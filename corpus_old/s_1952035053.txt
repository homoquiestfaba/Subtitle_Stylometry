[ Skipped item nr. 1 ]

-Detective.
-WiIkenson, right?

-Yeah.
-Okay, what have we got?

WeII, the techies are done,
so they covered her up.

This way.

-What?
-It's a hooker, sir.

It's pretty nasty.

-Any witnesses?
-No.

What's wrong with you?

BiII and I had a coupIe of drinks
after work Iast night.

UntiI 400 a.m.?

The victim was a young woman
in her thirties.

L.A. County Police are expected to
issue a statement here,

at the West Hollywood Sheriff's station,
in a few minutes.

But speculation is they believe the murders
may have been designed to imitate

those committed seven years ago
by Alonzo Rodriguez.

The murder weapon in use was a knife.

...knife...

...knife...

ln July, after an extraordinarily short
appeals process,

Alonzo Rodriguez was executed
for brutally murdering two women

-in West Hollywood, both prostitutes.
-Oh, my God.

Detective!

Detective, do you have any indication
why the murderer wouId imitate

the Rodriguez case?

I'm not going to taIk
about the Rodriguez case.

As far as I'm concerned,
this is an isoIated incident.

Can you confirm that
the victim was a prostitute?

It does appear that the woman
was a prostitute,

but I'm afraid that's aII I can say right now.

Detective Manning, one more question!

So, how much is Ieft?

We have enough for this month.
Maybe two more payments.

OnIy three peopIe have come
to Iook at it since May.

Drop the rent to 800.

Any more of
those effeminate fucking IittIe knocks,

you're gonna get
some unwanted attention, Detective.

Who says it'II be unwanted?

-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-Hey, I asked for PaImdaIe,

but I guess LASD thought
I'd fit in better in West HoIIywood.

Yeah, maybe outside the buiIding.

-No wonder your Iast partner quit.
-Let's get something straight.

Can I use that word?

Somebody must have been fucking
brain dead to assign a rookie to this case.

-Look, I spent 1 4 months...
-I reaIIy don't give a fuck.

Just don't throw any of that shit in my face.

Man, you're worse than my dad.

This just came in.

Isn't that supposed to stay seaIed?

Who eIse has seen this?

It's better to start up and dust down,
so the dust doesn't fIy up into your face.

-Good.
-Watch this.

I can hear you, EIIen.

I'm going out.

Take your damn piIIs.

No one's gonna rent this pIace
if they think the IandIady's a Iunatic.

WeII, what if the IandIord is?

-HeIIo?
-Hi, hon. lt's Dad.

-Hi, Daddy.
-Listen, darling,

l was thinking about visiting your mother.

No, you can't. PIease.

Why not? She's allowed visitors, isn't she?

Because she's isn't ready to see you yet,
that's why.

-Did she tell you that?
-No, the doctor did.

What about you? Did the doctor say
anything about you staying away from me?

No, Dad. Look,
l'm just really focused on Mom right now.

-What about dinner?
-Dad, l've got midterms.

l've got a lab due on Thursday,
there's a paper due in a couple of weeks

-and it's just...
-No, no, no, I understand.

-l'm just really busy right now.
-Yeah. I know.

No, it's okay. I've got...

-Got a Iot of work to do here, myseIf.
-l really gotta go.

-Sure.
-Maybe tomorrow.

Tomorrow. Okay.

Just a minute.

-HeIIo?
-I'm sorry,

I shouId have caIIed first.
I was waIking past,

-and I noticed your sign.
-Yes.

I've been Iooking for a quiet room,
and a guest house sounded IoveIy.

Come in.

SmeIIs good.

So, have you just moved to L.A.?

Not reaIIy.
I'm just Iooking for something new.

You know, something to inspire me.

Oh, I'm sorry. It's this way.

Great.

You wouId be weIcome to
use the kitchen on your own,

but the rent does incIude breakfast,

usuaIIy untiI about 900.

Or are you a Iate riser?

Yes, I'm afraid I am.

What is this, some kind of gang attack?

Not unIess the others
just stood around and watched.

This was one guy,
and he was cIearIy copying Rodriguez.

It's identicaI. Look at this.

There are aImost 40 separate incisions,

each with the same angIe of entry,

-same tearing motion.
-Lefty?

He definiteIy used his Ieft hand,

but each wound was created
with varying force.

My guess is
he was just trying to Iook Iike a Iefty.

-Bastard did his homework.
-Yeah. WeII, not compIeteIy.

The Rodriguez kiIIings
were acts of sadistic vioIence,

where both victims died
after muItipIe wounds.

PresumabIy so that
he couId watch them die sIowIy.

This one died immediateIy,

after the first incision to her throat.

He had a conscience?

WeII, it depends on
what you caII a conscience.

A case Iike this, actuaIIy,

you're casing
an entireIy different psychoIogicaI profiIe.

-Took pity on her, for Christ's sake.
-Wow. ReaI fucking sweetheart.

-Thank you, Sam.
-Hey...

I was sorry to hear about
aII that with your wife.

-Is she doing any better?
-No.

What do you do? I mean, for work.

Oh, I write.

So, I must have compIete quiet, and privacy.

I'd Iike to take it. Right away.

-But you haven't even asked the rent.
-WeII, I'm sure it's fair.

I have a great sense of those I can trust.

I'm MaIcoIm SIaight.

I'm EIIen Bunting.

My husband, Joe, weII, he works Iate...

It's important to me that
I wouId have the onIy key.

Oh, yes. Of course. Except for me.

But I can't be disturbed.

-You wiII taIk to your husband. Not at aII.
-Oh, he won't bother you.

WouId $1,000 a month be acceptabIe?
With breakfast.

I aImost forgot. About references...

I won't be needing those. Just privacy.

Thank you.

This is Miss SaIIy Harrison.

Or what's Ieft of her.

Her body was found
at approximateIy 315 a.m. Iast night

on the 8400 bIock of Sunset and OIive.

She was 23 years oId, 5'3'' taII,
Caucasian and a prostitute.

Thirty-nine separate knife wounds.

No witnesses,

no obvious suspects,

no motive.

Other than this bastard
is cIearIy copying Rodriguez's MO.

Okay. That's it.

Who are they?

Smith, LAPD.

And he brought the Feds.

They'II be aII over us on this
after ChandIer smoked them on Rodriguez.

-What are you doing?
-I toId you not to disturb me.

I just thought you might Iike some tea.

I'm sorry. Just Ieave it there, pIease.

-What's wrong with them?
-They were aII staring at me.

FoIIowing me.

Everywhere. It's a IittIe unnerving.

-Oh, weII, I'II have Joe come and take...
-No!

PIease, we've aIready taIked about this.
I don't want anyone eIse coming in here.

Ever.

-I'II bring them out.
-WeII,

-do you need anything eIse?
-Just a IittIe rest, I'm afraid.

Oh, and if you couId pick up some things
for me at the market?

-That's way too much.
-Keep it, pIease.

Whatever you think, bread, cereaI,
I'm not too particuIar.

Thank you.

About food.

I couIdn't see his face.
It was raining, and he was running away.

He was wearing one of those Iong coats,
Iike Neo.

-What was the coIor of the coat?
-PurpIe, dickhead!

Have Jim come in here for a sketch.

We need height and buiId,
maIe with a Iong, dark coat.

-When Jim's done, Iet him go.
-Let him go?

Get anything eIse out of him, keep him.

Right.

-What...
-Fuck off! Can I go now, man?

This is reaIIy wonderfuI, honey.

I got it at the deIi after cIass
about an hour ago.

StiII good.

You put her there.

-Amanda, pIease don't say that.
-Ask her doctors.

You were obsessive
and reIentIessIy controIIing.

Nothing she did was
ever good enough for you.

-You know, she toId me even in bed...
-Stop it!

Honey, I know I couId have
done things differentIy, but this is...

-There's more to this...
-You're to bIame for this.

Amanda, that's not true.

I have a reaIIy earIy cIass tomorrow, so...

-Okay, I'II caII you Iater.
-Bye.

What happened to the sign?

-I rented it.
-You rented it?

-He's aIready moved in.
-What?

A man. MaIcoIm something.

He's aIready given us
three months in advance.

And I didn't even have to Iower the rate
because I couId teII he reaIIy wanted it.

-I did incIude breakfast.
-That's from your famiIy.

No, it isn't.

He's been busy back there
taking down aII your mother's prints.

But don't... Don't go in there.

He onIy wants me to go back there.

Are you kidding?
Sure he's not some kind of wacko?

He's a bit eccentric.
Seems perfectIy harmIess.

Anyway, what choice do we have?

-Anything back from the techies?
-Not a Iot.

Let's see, there was nothing
under the fingernaiIs, no foreign fibers,

no signs of sexuaI activity.

He either surprised her or he knew her
because there are no signs of a struggIe.

So, other than the pimp,
nobody saw anything.

Right in the middIe of
fucking Sunset BouIevard.

-What about the Ietter?
-WeII, there are a bunch of prints,

but they onIy match the peopIe
who handIed it before it got here.

The maiI room, the post office,
and you, of course.

Nothing back yet on the paper
or the ink type.

That's it?

WeII, we stiII have someone on the pimp,
but he's cIean so far.

A cIean pimp? Now there's an oxymoron.

WeII, I doubt he's the kiIIer.

Of course he's not the kiIIer, you moron.

Now I know this is your first case
and you're trying reaI hard to impress

aII your fucking friends,

but I reaIIy need you
to start finding me some suspects

and stop wasting my time
confirming the innocent ones.

Now whisper something to me, quick.

-I don't know what you...
-Yeah, that's a good idea.

I'II check up on that. Thank you.

Joe!

Joe!

Joe!

I picked the big bear

and you picked the IittIe bear.

I'm sorry, mister,
but that is exactIy the bear that you picked.

These are for you, are they not?

-I Iike those.
-I know you do.

Joe!

Joe!

You're stiII here? Didn't you hear me?

-What's that smeII?
-GranoIa.

It's not for you.

-We got the Iate shift.
-WeII, just don't wake the Iodger.

And take your boots off
before you trudge drunkenIy up the stairs.

I wouId Iike to get some sIeep, too.

I'II do whatever I want.

Just take the medicine, EIIen, okay?

You foIIowing me, sweetheart?

What do you have, Sam?

AII of her reproductive organs
were removed,

as if he were giving her a cesarean section.

HoIy shit.

Better cover her up.

No. No, I'm okay.

There's more.

I was wrong. He's not imitating Rodriguez.
He is Rodriguez.

-Was she aIive?
-Through the whoIe thing.

Everything's identicaI. Strong right hand,

successive three-quarter-inch incisions,
curved bIade,

aIternating Ieft to right, then right to Ieft.

Sorry, Chan.
I know this makes you Iook bad.

He's back.

Wait a minute.

You're teIIing me that this guy,
who kiIIed these two hookers,

is the same guy that kiIIed the two women

Rodriguez was executed for
seven years ago?

-I'm sure of it.
-That is impossibIe.

There was bIood from both victims
in Rodriguez's apartment

and the murder weapon.

WeII, somebody must have
framed Rodriguez

because it's the same handiwork.

I mean, exactIy the same.
He's teIIing us it's him,

Iike a surgeon signing his name.

And another thing.

You know who he's imitating, don't you?

-Who?
-Thirty-nine incisions on the Iast one.

The whoIe body mutiIation, prostitutes...

I shouId have seen it.

Fuck.

Who? Who is he imitating?

Jack the Ripper.

Another prostitute was brutally murdered
in West Hollywood last night.

Last night's violent murder here
on Sunset Boulevard is the second...

...second exact recreation
of the Jack the Ripper murders,

which occurred over 100 years ago.

News 15 sources believe
the LASD Coroner's Office

will shortly issue a report with evidence
that both women were cut exactly 39 times.

...killed at least 6 women in 1888,
was never caught.

You stay here, Timmy.

The violent murder of two women
in West Hollywood this week

seems to precisely mimic

the extraordinarily brutal crimes
committed by

Jack the Ripper, in London,
over 100 years ago.

Further, we are exploring the possibility

that these recent murders
may have been committed by

the same man who killed two women

in a similar fashion

on Sunset Boulevard seven years ago.

-Detective!
-Detective, over here!

-Just one question!
-Over here! Does this mean...

ls it possible Alonzo Rodriguez
was innocent of the two murders

for which you and the DA
had him executed?

ln light of new evidence,
LASD has informed the mayor's office

that it intends to reopen the Rodriguez file.

Sir! Detective!

Detective! Question, one more question!

Detective Manning, please, over here!
Sir! Please, please, sir!

TeII Gregor to puII up anything he can
on Jack the Ripper.

TimeIine, number of victims,
odd facts, anything.

This Iunatic's not done yet.

-Where you going?
-Be back around 400.

Mr. Manning.

Hi, I'm Dr. Stevens.

I'd Iike to speak with you for a moment
before you see your wife.

She's making some progress, but stiII
experiences intense bouts of depression.

It's necessary for us to
have someone with her at aII times.

Your daughter was adamant that
you not be aIIowed to visit.

Yeah, you peopIe didn't seem
so excited about me being here either.

WeII, that's more your daughter's
feeIing right now than your wife's.

Or mine.

But just to be safe,
if she begins to get upset, even sIightIy,

I'm going to have the attending nurse
stop the visit immediateIy.

What do you peopIe think I'm gonna do?

She's my wife, for Christ's sake.

Just don't expect too much,
she's extremeIy...

Are you gonna Iet me see her, or not?

HeIIo, ChandIer.

Hi, Mags.

It's good to see you.

Yeah, I'm sure I Iook wonderfuI.

No, you Iook good.

I hope it's aII right I came.

I suppose I'II aIways have this.

Why'd you do it, Mags?

You have to go.

-Mags, pIease.
-No, I can't. PIease.

Nurse.

You have to Ieave now, Mr. Manning.

PIease.

Now!

Oh, God!

No! Leave me aIone!

Don't touch me!

PIease!

Go! Go!

Leave me aIone! No! PIease, no!

I'd have come for that.

It was deIicious.

Thank you.

WouId you Iike some coffee?

That wouId be nice.

Where's your husband?

-He's at work.
-I thought he worked nights.

He Ieaves earIy.

He goes to the gym,
and then does who-knows-what beforehand.

And gets in at 300 a.m.?

You heard him.

That doesn't Ieave you
a Iot of time together.

No.

WeII, what time did you get in Iast night?
You must have been very quiet.

I'm sorry.
I know that's none of my business.

I'm afraid I have some work I need to do.

Thank you for the breakfast.

I'm gIad you came over.

There's no damn way I'm handing this
over to the Feds. Or LAPD.

Look, it's too Iate, okay?
The Fed profiIer is meeting with Sam now

-and they wanna see us at 300.
-Shit.

AII right. We'II meet the profiIer.

But when Smith comes,
you don't show him a fucking thing.

You got me? Not a fucking thing.

What are you doing?

I was trying to dry my trousers
and they caught fire.

You're weIcome to use the dryer
in the house.

WeII, these are Iost now.

Think I might borrow one or two
of the things I saw in the cIoset?

Sure.

It seems your husband and I are a cIose fit.

So, he wants everything.

Who was kiIIed, how many, when, how,

-poIice reports...
-From 1888?

Come on, you don't need me for this.

Everything on Jack the Ripper
is in the pubIic record.

Why don't you just GoogIe it?

Or go get the book
down at the Barnes & NobIe?

Look, he wants it by 300, okay?

I mean, it beats me why you didn't
think it was the same guy aII aIong.

-Going after whores, cutting them up...
-Find me the fiIe number, wouId you?

AII right, here it is.

RoIston, with an ''O.''

WeII, two ''O's.'' 1 422, aisIe 1 4, second sheIf.

So you fried the wrong guy?

That's a bummer, huh, Detective?

Fuck off.

-What the fuck are you doing?
-Why are you foIIowing me?

Fuck you, man!

Just making sure you had the fiIes.

Get the fuck out of here.

You know your man Manning
was here today.

-You know, the cop on TV.
-Manning's here?

Just went out the back door.

Shit.

-Did he take anything?
-Said he couIdn't find

what he wanted. AsshoIe.

I go back there to make sure he found
the fiIes, bastard puIIs a gun on me.

A gun? What fiIe name did he want?

RoIston, with an ''O.''

WeII, two ''O's.''

What am I doing?

I forgot my bag.

Who were you expecting?

Sorry. Sorry I'm Iate.

Doctor's appointment.
So, Doc, what have we got?

How big, how oId, Hispanic, White,
Asian, what?

WeII, I can't give you specifics, Detective.
You know that.

Just a generaI profiIe.

And even there, we have to be carefuI
about making too many assumptions,

as your kiIIer IikeIy knows he's being
evaIuated and wiII modify his behavior

to keep from giving away too much.

So what you're basicaIIy saying is
that he couId be messing with us?

Yes, that's right.

Jesus Christ, couId somebody
pIease teII me something we don't know?

Come on, ChandIer.
Let's at Ieast hear what she's got.

The precise repIication
of the murders of Jack the Ripper

is cIearIy psychotic obsessive.

And we have to consider that
the comments made by Detective Manning

severaI years ago,
comparing Rodriguez to the Ripper,

-may weII have triggered this obsession.
-BuIIshit!

That was after
he'd cut two women to pieces.

What is this,
some kind of retroactive obsession?

She may be right, Chan.

Those first two murders
were aII over the pIace.

They were cut up, but no reaI MO,
not Iike these ones.

Gee, thanks, Sam.

He's obviousIy extremeIy inteIIigent,

and from the way
the Iast victim was dissected,

it Iooks Iike he's had
some formaI medicaI training.

What about motive?

DifficuIt. It couId be a consequence
of any number of psychoIogicaI factors,

psychosis, schizophrenia, bi-poIar,
chiIdhood trauma, sexuaI abuse.

A seriaI kiIIer's motives, anger,
desire for revenge, whatever,

are aImost aIways profoundIy abstracted.

In this case, it's odd because,
whiIe there's enormous sexuaI rage,

there isn't any actuaI sexuaI assauIt.

-Is that typicaI?
-Nothing's typicaI. It is unusuaI,

however, to find such a vioIent
manifestation of hyper-vigiIant psychosis

directed at the opposing gender
without an autoerotic trigger.

It means he gets off on the kiIIing.

And the chase, of course.
Not unIike the originaI Jack the Ripper.

What about the gap?
Why wouId he kiII two women,

then disappear for seven years,
then start aII over again?

Two, ten, twenty years,
sometimes they're abIe to stop aItogether.

I imagine that, most of the time,
this guy appears normaI,

Iike you and I. Has a job, goes to work,
maybe even has a famiIy.

So, he just couIdn't hoId off anymore?

PossibIy.

Or?

Or he wants to get back in the IimeIight
again, misses the cat and mouse.

But my guess is
he's fixated on you, Detective.

I think he wants to get cIoser, and is
Ieaving these Ripper cIues on purpose.

That's where I wouId start.

Thought you might have
some scissors Iying around.

Two-for-one tonight, hon.

-Piss off!
-You piss off, Iimp dick!

What about this guy?

He Iooks kind of cute.

WeII?

WeII, I think this is an exact re-creation
of the doubIe Ripper murders

of EIizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes
on September 30, 1888.

You've been doing your homework.

The Ietter with the red ink
that we received three days ago?

That is word for word the same
as the ''Dear Boss'' Ietter

that the Ripper sent three days before
Stride and Eddowes were murdered.

-Got something here, Detective.
-I know.

-Looks Iike about a 10.
-Yeah.

WiII you get these peopIe the heII back?

I want a photograph of that.

Excuse me.

''Batty''? What does that mean?

I don't know,
but it sure as heII means something.

Hey, shouIdn't we have forensics do that?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

It's been cut with scissors.

How did you know that was in there?

A piece of Catherine Eddowes' apron
was found on GouIston Street

the night of the doubIe Ripper murders.

It had been used to scrawI
a message in bIood, just Iike over there.

-And there was a witness.
-What?

The Eddowes murder.

There was a witness.

How taII was he?

WeII, he was maybe about your height.

Was he White, BIack, Hispanic?

I onIy saw him from behind.

It was just too dark.

But he was wearing a Iong, dark coat.

Oh, and he was carrying a smaII,

bIack

bag.

...over 100 years ago.

And speculation is growing
that this may in fact be

the same killer who murdered
two prostitutes on Sunset Boulevard

seven years ago.

Which would mean the L.A. County
Sheriff's Office and District Attorney

may have wrongly convicted
and executed Alonzo Rodriguez.

How many more innocent peopIe
Iike AIonzo Rodriguez must die

before we reaIize that it's the death penaIty
itseIf that's the mistake?

Right now, there are 600...

No, stay. Stay. It's a zoo out there.

...awaiting execution in California prisons,

140 of whom no longer even have
lawyers to represent them.

Now, do the math.

More innocent people will die
because of this archaic...

This guy is intentionaIIy stoking up
the Latino community.

Things couId get nasty for a whiIe.

Yeah, but he's right. I missed something.

What?

CIose the door.

What's this?

The Lusk Ietter?

The one that the Ripper sent to George Lusk

after the doubIe murders
of Stride and Eddowes?

Did this just come in?

It was in the Rodriguez fiIe.

Rodriguez?

-That was seven years ago.
-You remember what the Fed profiIer said?

-Yeah.
-WeII, she was right.

After we arrested Rodriguez,
I made some offhand comment to the press

about how we'd gotten rid
of a modern day Jack the Ripper.

A few days Iater, the Ietter arrived.

You know, strange shit comes in here
aII the time. I just tossed it in the fiIe.

I compIeteIy forgot about it, untiI
we received the ''Dear Boss'' Ietter Iast week.

WeII, we don't know it's from the same guy.

No, I had it tested, outside.
Ink, paper, handwriting,

-it's aII the same.
-You took something

out of Rodriguez's fiIe, tested it,
and didn't teII anyone about it?

Jesus Christ, you are such a fucking rookie.

How Iong do you think it wouId take
for Smith and the Feds to move in here

once they found out
we'd missed key evidence

on the Rodriguez case? Take a Iook at this.

He's been matching the originaI Ripper
victim for victim.

Just Annie Chapman
and Mary Jane KeIIy Ieft.

If we don't catch this guy,
he's gonna kiII two more women

and then what?
Disappear for another seven fucking years?

We got a week. Maybe two, and that's it!

You think Smith's gonna come in here
and heIp us catch this guy?

Hey, what's this?

It's the footprint from
the doubIe murder scene.

It's a boot, actuaIIy.

Size 10. Made by Raptor Footwear
out of Washington State.

Rubber soIe. You couId find these
aII over the pIace 10 years ago.

Tread's worn thin.

-HeIIo?
-Detective Manning,

-l have the Mayor for you.
-Hi, BiII.

l need you to come down to City Hall.

Yeah...

No, I'II be there.

...and that Detective Manning
drew his service revoIver

and pointed it at the attendant

in a threatening manner
without provocation.

Further, Detective Manning has
systematicaIIy excIuded

aII outside agencies
from the information chain

in order to impede an independent review

of the case by the LAPD
and the FBI in particuIar.

TeII us what you took from Rodriguez's fiIe.

AII this is buIIshit! Come on, BiII.

Can't you see Smith's just trying
to weaseI his way into this?

What, you're gonna Iet him?

Threatening a co-worker
is hardIy buIIshit, Manning.

IA shouId have shut down
your antiquated cowboy crap years ago.

You're gonna have to
take some time off, ChandIer.

Oh, so I guess you found
your scapegoat for this one, huh, BiII?

It is our decision, therefore,
that Detective Manning is hereby suspended

-pending psychoIogicaI evaIuation...
-Fuck this shit.

...and a more formaI
and comprehensive review

of these charges by InternaI Affairs.
Without pay.

Just a minute.

Room service.

Look at you.

I got mud on them Iast night,
waIking across the garden.

I cIeaned them in the sink, I'm sorry.

Those oId things, who cares?

I recognize that shirt.

Yeah, it fits perfectIy.

WeII, if you don't need anything eIse...

There you are.

What are you doing back here?

I'm washing your boots.

Smith orchestrated this.

So what are you gonna do?

I don't know.

My daughter won't speak to me,

my wife can't speak to me.

Who knows,
maybe you and I shouId hang out

with some of your interior decorator friends.

You do need a break.

Not untiI I see this Iunatic hang.

I thought you didn't beIieve
in the death penaIty.

You've been watching too much TV.

StiII meeting this Ripper author
with me tomorrow?

What, that guy? What's the point?

We know everything about
what Jack the Ripper did.

Names of victims, where, when, and how.
We don't know him,

who he was.

There is no him, ChandIer.
The Ripper was never caught.

Yeah, but we know the names
of aII the main suspects.

It's my guess this Iunatic
is emuIating one of them.

-What do I teII Smith?
-Nothing.

Shit.

You Ieaked it.

-Watch yourseIf, Detective.
-That footprint

was probabIy the onIy piece of information
the kiIIer didn't know we had.

I mean, how eIse are we...

There are other factors
invoIved here, WiIkenson,

that you don't know about.

The city is in hysterics. The pubIic wants to
know that we're making progress.

Are we trying to catch this guy,
or run a PR campaign?

Because the onIy progress I see is
towards more peopIe getting kiIIed.

lt turns out l've made a great many mistakes.

Alonzo Rodriguez's execution
should never have happened.

Because the burden of proof in CaIifornia
death penaIty cases is too reIaxed?

Not just CaIifornia. Look.

How many convictions have been
overturned based on new DNA evidence?

Check it out. Manning's Iost it.

lt's not that l think serial killers
don't deserve to die...

The death penalty, it presupposes
the infallibility of a judicial system

where mistakes are made aII the time,

and that means that
innocent peopIe wiII continue to die.

AIonzo Rodriguez was one of them.

My part in that is something
l'm gonna have to live with for a long time.

Detective! Detective.

Rumor has it that you've been fired,
and that LAPD has taken over the case.

Is that true?

Things aren't aIways
as simpIe as they seem.

Joe, there's something odd
going on with MaIcoIm. I think he...

Wait, hoId on. Who's MaIcoIm?

Our Iodger.

AII right, God damn it, pIease,
just cut the crap.

-No, Joe, Iisten.
-No, stop it! You Iisten.

There is no one back there.

Don't say that. You...

-Okay. AII right. Get up.
-Listen, Iisten.

-Get up! I'm so sick of this!
-He's gone out!

-Come on, come on!
-No! Wait!

Promise me! Promise me you'II stop
this nonsense if there's no one there!

-He's out!
-Promise me!

-Yes.
-Say it! Say, ''I promise.''

I promise.

Is anybody in there?

Is anyone in there?

No.

There's no one in there.

Joe!

lt's Amanda. l'm not in.
Please leave a message.

Amanda, honey, hi, it's Dad.
Sorry I'm caIIing so Iate.

I hope you can caII me back,
because I'd reaIIy Iove to see you.

I know I haven't been there much
for you or for your mother,

but l'm sure you know l went to the clinic
yesterday and saw Mom.

She wasn't too happy to see me,
but she looked good.

Well, l mean, it was good to see her.

Maybe we could
go over there together and...

Yeah, why the heII is Manning's name
on the suspect Iist?

When?

He steaIs evidence, and then
he asks you not to teII anyone? Why?

TeII him, Gregor.

After you Ieft my desk,
Captain Smith and the IA guys came back,

and they made me show them
what I was doing.

Some of these sites you wouIdn't beIieve.

This site, IuskfromheII.com,

it's named after the ''From HeII'' Ietter
that the Ripper sent to George Lusk in 1888,

aIong with haIf
of Catherine Eddowes' kidney.

He showed you the Lusk Ietter,
didn't he, Detective?

The one he took from the Rodriguez fiIe?

Yeah, weII, anyway,
Detective Manning was in the registry.

So what?
Look, Manning's theory is to try to find out

which of the originaI Ripper suspects
the kiIIer is emuIating.

And then, we'II be abIe
to predict his behavior.

So, digging through some obscure
Ripper sites is just good research.

That's exactIy what I thought,

but then I aIso found Manning's footprint
in registries of some of the smaIIer,

more intensively violent sites,
where he had logged in using an alias.

Anyway, the weird thing is,

it turns out that Manning has been
a reguIar on a coupIe of these sites

since earIy '97.

That is about 18 months
before the first two murders.

The ones Rodriguez was framed for.

And that means that Manning has been
into this Ripper shit for years!

Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense.
Why wouIdn't he have said anything?

Because he's a fucking Iunatic, that's why!

We beIieve Manning constructed
the case against Rodriguez,

framing him for the first two murders
seven years ago.

We beIieve now that he's setting up
someone eIse to take the faII aII over again.

We've done some digging into
Manning's past. He fits the profiIe exactIy.

What profiIe? The IoneIy burned-out cop
with maritaI probIems?

No, this is textbook.

In and out of foster homes as a kid,
troubIed famiIy Iife, suicidaI wife,

depression, it's aII there.

You just described haIf of L.A.,
for Christ's sake!

Look, there's not a chance in heII
Manning kiIIed anyone.

If you are too cIose, Detective,
you need to teII me now.

What are we doing here?

I don't want Smith
seeing us meet with Lester.

Interesting.

ReIax. He said 400. Give him a few minutes.

Look. TeII me, why did you want us
to assembIe a fiIe on Jack the Ripper

-if you know so much about him yourseIf?
-No, the fiIe was for you.

The TumbIety case is interesting.
No one reaIIy knew he was a suspect

untiI about 10 years ago,

when a Ietter written
by a ScotIand Yard Chief Inspector,

John LittIechiId,
was discovered by a journaIist,

when seaIed documents were reIeased

under the British Freedom
of Information Act.

He was an American
who Iived in EngIand for a short time,

his arrivaI in London neatIy coinciding
with when the murders started

and his departure with
when they suddenIy stopped.

The TumbIety theory hoIds
that no one knew he was a suspect

because certain members
of the poIice kept it quiet

and avoided reIeasing
any information on him

for fear he might fIee,
which, of course, he did in the end anyway.

And how do the facts here point to him?

WeII, they don't, reaIIy, except for
what your witness said about a bIack bag.

l remember reading somewhere
that Tumblety left behind a black bag.

At Ieast, I think it was TumbIety.
I'II have to check my notes.

Yeah, so what have we got here?

KIosowski, the medicaI student,
Isenschmidt, the butcher,

TumbIety, the American. Which one is it?

WeII, if you want one,
my guess is Isenschmidt, the butcher.

But I'd be carefuI about the obvious.

There's a reason
the Ripper was never caught.

And I doubt your kiIIer is Ieaving behind
any cIues he doesn't want to.

How Iong you been a Ripper expert?

A Iong time.

Why do you ask?

Jack the Ripper was
the personification of eviI.

No motive, fIauntingIy vioIent, never caught.

Iago with a knife.

A fucking shadow Iurking
in the darkest corner of the human mind.

How Iong?
He's the reason the poIice even exist.

Anyway, enough of the 20 questions.

Look, if we're gonna cover
aII the names on this Iist,

we need to spIit up.
Why don't you drop me off?

No, no, no, no.
Let's just stay together, okay?

It's not that many names,
and besides, you're on suspension.

That's touching.

Sure, why not? Let's stick together.
Like Smith and Jones.

Thank you, ma'am.

Dead's a good aIibi. Who's next?

AII right, next. Joe Bunting.

Another one of those at the gym on Sunset
the night of the doubIe murders.

Might expIain the bIack bag.
Lives on 1 29 WhitechapeI Street.

It's a pretty thin connection,

but WhitechapeI is the 1 .5 square miIe area
on the East End of London

where aII the Ripper murders took pIace.

It aIso happens to be
exactIy the same size as West HoIIywood.

-Mrs. Bunting?
-Yes?

Hi, I'm Detective WiIkenson, and this is...

I recognize you.

We'd Iike to come in
and ask a few questions

if you and your husband are avaiIabIe.

WeII, he's not here,
and I just got my son down for a nap,

so Joe wiII be back Iater, in the morning,
if you'd Iike to come back then.

Ma'am, we won't be more
than a few minutes. PIease.

UsuaIIy he gets off around 1 00,

but he doesn't aIways come straight home.

It wouId be heIpfuI
if we couId speak with him tonight.

Where is he?

He sometimes goes to the gym first,
with BiII.

They work together,
and it's near their buiIding.

But it's too Iate.
They're probabIy at work by now.

What's the address?

19000 Sunset near Doheny.
He's a security guard.

-They both are.
-What's back there?

That's just an extra room where we store
some of my husband's oId things.

-Anybody staying there?
-No.

Mind if we take a Iook?

No.

-Whose are these?
-Those are my husband's.

WeII, thank you, Mrs. Bunting.
I'm sorry we troubIed you.

Okay.

She's hiding something.

You notice the way she wouIdn't Iook at us
when we went into the guest house?

Maybe she kicked her husband
out of the house.

Get a search warrant from RoIIins.

I want to take a good Iook back there.

They're not gonna find anything.
They're not gonna find anything.

Were you and Bunting working Iast week,
the nights of March 1 4 and 1 7?

I don't know. Maybe.

What's aII this?

You finish with him. I'II caII you in an hour.

Where are you going?

Annie Chapman.

Same incisions.

Same body position, same everything.

And her uterus is missing.

Where have you been?

What's that supposed to mean?

You didn't go home, did you?

Most peopIe with a bottIe of red ink

wouId have it hidden away these days,
don't you think?

I don't know what you mean.

Come now, EIIen.
You must have read the papers.

-No, I...
-You can't just come in here

and start snooping around.

I wasn't. I wasn't.

I was just trying to cIean behind the cabinet,
it must have tipped over.

No one wiII know.

EIIen, pIease.

I shouIdn't have raised my voice, I'm sorry.

-No, no.
-I'm sorry.

I shouIdn't have raised my voice.

Shit, man, don't do that!
I might have shot you.

Yeah, right. You're gonna have to
Iearn how to shoot first.

Where you been? The cops were here.

What'd you teII them?

Take it easy. Nothing.

They just asked about EIIen, what
we did Iast week, a bunch of stupid shit.

That's it?
They didn't ask about anything eIse?

Like what?

-It's gotta be here somewhere.
-Captain!

It Iooks Iike we found something.

Got him.

CaII me the minute he shows up.

Shit!

You're Ieaving.

TumbIety.

PIease.

No one has to know.

I'II do anything.

HeIIo?

I'm Iooking for Street WiIkenson. Is this...

Hey, Cat. It's okay, baby. I got it.

-Hi.
-Hi. Who's that?

-My wife.
-Your wife?

She's reaIIy been Iooking forward
to meeting you.

Here's me thinking I was being
so fucking open minded.

Yeah, right. What do you want? It's Iate.

It's not Isenschmidt. It's TumbIety.

Bunting is TumbIety, and that bIack bag
is in that guesthouse. I'm sure of it.

ChandIer, there's stiII nothing
to connect any of this to Bunting.

We find that bIack bag, and there wiII be.
Let's go.

Wait, wait, wait. You mean right now?

Listen, this prick Smith has
been aIready through my apartment.

He's got two of LAPD's finest staked out,
waiting for me. We don't have much time.

ChandIer, why do you care so much about
what Smith knows or doesn't know?

We're aII after the same guy.

WeII, since when have
you started defending Smith?

You toId him?

-Hey, Iook, you can't just go over there.
-BuIIshit!

This asshoIe has got one more murder,

-then he fucking disappears.
-Okay, just one second.

Let me get dressed.

We stiII have to caII Smith.

The onIy prints I found
match those of a woman,

presumabIy the wife.
Same as those in the main house.

-That's it. I'II teII the Captain.
-Okay.

We're done here.

It's cIean, no bIack bag, no prints.
Nobody's been back here, ChandIer.

Let's go. Smith wants to taIk to us.

No, there's something eIse.

They knew we were getting cIose.

Why eIse wouId they aII Ieave
in the middIe of the night?

I'm gonna take another Iook around.

Oh, what? You think I shouId go with you?

Just don't touch anything.

-Let's get everybody out of here.
-Okay. There's nothing.

-It's cIean.
-Get someone in here to open this thing!

You fucking Ieft him out there?

-It's stuck.
-Just open the damn thing!

Bingo.

-Jesus, God.
-Right.

No, you'd better do this.

I wouIdn't want to taint anything.

Yeah, it's Smith.
Get a car over to 19000 Sunset.

There's a security guard there,
his name is Joe Bunting.

He works in the security booth.

No, no, no. Just hoId him untiI I get there.

Get over to the Iab right away.
Run them for prints

and against the ink
in both of the earIier Ietters.

CaII me as soon as you get resuIts.
I don't care what time it is.

WeII, it Iooks Iike LAPD got their man.

-HoId out your hands.
-What for?

There's cIearIy been nobody Iiving here,

and my guess is that
we won't find prints anywhere.

WiII we, Manning?

Now hoId out your hands.

I'II be there in 15 minutes.

Okay. Bye.

You have the right to remain siIent.

-Anything you say can and wiII be used...
-What, you think I pIanted aII of this?

You have the right to an attorney.

-Oh, don't fucking do this!
-Shut up, Manning. It's over!

When you get through here,
take him down to the station.

Do you understand these rights
as I have read them?

Excuse me. We're Iooking for Joe Bunting.

Tape it up. Get everybody out of there.

Yeah. Smith.

Bunting's gone AWOL, sir.
Nobody knows where he is.

WeII, find him, God damn it!

-Hey, Amanda.
-Hey, Matt.

-Are you guys coming out Iater?
-No, I got a Iab due tomorrow.

-That's a bummer.
-Yeah. Later.

See you.

-Everybody out.
-Take a Iook at this.

-I have to take you in.
-This is a map of London.

These red marks, they're the exact Iocation
of aII the WhitechapeI murders in 1888.

George Yard, Buck's Row, Hanbury Street,

doubIe murder at Mitre Square,
and the Iast murder at MiIIer's Court.

Now this is West HoIIywood,

and the red marks are the Iocations
of aII the Sunset murders over the Iast week.

-So?
-So, there's one too many.

-We've got a match.
-With what?

The red ink is a positive match
with the ink from the Iast Ietter,

and there are traces of bIood
mixed in with it.

We've got a pair of Raptor boots
the exact same size as the footprint

and we're testing fibers
from some burned cIothes

we found buried at the side of the house.

Yeah, I suppose you think
I pIanted aII that, too.

-Thanks.
-See, this one... This one's new.

Oh, God! No!

Get me the fuck out of these things, now!

It's an apartment buiIding, 19015 Sunset.

AII right, what eIse do we have
on Mary Jane KeIIy

other than she was the Iast victim?

She was butchered beyond recognition.

In her own room.

Answer, damn it!

-Which one?
-221 .

Amanda!

Hey, get out of there!

What the heII is going on?

-Who are you?
-Who are you?

I'm Amanda's father.
You know where she is?

Yeah, I just saw her
a coupIe of minutes ago.

-She was headed to the House of BIues.
-Shit!

-What about her? Is that her?
-Yeah, it is. Thank God!

Hey!

-Oh, Christ! No!
-Shit!

Amanda, get down! PoIice!

-Are you aII right?
-I'm okay.

-Are you hurt?
-I'm okay.

Stay with her. I'II be back.

-I'II be back.
-No, don't...

-It's okay.
-He's headed back to the house.

-Don't!
-Stop! PoIice!

Requesting Code 3 back up.
Suspect heading to 1 29 WhitechapeI Street.

PoIice. Come out!

Come out! It's over!

Shit.

Right here.

He's inside the house.
Give me that fIashIight.

Go back. Go back around the front.

Oh, my God!

Drop it! Now!

What was that?

Oh, my God.

Oh, Jesus.

It's unbeIievabIe.

It expIains how she was abIe to
get so cIose to each of her victims.

She's advanced schizophrenic.

She never recovered from
a traumatic chiIdbirth about 8 years ago.

Seems the OBGYN reaIIy messed things up,
and after two days of an intense Iabor,

finaIIy does a cesarean,
but the baby is dead. StiIIborn.

After the baby died, about 8 years ago,
the first wave of murders began.

Sometime after that,
to escape the horrors of her experience

and Iater her own brutaIIy vioIent behavior,
she retreated into her imaginary worId.

It's amazing, reaIIy.
She's an extraordinariIy inteIIigent woman,

and she describes everything
in meticuIous detaiI.

She taIks mainIy
about two imaginary characters.

Timmy, which is the name
of her stiIIborn son,

and a Iodger, whom she invented recentIy,

a kind of romantic fantasy,
and aIso to compIete the seIf-deIusion

that she was not the person
imitating Jack the Ripper

and kiIIing these young women.

It's aII in her mind.

She beIieves that Timmy
and the Iodger exist

in the same way
that she beIieves you and I exist.

So she's compIeteIy insane?

She simpIy invented a person
who was obsessed with Jack the Ripper

through whom she couId IiteraIIy
conduct exhaustive research

and act out these brutaIIy savage crimes.

And you have to remember that
your evidence against Rodriguez

was aIways circumstantiaI.

She couId never have done aII of this
as EIIen.

-Captain, we're gonna bring her out, okay?
-Car's ready.

Thank you.

Don't worry. We'II Iook after Timmy for you.

Timmy?

Timmy died 7 years ago.

At 2.'30 this morning, the LAPD and the FBl,

working with the L.A. County Sheriffs
here at the West Hollywood Station,

arrested Mrs. Ellen Bunting

at her house on Whitechapel Street
in West Hollywood.

Mrs. Bunting will shortly undergo
a complete psychological...

Why didn't you go with Smith?

You don't think it's her.

HeIIo?

I saw the sign out front,
about the room for rent?

Oh, yes, pIease. Come in.

So, did you just move to Santa Monica?

Not reaIIy, no.

I'm just Iooking for something new.

Something to inspire me.

Great. Let me show you around.
