KRABS:
Okay, everybody, settle down.

Welcome to the Komedy Krab!

( <i>chuckling )</i>

( <i>laughing )</i>

Now, please give a warm welcome
to our first comic,

the indiscernible
Doogie Williams!

Good evening, folks.

I'm going to skip the jokes

and get right to the part
where I throw pies at you.

( <i>pies smashing )</i>

( <i>laughing )</i>

I hope I do as good as that guy.

Man, those people
will laugh at anything.

Hey, don't sweat it, kid.

I got 'em all warmed up for you.

KRABS:
Put your fins together
for SpongeBob SquarePants!

SANDY:
Go get 'em,
SpongeBob!

Whoo-hoo!

Hey, hey, hey,
ladies and jellyfish,

have you ever noticed
salt shakers?

I mean, you fill them up
every night at closing

and, I mean,
where does it all go?

Huh? You know what I mean?

( <i>cricket chirping )</i>

( <i>chirping )</i>

And tomatoes... what's the deal
on those things?

( <i>chuckles weakly )</i>

SPONGEBOB:
Because, I mean,

you chop them up
into slices, but...

What are they, vegetables or...

fruit?

And what does that make ketchup?

FISH:
Oh, brother!

This guy stinks!

Hey! Hey,
funny guy!

I got a joke for you!

What smells rotten

and puts people to sleep?

Um, noxious gas?

No! Your act!

( <i>laughing uproariously )</i>

Did you ever notice how, uh...

...forks, uh...

FISH:
Forks?!
Come on!

( <i>booing )</i>

( <i>thinking ):
Quick, SpongeBob!</i>

<i>Make a witty observation!</i>

( <i>booing )</i>

P.U.

( <i>crowd booing )</i>

Get out of here!

Did you ever notice
how big squirrels' teeth are?

( <i>chuckling )</i>

That's true.

Huh?

I mean, hey,

you could land a plane
on those things.

( <i>laughing )</i>

And what's up
with that squirrel fur?

I guess fleas need a home, too.

( <i>laughing harder )</i>

Squirrel fur!

And they smell!

Uh, but hey, you'd stink, too,

if you spent three months
buried in dirt.

( <i>others laughing )</i>

( <i>laughing )</i>

Hey, why does it take
more than one squirrel

to change a lightbulb?

FISH:
Why?!

Because they're so darn stupid!

( <i>laughing hysterically )</i>

( <i>guffawing )</i>

Oh, that's
a good one,
eh, Sandy?

Uh, y-yeah.

( <i>laughing uncontrollably )</i>

That was fantastic, boy!

You really knocked them out!

I think I'll do this
joke night again

with <i>you as the headliner!</i>

I never thought I could be
a headliner!

Whatever that is.

The headliner's the one

who cleans up after the show.

Well, at least I don't have
to clean up my act!

( <i>laughs )</i>

Stick with
the squirrel jokes, boy.

Now get busy!

Mops, mops, mops.

What's up with those things?

I mean, really!

Oh, hey, Sandy.

Howdy, SpongeBob.

Did you like the show?

Well, ac-actually,
SpongeBob, no.

Those jokes are hurtful
and you know it.

Come on, Sandy.

I was just joking.

I mean, everybody knows

you're the smartest one
at Bikini Bottom.

Well, I can't argue with that.

We all gotta laugh
at ourselves once in a while.

I do it all the time!

( <i>laughing )</i>

( <i>laughing )</i>

( <i>chuckling )</i>

You're right, SpongeBob.

I was being
a little too sensitive.

No hard feelings.

Okay, deodorant.

Huh, let's see.

Roll-on or stick?

I think she should buy both.

( <i>laughs )</i>

Huh?

FISH:
Hey, look, guys!

It's the stupid squirrel!

I know...

let's try
and communicate
with it.

ALL:
Duh...

( <i>laughing )</i>

Hmph!

Hello, little critter.

What's your name?

Don't stand too close
to a squirrel, Billy.

You'll catch its stupid.

Okay, Mom.

Stupidity isn't a virus,

but it sure is spreading
like one.

CROWD ( <i>chanting ):
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!</i>

SpongeBob! SpongeBob!

â™ª La-la-la-la la-la-la â™ª

â™ª Squirrely, squirrely,
squirrely, squirrel. â™ª

Because they're stupid.

Because they're stupid.

Hey, uh, SpongeBob?

Oh, hi, Sandy.

Um, I need to talk to you

about them squirrel jokes.

We already talked
about that, remember?

( <i>laughing )</i>

SpongeBob, this is serious.

Since you've been
telling them jokes,

people have been treating me
different.

SpongeBob, five minutes.

Uh, uh...

( <i>slowly ):
Hel-lo... Sandy.</i>

Me... Patrick.

Do you...
un-der-stand?

Squirrels.

Y-y-you see?!
That's what I'm
talking about.

That's just Patrick.

He's fooling around.

I'm just asking you as a friend,

please lay off them
squirrel jokes, okay?

Tell some of them
other jokes you got.

( <i>nervously ):
Other jokes?</i>

Bah!

I got a million of them.

Thanks, SpongeBob.

I knew you'd understand.

( <i>chanting ):
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!</i>

KRABS:
Put your fins together
for SpongeBob SquarePants!

( <i>cheering )</i>

Uh, hi.

( <i>chuckles nervously )</i>

Uh, did you hear about
the goldfish who went bankrupt?

Now, he's a bronze fish.

( <i>rimshot )</i>

What? What
did he say?

I guess you heard that one.

SANDY:
I haven't
heard it!

Good one, SpongeBob.

Thank you, you're too kind.

Hey, what about this water?

I mean, the stuff's everywhere.

Tell the one about
the squirrel and
the lightbulbs!

Uh... hey, what about
this thing?

Huh? Huh?

Get on with the squirrel jokes!

CROWD ( <i>chanting ):
Squirrel jokes! Squirrel jokes!
Squirrel jokes! Squirrel jokes!</i>

Squirrel jokes! Squirrel jokes!
Squirrel jokes!

( <i>thinking ):
What do I do? What do I do?</i>

<i>SpongeBob, you've got
a choice to make:</i>

<i>Your friends or your career?</i>

CROWD:
Squirrel jokes! Squirrel jokes!

( <i>all gasp )</i>

Howdy, y'all!

( <i>in Southern accent ):
How come it takes</i>

more than one squirrel
to screw in a lightbulb?

ALL:
Because they're so darn stupid!

( <i>laughs )</i>

My people!

But, seriously, folks,
I want to give

a special thanks
to my friend Sandy.

Sandy, don't you see?

The crowd loves these jokes.

Am I right?

( <i>laughing )</i>

Don't you see, Sandy?

We're laughing <i>with
you, not at you.</i>

Do you understand now, Sandy?

Huh? Do you?

l understand exactly
what's going on, SpongeBob.

Great.

I knew sooner or later,
you'd understand.

What a great sport.

Let's give a big hand
to Sandy!

But clap slow, because remember,
she's a squirrel!

( <i>crowd cheers )</i>

Thank you.

You've been a wonderful audience
and, uh, good night.

Ah... another spectacular
performance, SpongeBob.

Oh, what's this, a fan letter?

You did it, SpongeBob.

You get to keep your career
and your friends.

( <i>sniffing )</i>

I'm glad that Sandy can finally
see the genius of my comedy.

Good morning, Sandy.

( <i>in Southern accent ):
Well, how-dee!</i>

Sandy, are you
feeling all right?

l'm just being
my au-naturally squirrely self.

Well, come on in.

Y'all must be tired

from telling them
funny jokes all the time.

Why don't you take a load off?

Uh, Sandy, I think something's
wrong with this seat.

Naw, I just done put glue on it
so you wouldn't fall off.

( <i>gasps )</i>

Are them flowers for me?

You even done got me a vase.

But Sandy, that...
that's not a...

( <i>guffaws )</i>

Ain't that purdy?

Sandy, I need wa...

Oh, that's right.

You's a sea critter.

Now, what was that thing
sea critters need?

Um... uh, let's see...
sea critters need, uh...

Wa...

Oh, wait!
Don't tell me.

I know this one.

Wa...

Wa... llet?
Watch? Waffles?

( <i>hoarsely ):
Sandy!</i>

Water!

Well, why didn't you
just say so?

Here you go.

Yup, us squirrels
sure is stupid.

( <i>gurgling ): Sandy!
Dumb, dumb, dumb.</i>

Squirrels is dumb.

( <i>gurgling ):
Sandy!</i>

Okay, Sandy, I get it!

What's that?

You want more?

Okey-dokey.

More water for the sea critter.

( <i>gurgling ):
Okay, Sandy, okay!</i>

I get it!

No more squirrel jokes.

CROWD ( <i>chanting ):
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!</i>

SpongeBob! SpongeBob!

Thank you, thank you very much.

Well, on my way over here,
l ran into a squirrel.

And I said, "Hey, why don't you"

"go get a couple
of your squirrel friends

and we'll go change
a lightbulb?"

( <i>cheering wildly )</i>

But seriously, folks, the only
thing dumber than a squirrel

is a sponge!

l mean, we're so dumb,
we don't even have a vertebrae!

( <i>laughs )</i>

Look at me!

I got no bones.

( <i>chuckling )</i>

That's true.

( <i>laughing harder )</i>

SPONGEBOB:
Crabs? Oh, brother.

They're so cheap, they can't
even pay attention!

( <i>chuckling )</i>

It's true!
I am cheap!

Now, let me tell you
about those fish.

Boy, are they smelly.

Whoo-hoo!

How could a creature

who spends so much time
in the water smell so bad?

I mean, really.

( <i>flatly ):
Soap, soap, what is soap?</i>

( <i>uproarious laughter )</i>

( <i>crowd continues cheering
and laughing )</i>

SPONGEBOB:
And don't even get me started
on starfish!
