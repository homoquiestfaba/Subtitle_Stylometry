Woman: My dad would always say,
"Never sell out.

Always put love first.

And if all else fails,
there's always Woodstock."

(alarm clock buzzing )

-( buzzing stops )
Oh, God.

Oh, God.

(cries ) Oh, God.
Did you come?

-( Sobbing ) Oh, God.
Oh...

Oh, God.

I'm sorry.
It's okay.

I just always want to
feel so close to you

but I'm really not.

Hmm...

Like you love me and...

like you're listening to me...

and listening to my bo-- my body.
Mm-hmm.

I feel like I'm hurting you,

but you're just letting me
hurt you,

( sobbing )
and it's so so sweet!

It's so nice!

I don't want to hurt you,
though.

I mean, I also do, you know?

Yeah, I know.

â™ª I pray for sound...â™ª

Woman: Ever feel like you're
staring at the life you want...

but from too far away
to actually live it,

like you're the plagiarized
version of yourself?

My parents died too early
for me to know them.

It's not as tragic as it sounds.
I was fine.

I am... fine.

Why did that war have no heroes?

Because we were too wild and jovial
to know the brutal truths of the fight.

Woman: That is my fiancÃ©,
Garret Brener.

He is an actor.
He is really good.

He told me himself.
-( clears throat)

I work here,
Abundant Records,

where every song sounds better
with a beat.

If you're signed here,
you have a real shot at making it,

a shot at being her,
Jody Sinclair.

My best friend Ryan
is the PR brains behind

the highly grossing
Jody brand.

She got me this gig to get my foot
in the proverbial music door.

She knows how
to handle talent.

And this is me,
Catherine Brown.

The real me is a songwriter.

The real me
is signed at Abundant Records.

The real me wouldn't be
planning a wedding

because she hates weddings,

and anyone who takes them
seriously

is a ridiculous person,
but this me,

the me that is actually
living my life...

-( alarm clock buzzing)
Oh, no, it's so good.

This me is stuck--

stuck at home,
stuck at work...

and stuck with this damn song.

( No voice,
pounding heartbeat)

Oh, yeah.
Lately, I've been doing that.

I don't really know why.
I think it makes me feel better.

Hey, at least I'm not a cutter.

(alarm clock buzzes)

Oh, shit!

Garrett, I am late,

and I molested that little marble man
for a full minute.

That marble man is a De Fontana.
It's worth a fortune.

Oh, God,
my eyes are so blue.

You want to do lunch at noon?

My Eyes...

Uh, no, I can't.
I can't today.

Sorry, babe, therapist.

On a Monday?

Uh-huh.
Twice a week, digging deep.

Have a good morning, Pete.

Thank you, Cath.
You're the best.

Alex Calucas
wants to see you upstairs.

Thanks, Sally.

Turner, hey, um, Turner,

do you know why they want
to see me upstairs?

No, no clue.

Well, how was the shoot?
Flipped her shit.

And then she threw
a muffin at Ryan.

What the hell?
What a crazy ass.

And you know how
I feel about carbs.

Okay, she is only
in town for two more days,

just... breathe.

The little bitch
doesn't even sing...

Well, yeah, she spins.

Picks a song
and presses play.

And that wins you a Grammy?
What can you do?

People are into post-Internet
scene kids and robot dub-step.

Why does Alex
want to see me upstairs?

Maybe they finally listened
to your demo.

Right.
Makin' big money.

Absolutely.

Caitlin!
-( whispers ) Catherine.

Catherine, come on in.
Come on in.

Please, have a seat.

We have some
exciting news for you.

Important and exciting.

You are about to win at life.

You're gonna be a life winner.
Listen...

we would like for you
to shadow Jody Sinclair.

You're gonna be
her new wrangler.

Wrangler.

Are you excited?
You excited?

Yeah!
I told you. Great.

See, I love her.

Great.
All right, thank you.

Okay. bye-bye-

Um, sorry, um...

what do you mean by wrangle?

Woman:
I can't go out there.

Woman: One minute.
-( cigarette lighter flicks)

Do you want to talk about it?

How can we talk about the pain
that's in the world right now?

You know, like,
it's just so much.

Sometimes you just don't
know what to do,

and when there's that much pain,
it really gives no meaning

to me spinning
my amazing records.

Yeah.
And I'm really good.

And I wish I could help them.

Let me help you out.

Here we go.
It's gonna be okay.

No...
Yeah, well,

I don't want to go.
Oh, you're not going, okay.

Oh, I'm gonna get you
on the floor then.

Let's just get on the stage
and then we can keep--

. Drag me gently.
Okay.

This is a vintage McQueen.

I'm sorry
if it's gonna get torn.

I don't really want to mess up
your clothes.

Oh, I'm sorry.
This is... kind of romantic.


Catherine:
My dad produced that album

and my mother sang
some of the vocals.

I walk by this store front
every day,

and I think about that drive
and that Woodstock house,

and the box
with my mom's wedding dress...

and my dad's lucky quill
that I buried

under the fourth tree
from the porch.

( Sniffles )

Can you believe this?

Thank you.

Catherine.
Sally.

They want to see you
upstairs again.

Oh, probably getting a bonus.

Fired?!

We never said
to physically assault her.

Yeah, "wrangle" wasn't literal.

I was pulling, not assaulting,
pulling.

Pulling, assaulting,
who knows the difference?

She felt violated.

She said it was either you
or her.

Yeah, and we chose her,
obviously.

Wait, I got her there
just like you said.

Alex: Your actions jeopardized
the biggest client

we have at this label.

Your bad decisions
almost made me almost fire Ron.

What?

It's clear-your-desk time,
Catherine.

I want to thank you
for this opportunity

and let you know
that I have a bruise on my hip

because of
last night's assignment,

and I was the one assaulted,

and I was the one abused,
but I will be fine,

because that is just what I do

when things are not... fine.

I just- I... make them fine.

Were you...
were you really going to fire me?

No.
Yeah.


(shower running )

( gasps )
( telephone ringing )

Garret?

. Baby, the way
you look at me...

Hey.

Catherine... um--

Bonjour.

Bonjour? Wh..

This is--
this is not what it looks like.

Yeah?
I know it looks really bad,

and it's a version of what
it looks like, but it's not this.

It's much more innocent than--
Therapist, Garret?

Well, I should have known
that "digging deep" was literal.

Uh, this is Sylvia.
She's my-- she's my dialect coach.

And she-- she was helping me
with some vowel sounds

the director said
that I needed help on.

Vowel sounds?
Okay, Catherine,

just listen to me
for one second.

(sighs ) She showed me
a scar that she has on her leg

from a horseback riding accident
when she was five,

and she said it makes her
feel ugly,

and so all I was trying to do
is convince this broken girl

that she was okay.

What am I supposed to do?

Anyway, the point is
I don't know how I got here.

I really don't know I got here.
Why are you here?

Why aren't you at work?

I...

was...

fired!

Ooh! God!

Oh, she got me right...

(slow R&B playing )

â™ª Baby, when you touch me â™ª

â™ª Ooh, ooh, ooh â™ª

â™ª I lose all sense of timeâ™ª

â™ª Is he dead, is it love?â™ª

â™ª Taste your lips upon me, girlâ™ª

â™ª Ooh, ooh, ooh...â™ª

-( pounding heartbeat)
â™ª Feel your skin next to mi--â™ª

( Strangled breath )

Really,
this song is about um--

it's about this-- the monster

that was living
under my bed as a child.

Man: You're joking.

No, I'm not--
I'm not joking.

What?

Jody: He was my mate,
but I also feared him.

This song is like a love song,
but, like, also like a dream

of somebody
in a mental institution.

Is anybody
watching this disaster?

Man: What would you like to say
to your fans?

I don't really like
to call them my fans.

I want to call them my friends.

I hate you.

We're all one,
but I would die without them.

You should be dead.

Yeah, it's ironic, you know,
that's why I do what I do.

Cath?
Yo.

I'm not-- I'm not just a deejay.
I'm a rhythm poet.

Hey!
No, I was watching that.

You look crazy, right now.
You are a crazy lady.

That's it.

One week is enough time
to mope around.

Up we go.
No.

We're going out, yes.
Come.

Dr. Phil said I'm a codependent.

Okay, first of all,
never trust a bald man.

I learned that the hard way,
and second of all,

psychology is like the horoscope.

We're going out.

I am never going near
a man again, not even a...

I will not be a codependent
astrologer!

That's fine.
Okay, now wash your face.

(groans ) Fine!

Oh, my God.
You are so fun.

Garret, ugh, he was not fun.

He was one of those artistic types--
super needy and blah.

Ugh.
Who's Garret?

I don't know.
( laughs )

. Hey-
. Hey-

Hi.
Hi.

I'm Ryan.
This is Ryan.

It's nice to meet you.

Yeah, we have to go,
like, right now.

Why? No, I'm having fun.
Hi.

It's good to
see that you're alive.

What's up?
Not much.

Hello, Ryan.
Don't speak to us.

I'm gonna make an effort
to be nice.

Oh, you know what, Garret,
I'm actually really happy

that you're here
because I wanted to introduce you

to my new man, Dylan.

New man?
What?

Dylan, Garret, Garret, Dylan.

It's-- we can all just--

Are you crazy?!
What the hell, man?!

Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

I was lying, you animal.

I was trying to make you--
Why would you lie to me?

You should not lie to people.
Look what you made me do.

You're an asshole.
Ow, Ryan, real mature.

You need some ice.
Oh, God.

What?

You know what?
I think you're right.

I think maybe we should
have some time apart.

I can't do this right now.
This is crazy.

I can't have this kind of press.
I'm punching people.

Yeah...

Look who's got it together.

I'm moving to Woodstock.

What?

This is the house I grew up in

and this whole time,
I forgot I had this option.

I mean, I haven't been there
in 20 years,

but I do technically
own this place.

Is this about last night?
No.

And what are you gonna
do there alone?

Write music...

and do crafts, which I love.

You're moving
to Woodstock by yourself

to a house you haven't seen
since you were four,

with no one there that you know
so you could write and do crafts.

Yes.

What?

This is a horrible idea.
. Heyâ€œ

Last night was supposed
to be about you getting out

of the house,
getting some fresh air

because you spent a whole week
on that damn couch,

and you looked like this tiny,
little Prozac commercial all curled up.

And we know this about you.

You run from things.

I am not running away
from anything.

I'm running to something.
And I have laundry.

So my dad called this morning,

asked me if I wanted to meet
Shelly again.

Said it's important.
He said it's mature.

He said that she means
everything to him...

and we wonder why I sleep
around so much?

We know this about him, okay?

He doesn't know how to protect
your feelings.

You just have to do it yourself.

You're gonna be fine.

Ooh, I'm gonna be--
mm, ooh, super fine.

Come here.


Let's pawn this bitch
and get me a car.

Catherine: Woodstock, New York,
is exactly one hour, 55 minutes

from the city.

You take
the George Washington Bridge

over the Palisades Parkway,
then west on route 23,

and right onto route 33...

and you're there.

In Woodstock, you can plant
a daisy and out pops a rose.

Even the soil here is creative.

Historically, a town full of legends,

all these romantic nomad people
who were always drawn

to this one town,
this beautiful, creative spot,

this Mecca, and I was going
back there to be an artist,

to become the singer
I'd always hoped to be.

Back to this rich,
powerful, creative Mecca.

-( Mouse squeaks)
( screams )

Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Ew! Ew! Ew!

Very good, thank you.

( Blues music playing )

Hi, a white wine, please.

Vodka?

Thank you.

(coughing )

Um, another.
( clears throat)

Okay.

Okay, thank you.

Uh, one more, please.

Seriously?
Yeah, seriously, and a beer.

You know, I should be--

I should be feeling
good right now.

I'm, like, good after this, right?

â™ª We are youngâ™ª

â™ª Heartache to heartacheâ™ª

â™ª We stand â™ª

â™ª No promises,
no demands â™ª

â™ª Love is a battlefield â™ª

â™ª We are strong â™ª

â™ª No one can tell us
we're wrongâ™ª

â™ª Searching our hearts
for some lo-o-o-veâ™ª

â™ª Both of us knowing â™ª

â™ª Love is a battlefield. .â™ª

-( Music stops )
-( panting )


Man:
Got to give her credit.

( Blues music plays)

Hey, you didn't pay!

Emily, I got her, okay?

Hey.

Hi.

I lost my stud.

I can't find it,
and Garret gave me those.

Look.

Here it is.

That's so-
how did you find that?

That is so-- it's the tiniest thing
that's ever existed.

You've got to have--

you've got to have binoculars
for eyeballs.

I'm sorry.
I don't normally karaoke.

Um.
I just got lost in the song.

You were...

fine.

I can't believe
that you found that.

Oh, the light just hit
it perfectly.

It lit up at me.

I'm a professional.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Some things
are hard to ignore.

I love you.

(car alarm wails)

(car alarm chirps)

Oh.

God. ( groans)

I got to stand up.

Is everything moving?

Hey, are you okay?
Mm-hmm.

-( Crash )
-( Catherine yelps)

( groans )
Woodstock Clinic, Susie speaking.

Oh, hi, Mrs. Colson.

( Chatter continues )

What?

Ryan: Do you know
where Catherine Brown is?

Ha, so this is your
version of super fine?

Really?
What happened?

I don't know.
You tell me.

I was the last person
on your call list.


The last thing I remember
was losing my earring.

I guess I found it.
-( knock on door)

Catherine, I see you're awake.
How you feeling?

I'll take the silence
and blinking as "better."

Any shortness of breath?

Headache, nausea?

No and no.

All right, well,
this has been a great talk.

Try to stay hydrated.
Call if you need anything.

What have you got?

Oh, my God. No.

You cannot like him.
No, I know him.

Oh-- oh, God.

Oh, no.

Home, home,
please get me home.



Catherine:
What do I do?

Well, got a weekend
and a credit card.

(dance music plays)

â™ª Yeah, ha, ha, ha â™ª

â™ª Send in the cavalry â™ª

â™ª Travel round the world
and I've searching for a place â™ª

â™ª With something new â™ª

â™ª You only get one shot â™ª

â™ª You've got to give it
everything you got â™ª

â™ª You've come a long way, baby â™ª

â™ª When I will fallâ™ª

â™ª You catch me when I goâ™ª

â™ª You're much closer
than you know...â™ª

(Catherine laughs)
We're such good dancers.

Books on friendship should be
written about people like you.

I love you.
I love you, too.

Okay, mwah.
Mwah.

Hey, Cat!

You came here to write,
so just start writing.

<i>I'</i>

(thunder rumbling)

( kettle whistling )

( humming )

(door slams shut)

(thudding and pounding)

-( wind whistling)
-( wood creaking )


<i>â™ª</i>

( humming )

Are you artichoking?

'Cause there's a doctor
in the house.

Hi.
Hi.

You. Doctor.

I don't love you.
What?

Oh... uh.
I said that at the bar,

and I don't--
I didn't mean it.

I don't say things like that,
and I don't dance like that.

I never dance like that.

So I'm sorry for the awkward
"I love you," yeah.

And I got to go to this thing
that I have.

So I'm gonna go to this thing.

Okay.

Catherine, wait up.

Go to dinner with me?

Like on a date?
Yeah.

Are you insane?

Because I'm acting like--
never mind.

Look, Doctor--
Please call me Noah.

I, uh, technically
would never ask a patient out

so every time you call me "doctor,"
I can't help but feel a little pervy.

Okay, Noah, I'm on
a little thing called the rebound.

I'll tie you up
if you're into that.

What?
What?

I'm sorry, that was bad...
bad joke.

Yeah.

All right, I'm gonna go.
Okay.

Catherine!

It was really great talking to you.

You too.

( Humming )

<i>â™ª</i>

Focus.

(soft rock playing on radio)

(door bell rings)

Um, hi, could I get a large coffee
with some ice in it, please?

You mean, an ice coffee?

No, like a hot coffee
but just with ice in it.

I just like to drink it
right away.

$2.

Thanks.

Hey, you're the bartender
from the other night, right?

Yep.
Yeah, I think I owe you money.

Noah took care of it.

Oh.

So when's the next show?
Most weekends.

But Lee Ann doesn't play here
anymore.

Why not?

Well, she doesn't perform anymore.
Oh.

Oh, oh, sorry.
That's yours.

-( Rock music playing on radio)
-( cigarette lighter flicks)

Last time I'm scraping this off, Emily.
I'm warning you.

Find another window.

I've no idea what you're
talking about, Mr. Harmon.

I'd put that on my wall.

It's really good.

Whoever did that is,
like, brilliant good.

You should come to the barn
tomorrow night.

Hmm?

Just up the creek about
a half-mile down from the race track.

Everybody's gonna be
at the farm.

Aaron Embry's playing.

Bye, Mr. Harmon.

( Indistinct conversations )

Hey.

Hi.

This place is amazing.

It's starting.
Oh.

â™ª Every part of you
is just another part of meâ™ª

â™ª Every part of you
is just another part of meâ™ª

â™ª Every part of you

â™ª Every part of you

â™ª Every part of you

â™ª Every part of you

â™ª Every part of you

â™ª You'll notice every part of you

( band vocalizing )

(crowd cheering )

â™ª Every part of youâ™ª

â™ª Every part of you
is just another part of me. .â™ª

(cheers and applause)

I really needed that.

So I think everybody's gonna go
to Noah's after for dinner.

Do you want to come?
To Noah's?

He owns the barn.

Linda Carr owns the barn.
That was his mom.

No way.

Mm-hmm.
Linda Carr Bernstein.

She died a couple
of years ago.

I think it's pretty cool
that he kept this place going.

So you coming?

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

You need help down there?

Man:
Who need some more wine?

A little bit more of the red.

( Rock music playing on radio)

Who listens
to the radio anymore?

93.3 is part of the perks
of living in Woodstock.

And I love the radio.

Remember the days when you had
to wait for a good song?

Instant gratification
is the tagline of our generation.

So I get you.

They play all the local bands
and new stuff

people are still working on,
which is cool to hear.

It's the reason
why I listen to music.

I always have it on at my office.
It's just the best.

So, Catherine,
what brought you up here?

Um... well, I own a house here,
and I haven't been back

in years and years.

Just thought I'd take a break
and do some writing.

You're a writer?

Yes, singer--
well songwriter/singer-

so, whatever, yes, I'm a writer.

Cool, what kind of stuff
do you write?

I guess you could say
that it is in the folk family.

It's a good family to be in.
Yeah.

Why don't you play something?
Uh...

Oh, come on, play something.
No... no, it's okay.

This is a great audience.

Ah, yeah, I can tell--
well, actually,

I did just finish one song
that I can play, but...

Man:
So there we go.

Emily: Come on.
Man: Yeah!

Do it.
Let's hear it.

<i>. No .</i>

â™ª I really don't think so,
oh, oh, ohâ™ª

â™ª Did you think I'd be incapable
of being on my own?â™ª

<i>â™ª Noâ™ª</i>

â™ª I really don't think so,
oh, oh, ohâ™ª

â™ª That I would for a second
let you back in through my doorâ™ª

â™ª I have spent many a night
even whenâ™ª

â™ª I was by your side
I shed tears I couldn't cryâ™ª

â™ª I shed tears I couldn't dryâ™ª

â™ªfor taking my blindfold offâ™ª

â™ª Now I ain't jaded no more,
no moreâ™ª

â™ª And I take pride in being
the one that said good-byeâ™ª

â™ª That could only mean
lam me once moreâ™ª

â™ªThat can only mean
lam me once more. .â™ª

( Applause )

Man:
That sounded great.

Woman:
Let's hear another one.

Why haven't you ever
come back?

Oh... just, uh, you know
never got around to it.

It wasn't on the old agenda.

Also my p-- my parents died
when I was little here,

so, uh, I guess it kind of...
brought back some memories.

Um, where's the--
where's the bathroom?

Is that on the--
in the veranda?

Okay, I'm gonna run
to the bathroom.

Bobby Charles.

"I Must Be in a Good
Place Now."

I used to hear this song
all the time when I was a kid.

I'd sit under the table
in the kitchen

and watch their bare feet
swaying around.

They'd pretend not to know
I was down there.

"I wonder if Catherine
is sleeping tight?"

Jackie De Shannon.

Oh, "The Weight."

This must be the best song
ever written.

<i>I'</i>

Like, it must be.

The first night we met
when I brought you to my office...

I watched you sleep
the whole night.

Well, that's borderline creepy.

And I thought...

this is the most beautiful
person ever made.

I should go.

Yeah.

Thank you.

I never got a chance to
thank you for last week, so...

thank you,
and for the compliment.

I don't think I've ever gotten
a compliment like that.

<i>I'</i>

(door bell rings)

Um, is Emily here?

Uh, no...
Okay.

You're Lee Ann Frank, right?

That would be me.
I'm a huge fan.

Oh, thank you, honey.

Can I get you something?

Yeah, a coffee would be great.

Yeah, it's a cold night.
It's freezing.

I don't know
how you guys do it.

Oh, that's the best part--

the weather
these mountains make.

Are you just visiting
Woodstock?

Actually, I moved back here,
I guess.

Oh... that's great.

Where to?

The Brown house
on Gray street.

It's right next to
the Gilard farm.

Yeah, I didn't know
that house sold.

Oh, it's mine,
or it was my parents'.

Uh, so what do I owe you?

On me.
You sure?

Welcome back.

Oh, hey, uh, I didn't catch
your name.

Catherine.
Catherine Brown.

Yes, well, welcome back
to Woodstock, Catherine Brown.

Thanks.

And it was really special
to meet you.

( Sighs. scoffs )

<i> â€œBah: Hey!
wens y</i>

Oh, God, you scared me.
Sorry, your coffee.

Sorry. Hi.

Are you that way?
Yeah, I'm on Gray Road.

That's close to me.
I'll walk with you.

Okay... yeah, yeah.

(laughing ) Ryan and I
are just covered in red wine.

And we're just laughing so hard,
and we're so scared

that the headmaster"; gonna
come find us.

Nice.

And so Ryan looks at me
and she goes,

"Hey, do you know
the one with two sailors

who go out to sea
and get covered in red wine?"

I knew that one.

And we figured out
that we could laugh

at the same things,

and so she's-- she's family.

And you've no other family?

Not-- not anyone
close enough to count.

And Ryan got you
the job at Abundant?

Is this gonna be
a one-way street the whole way?

'Cause I feel like
I'm talking too much.

I like it.

I also like it.

Catherine:
You're with who?

Catherine:
You're with who?

I know, it's kind of crazy.

Yeah, pretty crazy.

We just made love
to your song.

Oh. That's... special.

It was amazing,
and your song was amazing.

( Mouths words )

Say thank you.
It was a compliment.

Thank you.

Hey, Ryan, Ryan.
What are you doing?

I'm getting ready.
It's Jody's press junket tonight.

Jody... Sinclair?

Why are you working with her?

Oh...

I have my reasons.

Trust me.
I have my reasons.

Catherine's voice:
. No, I really don't think so...

It feels good, man.

I'm feeling it.
Ron: Yes, I'm feeling it.

It's like this that hippie hit.
We've hit the nail on the head.

Kudos.
Not you.

Bam, we did good.

Good job.
Good job.

So, uh... so you--

you seeing anyone
at the moment, Ryan?

Can you stop breathing on me?
Thank you.

. Have spent many a night...

Oh, you're closed, sorry.

Oh, hi, Catherine.
You want some coffee?

Oh, no, no.

So what do you do?

Oh, I'm a singer
and a songwriter.

I think.
You think?

Yeah, well, I'll know
when I write something brilliant

and people listen to it.

"Brilliant."
Kind of overrated.

Yeah, I've actually been having
a really hard time writing.

And I'm just
not censoring myself,

and the thing that I really
like about your music

is your lyrics, how sly they are,
how smart they are,

just- the song is so much cooler

than whoever"; listening to it.

It's just totally--
um, it's totally uncensored.

Well, thank you.
That's sweet.

You know my dad used to listen
to your music all the time?

He'd sit out on the front porch
and play your album.

Yeah.

Well, we wrote some songs
together, your dad and I.

You did?
Yes, we did.

I knew there was a reason
I was looking for you.

Well, why don't you come by
one night after we close?

I'll give you some pointers,
help you with those lyrics.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

It's still here.


(door bell rings)

Hey, Mr. Harmon
is gonna kill you.

He'll leave it up eventually.

Mm-hmm.
Yes, he will.

So what happened the other night?
You left so fast.

Nothing.
I mean... nothing at all.

It was really nice.
Noah's, uh... very nice.

Apparently, he's boning
a Namibian model.

So he's that guy.

I just wanted you to know.

Hmm.
I'm just saying you should be careful.

A model?

Noted.

Thank you for playing that.

Oh, sure.

I had to go find it yesterday
after you left.

All right, let me see.

"Follow the River to Me."

It's dumb.
No, no, it's not dumb.

It's just maybe there's something,
you know, more poetic.

Mm-hmm.
I feel like I'm trying too hard.

And working too hard.
Is there such a thing?

In art, yeah.
It's a balance.

You definitely have
to put in the time,

but, you know, then you also
just have to let it flow.

You just have
to be easy with it.

Where would you follow
the river to?

Literally, to the sea.

â™ª Follow the river to the seaâ™ª

â™ª Follow the river to the seaâ™ª

And that's why you're a genius.

Why don't you perform
anymore?

You know, if there's
any advice I can give you,

it's don't love anyone

The barn used to be
my mother's.

I know.
Emily told me.

It's strange to own something
that used to be theirs.

I still feel guilty
about changing the drapes.

Like you'll get in trouble.

This is crazy 'cause it happened
so long ago for me,

but sometimes like it's where
they just went out to a party.

Or the whole day goes by

and I wonder why
my mother hasn't called.

I know, it's weird.
Sometimes more weird than sad.

My friends complain
about their parents,

how they yell at them
or they hate them

for being human and failing.

Yeah.

And they're just lucky.

Lucky ducks.

Hello?
Ron: Morning, Catherine?

Who is this?
It's Ron. How are you?

Oh... Ron, hi.

I'm not calling too early,
am I?

Yeah, no, it's not too early.

Ron: I listened to those tracks
that you told Ryan--

Catherine: You did?

Well, no, I didn't ask Ryan
to do that, but...

Ron:
No, but she sent us them.

Well, yeah,
you called me, though.

Well, I'm not a hustler.

No, that's okay,
that's great.

Like, how many songs?
Ron: It's not a problem, is it?

Um...

Yeah, I think I can do that.
Brilliant.

Um...
By the 24th.

The 24th?

That's--
On the 24th.

That is in a week.
No, I think so.

I think, yeah, I can do that.
I think I can do that.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, that's--
thank you.

( laughs ) I will see you--
I will be there.

Okay. bye-
Okay.

( Clears throat)

lam going to Abundant Records
on the 24th.

I have a 2:00 in the studio.

What?

I don't even know what to say.

Oh, this is crazy.

They want me to prepare
all of my tracks.

I only have--
I have one good one so far.


Would you ever move back
to the city?

Yeah, I mean, for a record deal,
I would do anything.

You are a good luck charm,
Noah Bernstein.

They don't call me
the magic stick for nothing.

( Snickers )
Oh, you did not say that.

Stay.

I can't.

I have to prepare
all these songs

and this week just became
really important--

Come on, I will cancel
my 12:00 at the office,

make you breakfast.

Stay.

Fine... fine.

But you're here now!
-( laughs )

( laughs)

<i>â™ª</i>

. If I'm asleep...

Hi. ( laughs)

I know, I just thought
what's another couple hours?

Hi, surprise.

I just couldn't help myself.

( Squeals )

Okay.

What?

What-- what--

After you, miss.

â™ª Noahâ™ª

â™ª You're an assholeâ™ª

â™ª Noah â™ª

â™ª You're a jerk â™ª

â™ª Noahâ™ª

â™ª I really don't think so,
oh, ohâ™ª

â™ª I think you hate womenâ™ª

â™ª And you are an asshole. .â™ª

Oh, my God.

They all just want to break
our hearts, don't they?

I blame Eve.
That's what it comes down to.

We are being punished
because this selfish naked gal

who just couldn't help herself,

we are left on this planet,
and we're trying to, like,

do what's right by life.

Never give it up, Lee Ann.

Never.

I don't think that's possible,
even if I tried.

Look where we live.

( Both laugh )

You know what?

They only like you
until they get you,

and they're gonna lie,
and they're gonna cheat,

and steal until they get you.

No, nothing is gonna
get me down this time.

Nothing's bringing me down.

Chastity belt
all up in here.

Oh, oh,
I forgot to tell you something.

This is gonna make you
feel so much better.

Have you ever heard of
Billy Todd, Classic Soul Recordings?

It's this awesome, I mean,
awesome little indie label

outside of Nashville,
and Billy's an old friend of mine.

And he is the real-deal
kind of music guy.

I never asked him for anything,
ever, and I called him.

And he is gonna come here
to Woodstock on the 24th

to hear you sing.

I'm telling you,
I just got a feeling

that this is gonna be
the perfect match.

You'll come here after closing
just like you've been doing,

and you will sing
for my friend.

You good?

The 24th?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is that a problem?

No, not.

I will be here.
It's gonna be so great.

Oh, I love this cake.

I know, man,
this is my favorite cake.

(alarm clock buzzes)


Focus, focus, focus.

Whoo.

Think, think.

Think, think.

â™ª If I stop too longâ™ª

â™ª If I stop too long to thinkâ™ª

â™ªNothing good
can come from that â™ª

â™ª You don't have to tell meâ™ª

â™ª That I'm running scared â™ª

â™ª I am fully presentâ™ª

â™ª I am â™ª

â™ª Totally aware â™ª

â™ª Nothing's gonna break
me down â™ª

â™ª And I don't know anymore â™ª

â™ª Than I did way back thenâ™ª

â™ª It's just that I am
done with movingâ™ª

â™ª In the wrong direction â™ª

â™ª Love, I wouldn't change
a thing, you know â™ª

â™ª I never could pretend â™ª

â™ª Nothing's gonna breakâ™ª

â™ª Nothing's gonna
break me do-o-o-wn â™ª

â™ª Nothing's gonna break
me down. .â™ª

That was dope.

Thanks for helping.
Yeah, of course.

I should get going.

He's a weirdo.
Mmm?

You know, I should probably go, too.
Yeah.

You gonna come?

No, I'm gonna wait for Lee Ann.

Have a good night.

You, too.

â™ª Dear fellow traveler
under the moonâ™ª

â™ª I saw you standing
in the shadows â™ª

â™ª And your eyes
would bloomâ™ª

â™ª You put your hand down,
opened the door...â™ª

Hey, Em.
Hey.

Is Catherine here?
Nope.

Actually,
I haven't seen her all day.

Right, the 24th,
she's in the city.

Is she mad at me?
Has she said anything to you?

No.
She's kind of a private person.

I'm sure if she's mad,
you must have done something.

Look, she really likes you.
Don't be a dick.

I'll work on that.

Thanks, I wasn't planning on it,
but thanks for the advice.

One thing I know about men,
you can't help it.

You just sneeze the wrong way,
and you break our hearts.

â™ª Return to my beautiful city â™ª

â™ª Black skies changed into blue...â™ª
-( knock on door)

Ryan?

Ry?

Ryan?

What? I'm not sleeping.

Surprise!
I forgot to call you.

I've noticed.

How very coming of age of you.

I miss you.

I have something incredibly
important to tell you,

like, it is insane.

Can I come by after the meeting?

Yes.
Okay.

Good luck and...

What? Oh...

It never hurts with those two.

Mm, thanks
for the pick-me-up.

Your little hippy polka song
sounded weird at first,

I'm not gonna lie.

That wasn't even finished.
It was a mess.

It sounded like
a Bar Mitzvah video or something.

Yeah, it sounded Jewish.

Yeah, like really,
very Jewish, actually.

But people are into hipsters.

Oh, everyone's
moving to Brooklyn.

We took your song
and pumped it up a little bit,

put a little beat behind it.
and immediately...

I saw fragrance.
Oh, yeah, fragrance.

I saw girls crying
about their boyfriends.

Just crying.

I saw covers of magazines.
Magazines.

You are relatable.
Yeah, and relatable sells.

Do you understand
what we're saying?

I think so.

Catherine, get a lawyer.
We want to sign you.

See, you plus a beat,
it's record gold.

Okay, record gold, baby.

What-- what do you mean
by "plus a beat"?

( Dub-step music playing )

Party over here.

Party over there.

See?
A-mazing, huh?

( Catherine singing indistinctly
behind music )

Just one moment.

( No voice, heartbeat )


( music continues)

I love it.

Let me play you the new stuff.

Catherine, hey, can we talk?

No.
Please, please.

No way, no.
Please just don't walk away.

How did you even know
that I was here?

Sally.

Sally.

It's good to see you.

Can we just go get a glass
of wine and just... please?

Just one little glass.

You know, no.
Just to talk.

You know what,
I have this thing tonight in Woodstock

and I was supposed
to go say hi to Ryan,

and, shit, I don't want
to go back in there.

Listen, look, look at you.

Look how stressed out you are.

Let's just go focus on you
for one night.

Come on.

Oh, God, I real-- I miss this,

like, being open with you

and I'm just being
so open with somebody.

You're not open
with your French girl?

I think I need to go
into treatment, like a rehab.

I-I...

I think I'm a sex addict.

I need to curb this thing in me
that just wants to sabotage things

and have sex with them
and just be gluttonous

'cause I think
have boundary issues,

and I-- I--
I think I-- you know what?

I think I want
to be gluten-free,

and I just want to change
everything about myself

so you won't even recognize me,
and I'll do that today,

I will change everything...
right now.

I mean it.

Where- where's your ring?

I sold it.

You...

Well, I deser-- I deserve that,
but here's the thing, Cat.

Ten years is ten years,

and things were getting weird
between us.

You know, and I messed up.

Everyone messes up.
You make mistakes.

Okay, I made bigger mistakes,
but... Catherine,

you know that we always
come back to each other.

You know we do,

and I have always
been here for you.

I know everything
about everything about you.

Doesn't that mean something?

And I... ( sighs)

I mean, I'm an idiot,
but I'm your idiot.

And your idiots
are hard to come by.

Tell me.

( Vibrates )

Oh, where is my phone?
Come on.

(door bell rings)

Lee Ann, lam so sorry.
I just have a lot going on.

And I was in the city
and Abundant Records

wants to sign me,
but they ruined my song.

Abundant Records?
Garret showed up.

That's where you were?
-( sighs ) It's a long story.

I just- last night
was not working out for me.

That's what I've been helping
you write for,

that horrible sell-out company?

See, this is why
I didn't want to tell you,

because I thought
that you would react like this.

That company is pretty major.

Did you forget how they
fired you without a glance?

They make music
that you hate.

Well, maybe I don't care.

You don't care
about your work?

Yeah, maybe I want to sell out.

Maybe I want to stop trying
so hard.

Honey... you are so much better

than what just came out
of your mouth.

I should just go back to the city.
I don't belong here.

Wherever you go,
you take yourself with you.

You think the gauge
for not trying so hard

is that it feels easy?

Well, you're wrong.

Yeah, says the woman
who won't sing in public anymore

'cause some guy told her that
her voice quivers on the wrong octave.

Oh, yeah.

Right, yeah, you're right.

Who am I to lecture you
on good choices?

For the record...

I went out on the line for you.

You should go back to the city.

You don't belong here.

( Sobbing )

( knocks on door)

( knocks on door)

Catherine.
Hi.

Hi,
I thought you were in Woodstock.

I was.

I just had an awful 24 hours,
and I really do miss something.

I don't know what.
I just- I need a hug.

I don't know if that's right
or whatever, but I just need a hug.

Can you just hug me for like--
Yeah, of course, come here.

Oh, why are you--
why are you greasy?

Oh, I, um... uh, it's...

. I..
Garret?

What?
Why are you greasy?

It's a, uh, it's oil,
and it-- I don't know.

You're supposed to--
it's supposed to like sort of--

no, no,
Catherine, don't go in there!

We were never officially
back together.

Oh, come on!

Um, you remember.
This is Sylvia.

And this is her very
close friend, Matilde.

Sorry, can you leave us alone
for a second?

Catherine,
it's all out of con--

Don't you dare.
Give it to me.

I implore you to hand me
that marble man statue

because it's a De Fontana,
and it's insanely expensive.

Don't, don't, please, please.
please, please, please, please.

It's my lucky charm.
Going down.

And every part I get,
I rub him on top of his head!

Please, don't! No!

No?
Okay, Catherine, Catherine.

Good, you...
keep control, okay?

Let's just be reasonable here,
all right.

What are you doing?
No, no, no!

Don't, don't--
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

You chopped
his little penis off?

Yeah, it's called retribution,
Garret.

You chopped
his little penis off.

Just be happy
I wasn't being literal.

Ryan:
"Very good friend"?

Yes, and the whole place
is just covered in, like, baby oil,

and Noah is with this tall,
Namibian lady

and Lee Ann is...

You know what, Catherine?
I can't be here for you right now.

Why not?

Do you know that I called you
seven times last week

and then waited for four hours
for you to stop by after your meeting?

I was having one of the most
important weeks of my life.

Yeah, well, so was I.

Oh, right, right,

because the world cannot
revolve around me for just a second.

What?
Are you a mental?

The world's axis
sits on your tiny, little person

and spins out of control
and all I do is clean up your mess,

your constant emotional mess.

Oh, wow, whoa, what a joke!

I am an emotional mess?

You're obsessive
and sleep around so much,

I have lost penis count.

You know what?

I don't give a shit
what you think about me.

I am no mental
when lam standing across

from the single most insane,
wildly inappropriate,

just downright wrong person
I've ever met.

I'm pregnant.

Of course you are.

Get out.
Great.

And I hate your baby.


( grunts ) Don't-- ow...

Ow, stop, stop.
Stop.

(groans ) Ow!

Jesus, dude,
I thought you were dead.

I mean, you look all cracked out
and dead right now.

I feel like a version of that.

What the hell happened to you?

Um... I failed at life.
Everybody hates me.

I'm about to sell out
to Abundant tomorrow.

Catherine?

I'm dying.

What?

I mean, I'm not really dying,

but it kinds of puts shit
into perspective, doesn't it?

Plus you'd feel
like an asshole if I was.

Somebody should definitely
feel like an asshole right now.

Look, dude, what do you want?

If you could want anything
and it didn't matter,

what would you want?

To make the record
I wrote out here.

But how it sounds,
you know, not like--

and I don't care who puts it out,

who it's through,
I just want it to sound like

how it sounds here, like--
( stammers )

I want it to sound like me.

Good.
Let's record it.

Tell Abundant to take
it or leave it.

(laughs )Yeah.
My meeting's tomorrow.

Where would we even record it?

No.

No.

Will you be
my emergency contact?

Thank you.

You can step right in,

just leave the paperwork
on the desk.

Yeah.

Hey, doc, I got this.

What are you doing here?

We wanted to, um, well--

We need to use
the studio at the barn.

That's why you're here?
Yep.

Also if you don't mind,
cancerous?

You're fine, but you should
be seeing the dermatologist

at least once a year.

-( Whispers ) What was that?
I don't have cancer.

No, I know,
but, for him to walk out.

I found the cold-hearted-snake
tone of voice a real doozy.

Should we leave?

You can go.

I set it up.

No.

No, he cannot just...

Hey!
Excuse me?

What are you doing?

No, Noah, no.
You do not get to snub me.

Do you understand that?

You are not allowed
to be cold to me,

when I should be cold to you.

You slept with me,
and it was--( Catherine sighs )

I mean, it was the be--
it was ama-

four times!

Okay, no, that's not the point.

The point is-- the point--
the point is this--

Catherine, what is your point?

I can't remember!

Okay, I saw you kiss Garret.

I drove to the city,
like an idiot, to see you.

I stood outside of that building
for an hour

and you walked
into someone else's arms.

Okay, and I was hurt.

Understandable.

You know what?
I know what you are.

You are a player.

What the fuck?!

Whoa, whoa, whoa--
I'm sorry, Mr. Harmon,

but this little liar man here
has this tall Namibian girlfriend

that he is hiding away
somewhere.

He's just storing her,
and you know what?

I came to see you, too.

After I left your house I drove
to your office to surprise you,

and I see you walk out
with legs-for-days over there.

So you didn't warn me about you,
but you should have.

Laura?

Laura is the new physician assistant
at my office.

Catherine, I have been single
since my mom died.

You know what?
Catherine, you should go.

You should go.

But I-I never slept with him,
no, I didn't.

He kissed me and then
I slept over at his house,

but that was later,
hours and hours later,

and we did sleep in the same bed,
but that was it.

I couldn't do it,

and I thought that you
were ditching me.

You are the one that I want
to have sex with, not Garret,

just you, Noah,
like, I want to have sex forever.

I want have forever
sex with you.

( Clears throat)

Thanks for the studio.
Mm.

Hey.

I'm so sorry.

I'm really sorry for what I said.

It wasn't your most
tactful moment.

But there was
some truth in all that.

There was.

Thank you for helping me,

for being so generous,
for showing me how to write

and showing me how--
just...

what I was looking
for when I came here.

I think you're doing
the right thing today.

You do?
'Cause it sounds like you.

As long as you're being honest,
then it doesn't matter who puts it out.

I'm proud of you.

I think your dad would be, too.
Come on.

Can I come in?

I'm so sorry.

That was our first fight.
I know.

Unless you count the time
you slapped me after prom.

Blake Rutherford? No.

That was like
a "slap back to reality" slap,

so it doesn't count.

I don't hate your baby.

You don't?
No.

I love your baby.
It's gonna be the cutest.

Oh, look at us...

just a couple of grown-ups

having babies.

Come here.

I miss you.
I miss you, too.

And I'm hungry.
I'm always hungry.

Catherine's voice:
. And I don't know...

Let me think about it.
No.

No.

â™ª Way back then...â™ª

I understand.

â™ª I am done with moving â™ª

â™ª The wrong direction â™ª

â™ª You don't have to tell me â™ª

â™ª You don't have to tell meâ™ª

â™ª How it's gonna end...â™ª

Man on radio:
All day love songs coming right up.

We want to hear
your stories, folks,

as we jam out these love songs
all day long.

But they can only be told
if you call in,

so give us a call--
SSS-ROCK.

Hey, there, our first caller.

What's your name?

Hello?
Hello, there.

Yeah, um...
uh, this is Catherine.

And you have a love story
for us, Catherine?

Yes, I do.

Um... but you know,

um, it's more than that.

It's, um--
it's-- it's kind of about...

um, music and Woodstock

and growth and then love.

Love is kind of the cherry
on top of my story.

Man: Okay.

Catherine: I-- I think that I may
have pushed away

the only guy that I've ever...

loved...

the only guy who's ever made
just complete and total sense

and, um...

and my dad used to say
that love--

forever love was just all resistance
and pain at the beginning,

and I think that
we got through that, so we're good,

and he might be listening
to you right now.

( Catherine exhales sharply)

And if he is,
I just want him to know

that he feels like family to me and--
( whimpers )

we both don't have any, so...

Uh, I'm on my way home,
and if he could just forgive me

or chalk it up to...
I don't know, rough beginnings,

I would just be the happiest,
most in-love lady

from, I don't know,
Kingston to Woodstock.

Just setting it all up
so it comes to me if it wants to...

if he wants to.

And that's my story.

( Horn honks )

(car approaching)

You acted crazy at my office.

Mr. Harmon got an earful.

I think he's still recovering.
I'm serious, Catherine.

After you left he complained
about heart palpitations

and told me about his first time.
Her name was Leslie.

She was blonde and plump
and had perfect lady parts.

I'm sorry.

So you're staying here, huh?

I remembered the point.

Oh, yeah?

Love is a battlefield.

That's your point?
Yeah.

That's your great,
big, epic point?

Look, can you just tell me
if you love me or not?

I know that's a lot to ask
of somebody.

I know that's a lot to ask
someone to be that clear,

but I just really need to know
the ending to this part of my story.

Are you kidding me?

I fucking love the shit out of you.

Forever sex time?

( laughs )
You're a serious perv.

(alarm clock buzzing )

Catherine: That's Noah Bernstein,
my husband.

He's a doctor.
He's really good.

And that's me, Catherine Brown,
the new me,

lives in Woodstock, New York.

The new me is signed
to a small Indie label

because she hates
the corporate music biz

and thinks that anyone
who takes it seriously

is a ridiculous person.

But this me...

This is so much more
than I could have hoped for.

The me that's finally living her life,

remembers what her dad
would always say,

"Never sell out.
Always put love first.

And if all else fails,
there's always Woodstock."

â™ª They're coming over on the windâ™ª

â™ª They're coming over
playing horns and violins â™ª

â™ª The saints and sinners
are all marching back inâ™ª

â™ª To lead me on â™ª

â™ª Lead me on â™ª

â™ª I've been walking round
in a haze â™ª

â™ª I have wasted all my nights
and all my daysâ™ª

â™ª I've been lying to myselfâ™ª

â™ª I've been trying to be
someone elseâ™ª

â™ª It's so simple nowâ™ª

â™ª It's no secret howâ™ª

â™ª Follow the river â™ª

â™ª Down to the sea â™ª

â™ª Where you're supposed to beâ™ª

â™ª It's never easyâ™ª

â™ª That's a fact â™ª

â™ª Nothing's for certain â™ª

â™ª You can't always take it back â™ª

â™ª On this sad romantic planet â™ª

â™ª You might make a pact â™ª

â™ª A promise to loveâ™ª

â™ª A promise to love â™ª

â™ª But you've got to learn
to love yourselfâ™ª

â™ª Then you can try to love
somebody e-e-e-lseâ™ª

â™ª I've been trying â™ª

â™ª But it's hardâ™ª

â™ª I've been playing
with some shaky cards â™ª

â™ª But it's so simple now â™ª

â™ª Once someone shows you how â™ª

â™ª I follow the riverâ™ª

â™ª Down to the seaâ™ª

â™ª To where
you're supposed to beâ™ª

â™ª Yeah, I follow the river â™ª

â™ª Follow the river â™ª

â™ª Back down to the seaâ™ª

â™ª That's where
you're supposed to be. .â™ª

(cheers and applause)
