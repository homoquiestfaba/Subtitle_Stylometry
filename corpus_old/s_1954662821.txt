Alice!

Where the hell are you Alice!?

Alice!

Alice where the hell are you?

I'm coming!

Oh, dear god.

Alice!

Where the hell are you, Alice?

Why don't you make yourself
useful and clean me up?

What are you doing?

I said what are you doing?

Alice?

Alice?

Alice please...

Mama!

Mom!

Honey, honey, honey?

Mommy, why did the boy come?

Oh no, it's just
a bad dream, honey,

it's just a bad dream.

Shh.

Hey guys.

Hey.

Hi.

Thank you.

God, is this old or something?

It tastes like shit.

How do you know
what shit tastes like?

Morgan...

Thank you doll, I
appreciate that.

Sorry it just tastes
like crap to me.

Oh well, got to go.

Bye hun.

Bye sweetie.

Bye.

Love you, my princess.

I wish she liked us more.

Aw baby, she loves
you more than anything.

That's so stupid, so typical,

I mean what else are
you supposed to say?

I wish we could have
one morning in this house,

one breakfast without you guys

bickering, bickering, bickering,

always got to complain
about something.

Mama's not perfect,
mama's not perfect.

Guess what?

You're not perfect either.

High-class chef
cuisine people on a budget.

Want to go through
some of the selections?

I sure do.
- Great.

We have raisin
remoulade, spicy sushi.

Parisian pate,
and truffle tacos.

Truffle tacos, which is
what we actually made here,

it's prepackaged, you
just add meat, water,

put it in the
microwave, and uh...

Voila!

We're going to pass it around,

everyone will get
a chance to try it.

Mom!

Mommy!

Hey, what's up, baby?

Oh, I don't feel so good.

Oh boy.

Hey baby give
me your forehead.

You're warm!

Here, lie down for me.

Hey, you sexy thing.

It's Wednesday.

I'm so tired though.

I'm sorry I just didn't
realize, and I put

my thing in already.

Okie dokie.

I'm sorry, I know it matters.

It's OK baby, I don't care.

Mama, mommy!

What's wrong, what's happened?

What's wrong?

I had a bad dream.

Aw, honey, about what?

A bad boy.

It's OK, just a bad dream.

I'll sleep with you, OK?

All right?

Come on.

Oh, my sweetheart,
it's going to be OK.

And I'll see you
next Tuesday at four.

It's going to be fine
bud, you'll get through.

Thanks for stopping in.

Look who's here, hey baby.

That was my last client
of the day, I am free!

Ah.

So...

You got some time, right?

Sure, I'm done today.

I have a secret.

OK, tell me!

I'm having a baby.

No, really.

Oh my god...

Let's go tell the kids.

Give me a kiss.

Let me grab my coat.

Why are you wearing those for?

We gave her night
vision goggles

so now she can see and
I can get some sleep.

That's a great idea!

Good plan, Morgan!

Come here, baby.

I love you.

Goodnight.

You smart little man.

Hey, kisses girly!

I love you babe.

I love you.

Oh, have sweet
dreams, buddy boy.

OK goodnight.

See you in the morning.

Wait, you're going to work?

Silly, the
baby's the size of a peanut.

Yeah, I go to work.

What are we going
to name the baby?

See, I told you, I'm
getting a baby brother!

I have no idea if
it's a boy or a girl

or anything like
that, but I do know

that we should
name it Wednesday.

But you'll stop work
when the baby comes, right?

How long until the baby comes?

Only 6 months!

And yeah, I'm probably going
to stop for a little bit,

just like I did
with you and Ariel.

Why don't you just
keep having babies?

Then you don't have to work!

It kind of doesn't
work that way.

That's a plan.

We'd end up
homeless or something.

This lady on TV,
she has like 20 kids,

and she gets paid
to have a TV show

with her husband, her
and all of her 20 kids.

I've seen that show.

You don't have to
have a lot of kids,

to live a different kind
of a life, you know?

Well, right now,
I've got to go to work.

And I will see you
as soon as I can.

You have a good day.

You too, hun.

Bye guys!

Well I'm sorry,
but there's nothing

obviously wrong with Sophia.

There's isn't any evidence
of a stroke or anything.

I think we ought to
take her into the city

to the hospital to
have some tests done.

What happened just before
she started screaming?

Nothing.

Nothing really happened.

Well your mother's
getting on in age,

it could be many things.

She should be
properly checked out.

I'll show myself out.

I'll let you out, doctor.

I think we'll finally try
it my way now, mother.

Everything alright, Alice?

Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

Thank you for coming.

Mmhmm.

Oh no, no, no, no, no...

Maybe it wasn't meant to be.

We have two healthy,
amazing kids,

we're already so lucky, baby.

I just feel like
it's my fault.

Hey, can't say that.

Maybe if I did something
differently or...

I don't know, something.

I feel like a horrible person,

I mean look at my job, and
I'm just obsessed with money,

and I market mac and
cheese, that's like,

not what I'm supposed to do,

I'm supposed to be
a writer, remember?

We have a family, we live in

an expensive city, it's logical.

Hello, Alice.

Listen, I heard
about your mother.

She doesn't need last
rites, so you can go.

I'd really like to see her.

Why do you want to see her?

Well, because I
worry about her.

You know you're too funny.

You're worried about her now.

I guess it helps that
she can't talk, huh?

Alice, may I please?

No, you may not.

Goodbye.

You cannot blame me.

I can blame whoever I want to.

Now, goodbye.

Alice.

Hey, lunch break?

Maybe on that.

You look upset,
what's up, baby?

I quit.

What?

You know the last
six weeks I've been

trying to deal with
it, and it's just

not getting any better.

The effect that little baby
had on me, it's just huge.

I can't go back
to my normal life.

I can't.

Do you remember Dr. Wiley?

Well he's sick, and he
can't keep up anymore,

so he's asked me
if I will come out,

and take over his
practice on the island.

So what do you say we
take a drive out there,

and we decide if we
want to stay, huh?

Hm?

La, la, la, la...

la, la, la, la.

Ariel.

La, la, la, la.

Ariel!

La, la, la, la.

Ariel, can
you please be quiet?

I'm trying to concentrate.

What?

La, la, la
Shut the hell up!

Morgan!
- La, la, la.

Morgan, don't you ever
talk to her that way!

Never talk
to your sister that way.

Do you hear me, young man?

La, la, la, la.
- Ever again.

Give me the iPad.
- La, la, la, la.

What?

Give me, now.
- La, la, la, la, la.

La la la.

La, la, la.
- Jeeze.

Ariel...
- La, la, la, la.

Ariel, hey!

Did you say something, mom?

Yeah, give me the iPod.

Give it to me, I don't...
Now!

Give your mother the iPod.

Enjoy the scenery, OK?

How can we enjoy the scenery
if you're forcing us to?

Was that the...

Yep, sounds like
a transmission.

What's going on?

Mommy, can you call someone?

Do we have any service?

Service...

Uh...

Shit, no.

Now we'll have to do
it the old fashion way!

Get out, take a walk...

Find a house, use a land line.

What's a land line?

Jeeze.

Alright, daddy's right.

C'mon, let's walk it, guys.

Country will be good for us.

Come on, baby.

Hit that little latch for me,

Cool.
- So cold.

I know.

Don't worry, we'll make it.

This is a great big old house.

They're bound to have
at least one phone.

I hope so.

They've got
a fireplace in there,

look at all the chimneys.

There she is.

Here we go.

Hi.

Hi.

Can I help you with something?

Yes.

Our car broke down, and
our cellphones don't work.

May we use your land line?

Oh, um, yeah, I suppose.

Thank you so
much, come on guys!

Come in, please, sit down,
make yourselves at home.

I'll show you
where the phone is.

Thank you.

The phone's right here.

Wow, thanks again for this.
- Your're welcome.

See what we got going here.

OK.

Oh, it's so dark in here.

Old people like the dark.

She's not that old, Morgan.

She thinks she is.

What's that?

I don't know.

Ah, it's going to be a while.

Uh, I'll let you do your work

and I'll go keep
your family company.

Oh, boy.

That's attractive.

So what brings
you around here?

We're actually kind
of house-hunting.

Oh really, what kind of
house are you looking for?

A good one, that's clean.

Uh, we're not really sure.

I guess, you know,
we'll probably

figure it out when we see it.

Do you have children?

No, no, no.

It's probably just my mother.

So what kind of house
would you guys like?

I want a big one, like this.

This house really
isn't so big.

It's pretty big compared
to anything in New York City.

I was actually, um,
thinking of renting it out.

You are?

You know, my mother and I
don't need all this space,

and this kind of a house
would really like a family.

Well they said
they'll be here in 45 minutes!

Well you're more than welcome

to relax in here while you wait.

Oh, thank you so much!

Thanks, actually I think I'd

really like to get
some fresh air.

Me too.

Come on, come on sweetheart.

Thank you so much, though.

You're very welcome.

Thanks again, really, truly.

You're welcome.

Pretty pleasing.

Not at all when
I was in there.

It is an impressive
place though.

I like the idea of renting as
opposed to buying, you know?

Yeah, unless
this country life

is completely horrible.

It could happen!

Okay, get her number
before we go, OK.

Yeah.

I'm going to talk to
the kids about it, K?

Good, good, good.

Wanna know something crazy?

We could actually
rent this place.

What do you think of that?

We'd have to clean it...

they remind me of hoarders!

OK, deal.

Ariel?

Ariel.

Ariel, sweetie, hey, honey.

What do you think if we
maybe rent this place?

Would you like to live here?

OK mommy.

Honey, honey look
if you don't want

to live here that's fine.

But tell me.

No, it's fine.

We just need to make
it bright inside.

OK honey, we can do that.

What is that?

Oh, cool!

You know what, I bet that
belonged to Alice, honey.

Come on, why don't we
go and give it to her?

Who knows how long it's
been since she saw it.

I can't believe you found her!

I thought my mother
threw her out!

Why would she do that?

I dunno.

I want you to have her.

Where you guys been?

The old house down there.

That house there?

People go in there and
never come back out.

I'm just kidding, come on.

What's wrong with the car?

We're driving along,
and we hear this sound

"ba da bum bum" like the
transmission dropped out.

Uh huh.

Alright, do the key.

Have a good one.

I knew when I heard...

Yeah, a
ghost's in your car, right?

Scary, woo!

Oh god, that was too weird!

So, what
brings you guys out this way?

Really?

Oh, well you know, it's funny,

I was actually thinking
of renting out this house.

This house needs a
family, you know.

Really does, can use
some life in it, you know?

It's just
way too big for me and my mom.

This could be fun.

What do you think?

Oh, it really could be.

And we could rent out
the brownstown, right?

If we could make
enough to live off of,

and, it's cheap out here.

It would be so fun.

And you could have an office,

the house is sure
big enough for it!

I could, couldn't I?

OK.

Let's just do it.

OK!

I love you too.

Sweet dreams.

Hello?

Oh, yeah.

Well that sounds wonderful.

Um, I'll probably
need a couple of weeks

to clean the place out.

And if it's OK
with you, I'd like

to leave a lot of
the big pieces here.

OK!

I think this is going to
be great for everyone.

OK.

Alright, thanks, I will...

I guess we'll speak soon!

OK, alright, bye bye now.

I've sold everything that I can.

There's nothing left to sell.

I just can't handle
the bills anymore.

So I'm going to rent the house.

If I could leave
you in it, I would.

There's a nice family that
would like to live here.

So I think we should let them.

They have children.

Oh god, you're so messy.

I'm so excited.

Hey!

Are we going to get
to come and visit?

Yeah.

We're moving!

You guys are really
moving to the country, huh?

Yeah.

The country?
- What's it like?

It's nice.
- I dunno,

we just call it the country.

This is boring, I'm
going to go get a snack.

Thanks guys!

Hey, thanks for
the help, you two!

I got to tell you baby,

I didn't think we
were going to make it.

But we did.

Yeah.

I love you.

A creature?

Yeah, our little ones.

I have your lease all ready.

Um, I think it's OK.

Thank you so much.

That's for you guys.

I'll give this to you.

Thank you.
- Here's your pen.

Thank you.
- Sure.

I don't know what to say,
if you need anything...

call me, and enjoy the house.

Oh, and...

You have fun, OK?

Take care of baby doll!

My mom is in the car,
so if you don't mind,

I'm going to get
out of your way!

Thank you so much.
OK, I'll talk with you soon!

Alright, bye bye!

That was so sweet, baby.

You're going to have
a great life here!

Ew.

Ew!

I don't... wait, let's go.

Ugh, it's so dirty!

Ew, let's get out of here.

Ew, yucky.

Do you like this house?

Sure, I guess, there's a
lot of stuff to jump over.

You don't feel
funny or anything?

What's that mean?

Ariel, you want to play?

No.

What's wrong with you?

Nothing.

I wish I had a brother.

Oh, Jon.

Can you look?

I don't wanna.

It's not funny.

Smudgey's not there.

OK.
- Oh, crap.

What are we going to do?

Why am I laughing?

Why are you laughing?

Well, well, we'll
get another one,

he'll never know the difference.

You got to be kidding, Morgan?

Morgan notices everything.

OK...

I'll just have to tell him.

But he was there
when we got here!

He's somewhere in this house!

He might be.

But know this, if
we can't find him,

your mom and I will
get you another one.

I don't want another one!

I want my Smudgey!

I'll find him!

I hope so!

Not likely.

Here we go.

I feel so good.

Weird.

Can you stop?

Excuse me?

You are so... hot.

Oh, baby!

Mom, we picked a room!

Really?

Yeah, we decided
to share a room,

since you know, like she
has night terrors and stuff.

Don't you guys
want your own room?

No, I don't really care.

No?

You?

No.
- Cool, alright!

Why don't you show me, guys?

Mommy, look,
it's really pretty.

I picked the small room.

Hm.

Oh.

Give me kisses!

Goodnight mama!

Goodnight!

Oh, oh!

Alright, goodnight guys!

Goodnight!

I love you!

Jon.

What baby?

You know how I am
about closet doors.

I remember specifically
closing that.

Just like this, I went...

ba-da-bum.

Gotcha!

Hit that light and snuggle.

There you go, baby.

Come here.

Wrap yourself around your hubby.

Hey baby...

what are you doing?

Honey, baby what's wrong?

Why are you crying?

Mommy!

Daddy! Mommy!

Mommy!

Ariel!

What happened?
- Mommy!

Honey, what happened?

What in the
hell is going on, baby?

Mommy!

What's wrong?

Hey baby.
- Hey, got your coat.

Thanks.

Man, what the hell
happened last night?

It was crazy, I don't
know, I don't know.

Moving is stressful
for certain,

but between Ariel's
nightmares and your...

You know maybe this like,
new lust I have for you

is something to do with
not grieving the baby,

and maybe I'm flipping it, or..

I mean I'm trying to figure
it out, but you know what?

Possibility.

I feel like a
teenager and I like it.

I'm loving it.

Are you still good
with this move?

Yeah.

Yeah?

Yeah.

And the high-speed internet
guy's coming today,

and you know, that will get us

back in touch with
the outside world.

It's good.

OK, cool.

There's a great
counselling group at the

community that Willy
used to run, so...

I'll go make an appearance.

Oh, full day, hope
it's a good one.

Yeah, I love you, my
hot little teenager.

Man, I should have done
this a long time ago.

Where's my new little toy?

Mmhmm.

OK.

Damn, just when I got my ice
cream and it was perfect...

Everything was nice...

What the hell does he want?

Jesus.

Hello, Alice.

Sorry.

It's fine.

Can I... can I come in?

Why?

I'd like to see Sophia.

What do you have, some
like weird fascination

with her or something?

Alice, please.

Come on.

Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with you,

blessed art thou above women,

and blessed is the fruit...

What are you praying for?

Her soul.

You actually think
praying is going to help?

I have faith that it will.

You don't know shit.

Look I understand
if you're upset,

it must be difficult
to see her like this.

It is for me.

She was always so beautiful.

Apparently you can't see what
her soul really looks like.

Or you wouldn't be
saying things like that.

Alice.

Don't you dare take
this out on her,

or me, for you having
failed in life.

Me having failed?

I gave up my whole life.

Now, thanks for checking on us.

You can go now.

Go!

Wanna go on a Smudgey search?

No, I'm good.

You could bring your doll.

I'm good.

We could pretend
it's a little girl

that you're trying to save.

It's a boy.

Looks like a girl to me.

He told me it's a boy.

That's creepy.

You don't look too good.

I'm fine.

I'm going to go get mama.

Mom.

Something's wrong with Ariel.

What do you mean?

She looks sick.

She seems fine to me, babe.

No, I'm not kidding, you
have to go out and see.

Honey, she ate like
a fiend at breakfast,

sick kids don't do that.

Maybe she has parasites
like "Monsters in My Stomach."

This one kid had
parasites in his stomach,

and they were eating
all the food in his gut,

so he was always hungry.

OK.

Come on.

Ariel.

Sweetie.

You don't feel good?

I told Morgan I'm fine.

You don't look fine, honey.

Come on.

Let me look at you, honey.

How do you feel?

Are you OK?

I'm sad.

About what, honey?

I don't know.

Maybe there's
lead in this house.

Lead?

Yeah, some kid on
TV, he got retarded

because he ate lead paint.

We haven't lived here
long enough for that.

And it only happens
if you're a baby.

Maybe you need more sleep...

No, not more sleep, please.

Why are they asking
me so many questions?

Go, go, go, go, go...
What are you doing, honey?

Was she talking to the baby?

Yeah, she was
talking to the doll.

It's really creepy, she
does it all the time.

Thank you so much, it's going

to be great to be back online.

No problem.

Enjoy.

Hey Morgan, internet's up!

Hi!
- HI.

Can I help you?

I'm Father Thomas,
I was friends

with the family that lived here.

I was in the neighborhood,
and I thought

I'd stop by and just say
welcome to the new family.

Thank you,
that's so sweet of you.

Uh, actually, if you're here

to try to get us to go
to church or something,

I'm sorry but I'm not
the church-going type.

But you can
understand how I might

confuse you with an Irish
Catholic with your red hair.

Actually, it's
funny, I was baptized,

but I chose to
never get confirmed.

Ah.

I just wanted to say if
there's anything I can ever do,

if I could help or if
you would like to talk,

or, um, doesn't have
to be religious,

just wanted to let you know
that I could be available.

Thank you.

That's very sweet.

I'm married to therapist though.

Well, you never know.

Anyway, keep me in mind, and
I just wanted to say welcome,

and hope to see you
around the neighborhood.

Thank you.

Nice to meet you.

Nice meeting you too.

Are you OK, mom?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Was that a priest?

Yeah, yeah, Father Thomas.

Why don't we go to church?

I don't think a priest is the
only one who can talk to God

for me, and I just...

I don't think it's good to
give your power away like that.

That's what church is about?

Yeah, it's about
a lot of things, honey.

But you know, if you
really want to go sometime,

we could check it out.

Ariel's still asleep.

Yeah maybe she's tired.

Oh, I went on
the internet today,

and I found out we can find

Smudgey with the
night vision goggles,

when it's dark, you can
see its glowing eyes!

Mmm, that sounds pretty cool.

You wanna try it?

Yeah.

Come on, you want to go
get, like, some hot chocolate

or something?

Sure, let's go.

Mom?

Mom, what are you doing?

Oh, I found the doll.

Yeah, um...

Do you know where my
night vision goggles are?

Um, I think
they're in that box

from Brooklyn in your bedroom.

K, thanks.

Sure.

Hi, welcome.

Hi there.

May I help you?

Well, my wife and
I just moved here recently,

and I saw your shop and
thought I'd check it out.

Oh, well,
double welcome, then.

Are you already familiar
with this stuff?

Or do you need some guidance?

Oh, I'm very
well acquainted with it all,

thank you.

You have quite an
impressive collection here.

Thank you.

I pick everything out myself.

I'm Sagan, by the way.

Jonathan.

Nice to meet you.

I guess I'll pick out some
surprises for my family.

That's nice.

Where are you living?

Old Post Road,
there's a house there...

Brickford house.

Right, yeah.

Alice and her mom?

Space is too big for them,

so they're leasing
out a smaller house.

Wow, sad.

So much went on there.

Bad?

Well, too much family drama.

The husband left, he
took the little boy,

it was horrible.

Alice and Sophie
just kind of became

a couple of old recluses.

Really, why?

Well Sophie was
cheating, well...

He said she was cheating.

She was something, gorgeous.

But after Charles
left, she just...

became celibate.

I'm going to shop, thanks.

Smudgey!

No, no, no, no, no!

No, no, no!

What's
wrong? What happened?

Honey, what happened?

It was down there...

What's down
there, what happened to you?

Baby?

Honey, talk to me.

What did you see, what happened?

It was down there.
- What's down there?

Hey...

Hey buddy, what's up?

Something horrible is
in the basement, dad.

What?

Yeah, he went down
there looking for Smudgey,

and something was down there,
I don't know what it was,

but it scared the
crap out of him.

Like an animal?

No, it was like a
doll, or a person,

or something, but it chased me.

Should I go look?

Yeah, you should, you
should probably take him, too.

What's in the bag?

Bag?

Goodies for my family.

Come on baby, let me
check your temperature.

Hi dad.

Hi baby.

Hey, how was work today?

So, are we going
downstairs, or what?

Let's
go do it! Let's go!

I'm going to make
spaghetti tonight guys, K?

OK, I have to change first.

OK.

It was down here, I know it.

OK, where'd you see it?

Behind the furnace.

OK, let's go look
behind the furnace.

But on the way there, let's
get all the dark spots,

so you make sure it's not here.

Or if it is here, we'll find it.

No.

No.

Alright
kid, let's keep looking.

Here's the furnace, don't
be scared, I'm with you.

I'm with you.

All clear?

Yeah.

OK whatever it was...

And I believe you saw something!

But whatever it was, it's gone.

Lucky us, huh?

We're OK, little buddy.

Here we go.

So nothing?
- Nope.

I saw something
down there, I know it.

OK Morgan.

How was work today?

It was good.

I felt like I was actually
necessary, I love that.

Great.

On the way home today,
I found my favorite store,

My Dreams, I got a present
for my whole family.

This is for your brother.

Thanks, dad.

This is for you.

Now these are called
dream catchers,

they will help you
stop having bad dreams!

And this is for my girlfriend.

Brainwave meditation, you
just put it in your CD player,

put your headphones on, relax,

it takes you into
a deep meditation

and you don't even have
to work at it, nothing.

Nothing?

I'm telling you.

Thank you.

You're welcome, baby.

More, mom.

No, more!

Sweetie, you're never
going to eat that much.

Arial, that's disgusting.

What, I like spaghetti.

God, you'd think we
never fed this child.

She has parasites, dad.

I already told mom, it's
like Monsters in My Stomach.

Do you think I have parasites?

Of course you don't.

No honey, I don't think
you have parasites, OK?

I think Morgan is
just scared for you

because you've been acting
all weird lately, OK?

Everything's fine.

Will you please
stop it, mom, huh?

Come on, just stop it.

Help me, help me, help me!

Help me, help me, help me!

Please, stop!

Shh.

Oh my god, there's
something under the bed,

it's really big, and it's
got hair, it's really scary.

Oh my god, it's...

No, no, no!

No!

Oh my god, it's under there!

It's under there,
I'm telling you!

Don't go! Don't go,
it's under there.

No, don't, it's
going to get you!

Honey, there's
nothing there, baby.

There's nothing there!
- No, it's there,

it's there, I'm not kidding.

No, don't.

There's honestly
nothing there, baby.

No, look!

You are scratched.

Oh my god!

Baby, how did this happen?

Does that hurt?

Does that hurt?

Baby.

Hm.

Good morning.

Good morning.

How you doing?

Good.

It's all well.

So the exterminator is
coming this morning.

Oh, good.

What do you think it is?

Maybe a nutria, I don't know.

Oh, one of those giant
40 pound rat things?

Actually I think
they're a close relation

to the guinea pig.

Whatever.

Good morning, guys.

She had bad dreams last
night, like really bad.

I guess the dream
catcher didn't work.

Yeah, change is
hard for young people.

Change?

This was happening way
before we moved, remember?

Things have gotten more intense
though, since we got here.

Maybe we should just move out.

No, I want to stay here.

I don't want to move.

I don't either.

OK guys, see you tonight.

I love you, I love you.

Love you.

Alfred, tell
us about it, would you?

And I just can't
get rid of his clothes!

I know I have to it, I mean who

wants his sneakers and
everything, they're brand new.

But I know I have
to get past this,

I know I have to accept
the fact that he's gone.

But I can't, it's
constantly there.

It's like it's.

And now I'm gonna
have to live with it,

but I just can't let it go.

I understand, Alfred.

It's OK, Alfred, go ahead.

Alice, can we talk?

About?

Couple of things,
did anything strange

ever happen in
that house for you?

Strange how?

Unexplainable things?

There's a lot of
unexplainable things

that have a perfect explanation.

True, true.

I was wondering, you sat through

the whole meeting
without sharing,

is there anything you'd
like to talk about?

No, thank you though.

I know you're still
upset about your mother,

I'm a great sounding board.

No, thank you.

Anything you say would be
kept confidential of course.

Look, I never
studied psychology

or anything like that.

But I do know things, and I know

that when you hold things
in, for a very long time,

they become a part
of you, and I've been

holding in things for a
very, very long time, doctor.

What are you grieving, Alice?

Life.

Thank you.

Sophie.

Sophie.

Oh my god...

What are you...

Oh no!

Dirty, filthy,
crumb-infested whore!

Please

Don't cry for her!

She does not deserve
it, turn and walk.

Morgan, can I
please use your extra?

Yeah!

We've got a whole big
thing of it, sweetie.

Look, these ones you can
actually see through,

but then there's others, look,

like this one, we can
just put it somewhere.

We can hang it up.

Sure!

Jinx!

Hi.

Hey.

Wait a minute, aren't you...

Hey, yeah, it's me.

You were the AAA guy?

Yeah, I'm like jack
of all trades, you know.

Part time exterminator,
part time mechanic,

I even do massage if
you ever need one.

I'm good.

OK.
- Yeah, thanks.

So we got a problem, and I
think it's in the basement.

Critters?

I think, I'm not sure.

This time of year, you know.

Really?
- Mmhmm.

Huh.

Looks good.

Closet's safe.

Let me take you down.

Great.

Crazy kids...

They're having some
good filthy fun.

Yeah, they're adorable.

Alright, come
on, watch your step.

Don't want you to get
killed or nothing.

Nope.

Wow, you've got to clean this...

Oh, real problem you got
here is a hoarder problem.

That was a rent-in.

Pretty good shape,
considering it's just those

two old crusting women been
living here all these years.

Gee, nice.

Yeah, I calls
'em as I sees them.

Well, would you look at that.

You know what's so funny?

I've been looking
for one of these.

You know what's funny is
I've been looking around here

and there's nothing here,
everything's perfect

Ah!

It's fine, your house is clean
bill slate, it's all good.

Woah, ow my head!

Ah, the door.

Ah, it's open.

This house is fine,
just make sure that

the windows and the doors
are locked at night,

and I know that you
said you bolt locked it,

you know, keep these things...

Wait.
- Uh...

Sure you don't
want to look around some more?

No, your house is
fine, you know there's

nothing going on here,
so just have a good day,

have a good night, have a...

This is free, don't
worry about it.

No charge!

Thanks.

Alice.

Father Thomas, hi.

Hi, is everything OK?

What are you...

How is your mother?

She's fine, she's fine.

No, no, yeah I'm
actually here for me.

Ah.

Are you alright?

In all these years
that have passed,

no one person ever
asked me that question.

Not one.

Now that my mom is sick,
and her health is failing,

there's all this
concern out of nowhere.

I'm sorry, that must be hard.

No, no the last
40 years were hard.

This isn't.

Nice to see you.

Thanks for your concern.

I have to go.

Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Bishop!

In 50 years we'll be dead,

but that reflection
will always be there.

Who loves you?

Are you still playing
with that thing?

You got to stop
playing with it...

Give it back to us!

He's going to tell her.

Don't worry, he'll never tell.

I think what
you're doing is fine,

don't you worry about a thing.

Just keep it up.

We'll see you soon.

Excuse me.

Can I help you?

I'm Father Thomas.

Father Thomas, how do you do?

You met my wife the other
day at our new place, Cecile.

Yes I did, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

You're the therapist,
that's right.

Excuse me?

Oh, uh, nothing.

I ran into Alice Brickford,
and I'm wondering,

is she OK?

I mean did you happen
to speak with her?

I'm a friend of the family
for a very long time.

OK, well maybe you should
ask her yourself then.

See I wish
it were that simple.

But we had a falling
out years ago, so...

A priest, having a falling
out, that's not very...

very godlike of you, huh?

No, but it is human.

So what do you need?

Um, I'm not sure, I'm
just trying to help.

With?

Well, I...

I have a strange sense that
something has happened,

or is happening.

Is happening?

I'm not following, Father.

You see, years ago, when
someone was sensitive,

it was unacceptable
to use one's abilities

in any way that was outside
of the church, or religion.

And that's...

and that would be you?

Yes.

Yes, I was never quite sure
what to do with my acute senses,

so that's why I
joined the priesthood.

So what is that you...

that you sense.

A great sadness.

My wife and I, we...

we lost a baby recently.

Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

But this is something
different, it's something else,

something that involves Alice,

but it also involves
your family.

I'm afraid there's a connection.

Ariel!

Mommy, mommy, help!
- Morgan?

Morgan?

Morgan?

Please help, please!

Ariel!

Morgan, what's wrong?

Mommy! Help
me, please help me.

Mommy,
Ariel's locked in there!

Ariel?

Ariel!

Ariel!

Mommy!
- Ariel, are you OK?

Oh my god, here, call your dad.

Call your dad, tell him to
meet us at the hospital.

Oh honey, oh my god!

Dad, something happened to
Ariel we don't know what...

Oh honey, oh my god.

Please meet
us at the hospital!

Please dad!

Did she get this cut when
she was playing with you?

I don't know, mommy!

Dad, please come
to the hospital,

we don't know what's going on,

we found her like this...

Wake up, baby!

We just found her!

We don't know what's going on!

Please!

Morgan, when we get downstairs
I need you to get the coat.

Mommy.

Oh, Missy, oh,
how did this happen?

My arm.
- Who hurt you honey?

Who?

The boy...
- What boy,

what are you talking about?

Oh my god, look at her!

Oh my god!

Come here, baby.

Come on, go to
daddy honey, go.

Oh, baby.

Open up.

You're doing this on purpose.

Eat this.

Oh!

Eat this, mom!

Fine, you know
what, I don't care.

Maybe you'll starve to death.

Here you go, baby.

I've got that door.

What's wrong, little buddy?

We shouldn't
go in, I know it.

Let's go inside
where it's warm,

and we'll figure things out, OK?

Something's not right.

Morgan, I will
take care of you.

I will protect you from
anything and everything always.

Do you believe me?

OK, let's go inside.

Hey.

She's sound asleep, huh?

Yeah.

You know, ever
since we got here,

it's been getting a
lot worse for Ariel.

And for me, like, I don't
know what's going on with me,

but it's getting more intense.

And I don't know if
it's my imagination,

or it's this house,
or what, but, god,

I love the way I feel.

And I don't want this
sensation to end,

and it makes me feel so guilty.

Well doll-face, I
love how you feel too.

Maybe we should
talk to Alice, huh?

What good do you really
think that would do?

Well I think Alice
knows something.

Hm.

Let's go in with the kids,

it was really scary for
them what happened today.

Yeah.

I'll listen to
that CD you got me.

Please, no!

Oh my god!

Oh my god!

You have to listen to this!

It's so horrible,
oh my goodness.

Oh my god!

I'm sorry babe, I don't
hear anything, just...

just the gong.

I think it's your unconscious
mind at work, doll.

No, please, you got
to listen to more,

there was a child's voice.

I read once when something
really intense happens,

it leaves an
impression on reality.

I think that's
what hauntings are.

So you think this
place is haunted?

No.

But I think maybe you
picked up on something.

Something that, you know how

when there's an
argument in the room,

and everybody leaves the room,

there's still tension left over.

If there's a big argument,

there's going to be lots
of residual tension.

I believe that.

I agree.

Thank you, little buddy.

Help me, help me, help me.

Ariel.

Ariel.

Morgan?

It's me, mom.

You OK, honey?

Yeah, I'm fine.

What are doing,
you have a nightmare?

I'm just looking outside.

At what?

The snow.

I'm hungry, mom.

Now?

Yes.

You can't wait 'til breakfast?

No, I need it now.

OK honey, come on.

Mama will feed you.

Come on, sweetheart, it's OK.

Let's go get you
something, baby.

OK?

Oh please, bacon and eggs!

Oh look there, can
we have bacon too?

Yep, definitely.

It's good!

It's 4:30 in the morning.

She was really hungry.

Oh.

Not a way to start school
the first day, huh?

Oh baby.

That was some storm, huh?

I know, and it's all going
to melt by this afternoon.

Yeah.
- Crazy, huh?

I'm going to lay down, OK?

I'm going to clean this
up, then we'll all go back

upstairs and go
back to sleep, OK?

OK.

Ai ya.

Hey, hey? Oh, baby.

What are you doing up?

Why are you

Mommy!

Who was that?

Was that Morgan?

What's going on?

See, there's Morgan.

Let's go baby, here we go.
- Come on, get in.

Oh you poor kid,
you must be freezing!

Hey baby, what
did you find out there for us?

Wow.

Look at this.

Take the top off.

Where'd you get this?

Hey, check this out.
- It was outside.

Look at that, Alice Brickford.

Oh my gosh, look it's
from when she was little.

Yeah, cool.

Let's see what we
got going here.

"Bird dropped today, I
hope we heard them sing,"

OK.

"I wish she would
just disappear.

"Then I could take care of them.

"I hate her."

Well, you know what, this
might not be good for the kids.

So we'll read it first,
and if it's good,

we'll tell you about it, OK?

Come on, let's get
you cleaned up, OK?

What's going to happen?

Hey guys, what's up?

Do I have to go?

Yeah, of course you do.

After everything
that's happened here,

you need to just go and
do something normal,

like going to school.

Are you going to be OK alone?

Of course I'm
going to be OK alone.

You know what?

Maybe I go look for the Smudgey.

Don't!

He's in the basement,
but don't go.

OK you know what,
maybe I'll write,

that's what I'm
supposed to be doing.

Can we move, like not move
neighborhoods, just houses?

No, please no,
he told me not to.

He asked me.

Who?

I promised him.

You know what,
let's go now, OK?

Come on, let's go,
I'm going to get

a coffee on the way
back from school,

and everything's fine.

Come on, it'll be
good for us all.

Sophia, listen...

Oh my god, Thomas!

Thomas, no!

No, Thomas, no!

I can't make you
leave the seminary,

it's not right.

Sophie, I'm in love with you.

What we did was wrong,
God is going to punish us.

No, He will, He will,
God will punish us.

God is love, Sophie, He
just wants people to love.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Mom, open your mouth,
I know you can hear me.

You stupid fucking bitch!

What, you think you're
going to run away?

Where you going to go?

Who's going to want you?

Who the hell do
you think you are?

You're nothing.

You're nothing,
you're worth nothing,

everything that you
have belongs to me,

because I bought it.

You wouldn't even exist
if it wasn't for me.

I'm the one who even decides
whether you live or die.

Please, mother...

Please, I can't take it anymore.

I just can't.

I feel like you hate me so
much, and there's no reason.

I can't do this anymore.

I'm sorry.

Hi, Alice.
- Hi.

Are you busy?

Um, no, no please, come in.

Thank you so much.

I'm so sorry to just
show up like this, but...

Something crazy is going on.

I thought it was just me.

I guess it is the house.

So you know about this?

I've been dealing with
this since I'm a child.

What?

It's um, just something
that's been going on,

and it's still very
much a part of me.

That's my thing.

He's in the house.

Who?

What are you talking about?

I've lost my
entire life to this

and his mess.

It's time to let somebody
know what's really going on.

Sit down.

My mother felt
very unfulfilled in

her marriage to my father.

One day he just
stopped wanting her.

He didn't even know why.

And she had an affair.

One day, I saw them together,

and my father found out...

My mother always blamed me,

saying I was the one that told.

I wasn't the one that told.

So he left...

and he took my baby
brother with him,

as if we were both just whores.

Soon after, my mother
had a baby boy.

And I named him Sebastian.

She wanted me to kill him.

Oh my god.

But I couldn't, I refused to.

I just wanted to run away.

I wanted to take
the baby and go.

And I was so scared,
I was terrified.

I mean, I was just a child.

I was just a child.

She thought that
he was some evil,

because of her being
unfaithful to my father...

What happened to him?

He died.

Oh my god.

I think about him
every day of my life.

I'll never, ever forgive myself.

You are the only person
on the face of this earth

that knows that
Sebastian ever existed.

And that is why I will
never forgive her.

Oh my god.

Sebastian!

Sebastian!

I know who you are!

I know what happened!

You poor, poor baby!

Oh my god.

I'm so sorry.

You poor baby.

I feel you.

I feel you.

Help me please, I'm hungry!

I'm hungry!

My name is Sebastian.

What? Ariel!

Are you OK?

What do I do?

Jon?

Cecile, hi baby,
look, the school called,

yeah something
terrible's going down.

Cecile?

Damn cellphones.

Ugh.

Mom!
- Cecila!

Daddy!

Oh!

Oh baby her heart's beating.

She's awake.

Sebastian?

No, no baby it's us.

Oh no, that's his name!

What?

The bad boy, Sebastian!

He's not bad, he's not
bad, he needs us, guys.

Hello?

Yes.

Alice?

Oh no.

Oh no, I'm so sorry.

So he is real?

Yeah, he was.

I'm so sad, I can't
believe it all happened here.

I know.

I thought I was crazy.

I know, honey.

Hello?

Alice.

Hi, what's...

I'll be there in a few minutes.

Yeah.

Sophia died about an hour ago.

You should definitely go.

Yeah.

Help me, help me, help me!

Help me!

Alice...

That's horrific.

I should go to jail.

No, no, no darling
you were too young.

And you were tortured
the same as he was.

I let her take my life, the
same way she took Sebastian's.

Now that she's gone...

And Sebastian...

You know how good it is to
be able to say his name?

Anyway.

Now that Sebastian's
secret is out...

I don't have anything
to fear anymore!

Well, uh, I believe

that we are being
haunted by him.

I need your help.

I just don't know what to do.

I mean maybe, we should think
about going back to the city.

No, we can't go 'til
we find the Smudgey.

We'll find the Smudgey first,

honey, I wouldn't
leave him here.

I just don't know what to do.

I really don't.

I like being out here, but.

So much just happened
since we got here.

And I don't know what
he wants from us.

We should go.

I can't open it!

I can't open it!

Get away from the glass!

Get away, get away, get away!

What's going on in here?

You guys alright?

Oh god, what's happening?

What's going on?

What do you want from us?

What's going on?

What do you want?

What are you doing this for?

Why is this happening?

Who is she talking to?

The kid!

Sebastian!

Talk to me!

Please, tell me!

It's the devil's baby!

Oh my god!

Your name is Sebastian!

That's enough, if you continue
to feed it, it will live.

No, no, mommy!

No!

No!

If you don't do
what I tell you to,

I'm going to tell the police
what you did all these years.

Oh my god.

That's why she
wouldn't let me near her.

She was pregnant with my child!

Oh dear god...

Forgive me please,
Lord forgive me.

Sebastian!

Oh, you poor sweet soul.

What are you saying, mommy?

All he ever wanted was
somebody to love him.

That's all he wanted.

I love you, mommy.

Oh, we have to stay
here, we have to stay here.

He needs us to help him.

I can love you, I can love
you, little guy, I can.

Oh, Jon, I know everything...

Why didn't you come to me?

Because I was scared.

Sebastian was his name?

Yeah.

Did anyone love him?

I did.

Oh god, I loved him so much.

I've lived all my life
with a broken heart.

It's Sebastian!

Oh, I can feel him!

Oh, it's him!

Hey, little baby brother!

Oh god, I love you so much!

Smudgey!

It's Smudgey!

Yes!

Come on!

Let's go, quick, quick, go!

Come on, quick, quick, quick!

Let's go!

Come on!

Love you, bye!

Have a good day
at school, guys!

Hurry hurry, don't miss it!

Don't miss it!
- Go, go, go.

Wait you're staying home?

I'm going to hang
out with mom today.

Don't have too much fun!

Get out of here!

Have a good day!

I love you, Sebastian!

I can't wait to meet you!

Alright, hurry up, you guys
are going to miss the bus, go!

Bye mom, bye Sebastian!
- Bye sweetheart!

Love you guys!

Ariel...

Come on, we're going
to miss the bus.
