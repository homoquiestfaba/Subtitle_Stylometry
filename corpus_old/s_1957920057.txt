[audience] <i>Ow!</i>

today an upper ankle sprain

Olympic hopeful, Abigail Simpson,</i>

couldn't recover from,

but enough to pull
me from my spot.

Why didn't you try again?

It took everything my parents
could muster to get me that far

and I didn't wanna wait
another four years.

My plans had changed.

I decided I wanted to teach

and coach the next group
of Olympic hopefuls

which is you guys.
[chuckles softly]

Now, go put your skates on. We've a lot of
hard work before the Christmas Ice Parade.

been hard to watch.

me, Janet, it was.

But showing it to the
class makes a point.

Which is?
Don't get cocky

and start believing
in your own publicity.

Let's go.

[lively emotional music]



a little advertising?

We can offer some
sort of discount code,

or special beginner class,

make a great stocking stuffer.

And how you think I'm gonna pay
for advertising? My good looks?

Exactly!

Abbie, you were almost famous.

You still are!

Look, let's plaster your
name and picture on a poster.

We could put them all over town.

We're already promoting
the Christmas Ice Parade.

Let's make it more interesting.

Look, I don't know.

It, it sounds desperate.

Like I'm giving up.

You listen to yourself?

Isn't that what
you're already doing?

Giving up?

Wow. Aren't you supposed
to be my best friend?

Your bestest.
Okay.

Well, then go supervise the kids.
Oh.

Aye, aye, Captain.

And don't look so down.

You act like you're
the only person

to ever go through
something like this.

What if I am?

What if you're not?

Goodbye.

Mm-hmm.

[lively Christmas music]

[tray rattling]

[John in RP accent] No. Go! Get it
outta the zone. Get it outta the zone.

Go! No!

No. Come back! Get him. Get him.
[sighs]

it. You can do it.

Stop him. Stop him.
Don't let him get there.

No! Stop!
[referee whistles on TV]

Stop! Aah!

[cheering on TV]

It's impossible. It's
bloody impossible.

And, yet... [sighs]

And yet... it's true.

[flicks TV switch]
[mischievous music]

We lost.

Oh, dear. Again, Your Highness?

Again.

Defeat snatched from
the jaws of victory.

Perhaps this will help
you calm yourself.

calm at a moment like this?

It is but a game, Your Highness.

But a game?

Are you serious, Marshall?

There's no such
thing as but a game.

If you say so, sir.

I do say so!

Hockey is not just a game,

it's a sport.

[sighs sharply]

It's my sport.

Of course, Your Highness, and
a very noble sport it is too.

But, every contest must
have a winner and a loser.

Fair play and all that.

Mm. [inhales]

It's high time I did
something about it.

You, sir? Do you plan
to take up the sport?

Marshall, of course not.

But I could buy a team.

And that way, I'd have some
say in how things are done.

Your own ice hockey team?

Certainly a bold
idea, Prince John.

And one you should
pursue in the new year.

Don't be silly, Marshall.

I plan on moving forward on
this business immediately.

As in right now.

the Royal Family is your business.

sound like my mother.

Look, I'm the youngest son
in the monarchy of sons.

I will never be king.
- True.

LI need to have somethingn
in ton my own. y of sons.

Something that belongs to me,
something that I'm passionate about.

Something that's really
mine, away from the family.

What better than my
own sports franchise?

Minor League, of course,

but how fantastic.

Of course.
[John chuckles]

And then, all the profits
from the merchandising

will go direrectly
back to the people...

by way of my
preexisting charities.

Very noble, Your Highness,

but how do you plan
to achieve this?

By going to America.
America?

Yes, I can't manage
all of this on my own.

I need to go there to
set up a co-venture.

Partnership of sorts.

I need to go there
[mischievous music continues]


I've a meeting with
him in a few days.

I have a very small
window of opportunity.

I'm planning on seizing it.
But, Your Highness,

the Royal Christmas
Festivities are imminent.

You're expected to be there.

I will, Marshall, I'll be there.

But I have to do this first.
It means everything to me.

[sighs deeply]

And I need your silence.

Can I count on you?

Mm-hmm.

Ah, good.

Silence is golden.

I have a plane to catch.

And see that these are taken care of?
Yes.

[lively Christmas music]
[sighs]

[Daryl] Oh, there he is.
Mr. Blake.

Your Highness,
please call me Daryl.

Okay then, Daryl.

Uh, in fact, why don't we
dispense with the formalities?

Uh, my name is John,
so we won't be needing

any of the royal designations
from here on out.

Are you sure? A
royal title can open

an awful lot of doors
in a town like this.

And the accent
doesn't hurt either.

Yeah, it can also
close a lot of doors.

Can even double the
price of admission.

So, let's just keep
it in our back pocket,

as you Americans say,
until it's useful.

Whatever you say, Prince.

I mean... John. [chuckles]

Care to take a walk?
Uh, absolutely. Lead on.

I'd like to do next</i>

<i>is to assemble a short list</i>

of potential investors, huh,

to come on board to help
make this team a reality.

I'm thinking of calling
it "The Monarchy."

The Monarchy.

I love that. Very clever.

And with you as the face of the
franchise, well, it's a perfect fit.

Oh, I couldn't agree more.

Ready to see your future?
Indeed, I am. Lead on.

Right this way.

[John sighs]

Now, even though they are
minor league franchise,

we've made arrangements
for the team

to play in the finest arenas
the sport has to offer.

Like this. What do you think?

grand, Daryl.

Something I've only dreamed of.
Yeah.

We're gonna make that
dream become a reality.

You understand?

I mean, look at this.

Luxury boxes,
five-star restaurants,

cocktail lounges, celebrity
endorsements by the dozen.

You name it. It's all
there for the taking.

[exhales sharply] This
is all so fantastic.

I'm sold.

What do we need to do
to make this happen?

I'll tell you what
we need to do.

We leave town.

Leave town?
Yep. Leave town.

I am afraid I'm not following.

Prince, professional sports
franchises are all over the place.

The Buffalo Bills
play at Orchard Park.

The Los Angeles
Angels are in Anaheim.

The Giants don't even
play in the same state.

We move outside the mainstream,

build d our training
facility, our base camp,

and we g everything we alwlways
dreamed of at a fraction of the ct.

Yes. Now I'm following you.

I think I've got
just the location.

Evanston.

Evanston.
Yep.

The Evanston Monarchy.

Ooh!
That's where you build.

In a small town, not
some gigantic metropolis.

Instead, an elegant little town

that becomestown, notthe
home of your brand.is.

And you know what? I've gotta a
lead on the perfect location there.

you think about it.

Oh, I, I am. I, I am thinking about it.
Better yet,

you, you should go up there.
Check it out for yourself.

Yeah. It's less
than an hour away.

That's a great idea.

Just don't breathe a word
of this to anybody, okay?

News gets out, press
goes up, up, up.

Play your cards right,
all this... can be yours.


Thank you.

[gentle Christmas music]

Lee, shoulder's back.

Head up.

That's beautiful,
Jamie. I love it.

the hang of ice-skating.

You make it look so effortless.

Let me guess. You
didn't come here

to watch the kids
skate, did you?

No.
Look, if it's about the rent for the classroom space,

I'll have it soon.
[sighs] Listen, Abbie.

I love what you're doing with these kids.
[melancholic music]

But...?

The owner of this building

is thinking of
closing it entirely.

Wait, are you serious?
Absolutely.

I think they want to turn
it into something else

or maybe even sell
it completely.

Mr. Curtis, I need this place.

This is where my classroom is.

Look, it's Christmas. I
really need the money.

Mm.
Come on.

We're working on some
really big promotions.

Promotions? What kind?

Your Christmas Ice Parade?

So how are ticket
sales going over that?

Well, they, they could be
better, but they're steady.

That's good to hear, Abbie.

I'll see you in a week.

[lively Christmas music]

And then Bradley's pass gets
deflected in the end zone

and still caught by
Johnson for a touchdown.

Craziest thing I've
ever seen in my life.

[Abigail] Hey, Al.
[doorbell chimes]

Hey, Abbie.

You, uh, come for
your momma's cake?

You bet. Is it ready?
Sure is.

Just gimme a second.
Okay.

[sighs deeply]

[lively Christmas music]

[horn honks]


All right.

Here it is.

It's as nice as I can make it.

And it's paid for already,
so you can take her away.

It's beautiful.

Will I see you at
the party tonight?

I got an after-hours
delivery coming in,

eggnog frozen yogurt,

but maybe, if it doesn't get
too late, I could still stop by.

Sounds good. Oh, and thanks
for putting up the poster.


But, hey, how come your
name is not on the poster?

Because it's not about me.
It's about the students.

Hey, people would pay big
money to see you skate again.

Al, please.

a lot more tickets.

Guaranteteed box office.

I'll think about it.

Thanks again.
All right.

[cheerful Christmas music]

Hey, hey!

Merry Christmas, Abigail.

Oh, Merry Christmas, Don.

ChristOh!, Abigail.



I am so sorry.

Let me help.


Well, I'm sure we can fix it.

[mischievous music]

I, I'm sorry, Abbie, there's
nothing I can do with this.

I knew it. My mom's
gonna kill me.

can make another one?

In time for tonight's
winter festival?

I don't think so.

I mean, can we?

Maybe.
Uh, how much time do you need?

A few hours at least.
I, I, I'm swamped today.

[sighs] Still have so much to do before tonight.
Look,

I feel terrible about this.

Let me pay for a new cake.
It's the least I can do.

Works for me.
[Abigail] Okay.

Thanks, Al. I'll come
by later tonight.

Hey, excuse me.

Uh, sorry, I didn't
catch your name.

It's Abigail.

I'm John.

[mellow music]

[mischievous music]

Hey.

Hey, Abbie, wait up.

[chuckles softly]
Hey, Chad.

I heard you were in town.

Oh, you look a little
down, is something wrong?

Uh, the cake for tonight's party
got ruined, but that's all.


Look, I, I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Then, I won't keep you.

Listen, ever since I
got back into town,

I've just been thinking
a lot about you.

Really?
[chuckles softly]

Well, that's flattering.

Look, I know I'm not the quarterback
of the varsity football team anymore

and you're not The
Princess On Ice,

but it doesn't mean we can
give it another shot, right?

I've just been thinking
a lot about the future.

Now, maybe there might
be a future for us.

That's really sweet, but I have
a lot on my plate right now.


But on a more serious note, um,

the real estate market around
here is exploding and expanding,

and Mr. Curtis has some
really big plans for me.

Yeah, I saw him earlier too.

He told me someone's
trying to convert

the ice rink into
something more profitable.

I mean, I've heard a few things,
but those are just rumors, Abbie.

I'm sure there are
other ice rinks.

You know, I could really be of some
assistance to you, if you'd just let me.

All I need is you
back in my life again.

Look, there's a lot of reasons
why people break up, Chad.

We really tried, but...

we just weren't
the right couple.

You know, and I could
help you with your school.

We could be partners.

You could hire some
teachers. I mean,

why keep risking your health
out there on the ice, you know?

You got lucky once.

Could have been a lot worse.

Yeah, but it wasn't.

I know you.

And I know you wouldn't be
sitting on the sideline,

not competing if you
weren't worried too.

Let me take that worry away.

Come on.

I'll think about it. Okay?

It's good to see you.
You too.

[solemn music]

your brother's not seen out

with the same woman on
his arm every night,

why do people find
that interesting?

Honestly, he could
easily find himself a,

a suitable heiress
who adores him.

I mean, Mother would love that.

But...

he chooses the
life of a bachelor.

[soft chuckle] Unwilling
to settle down.

Why is that, do you think?

It's perfectly simple.

He's never found a
woman fascinating enough

to freeze him in his tracks.

You mean he's never found a woman
who could hold her own with him?

Perhaps, but don't give up on
himim just yet, Your Hiness.

Wellgood luck changing his mind.

[chuckles sarcastically]
Have you seen this?

What is it?
See for yourself.

Please, Marshall, sit.

A business plan?
He's trying to start his own professional ice hockey team

in America no less.

A business plan?
He's trying to start his own profeslce hockey team? y team

His obsession with the sport
has finally gone to his head.

He eats, sleeps and breathes
professional ice hockey.


Oh, but he is.

As he sees it, he's finally going
to do something for himself,

have something all his own.

And...

I can understand where
he's coming from.

I mean,

I knew he was head over
heels for the sport,

but I didn't realize
it had gone this far.

What ever will Mother think?

Perhaps she doesn't
need to know about it.

Not just yet, anyway.

I think we owe your brother
that much, don't you?

[soft chuckle] Agreed.

[gentle music]


Hey, I'm home.
[Abigail] Hi, Mom.

[door closes]

[Carol grunts]
Oh, let me give you a hand.

Oh, thanks. Here, take
the one under my arm

before I drop it. [chuckles]

Where's your father?
Oh, he's at the center.

He's decorating for the party tonight.
Oh, perfect.

I don't want him snooping around
in my packages. [chuckles]

Oh, did you buy
him something nice?

Of course not.

I bought myself something.


So what are you up to?

Christmas cards for my friends.

I don't have enough money to buy gifts this year.
I know.

But they'll understand.

Everything is going to be fine.

So, where's the cake?

[mischievous music]

Uh, about that.

Oh, no, don't tell me.

Well, I went to pick it up today

and there was this guy who wasn't
looking where he was going,

and he ran right into me and
knocked it right outta my hands.

It's ruined.
Oh, dear.

But, but, it's gonna be okay.

They're making a new one.
They're gonna deliver it

directly to the center,
so... everything's good.

How are you? Are you okay?

[sad music]

You mean, like, am I hurt?

No, I'm fine.

So who ran into you?
Was it anybody we know?

Um, no, I don't think so.

Some guy with a
fancy foreign accent.

Maybe a, a John somebody.

Hmm.

Was he handsome?

Mother, please.

Well, was he?

Yeah.

Hmm.
[sighs deeply]

[cellphone ringing]


Marshall?
[Marshall on the phone] <i>I'm sorry to disturb you,</i>

<i>Your Highness, but I
was just ringing to see</i>

<i>if you'd come to
your senses yet.</i>

Oh.

[mischievous music]

Absolutely not.

Look, Prince John, I'm
very concerned about you,

as is your brother.
Roger? Concerned about me?


Does my mother
know anything yet?

No, Your Highness,

I've been able to
cover for you thus far.

Luckily, she's been very busy
with her holiday preparations.

That's good, Marshall.

But I cannot continue
this charade much longer.

She's bound to find
out sooner or later.

So what if she does?

I'm not a child anymore.

I have a right to live
my own life as I see fit.

<i>Most assuredly, sir.</i>

<i>But you should at least keep
them abreast of your movements.</i>


in time.

<i>I'll return shortly...</i>

when I'm ready.

Your Highness, you're making
my job rather difficult.

Well, at is my goal in
life, isn't it, Marshall?

[sighs]
No if you'll excuse me,

I have a party to attend.

No, no, no.

Please don't, don't
hang up on me.

Merry Christmas, Marshall.

Merry Christmas, Your Highness.


Marshall!

Where is my son?


Well, uh, I, I believe he's
at the, uh, Royal Banquet Hall

finalizing the menu
for Christmas brunch.

I'm not asking you
about Prince Roger.

I'm asking you about
my youngest son, John.

He's about yay high

and not too big around.

Of course, Your Majesty.

Well, uh...

I'm afraid, truth be told,

he's, uh,

gone off

to America unexpectedly.

Ah, of course.

So if this was, as you suggest,
an unexpected decision,

he can't possibly have any
great amount of cash with him.

He would have to rely
heavily on his credit cards.

You know what to do then.

Follow the trail.

Your Majesty.


[cellphone ringing]


Marshall, you need
to stop phoning me.

Won't do any good, and I'm
starting to get irritated.

Prince John, it's Daryl Blake.

Oh, of course, Daryl.

<i>- My apologies.</i>
[laughs]

I was having a bit of a moment
with one of my staff back home.

<i>Not a problem at
all. Must be tough</i>

keeping all those balls in
the air at the same time.

Just wondering how things
are going out in Evanston.

Oh, Evanston is everything
you said it was.

Small, quaint... lovely people.

Beautiful. I knew that you would like it. I knew it.
<i>- Indeed, I do.</i>

And you mentioned you had
your eye on a property

for a new training
facility, right?

Don't worry about that just yet.

The important thing
here is that you can

see yourself setting up shop
in that charming little town.

<i>And it sounds like you can.</i>

I believe you've hit
on something, Daryl.

I knew I was right to trust you.

Thank you. Thank you, Your
Highness. It's excellent.

Um, listen, enjoy
your time in Evanston,

and I'm here if you need me,
and, uh, you'll be back soon?

Soon it is. Cheers.


[gentle music]

[people chattering]
[happy music]

So sweetheart,
what do you think?

Pretty snazzy, huh?

Oh, it's nice.

Very nice.

Uh, Larry, you did a great
job. I'm proud of you.

Well, I had some help.

Well, I hope you let the younger
ones get up on the ladder.

Absolutely. No more
ladders for me.

Hey, come here.

Oh, it's beautiful.
Right?

[Carol] When did he drop it off?
[Larry] Well, he didn't.


Well, if Al didn't
deliver, who did?


My apologies. I couldn't
help but overhear.

I'm John.
Oh.

Carol, John's staying
at the Mountmore Hotel.

We met earlier.


They have nice rooms,
very old-fashioned.

Oh, yeah. Absolutely right.

don't mean to pry,

but, tell me,

why did you want to
deliver the cake yourself?

ruined the cake in the first place.

[mischievous music]

Uh, yes, regretfully so.

Good evening, uh, Miss Abigail,
you look very pretty tonight.

Oh, thank you.
[Janet clears throat]

Oh, uh, Janet, this is John.
[gentle music]

Very pleased to meet you, John.
[John] The pleasure's mine.

So, Abigail, what do you think?

You know, I'm impressed.

I didn't think Al could do it.
[chuckle]

Yeah, I know. Yeah.

John, could you help us for
a moment in the kitchen?

Oh, why... Yes, of course.

Uh, ladies.

[Carol chuckling] Come here.

Oh, dear.

Abbie, why are you being
so cold to that guy?

Was just an accident.

And he's so good-looking,

so sophisticated,

and that accent... Wow!

Well, accents aren't everything.
Maybe not.

But I think he likes you.

[soft chuckles] Well, I doubt that.
Really?

Why would he go through all that
trouble to deliver that cake in person?

Guilty conscience?
[chuckles]

I can't believe you.
You're acting like a kid.

Well, how do you want me to act?

We're at a party. We're
supposed to be having fun.

So start acting like that.

All right.

I want you to promise me

you'll be as sweet as pie to
the very next person you meet.

You promise?

I promise.

Merry Christmas, Abbie.

[mischievous music]

Chad.

Well, good luck with that.

If you two will excuse me.


[muffled chatter]

Oh, right here. You can help us put
the bags in the boxes. [chuckles]

So, John, are you going to
be in Evanston for very long?

Oh, no, no, not long.

Just conducting a
little business.

Oh, what sort of business are
you looking to get involved in?

Larry, don't be so nosy.

No, it's all right.

It's just a little project
that I'm working on.

I have some pressing holiday
engagements back home,

so not long, I'm afraid.


Evanston is a wonderful
place to spend Christmas.

I'm sure it is.

And I'd also love to get to
know Abbie a little more.

If, if I could.

[gentle music]

And again, I, I am so sorry
about everything that happened.

Don't worry about that.

She's a very
understanding person.

She just, uh, feels stressed
about work right now.

Abbie teaches skating
down at the ice rink

and her class is a little
underwhelming at this time of year.

That's too bad.

Is it a beginner's class?

All levels. It's mostly just
young people trying to have fun.

Abbie was an Olympic
hopeful a few years ago,

but she had a little mishap
during a jump and didn't qualify.

Oh, dear.

Did she give it another go?
[Larry] No.

The whole thing was
broadcast on TV.

Everybody saw it, and
she was humiliated.

That's a pity.

I think I know something
that just might cheer her up.

I'm all the ears.


The only reason I
came here tonight was,

I was hoping to run into you.

Uh, really?

Why is that?
I wanted to apologize

if I came out a little
strong the other day.

Don't.

I could've been better myself.

What I should have
said was, I miss you.

I wanna make this a Christmas
we can both remember.

And I got you a
little something.

Um...

You know what? I, I can't.

I mean...

Thank you.
[chuckles softly]

It's beautiful, but
I can't accept this.

Here, let me help you.

Uh.
[Chad] Turn around. Just humor me.

but I think that's a marvelous idea.
Yes. [chuckles]


It's been a long day.

Uh, perhaps I should
say goodnight.


Do you have to? Uh...

[sighs] - we haven't
even cut the cake yet.

Yeah. I, I thought you
wanted to talk to Abbie.

Oh, well I do, but looks like
she's wrapped up at the moment.


But don't forget what I
told you about tomorrow.

I won't. And thankou.

[gentle music]


Just got a lot on
my mind, I guess.

Nice necklace.

Pricey.
Yeah, it was hard to say no,

but I'm just not interested
in reviving old flames.

The Ice Skating Princess and
The Football King. [chuckles]

That was a long time ago.

Yeah, he wants to pick up
right where we left off,

but I just don't
see us together.

I mean, he's a nice guy, but...

I don't know, it's
just been too long.

Sometimes people change.

I have enough going on.
Okay. That's fair.

Oh, that fella, John,

he was asking about you.

Mom, don't go match-making me again.
He'll be gone before you know it.

Of course, you are
right. [chuckles]

But he just seems so
debonair, so cultured.

You're starting to
sound like Janet.

in diamonds, the other in cake.

I'm sure you look
beautiful in both.

You're a riot.
[chuckles]

Good night, sweetheart.


[sighs deeply]

[gentle Christmas music]

Why are you following me?

Me? [snickers] Never.

So you just wander in here where
it's a constant 35 degrees?

We, Europeans, we're
very warm-blooded people.


this is my private
time in the ice.

It's the only alone
time I get, so...

Ah, yes.

Of course, of course.
Uh, my apologies.

I didn't mean to
intrude or interrupt.

I was speaking with
your mother last night,

and she told me about
your skating classes,

and I thought...

Well, maybe...


You?
Of course. Why not me?

Besides, I thought you might find it
entertaining to see me fall down a few times.

Well, it's tempting,

but you seem pretty fit.

Looks can be deceiving.

Okay, fine. Go rent some skates

and I'll see what you got.
Wonderful.

[sighs deeply]

Oh.
[chuckles]

You look like you've
done this before.

Uh, some, when I was
a young lad back home.

exactly is "back home"?

[grunts softly and stutters]

Just a small little
berg outside of Belgium.

Uh, lovely place of
no real consequence.

And does this berg have a name?

Ooh. Well, yes, of course.

Of course it does.

question, how am I doing?

Uh, it's harder than
you remember, huh?

Considerably so.

Well, do you think I
have what it takes?

If I can train a
ten-year-old, I can train you.


Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[both chuckle]

Sorry. I'm a bit wobbly.

You seem fine.
No, no, no, trust me. I'm,

I'm shaky.

Uh, maybe if you hold my hands.

I can't believe you.


Now don't let go or I'll fall.
[royal music]


Come on.

[indistinct chatter]


You're a natural.

Oh, I'm going backwards.
- [both chuckles]

Stand up taller.
Oh, yes.

Put your right foot forwar

Keep holding my hands.
There you go.

[indistinct chatter]

And he just showed up
completely unannounced?

Yeah. I can't believe my mom's so
free with my personal information.

No. She means well.

She always has her nose in my business.
[chuckles]

I told you he likes you.

[gentle music]

He's a bold one.
And single.

Okay, you and my mom would make the perfect pair.
[chuckles]

Tell me one thing you
don't like about him.

Give me a second.
Uh-huh.

That's what I thought.

[both chuckle softly]

[door closes]

[Abigail sighs]

her first little costume.

I sewed the whole thing myself.
[John] Really?

That's amazing.

You did this all by yourself?
Yes, I did.

And it wasn't easy, either.

All those tiny little
sequins and rhinestones.

[John] May I?
[Carol] Mm.

[Carol] Well, thank you.

[chuckles]
[Abigail] Mom?

What's going on here?

Well, after class today, I ran
into your mother at the market.

Then she asked me
how I was getting on.

And he told me he didn't have
any plans for this evening.

So, well, I thought I would
invite him here for dinner tonight

so we could all get
to know him better.

Ah, I can leave
if it's a problem.

No, look, I'm sorry. I'm...

I'm just surprised to
see you. That's all.

Well, then it's settled.


I'm going to go help your
father in the kitchen.

Oh, no. Is he making another one
of his Christmas surprise specials?

Well, you know your father,

he never misses a chance to
play around in the kitchen.

[both chuckle]
Oh, no, not again.

[Carol] I wonder what he'll whip up tonight.
[chuckles]

You're seriously gonna
regret doing this.

what an incredible athlete you are.

[chuckles softly]


Do you feel like you...

didn't live up to
your full potential?

You have no idea.

[chuckles softly]


Yeah.

I have moments like that.

And then you made
them your life's work.

Yeah.

It's reduced to only work.

If your work is your love,

then you'll never work again.

Shakespeare?

Fortune cookie.

[both chuckle]


Your father's candy cane cheeseburger casserole.
[chuckles]

I warned you.

[soft music]

Oh! Tell us, John, what do
you like to do with your time?

Oh, um...

Well, to be honest

I don't really have
a lot of free time.

I've always been
kept pretty busy.

With?

My duties.

Oh, uh, but it's all boring.

Oh.

I saw a poster of the Christmas
Ice Parade yesterday at Al's Diner.

What's that about?

Each year, Abbie's students

put on a holiday show for the town.
[John] Really?

Maybe I arrived just in time.


Last night was the Annual
Holiday Winter Festival party

and tomorrow is our
Christmas Food Bank Drive.

Saturday, Abbie's students

will present this year's
Christmas Ice Parade.

I see.

Are you a part of the show?
[Abigail] Uh...

No. It's showcasing the students.
[John] Oh.

Well, uh, are there any
tickets still available?

Uh, yeah. All you could want.

Uh, you know, kids, I
ordered dessert today.

But I didn't have
time to pick it up.

Oh, well, not a problem.

I could take a trot...

Oh.
over to Al's and pick something up.

Shouldn't take long at all.

What a splendid idea, isn't it, Abbie?
[chuckles]

Yeah, splendid.

Hmm. Well, now the
two of you hurry along

and Dad and I will take
care of cleaning up here.

Me?

You want me to go too?

Yes. Someone has to carry the
dessert while John's driving.


[doorbell chimes]

[ambient music
playing over speakers]

Hey, good evening, folks.
Good evening, Al.

Have a seat at the end. I'll
be with you in a minute.


[indistinct chatter]

[Al] All right? Careful with that, it's hot.
[man] All right.

Here.
[Abigail] Thanks.

[exhales sharply]

Watch that.

Hey, what can I get you two?

I got some great drink
specials this evening.

Oh, no, thanks. Uh, we're
here for a to-go order.

Just a quick dessert
or something.

I got some cupcakes
cooling off in the back.

I can frost up a few if
you gimme a few minutes.

That would be great.
Could you spare four?


By tomorrow afternoon,
I'm gonna need 400.

So, hey, what's a few
cupcakes among friends, huh?

Wait, I'm sorry. 400 cupcakes?
You're joking, right?

No, that's what my
mom was talking about.

The Christmas Food Bank Drive.

All the local merchants put together
holiday boxes to help those in need.

Yeah, but 400 cupcakes
in that small kitchen.


Goes faster and easier if
you have a little help.

You can count me in.
[chuckles]

Oh, right. Um, I'd be
very happy to lend a hand.

[Al chuckles] Great.

See you guys tomorrow. 9:00 am.
[John] Yes.

Well, it looks like you'll know
where to track me down tomorrow.

Ha-ha. Very funny.

So do I get to call you Abbie,
now that we're coworkers?

Oh, now who's being funny?


Look,

I really like you, Abbie,

and I'd like you to like
me if you think you could.

And how do you
suggest I do that?

Well, I was thinking...

If it were up to me...

[soft piano music]

I'd ask you to dance.

Dance?

With you? [chuckles] What, here?

Darling,

can you think of a better time?


[chuckles softly]

[chuckles softly]

[chuckles softly] I haven't
danced in a long time,

so, sorry if I'm stepping
all over your feet.

Come on, don't be silly.

You're doing great.

As any champion skater would.

[chuckles softly]

Normally, I don't like flattery,

but, for you, I'll
make an exception.


Abigail Simpson.

Out on the town two
nights in a row.

[mischievous music]
Um, John, this is Chad.

We went to high school together.

Oh, yes, I saw you last
nighght at the party

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I
saw you there with Abbie.

Nice to meet you, officially.

Your order's ready.

We were just leaving.

[exhales


I'm sorry.

Maybe I can call you tomorrow
and we can talk then.


[melancholic piano music]

[Keep the change.
Enjoy. s]

Can I ask, what
was all that about?

Look, my parents are waiting.
We should probably go.

Right, if you say so.

I do.

[doorbell chimes]

[birds chirping]

[sighs happily]

[gentle Christmas music]

breakfast is almost ready.

Oh, I can't, I'm in
a bit of a hurry.

Oh, and why is that?

I just have to do
something before class.

Something important?

the diner to help Al.

He's up to his ears
with the cupcake orders.

Just you?
Mom, please.

sweet that you're helping out.

Well, it's the least I could do.

And you were right about
John. He is a nice guy.


I just thought the two
of you might hit it off.

I figured that.

Well, did you?

Did I what?
Did you hit it off?


[chuckles softly] Bye, Mom.

Have fun.
But thank you.

[birds chirping]

Hey, Janet,

I've been thinking about what you
said and I think you're right.

Yes. [chuckles] I know.

Okay, so I'm gonna need you
to write this down. Ready?

[Abigail sighs]

Hey, Al.
Hey.

Good morning, Abbie. [chuckles]

Hey. What do you need me to do?

Well, uh, if you can
get these frosted up,

I'll put another batch in the oven.
You got it.

By the way,

I really appreciate this

and so will all the families.

Of course, I'm happy to help.

Sorry my assistant
didn't show up.

hasn't shown up?


Hey, you're here.

I was just taking out the trash.
I've been here for at least an hour.

What kept you?

Well, I...

Okay, you two.

Here are your piping bags.

You know what to do.

I'll put another
batch in the oven.

Aye, aye, Captain.

You ready?
All right.

[gentle Christmas music]

Yes. I'm gonna do the bottom.

Oh! [chuckles]

I'm not as good as I
thought I would be.

doing great. Yeah.

Uh. Get off my cupcake.
[laughing]

Which one are you doing next?
I'm gonna go for this one.

[John] This one?
[Abigail] No.

[chuckles]
I have to go first.

You can't mess up the design.

Oh!

Not too bad for a city boy.

Ah. I was, I was about to say the same thing about you.
[laughs]

You didn't have to help
out. I really appreciate it.

Of course, I did.

Beginning to feel really
invested in this town

Starting to like
it here very much.

Hey, sorry to break up
this little love fest.

We got five more
trays to get to, guys.

You got it.

[Christmas music
playing in the distance]

[indistinct chatter]

Merry Christmas.
[woman 1] Hey.

Please, have some fresh food.

[Larry] Hi.
Can I get you anything?

[indistinct chatter]

Merry Christmas.
[man 1] Merry Christmas. Thank you.

Merry Christmas. Oh.
Okay. Thank you.

Okay.
[chuckles]

This is amazing. Thank you
again for asking me to do this.

I, I feel like I'm a part of
something really meaningful.

Well, you are.

That's what Christmas is
all about here in Evanston.

We try to give back
as much as we can.

Well, I can see why.

This, this is really special.

You know, when I first met
you, I was really upset, but...

I think I was wrong.

Well, I did ruin your cake.

[chuckles] - No, I was
just having a rough day

and I shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

I think we have that part
sorted out and for the better.

Thank you.

And, Abbie, I've, I've really
enjoyed getting to know you.

Well, I'm glad you're
getting what you wanted.

Y... You know, you can too.


Yeah. I mean...

Look, I really love my school,

but I just don't know
how to salvage it.

[woman 2] Thank you.

[gentle music]

I think you could turn it around

if you really tried.

You just have to go for it.

You know what to do.

That's what Janet says.

And she's always right.

We'll see.


Merry Christmas.
[woman 3] Thank you.

Hey. There you go.

[boy 1] Thank you.
Yeah.

[both giggling]

This is for you.
You need some help?

Oh, yeah. Sure.

Hey, bud.
Here you go.

[boy 2] Hello. Merry Christmas.
Oh, this is so much fun.

And where upon earth is Al?

He should be here.

We're only here because
of his hard work,

and I feel guilty, like,
we're taking all the credit.

Oh, I'm sure he's
around here somewhere.


[woman] Oh!
Merry Christmas.

[Christmas music]
Who wants presents?

Me.
Me.


That guy loves Santa.

All right.

He does it all for the kids.

[with deep voice] Have you
two been good this year?

Oh, I'll plead the Fifth
on that one, Santa.

No, I, I don't know. I'll
find out Christmas morning.

Thanks for helping out, guys.

Merry Christmas.

Doesn't he make a great Santa?
In fact, he does.

I'm beginning to see why
people come to Evanston

and stay.

Did you get that?

Got it.
[camera shutter clicks]

Over there? Mm-hmm?
[clicks tongue]


[camera shutter clicking]

Mr. Curtis, what's up?
[Curtis] ...okay?

Oh. [chuckles softly]

Uh, good morning, Abbie.
Uh, we're just taking

a few pictures of the building.

A few pictures? Why?

Well, as I told you, the,

the owners of this
property are thinking of

converting this place
into something else.

But this is my space.

For the moment.

[door opens and closes]

luck with your show.

I hope you sell out.

Yeah, me too.

[upbeat music]

There's no class today.
Oh, I know.

I was just hoping to swing by
and pick up a few pointers.

Wanna come skate with me?

Oh, come on. I'll
let you hold my hand.

Well, how can I say no?

Morning.
Good morning, Mr. Denucci.

I'd like to rent a pair of skates.
Same again?

Same again.
I remember, size ten.

And I'd like to
keep the tab open.

You might consider
buying a pair.

Might be cheaper.

Probably. I'll think about it.

Have a great day.
You too.

[payment machine beeping]

[John] Like this?
[Abigail] Yeah. Keep going.

[gentle music]

[gentle Christmas music]

Okay. So, you guys
have all worked so hard

to prepare for this year's
show, and, honestly,

I think it's our best one yet.

Sadly, our ticket
sales have been low,

mainly to all of our
friends and family,

and I think we all can
do a little bit better.

[gentle music]
I mean, I can do better.

And I wanna do better
for all of you.

So with that said, and a
little friendly persuasion,

I have decided to
lace up my skates

and perform with you guys this year.
[applause]


Now, some people think that's going to
boost ticket sales, I'm not so sure,

but Lord knows we can use
all the help we can get.

It'll be A Cameo on Ice.

Got them.



Wow. Abbie, if this doesn't fill
the space, then nothing will.

People love a comeback story.

And you're an all-town's
favorite. What's not to love?

Mm-hmm.
[John] Abbie, this could put your school on the map.

I've been telling her the
same thing for weeks now.

But no, it takes someone like you to
come along to finally convince her.


Okay, so we have the posters.

Now what?
Now we go out

and start putting them out
where people can see them.

Make sure you take all
the old posters down

and don't forget to thank everyone
for letting us put these up.

You won't be sorry.

You'll see.

What do I have to lose?

Exactly.

on. Let's get going.

That looks pretty good, right?

Yeah, I think so.


Brings back a lot of memories.

Thanks for that.

Well, I didn't do anything.

[gentle music]
Yeah, but you did.

You made me start
believing in myself again.

All the self-doubt and
disappointment, all for nothing.

Thanks to you.
Well, good.

Let's celebrate then.

Dinner tonight at Al's.

And maybe we can finish
that dance we started.

I would love that,

but I'm in training mode right now and
I don't think my coach would approve.

But your coach won't take
no for an answer. at,

Well, it sounds like my
coach has made up his mind.

I made up my mind the
first time I ever saw you.

Then I guess that's a yes.


at last.

Oh, dear me.

goodness I found you.

did you manage it?

You shouldn't have used your
credit card to rent those skates.

And I remember the name on the business
card you presented me last week.

Your Highness, your guy
here is very persuasive.

He said it was an emergency.

An emergency?

Well, your mother has
been worried sick.

How ever could you tell?

Highness, she is the Queen.

The Queen? The Queen of what?

The Queen of the Kingdom
of Donegal, Miss.

The Queen of Donegal?

Wait, the little berg
outside of Belgium?

Wait, if your mother's the
Queen that makes you, uh...


Prince John Lackland.


I'm kind of occupied
at the moment.

Can we talk later at the hotel?

Your Highness, I am under
the strictest orders

not to leave your side until
you are back at Donegal.

Well, I'm sorry, Marshall.

Regretfully, that
is a royal command.

But...
Yes.

As you desire, sir.


I'm kind of freaking
out right now.

Abbie, I can
explain all of this.

No, don't explain anything.
Just tell me the truth.

Uh...

Yes.

It's true. I'm a, I'm a prince,
but a very minor prince.

There's no such thing
as a minor prince.

I don't know what your thoughts are,

but this ice rink would make a beautiful
sports facility for your new franchise.

What? This ice rink?

Yeah, the Prince's new
professional hockey franchise.

The Evanston Monarchy.

what this is all about.

You're trying to buy this ice
rink for your hockey team?

No, no. I didn't know that this was the
building that Mr. Blake was looking at.

You're the one that's trying
to put us out of business.

No, absolutely not.

Believe me, Abbie, I didn't know
he was trying to buy this building.

You have to trust me.
Trust you?

How could you do this?
I thought you liked me.

But I do. Abbie, I, I do.

More than anyone ever before.

You have a funny
way of showing it.

I never wanna see you again.

That could have gone better.

[breathing heavily]

Good evening, Your Highness.

I hope you're happy doing
my mother's bidding.

I've made a real mess of things.

Don't be disheartened,
Your Highness,

it's really not all that bad.
[sad music]

By tomorrow, we could
be back in Donegal,

surrounded by the joyous
celebrations of the holiday season.

A... All of this
will be forgotten.

Forgotten?

A... Are you out of your mind?


I finally met someone.

I met someone I care about.

Now, it's ruined. Sh...
She thinks I lied to her

and I plotted to put
her out of business.

You mean you didn't
tell her who you were?

Well, no, not exactly.

But I never lied about it.

I just didn't want
the royal trappings

to get in the way of
something special.

And the further
along it went...?

Deeper the rabbit hole.


I never dreamt I'd
meet someone like her.

Certainly I didn't think I'd fall
this hard for anyone, but I did.


And now it doesn't
matter anymore.

How can I even think of starting my
new project here in Evanston now?

Your Highness, there are
plenty of other small towns.

No, but this one's perfect.

And it has the one thing
that I've been looking for.

The girl I love.

[gentle music]


I guess that's done now.

If that's true, then perhaps it's time
for us to return home without delay.

I'm sure Mr. Blake can find
another suitable location

and you can begin fresh
after the new year.

If you stay, it's only
going to be worse.

And we still have your
mother to contend with.

I'm sorry, Marshall.

I'm not leaving until
I speak with Abbie.

But I thought you
said it was over, sir.

Very well may be.

But there's always a slight
chance of righting the ship.

I want you to make
a call for me.

Here's what I want you
to do. Don't mess it up.

[lively piano music]

[woman 3] Oh, well...

That was good.
[man 2] It was fantastic.

[exhales sharply]

[music volume increases]

[muted dialogue]

[doorbell chimes]

find you here...

drowning your sorrows
in a milkshake.

[melancholic music]

So you heard.

Imagine that.

A real-life prince
right here in Evanston.

Wow.

And he was your boyfriend.

Well, that ended
well, didn't it?

Don't count me in on that one.

I wouldn't have sent
him packing so quickly.

Not at least without
hearing what he has to say.

But I do have some good news.

I heard that TV Six,

all the way from Lock Valley

is going to cover the
Christmas Ice Parade.

We'll be on TV.

This could be huge
for the school.

Well, if Prince
John had his way,

my school would
already be shut down.

Think the TV folks would
still be interested in us

if they find out the
real star of the show

is on his way back to his
own little private kingdom?

Oh, stop.

They're not coming to see him.

They're coming to see you.

Well, maybe they're coming to see him a little, but who cares?
[chuckles softly]

Look, I'll get us a table where
people will sign up for lessons.

Everyone is going
to be so anxious

to learn how to skate
after they see you perform.

Thanks.

Look, you've really
done a great job.

[sighs deeply]

If only...
If only you weren't so miserable?

[Janet sighs]

Are you sure you and the
Prince are really through?

Seems to me like you guys
were just getting started.

Yeah, I mean, it
happened so fast.

It felt like my
head was spinning.

You say anything
that you regretted?

Honestly, I don't even
remember what I said.

Something like, "Get
outta my life forever,"

or words to that effect.
[chuckles]

You think maybe you
overreacted just a little bit?

I mean, maybe if you two sat
down and hashed things out.

He's probably halfway
back to Donegal by now.

That's where he belongs.
Back in the spotlight

and in front of his
adoring subjects.

Wow.

You're a real sorehead.

Huh. Do you blame me?

I mean, he made me look foolish
like a love struck school girl.

I really thought
that he liked me.

Are you so sure that he doesn't?

I mean, guys can be funny.

They're, they're hard to read.

Listen, you are never going
to know how he really feels

about you unless you give
him a chance to explain.

I don't even think I could
do that if I wanted to.

[doorbell chimes]

Well, you're about to find out.

Abigail.

Uh, let me guess, my mother
told you where I was.

Uh, no, I figured
this out on my own.

Oh,

my apologies. Do you mind?

Oh, no, no. Not at
all. Absolutely.

Um, I will, uh, just go
help Al clean up a bit.

Thought you'd be
on a plane by now.

No, not yet.

I'm not leaving until you
hear what I have to say.

[soft piano music]

Well, I guess I can't stop you.

[Janet very softly] Oh, my goodness.
[John sighs]

Listen, Abbie,

I know I should have told
you about myself earlier.

But when I first got here,

I was just trying to
have a look at the town

to see if it might be a
suitable place for us to settle.

Yes, we were looking for a
building to house our team.

But I had absolutely no idea

that Mr. Blake was
looking at your building.

It's just one of many
properties that he controls.

There are other ice rinks
that are just as good,

and I promise I would never
put you out of business.

Then why didn't you come
clean about who you were?

Do you think I was

in for your money or
your social status?

Do you really think I'm that shallow?
[John] No.

Oh, absolutely
not. Of course not.

I'm so sorry.

[exhales and stutters] I just
didn't think it mattered.

I mean, the further
along things went,

the less I cared about
that part of my life.

Prince John, it, it,
it became a liability.

I don't know, a title that
could just trip things up.

I kind of like just being
run-of-the-mill John.

Yeah, well, I did too.


Don't let us end this way.

We've come this far...

and I never thought that
I'd say this, but...


I love you,

Ms. Abigail Simpson.

And I believe that
you love me too.


With how things ended, I mean,

we're so far apart,
it's not even funny.

You think so?

Sometimes opposites do attract.

But do they live
happily ever after?

In fairy tales, they do.


Another shot at the gold.

Can't we just hit
the reset button?

Start over?

We deserve a try, don't we?

And how do you
propose to do that?

Well, first,

there's a dance that we
never got a chance to finish.

[light emotional music]

It's time.

Come on.

[both giggles]

Yeah.

[indistinct chatter]

[lively Christmas music]

[cheering and applauding]

[audience continues
cheering and applauding]

[music volume increases]


[cheering and applauding]

I love it.


Hope you're ready,
'cause the audience

is totally fired up
for tonight's show.

Ticket sales went
through the roof.

You good?
[sighs] I don't know.

I mean, my stomach's in knots, my legs
feel like rubber and I'm scared to death.

But besides that...

How do we look?
Amazing.

Like a million bucks.

[gentle music]

Oh, my apologies.

Two million bucks.


Do you really think
this is a good idea?

I mean, what if I fail?

You're not going to fail, Abbie.

The girl who lacks confidence
didn't shohow up today.

The girl who showeup today
You'ris a champion. fail, Abbie.

And d champions do
wh they always do.

They win.

[audience cheering
in thehe background]

Thway you say that makes
me want to bieve you.

Do you rlly think so?

Darlin I know so.

this year's Ice Parade,</i>

<i>- we have a very special guest star...</i>
[sighs deeeeply]

<i>a return to the
spotlight after so many</i>

[cheering and applauding]

Yeah!

[dramatic music
playing over speaks]

They're playing your song.

Oh, boy.

[exhales sharply]

I can't thank you enough for
finally breaking through to her.

I mean, this could
change everything.

I truly hope so.
[both chuckle]

Now, if you'll excuse me.

[gentle music]

[dramatic music]

[audience cheering
and applauding]

[audience cheering
and applauding]

Yeah!

Oh!

[audience exclaiming]

[cheering and applauding]

Looks like you got things all
sorted out, Your Highness.

Indeed, I have Mr. Blake.

Indeed, I have.

And it looks like we'll be looking
for a new piece of property then.

That's if you are
planning to stay.

I trust you'll find something
we can all agree on.

Now, gentlemen, if
you'll excuse me,

there's one more thing

I need to take care of.

I don't know what that is.

I think we are
about to find out.

[music continues]

[cheering and applauding]

[uplifting music]

Whoo! Yeah!

Whoo!


ladies and gentlemen,

<i>it seems as if we have</i>

<i>one last Christmas
treat for all of you.</i>

<i>A closing duet featuring Abigail
Simpson and her very special guest,</i>

<i>His Royal Highness Prince
John Lackland of Donegal.</i>

What're you doing out here?

You're crazy.

Yes, I'm crazy.

Crazy in love.

[audience cheering
and applauding]

This is insane.


Listen, Abbie,

sometimes you, you just
have to take a chance.

What do you say, you and I...

Shall we give it a go?

How could I say no?

[sighs in relief]

Thank you for everything.

I don't even know what to say.

Don't say anything.

You, you've done it right.

[exhales sharply] And now
it's your time to take a bow.

[audience cheering
and applauding]

[uplifting music continues]

Miss Abigail Simpson...

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

[Larry and Carol] Ow!

[Al giggles] Yeahah!

Whoo!

Yeah! Yeah!


[audience applauding]

[soft happy music]
