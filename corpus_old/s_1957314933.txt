It's long,
but I'ma speed it up.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

DIRECTOR: And action.

We meet at the restaurant
she work at.

I was with
my community leader, Jonathan.

This very ratchet
and very Black woman

comes to take our order.

And listen, I know that they supposed
to be flirtatious and everything,

<i>but not like she was.</i>

I'm a Christian. I fear God.

<i>So we exchanged numbers.</i>

The next day, she called me
and she's like,

"I'm a ex dancer. I'm broke.
I need welfare."

And I told her, I don't fuck
with that life no more,

and she's like,
"Well, who do you fuck with?"

I was like, "I fuck with
Jesus, my Lord and savior."

I told her that my good
friend Abegunde Olawale,

who a promoter in Tampa,

had invited me
and my boyfriend to Tampa

to be his guests
for the weekend.

And she was like,

"Let me dance at the club
he promote at."

And I was like,
"Is that how that works?

"'Cause I don't know
how that work."

In Tampa, the club don't let
her dance 'cause she dirty.

But everybody loved me.

Reason to be a jealous bitch
number one.

So she takes
all these pictures

and she pops off
a Backpage ad.

<i>And I was like, "Backpage ad?"
Like, what is that?</i>

At the hotel,
I stay with her

because I'm worried
about her safety.

She wasn't getting any calls,

so she puts my picture up with her
picture, and she ain't even ask.

I was very put off.

Nobody liked her.

She made $1.

Everybody loved me.

Reason to be
a jealous bitch number two.
