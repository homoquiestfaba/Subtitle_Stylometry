879

880 
Rachel 

881 
good morning. 

882 
think I have Dex should marry? 

883

884 
I'm serious. 
think it's a good ideea? 

885 
I mean 
nobody knows me like you. 

886 
and you're the one hand as Dexter. 
and you're smarter than me. 

887 
I mean a little list 
in every way, but ... 

888 
I'm trying to say is ... 

889 
I would not do something stupid, right? 

890 
Darcy?! 

891 
I mean no, 
because ... 

892 
I think that really 
I make a nonsense ... 

893 
that I want, really want it. 

894 
and what the vee me! 
what? 

895 
saves what I mean. 

896 
I knew no one like me. 

897 
because ... 
I do not let good things for me. 

898 
which is a kind of truth 
because I've always thought that all 

899 
be solved, as always. 

900 
so I do softer 
and makes me heavier, or something. 

901 
make sense? 
have. 

902 
in the good way. 

903 
and what you said you in your 

904 
I felt it. 
especially when you said ... 

905 
more accurate which is what you said? 

906 
life would be unimaginable without. 
yes. 

907 
because I'm not to get married. 

908 
I think ... 

909 
if? 

910 
you must marry. 

911 
I love you. 

912 
I love Darcy. 

913 
You're the best friend in the world. 

914 
then it is okay if you 
somehow I have horns? 

915 
what? 

916 
I did it just once. 

917 
with whom? 
well ... 

918 
work was a boy 
and it was not only sex. 

919 
and I felt horrible. 

920 
then this is good? 
if? 

921 
because I did not and Dex 
love from before July 4th! 

922 
I got so happy estopy 
this off my chest. 

923 
I hate feeling guilty 
hate 

924 
I feel much better now. 

925 
or God! 
so when are you gonna say? 

926 
I want to tell you? 
I would love decircelo. 

927 
is not your thing. 

928 
I told her to marry. 
so I go out outside. 

929 
Rachel, just say I'm cheating! 

930 
you wanted your chance, so 
to take it. 

931 
ne understand how 
leave it to win always. 

932 
I do not understand. 

933 
Ethan! Ends. 

934 
wow! 
no, nothing like wow! 

935 
because the cards are turned back 
you really think she'd let you win? 

936 
want to stop? 
what about you two? 

937 
do not hate! 
I hate the fact that always beats you at every turn. 

938 
that you hate so much? 
you speak? 

939 
so that you do? 

940 
that you let you win? 

941 
that this is what 
Darcy does! 

942 
Darcy wins, he always does. 

943 
she sees things, wants and gets. 

944 
Ethan, she got her promotion. 
saves hard it is to enter a building? 

945 
is impossible. 
but she did. 

946 
and their merits! 

947 
these jokes. 
right? 

948 
're not joking? 
seen the letter of the test? 

949 
because I say it? 
Rachel saw the letter of tests? 

950 
I saw that. 

951 
Remember when you ask the 
promotion of Michael Jordan? 

952 
and they sent him four 
letters to her and could not get it. 

953 
teach you many times that letter? 
I can not remember right now. 

954 
and that was his rejection. 

955 
really think if it was accepted 
the letter also raised Havia? 

956 
Rachel, come on. 

957 
never had his name on the letter. 

958 
Rachel! 

959 
OK, look what I understand. 
this is hard because you want to party. 

960 
but you have to do something with Rachel. 
because has been totally cowardly. 

961 
and if part of your heart, I have 
hit some punches. 

962 
or probably going to paste. 
I have to get to work, I'm taking. 

963 
I know! Rachel that is the point 
late 

964 
better now, just 
at least take a decision. 

965 
Rachel! 
 going to hell in every way. 

966 
at least do something 
for you once. 

967 
Rachel deserve to be happy. 

968 
Stop that now! 
this would make me happy. 

969 
I'll give my own account. 

970 
or, that's wonderful. 

971 
Let me know if it works! 

972 
surfing is cool! 
that pretty. 

973

that's true. 

974

1173 
I did. 
or, my God I can not hear Rachel 

1174 
this "Dad hit me because I do not like 
my stuff more " 

1175 
this is me being empathic 

1176 
Darcy always thought it was .. 

1177 
who took my things, but it was 
I who gave it. 

1178 
Darcy and possibly ... 

1179 
whatever it is ... 
is not Darcy. 

1180 
but she is my best friend. 

1181 
and I want to be there 
for her.
