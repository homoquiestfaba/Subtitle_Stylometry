(CROWD CHEERING,
STOMPING IN UNISON)

Yeah. We got this.

MAX: <i>...here at
the MGM Grand tonight, Roy.</i>

<i>And, you know, when Adonis Creed
lost to "Pretty" Ricky Conlan,</i>

<i>he was really a curiosity
more than anything else.</i>

<i>But that was an epic fight,</i>

<i>and since then, he's reeled
off six straight wins,</i>

<i>and tonight attempts against
Danny "The Stuntman" Wheeler</i>

<i>to become the heavyweight
champion of the world.</i>

<i>It bears mentioning that Creed
actually wagered his Mustang</i>

<i>before their
sparring session, Roy.</i>

ROY: <i>And rumor has it that same
Mustang is on the line again tonight.</i>

DURAN: Okay, everybody out.
Let's go.

Hey.
Hey.

Feel good?
Mmm-hmm.

Yeah. Remember to
keep your right hand up, okay?

His left is just as strong
as his right.

Yep.
Yeah.

Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm. Okay, good.

It's just another fight, okay?

You got this.

ROCKY: You know, there's only
three steps into that ring.

Just three.

And tonight, it's gonna
look as high as a mountain.

And when you climb
through them ropes,

it's gonna be the loneliest
place in the world

because you're gonna be
in there with another fighter

who wants to take you out.

So now,
you gotta ask yourself,

are you here to prove
something to other people

or prove something
to yourself?

ADONIS: To myself.

Right.

Now, let me ask you something.

What?

What's with the hair?

I combed it.
It's a special night.

Shouldn't you be thinking
about something else, wise guy?

(ADONIS EXHALES)

Now, you can go prove it.

Now go get your Mustang back.

(CROWD CHEERING)

MAX: These guys have really been
mixing it up here in the fourth.

So far, Creed's youth
outweighing Wheeler's experience.

Let's go! Let's go, baby.
Let's o!

MAX: Maybe the most amazing part
of Adonis Creed's journey, Roy...

Don't drop that guard! Sit.

MAX: ...is that tonight,
he fights...

Keep your hands up!

MAX: ...for the same belt held by
both his trainer, Rocky Balboa,

and his father,
the great Apollo Creed.

(CROWD EXCLAIMS)
Whoo!

MAX: Wheeler seems to be waking up.
We've seen this before, Roy.

When Wheeler smells blood,
he really turns it on.

(HIGH-PITCHED WHINING)

ROCKY: (MUFFLED) Come on back.

(MUFFLED CROWD CHEERING)

(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

Come on, D!

MAX: Three years ago,
that's a knockout.

Wheeler's power just isn't the same,
and no doubt Creed can sense it.

You got him. Stay on him!

MAX: Creed's on a mission,
really pressing the issue now.

And a big left hook
lands flush!

ROY: Creed staying in the pocket, Max.
Moving, not running.

Come on, now!
Hands up! Hands up!

MAX: These two men
are really going at it.

Tell him, Donnie!

ROY: Another left hook
drives Wheeler back.

Come on, baby!

MAX: That was a sneaky little
uppercut on the inside,

and Wheeler's hurt
by that, Roy.

ROY: Yeah, that wobbled
his legs pretty bad.

MAX: Another big shot!
Hold him, hold him, hold him!

ROY: Creed has him
in trouble, Max.

MAX: Wheeler's doing
what he can...

(CROWD CHEERING)
Wheeler is down!

Wheeler has hit the canvas!

Now stay there, boy!

Creed taught you!

Come and give me my keys!

Get up! Come on, baby!

Get up, get up!

MAX: Wheeler, trying to get up.
REFEREE: One!

Stay down!
REFEREE: Two!

MAX: I don't know
if he makes this count, Roy.

REFEREE: Three!

Four!

Five!

Six!

Seven!

Eight!

Nine!

That's it. That's it.

(BELL DINGS)
ROY: And it's over, Max.

No way! Adonis Creed...

Give me my keys!

MAX: ...is the heavyweight
champion of the world.

You know what you just did?

Yeah.

Baby, you know
what just happened?


(ALL CHEERING)

When you think of
where this kid has come from,

the most unlikely beginning
for a fighter, Roy.

Growing up the way he did

to make it to the top
of boxing in this way...

It's unprecedented!

CROWD: (CHANTING)
Creed! Creed! Creed!

MAX: It's one thing to be
the number one contender.

It's a whole other thing
to be champion.

(CROWD CHEERING
AND CONTINUES CHANTING)

MAX: This is the first step to
building a legacy of his own,

and I can hardly wait to see
what's next for Adonis Creed.

ROCKY: Whoa.

I mean, what do you think?


That is beautiful.

Right?
Yeah.

But we gotta hurry up.

I mean, she's about to
get out the shower any second.

Yo, Donnie, why didn't you
tell me about this before?

I didn't know
if I was gonna win.

What's that got to do with it?

I don't know.

Look, just tell me
what I should do.

You get down on one knee.

People still do that shit?

You can always
send her a text.

Come on, Unc,
I'm being serious, all right?

I mean, what did you say?

To Adrian?
Yeah.

It was a long time ago.

We were at the zoo.
It was winter. It was snowing.

Everything smelled fresh.

There was this tiger.
He had snow on its back.

And he's walking in the background.
Okay, I get it. I get it.

Just tell me what you said.

Well, I was getting
to that part.

What I said is...

I asked if she would not mind
marrying me very much,

which is kind of a dumb way
of saying she's my world,

and she made me better
than I deserved to be.

You know?

Yeah.

Listen, why don't you
just turn off your brain

and let your heart
do the talking.

Click.

You'll do good.

Turn my brain off?
Yeah.

Okay.
Mmm-hmm.

All right.
All right.

All right, I'm on it.

Hey, Unc.
Mmm.

You good?

Yeah, real good. Thank you.

Great.
All right.

(SIGHS AND MUMBLES)

(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)

(EXHALES,
WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)




Listen, B.

I know we've been
dating for a few years now,

and it's just something
about us that just click.

I don't know
how to explain it,

but the feeling I get when
you're by my side is a feeling

that I can't live without.

I know I sound crazy, but, look,
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

(MUSIC CONTINUES
PLAYING FAINTLY)

Will you marry me?
(CLICKS)

(MUSIC STOPS)
I'm still hungry, babe,

I don't know why.

Are you for real, D?

Yeah, I'm for real.

No, stop playin'.

I ain't playin'.

You didn't hear any of that?

None of what?

Hmm.

None of what, D?

What did you say?

Nothing that you don't
already know.

Remind me.

I said that I love you,

and that I need you.

D, do you know
what you're doing right now?

I mean, yeah, kind of.

What do you mean, "kind of"?

(BIANCA SCOFFS)

Babe!

I mean...

To keep it real with you, B,

you're the only person

I wanna share my moments with.

So, Bianca Taylor,

will you marry me?

Yo.


Yo. (CHUCKLES)

"Yo"? Is that a yes?
(LAUGHING) Yes.

It's yes?

(SIGHS IN RELIEF)
Yes!

Yeah.

(BIANCA SNIFFLES)

SUPERVISOR: Viktor.

(IN RUSSIAN)

(CROWD CHEERING AND SHOUTING)

(REFEREE COUNTING DOWN
IN RUSSIAN)

(IN ENGLISH) Our boy's
looking good.

I'm sure you heard
the good news.

It's time.

BIANCA: You ever thought
about going back to LA?

Please, you're a Philly girl.

Yeah, I guess,

but it'd be nice
to have more space.

And your mom's out there...

And them labels, too.

Could help me get my
music out to more people.

ADONIS: Hmm.

I don't know, I feel like I've done
everything I could in Philly, you know?

Time ain't exactly on my side,
you know?

ADONIS: Mmm-hmm.

What about Rocky?

Rocky has his life, D.

We gotta start ours.

ROCKY: <i>It's a cold one today,
Adrian, that's for sure.</i>

I tried calling our son Bobby
a few times.

But I'd hang up every time
he was about to pick up

because, to tell you the truth,
I didn't know what to say to him.

What if he's moving on,

and I'm like this chunk of
yesterday trying to be today?

I just don't fit in.

I mean, what am I
supposed to do?

Knock on his door and say,
"Hey, how you doing?

"What's it been, a lot
of years?" I don't know.


I miss you.

(LIVELY CHATTER)

(MUSIC PLAYING)
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

You've been hype
ever since you got this jawn.

What are you talking about?

That smile right there.

You're cheezin'.

It's the only thing
my pops left me.

I mean, that and these hands.

(IMITATES PUNCHES LANDING)

You never told me that.
Yeah.

BIANCA: What's up with you
and these secrets, Don?

(ALL EXCLAIM AND CHEER)

ADONIS: How're you doing?
All right, all right.

WOMAN 1:
But look at this, here.

ROCKY: How you doing?
WOMAN 2: Hey.

Hey, Isabelle.
Hey, Rock.

Hey, listen. Some big guy's sitting
over there, waiting for you.

He said you'll know who he is.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

MAN: Yo, champ.

You gotta take that fight, man.
Shut this dude up.

No, Wheeler
still talking shit?

It's a little early
for a rematch, bro.

MAN: Hey, turn the TV up.

COLIN: (ON TV) <i>...and the tragic
history that connects them.</i>

That you?

Nice pictures.

Yeah, they're okay.

No pictures of me.

No, there's no pictures
of that.

Why are you in Philly?

You don't know?

<i>Ukrainian boxer Viktor Drago
appeared today in Philadelphia</i>

<i>to issue
a very public challenge</i>

<i>to recently crowned heavyweight
champion Adonis Creed.</i>

<i>A press conference was held earlier
by boxing promoter Buddy Marcelle.</i>

<i>We came all the way to Philly
to let you know it's serious.</i>

<i>Now, this man here,
he ain't no Danny Wheeler.</i>

<i>And let's be honest, Creed fought
him three years too late, anyway.</i>

<i>Easy match.</i>

IVAN: <i>People in this country
love you.</i>

But Russia,

Drago name.

Everything changed that night.

Look, you know, that's like

a million years ago.

Like yesterday to me.

So, you came all the way
over here to tell me that?

REPORTER: (ON TV) <i>It's no coincidence
that Ivan Drago's son shows up</i>

<i>right after Apollo Creed's son
claims the belt.</i>

<i>This is Creed versus Drago.</i>

<i>This is the fight
the whole world wants to see.</i>

And this is the fight
he should take.

Unless he's afraid of
history repeating itself.

COHN: <i>That history
being the infamous 1985 match</i>

<i>in which boxing legend Apollo
Creed was killed by Russian fighter</i>

<i>Ivan Drago.</i>

<i>Apollo's trainer Rocky Balboa
was heavily criticized</i>

<i>for failing
to stop that fight.</i>

BIANCA: D. Baby.

It's a publicity stunt.

Don't worry about that.

COHN: <i>And let's not forget,</i>

<i>later that year, Balboa defeated
Drago in his own backyard, Russia.</i>

IVAN: <i>Because of you,
I lose everything.</i>

Country.

Respect.

Wife.

You ever see stray dogs
in Ukraine?

They go for days with no food.

People spit on them.
They have nothing.

No home.

Only will to survive,
to fight.

I have son.

All he knows

is this.

My son will break your boy.

Been a long day.

I think we're done here.

Because around here
we put strays away.

(DOOR CREAKS)

IVAN: Hmm.

It's good picture.


I kind of figured
you'd be here.

You know, I tried calling and calling,
but nobody picked up or anything.

Kind of early to be training,
don't you think, after a fight?

Just trying to clear my head.

ROCKY: I get that.

Cheaper than a shrink,
that's for sure.

(CONTINUES GRUNTING)

Hey, Don, come on.
I heard what's going on.

But you can't let them
get inside.

But I know how you're feeling.

Oh, do you?
Yeah, I do.

What happened a long time ago, that
ain't got nothing to do with you.

Listen, that fight is
what Apollo wanted, all right?

It shouldn't have happened.

But it did.

And you gotta let it go.

Come on.


You've seen him fight, though?

I've seen him on sports TV
and stuff like that.

He's big, but he's raw.

He ain't no mean machine
like you are, that's for sure.

You know what?

I'm gonna cheer you up, 'cause
today's gonna be your lucky day.

Christmas just came early
for you,

'cause I'm gonna hold the bag,
lucky guy.

No, you're the one who's lucky.
How's that?

'Cause I'm gonna let you
hold the bag for me.

Yo.

That's it. That's better.

(CROWD CHEERING)

ANNOUNCER: <i>Creed taking major hits.
This could be over soon.</i>

<i>Creed is down!
And he could be badly hurt.</i>

<i>Apollo on the floor
looking unresponsive.</i>

<i>This doesn't look good.</i>

<i>There is no movement.</i>
(GRUNTS)

(GRUNTING SOFTLY)

(R&B MUSIC PLAYING)
(BIANCA VOCALIZING)

BIANCA: <i>â™ª Glitter in
my eyes And I was young</i>

<i>â™ª Know what they say
I ran away from home</i>

<i>â™ª I thank you
I learned the world</i>

<i>â™ª Hoo hoo, yeah</i>

<i>â™ª They think I'm a broken girl</i>

<i>â™ª Hoo hoo, yeah</i>

<i>â™ª I think I'm in love
with lost</i>

BUDDY: Amazing voice.

<i>â™ª My heart cracked
But at least it's touched â™ª</i>

Sorry for the theatrics.

But people like a good show.

That was a grimy move, brah.

Ain't nothing personal.

Can't say I'm proud of
what our sport's become,

but that's the game.

Call it whatever you want.

Sounds to me like
you just trying to get paid.

The money is a side effect.

"The Rumble in the Jungle"
didn't just manifest itself.

Somebody had to
make it happen.

Will it into existence.

Oh, yeah, that's supposed
to be you, huh?

You see anybody else standing
here with a care in their heart?

I want the same thing
you want.

Yeah? What's that?

In the history of boxing,

there have been
77 heavyweight champions.

You know that?

But how many
do you think they know?

Four?

Five?

The belt ain't enough.

You need a narrative. Something
that sticks to the ribs.

Your dad, he knew that.

Do yourself a favor, brah,

and quit while you ahead.

Self-preservation.

At least you got that
over your old man.

That must be Rocky
whispering in your ear.

(CONTINUES SINGING)

I'm serious.

Amazing voice.

BIANCA: Yo, thank you,
Fillmore.

For real though, thank you.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(DOG BARKS NEARBY)

How you doing, kid?

We gotta talk.

Let's take a walk
and get some air.

Okay? Kind of stuffy in here.

Look at that light.

That thing's been broken
for a couple of years.

It's driving me crazy.

City won't fix it or nothing.

What good is a light

that don't light, right?

Kind of funny,
but it's stupid, too.

Hey.

I gotta take the fight.

(ROCKY SIGHS SOFTLY)

Why?

These dudes killed my pops.

Now they're parading around,
talking shit?

I can't let that slide.

I'm the champ, right?


So I ain't got a choice.

Choice?

That's the same thing
your father said,

and he died right here,
in my hands.

Look what his choice
put your mother through.

You don't wanna really bring all
that stuff up again, do you, kid?

I thought you would get it.

If I don't take this fight,
I gotta live with it right now.

That kid was raised in hate,
you know what I'm talking about?

You weren't. Don't do it.

But you did.
It's different.

It was different?

It's a lot different.

I was supposed to be in there
with Drago that night

and not your father.

And I could've
thrown in the towel,

but I didn't.

And I gotta live with that.

And when I did
get in that ring,

that guy broke things in me

that ain't never been fixed.

It's not worth it.

Not at all.

Why do you wanna fight?

What are you talking about?
I just told you why.

No, you didn't, Donnie.

Why do you wanna fight?

I get why
they wanna fight you.

I know what
they're fighting for.

What about you?

Listen to me,
you got everything to lose.

He's got nothing to lose.

When a fighter ain't got
nothing to lose, he's dangerous.

I'm dangerous!

You think I'm gonna lose.

I didn't say that.

Same guy that said he ain't
have enough experience.

Raw, right?
Yeah.

But you don't think
I could beat him.

Is that what you're trying to say?
No.

No, that's not
what I'm saying.

I'm saying
I'm not gonna be here forever.

And what's that
supposed to mean?

That means you gotta
do some smart thinking.

Oh, you wanna talk about
smart decisions, Rock?

You in this house all alone.

Who been taking
care of you? Me.

I've been here for you!

Who else you got?

Listen.

I'm taking this fight
with or without you.

It's gotta be without.

I can't do it.

So that's it?

You walkin' out on me?

At least you ain't gotta worry about
throwing in the towel this time.

Yeah.

Yeah.

(TRAIN CHUGGING)

(DOOR CLOSES)

(DOOR SLAMS)

(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)

(MUSIC STOPS)

BIANCA: D, are you okay?
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

Rocky, man.

Rocky what?

He ain't training me
for the fight.

Wait, you're taking the fight?

All the shit
that we've been through.

He gonna leave me high and dry.
That's bullshit!

I took care of him
when he had cancer.

He could've been dead, B.

I'm sure he has his reasons.

Oh, yeah? Like what?

Like what?


I don't need him.

Yo.

I love it.

Me, too.

I want just a little piece
of that room for a studio.

That works. It's all you.

What's wrong?

I don't know. Maybe I'm just a
little tired from the flight.

I'm okay.

We don't have to go out.

We can just stay in,
order some food.

Hmm. No, baby,
you have to tell her.

(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)

So, how's the music?

Oh, Donnie didn't tell you?

D?

Uh... I forgot.

Oh. Yeah, I signed.

Hello. (EXCLAIMS)

Yeah, it's great. The record label
really hit the ground running, too.

I'm up for festivals
this summer.


Congratulations.
BIANCA: Thank you.


So, how's Rocky?

He didn't wanna make the trip?

Nah, Ma, you know how he is

with the traveling.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Okay, Ma.

I'm sure you already
guessed it, but...

MARY ANNE: Oh, yeah.

I already know.

All the salt,

shiny hair,

glowing skin.

How far along are you?

Mmm?

Ma, you think...

You think...



We couldn't even... No.

Your mamma's got jokes, okay.

(BOTH LAUGHING)
No, I'm not.

All right.

Mmm-mmm.

ADONIS: What's it say?
BIANCA: D, don't touch it.

No, I don't care if you peed on it.
I just want to see...

I don't want you
to mess it up.

What's it say?

It's two blue lines.

Two blue lines?
What does that mean?

Two blue lines.


Maybe it's broke.


That's crazy.


Hell, I don't know, D.

Baby, I don't know.

You did say you always
wanted kids, right?

Yeah, but I didn't say
so soon.

I don't know if I'm...

If we are ready.

Let's get ready, then.

Yeah.


MARY ANNE:
<i>Did she tell her family yet?</i>

She's, uh, on the phone
with her aunt right now.

Oh, that Bianca's a good one.

Why she agreed to marry you,
I do not know.

I don't know either.


Oh, it's good
to have you home.


Ma, um...

That fight

between me

and Ivan Drago's son...

I'm gonna take it.

Okay.

That's it?

What else is there to say?

So, that doesn't bother you?

Oh, you think
this doesn't bother me?

You're a grown man.

It doesn't matter
what I or anyone else thinks.

You wanna fight this man,
that's your business.

You don't need my blessings.

You clearly
don't have Rocky's.

Rocky don't get it.

It wasn't his dad.

It changed my life.

Your life.

You're telling me
you don't miss him?

Excuse me!

Do not try to make this
about me.

And don't pretend
that it's about your father.

You became the world champion
without him.

Then why don't I feel like it?

If your father was here, he would tell
you he didn't feel like it either.

But he's not.

I just hope
you'll be here for your child.

(WATER RUNNING)
(DISHES CLATTERING)

Why are you so stupid?



D, you're tickling me
with that fake beard.

The disrespect.


Why don't you sing for us?

No, I am not your jukebox.

I'm not gonna be walking around
here, barefoot and pregnant,

making you sandwiches either.

Did you hear that?
No sandwiches, no singing.

(BIANCA CHUCKLES)

Your mamma just hating on us.

Did you hear that?

What if the baby can't, D?

Can't what?

Can't hear.

You know it can be
hereditary, right?

Mmm.

Everything is gonna be fine.

I promise.

LITTLE DUKE: <i>People are gonna
be all over this fight.</i>

It got a lot
of bad history, man.

Everything.

Your dad.

And yours, too.

Don't forget
that he trained him.

I know why you didn't
train me before.

I wasn't ready.

You was right.

Yeah, but this is different.

<i>Drago's kid...</i>

<i>Big.</i>

<i>Fast.</i>

Strong.

Unorthodox.

<i>He's a monster, boy.</i>

It's a balanced breakfast
over there.

You think you ready
for all that?

I gotta be.

But if you ain't gonna
do it for me,

at least do it for them.

Think about it.

<i>Beat what they couldn't beat.</i>

<i>Change the way
they were remembered.</i>

(TIRES SCREECH)

This is our chance
to rewrite history.

<i>Our history.</i>
(VIKTOR PANTING)

(IN RUSSIAN)

LITTLE DUKE: <i>His record might
be light, but, believe me,</i>

<i>he ain't no undercard.</i>

So, you gotta be with me.

I'm right here.

We'll see.

We'll see.



MAX: <i>Creed versus Drago.</i>

<i>That means something.</i>

<i>Did that factor into your
decision to take this fight?</i>

I mean, you can't say Creed
without Drago, right?

This is what y'all want.

It's what everyone wants.

MAX: <i>Also, can't help
but to notice,</i>

<i>who won't be in your corner
this time around.</i>

ADONIS: <i>Rocky's taking
some family time.</i>

<i>But Duke's got me.</i>

<i>His father taught my father
everything he knows.</i>

LITTLE DUKE: Speed, D.
That's how we gonna beat him.

ADONIS: <i>Technique, speed...</i>

<i>I'm confident he'll have me
ready for this fight.</i>

MAX: <i>And knowing what happened
between your father and Drago,</i>

<i>you must have some worry.</i>

What would I be afraid of?

I'm a fighter.
This is what I do, right?

LITTLE DUKE: Who the champ?

It's who I am.

LITTLE DUKE: Looking good!

CROWD: (CHANTING)
Creed! Creed! Creed!

(CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

You're much smaller
than your father.

Don't you talk about my pop.

(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

Hey, we could do this
right here, bro.

Step up here!
D!

He can't help you no more!

You hear me? He can't help
behind that ring!

You stand there. All you're
doing is talking, homie.

Your pops can't protect you,
you feel me?

Don't talk about my father!
Don't turn your back on me!

You in my house, homie!


TRAINER: Make sure they hold them down.
We're in the dressing room.

JIM: <i>Jim Lampley here,
along with Roy Jones.</i>

<i>We're moments away
from tonight's main event.</i>

ROY: <i>Jim, I would have never
thought in a million years</i>

I'd witness another
Creed versus Drago fight.

JIM: Well, get ready, Roy.
Drago makes his way to the ring.

His father leads the way
through the hostile crowd.

ROY: You can feel the energy.
I'm sure Creed does.

He has a big advantage
with the fans in his corner.

(TRAINER CLAPPING)

(MUFFLED STOMPING)

LITTLE DUKE: Stay focused. You're
at home, baby. Focus is the key.

JIM: Given Drago's size
and style,

he'll look to use his power
to counter Creed's speed.

LITTLE DUKE: Remember why
we're here, man.

(CROWD CHEERING
AND STOMPING IN UNISON)

I'm the champ.


I'm the champ.


I'm the champ.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC INTRO PLAYING)

(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)

(CROWD CHEERING)

JIM: Adonis Creed making
a grand entrance tonight.

Like his father,
Creed is ever the showman,

and is energizing the crowd.

(CROWD CHEERING)

ROY: Creed is letting Drago know
exactly who this arena belongs to.

JIM: It all feels
so Shakespearean.

Two sons, raised a world apart,
yet inexorably linked by tragedy.

Now, gentlemen,

I went over the rules
in the dressing room.

<i>I wanna caution you to keep
this fight clean at all times.</i>

<i>Protect yourself at all times.</i>

<i>And what I say, you must obey.</i>

Good luck. Touch gloves.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Touch gloves.

JIM: Creed fights without
longtime trainer Rocky Balboa.

Interesting to see
how Duke manages the corner

with so much bad blood
between the fighters.

Look at him.

He think he gonna run
straight through you.

You show him what's up.
Yeah.

This is your house, all right?

It's my house.
Let's go, baby.

(BELL DINGS)
REFEREE: Box!

JIM: And we're underway.

If all goes according to form,

Creed is seen as the more
versatile boxer, quicker...

Yeah, baby, throw that jab!
Let it rip!

JIM: Drago is trying to land
something big.

ROCKY: Dig, dig.

Downstairs.

Creed connects
with a couple of body shots.

(CROWD CHEERING)

And a right hand upstairs
for Creed.

Drago hasn't thrown
a meaningful punch yet.

And another right hand
for Creed.

(CROWD EXCLAIMS)

Creed blocked that punch

and still it knocked him back
into the ropes.

Yeah, we good.

ROY: Creed doesn't
like that, Jim.

Don't be stupid, kid.
He's baiting you.

JIM: Creed pressing now, angrily rushes
forward with a volley of punches.

He's pulling you in.

JIM: A huge left hook
by Drago!

Come on, kid.
JIM: <i>Creed shaken up by that punch.</i>

ROCKY: Clear your head.

JIM: Creed commands
the center of the ring,

but there's a hard body shot
to the ribs.

And another one
on the other side.

What you doing, baby?
What you doing, D?

JIM: And a right hand by Drago
that knocks Creed's head back.

ROY: Creed can feel the power
behind those punches.

And now
Drago is on the attack.

Jab out, jab out, jab out.
Hands up, let's go!

JIM: Drago's stalking him
along the ropes.

Get off the ropes, D!

Out the corner!

No, D! Out the corner,
out the corner!

(BELL DINGS)

JIM: Hard right hand by Drago,
and Creed is shaken

as the first round
comes to a close.

I think most watching at home
are a little surprised

by how impressive
Viktor Drago has looked

in these opening minutes
of the fight.

(SIGHS)
<i>With the history these men share,</i>

<i>Duke may have his hands full
keeping Creed</i>

<i>from letting his emotions
get the best of him.</i>

What you doing, D?

You need to stick with the game plan.
I know, I know.

Stay off the line. Take your angles.
You ain't taking your angles.

I know!

If he throws you
a left hook...

Come on, man,
hold the phone on that.

You think I don't know that shit?
Well, if you know it,

do it!

(IN RUSSIAN)

JIM: And now, as we prepare for round
two, this crowd is still buzzing

from the vicious rally that Drago
brought forth in the last minute

of round number one.

Come out smart.

JIM: Got Creed in serious trouble
as the round came to a close.

(BELL DINGS)
REFEREE: Box!

JIM: And now,
round two begins.

And Drago comes out throwing,
wasting no time.

(CROWD EXCLAIMS)

Get off the ropes!
JIM: And Creed is backed

into the ropes, trying to
avoid those power shots.

Damn.

JIM: Things just got
ugly fast.

And another hard right hand shot,
and Creed is in big trouble now.

Keep moving, Donnie.

JIM: A massive right hand
sends Creed reeling.

He tries to regain
his footing.

Creed trying to answer back.

And now a huge hook sends
Creed flying through the ropes!

Come on, kid.

REFEREE: Two!

Three!

Four!

Five! Six!

That's it,
that's it, that's it.

CROWD: (CHANTING)
Creed! Creed!

You okay?
Yeah.

REFEREE: Box!

JIM: Creed needs something

to try to turn
this fight around.

(IN RUSSIAN)

JIM: Drago just keeps coming.

What a big rib shot!
(CROWD EXCLAIMS)

LITTLE DUKE: Shit.

JIM: Those were two tremendous
right hands to the rib cage.

You could've heard that one
in the nosebleed seats.


Creed clearly in pain,
as he finds a way to his feet.

Not ready to give up yet.

ROY: I don't know. This
is getting dangerous, Jim.

REFEREE: Okay! Come to me!

JIM: And now, Bayless is
gonna let him go again.

REFEREE: Ready?

Box!

JIM: He comes barreling
out of the corner.

Huge right hook!

Drago trying to end it.

(BELL DINGS)

And Creed delivers
a big right hand at the bell.

REFEREE: Get back!
Get back to your corner!

JIM: Bayless restraining
Drago, seemingly frustrated...

REFEREE: Obey my commands.

JIM: ...as he was close
to finishing the fight.

REFEREE: You got to show me something.
If not, I'm gonna stop it.

Can you fight?

Oh, I'm good, I'm good.

Hell no.
I'm calling this fight.

Nigga, don't call this shit.

You ain't got to prove shit
to nobody.

Look at you. Your ribs
look like they broke.

call this fight.

(IN RUSSIAN)

my mouthpiece.


My mouthpiece.

Don't do it.

JIM: Now, as we go
to round three,

Adonis Creed has been
beaten up and bloodied

by an avalanche of power shots

from Viktor Drago
in the first two rounds.

And we'll see how much
Adonis Creed has left now,

as he tries to stay alive
in the fight.

Stop the fight.

ROY: Dangerous swings
from Drago

as Creed desperately tries
to hold him off.

JIM: Drago's still putting
huge pressure on the body.

Come on, stop the fight!

JIM: And another shot
by Drago!

Creed seemingly
on his last legs!

Drago on the attack.
Come on, D!

(CROWD EXCLAIMS)

JIM: Oh, and with a devastating
shot to the rib cage.

REFEREE: Stop! Stop!


JIM: This is an obvious
disqualification, or so it would appear

because Creed was fully down

at the moment that Drago
landed that last shot.

LITTLE DUKE: No!
TRAINER: You wanna kill somebody?

LITTLE DUKE: No way, baby. No!
PADMAN: Easy, easy!

No. No, no, no!
BIANCA: Come on.

LITTLE DUKE: No! Just relax.


JIM: <i>This arena is
completely silent</i>

<i>as the audience waits to see</i>

<i>what will be the condition
of young Adonis Creed.</i>

(EKG BEEPING)

DR. EWELL: Cracked orbital bone, two
cracked ribs, grade-3 concussion,

ruptured kidney,
numerous contusions.

Oh...

A ruptured kidney, is that--

His injuries will heal
with rest and time,

including the kidney.

Now, we shouldn't have
to resort to surgery,

but we will need to keep him here for
at least 48 hours, as a precaution.

Now he's still numb from the morphine,
but he'll certainly feel it later.

Okay.
You okay?

Fine, I just gotta sit.

If you're expecting...

No, I'm fine.

No, no, seriously.
Take it easy, okay?

NURSE: Excuse me, Dr. Ewell.

You have a visitor.
Right this way.

Bianca.

Listen, I'm so sorry
everything went...

I should've been there.

I'm so sorry.

I am.
(BIANCA SNIFFLES)

BIANCA: Me, too.

Is it okay if I see him?

LITTLE DUKE: What difference do it
make to us? We saw what happened.

They doing what they supposed
to be doing.

I don't care.

Right. Okay.

Got it.

WBC's not gonna contest
the referee's decision,

so Viktor
remains disqualified.

Bottom line,

you still the champ.


I'm gonna let you rest, man.

So, if you need something,
you know, I'm outside.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Got some company, D.

(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

(EXHALES HEAVILY)

You did good.

We tried.

You know, I watched you
back in Philadelphia.

You showed a ton of heart.
I mean, there's no doubt about it.

Showed a ton of heart.
Heart? (GRUNTS)

Man, I ain't trying
to hear that shit.

D. It's Rock.

Oh, it's okay.
It's all right.

No, you guys gotta
work it out.

I lost the fight
before it even started, right?

No. No, no.

This guy was...
He's a big guy, he's strong.

He got the reach on you.
He got all kinds of--

Oh, now you're trying
to train me?

Be my coach?

(BREATHING RAGGEDLY)
No, look at me.

Look at me.

What are you still doing here?

Here to pick up the pieces?

ROCKY: No.


Shouldn't you be in Philly?

BIANCA: Adonis.
No, it's okay.

I don't want him to get all...

Take care of each other.

I'm sorry.

(BREATHING RAGGEDLY, GRUNTS)

(GRUNTS)
(PILLS CLATTERING)

(LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS)

BIANCA: I don't know.
Lately, it's like...

He hasn't really been himself.

And I get it.

'Cause he's going
through a lot.

<i>He's just starting
physical therapy.</i>

<i>Trying to get himself right.</i>

<i>And</i>

<i>he's, uh...</i>

<i>distant</i>

<i>and disconnected.</i>

It's like nothing really
matters to him right now.

Including me.

Which is new.

<i>Yeah.</i>

MARY ANNE: <i>Listen, be there
for him, take care of him,</i>

<i>give him your love.</i>

<i>But also, you gotta realize
he's in a place right now</i>

<i>that only he can
get himself out of.</i>

And with everything
he's going through--

MARY ANNE: With everything
he's going through?

You've been in his corner
every step of the way.

<i>He's a grown man.</i>

<i>He's gotta heal
from the inside out.</i>

Trust me, I know.
I've been there.

She's good. She's good.

Good, good, good.

Listen, man, I've been meaning
to hit you up, though.

Commissioner wanna know
who we plan to fight next.

You ain't gotta fight Drago,

but you gotta fight someone.

You gotta defend the belt.

Otherwise,
it's gonna be vacated.

I could set up a little, you
know, tune-up fight, kind of.

No. You know what, man?

Don't worry about
none of that right now.

Listen, just come on inside.

Hit the bag, man, warm up.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm gonna grab my stuff,
and I'm gonna meet you in there.

into that glove.

There you go. Lean in it.

like, a thousand times.

Yeah, it's about the light.

How long?

You want to be specific?
Couple years.

Yeah.

I mean, how many guys does it
take to screw in a light bulb?

I'm not joking.

Can I call you guys back?

Yeah.


Wow.


Hey, Ma.

Ma.

Hey, Ma.

How you doing, kid?

What are you doing here?

I hope you don't mind,

your mom asked if I would come out
'cause she's worried about you.

I am, too.

I'm good.

You didn't have to come
all this way.

By train.

on a train.

It's all right, you know,
gives you time to think.

And you watch all these places
whipping by the windows like postcards.

It's quite an experience.

Yeah, I mean, if you say so.

Yeah, it was nice.

This is wonderful.

How you have
all this out here.

You could have the same.

Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

I mean,
not just the shiny stuff,

but the better stuff.

Have a better life.

Be a better man.

You know, I was thinking about
what you were saying about

what smart decisions
have I made lately.

Couldn't think of many.

You know, I wasn't even there
when my son's son,

my grandson,

was born.

I mean, he's like
that tall now probably.

I don't even know him.
He doesn't know me.

It's pathetic.

Well, why won't you just

call him?

It ain't that easy,
you know...

Listen,

I don't want you making
the same mistakes I made.

You know what I mean?

So, you gotta ask yourself,

what's the valuable stuff?

It's like I asked you before.

What were you
really fighting for?

I was afraid.

Of this.

Expectations.

Being the champ.

I was scared I couldn't do
what he couldn't.

It's weird.

I used to feel like
he was apart of me.

Now I can't hear him,
or that thing,

that thing that tells me
to get in the ring.

Move my feet,
keep my hands up.

Hit anything
that gets in my way.

I can't hear it anymore.

I don't even know how I lost.

Your mind wasn't right.

And your natural style just
won't work with a guy that big.

You saying yours was better?

I won, didn't I?

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Good seeing you, Unc.
Great to see you, too.

I was talking
with your mother,

and she says you came up
with this name for the child.

Amara.
Amara.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Why, what's wrong with that?

No, it's a beautiful name,
but it's kind of complicated.

Why don't you think
about something,

at least I would,
a little simpler to say,

like "Becky" or "Cate,"
something like that.

Cate Creed?

Cate Creed. Two "C's."
Easy to remember.

You do know
she's gonna be black, right?

Oh, that's right, I forgot.

(LAUGHING)
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

Okay.

Hey, Ma.
Yeah.

Wait, right now?

ROCKY: Relax.
ADONIS: Okay.

ROCKY: Everything's gonna be fine.
ADONIS: Mmm-hmm.

ROCKY: You just gotta be there
for her, okay? That's your job.

ADONIS: I got you, I got you.

And remember--
Yeah.

Today is gonna be the best day
of your life. Right here.

All right?
Yeah.

Best day of your life.

(WHISPERS) I'm having a baby.
ROCKY: I feel like I'm having a baby.

MARY ANNE: Boy!
Hey.

MARY ANNE: What you doing?
I know--

No, never mind.
Just get in here.

Okay. Okay, okay.

Like I said,
I'll be here if you need me.

All right.
All right.

You know,
I'm gonna do what I can.

You being here
is more than enough.

Thank you.


(CLEARS THROAT)

(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

Mr. Balboa?

Mmm.
She's here.

Oh, that's great.

That's absolutely good.

That's fantastic.


Hey, Unc, say hi
to your goddaughter.

Wow. That's quite an honor.

Let me see you.
BIANCA: Here she is.

ROCKY: Hey, hello, beautiful.

So, nurse...

Hmm?

...what about the test?

NURSE: Relax for now.

We'll run an auditory exam as soon
as you and Amara get some rest.

It's okay, babe.

Thank God she looks like you.
(BIANCA LAUGHS)

BIANCA: Yeah, right.

ADONIS: So, is she gonna
feel anything?

No, it's painless. I promise.

Okay. Now that
they're in place,

what we're gonna do is give
her a series of click stimuli

around 35 decibels

and check her
neural responses.

Is that loud?

Normal auditory range.

Okay.

Here we go.

So what exactly
are we looking for?

A reading. Spikes.

(MACHINE BEEPING
INTERMITTENTLY)

So, we're not seeing
any waves or spikes, uh,

and given your family history,
there is some cause for concern.

However, it is very early...
(VOICE FADING)

ADONIS: <i>They're gonna run
some more tests.</i>

They said it's early, and, uh,
sometimes they get false reads.

Let me ask you something.

What if it ain't okay?

I can't think like that.

You gotta, I mean,

how you gonna handle it?

Hmm?

I don't wanna go there.

You gonna love her?

How you gonna ask me
a question like that, Rock?

Yeah, I'm gonna love her.
Good.

'Cause she ain't feeling
sorry for herself,

and you shouldn't either.

BIANCA: (CHUCKLES)
You got a little...

Oh, it's boxing gloves.

You got it?
ADONIS: Yeah.

BIANCA: (GASPS) <i>Goodnight Moon.</i>
I love that book.

Who's that from, babe?

VAN PELT: <i>The unanimous number
one contender Viktor Drago</i>

<i>has been met with open arms
back in Russia,</i>

<i>his father's home,
which is nice.</i>

<i>But the question on everyone's
mind is, "Where is Creed?"</i>

<i>If he doesn't choose an opponent
soon, he risks forfeiting the title</i>

<i>and personally, I can't imagine
him being able to live with that.</i>

You good?

Yeah.
Finally got her to settle.

Hey, I need to
get out of the house.

I was gonna
go over to the studio.

You mind watching her
until I get back?

Yeah, of course.

Cool.

Okay, okay.
(AMARA COOS)

Yeah.

You okay?

Yeah, I got it. Yeah.

Okay.

Bye.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

No, no, there you go.

Hey.

I know.

Mmm-hmm. Daddy's
being a bitch, I know.

(BIANCA SIGHS)

Hi.

How'd you do?

She's a fighter.

Just like her dad.

Just like her mom, too.

I have to fight him again.

I don't wanna be that person
to stop you.

But I don't wanna end up
like your mom, alone.

I feel you.

Do you?

And it's not
just us anymore, D.

I know it sounds crazy
doing all this all over again.

But this won't be
the end of me.

Or you.

It can't be, 'cause we a team.

We weren't a team when you
took the fight the last time.

You right.

I'm sorry.

I shouldn't have
put you through that.

Then why?

Why do it again?

What do you have to prove?

It's not about that.

You wouldn't be any good to anybody
if you didn't do what you love.

You wouldn't be
able to breathe, right?

Well, I wouldn't be any good to anybody
if I don't handle this the right way.

But I need you.

Both of you.

(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

I'll beat him.

You better.

ROCKY: You gotta think
about this real hard.

You got people
that need you now.

That's exactly
why I can't lose.

Buddy said the fight
has to be in Russia.

Take it or leave it.

ROCKY: Russia?

On their turf.

So Russia it is.


LITTLE DUKE:
What you think, Rock?

It's a clear advantage if it
comes down to a judge's decision.

Well, then we can't let it get
to a judge's decision, right?

Oh, shit.

Call the promoter.

So we train here tomorrow,
5:00 a.m.

No, I got other plans.

You mean, you wanna go to Philly?
No.

Listen, you wanna
change things in a big way,

then you need to make
some big changes.


ADONIS: You gotta be
messing with me, right?

Heard this is a place
where fighters go,

you know, to start over.

Get reborn.

What took y'all so long?

This some wild shit.

Yeah, sure looks like
hell to me.

Since you're going back to hell,
you might as well get used to it.

Let's go.

Go for it.


Harder.

Harder.

Harder!

Keep going.


Build that neck.



Okay, man up.

No.

I'm good.

That's the fight it's gonna be.
Toe-to-toe. Get used to it.

Box!

Take it to the body.

Take it! Fight the pain.

You all right?

Get back in there.

JIM: Creed looks good tonight,

but it's impossible to forget
what happened to him

the last time he stepped
into the ring with Drago.

Numerous injuries, not least
of all, a nasty broken rib

and a ruptured kidney.

MAX: A huge difference
in this fight

is he's got former champ Rocky
Balboa back in his corner.

And Rocky assures everyone

this fight will be very
different from its predecessor.

(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

(IN ENGLISH) Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen. This is it.

Twelve rounds of boxing

for the heavyweight
championship of the world!

Ladies and gentlemen,

let's get ready to rumble!

(CROWD CHEERING)

MAX: You can feel the nervous
energy in the arena tonight, Jim.

Creed has some courage
to get back into the ring

with a man who nearly
ended his career.

A man who is hungry
to be champ.

REFEREE: Fighters,

(SPEAKS RUSSIAN)

(IN ENGLISH) I want good,
clean fight.

(REFEREE SPEAKS RUSSIAN)

(IN ENGLISH) Break when
I tell you to break.

You go to your corner when I
tell you to go to your corner.

(REFEREE SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

(IN ENGLISH) Touch gloves.

MAX: Rocky Balboa and Ivan
Drago sharing the ring

for the first time
in 30 years.

JIM: If anyone knows how to take on a
slugger like Drago, it would be Rocky.

ROCKY: You know you got
the fire in your gut,

and I know you'll do
what needs to be done.

Because now, you know what
you're fighting for.

(IN RUSSIAN)

MAX: Viktor overwhelmed
Creed's previous game plan,

and I think
it got in Adonis' head.

MAX: It's gonna be interesting to see
how Rocky Balboa has prepared Creed

for what is surely to become
an all-out brawl.

REFEREE: Ready?

Ready?

(DINGS)
Box.

JIM: And we're underway.

MAX: Drago comes out swinging
with two hooks that Creed avoids.

JIM: And a big right-hand
right out of the gate.

Watch that right, Donnie.

JIM: Drago a bit surprised as
Creed shakes that punch off.

(IN RUSSIAN)

MAX: Drago is pressing hard,
but Creed is not backing off.

Keep moving, keep moving.

JIM: Creed working a little
bit closer to Drago tonight.

(CROWD EXCLAIMS)

MAX: That is a vicious
combination by Creed.

JIM: And now a right hand by Drago.
(CROWD CHEERING)

MAX: Here we go,
Drago applying pressure.

Out the corner!
Come on, Donnie!

MAX: Creed manages
to slip away.

Let's get it.

(CROWD EXCLAIMS)
Yeah, what's up?

MAX: Now they're squaring off in
the middle of the ring, toe-to-toe.

Taking blows.

Creed staying in his face.
(BELL DINGS)

And there's the bell! As a wild
first round comes to an end.

REFEREE: Go to your corner.

JIM: Drago frustrated.

Creed is looking like a
different fighter tonight, Max.

That's it, D! That's it!
MARY ANNE: Yes!

Oh, yeah, who's saying
Drago now, though?


ROCKY: See, all that work in
the desert paid off, right?

Yeah, you got him.
You got him thinking.

He wasn't expecting
what you're bringing.

Now, he's gonna bring the heat the
next round, but you're ready for it.

(IN RUSSIAN)

He overextends his right hand.

You gonna counter
with the right

and crack him with the left.
You got that?

Extend the right,
crack him with the left.

He'll never expect it. His old
man did the same thing to me.

JIM: One early observation,
Max.

I think Creed is withstanding
Drago's combinations

much better tonight
than in the first fight.

Box.
(BELL DINGS)

JIM: And round two begins.

MAX: Drago with a huge left hook.
(CROWD EXCLAIMS)

JIM: And a big right hand.

Drago on the attack again, now
driving Creed back into the ropes.

He's overextending the right!
Watch the right!

JIM: A right
and a left for Creed.

(IN RUSSIAN)

(CROWD CHEERING)

JIM: Huge uppercut
has Creed holding on now.

Drago throws him off
into the corner.

Get out of that corner!
Get out of the corner!

JIM: And Drago throws Creed
to the canvas.

(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

What's going on?

MAX: Shades
of the first fight,

but Drago showing restraint
this time.

REFEREE: You good?

Yes, I'm good.
(IN RUSSIAN)

REFEREE: Box.
MAX: Drago explodes from the break.

And Creed is down!

A flurry of heavy shots!

Drago's power
is just incredible.

REFEREE: Three.

Four.

ROCKY: Take the eight count.
Take the full eight.

MAX: Creed taking his time
on the canvas.

REFEREE: Six.

Stay down! Breathe!

MAX: He's listening to Rocky, who
has been in this situation before.

REFEREE: Eight.

JIM: And Creed is back on his feet.
Beats the count.

REFEREE: Ready?
Yeah, let's go.

Box.

Tie him up. Don't fight him.
Tie him up.

MAX: Drago is right back at it.
(BELL DINGS)

(CROWD CHEERING)

JIM: So, with the knockdown and
those hard shots at the end,

that round clearly goes
to Viktor Drago.

And you could just feel
he's gaining momentum.

You knew this was
gonna be a war, right?

You knew that going in there.

From now on,
it's who wants it more,

and who's got more heart.

(IN RUSSIAN)

Don't let him crack you. You stay on
the outside, you're gonna get hurt.

You stay on the inside,
you'll tear him up.

I'm telling you,
it's all about pressure.

If you wanna give pain, you gotta
be willing to take the pain.

(CROWD SHOUTING)

Come on!

Yes!
LITTLE DUKE: Yes!

(IN RUSSIAN)

JIM: Round four
is another brutal display

as Creed takes a lot of
punishment from Drago.

(CROWD CHEERING)

MAX: Drago is not slowing down.
(BELL DINGS)

Landing a big shot
after the bell.

What is your problem?

Yo!

MAX: The violent chess match
continues, Jim.

Oh, and Creed is down again.

Donnie, get up.

MAX: Drago clearly dominating this
fight, but Creed will not give up.

He is taking
a lot of punishment.

ROCKY: You gotta stay
in his face. Look at me.

You gotta stay in his face.

And when you see an
opportunity, you go after it.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

There you are!

Drago is cut now.

MAX: As we enter round eight,

we are deeper into this fight
than anyone expected.

JIM: Creed must sense he's behind.
He's trying to force the action.

Yes, baby!

(BELL DINGS)

MAX: What we are seeing
tonight is Adonis Creed

standing up to the awesome
power of Viktor Drago.

He's not going anywhere.

(IN RUSSIAN)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

JIM: Viktor Drago
looks tired, Max.

Keep in mind, he's never had to go past
the 4th round in a professional fight.

(ADONIS GRUNTS)

Hey! What was that?
Take the point, ref!

JIM: And Drago drops Creed

with two nasty body shots.
Come on!

He held him and hit him.
REFEREE: One.

MAX: Viktor holding and maybe
getting away with something there.

The ref must not have seen it.

(SIGHS)
(DINGS)

Come on.

MAX: I think Rocky Balboa has
a decision to make here, Jim.

He knows better than anyone

how this same story played out
three decades ago.

(PAINED GRUNTING)
ROCKY: Donnie, Donnie, talk to me.

Donnie.

Your ribs?

You think it's broke?
(GROANING)


(IN RUSSIAN)

ROCKY: What do you wanna do,
Donnie?


You wanna call it?


I didn't think so.

(IN RUSSIAN)

ROCKY: Now he's gonna
come after you,

and he's gonna try to break
on that rib some more.

But that's okay.

'Cause you like the pain.
You can take it.

You know why?
Because you're dangerous.

I'm dangerous.
ROCKY: That's right.

REFEREE: Ten seconds out.



JIM: Now here we go
with round ten

of what has become a war of attrition.
(BELL DINGS)

Drago seemingly ahead on the scorecards,
but Creed refusing to back down.

That's it, Donnie. Good.

MAX: Creed using whatever
he has left in the tank.

JIM: Drago working the body.

Tie him up!

JIM: And down goes
Creed again.

And this could be the end of the fight.
(PAINED GRUNTING)



(MUFFLED CHEERING)

Get up, D.



MAX: No man should be able to
fight through that beating,

but Adonis Creed
wills himself off the canvas.

REFEREE: What's your name?
Creed.

What's your name?

Creed!

Box!

MAX: Adonis Creed knows there
is no way around Viktor Drago.

He has to go through him.

Dig!

Dig! Dig!

JIM: Creed suddenly finding
another gear!

Come on!

JIM: Drago's on his heels.

(CROWD EXCLAIMS)


And down goes Drago!


That's it! That's right!

MAX: What a wild turn
of events.

(IN RUSSIAN)

REFEREE: Two.

Donnie, he gets up,
you go after him.

REFEREE: Three.

Four.

Five.

Six.
JIM: Drago beats the count.

MAX: I can't believe either of
these guys are still on their feet.

REFEREE: Box.

JIM: Drago seemingly so far ahead on
points, he just needs to stay upright

and make it to the end.

Here comes Creed again, driving
Drago back into the ropes.

Dig! Dig! Dig!
Yeah!

Come on, take him down!

Come on, baby.

MAX: And Viktor Drago is down!

Again!

What a turn this fight has taken.
(INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION)

(PANTING HEAVILY)

JIM: Creed doubled over
in pain

as Drago tries to
pick himself up off the floor.

(COUNTING DOWN IN RUSSIAN)

(PANTING WEAKLY)

(IN RUSSIAN)

(REFEREE CONTINUES
COUNTING DOWN)

MAX: Drago summons the strength,
manages to make the count.


(CROWD CHEERING)

JIM: They're still
swinging, Max.

MAX: Creed continuing
to connect.

And this is becoming
hard to watch, Jim.

I don't think Drago
has anything left,

but he refuses to give up.

And that's it! It's over!

(BELL DINGS)

JIM: Drago's corner
throws in the towel.

MAX: And Adonis Creed
defends his title.

Defends his name.

Creates his own legacy.

He is still the heavyweight
champion of the world.

JIM: And the Russian crowd is standing
and cheering for the American fighter.

(CROWD APPLAUDS)

(SPEAKS RUSSIAN)

Where's B at? Where's B?

(GRUNTS IN PAIN)
Easy, easy, easy.

Hey, back up. Everybody back up.
We need air.


ADONIS: We did it.
BIANCA: We did it.



(IN RUSSIAN)

(VIKTOR CRYING)

Let's go home.
Let's go, D.

I'm good.


I did it. I did it.
LITTLE DUKE: You did it.

Hey, Unc.


It's your time.

Hey, okay, back up.

(CROWD CHEERING
AND APPLAUDING)

What's up, Pops?


I'm sorry it took me so long
to come see you.


I'm not sure how
this is supposed to go. Um...

I guess I should tell you that
Mom's doing pretty good.

You know, she's holding up.

So is Rocky.

ROCKY: Thanks a lot.
DRIVER: Thank you.

ADONIS: <i>He's a tough dude.</i>

<i>I can see why you liked him.</i>

I also see why
you wanted to fight him, too.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Look, um,

I just came here
to tell you that...

That I did it.

But I didn't do it for you.

<i>Or because of them.</i>

<i>I did it because
it was my fight.</i>

<i>And when I stepped
into that ring,</i>

it wasn't just about me.

Hello.

You must be Logan.

Yes. Who are you?

ROBERT: Lo, who is it?

ADONIS: <i>Sometimes we think we
have to do it all on our own.</i>

Hey, Robert.

ADONIS: <i>But we don't.</i>

I was just around
in the neighborhood, so...

This is your grandfather.


You look just like his mother.

(ROBERT CHUCKLES)

Yeah, I know.

I wanna introduce you
to somebody.

Do you wanna come inside?

Yeah.

ROBERT: Give me that.

(ROCKY SNIFFS)

Is that a ball?
ROCKY: Yeah.

Wanna play catch?
LOGAN: Yes.

There you go.

This

is your granddaughter. Amara.

Say what's up to Pop-Pop.
