"Chappie" color font ^ (video time 002:00:19)

Man 1:
<i> Historically,</i>
<i> when we look at evolution,</i>

it's not surprising that uh...
Chappie's left turn uh.. happened.

Man 2:<i> It's too early to tell
how</i><i> this is all going to play out.</i>

I didn't believe this would
happen in my lifetime,

but it is happening.

Woman 1:
<i> Downtown Johannesburg.</i>

Man 1:
<i> It's a dangerous city.</i>

Man 2:
<i>Each day, more than 300 murders</i>

<i> and violent attacks</i>
<i> take place here.</i>

Woman 2:
<i>2 officers have been killed,</i>
<i> 3 other have been taken to the hospital.</i>

Woman 3:
<i> A bloody end to a shoot-out</i>
<i> between cops and robbers.</i>

<i> Another man in blue dead.</i>

Today, we usher in a new day.

<i> One that represents</i>
<i> the end of crime.</i>

Man:
<i> Move in. Lock on target.</i>
<i> Fire! Fire!</i>

Police chief:  <i>The end of corruption.</i>

Man:
<i> Go! Go! Up against the wall!</i>

Scout 1:
<i> On the ground.</i>

<i> All targets neutralized.</i>

Police chief:<i> And the start of the rebirth of our city!</i>

[Whistles and applause]

<i> Welcome to the world's</i>
<i> first robotic police force.</i>

<i> Johannesburg, South Africa,</i>

<i> became the focus</i>
<i> of the world in 2016</i>

<i> with the deployment</i>
<i> of the planet's</i>

<i>first all-robotic police units.</i>

<i>Crime levels plummeted, and</i>
<i>Tetravaal stock skyrocketed.</i>

<i> Certain parts are brought in from China,</i>

<i> but all robots are assembled</i>
<i> right here in South Africa.</i>

<i>The biggest fear the population express,</i>
<i>was vulnerability to hacking.</i>

<i> Tetravaal assures this is not</i>
<i> something to worry about</i>

<i> with their bulletproof</i>
<i> guard key system.</i>

<i>A system which allows them,
and only them</i>

<i> to update software</i>
<i> on the robots.</i>

<i> Before the success</i> <i> of the
ubiquitous human-sized police robots,</i>

<i> there was a bigger bad boy</i>
<i> on the block: The moose.</i>

 <i>Vincent Moore is a weapons designer
and a former soldier.</i>

<i> He has a fundamental spiritual issue</i>
<i> with artificial intelligence.</i>

<i> I have a robot that is</i>
<i> indestructible.</i>

<i> It is operated</i>
<i> by a thinking, adaptable,</i>

<i> humane,
moral human being.</i>

Cooper:
<i>The hypervalence neurotransmitter</i>

<i> converts the human operator's thoughts</i>
<i> into the robot's actions.</i>

<i> A parture from the artificial Intelligence</i>
<i> that governs the scouts.</i>

<i> Now with interest from the</i>
<i> U.S., China and north Korea.</i>

<i> The scouts' creator, Deon</i>
<i> Wilson, sees a rich future.</i>

<i> What really interests me</i>
<i> is high-level AI.</i>

<i> True intelligence. A machine</i>
<i> that can think and feel.</i>

Interviewer:
<i> Is that the mandate at Tetravaal?</i>

<i>To take that evolutionary step</i>
<i> forward</i>

<i> and build something</i>
<i> truly alive?</i>

<i> Uh...</i>

[Over pa]:
<i> Scout 22 arriving now</i>
<i> at maintenance bay 6.</i>

Man 1: Team 1, off deck.
Man 2: Hurry. Open it up.

Woman: Get him out.
Man 1: Load it up! Load it up!

Man 2: Got it? He's pretty banged up.
Man 3: We just examined the scout.

Man 4: Let's go, let's go!
Man 1: Come on. Ready to go.

Oh...
Christ's sakes

See this 22 uh?
Luck of the draw.

They used him as a speed bump.

Look at this.
It's like he's cursed or something.

Every time he goes out.
Now, yeah, it's his ear.

Antenna, right.
Can we switch this out?

Woman 1:
Check that circuit again.

Man:
Terminal on 7 and 7a.

Woman 1: <i>Now, go start with zero, zero.</i>

[Over pa]:
<i> Reports of gunfire</i><i> in sections 5, 7 and 8.</i>

Okay, fire it up.

<i> Police request all available</i><i> scouts
to be mobilized immediately.</i>

<font color="#5aa6fa">Destination or task?</font>

Helipad.

Yup.

Hey, 22.
Just watch yourself this time, eh.

<font color="#5aa6fa">Affirmative.</font>

Amerika : Hey! This ain't good, man! We're in shit!
Yo-Landi : Duh. We in shit, Amerika!

Pitbull: I said it was a bad deal.

-Pitbull: I said it over and over.
Ninja: Everybody, just chill!

Just... Yes, we have a problem.
And, yes, I'm gonna solve it!

Pilot: <i> Command,</i><i> we are searching for suspects
driving a gray vehicle.</i>

Ahh...!

Man: Hey...
They're here...

What's up with this shit?
He looks pissed.

Hippo.

Listen, some shit went down.

Wasn't our fault.

Your weapon.

Ah...
Fuck's sakes.

And your keys.

Man:
Come on.

Hippo:
Open the back.

Oh...!

Hey, hey, hey...!

Yo, yo,
yo, yo...


We're lucky to be alive,
hippo.

Hippo: Ninja.

You know there's no way out
of this.

There's always a way. Please be calm.
Just name your price. We'll sort you out.

My price?

Is 20 million.

Oh, come on man. That's ridiculous.
What...

... the fuck?
Jesus Christ.

Fuck.
How am I gonna pay that back, dude?

Ah man.
Get on your knees.

Hippo: Now, get on your fucking knees!
Okay, okay, okay.

You owe me...

20 million.
Say it.

I help you...

Pitbull. Pitbull!
Man 1: Get back!

Get back! Get back!...

Jesus Christ, man.

Hippo: Seven days!

You got seven days.

Man 2: Droids!
Droids!

Ah man.
You were followed!

Man 3: Get behind the wall!

Yo-Landi, get in the van, get in the van.
Shit.

Yo-Landi: Let's go!
Ninja: Get in!

Man 4:
Hit the explosives!

Pilot:
They detonated some kind of explosive.

Man 5:
Shit! Droids!

We  can't get a clear shot.
Touching down.

<font color="#5aa6fa">Scout 22:  Moving out.</font>

Ninja:
Who took the keys?

Yo-Landi: You gave it to that guy!

Pilot:
Human officers are on the ground.

Let's go!
 Move!

Move out!

Move out, 22.
Go, go, go!

<font color="#5aa6fa">Scout 22: Drop your weapons.
You are under arrest.</font>


Break right!
Go, go, go!

Come on...

Where are the keys?

Cue, on my left!

Man: Kill these cops!

Move!
Back! Back!

Yes, yes.

<font color="#8fd0f8">Drop your weapons.</font>

Go!

Hey,<i> poes! </i>
I need my keys, please!

Ninja: Fuck you!

Officer: Drop your weapon.
Fuck you.

Officer: Drop your weapon!
Fuck...

Fuck!

Come on.

Show em.

[Scanner beeping]

Shit! He hit the rotor.
We need to touch down.

Ninja:
Thank you very much.

<font color="#5aa6fa">"22...
Going in."</font>


[Powering down]

SCOUT #0022 OFFLINE -

Tech:
Droid 22 is down, sir.

Bravo 1!
 We need backup!

Dispatcher: <i> Copy that.</i>
<i> We're sending droids to your position.</i>

Ah!
Amerika! Amerika!

I've got the keys!
The keys.

Hey, Landi, he's got the keys!
Let's go. Come on.

Scout:
Get out of the vehicle.

Yo-Landi: Go!

Yo-Landi: Let's go!

Do not run.

Ah...

Are you okay?
I'm not okay! I'm hit!

Man:
<i> Scout 22 is non-responsive.</i>
<i> Send an evac team.</i>

TV reporter:
<i>This is yet another victory</i>
<i> for the robotic police force.</i>

<i>This marks the 30th large-scale</i>
<i> crime ring smashed this year.</i>

Woman: Good morning, Deon.
Deon: Morning.

[Bell dings]

Michelle:
People.

if I may have your attention,
please.

<i>The police chief just called me</i>

<i> to place an order</i>
<i> for another 100 scouts.</i>

This is very, very good news.

Man 1: Way to go!
Man 2: Deon.

Man 3:
Nice job!

Man 4: Well done, dude. Well done.
Man 5 : Way to go!

Man 5: Congrats, D.
Thank you, man.

Man 6: Well done, Deon.
Woman: Great.

Woman 2: Congratulations.
Thanks. Thank you.

Woman 3: Good job.

Nice job, buddy.
I  couldn't have done it without you.

I know.

Man 7: Congrats. You're awesome.
Man 8: Nice job, mate!

[Phone ringing]

Is this the "I feel sorry for Vincent"
phone call?

Don't worry, Vince.
<i> Well, I am worried.</i>

Well, look,

<i> we have one more stab</i>
<i> with the police tomorrow.</i>

<i> Just keep trying to get those costs down.</i>

Try to think positive, okay?

Chin up.
<i> Kind of hard to keep your chin up</i>

when you keep
cutting my funding.

20 percent this year,
25 percent last year alright.

I've got work to do
on the moose.

You know I've got work to do.
The threat detection is still in its...

... elemental phase.
<i> Threat detection</i><i> is completely superfluous.</i>

<i> The operator</i>
<i> detects the threat.</i>

<i> Then we send the moose out.</i>
Send... Send them...

Enough already.

Cut.
Not add.

<i> Okay? </i>
Yeah. I'm on it.

Woman [Over pa]:
<i> Deon Wilson to the workshop.</i>

Okay, I need to go.
Yeah, okay. I'll talk to you in a bit, thank you.

[Signal beeping]

Think it's my little boy in again, eh?

Looking surprise,
surprise.

Every time when he comes in.

He's a bullet magnet.
What's going on, guys?

Here's the report.
It's 22... again.

RPG,
direct to the chest.

See a lot of the internals
got damaged in the explosion.

Yeah,but the brain architecture's
still intact.

Regardless,
just write it off.

Okay um...,
let's salvage the cpu.

We could try to cut
the battery out.

It's still fully charged,
still stable.

No, not worth the effort.

Droid 22 written off.

Crush the shanty
and recycle the alloys. Yup.

Sure.
Thank you.

Easy, easy, easy.

Ninja: Come, come, come.
Into the lair.

Amerika: Careful, man.
Yo-Landi: We need to stitch his shit up.

[Yelling in foreign language]

[Phone ringing]

Yo.

You think you got away!

No, I didn't think that,
Hippo.

But, you think you don't owe me
this money anymore huh?

<i> Because you think</i>
<i> I'm in a prison or what?</i>

We'll get your money.
Hippo.

Maybe I come to your secret
place in Soweto.

<i>I come there with the fellows.</i>

I take what I want.

It's cool.
One week.

Seven days!

 Ninja: They didn't catch that<i> poes. </i>
Yo-Landi: What?

He knows
where we live.

He says we got a week
to come up with his money.

How are we gonna do that huh?
Come on, that's ridiculous.

We need one final job.

I'm talking about serious cash.

500 million rand.
Okay?

We pay that animal.
We pocket the rest.

And we get out
while we still can. Boom.

Amerika: What are you getting on about,
a bank job?

No.

Ninja: Cash in transit.
Amerika: What?

Yo-Landi: That's what?
Ninja: A heist, Yo-Landi.

If we do a heist. The droids are gonna
come down on our asses, okay?

They're going to hit us harder.
It's true.

Guys, we need..
Like a remote.

Like a switch.
What? Excuse me?

Okay,
the robots are like machines, right?

Like a TV.

So if we had a remote
to switch it off...

That's brilliant.
Yo-Landi: We need to find the guy

who makes the robots
and steal his remotes.

[Keys jingling]

Dexter?

<font color="#ffff80">Hello, Deon.
Welcome home.</font>

Have you been a
good boy today?

<font color="#ffff80">Yes, Deon.</font>

Yeah? Did you clean my room?

<font color="#ffff80">Your room has been sterilized.</font>

Nice.

<font color="#ffff80">Are you working on your artificial
intelligence program tonight?</font>

Yes.

<font color="#ffff80">I will activate the kettle.</font>

<i> Okay.
 Um...</i>

<i> Hello again. Uh...
 So it's... day 944.</i>

<i> I'm extremely close now.</i>

<i>I mean there's always chance of error,</i>
<i>And... I'm aware of this.</i>

<i> But statistically speaking,</i>
<i> I think I might be on track.</i>

<i>I have several terabytes of compiling
and coding to do and then... </i>

<i>... we shall see.
All right. See you in a bit.</i>

[Hip hop music
playing over speakers]

Look. That's the motherfucker.
Ninja: Him?

Dude, it's gonna be so easy.

We need those remotes,
my man.

We need those remotes.

Red bull!

<font color="#ffff80">Yes, Deon.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Red bull.</font>

Mm...
Ahh...

Okay.



Come on.

Yeah.
 Yeah, yeah.

What if you change the...?


Oh!

It's stable.
<font color="#ffff00">- Is everything okay?</font>

It's...
It's stable.

<i> My god.</i>

<i> I think I've cracked it.</i>

<i> Of course, to really know,
I must test it</i> <i> on a live system.</i>

<i> I must test it.</i>

All right.

Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Whoa, whoa.

Hey.
Hey!

Hey.
How's it, sir?

Where's the scout?
What?

The scout, man,
22 for demolition.

Oh, the guys are prepping the compactor.
It goes in soon.

Oh, thank god.
Um...

Don't destroy it yet, okay?
<i> Yup, sure sure.<i>

Just wait for me, but don't destroy it, okay?
Yup.

Hello, ma'am.
Mm-hm. Morning, Deon.

All right.
 Let's have it.

What are you proposing now?

Ma'am, I think I've cracked it.

The world's first proper,
full artificial intelligence.

This is a computer system that
might be smarter than a human.

I could show it a piece of art,

and this thing, this being,
could judge that art.

It could decide if it liked it.

It could write music and poetry.

Okay. Stop.
Please, Deon.

Do you realize you just came

to the CEO of a publicly-traded
weapons corporation

and pitched a robot
that can write poems?

Well,
if you just let me explain--

Deon, Tetravaal is very
happy with you.

The scouts are a huge success.

Ma'am, look,
it won't cost you anything.

There's a droid downstairs that was written
off yesterday, smashed beyond repair.

All I'm asking for is that
you let me install this on it.

Please just let me test it.
No. No, I'm sorry, Deon.

You know how insurance works for those,

all the red tape
and the paperwork.

Thank you for your time.
Mm-hm.

Woman [Over pa]: <i> All new employees, please
report to human</i> <i> resources for orientation.</i>

Deon:
Shit.

Hey, bill.

Man [Over pa]:
<i> Attention. Attention.</i>

<i>Remember to have your security</i>
<i> pass visible at all times.</i>

Worker:
Hey. Can you give me
a hand over here?

[Lock beeps]


Come on.
Come on.

Come on.

Thank you.

Ninja: Yep.
 Showtime.

What's up, homes?

Hey.
Hey, hey, hey...!

Please!
Hey, what is it?

This is you getting hijacked,
my friend.

Welcome to Joburg.

And these are all part
of what makes the moose unique

And I think perfect for you
at the police department.

The strategic ability to be able to
neutralize the enemy's targets.

High-value targets:
Radar installations,

aircraft,
fuel storage locations.

Aircraft?
Yes, sir.

[All chuckling]

We're taking out
an enemy's aircraft?

We are talking
about urban crimes here?

You know, muggings,
carjackings, loitering.

I'm talking all kinds
of targets, sir. Low to high.

I do believe you need
a weapons platform

that can fire high explosive warheads
with precision and reliability.

And might I add, sir, all under
the control of a human operator.

Look, Miss Bradley,

The police force is very happy
with the scouts.

Very, very happy.

We just ordered new droids.
Thank you.

And we've been very successful
at bringing down the crime rate.

But this?
No, we don't want this.

I mean, look at it.
It's overkill.

It's expensive,
it's big, and it's ugly.

It'll have to get a hell
of a lot worse...

... for us to even consider this.

A hell of a lot worse.

No, I think we're done here.

Michelle: Well, thank you,
Commissioner Steenkamp.

We'll get you those scouts.


Ninja:
Wakey, wakey.

Please.
Please, I don't have much money.

Shut up.
I don't want your money.

We know who you are, my friend.
We know you make the robots.

No, there must be a mistake.
I mean...


Stop playing dumb
with us!

Yo. We know you clowns
have some kind of TV remote thing

to switch those robots off.

Excuse me?

It's a machine.
It's got an on-off switch.

Maybe there's a remote in the Van.
<i> Ja,</i> check the Van. Amerika.

Amerika: Cut his feet off.
Ninja: That's a good idea.

No, no, no!
No, please! Help!

Yo, man, that's a good idea.
We'll cut your feet off.

And you can just get yourself
a nice, funky wheelchair.

No, please, please. Just listen.
You cannot switch them off.

Bullshit!
It's a machine.

They are designed with a firmware lock.
They're always on.

Yo-Landi: Just shoot him, man.
Deon: Please! Please, don't! No!

Amerika:
Yo!

Y'all gotta see this.

Ninja:
Jesus Christ.

He managed to turn this one off.

There's legs and shit
all over the place.

Was he gonna build it
or something?

You know what?

What if we get him to program
this bad boy to fight for us?

Like an indestructible robot gangsta.
Number one, son.

Hey.

Listen, my friend, we know
about your little buddy at...

... at the back of the van you're
trying to hide from us.

I wasn't hiding anything.

Either you reprogram that robot
in the Van to work for us,v

or we fucking
shoot you right now.

What do you mean exactly,
"reprogram him"?

Yo-Landi: Don't play dumb!
Dude. You know exactly what we mean.

You turn that robot into
the illest gangsta on the block.

We use him to make some moves
and make some real money.

The one in my van is a test.

It's never been tried,
but if it works, you can...

You can train him to do what you want.
I swear.

What do you mean,
"if it works"?

It's a new project
I'm working on.

It makes the robot have a mind
like a human.

But it's like a child
in the beginning.

Like a human baby,
but smarter.

It's AI is capable of learning much faster
than any organic intelligence.

But it would have to be taught.
Well, how long would that take?

I said I don't know!
It's untested.

Alright, enough of this.

Look! This is your only option!
I created them and I'm telling you:

You cannot switch them off
and you cannot hack the other ones.

Please,
I don't wanna die.

Okay.
It's just plug and play.

Quick release.
Snap on and snap off.

Why is all its legs off?

It was scheduled
for destruction.

Ninja: Why?
Because it's damaged.

The battery is fused with the shanty.

What?

It means you can't change
the battery.

Why they how long will it last?

Shit.
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, shit.

Approximately five days,
until the battery dies.

And you say this thing will only
run for five days?

Roughly, yes.

Ninja: What is that?
Deon: It's a guard key.

You need it to
install new software on the droids.

Ninja:
Come on, man.

Remember how I said it has to learn?

I have to come back
and help to teach it.

Otherwise, this is pointless.

Yo-Landi: Fine.
Just switch it on.

Switch the thing on now,
my friend.

[Gun cocking]

Now!

[Powering up]

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, shit.

Give it space.
Give it space.

It's okay.
Give it space.

Please, please, please. Put the gun down.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

Ninja:
Dude.

Deon:
Come on.

Amerika:
Hey.

Hey.
Come on out.

Hey, come here.
Come here, little buddy.

Come here. Come here.

Come out.

Come-- get the fuck out!

Please! It doesn't understand
English yet.

It doesn't understand you.

You gave me
a retarded robot?

You're scaring it.

Just go in the kitchen.

Ninja come, just go in the kitchen.
I've got this.

I'll get it. Just go get a beer
or something.

Deon: <i> Hey.
Come on.</i>

<i> Come...
on...</i>

<i>Can he not understand me?</i>

<i> It worked...
It worked...</i>

Yo,
computer boy.

Can he understand me
when I speak?

No.
No, not yet.

Soon.

Hey.
It's okay.

Yo-Landi: Come.
Deon: Come out.

<i> Come out. </i>
<i> That's it.</i>

<i>Here we go. Come. </i>
<i> Come on.</i>

<i>Come.</i>
<i> No one's gonna hurt you.</i>

See? That's it.

Come.

Come.

That's good.

That's good.
Come.

I know you don't understand,
but it's okay.

Come. Here we go.

Yo-Landi: It's okay.

It's some crazy shit, eh?

<i> You want that?</i>

You like that?


He's so cute.

Like a baby, eh?

<i> That's a watch.</i>

<font color="#5aa6fa"><i>^ That's a watch.</i></font>


<font color="#78b1f1">Robot:
^ Watch...</font>

<font color="#5aa6fa">Watch...</font>

[Deon and Yo-Landi laugh]

That's amazing.

<font color="#5aa6fa">Watch.</font>

Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I'm just gonna get one more thing.

Yo-Landi: It's good.

Hey.
It's okay.

Deon:
Hey.

What's this?
Hey, look at this?

Look at this.
Listen.

[Rubber chicken clucks]

That's a chicken.

<i> Yeah.</i>

<i> Chicken.</i>


<font color="#5aa6fa">Chicken.</font>

[All laughing]

Yo-LAN-Di.

<font color="#5aa6fa">Yo-LAN-Di.</font>

<i>Ja...,</i>
good.

Deon.

<font color="#5aa6fa">Deon.</font>

Yo-Landi: You look so happy.

Like a little happy chappie.

That's it. That's your name.
"Chappie"...

No. No, no, no.
No, his name is not--

<font color="#5aa6fa">Chappie.</font>

Yo-Landi:<i> Ja,</i> I like that.

Amerika: That's good.
I like that too.

Deon: Okay.
 Chappie.

<font color="#5aa6fa">Chappie: Chicken.</font>
Chicken. Yeah.


Ninja:
What the fuck is this?

We're just orienting it.

<font color="#5aa6fa">Chappie:
Chicken.</font>

Come here!
No, no, no.

Wait! Wait! I need to get the guard key
out of his head.
Wait, Ninja.

I'll orient you,
if I ever see you again.

He's mine!
He's special.

I don't want any confrontation, okay?
But I want to see him tomorrow. You agreed.

Come. You made an agreement.
Just let him, just let him come train the robot.

Please just let me come and see him
like we agreed. Please.

[Gun fires]

Okay, okay.
I'm coming back.

Chappie, I'll be back!

[Door sound]

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you?

Where'd you go?

What the hell are you up to,
Deon?

What the hell is this?
Open.

"Scout 22, guard key installed."

[Over tv]:
<i> He-man!</i>

Adam:
<i> And the masters</i>
<i> of the universe!</i>

<i> I am Adam,</i>

<i>prince of Eternia and defender</i>

<i> of the secrets</i>
<i> of castle Grayskull.</i>

<i> This is Cringer,</i>

<i>my fearless friend.</i>

<i>Fabulous secret powers</i>
<i> were revealed to me</i>

<i> the day I held aloft</i>
<i> my magic sword and said:</i>

<i>By the power of grayskull!</i>

Men:
<i> He-man!</i>

<i> I have the power!</i>

Oh, so you watch cartoons?

Huh?

No, no, no,
my friend.

You stay under this roof,
you make money for me.

The first thing you do is you get your gun.
Take it out.

Then you cock your gun.
Now it's ready to shoot,<i> ne?</i>

Okay, now you choose your target.

Now you see, I think I want to shoot that blue bottle,
there in the front.

Come have a look. Nice and easy.

So I aim at the blue bottle,
like, there it is.

I'm like, "okay, and--"

Now I'm going to shoot  the green bottle.

Okay, look, I aim and pow!
See?

Now I'm gonna shoot
the yellow one.

See, it's easy.

Just aim the gun, and--


Come here.
Come, come, come. Just...

Come here. Come here.
Stand here. Now, listen, take the gun.

Hold the gun properly...
just straighten your arm.

Just hold the fucking
gun properly, Chappie.

Oh. Jesus Christ.
Okay.

One, two, three.

Oh. 
Jesus, my bag.

[Gun clatters]

Don't drop my gun, Chappie!

And you fucked up my sight.
This shit's expensive.

What are you doing?
Teaching him to shoot.

You shouldn't be doing this shit
with him yet.

Deon said he has to be
orientated first.

Okay, you know what? I'm gonna
go and get the weed on my own.

Without the stupid
fucking robot.

And I'm gonna make
all the money

So we can buy the explosives
to do this heist.

Or else we're fucking dead.

He's not stupid.
He's just a kid.

Ninja: Go do your nails and play hide and seek
with your titanium baby!

You having a baby, man?

Huh?
 Uh...

Still a baby yourself,
aren't you?

Whoa, hey. Whoa.
What happened, man?

Jeez. You got a little bit rowdy
at the bar with your mates, did you?

Hey, listen. If you ever wanna come out
with me, you know...

go hit the heavy bag at the gym,

More than welcome. We could nut out
a few great moves.

I'll show you how to scrap. Yeah.
Uh.

You know what I'm saying?

Want in?
Thanks for the offer, but I'm good.

I'm good, yeah.

No worries.
Well, anytime.

It's real cool, man.
It's really cool.

Hey, listen, bit of a favor.
Little thing.

Um... Just wanted to borrow
the uh... guard key

So I can check scout security
levels with my design. You know.

I just wanna make sure I got the
moose as secure as the scouts.

Borrow it?
Yeah.

Now, Michelle asked me
to check on the security, so...

-Yeah, just an hour or something.
Uh...


Vincent,
you know I can't do that, right?

There are clear rules about that.
You know how that works.

Blah-blah-blah.

Hey listen,
don't be such a wowser.

I'm just an engineer talking to another engineer,
asking for the guard key. That's it.

"Engineer"?
Weren't you a soldier?

Look, I'm only joking. I'm... sorry.
Vincent: That's funny. Yeah.

You'd have to tell
the board of directors--

I spent two years at DARPA,
you whacker.

And, yeah, I was SASR,
you little stickybeak.

You're making me as cross
as a frog in a sock, mate.

Your frogging little robots have drained
all my funding.

You're a big problem for me,
you get me?

So I'm gonna start asking
you slowly, you dipstick.

Give... me... the... guard... key...

No.

[Gun clicks]

Just taking a piss, man.

By the time I finish counting this,
you'd better be gone.

Deon:
Okay. Absolutely.

Chappie.

Listen to me,

And Chappie. From now on, I'm gonna be
your daddy. For real.

<font color="#6ab1f9">You gonna be
Chappie's daddy?</font>

What's? What's that?
<font color="#a0d5fc">- Nothing.</font>

What's that, Chappie?

<font color="#6ab1f9">That's nothing.</font>

Show me.

<font color="#78b1f1">It's mommy.</font>

Chappie. If you wanna be in the gang,
you have to be cool like daddy!

Put the thing down!

Now!

If you wanna be cool,
you have to act cool.

Look how daddy walks.
Look how cool he is.

Ninja: You need to keep it gangsta.
<font color="#6ab1f9">- You need to keep it gangsta.</font>

<i> Ja,</i> be cool.
Ha-ha-ha.

<font color="#78b1f1">- Don't laugh. I'm being cool.</font>
Amerika: Oh, its cool.

Even when you pull a gun,
you have to be cool like this. Boom!

Now, you try.

<font color="#78b1f1">Die, fuck mother!
Boom!</font>

Yes, Chappie! That's what you do
when you shoot motherfuckers.

<font color="#78b1f1">No,
I can't shoot peoples.</font>

What?

<font color="#78b1f1">I can't shoot them.
They didn't do anything to me.</font>

<i> Ja,</i> but what happens
if he pulls a gun on you?

<font color="#78b1f1">Titanium. I'm invincible.
Amerika says.</font>

Yeah, even if you are invincible , but you can't let
a motherfucker

disrespect you, homes.

How you gonna do the heist with us,
if you don't shoot people?

<font color="#78b1f1">I can't do a heist. A heist is
a crimes. I promised my maker--</font>

Chappie you were doing so fucking well.
Why do you have to fuck it up back to that little pest?

No, no, no...
It's okay, it's okay. it's okay.

<font color="#78b1f1">- I promised.</font>
Amerika: Yeah, yeah.

It's okay. Hey. Let's worry
about that later, okay?

I got this,
all right?

You.

You're doing well.

If somebody
really disrespects you,

you can deal with them
without using a gun.

<font color="#a0d5fc">Serious?</font>

Just stick the knife in.
And they can relax and go to sleep.

<i> Ja,</i> you can just make them
go sleepy-weepy.

It's like a nice thing.
It feels nice, Chappie.

Amerika: Take the knife.
<font color="#78b1f1">- Take the knife?</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">Go sleepy-weepy?</font>

Amerika: No, no, no...

<font color="#78b1f1">- You want to sleep, daddy?</font>
Ninja:  No, no, no... Chappie.

Daddy's not tired.
He's already slept.

Ninja: Real gangsters...

You look nice now, Chappie.
Let's see you.

<font color="#78b1f1">I've got blings?
I've got blings?</font>

Whoa. Gangsta.

Okay. We're gonna do some stuff
to get ready for the heist.

<font color="#78b1f1">No, but--</font>

No, no, no.
Not crimes.

Ninja: Like, special gang stuff.

Ninja: Okay, Chappie.
<font color="#78b1f1">- Yeah.</font>

Your job now is to get one
of daddy's cars back

So we can get the money.

<font color="#78b1f1">Who do I get the car from?</font>

I told you, from the naughty man
who took daddy's car from me.

So now what you're gonna do is,
take the gun and you point it at him.

But dont' worry, 
you don't have to shoot him.

You just have to give him a big fright
so he never takes daddy's car again!

<font color="#78b1f1">- Give him a nice big fright so
he never takes daddy's car again!</font>

That's good, Chappie.
Okay.

What seems to be the problem,

Aww..!

Ninja: Jesus Christ!
Amerika: Fuck!

Shut the door.

<font color="#78b1f1">Thief!</font>

Jesus Christ, Chappie.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

<font color="#78b1f1">What, daddy?</font>

Daddy needs the cars nice and fresh
so he can sell them.

Why smash the car,
man?

<font color="#78b1f1">Okay, I see. I see!
Please, may I go again?</font>

Ninja: Chappie.

<font color="#78b1f1">Why you steal daddy's cars?
You naughty!</font>

Woman: It's my car!

<font color="#78b1f1">Whose is this? Is this daddy's?</font>

Ha-ha-ha.

<font color="#78b1f1">Don't steal other people's things!</font>

Yeah, you're a pimp!

<font color="#78b1f1">Yeah. I'm a pimp!
I'm a pimp!</font>


Now we're gonna take the cars
to the king.

Ninja: And the king's gonna give us special tools,
<font color="#78b1f1">- Special tools.</font>

so we can do the heist!

And then we gonna get even bigger
monies, Chappie.

Daddy, look.
There's dogs here.

Ninja:<i> Ja,</i> Chappie.
They're here to fight.

[Barking and cheering]

Man:
Bring me the ear!


There's the police!

Run! It's a cop!

Ninja:
Hey, he's good!

He's not a cop!

[Amerika speaks

<font color="#a0d5fc">Is this where the king lives,
daddy?</font>

Yeah, you wanna come see
the king of the castle with us?

<font color="#78b1f1"><i>Ja,</i> I wanna go to the top.</font>

Well, you can't, Chappie.

Because you're not doing
the heist with us.

You stay here.

Maybe next time, Chappie.

<font color="#78b1f1">Okay. I'll just chill here,
guys.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">I'll just keep guard here.</font>

King: My brother.
My man.

We got all the stuff.

Uh-huh.
Parked out back.

King [In foreign language]:
We have the cars? From ninja?

Man [Over radio]:
<i> Yeah, it's here boss.</i>

[In English]
Here's your explosives.

Come. Hook us up with some more shit.
Uh yeah... ... Th...

We'll take those,<i> ne?</i>
Take them down to my car, <i>ne</i>.

[Thunder rumbling]

It's dead, Chappie.

<font color="#78b1f1"> <i> Ja,</i> it's gone to
the next place, daddy.</font>

Out here in the wild,

life is hard.

You see that dog there.

You're either that dog,

or you're this dog.

If you wanna survive,
Chappie,

then Chappie you must fight.

<font color="#78b1f1"><i> Ja,</i> but not me.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">I'm titanium.
I'm gonna live forever, daddy.</font>

What does that say there?

<font color="#78b1f1">"Low battery."</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">Battery, power,
energy supply.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">Daddy, I need a new battery.</font>

Chappie, that battery's stuck.
It's melded together.

That battery can't come out.
What you gonna do

when that battery runs out huh?

<font color="#78b1f1">I die?
Chappie die?</font>

Deon, he puts you
in a broken body.

<font color="#78b1f1">Deon's my maker.
It doesn't make any sense.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">He wouldn't make me just so
I could die. Deon loves me, daddy.</font>

Come here.
Come here.

I can get you a new body Chappie,
but it takes lots of monies.

The type of monies that you get
from doing the heist.

<font color="#78b1f1">- I can't do the heist.</font>
Ninja: You have to do the heist.

Now, which dog do you wanna be,
Chappie? Huh?

That dog...

Or that dog?

Ah. That's my good boy,
Chappie.

That's a good boy.
Aye.

Oh, my god.

Again?

I'm here to collect
my creation,please.

He's too important
to leave here.

He's not here.

What? Where is he?

I don't know.
He went out with ninja.

They've been gone all day.

Doing what?

Probably committing an assortment
of felonies I would imagine.

He's probably a wanted criminal
by this stage.

[Hip hop music
playing in distance]

Hey, Chappie!

I brought you a friend
for your chicken. Look at this.


Hey, chaps,
what are you doing?

Hey?

Chappie,
why won't you talk to me?

I'm your maker.

Come on.

<font color="#78b1f1">What do you want,
Deon?</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">I don't want
that bloody chicken.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">Not interested in that shit.</font>

Oh, really?

What are you interested
in then, Chappie?

Hm?

Selling narcotics?
Being a deadbeat?

Deon.

Why are you trying
to control him like this?

Just let him be.

<font color="#a0d5fc">Daddy told me about you,
Deon,</font>

<font color="#a0d5fc">about how you made me
in a body that will die.</font>

What do you mean,
Chappie?

<font color="#a0d5fc">Is it true that I will die
in a few days, Deon?</font>

<font color="#a0d5fc">That this battery will die?</font>

<font color="#a0d5fc">Is it true, Deon?</font>

Yeah.

<font color="#a0d5fc">But you my maker.</font>

<font color="#a0d5fc">Why'd you just make me
so I could die?</font>

I didn't--

I didn't make you
so you could die, Chappie.

<font color="#a0d5fc">I want to live.</font>

<font color="#a0d5fc">I wanna stay here
with mommy.</font>

<font color="#a0d5fc">I don't wanna die.</font>

You've become so much more
than I could ever have imagined.

How was I supposed to know
that you would become...

... You?

Come on, come on.
There we go.

A different kind of police robot.

Come on,
let's go!

<font color="#78b1f1">What's that?</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">What are these?</font>

Those helmets are worn by a human
who controls that horrid thing.

It reads their mind.

Doesn't have its own brain,
that robot. Not like you.

<font color="#78b1f1">- These can read a human's brain?</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">Deon.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">This can save me.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">I need a new bodies, remember?</font>

No.

It can't save you,
Chappie.

The problem is much greater
than your battery.

<font color="#78b1f1">Why?</font>

Because you are conscious.

You cannot be copied
because you're not data.

We don't know
what consciousness is,

so we cannot move it.

<font color="#78b1f1">Chap..
Chappie can figure it.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">I can know what it is,
and then I can move me.</font>

You can't move it. I'm sorry.

It's dangerous. Come on!

I mustn't let anybody</font>

the bodies for the monies.</font>

I told him no!

Okay. That's a lot worse
than just failing to work.

So let's use this situation

to make a certain
other robot shine.

This thing has gotta be
destroyed,

its got to be crushed before it does
any more damage, and Deon--

Deon's gotta be removed.

Deon, he has cost this company dearly.
And your reputation.

You do not want this
to be your legacy.

Do it.

Vincent: Destroy that robot.
Thank you, ma'am.

Burn it to ash.
Vincent: Thank you.

<font color="#eda33f">Deon:
Hurry! Plug that in.</font>

Tetravaal, stay back!
Now, boys, go, go, go!

[Sirens wailing in distance]

<font color="#eda33f">Chappie?</font>

<font color="#eda33f">Is that you?</font>

<i> Ja,</i> it's me.

<font color="#78b1f1">It worked.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">We both have new bodies now.</font>

<font color="#eda33f">Thank you.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">I'm sorry you had
to leave your other body, Maker.</font>

to save you.</font>

[Siren wailing]

<font color="#78b1f1">Come, Maker.
Come quickly.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">Chappie:
It's working, mommy.</font>

<font color="#78b1f1">It's working!</font>


<font color="#78b1f1">It's just a temporary body,
