[Narrator] See the most
fantastic terror thrills

the screen has ever brought you.

(Women screaming)

(man screaming)

(woman screaming)

(man screaming)

Beware.

(Demon laughing maniacally)

(man laughing creepily)

The first Roman Grocer film I ever saw

was called Scream Queen Massacre,

the one where the bathing
beauty contestants

were stalked and killed by
the raving, psycho maniac.

I was 10 years old

and that was when I decided
to become a filmmaker

Slaughter Studios in its day was the best.

Roman Grocer had produced 122 films here,

and I have seen every single one of them.

[Man] But we were (mumbles)

Not cooked, you?


This was a lobster.

No, one lobster, a giant lobster.

Lemme talk to the boss.

[Steve] I don't know
how many you've seen,

but I have a few of my favorites.

Lumberjack, my dad took me.

After 10 minutes, he
wanted to leave the theater

but I talked him into staying.

Fungus, I loved the
tagline: It'll grow on you.

His first and only western, Tin Can Kelly.

Brilliant.

Hobbes, the only feminist

Cherry Hill High.

Loved Cherry Hill High, just because.

Of course, Rock n' Roll Diner,

which I first saw with my little brother.

This film made my brother piss his pants.

Too bad the Justin Kirkpatrick
thing had to happen.

Where the fuck are my actors?!

Hey, you don't have
to wait for me, Roman.

You don't have to wait
for me either, baby.

(Bell dinging)

Mr Kirkpatrick!

Mr Kirkpatrick!

Mr. Kirkpatrick, they need you on the set.

They're ready for you.

We're almost done, one minute.

That feel okay, Justin?

You know some of this
tape's pinchin' me, man.

It's fuckin' cold.

If you think it hurts now,
wait 'til we take it off.

(Scoffs) Jesus.

Where have you been?

Can you get on set, please?
Alright, alright.

I'm waitin' forever.

What the hell took you?

Come on!

Tryin' to make a movie here, will ya?

Put yourself where you're supposed to be.

Okay, is everybody set?

Is everybody in places?

Could we have some quiet?

Alright, roll sound!
Speed!

(Bell dinging)

Roll camera!

Mark it!

[Man] 78-1, mark.

Are we ready?

Action!

(Film whirring)

What're you whacked-out
horse bags doin' here?

How many times I gotta tell
you to stay away from my club?

(Chuckles) If it ain't Rock
Candy, all rag and sweet-like.

Ooh.

Oh yeah?

That's the way you want to play it, huh?

Huh?

Let's go, (mumbles).

You want a piece of me?

You're goin' down, bitch.

Down.
No way, Rock Candy.

(Rock Candy grunting)

Eat lead!

(Gun blasting)

Cut!

Cut, cut!

(Crowd cheering)

What the fuck was that?

Nobody dies like that
in a Roman Grocer film!

Nobody!

Ya understand, Justin?

Justin!

Justin!

(Soft somber music)

Justin?

[Man] He's not movin'.

(Muffled whispering)

Call an ambulance, Justin's been shot!

That was the last film ever
made at Slaughter Studios.

It's been rotting away for
more than 20 years now.

(Door creaking)

Some say this place is haunted

and the ghost of Justin Kirkpatrick

still roams these hallways
and empty sound stages

to this day looking to
finish his last film.

That's where we come in.

Steve, what have you got up your sleeve?

A secret plan, Madi.

He's right on time like clockwork.

What's so secret you can't
tell your own girlfriend?

You'll find out along with
the others. (Laughs maniacally)

Naughty Sex Kittens versus
the Giant Praying Mantis?

We're gonna make it
in the truest tradition

at Slaughter Studios.

No time, no money, it'll be great!

But we've got to hurry before
they demolish the place.

How many weeks?

Nine hours.

Nine hours?

That's right, tonight!

How are we possibly gonna do that?

Digital video.

Everyone's goin' digital these days.

Gary's got a camera, it'll work.

Tell 'em, Gary.

I've got a camera, it'll work.

Now what we do need is

four or five great-looking actresses

who can stay up all night
and do nudity for free.

I've got some girls in my class.

They'll totally do it.

Great!

Some of them are actually good.

It doesn't matter.

This script is bulletproof.

Bring as many as you
can; any actors as well.

(Silverware crashing)

Dammit!

I'm sorry.

Sorry.
Yeah.

[Woman] This is Kevin.

Hey.

Hi, hey.
Hey.

This is Steve, Madigan, Gary.

Hi, how are ya?
Nice to meet you, Kevin.

It's a pleasure.

Alright get a seat, Kev.

Kevin is classically trained.

He studied in London;
Shakespeare for four years.

He's great.
Is that so?

Thou art a fellow of good respect.

Thy life had some smatch of honor in it.

Take then my sword and turn away thy face

while I do run upon it.

Wilt thou, Strato?

Farewell, good Strato.

Caesar, now be still! (Breathes heavily)

That was amazing.
Thanks.

Can I be in it?

Sweetheart, I was hoping
you'd do makeup and wardrobe.

Oh.

Hello Sex Kittens, what is up?

I'm seeing party started without me.

Did I miss anything?

Well Ollie, only the greatest
opportunity of your life.

(Mumbles), count me inside.

Ready to do some acting?

You bet.

What's my role?

(Praying mantis growling)

Brilliant.

The movie is only as good
as the monster is bad.

That's pretty awful.

Did you remember to pack the blood?

A whole gallon.

Great!

Here they come. (Laughs)

Hello, hello!

How ya doin'?
Great!

Ready to meet your cast?
Absolutely.

Alright.

Here you go.

Rebecca, this is Steve.

(Van banging)

Hi, Sam.

What's your name again?

Steve.

Oh hi Steve, I'm Rebecca.

It's a pleasure.

Nice to meet you, Rebecca.

Nice to meet you too.
Lovely, very, very.

Hi there, Darlene Valentine.

Yes.
Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, Darlene.

I'm Steve.

Very beautiful.
Oh, hi.

Hello.
Hey, I'm Candyce.

I'm here to meet Justin.

Nice to meet you, Candyce.

Very, very nice.

Oh no, germs too rampant.

I'm allergic.

You are?

Portia, like the car only spelled

so you can understand how to pronounce it.

Portia, charming.

Listen, I've never done

one of these monster flicks before.

I don't wanna leave that
slimy stuff on my body

otherwise I'll walk.

Oh be a doll and carry
this for me, will ya?

She's just a little bitch.

Hey there, everybody.

I'm Chad Daniels.

Glad to be here.

Hello Chad, I'm Steve Sperg.

Nice to meet you.
Right, bro.

You're the man.

Yes, I suppose.
Right.

I'm ready for my up-close, Mr (mumbles).

Hello, Ollie.

Do your worst.

I gave him all the script I have.

I kinda noticed there
wasn't that many lines.

I only counted 8 1/2 lines for my part.

Yeah.
Yeah, what's up with that?

That's because this is
a conceptual horror story

about the obsessive love

between humans and overgrown nature.

We'll be improvising most
of the lines. (Laughs)

Right this way.

He must be a genius.

(Van door slamming)

[Ollie] I'd kill for
eight lines in a movie.

You counted them?

Gather 'round, gather 'round.

The only thing we must watch out for

is a security guard who makes his rounds

five minutes 'til every hour at which time

we must shut off all the
lights until he's finished.

(Energetic fanfare music)

Let's make history.

We're going in!

Gary, help me.

(Steve grunting)

The fuck's in here?

This thing is heavy.

(All screaming)
(startling music)

(mumbles) head back to the cage.

Get away, you (mumbles) mortal.

Sorry.

(Intriguing music)

What's the hold up?

Laughter Studios?

Ooh, did they make comedies here?

Yeah, sort of.

(Ominous music)

this way, everyone.

This way.

Ooh god.

Shit, this is (mumbles).

It's so creepy.

Come on, everyone.

I think it's right ahead.

(Eerie music)

Hey, can I get a flashlight?

(Muffled crosstalk)

Oh god, my (mumbles).

I can't breathe in this dust.

What's that smell?

[Ollie] I am getting heebie-jeebie.

Do we have craft services on this shoot?

You're gonna watch your step.

Shit (mumbles), your tail.
Oh I'm sorry, Gary.

What a dump.

I'm gonna see Justin.


I don't have any
flashlights or (mumbles).

Huh, who's that?

[Chad] I'm supposed to star in this

and I don't even have a flashlight.

Alright already, Chad.

Disgusting.

Come on princess, move along up there.

Slut.
Excuse me?

What'd you say to me?

Nothing.

Come back here and say that to my face.

Come on you guys, don't fight.

We're making a movie.

(Body thudding)

Oh jeez.

Chad, are you okay?

Yeah.

(Screams) Spider!
Shut up.

You don't understand.

I'm allergic to spiders.
You know what?

I'm allergic to you.

Come on, (mumbles).

Well if I could see, I
wouldn't be fallin' over stuff.

Just stick close to us, okay?

I don't have another flashlight.

Keep it moving.

Steve, do you know where we're going?

I think I see it.

I can't see anything
and I need a flashlight.

I bet Eric Roberts doesn't work like this.

Are we almost there?

It's down this way.

It's down this way.

Stage 17.
Why Stage 17?

That's where Justin
Kirkpatrick was murdered.

It's just a rumor.

Crowbar.
No, it's true.

He really was.

That was a cover up.
Guys, watch your step.

(Mirror shattering)
(Portia screaming)

[Ollie] Shut up, the
security guard will hear us!

It's alright, he's alright.

Security guy is deaf.

He can't hear a thing
just as long as the lights

are out at the proper time, alright?

That's bad luck.

No no, that was Justin.

I know it.

It was Justin.

Enough with the Justin.

No, it was him.

(Eerie music)

Alright everyone, come on inside.

Right this way.

There we go.

Right in slowly.

I know it's dark.

Don't worry, come on.

Madigan, come on in.

Here we go.

Chad over here, come on.

Oh god, I can't believe
we're actually making a movie.

Don't worry honey,
you'll get used to it.

Where's my trailer?

Smells literal ca-ca here.

[All] Ooh!

(Muffled crosstalk)

(mystical music)

Guys, look at that.

What is that?

(Chad coughing)

Comin' from?

Are you okay?
Yeah.

Welcome to Stage 17!

(All cheering)

So many great films shot right here.

Madigan, clear this space.

Can I get a hand?

Where's my camera bag?
I got it.

(Muffled crosstalk)

Comin' through, excuse me.

Yeah, I heard you.
Thank you very much.

Where's prop services?

Yes, right over there.

[Ollie] All you'll do (mumbles).

You wanna help me with
somethin', sweetcheeks?

[Chad] Oh, sure.

What's that?

I bought digicam to
document this historic event.

Great idea, Ollie!

Thank you.

Who is the man?

Can I see that?
Of course, dudie.

Sexy, isn't it? (Chuckles)

You like that?

Oh shit, we have no batteries.

What?
Wait.

No no no, I packed them.

There's no mistake.

There is no batteries in here.

Dude, get the camera out of here.

Chad, would you please
go study your lines?

(Chad mumbling)

I wish I could help, but
I don't know what to do.

I'm just an actress.

A monster?

I'm afraid.

The batteries are in
here, I know they are.

Shit.

No, they are not in here.

Do you wish to insult me?

(Muffled shouting)

No one's insulting anyone.

Gary, where are they, Gary?

I swear I brought them.

I can't fuck with this bastard

if he continues to insult me.

Please do not kill me.

Chad, what are you doing?

Practicing my lines.

Here they are.

(Mumbles) magic, very funny.

C'mon people, (claps)
we got a film to shoot.

Shoot it with your gun

now!

Chad, please!

Go study your lines somewhere else.

I found one.
What?

Look.
Cockroach!

No, it's a bullet hole.

Justin Kirkpatrick was killed
right here in this very spot.

It's sacred.

Jesus, get a therapist, will you?

Steve, where do the actors changE?

There's a dressing room across the hall.

Okay ladies, let's go.

When's lunch?

I need to eat.

Portia, we haven't even
got much time sweetheart.

(Muffled crosstalk)

Alright, here we are.

Look.

I wonder if Justin wore
any of these clothes.

Yeah maybe, just look
for the bullet holes.

I am not wearing any of this stuff.

You don't have to.

Does everybody have clean underwear?

What?

You're gonna be in your
underwear most of the time.

But I don't wear underwear.

Don't worry, I brought
some extra just in case.

So what do you think?

It's you.

Okay, let's all get dressed.

Candyce, are you ready?

Yeah, uh huh.

What's that?

It's my scrapbook on Justin.

God, I love him.

Such a tragedy.

They say it was an accident.

Nobody was murdered.

That's the man.

That's the man that killed
my Justin, Daryl James.

He did, he killed my Justin.

She's just a good actress.

There's somethin' behind you.

No!
Chad, Chad, Chad!

Go to another room far away, please?

It's dark out there and there's spi--

Find a room, turn on the lights,

close the door and I'll find
you when I need you, alright?

Okay,

sir.

Bye, Ollie.

Bye bye.

Chad is quite friendly
fellow, would you think?

He's great actor.

One day superstar, win Oscar.

(Eerie music)

(eerie growling)

(door creaking)

(praying mantis screeching)
(Chad screaming)

Sorry.
I wasn't scared.

(Eerie music)

You okay?

Anybody have any scissors?

Does anybody have scissors?

I think I might.

(Foreboding music)

Hey, get outta here!
Oh my god, stop that.

What are you doing?

Some of your nipples are showing.

Ollie, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

I am making super-duper documentary.

Document this.

Very real.

Very real.

What about this?

(Muffled shouting)

Ollie, get out.

I'm going.

I will to tell you we want
you on set to take you.

We'll be right there.

Okay?

Good.

Document my ass.
Thank you, I will.

Get out.

Hey, where'd you get that?

From your scrapbook.

Give it back.

Gary?
Ready.

Roll camera.
Rolling.

Naughty Sex Kittens versus
the Giant Praying Mantis.

Scene one, take one.

Action!

Cut!

Cut?

Portia, never ever say
cut to the director.

Not on my set, what's wrong with you?

I wanna take a break.

We haven't even started yet.

But I'm thirsty!

Just finish the scene then
you can take a break, okay?

Okay, but I'm working under protest.

Roll camera.
Rolling.

Action!

Oh great spirits of the underworld,

we call upon you to show
yourself in flesh and blood.

Repeat after me.

(Women chanting)
(eerie music)

(gasps) Oh gentle fair one, we see you.

Oh my god, it's Justin!

(Sinister music)

Tell me you got that.

I got it.

It was, it was Justin.

It really was, just like you said.

I told you.

Did you see anything?
No, I saw something.

Think my eyes are playing tricks on me.

Justin.

I saw you.

I know you're here.

Did you have anything to do with it?

Not a bloody thing.

Can we take a break now?

Shit, the security guards.

Kevin quick, cut the lights.

Gary, Gary.

(Lights clunking)
(ominous music)

(crickets chirping)

I hope he didn't see anything.

Madigan, you have got to watch the time.

You guys, where's Chad?

Don't turn around, something behind you.

Run.

Don't turn around.

There is something behind you.

Run.

(Ominous whispering)

(eominous music)

There's something behind you.

Run.

Don't turn around.

There's somethin' behind you, run!

(Film whirring)

You're okay?
Hey,

you guys want a strawberry (mumbles)?

She wants a beer (mumbles).

Yeah right, we'll be back.

(Car horn honking)

(woman screaming)
(ominous music)

(Chad screaming and grunting)
(pickax slashing)

(whimpers) No, no!

(Chad screaming)
(blood spattering)

You guys, what was that?

Chad.

Was that real?

No he's doing his
lines badly, I might add.

Madigan, come with me.

Remember, no lights.

I wonder where they're going. (Chuckles)

(ominous music)

Steve, where are we going?

This way.

I can't see.
Neither can I.

There he is, right on schedule.

I need you to keep watch.

You want me to stay up
here in the dark all alone?

Yeah, that's right.

Forget it.

(Laughs maniacally) I have heard of


C'mon everyone, no lounging around.

We got a film to make.

C'mon everyone, let's get set up.

This is the romantic scene.

Get the lights!

So how was it?

Will someone please find Chad?

Madigan?
Where is he?

I don't know, find him.

Where's the tent?

Where's the bloody tent?

We had it right here.

Chad?

Chad?

You're needed on set.

(Ghastly whispering)
(eerie music)

Chad, is that you?

Chad?

(Books crumbling)
(Madigan yelping)

Chad?

(Intense music)

(Madigan wincing)

C'mon people, we still
got seven more pages to fill

in this hour block and we've
only got 34 minutes left.

Hustle up!

I can't find Chad.

Go look again.

I have to do makeup.

Did you look everywhere?

No, the place is too big.

Let's hope he left.

He wasn't very good.

Fucking actors!

Alright, we can film around it.

He's the lead.

We'll have to make due without him.

Hey Steve, I could do it!

Right, Ollie.

Yes?
Come here.

You, my friend, are
now Hamilton (mumbles).

Goodie gumdrops.

I am now big gonad like daddy (mumbles).

Wait, who's gonna do sound?

Ooh good.

Madigan?

Where's Chad?

I think he went home.

If I wasn't such a committed actress,

I'd be right behind him.

Quiet please, quiet!

And--
I have to pee.

Not now.

Okay, I'll just pee in the tent then.

And action.

Tanya, I've waited so long
to caress your firm bootay.

Oh Hamilton, I've missed you so.

But Darlin', where are the others?

I sneaked out of the slumber party

while they wasn't lookin'.

Ooh, you naughty minx.

I long to mount your molten milk jugs.

Ooh, I long for you.

(Both grunting)

Who's your daddy?

Take me, take me!

Take me, Hamilton.
I will!

(Portia squealing)

Come on.
Stop it!

God what the fuck was that, Portia?

He's tryin' to take my top off.

That's what the script calls for.

I would very much like
to do that scene again.

I don't care, I will not do nudity

unless I get paid for it.

I got a quarter.

Is that what you get paid?

No, but it would be a pay raise for you.

[Steve] Okay, who wants
to stand in for Portia?

(Slaps) Jerk.

(Ollie yelping)

How long would I have to stand for?

I will.

What?

Darlene?

I'd love to.

I feel distress.

And action.

(Intriguing carnival music)

(both grunting)

Take me, take me.
Yes!

Oh Hamilton, take me.

I wouldn't lie to you.
Oh, take me.

I goin' to bite you.

Ooh yes, come on.

Cut, brilliant!

Exceptionally sorry for the--

It's alright.

This will edit nicely.

Now let's finish the scene.

Where's Portia?

Portia?

Portia.

I'm very upset.

What's wrong?

Talk to me.

I have a chemical imbalance.

Here, take a couple of these.

They'll relax you.

Here.

What are they?

It's Somadome or something like that.

I don't remember.

All I know is I'd explode without them.

I need some water.

There we are.

There we go.

There we are.

(Portia coughing)

Take a minute, then come back alright?


Portia, Portia?

Portia.

Look, you're the best
actress I've ever seen.

Even better than Madonna.

I know.

(Somber music)

(man grunting)

And action.

Ooh Tanya, I long to
pounce on the package

of your pulsating action.

The room is spinning.

Daddy has (mumbles).

I think there's someone outside.

Hello.
Hello.

There you are, Tanya.

We were looking for you
at the slumber party.


I'm Hamilton Bigfoot III.

Hello, join me in my tent of love.

I'd love to.

That's it, lovely lovely.

Room for more.

Hello.

C'mon in, girls.
Come to Papa.

What are we doing?

I'm in a bad place.

(Muffled crosstalk)

Perfect, lovely.
Sorry.

(Intense investigative music)

Good, let's get to the exit shots

so we can set up the (mumbles) sequence.

Madigan, how much time?

Two minutes, better shut it down now.

No no, we've got time.

Roll camera and--

What are we doing?

Just climb out of the tent.

Everyone else stay put and go!

Now?

Yes, now.

Go go go!

Me?

Shit, Candyce you just climb
outta the tent fast and go!

(Candyce chuckling)

Cut!

Brilliant, turn off the lights.

The flashlights as well.

Move it, move it.

(Lights clunking)

Candyce, where you goin'?

I'm goin' to see Justin.

Hey, hey, hey.

What are you doin'?

You don't have to hit me,

I was only tryin' to stretch my arm.

She's gone over the edge.

She's great.

Maybe it'll help her performance.

Justin?

Justin.

Where are you, Justin?

Justin, I'm looking for you.

(Foreboding music)

(Portia farting)

Dammit!
Getting out of here.

Eww.
Eww, that's stinky.

It was not me, I am going to (mumbles).

It must've been Portia.

She's the only one still in there.

It doesn't smell like a girl did it.

Portia?
Portia.

Oh my god, the smell killed her.

Jesus Christ.

Portia.

Portia, wake up.

Portia, Portia.

What's wrong, Steve?

She's sleeping.

She's probably tired or something.

She must've been real
tired to sleep through that.

Be nice.

She told me she had some
sort of chemical imbalance.

Probably makes her tired.

Kevin, get her outta the the tent.

We're gonna need it.

Yeah okay, sure.

Justin, where are you?

Come to me, baby.

(Light comical music)
(ghastly whispering)

Right.

When I went to the Chinese man's theater,

I saw your hand print.

I put my hand there, Justin.

I placed it in your print.

You're not gonna believe
this, but it fit perfectly.

It fit perfect.

It was a perfect, perfect match.

(Eerie music)
(stairs creaking)

Plus I needed to come here and tell you

I've been dreaming about you (mumbles).

I've collected everything
of yours from the scrapbook

from the beginning of
your career to the end.

Madigan, he's here.

He's here.

He's physically here in his physical form.

I can see him, I can hear him.

He's walking around me.

Do you hear him?

Ssh, listen.

I'm serious, listen.

Alright, fine.

You don't believe he's here, that's fine.

What's the next scene?

What do we have to do?

We have to get back
'cause we're almost ready.

Why don't you come along?

You think I'm nuts, don't you?

No, I just don't think you
should be here all by yourself.

I'm not by myself at all.

I got my Justin.

I got my Justin.

Here we go, nice.

Easy does it.

Easy, okay.

Alright, sweetheart.

It's called acting from the outside in.

I think for your scene
you should use this face.

That one right there?

Like this?

Oh my god, that's so good.
You like that?

Have you done this before?

No, but I've done this one. (Moans)

I don't see that one on here.

Alright chief, we're
onto the fantasy sequence.

Wait, where?

Company move.

What fantasy sequence?

Script revision.

No dialogue, won't take long.

(Relaxing rhythmic music)

C'mon everybody, right this way.

Here it is.

Here it is.

Ollie, Gary!

Touch me again and I'll kick your ass.

Mind of its own.

I can't control it, sorry.

What's the bed for?

It's a girl love scene.

Oh brother.

Who's fantasy is this?

It represents the changing nature

of the duality of the human animal.

Trust me, you'll understand
once it's edited in.

Sounds like bullshit.

You wouldn't understand, it's art.

Right here, light it low Gary.

I would very much like to
be in lesbian love scene.

I need two actresses for this.

Count me out.

I'll do it.

Not you.

Darlene?

Sure, what the hell?

I'll do it.

Come here, sweetie.

Candyce?
Want to get down with brown?

Candyce?

No I don't think Justin
would like that, would you?

Rebecca?

Steve, c'mon.

You just shoot the pictures, Gary.

Rebecca, sweetheart.

Why do I have to do it?

Why can't Ollie do it?

Tell me when this is done.

Lemme talk to you for just one second.

I just don't know how this
could be good for my career.

What are you talking about?

This could be the best thing

that has happened to your career.

How can that be?

Truest test of an actor is when an actor

has to play a role that
is in direct opposite

to that actor's real character.

You mean if I had to play a man,

then it would make me a better actress?

Exactly!

You hit the nail on the head.

In this scene, the giant
mantis has you so terrified

that you take solace in
the arms of another woman.

You are like a man making
love to that woman.

But I don't have a--

It doesn't matter just as long,

sweetheart, as you believe it.

Nobody will notice.

Ooh,

I get it.

Okay, I'll do it.

That's the spirit.

(Darlene purring)

And action.

Rebecca, go over to Darlene.

That's nice.

There we go.

Darlene, (mumbles), there we are.

Kiss her.

Good, good.

Slowly bring her down to the bed.

There we are.

(Darlene and Rebecca pleasurably moaning)

(Steve drowned by music)

Right there, right there.

Take her (mumbles).

(Rebecca and Darlene moaning loudly)

(Steve drowned by moaning)

(Madigan drowned out by moaning)

Cut!

(Darlene and Rebecca breathing heavily)

(soft, romantic music)

Oops, wrong way.

(Chanting in foreign language)

(ghastly whispering)
(foreboding music)

(bats fluttering)
(Trish screaming)

Jeez, fuck!

(Water trickling)
(both chuckling)

(door squeaking)
(ominous music)

(both yelping)

You scared us.

Sorry, we need you two back on set.

Alright we'll hurry, won't we? (Laughs)

Sure. (Giggles)

(soft sensual music)

(chuckles) Okay, alright Portia.

Gonna have to move this a
little bit here, there we go.

Nice and easy.

(Kevin mumbling)

Gotcha.

Oh god, okay.

Oh god, this is strangely arousing.

Reminds me of seventh grade gym class.

Oh, can I get a towel please?

I'm getting the creeps in here.

You getting the creeps?

I keep hearin' noises like somebody else

is in here with us.

Me, too.
You, too?

There's so much film history.

If I concentrate, I can hear the sounds

of all the horror films gone by.

It's like we're invoking the spirits

of all these dead filmmakers.

It will permeate the fabric of the story

and get into the blood of my film!

Video.

Yeah, whatever.

Okay, are we ready?

Where's everybody at?

Goddammit, late again.

Kevin quick, cut the lights.

(Lights buzzing)

(snorts) Huh?

We're gonna get caught.

He's already makin' his rounds.

Where the hell is Madigan?

I thought it was this way,

but it all looks the same to me now.

Oh wait.

Whoa!

Oh my god, Rebecca.

Check this out.
Wow.

Oh my god, check this out.

Wow.
This is so cool.

Ooh cool.

Oh my god.
Look at--

Oh my god, I haven't seen one of these.

Oh look at this.

(Tape whirring)

Cool.
Woo!

Yeah.

You shouldn't have done that to Rebecca.

You know she's not very smart.

You took advantage of her.

Gary, the process of filmmaking

is a process of discovery.

Rebecca made a discovery tonight.

It's a beautiful thing.

I do completely agree with you, Steve.

I, too, want to discover her boobies.

(Honky-tonk music)
(both chuckling)

Cool.


(Muffled speech)

(retro dance music)

Ooh, I like that beat.

Woo, yeah!

(Rebecca screaming)

Justin?

Are you waiting for me?

Justin?

[Justin] I'm here for you, Candyce.

I can feel you.

We were meant to be together.

[Justin] Forever.

(Chuckles) I love you so much.

[Justin] Candyce, come to me.

Do you wanna see me naked, Justin?

[Justin] Yes.

Ooh. (Moans)

(door creaking)

I'm here for you.

(Door slamming)
(Candyce gasping)

Justin, is that you?

[Justin] Candyce, I'm here.

I think I hear you.

Are you in here, Justin?

Justin?

Are you in there?

Are you coming for me?


(eerie music)

Do you wanna touch me?

(Ghastly whispering)

(Candyce yelping)

Ooh, what the--

I can't believe you did that to me.

You're such an asshole.

(Rhythmic music)

You keep your filthy hands off of me.

Not my fault.

Hey!

Where the hell have you been?

Steve.

We went three minutes past the hour.

The security guard was already
makin' his bloody rounds.

You should've been here to tell me.

You have a watch.

Whatever.

Kevin, get the lights.

Where's Rebecca and Darlene?

They were showering.

Go get them!

I will be really happy to get them.

Shit no, you stay here.

I have a feeling they'll be a while.

Why?!

I don't think they were
done enjoying themselves.

Jesus, nice goin' Steve.

Fuck it.

Alright, alright.

Who do I have?

Candyce, Trish and me.

Not you.

Fuck, how can I have
five girls go into a tent

and only two come out?!

Kevin, wake up Portia.

Portia, Portia.

Gotta come back.
I wanna sleep.

Steve wants you back on set.

Come on.

(Hand slapping)

Oh!

She ain't comin' back, Steve.

I'll make three.

I said no.

Go get Rebecca and Darlene right now.

No.

What?
No!

No more Rebecca.

I'll even take the camera with me.

You just shoot, Gary.

I'm the director and I make the decisions.

Try me.

Steve, why don't you let Madigan do it?

Who's gonna do sound?

C'mon, lemme do it.

I don't mind being naked.

Nobody wants to see you naked!

I am one person who would
like to see her butt-naked.

Shut up!

Trish, go get Candyce.

C'mon, (claps) let's go, let's go!

Portia.

She can sleep all she wants,
we just need her body.

Kevin, go get her.

Okay.

Putting on the buttocks.

Ass first, ass first.

Ooh, me so horny.
Ooh yeah, there you go.

Come on.
You get her?

I am (mumbles), oh god.

Is that good for you?

Where is Madigan?

(Sensual saxophone music)

Yes.

Who's gonna do sound?

Be a true independent filmmaker.

Go (mumbles) 95 using existing sound

that the camera mic picks up.

Alright.

(Singers vocalizing)
(sensual music)

C'mon Candyce, right this way.

Here we are.

C'mon sweetheart, yes.

Alright, where's the blood?

In the tent.
Great, great.

Remember girls, look dead
when you're supposed to.

Alright, inside the tent.

Here we go, come on.

Ladies, Kevin?

I am ready, Steve.

And action!

(Praying mantis growling)

[Candyce] Ooh Hamilton,
you haven't had enough?

(Girls screaming)

Don't stop, keep on goin'.

Cut!

That was brilliant!

There we are.

Take her outta the tent, just like that.

Alrighty, that's it.

That's it, yes.

You are taking her back to your lair.

Remember, you are the
giant, evil praying mantis.

Continue on.

Very good.

(Portia thudding and farting)

Good, c'mon Portia help me out here.

I'm so tired.

Oh god, Steve is such a jerk.

(Water trickling)

(chuckles) That tickles.

I have to pee.

(Light accordion music)

Ooh shit.

Ollie, what are you doing here?

Excuse me, please.

I'm only here because the
toilet is not working.

Poo-poo will go everywhere.

Get out, get out!
Poo-poo is going everywhere.

Get out!

(Ollie mumbling)

Get out!

Here Madigan, you can put her head here.

You're a good person, Madigan.

At least somebody notices.

Yeah.

How'd you hook up with Steve anyway?

We had an editing class together.

Hey look, here I may
be oversteppin' my bounds

but he doesn't really seem

to appreciate you for your talents.

He's awfully mean to you.

I know.

He won't even cast me
in one of his movies,

but I guess he's the genius.

Why do you say that?

Because he always tells me he is.

Why would he lie? (Chuckles)

(Kevin chuckling)

(Portia snoring)
(soft somber music)

I am so sorry.

That's okay.

I'm such a dork.

No, that's okay.

[Steve] Madigan!

(Grunts) Damn!

Justin,

where are you?

[Justin] Come to me.

Justin?
Yes.

Come to me.

I'm comin' to you.

Yes.
You won't regret this.

(Ghastly whispering)

Come into me, baby.

Justin?
Hi, Candyce.

What do I have to do to be with you?

[Justin] Find me.

Justin?

[Justin] Find me, Candyce;
I'm here waiting for you.

Candyce.

Come inside, be together forever.

I'm here.

I'm inside, Candyce
I'm comin' for you.

Justin,

I'm here.

Where are you hiding?

[Justin] Come to me, Candyce.

Find me.

Come on, work work. (Screams)

(Justin laughing maniacally)

Gary, lights.

Madigan, Candyce has wandered off again.

We're gonna need her for the final lair

of the praying mantis.

Now go find her!

Quickly, c'mon!

Steve, I am about ready...

Okay.

(Foreboding music)

(scoffs) Shoot.

(Ghastly whispering)
(ominous music)

(intriguing music)

(ominous music)

What the hell?

What is that? (Wheezes)

(Trish gasping and breathing heavily)

Don't spill the blood.

Are you gonna help us?

Anything you need, Steve.

Look, find Trish.

She's gonna have to play
queen of the moth eaters.

Steve, I would very much like

to play king of the moth eaters.

Trish?

Hey.

Where are you?

Goddammit.

(Ghastly whispering)

What the fuck?

Oh Jesus Christ.

What the hell is this?

I found it hidden in the
dressing room recording.

Whose is it?

It's Ollie's.

Why was it in the dressing room?

Why do you think?

We undress in there.

My cousin (mumbles),

he owns this site buldgingboobies.com.

I wanted to make some money on the side.

Over my dead body!

Steve please.

Can we hook this up to the monitor?

What for?

Maybe there's something here we can use.

I think I should go now.

Find Trish!

She wasn't in the dressing room.

Well go find her!

I can't believe you!

What do you want me to do?

I have a film to finish!

Where the hell is everybody?

Fuckin' where's Ollie?

Go find him, we need our leading man!

I'm gonna find him and rip his guts out!

Bring him back first,
maybe we'll film it!

(Door slamming)

Alright Steve, it's ready.

I wonder what Chad looks
like under those tight pants.

(Mumbles) he's your type.

What do you mean?

What, you haven't seen
the way he looked at Ollie?

You mean he's--
Yeah.

Huh.

I wonder what Ollie looks like

under those baggy plaid pants.

Eww, gross.

Steve is such an asshole.

I got my uterus adjusted today.

Really?
The doctor did it.

It was really wild.

He like pressed on my stomach

and he pushed my leg over kinda like that.

It's just so cool.

Alright Steve, c'mon
this stuff is private.

Gary, you must learn that in filmmaking

nothing (chuckles) I mean
nothing is private. (Laughs)

(door creaking)
(foreboding music)

Trish, Candyce?

Ollie?

Oh shit!

(Security guard grunting)
(intense music)

(Ollie whimpering)

(door banging)

(eerie music)

(Ollie screaming)

Alright, this is boring.

Nothing I can use.

C'mon people, let's go, let's go.

What the hell?

What is that? (Gasps)

Tell me it's not real.
Jesus Christ.

Is this is one of your
fucking games, Steve.

Honestly, no.

Tell me it's not real.

Look, this is what we're gonna do.

We're gonna get everybody and
round 'em up and leave, okay?

Why?

Where are you going?

Steve you just saw that, right?

(Weeps) Trish.

What about the movie?

(Stool crashing)

The movie?!

Candyce, Chad, Darlene, Rebecca.

There's someone else in here.

With black boots and dark pants.

(Ollie screaming)

(pipe clanking)
(Ollie whimpering)

Gary, Gary, wait up!

We should stick together!

C'mon, Madigan.

Gary!

What about my film?

Gary!

Gary!

Gary!

What about Ollie?

We have to help him!

What about my film?

Fuck your film, come on!

(Security guard grunting)
(foreboding music)

[Kevin] Gary!

Gary, no!

Ollie.

(Door rattling)

Dammit!

(Ominous music)

Come on!

(Muffled shouting)

He's this way.

(Madigan screaming)

Oh my god, Trish.

Oh shit, who's doing this?

Portia? (Grunts)

Get up.

C'mon, you gotta get up.

Gotta get up.

Good, gotta go.


(Foreboding music)

[Kevin] Gary!

Fuck.

Shit, come on!

(Spear swishing)
(ghastly whispering)

Here!

(Ollie whimpering)

There's someone down here.

(Ollie wincing)

What are we gonna do
when we get to save him?

We can try.

(Eerie music)

(mumbles) door.

(Ollie screaming)

(muffled crosstalk)

Come on, we've got to get outta here.

Shut up!

(Foreboding music)
(door creaking)

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

(Muffled chanting)

(blood squishing)
(Ollie grunting)

(blood trickling)

Open it, Steve.

Madigan, you go ahead.

I'll cover you.

(Door squeaking)

(Ollie thudding)
(Madigan screaming)

Steve.

(Intriguing music)

(knife swishing)
(Portia screaming)

Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh.

Be quiet, do you wanna get killed?

(Muffled screaming)

Be quiet.

Be quiet.

If you're gonna rape
me, don't scratch my face.

I'm an actress, you know.

It's cold in here, I need another blanket.

Mother.

Ooh, fuck.

Don't try anything weird.

I'm not into that stuff.

Go real slow 'cause I have
a moisture deficiency.

Don't try to kiss me either.

I don't want any of your icky germs.

Oh and bring me water when you're done.

(Winces) Ow.

Wear a condom.

I don't wanna have an ape baby.

Come on, get dressed!

What are you doing?

We gotta get outta here.

Come back here and finish
what you started, you bastard.

Shut up, Portia.

Don't you tell me to shut up!

Nobody tells me to shut up!

I'm leaving!

Portia, come back! (Thuds)

I'm not coming back until you apologize.

Portia!

Portia, come here!

(Ominous music)

Portia!

Portia, Portia!

(Light bonking and jingling)

(foreboding music)

(yelping softly)

Portia.

Portia!

Portia.

It's me, it's me, it's me.

Where's everybody?

We have to get out.

(Eerie music)

(gasps) Shit.

(leg cracking)

Ow!

(Pitchfork grinding)

(gate rattling)

Ooh, please.

(blood sloshing)

Madi, try the door.

(Ominous music)

This way, c'mon.

Whoa.

(Madigan yelping)

Oh my god!

(Eerie chanting)

Candyce.

They're all dead!
Let's get outta here.

(Foreboding music)

(laughs) Welcome to Stage 17!

(Audience applauding)

A movie will never join

the great ones.

Masterpieces!

Torture Chamber.

Attack of the He-Woman.


Maniac.

Motorcycle Mutants.

(Steve laughing maniacally and screaming)

(blood spattering)

Cut.

Steve showed me this room.

Can we go out through the window?

[Madigan] It's pretty high.

Madi, isn't that his car?

What time is it?

It's quarter after, he
should be there by now.

You're right.

Listen.

His radio's on.

He's not dead after all.

Let's get outta here.

(Security guard growling)

(Madigan mumbling)

Go go go go, Madigan go!

(Boards crashing)
(intense chase music)

Kevin!

(Fists thudding)
(both grunting)

(lamp smashing)

Kevin,

hold on!

(Board cracking)
(ominous music)

Go go, run for the gate.

Run.

(Gate rattling)

(gun blasting)

(blade whooshing)
Go!

(Intense music)

Go!

(Madigan whimpering)

(intense orchestral music)

C'mon.

(Tires screeching)

Anyone else get out?
No.

(Siren wailing)

Oh shit.

(Tires screeching)
(cars smashing)

I know who the security guard is.

Who?

It's Daryl James

Who's that?

Do you remember in Candyce's scrapbook

the face was X'd out?

That's him.

You mean the guy who shot--

Yeah, the guy who shot--
Justin?

(Muffled speech)

(gun blasting)
(window shattering)

(intense chase music)

(cars smashing)

Shit.

(Madigan shouting)

Madi.

Just in case.

(Intense chase music)
(tires screeching)

Kevin, what's the plan?

Just keep your head down.

(Gun blasting)

(cars smashing)

Madi!
Whoa!

(Water splashing)

Kevin!

(Gun blasting)

Kevin!

(Both grunting)

You killed them.

You killed them all, you son of a bitch!

I didn't.
Then why are you chasin' us?

'Cause I thought you killed them.

I thought you were deaf.

I may be deaf.

I'm not dumb; I read lips.

So why are you were
listening to the radio?

So people think I can hear.

Get out of the way,
I'll knock his head in.

Madigan no, he's not the killer.

What are you talking about?

He followed us 'cause
he thought we were.

Look, look.

He's got brown shoes, not black boots.

You're Daryl James, aren't you?

Yeah.

They said you disappeared after Justin--

Justin tried to blow my brains out.

That's how I lost my hearing.

me and he give me a job.

If you didn't do it
and we didn't do it--

Whoever did it, must
still be back at the studio.

Oh my god.

Oh my god, Portia.

Hey, where is everybody?

I need some water!

Hey guys, look!

I found your ghost.

Justin, woo!

Hey!

Where'd you guys go?

Trish?

(Chain squeaking)

Steve.

Where are you?

You guys playin' tricks on me?

(Foreboding music)

I don't know how I got hooked up

with such a bunch of losers.

(Anchor whooshing)
(Portia screaming)

(intense music)

Folks shouldn't fuck with a man's house.

It ain't right.

Shouldn't fuck with him.

Ain't that right, Justin?

Ain't that the truth, huh.
