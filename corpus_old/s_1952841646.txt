<i>I'm just a kid.</i>

<i>There's a lot I don't know.</i>

<i>But one thing I do know...</i>

<i>is my folks never</i>
<i>should have married.</i>

<i>And they definitely should've</i>
<i>never had a kid.</i>

<i>But they did. That happens.</i>

<i>The randomness of life</i>
<i>and all that.</i>

When the chicken's up, I'm gonna
go out back and work on my boat.

<i>Maybe they started out trying</i>
<i>to be good parents. I don't know.</i>

<i>But my very first</i>
<i>memory in life is...</i>

<i>how much my father</i>
<i>loved that damn boat.</i>

<i>Here he is hundreds of miles</i>
<i>away from any real water.</i>

<i>And even then we're talking</i>
<i>about the Gulf of Mexico.</i>

<i>Just seemed sad to me, somehow.</i>

<i>And my mom has been psychotically</i>
<i>obsessed with movie stars...</i>

<i>to a point that</i>
<i>defies explanation.</i>

I could use a bath.

Well, go take a bath.

<i>Note that she was going</i>
<i>to take a bath...</i>

<i>the shower was</i>
<i>out of the question because...</i>

<i>two years ago</i>
<i>some pipe in our shower broke.</i>

<i>My father could've fixed it...</i>

<i>but he was so tied up</i>
<i>working on the boat...</i>

<i>he hired this</i>
<i>Marlon Brando plumber instead.</i>

<i>And the shower never got fixed...</i>

<i>as if it just</i>
<i>never happened.</i>

<i>Then there was</i>
<i>the Paul Newman thing...</i>

<i>when our roof needed fixing.</i>

<i>And, of course...</i>

<i>our roofing problem</i>
<i>never got fixed, either.</i>

<i>And how could I forget the day</i>
<i>Audrey Hepburn came over...</i>

<i>to help my mom</i>
<i>with the books.</i>

<i>On second thought, I'd really</i>
<i>rather not get into that one.</i>

<i>It's not their fault,</i>
<i>if you think about it.</i>

<i>It's not like they sat down</i>
<i>and had this conference about...</i>

<i>whether they'd get married</i>
<i>and bear a son or not.</i>

<i>Anyway...</i>

<i>the story is that years ago</i>
<i>my father was a traveling salesman...</i>

<i>that just happened to stop</i>
<i>on one Christmas Eve.</i>

<i>My mother was engaged to the son</i>
<i>of a pharmacist over at Lubbock...</i>

<i>and he chose the night</i>
<i>of the Christmas dance...</i>

<i>to confess he'd fallen in love with</i>
<i>this cheerleader from Texas Tech.</i>

I sure could use
a hot cup of coffee.

I just made a fresh pot.

<i>So, she was vulnerable</i>
<i>that night.</i>

<i>You can't blame her for that.</i>

That is some good,
good coffee!

Thank you.

And that's a handsome coat.

To say nothing of your pretty dress,
which I love, by the way...

because of the way
it matches your eyes.

Not exactly.

Well, of course not exactly,
it'd be too obvious.

We both know that's not
the kind of woman you are.

<i>Was their meeting some fated day</i>
<i>that would magically find us...</i>

<i>happy one day,</i>
<i>like a real family?</i>

<i>No, it's not the way</i>
<i>things work.</i>

<i>That much, I figured out.</i>

<i>My mother had just come from seeing</i>
<i>"Splendor in the Grass", I think.</i>

<i>She went to the movies every day,</i>
<i>and we only had one theater, so...</i>

<i>whatever was playing.</i>

<i>That's when it happened...</i>

<i>and it changed my life forever.</i>

Help me.
Better get her inside.

Hospital says
it will be about a week...

till we can get her down to Galvenston
where her grandparents live.

We appreciate
you taking her in like this.

It's the right thing to do.
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

<i>It's strange.</i>

<i>My folks can't remember</i>
<i>they're married half the time...</i>

<i>and for them I'm just</i>
<i>a ghost flipping around the place.</i>

<i>Then they go and agree</i>
<i>to take in this girl...</i>

<i>whose parents died</i>
<i>in the accident...</i>

<i>'till she got better.</i>

Come in, please.

Brought you stuff for dinner.

Are you aware I have
a partially lacerated liver?

Do you even have the slightest concept
of what that does to one's appetite?

Not really.

My liver is
partially lacerated but...

I don't have a clue
what it does to your appetite.

It probably can't help.

I'm not hungry.

OK.

I'll just leave it here for you.

My parents' bodies were
sent back to Amarillo...

for burial, I take it.

How was the accidente listed
on the official police report?

Speeding...

driving while intoxicated?

I'm not really sure.

My father was a heavy drinker,
you know.

No, I...

didn't know that.

Well, now you do.

That was one goddamn accident,
that's for sure.

What?

You never heard
anyone cuss before?

Well, yeah, but...

not from a girl.

Well, I'm very flawed.

Extremely flawed,
if you want to know the truth.

<i>I looked up the word</i>
<i>"flawed" in the dictionary.</i>

<i>I kind of knew what it meant but,</i>
<i>after reading the definition...</i>

<i>I began to wonder if</i>
<i>maybe I was flawed, too.</i>

<i>But the strangest part was</i>
<i>that for the first time in my life...</i>

<i>I started to feel something</i>
<i>for someone other than myself.</i>

<i>It scared the hell out of me,</i>
<i>if you want to know the truth.</i>

<i>But I liked it.</i>

You were screaming.

It's late.

You should go back to sleep.

Jesus!

You're not screwing
with me, are you?

What?
You seem to like me...

which is fine, because
I like you, too, but...

if you're acting like you do
because my parents are dead...

and you feel sorry for me,
then that's just bullshit.

Hello?
No.

I'm not screwing with you.
I like you, too.

Good.

I think it's time
for us to leave.

Leave?

Look, those two people
you live with...

they're nice and everything...
My parents?

Right.

But from what I can tell...

they don't really have
anything to offer you...

and they certainly
don't have a thing to offer me.

So, where are we going?

Baltimore.

I have an aunt
and an uncle there.

I haven't seen them
since I was five but...

from what I can remember,
they're extremely hip.

But I thought when you got better
you were going to go...

live with your grandparents
in Galvenston.

Look...

Ben...

there's what happens to you in life
and there's what you make happen.

It's the difference
between having a plan and not.

Do you see what I'm driving at here?
Yeah. I think so.

Good.

Well, I'm used to getting up
at the break of day...

being all melodramatic
about this.

How much did you get?

25 bucks.

Well, it's 25 more bucks
than we had before.

That's true.

See, a real plan is more
than just some pipe dream.

Pipe dream?

A pipe dream is
an unrealistic fantasy...

that deludes oneself into thinking
that it's an actual plan.

It's a very
popular expression.

I'm surprised you've never
heard of it before.

I didn't say I never heard it.

Anyway, a real plan
is an actual goal...

that you believe in enough
to create a set of circumstances...

which leads you to
and into a plan.

Do you understand?
Where do you come with this stuff?

I mean, what part of your brain
works so hard...

that it makes you
think and talk like that?

My father was a professor
with a very wide vocabulary...

and lots of unique ideas.

When he wasn't teaching
the students, he taught me.

So, what did your mom do?

She never did anything.

You know...

I think most
of what you say is true.

Some I just don't understand.

But I also think you like
to screw with people's heads.

I may be wrong sometimes...

but I won't ever
screw with your head.

Ever.

Me, too.

Ever.

Take a look at our
new home, farmboy.

Here?

See that pan over there?

It's a hoghouse.

Now, why would
a perfectly good hog...

not be outside
on a day like this?

So you're saying
they don't have any more hogs?

I'm making
a calculated deduction.

So, what's your plan?

It's important.

I need to know what kind of plan
you have for your life.

My wife saw you
come in from across the road.

She made you these sandwiches.

There's a well
by the gas tank if...

you need water.

How much do we owe you...

for room,
and board and water?

I imagine going to sleep...

to the smell of pig shit
ought to do it.

OK.

I want to be a pitcher
for the St. Louis Cardinals.

So, you'll be a pitcher
for the Cardinals?

I like that plan.

Do you know how many kids my age
want to play in the Major Leagues?

No.

But I don't think it matters.

I'm just saying it's more what you'll
call a pipe dream than an actual plan.

Are you any good?

I'm always the best
in my league.

Is it what you really want to do?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Then, it's not a pipe dream,
it's a plan.

Learn to embrace it.

Cassie?

Did you know Joe Nuxhall is
the youngest guy ever...

to play for the Major Leagues?

Yeah.

He started pitching for
the Cincinatti Reds at 15.

This is correct. And more than once
you're gonna break his record.

Try hitting the corners. You're putting
everything right down the middle.

I'm not putting everything
right down the middle.

Come on! It's the seventh game
of the World Series.

Bottom of the ninth.

Bases are full,
two out.

You've got two strikes up.
One more strike and he's yours.

And you know the only pitch you could
throw is the outside slider...

because that's the only pitch
he won't be expecting.

What?

I don't know how to throw a slider.

You kind of hold it off center...

middle finger on the seam.

Then you throw it
like a pass ball.

Come on, giddy up!

We don't have all day.
Coming! Coming!

I think you should
tell me what's going on.

It's not part of the plan.

<i>I'm sick of this!</i>
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

<i>Say something to me.</i>
<i>I have had years of this. Years!</i>

Now I'm going to town tonight.
That's what's happening.

What's the problem?

Yelling is extremely
destructive to a relationship.

You think you're communicating
at the time but...

the effect is
completely the opposite.

<i>No more talk! We have</i>
<i>nothing left to say.</i>

Are you listening
to what I'm saying?

Yes.

We will never
yell at each other.

Hey, don't make promises
you're not prepared to keep.

I'm supposed to try it, you know.
It goes without saying.

But I just said it anyways.

The Hardy Boys.
Now there's some heavy reading.

I like the Hardy Boys.

Come on, let's get some sleep.

Got a big day tomorrow.

What's happening tomorrow?

We're getting married.

Cas...

Yeah.

Are we really
getting married tomorrow?

I mean, actually?

Yes.

It's a major part of the plan.

OK, now.
As I understand it...

you two want to spend
the rest of your lives together...

as husband and wife.

I think we should've done
this days ago...

but you know men
when you rush them.

So...

do you, Ben...
Benjamin Reynolds.

Benjamin Reynolds
take this young woman...

Cassie Kennington.

Do both of you promise to...

treat each other
with dignity and love till...

one of you drops dead?

I do.

I do.

Then...

Well, I suspect you're
both married now.

I suspect you're right.

Oh, the ring.

Congratulations to you both.

Well, I feel good
about this whole thing.

How about you?

Yeah, I feel good about it.

Well, I don't have a lot
to compare to, but...

yeah, I feel good.

Oh, if you want to kiss
the bride...

you can do that now.
I guess I forgot to say it.

I haven't kissed anybody before.

Don't worry,
I'm not ready to have sex yet.

Nice looking at that slider.

I still have to practice.

Missus not here?

She's in town
at the library.

She figures I ought
to learn how to write so...

I have something to do
when my baseball career is over.

Sounds good to me.

Sorry, there's not much
padding in my glove.

You 12 years old?
I'll be 13 in a few months.

Well...

I got to leave today and...

I don't know when I'll be back.
But the wife...

it's fine with her if you two
stay here as long as you need.

Why isn't your wife going
with you?

Well, she...

I'm not a good person,
I don't think.

I've lived a clumsy...

selfish life.

You seem like an OK guy to me.

Here you are.

Show me...

that slider
like you did yesterday.

Can I ask you something?
Sure.

Did you start out
thinking you were good...

my age, I mean?

I like to think I did.

To be honest,
I don't really know.

I like that pitch.

What's wrong?

I just don't understand
grown-ups sometimes.

If that's the lesson to learn,
I think he hates himself.

Come on, let's pack up
and keep moving.

You two headed somewhere?
Baltimore.

It's a large city in Maryland.

I got an aunt in Baltimore.

We're in that green station wagon
next to the pissers.

Our dad got
a bladder transplant last month.

Trust me, it's been more like a metal
cook convention than a vacation.

I don't mean to be forward...

but have you have been experiencing
any bladder problems yet, Sheriff?

No, I have not.

Well, you're at the age
when you should think about it.

Ask our dad.

He's over there screaming
into the urinal right now.

She might be right. You're not
getting any younger, you know.

Well, I'd get five years
out of my life if you just...

shut up five minutes.

Get your things
and get in the back.

Now...

I don't know much...

but I do know I have
a right to your names.

And I know we have
a right to an attorney...

preferably one familiar with the laws
of Arkansas concerning minors.

I'll ask you one more time.

Real slow, real nice.

What are your names?

Like I said before...

my husband and I
respectfully plead the 5th.

Hey, chief, why does she keep
calling that boy her husband?

I don't know, Ward,
and I don't care.

Well, we actually got married
last week.

Nice to meet you, by the way.

Raymond Ward.

The pleasure is mine.

Ward, do you think it's possible
to get past formalities...

and try to figure out
what to do here?

I warn you, put that away before
you blow somebody's head off.

What?

When we get
proper representation...

we'll be more than happy
to give you our names.

Oh, girl.
You're not under arrest.

So, there's no need
for an attorney.

Fine,
then we'll be leaving now.

Please sit down...

and you don't move
until I tell you do.

Am I getting through to you?

Yes, sir.

That goes for the both of you.

You read me, boy?

Yes, sir.

Well, all right.

What's going on?
She's having a seizure.

She what?
She'll be all right...

unless she swallows her tongue,
and then she could die.

How do you know she's going
to swallow her tongue?

I can't tell from here.

OK, then.

Just get in there and take a look
at her to see if she's swallowed it.

Come on!

Oh God, did she
swallow her tongue?

She swallowed it.

Oh Jesus, ain't she
swallowed her tongue!

Get over here!
Come on! Come on!

OK, cradle her head
with your hands.

What's that going to do, bud?

I'm going to try
to pull her tongue out.

OK?
I don't want her to die.

Listen to me!

Don't move! OK.

Here we go. Are you ready?
I'm ready. Get her tongue out.

Ready?

Kid...

Kid!

You son of a...

Kid!

<i>Damn it!</i>

I wonder if those cops
are still looking for us.

Or maybe when you leave the state
they don't really care any more.

Not unless you're
in some sort of a crime spree.

I'm pretty sure breaking
out of jail once, you know...

doesn't make it
into a crime spree.

Your brain is accelerating
at such a high rate of speed...

that science is probably
incapable of measuring it.

What?

Are you always going to have
this attitude? I just want to know.

As we travel through life, we adopt
many attitudes, as you call them.

That's my theory, anyway.

I think you're hiding
something from me.

I am.

Well...

what?

My chastity...

which you will never have,
no matter how much you plead.

Oh, yeah,
like I've been pleading.

That's a laugh!
It's a real big laugh.

Your fast ball
doesn't have the same pop.

I'm throwing against a barn...

probably built
during World War II.

Hey, darling.

Memphis, Tennessee?

Head East till you hit 63...

then go South.
In about two hours you're there.

Jackie boy!
I found ourselves a navigator.

Where are you two headed?
Baltimore.

Jack boy! After Memphis,
we're going to Baltimore.

What's the story?

They're taking us to Baltimore.

Could you get the bags?

Thanks.

Thrown Newman
had some level...

where's the actual life?

Satisfaction will do it, but that's
more awareness than living.

I never thought
about it that way.

So, what made you
become a writer?

I was in love with a woman.

I'd recommend both highly,
but use your judgment...

when dealing with
toxic pleasures of any kind.

Here you go, cowboy.

What about him?
Is he a writer, too?

No, he just lives his life
and everything seems to work out.

Yeah?

Sure is nice being up bright
and early to take in the new day!

Yeah. That's what they say.

Where are we, anyways?

Life in Hell, Kentucky.

By the way,
did I ever thank you?

Because it'd be way too comfortable
for me and my body...

to be in a nice warm bus...

heading exactly where
we want to be going.

We're married, you know. That's
supposed to count for something.

He was a nice guy, sweet talked.

It wasn't like
I kissed him or anything, geez!

You know? Whatever!

Jealousy.

It's a good trait
to have in a husband...

unless of course he gets
overly possessive.

Why don't you just
rest your tired ass...

and let me make the calls
for a little while?

Tired ass?

Where's that sweet,
innocent youth I used to know?

Don't you worry about it,
he's in here somewhere.

He'd better be.

Can you even imagine
Mr. Teenage Maryland...

riding in our car?

Well, I'll be sworn!

And he was fourth runner
for Mr. Teen America.

Mr. Teenage America!

Tell us about it, son.
We got all the time in the world.

Is Maryland your home state?
Let him tell it.

Actually my cousin's got
all the stories.

Did you know that last month she
walked across the state of Kentucky...

on her hands?

She doesn't look like she's in shape
to the corner from what I see.

That's how she got hurt.

She was just a mile
from the border...

when this cow just broke through
a fence and started trampling her.

My Goodness!

Must have been one, what's it called...
Brahman.

Brahmans can be real mean sometimes.
Let him tell it now.

But she wouldn't stop
till she got to that border...

even though her arm
was fractured in seven places.

"Ripley's Believe it or Not" is
coming to her house next week...

to interview her about it.

Pull over.
Pull over?

We still got a long way to go.
I said pull over.

I want to get in the back seat
and talk with this child.

"Ripley's Believe it or Not".

Can you even imagine?

Well, I'll be sworn!

Almost there.

Yeah, couple hundred miles.

I can't tell you how pleased I am
with the way things have gone so far.

What's going on
with that arm, anyway?

It's all right,
just a little swollen.

Jesus, Cas!

Why can't this wait until
we get to Baltimore?

Because your arm
is about to fall off.

The fracture's healed...

there is some severe inflammation
around that cut, young lady.

Here you are, daddy.

Where exactly around here
do you two live?

A few miles from town.

Our father was laid off
in the paper mill so...

money is a little tight
right now.

What paper mill?

You really are a good brother
to have brought her here.

Well, she's
the only sister I have.

And I wouldn't trade my brother
for all the silver in the world.

Isn't that sweet, honey?

It is absolutely adorable.

I think that face's definitely
going to break some hearts one day.

How old do you think he is?
My brother is 12 years old...

and I'm very sorry your daughter can't
find boys her own age to play with.

What's your father's name?

Virgil. That's his first name.

Yeah, Virgil Pappas.

I don't know anybody
named Pappas.

You know like we said,
we live quite a way from town.

Call the sheriff, Maris.

There's just something not right here.
I'll get it, daddy.

OK, look...

here is the truth.

Our mother got arrested...

for armed robbery
five days ago in Arizona.

Our father left
when we were little...

and they were going to put us
in different foster homes.

Oh, my!

We've been together
our whole life...

so we just decided to stay
with our cousins up in Vermont.

You better be
telling the truth, son.

You've all just been
so amazingly kind...

I could not lie
if I wanted to.

Once we get to Vermont,
I'll send whatever we owe.

Gratefully.

You are absolutely incredible.

I mean, seriously, it was like
watching "Hamlet" or something.

Maybe you should be an actor
when your baseball career is over.

I thought I was supposed
to be a great writer.

Yeah, don't be an actor.

It's a way too skittish life style.

So, what can I get you
little chickens this morning?

Some silver dollar pancakes
or some piggies in a blanket, I bet?

Two coffees, both black.

So, I watched these people
behind you walk in.

They look like real softies.

I bet we can
catch a ride from them.

<i>Cas was right about</i>
<i>her aunt and uncle being hip.</i>

<i>They seemed to me at least.</i>

Lemonade? It's delicious.

<i>I mean, they took us in out of the blue</i>
<i>without making a big deal out of it.</i>

<i>I'd say that's pretty hip.</i>

Cheers!
Cheers!

Anything we need to go over?

I think with children
there need to be some rules.

Like what?

The only one I can think of
is when they should go to bed.

Midnight?

Sounds fair to you guys?

It seems reasonable.

OK, wait, I mean, let's be realistic.
What about the weekends?

Right.

You know?

Two?

Who goes to bed at two?
Come on. Four.

What do you say three?
Everybody OK with that?

Very generous parameters, uncle.

We won't abuse
the privilege, sir.

I have a most beautiful room for you.
There's a parachute on the ceiling.

It will be like you're in a palace.

Does it have a single
or a double mattress?

It has a single.
We'll need a double.

With my leg stiffening up sometimes
and the two of us being married and all.

You're married?

That must be what kids call
going steady these days.

Oh, no, we're actually married.

Yeah, look.

Was it a large wedding?

Well, about 20 or 30 head of...

mostly hogs and some sows.

Oh, and pigs.

Yes, there were several pigs
in attendance as well.

Well, I guess we'll get you
a double mattress, then.

Well...

Look who's up.

We've recently started
getting up early.

It's a sign of discipline, I think.

You may be right.

Oh, and tell your wife
thanks for the coffee.

It's very good.

I'll be sure to tell her.
Oh, and uncle...

is it all right if we paint a strike
zone on the side of the building?

We'll pay for the paint.

You mean,
like a baseball strike zone?

Yes, my husband's going to be
a Major League pitcher.

Well,
I don't see a problem with that.

Terrific!
Well, have a wonderful day.

You, too.

Both of you.

<i>Don't be nervous.</i>
<i>This is fun!</i>

<i>Okay. Is that all right?</i>

<i>You do wait</i>
<i>to hear if they can handle it.</i>

<i>I'm nervous.</i>

<i>Well, no more waiting.</i>
<i>I think I'm ready.</i>

OK, the show is
about to start, sir...

and your cooperation
is appreciated.

Please remain in your seat or
I may have to call security.

What are you guys up to, anyways?

A pal direct from Paris...

where she has been showing
for the kings and queens...

and the very special
society's elite people...

and the fashion world,
bright as a new star.

Thank you.

I'm so glad you had this dress on
and not the green shawl.

Remember how the glare
had us hypnotized?

I know, I remember.
I kept staring at it.

The dream's glare...

<i>At first, I couldn't really tell...</i>

<i>but Cassie was starting</i>
<i>to slip away inside herself.</i>

Thanks, man.

Come on, Satchmo.

I can't do that.
You played like hell the last time.

I thought Armstrong
himself was in the room.

Yeah, I got goosebumps.
Do it again.

Come on, give it a try.

All right.

Take your time.

<i>When I look back,</i>
<i>it feels like my fault.</i>

<i>Not that I could've</i>
<i>figured out why she was sad...</i>

<i>but not being able to see just</i>
<i>how incredibly sad she really was.</i>

<i>The problem was...</i>

<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what to do about it.</i>

Strike 3!

Good job!

<i>It's like she had</i>
<i>this grip on me...</i>

<i>but was also pushing away</i>
<i>as hard as she could.</i>

I can't find any frogs.

I told you there weren't
going to be any here.

It's funny?

That's funny.

Nice to see you got
some sense of humor left.

How about a towel?

There's a Summer League in Maine...

where all
the Major League's touts go to.

We're heading North
at the end of the week.

If you don't sign in this year...

we'll enrol you in school up there
and get you signed next summer.

Cas, I'll be 13 next summer.

Nobody signs 13-year-old kids.

Sometimes your negativity
just absolutely exhausts me.

What if I like it here
and don't want to leave?

Going to Maine is the plan.
You want to screw it up?

Go throw yourself a party.

How about the towel?

OK, what is the first name
of Ernest Hemingway's wife...

the last one, when he blew
his brains all over the place?

Duke.

Mary.

OK.

Who is the right fielder
for the Cleveland Indians 1959?

Sir Douglas big stick
or something.

Rocky Colavito.

Yes, my lord.

You've almost completely
changed since we got here.

I need to know what's going on.

The real question is why you're
putting it in such a negative context.

Yes, I am withdrawing somewhat,
but is that a sin?

Great.

Take a major problem, even though
you won't tell me what it is...

and turn it into one
of your brainy discussions.

Oh, is that your opinion?

You did finish 7th grade, so I want
to give it the way it deserves.

And you graduated
from Harvard, all right?

OK, cowboy, you want to play?

I'm not exactly sure about
what we're playing here, but...

yeah, let's go.

It's all about introspection...

a concept you're no doubt incapable
of digesting at this point...

in your narrow-minded,
sheltered, pathetic life.

Go screw yourself!

Ben...

What?

You mad at me?

Yeah.

And I don't like it.

Then, start talking to me
like a real person.

I told you I was flawed
when we met.

Cas...

Everybody's flawed.
Just in different ways.

I'm so sorry.

It's OK.

Talk to me.

Please.

Oh, yeah!

Ben, come on.

You look good together.

Hey, Cassie, honey.
Won't you come fun?

Come here!

Come on, Cassie.

Let's show them how to do it.

Come on, shake you tail.

Good.

<i>After a while,</i>
<i>Cassie calmed down...</i>

<i>and went to sleep.</i>

<i>I guess I hoped that</i>
<i>when she woke up...</i>

<i>things would be OK.</i>

<i>But I was wrong.</i>

Time to go, honey.

Come on!

<i>So, Cassie became a patient...</i>

<i>in a children's psychiatric ward</i>
<i>in Virginia.</i>

Ready, front!

<i>And I ended up that summer</i>
<i>in a bullshit Military Academy...</i>

<i>down in North Carolina.</i>

<i>Cassie's aunt and uncle figured</i>
<i>they had to do something with me...</i>

<i>but listening to Louis Armstrong...</i>

<i>and sending a boy</i>
<i>to a Military Academy...</i>

<i>doesn't really chime,</i>
<i>when you think about it.</i>

Reynolds, you're messed.
Tuck your shirt in!

Fix your hat!

Don't look at me,
look forward!

Present arms!

<i>The only reason I stuck around...</i>

<i>was to see if Cassie</i>
<i>would get better or not.</i>

<i>But she didn't.</i>

<i>She'd gone over this edge...</i>

<i>and nobody knew</i>
<i>how to get her back.</i>

Maybe she will.

<i>Then, the state made it official.</i>

<i>Cassie would be put</i>
<i>in a high-risk observation...</i>

<i>ward for a period</i>
<i>no less than 18 months.</i>

<i>18 months.</i>

<i>Unbelievable.</i>

Reynolds,
I told you to grab some polish!

Put that book down.

I told you!

<i>I know what to do</i>
<i>or where to go.</i>

<i>I thought about back home.</i>

<i>Maybe my folks had half the police</i>
<i>in Texas looking for me.</i>

<i>But what did it all mean, really?</i>

<i>They were living their lives,</i>
<i>and I, trying to figure out my own.</i>

<i>The truth is, we never had</i>
<i>much in common, anyway.</i>

Hot chocolate?

Hot coffee.

Thanks.

You're a good kid.

You should see mine, too.
Both boys.

A little bit older than you,
but not much.

Every day I look for even
the slightest sign of humanity in them.

Not a drop.

Where are you headed in Richmond?

Children's psychiatric ward.

I'm going there to get somebody out.

Do the people running the hospital
know that you're coming?

No.

So you are...

going to illegally take someone
out of the psychiatric ward?

Yes, sir.

Who are you bringing out?

My wife.

Your wife?

Look, son...

if you're the one who's staying
in the hospital, it's OK to tell me.

No, I'm married...

and I'll go get my wife out
and take her with me.

Any kids?

No, but planning
on having two eventually.

I'll make it easy on both of you,
take mine.

Same ol'.
Good night.

Hey.

Hey.

Cas...

Yeah.

It's time to go.

Is that the plan?

Yeah.

That's the plan.

What if I'm really,
really tired?

Let go! Let go! That's it!

You took it for as long
as you could, Cas.

You can't blame yourself for that.

There were good parts to him, too.

Cas...

Yeah.

Let's go.

Ben, I'm sick.

When you kill two people,
it makes you sick.

Look, I'm going to take you
out of here and...

worry about everything later. OK?

OK.

<i>Before Cas and I started</i>
<i>the rest of our lives together...</i>

<i>there were a couple of things</i>
<i>I needed to do first.</i>

<i>Sometimes it's hard knowing if</i>
<i>you should or shouldn't do something.</i>

<i>So, you do what</i>
<i>feels right at the time.</i>

My theater!

My boat!

My boat...

<i>Who knows anything,</i>
<i>when it comes down to it?</i>

<i>I don't.</i>

<i>I pretend I do sometimes,</i>
<i>but I don't.</i>

<i>But I do know this.</i>

<i>When your life becomes</i>
<i>what you dreamed it would be...</i>

<i>it's amazing.</i>

<i>I think that walk sealed</i>
<i>D.Q.'s fate here in game five.</i>

<i>I didn't break Nuxhall's record</i>
<i>of playing at 15...</i>

<i>but I did become the youngest guy</i>
<i>that ever pitched in a World Series.</i>

<i>Benjamin Reynolds.</i>

<i>But nothing I did on the field...</i>

<i>compared to what Cassie</i>
<i>and I accomplished together.</i>

<i>It's kind of a miracle really...</i>

<i>having the chance to give</i>
<i>what you never got.</i>

<i>Cas took a job editing</i>
<i>children's books...</i>

<i>and I pitched until my arm</i>
<i>couldn't take it any more.</i>

<i>And, like she planned...</i>

<i>I became a writer.</i>

<i>A lot of what Cassie said</i>
<i>turned out to be true.</i>

<i>Most people do need a plan.</i>

<i>Life is crazy enough without one.</i>

<i>But the hardest part of life...</i>

<i>is losing someone you love.</i>

<i>At first, you almost wish</i>
<i>you never knew them...</i>

<i>so you stop hurting so much.</i>

<i>Feels like it's going to kill you.</i>

<i>What you end up missing the most...</i>

<i>is the sweet burden</i>
<i>of being needed.</i>

<i>It gives your life a purpose.</i>

<i>It really does.</i>

<i>And it makes you feel great.</i>

<i>That's something else</i>
<i>Cassie told me.</i>

<i>It is all a part of the plan.</i>
