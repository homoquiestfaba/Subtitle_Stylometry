Pumpkin, are you okay?

Is that a truck?

Stephen. Stephen.

Well, hello there, darling.

I know you weren't expecting me.

Yeah, that's right.

I followed you up from that
trail a little while ago.

I figured you were coming here
with your short boyfriend.

You're freaking crazy.

Where do you come up with this stuff?

A 10-hour workday is a long workday.

I get a little bored.

So, you're taking me out
to, what is this place?

A place that was important
to your grandfather or?

You've been here before?

What was the deal?

I wasn't really paying attention.

When I used to live on the reservation,

my grandfather used to
take me to this place.

And we would get lost in
the woods for a few days.

He'd take me hunting and
fishing, and all that good stuff.

It's just the woods
that I used to play in.

I grew up here.

I made a lot of great memories
with my grandfather there.

I was just thinking we could
go make our own memories.

Well, I like the sound of that.

All right.

Are you really gonna wear those shoes?

What are you talking about?

These are my lucky chucks.

I was wearing these when I met you.

Well, I got you something.

Oh.

Gray and brown, my two favorite colors.

Yeah, I figured you could...

And it's almost my size too.

Almost.

So, you want me to hike in shoes

that are ugly and don't fit?

Well, this is the point of no return.

You know what I mean?

This is three effing
days in the wilderness.

Do you have, I mean...

Woo, that's a little heavy there.

We gotta carry this for three days?

We gotta small tent?

Are you sure this is okay?

Have you done this before?

How long has it been since
you done this before?

This is kind of-

Hush.

There's worse things to do

than follow that around for three days.

hidden in the silence

I think it's all a show

to show you where to go

over, it's over, it's over

in the distant moonlight

Did I ever tell you
about the pro-wrestler

that I knew from Mississippi?

No.

Back in the '90s, anywhere you went,

no matter how shitty the wrestling was,

people would sell out.

'Cause Stone Cold and The
Rock were big at the time.

And I knew this guy,

and I don't even remember
what his real name was,

but he would show up to the matches

in a sleeveless black T-shirt

with matching black blue jeans.

And then he would have this plastic sack.

And in the plastic sack was
his outfit for the night.

You know what it was?

What?

It was another sleeveless T- shirt.

So he would get into the dressing room,

take that shirt off,

and put another black
sleeveless T-shirt on,

and now he was ready to fight.

So, this guy came up to
me once and he was like,

"Hey Vinnie, I know your good

with all the gimmicks and everything,

and I got the look down.

I know I look good.

But I need an idea that's
gonna set me apart."

And this guy was the worst, he was a dork.

He was a redneck dork.

If there is such a thing.

So I sat there for a few minutes,

and I said,

"Hey man, have you ever
played mortal combat?"

He's like, "Yeah, man,
I love mortal combat."

And I said, "You know,
when you kill somebody,

and it says fatality?"

He said, "Yeah."

I said, "How about for
you, instead of fatality,

because you look kind of like an animal,

how about you go by beastiality?"

He had no idea.

That's cool.
His eyes got big as saucers.

"Yes. Yes."

So that night, he's charged up,

he's excited, he's ready to go.

He goes outside the
curtain, place is packed.

"Who's ready for some beastiality?"

The whole place goes sideways.

The women with their kids, they're like,

"What in the hell are we about..."

They didn't know

if they're gonna bring
out a sheep or something.

They had no idea.

The college aged kids were
laughing their ass off.

He went in the ring, he got the guy down,

the guy was on all fours.

"Who's ready for some beastiality?"

And he never, ever, ever had
reaction like that in his life.

He came back, he hugged me.

He's not a hugger. He hugged me.

And he was saying, "Man,
this is the best shit."

And he goes, "Man, thank you so much."

Word about this guy travels for weeks.

People are driving miles to see him.

"Beastiality."

Place going crazy. "Beastiality."

He's so happy.

And I feel like an asshole,

because everybody's making fun of him.

You're an asshole.

I know.

Then six weeks later, I see him again.

Totally pissed off this time.

I said, "Hey, what's up, beastiality?"

He said, "Shut up. You know what you did."

Apparently, he ran into
some promoter from Ohio

who was a born again Christian.

He did one of the church shows,

where they try to save everybody.

After the main event, they're like,

"There's no way in heck I'm letting you

go out there and say beastiality

in front of a bunch of
born again Christians."

And so, man, he had to give
up the gimmick,

Beastiality.

That's a great story.

Oh, thank you.

You are welcomed.

Where are we going,
girl? You know I love you?

I know you think you do.

What you got?

That is disturbing.

It's weird, being out
here in the woods like that.

Who would leave this out here?

Obviously a guy, and he's
probably looking for it.

To this day

you don't know the difference
between .

I used to live upstairs
from this professor,

and every time I asked him,

he was like-
Hey. What is that?

Oh, it looks like a woman's purse.

Could be full of cash.

Gold.
It's very gender, isn't it?

Okay. It's a gay man's purse.

You got very nice arms.

Thank you.

I'll take that for you.

Ooh. It's filled with Krabby Patties.

Think there's anything on there?

I don't know.

Nudie pics?

You wish.

See if there's a battery in there.

Is that a battery?

I think so.

Beautiful.

I'm gonna eat these.

You want one? There's three left.

No, and that's disgusting.

They're very good for you.

Sponge Bob eats them. He's very thin.

These are like peaches children take.

He's cute.

I want to see boobs.

Oh!

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

We have to get this to the police.

Okay. But where's the police out here?

I don't know. Check the map.

Okay.

Whoa, whoa, slow down
and think for a second.

You know where ranger
stations are and stuff, right?

Yeah, I think so.

It's supposed to be on this trail.

If we just keep walking,
maybe we'll come across it.

All right. Let's go, baby.

That's crazy.

Fuck this Krabby Patty.

Hey man, you all right?

Need some help?

Hey brother, you're all right, man?

What happened?

Twisted my knee.

I come back to my car.

Okay. Where's your gear?

Ah, I left it up on the mountain.

I couldn't really carry it back with me.

Well, I can go get that for you.

Come here. What're you doing?
Everything okay?

Of course not. Call 911.

We can't. There's no service out here.

Go fucking to the clearing, and call.

We gotta at least try.

I mean, I don't know what else
to do with this fucking guy.

I don't have my phone.

You don't have your phone?

I'm sorry, I got your phone.

She's a beautiful girl.

You're lucky, man.

I know, man.

I don't know what she's
doing with me sometimes bro.

I'm a lucky bastard.

I don't either.

Cherokee should stick to their own kind.

Their blood's already polluted enough.

What?

Don't get me wrong.

It's not like that.

The Cherokee breed out,

soon the whole nation will be gone.

Sad, really.

I got no signal.

Let me check with the Mrs.

I have no signal.

Well, I told you to go
to the fucking clearing.

And I know it's 30 minutes,

you've been gone for 30 seconds,

but let me tell you
something, that's okay.

This guy's a freaking weirdo.

I don't know if he can hear me.

So be careful.

But this guy was talking
about you being Cherokee,

and talking about you wiping
out the Cherokee he mentioned

'cause your mom's half white or something.

I was like,

"Is this guy a racist or is
he a soothsayer or a witch?"

And dude, he's really freaking weird.

And here's the other thing,

he looks like my uncle Tony.

You met Tony, right?

Isn't Tony 60?

Yeah, but he looks like Tony did

when he used to bring
to me to these woods.

'Cause I know I hate hiking,

but I fished here before with Tony.

And he looks just like the guy.

It's fucking weird, but
he didn't talk like Tony.

Tony's a cool guy...

Where the fuck did he go?

Did he take anything?

I don't think so, man.

Where the hell did he go?

I really don't even know
how to process this right now.

I don't know how to process it, baby.

We getting the fuck out of this place.

I wonder if that's who's
taking the Polaroids.

I wonder where the nest is.

Honey, I think that's a rattlesnake egg.

Don't tip the woods.

I'm not gonna make it

the last two damn miles to the camp site.

Well, why don't we just hike up there?

Oh, and do a camp for tonight?

Well, what I have in mind,

we might as well stay out
in the middle of nowhere.

Oh really?

Well then, hell yeah.

Wait, what do you have in mind?

What do you have in mind?
'Cause I don't think

it's the same thing I have in mind.

I just rolled my ankle.

9 million miles in this damn forest.

Oh!

My bracelet broke.

Who cares?

That looks like your
grandmother's phone cord.

I was actually hoping that it would break.

Loaded bag.

You said you could put up
a tent by yourself, right?

Yes.

Gotta do manly. I love you.

I'm gonna go secure the
perimeter with my manliness.

Okay. Have fun.

And testosterone.

See ya.

And my balls.

I have an idea, we could eat these.

The finest spawn guy that
cow shit has ever produced.

Four years together,

and he finally talked me into eating shit.

It'll be fun.

Shamans used to use these in ceremonies

when they would walk through the worlds.

Really?

Yeah.

I think you we could use them to connect.

Connect to the trees and the squirrels,

the spirits of the forest.

You wanna do mushrooms out in the woods,

with Polaroid killer out?

Can you think of anything better to do?

Ah, yeah.

We may do that too.

I never felt my nipples like this before.

through the darkest night

when the wolves strike

get your aim right

pound on the fame right

that they ain't got paid

gonna lose it out anyway

of flesh and blood

All hail Lord Leviathan.

Jesus! What are you doing?

Oh, Hey man. How's it going?

Oh, hey, how's it going?

Don't mind us.

You want a piece of this?

No!

What the fuck.

Oh!

Jesus Christ, what the hell!

Are you okay?

Yeah. I'm fine.

Motherfuckers.

What the fuck?

Who was it? Are you okay?

Yeah.
What the fuck, motherfucker?

Come out here.

I'm from Baltimore, bitch.

Hey baby.

Good morning.

Good morning.

You're beautiful.

What's on the agenda today, boss?

I figured we could take the
camera bag and the Polaroids

to the ranger station.

Ooh, that camera bag.
Do I still have that?

Yeah. It's in your backpack.

Okay, cool.

Let's get going.

All right.

I'm thirsty.

Oh, my God!

That was one for you.

Because it's a guy?

Oh, yeah.

Unless you got something to tell me.

This is really starting to creep me out.

It's weird.

But it's just somebody
screwing around with us.

I bet it's an art house project.

I bet there's a candid
camera in the woods.

Rocky and Bullwinkle pulling one of-

I really hope you're right.

I feel like somebody is watching us.

Somebody is watching.

I'd say that Indian voodoo witchcraft.

You feel it in your dreadlocks?

Vinnie, I'm serious.

I know. I just joke when I'm worried.

I have to pee.

Okay.

Snapchat me.

You can go now.

Don't be like that, uh.

Hey, come look at this.

Baby, you're fine as
wine, but I ain't R Kelly.

I'm not into that shit.

Not that.

I wanna show you something.

Okay.

Why don't you bring it out to me,

so I don't have to break my damn neck.

Just look.

It's made out of deer
hide and .

It's like the one my
grandfather used to make.

Cool.

You put it on, huh?

Why not?

A bear could've crapped on it.

Thank you.

You're welcomed.

Be careful.

This one's a doozy over here.

You're a doozy.

Thank you.

That's the nicest thing you've
said to me all day, I'm sure.

Where's this fucking forest ranger station

that I hear so much about?

I don't know.

Everything looks unfamiliar.

Oh, little buddy.

What happened.

Oh, one cute little guy.

You okay?

Moron.

I'm not peeing there.

Freak.

How'd you get over there, Houdini?

What are you doing?

What are you wearing?

This is crazy.

I'm not in the mood to screw around.

Vinnie.

What are you doing? Come here.

Vinnie.

Robin.

I'm not in the mood for this.

What are you doing? Come here.

I never want to hear that

I'm the one that screws around.

This is freaking ridiculous.

Robin.

How did you get up there?

Would you cut it out?

Freaking time getting a role-play.

I ain't moving, my feet hurt.

Hey, what the hell was that?

What were you doing?

What were you wearing?

Why the fuck did you go off like that?

I thought you were peeing over there.

That was crazy.

I almost fell off a cliff!

Some weird ass redneck saved
me, and he disappeared.

What in the hell is going?

And you're wearing that
damned necklace again.

What are you talking about?

What do you mean you don't
know what I'm talking about?

I about died, about fell off a cliff,

a redneck had to save me.

You were leading me through,
wearing this Indian gab,

looking like Sacagawea,

and you're acting like gypsy Rose Lee.

What in the world?

I about died over here.

Then you're wearing-
I have no idea

what you're talking about.

And you're wearing the thing again.

The knapsack.

I'm telling you.
Vinnie, calm down.

What are you talking about?

I about fell off a cliff.

I can't be gone.

Man, just get this stuff.

Let's start walking.

If you got to screw around, man,

somebody could get hurt, babe.

I have no idea what
you're talking about.

I don't know what I'm talking about.

Have you ever almost fell
off of a cliff before?

God almighty! I saw the face of Thor.

It was insane, and Zeus.

Maybe you should watch
where the hell you're going.

Well, maybe you shouldn't be

sexually trying to entice
me off of a cliff face.

Have you ever thought about that?

I'm telling you I have no
idea what you're talking about.

I was peeing.

You know I have a thing for you, right?

I'm gonna follow you follow you...

I thought I said quit
wearing this stupid? -

Don't touch me.

Ouch! What's the
fucking matter with you?

Just leave me alone.

Hey.

Billy.

Go for Billy.

Hey Billy.

Remember you're gonna be on duty

by yourself all weekend.

Is there anything you
need before we take off?

What?

Nothing. I'll be fine.

Y'all just enjoy your big
holiday weekend, okay?

Yeah. Thanks Billy.

Oh, before I forget,

.

Let's see, it was near campsite...

Ah, would shut up.

This is disgusting.

Baby, if you used tampons for
a tent, you're looking at it.

Don't touch it, man.

Hey, you're still a thing.

It's all over that.

I'm not gonna touch it.

Hey, it's forest ranger.

We found this bag.

Yeah.

A while back on the trail.

Yeah.

It's got suspicious pictures of...

Look there's these
Polaroids of people bound,

and naked chicks.

Yeah.

And this bag too.

There's a camera-

Wait, that has my necklace.

Oh.

Buddy, you're all right?

We're talking here.

Uh?

You want us to leave
this stuff with you?

Are people in trouble or what's going on?

You know, there's a ranger station

about a mile, mile and a
half way back up there.

Just take that with you.

You're busy, huh?

Yeah.

I'm working on this big caper.

I'm sorry, is it more
important than people in trouble?

Yeah, big forest caper. Big stuff.

Hey, it's your job, right?

To protect people, and at
least give us peace of mind.

And these people may be in trouble, man.

Aren't you a cop?

I mean, you know what a forest ranger is?

Isn't this your job, sir?

Look.

Just go up to the ranger
station, and leave a report.

I got stuff to do.

Apparently.

Let's go, sweetheart.

Taxpayer money.

All right.

You shoot him, and I cut him.

What the hell did you say?

You shut the fuck up, Scott.

Damn, Scott.

You can cook anything.

Uh, he sure did.

Whose turn is it to follow?

Not me. I cook.

Well, I just got back. So...

I guess I'll go then.

The last that I saw,

they were headed towards
the old town of Proctor.

I'm gonna go take a nap.

Baby.

Robin, look, man, with
everything that's been going on

here in the freaking
woods, I'm freaking out.

I don't want these freaking
photos anymore, men.

We'll just take them
to the ranger station.

I don't wanna touch them no more.

I mean, I really think...

I thought it was a joke at first,

but there's something really
fucking weird in these woods,

I don't want any of it.

Devin?

Is that Devin?

If we're talking
about the craziest stuff

and the scariest stuff,

I'll tell you the scariest
thing I've ever seen.

When I first moved to Tennessee,

the first thing I did is

I was in a judo tournament in Memphis.

Did you win?

Interesting story.

Basically, the guy in the
final, I got on his back,

arching his neck up like that.

And he was screaming going, "Arg!"

He didn't tap out.

And then the little Asian
guys all got around,

And they basically disqualified me,

'cause they said I was trying
to break the guy's neck.

And I was like, "The guy didn't tap out."

And there are supposed
to be some rule in judo,

you can't break a guy's back.

So anyway, I was pretty
discouraged, I got second place.

Here's the scariest thing I've ever seen.

I go back to the hotel

I'm going to sleep it off
and cry all night long.

Head down the hall, get on the elevator.

What do I see?

There must've been some sort
of freak convention in town,

because the elevator was suddenly filled

with a sea of furies,
six or seven of them.

All at once hop on the elevator.

I thought this was weird,

but they must have had
some sort of symbiosis,

because they all turned around

and looked at me at the same time.

And me being a judo guy in a bad mood,

What the hell was that?

I don't know.

Let's keep moving.

do this.

Are you Devin?

What are doing here, baby?

What the fuck!

I don't think so.

Doesn't look like anybody's
been in here in forever.

I'd say about 150 years.

Now what are you basing that off of?

Is that some sort of expertize?

Is it some sort of carbon dating?

Well, it's got a confirm foundation.

I think we should call
a real estate agent.

Man, some ghetto dude
tried to spell Atlanta.

Put that down.

Why? It's got spiders on it?

No, don't try to say that name.

Vinnie, let's get out of here.

Robin.

I don't want to talk about it.

You don't want to talk about it?

What are you talking about?
Just drop it.

Drop what?

.

Drop it.

Hey. You keep your eye on these guys.

I'm gonna see if I will find other guys.

Gotcha.

Where the hell do you think
you're going off to, honey?

Baby we left our shit back there.

I just had to get away.

Okay. I got it.

Sit down. Talk to me for a second.

For the love of God.

What is going on, man?

Are you kidding?

Are you serious?

My grandfather used to tell me a story,

when I was a kid, about
the legend of Spear finger.

They would just tell kids to scare them.

Keep them from going too far.

"Don't go too far kids,

because Spear finger will get you."

She was a rock golem with
a spear for a finger,

made out of obsidian.

She would lure the kids
away from the tribes,

and stabbed them in the
hearts with her finger,

and eat their liver.

Okay.

After that, white people
drove us out of our lands,

and her hunting technique changed.

She started dropping trees on people,

and mimicking your loved ones,

and luring you into the woods to kill you.

Spear Finger.

This is what you're afraid of?

That it's his name?

It's not a real name.

Well, what's her real name?

That name on the board.

Atlanta.

How do you pronounce it?

We don't say that name.

Okay. Let me get this straight.

So, we're afraid. You're afraid.

Your all attitude has changed,

because you're scared of a golem woman

coming in and throwing a tree at us.

Rock golem woman.

What did I say?

Rock golem woman.

.

Well, I saw some boobs.

So weird.

They were man boobs.

Somebody's been here,
like a male polish.

Where Scott, out, huh?

Yeah.

Neither you or him have
a problem with core, huh?

No, man.

You know I used to be a cop.

Oh, did I ever tell you the story?

Do you know who Charlie Hodge is?

No.

He's the guy...

Well, you remember Elvis, right?

Yeah.

So, Charlie Hodge was the
guy that would hand Elvis,

the towels and the scarves on stage, okay?

So, one night when I was on duty,

this guy got stabbed at puckers.

He runs out the back runs cross street,

gets in an elevator at a hotel,

takes it up to about the fourth floor.

I was first on scene.

Obviously, it's easy to find them.

Just blood everywhere.

Just follow the blood trail.

Follow it, it's the elevator.

Second floor, no blood.

Got up to the fourth floor, blood bath.

Look off to the left, there's
this guy laying on the floor,

just bleeding out and gurgling.

So, I go over there, and
I'm putting my hands on,

getting all bloody.

That's how I'm used to blood.

And I'm like, "Oh, I need help."

This guy's dying.

I don't know how quick the
medics are gonna get here.

I look up and there's
an Elvis impersonator,

walking towards me.

Hair and everything.

.

With him, is Charlie
Hodge, believe it or not.

Charlie freaking Hodge, man.

So he walks up to me, and he goes,

"Hey, officer Walks, is
anything I can do for you?"

Suspicious minds.

And Charlie Hodge said,

"Is there anything I can do to help?"

So I look at Charlie Hodges, and say,

"Charlie, give me that towel."

Oh God

What a fuck.

Mother fucker, where you at?

Where are you at?

Where are you at, mother fucker?

What the hell is that?

Baby is this fucking normal?

No, this is not normal.

I mean, if people can do
this on hikes all the time,

this is insane.

I can't see...

Where the fuck is the guy?

I don't see anybody.

And what the hell is that thing?

Did you hear that guy's voice again?

Or am I going crazy?

Yeah. No one heard it.

I got to fucking pee.

This is the worst time.

You're talking about vulnerability.

Baby, give me about a foot.

I'm gonna little pee shy.

Okay. All right.

This is your area of expertise.

What do we do first?

Well first of all,

you tend your brass knuckles around,

the other way, dumb ass.

Okay. Now what?

It looks like...

The sky looks like it's
gonna be dawn soon.

So, I say we just sit outside,

and see if they come back.

Okay.

That's a good idea.

So, staying awake, okay?

I don't think that would
be a problem at all.

Vinnie.

Wait, wait.

Y'all need to get out of these woods.

I don't think it's safe here.

Is that a threat?

What do you mean?

People are going missing.

Now, the cops ain't talking about it.

Maybe they aren't reporting it.

If they do, they're just
saying it's rock slides,

trees falling down on people.

Or what are the odds of that?

There is something else
going on around here.

There's a killer.

You've seen the pictures.

How do you know we've seen the pictures?

Wait, are you the one
messing with our tent at night?

I just got here five minutes ago.

As far as I know, you're the killers.

And as far as you know,

I am.

That's really cute,

coming from somebody out here by himself.

I ain't alone.

Where'd you guys get that camera bag?

We found it on the trail yesterday.

Put the bag on the ground and walk away.

That's okay.

We're just gonna give it to
the ranger, if you don't care.

Look, we're armed to the teeth.

Just drop the camera bag, walk away.

We don't want anything to
happen to you or your girl.

There's only two ways out of here.

We're going that way.

I better never ever see you again.

Okay. It's official.

Those guys are creepier than
an elevator full of furies.

Let's just get our
stuff and get out of here.

Wait. I didn't know...

Robin, this is the fucking
thing I was talking about.

The rednecks, hillbilly-

They're not rednecks.

What do you mean?

They had non-slip shoes on.

What the hell does that...?

I didn't notice their shoes.

I was looking at a nine-foot
machete in my face.

I was waitress for eight years.

So, you're saying rednecks
can't work in a restaurant?

I only heard one of them
speak with a Southern accent.

I don't care if they're the
bodyguards of Jesus Christ.

I'm not-

Let's just get our stuff and go.

All right.

Hey do you want this?

I don't want to see that, man.

Here, you take it.

I don't want it.

Robin, baby, stop.

I don't know what to do, man.

I don't know what to freaking do.

These guys could be
following us right now.

Yeah.

I know you've been saying
it for three hours.

What?

Am I supposed to kick three guys' ass

with machetes this freaking long?

We can focus on the problem,

or we can focus on a solution.

There's just something

that the giant said that stuck with me.

What is it?

He said something about
trees, falling on people,

and rock slides.

And?

Well, do you remember
the story I told you,

that my grandfather told me?

About the rock scrotum?

About the rock golem.

Robin, baby, we ain't got time

to deal with his bullshit, man.

I'm gonna kick three
motherfucking men's ass.

Really?

Got the flashlight on

in the middle of the day, Travis?

And it's fine.

I'll just go down to the ranger
station and charge it later.

Hey man, you know what I miss?

What?

Air conditioning.

Hey, you know what
we'll be doing right now,

if we're back in the real world?

Hmm?

I'd be telling your dumb
ass, to roll some silverware.

I still wouldn't do it.

Man, day shift 60, night shifts 75.

Get it done, son.

Did you look at the camera?

Yeah.

As your friend, you don't need to see it.

I have to know.

Let's just go get those fuckers, man.

Was it her?

Yeah.

Seriously, man.

Let's just go get those
motherfuckers right now.

It's fucking on.

Wait where the fuck is Scott?

I thought he was with you.

Shit.

Beer.

You didn't drink.

My nerves are shot.

Do you think these beers
belong to those guys back there?

God, I hope so.

Why?

Because rednecks don't need more beer.

Did you hear that?

I think that's him.

We gotta go.

What the hell are you doing?

My brother escaped a bear
attack doing this once.

Just trust me.

He called this making a dummy of a dummy.

He's got them bad jokes.

All right.

That should slow them
down and confuse them.

Let's go.

What the fuck is this?

This is his clothes?

Right.

There is something in the pocket.

No, no, no, no.

We are gonna kill you.

Hey, what are you doing?

We got to keep moving.

Hey baby. What's wrong?

Oh my God! They're gonna kill us.

Hey. Hey.

Hey, babe. I got this.

Listen. Sweetheart, look at me.

Look at me, Robin.

I got this baby.

?

I'm gonna isolate him, okay?

I'm gonna hit him with one left hand,

and then two right hands.

And then it's going to be on.

Please stay out of it.

And I'm gonna reap his face a part.

He won't know what's up.

And then I'm gonna bite
him on that fathead of his.

And then it's gonna be the time

to call bigy and the ball guards, baby.

'Cause I'm gonna get him under the chin,

and draw him on his bad ass.

And then I'm gonna put him in figure four.

I'm gonna break your leg.

I'm gonna break your damn leg.

You son of a bitch.

And then the big guy is gonna see

what I'm doing with the other guy.

And he's gonna say,

"Not the figure four, I
don't want any of that."

And he's gonna run away like a bitch.

Okay?

We're always save.

Everything's gonna be okay,

but we gotta start moving.

We gotta start moving now, okay?

All right, baby. Get your bag.

There we go.

We can make it.

We're almost there.

Everything's gonna be okay.

Run!

Shit.

I think we lost him.

Looks like he's going the wrong way.

over here.

like five minutes.

So, we're gonna have to kill them.

I mean, yeah, we have to.

I can't believe they got Scott.

Yeah. Her too?

I think she's
more dangerous than he is.

Yeah.

They could have turned off at the Canyon.

Man, if they hit
that Canyon, and they're gone.

There're caves on there.

I don't do caves.

Tight spaces, bad shape.

And I don't like caves at all.

We could probably head
them up the .

I'm gonna head down to the cave.

What the fuck.

That's gotta be them.

Go, go, go.

Let's go.

Hey, look. There's another Polaroid.

Let's go hiding in here.

Sure.

No.

Man, we are
just walking in circles.

Man, this sucks.

Oh, here's that Canyon
he was talking about.

They'll never find us in here.

Which way back?

Do you remember?

I think we go that way.

Robin, wait, wait.

A big red dick.

What the fuck is that?

Come one. We gotta go.

What the fuck!

Oh, my God!

Is that the same dick?

This can't be the same dick.

We're moving around in circles.

This cave is a straight line.

It doesn't make any sense.

What the fuck do we do?

Which way do we go?

There's not been one turnover.

How are we in a fucking
circle over and over again?

Okay.

We've been walking through
what feels like endless.

This is flash drier spot.

I don't care.

Looks great.

I lost the fucking tent.

It's all we have is the sleeping bags.

Well, we've been running a mile, huh?

I don't care.

Let's just lay down, lay in it.

I ruined my brand new shoes.

You know, one of us is
gonna have to stay awake.

It's so quiet in here, man.

We'll wake up if we hear anybody.

I can't sleep in the silence.

So, why not just maybe...

Good luck.

You know what happened last time?

I love you, Robin.

I know you think you do.

Even through all this stupid shit,

if we live through the night...

This has actually been a lot of fun.

It hasn't been fun, but you
know what I'm trying to say.

I'm glad if I had to
do this shit with you,

let's put it that way.

Me too.

All right.
Good night.

Good night, baby.

Sweetheart.

What are you doing?

Oh my God.

You're beautiful.

So, beautiful.

What are you doing?

What's going on?

Come here.

Where are you going? Come on.

What's gotten into you?

Okay. Where are you going? Come here.

Let me touch it.

You look so good.

What are you doing?

What has gotten into you.

I like it, but it's weird.

All right.

You look good.

Where the fuck did you go?

Robin.

Robin.

Where'd you go, baby?

Did you find the way out?

Robin.

Did you fall?

Sweetheart.

Baby.

Thank God! Lights.

Robin.

Robin.

Robin.

Robin, sweetheart.

How the hell am I gonna get out of this?

Robin.

Vinnie.

Vinnie.

Oh, my God! Where's the lighter?

Vinnie.

Vinnie.

Vinnie, this is not funny.

Vinnie.

Vinnie.

This is not funny.

Hello.

Robin.

I know that's not you.

Robin.

Come to daddy. Stupid bitch.

Fuck! Oh, no.

Vinnie.

I found it.

I Found the way out.

Oh my God. Vinnie.

Vinnie, wake up.

Vinnie, Vinnie.

Vinnie, wake up. Vinnie.

You son of a bitch, you
took the flashlight.

Where have you been?

I don't know. Help me up.

What happened?

I don't know.

Now we found the exit,

but how are we gonna get through it?

There's another exit.

It's just around this way.

The town should be half a mile this way.

Come on.

Okay. You lead the way.

You wouldn't have a
tail on you, would you?

No.

You know we travel a lot.

Oh my God, it's a road.

I think we're close to town.

Good, because I'm about to pass out.

Let's go.

No baby.

This ends here.

No more running.

You can't, Vinnie.

He's a giant.

Baby, I'm Baltimore bad.

I love you.

I know you think you do.

Kick his ass.

Com on, Vinnie.

This ends when you die.

Move Vinnie.

Get him, babe.

Get up, Vinnie.

Get up.

You stay with me through the shit.

No!

No! Please, don't kill him.

I'm coming for you.

in the woods, messing
with me and my girlfriend.

What's wrong with you people?

Come on!

I took out your giant,
I'll take out you next.

Vinnie!

No! Vinnie.

Oh, my God! No!

Motherfucker.

You, motherfucker.

Vinnie!

Vinnie!

Vinnie!

No.

Vinnie!

At least we stopped you.

You can't kill anyone else.

What?

You had his daughter's camera bag,

and we found the Polaroids.

No, we didn't.

Where the hell did you get that?

I found it down the river earlier.

Oh, I thought it was
one of the Indian things.

Such a dick.

I told you we'd get out.

I'm falling down!

Oh!
