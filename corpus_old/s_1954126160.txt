PACIFIC COAST

Eight years!

Hey, little ...
How old are you?

19 years, sir,

two spent in this country.

Countries ...

In these countries ...

In this land ...

And your master?

Leave, leave ...

How?

He became what,
your captain?

Ah, Narváez ...

Death!

And with him, more than 600 men.

It has been hard ...

Living so many years
among the wild ...

Eight years ago in Florida

What assembly, gentlemen!
What meeting?

What grace and sweetness ...

And our clothes, sumptuous

are enhanced with the gold of India!

Blessings Cross
and the holy Veracruz

and the Lord of truth
and the Holy Trinity!

Blessed is the soul
which the Lord provides!

Blessed be the day
that the Lord sends us!

Ships?

All lost!

Is that all Spain
that remains?

These boats are Spain ...

Where ...

Where ...

are the other boats?

Ahoy, mateys!

There!

There!

I see a shadow!

It Narváez!

Here!
Captain!

Ahoy, mateys!

Here!
By Here!

Here Captain!

Over here, Captain!

Another annoyance, Alvar Núñez?

Captain, at this speed,
can not follow you.

So what do you suggest then?

To tie a rope to our raft.

Considering ...

that your men are younger
and more robust.

Listen, Treasurer

This is no time
give orders.

From now
that everyone here ...

This seemed preferable
to save his life!

You're the captain!

And those lives ...

you were assigned!

Think men in the boat!

They are sick and exhausted.

Give me the oars!

Grab it!

You are warned, Don Alvaro.

It's every man for himself,
there is more authority.

Here ends Spain.

Ramez, you!

Captain Narváez,

the smallness of your soul
equaled

the enormity of your selfishness.

Heals your language
fucking priest!

I tend,

but my last words
will be for you.

Here ends Spain
you say?

Well,
ends here for you too

hope of eternal life!

Good navigation, laddie!

Stop!

What assembly, gentlemen!
What meeting?

Stop, you get drunk
for days!

Stop! And then die!
Go to hell!

Leave him alone!

Ground!

Earth ...

A place to die.

You can not burn.

Collect all the wood
as you can.

I said no!

Stop, Alvar.

His body is still warm.
You're crazy!

Why not burn my blood?

It's the same blood!

I act in the name of God!
I know what I do!

In the name of God? You answer
your actions to Him.

This is bad.

What they want me,
these dogs?

Do not take it!

Let me go!

Let me go!

Remember ...
Go to Panuco.

Still to Panuco!

Do not take it!

Remember ... Panuco.
