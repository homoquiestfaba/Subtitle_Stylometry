There is this theory.

Given an infinite univers
and infinite time...

all things will happen.

That means that every event is inevitable

including those that are impossible.

that's as good explenation
for all this as anything else.

Now, a lot of stories start in bars,
so that's where we are going to stars this one.

Not because that I was there.
I wasn't.

But because it is a dam good
introduction to a vary unique...

fella.

Legends of every major culture,
all contain some sort of character

whose purpose is to grand wishes.

except Americas.

The Arabs have Jinni's...
The Irish have Leprechauns...

The Chinese have dragons and monkeys...
The Europeans have ferries and wood sprits.

What do we have?

Santa Clause?

Santa Clause just brings presents,
he doesn't grand wishes.

See he grants wishes.

Zak, saints predate American culture,
he doesn't grand wishes, he makes deals.

All right, I give up.

What do we have here?
No one.

That's my theses.

Our culture is unique in having no such mythology.

Oh you're wrong my friend.

Excuse me?

There is a fella in America,
who grants wishes.

Ad only one to a customer.

And who is this fella?

O.W. Grant.

That's his usual name,
he't got many others.

And he's a loose sun of a bitch.

You'd get easier time
finding a Jinni.

So how come, we've never heard
of this O.W. Grant?

You haven't heard O.W. Grant,
'cause America, is a much younger place than

Ireland or Arabia...
not too many people have had the chance to meet up with him.

Let me gess
You have.

I met him out at interstate 60.

Accidental. That's his way.
Folks don't find him, he finds them.

He just kinda happens in to them,
and they don't know, who he is or what he does...

until he does it.

And mostly messes with them, plays tricks,

'cause that's his way too,
but sometimes...

if he takes a shine to you...
he'll play it strait.

Now, one story says,
that his daddy was a Leprechaun...

came over here with Irish.

Now, midgets are notorious ???..

This leprechaun goes and knocks up a Shien Indian...

Shien get the land taken away
in the end up with the immortal, nomadic

half-breed with magical powers.

Interstate 60, you said?
Yhm

So, what does this O.W. Grant look like?

Red bow tie.

He smokes a pipe,
curved in an image of a monkey.

Maybe you'd be better of writing your theses
without mentioning O.W.

He'd probable rather not have
people known about him.

You got it.

Good night.

Hey Quincy, check this out

There is no Interstate 60.

I 65, 64, 66, and 69.

No I 60.

I guess tonight's everybody's fool-of-shit night.

Guy with a red bow tie and a monkey pipe,
who grants wishes...

Right.

No, damm it, look,

I need, that bidding before twelve...

yeah it's critical, just,
right call West...

Holy shit!

Broken jaw.

I'm sorry myster,
I didn't see you.

Are, are you OK
como on?

Are you all right?

Jesus.

Don't!
Stop!

Oh man!

My bike!

Look, I'm sorry
I'll pay

Oh God damm it!

Oh God damm it!
Look at my suit.

Oh shit...

Oh fuck.

I've got a sails meeting at 11 o'clock,
this is a fucken disaster.

My phone
is my fucken life line.

God damm it!

Oh I say everything happens
for a reason.

May I gues,
I just needed a new bike.

I, for one, did not need this shit
in my life.

Not today.
Of all fucken days!

Oh God damm it!
I wish, this had never happened!

I wish, it hadn't happened... I wish, it hadn't happened!

Was that your wish?

If you had a wish,
you wished, this hadn't happened?

Fucken-A right!

Granted!

Mr. Baker.

How did you know my name?

yeah, I need the bidding before 12...

yeah it is critical...

look, just call West
have him fax it to the main office...

Get it...
Speak up, I can't hear you.

I said...

Some people just don't know what to wish for.

As for my part in this storie,
well, it began on a Tuesday.

September 18th.

My birthday.
My 22 birthday to be exact.

Oh, I'm Neal Oliver.

And this mess, is my apartment
in St. Louis. Missouri.

Where at this particular moment
I was at MajorDecision.com.

Should I wear a tie to lunch?

Damm.

Happy birthday Neal.

Truth.

You are not mad,
that I'm bailing on you tonight?

No, no no no.

I mean how cool it you be for you,
to bomb your pshytest because of some stupid concert

No aa. You have got to wait until lunch.
That is your family rules.

But you can open this.
I intercepted your snail mail.

It's the reality check.
I'm game over on the art scholarship.

We should at least open it.

I can tell a rejection by weight.

You are the wrong sex, the wrong colour
and your family has too much money. I'm sorry.

Just don't, don't mention anything
to my old man, please.

You are so wired.

What?

Well, you actually suppose to cut your grapefruit in half
and eat it with a spoon

not peel it, and eat it like an orange.

Oh look... it's her.

Again.

Should I be like jealous?

Oh, maybe if she was real.

So, I had another dream about her,
last night.

She was in jail...
it's got to mean something.

I'll tell you what it means.
You saw her once somewhere

and made a subconscious impression,

the impression came back to you in a deam,
so you drew her

which made the impression stronger.
You dream, you draw, you draw, you dream

Now it's a vicious cicle.
So quit drawing her, and it lid.

Well, thank you Karl Young.

Fact is, I enjoy drawing her.

But, am I...
Am I any good at this Sally?

'cause today is the deadline of the Conrada Competition.

Should I even inner these?

Don't ask me Neal.

I don't want to be judgmental.

But I do know, that just because you enjoy doing something,
doesn't necessarily mean that you should make it your career.

Should I enter a painting in a Conrada Competition?

Here,
No worries.

As I said it all started on my 22 birthday.

Specifically here.

At my traditional birthday lunch.

As always, my father has picked the restaurant.

Attending with the usual suspects.

Sally, who my parents actually liked
mabey even more than I did.

My dad. Daniel.
Atterney at law.

My mom. Marleen.
Atterneys wife.

And my sister
and best friend Nancy.

Put on earth by the grace of God,
to keep me from going insane.

So what did you wish for?
Please tell me that it was something about us.

I'm guessing...
He wished to go skydiving again.

God forbid.

Oh no, Neal you didn't.

Why, if I tell her, it wont come true.

Actually that's no wife's tail.

The truth is, you should always tell your wish.

Kinda Carma thing.
Put it out there, project it.

Then it just might come true.

Never heard that before.

Oh, it's true.
Believe me.

I know.

I'll cut this for you.

OK, so now you have to tell us.

Yeah, come on,
tell us Nelo.

I wished for...

an answer.

An answer,OK
an answer to what?

An answer to my life.

Here it is.

Happy birthday son.

Your admition
to the Bradford Law Fellowship.

Just do the interviev
next month, on October 15th,

and you're in.

It's all aranged.
By me.

And you can take that to the bank.

Dad, I told you,
I wasn't sure yet.

Well, I can be sure for the both of us.

Last candle gone.

Take it with you.

That is,
if you want your wish grant.

Thanks.

Oh, cool.

That's my color too. Thank you.

Sable brushes.

Nanc.
You are the best Nanc.

You are welcome.

As for last.

Happy birthday son.

Isn't it perfect?

Fire engin red.

You have no idea,
how hard it was to find a red convertable in this town.

Fule injected. 160 KM.
Phone.

Yeah, I even got you special plates.

Oh boy, I would have killed for a car like this,
when I was your age.

A, you know I thought it was high time for an image changen,
and what better way to start.

Now, you see, the engine is a 2,5 liter...

As usuall,
it was all about him.

His idea of cool.

Red was his colour.
Not mine.

It was his pet fraze on the licence plates.

Clearely he was excepting me,
to become him.

Well? Isn't it the best present,
you could ever get?

It's awsome.
Come on Neal, take me for a ride.

Well, son...

Neal!

Oh my God!

Son!.

Somebody call 911.

Neal, Neal,
are you all right?

Talk to me son.

Neal.

<b>Get better soon honey,</b>
<b>Love Mom+Dad,</b>
<b>XO</b>

St. Louises finest increst.

You're all right Neal?

Yeah, yeah, just...

it only hurts when I think.

They want to keep me overnight,
to log some tests in the morning

make sure,
my perception is like worked, yeah.

You're goddess, Nanc.

I know.

So, what's your perception
of a dad

who buys you the gift,
he wants for him self?

About the same as toxic wastes.

Your perception is fine.

That is one hell of a way
getting out of answering dad about the car.

Mom and dad are going to be here soon,
what are you gonna tell them?.

Lies.

The truth just gonna piss him of.

Well maybe that's a good thing.

No, no.

Because then I' gonna get the hole riff,
about how I'm letting him down

It's just easy if I role with it.

And maybe someone will steal it.

First a little visual warm up?

I'll hold up a card, you name the suit.
I'm gonna go faster and faster.

Let's see if you can keep up.

OK.

Diamond.

Club.

Spade.

Hart.

Diamond.

Spade.

Diamond.

Hart.

Club.
Spade.

Hart.

Diamond.

Club.
Hart.

Spade.
Diamond.

Club.
Spade.

Hart.

Club.

Spade.

Hart.

Did I pass?

No.

But a few people do.

Black harts, red spades?.

Come on,
that's like cheating.

Aa, experience has conditioned you,
thinking that all harts are red,

and all spades are black.

Because their shapes are similar.

It's easier for your mind
to interpret them...

based on that passed experience.

Then open to an idea that they can be different.

We see what we expect to see.

Not necessarily, what's really there.

Children,
who have never played cards, always pass this test.

Makes you wonder how many other things
are right in front of you, sight, sound, smell

that you can't expirience,
because you've been conditioned not to?

If we'll do the test again
you will pass.

Once you are aware,
that their can be black harts and red spades,

you'll be able to parse them.

Your brain is wired,
just like the Interstate highways system.

It's easy
to go from one well to the other place

But the places in between, off the highway.

Even thou they're there, most people just zip right pass them.

Well, that's cool trick

But there aren't any card games with red spades and black harts.

Well, how do you know?

Mr. Oliver.
I'm Dr. Craig.

You ready to take some tests?

Yeah.

Well, that was,
some wormer beck you got there, that guy Rey.

Who?

Ray...
you know, that guy, who was, he just left.

You know, the tricked cards.

No, there is no one on staff, named Ray.

No, he was just here.

Wacky guy, with the cards...
with the light-green lapcote.

The staff wears blue here,
not green.

But we can test your color perception.

Dropped seven of harts.

Come on in son.

So, how's that new car?.

Awesome?
Yeah dad... it's very awesome.

What is on your mind, son?

I'm not so sure
about this Bradford thing, dad.

Seams little too easy, you know.

I spent years working very hard,
so it would be easy for you.

What? You want to work nights
in that warehous for the rest rest of your life?

Come on dad,
that just so i don't have to ask you for cash.

Son, let me give you
some Daniel Olivier philosophy.

And you can take it to the bank.

When ever someon ofers you an advantage,
take it.

And this program is an adventage.

It will get you
to any law school in the country.

America needs another lawyer.

Another good lawyer.
We can always use one of those.

That was costs 30 000?
32 200.

I out bid two major collectors,
to get it.

It's a lot of money for a drop cloth.

That shows you how much you know
That is Franklin Samuel original.

He's a name artist.
If you ever sell anything,

the operative wolud been if,
maybe... maybe... your opinion will count.

Look dad,
I'm just not sure, OK?

I thought about,
maby taking some time off.

Time off for what?

Sort of take stock, you know,
tray figure somethings out.

Wast your time with your art?

It's a hobby son.
Would you live it that?

Look, I got you into Bradford,
because Prat's on the bord,

and he wont be next year.

So if you don't take adventage of it now,
there wont be a next time.

Why not just go thru the program?

If you ultimately decide, law school is not for you,
then, I'll... live with it.

But at least you'll be Bradford ???
and that's something you can always take to the bank.

Then you can... figure things out.

So you're going Bradford, ha.

I thought you weren't sure.
I'm not.

I think it would be stupid,
not to at least give it a shot.

Can't let down the old man.

Bouth you of a fancy car?

He's maximaizing his options Hrank,
It's very mature.

We should be saportive,
not judgemental.

Look for the good in your felloman.

The warm wind of romance
blows around you.

With good helth,
prosperity will follow.

October 15th.
That's the day of my Bradford interviev.

Let me see that.

OK, you got me.
It's blank.

What the hell?

I would never get on that shit, never.

Just, leve everything behind,
not know where are you going.

I can't believe that you would Neal.

Just, leve your friends,  and your family,
and for what?

Hey, earth to Neal.
What's the matter?

Sally my fortune.

Didn't it say:
October 15th, are you sure?

Obviousely it didn't.

At the restaurant, when I showed it to you,
isn't that what it said?

Why do you make such a big deal about this?

Because it is bugging me.
That's why.

You're just projecting your anxiety, about your decision,
and that is natural.

It's OK.
You'll do grate.

Because that's who you are.

Here.. Just take a nice deep breath, relax.

Sally, listen to me.

What are the chances?

That of all cookies in that kitchen,

that exact one ended up on a plate,
that was taken to our table,

and I picked it?

It was blank, Neal.

The fortune was blank.
You projected.

I projected?

Right.

That was the politicaly correct way to say I was seeing things.

I worked graveyard shifts at the grocert wearhouse,
filling orders for the trucks to take to the verious stores in the morning.

I liked it for three reasons.

I got the job on my own.

It paid enough,
that I didn't have to ask the old man for cash.

And it annoyed Daniel
that his son was even working at such a low-clas job.

I hear you are quit'n
to become some big shot lawyer in new fancyass car, hm?

Well, lucky dud.

Hey, Curby.
Get the kid a brake.

You just remember that
no mather haw hard shit you think you are,

Its always gonna be more the same.

Another Highschool.

Highschool?
Hell yeah.

Everything in life is like Highschool.
The're just chang'n names.

You take this place.

Insted of pronciple,
we've got boss.

Insted of teachers,
supervisors.

Insted of asignments,
they give us work orders,

and, if you fuck up them work orders you,
get fired.

Insted expelled.

Oh yeah, names are different,
but it is exact same shit.

Highschool.

Damaged goods.

Well, store can't sell them.
Guess I'll just have to take it of their hands.

Is he right Otis?
Is everything more the same?

Yeah, if you look at it like that.

I mean, look at me,
I show up here, see the same people,

take shipement to the stores,

see those same people,
eat at the same places,

see those same people...
but not really.

See.

I like seeing those people.
Well most of them any way.

If I want something different,
I can make it different, go a different way.

Eat at a different place,
do an Interstate gig.

See I never went to highschool...

Look at them.

In the morning thay will get up,
and go to the store.

And the paste will be on the shelves where it always is,

and not one of them will give
a moment's startles to how it got there.

Holy shit.

That's her.

I must have seen her on the bilbord,
and that's how she got in my dreams.

You dream about her?

Yeah,yeah,
Yes.

Pretty silly, huh.

Maybe it means something.

Like what?

Like the thunderbolt, you know,
love at the first sight.

Come on Otis, that's just ferrietales stuff.

That's how I met my wife.

Spotted her in a crowd at the river fornt,
4th of July fireworks.

Couldn't take my eyes of her.
Fireworks were up there,

but I was stearing at her.

And I just knew.

Well. See, all my girlfriends,
are awlays a reaction to the one I had last.

Jennet was so opinionated about my art,
it drowe me crazy.

So I found Sally,
who refuses to be judgemental about it.

Meanwhile she's
trying to psychoanalyse my.

So she is not the one either.

Maybe you should go after her?

Girl like that. She's a model,
she's probably got guys fallen all over her

Guys with big portfolios.

Yeah, I think it's kinda childish idea.

Chasing a dream.

Hi, your bilboard on Delmar&Wicker's,
the one on the side of the building?

Yeah, whose adagency is that?

No, no no... Next to the Casino Queen bilbord.

The girls with the phone,
says: There is another choice

Blank?! No, no It can't be blank.

I was just there.
I just saw it.

No, I just saw it!

Hey, what is the sign on the right said?

What, are you nuts?
It's blank man.

<i>Neal Oliver.</i>
<i>Your appointment has been scheduled on tomorrow.</i>

<i>September 25th. 10 AM .</i>
<i>555 Olive Street.</i>

<i>Suite 1300.</i>

<i>No rescheduling.</i>

<i>- Neal Oliver, your appointment...</i>
Who is this?

Hello?

Hello?

<i>10 AM. 555 Olive Street.</i>
<i>Suite 1300, no rescheduling.</i>

Morning, Mr. Oliver.

Why don't show, you actyally show up.

Not everyone does.

Ray?

I've got a job for you.
If you want it.

Drive cross country.
Delive a package.

Right, what the gell is going on here Ray?
Because I'm seeing things on signs...

In firtune cookies...

I mean wird messages...

Black Harts, or red Spades.
I told you, you can see them now.

What's it all about?

It's all about you, Neal.

It's all about you.

Here's the job.

Misspelled Denver.

Yeah, I know.

OK, so why my?

Why not FedEx?

What's in here, any way?

Can't really say.

Yoy can't really say, because you don't know,
or you do want, and don't want me to know?

Either way, the result is the same.

So what is this job pay?

Can't really say.

What's the catch?

Or you can't say that either?

Alwayes wanted the answers,
aren't you?

Consider it, an interesting way to break in the new century.

Or simply,
a way to break in that new car.

Before the Bradford interviev.

How do you know about that?

Open it.

Sit down.

Here'e the deal.

If you walk out of here with that package,
you agree to deliver it.

You don't loose it, you don't open it,
and you don't trie to find out what's inside it.

You'll be compensated on the other end.

Go by way of Interstate 60.

Delivery date is October 2th.

So you'll have time to visite some towns,
meet some people.

See what's out there.

Pick up some traveler's tales.

High way expiriences.

Episodes of the Rode.

This is too surreal.

I mean, you, this office,
the 13 floor of a building that has no 13 floor

My alarm clock gonna go off any second.

Rise and shine.

You'll awake Neal.
Could be your awake for the first time in your life.

It's our standard fold.

And I leed you to seal it with the drop of your blood.

Blood?

Of course.
I'm the DEVIL.

Just kidding.

Tradicionally, a man means what he says,
he'll put his blood where his mouth is.

All right.

Oh, one more thing.

There's a killer out there.
So be carefull

Now you tell me?

After I sign?

The journey of life
always includes a possibility od deth.

This killer,
what does he look like?

-Who said it's a man?
It's a woman?

It's not this Robin Fields, is it?

I know... you can't really say.

I didn't misspell the name of that town.

You'll find it.

Just go west, on Interstate 60.

Look, we've been over this.
There is no Intestate 60.

There's US 60.
But there is no interstatep 60.

Look... there's got to be.

Well look at here. Here is 70.

The next major route south is 40.

So if there was an I 60,
it would have to be some where between 70 and 40.

But, ass you can see, it's not there.

It simply doesn't exist.

Where do you find a highway, that doesn't exist?

Well, I decided to look where it be if it did exist.

Ray said, you don't find hidden places,
by sticking to the well travelled routs

So, I skipped well travelled Interstere 55,
and went south on Boob Dylan's highway 61.

And there she was again.

Telling me, I was right.

I was fast becoming a believer in signs.

It's you I'm delivering this package, isn't it?

You're Robin Fields.

Now it makes all sense.

Cool. Very cool.

Very, very cool.

You are the waiter, from my birthday party

O.W. Grant.

Neal Oliver.

It's a strange coincidence,
seeing you here again.

Onely if you believe in coincidence.

I prefer inevitability.

Every event is inevitable.

If it wasn't, it wouldn't happen.

Right.

Oh, I forgor to give you, your birthday present.

Remember your wish?

An answer.

Yeah
That's grate.

Yeah, gets grater.

Go on, go ahead. Try it.

Yes or No questions.

OK, yhm...
Eight ball, is there an Interstate 60.

I told you, it get grater.

Who are you mister?

The O.W stadns for One Wish.

That's what I do.

I grant wishes.

One to a customer.

Your was more interesting,
then most.

Opening.

Sicnefies(?) story(?) insted of greed.

That's what I get most of the time.

gimmi, gimmi, gimmi,

gimmi this, gimmi that...

Usually money, or sex,
or easy living.

How I deliver.
Yeah, that depends on what ???.

Eith Ball, is this guy bullshititng me?

Come on.

Let's find that rode.

Now, one young couple wished to be married.
Live happyly ever after.

So I blue up their car.
At the hurch, on the way to the huneymoon.

Another guy. He wanted grate, perfect sex every day,

with his choice gorgeous wommen. No pregnancys.

So...

Everyday ther is a FedEx delivery...
of a skin magazine...

box of tissues.

There's the Stop sign.
Turn right.

There is a sign post,
up ahead.

Son of a bitch.
I found it.

It was inevitable.

So, I thought all Interstaes were divided highways,
with limited acces.

No, when highway doesn't officially exist.
The rules don't apply.

OK, so how is it, we're on a highway,
that is on any map,

going to a towns, that presumably don't exist?

Well, there are unlisted phone numbers, right?
So, why can't there be unlisted highways and towns?

I don't buy it.
There's got to be a better explenation, than that.

Better explenation.

OK. How about it's a...
parallel dimention.

Or you're in a dream.

Or it has something to do
with your wish.

Or... you're in a coma
from when that bucket hit you.

Or maybe...
jusy maybe...

You're dead.

Well?

Well, what do you want kid?

I just gave you not one explenation,
but six.

All reasonable.

You want an answer,
pick one.

It want change anything.

You, you took a job,
and now you got to do it.

Yeah, but it could change something.

So, what if I'm dead?

What if I'm dead, right now.

There is no reason,
why shouldn't drive on oncoming traffic, right?

OK, go ahead.
Try it.

But that's way you accelerated in way of the big semity,
comming at us,

which should be in about 25 seconds, I figure.

Come to this.
Now, if you are dead...

Then, this is the after life,

and you made a deal with a guy,
sealed in blood,

who knew everything about you,
even what you are going to say, befor you said it.

Now who do you think,
that guy might be?

And...
do you think it is a good idea to piss him of?

Maybe you good a point.

Maby I do.

Oh, I love this highway.

Me?
I can sattle my selfe an artist, too.

I see life, ass..
art appreciation.

You know,
some artist can't stand the sight of their work once it's finisher.

Me, I'm one of my own biggest fans.

And one of my favourites,
will be comming through that door... any moment..

Now.

Yeah, can I take your order?

15 double-cheeseburgers, please.

15 double-cheese to go.

Oh, not to go.
I'll eat them here.

Hold the order.

You're going to eat 15 double-cheeseburgers,
all by your self?

Yeah.

Why, they are real big?
You think 15 to many?

Way to many.

All right. Twelve then.
Even dozen.

Look,
are you drunk or something mr.?

Well I don't know.
Can you get drunk on six beer?

Hay fella.
I've got a hundret says that you can't eat six double-cheese,

as much as twelve.

So, what you're saying is,
they're really big cheeseburgers?

My hundret says you can't eat six double-cheese.

Well, I'm kinda hungry.
maby you're right.

Twelve is to many burgers.
I'll tell you what?

Make it two double-cheese, three orders of fried chicken, one be-all tee,
to hams swiss on rie, chicken fried stake,

Turkey club and, two bolls chilli extra onions.

And one piece of each of those pies.

One piece of each of thiese pies?

Anything else?

Three order onion rings.

That's much more sensible lunch,
than twelve double-cheeseburgers.

Oh, and old pickles.

Free bucks.

If you can finishe all that food,
in one hour.

Whit out getting up from that counter,
and without losing your lunch.

I'm not much of a bet, man.

Two to One odds then...
no, no I'll give you Three to One.

That's 300 to mine...
against 100 to yours.

Well, what the Hell.

It's onely money.

Hal...

You better hold one to this money.

Sure.

Yeah, I'll take some of that.

Eight Ball, is this guy gonna really eat all that food?

Can I yhm...
Can I get on this action?

Ask him.

No I like long shots.

You're crazy your knees.

My money just ass good, right.

Hell about me.

Sir,
you want to drink anything with that?

There's your order.

All right. It's 13:10.
On your mark... Get set...

Wait.

Ketchup, please.

Thanks.

All right... What's the trick?

Trick?

Where is the food?

Can't all be in your stomach.

Actually, I don't know.

The fact is, I always loved eating.
More then anything.

Go into a restaurant,
want to order everything of the menu.

But, I was always frustrated,
by the small capacity of me stomach.

Well, 17 years ago,
I made a wish...

And amazingly enough it came true.

Now I have, what you might call,
a black hole in my belly.

Onely I have to keep eating like this,
six or seven times a day.

Gets expensive.

So, I travel a lot,
and get advantage on guys like you.

That's a good one.

Excuse me, mister.

I've got to know one thing.

Do you still love eating?

No...
now it'a a drag.

Listen kid...

Nobody minds money taken by that guy,
he gave us good show for our money.

But I drow a line over what you did.

What did I do?

I just bet the right horse, that's all.

You run on it. I know a hustle when I see one.

I played a hunch, I swear to God.
I've never seen that guy befor in ymy life

But your friend, there has.

Haven't you fella?

Oh, I wont deny it.

Now,
get beck the money you stole, son.

Look sir, I won a cupple bets.
If that's such a crime why dont we call the police.

I am the police.

Sorry about that.

That's all my money.

Hit the rode, fellas.

OK, so what's your game mr. Grant.
'cause it seams like you know exactly what's gonna happen,

just before it happens,

and it's just like
fucking with me!

Oh, don't take it personal kid.

I fuck with everybody.

That's what I do.

If I tie highly recommended as an unending sorce of amusement.

And as far as knowing what's gonna happen.
Well... on this highway,

the past, the present, the future,

the "What if some maybe's, rodes not taken",

could all converge, get jumble up.

I just happen to be tuned into it.
That's all.

So what are you?
Like an Angel or God, or something?

Just, picking up certalin people to give him a wish?

No... no,
just a guy who likes to mess with peoples heds.

I'm a Joker...
in life's deck.

But, why do it?

I enjoy it.

You should always find something to do,
that you enjoy.

Although I will admit I have been concidering a career change.

Job in a convenience store...

Or maybe becoming...

a male prostitute.

You're gey?

You're fucking with me, aren't you?
Yeah.

Fact is I'm a virgin.

I always will be.

My penis...
was cut off i a very wird accident,

when I was nine.

Yeah, right.

You want to see it?

Yeah... show me.

Holy shit.

Oh, God...

Oh, let me tell you, the world is very different pace,
when you're not constantly thinking about sex.

or responding sexually to everything...

Yeah.

That is a ruby.

Wait, how would you know?

How would you know,
what it's like to not have something, you never had?

Now you're thinking.

You'd be suprised,
how many people take that statement on faith.

Sounds right,
so they just except it.

As I say.

Messing with peoples heads,
can be a lot of fun.

You should try it.

Some nice scenery coming up ahead.

Hello Lyn...
you're going my way?

If you're going west.

Then, that's my way.

Hey, why don't you hop in the back,
bacause huggy here is gonna wanna take a good luck at me,

and if I'm in the front,
he'll have a better view.

And if you're in the back...
so will you.

I'm Laura.

Neal.

Oh, and that's Mr. Grant.

So, where you going Lauro?

Me?

Oh, I'm going to a...

find a perfect fuck.

Wow, that's an interesting destination.

Yeah, ever been ther?

Can't say that I have.
Me either.

But so far chips have been pretty exciting.

Onely, how will you know,
when you'v gotten there?

That is the problem.
It's actually become my obsession,

but you don't need to here about it.

Sure, sure I do.

The first time, wasn't that grate.

I'm thinking:
This is it?

This is what all these songs are written about?
I mean, talk about ???.

Second time was a little bit better.

Third time, now that was a hot time.

Forth time, not as good as the third time.

But once I've done it enough to have all this expiriences to compare,
just drove me nuts.

I mean,
what if the best one was right around the corner?

You know, how much better,
would the perfect one be?

So this became my quest.

No, there is times,
when wish I've gone to the convent.

But my obsession,
becomes your opportunities.

You little stun muffin.
You want to take adventage of a girl that can't say no?

Any guy turned you down before?

No, unless he was gey.

OK...
What number would I be?

2461.

But I have got a very,
very good hearing about you,

and there's something very, very special.

I think I'm gonna pass, Laura.
What do you mean, you pass?

Guyes don't pass.

Oh, I'm clean, there is no disease,
if that's what you're worried about.

I've got condoms...
all best kinds.

Come on Neal...
stick it to me.

I'm not doing it. Period.

So, you just.
You are not man enough?

You meet a real woman
and you turn in to a wuss?

Think you want measure up, hm?

Well, you'll never know,
will you?

Because if I don't do it...

I want be number 2000 and whatever.

I'll be number One.

That one guy.
Guy you will remember for the rest of your life.

You stay up at night,
thinking about me, wondering,

Was he the One?

The answer is yes.
I am the perfect fuck.

The one you never had...

Perfect on every way...

Look, stop it, stop it...

This is Zen thing, it's amazing...
I've never been perfect in anything befor.

Well, you can fuck me.

My mind fuck, and it was terrible.

It was good for me.

What about you Mr.?

I'll bet,
you're a real man.

You're man enough to be in my book?

Oh, Hell yes.
Put me down in there.

But I sometimes got little troubles...
getting excited.

Let me take care of that baby.

Now, that's a museum you'd really appreciate.

What is it? A bunch of bogass paintings

Stop in Renburg.
Have a look.

You'll find it very...
thought provoking.

450 mile to  Danver.

Quarter tank of gas, and no money.

Well, by Columbus had sailed,
he didn't know if it had any wind.

Stop!

Help. Stop!

Jesus lady...

Help my, please, my son...
took my car and run of, I think he is in Banton.

Will you take me there?
I've got to find him.

Look I' sorry,
but I'm not going that way.

I'll pay you... 53 dolars...
It's all I have just take me to Banton.

Help my find my son, please.

You need money.
She shows up.

Coincidence?

All right, hop in. I'll take you.
Thank you

Well, I'll hop out.

You're geting in tune with the highway.

Say,

that's important.

Good luck Neal.

Hey, wait a minute. Am I gonna see you again?

Always wanting an answer.

Well, maybe you'll find it in Banton.

I'll pay you the rest,
when we'll find Filip.

Oh, I'm Susan Ross.

Neal Oliver.

So, how old is Filip, Susan?
16.

He's my baby.

He's all I have.

He's run away before,
but he's always come back.

God I am so scared...

What if I never find him?

Well, did you call the Police?
They say I should look in Banton

It's not like I've been a bad mother.

it's just...
so hard when you're all alone.

We're gonna find him Susan.

We'll find him.

<i>It is illegal to sell,</i>

{Y:I}Euphoria is legal in Banton,
and is distributed within the Banton city limits.

<i>- However it is illegal...</i>
What town is this?

Maybe we should talk to the Police?

{Y:I}Come on.

16-year-old,
in town with legal drugs, and a rage.

Sorry,
but I don't think he'll be at the library.

{Y:I}The next bus to the rave is leaving in five minutes.
The next bus to the rave is leaving in five minutes.

First timers?

Are you aware,
that Euphoria is being distributed inside,

that it is dangerous, and addictive substance,
and it is strongly advised not to part take of it?

Well, how can we not be?

Go on.

You'll need this.

No, thanks.

Don't be stupid.

This is the answer.

This is to everything.

And you really need it.

Susan!

He's over here.

Filip.

Oh, thank God,
we've found you.

Please, let's go home.

Chill ma, I am home.

See this? This is the place.
The happiest place on earth.

You can't stay here.
You have to come home.

Fuck off.

Who's this?

New stud boyfriend?

Sure can digg him.

You've got school.
Fuck school.

I've got Euphoria.

Here, try some mom, the best.

Filip.
You can't stay here.

Yo, I'm in legal age here.

I can do anything I want.
I want... Euphoria.

You stole my car.

It's in the yard. Take it.

I don't want it.
Eat it.

No, you take me there.

Go away. Leave me alone

Hey, what's a matter with you?

What's going on her?
Hey now brake it out.

Filip come home.

That's it.
Filip! Filip! Please come home.

The fact is ma'am, here your son's legal age.

He wants to stay...
He can't be forced to leave.

And...

He wants to stay.

No, thay all do.
Thay're addicts.

But he's just a boy.
He didn't know what he was doing.

Oh, no no.

He knew.

They all knew,
that's why there are all those wornings posted all over town.

Yeah, but if this drug is so addictive,
why is it legal?

Son...

This town had siriuse drug problem.

And all the problems that go along with it.

We tried everything.

Punishment for dealing, punishment for using.
More inforcement,

tougher inforcement, jail,
hell, public humiliation.

But, it all came down to one thind.

Some folks...
just wanna get high.

So...

We came up with a radical solution...

Euphoria.

Syntatic drug, potent legal,
and totally addictive,

and we warn everyone, not to use it.

But like I said,
some folks just wanna get high.

One hit of this, and you are hooked.

And we own them.

Camp controls the suplies
so of course we can set the prize, and we made it very affordable.

Live in our camps, eat our food, and still couple off jobs,

pick up spome trash, mow tha lawn,
force some toilets, and you get your Euphoria.

And at night, man... party till you drop.

Patrol so intense,
that everybody payes the price.

It's an incredible achievemet, really.

Drug so powerfull, that it supresses the sex drive.

You know, how many rapes we had here last year?

None.

Are you saying Filip
is going to cleanning toiletes for the rest of his life?

With no sex deive?

He'll never marry.

I'll never have grandhildren?

It's ironick, isn't it?

Americans fought a war for freedom...

another one to end slavery.

What a Salomon choose to do with thair freedom?

Become slaves.

But they're humen beings.
They have rights.

They didn't know what thay be given up.

Thay made a choice.

But look at them.

They seam miserable to you.

They live a simple, happy life.

No decisions... no responsibilities...

No problems...

They found their answer.

You so shure,
that your life is better than thairs?

It's like thay're animals.

Oh yeah, we're all animals.

Just that, some of us have different priorites.
That's all.

Whatever your priorities are,
Banton is a really nice place to live.

No, it's a nightmare.
Prease, I want my son back.

I'll do anything.

All right than.
It comes down to three choices.

One.
You move here to the Euphoria free zone,

and that way,
you at least have the chance to see him.

Hell, some parents
end up having their children work for them.

Kind of reverse pay back.

Two. You go home.

Try to find something else
to make your life worth a while.

Or three...

Join the party.

What should I do?

You're smart... tell me what to do.

I don't know.

I guess, if it was me...

I'd want to see my boy.

But he doesn't want to see me.

Oh, my God...

It's wonredful...

I... feel so... beautiful...

I never knew, I can be so...

happy.

Well, how about you son?
