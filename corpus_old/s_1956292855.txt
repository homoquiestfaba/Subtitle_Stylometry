<i>"The Ghoul Next Door!"</i>

Whoa, what are you
drawing, Vee?

It's a bunch of bats

flying through
a pitchâ€black forest
at midnight!

I used
my Transylvania chalk set.

Remember, Bridget.

It's just a drawing.

It's just aâ€â€

Eek! Bats!

Ah, sorry!

Transylvanian chalk
is a little more magical

than the stuff
humans draw with!

That's okay. I should be
used to it by now.

But I'm not.

Vee! Poppy!
Bridget! Look!

We must be getting
new neighbors.

I hope there are
some kids our age!

Hmmm.

Oh, hey there, I'm Edgar!

Greetings! I. Am. Drake.

Huh?

Sorry.

I kinda do weird voices
when I'm nervous.

Heh. How's it going?

Hi! I'm Vampirina.

â€This is Bridget,
Poppy, andâ€â€
â€

Edgar Peepleson!

World famous weekly web show
host with almost 15 viewers!

Hmm. You sure
like bats, huh?

Yeah, they're my favorite!

I really like
dark and spooky stuff.

Awesome! I do, too!

Say... where are you
moving from?

Oh! I'm from
somewhere faaaar away.

Sorry. Did it again!

Heh.
Still a little nervous.

Don't worry about it.

Even I go a little "batty"
when I'm nervous.

Are you gonna be
starting at school soon?

Tomorrow, actually.

I know how it feels
to be the new kid.

It can be a little scary,
and not in the good way.

But we'll show you around.

Yeah. Like
where the cafeteria is

and which water fountain
won't spray you in the face.

That's an important one.

Drake!
Will you grab a moving box

and bring it inside?

Coming, Mom! Well...

I'll...
See. You. Tomorrow.

Bye!

Wow, he's pretty fast.

He could give you
a run for your money, Vee.

Totally!

He seems
really nice, too!

Wait a minute!

He didn't seem...
suspicious to you?

Suspicious?
What do you mean?

The bat shirt.
The bat belt buckle.

Saying he's from "far away."

Let me see.

Aha! Here it is.

I knew all that
sounded familiar.

Drake's a vampire!

Vampires? Here?

I don't know about that.

Yeah. There's, uh,
no such thing as vampires!

And even if there were,
could you imagine one
living here?

In Pennsylvania?

Vampires are real!
And Drake is one of them!

I'll prove it!

Hi, loyal viewers

and welcome
to "Weekly Weirdness:

<i>Vampire Edition."</i>
<i>Here we seeâ€â€</i>

<i>Edgar, what are you doing?</i>

I'm trying to get
some proof on camera
that Drake's a vampire.

Uh, maybe you
should do something else

for your web show,
like, uh...

Mr. Gore's pet hamster!

He's not spooky,
but he's pretty cute!

I don't think so, Vee.

My guidebook says vampires
are always walking among us,

and I'm determined
to get one on camera.

You just have to look
for the signs.

â€Vampires have fangs.
â€

They usually sleep
during the day

and stay awake at night,

can't stand garlic,

and they can turn
into a bat!

Don't worry.
It's not like Edgar's

actually
gonna find anything.

You just need to let him
do his thing.

Once he realizes
Drake is a human,
he'll let it go.

â€
â€Yeah, I guess you're right.

â€ Drake!
â€Oh! Hey, there.

Did you have
a good first day?

No one, um,
bothered you, did they?

Nothing besides
that spraying drinking fountain

Bridget was talking about.

â€Told ya!
â€Yeah.

Farewell until tomorrow!

Sounds like Edgar gave up
on looking for vampires!

You were right, Poppy!

Vee! I proved it!

Look at this!

<i>Vampire Edition."</i>

<i>I, Edgar Peepleson,</i>

<i>have made contact</i>
<i>with a real, live vampire.</i>

<i>Today the proof</i>
<i>began to pile up.</i>

<i>First, vampires like dark</i>
<i>and spooky stuff! Check!</i>

<i>Second,</i>
<i>they stay awake at night</i>

<i>and sleep</i>
<i>during the day. Check.</i>

<i>And vampires avoid garlic.</i>
<i>Check!</i>

<i>And there you have it!</i>

<i>This is Edgar Peepleson</i>
<i>saying,</i>

<i>"You stay weird, Pennsylvania!"</i>

I don't really think
that proves anything.

Butâ€â€
but the black paint.

And sleeping in class?

And what kind of monster
doesn't like garlic bread!?

Vampires!

Maybe Drake just doesn't
like garlic bread.

It could happen.

Yeah. Maybe...

I'll just have to keep looking.

And that's my brother,
everybody.

You okay, Vee?

Well, I guess I'm just thinking
that Edgar might be right.

â€Huh?!
â€Really?!

It's a long shot,

but Drake could be
a vampire.

Let's go ask my parents
just to make sure.

Another vampire?
In Pennsylvania?

â€At least Edgar thinks so.
â€Is it possible?

We haven't heard
anything from the spooks
or ghouls back home.

But Drake's family could be
one of those vampire families

from northern Transylvania.

They tend
to keep to themselves.

But he doesn't really look
like a vampire.

We vampires come
in all shapes and sizes.

You should never judge
a ghoul by its cover.

Yeah! I mean,
look at Gregoria!

She looks pretty grumpy,

but she's actually
fangtastically lovable!

Of course I am!

So what do I do, Papa?

I can't talk to Drake
about vampire stuff

unless I know
for sure he is one!

Ah! We'll just have
to find out.

<i>â™ª If I had</i>
<i>to take a guess â™ª</i>

Wow. Maybe Drake
really is a vampire!

If it's true, we'll have
to give him and his family

a proper welcome
to the neighborhood.

We'll make him one
of our famous Hauntley
gift batâ€skets.

Terrifying idea,
my spook!

I'll go get
some cobwebs to weave!

â€
â€ Yeah! Cool!

Edgar! And Drake?!

Heading to... my house!

If Drake
really is a Vampireâ€â€

Then Edgar could put him
on "Weekly Weirdness"
for everyone to see!

We better head
over there.

â€Whoa!
â€Oh!

Right away.

At least we know
Vee is definitely a vampire.

Thanks
for inviting me over.

You have that weirdness
web show, right?

I'm into
weird stuff, too!

Like aliens and monsters
and stuff!

Yeah, my web show
is pretty...

Boo!

Um... aah?

â€
â€ Edgar, Drake, hey!

Hope it's cool,
I invited the girls over.

Drake, is it okay if we talk
to Edgar for a minute?

Edgar what
are you doing now?!

I'm gonna get the final piece
of proof I need!

My guidebook says
if a vampire is startled,

they'll turn into a bat.

So all I need to do
is get Drake turning
into a bat on camera.

But I think what he could
really use right now
is a friend.

That's what helped me
when I was the new kid.

â€Uhâ€huh...
â€

Hey, Drake, uh,

you want to head
to the kitchen for a snack?

Sure!

How about some apple slices?

Sounds applicious!

Great, then here you go!

â€Aha!
â€Aah!

Aah!

Drake, why don't you go
check out Edgar's room?

He's got a bunch
of cool toys in there.

What is it?

Um, nothing!
You go ahead.

Uh, we'll
be in there in a minute.

Yes. Now's my chance.

C'mon, Drake!

â€
â€Are you okay, Vee?

I am now.

But that camera flash gave me
a bad case of the battys.

If Edgar takes
a picture of Drake,

and he is a vampire,

he'll definitely transform!

You like UFO's, too?

My mom says aliens
aren't real,

but I totally
believe in them.

Take me to your leaderrrr.

What's not
to love about UFOs?

â€Turn brightness
all the way up...
â€

and all set.

Hey, uh, over here!

Nooo!

Cheese?

Huh? Drake you're...

Human?!

Well, yeah, of course I am!

Wait, what did you
think I was?

A vampire!

Well, that would be
pretty cool,

but, nope!
Just a boring human.

But your bat shirt
and belt buckle,

and you don't
eat garlic bread!

Would you want garlic breath

on your first day
at a new school?

P.U.!

Uh... I guess not.

And I like a lot of stuff
that's different,

so it takes kids
a little while
to figure me out.

It can be hard
when you're different, y'know?

More than you know, Drake!

Vee seemed pretty different
when she first moved
to Pennsylvania.

But we realized
that her being
different is sooo cool!

Just like you!

So you've got at least
three friends at school now.

Three friends?
Don't you mean four?

You said
you like UFO's, right?

Yeah! I mean,
not as much as Bigfoot.

You... like... Bigfoot?!

We gotta get working
on the next "Weekly Weirdness!"

Whadaya say... coâ€host?

Sounds. Good. To. Me.

And sorry I thought
you were a vampire.

It's cool!

I guess that's why you should
never judge a ghoul,

or human, by their cover!

Girls, how'd everything go
with our new neighbors?

Should we bring over
the batâ€sket?

It's almost done.

As long as Demi doesn't keep
eating the ickyâ€sticky caramels.

We'll take your word
for it, you goofy ghost.

It turns out that Drake
is human after all.

Well, I'll be
a mummy's uncle.

I guess even humans
can fool monsters!

And I guess that means we get
to keep the gift batâ€sket!

I'm sorry you didn't get
a new vampire friend, batkins.

That's okay! I have
the world's best human friends.

And now Drake does, too!

<i>"The Scare B and Vee!"</i>

56, 57, 58, 59...

Hmm.

â€60!
â€Ah, thank you, Demi.

We're all set
for the Scare Fair!

Do you think you'll sell
a lot of magic quilts
this year, Papa?

I have a feeling
they'll fly off the shelves!

I got this!

Especially my super
spooktacular soaring quilt.

Papa, can I see
just one quilt
do its magic?

Well, they're all packed up.

Pleeeease?

How can you say no
to those fangs?

All right. Just one.

â€ Hey, now!
â€ Whoa!

There it goes!

Whoa!

â€Aah!
â€Aah!

How do you get it
to stop?

Normally, you have
to tuck the quilt

into bed to calm it down.

But in this case, my super speed
will do the trick.

â€Ohhâ€laâ€la!
â€Wowza!

Aw, I wish
I could go with you.

Well, then who would
take care of the guests?

Guests? I didn't know
we had guests coming
to the Scare B&B.

Well, Vee, Papa and I both
think you are becoming

such a responsible
little vampire,

we thought we could trust you
to host our next guests.

Wow! I'm gonna be in charge
of the Scare B&B all by myself?

Demi, Gregoria, and Chef Remy
will be here to help, of course.

â€ Yeah!
â€ Right!

And the guests
are zombies.

They mostly just drool,
groan, and zombieâ€walk.

And then drool some more.

Wow! My very first time

hosting guests
without Mama and Papa!

I know
you'll make us proud!

Goodbye, batkins.
See you tomorrow!

Goodbye, baticakes!

Bye, Mama. Bye, Papa.

Have a fangtastic time
at the Scare Fair!

Yes! I can't believe
I'm the host of the Scare B&B!

Everything has to be
perfect for the zombies!

I want to make the B&B
extra spookyâ€special for them!

Oh, they
won't need much, Vee.

Really you just have
to watch out for the drool.

Our main job will be
staying out of their way!

But this is my first time
in charge,

and Mama and Papa
are trusting me.

I don't want to let them down.

I want to make
the B&B as spooky as can be.

<i>â€</i>
<i>â€</i>

<i>â€</i>
â€

â€
â€The zombies are here!

Welcome, zombâ€â€

Huh?

Okay, Those look

like the most
upbeat zombies
I've ever seen!

That's
because they're not zombies!

Humans!

Well, hello there!

Um, hi,
Mr. and Mrs...

uh...

ZombiÃ©s.

Most people say "Zombies."
It's a common mistake.

So you're not real zombies?

â€Zoâ€â€
â€

Oh, no! Oh, weâ€â€

We might be
a little tired,

but I don't think
we look that bad!

â€
â€Oh, my.

Uh heh.

So, may we come in?

Oh! Uh, sure!
Of course you can come in.

Because you're our guests,
and I'm your hostess
with the ghostest.

I mean... mostest.

Um, I'm Vampirina,
by the way.

Oh, Vampirina.
What an usualâ€â€ Oh!

Ew! Yech!

Sorry about that!

â€
â€Uhâ€â€

what was that?

I... didn't
hear anything.

Okay, I heard that.

Will you excuse me
for just a second?

I just remembered I left
the... refrigerator...
door... open.

Be right back.

This is terrible!

Huh! You're telling me!

Now I can't serve
ze ice scream!

What I mean is,
the guests are human,
so they can't see you.

Which means you can't help!

Now, don't worry, Vee.

Speak for yourself!
I'd worry!

How's Vee supposed to host
those humans all by herself?

She won't have to.

This ghostess with the mostest
has an idea!

Vee, even though we can't
be out there with you,

we'll be nearby
the whole time.

<i>Oui!</i> We'll help you
every step of the way.

Sounds like a plan to me!

Uh, Vampirina!

I'd better get back!

Huh?

I'm back!

Vampirina,
I gotta ask you.

Are there any grownâ€ups
here, uh, at all?

Um, well,
of course there are.

One adult here!

In fact, I've been
an adult for 400 years!

Pardon me?

Cheese and crackers?

â€ Oh, my!
â€Oopsy daisy.

Uh, ha! Did I mention
he's a chef and a magician?

I'm gonna need
a little more help
than this!

Thanks for coming.

Are you kidding?

Helping you host
at the Scare B&B?

It's a dream come true!

â€
â€

So, what do we do first?

How about you show
the guests to their room?

Got it!

Hello! May I kindly
show you to your room?

Why, allow me!

Whew! Okay, Poppy and Bridget
are taking care of the guests.

And what are we
supposed to do?

Stand around
like a pile of rocks?

Don't be silly,
Gregoria.

You're supposed
to be standing around
like a pile of rocks.

There's nothing
rockâ€like about me.

What we need to do is
unâ€spook the rest of the house

before the guests
discover anything else!

Then let's do this!

<i>â€</i>
â€

The guests are
in their room.

And the house
is deâ€spookified!

Now all I have
to do is make sure
I'm the perfect host!

Uh, for humans.

â€Excuse me, Vampirina?
â€

Mrs. ZombiÃ©s!
How may we haunt you.

I mean, help you?

I can never read the small print
on these bottles

if I don't have my glasses.

Uh, could you tell me
which one is the bubble bath?

It's this one.
Here, I'll open it for you.

Thank you, dear.

Uhâ€oh. Poppy. Wait!

â€It's not regular
bubble bath!
â€Huh?!

It's...

â€Aaah!
â€Oh! Oh, my!

Bubble bath potion!

Oh, boy.
That is a lot of bubbles!

Get me down from here!

â€We're trying!
â€Hang on!

Uh, we don't like
to skimp on bubbles!

I got this!

Aah!
Bad bubbles! Bad!

â€Demi!
â€That did not
work as planned!

Help! Heeeellllpp!

I gotcha buddy!

â€Aah!
â€Unh!

Oh!

Hee hee. Thank you.

Bubble trouble
stop on the double!

Oh! What on earth
was that?!

I'm so sorry,
Mrs. ZombiÃ©s!

It must have been a broken pipe
from under the floor.

You know how old and creaky
they can get.

Heh.

Come on, Mrs. ZombiÃ©s.

We'll walk you
back to your room.

And get you a towel...
or ten.

You okay, Vee?

Yeah. But being a host
at the Scare B&B

is harder than I thought.

And a lot soapier!

You sure you don't
want us to stay?

Now that the ZombiÃ©s
are going to bed,

I think we'll be okay.

â€
â€Good!

I mean, it was fun
helping, but...

It wasn't easy.

At least we don't
have to worry

about any other
spooky stuff happening.

Mmm. It's smoothâ€screaming
from here on out.

â€ Okay, bye!
â€Bye, Vee!

<i>â€Eeek!</i>
â€It's an eekâ€mail
from Mama!

<i>Hello, Vee!</i>

<i>We're having a fangtastic time</i>
<i>at the Scare Fair.</i>

<i>We are!</i>

<i>I hope everything</i>
<i>is going well at the B&B.</i>

<i>We miss you,</i>
<i>and we'll see you soon!</i>

<i>Oh! One more thing.</i>

<i>Silly us, we forgot one</i>
<i>of our magic quilts at home.</i>

<i>It's in the guest room</i>
<i>if you want to use it.</i>

<i>Byeâ€bye, batkins!</i>

â€Magic quilt?!
â€Guest room?!

â€Oh, dear!
â€We've got trouble!

We need to get that magic quilt
out of the ZombiÃ©s' room

before they find it!
But how?

I have an idea!

Oh, uh, hello, Chef.

<i>Bonsoir!</i> Good evening!

May I invite you to have
a midnight snack in ze kitchen?

But it's, uhâ€â€
It's not midnight.

It's always midnight...
somewhere!

Well, we do enjoy snacks.

Find the quilt!

Oh! Magic quilt,
magic quilt, magic quilt!

Demi, wait!
Don't unfold it!

Yah!

Too late.

Oh, no! Get it!

Huh! Whoaaa!

Uh!

Oh! Missed it!

Lemme try!

Uyah! Aah!

Ha! Solid as a rock!

Did you guys see that?
I caught it!

And I lost it.

Oh, I hope
you liked ze...

This is one batty blanket!

First course!

Let me serve you
ze next one!

Unh! We need to tuck it
into the bed!

Bedtime,
little blankie!

Oh, it's bedtime!

â€Got it.
â€ Got what?

Oh. Uh, your bed.

We made it nice
and comfy for you.

Ah! How lovely!

Good night,
Mr. and Mrs. ZombiÃ©s.

Good night, magic quilt.

Pardon me?

Oh, nothing.

Just something we say
as hosts at the Scare B&B!

Uh, good morning,
Mr. and Mrs. ZombiÃ©s!

How did you sleep?

We slept, uh...

â€wonderfully!
â€Phew!

â€Whew!
â€Yes!

It was that quilt!

It felt like it was
hugging us all night long.

It was rather...
magical!

You can say that again.

And being
a host at the Scare B&B

was pretty magical, too.

Thanks to
the very best helpers around.

â€Aww!
â€Ohh!
