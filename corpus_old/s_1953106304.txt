We Need To Talk About Kevin

<i>When you go to the ball...</i>

<i>you have to learn how to dance
like a princess, right?</i>

<i>1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...</i>

<i>- 1, 2, 3...
Yeah!</i>

<i>What are you gonna wear today?</i>

<i>- I'm gonna wear...
You're gonna wear...</i>

<i>- I'm gonna wear...
A bucket on your head.</i>

<i>- No!
1, 2, 3... No?</i>

<i>- And a barrel round your bottom.
No!</i>

<i>- And cloth bags for shoes?
Nooo!</i>

<i>1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...</i>

<i>1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...</i>

Good morning.

Hey buddy!

Want something to eat?

No. I'm not hungry.

Yeah, that's fine.

Yeah.

<i>Franklin?</i>

<i>Hey. It's me. I just
wanted to leave a message.</i>

<i>Do you think we could make
some time to talk later</i>

<i>just the two of us, without the kids?</i>

<i>I really wanna work this thing out.</i>

<i>Okay?
I miss you.</i>

Eva Khatchadourian!

It's a lot.

Look, Eva.

I don't really care who you are

or what you've done so long as
you can type and you can file.

You can have this job.

Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you.

I wont let you down.
I promise you. Thank you.

Thank you so much.
Sure.

See you Monday.

Great. Thank you.

Looks like someone is having
a nice day?

Enjoying yourself?

I'm sorry?

I hope you rot in hell, you
fucking bitch!

Jesus. What the hell was that?
Are you ok?

No, no, no, it's nothing.
Its really... its nothing.

Let me call 911.
No, no, it was my fault.

But she just totally...
No, no, I'm fine.

<i>Eva, when are you coming home?</i>

<i>I miss you.</i>

<i>I love you.</i>

<i>Promise me you'll never
go away again.</i>

<i>I will never, never,
never go away again.</i>

<i>Promise me. Promise me</i>

<i>you'll never go away again.</i>

Is it safe?

No, it's not safe.

Sure?

Are you sure about this?

<i>This really happened?</i>

<i>I can see, I can feel it...</i>

<i>We did it.</i>

I'm gonna need all these processed
today, Eva.

Uh, but today my afternoon off.

You remember? I told you.

Ah shit, that's right.

Look, give these to Massughi.
Sure.

Hey, Eva.
Hey, Al.

No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!

Get off me!
Keep walking.

Hey lady! Lady! Lady! Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!

Get off of me!

Eva, you can stop resisting.

Stop resisting, Eva.

Eva!

Rise and shine.

It's late, Eva.

The day is almost over.

Hiii! - Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.

I just put him down, Franklin.

Hi.

There he is. You wanna play?

You wanna play?

It's alright.

Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.

Do you think I'm exaggerating?

You just have to rock him a
little bit.

You just have to rock him a
little bit.

There's my little dude!

Jesus! All 12?

I'll take them as they are.
But they are totally broken...

I'll take them as they are!

<i>You're gonna be a good looking boy.</i>

<i>All the girls are gonna love you.</i>

I know it. Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.

Can you say "mommy"?

"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?

Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".

"Ball"?

No?
Okay.

I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're
gonna roll it back to me, okay?

Okay.

Roll it back to mommy.

Roll it back. Roll.
Roll it back.

Okay, okay.

Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.

Roll it back.
Roll it back.

When he was a baby,
he never stopped screaming.

I thought maybe it had damaged
his hearing.

No, his hearing is fine.

But shouldn't he be talking by now?

I read somewhere that non-verbalizing
was the...

an early sign of autism.

He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.

I wouldn't worry about it too much.

He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?

But there is nothing wrong with him.

Thank you.

Okay.

Roll it back to mommy.

Okay. Gonna roll it back again.

That was really good, Kev.

Okay. Here we go.
Okay?

Okay?

<i>"E" is for elephant,
large as a house,</i>

<i>he's big as can be,
not small like a mouse.</i>

Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?

"Elephant".

Kevin!

Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?

No!

"Mommy"?
No!

Just say "mommy".
No.

Trick or treat?

Trick or treat?
Hey lady. We know you're in there.

<i>I don't like that!</i>

<i>I don't like that!</i>

<i>I don't like that!</i>

Mommy was happy before little Kevin
came along. Do you know that?

And now mommy wakes up every morning...

and wishes she was in France!

That elevator is a death trap.

He needs a yard,
somewhere he can toss a ball,

fill a pool.

But I love New York.

Come on!

You sound like a bumper sticker.

It's a matter of priorities, Eva.

He's only gonna be a kid once.

You can house hunt all you want.

I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.

Kevin, stop that. That's enough.

Let mommy and daddy talk.

Kevin, quit that!

<i>You have your family room here.</i>

<i>Master bedroom is back there
and two huge walk-in closets.</i>

<i>The bathroom is amazing.</i>

Here we are, guys.

Our very own castle.

I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?

Hey! Hey!
Wait up! Mrs. K!

Hey! It's me!

Soweto.

Hi there.

I just wanted to see how you were.

I'm fine. Thanks.

You look well.

Yeah. The doctors are saying there's
a chance I might walk again.

That's great.

Well, you take care, Mrs. K.

You, too.

Come on, come on!

Die! Die!

No! No! No!

Die!
How do you jump?

Die!

Go! Go! Go! Go!

Die!

Hey Kev? Are you out there?

Kevin?

Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.

You can do that too.

So you want a connector right there.

You see? And click on that link
and it should open right up.

And If it doesn't...
we'll try it again.

So you left click. Wanna give it a try?
Sure.

No, no.
I'm sorry.

Right click, right there.
Yeah.

See that? It comes up.

Right. Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.

Thank you for your help.

I pooped.

Hey buddy. What?

You pooped?

Oh okay. Here let me help you.

Okay.

Go to your room. I'll be right there.

Let's not wake up mommy.

Go on! Go on, buddy.

These squiggly squares
of paper, they are dumb.

Everybody needs a room of their own.

You have your room.
This is the mama's room.

I can help you make your room special,
if you'd like.

What do you mean, "special"?

Well, so it looks like your personality.

What personality?

I think you know what I mean.

They're dumb.

No, no, no. I mean it's good.

You don't need me to do that?

And... and the guys...

Okay.

Well, I mean, if you have it in hand...

I could.

Really?

Well, that all sounds great.

Okay, John.

Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

Kevin?

Kevin?

What else do you have to say?

Go wash your face!

He said, he's really sorry.

And that he was only trying to help
make it special.

Do you remember how you got that?

It's the most honest thing
you ever did.

Do you know how they potty train cats?

They stick their noses in their own shit.

They don't like it.

So they use the box.

Okay. Let's work on our counting.

What comes after 3?
9.

What comes after 7?
71.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30,

31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

41, 42, 43, 44, 45,
46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

Now, can we quit?

There.

You can add that together
if you think you're so smart.

You did not...

You did not...

Are you enjoying yourself?

I can see the doctor by myself.

I have to tell you something, Eva.

It's a brave boy you've got there.

Thank you.
Anytime.

What mamma did
was very, very wrong.

And she's so, so sorry.

Hey, Kev? Kev, hold on a sec!

Kev?

Kevin?

Hey Kev.
What happened?

I broke my arm.

How did you brake your arm?

I had poopy pants.

Mommy went to get wipes.

I fell off the changing table
onto my dump trucks.

Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.

It's all my fault.

No, no, don't be silly.

You can't watch him
every second of the day.

Franklin...

Unbelievable.

How did you get him
to do that?

Well, whatever it was it worked.

Not yet.

Okay.

I love you, kiddo.

I don't like that.
Turn it off.

Honey. Do you mind if we stop
over at the store?

I wanna go home.

It's just that I need to pick up...

Home it is.

Hey, guys!

Hey, Dad! How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?

Eva, he's just a boy.

He's a sweet little boy.

That's what boys do.

Mom is fat!

When did you...
When were you gonna tell me?

Soon. Now.

How am I part of the decision now?

What am I supposed to say now?

So, the daddy bear plants his seed
in the mommy bear

and it grows into an egg.

Is this about fucking?

Do you know what that means?

The boy puts his pee pee
in the girl's doo doo.

Well...

Haven't you ever wished
you had somebody else around to play with?

No.

You might like it.

What if I don't like it?

Then you get used to it.

Just because you're used to
something...

doesn't mean you like it.

You're used to me.

Yes, well...

In a few months we're all gonna
get used to somebody new.

Beautiful.

Hey, Kev. Come over and meet your
little sister.

This is your brother. It's Kevin.

It's your big brother.

Yes, yeah.

It's Kevin.
Yes, yes...

Kevin! Don't do that.

No, Kevin. That's not nice.

It's OK.

We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.

<i>Christ! To Ecuador? For 2 months?
Why can't you send someone else?</i>

<i>I really wanna work this deal.</i>

<i>First he cries too much,
then he's too quiet.</i>

<i>Then he makes up his own little language,
and it's annoying.</i>

<i>He has trouble toilet-training.
A lot of kids do.</i>

<i>And you see this as some kind
of personal vendetta?</i>

<i>This is not good for him.</i>

<i>Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!</i>

<i>Pick up the god damn phone.</i>

...13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19...

...20, 21, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27...

Please! Please! Let me have
a drink. I'm begging you! Pleeeease!

Kevin?

Kevin!

Honey?

Are you ok?

I'm sorry, mom.

Not to worry, sweetheart.

You couldn't help it.

"By my soul," cried Gilbert.

"Art thou the devil in blue,
to shoot in that wise?"

"Nay," quoth Robin, laughing,
"not quite so ill as that, I trust."

"And he took up another shaft... "
Are you okay, honey?

"And he took up another shaft
and fitted it to the string."

"Again he shot..."

"and again he smote the arrow
close beside the center;"

"a third time he loosed his bowstring"

"and dropped his arrow
just betwixt the other two"

"and into the very center,"

"so that the feathers of all three
were ruffled together,"

"seeming from a distance
to be one thick shaft."

"And now a low murmur ran
all among that great crowd..."

Hey champ. How are you doing?

Feeling better?

Go away. I'm tired.

Oh. Okay.

Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?

Don't stop reading, mom.

"Two hundred and eighty score
shafts were shot in all,"

"and so deftly were they sped that
when the shooting was done"

"each target looked like
the back of a hedgehog"

"when the farm dog snuffs at it."

Good afternoon, ma'am.

I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.

Well, it is actually.

Well, we just have a couple
of quick questions for you.

What's this about?

Do you know where you are
spending the afterlife?

Oh, yes, I do as a matter of fact.

I'm going straight to hell.

Eternal damnation, the whole bit.

Thank you for asking.
Okay?

Hey, honey. Let me help you with that.

I can dress myself.
Can you leave?

Sure.

I'm glad you're feeling better.

Do you want some more of that
chowder for lunch?

Whatever.

Or a grilled cheese sandwich?
I don't give a rat's ass.

Thank you, dad, this is so cool!

You're welcome, buddy.

Right. Here we go.
In the middle.

Ooooh. Almost. Here.

Take that one.
Try again.

Use your finger...

Keep your eyes in the middle.

Good shot, Kev.

You're a natural.

Perfect.

Thanks, dad.

<i>Right.</i>

<i>It's like this.</i>

<i>You wake up.</i>

<i>Then you watch TV.</i>

<i>You get in the car, then you
listen to the radio.</i>

<i>Then you go to you little job
or your little school</i>

<i>but we're not gonna hear about
that on the 6 o'clock news.</i>

<i>Why?</i>

<i>Because nothing is really happening.</i>

<i>Then you go home
and watch some more TV.</i>

<i>Or maybe it's a fun night,
and you go out</i>

<i>and you watch a movie.</i>

I mean it's got so bad,
that half the time

the people on TV,

inside the TV,
they're watching TV.

And what are all these
people watching?

People like me.

<i>And what are all you
doing right now</i>

<i>but watching me?</i>

<i>You don't think they would
have changed the channel by now</i>

<i>if all I did
was getting "A" in geometry?</i>

Me and Kevin were playing
"Christmas kidnapping".

Kevin!

Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.

Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.

No, nott that one, you retard.

Get me a root beer. - Hey!

What?

Thanks, Celia.
I was thirsty.

Hey, you wanne know a secret?

Come closer.

Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?

It's the vacuum monster.

Cut it out!

Hey troops!
Daddy!

Ho, ho, ho. Look what I got!
Kev, come here. Give me a hand.

Yeah, sure, dad.

You wanna dance?
No thanks, Harland.

Come on. Just one.
I don't dance, really.

Where do you get off,
you stuck up bitch?

Do you think anyone else
is gonna want you now?

Come on. Stay for another drink.

Come on.
Come on.

Are you excited?
Yeah.

Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer?

We'll see.
Yeah.

Kevin!

Didn't I see you at the
bookstore today?

Nope.

Funny, I could have sworn.

By the way, are you doing
anything on Friday?

Why?

I just thought we might
do something together.

For fun.

Like, do what?

Maybe take you for dinner.

Or play around with
miniature golf?

Okay.

Why didn't you bring a coat?

You just can't get uncomfortable
enough, can you?

Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?

Whenever I see fat people,
they are always eating.

Dont' give me any of this "slow
metabolism, it's the glands" crap.

It's food.

They are fat because
they eat the wrong food.

Too much of it, and all the time.

You know, you can be
kind of harsh sometimes.

You're one to talk.

Yeah, I am.

I wonder where I got it.

Well, you won.

So. What next, momsy?

We're gonna go home. You're gonna get
changed into something reasonable.

And I'm taking you to dinner.

Great.

We're going to dinner.

I was hungry.

I'm a growing boy, you know.

I'll have a... calorie salad,

steak, medium rare,
and a bottle of merlot.

All right.

So, how's school going?

It's going.

On a course schedule.

How about your teachers?
Are there any who are...

Right, what bands am
I listening to these days?

Next you can weed all about whether there
isn't some cute little cunt

in the front row
who's got me itchy.

That way you can segway into how it's
all up to me, of course

but before balling the chick in the hallway,
that I might decide to wait until I'm ready.

Right around dessert,
you can ask about drugs.

Real careful, like

cause you don't want to scare me
into, like, lying my head off.

So you have to say
how you've experimented.

Then finally once you've sucked
up that entire bottle of wine,

you can go all gooey-eyed

and say how nice it is to spend
quality time together,

then scooch over and put your
arm around my shoulder.

Give it a little squeeze.

Fuck!

Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
Yeah. It's fucked.

And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.

Why would you let out something like that?
I collect them.

Isn't that a weird thing to collect?

I don't like stamps.

But what is the point?

There is no point.

That's the point.

No, it really hasn't been any trouble
at all. Everybody is bringing a dish.

Oh! That's them now. I got to go.
OK, you have a great day.

Bye, mom.

Merry Christmas.

Alright, Kev.
You're next.

Can you guess what it is?

That's a series 7. The guy in the
store said it was the best one.

Gee, dad. Thank you so much.
Merry Christmas. - It's perfect.

What did you eat for breakfast?

How was your day, Snuffles?

Did you hear that thump?

That's a powerful thing, man.

Celia!

Come on, honey. Time for bed.
Here we go.

I thought I closed the door.

Kevin said I'm stupid,
and he's right.

You're not stupid, honey.

Don't you worry. We'll find him.
Now you scoot down. Come on.

Cozy?

I'm sure Snuffles has gone to
the big pet store in the sky.

Don't say that! Don't say that!
Yes. It's the truth!

Dearly beloved,

We are gathered here
to mourn Mr. Snuffles...

Stop it!

...who was snuffed out... tragically early.

So daddy and mommy were looking for him
the whole night.

And you know why we couldn't find him?

Because Snuffles has gone
to live in the garden.

He's living in the garden now,

with a whole bunch of new animal friends.

Celia.

Okay, give me the spoon.

So, they're having a big party tonight...

with the chipmunks, and the squarrels,
and the racoons...

and they're eating nuts, and berries,

and they're gonna have a whole bunch...

Why did you leave the drain stuff out?

I didn't.

I put it away!
Then how did it get out?

Ask Kevin.

Kevin did it.

You need to go talk to someone.

Kev, mom had something
that she wanted to tell you.

I wanted to...

thank you for calling the ambulance.

And?

And...

I was concerned that you might
be feeling responsible.

Why is that?

Because you was supposed to
be looking after her.

We just don't want you to
blame yourself.

No. I don't...
I mean I... I never said I did.

She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.

So, we would appreciate you
looking after her,

and any namecalling...

You don't really remember being
a kid much do you, dad?

Celia is just gonna have to
suck it up.

I thought you didn't like those.

Well, they're a...
Now what do you call it...

an acquired taste.

I'm so sorry.

There you go.

Okay.

Thank you, mommy.

Hey, kiddo. Going to practice?
Yeah, you know it.

Hey, Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
No!

So...
What do you wanna do?

We'll last out the school
year if we can and...

make arrangements over the summer.

At least custody
is a no-brainer.

Is it?

You've decided?

Eva, there's nothing left to decide.

It already happened.

Needed a drink of water.
Hey you, Kev.

Listen, buddy,

it's easy to misunderstand something
when you hear it out of context.

Why would I not know the "context"?

I am the context.

You have to appeal.
No.

But you'll lose everything,
the business, your house.

I hate the house.
I always have.

You'll rot in hell!

A personal for Kevin Khatcha...
dourian?

Careful, it's heavy.
It is? - Yeah.

Have a nice day.
You, too.

What are they for?
You never ride your bike.

I got these for a song of the web.

I'll make a bundle selling them at school.

Like Donald Trump, huh.

I'll take you back to my ship.

<i>- Yeah.</i>

<i>- Yes, I did.
Did you eat all your cereal?</i>

<i>-Yes, I did.
-Alright.</i>

You're a little clammy.
Feeling okay?

Never better.

Hey, only three days to go
till you're 16.

We should do something.
How about Sunday?

Don't know.

Might be tied up.

Come on, clean up some of this mess
and then we're gonna get dressed and go.

I do not want to go to school.

I know, but daddy has to take a shower,
we have to go.

Say goodbye!

<i>Do you think we could make some time
to talk later, just the two of us,</i>

<i>without the kids?</i>

<i>I really wanna work this thing out.</i>

Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?

<i>Franklin...</i>

<i>Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin...</i>

I have my son there.

Kevin?

Kevin!

Have you seen Kevin?

Kevin!

Kevin!

Lauren!

Franklin?

Celia?

Franklin?

Celia?

You don't look happy.

Have I ever?

I'm almost 18, aren't I?

What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous?

Nervous?

Do you know anything about
those places?

Well, you managed it all so well.

Tried as a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.

You'll be out of there
in a couple years.

Do you know what day it is today?

Why the let me come see you
on a Monday?

Sure. It's my anniversary.

Two years.

Plenty of time to think about it.

I want you to tell me why.

Used to think I knew.

Now I'm not so sure.

Time's up.
