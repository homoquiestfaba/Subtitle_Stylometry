[ suspenseful music
playing ]

[ screaming ]

THESE ARE GIANT
BUTTRESS TREES HERE.

GREAT SHELTER.

IT REMINDS ME OF KAKADU
IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA,
RIGHT?

THE COVER'S SO THICK ABOVE

THAT THE LIGHT COMES IN IN LITTLE BEAMS LIKE THAT.

[ shrieks ]

LET ME SEE THAT.
GINA!

WHOO!

GINA!

GINA, GIVE IT BACK.

COME ON.
I DON'T GET A CHANCE

TO RECORD
THE MEMORIES?

HEY, JOHN, YOU READY
FOR YOUR CLOSE-UP?

[ animal screeches ]

WATCH IT
WITH THE CAMERA!

WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

WHOA!

LET ME GET THIS.

ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.

AM I RIGHT?

YOU SEE BEAUTY.

I SEE SPIDERS.

OH, WHERE?
EXACTLY. WHERE?

THAT'S WHAT BOTHERS ME.

CAN YOU GUYS
EVEN IMAGINE

WHAT MADE THIS?
YEAH, LET'S NOT.

I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

APPARENTLY,
THIS WHOLE AREA'S LOADED
WITH ARACHNIDS,

BUT WOW!

OKAY, YOU ARE
THE GUIDE, RIGHT?

I MEAN,

AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO, LIKE, KNOW THIS STUFF?
GINA.

HEY, IF IT WEREN'T
FOR A FEW SURPRISES,

AND IF I KNEW EVERYTHING,
THEN WHAT WOULD BE
THE POINT, YEAH?

OKAY, WHAT DO YOU
SAY WE GET BACK
TO WALKING OUT

FROM UNDERNEATH ALL OF THIS?
OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

YEAH, IT IS
A GOOD IDEA.

IT'S GETTING LATE.
WE'D BETTER MOVE

SO THERE'S STILL ENOUGH
LIGHT TO MAKE CAMP.

OKAY,
LET'S SHOOT THE CROW.

OH WOW, LOOK AT
THOSE BIG BUTTERFLIES.

LOOK.

OH, THAT'S AWFUL.

I DON'T WANNA SEE THAT.

CAN WE DO SOMETHING?

I THINK IT'S
A LITTLE PAST THAT.

[ insects buzzing ]

[ screaming ]

OKAY, GINA?
NO.

LOOK AT THIS.

[ laughs ]

BRIAN, WHAT EXACTLY
IS THIS?

IT'S A KIND OF
OFFERING, GERALDINE--

A SIGNPOST.

VILLAGERS
FROM KARNI MATA

LEAVE THESE
SPIDER SKINS

FOR GOOD LUCK.
COOL.

CREEPY.

ARE WE GOING THERE?
TREKKERS DON'T GO THERE.

TOO FAR OUT
OF THE WAY.

OH, THAT'S GOOD.

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN?
NO.

BUT I HEARD ABOUT IT.
APPARENTLY THERE'S
AN AMERICAN DOCTOR

WHO LIVES AMONG
THE VILLAGERS.
BEEN THERE FOR YEARS.

OH, REALLY?
IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT--

THAT WOMAN DOCTOR...

YOU KNOW, SHE LIVED
AMONGST THE APES.

YEAH, KIND OF.

[ chatting, laughing ]

SINCE THIS IS
OUR LAST NIGHT,

I JUST WANTED TO SAY
IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE

SHARING THIS EXPERIENCE
WITH YOU ALL--
APART FROM GINA.

OH, COME ON.
[ laughing ]

[ mocking laugh ]
VERY FUNNY, PHIL.

WELL, YOU DO TEND
TO COMPLAIN A LOT.
I WAS ONLY JOKING.

WHAT DID YOU SAY?

I MEAN, YOU COMPLAIN.
THAT'S, LIKE, YOUR THING.
IT'S, LIKE, EXPECTED.

RIGHT? GUYS?

WHY WOULD
YOU SAY THAT?

I DIDN'T MEAN IT
TO BE SO SERIOUS.

MAYBE ONE OF US
SHOULD SAY SOMETHING.

NO, MAN.
WITH THESE TWO?

WITH THEM GOING WAY BACK,
IT'S PROBABLY BEST NOT
TO GET INVOLVED.

OH, RIGHT, TYPES THAT TALK
ABOUT SUBTEXT

RATHER THAN WHAT'S
ACTUALLY BEING SAID, YEAH.

I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS,
BUT OKAY, BRIAN, YEAH.

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOU TWO.
OH, BRIAN.

WELL, WE WERE.

NOTHING BAD,
BUT YOU TWO WERE ARGUING.
BRIAN, JUST STOP.

OKAY, IT'S TIME
WE ALL WENT TO BED.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

WAIT A MINUTE.
WE'RE JUST GETTING
TO THE GOOD STUFF HERE.

AS A WOMAN,
I CAN TELL YOU,
NO GOOD WILL COME OF THAT.

YEAH, FOR THEM MAYBE.

YOU COMING?

NO, I THINK I'M GONNA HANG OUT
HERE FOR A WHILE LONGER.

WHY?

MAYBE I'M NOT TIRED YET.

OH, RIGHT.

[ Geraldine screams ]

OH, GOD, A SPIDER.
SPIDER!

OH MY GOD.

OH, GOD, IT BIT ME.
OH, MY GOD, THAT BURNS.

WHERE'S IT HURT, GERALDINE?
SHOULDER. IT BIT ME
ON MY SHOULDER.

[ all gasping ]

IS IT BAD?
IT FEELS REALLY BAD.
NO NO.

NO NO,
IT'S NOT BAD.

OKAY, HOOK ME UP
WITH A COLD PACK.

SOME PAINKILLER NOW.

GERALDINE, HOW'D YOU
KNOW THIS WAS A SPIDER?

I SAW IT CRAWL AWAY.
IT WENT OVER THERE.

WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?

IT WAS A SPIDER--

OH MY GOD,
IT BURNS.

WAS IT BROWN?
WAS IT BLACK, WHAT?

OH, GOD.
[ panting ]

OKAY.

IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT
LOOKED LIKE.

I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S DARK.

I DON'T KNOW.
I COULDN'T SEE IT.

HOLD THIS FOR ME,
WILL YOU?
HERE.

OH, GOD.

WHAT DO WE DO?
OH, IT LOOKS BAD, MAN.

I MEAN, IT'S REAL BAD
TO GET THAT STRONG
A REACTION STRAIGHTAWAY.

OKAY, SO WHAT DO WE DO?
IF SHE DOESN'T
GET HELP SOON--

IT'S A FULL DAY'S HIKE INTO TOWN. BY THAT TIME, SHE COULD BE--

WHAT ABOUT THE VILLAGE?

THE DOCTOR?

YEAH, RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT'S
GONNA HAVE TO HAPPEN.

YOU SAID THAT WAS WAY
OUT OF THE WAY.

IT'S STILL NEARER THAN TOWN.
YOU SURE THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE SOMETHING FOR THIS?

Brian:
WELL, IF WHAT I'VE HEARD
ABOUT THAT DOCTOR IS TRUE.

WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR?

WE SHOULD LEAVE
RIGHT NOW.

YOU SURE THIS IS THE WAY?
SO SAYS THE MAP.

BUT HAVING NEVER BEEN,
I CAN'T SAY I'M CERTAIN.

I COULD HAVE REALLY USED
A "YES" THERE, MAN.
LIE TO ME!

HOW'S GERALDINE?
NOT GOOD.

DID YOU GIVE HER
MORE PAINKILLER?

YEAH, LIKE HALF
THE BOTTLE.

[ labored breathing ]

WE-- WE NEED HELP.

SICK.

SPIDER.

SHOULD WE FOLLOW HIM?

YEAH, I THINK
THAT'S THE PLAN.

COME ON.

[ raspy breathing ]

[ speaking
native language ]

WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

BRING HER IN.

QUICK, LIKE SILVER.

[ gagging ]

IS SHE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?
PATIENCE, LIKE JOB.

PATIENCE, LIKE JOB.

THAT ONE.
THAT ONE, YES.

[ blowing ]

WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

SHH, SHH, SHH.

[ squeals ]

NO, HONESTLY,
I DON'T WANT IT.
I DON'T WANT IT.

NO NO NO,
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY
REALLY NICE...

NO, THANK YOU.
NO, THANK YOU.

NO, THANK YOU.
NO, THANK YOU.

I DON'T...
I DON'T WANT IT.

[ gasps ]

[ grunting ]

WHAT'S HAPPENING?

WHY DON'T YOU GO
OUTSIDE AND WAIT...

AND LET ME DO THIS?

COME ON, BRIAN.

ALL RIGHT.
HE'S A DOCTOR.

Doctor: YES, LET IT GO.

TAKE IT EASY.

LET IT GO.

YES YES YES.

HOW'S GERALDINE?

[ villagers chanting ]

OKAY,

WHEN THE GUY WITH THE SACK
ON HIS HEAD COMES,

THAT'S KIND OF MY CUE
TO LEAVE.

YES, SIR, FOR ONCE
THE GIRL SPEAKS SOME SENSE.

ANYONE? ANYONE KNOW
WHAT SHE'S SAYING?

IT'S A SPELL
OF PROTECTION.

TO THEM,
SPIDERS ARE GODS.

SHE'S--
SHE'S MAKING

AN ATTEMPT
TO GET THE GODS

WHICH TAKE CARE
OF THEM,

AND NOW YOU.

YEAH, WELL,
YOU CAN TELL THEM

I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF SPIDERS, THANKS.

YOU'RE ALL LOOKING
A LITTLE WORSE
FOR THE WEAR.

GERALDINE,
HOW IS SHE?

NOT GOOD. UNFORTUNATELY,
YOUR FRIEND WAS BITTEN

BY A BOLIVIAN
BAJA SPIDER.

ATRAX ROBUSTUS.

EVEN THE SMALLEST DROP
OF VENOM, A PINHEAD,

IS LETHAL
TO SMALL ANIMALS.

FORTUNATELY, THOUGH,
THE SAME SPIDER

PRODUCES HIS OWN
ANTI-VENOM.

HUMANS CAN'T EVEN HOLD

TWO OPPOSING THOUGHTS
TOGETHER

WITHOUT GOING OFF
THE DEEP END.

BUT SPIDERS--
Gina: FORGET ABOUT
THE SPIDERS.

WHAT ABOUT THE HUMANS?

HOW MUCH IS LETHAL?

ONLY LESS THAN A DROP,
A LITTLE LESS.

AND GERALDINE?

SHE'S BETWEEN THIS WORLD
AND THE NEXT.

I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I CAN
WITH WHAT I'VE GOT.

AND NOW...

WE'RE IN THE PROVERBIAL
WAITING GAME.

[ speaks
native language ]

WHAT?
WHAT?

SO WHAT NOW?

SHE NEEDS REAL HELP.

THE REST OF YOU SHOULD
FOLLOW THE TRAIL BACK,

HEAD TO TOWN. I'LL STAY HERE WITH GERALDINE.

YOU'RE NOT STAYING
HERE BY YOURSELF.
IT'LL BE FINE.

IT'LL BE FINE.
YOU'RE ALL WELCOME
TO STAY.

I ASSURE YOU

THAT NO ONE OUT THERE
COULD DO ANY MORE THAN
I'VE ALREADY DONE.

REST, EAT.

I'LL TAKE CARE
OF YOUR FRIEND.

OKAY, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO WAY THAT I'M STAYING HERE.

IS EVERYONE JUST FORGETTING
ABOUT THE GUY

WITH THE SACK
ON HIS HEAD?

OKAY, I'LL LEAD
THE GROUP BACK

AND WE'LL TRY
TO FIND SOME HELP--

A MEDICAL AIRLIFT,
AMBULANCE,

WHATEVER
THEY USE OUT HERE.

BRIAN, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO STAY?

YEAH, I SHOULD.

I'LL STAY TOO.

SOMEONE SHOULD STAY.

OKAY, STACEY, THERE IS
ABSOLUTELY NO WAY

THAT YOU CAN
STAY HERE ON YOUR--
WE CAN'T JUST RUN OFF.

YOU CANNOT STAY HERE--
I'M STAYING.

AND WHAT DO
YOU CARE ANYWAY?

IT'LL GIVE YOU MORE TIME
TO SPEND WITH HIM.

STACEY, DON'T GET ALL--
JUST GO.

YOU SURE YOU
WANNA STAY HERE?
DEFINITELY.

IT'LL BE AN ADVENTURE.

ANYONE ELSE FEEL LIKE
WE'RE BEING WATCHED?

HOW CREEPY.

COME ON,
LET'S JUST KEEP GOING.

ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT?

IT'S A MAP, PHIL.

I THINK I CAN
HANDLE IT.

YOU KNOW,
AS UNTHRILLED AS I AM

TO BE OUT HERE,
I AM STILL MUCH
MORE RELIEVED

TO BE AWAY
FROM THAT PLACE.

THAT DOCTOR
GAVE ME THE CREEPS.

I THOUGHT HE WAS
KIND OF COOL.

HE WAS LIKE THE COLONEL
AT THE END OF THAT MOVIE.

PHIL...

"LIVING WITH THE NATIVES."
EXCEPT HE'S NOT CRAZY.

YEAH, WELL,

YOU'D HAVE TO BE CRAZY
TO WANT TO LIVE OUT HERE.

AHH, HERE WE ARE.
EAT.

EAT, MANGE.

[ insects buzzing ]

YOU KNOW, I HAD
AN ENERGY BAR EARLIER.

I'M STILL GOOD ON THAT.
I'M NOT HUNGRY.
I'LL JUST...

DOCTOR, YOU SAID THAT

GERALDINE, IT WAS
A BOLIVIAN SPIDER?

A BAJA SPIDER.
VERY VENOMOUS,
BUT STUNNING.

ALL SPIDERS ARE VENOMOUS. IT'S ALL ABOUT NECROSIS.

BUT YOU SAY BOLIVIAN,

AND I THINK
OF SOMETHING LIKE
SOUTH AMERICA

OR SOMETHING NOT...
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

YOU'RE SAYING
NOT HERE, RIGHT?
Stacey: YEAH.

WELL, THAT'S
AN ASTUTE OBSERVATION.

AND I'LL TRY TO OVERLOOK
YOUR THINLY-VEILED ATTEMPT

TO DOUBT MY EXPERTISE.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
WHAT SHE'S SAYING.

I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

THIS SPOT ON THE PLANET
IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER SPOT
ON EARTH.

YOUR ASSUMPTION IS RIGHT.

YES, ALL SPIDERS
ARE REGIONAL,

EVERY CLASS OF THEM.
WE HAVE BAJA SPIDERS

AND BLACK WIDOWS
SPINNING WEBS TOGETHER

ALONG WITH BROWN RECLUSE THAT'S ONLY FOUND IN NORTH AMERICA.

AND THEN THERE'S THE BUTTON SPIDER

FROM AFRICA.

FASCINATING, ISN'T IT?
YEAH.

YEAH.

[ spits ]

OH MY GOD!

THAT'S A MADAGASCAR.

IT'S POISONOUS?
DEADLY.

[ Stacey screams ]
[ villagers laughing ]

THAT'S MY BROTHER.

HIS COWL IS MADE OUT
OF SPIDER'S SILK.

HE'S HERE TO REMIND ME

THAT I NEED TO CHECK IN
ON YOUR FRIEND.

THE KARNI MATA TEMPLE,
IS THAT NEAR?

OH, IT'S JUST A RUMOR
IN THE GUIDEBOOK, YEAH?

NO, IT'S HERE.
IT'S AS OLD AS THE MOUNTAINS.

MAYBE WE SHOULD
STAY HERE, YEAH?

THEY'RE GONNA
BE GONE FOR HOURS.

WE MIGHT AS WELL
TAKE A LOOK.
IT'S NOT FAR.

I CAN SEND A MAN
TO SHOW YOU THE WAY.
GREAT.

I WAGER IT'LL BE AN EXPERIENCE
YOU'LL NEVER FORGET.

WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

THE ROCKS,
THEY'RE SHAPED
LIKE A SPIDER.

HEAD, LEGS, EVERYTHING.
FANGS, YEAH?

CAN WE GO IN...

HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?
INSIDE.

LET'S GO INSIDE.

MAYBE WE SHOULD
HEAD BACK NOW.

OH!

OH!

WOW!

OH MY GOD.

HEY.

BOMBAY MIX.
EW!

[ Stacey screams ]

STACEY.

STACEY.

[ echoing ]
STACEY!

YEAH?
DON'T DO THAT.

JUST STAY WHERE
I CAN SEE YOU.

OKAY, DAD.

STACEY?

OH, MAN.

DON'T MOVE.
DON'T MOVE.

WHAT?
[ gasps ]

GET IT OFF.

BRIAN, COME ON.
HURRY UP, BRIAN.

GET IT OFF. OH!

ONE MORE.
ONE MORE?

WHERE?
SHH SHH SHH.

[ screams ]

WHERE DID IT GO?

WE CAN GO NOW?
YEAH, LET'S GO.

[ car horn honks ]

ISN'T THAT...
TRAFFIC, YES!

YES, LET'S GO!

DON'T REMEMBER THIS.
WE DIDN'T GO THIS FAR IN.

THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

OKAY, SO WE TURN
THE CORNER AND...

LET'S JUST GO BACK.

OKAY, SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU GOT THE SPIDER OFF
OF ME, YEAH?

I THINK SO.

YEAH, I'M SURE IT IS.

THEN WHERE IS IT?
IT HAS TO BE HERE
SOMEWHERE.

THERE IT IS.
THERE IT IS.

BRIAN!

BRIAN?

BRI?

BRIAN?

[ echoing ]
OKAY, NOT FUNNY!

I'LL BE OUTSIDE,
OKAY?

OKAY, BRIAN?

OH, GOD.

OH!
OH GOD!

[ gears grinding ]

[ laughing ]

STILL, I GOTTA SAY,
MAN,

IT'S BETTER THAN
THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT
BACK IN PHILLY.

SMELLS BETTER TOO.
NO, THAT'S JUST ME.

YOU?
YEAH.

OH MY GOD.
THAT IS NOT YOU.
YOU ARE SO CHEEKY.

I SMELL BETTER
THAN THAT.

THIS REMINDS ME OF THE BUS
SERVICE IN SWAZILAND.

YOU KNOW SWAZILAND?
AFRICA, AFRICA.

IT'S A SMALL ISLAND
OFF MADAGASCAR.

OH, SORRY.

IT'S OKAY.

SHOULD I BE OFFENDED
THAT YOU DIDN'T LINGER
WHEN YOU SLAMMED INTO ME?

OH, I DID.

IT JUST WENT QUICKLY.

KAKADU,
NORTHERN AUSTRALIA--

[ gears grind ]

ETHIOPIA?

OKAY, HELLO.

HELLO.

OH, GOD,
WHERE AM I?

I'M SURE IT WAS
THIS WAY. OKAY.

OH...

BRIAN?

BRIAN?

BRIAN.

[ screaming ]

OH MY GOD!

[ screaming ]

[ screaming ]

[ horn honking ]

END. NO FURTHER.
I GO NOWHERE.

HEY!

PHIL, WHY DON'T YOU
GO FIND THE HOTEL?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

GERALDINE--
I'M GONNA FIND SOME HELP.

OKAY, I'M GOING WITH.
PHIL, YOU COOL WITH THAT?

YEAH, SHOULDN'T BE
TOO HARD TO FIND.

I'LL JUST LOOK
FOR A BUILDING
WITH AN ACTUAL DOOR.

WHOA. WHOLE NEW
KIND OF TRAFFIC.
OH MY GOD.

[ speaking
foreign language ]

FOUND IT.
THIS WAY.

John: THERE'S PROBABLY MORE PEOPLE ON THIS WALL

THAN THERE ARE
IN THE ACTUAL TOWN.

I KNOW.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

DO ME A FAVOR,
IF I EVER GO MISSING,

PLEASE USE A PHOTO
WHERE AT LEAST
I LOOK GOOD.

WHAT?
NOTHING.

OH, COME ON, I WAS JOKING.
[ speaking foreign language ]

WE NEED HELP.

HELLO?

WE NEED... YOU...

YOUR HELP.

DO YOU NOT
SPEAK ENGLISH?

OH, YEAH, BUT I...

OH, SO DO YOU.

PRETTY WELL I'M TOLD.

SORRY.

I'M SERGEANT
DURANJAYA CHADHRI.

OH, HI.

HI.

SORRY ABOUT THIS OFFICE.
IT IS A BIT OF MESS, HUH?

MORE MISSING PHOTOS?
GINA.

HARD NOT TO NOTICE,
ISN'T IT?

YEAH, KIND OF.
SEE HERE?

MY PREDECESSOR.
MISSING FOR TWO MONTHS.

SO YOU'VE ONLY BEEN
HERE FOR...
TWO WEEKS.

TWO VERY LONG WEEKS.

BUT THEY KEEP PUTTING ME
IN POSTINGS WHERE NOBODY
ELSE WANTS TO GO.

[ bell dings ]

AND AS FOR YOU TWO?
OH, WE WERE ON A TREK,

A WHOLE BUNCH OF US,

AND ONE OF OUR GROUP
GOT BIT BY A SPIDER.

HUH, A SPIDER?

YEAH, REAL BAD.

AND WE HAD TO TAKE HER
TO THIS VILLAGE,

BUT SHE NEEDS SOME
SERIOUS MEDICAL ATTENTION.

YEAH, SO IS THERE
A HELICOPTER WE CAN TAKE?

LOAD UP WITH SUPPLIES
AND THEN WE CAN--
A HELICOPTER?

[ laughs ]

SORRY.

I DO NOT MEAN
TO BE DISRESPECTFUL.

DO YOU REMEMBER THE NAME
OF THE VILLAGE?

UH... KAR...

KAR...
KORLI...

KARNI MATA?
YEAH.

YOU KNOW IT?
HE KNOWS IT.

IT'S A VILLAGE MUCH TALKED
ABOUT BY THE LOCALS,

SHROUDED IN LOCAL COLOR
AND LEGEND.

BUT I HAVE BEEN SO BUSY
TRYING TO GET ACQUAINTED
WITH THIS TOWN,

I HAVE YET TO GO
INTO THE JUNGLE
AND LOOK AROUND.

SHE WAS TREATED
BY THE DOCTOR,

BUT HE SAID THEY WERE
GONNA NEED MORE SUPPLIES

IF SHE WAS,

YOU KNOW, GONNA LIVE.

SO YOUR FRIENDS
ARE THERE, TOO?
YEAH.

OKAY, I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

[ heart beating ]

[ screaming ]

[ screams ]

[ chanting ]

CIVILIZATION HAS BEATEN
A PATH TO MY DOOR.

I'M LECORPUS.

DR. LECORPUS.

YOU MUST BE THE ILLUSTRIOUS
NEW TOWN SERGEANT.

SERGEANT CHADHRI, YES.

WELL, I'M REALLY HAPPY
TO MEET YOU FACE TO FACE,

ALTHOUGH IT BROUGHT ME
GREAT PAIN TO HEAR ABOUT
YOUR PREDECESSOR.

I HOPE HE TURNS UP.
SO DO I.

YEAH, I HEARD
THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE

THAT YOU ARE RUNNING
A TIGHT SHIP IN YOUR TOWN.

I DON'T RUN THE TOWN.
I JUST PROTECT IT.

REALLY?

THEY REALLY GET
WHIPPED INTO A FRENZY
WITH NEWCOMERS.

WHAT IS THAT?

IT'S MY BROTHER.

BROTHER?
YEAH.

HE SUFFERS FROM A SEVERE
BONE DEFORMITY

AND I'M TREATING HIM.

THE NATIVES HERE
THINK OF HIM AS A GOD
BECAUSE OF IT.

HE HATES CIVILIZATION.

IT'S WELL-FOUNDED.

YOU CAME BECAUSE
OF THE GIRL?

THAT'S RIGHT.
HOW IS SHE?
GONE.

DEAD?
NO, SHE'S WELL ENOUGH.

THEY GOT AN EARLY START.
YOU KNOW HOW THE JUNGLE
CAN BE AFTER DARK.

I SEE.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

WELL, YOU CAN GIVE ME
MY GUN BACK.

OH, OF COURSE.

OH, YEAH.

BY THE WAY,
WHAT'S THE WORD
ON THE HELICOPTER?

HELICOPTER?
YES, DON'T YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE HELICOPTER?

NO, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT A HELICOPTER.

DO YOU MIND
IF I TAKE A LOOK AROUND?
NO, I DON'T.

MAYBE VISIT THE TEMPLE.

HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT IT,
NEVER SEEN IT,
BUT MOST CURIOUS.

IT IS SPECTACULAR.

IT WILL MAKE
YOUR TRIP WORTHWHILE.

IT'S GONNA BE
A WHILE YET, GINA.

YOU MIGHT AS WELL
SIT DOWN,

GO TO YOUR ROOM,
HANG OUT AND STUFF.

AND STUFF?

YEAH, NICE TRY.

YOU'RE MAKING ME TIRED
JUST WATCHING YOU.

I JUST FEEL GUILTY,
YOU KNOW?

I KNEW IT.

I SHOULD HAVE STAYED
WITH STACEY, OKAY?

THERE.

I MEAN, THAT WAS
THE WHOLE POINT

OF THIS STUPID VACATION.

I TAKE IT THIS WASN'T
YOUR FIRST CHOICE.

GEE, YOU THINK?

[ speaks
foreign language ]

HELLO?

HELLO?

[ hisses ]

[ screams ]

[ spider hisses ]
[ screaming ]

[ stomping ]

[ clicks ]

[ spider hisses ]

[ gasps ]

HEY.

[ yawns ]

IS STACEY BACK YET?

NOT YET.

PHIL'S HEADING TO
THE NEXT TOWN RIGHT NOW.

IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE...

UPDATED
THAN THIS ONE.

[ insects buzzing ]

YOU THINK MAYBE CHADHRI'S TAKEN
GERALDINE TO THE HOSPITAL?

YEAH, MAYBE.
HUH?

I'M GONNA HEAD
BACK TO THE VILLAGE,

SEE WHAT THERE IS TO SEE.

MAYBE THE DOCTOR
SAW OR HEARD SOMETHING.

YEAH, OR MAYBE THE DOCTOR
AND HIS SACK-HEAD BROTHER

ARE IN ON IT.
IN ON WHAT?

WHATEVER IT IS THAT STACEY
AND THE REST ARE CAUGHT UP IN.

THE DOCTOR
WASN'T A THREAT!

A LITTLE BIT
ECCENTRIC, YES.

YEAH, WELL,
I'M GOING BACK WITH YOU.

NO.

LOOK, YOU'RE STAYING HERE.

THERE NEEDS
TO BE SOMEONE HERE
WHEN THEY DO TURN UP.

YEAH, AND SOMEBODY ELSE
CAN DO THAT.

GINA, I'VE TOLD YOU ALREADY,
I'M GONNA HEAD TO THE VILLAGE,

PHIL'S OUT LOOKING
FOR THE NEXT TOWN--
JOHN!

I CAN EITHER
GO WITH YOU
OR WITHOUT YOU.

EITHER WAY I'M GOING.

THAT'S IT OVER THERE.

[ pounds on truck ]

[ helicopter whirring ]

YOU HEAR THAT?

YEAH, LOOK,
A HELICOPTER.

THAT'S PROBABLY THEM NOW!

SEE? THEY MUST HAVE WAITED
FOR THE HELICOPTER,

BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T
RISK MOVING GERALDINE
THROUGH THE JUNGLE.

CASE CLOSED, NANCY DREW.

YEAH.
THAT MAKES SENSE.

EXCEPT WHEN WE ASKED THAT
CHADHRI GUY FOR A HELICOPTER,

WHAT DID HE DO?

LAUGHED.
IN OUR FACES.

[ tribal music playing ]

YOU HEAR THAT?

YEAH.
COME ON.

[ villagers howling ]

[ howling continues ]

[ breathing rapidly ]

[ grunting ]

[ screaming ]

[ groaning ]

[ horns blaring ]

[ whimpering ]

[ screaming ]
OH GOD!

HELP ME!
HELP ME!

[ all howling ]

[ Stacey continues

STACEY!
GINA.

GINA! NO, GINA.

DON'T SAY A WORD.

[ screaming ]

Stacey:

HELP ME!

DON'T LOOK, DON'T LOOK.

[ screaming ]

[ gagging ]

FOR YOU!

[ villagers continue
chanting ]

Stacey:

[ gagging ]

[ frenzied howling ]

[ drums pounding rapidly ]

DON'T LOOK, GINA!
DON'T LOOK.

[ grunts ]
RUN!

NOT THAT WAY!

GINA!

[ grunts ]

STACEY!

STACEY, COME ON.
STACEY!

STACEY!
STACEY, COME ON.

[ screaming ]
COME ON! COME ON!

STACEY, COME ON.

SHE'S NOT DEAD.

SHE'S PARALYZED.

THE VENOM.

NO PAIN.

NO NOTHING.

[ screams ]

OH GOD!

[ whimpers ]

STACEY!
GINA!

YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT
FOR ME, BROTHER.

OH, WHERE THE HELL
HAS SHE GONE NOW?!

GINA!

[ whimpering ]

OKAY.
GET A GRIP.

IT'S OKAY.

OKAY, STACEY!

OKAY.
GINA, GET A GRIP.

IT'S OKAY.

[ yelling
in native language ]

[ gasps ]

[ screaming ]

[ shouting

[ spider sizzles ]

[ panting ]

GINA!

[ whispering ]
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

[ trembling ]
IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

[ screaming ]

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

LEAVE IT!

GINA!
[ screaming ]

[ grunting ]

GINA!

[ screams ]

YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

YOU KNOW, IF I HAD MY WAY,

STACEY AND I WOULD BE ON AN ISLAND SOMEWHERE

DRINKING MARGARITAS.

[ laughs ]

ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

YEAH, I TELL YOU WHAT,

WHEN WE GET
OUT OF HERE

I'LL BUY YOU
THAT MARGARITA.

TELL YOU WHAT,
WE GET OUT OF HERE

I'M GONNA HOLD YOU TO THAT.

[ chattering ]

I CANNOT HELP YOU, SIR.

THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HERE.

OF COURSE YOU'LL
STAY HERE A LONG TIME.

EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.
HEY! HEY!

EXCUSE ME--
[ all shouting ]

YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

[ speaking
foreign language ]

YOU SHOULD REALLY
PAY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.

RONALD REAGAN'S STILL
AN ACTOR IN THIS ARTICLE.

HOLY...

[ all shouting ]

I'VE GOT A REALLY
BIG PROBLEM.

YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
SHH!

SEE THIS GUY?

OH...

WHAT IS IT?

[ beeping ]

IT WORKS.

LET ME SEE IT.

GINA, YOU--
YOU SHOULDN'T WATCH THIS.

JOHN, LET ME SEE IT.

JOHN, LET ME SEE IT!

Stacey:
Brian?

Brian?

Brian?

[ screaming ]

Oh my God!
Oh my God!

[ screaming ]

[ Gina crying ]

OH MY GOD.

OH MY GOD, STACEY.

[ screaming ]

BRIAN!

GINA, GET THIS
STUFF OFF HIM.

JOHN, HE BLINKED.
HE WHAT?

HE BLINKED.
BRIAN?

[ groaning ]
HELP... ME...

WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU OUT OF THIS.

Gina: HOLD ON, BRIAN. IT'S OKAY.

[ Brian whimpering ]
OKAY, BRIAN.

HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

YOU'RE OKAY.
HOLD ON.

[ gasping ]
HELP ME.

YOU'RE GONNA BE
OKAY, BRIAN.

[ gasping ]

BRIAN?

BRIAN! COME ON!

[ echoing ]
BRIAN!

[ sobbing ]

HELLO?

OH, CHADHRI!
OH, THANK GOD.
OH MAN!

John: SERGEANT CHADHRI.

YOUR FRIEND?

YEAH.
OUR GUIDE BRIAN.

HOW THE HELL DO WE
GET OUT OF HERE?

I AM STILL TRYING
TO WORK THAT ONE OUT.

WE FOLLOW THEM.

PERHAPS THEY LEAD US
TO A WAY OUT.

PERHAPS THEY LEAD US

Chadhri:
A HARVESTING STATION.
A WHAT?

Chadhri:
FOR HUMAN ORGANS.

YES. YES, TO SELL
ON THE BLACK MARKET.

SEE THESE TUBES?

THEY ARE PROBABLY USED
TO EXTRACT THE VENOM.

VENOM?

[ chuckles ]
QUITE SMART ACTUALLY.

USING THAT
TO INDUCE PARALYSIS

SLOWS DOWN THE ATROPHY
OF THE ORGANS.

I'M SORRY, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

TO KEEP THEM FRESH
FOR THE TRANSPORT.

OH MY GOD!

MY PREDECESSOR.

INVINCIBLE YOUTH
REALLY MAKES ME FEEL

A GOOD POINT FOR YOU
TO GIVE UP.

DID YOU THINK YOU'LL EVER
GET OUT OF THIS JUNGLE ALIVE?

THE TALWAR
WILL CUT YOU DOWN

AND I'LL BARTER
WITH YOUR ORGANS.

BUT NO, NOT YET.

NOTHING.

HAVE YOU BEEN UP?

YES.

I GOT AS FAR
