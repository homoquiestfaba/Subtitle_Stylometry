<i>Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.</i>

[crowd cheering and applauding]

[outlaw country music playing]

<i>â™ª I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since I don't know when â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm stuck in Folsom prison â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And time keeps draggin' on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But that train
Keeps a rollin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª On down to San Antone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When I was just a baby
My mama told me, "Son" â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª "Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns" â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When I hear
That whistle blowin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I hang my head and cry â™ª</i>




[country music continues
playing in other room]


[door opens]

I got another 15.

Not today, you don't.
You're up.

You know the deal.

Successfully complete
the mission,

you get ten years
off your sentence.

<i>You fail to follow my orders
in any way</i>

<i>and I detonate the explosive
device in the base of your skull.</i>

Good dog.

a black ops unit.</i>

<i>Meaning, nothing you see here
ever happened.</i>


will be Colonel Rick Flag.</i>

Or would you
rather be called Durlin?

I'd rather not
be called at all.

But I'll do anything
to get out of this hellhole.

welcome to "anything."

[instrumental rock music
playing]

So this is
the famous Suicide Squad.

that term degrading.

The official term
is "Task Force X."

And love 'em or hate 'em,

these are your brothers and
sisters for the next few days.

[hums teasingly] Oh!

Whoa.


[instrumental rock music
continues playing]


Blackguard.

Mongal.

Javelin.

T.D.K.

Weasel.

And, of course...

Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
Had to go number two.

Hmm, good to know.

Flag.

Oh, sorry. Comin' through.

Hey, Boomer.

What are you doing back
in prison, Harls?

I got road rage. In a bank.

[grunts]
Oh. So sorry. Comin' through.

Turn it around. There. No.
There? Here?

Put it in there.
Now you're safe.

All right.

Thanks, man.

And away we go.

[Emilia] Harley and T.D.K...
[Flo] Digger.

together before?


Savant do again?


He's an expert in weapons
and hand-to-hand combat.

Yeah, well, I'm putting 20
on him that he's gonna bite it.

Me too. And Weasel,

Boomer and Mongal.
[John] Yeah, I think...

or some type of god?

What are you doing?
Oh. Hey.

Just making sure
everything was ready to go.


Just our normal,
casual morning meeting.

Yeah, I just gotta, uh,
do this thing.


[Flo] Okay.
[John] Oh, yeah.

[phone rings]

Flag.

from the drop.</i>

Get the whole team safely

<i>to that beach, Colonel.</i>

<i>You will receive
further orders once there.</i>

[smacking lips]

[sighs]
[Boomerang laughs]

We're in
a butcher's freezer, Harls,

surrounded by dead hogs
hangin' on hooks.

Only they don't know it yet.

Leave him alone, Boomer.

What does T.D.K. stand for?

What?

Your name is T.D.K., correct?

Yeah.

And it stands for what?

It stands for me.

It's what a name is.

Your name is letters?

All names are letters,
dickhead.

I love your accent.

American women
all love accents.

We do.
'Cause we don't got none.


Yo, is this a dog?
What?

Is this thing a dog?

A... A dog?
Yes.

What kind of dog
do you think it is, mate?

I don't know, I'm not familiar
with all the breeds.

I'm gonna go with Afghan Hound.

Since when does an Afghan
Hound have bloody thumbs?

Oh, my God, is it a werewolf?

I've wanted to meet
a werewolf forever.

Yo, they sat me
next to a werewolf?

[T.D.K.] That's not right.

Yo, let me out.
I do not fuck with werewolves.

Hey, hey,
he's not a werewolf, okay!

He's a weasel. He's harmless.

I mean, he's not harmless,
he's killed 27 children,

but, you know, we got him to...

I think he's agreed to do this.

Whatever the case,

just everyone
get into position to drop.

[Weasel chitters]

[dramatic instrumental
rock music playing]

[instrumental rock music
continues]

[Weasel screaming]


Did anyone check
on whether Weasel could swim?

[Weasel continues yelping]

[gurgling and coughing]

[Savant grunting]

[John sighs]

[continues grunting]

The Weasel is dead! I repeat,

<i>the Weasel is dead.</i>
[sighs]

Northeast, all clear.
Approach the shore.

<i>Over.</i>

Savant, hold your position.

Roger that.

[menacing music playing]

Amateurs.

Waller, we're
on the beach and dry.

[Harley laughs]

Blackguard. Get down, you...
Hey, guys! Hey.

...there's fucking soldiers
everywhere!

You can come out now,
it's just me.

What the fuck
is Blackguard doin'?

I'm the one who contacted you.

Is this what's supposed
to happen? What the fuck?

Blackguard, get back
into your position.

Look, look.
I brought everybody, look.

They're right behind me.

Whoa. Hey.

Hey, guys. Whoa.

We got a deal, right?
Uh... Uh...

Waller, we're made.

I'm the one who called you.

[officers shouting
indistinctly]

Blackguard sold us out.

<i>He contacted the fucking
Corto Maltese Army!</i>

<i>Waller, we need to retreat.</i>

Negative, Flag.

The mission is too important.

<i>This is a tough group.</i>

<i>You can make it.</i>
Okey-doke.

Waller, with all due respect,
we're in the middle

of a goddamn... Harley, wait!

Whoo-hoo!

[soldiers screaming]

[instrumental rock music
playing]


[all grunt]


Zero-two-two-seven
is wide open.

Colonel, dispatch

<i>The Detachable Kid.</i>
T.D.K., two o'clock!

T.D.K. is "The Detachable Kid"?

[grunting]
[Savant groans]

[soldiers groaning]

What the fuck?

I didn't pick the damn team!

Don't worry, Flag,
I got the bird.

Mongal! Don't.
[Mongal yelling]

Huh?
[shrieking]


[Mongal continues shrieking]

[engine whining]

Strewth!

Boomer!






[pained screaming
and groaning continue]


Savant is off the rails.

Savant, turn back.

[instrumental rock music
playing]

<i>Savant.</i>
[continues yelling]

[weapons firing]

Savant, I'm warning you,
this is desertion.

[Savant yelling fearfully]

Savant!

This is your last chance.
Turn back around.

<i>You are in violation
of your agreement!</i>


[beeping]
[Savant continues yelling]


Damn it.

[weapon whirring]

[weapon fires]


[distant gunfire]

How's Team Two holding up?

Set point bravo.

All troops on the south beach
are engaged.

Team Two is clear to go
on the north beach.

Congratulations, Bloodsport.

[breathing heavily]


How'd you do it, Waller?

<i>There's no soldiers out here
on patrol at all.</i>

[Waller on radio] <i>Let's
just say they were distracted.</i>

[punk rock music playing]

<i>â™ª Teddy sniffing glue

Oh.

Here you go, champ.

Excuse me.

Who the fuck is Bloodsport?

Robert DuBois.

A world-class marksman.

In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

His father was a mercenary

who trained his son to kill
from the moment he was born.

He's in prison for putting
Superman in the ICU

with a kryptonite bullet.

DuBois?
Same answer as the last time.

Piss off.

I'm not joining your goddamn
Suicide Squad.

We'll see.

You have a visitor.

[door buzzes, opens]

They said you got in trouble.

<i>I stole.</i>

You stole what?

<i>A style watch.</i>
A star latch?

A style watch.
You can watch TV on it.

<i>Why would you want to
watch TV on your watch?</i>

I don't know.

<i>Next time you want
to nick something,</i>

<i>you take a partner,</i>

<i>and they can be your lookout.</i>

<i>That's your advice?</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>You're a terrible father.</i>

<i>Hey, I didn't ask to be a
father in the first place.</i>

<i>You make that perfectly clear.</i>

Your mother sprung
that one on me.

<i>Well, she's not around anymore,</i>

<i>so you can lay off
of her, okay?</i>

<i>Oh, I tried to lay off her,</i>

but then she dragged out
the paternity test.

<i>Fuck you!</i>
<i>No, fuck you!</i>

<i>Fuck you!</i>
<i>Fuck you!</i>

Fuck you!
Fuck you!

<i>Fuck you!</i>
Fuck you!

<i>Fuck you!</i>

I can't believe
you don't care that I stole,

only that I got caught!

I don't only care
that you got caught,

I care that you got caught
for stealing

something as stupid
as a fucking TV watch!

It does other things too!

<i>But nothing that your phone
can't fucking do!</i>

<i>It's embarrassing!</i>

<i>No, what's fucking embarrassing</i>

<i>is having you as my father.</i>

[smacks lips]

<i>Yeah, well, I told you, Tyla,</i>

<i>when I came here
that any goodness</i>

I ever had in me had been
wrung out bare by my old man.

And I also told you to go out
there and do your own thing

and stay far away

<i>from me or anyone like me,
didn't I?</i>

So, why are you here
when you and I both know

I have nothing good
to offer you?

<i>Because my court date
is coming up,</i>

<i>and Miss Waller said
maybe you could help me out.</i>

To get me to lead
your shite fucking mission,

you're gonna send my
14-year-old daughter to prison?

No.

Your daughter is 16, DuBois.

You're a real
father of the year.

Fine. You know what,
Tyla needs to grow up anyway

'cause she's a little ditzy
like her fucking mother.

So, a year in juvie,
no fucking problem.

Not juvie. Being 16
in the state of Louisiana

means that
under the right circumstances,

she could be tried as an adult.

And, if convicted,

could be sent right here
to old Belle Reve.

And in here, well, you never
know what might happen

to a frail young thing
like that.

Shames me to say

that we have
the highest mortality rate

in the entire
U.S. prison system.


You're threatening
my fucking daughter!

I'm protecting this country.

Everyone stand down.
Miss Waller, I...

Stand down!

[Bloodsport breathing heavily]

I wouldn't take
such extreme measures...

Oh, extreme?
Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

...if this mission
weren't more important

than you could
possibly imagine.

Fuck your mission.

You have the military
experience necessary,

and everything in your
psychological profile tells me

you have what it takes
to be a leader.

No, I'm no fucking leader!

Then I'll make you one.

[dramatic music playing]

Are you in or out?

Good. Let's meet your team.

Come on.
Fuck me, man.


She was gonna kill his kid?

of the team is chosen

for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

This is Christopher Smith,
known as Peacemaker.

In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

His father was a soldier
who trained his son

how to kill from the moment
he was born.

Are you having a laugh?
What?

You just said each member
of the team is chosen

for their unique abilities.
He does exactly what I do.

But better.

I always hit
my targets dead center.

I hit them more in the center.

Well, you can't hit something
more in a center.

I use smaller bullets.
What?

They go inside
your bullet holes

without even touching the side.

Next up is King Shark.


What the fuck?


that Nanaue is a descendant
of an ancient shark god.

Whatever the case,
he's strong and deadly.

Does it talk?

[King Shark] Book read.
[Bloodsport] Wow. [chuckles]

Book's upside-down.

See that? It's pretending
to read a book.

So smart, me.
Enjoy book so much.

Be a mite careful,

as he's developed a taste
for human meat.

Huh?

Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

Ratcatcher 2.
[inmate whistles]

[inmates cheering]
Settle down!

Ooh.

What, we couldn't
afford Ratcatcher 1?

He's dead.
This is his daughter.


Cazo, will you be joining us?


I don't function well
early in the morning.

My deepest apologies
for disturbing you.

Hmm, it's all right.

Get your ass out here!
[gasps]

[sighs, moaning]

Millennials.

[continues moaning]

Oh, no way.

That's not coming with us.
She controls rats.

I know, I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

This is Sebastian.
Say hello, Sebastian.

I'm not shakin' the rat's hand.

[Sebastian whines]

And finally,
we have Abner Krill.

What's that 'round his neck?

A power dampener.

They call him
the Polka Dot Man.


What's he do,
throw polka dots at people?

He does.

He throws polka dots at people.

Hey, Polka Dot Man,

I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

You fucking pussy!
[laughing hysterically]

[chuckles]
These are soldiers?

We need to debrief.

[glass squeaking]


Corto Maltese

is a small island nation off
the coast of South America.

Over the past 100 years,

the country has been ruled
with an iron fist

by the Herrera family.

But, a week ago, this guy,

General Silvio Luna,
along with his right-hand man,

Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

took control of
the Corto Maltese government

in a violent military coup.

The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

Although the United States
did not condone

the excesses
of the Herrera regime,

they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

Luna, however,
is virulently anti-American.

So, you want us to kill Luna?

No.

This is Jotunheim.

A scientific
experimentation facility

containing something known only
as Project Starfish.

Our intelligence sources
tell us

that Starfish
is extraterrestrial in origin.

In the hands
of the Luna regime,

it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

Your mission
is to infiltrate Jotunheim

and destroy every trace
of Project Starfish.

How are we supposed to get in?

Gaius Grieves, the Thinker,

is a geneticist in charge
of Project Starfish.

After hours, he hangs out
at a gentlemen's club

known as La Gatita Amable.

Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

and he can get you
into Jotunheim.

Any questions?

What is that?

an overhead projector.

Do you ever use it anymore?

No, not really.

So, why don't you
just throw it away?


Starfish is a slang term
for a butthole.

Think there's any connection?

No.

No...

Nanaue.


Hand.

Yes, that is your hand,
Nanaue, very good.

We're all gonna die.

I hope so.

Oh, for fuck's sake.

[dramatic music playing]


Control, we have a disturbance
south of here.

[Waller on radio] <i>It's just
a diversion, Bloodsport.</i>

All right, we cut through the
jungle to get to Valle Del Mar.

Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

That's the word.

How we getting in? Especially
with Charlie the Tuna here.

How the hell am I
supposed to know?

You're the leader.

You're supposed to be decisive.

And I've decided
that you should eat

a big bag of dicks, how's that?

You're being facetious,
but if this whole beach

was completely covered in dicks

and somebody said I had to eat

every dick until the beach
was clean for liberty,

I would say no problemo.

Why would someone put penises
all over the beach?

Who knows why madmen
do what they do?

Well, you know what I think?

I think liberty
is just your excuse

to do whatever you want.

Whether that's to eat a beach
full of dicks or killin' folk.

Oh, yeah?

At least I don't kill men
for money like you.

Oh, here we go.

There's something wrong
with your skin.

It's just a rash.

That's a rash?




[gunfire]
[soldier shouts indistinctly]



are the only one...

fit to carry my javelin.

Carry it for...

[exhaling slowly]

[soft music playing]

Carry it for who?

For what? What the heck?

Who am I supposed
to carry it for?

[soldier shouts in Spanish]

[Harley, in English]
This is so frustratin'.

He just told me I have
to carry this javelin

for a reason,
but he didn't say why!

Waller? Waller. Waller!

[weapons cocking]

All right, we'll camp here,

and tomorrow we'll go
straight through to the city

to get to La Gatita Amable
by nightfall.



[animals croaking nearby]

[grunting softly]

[twigs snapping]
[groans]

[Polka Dot Man pants]








How deep of a sleeper are you?

I was having
the most wonderful dream.

If it was you about to be
eaten by King Shark,

then you're psychic.

[Ratcatcher 2] I don't believe
he would do that.

He has very kind eyes.



You bastard!

[rats squeaking]
[Peacemaker] Uh...

[King Shark grunting in fear]

All right,
calm down with the rats!

What?
I have a thing with rats.

You have a thing with rats?
Yes.

And you're on a team with me?
Not something I asked for!


What are you
laughing at me for, man?

Why the fuck are you
in your underwear?

Tighty-whities? Really?

Now, that's just racist.
[Bloodsport] No.

<i>It's not racist.</i>

<i>They're tighty-whities.</i>
[Emilia] Oh, come the fuck on.

Bloodsport's got a rat phobia.

What?
[laughs]

You didn't tell me

<i>you had a fear of rats, DuBois?</i>

I'm an assassin! Why would I
share my liabilities?



Aw. He's offering you
a pretty leaf

to show you he means no harm.

Why the fuck
would I want a leaf?


Just get the rats out of here!

Oh, fuck's sake.
Huh. Cool.

[King Shark pants]

Hey, we gonna kill
Megalodouche now, or what?

member of your team.</i>

You need him
to get into Jotunheim.

Yeah, well,
we can't function as a team

if we gotta watch our back

from one of our own
eatin' our bollocks.

Nanaue,
would you eat your friends?

I no friends.

You have no friends?

If you did, would you eat them?

Yes.


No?

Then, can we be your friends?


He's obviously lying.

If I die
'cause I gambled on love,

it will be a worthy death.

Friends.


You are a little idiot.

[footsteps departing]

[alarm beeps]
[coughs]

Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
I'm good at my job.


Check it out.

Look, right here, a mile north.

Task Force X,

you have an additional
mission directive.

<i>We've located
Colonel Rick Flag.</i>

<i>He's been taken by the enemy.</i>

Rick Flag?

<i>I know, you both served</i>

on special forces in Qurac
that took down Avral Kaddam.

<i>Flag was the one
who initially recommended you.</i>

operatives in Corto Maltese

and didn't tell us?

<i>There was no tactical
advantage, now there is.</i>

<i>I've uploaded the location
on your MTS.</i>

<i>Terminate his captors
with extreme prejudice.</i>

<i>Kill anyone you see.
These are dangerous people.</i>

<i>Recover Flag before moving on
to the city.</i>

[tense music playing]
[device beeping]

That's where
they're holding Flag.

Nothing like a bloodbath
to start the day.

They call you Peacemaker?

I cherish peace
with all my heart.

I don't care
how many men, women,

and children
I need to kill to get it.

you were the crazy one.

I am.


Let's get it.

Boss.

<i>Gracias.</i>

[tense music playing]
[soft footsteps pattering]

No, no, no! [screaming]

[squeaking]
[grunting]

[instrumental rock music
playing]






[tense music playing]

[men grunting]

[all grunting]

[dramatic music playing]

[woman singing in Spanish]



[Peacemaker blowing]
[grunts]


[man whimpering]

No, no, no!



[dramatic music playing]

[exclaims in Spanish]

[electricity crackling]
[groaning]

Hmm?

[grunts, groans]

Non-lethal.

You lose.

Exploding compression bullets.

[continues groaning]
[bullet whines]

No one likes a show-off.

Unless what they're
showing off is dope as fuck.

Fuck. That's true.

[dramatic music continues]


[all scream]

He does throw
polka dots at people.

I'm sorry it's so...
flamboyant.

It looks cool. I think.

I don't like to kill people,

but if I pretend
they're my mom, it's easy.

T.M.I., mate.



[Spanish song playing
on speaker]

DuBois?

Hey, Flag.

What the hell
are you doing here?

Waller told us that you were...

Uh...

Are you drinkin' tea?

This is Sol Soria,

she's the leader
of the freedom fighters,

the resistance trying to take
down the current government.

They saved my life.

Oh, wow.

Why did my people not alert me
of your arrival?

We didn't see any people.

Yeah, I didn't see
anybody on the way...

There's no one out there.

They were gone
when we got here.

I turned them into my mother
in my head and killed them.


[Sebastian squeaks]

[animals calling in distance]

[flies buzzing]

Typical Americans.
Just run in, guns blazing.

I know, this is messed up.

These guys, they're...
What's this one do?

They're fucking idiots,

but right now our objectives
align with yours.


If Jotunheim
contains the technology

our intelligence says it does,

then it could be used
on the people of Corto Maltese

as well as Americans.

That's why we need your help

to get into the city
so we can stop 'em.

Is that rat waving at me?

It appears it is.

Why?

I'm gonna guess
because it's friendly.

Luna and Suarez
murdered my entire family.

I'd make a deal
with the Devil to stop them.

Your people will have our help
getting to Valle Del Mar

to apprehend
this Gaius Grieves.

[dramatic music plays]

[projector whirring]

[door buzzes]

Hey.

What is this?
You slaughtered my staff!

They were loyal
to the Herreras.

Who are you loyal to, Thinker?

They call you "Thinker," yes?

All that shit in your face
is to make your brain good?

Yes, makes my brain good.

Are you being sarcastic
with me?

[swearing in Spanish]

Hey! Hey.

I shall do to you
as we did to your employees.

Hey. Mateo!

[speaks Spanish]

[in English] What is this?


It's been the primary focus
of my experiments here

for the past 30 years.

[Suarez speaking Spanish]

[in English] Here.
What... What is it doing here?


It is having little babies.


extensions of itself.

They take hosts,

and those hosts in turn become
part of the central being.

It feeds
on their consciousnesses.

Grows larger, more powerful.

So...


where is
this Project Starfish now?

[Suarez speaking Spanish]

[in English]
Marvelous idea, Presidente.

But as I've noted,

I've been working
with the beast for 30 years.

And there's no one but me
capable of controlling it.

Well, then...

welcome to the team.

[footsteps approach]

<i>Si,</i> Camila.


[speaking Spanish]

a big mistake

throwing me down here!

I will be outta here
soon enough

and I will kill
every last one of you,

Colto Maltese-tezios.
Maltese-els.

Malte-multoids. Colt-a-mults?

Whatever you <i>Mario Kart-racing</i>
d-bags are called!


Put this on.

[soft music playing]

Oh, wow.

I'm a princess.

[gasping in awe]

[soft music continues]

<i>Senorita</i> Quinn,

on behalf of the entire staff
of Our Honorable General

Presidente Silvio
Eleuterio Luna,

it's a pleasure to serve you.

<i>Gracias.</i>

My mother said
to count back again.

Ten, nine,

eight, seven, six,

five, four, three,

two, one. Ha!
Coronel, beat that...

[classical music
playing softly]

Oh.

Forgive my appearance,
<i>Senorita</i> Quinn.

I have admired you from afar

for many years now.

<i>Senorita.</i>

Me?

You're a hero to me,
as well as to my people.

I think you might
got me confused.

Harley Quinn's fire
and rebellion

in the face
of American oppression

is something to which
my entire country aspires.

Oh.

I have prepared lunch.

Would you be so kind
as to join me?

I'm so kind, sure.

[indie rock music playing]

<i>â™ª So if you're lonely â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why'd you say
You're not lonely? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, you're a silly girl â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I know I heard it so â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's just like you
To come and go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And know me... â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª No, you don't even know me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're so sweet to try
Oh, my, you caught my eye â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A girl like you's
Just irresistible â™ª</i>

[birds chirping]

<i>â™ª And so if you're lonely â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why'd you say
You're not lonely? â™ª</i>

[indie rock music continues
faintly on speaker]

You want me to what?

To marry me.

You're joshing.

Might I be frank, Harley?

You might be.

Good, listen.

Since I took control,
the majority love me.

But some find me to be

an unacceptable leader.

would find that?

Don't they know
how awesome you are?

Have you shown them
the birdies?

It may sound archaic

to someone
from your part of the world,

but my people,
the Corto Malteseans,

they're very old-fashioned.

Corto Malteseans, of course.

And I am a bachelor.

So they want
you to get hitched?

My people say you would
make the perfect wife.

Because, you know,

you symbolize
anti-American fervor.

Oh.

But I am a romantic, Harley.

I agreed to meet with you
just to appease them.

However, upon spending
the day with you,

I find myself hardly able
to think straight.

You are perfect in every...
You are so freaking hot.

[indie rock music resumes]

[Harley panting]

<i>â™ª So if you're lonely â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No, you don't even know me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're so sweet to try â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, my, you caught my eye â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A girl like you's
Just irresistible â™ª</i>

Harley Luna.

I like the ring of that.

That's Jotunheim?

Nazis came here seeking asylum
after World War II.

They built Jotunheim
to continue

their unorthodox experiments.

Until the Herrera family accepted
the bounty on the Nazis' heads

and killed them all.

Wowza.

Many years ago,
the rumors began of a beast.

These dark rumors helped the
Herrera family maintain power.

They would send
their political enemies

and their families
to the fortress,

never to return.

I have recently learned

these were not rumors.

They were murdering thousands

in bizarre experiments
with this creature.

Well, it must be a big relief

to got it
in your hands now, huh?


Now, it is our enemies
who shall be fearful.

If anyone dares
to say a negative word

about their
new president today,

their parents, their children,
and anyone they ever loved

will be sent to Jotunheim
to feed the beast.



Recently, I made
a promise to myself

that the next time
I got a boyfriend,

I'd be on the lookout
for red flags.

And if I saw any,

I would do the healthy thing

and I would murder him.

And killing kids?

Kind of a red flag.

[stifled groaning]

I know, I know.

I know what
you're tryin' to say.

"Harley, why not just leave?"

And I'd say,
"Why are you screaming at me?

"I'm not deaf.
I'm standing right here."

And then I'd say,

"When your taste in men
is as bad as mine,

they don't just
go away quietly.

"They slash your tires
and they kill your dogs and

tell you
that the music you like

ain't real music at all."

And all the cruelty...

[melancholy music playing]


...tears you apart
after a while.

You were real pretty and all,

and R.I.P. to that absolutely
beautiful monster

between your legs, but...

all in all...

I think you're
more pretty like this,

with all those rotten thoughts
emptied from your head.

I can't believe
this thing had a bullet.

[guards shouting in Spanish]

[in English]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

[eerie music plays]

are you doin'?

[Ratcatcher 2] We're tired,
Colonel. We need a rest.

Goddamn hobbyists.

We cannot stop.

We need to hurry if you're
going to help my people.

Hey. We're not here
to help your people.

But she's right,
we gotta keep moving.

I carry friend?


It's happening
to his face again.

It's nothing, I slipped.
Hey...

Norman Bates, if that shit's
contagious, we need to know.

It's not. [grunts]

[Peacemaker] What is it?
It's a...

It's an interdimensional virus.

Fuck is that?

My mother was a scientist
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

and she was obsessed
with turning me

and my brothers and sisters
into superheroes.

She infected me.

Now, if I don't, you know,
expel the dots twice a day...

Then what?

They'll eat me alive.
[chuckles dryly]

What happened
to your brothers and sisters?

[Polka Dot Man] Some lived.

Some...

died.

And your mom, where is she now?

[foreboding music playing]

Everywhere.


[Sol Soria] Come on,
we must hurry,

or we'll be late
to meet my contact.

That said, the walking <i>tiburon</i>

I wear disguise.

Oh, you're going
to wear a disguise.

<i>Si.</i>

Hey, he's learnin' Spanish.

And what kind of disguise?

Fake mustache.
Oh.

Yeah, fake mustache
isn't gonna cut it, mate.

There's gonna be a lot of
soldiers watching Jotunheim.

If they discover us there...

Let's pray they do not,
or you will all be dead.

If they do,

that'll leave
the palace vulnerable.

Luna and the other generals

will be left
without protection.

You're a good man,
Colonel Flag.

You still look
exactly like yourself.

That's the worst fake
mustache I've ever seen.

And if you had fooled us,
we'd have to kill you,

shark-shaped bloke

creeping up on us like that.

Fuck! [grunts]

You, you.

[Ratcatcher 2] Aw.

He always wants to be near you.

I think he senses good in you.

Yeah, there's no good in me.

Damn.

Supposed to play golf with

I'm gonna look a fool.
[indistinct radio chatter]

[Bloodsport on radio]
<i>Waller, come in.</i>

Ugh.

You missed.

We're losing connection.

Fuck's sake.

[Waller] <i>Task Force X.</i>
Waller.

<i>You there?</i>

<i>The military must have put</i>

Your comms are down,

not to mention what will
happen to your daughter.

So, no funny business.

<i>Do you copy, DuBois?</i>

Copy.


Hey, uh, all that stuff
about his daughter,

you wouldn't
really do that, right?

You don't know half
of what I would do, John.

[Spanish song continues
playing on speaker]

What?

Why are you so afraid of rats?


Why are you so in love
with them, Ratcatcher 2?

You know what I think?

I think you have a serious
case of daddy issues.

I have no issues with
how much I loved my father.

Although he was a genius...

we lived homeless in the streets
of Portugal 'cause of his...

burdens.

He built the machines
I employ today...


...and taught me the secrets
of calling the rats.

[rats squeaking]

They brought us
trinkets to live on.

And they kept us warm at night,

when we would have frozen.

But eventually...
[young Cleo] <i>Papa.</i>

<i>Papa, wake up.</i>

...my father's burdens

became too heavy to carry.

[young Cleo] <i>No.</i>

<i>No, Papa.</i>

And he was gone.
<i>Papa, wake up.</i>

I took his machinery
and came to America.

That is the dream, right?

But I was arrested

for armed bank robbery,
do you believe it?

The state considered
the rats a weapon.

What?

You remind me of my daughter,

the reason I'm here.

Why are you so afraid of rats?

My old man.

When I was a lad,

if I didn't finish
a task right,

he would dole out
the punishment.

And one day, he just locked me
in a crate for 24 hours.

And it was
full of starvin' rats.

As imperfect my father was...

he loved me.

I wish I could
give that to you.

Don't you worry, yeah?

I'm gonna get you
out of here alive.

I'm going to get you
out of here alive.

How about a round of Fernets

Just one.

Yup.

Well, if we can't,

Be quiet, please.

You are perceivably panicked.

I'm guessing that you are not

your deranged compatriot,
Harley Quinn.

Is Harley alive?


Mayor General Suarez
can be rather harsh

when extracting information.

<i>Dim mak.</i>

[speaks Spanish]

[in English] That's
the Cantonese term for it.

In Japan, it's <i>kyoshu jitsu.</i>

In English,
it's simply the Death Touch,

how to kill a man
with a single blow.

Of course it's possible

to kill a man
with a single blow.

But it's a matter of chance,

and cannot be wielded
with certainty.

That's what they say.
They?

Amateurs.
On one?

One.



I don't smoke.

<i>â™ª I ain't got nobody â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Nobody cares for me
No... â™ª</i>


[chuckles lightly]

I will ask again.

How many meta-power teammates

arrived with you

Sixty-nine.

Sixty-nine?

How could you get
69 troops into the...

[tires screech]

You gotta be kiddin' me.

You're gonna risk
the entire mission

for a mental defective
dressed as a court jester.

This coming from a guy that
wears a toilet seat on his head.

We don't leave
one of our own behind.

You're okay with this?

No, but I've been around Flag
when he's got a rag in his mouth.

Best not to tug it.
Motherfucker!

Hey, wake up, wake up.

All right, let's go.

[dramatic music continues]

All right, we'll enter
through the third floor,

go to the inner staircase,
and then down to the cellar

where they usually
keep their detainees.

Hopefully,
Harley's still alive.

It's not a toilet seat,
it's a beacon of freedom!

Colonel, I got a clean shot
on the only one in the office.

Just give the word.

Fire on three, two...

What are you guys doing?

I... You.
We're here to save you.

You were gonna... save me?

It was a really good plan, too.

Well, I can go back inside,
and you can still do it.

That's patronizing.

Yeah, no, it's not...

what's with the javelin?

I'm waitin' for God to tell me.

[Bloodsport] Jesus Christ.
[Harley] Yeah.

Or Him. Or any of them, really.


Okay.

all right, yeah?

I'm so sorry.
That's all right.

Harley Quinn.

Bloodsport.

all the fucking empanadas?

Mine were very good.

I had the chicken.


here's the deal.
We fail the mission, you die.

We find out any information
you give us is false, you die.

If we find out you have personalized
license plates, you die.

What? No.

If you mismatch blacks,
you die.

No.

If you cough without
covering your mouth...

Harley. Those last three
aren't things.

Although, probably
don't need to say this,

but that isn't
an open invitation

for you to cough
without covering your mouth.

All right, we're gonna need
you to drive the minibus,

with all of us inside, past
the guards at the front gate.

Once through the gate, we'll use you
to get through the retinal scanner.

There are security cameras
everywhere.

They're being dealt with.

We'll neutralize the soldiers
there and enter.

Once we're inside,
we separate into teams.

I am walking back and forth.

Okay. You're gonna lead me and
Ratcatcher 2 to Project Starfish.

I'm going with you
'cause I don't trust this guy.

you're coming with me.

Our munitions expertise are
needed to place the explosives,

starting at the first floor,
going all the way to the top.

Once we're clear, we blow
the tits off that thing,

and go home.

This is suicide.

Well, that's kind of our thing.

Yeah.

Thirty years he's kept me here.

I call it Starro the Conqueror.

That's meant to be derisive.

Sorry, old chum.

These two are here to kill you.

It's out of my hands.

We need to help these people.

Impossible, dear. They're
corpses below those stars.

Who are they?


The fodder of powerful men
through every age.

Dissidents,

journalists,

political rivals,

and their loved ones.

Oh, please,

unclutch your fucking pearls,
Flag.

We serve the same master.

We were sent here to stop you.

Child,

your government
didn't send you here

to protect the world
from alien technology.

Your government sent you here
to cover up their part in it.

You're a goddamn liar.

American goddamn astronauts
found Starro.

<i>Yankee-fucking-doodle dandies.</i>

Although the Cold War
was ended,

your government
saw the potential

in weaponizing
such a powerful beast,

but banish the thought

of any such experiments
being held on American soil.

Your people
have always been squeamish

about the sacrifices necessary

for scientific advancement.

So,

the United States
made a secret deal

with the Corto Maltese
government

to conduct
their illegal experiments here

<i>in Jotunheim.</i>

<i>And they hired me
to oversee them.</i>

And now, because of

a run-of-the-mill
fucking military coup,

they're gonna destroy
30 years' worth of efforts.


You're the real victim here.

The hell you doing here? You're supposed
to be upstairs plantin' explosives.

I told you I didn't trust him.

Your records are located
in those computers?

Colonel, what are you doing?

I joined the military
to serve my country,

not to be its puppet.

What are you doing?

Who are you going
to show that to?

The press. Goddamn people
deserve to know.

I'm tired of coverin' up
their dirty little secrets.

This time these sons of bitches
are gonna be held account...

[gun cocks]

I can't let you do that,
Colonel.

Excuse me?
I'm truly sorry.

Miss Waller charged me
with makin' sure

those records
don't leave this building.

Of course, I shoulda known.

Waller's always got a backup.

Come on, man,
this isn't personal.

Holdin' a gun on me
is pretty fucking personal.

[muffled explosion]

What is that?

I'm gonna need that drive,
Colonel.

[muffled rumbling]

Those morons set off
the explosives too early.

Hand over the drive!

Let's go, come on!

an international incident!

Keepin' the peace
is worth any price,

including the life
of a hero like yours, sir,

so please...

don't make me do this.

[all gasp]

[Sebastian squeaking]

[grunts weakly]


[breathing laboriously]


What have you people done?



[choking and grunting]


Sebastian, come!

[crashing nearby]

[gasping]
[sinister music playing]

[Sebastian squeaking]

Okay, we gotta calm down.

Let's all just...
Let's talk about this.

I understand
where you're coming from.

I crossed a line.

Okay, I crossed a line!

I realize that,
but I'm ready to change.

I am ready to change.

And I didn't
mean to hurt you...



[gurgling and grunting]

[pained grunting]

[pants weakly]

[both grunt]

[both grunting]


[dramatic music playing]


[grunts heavily]

[both grunting]

[both groaning and panting]

You motherfucker.





[melancholy music playing]

[groans weakly]
[heartbeat slowing]

Peacemaker.

What a joke.

[melancholy music continues]

Cleo.

Give me back the drive.

[dramatic music playing]

[breathing heavily]

[both grunt]

I told you that information
can't get out. Fuck!

So, okay, okay,
destroy the hard drive.

Why kill me?
[Sebastian squeaking]

[breathing heavily]

Because I'm thorough.

[squeaking]
Oh, my...

Sorry, kid.


[Suarez shouting orders
in Spanish]

All right, troops are coming.

This floor, and then
nine floors left. Let's go!

Come on!
[device beeping]

[gentle music playing]

[gentle music continues]

[gentle music continues]

New dumb friends.


[continues guffawing]

[dramatic music playing]

Aw, fizzle sticks. Hold on.


[all groan]

[breathes rapidly]

Has anyone got eyes
or ears on any more?

They killed Milton!

Milton was still with us?

Where'd you think he was?
[Bloodsport] I don't know.

I thought he stayed back
with the bus.

What was Milton gonna do?

He was helping us!

Who's Milton?
What?

I don't remember any Milton.

Fuck! He has been with us
the whole time.

Somebody named Milton has
been with us the whole time?

Yes!

I don't think so.
I think I would've noticed

if a guy named Milton's
been with us.

It's not a very common name.

I don't think
I've ever even met Milton.

Are you messing around
right now?

He was a really nice guy,

and he sacrificed himself
to help us.

And now look at him.

He's dead.

Oh, that guy!
Milton, Milton. [chuckles]

So, when did this great
love affair with Milton start?

I liked him
from the beginning, okay?

I just didn't say
anything until...


No!

Oh.

Sorry, kid.


[dramatic music playing]



[breathes heavily]



How? [coughs]

Smaller bullets.

[stifled gasping]

He killed Colonel Flag.

He wanted to share this
with the press.

It's proof
the American government

was behind Project Starfish
the whole time.

[Ratcatcher 2 sobbing softly]

[tense music playing]
[distant chattering]

[soldiers shout in Spanish]

[Polka Dot Man] Whoa. Whoa.

[muffled thudding]

I think it's trying to get out.

What?

Whoa.

Whoa.
What the fuck is that?



Oh, shit, there's...

[tense music playing]

[person grunts]

This city is mine.



[all moaning]

[electrical whining
and buzzing]

Uh, Miss Waller,
I think the feed is back up.

[roaring on speaker]

Oh, my God, Miss Waller!

We've got a freaking <i>kaiju</i>
up in this shit!

[indistinct shouting]
[dramatic rock music playing]

[man screams]

[Waller over radio]
<i>Task force X, come in.</i>

<i>Are you there?</i>

Uh-huh.

<i>Whatever signal jammers</i>

were blocking
our communications

must have been in the building
you just demolished.

Yeah, well, we've got a mite
issue over here, Waller.

It's Project Starfish,
Miss Waller.

It's headed towards the city,
and I think it wants

to feed on as many people
as it can.

[people screaming]


<i>If you've destroyed Jotunheim
and the records within,</i>

<i>you've achieved the objective.</i>

<i>Corto Maltese
is no longer a U.S. ally.</i>

If anything,
the White House will consider

fomenting disruption
in a hostile nation

a positive development.

[people screaming]

[creatures chittering]

[all grunting]

[tires screeching]

You heard what she said.

[people continue screaming
in distance]

Fuck.

[dramatic music plays]

[alarm wails]

Bloodsport is off mission.

What the...

She'll kill you, you know.

That's her business.

I knew Sebastian sensed good
in you for a reason.

Just keep that fucking rat
away from me.

Ratcatcher is also off mission.

Bloodsport, Ratcatcher,

<i>turn around.</i>

Where go, friends?


I know what I'm carrying
the javelin for.

[alarms wailing]

Krill, turn around now!

<i>Turn back now, God damn it!</i>

Open it.
Miss Waller...

Open it!

What are you doing,
Task Force X?

[inspirational music playing]

Fuck!
[device beeping]

Turn around now, God damn it!

<i>You dumb pieces of shit!</i>

<i>Motherfuckers!</i>


<i>God damn it, Task Force X,
this is your last</i>

motherfucking warning!

[beeping continues]

[grunts]
[John squeals]

Oh, my God!
What the fuck did you do?

All those people, John.

Little kids.

[Dale gasping]

Task Force X, the creature
is headed to Calle Principal.

Avoid Avenida Medrano.

There is a swarm of infected.
[John] Jesus.

So, your clearest path
is Calle Aguero.

Get on the satellite, Dale,
you fucking dickhead!

Yes, ma'am.

[panicked shouting]

[instrumental rock music
playing]

[people screaming]





Huh?

Harley, take the high ground!

[instrumental rock music
continues]

[Harley grunts]

Nanaue! Monster is nom nom!

Monster nom nom?

Yes!


[pained roaring]

Abner, do you see who that is?

[breathing rapidly] Huh?

It's your mom!


[pained roaring]

[all yelling in pain]

I'm a superhero!

I'm a motherfucking super...

[high-pitched roaring]



[stirring rock music playing]


God!

[slow, somber music playing]

<i>No! No!</i>


Oh, no...

This city

is mine!

This city isn't yours.

This city isn't ours.

This city is theirs.

[inspirational rock music
playing]

Oh, hell.

[rats squeaking]

[Bloodsport whimpering]


[inspirational rock music
continues]

[high-pitched roaring]





Why rats, Papa?

Rats are the lowliest
and most despised

of all creatures, my love.

If they have purpose,

so do we all.

[inspirational rock music
continues]

[continues sobbing]


[inspirational rock music
playing]

[gasping rapidly]

[roaring weakly]

I was happy,

floating, staring at the stars.

[rats squeaking]

[reporter on tv]
<i>A group of escaped convicts</i>

<i>saved a city of millions</i>

<i>on the small island nation
of Corto Maltese today.</i>

That's my dad.

[Sol Soria]
<i>Because of these people,</i>

<i>Corto Maltese will have
free democratic elections</i>

<i>for the first time in 90 years.</i>

[fighters chanting]
<i>Viva Corto Maltese!</i>

<i>Viva Corto Maltese!</i>

<i>Viva Corto Maltese! Viva...</i>

That's my dad.
<i>...Corto Maltese! Viva...</i>

[pensive music playing]

[sobs softly]


Yeah.

<i>Oh, that's just a taste
of what's on that drive.</i>

<i>I've uploaded it all
to a secure server.</i>

<i>Now, if you kill any one of us,</i>

or my daughter ever sees
the inside of a prison,

it goes public.

If we all go free,

it never has to see
the light of day.

I told you I'd make you
a leader, DuBois.

<i>You got a deal.</i>

[King Shark grunts]

Nanaue.


[soft music playing]

Look, I know Flag wanted to
give the drive to the press,

but we just saved
a whole bloody city.

We can't have it all.

Flag was my friend.

Mine too.

And I haven't got
many of those.

I could be your friend, Milton.

Not my name.

What?

What are you talkin' about?
We just had a conversation

for, like, three hours
about how your name is Milton.

Didn't.


No. Our ride's here.

Hmm.
[helicopter whirring]

Nom nom?

Really?

That is what you're
thinkin' about right now?

No. That nom nom though.

[Ratcatcher 2]
No, it's not nom nom.

No!

Said they found him
in the rubble.

They were shocked
his heart was still beating.

I wasn't certain
how safe it was,

shipping him back here.

But, if anything,
he's shown he's resilient.

It'll take some surgery,

but eventually we'll get him
back up to speed.

You realize
this is revenge, right?

Waller knows
we double-crossed her,

and she's getting back at us

by saddling us
with this douchebag.

Yep.

I heard he was sort of a hero
down in Corto Maltese.

Oh, is that what you heard?
Because not quite.

[Dr. Alandy] What do you guys
want him for?

Just to save
the fucking world, that's all.
