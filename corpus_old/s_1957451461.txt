MAN: Back in five,

we are streaming live
from Bubble HQ.

GUEST 1: It's launch day
at Bubble.

GUEST 2: What incredible tech
are they about to unveil?

GUEST 3: We're going in.

(GUESTS CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)

MAN 2: <i>Have you ever felt
completely alone?</i>

Standing on the edge
of things, so awkward,

not daring to approach anyone?

What if you could have
one perfect friend

who thinks you're awesome,
who can help you find friends

and make it all easy?

FEMALE VOICE: <i>All staff
to the launchitorium.</i>

MAN: (ON SPEAKER)
<i>Marc, they're ready.</i>

<i>Marc?</i>

So, this is it. (CHUCKLES)

This is finally it!

The day that we at Bubble

give the whole world
a new best friend!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

ALL: (CHANTING)
Marc! Marc! Marc!

Aw! (CHUCKLES)
We did this together, guys!

This is what
it's all been for.

Right back to the time
in the garage

where Bubble started.

My garage, folks. My garage.

Of course, yes, Andrew.

Thanks. Uh...

But today,

we take a huge leap

from Bubble's phones
and tablets and watches

to a whole new world
of connection.

And at its heart, my code.

My algorithm for friendship.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

The code that drives
your new best friend,

the Bubble Bot.
(APPLAUSE)

FEMALE VOICE: <i>Welcome
to the future of friendship.</i>

MARC: You wanna meet it? Okay!

Me! Me!
Me, me! Over here!

Pick me! Please!

MARC: Do we have an "EllieB9"?

Oh, my gosh!
That's me, that's me!

Hi.

Hi. So, that's your posts,

I just need to go...

I forgot my, uh, inhaler.

The other one. (FAKE-COUGHS)

Got it. You need to sit down.
Huh?

(STUDENTS

This is gonna work, Barney.
You'll see.

It really won't.
Yes, it will.

It kind of makes things

Bring it in, brave soldier.

Whoa... What?

(BARNEY GASPS)
(GRUNTS)

Oh, ho ho!
Bring it in, Barney.

Come on, Barney boy.

Bring it in.

BARNEY: <i>Wow.
How low can a kid go?</i>

Now, when someone comes along,
talk to them about a hobby.

Didn't you write me an essay
on rock collecting?

Yeah. No.

Will you go talk to Barney?
He loves rocks.

He needs friends.
It's his birthday.

BARNEY: <i>Kill me now.</i>

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

Happy birthday!

Ha-ha. Miss Thomas said
you wanna talk about rocks?

Who likes rocks?

So, you're into rocks?

Uh...
(RICH LAUGHS)

Seriously?
Dude, it's your birthday

and you still didn't get
a B-Bot? (LAUGHS)

Maybe he doesn't want a B-Bot.

(BOYS LAUGHING)
Maybe he prefers rocks.

Hey. You're a rock star,
Barney.

BOT: Oh, snap.
Ha-ha! You get it?

(BARNEY GROANS)

Who's your favorite

It's my birthday,

MAN: Sorry, are we
on the line? Is that...

Yes, hello!

So, today, Mr. Takahashi,

Pudowski Novelty

this highly amusing novelty,

the Brother Bouncy car monk.

He wiggles, he bounces,

he's got...
MR. TAKAHASHI: <i>Uh... No.</i>

He'll hold your phone.
<i>Uh...</i>

Oh, hi, Barney. Good day?

Uh...

Mr. Takahashi?

BARNEY: Thanks, Gran! Ow!

Oops! (CHUCKLES)

And our own goat wool.

And from me...

BARNEY: <i>Could it be?</i>
GRAHAM: Wait for it.

BARNEY: <i>Is there
any possible way?</i>

(SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

Wow. Rock hammers.

You always
did love your rocks.

Yeah, I did. Always. Used to.

Thanks, Dad.

I just... The goats' wool
and my allergies.

Oh, no, no, no.

No one in Pudowski family
have allergy.

What about Uncle Boris?

He was possessed.
By a demon in a cashew.

I don't know, Mom.

What time your friends come,
Barney?

I cook all day.
BARNEY: Wow!

This real food.

Yum! Schkembe! (SLURPS)

Bet your friends
never had tripe soup before.

Ooh! I put on Zany Bogomil!

(KIDS SCREAMING)


Um, actually, the thing is...

No one's coming to the party.

No one?

Huh?

You ask and all say no?

Son, (SIGHS) we're
a little worried about you.

You... You never go out with
anyone or have friends over.

You know,
that's why we thought

invite the whole class!

Get the whole gang
over here, right?

You know. Get you in the swing
of things with everybody.

I make food
for all your buddies.

BARNEY: I don't really have...

You know, they probably
just didn't read the invites.

No one does paper these days.
They send messages

with their B-Bots.

Really? You need a B-Bot

to have a social life
these days?

Eh, pfft!
Yeah, Dad, kind of.

No. I don't want you addicted
to some device.

You should be out there
in the woods.

Kicking around with a buddy.

Get out there, Barn. Interact.

You don't wanna spend
your whole life

glued to a... (MUMBLES)
(PHONE CHIMING CONTINUOUSLY)

B-Bots.
What?

It just a craze

and they cost a fortune.
Mm-hmm.

Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
It's... it's a waste of money.

No big deal.

(DOORBELL DINGS)
MAN: Bubble delivery.


What? It can't be!

Dad, you were kidding me!
(MUMBLES)

I knew you wouldn't just give
me rock hammers. I knew it!

Oh. A rock.

(UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

BOTS: (SINGING)
<i>â™ª We will, we will rock you â™ª</i>

(BOYS LAUGHING)

Yo, I got
the whole thing, bro.

It was hilarious, Barn.
You thought it was a B-Bot.

A B-Bot?

Let it go, Rich.

You get out of here.

You want I pour hot chicken
fat down your pants!

Barney, what's going on?

It's okay, Dad. Really.

These are great.

It's what he really wanted.

If his mom were alive,
she'd have known that.

Maybe just the basic model?

No, no, no.

Hang on, please.
Please, please.

I throw in goat.
Goat for a B-Bot.

She real friend.

And when you get bored
of this one,

Less waste, good for planet.
Yeah.

DONKA: What?

No. No, no, no. Come on.

What is this?

I am not afraid of you,

MAN 1: What do you got

MAN 2: We got five pads

MAN 1: Yeah?
What about that one?

MAN 2: Uh, that one fell out
of my van earlier.

GRAHAM: Happy late birthday,

Wha... Dad! Oh, Dad!

You got me one!

I taught it.
I paid for that.

It was just doing what I said.

Take it away! It's crazy!

BOT: At least
I'm not Uncle Boris.

I'm... I'm sure
it's just a minor issue.

It's violent, uncontrollable,
and highly dangerous.

Okay, great.
Let me look into that.

No. There's nothing wrong
with him.

It assaulted a child!

It didn't assault him.

I hit Rich Belcher.
It was awesome, but terrible,

Bah, he had it coming.

You can't just take it.
It's mine!

Yes, you do! It's Absalom.

Hi, Absalom.
What?

According to our records,
it has no registered owner.

But I give all my funeral money...
Mom...

...to that man in the alley.
...please.

You got it
from a man in an alley?

Did you obtain
this bot illegally?

What?
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

This took a turn,

Send it to the crusher!

What?
For all we know,

it could kill someone.
(BOT DINGS)

No. It's mine.
It was my birthday present.

We'll return it to the

Do you want me to close
the whole store?

Uh, one crushing coming up!

Use the recycler.

<i>Adios,</i> Absalom.

<i>Arrivederci. Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

No, you can't do that.

Dad, please.
It was sticking up for me.

Barney, we gotta let it go.

Let's take some details.

What was your name, sir?
Uh...

Absalom, will crushing be fun?




Phew.

Hi, Absalom.
Shh.

Happy birthday!
What are you doing?

A friend must stay

We'll go

No! Crushing is not fun!
It means smushed, flattened...

But you get

And you don't choose me.


I do, okay. I choose you.

I can fix you, like Gran said,

Okay, Absalom.

Okay.

My registered name is Absalom,

One hundred

Whoo! Yeah!

Well, we made
100 million new friends,

all helping kids connect,
meet each other,

interact.
And all through their B-Bots.

Making friends face-to-face?

So last three millennia.


Some kids check in
with their bots

a hundred times a day,
plus 11 times overnight.

We've finally done it.
We've ended sleep.

Uh, the algorithm
may need adjusting.

ANDREW: Think of the data
we can harvest!

No, no, no. I designed them...

In my garage.
...for making friends.

Into dollars.

If our share price
goes any higher,

we'll have to give it
a space suit. (SLURPS DRINK)

So what about the B-Bot
that punched a child?

(CAMERA CLICKING)

It hit a cop?

<i>And a child.</i>

It hit a cop.
We can't put that on the box.

No, no. B-Bots are incapable
of violence.

My algorithm

I better look into that.
You think?

I mean, what if someone

I, for one, could not live

with what that would do
to our share price.

Good! Uh...

Because if that

How to be my friend.

A bunch of your code

So, I'm gonna teach you

And then
you can come to school.

What is a friend, Barney?

Well, a friend
is a person who, uh,

likes, uh...

Is always... I...

A person who, uh, "likes,
is always, I."

Okay.
Now I'm your best friend.


No, no, no. There's a lot more
than that, Ron.

You have to know
everything about me.

You have to like me,
obviously.

Like all the same stuff as me,
and you have to be on my side.

But don't hit people.
Even Rich Belcher.

Hair, brown. Height, 4'11".

5'11" would be better.
You could reach high objects.

Hey. (CHUCKLES) A friend likes
everything about you.

What?
Let's go to school.

I am not to stay

Yes.

Bad day. Always six feet.


BARNEY: Allergies.
Goats, wool. Goats' wool.

I'm basically
allergic to life.

That's why I like rocks.

That is sad and also tragic.

Electricity?

Electricity is better
than rocks.

Ron, what are you...


(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

Whoo-hoo-hoo! You got it!
You got the six feet!

Hey! No, no, no. That's...

(RON DINGS)

You know, I'm... I'm not

That would mean
they know I exist.

RON: Perhaps you don't.
Hey!

RON: List relations.

Dad, Donka,

Donka says, actually,
one was possessed,

but I think it might
have been a nut allergy.

(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

There was Mom, too, of course.

But, uh,
she died when I was two.

And Dad moved us out here.

It doesn't make me sad exactly
'cause I... I can't remember.

But it did make
things hard for Dad.

She was returned

Uh...

Barney, your B-Bot is,

GIRL: Yeah.
SAVANNAH: And naked?

And hold on a sec.
Why hasn't it friended me?

Would you like to friend
@theSavannahMeads?

BARNEY: No. He can't do
any of that stuff.

He can't make friends or...
He's useless at all that.

(GASPS) Can't make friends?
GIRL: What?

Barney,
don't say your weirdness

has rubbed off on him.

Making friends is, like,
what he's for.

If he can't do that, he's,
like, literally pointless.

Like, a lump of plastic
just following you around.

Hashtag landfill.

I am for making friends?
BARNEY: Ron...

How do I make friends
for Barney?

BARNEY: Come. (SCREAMS)

Seriously?
Ugh.

You share stuff about him.

Like pictures of his food
or his wake-up routine.

You search
for people who know him

or like the same stuff as him.

You show them pictures,
and then you get comments,

and then you get
people that like him,

and then you get
friend invites.

Boom! Now he has friends.
Duh!

Ron! We have to go!

Does Barney need friends?

Well, yeah! Or, fun fact,

he will not survive
middle school.

Savannah,
please don't tell anyone.

I'm not supposed to have him.
He has to be a secret.

That's impossible.
So, I don't believe you.

Um, yeah, but...
Then the kid.

I want everything. Contacts,
shopping habits, shoe-size.

You mean his private data?

Sure.
Why else do we collect it?

We've got nothing on him.
He hasn't friended anyone.

He doesn't blog, post,
or share.

Creepy.

MARC: Uploading the patch now!

(BOTS POWERING DOWN)



That's the patch.

Just in time.
Good thing nobody saw it.

You just killed Bubble, Marc.

Spread out. Find the rogue.

How can I put this gently?
Get out!

(BARNEY SIGHS)

Hi, Barney.
(BARNEY GROANS)

We have 43 new friends.

Maybe you do.
But I've been kicked out.


(DOOR OPENS)
MAN: This way.

Ugh!

(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

How could you? You dumb bot!

I'm in so much trouble now.

All you had to
do was just fit in.

What was the point of even...?

RON: Barney,
are you my friend?

What?

What do you mean?

My dad bought you for me.

What's that?

Where are you going?

Friendship is
a two-way street.

What?
RON: I get to choose.

(TIRES SCREECH)
You taught me.

BARNEY: I didn't say
be more than six feet.

RON: But you are
having a bad day.

You know what? I don't care.
Fine! Go on then.

RON: I am going.
Uh-huh.

RON: Okay.
Okay. I'll...

RON: Okay.
Okay!



RON: <i>Adios,</i>
registered-name-Absalom.

<i>Adios,</i> Absalom's B-Bot.

(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

STACEY: It's trending
in 13 countries!

CRAIG: They've searched
the school, Marc.

They didn't find it.

BOT: Bubble shares
are crashing. Down 43%.

We've got thousands of parents
complaining about B-Bot safety.

We've got thousands of kids complaining
their bots won't do the same stuff!

Marc, what do we do?

I... Uh, I've...

ANDREW: I wonder.

(SLURPING LOUDLY)

Maybe being a guy who makes
his friends out of skateboards

doesn't equip you to run
a global tech giant.

(SKATEBOARD CLATTERING)
Mm!

Okay. Here's our story.

We blame everything
on the rogue.

A single unit with
a minor coding error.

Minor? But the riot.

What riot?
We hose down the Internet.

Delete every video.
Take down every post.

Any TV station broadcasts it,

we buy the station and
replace it with cat videos,

then we sue the kids
for misuse of product

unless they sign
a binding yada, yada,

and send the principal
a fruit basket.

But what does
the genius think?

Andrew, you do this.

Sweet justice pie.

Hey, run off back to your lab

and invent something
that doesn't kill us all.

And, uh, you got an algorithm
for refilling this?

We got an address
from the school.

Pudowski. Oak Hill Drive.

Bing bong belushi!

Go!

Huh? (SIGHS)

GRAHAM: No. But Barney
doesn't even have a B-Bot.

BREE: All the kids at school
confirm he does, Mr. Pudowski.

He started a riot.

I'm sorry, are you calling
my son a liar?

DONKA: Oh, Barney.

<i>"Stay within six feet of me."</i>

<i>"Like me."</i>


(PLASTIC SQUEAKING)
Huh?


What are you doing?

Returning myself
to the facility.

I am a dumb bot.

No! No, you're not.
I'm so sorry.


We did not fix me.
I did not fit in.

Who cares? Neither do I.

It doesn't matter.
'Cause you are my friend.

(SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

Your best friend
out of the box?


(UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYING)


But still don't burn
my underpants. (CHUCKLES)

GRAHAM: You know, I have been
worried about him, but, uh,

I just... I work
these crazy hours.

BREE: The bot's in there?

Okay. This thing is dangerous.

We need to destroy it.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Let's run.
GRAHAM: Barney,

are you in there?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Just you and me.

GRAHAM: Mom,

We don't need anyone else.

Hey, you're not in trouble.
Please, just let me in.

We need to go faster!

No problem!

Ron, you did it! Yes!

(GASPS, YELLS)

Hey, down here!

We just want the bot!


Quick! (YELPS)

RON: Shh.

Hey, miss. You seen
a boy and a bot?

Do I look like I care?

Okay, sorry. My bad.

What's going on?

Bubble are looking for Ron.

They blame him for the riot.
I have to protect him.

MAN: Hey, dude.
I think that was Poop Girl.

(MAN LAUGHS)

(SAVANNAH SOBS)
Savannah?

"Poop Girl" has
20 million and 56...

Poop Girl. That's...

That's who I'm gonna be

BARNEY: No.

MAN 2: You sure
he's not back there?

We gotta go.
Wait.

You're running away?
To the woods?

Please don't tell
anyone this time.

There are evil clowns
in there, Barney.

Their heads go
all the way around.

That's owls,
Savannah. I promise!

(BARNEY WHOOPING AND LAUGHING)

You lost them? No, no, no.
This is not happening.

You know what?

Access the cameras
on every B-Bot in town.

Use B-Bots to spy?

No. We're just recording for
training and monitoring purposes.

But Marc would never...
Marc put a camera

within six feet of every
young consumer in the country.

And now you're
worried about privacy?

Turn on the mics, too.

Listen out for
"Barney," "Rogue Bot,"

"Profit-sucking plastic
psycho." That kind of thing.

We'll find him. Wherever he is
in that Podunk town!

Huh?

(SCREAMS)

Come back

RON: Please help.

Oh, wow, you're sinking.

Hey, Ron.

Tell me something about you.
I never asked.

I am a Bubble

I currently have one friend.

Oh, wow. I found it.

You wanna share?

(CHOMPING)

You have not shared
29 friend invites.

Yeah. I know.

If you don't ask,
they can't say no.

Problem solved.

(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

You know who I had at my party
when I was six?

Savannah and Rich. For real.

They were my friends just
because they lived nearby.

But at some point you just...
You just get it...

that you're not gonna be
one of the cool kids.

Hey, who cares, right?

'Cause I currently have
one friend, too. (CHUCKLES)

How long will we
live in the woods?

I don't know. (CHUCKLES)

Forever?

(BARNEY CHUCKLES)


Do you know any stories, Ron?

I can create one

It will be called

"The Awesome Adventures

Once upon a time

Sure, Andrew.

They're just code. A trick.

What?

Data-harvesting
units controlled by us.

Designed to give kids
a consumer experience

featuring products and services
tailored to their browsing profile.

The B-Bots know
everything about them.

So we can sell them stuff.

You're spying on kids?

I hate kids.

Uh, Andrew. There's someone
inside the cloud.

What? It's him, isn't it?

Power down the cloud.
GRAHAM: No!

DONKA: No.
And send in security.

Ron!

Are you even here?

(BARNEY PANTING)

Oh, no. Where are you?
Barney Pudowski.

(SYSTEM BUZZES)
Um, seventh grade.

(BUZZES)
(SIGHS)

Nonsuch Middle School.


Uh... What is this?

FEMALE VOICE: <i>Powering down.</i>

What's happening?
<i>System at 10%.</i>

No. No, no, no.
<i>5%.</i>

<i>2%.</i>

No!


(VOICE QUIVERING)
Ron, I'll never find you.

And you'll never find me.

Find me.

Find me!


Please.


(SOFT BUZZING)

(SOFT UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYING)


Ron, I'm coming!



Ron!

Come on, come on!

Yes! I'm in.

Barney! (CHUCKLES) He made it.

I found you!
I did it! I found you!

Uh, desk, desk.

Oh! (CHUCKLES) Okay. Uh...

Here we go.


(CHUCKLES)
Hi, Absalom?

Ron, it's you!

Now I know
what's wrong with him.

Ron never had my algorithm.

Whoa!

That's his code?

It's beautiful. Like...

Alive.

(GASPS)
(SIREN BLARING)

(BOTH LAUGHING)
(SINGING) <i>â™ª Dikky, dikky, dakka â™ª</i>

Hey, Ron. They turned you
into electricity...

<i>â™ª Dikky, dikky, dikky, dakka
Dikky, dikky, dakka â™ª</i>

...and then put
you inside a rock.

Electricity is best.

BOTH: You are so annoying!
BARNEY: Whoa, whoa...

Please slap my hand
to show we are bonding.

(LAUGHS)
I am within six feet.

Okay. Then just stay that way,
all right?

'Cause we gotta get out
of here! Come on, Ron.

Ron?

Ron?

RON: Not, not your friends.

I know. I...

They are not having fun.

(SAD MUSIC PLAYING)

(CAMERA CLICKS)

It's weird.

I used to think
that I was the lonely one.

They need to upgrade to a Ron.

I am for making friends.

You mean, for real?

Uh, upgrade them
so they'd all be like you?

Please connect me
to the Bubble network.

Two hundred and twenty-five
million Rons out there!

RON: Please connect me.
(CHUCKLES)

It would be insane!
I mean, amazing, but...

RON: It will be fun.

Huh.

We're right here.
In the middle of the network.

Maybe we could really do this.

It's our one chance.
Now or never.

GUARD 1: Systems are down.
GUARD 2: It won't open!

Uh... Come on, Barney.
What are they doing?

"Upgrade all B-Bots
to be like Ron."

His code is the fix to mine!

I can help them.

BARNEY: Marc? He's helping us.
This is how we do it.

Yes!
GUARD: Come on, kid, open up!

Okay, what do I do?

Um, reboot... Wait!

Please connect me
to the Bubble network.

Oh! Finally, buddy.

Okay. Hold on tight, guys.
You're all getting a Ron!

(STATIC CRACKLING)

Ron. Wait,
where are you going?

Into the network.

No. No way.

You just copy your code
and send that.

The settings
have not been uploaded.

No, no, no.
His code is fragmenting.

He'll disappear! No!

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(MUFFLED SHOUTING)


We'll just have
to go. Forget it.

Come on.
I'm not leaving you behind.

Barney.

I am for making friends.

BARNEY: What?

No. You're coming with me.

How to be a friend.

You taught me.

(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)

No. Stay with me. Remember?

Stay friends.

We can fix it.

You and me.

(POUNDING ON DOOR)

(BREATHES SHAKILY)

Now or never.

(GASPS SHARPLY)


(MELANCHOLY MUSIC CONTINUES)

I guess we'll...

for a good one.

The best one.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Go, Ron. You don't have
to stay within six feet.

Go. Be everywhere.

<i>Adios,</i> Absalom.


<i>Arrivederci,</i> Ron Bintscatsco.

(STATIC CRACKLING)

(CRACKLING STOPS)



(SYSTEM CHIMES, POWERING UP)

(STATIC CRACKLING)




(GASPS IN AWE)



Come on. What is that?
What's happening?


BARNEY: Whoo-hoo!


BARNEY: Hi.

Uh...

I, uh, took a wrong turn.

Oh. Uh...

Right.

This way, please.

(STATIC CRACKLING)

<i>We got him.</i>

Finally. Job done.

(STATIC CRACKLING)

JOSH: Uh, the cameras.

Barney! Hey! There he is!

Oh, Barney!

Move it along.
Everybody outta here.

Did you...?

I'm gonna tell
you everything, Dad.

On the way home.

Okay. Great.


Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Etcetera.

Sorry. Just, um... Uh...

Where were we?

<i>A trick! Data harvesting units
controlled by us.</i>

<i>So we can sell
them stuff. I hate kids!</i>

(GROANS AWKWARDLY)

You know, I've loved my time
as Bubble CEO,

and I wanna thank you all
for your support

over the last
32 historic hours.

But I need to go now
to spend more time with my...

contacts.

So, please welcome back

Marc Wydell.

STUDENT 1: See you later.
STUDENT 2: Here we go again.

STUDENT 3:

BOT 1: That way is good.
BOT 2: This way is good.

(BOT GIGGLES)

Hey! What happened to
staying within six feet?

Guys, where's my troll bot?
Wait...

I get to choose.

(UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING)
(BOT HUMMING)

K-pop? Are you kidding me?

Three months it's been
like this. Come back.

Come on, dude.

BARNEY: <i>So, here I am again.</i>

<i>Eighteen minutes</i>
<i>of recess fun.</i> (CHUCKLES)

<i>Thanks, Ron. You fixed me.</i>

<i>And everyone else.</i>

Hey! We don't know them.

I get to choose your friends.
And I choose everyone!

Friend request.
Friend request.

Hey.
BOT: Friend request.

You've changed the world,
Barney Pudowski.

How cool is that?

BOT 1: Friend request.
BOT 2: Friend request.

Not just me.

Hey! Oh, my gosh!

Aren't you that girl

Video not found.

Oh. My bad.

Thanks. (CHUCKLES)

Come on.

BOT 1: Hi, Barney!
Hey!

GIRL: My bot does
that every time.

BOT 2: Hey there.
Hi.

GIRL: It's so weird.
BOT 3 AND BARNEY: Hi.

He's, like, king of the bots.
They love Pudowski.

Barn, you have got to get back
in that Bubble cloud place.

(ALL SHUSH)

And get this bot to stop
making up its own game rules.

BOT: Free upgrades
for everyone!

How am I ever gonna win?
(ALL LAUGH)

Dude! We gotta tell 'em!

You pranked a global
freakin' tech giant, man!

Please let me stream
the reveal, bro, please?

Take it from me, Rich.
Fame is overrated.

(CHUCKLES)
Look what I brought.

I'll take one.
One for everyone.

Cheers!
ALL: Cheers!

Barney! Hey! You see?

I told you my bench
would work!

(CLUCKING)
Oh!

Yeah. It's great.

(ALL LAUGH)

Mmm. Is all your
gran's food this good?

Come... Come over sometime.
Hang out.

I know you're dying to
see my rock collection.

Will she set us on fire again?

Hope so.
That was so fun!

But you're gonna have to talk
to that goat,

because I do not want
any more of my jewelry

going through its intestines.
