( Woman Echoing )
It's a great pleasure--
( Echoing )
It's a great pleasure--
It's a great pleasure
to have all of you here today.
l thought you all
might begin your tour here.
( Shouting )
( Man ) I really didn't want
a bachelor party in the first place.
I'll tell you why. lt's not
that l'm against tradition.
There's just something bizarre about
having a strange, naked woman...
dance around me while
my friends yell out,
''Go for it, Ben.
Last night of freedom, Ben. "
Last night of freedom
for what ?
Which is what I told
my best friend Alan.
I didn't want any strippers.
I didn't wanna get lucky.
l was lucky enough
just getting married.
All right. Quiet !
( Shouting )
Guys !
All right. l'm not payin' tor that.
lt already was chipped.
We're here to, uh, wish Ben
good luck and good riddance...
as he heads down
that rocky path to matrimony.
And, uh, hey, you know what.
Ben's dad Richard and his grandpa Max
are here. Where are you guys ?
Those guys-- Watch out.
You guys gotta pace yourselves.
Knowing Ben, l'd have
to say that he's probably,
uh, one of the most loyal guys
that l've ever met,
( Man ) Like a dog !
( Man Barks )
and, uh, monogamous.
And so this is probably
gonna be the last time...
that you're gonna spend
in a room with your friends...
and a n-n-naked woman...
other than your wife, man !
So you can close your eyes
if you want to. Close 'em !
But then you're gonna be missin'
Juanita, the bull tamer !
( Shouting )
You don't have to do this.
You really don't
have to do this.
( Man Shouts )
Very nice.
( Crowd )
Ole !
Pop ?
Pop ?
Pop ? Max ?
Call 911.
( Sighs )
How did this happen ? Hmm ?
What's the ditterence
how it happened ?
I wanna know how it happened.
lt happened.
lt makes a difterence
to me.
All ot a sudden he has
a heart attack out of no place ?
Mom, can we please
not talk about this now ?
What is it you don't
want to talk about ?
Mrs. Holmes, it it's any consolation, l
think he was having a really good time.
Alan, shut up.
Okay.
Come into the hall.
What is in the hall ?
A vending machine.
Come on, butchki.
Who's hungry ? l'm buying.
All hours ot the night--
This is insane.
( Richard )
He probably just ate some spicy food.
lt was spicy, all right,
but it wasn't tood.
Butchki !
What ?
Richard, you are
the silliest old tart.
( Sighs )
Grandpa, what came over you ?
( Breathing Heavily )
Hmm ?
Hey.
Ben.
You all right ?
( Chuckles ) Ben.
She was the most
beautitul woman l ever saw.
What about Nana ?
Did you ever take a good look
at your grandmother ?
Woman looked like Tolstoy.
l was never
attracted to her.
Oh, maybe in the beginning,
because she was the only woman
I'd ever been with.
Well, you know, that's great.
That's, uh-- That's loyalty.
Loyalty ? lt's fear.
Did you ever teel her arms, her--
( Groans )
Oh, Ben, I used to
dream about other women.
What it would be like
to hold them and to--
Okay.
Touch them and to--
That's--
Smell them.
Grandma smelled. She had
a very distinct smell. lt was a--
Ben. Ben.
Listen to me.
Don't tie yourselt down.
Even if you love
a woman, it tades.
Marriage is a prison.
( Siren Wails )
Ben !
Could l help you out ?
Here we go.
You just passed my room.
Sorry.
Feel better.
( Sighs )
Hi.
Hi, sweetie.
Honey.
Oh, why does everything feel
so much better now that you're here ?
How's he doing ?
He's stable.
You know, physically, at least.
Great.
What happened ?
What do you expect ? He's an 80-year-old
man with high blood pressure...
and a naked balloon-popping toreador
is a rough combination.
lt didn't pan out. lt's not funny.
lt's not funny.
Be serious.
There's something l want to do.
Okay. Why ?
l wanna be able to remember
this moment in 30 or 40 years.
Think my next husband
will get a kick out of it.
Oh, that's nice.
Okay.
lt's the night before I am flying down
to Savannah tor our wedding alone,
because Ben's grandtather, who we
will now reter to as Larry Flynt,
has partied himselt
into intensive care.
What do you have to say ?
Put the video camera away.
No, no, no, honey,
you're not going to get off that easy.
No, l'm saving it
for my vows.
l have already
finished my vows.
What's in 'em ?
( Laughs )
You know why ? Because
it's easy tor you. l'm a writer.
Oh, really ?
l can't just slap something
down on paper like you do.
Ben, listen.
You don't have
to be brilliant...
or witty or clever
or polite even.
Just have
to be honest.
Come on. Say something.
What are you feeling ?
Are you nervous ?
Are you happy ? Are you scared ?
Am l scared ?
What would I be scared ot ?
l'm scared.
You are ? Why ?
Now you're making me scared.
Because it's a big thing. lt's our
marriage. lt's the rest of our lives.
lt's-- lt's scary.
l know. l'm not scared.
The only thing we have to tear--
Yeah ?

lt's a book ot quotes.
I crossed out the ones l'm gonna
use in my toast. Listen.
''To say that you can love
one person all your lite...
is like saying that one candle will
continue to burn as long as you live.''
Think about that for a minute.
l will. That's profound.
This is used.
l forgot the rings.
That's not tunny.
No, don't do that.
( Laughs )
I torgot the rings, so--

Oh ! Jack Bealy,

Ben Holmes,

Yeah, l was married once.
Yeah ?
To me marriage
is just one big lie.
You don't say.
ln the morning l had to say,
''Don't be silly, honey.
Your breath is fine.
You smell like a rose.''
Then l had to say, ''No, honey.
l never noticed
that 18-year-old girl...
with the tantastic body and halter top
that delivers our newspaper.
She can't hold
a candle to you...
and the 30 pounds you've put on
since we stopped having sex.''
( Paper Rustles )
So when's the wedding day ?
May cancel it.
l may have to call back.
l didn't mean to throw a wet towel on ya
with my whole marital disaster tirade.
lt's all right. lt was a nice story
actually. lt was very touching.
Nice girl ?
Very nice.
As a matter ot fact, l just happen
to have a picture of her right here.
Wow, what a knockout.
Yeah, she's beautitul.
Oh, baby, come to Daddy.
Well, take it easy, Jack.
What l wouldn't give

Huh ? Here we go.
Hi.

Do you work for Hallmark ?
( Gull Screeching )
Even if l had seen you looking at it,
that wouldn't bother me.
Well, l don't care either.
l'm absolutely tascinated you
can't admit you saw me reading it.
lf l had seen you reading it,
l'd be perfectly happy to admit it.
Then why did you
close your computer ?
l'm known to do that
trom time to time.
l'm a rebel. l'll open it,

Don't get next to my fire,

There's no official word

There may have been

Let's get some help !
She hit her head.

Everyone's pretty shook up.
We had a couple ot passengers go to

Oh, my God. There he is again.

Oh, Ben ! l love you.
Call me ! No. Go back.
There you have it.
The latest information--
( Phone Rings )
Hello ? Ah, Ben !
Hi, honey. Yeah, l'm fine.
No, l'm okay.
l'm a little trazzled.
l mean, l was
in a plane crash.
This place is a nightmare.
People are running around.
l guess they lost everything.
l don't care about any ot that.
l'm just so happy you're okay.
l-l-l just wish that--
Ben ! Ben, listen.
TelI him, um--
What happened ?
You just get yourself
down here sate and sound.
The thing is, l'm a little bit scared
to fly before l was in a plane crash,
so l don't teel
much like getting--
Jesus !
You are a god.
You are a god amongst all men.
Do you realize that ?
l'm on the phone.
Sorry.
Do you mind ?
What in the hell ?
Just one ot the passengers.
He saved my lite !
She's kidding.
lt's a joke.
l'm gonna get a rental car
and drive down there, okay ?
l'll call you w-w-when
I have a finalized plan.
Okay, great.
Thank you, sir.
( Phone Line Buzzing )
Sorry. I couldn't
contain myself.
lt's amazing when you think about it.
We almost died today. Dead.
lsn't there a rent-a-car this way ?
Are we goin' the right way ?
It l died, how
many people would care ?
l mean, really care.
You'd have your shares of ''What a shame.
What a waste.
She was so young.''
But no real crying.
lt might be in that terminal.
No eating disorders,
no attempted suicides.
Nothing.
Absolutely depressed.
You know what ?
l'm thoroughly depressed.
l just need to shake it otf.
( Muttering )
So what were you thinking ?
l was thinking how it would attect
our trequent flier miles.
What do you do
tor a living ?
l'm a, uh,
jacket copywriter.
Huh. What does that mean ?
Means l write jackets
to books basically.
Oh.
Do mostly fiction,
but l do some nontiction.
You do blurbs. You're a blurb writer.
You're a ''blurbologist.''
l'm a jacket copywriter.
( Woman On P. A. )
As you can imagine,
due to today's minor incident--
Oh, sh--
( Chattering )
Nada cars. Non cars.
Cars nyet.
Nada cars. Non cars.
Cars nyet.
You should have called
as soon as you got otf the plane.
Why didn't l think of that
when l was unconscious...
and bleeding trom the head ?
So, cars nyet. We can check
the other airports though.
No, that's all right.
You can go ahead.
l'm not that big a fan ot the idea
of getting on another plane today...
or tomorrow or ever,
it that soon.
But you go ahead.
l think l'm gonna be a ground
transportation kind ot guy trom now on.
l'll be right back.
How ya doin' ?
Did ya get a car ?
-This is Vic. He's gonna give us a ride.
-All the way to Georgia ?
Sure. We split the cost
ot the car, the gas, whatever.
Great.
Good. Let's go.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait.
We don't even know this guy.
He's Vic.
Oh, he's Vic.

What's your story, Ben ?
What's down in Savannah ?
My wedding, Vic.
No kiddin'. That's great.
lsn't that great ?
Yeah, it's a blessing.
First marriage ?
That l know of, yeah.
Yeah, l was married once.
One day l walk into the house
and l hear the shower runnin'.
l had Chinese tood with me, figurin'
it wouId be a nice romantic surprise.
She starts singin'
in the shower.
What's that song ?
''Up in the sky'' ? ''Up with the eagles'' ?
''Wind Beneath My Wings.''
Very touching song.
''Wind Beneath My Wings.''
Suddenly there's another
voice in the shower with her.
Oh, no.
A baritone.
Uh-oh.
Now it's a treakin' duet.
So l walk in the bathroom and
there she is... with my brother.
Oh !
l grab my brother and throw
him through the window naked.
He broke his leg
in two difterent places.
Dare we ask what,
uh, became of your wife ?
l put the wind beneath her ass
and sent her packin'. Divorced her.
She never got a penny,
the lyin', whorin', adulteratin' pig.
What about you, sweetheart ?
What's your story ?
l'm going down to visit my brother
and hang out with my nephew.
That's nice. kids.
Yep. Got any ?
Nah. But l see 'em all over.
So what else have you
jacket copywritten ?
What else did l do ?
The low point of my career was...
l did the blurb
tor a thriller...
about a woman--
an archaeologist--
who tinds love
in the pyramids.
lt was called
Me And My Pharaoh.
l have that book.
No, you don't.
Yes, l do. ''A scintillating tale
ot erotic mummitication.''
l wrote that line.
Oh, my God ! That's
why I bought the book.
Anybody who could tind embalming
either scintillating or erotic...
had to be read.
It was brilliant.
Well, you know, l mean,
it's all about adjectives.
l was gonna go with ''engaging tale
ot erotic mummitication'' tirst.
But then l said, no, scintillating.
Right on the money.
lt's still selling now,
but at least l get to write.
What do you do ?
l haven't settled down
to one particular thing yet.
Worked at galleries, sold cars,
tried out tor ''Aladdin On lce.''
Um, wedding videographer.
l got fired, though, because
apparently nobody wants a crash zoom...
to the priest
during the ceremony.
l was a exotic dancer,
hostess at the New York auto show.
That's a gift.
Yeah.
Let's see. What else ?
ls there anything else ?
l don't think so.
kids, we should get goin'.
You got it, Vic.

This may be an everyday event in your
life, but speaking as a non-felon--
l'm on a bit of
a time crunch here, too, okay ?
lf l don't make it down to Savannah by
Saturday morning, l lose 25,000 bucks.
Are you on Dig For Dollars ?
You told me you were going to
visit your brother and nephew.
Yeah, l know.
( Key Jingling )
Okay, kids.
Here's the situation.
Vic DeFranco was driving
with an expired license.
Plus he's got three priors
tor possession and selling.
And there was ten ounces in the vehicle
that he admits is his.
Did anybody else know
there were drugs in the car ?
-No, sir. ln fact, l just met this man--
-You can't--
You can't ask us these questions
without an attorney present.
You haven't advised us
of our rights.
l believe that's called--
Oh-- Ah !
A Miranda violation. That's it.
This is a
very simple procedure.
You tell me you didn't do
anything illegal. you sign a
statement. And you go quietly.
Sir, l'd like to be considered
separate from her, sir.
Hmm. What part of quiet
didn't you understand ?
What are you doing ?
( Man )
Why me ?
( Sighs )
Well, l think that went well.
l'm not that happy with how that went.
No ?
No, not really.
l haven't known you that long, but
l think something may be wrong with you.
( Train Horn Blowing )
( Ben ) May we have two tickets
to Savannah, please ?
You want these seats
together ?
lt's totally up to you.
Just give me one second.
Can l talk to you ?
Yeah.
l just, uh--
l don't want to be rude or anything,
but in situations like this,
l think about...
what l would want Bridget to do
it the situation were reversed.
l wouldn't necessarily be
that comtortable with her...
riding down on a train
together with some guy...
who she had a,
you know, kind ot a connection...
or a chemistry or spark,
whatever, some kind
of a thing like that.
You know, and--
The look on your tace
is telIing me you have no--
Yo u're not feeling
or you're not sensing--
You have no idea what l'm--
Oh, no, no, not really.
Fascinating. Okay.
Maybe we just shouldn't
ride down together,
because at this point l really
made kind of a chump out of myselt.
Okay.

and the plane crash, it was, uh, tun.

that sex was some horrible obligation

like cramps or high heels.

she never experienced a genuine orgasm.

with honesty, Ben, you know that ?
Oh.
You can't tell your tiancee
what's going on.
You can't explain something absolutely
simple and innocent to your best man,
and you are
with me, Ben !
You could have left a hundred times,
but you didn't !
I tried to !
Then why are you still here ?
l'm leaving !
All right, tine !
You wanna talk about honesty ?
Let's talk about honesty.
Bring it on.
You complain about your lite,
nonstop, all the time.
( Mimicking Sarah )
lt's all your tault.
You are a beautiful, incredible woman.
You could have any guy you wanted,
but you keep picking
these losers.
And the only thing l can think ot
is that you choose these guys...
who are intellectually inferior to you
so that you can control them,
but still teel conveniently wounded
when the relationship ends.
You're the one that's afraid
of commitment. You back out
of every job you ever have !
You run away from anyone
and anything,
and you think it's so
unconventional and liberating,
when in tact, it's just
cowardice and juvenile...
and unable to face
the real world !
Ha ! Okay, you want honesty,
l'll give you honesty.
Do you know why you can't
write your marriage vows ?
Because you are absolutely territied
that you have nothing to say.
And why would you, Ben ?
Because you run around so scared...
that lite is gonna throw you this
curveball that'll completely shatter...
this crystal clear, pertect
existence that you've created
for yourselt in your Day Timer,
that you blurb your way out of teeling
anything emotional, anything real.
You have no emotions, and that's
what makes you a shitty writer, Ben.
You know what ?
At least l don't sit around obsessing...
that no one's going to
come to my tuneral,
because l have relationships
that last longer than a week.
My funeral is gonna be packed !
You know what, Ben ?
That is just great.
And l know your eulogy...
is gonna look so nice
on the back of a book cover.
l just think you are
an immature, seltish person.
WelI, l'm
obviously wrong.
Have a fabulous time in Westchester.
l do hope you enjoy the minivan.
God ! How great it must be to be
so cool and above everyone, huh ?
lt must be great !
Let me ask you somethin'.
How cool is it
to abandon your kid ?
l was 17 years old, okay ? Fuck you.
You don't know anything about it.
All right, weIl, try 27, Sarah,
Nothing.
because seventeen's not
working anymore.
Okay, Ben, take your marriage Clift
Notes and have a nice wedding, okay ?
Have a nice divorce.
Okay.
Four, three, two, one.
Okay, l'm leaving.
Hey, Deb, he's comin'.
Five minutes. There he is.
l think he's-- Come on !
No, no, no,
don't--
Well, that was smooth.
You're getting married tomorrow, Ben.
What's your point ?
Well, you see, if I'm
gonna turn my life around,
l can't very well
break up your marriage.
l'll have bad luck tor the rest of
my lite, karmically speaking, and I--
l am getting
married tomorrow,
l have nonretundable
tickets to Hawaii,
and l cannot make myself
leave this room.
Well, l like you too, Ben.
l--
I can't go through
with a marriage like that. l can't.
Ben, relax.
We didn't even get to second base.
Have you seen Dr. Holmes
and his wife ?
We're doing the raftle.
He's not Dr. Holmes,
and she's not his wite.
Okey dokey ?
Okey dokey ?
( Sighs )
l'm gonna tell her.
l think at the very least
she deserves that.
lf l can teel this way
about someone else--
Hey I
Come on !
Why does this have to get dangerous ?
Get in, you treak !
God I
( Tires Screeching )

Yeah.
Yeah, it was.
Now what are you
gonna do ?
l don't know. Let's go get
the money my tather wired.
That should get us
a cab at least.
This is actually the pertect car
for this trip.
lt's already been wrecked, totaled
and destroyed. What else can go wrong ?
( Clamoring, Shouting )
Well, you asked.
( Chuckles )
RealIy. That's interesting.
( Laughs )
That's not really

Oh, good evening.
( Laughing )
Good evening.
Good evening.
Hi, Joe.
lt is a good evening, isn't it ?
( Group Murmuring )
Dr. Holmes, or whoever it is you are.
We made a call. There's no
Dr. Ben Holmes in New York City.
Unless you're
a veterinary brain surgeon.
Well, all God's creatures
are welcome in my otfice.
But the way you two carry on,
you oughta be ashamed of yourselves !
You tell 'em.
There is the matter of your bill.
( Mumbling )
Thank you very much.
l'm really sorry.
( Sighs )
Let's look at this bill here.
Seems a little excessive.
No, if you add the two and the two,
that's tour, and then, uh--
Run I
Jesus I Jesus !
How long do you think
before they call the police ?
Oh, about tive minutes ago.
All right.
Yesterday l was just trying
to get married, today l'm a fugitive.
Okay, l get it now.
This is a sign.
This whole thing is a sign.
l am not supposed to get married.
Loud and clear.
We have to be in Savannah
in the morning.
The tuzz
are atter us.
Hey, Ben, how much was that car
we saw back in the lot ?
The disaster car ?
lt was &150.
'Cause l'm thinking
that if, uh--
lt somebody went
into this place right here...
and did, you know, a little
bump and grind tor the good
old boys, they could, uh--
they could probably walk
out ot there with that amount
ot money in their pocket.
Strip dancing ?
You're saying you'd just go in
and strip dance ? l'm talking
about something serious.
Ben, let's weigh out
our alternatives here.
On one hand, what do we have ?
We have a little harmless dancing...
that gets us to Savannah
where l have &25,000 waiting tor me,
and you have what, 130 ot your closest
family and friends waiting for you.
And on the other hand,
we have-- oh, look, we have nothing.
Oh, there's nothing there.
So, we have dancing, going
to Savannah. Oh, nothing !
l see where you're going with this.
You know l'm right.
( Police Siren )
( Police Radio, lndistinct )
The tuzz.
AIl right. Am l being
too prudish about this ?
ls that what it is ? Maybe l am.
l just gotta open my mind.
You go in there, you take your
clothes otf, you have the power.
Post-feminist. lt's aggressive.
You have the power and control.
l know what l'm doing.
Watch my back.
Watch your back ?
What, are we on Mod Squad now ?
Hiya. How ya doin' ?
Good.
l was wondering if y'all
had any entertainment.
We got a pool table out back.
What would you say
to somebody dancing on it...
tor a set price of,
l don't know, &150 ?
I could guarantee you
a really good show.
&150 seems like a lot of money.
What ? Look at her.
l am looking at her.
l'm not interested.
How much tor you
to dance ?
Excuse me ?
Ben,

l think this is
one of these places...
where everyone would much rather
see you dance than see me dance.
You mean--
@ Get your hands off of my man @
@ Get your hands off of my man @
@ Get your hands off of my man @
lt's not tunny anymore,
because l don't even like...
to be naked at home
in my shower by myself.
So, it was okay tor me a minute ago ?
Well, it's on your resume.
lf you want me to blurb you
a novel, l could do that.
So much for power and control,
big guy. Get up there.
All right, l'm sorry.
There you go.

Yeah.
Just be honest.
lf her tather happens
to shoot me on my way out,
l guess I'll see you in heaven.

tor the sanctity

l am not talking to you, Virginia !
Where's Bridget ? l want to marry her.
Who the hell are you ?
Someone who gets
to a wedding on time !
Hi, we haven't met. l'm Ben.
Steve Montgomery. l used to go out with
Bridget and l'm still in love with her.
Can l see your invitation ?
Hey, hey, hey, hey !
Excuse me ! Somebody should be asking
for your invitation, all right ?
P. S.-- you shouldn't even
be having a wedding !
l saw him in the hotel
last night with some woman !
Whoa ! Hey, untrue I
They are just travel friends.
And she's ugly !
( Chatter, Shouting )
Why do you New Yorkers
have to be so unpleasant ?
l like New York.
Put 'em up !
( Shouting Continues )
Ben ?
Yeah ?
Um, in about tive minutes, we're
supposed to be joined tor eternity,
and l was wondering...
if you were gonna get dressed.
( Thunder Rumbling )
WelI, it it's eternity,
it can wait. ( Chuckles )
( Chuckles )
No, no, l think technically
eternity starts immediately,
especially when there's
ice sculpture involved.
Well, Bridge.
Yeah.
( Thunder Rumbling )
The truth is--
( Sobs )
l'm sorry.
This always happens at weddings,
you know ? ( Snitfles )
l'm sorry l took so long
to get down here. Something happened.
lt's okay.
l know.
Debbie told me, and l told her that
it didn't matter because l trusted you,
and I knew you wouldn't
cheat on me.
And then l threw up. But, um--
Everything else was going wrong.
Everything was going wrong,
and my parents are separated,
and then this guy Steve,
who--
Bridge, you know what ?
l always thought that there
was this one perfect person
tor everybody in the world.
And when you tound
that person,
like the rest of the world
just kind ot magically taded away...
and the two ot you would just
be inside this kind ot...
protective bubble,
but there is no bubble.
l mean, or if there is,
we have to make it.
l just think that life is more
than a series of moments, you know ?
We can make choices, and we can choose
to protect the people we love,
and that's what makes us who we are,
and those are the real miracles.
Stop me when it just becomes glaringly
obvious that l have no idea...
what l'm talking about.
No, l know what you're talking about.
l do. l know exactIy
what you're taIking about.
Farewell, Ben.
l tell in love with you
the moment l saw you.
And when l saw you up there
on the balcony, l tell in Iove
with you all over again.
None ot the plane crashes
and the hurricanes...
and the other people
will ever change that.
Because when l'm on my deathbed,
l'm gonna know...
that l married the only woman
l ever really loved.
l think you just
wrote your vows.
( Chuckles )
l love you so much.
( Chuckles )
( Shouting, Clamoring )
( Virginia ) Get her out of the rain !
Guys, hold on.
( Shouting )
You guys, it's only rain.
AIl right, all right.
l'm okay.
l'll be right back.
lt's okay.
Bridge ! Bridget !
You wanna get married
like this ?
Let's go get married...
under a waterfall in Hawaii !
