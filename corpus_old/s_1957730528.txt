[Indistinct chatter]

I need another fish and chips,
stat!

Hey, slate.

What are you doing Saturday?

Driving down to Atlantic city
to see some friends.

-You're dating someone.
-Jessica?

No, it's, it's not really
a defined thing.

-Oh, yeah?
-Anyway, it wouldn't be a date.

Just trying to help.

-Well, how's that?
-I see her in there.

Your inner gambler
trying to get out.

Oh, worry not, my lady,
I'm here to set her free.

Well, what about
my outer nursing grad

with a job interview on Monday?

What about her? She's got
all day Sunday to rest up.

-I don't know.
-Am I hearing a yes?

You're hearing
I gotta think about it.

Mm, that's not what I'm hearing.

I'm hearing,
"I can't wait, bill.

What time should I be ready?"

[Upbeat music]

Come on, Greeves. Be bold.

I got this one.

-Looking good.
-Looking good.

No!

Yeah. Well, that's it for me.

Like hell it is.
You are my rabbit's foot.

It's play money.
Don't worry about it.

Just remember, it's 21 or under.

If it was over,
you would be killin' it.

Okay, okay.

It's play money, right?

Watch me win now.

You got roommates?

-I do, my mom and my step-dad.
-I see.

Mm. I had way too much to drink.

You had fun is what you had.

That is true. Thank you.

Your parents still up?

You are not getting lucky
tonight, young man.

Well, it didn't even occur
to me.

I don't believe you.

But okay.

-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

Can I have my jacket back,
please?

Yes, you can.

Maybe next time.

Next time what?

[Instrumental music]

You'll get lucky.

And that's your fish...

I'll check on you in a minute.

Oh. Well, how was Atlantic city?
Tell me.

Details, details, please.

He's fun.

Didn't treat me like some
delicate flower, which I like.

He's got an ex-wife,
but she's not in the picture.

Okay, and what about
the girlfriend?

She's in California
for a few weeks.

-Oh, so he's cheating on her.
-Not yet, he's not.

Not yet with you.

-Right.
-Here we go again.

Ah, where's my medium-rare
surf 'n' turf?

-What is that supposed to mean?
-It's supposed to mean...

That I've known you since
fifth grade, and we both

know you don't know
how to pick 'em.

Look, just go slow, okay?

Deserve someone
who treats you well.

[Upbeat music]

a few weeks,

but I gotta show you off.

Don't be nervous,
they're only like family to me,

so the stakes
couldn't be higher.

[Indistinct pop song]

There he is, ladies
and gentlemen, late as usual.

All the way from Woodbridge,
New Jersey,

third petty officer McGuire.

-Missed you, bro.
-And his stunning plus one!

My god! She's beautiful, bill!

Marry her fast
before she spooks.

Hi, I'm sue.

Look at you.
Bill warned you about me, right?

-Lion's den, I told her.
-Oh, stop. No, I'm a pussycat.

Let's get you a drink.

[Song continues]

-You're a nurse, right?
-Uh, yeah, I just got my degree.

I'm working at a fertility
clinic up in Woodbridge.

-Right on. How's that going?
-Oh, I love it so far.

Our work
brings a lot of joy to people.

-Not every time, though?
-No.

But for most couples, you know,

with all the options
that are out there right now,

where there's a will,
there's a way.

But I should tell you about
the new recommendation

for couples trying to conceive

based
on the latest medical data.

Yeah, tell me.

Have a lot of sex.

-Cheers to that.
-Yeah.

[Song continues]

Mm... this is your happy place,
isn't it?

I wanna end up here.

Virginia beach is growing.

It's gonna be a demand
for system engineers.

Well, you should do it.

Someday.

Till then I just get down here
as much as I can.

Too bad it's a seven-hour drive.

Well, it depends who's with me.

[Indistinct pop song]

[Instrumental music]

-[Woman laughing]
-They can see us.

-Better?
-Much.

[Music continues]

So, I decided.

I'm movin' out
of my parents' place.

-Really? Finally! This is huge.
-I know, right?

And I may have found
a roommate already.


-Bill McGuire.
-Ugh, seriously?

-I know it's fast...
-Oh, yeah, no kidding.

But we spent the whole drive
back from Virginia talking

about it and we're both
really ready to explore this.

Okay, but living together?

I mean, how well
do you even know him?

-I'm a big girl.
-Oh.

And, yeah, maybe he's got
some rough edges,

but nothing that I can't fix.

Okay, and when has that
ever worked out?

You know,
I should probably warn him.

Remember what happened
with Tony Parisi

and that girl
from Staten island? Ah-ah-ah!

You shoved him
outside the door butt-naked

and you locked the door
behind him.

-He deserved it.
-You sent him to the hospital.

The temperature
sent him to the hospital.

How was I supposed to know
it was five below zero?

Oh, honey, you knew.

You're not gonna tell
these stories when

you're my maid of honor,
are you?

Shut up. You're joking, right?

Are you engaged
and you didn't tell me?

-Are you serious, Mel?
-Well... no, I'm joking!

Well, why would you do that
to me, Mel? Come on!

But I'm telling you right now...

It's gonna be him.

You really like him, don't you?

I do.


[Instrumental music]

How much was that?

Twenty-five hundred.

-Which I'm about to win back.
-Can't you win it back tomorrow?

Twenty more minutes, baby.

Hey, go on up to the room.
I'll be there soon.

Okay?

[Crowd cheering]

[Intense music]

good luck, everyone.

[Bill grunting]

What time did you get in
last night?

I don't know. 3:00, 4:00.

I got pulled
into this serious game of poker.

-I missed you.
-Well, you got me now.

[Knocking on door]

-Mm.
-Mm.

Thank you, sir.

-Wow!
-Who's hungry?

Oh, my god. Yes, please.

[Locker beeping]

So I could not crack this player
last night, I thought

I had his tell, but then
he beat me six hands straight.

-His tell?
-Yeah.

Something somebody does
that tells you they're bluffing.

So maybe he rubs his nose,

maybe he holds his cards
a certain way.

It could be anything.

Well, this guy kept rubbin'
his sunglasses.

Turns out
they were just fogging up.

To another memorable evening.

And morning.

[Instrumental music]

-Mm.
-Mm.

So what's your tell,
bill McGuire?

Shh! I will never say.

Okay. Well, then what's my tell?

-Easy. Your smile. There it is.
-My smile?

Right there. A thousand watts
of blinding light.

-That is so not true. Mm.
-It's the ultimate smokescreen.

-You're even using it now.
-Oh, really?

-Mm-hmm.
-How is that?

Because you saw me in the mirror
a minute ago,

and now you're trying
desperately not to let on.

It's okay, babe.

[Melanie chuckles]

Melanie slate...


Will you marry me?

Yes! Yes!

Oh, my god! Oh, my god,
it's gorgeous.

-Can you afford this?
-It's okay, I know a guy.

And look at you. You're worth it
a thousand times over.

[Instrumental music]

[Instrumental music]

[Doorbell ringing]

-Yeah, can I help you?
-Hi.

I'm Marci Polsky. I...

-I was married to bill McGuire.
-Oh.

I was hoping
we could talk for a minute.

Uh, you couldn't have called
first?

I was afraid
you might tell bill.

Oh, my god, he lets you
get your nails done?

Um, look, I'm sorry,
but why are you here exactly?

To warn you, like I wish
someone had warned me.

Just two minutes,
woman to woman.

Uh, ex-wife to<i> fiancee,</i>
you mean.

Please?

Yup.

Look, Marci,
what bill and I have together,

it's not what you guys had.

-Not yet. I'm your preview.
-Marci...

He's a serial cheater,
every chance he gets.

He probably cheated on someone
to be with you.

And he disappears. Get ready for
that, for-for weeks, sometimes.

Okay, enough.
You really should leave.

Look, the real reason
I came here is

I know what that man's capable
of, and I couldn't live

with myself
if something happened to you.

-He was violent with you?
-Not exactly.

-But trust me, he has it in him.
-Not exactly?

The times he wanted to hurt me
are too many to count.

By the end,
I was scared for my safety.

I mean,
you've seen his temper, right?

[Engine revving]

[Dramatic music]

What's goin' on?
What's she doing here?

-She just decided to show up.
-Okay, Marci.

This is harassment.
You can't just come over...

-I'm talking to her, Billy.
-Not anymore.

-We'd like for you to leave.
-Right.

Got it. No good deed.

You'll learn the hard way now.

Good luck to you, really.

[Melanie scoffs]

Feel sorry for her.

She just can't stand the idea
of me being happy.

-[Scoffs]
-You okay?

Yeah, I mean,
she's lying, right?

-How can you even ask me that?
-No, I know.

O-Of course,
of course she's lying.

-Yeah. She's lying.
-Yeah. I'm sorry. Um..

Just come on inside, okay?
I made dinner.

[Eerie music]

[Instrumental music]

Apparently, I've grown a little.

Okay, impossible. Look at you.

Not so impossible.


-We weren't even trying.
-Oh, my god!

-How far along are you?
-Seven weeks.

We weren't gonna be sharing the
news, but I just had to tell ya.

Because I'm the godmother,
right?

Well, you're in the running.

I'm in the running?

Oh, bill's sisters.

-He's lobbying for Cindy.
-[Selene] Oh.

Ahem. The guests are seated.
How much longer?

Ugh! Speak of the devil.
Uh, five minutes.

Yeah, well, he can lobby,
but I'm not going down

without a fight.

Oh! Babe, look at you.

Getting married,
a baby on the way.

Okay, well, you really just hit
that light-speed button. Hm?

-I know, right?
-Well...

You better hold on 'cause
things are about to get real.

Let's get a picture
if you ladies are ready.

Great.

[Indistinct chatter]

[Instrumental music]

So all we need
is a four-bedroom house

in a nice neighborhood with
a great school for the boys.

Do we need to spend 500k?

We spent half that
in Virginia beach.

How would that even work for us?

No, my job is here. My parents
are here. Child care...

We're never getting out of here.

Oh. Sweetie.

Virginia beach can still be
our long-term plan.

Okay? I wanna
move there, too, someday.

But right now this is
the best place for our family.

University's gonna promote me,
I think. Did I tell you?

That's fantastic!

Adjunct professor
to tenure track.

I'm still gonna handle
all the network contracts,

but that classroom stuff will be
some extra security for us.

And it's gonna look really good
on our mortgage application.

Did I tell you,
one of my clients said

it's a great time
to buy right now.

Come on, boys, eat up.

Finish your chicken.

Hey.

Can we please,

please, go out shopping
this weekend?

Mm, sure, why not?

Clearly there's no stopping you.

Right answer.

Happy wife, happy life.

See you next week.

[Indistinct announcement on pa]

-Oh!
-Ooh!

And there's a terrible crash
on turn three, race fans!

There's debris
all over the track.

It's a miracle
both drivers are walking away.

-Wow.
-Gosh, I am so sorry.

No, it's fine. You're okay.

-Uh, can I help you?
-Yeah.

-Hi. I'm Dr. Miller.
-Hi.

Can you point me
to the conference room?

-Uh, Dr. Scott's expecting me.
-Oh, of course, doctor.

Uh, it's to the left
at the nurses' station.

-Right. Thanks.
-Yeah.

Okay.

The clinic hired
another partner.

-I have four bosses.
-Oh, who is he?

I don't know, some big-shot
from D.C. he's hot, though.

Got the whole nursing staff
just drooling over him.

Yeah? Is he single?

-Of course not.
-They never are.

-So you guys gonna buy a house?
-Yes.

And I'm excited to have a bigger
house, better neighborhood.

Well, here's
to living the dream.


-Hey, Selene. How's it going?
-Mm! Hey, bill.

-Wanna join us?
-Ooh, can't. Sorry.

-Well, where are you going?
-Ac.

Uh, it's date night.
The boys are with my parents.

It's gonna have to be next week.

Walter asked me
to drive down with him.

Oh, I transferred some money
to casino line.

Oh, hey, uh, bill.

Uh, there's no more play money.

Okay? We're gonna have
a lot of housing costs soon.

We really need
to be saving money.

Don't worry.
Tonight I'm gonna win.

Don't wait up.

[Intense music]

-[Door opens]
-Mel...

-Sweetie.
-[Door shuts]

What's going on?

It never stops.

[Instrumental music]

Hi!

Daniela. Hey, I'm Melanie.

Hi, Melanie. Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.
What a beautiful accent.

-Where are you from, Daniela?
-Oh, I'm from Brazil.

-I'm here for school.
-In Newark?

Yeah, uh, New Jersey
institute of technology.

Njit. It's a good school.
My husband actually works there.

-Oh, right on.
-Yeah.

All right, Daniela, so have you
ever donated eggs before?

No, but a friend of mine did and
she said it was a perfect way

to make some extra cash,
you know?

-Hey, I-I-I wanted to ask you.
-Mm-hmm.

This guy I'm seeing is worried

that the hormones will interfere
with our sex life.

Is that true?

It can happen for some donors,

but most of the time
the biggest complaint

is just the mood swings.

Well, nothing he can't fix
with some fine jewelry, right?

I like the way you think,
Daniela.

Oh, call me Dani. Everyone does.

Okay, Dani.
Uh, so today's pretty simple.

It's really
just about blood work.

Got a gown for you right here.

I'm gonna step out while you get
undressed, and the doctor

and I will be back
in a few minutes, okay?

-Okay.
-Okay.

Dani? Dani Da Cruz?

Yup, Daniela Cruz.

I know, I should've been
a pop star, right?

[Breathing heavily]

[Intense music]

[Breathing heavily]

God...

Oh, god!

-[Brad] Is she ready?
-Yeah.

-You okay?
-Yeah.

You look like
you could use a minute.

Look, I'll have Gail
cover for you.

No, no, no, no,
it's a blood draw

and there are tricky veins and
Gail gets nervous. It's fine.

I'll do it myself, then.

It's fine, thank you.

[Dramatic music]

[Daniela laughing]


[Daniela laughing]

Mm...


[Intense music]

[Daniela laughing]

Love you.

[Music continues]

[Daniela giggling]

Bye.

Bye.

[Music continues]


Almost eaten
all of these for breakfast.

-Morning.
-Hey.

-I waited up all night for you.
-Sorry. Had that faculty thing.

I tried to sneak out,
but Marty wouldn't let me.

I thought
it was an early dinner.

-What time did you get back?
-Oh, it was late 'cause...

You're not gonna believe it.
Here, some more juice, bud.

By the time I get out of there,
car is missing.

Campus police towed it. Took me
three hours to get it back.

Wow. What a night.

Mm-hmm. No kiddin'.

All right, gotta go.

[Eerie music]

[Indistinct announcement on pa]

All right, tell Ms. Singh
her husband needs to get

a motility analysis.

And Ms. Parker, uh...

Actually, her progesterone's
back up...

I'm sorry.
Ms. Singh needs, um...

-What did you say?
-You okay?

Yeah, I'm sorry,
it's just, uh...

It's just home stuff.

Well, um, not that
it's any of my business,

but if there's anything
we can do for you here...

-Days off? Shorter hours?
-No.

-Paid cruise?
-No.

Um, that's very kind of you.

It's not kind. Selfish.

You're our best nurse.
We'd fall apart without you.

[Instrumental music]

-Um, yeah, Ms. Singh...
-I need... yeah.

Well, I actually need you
to sign this, um...

This paper.

[Instrumental music]

[Music continues]


[Indistinct chatter]

-Well, cheers.
-Cheers.

[Music continues]

[Indistinct chatter]

I'm really sorry, if you could
try, uh, cashing it tomorrow,

I'll make sure
that the funds are in there.

Yeah, thank you. I really
appreciate it. Okay, bye.

Go brush your teeth.

[Instrumental music]

-[Cell phone vibrating]
-[Bill laughing]

<i>You know what to do.</i>

Jack's preschool check just
bounced. Where are you? Call me.

[Music continues]

a call on line three.

-Hi, it's Melanie.
-Hey, it's me.

Why are you calling me here?
Are the boys okay?

Your cell is off. Boys are fine.

<i>-I've good news for you.</i>
-Well, what is it?

Our offer was accepted.
We got the house.

Oh, that's...

-[Melanie]<i> Well, that's great.</i>
-Congratulations.

I hope this is good news
for you, too.

It is.
I just hope we can afford it.

Well, we can as long
as we're careful with our money.

You know, what, I got
a lot of work to do, I gotta go.

<i>See you later.</i>

All right, bye.

[Dramatic music]

[Intense music]

Think he suspects?

I don't really care.

What's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

So where do you see us
taking this?

To every bed
we can find together.

I'm serious.

Well, Iâ€™m...

I'm not ready
to divorce my wife.

-If that's what you're asking.
-No.

I mean, I am, but I wouldn't
wanna do that to the kids.

I'm a child of divorce,
I don't want that for them.

Or maybe I'm just a coward.
I don't know.

Mm, no, you are not.

Well, lots of people
are stuck in bad relationships.

But I'll never escape him,
though.

His gambling is a wrecking ball,

for our future
and the boys' future.


an offer we made on a house
was accepted, which is crazy.

But at least it's money

that he can't gamble away.

Well, maybe this could be
a fresh start.

You guys can start over.

He'll never change.

I want a do-over.

[Instrumental music]

[Instrumental music]

[Laptop keys clacking]

What are you doing up?

Oh, Iâ€™m... I couldn't sleep.

So I'm just, uh, gettin'
some work done.

3:00 in the morning?
Come back to bed.

I'll be there in a minute.

[Cell phone vibrating]

[Intense music]

[Water sloshing]

[Dramatic music]

[Cell phone ringing]

Hi. Mm-hmm.

101. Yeah, no. Yes.

You can go ahead and give him
some Tylenol. Thanks.

N-Not the... no. Not the grape.
He likes the cherry.

Yeah, the cherry one, please.
Look, I gotta go.

[Engine starts]

[Intense music]

[Door shuts]

[Eerie music]

Bill, they are not paying you
enough for these hours.

Or did the parking trolls
get you again?

Someone moved my car.

Left it back at the office.

I don't understand.
Who would do that?

[Keys jingling]

Someone with a spare key.

You made me miss
a drinks meeting with Marty,

my boss,
the guy who decides tenure!

I don't know what you're talking
about, but you know,

the boys are sleeping.

So if you could just
keep your voice down...

Did you move it?

You know it really took me
a long time to get jc...

Did you move my car?

What, move your car?

-Of course not.
-There.

There it is.

A 1000 watts of blinding light,

smile that hooks anyone
not paying attention!


-Did you move my car?
-What did I just say?

Except, you were smiling
when you said it, bitch.

We both know what that means!

Did you move my goddamn car?

And why would I do
something like that?

Can you think of any reason? Hm?

[Intense music]

[Bill breathing heavily]

[Intense music]

[Keys jingling]

[Music continues]

Yes.

[Intense music]

[Indistinct commentary on TV]

[Music continues]

[Melanie clears throat]

Congratulations, Mr. McGuire.

You are officially a co-owner

of a four-bedroom,
three-bath residence

in Warren county.

To the future.

[Eerie music]

Man!

Hope we're not in
over our heads.

Well, there's no going back now.

What's done is done.

[Music continues]

[Metal detector buzzing]

[Intense music]

[Indistinct chatter]

We found a head
and upper torso, chief.

Yeah, they-they have to belong
to the legs

that washed up last week.

Same brand of suitcase.
Kenneth Cole.

Probably one of those
luggage sets.

Yeah, he working on it.

Almost done. Copy that.

My god!

Who does this
to another human being?

[Intense music]

[Doorbell ringing]

-Mr. Cappararo?
-Yes.

I'm detective Stanyan with the
Woodbridge police department.

Is your step-daughter
Melanie here?

Yeah, she is. Can I tell her
what this is about?

We should talk inside, sir.

-All right. Come on.
-I went to her house.

The cleaning lady told me
she was here.

Uh, please. This is my wife
Linda, my daughter Melanie.

-I'm detective Stanyan. Hi.
-Hi.

-Do you mind if I sit?
-Yeah.

I think it would be better
if the children weren't here.

Okay, well, now you're getting
me worried, detective.

Uh, boys, can you go with, um...
Mom, can you take them?

-Yeah. Come on, come on, guys.
-Go with grandma.

Want some ice cream?

Leave the balls there.

[Door shuts]

There's no easy way
to say this, ma'am.

Your husband, bill McGuire,
was found dead in Virginia.

Oh, my god.

I know he'd been
reported missing.

His friends, Jon and Susan rice,
identified the body for us.

From the water?
W-W-What? What, did he drown?

-How did he die?
-Wish I could elaborate.

But we're not leading
this investigation.

This is Virginia beach's case.

They'll be reaching out to you
shortly.

-Honey.
-Oh, oh...

this isn't happening.

-I'm so sorry, ma'am.
-My god!

Are the boys in the other room?

I know. I'm so sorry.

[Intense music]

compassionate leave.

-A month or two.
-No.

I'll have hr clear it.

I-I want to work.

It'll keep me sane. You're here.

I-I can't believe he's dead.

All this time I thought
he was just off

binging with his girlfriend
in Atlantic city.

We were supposed to move in
to our new house next week.

Uh, I...

I don't even wanna go there.

-You just bought it.
-With bill.

I'm just gonna stay
with my parents

until I figure out
what I'm gonna do.

Oh, my god!

I can only imagine
what you're going through.

I mean, even if things
weren't good at the end,

you guys have history together,
you have memories.

You need to grieve.

So if you wanna take a break
from us,

I mean, I completely understand.

No.

No. You-you don't get it.

I was divorcing him.

[Dramatic music]

A lawyer isn't needed, by the
way. This is not adversarial.

Oh, Judy's just
my divorce attorney.

I only asked her to be here
as an extra set of ears.

All right, Ms. McGuire,

if I could start
with the last time you saw bill.

Yeah, um, April 28th,
in the early morning,

around 4:00 or 5:00
is when he walked out on us.

-On you and your children?
-Yes.

And this was at the house
at 2902 Plaza drive?

Right, yes.
We'd just had a fight.

The fight noted in
the temporary restraining order

that you filed two days later?

He got physical,
it wasn't the first time,

but I was worried about what
might happen when he came back.

-Physical meaning violent?
-Yes.

You did the right thing, ma'am.
Too many women wait.

So had he not died,
bill would be coming back

to divorce papers?
That was your intention?

I retained duty right after
the restraining order.

Okay, so just so I'm clear,

the fight that led you
to end the marriage

took place the day after
you and your husband

closed on
the Warren county property.

Yeah. Ridiculous timing, I know.

Huh, that's a beautiful house.

I mean, it's like a dream home,
really.

-Not bill's.
-You talked him into it?

Oh, that's what
the fight was about.

Bill had a gambling problem.

I loved this house,
but mostly I thought

real estate was a good way
to lock up our money.

-So that bill couldn't touch it.
-Okay. Right.

we need to search your home.

Great.

[Instrumental music]

You own a Kenneth Cole
luggage set, Ms. McGuire?

Uh, I do. I did.

Uh, I don't know, I think bill
took it with him when he left.

I don't know
if it's Kenneth Cole,

but it's maybe something
name brand.

Ms. McGuire, this, this laptop,
yours or bill's?

It's both of ours, we shared it.

-May we take it for a few days?
-Yeah, of course.

what else they want from me.

I have answered their questions.

I've bent over backwards
trying to help them.

And now they're just buzzing
around the house like bees.

Okay, don't take it personal,
they're just doing their job.

they're checking their boxes.

They have to look at the spouse.

That is an awful feeling.

It'll pass.
Just tell them everything.

-What's everything?
-[Michael] Anything relevant.

-Full cooperation.
-Oh...

Well, what if it's not relevant,
but they might think it is?

Mn-mn. This doesn't sound good.

Remember how bill had a felony
for perjury?

Yeah, the whole
speeding-ticket thing?

He wouldn't have passed
a background check,

so he asked me
to get it for him.

Just pestered me about it
for months,

so finally I just gave in.

Get what, sweetheart?

A gun.

Uh, he wouldn't leave it alone,
you know, especially once

he knew we were moving,
he thought we needed

protection out there.

-What kind of gun?
-Well, I don't, I don't know.

I don't know a gun
from a can of paint, pop.

Whatever he told me to get.
A-A pistol.

-Okay, where is it now?
-The hell if I know.

I gave it to him,
I never saw it again.

Okay, okay, that's fine.
That's fine.

We tell them now.
Get out in front of it.

But the bigger problem
is gonna be when I bought it.

[Intense music]

show me what you got.

at a retailer in Pennsylvania.

A nickel-finish Taurus .38,
one box of wadcutter rounds.

April 26th?
Where is this on our timeline?

Two days before she claims
she last saw the victim.

Ah...

Download me. Where are we?

There's zero evidence
she had plans to leave him.

All her legal moves,
the abuse claim,

the tro,
hiring a divorce lawyer,

occurred immediately
<i>after</i> bill vanished.

Mm, an attempt to back-fill
her narrative.

-Exactly.
-You've got the gun purchase.

Y-You don't have the gun,
though.

She claims
that bill took it with him.

You've one bullet retrieved from
the torso's ribcage,

a wadcutter,
just like the one she purchased.

Unfortunately, it's the most

popular target round
in the country.

And the black garbage bags
found in the suitcases,

they exactly match the bags
from the McGuire kitchen.

Same grade of plastic,
the same factory.

But also the same commonality
problem as the bullets.

They're sold
all over the east coast.

I'm not worried about it.

Now, where are we on DNA?

Nothing at the townhouse,
some very heavy

bleach residue, though.
Somebody cleaned well.

-[Pickell] Not in bill's car.
-You found it?

Thursday. An impound yard
in Atlantic city.

His DNA all over the floor mats.

-Blood?
-Skin fragments.

Most likely tracked in
on someone's shoes.

Good.

I think you should know that,

in person,
I find her convincing.

Steady as she goes
in our interviews.

Well, I find Meryl Streep
convincing.

Sh-she's still an actress.

Gentleman,
our person of interest

just got a lot more interesting.

[Intense music]

[Indistinct chatter]

[Instrumental music]


I know we're grieving,
but I've lost my brother,

so I'm just gonna come out
and say it.

He deserved better.
That service was totally rushed.

know his name.

That was the only time slot
that they had left.

Where were the boys?

They've been through enough.

Bill is their father.

Mom, give us a minute?
Hey, the boys are two and four.

They cry for their daddy every
single night, and I hold them

until it stops.
I was just trying to spare them.

-Bill would've wanted them here.
-I couldn't really ask him.

Now, could I? And since when are
you so concerned about the boys?

You're the aunt
they barely know.

I'm sorry.

God. I'm sorry.
That was not okay.

I'm a single mother
in the middle of a nightmare,

and I'm just trying
to get through it.

It's not over
until they found his killer.

You haven't forgotten
about that, have you?

Because you seem
remarkably uninterested.

The boys and I
need to keep living, Cindy.

I take it back.

Not all of us are grieving,
are we?

[Intense music]

Well, I'm sorry the service
wasn't to your liking.

[Music continues]

-[Knocking on door]
-[Camera clicks]


No police contact
for two months.

Maybe they've moved on.

-You think?
-They should.

They need to,

because I don't how much more
of this I can take.

The waiting is hell.

Some days I just wish
they'd just

get it over with
and arrest me already.

Hey.

It won't come to that,
I promise.

You're innocent,
that's where they'll end up.

Good morning. Thank you.

Dr. Miller. Detective Stanyan,
Woodbridge police department.

-You have a minute?
-What's this about?

I just have a few questions
about Melanie McGuire.

Melanie? That's Dr. Scott's
nurse, mostly.

He may be better qualified
to assist you.

I don't think so, doctor.

[Intense music]

That is a beautiful family.

We need to talk.

[Music continues]

Where are we with motive?
Anything more, Terry?

Uh, we don't need more.
We've got a lover.

The oldest story
in the murder-your-spouse book.

Except there's no evidence
Dr. Miller

planned to divorce his wife.

Maybe she hoped he would.

Or maybe it's something bigger.

-Bigger?
-Deeper.

When Melanie was four,
her dad ditched the fam

for a brand-new life
in California,

then promptly died
of liver cancer.

What?
That made her a sociopath?

Uh, maybe not sociopath,

but everyone has triggers.

my goddamn car?

<i>to the mix.</i>

Okay, wait, wait, wait. No.

We are not maligning the victim.

You know, she says he got rough
with her, but we don't know

that, there's no report of that.

I thought
we're discussing motive.

We are.
A motive that gets a win for us.

coming isn't gonna do that.

Neither is a-a sad,
weepy childhood story. No.

But what will
is a secret lover.

Obsession.

Now, now, the fantasy of
starting a new life with someone

without any of the trappings
of her old one...

I mean,
people can relate to that.

And who of us hasn't dreamt

of doing that
at least at one point?

-Of killing our spouses?
-No, of being free.

Free, totally free,
of-of a mess that we've made.

Okay, Terry. Tell me our story.

-From?
-The night of.

Early morning, actually,
4:30 A.M.,

the suspect claims that...

Defendant.

Uh, we haven't charged her yet.

Well, let's just try it on
for size.


Right.

The morning
the defendant claims,

in court filings
and police interviews,

she had a fight with the victim
and feared for her life.

Well, ladies and gentleman
of the jury,

I regret to inform you,
there was no fight.

The night he and Melanie
closed on their dream home

and celebrated with wine,
she killed him in cold blood.

And bill never saw it coming.

How could he know
that two weeks earlier,

<i>the defendant</i>
<i>was on her home computer</i>

<i>conducting Internet searches</i>
<i>on how to sedate someone?</i>

<i>before that night</i>

<i>she drove to a Pennsylvania gun</i>
<i>store where she would purchase</i>

<i>a .38 caliber Taurus revolver</i>
<i>she would use to kill him?</i>

How could he know
that just one day before,

<i>she forged her lover's</i>
<i>signature and handed over</i>

<i>a fraudulent prescription</i>
<i>of 500 milliliters</i>

<i>of chloral hydrate syrup</i>
<i>to a pharmacist?</i>

<i>How could he know</i>

<i>that when he closed his eyes</i>
<i>that night,</i>

<i>drugged from the altered wine</i>
<i>she had given him...</i>

<i>That he'd sleep</i>
<i>just long enough for her</i>

<i>to drop the kids off</i>
<i>at preschool...</i>

<i>And return to end his life?</i>

[Intense music]

How could he know

that he would never...


Wake up?


Can I say something?

-Yes, Anne?
-So far the townhouse is clean.

They did a luminol search
and they didn't find anything.

No blood in the bathroom,
no blood on the, on the couch.

I'm having a team
from the outside

come and do a deeper dig.

Yeah, but what if

the crime scene
proves to be somewhere else?

It won't.
And we don't want it to.

No, no, the townhouse
is a better story.

Okay, keep going, Terry.

Uh, from the shooting.
He's dead on the couch.

So now Melanie
has a body to dispose of.

<i>in the morning, the kids are</i>

<i>in school, her folks have</i>
<i>agreed to pick</i>

<i>them up from school</i>
<i>and keep them that night.</i>

<i>So now Melanie has two days</i>

<i>to get bill into the suitcases</i>
<i>and clean up her mess.</i>

[Garbage bags rustling]

[Intense music]

[Machine whirring]

She did a good job on the house.
Perfect, in fact.

But she forgot about her shoes.

<i>When she dumped bill's car</i>
<i>in Atlantic city</i>

<i>to throw investigators</i>
<i>off her scent,</i>

<i>she tracked tiny skin fragments</i>
<i>from her butchering</i>

all over the floor mats.

I-I don't like "skin fragments."
It's too-too clinical.

I know, let's say

human sawdust.

I like that. I like that.

Human sawdust.

I think we're ready.

[School bell ringing]

Now, remember,
use your listening ears

for Ms. Gail today, okay?

-Okay.
-All right. I love you, baby.

And, uh, ahma and poppop are
gonna pick you up after school.

-Okay? Have a good day.
-You, too.

-Bye.
-Bye.

[Intense music]

[Indistinct radio chatter]

Melanie McGuire,
put your hands on your head,

interlace your fingers.

-Do you have any weapons on you?
-No.

You have the right
to remain silent.

Anything you say
can and will be used against you

in a court of law. You have
the right to an attorney.

You cannot afford one, the court
will provide one for you.

Do you understand these rights
you've just heard?

-Yeah.
-Let's go.

how are you pleading?

Not guilty, you honor.

Let the record show
that the defendant has pled

not guilty
to the arresting charge of

first-degree murder
of William McGuire.

Counsel's request for
a preliminary hearing is denied.

Bail is set at $750,000.

[Intense music]

Yes, this is Michael Cappararo.
I do all my banking with you.

Can I speak to a loan officer,
please?

I wanna take out
a second mortgage on my house.

No, no, no, I'll hold. I need
to speak with him right away.

<i>The arrest of Melanie McGuire</i>
<i>represents a 13-month effort</i>

<i>to bring William McGuire's</i>
<i>killer to justice.</i>

<i>Now, forget the prurient</i>
<i>headlines, this young man</i>

<i>was the father of two,</i>
<i>who served his country,</i>

<i>and I will forcefully</i>
<i>honor his life</i>

<i>with our actions in court.</i>

<i>We haven't decided if we will</i>
<i>seek the death penalty,</i>

<i>but the rank barbarity</i>
<i>of this crime</i>

<i>certainly puts it in play.</i>

<i>No, that's-that's all for now.</i>

-[Linda] Michael!
-[Kids screaming]

They're perfectly... Michael!

-[Indistinct chatter]
-[Kids screaming]

-No, they're gonna be fine.
-Hey, hey, what's going on here?

-No, no.
-They're taking the kids.

-Michael!
-No...

[Indistinct chatter]

-We have to take the children.
-No.

They're gonna stay with us.
They're gonna stay with us.

-They're fine here.
-No, honey, no. Hey.

It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get 'em back.

-We're gonna get 'em back.
-No, it's not okay.

-It's okay, honey... guys.
-It's not okay.

Hey, we'll see you soon, okay?

Be good. Be good boys.

[Door buzzing]

[Instrumental music]

look at her.


Oh, sweetie. Oh, my goodness.
Oh, good to see you.

-How'd you come up with it, pop?
-I moved some things around.

-It's no big deal.
-No, he moved mountains.

-Um...
-It's just money.

We gotta get to the custody
hearing, it's in 15 minutes.

-No way we'll make it, sweetie.
-Well, not if we don't move.

-Give me the keys.
-Okay.

Come on!

Upon the completion
of their physical

and psychiatric evaluations,

both McGuire children are
to be placed in the custody of...

-Excuse me, excuse me!
-Bailiff!

No, Iâ€™m-I'm their mother.

You're late, and you will ask
permission to address this court

or be sent out.

Permission to address the court,
your honor.


-No.
-Quickly.

for a crime I did not commit,

and my boys need their mother.

I have no, uh,
prior criminal history.

Ms. McGuire, this is
an emergency hearing,

and as such,
when you retain counsel,

you will have avenues
to contest my ruling.

-Yes, but, your honor, i-i...
-I'm speaking, Ms. McGuire.

Now, given
the extraordinary gravity

of the criminal action
against you

and given the allegations
of child neglect

by family members
through their counsel,

the court has no other choice
but to revoke custody.

So at this time
the court hereby assigns

emergency sole guardianship
to Jack and Jason's aunt,

Ms. Cindy Ligosh.

[Intense music]

Next case.

[Indistinct chatter]

are lying

to family services about me.

I can petition
for supervised visits,

but a social worker
has to be there.

Brad.

I'm here.

<i>TV? They know about us.</i>

It's all over the news.
Charla's not talking to me.

No surprise there.

The RMA fired me today.

Oh, Brad, uh, I'm so sorry.

The detectives called me.

-They wanna meet with me again.
-About what?

<i>They think I'm your accomplice.</i>

For something
that didn't happen?

I know, uh...

Yeah, they're just trying
to scare me.

They said on the day
you bought the gun,

we were on the phone
for a hundred minutes.

You know what that looks like?

Well, we did nothing wrong.

So you'd tell me, right?

I mean,
if you had anything to do with

what happened to bill,
you'd tell me?

I already have.

Just say it again.

On my children's lives,
a thousand times over,

absolutely nothing.

I know. I know. Thank you.

What's going on?

Nothing. No, nothing.

to hear it again.

I gotta go, okay? I'll-I'll
check in with you later.

-[Melanie]<i> I love you.</i>
-I love you, too.

[Clears throat]

you're thinking. Why me?

The easy answer is you're
the lover of a murder suspect,

who we believe had help.

But another way
to think of it is

you're in a position
to help her.

Could be we're way off.
What you get from her proves it.

You're way off.

I hope so, Dr. Miller.

I really do.

[Instrumental music]

Number two.

Ten dollars.

Thank you.

[Cell phone ringing]

Hello? Hi, yeah.

Yes. Thank you.

[Dramatic music]

Come in. Come in.

Joe Tacopina.
Can I call you Melanie?

-Please do.
-Please have a seat.

Thank you.

Can we get you anything?
Water? Coffee?

No, thank you.

I must say, you've got
quite the advocate

in Selene Trevizas.

She was relentless.

Yeah, that's Selene,
uh, even when I told her

I couldn't possibly afford you.

Ah, let's not worry about that
now. We'll figure it out.

This is Stephen Turano,
he's licensed in New Jersey,

so he'll be my co-counsel.

-Good to meet you.
-Hi.

What they're doing to you,
Melanie, is appalling.

Prosecutors are bullies,

but prezioso
is her own sadistic breed.

Well, it's time she met me.

I tear bullies to shreds.

So let's get to work, shall we?

-Yeah.
-Good.

Take me to the last time
you saw bill McGuire.

Um, well, we had just closed

on the Warren county house.
I was ecstatic.

<i>I was determined to celebrate,</i>

<i>so I opened up</i>
<i>a nice bottle of wine.</i>

<i>We finished it.</i>

<i>But it didn't relax bill</i>
<i>at all.</i>

She's unbelievable!


Bill. Bill.

Hey, calm...


It's 4:00 in the morning.

How many times have I said
I don't wanna see

dryer sheets in this house?

They're for lazy people! You
ever hear of fabric softener?

Oh, god.

Your problem is
you don't listen!

How many times did I say
I don't want this house?

Five-hundred-thousand dollars
is gonna wreck us!

-What are you doing?
-I'm cleaning up.

Leave it!

Goddammit! I said leave it!

-[Indistinct yelling]
-Don't touch me! Don't...

Oh, you wanna clean it?
You wanna, you wanna clean it?

I got just the place for it.
How about this?

-No.
-Open your mouth. Mm?

Yeah, just swallow. Exactly.

Good, right? Yeah, swallow.

-No!
-Swallow.

-[Groans]
-Swallow it all the way.




Oh. Baby.

[Indistinct chatter]

Come here.

No, it's okay.

Open the door.

-[Bangs]
-Open the goddamn door!


-[Banging on door]
-[Shushing]

It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.


-Ah!
-I know, it's okay. It's okay.

That must've been very scary.

What happened next?

<i>in the bathroom.</i>

<i>I could hear him packing.</i>

[Door opens]

<i>Then I heard</i>
<i>the garage door open.</i>

Right here. Shh, shh, shh...

[Engine starts]

[Engine revving]

<i>He sped away.</i>

<i>And that's the last time</i>
<i>I ever saw him.</i>

<i>killed your husband?</i>


I don't know, I'm sure
bill had a long list of people

who he pissed off, I...

<i>some bad guys money.</i>

<i>I don't know who did this</i>
<i>to my husband.</i>

Let's turn to the days
immediately after he left.

Prezioso has
your e-zpass records.

Uh, you drove to Atlantic city,

<i>they say, to dump bill's car.</i>

It's okay, this is where we tell
her what she doesn't know

about that trip.
We can do that now, or...

No, no, I don't need any time,
it's just...

It's just embarrassing is all.

Not one of my finest moments.
Just dumb.

<i>I went to Atlantic city</i>
<i>to look for bill's car.</i>

<i>Once I found it,</i>
<i>I moved it with my spare key.</i>

I drove it to another casino
few miles down the road.

You know, "good luck
finding your car, you jerk."

But at the time, I, um...

<i>I'd been taking Xanax.</i>

<i>I had taken a few that night.</i>

<i>I was in no condition</i>
<i>to be driving home.</i>

So I took a cab home.

And then you took, uh,
another cab right back?

Yeah, well, by the time
I got back to Woodbridge,

I was feelin' better.

And I needed my car,
so I went back for it.

Just so we're clear, that's
another two hours in a cab,

for a total of four hours,

the combined fares
close to, what, $500?

-Yeah.
-For a prank?

For my hide-a-car revenge, yes.

I mean, I'd done it before.

I could tell you a better story,
but it wouldn't be true.

You also called e-zpass billing

to try to get the charges erased
on this trip.

Right. After they started
investigating me.

Pfft. I was worried
how it'd make me look.

Oh. No kidding.

Stephen, let's remember,

they have the burden of proof,
not us.

Their story has to be perfect,
not hers.

Know what our client is?

Consistent.

A year's worth of police
transcripts and recordings,

and she never wavers.

-That tells a jury she's honest.
-[Scoffs]

Hell, uh, even her boyfriend
couldn't shake her.

Janice.

[Melanie on recording]
<i>Well, we did nothing wrong.</i>

[Brad on recording]<i> So you'd</i>
<i>tell me, right? I mean...</i>

<i>If you had anything to do</i>
<i>with what happened to bill...</i>

<i>-You'd tell me.</i>
-[Melanie]<i> I already have.</i>


<i>lives, a thousand times over,</i>

<i>absolutely nothing.</i>

Are you okay, Melanie?
Can we get you a-a water?

[Intense music]

[Dramatic music]

A wiretap, ladies and gentlemen,

is a weapon of choice
for lazy prosecutors.

detectives used Dr. Miller

to question her by proxy,

<i>forcing the man</i>
<i>she trusted most</i>

to catch her
at her most vulnerable,

without the benefit of counsel.

Remember, Ms. Prezioso
maintains, without evidence,

<i>that Dr. Miller was Melanie's</i>

<i>entire motive</i>
<i>for killing her husband.</i>

And yet I ask you,

where on those many tapes

<i>recorded during</i>
<i>raw and intimate moments</i>

<i>does my client admit</i>
<i>or even imply,</i>

she had anything to do

with bill McGuire's death?

Nowhere.

Even as Dr. Miller

pressed her over and over
for the confession

Ms. Prezioso
so desperately wanted...

While Dr. Miller was making
those recordings,

he was still seeing my client.

<i>He was still trusting her,</i>
<i>he was still loving her,</i>

<i>despite everything these</i>
<i>detectives were telling him.</i>

Those recordings
only exonerate my client.

They show the true,
the unguarded Melanie McGuire.

Imperfect? Yes.

Seeking refuge from a cruel
and violent husband...

-[Indistinct yelling]
-Don't touch me! Don't...

But a depraved killer?

No way.

Never.

So let's be done with all this.

We can grieve the victim,
and we absolutely should.

But, members of the jury,
I ask you,

end this persecution
of an innocent woman.

Melanie McGuire is not guilty

of this crime.

Allow her to get on
with her life.

Allow her to go home
to her children.

Thank you.

I gotta be honest,

keeping up with the defendant's
fantastical account

over the past two years
has been a full-time job.

But, thankfully,

she can't lie her way
out of DNA.

Can't spin the human sawdust
she tracked into bill's car

after cutting him to pieces.

You need nothing more
to convict her,

but there's even more,

and you have it in abundance,

starting with the fact
that there was no fight.

In the early hours
of April 28th, 2004,

there was no fight.

No, bill never sped off
in his car.

No, instead,
he lay in a stupor...

<i>From the chloral hydrate</i>

<i>that the autopsy found</i>
<i>in his bloodstream.</i>

Incapacitated...

By the date-rape drug
that Melanie used to poison him.

[Intense music]

What happened next took two days

and it, it is not
for the faint of heart.


[Intense music]

[Machine whirring]

[Music continues]

[Machine whirring]

A seven-hour drive, now just

think about that,
ladies and gentlemen.


with her husband
stuffed into suitcases

in the back of her SUV.

Did she reflect in horror
on what she had done?

<i>Uh, show any remorse</i>
<i>whatsoever?</i>

No, her actions tell us
that she did not,

because Melanie's last act
that night

was to throw out
the father of her children...

Like she was throwing out
the trash.

[Water splashes]

of the jury,

the defense and the prosecution
have rested.

You've heard my instructions.

You're hereby dismissed
to begin deliberations.

Please follow the bailiff.

[Gavel bangs]

So?

They're drowning
in reasonable doubt.

Acquittal, no question.

[Intense music]

[Instrumental music]

Hi, Melanie.

Alice Davis.
Thank you for having us.

Yeah. Of course.

<i>I just hope the jury does</i>
<i>the right thing for Billy.</i>

<i>so hard for him,</i>

<i>for us, for justice.</i>


It's day two
of jury deliberations.

You're out on bail,
a free woman,

staring at the very real
prospect of life in prison.

-The waiting must be...
-Agony.

-Yeah.
-What's going through your mind?

Patti told a good story.

Hell, if it were a movie,
I'd watch it.

<i>Melanie has been lying about</i>
<i>my brother for two years,</i>

<i>and now this trial</i>
<i>has been seven weeks</i>

<i>of nothing</i>
<i>but lies, lies, lies.</i>

<i>And it's time for a verdict of</i>
<i>guilty to finally shut her up.</i>

Joe Tacopina told a story...

He told the truth.

A version that, quite frankly,
many people

are having trouble believing.

Well, let's hope the 12 people
who matter the most

are smarter than that.

<i>I feel most for her parents,</i>
<i>Linda and Michael,</i>

<i>who I've always adored.</i>

<i>She's put them</i>
<i>in an impossible position.</i>

<i>What kind of a person</i>

Even with all of our problems,
I desperately wanted bill

to be found safe and alive.

<i>For weeks after Billy vanished,</i>
<i>I begged,</i>

<i>begged her to go with me</i>

<i>to pressure the police there,</i>
<i>to make phone calls</i>

<i>She refused.</i>

<i>And that told me everything.</i>

<i>It should tell you everything,</i>

Finally, let me ask you
about Dr. Miller.

He assisted
in the effort to convict you.

-Do you hold it against him?
-No. No, they threatened him.

And he knew
I couldn't incriminate myself.

If you could do it
all over again,

would you still have the affair?

I don't know.

Do you still love him?

I did.

What do you think
happened to bill?

Do you really think
he ran afoul of the mob?

I mean, it certainly fits.

Got money on the street in ac,

that's how you get bullets
here and here.

of the verdict,

when this program airs,
viewers are going to hear

claims from you that
are impossible to corroborate.

Why should our audience
trust you?

I have no control over that.

But I know that I'm innocent.

Thank you.

Thank you, everyone. We're done.

Yeah.

You know, I'm sure
that you get this a lot,

but you have
an incredible smile.

Uh, bill used to say that to me.

"A thousand watts
of blinding light," he'd say.

But outbursts
