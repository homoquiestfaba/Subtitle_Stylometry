We have been trying

and it has been booked solid!

This superhost,
username BettyLou52,

has a nearly spotless record.
Mm-hmm.

Endless reviews
saying how staying here

has been "breathtaking."

"Breathtaking.
"Absolutely marvelous."

One user even described it
as "life-changing."

"Life-changing."

Are you ready

They finally had an opening,

so I am really excited.
Me too!

It is gonna be
such a memorable stay,

and we are checking in...

Right now.

Okay. Cut.

Ah. I think that worked.
Yeah, it was fine.

We can just throw in some
reactions over the boring parts.

Yeah.

Hey, can you order a hard drive
to the house?

Yeah, I can.

I think I'm gonna shower
before we go.

Sounds good.
Hey.

You want to join me?
Really?

Nah.
[LAUGHS]

[WATER RUNNING]

Hey, babe!


What's up, guys?

Okay. This week's episode

[VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES]

So quiet here.

Okay. First impressions.

Babe, give me a heads-up.
Still got road hair.

Come on. Think fast.
First impressions.

[EXHALES SHARPLY] Okay.
Wah!

Come on, DiCaprio.

Okay. Uh, my first impressions
of this place is just the...

Okay. Cut the shit.

What?

That felt fake. Do it over.

Okay. Fine.

[EXHALES SHARPLY] Okay.

Do you want to start off
with the shot of the house?

Mm-hmm. Got it.

What are you doing?

Holy crap! This is insane!

Oh, my G-o-o-o-od!

You're the worst.



This is why
we're losing subscribers.

Ouch.


Got a pretty good feeling
about this video.


Could be on a hot streak
again soon.

Whew. Let's hope so.

Place looks so nice.

[HINGES CREAK]
All right.

2-3-4-2.


...4-2.

[BEEPING]
Shit.

Not working?
No.

Here.

"First arrive..."
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.

Front-door code... 2-3-4-2.

Yeah, I tried that.
Well, shit.

That's what I said.
Do you have the host's number?

Can you call them?
Yeah, it's in our messages,

but it's not loading.

No. Look. It's right here.
Oh.

Let me get a better signal.

[KEYPAD DIALING]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

It's ringing!

[LINE RINGING]

It's ringing.

[CLICK, DIAL TONE]

It's not ringing anymore!

Here we go. Second impressions.
Second impressions. Yeah.

Well, the outside is terrific,

but we got the wrong door code,
so I don't know if we'll ever

see the inside.

Good energy, but just give me
something we can use.

Yeah. Uh...

Okay. Got something.

My second impressions.

What?

Teddy, what?

[GASPS]
Hi, there!

Thanks for the warning.

You must be BettyLou52.

It's actually Rebecca.

Oh, so you're neither
Betty nor Lou.

I'm Claire.
Yeah!

I never know what to use
on those sites, you know?

Do I use my real name
and invite strangers

to know too much about me
or do I use something random?

Uh, we tried calling.
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

The service out here
is spotty.

I got a notification
on the camera,

saw you guys sitting out here.

Yeah, well, the door code
didn't work, so...

Oh, pbht! I totally forgot!

I had to change it
after the last guests

tried to stay longer
than they were supposed to.

Right. [CHUCKLES]
I mean, who can blame them?


Ahh!

Anyway, I can let you guys in,
give you a new code.

Yeah. Thanks.
Sure.

Oh. Thank you.
[GIGGLES]

â™ªâ™ª


I'm sorry again about the code.

I don't normally
have to change it after people.

Thanks for understanding.

Those last guests,
let me tell you.

New code is 8-5-8-7.

8-5-8-7.

[BEEPING]
Thanks.

[KEYPAD BEEPING, BEEPING STOPS]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Wow.

Ditto.

The alarm code
is the same as the front door.

Do you need me to write it down?
8-5-8-7. Got it.

Restroom?
Down there to the right.

Oh, my God. We are here.
And it is gorgeous.

Say hello to the superhost.

No!

Um...

I-I had messaged you when
we booked about what we do.

We do that travel vlog
called "Superhost"

where we stay at and review
vacation rentals.

Ohh! Pbht! Of course!

Sorry.
It's been such a busy season.

I thought you were next week.

I-If you don't mind,
of course.

We've never had any problems
with it before, so...

No. No, it's fine.
It's fine. Yeah.

And you're still okay
with being on camera for it?

Yeah! [GIGGLES]

For sure. Whatever you need.

I just want to make sure
this trip is unforgettable.

Hey, so, the, uh, toilet
over there isn't flushing.

Oh. That's weird.

Um, I am really sorry.

I can come back later
with some tools.

I don't have anything on me.
Oh. Yeah. That's totally fine.

I'm just glad
it was just a number one.



Hmm. Well, I don't want to
get in the way of your trip.

Wouldn't want
to get a bad review!

I'll come back tomorrow
to fix the toilet.

If there is anything
you need before then,

shoot me a text.

Will do.

[DOOR CLOSES ]

She sure is something.

â™ªâ™ª

What's up, guys?!
We finally settled in,

and we want to give you
a quick tour around this place.

This room is beautiful.

It was featured the most
on the site for good reason.

Look how big these windows are!
[BOING! BOING!]

[SLIDE WHISTLE!]

And welcome
to the very rustic kitchen.

Check out this little number.
An authentic cabin stove!

Looks a bit like
a "Hansel and Gretel" situation.

Like, maybe you could
fit in there, Teddy.

I would cook me in here.

Oh, it's very filthy, though.
Yes, it is.

And here we have
the master bedroom.

With exactly
zero window covering!

Seems like we'll be getting up
very early in the morning,

which I love, as you guys know.

[ZAPPING]
Ooh. How is it?

Very soft.
Great.

And what vacation rental
would be complete without...

one of these?
Ooh!

I gotta see it.
[GASPS] No, Teddy.

I have to!
Tell my parents I love them!

No, Teddy! No!
Okay.

It was close.

So, one thing we noticed.

Security cameras everywhere.
I mean, places like this

usually have
a security camera or two,

but it just seems
a little bit overboard here.

Another one.
[WHOOSH]

Another one there.

And what do we have here,
Teddy?

We have my favorite room
in the house.

A cat room! With everything
that you need as a cat!

He's so strange.

But I haven't seen a cat yet.
Have you?

[EXPLOSION, CAT MEOWS]

Teddy.
[KEYBOARD CLACKS]

What?
You like cats.

Okay. Apart from that,
what do you think?

It feels slow.

Really? W-Which part?
Every part.

Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

Babe.

Just lose the cat-room bit
and upload it.

[CLAIRE SIGHS]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[DOOR SLIDES]

â™ªâ™ª

It's uploading.

And the Internet is very slow.

Mm-hmm.

Hey, I know how hard you've
been working on this channel.


But we're gonna have
a great series here.

I know it.
Our numbers are dropping.

What if we've peaked?
And that's it?

Then...

at least we've peaked together.


Yeah.

You're so corny.

I know.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª


â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[WIND CHIME RINGING SOFTLY]

Hey.
Jesus.

Babe. What are you doing,
sneaking up on me like that?

I called your name
from the stairs.

What are you doing?

I thought I saw something
out there.

What? Where?

Out there.

It looked like
they were staring back at me.

Maybe you just saw an animal
or something.

Teddy, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Let's go back to bed.

We have a lot to do tomorrow.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

What's up, guys?
Day two of our trip here!

Claire is still sleeping.
Let's go say hi.

[GROANS]
Good morning, sunshine.

No. Good night.

Aww. We've missed you.
I've missed you.

No, you haven't.

We had a bit of a late night,

but we're ready
for day-two adventures!

So don't forget
to smash that "like" button

and subscribe to our videos.
Anything to add, Claire?

Why is it so bright in here?!


Too early, dude.
I know.

[PHONE UNLOCKS]

Shit.

What?
Shit!

What?
Check your phone.

Wait. How did this happen?

I bet it was
"That Bitch in Draper."

I mean, it could have been
a bot auto-flagging

or something.
We... We can dispute it.

It's not a mistake!
Does it say which video?

The whole channel's down.

Of course. No service.


Gotcha.

[LINE RINGING]

Hello. You've reached

the Partnership Program
support line.

[KEYPAD BEEPS]
Please wait while we

connect you
to the next available agent.

Hi! How ya doin'?

Hey! Yeah, I-I'm good.

Just here to fix the toilet.

Oh. Oh, thanks. Thank you.

Is the place treating you well,
like, outside of that?

I would really... hate
to get a bad review.

Oh. Yeah, yeah. It's great.

I'm actually just
trying to make a call,

but Teddy's upstairs.

Perfect. [GIGGLES]
I'll check it out.

Okay.

[MUZAK PLAYING, CLICK]

Hello. My name is Brad,
and thanks for holding.

Can I get your
account number, please?

What's up, guys? Teddy here.

It is day two, and I only
have a couple of minutes,

but I wanted to quickly give you
an update on the proposal.

The current plan is, tomorrow
morning, I'm gonna take her

to this super-pretty spot
that one of our fans sent us...

thank you so much...
and do the deed.

And don't worry...
I'm gonna film

the whole thing secretly
the entire time

so you can all enjoy.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

All right. Gotta run. Ciao.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Hey, Teddy!
Oh. Hey.

I really should have checked
before I used it.

It happens.

We get issues with the septic
tank from time to time.

Don't have the pressure
you guys have.


It's usually nothing.

But sometimes things
get stuck in here.

It's this low season
right now,

so sometimes these things
don't get used

to keep them
working properly.



Shit.

I'm gonna have to
get somebody out here.

That's fine.
We'll just use the other one.

I really hope this doesn't
affect your review.

Oh, no. Believe me,
this place is great.

You have nothing
to worry about.

Hey.

How did it go?

I spent all that time verifying
the account information,

and then,
I dropped the call.

I kind of like this place
can't win right now.

No, you have nothing
to do with it.

Are you sure?

[VOICES FADING]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

If there's anything I can do,
please don't hesitate.

And again,
I am so sorry.

Thank you.

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

So...

what you want
to do now?

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

What are we doing
up here?

We make these stupid videos that
nobody's even watching anymore.

People are watching.
We're bleeding subscribers.

What's the point?

I... like making these
with you.

Do you like asking your parents
for help to pay rent?

They don't mind.
That's not the point.

We used to be able to...

pay our own bills.

We've gotten away from
what worked for us.

"The Bitch from Draper"
was massive.

Yeah, but that was so
clickbait-y.

No one likes that.
It got eyeballs.

I guess.

We should get back.


[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

What?

Teddy, what?

Hi, there.

My second impression.

What?

Teddy, what?

My second impression.

What?

Teddy, what?

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

My second impression.

Hey, I'm gonna
head up.

Okay.

I'll be up
in a minute.

Okay.

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

Teddy, what?

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[UNIDENTIFIED NOISE]

[UNIDENTIFIED NOISE]

Did you hear that?

What time is it?
Shh.

There's nothing.

Just go back to sleep.

[UNIDENTIFIED NOISE]

Someone's inside
the house.

What do you mean
someone's ins...

[UNIDENTIFIED NOISE]

What do we do?

I don't know.

What if it's Rebecca?

What if it's not?

I'm calling
the police.

Shit. No service.

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

Did you set the alarm?

Yeah.

Go check.

What?

Just go make sure.

Are you serious?

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

Check the living room.

Hello?

[UNIDENTIFIED TALKING]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

Hello?

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[WATER BUBBLING]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

Well?

Toilet's fixed.

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

Good morning.
Jesus!

Sorry. I was hoping to be done
before you got up.

I know. I know.

I just couldn't sleep
last night,

because I kept
thinking about

how things kept going wrong
for you guys,

and I didn't want another day
to get off on the wrong foot.

So, I stopped
at the store,

and I ended up getting
a few other things,

and then one thing
led to another.

Yeah, I...
I totally get it.

I'm just about done, and then,
I'll be out of your hair.

Won't happen again.

Okay.

Coffee's almost ready.

What's up?

Rebecca made us breakfast.

What did she make?

How do you not smell
the food.

You don't go
downstairs thinking

that you're gonn...
you know, someone's gonna...

I don't know.
I thought it was a candle.

When did she come in?

I don't...
I don't know.

I just came down,
half naked.


It was humiliating.

I'm just glad I was wearing
underwear.

It's amazing.

No, it was terrible,
it what that was.

Well, even though
she gave you a fright,

she made us some damn
good pancakes.

Yeah.

Hey, thanks for breakfast.

You are so welcome.

Okay, I am [INDISTINCT].

Okay, so,
not gonna lie,

so far, this trip has been
pretty interesting.

It's been a doozy.

First of all, our channel
got demonetized...

By accident. Not our fault.
Right.

But then, you think
you come out this far

to get away from
all those crazy people,

but then, you get
to this house,

and you realize that the host
might actually be crazier

than the people
you were escaping in the f...

What?
I mean,

we shouldn't talk
about the...

What do you mean?

I think she can hear us.

Can't we just turn it off?

Probably.

But let's just film
someplace else.

This room looks the best.

Yeah, it does.

Okay. Let me...

find a ladder.
Okay.

I'm gonna cut.

Careful.

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

It was you.

You reported us,
didn't you?

You ruined everything.

Ruined what?

Ever since you came out
with your bullshit video...

Jesus.
What's wrong with you?

...no one will stay there.
I have to sell the place.

Oh, so, what's your plan?

You drive three hours to,
what, beat me up?

Let's just calm down,
and talk about this.

What is going on here?

Who are you?

Are you the owner?

I said, "Who are you?"

You better watch out
for these two.

They're snakes.

they'll make up a bunch of lies
about you, and ruin your life.

Look at what she did
to your house.

Did you do that?

I couldn't help it.

I saw them up there,
and I...

These two,
they came into my home,

and they destroyed
my entire business.

So, you came here
and broke mywindow.

I know.
I'm sorry about that.

I really am. But...

You don't understand.
I understand just fine.

And if you don't leave now,
I'm calling the police.

These people are not
who they say they are.

You better watch.
Get off my property!

Geez. Alright.
I'm going.

Don't say
I didn't warn you.

Go! Now! Or I swear to God,
I will cut you open!

[CAR DOOR CLOSES]

[CAR DEPARTS]

Well, then.

That was something.


You're...

kind of a badass.

Oh. No.

I just hate what a mess
this trip has been for you guys.

I can't even begin
to imagine

what your video
is gonna be like.

Believe me,
we're having a great time.

Yeah. Her place
was a total shithole,

and she was
a complete psychopath.

Yeah.

Look, I came down to say
I have some time now,

and I'd like to do
that interview.

Really?
Yeah. Sure.

Why not?

Okay.

I can't believe we didn't have
the camera with us.

Sound good?
It sounds great.

I've never done this before,
so it might not be very good.

No, this is gonna be
super easy.

And we're not live, so,
if you flub a line, just stop.

We'll go back.

Hey, this is gonna be fun.

Let's roll, Kim.

Speeding.


Do I look at you,
or at the camera?

Just look at me.

I'm not even here.

Look at you.
Got it.

Alright, Rebecca,
we're gonna start off

with a friendly introduction,
sort of like a,

"Hi, my name is Rebecca
and I'm a superhost."

You can say
something like that.

That would be great.

Hi. My name is Rebecca,
and I'm a superhost.

Awesome. And that smile
at the end was perfect.

Okay, so, we're gonna get into
the real questions now.

And I'm not on camera.
You can't hear or see me.

If you can incorporate
the question into the answers.

Let's say I'm asking you,
"What color is your shirt?"

Instead of saying "red,"
you would say,

"The color of my shirt
is red."

Make sense?
But my shirt is white.

Yeah. So, then,
you would say,

The color of my shirt
is white."

Right?
Yeah.

I think so.

Okay.
Let's... Let's get going.

So, Rebecca, how did you
decide to get into

renting out your house?

For starters,
this isn't really my house.

My father left it to me
when he died.

He owned it with my stepmom,
and when he passed,

she got his house
in South Carolina,

and I got this one.

Oh, wow. I'm...

so sorry to hear that.

But it must be nice
to have a place like this

to remember him by.

Yeah, it's great.

I have a smaller place
not far from here...

much smaller...

so I'm able to
keep an eye on it.

But... it felt wrong
to keep it empty.

So, when all of these
vacation home-sharing websites

started popping up,
I signed up.

Here we are.

That's great.

Any particular experiences
with the rental

that you'd like to share?

You know, maybe someone
that has stayed,

and left a memorable
impression on you?

Yeah.

You know what?

There was this one.

An older couple.

They rented the place for
an entire month over Christmas.

They saw that
I was living alone,

and all of their kids
had kids,

and did their own thing
for the holidays.

So, they invited me in.

And we spent
the holidays together.

Christmas, New Year's,
I was here with them.

It was nice.

It was like I was
their family.

Re... Re...

It is the best holiday
I ever had.

They live back
in South Carolina,

but are just...

...the nicest people.

I...

I think...
I think that's great.

Awesome job.

Oh, if we could get
one final line.

Of course.

Yeah,
this is just a sign-off.

If you can say, "Hi,
my name is Rebecca,"

pause, and then,
with the most enthusiasm

that you can,
finish it off with, you know,

"I am a superhost.

Hi.
My name is Rebecca.

And I am a superhost!

Hi. My name is Rebecca.

And I am a superhost!

That is the craziest shit
I've ever seen.

I knew when we got here.

What do you mean?

This is what people
want to see.

They want to see people
like that... complete lunatics.

We got to get
more of her.

This chick is gold.

Let's watch it again.

Hi. My name is Rebecca.

And I am a superhost!

What's up, guys.

Claire's sleeping right now,
and we have a brand-new episode

that's slowly uploading.

But I wanted to record
a quick update

on the super-top-secret
proposal video.

Also, you should hit
that "like" button.

Don't forget
to subscribe.

So, in the morning,
I'm gonna take her up there.

And the view is supposed
to be spectacular.

That's where
I'm gonna do it.

I thought
I heard her.

Anyway, just wanted to give you
a quick update.

I can't wait to see her face
when she finds out

why we really
came out here.

I should get going.
She's a light sleeper.

But I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

So, Teddy thought it would be
a great idea

to wake up bright
and early,

to go walking in
the middle of nowhere?

To make matters worse, our
upload didn't work last night.

It seems the Internet
is down,

so, who knows if
you'll ever see it.

Yes, but I did write to Rebecca
this morning,

and it should be fixed
by the time we get back.

Yeah, we'll see about that.

Speaking of Rebecca,

I don't think I have ever
seen anything as crazy

as what we witnessed
yesterday.

We're gonna have to shoot some
kind of re-enactment for you,

but basically, she nearly beat
the crap out of that bitch Vera.

Remember her?

Yeah, well,
she drove all the way here,

shows up out of nowhere,
all huffing and puffing.

Come on.
One second.

That's right...
the Bitch from Draper came here,

and threw a rock
at a window.

I mean, we went out there, and
she legit wanted to fight me.

And then, Rebecca, this host,
comes out of nowhere,

goes fully crazy, and that bitch
just hightails it out of here.

Hey. Come on.

Fine.

Party pooper.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Wow.

Yeah.

Okay.

Check out this view
we have here.

This is unbelievable.


Here.

Why don't you
want to film?

What are you doing?

Just...

I just want to look at you
for a moment.

What?

I know how stressed
you've been lately,

and I just want to take
a minute to...

tell you just how much
I appreciate you.

Teddy, I...

One moment.

I've been thinking.
That's never good.

I've been thinking

that you and I have been
doing this show

for a while now.

And we've been together
even longer than that.

And we do
everything together...

everything.

And I just want to continue
doing everything together...

the show... life...

everything.

Teddy...

So, I spoke with your parents
last week.

You did?

Yeah.

Your dad told me
a long time ago

that I had to talk to him
before I got any ideas.

So I did.

I talked to
your mom and dad,

and I asked them
if this was okay.

Claire...

will you marry me?

Yes! Of course!

Yes!

Teddy, you're a genius.

What do you mean?
A secret proposal?

It's perfect.
People love this shit.

Ready?

Oh, my god!

This guy
just proposed to me!

I've never had such
a big surprise in my life!

Claire.
Claire, stop.

What?

You're serious?

Jesus, Ted.

You set the camera up
for it.

I figured it was...
Yeah, I know. That was dumb.

No, it's just...

did you really
talk to my dad?

Teddy!

Teddy.

Teddy, come on.
Let's talk about this.

Nothing to talk about.

I'm sorry that I didn't
take that seriously,

but you have to understand
how it looked.

I thought I did.

I'm sorry.

It's just not something
that I was expecting

to happen on this trip.

And I've been so distracted
with everything.

And I hate that your parents
are helping us right now.

I know that you think
I just obsess over clicks,

but I'm doing this
for us.

And I'm sorry if it doesn't
seem that way right now,

but I promise...

when we get home,
we'll talk about this.

No cameras.

Okay.

So, what do you
want to do now?

I don't know.

Can we just have
a quiet day together?

Yeah.
That would be nice.

At least
the hard drive came.

[ALARM BEEPING]

[BEEPING CONTINUES]

It's not working.

[BEEPING CONTINUES]

The code's not working.
Its 8587, right?

Let me try.

[BEEPING CONTINUES]

[ALARM BLARES]

It is 8587.

[BLARING CONTINUES]

This makes no sense.

[BLARING CONTINUES]

[ALARM STOPS]

Sorry, guys.
The panel isn't working.

I'll head over in just a minute
to fix it for you.

Hope this doesn't
affect the review.

...the place for an entire
month of Christmas.

That saw that I
was living alone.

All their kids had kids,

and did their own thing
for the holidays.

So, they invited me in.
Claire.

We spent
the holidays together.

Christmas, New Year's.
I was here with them.

Betty and Lou.

It was like I was
their family.

I think we should go.

And she for sure said
she made it up?

She said she didn't want
to use her real name.

What does that mean?
Why would she lie about that?

That doesn't make
any sense.

Do You really want to
stick around to find out?

Teddy, we're so close.

I can feel it.
This video is gonna be great.

[UNIDENTIFIED SLAMMING]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]




Screw this.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

That was kind of tense.

Yeah.
Let's get out of here.

I wonder if we can get a refund
for our last day.

Oh, no.

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND MUSIC]


Hey.
Hey.

Are you guys leaving?
Yeah. Yeah.

We got everything
we needed here.

You know,
got a long drive back,

so thought we'd head out
a bit early.

Oh, great.

Well, I hope you
enjoyed your stay.

We did. It was great.
Thank you.

I look forward
to your review.

Yeah, for sure.

Well...
Oh, I almost forgot.

There was one more thing
I wanted to show you.

Can you get your camera?
It'll be quick.

I promise.

Like, here?
Yeah. It's just down there.

Don't worry.
It'll be great.

I mean, consider it.
I know you have to leave.

It's gonna be so good
for our video.

Let's do it.
What?

We need to get
more footage of her.

We already have great stuff.
And we can get more.

Look at her.

She's harmless.

Teddy, this video
is gonna be huge.

I don't feel good
about this.

I know.
But if we can get this right,

we could afford
our own place again.

Is he camera ready?

Yeah. We're rolling.

How do I look.
Is the lighting good?

Sound check?

How's that sound?
Sorry.

I don't really know
what that does.

I've just seen you guys
do it.

Yeah, yeah, it sounds good.
Okay. Great.

Okay. Ready.


Hey, guys,
and welcome to "Superhost."

Is it okay if I say that?

Sure.
Okay. Great.

Hey, guys,
And welcome to "Superhost."

Rebecca...

what are we doing here?

I'm sorry,

Where are you
taking us?

I see your hand is looking
a little light, there, Claire.

What?
Didn't old Teddy Bear propose?

That's what he was supposed
to be doing today.

Guess he had
a change of heart.

No matter.

Eyes over here.

Camera.

Hey, guys, and welcome
to "Superhost."

We have one final surprise
for you

that I think
you're gonna love.

This is gonna be the best
episode of "Superhost" yet.

Come on.

This way.

Where'd she go?



I couldn't help myself.
I'm sorry.

Come on.
It's this way.

Oh, I totally forgot.

Here. This isn't live,
so you can edit this in after.

Just wanted to make sure
we have it.

Don't forget to smash
that "like" button,

and hit that little bell icon,
so you never miss an episode.

Come on.

Holy shit.
Ta-da.

Look what I found.

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

Cut her loose.

I will.
Don't worry.

Why aren't you
filming this?

You're sick.

No, you're sick...

taking advantage of this woman
like that.

Film this.

Film this,
or I cut her throat.

[MUFFLED SCREAMING,
CRYING]

Thank you.

So, Vera, here,
the old Bitch from Draper,

tells me that she lost her
income because of your two.

Is that true?

Is it?!
I don't... I don't know.

That's not what we tried
to do with it.

Is this true?

[MUFFLED CRYING]

[OMINOUS BACKGROUND NOISE]

Here's the thing...

I hated that everything
kept going wrong for you guys.

And I was trying my hardest
to get you the best video ever.

But then, after watching
a little more of you two,

I realize
you're not the perfect duo

you pretend to be
in your stupid videos.

So, when Vera, here, took her
a little revenge trip...

which has horribly
backfired...

I knew...

we need to capitalize
on this.

Camera.

I'm sorry.

This is really
going to hurt.

[MUFFLED SCREAMING]


â™ªâ™ª

I know.

I know.
That hurts a lot.

I'm sorry.

How was that?

What's wrong?
Did you get it?

Claire,
why aren't you filming?

Isn't this what you do?

This should be great
for your show.

What's the problem?

Ready?

Ow.

One, two, three, up.

Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

It was all a joke?

It's just a prank, bro.

What the hell
is wrong with you?

Thank you, Vera.


Give it to me.

Give it.

Give it to me.

No one's ever gonna see
this footage.

I want you to delete
everything you shot here.

I don't actually know
how this thing works.

Here. Sell it.

Make up for some of
your lost income.

Vera... we're sorry.

Fuck you.

What happened
to Betty and Lou?

Who?

What did you do to them?

God damn it.

What is he
talking about?

I really thought
that would work.

What's going on?

Boy, you weren't kidding
about these two.

Can't leave
well enough alone.

I'm sorry about this.

About what?

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

You guys,
you were so close.

Why couldn't you
just stop?

What am I gonna do
with her?

Now what am I
gonna do?

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Hello, there.

Still works.

â™ªâ™ª

Go! Go! Go!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª


[SPEAKING DISTANTLY
AND INAUDIBLY]

Claire.

We have to go.

Okay.
Come on.

[REBECCA WHISTLING]

Claire.

Claire?

I'm sorry.

We should get inside.

I think the car is that way.


Yeah, but she might be waiting
for us.

Okay, okay, okay.

[KEYPAD BEEPING]



â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Do you think
she'll come back here?

â™ªâ™ª

Yeah.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Give me your phone.

Where are you going?

â™ªâ™ª

Don't let anyone open this
but me.

Teddy...
Don't worry.

Your dad told me he'd kill me
if anything happened to you.

â™ªâ™ª

Stop!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Just let us go, please.

We aren't gonna tell anyone.

Do you think I'm stupid?

Of course you will.

Think of all the hits you get.

I can see the thumbnail now...

"The Crazy Bitch Who Killed
the Crazy Bitch From Draper."

No. We'll delete everything.
I promise.

P-Please.

I'm sorry.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Where'd she go?


We have to get out of here.

What are you...

What are you doing?

I want to see if there's
another way out of here.

Keep an eye on the windows.

Go.
I'll be right back.

Hey, Teddy.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

What are you doing?

Silent treatment, eh?

Alright, that's fine.
I get it.

Say, Ted, you want to know
what happened to Betty and Lou?

I really did love those two,

but they... they wouldn't
let me stay.

I told them
I would do anything,

that I couldn't leave
this place, it was my home.

But they just wouldn't listen.

They left me no choice.

Betty and Lou
and their little cat too.

Look, I'm gonna be honest.

You two aren't making it
out of here alive.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Okay. Okay.

â™ªâ™ª

[EXHALES SHARPLY]

If anyone is out there watching,
please, please help us.

I was almost out the door
when Lou just got angry at me.

He got hysterical.

I don't know
what happened after that.

It's all kind of a blur,
but [CHUCKLES]

I'll tell you what, Teddy,

I just kind of... snapped.

This woman, Rebecca, said that
she was the host of this place,

but she's not.

She's a... She's a...

She's a murderer.

Then do you know
what happened?

I had to clean up.

And the funniest part
of it all? [GIGGLES]

Their stupid cat put up
more of a fight than they did.


I don't know how much time
we have left,

so please just call...
call the police, call someone.

We... We need help.


â™ªâ™ª

Come on, please, please, please.

And when it was over,

just when
I was almost cleaned up

and everything was right again,

just when I thought I could
get out of here scot-free...

...you guys came.


Hi, Claire.


â™ªâ™ª


Claire!

â™ªâ™ª

It's not what it looks like.

Rebecca, please.
