How are you?


Oh, my gosh, he said that?

Oh, my god, that is so cute!

Oh, my god, that is so cute!

-Oh, my god, that is so cute! -[knocking]

Morning!

-Hi, aunt angela. -Hey.

Here, let me get it. I got it.

Thank you.

How do I look?

I know it's only been nine months,

But I don't know,

I feel like I lost a step or two.

You look great.


I smell carbs.

Why does he always do this?

Because he's trying.

Because that's what we do, right?

We rise above and we make it work.


Coming!

I mean, it was just so much simpler before.

I know. It was.

But I'm proud of you.

I'm proud of us.

I mean, look at us. We're complete.

We're like one big, happy family now.

Minus the carbs.


Oh, I like that one.

See you down there.

Hmm.

No, that's so cute.

[robert whistling]

-You want a coffee? -Yes, please.

[baby cade babbling]

Hey, gorgeous.

-I love you in these. -Quit it.


Um...

Good morning! Pancakes?

So, big day today?

We're still about two weeks out.

You nervous?

Emma doesn't get nervous.

Not like her auntie. -Oh.

She's got this.

We actually finish learning the dance routine today.

It's short, like, four eight counts.

Then we have to make a speech,

We present to everybody,

Then everyone votes,

And the winner

Is dance team captain junior year.

Wow. Any competition?

Steph, but...

I mean, not really, you know?

I don't know.

<i> Digame.</i>

I'm kinda awesome.

En espaÃ±ol?

I take french.

<i> Je suis gÃ©niale.</i>

Besides, it's not like you're really cuban.

<i> Soy asombroso!</i>

I mean, sure, I'm just a huge cuba-file,

But I don't know,

There could be some cuban blood in me somewhere.

I'm going to get you fluent by the end of the year.

Steph's mom runs pediatrics.

Rachel and I have been friends for years.

Oh, well, may the best dancer win.

Try them.

They're gluten-free.

Zero-calorie.

High-protein.

So good.

[mouths words]

-Mm. -Yes!

Oh, you are so funny, mijito!

You are so funny!

But you can't outsmart your papa!

No, you cannot.

Two things he loves these days--

Yummy oats and throwing his spoons.

Yum. Oh.

There you go.

Hey, you sure you're okay with this?

Okay with it?

Are you kidding me?

I'm lucky.

I mean, remote classes are shorter,

I get to work on my book,

Fix up the beast.

Oh, I hate the beast.

No, you love the beast--

And I get to perfect my cooking--

And, best of all,

I get to take care of our son.

And you get to put up a fence around the pool

Before the baby starts walking.

And I get to put up a fence around the pool

Before the baby starts walking.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Hey, before I forget,

Have either of you seen my camping knife?

You know, the black one with the carved handle?

I'll keep an eye out.

<i> Gracias, princesa.</i>

Come here.

Enjoy, enjoy! Eat your pancakes.

Of course.




There's some new ones in the dishwasher.

[cade cries]

What's this?

Oh, rob wanted to talk to you about that.

He used to lecture there.

He said it's amazing.

95% of their graduates go ivy.

You know, since I know you're looking at yale--

Is it a boarding school?

No, no. Not like that.

It's only a couple hours away,

So you could come home on the weekends.

[horn honks]

Just a second!

This was rob's idea?

He just wants what's best for you.

Anyways, it's just something to think about.

Good luck today.

Have fun.

Thanks, kiddo. I needed that.

Hey.

Steph, you look so cute.

Really?

I keep telling you. It's adorbs.

Right, em?

Yeah. It really suits you.

You don't think it's too short?

No! Are you kidding me?

-You look amazing. -It looks great.


Yeah.

[school bell rings]

[â™ªâ™ª]

All right. Second law.

Stephanie?

Um...

The rate of change of momentum of a body over time

Is directly proportional to...

Ugh!

Who can help her out?

Emma! Give us the business!

The rate of change of momentum of a body over time

Is directly proportional to the force applied,

And occurs in the same direction.


And now, for all the marbles.

What is newton's--

-Sorry. -[teacher] come on in.

Don't be shy.

Physics is the place to be!

Okay, everyone, this is katherine--

Kat.

Just kat.


She's a transfer from upstate.

I'm sure you'll all make her feel welcome.

There's a spot just over there.

All right. Back to the big kahuna.

Newton's third law of motion?

Anyone?

Dazzle me, grossman.

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

[pa announcement]<i> dr. Hammond</i> <i> to emergency room 2.</i>

Hello!

They moved you next to me.

I know. Lucky me.

Well, consider this a housewarming then.

Still your favorite, right?

You remembered.

Hide them under the desk

So the residents don't steal them.

Oh, my gosh!

Isn't he just everything?

-Look at that hair! -I know.

-How're you holding up? -Fine.

I somehow have 12,000 unread emails.

-How is that even possible? -I know.

Hey, listen, you got a second?

I just-- I want to run something by you.

Yeah. Of course.

Dance team captain auditions.

-Oh... -You too, right?

Emma has been counting down the days.

It is...

-Ridiculous. -Yeah.

Girls are already so insecure and so competitive at this age.

You know how long steph cried

After she got her hair cut this weekend?

So I was thinking...

Slumber party.

Pizza, goofy games.

You know, good, clean fun to just lighten it up,

Take the pressure off.

Emma would love that.

[pa announcement]<i> dr. Grossman</i> <i> to emergency room 3.</i>

<i> Dr. Grossman</i> <i> to emergency room 3.</i>

Ah, they know you're here.

Better get in there, doc.

It's just like riding a bike.

Okay...


Emma, jump in.

And...

Five, six, seven, eight!

[â™ªâ™ª]

Stop. You're too stiff.

Floppy feet give me migraines.

And face! Give me face!

â™ª be ferocious â™ª

That was a hot mess. Okay, one more time.

Steph, jump in for emma.

Emma, we need more practice from you.

And... Five, six, seven, eight!

â™ª who you callin' pussycat? â™ª

â™ª pussycat... â™ª

Amy, watch your spacing.

â™ª you know we ain't down with that â™ª

â™ª down with that down with that â™ª

-And face! -â™ª be ferocious â™ª

Better.

Okay, girls,

Catch your breath.

Great job, stephanie.

-Bye, guys. -See ya.

Emma, you coming?

I need a few minutes.

Don't worry, you'll get it.

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]


What's up?

Hey, nathan.

Need a ride?

I'm right around the corner.

Oh. Okay. Okay, cool.

Um...

Next time then?

Sure.

'kay.

Later.

Bye.


I want to make sure you all have your cameras on--

And no cat emoticons this time,

Because last time, we...

The mouth was moving, yeah.

So, make sure your cameras are on.

Trevor, your camera is on.

I don't like to not see your face, okay?

So here we go.

This is the question that I pose to all of you.

Which author,

Of all the novels that we've studied,

Best represents the heart and soul of cuba?

Arenas?

Infante?

Carpentier?

Some of you are even going to make an argument

For padura

That I would be happy to read.

I just think that if you go back

And review chapter five carpentier,

You're going to find...

[robert continues, indistinct]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[angela screams] cade!

Robert!

Oh, my god.

-Cade! -What is the matter with you?

You were supposed to be watching him!

I was watching him!

I don't know what happened! The door was closed!


Do you realize what could have just happened?

Okay, let's just calm down. Are you okay, buddy?

No, no, no! I'm not going to calm down!

This is why I wanted a fence around the pool!

This is exactly what I was afraid of!



After falling into the family pool,

And it is always, always

Too late to save them!

Do you understand?

Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, buddy. I'm so sorry.

All right?

Let's just--

I'm going to get a fence put up around this pool,

And let's all just breathe.

-Just don't. -Angela.

[â™ªâ™ª]

This looks delicious.

Thank you.

Hopefully, we can just have a nice dinner

And forget about the mistake that I made earlier.

Mm! That's nice.

Mm. Mm-mm.

Oh! What is this?


I don't know what happened.

This is really salty.

Emma, don't eat that.

Can I order chinese?

Sure.

[â™ªâ™ª]


[â™ªâ™ª]

He so likes you.

I'm so not interested.

But I so gave him your phone number!

I feel bad.

Should we, like, invite her to sit with us or whatever?

You're too nice, steph.

I'll do it.

Hi! I'm emma.

I know.

Those are my friends.

Steph and lola.

We dance.

I'm sorry.

If you want, you can, like, sit with us.


Seriously?

You don't recognize me, do you?

Should I?

Bye, emma.

Well, the offer still stands if you get bored or whatever.

Only stupid people get bored.

Well?

She said "maybe later."

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

Hey, emma.

Can you come in here for a minute?

Mm-hmm. Yeah. What's up?

Robert and I have some amazing news.


Did you want to tell her or do you want me to tell her?

No, you tell her, you tell her.

Robert called in a few favors,

Got you accepted to st. Crispin's

For your junior and senior year!

I'm doing so well here, though.

Well, then you'll probably do really good there.

Yeah.

Isn't that great?

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

This is incredible.

Thank you, robert.

You're welcome.

Oh, and, hey, I found my knife.

Well, good news all around.

Yay.


How about tomorrow I make some steak?

Oh, yes, please! That would be awesome.

Sounds great.

Can't wait.

[â™ªâ™ª]

â™ª blue skies smilin' at me â™ª

â™ª nothin' but blue skies do I see â™ª

[â™ªâ™ª]

â™ª blue birds singin' a song â™ª

â™ª nothin' but blue birds all day long... â™ª

Mm-hmm.

No, that's the earliest I can be there.

I have two appointments at ten.

I know. Yeah. Okay.

Just let me know exactly where...

[cade babbling]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]




<i> Emma!</i>


<i>Your skin crackles and shrivels</i>

<i> Like homemade bacon</i> <i> in the morning.</i>


<i> I'd never hurt anyone</i> <i> for no reason.</i>

<i> [screaming]</i>

<i> ...A basket of kisses.</i>

<i> A basket of kisses...</i>

<i> A basket of kisses.</i>

<i> [gunshot]</i>


[â™ªâ™ª]

Em?

Emma, what's wrong?

Nothing. Just tired.

S'up?

Can I join you guys?

-Yeah. -Yeah, absolutely.

So, how do you like it here so far?

I don't like it anywhere.

You can't smoke in here.

No?

So where'd you transfer from?

St. Alden's.

Oh, my god!

So you two, like, know each other?

Ish.

I went by katie back then.

You should've said something.

You think you're smart.

You would've figured it out eventually.

Or not.

So wait.

You knew that kid who drowned?

-And that teacher? -Yeah.

Whoa.

Sorry about your dad.

It's fine.

[school bell rings]

-I think-- -you should ask her.

-Ask her, yeah. -Okay.

I'm having a slumber party at my place tomorrow.

It's more of a dance team thing,

But you should totally come.

Maybe.

See ya around, emma.

Oh, that sounds good.

And...

This is for you.

Thank you.


<i> [cade crying on baby monitor]</i>

Oh, you know what...

That sounds like a poopy cry.



-Are you sure? -...Do this.

-Can you watch this? -I will watch this.

-I'll be right back. -I'll do my best.

[cell phone ringing]

Is that your phone?

[cell phone ringing]

Oh, uh, darn it. It's in the office.

Okay.

Okay... You watch these, I'll be two minutes.

Okay.

[â™ªâ™ª]



Hey, yes. We're definitely still on for ten.

Okay.

[cade babbling]

Okay, all clean. All clean.

All clean. Good boy.

[smoke alarm beeping]

Robert?


Robert!

The fire extinguisher-- it's under the sink!

[smoke alarm beeping loudly]

Emma, no, don't.

I thought you were supposed to be watching it.

I was watching it.

I don't know what happened. I left it with emma.

I had to go to the bathroom.

I was gone for two seconds.

It's not my fault!

Well, then whose fault is it?

Okay, quiet, please, both of you.

[alarm beeping loudly]

Should we do takeout again?

Takeout's fine.


<i> It costs the same</i> <i> whether you talk or not.</i>

I'm aware.

<i> What is running through</i> <i> that brain of yours?</i>

What if the laws of physics applied to people as well?

Action.

Equal and opposite reaction?

<i> I don't think</i>

<i> That's what newton meant.</i>

My aunt wants to send me to a boarding school.

<i> I'm aware.</i>

<i> And just for the record,</i>

<i> I've heard that school</i> <i> is outstanding.</i>

<i> Its alumni end up at--</i>

Ivy leagues all across the country.

I'm aware.

I've read the brochure. Twice.

<i> Most girls in your shoes</i> <i> would be thrilled.</i>

Robert wants me out of the house.

<i> And why would he want that?</i>

<i> Did you behave in such a way</i>

<i> That might have precipitated</i> <i> his decision?</i>

<i> Did your action</i> <i> cause a reaction?</i>

Maybe.

<i> So you created a problem.</i>

<i>And what is the proper response</i> <i>to a problem of our own making?</i>

Solving it.

<i> And you are good</i> <i> at solving problems,</i>

Aren't you?

Yes.

I'm very good at solving problems.

Thank you, dr. March.

This has been incredibly helpful.

<i> I am so glad to have been able</i> <i> to help you, emma.</i>

All right. Bye.

[â™ªâ™ª]

Robert...

I wanted to apologize...

Uncle robert...

I just wanted to apologize...

Hi.

Hey.

I thought you might be thirsty.

Can we talk?

Uncle robert...

I just wanted to apologize

For forgetting to give you back your knife.

I found it next to all the pool equipment

And it just slipped my mind to give it back to you, so...

I'm sorry.

Thank you.

You know,

Change is hard for everyone.


For me...

After my dad, you know,

It's just...

I guess, sometimes, something gets in my head...

And...

Maybe I'll do something I shouldn't have.

I understand.

Maybe this is good for us, huh?

Maybe we could start over.

Yeah.

And who knows,

Maybe st. Crispin's will be good for me.

Really?

Yeah. 90% of their grads go ivy.

I want to go ivy,

So I'd say those are pretty good odds.

Yeah.

Besides, you're doing what's best for your family

And for me, so.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Hey...

Come here.


No, steph's is right around the corner.

I'm going to walk.

Okay. Well, have fun!

And just let me know if you need anything.

Anything at all.

-I will. -And...

Robert told me you two are good.

You have no idea how happy that makes me, honey bear.

[â™ªâ™ª]

[loud rock music playing]

[loud rock music playing]


Emma?

Angela?

Huh.


[object clattering]



[emma whistling "clair de lune"]

[girls laughing]

[girls screaming excitedly]

Come in!

-Hi! -Hi.

Come on. Go have a seat.

Hey.

Isn't that hilarious?

That's so hilarious.

What did you guys get?


-I think so. -That's what I said.

-[doorbell rings] -who's that?

-It's kat. -Oh, right.

I still don't see why you guys had to invite her.

Because she's your friend.

I was trying to be nice.

It is so nice

To have some of the girls on the team here.

Now, you girls have fun.

And remember,

The only person you're ever really competing with

Is yourself.

Thanks, mom.

That's really helpful.

Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

So how cool is it

That you and emma used to know each other?


We weren't really friends, though.

We weren't?

I mean, let's face it.

You weren't really friends with anyone.

-I'm sure that's not true. -It so is.

Remember that time I tripped

And you stole my watch?

I don't think that was me.


But whatever.

It's cool.

Anyone wanna play a game?


Robert?

Robert?

[â™ªâ™ª]


Do I get to go first since it's my house?

Never have I ever cheated on a test.

[â™ªâ™ª]


Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

Love that we are goin' old school on the gas.

Okay...

Never have I ever...

Made out in the front seat of a car.

B.S.


I didn't say anything about the back.

Oh, my god, saint emma.

You've never done anything.

I'm even on meds and I'm smoking.

Who's next?

I'll go.

Make it good.

Never have I ever...

...Killed anyone.

[â™ªâ™ª]

Who did you...?

Who did you kill?

My mom.

When I born.

Oh, thank god.

I mean. You know what I mean.

What'd you think I meant?

Did you think I actually killed someone?

I'm not a psycho.

What the--

Mom!

Emma, honey, grab your things.

I'm taking you to the hospital.

Why?

There's been an accident.

Come on.

We will talk about this later.

[â™ªâ™ª]

Aunt angela?

Emma.

Come here.

What happened?

He was pinned...

That car.

I've always hated that car,

And the...

The jack malfunctioned somehow,

And he was pinned under it for god knows how long.

But he's strong.

He's always been strong.

And so now we just have to wait and see.

[â™ªâ™ª]

â™ª I'm a ghost â™ª

â™ª I'm a dream â™ª

â™ª I'm the sun â™ª

â™ª I'm the crown â™ª

â™ª I'm the queen â™ª

â™ª kingdom come â™ª

â™ª we all need a master â™ª

â™ª everyone's a jester â™ª

â™ª laughing at the mirror... â™ª

Are we friends now?

[cade giggles]

You're silly.

â™ª ...You can try to run â™ª

â™ª it'll never end â™ª

â™ª 'cause I have just begun â™ª

Hey.

I know you don't want to eat right now.

It's important to keep your strength up.

That's what robert would want you to do.

Cade?

He's fine.

Just put him down for his nap.

Little guy doesn't even know anything's wrong.

Groceries are coming in an hour.

What would I do without you, honey bear?

Is he going to be okay?

I don't know.

We're going to make it through this, all right?

Because we're grossmans.

That's what we do.

We rise above and we make it work.

That's right.


[â™ªâ™ª]

[emma whistling "clair de lune"]

[emma whistling "clair de lune"]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[cell phone ringing]

Hello? This is emma.

<i> Hey, emma.</i> <i> It's nathan.</i>

Hi.

<i> Steph told me about your uncle</i> <i> and I just--</i>

<i> I just wanted to check in,</i> <i> see how you were holding up.</i>

Um...

Yeah, I'm...

I'm fine.

<i> Okay. Cool, cool.</i>

<i> I was--</i> <i> I was just checking.</i>

Okay.

Um, bye.

<i> Bye.</i>

[â™ªâ™ª]

Are you kidding?

[robert moans]

Oh! Robert, robert!

No, no, no. No, you've got to leave that in for now.

It's okay.

Nod if you can hear me.

That's good.

Do you know where you are?

You're in a hospital.

There was an accident and you got hurt.

We just have to get you extubated

And get you home,

And with physio therapy,

You're going to be up and walking in a few months.

It's okay, it's okay.

Please, don't-- don't move.

Robert...

Do you remember what happened?

You want-- you want to write something?

Okay. Yeah.

Here.

Here.

There you go. There you go.

[â™ªâ™ª]

I've been dancing with you girls

For the past couple of years now.

I just...

I don't know, we've had so much fun together.

We've had so much fun together.

We've... We've had--


Can you come downstairs?

Coming!

You're home early.

I have incredible news.

What?

Robert's going to pull through.

I knew he'd make it through.

Yeah.

I don't want to keep him in there

A minute longer than he has to be,

So we're going to set him up down here,

I'm bringing in a nurse,

Physical therapist.

He's going to be up and walking

Before we know it.

Has he said anything?

He's had flashes.

What kind of flashes?

Nothing specific. That's it.

I remember everything that happened to me.

Yeah, but you're special, emma.

I know.

And you're the first person he asked about when he came to.

What did he say?

He asked if you were all right.

He loves you, honeybear.

I need to go and practice.

Election's tomorrow.

Okay.

Have fun.

[â™ªâ™ª]

â™ª gonna turn back time â™ª

â™ª wanna control it â™ª

[â™ªâ™ª]

â™ª can we slow it down? â™ª

â™ª down, down â™ª

â™ª yeah, you say what you wanna say now â™ª

â™ª it's not the time to sit and wait around â™ª

â™ª come close and you can find your way around â™ª

[â™ªâ™ª]

What's going on?

-You haven't heard? -No.

Things have been kinda busy at my place.

Where's steph?

Not coming.

Why?

Somebody totally stole her dog out of her backyard last night,

And this morning, some jogger found it.

And?

It was dead, emma!

Like, chopped up and stabbed,

And blood and guts everywhere!

That is so horror movie.

Do they know who did it?

Some psychopath.

The world is full of them.

That's why there's so many podcasts.

[school bell rings]

Hey.

Hey, nathan.

What's up?

Not much.

Can I walk you to class?

Sure.

Okay.

[indistinct conversation]


We have a bit of a dilemma before us at the moment.

Stephanie lowford.

She's not here to audition, obviously,

And for good reason.

So, the question becomes

Is she still eligible for captain next year?

I say yes.

I mean, it's not her fault

Someone went all stabby-stab on her pup.

She really wants this

And she's been working super hard.

Any opposed?

Emma.

Um...

I just wanted to say that I agree with lola.

I think that we all do.

Girls?

Okay.

Then let's get to it.

Anyone still interested in running for captain,

Come up here

And tell us why you think

You'd be the best to lead the team.

Then afterwards,

We're going to vote by secret ballot,

And, yes, you can still vote for stephanie.

So, who's first?

The floor is yours.

Um...

I've been dancing with you girls for the past couple years now,

And I just feel like we have so much fun together.

I just really want to make sure

That we make good memories together,

Because I want to be able to look back on them

When we're all old and gray, I guess,

And be able to say...

"damn, dance team was really sick."

And I just...

You know...

Like I said,

I just really want

To keep on making great memories with you guys.

I love you all,

And...

I don't know, I guess that's my "speech".

Please vote for me as dance captain.

If you don't, no hard feelings,

I guess,

And, yeah,

Go, wasps!



Hey.

Good news.

Robert gets to come home in one week.

I just have to sort out this room for him.

Because of his wheelchair.

That's great.

And you have an interview with st. Crispin's this weekend.

They just want to touch base with you

And see how you're feeling about enrollment, okay?

Mm-hmm. I can't wait.

Oh!

How did it go?

Steph won.

I am so happy for her.

Emma, do you want to talk about it?

No. No, I don't.

Sorry. Excuse me.

Emma.

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]




[â™ªâ™ª]



Since there is a teen in the household,

The medicine cabinet

Must remain locked at all times.

Okay.

Take one key and keep it on your person,

Always,

And I'll have mine as well.

Okay.

Emma. Hey.

Come in, princesa. Don't be shy.


Emma, this is cora.

She's going to be with us during the day

To help out with robert.

-Hi. -Hi.

If you ever need anything, just let me know.

I'm thinking about going into medicine

Like my aunt.

Excellent.

You should be so proud.

Yeah.

Hmm.

Hi.

It's nice to have you back inside the house.

It's so good to be home.


Very, very bad.


I'm in so much pain right now.

Yeah, the point is to get you weened off,

Not get you hooked.

Right.

Can you tell that to my hips and my legs?

Robert--

I'm fine.

Do you remember what happened?

No.

Nada.

Just...

Black.


Yeah. Let me show you.


Are you thirsty?

Here.

What?

Nothing.

I, um...

I brought you this.

That way, you can always feel close to him.

That's very thoughtful, emma. Thank you.

I'm trying to stick at it, like, as long as I can.

[school bell rings]

Uh, think you could give us a second?

Oh, yeah, sure. Absolutely.

I'll just meet you in class.


What? What do you want?

So that's what now?

Six?

Six what?

Six unfortunate coincidences.

But the last one

Didn't really work out the way you wanted it to, did it?

Steph still beat you.

I know all about you.

Do tell.

Where should I start?

With the housekeeper falling down the stairs?

Milo drowning?

Mrs. Ellis' car wreck?

A babysitter burning to death?

A dad getting shot.

A stepuncle getting crushed by a car.

And now a dog getting chopped up in a park?

[school bell rings]

Coincidences?

Or a pattern?

Stray kat has claws.

You've been busy.

If I've really been that busy,

You might want to be careful.

Or what?

-I'll tell everyone. -Tell them what?

The truth!


Are you coming?

I'll be there in a second.

Accidents happen all the time to people.

Especially people like you.

People like me?

People who hurt themselves.

I may have hurt myself,

But it's really you I feel sorry for.

Well, you shouldn't worry about me, silly.

I feel bad for you.

You'll always be alone.

Maybe.

But at least I won't be you, kitty kat.

Hey!

Are you serious?

You can't just slap people. What the hell's wrong with you?

You okay?

She's insane!

What's going on here!

-She slapped her. -She slapped me!

Nothing.

Kat. That's detention.


-For a week! -Whatever!

What the hell?

Nathan, please take her to the nurse's office.

Of course.

Come on.

Why don't you just relax for the rest of the period?

Let me know if you need anything.

[â™ªâ™ª]

[emma whistling "clair de lune"]

<i> [cartoons playing on tv]</i>



<i> [cartoons playing]</i>

Hey. What is it, honeybear?

Nothing.

Emma, come on.

It's me.

All right, I get it,

It's been a rough couple of weeks,

But...

I mean, how's school?

It's okay.

Okay?

There's this girl.

Her name is kat.

She transferred from st. Alden's.

Oh... Wow.

Did you know her?

Was she in the same grade as you?

Not really.

She's just been saying

Some really awful things to me lately.

About?

About milo.

Mrs. Ellis. My dad.

You know, she thinks I had something to do with it,

Everything that happened to us.

And...

I wasn't going to say anything,

But she hit me today.

What?

Yeah, and I...

And just with everything that's been going on lately,

I mean, it's just awful.

Hey.

I promise you,

I am going to squash this real quick. Okay?

I'm going to make a phone call first thing in the morning.

Come here. It's okay.

This is just a rough patch, kiddo.

We are going to get through this.

I promise.

Hey, it's okay.

So is there...

Any good news?

I mean, there's this boy...

Really?

He's cute.

Wow.

Sorry.

<i> [cartoons playing on tv]</i>

No. I don't want to hear that you'll look into it.

I want it taken care of immediately.

Yes.

And if you don't plan on calling kat's parents,

Then I will.

Okay. All right then.

Thank you.

More good news, I take it?

I wish.

How's steph?

She a bit better,

Now that the shock has worn off.

Harold promised

To buy her a new dog this summer.

They still haven't figured out who did this?

No. No.

A jogger saw someone walking the dog.

We got a little on our security cam,

But nothing determinate.

Who does something like that?

Who would kill an innocent animal?

Harold thinks I'm crazy,

But I could have sworn

That it was young woman in that footage.

I'll send it to you.

Yeah.

But...

Tell emma congratulations on back-up dance team captain.

Steph said she was very sweet about it.

I will let her know.

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

Steph!

Someone get the nurse!

Someone get the nurse!!

Oh, my god!

Call 911!

She needs her meds.

-Stephanie! -Oh, my god!

This is very disappointing.

What is?

Your continued harassment of emma grossman.

We don't condone violence at the school.

Okay, listen, it was not my fault.

I was just--

Stephanie lowford's had a seizure.

Her midazolam is missing.

I've called 911 and they're on their way.

[cell phone ringing]

Emma...

Oh, my god.

Rachel, I--

Something happened at the school!

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[footsteps approaching]


Nothing.

You wouldn't lie to me,

Would you?

No.

I would never.

I'm not mad, emma.

I'm not.

I just need to know the truth.

-About? -Everything.

Did you do something to your friend, stephanie?

She had a seizure.

How could that have been my fault?

Her dog?

That wasn't me.

Emma, I saw you.

I saw you on the ring-door cam.

No, you didn't!

I did, emma. This is your sweater.

No.

Stop lying to me!

Tell me the truth!

Emma, tell me!

Okay, I'm sorry!

All right?

I let her dog out, okay?

I wanted to be dance captain so bad,

And stephanie, she just...

She makes me so angry.

So I just-- I thought--

I wanted to hurt her and I let her dog out.

I thought it was going to come back.

I thought they would find it.

I'm sorry!

I promise! I promise I didn't hurt it!

I swear!

Okay, okay.

Okay. It's okay.

Oh, god.

It's okay.

What would you give me for a basket of hugs, aunt angela?

[â™ªâ™ª]

Hey.

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[robert moaning]


Now, see? This isn't so bad.


It's 57 degrees.

Fresh air builds the immune system.

You know, in russia,

They used to bundle up children

And have them take a nap in the snow in the winter.

True story.

Do you want to know

What cubans think of the russians?

I--


What the hell?

Oh...

What?

Great.

[â™ªâ™ª]

I need a favor.

Of course.

Can you bring him back inside in a little while?

I have a minor disaster to deal with.

Don't worry. I got it.

Okay.



Hey.

Yeah, hi, nathan. It's emma.

What are you doing?

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ª]

No, I'm not doing anything.


Yeah, I'm good.

It's quite chilly out.


I want to get inside and warm up,

Take my meds.

Can you help me in there?

Whatever.

Emma!

Yeah. Mm-hmm.

Yeah, no, it's nothing.

Yeah.

Emma!

Hmm... Yeah.

No, no, no.

That's the stupidest joke I've ever heard.

Yeah.

God.



There.

Get up.

[emma talking, indistinct]



Oh...

Robert?

What in god's name?


What is happening here?

You're ignoring me. I'm trying to--

I was finishing a call, I'm sorry.


See?


She was coming back to get you.

You couldn't have waited a few more minutes?

Just get me inside.

All right.

So...

What's his name?

Nathan.

Oh!

Nathan...

Well, I hope he's not as stubborn as this one.

[emma whistling "clair de lune"]

<i> [screaming]</i>

<i>[emma whistling "clair de lune"]</i>

[emma whistling]

[emma whistling "clair de lune"]

Sorry.

It's leftovers.

Angela's been at the hospital all day.

I already fed cade.

I hope you're not mad about earlier.

You fool so many.

But not me.

Not anymore.

What are you talking about?

I remember everything. I know it was you.

What are you gonna do about it?

This is what I'm going to do.

I love my wife,

And she loves you,

So hurting you hurts her,

And I don't want that.

Not after what happened to her brother.

So, I am going to get better...

...And I'm not going to say anything.

In exchange for what?

You will go to boarding school

And leave the baby and us alone.

What if I don't want to do either of those things?

Well, then I'm going to tell the truth.

And angela will be hurt,

But you will be hurt way more.

No ivy league.

No happy life.

No nothing.

You will be locked away forever.

Completely alone.

Who's that for?

It's for you.

To keep you company.

Keep an eye on you.

Where are you going?

I'm going to visit an old family friend.

Should be back in a couple of hours, okay?

Okay.

What about cade?

I'm taking him with me.

Don't worry.

I'll be back soon.

That's fine. You go.

-Enjoy yourself. -Okay.

How's that hip?

It's still there.

-It'll heal. -Okay.

<i> Mi amor.</i>

-I love you. -I love you, too.

Hmm.

You ready to go for a car ride?

Okay, you're going to sleep the whole way, right?

There we go. Good boy.

Okay, let's go.

[â™ªâ™ª]

Brian. Hi.

Thank you.

How was the drive?

Not bad.

I haven't been out this way since...

Well, you know.

I'm glad you reached out.

I've been, uh...

Wanting to reach out to you, too,

It's just...

I haven't been able

To work up the nerve to call you.

It's...

It's been eating at me...

What happened,

What I had to do.

<i> Stop right there, david!</i>

<i> I will not let you</i> <i> hurt that girl.</i>

<i> [gunshot]</i>

<i> [screaming]</i>

I want to move on, too.

You ask away.

Anything you need to know.

My brother.

When he first arrived, with emma...

...What did he say?

I mean, how did he act?

Did he...

Did he seem crazy?

He seemed steady.

Not crazy.

Just sad, I guess.

But it was clear as day that he adored that little girl.

And how is she, by the way? How's emma?

She's not so little anymore.

It's a shame what happened.

And I am so sorry.

No, no, please, don't.

I know that he was threatening her,

And I know that you were trying to protect her,

So, please, did he say anything to you?

Before it happened?

Before you...

Had to shoot him?

He was obviously unwell.

-But... -But?

One thing that stood out...

...Something he said I'll never be able to forget.

What?

He said...

"there's something wrong with her.

I need to protect her from herself."

And that's it.

What if I told you...

He also said that she would do it again.

Do you know what that might mean?

No.

<i> [cade babbling]</i>

[thunder crashing]

Emma, what are you doing here?

Just checking on you.

Making sure you're still breathing.

-This is cute. -Leave it alone.

Emma, did you hear that thunder?

It seems like a storm is coming in.

Sounds like a doozy.

Is there anything I can help you with

Before you head out?

Uh, no, I don't think so.

I just want to get out before the storm hits.

Yeah. But thank you.

-You're welcome. -Okay, honey.


-Mm-hmm. -Yeah, okay, so...

Take care.

All right. Bye.

Okay.

<i> [line ringing]</i>


Answer the phone.

<i> [line ringing]</i>


Hi, kat.

I didn't think you'd pick up.

<i> Well, I did.</i>

<i> [line ringing]</i>


I just kind of need someone to talk to.

Do you think you could come over?

[cell phone ringing]

Yeah, I just...

I don't know...

[cell phone ringing]

I really am a good person...

Deep down.

<i> Okay...</i>

I just can't go on like this.

[cell phone ringing]

If you come over,

I promise I'll tell you everything.

[cell phone ringing]

<i> -Everything?</i> -Everything.

Please?

I just...

I'm so tired of being alone.

And plus...

I really need to talk about nathan.

I really like him, and...

I don't know what to do about it.

Maybe you could just...

Give me advice or something.

All right?

<i> Okay, emma.</i>

<i> But only</i> <i> if you tell me everything.</i>


Yeah, I actually invited kat over

To try and clear the air a little bit.

<i> I think that's great, yeah.</i>

Yeah.

She shouldn't stay too long, though,

So maybe you can come over in, like, an hour or so?

<i> Really? That would be cool.</i> <i> Okay. Yeah.</i>

Yeah.

She'll probably be here any minute, though,

So I got to let you go.

<i> -Oh, okay.</i> -All right.

<i> -Bye.</i> -Bye.

[â™ªâ™ª]

[thunder rumbling]

[doorbell ringing]

Hey. Come in, silly.

I made us hot chocolate.

Just like my dad used to make.

[text alert chiming]

How is it?

Good, I guess.

What's up with nathan?

Is that what you want to talk about, emma?

I just...

I never really know how to act around him.

Well, if you like him, just be yourself.

It's really nice to have someone to talk to.

I never really have anyone to talk to.

Not really.

Maybe there's a reason for that.

It's hard...

To be different,

You know?

Things have been kind of crazy lately.

How so?

My uncle--

My step-uncle--

He wanted to send me away to a boarding school.

He thought I was going to do something to the baby.

Did you?

<i> [â™ªâ™ª]</i>

The baby's fine.

Your uncle isn't.

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

Newton's third law.

That's basic physics.

<i> [screaming]</i>

<i>[emma whistling "clair de lune"]</i>

Accidents happen.

Come on!

Hurry up.

Hurry up!


An accident?

Exactly.

<i> [â™ªâ™ª]</i>


That was so tragic.

And milo and mrs. Ellis?

And your dad, emma?

Your own dad?

He started it.

How?

Hot chocolate.

How was it by the way?

Don't spill on my rug.

-[kat moaning] -there it is.

It was taking so long, I thought it might not work.

What did you give me?

Everything.

Literally.

You won't get away with--

Get away with this?

You're so melodramatic.

Hey...

You wanna see something cool?


<i> [line ringing]</i>

<i> 911. What's your emergency?</i>

Oh, my god, please help me!

My name is emma grossman!

There's this girl-- she's insane!

I invited her over to come and have hot chocolate

And she started a fire!

She's attacking me!

Please help me!


That was the sound of me getting away with it.

Works every time.

I'm a psycho.

That's fun to say.

Too bad no one will ever hear that.

Mrs. Leyva.

Milo.

Mrs. Ellis.

Chloe.

My dad.

Stephanie and that ridiculous dog.

You.

Uncle robert.

You guys all just cause too much trouble.

Don't mess with psychos.

Really....

What did I just say?

I mean, what are you trying to do with this?


God.

Now what are you going to do? Cry?

Please.

You don't have to do this.

Just go to sleep already.

All right?

I hate to say it,

But this is getting a little boring.

Thank you for the advice about nathan.

Just be myself.

I'll try.

This wouldn't have been possible without you.

You really are the best friend I've ever had.

Emma...

<i> [cade crying]</i>

What are you doing?

Equal and opposite reactions.

To be honest,

It was probably always going to end up this way.

I am sorry, robert.

Sort of.

[vehicle approaching]

Angela.

Emma!

Aunt angela!


What?

He was right about you!


Your dad,

My brother--

He loved you more than anything,

But he was right!

You're a monster!

You don't mean that!

Kat just tried to kill us!

Liar!

What did you do to her?

To robert?

What did you do, emma?


No...

Don't go.



Robert!

[cade babbling]

Hi, friend.



[â™ªâ™ª]

Robert, wake up.

Robert, wake up, please!

Come on.

Come on, get up!

Come on, we've got to get you out of here!

Come on, robert.

Please!

[â™ªâ™ª]

[robert groaning]

[â™ªâ™ª]

[sirens wailing]

[â™ªâ™ª]

Help! Please!

Please! My aunt! She's still in there!

This girl--she tried to burn our house down.

Please! You've got to try and save her!

You wait here!

[â™ªâ™ª]

Emma! Are you okay?

-Oh, my god. -Jesus christ.


How the hell did this happen?


It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

[â™ªâ™ª]


We have an amazing woman who can take you in

Until everything gets sorted.

I'm so sorry, emma.

I can't imagine how difficult this is for you.

I loved my aunt.

And my uncle.

[cade babbles]

Can cade and I at least stay together?

We'll do our best.

He's the only family I have left.

I need to make a few calls.

Is there anything you need?

Emma, you know this isn't your fault.

[â™ªâ™ª]

We'll be fine.

We're grossmans.

We rise above.

[â™ªâ™ª]

Okay.
