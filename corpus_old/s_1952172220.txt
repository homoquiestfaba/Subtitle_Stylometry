Why are you crying if you like it?

You like it a lot, they all love it

Stay still, I don't want to have to hurt you

That's it, stay still now

That's how I like em, all tied up

What happened?

Do you want me to leave?

No, stay there and keep quiet

Where were you Maco?

Training?

What were you practicing Maco,

karate?

What good is that shit?

You want to win a championship?

Do you think you're Van Damme?

No,

we'll get a client that knows kung fu

and our bouncer Maco Gutierrez

will show off all his skills

and it'll be the match of the century

No joke, I just give the
word and everyone goes packing

If that's what I needed I'd
just get a gorilla, nothing else

So...

when you're at the gym

check the clock

If you're short three flying kicks

leave them for another
day, you need to be here

Now go, and don't forget

Open it

The way we're going I
doubt there will be a change

Your brother hasn't left
his room for over three years,

the only people he allows to enter
are the nurse Juanita, you and myself

I've thought about this a lot
Maco, I think our only option

is that you let me give him the
treatment I discussed with you

In the police files, a
new case of a missing girl

That's three minors this month

and the possibility that it's connected

to a ring of pedophiles
has their parents terrified

Let's hear from the father of the child

Well, it's been three days
since she disappeared

A neighbor saw her get in a car and

no one heard from her since

She's my only daughter,
please, if anyone knows anything

And on that same note,

an incident worthy of a comic
book or a Hollywood picture,

a brutal armed robbery was foiled

by a strange masked man

Here's one of the victims to tell us more,

our reporter Carol Valdivieso

This is no Iron Man, he doesn't
climb walls like a spider,

not rich enough to have a
Batmobile and he can't fly either

He's a man of flesh and
blood, just like you and I,

a man with courage and a strong will,
that on seeing people in danger

risked his life to save us

Yesterday evening in this very place
while I ate dinner with some friends

three men wearing ski
masks broke into the house,

beating us and tying us up

with the intention of stealing valuables,

but this remained only an intent as
there arrived a shadow, a silhouette

He appeared and disappeared like a mirage

and with his bare hands
he defeated three robbers

whose fire arms were of no use

Once they were incapacitated, he
escaped without leaving a trace

Hero, where are you? How
can I thank you personally?

People like you give hope to our society

and it fills us with pride to know
that a man with real guts still exists

From the scene of the crime this is Carol V

Yes?

Maco,

look

This started last night

He saw the television
in the hall from his room

and when they were giving the news of
that superhero who saved the journalist

he started yelling like a madman that
he wanted a television in his room

Well obviously we tried to
take advantage of the situation

to get him to come out,

but it didn't work, we couldn't convince him

So what we did is make him that hood,

and today

he's like this

Incredible

<i>If you have a problem don't hestitate
to write to me and I'll fix it</i>

Who the hell is this guy?

We've finally run into Spiderman

You'll see, I'm gonna
make you shit your pants

Alright, stay there, stay
there, this one's mine

Give him to me

Let's see what ya got

Let's fight like men

Come on, get up bastard

Excessive use of steroids?
A protein overdose?

A masked man carries out justice
again on the streets of Santiago

and it seems to be the same one that
saved our reporter Carol Valdivieso

In the early hours in downtown Santiago

the flesh and blood
superhero has struck again

According to witness testimony
it could be the same man

who only three days ago
defeated three armed men

Let's go over the footage

The witness say the man was over
180 cm, had defined musculature

and was wearing a ridiculous
and somewhat effeminate outfit

The vigilante knocked out four
men at once without a problem

At the scene we found this note which
holds a message from the supposed superhero

The text is as follows: If you have a problem

don't hestitate to write to me and
I'll fix it elvigilante@zami.com

So now you know, if you need a
superhero don't think twice and

contact him at elvigilante@zami.com

That's all, we'll keep you informed on
this matter when more news is available

From downtown Santiago, this is Carol V

Mr. Vigilante, if you're going
to continue with your work

the least you could do is wear an outfit
that won't make the criminals laugh

Here Maco

He exists, I saw him on TV

<i>Vigilante, I'm a big fan of yours, you're
like my idol. I'm interested in helping you,</i>

<i>I have equipment that can help you in the
fight against crime. Accept me as your Robin</i>

<i>I await your response. Goodbye
with a hug, Pseudo Robin</i>

<i>Mr. Vigilante, my 10 year old son is
beaten every day by a gang of killers</i>

<i>Please end this abuse! Come and give that
gang a lesson! Tomorrow at 2 pm the gang will</i>

<i>be at the corner of Torres Bilboa and
Antonio Varras. I'm begging you, Mrs. Flora</i>

<i>Mrs. Flora, I'll be there
tomorrow. Your servant,</i>

Mission 01

Mirageman vs
The Bilboa Gang

That e-mail we sent? That was a lie,

we just wanted to see if you'd
be dumb enough to come here

We've been waiting for you. You
think you're hard? We're harder

Come on kid, go get him

<i>The Vigilante Destroys a Violent Gang</i>

<i>Big Headed Karate Expert
Thinks He's a Superhero</i>

<i>The Vigilante Signs His E-mails as Mirageman</i>

What, does he think he's
Robin Hood or something?

No, see, people

have to be helped by the police,
there's no need for a superhero

A personality of this type doesn't
help, it doesn't contribute at all

He shouldn't do it,
that's what the law is for

The guy must be way into
comics, Batman, Superman

I think he's going to
end up on a reality show

He's a clown, probably escaped
from some mental institution

In my secret identity I'm all for him

The police doesn't do anything so it's
good that Mirageman does what he does

I think he's crazy. Honestly, someone
like that shouldn't be loose on the streets

Everyone should be allowed
to do what they want, I think

Hello, I wanted to send a
message directly to Mirageman

Mirageman, I know you're seeing
me. I'm a loyal follower of yours

and

I want to be a sort of
your assistant, a partner

I know how to defend myself
well, I'm a black belt

and you haven't responded to my e-mails so

I decided to join up with you and

besides I have two motorcyles
that are ready to be used

Thank you sir, thank you

<i>Mirageman, first of all congratulations,
your courage is inspiring</i>

<i>I'd like you to come to an exclusive
interview, it'll be very private,</i>

<i>just you, me and the cameramen, no one
else. You pick the place and we'll make a set</i>

<i>The whole country wants
to see you. A kiss, Carol V</i>

<i>To Converse is Beautiful
with Carol Valdivieso</i>

He doesn't shoot spiderwebs, he doesn't fly,

he doesn't wear a cape and
doesn't even have a Batmobile

He takes the bus

Today's guest is the man of the moment

Some know him as The Vigilante,

he calls himself Mirageman

Good evening
Good evening

Thank you for agreeing to an interview

People would like to know what
the man behind the mask is like

What is your motivation?

I can't tell you my biggest motivation but

since that day I rescued
you from that assault

and I saw you on TV thanking me
I realized what my life's work is

You opened my eyes

Do you feel people take seriously?

To be honest I don't care what people think

People

and the press say you're a clown,

that you dedicate yourself to things
that don't matter and that you don't help

with the criminal problem in Chile

What do you think of that?

Does that hurt or do you not care?

<i>Carol Valdivieso
Famous at Mirageman's Expense</i>

<i>I'm not interested in being a sex symbol</i>

<i>Channel 10 is leading in the
ratings thanks to Mirageman</i>

<i>Carol Valdivieso earns as
much as a Hollywood star</i>

<i>She says "I'd do anything for ratings"</i>

Mirageman, I have a mission you can't refuse

Investigations have confirmed that
the children that have disappeared

over the last two months have been
victims of a ring of pedophiles

I know where the leader of the gang is hiding

and it's likely that the
missing girl is there too,

but the investigations department doesn't
have enough proof to raid the place

Mirageman, you're the only hope
of ending this macabre abuse

I admire your initiative
and everything you've done,

and I know you can stop
crimes of this caliber

If you're interested
and want more information

I'll leave key information
in the Teatino alley

Inside a garbage can
there will be a blue bag,

you have 48 hours to pick it up

Good luck, Juan Moli

Mission 28

Mirageman vs
The Pedophile Ring

Hey, look here

Imbecile

Get up dumbass

To the river

Disappear Mirageman

<i>Has Mirageman Left the Streets?</i>

<i>Where is the Chilean Batman?</i>

<i>Confirmed: Missing Girl Held
Captive by Pedophile Ring</i>

Two weeks have gone by

and Mirageman the vigilante has not appeared

We suppose that the numerous accusations

from the people and press
over his mediocre efforts

made him finally leave the-

It's a shame what happened

We saw so much progress in your brother,

one day he nearly left his room,

the nurses were praying he would

but he changed his mind

Curiously, when that superhero
stopped appearing in the news

his condition worsened

And now he's like this,

he doesn't want to come out
and he doesn't let anyone in

You know I paid for all
of those, all 30 of them!

Don't touch me you filthy faggot

You have no idea who I am,

so just step aside and let me through

Do you know karate precious?

Karate my love?

Come hit me, come give me a little tap

Let's get things all set

Hit me, here

Stop acting like a goddamn
ballerina and hit me!

Hit you dumbass, here, hit me

What do they pay you for?

What do they pay you for faggot?
Hit me already you fucker!

You need cash for the gym?
Here, have some change

Buy yourself some protein shakes to
get some more muscles on your brain

Here, just slug me one already

You wanna hit me? Am I pissing you off?

There you go you fucking faggot

The superhero who left us keeps
giving us things to talk about

but not because of his deeds,
rather because of his fans

I can't say my name but
I'm known as Pseudo Robin

Because of Mirageman's absense a citizen
who prefers to be called Pseudo Robin

has decided to replace him

This morning, this new masked
man was caught on camera

When two thugs tried to steal a car stereo

Pseudo Robin made his official debut

When I was going home

and I found two guys that were stealing

the radio cover, that's this

I managed to get it from them

I didn't win the fight, but I recovered
the cover, that's what's important

As you can see

I had a little beating
there, my arm is all dirty

It isn't much but I survived

Since I was small I wanted to be a superhero

and I was motivated by that
hero that was on TV, Mirageman

We need Mirageman, he's the sort of
superhero we could use around here

I do what I can to defend people,

I do good just like he does

but I can't be alone and

I sent him an offer a

while ago, I sent an e-mail saying I had two
bikes in perfect condition, ready to be used

so I'd like him to get motivated
and call me so we can go into action

When we pointed out that his deeds along with
Mirageman's are mediocre and don't matter

Pseudo Robin reacted

What do you mean?

Didn't you see me guarding that car

from those people stealing the radio?

Don't talk nonsense, I'm getting bored of it

How can you crap on a superhero
who's only trying to do good?

You have to draw the line somewhere

Thank you very much
Let me see that for a bit

I want to send a message to
all the thugs, the gangsters

that they should take care because

if Mirageman isn't here
than I am, so be careful

The kidnapping of our
reporter Carol Valdivieso

has the whole network in an uproar

In the following video Mirageman
is challenged to rescue her

Mirageman, this message is for you

We have someone of
interest to you in our power

You only have 10 hours to rescue her

Check your e-mails

You have until tomorrow night to come for her

If you don't show up, she dies

If I see a single cop, she dies

I'm not a coward that
will meet you with a gun

I'll beat you like you deserve so
that your defeat will really hurt

Mission 29

Mirageman and Pseudo Robin
Rescue Carol Valdivieso

Mirageman, I have to confess something

I'm not a black belt, I'm just a beginner

Cover me

Thank you

If you come in for a few
minutes I'll bandage that up

Come in

Come in, take it easy

Sorry about the mess, it's been a rough day

Come on, I'm alone,

come on

Would you like something?

Sit down

I'm going to look for some alcohol and cotton

Make yourself at home

Let me see you, me, just me

The camera can't tape you, let me see you

And tomorrow, what the whole
country has been waiting for,

Mirageman the vigilante has returned

and he was caught on our network's cameras

Don't miss it tomorrow, the
year's television phenomenon,

Mirageman captured on Channel 10's cameras

The most shocking reality show ever made

We hired the best fighters in the country and
you'll see them face off against Mirageman

in real fights, yes ladies
and gentlemen, real fights

And also, an exclusive,

Carol Valdivieso and Mirageman:
Romance and Betrayal

If you want to know who Mirageman is,
tune in to Channel 10 tomorrow at 10

And coming up, don't miss up
the behind the scenes footage

of the reality show Mirageman

with interviews with the
fighters that faced him,

a detailed analysis of his performance

and conjectures about his identity

This will be the second time I've
saved your life Maco Gutierrez,

or would you prefer I call you Mirageman?

Easy man,

I'm here to help you

My name is Moli, Juan Moli

Don't worry, no one knows about you

I've taken care of manipulating
information so you aren't discovered

I want you to know something man,

I believe in you, I believe in what you do,

and if you agree to work with me

I'll make sure no one learns your identity,

I'll give you access to important information

I'll be your...

your guardian angel

I know how you feel Maco,

with a whole country mocking you,

but that was always a possibility, right?

Or did you think that the
media would take you seriously?

You know Maco,

you're the man with the most
guts I've ever met, I admire you

and I think you shouldn't quit

For the first time I saw people
let go of their fear, grasp hope,

don't abandon them,

don't let them be afraid again

Show them all you're real

You know, I've made a lot of
progress on the pedophile case

I think we have a chance to
finish them off now, right now

Mirageman,

we can save a child

Don't give up the fight

Don't give up on her

Mission 30

Mirageman vs
The Pedophile Ring

Take 2

Run

Good evening

We open todays news

with a moving story

Mirageman, our national hero,

gave his life to rescue a six year old girl

Carol Valdivieso, who followed
his career from the beginning,

tells us what happened

In the early hours of the
morning in this very place,

Mirageman, after destroying the
pedophile ring, was murdered

However, his remains
have still not been found

though they are believed to
be at the bottom of this tank

He never sought anyone's recognition, he
helped while asking for nothing in exchange

and he even gave his life so
that justice could be served

This man, after being the
national laughingstock,

vindicates himself today by
carrying out the most heroic

act in recent decades in our country

In the interview I had with him I asked
him why he decided to become a superhero

and he said that

I opened his eyes

I'd like to take this moment
to ask for forgiveness

publicly

for having been involved in this

If I did it it's because
it was part of my job

and because I thought it was the right thing

Maybe I realized things too late

I tried...

I tried to find you Mirageman,
and wherever you may be

perhaps you didn't read the e-mail I wrote

where I asked for your forgiveness

for having tarnished your image

and where I thanked you for being the
only one who had ever seen your eyes

I swear to keep the secret

and believe me when I say you were very noble

in your struggle for justice
