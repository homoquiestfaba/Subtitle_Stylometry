[horse neighing]

[tense music]

Howdy, there.

Good morning.

Hey, I wonder what
this alfalfa desperado's

got in them boxes?

[man] I'm not a farmer.
My mistake.

What are you then?

I'm a businessman.


Where are you from?

I was born in Europe.

So that's why
you talk like that.

Hey, this stuff looks costly.

Come over here and look at this.

Don't open any
more boxes, please.

[tense music]

Get down,

now!

Now!

If you haven't figured by now,

we're gonna be taking
your wagon and your supplies.

[blows thudding]
[men grunting]

[intense music]

Your friend is bleeding.

You should help him.


Don't follow me.

[indistinct chattering]

[horse neighing]

Good afternoon, sir.

I don't mean to
intrude on your day.

You're not.

Would you be so kind to direct
us to the sheriff office?

Tell you what, I'll take
you there myself, Marshal.

That would be
greatly appreciated.

You look very familiar.

You sure? Not many look like me.

That's true.

Are you sure
we haven't met before?

Don't think so, let's go.

I think we should expand first.

Build right there.

Huh?

Maybe a new school, so we don't
have to keep using the church.

We could do that,

but there aren't that many
children in Blind Chapel yet.

The church works
fine for their schooling.

I think we should consider the
expense of expansion, Sheriff.

That's why I'm
thinking about a sporting house,

a nice sized one,
hire lots of girls.

That way
we have a sporting house

that gets real
big in the territory,

draws a big crowd every night.

Huh?

A lot better money in that.

The church-going folk
ain't gonna like that, Mayor.

They will when
their wallets get fattened.

Trust me, Sheriff. [chuckles]

Ivan, what can I do for you?

This man needs to
speak to you, Sheriff.

I'm Marshal Austin Carter,

pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

Sheriff Vernon Kelly.

This is Mayor Bowman.

This is Deputy Walker,

our prisoner, Ethan Crawley.

We are escorting him
to the town of San Antonio

to face trial for mass murder.


[Mayor Bowman] I've heard of
Ethan Crawley, too.

Why'd you bring this
fiend to our town, Marshal?

To be honest with you,

I've been riding for
quite a while, all night.

The deputy and
I would like to get a meal

and maybe
a couple hours of rest.

Sheriff, if you don't mind,

we'd like to keep our prisoner

in your jail during that time.

[Mayor Bowman] Not a chance.

This man's a leader
of the Hellhound Gang,

a bunch of cutthroats.

They're monsters,
ghouls, even cannibals.

They used to ride
with the Quantrill Raiders,

killer of men,
women, and children.

They used to
burn down entire towns.

That's all we need to know.

Now just a damn minute, Mayor.

I'm not gonna be some
coffee boiler for a sheriff.

The law gets
respect in this office.

You can lock
your prisoner up here.

Greatly appreciated, Sheriff.

Do you have any
idea what you just did?

My job.

Crawley ain't going nowhere.

I'll keep a keen eye on him.

You better pray
nothing bad happens.

Your job depends on it.
Oh, yeah?

Who you gonna
run against me, Mayor?

[tense music]

[Mayor Bowman]
Everybody listen up.

No one breathes a word
of this to any of our citizens.

Is that understood?

You son of a Jezebel.

Thank you.

to get you in trouble, Sheriff.

Don't worry about Mayor Bowman.

I'm used to him pitching a fit,
he's always like this.

Not always,
sometimes he's worse.

[Deputy Walker]
Being that this town is

so close to the Rio Bravo line,

one might assume
it's got a border name.

That's what I thought
when I first arrived here.

How to get to be
being called Blind Chapel?

Hell, I ain't never
even heard of it.

I've been told the town's
first preacher was snake bitten,

and went blind.

He died a few days later.

The townfolk named
town Blind Chapel,

in tribute to him.


We have a new one now.

What's troubling you, Marshal?

Your mayor is
a little bit excited.

Yeah, everything he said

about Ethan Crawley
and his gang is true.

They're the most vile
collection of miscreants

one could imagine.

And I can guarantee

they're gonna want
their leader returned.

As you could assume,
we're just a little distrustful

of our environment at all times.

You know a place
where we can dine and repose?

Right there, the best biscuits
and gravy I've ever had.

And the meal is free,
as long as you order a beer.

Oh, I think we could do that.

Will you join us, sir?

As long as you call me Ivan.

I can do that, Ivan.

If this ain't the best biscuits
and gravy I've ever had,

then I don't know what is.

It might be kind
to your digestion

if you ate a little bit slower.

Aw, hell Marshal. I could eat
off the same plate as a rattler

and my gut would be just fine.

Where are you from, originally?

La France.

You seem to be an educated man.

Where did you study, Ivan?

Military academy.

That's impressive.

Myself, I was homeschooled
by my mother,

and I can tell you she was
a stickler about education.

What about your father?

He was shot dead
by a drunken man.

I was nine.

I'm sorry to hear that.

Tell you the truth,

that's what gave me the
motivation to become a lawman.

By the way, how did
you manage to catch Crawley?

Well, mostly luck.

I got tipped off by
a whorehouse boss

that Crawley had the lustful
urge for one of his ladies.

We went there and
recognized the two guys

in front of his bedroom door.

We sent both of
them in the boneyard.

That we did. And we caught
Crawley naked in bed,

and we placed him under arrest.

You should have seen
the old nanny he was with.

She looked like
the hind end of a buzzard.

[men laughing]

[Deputy Walker] She did.

How is everything?

Ma'am, if you fix
these biscuits and gravy,

I'd like to ask you to marry me.

Our cook is
actually an old, grouchy man,

who drinks too much whiskey.

And I'm sorry,
but he's already spoken for.

Well. [chuckles]

How is your day, Arlene?

No complaints,
but I'd like to see you

in here more often.

Would you like anything else?

I think we done. Thanks, Arlene.

Have you seen Vernon today?

I'm thinking about
bringing him some supper.

I think you should
wait till little later, Jenny,

he's busy at the moment.

[tense music]

[church bell ringing]

What's going on, Sheriff?

These men are Pinkerton agents.

Hello, Marshal.

We're here to escort
your prisoner, Ethan Crawley,

the rest of the way to
the San Antonio prison.

[tense music]

Do you mind if
I see your paperwork?

Not at all.

Here.

Our orders.

[music continues]

How did you know
Crawley was in Blind Chapel?

Marshal here
telegraphed us from Grand Ridge

and asked for our assistance.

We figured
the Marshal and his deputies

would be to your town by now.


I telegraphed
a request for assistance

from the Pinkerton Agency.

But I thought that you would
meet us on the trail

before we reached
the town of Blind Chapel.

Plans change.

I'm not going to
release my prisoner

until we reach
the town of San Antonio.

No problem, we'll ride together.

[guns firing]
[men grunting]

[woman screaming]


I'll shoot her.

I'm gonna shoot
this bitch, I swear.

[gun firing]
[woman screaming]

[dramatic orchestral music]

[woman screaming]

I told you Crawley's gang
was coming back, didn't I?

This is just the beginning,
mark my words!

They know he's here,
and they're coming back.

This is your fault.

[dog barking]


he's a strange bird,

but he's right about one thing.

If my Hellhounds
return to free me,

you are all
gonna be buzzard food.

You shut your mouth.


Vernon, shoot Crawley
if he tries anything, okay?

I'll do exactly that, Ivan.

[horse neighing]
[dark music]

[kicking door]

Ivan, I heard shooting,
what happened?

We need Doc Adams.
He left about a half hour ago

to make some
house calls outside of town.

Then you will help us, Nora.


You're hurt, too.

I'm fine.
No, you're not.

Sit down, Marshal.

[dramatic music]


Nora?

I can't help him.

What do you mean?

let alone a surgeon,

but he--he's too far gone.


There's nothing to be done?

Is there any way
we can get him to the doctor?

Would he make it?

[somber music]

I'm so sorry.


Deputy Dennis Walker
was a good man.

He was a loyal friend,

and a great deputy.

You'll be missed, my friend.

Please, sit down, Marshal.

Please.


It looks like the bullet
just tore through the flesh

and nothing more,
but you're bleeding badly.

I need to close that wound.

Here, drink this.

It'll numb the pain.
Go on.

How do you feel?

It works pretty fast.

Take hold of the Marshal.

It's important he keeps still.

Got it.

[eerie music]

[man chuckles] Lookie here.

Excuse me, Captain.

The colonel is
still in Blind Chapel.

What the hell happened?

I was watching
from across the street.

Everything seemed fine at first.

Your two men had the Pinkerton
gear and the papers,

and got inside the sheriff's
office, as you planned.

There was also the Sheriff,

a Marshal and
his deputy and, well...

Well what, woman?

Well, there was also
this big German, or Russian,

biggest son of
a bitch I've ever seen.

Then something occurred,
I could not see what,

but your two men
draw down on them.

Looked like Jackson was first,

but this big German or
Russian went batshit crazy.

Both your men are dead.

I was lucky he did not see me.

I might have been dead too.

Son of a bitch.

Thanks, Daniela.

Tell the girls
down at the whorehouse

we'll be down to
see 'em real soon.

Here's a little bonus for you.

<i>Esta bien, gracias.</i>

God damn it.

[tense music]

Did you lie to me,
Pinkerton man?

Did you lie to me about
who you was gonna meet?

Now you said you was
gonna meet the Marshal,

and deputy, and the sheriff.

Is that right?

So who's this big Russian
or German son of a bitch?

I don't know. [choking]

No?
No.

How about I cut
your goddamn pecker off?

No! [sobbing]

Please, I don't know anything.

Please don't.
I swear I don't know anything.

You don't know anything?

[choking]
You are no good to me at all.

Okay.
Sir?


[dramatic music]


Get up!

[indistinct chattering]

[man] Come on, boy.
Give him a knife.

Sir.

Pick it up,
you yellow Yankee bastard.

Pick it up or I'll kill you
where you stand.

[Captain grunts]
[man gasps]

[all laughing]

[intense music]

[indistinct chattering]

[lows thudding]
[men grunting]


Back up, boys.

[music continues]

[Captain laughing]

Look at me.

[choking, gasping]

I must say, nurse Nora,
you do meticulous work.

Thank you, Marshal.

But I'm not really a nurse.

I just have some
experience from the war,

that and
watching the doctor at work.

I never seen anyone being
so accurate with a handgun.

I had some training, Marshal.

Just some?

A lot.
[Marshal] That's it.

Now I remember.

It was during the war
when we were introduced.

Nora, may I present to you,

Union Brigadier General,
John Basil Turchin.

What's he talking about, Ivan?

I'm talking about how no one

can hold a candle
to this man in courage.

He saved our hides twice

from the Confederate
army in Chickamauga.

Sergeant Austin Carter,
Third Division.

It's an honor to
see you again, General.

[grand music]

Is that all true, Ivan?

It was war, Nora.

I had a job to do.
You were a general?

Yes.
How come you never

told anyone in town about it?

I was a soldier then.
The war is over.

Yes, but a General?

That's all anyone in Blind
Chapel needs to know, Nora.

Samuel, where are you?


What is it, Ivan?

You got the bodies
from the shootout already.

Yeah, some locals and I did.

Why, what's wrong with that?

Did you find any
personal belongings on them?

No.

You're sure about that?

Sir, are you
accusing me of thievery?

Do I have to, Samuel?

Do you know how hard
it is to make money at this job?

Hardly no one dies around here.

Did you find anything or not?

Nothing valuable.

That's not what
I ask you, Samuel.


Where is it?

Here.

Nothing more than that,
except a few gold teeth.

You can keep the teeth, Samuel.

Thank you,
that's so nice of you.

Where are they?
Blasted teeth.

Here, now, I--

May I keep--

Have a good day.

Get that whiskey.


I brought
you late breakfast, Vernon.

Is this a bad time?

No, it isn't,
this is fine, Jenny.

It's your favorite.

Sure is.

How are things
over at the palace?

The gunfire slowed
business down for a bit,

but it's picked up since then.

I'm glad to hear it.

I know how hard you work.

So do you, you're
the hardest working man I know.

[horse neighing]

I can't wait to dig in.

Mm, delicious.

[Jenny] Is it warm enough?
It is.

isn't that something?

The sheriff and
the painted lady,

fancy each other.

You shut your damn mouth.

She ain't no painted lady.

Don't pay
attention to that pole cat.

earlier interrupt your business,

whatever shady
business that might have been?

Anyway, that's nothing
compared to what's gonna happen.

Just ask
your lovey man over there.

You're all gonna be in
a peck of trouble, huh?

What's he mean by that?

What he means is
he's gonna get my boot

up his maggot ass unless
he shuts his fucking mouth.

Vernon!

Sorry for my temper, Jenny.

But that deuce can't
be believed for nothing.

I know the type
of men like that.

Speaking of men,
I heard of Vernon Kelly,

but he was a hard case.

He was mean enough to steal
a coin from a dead man's eye.

And he was so quick
to pull his fucking iron,

Jenny, and he had a Colt
just like your man over there.

Have you ever heard of him?

I have heard of
that Vernon Kelly.

And I know for
a fact he changed his ways

and became a good man.

And now he's on
the right side of the law.

Yeah.

That's exactly what he's doing.

You two ought
to charge for that show.

[tense music]

[indistinct chattering]

What's the matter
with you people?

You didn't hear
the gunfight earlier?

You think everything
is right as rain now?

Ethan Crawley
is sitting in our jail,

and his notorious,
bloodthirsty Hellhound Gang

are gonna come to
our town and free him.

If you wanna stay
here and get slaughtered,

that's fine with me,
but I recommend you leave town,

you board up
your businesses and you hide.

Now let's go!

[tense music]

It all appears legitimate.

Which means
Crawley's gang captured

the Pinkerton agents
you were expecting.

And they made them talk.

And that's how they deduced
we would be in Blind Chapel.

Yes.
[Marshal] Perhaps I should

take Crawley right now,

and cut a path to San Antonio.

You wouldn't make
it, they would get you.

Does this town
have a telegraph office?

It's presently not working.

Would any of the town folks
be willing to assist us?

I don't know.

Nothing like this has
ever happened here before.

[church bell ringing]
[people yelling]


[tense music]

[intense music]

Bless you.

Good to see you, Alice.
Take shelter, everyone.

What's going on, preacher?
Haven't you heard?

The Hellhound Gang,

they're--they're coming
to free Ethan Crawley.

Who told you that?

Mayor Bowman told everyone.

I don't know what else to do
but hide as many of my flock

as I can inside the church.

You're welcome to
join us if you'd like, Ivan.

I can't.

[soft music]


we're gonna get much help,
Jenny.

Well, they're all afraid,
Vernon.

[horse neighing]

[eerie music]

[coyote howling]

Men,

they got our Colonel
down there in their jail.

We gonna let
'em keep our Colonel?

[men] No!
Hell no, we ain't.

We're gonna bring hell
down on them shit heels.

I want you to ride in there
and shoot everything that moves.


After we thin out their numbers,

we gonna march on
that jail and free our Colonel.


[dramatic music]

Mount up. Let's go.

[indistinct chattering]

[ominous orchestral music]

What are you all so glum about?

Afraid my Hellhounds
gonna butcher everybody in town?

Don't waste your breath.

Says the blue-bellied General.

Oh, that's right.

I suddenly remember
where I know you from.

You are that scoundrel General

John Basil Turchin.

Do I say it right? I don't want
to insult you, you know.

General John here
led a pack of scorchers.

He used to set towns on fire.

Any of you ever
heard of the Rape of Athens?

Did you tell 'em about
your court martialing yet?

I was fighting a war.

You rode with
Quantrill and his cowards

who killed for pleasure.

I remember the Lawrence Massacre

committed by
Quantrill's Raiders.

That was a disgusting act.


You really think so, huh?

Well, I kind of liked it.

[dark music]

Not gonna use your rifle?

I work better at
close range with these.

I got something
here that works just fine.

All yours.

Well,

wow. [chuckles]

I can raise Cain with this.

So how should we do this?

Well, you are the general.

What's your plan?

Agreed, let's hear it, Ivan.

Okay.

You two stay here.

Don't let him out of your sight.

And if the Hellhounds
get inside, just kill him.

Will do.

Girls, you should
get out of here.

Stay with Nora.

It's safe over there.

I don't wanna leave you.

You can't be here, Jenny.

Please, do what Ivan says.

Ladies, just go to
the doctor's office, please.

Come on, Jenny.

Let's go.

[tense music]

It's loaded.

Wait, you don't
want any firearms?

No, I have my own.


Listen, I don't give a pig's
ass what happened in the war.

But I've seen you in action.

You know what you're doing.

But just between you and me,

I get the feeling we got
our hair in the butter bad

with these Hellhounds.

Probably.

You ever been up
against these kinda odds?

Many times.


If you want to beat the enemy,

you have to do
everything better.

If they're strong,
you have to be stronger.

If they fight hard,
you have to fight even harder.

What if they're monsters?

Anyone can be
a monster, you'd be surprised.


I used to be one a while back.

I reckon today
I'll have to be one again.

No, you have to be the Sheriff.

That's who you are.

Keep your town safe.

Keep your prisoner behind bars.

That's your duty.

Even if it means being ruthless.

Well, in that case, why don't
I just go back in there

and cut down
Crawley where he stands?

I thought about
doing the same thing.

Well, why in the hell don't you?

Two reasons.

First, it won't stop
the Hellhounds from coming here.

And second, most importantly,
Crawley deserves to be hanged.

It'd sure be nice
seeing him swinging

from the end of a rope.

It sure will, Sheriff.

[dog barking]

[acoustic guitar music]

[sinister music]

When did you get all this?

Over the years.
You know how to shoot?

Ever since I was young,
my parents made sure of it.

How about you, Arlene?

[tense music]

Aim, and pull the trigger?

Right,

but it needs to be loaded first.

Here, I'll show
you how, it's easy.

Jenny?

I've fired a gun before,
Vernon showed me how.

Good.

Ivan?

[dog barking]

say anything about the war?

I told you Nora,
it's nobody's business.

What are you hiding?

Nothing.

You're not a good liar.

I'm not lying to you.

Then tell me what
happened in the war.

Why?

Because
you need to tell someone.

It's eating you alive.

Did you ever hear
about the Rape of Athens?

I heard some things about it.

My regiment took
control of Athens, Alabama.

But to be honest with you,
the only thing I was doing,

I was watching my brave men
get picked off one by one,

not just by Confederates,

but by the town folks as well.

That must have been awful.

It was a nightmare,

and I couldn't
stop it from happening.

What'd you do?

I lost my temper.

One day I said to my troops
that I'm going to close my eyes.

Won't see nothing for two hours.

So I left the city and
they ransacked all of Athens.

A lot of
that happened in the war.

But I was a Colonel in
charge of all 19th Regiment.

Some military square heads,
they didn't like what I did.

So I was court martialed, Nora.

And I said to the court,

that you cannot fight
slavers with soft gloves.

It turned out President Lincoln
heard about me and my trial.

So he reinstated me and promoted
me to Brigadier General.

Well,

then that's that.

You were in the right.

Some people don't think so.


I can't say I disagree.

But it was war.

It was war.

That's what I keep
telling myself, Nora.

But it's the truth.

You were just
trying to protect your men

during a time of madness.

Just like you're
trying to protect all of us now

from Crawley's gang.

I'm not so sure, Nora.

Guess what?

I am.

[dog barking]

No matter what
happens outside, stay hidden.

Don't let
Crawley's gang find you.

What if they do?

Just make sure they don't.

Are you saying we might
have to use these on ourselves?

No, use it on anyone
who comes through this door.

Ivan?

Come back alive.

You know what I'm thinking?

There's gonna be one hard
killing time coming up soon.

Yes, and it's highly unlikely
you will see the end of it.

Unless of course,
we all survive.

In that case,

we will escort you to
the town of San Antonio to hang.

[tense music]
[church bell ringing]

Those are some future
plans you got there, Crawley.

[Crawley chuckling]

[eerie music]

So, you think
you're ready for us, do you?

[men chuckling]

[tense music]

[horses galloping]

[intense music]

[music continues]

Jenny, you take the window.

Go.

[intense orchestral music]

[tense music]

No! [sobbing]

[gun firing]

[woman gasping]

[man chuckles] Lookie here.

You think you're the first
man to ever point a gun at me?

[woman screaming]

[woman shouts indistinctly]

[woman screaming]

[man whimpering]

[dire orchestral music]

[gun firing]

[wood creaking]
[tense music]

[gun firing]

[gun firing]

[gun firing]

[gun firing]

You go over there.

You go up the stairs.

[gun firing]

[ominous orchestral music]

[guns firing]

[guns firing]

[gun firing]

[music continues]

[gun firing]

Stay here,
I'm gonna check on the door.

[Jenny yelping, grunting]

[intense music]

[guns firing]

Jenny.

Son of a bitch,
I can't stand this.

Watch Crawley.

[tense music]

Good luck with that.

There he is.
[guns firing]

[gun firing]

[gun firing]

Get down.

You're a pretty one, aren't ya?

We're gonna have fun.




[gun firing]

[dramatic music]

[gun firing]


Protect Jenny.

We will, Ivan.

[horse neighing]

[ominous music]

[gun firing]
[men grunting]

[intense orchestral music]

[music continues]

[gun firing]

[guns firing]

It hurts.

Relax your breathing
the best you can, Jenny, okay?

Okay?
You're gonna be okay.


[tense music]

[gasping]
[Nora] Sorry.

Okay, just hold still, okay?

I need to close the wound.
[Jenny] Okay. [indistinct]


She'll be okay.

Promise, okay?


Sheriff, it's me,
Reverend Andrew.

I'm in a bit of a--
bit of a bind,

there's someone here who wants
to talk to you about it.

[tense music]

Sheriff Kelly?

Don't you think
you ought to talk

to the preacher man, Sheriff?

Talk to the preacher
and see what he wants.

Are you all right, preacher?


Now, let's just
have us a talk here.

No shooting at
each other for a minute.

Just so you know,
we found your town folk.

Yeah, they're all down
there hiding in the church.

Now who the hell does that?

Hide the town folk
in a goddamn church?

You oughta be
ashamed of yourselves.

What do you want?

We want Colonel Crawley.

Well, we ain't
gonna give 'im to you.

Well now, that's not good.

'Cause if you don't,

I'm gonna torch
that church and everybody in it.

We're gonna
shoot this preacher dead.

I'm not gonna
dicker with you shit heels.

You do what I say right now,

or you know what's gonna happen.

[tense music]

Unless you already
killed my Colonel, did you?

Colonel Crawley,
can you hear me?

Are you all right?

Never been better,
Captain Grady.

I don't know what to do.

We can't release
Crawley to them.

We can't.

I can't just let
my whole town die.

You can't trust them,

I promise you they will
kill the town anyway.

What's it gonna be?

I ain't gonna wait much longer.

Goddamn good work,
Captain Grady.

Thank you, sir.

Where is everyone?

Dead, sir.

Except for private Oakley and me

and Corporal Waters
down at the church.

This town's got this big
dumb German or Russian,

whatever the hell
he is, he just won't die.

He killed every
man I've thrown at him.

He's a Russian,

and he's crazy enough to
eat the devil with his horns.

And he's no other than
General John Basil Turchin.

The Rape of Athens general?

That one.

Now let me ask you a question.

Do you think that son of a
bitch, Turchin, is still alive?

I don't know, sir.

[tense music]

Threw every man we had
at him, he killed 'em all.

And now we have no men.

Afraid not sir, other
than what I told you about.

But I ain't seen
that Russian in a while,

they might have got him.

Somehow I don't think so.

Send the preacher over here.

You get that preacher
and your town folks back

when I'm riding out
of this horseshit town.

How about you both
just toss your guns out here?

Well, then we'll just be

hanging on to
the preacher for a while.

Try to follow us,
he's a dead man.

You close that goddamn door
and you stay inside,

or I'm gonna burn
down that chapel myself.

You understand what I'm saying?

Let's go, come on.

[ominous orchestral music]

Release the preacher.

Preacher, thank
you so much for your services.

Now let's look at this
beautiful chapel you built.

Town folks
waiting there for you.

You know what I think?

What?

I think you should join them.

[dramatic orchestral music]

You should join them in hell.

[gun firing]

[dire orchestral music]

What do you wanna
do about that, sir?

I say we torch the church.

Town folks inside,

have a look.

This,

this is what hell looks like.

[people whimpering, shouting]

[gun firing]

[gun firing]

Bet you never thought you'd go
out like this, did you asshole?

[gun firing]

[gun firing]

[ominous orchestral music]

You are [indistinct] wolf
when it comes to killing.

I gotta hand you that.

Not a bullet left.

So you gonna
kill an unarmed man?

Is that what
you are, a Russian coward?

[tense music]

[intense orchestral music]

[music continues]

[acoustic guitar music]

[gun firing]

[Crawley groaning]

I told you, we're both killers.

You and me,

we are the same.

No, we're not.

I greatly appreciate you

volunteering to
go along, General.

I want to see justice served.

So do I.

with you Marshal,

but I've got this
town to look after,

and I don't think
the Mayor's coming back.

At least I hope not.

Hope to see you one day.

Likewise.

Watch yourself, General.

I will.
