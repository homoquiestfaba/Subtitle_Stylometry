<i><u>The Swan Princess</u></i>

<i><u>Mistery of the Enchanted Kingdom</u></i>

Yeah!
I love my new home.

Love sitting in my favorite spot.

Down by the bubbling brook.

Sing it with me.

Eating lovely nuts...

You just stick in your beak
and crack it in two...

Sometimes it's hard cos the shells
are tough and I'm gonna give it up

Then chuck it in the bubbling brook.

What a place I found!
Not a care in the world!

It's a bird's dream, really.

Oh great! It's over. No more
living a life variety for me.

I'm getting out of here.

Come on, legs,
don't fail me now!

What am I running for? I should be
flying for crying out loud! I'm a bird!

Come on, men!
Pull!

Come on, let's see the spirit
of festival days!

<i>What a glorious day!</i>

<i>It's true when we say it
doesn't get any better than this...</i>

<i>All the best in the land  are here
showing their hand and we're sure</i>

<i>That the best is here.</i>

<i>We can dance like the wind...</i>

<i>Play a wizard's violin.</i>

<i>And do tricks of incredible risk...</i>

<i>It doesn't get any better than this...</i>

It needs to come up just a little.

That's perfect.

Hallelujah, Odette.

You brought culture and
refinement to the festival.

Now thinking men have an alternative
to that mindless obstacle course.

Well placed window!

<i>Judging horses and lambs,
unicorns, goats and rams.</i>

<i>And I hope it gets better than this...</i>

<i>Of all the grace in the kingdom I know that the queen will rise up to the top of the list...</i>

<i>Displays of wit and finesse
we have lacked, I confess.</i>

<i>But now, we have all that we missed.</i>

<i>It doesn't get any better than this...</i>

<i>Derek's brought us peace and
set us solidly so we can sing now...</i>

<i>We're gonna save a life the way
a man and wife are supposed to do.</i>

<i>All the clouds have banished now that
fear is banished from the kingdom.</i>

<i>And so to celebrate we'll show
the world how great we are...</i>

<i>Hit the mark.</i>

<i>Ring the bell.</i>

<i>Kiss them all and live to tell.</i>

<i>It doesn't get any better than this...</i>

<i>Also trumpets and troupers,
those lions and wild boars...</i>

<i>Once you taste them
you just can't resist.</i>

<i>It doesn't get any better than this...</i>

<i>Daggers and dungeons,
dragons and wars...</i>

<i>Arrows and aligators fought us.</i>

<i>We've overcome every
possible foe...</i>

<i>What a bravery has brought us.</i>

<i>Now there's nothing that can
spoil the fun of festival days.</i>

You gotta try this, Brom.

Best obstacle course we've
ever had.

Not dangerous enough for
my taste..

I'll add a snake pit if you
promise to partake.

Well, I...

I'll take that as a yes.

But Derek...

Come on, Brom...

Winner gets to be
prince for a day.

<i>Dealing with the danger all my life.
It's second nature to revel it.</i>

<i>But now, that the final victory is
ours, I think it's time we celebrate it.</i>

<i>Now there is nothing that can
spoil the fun of festival days.</i>

Get me out of here!

<i>Feed the crowd, shout horray...</i>

<i>as a crowned prince for a day.</i>

<i>It doesn't get any better than this...</i>

<i>There is only one kingdom</i>

<i>where this kind of dream could
come true.</i>

<i>Throw your cares to the wind,
let the party begin.</i>

<i>It may be years till
we see something like this...</i>

<i>It doesn't get any better than...</i>

<i>Or any wetter than</i>

<i>This double head can see
anything better...</i>

<i>It doesn't get any better than this.</i>

My name is Zelda.

I'm only going to tell you
this once, so listen carefully!

Yes, yes, of course.

Many years ago
after being banished

for developing the forbidden arts...

Rothbart came to the castle
at Swan Lake.

Vanquished and powerless he
lived in despair.

Until I found him.
I roused his spirit.

Inspired him to begin a new.

I awakened the sleeping evil
genius within.

And after years of work, the fruit
of our labor finally appeared.

Finally. The forbidden arts
are mine again.

Now we will rule as
king and queen.

Actually, I had a different plan.

I'm gonna force Odette
to marry me.

Of course, it cuts you out of plan.

You wouldn't have the forbidden
arts if it weren't for me.

True. And, yet, sadly
you're out of here.

Those notes belong to me just
as much as they belong to you.

More! And they
will be mine someday!

They will be mine!

Get out!

I have a feeling those notes
still exist.

And you're going to
help me get them.

Excuse me.
May I just mention

that I have absolutely no talent
for this particular kind of adventure.

On the contrary.

The yaki bird can imitate any
voice after hearing it only once.

Do mine!

But I don't think...

Do my voice!

Do it again!

Do it again!

Go to the castle at Swan Lake

and find out if those notes
still exist, my little spy.

Spy? No, see, spies
get captured and tortured.

I couldn't bear torture. I start
sobbing if I even get a canker sore.

Stop whining.

As soon as you found out if the
notes exist, I promise to set you free.

Seek out Whizzer and
bring him to me.

My little seekers are a far
cry from the forbidden arts.

But they can find you
no matter where you go.

So don't ever try to run and
don't you ever betray me!

Now go find out
about those notes.

47, 48, 49, 50.

Look!

You mean those little bumps?

These little bumps are going to
help me win the obstacle course.

You're gonna enter the
obstacle course?

That's right, Mr. "inch-at-a-time"

And when I am
crowned prince for a day

Finally, the people will see me as
a prince forever.

If you don't mind, it's time
to work on my mental fitness.

You can say that again.

The next one who disturbs me
shall be punished by these babies.

Run away, run away!

Jean-Bob you know anything about Rothbart's notes being hidden in the castle?

Okay, that's it!

Every day, in every way,
I just get better and better. No?

It doesn't bother me, of course.

But some people think the
obstacle course is too dangerous.

Rothbart's notes on a
forbidden arts

were they hidden in the castle?

Who told you that?

Well, everybody's
talking about it.

Derek... something
horrible has happened.

You can tell me in front of Odette.

I'm not sure.

Rogers, we have no secrets.

Actually, you do have one secret.

Go on, Rogers.

Yeah, go on.

Well there's a rumor going
around about Rothbart's notes.

That they're being hidden in the castle.

That's ridiculous. If we knew those notes
existed they'd destroyed immediately.

Actually Odette ...

You found Rothbart's formula
for the forbidden arts

and you didn't tell me?

I did not want you to worry.

You see, after Clavius was destroyed,

Rogers and I found this
underground chamber.

There were all sorts of things Rothbart left behind, including his formula for the forbidden arts.

I destroyed everything, of course

except Rothbart's notes.

I'm free.

Derek. How could you?

Apologize, Derek.

I really think that someday we
can use their power for good.

Derek, nothing good can
come from those notes.

You must destroy them.

You're right, Odette.
I will destroy them right away.

Rogers and I are the only
ones who know where they are.

But there's a rumor.

Look, even if someone did find them, they'd never figure them out without my help.

Apologize, apologize!

I would never put you in danger.

Promise me you will destroy
those notes, Derek!

I promise. I was careless,
foolish and selfish.

But I wasn't.

I did this for us.
For the kingdom.

Please just trust me, Odette!

Please, Rogers, no long speaches!

I only need two words: numb scull.

I am all free!

Now all I have to do
is get out of here.

Hold it!

Spying is a crime
in this kingdom.

So I here by claim you
as a prisoner of law.

Mommy, will you hold me?

Look at a smog check,
why don't ya?

Well I've looked on you, small fly.
You give up or else...

Zelda! Zelda!
The notes are there.

I knew they were there.
I knew it.

Great. The notes are there. Meanwhile, I got an ulcer the size of a watermellon.

Now, to get my hands on that chest.

At least it's done and I can
go back to my regular calm life.

Although, I'll probably gonna have nightmares the rest of my life of this little masquerade.

Masquerade...

So long, Zelda...
I'm leaving.

I think I'll do a little play.

I will play maiden in distress
from the far away north.

Break a leg!

The next time you need
a talking bird,

I understand parrots
are very dependable.

Not so fast.

There's a part for you too
in my little charade.

You promised to set me free.

How can I be a maiden in distress
without anyone to distress me?

We made a deal.
Now I'm making you another deal.

It's two deals in one day.
How many deals do you want?

Zeus boy, show some gratitude.

Good thing I checked this.
This cable is coming loose.

You should leave it that way.

Add to little danger and excitement
to a rather easy and boring ride.

Derek, we need to talk.

Rogers, old man.

You made it all the way to the top.

You're gonna make it all the way to
the bottom with that old man's stuff

As your counselor and friend, Derek

I beg you apologize to Odette.

You know you're going to
have to sooner or later.

Why do I always have to be
the one to apologize?

Because that's what we husbands do.

We hunt, we fish, we want
sporting events and we apologize.

I could never be married and give
up my days of living on the edge.

Excuse me, big silly braggart,
but I was talking to Derek.

You know she's right.
She's always right.

Now you're on her side? You kept
the secret too, you know.

I never felt good about it.

Well you should have
said something then.

You're the prince!

You're my counselor.
You're supposed to counsel me.

I'm supposed to support you.

That's my point.

He caught you on that one.
You've been disgraced, old man.

And yet, I leave in triumph.

Please, Derek, reconsider!

Reconsider what?

I'm right, aren't I?

Isn't it enough that
I fight the dragons?

That I fight the villains
and I win the prize?

Isn't it enough that
I run the kingdom?

Solve everyone's problems,

direct and advise?

Why must I also get down
on my knees and apologize?

<i>Because I love her,</i>

<i>I need her like
Earth needs the Sun...</i>

<i>I need the one I love
to keep my hope right, my head right,</i>

<i>my heart fighting on,
until I am back in her arms.</i>

<i>Because I love her, I need her,
like summer needs rain.</i>

<i>To grow and sustain each day...</i>

<i>I hear her singing and bringing
the strength to my soul</i>

<i>until I am back in her arms.</i>

<i>Miles apart, yet still my heart can
hear her melody.</i>

<i>I'm more than sure that I can't
endure without her love for me.</i>

<i>Because I love her, I need her,
like I need to breathe.</i>

<i>Did Adam need Eve like this?</i>

<i>Now I see clearly
I nearly gave up all I had.</i>

<i>So whatever our differences were
I'll bid them goodbye...</i>

<i>I'll give love a try and
all because I love her.</i>

Almost done.

Look at all these entries, Puffin.

I can't right now, princess.

My radar is searching for
enemy activity.

Frederick, I didn't know
you like to perform.

What will you do?
Song? A dance?

I juggle. Omelettes.

Wow, a real stage...

I've done it.

My body and mind are one.

If I can mantain this feeling,
the obstacle course is mine.

-Far longer than forever.
-I'll hold you in my arms...

I've come to enter the
talent show.

Certainly. Your name?

The Lady in Black.

-And your talent?
-The tango.

Oh, the tango.
Partner's name?

-I don't have one yet.
-Uberta?

No one can know it's me.

I want to win because I'm the
best, not because I'm the queen.

Oh, I see. I hope you can
find the partner in time.

I know someone who would
jump at the idea.

The tango? The tango's most
difficult dance known to man...

Rogers, you will help me
win this talent show.

Oh no, ma'am. A waltz,  maybe, a
nice foxtrot, but the tango. No way.

You're probably right. How silly of me to think that you could still do the tango.

Well, I didn't say I couldn't do it.

I guess even the greatest
dancers must grow old and stiff.

I'm not that old.

No, no, no. Please don't fight it,
Rogers. You must accept the truth.

Your muscles have become weak and flabby. You've the timing of a busted clock.

Now wait a minute!

Poor Rogers. You used to
move with such grace and style.

I still could, if I had a mind to.

No, no. you Must give in to the
truth. You're washed up.

Washed up?

You'll never do the tango again.

-Don't you count on it, my lady!
-No, no. Rogers.

-Orchestra!   -Don't!
-Hit it!

Who's washed up, chikita?
You ain't for sure!

Help!

Here he comes.
Come on, attack!

Help somebody!Help!

Hold on, madam!
I'll get the little beast.

Let him hit you, or else...!

Take that bat!

I hope you are alright!

Well I'm alright now
that you're here.

You were so brave.
So handsome too!

Even your long nose...

I am Zelda. From
Chut'n Chut'n Do Dang.

Chut'n Chut'n Do Dang?
I've never...

It's very far.
I've run away.

The evil king keep me in the castle
and make me play the accordion,

all day long.

Oh, you poor girl!

-What, what?
-The castle.

Help me. I'm so scared of castles.
Don't lock me up in the castle.

Oh my girl,
there's no reason to fear.

This is a good castle, I promise.
I will give you a tour myself.

I'll show you the whole thing,
from top to bottom.

If you promise,
then I guess it's fine,

Bridget, take this poor creature inside
and give her anything she needs!

You'll see we're a lot nicer than those
Chut'n Chut'n Do Dang is, any old day.

Don't you forget we've
got a talent show to win!

Now look, Rogers.

I'm not going to lose
because of your sorry love life.

Now snap out of it!

I want to but I think I can't...

Now, this particular room I
think you'll find very interesting.

-Originally it was used for...
-Cut the speech and open a door!

I'm so excited.
Will you forgive?

I will.

As I was saying,
this room was originally...

Nice.
Next room!

-But I didn't get to tell you.
-Please pumpkin! Next room.

Pumpkin? Anything you
say, muffin.

This next room... is nothing special.
Very boring.

What is in it?

Nothing. Little things, stuff and other
things. Now, if you'll just follow me...

No, Zelda.
You mustn't do that.

What Rogers honey don't
want me to see?

Nothing at all.

You shouldn't have done
that, Zelda.

-I'm so sorry.
-Well, you should be.

-You're mad at Zelda.
-No. You don't have to...

I could never be mad at you.

In Chut'n Chut'n Do Dang
if the girl loved a boy,

She show it in special way.

-You want to see?
-If you want to show me.

I love that girl.

I heard we have a special guest.

Her name is Zelda.
I think Rogers is in love.

Rogers in love?
This I gotta see.

Look Odette, there's
something I...

I was wrong to keep
Rothbart's notes .

Oh, Derek...
you will destroy them then?

-As soon as the festival's over.
-Don't wait till then, Derek! Please.

After the festival.
I promise.

Trust me!
Nothing will happen.

So I tell the king I will
not play accordion no more.

Yes. And so then? What did he
do, what did that awful king do?

The king, he grabbed me and say: "You must play accordion" and Zelda say "I won't"

Then the king, he shake
me and say: "You must..."

And then Zelda said: "No".
Then the king yell: "Guards"...

And then what happened? What
happened when the guards came?

Then I remembered
self defense technique.

And Zelda go...

Then Zelda run away
and then I come here...

We'll act out your story for
the talent contest.

Zelda, accordion slave.
It's a sure winner.

What a shame. It's getting
dark and you have to go.

-But she hasn't even eaten.
-Well thank heavens for doggy bags.

But she has no home.

Well she does now. I'm buying her one
at the northern end of the kingdom.

-But I want to stay.
-You are not safe here.

The Do Dangians
will come looking for you.

Oh, they'd never look here.

Of course they will. Those
Dang Do Dangians always do.

Come now, dear, the
carriage is leaving.

-Uberta!   - But I'm scared.
Rogers, help !

-Move it, you little tramp!
-Zelda !

Oh, my ankle!

Now look what you've done. She'll have to stay here now for at least a few days.

Poor little muffin.

I don't care if you are the king.

It's cruel to force someone
to play the accordion.

Hands off!

How dare you
treat Zelda that way?

Forget about me, Zelda. Run!
I'll take care of the guard.

Run, Zelda!

-Thanks a lot, pumpkin.
-You're welcome, muffin.

Gone. My muffin is gone.

How could she leave me?
We were in love.

No, wait, maybe I
misunderstood her letter.

Yes, that's it.
"Dear pumpkin, I hate you. Zelda"

Oh, that pain!

I guess her anckle wasn't
that bad after all.

You! You sent her
back, didn't you?

Rogers.

You sent her back to that
crazed accordion loving King .

-I would never!
-You!

You're monster!
You wolf in queen's clothing!

How dare you accuse me of
such things? I am a queen.

I always act with dignity.
Now, you shape up or I'll pop... !

Look on the bright side, Rogers! Now we can rehearse without any distraction.

Rehearse?
I feel like dying not dancing.

She's gone!

<i>She's gone and
with her the Sun and Moon.</i>

<i>And the stars have banished from sight,
shall never again be a sunrise for me,</i>

<i>Because she was my light.</i>

<i> No laughter will ever escape from
my lips ,I'll never again sing a song</i>

<i>for the light and love of my life
was Zelda.</i>

<i>And now she's gone.</i>

How pathetic, Rogers.

<i>She's gone and with her the greatest
love the world has ever known</i>

<i>has suffered a dagger right through the heart and lies as cold as tomb.</i>

<i>the passion of Romeo and Juliet,
Josephine and Napoleon</i>

<i>should have bowed to the
love of Rogers and Zelda.</i>

<i>But now she's gone.</i>

Get a grip, Rogers!
You're making me nauseous.

<i>Save your words of encouragement,
nothing can bring me cheer.</i>

<i>Take away all my life support
and bury me right here!</i>

If I didn't need a partner,
I swear I would.

<i>Now, little darling, won't you please come home and heal this broken heart?</i>

<i>Because your muffin man
he just can't stand the pain...</i>

<i>For the reason my world
had turned was Zelda...</i>

<i>No other love in history held her.</i>

<i>But now, she's gone...</i>

Rogers, this is your queen speaking.

You will regain consciousness
this instant

and remain conscious until
I win the talent show.

Or else...

Very well!
I have no other choice

but to take you to a castle and deal with you in a matter to which you are according!

Oh, my muffin play the accordion.

Your muffin's history, chump!

What kind of lock did he put
on this thing anyhow?

Finally.

I'm free. I'm free.

-I am free, aren't I?   -Yes. Go on, you
worthless mass of feathers!

I'm free.

Yes. The power to change.
The power to create.

And, finally... The greatest of them all,
the power to destr... What's this?

Someone's torn off the last word...

I'll never have the power
to destroy without it.

So, that's what Derek meant.

-Hello.
-Tell me what Derek said.

He said: "They'd never figure
them out without my help. "

The little whimp, tore it off himself.

He's hiding it somewhere.
He took what I wanted most of all.

He took what I love.

Well two can play this game.

"Dear Prince Derek, I have kidnapped
your sweet Odette, dot."

"If you want to see her alive again, comma, then meet me at the mouth of the Western River"

"with the missing section
of Rothbart's notes. "

"Exclamation, exclamation, exclamation! "

-Take this to Derek!
-But you said...

You know how many Yaki birds
would die to have just one deal?

Now you've got three.

Take it to Derek now!

I'll take care Odette.

Seek her out and bring her to me!

Will you hurry up, Jean-Bob?
It's getting late.

Don't rush me!

You know, I can't believe you made
Odette drive you all the way up here.

Just so you can practice
for the obstacle course.

It is the perfect spot.

I will swing across this ravine,
race down that slope,

swim the river,

hop those rocks,
then scale this cliff

before the last grain of
sand falls to the bottom .

I wish you wouldn't do this.

You can't change my mind, Odette.

If I must prove I'm a
prince, then so be it.

Ready?

Speaking of falling to
the bottom...

Don't you think that bind's
a little frazzle?

Record time.

What is that?

-Some kind of fast moving light thing...
-Thanks a lot, Mr Science.

Odette!

Hold on!

Here!

Sure, let the frog drive. Frogs are
known for their waggon driving!

Just a little more!

I don't like my options...

Everybody out!

I still don't like my options.

Odette!

Someone finds this funny?

-Who are you?
-I am Zelda, accordion slave.

You'll never get away with this.

Don't make her angry!

-Derek will come for me.
-Odette!

I hope so...

But it seems to take his time when
it comes to really important matters.

Such as destroying Rothbart's notes.

He can have you back,

as soon as he brings the little
piece he stole.

He'll never do it.

We know both Derek will give
me anything to save your life.

Even the power to destroy.

Face it, sister.
The forbidden arts are now mine .

You know, not all things are as bad as
they seem. But I'm pretty sure this is!

Odette?

Where is she?

Okay...

Next me pluck the duck.

Add a touch of basil.

A pinch of a rice... Oh yummy!

Frederick, have you seen Odette?

Not since she left in the carriage.

I hope you find her soon.
I'm making your favorite.

It used to be his favorite.

That's a good looking duck...

Odette?

No!

Derek... Derek, where are you?

Something foul is going on here...

And you're just the one
behind it all, aren't you?

I got you this time.
Give yourself up...

There's nowhere to hide...

You better enjoy your rest,

because when you wake up you've
got some explaining to do!

Just because I have to wait
for the power to destroy,

doesn't mean I can't enjoy
the power to create and change.

<i>I guess I've been naughty
and I've been bad.</i>

<i>I couldn't live well enough alone.</i>

<i>I dug up a horrible secret, you see
and I'm afraid I've made it my own.</i>

<i>It's something so wicked
I should often think</i>

<i>of the descipable deeds that I'll do.</i>

<i>Creating such chaos as you've never
seen and misery like you never knew.</i>

<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

<i>Ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

<i>So kiss up your happiness,
bury your dreams,</i>

<i>Embrace
this new feeling of dread...</i>

<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

<i>The power to change is mine!
All mine!</i>

<i> The first thing I'll
change is the wind.</i>

<i>Odette and Derek are soon going to find that I played them for sniveling fools.</i>

<i>From now on the kingdom
will hear what I say.</i>

<i>And whatever Zelda says - goes.</i>

<i>The world is my play thing,
my yo yo, my toy.</i>

<i>And I won't stop
till everyone knows.</i>

<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

<i>Ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

<i>I'm the badest of bad girls,</i>

<i>And now that I'm back
my cast is written in red...</i>

<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

<i>Are you scared?</i>

<i>All the fear.</i>

Overflowing is more like it.

<i>Will you run and hide?</i>

<i>Well ain't that a shme, cos honey
it's too darn late.</i>

<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

<i>Move over Medusa, Cruela, get lost!
Take a hike wicked Witch of the West!</i>

<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead, wonderfuly sad days, can you see my mad ways?</i>

<i>There ain't nothing but bad days ahead.</i>

What ?

I know how to teach you a lesson.

No.

Trap Odette!

Try that!

The same thing will happen to you
if you try to escape.

Anyone for barbcued frog legs?

If you won't act like you've
got a spine, Rodgers,

Then I'll give you one myself.

And that goes for all the rest
of the bones in your body too.

Try dripping now, Mr. Sniveling Pants.

Is that you, muffin?

No.

What will it take to bring
you to your senses?

Odette's been kidnapped.

What?!

Zelda used you to get the keys.

Oh that, that mean muffin!
Derek, I'm so sorry.

It's not your fault.

If I hadn't kept Rothbart's notes
none of this would have happened.

She wants some sort of ransom,
no doubt.

That's what I've come to get.

Derek, you can't give away the
secret to the forbidden arts.

You promised
to keep them safe.

I've fought the forbidden arts
before, and I'll fight them again.

But I am not going to lose Odette.

You can't fool me.

All this nice talk is just part
of the torture, I know it.

First you make think I'm not
gonna be tortured, sure.

Then you torture me anyhow.

I'm not stupid. I've been around
the block a few times, alright?

Look, Whizzer, we are
not gonna torture you.

All we want to know is how to
find Odette.

Please. You gotta help us.

I can't tell you.

She'll send one of those
fireballs after me.

She'll torture me way worse
than you ever could.

Believe me, she won't waste
time with the nice talk.

Who is she?

I've said too much.
Now she'll never let me go.

Oh, you bird brain!

Whizzer, my friend.

<i>You are prisoner forever when
you're trapped inside your fears,</i>

<i>Because you know that
what you're doing isn't right.</i>

<i>And you're never gonna change
that in a hundred million years,</i>

<i>Unless you change the
side for which you fight.</i>

<i>So trust a wing of friendship, believe
us when we say you'll feel  marvelous</i>

<i>The moment you decide
to do what's right and proper</i>

<i>You'll be free again.</i>

<i>Because there's no fear
when you're on the right side.</i>

<i>The right side where there's confidence
and wondrous piece of mind.</i>

That's the spirit, Whizzer.

<i>We can always persevere
whatever obstacles appear.</i>

<i>Because there's no fear
when you're on the right side.</i>

You guys are right. I'm gonna tell
you everything. What am I, crazy?

<i>If your feathers are quivering,
if you're shaking in yur shell,</i>

<i>then it's confidence you're
wanting that's for sure.</i>

<i>It'll all come from knowing that
your actions will tell</i>

<i> that your intentions
are noble, good and pure...</i>

<i>so gather courage from your comrades,</i>

<i>take the promise of your pals that whatever comes we'll take it and destroy.</i>

<i>So be true to the feelings
that you're fighting,</i>

<i>Because there's no fear
when you're on the right side.</i>

<i>The right side.</i>

<i>Where there's confidence
and wondrous piece of mind,</i>

<i>You can always persevere
whatever obstacles appear.</i>

<i>Because there's no fear
when you're on the right...</i>

<i>You're not always looking
over your shoulder,</i>

<i>you're not sneaking from
shadow to shadow,</i>

<i>You can live your life
free or in border</i>

<i>When you know you're
on the right side.</i>

<i>Where there's confidence
and wondrous piece of mind,</i>

<i>You can always persevere
whatever obstacles appear.</i>

<i>Because there's no fear
when you're on the right side.</i>

She... she's got the notes.
Except for a little section he tore off.

So she doesn't have what she really
wants which is the power to destroy.

So she kidnapped her with a fireball, so he would give here the missing section.

So he's probably on his way to
meet her right now.

And if she gets
the power to destroy,

Oh boy, it's gonna be trouble
for you, me, he and she.

It felt good. Alright, what do
we do, men?

Yeah...

We've got to find Derek before he
gives away that missing section.

-Speed, you take the  water way!
-I'm on my way.

And remember, men, no fear!

I just betrayed the most powerful,

most dangerous person
in the universe.

This is not good!
Not good!

Right on time!

Just to make sure
there are no tricks!

Zelda?

Odette!

Oh, Derek.

-You escaped ?
-Yes.

But you have to stop her.
She'll destroy everything.

She can't destroy anything
without this.

You keep falling for that old trick,
don't you, big guy?

Give me Odette!

Sorry, I need her
for the experiment.

To see if the power
to destroy really works.

Prince Derek...

Follow that fireball, Puffin!
Go!

That won't be necessary, sire.
Whizzer knows the way.

Nothing like a quiet
evening sitting by the fire.

You just can't keep
a good woman down.

Of course, she sort of puts
a damp on the things.

Odette. How did...

There's no time to explain, Derek.
You have to stop her.

I've got to get you out of
here first.

No, Derek.

Is there any escape?

Derek...

I won't see you die.
Is there any escape?

I think so...

This is crazy.

Trust me, Derek.
Pull!

Are you pushing or am I doing
all the work?

You're lucky, Odette.

You'll be the first to see
the power to destroy.

-Go, Odette !
-I'm not leaving you.

You!

-I was here first.
-So what? I am a prince.

Cowards! Come out!

This is war, not hide and seek.

Seek... My seekers!

What do you know? I have
improved on the forbidden arts.

You gotta get out of here, Odette.

You can't hide from this one.
Trust me! Go!

What?

It's a destroying seeker.
Go!

Seek out the swan
and destroy her!

No! Odette !

The fireball will die,
if you break the rod.

Odette.

Bye, Derek.

Hello, Zelda.

Rothbart, you're alive!

Amazing, isn't it?

Thank you for recovering the
forbidden arts.

But now you're through.

Tell you what, I'll give you
a chance. To run!

Traitor!

Zelda.

Puffin!

Odette?

Where is she?
Where is Odette?

Oh, Derek, she's gone.

Gone? What do
you mean gone?

The fireball.
She couldn't get away.

No!

Odette...

If you can hear me, Odette...
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...

I pray something good can still
come from destroying these notes.

Odette.

Is it really you?

-Oh, Derek.
-Oh, Odette. I'm so sorry. I love you.

-Sorry, Speed.
-Me too.

-I love you, Puffin.
-I love you.

These are the last two contestants
for the obstacle course.

They call this an obstacle course.
It doesn't even have a snake pit.

Last year's champion
Rock Chutney.

And a new entry this year -
Jean-Bob!

Let me apologize ahead
for defeating you.

I was looking forward to this,
but the little guy's still dumb.

I sort of feel sorry for him.

Yes, me too. I wish we
can spare him the shame.

Runners, to your mark.

Rock, my friend, you are a half wit.

In fact, it hurts me to know that
you are so very stupid.

-It's not me.
-Set!

In addition to all this...
you run like a girl.

-Go!
-I'll get you!

A new record! Jean-Bob
is prince for a day.

Now you see.
I am a prince!

Rogers!

Not again!
Rogers, get down here!

They really liked me!

Promise me, Derek, there's no
more magic in the castle.

I can't do that.

So long as you are here, Odette,
there'll always be magic.
