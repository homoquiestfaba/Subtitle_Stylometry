How much would this be worth?

I don't run a pawn shop here

Fine, I'll go to one

Hurry

Fifty dollars, I'll gamble again

Hey, watch it

It's you. Where are you going?

What's the rush?

Where're you going?

I've been very unlucky

I'm going to gamble again

Just can't believe I won't win

Believe it

Your forehead is dark, a sign of bad luck

Take a break

I don't believe I'm that unlucky

I've got fifty dollars

You want to bet?

Alright

What should we bet on here?

I've got an idea

I'm listening

It's easy

Just answer 'yes' to whatever I ask

You must be quick though

You'll lose if you say 'no'

That's it?

Yes

Fine, let's have a trial

Listen up

Has your wife gone off with another man?

What kind of question is that?

Yes or no?

Yes

Take it, can't believe you

For money's sake

Another 10 dollars

10 dollars

Are those men your fathers?

I've got so many fathers?

Yes or no?

Yes

Good boy

Buy a milk bottle with it

I'm telling you

If all my fathers are as nice as you...

I'll be rich; another ten

No, I've lost twenty dollars

Wait. One more time

Fine, but the stakes will be higher

Fine

Seventy dollars

Seventy dollars

Clean your ear wax

Is all this money mine?

No, I've got some too

You lose, you said 'no'

I'm so stupid. Should have said 'yes'

Come on

Place your bets

One, two, five, total eight, small

All small win

How come you win every time?

Of course.
I've offered my respects to the Gods

Is it working?

I get what I ask for

Just follow my lead

Excuse me

So many notes

Can I borrow a hundred?

No way, you still haven't paid your debts

Get lost, I'm trying to gamble here

Place your bets

Mister, please place my 200
on the upper gate

Upper gate

Two hundred on upper gate

Fine

Two hundred dollars? Are you sure?

Yes

I'll take my chances

You'll lose

Come on

Hold on

Place your bets

Ten again

Look

So?

You'll see

Oh, shit

Seven

I must be unlucky

Banker opens

Three, four, all win

You've it

So do you

You're unlucky

What have you got?

Nine, win

I knew I would win

Here you go

Hey, I placed two hundred dollars,
how come?

I'm doing this according to
the money on the table

You placed one hundred,
I'll give you another 100

I told him to place two hundred

Crazy

What's wrong with you?

I gave you two hundred

Two hundred? One hundred only

Give me back the money

You crook

You took my money
& wish to pocket it, huh?

Give me back my money

Give me the money back

What's going on?

The woman says
he has siphoned off her 100 quid

I told him to place two hundred

Fine, shut up

Give her two hundred, and send her away

Why would I take your money?

You, come over

Come here

Brother Nine, give me a chance

Kid, you've got some nerve

Look at all these IOU notes

What do you want here?

You want me to break your ribs?

Or have your legs amputed?

Tell me

I've been very unlucky

I've pawned everything

...except my wife

I've seen her before.
Quite a figure she's got

That's what everyone says

Get your wife to sleep with me
tomorrow night

Then I'll let you off

No way

I'd say no even if she agrees

Beat him up

Brother Nine, you should know

Women always ask for a show

I've got to give her some incentive

Lend me two hundred
to get her some trinkets

Don't try anything funny

Relax, I'll make sure she sleeps with you

Thanks, Brother

Two hundred dollars, that's a good deal

Cheers

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to my wife

Happy birthday to you

This beer is the best, dear

Drink some more

I thought the only thing
you remember is gambling

You still remember my birthday?

I've come to my senses

You, my wife, are most dear to me

Let's have another drink

No

It's your birthday

You must drink some more

Good

Stop it

Darling

We are in public

Let's not go home tonight

Where are we going then?

To a love motel

How much?

Interesting? So pretty

So many mirrors

Come here

So?

Don't worry, it's all set

Come over when I turn off the light

So pretty

Strip

Let me help you

Wait a minute

It's fun

Come here, darling

I want to take a bath first

Come on

You look gorgeous, darling

OK

Wow! You're amazing

Smells weird

Damn you

Get in

Sit down

Damn it

Turn your head

Let me teach you a lesson

You piece of shit

I've met a hot babe lately

And look what happened

I can't do anything now

Brother Nine, it could have worked out

You should have told me
about your body odor

Then I could have done...

No excuses

You've got two choices

First, you kill yourself

Second, let my staff to kill you

However that'd be a terrible death

So?

Is there a third option?

Yes, cut it off

Brother Nine, if you cut it

Then I'll become an eunuch

I'd rather kill myself

Fine, within 24 hours...

I want to read about your suicide
in the headlines

Or you'll be torn into pieces
within 48 hours

Think it over

Where are you going, honey?

You heartless fellow

You set up a trap for me
to sleep with some guy

I will divorce you

Honey, I had no choice

ltjust happened

Please forgive me

Cry all you want

Even if you cry yourself to death

I won't fall for your tricks

Crocodile tears

Leave me your number

Then I can call you sometime

...for tea

Call 999 or 110, you shit

999 or 110?

Easy to remember

Wait, honey

Kramer vs. Kramer

Me against the Jaws this time

Good bye Mahjong, pai gow, solitaire

Bye, honey

When unluckly even a tree
tends to bully you

Discard it

I'll pick another tree

My friend...

Be careful...

Please, don't do it

Don't try to save me

Sit down

I must die

I'll pick another tree

I must die

Thank God

You thought I care about you?

I just want to save the tree

This is government property

If you break it, then I'll be in trouble

Did you break this?

Yes or no?

Let's go to the police station

I've already charged you...

for destroying trees in the park

Do you have money for bail?

No, I'm broke

How about this?

Call your relatives to bail you out

I've got none. Even my wife has left me

I'll trust you for now

You can bail yourself out;
report to court on time

Sign here

Go

This is the most powerful type
of rat poison

Careful, one could die

Really?

How much?

Three dollars

Hey, what about my ecstasy pills?
I've paid you

Lower your voice

I sell these items secretly

Quiet

Hurry

Pay up

Ah Mei, where are you going?

For dinner

Your boyfriend's nice

Yes

I think so too

Let's call him

Go on then

Alright

For you

Go

Let's go

It's me

Pay up

Fine, talk to you later

Here you go

So many coins!

This is the wrong one

What's wrong with you?

Yes

Let's return it

What's this?

He must have taken the wrong packet

Such a drag, we're in a rush

Fine, take this

Goodbye, Hong Kong

My eyes to donate to
the Japanese blind man

My kidney for a friend who needs it badly

My blood for the vampire

So stupid

My teeth for a toothless guy

Signed, Cai Tou

You...

A flasher... nuts

Salute

Left, right, left, right

What are you doing?

Maybe I should cut it off

Cut it into pieces

Cut up your clothes

You want to flash again?

Left, right, left, right

Attention

Turn to the left

Right turn

Turn to the back

Stand still

Get set, ready

Don't run, stop

I'll shoot

Go... go... go

Thanks

Thanks everyone

Thanks

Stand still

Let me borrow this

Try again

Let me borrow this

Crazy

Got you

Sir

Sir, this guy is a streaker

You again? What's your problem?

Sir, look at my thigh

Am I Miss Hong Kong material?

Put it down

Do you have any idea

...what day is it today?

Your god mother's birthday?

My god father's birthday?

Wedding anniversary of them both?

No

Today is my unlucky day

You've been here twice,
what's the matter with you?

Nothing, sir

Sir, why isn't he...

wearing any pants?

PC1331

Yes, sir?

Get a piece a cloth for him

Yes, sir

Thanks

Listen, now I must charge you...

for indecent behavior in public

You have no money

And you said you have no relatives

Put him in the cell for a night

Go to court in the morning

Go

Sir

What?

Just speak up

I have no relatives

But I have a friend

I'll call him to bail me

Go on then, don't try anything funny

Brother Nine, you are so mean

If you want to collect my debt

See me in hell

Here I go

Damn it, I stepped out
for less than a minute

And someone broke my wind shield

LPG Gas can? Asshole

I will kill you if I see you

What now? I'm still alive?

Must be the robbers who dropped it

Hey, whaddya know!

Reckon it ain't my time to die yet

I struck gold

Spiritual tablet of my beloved daughter
Liu Ah Cui

Born on 7th Feb., 1958

Died on 2nd May, 1980

She's only 20 something

I thought it's made of gold

Such an unlucky thing

Who are you looking for?

You

Me? Do I know you?

I know you

Did you pick up...

a bag in the alley earlier?

No

What about this picture? Is this you?

Come in

So what?

What are you going to do?

I picked it on the street

Don't worry

I'm not here to collect the jewelry

And I've got more to offer

There's no free lunch in this world

That's for sure

Listen, my name is Liu San

This belongs to my daughter, Ah Cui

She was captured by the gangs
while entering...

Hong Kong illegally;
got tied up, raped and killed

Her body was dumped in the wild

I've watched that in the news

Listen well

She's my only daughter

After she's dead

I don't want her to be alone

Don't want her to be a wandering ghost

I must help her to find a husband

So that she won't be lonely

And what's that got to do with me?

Go advertise in the classifieds

It concerns you now that
you've picked up the bag

If you promise to marry her

I'll give everything to you

You haven't got a lot in here

I deserve more
for marrying a piece of wood

If you marry my daughter

...I'll be very generous

I'll give you a flat

which is already worth a few hundred grand

Below the peak,
across the Governor's house

Right of Queen Mary Hospital;
left of funeral home

Left, right, above, below

Where exactly is it?

Next to Kowloon Funeral parlor,
No. 2 Maple street

Has good vibes.
All in the neighborhood became rich

999 sq. Feet including the parking space

Let me think about it

999 sq. Feet including the parking space

That will be around a million

Old man, don't trick me

If you agree, we can go to a lawyer now

Deal

Master, your son-in-law

Please

The groom & bride, bow to heaven and earth

First bow, second bow

Please take a seat, bride's father

Please drink this, from the groom

Dad, please have some tea

Please

Have some tea, dear

Groom, please serve the tea
to your mother-in-law

Mom, please have some tea

Please

This is from my wife

Thanks

This is from me

Thanks, master

Groom, go have a drink
with the bridesmaids

Ladies

I'm here to raise a toast to you

Ladies, we don't have a big feast

I'm not a good host

Please help yourselves

Groom, bride,
please go to the bridal chamber

Good night

Good night

Thanks

Good night, master

From this day on

You are Ah Cui's husband now

In order for you to get along well

I must tell you about her habits

She's hot-tempered, knows Judo

You must treat her well

She likes to eat instant noodles
with fried eggs

You must cook for her every day

She likes a San Miguel before dinner

And a Guinness stout afterwards

That's good for health

She's lazy

She reads in bed and often leaves

...the light on at night

Electricity is expensive

Here's a switch

Clap once and the lights will turn off

Clap twice and it's on

Interesting. Where did you get it?

Lane Crawford

Well then, I won't bother you two

I'll drop by to see you sometime

Good night

You must be nuts

Made me marry a ghost!

Made me toast with a ghost. This is crazy

I am only in this for the money

Sick of your sight

Stay in here

Better turn in soon

Is this place haunted?

So it's you

You stupid dog

Didn't expect a dog here

Fine, since you're here before me...

You can live here

You just scared me a while back

Silly me. There are no ghosts on earth

Scared myself

Romeo and Juliet,
a pair of star crossed lovers

Hey, what's that terrible singing?

They won't be separated...

Won't be separated

Fine, stop it

You sound terrible

Sorry?

I told you to stop

What? This is Hong Kong

I can do whatever I like

Sing whatever I like

Listen

I come from the hills, carrying an orchid

I can dance too, look

A ball on the left, a ball on the right

I'm playing ping pong

Damn it

I'll show you

Go on, sing

You threw a tennis ball at me

See if you'll keep singing

Shake! From head to toes

Shake! Johnson's Baby Powder

Shake, shake, shake

Use Johnson's Baby Powder

Shake

You will feel like a baby
all through the day

It's great

Shake

Hey, Doggie?

What? I'm busy tonight

I've a date

I'm going to the disco with Ah Zhu

Hello

Miss Air Hostess

You must be busy
flying all around the places

Mister

You still haven't paid
the cleaning charges

Fine... 30 dollars, is it?

Thank you

Who is it?

It's me, Cai Tou

Hello, darling

Oh, Ah Zhu, look at you

You are sexy

...and hot

Let's go out for dancing, huh?

My daddy might lecture me

We'll play at home

Tell me whether you love me or not

Don't lie to me

I'm happy besides you

You have great legs

Let's go to the disco

Ah Zhu, let's go

Let's go

Why did you hit me?

Why?

You! We were married yesterday

And you're cheating on me

Listen, I'm here for you

That means you are looking for me

I...

She is she, I'm me

She's a slut, I'm Joan of Arc

We're not the same

What happened to your voice, who are you?

Your wife

Get back home now

Beat you up

Ah Zhu, it's me, Cai Tou

Get out, go home

Damn it

I don't believe this

It's only instant noodles...

not Shark's fin soup; big deal

Romeo and Juliet

Star Crossed lovers

Wishing to be in love forever

Stop it

Never will be apart

We...

I'm prepared

I've got a racket to block you

What do you say now?

I...

Are you serious, Cai Tou?

The ghost is so powerful?

I'm not kidding

It's scary

If that ghost...

really died a terrible death

like on the news

I'm sure she will haunt you forever

So unlucky

I'd have divorced her

...but I'm in it for the money

Don't worry

I'll think of something

It's simple

What?

Give me a thousand

I'll find you a psychic

And she can talk to the ghost

Are you kidding?

She can talk to the ghost?

I'm serious

Just pay up

Fine

Only one?

How much do you need?

An extra one, at least

The gods, the guards of hell

Liu Ah Cui, the illegal immigrant

who died earlier

Her husband Cai Tou

would like to have a chat with her

Come up here now

What's she doing?

Shut up

What's happening?

She's got possessed

Possessed?

Give me back my life

Where are you from, woman ghost?

I was an illegal immigrant

Why can't you rest in peace?

I've had a tough life

While I was trying to sneak
over the border

I got captured by a gang

They robbed my money

Raped me and then killed me

Barbwired my hands
and put my body in a carton

I died terribly

Why did you try to sneak over the border?

I wanted to look for Teresa Tang

Is she crazy?

For a pop singer?

Teresa Tang has lots of fans

You've come to the wrong place

Teresa Tang is not in Hong Kong

Go look for her elsewhere

Please leave my client alone

No, I can't

I must get my
Hong Kong identity card first

The decree of special pardon
doesn't apply now

You can't get the HKID card

Where can I go then?

No. 1 Pine Street

Give her some money and it might work

Go ask her

Ask her if she'll leave if we pay...

My friend, he said...

Would you leave if I pay you?

Yes

Open a bank account for me

Fixed savings or current account?

Even ghost asks for money

Exactly

I'll kill you if you won't pay

Let go of me...

You stepped on my toes

Who switched on the light? It's over

What now?

Turn it off...

You lied?

Asshole, you lied to me

Give me back my money

It's only a thousand

Think of it as helping a friend

Who's your friend? Pay up

I've spent it already

I've hired a crew, go

Listen

Don't trust anyone, idiot

Damn it

I don't want to see you again

My friend...

I ain't called
the Great Spiritual Master for nothing

Sit down

I'm the Great Spiritual Master

If there's something wrong...

Also...

Family problems

Possessed by ghosts, come to me

How do you know that?

Have a seat, my friend

You don't look so good

You're being haunted

A series of love problems

If I don't help...

You'll die tonight

Don't bluff

My friend

You didn't heed good advice.
Your time is up

What a shame!

I'll really die?

Yes, for sure

You can help?

Certainly

Are you for real?

I got duped yesterday

Don't worry, you can pay after the job

I won't take your money if it doesn't work

Don't bluff

I'll show you

Fine

The incense goes to the underworld

Here I'm calling the great exorcists

The Four Heavenly Kings

Assist me to expel the ghost

I'm here to capture the spirit

Only the spirit

The spirit of Ah Cui

Bless this rice

Bless this rice

I'm here to capture the spirit

Heavenly gods

This is urgent

One, two, three, four

Five, six, seven, eight

Liu Ah Cui, I must capture you

Ding, ding, ding

Ding, ding, ding

I must capture Liu Ah Cui

You can turn on the lights now

I've caught the ghost

Miss Liu, please forgive my rudeness

Mister, the ghost you told me to catch

...isn't a wandering ghost

She's the master of the house here

I can't catch her

She's kicking me out

Sorry, I'm off now

Master

You rotten man

Piece of shit

Lowlife

What?

You found an exorcist?

You think it's that simple?

You are possessed

Shut up

Sit down

You know who I am?

I'm your wife

Trying to dump me so soon?

You wish

Even if you're a ghost...

you should be reasonable

Reasonable?

We got married

You take me...

for a promiscuous woman?

Do you know what you're doing?

I married you

Good that you know

You eat and spend my money

You heartless man

You found an exorcist?

Dear, do you know that...

I've got to tend to my physical needs

You're like smoke

You have nothing for me

I sleep with the pillow every night

You want me to be a monk?

Not exactly

What then?

Don't you worry

You'll get lucky tonight

It's 1 a. M

Is she coming or not?

The exorcist lied

Time to sleep

Miss Air Hostess

You're back?

I'm here to serve you

My dear husband

You got possessed

Good, you're welcome here every night

Open

Open

Open

Come scrub my back, dear

Let me do it

The world of a real man full of vigour

Macho

Ladies and gentlemen

The plane has entered the eye
of the typhoon

We'll experience some turbulence

Please fasten your seat belts, thanks

Serious turbulence

There he goes again

Freeze

Don't worry, I'll take care of it

You've been my companion for so many years

Who would thought that you'd leave me

Now I'm all alone

Poor thing

The beautiful Shangri-La

Lovely Shangri-La

I'm deeply in love

Deeply in love

The beautiful Shangri-La

Lovely Shangri-La

I'm deeply in love

The women of Alishan are pretty

The men of Alishan are strong

Ah... ah...

The women of Alishan are pretty

The men of Alishan are strong

The women of Alishan are pretty

Let's see what
Freddy's weather forecast is

Sorry

Sorry? Should have said something

I'm all soaked

Miss Air Hostess

Oh, it's you

No garbage today

Bye

Don't you recognize me?

We've just met

I'm your wife

What? She's on you? You...

Get in

Let's begin

Please leave me alone, dear

Please leave me alone...

We haven't started yet

No, I want you now

Help...

Stop it, dear

Lie down...

No...

I want you

Dear

Please leave me alone this time

Strip

Let me help you

No, dear

Don't go

What are you doing?

Strip, hurry

Let go of me...

Stop it

I'll knock you out

Stop it

I'll knock you out

Don't worry

Let me show you some colors

It's all over

It's spring time

The flowers are blossoming

Careful, the paint is still wet

I know

The daffodils are blooming

So are the peonies

Here again

You've been walking in and out
of the toilet

Is your kidney alright?

So what if it isn't?

None of your business

I'm concerned

I'm more concerned about you

Are you a squint since birth?

Peeped at my sister in the shower
when I was little

That's what happened

Lucky you didn't go blind!

Quit the chit-chat

Get back to work

Why are you blocking the way?

Don't worry

If you think my eyes aren't working

...you're wrong

Look at the yellow...

the red and the black

The stains have ruined the wall

With my eyes

...and one brush

The yellow's gone

The red's gone, and the black's gone

All gone

Now the wall's clean

That's the power I wield

You know?

Fine, get back to work

I'm done talking to you

Don't look down on me

Let me get dolled up a bit

The nails, too

Who is it?

Me

What now?

I'm hot, open up

Who's hot?

I want you

Oh no, she's on him

Not again

What now?

I can't take this anymore

Hurry, I can't wait

I'm doing a number one

I'm in a hurry

Come on

It's over

Hurry

I want you

Here you go

I don't want this, I want yours

Help

Give it to me

Help

Don't you run away

Wait, I want you

Let me kiss you

Kiss me, dear

I want you, come back

Stinks

Are you sick of me now?

You're a man

I'm your wife, what are you talking about?

No, you got possessed, that's all

I'm not, I'm your wife

No, you're not

I'm serious

I'm your legal wife

Legal? Wait

What do you want?

I want to take a leak

Hey, don't try to sneak away

Come here

Don't come down here

Don't come down here

No, I can't catch you

It's dangerous

It will break

It will break

Don't worry. It won't

Sorry

It's over

If you want to visit tonight, dear

...you better possess the air hostess

Not the garbage woman, or the painter

Then it will be a bitch next

I won't be able to take it

Please be considerate

...or I'll die

Click the chopsticks twice if you agree

Yes?

Great, you're so cute

Here she comes

It's open

I'm going to have a good time tonight

Let me fix the room first

The hen marries to the pig

He's no good

If you've eaten something bad

...you'll go to the toilet

Toilet paper

Brother Nine, it's you

You sure have guts.
I told you to kill yourself

And you're living a good life here

I'm now an eunuch because of you

How can you make it up to me?

I'll fix it for you

Fix it? I won't be here if I can fix it

I'll pay you then

That's easy for you to say

Tell him what he owes me

Asshole

He owes $2,400,000

You heard him

I owe you a thousand

How come? $2,400,000?

What currency is that? Japanese Yen?

I still haven't charged you
for my operation fees

You think I'm the Hong Kong Bank?

Brother

Please don't

It's not funny, don't

That will kill me

I want you to be like me

Not a complete man
for the rest of your life

Help

Don't move

Help

Take it out

Sure
