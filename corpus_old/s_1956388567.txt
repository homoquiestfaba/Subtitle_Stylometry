Tell me what happened, David.

In detail.

These photos don't have
enough detail on 'em?

I wanna hear it from you,
in your words, from the beginning.

I just finished my shift...
at the hospital.

I was going home.

Woa!
David, quit that up.

I am! It's comming with me
and I'm on my way out.

They'll kill you, you know.

Let me exoverrated.

After that, nothing.

What do you do at the hospital?

I'm a glorified janitor.

I clean up after sick people.

Do you have any enemies there?

Spies have enemies, I'm an ordaly.

So you have no clue why
anyone wanna do this to you?

No.

I'm nothing here.
Bleding into the walls.

I don't know why, - whoever
did this to me - picked me.

But they did.

What do you remember next?

Waking up.

Hello, David.

You don't know me, but I know you.

I want to play a game.

I'll give you a demonstration of
what happens if you loose.

The device you are wearing is hooked
into your upper and lower jaws.

When the timer at the back goes off
your mouth will be ripped permanently open.

Think of it like a reverse bear trap.

I'll show you.

There is only one key to open the device.

It is in the stomach of your dead cellmate.

Look around, David.
Know that I'm not lying.

Live or die.

Make...your...choice.

It says here, in the report...

...that after the timer started,
that's when you saw the body.

Paralysis, he wasn't dead he just couldn't move.

You cut open someone who was still breathing.
I know!

What happened after you've found the key?

Congratulation, David.

You are still alive.

Most people are so ungreatful to be alive.

But not you... not anymore.

Are you greatful, David?
