after Halley's Comet.</i>

<i>And I've always been fascinated
by my interstellar namesake.</i>

<i>It burns its way across the solar
system visiting Earth every 76 years.</i>

<i>Steady and true, like clockwork
over a billion years.</i>

<i>Now, I'm no scientist, but I know
that comet is a freak of nature.</i>

<i>I sometimes wonder
if life is like my comet,</i>

<i>unbending and predestined
in following one course</i>

<i>no matter what I might do,
or is life flexible?</i>

<i>Can we alter it? Change it?</i>


<i>I don't know the answer,
but one thing was for sure,</i>

<i>my life was about to be thrown
off its course.</i>

But what are the charges?

Transporting stolen goods
across state lines?

You were just helping Bill out.


Well, they used you, Dean.

I told you to stay away
from those guys.

Well, where are they
keeping you?

Dean, that is 40 miles away.

I can't just drop everything.
I have a shift tonight.

I love you too, but sometimes
you make it really difficult.

Okay.


Can we go and see him?

I have shifts all weekend.

Maybe Monday.

Monday?
He needs us now.

Look, he's gonna be fine.

Okay, I'm sorry I know this is really
hard on you girls but he is fine.

I have to go to work.

I love you.

[keys jingle]

Take care of each other.

[somber music playing]

What are you doing?

I can't wait till Monday
to see dad.

Hailey, we...
we don't have a car.

Who says we need a car?

Hailey?


[horse neighs]

A wagon?

Horse and wagon.

You're kidding, right?

Look, we'll take the backroads
which I know very well.

We'll be there in a day, tops.

I don't know, Hailey.
Okay, look.

Come or don't come,
I'm going to see dad.

[upbeat music playing]

<i>â™ª Oh, give me land, lots of land
Under starry skies above â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't fence me in â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let me ride through
The wide-open country â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That I love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't fence me in â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let me be by myself
In the evening breeze â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Listen to the murmur
Of the cottonwood trees â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Send me off forever
But I ask you please â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't fence me in â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just turn me loose
Let me straddle my old saddle â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Underneath the western skies â™ª</i>


First class.

I told you would be.


She's already mad.

<i>â™ª I want to ride to the ridge
Where the west commences â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And gaze at the Moon
'Till I lose my senses â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can't look at hovels
And I can't stand fences â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't fence me in â™ª</i>

Where are we?

I'm not sure.

We may have missed the turn off.
Missed the turn off?

How could you get us lost?
We are not lost.

We are lost. You took the back
roads and now we're lost.

We better just stay
here tonight.

Sleep out here?
Well, we can't keep going.

It's gonna get dark soon
and that's too dangerous.

<i>â™ª Don't fence me in â™ª</i>

I can't believe you got us lost.

Okay, we are not lost.

I know exactly where we are.

Where?

Somewhere on planet Earth.

I can't believe you.
You are so stupid.

Come on, Brooke.

Remember, you just gotta...

<i>â™ª Keep on a sunny side â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Always on a sunny side â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Keep on a sunny side of life â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It will help us every day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It will brighten all the way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If we keep on a sunny side
Of life â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's a dark
And a troubled side of life â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's a bright

[both laugh]

[horse neighs]
[crickets chirping]

I still don't have a signal.

Would you look at the stars?

You're obsessed with your phone.

I am not.

I miss grandpa.

We all do.

I didn't even want to go
to practice that day.

When we were driving I almost
asked him to turn around.

If only I had,
he'd still be here.

Grandpa wouldn't want you to
beat yourself up, now would he?

No.

So shut up and go sleep.

I love you.

I love you, too.

[suspenseful music playing]

[horse neighs]
[man 1] Don't move.

I won't.

Quiet.

[man 1] Snake! Watch out!
[both girls screaming]

Howdy. You guys okay?

Yeah. Uh, thank you.
I hate snakes.

What are you girls
doing out here?

We can ask you
the same question.

Uh, I spotted the smoke
from your fire.

I just... I wanted
to come check it out.

You can't be too casual
about a fire out here.

We're on our way to see our
daddy at the Grady County Jail.

What's he in there for?

Some crime he didn't commit.

I know someone at the jail.

I can take you there
if you like.

How do we know we can trust you?


You seem pretty lost and, uh,
I might be your best bet.

Always good to know someone
on the inside.

All right.
Great.

Hey, pack up your stuff.

Let's get our stuff.

[joyful music playing]

[all chuckle]

Hey, Son. Come on in.

Hi, Dad.
[police officer] Hey. [chuckles]

Uh, who's this?

Dad, this is Brooke and Hailey.

Hi.
[Marcos] Their father's here in jail.

Oh, son. Now, I told you...
[Hailey] Sir...

we just want to see our daddy.

That's all.

Well, next time y'all need to go
through the official channels.

Uh, yes, Sir.

What's your father's name?
Uh, Dean Mays.


Uh, I'm not too familiar
with his case,

but from what I can see,
bail has been set at $50,000.

That's a lot of money, Sir.

Yes, it is.

[melancholy music playing]

Well, let's get you in
for that visit.

Step in to my right.

Daddy!

Hi. I miss you.
I'm so happy to see you.

Yeah, how are you?

I'm okay.
I'm good. I'm good. I'm fine.

Okay.
Well, what happened?

Uh, I was friends with
some really bad people

and, um,
they took advantage of me.

But I want you to know,
I'm not guilty of anything

that they've said I've done.

We believe you, daddy.
Yeah.

Thank you.

What... what are y'all doing
here? How did you get here?

Oh, it's a...
It's kind of a long story,

but we just couldn't stay away.

We wanted to let you know
how much we support you.

I love you two so much.
You, we too.

Thank you.
It means the world to me.

I'm sure we'll find a way
to get him out soon.

We will.

It was nice to see him.

It was.
[both laugh]

All right.
Where y'all headed?

Oh, um, our grandmother lives
about five miles from here.

So we're gonna go visit her and see if
she knows anything about our daddy's case.

Well, you have my number
if you need anything.

I do, and as soon as my phone's
charged, I'll text you.

Thank you, for all your help.
We really appreciate it.

Yeah.
It wasn't any trouble at all.

[mellow music playing]

Where have you two been?

Your mama's been worried sick.

[both] Hi, grandma.
[Brooke chuckles]

Some rig you got here.

It was Hailey's idea.
Yeah.

We texted mom before
our phones died.

Texted her?
You should have called her.

the death of communication.

We just came from seeing daddy.

$50,000 to get him out of jail.

I know.

Do you have that much money,
grandma?

Well, darlin', I don't
but we'll figure something out.

[car engine revving]

Here comes your mama.

I don't imagine she's going
to be too happy with you two.

[Hailey] Three, oh!
[Erin] Oh!

Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mom.

You cannot just ride cross-country
whenever you feel like it.

Look, we're sorry,
but we got to see dad.

Hey, Candace!

Hm.
Erin. Can you believe your son?

Last time I heard you're
innocent until proven guilty.

I don't have the money to bail him out

and you haven't worked in years.

I'm literally going to have
to pick up extra shifts

just to make ends meet
while Dean's incarcerated.

Well, I could help you out.

Why don't you just leave
the girls with me?

I'll look after 'em and its
summer, so there's no school?

Can we, Mom?
We can text you every day.

I should be punishing you,
not rewarding you.

Does that mean, yes?

Fine.

But you better behave
yourselves.

Erin, if they get into any trouble
you better call me immediately.

Oh, well, I'm sure they're gonna
be perfect little angels.

[chuckling]
[Candace] Get over here.

I'm worried sick about you.

Don't ever do that again.

All right.

[mellow music playing]

Why do we have to go here?

I volunteer here
a few days a week.

Volunteer? Didn't you used
to be a country music star?

Yep, and now,
I'm a star volunteer.


[Hailey laughs]
Come on.

We're gonna be right with you.

Oh, it's so nice to see you.
Thank you.

Hey, everybody.
Hi.

Good morning, Erin.
Hello, Miss Mays.

My daughters are one
of your biggest fans.

Can I get a selfie?
Oh, why, sure.

Thank you so much. [laughing]
Okay.

Let's go.

Perfect. Thank you.
You're welcome.

Hello.

It's so good to see
you, Miss Mays.

We really appreciate you
helping us out today.

Oh, it's my pleasure.

What are we serving today?
Well, hot chicken tenders, yeah. Yep.

Ooh!
Homemade mashed potatoes.

Here you go.
Good old green beans.

Looks good.
[Daniel laughs]

And it looks like
we're in business.

How are you today?
[woman 1] Good.

There you go.

How's your son? Is he good?

Is he doing well? Good.

And you young, man,
would you like some chicken?

[boy 1] Yes, please.
All right. All right.

How'd that volleyball team do?
[boy 2] They won.

I knew you would.

[clears throat]

Hey, beautiful.


Oh, my gosh!

Hailey, wait a minute.

Hailey, stop, please!

My name is Rufus Gibbs

and I'm a talent scout
for singer-songwriters.

No, you're a busboy.

Okay, I am but I'm also seriously
developing my career in music management.

I just heard you sing
and I think you have talent.

I've never heard that song.
Did you write it?

Yeah.

It's good.

So let me ask you this.

Are you interested in becoming
a successful singer-songwriter?

It's my passion.

Good.
Then I'd like to represent you.


I'm 19.

I look young for my age.

I don't think so.

I can get you gigs.
No, thanks.


[door closes]

[country music playing]

I like that store.
Yeah.

You should go in there soon.

Hailey!

Hailey!
[Hailey] Oh, no!

Who's that?

It's this guy
from Community Center.

He's weird.
Yeah.

Hey, it's Rufus, you remember?

Yeah, I do. [chuckles]
How are you?

I'm good and you should
be good, too.

I got you a gig.
You already got me a gig?

Yeah, I told you
I was connected.

Caps Brewery, tomorrow at six.

Okay, if I come, I'm bringing
my sister and a friend.

Sweet. I'll see you there.

All right.

A star is born.

Okay.
[engine starts]

[people chattering]

Thank you, guys, so much.

It's so good to see
you guys again.

Give me one second. Hailey!

It's so good to see you.

Yeah, that's...
that's unnecessary. All right.

This is my friend Marcos.

Hey.
Howdy.

And my sister, Brooke.
Hi.

Hey, Brooke.

All right. Well, you two
go find a seat in the audience

because me and Hailey need to go
over some business backstage.

Thank you so much. All right, come on, Hailey.
Okay.

All right.
This is the owner, Mr. Capp.

This is the singer I told
you about, Hailey Mays.

Well, I'm glad to have
you join us here, Hailey.

This guy's been talking me up
like nobody's business.

Really looking forward
to hearing you sing.

Yes, Sir.
Excuse me.

Oh, and this is Maddie Evans.

Howdy.
Hi, I'm Hailey.

Maddie's a gifted
singer-songwriter herself.

He's delusional.
[woman 2] Hey, Rufus. Can I talk to you for a sec?

I'll be right back.

Does he represent you?
He wishes.

[both laughing]

Singing and songwriting
are really just hobbies for me,

but if you ever get stuck and need
a catchy rhyme, you can call me.

I will.
[Rufus] Hailey! Hailey!

I'll see you later.
Okay. See ya.

So, listen, I was looking
at your social media, right?

And you have 250 followers.
That's... that's pathetic.

It's 258 actually.
It doesn't matter.

You still need one million,
two million to make it big.

Okay.

All right.
Let's step in here for a second.

You can take a seat...

but before we get started,
I do need you to sign this.

What is it?
An agreement.

It says I'll be
representing you.

Oh, I'd rather have my grandma
look at it first.

Well, it's mostly there
to protect you.

You know,
if you make a ton of money,

how much I get
and stuff like that.

How much do you get
if I make a ton of money?

It's the industry
standard 20 percent,

which is really not that much.

You can trust me, I'm sure
your grandma would agree.

So if you can initial the first page...
Okay.

...and sign the last one...

and initial there.

Congrats, you're on your way!

Thanks, I think.

Oh, you're on in five minutes, so tune
up your guitar, get your voice ready.

Are you excited? I'm excited.

Yeah, yeah.
Hailey Mays is in the building.

Yeah, she is.


Hey, folks. Okay.

Uh, now, we got a wonderful new
singer here named Hailey Mays.

And, uh, tonight, Hailey's gonna
sing an original composition.

So, uh,
let's give it up for her.

All right. Here we go.

[all cheering]

Yeah, Hailey!

Hey, everybody, I'm Hailey

and I will be singing an original
song called "A Cowgirl's Song".

So hope y'all enjoy.

<i>â™ª She saddles up
And drives across the plain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Into a sunset
Slowly fades away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Been seven days

<i>â™ª She's always moving on
From yesterday â™ª</i>

[woman 3] You got this, Hailey.

Try again.
Sorry. I can't... I can't.

Thank you.

[people chattering]



It's okay.
That happens to everyone.

No, no, it doesn't.

What was that?

Get outta here, Rufus!

Why didn't you tell me
that you have stage fright?

That is totally uncool, Hailey.

You're not helping at all.
Just wait outside.

I didn't sign up
for amateur hours.

You're a jerk.

Just ignore him.

Every singer gets butterflies.

I will never try
to perform again.

I can't.

I promise, you will.

[mellow music playing]

[crickets chirping]

How you doing?

Okay.

Did Brooke tell you
what happened?

She did.

Why do I want to be a singer like you when
I can't even sing in front of 20 people?

Oh, you could get
the hang of it.

It just takes practice
and experience.

Did you ever get stage fright?


When I was starting out,

I had this performance I was
doing and I was so nervous.

I... I couldn't make
the chords on my guitar.

They would not make chord.


But I just kept performing

and pretty soon,
I never even thought about it.

Do you miss performing?

[clicks tongue]
Not really.

When your grandpa died I...

I just didn't feel
like it anymore.

Must've been hard to give it up.

Oh, honey,
I had my time to shine.

Now I'm doing something else.

And it's okay with me.

I love you, grandma.

Who raced this barrel?
No one.

Well, I used to,
but I don't anymore.

Why not?

It's kinda obvious, isn't it?

Well, I don't know about that.

You'd be surprised
what people can do.

[car approaching]

Hey.

Hi.

What's he doing here?

He has something
he wants to say to you.

No.
Just listen to him, Hailey.

Absolutely not.

To err is human,
but to forgive is cool.


All right.

The way I acted last
night was wrong.

You were horrible.

Totally...

and I sincerely apologize.

I'd really like another chance.

How do I know you won't
do the same thing again?

I won't...

and I have some ideas that might
help you get over your stage fright.

Ideas?

[guitar music playing]

<i>â™ª Well, that's all right, mama
That's all right for you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That's all right, mama
Any way you do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But that's all right

Wow...

she is quite talented and
beautiful just like her grandma.

<i>â™ª That's all right, mama â™ª</i>

[Hailey laughs]

[all laughing]

Hey, ladies, we're having
a potato sack race later.

Taking bets on who will win.

Sounds like a lot of fun,
said no one, ever.

Okay, well, if you change
your mind,

sign-up sheets on the table
over there.

He will bet on anything.

Does he really make
money gambling?

I don't know, but he practically
lives at that horse betting place.

You want to bet on the sack race?
Really?

Yeah, race is a race,
might as well bet on it.

No, thanks.
I like to keep my money.

Suit yourself.

You know when I get an inside tip at the
racetrack, I win 90 percent of the time.

Really?

Like clockwork.
Big bucks to be made.

[country music playing]

Here we go.

On your mark.

Get set. Go!


Whoa! [laughs]

[woman 4] Whoa! Whoa!

Maddie!

Hey, Maddie!

She has lupus.
I've seen this before.

Lupus, what's Lupus?

Someone call 9-1-1.

Maddie, Maddie.
Maddie, honey, can you hear us?

[siren chirps]

I'm fine.

Y'all really shouldn't be making
such a fuss over me.

Well, you just passed out, Miss.

We've got to make
sure you're okay.

Well, it's happened before
so it's nothing new.

With autoimmune diseases,

there's all sorts of combinations
of factors that can set it off.

Stress, fatigue, diet.

Are you under any stress lately?

No, I just wanted to win
the stupid potato sack race.

Well,
all your vitals look normal,

but, uh, first thing Monday morning I
want you to go see your doctor, okay?

Okay.

I'm going to check in
and make sure you do.

I can always use a reminder.

I've got your number.

Good.
All right.

We'll hang out for ten minutes and
we'll get you outta here, okay?

Okay, thanks.
All right.

Thank you.

What?
You two had a moment.

A moment?

I don't know what
you're talking about.

[mouth words]

[upbeat music playing]
[audience cheering]

Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

Man, that was such a great ride.
I know, wow!

Hey, guys.

Uh, this is Amberley Snyder, barrel
racing champion and overall nice person.

Hey.
[Rufus] Hey.

Hey.
Hi.

What's your fastest time?
Here?

Sixteen-three.

Wow, that's fast.

Do you barrel race?
I used to but I got injured.

I know a little bit about that.

Tell me your name.
I'm Brooke.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

It's good to see you guys.

It's gonna be a great day.
[Marcos] Yes, Ma'am.

See y'all later.
Yeah, sounds good.

See you, Amberley.

<i>â™ª Step by step
She makes her way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She gets a little bit high
To numb the fear and the pain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She gotta make that money
Even when it kills â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Gonna raise this baby
And pay them bill â™ª</i>

All right, folks,
next up is Amberley Snyder.

<i>â™ª 'Cause she's a big city
Cowgirl â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Trying to make it
In this cruel â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Dark and scary world â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Doing everything she can
For her baby girl â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I know
She's gonna be all right â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She's a big city cowgirl â™ª</i>

Are you kidding me?

She's paralyzed
and she can barrel race?

Pretty cool, huh?
It's amazing.

Looking good, Amberley.

She's fast.

Yeah, she's something else,
isn't she?

How about it for Amberley Snyder?

Hey.
Hey.

You never called me back.

I didn't know you called me.

Left you a voicemail.
Called to check on you.

Are you sure about that?
Pretty sure.

You did call me.

Well, what...
what did your doctor say?

Same thing he always says that I
need to live a stress-free life.

Maybe you should listen to him.

Well, we got to go
but see you later.

See you.

[indistinct chatter]

...in a few weeks.

All right. You ready?
I guess so.

This is the moment we've been practicing
for, so don't mess it up and we'll be good.

That was definitely the worst
pep talk I've ever heard.

Yeah.
Sorry.

Yeah, I'll work on that.
All right.

Let's roll it out.
Really?

we have a special treat for you today.

An up-and-coming local talent,

please welcome to the arena
floor, Hailey Mays.

[audience applaud]


You really saved my button.

You would have done
the same for me.

Okay, well, that was a rough
start, but Maddie saved the day.

[man 2] So there you go.

You bet on my performance?

I bet on you, Hailey.
All right? He bet against you.

Hey, you guys.
Bob Chandler's heading this way.

I invited him.
[Hailey] Who's Bob Chandler?

Only the biggest record
producer in Oklahoma.

Ladies. Rufus.

[laughs]
Hey.

That was quite a performance.

Uh, thank you, Sir.
Thank you.

I'm Bob Chandler and I'd like
to get right to the point.

I'd like to work
with the two of you.

Start off by cutting a single.

And if everything works out,

then we can talk about a record
deal. How does that sound?

Yee-haw! That is awesome.

Thank you so much.

We can release it on my
boutique label, Bronco Busters

and I'll make sure that it has
every chance to find an audience.

What do you say?

Thank you so much, Bob.

I'd really love to work
with you and all,

but I'm gonna have to pass.

Well, why is that, dear?

Well, I'm just focusing on
other things in life these days.

But, Hailey's the one you want.

She's a solid solo act,

and I was just helping out
for fun today.

Well, you know
what's best for yourself.

Thank you for understanding.
[chuckling]

Well, what do you say we get together
next week, uh, Wednesday at 10 a.m.?

We'll be there. Thank you.

Ladies.
Thank you.

Thank you.

[all laughing]

<i>â™ª Fireflies dance in the sky â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wish you may
I wish you might â™ª</i>

Well, I'm so proud of you.

She's even got a big-time record
producer interested in her.

Oh, you don't say.

Remember all those times
just sitting around singing?

I knew you were
something special.

You're both so special.

You don't have to say that, Dad.

I mean it.
So proud of all my girls.

All of you.

You just hang in there because we're going to
do everything we can to get you out of here.

Thanks, Mom.

In the meantime,
don't worry about me.

I'm okay.

[mellow music playing]

What are we going to do?

I wish they'd pay us that
insurance money from the accident.

Well, what's the holdup?
It's been four years.

I know. Typical red tape.

Just need to shake things up.

Well, hello, Miss Mays, girls.

Mr. Daniels.
Hi.

It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

I suppose so.

Well, I know you're all busy.
Nice seeing you.

Actually,
it's lucky we ran into you.

We are having dinner at our house
tonight and we wanted to invite you.

Really?
Yes.

Well, that sounds lovely.

Shall we say seven o'clock?

Sounds perfect.

Lovely. See you then.

212 Lincoln Lane.

I look forward
to seeing you later.

Erin.

Yeah, see you later, I guess.

What in the world
are you thinking?

Grandma, you said
we need to shake things up.


All right.
Okay, what do you think?

Uh, maybe no scarf.

[doorbell dings]

Oh, he's early.

Go answer the door.

You look great, Grandma.

Thanks.
[Brooke chuckles]

Ah, young love.
[both laughing]

[clears throat]

Hello, Miss Mays.

Mr. Daniels. Please come in.

Thank you.

Nice.

We're right in here.
Nice.

It's right in here.
Oh!

Aren't you eating with us?

Uh, we changed our minds.
Hi, Mr. Daniels.

Hi.
[Brooke] Hi, Mr. Daniels.

Hello.

You know
how flighty teenagers are.

We're gonna go hang out
on our phones instead.

Yeah.

Uh... Oh, would you like
to sit over here?

May I help you?

Thank you.
Sure.

Yeah, yeah.

They're very sweet girls.

Someone went through a lot
of trouble.

They are sweet.

Ah. Ahem.
[crickets chirping]

Would you like some wine?
Oh, please. Yes.

[both laughing]
Allow me.

To... tomorrow.

I'll drink to that.

[rock music playing on mobile]


Hailey, Brooke, turn that off.
Oh, no, please.

Leave it on. I love that song.

You do?
Yes.

I've always loved your music.

You know when I was 20, I could sing
every song in your <i>Silver Ridge</i> album.

You were always the embodiment of...

I really shouldn't say you
were, you still are today.

Thank you.

You can leave that on.

[both laughing]

I haven't heard her laugh
like that in a long time.

Yeah, me neither.

Thank you.
Hey, Bill.

Hey.

Good morning.
Hey, there.

What will you have?

Hey, I really enjoyed
y'alls concert the other night.

That was crazy, wasn't it?

I was wondering. Uh...

I play guitar and I thought maybe we
could get together and jam sometime.

I don't jam and I don't date which
sounds like that's where this is heading.

Why not, if you don't
mind me asking?

Well, because of my condition.

No stress, remember?

And dating can be
very stressful.

Okay, well,
I just thought it'd be fun.

Take a look at that menu.
I'll be back in a minute.

[mellow music playing]

You wanted orange juice, right?

What you two girls did last
night was embarrassing

and awkward, and ill conceived.

And I'm gonna have
to give both of you...

a high-five.

[all laughing]

Oh, he is a nice man.

I have to say
I really enjoyed myself.

And I've been thinking.
I've decided

that I'm going to come out
of retirement, just temporarily,

and we're gonna raise money
for Dean's bail with a concert.

I mean that is the one
thing I can do.

Right?
I love that.

Yes.
[all laugh]

Look, I feel better already.
Yeah.

All right.

Well, let's talk about
what we're going to do.

Actually, Sir, we're real excited
about cutting a record with you...

but how would you feel about also
doing something with my grandma?

And just who is your grandma?

The amazing Erin Mays.

Erin Mays is your grandmother?

And she's coming out
of retirement?

[door opens]
Yeah. Here she is now.

Bob.

Good to see you.

So you already know each other?

Bob was my first manager and if
my memory serves me correctly,

you still owe me $50 in
royalties from my first album.

Your check's in the mail.

[all laughing]

So, Erin,
you're planning on unretiring?

Just for one performance.

I'd like to perform
with my granddaughter Hailey.

I want to raise some funds
for my son's defense.

And I thought you could help
us with the concert.

And then, you could release a
single of the live performance.

How does that sound?

Sounds really good.

I'm in. [chuckles]

Oh, there's just one
little problem.

You got to give me my 50 bucks.

[all laugh]

Come on.

All right.

Oh, there you go.
He hates this, you know?

[Bob chuckles]

[clears throat]

What?

I'm checking to see
if it's counterfeit.

[Bob laughing]

Once I was paralyzed, I wanted to figure
out how to do everything by myself.

Saddle, jump on, everything.

How long ago was your accident?
Four years.

And you haven't ridden since?
No, Ma'am.

It's probably time
for you to get back on.

[mellow music playing]

Now it's your turn.
[chuckles]

Don't be afraid to use
him for balance.

Let me get your leg.

You're going to help her leg?

I'm just going to grab you,
okay?

Hold that side and then you pull yourself.
One, two, three.

[Amberly] How's that feel?
Weird.

Get comfortable.

Everything we do now is with our
body, our hands, and our voice.

Okay.

You're ready?

Yeah.
Let's go.

There she is.

There she is.

Well, I haven't played
in a while, so...

All right.

Do you remember that song we
used to sing together, grandma?

I do.

You're about ten years old
and already so talented.

[both laughing]

[country music playing]

[crickets chirping]

[indistinct chatter]

What's he doing here?

We needed another guitarist so my
grandma asked him to join the band.

Is that all right?

I don't care.

Can he even play that thing?

[guitar music playing]


He's okay.

contributions?

As soon as I hit this button,
campaign goes live.

Hey, it's pretty sleek.

And the money starts flowing in.

Where does it go?
Directly into our bank account.

Sweet. Oh, I'm gonna go
check on grandma.

Okay.


How're you doing, Grandma?

Oh, I'm fine.

Oh, fiddlesticks.

Not really.

This is the first time I've
performed since the accident.

I know.

Just feels so strange
with him not here.

Well, if grandpa was here right
now, you know what he'd say?

"Keep your face toward the sunshine
and let shadows fall behind."

That is exactly
what he would say.

[both laughing]


Well, then let's get back
up on that horse.

Now you're talking.

[indistinct chatter]

Hey, Miss Mays.
[applause]

Oh, stop that.

Come on over here.

Everybody gather up.


"Lord, we thank
You for this moment.

"The road hasn't been easy...

"but we know that You have
a plan for each of us...

"and we ask Your blessing
as we perform in Your name.

"Amen."

Amen.

Well, y'all ready to do this?

Yeah.
Let's hit it. - Let's go.

Introducing, the sophisticated
lady of country music,

the amazing, Erin Mays and her
granddaughter, Hailey Mays.

Let's give them
a big round of applause.

[audience cheering]

[woman 6] We love you!


Thank you so much
for coming tonight.

As a lot of you know
I haven't performed in a while.

[man 3] We miss you!
But life goes on

and here I am.

[audience cheering]

I am so proud to be singing
tonight with my granddaughter,

Miss Hailey Mays.

[man 4] Erin!

Hey, everyone.
Um, some of y'all may know,

this concert is to help
raise money for my dad

who is currently
in Grady County Jail.

We're hoping to raise enough
money to bail him out of jail

and find a defense
for when his case goes to trial.

My grandma wrote a new song

and y'all are about to witness
the world premiere.

Here's <i>Miles To Go</i>.

<i>â™ª Remember in
That cold clear night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You looked at me
And took my hand â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Everything

Thank you.
Well, y'all are in for a big treat.

Not only is my granddaughter
Hailey a wonderful singer,

she's a wonderful songwriter.

And she's about
to sing my favorite.

Woo! Go, Hailey!

[mellow music playing]

<i>â™ª Since you left
I've been trying â™ª</i>

From the flames â™ª</i>

Guys, we just passed $50,000.

Yeah!

Wow, yes, awesome!


Look, there she is!
Thank y'all.

Thank you so much.
Thanks for coming.

Excuse me.
Could we get your autograph?

For sure.
Thank you.

Of course.
Did y'all enjoy the show?

We loved you.
You were really good.

You two tell all your friends
about her, all right?

We will.
We will.

Thank you, all.
Thank you, guys.

All right, I'm gonna head home.

The party's just starting.

No, no.

I'm too tired
but Marcos is giving me a ride.

Oh, okay.

Well, good night.

Thank you, Rufus,
for everything.

Of course.

Thanks, Rufus.
Yeah.

[guitar music playing]

<i>â™ª Didn't want to live like
Everyone else â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Always thought I was so free â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Destined to rely
On only myself â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Only taking care of me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And you came along â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You proved me wrong â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You knocked down the walls
Till I could see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Didn't know what
I was missing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Till you were standing next
To me â™ª</i>

I just thought Hailey
was just amazing.

She was good.
What? [chuckles]

I don't know about anybody else,

but you had me in the palm
of your hands. [laughing]

Thank you so much for coming to the
concert tonight, walking me to my car.

I had a wonderful time.

It was nice performing
again and...


it was extra special
because you were there.

You know, Erin, I don't lead
a very exciting life.

So I can't offer you what you
may be accustomed to.

Well, I'm not looking
for exciting.

I'm looking for kind,
steady and thoughtful...

a good person and I sense
that's who you are.

Thank you.

I feel the same about you.

[both chuckle]

Well, good night.

Good night, Erin.

<i>â™ª You came along
You proved me wrong â™ª</i>

Wait, look.

Wow! Check that out.

Oh, would you look at that?

Our own little stage.

Well, I'm honored.
[both laughing]

Come here.

<i>â™ª How could
I forget the Oklahoma stars â™ª</i>

meteor shower.

It's caused
by Halley's Comet tail.

I thought you were a singer not an astronomer.
[both laughing]

Well, the only reason
I know what it is,

is because my parents told me

I was conceived the night
of the Orionid meteor shower.

Halley's Comet won't be
back for 40 years,

but showers caused by its tail.

It's beautiful.

Yeah.

I think you're beautiful too,
Hailey.

<i>â™ª So good [inaudible] â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So good
It feels like make-believe â™ª</i>

[Hailey] Did you see that one?
I did, yeah. It was cool.

<i>â™ª Didn't know what I was missing
Didn't know what I was missing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Didn't know
What I was missing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Till you were standing next
To me â™ª</i>

After you, Miss Brooke.

Hi, I would like to withdraw
money from an account.

Okay, sure. Can you please swipe your card?
Yeah.

Um, I'm sorry, but it looks like
there's no money in this account.

There's... there's $50,000
in that account.

I see there was but it looks like
a withdrawal was made this morning.

$50,540.

Was it made by Rufus Gibbs?

Yes, it looks like he and another
young man were here this morning.

I'm so sorry.

It's okay.
Thank you for your help.

Rufus, what did you do?

Calm down.
I can't understand you.

Where are you?

Okay. Stay right there.

[suspenseful music playing]

What happened?

Hailey, I am so sorry.

That was the surest bet
of my life,

but the jockey
didn't ride a good race

and the horse
didn't stand a chance.

What are you talking about?

We lost it.

You went along with this,
Marcos?

Why didn't you stop him?

He said that we could
double your money. I...

He said that it was a guarantee
and that he had an inside tip.

I... I thought it sounded
like a good idea.

Gambling with my father's money
sounded like a good idea?

How much did y'all lose?


[breathing heavily]

This is $1,000.

I am so sorry.

You sound pathetic.

No, you're both pathetic.

Rufus has a lot of problems.
But you, you don't have an excuse.

You know what?

Keep the money.

Come on, Brooke.
Unbelievable.

Hailey. Hailey. I'm sorry.

This isn't gonna change
things, is it?

No, it changes everything.

Last night...

last night, I thought
we shared something special

and you were this guy that I
could imagine myself being with,

but today...

I see you're just some
stupid loser.

Come on, Brooke, let's go.

[mellow music playing]

[phone buzzing]

[horse neighing]

What?

What are you doing?

What does it look
like I'm doing?

Brooke,
you are not ready to ride.

Grandma or Amberley should be here.
I am ready.

Just watch me. Giddy-up.

Come on, giddy-up.
This is crazy.


What's she doing?

I don't know.
I tried to stop her.

Come on, Brooke.
You got it.

[Brooke groans]
[thuds]

Brooke!
Brooke!


Okay, honey.
Where are you hurt?

Everywhere.

I hurt everywhere,
my leg, my heart

because grandpa's gone
and dad's in jail.

And nothing's been the same
since the accident.

The accident was my fault.

Oh, no. It's okay.

Your grandpa loved both
of you girls so much.

And, you know,
sometimes things just happen

and there's just no
rhyme or reason.

You know, you could
twist yourself all up

trying to figure out why...

and there ain't no why.

But we just got
to keep going, right?

And we got to remember
all of those who are with us.

And the last thing grandpa
would have wanted

was for us to be sad
or feel guilty.

He'd want us to live
our lives to the fullest.

Right?

So you sing
and you barrel race...

and fall in love...

and make your grandpa proud...


...because he is watching
over all of us.

Okay?

Hey, Maddie, just checking in.

Call me back
when you get a chance.

All right, bye.

I wonder where she is?

I don't know.
[mobile chimes]

Can you believe Rufus
just turned 18 today?

He said he was 19.
I thought he was 12.

[birds chirping]

Which means he was 17 last week.

[door opens]

Grandma, can you give
us a ride somewhere?

Mr. Daniels is just pulling up.
Come on, we'll take you.

[car approaches]

Mr. Daniels,
can we give the girls a ride?

Sure, ladies. Come on.

Yeah, yeah. Listen, I need you to
meet us at that horse betting place.

Can you be there in ten minutes?
Rufus.

Rufus, just come, okay?

Okay, see you there.

Hailey, I'm telling you,
there's no way to get the money back.

Will you at least help me try?
[people cheering on TV]

Now, I'll do whatever I can.

Okay, who did you place
your bets with?

The guy at the end there,
George.


Um, hi, George.

You know Rufus, right?
Hi, George.

Yeah. Hey, Rufus.

Are you sure you want
to try this again? [chuckles]

Well, you see, George,
the $50,000 that Rufus lost last week

also belonged to me,
so we're here to get it back.

Yeah, well,
that ain't gonna happen.

All bets are final.

It ain't my problem
he lost your money, lady.

Well, you see,
it actually is your problem

because Rufus was a minor when you took
all those bets from him and that's illegal.

Whoa... hey!

I didn't know he's a minor.
Yes, you did.

You were charging 20 percent for
the risk that you were taking.

Okay, look. So even if I did,
and I ain't saying I did...

you got no proof
he was ever even here.

I don't know. I mean, come on.

With the face like this, I don't think
people around here could forget it.

Thanks.

And taking a $50,000 bet from
a minor sounds pretty bad to me.

It was actually a $40,000 bet.

He took the 10,000
for himself off top.

Well, it's getting
worse and worse.

Oh, actually, it's a criminal
offense with a pretty stiff penalty.

You know, all right,
all right, all right.

I'll give you
the lousy ten grand.

You can bet
on any horse you like.

The last race is in ten minutes,

so you ain't got a whole lot
of time, Sister.

Okay. We'll do it.

Hailey, are you sure you want
to let Rufus bet that money?

He doesn't have a very
good track record.

No pun intended.
What else can we do?

$10,000 isn't gonna help dad.

Just have to pray.
Okay.

Looks like there's a lot of
praying going on around here.

[alarm blares]
[indistinct announcement]

What about For The Win?

No, no, no, no, no.
For The Win is only two to one.

There are three horses
that are five to one,

your best bet is going
to be Silent Speed.

The best time
last three races, good jockey.

Are you sure?
I'm sure, Hailey.

I can feel it in my bones.

Normally, I would not condone
betting on a horse race.

But these are not normal times.

Let's do it.

the tenth and last race of the day.</i>

Come on, Silent Speed.

<i>Yeah, come on, Silent speed.</i>
[Hailey] Go, Silent Speed.

Come on, come on!

Get the lightening out,
Silent Speed. Come on!

Come on, come on.

second and third.</i>

<i>For The Win making his move on the inside.</i>
Come on. Come on.

For The Win takes the lead by a nose.</i>

<i>Silent Speed tries to make a move on the outside...</i>
[Brook] Come on, Silent Speed.

maintains lead for third.</i>

<i>At the finish,</i>

<i>it's For The Win at first place
followed by Silent Speed in second</i>

<i>and Peter Piper shows for third.</i>

Hailey, I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

I know. We'll figure it out.

an update from today's final race.</i>

<i>For The Win
has been disqualified</i>

<i>and Silent Speed
moves up to first.</i>

<i>Peter Piper goes into second...</i>

No way!
Are you kidding me?

Yes! Yeah!
[all cheering]

Yes!
We did it.

We got them!


Can y'all believe that?

Oh, I almost had a heart attack.
[Hailey laughing]

You really love money,
don't you?

What's not to like about 50K?
All right.

Um... Okay. Hey, Maddie, uh,

just trying to get
a hold of you again.

Got some really great news,

so I don't know, call me back
when you get a chance.

All right. Bye.

[ambulance siren wailing]

We need to follow that ambulance.
Grandma! Mr. Daniels!


We found her unresponsive
on her kitchen floor.

Are any of you related
to Maddie?

Uh, we're her close friends.

I don't think
she has any family.

How is she?

She's stable, but her lupus
is more serious than we thought.

I feel we need to move on to the
next step which is immunotherapy.

Uh, when can you start that?

Well, the treatment
is very expensive

and she doesn't have
health insurance.

So we can't do it at this time.

Um, what will happen to her
if you can't do the treatment?

Her condition
will worsen over time

and her episodes
will become more severe.

I wish I had better
news for you.

One of you can go see her now.

Go ahead, honey.
Okay.

[indistinct chatter]

Hey.
Hey.

Hey.

I have a flair
for the dramatic, don't I?

Some people will do
anything for attention.

[both chuckling]

That's me, drama queen.
Mm-hmm.

How do you feel?

Okay.

Doctor says I need some
expensive new drug,

but I told her...

I'm a waitress, so...

You're gonna be okay, Maddie.

That's nice of you
to say that...

but I've been dealing
with this my whole life and...

it was bound to catch up
with me one of these days.

I don't want you to lose hope.

Okay, Maddie.

It looks like I need
to get some blood.

Yippie.

And this is where I exit.
Extreme needle phobia.

Lightweight.
Um...

We'll all be in the waiting
room if you need us.

Okay.

[somber music playing]

She's resting.

Thank you all so much
for being here.

Of course, we'd be here.

Are y'all thinking
what I'm thinking?

I think we are.

Do you mean use this
money for Maddie?

What about daddy?

Oh, honey, he'll understand.

And he'll be all right.

And I'll just unretire again
and we'll raise some more money.

Y'all, that's too much
to ask of you.

It's the right thing
to do, Collin.

That money right there was
meant for Maddie's treatment.

You know, Erin, uh, everyone,
I didn't want to overstep,

but, um, before I retired
in my early career,

I was a pretty
successful attorney.

You were?
Among other things.

So I'd be happy to unretire
and take your son's case.

Pro bono, of course.

What's pro bono?
Means for free.

Ah. Wow! Thank you.

Yeah, thank you, Mr. Daniels.
You're welcome.

And in order to better
serve your son,

first thing I'd do is weigh the jury
and, uh, request a bench trial.

Well, you sound like you know what you're talking about.
[chuckles]

We gratefully accept.

It would be my pleasure.

It looks like
you got some visitors.

Thank you.

Hey, guys.
Hey.

Thank you. - Thank you.
Yeah. Of course.

Um, Maddie, we have something
important to tell you.

We just want you to know
that we have all agreed on this.

Even Rufus.

We've decided to use the money
from the fundraiser

to help pay
for your treatment.

No, you guys.

It's what we're gonna do.
Yeah.

Oh, thank you so much.
Oh, my gosh!

Of course.
Thank you.

Yeah. You're gonna be okay.

When you agreed to drive
the truck for Mr. Robins,

did you know the truck
was full of TVs?

Yes, Sir. I did.

And, uh, did you know these
TVs were stolen?

No, Sir. I thought I was doing
a favor for a friend.

Even though you knew this friend
had a history of criminal activity?

Yes, Sir. I...
I believe people can change.

He assured me that he had.

Well, exactly how long have you
and Mr. Robins been friends?

My whole life. Uh, we went
to grammar school together.

He got me my first real job.
He was a good friend to me.

I would ask the defense Exhibit 1 be
entered into the record for evidence.

It's a copy of an email from Mr. Mays to
Mr. Bill Robins from one month before.

I need Mr. Mays
to read a portion of it.

Response?
No objections.

Admitted.

Mr. Mays, would you please
read the last two lines?

"I know times have been rough
for you the past few years, Bill,

"but I want you to know
that I'm here for you

"and if there's anything I can
help you with, you can call me.

"You've always been
a good friend of me..."

Your Honor, Mr. Mays is a hard-working
citizen with no prior records.

I do see a breaking
and entering.

Oh, that was when he was a minor
and it was taken off his record.

Yes, I see that.

He's had the same job for ten
years with the same employer.

He's also a family man
with two lovely daughters,

but the prosecution has sucked
Mr. Mays into this case

as a smokescreen to take
the spotlight off Mr. Robins,

who is the true guilty party.

I, therefore,
respectfully request

that the court declare a mistrial
in its case against Mr. Mays

and that he be
immediately released.

That should be fine.
I'll talk to you later.

[Rufus] Hey, Hailey.
Hey.

Fingers crossed
for a good verdict.

I'm sorry. That sounded stupid
because you know what I mean.

I know what you mean.

Hey, you didn't bet
on my dad's trial, did you?

No, no. Of course not. I...

I'm actually trying not
to do that anymore.

I've been going
to these meetings

and I'm hoping to put
my gambling days behind me.

That sounds really good, Rufus.

I'll see you inside.
Sure.

[Marcos] Hey.
Hey.

Thank you for coming.
You didn't have to.

Well, of course. Yeah, I had to.


Listen, Marcos, I was pretty
hard on you the other day.

Hailey, there's... there's
no need to apologize.

I should have stopped Rufus,

but, instead,
I went along with him.

I feel terrible.
No, don't feel terrible.

I forgive you.

And, hey, uh, once this is all
over, I thought we could hang out...

...but just as friends.

Yeah, I'd like that.

Me too.
[clock chimes]

All right.
It's time for the verdict.

arguments under careful consideration.

It's hard to completely
exonerate Mr. Mays,

but the State
has the burden of proof

which it has not met
in this case.

Therefore, I find Mr. Mays not guilty of
transporting contraband across state lines.

[all cheering]

But I do find you guilty of not
using your common sense.

Mr. Mays, the next time an
ex-con asks you to drive a truck

full of valuable cargo
across the state line,

I hope you think twice.

I will, Your Honor.

In the meantime, you won't
be able to drive for six months

because I'm suspending
your license

and I'm fining you $548 for the
original probable cause of speeding.

You're free to go, Mr. Mays.
Court is adjourned.

Yeah!

[all laughing]
[applause]

Whoo.

<i>Well, one thing's for sure.</i>

<i>Life is never boring.</i>

<i>And it's not
a straight line at all.</i>

<i>It twists and turns and usually we
never know where it's gonna take us.</i>

we got a good one for you.</i>

<i>"Chickasha's own,"</i> Hailey

Is this you on the radio?

I mean, it's the local radio
but, yeah, it is.

I discovered her by the way.
That was me.

I'm so proud of you.
