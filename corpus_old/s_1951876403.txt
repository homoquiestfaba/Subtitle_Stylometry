Please help me...

help...
somebody please help me.

Somebody please help me.

Please help me.

You're doing a very
good thing here, Nancy.

You know the good book says
that there is no greater love...

than when a man lays down
his life for another.

You're my hero, Nancy.

No!

Okay, easy does it.

That's it.

No! No!

Help! Help! Somebody help!
Please help!

Detective Ferguson. I need backup.
Send a bus and three units.

Help...
Is he still here?

Yeah.
I need you to be quiet.

Look!
I need you to be quiet...

if you wanna get out of
here alive. You understand?

I heard lots of screaming...

Be quiet.

Help... me. Please untie me.
Keep it down.

No, don't leave me here!
Quiet.

Smile. Smile.

Oh, yes.

This was for the girls, but
I guess it works on cops, too.

Well, good morning, sleepy-head.

How you feeling today?

I feel alive, that's for sure.

Yeah, you were out for
quite some time.

Here.

Were you in my bathroom
last night?

No.

Somebody was.

Uou weren't even supposed
to wake up until tomorrow.

Somebody was in my bathroom
last night.

It's probably just a bad dream.

I want you to take it easy. Don't
put too much stress on your heart.

Hey, what's wrong?
He's gonna kill her!

Lay down,
I need you to relax, okay?

Lie down, and take a couple
deep breaths for me, okay?

Come on.

You need to take it easy or you're
gonna tear your sutures apart.

No, I've gotta get out of here.
You're in no condition.

He's gonna kill her!
In no condition!

You need to relax.
Lay down for me, would you?

Nice caretaker, Nicky.
Captain.

Nick, did you get
a good look at him?

No, not really.

I was too busy watching him plunge
a needle into my heart.

Are there any more victims?

Not to my knowledge.

Well, as soon as I get better,
I'll get back on the case.

Well, let's hope that's
sooner than later, Nicky.

The mother fucker's
a real predator.

It's like these killings are
pleasure crimes for him.

I got him on the run, now.

Not for long, I guarantee you.

This son of a bitch is gonna set up
shop elsewhere and strike again.

Let's not lay around here
too long now.

Spare change, sir?
I don't speak English, asshole.

Oh, ma'am, ma'am...
I'm sorry, I don't have any.

For a vet. I'm really
cold out at night.

This is all I have.
Gonna get something to eat...

I greatly appreciate.

Oh, that's very kind, ma'am.
Thank you.

<i>In local news, another Los Angeles
woman has gone missing.</i>

spanning the last few months,</i>

<i>Emily Boxer, a 21 year old college
student disappeared last night.</i>

<i>She was last seen in
the Huntington Park area.</i>

<i>Police are asking that who have
information pertaining to Emily...</i>

<i>please contact local police.</i>

Ferguson.

Who is this?

You have no idea who the fuck
you're dealing with.

Who the fuck is this?!

Hey, Nick.

You're looking much better.

Almost back to the old Nick.

That's bullshit and you know it.

Between the codeine pills, the Paxil,
I'm a walking chemical plant.

I haven't had a decent
night's sleep in weeks.

Yeah, well, we can't have
that now, can we?

Man like you can't be off
the hunt too long.

Listen, let's get back down
to business.

The son of a bitch struck close
to home this last time.

What do you mean?

My neighbor's kid.
Emily Boxer.

Freshman at Stanford
home for the weekend.

Let me guess, five seven, blonde,
green sweater, blue jeans.

How the fuck did you know that?

We just recently released that
information to the media.

I saw her last night.

What do you mean,
you saw her last night?

You told me your ass never left
the house last night.

I'm gonna tell you something,
Captain...

and you're probably gonna
think I'm crazy for it.

Probably,
but no more than usual.

I've been having these visions.

I'm not sure
if I'm asleep or awake...

but I've been seeing the girls.

After he's finished with them.

Okay, you're pulling my dick,
right?

Because that makes no sense
to me at all.

It makes no sense
to me either.

But ever since I had
this heart surgery...

I just keep getting
these goddamn visions.

I'm just gonna pretend
you didn't say that, Nick...

and tell you this...

I need you on the trail of
this son of a bitch.

You understand this man's thinking
better than any detective.

Let's be realistic about
the situation, shall we?

There's only so much
I can handle.

Especially with this new heart.

Come on, Nick. I need this
son of a bitch taken down.

Why you pushing me so hard
on this, Captain.

I've put my ass on the line
for you many times.

I'm not just spoutin'
gibberish here, okay?

Come on, Nick,
read between the lines.

And you owe me, Nick.

So what're you gonna do?

The Captain told me he was near
beggin' you to come back.

The captain doesn't understand
the concept of retirement.

Come on, man.

I'm sorry.

A lot of crazy shit's been
going down lately.

Crazy shit like what?

You'll think I'm insane.

I've been seeing the faces
of the victims...

before they're dead.

What? Man,
are you taking meds, man?

On and off, yeah.

Makes me feel like shit.

Without your medication you're
probably hallucinating.

Yeah, you're probably right.

Bartender, can I get the bill?

Look, man...

if there's anything you need, do not
hesitate to give me a call, man.

Yeah.

It'll be good to see you
around my office again.

I'm out of here, man.
Get your shit together.

A Jack.

Is this seat taken?

Help yourself.

Can I buy you a drink.

A diet coke is fine, please.

A diet coke as well.

Following the case much?

Very closely.

Here.

Thank you.

Name is Nick.

Kathryn Rose.

You were saying?

It's hard not to follow
the case.

All those innocent girls dying at
the hands of that ruthless murderer.

What's that look for?
You can see.

See what?
Do you hear them too, Nick?

Hear who?
The cries...

at night.

I don't know where you're going...
It's the cries of the dead.

Sure they didn't spike
that drink of yours?

Don't be alarmed by me, Nick.
I'm a psychic.

What, now you're looking for
new business?

I get the visions, too.

I see the girls after
they've been murdered.

Sometimes even before.

You've been blessed with
a gift also.

Wait...

you're saying you see the girls
in your visions. In your dreams.

Jesus Christ.

I thought I was going insane.

Well, you're the psychic.
What does it mean?

You have a direct entrance way into
the realm of the spirit worlds.

Use it to your advantage.

Maybe you'll figure out
a way to stop this animal.

Lady, how'd you even know
I was working the case?

I'm drunk off my ass, so take
your bullshit elsewhere.

Do you have another explanation for
what's been happening to you?

You stay the fuck away from me,
lady. You hear?

In here!

You have beautiful eyes.

Hello.

<i>- Bradley.
Captain.</i>

Hey, Nick.
You still among the living?

For now.

Given it some thought.

I want in.

You're sounding kind of like you're
in the same shape you was in before.

Why don't you get some rest?
I've got you covered.

Who's working the case?
Hang on.

Jenkins is gonna handle it.

Jenkins?
What are my options?

I can hand you this guy
on a silver platter.

What, more visions, Nick?

You sound like you're combining your
favorite drink with those pills.

Bradley,
you said it yourself...

I've gotten closer to this fucker
than anyone else has.

Now, Youngblood's looking at
the evidence found at the chamber.

He's getting back to me today.

How'd you get authorizaion
for him to do more tests?

<i>- I've got my methods.
Your methods?</i>

I should remind that mother fucker
who writes his checks.

<i>Look, am I in or not? I'll go it
alone on this one if I have to.</i>

All right, you're in, but find
this mother fucker fast.

What's up, Doc?

Slick Nick.
How you doin'?

Good, good.
What have you got for me?

Well, I've examined
the last victim's remains.

This guy was very thorough,
that's for sure.

Leaves nothing
to tip himself off.

So, why'd he bury the bodies?

To cover his tracks.

Take a look at how smooth
the bones are. Feel them.

Slicker than cat shit.

It's like from a skeletal model
rather than a real person's.

What's this?

Some of the remains show evidence
of a caustic substance...

but its burning the boans removes
any chance for a chemical match.

That's all you got?

I don't have his address or home
phone number, but I'm getting close.

All right.

Can you give me a minute?
Sure.

Why are you burning the bodies?

What're you hiding from us?

What're you keeping?

Keeping. Doc?

Can you have a look at this?

Bone saw marks.
That's what I thought.

Bastard's cutting them up
and he's taking the organs.

Well, I'll be.

That's why he's burning the bodies
to hide the evidence.

I want you to test those marks
against every saw known to man.

I'm on it.

Who are you?

Where did you slip?

<i>Tell me why you're here
this time.</i>

Mandatory follow up?

I don't know. Why don't you tell me
why you really think I'm here?

We wanna help you.
How?

By telling me I'm
an obsessive-compulsive?

Or is it a delusional
manic-depressive this week?

Tell me about Jessica.

Let's not go there,
shall we?

Why not?

Nick, you lost your wife.

We can't help you
if you won't let us.

Why don't you just
up my Prozac?

No, we need to talk about it.

Forget it.

Rachel, yeah,
send in my next patient.

I know his hour isn't up yet,
just do what I tell you.

This is my hour.

Then why don't you spare me
the tough cop routine?

And, of the record? You touch me
again and I'll rip your arm off.

Now you got my attention, Doc.

Tell me about Jessica.

That asshole blew her brains
out all over the kitchen.

What's left to say?

Sometimes I still find
memories of her...

like a hair in the blanket
in the closet...

or under the bed.

It says you're having dreams.

Are you dreaming about her.
No.

They're not dreams, Doc.

They're, uh, visions.

I've been seeing the girls
after they're killed.

How often?

Every night.

Nick, are you drinking
when you take your meds?

Let's not go through
that as well.

What does my profile say?

Burgeoning alcoholic?

You can't combine alcohol
and antidepressants.

That is what's giving you
these dreams.

You know, you fucking
people amaze me.

You get us hooked on the chemical,
then you tell us what happens to us.

Listen to me.

These visions are nightmares...

induced by the effects of
alcohol and Prozac.

These visions are real. It's not
the booze and it's not the pills.

Now, if you had a stitch of talent,
you'd wanna know about 'em.

So you can take your hour
and shove it up your ass.

It's nicer during the day.

Hello?

Can I help you with something?

In here!
Would somebody help me!

Help me!

<i>Bradley, I'm not going crazy.
This shit really happened.</i>

I'm beginning to wonder if I made
a mistake by placing you on this case.

Now you're second-guessing me?
No, Nick, it's just...

Iook, you need your head
thoroughly examined.

Dr. Allbright informed me
about your last session.

I know you wanna catch this guy,
but your health comes first?

Better not be saying you're
pulling me from the case.

Do me a favor, Nick.
Go get some rest, huh?

I'm busting my ass to solve this case
and this is the thanks I get?

Look, Nick...

If I can't talk to you about this,
then who can I talk to?

Nick, my door is always
open for you.

I just wanna see
the old Nick back in action.

There's no harm in that, right?

So what exactly
are we looking for?

Whatever it is, there's something
not right in here.

You better not be
setting me up, Kathryn.

Doesn't look like much of
a transportation company.

Kathryn, how'd you know
that was in there?

I'm just trying to help.

What exactly are you
getting out of this?

It's the right thing
to do, isn't it?

You and I both get visions
that are tied to this case.

We're connected in a way that
no one else can understand.

If I get premonitions that
can help solve these crimes...

you're the only one
I can turn to.

What're you afraid of, Nick?

You're the psychic.
You tell me.

You're afraid of loss...

because of the way
you lost your wife.

Don't fucking go there.

Everyone experiences lost,
Nick...

but not everyone
experiences love...

which is what made your
wife's death more tragic.

But no matter what
you believe...

it wasn't your fault.

I'm not discussing
this any further.

Running away doesn't put any more
distance between you and the past.

Detective Ferguson. I need a CSI unit
down here at Huntington Park.

A report just arrived this morning.
You've got impeccable timing.

And I know who the remains
belong to as well.

What're you trying
to do my job, too?

Just read it, will you, Doc?

Victim, Emily Marie Boxer.

Address 1150 Seward Street.

Are you sure?
How did they call it?

Dental records
were a spot-on match.

Captain's gonna be
shittin' bricks.

I don't know who leaked it
to the press.

Certainly not one of my people.

Listen, you don't have to
tell me that, all right?

We've gotta run some quick
damage control on this!

Yeah, Roland, my best man
has a good lead.

We're on this prick's scent.

Yeah. I understand, Roland.
Yes. Goodbye.

Fucking media. How did they find out
it was Emily before you did?

I dunno. Youngblood only got
the file this morning.

Those fucking leeches. They'll
sell information for anything.

I think they fucking
enjoy this shit.

Bradley, make it good.

It's Youngblood, Captain.
I need to find Nick.

Fine. Hang on. Nick.
Youngblood.

Ferguson.

<i>I hope the Captain knows the media
leak did not come from me.</i>

Nah, he knows you didn't
leak it to the media.

<i>Thank God.</i>

I forgot to tell you. We've done
the legwork on those surgical saws.

What have you got for me?

<i>I can't say you're
gonna like it. We've got nothing.</i>

How difficult is it to trace
the origin of a surgical saw?

<i>More difficult
than I thought, buddy.</i>

<i>Seems the cuts left by each brand
of blade are nearly identical.</i>

<i>We'd have to have the suspect
blade to compare it.</i>

<i>Even then, it could take weeks.</i>

Thanks, Doc.
I'm sorry, buddy.

Let me guess...

another dead end, right?
I'll keep working on it.

I hope this working on it has nothing
to do with your visions.

How did you find Emily's remains,
anwyay?

I've got my sources, Captain.
Your sources.

The press has its vultures planted
here leaking information.

Your sources had better be
air fucking tight.

Since when do you not
trust me, Captain?

Oh, I trust the real Nick.

It's this drugged-up deluded Nick
that I've got questions about.

You're gonna take that
shrink's word over mine?

Oh, come on, Nick. Nobody's
put you on leave, right?

Look, Nick... word is you're
losing it, man.

Captain,
I'm in this guy's head.

I don't know why...

I don't know how,
but I'm there.

I just need a bit more time.

That's something
we're running out of.

<i>The number is not in service
and there is no new number.</i>

<i>Please check the telephone directory
for the right number.</i>

<i>This is a recording.</i>

<i>When a person dies
before their time...</i>

<i>especially an unjust dead...</i>

<i>their spirit remains earthbound until
they can find peace and move on.</i>

<i>That's what's happening here.</i>

<i>I need your help.</i>

<i>Did you see or hear anything else
at all in your visions.</i>

<i>He goes by many names.</i>

<i>But several women in my visions
have called him Teddy.</i>

Search for Dr. Ted or Teddy,
with malpractice suits...

or had his license revoked
in the last five years.

Okay, got it.

Hold on.

But what makes you so sure
this guy's a doctor?

Just call it a hunch.

Detective Ferguson, right?

Thank you for your time,
Dr. Nichols.

What's this about?

About a malpractice suit...
That's been settled.

It's been years,
Detective Ferguson.

Why bring up ancient history?

Yeah. It has been years,
hasn't it?

But a patient of yours had a kidney
removed without permission.

She lived...

and I no longer assume
any medical capacity.

Aren't you the head doctor here
at the Sunshine facility?

I'm the head administrator. I make
no medical decisions here.

Your patients thank you, Doctor.
We're done here.

Any further discussion will be with
my attorney present. Understand?

Hey! What are you doing?

Get your God damn hands off me!

Say it again to my face.
You're crazy!

You may well just be right.

Thanks for your time.

Dee, Dee, Dee, don't sweat it.

Look, this Kennison guy never
returned any of my calls.

I'm checking out his address.

It's 5609 Soto Street.

If you don't hear from me soon,
send some backup.

We meet again.

No heart this time.

I'm gonna finish it this time.

Stay right where you are.

What's that smell?

Did you smell that?

So what's it gonna be?
It's your call.

You want me that bad, you're gonna
have to blow us both to Hell.

Can you take that shot?

Come on.

Show me what you got.

Show me.

Boom.

Don't you fucking test me,
asshole.

You already failed that test
ten years ago, detective.

Remember, it was like this. That
guy held a gun to your wife's temple...

but you were too chickenshit
to take the shot.

You remember that, detective?

Don't you fucking test me,
asshole!

You wanted to see me,
Captain?

So, what did the doctor say?

Couple scrapes.
A few stitches.

Patched me up pretty good.

I can still use the arm.

Is that it?

Looks like you read the report.
Yeah, fuckin' a I read the report.

You lost him again.

Tell me something I don't know.

Jesus Christ, Ferguson,
that's twice now.

Have you seen the news?

Matter of fact,
I haven't found the time.

Well I'm beginning
to feel the heat.

We all got problems, Captain.

All right, listen to me.

If someone's gotta
get fucked here...

I'm gonna be the one
doing the fucking, okay?

The chief is crawling up
my ass, Nick.

The man wants to launch an
investigation into this department.

So let him.
Let him?

Since when did you give a shit about
these ass-kissing politicians?

I have a family, Nick.

I've got two twins about
ready to go to college...

and I've got two other
mouths to feed.

This shit's gotta
work out for me.

Let's stop dicking around
here then, shall we?

Ferguson!

Sit down.

How many times have
I bailed you down, Nick?

Don't think I don't
appreciate it, Captain.

After Jessica was murdered...

you tried to drink your way to the
bottom of every bottle you could find.

After your brutal
arresting sprees...

where you seemed to blame every
perp for killing Jessica.

I arrested and convicted more
perps in this department.

At what cost, Nick?

I had to pick up the pieces after
you knocked that kid's teeth out.

You didn't knock
that kid's teeth out.

What you did was perform medieval
denistry on him for petty theft!

I ought to take you off this case.
Excuse me?

I can't take the fall
for you anymore.

Have I ever let you down?

Then just give me another shot!

Not this time, Nick

I found the fucking guy!
And you fucking lost him!

Again!

Fine. Then I'll go it alone.
Nobody above you needs to know.

Ferguson!
We're not finished yet.

I need your badge, Nick.

I've been ordered to
suspend you.

Your badge, Nick.

Aren't you forgetting
something?

How long?

Until you stop trying to
avenge Jessica's death.

Go on home, son. Heal up.

Let it go.

Jesus, Kathryn.

You almost gave me
a heart attack.

I'm sorry.
I thought I'd surprise you.

Yeah, well, you did.

How'd you get it?
The door was open.

How're you feeling?

We need to talk.

I've been suspended.

I'm on my own now.

I'm here for you.

Did I say something wrong?

No, no. My wife, she had a lot of
similar qualities to you.

Those we love never die.

She's still with you, Nick.
Never left.

I'm sure she believed in you
like I believe in you.

Yeah.

I couldn't protect those girls.

I couldn't protect her.

Don't lose your faith.

Once that's gone, you'll lose
yourself in the process.

You even sound like a shrink.

Therapy's not a bad thing,
Nick.

Who are you? Really.

Where'd you come from?

Fate led me to you.

Just out of curiosity, and I hope
you don't mind me asking this...

but why are you putting
so much faith in me?

You can't turn your back on
this case, Nick.

Why not?

The voices will intensify
and drive you insane.

You can't escape them.

They'll eat at you every day and
destroy everything that you are.

You really think you know
who I am, don't you?

If you don't finish this,
they'll never leave you alone.

Jesus, Nick! It's me!
Shit!

I think I shit my pants.

Too close, Youngblood.

Where the fuck's your car?
I took the bus.

Those morons from the lab
they see me with you?

This partnership comes to
an unhappy close.

All right,
what'd you bring me?

You didn't have enough DNA on
the manakins to run a full test.

Those morons investigate the crime
scene. They're idiots.

Then I go in and
I get the real evidence.

How'd you do that?
I've got my methods.

You don't think I've learned
a few things from you?

The old Nick, maybe.

The old Nick? Maybe you need
to snap out of it.

Twenty matches?

You're saying he has at least
twenty different victims.

That's just the tip of the iceberg.
He's been doing it for years.

Who knows how many?

Mabel Kennison. Is that?

Teddy's mother.

Her death certificate
and accompanying report.

And I haven't even told you
the sickest shit yet.

The head is Mabel's, too.

You're fucking kidding me.

No, read it. It's all there.

It says here she died
of natural causes.

She was buried, body intact,
favorite wool suit...

gold necklace.

Pretty standard burial. So what?
So what?

Can I have some of that?
Yeah.

So...

he goes to his mother's grave
the night she's buried...

'cause the head would decay
if he didn't get it in time...

digs up her body,
opens the coffin...

and cuts off her fuckin' head.
Then takes it...

And puts it in formaldehyde
to preserve it.

Exactly.

Fuck me.

Me too.

So, you get the pattern,
Slick?

This guy's not too nice to
the people in his circle.

You need to watch your back.

Thanks for meeting me here.
Meeting?

What meeting?

Cheers.
Cheers.

What are you doing?

Shit.

Shit.

Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!

Surprise!

Don't you like a good surprise
party, detective?

You been looking for me,
detective.

Well, here I am.

Go ahead! Do it!

I'm gonna do it, detective, but
we're gonna have some fun first.

Fuck you!
Not that kind of fun, detective.

I've got a little
surprise for you.

You stay right there, okay.

We're gonna have us
a slumber party!

Goodnight, sweet prince.

This is gonna be fun.

Real fun.

Save the children...

save the children...

it's okay.

We're going to save the children.
This is a good thing.

We're gonna save the children.

Let's wake our guest up,
shall we?

Hello?

Hello, wakey.

Wakey, wakey.

Wakey wakey wakey wakey wakey.

Hey, good morning to ya.

Hello, there.

Look here, you do this,
and I'll fucking...

No, I don't think so. No!

What am I thinking?
I lost my head.

We, Wendy, have to be on our best
behavior. Remember that.

You sick son of a bitch.
We have to have good manners.

You're not gonna
get away with this!

You don't think so?

I beg to differ.

I'll prove it to ya.

I'm sorry Wendy...

but...

we have to prove a point, here.

Are you watching this?

You know, without teeth,
they can't identify the body.

Do one more? Okay.

Look at this.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, we'll get
the rest of 'em later.

What, didn't your mother
pay enough attention?

My mother?

You don't bring my mother
into this.

You leave my mother out of this.
Leave my mother alone.

You hear that?
My mother loved me!

My mother loved me!
She loved me!

So now you're playing God?
No. Not God.

Maybe the son of God.
Aren't we all sons of God?

The work we're doing here.

We will save millions and millions
of lives all over the world.

All over the world.

She's doing her part.
I'm doing mine.

What are you going to contribute?
A kidney, maybe?

No! Fuck!
What? Look at that.

Mother fucker!
That's it. Perfection.

You know that child that needs
a kidney in Africa?

Well, I am a god to her.
I am a god to her.

There we go. And God said
let there be light.

Look at that. That's beautiful.
It's all working. Such wholeness.

You can cut a liver up four or five
times and save five children.

You can do that.
Did you know that?

With one liver from one slut you
can save five children in Africa.

I got some major shit brewin'.
I'm talkin' some good shit.

Shoot.

I just received a phone call from
a doctor who worked with Teddy Kennison.

The two met at med school, and he
knows the guy like the back of his hand.

And?

I'm meeting up with him to get
the lowdown on this guy.

All right, keep me informed.

Absolutely, Captain.
You got it.

Hey, hey, Dee?
Yeah?

You talk to Nick today?

Nah, I haven't heard from him.
Why? Is everything cool.

Yeah, yeah,
it's probably nothing.

I just had a conversation with
one of your colleagues.

He's gonna pay us
a visit shortly.

Who is it?

You'll know soon enough. I'll make
sure he stops by to say hello.

And in case you're wondering,
detective.

I'm gonna remove the rest of
her teeth after the acid bath.

It's just a matter of time, Teddy.
You know that, right?

They're closing in as we speak.

Good, although by the time they get
here there won't be anything left.

I hear arson is a bad problem
in this neighborhood.

And sadly, that's what
we're gonna have to do.

Burn it all to the ground.

What a waste.

You know, detective...

you and me have a lot
in common.

Although you chase the bad guys
and I run from the cops...

it's all about the details,
isn't it? Attention to detail.

That's bullshit and you know it.
We're nothing alike at all.

I'm sorry you feel that way.

Details.

We'll chat later.

Remember, I'm expecting
a guest later.

Doctor Clark?
Detective Danielson.

Dr. Clark.

Hello?

Dr. Clark?

Nick! What the fuck, man?

I've got you!

You're next.

This is it. This is the moment
you've been waiting for.

It's useless.

Relax yourself, my boy. Somebody's
gonna get that heart of yours.

Someone's gonna get
that heart of years.

Wait a minute. That's not even
your heart, is it?

You can go fuck yourself.

I'll remember you said that while I
watch you draw your last breath.

Stay the fuck where you are.

Captain, it's Nick.

Yeah, I got him.

1199.

Yeah, everyone.

1030 Vignes Street.

This guy
was no ordinary madman.

Tell me something
I don't know.

He was one sick fuck.

We found the lab computer,
which Teddy kept clean.

Then we found the laptop buried in
one of those store rooms.

What was on it?

Some guys like to do their Jack
the Ripper impersonation.

Not our guy.

He was a key member of
an organ theft conspiracy.

He would sell the organs to hospitals
in the region and all of the world.

Teddy...

clearly OCD...

kept detailed records
all in code.

He would track whose organs they
took and where they would go.

Once we cracked the code, we matched
the records with missing persons.

Emily Boxer, Wendy Simmons,
Kathryn Rose.

What is it, Slick?

I know. It's tough to see
that many faces, isn't it?

This can't be.

What?

You know her?

You sure about her?
Yeah.

Dental records were a match.

How did you know this
Kathryn Girl, anwyay?

I just do. Did.

Well, it's funny.

'Cause we were able to trace some of
her organs back to general.

They type-matched her DNA with
a heart donated by a Jane Doe...

on October 31, last year.

That's Halloween.

Jesus, that's rich.

What day?

October 31.

You were admitted
the same day...

and you had
the same blood type.

You...
you have her heart.

Jesus...
what are the odds of that?

Vegas, baby.
All the way.

So, just how far does
this conspiracy go?

Not sure yet. Teddy's discs
led straight to the buyer...

and he's singing like a canary.

That bitch-ass mother fucker's lucky
I'm not in front of him.

Yeah, well.

He named three hospitals
as his primary customers.

Busy trying to match names with
any records they may have on file.

You know I talked to the chief.

That silly-ass son of a bitch
is fucking ecstatic.

You know what, Captain?
You got a filthy mouth.

I'm working on a recommendation
for you, don't you?

What for? Being mauled twice
or being suspended?

That's all water under
the bridge Ferguson.

You got our man, right?

I don't know how you did it and
I really don't give a shit.

You got our man.

Here is to
Lieutenant Nicholas Ferguson.

I insisted on your promotion.

You're going to be heading up a
newly-formed investigative unit.

And I've been thinking
that maybe you...

Nick?

What's on your mind,
buddy?

I can't do this anymore,
Captain.

I'm outta here.

I'm resigning my commission.

Effective when?

Effective immediately.

You know, this is all you know,
Nick.

What the Hell you think
you're gonna do now?

I don't know.
