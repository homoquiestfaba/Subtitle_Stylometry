<i>We have foot pursuit outside of PNC Park.</i>

<i>3169, here on Stockton Avenue.</i>
<i>Heading down.</i>

<i>438972. Suspect description,</i>
<i>black jacket,Â black pants.</i>

<i>Mayor requests we lock down.</i>
<i>Lock it down on all four corners.</i>

<i>Copy.</i>

<i>Suspect on foot.</i>
<i>I repeat, suspect on foot.</i>

<i>Can we confirm</i>
<i>present location ofÂ suspect?</i>

<i>Got eyes on the suspect. Following.</i>

<i>Dispatch, 3227.</i>
<i>Be advised, suspect isÂ entering PNC Park.</i>

<i>Suspect carrying backpack</i>
<i>moving through PNC.</i>

On the move!

Clear the area!
Get out of my way!

<i>I'm on-site.</i>
Move!

<i>Unit One-Two.</i>
<i>I got your call. Negative.</i>

<i>We have no visual.
We have got no ID at this time.</i>

<i>Suspect is on the roof.</i>

<i>Officers inÂ pursuit.</i>

Ray!

Just come with me, okay?

I'm hereÂ to help.

It's over.

Justâ€¦

It wasn't supposed to be like this.

No, no, no, no!

<i>The past is like a dream.</i>

{\an8}<i>There are memories that shape us,</i>

{\an8}<i>molding us into what we've become.</i>

{\an8}<i>A mosaic of images and feelings</i>

{\an8}<i>that offers some truth
about how we got here,</i>

{\an8}<i>even if details have blurred with time.</i>

{\an8}Sit down.

{\an8}You know this is all yours?

{\an8}Mm.

{\an8}What yaÂ lookin' at, man?

{\an8}I'm lookin' at you, woman.

{\an8}- I love you.
Love you too.

{\an8}<i>As the years pass, we realize</i>

{\an8}<i>we areÂ nothing more
than the experiences thatÂ made us.</i>

{\an8}- Hi, Amanda.
Hi.

{\an8}- Doc.
Mr. Cooper.

{\an8}Is it back?

{\an8}Yes. We'll go over the options,

{\an8}but Infirmam is still the most effective
way to cure this type of cancer.

{\an8}We've already leveraged everything.

{\an8}<i>The pain has brought us closer together.</i>

{\an8}<i>And watching her growâ€¦
has been to find myself again.</i>

Surprise!

Here, mama. This is for you.

I mean, it's not much,
but it's allÂ they had at theÂ gift shop.

Oh.
Her name is Paloma.

No, it's perfect. Thank you, Mom.

<i>But sometimes I wonder,</i>

<i>"Are these </i>my <i>memories,</i>

<i>or are they hers?"</i>

Put your hips into it. Again.

Ooh.
Ooh, that was clean.

Lock that wrist so it don't get weak.
It won't!

There are no rules in a fight,
people do not...

Whoa!
Fight fair!

How do you win an unfair fight?

Ah!

You always fight harder.
That's right.

Let me train her, Coop.
She's got what it takes.

That's my sweet girl.

Done.
Done?

Thank you, baby.

Go on.

{\an8}<i>Parents and their children.</i>

{\an8}<i>Where do weÂ stop and they begin?</i>

Mr. Cooper. Ray.

Doc.
I have good news.

We just got word

a very effective generic version
of Infirmam, called Spero,

is in the final stages of FDA approval.

This is greatÂ news, Ray.

Did you do this?

You did, didn't you?
What?

This was your birthday wish,
wasn't it?

I love you. Let's go tell Mom.

We were supposed to start
a new medication.

You know when that's supposedÂ to happen?

Iâ€¦ You'll have to talk with Dr. Wu.

Dad, what's happening?

Dr. Wu?

Dr. Wu!

Hi, Ray.
What's goin' on?

You said Amanda was
gonna start Spero soon.

I'm sorry.

Amanda's on my list ofÂ patients to see.

The company that makes the generic drug

pulled it off theÂ market.

What are you talkin' about?

BioPrime, the makers of Infirmam,

paid the manufacturer
to delay Spero's release.

Delay?
For how long?

Indefinitely.

Ray.

You told me
that my wifeÂ was gonna be okay.

I am delivering the same news
to threeÂ other patients todayâ€¦

â€¦two of them kids.

I am so sorry.

I'm sorry.

<i>Welcome back.</i>

For those just joining, I'm here
with BioPrime CEO,Â Simon Keeley,

and Congresswoman
Diana Morgan of Pennsylvania.

Congresswoman Morgan,
why are you here today?

<i>Well, I've always taken a hard line
against pharmaceutical lobbies</i>

<i>and massÂ corporations, like BioPrime.</i>

With all due respect, Congresswoman,

BioPrime is unlike any other
pharmaceutical company in the world.

<i>Our scientists have created</i>

<i>the mostÂ effective treatments
in the fight against cancer.</i>

<i>Specifically with Infirmam,
a drug that has increased life expectancy</i>

<i>in 86% of patients treated.</i>

<i>Mr. Keeley, it is notÂ the efficacy
that's in question.</i>

<i>It's the businessÂ practices.
It's the company's businessÂ practices.</i>

<i>I believe that we all
have a basic human right</i>

{\an8}<i>to safe, affordableÂ medication.</i>

{\an8}<i>Yeah. Um, this talking point
of health care as a human right.</i>

<i>Our medicines,
they are a matter of research andÂ science.</i>

{\an8}<i>The investmentÂ is not only risky,
it is extremely expensive.</i>

<i>All right. We have</i>
<i>eager callers that wanna weigh in.</i>

<i>Can you please explain?</i>
<i>Because I just don't understand.</i>

<i>It's crazy that a pillÂ can cost that much.</i>

Yeah, this is, uh, a tricky issue.

Uh, and don't get fooled
by the talking points

ofâ€¦ of politicians fromÂ Washington.

<i>Mr. Keeley,
according to your own internal documents,</i>

<i>the cost of an entire course
of treatment is only four dollars.</i>

You're absolutely right.
Aâ€¦ A course of treatment <i>is </i>four dollars.

But it's funnyÂ how you failed to mention
the billions ofÂ dollarsÂ spent onâ€¦

<i>Your name?</i>
Ray Cooper.

â€¦rebates, discounts,
insurance companies, wholesalers. Look,

{\an8}<i>I'm here because BioPrime</i>

{\an8}<i>is committed toÂ healing the world.</i>

{\an8}<i>And if you look at the numbers,
that is exactly what we'reÂ doing.</i>

{\an8}- <i>That is </i>not <i>what you are doing.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

{\an8}<i>Just to interject,
our next caller is from Pittsburgh.</i>

<i>Ray, do you have something
to say to Mr. Keeley?</i>

My wife is dying in a hospital
because you pulled Spero off the market.

<i>Paying competitors
to shelve genericÂ brands of drugs?</i>

<i>That is immoral, Mr.Â Keeley.</i>

Wellâ€¦

â€¦Rayâ€¦

Is it... Should... Can I?

Uh, I just wanna talk to Ray directly.

<i>Listen.</i>

{\an8}<i>Uh, first of all,
I'd just like to say I'm so sorry</i>

{\an8}<i>to hear about your wife.</i>

<i>Uh, believe it or not,</i>

{\an8}<i>BioPrime is dedicated to </i>savingÂ <i>lives.</i>

Saving lives?
You're geared towardsÂ makin' a profit.

We've already refinanced our house.

I've taken every double shift I can get.

You've already taken everything from me!

<i>Ray,</i>
<i>the sad reality is that cancer</i>

is still very often a death sentence.

<i>Uhâ€¦</i>

<i>In theÂ short term, what would we give?</i>

<i>What is the cost</i>

<i>of spending just a little bit
more time with a loved one?</i>

A year, aâ€¦ a month, a day?

Mmm, it's impossible to put a price on.

If my wife dies,

<i>it's </i>your <i>deathÂ sentence.</i>

I will hunt you down
and killÂ you with my bare hands.

Dad?

What yaÂ lookin' at, man?

I'm lookin' at you, woman.

Oh God!

Oh my God!

Oh, Amanda!

Oh God!

Oh God!

No!

Fuck, no!

Amanda, no!

No!

Bye.

Ah, God damn it.
What? Hospital bill?

Justâ€¦ put it at the bottom of the pile.

We can't ignore it.
Sure you can.

We voted for universal health care. Justâ€¦

Tell 'em we're takingÂ a political stance.

Hmm.

No, we are not eating that
three nightsÂ in a row.

C'mon. You know you love this too.
It's not happening.

We're gonna order
something with vegetables.

Fries do not count.

Hey!
No. Stop.

Ah! Stop ticklin' me.

Stop it.

Hello?
<i>- Ray Cooper?</i>

<i>My name is Martin Bennett.</i>
<i>I'm a journalist for </i>VICE.

<i>I'm doing aÂ story on BioPrime, and
I saw your call with Simon Keeley on TV.</i>

What do you want?

<i>I can help you get justice
for whatÂ happened to your wife.</i>

No, you can't. I've been down that road.

<i>I have proof
that crimes have beenÂ committed.</i>

<i>Crimes that can land
some very powerful people in jail.</i>

Keeley?
Who's that?

<i>Especially Keeley.
We need to talk in person.</i>

You can talk now. Now you have me.
<i>Not over the phone.</i>

<i>Meet me at Gateway Station in 20 minutes.
I won't waste yourÂ time.</i>

Who was that?

I'll be right back.

What do you want?Â Chinese or Subway?

No, it's cool. I'll come with you,
and we can pick it up on the way.

Not gonna happen, Rae.
Sit there and finish that homework.

That's not fair.

Life's not fair.

Chinese?

Lock the door behind me.

I loveÂ you.
Love you.

Excuse me.

Yeah, I'm here. Where are you?

<i>Get on the incoming train.</i>
You were supposed to meet me here.

<i>Trust me, Ray. Just get on the train.</i>

<i>Are you on the train?</i>

Yeah. Now what?
<i>Don't hang up. Just stay on the line.</i>

<i>Just sit tight.</i>

<i>Get off at this station.</i>

Okay, where now?

<i>There's a woman in a striped coat
and a hipster guy with a scarf.</i>

<i>- You see where they're headed?</i>
Yeah. To street level.

<i>All right. There's a guy in a denim jacket
going up the stairs.</i>

<i>I want you to follow that guy.
Hang back, but don't lose him.</i>

<i>Stand by.</i>

<i>Head to the south platform</i>

and take the Red Line
towards Allegheny Station. Okay?

<i>Stay on the line.</i>

Bennett?
Yeah. Martin.

Look, sorry about all this train hopping,
but it's just a precaution.

Okay, honestly,

I'm a little afraid of
how deep this thing might go.

What does that mean?

I got a sourceÂ who told me
about BioPrime's payouts

to multiple offshoreÂ shell corporations.

Bribery, cover-ups,Â who knows what else.
All this leads toÂ Simon Keeley.

There are other players
at both the state and federal level.

But recently, communication went silent.

You told me you had proof.

Enough to tie Keeley to bribes
that pulled Spero off the market.

But without my source,
I can't connect the dots.

You're wastin' my time.

I have enough
to bring public concern against BioPrime,

but I do notÂ have enough
to take them down.

That's whyÂ I need you, your story.

I just...
Look, just think about it.

Look, "Local familyÂ gets ravaged
by Big Pharma's greed."

You gotta help me,Â Ray.

Family, human interest.
That's what grabs headlines.

We can blow this thing wide open.

We canÂ take down BioPrime.
We canÂ bring Simon Keeley to his knees.

Hey!

Dad!

Run!

Hey!

Rachel.

Rachel, baby, are you okay? Look at me.

Just like your dad.

Not about strength.

Okay, top. Top. Up, up, up!

Hands up. Hands up. Move.

Again. Hit him again.
Control him. Let's go.

Come on. You can takeÂ anyone.

Beautiful. There itÂ is.

Nice. Top, top, top, top!
Watch the scramble.

All right.

Hooks in. Get it. Get him in. Here.

Pick your shots.

That's it. Open him up.

You got it. Lock it in.

Beautiful.

Just hold. Hold, hold.

He's tapping, Rachel.

Rachel, he's tapping.

He's tapping, Rachel. Rachel!

Rachel!

Rachel!

Today, I am thrilled
to announce a bipartisan bill

that will make trueÂ progress
in the war to find a cure forÂ cancer.

In collaboration with the CDC andÂ the NIH,

we are creating a strategicÂ partnership

with BioPrimeÂ Pharmaceuticals.

Thanks to the effort
of BioPrime CEO, Simon Keeley,

and chairman,Â Vinod Shah,

this bill will effectively cap
the cost of treatment.

{\an8}<i>Finally, manyÂ of BioPrime's
breakthrough treatments</i>

<i>that used to cost
in the hundreds of thousands of dollars</i>

<i>will now be available
to the public at affordable prices.</i>

<i>I told theÂ American people</i>

<i>that I would hold companies
like BioPrime accountable,</i>

<i>and IÂ have delivered on that promise.</i>

<i>We areÂ cleaning out the rot.</i>

<i>Yes?</i>

<i>Are you planning on running...</i>

Again?

I wasn't watching it. You were.

I had a dream last night

about that trip we took
with Mom in the woods.

My memory's kind of fading of her.

I don't know. It's like I'm losing these
tiny pieces of her every day, and I justâ€¦

I don't know.
I miss her. I miss our family.

Me too.

I miss her too.

What are you planning to do?

I just need to make sense of this.

I needÂ to know.
Justâ€¦ Just leave it alone, okay?

They already investigated,
and they didn't findÂ anything.

Or the guy who tried toÂ kill you.

It just was a dead-endÂ conspiracy.

I don't believe that.

<i>You </i>don't believeÂ that.

I need to try.

Keep it close, Mike.

I don't know how long I'll be.
Yes, sir.

Mr. Keeley.
Ah.

Appreciate it.

Don't let me goÂ dry tonight, will you?

<i>Good evening.</i>

<i>I'm proud to kick off
this first annual event</i>

by introducing youÂ to the CEOÂ of BioPrime,

Mr. Simon Keeley.

Nice to see you, Simon.

Thank you.

Thank you very much. Hello, everyone.

T. S.Â Eliot said,

"We shall notÂ cease in exploration."

We've joined forces
with Goa Capital Partners

in hopes of raising ten million dollarsâ€¦

For... That's right. I know you got it.

Excuse me.

<i>For medicine and assistanceâ€¦</i>

For children in Africa.

India. Sorry.

Either way,
both places need a lot of help.

Thanks again for coming.

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Simon Keeley.

Simon, Simon, Simon.

India, Africa? Africa, India?

Hmm?

You know what?
I am so sickÂ of doing your job for ya.

I'm doing my job, Simon.
Everyone's here because of me.

There's some important people here.

Might want to mingle
with more than yourÂ cocktails.

Sure, all right. Good to see ya.

What the fuck?

Who wouldâ€¦?

Sir?
You kidding? Give me a napkin.

â€¦why I agree to participate
in this bullshit inÂ the first place.

<i>Let's start the auction.</i>
Fucking balls are wet.

It's out of order.
No shit. How'd you figure that out?

Sir. Sir, there's another bathroom
down the stairs.

Well, let's go to it, then. All right?

Wait here. Keep a lookout.

Hey, hey, hey!

Hmm?
What theâ€¦ fuck?

You were warned.

If anything happened toÂ her,
I would hunt you down.

All made her suffer,
but she died because of you.

I didn't kill anyone, you psycho fuck.
Cancer did.

You paid someone to kill Martin Bennett.

What? Martin?
He was investigating your bribes.

What theâ€¦ What are you talking about?
I don't know any Martin Bennett.

You're the goddamn CEO of BioPrime.
All right.

I authorize a bribeÂ now and again,
but it's not like I read the fineÂ print.

Okay, now, stop! Stop!

Fuck!

All right. Uhâ€¦

It must have been Vinod Shah. Okay?

Nothing happens without his sign-off.
He's the one that brought me on, okay?

You have no idea what you're gettingÂ into.

Get him.

Hey!

Here. Handle it. Do it!

Fuck!

No!

Oh shit!

Come here, you little bitch!

<i>Sold! 50,000 dollars.</i>

Rae?

Rachel.

Rachel.

Dad? You're hurt.

I'm fine.Â I need you to pack up.
Only what we need.

When are we coming back?
We're not.

Is that his blood?

Iâ€¦ I had no choice. He had a gun.

I told you not to do this.

People are gonna come after us,
aren't they?

I don't know.

But we need to go.
Please go pack our stuff.

Go pack!

Mr. Asbury,
I'm Special Agent Sarah Meeker.

I already gave a statement.

Your partner,
he took a bullet to the head tonight.

Did you hear any gunshots?

No.

Did you hear anything at all
before losing consciousness?

Somethin' about a woman.

Said, uhâ€¦

"All of them made her suffer."

Orâ€¦ "All made herÂ suffer." I don't know.
What do you mean? All what? All who?

I don't know.
Okay.

Do you remember anything else?
No.

Thank you.

Come on.

But wait.

Whoever it wasÂ said they warned him.

They said they'd come for Mr. Keeley
if anything happened to the woman.

All right. Thank you.

Let's do a check on all death threats
Keeley may have gotten in the past.

You got it.

It's a long drive to Toronto
on theseÂ back roads.

Especially if we're notÂ talking.

Talk to Paloma.

We ran all the Keeley death threats,
and we got a match.

Her name is AmandaÂ Cooper.

Died at Carnegie Medical a fewÂ years back.

Her husband's Oldsmobile
was at the auction.

And we found thisÂ too.

<i>It's impossible to put a price on.</i>

<i>If my wife dies,</i>
<i>it's </i>your <i>death sentence.</i>

<i>I will hunt you down
and kill youÂ with my bare hands.</i>

<i>We're gonna take...</i>
"All made her suffer"?

Right.

Let's put an APB out on Cooper's vehicle.

Here you are.

Got the ID on the driver.

Yeah.

How do you wanna handle this?

Evening.

I'll be right up.

This is Meeker.

<i>You're the agent assigned</i>
<i>to whatÂ happened at the UNICEF fundraiser.</i>

If you have any information,
please callÂ the tip line.

An agent will get back to you.
<i>- Yeah, I called the tip line.</i>

<i>- I told themÂ I'm only talkin' to you.</i>
And who am I speaking to?

<i>Simon Keeley's death was an accident.</i>

<i>- It was self-defense.</i>
How do you know that? Who is this?

I'm gonna tell you
everything thatÂ happened.

If you want a crime, look atâ€¦

look at what Keeley did.

How many cancerÂ patients died
because of him? Thousands?Â More?

Where are you, Rachel?

Goodbye.
<i>Wait, I can help you.</i>

Umâ€¦

My dad doesn't know I'm doing this.

He's a good man.Â Heâ€¦

<i>He just needs help.</i>

Do <i>you </i>need help?

I'm fine.

But I know you think he'sÂ guilty.

You've all made up your minds.

<i>But you're wrong.</i>

<i>He's a good, honestÂ man.</i>

<i>And Iâ€¦ need him.</i>

He's all I got.

Do you have cash?

<i>Why?</i>

When you can, get to aâ€¦
a gas station or a Walmart.

<i>They have disposable phones, a burner.</i>

Okay? You get one, and you call me back.

My number is 412-046-4378.

Okay? No one will be able to trace it.
Okay? It's safe.

<i>Now say it back to me. It's 412-046-4...</i>

Fuck.

Where'd you get that?

Did you stealÂ that?

I'm just looking at it.

It's fine.

What? It's not like
business is booming down there.

Twenty dollars? Seriously?

We're not done.

Look, I know you've always taught me
to do the right thing, okay?

But we're hereÂ because of you.

Hmm?

Rachel, look at me.
Look at me. We gotta go.

Come on.

FBI!

We have permission to gain entry.

FBI!

Meeker.

Whoa. We definitely got our suspect.

It's Torres.

You got something?

What?

Where'd this happen?

Yeah, okay. Thank you.

So, that APB we put out
on Ray Cooper'sÂ vehicle?

It was spotted fleeing the scene

of a double homicide
70 miles north of here.

Rae, I don't think
I can make it toÂ Toronto.

You know those men were sent to kill us.

I had no choice.

I just hate this.

It runs, if you're askin'.

Like an odds-onÂ favorite
at the Kentucky Derby.

You take cash?

We need to stay off the road
until I figure out what's goin' on.

I'm gonna look around.

You wanna come with me?

Huh?

Okay.

I'll be right back.

If they found us at the motel,
they'll find us anywhere.

It's gonna be okay, Rae.
I'm gonna keep you safe.

They're coming to hurt you.

That's why I need to stop this.
It needs to finish.

I have to go after Shah.

You plan on using that?

No, but I need to be ready.

Do you know how to shoot it?
It's not a hunting rifle.

You know I do, Rae.

So, what is your plan?

It's better to have it and not need it
than need it and not have it.

We needÂ protection.

Okay, so all the values
you taught meÂ growing up

are out the window?

As long as we're on the same page, dope.

Shit.

This is Meeker.

<i>There are people</i>
<i>that are coming after us.</i>

Rachel?

I don't know who.
I don't know what he'sÂ gonna do, butâ€¦

<i>Who, your dad?</i>

Look, I've been tryin' to stop him,
but I can't.

The only person
he would ever listen to is my mom.

Can you tell me about her?
<i>- Sheâ€¦</i>

She was a dancer.

She had, uhâ€¦

Tendinitis and stress fractures.

My dad, I mean, he sparred
with guys who couldÂ take a punch.

But you could tell that they were in pain.
You saw it. You know?

But when my mom danced,

she'd just smile.

<i>She always smiled.</i>

She's tough.<i>Â </i>Like you.

You don't know me.

<i>Debate,</i>

gymnastics, judo junior Olympian,

a 3.5 GPA.

You've been checking up on me?

<i>Well, I'm an FBI agent.</i>

I do have oneÂ question.

Who isâ€¦ Paloma?

<i>How do you know about Paloma?</i>

I'm looking at a photo
that says "Rachel andÂ Paloma."

Iâ€¦ wanted a pet.

But we couldn't get one
because of my mom's treatments, soâ€¦

So she got me a stuffed bunny.

Paloma.

<i>Youâ€¦</i>

<i>She was always, uh, looking out for me.</i>

Even when she couldn't.

You'd make her proud.

And your dad.

I don't know what he's gonna do.

Hey. Listen to me.

<i>You </i>are in control.

Um, but I'mâ€¦ I'm not. I'm really not.

<i>- You </i>are <i>in control.</i>
Stop saying that.

You are in control.Â You are RachelÂ Cooper.

Say your name.

Rachel Cooper.
<i>- Say it again.</i>

Rachel Cooper.

That's it.

Turn the ignition on.

Tur...

What are you doin'?

I'm coming with you.

No, you're not.

I'm not leaving you.
This isn't a debate.

You can't do this without me.
I am not putting you in danger, Rae.

This conversation's over.
Get outta the car.

What about the motel?

That was unplanned. Pump the gas.

Promise you'll be back. Promise.

I'll be back.

Pinky swear.

I said,Â I promise.

Get outta the car.

Rae.

You always say
I have to fight harder, soâ€¦

What?

I need you to get outta the car.

Get outta the car.

As long as we're together,
we're still aÂ family.

Okay? So if you can't promise me
that we'll be together,

then I'm comingÂ with you.

Not this time.

Put your seat belt on.

Nice house.

How you gonna get in there?

I'm not.

Dad.

What's this guy doin'?

Look.

Okay. Keep an eye on your sister.
See you at the airport.

Hold on.

This is Victor One. We've got a flatÂ tire.

Stay behind.

What is this?

Something's wrong. Get us out of here.

Forward! Go!Â Go!Â Move, move!

Just break through it! Drive!

Come on! Let's go!

Fuck.

Get me out of here.

Finish him.
Go!

Shit!

Rachel, someone else is here.
Stay in theÂ car.

You're gonna tell me
why MartinÂ Bennett was killed.

There's nowhere to go.
We canÂ get to anyone.

You killed a reporter to cover up bribes.
Who were they paid out to?

Soon, some powerful people
are gonna be looking for a little girl

who lost both her parents.

Daddy!

I know there's others. Who are they?
You don't have what it takes.

Whoa!

Go!

Dad?

Why can't you just listen?

You should'veÂ stayed in the car.

You shouldn't have followed me
to the subway.

That was the man from the subway.

We have to go.

Let's go.

Look.

Hold on.
What are you doing?

Sit down.

If anything goes wrong,
you tell them everything.

Your business with me is done.

Shah's dead.

Hmm. Shah didn't hire me.

My contract isÂ to take out anyone
who can implicate myÂ employer.

Who else are you hunting?

Only the one sitting next to me.

Something for you, darling?

No.

I know your struggle.

I do.

The village IÂ grew up in,

we were farmers.

I worked inÂ the fields with my father.

And one day, aÂ group of rebels came.

They slaughteredÂ my entire village.
Everyone. Whole family, friends.

I was able to hide inÂ the weeds.

Now, you gotta understand,
I was just a kid, know that?

In such pain, with suchâ€¦ rage

that for years, I hunted them one by one.

Then you understand.
I do.

You see, what I've learned in that process

is that there will always be
an opposing force.

No amount of revenge canÂ change that.

So you see, in this case,

you are myÂ village,

and I am the opposing force.

Well, there's three ways this goes down.

One, I tell those cops who weÂ are

and this gets real ugly for both ofÂ us.

Two,

I walk out the front door,

spend the rest of my life hiding
in the four corners of this earth,

and neither ofÂ us get what we want.

Or three,

you tellÂ me who hired you.

We both know I'm gonna go after them.

And when I do,

you can try to take another shot at me.

This way,

at least one of usÂ gets what weÂ want.

Nah.

No, you've killed a few men, butâ€¦

Their deaths are still fresh in your eyes.

You're a dilettante in my world.

I never set out to kill anyone.

Not like you.

You are not innocent.

You knew goingÂ after powerful people
was a dangerous business.

You jumped.

I'm just theÂ pavement closing in.

Diana Morgan.

The person you're lookingÂ for.

The senator.

See you in Pittsburgh.

Rachel.

I'll see ya soon.

Rothman, you have kids.

Does the idea ofÂ Rachel Cooper

being dragged through all of this
bother you at all?

Every case we work has me worried
about my kids one way or another.

I keep thinking about her.

I mean,Â how'sâ€¦

How's a kid supposedÂ to get past
all that she's seen?

I feel likeâ€¦

I feel like I need toÂ protect her somehow.

Just do the work...
Memo came through.

Search crew found Cooper's vehicle.
Where?

In the woods,
20 miles outside Shah's compound.

Looks like local PD got a call
this morning

that a tow truck was stolen
at a nearby location.

We need eyes
on all street cameras on Route 8.

I'm on it.
Thank you.

Okay. Fort Pitt Tunnel.
Only 12 minutes away.

War room.

Hey, guys. We got a hit on that tow truck.
It's headed back to the city.

<i>Suspect is</i>
<i>in a red tow truck. 10-80.</i>

<i>License plate Romeo Tango One Seven</i>

<i>Uniform Alpha Sierra.</i>

<i>We may have something here.</i>
<i>Westbound on Liberty passing 16th.</i>

The chopper! It's on us.

<i>We've got eyes on the suspect.</i>
<i>Making a right turn on 9th.</i>

<i>North on 9th. Picking up speed.
Making a run for it.</i>

All right. Hold on, baby.

Oh shit!

<i>Police! Stop the vehicle now!</i>

Whoa!

Where's the chopper?
It's on your right.Â On your right.

<i>Pull over.</i>

Whoo!
No!

Get outta the way!

Oh shit!

God damn it! Hold on. Hang on!

<i>All units,</i>
<i>suspect is armed andÂ dangerous.</i>

<i>I repeat, armed andÂ dangerous.</i>

The game's letting out.

Oh shit!

<i>Got eyes on the suspect.</i>
On the move!

<i>Suspect on foot.</i>
<i>I repeat, suspect on foot.</i>

<i>Suspect is entering PNC Park.</i>

Hey!

What?

Everybody clear. FBI!
Move! Out of the way!

If he'sÂ down here,
we squeeze him out.

I'll take the upper level.

PPD, cover this level.
The rest, go upstairs.

Suspect spotted.

Suspect spotted on the upper level.

Get me agents to the roof, now!

Move!

I got eyes on.
Copy.

Wait!

Wait.

Okay.

It wasn't rightÂ what happened to you.
I understand that.

Look, no one is gonna hurt you.

It's me. I'm here to help.

Okay?

I don't know you.

Yes, you do. We'veâ€¦

We've been talking.

No. Paloma.

You told me
your stuffed bunny's name was Paloma.

Remember?

It wasn't supposed to be like this.

Your father was a good man.

<i>You are notÂ him.</i>

<i>Say your name.</i>

<i>You are in control.</i>

Fuck.

You're nothing but a scared little...

Rachel.

I'll see ya soon.

Say your name.

<i>Rachel.</i>

We're gonna be okay.

He shouldn't have been killed.

Come on, justâ€¦ sayâ€¦ your name.

Just say your name!

Rachel Cooper.

Yeah.

<i>We have</i>
<i>a positive identification of the suspect.</i>

<i>Her name is Rachel Cooper.</i>

No. No, no, no, Rachel!

<i>Her name is Rachel Cooper.</i>

<i>Eighteen years of age.</i>

<i>Any family to contact?</i>

<i>Both parents deceased.</i>

Okay, calm down!

Fuck!

No!

Rachel, stop!

There you are.

I'm scared.

I feel like the whole world's gone crazy.

Or maybe it's just me.

I'm tired.

Nobody cares about stoppingÂ them.

Besides me.

Will I ever get to see you and Mom again?

We're with you now.

The fight begins here.

Big business andÂ corporate interests

have corroded ourÂ politics.

And I believe that our country
is on the verge of imploding.

Of rotting.

Rotting from the inside out.

We needÂ someone who will cleanâ€¦

â€¦out the rot!

Clean out the rot!

Today, I am announcing my bid

to be yourÂ next senator

from the great state ofÂ Pennsylvania.

That's right.

And to big business politics,

we haveÂ one thing to say.

This is our state,

andÂ it is not for sale!

Well done.

Entering the race isÂ just the beginning.

Let's focus on what we wanna do
when we win.

<i>Where'd you get this?</i>

It's Mom's.

Actually, it's mine.

<i>I tookÂ your mom to a Steelers game
shortly afterÂ we met,</i>

and it was freezing,
and I gaveÂ her my jacket.

And she never gave itÂ back.

Well, now it's my turn
to steal it from her.

Hmm.

<i>It's my turn to steal it from her.</i>

<i>Come on, baby.</i>

<i>Get up.</i>

<i>Get up, sweet girl.</i>

Calling the FBI.

And when they getÂ here,

you're gonna tell them
everything you did with BioPrime.

Go ahead.Â Or better yet, let me.

I thinkÂ the FBIÂ is looking for <i>you,</i>

Rachel.

You know me?

You're all over the news.

I've seen whatÂ you did.

You bring the FBI here, andâ€¦

Who do you think they're gonna arrest?

The crazy girl who killed five men?
No.

Or me?
No. We never meant to hurt anyone.

I understand, and I can help you.

I think I'mÂ the only one who can.

I can make thisÂ nightmare end.
Shut up!

You're the one behind BioPrime.
I wrestled them into submission.

I gotÂ them to lower their prices.
Affordable treatment.

And you cleaned out the rot.

I'm fighting for <i>you,</i> sweetheart.

When I saw you on CNN
when my mom was in the hospital,

I thought you could actually save her.

I believed in you.

You still can.
How?

I know people at the DOJ.

They can makeÂ the charges
against youÂ go away.

And you can have a life.

What you've beenÂ through,
what happened to you, wasÂ wrong,Â Rachel.

The trauma you suffered.

Don't you think they'd want me
to help you,Â sweetheart?

Stop calling me that.

You're a liar.

You were with BioPrime even then.

You helpedÂ them take away

a cheap and lifesaving
medication for my mom.

I fought against them!

You took their bribe,
and you gave themÂ exclusive contracts.

<i>You're </i>responsible
for ordering the hit on Martin Bennett.

You killed my dad.

Now tell the truth.

Tell me the truth.

Yeah.

I took the bribe.

I ordered the hit.

You don't understand anything.
You're so young.

The candidate with the most money wins.

That's how it works.

Was it worth it?

Was it worth it?

Security?

Security!

She kills Keeley and runs.
Tries to escape, but something or someone

drove her back here,
despite knowing she might beÂ caught.

Yeah, but she got
her revenge. Why come back?

Just came in.
Thank you, sir.

You're welcome.

Holy shit.
What?

<i>Rachel Cooper was spotted</i>

<i>at Diana Morgan's campaign rally
yesterday afternoon.</i>

<i>What was she doing there?</i>

<i>The fugitive</i>
<i>from last night's assassination attempt</i>â€¦

Thanks.

<i>â€¦on Diana Morgan is still on the loose.</i>

<i>Pittsburgh police are asking
anyone with information</i>

<i>to please come forward.</i>

<i>First Keeley,</i>
<i>then Shah, now aÂ congresswoman?</i>

<i>It just seems so bizarre.</i>

<i>Rachel clearly knows something.</i>

<i>Let's go through Diana Morgan's
campaign donations.</i>

Look at this.
Rachel Cooper just sent us something.

<i>I took the bribe. I ordered the hit.</i>

<i>The candidate with the most money wins.</i>

<i>That's how it works.</i>

<i>â€¦developments</i>
<i>in the assassination attempt.</i>

<i>According to sources,
the FBI hasÂ arrested the congresswoman</i>

<i>regarding herÂ connection</i>

<i>to the recent murders
of BioPrime executives</i>

<i>Simon Keeley andÂ Vinod Shah</i>

<i>and the two-year-old unsolvedÂ murders
of Martin BennettÂ and Ray Cooper.</i>

<i>Neither BioPrime or the FBI would
comment on this ongoing investigation.</i>

<i>â€¦Pennsylvania is allegedlyÂ connected
to the deathsÂ of reporter Martin Bennett</i>

<i>and RachelÂ Cooper's father
nearly two years ago.</i>

<i>The past is like a dream.</i>

<i>A mosaic of images and feelings</i>

<i>that offers someÂ truth
about how we got here,</i>

<i>even ifÂ details have blurred with time.</i>

<i>Parents and their children.</i>

<i>Where do we stopâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦and they begin?</i>
