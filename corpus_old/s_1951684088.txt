You`ll have to attempt an
one hour parenting class.

It was all his idea!
He`s out of control, I tell you!

I met my wet sand.

See you in court kid.

Ok son.
Lets get some lunch.

Did you al least bring my cloths?
Shirt, Socks, Everything you need.

You didn`t bring my pants!

Who am i?
"Tommy Bahama"?

This is the worst day of my life.

This is the worst day of
your life so far..

Say Bart..
What do you want Flanders?

If you need pants,
I carry an extra pair.

I mean..

You know how boys are always,
"Praying through the knees".

Why are you helping me?
Im not your kid.

We`re neighbors.

Im sure your father will do
the same for my boys.

Thank you!

Hey, Whats with you?
You realy wanna know?

Of course i do. What kind of a
father wouldn`t care about a..

A pig wearing a hat!

Action!

Hey! Hey!
Its your old pal Krusty!

For my new pork sandwich:
"The Klager".

If you can find a greasyer sandwich..
You`re in Mexico!

And we`re clear.

Perfect. Cut, Print, Kill the pig.

What? You cant kill him if
he`s wearing people cloth.

You`re coming home with me.

A thousand eyes.

What chould that be?

Im pretty sure a thousand..

Is a number.

Hey Marge!

Isn`t it great been marriage to
someone who`s recklessly impulsive?

Actually its aged me horribly.

Then, Say hello to the new Simpson!

Homer!

I believe what happened in church
was a warning about precisely this.

Please get rid of that pig.

Oh. You`re gonna love him!

Look, He dose an
impersonation of you.

You nailed her.

He also dose me..

You smiled im off the hook.

Oh, You have so many looks.

So, Thats what sanguine is.

Who`s a good pig?

Who`s a good pig??

Ruff day ha, San?

You dont know what
ruff is, Sister.

Bart, You know, When ever my
boys bake up a bunch of frownies.

I take`em fishing.

Dose your dad ever
take you fishing?

Dad, Its not fair to use a
"Bug Zapper" to catch the fish.

If you like fish like i do,
You want them to die with dignity.

I think i have a nibble.

I think fishing might
be more fun with you.

Oh Great!

Now, How about i`ll
fix you some coco?

No way!
Coco is for woosys.

Well sir, If you change your
mind its on the window sill.

Oh my god..

Oh wait, I didnt tell
you the best part.

He loves the invairment.

Oh wait, I still didnt
tell you the best part.

He`s got an Irish brogue.

No, No, No. Wait, Wait! I still
didnt tell you the best part.

He is not imaginary!
Oh honey thats great.

But the very best thing
is that he listens to you.

Because nothing means
more than for a man to...

How did the big`s tracks
get on the ceiling?

Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig.
Dose what ever Spider-Pig dose.

Can he swing,

From a web?

No he cant, He`s a pig.

Lookout..! He is a Spider-Pig.

Are we having fun yet?
We are now.

You got a bite.
Woow momma!

Oh no, My good Paul!

You are not struggling me.
What the..?

Struggling is only good for..

Well, Its not realy
good for anything.

I think the only time you
should lay hands on a boy.

Is when you`re giving him a
good old peed on the back.

Hey, What the hell are you..?

One more time.

Honey, Im home!

We are at the tipping
point, People.

If we dont do
something now..

Im sorry i lost my
train of thought.

Isn`t he dreamy?
Agreed!

Ok. So here is the bottom line:
If we dont change our ways right now,

Pollution in lake Springfield
will be at this level.

Thats not so bad.

No, The lift is stuck.

Am i getting through to anyone?

Hell yeah! We need a new
one of those things.

All in favor of the
new ceasing lift, Say: I.

I!

No!

This lake is just one piece of trash
away from a toxic nightmare!

But i knew you wouldn`t listen so i took
the liberty of putting water from the lake

in all your drinking classes.

This is why we should
hate kids.

This is serious People.
No more dumping in the lake!

I here by declare a
state of emergency.

"Code Black".

Black?

Its the wrost color there is.

No offence there Carl.
I get it all the time.

Sorry, Sorry.
No dumping in the lake.

Fine. I will put my "Yard Trimmings"
in a car compactor.

Chief i think there was a
dead body in there.

I thought that too..
Until he said "Yard Trimmings".

You gotta learn to
listen, You know?

Let us now make sure this
barrier is completely idiot proof.

Cletus!
Yes sir.

Try to dump something in the lake.

Ok.

I cant.
I simply cant.

Very effective.

Dont get any ideas..

Maybe we should kiss?
Just to break the tension.

Whats going on here?
Nothing, Nothing.

Im not sure that pig
should be in the house.

And by the way,
Waht are you doing with his..?

Leavings.

Dont worry i divide the
most elegant solution.

Oh its leaking!
Its not leaking..

Its over flowing.

You filled up the whole
silo in just 2 days?

Well i helped.

Homer stop! Stop, I know its easy
for your mind to wonder...

I want you to realy
concentrate on me.

I cant escape the feeling that this is
the crisis grandpa warned us about.

You have to dispose of
that waste properly.

Ok Marge.
I will.

You can take Spider-Pig with you.

He`s not Spider-Pig anymore.
He`s "Harry Ploper".

Homer.
You gotta get over here.

Donuts inspectors juse shout down the store.
They`re starting to giving up free donuts.

Oh my god, Oh my god,
Oh my god!

I just got one thing
i gotta do first.

Alright, You better hurry.
They`re going fast.

Wow, That was close.

Evil!

Drive, Drive, Drive!

Oh, Right.

Look at that. You can see the 4
states are border Springfield.

Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky.

Oh yeah.
And if you look real close you can almost..

Well, This certainly seems odd but..

Who am i to question the
work of the all mighty?

We thank you lord, For this
mighty fine intelligent design.

Good job!

Jebi, Jebi.
Jeb, Jeb, Jeb.

Hey, Jeb. One more eye
and its a federal crime.

Who are you?
Environmental Protection Agency.

Russ Cargill. Head of the EPA.
Here to see the president.

Mr. president.
Yeah, That is me.

Pollution in Springfield has
reached crisis levels.

I hate this job.

Everything is: Crisis this and
the end of the world that.

Nobody opens with a joke.
I miss Danny DeVito.

You wanna joke, Ha?

Stop me if you`ve
heard this one.

Look at those angry eyes
and those giant teeth.

Its like christmas at
the Kennedy compound.

Well sir. When you made
me head of the EPA.

You were apploted for appointing one
of the most secsesful men in america.

To the the least secsesful
agency in government.

And why did i take the job?

Because im a rich man who
wanted to give something back.

Not the money, But something.

So here is our chance to kick
some ass for mother earth.

Im listening.

Well, I`ve managed your choices
down to 5 unthinkable options.

Each will cause untold misery..
I pick number 3!

You dont even want to
read them first?

I was elected to lead,

Not to read.

Number 3!

We`re been sealed in a dome.

What do i do?
I dont know what to do.

If i`ll stay im trapped
if i`ll leave im alone!

Oh god!
In, Out, In, Out.

I never saw Venus.

EPA! EPA!

Trapped forever.

Its all come true.

That crazy old man
in church was right!

Doooooooooooome!

Alright man, Open fire!

Who`is heart?
Raise your hands.

Without the attitude.

People, People. I have an
important announcement!

I have just perfected an acid fireing
super drill, Which can cut through anything.

<i>Yeah he is cool!</i>

Its right there,
Just outside of the dome..

What roffless mad man
chould have done this to us?

The United States Government.

My name is Russ Cargill
and im head of the EPA.

The what?
Environmental Protection Agency.

Come again.
Look im a man on a big tv.

Just listen!

Springfield has become..
Woow Springfield!

..The most polluted city in
the history of the planet.

Drama queen!

To prevent your poison
from spreading,

Your government had sealed
you all within this dome.

Believe me its the last
thing we wanted to do.

I do own the company that makes
the dome but that's a bisides of that.

What? You`re telling us
we trapped like rats?

No. Rats cant be
trapped this easily.

You`re trapped like.. Carrots.

Wait, Wait! We chouldn`t
be more polluted.

Everyone stopped
dumping in the lake.

Apperntly someone
didn`t get the message.

Act natural.

Hey buddy, Sooner or later people
are gonna come by and discover this!

Dont worry about that. We found
a way to take you off the map.

<i>Coming up on your right..</i>

<i>Nothing.</i>

This is Kent Brockman reporting to you,

On a crisis so sirius it has its
own name and theme music.

The dome is putting end
to life as we know it.

The town is runing low on supplies
of everything from gasoline to botox.

Moment please.

Now, As always,

We end our news
on the lighter side.

Its the time of year when the
swallows return to springfield.

I think the thing i miss most,

Is a simple summer breeze.

Maggie?!

<i>We got: Dome wax,
Dome polish, Dome freshener.</i>

<i>All your dome needs and dome people. Loacted
at intersection 105 freeway. And the dome.</i>

<i>"Dome Depot".</i>

Maggie got out!
Maggie got out!

Maggie was right there.
Just out side the dome.

Marge, She`s right here.

This dome can play tricks on you.
You just have to keep calm and..

Oh my god!
Im out of the dome!

Fresh air! Freedom!

I`ll write`ya!
Live good lives!

<i>Good evening this is
Kent Brockman.</i>

Efforts to find out who`s selfish
crime against the environment,

Caused our entrapment
have been fruitless.

Antil moments ago!

A shocking discovery has been
made here at lake Springfield.

Ah, It can be
anybody's pig crap silo.

Homer, It was you!

You single handedly
killed this town!

I know, Its weird.

Just a reminder: This station dose
not indoor visualistics justice.

Unless it gets results.

Which it will.

You didn`t listen to me
after i warned you?

Dont worry. Nobody`s
watches this stupid show.

Whats that amuness
glow in the distance?

Kill! Kill! Kill!

Marge, Look. Those idiots
dont even know where we live!

Kill! Kill! Kill!

We want Homer!
We want Homer!

Monster! You monster!!

Did you see the news?
Honey come on, We have bigger broblems.

But im so angry!

You`re a woman.
You can hold on to it forever.

Ok.

Homer, You have to go
out there. Face that mob,

And apologize for what you did.
I would,

Im afraid if i`ll open the
door they will take all of you.

<i>No we wont!
We just want Homer!</i>

Well, Maybe not you.
But they will kill grandpa!

<i>Im Part of the mob!</i>

Teeny, Takeout the baby.

Here, Let me get that for you.

Stay back i got a chainsaw!

Bart, Crawl across hurry!

But if they`ll see trying
to help us they will kill you.

Oh shot. Im sure your
father will do the same for..

Oh im thinking,
Now  hassle your basel's!

Archers!

Im using an red arrow,
So i know who i kill.

No, Ploper!

If you`ll push that,
Daddy will die.

Hey, My luck`s beginning to turn!

Wait, There`s
something i have to get!

What did you get?
Our wedding video.

We have a wedding video?

<i>Torch his gas tank!</i>

We`re lost them!

Uh, Up here!

<i>Get them! Get them!</i>

Ah, Little help?

You know, The word "Apology"
is toast around a lot these days.

But when it comes for man hear..

Mom, What are we gonna do?

Maggie, Not now!

We`ll play later!

A sinkhole.

Follow me kids!

Jeronimo!
Saint Julia!

So long, Lossers!

The top of his head is
still showing. Claw on it!

Well, They`re
China`s problem now.

Colin!

I cant hear you!

I never thought my life would have an
absolutely perfect moment. But this..

Lisa got a boyfriend,
That she`ll never see again!

Perfect.

What do we do?

Now, We run.

Im afraid we lost them sir.

Well than, You`ll find them. And
you`ll get them back in the dome!

And you make sure
nobody else gets out.

I want roving gas squads
around the perimeter 24/7.

I want 10,000 tough guys,

And i want 10,000 soft guys,

To make the tough
guys look tougher.

And here is how i want
them arranged:

Tough, Tough, Soft, Tough,

Soft, Soft, Tough, Tough,

Soft, Soft, Tough, Soft.

Sir, Im afraid you`re
going mad with power.

Of course i have, You ever
tried to go mad with out power?

Its boring,
No one listens to you.

Bart, Are you drinking Whisky?
Im troubled.

Bart!
I promise, I`ll stop tomorrow.

You`ll stop right now!

Come back here, Little man!

I miss Flanders,
There i said it!

Where`s your father?
He went out.

Lets quickly rebulid our
life`s, When he`s gone.

Hey guys, Whats the
secret knock, Again?

Look i know i screwed up,
This is big.

Its huge, We`re homeless,
Our friends wanna kill us.

Before we can even stay
in the same room with you,

I need to know what was going through
your mind, When you didn`t listen to me?

And dumped that silo in the lake.

Homer!

I dont know what to tell you Marge,
I dont think about things.

I respect people who do,
But..

I just try to make
the day`s not hurting,

Until i get to crawling
next to you again.

Oh...

I mean, OH!

Look, Im realy sorry.
But im more than just sorry.

Im prepared with a solution.

I`ve always been afraid that i`ll screw up
our life`s so badly, That we need a backup plan.

And that plan is right here!

No..

Nop.

Bingo!

Stay with me.

Alaska?

Alaska, A place where you
cant be too fat or too drunk.

Where no one`s say`s things like: Lets

I dont know Homi.
Oh, Im not saying it right.

Look, The thing is i cant
start a new life alone.

And i really come to like you guys.

I just dont see it.

Marge, In every marriage
you get one chance to say,

"I need you to do this with me".

And there is only one
answer one somebody says that..

Ok Hommi, Im with you.

Thank you my sweetheart.

Mom.
Yes honey?

You just bought another load of crap,
From the world`s fatest fertilizer salesman.

You`ll pay for ruining this
golden family moment!

Hommer!

How we suppose to get to
alaska with out any money?

Alright son. If you dont believe
in me, Believe in America!

America, Where any men
can make quick money,

With no questions asked.

<i>Lift that up and win my truck!</i>

<i>All you have to do is conquer
"The Ball of Death".</i>

What`s the catch?
No catch.

Just ride the motorcycle all
the way around just one time.

3 Tries for 10$.

Marge, How much
money do we have?

10$.

That counts as a try.

<i>Thats two.</i>

<i>And thats three.</i>

Tell you what im gonna do,

Just cause i like to seen
you hurt yourself.

I`ll give you one
"On the House".

You are the best.

Dont slow down, Speed up!

But thats where its the scariest!
Just do it!

<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

I`ll take that truck now.

The hospitol`s generator is about

Lifes, Lost.

Go on.

We got convict, We`re gonna

Tempting, Tempting..

Look all our reasons

First door on the right.
Thank you!

What? This isn`t the way i

Oh, Thats better.
Homer!

Well, At least my
poster didn`t get turn.

Welcome to Alaska!
Here`s a 1000$.

Well, Its about time..
But, Way?

We pay every resident a 1000$,

To allowed the oil companies to ravage
our state's natural beauty.

Im home!
-Oh thanks.

What are you doing Bart?
Just passing the time.

Oh, My boy loves Alaska so
much he`s applauding it.

Lisa, Why aren`t you claping?
But dad..

Clap for Alaska!

Well Marge, We`re separated
from the kids by a wall of snow.

All my dreams are coming true.

Day 93 under the dome.

With an accessity growing
dangerously low,

Who knows what spark will set
off this powder cage.

Ok, Lets discuss
Tuesdays with Mori.

Again? If we dont get a
new book im going to poke.

You`re the five people im
gonna meet in hell!

We`re out of coffee!

<i>I cant take another
minute in this dome!</i>

Take that!

Oh no, Blowback!

Look what they`re
doing to our dome.

You know what that is sir?
A crack?

Exactly.

First let me stick the problem:
People got out of the dome before,

They`re gonna get out again.

And when they do, There`re
gonna be hearing, Investigations..

"Gotten himmel"! I`ll have to go
back making family comedies.

Dont worry i have a solution for you
sir, Infact i have 5 solutions.

You dont even have to read them,
You`ll have the liability.

I`ll take care of everything.
You know nothing.

No!
I need to know what im approving.

Absolutely. But on the other hand,
Knowing things is over rated.

Anyone can pick something
when they know what it is..

I takes real leadership to pick
something you`re clueless about.

Ok, I pick 3.
Try again.

One.
Go higher.

5.
Too high.

3?
You already said 3.

6?
There is no 6.

2?
Double it.

4!
As you wish sir.

Are you tired of the
same old "Grand Kenion"?

Here we are kids,
The "Grand Kenion".

Its so old and boring.
I want a new one, Now!

Hello! Im Tom Hanks.

The U.S Government has lost its credibility,
So its borrowing some of mine.

Tassel my hair, Mr. Hanks.
Sure thing, Son.

Now, Im pleased to tell you all
about the new "Grand Kenion".

Coming this weekend!

Its east of shabby ville and
south of capital city.

Thats where Springfield is!

Its no where near where
anything is or ever was.

This is Tom Hanks saying:
If you`re going to pick,

A government to trust,
Why not this one?

Did you see that?

Yes, They`re going
to destroy Springfield!

But, We`re going to stop them.

Hommi, Get your cloths on!

Hommi?
Im happy here, Screw Springfield!

I cant believe you`d say
somthing so selfish.

Marge, Those people chased
us with pitchforks and torchs.

Torchs! At 4 in the afternoon!
Its was 7 at night.

It was during "Access Hollywood".

Which is on at 4 and 7.

Dad, How can you turn your back
on everyone who`d loved us?

Flanders helped us when
we were in trouble.

Who cares what Flanders did?
He`s not your father.

I wish he was.

You dont mean that,
You`re worship me.

Oh yeah? Look what i

Homer, In every marriage you
get one chance to say,

"I need you to do this with me".

That is the stupidest
thing i have ever heard.

Homer Simpson!
-We`re saving Springfield!

Listen to me all of you!
We are staying!

We have great life here in Alaska and we
are never going back to America again!

<i>I have spoken!</i>

Well, I guess I`ve let them
worry about me long enough.

Marge? Kids?

Ok, Here it goes.

Homer, I`ve always stood up for you,
When people point out thier flaws,

I always say: Well sometimes you have to
stand packed to appropriate a work of art.

Way back.

Lately, What keeping us together,

Is my ability to overlook
everything you do.

And i overlooked this things because..
Because?

Well thats the thing. I just dont know
how to finish that sentence anymore.

So, Im leaving with the kids
to help Springfield.

And we`re never coming back.

And to prove to myself
that this is the end..

I taped this over our wedding video.

Goodbye Hommi.

I love you!

Marge? Kids?

So, Mom, Whats our plan?
What are you doing up there?

Looking through people`s luggage..

I am the mascot of
an evil corporation.

Get down from there!
We have to keep a law profile.

Till we get to Seattle to tell the world of
the plot to destroy Springfield.

I dont know if you guys
should be talking so loud.

No, Lisa, Its not like the government
is listening to everybody`s conversion.

<i>Hey im calling about

<i>you hang up first. No,
You hang up first. Ok.</i>

The government actually found
someone we`re lokking for!

<i>Homer Simpson.</i>

Do you know why you are here?

Cause my family cares more about
other people than they do about me.

By the ancient inuit art
of throat singing.

Throat singing?

How long are we doing this?
Until you have an epiphany!

Ok.

Whats an epiphany?

Sudden realization of great truth.

<i>Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig.</i>

Bananas are an excellent
source of potassium.

Americans will never embrace soccer?

More than 2 shakes and its
playing with youself?

Hey, What are you doing?

Alright, Do what ever you want to me.
I dont care about myself anymore.

Without them, Im nothing.

Inorder to save myself,

Hey Flanders.
Bart, How good to see ya!

And how terrible you`re here.
Thanks.

Listen, I was just wondering if..

Before i died, I could
pretend i had a father who..

Cared for me.

Come here son. There is always room
for one more in the Flanders clan.

Come one bomb disarming robot,
You`re our last hope!

Red wire, Blue wire.
Black is usually the ground.

So much pressure..

But i didn`t take him seariously.

Here, Buy yourself something nice.

Homer, What the hell

Risking my life to save people i hate
for reasons i dont quite understand.

Gotta go!

First, One stop.

Bart, Son?

You think you can find it in your heart to
give you foolish old man one more chance?

I dont know..

Its seems to me, Sonny.

Your father said that he wants to
spend his last minute with you.

No, I cant do it!

I want a father who`s the same
in the morning as he is at night.

Whats that word?
 Consistency!

Thanks loosers.

Sorry Homer!

I`ll let you hold the bomb.

The man knows me..

I wish Homer was my Father.

Well, I wish you didnt have
the devil`s curly hair.

I`ve been taking your crap, All my life!

Oh, This feels good.
No wonder you do it.

Ok, Bart. You`ve only got one shot to
throw this bomb through the hole!

Dad, In case i miss, Im sorry i said
i wished you weren`t my father.

I dont blame you son,
I wasn`t much of a father.

Maybe it start in the
way my dad raised me.

Yes, Its clear to me.

Its just been one long and broken cycle..
Somebody throw the godamn bomb!

What..
Whats going on?

No, No, No, No!

Ah, Dad?

Its amazing no one was hurt.

Bye, Everybody.

Now, That was a great
father son activity.

Hello. Homer.

So, We meet at last,
Who ever you are..

There`s a couple of things they dont
teach you out at "Harvard" business school.

One: Is how to coap with defeat.
The other is how to handle a shotgun.

Wait, If you`ll kill my dad, You`ll never
know where the treasure is buried.

Smithers, I dont believe in suicide, But if you`d

Come on dad, Lets go! I`ve been holding it
since they put the dome over the town.

You can wait. Alot of people work realy hard on this
