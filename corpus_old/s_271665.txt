You have a long time with the Company
Delta. A whole life, Charlie.

17 missions in América Central,

6 in the Medium East.

4 in the Asian Southeast

A true turn to the World.

A perfect record, from
the first day of training.

The perfect Soldier.

"The works are always clean",
it is that that you/they say your superiors.

Any committed mission
in your register.

You know the cost to workout, to equip
and to maintain a soldier like you?

756.000 dollars, Charlie.

It is a work life
for some people in this Country.

You were the defense and the support of thousands
that not even they know you.

We have in itself a great investment.

For where wants to begin?

For the beginning.

Good, I was born at a small town...
No that I begin.

It is important that he/she understands because
he/she is here, Lieutenant.

Does he/she understand reason, not?

I have faith that the word correcta
it is "interrogation"

And that more has faith?

That in the it equips Delta don't like
of the ones that they resign.

Because we didn't begin
for the I begin?

Me and the auxiliary shooter Curtis Bantree...

it was attributed us a mission
to assure an area...

where would have room a sale
of foreign weapons

ZEBISTAN, CLOSE TO TURKEY
TWO MONTHS BEFORE

We had pictures of satellite of the place.

We arrived thirty six hours
before the sale.

We had aerial support
of a helicopter...

and one equips in earth,
infiltrated in the sale...

two men and a woman.

Our work was to observe and to protect.

Supposedly, it was a routine work.

But he/she didn't leave how we waited.

What needs at this time
it is a big and cold mug of beer.

It will be the first thing that I will do
as soon as this finishes.

To hold on to an enormous piece
of ham "New York."

To light the old barbecue with firewood
own to burn, of the original.

You knew that the best place to find
is firewood to burn in New Mexico?

New Mexico.

Well, there is nothing nor nobody there in low.

We are already here at the 34 hours, Charlie.

You think the pictures of Satellite
were correctas?

Yes.

I don't see any sale of
missiles stolen for here.

They are there, only with the salesperson.

I don't see nothing else than powder.
But that know me.

Are you to think in giving up?

Sometimes.

Maybe get one of those works
stupid of office...

with a secretary and a computer.

Oh no, no, no, not.
Men like us...

we are not office men,
we are not friends of the office.

You perfectly know.

The old ones veteran they say:
“never leave the work...

it doesn't import him/it all try to flee.”

Such time could be the first.

I already lost some things
in this whole time, Curtis.

Is your wife, not?

You know Charlie, he/she is always the wife,
he/she believes, I know.

Attention, ours arrived equips.

Charlie, I see two hidden,
to 274 meters of here...

to northwest of the slope of that hill.

Understood.

It is here.

There is somebody that listens to me.

Ready and to the wait.

There are two hidden behind you,
in the rocks the about 37 meters.

Ahead with the operation.

It is there the bad come.

Do you bring the money?

Yes, I have him/it here.

He/she shows him/it.

That seems to be the leader.

He/she is complete.

Do you want to see the merchandise?

I can count four ugly.

Understood.

Shit, she is of ours equips.
They have one of ours, Charlie.

The combat procedure is always
to kill the Officials first.

He/she is later the soldiers,
that knows me very well.

But this time was different.

Who decided that you didn't proceed
the due procedure?

I felt that the feminine member
he/she could be committed.

Was anybody to think to kill her?

Not on that moment.

It is then as it was that it determined
what was she in danger?

That is my quality.

This is badly, Charlie.
They are to mistreat the girl.

It is a shit.

Distance?

155 meters.

What devil is been to pass?

Shit

Charlie!

This is badly,
this is badly! Charlie.

Officials first, ok?
He/she makes him/it already...

Officials first,
what devils...?

My brother!

Of where see the shots?

I waited for a long time!

Anything of that is your fault, Charlie.

They knew the risk about working infiltrated.

There, on top of that mountain.

Shoot.

"Angry A", "Angry A"... "Red Fox"
I need immediate transport home.

We are going in Charlie!

"Red fox", "Red Fox",

for killing.

And it went home!

Correcto.

Bantree and me regressámos the
Los Angeles.

Where does his/her wife live?

No.
We are separated

Lament.

What tells us respect, it is what happened
after the return.

You know what happened.

Say-millstone in their own words.

I returned to Los Angeles...

and it took me about two days
to contact my wife and children.

It is later notified my superiors
that he/she would give up the position.

Park MacArthur
Los Angeles.

Ei! My music is not free, did you know?

Stupid!

Do you think I make this for my health?

Thank you very much and that God blesses you.
To you also.

Dad!

Hello, my princess.
You are very well.

Dad, Sam said that it doesn't go
to take the small-lunch...

I told him/her that he/she has,
it is not true?

What does happen he/she?

Today I don't want to go.

But reason?

But you don't have to go,
we only go you and me.

Hello!
Hello!

asking for you.

He/she tells them please, that not

He/she is well.

You didn't tell them anything, you no longer

Yes, he/she already told them, but I suppose

I thought that of course
we would respect our space...

during the separation period.

I am to try.

How is it going the work?

Well, thank you.
He/she hears, I have to go...

No so much, my love.

It goes and it takes your backpack, your father

He/she is well.

He/she never knew when you would return, Charlie...

and I learned not caring,
but the children...

There is one week behind,
Sam watched a war film…

I woke up ace three of the morning and him
he/she was in my bed, to cry...

and to say that you no longer you would return.

But I returned.

And for how long?

One week, maybe two.

I don't know.

Will you give up again?
the last lasted two weeks.

He/she hears Maggie, please.
All have decisions to take,

and this, you already took her.

No Charlie,

We will eat wheat pancakes.

Wheat pancakes!
Yes.

Who wanted to order you?

Only a coffee.

Oh yes, did you have a bad night?

He/she gives me only a coffee, Maysie.

Right.

Sam is depressed.

No, I am not.

Is there some problem, Sam?

It is that I don't want that my dad
go again.

He/she has to work,
it is not true?

Are you well?

Small-lunch with me tomorrow?
Clear, without lack.

He/she was to think that this weekend
could we go to the coast, that you/they find?

Also with the mammy?

I don't know, it can be that the mammy

I know boys, I know...

Already in I want him/it you to go again.
Sam are not rude, somebody can see us.

He/she gives me a kiss.

That is my place.
Leave.

Do excuse?

Disappear.

Forgive his/her majesty.

He/she is going you.

He/she is not to work.

No, I was awaiting 15 to 20 minutes...

I was so much hungry that I had

Please, let to help me her.

You you are Snow, it is not true?

Yes.

My God, I am friend of the

How? With Sam and Lisa?

Yes, something happened.
What did happen?

Look, park his/her car and come with me,
my car is there, we are going in him.

It puts you in the car.
We go, we go...

You made a mistake in the person.
It shuts up and he/she will run everything well.

You cannot crawl for the streets
like this without further ado.

That is America,
this happens everyday.

The hunt is to begin, my friends.

Vain.

The bear is in movement.

For the time being we have the mammy Ursa and
fast we will have the small bears also.

That will do with that the dad Bear
come to have connosco.

And he/she reminds you, this is a city
very big and our Bear...

he/she has friends that we cannot see.

We have to check that no the
find until that the hunt finishes.

How is our "Ursita?"

"Ursita" is ready.

He/she is well Charlie, now the game
he/she comes to your own patio.

Hut of Curtis Bantree.

Hello beauty!

Where do you go?

He/she carries you well, be a good dog.
Will you be to take care of the Fort?

Do you want him to swallow you a steak with bone?

I adore you.

A steak and we will make a barbecue.

Where do you go?

You cannot come, you have to be to take care of the Fort.

Will you make that for me?
See you later.

Hello, he/she is Curtis, I am not home,
please leave his/her message.

Hello?
Specialist Delta, Curtis Braintree?

Bantree.
Am I to speak with...?

Excuse me, the American names
they are difficult to pronounce.

Yes, clear.
What can make for itself?

No. Is best it what can me to do for itself?

Hear, I give him/her 5 seconds before it hangs him/it.

Five seconds, it is what need.

He/she is well, then what is that
can you do for me?

I can assure him/her that you
he/she is a person died.

Am I? Because thank you very much for the warning.
See you later then.

Good-bye.

As if it felt to the knowledge of the
"end" of Sergeant Bantree?

"End?"
That is a good word!

"End", "neutralization",
"extermination", "fire friend"...

that other one is also good.
"Secret", "illegal Chuis"...

You have an Agency that only
they can publish this parts of speech.

and they still call everything
this "a circus."

Military rules.
I know the rules.

Then answer to my question.

How did I feel?
My priority is my family...

my wife and my children.

And how they see,
Curtis was as of the family.

Thank you!

Say!
Mister...

It is for itself.

Yes!
Good days, Charlie.

With who I do speak?

An old enemy.

Oh, yes? Which?
What is that you want?

I want you, Charlie.

Then because you don't leave
from where are to see yourself.

Because that is not the way as you do,
it is not?

I don't know than you are me to speak.

Somebody wants to speak with you,
Charlie.

Charlie, helps me!

Everything will turn out right, love.

Now that I have your attention...

Who are you?

Ok Charlie, these are the rules...

First I will kill you,
as you killed my brother and to my men.

Here and in front of all!

In my Country, when
we hunted a Bear...

we didn't kill him/it there same,
we give him/her the opportunity to escape.

I want that you run, Charlie.
I want you to think in as it will be your death.

I want you to be afraid of dying and not
to know nor when nor where.

It is only more other day for me, friend.

He/she thinks about your family, Charlie.

You are a dead man,
only that you still don't know him/it.

You arrived late, I already have them in my power.
It silences you and he/she listens.

Leaning that could kill my brother
and to my men...

and to return to your Country, without further ado,
as if everything was forgotten.

No Charlie.
This time you won't forget...

this time the war came home with you.

You remember the park, the girl to sing
and the veteran of war?

I have something there for you...
some flowers...

if you get to arrive,
you can save them.

And he/she reminds you, Charlie...

If you talk to somebody about this,
one polices, to the woman, to any one!...

… they will die,
no you Charlie, them.

As he/she said, Charlie.
There are rules in this.

He/she sees the light post in front,
the globe is…

it is more or less the size
of your head.

And he/she reminds you, if you speak with
somebody they will die.

As your family, Charlie.

Then you contacted the "administration"
without authorization.

I did what had to do.

The first contact in a situation like this,
he/she is his/her Commander.

Nolan was the only on whom
he/she could trust on that moment.

To notify, to improvise, to use.
Basic rules of training.

Company of Samuel and Siblings.

Maggie Johnson please.

Lament, you Johnson still didn't arrive...

Please introduce his/her identification.

Please wait.

National agency of Safety.
Center of Communications for Satellite.

Hello Charlie,
How are you, my brother?

He/she hears, you have to tell me,
how was the climate in the coast This?

Nolan!
I am I and unmarried woman.

How is that of you leave us?

What does happen he/she, my brother?
No longer you like to travel?

He/she hears me with a lot of attention.
This well, I hear you.

They discovered me.

That you speak?
Charlie, that is impossible.

Nobody can see your file..

Because somebody made him/it.
There is a, maybe two or three...

and they are professional.

I believe, your word is enough for me.

He/she is well. I have been covering you,
he/she tells me just the one that I have do.

I want you to find
Maggie and the children.

They said that you/they had them
but I want to have the certainty.

It verifies the old address.
It is well.

I have to my front, all
the numbers that I need, now listen...

he/she tells me from where are and I send you two agents
before you place the telephone.

No, now he/she listens to me...
don't say anybody.

That shit speeches, Charlie?
You cannot make this alone,

you want him to remind you of the
rules of the house?

Now, he/she waits there and I will send you two agents
the fastest that it can..

Don't forget that you are just a civilian.

He/she leaves me just to do you a report.

No, they said that if they saw somebody
to help me, they matá-los-went.

That means, that nobody can help myself.
That is only between you and me.

You and me?
Char...

Charlie, both we can enter
in serious problems, do you know?

On the other hand, my area supervisor is
to arrange an excuse to order me for…

the "manuseamento of files" and
I don't belong to that.

Oh, what is,
without value there is no glory.

As he/she told you, I cover your backs
but, you are without protecção...

in other words, as besides I can do
to meet.

I still don't know.

I need that find
Curtis also...

I have a bad premonition
concerning this.

Charlie, are you there?
Charlie?

Now our Bear
he/she begins to run.

Linda woman,
you won't be any problem.

Don't play me.

You have to be quiet except
I will make to remain silent.

He/she stole my telephone!
He/she stole my telephone!

I have a robbery in the park, a telemóvel.
Suspect escaped among them hoist,

and it is going in the direcção This,
I need the Police of Los Angeles.

Attention the all of the units of the park,
he/she looks for of a suspect,

Caucasian, 1.82 meters, 87 kilos.
Telemóvel robbery.

He/she is careful Charlie.

Hello, I am me again.

Charlie, I called the school,
your children are well,

but I didn't get to find Maggie.

They have her.
Oh my God.

Don't worry, I will order
somebody to collect the children.

Ok. It links me to Donovan,
he/she should be on some side of L.A.

Are you to play? Charlie,
he is in the blacklist of the Agency.

Therefore it is the only
on whom can trust.

Reason?
You know what did in Balkans,

he/she had luck of not being in the list
of extermination of the Agency.

No, it is only to pass for
difficult times.

Haul of that, he/she left does six months and
nobody knows where to find him/it,

besides if you want to find him/it.

I know him/it, it seeks him/it in the coffee of the
Maysie downtown.

Good, fortunately you know
where finding.

We have past a lot of thing together.

I violated a lot of
rules for that so-and-so.

Nolan?
It is well, it is well. No longer I speak about him.

Did you hear some thing on Curtis?

Not to the moment.
He/she still didn't answer to the telephone.

He/she hears, Charlie.
I have to tell you this.

I am very nervous,
I don't know if I can make this alone.

He/she lets to call me for support.

No.
What do have in the satellites?

Because, not a lot, without one
official authorization.

I don't have real time in video and only if
actualiza every 30 seconds, or more.

Because he owes a spy in some side
and somebody with Maggie.

They should have three.

Is it true that will do this alone, not?

You will make the hero paper in this everything.

Charlie, the world is full of heroes
but unhappily they are dead.

You really want to end with
the list of those "finished."

Nolan have to believe me...

they are suspected that somebody me
he/she is to help, they will kill her.

They want me.

Charlie, maybe be the sobrestimar
this man.

I want to say, up to now it has not been being able to
to do anything to you nor the children.

No!
This type is good.

Only making his/her game and
he/she only wants to see me to run.

And that is what I will do.

Now, I will need a weapon.

He/she says Donovan to put in some
place, a HK-91.

It is later can seek the spy,

but they don't make anything until that you/they have mine
children in a safe place. Is he/she clear?

It is well, you are the Boss.
Well.

Charlie?
Wait.

Is Charlie there?

I believe that it is him to try to locate her/it me,
he/she tracks the telephones of the park and...

he/she seeks the location of this call.

There is no problem.

But he/she listens, I will need one minute
for finding, it maintains him/it in line.

He/she is well.

I can see you of here, Charlie.

Then, it kills me.

Cannot you see me, not?

You can be to be seen.

I refer to you.
I know that your spy can.

It is a feather that you don't have
tomatoes for you kill me you even.

I can do what want
and when I want,

I can put an end to yours
life when he/she wants.

Be not stupid, Charlie.
You only have to the sunset,

to find your family.
Maybe the “chu-chu” number a, help you.

Wait.
Ei.

Nolan?
I am here.

Do you have something?

I have enough for an I track of voice.
Well.

Now discovers
who is that type.

He/she gave me other place! He/she mentioned "chu-chu."
I believe that he/she wanted to say the park of the convoy.

The telemóvel is to be without battery,
I need a radio and a weapon.

Don't worry, they will be there.

He/she listens, taken care outside, ok.
You don't have any support.

I don't want that anything you happen,
did you understand?

He/she is well.

Charlie? Charlie!
Damned you are, Charlie?

What is to do?
Mister.

Stop.
You were to speak with somebody.

Yes, it was to speak with mine
computer Charlie.

Damned you are, Charlie.

Where are you, Charlie?

Do you see safety's guard?

I suppose that we would meet here and us
it would take where it was the robbery of the telemóvel.

This should be a case for
a simple patrol guard,

therefore they dress uniforms
and we dressed fact.

The Headquarters asked us that us
we gathered with him here.

It should be for here in some side.
Of all the forms will stretch out the muscles.

High, don't move.
It puts you down of belly..

This is not a good idea.

You already heard me, he/she already said
it puts you down of belly.

I am not able to, now he/she listens to me,
he/she is in serious danger.

Belly down.

"Nick's"

Donovan. Please.

He/she is your mother.

Yes!

Donovan, is Nolan.

He/she listens, Charlie's wife was
kidnapped and that is a tremendous situation,

and he/she doesn't have any support.

Hear, I know that already plenty time passed,
but we know that can help us.

What was all this?

I notified you Demmings, levá-la-ei
his/her class inside of one moment.

I apologize for requesting so much
identification but...

he/she should understand that should be a lot
careful on these days.

I need that me light ace children.

Because, when I was at the school
he/she didn't need to worry for these things.

Oh, his/her accent,
is it Russian?

No, for anything.

Here it is.
Mrs. Demmings!

Where are the children?
Lisa and Sam?

I end of giving to his/her uncle.
To his/her uncle? Which uncle?

Where do we go, Tio Donnie?

I will take care of you for some instants,

I lost him/it.
He/she finds him/it.

Do they want something to eat?
It is well.

You are the sure that Charlie
did he/she tell you for you make this?

Donnie, that happens?

If he/she tells you, he/she will have to kill you.

Then, being like this
it is better not to ask.

I will collect your father,
will you be well here?

Do they want cookies with milk?

Side This of the dam.
He/she is going crossing until in half.

The wind approaches of the water
approximately to 6 us...

some mil/pontos ahead.

He/she goes, it goes.
There it is where you are.

He/she is going from behind of the fence.

How are you me to see?

I already have him/it again. He/she is in...

He/she found the finder.

You cannot lose him/it,
understood?

He/she will already appear.

No, he knows this place very well,
you cannot lose him/it.

You should do with that he/she appears in the place,
right now.

He/she could leave badly.
We should not try.

I won't return you to say.
He/she orders him/it now.

Hello Donovan,

Yes.
Where?

In the top of the park.

Well, then I will facilitate you.

The spy's last position was in it
limit of the park.

In the Northwest corner. I have two points
to blink in the thermal radar.

The movement finder indicates that the
spy can be in an of the two places,

The two close to the sniper.

Are you the sure of that?
Yes.

Hello, friendly.
Do you have a cigarette?

minutes, or the flowers leave.

Wait one second.
Three minutes.

For more how long

Not for a lot.

Is the dad well?

Of course yes.

telemóvel left the park.

He/she already has her, don't shoot.

Well thought Donovan.

Is yours?
Yes.

Then, because it hid him/it in the grass?

It would be like this safer.
No if he/she forgets.

You are right.

I hear you, Donovan.

Do you listen something?

I believe that you/they already have the package.
And you that have?

Charlie was right,
there is one equips completes.

Spy and sniper.

Charlie thinks that has something to see
with his/her last work.

He/she waits, I am to receive
an information.

I have the head office of confirmed voice.

He/she is a called man Yevon Bodnar, and
I am to receive more information.

Hello Donovan, listens this, Bodnar leads
a counterattack group...

with financial connections to unions of
several crimes in the...

Medium East and in the This of Europe.

Basically, he sells mercenaries
to the best request.

Do you have a picture?
He/she will already appear.

When will that be?

That is the far away
that can take you.

The river of Los Angeles is for beyond,
the freeway is above,

And the city is in that direcção.
See you later.

Wait one second.
One more favor.

He/she looks at this picture well.
He/she tells me if you recognize something.

Something as the place where was removed.

Who is?

My wife.

It is very beautiful.

That he/she walks her to do her/it with a badameco
like you?

I already asked me even
for many years.

This could be in any besiege.

Will she be lost?

No, they kidnapped her.

He/she looks, I don't want to wrap up
with something like that, ok?

Are you a police?
Not.

That is something that I have that
to solve for me even.

Do you have children?

Yes.
Two.

Charlie, are you there?

Yes, ahead.

He/she hears Charlie,
I have, bad you announce.

The police received a call from one
man that drove for "Canyon Road",

and he/she saw Curtis' car fly in pieces.

Charlie, I feel a lot, but
Curtis is dead.

I am going to the war, take your
final positions.

Charlie?
Where are you?

I found the damned, but I didn't get
to find the sniper.

Where caralho are?

Somewhere to the side
of the river of Los Angeles.

What shit is to do there?

They are to guide me, Donovan, I think if
they are to hide close to the river.

That river runs during quilómetros.

They attracted me here.

The spy left, and me also.
It goes.

Nolan?
I am here and I think I know who is.

Who is?

The name is Yevon Bodnar and you are right,
It is of the last work, the one of Zebistan.

I don't know my brother, I find
that if it escaped you one.

He/she waits, I will have recognition
of the face inside of one seconds.

Charlie, Bodnar is not a good boy, it is
a member of a paramilitary group,

that he/she sells their services to the best price,
most groups of the Medium East.

But he/she hears this, it was a bad boy in the
Chechénia because not even...

the Russians wanted to have
anything to see with him.

He/she seems it was part of one
illegal organization here us...

in the United States, but not
he/she has a lot to speak.

Charlie, this type is a great terrorist
world, care with him.

There is no problem.

Well, because we were already in a lot of ranch and me not
I am ready to get lost now.

He/she won't pass.
In the thermal radar what is there?

Wait.
I already have him/it.

It seems that there is a lot of heat beyond.

It prepares you, because this is
to put very hot.

Your husband seems that it still continues
with life, but...

but that pity, soon more will be dead.

He/she is to enter in the park.

Probably on the side This.

Hello, the picture that showed me...
I know where it is.

The where?

In the old prison, a little more above the river.

They closed her/it before me am born,
nobody returned her to use.

That is a great help, thank you.

We go, I will show you.

Two different shootings.
A busy day.

He/she doesn't fit,
I don't get to imagine.

That type was murdered with his/her weapon
and this died for a squeeze from behind...

that it broke him/her the neck.
It is there is still the one of the park of the convoy.

Then you think
all are linked.

The park is very small
for so much coincidence.

Ok, that it is to the to flee
our suspect?

I don't know, but we will have
of stopping quickly.

What road do think he/she chose?
The mountains to our turn,

or it was underneath of the river.

He/she has to be for the river.

Now yes, you are to think
Sherlock.

I hope it is comfortable.

It is going to the hell.
I live there.

It is now,
also you and Charlie.

He/she will never be able to leave of here.

Actually, I could never understand the attitude
that the Americans have.

The bravery, or maybe stupidity...
when they are against the wall...

and without place where to go,
because they don't give up?

Because we are correctos.

Ah! But clear,

the divine right of America of saying to the
world as they should live.

Because you have 200 cereals for the
small-lunch in the supermarket,

do they think that we needed that?

He/she hears me.
No longer they can continue us to ignore.

His/her husband soon will be here
prontinho for to save,

as in all the films
of Hollywood,

but this will finish a little different.

he/she won't save her nor you to him.
You will lose.

This time, the bad will win.

It is exactly up there.

Donovan?
Yes.

You know the old prison
that it is beside the river.

Yes, I will give a view of eyes.

I will enter.
It protects the backs.

Nolan?

Charlie,
can you see the prison?

No, and you don't have
anything in the thermal radar?

I am in that.
He/she sees her that the prison has some residents.

But since they closed is able to be her
any one, beggars, cheap...

Some movement?
Three potential "Objectives."

Charlie, leaning that the
Can Maggie be there?

I think my "enemy"
he/she wants that will discover.

Because they took her?

They want me.

Will you kill this type, ah?
What if he/she sits down when anybody is killed?

I never thought about that.

With that weapon class, almost
that could see them in the eyes.

Sometimes.

Do your children know that it is it what do?
The Bible says that she should not kill.

Sometimes God uses the darkness
to give us more light.

Both of us have worlds
a lot of bad, don't you find?

You should go.

Not even I know your name.

Charlie.
My name is Sunny.

Do you see him/it what want to tell you?

It is careful, Charlie.
You also.

Nolan?
I am here.

Did you already find them?

I am already in that for you, Donovan.

He/she listens, I have other two illustrations and
I don't have idea of who can be.

He/she waits, one of them is been to move and
the other is in the same place,

more or less the about 45
meters to your front.

Understood.

Nolan, am to west,
what do visualize?

I have three illustrations inside the
prison on the south side,

nobody is to his/her turn.

Ok, listens. One is the
to move and the other ones two are quiet.

He/she hears Charlie, you only have an opportunity
and I don't want to give you the wrong.

Do Donovan, already have the spy?
Yes.

I see the Bear, and it comes for here.
The where?

A dead.
Good work.

Does he/she repeat, where are you?
Damned you are.

Yes gentleman.
I arrive in five minutes.

We have a report of a Caucasian man
close to the river of Los Angeles,

taking a weapon of great load.

A weapon of great load?

He/she thinks that is our man.

I don't know, we go.

Where do we go?

If who is to run the river near
he/she is our suspect,

what believes that it is, and if
it follows the same direcção,

I think we will reach him/it
in the old prison Lincoln.

Nolan?
Charlie, I can just hear you.

In what direcção they are?
It moves you a little for the right.

Ok, already get to see you. The more loud
you go, better I can see you,

and when you are at the level of the other ones
I will tell you and there it is where they are.

He/she is well, now it is here with me Nolan.

It maintains an eye in my backs.

Second floor.

Ok Charlie, there are two illustrations
a little more visible than you,

probably because you are
two or three levels below.

He/she continues to move and like this
I can see you better.

Understood.

To your left, Charlie.
Bravo, you are in the same level.

There are cells in all of the sides and
a great open corridor.

Charlie to your left, to 18 meters.
You are almost to arrive.

He/she moves you.

A dead, but
they still have Maggie.

Charlie, I have two illustrations above you
and they move fast,

I believe that it is a higher level.

He/she moves you.

He/she continues to walk.

Charlie, they are above you.

Is it here?
Yes, we go.

He/she looks in front Charlie.

They are three illustrations, two of them are to the
your front. He/she has to be Maggie.

Turn off.

Lament Mister, I cannot make that.

We have a life situation or death
outside with one of ours.

Charlie Snow is not one of ours.

He/she abandoned the Agency,
we don't have any obligation.

But Mister, technically still
he/she belongs to the Agency,

and that does with that we have
obligation with him.

You leave him/it of that sorts things out and deixá-la-ei to go
just with a warning,

doutra forms you are out also.

This well.
Then I am out also.

But not before finishing this work.

Charlie Snow is there without connection,
he/she doesn't have anything and they have his/her wife.

Not even he/she can ask for us help.

Nevertheless I have that him
everything to supply of here,

so that he and his/her wife leave alive
of this, it is exactamente that I will do.

Please, Mister, for love of God, not
he/she sees that that man needs our help.

Charlie has to solve their problems
for his/her own bill.

He made this decision
when he/she abandoned the Agency.

Then respectfully I make petition of
I access to his/her superior,

as dictated the protocol
of the norms of the Agency.

You want to pass on my head.
Yes, gentleman. It is immediately, Mister.

It frees her.
Charlie!

Quiet.
He/she releases the weapon.

I belong to the special units
and they have my wife as hostage,

I don't have time for this.

It releases the weapon or shot.
It releases her already.

They have my wife.

It places the weapon in the ground, we don't want
that skirt hurt, he/she throws her already.

Then you will have to shoot.

Asking for support in the old prison, several
dead suspects, I request helicopter.

Quiet, it lets to go her and it places your weapon in the
ground, you don't have to go where.

Still no Charlie, we have unites
debt to pay off. You and me.

He/she lets to go her
and I will let to live you.

Leaning that that is what worries me.

The only way to live this battle is
to finish her/it in sacks for corpses.

He/she is well. He/she lets to go her, she doesn't have
anything to see with everything this.

Do you want him to let to go her?
He/she shoots your weapon and I let to go her.

That never she will pass.

Already everything finished.

It lets to go her and it places your weapon.
He/she makes him/it already.

I don't like that idea a lot.
You removed me something that I loved,

and now I will remove you something that you love.
The decision is yours.

This is your last opportunity.
This time no, Charlie.

Police, release the weapon.

Are you well?
Yes. I am well.

Thank you Charlie.
I love you.

She will be well.
Will it take some time, and with you?

always, since
my family is well.

Dad.

They will see the mammy.

Thank you.

Thank you Nolan.
Accomplished mission.

No there is my problem brother, I am happy
that you and Maggie are safe.

We see each other thereabout.

One month later,

Charlie Snow was removed honorariamente
of the I exercise of the United States.

Now he/she teaches in a
school in Los Angeles,

and he/she teaches their children to play soccer.
