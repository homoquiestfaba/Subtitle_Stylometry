MOSES:
Do you, Alice,

take Joseph...

to be your husband

in sickness and in health...

until distance do you part?

I do.

And do you, Joseph,

take Alice to be your wife...

in sickness
and in health

until distance do you part?

I do.

I now pronounce you...

man and wife.

[ Gunshot ]

PAUL: Joseph!

Joseph!

Joseph!

[ Frogs, insects chirping ]

The Lord has decided
that he needed to test us.

Mr. Paul?
PAUL: The deed has been done.

It wasn't a rabbit.

You arrogance blinded you,
Joseph.

We'll note it for Sunday.

Now grab one end.

[ Somber music plays ]

[ Insects chirping ]

PAUL: He said,
"If you will diligently listen

to the voice of the Lord,
your God,

and do that
which is right in His eyes...

...give ears to His commands
and keep all His statutes,

I will put none
of the diseases on you

that I put on the Egyptians...

...for I am the Lord,
your healer."

[ Music continues ]

Mr. Paul.
Mr. Paul!

Mr. Paul!
I caught a rat!

[ Whip thudding,
Joseph grunting ]

Don't even think
about helping him up.

He did this on his own.

He can get up on his own.

AARON: Y'all heard him.
Get back to work!

Back to work.

Back to work, boy.

[ Insects chirping,
owl hooting ]

[ Door opens ]
Hold still.

[ Joseph groans ]

MOSES:
Ruthie?

You can't be sneaking over here
and playing like this.

RUTH: As the oldest woman
in this bunch,

I think I can do just about
anything I want to do.

And right now,
I want to see my son.

Best not to hear
those stories tonight, Alice.

Her reading's
the only thing we got.

We can't keep doing this.

We thank keep letting Mr. Paul
do what he wants.

It's a choice
we don't have to make.

RUTH: If any one of us
start acting up,

you know what would happen?

We'd all die.

There's 12 of us.

There's one of him.

Three if you count
Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Aaron.

Not all of us had the teaching
from Mr. Paul you had.

MOSES: How?

The men that hunt runaways
work at night.

We've all heard the stories.

I ain't never heard of them
hunting in the day.

It won't work, Alice.

She ain't wrong
for thinking about it.

None of us are.

There's got to be
something else.

A bunch of white men
out there waiting...

to kill us, keep us, or sell us.

I need to speak to my wife.

Alone.

[ Hinges creaking, door closes ]

Joseph, this place...
Paul knows.

About us.

About everything.

[ Ominous music plays ]

[ Bells tolling ]

[ Music continues ]

No, my brothers and sisters!

This was no messenger from God.

This was a warning
from the devil himself.

Even in our gracious state
of Georgia...

on God-given land,

the devil has ways
of sending an emissary.

He said, "You must continue
to be fruitful.

Not only for yourselves,
but for your domestic livestock,

for they, too, must be bathed
in the bounty of birth.

Or I will...

take it all away."

[ Music continues ]

PAUL: I need to have
a word with you.

How long has it been
since we lost your beloved?

Long time ago.

I've always tried my best
to take care of you.

Haven't I?

You want to be inside.
Is that it?

No, sir.

PAUL:
A home life.

This is what you're longing for,
isn't it?

When your wife passed...
I should've married you off.

Could have had sons
working by your side.

Mr. Paul, I...

Our neighbor, Brother Levi,

has offered one of his domestics
to be your bride.

I'm happy, Mr. Paul.

I-I work hard.
I-I don't need...

The message was clear.
You need to be fruitful.

Along with
the other domestics.

This... This is a big thing
Brother Levi is doing for us.

He hasn't been as blessed
with his domestics.

[ Chuckles ]

We've agreed
that the first child

will rightfully go to him.

You'll leave this week to...

[ Chuckles ]

...to procreate.

And then, when the pregnancy
is confirmed,

you can return.

[ Chuckles softly ]

This is so much bigger
than... than us.

[ Clock chiming, dishes
clattering in distance ]

Daniel's coming home tomorrow.

MRS. BENNETT:
And Rachel.

She's been gone a long time now.

Your mind's not
what it used to be, Mother.

It's Sunday.

I said it's Sunday.

I know.

You go on ahead of me.

What about Mrs. Bennett?

Ruth can put her to bed.

[ Ominous music plays ]

[ Somber music plays ]

Nobody said you could sit there.

You think you look like this?

I just looked at the picture.

I didn't...

You don't read good enough
to understand...

the meaning, Alice.

I-I only taught you

so you could read to me
as a domestic.

Understand?

Understand?

Yes.

Good.

Sit.

On the bed.

JOSEPH: Have you ever thought
about running away?

MOSES: Pondering is only
gonna make you feel worse.

Have you ever thought about it?

We don't...
We don't talk about that.

I didn't ask
if we talked about it.

I asked you
if you thought about it.

Used to.

But I just chose
not to see things

out of my control.

That kind of thinking
will get you killed.

You ever hear stories
about anyone making it out?

Your granddaddy...

...once said he... he saw a man.

[ Down-tempo music plays ]

One of us.

As if...

As if he just fell from the sky.

Could start a fire
with his hands.

Mm-hmm.

He's still out there.

My daddy...

buried him over in that...
in that corral.

Strangest-looking man
he'd ever seen.

Did you see him?
Oh, no, I wasn't...

I wasn't trying to.

PAUL:
We can fix those.

You like your schoolin'?

Well, I'll bet you have
a lot of friends.

Not really.

Well, you know what that means.

You're a smarter person.

They don't understand you.

A man is rich
not by what he owns,

but by what he can do without.

Mrs. Bennett awake?

RUTH: Mm-hmm.
She's in the sitting room.

PAUL: Well, get her.
Her grandson's home.

ALICE:
Hi, Mr. Daniel.

Hi.

Don't you see it?

[ Insects chirping ]

[ Hinges creaking ]

[ Lighter clicks ]

I found this.

What is it?

Something from somewhere.

Someone from someplace.

Who?

Someone like us.

There's more than we know...

more than we can see.

We have to go.

I don't know.
We'll go.

If we make it out,
we come back for everyone

and burn this place
to the ground.

Aaron's got a gun.

You let me worry about that.

What if...

[ Floorboard creaks ]

What if there's nothing
out there?

I'll take my chances.

Will you?

Yes.

Wait for my signal.

to make me nothing.

I wanted to.

It's good.

Listen.

We got to figure out
what you have to do.

Maybe some woman's home
or some place

they can help you
get your memory back.

I haven't lost
my memory.

You may think...
I haven't lost my memory.

I know exactly who I am
and where I came from.

These books told me.

Who are you then?

I'm me.

I know, Alice.
I know you Alice.

But who are you?

My whole life's
been a lie, Frank.

Not just part.

Not the kind of lies

people tell themselves
to get by.

The whole thing.

So, who are you?

I was a slave, Frank.

Do you...

Do you know what
you're saying?

Do you?

I know exactly
what I'm saying.

No, do you? Do you really know
what you're saying right now?

Listen.

Alice, I need you
to tell me who you really are

or whoever it is...
I just told you who I was.

Alice...

You need to get somebody
that can help you.

Why can't you help me?

[ Voice breaking ]
Because I'm nobody.

[ Inhales sharply ]

[ Sighs deeply ]

I'm meeting somebody
tomorrow.

Somebody...

I knew.

That's... That's good.

That's...

That's great.

You...

You want me to take you?

I'd like that.

[ Diana Ross & The Supremes'
"Reflections" plays ]

<i>Through the mirror of my mind</i>

<i>Time after time</i>

<i>I see reflections
of you and me</i>

<i>Reflections of</i>

<i>The love you took from me</i>

<i>Oh, I'm all alone now</i>

<i>No love to shield me</i>

<i>Trapped in a world that's</i>

<i>A distorted reality</i>

<i>Through the mirror of my mind</i>

<i>Through these tears
that I'm crying</i>

<i>Reflects a hurt I can't control</i>

<i>'Cause although you're gone</i>

<i>I keep holding on</i>

<i>To the happy times</i>

<i>Ooh, when you were mine</i>

<i>As I peer through the window</i>

<i>Of lost time</i>

<i>Looking over my yesterdays</i>

<i>And all the love
I gave all in vain</i>

<i>All the love</i>

<i>All the love that I've wasted</i>

<i>All the tears</i>

<i>All the tears that I've tasted</i>

<i>All in vain</i>

<i>Through the hollow of my tears</i>

<i>I see a dream that's lost</i>

<i>From the hurt</i>

<i>That you have caused</i>

<i>Everywhere I turn</i>

<i>Seems like everything I see</i>

<i>Reflects the love
that used to be</i>

<i>In you I put</i>

<i>All my faith and trust</i>

<i>Right before my eyes</i>

It's <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

How do I look?

Like you.

<i>Just a handful of promises</i>

<i>Are all that's left
of loving you</i>

<i>All the love</i>

<i>All the love that I've wasted</i>

<i>All the tears</i>

<i>All the tears that I've tasted</i>

<i>All in vain</i>

[ Engine turns off,
music stops ]

You gonna be okay
going to see your friend?

She was never my friend.

She ain't your friend?

That's right.

How does that work?

Just does.

You need me to come with you?

No.

[ Upbeat music plays ]

[ Bells chime ]

WAITRESS:
Sit anywhere you want.

Just you?

I'm waiting on somebody.

WAITRESS: Coffee?

[ Mud thuds gently ]

[ Bells chime ]

I-I'm looking for someone,
a woman.

WAITRESS: There's
a lot of women here.

A Negro woman.

Take it easy.
Take care.

Alice.

You look so different.

You don't.

[ <i>Indistinct talking,</i>
<i>radio static</i> ]

[ Bells chime ]

WAITRESS:
Self-seating.

Sweetie, turn that down.

He's obsessed with that thing.

I hid it in his suitcase
when he went to see Paul.

WAITRESS:
Any coffee?

RACHEL:
I'm shocked he didn't find it.

I heard it.

I'm hungry, Alice.

I'm not here to serve you.

Why don't you go
check out that machine

while mommy talks, okay?

RACHEL: Alice...

I'm not afraid of you anymore.

You should never
have been afraid.

We always wanted
to provide a safe place

for our domestics.

Yes.

That includes discipline.

But every home
needs structure.

Life before people got confused
about their place,

and it was
a lot less hard...

I was never confused.

I was lied to.

You blame me?

I always thought of you
as family.

Stop with the lies,
Rachel.

My family died
so yours could leave.

I am not the devil,
Alice.

No, the devil got to you
long before you left.

I am learning every...
Enough.

RACHEL: Why'd you ask me here
if I can't talk?

Because this whole thing,

me sitting
across from you,

this ain't about <i>you.</i>

This is about me

seeing you

for exactly what you are.

Outside of that backwards world
I was born into to believe

you were actually somebody.
Alice...

I thought if I could see you
out in the open,

It might stop me
from thinking about hunting down

and doing something to make sure
you never forget my name.

Watch it, Alice.
But Daniel

needs at least one parent.

Alice!

I'm not scared.

And that should
scare you...

Alice!
Shut the hell up!

It's my turn now.

You left us there to die.

You watched us
get tormented.

And you thought
I wanted to meet up with you

just to hear you talk.

I don't give a damn
about your life.

Freedom...

is something you will never
understand in a million years.

[ Gasps ]

I <i>am</i> freedom.

Daniel! Daniel!

Alice.
Frank?

Daniel, come.
Come.

WAITRESS: Y'all need to leave.
Alice, wait. Wait, Alice.

WAITRESS: Hey, hey, hey.
You got a bill.

[ Bell dings ]

What about Alice?
Get in the car right now!

[ Engine starts ]
Rachel!

Don't...

[ Indistinct shouting ]

You let them get away!
Go to hell!

[ Tires screech ]

Alice...

[ Panting ]

[ Gasps ]

I have to go back.

Nah, you can't go back.
What you talking about?

You know what will happen
to you?

Everybody that's ever
cared about me is still there.

I got to get them out.

I'm'a need some more books.

[ Upbeat music plays ]

[ Music continues ]

[ Music continues ]

<i>What would you do?
Kill all of them?</i>

<i>Well, why not? Nothing
else seems to do any good.</i>

<i>You know who they are.
Everybody knows who they are.</i>

<i>And the law is in
for a piece of the action.</i>

MAN:
[ <i>Spits</i> ]

<i>So, you want to play
with knives?</i>

<i>You want to spit on me and make
me crawl, white motherfucker?</i>

<i>Well, you picked
the wrong player.</i>

<i>It seems like I'm in a dream.</i>

<i>And I'm still in this dream,</i>

<i>and it wouldn't take much
for me to kill you now.</i>

<i>Shit. Look.
I ain't gonna shoot you.</i>

<i>I'm gonna piss on your grave
tomorrow.</i>

[ Indistinct conversations ]

What'd you think?

She wasn't real.

Was she?

What she believed in,
what she stood for was.

Right on.

You said you was going back.

I am.

What's going on, Alice?

I'm going back.
Tomorrow.

You can't go back by yourself.

The police ain't gonna help...
Police?

Them folk that's supposed
to help people.

Well, they help
some people sometimes.

You can't help me?

You still do what
your brother tells you.

So you no different
than me.

But you used to stand
for something...

the marches, the sit-ins.

I saw them
in your memory box.

Frank.

What happened to you?

What happened...

was I spent
a decade of my life

trying to help the cause.

and make a change
for the people.

That's what
happened to me.

You know what changed.

My mother died,

and I got older,

and the leaders got killed,

and everybody
just stopped trying.

That's what happened.

But you can
make a change.

You can make a change now.

Something that's bigger
than yourself.

Like Coffy.

Oh, Alice.

Oh, no. Just...

A Black man trying
to do something for hisself.

Where is that gonna happen
in America?

That's a death certificate.

You understand me?

I'm asking myself
to get killed doing that.

That's what that is.

Where is that gonna happen?
You tell me that.

But you can do something.

You ain't got
no birth certificate

or no Social Security, no I.D.

You... You can do
what you want.

I didn't expect you
to say yes,

but just so you know,

doing the right thing

is never wrong.

I'm wrong because
I can't help you.

ALICE: No.

You're wrong...

'cause you don't believe.

Not any more.

What's your plan?

[ Upbeat music plays ]

We might need these.

[ Guns clatter ]

You came out
right about here.

That's the service road
right there.

You want
to take the road?

FRANK: For what we want to do,
we better.

Yeah, then everybody
can see the truth.

What's public transit?

It's a bus, Alice.

It pick people up and
take them where they need to go.

You sure you want to do this?
I'm sure.

Well, tomorrow night,

if you change your mind
at any time,

they don't
make you weaker.

We can figure out
how to get everybody out.

Like what?

Well, everything
don't work out as planned.

I used to dream of breaking
my mom out of that hospital.

Why didn't you?

I didn't believe I could.

Frank.

I'm not backing out.

[ Telephone rings ]

Hello.

FRANK: <i>Alice.</i>

Frank.

Frank.

I can't do it.
I can't.

<i>I just...
I can't do it.</i>

<i>And, Alice, I don't think
you should do it either.</i>

<i>I really don't...</i>

[ Dial tone ]

Alice?

DANNY: You all right?

Nodding's not
an answer, Frank.

You okay?

Frank?

Nodding is an answer,
Danny.

Be cool.

Nah. You be cool.

I've been cool for a long time.

What's this?

What this is, is I'm telling you
to get out my face.

I'm my own man.
I think for myself.

And you know what
a motherfucking nod is.

[ Upbeat music plays ]

Hi.

Hello.

[ Music continues ]

[ Brakes squeak,

Get in.

It's better than the bus.

[ Music continues ]

FRANK: 10-8, there's a wildfire
on the I-55 highway.

DISPATCH: <i>Copy that.
What's your 20?</i>

A service road right off

<i>Fire truck en route.</i>

it was gonna be?

You ain't gonna
win this fight.

Get your ass back.

You're not gonna
leave here again.

At least not in one piece.

Get inside.

Sit.

On the bed.

[ Chuckles ]

What do you want, Alice?

I want...

everyone to see the truth.

Well, all they're gonna see
is fire,

and thanks to you,
they're gonna work

through the night,
putting it out.

No.

No, they're not.

My family's done working
for you.

It's over.

Everything you hid from us,

all the lies you told

to make yourself
feel important...

it's all coming down
right before your eyes.

Some things...

you can't hide forever.

I'm smarter than you.

I'm better than you.

And I know
that scares you.

How does it feel?

I gave you all
a meaningful life!

Meaningful.

This tradition was born
long before you.

[ Chuckles ]

Alice, you j...
[ Laughs ]

You don't make sense.

I never told anyone
that they had to stay.

[ Insects chirping ]

[ Sentimental music plays ]

I just never told them
that they could go.

[ Music continues ]

What are you gonna do?

Hmm?

You gonna kill me?

I'm gonna make sure

your last few breaths
feel like hell.

Well, Hell, Alice...

Is where you're going!
...is where you're going!
