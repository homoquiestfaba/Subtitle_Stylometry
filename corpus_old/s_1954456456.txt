<i> Was there an autopsy performed?</i>

             What kind of drugs
                    was she on?

Simon, had she been ill
for long?

                     Were there
      prescription medications?

         INTERVIEWER:
<i> Simon, what killed Brittany?</i>

            You did.

      You all killed her.

            ( SOBS )

 From the day of her birth,

Brittany
was my precious angel.

There's never been
anyone or anything

that means more to me
in this universe.

I raised her alone,

and we didn't always
have a lot at first,

    <i> but we had each other.</i>

     No, no. I, I promise
   this isn't a sales call.

            Hey, Ma.

  So, what happened is you,
you filled out a raffle ticket.

         <i> Yeah, and...</i>

            <i> Hello?</i>

          Well, hope your day's
   been going better than mine.

          It was okay.

          Ready to go?

            Can't you just take
     one day off, baby, please?

       Ma. No, please.
         Ple-e-e-ase.

                        SHARON:
     <i> Honey, I cannot get away,</i>

  not until I make at least
  one of these appointments.

                     <i> I have to.</i>

Oh, okay, well, let's see
what we can do about that.

                     Oh.

( GIGGLES )
Alyssa, Alyssa Cooper.

    Hm.

No one over the age of 20,
maybe 25, is named Alyssa.

 Means she's a young bride.

            Yeah?
            Uh-hm.

                What?

             Brit!

          ( CHUCKLES )

          BRITTANY:
         <i> Hi, Alyssa?</i>

      My name is Sharon,
        Sharon Murphy.

No, no, you don't but you are
  not going to believe this.

   <i> You remember that card</i>
     <i> that you filled out</i>

     <i> at the bridal show</i>
         <i> last week?</i>

         Yeah, well,
       congratulations.

          ( CHUCKLES )

Done!

                   Hey, you are
              really something.

                   ( CHUCKLES )
   What would I do without you?

Well, you would sell
a lot less china, crystal,

and what is it?

                       Cookware!

         ( CHUCKLES )
        Can we go now?

                       Yes.

  Now we've gone to Waterloo
            and...

          ( GIGGLES )

I love that they're having
so much fun.

                        I know.
             It's a good outlet

      from all that performance
            pressure at school.

   Yeah.

And they're so good,
aren't they?

                       They are!

             You know, Morgan's
               been pressing me

             to let her try out
   for this soap opera in town,

               but I don't know.

              What do you think?

I would just keep it
a hobby now.

They're so young.

                       They are.

       Ma, can I get some pizza
                   with Morgan?

          Please, pretty please?

        Oooh, how can we say no
                    to you two?

         ( GIGGLES )
            Okay.

Are you her mother?

          Yeah, I am.

       Franklin Turner.
             Oh.

       FRANKLIN: <i> I'm shooting</i>
                 <i> a commercial,</i>

 and I think that your daughter
              may be exactly...

               Yes! I am so in!
                    ( GIGGLES )

 I am so jealous!

      Uh, could you just
     give us a minute...

Yeah, come on.
Let's go, girls.

            ...with Mr. Turner,
                        please?

        Turn and walk.
          But Mom...

 Turn and walk.

  Um, I'm a little surprised.

         It's usually
   Brittany's friend Morgan

                       who gets
        this kind of attention.

Yeah, pretty actressy types--

you know, they come
a dime a dozen,

but your daughter has
an every-girl quality

 that we're really looking for.

Plus, she can really act.

          Uh, well,
I appreciate the compliments,

   but she is really young
    and still in school...

I hear you, but I think
she really has something.

Maybe if you just
take some time

and go talk it over
with her dad...

       Well, it's just us

    since she was two years old,

      but I will think about it.

 Great, nice to meet you.

              Nice to meet you.
                        Thanks.

                     You are so
      going to be tortured now.

         What happened to like,
   oh, it makes a better hobby?

I know.
This should be an easy no...

But I've been so squeezed
tightly on money.

What about just
one commercial?

                          Yeah,
         I mean one commercial,

  but you've got to be careful,
                        Sharon.

          You know that kind of
                    attention--

                 it's addictive.

           Hm.

It's the attention
she thrives on.

 It's got to be no.

          It's a no.
        Yeah, it's no.

    ON T.V.: <i> All he does</i>
   <i> is stare at me all day.</i>

          <i> God knows</i>
     <i> what he's thinking.</i>

    <i> Charlie, eat your peas.</i>

     <i> They're chock full</i>
        <i> of vitamin E.</i>

Fine.

You can do this
one commercial.

 One.

           ( SCREAM )

Maybe we'll leave a note
for school.

             This has got to be
                 the last time.

                     <i> Seriously.</i>

  I mean, you're treating it
  as if school is the hobby.

             It is!

      Making commercials
        is hard work.

Yes, exactly,
and that's why

you don't need to do three
in one day.

        It's okay, Ma,
       I can handle it.

                     Uh, no, no.

           Okay. You know what,
                 it isn't okay.

 <i> You need to be doing things</i>
         <i> like school</i>

and being with your friends
and normal things.

                     Since when
        do you and I do normal?

                       ( SIGHS )

     You cannot keep doing this.

                      Uh-uh.

You're right.
We can't.

 Not from New Jersey.

We have to move
to Los Angeles.

            What?
L.A. is where the business is.

If I'm not there,
I'm, I'm not in the game.

                      The game?
           What game, Brittany?

      Ma, I did not take
 all of these acting classes

      just to sell cereal.

       I, I want to be
       a real actress.

   SHARON: <i> I know, you've</i>
 <i> wanted it your whole life,</i>

         but you are a teenager.

     Okay, you, you can do this
 professionally when you're 18.

Ma, you don't get it.
Okay.

( GIGGLES ) Eighteen is like
the retirement age in Hollywood.

 The right time is now.

              Be real, Brittany.

<i> We can't just pick up and...</i>
  <i> and move across country.</i>

                  We don't even
            know a soul in L.A.

            Honey, listen to me.

          Seriously,
 what is keeping us here, Ma,

          as long as
     we have each other?

You could always
sell your china from there.

                 Cookware.

All right. Come on.

What difference does it make
if we are poor in New Jersey

       or in Los Angeles?

       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

We agreed that we would
try it here for six months.

Are you even
listening to me?

         ( GIGGLES )
          Yes, okay.

                You were saying
            that you were ready

           to cut bait and run,
                   and I'm not.

           ( SIGHS )

Look, this world that
we are trying to live in

is not working out for us, okay?

 We, we need a reality check.

( SIGHS )

                    ( GIGGLES )
                          Okay.

               Well right here,
  there's a guest-starring role

             on<i> Murphy Brown</i> .

                Brittany Murphy
          on <i> Murphy Brown</i> --

         you tell me
that that is not meant to be.

      ( STATIC ON T.V. )
         ( LAUGHTER )

                  Worse than if
        we had taken that line!

            Oh...
   ( indistinct ) funnier.

Stop it!
It was hilarious.

Your timing is perfect.

        Mom, you are my mother.
    You, you've gotta say that.

          ( GIGGLES )

I am so proud to see
my baby girl on TV,

 not even selling anything!

          ( LAUGHTER )

         You still think I need
            that reality check?

                        I mean,
         I've got an agent now,

         I've got a regular gig
           on<i> Drexell's Class.</i>

        It's actually happening.

For so long nothing,
and now it's just going so fast.

           Welcome to Hollywood.

           ( SIGHS )

       You're either up
       or you're down.

    There is no in-between.

   Joanie and Tosh say hi,
         by the way.

      Everyone at school
    is watching your show.

    It's like Jersey girl
   makes good or something.

          BRITTANY:
   <i> Well, the show is okay.</i>

       <i> I'm not really</i>
   <i> where I want to be yet,</i>

        but at least we got out
      of that crappy apartment.

        I just bought a house...

            No way!

      Oh my God, a house?

                    You totally
            have to come visit.

                 Maybe your mom
      will let you stay awhile.

                  Everyone here
         is beautiful like you.

         ( GIGGLES )
         Yeah. True.

   I could never get a boy
       like that, or...

I could never get
a boy like that.

Which one?
Which one's better?

     Oh, I don't know, sweetie.
            They're both great.

             Ma, you're totally
               not helping now.

      Look, I only get one shot!

 Brit, you're putting

way too much pressure
on yourself, okay?

   <i> I mean, i-if you don't</i>
       <i> get this role,</i>

      <i> you'll go back to</i>
       <i> Sister, Sister</i>

and, and you might even
get your own TV show.

You have options now.

                    Sitcoms are
            really fun and all,

    but if I got <i> Clueless</i> ...

If you got <i> Clueless </i> what?

The world wod
open up to you?

Everyone would love you?
You'd be famous?

What is this
really all about?

    I am telling you, Shad,

              it's all I can do
     to talk to any youse guys.

          I could nevah get a...

 Thank you.

          Uh, I have
 two more speeches prepared.

We've heard enough.

 Thank you.

  I could play it straight,
 uh, more heartfelt, earnest.

 Oh, that won't be necessary.

        ( PHONE RINGS )

       Murphy residence.

        Yes, she's...
        Hold on, okay?

                     One second.

                     Your agent.

           Hey, Rick.

  RICK ON PHONE: <i> Brittany,</i>
<i> I just talked to the producers.</i>

        <i> They loved you.</i>

            What?

     <i> You got the part!</i>

      Are you kidding me?

  <i> No, I'm not kidding you.</i>

    <i> You have the part, kid.</i>

         Okay, okay.

      We'll talk Monday.

      Thank you.

             Oh!
            What?

            I freaking got it--
                     <i> Clueless.</i>

                I'm going to be
           in a real movie, Ma.

          ( GIGGLES )

Calm down, calm down,
remember your heart.

Sh-h-h-h!

   Whew.

My baby girl's
going to be a movie star.

           ( SCREAM )

          ( LAUGHTER )

      Cut, print that one.
  Let's keep the breaks at 10.

     <i> 've got to finish</i>
 <i> the montage sequence today.</i>

     That was totally fun.

          ( GIGGLES )

         Yeah, I know
    it's a makeover scene,

 but man, it's going to take
  a whole lot of making over

for that chunky monkey
to look even halfway decent.

          ( WHISPERS )

            Oh, there's my girl.

                    Ready to go?

          BRITTANY:
     <i> She's so beautiful.</i>

                   Yeah, she is.

                But so are you,
       just in a different way.

                     Come on.

                 Don't say that.

                 I am perky.
                 I am fun.

 And what is wrong with that?

             They didn't cast me

     because I'm tall and blond
                and super sexy.

They cast me because they think
   that I'm pathetic enough

           that even a makeover
                  can't fix me.

What the hell?
Where is this coming from?

 Oh, honey.

Look, I know you don't have
a lot of experience with boys,

but that's not the kind of
attention you want.

                     Mom, don't.

You are my beauty.
You are so beautiful...

          ( GIGGLES )

And most importantly,
over there is Cast Services.

 That's where we all eat.

        This is like so surreal.

                I can't believe
             this is your life.

Oh, I want you
to meet someone.

Alicia, this is uh,
this is my best friend Morgan.

She's out visiting.

               Love your dress.
                       So cute.

      Oh, my gosh, thanks.

         So hey, some of us are
      going out after the wrap.

   You should totally bring her.

               We're so totally
    going out with them, right?

Oh, I mean, you can
if you want, you know,

but I've got my acting
and my dance classes, so...

                     Seriously?
   You're still taking classes.

         You've already made it.

I'm not like
Alicia and you, okay?

I can't just get by
on my looks.

I have to bring it
with actual skill.

                    ( GIGGLES )
               The anniversary.

          Yeah.

            Can you believe it?
          It's been four years.

 I can't, really.

                      You okay?
      What's going on with you?

Nothing. Just thinking about
where all the time goes.

                  Just thinking
               about time, huh?

          ( GIGGLES )

           Shut up!
     Come on, I know you.

        What's wrong?
           You do.

You know, there is something
I want to talk to you about.

                Okay.

I've been waiting
for the right time, but...

if there is one really.

           ( SIGHS )

So, last week
I had a doctor's appointment

and they found a lump,
but it's not a big deal

because they're, you know,
they caught it early enough.

            Um, it's not cancer?

                Oh my God! What?

Look, I'm going to,

I'm going to take care
of everything.

               No, I, I need to
        take care of you, okay?

             You are all I have.

      I've got to quit my movie.

             No.
            Yeah.

No.
That's just ridiculous.

       I need to be there, okay.

No, what you need
is to follow your dreams,

 sweetie, please.

         to share it with, huh?

You know, I've done
like 10 films since <i> Clueless,</i>

 and for some reason,

that is the only one
that people always go back to.

What is it going to take for me
to get a real part, Jackie,

 not just some comedic sidekick

or running away
from a serial killer,

but I need something showy.

You know, something
to really prove myself.

I keep hearing about
this Janis Joplin pic.

                           Yep.
         I already pitched you.

            The director thinks
          you're way too young.

I know I could pull it off
if he just gave me a shot.

Please, Jackie.

This is my chance
to stand out,

for people to finally
take notice of me--

not, not just critics,
but people.

 I need it.

                     Okay.

           It's not that you're
                just too young.

        They want to play Janis
                as heroin-chic.

You mean waifish?

Skinny.

      I'm having a party
     at a loft downtown.

     The director will be there.

  Maybe you could come by and...

 Seriously?

Jackie, don't mess with me.

( GIGGLES )
Really?

Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

I am going to
make this happen.

              Yes.
         Mark my words.

          Okay. Okay.
              Yes.

          So, Elliot,

        I was thinking
   of making some changes.

      ( CAMERA FLASHING )

         Sorry, uh, do you mind?

         ( GIGGLES )
         No, I don't,

   but I'm thinking Jackie
might be a little disappointed

if she's got nothing but
a truckload of Janis pictures.

                      ( SIGHS )
                  Right. Sorry.

           I'm, I'm not usually
       the creepy stalker type.

              Hm.

                It's just, I'm,
     I'm such a huge, huge fan.

        Of Janis Joplin?

             Of Brittany Murphy.

          Oh, really?

                         SIMON:
                    <i> Seriously.</i>

    Uh, <i> Cherry Falls</i> ,
    <i> Trixie, Prophecy II.</i>

          You were terrifically
        miscast in all of them.

         ( GIGGLES )
          Excuse me?

               SIMON: <i> No, no.</i>
               <i> I'm, I'm sorry.</i>

                   It's just uh,

  I thought if I was honest
 about your not-so-good work,

       you'd believe me
         when I said

<i> how remarkable everything else</i>
    <i> you've done has been.</i>

   Are you actually for real?

                    ( GIGGLES )
           Um, is it, uh, okay.

  Yeah.

                         Wow.

 I can't believe I'm talking to
      Brittany freaking Murphy!

               I pulled strings
     to get this gig, you know,

                  to be amongst
        the movers and shakers.

What are you doing
wasting your time with me?

You should probably go
move and shake.

                     Right, yes.

               I, uh, I suppose
     I should snap a few photos

       of the rest of the party.

                      All right.

( GIGGLES )
Hey, what's your name?

                 Oh, I'm sorry.
          Simon, Simon Monjack.

Stop apologizing,
Simon Monjack.

                   Right. Sorry.

               Uh, did it again.

          ( GIGGLES )

       Nice to meet you.

          ( GIGGLES )

You're helping out,
remember.

          Oh, yeah.
   Here, drink some water.

I got a phone call.
Hang on.

         Okay. Great.
        Take a break.

 Hey, Jackie.

<i> Seriously?</i>

Okay, okay.

 Yeah, all right.

 I'll call you later.

     Bye.

                     What is it?

The Janis Joplin project...

                      Yeah?

They had to put it on hold--
music rights issue.

                       ( GASP )
           I'm so sorry, honey.

Um, but the director,
he really liked me...

                    Yeah.

So, he's going to put me
in his next movie.

                     Good.

 It's the lead!

                            Oh?
      Starring Michael Douglas.

        ( CROWD NOISE )

  INTERVIEWER: Brittany, hi.
             Hi.

            Quite a performance
       in <i> Don't Say a Word</i> .

      Oh, oh, thank you so much.

              So now what about
            all this Oscar buzz

 that we've been hearing about?
            How does that feel?

  ( GIGGLES ) I don't even know
        what to say about that.

 Your necklace is so beautiful,
                    by the way.

         ( GIGGLES )
          Thank you.

                  Uh, Brittany,
 you're not known for being big

on the Hollywood party circuit.

                 What do you do
            in your spare time?

               Really, actually
             I'm pretty boring.

   <i> I just like to stay at home</i>
     <i> and hang out with my mom.</i>

           She's my best friend.

             She's actually
             right over there.

Marshall is nothing
like people think.

He's such a sweet
and gentle guy.

And by the way,
he's a really great actor.

                     Oh, really?

                     Well, now,
        what about these rumors

          of an off-set romance
              between you guys?

         Oh, come on.
         ( GIGGLES )

            This house is where
              Justin Timberlake

        and Britney Spears live.

Okay, so are we having
tea with them or something?

                    ( GIGGLES )
                            No!

       Actually they're selling
                and I'm buying.

     SHARON: ( WHISTLES )
  <i> We're finally seeing you</i>

for the gifted actress
that you are.

     They are finally seeing me
            for my inner blond.

        Let's be real.
        Stop it, okay?

I'm not going to let you
sell yourself short anymore.

<i> That's enough.</i>
 You know, I don't care.

I am here
and I am not going anywhere.

I don't care how blond
or tall I have to be.

              Anyway, I love it
  and what I love about it most

is that it's right
over the hill from Sherman Oaks,

  so I can come and see my girl
             as much as I want.

  Uh, no.

 Ma, you are moving in with me.

         Baby, I love you, I do,

       but it's time for you to
   establish your independence.

Do you seriously want me
to move into this huge house

 all by myself?

               I want you to be
               your own person.

                     I want you
     to balance your checkbook,

      I want you to drive a car.

        I mean, maybe even date.

 Okay, all right, fine.

If you're not
moving in with me,

I guess I'm not
buying this house.

                    Oh, stop it!

                    Oh, you.

          ( LAUGHTER )

            Yeah?
            Yeah.

            Yeah?
            Yeah!
     Just go see inside.

          ( LAUGHTER )

 Another bad one?

                             No.

                     It's good,
          it's just not for me.

        It's totally male-driven

             and I'd be playing
                the girlfriend.

                        Again.

Can I ask you a question?

                     Uh-hm.

How much success is enough?

            We're talking about
            money, not success.

     You want me to stand
     on my own two feet,

well, that's what I want
for me, too.

Only on screen.

   I just worry that it'll
  never be enough, Brittany.

           ( YAWN )
        Good morning.

                    Morning.
<i> Good morning.</i>

<i> Still jet lagged, Morgan?</i>

    I'm still getting lost
between my room and the kitchen.

       You got any bacon?

          TOGETHER:
             No.

           ( SIGHS )

         What is this?

          BRITTANY:
    <i> It's a kale smoothie.</i>

       It's really good.

I think I'll just get
something when we go out.

 Are we still going shoppin'?

Yeah, sure.

Great.
I'll get changed.

         Uh, di-di, do.

              Oh.

I'm just having such a hard
time relating to her now.

 It makes me sad.

      People change, grow apart.

                        I mean,
          it's hard to maintain

        a childhood friendship,
                      you know.

 Yeah, but I have to.

          She's home.

           MORGAN:
    <i> What about this one?</i>

               Uh, I'm not sure
             that's your color.

     But you could still try it.

          Brittany,
       you're gorgeous.

Huh! You are...

                     Oh my God,
           I so want your life!

          Hey, guys.
      How are you today?

       It's Simon, right?

            SIMON:
            Right.

      Well, ( GIGGLES ),
        come in here.

          Come say hi.

           All right.

           Excuse me.

       But, hello there.

                     Hey.

      Um, Guys, can you
      give us a minute?

 Lucky man.

            Thanks.

Uh, you know, those lads,
they're not your friends.

I know that because
they're mine.

           I'm nice to you guys
       so you'll be nice to me.

       Right.

     That's what you call
 a co-parasitic relationship,

      but never mind that.

   I honestly can't believe
   that you remembered me.

You were quite memorable.

                             Oh.

      Well, uh, for the record,
  you look absolutely gorgeous.

           ( SIGHS )

( GIGGLES )
Come on.

Whatever happened

to that brutal honesty
thing of yours, huh?

                      All right.

                   If I'm being
            completely honest--

 I don't think that you need to
               remake yourself.

   You're so much more than
  blond hair and eyelashes.

I'm not quite sure
how to take that.

 It's just how I get noticed.

             But that's just it.

         Don't you see, I think
      that you shine, Brittany.

        You've nothing to prove.

( GIGGLES ) It was really
good to see you, Simon.

           Likewise.

     But, Brittany, I'm serious
     about these guys out here.

                    They're not
          all charming like me.

          ( GIGGLES )

 They love to build you up now,
           but when they turn--

and trust me, they will turn--
they'll do it with a vengeance.

You're sweet.

          Bye, guys.
       Have a good day.

          ( GIGGLES )

 JACKIE: "<i> Just Married"</i> ,
       <i> it's a comedy.</i>

BRITTANY: <i> I don't want to do</i>
 <i> another silly comedy, okay.</i>

 I'm finally being recognized
    as a dramatic actress.

   I, I, I just need a lead.

                   It is a lead.

                 Equal footing,
              co-starring role.

 Well, who's the co-star?

                 Ashton Kutcher.

Who's that?

                       The dude
         "where's my car?" guy.

                            Yes.

Oooh, uh, he has a TV show,
doesn't he?

       Yes, <i> That '70s Show</i> ,
         and it's very popular.

Well, do you think
they have, say,

acting chops
to make Brittany look good?

     I met him a few times.

        He seemed nice.

                He's very pretty

    which makes me wonder about
    our chemistry a little bit.

          You being
          the beast.

       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

     It's live, gentlemen.

   Get something good, okay?

Hey, Ashton.
How'd it go in there, man?

                      Hey, guys.

Oh, come on.
Give us something, man.

       You're killing me.

         Oh, Brittany.

Hey, are you and Ashton
an item off set too?

Don't believe
everything you guys publish.

                    Oh come on,
    you guys are wearing rings.

            What?
  Oh, they're for the film.

   They were just having fun.

      And so you're uh,
      you're not dating?

Take a look at him.

He could break
any heart in Hollywood.

          ( GIGGLES )

      You're so beautiful.

          ( GIGGLES )

            Shut up!

 No, I'm serious.

                   Hm.

             What are you doing?

                           What?

Do you ever take
this stuff off?

        You would run
        for the hills.

Whoa, we already
are in the hills.

But, yeah,
you're totally right.

I would run.
I'd run.

                          What?
                   That's mean.

          ( GIGGLES )

             <i> Whoa!</i>

      <i> This power couple</i>
     <i> just got nominated.</i>

    What? Really?

            Yeah.
          For what?

     For a Razzie Award--
   worst on-screen couple.

    Oh, that's just mean.
          Oh my God!

It's actually
kind of hilarious.

I mean, the movie made
a truckload of money,

so the Razzie people
can suck it.

Well, you may have
just killed my career,

but we must have run
on that together, huh?

            Yeah.
            Yeah.

                   Question is,
      what are we going to wear

       to the acceptance speech?

             Oh, there's always
       a pair of Oompa Loompas.

                   Now come on,
         let's get out of here.

   I want to go do something.

Yes.
You guys go outside.

 It is a beautiful day.

      <i> You could go hike</i>
        <i> in the hills.</i>

          TOGETHER:
     We are in the hills.

               Oh, that's gross!

          ( LAUGHTER )

          I'm gonna get dressed.

     Oh, okay.

Oh, I'll never get tired
of this view.

Reminds me of when my mom and I
first moved down here

    and we had all those dreams.

                    ( GIGGLES )
                Beautiful, huh?

            Yeah.
            Yeah.

      Oh.
      Okay, all right.

                         Oh, no.

     You got it, guys.

 Wow, okay.

             Yeah.

Whoa, you okay?

             Yeah.

     Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

      It's just a little
    dizzy spell, you know.

                     It'll pass.

You're all right.
You sure?

     It always does, yeah.

ASHTON:
<i> All right.</i>

      ( BRITTANY LAUGHS )

      Okay. I completely do not
        understand this ritual.

 Neither does my mom,

but I still drag her here
every year.

                    Yeah, well,
    it's actually kind of nice.

         We get some alone time.

Oh, oooh, except for
everybody staring at you.

          They're staring at us.

( GIGGLES )
Thanks, Steph.

                 Let's see here
                   what we got.

      Um, I ordered this burger
           with extra grease...

      ( BRITTANY GIGGLES )

     I'm sorry!

          ( LAUGHTER )

 Who keeps texting?

                   Oh, the guys.

    They want to know if we can
        go out with them later.

   Out where?

                   I don't know.

        Dancing, clubs
        or something.
             Hm.

     Should I tell them
     we're coming?

Oh, not me.

I've got to
get back to Mom.

                          Okay.
                Well, can I go?

    I mean, I haven't seen
    my friends in months.

Yeah, sure.

    ( SHOES DROP ON FLOOR )

     I didn't know if you
    were gonna come back.

Why wouldn't I?

               Did you have fun?

       It would've been
        a lot more fun

      if you were there.
       Hm. ( GIGGLES )

  Everybody asked about you.
             Hm.

      Yeah, why do I doubt that?

    My friends all love you.

I just, ( SIGHS ),
I don't understand.

What happened to us between
when we first hooked up and now?

We were having fun.

I mean, now it's like we go
to some greasy spoon diner

and get the blue plate special
and then pass out.

      ( SIGHS ) We were playing
          newlyweds in a movie.

      ( GIGGLES ) Okay, that is
      like doing a reality show

              and then thinking
            that the real world

        is going to be the same.

All right.
Well, look,

all I know is
that I want to be a part

of whatever world
you're a part of, okay?

                 Okay. I'll try.

       You know I have
        two more weeks

               before I have to
            go off to New York.

Then we better not
waste a second, huh?

         ( GIGGLES )
            Yeah.

             Mama?

   SHARON:<i> Hi, baby girl.</i>
    <i> I'll be right there.</i>

 There's my beauty.

 I'm so glad you're home.

                       Hm.

Why didn't you call me?
I would have picked you up.

             Mwah!

    The studio sent a car, so...

Oh, but where's Ashton?

           Uh, well, we decided
              to call it quits.

         Oh, sweetie,
        I'm so sorry.

         What happened?

    ( SIGHS ) We were just
   too different, you know?

    I like to stay at home.

   Sweetie, let me make you
   something to eat, okay?

              <i> That's fine, Mom.</i>

       Brittany?

Hi.

             Hi.
        What happened?

 You fainted.

( SIGHS ) Um, the doctor said
it was a combination of

hypoglycemia
and chronic anemia,

probably from the horrible
periods that you have.

       It's not my heart murmur?

No, no, no, no.

We're just going to have you
eat much more frequent meals

throughout the day,

get you
some iron supplements.

             Hi.
        BRITTANY:<i> Hi.</i>

                  My God, Brit.
      You gave us such a scare.

              Oh, girl, I know.
                  I, I am fine.

                What's going on?

The tabloids know
you're here.

                I just fainted.
                       What...?

      No. Get out of here!

              Sorry. I don't do
     that kind of work anymore.

      I tried to warn you, Brit.

      they're not your friends.

       I can't believe
   what people are saying.

   Is Brittany a drug addict?

    I have never been so famous.

                   <i> Or infamous.</i>

Sweetie, you don't have to
read this trash, okay?

Just focus on getting better.

Don't listen to those idiots.

             I just had no idea
       people could be so mean.

They smelled blood
in the water

and they attacked,
just like sharks.

                           Yeah.

I honestly thought
that those guys were my friends.

        I should have
   just listened to Simon.

     looking out for me.

          how are you doing now?

    Much better.
    Thank you.

    As you know, some have said
      that it was drug-related.

I have never taken drugs.

I, I couldn't
even if I wanted to

because I have
this heart condition.

                     Yes, but...

I'd, I'd really much rather

just talk about
my movie projects.

    what do you have coming up?

I'm about to start a film
called <i> Little Black Book</i> .

I'm really excited about it
because I get to sing

 and then I'm doing a voice

in an animated feature
called<i> Happy Feet</i> .

I get to sing in that, too.

Some gossip reporter has blogs
that a well-known actress

got loaded out of her mind
at a Hollywood party

and had sex with the
cater waiter in the stairwell.

They're saying
that it was me.

I don't know whether to laugh
or cry at the idea

that I left your hospital room
to go out and get loaded

and have anonymous sex.

    we're going to call Jackie,

       and she will know how to

  I'm no longer a photographer.

               Well, other than
           for my own pleasure,

but I've had a bit of success
as a producer and screenwriter.

         I've just had the film
                  <i> Factory Girl</i>

        released this last year,

and that inspired me to write
this script about Sigmund Freud.

Which I loved,
by the way.

              Thank you so much.

                   To be blunt,
  I want you for the lead role,

      for the opera singer here.

          ( COUGHING )

                  You all right?

Uh, she's a wonderful character,

and I love to sing,
but I'm sure you know

that it's impossible to raise
money on my name anymore.

            Well, you just need
                 a fresh start.

   We'll find the money somehow.

         The most important part

    is to find the right person
                  for the role,

     and I know that that's you.

Wow, I appreciate
your vote of confidence in me,

but why do you think that I'm
so perfect for the part?

             Your vulnerability.

       I know you normally play
       much tougher characters,

       but I see the vulnerable
 Brittany hiding inside of you.

     That's the Brittany I want.

turning point for me.

   that you saw me.

            and we'll talk more
       when you get back, yeah.

               Thank you, Simon.

Sharon, I know this must
all seem rather sudden to you.

       That's an understatement.

             You know, Brittany
        is extremely vulnerable

          and fragile right now.

And you're worried that
I'm taking advantage of that.

I don't blame you
for wondering.

                       Hm.

         Plus, she's always had
      a flair for the dramatic,

                and you've been
    her knight in shining armor

             once before, right?

 Look, I'm no Ashton Kutcher.

I don't have
Hollywood good looks,

but I really do love Brit

and I want to marry her
with all my heart.

            Well, you've gained
                     her trust.

          That's not easy to do
                    these days.

She knows I have
her best interest at heart.

    If you do, could you please
          slow this train down.

Hm, I've tried.

Believe me, I've tried.

Can I help it if she finds me
so irresistible?

          ( LAUGHTER )

         Look, I'm sure you know

 that Brittany is famously tied
           to my apron strings,

     but we are a package deal,

Sharon, I would have it
no other way.

of ways to
reboot your career.

to love you again, you know.

To see you
the way that I do.

                  is too small.

we should only invite friends

 who've been loyal.

        No, I'm not looking for
     a picture or an autograph,

               just to warn you.

        Simon Monjack?

        Is this really
    any of your business?

     How well do you know
     Mr. Simon "Conjack"--

     I mean, that's what
     my friends call him.

                Has he told you
      about his other fiancÃ©es,

      the broken hearts
       he's left strewn

                  on both sides

Ooh, I assume
that you're one of them.

it's a good idea...

       <i> Get out of here.</i>

                  No, not until
            I've said my piece.

          That's okay.

                Has he told you
            about the lawsuits,

              the unpaid bills,
      rent he's skipped out on?

                       At least
            talk to his family.

     SHARON: <i> Leave now!</i>
           Ask them

     how he went through
      all of their money

              before he started
       bilking everyone else's.

Simon is a manipulative con man
who victimizes trusting people.

 You need to know that.

 And get that ring appraised.

It is a cubic zirconia,
for sure.

 I'm sorry.

              God.

     I don't want to do horror.

               It creeps me out.

I know, but dear,
we have to start somewhere,

     rebuilding you.

To do that, I need you
to trust me.

       Something's wrong?

                  Nope, nothing.

                 I just want to
      get through this tonight.

          The script
    you don't want to do.

          All right.
          I give in.

     What is it?

        I-I'm just really tired
                        I think

     from all the wedding plans.

               Okay? Good night.

                    Love you.

    Love you, too.

 Thank you.

  Uh, I'm a lightweight on that.

           All right.

      So whose deal is it?

                         Yours,
               you know I suck.

       All right, great.

       ( DOORBELL RINGS )

                    I'll get it.

    ( DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN )

                       Yes?

Murphy residence?

                      It, it is.

US Department of Immigration
and Customs Enforcement.

<i> Is there a Simon Monjack</i>
<i> living here?</i>

Um, it's all right, Brit.
What's this about?

      You have the right
      to remain silent.

             You have the right
                to an attorney.

            Mom, Mom! Si-Simon,
              what's happening?

       Brittany, get me
         an attorney.

  I'll be needing a good one.

    This is a private residence.

      We have a warrant.
         A war-- Ma.

      SIMON: <i> Brittany,</i>
      <i> call an attorney.</i>

  Where are you taking him?
  Where are you taking him?

       At least tell me
   where you're taking him.

Look, I'm not
an immigration attorney,

but I can tell you
it's a legitimate arre.

He's been living here
under an expired visa.

  So how do we get it renewed?

It's not that simple,
and even if it were,

there are a lot of other
allegations against him.

   What other allegations, John?

           ( SIGHS )

      John, just tell me.

He's alleged to owe
back rent and other debts

in excess of
half a million dollars.

  So I guess what that woman
   told us was true, Brit.

 It's the tip of the iceberg.

I mean, he was charged with
credit card fraud in Virginia,

though those charges
were later dropped.

                    Which means
          they may not be true.

Which means
the charges were dropped.

      He knows a lot of people,
                          okay.

              He, he, he's been
           rebooting my career.

       I read a script
        that he wrote.

Look, it is true that he has
an executive producer title

and story-by writing credit
on a film,

but he had to sue
to get them.

So I can't say
how legitimate those are.

You are not the first person
he's done this to.

<i> He's a true genius.</i>

<i> He just happens to be</i>
<i> a genius con man.</i>

Brittany,
I've got to ask,

I mean, you're young,
beautiful, wealthy, famous.

I mean, how'd you get tangled up
with a character like Monjack?

 Just tell me what I have to do
                to get him out.

Brit, I don't know.

I think I need to explain

some of the things
that you've heard

and then I'll get my things
if you want.

           I don't want to hear
                     any of it.

          I just want to fix it.

           Mazel tov!

          ( APPLAUSE )

            SHARON: <i> Everyone,</i>
         <i> I'd love to introduce</i>

                       Brittany
             and Simon Monjack,

                      soulmates
         and partners for life.

          ( APPLAUSE )

<i> What is it?</i>

        They found out.

           Who?

                      <i> Everyone.</i>

  Simon, I wanted to control
when we announced our marriage,

          but someone leaked it.

             When I was younger,

    all I wanted was for people
        to pay attention to me.

       Now, oh God, I just wish
     they would leave me alone.

                      Oh God!

You just need to take it
in stride, all right?

Fight back
when the time is right.

   They're saying you cast
    a spell on me and Mom.

  Maybe I have.

Honestly,
you must be a bit crazy.

It's the only way to explain
why you'd want to be with me.

                   Besides Mom,
          you were the only one

           that I knew for sure
     loves me without question.

           ( SIGHS )

     I, I know you don't
      want to hear this,

               but I want to be
           100% honest with you

     because I, I really
      want this to work.

Simon, don't.

           <i> All of those dirty,</i>
     <i> horrible, terrible things</i>

        <i> you've heard about me--</i>

                  they're true,
        every last one of them.

I guess you could say I've been
    a bit of a sociopath.

 That doesn't matter, okay?

 Hey, the past is the past.

                Right.

        Right, that's the point.

              When I'm with you,

         you make me want to be
                  a better man,

                   and with you
               I will be, I am.

                 From now on...

            let me protect you,
                     all right?

    No more, no more blogs
   or tabloids, all right.

          Let's shut the haters
              out of our lives.

And the fake friends.

              Fake friends, too.

           Stand up.

         Ah, gorgeous.

         There we are.

         Oh, darling,
     I love dressing you.

    ( HELICOPTER WHIRRING )

Why won't they
leave me alone?

Just get...
make them go away.

            Honey?
             Hm.

Got some lunch for you.

                   Uh-uh.

                 No. Not hungry.

Oh, you have to
eat something.

Brittany,
it's not healthy for you

to just lay around here
all day.

Did you take your medicine?

                    Yeah, yeah,
                    I think so.

( SIGHS )
These antidepressants

don't seem to be working
that well anymore.

I'm going to call
the doctor back.

             No, Ma. No doctors.

                     Please, Ma.

    ( DOOR BANGING SHUT )
 SIMON: <i> See! I've done it!</i>

   <i> I finally made it happen.</i>

        You, my dear,
      have got a movie.

           I know.
      <i> Happy Feet Two</i> .

       I can't wait...
         No, no, no.

     Wait, what is this?
         No, no, no.

This, this is a thriller,

small budget
but very, very good.

We leave for Puerto Rico
in a week's time.

So...

        But Puerto Rico.

                   Simon, baby,
         you know I hate flying

             and over the water.

I know, I know,
but it's all right.

We'll both be with you--
your mom and I.

I'll be doing your hair
and makeup for the film.

We'll make a vacation of it,
all right?

Just read the script.

            No, I don't have to.

                     I could...
           I just want to work.

That's my girl.

We missed one or two times

  while Brittany was shooting,

   but we always came back
      to make up for it.

                      Yeah.

 It's exactly the same.

                      ( SIGHS )
             Nothing's changed.

          ( GIGGLES )

          BRITTANY:

          You just don't see it.

Why don't you mind your
own business and bugger off.

 Come here.

        What are you doing here?

It's the one time a year
I know where to find you guys.

                    Uh, join us.

 Uh, I'd love to.

I can't stay very long.

I'm actually producing
a pilot for a TV show.

           SHARON:
      <i> Congratulations.</i>

               That's wonderful.

          BRITTANY:
        <i> Good for you.</i>

Thank you.
Yeah, we're actually

in the casting process
right now

 and your name came up.

<i> I think you'd be great for the.</i>

Thanks, mate,
but we're um,

<i> we're just now rebooting</i>
<i> Brittany's future career.</i>

Don't think it's quite time
to go back to TV.

Well, I hope
you'll think about it

<i> because you'd be great.</i>

                      Of course
         she'll think about it.

                   Ashton, wait.

        Wait a second.
         ( GIGGLES )

 Hey, Brittany.

 How are you?

Are you...
Are you okay?

                 Yeah.

                       You know
              you can't believe

                  all the stuff
       that you hear out there.

     Yeah.

                  And, I'm good.

               We're good.

You know, I never stopped
caring about you.

You know that, right?

                   Yeah. Me too.

              But I have my Mom,

                      and Simon
         really cares about me.

Yeah, of course, right.

                    Hey...

     do you think if we had won
       that Razzie, ( GIGGLES )

     <i> if we would have shown up</i>
     <i> to accept it in person...</i>

      Definitely.

  Take care of yourself, okay?

              There's gunshots.
       I can hear the gunshots.

What do you want?

             Huh?
     SIMON: <i> Brit, Brit.</i>

              Do you hear that?
       Simon, do you hear that?

It's just a car backfiring.

                    ( YELLING )
                Leave us alone!

       Brittany, stop.
           Stop it.

       Leave me alone!
       Brittany, stop.

        It's just a car.

       <i> So basically the bangs</i>

       were just a generator
       misfiring.

It's from all those
bloody power outages.

      I heard gunshots.

            <i> I did.</i>

     Ma'am, is there any reason
             that you'd believe

                 <i> someone would</i>
             <i> want to harm you?</i>

Darling, you're safe,
all right?

No one's going to hurt you.

Thank you so much,
officer.

Sorry for your trouble.

                     Okay.

          You folks try to have
                a good evening.

 You too.

                    Here.

What, what is that?

       It's just a beta blocker.

These are your heart pills?

       Yes. It'll calm you down.

I'm so embarrassed.

          Brit, there's no need
             to be embarrassed.

       I'm right here,
          all right?

          You're safe.

                     I'll never
               leave your side.

         ( WHISPERS )
         You promise?

                      I promise.

          I'm sorry.
             Oh.

            SIMON:
          <i> Wake up.</i>

        Is she sleeping?

      No, uh, we'll need
     another five though.

     It's just the jet lag.

Yeah, yeah.
Take your time.

                      Thank you.

  Um, it's all right, baby,
     but it is important

that you remember your lines
this time, all right?

 Shall we go over them?

      You told me that this was
        going to be a thriller.

              <i> Simon, I told you</i>

            <i> I don't want to do</i>
          <i> another horror film.</i>

      It's changed a bit
    since I first read it,

        but don't worry,

you are going to be
wonderful in it.

All right?
Promise.

 Just give me a moment.

       It is important
      that we're mindful

        of Brittany's
       mandated breaks.

 Her mandated breaks?

                          Yes.

( LAUGHTER ) You're,
you're kidding me, right?

             No.
            Okay.

We're in Puerto Rico.

 This is not the Fox lot.

          I'm aware of that.

This is an ultra
low-budget film, man.

   I'm well aware of the budget
               of this picture.

I can't get my star
of my movie

to know one line of dialogue
for more than five minutes?

      She knows her lines, okay?

That is when she's
not too busy sleeping.

        Are you drunk?
     Are you kidding me?

        Of course not.
        Simon, please.

                  Of course not.

        It's just how
   unprofessional you are!

I'm calling a wrap
for today, guys.

Uh, we'll pick up
everything tomorrow.

                 You don't need
                    to do that.

<i> Mandated breaks.</i>

She'll be fine
by tomorrow.

It's all right.
We'll go home.

We'll get a bit of rest,
all right?

DIRECTOR:
<i> Good morning.</i>

  BRITTANY: <i> Good morning.</i>
       <i> How you doing?</i>

           Great.
        Good morning.

             Um, there has been
      a slight change of plans.

      You're not allowed
     back on set anymore.

           Uh, what?

           It's, it's all right.

             I'll sort this out.

      She's not going on
      without me, so...

 Hey, that's completely fine,
      and I understand,

 but we don't need her anymore.

 She's been replaced.

 You can't do that!

          Yes, I can.

        I can do that
 because we're making a film.

 Very little time to make it.

      Nobody's going to
    put up with her drama.

How dare you!

    No, let's just go, okay?

  This whole thing has been
    a train wreck anyway.

           Take care.

       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

          ( COUGHING )

             Home.

               Bloody airplanes.

Yeah, now you know
how I feel.

           My head
     is about to explode.

Okay, off to bed
with you two, okay?

 I'm going to make some soup.

          Oh, baby,
  you don't have to do that.

           I insist.

      The least I can do
       is open up a can

  and heat up some soup, huh.

                   It's my turn
           to take care of you.

 I'm worried about her.

She's acting like
nothing happened.

I mean, these mood swings
are getting worse and worse.

        I'll talk to the doctor
          about her medication.

                     Meanwhile,
            off to bed with us.

<i> Survived two bouts of cancer,</i>
    <i> but for some reason,</i>

   she acts like this cold
    is going to kill her.

 Simon?

 What's going on?

 Simon, what's wrong?

Mom, ma, come here!

           SHARON:

       <i> Simon, please!</i>

<i> What-- is he having a seizure?</i>

      No. I don't know.
I think he's having a heart--

  a heart attack or something.

       Help me get him
        on the floor.

   I'm going to perform CPR.

<i> Please, please, no.</i>

I know it was just
a mild heart attack,

but it was quite
the wake-up call.

We have got to
get you in shape.

          ( COUGHING )

         Both of us then, right.

No, it's just a cold.

    I will live.

        That's the spirit, Brit.

      You've been acting
     a bit manic lately.

                  Have you been
              taking your meds?

No, I decided
to go off them.

They make me feel
spacey and stuff.

      Where are you going?

The premiere
for that little film

I did last summer is tonight,
<i> Across the Hall</i> .

Remember?

                  I thought you
              begged out of it.

 That was before I...

When I thought I was going to be
shooting in Puerto Rico,

but now that I am here,

I feel like
I should go support it.

<i> Plus Mama's better enough</i>
<i> to take me, so...</i>

            Oh, I don't like it.

           ( GROANS )

                   But at least
                take your meds.

           ( GROANS )

    A bit of this cold medicine
                 works wonders.

Simon, honey,
you go back to bed.

Okay? You have a fever
and a bad heart.

           So do you.

                 On both counts.

              All right. Look...

Hm?

       I'm not going to let you
         face the wolves alone.

                I'm coming with.

                    Okay?

First, let's find you
something

just a bit different to wear,
all right?

Perhaps you go back to blond.

          BRITTANY:
     <i> And so in that way,</i>

       <i> it already had</i>
      <i> a cult following.</i>

          <i> Good-bye.</i>
       <i> Thanks so much.</i>

           Excuse me, Brittany.
                            Hi.

                Hi. How are you?

 I'm good, thank you.

             Let me ask you.

So with all of these rumors
and innuendos

that seem to follow you,
how do you rise above it?

             High heels.

          ( LAUGHTER )

                        No, no.
                 Um, seriously,

             I have a wonderful
               husband and mom.

    I spend more time with them
             than anybody else.

          They keep me grounded.

     Any plans for the new year?

        I'd like to be
       somewhere cold.

   I miss the winters back East.

           <i> Actually, I do have</i>
      <i> a New Year's resolution.</i>

         I want to have a baby,
                start a family.

            SHARON:
<i> Britt, don't ruin a good night.</i>
     <i> Stay off your phone.</i>

Bloggers are still saying

<i> I was difficult</i>
<i> on the set of "The Caller".</i>

         They fired me.

<i> They're saying</i>
<i> you were drunk, Simon.</i>

<i> People cannot tell</i>
<i> the difference</i>

between a freaking
SNL parody and the truth.

<i> More people</i>
<i> saw that sketch</i>

than my last five films
combined.

         I thought we swore off
   looking at the online trash.

                       <i> Come on.</i>

  How are those cramps, baby?

BRITTANY:
<i> They're worse than ever.</i>

           Oh my God!

             What?

   They're saying I've been
replaced on <i> Happy Feet Two</i> .

<i> They, they can't do that,</i>
<i> right, Simon?</i>

   They can't-- that is all
      I have right now.

        Well, sweetie,
 it's probably not even true.

           No, mom.
   It's all over the place,

        it's everywhere.

       I hate this city.

<i> Maybe it is time</i>
<i> for us to go home.</i>

      I could do Broadway.

  Maybe even some community
     theater if I had to.

Simon, we could
start our family.

 No more anniversary dinners
  at that crappy diner, Mom.

          Let's go.
        Let's get out.

        Are you really
      serious this time?

         I'm on board.

I just want to see you happy,
            right?

      BRITTANY: <i> They won.</i>
  <i> They got what they wanted.</i>

Darling, it's been
almost two weeks.

( SIGHS )
<i> You're only getting worse.</i>

          ( COUGHING )

Here you go, hon.

     Okay.

Sweetie, we need to
call the doctor.

             No.
             Yes.

             No.
        Please, Brit.

             Listen to your Mum.

             No. They will just
         call me a drug addict.

       <i> I don't, please Mom, no.</i>

Okay, then I'm just going to
call him again about it.

I'll be right back.
Yes.

          ( COUGHING )

Here.

 Brit, just take a sip.

          ( COUGHING )

          ( COUGHING )

Brit, Brit.
You sound very bad.

                 We can't let...

             Should we take her
                     to the ER?

         ( COUGHING )
       No, no hospital.

SHARON: <i> Sweetie, we cannot see</i>
   <i> the doctor till Monday.</i>

                   ( COUGHING )
            No! They'll call me
                a junkie again.

           SHARON:
          <i> Sweetie.</i>

          ( COUGHING )

You're all right.

       ( CHOKING NOISES )

      Brittany.

        Sharon.

         ( YELLING )
           Sharon!

 We need your help, Sharon!

             Baby?

I don't know
what she's saying.

             You can't breathe?
                    Okay, okay.

          Sit down.
         ( COUGHING )

    Okay, baby, just sit.
     Brittany, sit down.

        Don't leave me.

    I don't-- I really don't
      feel good right now.

     Just stay with me.
                      Okay.

                 ( indistinct )
      We'll see what we can do.

            Prop up the pillows
      really high so she can...

          ( COUGHING )

  Don't leave me, Mom, don't.

                    No, no, no.
          It's okay. It's okay.

     Just try and relax, please.

              Just try to relax.

                     Just relax.

        ( DOOR CLOSES )

She's still in there?

              Yes.

I got her some tea.

I think we just
need to get all packed up

and get the hell
out of here, right?

        Oh, yeah, I'll fly back,

             wrap everything up.

       ( RUNNING WATER )

            ( THUD )

             Brit?

       ( KNOCK ON DOOR )

                      Brittany,
       I have some tea for you.

          Oh my God!
      ( SHOUTS ) Simon!

       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

           ( HOWLS )

                   Oh my God!
