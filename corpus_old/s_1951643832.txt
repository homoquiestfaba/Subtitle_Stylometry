The Gates of Hell have opened.

Mrs. Pushkina, I am Owen.

I don't know any Owen.

Did you have a good trip?
Yes, thank you.

Hello.
Hi.

Vlad has not come back yet.

I know.

Uriel disappeared.
We're going to look for him.

You won't find him.
They leave no trace.

What do you want?

Tolstoy sent me.
I must take Owen to the river.

You know that there are
demons where we are going?

Your beliefs are yours to keep, Father.

Should we speak with them?
There's no need.  They know who we are.

The problem is not the construction.

The river dried before,
but only in the summer...

but now the subway diverted the river and...

They have destroyed the balance.

The river runs through the passage
that connects their side and ours.

It is the only thing that keeps
the demons away.

He did it with no help from anyone.
Why didn't you go with him?

This way is safer.

Very polite.
But you should go first.

More demons are appearing.

I know.
We have to leave this place.

You know that we cannot.
We have to wait for her.

Besides, we cannot
survive out there.

And we can survive here?

No. To continue, we will have
to get permission first.

What do you mean?

This area does not belong
to Tolstoy's people.

We have to speak with the leader
of the people who control this area.

Tolstoy sent me.
I want to speak with Andrey.

Come with me

They come too.

"First day of our confinement

We hide inside the crypt,
where it is safe.

I have been charged with the
difficult task of keeping them safe.

It is not easy to explain
the situation to them.

Savagery has taken
hold of the city.

But we will be safe here."

"10th day of our confinement
I am still waiting patiently.

At times I am overtaken
by doubts and fear...

but obedience and faith
illuminates my way."

Do not leave here under
any circumstances!

The children could die.

I will send a sister to tell
you when it is safe.

Wait for her; she will bring you
back to us.  God bless you, sister.

You used to be more ruthless. You
never would have let me make it here.

Now we can continue.
They won't stop us.

Why else do you think they
would let us pass?

It would be a good idea...

but they do not cross the river.

You've studied our legends well.

The Gates of Hell have opened.

You do not know where
we have put ourselves!

Here is where they call Hell.

May the power of Christ protect us...

that the demons do not come close to us...

Be careful.
Don't worry.

May the power of Christ protect us,
that the demons do not come close to us...

Where now?
I do not know.

I never come here, and
I don't want to be here.

"13th day of our confinement

The oldest came to me.
Against my orders...

two of them had gone
up to the convent...

and saw the Hell that the
demons left in their wake.

Now they believe me
and our situation...

and will never go up again.

Nobody will leave here
until the Sister comes for us."

I left it there.

I left it against the wall.

More than you can imagine.
I'm getting out of here.

The water is lower now.

We can leave now.

We have to wait for the Sister.
Don't you remember?

She is here. The time has come.

Where is she?

The demons have found her.
How do you know that?

She is different.  She has can see,
and the demons are deaf and blind.

It is as the history says:
She will come in search of them...

and will show the way to them
when the time has come.

The time has come.

"We barely have enough to eat...

but the children are adapting
to this world of shadows.

They have found water and
are catching animals for food."

Ow, fuck!

"I do not know how long
we have been here...

but I know that my time has
come and I can rest in peace.

I fulfilled my mission.
They will wait for the Sister.

The children will not leave.

They know that on the surface
and beyond the river...

there are only demons.

We have not forgotten our history.

Long ago, demons
took over the world..."

"...and the angels will
come down to Hell.

Long ago, they came
to our church...

they set everything on fire
and killed the faithful..."

We should save her.
Why is she tied?

She may be evil.

She seems like a demon...

She is the Sister, that one that
will show the exit to them.

The Elder will decide.

We have to let her go and follow her.

She seems like a demon.

I don't care.
If she's a demon, she will kill us.

First she will show the way to them.

If she is the Sister, she
will show the way to them.

She is tied up, she can
show nothing to them.

Well?

The Elder decided that she
was a demon.

She is not the Sister.

You must go, you must
show the way to them.

They captured me as I
was crossing the river.

I do not know. There was nobody
there, I couldn't see anything.

Someone freed me.

From her voice, it was a little girl.
From her breath, it was a monster.

She wasn't alone.  We have to get out of here,
fast.  We should go towards the river.

We don't have a lot of time.

Our time has come.
They follow the Sister.

The girl said that it leads to Hell.

Where's the damn exit?

My God!
