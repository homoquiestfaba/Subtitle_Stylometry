[horns honking]

marie:
when you are alone eternally,

you live for the comfort
of the senses--

food, sex.

i'd become very selective,

and it was getting harder
for me to find food,

even living in the city.

my choosiness about food
cost me my lover,

and without him,
there is no sex.

for six nights,
i have found nothing to eat.

but then came good news.

i was sad.
i was starved.

it was time
to treat myself,

and i thought,

"what about italian?"

don't worry
about the car.

leave the keys in case
we have to move it.

hey, lenny.
how you doing, huh?

all right.

what took you?

i had to dress right.
i had to shave.

he wants you
in on this.

hey, ton, what's
this all about, huh?

watch this.

aah!

aah!


i love that.

place is bugged.

we do business
downstairs.

come on.

see? we come so far down,
we're in china.

sal, how you doing?

i was honored
by your call...

a little surprised.
i didn't think--

have a seat.

so, uh, sal,
what's happening here, huh?

what's this?

it's a...it's a toaster.

it's a toaster oven.

whoa, hey.
it's a nice one.

a lot of buttons.

hit this button...

pops open.

you could put
anything in here--

slice of pizza,
pastry.

you pop it in.

comes out,

the crust is crisp.

[slams oven door]

microwave don't do that.

you ever tried cooking
calzone in a microwave?

it comes out
like a limp dick.


yeah.

korean.

they're getting a big chunk
of the electronics action.

do you know why?

because they fucking steal.

any fucking idea
that ain't nailed down.

you think
some korean asshole

came up
with the toaster oven?

well, here they are,
knocking them out.

where'd it come from?

what, sal?

the toaster?
honestly, i don't know.

you was with leguto.

when leguto fell
off the face of the earth,

you became mine.

then you got this idea

because i just took over,
maybe i'm confused,

maybe i'm letting things
slip through the cracks.

no, sal,
i would never think--

where did it come from?

sal, tell me
what the answer is.

what should i say?

it came from a warehouse.

it came off a truck
from the airport!

a truck you hit
tuesday!

where's my end,
gilly?

i had to take inventory,

make sure you got

a complete cross section
of the merchandise.

i thought this was
just a sit-down.

yeah, but somebody
ain't getting up.

i got a message
for your warehouse guys.

please, god.
sallie, no.

the message is...

don't fuck with me!

sal!

we got eyes on us!

maybe somebody saw
this guy come in here.

what are you saying?
you telling me something?

get rid of him
discreet.

you want discreet?
you fucking shoot him.

ray!

do it!

please, sal, no.
you don't understand.

it's a terrible mistake.
i want to live.

i'll do anything
for you.

please!
please help me!

please, sal.
you don't understand.

gilly,
that's fucking disgusting.

no, please!

don't do it to me!

you don't
understand!

don't do it to me.
don't!

you don't
understand!

fucking die.

next time i tell you
to pull the trigger,

you fucking pull the trigger!

sal, come on, relax.

joe's one of us.

yeah.

ha ha!

this shit's starting
to get to me.

ha ha ha!

yeah.

he does what
he's got to do.

he loves it.
he's fucking sick.

you can't talk like that.

this is war.
we're soldiers.

we kill to protect
what's ours.

here. take this.
it's clean.

i'm good at stealing.
i'm not a shooter.

if you're not a shooter,
you're shot.

bang!

you just can't sit around
and watch anymore.

sal will tell you
to whack somebody,

and you got no choice.

come on.

fucking cops!

hey!

jesus, joey!

aah! ow!

hey, back off!

you think we're
fucking entertainment?

fucking asshole!

oh, shit.

you think we're
fucking mtv?

get out of here!
back off!

yay!
yay!

come on!

what's wrong
with him?

whoa!

fuck, joey!
you don't do that!

what the fuck
am i supposed to do?

you don't do
those things!

take it easy, man!

go home and get
your head straight.

go ahead.

i'm sorry, tony.

oh!

jeez, i'm sorry.

i ruined you.

let me help you.
give me your bag.

put your hand
up here.

i'm really, uh...

i'm sorry
about that.

i didn't
see you there.

marie:
he looked promising.

can i give you
a ride somewhere?

maybe i could buy you
a drink--coffee, hot tea.

you could do
with some warming up.

marie:
he felt promising.

but his eyes were...

sad, so very sad.

my first rule--
never play with the food.

are you sure?

[engine starts]

[tires screech]

[honks horn]

do not touch the car.

do not touch
the fucking car!

marie:
this guy was perfect.

gee, i'm sorry.
don't hurt me, o.k.?

i--i just
got scared.

i could have got
run over.

thank god you've got
good reflexes.

you can really move
for someone so...

big.

look, we're getting soaked.

i'll give you a lift.
where you going?

gee, tony, this is
just so great of you.

i know it's a little
out of your way.

across the fucking
river.

all sinatra?

hey, don't start
on sinatra.

there's this park--
got a great view of the city.

you want to see
a great view, tony?

sinatra: dd that old black
magic has me in its spell dd

dd that old black magic
that you weave so well dd

dd icy fingers
up and down my spine dd

dd same old witchcraft dd

dd when your eyes
meet mine dd

dd the same old tingle
that i feel inside dd

dd and then that elevator
starts its ride dd

very nice.

dd down and down i go dd

hey.

dd round and round dd

hey, yourself.

i can tell
you're excited.

yes.

dd i should stay away,
but what can i do? dd

dd i hear your name,
and i'm aflame dd

not shy, are you?

dd aflame with such
a burning desire dd

dd that only your kiss dd

dd can put out the fire dd

come on, baby.
let's get in the back.

give tony a little room
to get into some motion.

come on.

dd i have waited for,
the mate dd

aah!

what are you,
some kind of a freak?

grrr!

aah!

aah!

grrr!

dd round and round i go dd

dd in a spin dd

dd lovin' the spin
that i'm in dd

dd under that
old black magic dd

dd called love dd

marie:
my second rule--

always finish the food.

that means eliminating
the feed marks

and a central nervous system
disconnect.


oh, that's o.k.

this one has everyone
a little spooked.

standard shotgun hit,
right?

nah. this guy's lost
a lot of blood.

yeah, well, he had
his head blown off.

this guy's really lost
a lot of blood.

it's not here.

decent amount of splatter,
but hardly what you'd expect.

blood should have settled
in his ankles,

turning them purple.

i'd say this guy's
about five quarts low.

what in hell
are you doing out here?

i was with tony
last night.

i heard he got hit.

any of these cops could be
in the mob's pocket.

the damn press is here!

he was a friend.

a friend?

he stood up for me.

without tony, i'd be in
a lot of trouble.

you're not
in trouble, gennaro.

you're gone.
it's over.

what?

i'm putting you
into protection.

morales!

you're kidding me.

mm-mm. you've been
under too long.

look, sinclair--

no. no.
save it, gennaro,

because i'm not listening
to you this time.

you are a danger
to this investigation

and to yourself.

i'm in
total control.

oh? coming here?

that cowboy stunt
last night with the van?

this asshole
was too damn close.

that's bullshit!
i was doing my job!

just get him
out of here!

you cannot
pull me out now.

it's absolutely
the wrong fucking time.

macelli will ask me
to make a hit.

i'm going to tape it
and nail the fucker.

i've lived with them
for three years--

eating, drinking,
stealing.

you've been sitting
behind a desk.

you come here and say,
"that's it. it's over."

it's all i fucking got.

all right. we got
your testimony, your tapes.

you'll get us
macelli, huh?

come on.

miss sinclair!

hi, guys.

this was the first time
my food made the front page.

hey.

thank you.

that fucking pig.
i knew he wasn't right.

sallie,
our problem is--

the problem is,
find joey gennaro.

put two behind
his fucking ear.

don't say that in front
of your attorney.

sinclair will come down
on you with the rico act

and freeze
your assets.

you're afraid
you won't get paid?

that's the least
of my worries.

i'm saying
make arrangements.

yeah. yeah. yeah.

what if i go
right here?

make arrangements,
that's what i'm saying!

make arrangements!

you putz.

who's this?

little girl got lost.

i figured
i'd take her home.

i got my ass
on the grill,

and you can't get
your mind off pussy.

jacko, ain't that the prick
from the papers?

[camera clicking]

yeah.

punch his fucking
lights out.

[tires screech]

ha ha ha!

you dress like a pimp
and talk like a goon.

what makes you news?

excuse me?

she's from out of town.

must be from mars
to talk like that.

nobody calls me pimp.
nobody calls me goon.

since i'm 16,

what people call me
is sallie the shark,

and i pick my teeth
with girls like you.

sal.

you're the dumbest
bitch i ever met,

but you got balls.

want a ride?
you got one.

i should have walked away,
but he annoyed me.

thanks, carmine.
you're wonderful.

maybe i got to
apologize.

my world's going to shit
at the speed of light.

puts me in a mood.

call me sal.

what do i call you?

marie.

oui,marie...

let's make up over
a little late supper.

i'd love a little
late supper,

but it looks like

we're not exactly
alone.

tell me about it.
my guys, the feds,

reporters.

probably some bastards
want to put lead in my head.

lenny, lose them.
the hideaway.

losing them, sal.

ok, stay on your toes.
take me about an hour.

right, sal.

where's the bag?

right here.

oh.
hey, come on.

all right.

come on.

[music plays]

sinatra:
dd i've got you dd

dd under my skin dd

what do you think?

dd i've got you dd

it's you.

i could do without
the bars on the windows,

but what are you
going to do?

the city--it's
a fucking zoo, right?

dd i've got you
under my skin dd

i was going to
eat this

with a colleague
from squirrel hill.

boy, is he
going to be pissed.

prepare yourself
for a little bit of heaven.


none for me, thanks.

hey,mangia, mangia.

you're a good-looking broad,

but a little
meat on the bones

never goes out of style.

mussels and garlic

from munafo's,
for christ's sake.

come on.

i--i do not eat fish.

you're a vegetarian?
ha ha!

well, this is mussels.
they're vegetables...

more or less.

ha ha ha!

uh!

i've got to...

hey, the bathroom
is over there.

this was a mistake.

uh!

oh...

eh...

baby...

anything i can do?

come on, baby.

relax, hmm?

you want to lay down?

uh...

garlic...

garlic
is hard for me.

you ain't italian,
that's for sure.

heh heh!

my eyes
are sensitive.

sensitive.

[breathing heavily]

hey!

mary virgin with me.

i look in your eyes.

some dark alleys.

yeah. heh heh.

mmm.

oh, yeah. give it.

oh, yeah, give it.

grrr!

aah!

grrr!

ah!

sal!

oh, god!


i know i'm a freak
to you guys--

half a crook,
half a cop.

my wife
thought that, too.

she left you,
didn't she?

you'd leave me, too,
if you could.

shh!

[suspenseful music
plays]

aah!

[knock on door]

shh!

uh! ah!

pizza man.


yeah.

...myself.

i stand at attention!

name, dan quayle.

rank--

o.k. thanks.


look, when
things cool down,

you can start
all over.

this shit
won't cool down.

these guys will want
my head forever.

who died?

macelli.

he took a hit
on the north side.

shit.

you made him
look so bad,

his people took him out.
it's justice.

no,
this is impossible.

you still got plenty
of cases against his crew.

big cases.

shit!

excuse me.

i had you nailed,
you son of a bitch.

where's the blood?

pardon?

the carotid artery
was cut, right?

there should be blood
from wall to wall.

well, what
do you think?

my thinking is
the less i say,

the safer my pension.

you found something
under his nails, right?

hair? flesh?

traces of makeup?

perp was a female.

hmm.

what?

his temperature
should be dropping.

yeah?

it's going up.

poor sallie.

he wasn't
such a bad guy.

who was she, lenny?

who was she?

your mother!

come on. let's go.
come on!

you're dead.
you're already dead!

you're
a fucking whore!

break it up!

jesus!

sorry you lost
a client, bergman.

more scum.

my clients are
paragons of honor!

get off me.

so big now, though.

just another hefty bag
enchilada, like the rest.

o.k. you can
take him up.

[door opens]


pardon you.

no, that wasn't me.
it was--

it was him.

it's just gas,

macelli?

macelli's alive!

oh.

[bell rings]

damn it!


oh!

aah!

[tires squealing]

[horn honks]

[horn honks]

that's my car.

man:
petrelli with you?


will you get this car
out of the way?

fuck!

move it!

what's the rush?

macelli's car smashed into
a gas station in shadyside.

what was the meat wagon
doing up there?

macelli was driving.

oh!

uh!

aah!

ugh!

stop!

i said...

ooh!

stop the fucking car!

aah!

ah!

how the hell
do i get to shadyside?

manny...

[glass breaking]

[glass breaking]

turn off
the fucking lights!


...find something
that appeals, god damn it.

son of a bitch!

i'm fucking dying here.

sallie, maybe you
ought to sit down.

no, no. i'm
not sitting down.

i ain't lying down.

last time i laid down,
a fucker tells me i'm dead!

some prick stuck
a thermometer in my kidney.

it must have healed.

it's ok, sal.
it's ok.

let me get you
that drink.

hey...you smell.

oh, i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.

you smell good.

sallie!

we got to talk.

everybody thinks
you're dead--

the cops, the press.

that's right.
it's a fucking plot.

yeah!

somebody tried
to whack me--

the gambinos,
the feds.

they laid me out
in the morgue.

they tried to
saw me in half.

you got to call
a press conference!

you got to sue
those cocksuckers.


huh...


sallie?


i was warming this
for you.

sallie!

sallie, what
the hell happened?

crazy bitch.

she fucking bit me.

we got to get you
a doctor.

mmm!

no, i'm fine.

i just got
this appetite.

mmm.

i'll call a couple
of the boys.

grrr!

grrr!

[horn honks]

you are
in deep shit, lady,

really deep shit.

you're the one that
blew tony silva's head off

and took macelli out.

i'd appreciate it
if you would drive.

who do you work for?

self-employed.

you do this for fun?

for sport?

you do this
for the blood?

you're a cop.
where's your cop radio?

this isn't
my cop car.

i wish you hadn't
jumped on it.

sorry.

macelli's not dead,
is he?

why are you
after him?

to kill him?

why didn't you make
sure he was dead

the first time
you killed him?

[distorted voice]
i fucked up, o.k.?

don't tell me
it never happened to you.

what in hell are you?

i'll find out
where macelli is.

jesus, joe!

macelli's here?
he's alive?

should i
cuff him?

cuff her, for christ's sakes,
but be careful.

she's fast,
and she's strong.

she's the one
who got macelli.

she's a goddamn freak.

she chomped macelli
in the neck

and drained his blood.

she blew tony's head off
to make sure he stayed dead.

look, guys, i'm aware
of how this sounds.

flinton,
be careful. get out!

where'd you find her?

at the church
outside macelli's.

she can climb--

joe, shut up and
listen to yourself.

you got such a hard-on
for macelli,

you figure
whoever iced him

had to be some blood-
sucking superbitch.

i know this whole thing
is crazy.

how did macelli
drive the car?

as far as
i'm concerned,

the medical examiner's
a moron,

and macelli is one
dead son of a bitch.

what happened
to your car?

she, uh...

she jumped on it.

ha ha! god.

put him
in the car, dave.

oh, man.

you'll help me now?

yeah, yeah.

she's got him
eating out of her claw.

you stay put,
or the cuffs go on.

i mean it.

calling me a killer?

the whole time,

he'sdriving
like a maniac!

i mean,
look at this car!

this is unit 5-3.

i need a home address
in shadyside

for a mr. emmanuel bergman.

he's an attorney.

this guy is a cop?

well,
he's been suffering

from job-related
stress lately.

it's about
7 blocks up.

thanks.

sir, could you let me
powder my nose?

oh, yeah. sure!
absolutely.

go ahead.

i am dracula.

oh...

it's really
good to see you.

i don't know
what happened
to the driver

and my luggage
and...

well...

and with all this,
i...

i thought i was
in the wrong place.

i bid you welcome.

[wolves baying]

listen to them.

children of the night.

what music they make!

i swear on my mother,
he was dead,

and this ain't
no improvement.

dracula: a spider
spinning his web

for the unwary fly.

blood is the light,
mr. renfield.


gennaro.

what about
gennaro, sal?

he's here.

what do you mean,
sal?

they probably
stashed that prick

in an underground
bunker somewhere.

dracula:
you'll like it.

renfield:
aren't you drinking?

dracula:
i never drink...

wine.

hey, sal,
wait a minute.

no, sallie!
don't, sallie!

no, sallie!
no, sallie, don't!

the boys will
check it out!

jesus christ!

everything all right?

stevie, uh...

gennaro split.

fuck!

i don't need this.

mmm.

sal! sal!
sal! oh, my god!

don't, sal!
don't kill him here!

boys, boys, help!

help!

sal, listen to me.
you're losing it.

don't murder a cop
on my lawn! sal!

forgive me, sal.

you've got to get
ahold of yourself.

come on.

come inside.

please.

can you believe
this cocksucker?

show up here, huh?

where's the gun?

oh, he's got cuffs!

let's cuff him.

you see, sal?

now that you're inside,

you're in
an excellent situation.

no blood.

even if the cops came

with a search warrant
to talk to macelli,

i'd tell them to get
a ouija board

because he's dead.

there's nothing in
the fucking constitution

clearer than freedom from
unreasonable searches,

and this isn't unreasonable,
it's demented.

the government can't
pronounce a man dead

then invade his home
looking for him.

you really
whacked me,

but there ain't
no blood.

what a guy, manny.

hey, sallie!

manny, i...

i need you.

sal, come on!

you always do for me.

do for me, manny.

it's o.k.

it'll be o.k.

[distorted voice]
do this!

aah!

aah...

woman in movie: the walls
around are bare,

echoing to our laughter,

as though the dead
were there.

man: ha ha!
nice little sentiment!

but there's more,
even nicer.

quaff a cup to
the dead already.

ah-choo!

oh, never mind
the rest, dear!

that son of a bitch
is heavy!

dracula:
to die, be really dead...

that must
be glorious.

woman:
why, count dracula!

there are far
worse things...

awaiting man...

than death.

manny?

manny?

aah!

out light!

you killed him.

nah!

ha!

resting.

he's dead.

they said i was dead.

i ask you--am i dead?


i got this tingle.

there's something
you can do for me.

aah!

this shirt is disgusting.

this fat bastard.
come on!

what's he got,
lead in his ass?

1...2...

3!

ugh!

please! help me!

god! god, please help me!

my manny!
manny, manny, manny!

lenny!

lenny, look!

please help me!

please! help me! help me!

help me!

oh, here's sal!

sal!

come on!

hurry the fuck up.

oh, god, somebody help me!
why don't you help me?

help me!

stop! please stop!

oh!

please stop the car!
help me!

he killed my manny.

he ate my manny!

he wha--he--he...

he killed my manny!

he ate manny!

radio: steve, what's
happening? you find joe?

for christ's sake,
will you talk to me?

come on!

ugh!

i'm going to grind you
down to blood...

and screams.

hey, joey, we're going to
take this nice and slow...

so why don't you
take your shoes off,

get comfortable?

whoa! hey, come on!
no, stop!

hey, come on!

sal, this is going to get
all over my coat.


i want him alive!

hey! hey!

stop, for christ's sake!

son of a bitch.

would you please
help me in the car?

he shot my fucking foot!

oh, shit!

if you had just
left him to me,

i would have stopped him
before he fed.

now he's 100 times
more dangerous.

who did macelli eat?

some guy named manny.

an innocent person dead
because you screwed up!

manny bergman?

he wasn't innocent.
he's a lawyer.

maybe he's not dead.

maybe i have to
finish him, too.

or what?

he becomes like macelli
or becomes like you?

macelli's
nothing like me.

he's a cold-blooded
killer.

and what are you?

yeah.

[horn honks]

[horns honk]

hey!

jesus christ!

heh heh heh heh!

what the hell you doing?
we're on his ass!

it's over for now.

you two want a room?

yes.

no!

you know what
macelli was.

i know what
he's become.

if we stick together,
we can find him.

i could find him
right now.

just help me get out
of these cuffs.

try that little
key there.

macelli's
got to get inside.

we should do the same.

you look beat.

you look a little
drained yourself.

i'm fine.

you lost a lot of blood.

are you sure
you don't need more?

don't worry.
you're not my type.

aah!
what is this shit?

what the fuck?

gee, mr. macelli.

i never seen you here
so early.

is there something wrong?

mr. macelli, you want
i should, uh, call somebody?

this is good.

leave me alone.
shut the door.

but you're
in the freezer--

get out!
hit the fucking lights!

yeah, ok.

yeah, in my cold storage!

he's got a rump roast
for a pillow!

thank you.

we have a deal?

we'll be staying
till sundown--7:17 p.m.

she insists
it was macelli

and that joe gennaro
was loaded

into the back
of macelli's limo.

then find them--
macelli and gennaro--

and you better hope
gennaro's still alive.

oh, fellas. try not to
lose your car this time.

yes, ma'am.

yes, ma'am.

dr. kivowitz says
you'll be fine, manny.

you just need
a transfusion.

mr. bergman, we know
macelli did this.

he also tried
to assault your wife.

can i count on you
to press charges?

bergman?

bergman?

you're ok.
you're going to be fine.

you've been in there
a long time.

you having trouble with
that deep-down clean?

i thought you'd be
asleep by now.

dream on.

i'm trusting you to see
i don't get any sun.

can i trust you?

it's kind of
a one-way street,

this trust thing.

you can trust me.

right.

my eyes are sensitive.

i know you're good, joe.

a good man.

i see that.

i feel that.

yeah, well, see this,
and feel this--

get the fuck
away from me.

i won't hurt you.

just get over there
on the bed.

chicken shit.

sleep tight.

hiya, bill.

g'day, haynes.

at southampton tomorrow.

a lucky spot

for a few hours.

[alarm stops]

aah!

aah!

aah!
aah!

my god!

aah!

[bed creaks]

we have to go.

i can't.

now's the time
to get macelli.

he's sleeping.

he will sleep
if he's not disturbed,

but his senses
are razor-sharp.

he can wake like that
and move like this.

aah!

you need me, joe.

you really do.

i can't do this.

what happens when
you get excited?

pretty much
as usual, joe.

yeah, but
maybe you bite.

right now, i need this
more than blood.

[unzips zipper]

face it...

you trust me.

at least, partially.

still a little
worried here.

how can we
stop this worry?

think i can have
your name now?

marie.

marie.

where is everybody?

close the door!

lenny, what's
the fucking emergency?

what happened to you?

someone shot me
in the foot.

why?

what's going on,
lenny?

he had me call you,

said it was
something important.

frank, ray,
listen to the guy.

look at the guy!

tell me if it's not time
to pass the torch.

macelli in there?

i'm just saying,

look at the man.

hiya, boys!

and get me
some clean clothes.

and when we find him,
we kill him.
