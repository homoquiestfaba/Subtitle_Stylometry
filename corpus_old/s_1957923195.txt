Diane: Hey, Marla.

My cleaning service
flaked, so I can't make it.

Yeah, it's been a
big ol' shit show.

I had people checking in to
units that weren't cleaned,

and now I'm here with a vacuum.

No, no, you stay. I'm fine.

You know, I got my music.
It's... It's kinda relaxing.

Okay, now, bye-bye.

[ Vacuum whirring ]

[ Knock on door ]

[ Knock on door ]

[ Vacuum shuts off ]

[ Door opens ]

Hi. Can I help you?

Mother: Yes, I'm having a
little bit of car trouble.

These steep mountain
roads, they got me stuck.

Can I borrow your phone?

My phone? Don't you
have a cellphone?

It... It died.

Guess it just ain't my day.

Oh, this here's my son.

[ Footsteps ]

[ Man laughing ] [ Thudding ]

Wait, what are you...
No, you can't...

No, what are you...
You can't come in here!

[ Thudding, man screams ]

[ Diane screaming ]

[ Man laughing ]

[ Door closes ]

[ Screaming continues,
vacuum whirring ]

[ Laughing ]

I lost my pretty
face. She'll see me!

Don't worry, baby. I
got your pretty face.

Remember, say nice
things to her.

Girls like to hear nice things.

[ Man grunting,
Diane screaming ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ Squishing ] [ Man roars ]

Did that feel good? [ Grunts ]

Did you get your yuckies out?

[ Laughs ]

I guess she wasn't the one.

You'll know when the
right one comes along.

Right one.

Oh, baby, you
certainly made a mess,

I'll tell you that.

All these cleaning supplies
sure do come in handy.

Lucky for us.

What you doing there, baby?

Evidence.

Evidence!

Such a big word!

You're such a smart man.

You're destroying evidence.

Evidence. Yes.

But we can't burn the body.

No, bones don't burn.

We're going to have to
bury the body somewhere

and then just bury the
evidence with that.

Like the digging game.

[ Groaning happily ] You
like the digging game?

Huh?

[ Sighing ] Alright.

[ Vehicle approaches ]

Oh, crappus dappus,
baby. We need to hide.

Grab the body. Help me.

Oh, oh, come on.

Good.

[ Grunting ]

[ Footsteps, muffled
conversation ]

Alex: [ Muffled ]
What'd I tell ya?

Isn't this great? [ Beeping ]

Zoe: Yeah. It's great, right?

Really nice. [ Door opens ]

My lungs are not used
to all this clean air.

At least we got our steps in.

Do you think the cleaner came?

Uh, she was supposed to be gone
at 4:00, and it is after 4:00.

There's still dust everywhere.

Well, babe, it's...
It's rustic, you know?

I mean, supposedly
parts of this house

were built before the Civil War.

So, uh, I think we're probably

just gonna have to
get used to the dust.

Did you leave the
fireplace going?

Or was that the cleaning lady?

Uh, no, that was... that was me.

I was filming and
I think I forgot.

Alex, that's super dangerous.

You could've burned
the house down.

I mean, I didn't, so
that's... That's good news.

Hey, you want some wine?

God, yes. But I
gotta pee first.

Cool.

[ Door closes ]

[ Toilet flushes ]

Hey, you want to, uh, go
chill out by the fire,

and I'll... I'll serve you.

Okay.

Won't I mess up your shot?

Alex: No, no, no,
no, you're good.

I'm actually pretty
good with that.

I just, um... I usually just
shoot for like an hour or two

and then I find, like, a
little bit that I like,

and I loop it... corkscrew.

[ Soft clatter ]

Ah, found it.

The cleaning lady
did the hearth.

It's still wet.

Oh, I was screwing
with that corkscrew.

I didn't even need to.

Wine's a screw
top. [ Chuckles ]

Mm. Mm!

Oh, fancy!

[ Purrs, laughs ]

Did you know that screw tops

are actually a lot
better for the wine?

Hmm.

But wine makers keep using corks

because they think
all of us just assume

if something has a cork
that it's, like, nicer.

Mm. Big Cork
suppressing the truth.

I got your big cork
right here, baby.

Hope it's bigger than a cork.

It's marginally
bigger than a cork.

I know. Just a little bit.

[ Laughs ]

To, um...

To us. The coral
reefs not dying.

To us and the coral
reefs not dying, yeah.

I read something the other
day, they've got that, um,

sunscreen that, like,
doesn't hurt the reefs?

Pretty cool. Yeah. But
they're still dying.

There's a lot of things
that are killing it.

Yeah, like I said, it's,
you know, always something.

Would you like to join
me on this luxurious rug?

Okay, I know where
this is going.

What? Is your camera still on?

No. No. I just wanted to...

Mm-hmm. Chill out on the rug.

Yeah? 'Cause that one
time was a one-time deal.

Oh, that one time was... I'm not going
to end up in your sexy yule log video.

Hey! Hey! Hey! No, no,
no, you say that now

until that cash starts rollin'
when we start that OnlyFans.

Babe, I don't think that I
want to sit on a dead bear.

I mean, do you think it's real?

Do I think this is
a fake bearskin rug?

Is that even really
a thing, babe?

It's just... I
dunno. It's cruel.

Oh, it's cruel, it's cruel.

Says the girl wearing
leather boots.

Okay, first of all, there's
no face on my boots.

And it's just...

I dunno. It just
feels weird, okay?

Okay! And, yeah, he's
just sitting there

staring at us pissed. Sure.

I mean, I can... I can move him.

Why are you petting
his head like that?

Because he's a friend now.

You actually look
really cute on it.

Yeah? Yeah.

In a... sexy
caveman kind of way.

Oh?

Don't let the boy see.

[ Laughs ] Yeah.

You look really good,
too, actually. Oh.

You got this, like, sexy
glow from the fireplace.

You look like, um...

BeyoncÃ©? BeyoncÃ©.

[ Exhales deeply ] Thank you.

I love you. I love you.

Yeah? Yeah.

Mm.

Would the lady like a snack?

Mmm, always.

Yeah? Yeah.

Okay.

Okay.

Ah, ah, shit, shit shit!

Mm! Damn it! Hey,
are you okay?

Yeah, no, I just got a...

What's wrong? What's up? I got
a charley horse or somethin'.

It's not a big deal.
Oh, no, no, no.

I might have some Tylenol. No,
I just got to stretch it out.

It's cool, it's cool,
it's cool. Listen.

Listen, Zoe, Zoe.

This last year with
you has been, like,

the most rad year of
my life. Good, babe.

Yeah, and... I've had a
really good time, too.

Where is my Tylenol? Um,
there's only really one thing

that I think could
make it better.

Babe, where'd you put the
Tylenol? And that's if...

you married me.

[ Laughing ] Oh, my God!

You said something was wrong
with your leg, you asshole!

Well, I said what I had to say!

Oh, my God, Alex!

It's so...

It's so beautiful.

Where'd you get it?

It was Nana's.

Kinda cheesy, I guess, but, uh,

I know you told me you
didn't want me to, you know,

do the whole blood
diamond thing, so...

And I love you for that.

God, I...

I'm just... I'm...
I'm in shock, babe.

You're in shock? Are
you serious? Yes!

I took you to this
beautiful mountain retreat,

and you're... And
you're surprised?

I-I've just been
working so much,

I didn't even, weirdly,
think about it, I guess.

Okay.

Oh, my God.

Well, I mean...

what do you say?

Alex.

Babe, you know I love you.

Hmm?

Hmm?

[ Chuckles ] Yeah. Yeah.

I mean, you're... you're
kinda scaring me right now.

[ Vehicle approaches,
siren chirps ]

Um...

Okay.

That's weird. Uh...

Babe, something is wrong.

You don't know that.

[ Door opens ]

Hi.

Sheriff: Sorry
to bother y'all.

Uh, we're just
canvassing the area

to see if you noticed
anything unusual last night?

Oh, uh, we weren't
here last night.

We got here today.
We're renting.

Yeah, we checked in
early and went for a hike

so they could finish
cleaning the place.

Deputy: Did you hear
or see anything unusual

while you're staying
here, anything suspicious?

No. We didn't hear or
see anything suspicious,

did we, Alex?

Alex: No.

Is something wrong?

Well, um, we don't wanna
freak out the tourists.

Tourists are our lifeblood.

But we found a body on the other
side of the mountain last night.

Oh, my God.

Is it a hiker or something?

How... How did they die?

The coroner's doing a report.

That's all we can say right now.

Deputy: But she didn't
beat and strangle herself.

Alex: Holy shit!

Oh, my God. Babe.

Wait a minute.

May I come in?

Uh... yeah, that's fine.

Yeah, come on in.

[ Sighs ]

[ Door closes ]

Where'd you get the log?

Uh, just down the
road a little bit.

From the tree with the
rocks around it in a circle?

Yeah. I think so. Why?

Is there something wrong?

That's a hanging tree.

They used to hang slaves on it.

Ohh. Oh, my God!

I-I-I didn't know.

I-I mean, how was
I supposed to know?

It just was a-a
cool-looking log.

And the branch I cut
it off was dead, so...

Didn't you see the plaque?

No, I didn't see the plaque.
Did you see a plaque?

We... We saw no
plaques, Sheriff.

Oh, Diane took down
that plaque, Sheriff.

Yeah, she rents that place
out for weddings down there.

They don't want to
read about slavery.

She took down the plaque?

Yes. 'Cause of weddings.

Well, it's her land, but she
shouldn't have done that.

I'm going to have to
talk to her about that.

Did we do something wrong?
'Cause we had no idea.

That's also a very sacred tree

to the tribe that used to
live around these parts.

Yeah, they considered
it a demon tree.

They would never touch it.

Supposedly it fed on fear

and all the iron from all the
blood spilling underneath it.

Hollis.

I'm researching
for a Ghost Walk.

Well, these nice people don't
need your ghost walk spiel.

They're on vacation.

Can I get a glass of water?

Yeah, of course. Of course.

[ Light thud ]

[ Water running ]

Now, I'm not the
superstitious type.

Yeah.

But I've heard enough of
this weird crap around here.

Some of these people
think this mountain's

like some kinda hillbilly
Bermuda Triangle.

Yeah. Maybe it's
from the tree.

Maybe it's not.

It is.

Well, we won't do it again.

[ Sizzling ]

Oh. [ Chuckles ]

Okay. Um...

I wouldn't burn that log again.

Tomorrow I'd bury
it respectfully.

Don't touch it.

Use some cloth to carry it out.

Maybe even say a prayer.

That's what I'd recommend.
Yeah, okay, no, absolutely.

We'll do whatever's necessary.
We're so sorry. Yeah. Yeah.

We'll... We'll say our prayers
and everything, yeah. Yeah.

Y'all two on vacation?

Uh, we were, yes, a
very nice vacation

until both of you guys showed up

talking about dead
bodies and demon trees.

Well, wait until he tells
you about the aliens.

[ Laughs ]

I-I'm sorry.

Y-You two seem like
a very nice couple.

And I-I want you to
enjoy yourselves.

But I just like to be cautious.

The Sheriff's very cautious.

Sure.

That's a nice camera.

Uh, yeah, thank you.

Yeah. What do you
call this thing?

Like a...

DSLR?

Uh [Chuckles] close.

It's an AF100.

It's probably overkill
for my purposes,

but, uh, you know, I just
like stuff to look nice.

You know, like,
during the holidays

where people that
don't have a fireplace,

they like to put up
a video of a fire?

Yeah.

I make those. I put
them on YouTube.

Oh, no kidding?

Hey, we use that
down at the station.

Yeah. It's got
Christmas music on.

Yeah, my daughter uses
one, too, to study.

She's got ADHD.

Well, uh, I did one
last year in Bali.

It was a, uh... Like a
beach bonfire situation.

Pretty cool.

Huh. Is that like a
job or just a hobby?

Um, I make some
money at it, yeah.

He has at least a million views.

I'm in the wrong
business. [ Chuckles ]

Well, If you recorded that log,
I would definitely erase it.

Anyway, we'll let
you nice people

get back to your vacation.

But if you need anything,
anything at all,

here's my card.

Absolutely.

Yep, we will be in touch.

Have a good night, Sheriff.

Deputy. Ohh, watch your step.

Appreciate all you guys do.

Protecting and serving.

Your tax dollars at
work, by the way.

Like, what was that?
[ Guns clicking ]

Zoe: That is so
disturbing. Yeah, I know!

It's like I hate it when these
men in positions of power

just believe all this,
like, superstitious shit.

I'm talking about the killing.

There's a killer
on the loose, Alex!

Right, yes, I know
about, yeah, that.

But, you know, honestly,

I wouldn't really
worry about that, babe.

I mean, most murders
are family disputes,

statistically speaking.

Right?

And if it is a serial killer,

which, despite all the
true-crime documentaries

would have you believe,
is super, super rare,

he's probably very
far away from here.

Babe, it can't be that rare.

There's many true-crime
shows about them.

You really need to stop watching
that shit before you go to bed

with as anxious as you are.

Ugh, God. I have to
be prepared, Alex.

Always be prepared, right,

my little... My
little Boy Scout.

Come here.

What do you say I
relight that log?

Or... Or...

Or pick a different one?

The sheriff said don't.
The sheriff said don't?

The sheriff said don't, Alex. Okay, alright,
listen, I'm going to ask you something.

I'm going to ask you
something. Be honest with me.

Do you believe that
that log is cursed?

Hmm?

I don't know what
to believe. Okay?

I-I-I think the sheriff
might be watching.

He might see the smoke. Okay,
alright. Well, fuck me, then right?

'Cause I just wanted to
light a fire in a cabin

with my girlfriend and propose
to her on a bearskin rug.

Yeah.

You never answered
me, by the way.

Answered what?

"Will you marry me?"

Can we... Can we just
talk about that later?

What does that mean?
What does that mean, Zo?

I'm just... I mean,
like, do you want to?

Do you not want to? Do you
want to think about it?

Babe, I'm just
freaked out right now!

You're freaked out by who?

By... By Sheriff Bumfuck
and Deputy Cletus?

What? What? Are
you... A-Are you mad?

No. No. No.

No.

I'm not.

Babe. Yeah?

I love you and I
want to marry you.

I do, but I'm just scared.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

I'm... I'm fucking scared right
now. Look, I-I'm scared, too!

It's a huge step. I know that.

I-I-I know.

Alex, no! It's...
It's not that.

Okay? You're... You're always
so just happy-go-lucky.

And... And I have my shit.

What if it gets worse, huh?

What if it gets
worse like my mom?

What if I grind you down the way my mom did my
dad? Okay, you're not... you're not like your mom.

You're not like your mother!
You're nothing like your mother.

You're not! And I'm
not your dad, Zoe.

I'm not.

Look at me.

Look at me.

You're not going
to grind me down.

You might... You
might polish me, huh?

Polish each other.

Like... Like little diamonds.

Don't you... Don't you just feel

like you should be
with someone happier?

No. No. No. Wouldn't that make you
happy, to be with someone happier?

Huh? I want... I want you.

You big stupid,
dumb, dumb idiot.

You always know the
right things to say.

But I... But, but, but.

I feel cursed.

Yes, like our friend the
log in the fireplace.

Don't joke. Don't
joke about that.

Okay.

It's... It's like
a... It's like, um...

It's like a sense of doom.

Like I'm always waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

You know, like...
Like, what if...

What if we're at a certain place

at a certain location
at a certain time

and then a tree
happens to fall on us

and had you not
been married to me,

none of this would
have happened.

You would have never died, Alex.

Zoe, that is so
completely off the rails.

I-I-I'm going to ask
you something right now

and I really, really don't
want you to get angry at me.

Can you promise to try?
I-I'm going to try.

But you prefaced it really
strongly. Do you think...

that maybe...

we should up your medication?

[ Sighs ]

[ Sighs ]

It's not about my meds,
Alex! Okay. Alright.

It's not about my meds. Okay.

This... This is who I am.

Alright. Look, I'm sorry.

A lot of fucked-up shit
has happened to you

in your life, babe.

And I-I-I just want
you to be happy.

Okay? That's all I want.

That's all I want.

This isn't just Willow.

Okay.

The planet is dying, Alex.

And I'm supposed to what?
Go pick out china patterns?

"Oh, my God! That's so pretty!

Do you have it in lilac?
Do you have it in blue?"

How am I supposed to raise
a child in this hellhole?

Okay. Alright.

How do you... How do you
even plan for the future

when there is none? Alright,
listen, listen! Everything...

How do you plan for the
future when there isn't one?

Every era of time...
Nothing matters!

Every era of time seems shitty
when you're in it, okay?

That's just an
objective point of fact.

Everybody believes that
about their era, right?

Okay, just imagine, like,
living in World War I or II.

Oh! Ooh! Pick an era!

As a black woman during the Civil
War. Oh! As a black woman, huh?

Don't... Don't do that.
Don't do that! Okay.

I'm making a very cogent
point right now, okay.

Ohh. Cogent.

I just think that we are living

at a pretty good little
pocket of time in history.

You know, uh,
comparatively speaking.

I guess my point is that
there's always going to be

shitty aspects of life, babe.

No matter what era you live in.

And you just gotta... You
just gotta find the good.

You know, you got to
lean into the good.

Babe, this time is different.

The world is literally going
to hell in a handbasket.

I think you mean figuratively.

Okay, yeah. Yeah,
maybe you're right.

But you know what?

If it going to hell
in a handbasket,

I want to be in that
handbasket with you.

Me and you. In a handbasket.

Just... Just two guys,

plummeting to the depths of hell
in a... in a handbasket, right?

Assuming we can
find one, I guess,

big enough for... for two of us.

Although if the world
is in a handbasket,

I guess we would also be...

Do you want to go
in the hot tub?

[ Laughs ]

You were just terrified of a
killer stalking in the woods,

and now you want
to go in a hot tub?

I never said I was consistent.

[ Vehicle approaches,
vehicle doors open, close ]

Do you hear that?

[ Footsteps approach ]

[ Beeping ] Oh, my
God, it's the killer.

They have the code, babe.

Uh, just... just relax.

Whoa. Hello?

Hi.
Hey.

What can I do for you?

Ben: We're renting the
place? Who are you guys?

Huh. Um...

I'm sorry, actually,
we're renting the place.

The reservation's on
my phone. Hold on.

Okay, well, I've got
the reservation on mine.

Did you guys go through Airbnb?

No. Mountain Getaways.

Beth: Could I actually
come in and pee?

I've just been holding it for...

Yes! You can! 'Cause
we rented the place.

Okay. Excuse me.
No, no.

Yeah. Everyone in! Yeah.
No! No, no, no, no. No, No.

Can you guys just go... just go back
outside, please? We rented the place.

Yeah, we did. See. Here.
No, I'm so sorry.

Oh, crackers. Fuck it.
Can I see yours?

Yeah, yeah.
Okay.

Hey, uh, babe.

Do you think that we
should have people inside

while there's a
killer on the loose?

Holly: Killer? Tell me more!

Looks like we're
double booked. Yeah.

We each booked on
different websites

and it didn't
reconcile or something.

Okay, um...

Okay, I'll just call the owner.

Oh, yeah, I'll call
the owner, too.

It's a race. [ Chuckles ]

We all took these
edibles designed to hit

as soon as we got here,

so I don't see us
driving anywhere tonight.

Seriously? Babe,
it's gonna be fine.

I'm sure they've got,
like, tons of properties.

[ Cellphone buzzing ]

Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Like...

[ Crunches ] Shh!

You guy's hear that?

It's a phone ringing.

It's not mine.

[ Buzzing continues ]

I hear it.

Where is it?

It's a cellphone
underneath the couch.

Babe, this is so fucked. Huh.

This has to be the
landlady's phone.

Okay. Okay, yeah.

Um, she probably just left it on
accident when she was cleaning.

Who leaves their
cellphone behind?

Babe, I'm getting scared.

I think that we should go
ahead and call the sheriff.

You have his card.
Oh, fuck, that guy?

He sucks.

Alright, fine, I'll
just get the card.

Holly: You just happen to
have the sheriff's card?

Yeah, that's suspect.

Okay, it's not as
weird as it sounds.

He was up here earlier.

He's investigating a
murder or something.

Whoa. Wait, that's perfect.

We do a murder podcast.

Our podcast is called "There's
a Podcast in the House"!

[ Imitates air horn blowing ]

Have you heard of our podcast?

Have you heard of our podcast?

I haven't heard of
your podcast! Okay.

Beth: We're still trying
to find our audience.

But you should listen to
some of the newer episodes,

'cause some of the older ones,
like, aren't so good, but...

Babe. Babe.

Hey, this is a nice camera.

What are you guys filming,
a porno or something?

No. Alex shoots yule log
videos as a side hustle.

If I left my phone behind,

I think that I would try and
go and find it immediately.

Why didn't...

Why didn't the landlady go
and try to get her phone?

Yo, yo, do you do that for
money or, like, as a hobby?

Because that's a genius idea.

So easy.

God. That's so not
important right now.

Alex: Well, it started
out as a hobby, actually,

but then I, uh, fell
into monetizing it.

Actually, last year, I, uh,

shot a bonfire on
the beach in Bali.

It's up to like 10 million
views or something.

Okay! That's really
cool. Bali, man.

Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Could you please not
do that right now?

The sheriff said not to do that.

Okay, whoa. Okay.

What, is it, like, illegal
to burn logs or something?

[ Laughter ]

We accidentally got
it from a cursed tree.

So is that why it won't light?

Oh! Checks out.

No, I-I totally feel the
cursed energy coming from it.

You feel the edible
hitting, Henry.

It was used to hang
enslaved people.

Whoa. We just...

The hanging tree. We
just read about it.

Totally!

Is that... Ah, fuck!

Aw, babe!

It's a splinter! Did
you hurt yourself?

Aw, I'm so sorry. Oof.

We actually just did
this episode recently

about aliens in lynching photos.

Yeah. You've seen the
famous photo, right?

It was, like, essentially viral.

No, I-I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

It's a super-famous photo of
a lynching with a huge crowd.

And there's one dude in
the crowd that looks weird.

He has a face mask on.

He's an alien wearing a mask.

And it's got a chunky
wristwatch, and... Okay.

Uh, wristwatches weren't
invented back then!

Alex: Yeah, no,
for sure, for sure.

Like, totally plausible. Yeah.

Like, if I was an
alien that had, like,

super-advanced technology

and could travel like millions
of light-years to get to earth,

I just wouldn't even bother
with a convincing mask.

Hey, Alex, you're supposed to be
on the phone with the sheriff.

I'm on hold, babe.

I will find a picture.

Oh, there it is.

Decide for yourself.

Whoa. Right, it's freaky.

Actually, yeah,
that's, uh... yeah.

Yeah, I take it back.

This is actually a
super-compelling photo.

Babe, it's like this,
uh, really grainy photo

of, uh, like, a blurry guy.

Yeah. Um, maybe he
just looks like a human

that's a little bit deformed.

So, good job, man.
Very, very sensitive.

Honestly, the most
fucked-up part of that photo

is all the people
just standing around

yucking it up
while somebody's...

Hey, Sheriff.
Hi. This is Alex.

Uh, you came by
the cabin earlier.

Did you want to see the photo?

No, I don't want
to see your photo.

Just... Just stop. Okay.

Okay. Well, you guys
know that this mountain

was the site of a string
of alien abductions

and lynchings in
the 1950s, right?

She doesn't care.

Yeah, but, like, Esther Dickens.

The most famous case
is Esther Dickens.

Do you know who
Esther Dickens is?

Esther, man. Esther Dickens!

Like, I'm going to be
interviewing her grandkids.

Yeah, for the podcast.
For the podcast!

Enough. Enough
about your podcast.

Whoa. Okay.

The landlady is missing!

Well, that's a
pretty anti-climactic

phone call I just had.

Babe, what did he say?
Uh, not a whole lot.

He said to, uh,
call back tomorrow

if she doesn't show up
later for her phone.

Tomorrow? Yeah.

Tomorrow? Okay.

What kind of half-ass
shit is that?

There is a killer on
the loose. Babe, I know.

What... What do you
want me to say, man?

This is... This is small-town
mountain village life.

You know? You
know what I mean?

This is what happens
in these cities, right?

All the smart, like,
upwardly mobile people,

they move away because there's,
like, shitty jobs here,

and the ones who stick around,

they're all just
superstitious idiots.

They believe stuff
like, you know,

the... the weeping
oak or whatever.

Just all this
superstitious shit.

That sheriff was a
fucking caricature.

And... And this is it.
You know what I mean?

This is... This is what happens.

[ Gun clicking ] Bang, bang.

Bang, bang, bang.
Oh.

Have fun, honey.

â™ªâ™ª

Rosa, that is some
good cornbread!

I'll tell you what,
some people say

you shouldn't serve cornbread
with corn, but I like it.

You could it with grits, too.
That's how much I like corn.

I know that about you, Isaac.

Mm-hmm.

I'm glad you like my cornbread.

Moist.

[ Chuckles ]

Oh. Isaac, can I
ask you for a favor?

Of course, Rosa. What is it?

You're going to
Luthor farm Saturday.

Yes.

I made a quilt.

For William.

It is getting cold.

And it wasn't ready when
he was sold to Mr. Luthor.

But, um, you know,
he's scared of thunder.

So now he can look at this
and every day is blue skies.

Yeah, he always was scared
of thunder, that boy.

Mm-hmm.

That's a nice blanket, Rosa.

I'd like to touch it but I
don't want to get corn on it.

It looks soft.

So will you take it to him?

And while you're there,
can you see how he's doing?

Hey, uh, Rosa, will
you do me a favor?

Will you come sit next
to me here by the fire?

Pull that chair up,
come sit next to me.

What is it?

Uh...

Rosa, I...

I couldn't sell
William to Mr. Luthor.

Yes, sir.

Now, I know we
agreed on Mr. Luthor.

But when Daddy found out,

he said I needed to auction
him to get the best price.

He heard about it.

Well, Mr. Luthor didn't...

Nah. No, Mr., uh...

Mr. Armfield ended up
making a higher offer.

Mr. Armfield?

Now, Rosa, I-I got assurances

that William would
be treated well.

But Mr. Armfield, he's a...

Rosa, I-I got assurances, now.

I looked him in the eye.
No, you gave me your word.

You gave me your word he'd
go to Mr. Luthor. Rosa...

Mr. Luthor, he's a nice man.
Now, now, if Daddy hadn't...

Thank you.
Yeah.

Thanks for letting us
stay. Oh, no problem.

You don't have to thank them.
We're paying for it, too.

We shouldn't have
to pay anything

'cause the host
fucked up, right?

We're going to figure
it out in the morning.

So is there any room off limits?

Actually, our room
has our luggage in it,

so it's pretty obvious.

And there's a room upstairs.
And then there's this couch.

Well, Beth and I will
take the room upstairs.

Uh, Henry, you cool
with the couch?

Huh? Sure. Wait. What
about the basement?

Doesn't that have a bed?

Uh, no, it's got rat
traps and cobwebs.

Ohh, I thought it had bunks
and, like, a pool table.

No, that was the other place.
This one has the hot tub.

Holly: Speaking of which...

let's hot tub!

Okay!

Whoo!

Aw, yeah.

You guys have fun.

Um, excuse me? You're
not gonna come?

Uh, no. Hot tubs
disgust me. What?

Okay. You don't know
what's been in there.

I'm going to take a shower
and wash off the road stank

and Cheeto dust before
the edible hits.

Henry: You're such a grandma.

[ Mutters mockingly ]

Yeah, uh, don't
smoke in the house.

We don't want to
fuck our deposit.

Yeah. Don't smoke
in our house.

Do you two want to hot tub?

Uh, why not?

[ Chuckles ]

[ Laughs ]

Actually, Alex and I
are going to go unpack.

Okay, great.

See you later. Yeah.

Let's go unpack, Alex.

[ Whoosh, fire crackling ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Beth: God! I can't be
the third wheel in this.

Come on, Henry,
give us a "whoo"!

Henry: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Come on. Whoo!

Don't whoo shame me.

Zoe: I just don't
feel comfortable

with them in the house, babe.

Alex: Well, I mean, I guess
we could... I don't know?

Sleep in the car? If
you wanted to do that?

C-Can we please just pump the
brakes on the doom and gloom?

[ Muffled conversation ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ Shower running ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ Grunting ]

[ Body thuds ]

[ Fire crackling ]

[ Door opens ]

Beth: Oh, my God. [
Laughs ] Yes, you do!

I do... I do not
just date Asian guys.

Yes, you do!
No, I swear!

Oh, my God, Ryan, Kevin, Park.

Come on, you have
total Asian fever.

No, I just like
smart, ambitious guys.

It's not a race thing.

Yeah, but I'm not
smart or ambitious.

Yes, you are.

So we have a Trivial Pursuit

that looks like
it's from the '90s

and... a deck of cards.

Oh, no, I've been burned
by rental cards before.

They're always missing
that card that I need.

Mm.
Okay, you better count them.

You count them.

[ Cards thud ]

[ Laughing ] I'm way
too stoned for this.

I'll count them.

Yo!

How much do you make?

What?

You're not supposed
to ask that, Henry!

How much do you make
doing the videos?

Give me a range.

Um...

Well, it's not like top 10
YouTube influencer money,

but, uh, you know, I-I get by.

I also work for an ad agency.

Oh. Ooh, that must
make a lot of money.

You know, at the ad agency,

I sort if feel like
I'm doing pure evil.

But then Zoe helps the coral
reefs, so it sorta balances out.

Well, in addition
to the podcast,

I also do freelance photography.

[ Snickers ] No, you don't.

I shot Christy's wedding.

Yeah, but she didn't pay you.

And the podcast doesn't
pay yet, either.

He's mostly a drug dealer.

I also went to optometry school.

But you didn't finish.

Yet.

So this whole, like, alien
podcast thing you guys do...

Y'all believe that
shit? Like, for real?

Or do y'all just, like,
interested in it ironically?

70/30?

The Esther Dickens
thing is real.

She was visited
by aliens in 1956.

Here, on this mountain.

They probed all up in her
holes and just set her free.

A-And When she
went to the doctor,

she was like 10 pounds lighter.

And the X-rays showed
she was missing organs.

[ Imitates explosion ]

So the aliens, they... they...
They come all the way here

to snatch a kidney?

I mean, come on, man.

You're like Neil deGrasse Tyson.

Why? 'Cause I'm annoying?

No! 'Cause you're smart.

Hmm.

Who lit the fire?

Um, not us.

Oh, yeah. The fire's back.

Hey, do you guys want an edible?

Absolutely.
No.

They're from Colorado. They
got official packaging.

They're not poisonous.

We're not the killer.

Although that is what
the killer would say.

I'm going to bed.

Alex: Okay, I'll
be in in a bit.

Is she okay?

Yeah, she'll be fine.

We're just going
through some... stuff.

These edibles are very chill.

They might chill her out.

No, I appreciate the
sentiment, but probably not.

She's had a lot of, like,
really fucked-up shit

that's happened to her recently.

Like what?

You're not supposed
to say that, Henry.

It's... It's... It's fine.

Um...

You guys really can't
say anything, okay?

Okay.

So she works for this nonprofit

that helps the
coral reefs, right?

That's cool. Yeah, very cool.

Wait, I thought the
coral reefs were saved.

I have, like, the suntan lotion.

It, like, says it's
safe for the reefs.

[ Growling ]

Hey! Heeeyyyy! Hey!

Come here!

One night, they're having
this, like, uh, auction, right.

Lots of rich people.
Lots of cash flowing.

You know how rich people get.

They just want to
save something.

Anyways, part of Zoe's job is
to, like, handle the money,

take it to a bank after
hours, drop it off.

So that day she had,
like, her period,

and it was, like, apparently
like a heavy-flow kind of day

and it started bleeding
through her dress a little bit,

so she asked one
of her co-workers,

a girl named Willow, if
she could take the cash.

So Willow does, and then,
like, on the way to the bank,

she gets robbed and murdered.

Oh, shit!

What? Yeah. Yeah.

But... Okay, but that's
not her fault, though.

Oh, I-I know. I know.
I-I think she knows.

Like, intellectually.

You know, but, like, good
luck explaining that to her.

You know, I mean, she still
feels like it was her fault.

Like it was supposed
to be her, right?

She, like, bought a gun and she,
like, keeps it in her purse.

I mean, it's like
in there right now.

I really shouldn't
be telling you this.

Man, I really, really shouldn't.

We won't say shit.

Alright, so, like,
not too long ago,

she, like, took too
many sleeping pills

before she went to bed.

Oh, shit. Yeah, I know.

And she told me that
it was an accident,

and I, like, believed her.

I believed her.
That's my girlfriend.

I love her. Yeah.

But she, like,
went to treatment,

and that was like
about a year ago.

She's doing better. She
says she's doing better.

But I don't... I don't know.

Little man: Come here!

[ Muffled talking ]

Come here, you little scamp.

Come on over here.

I got something to show ya.

Oh, get on over here.

Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

Nicely done, son!

A lot of people have
trouble with that.

They burn themselves or whatnot.

But you got right in here.

This is like that meme.

What?

That meme with the dog.

Where he says, "This is fine."

[ Laughs ]

"This is fine."

You know that?

Y-Yes.

But don't you worry.

This is fine.

You want a soda?

I'll take a Dr Pepper.

[ Sighs ]

[ Bottles clink ]

â™ªâ™ª

Don't you worry
about them, my man.

They have their path,
and you have yours.

Hmm.

No Dr Pepper,

but I got a Nurse Nutmeg.

You ever had a Nurse Nutmeg?

No. Ah!

Even better than a Dr Pepper.

Goes down easier.

Sorta like it's easier
to get an appointment

with a nurse than a doctor.

[ Laughs ]

Just pretend to drink
it. It might be poison.

It's not poison.

But I get it.

Just thought you were thirsty.

Drink it or don't drink it.

Anyway, that is not what
I wanted to show you.

â™ªâ™ª

[ Bell dings ]

â™ªâ™ª

[ Laughing ]

[ Clicking ]

[ Upbeat music plays ]

[ Laughs ]

[ Rock music plays ]

Goes into the future, too.

[ Whirring ]

Pretty neat, huh?

Yeah.

Really?

You think so?

Oh, it's so hard to
surprise people these days.

What with the Internet,
all the content.

Special effects.

Everybody's seen everything.

So I hear you're the
screw-up of the family.

Nah.

Hmm... That's
what I just heard.

Sisters are two doctors.
One's a surgeon?

Yeah. But, um, my parents
just want me to be happy.

So they're happy
you're a drug dealer?

Well, they don't know that.

I'm also a podcaster.

Podcaster!

Good for you.

What if I told you I could wipe
all the failures from your life?

Wipe it clean?

Sounds like a trap.

[ Laughs ]

Ah, you kids don't miss a thing.

Real street smart, you kids.

Your generation are no suckers.

I'll tell you that.

Do you recognize
that woman there?

Mom? That's right.

Any guesses who
she's pregnant with?

Probably me. Or
one of my sisters.

You is the correct answer.

She is pregnant with you.

8 months.

And I have a way of making
your life less disappointing.

This is a magic marker.

Or, in this case, a
magic magic marker.

You go through that fireplace.

And you see that piece of
paper on the coffee table?

Yeah. You write A++

on that piece of paper and
you put it on the fridge.

Real quiet now. Don't
wake your mom up.

You write A++,

and that baby in her
belly will be a success.

Wh-What if she wakes up?

That'll terrify her.

You gotta be quiet.

I can't make it
all easy for you.

Success requires some risk, son.

You know, I'm starting to think
that is part of your problem.

No, I'll... I'll... I'll do it.

A++.

Okay.

[ Indistinct talking on TV ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ Moans softly ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Nicely done, son.

Your days of failure
are behind you now.

I did exactly what you said.

A++.

Right on her stomach.

What did you say?

On the refrigerator, I mean.

I don't think you
followed my instructions.

Uh, I-I don't know.

I...

I think I did. A++.

On her stomach. No,
on the refrigerator.

Were you high when you did it?

It was a magic marker.

That, son, is a kitchen knife.

It was a magic marker.

I'd love to argue with you

but I don't debate with
people that don't exist.

[ Doors open, bell dings ]

[ Laughter ]

Oh. Well, uh, I think
Zoe's pretty lucky

to have a boyfriend like you.

Thank you.

And I'm pretty lucky
to have you, too!

Aw. I'm lucky to
have you, babe.

Ben's lucky to have you.

Where is Ben? Is
he still showering?

Maybe he's masturbating.

Actually, I-I'm gonna go see

if he got sucked down
the drain or something.

Ben is gross.

A little bit.

[ Shower running ]

[ Screaming ]

What's going on?
Oh, my God, no!

Beth? Hey, what's going on?

Fuck!

Shit. D-Don't touch
anything. No, fuck!

It's evidence.

Should we move him?

Should we give him
mouth to mouth?

He doesn't even have
a fucking mouth!

Okay, okay, okay. Where's
the sheriff's card?

I'm going to call the sheriff.

No, fuck that.
I'm calling 911.

It's the curse. You
shouldn't have lit the fire!

Nobody lit a fucking fire!

Where were you when we
were in the hot tub?

What, you think I did
that shit? Somebody did.

Just go away. Go
over there. Fuck you.

Woman: 911. What's your
emergency? You need to come now.

My boyfriend, he's
dead in the shower,

and his skull is bashed in.

You say bashed in. Is
he still breathing?

Of course he's not breathing.
His skull is bashed in...

[ Screaming ]

Alex: What the fuck!

Alex, it's the log!
It's the fucking log!

No, no, no, no, no, somebody...

Somebody threw it and
they're still here.

It wasn't thrown. I
saw it. It just flew.

No, no, no, no, no, baby.
No, that's impossible, okay.

That is impossible.

It wasn't thrown, Alex!

Either way, this log's going
to burn the house down.

â™ªâ™ª

[ All screaming ]

[ Splat ]

Ah, fuck!

No!

â™ªâ™ª

911. What's your emergency?

Hey, we need your help.
People are murdered!

Don't say it's a flying
log. They won't come.

Do you have an address?
I-I-I don't know.

It's an Airbnb. It's...
It's Booth Mountain.

Booth Mountain, uh...

Please. There's...
There's a log.

It's pounding on the
door! Alright. Stay calm.

Can you pull up the
address on an app?

Do you have an e-mail
with the address?

Can't you track it?

Baby, hey, I forwarded you that
e-mail confirmation yesterday.

Just... Just check your e-mail. I
can't pull up the address for you

'cause I'm on the
phone right now!

Please, there is
a log at the door!

Okay, you say someone is
pounding a log on your door?

No, no one is pounding the log!

The log is fucking
flying by itself!

[ Breathing heavily ] Oh, God.

It stopped.

Maybe it's gone.

Wait, wait. Okay.

The sheriff came
by the house today.

And he warned us about the
log. We got in trouble for it.

Yeah, the sheriff will
know where we are!

You mean a police officer?

No, no, no, no, the
sheriff and his deputy.

We don't have a sheriff.

We have a chief of police.
Her name is Chief Mackies.

God damn it! It's a sheriff.

[ Distorted crying ]

Hello?

Hello?

Zoe!

Log: Arson!

Arson!

Arson!

Go, go, go!

Go, go, go.

[ Holly crying ]

No, no.

What?
Trust me. Come on.

Come on. Come on. Come, come.

Okay.

Why did you bring us in
here? We are trapped!

No, no, no, no, no, hey,
hey, this is the best place.

There's no windows, look!

[ Breathing heavily
] What about Holly?

It's going to get Holly.

Holly... Holly will be fine.

She ran outside. She's
probably at the car.

[ Holly screaming ]

It's okay. No,
no, no, it's okay.

We're going to be fine.
We're going to be fine.

No, we're not. Shhh!

Keep your voice
down, okay, please.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Do you still have your phone?

No, it died when I was
on the phone with 911.

Okay, that's good. Okay,
that's good, that's good.

No! They're not coming, Alex.

Of course they're coming.
You hung up on them.

They don't know where we are.

Did you not hear the log?

It was crying! It's from hell.

It's not from hell, okay!

Some psychopath in the
woods is fucking with us.

That's all. That's all!

The... The... The crying is
prerecorded or something.

A-And... And there's
a drone in the wood.

That's how it can
fly around. What?

No drone can do that,
okay? It's a cursed log.

This is not some
Scooby-Doo shit, okay?

We're gonna be safe in
here for the night, okay.

We're gonna hide and be safe.

That thing's not gonna
be active during the day.

You don't know that.

We had that fire going all
day long and nothing happened.

Hmm? Nothing happened
till the sun went down.

But did you hear
what it was yelling?

It was yelling,
"Arson, arson."

It's going to burn us alive.

Alex. Okay, okay.

Okay, listen, first sign of
smoke comes under that door,

we'll make a break for it, okay?

Th-There... Th-There's an axe...

There's an axe on
the front porch.

We get the axe,
we get to my car,

we get off this mountain.

The sheriff was a fake sheriff.

When he came in, he sprinkled
something on the log.

I-I didn't think anything of it.

What are you talking
about? What are you...

I didn't think anything of it.

He must be, like, in
on it or something.

I'm sure he cast,
like, an evil spell.

Zoe, come on.

You still don't
believe it's a curse.

With all due respect,
babe, no, I don't.

If... If brutality against
Blacks and Native Americans

in this country caused curses,

then murderous logs would be
as common as fuckin' Starbucks.

And they aren't.
They just aren't.

A tiny drone cannot lift a guy.

Fine. You know what?
I hope it is a curse.

I do. We'll write a book.

A best seller. We'll
be fuckin' rich.

Oh, my God, Alex.

If we survive.

We are going to survive.

This is a heavy door, babe.

No windows. It can't get in.

We're in the best
place to be right now.

Oh, my God, my
camera. [ Laughs ]

My camera's still
downstairs. It's rolling!

We're gonna have evidence of
this, everything that happened!

We'll sell it.

They'll make a
movie out of this.

Who do you want to play you?
We're going to die, Alex.

We are not going to die.
We are not going to die.

Look at me. Look at me.

I love you.

Do you love me?

I'm gonna need a vocal
confirmation on that, babe.

Yeah? Yeah? Yes.

Okay, good. I love you, too.

Do you trust me? Yes.

I trust you, too.

You're the fiercest
woman I know.

â™ªâ™ª

I kinda think Chris
Pratt should play me.

We need butts in seats, babe.
We're gonna need a name.

Alright? This is gonna
be a blockbuster.

So you think this is gonna
be a theatrical movie?

Not some, like... Like,
straight to Netflix...

Babe, of course this
is theatrical release.

Look... Look around you!

This is not straight-to-DVD shit

that's happening to us
in this house right now!

It's bad. Yeah,
it's really bad.

It's awful. It's like
the first proven example

of real supernatural shit.

This is gonna be,
like, Marvel movie big.

Now, who do you
want to play you?

â™ªâ™ª

[ Clatter ]

Arson! [ Zoe screaming ]

Alex: Go, go, go!

â™ªâ™ª

Come on! Come on! Come
on! Come on! Come on!

â™ªâ™ª

[ Screams ]

â™ªâ™ª

[ Fire crackling, Zoe crying ]

â™ªâ™ª

[ Breathing heavily ]

No. [ Whimpers ] [
Mumbling indistinctly ]

â™ªâ™ª

[ Muffled shouting ]

Remember, now, say nice things
to 'em. [ Women screaming ]

Girls, they like
to be complimented.

Alex: [ Muffled ]
Zoe! Nice things.

[ Screaming continues ]

Zoe!

Zoe!

Zoe!

I would not get in the way
of my son and his date.

You don't wanna do that. Nope.

It's like getting in the
way of a lion and his food.

Listen, um, we are all
in a lot of danger.

This... This house
is, uh... It's cursed.

I swear to God.

Did you see all the
fucking bodies outside?!

We all in danger.

[ Chuckles ]

Every day is danger.

You been out there?

People batshit
crazy. [ Chuckles ]

Eenie, meenie...

eenie, meenie...

eenie...

Pick her. She's... She's
prettier than me! meenie...

P-Pick her.

She's prettier.

Don't pick me. No.
Eenie, meenie...

eenie, meenie...
Don't pick me, no. No.

Eenie, moe. Please, no! No!

No! No! [ Shouting
indistinctly ]

No! No!

Meenie!

No, no, no, no, no, no!

[ Laughing ]

No, no! God, no!

No! No! No!

[ Women screaming ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

What's your name?

You can call me Mother, honey.

Mother? Okay.

It's nice to meet you, Mother.

My name's Alex. Oh.

You're doing that thing
where you befriend me.

So I see you as a human
being instead of a victim

so I won't harm you.

[ Chuckles ]

Oh, well, you such a smart one.

No, no, no. It doesn't
have to be like that, okay?

We can get out of here.
You can let me go.

I can... I can give you money.

I-I-I have an
engagement ring, right?

What... What... What
is it that you want?

What do you want,
Mother? What do you want?

Well, what do I want?

Hoo-wee! [ Laughs ]

What don't I want?

Mind my manners.

Now, do you want here some
of this pimento cheese?

I've been hogging
it all. Come on.

Come on. Now...

[ Groans ]

You too high class
for pimento cheese?

You wish it was foie gras?

Aah!

Oh, you vegan?

Just try pimento... cheese.

[ Laughs ]

It's pretty good pimento cheese

for store-bought pimento cheese.

[ Laughs ]

Anyway, what do I want?

I want a grandbaby.

I want my son to
give me a grandbaby.

But you can't get
a woman pregnant

when you keep murdering
them, you know?!

It don't make no sense.

If he can just click
with one of 'em,

we can keep her in the basement.

We got a nice basement.

Have a basement family, huh?

All safe, all warm.

If he could just
click with one of 'em.

It's enough to make me want
to adopt a Chinese baby.

How'd that look in church?

Maybe my son is gonna
marry your girlfriend, huh?

[ Laughs ]

'Cause right about now,
it don't sound like

she wants to marry you.

[ Cackling ]

Oh, we was listening.

That's how come we learned...

she has a little
gun. [ Groans ]

She got a little gun.

â™ªâ™ª

Well... mm, you know,

there's so many different ways

to meet women these days.

Mm-hmm.

I think he can meet
a really nice girl.

A girl that likes him
for him, you know?

Um, yeah, he can use
an app. I can show him.

I met Zoe on Bumble.

Bumble?

That would be about
right for him.

He's always bumbling.

Now...

sometimes, Alex, your
kids will disappoint you.

Now, his daddy...

Well, his Daddy was an
insulation salesman.

He could sell dumbbells
to a drowning man.

Hmm.

My son can't sell shit
on account of he's dumb.

No, no, no, no, there's
a shortage in the trades.

Mm-hmm. There's a lack
of good tradesman.

You know, heating and
air, plumbing, garbagemen.

You know?

You look at guys like
that, they're all over 50.

Right? They're all over 50!

'Cause kids don't
want to do it anymore.

But it's good work!

It's really, really good work.

It pays 100 grand a
year. He could do that.

He can get a girl and a house.

It's possible!

Would that it were so, Alex.

You paint a pretty
picture. 100 grand.

It's possible, it's possible!

I can show you.

I can show you both
a different way.

You know, you're right.

You're so right. I'm
so glad we talking.

Let me... Let me
cut these ropes.

Let me go tell my
son to stop his mess.

Oh, my God, God
bless you, Mother.

Thank you. Thank
you. Thank you.

You must think
I'm really stupid.

"Oh, I bet she's just
a stupid bitch," huh?

"your son could be a
plumber!" [ Laughing ]

[ Zoe screams ]

Zoe!

Come on, hang on, baby!
We're gonna be fine!

[ Panting ]

[ Whimpering ]

I like your boobies. Mnh-mnh.

[ Whimpering continues ]

â™ªâ™ª

You wanna see my body?

I'm strong!

No! Please! No!

No!

[ Gasping ]

[ Crying ]

No, no. No.

No! No! No! No! No! No!

No!! No! No! No!

No, no.

No. No. No!

[ Gasping ]

Do you want to see my ding dong?

[ Zipper opens ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Mr. Luthor, he's a nice man!

Now, if daddy hadn't
loaned me that money,

I'd have lost this place and
then you all be scattered.

Everybody! You promised.

How could I justify to Daddy

selling your boy for less money?

Wha-what would I say?
"I'm... I'm fond of him"?

I mean, what would
that sound like, Rosa?

Mr. Armfield is a devil.

And he's a
businessman, too, now.

He's cuttin' ears off,
he's cuttin' toes off.

Oh, my baby! My baby!
Just the bad ones, Rosa!

It's just the bad ones!

If he kept doing that
to all his slaves,

he wouldn't have much of
a business now, would he?

You gave me your word and
now all you're giving me

is excuses! Rosa! Shh! Shh!

People will hear you! Mrs.
Booth is in the other room.

Now, take this to the cookhouse.

Alright? I'm... I'm finished.

I wish I could
done Mr. Luthor.

Would that it were so.

But your son is a good boy.

Your son is a good worker.

He's our son!

He's our son!

Our son! Our son!
Our son! Our son!

Our son! Our son!
Our son! Our son!

Log: Our son! Our son!

â™ªâ™ª

Mommy, no! You're hurting me!

No son of mine is gonna...

I have nowhere to go!

â™ªâ™ª

[ Panting ]

You never loved me!

[ Screams ]

[ Glass shatters ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

I'm not a sodomite!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Pardon my old-lady,
pimento-cheese breath.

But then you have
pimento-cheese breath, too.

Don't fuckin' touch me!
Don't fuckin'... Mnh!

[ Moaning with
pleasure ] [ Groaning ]

Hey! Police! Help! Help!

We're in here! [ Laughs ]

We called the police!

Oh, you stupid fucking bitch!

You and Pleatherface are fucked!

Help! Help!

Help! We're in here!
The killers are in here!

Does that look like
a police car to you?

Arvid, we got company!

â™ªâ™ª

[ Softly ] Oh.

You don't belong here.

[ Gunshots ]

Arvid!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Hey, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

I'm not with her.
My name is Alex.

If you have
faster-than-light travel,

then I know that
you're an advanced race

and you can probably
understand me, okay?

If you have
faster-than-light travel,

then you're... Then
you're civilized!

Um, please just...
Just release me.

If you have
faster-than-light travel,

then you have empathy.
You have empathy, right?

I-I don't want to be
here. Please! Please!

You have
faster-than-light tra...

Aaaaah!

You're hurting me!

Willow: Oh, my God.
That's a silver alien.

They're the worst ones.

Fuck!

Alex! [ Cries ]

Alex!

Shut the fuck up.

Play dead.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

No, no, no! No.

No. Fuck! No.

[ Crying ]

No, no. No, fuck!

[ Screams ]

No! Please! No!

No. No.

[ Gasps ]

â™ªâ™ª

Isaac?

Isaac?!

No! Rosa, what in... No!

Mourner: Such a shame.
She was so young.

She would've been so pretty

if she just kept
that weight off.

I promise. It's not
what it looks like!

I'm not a sodomite.
I'm not a sodomite!

I'm not... I'm not
off! [ Screaming ]

Fuck! Oh!

[ Crying ]

â™ªâ™ª

Bang, bang. I got you!

Only in my shoulder.
Bang! Bang!

â™ªâ™ª

What is it?

An old knife.

It's rusted.

Ooh, I bet that's blood.

I bet Indians used
it to scalp a woman.

Indians didn't have
knives, ya dope.

A cowboy might've used
it to kill an Indian.

A whole mess of Indians.

Esther: What did
I tell you boys

about roughhousing
in the family room?

Sorry, Mom!

Go play outside.

[ Whimpering ]

[ Metal clinking ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Please. [ Thud ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

You love me.

[ Laughing ]

You will now touch me under.

Aaaah!

Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ Panting ]

Alex! Oh, my God, baby!

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Come on, baby.
Come on, come on.

Come on. Do you hear me?

Zoe? Yeah. Yeah,
baby, it's me.

We're getting the fuck out
of here, you understand?

Everything's gonna
be okay. Kill me.

No, no, no, no, no,
do not say that.

I know you're still
in there, baby, okay?

Kill me. You're just in shock.

You're just in shock, it's okay.

Just let me sleep. Aah!

Get up! Get up,
get up, come on!

Get the fuck up, Alex!

Come on.

[ Grunts ]

Just stay with me, okay? Yeah?

Let's get to the fucking car.

My camera.

Fuck your camera, babe, come on.

Fuck! Fuck!

I'm sorry I told
him to pick you.

I'm gonna get us
out of here, Willow.

My name is Holly.

Little Man: Hey!

Hey!

Come here, girl. [ Giggles ]

Come on!

I won't bite.

Come on, girl.

Little farther. Mm-hmm.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

You want something to eat?

You must be hungry.

Something to
drink? I got sodas.

A towel to freshen up?

Does the number 100 million

mean anything to you?

100 million.

It means something to all of us.

Any guesses?

I can't move my arms.

That's the number of sperms

in the average ejaculate.

Crazy, huh?

So when you were conceived,
your sperm had to beat out

99 million and change.

99 million.

Some odds, huh?

And when life is too
hard for some people,

like yourself...

makes you wonder if that
other 99 million and change

might have had a
better go of it.

You know?

Come here, I wanna
show you something.

[ Doors creak, ding ]

[ Whirring ]

[ Clanking ]

So... here is your
parents' house.

And this is the night you
get conceived, you see?

In a little bit, your
parents will come home,

stumble up those stairs,
have sex and make you!

Isn't that something?

Just put this baseball
on the third stair.

It's dark and your
dad will stumble.

Be enough to get his
balls a-jostling,

mix up that sperm a little.

Give another sperm
a chance to be born.

You see?

Another sperm means
another person.

And events will change.

That other person will
probably have a different job,

causing your co-worker
Willow to live.

And with another
person, your boyfriend

will have a chance to
find a better partner,

and you won't have to
suffer with anxiety anymore.

Ahh! It's a win-win.
Don't you see?

Now, does that
sound like a plan?

Does that sound like a plan?

No.

No what?

I... want... to...

I want to live...

You want to live?

You have lived!

Been there, done that.
Didn't care for it.

Don't you think it's
time for a do-over?

Hmm?

You... are... from... Hell!

Now, that hurts.

I'm not from Hell.
I'm from here.

Just a different time is all.

You know, you think
you're a good person.

But in the future,
they say you're not!

Don't you think I wish I
was born when you were?

With progressive
views, your cushy job.

In your fancy, light-filled,
big-city office.

With air conditioning.

Just typing on your
little keyboard all day.

Type, type, type.

With your avocado toast.

I've never even had an avocado.

Yeah, you have privilege, hmm?

But nobody ever talks
about time privilege.

What will they say about
you in the future, Zoe, hmm?

Burning your gas,

contributing to global warming.

Eating your bacon!

Poor little piggies.

[ Gasps ] Stepping over
the homeless people.

They'll say, "Why didn't she

let the homeless people
sleep on her couch?"

And then you want a do-over,

which I am trying to give you!

I'd love a do-over.

But I'm stuck here
in this fucking fire.

Oh, Zoe, you found my knife.

I've been looking
for that forever.

Thank you!

Now, do what needs to be done.

Put the Goddamn
baseball on the stair.

Oh!

Come back here!

[ Grunts ]

Thank you, Alex.
Thank you, baby!

Oh, my God. I just
want to sleep, babe.

No, no, no, no, no,
no! Stay with me!

Stay with me, yeah?
Let's get out of here.

Come on, come on. [ Groans ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Alex.

Alex, keys.

The kitchen.

Fuck!

I'm not going back in
that fuckin' house.

I'll run in the
woods if I have to.

â™ªâ™ª

Log: Fat-ass bitch.

[ Indistinct voices ]

Get your hands off of me.

Stop it!

I don't feel right.

Nothing I do makes you...
I hate you!

I hate you!
This isn't working.

Get the fuck out!

I'll give you
something to cry about.

[ Log thudding,
indistinct yelling ]

â™ªâ™ª

Time to Paul Bunyan
your ass, motherfucker!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Holy fuck. We did it!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ Car locks chirping ]

â™ªâ™ª

[ Engine starts ]

[ People chanting indistinctly ]

â™ªâ™ª

Rosa: No! No!

[ Crying ]

[ Screaming ]

[ Chanting continues ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

No, no. No, you...
You don't understand!

It's that fake fucking sheriff!

You can't leave!

You're important here.

This is the dawn
of a new age of...

Fuck you!

I can and I will!

Don't stop.

I'm not.

I'm not stopping until
the tank is empty.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ Sighs deeply ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

I love you.

I love you, too, baby.

No matter what happens next.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

I think we should make
the logo a tad bit bigger.

You want the logo bigger?

I'm kidding. I'm
imitating our client.

I love it.

Hey, it's your
concept and your copy.

I just laid it out.

Send it. To the client?

Yes to the client!

It's early enough, we
might hear back today.

I hope not.

I just love that glorious moment

when you send something off
and before you get the notes.

It's such a freeing feeling.

We're not getting notes.
It's fucking perfect.

Well, just in case, maybe
we should knock off early.

What would the boss
say? I don't know.

Maybe you should ask the boss.

What do you say, boss?

I say we should knock off early.

Alright.

So you wanna grab a
drink at the Highlander?

You sure we have
time? You know William

loves to get to the
Braves game early.

Oh, that's right! Uh, I guess

we'll just have to grab our
celebratory drink there then.

Hmm. Yeah.

It should be feeling cooler.

A.C.'s pretty old, but I think
I beat it into submission.

[ Sighs ] I feel a
difference already.

Thanks, Arvid. No problem.

Traffic is gonna be hell.

I wish we could just
teleport ourselves there.

Would that it were so..

I think I beat it
into submission.

We're taking William to
the... Would that it were so.

I think I beat it
into submission.

We're taking William to the...

Would that it were so.

I think I beat it
into submission.

We're taking William to the...

Would that it were so.

I think I beat it
into submission.

We're taking William to the...

Would that it were so.

We're taking William to the...

I'm sorry, Rosa.

I'm sorry for what I did.

I'm sorry for everything.

I love you, Rosa.

Forgive me, Rosa.

I'm sorry for everything.

I love you, Rosa. I'm
sorry for what I did.

Sorry for all the... [ Screams ]

[ Screams ]
