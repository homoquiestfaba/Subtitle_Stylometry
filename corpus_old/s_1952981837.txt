Red Rover, Red Rover

Well Bobby Tricker

Asco! He scratches his nose,
and eats boogers

What's that? Is weak

Well friends, we can do
Chrissy we can only take

Red Rover, Red Rover send to
Tricker Bobby immediately!

Hi, Sam had to leave
but leave your message, here comes the beep

Hi, I was not sure
out the correct number ...

But now I hear your voice
the message is that it is you

I! Chrissy, ie that
is waiting ...

Expecting a baby, and I also hope
show up as promised

In the old days ... I say we are not old
but if we are an old group

So I hope you come ... after all
A promise is a promise

Thomas Wolf once said
"You can not go home"

What is good for Tom, but it was a girl
he had made a pact with her friends ...

At the age of 12 years to meet when
some of them needed it.

So here I am, driving down
my childhood, somewhere in Indiana

A place you should know not wish to return.

So imagine that a promise
is a promise ...

I chose a bad day to quit.

Hi Doc Coming to Play?

Not today, I'm busy ... oh that's for me.

Good morning, Chrissy Is there anybody home?

One minute!

Now look at your shoulder, baby.

Hi, stop by the store and thought of you.

Thanks!

Do not go near the stove or operated

Very funny

But if this baby is born I will soon have
that out myself.

That would be nice.

"Where is the list?

I have.

What I can not believe it has to
people so excited?

Long legs, waist and beautiful breasts.
Roberta I do not like dirty things.

Chrissy's breasts are nothing dirty.

I can not hear!
Boobs!

I can not hear!
Boobs!

I can not hear!
Boobs!

Hello ... I'm glad to see you.

Hi Roberta, you look great.

How are you?
Well!

Photo!

And you, Look!

Thanks for coming.

Hey bitches.

Holy God!

How do you star?
Hi Roberta

Glad to see you.
Oh God!

Photo!

Look at your belly!
Tina Tercell!

Photo!

No, you look good!

Yes, I'm a supermodel

Glad to see you Teeny
It's been a long time

Go Girls enter.

Well, the weather turned.
It looks exactly like when you moved here.

You know what they say,
Like mother like daughter.

What I offer you a drink?

Whisky would be nice.
That I love.

We do not have these liqueurs at home.

Well what is right.

Beer, beer.

Cool.
Cool.

Okay.
Back in a second.

I was looking for one of these.

I can not believe that you've retained.
Morton wanted to throw it away and use the wood.

If you love.
But could not afford, well not mine.

It belongs to all.

I am so grateful you came.

Do not worry I think Chrissy will be a
great mother, a little heavy and stiff

But by the grace of God, the boy grow
relatively unharmed.

And if not, it is therapy.

I can not believe they expect a baby Chrissy
I feel so old.

All this puzzled me baby
ie they are educated

And inevitably something goes wrong, one is
Recently, the guilt makes us feel that way.

This crazy!
If you have a baby only perpetuates the vicious cycle.

Herod Thanks!

What are you working now Sam?
In another.

If you ask me, you should write something
that people can relate

I have not understood any of the things you
writing about aliens.

"I can take that as a compliment?

How about a romance novel as Danielle "
Steve? She really knows how to keep the emotion.

Roberta is true, the longer the
more books are sold.

You know something? I would like to see them more often.

What happened?

10 years ago who did not return.

Do not complain.
I'm sorry.

Roberta has chosen to be such ...

Alternative!

Living in sin with her boyfriend but is normal.

If I am normal.

There have been 4 failed marriages ...

Neither has completed a series of monogamous relationships ...

Not wearing black.

It's happy.
Technically, I have been married 3 times.

The first was annulled.

See?

You think everything is funny, if I
should ask mature.

Maybe it's true.

Indiana Shelby was not the place
exciting I know ...

In fact the most common cause of death before
of puberty, was boredom.

And in the days before MTV and Nintendo, we
to look as entertain.

The summer of 1970 began like any other summer
school was out ...

And we had 3 months of boredom, but that year was not enough freedom, wanted independence ...

Own place, so we decided to buy
a tree house ...

And the search for making money was the goal of the summer.

The 4 lived in a beautiful new neighborhood ...

Within a planned community and built ...

When everything came back
and the old things went.

I'm tired of this I do not listen anymore.
But ...

But what?
Calm down please.

I'm tired of talking about these things How many times we'll have this conversation?

Any partner is having trouble Why not
try to fix it?

We have tried too, is useless.
Maybe if you spend more time at home.

No! Say What for?

Come here

My parents had been fighting since
I have memory, I never bothered

It was actually the opposite, it was so comfortable
this consistency.

No matter what I do is get bigger.

Breakfast is cold, hurry

Roberta grew up with his father 3 older brothers
his mother died when she was 4 years old

That's his picture, never leaves home without it.

Tina, Tell us, did you feel at the exact moment
they knew you were chosen?

Well I can only say that I've dreamed of this day ...

... I've dreamed of this day since I have memory

Winning an Academy Award at such a young age
is an incredible achievement. Where will you go from here?

Teeny was an only child, his parents liked
meetings with her were never

They were gifted actors and pathological liars.

92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 ...

Chrissy, oh sorry darling "I can go?

Sure!

Oh shut this daughter, the discs become dusty

Oh oh, covered up and down okay?

Chrissy know ... I thought ... what I wonder

"About sex?

If you love, you mentioned and my mom is scared to say boo played! I felt so

Sorry Mom

Okay, okay, I think you're too young
to be informed

But your friends will tell lies
I think I'll give you the facts.

This will be a shock to you but ...

This is a flower ...

all women have a garden

And a garden needs a huge pipeline to water it ...

Or a little while to work ...

As a direct result of that conversation Chrissy spent part of his adult life obsessed with gardening.

These are worms, everyone in the neighborhood
Felt sorry for his mother.

Since we had a goal of summer, let us
life miserable.

They were the enemy

Hi dirty worm.

Now!

Chrissy down

Run, run.

"Roberta, are you okay?

We have a worm, and always get.

As if we were afraid of little girls

Best bear this

Your idea of ??an appointment is sensual: A) A light dinner
candlelight and a walk in the moonlight.

B) lie down on the skin of a bear
a cabin in the mountains.

C) Watch a sexy tape or
D) All of the above.

B

E, none of the above.

Roberta, this is not a possible answer

B then

Definitely A

Surprise, Surprise!

I choose D, the above

Surprise, Surprise!

Are 107 and 24 cents

How much more do we need?

23 more and the house will be ours
Hear the first night we'll have a party.

Oh Sam, your mom!

What are your short pants
What are your high boots.

Do not know why, but at the beginning of summer my mom
He began to dress like Nancy Sinatra

Wow your mom is great

Hey girls, today will be the full moon festival
of spirits returning to earth ...

And walk among the living

4 black cows is $ 1.90 children

We are girls

I know

It's too weird
What did you expect? It's a witch

I swear it Budu dolls and everything else

Listen to this

One of the dolls looked like the director Winters
And you know something?

Had a needle through his heart ...

I met him a day before the heart attack

Then do another session tonight?
It did not work last time and will not this time.

If it worked, this is the night that the barrier
between death and living can be broken

I read in the encyclopedia of supernatural phenomena.
You are so strange.

I come.
Yeah, me too.

Read the horoscope, Roberta, you're a woman, even your sensuality is hidden ...

You are like a volcano ready to erupt ... Wow Roberta beware.

It's rubbish.
Samantha walk the fine line between ...

Romanticism and sex appeal, not fear
to dive, might be surprised.

I'll keep that in mind.
Chrissy, making your dreams ...

Before you wilt like a flower.

What am I supposed to understand?

I go on, Teeny are a magnet for sex ...

What attracts men of the 4 points
cardinal, relax.

Back for the rest of my stuff when
girls leave home

No need to move out
Please already went through this not work, goodbye.

I decided not to tell my friends about my father

Call me silly but I thought it would.

That was a wish that I had for years

At that time none of our city had divorced

And what I wanted was to be different from my friends.

Well it's so cold here.
Take my shirt, I'll have cold, but you shut up.

It makes me look fat.
These fat.

I'm not fat ...

Do I look fat?

Take the hand of the person who is at his side
palm to palm.

Contact Marilyn Monroe.
Do not cooperated the last time.

No one ever cooperates.

Should contact someone buried
in this cemetery.

What about the dear Johnny?

DEAR JOHNNY MAY 22 1933 - October 1945 JUNE

Find out how he died

Close your eyes, guide to finding the spiritual world that our circle is safe from all evil and harm

Dear Johnny know you were a child when
let us know how you died.

I'm here.
Shut up! Concentrate.

Dear Johnny, did we hear? if so give us a sign

Okay just want to talk to you tell us how you died

This here ...

Says he wants to tell his story.
Chrissy.

I think we should stop.

Afraid

Tell him not to be afraid, it's all good.

This alone is very lonely, you need a friend.

The fool

Oh it hurts.
You deserve it and if you're fat.

Do not do it again.

Sorry ladies but they are so innocent about
these things, ie everything is fake.

Chrissy! Where you going?
Somebody stop it!

Chrissy, back!
Chrissy!

Let Sam!

Sam, let's go from here.
Look, there's someone else here, Look there!

Perhaps only the wind better let's go.
Sam Let's go, let's go!

Roberta, What are you doing? Why can not act
as a child?

Look what you've done.

What?

You know I hate getting dirty

It's nothing

The crazy Pette.

Let's cut way.
Let's go.

Base Chrissy, Chrissy basis,
Are you listening?, Change.

What?

We need to meet.

Now?

Remember I saw someone after the meeting?
I think it was in my room.

Who?
Dear Johnny.

Please, this was a bad idea
not a good idea

Shut up Chrissy! I do not want your complaints now.
Likewise.

Sam!, Are you okay?

Oh my God.
We did indeed make it.

He's back, we call it.

There's nothing about dear Johnny,
documents before 1948 were lost ...

In a fire, but Ms. Wendy Greenfield says the library has a copy of every newspaper in the county.

That settles it.
What do you manage?

We can not go by bicycle to Greenfield.

Or do you?

Truth or Dare, Roberta?
Truth

What size are your breasts?

Die

Have to say Is not Sam?

There has to say unless you want.

Can we see them?
No! They can not see them.

And yours grow?
Although I have not really.

The will, and hate.

No, you're lucky Roberta men like
great look at the size of mine.

They almost look real

Fill them with pudding.

"Pudding?

Worms gave me the idea

Gelatin is moving much

The pudding has a better texture

What flavor is it?

Vanilla.

Chrissy, "Truth or Dare?
Truth

Have you been given a French kiss?

Are you kidding? I do not get pregnant!

No one gets pregnant by a kiss.

I know, insect brain but everyone knows
that if you kiss and ...

... Automatically think you'll do with it, can not help it, they are driven, is his curse

"And what kind of relationship do you mean?

You know ... put the seed and watering the flower

What? Does not work that way?, Man carries
your hose and spray the flowers.

I think it's time to rest.
But we must come before lunch.

We continued Chrissy.
Well, go away, leave me here.

Chrissy!
I do not care I want to rest

Wait, listen, shut it.

It's beautiful

Wow.

Where did it fall?
Do not know.

What?

What?

Is in your hair

Quítenmelo!

This thin

Chrissy Calm

Watch below!

Roberta! There is deep

Where does he go?

Roberta!

Roberta!

Oh God

Roberta!

No!

Roberta!

Roberta!

Roberta!

You have to remove it.

Stop breathing!
Give him mouth to mouth

You do, I will rise again.
No, the opposite!

Take off!

Please Roberta.

Go! It's good to know my friends.

Do you know? I thought it
I, too, Roberta.

If clear Chrissy is the only one who cares about that ...

Chrissy!

Never again will you make us something to happen, never!
It was a joke

It was the first time that Roberta faked his death,
Earlier that year, we scared to jump off the roof ...

And pretend that he had broken his neck, had no
experienced a loss like Roberta ...

And we did not understand his jokes, but I wanted to
death seem funny ...

Perhaps to make it easier for her.

What was that?

Sorry, if it means anything to you really
thank you for trying to save.

But it scared me.
Sorry

Roberta, you're my best friend

If you have strength Chriss, Curse.

Roberta, do not curse.

Hey, check this out!

Oh my God!
What?

I saw his penis.
Who?

And his balls.
Who?

Scott.

Oh my God!

Of course, now I'm the one who has not seen Scott's team
which as will be the talk of the summer

I was forced to watch.
Chrissy nobody is forcing anything.

I have to look at but let me be very clear
I see under protest.

If course!

It is not very large.

What are you laughing?
Do you know? is not large, only when you have an erection.

When that happens it is of this size.
What is erection?

Your mother has not told you anything?

Beginning to believe my mom is ill-informed.

Hey girls.

Let's do it.

Friends get ready to run.

If you will be better than you get ahead
Do not send me an insect brain

No, I mean better go

This is too easy

Hey worms, time to pay
Come and get it sloppy.

Hey, back the clothes!
Not in your dreams, worm!

Let's go girls

Already we Chrissy

This does not stay well

Return the clothes

Please!

Come and get it

Come and get it

One for all and all for one.

GREENFIELD PUBLIC LIBRARY.

Hurry Chrissy.
Hey wait for me

I think I'm allergic to dust.

Nothing happened in April

Nothing ever happens here.
I prefer it that way

Nothing

COMMUNITY TEACHER DIES IN CRASH.

What happens?

It's Mom

It was a collision, the driver of the truck
fell asleep at the wheel ...

Was stuck in the car for an hour and a half
before the rescue ...

He was conscious as rescuers worked
out of its vehicle ...

He died that night at the county hospital of massive blows to the head and massive bleeding.

I do not understand, there is something wrong.
What are you talking?

It must have been horrible, felt pain.

She was very beautiful

It was a movie star.

Hey, I think I found something
Read it

On Saturday, funeral services were made to Jonathan Simmons 12 years and mother aged 36

Due to the tragic circumstances that led to his
death in the family has requested that the services are private

It's all, nothing more
How is everything? How did he die?

Wait ...

The pages were torn

Someone took the time to keep his death a mystery.

Hello

Hello

Not because he wanted

Are you injured?

Hey this is a great song

Smoking stops the growth

It is soft

Have you got the heart of honor?

If

Why not use it?

If this is a great honor it?

No

In the news says we are winning
ground in Vietnam

Forget it OK? forget what they say, forget what they see.

Those who were there lie to say that they saw

Do not think much about them I think.

You can believe in

If they are lucky ...

Will you stay here long?

No, I do not like to spend much time anywhere
You know what I mean?
