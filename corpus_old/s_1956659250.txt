(static buzzing)

Man#1:
DADDY?

Man #2:
IT'S OVER, KURT.

IT'S OVER.

Kurt: YOU DID THIS TO ME! (Shouts)
(gunshot)

(static buzzing)


(kids playing)
Man: You got it?

Woman:
What's today?

My birthday.
It is?!

How old are you today?
Five.

Are you excited?
Yes.


Ah, here we go.
For you.

Man:
Hey, Pat, looking good.

Back up, back up.
Woman: Hit it!

(Cheering)
Man: That's it, kid.

Okay, Sara?

Whoo, good job.

Man:
Go get the candy.

Woman:
Kurt, that's enough.

Pat!

What a beautiful
music box.

(Playing tune)

Kurt, sweetie, come on.
Give that back to Sara.

Kurt!
(Horn tooting)

(applause)
your candles.and blow out


Woman:
That was mean!

(Kid laughs)

(guests exclaim)
Kurt!

(Kurt laughing)
Okay, that is it!

(Laughing continues)

Man:
Sara, it's okay.

Woman:
Happy birthday, sweetie.


Kurt?
Kurt?

Kurt!

(Tape forwarding)

(door opens)

(music box playing)
Kurt?

I know you're probably
mad at Mommy,

but you know why I had
to bring you up here, right?

It was not very nice,
what you did to Sara.

And you're gonna have
to say you're sorry.

Honey, are you okay?

Kurt, look at me.

Kurt, what's wrong?

(Thuds)
(shouts)

(gasping, whimpering)

Sweetie, what are you doing?
(Crying)

(yelps, panting)

(choking, coughing)

(crying throughout)
throughout) playing

(thudding continues
throughout)

(static buzzing)

Woman: 911,
what's your emergency?

Sara: My mom's upstairs and she's hurt real bad.

Is she awake?

Can she talk to you?

She's on the floor.
There's lots of blood.

What's your name?
Sara.

How old are you, Sara?
Five.

It's my birthday.

Sara, we're starting
help for your mommy.

I need to find out
what's wrong with her.

Can you tell me what's
the matter with your mommy?

I don't know.
She's bleeding real bad.

Okay, sweetie.
With me.y on the line

An officer will be there
as soon as they can.

Don't hang up, Sara.
With me, okay? Ne

Okay.

Sara, is your
daddy home?

He's a policeman.
Is he there?

He's not home.
In the house with you?

My brother.

What's his name?
Kurt.

He was bad today.

Pat:
WHY DID HE DO THIS?

Woman:
IT'S COMPLICATED.

KURT'S MIND HAS FALLEN
INTO A DEEP PSYCHOSIS,

WHICH HAS DAMAGED
HIS BRAIN.

HIS MEMORIES HAVE BEEN
SEVERELY REPRESSED.

IT'S KURT'S WAY
OF COPING WITH--

WITH WHAT HE DID
TO HIS MOTHER.

Why did you kill
your mother, Kurt?

SO HE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

NO. YOUR SON APPEARS
TO BE SUFFERING

FROM A RARE FORM OF DISSOCIATIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER.

KURT IS CONFUSED.

HE HAS BURIED
SO MUCH OF HIS PAST

THAT HE HAS LOST HIS OWN SENSE OF IDENTITY.

HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO HE IS ANYMORE.

HIS SENSE OF REALITY
IS COMPLETELY DISTORTED.

HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHERE HIS OWN LIFE STOPS

AND WHERE THE REST
OF THE WORLD BEGINS.

IT'S AS THOUGH
HIS MIND WERE--

WERE TRAPPED
IN ANOTHER PLACE.

CAN YOU HELP HIM?

CAN YOU HELP
BRING HIM BACK?

I DON'T KNOW.

THERE'S NOTHING MORE
WE CAN DO HERE.

FAIRVIEW IS A MUCH
BETTER FACILITY.

IT'S A FULL SERVICE
MAXIMUM-SECURITY HOSPITAL.

WE'RE JUST NOT
EQUIPPED FOR...

FOR WHAT HE MIGHT
BE CAPABLE OF.

HE'LL GET THE BEST POSSIBLE
TREATMENT THERE.

I KNOW.

I JUST THOUGHT THERE WAS A CHANCE HE MIGHT GET BETTER.

WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

HE HASN'T RESPONDED
TO ANY OF THE TREATMENT.

HIS INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE HAS MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.

SO HE STILL HASN'T SPOKEN SINCE--
NOT A WORD.

THERE ARE SOME
TRANSFER PAPERS

IN MY OFFICE I WILL
NEED FOR YOU TO SIGN.

(Locks clank)
OKAY.

(Twig snaps)


(door opens)

HI, HONEY.
HI.

HOW DID IT GO?

AH, ABOUT HOW I EXPECTED.

UM, THEY FELT IT WOULD
BE MORE APPROPRIATE--

THEY'RE TRANSFERRING KURT
TO FAIRVIEW TONIGHT.

I'M SORRY.

I'M JUST GONNA GO CHANGE.

WHERE'S SARA?

WHERE DO YOU THINK?

* OH, I JUST WANT TO BE

* WHERE EVERYBODY ELSE BE

* WHOA, AT THE SPOT

* WHOA,
AT THE SPOT *

* THE SPOT,
OH, I JUST WANT TO GO... *

SO IS THE CAMPING STUFF
READY?

YES, IT'S IN THE GARAGE.

WHAT'S THE PLAN AGAIN?

WE'RE MEETING
THE GUYS AT 8:00,

DRINKING BY 8:10,
SETTING UP CAMP BY 8:20

AND GETTING IT ON BY 8:30.
(Giggles)

V, PUT THAT OUT.
WHAT?

WHAT A DRAG?
NO NO, COME ON.

JOLENE'S DOWNSTAIRS.
JUST NOT IN THE HOUSE.

OH, I KNOW YOU
WANT ONE.

WELL, I KNOW YOU'LL
WANT ONE AT 8:35,

RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME
PAUL FINISHES FILLING YOU UP.

MY GOD, YOU'RE SICK.

(Knocks)
Jolene: ARE YOU GIRLS ALMOST FINISHED IN THERE?

YOUR FATHER'S HOME.
YEAH, WE'RE JUST--

OH, WE'LL BE RIGHT OUT.


NOW WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU
TELL HER WE'RE DOING,

SO I CAN EARN
MY OSCAR NOMINATION?

WE'RE GOING TO THE MOVIES THEN WE'RE CRASHING AT YOUR HOUSE.

WONDERFUL, DARLING.

WHAT IF SHE TRIES TO CALL?
MAKE SOMETHING UP.

OR BETTER YET,
JUST DON'T ANSWER IT.

OKAY.

HAND ME MY CLOTHES.
YES, DARLING, RIGHT AWAY.

OKAY, THANK YOU.


(boy chattering)

GO LEFT.

THERE WE GO.

OH, PFFT!
(Laughter)

PAT?

PAT?

PAT.

(Door closes)

WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.
I WAS STARTING TO GET WORRIED.

VERY FUNNY.

HEY, VERONICA,
CAN I HELP YOU FIND SOMETHING?

NO NO, I'M GOOD.

YOU KNOW, IF YOU GUYS ARE HUNGRY,
I CAN MAKE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT.

SO WHAT TIME'S THE MOVIE?

8:00.
8:30.

THE MOVIE STARTS AT 8:00,

BUT WE PROBABLY HAVE
TO LEAVE LIKE 7:00.

BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
WE'LL GET SOMETHING WHILE WE'RE OUT.

YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY RATHER YOU ATE HERE
INSTEAD OF THE JUNK AT THE THEATER.

JOLENE, WE'LL BE FINE.
BESIDE WE DON'T HAVE TIME ANYWAY.

* Oooh, so fine
and sexy *

* Looking good
in leather and lace... *


(radio clicks off)

(thuds)
OH.

OH SHIT.


OH FUCK.

GOD DAMN IT.

HELLO?

JESUS!


OH MY GOD.
UH...

I'M SORRY.

GARY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

CUT ON YOUR HEAD.

GARY?
NO NO NO NO.

COME ON, MAN.
COME ON, STAY WITH ME, MAN.

GARY?



WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

YOU SCARED THE CRAP
OUTTA ME.

WHAT WAS THE DEAL
WITH YOUR BROTHER?

V, PUT THAT AWAY.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING AT THAT.

GOD, SARA,
I DIDN'T KNOW.

I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW
FUCKED UP YOUR BROTHER WAS.

YEAH YEAH, HE WAS FUCKED UP.
NOW PUT THAT AWAY BEFORE MY--

(door opens)
DAD.

I'M SORRY.
YOU JUST COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF, HUH, VERONICA?

JOLENE.
SHE CAN'T JUST COME IN HERE

AND START LOOKING AT OUR--
JOLENE.

IT'S OKAY.

SO WHERE ARE YOU GIRLS
GOING TONIGHT?

OH, NOWHERE SPECIAL.

JUST GOING TO HIT
SOME BARS,

HOOK UP WITH SOME GUYS,
SEE WHERE THE NIGHT TAKES US.

MAYBE NOT.

WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE MOVIES,
THEN I'M GONNA CRASH OVER AT V'S.

THAT'S RIGHT. I'VE GOTTA GET MY BAG.
COME ON, WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

I'LL HELP YOU.
WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO FORGET YOUR JAMMIES.

WHY DO YOU LET THEM
OFF SO EASY?

OH, HONEY, COME ON.
DON'T START, PLEASE.

I'M SERIOUS.
YOU HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

IF YOU DON'T SAY SOMETHING, I WILL.
JOLENE, I'LL HANDLE IT.

ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE OUT OF HERE. BYE.

BYE. HAVE FUN.
BE SAFE.

Both:
WE WILL.

SARA.
YEAH?

YOU GOT
YOUR CELL PHONE, RIGHT?

YEAH. SEE YOU TOMORROW.
LOVE YOU.

LOVE YOU TOO.
(Door closes)


WE GOT AWAY WITH IT.

HE WAS JUST LIKE, SARA--

GO GO.

OH SHIT.

THOUGHT YOU GIRLS
MIGHT NEED THIS.

BE SAFE, HONEY.

HAVE FUN.


OH, WOW.

YOUR DAD'S COOL,
FOR A COP.

SHUT UP.
(Laughing)

(patients moaning)

Man on P.A.: Dr.
Caoili to the lab, please.

Dr. Caoili to the lab.

(Screams)
(whistling)

Jolene: WHY DO YOU ALWAYS LET
THEM GET AWAY WITH EVERYTHING?

HONEY, YOU DO THIS
EVERY TIME.

YOU ARE ALWAYS MAKING
EXCUSES FOR HER.

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

IT'S LIKE YOU'RE AFRAID
OF BEING TOO HARD ON HER.

HONEY, SHE NEEDS
DISCIPLINE.

YEAH, WELL SHE GETS
PLENTY OF THAT.

BUT SHE'LL ONLY
LISTEN TO YOU.

SHE DOESN'T EVER
LISTEN TO ME.

SHE DOESN'T RESPECT ME.

AND SOMETIMES
I WONDER IF YOU DO.

OH, COME ON.
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

YEAH, I DO, BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE AFRAID.
AFRAID OF WHAT?

AFRAID THAT I MIGHT ACTUALLY DO A
BETTER JOB THAN HER REAL MOTHER.

I JUST GET
SO FRUSTRATED.

Dispatcher: All units we have a 318 in progress

at Yellow Glen Hospital.

EMT is en route
and requests assistance.

Suspect may be armed

All units please respond.

Dr. Engle:
THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE HIM

THAT WANTS TO GET OUT.

THERE'S SOMETHING
INSIDE OF HIM.

THANK GOD.

THOUGHT I LOST YOU

I'M SAM.
YOU'RE IN MY CAR.

I'M DRIVING YOU

YOU'RE LUCKY
I DIDN'T RUN YOU OVER.

WHAT WERE YOU DOING
BACK THERE ANYWAY?

I THOUGHT I WAS...

I THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.

YEAH, WELL,

IT WAS A CLOSE ONE
BACK THERE.

YEAH, IT WAS.

HE ALMOST GOT ME.

WHO?

YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM?

WHAT?

YEAH.

HE WAS CHASING ME.

NO.

I WAS CHASING HIM.

THEN HE PUSHED ME.

NO NO.

NO, THERE WAS
NO ONE THERE.

I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE.

YOU WERE ALONE.

PLEASE JUST TAKE ME HOME.

OKAY, UH...

(heavy breathing)



(wheel squeaking)

(Gary panting)

(heavy breathing)

I'M SUCH A NERD.

OH HEY,

THANKS, DARLING.

FIGURES.

SHAKE IT.

YOU SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

WHAT'S UP, BABY?
HI, SWEETIE.

Greg: CAMPING SHIT.
Veronica: WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

THIS MAN OVER HERE.

(Laughs)
(claps)

WE HAVE TO SHARE THAT ONE.
NICE, THANKS.

(Belches)
Veronica: NICE.


ARE YOU COMING?

YOU STILL MAD AT ME?

NO.
I JUST--

I'M JUST A LITTLE
FREAKED OUT.

JUST GOT A WEIRD FEELING
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

WE'RE SO CLOSE
TO MY HOUSE.

I JUST--
COME HERE.

COME HERE.

DON'T YOU WORRY YOUR PRETTY
LITTLE HEAD ABOUT A THING.

YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO THIS BEAUTIFUL BODY, RIGHT?

PAUL, I'M SERIOUS.
(Sighs)

ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S UP?

WHAT'S REALLY
BOTHERING YOU?

IT'S KURT.

YOUR BROTHER?
YEAH.

IT'S JUST THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN REALLY
WEIRD AROUND THE HOUSE LATELY...

ESPECIALLY WITH MY DAD.

LIKE TONIGHT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SIGN THE TRANSFER PAPERS FOR KURT.

AND THEN VERONICA WAS LOOKING AT
THE FILE AND THEN JOLENE GOT MAD.

SARA, SARA.

YOU HAVE TO LET IT GO.

I KNOW HE'S YOUR BROTHER,

BUT IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

I JUST HATE TO SEE
YOU GET ALL WORKED UP.

I KNOW.

I GUESS I'M JUST REALLY
KIND OF NERVOUS ABOUT...

YOU KNOW, TONIGHT.

OKAY.

LISTEN, I DON'T WANT
YOU TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS
IF YOU'RE NOT READY.

LET'S JUST
HAVE FUN, OKAY?

OKAY.

DOES MY SARA GIRL NEED
A LITTLE LIQUID COURAGE?

AS A MATTER OF FACT,
SHE DOES.


DON'T WORRY, GUYS.
WE'VE GOT THIS.

OH!

COME ON.

Dr. Engle:
HE'S LOST HIS OWN SENSE.

Denton:
IT'S KURT.

(Siren wailing)

(radio chatter)

WHERE'S THE GUARD?

HE'S BACK BY THE REAR ENTRANCE
JUST STRAIGHT DOWN THE HALL.

TAKE THE MEDICS.
THIS WAY, GUYS.

(Door buzzes)

(radio chatter)

OKAY, TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

WELL, I'M NOT
REALLY SURE.

KURT WAS SCHEDULED
TO BE TRANSFERRED.

HE WAS BEING HELD MEDICATED
IN THE DETAINMENT ROOM.

THERE WERE TWO ARMED GUARDS
WHO WERE ASSISTING--

WAIT WAIT WAIT,
SLOW DOWN. SLOW DOWN.

KURT?
HE'S A PATIENT.

NOT KURT BAKER?
YEAH.

OH SHIT.

SO YOU KNOW
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

AT SOME POINT HE MUST HAVE
ATTACKED THE GUARDS.

THERE WERE TWO
SECURITY GUARDS?

YES, ONE IS DOWN,
THE OTHER ONE'S MISSING.

HE'S NOT ANSWERING
HIS RADIO.

IS IT POSSIBLE HE MAY
HAVE GONE AFTER HIM?

THAT'S DEFINITELY
A POSSIBILITY.

NURSE, COULD YOU GET THESE PATIENTS TO THEIR ROOMS, PLEASE?

I'M TRYING, LINDA.

COME ON, GUYS.
LET'S GO.

DISPATCH, WE HAVE A SITUATION AT YELLOW GLEN.

ONE SECURITY GUARD IS DOWN,
THE OTHER IS MISSING.

COULD POSSIBLY BE IN PURSUIT,
BUT THERE'S NO CONTACT AT THIS TIME.

Dispatcher:
Affirm, 1540.

We have reports
of a one-car rollover accident

on Highway 10
east of milepost 13.

Available units
please respond.

PARSONS, YOU GOT THIS?
Yeah.

THANKS.

THE SECURITY GUARD'S DEAD.

OH MY GOD.

OKAY, SEAL OFF THIS AREA.
I WANT EVERYBODY OFF THIS FLOOR.

OKAY.

MOORE, CAN YOU HELP
THEM THERE?

YEAH.

HEY, PAT.

WE HAVE A HOMICIDE HERE.

OKAY, LET'S GET
OUR K9 UNIT UP THERE

AND I WANT A TWO-MILE PERIMETER AROUND THE HOSPITAL.

EVERYBODY'S ON THIS.
10-4.

HEY, PAT.

GO AHEAD.

IT'S KURT.


DID YOU COPY THAT?

YEAH.

I COPY.

PAT, I'M--

I'M SORRY.

WE'LL FIND HIM.

I KNOW.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

(Crickets chirping)

I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

SOMETHING LIKE THIS
COULD HAPPEN.

EXCUSE ME, LINDA.
GARY'S WIFE IS ON THE PHONE.

WHAT SHOULD I TELL HER?

IS THIS GARY?
NO.

GARY IS THE ONE
WHO'S MISSING.

I'LL HANDLE IT.

MOORE.
YEAH?

I WANT YOU TO MAKE
A SWEEP OF THE GROUNDS.

MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S
WHERE THEY NEED TO BE.

LOOK FOR CLUES--
WHATEVER YOU CAN FIND.

(Footsteps crunching)


Dr. Engle:
THIS IS IT.

PAT.

I'M-- I'M SO SORRY.

IT'S ALL RIGHT.

LANE, I WANT TO
KEEP THIS LOW-KEY.

I DON'T WANT ANY OUTSIDE
DEPARTMENTS ON THIS

AND I WANT
SAFETIES ON, OKAY?

RIGHT, CHIEF.

CAN I HAVE
A MOMENT ALONE?

PLEASE?

OF COURSE.

(Door shuts)

(radio flickers)
JESUS!

Baker, this is Parsons.
Come in.


GO AHEAD.

I'M DOWN HERE
AT THE CAR ACCIDENT.

THE DRIVER'S BEEN KILLED.

Pat:
Can you take care of it?

SHERIFF, I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA WANT TO SEE THIS.

WHAT IS IT?

WELL, WE FOUND
A NAME TAG IN THE CAR

WITH THE NAME
GARY JORDAN.

OH, JESUS.


(door creaks)

HELLO?

IS ANYONE HERE?

(Door slams)

(bottle rattles)

HELLO?

COME ON.

COME ON,
RING, DAMN IT.

(Service hose dinging)

(phone ringing)

911, what is the nature
of your emergency?

(Service hose dinging)
Hello? Hello?

OH, GOD.

WHY?



AH!


OH GOD.
SHIT.




(Kurt laughing)


I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT.

DOES HIS GIRLFRIEND KNOW
THAT HE DID THAT?

I JUST TELL IT
LIKE I SEE IT.

OH, I THINK
I'M GONNA TELL HER.

I'M FREEZING.

HEY, I KNOW A WAY
TO WARM YOU GUYS UP.

Sara:
YEAH, I'LL BET YOU DO.

EVERY TIME I FART,
EVERYBODY DRINKS.

ARE YOU READY?
AND HOW OLD ARE WE?

I CANNOT BELIEVE
I ACTUALLY SLEEP WITH YOU.

(Farts)
(groans)

EVERYBODY DRINK.
OOOH!

THAT IS SO WRONG.

ROAR.

OH MY GOD,
THAT REMINDS ME.

I HAVE TO TELL
YOU GUYS THIS.

LAST WEEK I WENT
IN FOR MY PAP SMEAR.

YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING
WE ALL NEED TO HEAR ABOUT.

NO NO, LISTEN.
I GO IN,

THE NURSE TELLS ME TO TAKE OFF ALL
MY CLOTHES AND PUT ON THIS GOWN.

SO I'M SITTING ON THE TABLE,
MY BARE ASS IS HANGING OUT

AND THE DOCTOR COMES IN.

HE TELLS ME TO LAY BACK AND PUT MY FEET UP IN THE STIRRUPS.

SO I LAY BACK,
SPREAD MY LEGS,

PROP MY FEET
UP IN THE STIRRUPS

AND HE'S DOWN THERE.

YOU KNOW,
HE'S DOWN THERE.

HIS HEAD IS DOWN
THERE AND HE GOES,

"OH MY.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO NUMB YOU UP FOR THIS ONE."

I'M THINKING,
"OH MY GOD. NUMB ME UP?

I'VE NEVER HAD TO DO THIS BEFORE.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?"

SO HE TELLS ME
TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH

AND IT'LL ALL BE OVER
BEFORE I KNOW IT.

SO I TAKE A DEEP BREATH,
HE PUTS HIS HEAD IN THERE

AND GOES,
"NUMB NUMB NUMB NUMB."


THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA
DO TO YOU LATER.

OH, YOU KNOW IT, HONEY.
(Laughs)

I CAN'T FIND MY--

Greg:
LET'S GO RIGHT NOW.

Veronica:
OKAY.

HEY, GUYS.

I'VE GOT A RUNNER
ON DECK.

NO. NO.
OH, NO.

NO NO NO NO.
NO NO NO, WAIT.

(Farts)
(laughing)


I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
JUST DID THAT AGAIN.


OH, THAT'S SO GROSS.

DRINK.

HONEY, ONE MORE OF THOSE AND YOU'RE GOING TO SIT BY YOURSELF.


(phone ringing)

HEY.

DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
Yeah.

WELL, I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU,
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

He's escaped.

WHAT?

UH, LOOK I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO GET INTO IT RIGHT NOW.

JUST SOMETHING WENT WRONG
DURING THE TRANSFER.

What are you guys
going to do?

WE'RE TRACKING HIM RIGHT NOW.
WE'LL CATCH HIM.

YOU DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA
TRY TO COME HERE, DO YOU?

No, no I don't think so.

JESUS, HONEY.

(Locks click)

DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIND HIM.

I'VE GOT TO GO, OKAY?
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

OKAY.
I LOVE YOU.

YEAH, I LOVE YOU TOO.

HONEY.
YEAH?

ABOUT EARLIER...

I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT
TO COME OUT THAT WAY.

I KNOW.

I'LL CALL YOU
IN A LITTLE BIT.

Bye.

(Radio chatter)

SO WHAT DO WE GOT?

WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
THE SECURITY GUARD WAS DOING OUT HERE.

ANY IDEAS
AS TO THE CAUSE OF THIS?

THAT'S JUST IT-- I DON'T THINK THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT.

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

I MEAN,
JUDGING FROM THE NECK WOUNDS ON THE DRIVER,

HE WAS STABBED AND MURDERED
BEFORE THE CAR EVEN CRASHED.

IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.

SO WE'VE GOT TO ASSUME
THAT OUR SUSPECT

AND THE SECURITY GUARD WERE BOTH IN
THE CAR WHEN THIS ACCIDENT HAPPENED.

SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
THEY HITCHED A RIDE OR SOMETHING?

SHERIFF, THE K9 UNIT
JUST PICKED UP A SCENT

JUST BELOW THE TREE LINE.

SOMEBODY'S ALIVE
OUT THERE.

LET'S FIND OUT
WHO IT IS.

DONNY.
DONNY, COME HERE.

YEAH?

I NEED YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR.
SURE.

YOU KNOW WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR, RIGHT?
YEAH.

I WANT YOU TO GO
TO MY HOUSE.

BUT DON'T YOU THINK I SHOULD HELP OUT WITH THE SEARCH PARTY?

I KNOW.
I JUST WANT TO BE SAFE.

OKAY.

DO YOU THINK HE MIGHT--
I'M NOT SURE.

I JUST WANT YOU THERE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS, OKAY?

ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

HEY, DONNY.
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

I DON'T WANT TO UPSET MY WIFE.
OH, OKAY.

JUST HANG OUT BY THE END
OF THE DRIVEWAY.

I'LL HEAD THERE RIGHT NOW.
THANKS, DON.

SURE.

THIS GUY, HE CAME
YELLING OUT OF THE WOODS.

PAUL AND GREG WENT
OUT TO HELP HIM!

WHAT?
OH MY GOD!

OH MY GOD.
GET YOUR HANDS UP!

NO NO NO! NO! NO NO NO!
GET 'EM UP!

NO, IT'S OKAY.
HE HELPED US.

OH MY GOD.

YOU KNOW,
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU TONIGHT, GARY.

WHERE'S KURT?

WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

KURT?
I-- I DON'T KNOW.

WE-- WE LOST HIM.

KURT?

BAKER, THIS IS PARSONS.
COME IN.

(Radio crackling)
THIS IS BAKER. GO AHEAD.

YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS.

WHAT THE...?

SHERIFF, THEIR--
THEIR BOYFRIENDS ARE DEAD.

OH NO.

ARE THE GIRLS OKAY?
Yeah.

WHAT ABOUT GARY?

HE'S PRETTY BEAT UP,
BUT HE'S ALIVE.

WELL, TALK TO HIM
AND FIND OUT WHAT HE KNOWS.

YOU'VE GOT IT.

IS THAT KURT?
Send the girls up to the house right away.

And in the meantime,
keep your eyes open.

IS THAT MY BROTHER?
Good work, Parsons.

IS THAT MY BROTHER?!

GO TO THE HOUSE
AND LOCK YOUR DOORS.

(Crying) IS THAT MY BROTHER?
GO. NOW!

JOLENE!
OH MY GOD!

WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

JOLENE,
TAKE THE GIRLS INSIDE.

(Girls crying)
COME ON. COME ON, GIRLS.

ALL RIGHT. WE'VE GOT
A POSITION ON KURT.

LET'S MOVE.

OKAY, COME ON.

I WANT YOU TO SIT DOWN
AND KEEP WARM.

COME ON.
(Phone rings)

IT'S YOUR FATHER.

Pat!
HEY, HONEY. ARE THE GIRLS WITH YOU?

THANK GOD, PAT.
THEY'RE OKAY.

I'M NOT OKAY! PAUL AND GREG ARE DEAD!
SHH SHH SHH.

Jolene:
What's happening?

FIRST OF ALL, DON'T WORRY.
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.


KURT'S OUT THERE.
PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

HE ALMOST KILLED SARA.

WE'LL FIND HIM.
JUST KEEP THE GIRLS CALM.

WE KNOW WHERE KURT IS
AND WE'RE MOVING...

(static crackling)

HONEY? PAT?

FUCK. JOLENE?

HONEY?
JO-- JESUS.

COME ON, COME ON.

HERE, GIRLS.

DRINK THIS.

IT'S KURT, ISN'T IT?

Jolene: WHAT?

I HEARD DONNY.

HE SAID KURT'S
THE ONE DOING THIS.

IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

YES, IT'S TRUE.

HE KILLED THEM.

MY FUCKING PSYCHO
BROTHER KILLED PAUL.

OH, HOW COULD
DAD LET THIS HAPPEN?

YOUR DAD IS DOING
EVERYTHING HE CAN.

THIS IS NOT
HIS FAULT.

WHAT WERE YOU DOING UP IN THOSE WOODS IN THE FIRST PLACE?

NOTHING. WE WERE--
WE WERE JUST--

JUST WHAT?
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO THE MOVIES.

JOLENE, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

YOU LIED TO ME!
IT'S-- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

YOU ALMOST
GOT KILLED TONIGHT.

YOU CALL THAT
NO BIG DEAL?

YOU DON'T GET IT.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT!

I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO LET KURT GET OUT.

ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

I AM SO TIRED OF YOUR LIES AND YOUR EXCUSES.

EVERYTHING IS
SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT.

NOTHING'S YOUR FAULT EVER.
GIVE ME A BREAK! JESUS!

A BREAK?

OH, I'M SORRY.
HAVEN'T YOU HAD ENOUGH BREAKS?

NOT WITH YOU AROUND.

NO MATTER WHAT I SAY...

YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME.

YOU LET VERONICA

TALK YOU INTO GOING
UP INTO THE WOODS

WITH THOSE BOYS
DOING WHO KNOWS WHAT.

AND NOW LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.
THAT IS-- THAT IS NOT FAIR!

STOP IT! STOP IT!
(Knocks on door)

WHO IS IT?
JOLENE?

Gary:
IT'S ME.

THAT'S GARY,
THE GUY WHO HELPED US.

ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH, LET HIM IN.

PLEASE.

(Door opens)
Jolene: OH, JESUS.

(Grunts)
WHAT HAPPENED?

SARA, GO GET ME SOME WET TOWELS.
YEAH?

Sara: OKAY.
GET THE FIRST-AID KIT FROM THE BATHROOM TOO.

Sara:
SURE.

OKAY.

SO I WANT YOU
TO APPLY SOME PRESSURE.

THAT SHOULD HELP STOP THE BLEEDING.
ALL RIGHT.

YOU GOT IT?
YEAH.

(Moans)
SORRY.

I'M GONNA TRY TO REACH
YOUR FATHER AGAIN.

Man over radio:
Southeast office.

Dispatcher: 0770.

(Bushes rustling)


THANK YOU.

YOU'RE WELCOME.

I GUESS I SHOULD BE
THE ONE THANKING YOU.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD'VE DONE IF YOU HADN'T HELPED US.

HERE.

HE'S MY BROTHER,
YOU KNOW.

I KNOW.

I'M SORRY.

IT'S OKAY.

IT'S JUST KIND OF CREEPY,
YOU KNOW?

I BARELY
EVEN REMEMBER HIM.

ONE DAY
IT JUST HAPPENED.

IT WAS
MY FIFTH BIRTHDAY.

THEY TOOK HIM AWAY
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE.

YOU PROBABLY KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN I DO.

YEAH. A LITTLE.

I GREW UP HEARING
STORIES ABOUT HIM.

I GET SO MUCH CRAP.

"THE SISTER OF THAT PSYCHO KID WHO KILLED HIS MOM."

AFTER A WHILE, PEOPLE KIND
OF FORGOT ABOUT HIM.

SO DID I.

I FIGURED I'D NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.

AT LEAST
I HOPED I WOULDN'T.

(Water patters)

HOW DID HE GET OUT?

GARY?

EVERYBODY GET DOWN.
HE'S OUTSIDE.


JOLENE!

NO, WHAT ABOUT DONNY?

I DON'T SEE HIM.
GET AWAY FROM THE WINDOW.

BEHIND YOU!


COME ON!
COME ON!

WHERE DID HE GO?
Gary: I DON'T KNOW.

COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

NO.

LEAVE US ALONE!
Gary: QUIET.

(Footsteps thudding)

Sara: NO.

(Door rattles)

(body thuds)

Sara: NO.

DON'T LEAVE US!
(Whispers) QUIET. JUST...

WAIT.

JOLENE.

(Girls screaming)

CLOSE THE DOOR!
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!


LOCK IT.

Gary:
WAIT WAIT WAIT.


HE'S GONE.

GIRLS,
GET UP THE STAIRS,

GET IN THE BATHROOM
AND LOCK THE DOOR.

JOLENE?
DO WHAT HE SAYS.

COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

COME ON.


WHY?

WHY?!

I DON'T KNOW.

IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

HE'S GONNA KILL US.
WE'RE GONNA DIE.

WE'RE DEAD.
SHH SHH SHH.

NO, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
NO, IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.
I DON'T WANNA DIE.

SHH SHH.
V, LOOK AT ME.

LOOK. LOOK.

LOOK. WE'VE GOTTA

OKAY? I NEED YOU
TO BE STRONG FOR ME.

OKAY? OKAY?

(Crying)

VERONICA,
LISTEN TO ME.

IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS.

IT'S GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.

(Dog barking)

(radio chatter)

OKAY, THIS IS IT, EVERYBODY.
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

(Dog whining)

(dog barking)
Officer: SHERIFF, OVER HERE!

JESUS! JESUS CHRIST!
(Gagging)

DENTON, GET A MEDIC
OVER HERE NOW!


OH, KURT,

(Radio chatter)

I'LL GO CHECK
THE BACK.

DO YOU HAVE
ANOTHER GUN?

NO.

COME ON, COME ON.

OKAY, I WANT YOU
TO GRAB THE DOG,

SEARCH THAT AREA OVER THERE.
PAT.

YEAH, WHAT IS IT?
THEY FOUND ANOTHER BODY AT YELLOW GLEN

JUST OUTSIDE THE MAIN GROUNDS.
ANOTHER BODY?

AT THE HOSPITAL?
I THOUGHT EVERYONE WAS ACCOUNTED FOR.

IT WAS THE OTHER SECURITY GUARD.
ANOTHER SECURITY GUARD?

BUT THERE WAS ONLY--
(cell phone ringing)

OH MY GOD.


JOLENE--
HONEY?

JOLENE, LISTEN TO ME.

GET OUT OF--

(static hissing)
PAT?

HELLO?

(Dripping loudly)

OH MY GOD.
JOLENE.

(Kurt breathing heavily)

(Veronica screaming)

(sighs)



GARY!

(Grunting)
(screaming)


(music box playing)

YOU REMEMBER THIS,
DON'T YOU?

FROM MY BIRTHDAY PARTY?

KURT, LOOK AT ME.

YEAH, IT'S ME, SARA.

YOUR LITTLE SIS.

IT'S OKAY.

DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

REMEMBER ALL THE FUN
WE USED TO HAVE

PLAYING ON THE SWINGS
IN THE BACKYARD?

SARA?

YEAH, IT'S ME.
IT'S OKAY.

I-- I'M SORRY.

I DIDN'T MEAN IT.
NO NO, I KNOW.

IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S NOT.

I KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU.

I KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

(Music stops)

NO.

KURT, I KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

KURT, I KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU.

NO!
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

SHUT UP!

YOU SHUT UP!

NO!

KURT?
SHUT UP!

KURT! NO!

(Scissors thud)

(groans)
(Sara screams)

DADDY?

IT'S OVER, KURT.

IT'S OVER.

YOU DID THIS TO ME!


Pat's voice:
IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
(Kurt gasping)

IT'S OKAY.


NOW REMEMBER, KURT,

DON'T TELL
ANYBODY ABOUT THIS.

THIS IS
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

NOT A WORD.

Mother: YOU'D BETTER STILL BE IN YOUR ROOM WHEN I GET UP THERE.

KURT?

Pat: BETTER PULL YOUR PANTS UP.

SIT THERE
AND BE A GOOD BOY.

KURT?

I KNOW YOU'RE
PROBABLY MAD AT MOMMY.

BUT YOU KNOW WHY I HAD TO BRING YOU UP HERE, RIGHT?

IT WAS NOT VERY NICE,
WHAT YOU DID TO SARA.

AND YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

HONEY,
ARE YOU OKAY?

KURT, LOOK AT ME.

KURT, WHAT'S WRONG?

(Bat thuds)

Pat: OH, KURT,
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

DADDY.

WHAT...

(siren blaring)

Pat: SO HE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

Dr.
Engle: AT SOME POINT HE MUST'VE ATTACKED THE GUARDS.

Pat: IT'S KURT,
HE'S ESCAPED.

Dr. Engle:
KURT IS CONFUSED.

HIS SENSE OF REALITY
IS COMPLETELY DISTORTED.

HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO HE IS ANYMORE.

HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

WHERE HIS OWN
LIFE STOPS

AND WHERE THE REST
OF THE WORLD BEGINS.

Medic #1: OKAY, GUYS,
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

(Heart monitor beeping)
Medic #2: GUNSHOT WOUND.


Medic #1: ALL RIGHT, DOES HE HAVE A PULSE?
Medic #2: NO PULSE.

Medic #1: NO SIGN OF SINUS RHYTHM.
WE'RE GONNA START COMPRESSIONS.

DADDY?
(Flatlining)

Medic #1: CHARGE 200.
Medic #2: 200 CHARGING.

Medic #1: CLEAR!
(Defibrillator sparks)

IT'S OVER, KURT.

IT'S OVER.

YOU DID THIS TO ME.

(gunshot)
(flatlining)

Medic #1: OKAY,
LET'S GET 200 OF EPI--

Medic #2: GOT IT.
HE'S NOT BREATHING.

Medic #1:
ALL RIGHT, CHARGE 300.

Medic #2: 300 CHARGING.
Medic #1: TRY IT AGAIN.

CLEAR!
(Defibrillator sparks)


Dr.
Engel: YOUR SON APPEARS TO BE SUFFERING

FROM A RARE FORM OF DISSOCIATIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER.

KURT IS CONFUSED.

HE'S LOST HIS OWN
SENSE OF IDENTITY.

HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO HE IS ANYMORE.

HIS SENSE OF REALITY IS
COMPLETELY DISTORTED.

HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHERE HIS OWN LIFE STOPS

AND WHERE THE REST
OF THE WORLD BEGINS.

IT'S AS THOUGH
HIS MIND WERE--

WERE TRAPPED
IN ANOTHER PLACE--

WERE TRAPPED
IN ANOTHER PLACE--

TRAPPED
IN ANOTHER PLACE.

Veronica: WHAT WAS THE DEAL WITH YOUR BROTHER?

Jolene: KURT'S OUT THERE.
PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

Denton:
KURT? NOT KURT BAKER?

Paul:
I KNOW HE'S YOUR BROTHER,

BUT IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

Sam:
I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE.

YOU WERE ALONE.

Sara: I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

I KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

IT'S NOT
YOUR FAULT.

HEY, I'M HOME.
HI, HONEY.

HEY, HONEY.
HEY, SARA.

HI, DAD.

IS HE UPSTAIRS?
MM-HMM.

(Instrumental music playing)
