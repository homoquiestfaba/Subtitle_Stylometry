<i>My Dear Holmes, today I walked
14 miles across rough terrain</i>

<i>and hardly a twinge from
either my leg or my shoulder.</i>

<i>The landscape is as handsome
as it is reported.</i>

<i>I still entertain the hope that
I can prevail upon you to join me.</i>

<i>I appreciate, of course that the
beauties of nature mean little to you,</i>

<i>but I believe you would have found some
of the guests at my hotel most intriguing.</i>

<i>Moral splendor is on display in the
person of the striking Major Shlessinger,</i>

<i>a hero of the Boer War,</i>

<i>sadly crippled in the defense of Ladysmith
and now engaged in charitable work.</i>

<i>His nurse is a Miss Calder
whose attentiveness suggests not only</i>

<i>that she is his disciple but also
that tenderer feelings may be involved.</i>

<i>Most fascinating of all, however,
is an extraordinary woman,</i>

<i>one who would stand out
in any society,</i>

<i>the Lady Frances Carfax.</i>

<i>I suppose one would call her modern</i>

<i>except that she seems to come from
an ancient line of English eccentrics.</i>

<i>Yesterday, as if to confirm
the general opinion of her oddity,</i>

<i>she declared that she would sail herself
to church across the lake.</i>

<i>There was much speculation
in the hotel carriage</i>

<i>as we traveled towards the charming
little lakeside chapel</i>

<i>about whether Lady Frances
would be as good as her word.</i>

<i>And those of us foolish enough to
doubt her were soon rebuked</i>

<i>by the sight of a skiff moored
in the shallows</i>

<i>and by the stern gaze of its captain
when she greeted us within.</i>

A surprisingly jolly sermon, Vicar,
I laughed like a cat.

<i>Well, she appears to care not a jot
what her fellow guests make of her</i>

<i>and seems quite insensible to
the vivid impression</i>

<i>she creates wherever she goes.</i>

<i>We were all amused, certainly, at the
sight of her trying to board the skiff,</i>

<i>but since she had accomplished
the outward journey with such skill,</i>

<i>we had no reason to suppose
that her return voyage</i>

<i>would present her with
any greater difficulty,</i>

<i>or that it would end
in the way that it did.</i>

<i>I had decided to
walk back across the fill</i>

<i>so I was not amongst
those who waited</i>

<i>to cheer Lady Frances
on her return.</i>

<i>I arrived a little later</i>

<i>at exactly the moment when
tragedy threatened to strike.</i>

Help!

Help, here!

Help!

I was helpless, my dear Holmes,
helpless.

I have never felt so powerless
in my life,

as powerless, so I thought,
as the old soldier in his wheelchair

who had only been able to shout,
it seemed, for help.

As with many men, I have noticed
a weakness in one part of the body

is compensated by
great strength elsewhere.

Unable to walk,

Shlessinger was yet able to swim
powerfully with his arms alone.

Reinforcements arrived in
due course from the hotel,

and tragedy was happily averted.

Now, all parties are recovered,

it is reported that the Lady Frances
is resentful of her rescue

as if her suffragette principles
had been somehow compromised.

All agree at any rate that Major
Shlessinger is the hero of the hour.

Miss Calder's attentions are now
translated into patent adoration.

No doubt further praise
will be in order

when he lectures on his missionary
activities at the hotel tomorrow.

He is, by the way,
the British representative of

the Mission Church of
Christ the Healer

whose theater works
in the high Andes of Peru.

Morning.

Major Shlessinger is avoiding me.

The poor man is embarrassed by
his own heroism.

Perhaps he now thinks I'm obliged to
contribute to his work.

Men have such extraordinary
weaknesses.

Don't you think?

Oh, yes, certainly, we do,
of course, I agree.

Would you care to take a turn
by the lake, Doctor?

Major Shlessinger works tirelessly
for his church, does he not?

I understand the need for
funds is considerable.

He's lecturing on his cause
tomorrow here in the hotel

hoping to raise some money.

He'll do well.

The local matronage will happily part
with half a guinea each

for the company of such a man
albeit in public.

Do I shock you?

Not at all.

I shock my brother.

As the Earl of Rufton, I think
he feels it is his duty to be shocked.

Oh, it's very beautiful here,
isn't it?

I spent every summer of
my childhood here by this lake.

It's very beautiful.

It is indeed.

He's to visit me tomorrow.

Who?
My brother.

That is duty, too, of course.

Damn him.

Damn him!

Ah, Lady Frances!

What a pleasant surprise!

<i>I must confess that her behaviour
continues to fascinate me.</i>

<i>I grant that her reaction to this
unknown horseman was extreme,</i>

<i>but many of her reactions are.</i>

<i>Had she known him, I wonder?</i>

<i>What lies in her past to
prompt this fear of him?</i>

<i>In looking for an explanation,</i>

<i>I am placing some hopes in the visit
we expect this afternoon</i>

<i>from her brother, the Earl of Rufton.</i>

<i>By all accounts, his oddities are
of an entirely different order</i>

<i>from those of his sister.</i>

<i>Where she flouts convention,</i>

<i>he has raised the conventions of
a former era to the status of a faith.</i>

<i>As for myself, I notice
an increasing indifference</i>

<i>to the natural beauty
which lies about me.</i>

<i>My thoughts return constantly
to the Lady Frances.</i>

<i>There is something about her life
which prompts my sympathy, some-</i>

<i>unhappiness I can sense
which I would dearly like to dispel.</i>

<i>It is to be hoped that her spirits
will be lifted by her brother's visit,</i>

<i>for she remains subdued
from yesterday's strange encounter.</i>

<i>Who is he, Holmes?</i>

<i>Why does he not wish
to make himself known?</i>

Why indeed?

Watson, you're a brick,

I came here, Fanny, to see how
you were, not to be lectured.

It's not a lecture,
it's a request.

It sounds like a lecture.

It's quite simple,
I need some money.

Just like that?

I suppose you've been overdoing it
again, haven't you?

I do not "overdo" it, John.

If I have ever overspent the wretched
allowance you give me,

it's because someone
has been in need.

Oh, yes,
your famous heart of gold,

except that it's my money
and there isn't any.

You know perfectly well there isn't.
The hall is falling to bits.

There's a family of owls
in the East Wing and you think...

What is it this time?
Helping penniless poets in Islington?

You only know how to be cruel,
don't you?

When have you ever cared for
what I want?

The last 15 years of my life
have been wretched.

And now, at last, I had a chance

to make something of it. Doesn't that
have any meaning for you?

Good afternoon.

The difference it makes is that
I'm being told what to do.

You know I loathe it.

The trouble is you won't even
take advice, will you?

You've been offered everything.
You've turned it all down.

What have I been offered?
Marriage. Good marriages.

To be the unpaid slave of
a titled yokel

who hasn't even read a book,

who thinks Bach is
something terriers do?

All right, all right.

What have you got against
me doing this? What?

I want to get out of this
miserable mess my life is in,

to be my own woman,
for God's sake,

to fulfill just a portion of my life.

Why do you always hold me back?

Think of it, John, think of it.

Just one payment. One.

You could see the back
of me forever.

The mule express,
as we have dubbed it,

brings the mail once a month,
letters, of course,

and food for the mind from
the Library of Christ.

And medicines for
the well being of my flock

whom you may see here
posing outside the mission

below a temporary belfry.

When I show you the next picture

of a leading member
of my congregation,

you will understand how the parable
of the shepherd and the lost sheep

has become transmuted
in our teaching

into that of the llama herd
and the lost llama.

And finally, our church.

Humble as it is rough
and poor indeed,

I'm proud to tell you that
the word of God

is preached as fervently
within its walls

and is as joyously received there

as in any great cathedral
here at home.

Thank you, thank you.
It was inspiring as I predicted.

I regret to say that
the rigours of his itinerary

press hard upon Major Shlessinger

who will shortly be departing
for Whitehaven.

We shall be taking up a collection

on behalf of his estimable mission,
of course.

What do you mean?

I mean that the remedy lies
in your own hands.

How?

You know how.

If you're really serious,
you'll know what to do! Damn it!

I'm sick of you coming to me
with these crackpot notions.

You know my responsibilities.

If you hadn't thrown
away all your chances,

you wouldn't be
in this position now.

Well, I've had enough.

You know what you have to do.
Grow up and do it!

My last resort.

My very last resort!
How can you suggest it?

Groom!

Groom!

Where the devil are you?

In which room is Mr. Shlessinger's
meeting taking place?

I am afraid the meeting finished
half an hour ago, Madam.

Mr. Shlessinger will have left for
Whitehaven by now.

Oh, yes. Yes, I've forgotten.
Thank you.

Lady Frances!

Leave me alone.

Excuse me.

You, sir!

<i>I've no doubt you will tell me
my fears are unfounded, Holmes,</i>

<i>but the repeated appearance of this
man has cast a shadow over her life</i>

<i>which, try as she might,
she cannot lift.</i>

Evening paper, Mr. Holmes.

Mrs. Hudson, fetch me a cab!

Mrs. Hudson. As soon as
the telegraph office is open,

to Dr. John Watson, Lake Hotel,
Fellmere, Cumberland.

But Mr. Holmes?

I shall not be here, Mrs. Hudson.

<i>Dr. Watson!</i>

I shall be on the 8:17 out of Euston.

Dr. Watson!

My cab awaits you downstairs.

Read.

Mr. Holmes...
Read!

"Grave danger Lady Frances, stop.
Never let from sight, stop."

"On my way, Holmes."

How long has this been here?

Holmes.

Disappeared, Watson.

Disappeared.

Did Lady Frances pay her bill?
No, sir.

Did she order any transport?

No, sir.

And she took none of her luggage?

We think not, sir.

Where is Mr. Holmes?

Nothing yet, Holmes.

I'm beginning to fear the worst.

I blame myself. I knew I should
have pursued that fellow.

It is a possibility.

What is?

Do you not see it?
It is most conspicuous.

The skiff, Watson,
the sailing skiff.

It's not here.
Precisely.

It is possible there lies the Lady
Frances Carfax silent road to Arranside.

It is the nearest railhead
as you know.

You don't mean that this fellow
abducted her by boat?

Silk. It is one of the three
more likely possibilities.

Best French sewn, dove gray.

She had a gray silk shawl.

No, that will tell us
nothing more.

What other three possibilities,
Holmes?

In what did she usually
wear the shawl?

Oh, her outside clothes.
The three possibilities?

She may have run away with
her intended abductor.

He may have abducted her by boat
as you suggest or by some other means.

She may, considering
her emotional condition,

have been deceived
into going with him.

I can hardly believe that. She was
terrified of him, believe me.

I believe you.

Yes.

A stray chicken in
the world of foxes.

Once she's gobbled up,
she's hardly missed.

Come, Watson.

And our horses should
be saddled by now.

Horses?

I have been somewhat extravagant
in choice of mounts,

but delay must be dangerous
in this matter.

We should be
at Rufton Hall at dusk.

I don't see what possible interest
it could have for you, sir.

Considerable interest
I assure you.

One of the most dangerous classes
in the world

is the drifting and friendless woman

with no one to
protect and guide her.

She is the inevitable inciter
of crime in others.

I treat the disappearance of
your sister with utmost seriousness.

Do you think I do not?

I'm merely suggesting that
it is frivolous

to keep from me
the substance of your quarrel.

It was after all this quarrel which
immediately preceded her disappearance.

Might it have something to do with
a drunken poet she once knew?

What?

I understand of my colleague that
she may have seen him recently.

Green?

I thought I'd seen the last of him.

I sent him packing 15 years ago.

What is his connection
with your sister?

He used to court her,
great brute of a fellow.

She wouldn't have anything
to do with him.

The Honorable Philip Green.
Never was a title so abused.

He went to the dogs completely,
drink, gambling.

Ended up destitute in Islington
pretending to write poetry.

Of course, Frances became interested
in him as soon as he lost everything.

How did you send him packing?

He was a violent fellow,
and he drank.

I'd heard talk of prosecution,
debt, assault.

I gave him 100 pounds and
bought him a ticket to Australia.

Show his face around here,
I'll set the dogs on him.

Now, your quarrel with your sister.

Money. She wanted money.

She has none of her own?

I make her an allowance
out of the estate.

It's modest, but
you've seen the place.

She has no assets herself?

Yes, she has.

I told her if she wanted money,
she could sell this.

It's a priceless collection.

That was designed for
the French royal family by Fragonard.

We acquired it all at the revolution,
and now, it's hers.

What I have is owls,
owls in the East Wing.

Want to see the owls?

Where does she keep them?
Does she travel with them?

No.

Well, now, where are they kept?

My Lord, your sister
has vanished!

How and why we do not know,

but I have reason to believe
that she is in the gravest danger.

Were we to know the
whereabouts of the jewelry,

we might have some chance
of saving her.

The Oxford and Lombard Maritime
Bank in Pall Mall.

Thank you.

The Oxford and Lombard Bank
opens its doors in 12 hours.

She may already have
come and gone.

The bank's been open
for 20 minutes.

I've been quite blind, Holmes.

I had the evidence in the palm of
my hand. If anything's happened...

Calm yourself, my dear friend.

Holmes, look!

May I help you, sir?

Yes, please, I wish to see
the manager, Sir Paulo McNeil.

It's a private matter concerning
a family deposit with the bank.

My colleague...

Watson!

You, sir.

You, sir! What have you done with
the Lady Frances Carfax?

I insist upon an answer.

Mr. Green, sir,
please excuse my friend.

He spent the last night
on the Carlisle rail express.

No, Watson, please, please.

Frances!

Frances!

I blame myself.

No, you need not.

Nevertheless, I do.

We all bear equal blame.

She's disappeared again,
and that is that.

It is pointless to dwell on it.

Our task now is to find her.

Mr. Green,

let us go back to that moment
by the lake yesterday morning.

I was out riding in the dawn

and I saw the skiff sailing across
the lake toward Arranside.

And you realized that it was
the Lady Frances?

Yes.

Was she alone?

Yes.

Please continue.

I managed to board the same train.

I begged her to speak to me.

I told her how I'd traveled the world
and had become a very rich man.

I told her that I'd
never stopped loving her,

and that she could have
whatever she wanted.

I can see her now.

She sat saying nothing,
smiling like a sphinx.

"No," she said...
She wanted to go her own way.

When we got to London,
I followed her as best I could,

but she seemed determined
to be rid of me.

I lost her somewhere
near Sellick Bridge.

Sellick?
Oh, that is most interesting.

Why?

I'm reliably informed that his usual
haunts are west of Westminster.

Who's haunts?

How did you come to
be at the bank?

I reasoned that she would be needing
money while she was in London,

and I know the address of
the family bank well enough.

I had the wild idea of
enlisting the manager's help.

Do you know where she is,
Mr. Holmes?

No, I do not.

Where do you think she is?

I believe that through
our efforts to save her,

we have driven her into
the hands of her worst enemy.

But we saw her free.

My dear Watson, a person may
walk over the edge of the cliff

because they've been
invited to gaze at the moon.

Her eyes may be open, but
she is, I believe, at this moment

walking into mortal danger.

Shlessinger?

Mr. Shlessinger.

This last week I sought
to acquaint myself

with the world of
apostolic missions.

I've also made a search of
the records of Scotland Yard.

Shlessinger

is also known as
the Reverend Joseph Cubbington,

Amos Callow, the Dean of Masaro,

and Edmund, the Bishop of Lima.

His real name, in fact, is Peters.
He's a confidence trickster,

known at Scotland Yard
by the uninspired logic

of that place as Holy Peters.

What is not yet suspected,

but incontrovertible, nonetheless, is
that he is a murderer.

Peter's specialty is the beguiling of
single women with private means

by playing on their religious and
charitable feelings.

Helena Rosenbloom had been engaged
in charitable work for ten years

when she met Shlessinger.

He inspired her to devote her energies
to a new mission in the Andes.

Miss Rosenbloom changed her will,
said good-bye to her former life,

and boarded the SS Almeria at
Glasgow bound for South America.

She was lost overboard
the first night at sea.

The SS Almeria docked
at Liverpool

for the family to retrieve
her effects.

Shlessinger also disembarked.

He went to ground at
the Lake District

where he met his next
intended victim,

the Lady Frances Carfax.

At last, gentlemen!

At last!

Where was it pawned?

Riley's of Stockwell.

It was by my calculation
the 27th shop I tried.

Riley has received two sentences
to my knowledge

for the receipt of stolen goods.
He will cooperate with us.

What does this mean?
What does it mean?

Please, Mr. Green, this is pointless.
Don't torture yourself.

Do you think the torture is
self-induced?

The thought of Frances
in the hands of criminals.

Such thoughts come unbidden,
Mr. Holmes.

They break through
the strongest defenses

the mind can raise against them.

Calm yourself, Mr. Green,
calm yourself.

If she's still innocent

of Shlessinger's true identify,
she may well be safe for a time.

And if not?

Then it is clear that he cannot let
her loose without his own destruction.

Now, we must continue to hope that
she remains ignorant of who he is.

Fifteen years.

I knew I could never come back
until I'd made something of myself.

Perhaps it was foolish
of me to think

that she would look kindly on me
after all these years, but...

I was ridiculously encouraged
by the fact that she was not married.

And now, my stupidity has driven her
into the arms of a murderer.

What can I do?

Is there nothing I can do?

Does Shlessinger know you
by sight?

No.

Ah, well, then there is something
that you can do.

But it'll demand great patience.

I have waited for 15 years,
Mr. Holmes.

Shlessinger's had a fair price for
the jewelry and no questions asked.

He'll almost certainly return
to Riley's shop.

And Rosenblooms attorney for the will.
Now, give this note to Riley.

He will let you wait at the shop.

It may be a long wait but
you must possess your soul in patience.

And above all, no violence.

It's late. Well, it should have
been here before now.

Daresay it took longer being
out of the ordinary.

The address, dear, remind me.

Yes, sir, can I help?

Argyll Street.
I'm looking for Argyll Street.

There's a post office
round the corner. Try there.

Mr. Green, we can do nothing
without a warrant.

This is intolerable.

Until we have some wretched
signature on a piece of paper,

we can do nothing.

Meanwhile these fiends can do
with her what they will.

Are you certain that
you've told me every detail?

Every detail, I promise.

Then take this note to
Scotland Yard.

They will understand
the urgency of it.

And I am to wait there
for the warrant.

You will not get it today.

Some delay is inevitable.
A magistrate must be found.

The process of the law can be
encouraged but not goaded.

Tomorrow may be too late
for God's sake.

Mr. Green, everything that can
be done will be done.

Go.

Tomorrow may indeed be too late.

I'm well aware of it.

Arm yourself, Watson.

We are as usual the irregulars
who must take our luck together

as we have occasionally
done in the past.

8:00 tomorrow morning
Brixton Cemetery.

I fancy that you've been
misdirected, sir.

Possibly it you try further
down the street.

That will do.
We have no time to waste.

You are Henry Peters,
late Major Albert Shlessinger

veteran of the Boer War.

Your further aliases I will not bore
you by repeating.

And what is your name?

Sherlock Holmes. My friend and
companion I think you know.

The house will shortly be
under police observation

until a warrant is prepared
authorizing a search of the premises.

Your name does not frighten me,
Mr. Holmes. I have nothing to hide.

What is your business?

I'm looking for
the Lady Frances Carfax.

I'm delighted to hear it.

If anyone can find her,
I imagine you can.

Perhaps you'd be so good
as to tell me when you do.

I've a note against her
for nearly 100 pounds,

and nothing to show for it
but a couple of trumpery pendants

that the dealer would
hardly look at.

The woman's a leech.

How dare you, sir.

You imposed upon us as a man
crippled in a military action.

You are a fraud.

Oh, it may not have been
a military action

to satisfy your standards
of slaughter, Doctor,

but it was enough for me.

Hm-mm. I salute your powers
of improvisation, sir,

and your effrontery,
but it will not do.

Oh, I'm perfectly serious.
You find her, and I'm your debtor.

I mean to go through this house
until I do.

You have a warrant?

This will serve until
a better one comes.

Why, you're a common burglar.

And my friend is
a dangerous ruffian.

Together we mean to
go through your house.

I'm in no position to stop you.

Search where you will.
I have nothing to hide.

Where is the coffin that you had
brought in to this house?

That is none of your business.

I repeat. Where?

Is it not enough that you force
your way into my home,

that you threaten me at gunpoint

must you also now invade
the peace of the dead?

Where?

I shall not tell you.

Hold him here, Watson.

I don't believe you'd use that
on an unarmed man, Doctor,

and in my condition.

I was a soldier in India, sir.
I've shot nobler creatures than you.

Lights, Watson! Lights!

I smelled formaldehyde
and astringent.

Thank God. It's not her.

Get them out.

You have violated the peace of
the dead. You will now leave.

Who is she?

Get them out.
Her name is Rose Spender.

Get them out!

She is my wife's old nurse.

She's been with
the family for half a century.

She died two days ago. We are to
bury her tomorrow morning.

Now, get out before
I ask the police,

you have summoned to my home
to come in and throw you out.

I've been considering
the problem, Holmes.

It does seem to me that they could
not have murdered Lady Frances

and thought to have disposed of
her body in that coffin,

for they would then be faced
with burying the old lady.

It may be that this burial
has no connection

with Lady Frances' disappearance
after all.

I mean she was, as you know,
the most-

unpredictable creature.

It may be that she had
second thoughts about Shlessinger.

She may even have had some inkling
of the kind of man we-

believe him to be and
removed herself from the house.

He was, after all,
happy to let us search it.

What do you think?

What is your theory then?

I have none.

There are insufficient facts to
construct a theory.

You think there's something
you've overlooked?

<i>It's late.</i>

<i>And, it should have been
there before now.</i>

<i>Daresay it took longer
being out of the ordinary.</i>

What has happened to any brains
that God has given me?

Watson!

Quick, man! It's life or death.

A hundred chances on death
and one on life.

Oh, God most mighty, holy,
most merciful savior,

and our most worthy
judge eternal,

suffer us not at our last hour
for any plains of death...

And never continuous in one stage.
In the midst of life, we are in death.

Of whom may we seek for succour
but of thee, oh, Lord,

who for our sins art
justly displeased.

Yet, oh, Lord, God, most holy...

For as much as it hath pleased
almighty God of his great mercy

to take unto himself the soul of
our dear sister here departed,

we therefore commit
her body to the ground.

Earth to earth

ashes to ashes

dust to dust
in sure and certain...

Stop!

Raise that coffin.

What the devil do you mean
by this sacrilege?

Murder, sir,

Murder is what I mean.

Why such a deep coffin
for such a small old lady?

A sovereign to each of you

if you can lift the lid off
that coffin in one minute.

Watson.

Stop or I'll shoot!

It's chloroform.

She's known literally
the terrors of the grave.

God knows what this will
have done to her.

I've failed.

<i>I have brought her back here
to the country of her childhood</i>

<i>which is one of the most beautiful
on this planet.</i>

<i>There has been
a great improvement as a result.</i>

<i>A landscape so familiar and
so intimate to her</i>

<i>will prompt in time
a full response I feel sure,</i>

<i>as will the company of
friends and family</i>

<i>who've all been most
kind and dutiful.</i>

<i>Her poor brother, the Earl,
is beside himself</i>

<i>with anger at the criminals</i>

<i>and with mortification at
his having quarreled</i>

<i>with Frances before
all this happened.</i>

<i>Finally, please accept the enclosed
as a token of my gratitude</i>

<i>for your saving of
my dear Frances, Mr. Holmes,</i>

<i>and I look forward to our
entertainment of you and Dr. Watson</i>

<i>in a happier future.</i>

I cannot accept it.

I refuse to be rewarded
for fostering a tragedy.

I've never suffered such a
complete eclipse of my faculties.

Well, like any eclipse, Holmes,
it's only temporary.

There's every hope of
a full recovery.

I wonder...

I wonder.

Frances?
