Arturo, son.
Hurry, I have to get going.

How many are left?
Three.

Lau, hurry, sweetie.
I'm gonna be late.

They're ready.

Dad, I've decided to go for it.

I don't think I want you to go.

Come on, Dad. I've always been
responsible. I won't let you down.

I'm not sure. I just don't like
that environment for you.

Have some faith in me, Dad.

Little man, come here.

You're gonna have to get to school
on your own today.

When you get back, lock yourself in.

Where are you going?

I'll see you tonight.

What time will you be back?

Late!

Lau! Lau!

Girl, what are you doing there?
I've been looking for you.

And what's with those rags?
Where's your dress?

Let's go. Hurry, the line is super long.

Do you know what the grand prize
will be?

What are you talking about?
What fucking prize?

For the winner!
What winner?

The pageant, girl.
Do you know what she gets?

No, what?

She has to have sex
with one of those old, rich guys.

Where do you come up with that
kind of crap? Come on, let's go.

Your entry forms?

I spoke to Luisa.
She wanted to see my friend.

Name and phone number?
Laura Guerrero.

Phone number?
638-3279.

I'm not sure you can go in.
You're very late.

No, wait. I was here earlier.
Someone's holding my place in line.

Hey, you can't cut in line.
What's your problem?

Chill, girl.
Someone's holding my place in line.

You can't cut, you bitch.

Oh, whatever, calm down.
I was already here, don't get crazy.

Stand in line like everyone else.
Calm down. Just drop it.

You can't cut!
Calm down.

Get back there...
Suzu.

Do you want in or not?
Yes.

Okay, where's your dress?

You're supposed to be wearing it.

Go get changed. Quickly.

Do you see that line on the floor?
Yes.

Walk it.

As you're walking out, smile,
tell me your name, age...

...and say, "My dream is to represent
the beautiful women of my state."

Got it?

Okay. Hurry up, sweetie.

Come on.

My name is Laura Guerrero,
I'm 23 years old...

...and my dream is to represent
the beautiful women of my state.

Don't laugh.

Let me see your nails.

Oh, you have to fix them.
They look like my maid's nails.

Fine, you're in.

I want to see you both tomorrow, very early.
Seven o'clock a.m., ready to rehearse.

You got it. Thanks.

Thanks.

For those of us who are fair-skinned.
Oh, be quiet, blondie.

Look at this dress, it's great.

I just saw this other one, it's prettier.

What do you think?
Wait.

Lau.
Hold on, I wanna watch this.

Why do you care what that girl does?
Pay attention. Lau.

You're going to like this one. Lau.

Fucking Javi is here.

I've gotta go.
What's that guy doing here?

He wants to go to the Millennium Club.
Thought we were going shopping.

What do you want me to do?
Tell him you'll see him later.

Girl.

Fine. Wait for me here.

Let me go tell him.

What's up, babe?

What the hell are you doing here?
Come on, let's go.

I'll pay you later.

I'm with Suzu, I think she's with Javi.

Go ahead.

Let her through. She's with Javi.

Suzu, what happened?
Why did you leave?

I've been looking for you.

Get over here.

Hey, hey! Don't touch her
like that, asshole!

What the fuck is wrong with you?

Let me go.

Okay, asshole, stop!

She's leaving, I'll take her out.

Don't come back.
She needs a fucking shower.

I'm sorry, Lau.

Lau, these guys have connections.
They can help us win the contest.

What kind of connections
are these assholes going to have?

Lau.

If you want me to,
I'll tell Javi we're leaving.

And we can go somewhere else.

Let's go. I'll meet you out front.

Wait for me at the door.

Let's move.

Do you recognize me?

Pick it up.

How many people are out there?

I don't know.

Okay, get out of here.

Keep your mouth shut.

<i>We're ready.</i>
<i>Everybody take their positions.</i>

Stay calm.

Nothing's going on here.

<i>No mercy, boss. No mercy.</i>

Suzu, let's get out of here!

Everybody on the floor!

Suzu!

On the floor!
Suzu!

Get him! Get him! Don't move!

Get those pigs! Get them!

Come on, come on, hurry!

Get the job done! Hurry, hurry!

Find the American!

Gather the bodies.
Come on! Put them together.

<i>- The cops are on their way.</i>
Okay, boss, ready.

Ventura, bring the truck, hurry!

Parca, bring the other trucks out back.

Come on, come on, let's go.
Time's up!

The pigs are on their way.

Hurry, let's go. We're out of time!

<i>We're done. Over. Let's go.</i>

Hop on, hurry!

They're getting closer, move it!

Leave the rest of the bodies, let's go!

Fucking hurry! They're here, let's go!

Let's go!

Officer, my friend's inside!
Please let me in!

There's nobody inside. You have to go!

Ma'am.

Have you heard anything?

Me either.

Yes, I'll let you know.

Thanks.

What do you mean,
she didn't make it?

You're out. We're rehearsing.
We looked everywhere.

We got into some trouble.

I don't know what else to say, you're out.
It's not fair.

Look, sweetie, nothing's fair.

Take this as a lesson. You have to
be more responsible. Goodbye.

I'm sorry, Luisa.

Give me another chance.

Let me find her
and we'll come back, please.

Just leave.

Okay, ready, girls? From the top.

I need your help.
What's going on?

I can't find my friend.

Where did you leave her?
We were at the Millennium nightclub.

When? Last night?
Yes.

I do transit only. I can't help you.
Go to the police station.

No, wait, can you please
try to find her using your radio?

Name?
Mine?

No, your friend's name.
Azucena Ramos.

No, you have to go to the police station.

Come on, help me. Please.

Fine. Get in, quickly.

Tell me what happened.

We were just hanging out...

...and these people came.

And then?
They had guns...

...and they started shooting.

I think they took some people
in plastic bags.

Wait a sec.
I was scared.

Okay, give me a sec.

R-12, do you copy? R-12.

<i>- Copy.</i>
I have a 38 on my hands.

She claims she was at yesterday's
incident, at the Millennium.

<i>I'll get right back to you.</i>
<i>Let me check with R-1.</i>

Yes, please. Check on it
and call me back. Thanks.

What were you doing there?

Wait.

Hello.

Yes.

Yes.

Correct.

I'm on my way.

Where are we going?

We're going just up ahead to the station.
They'll take down your statement.

I want you to testify
about everything you saw and heard.

What else did you see or hear?

It was very dark.

What's your name?

Laura.

Laura what?

Laura Guerrero.

Don't worry, Laura.

Wait right here.

I'll be back.

Don't move, I'm grabbing my lunch.

What are you looking for?

I'm looking for my friend.

What friend?

She was with me at the Millennium.
Check her out, make sure she's clean.

Sir, wait, what's going on?

Boss, that skinny chick
from the Millennium is here.

No.

Get over here. Get out.

Sir, please, wait.
Open the door.

No!

Get her inside!
Let me go!

Get her inside!

No!

Linito, we're on our way.

Who sent you?
Nobody, I came here on my own.

<i>What does she want?</i>

What the fuck are you looking for?
Sorry, I made a mistake.

Let me go.
<i>- She's clean, boss.</i>

I swear I won't say a word.

<i>- Sure it's the girl from yesterday?</i>
Yeah, from the bathroom.

She came with To√±ito,
looking for her friend.

What the fuck are you looking for?
<i>- Go ahead. You know what to do.</i>

I'm sorry, sir.
I made a mistake, please let me go.

If I catch you lying,
I'll beat the shit out of you.

What's your name?

Laura Guerrero, sir.

Where do you live?

915 Angela Peralta.

Phone number?

638-3279.

Who do you live with?

With my dad and my brother.

What do you do for a living?

We sell clothes.

What were you looking for?

I went looking for my friend Suzu after
fighting with the people from the pageant.

What pageant?

Miss Baja.

Okay, Canelita.

Listen, Canelita.

Stay calm.

Okay, Canelita. I'm gonna help you.

But I need you to do something for me.

What do you say?

Do you know how to drive?

Well?

Cali.

Gather the crew.

<i>Okay, they're on their way.</i>

Hide.

Canelita, here are the keys.

Stay down for a bit.
I'll be waiting for you outside, okay?

<i>Let's go. Hurry, hurry.</i>

Follow us, park where I tell you
and wait for us on the other side.

Hey, lady, get out of here.

Get her in, get her in!

Block the street!
Don't let anybody through. Get her inside.

Cali, stand watch!
Let's go! Don't let anybody else through.

Nobody else goes through!

Let's go, hurry!

<i>Clear out! Clear out! Let's move.</i>

Come and get it, pigs.

<i>Lino, we're clearing out.</i>
<i>Go down the main boulevard...</i>

You smoked them, Canelita.

Hey, man, see who's in charge
of that beauty queen thing.

We're gonna help her get in.

How does that sound, Canelita?

Come on, smile.

<i>The pigs are on Juarez Street.</i>

<i>Keep your eyes open, stand guard.</i>

They're goners, they left.

<i>Keep going, we're clear.</i>

What does a miss do,
aside from sitting on her ass all day?

She makes money.

What if I do get you in?

<i>Those on the right are with us,</i>
<i>they'll let you through.</i>

Any news on my friend?

Okay, we're going straight.

I'm working on it. Give me time.

<i>Keep going straight,</i>
<i>cross Defensores.</i>

<i>You got it. We're headed that way.</i>

<i>Through Anzures, do you copy?</i>

<i>Copy. We got a green light.</i>
<i>Let's move, let's go.</i>

<i>Keep going straight. It's clear.</i>

<i>Those on Serdan Street are with us.</i>

<i>I'll let you know when we move again.</i>

<i>We're staying here for now.</i>

Laura, we made a mistake.

I've signed you up. Here's your number.

And Suzu?

We're waiting for her.

I need you to fill in some info.

You're in, Canelita.

In a little while,
they'll bring your friend to you.

Buy yourself the nicest dress
you can find.

Parca here will drive you.
And later, you go to the hideout.

No, thanks.

I'm not asking you.

She was on the phone with someone.

Give me your phone.

Who did you call?

I sent a message to my friend.

I told you I was taking care of that.

I don't want you using your phone.

Give me another one.

How long has it been
since we used this one?

This one is old, it's clean.

I want you to take her to buy a dress.
Then take her to the hideout.

<i>You got it, boss.</i>

I'll call you later.

Okay?

Is there another exit?
Where are you going?

Sorry. Thanks.

Can I help you with something?

Hello.

I'm looking for a dress.

What's the occasion?

For a beauty pageant.

In our store, all of the dresses
are custom-made.

You won't find anything
under $1000.

Yeah, I have the money.

Here is the green one you liked.

Thanks.
Let me know if you need anything else.

Yes?

<i>Canelita, where are you?</i>

Here.

<i>Here, where?</i>

Everything okay? Do you need help?

I'm sorry.

I don't have anything!

I didn't do anything!

Go home.

Where were you?

Where's Dad?
In his room.

Where did you sleep?

With Suzu. Be quiet.

Cover for me?
Yes.

Open up.

What's going on?

What's wrong, Lau?

Nothing.

Are you okay?

Yes.

Why did you go away?

<i>Also, during the operation...</i>

<i>... two members of the criminal group</i>
<i>La Estrella were captured.</i>

Can you bring me something to eat?
Yes.

<i>- Alias Lino, was able to escape,</i>
<i>his whereabouts...</i>

Little man, don't make noise.

<i>This is yet another run-in between</i>
<i>the police and this criminal group...</i>

<i>... that started after they were identified</i>
<i>as being responsible for leaving a vehicle...</i>

<i>... in front of the embassy</i>
<i>containing the bodies of an agent...</i>

<i>... a federal police officer</i>
<i>and a young woman, not yet identified.</i>

<i>It has been General Salom√≥n Duarte's</i>
<i>primary agenda...</i>

<i>... after being named</i>
<i>chief of police for the state...</i>

<i>... to combat the various criminal groups that</i>
<i>are taking over the state of Baja California.</i>

<i>Lino is thought to be one of</i>
<i>the most active criminals in this state.</i>

<i>He is suspected of being responsible for</i>
<i>a recent attack in the Millennium nightclub...</i>

<i>... where the lives of</i>
<i>12 officers and civilians were lost.</i>

Did you go to school?

No.

Why not?
He didn't take me.

What have you been doing?

Nothing.

What's that?

It's all I could find.

Thanks.

What happened to you?

I fell down.

Ouch, it hurts!

Don't laugh.

Arturo, get dressed.

Open the door, fucker!

Step back.

Step back, motherfucker.
Take anything you want.

Where is Laura, motherfucker?
Who is Laura?

Do you want to die?

Dad.

I'm gonna fucking kill you.
I know she's here.

You son of a bitch, where is she?

There's no one here, man.

Dad.

Go to your room.

Go on!

Turn off all the lights.

Nobody goes near the windows.

Wait, please.

Come on!

Arturo!

Arturo!

Come with me.

Don't look back, okay?

Stay in here.

Everything is going to be okay.

Goddamn it.

Why the fuck did you run away?

Do you see what happened?
Fucking shit.

Who the fuck took your phone?

I don't know.

Go to your room.

How many of them were there?

Like six or seven.

What kind of trucks did they have?

Black ones.

What did they do to you?

They hit me and took the phone.

What else?
Nothing.

Move over.

Cover that lamp.

<i>- Linito, where you at?</i>
Copy.

<i>They took all our ammo.</i>

<i>They also got Ventura.</i>

<i>We had to run.</i>
<i>They took over our hideout.</i>

Who the fuck did you go see?

Nobody.

Then why the fuck did you run away?

Roquita. I'm in the clear.

<i>Everything is calm on this side.</i>

Got it.

Cut the radios and start calling the U.S.

<i>All right, boss. We're fearless.</i>

I need you to run an errand for me.

Did you hear me?

Anything you want.

Just let my brother go.

You've got a deal.

We're in the clear.

<i>Jimmy, Jimmy.</i>

We want three boxes.

Ram√≥n, open up.

I've packed up some things for you.

Don't say anything.

If something happens,
I'm going to pay for it.

Wait, you go.
Tell them I'll stay in your place.

We can't do that.

Take this.

Don't be afraid, little man.

I love you.

Go on, leave.

Linito, the man and the kid are escaping.

Let them go.

The boss says they can leave.

Shut the fucking door!

Lino wants you in your room.

<i>General Duarte, in today's</i>
<i>press conference...</i>

<i>... gave a full report on the attack</i>
<i>against the criminal group La Estrella.</i>

<i>Something that can</i>
<i>only be classified as a lucky hit.</i>

<i>We've captured most members</i>
<i>of the criminal group.</i>

<i>We've taken most of</i>
<i>their weapons and ammo...</i>

<i>... and we expect to have all of them</i>
<i>captured before the weekend is over.</i>

Shut the door.

Take off your robe.

Put some clothes on.

<i>They've tapped our radios.</i>

I'm shutting down.

Give me a holler when we are ready.
<i>- You got it.</i>

T√≠o. Keep an eye on Chiquirris.

I think he might be a rat.

<i>You got it, boss.</i>

That's enough.

Turn off the light.

Come here.

Lay down here.

Don't move.

Be still.

Hands up.

Put these on.

T√≠o. We're ready.

Call Jimmy,
we'll need three cases of bullets.

Canelita. You're gonna
bring back a truck.

When you cross the border,
go under the bridge.

I'll be waiting for you there.

Take a good look at these monkeys.
Tell me who took your phone.

This one.

T√≠o, we know who did it. Call the taxi.

<i>The gringo is waiting for her.</i>

Okay, we're here.

If they catch you with the money,
tell them you don't know me.

I have a family to feed.

Where are you heading?
To San Diego.

Who sent you?
Nobody.

What's the purpose of your visit?
I'm going shopping.

I need your passport.

Laura Guerrero, LG08714678.

<i>- She's clear, let her through.</i>
Let her through.

Let her through, move the truck.

The chick got through.

Your passport.

Laura Guerrero, LG0871...

<i>She's clean, let her through.</i>

Understand?
Yes.

Stop, stop!

Hurry, they're hitting us hard!

Go get Canelita!

Get down!
Go get Canelita and the ammo!

Get down, get down!

Get her out, get her out!

Get the girl inside, cover her!

Let's get out of here!

Go, go, go!

Hop on!

What did the gringo tell you?

Kike Camara is in Tijuana.

What else?

He's under the name of Orlando Gomez.

That's it?
Nothing else.

<i>That gringo motherfucker.</i>

Okay, let's go.

Get down, get down.

Get in.

We're almost there.

<i>Linito, they said it was the general</i>
<i>who screwed us over.</i>

Okay, Pollo.

Sniff this, Canelita.

There's been a change
in the order of the girls.

Here she is, Laura Guerrero.

She goes on right after Jessica.

There's a change in the swimsuit lineup.

Listen to me, goddamn it.
Frank, get her ready.

Right now!

Jessica, it's time.

Just leave it, come on.

Coming up next,
our beautiful candidates will participate...

...in the swimsuit portion
of the competition.

From Mexicali, she studies botany.

She dreams of traveling the world
while helping to save the planet.

A round of applause
for Miss Jessica Verduzco.

Ambassador of this great city.
She studies pedagogy.

Her dream is to help her brother
earn a college degree.

A round of applause for Laura Guerrero.

Good evening. Baja California is one of
the most beautiful states in this country.

But oftentimes, it's only known
for its defects.

I believe that with education,
tolerance and respect...

...we can show everybody
that this is a place full of light.

Absolutely, this place is full of light.

Let's hear it for Jessica Verduzco.
Thank you very much.

A stunning young lady.
Her presence lights up the stage...

...the Miss Baja California stage.

And now, Laura Guerrero.

A 23-year-old from Tijuana.

And here she comes, Laura Guerrero.

How are you this evening?

Fine, thank you.

Laura, tell me, what do you
desire most, wealth or fame?

I believe that...

I'm sorry.

Overcome by emotion. She fills the stage
with her sensitivity, Laura Guerrero.

She enhances this stage with her beauty.

A big round of applause
for Laura Guerrero, please...

...who leaves us filled with emotion.

And our pageant continues...

Arturo.

Are you okay?

Where are you?

Okay, girls, gather together.

Don't go to the house, okay?
It's prayer time, come.

No, I'm fine.

Yes.

The time has come.

I'll call you later.

Later.
Think about it.

Take care.

How many bridges
you had to cross to get here.

You have the external beauty.
Now take a look inside...

...and surprise yourself.

Seize every moment.

As you know, this is the most
beautiful day of your life.

What's our motto?

Viva Miss Baja California!

Let's go. Let's go.

<i>Coming up, we will announce</i>
<i>the winner of Miss Baja California.</i>

Miranda Cortina,
from Ensenada, Baja California.

A big round of applause for Miranda...

...who at this moment is receiving
a beautiful bouquet of flowers.

Now, one of these two beauties before us
will be the new Miss Baja California.

Please listen carefully.

I'm going to say the name of the
Miss Baja California runner-up.

And the second-place winner is...

...Jessica Verduzco from Mexicali,
Baja California.

A big round of applause for her.

That makes this beautiful young lady...

...Laura Guerrero from Tijuana,
Baja California, our new beauty queen.

And now she's going to be crowned
by the former Miss Baja California queen.

A big round of applause for her.

She's now receiving her
official beauty queen sash.

Those are the drums of our band La Furia,
who delight us with their music.

Our new beauty queen, Laura Guerrero...

...is being presented with the most beautiful
bouquet of flowers by this young man.

And let's hear that round
of applause for all of our...

...Miss Baja California contestants.

Laura Guerrero...

...our new beauty queen,
Miss Baja California!

Let's hear that applause.
Let's hear it for her one more time.

Laura, you meet the press
in 10 minutes. Laura?

Why did you run away?
Didn't you want to be a queen?

Yeah, but not like that.

Well, that's the luck of the draw.
If you wanna leave, then get the hell out.

But you can't come back here again.
You can't go to your house...

...or talk to anybody you know.

Take this money.

Walk straight for a couple of hours
and you'll hit something.

Go.

Take off your clothes.

Time for your interview, man.

Name?

Kike Camara.

Name.

Enrique Camara.

Who do you work for?

For the DEA.

Here in Mexico,
who do you operate with?

What do you have to say to those
motherfuckers that work with you?

They know what they have to do.

Why do you come here
to fuck everything up?

You should've stayed in
your country, motherfucker.

Did you find something?
Nothing.

Keep going.
Just police reports, from the gringos.

Wear this.

Tie it off!

Who's in to go to the hotel?

I don't think so, it's too dangerous.

Come on, Lino. It's too risky.

We'll be in and out.

I don't know, boss.

You monkeys.

Where's the crown?

Get in the truck.

Check the gear,
I want every gun working.

Okay, fuckers. Who's in?

Forty grand for each one of you
for this one.

Come on, guys, we're fearless.

Come on. Get in.

Get in.

<i>It's crawling with cops,</i>
<i>we have to go around.</i>

<i>Okay, you know what to do.</i>

<i>I'm here, partner. Talk to me.</i>

<i>I'm sending you three cars for backup.</i>

<i>We're on our way.</i>

<i>How's it looking?</i>

We're on our way.
How's it looking, Pollo?

<i>He's here with his men.</i>

How many are there?

<i>There are lots of pigs</i>
<i>and about eight trucks.</i>

Okay.

You're going to have breakfast with the
general. They're going to introduce him...

...to you. You're gonna flirt with him.

Later, he'll ask you to go to his room.

Or he'll invite you somewhere else.

What if he doesn't invite me?

Just flirt with him
and forget about the rest.

You know what we need.

We want to know
when you're alone with him.

Take this. We'll call you when you're inside.
Don't hang up.

Stay on the line.

Come on, get out. Hurry, hurry.

What's the purpose of your visit?

My name is Laura Guerrero.
I'm here for the Miss Baja event.

Hello, welcome. They're waiting for you.
Hello.

Where's the crown?
Thank you.

Where were you?

Why did you disappear? Smile.

Don Salom√≥n.

General, how are you?

Luisa, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
Laura, come.

I want you to meet Laura,
the new Miss Baja California.

She was crowned yesterday.

Freshly crowned, and I must say
she has a nice appearance.

I'm at your service, general.

Take a seat, have a drink with us.

Thank you, very kind of you,
but I have to return to my table.

She's a hottie, general.

Look, you made the front page.
You look good in the picture.

What time is the interview?

Four o'clock p.m., but we have to
arrive earlier for makeup.

Miss, from the general.
Thank you.

Beauty Queen Overnight

I'm going to give you this phone.
Carry it at all times.

You can't disappear
like you did yesterday.

You caused a lot of problems
with the interviews.

And you have to smile more often.

What are the secretaries
from the mayor's office doing here?

Excuse me.

Bodies left at the
Embassy identified

Yes.

Yes.

I'm Laura Guerrero.
I'm here to see General Duarte.

I have a Laura Guerrero
here to see the general.

<i>Let her through.</i>

Go ahead.

Please.

Look, it's that blind guy.
What blind guy?

The one that sings.

Sir, Miss Laura is here.

All right.

Come in, please.

You have to get it together.

What's important is that you send me
some men that can stay with me.

Make yourself a drink.
Start getting undressed.

That incident with the gringo
has caused me serious problems.

I have to issue a report very soon.

They're gonna kill you.

They're going to kill you.
They're listening to us.

Oh, yeah, baby, that's it.

Open your legs.

Stay calm.

Go, go, go.

Close off the area. Let's go, let's go.

Make sure there's no one left
in the rooms.

They're all yours. We're all set.

She's under the bed, get her out.

Bring the girl over here.

Fuck her up!

Ready?

Sir, can I please make a phone call?
Sorry, babe, we're about to start.

Let's go.

Keep your head up, babe.

The spokesperson for the attorney general
will give us a detailed report...

...of yesterday's operation.

In a joint effort...

...federal, state and local police...

...fought and defeated
the criminal group known as La Estrella.

In this operation, the lives
of Captain Agustin Robles...

...and eight state policemen were lost...

...along with those of eight criminals.

Among them, the leader of the group,
Chalino Valdez, a.k.a. Lino...

...and one of his personal bodyguards
Lorenzo San Martin, a.k.a. T√≠o.

Also captured during the operation...

...Laura Guerrero,
formerly Miss Baja California...

...allegedly responsible for parking
the vehicle at the embassy...

...containing the bodies of Commander
Fernandez, Agent Raymond Bell...

...as well as Azucena Ramos, civilian.

I'm sorry.

Forgive me.

<i>The stunning young lady on your screen,</i>
<i>who was crowned Miss Baja California...</i>

<i>... has just been arrested.</i>

<i>Her name is Laura Guerrero,</i>
<i>she's from Tijuana, Baja California.</i>

<i>They found her in possession of weapons,</i>
<i>over 1000 cartons of ammo...</i>

<i>... and approximately $100,000.</i>

<i>The young lady is being linked</i>
<i>to the criminal group La Estrella...</i>

<i>... who were captured during</i>
<i>an operation by federal and state police...</i>

<i>... where there was an attempt</i>
<i>against General Salom√≥n Duarte.</i>

<i>She was the only woman captured</i>
<i>amongst the powerful criminal group.</i>

<i>I repeat, her name is Laura Guerrero.</i>

<i>On the phone with us is Luisa Janes,</i>
<i>pageant coordinator.</i>

<i>Thank you for letting me</i>
<i>voice my opinion.</i>

<i>This is definitely a very delicate subject</i>
<i>and a real shame.</i>

<i>The actions of girls like her</i>
<i>are a real embarrassment to Mexico.</i>

<i>The Miss Baja California pageant</i>
<i>condemns these actions.</i>

What's going on?

What's going on?

Let me go!
