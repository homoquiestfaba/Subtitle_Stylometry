I have a lot to think through

Your mother led such a good life

Her passing should be celebrated
not mourned

Ma did so much

But, what have I achieved?

You're taking this photo with you

This one's my favorite

Nashaad, you have many more

Neither you'll be here nor the photo,
how will I survive?

Leela, please don't go

Don't say like that Nashaad, I'm
not going forever

Will you write?

Everyday.. and you?

I'll write one song for you. Everyday.

It seems from your letters that..

America is suiting you

But your suitors here are wilting.

Hamid can't wait for you to come back.

Yesterday Kali Prasad had come...

And he moped around for
an hour today

Your admirers are
suffering here Leela.

With your favorite poet
being the foremost

I live in the fragrant Spring

....inebriated by your absence
wrapped up in your thoughts

Dearest, it's been three weeks
since I've seen you

But it feels like three years

You were right Nashaad.

I've already found a 'fan' here

You won't believe what happened today...

In search of my sweetheart
I hold my breath

Every living moment
ls a moment of death for me

I live wrapped up in your thoughts

Nashaad, I wish you were here

I got another invitation
to perform in America

How do I gently refuse?

I've heard they ask poet to
sing films songs! Oh God!

You promised to write everyday

I haven't heard from you in a week

Is everything alright?

Is there something you want to tell me?

Is Nashaad there?

Who's calling?

Get Nashaad on the line

Just a moment

Nashaad who was that woman

Leela, sweetheart

I want to know who that woman was

Leela, my sweet heart

I cannot believe that you could

...bring another woman to our bed!

Leela, listen to me

I don't want to listen to anything

Leela, I don't know how
I've survived the last few months

Without seeing your face...
smelling your hair

Without breathing the same air
that you breathe

There is so much I want to tell you

I've written a whole book of poems for you

Sitting on our balcony

Inspired by the vast ocean

I wrote a song for you everyday

But now, I only want to look at you

How have you been Leela?

You haven't even mentioned
your "boyfriend"!

You wrote so much about him
I feel like I know him.

You know why I came, don't you?

I don't know what happened to you
that night

I was scared, Leela

I can never cause you any pain

Sweetheart

Nashaadsahab, please sing for us

Please don't insist, Naheed

You can't do this to your fans

Won't you heed this small request?

Singing is not my profession
It is my passion

I'm honored that you like what I write

But, please don't ask me to sing here

I don't think I've had the pleasure

You flatter me Mrs. Chatterjee

Come...Thanks

Joya is giving me an invaluable lesson
in expatriate morality

All my music, my poetry, my art
ls for Leela

Then please sing for us

You really want me to sing?

Alright I will

Jai, Nashaad has finally agreed to sing

We can do it here

What would you need?

A tanpura, a tabla..and...

Kris plays the guitar extremely well

Krishna, will you play with me?

How long will you make me wait?
Come to bed

I still have work to do

Can't it wait?

I'll join you soon

So said the moon to the night...

But when the moon was ready

Night had already turned to day

The moon had lost it's luster...

That's enough, Nashaad

Leela, I've noticed a change in you

Because I don't agree with
everything you say?

No, you are an independent woman..

Independent?

All these years you've twisted me
around your fingers

But the day you brought
a whore to our bed

Leela, please.. that woman was Simran

And you were too angry to notice

Simran? Your niece?

Yes. What hurt the most was that

...you'd believe I could do such a thing

You are my life

I need some time..

By myself..

Away from you

What are you saying?

You are the light of my whole being

And you want to leave me in the dark?

I love you and I know you love me more

This is not about you...

It's about me

I promise I'll never stray again

But please don't abandon me

Whole night I kept awake & sang

Dewdrops in the eyes

Whole night I kept awake and sang

Love like this cannot be extinguished

Like a torrent that cannot be dammed

Eyes filled to the brim

Whole night I kept awake & sang

Ties of the soul are eternal

Scars on the heart are indelible

The night was split
tossing and turning

Whole night I kept
awake and sang

Dewdrops in the eyes

Whole night I kept awake and sang

I'm a "Pathan" by birth but
I grew up in Delhi

Well done my boy - Thank you
