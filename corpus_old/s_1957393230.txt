â™ª If you do want me,
give me little sugar â™ª

â™ª If you don't want me,
don't lead me on, girl â™ª

â™ª But if you need me,
show me that you love me â™ª

â™ª And when I'm feeling blue,
and I want you â™ª

â™ª There's just one thing
that you should do â™ª

â™ª Just gimme
some kinda sign, girl â™ª

â™ª Oh, my baby

â™ª To show me
that you're mine, girl â™ª

â™ª All right

â™ª Just gimme
some kinda sign, girl â™ª

â™ª Oh, my darlin'

â™ª To show me
that you're mine, girl â™ª

â™ª All right

â™ª If you do want me,
give me little sweet talk â™ª

â™ª And if you don't want me,
don't lead me on, girl â™ª

â™ª But if you need me,
show me that you love me â™ª

â™ª And when I'm feeling down,
wearin' a frown â™ª

â™ª You'll be there
when I look around â™ª

â™ª Just gimme
some kinda sign, girl â™ª

â™ª Oh, my baby

â™ª To show me
that you're mine, girl â™ª

â™ª All right

â™ª Just gimme
some kinda sign, girl â™ª

â™ª Oh, my darlin'

â™ª To show me
that you're mine, girl â™ª

â™ª All right

Yeah.

Hey, hey, kids, look there!

My name is Abraham Jacob Lee

and I am my father's son.

My father, Hubert Lee,
served in Korea.

( babies crying )

One day he found a baby
in a ditch.

But the baby died

before he could deliver it
to the orphanage.

( babies crying )

( baby cries )

Well, you look happy.

What do you know
that all the others don't?

ABRAHAM:
The moment he saw
my Korean name

I became his son.

Abraham Jacob Lee.

( baby cries )

So who's that?

Is she afraid I'll take you
and not her?

( baby cries )

I think I know you.

I think you are none other
than Louise Janine Lee.

Abraham Jacob Lee?

Yes, Dad?

Who's your
favorite father?
You are.

Who's your
only father?

You are.

Janine Louise Lee?

Who's your
favorite father?

Daddy, must we?

Who's your favorite
father, Louise?

( "Runaway" plays on radio )

â™ª I wonder...

â™ª I wah wah wah wah wonder

â™ª Why...

â™ª Why, why, why, why, why

â™ª She ran away

â™ª And I wonder...

â™ª Where she will stay

â™ª My little runaway

â™ª Run, run, run, run, runaway

â™ª Run, run, run, run, runaway

â™ª Run, run, run, run,
runaway... â™ª

( waves crashing )

Right here.

( Hubert laughs )

ABRAHAM:
This, I knew immediately,
was our journey's end.

A stretch of sand

halfway between Jacksonville
and Saint Augustine.

HUBERT:
This is going to be
just right, don't you think?

ABRAHAM:
Here my father would build
his great wall of life

and it would be exactly
as he saw it in his mind...

big as a dream.

HUBERT:
What's that?

ABRAHAM:
My father studied literature
in college

and to him the world was full
of signs and symbols.

Everything had a meaning.

From the moment my father
first laid eyes on him

Turner Knight
was Death personified.

And since my father
saw himself as life

it was inevitable
that they would be
adversaries.

Bye.

ABRAHAM:
Perhaps other things
were inevitable, too

etched in stone long
before any of us were born.

HUBERT:
Look at him, kids.

He has no idea

what the future has
in store for him...

that Hubert T. Lee and
his great wall of life

are going to put him
in the dark.

Abraham, Louise

your father is
a dramatic man.

Pay him no mind.

Come on.

( mid-tempo rhythm and blues
tune playing )

â™ª Oogum, oogum, boogum, boogum

â™ª Boogum, now, baby

â™ª You're casting your spell
on me â™ª

HUBERT:
All right now

here we go,
here we go.

â™ª I say

â™ª Oogum, oogum, boogum, boogum

â™ª Boogum, now, baby

â™ª You're casting your spell
on me â™ª

â™ª You got me doin' funny things
like a clown â™ª

â™ª Just look at me

ABRAHAM:
My father thought that once
The Flamingo was built

Turner Knight would be forced
to relocate.

Life would send Death packing.

â™ª And you wear
that cute miniskirt â™ª

â™ª With your brother's
sloppy shirt â™ª

ABRAHAM:
He was wrong.

I'm glad your mother
didn't live to see this.

MAN:
Come inside, Dad.

â™ª Boogum, now, baby

â™ª You're casting your spell
on me â™ª

â™ª I say

â™ª Oogum, oogum, boogum, boogum

â™ª Boogum, now, baby

â™ª You're casting your spell
on me â™ª

â™ª You got me doin' funny things
like a clown â™ª

â™ª Just look at me

â™ª When you wear
your high-heel boots â™ª

â™ª With your hip-hugger suit

â™ª Huh! It's all right

â™ª You're outta sight

â™ª And you wear
that cute miniskirt â™ª

â™ª With your brother's
sloppy shirt â™ª

â™ª Huh! I admit it

â™ª Girl, that I can dig it

â™ª And I say

â™ª Oogum, oogum, boogum, boogum

â™ª Boogum, now, baby

â™ª You're casting your spell
on me â™ª

â™ª I say

â™ª Oogum, oogum, boogum, boogum

â™ª Boogum, now, baby

â™ª You're casting your spell
on me â™ª

â™ª You got me doing funny things
like a clown â™ª

â™ª Just look at me

â™ª When you wear
your bell-bottom pants â™ª

â™ª I just stand there
in a trance â™ª

â™ª Huh! I can't move

â™ª You're in the groove

â™ª Would you believe,
little girl â™ª

â™ª That I am crazy 'bout you?

â™ª Huh!

â™ª Now, go on now
with your bad self... â™ª

( truck horn blares )

â™ª Ooh, ooh...

Uh-oh.

What?

Death's paying
life a visit.

â™ª Ooh, ooh...

â™ª Ooh, now, mercy,
mercy on me... â™ª

ABRAHAM:
During the year
we built the Flamingo

we didn't formally introduce
ourselves to Turner Knight.

He and my father communicated
only through lawyers.

â™ª You got style, girl,
that shore is wild â™ª

â™ª And wear
that cute trench coat â™ª

â™ª And you're standing
and posing â™ª

â™ª You got soul

â™ª You got too much soul

â™ª And I say

â™ª Oogum, oogum, boogum...

KNIGHT::
I beg you to be
reasonable, Mr. Lee.

I'm trying to conduct
a funeral service.

HUBERT:
I thought we agreed

that you were
going to stay

on your side
of the highway

and I was going
to stay on mine.

That's just the point,
Mr. Lee.

Your music
is on my side

of the highway.

HUBERT:
Well, what manner of man

objects to music?

KNIGHT:
I don't object

to music, Mr. Lee,
but I am well aware

you're trying to ruin
my business to drive me out.

â™ª When you wear
your bell-bottom pants... â™ª

I'm trying to conduct
a funeral service

for the 17-year-old daughter

of the mayor
of Saint Augustine!

How would you like to kneel

in my chapel

beside the casket
of your daughter

and be forced to listen
to "Oogum Boogum"?

( record scratches )

I will never kneel
in your chapel, Mr. Knight.

On this you may
rely implicitly.

EDNA:
Mr. Knight...

Mr. Knight.

( panting )

Mr. Knight...

I fear we have been
very inconsiderate.

Mrs. Lee, believe me

I harbor no ill feeling
for you or your...

Husband.

...family.

Surely, we could come

to some reasonable
accommodation.

Of course, perhaps
you could telephone

our office when you're
having a service.

Thank you, Mrs. Lee.

And we will be installing
individual speaker posts

as soon as possible.

According to whom?

According to me, Hubert.

If you'll excuse me.

Gladly, you're excused.

Hubert, Hubert!

Hubert,
you're a good, decent man.

Act like one.

Oh, Hubert.

What gets into you?

Abraham?

Yes, Dad?

Later on, when you grow up

and find yourself
a good woman...

run like crazy.

Yes, Dad.

â™ª Let me in, whee-ooh

â™ª Whee-ooh, whee-ooh â™ª

â™ª Hoop-whee-ooh â™ª

â™ª Whee-ooh, whee-ooh â™ª

â™ª Hoop-whee-ooh â™ª

â™ª I can see them dancin'

â™ª The silhouettes on the shade

â™ª I hear the music

â™ª All the lovers on parade

â™ª Open up

â™ª I want to come in again

( horn blares )

â™ª I thought you were my friend

â™ª Pitter-patter of those feet

â™ª Movin' and a-groovin'
with that beat â™ª

â™ª Jumpin' and stompin'
on the floor â™ª

â™ª Let me in!

â™ª Open up!

Oh, oh, my, yes!

You know what this place
is going to be?

ALL:
A gold mine!

That is right.

We ran out of everything.

I'm guessing about 50 or 60 kids
snuck in in car trunks.

Maybe more.

They're sneaking
in the exit, too.

We should hire
someone to guard it.

Mm-hmm.
EDNA:
Hubert, listen.

Louise is right.

We're seriously understaffed
on weekends.

We need two registers going
Fridays and Saturdays.

Popcorn is where
we make our money.

Yeah, Daddy,
you're going to have

to adopt at least
two more kids.

( giggles )

Ooh!

I know what we really need.

Pirate costumes!

Daddy.
( groans )

Yes.

Pirate...

Yeah.

Pirate costumes.

Oh, yes.

( laughs )

Ten, 20...

Come on, Abraham.

Oh, yes... here, hold these.

You got that?

Here.

Huh?

( laughing )

Ha!

You like it?

Yeah.

Ha!

My goodness!

( tires squealing )

Stand back, stand back!

My goodness, are you...?

Come on out of there.

Are you... are you all right?

Yeah.

Now, really,
are you all right?
Yeah.

Are you sure
you're all right, Mr...?

Maws, Pete Maws.

Really?

Yeah.

Hubert T. Lee.

Edna Lee, Abraham Lee,
Louise Janine Lee.

How do you do?

Pleased to meet you.

I'm sorry about
the fence, Mr. Lee.

Not at all, not at all,
don't you worry about that.

That's not important.

This, this your drive-in?

It's not just a
drive-in, Mr. Maws.

You're looking at
the world's largest
movie screen...

conceived, built, and operated
by the Hubert T. Lee family

formerly of North Carolina.

North Carolina?

Mm-hmm.

Where you headed,
Mr. Maws?

I wasn't headed for
your fence, Mrs. Lee.

I'm not exactly sure

where I'm headed.

I was just looking for
a place to park my engine.

Do you possess any
skills, Mr. Maws?

For instance, uh, carpentry?

I can pound a nail,
if that's what you're asking.

Matter of fact, I'm looking
for a job, if you're offering.

Do you believe in
accidents, Mr. Maws?

I believe
I just had one.

I don't... believe
in accidents, that is.

I believe everything
happens for a reason.

And I believe that if you're
not just looking for a job

but also for a new home,
you just found both.

Both?
Mm-hmm.

What do you think about that,
Mr. Abraham?

My dad's
usually right.

Your dad's
always right.

Put her there.
Come on in.

Come on in?

Yeah.

HUBERT:
You're a lucky
man, Pete Maws.

You've escaped the
"Iron Line of Necessity"

and become part of
the "Great Wall of Life."

Directionless just a
few short hours ago

you are now part of
the "Grand Design."

( chuckles )

Well, Mrs. Lee

you have yourself
two beautiful children.

Miss Louise,
I believe, favors you

and Mr. Abraham...

his father.

( Hubert chuckles )

At the risk of appearing nosy

Mr., Mr. Maws,
there's, uh...

well, there's something
about your story

I don't quite understand.

What's that, Mr. Lee?

You retired from the railroad?

Yes, sir.

On the Palm Coast Line,
in Florida?

Yes, sir, started out in linens

and worked my way up
through the dining car.

And I spent the last ten years
in charge of maintenance.

And the Palm Coast gave you
a pension?

The Palm Coast Line is under
the mistaken impression that...

I'm white.

You may have to explain

that one, Mr. Maws.

Well, Mrs. Lee, I was hired

with a bunch of boys
out of Palatka.

And, well, I was
the only one that could write

so I got to fill out
all the forms.

Now, you had to check either

that you were colored
or you were white.

At that time... I must have
been about Mr. Abraham's age...

and, well, I wished I was white.

So when it came down
to my own form

well, guess which one I checked?

Wasn't that a lie?

Yes, that's exactly what
it was, Mr. Abraham.

Big, old white lie.

I mean, as young as I was

I didn't know
that there's some things

that you just can't change
by wishing, you know?

And later on, well,
I felt more ashamed

about the wish than the lie

if you follow
my meaning.

You still look a little young
to retire, hmm?

Well, sir,
that's another lie I told.

Instead of 14, I wrote down
that I was 40 on the form.

Yeah, yeah, Mrs. Lee.
That's true.

You're looking at
a 65-year-old white man.

( laughter )

Are you, are you sure

you're telling us the truth
about all this, Mr. Maws?

Now, would I lie to you?

( chuckling )

Here's to retirement.

ALL:
Yes!

( giggling )

â™ª Joyful, joyful,
we adore Thee â™ª

â™ª God of glory, Lord of love

â™ª Hearts unfold
like flowers before Thee â™ª

â™ª Opening to the sun above

â™ª Melt the clouds
of sin and sadness â™ª

â™ª Drive the dark of doubt away

â™ª Giver of immortal gladness

â™ª Fill us
with the light of day â™ª

PRIEST:
Let us pray.

O Lord, be merciful
to your people.

Fill us with your gifts

and make us always
eager to serve you

in faith

hope and love.

( whispers ):
What's your name?

We ask this through
Christ, our Lord...

Amen.

( giggles )

A reading from the
First Epistle of Paul
to the Corinthians...

I'm Gary.

Gary.

"Now I will show you
the greater way

"which surpasses all others.

"If I speak with human tongues

"and angelic as well,
but do not have love

"I am a noisy gong,
a clanging cymbal.

"If I have the gift of prophesy

"and with full knowledge
comprehend all mysteries

"and have faith great
enough to move mountains

"but do not have love,
I am nothing.

"Love is patient.

"It is never self-seeking.

"Love never fails.

"Prophesies will cease.

"Tongues will be silent.

"Knowledge will pass away.

"In the end

"but three things last:
faith, hope and love.

And the greatest
of these is love."

( bells ringing )

Mrs. Lee, how nice to see you.

Mr. Knight.

LOUISE:
Mother, can I wait for you
across the street?

Close by, Louise.

I don't want to have
to search for you.
Yes, Mother.

I didn't know you were a member
of the parish, Mr. Knight.

Oh, I belong to seven churches
and, and a synagogue.

My vocation requires it.

( chuckles )

Does that make me
a hypocrite,

do you suppose?

Well, that would be
a rather harsh judgment.

Harsh, but perhaps just.

Faith and I have been resolute
strangers since my wife died.

Abraham, go keep
your sister company.

She's got company.

Yes, but I think she
could benefit from yours.

Dad said not to be late.

Go.

Mrs. Lee

I am happy
to run into you.

I've been wanting

to thank you
for intervening
with your husband.

Oh, what you were asking for
was more than reasonable.

Mrs. Lee, might I ask you

why he hates me so?

Oh, now, Hubert doesn't
hate you, Mr. Knight.

He hates...

the idea of you.

Ah, well...

that's reassuring.

( chuckling )

Have you been
down the street?

( indistinct )

Well, I think
it's a great success.

( laughter )

Mother's found an
admirer, Abraham.

Mom loves Dad.

EDNA:
It was kind of you

to give me that advice
about the schools.

KNIGHT:
Oh, I'm happy to
any... anytime.

EDNA:
I do appreciate it.

Bye-bye.
Bye.

Abraham, Louise.

Mr. Knight has suggested
a school for the two of you:

Saint Margaret.

Catholic school?

With nuns and uniforms?

Dad would never allow it.

Uh-huh...

Who's your favorite father?

My favorite father
wouldn't make me go
to Catholic school.

You'll have to take that up
with your favorite mother.

All right, how old
is the earth?

Millions
of years?
And how do we know?

Carbon dating.

Who's the father
of modern science?
Galileo.

And who had Galileo
thrown in prison

for telling the truth?

The Pope.

Where'd your mother
come up with this idea

is what I'd like to know.

All right.

Be careful, now.

Don't grow up now.

Don't you ever grow up now.

( school bell ringing )

( chattering )

Sister.
Mother.

( class murmurs )

MOTHER SUPERIOR:
Today is a special day, class.

( pounds on chalkboard )

Class!

Today it is my pleasure

to introduce to you, not one,
but two new classmates.

Ow!

( laughing )

Their names are

Abraham Jacob Lee

and Louise Janine Lee.

I'm sure you'll want to join me

in welcoming them.

( applause )

You may go to your seats.

GIRL ( whispering ):
I wonder what's wrong with her.

BOY ( whispering ):
I don't know, maybe...

Nice shot.

Thank you, Mother.

Today we are reading
Romeo and Juliet

Act Two, Scene One.

BOY:
Use this one here.

Come on.

You can look on with me.

Thank you.

( whispers ):
Have you read ever read
Romeo and Juliet before?

What scene is this?

Act Two, Scene One.

( both giggle )

LOUISE:
He dropped all this popcorn

and then he dropped
all the money my mother gave me.

Oh, hey, Louise,
you dropped this.

GIRL:
See you later, Grace.

Bye.

( chattering )

Hi.

Hi.

Your sister's really pretty.

Why was she limping before?

It only happens when
she's really nervous.

You'll probably
never see it again.

Well, it was really nice
the way you took care of her.

The nuns will make her
button her blazer.

They think the sight
of girls' breasts

inspires boys
to evil thoughts.

So, are you Chinese?

Louise and I were
born in Korea.

We were adopted
when we were little.

Do you know
who your parents are?

They're Hubert
and Edna Lee.

No. I mean your real parents.

They are our real parents.

I'm... sorry.
I didn't mean to...

No. That's okay.

We probably shouldn't
even be talking.

My father is Turner Knight,
you know.

I know.

I recognized you.

Guess that makes
you a Capulet.

And you a Montague.

Your top button
has to be fastened.

( school bell ringing )

( laughter )

MAN:
Come on, you guys.

So, what's it like

to live in the world's
largest movie screen?

Pretty normal mostly.

What's it like to live
in a funeral parlor?

Well, it's the same...
pretty normal.

Do you sleep
in a bed or a coffin?

( laughs )

So, since you work in the
Flamingo Drive-in and all...

Yeah.

Are there any
good movies?

No.

No? Not at all?

No. Not at all.

BOY:
...cheerleading class?

LOUISE:
Do you really think I should?

BOY:
Yeah. I definitely think
you should.

BOY:
They could really use
somebody like you.

I don't know.

LOUISE:
There's my dad.

I'll see you later.

BOY #2:
Take care. I'll see you.

Her name's Ashley.

And she's on... she's like...

Oh, that's so sweet.

LOUISE:
Abe. Come on.

Sorry. I-I have to go.

MAN:
So long now.

BOY #2:
Okay, I'll...

MAN:
We've got to get going.

BOY #2:
Okay.

LOUISE:
Hi, Mom.

EDNA:
How was it?

How was your school?

LOUISE:
Fine.

ABRAHAM:
Great.

You got a lot
of homework.

Yes.
No.

I'm glad you brought
your books home, Abe.

I'd like to have a look
through them.

Your father wants to check them
for Papal fallacies.

We've already read
most of them.

Our living room
has more books than
the school library.

HUBERT:
See? What
did tell you?

Maybe a donation
is in order.

You give hand-outs
to everyone else.

Fine with me, Edna.

I'll start making
a list of books

no high school library
should be without.

D.H. Lawrence,
Nabokov, Salinger.

So you make

any new friends?

Yeah.
Yeah?

Who's the young lady, Abe?

Which one?

Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

HUBERT:
Under the elms

just now.

I think her name was Grace.

Grace what?

Hubert.

Edna.

LOUISE:
Yeah, Abraham.

Grace what?

How come you two
are arguing so much lately?

Both:
Who?

( airplane whirring )

Here he comes.

( crowd chatting excitedly )

MAN:
Money. Money.

Watch this.
Watch. Watch.

He said he's going to do
a loop-de-loop.

Isn't that dangerous?

Don't you worry, son.

That is none other than

Judge Lester at the throttle.

He's the best circus pilot
in all of Dixie.

Rule #1 in business, son:
Advertise, advertise, advertise.

Rule Number Two:
Always, always hire the best.

Hey, what's that?

( gasping )

Oh!

Oh! Oh!

Whoo!

( gasps )

( frustrated muttering )

Come on.

Whoa!

Is he okay?

Uh... I think so.

I-I think he made it.

Hey!

You kids

stay away
from there now!

That's not a toy.

It's not exactly a
plane anymore, either.

Yeah. She'll need a little work
before she flies again.

Judge Lester, this
is my son, Abraham,
you remember?

Young man...

you are the spitting
image of your father.

Thanks.

Well, it could have been worse.

How?

You could have been killed.

These children

could have been killed.

( frogs croaking )

Could have been
better, too.

Mr. Lee

maybe this ain't such
a good idea.

Come along. Edna probably
doesn't even remember you.

It's okay. Come
on in. Come in.

Well...

Look what the cat dragged in.

Sweetheart.

( laughs )

Hi. Now, you may
not recall, but
this is Judge Lester.

He's the best stunt
pilot in all of Dixie.

Oh, I remember Judge Lester.

They finally run you out
of North Carolina, Judge.

HUBERT:
And-and this...

is our new projectionist,
Mr. Pete Maws.

Hey, Judge.

Well... an outdoor
cinematic technician.

Whoa!

Is that Miss Louise there?

Why, you're even prettier
than your pictures.

And old honest
Abe there, why

he-he looks like a...

a doctor.

Hey, how about some candy,
you two, huh?

Yeah. Take as
much as you want.

I got connections
with all the candy kings

of North America.

Whoo!

And, uh, Mrs. Lee...

the lady of the house
always deserves a gift

when a guest comes
for a long visit.

A long visit?

Um...

I've invited the judge
to work here at the Flamingo

for a while until he gets
his plane fixed up.

We had a little problem in town
this afternoon.

I know that, Hubert.

It was all over the radio.

You know what they call that,
Judge?

Hmm?

Free publicity.

Yeah.

Well, it's a good thing

we just made a $5,000 donation

to the Policeman's
Benevolent Fund

or you two overgrown adolescents
would be in jail

for public endangerment.

Rule #1 in business,
Abraham:

Always make friends
with the cops.

I thought Rule #1 was:

"Advertise, advertise,
advertise."

Well, Rule #2, then.

Dad, Rule #2
is "Always hire the best."

Okay, then, call it
2A and 2B.

Your father's full of #2,
isn't he?

( laughter )

Would you take
me flying?

EDNA:
Sweetie

the finest stunt pilot
in all

of Dixie just wrecked his plane.

Oh, there's lots of planes
for hire, Mrs. Lee.

I'll be glad to take you up.

Louise, darling, we don't
need to discuss that now.

Oh, Please, Daddy?
We really don't.

Please, Daddy, please.

Louise, no-no sugar.

Mom, please. I want to fly
more than anything.

You have to say yes. Please?

Louise!

Please?
No.

Please?

On one condition.

Anything. Anything.
I promise.

The Judge takes me up first
so I know it's safe.

But, Mom, you're scared
of heights.

You won't even go
up on the roof.

Oh, I think I'll be safe enough,
won't I, Judge?

You're a different man up here.

Aren't you, Judge?

Nothing to be afraid of
in the sky, Mrs. Lee.

It's down there
where everything gets messed up.

Up here...

Even I...

don't make you nervous.

Oh, not a bit, Mrs. Lee.

I got you just where I want you.

What do I do?
Yeah, that's good.

You all right?
I'm fine.

( laughing )

Yeah.

Whee!

LOUISE:
Thanks, Mom.

( laughing )

Come on, little lady.

Abraham...

you were really
worried about me,
weren't you?

Here comes our

next aviator.

( Abraham chuckles )

It's gorgeous.

( plane engine starting )

LOUISE:
Bye!

Bye.

SON:
Dad, can you listen?

DAD:
He is going to give us
a practical demonstration

of what I feel safe
in saying

is a pretty exciting
birthday present.

SON:
Dad, we need to talk
about this for a second.

DAD:
I can't hold them
much longer, Ben.

You'd better get out here.

SON:
I'd like to discuss this.

Hey, you're flexing
my face.
Air.

GARY:
Hey, fellas,
that's $3.75.

Oh, come on, man.
Give us a break.

Admission is one and a quarter
times three.

Makes $3.75, fellas.

Ah, man.

BOY:
Come on, fellas.

Let's bug out...

Come on, baby.

ABRAHAM:
Thanks a lot, guys.

Enjoy the show.

This remarkable young man

is going to perform for you...

I think your sister's
in love with me.

Don't you?

No.

Not even a little?

She loves the fact
that you love her.

That's not the same
thing, is it?

She wants to be
an actress.

That way everybody
will love her.

You could be one
of the everybody.

What I want to be
is the only body.

( laughing )

( coins clanking )

All right...

spill it.

What?

Whatever's wrong.

You've been moping
since yesterday.

You regret now
you didn't go flying.

No.

What then?

I wasn't supposed to know
about you and Grace Knight?

Is that it?

How did you find out?

You didn't invent

falling in love, Abraham.

You going to tell Dad?

You're going to.

Why not?

Shall I tell you why not?

You're not going to tell him
because you love him, right?

Because you're crazy
about Grace.

And because telling
your father

would serve no
useful purpose.

Do you like Turner Knight?

Yes, Abraham, I do.

Why do you have to talk to him
every Sunday after church?

I think I just answered
that question.

Were you paying attention?

Abraham, look at me.

Look at me.

Turner Knight

is a lonely man
in need of a friend.

That's all we are though
if that's what's worrying you.

I haven't told your father

about my friendship
with Mr. Knight.

The same reason you haven't
told him about Grace

because no possible good
could come of it.

Keeping a secret...

isn't that the same as a lie?

Abraham...

( sighs )

your father's right.

We shouldn't be sending you
to a Catholic school.

You were born a Jesuit.

( laughs )

Whoa.

Man:
Run. Run.

( can clanking )

HUBERT:
Abraham
Easy.

don't, uh... okay.

Here.

This boy...

he's either
real brave or...

he don't understand
too good.

PETE:
That boy's name
is Abraham.

And he's smart enough

not to drop that crate
in the first place.

You know what
would be extra neat?

Set them babies off

from the top
of the screen.

Too dangerous.

Let's just
go along

as we planned, okay?

Set them off
from the barge.

Just in case
anything happens...

there's an accident
or something

it happens right
over the water.

Now, if something
goes wrong up there

it's over a crowd
of people.

( groans )

Pete's right.

Well, I just don't see
what's going to go wrong,
I guess.

So, exactly who makes
the decisions around here?

I do.

And I like the idea
as much as you do, Judge

but Pete's right.

We're gonna fire the rockets
off the barge, like we planned.

( groans )

Except for the finale.

I don't see where
it'd hurt to shoot

the last four Rebel Dogs
off the roof.

Just when folks think
it's all over

bang, bang, bang!

Bang, bang.
Right in a row.

Right overhead.

Heck, that'd bring down
the house.

( laughing )

It's your house.

( laughing )

Are you ready
for the biggest

fireworks display ever witnessed
in the great state

of Florida, huh?

The line in front
of the snack bar

is going to wind halfway
to Jacksonville, son.

And you'll be glad
to know that I hired

I hired two extra
girls to help.

That way I can emcee things

instead of being stuck
behind the counter.

Uh, uh, Abraham, could...?

Yep...

about the finale...

Yeah, Dad.

I don't see what
where it's necessary

to tell your mother
about what we're planning.

Oh, you mean shooting
the Rebel Dogs off the roof
instead of the barge?

Shh, shh, shh.

Why, thank you.
Here.

You want me
to lie

to Mom?
No.

No, no, not lie.

Just...

Keep a secret?

Exactly. A small secret.

A small, insignificant
little secret.

Isn't a secret
the same as a lie?

I just don't see the point
in worrying her.

Do you?

Hi.

Oh, you-you
like the green?

I prefer the red.
Mm-hmm.

Hello, sugar.

Hot as a biscuit
today, isn't it?

( door closes )

( waves roaring )

( seagulls singing )

What?

It's nothing.

I just hate lying
to my father.

Well... it's not a lie.

You didn't lie to him.

Abraham, I snuck out
of the house.

If I'd asked
for his permission

he would have said no.

Well, they keep secrets,
too, you know?

Who?

My parents.

What are those lights
out on the water?

They're shrimp boats.

They like to
fish at night.

The shrimp are attracted
to the light.

It's all so beautiful.

I'm really glad
we're here.

LOUISE:
Abraham!

Abraham!

Have you
met her?
Met who?

Go, right this minute.
She's in the snack bar.

Hurry!

( loud rock music plays )

Hurry!

â™ª Judy in the sky

â™ª Hey, that's what you are

â™ª A lemonade pie

â™ª Hey, got your brand-new car

WOMAN:
Stare much?

â™ª Cantaloupe eyes come
jumping tonight â™ª

â™ª Judy in the sky

( giggles )

Who are you?

WOMAN:
Cat seems to have
got his tongue.

But unless I miss my guess

this is none other
than Abraham Jacob Lee

future heir
to the fortune

of Hubert Lee, our employer.

No one told me he was a mute,
though.

I'm not a mute.

Good.

The one you were admiring
over here

this is Polly.

And the one who scares you...

I'm Alice.

And I forgive you
for admiring her and not me.

â™ª Unzipping the strings
in my kite â™ª

So, um, what do people call you?

Abraham.

Hmm...

Then I'm going
to call you Jacob.

Aw, I like the way
you blush, Jacob.

â™ª Judy in the sky

You know we are going
to be very good friends

you and I.

Did you know that I used to go
to Saint Margaret myself

until I was expelled?

( laughing )

What for?

( giggles )

So what do you think?
Isn't she something?

Oh, she's gorgeous
all right, but...

Gorgeous?

Abe, I'm not talking about
the muffin in the mini.

I'm talking about Alice.

Don't you get it?

She's the
Alice King.
The?

Haven't you heard
the stories

about Alice King
at school?

She's a legend.

She's the one who got caught
dancing in her birthday suit

in the courtyard fountain
during the bishop's visit.

ABRAHAM:
I don't believe it.

It's true, Abraham,
I'm telling you.

( car horn honking )

I don't know.
That's a pretty small fountain.

( both laugh )

( up-tempo soul song plays )

No, no, no, no.

Go to the other side,
other side.

â™ª Show me a man out there
who's got a good woman â™ª

No, no...

( indistinct shouting )

No, you have to park.

No, you have to park.

Whoa.

â™ª Show me a man
that's got a good woman â™ª

â™ª Show me a man
that's got a good woman â™ª

â™ª Show me a man
that's got a good woman â™ª

( giggles )

( shouting playfully )

Bye-bye.

Bye.

Virgil.

Is it busy out there?

ROD STEIGER:
You take care, you hear?

Uh-huh.

MAN:
Excuse me.

Can I help you?

Two popcorns.

Psst...

MAN:
One with butter,
one without.

Would you like some advice?

Sure, I guess.

Okay, you like
Grace Knight...

right?

Yeah.

Then how come every
time Polly is around

you make a beeline
for her?

When you walk into a room
and there are two girls there

you don't always have to sit
next to the pretty one.

Popcorn.

PETE:
Abraham, Abraham.

listen, there's been
a change of plans.

Now, your dad's gone off
to the barge

to set the
fireworks off now.

He wants you to
find the Judge

and head to the top.

And he said remember your cue!

Got to go.

( Sousa march plays )

Your dad invited me
to come live with you guys
for the rest of the summer.

That's great.

He likes the regular crew
to live here.

He's neat, your dad.

There's the big, green one!

Th-that's our cue.

All right, get back there now.

Come on.

JUDGE LESTER:
There they go.

( cheers )

( groaning ):
What happened here?

It's a dud.

Judge!
Get down!
Hey!

( breaking glass )

Uh-oh.

MAN:
Hurry up!

Hurry up!

Daddy!
( coughs )

Damn.

Hold onto your sister.

You all right?

Yeah, we're all right.

( Sousa march stops )

JUDGE LESTER:
Uh-oh.

Oh, man...

Well...

it was the biggest
night in the history

of the Flamingo Drive-In.

Every single space
in that park

had a car sitting in it.

The snack bar broke
the record, right?

Abraham, we made more
money in one night

than we usually do
in a good week.

Subtract the cost of a new roof

for the Knight Funeral Home,
and what did we make?

Well, that's why we have
insurance, sweetheart

because accidents happen.

Oh, I'm sorry, Hubert.

Aren't you the one
that's always saying

there's no such thing
as an accident?

Or was that somebody else?

Turner Knight does
not need to worry.

He'll get his new roof.

That is not the point.

Good grief!

We almost burned
that man's house down.

If it hadn't rained when it did

that's exactly
what we'd be guilty of.

You did a bad
thing, Hubert.

You did it secretly,
because you knew I'd object.

And you!

You kept the secret.

It's not like you don't have
secrets, too, Mother.

I don't know what
you're talking about, Louise.

And do you know what?
Neither do you.

Now, you go upstairs
to your room

and you think about that
for a little while.

Abraham, you are not excused.

Don't you ever expect me
to apologize to Turner Knight.

EDNA:
I've already apologized.

What I want is
for you to quit

this senseless feud,
and leave the poor man alone.

All this is unnecessary, Hubert.

May I be excused?

Yes.

â™ª Let's just stay together

â™ª If you only know...

Aren't you going to ask me
if I got the job?

Did you get the job?

Yes, Abraham, I did.

You may now congratulate me.

I just don't see why
you need a job.

I don't need one.
I want one.

It was different
when I was teaching
you and your sister.

Now you're in school.

I could use a little help
filling up the days.

I was a teacher before
you came along, you know.

Who's going to
look after Dad?

Well, Abraham, it is true

your father needs more or less
constant supervision.

I guess we'll have
to take turns.

REPORTER:
To repeat this breaking story:
the Reverend Martin Luther King

has been shot and killed

by an assassin's bullet
in Memphis...

Oh, dear.

Witnesses say the shots
were fired from the window

of a building adjacent
to the Lorraine Motel...

â™ª Mmm...

Let's give Pete some
privacy, son, okay?

â™ª Mmm...

WOMAN:
I think she overdid it
a little bit, don't you?

WOMAN #2:
I completely agree.

GARY:
Great turnout.

WOMAN #2:
The flowers...

She just tries too hard.

How come your dad booked
The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom?

( chuckles )

Mom wanted to see it.

He's still trying to get
back on her good side.

She still hasn't
forgiven him?

Actually, she forgave
him right away.

Then why's he still
being so nice to her?

I don't know.
It's the way they are.

Don't your parents
ever argue?

No, that would require
my dad to speak.

( women laughing )

POLLY:
There you are!
What is it?

They need you
in the ladies' room!

Hurry!

Go! Go!

( knocking )

Read the sign!

ABRAHAM:
It's me, Alice.

Oh!

Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on...

Louise, go get
your mother!
Okay.

Take over
the ticket office for her!

ABRAHAM:
Is she sick?

Not anymore.

Ooh, she's...

You know what. Why don't you
go out and guard the door?

Don't let anybody in here.

Me, too.

No-no-no, no-no-no.
No! Not you, Jacob Lee.

What?

The door's locked
from the inside.

So?

So, climb.

Come on.

Oh!

( gasps )

The latch is stuck.

Well, you're upside
down, remember.

Try turning it the other way.

( sighing )

Okay, let me down.

ALICE:
Oh, you are kidding me.

Oh, my heavens!

What are we going to do?

I don't know, but it's
going to require...

a Phillips head
screwdriver.

Hi, hi. Um, I'm sorry, the
ladies' room is out of order.

Yeah.
But you can
use the men's.

( giggles )

Mr. Knight has the solution.

Come on.

Come along.
I'll show you what to do.

( siren wailing in distance )

That'll be the police.

I'll go wait for them.

Pete... you go on to bed.

Thank you.

You'll be all right.

Uh-huh.

ABRAHAM:
She looks so lonely.

We shouldn't
have moved her.

No. It was the right thing.

If that lady had been found
on your folks' property

the state would have
closed you down.

Maybe for a week...
or more.

Besides, it's better
if her family

remembers her like this.

Uh, here come
the professionals.

I'm to deliver a message
from my daughter.

She says she misses you.

I miss her, too.

Well, you can come
and visit Grace at our house

anytime you wish.

Evening, Mr. Knight.

Good evening, Randy.

Is she dead?

It would appear.

HUBERT:
I'll decide what we need
or do not need around here.

EDNA:
Listen to me,
Hubert...

Oh, for goodness' sake.

No, I don't care, Edna.
I don't want him here.

I asked him to come,
darling.

He's doing us a favor.

No, I don't want
any favors from him.

I don't want any
favors from him.
Come on.

Come on.

Edna, I do not believe

that I'm talking
to you right now.

It's all right.

RAYMOND:
Be easier

to just bury her
in the car.

Well, it would.

EDNA:
Morning!

KNIGHT:
Good morning to you.

How are you?

I'm just fine.

Did everything work out
to your satisfaction?

Thank you so much.

You're very welcome.

I'll see you later.

I hope so.

Don't worry, Dad.
We won't be late.

Abraham. Just the man
I was looking for.

I'm kind of late, Dad.

Oh, I think our
helpful neighbor

can wait a minute.

Is this going to be
an everyday thing?

Just till the end of school.

Mom says Mr. Knight

is going to...

going to drive us to school
in the morning

and she's going to bring us
home in the afternoon.

Huh...

Anyway...

feast your eyes on this.
Come here.

Come here, come here, come here.

Come on,
come on,
come on.

Not only is he
the world's largest

freestanding neon cowboy,
you know what else he is?

That's right, Abraham.

He's for sale.

But I like our flamingo.

I'm not talking
about getting rid

of the flamingo.

I don't get it.

What are we going to do
with a cowboy?

Hmm...

â™ª One, two, three, four

â™ª Sha, la, la-la-la-la,
live for today... â™ª

HUBERT:
I happen to own
this piece of land right here.

KNIGHT:
This will not stay
on my property.

( arguing )

LOUISE:
Uh-oh.

â™ª Hey, hey, hey

â™ª Sha, la, la-la-la-la,
live for today... â™ª

HUBERT:
You must think I'm crazy.

MAN 2:
Please yourself.

HUBERT:
Here you go.

Thank you
very, very much.

I appreciate you guys
and getting it done so quickly.

Okay, we'll see you.
All right, nice job.
Okay, thank you.

OFFICER:
Now, Mr. Knight,
is there going to be

any more problem
here today?

Mr. Knight?

No more trouble, Cal,
I can promise you that.

Mr. Knight and I
are going to establish

a peaceable kingdom
right here in the
Sunshine State.

Right, partner?

Hey, whoa!

Back up! Back up!

Come on!
Come on!

Hey, back off!
Let go!

Hey! Whoa!
Come on, now!

Hey, hey, back off!
Back off!

All right, Hubert...

that does it.

HUBERT:
Do I or do I not have a
perfectly legal right to erect

a sign on
my own property?

You have every legal right,
Hubert.

No one's saying
you don't own the land.

Except for the one tiny acre
Turner's business is on

you own everything
around here.

Oh, so he's "Turner"
now, is he?

And what does
he call you? "Edna"?

Don't change the subject,
Hubert!

You're a rich man
and you're abusing your power.

What's worse,
all you're really proving

is how small you can be.

You're still angry because
Turner Knight came over here

and helped us out
when we needed it.

Oh, Hubert Lee needed
Turner Knight? Ha!

You're moving that cowboy.

When pigs fly, Edna.

Not only are
they going to fly

they're going to fly
first thing tomorrow morning.

When I get home
from school

I expect to see the air
full of flying pigs.

Well, that's just too bad
if he can't take a joke.

( grunts )

I just... ( grunts )

I'm never going
to see Grace again.

( horses whinny )

Sorry about that bump.

MAN:
Are you going to come up here
and help me or not?

MAN 2:
I'm a passenger, not a driver.

Hyah!

( horses whinny )

( laughs )

( electrical buzzing )

Ow! Ow!

( grunts )

Actor:
Hey, grandpa...

( dog barks in distance )

( Edna panting )

You wouldn't think it

but this is much scarier
than flying in a plane.

So, you feel like
talking about it?

What's there to talk about?

We're freaks.

That's what you think?

Mom, we live in a movie screen.

People are laughing at us

and everybody thinks
we're crazy.

Who thinks we're crazy?

Name one person
who thinks we're crazy.

Everybody thinks... Dad's crazy.

Uh-huh.

Why did he do it?

Put the cowboy there?

Like most people

your father's... complicated.

I don't want him
to be complicated

and I don't want him
to be crazy.

Because if he's crazy,
then you're crazy to love him.

Abraham...

your father went halfway around
the world to fight a war...

and every minute he was there,
he was surrounded by death.

A lot of men brought that death
home with them

but not your father.

He brought life...

two lives:
yours and your sister's.

There are times, like this
afternoon with the cowboy

when your father will follow
a notion

that seems a bit nutty, maybe.

And there are times
I would like to wring his neck.

But, sweetie, that's love.

I love your father

and so do you.

Every now and then Hubert Lee
needs to be saved from himself

but that's my job.

You want to make a little wager

what side of the highway
that big ugly cowboy will be on

this time tomorrow?

No.

That's where you're smart.

â™ª For goodness' sake,
I got the hippie-hippie shakes â™ª

â™ª Yeah, I got the shakes

â™ª I got
the hippie-hippie shakes â™ª

Mm-hmm.

â™ª Oh! I can't sit still

â™ª With the
hippie-hippie shakes... â™ª

Mom, can I fly
again, please?

You'll have to
ask the Judge.

You should go up,
too, sweetie.

Flying gives you

the most astonishing feeling
of... freedom.

It's almost like
you're not really tied

to anything down here.

I like it down here.

I don't want it
to be different.

LESTER:
Whoo!

Hold on, now. Here we go!

So, was it fun?

( sighs )

I just hope

falling in love will be
as exciting as flying...

but I just know it won't.

Abraham, I'd like
to ask your opinion
about something.

Turner Knight wants to put in
a cemetery

in back of his funeral home.

For the last few months,
he's been after me

to sell him a parcel
of our land.

But you don't have
to sell it to him, do you?

Legally, no.

No, but he did do us a favor
with that lady who died

and so now he figures
I owe him.

What does Mom think?

Well, I have
to hand it to him.

He never mentioned
it to your mother.

I think you should
sell him the land.

Yes. Yes, you're
probably right.

But I can't.

Because if I do, he'll stay.

Then again, maybe I'm the one
who should give up.

Give up what?

Well, the Flamingo,
for one thing.

I mean...

more drive-ins
close down every year.

Some people say
there's no future in it

and they-they could be right.

But it's our home.

The best home in the world.

Yeah. That's true.

Dad?

Mom never liked Turner Knight,
you know.

She loves you.

Why?

Haven't you ever wondered why

your mother could love
a man like... like me?

No.

( plane whirring )

Here she comes!

She's coming back.

Of course she is.

When do you think your
husband might be willing

to discontinue his feud?

With Hubert, one... never knows.

He's nothing if not
full of surprises.

Which is...

one of the reasons I love him.

I have a confession
to make...

which shames me.

Your husband has not
hated me more than
I have hated him.

No man should
be so lucky.

I've often wondered,
Mr. Knight...

Would you call me Turner?

If I promise never
to embarrass you again

would you do me that honor?

I've often wondered, Turner

does Grace resemble

her mother?

More and more every day.

She was so...

I have been slow to understand
that for me

there will never be another.

And I take your point, Edna...

that I have been lucky, too.

Very nice.

Very nice.
It's very impressive.

All right, well, let me show you
how this deal works.

Step over here.

Oh, watch the wire.

Oh!

Okay, you got your two buttons.

They're marked #1.

#1.
And #2.

It's foolproof.

When you get

over the drop area,
you press #1.

That releases the
"Banner of the 10,000
Illuminations"

from this hook.

Come here. Let me show you.

Come on.

From this hook right back here.

You all see it?

Hook.

I see it.

Next, you look behind you

to make sure the banner
has been released.

Why?

I'll tell you why.

Because if it is not
released, you won't
ever touch #2.

Why?

I'll tell you why.

Because that will ignite
that son of a gun

too close to your airplane.

So, we're going to drop
a bomb on our audience.

Safer than

dropping a payload of feathers.

Provided you're up
at least 1,300 feet.

Now, I've already arranged

for the fire truck
to be on hand, just in case.

You won't need
no fire truck

as long as you stay
above 1,300 feet.

Yeah, right.

Guarantee you one thing.

Everybody looking up will swear
the sky is raining fire.

HUBERT:
Well, that's what
we want, right?

Something they'll remember
all winter long.

That way they'll come back
when we reopen next spring.

Oh, they'll remember.

Yeah, okay, thank you.

You got it?

Oh, yeah.

HUBERT:
All right.

Sure you got that?

You want to have fun?

Drop that payload
right on top

of that undertaker fellow
you don't like.

He'll think the angels
in all their glory

have come down from heaven
to fetch him on high!

HUBERT:
That would
be something.

You've done
a wonderful job.

I really want
to thank you.

EDNA:
Every now and then

Hubert Lee needs
to be saved from himself.

â™ª Oh, the rules
were changed today â™ª

â™ª Hey! â™ª

â™ª I have no place to stay

â™ª Hey! â™ª

â™ª Thinking about the subway

â™ª Hey! â™ª

â™ª The love has gone away

â™ª Hey! â™ª

â™ª My tears have come and gone

â™ª Hey... â™ª

â™ª Time! â™ª

â™ª Time... â™ª

Mm-hmm.

( snoring )

( movie plays in background )

ABRAHAM:
Hey, Mom!

Hey, Mom,
Alice needs some quarters.

You're just the person
I was looking for.

Abraham, hold on.
I want to talk to you.

She needs them right away.

Yesterday, in fact.

Hey, Mom?

Is everything okay?

Yes, Abraham.

Don't worry so.

Everything's fine.

Girls... order, order!

â™ª Tell me again
just like you told me â™ª

â™ª Is it a dream or can I fly?

â™ª Far beyond the far horizon

â™ª Where there are
no borderlines... â™ª

Girls,
four minutes to intermission.

There appears

to be an epic lack of discipline

in these environs tonight,
Jacob!

So, what are you going to do
in the off-season, Alice?

Well, it's
a sad story, Jacob

but Polly and I
are going

to have to join
the hoochy-koochy show

until the Flamingo
opens up again
in the spring.

Who'd pay to see you,
Alice?

Hey, I've got news
for you, Missy.

Five years from now

after you have made
the transition

to size 18 maternity dresses

they'll still be
chasing after me

Miss Polly-Wolly!

( laughter )

So where's Mom?

Isn't she going to help
with the rush?

Nope, she decided to go up
with the Judge.

She did?

Why?

Um, there was some
sort of problem

with the Banner of the
10,000 Illuminations.

The Judge fixed it.

Fixed it?

Actually, I think
your mother wanted
to make sure

there was no repeat
of the last fireworks
fiasco.

She wanted to make sure
that old fool

dropped his payload
over the ocean

not the funeral home.

Jacob?

Jacob?

â™ª Time has come today

â™ª Time has come today

...because we have for you
a celestial conflagration

the likes of which we have
never witnessed anywhere.

Hey, Abraham,
ready for the fireworks?

Now, I want y'all to do
a little favor for me now.

I want y'all reaching up toward

the celestial lights.

Yeah, that's right!

Because what we have for you
tonight on this Labor Day

is the Banner of 10,000
Illumination Lights!

Yeah!

( amplified heartbeat )

Now, what's that?

Do you hear that?

I hear something coming...

( labored breathing )

( crowd clamoring )

There she is.

EDNA:
How beautiful it all is.

How incredibly beautiful.

HUBERT:
I hear something coming

so look to the firmament now,
ladies and gentlemen

because I give you...
the universe!

( cheering and applause )

( hammer clicks )

No!

No!

Shh...

( sobbing )

( crowd sobbing )

( thunder rumbling )

I wonder if
I might come in.

( sniffling )

The land for the
cemetery is yours

if you still want it

and if you would allow me
to select her plot.

Yes.

Would you care to...?

Yes. Yes, thank you.

That would...

Thank you.

I don't know how to thank you,
Mr. Knight.

You have
a very, very great skill.

No, it is my sons
you wish to thank.

I could not.

Going to the funeral?

Do you want
to tell me why you knew

what was going to happen
before it did?

No.

Why don't you tell me anyway?

Want to have a little fun?

Drop that payload

Right on top of that
undertaker fella

you don't like.

He'll think the angels
in all their glory

have come down from heaven
to fetch him on high!

That would be
something.

Think about it.

EDNA:
Every now and then
Hubert Lee needs

to be saved from himself.

( heartbeat )

ABRAHAM:
When the judge fixed the wires

he must have spliced them
the wrong way.

When he pushed the button
to release the banner...

I killed her, Alice.

Oh, come here, sweetheart.

It was an accident, Jacob.

Now, you listen
to me, okay?

Listen.

I know that
it doesn't feel like it now

but one day you are going
to forgive yourself, Jacob.

And it won't be because you feel
like you deserve it.

It'll be because you realize

that your mother has
already forgiven you.

She forgave you in advance.

And there's something else
you've been wrong about, Jacob.

You've always thought
of yourself

as your father's son

but you are her son, too.

You have her faith, Jacob.

God forgives you.

Your mother forgives you...

and one day
you will forgive yourself.

Come on.

Your father needs you.

ABRAHAM:
Alice was right, of course.

With my mother gone

my father did need me
far more than I knew.

This will be a fine cemetery,
won't it, Abraham?

And this, right here

will be the finest plot.

But you do see
the problem, though.

I won't put her
in the dark, Abraham.

I can't.

If ever there was a woman
who deserved to see the sun

that woman was your mother.

ABRAHAM:
"Biology," my father always
told me when I was little

"has got nothing to do
with parenthood."

He was right.

No mother was ever more real
than mine.

I was kissed every night
and told that I was loved.

The night Edna Lee
fell from the sky

was the night Hubert T. Lee,
my real father

saw that Death had crossed
the highway, not just to
visit.

And in time,
hope rose from the ashes

of the Flamingo Drive-in
Theater...

for my father, for my sister

and yes, even for me

Abraham Jacob Lee.
