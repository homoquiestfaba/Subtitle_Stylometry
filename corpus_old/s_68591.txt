This "pestilent dust"
has appeared only three times.

It was found to be limestone...
Messy, but innocuous.

Innocuous?
Harmless.

I know what it means. May l?

Your Honour...

Imagine how
the neighbourhood children feel.

The pounding of construction
ringing in their ears.

This skyscraper, a tribute
to mankind's greed, grows daily.

It casts a shadow over their lives
and surrounds them with toxic dust.

Kendall Construction is rebuilding
this neighbourhood.

Granting a restraining order here
will throw 753 people out of work.

You cannot validate this groundless
example of rapacious litigation.

It is a threat to our society.
Let's not go off the deep end.

You have made
a compelling case, Mr. Miller.

But there is no irreparable harm.
Not yet.

Is that you?
Yeah, it's me.

A client of yours?
Funny!

Excuse me, sir...

I went to a restaurant the other day
and ordered coffee.

The waiter asked, "Would you
like sugar or Sweet & Low?"

I said, "Do I look like
I should be on a diet?"

Andy.
Hi, Doc.

Your blood work came back.
When I return, we'll discuss it.

I'll be right here.

Hi, how are you feeling?
Pretty good.

Make a fist for me.

We're gonna have to start
looking for veins in your feet.

Terrific job on the Kendall case.
Thanks, Kenneth.

Anthea, just the paralegal
extraordinaire I was hoping to see.

The answer is no.
Dinner at Felicia's...

I've got a class.
My briefs need proofing.

Exploit somebody else.
Since you've asked...

Your exam!
98.

98! Congratulations!

Let's talk about the Hansen case.
Yeah. Thank Amy for the painting.

Here are the numbers. The copy's
on your desk. Do you need me?

No. It's 6:30. Go home.

Hello? Hi, darling.
What a surprise. How are you?

Good.
-what does Dr. Gillman say?

She says I am fine.
My blood work is excellent.

How about my platelets?
Even myplatelets look good.

Mom, more importantly,
how are you?

I'm fine. Your dad is fine.
-what are you doing?

Andy, am I interrupting you?
In a word, Bob.

Charles wants to see you upstairs.

I was just about to take a break.
You're sure I'm not underdressed?

Andy has expressed a keen interest
in Highline versus Sander Systems.

The participants interest me.
It's an anti-trust action.

Is it? Sander Systems copies
Highline's spreadsheet program.

For me, the legal principle involved
is copyright infringement.

Tell me this, Andy.which side would
you like to see emerge victorious?

Don't be influenced by my friendship
with Sander's CEO Billwright.

I'd like to see Highline win.
-why, Beckett?

If Sander Systems wins, an energetic
young company is destroyed.

Copyright laws were enacted to stop
exactly what Sander are doing.

You know who reps Highline.
Rodney Bailey.

He couldn't find his way around
copyright law with a map.

Apparently the fellas
at Highline agree with you.

Therefore, as of 9:03 this evening,
right after the dessert course,

they're now represented by Wyant,
Wheeler, Hellerman, Tetlow & Brown.

Outstanding!

And more specifically,
senior associate Andrew Beckett.

Thank you, Robert.
Start on Highline right away.

I'm right on it.
-we have to file within ten days.

Tokyo on line four, Bob.
-walter, thank you.

Thank you, Kenneth.
Congratulations.

What's that on your forehead?
Where?

That, right there on your forehead.

I got whacked
with a racquet ball... Excuse me.

Charles... I sincerely appreciate
your faith in my abilities.

Faith is a belief in something
for which we have no evidence.

It does not apply in this situation.

Go home.
No... go back to work!

Thank you, Charles.
No sweat, buddy.

Tommy, how are you?

The complaintis on my desk, Shelby.
Tell Jamey to get on top ofit

Anything else?

No, I'll be working out of the house
for the rest of the afternoon.

Bye.

You want to apply the foundation
as evenly as you can.

It shouldn't look like
you threw it on with a spoon.

You don't think this
is a little too orange for me?

It's Tahitian Bronze.
That works best on these lesions.

Say you've been to Aruba.
I've called in sick for four days.

Now they'll think I was on a cruise.

Fax.
Thank you, Bruno.

We could try this Light Egypt...

What?
Andy?

Excuse me.

Just like my cousin Fredo.

Hi... Does anybody want a bagel?

Are you okay, Andy?

I need to go to the hospital.

It's all right.
I'm getting out of here.

One more.
Thank you for driving me here.

I told Dr. Gillman to take a day off
and she took a day off!

Did they take a specimen?
Blood... I'm empty.

You have a fever, baby.

This is my guy. Excuse me...
Just one second.

I ran to the bathroom. I almost
lost it in front of everybody.

It's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's just...

Any news on my blood work?
No.we'll do a colonoscopy.

It sounds delightful.
-wait.why do that?

-who are you?
-who are you, Doctor...

This is my partner.

He records all my hospital visits.
I'm Dr. Klenstein.

A colonoscopy will show us if it's
the K.S. causing the diarrhoea.

It could be an infection...
A reaction to AZT.

That's possible...

He's not having this
until we cancel out everything else.

I'm trying to help your partner.
You're not a member of his family.

I could have you removed.
He's upset. He's sorry.

No, don't apologize for me.
Okay, he's not sorry.

Let's see what the blood work
tells us. I'll give a specimen.

Maybe we'll hear from Dr. Gillman.
Everybody happy?

I'll check on the blood work.
Sorry...

That's the third time.
Dr. Klenstein...

I have to call the office.
I want you to relax.

I am relaxed.
Good. Is there a phone around?

If you have been injured, you may
be entitled to a cash settlement...

Good Lord!

Mr. Beckett's office.
Shelby, it's me.

Mr. Beckett's office.
Shelby, it's me.

Jamey beeped me.
I'm glad you called.

It's about the Highline complaint.
Jamey is going ballistic!

Calm down. Put him on.
One second.

Where's the Highline complaint?
Wait! Slow down.

It was supposed to be here
this morning.

I left it in my office last night.
I put the corrected copy on my desk.

I'm telling you, it's not here.
All right, try my hard disk.

You'll have
to printit outyourself.

What did you file it under?
HL1.

You know that there's
a statute oflimitations on this.

It runs out...

in 75 minutes.

It's not here. Andy.
It's not there? I'm on myway!

Every problem has a solution.

Push, baby.

It's a girl!

Take a picture, Joe.
I can't get the film in there.

Help me, baby.

Look at her. A sweet little...

She's perfect.

Go down to the deli.
Get a pound of Scotch salmon.

Rolls, bagels...
Give me a call.

And some champagne.
You're that TV guy.

Dom Perignon.

$100? No, get a nice Californian.

Get it over here, she's starving.
No, not the baby... Lisa!

Iris... anybody call?
Yes, an Andrew Beckett

Who's Andrew Beckett?
Hey, Joseph!

Explain it like I'm a six-year-old.

The entire street is clear except
for a large hole under construction.

It's marked and blocked off.

You decide to cross the street
and fall down the hole.

Now you want to sue the city.
Yes. Do I have a case?

Yeah, of course you do.
Great.

Go with my assistant lris.
Sort out the fee arrangement.

We take no cash
unless we get justice.

How's your back? Any pain?
Now that you mention it...

Iris, take good care of him.
I will. Mr. Beckett's here.

Mr. Beckett.

Come in.

Good to see you again, counsellor.
Judge Tate. Kendall Construction.

"Innocuous!"

What happened to your face?
I have AIDS.

I'm sorry.

Can I sit down?
Yeah.

Look at this...
you have a new baby.

Yeah, a little baby girl.

"It's a girl". Congratulations.
Yeah, one week old.

Kids are great.
Yeah, I'm real excited about it.

What can I do for you?
I've been fired by Wyant Wheeler.

I want to sue them
for wrongful termination.

You want to sue Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow & Brown?

Yes. I'm seeking representation.
Continue.

I misplaced an important complaint.
That's their story.

Do you want to hear mine?

Have you been to other lawyers?
Yes, nine.

Continue.

The night before it was due, I left
a copy of the complaint on my desk.

The next day the complaint vanished.
No hard copy.

All traces of it mysteriously gone
from my computer.

Miraculously, a copywas found
justin time to getit to court

But the next day lwas summoned
to a meetingwith the partners.

Hello, Andy. Come on in.
Hit the windows.

Thanks. Come on in.
Hello, everybody.

Thanks for coming in.

Before we begin, I'd like to say
that everyone here is your friend.

I know that, Charles.
More than your friend. Family.

Charles... I must apologize again
for the Highline mishap yesterday.

That was some scary moment
around here.

Thank God that no damage was done.

This time.what about next time?
There won't be a next time.

Something's come over you lately.
I don't know...

A kind of stupor or fogginess.
You have an attitude problem.

Really?

Who thinks that?
I do.

Excuse me...
Am I being fired?

Let me put it this way: Your place
at this firm is no longer secure.

It isn't fair to keep you here
when your prospects are limited.

I don't want to rush you...
We've got a committee meeting.

This is preposterous.
It doesn't make any sense.

You do have an attitude problem.
Take it easy.

Why did you ever give me Highline?

You nearly blew the entire case.
It could have been a catastrophe.

You concealed your illness.

That's correct.

Explain it like I'm a two-year-old.
I can't seem to grasp this.

Weren't you obliged to tell
your employer you had AIDS?

That's not the point.

I always served my clients
with absolute excellence.

If they hadn't fired me,
I'd still do that.

They couldn't fire you
for being sick,

so they tried
to make you look imcompetent.

Correct. I was sabotaged.

I don't buy it, counsellor.

That's very disappointing.
I don't see a case.

I have a case.

If you don't want it...
That's correct. I don't.

Thank you for your time.

Mr. Beckett...

I'm sorry about what happened.
It's a bitch.

Have a nice day, Mr. Beckett.
What's the matter with that guy?

Iris, get me Armbruster.

I want to see Armbruster
sometime this afternoon.

Right away, Iris.

HIV-virus can only be transmitted
by the exchange of bodily fluids.

Blood, semen,
and vaginal secretions.

But they're finding out new things
about this disease every day.

Today you tell me there's no danger.

But six months from now
you may know different.

Maybe you can carry it
on your shirt or your clothes.

What are you doing?

We're gonna draw blood.
Why?

Joe, I've known you a long time.
Your private life is your business.

I don't need an AIDS test.
Just send the bill to my office.

Thanks for the information.

You have a problem with gays.
Not especially.

Do you know any gays?
Do you?

Yes.
-who?

Karen Berman. My Aunt Teresa.

Cousin Tommy in Rochester.
Eddie Meyers from the office.

Stanley, who fixed the kitchen.
Aunt Teresa is gay?

That beautiful, voluptuous woman
is a lesbian?

Since when?
Probably since she was born.

I admit it, okay. I'm prejudiced.
I don't like homosexuals.

The way they do that thing.
Don't they get confused?

"Is this yours or mine?"

I don't want to be in bed with
anybody who is stronger than me.

You can call me old-fashioned
and conservative, but I'm a man.

Any man will tell you
how disgusting that whole idea is.

Little cave man of the house.
You damn skippy.

Stay away from your Aunt Teresa.
Don't say that to her.

Guys trying to be macho
and faggot at the same time.

I'm being totally honest with you.
Yeah, you are.

Would you accept a client
if you were constantly thinking:

"I don't want this person
to touch me or even breathe on me?"

Not if I was you, honey.
Exactly...what?

Merry Christmas.

Thank you.
Happy New Year.

You're the...
TV guy.

This is the supplement.

You're right. There is a section
on HIV-related discrimination.

Thank you very much.

We do have
a private research room.

I'm fine right here.
I'm looking for the Murdoch case.

Just a moment.

Wouldn't you be more comfortable
in a research room?

No...
would it make you more comfortable?

Beckett, how are you doing?

Counsellor.

Whatever, sir.

Excuse me.

Who did you get?
Did you find a lawyer?

I'm a lawyer.

How's your baby?
She's... wonderful.

What's her name?
Larice.

That's a beautiful name.
We named her after my sister.

Look...

How did they find out you had AIDS?

One of the partners
noticed a lesion on my forehead.

But how..?

How do you go from that,
which could have been anything,

to deducing that you had AIDS
and terminating you on that basis?

That's a good point.

The partner who spotted the lesion,
Walter Kenton,

worked forwalsh, Ulmer & Brahm
in D.C.

A paralegal there, Melissa Benedict,
showed lesions on and off.

It was common knowledge
that she had AIDS.

But they didn't fire her.
No, they did not fire her.

Have you got a relevant precedent?

The Arline decision...
Supreme Court.

"The Federal Rehabilitation Act
of 1973,

prohibits discrimination
against handicapped persons

if they can perform the duties
required of them".

"Though the ruling did not specify
AIDS discrimination..."

"subsequent decisions have held
that AIDS is a handicap

because of the physical
limitations it imposes

and the prejudice surrounding it,
which exacts a social death...

that proceeds
the actual physical one".

"This is the essence
of discrimination".

"Formulating opinions about others
not based on their merits,

but on their membership in a group
with the same characteristics".

Charleswheeler.
Julius Erving. Glad to see you.

Ken Starr.

It'll only take a minute.

Charleswheeler. How are you doing?
A summons for you.

Take a look at it.
Dr. J., you're the best.

If you ever need a lawyer,
just give me a call.

See you in court.

You're the TV guy.

What's up?

I want to know everything
about Andy's personal life.

Does he frequent
those pathetic bars?

What other homosexual facilities
does he go to?

What deviant groups
does he secretly belong to?

What is it, Bob?
Let's make a settlement offer.

Andy brought AIDS into our offices,
into our men's room.

He brought AIDS
to our annual family picnic!

We ought to be suing him.
Show some compassion.

We gave him Highline.

Did Beckett say, "I won't be able to
function to the best of my ability?"

Now, discarding the trust
I conferred upon him,

Andrew Beckett proposes
to haul me into court.

To sling accusations at me.
To call me a bigot...

in full view of the Philadelphia
judicial establishment.

Beckett doesn't want to go to court.

A jury might side with him.
Wait a minute...

He was fired for incompetence,
not because he has AIDS.

Did you know he was sick?
Did you, Bob?

No... not really.

Everybody,
this is the house that I grew up in.

Right here in
Lower Merion, Pennsylvania.

Here's proof.

There. My hand prints
from when I was a cute little boy.

Today is the 40th wedding
anniversary of my mom and dad.

A tough life in all that poverty.
Those can be some mean streets.

Here's the front door. I once
broke this finger in this door.

Where's my brother?
There's my sister Jill.

Say hello, Alexis.
Mommy's pregnant again.

Are you really?

Hello, Meghan.
Uncle Andy.

Where's Dad?
Fixing the snowblower.

It snows once in seven years,
and Dad buys a new snowblower.

How are you?
Today's a good day.

Meghan, you're doing a great job.
I've got to say hello to my sisters.

Put me down!

Parts of the trial
will be hard for you to hear,

about my personal life.
And there's going to be publicity.

Do you want me to take her?
No, she's fine.

I think it's great you're asking...
but this is really your call.

Thanks, brother.

You're my kid brother.
That's all that matters, okay?

To be honest,
I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy.

They've been through so much, and
there are some tough times ahead.

Andy, the way that you've
handled this whole thing...

you and Miguel...
with so much courage...

There's nothing
that anybody could say

that could make us feel anything
but incredibly proud of you.

I didn't raise my kids
to sit in the back of the bus.

You get in there
and you fight for your rights.

I love you guys.

Ladies and gentlemen...

Forget everything you've seen
on TV and in the movies.

There will be no surprise witnesses
or tearful confessions.

You're going to be presented
with a simple fact.

Andrew Beckett was fired.

You'll hear two explanations
for why he was fired.

It is up to you
to sift through the facts

until you determine
what you think to be the truth.

Certain points must be proven.
One: Andrew Beckett was...

is a brilliant lawyer.

Two: Andrew Beckett,
has a debilitating disease.

He made the legal choice to keep
this fact from his employers.

Three: His employer discovered this.
The illness here is AIDS.

Four: They panicked.

They did what most of us
would like to do with AIDS.

Get it and everybody who has it
as far away from us as possible.

Such behaviour may seem reasonable
to you. It does to me.

AIDS is an incurable disease.

But no matter what moral judgement
you make upon his employers,

the fact that Beckett was fired
because he had AIDS...

means they broke the law.

Fact:

Andrew Beckett's performance
on the job varied from competent...

to, often times, mediocre...

to sometimes
flagrantly incompetent.

Fact:

He claims
he's the victim of lies and deceit.

Fact:

It was Andrew Beckett who lied
about his disease to his employers.

Fact:

He was successful in his duplicity.

The partners at Wyant Wheeler
did not know

that Andrew Beckett had AIDS
when they fired him.

Fact:

Andrew Beckett is dying.

Fact:
Andrew Beckett is angry.

His lifestyle and reckless behaviour
have cut short his life.

In his anger and rage
he is lashing out.

He wants someone to pay.

Thank you.

Andrew Beckett represented
your firm in 1990, is that correct?

That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?

We were satisfied
with the outcome of the litigation.

Satisfied.

Mr. Laird, you gave me sworn
testimony in your deposition.

Is that correct?
Correct.

You said you were impressed
and delighted with Beckett's work.

Do you recall saying that?

In all honesty I was delighted
with aspects of Andy's efforts.

But in general, I found the work
to be merely satisfactory.

Do you agree...

that a baloney sandwich
is a satisfactory meal?

Whereas, caviar and champagne,
roast duck and baked Alaska...

might be considered delightful?

We object. These gastronomical
comments are irrelevant.

Five months ago you characterised
Andrew Beckett as caviar.

Now he's a baloney sandwich.

What powerful force
caused this change of mind?

He hasn't changed his mind.
He's amplified his answer.

Objection sustained.

Mr. Laird, explain this to me
like I'm a four-year-old.

Did Andrew Beckett
win your lawsuit for you?

Yes, we won.
Congratulations, what a...

satisfactory experience.

Ready, Mr. Beckett.

Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

Do you see this
as a gay-rights issue?

I am not political.
I just want what is fair.

You are gay?

That's none ofyourbusiness,
butyes, I am.

Do homosexuals
deserve special treatment?.

Hell no!

Philadelphia
is the city ofbrotherly love.

The Declaration oflndependence
was signed here.

That documentsays:

"All men are created equal".

Give me a break.

We scorn discriminatorypractices.
Thank you, Mayor.

You're not getting a little light
in the sneakers, are you, pal?

Yeah, I am, Filko. I'm changing.

I'm on the prowl.

And I'm looking for a hunk.
A real man... like you.

You know what we do.
You want to play sailor?

Columbus and the first mate.
That's not funny!

These people make me sick...
but the law's been broken.

You remember the law, don't you?

At least we agree on one thing.
-what's that?

Tutti-fruttis make me sick, too.

Ms. Benedict, you worked
forwalsh, Ulmer & Brahm.

At the same time as Walter Kenton?
That's correct.

He knew the lesions on your face
and arms were caused by AIDS?

Definitely, I told all the partners.

How did Walter Kenton
treat you after that?

Every time we met,
he'd get this look on his face.

The "Oh God!" expression. As in,
"Oh God, that woman has AIDS".

Thank you. No more questions.

Ms. Benedict,
how did you contract AIDS?

Through a transfusion
just after childbirth.

So it was not your behaviour
which caused you to be infected.

You were unable to avoid it.

I guess.

Thank you.

But I don't consider myself
different to anyone else with AIDS.

I'm not guilty. I'm not innocent.
I'm just trying to survive.

Thank you, Ms. Benedict.
No further questions at this time.

You may step down, Ms. Benedict.

Apart from the marks on his face,
were there other things

that made you suspect he had AIDS?

He was thin and he seemed tired,
but he was working so hard.

Something was wrong.

They're trying to pretend
that they didn't notice anything.

Objection.
Just answer the question.

Have you ever felt discriminated
against at Wyant Wheeler?

Yes.
In what way?

Mr. Wheeler's secretary Lydia

said that Mr. Wheeler
had a problem with my earrings.

Apparently Mr.wheeler felt
that they were too "ethnic".

She told me he'd like something
a little less garish...

Something more "American".
What did you say?

I said, "My earrings are American.
They're African-American".

Let's have order, please.
No more questions.

Ms. Burton,
weren't you recently promoted?

Yes, I'm in charge
of the paralegal department.

Congratulations on your unfettered
success at Wyant Wheeler.

Unfettered?

I don't understand this.

The promotion of an obviously
intelligent, articulate...

qualified
African-American woman

in a firm which practices
wanton discrimination.

That is what's claimed here.
I can't explain it.

Could it be that
these instances of discrimination

are in fact misunderstandings that
have been blown out of proportion?

I think counsel tends
to oversimplify the issue.

Thank you, Ms. Burton,
I'll take that into consideration.

How's the trial going?

I saw you on TV.
I'm a law student at Penn.

You saw me on TV?
It's a good school, Penn.

I'm in my second year.
I just wanted to tell you
