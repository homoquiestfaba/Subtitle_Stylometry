Good work.

Hello.

I quit.

Someone was following me.

What do you mean? We have agreed on tomorrow morning.

I've already told you that I work alone, didn't I?

Oh, yes. You're right.

So, who was it?

What?

He knew about me.

Kawamura is going to meet the journalist tomorrow, understood?

I don't have the time to entrust someone else with this.

Hey, Benny...

If you knew anything else, you would tell me, right?

I've already told you everything!

I'll contact you again.

Rain!

We've found him!

Kawamura is going to meet the journalist tomorrow, understood?
I don't have the time to entrust someone else with this.

Hey, Benny...

If you knew anything else, you would tell me, right?

I've already told you everything!

I'm not hiding anything from you.

Anyways, after you've finished your job, vanish into thin air, understood?

You have retired, haven't you?

I'll contact you again.

Morning.

Good morning.

What's that?

My pacemaker. The same as yesterday.

I'm sorry. He's new here.

It's all right.

Yes.

Now I remember.

I've forgotten my keys at home.

And there's something I've put in the archive which I need now.

Could you lend me your key?

The archive?

Is there a problem with that?

No.

But could you please leave your bag here?

Yes.

Thank you.

I'll walk.

I need to move my body more.

Are you all right?

Put him down, put him down. Get an ambulance.

An ambulance...

That's great...

Rich places are always overflowing with money.

And I have to live in poverty.

I'm a police officer...

is anyone home?

If there's no one home, I'll come in myself.

I'm coming in!

That bastard... lived in such a big house...

When Kawamura left, where he went and which train he took.

They knew it.

They're trying to get the memory stick.

The content of the stick.

Kawamura didn't carry anything with him.

Have you searched through all his pockets?

Yes, all of them. There was nothing inside.

That's why they're all still searching for the stick.

Don't you understand?

Kawamura did not carry anything with him.

I couldn't get anything.

Last week, a known journalist contacted him.

If he knows anything, he'll spit it out.

A Japanese?

No, he's a foreigner, but his base is in Tokyo.

It seems, there are some bad rumors about Kawamura floating around.

Rumors? What kind of rumors?

They've told me I mustn't speak any further about it.

But he's dead anyways.

You know quite a lot.

Who are they?

You wouldn't believe me even if I told you.

They are from the CIA.

What?

You've heard me, right?

I'm very sorry.

I'd really have preferred to hear better news from you.

Yamamoto has already told me about it.

I see it the same way as he does.

We've done everything in our power.

Tell me: What was the reason for his death?

If more bureaucrats are going to die...

rumors and speculations will spread.

It were 3 people within the last 14 months.

If we don't find any clues soon...

Yamamoto will lose his faith in us.

You understand, don't you?

Yes, I understand.

I want to hear a solution for this problem from Yamamoto immediately.

We'll do everything so, that it will correspond with the expectations of the governor...

We'll do everything in our power.

I'm counting on you.

Thanks for your help.

Please visit me next time.

Oh, sure.

Please call Tattsuan.

[Natural Death]

This... is the lobby of the Grand Hotel, right?

Yes, their chandelier is very characteristic...

And this?

The Park View Hotel.

What? You...

Are you just loitering in hotels all day long?

I sometimes take my wife out for dinner.

I was really surprised how big their lobby is.

If it was me...

I would've been more surprised about the expensive food.

Isn't there a note written on the picture where it was taken?

Tonami is new in the records department...

That guy's always busy, even though he has the same hairdo as you...

It seems, he doesn't even have time for work.

Why don't young people trim their hair nowadays?

This is the latest trend, Tattsuan.

Even when you're standing still, it's moving like this.

It's as if it's floating.

I see.

Hey, what do you think?

What do you mean?

Shimizu died because food blocked his trachea.

Yes, exactly.

And Ishikawa...

took too many sleeping pills.

What do you want to tell me?

Shimizu locked himself up in his hotel room...

So he was alone that night, just like Ishikawa when he died.

Which means...

The suffocation and the overuse of the sleeping pills...

happened in the same night...

while they were in their hotel rooms all alone.

Yes, here's the first investigation department.

The executive vice-president wants to talk to you.

I'm going to him right now.

What do you think?

I don't know yet.

They've died a natural death.

What about him?

He had a heart attack.

The CCTV recorded this yesterday.

He's a member of Yamamoto's team.

Such an ugly Yakuza in our parking lot...

What did he want from him?

Yamamoto seems to think...

that we must have noticed something by now.

Within the last 14 months, 3 bureaucrats have died.

All of them died a natural death.

Well, even if you would tell me to hand you over the culprit...

They all were government officials, tamed by that guy.

What do you want to say with that?

If I think about it, I believe they were killed.

We have no proof for that and there are no witnesses.

That's why you're going to investigate.

You want me to go out and find evidence?

Somehow, I can't accept this.

Yamamoto is giving bribe money to some politicians...

Everyone knows that.

But we have to close our eyes anyhow.

But that's not all.

In the end, we police officers have to let them do as they please.

And sometimes we even have to protect them.

Executive vice-president...

Do you think all that can be called righteous?

It's called law.

That's nonsense!

Open your eyes.

There are situations where even our hands are tied.

When I was at interpol in London, there was a guy...

who falsely thought he could bend the law as he pleased.

He ran out out of luck as a cop, when it came to light.

And he started to think about it.

Just because of that he could...

save face in front of his dead father.

Bring me some evidence. As soon as possible.

I'm doing this business now since 35 years.

I'd like to say this is going to be easy, but...

Well... I'll try it.

I depend on you, Tattsuan.

Before all this is over...

you should be careful when you use your car.

Help.

They're trying to kill you.

This is related to your father.

They think your father...

gave something to you and because of that...

Don't get closer!

It's all right now.

My father said, he wanted to correct a mistake he made...

I understand.

It was right here.

Yes.

He got out of the train about here.

Here, yes?

Here?

Yes.

In which direction was he looking?

A bit more to the left.

Here.

Yes, I guess that's right.

Could you please show me the tape which was recorded from there?

Sure.

Erm... was it a famous person?

Who?

The person that died.

No, not really. Why?

Because this is the third time that police officers come here for investigation.

The third time?

Yes.

Well...

Could you please give me that tape?

It's my duty to give it to you.

Thank you.

I appreciate your efforts.

Hey, take turns!

Have you found the memory stick?

He anticipated us.

We've got taken by surprise, I'm afraid...

His daughter?

She's dead.

I don't care how you do it.

Go and search the memory stick.

Yes.

[Midori Kawamura]

Ladies and gentlemen...

After a break, we'll continue with...

a performance of Midori Kawamura. Please look forward to it.

Erm... excuse me please...

I'm Miyakawa from the Jazz Swing magazine.

That was a great performance.

Thank you very much.

The truth is, I want to...

write an article about Midori for the next issue.

I thought, maybe you could introduce me to her.

Please wait a moment.

Thank you very much.

That was superb!

Thanks.

Hey...

There's a journalist who wants to meet you.

This could be a good promotion for you.

Can't we do this after the performance?

But he said, he hasn't much time.

Hey, is he a nice person?

I'll call him.

Thank you for waiting. I've told her that you want to meet her.

This way, please.

Excuse me.

This is the journalist.

Midori Kawamura.

Nice to meet you.

Please try to finish this in 2 minutes.

The truth is, I'm not a journalist.

Your life is in danger. You should leave this place immediately.

What are you talking about?

Who are you?

Believe me. What I'm telling you...

No way! Sneaking in here and telling me lies...

Even if you tell me it's the truth...

We don't have time.

Erm... excuse me.

I'm a big fan of yours...

Could you please give me an autograph?

Let's go!

We need to hurry!

Can we get out from here?

I don't know!

He's here.

Hurry!

Hurry!

Who has sent you?

You tell me.

That's what I want to know.

Let's go.

Hey.

I've told you to come here...

I've told you not to get filmed by that camera.

I'm asking you to get away from there!

Let me go!

I've told you not to stand there.

Look!

Even though there's so much room...

Why do you need to stand there?

Why should I do what you tell me?

I don't even know who you are.

You're dragging me along all night...

Also, I don't like being ordered around!

You don't realize in what danger you are, do you?

I am trying to save you.

Like you've tried to save my sister?

Do you want to tell me that you've even tried to save my father?

If this is supposed to be a story, I've already read a lot of them.

So I already know the end of a story when I read its beginning.

What story?

Shall I tell you how this story will end?

I know it already.

You will be killed and that's it.

After everything that has happened, that wouldn't be strange.

Where are you going?

I'm hungry.

Won't you eat?

I usually don't eat in the morning.

What?

You've ordered it, even though you don't want to eat it?

If you go there to the right, there's a police box.

You can go there if you want.

Hey...

Where are you going?

What?

Hey, are you listening?

So, you're safe now.

You think you would've made it here even without me, right?

[We're on patrol to create a nice town where you can live safely. - Police box of Rokkenmachi.]

3 people in 14 months.

While they were in the position of power, their connection with the Yakuza came to light.

Aren't you reading too much into it?

That's my job.

So, does that memory stick really exist?

I don't know.

But, these three people...

I have a feeling that they were all killed by the same person.

What if there's a professional killer who makes the murders look like they were natural deaths...

If it looks like natural death and not murder, no one would investigate properly.

He must be really good. That man...

It's not impossible.

If this was the case, then the murderer....

must have been in the same car as Kawamura.

If there was such a guy...

isn't he just killing corrupt bureaucrats one after another?

Working overtime everyday. Just like us, huh?

[Natural death]

What happened to your little sister is very unfortunate.

I don't want to talk about my sister.

What you've done to that man...

Who are you?

Sometimes I get hired to save people....

So you've got hired to save me, too?

No, I thought it was necessary to save you.

Is this related to my father?

Yes, right.

I don't know anything about my father's work.

They don't think that.

Why don't you answer?

Pretend like it wouldn't ring.

What?

Do what I'm telling you.

Pretend that we're a couple.

That means, if I had been home too, I would've been killed like my sister.

So...

you're telling me, that the only reason...

I was saved is because I wasn't home that time?

If you don't want to waste your life now after it was saved...

you should open your eyes.

What do you mean?

Didn't you listen?

Yes, I did!

My sister was killed...

My father died three weeks before that. So I'm the next...

Stop it!

There are people...

who just want to kill you for money.

There's only one thing they care about:

Killing you and finishing their job. That's all.

They're waiting patiently for that one chance.

If that was my job, it would already be finished.

Earlier, there was a deliverer passing right next to you.

Do you know what he was delivering?

He was carrying a few cardboards.

You didn't even see such big things?

And do you remember those three construction workers?

One of them was holding a hammer.

He was looking at you all the time.

But because your head is just full of talking and yourself...

you didn't realize even that.

Do you even understand in what danger you are?

Are you sure you don't want to die?

Do you need my help?

Try it, then.

There are three men behind me getting closer.

If one of them was holding a knife, who would it be?

The man in the middle.

Come.

There's an amazing amount of CCTV all throughout Tokyo.

But they don't really know where we are.

They need about...

six hours to find our true whereabouts...

by reference to the images from the CCTV.

That's why we have to move on.

We need to take care not to take the same route twice.

The entrance of a subway...

A convenience store...

They're searching for us thoroughly...

Especially in places where we don't need to reveal our identity.

Churches...
