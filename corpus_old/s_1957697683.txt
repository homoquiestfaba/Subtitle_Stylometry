Initiating Hat Trick
AI targeting system.

Fox 1.

[missile firing]

Look out!

He's on my six!

[rapid beeping]

He's got a lock on me.

I got your six.

Hang on, I got him!

[alarm blaring]

Hat Trick isn't locking on.
I can't fire!

<i>You need to eject!</i>

-[alarm continues]
-I can't!

I'm locked in,
Hat Trick won't let me move!

I'm locked in.
I can't eject.

Eject! Eject!

Shit.


FBI!

Get down, get down.
FBI search warrant!

-Gun!
-[gunfire]

Cease fire, cease fire.

-Clear!
-Clear!

-Clear!
-Clear!

-All clear here.
-Clear.

Got a Kalashnikov over here.

Brass crucifixes.

Byzantine.

These guys are definitely
Pavdekshem, all right.

All right,
pack up everything.

Laptops, tools, phones,

documents, everything,
all right?

IB has four numbers showing up
on multiple intercepts:

2191.

I repeat: 2191.

They think it's an address
in the Tri-State Area.

Field office is
cross-referencing

all possible targets
with that number.

Turn this dump sideways,
all right, narrow it down.

You come across any
volatile materials,

we call it in.


Hey, this guy's still breathing.

All right, hey,
what's your name?

Where does it hurt?

I... am Roan.

I've been shot.

All right, he's been shot

in the shoulder and
in the arm, all right?

Give me towels, a shirt,
anything that I can

-cover the wound with.
-Let him bleed out.

What you patching him up for?

Look, the other one's dead,

I need him alive
long enough to talk.


Hurts, doesn't it?

That means it's working.

I'm doing you favor.

Now it's your turn.

2191. Talk to me.

Brag about it, all I care.

What's the target?
Where is it?


He's dead.

Hey, you look at me.

It's just you and me.

2191, where is it?

Rico!

Jesus.

Roan, that's enough
chemicals under there

to blow up this entire block.

-You killed my brother.
-Hey, he's dead

because you failed
to follow instructions.

We did what we had to do.

Now tell me what you're
doing with these chemicals.

What we had to do.

What does that mean?
Where is it?

These are for making an IED,

so where did you put it?

Where?

[plane soaring]

PA SYSTEM: <i>The white zone is...</i>

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

[indistinct chatter]

Good morning,
how are you doing?

Welcome, welcome.

Good morning,
welcome to Coastal.

Hello, hello, good morning.

Welcome aboard, can I help you
find your seat?

Yeah.

You are seated in 1B,
first class cabin.

-Through here--
-Excuse me, stewardess

-Yes, how can I help yo--
-I hate the window, okay?

I cannot sit by the window.
I am terrified of heights

and I get claustrophobic
if I can't get up

and move around like
I need to, and I--

-[deep breath]
-Let me see what I can do

about finding you
another seat.

-The aisle seat.
-Yes.

-The aisle.
-I hear you.

I-I-I'm...I'm sorry.

-No problem.
-Miss, is 1B on the aisle?

'Cause I don't mind
switching.

Oh, you're in first class.

Does it matter?

You would switch seats
with me?

-I'm happy to.
-Oh, my God, thank you!

My name is Larry,
I'm in 35A!

All right, all right,
enjoy yourself.

Thank you.
Thank you so much.

Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

Thank you.

Thank you, thank you.

Good morning, how are you?

Yes, welcome aboard.
Hello, you are in

2A and B,
just to the right there.

All right, finish turning
this place upside down.

We have two suspects here.

Is that it, or did
two more go out for takeout?

Put eyes on all four corners
of the building.

I want to know about everyone
coming in and out of here

at all times.

Rico.

We found these.

Aneroid altimeters.

They measure altitude.

Altitude?

So it's on an airplane.

You put it on an airplane,
didn't you, Roan?

And they have
my deepest sympathies.

Even the sinful deserves
some compassion.

It's those who do
no harm to others

in their iniquity
that I pity most.

Dante.

That's from Dante's <i>Inferno.</i>

What? How do you know?

I wrote my dissertation on it.

All right,
you see his face?

He thinks we're too stupid
to figure it out.

But we have an advantage.
You know this book.

Poem.

Think of any clues that can
help us solve this thing.

Symbols, numbers especially.

Okay, it's on a plane.

2191 isn't an address,

it's a flight number.

Could be originating from
any of the major airports

in the area,
find that flight.

Start with JFK,
LaGuardia, Newark.

If the bomb is
altitude-sensitive...

How did you get it on
the flight?

How did you get an IED

across the New York City TSA?

How did you pull
that one off, Roan?

You hear from weather central?

Weather center says
they're tracking a system

that'll have us locked down
for three hours

it's got enough
rain and wind in it.

What do you say we
get out of here now?

-Rock and roll?
-I wanna go.


Attention, passengers.
At this time,

the captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt sign.

We have a full flight
ahead of us, so please store

your carry-on items
under the seat in front of you

or in the overhead bin.

Take your seat
and fasten your seat belt.

Can I have your
attention, folks,

for a brief safety
demonstration.

So if you look at this in
the seatback in front of you,

this'll have all the information
you'll need.

There are two exits on this side
of the aircraft...

By the way, thank you
for giving up

your first-class seat
for that passenger.

You did him and I a big favor,

so thank you,
that's very kind of you.

Don't mention it.

When you've flown five hours
in cattle class

on a C-130 bound for Kabul,

nine hours in coach
is a welcome luxury.

-You're military?
-Army. EOD.

Well, retired.
Flying down to Santo Domingo

to walk my daughter
down the aisle.

Yeah, she always wanted
to get married on the beach,

so I'm not going
to disappoint her.

That's wonderful.

Congratulations, Mr. Garrett.

Thanks.

I'll be glad when we finally
land in Santo Domingo.

I just need a few drinks
on the beach,

then we can turn around
and head back to NYC.

-It's been a tough week.
-Sounds like a plan to me.

You set the device
with one of these.

Why would you have
these otherwise?

I've been thinking about it.

The numbers 3, 9, and 10

are the most prevalent
throughout <i>Inferno.</i>

The poem is in three parts.

There are nine circles of Hell.

The poem is 145 components.

Add those up, you get 10.

All right, so what did you
come up with?

Nothing.

None of the math adds up.

No matter how
I think it over.

But what if I'm overthinking it?

[snaps fingers]
Then it hit me.

Canto I, <i>The Divine Comedy.</i>

The poem begins
on March 24.

Are you kidding?
Today's date?

March 24, the year 1300.

All right, contact TSA JFK.

Have them run all
the fake IDs we found

through their facial
recognition.

I want to find out if our perps
were there today.

Copy that.

Flight attendants,
arm doors, cross check.

Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf
of Captain Wayne Curtis

and the entire crew,
welcome aboard

Coastal Air Flight 2191
with nonstop service

from New York
to Santo Domingo.

This is Special Agent Rico Dietz

with the FBI New York City
field office.

Put me through to Frank Wolfe.

This is an emergency.

FRANK WOLFE: Yeah, mm-hmm.

So have them write
the report again.

Let me get back to you.

This is Frank Wolfe.

Mr. Wolfe, this is
Special Agent Rico Dietz

at the JTTF New York office.

We have credible evidence
that there's an airliner

with an IED outbound
of New York today.

What are you talking about?

This morning, my team
conducted a raid on

a suspected terror cell
out of Queens.

What we found were bomb-making
materials and equipment.

FBI intel branch intercepted
multiple communications

with the numbers 2191.

At first, we thought
it was an address.

But now we believe
it's a flight number.

It's a Coastal Air flight
outbound JFK,

Flight 2191 to Santo Domingo.

Departure time 8:05 a.m.

8:05.

That flight takes off
from JFK in three minutes.

Contact JFK Tower.

They must ground
that flight immediately.

Tower, this is
Coastal 2-1-Niner-1.

Request taxi.

Coastal 2-1-Niner-1,
runway 3-1-left,

taxi left, Bravo Juliet.

Copy, Tower.

3-1-left.

Bravo and Juliet.

Coastal 2-1-Niner-1,

you're cleared
for takeoff.

Better get outta here.

Probably be the last plane
to make it up

before the storm
shuts down the Tri-State.

Music to my ears, Tower.

Flight attendants,
prepare for takeoff.

[phone rings]


JFK Tower, go ahead.

It's Frank Wolfe
at Eastern Regional,

with me on the line is
Special Agent Rico Dietz

of the FBI,
listen very carefully:

I need you to execute
an immediate takeoff abort

to Coastal Air Flight 2191.

That's 2-1-Niner-1.

There's an explosive device
onboard the plane.

We're heading to JFK now.

This is Dietz,
be advised

the device on that plane
is not yet armed.

But once it reaches 1,300 feet,

-we're gonna miss the abort.
-How do you know that?

This group has a thing
for numerology,

the 1,300 holds
significance for them.

Plus it fits the pattern
for this kind of attack.

But once it passes 1,300 feet,
we will miss the abort.

Now hurry.

Who has eyes on
Coastal 2191?

I do.

[phone clatters]

I just gave 2191 the all-clear
on runway 3-1-left.

-Coastal approach V1.
-2191 has reached

decision speed,
it's too late to abort.

That is 137 tons of aircraft
moving at V1 speed.

You can't just
hit the brakes on that.

No, the pilots have to continue
takeoff at this point.

If they don't, they're going
to overshoot the runway,

jeopardize the airplane
and the passengers.

WOLFE: <i>Alert 2191,</i>
<i>tell them what's happening.</i>

<i>They can turn around</i>
<i>and circle the airport</i>

<i>until they maintain</i>
<i>landing speed.</i>

What's going on?

Coastal 2191,
this is JFK Tower.

A little bit of a situation.

FBI has alerted us that there
may be an explosive device

on your aircraft.

Now just remain
at a safety altitude

of under 1,300 feet.

Tower, do you have
a location on the device?

<i>Coastal 2191, negative.</i>

You are to maintain
altitude below 1,300 feet.

Did she just say 1,300?

Tower, please repeat altitude.

Coastal 2191, I repeat,
maintain below 1,300.

The device isn't active
until it reaches 1,300,

at which point,
it will be armed.

Our current speed is 230 knots.

We'll reach 1,300
in 20 seconds.

Level off climb angle.

Copy that, Tower. 2-5-0.

2-5-0?
What've they got,

shorter buildings
in Long Island?

Tower, reducing thrust
for heading.

Already at 800 feet.

Coastal exiting traffic pattern.

900.

1,000 feet, reduce thrust.

Tower, request immediate
alternate vector

for return to JFK.

We've reached 1,200,
reduce thrust.

We're moving
as fast as possible.

Leveling to maintain below 13.

Maintaining 13.

Obstacle.

Obstacle approaching.

Radio broadcast tower!

Tower, Coastal increasing lift
along 250.

We have no choice or we crash.

[heavy breathing]

Oh, we're not gonna die!

We are not gonna die!

[both panting]

2191 surpassed 1,300.

Coastal 2191,

maintain until
further instructions.

Get Coastal
some new heading,

turn them around and bring them
back over that storm system

as best as you can.

Get Air Traffic on the line,

they need to know
what's going on.

<i>Sir, they've reached 1,300.</i>

Damn it!

This plan was set in
motion long ago.

You cannot stop us.

Why not?

What is it you want
with this plane?

To simply destroy evil.

Look to scripture.

It's all there if you
read the passages.

21, the number of sin.

Rebellion.

The disobedience of God.

91.

From Psalms 91.

Protection of prayer.

Don't be fooled.

For the Devil quotes
from Psalm 91

in the Book of Matthew.

2, 1, 9, 1.

The wicked must be punished.

Don't get in our way.

Dietz, I'm on with TSA.

Coastal runs out of
Terminal Four.

They just put in brand-new
credential authorization units.

The system verifies
every passenger.

It'll spot a fake on content.

But so far, every passenger
is verified.

They're still working
on the facial rec.

All right, tell them
to forward it to me here.

This will happen.

You will see.

We've armed the damn thing.

So...

we all right?

Flight crew, 7-700.

[heavy breathing]

wrong with the plane?

Everything's okay
with the plane.

It was just an air pocket.

What's an air pocket?

D-Do the pilots
know what that is?

Have they flown
through one before?

-Do they know what that is?
-Of course.

Captain Curtis has
over 7,000 logged hours

and First Officer Misch
was a lieutenant

in the Air Force
and is now a training pilot.

We're in good hands.

Oh, it's bad.

I know it is.

I know it is.
[deep breathing]

I'm here.
Why are we code 7-700?

What happened on the takeoff?

Military has informed us

that we do have
an active bomb on board.

We don't know who has it,

we don't know if it's
on one of the passengers,

on their person.

There's only a little bit
of information

available at this time.

Why aren't we landing?

We're not sure how
the bomb operates,

and we think it would be
a bigger danger if we landed

at this time, so we're not gonna
be informing the passengers.

Understood.

Thank you.

Marshal...

What's up with the 7-700?

Um, we have a situation where

ground control believes that
there is an explosive device

on the plane,
and we can't land

or we risk putting
a lot more lives in danger

than just our own,
and it's--

-Where is it?
-No idea.

They don't know where it is
or what it looks like.

-Any suspects?
-No, all they know

is that it's armed.

Okay, all right,
so we're--

we're looking for
a suspicious item

that could be...

that could be a detonator,
there's 285 people on board.

They all have carry-on,
personal items,

so just--let's just...

They might've used plastic
explosives to get it past TSA.

Um, I'll call the airline
and get a bagg--

baggage reconciliation report.

Maybe if we can connect
the bag that the bomb is in

to the passenger
that checked it...

Okay, okay, honey,
calm down, all right?

Now before you come
back out there,

take a look around
and see if there's

anything suspicious
in here, okay?

It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

Take it easy.

Nothing.

That storm is getting stronger.

We need to adjust course
heading to avoid the system.

It's gonna be shaky either way.

That storm is messing up
everything.

Everything.

Rico, we got that footage
you requested.

Wait, play that back.

This is Dietz.

We have a code yellow.

And how do we know this
bomb threat isn't a hoax?

Have they made their demands?

Did the group declare
their reasons

or intentions
behind the threat?

Bomb threats and bomb scares
are two very different things.

Most threats are fake,

made to instill fear,
intimidate.

Fewer than 7% of threats

turn up actual live
explosive material.

100% of scares involve
imminent risk from

an actual live
explosive device.

And bomb scares come with
little to no warning.

So, has the bomb scare been
reported to the DEN/ATSC?

I want all channels open
on the Domestic Events Network.

ATSC has been notified.

Put airport security and
emergency crews on standby.

And let JFK management
know we're bringing

this bird back down.

Alert TSA explosives teams

to the situation
and have them ready.

I want that plane on
the ground ASAP

with a military escort
to bring them home.

[phone rings]

We've got a problem.
One of our perps was

at JFK this morning.
Looks like he hacked

into the TSA's credential
authentication system

using one of those fake IDs
at Terminal Four.

TSA thinks it might've been
some kind of AI attack.

They've been blind all morning
and didn't even realize--

Wait, I don't understand, blind?

-Blind how?
-TSA's still trying

to figure that out.

They're afraid that the hack
reprogrammed their system

in order to let only specific
items go through.

And that's how they
got the device past the TSA.

That's the theory
at the moment.

Our suspect initiated tech,

made for sure the plane
took off, and then he left.

Their techs think it
might've been some kind of

military grade AI in order
to commandeer such an advanced

security system so quickly
and accurately.

Unfortunately, our tech
who initiated everything

died of a gunshot wound
less than an hour ago.

Another scan of the place where
we found him turned up nothing,

and the field office is
scouring for leads

and hellbent on red tape.

Hey, can I talk to you, please?

Someplace private, quiet?

In the galley?

Is there an Air Marshal
on board?

I can't disclose
that information.

Okay, then who's the guy
out there doing

random sweeps of
the overhead bins?

-What's he looking for?
-Sir, I-I appreciate your help

with the seat change earlier,
but I'm gonna have

-to ask you to take your seat.
-Is there a specific threat

against this aircraft?

Are we carrying something
onboard?

Sir, please take your seat.

You don't know where it is.

That's why he's sweeping
the bins

and I assume you
cleared the galley here.

Is everything all right
back here?

Yes, we're fine.
This passenger just

had some questions.

You can escort him back
to his seat for me?

-Gladly, let's go.
-You must be the Air Marshal.

Sir, please exit the galley.

Look, I can assist with
in-flight threat SOP

for a Code Bravo.

Sweep all the areas
that are normally missed

-by ground security checks--
-Who is this guy?

Army, 71st Ordnance Group.

I have EOD experience,
man, I can help.

Is that so?

I'll show you my VA card
if you want.

That won't be necessary.

I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

Please leave the galley, sir.


Where's he seated, Vanessa?

He was ticketed for first class,
but he switched seats

with another passenger
while boarding.

He had a first-class ticket
and he switched with

another passenger to
come back here in coach?

I'm gonna run a check
on both of them.

See if either raise
a red flag.

Ground,
this is Coastal 2-1-Niner-1.

35 miles out over
the Atlantic,

initiating emergency
fuel release

per earlier ATC request.

Can you go back
to your seat, sir?

The fasten seat belt sign is on.

Yeah, no problem.

Thank you.

This is Wolfe.

When was this?

Send it to me right now,

I wanna see
what they're seeing.

Thanks.

Dietz, it's Frank Wolfe.

TSA just got a passenger
background request on 2191.

Air Marshal up there
called it in.

FBI cross-checked notice,

they're gonna send me over
what they've got.

-They're CC'ing me on it.
-Did they say if there

was a specific disturbance
of any kind?

No, not yet.
Maybe the Air Marshal's

got a couple of people
that are-- Hang on.

"Taylor Garrett.

Chief Master Sergeant,
Army, 71st Ordnance Group."

Military.

"Larry Durante,
Scranton, Pennsylvania."

No, he's not military.

<i>Okay, send me those, will ya?</i>

No problem.
Where are you?

FBI cast a wide net.

Agents deployed for interviews
with military personnel,

contractors, subcontractors
active duty, retired, enlisted,

and officers all around
the country.

One of our agents got a POI over
at the Air National Guard Base

in West Hampton, New York.

We think he might
be part of this corrupt AI.

Figured I'd do a face to face.

Nothing came back on those
two guys, Garrett and Durante.

The one was with the 71st,
or he used to be.

Used to be.
What's that mean?

He's retired, but according
to his record,

he had a long and distinguished
military career.

So he's actually
able to help.

Yeah.

BANSHEE: Oh, look,
I made it to round two.

You're not the same two feds
I spoke to earlier?

I'm Special Agent Rico Dietz,
this is--

Special?

What makes you so special?

You know, those two guys
I talked to earlier?

They were special.

Bet your partner here
is special.

Tell you something, Rico.

If everybody's special,
then nobody is.

Little early
for a drink, no?

So you know why we're here?

Well, the guys earlier
wanted to talk to me

about a classified project.

What can you tell us
about your work

with artificial intelligence?

That it's classified.

"Project Hat Trick.

"Declassified,

"October 31, 2021.

Military Artificial
Intelligence Program."

Hat Trick.

Are you a hockey fan?

I don't name the projects.

And I prefer football.

Go Steelers.

Hey, I'm from Pittsburgh.

Is that where you're from?

Good for you.

All right, so why did they
name it Hat Trick?

I haven't worked on
this project in 10 months.

I am not the person
you're looking for.

Look, I know,
and you know,

you're probably not our guy.

But we came all the way
out here.

Gotta make it worth
the taxpayers' money.

Just answer three questions
and we'll be on our way.

Okay, you wanna know why
it's called Hat Trick?

The three most difficult points
of functionality in AI:

computing power, trust deficit,
and human level performance.

The primary program objective
was to optimize

those three points
for air combat,

build a faster,
smarter-thinking aircraft

while still remaining
subservient to the pilot.

So how did it go?


How did it go?

Goddamn Volos shot down
a great pilot

and a very good friend of mine.

Have you ever called
a friend's mother,

gave her the single most
horrific piece of news

that she will ever hear?

Volos? You mean
the Volodrezjkans?

BANSHEE: About 10 months ago,
DeMarcus and I

were on a sortie providing
air support

to rebel fighters
on the ground

trying to overthrow
that son of a bitch

they got in charge over there.

Their so-called president,

Artosk.

The man is a sadist,
a butcher.

We call him
the Volodrezjkan Viper.

Our planes had
the Hat Trick tech installed.

When it was initiated,

Demon's plane
essentially froze up.

There was a glitch,

and he was shot down
by the Volodrezjkan Air Force.

Because my AI failed.

<i>Hang on, I got him!</i>

I told them it wasn't
quite ready yet.

I told them
it needed more testing.

You think the Pentagon
gave a damn?

And now I've been butting heads

with their frickin'
advisory board

for the last year trying
to get them to keep

searching for the wreckage
of Demon's plane.

At least figure out if
the tech burnt up,

or if it was intercepted

somewhere on
the coastal mountain range.

what the Pentagon says?

"Oh, Project Hat Trick
remains top priority."

Yeah, it's such a top priority,
they can't even find it.

Bastards are fumbling
around in the dark

without guys like
me and Demon.

This morning,
Coastal Air Flight 2191

was targeted by a group
of right-wing radicals.

They go by the name
Pavdekshem.

They were able to get
an IED aboard this flight.

It's in the air right now.

These radicals
that we're up against,

they were exiled from
their home country.

And we have very credible proof
that they're hiding out

in Volodrezjka.

They're hiding in Volodrezjka?

Yes.

How they actually got and hacked
the TSA security clearance

was through military grade
artificial intelligence.

Major, is that tech yours?

God, I hope not.

Miss, please,
we need your help.

Hundreds of lives
hang in the balance.

Mr. Garrett.

Okay, you got me.

Come with me.

So what is this,
you gonna arrest me now?

Mr. Garrett, Tony Wilkes,
Air Marshal.

So he's not arresting me.

Look, you need to
understand my position.

We've been notified that there's
an item on board.

It's my duty
to protect everyone,

and everyone is a suspect.

Especially someone who's willing
to help without being asked

and has demonstrated
an awareness of

internal airline protocols
in situations such as this.

Look, when you put it that way,
it does sound suspicious.

Well, with all that aside,
was I right?

Your experience and expertise

in this type of situation
would help a lot right now.

Let's find this thing.


What is it?
What's wrong?

Nothing, I'll just feel better
once we find this IED.

Rough turbulence can
sometimes set it off

if it's sensitive enough.


Okay, look,
if you locate the IED,

don't move it, don't touch it.

Just leave it be.

What's an IED?

It's a device made up
of otherwise harmless items,

but expertly combined to inflict
as much damage as possible.

Let's go.

I wanna check back here.

Augh!


Wow, Major Banning.

Captain, we have
a situation.

This is the FBI.

Special Agent Dietz,
Agent Smith.

-What's going on?
-They've just informed me

that there's an active bomb
threat on a commercial airliner.

And the terror group responsible

used military grade AI
to get past TSA.

You're serious?

There's more.

This group has ties to Volo.

Where did this happen?

JFK Airport.

TSA reports that the breach
was swift and accurate.

So this AI,
it's designed to go in jets?

-Like to fly them?
-Pilots fly.

The AI must remain subordinate
to the pilot.

If you remove pilots
from the equation,

you're no longer creating a
superior fighting force of men.

You're building heavily armed
war machines running on software

too unpredictable to be
relied upon for combat yet.

Why is it so unpredictable?

The AI algorithms work
in simulated combat scenarios.

We have yet to fully develop
what would happen

in real world
combat scenarios.

So the computer brain acts more
like a wingman than a pilot.

And don't let anybody
tell you otherwise.

A commercial airliner
has live ordnance on it.

So I assume the SOP is
to bring it back to JFK?

That's correct.

Fuel dumping over
the Atlantic.

We can't risk it going to
a lower elevation airport

and endangering other lives.

SOP would also dictate
it requires a military escort

to return it to origin.

Are you commandeering orders

that have yet
to be assigned?

Just call it thinking ahead.

NORAD is bound to issue
the order any minute.

Our location makes us
the most likely to get it.

We might as well accept
in advance.

Okay.

<i>This is Banshee and Smoke,</i>
<i>we're in the air.</i>

<i>Stay alert for enemy bogeys.</i>

<i>Coastal 2-1-Niner-1,</i>
<i>be advised you'll be joined by</i>

<i>military escort</i>
<i>to bring you in.</i>

<i>ETA 10 minutes</i>
<i>due to weather.</i>

Tower, this is Coastal.
Copy that.

Storm is messing
everything up.

Both cabins have been
swept for the IED.

We haven't checked

the passengers' carry-ons,
obviously.

We've got about 10 minutes left
on this fuel dump

before we reach
the approved landing weight.

Then...

Then we'll get the passengers
ready for descent.

They're asking
a lot of questions already.

They can wait 10 more minutes
until we check

the baggage compartment
down below.

The Air Marshal
and one of the passengers

has agreed to go look for it.

What, are you kidding?

We can't allow a passenger
to go down there.

His name is Taylor Garrett.

He's a retired army sergeant

who used to work on
these type of IEDs.

So he has the skills
and the training

to build something like this.

Which means he has a training

and he knows how to disarm
something like this.

Look, Air Marshal Wilkes
has checked with TSA.

He's clean, and...

he's the best and only expert
we have right now.

Captain,
it's your decision.

But if we can find this thing
before we land,

we can give TSA a head start
on dealing with it.

All right, but I want those
passengers back in their seats

by initial descent.

We've only got 10 minutes.

Understood.

-What's the verdict?
-You can both go

down to baggage and sweep
the area together, but hurry.

We only have about
nine minutes.

I'll have you hold onto this.

Follow me.

Excuse me, I'm trying
to get to the restroom.

I'm trying to get
to the restroom--

If I don't use it,
I'ma use it on myself, okay?

Get off of me.

Down the hatch.

Hey, we'll find it.

Uh, $60 extra and
I can't use the bathroom?

I'm sorry, this one's
out of order.

The toilet not
flushing properly...

That's fine, I-- look...

<i>Coastal Air,</i>
<i>this is Cobra 1.</i>

We're here to help bring you
down safe and sound.

Cobra 1, this is Coastal.

You don't know how happy I am
to hear that.

Hey, excuse me,
flight attendant.

Yes, sir?

Uh, is there problem?

Pilots have not said anything.

And maybe you could tell us
what's happening.

[all murmuring]

Uh, I have no other
information.

I only know what
you know at this time.

-Oh, come on!
-Please, please--

I'm sorry, look, I'll go
ask the flight deck

for an update
as soon as possible.

I want to know
as badly as you.

[murmuring continues]

Please. Please.

Cobra 2, I've got a pair
of bogeys on approach

coming in 0-8-0,
westbound.

Affirmative. Due west.

19 miles out.

-[jet whirring]
-Those are fighter jets!

What's going on?

It's freezing down here.

Yeah, well,
if we're gonna be

moving these bags around,

we'll break out
in a sweat.

They must have made a killing
overweight bag fees today.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is that?
What'd you just pick up?

You smell that?

It's acetone.

I smell it now.

Do not drop that bag.

All right, we're gonna
set this down real easy, okay?

Nice and easy.
Very gentle.

That's triacetone triperoxide
in the detonator.

TATP? That's the same shit
that the shoe bomber used.

Yeah, except there's
a lot more of it in here.

Hey, this bag didn't
go through security.

There's no baggage
check tag on here.

That's a clue.

All right.

Okay.

I don't see any wires or pins.

I think it's safe to open.

I need something sharp,
I'm gonna cut through this bag.

The zippers could be rigged.

Never leave home without 'em.

Thatta boy,
always be prepared.

We got a barometric IED.

It's a live weapon.

Okay...

we need to pile up
these suitcases and bags.

Form a kind of barricade
to, you know,

absorb some-- if something
goes horribly wrong.

Let's start stacking these up.

Very carefully.

Look, just be careful
going near the IED.

Don't touch anything.

Shouldn't we move this
to an LRBL?

No, not right now,
a sudden movement

could make it detonate.

We'll try moving it to
a least risk bomb location

once I figure out what
we're dealing with.

Let's just hope this
is the only one onboard.


Let's just stack
these carefully.

We can't have them collapsing
down on top of the IED.

Otherwise, it's goodnight.

So, Vanessa, we have the IED.

<i>It's in baggage</i>
<i>and it's armed.</i>

-Can we disarm it?
-Can you disarm it?

-This is garbage, man.
-Where are we supposed to go?

I'm sorry, please, there's more
lavatories in the back.

This one's out of order
right now, okay?

Stand by.

We're about to find out.

Careful.

Okay, the IED is armed

with an Aneroid Altimeter.

It's detecting changes
in altitude.

That definitely armed the thing.

Mother of Satan.

Don't.

It's very sensitive
to impact infriction.

There's enough in here
to tear the plane apart.

But I already moved it.

Well, now that
the bag is open,

it's more sensitive to
pressure changes and abrasion.

Just stay there.

All right,
there's a signal box.

A signal box?

What kind of signal
is it emitting?

No, it's not emitting.

It's detecting signals.

They set it up as
a trigger for the IED.

If that's the trigger,
where's the signal?

It's reading electrical signals

from LVDT and RVDT sensors.

I saw this all the time
in Kabul

on our patrol
in Helmand Province.

Wh-What are the sensors?

They're electromechanical
transducers.

They convert rectilinear
motion of objects

into electrical signals.

Aircrafts like this
are full of them.

Why? What for?

Well, they make sure that
the flight controls,

all the systems are
operating properly.

So that box, it detects
electrical signals?

Yes.

Well, if the plane
hasn't blown up,

it hasn't gotten
the right signal, right?

That's correct.

So what signal
is it waiting for?

We're at landing weight.
Vanessa, get them back

to their seats.
We're gonna land.

Taylor, we're getting ready
to begin our descent.

<i>You and Wolfe need</i>
<i>to get back up here, copy?</i>

Now wait a minute.

You said that these sensors
are all over the plane.

-Right?
-Yeah, y--

And they make sure
that the flight controls

and the mechanical structures
are working, right?

Yeah, yoke, foot pedals,
thrust levers, you name it.

What parts of the plane with
these sensors aren't being used?

No, they're all in use.

Since this thing
has become active.

It's the landing gear.
It's gotta be the landing gear.

The landing gear is
a mechanical structure

-and has those sensors?
-Yes.

There's a sensor in
the nose wheel steering column.

The landing gear was retracted
when the IED was armed.

We can't land the plane.

Jesus Christ.

Vanessa. Vanessa,
do not land this plane.

Do not land the plane.

<i>We have the IED</i>
<i>but it's set to explode</i>

<i>when you extend</i>
<i>the landing gear.</i>

<i>You cannot land.</i>
<i>Do not land.</i>

Engines are down
to fuel reserves.

Tower,
this is Coastal 2-1-Niner-1.

The IED has been located

in the baggage compartment
of our aircraft.

We are unable to land.

Repeat, we are unable to land.

Coastal 2-1-Niner-1,
you found the device

but you're unable to descend?

They found it.
Why can't they land?

Coastal, copy that.
Be advised

<i>that you are currently</i>
<i>heading into</i>

<i>a pretty nasty weather pattern</i>

<i>and we'll try to swing</i>
<i>you around</i>

<i>-as best we can, but--</i>
-Copy that.

We are unable to descend
because...

because the bomb is somehow
wired to the landing gear.

Jesus.

Okay, stand by for alternate
heading for the storm.

I gotta tell you,

it's a pretty major system.

-[thunder rumbling]
-Whoa!

Tony, don't move.


Oh, no...


What the hell was that?

Taylor? Taylor, is everything
all right down there?

Tony...

Tony!

<i>Taylor, what happened?</i>

Remote proximity choice.

What bags did you bastards
put it in?

Taylor, the storm
is coming closer.

Oh, Jesus.

All right.

All right.

Here we go.

Okay.


-[joysticks clattering]
-ATC,

any update on that
alternative route?

We're going right for the storm.

<i>It's a negative, Coastal.</i>

<i>You'll lose too much fuel</i>
<i>going around.</i>

<i>You're gonna have</i>
<i>to fly through.</i>

[clattering continues]

You should probably get back.

[thunder continues]


[rapid beeping]

What the hell...
this damn turbulence!

[beeping continues]

[alarm blares]

[beeping intensifies]

[beeping continues]

[beeping stops]

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª


Holy shit.

Taylor? Taylor, are you there?

Yeah, I'm okay.

I'm still here.

How'd it go?
Is it still active?

We're not out of the woods yet.

We're not-- Why...

Would you give me
that, please?

<i>This is Captain Curtis.</i>

<i>What's going on down there?</i>

Look, whoever did this

expected every move
we were gonna make.

They stuck remote charges
in the other passengers' bags

'cause they knew we would
surround the device with luggage

to soften the blow
in case it went off.

<i>So they knew our procedures</i>

<i>and they're using them</i>
<i>against us?</i>

Yeah, the IED sent
a remote beacon

that armed the charges
in the other bags.

Is that device disabled now?

I mean, we have to land
this plane.

<i>Look, we can't land yet.</i>

Listen, we dumped our fuel.

What we're flying on now
is reserves,

which means we've only got
30 minutes tops.

Captain, you're carrying TATP.

It's acetone peroxide.

It's been taped up tight
in sealed containers,

making it extremely unstable,

sensitive to both
shock and friction,

the two things you're gonna get
when you try to touch down.

<i>The slightest nudge might</i>
<i>detonate them.</i>

We lost Wilkes.

What? What happened?

When the IED sent
the remote beacon to arm

the charges in the other bags,

Tony caught one,

prevented it
from falling on the IED.

Shielded it with his own body.

He saved the plane.

The man went out a hero.

<i>Listen, Taylor, I've been</i>
<i>flying for eight years.</i>

<i>I think I can handle</i>
<i>a smooth landing.</i>

Yeah, and I've been dealing
with this stuff for 12.

This has nothing to do with
your landing abilities.

We're gonna have
to land in the storm.

Even if the weather clears,
it's windy

and the runway is wet.

You'll need to descend faster
than five feet per second

just to stop hydroplaning.

He's right,
we'd have to execute

a positive landing
at that rate of speed.

<i>Look, we don't know what</i>
<i>failsafes these terrorists</i>

<i>have installed elsewhere</i>
<i>in the plane,</i>

<i>but until we can do</i>
<i>a scan of the entire aircraft</i>

<i>we have to assume</i>
<i>it's not safe to land.</i>

Sophie, what's AWC saying?

Advisory's still in effect
for the Tri-State area

until 8:30 p.m.

Okay, so what do you
suggest we do?

Look, we don't have the luxury
of a proper disposal.

I have to throw it out of
the plane over the ocean.

But first we're gonna
shield it.

Better let JFK know
what's going on.

<i>Yeah, I'll need to</i>
<i>transfer the IED</i>

<i>to one of these</i>
<i>hard shell suitcases.</i>


-Vanessa?
-I'm sorry.

I'm--I'll be all right.

I hate to say it,

but were we wrong
to trust Taylor?

No, he was vetted by ATC

and he put his life at risk
to go down there.

If he wanted to
blow up the plane,

he would've done it already.

Besides, none of us know
how to defuse a bomb.

You're right.

-Do you need a minute?
-No, sorry.

I'm--I'm all right.

Taylor, I can show you
where the designated

LRVL is on the plane.

There is a cabin closet
in the bulkhead divider

at the rear galley.

No, look, we can't
take that risk.

I'll have to pack it up
and toss it out down here.

Tower, this is
Coastal 2-1-Niner-1.

<i>The explosive device</i>
<i>has been defused.</i>

<i>However, it is too unstable</i>
<i>to land at this time.</i>

We are going to try to dispose
of the device in midair.

Do you copy?

Coastal, what is your
current fuel level?

Did they disable it?

Reroute all your planes

for vertical and horizontal
separation.

They found the device
and disabled it,

but they don't know if the bomb

could be reactivated
on landing.

So what are they going to do?

They're gonna drop them
from the plane.

Better alert the Coast Guard.

Have them clear all the ships
and vessels from the area.

Yeah, this'll work.

Coastal 2-1-Niner-1, I have
an unidentified aircraft

moving your way extremely fast
along heading 1-2-5.

Cobra 2, I've got
an unidentified aircraft

approaching at 1-2-5.
You seein' this?

I've got that same bogey
coming in real hot

on 1-2-5, 18 miles.

What is it doing here?

[MiG roaring]

Cobra 2, bogey,
bandit moving westbound.

Appears he's on his own.

Copy, Cobra 1.
Proceeding as threat hostile.

Threat hostile!

Cobra 2, arm hot.

Tower, this is
Coastal 2-1-Niner-1.

Just got a visual
on that bogey from earlier.

Cobra 2.
Fox 1!

Cobra 2, he's on me.

Cobra 2,
MiG staying on me.

The guy won't let me out
of the defensive.

[power surge, beeping]

Cobra 2, Fox 3!


Yes! Splash one!

Splash one! Whooo!

Cobra 2, return to escort
immediately.

Copy that.

That was a Volodrezjkan MiG.

Our bogey was buzzing
an American airliner?

We may be over
international waters,

but he's a long way
from the Bahamas.

<i>Coastal Air,</i>
<i>this is Cobra 1.</i>

<i>We just encountered</i>
<i>a lone enemy bogey</i>

<i>entering our airspace.</i>

<i>Do you have any further</i>
<i>information as to the nature</i>

<i>of the threat against</i>
<i>your aircraft?</i>

This is Coastal 2-1-Niner-1,

please be advised,
we have been given

no further information about
the threat at this time.

<i>No dignitaries or important</i>
<i>individuals onboard</i>

<i>who may be of interest</i>
<i>to enemy combatants?</i>

Cobra 1, we have
nothing that would be

of interest on the vessel.

No persons of interest.

Maybe... the bomb?

Hey, nobody goes
in there, all right?

It's out of order,
you got me?

-Yeah.
-[grumbling]

[overlapping arguing]

Look, I need you
to get me the crash axe,

fire gloves, fire blankets,
goggles and duct tape.

Fire gloves, blankets, goggles,
and duct tape are all in

-forward emergency stowage.
-First class.

Mm-hmm, and the crash axe

is in the flight deck,
I'll go get it.

All right.

How's it going out there?

Passengers are getting angry,
they're scared,

and to be honest,
I don't blame them.

You have the controls.

Passengers, this is your
Captain Wayne Curtis.

<i>It is my duty to inform you</i>

<i>that we have</i>
<i>an emergency situation.</i>

<i>There has been a bomb scare</i>
<i>against this aircraft</i>

<i>and we are circling</i>
<i>over the Atlantic</i>

<i>before we return to JFK.</i>

<i>Emergency crews will be</i>
<i>canvassing the aircraft,</i>

<i>at which time we will exit</i>
<i>in an orderly fashion.</i>

<i>You may have noticed the F-16s.</i>

<i>We have been given</i>
<i>a military escort</i>

<i>due to the bomb threat</i>
<i>against this aircraft.</i>

<i>We will return to JFK</i>
<i>and exit the aircraft</i>

<i>in an orderly fashion.</i>

No! No!

No! No! No no no no!

Let me in! Let me in!

Let me in!

-[banging on door]
-Let me in!

Come on! Let me in!

Let me in! Let me in!

Come on, let me in!

Let me in! Come on!

No! Let me in!

Let me in!
Come on, come on!

[overlapping shouting]

-They're gonna kill us--
-It's okay, my friend!

Okay, okay, stay calm,
my friend, okay?

I got you, okay?

Okay? Stay calm.

The pilot said to
st-- stay calm, okay?

The pilot is gonna kill us!
The pilot is gonna kill us!

The pilot said to stay calm.

The pilot is
gonna kill us!

The pilot is gonna kill us!

We gotta stop 'em!
They're gonna kill us!

They're gonna kill us!
They're gonna kill all of us!

Get off of me!
Get off of me!

-Okay, stay calm.
-All right, hold him.

[overlapping shouting]

-Hold him, hold him!
-Get off of me!

-It's all right!
-They're gonna kill us!

You're gonna let 'em kill us!
You're gonna let 'em kill us!

[shouting continues]

They've got him back
from the door.

It's okay. It's okay.

They're gonna kill us all!

Okay, calm down,
calm down!

I'm fine, really.
I am, I am, I just...

I just lost--I lost my head
for a second.

But I'm fine now, I am.

I know, I know.
I just want to make sure you

and all the other passengers
feel safe, okay?

You can go ahead
and take your seat, sir.

Fasten your seat belt,
thank you so much for your help.

-Is he going to be all right?
-Yes.

I'ma be fine soon as
he done feeling me up.

Hey.

Thanks for stepping up
to help me.

Taylor.

I'm Peter.

Just goes to show,

you never know where
the threat is coming from.

Stewardess,
you have to untie me.

You can't keep me here.
I'm a paying customer.

I know my rights.

That's mine.

That's mine.

It's clear, nothing here.

Who gave you the right
to just go through my stuff?

He's not our guy.

Hey!

I wanna see some credentials!

Credentials!

I want to see 'em!

[deep breathing]

WOLFE: Okay, we'll be waiting
on that email.

Two minutes, right?

Thanks.

Dietz, Wolfe.
Coastal Air is sending over

the passenger manifest
for 2191.

Send the manifest
to the field office.

When it arrives,
they'll cross-ref for flags.

Cobra 2, let's deploy left.

Meet 'em halfway.

Go burners.

Captain, that's two more
bogeys on approach.

Jesus, who are they?
What do they want?

Taylor, our military escort
just broke off to engage

more fighters. Whatever
you're doing, do it fast.

What are you doing down here?
It's not safe, go back up.

It's not safe for anyone
onboard, so just let me

help you. What are you doing,
why you chopping up suitcases?

It's mine.
It's got Kevlar panels.

It was a gift from
the guys in my unit.

Okay, look, help me quick
and then go back up.

All right, here.

Get the tape.

Tape it around my torso.

This is a makeshift blast suit,

it's not much,
but it's all I got.

-There you go, yep.
-Tight? Okay.

Tower, this is
Coastal 2-1-Niner-1.

F-16s engaging bogeys on
two more aircraft.

I repeat, F-16s engaging bogeys
on two more aircraft.

-Okay, we good?
-Yeah.

-All right, now go back up.
-Okay.

Hey, stay on walkie.
I'll let you know

when I'm at
the compartment door.

And the captain needs to disarm
the outer door.

Okay, he's got us
at a low enough altitude

-for depressurization.
-Okay.

Oh, God.

[rapid gunfire]

Cobra 2,
bandits heading 3-2-0.

I'm on MiG 1.

Copy 1, I'm on 2.

Cobra 2,
bogey bandits breaking.

-Stay on MiG 2.
-I'm on him!


Did you hear from
the field office?

Wolfe, we got a hit, we're
about to get on the chopper.

<i>Patch us through</i>
<i>to the plane.</i>

We know we have to keep
the ATC line open.

Try the cell numbers of
the flight crew on the manifest.

[cell phone ringing]

Hello, this is Vanessa Jensen.

Miss Jensen, this is
Special Agent Rico Dietz

of the FBI JTTF.

<i>We received a manifest</i>
<i>from Coastal Air.</i>

We had our office cross
reference every name on here.

<i>Peter Guren.</i>

He's part of an international
hacktivist collective

called Peanut Ravioli.

They go after
foreign governments,

religious groups, politicians,
anyone they deem corrupt.

He's on our plane?
Do you have a photo of him?

I'll text it to you now.

Cobra 2, he's on you.

Break away, evade.

I'll come up from behind.

They got us on
the defensive!

Cobra 2...

Cobra 2, they're going
for 2-1-Niner-1.

They're firing on us!

[all screaming]

Gotcha!

MiG 1, splash!

There's nobody in it.

The Hat Trick AI targeting
system didn't burn up.

It was stolen.

<i>That's our tech!</i>

Cobra 1,
bandit 2 targeting Coastal.

Cobra 1, R-33's away,
on approach!

Oh, my God.
It's gonna hit that plane.

<i>There's nothing they can do,</i>
<i>they're just sitting ducks!</i>

Banshee...

<i>Finish this fight.</i>

Cobra 2?

<i>[Smoke screaming]</i>

Cobra 2!


Come on, Garrett,
get this thing off the plane!

-No, taken!
-Is that so, Pete?

Wanna tell me what you're doing
with a laptop in the lavatory?

-No, no...
-This is Piotr Gurin.

He look familiar to you?

Who sent you this?

-FBI?
-You're a suspect now.

Probably their only suspect.

You think I'm the one

who put bomb on plane?

No, I'm not trying
to blow up plane.

I need plane to get out
of New York.

-It is not safe for me there.
-Why? FBI closing in on you?

I need to get out of city.

Lay low, Dominican Republic.

Well, we are headed
back to JFK now.

I'm going to hold on to this,
and the FBI will deal with it

-when we get there.
-No, please, no, please.

I need that, please.

The plane, it didn't get
to cruising altitude.

No WiFi, I need to use VPN.

I can't do that.

No, he has people.

He has people.

They are hunting us
one by one.

What are you talking about?

I am Volodrezjkan.

The Artosk regime
is coming after me,

and he has no problem
blowing up plane

full of Americans to do it.

Especially since your government
got involved with the rebels

who are fighting against him.

Why would he be after you?

I am a good guy.

I can prove it.
I can prove it.

Artosk regime turned
Volodrezjka into

surveillance state,
but we turned it against him.

We are going to bring down
his regime in disgrace.

Look, none of this is
making sense to me.

You can explain it
to the FBI when we land.

No, please, please!

No, please,
I can't let you take it.

I have emails,
I have documents,

I have evidence
against him, okay?

Before he kills us!

He will kill us all,
do you understand?

I've had enough unruly
passengers for one flight.

-You're taking your seat, sir!
-Please, please!

<i>Coastal Air,</i>
<i>this is Cobra 1.</i>

<i>We lost Cobra 2.</i>

<i>I repeat, Cobra 2</i>

<i>Be advised,</i>
<i>begin your descent ASAP.</i>

<i>These jets are unmanned.</i>

<i>AI control, Hat Trick.</i>

<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>they're capable of.</i>

I thought that AI was lost?

<i>Well, they found it.</i>

Coastal, there are more
of them coming.

Two more MiGs.
I repeat, begin your descent.

Coastal, you're under attack.

-Incoming MiG!
-We see it.

Give me the flight deck,
Captain.

I can outmaneuver these guys.

It's all yours, Lieutenant.

Coastal, the MiG
is coming right for you

at heading 0-9-0!

Cobra 1, seeing bandit.

MiG-29...

0-5-0.

50.

Angels 10.

Coastal, here comes MiG 1.

I'm on him, go evasive.

Cobra 1, enemy MiG attempting
collision with our aircraft.

Vanessa, tell the captain
to open the hatch.

Captain, disarm the baggage
compartment door.

You're good to go.

Fox 1.

Fox 2.

Splash one MiG.

Do you see he's circling?

MiG 2 circling back.

On collision heading...

Aaah!

Sayonara, you son of a bitch.


[all screaming]

Oh, God, oh, God!

[screaming continues]

We have to land the plane.

I don't know how to fly a plane!

Look, I don't either.
We don't have a choice,

unless you wanna get on the PA
and find out if we got

any pilots onboard as we go
screaming into the Atlantic.

Come on!

Coastal, do you copy?

This is Ground, come in.

Coastal, do you copy?

Nothing, I'm getting
nothing from the plane.

What? You can't hail 2191
on the radio?

No.

Coastal 2191, do you copy?

Are you there?
Do you read me?

Are you there?

[muttering indistinctly]

The pilots are dead!

It's them,
they're on the way in!

-Take the phone.
-Hello?

We're bringing it in
for a landing.

We're landing.

What? You're what?

Okay, okay, listen closely,
I'll steer you in.

You're gonna be
coming in on runway 13R--

Whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't know
what any of that means.

Okay, okay, okay.

Pay close attention
and do not deviate.

You're going to be coming in
slowly on runway 13R.

Give me that,
I'll bring them in.

This is Janis,
your ATC supervisor

Listen very carefully
to every word.

<i>Now, the system switched</i>
<i>to autopilot because</i>

<i>of all the rain</i>
<i>from the runway</i>

<i>and I'm gonna need</i>
<i>your help steering her in.</i>

I got you, ATC.

My headset isn't working.

Now the water from the rain
is not going to make it easy,

so I don't know how much
autopilot is going to work.

Listen very carefully,
I'm gonna need your help

to steer her in.

Where's the landing gear?

I can't find the switch!

I think the comms are down!

All right, we're going in
without wheels.

BANSHEE: <i>The switch</i>
<i>for the landing gear</i>

<i>is directly above your head!</i>

<i>I repeat, directly</i>
<i>above your head!</i>

Who is that?

I got the comm to work.

Coastal,
flip that switch now!

All right, listen carefully.

Increase speed.

Reach for that throttle
by your side.

They're coming in too fast.

-Are you looking at the screen?
-Reach for that throttle,

increase the speed.

Now thrust it forward
and bring the nose down.

-[alarm blaring]
-Okay, uh, yeah,

we're getting some
kind of a sound,

a very bad sound,
some kind of alarm going.

You're doing it on purpose.

You're gonna crash the plane!

What did you s--
Give me that phone!

[all shouting]

You're under arrest.

No! Let it crash!

Let 'em all crash!

Oh, my God!

I'm not ready for this.


Okay, we can do this

We're gonna land this plane!

[exhales, laughs]


We did it.

We did it,
we landed the plane.


Oh my-- Holy...

We did it, we did it.

It's okay, it's okay.

This is yours.

Thank you.

I've just been debriefed
by Mr. Gurin here.

He's told me why
the aircraft was targeted.

We're going to place him under
federal protected custody

so that way he can meet
with the State Department.

Artosk labeled our group
as enemy of state.

They got the Pavdekshem
to bomb the plane.

For what?

Plausible deniability?

Yes, of course.

Blame us for the crime
in front of the whole world

and then tell Pavdekshem
they are free from exile

if they do dirty work,
like bomb airline carrier.

But when it didn't work

he got his military drones
to attack.

You're all free to go.

We're gonna put him on a flight
to DC within the hour.

Maybe put him
on a train this time.

[all chuckling]

I feel like I wanna barf.

So, what are your plans
for the night?


Why?

What do you have in mind?

Want to go to a wedding?

Are you kidding me?
Go on another flight?

Hey there.

You two need a lift?

I don't think we'll fly
this one.

So what do you think?

Sure, why not?

There's some good flying
you guys did up there.

Well, we had some help.

We're natural born pilots,
I guess.

That's what we do.

Pilots fly.
