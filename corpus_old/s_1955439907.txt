-All fucking American!


Swimmers rule!


-The best fucking swim
team in the country.

-Oh, yeah.

-[inaudible] kicks ass.

-Yes!

-Today we became All-American!

-Yeah.

-Whoo!

-Whoo!

Yeah!

TERRY: This motherfucker
pulls it out

of his ass to beat
that loser, Holtzapfel.

Yeah!

-Is my best friend.


Why don't you get a little
more emotional, man.

-Fuck you, man.

He's my best friend.

-My best friend.

Aww, cute.

-Everybody get your beers up.

Man, I'm going to
toast to him right now.

Here it is.


-Denied.

[beer bottle breaking]

[police sirens]

TERRY: Kyle, we got cops!

Kyle!

KYLE SULLIVAN: Whoo!

What's up?

Good move, dick-wad!

You hit the fucking cop car.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Whoo!

We've got cops.

They're coming up here, too.

They ain't fucking around.

KYLE SULLIVAN:
Let's just tell them

that we're-- we
went all-American.

What can they do?

We're celebrating, right?

That's a great idea, Kyle.

TERRY: Fuck you, motherfuckers!

[police radio]

COP: Come here you
little piece of shit!

KYLE SULLIVAN: Hey, look.
We just went all-American today.

We're not criminals.

COP: Hey, now you are.

Is that that fucking camera on?

What-- what the fact is that?

COP 2: 2-11 in progress.

Let's roll.

COP 1: It's your lucky
fucking day, boys.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Thank you.

[police radio]

KYLE SULLIVAN: We are
some lucky motherfuckers.

-Give me my fucking
camera, would you?


-Terry?


KYLE SULLIVAN: Where is he?

Right over there.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Where'd Terry go?

Terry?

Terry!

Oh, my God.

He fell!

BARBARA SULLIVAN: Thank you.

Kyle, get up and do
something, honey.

The boxes are in the rain.

Come on.

-No smoking in front
of your mother.

Come on.

BARBARA SULLIVAN: Knock knock?

-Yeah?

BARBARA SULLIVAN: Can I come in?

-Yeah.

-I just wanted to know if
you wanted some of this stuff

in here.

-What is it?

BARBARA SULLIVAN:
Swimming stuff.

You know, trophies?

-Nuh-uh.

-Hm?

KYLE SULLIVAN: No,
I don't want it.

Throw it away.

Give it to Goodwill.


-This box is heavy.

I've got to set it down.

-Outside.


-Kyle, you want to
talk about anything?

-I don't know.

No.

We're here.

What else is there
to talk about?

-You're going to do fine here.

-I seriously doubt it.


-Mom?

-What?

KYLE SULLIVAN: Nevermind.

[interposing voices]


[interposing voices]

[whistle blowing]

CHLOE: You're busted.


No, seriously.

If you smoke here, Mr. Dunkel or
one of his goons will nail you.

There's only one place you
can go where it's cool.

So you want me to
show you or not?

So as my payment for taking
you here, can I bum a smoke?

I don't really smoke.

I'm just trying to
stop biting my nails.

I'm Chloe.

-Hey, I'm-- I'm Kyle.

CHLOE: Thanks, Kyle.

-So you're just
switching habits?

-Smoking is only temporary.

Do you like The Dead?

-Nah, a couple of
songs, not really.

-I'm a Deadhead, but
now that Jerry's dead,

I'm just kind of a loser.

-No, it just means you
listen to classic rock.

-Oh, God, that's worse.

Nothing but love songs.

-You like Primus?

-I love Primus!

-Yeah, they're OK.

You like metal?

-Yuck, no.

I'm into the peace
and love stuff.

You?

-Some.

The really loud stuff.

-In that case, you should be
hanging out with those guys,

a bunch of headbangers,
Black Circle Boys.

-What?

CHLOE: It's what
they call themselves.

They're into the occult and,
speed metal, and all that shit.

It's Shane's thing.

He's the crazy one over there.

He's been locked up
a couple of times.

He thinks he's the
Antichrist or something.

They say he killed
his little brother.

-Shane Carver?

-Personally, I think
he's an asshole,

but he has great drugs.

Thanks for the smoke.

-Thanks.

I mean, you're welcome.

COACH EARHORN: Joe Scaman.

JOE: Here.

COACH EARHORN: Rose Silsley.

ROSE: Here.

COACH EARHORN:
Jeremiah Sinclair.

JEREMIAH: Here.

COACH EARHORN: Kyle Sullivan.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Here.

COACH EARHORN: Rebecca Titus.

REBECCA: Here.

COACH EARHORN: Kyle Sullivan.

-You already called my name.

COACH EARHORN: Transferred
from California?

Kyle Sullivan, why aren't
you on the swim team?

All-American in two
events last year.

-Do I look All-American to you?


-Yeah.

You should see the
rest of the team.

Come on to practice, man.

We're dying out there.

COACH EARHORN: Larry Aal.

Here.

-I think they're in love.

MUNN: Yeah.

Sweet, isn't it?


COACH EARHORN: What
was that, Mr. Carver?

-Um, Mr. Munn and I were just
discussing the operation, sir.

-Well, Mr. Munn ought to
be the one to talk to.

I mean he tinkered with his
own brain to such tragic ends.

OK.

So what we got on
the table is a--

KYLE SULLIVAN: You Shane Carver?

COACH EARHORN: Standard
American bullfrog.

-You writing my biography?

-You got the band?

-We have a kick-ass band.

Not for little puke
narcs like you, though.

-I'm not a narc.

-Oh, you say.

KYLE SULLIVAN: I saw you
were looking for a drummer.

-Do you play?

KYLE SULLIVAN: Not
great, just basic stuff.

-Because this is going
to be an excellent band.

We're going to play gigs
in Seattle and shit.

We're going to be super
duper fucking hardcore.

None of that pussy bullshit.

You sure you're not a narc?


-I'm not a narc.

-You get high?

-Yeah.

-I saw you talking to Chloe.

She's a real babe.

-Yeah, she's OK.

-Like frogs?

-Not really.

SHANE CARVER: Me either.


COACH EARHORN: Mr. Carver,
what are you doing?


Mr. Carver?


What are you doing?

Carver--


Get off the table right now.


Get down.

Munn, shut up.

Carver, get down off
the table right now.

Get down.

Get off the table right now!

Oh, Jesus.

COACH EARHORN: Get off
the fucking table now!


Down!

Get down.


COACH EARHORN: Off
the fucking table now.

STUDENT: I can't
believe he ate it.

-Wait for me outside.


Everybody stay put and be
quiet until I get back.

-Fucking hardcore.


-Elbows off the table, please.

BARBARA SULLIVAN: Thank you.

-Eat your dinner.

-So how was school today?

-Fine.

-Answer your mother
in complete sentences.

-It was fine.

BARBARA SULLIVAN: Did you learn
anything new and exciting?

-Biology was cool.

We cut open frogs and
stimulated their muscles

with electrical wires
to make them twitch.

-Oh.

-One guy bit the
frog's head right off.

-Please, not at the table.

-Your hair is getting so dark.

KEN SULLIVAN: You miss
your old buzz cut?

-It used to get green from
the chlorine, remember?

-Is that better?

CHLOE: Kyle.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Hey,
how's it going?

Let me see your fingernails.

Hmm, no good.


We should smoke now.

-May I?

-Oh, hey, look.

Chloe's hanging with
little narc boy.

-Why don't you get an IQ, Munn.

You wouldn't know a
narc if he booked you.

That guy's got like
three brain cells left.

He's OD'd four times.

Once he was in the hospital
for two weeks for huffing Pam.

-What?

-Huffing Pam?

-I don't get it.

-The cooking spray.


-That's nasty.


COACH EARHORN: OK, so
this particular compound

could not be simpler.

Who wants to diagram it for me?

Anybody?

Well, it seems we have a
resident expert on water

right here in class.

Mr. Sullivan has
learned to defy the laws

of nature pertaining to water.

He's able to move through
it at alarming speed.

So it only seems right he should
come up and give it a shot.

What do you say, Mr. Sullivan?

-Leave me the fuck alone.

COACH EARHORN: I'm sorry.

What was that?

-I said leave me the fuck alone.

COACH EARHORN: Well, that's
not the right answer to all.

Why don't you go to
the principal's office

and talk to him about it?

That'll be fun.


-Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,

blah, blah, blah, good student.

Blah, blah, blah, All-American.

Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[phone ringing]

-Well, some schools
would buy you

a new car for transferring
to their team.

Some schools would have a-- a
special pep rally just for you.

We haven't done
those things, but I

think we've been
hospitable, don't you?

Why is it that kids are
normal, normal, normal,

and they come to
my school, and they

decide to become
career criminals?

-Get suspended?

-Nah, just ragged on
me for a little while.

-Isn't he a major prick, man?

-More like a little, tiny one.


-Did you blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah?

It never fails.

You know, I meant to cut that
motherfucker's tongue out.

I could do it, too.

RORY: No, shit.

No, shit.

-Munn's in the band.

He plays bass.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Cool.

-Me too, man.

-Yeah.

Ferry's maybe going to
play, um, with himself.


Excellent.

Nice.

All right.

Know where the park is?

-Think so.

The state park?

-Yeah.

Kroller State Park.

We hang out in
the woods straight

back from the playground.

It's like 10 minutes
walk, straight back.

You should come.

-Maybe, yeah.

-You should come.

BARBARA SULLIVAN: Kyle?

Kyle?

-Yeah?

-You going out?

-Yeah.

BARBARA SULLIVAN: Well,
your-- your father

is at some mysterious
meeting, and I thought maybe

you'd like to hang out
and watch a movie with me.

-Do you even know what he does?

Why we moved here?

-Computers, honey.

-Fucking asshole.

BARBARA SULLIVAN: Hey.

-He didn't even think about
what we were supposed to do.

BARBARA SULLIVAN:
That's not true.

He just--


doesn't know how to talk to you.

He took this job
with you in mind,

helping you get over Terry.

-Whatever.

I've got to go.

[breathing heavily]

-Munn?

[music playing]

SHANE CARVER: All right.

Woohoo!

I guess the bonus
finally arrived.

KYLE SULLIVAN: What's up?

SHANE CARVER: Kyle.

This is maybe going to
be our drummer ya'll.

Just moved all the way up
from California, right?

What's that?

The second biggest partying
state on the West Coast?


I invited Kyle here to
get fucked up with us.

Join the circle.

Don't worry about Munn.

He's mean.

He's stupid.


KYLE SULLIVAN: What
the hell is this?

-It's crystal.

It's nice, motherfucker.

it's good, right?

-Oh, shit.

-It's great, right?

Take some of this,
balance it out.

-What's that?

Acid?

-Nah, it's just mescaline.

-No way.

-Go on.

Take it.

You'll be way too fucked
up from the crystal.

Kyle, take it.

We all have to be equally
fucked up for the blood ritual.

-Wait, what?


SHANE CARVER: I'm just
fucking with you, dude.

Kyle Man, you better
take that [inaudible].

You're beginning to
look a little green.


Ferry?

Go get Kyle a beer.

RORY: I'll get him
a cold one, Shane.

-Now.

-Here.

I think this one's cold.

Is it cold?

-It feels cold.

-Taste it.

It's cold, I--I think.

-Tastes cold.


I'm Kyle.

-I'm Rory Leary.

-Hey, Rory.

-You can either call
me Leary or-- or Ferry,

but I like Rory the best.

-Yeah, I'll just call you Rory.

-Yeah.


Hey, maybe you can even
start a trend, you know?

-Get the fuck out of here.

What the fuck are you doing?

-Just trying to be
friendly, Shane.

-What did I say to you?

What did I say to you?

Did I tell you to be friendly?

Did I tell you to
hang around and chat?

Did I?

Get the fuck out of my face.

Go put some more
wood on the fire.

I keep Rory around to
run errands and shit.

I tell him he's in
the Black Circle Boys,

but-- but he has to spend
a year being my servant.

The little asshole
just takes it.

-What are the Black Circle Boys?

-You don't just ask
out of curiosity.

You know what I'm saying?

-No.

-You see all these people here?

They're in what I
call the circle.

A circle is not exclusive.

The Black Circle Boys-- super
exclusive, just me and Munn.

We let Ferry come along, but
he doesn't have the tattoo.

Munn, show Kyle the tattoo.

And Danny was in it, but
the fuckhead moved to Boise.

I'd love to cut his heart out
and feed it to his mother's

fucking little
Bichon Frise, and I

would have every right to do it.

You know what I'm saying?

A brotherhood is a brotherhood.

It's sacred, a fucking
blood oath to the father.

You don't just go and
move to fucking Boise.

You don't fuck with brotherhood.

I'm looking for a
warrior, someone

to get deep into the shit
because it gets fucking deep.

I'm talking about power
to do anything you want.

You could get like
any girl you want.

You could kick ass in school.

Personally, I never
use it for that.

For cars, money, fame,
girls, you name it, whatever.

And you could like
achieve it, but you

have to make a commitment.

So are you going to be a pussy?

Or are you going
to do some drugs?


All right.

[heart pounding]


-Kyle, are you OK?


KYLE SULLIVAN: Chloe.

CHLOE: Good.

You're not as
stoned as you look.

KYLE SULLIVAN: What
are you doing here?

CHLOE: I was at another party,
but I had to come out here.

I figured you'd be hanging
with the headbangers.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Mmm, you
came out just for me?

CHLOE: Yeah.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Oh, no.


It's just like Shane said.

CHLOE: Wow, I come out here
to party with these guys

every once in a
while, but they're

not exactly my kind of people.

-Where the fuck is he?

Kyle?

Guest of honor, and the
motherfucker isn't even here.

Kyle!

What are you doing with my boy?

-Shane, even in your
dreams, he's not your boy.

-That's cool.

It's just girl-related,
not a big deal.


Everybody put out your
left hand, all right?

We're going to make a little
offering to the father.

-Shane, what the
fuck are you doing?

-Shut the fuck up.

Everybody is going
to be fine, OK?

-What's your definition of fine?

Him?

-Do you want me to go first?

-I'm out of here.


SHANE CARVER: Let's go, Ferry.

Oh, father, through
the gift of your power,

we worship and honor you.

We worship and honor you alone.


SHANE CARVER: It's all done.

Thank you, father.

Hey, we're all done.

It's a fucking party.

Yeah!

We're just jammin' and jam,
and jam, and jam, and jam, jam.

-You can't air play drums.

-Yeah, you can.

-No, I'd have to go
like--I'd have to go--

-[inaudible].


MUNN: Open up.



MUNN: Whoo!


-What do you think
we should look like?

-Maybe we should see
what we sound like first.

-Yeah, but you want
to look cool, right?

I mean, Black Circle Boys.

You want to sound a
certain way, you know?

-Yeah.

-Did you get those drums yet?

-No.

Just a snare and a high hat.

-Don't worry about it.

We'll get you some drums.

Our fucking band is
going to kick ass.

Got the vehicle today?

-Yeah.

You need a ride?

-I've got something
you need to see.

There used to be a
whole wood pulp mill

here, man, before the logging
industry went to shit.

My dad used to make bucks.

Tug boats hauling
shit in and out.

-Your dad was a logger?

-Still is when there's work.

Sometimes when
they need people, I

go, um, go up with
him to set chokes.

Like when they're
hauling the trees away,

you've got to run and wrap
this big fucking cable around

and get out of the way before
it takes your hand right off.

-I don't even know
what my dad does.

-Yeah, but he
makes money, right?

-I guess.

-Check this out.

Here, come on.

KYLE SULLIVAN: doing, man?

It's cold.

SHANE CARVER: It doesn't matter.


SHANE CARVER

KYLE SULLIVAN (VOICEOVER): What?

SHANE CARVER (VOICEOVER): Power.

I'm getting more and more
powerful every second.

-What the hell did you do?

That was like 10 minutes.

No one in the world can
hold their breath that long.

-It's power.

You see it?

I'm alive and dead
at the same time.


Oh, uhh.

Oh, we're out of drugs.


Ah.

Let's go do some houses
and go visit Greggo.

-Yoohoo!

Yes!

Do some houses!

Do some houses!



MUNN: Oh, shit!


SHANE CARVER: Yes!

Fucking excellent!

Kyle, man?

Recreational drug users.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Oh.


MUNN: I love "Transformers."


-Yeah.

I like them so much.



-I mean, can you
imagine being a robot

who can change into a car.

And just go from robot
to car, robot to car,

never even having
to be a person?

-(ROBOT VOICE) Transformers.


SHANE CARVER: Now,
whatever you do,

don't say anything
about how fucking

bad Greggo's place stinks.

All right?

He's real sensitive about it.

All right?

KYLE SULLIVAN: All right.

RORY: Yeah.

[gun cocking]

-Shit, get down.

Grego?

Grego?

It's me, Shane, Shane Carver.

Come on.

Me and my friends got
some stuff for you.

It's cool.

Come on, it's Shane.

-Hidey, Shane.


Come on in.

Who's this?

KYLE SULLIVAN: I'm Kyle.

-Kyle, huh?

You look like a narc to me.

Are you a fucking
narc, pretty boy?

-Fuck you.


KYLE SULLIVAN: It's Kyle, man.

Greggo, he's a good soldier.

GREGGO: A good soldier, huh?

But will you fuck me?

Want to fuck me, good solider?


SHANE CARVER: No, Greggo.

He's going to take Danny's
place in the Black Circle Boys.

GREGGO: Danny?

Kyle is much
prettier than Danny.

So tell me Kyle, do
you accept our father?

KYLE SULLIVAN: Yeah.


KYLE SULLIVAN: I don't know.

I--I guess.

-Oh, he's so passionate.

It's nothing to be
ashamed of, you know.

It's not necessarily
a bad thing.

Now Shane here, on
the other hand, well,

that's a whole
different story, see?

Because Shane is a bad thing.



Now what do you boys got for me?

-Hey, let's go pool hopping.

MUNN: Yes!


-What's pool hopping?

MUNN: Give me a smoke, bag!

Whee!


[laughing and cheering]

MALE HOMEOWNER: Get the hell
out of my pool right now.

SHANE CARVER: Suck me!

MALE HOMEOWNER:
What did you say?

-I said suck me you old fart.

Fuck you.


[dog barking]

KYLE SULLIVAN: Let's go, Shane.

-Give me a fucking break.

What is he going to do?

Call the cops and get
us for trespassing?

MALE HOMEOWNER: I
know who you are.

-Oh, no!

Now I'm scared!

[dog barking]

FEMALE HOMEOWNER:
John, call the police.

-Hey, you sound sexy.

MALE HOMEOWNER:
You're Shane Carver.

You think I'm afraid of you?

SHANE CARVER: Oh,
I know you are.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Shane,
let's take off.

-Point a fucking gun at me?

MALE HOMEOWNER: Just go, please.

-You think I'm afraid of
death you old fuck, huh?

Look at me.

I'll take you straight to hell
with me you piece of shit.

I'll shove that fucking
thing right up your ass.

Come on, shoot me.

Come on, do it!

Do it.

Do it!

Shoot me!

Fucking shoot me!

Come on!

Come on.

Come on.

Shoot me.

Do it.

Fucking do it.

I'll make you suck
my cock in hell.

You're fucking dead.



That fucker is going to
pay for that shit big time.

Yeah.

I can't take all
this stuff home, man.

Munn, can you?

-No, they'll find it, man.

-Kyle?

-No, I don't think so.

SHANE CARVER: Don't you
be fucking look at me.

You'd fuck up somehow, I know.

-I guess.

SHANE CARVER: Nobody fucks
with this unless I say.

OK?

You got it?

-M-hm.

-Our secret, right?

[bell ringing]

COACH EARHORN: Kyle?

Sullivan?

Hey, come here.

-Hey, don't touch him.

-Go to class, Froggie.

-Look, man.

-What?

-Check it out.

-Kyle Man, is that you?

You're fucking white.

-Times like that, you
can get into any college

in the country.

-It's not me.

It's not my picture.

-Who's this?

-It's Kyle Sullivan.

He's totally cool.

Come on.

He's a friend of
mine from school.

-Let me go.

-I don't want him
to see my face.

Did you see my face?

Did ya?

-No.

-I'm going running.

And when I get back,
you'd both better be gone.

OK?

-OK.

-You girls stay out of trouble.


-Fucking survivalist.

He thinks if fewer
people see his face,

the better off he'll be when
he disappears into the woods.

You're a lucky man.

He could've snapped your neck.

-Great.

SHANE CARVER: Ronnie and Shane.

KYLE SULLIVAN:
That's your brother?

-Was.

Died.

-Ronnie and Shane.

Did you ever have somebody
that balances you out?

Like whatever you
are, it's completely

balanced out by who they are?

-Yeah.

I think so.

-He was totally good.

Not just-- not
just goodie-goodie.

You know?

Whenever you did
something bad, he

would just-- he would just look
at you like he didn't get it.

Not like he was mad or
anything, just I don't get it.

You better get out of here.

[door closing]


-Are you coming in?

-No.

CHLOE: on, it's hot.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Hey.

Stop it.

-Where are you, Kyle?

KYLE SULLIVAN: What do you mean?

-Half the time you're with
me, you're not really with me.

-That's way too abstract for me.

Hey.

CHLOE: seem like you're some
place else, sad all the time.

I mean, look where we are.

It's a beautiful day.

It's the first beautiful
day in the last ten years.

And there's nobody
here, just us.

[loud music playing]

-Let me see some ID.

-It's cool, man.

Greggo said we could come here.

BOUNCER: Yo, Greggo.

Oh, fuck you.


Whoo!

Where you at?

Come on over.


-We're going to be
bigger than these fucks.

Greggo [inaudible].

ANGRY WOMAN: I know
you can see me!

--[inaudible] playing
in here [inaudible].

ANGRY WOMAN: Bastard.

-Fuck them.

They're going to
open for us, right?

-Yeah.

ANGRY WOMAN: Lane.

Lane something.

No, Shane!

Shane!

You fucked up my
little brother's eyes.

You hit him with a bottle.

You little fucking ass!

He can't even
fucking see anymore.

He can't even see!

Fuck you!

-Let's go kick some ass!

-Yeah!


[band playing]


Whoo!

-What the fuck are you
doing on stage, man?

-I want to give you
some drugs, man.

Fucking crystal and shit.

-Awesome.

-Check that out.

-Excellent.

-I was hoping you guys'
band would get together

with us later and
give us some advice.

-Yeah.

Yeah.

Why don't we start
off with this.

Fuck off.

Fuck you, man.

You fucking piece of shit!


[punching and kicking]

[yelling and cheering]



[interposing voices]


-Kyle?

Kyle?

Your father and I were
wondering if you'd

like to talk about Terry?

KYLE SULLIVAN: No, thanks.

-We'd like to know
how you're feeling.

-Why don't you read
the police report, Mom?

They were pretty interested
in the whole thing.

They could probably
tell you more than me.

-No, how you're feeling.

-You're only like
eight months late, Mom.

-Yeah, well, sometimes we're
just shitty parents, Kyle.

I'm trying, OK?

-It doesn't matter.

-You know, your father and I--

-What's all this "you
father and I" crap?

I don't see him here.

He hasn't been in this
room since we moved here.

All I see is the back of his
head staring at the television.

-Sweetheart--

-Get out.

-Don't talk to me like that.

-Get out of my fucking room.

-No!

-Please, Mom?

-No.

[music playing loudly]

KYLE SULLIVAN: Get out
of my fucking room!

SHANE CARVER: We're meeting
at the cemetery tonight at 11.

You know that?

-No, man, I got
to get some sleep.

-[inaudible].

This is business.

This isn't optional.

-OK, but if I fall
asleep, you know--

-Don't worry.


He'll be wide awake
for this, right?


KYLE SULLIVAN: I bet.

SHANE CARVER: Rory
will be asleep.


So you should see the drums I
was checking out for you, man.

They're fucking excellent.

-Man, I'm telling you, you're
going to be disappointed.

-Bullshit, man.

Our fucking band is
going to kick ass, right?


SHANE CARVER: Just wait
until you see this.

This is the real shit, Kyle.

We're going to do ourselves
a little grave robbing.

Teach that motherfucker to
point a fucking gun at me.

So I find out they're
like a big family, right.

They've been around
since the 1800s.

They have a huge plot up here.

Munn, pick up the drugs.

SHANE CARVER: Mesc--

-What?

SHANE CARVER: Somebody
took the Mescaline.

-Don't look at me.

You said not to open up the bag.

SHANE CARVER: Fucking Ferry.

RORY: Hey.

Hey, Shane?

Check out what I got for you.

Check out what I
got for you, man.

I got you this guitar.

-You know what you did?

-It's got all these
features on it.

It's got all these--
look at these knobs

here that you can play.

-Just tell me you have
the Mescaline, Ferry.

-I got it from Todd
Presnall, right?

And he said that
he would give it

to me for special
deal beca-- Oh!

-Shut up.

Shut the fuck up!

You tell me you
know what you did?

You fucked with
the Black Circle.

You know that?

You fucked with the brotherhood.

-Yeah.

-What were you thinking?

-I traded a guitar for you.

-I know that.

But you went behind my back.

And you stole from me.

You stole from every
single one of us.

[breathing heavily]

-I just thought when you
saw the guitar, Shane--

-Let me see the guitar, Ferry.

[quickly strumming guitar]

-I like the guitar, Ferry.

-You do?

Oh, Shane, it's got features.

And there's an amp in the car.

-But you still fucked up.

You are in trouble.

-I know.

I know.

-Let me spell it
out for you, OK?

Without the mescaline, we
cannot do the blood ritual.

Pissed me off.

You displeased the father.

-I didn't mean to
displease the father.

I didn't mean to
displease the father.

-What am I going to
do with you, Ferry?

-I'm sorry.

-You see why you're not ready to
be a part of the Black Circle?

Do you?

-Uh-huh.

Yeah, I fucked up.

I fucked up.

-And you're going to have
to work extra hard, right?

-OK.

-Right?

-I will.
-Right?

Yes?

-I will.

Yeah.

-And you're going to pay
me back for the drugs?

200?

-Uh-huh, I will.

SHANE CARVER: Now get
down there and make

some soul ride in hell.

Hey, Ferry, let's see
how fast you can dig.

-OK.


I can dig fast, you know.

The ground is all squishy.

Oh, wow.

Oh, oh--

-Just the skull
and the left hand.

RORY: Oh, Shane.

I may not be too good at this.

-Come on, Rory.

Here's the fucking
flashlight, huh?

-I don't feel so well.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Rory, let's
get you out of there.

-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Wait a minute!

We're not done.

And you're on fucking probation!

What does that mean to you?

When things get tough,
you get up and take off?

Bullshit!

Fuck that, right, Munn?

-Don't be a fucking
pussy, Ferry!


SHANE CARVER: Know what?

RORY: Knock it off!

-I'm going to bury you alive.

RORY: Fucking knock it off.


RORY: OK.
SHANE CARVER: Go.

RORY: I--
[rory gagging and choking]

-[inaudible]--
-Pussy!


Man, you're such a pussy.



RORY: I'll fucking do it.

I'm going to do it right now.


RORY: OK.

OK, I'm doing it right now.


RORY: OK.

I swear to God, I'm
doing it right now.

I'm doing it, OK?

-You promise, huh?

-Do it!

Stop the car.

[tires screeching]

KYLE SULLIVAN: It's OK, Rory.

It's OK.

-I'm scared, Kyle.

MUNN: Shut the fuck
up, diaper load.

And don't you sit there
holding his fucking hand.

Both of you just grow up.

[cat meowing]

-Hey Rory, can I
give you a hand?


Greggo said fresh blood
on the bones of the dead

would force their spirits
right back into their bodies.

That doesn't feel too good when
you've been dead for 30 years.

Hey, honey.

[cat meowing]

Hey.

Hey.

Hey.

Such a nice kitty.

Yes, you are.

A nice kitty.

Yes, yes.

[cat meowing]

Yes.

[cat growling]

Nice kitty.

[cat screeching]


[chanting quietly]

[tapping on window]

-I-- I'm scared, Kyle.

I don't know-- I
don't know what to do.

-It seems like you've
got to pay him back.

-Where am I going to get $200?

My mom-- she caught me trying
to steal money from her.

Now I can't even
get near her purse.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Why'd
you take the Mescaline?

Rory, that was fucking stupid.

-I just thought if I walked
up to Shane with a guitar,

it wouldn't have mattered where
the money came from, you know?

He would just say to me, I'm OK.

I'm OK.

After all, because I got him
this cool guitar with all the,

you know, little special
features and stuff.

Shitty Mescaline for a
cool guitar, you know?

I mean-- he was telling us we're
going to have this band when

we get all the
instruments, Kyle.

So I did it.

-Yeah.

-I'm scared.

I'm scared.

-Just don't worry about it.

All right.

I'm not going to
let him hurt you.

Just chill out until
you get the money.

-Yeah.

SHANE CARVERY: That's a stupid
fucking name for a band, man.


They deserve to get
ripped off, huh?

MUNN: Fuck them!

-We've got to get our
name put on there, huh?

Black Circle Boys, right?

You like these?

KYLE SULLIVAN: Yeah.

SHANE CARVERY:
They're nice, right?

KYLE SULLIVAN:
Yeah, they're nice.

SHANE CARVERY: Yeah.

Hey, Munn?

We got any beers, man?

Let's have some beers.

-Oh, yeah, man, there's a
whole fucking fridge full.

SHANE CARVERY: Right on.

KYLE SULLIVAN:
I'd go for a beer.

SHANE CARVERY: All right.

Ferry, would you mind getting
us some fucking beers?

Come on!


SHANE CARVERY: What the
fuck are you thinking?


[strumming guitar]


SHANE CARVERY: To
the band, right?

To the band.

So should we play?

[playing bass]


SHANE CARVERY: Whoa.


[attempting to play guitar]

SHANE CARVERY: This
fucking guitar sucks.

I can't play this.

I can't play this.

MUNN: Me either, man.

RORY: I could play a few things.


-Shut the fuck up, Ferry.

All right?

KYLE SULLIVAN: Maybe we need to
take some lessons or something.

-I don't want to take lessons.

I want to have a
fucking bad, all right?

Two, three, four--

[ATTEMPTING TO PLAY GUITAR,
BASS, AND DRUMS]

Let's fucking be like Neocide.

Neocide, right?

Neocide!

Yes!

Ready?


SHANE CARVERY:
Two, three, four--

[ATTEMPTING TO PLAY GUITAR,
BASS, AND DRUMS]

RORY: Hey.

SHANE CARVERY: Get me
my goddamn money, Rory.


RORY: Shit.

[banging on door]

-Shane Carver?

-So?

-Detective Ray,
Mercer island Police.

I have a warrant
for your arrest.

-Bullshit.

[clock ticking]

[rustling around]

SHANE CARVERY: Can I crash here?

-Yeah, no problem.

How'd you get in?

-Kitchen window.

-What happened?

-Released in my
father's custody.

-Sleeping bag OK?

-Yeah.

[unzipping bag]

KYLE SULLIVAN: Jesus.

Shane, what'd he do?

-Motherfucker is strong.

KYLE SULLIVAN: You want
some aspirin or something?


SHANE CARVERY: Nah.

I had some of that
stuff with codeine.

You want some?

KYLE SULLIVAN: No thanks.

-Sleeping bag.

Me and Ronnie--


We used to sleep out in
the backyard in a tent

every time it wasn't raining.

We'd be like all over the place.

Then we'd sneak
back in the house,

steal eggs, and go
nail houses with them.

Ronnie would be like
do whatever you want.

I'm just going to lie here
and listen to the crickets.

I'd be like OK,
just for one minute.

And boom, I'd be out.

And I'd wake up and be
there the next morning.


CHLOE: So you were
with him then?


-Who cares?

-Just tell me if you
were there or not.

-I was.

-And you saw him
dig that stuff up?

-He made Rory do it.

-Jesus, Kyle, he's
really lost his shit.

You've got to stop
hanging out with him.

-He's my friend.

No one else in this
stuck-up school

came running up to me
offering to be my friend.

-What about me?

Did I not do that?

Look, I grew up with the guy.

And, like I said,
he's got great drugs.

But he's not anybody's friend.

And he's not anybody's brother.

He's a fucking lunatic.

-That's your opinion.

And it's not like
anybody got hurt.

-Nobody got-- what is with you?

It's like you're on some
kind of weird planet

where nobody can touch you.

And you watch
Shane do this shit,

and it's like you have
no fucking reaction.

You're perfect for him, just
another zombie like Munn.

-Are you finished?

-Yeah, I'm finished.

I'm totally finished with
you and your asshole friends.

You can go to hell.

-Chloe?

Chloe?

SHANE CARVERY: Bullshit!

Fuck you!

Motherfucker kicked me
out of school forever!

He fucking kicked me out!

He's kicked me out like six
times, but never forever!

Let's go, Kyle.

We've got shit to do!

CHLOE: What are you going to do?

SHANE CARVERY: Get the
fuck out of here, Chloe.

This is business.

-Business?

Like you ever had business?

-Let's go, dude.

Right now.

We've got brotherhood business.

[glass breaking]

SHANE CARVERY: Yeah!

Yeah!

[glass breaking]


MUNN: Fuck you!


SECURITY GUARD: Hey, come on.

I didn't do anything, guys.

Hey.

-Let's go, you fuck!

Come on.

Come on.


Come on.

Fuck him up.

Yeah.


MUNN: Fucking [inaudible].

Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Fuck you!


SHANE CARVERY: [inaudible].

Fucking do it!

Do it!

-Do it, Kyle!


SHANE CARVERY: Take it!

Finish him off!

Come on.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, come on!

Kill him!

-Do it!

SHANE CARVERY: Finish him off.

-Do it, Kyle.

-Get the fuck out of
my face right now!

-You fucked up.

You fucked up.

Ah!

Ah!

Let's go.

[man groaning]

Kyle?

Kyle Man?

Kyle, let's get the fuck out
of here before I get busted.

Come on!

-Sullivan!

[whistle blowing]

COACH EARHORN: Swimmers,
take your mark.

[whistle blowing]

Swimmers, take your mark.

[whistle blowing]


Oh, it's a catastrophe.

Come on!

Hey, Sullivan?

You want to show these
weenies how to dive?

-Nah.

-You all right?

-Can I crash here?

-I don't know.

No, you can't crash here?

-Kyle Man, what do you mean?

-I don't want you here.

-Hey.

-I'm sick of it.

Shane, all we do is run around
and do mean stuff to people.

What's the point?

SHANE CARVERY: The point is
I saw you for the first time

the other night taking
all your bad shit

inside and turning
it into power.

That's the fucking point.

That's what

Right?

-I don't know.

-Kyle Man, he
talked to me, and he

told me all kinds of cool shit.

And he said my father
isn't even my real father.

He said he's my father-- that
all this stuff we're doing,

all of it-- it's for him.

-Yeah?

Well, I'm sick of it.

-You don't have that
option to be sick.

Like I told you when
you got down with us,

we don't do this shit
lightly because it's

the fucking brotherhood.

-You're not my brother,
and I'm not your brother.

So fuck your brother.

SHANE CARVERY: Don't start
saying that stuff, Kyle.

Don't start digging
your own fucking grave.

You don't want to do that.

-Get the fuck out of my house.

-You're so lucky
I love you, Kyle.

You have no idea.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Hey.

Hey, Chloe?

-What's up?

-I was wondering
if we could talk.

-What?

Talk.

-Uh, maybe we could
hook up after school.

[bell ringing]

He landed between two buildings,
and he was there for a while

because we had to
get the janitor

to unlock all the doors.

And he was drunk.

Cops-- they took
forever to come back

because they were still
pissed at us about their car.

His neck was broken, but he
was still alive when he landed.

He just laid there.

And he couldn't move.

So what actually finished
him off was the waiting.

After that, I just kind
of went numb, I guess.

You know, like someone lowered
a big, glass dome over me.

And ev-- everything
on the outside

was like some-- like a
TV show or something.

Shane's the same
way all the time.

He-- he-- he-- he can do
anything and not even blink.

-Be careful, Kyle.

-So as the egg moves toward
maturity, it begins to divide.

These divisions are
called cleavages.

And these cleavages
form a number

of cells which form a
hollow ball called what?

Anybody have any idea
what I'm talking about?

Does anybody have the slightest
clue what the answer might be?

Anybody awake?

Who wants to take a crack at it?

Anybody?

Mr. Sullivan?

-What?

-Kyle Sullivan?

-Yeah.

DETECTIVE RAY:
I'm Detective Ray.

I want to ask you a few
questions about Shane Carver.

-Sorry.

DETECTIVE RAY: We know
about all the shit, Kyle--

all the shit you were
involved in with Shane.

Here, take my card.

Hey, take the card.

SHANE CARVERY: We'll just
see if he's in there.


Whoop de-doo!

It's Professor Butt-wipe in
the parlor with a candlestick.


How about taking a
break, Professor?

-What's up?

-Party for the circle.

-Nah, man, I'm wasted.

SHANE CARVERY: No shit, man.

It's an actual party.

Hey.

No weird shit.

No Satan.

Just hang out, drink a
couple beers, get high--


-Nothing fancy.

KYLE SULLIVAN: I don't know.

MUNN: Come on, dude.

-It'll only be a couple hours.

Promise.

I guess everyone got
scared by the rain.

MUNN: Yeah.

SHANE CARVERY: Oh,
look what we have here.

RORY: Hey.

Hey.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Hey, Rory.

RORY: Hey.

Shane?

Hey, uh, Shane, I got
something for you.

Check it out.

-Wow.

Thanks, Rory.

RORY: So I'm all paid up.

You know, I've got to
lay low because my mom,

you know, she's going to flip.

-Right.

-So, uh, it's cool for me
to hangout with you guys?

SHANE CARVERY: You know,
I'd give all this money

back for a decent
fire right now.

Wouldn't you, Munn?

-Yeah.

SHANE CARVERY: Kyle?

-Yeah, it's cold.

I think I'm-- I'm gonna--

SHANE CARVERY: No, let's get
a fire going so we can party.

People will start
showing up, right?

Hey.

Think you can get us a fire
going, and make it burn,

make it burn like hell?

RORY: Yeah.
SHANE CARVERY: Yeah?

-Yeah, I can do that.

I can make a fire.
SHANE CARVERY: Big motherfucker?

-Yeah.

SHANE CARVERY:
I'll tell you what.

If you get us a fire going--
a nice fire going-- I'll

give you your tattoo tonight.

-Oh, serious?

SHANE CARVERY: Serious.

-Oh, shit!

Hah!

No way, really?

I'm going to get the tattoo?

SHANE CARVERY: I said if.

-Oh, I know.

Shane, I know.

I saw a good statue of
wood like, uh, 20 feet--

SHANE CARVERY: Shut up.

RORY: Uh-huh.

OK, I'm gonna-- here I go.

I'm going to get my tattoo done.

I'm going to get my tattoo done.

Woohoo!


That whole damn
cub scout thing was

worth it just for that, man.

SHANE CARVERY:
Congratulations, dude.

-Oh, serious?

Oh, wow.

Oh.

Oh.

SHANE CARVERY: Ready for your
initiation and your tattoo?

RORY: Really?

I'm a Black Circle Boy now?

SHANE CARVERY: Not yet.

-Right.

The initiation and shit.

-Come on.

Come to me.

Come on.

It's OK.

Take off your jacket.

RORY: OK.

SHANE CARVERY: And your shoes.

And your pants.

Now I want you to stand
here before the father.

-That's it.

Come on.

Rory, let's go.

MUNN: Shut the fuck up!

RORY: Yeah, shut up, Kyle.

I'm getting my fucking
initiation now.

SHANE CARVERY: Now
I want you to kneel.

-He's just fucking with you.

MUNN: Go ahead, Get out of
his face, you son of a bitch.

SHANE CARVERY: I
want you to show me

just how much you
love the father.

Say you love the father.

Say you love him.

RORY: Uh, you love the father.

KYLE SULLIVAN: Oh, come on, man.

He paid you your money.

-Kyle, shut the fuck up!

-Say it right!

-I love the father.

SHANE CARVERY: That's it.

That's it.

That's it.


I love the father.

-I love the father.

-Shane, leave him alone!

-That's it.

Say it again.

-I love the father.

-Say it again.

RORY: I love the father.

I love the father.
KYLE SULLIVAN: I'm taking off.

Come on.

Rory, you want to come with me?

-Say it with me.

I love the father.

I love the father.

-I love the father!

-This guy's a loser.

-Leave him alone.

Kyle, shut the fuck up!

-I love the father!

I love the father!

-Munn, make him stay!

[chanting i love the father]

-Rory!


-Come on!

I love the father!

Now you get your tattoo.

-No!

-Oh!

[breathing heavily]

-You don't fuck with
the Black Circle!

RORY: Ow!



[breathing heavily]

-I'm sorry, Mom.


-I take you as my brother,
and this is the shit I get.

Now we're brothers
in murder, Kyle,

because that's how
much I love you.

He told me this
is what he wanted.

MUNN: I'm going to
ice you, motherfucker!

SHANE CARVER: He said it
is what he wanted, Kyle.

-Hi.

-Hi.

-Are you OK?

-I don't feel good.

-You look terrible.

-Yeah, I think I'm
going to go home.

-Do you want a ride?

I have the car today.

-No.

I'll see ya.

-Kyle, are you getting
weird on me again?

-I'm sorry.

-Kyle?

[door opening]


-Wow.

Look at your little jammies.


Those are so nice.


Would you like to sit down?

Join us for breakfast?

KYLE SULLIVAN: No thanks.

SHANE CARVER: We
came by to say hi.

You haven't been around.

-I've been sick.

-Yeah, and I've been living
in an abandoned car tucked

underneath the freeway overpass.

You should stop by sometime.

-Nobody knows about Rory.

-That's right.

Do you intend to do
something about it?

-No way.

-Hm?

-His mom thinks he ran away.

-Because if one of us
goes down, we all go down.

It's like all or nothing.

We get busted, we hang up.

It's like a pact, right?

But what I'm saying is
it looks really good.

I think we're going
to be totally cool.

-You guys done eating?

-Yeah.

Yeah, it was really good.

Thank you very much.

-Good.

Now get the fuck
out of my house.


KYLE SULLIVAN: Yeah.

Look, there's this kid.

Nobody gives a shit.

His name is Rory Leary.

And he was murdered.

Uh, I was there.

About a week ago.

You said you wanted
Shane Carver?

Well, you can have him.

I'll be down there in an hour.

Hi.

Can I talk to Chloe, please?

Thanks.

-Everything you saw,
exactly as you remember it.

I think we can work
real well with this.

[phone ringing]

DETECTIVE RAY: Come
on [inaudible].

Come on.

-Tell him what you
told me [inaudible].

-Kyle, do you know what it means
legally to be offered a deal?

-Just from like "NYPD
Blue" and stuff.

Now the detectives are going to
want to take you onto the crime

scene, locate the body, get a
general idea of what happened.

KYLE SULLIVAN: It
happened right over here.

Yeah.

I see some bottles and stuff.

KYLE SULLIVAN: And there
was a-- a line [inaudible].

It led over there where he is.

Uh, he-- he was right there.

He was.

-You guys spread out and look
around this area, all right?

[phone ringing]

[clock ticking]

[phone ringing]

-What?

DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE): Kyle?

Sherman Ray.

Is it true you were
doing hallucinogens?

-What?

DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE): Is it
possible there was no murder?

That Shane and others
were trying to scare you?

-Wait.

Hold on a second.

DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE): I'd
say it was a bunch of bullshit,

but we can't find
anything at the scene.

No blood or anything.

No clothing.

They're saying that they were
playing some kind of trick

on you.

And you were under the
influence of Mescaline,

which made you
think it happened.

-Do you believe him?

DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE): It
doesn't really matter, Kyle.

There's no physical evidence.

Rory's parents are convinced
that he's run off to Seattle.

He took money from them.

Carver and Munn have
confirmed that he

left for Seattle last night.

-That money was
to pay back Shane.

DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE): Their
lawyers are raising a stink.


We had to let them go until
we have something more.

-You let him go?

DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE):
A couple hours ago.

[dial tone]

[busy signal]

-Fuck!

[tires screeching]

Oh, fuck!

-Now try to move.

It won't feel too good.

Kyle, Shane is your brother in
the power of the circle of sin.

If you condemn him, that is
a crime punishable by death.

Do you understand that
somebody will have to kill you?

Good.

See, I'd kill you myself,
but I have no intention

on going to jail
for Shane Carver.

Besides--


I like you.

But see?

Shane doesn't like you anymore.

And whether he's in
jail or out of jail

he will find
someone to kill you.


I suggest that we,
uh, just remember

that this whole thing
was just a little prank.


OK?

Is that clear?



-Is that clear, you little fuck?

Huh?

The way I fucked your little
girlfriend after I killed her.

Did you ever fuck
a dead girl, huh?

Piece of shit!



-You're alive?

-You're alive.

-Will you hand me the phone?

-You should just rest.

-Give me the phone.

Thanks.

-Hi.

Detective Ray, please?

Hey, it's Kyle Sullivan.

I think they were right
about the whole thing.

I think they set
me up for a prank.

No, really.

I, uh-- I think it was a prank.

No, no.

No, look, I-- I
don't want your deal.

OK, forget it.

SHANE CARVER: Munn,
what are you thinking?

-Nothing.

Just shit.

-I know what you're
thinking about.

-What?

-All the shit you
said to the detective.

All the shit you're going to
say to him when he fucking pulls

you in again for
questioning, huh?

I-- I didn't say a
fucking word, Shane.

I--if I did, they'd have our
asses locked up right now.

-He told me about some
of the shit you said.

About how I'm the
fucking leader.

About how you do whatever I say.

All kinds of shit.

You going to give me up, Munn?

Would you do that to me?

-Fuck you!

Man, Shane, I--

-Hey.

I'm just checking.

You wouldn't lie
to me, would you?

You're a good fucking
soldier, aren't you?

-I'm a good soldier.

-That's right.

You're the fucking best, man.

You're a fucking
go bot, aren't you?

-Yeah.

-Huh?

-Yeah.

-Let's go get high.
