<i>Dre, I know you've been wanting</i>
<i>this body for a long time.</i>

I know you fantasize
about me.

You damn skippy.

I've been knowing you since you were
a little boy. But you know something?

I think it's time you get
what you been dreaming of.

Yes, indeedy.

Now, let me see
what we're working with.

You're really not
a little boy anymore.

You think you can handle
that, Mrs. Anderson?

Hey, hey, hey.
Don't get cocky with me now.

I'm old enough to be your mama.
Yes, ma'am.

The real question is...

can you handle...

Damn!
All of this?

Hmm? You think you can?

It ain't but one way
to find out.

Dre!

It's almost 9:00.
You need to wake up.

Listen. I'm gonna run some errands
and I'm gonna go by the mall.

I prepared a turkey. I want you
to put it in the oven on low, Dre.

Okay?

You ain't got to worry with that, baby.
I helped make that one.

Ma!
You're a lot like your daddy.

He called.
Said he was gonna come by.

Yes, ma'am.
You know what my rule is.

Yes, ma'am.

That's a monster.

What this fool

Probably done stole
Slim mama Kick N Go.

Now, back to
your mama, A.J.

We need to get off of mamas
'cause I just got off of yours.

Old-ass joke.
Whatever.

I didn't do nothing.
Take it easy, asshole.

Nobody did nothing, right?

I told you I didn't do nothing, man.
What do we got here?

Suspect in the armored truck crash.
We're taking him to the precinct.

Yeah, exactly.
You were. Okay?

Now, take a hike.
Thank you. We'll take him from here.

Go fetch yourself a mop.
Asshole, man.

Unbelievable.
Look at his face.

Come on, guys.
Let's go to a strip joint.

So what we doing today?
Same thing we did yesterday.

Just stand out here
and talk about everybody.

Especially the gay zebra
right here, dog.

<i>National He</i>- <i>ographics.</i>

So, what's up?
Nothing you need to know about, Boom.

Yeah, Boom, get your freaky ass
on away from here, man.

"Exsqueeze" me.
Your mama's a freaky ass.

What the hell you want, Boom?
Let me see.

My fortune tells me
that I wanted a big dick...

but obviously I don't
see one around here.

Click, click.

So, did you eat the last penis
they gave you?

Hey, Boom,
seriously, though, man...

I would let you use mine...

but Earl mama
using it right now.

See, you likes to play funny,
but just to let you know...

you wouldn't know what a big dick
look like if you woke up with one.

I'm sorry.
Click, click.

Probably looks like the one
that's always in your mouth.

I heard the police was over here.
You heard wrong.

I don't know what's so funny.
Where is your sister?

I don't know.
What you want with my sister?

Don't trip.

Sometimes you go through a close family
member to get what you really want.

Click, click.

Now, we know you grabbed a bundle
of cash from the armored truck crash.

I don't know what you're talking about.
You just run from the site...

of an armored truck crash
every day?

Lf one crashes every day.
You hear that? He's a fucking comedian.

Why did you run if you
didn't grab any money?

To be honest with you,
I was out on my daily jog...

and I ran past the accident.
Your daily jog, huh?

Hey, man!
Tell me about that daily jog!

Relax!
You need to control your monkey, man.

I know my rights.
Shut up! We're not through with you.

I looked at your rap sheet. We can
keep you here for a couple of days...

or you can cooperate and be out
of here in a few minutes.

Huh?
Man, y'all some crooked cops.

I'm not saying nothing
until I get my phone call.

You're gonna get your
phone call from jail.

Son of a bitch.

You and Boom look like
y'all make a good couple anyway.

Man, y'all make
a good couple of nuts.

What's up, fellas?

Nothing.
Now that you hiding the sun.

Otis, we needed
some shade.

Yeah, that's a little jokey-joke
'cause I'm a little overweight.

Hey, Otis, ain't nothing little
about you, bro.

Yeah, your mama must've told you that.
Please stay off my mama.

And why is
my mail open?

It's just a little check
for your family to smoke up.

At least we smoking weed
and not turkey.

That's real funny. But what you need
to do is put some lotion on you.

I've seen volcanoes
ain't that ashy.

Stop. Man, ain't nobody...
There's your little piece of mail too.

Guess what.
Your grandmama died.

Oh, man. How did that happen?
She drowned.

Sorry to hear
that, Earl, man.

Well, shit happens.

I told her,
"Take showers." "Take showers."

Hold up. This ain't for me, Otis.
This is for 1508.

I'm at 1580, fat ass.

You got me crying over
somebody else's grandmama, man.

Shit. My bad.
Y'all all look the same to me.

Get your fat ass away from here.
Stop reading people mail too.

Well, guess what. Next time it might
really be for one of y'all.

And it could be
for that chili dog too.

Man, ain't that illegal?
Yeah.

I need to take
his round ass to court.

Why, so they can arrest you
for your warrants?

He got a point.
Yeah, that's true.

True dat, man.
You better come correct.

Well, hey, Shamu.

How you doing, Moses?
What, you ain't dead yet?

I'll live to bury
your fat ass.

At least I ain't late.

Didn't they tell you when they made you
a mailman, you was gonna have to walk?

Yeah, at least
I don't need a walker.

Funny.
Here's your mail.

Give me my stuff.
Give me my stuff.

Hey! Look at this.
Look at this. Look at this.

The Clearinghouse sweepstakes.
I'm gonna be a rich son of a bitch.

Won't even have you
for a mailman no more...

'cause I'm gonna be up on the hill.
Guess what.

You didn't win.

Son of a bitch. I told you not
to be reading my mail.

You think someone's
sending me food?

Guess what. If they did,
you ain't gonna get it.

Yeah, I believe that.
You need to read that bill there...

'cause your lights
about to be turned out.

And you better read it while you can.
'Cause it's gonna be dark soon.

Son of a bitch.

Get out of here, you fat fuck.
Get out of here.

Oh, yeah.

Wonder if he got
a dog up in here.

Damn boogers.

Movin' day. Movin' day.

This boy needs
some roughage.

What's this?

Glove.

Knife.

Damn O.J.
O.J. been in the trash.

Another box full of nothing.
Look at this.

Just nothing but junk.
My goodness. What's in here?

Jesus!

God Almighty!

This is my day, baby.

What the hell you doing back here?
Nothin'.

Get your ass up out my backyard.
All right.

Up in my trash. Man, go on!
Go on back in the house.

Get your ass out my backyard.
I'm gettin' out.

Man, fuck you!
Mess with me...

I'm gonna stomp a nut in your ass,
old baby shit-colored nigga.

Kick your nuts up around your chin,
make a bow tie.

Get in the house!

You a baby shit!
Your mama!

Look at that.
See that?

It's... That's why I don't live
in the neighborhood.

How did you get out
of the neighborhood?

I never was
in the neighborhood, you know?

But that's
a good reason why.

It's garbage. The pants are hanging
halfway down by their assholes.

That's ridiculous.
Fashion. That's fashion?

That's considered a fash... It's
a fashion faux pas. That's what it is.

That's bullshit.
That's what I say.

It's all ghetto mentality.
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto.

Hey, Dre, what you lookin' for?
Nothin'.

Well, can I help you find
whatever you lookin' for?

No, you can't.
Thank you, Boom.

Why you up
so early anyway, man?

My mama talkin' about kicking me out
the house at the end of the month.

Why?
Well, she got this new boyfriend.

And he just... he ain't comfortable
with another man in the house.

But see, that's cool 'cause I done
heard that before, so it's all right.

Well, what you gonna do?

See, I got a cousin that lives in D.C.,
all the way over there somewhere.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong with D.C.?

Ain't nothin' wrong with D.C. It's
a party town. I'm, like, do your thing.

I like to get my boogie on,
so, you know, it's cool.

Other than the fact that I ain't got
the money, and the plane ticket's $600.

$600 for a plane... You can get
a plane ticket for 250 in coach easy.

Coach? I know you didn't
say "coach" to me...

'cause I'm a queen bee bitch
and I fly first class.

You should know, Dre.
Well, catch the bus, Boom.

A bus? A bus is 36 hours,
plus I'm "clausaphobia."

It's "claustrophobic," Boom.
Well, whatever you wanna call it.

You know what
I'm tryin' to say, Dre.

What do you want, Boom?
Have you seen Tasha?

No. Why don't
you ask Slim?

I've already asked Slim,
but he ain't even seen her either.

Lf he ain't seen her, I ain't seen her.
Are you going to the block party?

I don't know. I might.
Good. I'll see you there then, right?

Maybe, Boom.

Okay, Boom.

Okay, Boom.

Man, who this?

Look, don't worry
about who this is.

Oh, hey, sorry about that, Diggs.
Hey, man, this is Mike.

Yeah, Mike
from Crenshaw, dog.

I'm gonna handle that
for you, man.

I swear to God I'm gonna handle
your business for you.

Yeah. Hold on.

Hey, is there a Tome in here?
I'm Tome.

One of you fools Tome?
I'm Tome.

Come get the phone, Toby.
Who is it?

Man, don't worry about who it is.
Just come get the phone, fool.

Hello.
Where is it?

Where's what?
I will have you killed right now...

and be out tomorrow
celebrating your death.

Don't fuck with me.
Man, you said I had a week.

I said you had a week.
Well, I lied, asshole.

I heard you came
into some money.

Who told you that?
Don't fucking worry about who told me.

Where's my fucking money,
motherfucker?

Well, they lied to you.
You know how people be lying.

Listen to me, motherfucker.
Turn your ass around.

<i>Now, you see that big</i>
<i>motherfucker looking at you?</i>

Wave.

That's right. Now, where is
my motherfucking money?

<i>If I tell you, you'll kill me.</i>
If you don't, I'll have you killed.

Baby, if you're gonna sit on my car,
give it a little buff.

There you go.
A little to the right.

You looking good, baby.
You looking good. Where's my money, man?

My lawyer said I'll be out in a few
hours. Then I'll give you what I owe.

I want my money. I want my money.
I'm gonna be on my spot.

You get my money to me
by midnight tonight or that's your ass.

All right, man, cool. So I'll talk
to you when I get out, all right?

I'm gonna be right here.
All right, cool.

Baby, baby.

Give it a little buff. You ain't doing
nothing else. You looking all good.

You got your fingers all over it.
Baby, come on now.

Hello.
<i>Hey, Tasha. It's Dre.</i>

Oh, it's you.
What do you want?

I was thinking it was a pretty nice day
today. Maybe we could go to the park.

Didn't I just see you yesterday?
<i>Yeah, but you know</i>...

Hello.
<i>Yo, Cisco.</i>

Tome? A.J. said
you got arrested, man.

<i>I did.</i>
Aw, damn. Hey, man, where you at?

Don't worry about all that right now.
I need you to do something for me.

<i>Go to Dre's backyard and get a brown</i>
<i>paper bag I put in his trash can.</i>

Brown paper bag?
What it look like?

What you mean,
what does it look like?

It's a paper bag. It's brown.
It's made of paper.

It got $20,000 in it.
You got $20,000 in a brown paper bag?

Man, you got to give me
half or something.

When you get it, take it to your house.
I should be out in a few hours.

All right, man. Cool.

Yeah.
Phone check, punk.

Handle that for me, man.
I'll get back to you. Bye.

Mother...

Hey, Boom, didn't I tell your ass...
Boom? Oh, it's like that.

Boom was in the back...
Man, whatever. Whatever, man.

Don't ask, don't tell.
You got my mail?

Yeah. Here you go.
Give me my damn mail.

You didn't read
my shit again, did you?

Nah, nah.
Your stuf<i>f'</i>s boring.

But I might start
reading it soon.

Fat...

Oh, okay.
Finally. The check.

'Bout time.

<i>Get it, player</i>
<i>Get it, player</i>

<i>Get it, player</i>
<i>Get it, player</i>

<i>Get it, player, get it, player</i>
Break it down.

Take that down there. Y'all in front
of my house. Take it down there.

You know what, man?
You need to get some color.

I know you ain't talking about color,
with your blotchy-face ass.

Hey, brother,
I know you ain't laughing.

Your big brother called,
said he want his shirt back.

Dre, I know
you ain't baggin'...

with your old skinny ass.
I know you ain't talking about skinny.

Look like you bench-pressing backwards
Get off me, you old freak.

Dre, come here, man!

Your boyfriend's calling.

Watch your mouth with that boyfriend
stuff. I'll knock out the front.

Man, watch the teeth.
He's right about your teeth.

What's up, man?
What's up?

What you doing
hanging out with them bums?

I ain't hanging out with them. I'm
trying to get them away from my house.

They're lowering my property value.
If you got beef with them cats...

just say the word.
I will beat their ass my damn self.

Okay? Look at Slim.

All of them.
Losers, man.

You still going to the block party?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Guess what. I got a little
something something in the mail today.

What?
Come by later. I'll let you know.

Come on, dog. I'll tell you later on.
All right.

I'm about to whup some ass right now.
Handle your business.

Hey, show me
how you do it.

Y'all still here?
I done told y'all, man...

y'all need to move down.
Man, you don't own this property.

I own this foot that I'm gonna
put in your ass if y'all don't move.

Nobody scared of you, Dre.
First of all...

you need to get
a chest for that shirt.

So now move.
Forget you, man.

Move. Move.

Move.

Hey, Dre, you kinda punk,
you know that?

Move. There's a job application
out there waiting for y'all.

Four of'em.

Ignorant mother... Why...
I hate this. I hate this.

Why is everybody
in Dre's trash can?

What you talking about "everybody"?
First it was Dre, now it's you.

What's the deal, Cisco?

Dre was in these trash cans?
Hello. I just said that, didn't I?

I guess you're not listening to me.
Oh, man.

Then you must think
I'm some damn fool or something.

Don't even answer that.
What's the deal, Cisco?

Could you keep a secret, man?
Yes, I can keep a secret.

'Cause last Thursday Miss Geraldine
had a big ol' thing on her hip...

she fell off
and burnt her ass up.

If you can keep this secret,
I'm gonna keep you in on this.

I'll cut you a little of the money.
Mon...

Oh, yes. Mum's the word. I'm cool
with it. What's up? How much is it?

I swear to God, if you tell anybody,
it's gonna be your ass.

You got my word.
What's up? What's the deal?

My cousin took a bag of money
and put it in one of these trash cans.

But it ain't here right now.
I think Dre might have taken it.

What makes you think
your cousin ain't got the money?

'Cause he ain't no thief.
He don't be stealing like that.

So why he hide it
back here?

I don't know. But I think
he took without even asking.

How am I supposed to...
Hey, hey, man!

What are y'all doing back here?
Nothin', man.

Well, you need to take y'all
doing-nothin' asses out my backyard.

Fool, I done told you once.
You better get gone.

Man, get off my fence.
Man, you crazy?

Go on, Boom.
I like your shirt.

Man! Damn!

<i>69.9 KNUT, the station</i>
<i>all in your mouth.</i>

<i>PJ. Butter. We found the suspect who</i>
<i>took the money from the armored truck.</i>

<i>But he don't got the money. We got</i>
<i>some missing money out there, y'all.</i>

<i>If you find it, why don't you break</i>
<i>me off a little something something...</i>

<i>and maybe I'll take you in my limo</i>
<i>to the block party, all right?</i>

<i>Till then, bump your head to this.</i>
<i>Break ya neck.</i>

<i>69.9 KNUT,</i>
<i>the station in your mouth.</i>

So, how's your
situation going?

Dolores?
Yeah.

Got a call
from her lawyer.

She wants the car,
the house and $1,200 a month.

That's bullshit!
And she wants full custody of Bret.

That's why I told myself
I'll never get married.

It costs too much.

You know, I hear black women
don't do their men like that.

Who's planning on
marrying a black woman?

You know,
if we find that money...

there's no way
they can trace it.

What are you saying?
Those are all deposits.

Those companies are insured. That money
means nothing to them in the long run.

I wonder how much
it really is.

I heard it's more
than we make in a month.

One man's loss,
another man's gain?

Huh? You thinking
what I'm thinking?

Yeah?

Doughnuts?

Let's just get
something to eat.

Man, what you mean don't worry
about it? Get my stuff back.

<i>Should be out ofhere</i>
<i>in a couple ofhours.</i>

Cool, man. I'm gonna
get started on it right now.

Keep that on the down,
all right?

All right, cool, man. Cool.

Motherfuck...

Aim.

What you want?
Tibbs, man, sit your nosy ass down.

Ain't nothing happening over here.
Don't tell me to sit my ass down.

I've been living here
all my life.

I've been here
since before you was born.

Get your ass in the house.
Get away.

I'll put a buckshot in your ass.
What's up, dog?

What's going on?
So, what's the news?

Pull up a chair.

Come on now. You got to tell me.
Pull up a chair.

That's bangin' right there.
All right, I'm listening. What's up?

Well, I just got
my insurance check.

That's what was in the envelope?
I'm trying to do something tonight.

How much you get?
Don't worry about all that now.

What, you get more than a "G"?
Yep.

More than two G's?
Yep.

More than three G's?
Partner, don't worry about all that.

You're the one volunteering information.
What you trying to do tonight?

Thinking about going to a strip club.
All right.

What's the move?
My car's still got a dent in it...

and I can't ride with no dented car.
Dre, my truck's riding smooth.

That's what I'm saying.
I figure this: You drive, I'll pay.

What time you trying to roll out?
'Bout 10:00?

All right. But you still trying
to go to the block party.

See, I don't know
about that, man.

If it's gonna be all kids,
I ain't trying to stay long, dude.

Meet me at my house
between 9:45, 10:00.

All right?
I'm good with that.

All right.

You get that for me, man?
Come on, Dre. I ain't your slave, man.

I ain't ask you all that.
You right by the door. Get the damn...

Get the damn door.

Hey, Mom, what you doing here?
Hey, baby.

What's going on?
All right.

Hey, Dre.
Is your mother home?

I know you fantasize about me.
Damn!

Oh, yes, ma'am.
She went to the mall. Yeah.

The mall.
Girl's always shopping. I'll go there.

Somebody called from Kelvin's school
What did they want?

They didn't say. They just said
they needed to talk to you ASAP.

So it's probably
'cause he messed up in school again.

Lord, I'm about to send
that boy to his father.

Hey, baby, look here.
Nice, isn't it? Huh?

Yeah, Ma. This is nice the first time
you showed me. I saw this already.

Oh, Lord, a two-week cruise
across the Mediterranean Sea.

Soon as I get some money, I'm gonna take
this trip. What was the number today?

I don't know, Ma.
If I hit that number, I'm gonna go...

with your mama.

My mama already got...
She already got her ticket.

Yeah, I know. She told me. That's all
right, 'cause I'm going on this trip.

Ma, look, if anybody deserves
to go on that trip, you do.

Thank you, baby.
Listen, darling.

Help your brother with his homework.
I got an appointment at the salon.

Come on now. The fool never gonna
pass the math class anyway.

What's the point?
Look here.

You know if he passes this test Friday,
he gonna graduate junior high.

Now, don't you know that?
He should've been studying instead...

of talking to them girls
on the phone all week.

Would you just watch
your brother?

Ma, he's old enough to watch himself.
Besides, I had plans to go out tonight.

Oh, really?
I thought you were broke...

when I asked you for $20.

What's up with that? Huh?

Can I talk to you outside
for just a second, please? One minute?

See you, Andre.

Yo, man, don't be
looking at my mom's ass.

I ain't looking at her ass.
I saw you looking.

We're like family. You trippin'.
If we like family...

don't be looking
at my mom's ass.

I wasn't looking
at her ass.

Ma, why you trying to embarrass me
in front of my friend?

I thought you said
you didn't have any money.

I don't have any money,
but Dre just came into some big cash.

Oh, really?
Like a couple of thousand dollars.

Really?
Why you looking at me like that?

He wants to take me out to celebrate.
What time y'all leaving?

Around 10:00.
Well, I'll be back way before you go.

I got to get my hair done. So you just
help your brother with his homework.

I've been watching him all week.
Here he is right now.

Hi, baby.
Hey, Ma.

I'll holler
at you later, man.

Bye, Ma.

Mom said you're gonna help me
with my math homework.

Man, you get on my damn nerves.
What?

Who need a cut?
I'll hook you up.

What's up, bro?
You need a cut?

How about you, man?
Nah. I'm waiting on somebody.

Who you waitin' on?
Anybody but your ass.

You better sit down,
you old NBA look-alike wanna-be.

Lucky I got a bunion.
What's up with you?

How about you, man?
I know you need a cut.

Man, who did your shit?
I did my shit, man.

Look at you. You got me saying it.
Man, look at my hair!

You want the do of the Millennium, you
better ask somebody. Look at that.

Huh? Yeah. You better ask.
Ah, ah, ah, ah. Huh?

Hey. What's
the latest, Twan?

Girl, haven't you heard?
About what?

About the armored
truck crash.

Somebody grabbed a couple
of bundles of money...

and when they found the suspect,
he didn't have a dime on him.

When?
Today.

And since the deposits
were just made...

they won't know
how much until Monday.

And the best part about it is,
that money is untraceable.

Come on. Who told you that?
It was on the news.

Get out!
And guess where it happened.

Where?
A couple of blocks from your house.

Well, I heard the guy stashed
the money in Andre Mitchell's backyard.

Where you get that at?
Boom.

You know Boom
don't know shit.

Don't be talking
about my Boom.

Bitch, please.
I got your bitch.

You may have my bitch,
but you ain't got Boom.

No, I got Boom, and he's at home looking
at my white chocolate ass every night.

You know it's true, girl.
You need to be trying to get an ass.

I don't think so.
Hey, excuse me.

Can we get on
with my hair, please?

I'm sorry, baby.
Everything as usual, right?

Yeah.

If I had that money,
I'd be on a cruise somewhere.

Get up out of here.

I don't have any money,
but Dre just came into some big cash.

Oh, really?
He got a couple of thousand dollars.

<i>Thousand dollars,</i>
<i>thousand dollars.</i>

Are you sure?
That's what his cousin said.

Are you sure?
That's what his cousin said.

But how you know his cousin
ain't lying though?

That's why the police
was over here.

Oh. You know what?

I think I'm gonna give my Dre baby
a call, see how he's doing.

You know how the police get.
Could you pass me the phone?

Go on, girl. You so...

Give me the phone.
I know you was looking.

I wasn't looking
at your old tired booty.

Call my baby Dre.

Hello.
Hey, Dre, baby. How you doing?

Who this?
Tasha.

<i>Who?</i>
It's me, Tasha.

I need you to come over
my house soon as possible.

<i>It's an emergency. I have</i>
<i>to talk to you, right now.</i>

What emergency?
Please, Dre. Baby, please.

All right.
Okay, I'll see you later.

All right, Tasha.

Here. Hang that up
for me, please.

Look at you.
Look at you.

Boom, you know what? You're gonna have
to leave 'cause I got some things to do.

What you about to do?
Handle my business.

You know how I do it, girl.
See, girl, you ain't even right.

You ain't even right.
But you better give me some though.

You know I'm gonna give you some.
You my girl. I always look out for you.

Okay, maybe not that time
I didn't have your back.

But I got you

I'm gonna call you later.
Just go on. I'm gonna call you.

Yeah, whatever.
You stressin' me.

But anyway, I'll holler at you later.
All right then.

Hey, what's up, Dre?
What's going on, player?

Where my money at, Cisco?
That's why I came over... to pay you.

What I owe you, about 5, $10?
You owe me $20, man.

You lucky I didn't
charge you interest in two years.

My fault, man. Things be coming up.
You know how it is, man.

You a good brother, though.
Helping the needy out.

What's going on?
Whoo! Dang, man.

What you looking for?
You got a new love seat, a new couch.

That's old, dude.
That furniture's old. I been had that.

That's old?
Yes.

The shirt is tight. What's that, large?
Dude, dude, it's old too.

All this is old.
Everything in here is old.

Just like your outfit. The same thing.
Just as old as your stuff is.

Hey, man, since you always be
hooking me up and looking out for me...

it's my turn, you know,
to return the favor, baby.

You know what I'm saying?
Whatever.

What the hell is that?
This is a joint, baby.

Ajoint?
Yeah, straight from Jamaica.

Go on and smell a little bit.
How high are you trying to get?

This is the best shit
money can buy, dog.

You don't want none of this? You sure?
No, I'm cool. Yes, I'm cool.

I'm gonna break you off
a piece of the roach for later on.

Dude, I'm cool. I'm cool.
You don't want none?

Thank you. Go, Cisco.
You positive?

All right. Hey, you got
a lighter I could borrow, man?

Man, just go. Go.

I'm gonna smoke this by myself.
You missing out. All right, Dre.

Freak.

<i>It's PJ. Butter, giving you</i>
<i>the hottestjoints in your mouth.</i>

<i>Hey, the money</i>
<i>is still out there. Believe me.</i>

<i>Hey, stop blowing me up. I told you,</i>
<i>the money is still out there.</i>

<i>Look at you. It's like Easter in</i>
<i>the hood. You trying to find this cash.</i>

<i>Break me off if you get it,</i>
<i>all right? Holler.</i>

<i>69.9 KNUT,</i>
<i>the station in your mouth.</i>

Hey, Dre! Just the man
I've been looking for, brother.

Dre! My man!

Just the man I've been looking for.
What's up, Too Sweet?

I've been watching you
for a minute now.

And I know
you got a job...

but I think you're ready to make
some serious money, my brother.

How, Too Sweet?
I notice the way you handle people.

And that's a quality
everybody don't have.

It takes a special kind
of individual, brother.

So I'm that individual?
Yeah. You damn right.

Too Sweet knows quality
when he sees it.

Look at me.
What is that? Rat fur or something?

It's rat and possum, brother.
You don't find this everywhere.

You would have found it on the freeway.
Freeway, my ass.

Princess, come here, baby.
Come, come, come.

Oh, shit.
You like this?

Yeah. Turn
that ass around, baby.

Damn.

Is that straight or what?
That's nice.

Because if you don't like that,
I got all types, brother.

Light. Bright.
Damn near white.

Dark. Midnight. Fat.

Oh, my bad. You can't
call them "fat" no more.

It's bad
for their self-esteem.

Now you got to call them ho's
"pleasingly plump."

I don't know.
You don't know?

All right, all right.
You making me reach into my...

my secret stash.

I didn't wanna blow
your mind with this one...

but... Passion! Passion!

Come on, girl.
Oh, shit.

Yeah. My baby.

Motherfucker,
where's my shit?

Baby, don't trip.
I got your shit.

Passion, don't get out of pocket
in front of a potential investor.

Hey there, sugar.

You looking for some spice?

Come on, baby. You think
you can handle this?

I'm just saying...
I'm just...

Hey, don't let the size
fool you, honey.

'Cause you know what?
I'd pop your cork.

I would tear
that ass up.

I don't know.
I don't know.

He ain't
'bout it, 'bout it.

I'll talk to you a little later,
you hear, honey?

Sweet, you better have
my shit when I get back.

Like that, Sweet?
She punk you like that?

Yeah. Hey, I told you
I got all types, didn't I?

Yeah, you wasn't
lying, dog.

A lot of folks
would pay, my brother.

Man, I'm not paying for her.
I don't want you to pay for her.

I want you to work it. Make them ho's
make money for you, brother.

They don't wanna
work for me.

Princess, baby,
would you work for him?

Wait now. Don't start nothin'.
Hell, yeah.

I told you. I'm getting too old
for this young man's game.

I wanna pass my empire over
to someone who can make them dollars...

and you have what it takes.

You think so?
You wanna make $20,000 a week, brother?

Man, you ain't make
$20,000 a week.

I know, but if
we work together, we can make it.

What the hell you need from me?
A couple of dollars for more ho's.

What does a couple of dollars mean?
About $10,000.

Ten thousand...
Man, are you out your damn mind?

Too knows you just got
some money, brother.

Man, I ain't spending
no money on no ho's.

You can make mo' money
off of ho money.

Well, you need to spend yo' money
'cause I ain't got no money.

Oh, it's like that, huh?

It's exactly like that.
Baby, let's get the hell out of here.

I thought this fool had potential.
Take you and your rat coat...

havin' ass up out of here.
I've stole you money.

I bought you your first pair of shoes.
This is class, man. My jacket is class.

Fix your damn muffler.
Fix the muffler.

Cracker?
Nigger!

I just wanted to know
if you wanted a cracker.

I'm very
stressed out, Lewis.

I'm sorry.

No offense taken.

Thanks.
I like the crackers.

<i>Your boy, PJ. Butter.</i>

<i>Let me get on up out ofhere and go try</i>
<i>to find me some of this missing money.</i>

<i>But don't you go nowhere 'cause up next</i>
<i>we got my man for all you ladies.</i>

<i>He gonna make you wet. He gonna</i>
<i>make you take off your panties.</i>

<i>He gonna make you do things</i>
<i>you never thought you could do.</i>

<i>Tooth is up next on 69.9 KNUT,</i>
<i>the station in your mouth.</i>

Goddamn!
Damn, where the fuck am I?

Hey, bro! My main man!
What's happening?

I locked my keys in my car.
Come on. Let me show you.

I was thinking. I wondered
if you could, you know...

you know, you could...
You know what I'm talking about.

I could get in there for you.
Yes.

Hey, and there's
$5.00 in it for you.

Really, homie?
Let me get this right.

If I help you get those keys out,
I can have that $5.00 bill?

You sure can, homie.

Okay, homie.
Hold on one second, okay?

Goddamn motherfucker!

You broke my window!

Thanks, homie.

You broke my window!
This is a company car!

Goddamn! What am I
fucking doing here?

I could be in
fucking Beverly Hills!

This is Tooth coming to you live,
KNUT 68.9 on your FM dial...

<i>on your lunch hour.</i>

<i>Yes, indeed,</i>
<i>we got the hottest tracks.</i>

<i>Speaking ofhot, this morning</i>
<i>an armored truck turned over...</i>

<i>and a gang of money</i>
<i>is now missing.</i>

Come on in, Dre, baby.

What's the emergency, Tasha?
I just wanted to see you, that's all.

You saw me yesterday.

I know. But I was thinking.
We should spend more time together.

Are you high?
You know I stopped doing that.

Stop playing.

No, see, that's my mom's medication,
for her eyes and stuff. She's...

Damn near blind?

Dre, you are too silly.
Come on. I wanna show you something.

Sit down.
Sit right there.

Okay? Don't... Don't...

No time to be playing, Tasha.

I bought something,
and I need someone's opinion.

Why me? When you saw me yesterday,
you said you didn't wanna see me again.

I was just playing.

I guess you was playing
when you shot at me too.

Dre, you take stuff a little
too serious. Lighten up, baby.

Plus, they were just blanks.

Come on, Tasha.
What do you want?

It's from Victor's
Trashy Secrets.

What do you think?

It's all right.
All right?

I know I'm the bomb.

Ooh, yeah, baby.

What's my name? What's my name?
What's my name?

Yeah, you like that.

Yeah!
You like that.

Yeah, Dre.

I wanna do things to you
you never had done...

to you before.
Damn, Tasha.

Hell, yeah.

Hey, hey, hey!
Go get the condom, baby.

Oh. That shit.
Back it out.

Okay. Stay right there, baby.
Can't afford it. All right.

Damn.

Okay. Here you go.

But hold this for me.
I got to tee-tee. Be right back.

Yeah, you know I still
wear these big ones.

Excuse me. Sorry.

I'm ready, baby. Yeah.

But didn't you just go in the...

Damn.

Shit.

Ooh, yes, Dre!

Aw, hell, no.

God. That's it?

Huh?

Two minutes?

I got... I just got
a lot on my mind.

A lot on your mind?
You little...

I'm sorry, baby.

I know it's hard to perform
when you have so much on your mind.

Just tell me what's
on your mind, baby.

I'm getting like a weird vibe
from everybody.

Really?

Yeah.

You know, baby,
if you ever, ever need me...

all you have
to do is ask, okay?

I'm here for you, baby.

Same here, Tasha.

For real?

Yeah.

Tasha, what's wrong, baby?
It was that good?

I never had no one
who was down for a bitch.

You know
I'm down for a bitch.

I wanna get an abortion,
but I can't afford it.

How much is it, Tasha?

I promise, as soon as I get
the money, I'll pay you back, baby.

Tasha, you ain't
got no job.

But as soon as I get one,
you'll be the first person I pay.

Please.
I almost got enough.

How much
you need, Tasha?

Two thousand dollars.
Two thousand dollars? Damn!

How many years you pregnant?
I'm two months.

But it costs more the first time
you get pregnant, Dre.

You might have to wait till you about
nine months. I ain't got it like that.

It's like that?
Tasha, I just ain't got it right now.

I heard
you got some money.

Is this what this shit is about?
Is this what...

I got plans for
that money already.

Whatever.

Dre, you know what?

You ain't shit!
I wasn't pregnant anyway.

I just wanted to see what your
little stupid ass was gonna say.

You little stupid-ass motherfucker.
Whatever.

I wasn't little a few minutes ago.
Get your tired ass out my bed.

I don't wanna see
your stupid ass again. Get out!

I'm gone.

Okay. Dre, baby.
Come on.

You just gonna do me like that?
Move out the way, please.

I don't hit no girl.

Oh, you gonna stay there?

Get your crazy ass
out of here.

Oh, I got something
for your ass.

It's on now.

Give me this. Hold on.
Did you just dick-slap me?

You simple ass... I had just enough
of your shit. You got a problem.

Don't ever raise your dick
at me again. You understand me?

Simple ass.

Simple. You know what? Open this damn
door. That damn shit should be black.

Listen. This is me. This is me.
<i>Me?</i>

<i>Me who?</i>
Stay out of everybody's business.

Just mind your own.
<i>Oh, it's like that?</i>

That's... Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. Yello.

Dre ain't trying to come off of no
money, but I got something for his ass.

Hold on for one second.
Hold on.

Listen. I gots to go. But first
of all, mind your own business.

Secondly,
I'll call you back. Bye.

Hello. Okay,
girl, what's up?

Oh, you gonna hear about it, girl.
<i>What's the matter?</i>

Oh, it's on. I'm gonna call you later.
<i>You need to tell me what's up</i>...

Ooh, it's gonna be on.

It's gonna be on like
hot butter popcorn up in here soon.

Hold up!

Keep knocking.

I said hold up!

Hold...

Who the hell's
knocking like that?

Man, who the hell
is doing this?

Oh, shit. Damn.

They probably in there hiding.
Knock harder!

It's like that? Y'all wanna play like
that? It's about to be really on now.

Whoa. Damn.

Ooh, Jehovah!

Come on, ladies. We got to go.
That brother's been blessed.

Wait a minute.
What's the address in here?

Y'all ain't got to go.
Come on in.

My house is available
for everybody.

I bet you won't
come back again.

Get in... Get inside,
you big perv.

Don't do me
like that, man. Come on, man.

Whatever, whatever.
Hey, fellas.

New meat.
Don't... Man...

And he's got little beef.

Mm-hmm. You better
watch your shoes, fool.

I'm crazy.

You ain't crazy.
You wanna see crazy?

You wanna see crazy?
Step off!

All right.
Quiet down in there!

You touched Ivory. Hello.

Hello. Can you hear me?
Shit.

Getting hungry.

You ever had
your salad tossed?

Yeah. I can go
for one of them right now.

Stop it.
You like it plain or with something?

I need something on it.
It don't taste right when it's plain.

A little added flavor.
I know what you mean. I like honey.

Oh, you like that Chinese style.
A little sweet and sour?

Strictly vinaigrette.
Italian.

When was the last time
you had your salad tossed?

Last night.
Who did it for you?

Tossed my salad?
Yeah.

I did.
You did?

Oh, you limber like that.

Yeah, I know how I like it.
I know how to mix it all up.

Get all into it.
Just get into it. Just get into it.

Who did it for you last?

My mom.
She likes doing it too.

Your mom? Man, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

What the hell's
wrong with you?

I don't let her cut my meat.
Man, you are fucking sick!

He's fucking sick, man!
He's fucking sick! He's fucking sick!

It's a salad. It's healthy for you.
That shit ain't healthy.

What the fuck's
wrong with you?

I wanna tell y'all
brothers something. I love you, man.

Y'all my dogs.

I don't know what I'd do without y'all.
Coons.

Are you ready
to speak jigaboo?

Absolutely.

I love you, man.

Man, go on with that bullshit.
What the hell is you doing?

Pouring some for the homies not here.
Man, we here.

Look at this. Five-0 coming over here.
What?

Hi there, fellas.

What's up?

I wonder if you've heard anything about
the armored truck crash this morning.

Nah, dog.
What you mean, "Nah"?

This y'all's hood. Y'all should
know what's going on around here.

Well, we don't recall...

hearing of any incident
of that nature...

occurring in this vicinity.

That's kind
of strange, isn't it?

If someone made off with $100,000,
someone would've heard something.

There's a big reward in it.

Reward? Like the reward gonna
be more than the money.

How about five years in prison?
How's that sound to you?

Ooh, that sounds cool.
This the hood, man.

The best thing that can happen
to you is to get locked up.

That's for sure for sure.
I'll run you in for public drinking.

Drinking? Since when
is it against the law...

to drink juice
in public?

Have some?
That's real funny.

We will be
patrolling the area.

Don't fuck up!

Don't be caught in anything stupid
you might regret it.

Like helping y'all
non-dressing asses.

That's why I can't stand niggers.
Me neither.

What?
Tango and Ash.

<i>This is Tooth coming</i>

What's wrong with homeboy?
I wouldn't even mess with him.

Sometimes he forget
he even in a wheelchair.

Oh, it's like that?
Yeah.

What the hell you in here for?
Jaywalking, fool.

Probably rolled up
on some fools.

Supposed I rolled over there

One. Five.
6:00. 4:00. Twelve.

Diggs, can I talk
to you for a second?

But you ain't got my money, man.
What you messin' with me for?

Huh? You need to be out
robbing a liquor store or something.

You got 5 hours
and 14 minutes.

That's what I wanna
talk to you about, the money.

This better not be
no bullshit, man.

This ain't no bullshit.
This shit is real, man.

I got a partner who helped me get
the money, but he ain't home right now.

We're hooking up at the block party.
Who's your partner?

I ain't trying to get him
all caught up in this shit, all right?

By the looks of this shit, he's already
in it. You better not be playing me.

If you don't believe me, you're
welcome to come to the block party.

I think I got another invitation.
I can come to the party?

Oh, that's so nice.
Don't tell me where I can come.

I know I can come to the party.
Where's the party?

You got until midnight.
If I don't see some cash by midnight...

that's your ass,
and you too, stupid.

All right then. We out then.
What are you waiting on?

Get the fuck out of my face.
Man, he gonna kill us.

I don't wanna die.
Why didn't you tell him the truth?

If I told him the truth, he'd try to
get it, and I still would've owed him.

This way we got
a chance to get it.

Andre Mitchell.

What?

Get your little sorry ass up.
Come on. Let's go.

Hurry up!
Hey, man! Don't be tacky.

Leave that boy alone. Come on.
He's after me.

Whatever.
I told you she be lyin'.

Now, look. She dropped
all the charges, okay?

Got me in here with all
these fuckin' freaks, man!

Don't worry about it.
Hey, listen to me.

First, you might need to go down to
the clinic and get yourself checked out.

For real?
Anybody in contact with that woman...

is subject to have an STD.
Oh, shit.

Goddamn!

Did you have fun?

What?

Hey, don't let the gray hairs
fool you, man.

Don't trip.
I'm just hangin' out.

Came to see
who got some shit.

Oh, hell, no!

I got a little cough.
Cough.

Pulled my back.
You know.

Workin' out.
Your ass don't ever work out.

What do you have? And don't give me
that cold bullshit either.

I don't know.
You don't know.

Is the problem below your waist
and above your knee?

Yeah.

Have you had sex with
a skanky little ho lately?

Excuse me?
A ho.

A hootchie. A freak.
A crackhead.

I mean kinda.
What do you mean, "kinda"?

I mean, you know,
she don't smoke crack.

Well, then she's a ho.
She's a freak!

She's a hootchie!
Now just sign here!

Damn, lady, you need
to chill, miss, okay?

Yeah, chill. Where'd chillin' get you?
Sign that thing.

Lady, come on.
People listenin'.

Listening.
Sign it!

You got a problem. You know that?
Yeah, you got a problem.

You nasty little thing.
You infected little freak of nature!

You little nasty thing, you!
You're just nasty!

Comin' up here
and messing everything up.

So what you got?
I don't know.

Look, brother.
I don't want no trouble.

You keep it real with me,
I keep it real with you.

Like I'm sayin', I don't really know.
Clinic.

What's your symptoms?
What's wrong? What do you need?

Symptoms?
You itchin', scratchin', burnin'?

Oh, no, man. I'm all right.
I ain't got none of that kind of stuff.

Hurts like a mutha
when I pee.

Sorry to hear that, man.

No, don't be sorry for me.
See, I got discharge.

What the hell
you talkin' about?

See, the doctors,
they can see what I got.

But you... gotta get
the old Q-Tip.

Oh, you don't know
about the Q-Tip?

I don't know
about the Q-Tip.

Oh, see, that's when they get
a stick about this long...

and the head be
about this wide, man.

Then they grab your dick, man,
and they dig and dig!

And they dig!
Get back!

Back it up, dog. Don't crack the jaw
like that again. Don't do that.

Scared me.

You got a problem.
No, brother. I ain't got no problem.

See, I got symptoms.
You? You got the problem.

No, you got the problem
with that outfit.

Hey, don't worry about where I shop.
I got the burning!

I got the burning.
I got to see the doctor right now.

I've got the burning.
Just sign in.

Not with that hand!

Sorry.
I have the burning.

I've got the burning.

Just go sit down!

No, I can't sit with the people.
I got the burning.

Well, they've all got
the burning too. Go on!

No. That's how I got it.
I gotta see the doctor.

What are you doing here?
Who, me?

I'm waitin' on him.

Calm down, young man.
But, Doc...

You've got the burning.
I've got the burning.

Drop your drawers.

We'll give you
a little shot.

It'll be just fine.
Just fine.

I do a lot of these things,
and all of you guys are the same.

You wanna dance,
but you don't wanna pay the band.

You've got the burning!
I've got the burning!

Andre Mitchell?
Mm-hmm. Right there.

Doctor's ready to see you.
I ain't next.

They was here before me.
No, you're next. He's waiting.

Y'all know damn well
y'all was here before me.

And, Boom, you know damn well
you should be the first one.

They was there before me.
All of them was there before me.

Hey, what's up, Doc?

I'll be with you
in a second.

I always wanted to say,
"What's up, Doc?"

Very clever.
Why don't you hop up on the table.

There.
Now how can I help you?

I think I have an STD.

What are your symptoms?

I don't have any symptoms.

Well, then what makes
you think you have STD?

'Cause I was with a girl
who had an STD.

And what did she have?

I don't know.
They just said she had an STD.

Who are they?

Look. It's
a long story, Doc.

They just said it's best
if I get tested for everything.

All right.
Drop your drawers.

We'll take a little swab.
We'll send it in to the lab.

That way we'll know for sure
in just a couple of days.

You know what I say,
"Better safe than sorry."

See ya later.
Gotta go.

Gotta go.
Mm-mmm!

Good lookin' out, dog.

You comin' to the block party, man?
I might.

Hello.
You hear what's up with Tasha?

No. What happened?
<i>Man, she got an STD.</i>

And anybody that ever messed with her
is supposed to go down...

and report to the clinic
on 103rd.

<i>Yeah, I just came from there, man.</i>
<i>They tried to get me, but I'm cool.</i>

Hold on, man.

He honkin' like he crazy.
I'm gonna holler at you later, Kent.

All right, dog?
All right.

Man, what are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

I'm lookin' for a loaf of bread.
I'm hungry.

A loaf of bread? Yo, are you
purposely trying to irritate me?

Go sit down somewhere.

Go sit down!
Kiss my ass!

What's up, Dad?
Hey, boy.

Where's your mom?
She went shoppin'.

She'll be gone for
a couple hours, though.

That woman
always could shop.

Say, fool, cut that noise down.
Asshole!

How you been doing, son?
I'm cool as a fan.

How's your car?
Still got a dent in it.

Can't even open the trunk up.
You know.

When you gonna
fix that thing?

Oh, you know what?
I got an insurance check today.

You know, you can't date
no girl without no car.

You could if you stopped
dating them hootchies.

Come on, Dad.
I don't date no hootchies.

All girls are hootchies.

Oh, so what you saying,
Mom's a hootchie?

Oh, no.
Now your mom's a rarity.

She's got class.

Kind of crazy, but classy.

The rest of'em
are all freaks.

But don't men
make women freaks?

Now you're starting to sound
like your mother.

That's why we not together
till this day.

I thought it was 'cause you got
that little gambling problem.

Yeah, and I got a horse
comin' in any day now.

Dad, that's your problem.

You gotta curb your gambling problem.
I ain't got no problem.

That's your first problem is denying
that you have a problem, Dad.

Sound like
you've got some sense.

Must have taken that
from your mother.

I'm movin' out
next month, Dad...

and she's gonna
be here by herself.

I think she misses you too.

Hi, Mr. Mitchell.
Hey, Boom.

Got any pussy yet?

Oh, no, but I'm gonna keep tryin',
though. I'll let you know.

All right. You let me know
when you get some.

Yes, sir, for sure.
I sure will.

Dre, I need
to talk to you.

No. What you want, Boom?
Not in front of your daddy.

What are you two up to?

Oh, it ain't like that.
You better go on with that bullshit.

No, for real.
It's important.

That's what you get for opening up
other people's mail.

That's what you get,
fat bastard.

Well, I got things to do.

You'll let your mother know I came by.
Yes, sir.

Y'all take it easy.

It ain't like that, Dad, for real.
It ain't even like that.

Bye, Mr. Mitchell.
Bye, Boom.

You let me know now, hear?
Yes, sir.

What is it, Boom?

Dre, are we friends?
I don't know now.

What you just did around my father.
Don't ever do that, man.

Tasha's tryin' to set you up
'cause she heard you got some money.

She already tried. It didn't work.
Good.

Also, thank you, Dre.
For what?

You the only one around here who
don't say bad, mean things about me.

I mean, you all right, Boom.
You the only one who understands me.

It's like you've been in positions
I've been in before, you know?

I know a couple of positions
I ain't never gonna go to.

Stop. You so crazy.
Boom.

But thank you though.

All right, Boom.
Bye, Dre.

Hey, Boom.
Huh?

Why don't you come by
my house tomorrow at 3:00.

I got something for you.

At 3:00, Boom. At 3:00.

Okay.
All right. All right, Boom.

Boom, I'm cool with that.
Thanks, Dre.

Go ahead. No.
Go, Boom.

Bye, Boom.
See you.

Hey, Mrs. Anderson.
How you doin'?

My mom's not here right now.
She went to the mall.

I know. I made you
some brownies. Homemade.

That's nice, Mrs. Anderson.

Well, aren't you gonna
let me come in?

Oh, yeah, of course.

Mmm. I thought you might like
to try my brownies.

Ooh, I would love
to taste your brownies.

Would you really?
Hell, yeah!

Ever since my husband and I divorced,
I can't get anybody to try my brownies.

Should've asked me.

You are so sweet.

Not having a man around,
you know, it's really hard.

What about Kent?
Kent. Oh, well...

he's a good son, but I need
somebody there emotionally...

and financially.

I know that's right.
You know, Dre...

I have seen you grow up from
a little boy to a big old, strong man.

I bet you got a lot of young girls
chasing after you, don't you?

Well, you know, I gets mine,
Mrs. Anderson.

Oh, no, it's Brenda.

We're both adults,
aren't we?

Yeah.

I wanna show you something.

Really?
Really.

Let's go up to your room.

Oh, okay.
Okay.

If I'm dreamin',
I'm gonna be mad as hell.

Mmm. Lay down.

Wow! Mrs...

Dre.
Oh, shit!

I know you're not about
to bone my moms.

We're supposed to be
like family!

I love you.
Boom?

Boy, I taught you better than that.
Mom!

That's right. You call me Mommy,
and I'm gonna call you Poppy.

I can't, Mrs. Anderson.
I can't.

What's the matter, honey,
have you got a little problem?

Oh, no, ain't no problem
down there.

Hmm?
Uh-uh.

I mean, what,
you don't find me attractive?

You fine as hell!

Dre, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I came on to you.
It's just that...

I've been going through a lot
ever since I found out that...

Well, what's wrong?

The doctor said I've gotta
have a kidney operation...

or I'm not gonna live
another six months.

Kent ain't never tell me that.
That's because he doesn't know.

And I don't wanna worry him,
because I can't afford the operation.

How much is it?
About $4,000.

Damn, don't you got some insurance?
That is with insurance.

I don't know who to turn to.
If I knew somebody I could get a loan.

What about a bank?
The banks?

They won't help me.

I'm a little embarrassed
to say this, Dre...

but, well, Kent told me
that you came into some money recently.

It would just be a loan.
Just a loan.

How much you need, Mrs. Anderson?
Oh, just $4,000.

It would just be
a loan, honey. Hmm?

Hmm? Please, please.
Okay.

Oh! Oh, you are such
a sweet boy!

I'm sorry I came on
to you like that.

And remember,
I only have six weeks.

Oh, I thought
you said six months.

It was, when he told me that
41/2 months ago.

Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you so much.
Don't forget.

All right.
Thank you.

Oh, man!

This has been
the craziest day of my life.

I could make a movie
about this day.

I don't wanna go outside again.
I don't know what's next.

Dre, wake up!

Dre, do you know what time it is?
Oh, shit!

Are you hungry?
Do you want some supper?

No, ma'am.
I'm going to the block party...

and then I'm going
to the club afterwards.

Oh, okay.

This is what I'm saying.
I got my hat on. And it's like, whoo!

You sure you don't want
nothing to eat?

No, ma'am. I won't be out
too late, though.

All right. You be careful out there.
Yes, ma'am.

Hey, Pops.
Ooh, you is clean!

Is your mother home?

Yeah. Hey, Ma.
Mom, somebody's here to see you. Ma!

Who is it, Dre?
George.

Carol, I thought
you might like these.

They're beautiful.
Not as beautiful as you.

Ooh, now that was smooth, Pops.
I like that.

That is real, son.

See, Ma. Now you have someone
to eat dinner with.

Would you like to come in?

I'd love to.

I see ya, beige boy.

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Tooth on KNUT, 68.9.

I am so tired right now,
I'm drooling on myself.

I have been here since 9:00 in the
morning getting prepared for this day.

I can't find anybody to replace me.
I'm playing songs.

People been calling me
about this money.

It's about time for me
to sign up outta here.

What I'm gonna do right now is go
to this block party I heard about.

It's supposed to be off the hook.
Look, if you find the money...

<i>come down to the block party,</i>
<i>spend the money well.</i>

All I'm sayin', the party
better be off the hook.

Look, if it's wack, we just hop
in the truck and go to the strip club.

All I'm saying is the party
better be off the hook.

You better be right.
I'm serious.

I was telling you about this house.
Diggs is on my ass, man.

Hi. May I help you?
Hi. Is Dre home?

Oh, no, baby,
you just missed him.

I believe he went
to a block party.

Oh, that's right. Okay.
Well, thanks a lot.

All right.
Who shall I say came by?

Tell him that Diggs came by.
Diggs.

Okay.

I heard Boom gonna be there too.
What?

Well, you know it's gonna be
off the hook if that fool is there.

Man, I don't want
the burnt one.

You don't want the burnt one?
I'll give you any one you want.

Take off that sweater. How about that?
Whatever.

What's crackin' over here?

Hey there, dog.
Oh, man.

Oh, what's up, dog? All right,
What's up, dog?

You know what?
Kelvin ran out the house...

when I was on the phone with you.
Your brother gonna be there?

Ooh, I am just
hot and sweat...

Oh, no. See, I don't like to come
to no parties stinkin' like this.

I gots to go home
and change my clothes.

What's up, man?

I want a half a bird, man.
A half a bird, dog.

You got to talk to my cousin.
He'll be out in a week.

There's about three future baby mamas
up in here tonight, boy.

If you had some rhythm,
maybe you'd be gettin' some.

That's messed up, man.
You know I got a clubfoot.

Man, she is fine over there.
Yo, man, you seen Dre?

I haven't seen Dre all night, man.
Hey, man, whatcha gonna do...

when Diggs finds out you ain't
got that money you owe him?

Oh, what you mean what I'm gonna do?
You mean, what are we gonna do?

What you mean "we"?
We in this together, or did you forget?

No, that was your $20,000
you found and put in Dre's backyard.

I had nothing to do with that.
But if I had the money now in my hand...

who's money would it be?
We're cousins. We'd split it.

Exactly. Shut up, man.
Look for Dre.

What's up? What's up, guys?
You got my money?

Big Dre, what's up, man?

Oh, what, we can't stand
here neither, man?

I don't care if y'all stand here, as
long as you're not in front of my house.

Oh, and speaking of in front
of my house, have y'all noticed...

there's been some cops
in front of my house all day today?

Probably lookin' for that crazy fool
Tome. Heard he stashed some money.

Whoa, what money? I didn't hear.
You didn't hear?

Tome robbed an armored truck today
after it crashed earlier.

They say he stashed
the money somewhere.

Yeah, they said he put it in somebody's
trash can. Can't find it though.

But the cops have been chasing
that fool all day around here, man.

Yeah, whatever. On the real, Diggs say
he's looking for whoever got his money.

Man, y'all know Tome didn't
stash that damn money.

He too cheap to let some money
out of his sight for a second.

Somebody got that $20,000
somewhere.

I heard
you got some money.

Too know you just got
some money, brother.

Kent told me you came into some money
recently. It would just be a loan.

Cisco is your man, all right?
'Cause I got your back, man.

Other than the fact that I ain't got
the money, and the plane ticket's $600.

What the hell you doing back here?
Nothin'!

Get your ass
up out my backyard!

Find the money, man.

You said Boom has
something to do with it.

There goes Dre right there.
Dre, come here!

My backyard!
Backyard?

What the hell? Oh!

Killin' me!

Whoa!
Give me my motherfuckin' money!

I don't know where your money at, man.
You know where the money is.

Would I be back here
if I knew where the money was?

Don't play stupid!
I'll beat your ass.

** Dre gots the money ****
Cut it, Boom.

You got the money?
It was in your backyard all the time?

Give the drag queen my money.
Have her bring it over here right now.

I ain't got time to play
with you motherfuckers.

Do you hear me, huh?
Give me my money, man! Shit!

Drop the gun, asshole. Drop the gun.
What's up with you, man?

You stupid fucks. We knew you'd
lead us right to the money.

Give it up, jiggas.
Jiggas, give it up.

Give up the money. Give up the money
so we can get out of here...

and get on vacation.
That suit you got is jiggas.

Steal the money like I stole the rest.
Freeze! Freeze!

Drop the gun, tough guy.

Officers, you have it all wrong here.
You're all wrong. Listen.

You gotta let me go. Hey, whatcha doin'?
Let me go, Officer.

Detective, let me...
Discrimination, goddamn it!

Go, go.
It's my yard, man.

You go, man. You have the money.
What are you talking about?

I live here.
Go on through. Go. Go!

I knew I shouldn't have
went to that party.

Go, man. Go! Go!
What? What?

Boom?
Is the coast clear?

Get up and go.
Get up!

Take them shoes
with you too.

But...
Boom! Go. Pull your pants up.

I see the crack of your ass
hangin' all out, man.

Who's the asshole now?
You racist bastard!

Bad old little kids. Excuse me. Where
is the man with the leather jacket?

We need to take you downtown.
Yo, baby shit!

Yeah! Surprise!

Oh, I'm sorry. Huh?

Tomorrow we need to take you
downtown and ask you some questions.

Oh, yeah, all right.

I need you to sign here.

<i>Whoo</i>- <i>wee.!</i>
<i>Man, what a day.</i>

<i>Well, those cops,</i>
<i>they got arrested.</i>

<i>My mom and pops, man, they got</i>
<i>back together, so that's all good.</i>

<i>And nobody</i>
<i>got with Tasha anymore.</i>

<i>And the homeless man?</i>
<i>Well, he got away with the money.</i>

<i>I couldn't snitch on him. So I guess</i>
<i>everybody got what they wanted.</i>

<i>And when I say, "Everybody got</i>
<i>what they wanted, "I mean everybody.</i>

No!

<i>You know I was good.</i>

<i>You know I was good.</i>

I just wanted to know if you...

You know what?
You were right.

School is more important.

No, I ain't seen...
Why don't you ask Boom?

I mean,
why don't you ask Slim?

Shit, I already asked Slim.

Shut the fuck up!

Hi, Dre.
Hey... I fucked up.

Twenty dollars, man.
Give me my twenty dollars.

You take credit cards, man.
Cut!

Dre! Hey, Dre! Come on!

Not as wonderful as you.
Cut that shit down!

Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut.

Wow, we have an "S-S..."
Oh, we keep on going.

Oh, we forgot the "B."

Perfect.
