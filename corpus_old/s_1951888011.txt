1 
I did everything I could, 
but the bank does not understand. 

2 
If we do not have the 50 thousand U.S. dollars 
payment within 7 days ... 

3 
... lose the workshop. 

4 
Can I really do that? 

5 
There's me, is the bank. 

6 
You are the bank, Warner. 

7 
How am I? The truth is that only 
manage small accounts. 

8 
If I give you another extension, 
I said goodbye. 

9 
You can find another job ... 

10 
... but this workshop is irreplaceable. 

11 
Do we really expect 
sacrifice my career for you? 

12 
What you do if you really interested. 

13 
You know that if ... 

14 
... but I did all I could. 

15 
Sorry, Katie. 
It's nothing personal. 

16 
Everything about this workshop, 
is personal for me. 

17 
My father built it, 
my brother died for him ... 

18 
... is not only the workshop, Warner. 

19 
Perhaps this is a problem. 

20 
Then ... 

21 
-- How did it go with the bank? 
-- Very good. 

22 
It impressed by 
my business plans ... 

23 
... and seduced by my charms. 

24 
Already established a plan 
Pay with them. 

25 
I thought we'd done 
So last month. 

26 
And I did it again this month. 

27 
Listen ... boys 
are hungry. 

28 
So I think it would be a good idea ... 

29 
... if we do we bring 
a couple of pizzas. 

30 
It is an excellent idea, Charlie. 

31 
Let's have fun with 
the boy pizzas. 

32 
I do not understand that 
is so annoying, officer. 

33 
Detective. 

34 
And the sidewalk is where 
people walk ... 

35 
... there is where 
van cars. 

36 
That's why we call streets. 

37 
There were many cars in the middle, 
that's why I decided to use the sidewalk. 

38 
Pudo having killed someone. 

39 
If. I needed to do 
either something stupid. 

40 
So I do a big favour, 
making me a fine. 

41 
Tómalo how ... natural selection. 

42 
Do you want ... I will multe 
a traffic violation? 

43 
What we wanted was to see annoying. 

44 
Y. .. judging by your appearance, 
I think it worked. 

45 
Do not press me, ma'am. 

46 
Pressure is what makes it fun. 
You should try it sometime. 

47 
Damn! 

48 
She cree the owner of the world. 

49 
It is. 

50 
Look, just because they are young, 
rich and sexy ... 

51 
What else can it be? 

52 
I need a crane. 
Ah .. and a Expresso. 

53 
3 minutes late, 
5 deliveries in the latter. 

54 
What kind of imbecile calls for free pizza, 
for a delay of 3 minutes? 

55 
The rate of those who want something for free. 
How the whole world on the planet. 

56 
It is too, so I 
has claimed this month. 

57 
Do not cost anything, Sal. 
What I pay my discounts. 

58 
One moment, please. 

59 
If you arrive late again, 
you will not pay. 

60 
You have 15 minutes to deliver these. 

61 
Think you can accomplish? 

62 
I do jumping 
in one foot. 

63 
Come on! 

64 
<i> Calling all units, 
there is a robbery in progress ...</ i> 

65 
<i> suspects are ... 
are armed and dangerous. </ i> 

66 
<i> They were last seen, 
in Lashre and Schurmann. </ i> 

67 
Faster! Come on! 

68 
Date back! Date back! 

69 
Do not move! 

70 
Try not to go too fast. 

71 
Shit! It is the police! 

72 
Do something, man! 

73 
What I'm doing. 

74 
-- Go more slowly. 
-- I do not want to lose him. 

75 
-- It's better than stars. 
-- We will not. 

76 
Come on, man! 

77 
Apartat of my way! 

78 
Take it calmly! 

79 
There are 2 of them! 
They are on our ass! Come on! 

80 
It is too fast. 

81 
Oh, hell! 

82 
Move back! 
I'm going to be late! 

83 
More slowly! 
Be careful with this car! 

84 
-- Trying to kill? 
-- Try to grab such. 

85 
It's the same thing. 

86 
Tómalo calmly! 

87 
That's it! For! 

88 
Yes, Mr! 

89 
What carajo! 

90 
One minute and 10 seconds late! 
Thank you for free pizzas. 

91 
Is not what you do, or do you? 

92 
Was your crane which I delayed? 

93 
You have a crane outside, you could 
have sought pizzas yourself. 

94 
But then had not been free. 

95 
Lindo car. 

96 
It was my husband, was drunk. 

97 
I could not where it was going to take. 

98 
She must be conducted savagely. 

99 
Who says that this is not the case? 

100 
It is a tragedy. 

101 
It is a high performance vehicle. 
Must be driven hard and fast. 

102 
All the time. 

103 
That means that if 
stands much time on it ... 

104 
... decks lose air, 
transmission is oxidized ... 

105 
and fuel expires. 
I know what he means. 

106 
These cars require 
Pistons well lubricated. 

107 
How do you know? 

108 
I've seen a couple of engines. 

109 
My kids are hungry, 
and the pizza is cooling. 

110 
Should not bring food? 

111 
Stay with the change. 

112 
Thanks for the Council, 
Pizza man. 

113 
It's all good. You have my number. 

114 
In general, is 
how something simple ... 

115 
Gasoline old rubbish ... 
stuck in the filter ... 

116 
... or a weak battery. 
But, whatever, Mrs. Devereaux. 

117 
It will be ready to take 
tomorrow afternoon. 

118 
You're the mechanic? 

119 
Do not carry this clothing 
to be in fashion. 

120 
Of course not. 
But why did not he carries? 

121 
By the way, perhaps you should be set at, 
Samples that if you're a woman. 

122 
I do not need anyone be fixed at me. 

123 
We call for the cost, 
before doing the job. 

124 
Do not worry. Only arreglalo. 

125 
Perra! 

126 
Do we really believe we 
an opportunity with this woman? 

127 
Why not? 
Why is married, and is rich. 

128 
The women how she, 
how leeches are social ... 

129 
... and only fixing in men, 
they can deal with them. 

130 
And you're just a 
pizza deliveryman. 

131 
Then I change my life. 
Let me run for you. 

132 
You can not lead or 
a pizza on time. 

133 
I am the best! 

134 
Give me the keys to the Ford, 
and 5 minutes of your time ... 

135 
... and you take a walk, 
you despeinará hair. 

136 
I can not. 

137 
Customers expect their cars, 
I can not take your time. 

138 
Perhaps a bit. 

139 
Yes, today I met with Warner. 
To that I referred. 

140 
Not everything that says a woman, 
is a reflection of his men. 

141 
If it is! 

142 
Grow! 

143 
Well. When Ford is ready ... 

144 
... adjust according to what my 
standards, and we are on careers. 

145 
And who will be the driver? 

146 
When the Ford is ready, 
need a driver ... 

147 
... and I'm that type. 

148 
You what I will try. 

149 
Are you sure you with something 
not start with a kick? 

150 
The motorcycle! Oh, hell! 

151 
I need this car in 
running the streets ... 

152 
... not earn any money, 
while here in the workshop. 

153 
Forge can fix it. 
Can I run for you? 

154 
First the pizza deliveryman. 
Are you now? 

155 
You do not have license, you're lucky 
you leave the car park. 

156 
Your mother will return soon, 
and I will kill you if I stop doing that. 

157 
Mom will return to Germany after 
that was the fourth husband divorced. 

158 
The fifth is already on its way, I know. 

159 
The cars are how women, boy. 

160 
Give them a lot of drinking, 
not make them go faster. 

161 
Only got drunk, 
and you vomit over ... 

162 
... before falling asleep, 
after that. 

163 
Then ... How do you know 
if the service did you do? 

164 
You're wrong. 

165 
Who says? 

166 
I said that. 
Measure times ... 

167 
... pressure fuel, 
maneuverability, oil pressure ... 

168 
... everything is here, and it is perfect. 

169 
Listen. 

170 
Who's the mechanic here? 
Do you ... or the computer? 

171 
It's me. 

172 
Then how one starts working. 

173 
A true mechanic. 

174 
Watch. 

175 
Sientelo. 

176 
Listen. 

177 
What this car tells you, 
how a fuel sensor ... 

178 
... is that it will be much better, 
if confundirte avoid. 

179 
Takes. 

180 
It deals a little with my program. 

181 
When will you begin 
write reports? 

182 
And where you'll be? 

183 
I will be in the library, 
reading a bit. 

184 
Excuse me, sir. 

185 
But we need to investigate 
theft this afternoon. 

186 
I do not know. Treatment 
investigate this pudding ... 

187 
and do not want to be ... 
interrupted. 

188 
I was in pursuit. 

189 
You are going to be the same novice, 
while I have my plate. 

190 
Yes, sir. 

191 
Can I ask you a question? 

192 
Why does someone steal a cup of coffee? 
They have very little money. 

193 
It's a cover. 

194 
They must have an operation 
money laundering. 

195 
Stan has been dealing 
the business of the game ... 

196 
... in this territory, 
and is good at that. 

197 
But would steal a suicide. 

198 
Not if you think you're more 
big as him. 

199 
I think it was a banda 
Gregor Gargolov. 

200 
The gangster who wears today, 
insurance are forcibly ... 

201 
... responsible for conquer 
Stan territory. 

202 
Do you think that we can arrest them? 

203 
All were working 
in the case of coffee ... 

204 
... before we reached us. 

205 
Then ... 

206 
We have no victims or witnesses ... 

207 
It's just a robbery, and there is no 
no evidence useful. 

208 
What is the cause for concern? 

209 
Because officers were 2 
Wounded persecution. 

210 
Sorry for them ... 

211 
... but my experience tells me 
that this case will be closed soon. 

212 
What if this close? 

213 
Probably those involved 
will be pressing. 

214 
Can you say something about who 
is responsible in this case? 

215 
I would like to help. 

216 
I think we need strength 
extra day and night. 

217 
If force is the land that 
needed, I am your man. 

218 
Do you know anything you can do 
to put pressure on these guys? 

219 
Yes, Mr! 

220 
Let me finish my damned 
lunch in peace. 

221 
The blue devil is going to the front, 
entering the sector. 

222 
How much money pusiste 
in this race? 

223 
Everything that was me. 
500 to go ... 

224 
... and another thousand in this. 

225 
Is that all? 

226 
It is hard to maintain 
cars in good condition. 

227 
Everything we do is make them 
points and oil changes. 

228 
Then ... Why you did? 

229 
Someone has to keep their engines, 
and change their tyres. 

230 
Doubles only that corner. 
Did you achieve? 

231 
There are!. In addition, customers are. 

232 
If you do not get 50 large in 6 days 
the bank will stay with the workshop. 

233 
Will 6 days? 

234 
How you do that? 

235 
While in all races, 
and betting our drivers. 

236 
Only I say this because 
we are family ... 

237 
... and so you apures 
in repairing the Ford. 

238 
But if you say a word of 
this in the workshop ... 

239 
... you beaten to death 
with your laptop. 

240 
I thought that the workshop 
We were family. 

241 
That is different. 

242 
If it were not, would not have 
anyone that it would be. 

243 
How win today? 

244 
4, maybe 5 thousand .... 

245 
... depends on how much there is at stake. 

246 
And if we lose? 

247 
It's all in Ford 
and the Cyber morning. 

248 
This kind if he knows lead. 

249 
Anyone can drive. 

250 
Encuentrénme someone 
that can compete. 

251 
Salame and cheese. 
It's how you like, Dork. 

252 
<i> And the winner is ... the devil blue! </ i> 

253 
You have ghost driver 
to lose one of these days. 

254 
-- Want to bet? 
-- Always. 

255 
Hey, Wolf ... 

256 
Will came to running, 
or take a nap? 

257 
Well. Who wants to beat Wolf? 

258 
Come on, there must be 
someone with balls! 

259 
I do not know your pizza. 

260 
Perhaps you should ... 

261 
... and the cowards have to eat, 
while watching the men running. 

262 
$ 500 bet. 
If you have the cash. 

263 
No, but forget the money 
and runs with me. 

264 
Why would it? 

265 
Because if not, look like you're using 
the money as an excuse. 

266 
All will know that you have 
fear of losing me. 

267 
If you're smart, you will. 

268 
Need an incentive. 

269 
The car is not mine. 

270 
Oh ... Do not tell me boy dealer? 

271 
If I win, I want your hand ... 

272 
Now let's see who is the coward. 

273 
Do not talk seriously? 

274 
I took this bet. 

275 
Anyone who can not 
Ukrainian defeat a dog ... 

276 
... on American soil, deserves 
losing his dirty hand. 

277 
Yes, that's okay. 

278 
I am inside. 

279 
If I win, I want the money, 
and your Ipod. 

280 
Cálmense! 

281 
<i> guy from the pizza win! </ i> 

282 
Where to learn 
driving well, man? 

283 
It's nothing, man. 

284 
It was a Test Drive 
very silly to me. 

285 
I thought we should try. 

286 
I think I should an Ipod. 

287 
I hope you have something 
of Neil Diamond. 

288 
I wish that we had not 
to hide. 

289 
Whether you go very wrong, how to 
leave with a man like me. 

290 
The street racing is illegal. 

291 
I lose my plate, if my 
chief learns what I did. 

292 
It could lose their lives, whether 
brokers believe that treason. 

293 
Did not. 

294 
Not yet. 

295 
Some types, robbed the bank 
an operation to launder money. 

296 
I think we were street racers. 

297 
How do you know? 

298 
The way to lead is unique, 
is how the way you ... 

299 
Do Cojo? 

300 
I was going to say, work.

301 
I saw Wolf, make some 
how shaky yesterday. 

302 
You are trying to save the workshop, 
and beat all runners. 

303 
If I arrest Wolf, 
VIR might against their heads ... 

304 
... might help me in my career. 

305 
What would you stop? 

306 
I can not arrest Wolf, 
without an order from my superiors. 

307 
And they refuse to dármela. 

308 
It is all lies. 

309 
How can understand that? 

310 
It is because you are too hard. 

311 
It was a few minutes ago. 

312 
Want you double? 

313 
Until the money knows 
that can be used well. 

314 
Okay. It was a way of 
get information. 

315 
Are you concerned that the police find out 
you're a runner street? 

316 
Why did you do? 

317 
I never imagined that I stars 
against a wall. It was terrible. 

318 
Never knew what happened afterwards. 

319 
I had no control at the races. 

320 
Nobody has it. 

321 
I do not want anything to happen to me 
So how in my life again. 

322 
I am good driving a car. 
Do not you think? 

323 
I feel that I have control of everything. 

324 
Experiment total calm. 
Real Peace. 

325 
It is how to be here with you. 

326 
Why do you think I control? 

327 
No. Because I love you. 

328 
I do not think that is racing 
for much longer. 

329 
Do not like how I drive? 

330 
No. I love a lot. 

331 
But if you do not get 50 large 
6 days ... 

332 
the bank ... I will remove the workshop. 

333 
What's with this workshop? 
Whether you find another. 

334 
How can you say that? 

335 
Not only is the workshop, Eric. 

336 
My mother died when 
I was 3 years ... 

337 
... my father when I was 16, 
my brother when he was 19. 

338 
This workshop is the only thing 
share. 

339 
If you lose ... 

340 
... I lose them. 

341 
Then ... 

342 
You win. 

343 
How can you be sure? 

344 
Win the next race. 

345 
And another after that. 

346 
And after another. 

347 
Until you have your money. 

348 
You can not know that. 

349 
I promise. 

350 
Let me teach you how to drive. 

351 
Do You Hear that? 

352 
What? It's just someone driving. 

353 
It is the BMW of the blonde, 
Got it the radiator. 

354 
So what? 

355 
That car has given me problems, 
since it came into my workshop yesterday. 

356 
Suéltame! 

357 
-- Did you're going to strike back? 
-- No, I'm going to kill. 

358 
Calm down! 

359 
It was that the car looks bad, 
but ... I won the race! 

360 
I took a little for rental, 
gambling debts ... 

361 
... but the rest is yours. 

362 
This is only the beginning of the 
I can win for us. 

363 
There are 4 great! 

364 
That does not cover damage to my 
you did in that car! 

365 
This idiot, I am going to cost money 
that I won the race yesterday .... 

366 
... and much more. 

367 
-- Really? 
-- Oh, if! 

368 
-- No! 
-- Why not? 

369 
-- Because you going to hit! 
-- You can try! 

370 
Do you know? Strips blows 
how Doblas curves ... 

371 
... you put too much style. 
-- Who says? 

372 
My instinct. That's why we kicked the 
Rear here, or on the road. 

373 
-- You decide. 
-- How about now? 

374 
The customer comes in the car tomorrow. 
What would you say? 

375 
It is only a small! 

376 
This is a workshop, you can 
fix it. It's what you do. 

377 
It was what he was doing. 

378 
Katie! 
Come on! 

379 
What's your problem? 

380 
There is enough for both. 

381 
I do not think so. 

382 
Are you afraid that I see driving? 

383 
You will become a memory. 

384 
I am afraid that you do not see what more 
important in their lives. 

385 
Do you? You can get something better. 

386 
This workshop ... 

387 
If you do not pay in 6 days, disappears. 

388 
Just more open hole. 

389 
If she loses her business, 
you finish. 

390 
Oh, boy! 

391 
It should be a great 
Working plate ... 

392 
... replace the mouth 
fuel. 

393 
Fix the radiator, 
and welding the clutch. 

394 
I hope I have wrong. 

395 
Is there anything you do not need 
be fixed? 

396 
The upholstery might be intact. 

397 
Well! 

398 
Perhaps were very 
occupied admiration ... 

399 
... how to assess 
rest of the damage. 

400 
I do not think so. 

401 
What happened to my husband indictment? 

402 
Yo. 

403 
There was a race yesterday. 

404 
And I wanted to go, so ... 

405 
Borrow your car. 

406 
And you you left off? 

407 
No. Cúlpame to me, I took it. 

408 
-- Why? 
-- I needed the money. 

409 
Y. .. 

410 
... the truth, I wanted to show 
Katie to what could be done. 

411 
So, you can destroy cars? 

412 
I am very good conductor. 

413 
Just give me the opportunity, 
or I myself. 

414 
Watch. If you want to call 
the police? Okay ... 

415 
... I will stay to be arrested. 
Otherwise ... 

416 
Pagare damage, giving you everything 
what they earn in the races. 

417 
Are you so good? 

418 
I won yesterday. 

419 
So looks when you win? 

420 
Look at me. 

421 
So ... how it looks ... 
when you win. 

422 
A car can be arranged, 
only need money! 

423 
You can not buy what I am! 

424 
Do these races ... are illegal? 

425 
Anything as good, 
usually it is. 

426 
Let me mostrártelo. 

427 
Well, pizza man, muéstramelo. 

428 
Then I will tell you that you. 

429 
My husband does not return until 
next week. 

430 
Until then, make them 
This car runs with yours. 

431 
Or not. 

432 
Do you see? 
Everything will come out well. 

433 
-- If you're lucky that this type! 
-- Go. 

434 
Look! 

435 
How do? 

436 
When he left your car 
training? 

437 
Yesterday. 

438 
Just before earn. 

439 
Perhaps you shoot, 
if you have a car like that. 

440 
Maybe I should shoot 
face against yours. 

441 
Thank God llegaste 
with those pizzas. 

442 
Start. 

443 
Please. 

444 
You're fast! 

445 
What if they'd done 
had been slow? 

446 
I would have smoked a Cuban cigar ... 

447 
... and enjoyed a drink 
of good white wine. 

448 
Waiting for gourmet food. 

449 
I do not want to be interfered, but ... 

450 
... but you should not do 
This whole week. 

451 
My wife had an unexpected, 
and left me with the kids ... 

452 
... and they wanted to invite 
his friends. 

453 
Now they are hungry, 
and the only thing I have is caviar. 

454 
I hear that many 
Sometimes in my work. 

455 
It was pizza. 

456 
Yes, pizza! 

457 
My name is Gregor Gargolov. 

458 
And you impressed me. 

459 
If delayed more than 3 minutes, 
the order is free. 

460 
It is a model. 

461 
I am talking about yesterday. 

462 
I am something like a 
fanatic careers. 

463 
I like how they drive. 

464 
-- Do you know that you won your man? 
-- It is not over. 

465 
You're it. 

466 
Does it know? 

467 
If you're smart, you know 
when your time went. 

468 
Perhaps only I was lucky. 

469 
I do not think so. 

470 
If driving to my .... 

471 
... you give the car, 
you cover the races ... 

472 
... and I'll give you 10% 
of ganancías. 

473 
I ... I appreciate your offer, 
Mr Gargolov, but ... 

474 
... I just want the $ 30 
pizzas, and a generous tip. 

475 
Tired of annoying if you wonder why? 

476 
Any other driver, 
seize this opportunity. 

477 
I imagine that I am not a 
of those drivers. 

478 
There is more that I know ... 

479 
Is this familiar? 

480 
Do Brat Pitt? 
Maybe Justin Timberlake? 

481 
Close. 

482 
This is a police sketch, 
of a thief who stole ... 

483 
... a shop in Tennessee, 
last year. 

484 
The thieves made sounded the 
alarm, and captured. 

485 
But the driver, escaped to 
a dozen police cars ... 

486 
... and a helicopter. 

487 
A great feat! 

488 
What happened with him? 

489 
Nobody knows. 

490 
But I have the hunch, 
you that you were a thief. 

491 
Dad! 

492 
Ernie put in Pizza 
DVD player. 

493 
Okay. 

494 
I already there. 

495 
So is being a parent, Mike. 

496 
One crisis after another. 

497 
Already we are on the fourth 
DVD player. 

498 
Can you find out? 

499 
If. I have good sense 
of the management. 

500 
Well. I know that back 
to see us soon. 

501 
More will be worth it 
more fun than Bingo ... 

502 
... or take a couple of beers, 
or you're going to jail. 

503 
-- How often does this happen? 
-- Every day, somewhere. 

504 
And the police did not learn? 

505 
No. It kept moving, 
caring for their backs. 

506 
One raid, it may happen to a 
mile, and nobody knows. 

507 
What bet? 

508 
The keys to the car, 
cover the bet ... 

509 
... and 20 thousand to the line. 

510 
Do you know something of my opponents? 

511 
That, the driver of the white Supra ... 

512 
... is good in narrow areas, 
so be careful in grubbed. 

513 
That's not my concern, will be tense. 

514 
Do you see that woman in R.S.I? 

515 
It is a professional 
the tight curves. 

516 
So will end in complete shock. 

517 
Sueno confident. 

518 
I meet my promises. 

519 
Do not spill. 

520 
Tourists! 

521 
What is the prize? 

522 
The bet your opponent, 
anything of value. 

523 
Most do it for nothing. 
Only play in the car. 

524 
So, how to cover 
the bet? 

525 
Many can not, we must 
find alguin as Katie .... 

526 
... drive their cars, and take a 
percent of what they bet. 

527 
It was my car which lead yesterday. 
How then run? 

528 
I want to lead well! 

529 
It's best to look, 
is quite dangerous. 

530 
But do not feel so 
how well do it! 

531 
It is not as easy as it sounds. 

532 
Then, TeachMe! 

533 
TeachMe your movements, 
Pizza man! 

534 
Would you like to leave you? 

535 
We seek another. 

536 
Oh, my god! 

537 
<i> This workshop is the only thing that remains 
of what we share ...</ i> 

538 
<i> If you lose ... the lose to them. </ i> 

539 
Thank you. 

540 
Maybe next time. 

541 
I hope that is in good condition. 

542 
I do not want to spend money on it, 
before selling it. 

543 
Perhaps you want to buy it. 

544 
She wanted to make the bet. 
We are not against it. 

545 
All they earn, 
ever lose. 

546 
You need a car. 

547 
Consigámos one. 

548 
Not for this. 

549 
It is a waste of time 
repairing this car. 

550 
The lady said that the arreglaramos. 

551 
If you start a job, terminal. 

552 
It is going to lose workshop 
anyway. 

553 
Well, you do not need to lose 
its integrity with him. 

554 
How are they? 

555 
I do not want angustiarte ... 

556 
... but we have no credit, 
Answers to buy. 

557 
Cash payments. 

558 
And where will? 

559 
Venda the Ford. 

560 
You can not. 

561 
I thought we had a week 
Ms. Devereaux. 

562 
My name is Nicole, and save yourself 
the problems by now. 

563 
I'm going to give a new priority. 

564 
I want to see me make a 
auto racing. 

565 
I have just one 
I can sell. 

566 
Wait ... Do not you 
Ford talking about, no? 

567 
It is a very good car! 

568 
If that is so, why 
you can not sell it. 

569 
You have work to do, 
ve to do it! 

570 
You can quedártelo, I am not 
interested in the car of anyone. 

571 
I want to buy a new one. 
And you want me manufactures a car. 

572 
I'm not toys, for 
shelves of trophies wives. 

573 
I autos, for 
Serious runners. 

574 
Wait. 

575 
Harás sausages to live, 
if you do not get money. 

576 
Right now! 

577 
Make me the best car 
modified for racing ... 

578 
... and forget about whatever the cost. 

579 
I do not care how much cost. 
While the car melted asphalt. 

580 
-- I think. 
-- Do this, because this is what I love. 

581 
And you do not have another option. 

582 
This will serve to begin, 
Call me when you finish. 

583 
Were not you supposed to say, 
"Thank you, Mike, to save my rear? 

584 
Go here! Not back. 

585 
That was not the appreciation 
I expected. 

586 
I can win races for you. 
I need more than ever. 

587 
I do not want to see you in 
this workshop again! 

588 
Even bringing pizza. 

589 
Okay. 

590 
You were very harsh with him ... 

591 
... everything you want 
do is run. 

592 
I heard that is good. 

593 
It is devastating, irresponsible, 
and dangerous. 

594 
How all riders 
you know. 

595 
Only those who have died. 

596 
I finished with them. 

597 
We have a car to repair, 
and another to build ... 

598 
... in only 3 days 
to save the workshop. 

599 
So let us do it! 

600 
And the Ford? 

601 
We stay so, for now. 

602 
Corrado for you. 

603 
I'm so happy! 

604 
We will make a lot of money together, 
and we also have fun. 

605 
Wait, I am your driver. 

606 
And will remain so. 

607 
Bring the boys to school, 
and my wife shopping. 

608 
Dale Supra keys to Mike. 

609 
No. Quédatelas. 

610 
Do not take the car to anyone. 

611 
If I'm going to drive for you 
Mr Gargolov ... 

612 
... I need a car built 
according to my specifications. 

613 
Well. 

614 
Let's go to my workshop, 
and talk with my mechanics. 

615 
Ever lead 
a aventi, Mike? 

616 
Drove a Seat, and was afraid 
to fall asleep at the wheel. 

617 
You are driving. 

618 
Listens how the engine 
if a symphony. 

619 
Each car sounds different. 

620 
It's how ... 

621 
Leopard Pearl, the BMW, 
the volcanic roar ... 

622 
... the great Chevy Black ... 
differs from R.S.I. 

623 
But the car that build parts 
customized, is more than unique. 

624 
I remember this. 

625 
You do not understand. 

626 
What's with writing? 

627 
What? 

628 
Who says that it is not stolen, 
and someone will come for him? 

629 
Not only am rich and beautiful, 
I have an education. 

630 
A film is sufficient 
to learn that. 

631 
What sounds so hard that? 

632 
How the roar of a thunder. 

633 
Let me show you to 
Where was your money. 

634 
We eliminate the installation 
air conditioning ... 

635 
... engines windows. Basically, 
everything that makes a car comfortable. 

636 
That makes it slower. 

637 
We take about 1000 pounds 
this baby. 

638 
To curb, has 6 packages, 
in the front and rear wheels. 

639 
These are custom rims. 
But not for skidding, of course. 

640 
Of course. 

641 
We increased the monitoring system, 
The cooling system ... 

642 
... and we did more beautiful. 
-- Great! 

643 
We put new watches, 
and pedals. 

644 
That red button panel, 
punish anything on the route. 

645 
Sliding Doors. 
They are useless, but pretty. 

646 
I thought you liked. 
If, like me. 

647 
I want the car to stay here. 

648 
We pay rent. 

649 
It's your money. 

650 
Speaking of desires, your account. 

651 
Everything is installed here. 

652 
Not spending enough 
to cover the debt. 

653 
-- It is a fair price. 
-- We want to save the workshop. 

654 
I can write a check now, 
that will solve all your problems. 

655 
Only change a debt for another. 

656 
I do not want to be indebted to you. 

657 
That would be enough, 
Life would be easier. 

658 
-- There are 5 minutes! 
-- What are you doing here? 

659 
-- Costume who ordered pizza. 
-- Do not asked any pizza! 

660 
I did. I'm hungry. 
And I'm ready for my lesson. 

661 
What drive? 

662 
My new car racing! 

663 
Not bad. 

664 
I work with this. 

665 
First rule of racing. 

666 
Never look back, 
because behind you, never mind. 

667 
Where do we go? 

668 
Where we can accelerate. 

669 
Well. 

670 
Arranquémos this baby. 

671 
Enjoy your lunch. 

672 
It's all in the control 
of speed. 

673 
Brakes and driving. 

674 
What happens if I press this? 

675 
Register. 

676 
The speed will put you ahead. 
But not win the race. 

677 
Driving and psychology. 

678 
Care for the drawings, Get inside, 
and pressed to move your opponent. 

679 
O. .. bloquéalo, before you go. 

680 
Now it's your turn. 

681 
He made some 
investigations, sir. 

682 
-- I did not know that. 
-- Now we know. 

683 
This ... is the place where Stan 
moving your money laundering. 

684 
How do you know that? 

685 
Every day arrive 
with heavy bags ... 

686 
... when to go, 20 minutes later, 
pockets are empty. 

687 
That does not mean that the 
bags have money. 

688 
Perhaps they are selling merchandise. 

689 
Then ... Why is this 
rate monitor? 

690 
It is the driver we are pursuing. 

691 
What makes watching this place? 

692 
Five trucks, which by chance 
I saw parked outside the coffee ... 

693 
... the day of the robbery. 

694 
Do we really write down the plates ... 

695 
... of the cars we saw in 
the crime scene? 

696 
I am a detective. That we do. 

697 
I saw the same vehicle? 
where are the offices. 

698 
I think it prepares Gargolov 
to take another blow. 

699 
If so, we may be 
wait. 

700 
Arrest everyone, 
remove this tumor once. 

701 
That was thinking, sir. 

702 
Let me see this. 

703 
If you've got something, get a 
permission to organize everything. 

704 
Much earlier. 

705 
I would like to be part of 
this team, sir. 

706 
See what I can do. 

707 
That's not all ... 

708 
You visit. 

709 
Excuse me, sir. 

710 
What are you doing here? 

711 
Does not appear, 
not answer your phone ... 

712 
... so here I am. 

713 
What do you want? 

714 
Dart this. 

715 
Do not blame for losing 
career, Eric. 

716 
Then there must be another reason, 
so you can take to another. 

717 
Give him the keys. 

718 
Warner is not a broker, 
is a banker. 

719 
I do not give you an extension 
Payment by a fuck. 

720 
It seems that we will not give. 

721 
-- Are you following Mike? 
-- It's my job. 

722 
I think it's a fugitive. 
If so, what arrests. 

723 
You can not! 

724 
Why would not it? 

725 
-- What love? 
-- Whether that what I lost. 

726 
-- He spoke of careers. 
-- I know that I speak. 

727 
I never said I loved you, Eric. 

728 
Never said no. 

729 
I can not get involved 
emotionally with brokers. 

730 
-- But if another. 
-- Another who die on the expiry. 

731 
Another, which is worse than me. 

732 
I do not want to get you started, Eric. 

733 
I want it back. 

734 
How can bet your car? 
Is Selling your life? 

735 
It's the way it always has been. 

736 
I do not believe that. 

737 
Cree that what you want, 
but you need to run ... 

738 
... and do not have a car. 

739 
I have one for you. 

740 
Evidence ... test again. 
Try again. 

741 
Accelerate. 

742 
Sharp inside. 

743 
Turn right. 

744 
That's right! That's right! 

745 
Release the accelerator, lessens, 
aprienta and clutch. 

746 
Make the turn. 

747 
What did I do? 

748 
Your first skidding. 

749 
How do you feel? 

750 
You tell me. 

751 
Tighten the accelerator. Drop them. 
Use the clutch. 

752 
-- I love my husband. 
-- I do not care. 

753 
Well! 

754 
Eric ... We are ready. 

755 
We started surveillance 24 hours. 
Are you in? 

756 
Absolutely, sir. 

757 
Ready. 

758 
All statistics 
are perfect. 

759 
It's great. 

760 
Think about how to fix the BMW 
by Mrs Deveraux. 

761 
Does Brom? 

762 
Do not spend with that, 
see this car in action. 

763 
There we go, we have no driver.

764 
What's Eric? 

765 
If it were to come, would already be here. 

766 
We can not miss, 
We have only one day. 

767 
That's why I will 
selling the car tomorrow. 

768 
Can I at least give a 
back to the block? 

769 
Da 2 laps, not only as Ray. 

770 
Which of these is yours? 
The above. 

771 
I imagined that was that. 

772 
I would like to see it. 

773 
Can have, 
but you can not have that. 

774 
I do not want to move you, 
just see how you live. 

775 
We know! But that part 
My life belongs to Gustav. 

776 
You have fear that I see. 

777 
-- We are in the car. 
-- He knows my needs. 

778 
So why not worry? 

779 
Doing so. On his way. 

780 
I do leave my life, 
and makes no questions. 

781 
No? 

782 
None of the expected 2 
the other is faithful. 

783 
As we continue loving. 

784 
We are united, but we are free. 

785 
What about the money 
Spending in this car? 

786 
He is not interested, I can spend 
what they give me in anything. 

787 
No question about my bills! 

788 
What? You can give me 100 thousand U.S. dollars, 
and say that the loss. 

789 
It was supposed to spend the money, 
on things that make me happy to me. 

790 
Do not you would give me 100 big happy? 

791 
In reality you want to buy? 

792 
Would you feel happy 
being my property? 

793 
-- It would not be so! 
-- How do you know? 

794 
Because ... Gustav you bought, 
and yet you're happy! 

795 
Sorry. It was stupid 
what I said. 

796 
Mike, if you have a problem 
with this, dilo now. 

797 
I do not. 
Honestly. 

798 
Well. I need you to understand 
something about myself. 

799 
My life is ... 
very safe. 

800 
Very safe. 

801 
All dangers disappeared, 
and I need that danger back ... 

802 
... to feel my heart beating, 
how if it were to explode. 

803 
To be part of something, 
apart from this marriage. 

804 
And I think what I found. 

805 
But they never leave, 
by anyone, not for nothing. 

806 
I do not want to ask that. 

807 
An intelligent man. 

808 
Rainer took the Ford, 
and not yet returned. 

809 
Is not that what you said 
Venda, is not it? 

810 
If. 

811 
Damn! 

812 
So is running with it! 

813 
Hey, I can arrive quickly, but 
I only have room for one. 

814 
I those achieved! 

815 
Oh, God! 

816 
Rainer ... 
Oh my God! 

817 
Levántenlo! 

818 
Assortment to bring my car! 

819 
Everything will be fine. 

820 
Be careful with him. 

821 
Everything will be fine. 
I will go right behind you. 

822 
Go. 

823

Verifying.

827 
Do you know how lucky you have to stop 
come with me to a novice how you? 

828 
-- I am very grateful. 
-- Learn a lot too. 

829 
Starting with the introduction, at 2 
most important objects of surveillance. 

830 
What is that? 

831 
A urine bag. 
What goes in, must leave. 

832 
It would be great to have a 
movies as well. 

833 
Hello. 

834 
What hospital? 

835 
Now I go out there. 

836 
I have to leave. 

837 
In the midst of a vigilance? 

838 
It's a family emergency. 
'll Be back at how you can. 

839 
I'm here. 
How are you? 

840 
The magic, and that is what 
mattered. 

841 
Watch ... 

842 
The doctor said I had to 
tell the police. 

843 
Which means, that will ask questions, 
we do not want to answer. 

844 
I say that I am a doctor police. 
What do you think that? 

845 
Thank you. 

846 
What else can I do? 

847 
It's my fault, if it had appeared .... 

848 
You and Katie were made 
for each other. 

849 
I do not want you to take the 
responsibility for everything. 

850 
Believe it or not, people do 
stupid things for themselves. 

851 
I recall that. 

852 
I hope so. 

853 
Why you're tempted, 
to do something stupid now. 

854 
-- What makes him here? 
-- Mike who was brought to Rainer. 

855 
Would you're couching it as well? 

856 
What do you think they do? 
Will begin a fight here? 

857 
It's just what I need now! 
Grow! 

858 
Where are the parents of the boy? 

859 
His mother is in Canada. Soy 
her cousin, and I am responsible for it. 

860 
You can see it, but only for a minute. 

861 
We are about to take him to surgery. 

862 
What were you thinking? 

863 
Never drove a car so powerful. 

864 
I thought it would be easy ... 

865 
I was so wrong! 

866 
We do not have to do it. 

867 
Someone has to do, 
or it will lose everything. 

868 
It's just a workshop. 

869 
It is so difficult! 

870 
We are ready to carry them. 

871 
Please stay with me. 

872 
I can not. 

873 
Only for a while. 

874 
I have to go. 

875 
I do not go anywhere. 

876 
What will. 

877 
You have wasted half 
your life with me. 

878 
I want to see what he has. 

879 
Leave go, please. 

880 
He took a Hand 
a boy tonight. 

881 
So tonight boy 
became a man. 

882 
A crippled man! 

883 
All men have scars. 

884 
And your friend learned by himself ... 

885 
... who never let an opponent, 
able to buscarte. 

886 
In Kiev, there are many men with 
a hand through me. 

887 
It is good advice, Mr Gargolov. 

888 
Why not give me the axe?, And you 
I teach the same lesson this imbecile. 

889 
It would, but ... 
is the nephew of my wife. 

890 
What luck that you are! 

891 
The fate of is him. 

892 
I like you. Mike. 

893 
Well, I'm not really 
a fan to you now! 

894 
Perhaps this will change your way of thinking. 

895 
Your car is finished, 
and ready to run. 

896 
I do not think so. 

897 
Do not like the car? 

898 
I do not like people who 
works for you. 

899 
Because you remember who you are. 

900 
Has someone how I looked, 
since your mother died. 

901 
Since you left. 

902 
It is the only way to live, 
when you get what you want. 

903 
Yes, but I need to change. 

904 
You have expensive tastes ... 
in cars, women. 

905 
How long do you think that your girlfriend 
rich soon get bored of you? 

906 
There are still a lot of women, 
who like things cheap and dirty. 

907 
Thank God for that! 

908 
Then ... 

909 
Just back to distribute ... 
pizza? 

910 
In this cute scooter you have? 

911 
That's the plan. 

912 
Who want to deceive, Mike? 
You will not rich in that way. 

913 
Do not go to prison either. 

914 
This is a breakthrough. 

915 
Buy some clothes, and 
get a phone number. 

916 
Corrado for me. 

917 
And as payment for the privilege, 
you get some work exhaust. 

918 
If you get my pocket money ... 

919 
I feel deeply ... 
insulted. 

920 
It's the last thing I would do. 

921 
So it should be. 

922 
Tomorrow, you will lead to Markus 
pick up some documents for me. 

923 
Need to bring it back fast. 

924 
I am confident that you will either. 

925 
Need to make Mead morning? 

926 
No. Thank you. 

927 
Well, this thing is nearly full. 

928 
I'm going to empty it. 

929 
Stay vigilant while going. 

930 
I'll do. 

931 
Prepare all, we visit. 

932 
Keep the engine running. 

933 
This does not take much time. 

934 
All units, 
maintain their position. 

935 
Nobody moves until 
return to take the car. 

936 
Shit! 

937 
Shit! Shit! 

938 
Shit! The whore shit! 

939 
Nobody moves, until they leave. 

940 
Arms lists. 

941 
We are exposed! 

942 
All units come into action! 

943 
See you, friend! 

944 
Rainer surgery went very well, 
is now recovering. 

945 
Does that mean that you can 
use your hand? 

946 
It will take months ... 

947 
... before we know how much 
sensitivity and mobility won, but ... 

948 
... do not have that, 
anything can happen. 

949 
I appreciate what he did, doctor. 
Thank you. 

950 
Go home and rest a bit. 

951 
Let the Ford, 
and llevemóslo the workshop. How well? 

952 
I stay here, and I hope 
Eric to return. 

953 
And then return to the workshop. 

954 
We need to pack, 
before the bank comes tomorrow. 

955 
See you later. 

956 
You are arrested. 

957 
I do not think so. 

958 
I saw you took part 
in the theft today. 

959 
And I am sure, that is not the only 
crime he has committed. 

960 
Probably not. 

961 
But how explanations 
I recognize? 

962 
I was reading your 
American record. 

963 
And why Mir that? 

964 
I will say that you saw between the 
Gargolov people. 

965 
And what of you were to Gargolov, 
because follow Wolf. 

966 
Who know, for careers 
those involved in illegal. 

967 
Try it. 

968 
I do not have to do, 
I am not a policeman. 

969 
The only thing I do 
is tell your boss. 

970 
And the damage will be done. 

971 
Are you threatening me? 

972 
You are who aims a weapon 
a man disarmed! 

973 
Takes you inside. 

974 
That can wait for 
after the race. 

975 
What career? 

976 
The you are going to win today, 
and Katie does not lose the workshop. 

977 
Why did you do? 

978 
Because you've seen run. 

979 
I can not win this race. 

980 
You can. 

981 
I still will be here tomorrow ... 

982 
Katie ... but will no longer be the workshop. 

983 
This does not change anything between us. 

984 
In this case you're right. 

985 
Sweet! 

986 
You do not need something sweeter. 

987 
Made with customized parts .... 

988 
... haganme an offer. 

989 
This is for today. 

990 
Anything! 

991 
I hope you brought the axe. 

992 
If, and cut your balls 
after he wins the race. 

993 
You need new balls, 
because they lost yours. 

994 
Leave it to the race! 

995 
Can we be ready in 5 minutes? 

996 
Let me give a return 
to block first. 

997 
Well. 

998 
Try not to scratch the paintings. 

999 
-- This is how you run? 
-- This is how I win. 

1000 
Yes! 

1001 
-- Do you want me to lead? 
-- I have everything under control! 

1002 
That what I see! 

1003 
So how is leading in Tennessee? 

1004 
It hit me too. 

1005 
Te strange, dear. 

1006 
I, too, dear. 

1007 
Are You were good? 
While Will was away? 

1008 
Hell, no! 

1009 
This is free today. 

1010 
A pizza? 

1011 
Have morrones extra. 

1012 
Those are too many morrones! 

1013 
What do you expect in return? 

1014 
Keep the workshop open, 
sends to the bank to hell ... 

1015 
... and build more cars race. 

1016 
Is that all? 

1017 
Perhaps let me drive one, 
ever. 

1018 
We'll see. 

1019 
We were you, and to my left 
men back, Mike. 

1020 
That was not very fair. 

1021 
My only loyalty is to myself. 

1022 
Some call it cowardice. 

1023 
I call it survival. 

1024 
Like my car wreck. 

1025 
Wolf and I ran. 

1026 
He lost more than his hand. 

1027 
Are not you going to shoot me why? 

1028 
What I am thinking. 

1029 
The misfortunes occur. 

1030 
That's good. Moreover, 
Stake for you in the race. 

1031 
I won enough to buy 
Wolf to a nice coffin ... 

1032 
... and is a lot of money. 

1033 
I am pleased, Mr Gargolov, 
because this concludes our treatment. 

1034 
We no longer work for you. 

1035 
You are an excellent driver. 

1036 
Thank you, I can 
no driver. 

1037 
Do you think you let go? 

1038 
We finished in any forms. 

1039 
What all places 
could have ido, Mike ... 

1040 
... because they came to Germany? 

1041 
I like beer and sausages. 

1042 
See you soon, Mike. 

1043 
<i> Someday, you and I'll go to 
a ride in this car again ....</ i> 

1044 
<i> ... nothing in front of ours, 
other than the route. </ i> 

1045 
<i> I can not wait, daddy. </ i> 

1046 
<i> do not have to do, everything that 
have to do is close our eyes. </ i> 

1047 
Are you going in my direction? 

1048 
Probably. 

1049 
Sube, and we'll see. 

1050 
Thank you for what you did yesterday. 

1051 
Not to talk about. 

1052 
Do not deny, I know what you were 
you who saved my workshop. 

1053 
The way that driving is unique. 

1054 
-- Except as you ... 
-- Cogan. 

1055 
I was going to say "making love". 

1056 
There is a difference. Do you know? 

1057 
Really? 

1058 
How can I bring? 

1059 
-- No! 
-- Sure, rises! 

1060 
If pizza strips in this car, 
kill you. 

1061 
Is there any room for another? 

1062 
Not to pick up your kind, but ... 

1063 
... in this case, I will make an exception. 

1064 
Do not go too fast, 
or you put a fine. 

1065 
Pressure is what 
makes life fun. 

1066 
You should try it sometime. 

1067 
Where do we go? 

1068 
I do not know. But I am glad 
you come. 

1069 
I, too, pizza man. 

1070 
Are you sure where to go? 

1071 
What I am.
