[non-english singing]

VOICE (FROM CAR STEREO):
Where is your brother?

Ou est votre frere?

Ou est votre frere?

Ou est votre frere?

VOICE (FROM CAR STEREO):
Where is your sister?

Ou uest votre soeur?

Ou est votre soeur?

VOICE (FROM CAR STEREO):
Where is your father?

Ou est votre pere?

Hello?

You guys?

Anybody here?

Hello?

[phone ringing]

TOLBERT (ON PHONE): Yo, what up?

You've reached Tolbert!

Hi!

Go on and leave that message.

You know what to do.

Boop!

Hey, Tolbert.

Uh, It's Scott.

Um, why did I come into
work today for nothing?

You told me that we were
working a private party?

TOLBERT: Yeah, we are.

Surprise!

[music playing]

Hey!

Bon voyage, buddy!

Oh, thanks, man.

I don't leave for a week.

Yeah, I know, I know.

But tonight's the only night
the restaurant's closed.

Scotty!

My main man, we are going to
miss you around here, brother.

The place will not be
the same without you.

Wow, thank you.

That's... that's very
nice of you to...

It'll be a lot better!
Oh!

MAN: [laughs]
There it is.

Aw, kidding.

Kind of.

But seriously, bro, I hope
that you make a better

writer than you do a waiter.

All right, Tolbert,
this place better

be clean by opening tomorrow, or
you're doing doubles all week.

Yep, yep.
Gotcha.

All right.

Uh, who are all these people?

Oh, uh, these are
your friends, man.

Happy birthday, Mike!

Scott.

Yeah.

Look, you don't have
a lot of friends,

so I had to improvise
a little bit.

You know?

All right.

I invited some of
my improv class.

She might know you.

But let's just get a drink.

OK.

Oh, yeah.

There we go!

Ah, wait.

To my best friend, who, uh, I
don't really understand why he

has to move to become
a writer, but I guess

it worked for Hemingway.

So bottoms up.

Actually, can we not
talk to Hemingway, though?

Because he ended up
blowing his brains out.

I'mma Google that.

All right.

Look, look, here's to a
better ending than that.

OK.
OK?

Thank you.

Ooh!

Come on, one more.

Ooh, ooh.

Hold up.

Hey, Dad.

Can I call you back?

I'm actually... I'm at
a going away party.

COOKIE (ON PHONE):
Scott, it's Cookie.

I'm using your father's phone.

I'm afraid your
father passed away.

What?

COOKIE (ON PHONE):
He died in his sleep.

I called the crematorium.

They're... they're coming in
two hours if you'd like to see

him before they take him away.

Daddy's dead?

COOKIE (ON PHONE): And
Scott, can... can you

pick up your sister on the way?

[music playing]


Hi.
Is he still here?

Am I too late?

No, he's still in bed,
right where I found him.

OK.

Where's Cindy?

Uh, she stayed in the car.

Drink warm water.

Let cookie massage her legs.

Avoid ice cubes.

Really?

They hurt his teeth.

His teeth?

The man's blood was
50% cholesterol.

He's worried about his teeth?

You know your
father and medicine.

He thought if he saw a
doctor, they'd just find

more things wrong with him.

Yeah, isn't that
kind of the point?

Uh, your father loved
that picture of her.

Well, uh, I hope you
don't mind, but I

collected a few personal items
that I thought you should have.

So this is it, huh?

A man's life reduced to
a 10 by 12 cardboard box.

Oh, no.
That's not it.

Wait a minute.

I also made you a
tuna fish sandwich.

Can you just take this?

Thank you.

Are you OK?

Mom made me a sandwich.

Yeah.

Yeah, me, too.

She's big on the sandwiches.

Although Cookie's not
your mom, you know.

She's... she's Dad's wife.

Or she's Dad's
widow now, I guess.

But you have a mom, right?

So just don't ever
forget that, OK?

You're right.

I'm sorry.

I mean, after everything
that Mom did for you,

can you just please not
call Cookie Mom ever again?

All right!
I said I'm sorry!


[music playing]

We need to make a memorial card.

What?

A memorial card...
you can write it,

and I can draw a picture.

A memorial card?

Who are we going to send...

Yes, OK.

That's a good idea.
Let's make a memorial card.

Yeah, you can write it,
and I can draw a picture.

OK, sure.

CINDY WEAVER: My neighbor
watches TV so loud all night.

I have to wear earplugs.

And when I complain,
she screams at me.

And she drinks a lot.

SCOTT WEAVER: I'm
sorry to hear it.

What do you think I should do?

I don't know, get
bigger earplugs?

No, you're right.

I should just ignore it.

Do you want my sandwich?

I don't like tuna fish.

Me, neither.

I hope Cookie doesn't put
Dad's ashes in one of these.

I really just...

I can't believe that Dad
wanted to be cremated.

Why not?

He never struck me as
a cremation type of guy.

What would you do instead?

I would have a burial like
a normal person in a box

with a funeral in the ground.


I'm sorry if that's
old school for you.

OK, I get it.

That's so boring!

OK, what would you like
to do when you die, then?

I don't know.

I read about this thing where
they can take your ashes

and turn them into a diamond.

A diamond?

A diamond.

So you'd like to be
turned into a diamond?

It beats being stuck in
a box for all eternity.

OK, so... well, then what
happens to the diamond, then?

Who gets that?

I don't know.

If I give it to you,
would you pawn me?

The joke's on you...

I won't even be here.

I'll be in Paris.

Right.

I mean, I'm going
to come and visit you.

Yeah.
Whatever!

[music playing]

[knocking on glass]


[music muffled through the wall]


AUTOMATED VOICE (ON
PHONE): Thank you

for calling the National
Passport Information Center.

All our operators are currently
assisting other customers.

Please stay on the line.

Thank you for calling the
National Passport Information...

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Hello?
Hello?

AUTOMATED VOICE (ON
PHONE): Thank you

for calling the National
Passport Information Center.

All our operators
are currently...

Jesus, Cookie!

Hey.

Hi.

I'm so sorry I'm late.

Okie doke.

So I made you a file.

It's got pink slip,
repair history...

pretty much everything.

Do you have the check?

Oh!

Right.

The car, dude.

Mm-hmm.

I actually called you, but
I think your voicemail's full

or something.
OK.

Well, no need to call.

I'm here now.

So do you have the check?

No, I... I was
trying to tell you

that I'm not buying the car.

Uh, what do you mean?

We had a deal.

Well, yeah.

B- but I asked my parents for
the money to buy your car,

and they said they'd rather just
give me their old car instead.

Are you serious?

It's kind of crazy, you know?

I got to drive around
a stupid minivan.

It actually sucks.

Yeah, that definitely...

that definitely sucks.

Do you want a cone
for the trouble?

Yes, I want a cone.

[music playing]

Cookie, I'm sort
of busy right now.

Is... what?

She did what?

I don't know why you're here.

I told them to tell Cookie.

Yeah, well, Cookie's
pruning fig trees.

She's doing what?

Hello, Cindy.

And you are?

He's my little brother.

What happened?

Well, your sister's having
a problem with a tenant here...

Margaret.
She hit me!

DOCTOR: Hold on a minute, Cindy.

I... she... I told her
to turn down her TV,

and she attacked me!

I told you about her.

Everyone here is crazy!

We're not sure how it started.

She pulled out my hair!

DOCTOR: She claims that
Cindy came in her room...

stole her TV...

and then spit on her when
she tried to stop her.

You spit at her?
She's a liar.

That was my TV.

Trouble's been brewing between
them for quite some time.

You know what?

She's just jealous,
because she wants

to steal my boyfriend,
DeMarco, and he won't

have anything to do with her.

OK, OK.

So, um, you have to
separate them or something?

Normally, yes, but this
isn't the first infraction

Cindy's had here, and we have
a very strict three strikes

policy.

OK, so, um, what
strike is she on?


Really, Cindy?

It's not my fault!

I managed to secure
a room at a board

and care over in
Hammond, but they can't

take your sister for two weeks.

Hammond.

I don't want to go to Hammond.

I grew up in Hammond.

DOCTOR: Well, then you'll
feel right at home.

You can come back later and pick
up the rest of Cindy's things.

I... sorry, what
do you mean later?

I thought that she wasn't
moving for two weeks?

DOCTOR: Not into
the board and care,

but she needs to leave
here immediately.

Oh, it's fine.
I'll just move in with DeMarco.

He's been wanting us to
live together for a while

now, anyway.

We've made a list of
all her medications.

I hope I don't have to remind
you about how important it

is that she stays on them.

[music playing]

Sorry.
I'm sorry.

Me?

Uh, she... she's not... she's
not moving in with me.

No, him... I'm not
moving in with him.

Well, she's not staying here.

She's already been dismissed.

OK, well, undismiss her.

You know, I face a lot of
hard choices at this facility,

Mr. Weaver.

But the only choice I have
right now for your sister

is to give her to you or to
put her out on the street.

Can I see how much I weigh?

Let's go.

That wasn't my fault!

I didn't say that it was.

I'm going to sue them.

Those people are evil!

You can't sue them.
Why not?

Because you can't!

Well, just take me to a hotel.

I'll go to a hotel.

Oh, and who's going
to pay for that?

Your boyfriend?
Yeah!

DeMarco makes a ton of money.

Way more than you do, I bet!

Yeah, well, most people do.

It's a little bit tight,
so just be careful with...


...the door.

This is it.

Um, the bathroom is back
there if you need it.

But please, if you're
going to use a towel,

just pick one and reuse it, OK?

Don't start using all of them.

Also, don't put your
stuff everywhere,

because I'm actually...

I'm trying to pack.

So.

That's... that's my
bedroom, actually,

so if you could just, um...

just don't go in it.

Where's my room?

Um, right here.

I have some sheets
and stuff for you,

I think somewhere
in these boxes.

Uh, no.

SCOTT WEAVER: No?

No.

I need privacy for my yoga.

I have special
breathing exercises,

and I need space to do that.

And I, I, I, I can't
do that in here.

OK.

Can we call Mom?

I want to call Mom.

SCOTT WEAVER: Mom?

Yeah.

Mom can't really do
anything about it, OK?

She can't do anything anymore.

No, this isn't going to work.

This really isn't going to work.

SCOTT WEAVER: I don't like
it anymore than you do,

but we don't have
a choice, either.

[ambient music]

Hey, um, listen, uh, y-y-
you don't need me to fill

any prescriptions or
anything for you, do you?

'Cause I can go down
to the pharmacy.

How dare you ask me that?

What?

That is none of your business!

SCOTT WEAVER: I'm sorry.

I can't stay here.
No, no, no!

I...
SCOTT WEAVER: OK.

I'm not staying here.
OK, all right!

No, no, no, no, no!
All right!

No, no, no, no!
OK, OK, OK.

How about this?
How about this?

Take my room.

OK?

Have my room.

How about that?

I'll stay out here,
and you'll have

all the room you need for...

to do... for yoga.

So.

OK.

[music playing]

SCOTT WEAVER: Yes, hi, hello.

Uh, I'm moving to
Paris in five days,

and my passport
still has not come.

It was supposed
to be here by now.

Um, hey, yeah, I'm sorry.

My sister actually did that.

You can just... you can
knock a few bucks off, OK?

Yes, uh, I understand that.

But it... but it
has not come yet.

So what am I supposed to
do if it doesn't show?

An expeditor?

OK, how much would that cost me?

Oh, $600?

Are you... um, sorry,
hold on one second.

Hey, man!

Hey.

You said it was clean.

That?

That's g... that'll
buff out easy.

You know what?

You can take 200 bucks off.

Or a... here, listen.

3,000 even.

What about that?

You know, your sister
should have been more careful.

Yes, I... yes, I know.

I'm sorry.

Hello?

Hello?


Shit!

I can't do it, Cookie.

Can you please just take her?
It's two weeks.

You won't... you won't
even know she's there.

I'm sorry!

Scott, I've already decided
to move in with my son

and his new wife.

I don't think they're
quite ready for Cindy.

All right.

Sorry about the wait.

And also, I'm so
sorry for your loss.

Now, let's get to the money.

As you both know, your
father and Cookie...

Mm-hmm.

...had a prenuptial agreement,
so she won't be a part

of these estate proceedings.

He made you sign a prenup?

Actually, I made him sign one.

Your father was not
great with money.

The savings,
retirement, and holdings

should just about cover my fees,
which just leaves us the house.

Yes.
OK, great.

How soon can we sell that?

That depends.

Uh, who's Cindy?

Cindy.

What about her?

LAWYER: Yes, well,
uh, the estate is

split evenly between you both.

So if you want to
sell the house,

you're going to need to
get her to sign off on it.

Oh, good Lord.

Uh, Cindy has
had some troubles.

Some troubles?

Come on.

Cindy's a schizophrenic.

Um, when she's off medication,
she's just as likely to sign

her name here as Sheena.

Well, that is a pickle.

[music playing]

You think she'll sign?

Um, I've given up guessing
what Cindy's going to do.

Here.

It's the keys to
your father's place.

I've cleared out all
my stuff, so now it's

officially all yours
and Cindy's, of course.

Of course.

Give your sister
a chance, Scotty.

She might just surprise you.

[fire alarm]


Cindy!

[music playing]

[fire roaring]

What are you doing?

There's a fire.

OK, why are you
just sitting there?

Get some water!

Don't yell at me!


[water splashing]

I put my scarf over the lamp,
because it was too bright.

You could have burnt this
whole building down, OK?

Do you understand that?

Can you please tell me what
the hell you were thinking?

No, because I didn't
know if it would...

Were you... did you not
know if this was real?

real thing, straight

from the horse's mouth.

Cindy?

Did you get the mail today?

CINDY WEAVER: Oh yeah, I
had to sign for something.

I put it on your dresser.

[scotty weeping]

and, and, and you know what?

No, no, no, no, no.

CINDY WEAVER: [inaudible]

Shit.

OK.

Yes, I just want to
make sure I understand.

Sorry, one second.

So when that's done, you
just ship my passport,

and then I just have to
be there to sign, right?

Ugh!

Good.

OK, please, please do
it as fast as you can.

OK, thank you very much.

It feels weird being here.

Yes, I know.

But there's a minor
problem in my apartment.

Like, breathing.

Are you going
to sleep in here?

No.

No.

I'll probably just
crash at Tolbert's.

But listen, I do need to t...

No!

What?

Cookie took the one
picture that I wanted of Dad.

We can... we can get it back.

But just listen to me, OK?

We [inaudible]...

Can I take
something else, then?

Yes.

Yeah, Dad would want that.
But...

Can I take towels?

I need towels.

Take whatever you want.

What if we want
the same thing?

I don't think that we will.

Listen, we need to talk...

OK, I'm going to
make a little pile.

OK, but here's the
thing... it's just

we have to sell the hou...

CINDY WEAVER: Scott?

Yes?

CINDY WEAVER: Do
you know why dad

never wanted us to be together?

Well, um, Dad
didn't really like

me around when he was with you.

Why?

Well, uh, he and Mom saw
things a little differently.

And well, he thought I
always agreed with Mom.

CINDY WEAVER:
About me, you mean?

Yeah, about a lot of things.

[music playing]

Scott.

Scott.

Scott!
What happened?

I have to go to my
therapist, but it takes me

three buses to get there.

Can you please drive me?

They get really mad
at you if you're late,

so I can't be late.

Can you drive me or not?

Can you drive me or not?

Can you drive me or not!

Just... can you calm down
and give me one second?

Stop staring at me.

Oh!

About time.

She wants to talk to you.

What?

Who?


You must be Cindy's brother.

Come on in, have a seat.

She talks about
you all the time.

She's very proud.

Really?

That's news to me.

So you're moving
to Paris, I hear.

Yes.

Why, you want to buy my car?

Cindy's nervous about it...

about you leaving.

Oh, well, it's not like things
are going to be much different.

I mean, we're not exactly close.

And why do you think that is?

Oh, gee, how much
time do you have?

Well, we could discuss
it later today if you like.

Oh, no, no, no.

That's... that's... I didn't...

I... I was not...

sorry, I don't need therapy.

I'm, I'm not the one
that's hearing voices.

So.

You think that's
the only reason

people talk to therapists?

OK.

Uh, thank you for the offer.

But I really should go.

So.

That's not actually
why I asked you in here.

Your sister wants to get a job.

Right.

Oh my God, you're serious.

No, my s... my sister can't work.

She thinks she can.

OK, well, she also
thought that the mailman

was trying to kill her.

Well, I spoke to Cookie.

She agrees with me.
Does she?

THERAPIST: And Cindy
told me your father

encouraged her to get a job?

Oh, well, my father thought
that she was a drug addict.

OK.

Why don't you think
about it this way?

You really want to
move to Paris and stop

worrying about your sister?

Help her get a job so she can
stand on her own two feet.

Are you guilt tripping me?

[music - mia dyson, "fool"]

Therapists cannot
guilt trip people.

Mmm.

not to be a fool.

It comes so naturally to me.

It's all I'll ever be.

I tell myself to grow
up and get serious.

And all I want to be is
an animal that's free.

I tell myself it's
not safe in my head.

[CINDY HEARS EVERY LITTLE SOUND
AMPLIFIED]

where I'm going

to be every day until I'm dead.

Stop it.
What?

I'm not doing anything.

I don't see why
I can't just work

at the restaurant with you.

Ugh, that's not happening.

When's your birthday again?

You don't know your
own sister's birthday?

What kind of brother are you?

Yeah, what's my birthday?

February 21, 1994.

Hi!

I'm so sorry to
keep you waiting.

So as we were talking
about over the phone,

basically the job is
just sweeping up hair

and generally helping out with
whatever the hairdressers need.

Sweeping?
That's very doable.

You can sweep.

Yeah, is it usually this busy?

Would you look at that?

Wow, she's already
ready to pitch in.

And it sure does look like
you could use her help.

What are the hours?

Well, generally,
our most popular hours

are in the morning, so
we'll need you here at 8:00.

OK.

Oh, no, I can't do
that, 'cause I have yoga.

OK, well, surely you can
reschedule that, Cindy.

She's very into her
health and wellness.

Nn-nnn.

This isn't going to
work, 'cause I have yoga.

Yes, you said that.

But I'm sure that you
could move your yoga...

This isn't going to
work, 'cause I have yoga!

So she has yoga.

[beans grinding]

[espresso steaming]


(WITH A MUFFLED
VOICE) So what makes

you want to work
in a coffee shop?

Coffee!

Yes, uh, coffee.

Uh, I don't drink it,
of course... too strong.

Blech!

But, uh, um, I do
like the smell,

and my girlfriend says that you
guys have excellent benefits.

So, um, I don't have any
doctors, though, because...

Well, that's well...
I'm so sorry.

Please, excuse me.
I'm so sorry.

She does have a few doctors...
just a couple of doctors.

Nothing that's... nothing crazy.
Oh, yes, I have doctors.

I mean, I didn't...
I'm sorry, I didn't [inaudible].

I mean, everybody has doctors.

My dad was losing his
teeth, and I'm worried

that it could happen to me.

But if you chew tree roots,
it can get rid of the coffee

stains.

And if you have dreams
about teeth falling out,

it can mean that you're dying.

Um, and I had one last
week, so anyway, what

would my starting salary be?

Cindy, we tried our best, OK?

What am I supposed
to tell my therapist?

It didn't work out!
I don't know.

Make something up.

You want me to
lie to my therapist.

Well...

What kind of a monster
do you think I am?

That's not at all what I mean.
I just think that it's...

Whatever.
You were right.

I'll never be able
to get a stupid job!

OK.

Dude, I didn't even
know you had a sister.

OK, well, if...
if you please could

just give her a busboy job,
I really would appreciate it.

Ugh, I don't know, man.

She looks kind of timid.

OK, she's just...
she's nervous.

She hasn't had a job in a while.

How long?

Never.

Never.

She's never had a job?

What was she, like, in
prison or something?

She can pick up dishes, Bob.
OK?

It's not brain surgery.

Can you please... can you
please just do this for me?

I will vouch for her, OK?
I promise.

You will?

Well, you'll be in Europe.

OK, well, then, uh,
Tolbert will, right?

He'll be here.

Dude, is that your sister?

What is she doing here?

He wants us to hire her.

What?

Oh.

Oh, you're serious.


Can you excuse us for a second?

leave your sister here!

I'm just...

I'm... she doesn't
have anything, man.

OK, I'm trying to help her
a little bit before I go!

You're the one who said
she could never work!

Yeah, I also said that I
had the idea for "Mario Kart."

You didn't believe
that, did you?

I considered it!

OK, look, just please
watch out for her, all right?

Just give her a little
encouragement now and then,

and that's it.

If she runs a car
through that window...

She's not going to run
a car though the window.

Probably.

Oh my...

Yeah, she... she's good to go.

She can pick up some
dishes or something.

You think?

Yeah!

No, you... you can put... you
can put [inaudible] now.

[MUSIC - NATHAN REICH, "TROPHY
ON A SHELF"]

SCOTT WEAVER: OK, let's go.
CINDY WEAVER: [giggling]

SCOTT WEAVER: Whoa, whoa!
OK, OK!

Calm down.

It's not that big a deal.

It's just got a job.
Not that big a deal?

Are you kidding me?

Scotty, it's my first job!

And all because of you.

Thank you.

OK, I'm going to take us
out for ice cream now.

Oh, are you?

Yeah, I'm buying.

OK, well, you don't
have any money, though.

I'll pay you back!

to learn how to draw...

the color shines,
and the sun it falls,

promising to have no end.

The more you pull
the less it bends.

Looking your way...

I'm looking your
way on the highway.

God, this is such a relief!

I was so stressed out
during those interviews.

I thought that I
would never get a job.

Dad would have hated that.

Well, you don't
have to worry anymore,

because they're going to
take very good care of you

at the restaurant.

And I'm sure you'll
do a really good job.

Yeah.

I really, really do hope so.

Things have just... they
have not been easy lately.

Like, I was going
to this yoga class,

and I was making
lots of friends.

Mm-hmm.

Um, but then I didn't
really know how to, like,

tell them about my situation.

Why did you have to?

No, no!
I know!

Right?

Why did I have to?

Mmm.

But my therapist
said that I should.

Um, that was scary, because
these were normal people,

and they didn't know about me.

And so, um, I told them about
the medication and about the

doctors and about the illness.

And, um, then everyone
stopped talking to me,

so I stopped going to yoga.

You know, like, you don't have
to tell people anything, right?

I mean, for me, like, our
past and Mom and Dad...

all that stuff...

I really don't tell
people any of that.

It's... it's none
of their business.

You don't?

No.

But then how do
you make friends?

Enough about me, OK?


This is... we're here for you
to celebrate your first job!

Yes!

Thank you, Scott!

Oh!

are you kidding me?

I'm sorry!

It's OK, it's OK.

[knocking on glass]

It's OK.

Cindy!

Oh my God, is that you?


Oh my God, is that Julia?

Uh...

Julia!

Oh, shit, it's Julia.

Oh my God, Julia!

Oh my God!

Hi!

You look so good!

What?

I do?

No, you look amazing!

Your hair is so pretty.

Oh my God!

Where have you been?

It's been... I haven't seen
you since high school!

Yeah.

And Scotty... the
last time I saw you,

you weren't even shaving.

Yeah, well, that's...
there's puberty for you.

It's...
Aw!

So, um, what are
you doing here?

I heard that you
moved to LA, no?

Oh, yeah.

Um, I just keep a
little house here,

you know, for tax reasons.

Egh!
Egh!

Oh my God!

Cyn!

What have you been up to?

It's been so long!

Yeah!

I just got a job!

Oh my God!

Me, too!

Yeah!

Um, Cindy was the real actress.

Tell me you're still acting.

She was so talented.

I was just her understudy.

So what's the jump?

Uh, I'm a busboy.

In a play or a commercial?

No, in a restaurant
with my brother.

That's great!

Huh!

What is your job?

Oh, yeah, I got the lead
in this new TV series.

SCOTT WEAVER: Oh!

They wrote it for her.

Oh!

JULIA: Yeah, so I'm just in
town for a couple of days

before I fly back
to LA to shoot it,

and then I have to go to Morocco
for one episode, I think.

But ugh!
You know how it is.

I'm jet-lagged just
thinking about it.

Oh, that sounds so rough!

Ugh!

We should go, Jules.

We have to get ready.

Mmm!

They're throwing
me this big going

away party before I leave.

Of course they're
using my house.

Mmm, mmm.

So you two have to come.

No, no, that's very nice.
OK?

You just have to!

But we actually... uh,
we have something right

after this that we're, um...

No, you can miss it.
SCOTT WEAVER: [inaudible]

You're coming.
Prior engagement.

You're coming.
Sorry, [inaudible].

Oh!

Billy's going to be there.

Oh, Bi... Billy's
going to be there?

Yeah!

Do you still keep up with him?

God, you two were
the hottest couple.

I don't know why you
let that one get away.

You two want some ice cream?

Ew!

God, no!

Um, I just saw you through
the window, so I had to pop in.

But I can't believe
I ran into you.

Ahh!

And, um, congrats on,
uh, the busboy job!


Let's get out of here.

Wait, what about... what
about your ice cream?

Don't you want another one?

Ew!

God, no!

[music playing]

yeah, watching the rain fall.

Staring out in the backyard
to find out what went wrong.

When you were in the
kitchen washing dishes,

trying to tell me
it's all right,

and I found out that all
of these little things

will break your heart.

But I guess that's fine,
and that's the way it goes.

I guess that's fine.

And I'm always stuck and
wondering in my mind.

my river runs, yeah.


Oh, shit!

CINDY WEAVER: What are
you doing in there?

I'm just trying to pee!

Do you mind?

CINDY WEAVER: We have
to go to Julia's party!

Ugh.

Cindy, just be...

Cindy?

CINDY WEAVER: What?

Just because she asked
doesn't mean we have to go, OK?

She doesn't... she... she
doesn't even want you there.

CINDY WEAVER: Yes, she does!

She's my best friend!

Oh, Cyn.

You haven't seen
her in 10 years!

And besides, we need to be at
the lawyers' in the morning,

remember?

We have to sign the papers
to... to sell the house, OK?

What, uh... what are you wearing?

I like it.

I don't like what
you're wearing, either.

Cindy!

Look at me, please.

This is a horrible idea.

This is a horrible idea.

Fine.

If you don't want to
go, then I'll just...

I'll just go with you.

Just...

[door slams]

Hey, hold on!

Is it this?
I don't know.

I don't know which one it is.
I can't see any...

any numbers.

Do you see numbers, honestly?

I think it's that
one right there.

Oh my God, this at
the end of the street?

Mmm.

Jesus, this neighborhood.
OK.

Wow.
It must be.

Look at that.

That's like a house out
of a car commercial.

My God.
Oh my God.

This is going
to be interesting.

[music playing]

[horn honking]
Stop it!

CINDY WEAVER: Julia!
SCOTT WEAVER: Stop, stop!

You're making a scene.
Please.

CINDY WEAVER: What?
I wanted to tell her we're here.

Pull in the driveway.

SCOTT WEAVER: I'm not
pulling in the driveway.

It's a party!


JULIA: Oh my God!


Oh my God!

Hi!

Um.


I... I can't believe
you actually came.

Oh my God!

Why?

I wouldn't miss my best
friend's going away party.

Oh!

OK, um, come, let
me introduce you.

Everybody, this is
my dear friend Cindy

and her little brother, Scotty!

Eh, Scott.

We all grew up
together over in Hammond.

Hey!

How are your parents doing?

I haven't seen them in ages.

Oh, yeah, uh, my dad
is dead, and my mom, um...

she lost her mind.

Uh, no, she didn't.

She's just... she's got some
short term memory issues.

No, she moved to
Florida so that she

could get away from me.

No, she didn't.

She just... she moved away
because her husband wanted to.

Do you know where
the bathroom is?

Because I have to go.

I do.

It's, um, just up the stairs.

What are you doing?

Is she all right?

Yeah.

Uh, yeah, she's just...
she's not great at parties.

So.

How have you been?

Uh, Cindy said
that... that you work

at a restaurant or something?

Oh, uh, actually, no.

Um, I'm, uh... I'm moving
to Paris in a few days

to start work on a novel.

You're going to
go write a book?

I am.

JULIA: That is amazing!

Thanks.

What's your book about?

Oh, uh, well, I'm actually...

OK, I'm toying with
the idea of... of using

the form of an epistolary
novel to explore the...

You know what was awesome?
JULIA: Mmm?

"Da Vinci Code."


You should write
something like that.

Yeah.

me, just a second.


She's excited.

How's it going?
Yeah, good.

Cool.

Yeah.

That's a cool haircut.

[pounding on door]

[ambient music]

No!

I don't want to do that.

I really don't want to do that.

I've given you
everything that I have.

I really have.

Because you just
don't listen to me.

But if you listen to
me a little bit more,

you'd understand that
it's all going to be OK.

You just have to believe.

[pounding on door]

[CINDY HEARS POUNDING STRANGELY
AMPLIFIED]

[dance music]

You do, uh... you do a
lot of these events for...

I'm a waiter as well.

So.

More of a fine dining myself,
but, I mean, we're all on the...


...same team.

Did you see that girl?

What is she on?

Billy!

You're not going to
believe who's here.

Who?
Cindy.

Cindy?
Cindy.

My Cindy?

Yeah!

[cindy doing lip trills]

Cindy.

What are you doing on the floor?

You need to get up, OK?

Stop, Cindy.

It's... it's this new thing.

Cindy, get off the
floor right now.

What are you doing?
Cindy, please get off...

What?

It's time to go, OK?

I'm busy.

OK, this is not the place.
No!

SCOTT WEAVER: Let's go!
What are you doing?

Trust me, you're
going to want to leave.

Let's go.
Stop it!

Please.

Come on!


We need to go.

I don't want to go.

OK, well, we need to go.


Cindy!

Billy!

I can't believe it!

Oh my God!

Were you out there doing yoga?

Yeah.

Have you, um, read
the Kama Sutra?

It's really good
for constipation.

Where have you been?

You've disappeared
since high school.

I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know.

I know, I know, I know.

Um, so listen, I actually have
to pack, so we should just run.

Scotty!

I didn't even see you there.

You've grown up.

Oh, that's... I'm actually...

been here for quite a while.

Um, we should actually
head out, for real, though.

No!
Already?

Yeah, come on.
Stay, have a drink.

Oh, no!

I'm not allowed to drink.

Why not?

What, are you in rehab?

Uh, well, yeah, I'm in rehab,
because I'm a drug addict.

No, you're not.

Uh, I'm...

I'm sorry.

I di... I appreciate
your honesty.

I really do.

I was... you know, I was
in rehab for a week.

And I'm a schizophrenic,
and my name is Sheena.

[awkward laugh]
Um, it's not.

We should... we
actually should go.

So if you could... or if
you want to say bye, or...

Oh.

You smell so good!

And your hair is so soft.

And you're prettier than me.

OK, let's...
Um...

...have a hug.

But you... you
are so beautiful.

Thanks.

You... you are, too.

Mmm.
Scotty?

[moans sensually]

OK, well, that's...
Oh!

Oh, oh!
Oh!


That's... we should
probably get out of here.

Come on, let's go.

Are you on your meds, Cindy?

I don't have to talk to you.
Are you on your meds?

I don't have to talk to you.
OK.

I don't have to talk to you!

God damn it, if you
are not, I swear to God.

Pull over!
I want to get out of the car.

We're going home.
Then you can get...

Pull over!

I just want to get
out of this car!

Oh my God!
Jeez!

We are driving!
Pull over!

SCOTT WEAVER: OK!
Give me one second!

Cindy, where the
hell are you going?

I've taken lots of buses.

I don't need you.

You're not my parent, and
you can't tell me what to do.

I'm calling your therapist.

She's my therapist,
and you can't call

her if I don't want you to!

You're not Dad!

Yeah, I know I'm not Dad.

I'm trying to be your brother.

You're not my brother!

You're not my brother!
Uh-huh.

You don't care about me.
You don't call me.

SCOTT WEAVER: [laughs]
You don't see me.

You don't... you
don't do anything!

I don't do anything?
Are you kidding me?

Are you kidding me?

Do you know what
I've done for you?

I've literally sacrificed
everything for you!

When have you done
anything for me?

Huh?
Tell me!

When have you done
one thing for me?

You have a
perfect life, Scott!

I have a perfect life?
Yes!

I have a perfect life?
Yeah!

You got everything!

You have everything!

I have nothing, Cindy.
Do you understand?

It's always been all about you.

All about you, OK?

Poor Cindy got sick and didn't
get to be a star, right?

Right?

Did you know that
Mom... did you know

that Mom once hit me because I
forgot to take out the trash?

Did you know that?

You were running around crazy,
and I got in trouble because I

didn't take out the trash.

It's really too bad that I
didn't go crazy, too, right?

Then I could've done
whatever I wanted.

Yeah!

What did you ever want to do?

What does that even mean?

All right, you want
to move to Paris so

that you can become a writer?
Yes.

Because there's
no way that you

could possibly do that here!

We're not... no, no, we are
not talking about me right now,

Cindy.
OK?

You were normal, Scott!

You could have done anything!

Anything!

You were just too scared!

Yeah!

You were just too scared!

You, you... you just were
my little brother who

wet the bed until he was 14!

That's... th... I was 11!

That's bullshit!

Can you... Cindy.

Cindy, get back in the car.

Please?

I'm going home.

What?

Oh, you don't have a home.

Yes, I do.

I'm going to live
at Dad's house.

The hell you are!

We're selling that house.
Oh, no!

It's my house, too, remember?

Dad said we're equal.
Well, we're not equal.

Hey!

We are not equal!

You know what the difference
is between you and me, Scotty?

At least I know I'm screwed up.

We're selling that house!

Do you hear me?

Do you hear me?

You better be at the
lawyers' tomorrow morning

to sign the goddamn papers!

[music playing]

Shit!

Did she know
what time to come?

Oh, shit!

Where is it?

Cindy!

Cindy!

I know that you're in there.

Open the door!

God damn it, Cindy!

You can't do one
thing for me, huh?

Not one!

I want to sell the house!

Of course you don't, right?

You got to be the center
of the God damn universe!

It all has to be
about you, right?


Cindy!

Shit!

Scott, what are
you doing here?

When's the last time
you talked to Cindy?

Is she still on meds?

Scott, what happened?
Oh, what happened?

It's the same thing
that always happens.

She ruins everything in my life.

Your sister didn't
ruin your life.

Her illness did.

Yeah, same thing.

Is it?

Is that all she is?

Just a schizophrenic.

Not a woman grieving her father?

Not a sister?

You think you're the
only one trying to find

your place in this world?

OK, don't compare
the two of us.

OK?
We're not alike.

No, you're not.

She said she lived in
her shadow as a child.

She said that?

She said when you
walked to school together,

everyone would run up to
her and you'd be forgotten.

No, that's... no, I had...

I had friends.

Let me see if
this rings a bell.

You always felt like you didn't
matter, because your parents

were constantly fighting.

And you felt the same
way when Cindy got ill.

You made all the sacrifices...

followed all the rules...

did whatever you could to
keep everyone else happy.

And no one even noticed.

There are people
you can talk to.

Me... support groups
for families...

No, no!

THERAPIST: [inaudible]
schizophrenic.

I don't... I don't need...
I don't need a support group!

OK?

I don't need... I
don't need medication,

and I don't need a shrink.

I just... I need to leave!

OK?

[music playing]

Ew.
Watch your step.

Thank you.

Can someone clean
this up please?

So, um, have you
seen Cindy recently?

Do you have any idea
where she might be?

No.

Did your sister ever tell
you about the voices?

Um, I...

I never really asked.

Well, the meds don't
get rid of the voices.

They just lower the volume.

The voices are always there.

And they're mean,
and they're nasty.

And they're waiting to take
over, because they know

eventually the
person will just feel

so tired of feeling weak
and vulnerable they'll want

the voices to take control.

That's why they go off the meds.

Because the voices make
them feel powerful.

Um, uh... what about
her boyfriend, DeMarco?

Maybe he knows where she went?

Who?

DeMarco, her boyfriend.

Oh, right.

DeMarco's not real.

What?

No, no, no.

She... she said that...

that the two of them...

Your sister's very sick.

[music playing]

[dryer tumbling]

[dryer becomes louder]

[DRYER BECOMES OVERWHELMINGLY
LOUD]

[DRYER SUDDENLY RETURNS TO
NORMAL VOLUME]

Uh, yeah, she has
to be missing 24 hours

before you can file a claim.

Yes, yes.

I know that, but she
could be dead in 24 hours.

Is she a drug addict?

Would that help?

[cell phone vibrating]

[ambient music]


Look, did... did
anyone see her anywhere?

Ugh.

No, and it was her shift.

Look, man, I...

I want to help you
out, but I don't think

it's going to work with her.

[cell phone vibrating]

Hello?

COOKIE (ON PHONE):
Scott, uh, it's Cookie.

I just got a call
from Cindy, or Sheena?

As she's calling herself?
Wait, wait.

You talked to her?

Where is she?

Where is she?

[music playing]

[knocking on door]

Cindy?

And there?
It's Scotty, OK?

It's your brother.

Can I come in?

Come in, come in.

[inaudible]
All right.

Sit.

Sit, sit, sit,
sit, sit, sit, sit.

Sit.

OK, OK.

I'm glad you're here.

Did you see them?

They're following me.

Who?

Nobody's... there's
nobody following you.

Maria from... is
in the hallway,

and she was watching me.

And Margaret... that bitch from
the kitchen... they're here!

No, Cindy.

Nobody followed you, OK?

There's nobody out there.

I was just out there!

Shhh!

I told Cookie.

She's sending money so
that she can help us.

OK.

OK?

Hey, hey!

These are dangerous!

The electromagnetic waves
can disrupt your brain!

I don't want anything
to hurt you, Scotty.

Do you want room service?

No, I don't.

Yes?

Yes.

Yes.
Cindy, it's...

Yes.

Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

Cindy.

You need to get back
on medication, OK?

It's time to get back
on the meds, right?

OK?

You can hear me?

Cindy.

Cindy.

You know that I'm leaving
in two days, right?

You know that.

So you need to... you need to
let me take you to the hospital

now, OK?

OK?

Please, Cindy, can you just
come with me for one second?

Stop.
Please stop.

Please... can you please... just...

Cindy, Cindy, Cindy, please!
Please.

OK?
Please!

I'm leaving, right?
You know, right?

I'm sorry.

It makes me a... just a terrible
brother, but I'm leaving, OK?

I'm leaving, and you need
to go to the hospital now.

Please... can you just please
let me take you to the hospital?

Please!

I don't know who he is.

What?

He's trying to kill me.

No.

Cindy.
Cindy.

You know me.

I don't know who you are!
You know you.

Look at me.
Look.

No, no, no!
Stop it, Cindy!

He's trying to kill me!


Cindy, I'm just
trying to help you!

Please!
Cindy!

Help me!

Help me!

He's trying to kill me!

Cindy!

Cindy, stop!

I don't know who he is!

SCOTT WEAVER: Cindy!
I don't know who he is!

Cindy!

I don't want to die!

I don't want to die!

Stop, Cindy!

Stop!
Get up, please!

She's my sister, OK?
And she's sick!

Call the police!
Please!

No, no, no!
You don't understand!

Cindy!

Cindy!

[music playing]

[phone ringing]

TOMMY (ON PHONE): Hello?

Hi, Tommy.

Um, it's Scott.

Is my mom there?

TOMMY (ON PHONE): Uh, yeah.

You shouldn't be calling.

It just upsets her.

OK, well, did Cookie call you?

Did she tell you about my dad?

TOMMY (ON PHONE): Yes.

I told your mom, but I
don't know how much of it

got through.

OK, can you just put her on?

TOMMY (ON PHONE): Look, her
dementia only gets worse when

you call and stress her out.
I don't...

OK, can you just put her on
the phone, for Christ's sake?

I just need to talk
to my mom, all right?

TOMMY (ON PHONE):

MOM (ON PHONE):
Sweetheart, is that you?

Yes.
Hi.

Uh, hi, Mom.

It's Scotty.

MOM (ON PHONE): Ugh!

Are you... [giggles]
are you in Paris?

No.

Um, no.

Uh, not for a few
more days, Mom.

MOM (ON PHONE): Ah!

How is everything?

How's your sister?

Um, uh, Mom,
she's off her meds.

MOM (ON PHONE): Oh.

When?

I don't know.

Um, I... I tried...

I tried to take her
to the hospital.

But she ran.

MOM (ON PHONE): Mmm.

Mom, you there?

MOM (ON PHONE): Oh!


Mom, don't... don't cry, OK?

Um, they're going to...
they're going to find her,

because the police are
looking for her, OK?

So they're... don't worry.

They're going to find her.

MOM (ON PHONE):
This is my fault!

This is all... all my fault!

Nn-nnn.

No, don't blame yourself.

It's not your fault, OK?

This is not your fault, and
they're going to find her.

MOM (ON PHONE): Scotty,
she's my daughter!

She's sick, and I
can't take care of her!

(THROUGH TEARS) Um, I'm sorry.

What... uh... what do
you want me to do?

Just tell me... please
tell me what to do!

MOM (ON PHONE): Well,
you get on that plane!

That's what you do.

I'm not going to lose both
my kids to this monster!

OK?
Mm-hmm.

MOM (ON PHONE): Now,
you go to Paris.

OK?

You promise me you're getting
on that plane, Scotty.

Promise me!
Yes!

Yeah!

I will.

MOM (ON PHONE): And
while you're at it,

you tell that worthless father
of yours to go find her!

That's his job, not yours.

OK?
OK?

T- tell him!

Yeah.

Um, yeah, I'll tell him.

MOM (ON PHONE): OK.

OK.

Mom, you there?


[music playing]

OFFICER: OK, Weaver.

Yes, yes!

Finally!

All right, you were look
looking for a Cindy Weaver,

right?

Yes.

All right, so here she
is located at a Travelodge

yesterday.
No, no, no!

No, I know.
I know.

I was at the Travelodge.

That's... that's
not why I'm here.

OK.

So she's found, and I can
take her off the missing list.

Oh.
No, no, no!

She's not... she's
not been found.

She's not been found.

She is still missing.
OK?

Please do not take
her off the list.

OK?

I am just here, because
I need to make sure

that her file's in
order, because I'm

leaving the country tomorrow.

Now, she's... she's listed
as a special circumstance,

is that correct?

She... they'll... they'll know
that she's mentally ill, right?

Not just a... a criminal.

Uh, yep, it's listed.

OK, good.

And that's not just
for this county, right?

They'll know if she
shows up somewhere else.

We communicate.
OK.

Um, and they'll... they'll...
they'll contact the person

that I put down there...
Cookie Weaver, right?

Because, see... I will...
I will not be here.

Look, we deal with
mentally ill patients

literally every day, sir.

Yes, maybe so, but
my sister really needs

to get back on medication.

Well, we'll do our
best to find her,

but we can't actually
make her take her meds.

OK, let me just tell you
something really quick.

I've been around this illness
since I was 12 years old, OK?

I... I got my first pimple on
the way to a mental institution,

right?

I saw my first naked boob
at a psychiatric hospital.

I met my first girlfriend my
sister's rehab center, OK?

That has been my life.

So... so no!

No, Cindy does not get a choice.

You know why?

Because I... I never got one!

[slow clapping]

This guy gets it.

Maybe she'll go home.

Your father once said
whenever she was lost,

she always found
her way back home.

Yeah, she doesn't really
have a home anymore, so.

I'm sorry.

Cookie, I'm... I'm
leaving tomorrow.

I have to go.

I have to.

If... if don't, I just don't
think that I ever will.

So, um, I know you love Cindy.

I do.

Uh, so I'm...

I'm going to pass
the baton onto you.

Now, listen... here is
all the names and numbers

of anyone that can help you.
I've written them down.

OK?

There's the... the
police station.

That's where I filed the
missing persons report.

There's the mobile health unit.

I put my mom on there,
which, I mean, I don't...

obviously, I don't really
know how much help she can be.

Um, now, if... if
they do find her,

they can't force her
to go to the hospital,

so you have to keep trying.

Now, I'll be reachable
by email in Paris.

But... but the only thing
you have to think about...

really, the only
thing is getting

her back on the medication.

OK?

That's the only thing
that really matters.

Medication.

Uh, OK.

I will.

OK.

Th... thank you.

Aw!

Shit!

[van engine revving]

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

[sighs in relief]

[music playing]


Hi.

I am so sorry to bother you.

Um, my sister and I...

we used to live here.

Is there any chance you might
have seen a girl walking

around here looking just...

just sort of crazy?

[door shuts and locks]

[music playing]

I know you.

I know who you are.

You want my money.

Yeah?

You want to steal my car?

Dad's dead.

I killed him.

I killed the bastard.

Cindy?

CINDY WEAVER: I killed him!

I killed Dad.

What are you looking at?

SCOTT WEAVER: Cindy.

What are you looking
at, you stupid bitch?

Cindy, please stop.

Cindy, please.

Please stop and look at me!

Please.

OK, I know you're in there.

I know... I know it.

I know you're in there.

Please?

Don't... don't do it.

Don't!

Cindy, stop!

[horn honking]

Cindy!

[brakes screech to a halt]

God damn it!

Cindy!

Cindy?

Cindy.

I killed Mom.

I killed Mom.

I killed Dad.

I killed Scotty.

I killed Cindy.

Don't listen to that voice, OK?

You listen to mine.

I'm a stupid fuck!

Cindy, I'm right here!

I'm right here.
It's me.

It's Scotty, your brother.

OK?

I'm next to you.

Listen to my voice.

I'm going to take you home.

I'm going to turn
into a diamond.

A big, bright diamond.

Hi, Scotty!

Hi!

We should go, OK?

OK.

Let's go, come on.

Come on.

Let's go home, all right?


Let's go.

Mom's dead.

Dad's dead.

Well, we're still here.

[music playing]

look like my mother

when I've passed out
on our kitchen floor

from fighting drunk at the bar?

Don't I look like
my mother when I'm

jealous and insecure
and throwing

holes through our bedroom door?

I never thought I'd be
cut from the same cloth.

But my eyes burn just like
hers when I'm messed up.

And oh, oh, I thought I'd learn,
but ain't I my mother's girl?

And oh, I never thought I'd
be cut from the same cloth.

And oh, I thought
I'd learn, ooh.

Ain't I my mother's girl?

SCOTT WEAVER: When you
get on an airplane,

they always tell you to
put on your own oxygen mask

first before helping others,
because you can't help anyone

if you're drowning yourself.

It was a point not lost on
him, as he waited patiently...

seat upright, tray table stowed.

But it was a point made
too late to matter.

His struggle was all in the past
now, along with his family...

buried in the shared plot
alongside his expectations

of himself.

So.

What do you think?

I think it's beautiful.

Well, it's just a
start, but thank you.

Am I going to be a character?

Um, there's a character
based on you, sort of.

I always told you I
was going to be a star.

Oh my God.

How are the new meds?

Ugh!

Terrible.

I feel so bloated.

Do I look fat?

No.
I feel fat.

No.

You look fine.

But are they helping,
though, with the voices?

Yeah.

DOCTOR: Five minutes, everyone!

All right.

Save it for next
week, Shakespeare.

I can stay a bit longer.

No, you should go.

It's important that you go.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry that you didn't
get to go to Paris.

Well, it's been
around for 1,000 years,

so I think that it
can wait one more.

I hope you get there soon.

Thanks.

Just don't set my
passport on fire.

Oh my God!
Stop it!

Ow!

I'm such a jerk.

she's attacking me!

No, stop!
They really take that seriously.

OK.
OK, I'm sorry.

You're probably right.

Oh!

OK, I'm calling an Uber.

OK.

Hey!

Do you want to get
a car together?

How would that work?

You would get the
first half of the week,

and I would get the
second half of the week.

OK, Cindy, you know that's
not going to work, OK?

This is just like
the pogo stick.

There is an odd number
of days, remember?

Oh, yeah.

Mm-hmm.

The pogo stick.

The pogo stick!

Oh my God, remember?

Dad got so mad that he
made us throw it away.

Is that what happened to it?

Yeah, he threw it away!

You don't remember?

I don't!

Oh my God, it was
a piece of work.

He really was.

I wish he was here.

Yeah, me, too.

[music playing]

FRIEND: Do you need any help?
SCOTT WEAVER: Um...

COOKIE: No, we're good.
It's questionable.

going to be good.

We're going to do well.
GROUP LEADER: OK.

SCOTT WEAVER: Two more,
and then I'm good.

GROUP LEADER: All right.
You good to go?

Yes.

[interposing voices]

Let's do it.

COOKIE: Oh, wait,
I forgot the cream.

Thank you guys for helping.

I forgot the cream,
I forgot the cream!

I'm sorry.
OK, OK, OK.

Here we go.

Can't do without the cream.
Can't do without the cream.

SCOTT WEAVER: All
right, let's go.

Hey, everybody!

Watch you step.

I think we're all here.

All right.

GROUP LEADER: A big thank
you to Scott for hosting

the group meeting this week.

It's my deepest pleasure.

Here's some coffee.

Anybody need...

I got it, Scotty.

Thank you, Cookie.

Cookies from cookie.


All right, who
wants to share first?

Scott?

Yeah, OK.

Uh, sure.

Hello.

Um, for anybody that's
new, my name's Scott,

and my sister's schizophrenic.

Um, sorry, my
sister is my sister,

and she has schizophrenia.

And that is very
difficult at times, um,

as I'm sure you know.

Lately, it's been quite good.

She is in the hospital
at the moment, uh,

getting some really good care.

She's on a really
good meds regimen, um,

and things are
going pretty great.

I have absolutely
no idea if that

will be the case next week.

But, um, today is
not too shabby.

[music playing]

It takes, uh, a lot of... of...

a lot of education
to really begin

to understand that we
have to differentiate

the person from the illness.

I am living with a
schizoaffective disorder...

have been for the past 16 years.

It's a challenge
when a... a person you

know is no longer that person.

To have them be who
you though we were...

and then suddenly their
face is different.

They look different.

They're... they're
saying things that you

wouldn't expect them to say.

And... and they're just...

and they're... they're
just not your mom anymore.

Our daughter, unfortunately,
does not accept her illness...

um, is fairly reclusive.

And... and it's been
interesting as a family, uh,

and a journey to
accept, uh, the illness.

In my brother's
situation... and this is

the situation for many...
he can't manage his own,

um, um, health care.

That's where I step in...

is to be that liaison for him
between him and the doctors

and understanding...
observing what's going on,

providing collateral
information,

and making sure that the
medication is working.

In the past 15
years, I've been on...

I've tried maybe a dozen
different medications.

Risperidone,
olanzapine, Seroquel,

Dilantin, [inaudible], Celexa.

You know, all these
crazy names, right?

There's definitely something
called caregiver burnout.


Uh, which, uh, impacted me.

I ended up developing
depression myself just

from everything
going on with Mom

but spilling over
into everything else.

Uh, when my mom first
started becoming symptomatic,

I was planning a wedding.

Aw.

Uh, and I wasn't
sure if she was going

to be well enough to come.

The... the bond as a
family is enormously strong,

and it amazes me...

even us going through what
we've gone through... how

strong that family bond is.

It doesn't go away come
hell or high water.

It's important
to realize that 50%

of people with
schizophrenia have a symptom

called anosognosia, when...

where they don't realize
that they're ill.

So it often takes a third person
perspective... like a family

member or a doctor or a
school counselor... someone

with an objective perspective
and someone who can

make that educated assessment.

Support groups... they've
become safe environments where

it's... it's nice to
people who, um, have

traveled a similar journey.

And so they understand.
[interposing voices]

Thank you so much.

You're welcome.

Thank you.

The brain is unknown,
uncharted territory,

and of course there's
going to be stigma.

Because it's natural
to fear the unknown.

You guys are so generous
for taking the time.

[interposing voices]

I couldn't possibly
have learned more.
