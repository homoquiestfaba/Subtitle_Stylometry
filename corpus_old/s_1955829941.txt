          Turn right.

     Smile for the birdie.

Your first time?
                 Yeah, mm-hmm.

And you're innocent,
right?

             No, I'm absolutely
             100% guilty.

         Empty all your pockets.

          What's the blue money?

Deutschmarks. Keep 'em.

    Sit down.

I'll find you a cell.

Don't go anywhere.

Roy, got something nice
for a guy in evening wear?

 <i>(phone rings) </i>

 <i>(woman)</i> Hello,
 Brighton Precinct.

           Oh, this?

     It's my wedding night.

     Oh, no,
     I didn't kill my wife.

    What happened
    really wasn't her fault,

        and it certainly
        wasn't my fault.

   If the Justice Department
   had just done its job,

      I wouldn't have had
      to do it for them.

    No, I mean, look at me,
    I mean...

   I'm not the criminal type.

          Far from it.

    In fact,
    I'm a very law-abiding,
    non-violent person

       living a peaceful,
       quiet life.

    <i>I like to think of myself</i>

   <i>as someone who always tries</i>
   <i>to do the right thing,</i>

      <i>even with my garbage.</i>

  <i>I volunteer my Sunday to help</i>
  <i>the visually impaired.</i>

                 Is that a fact?

             Kid, I got
             a gift here for ya.

       <i>And far from being</i>
       <i>a deadbeat dad,</i>

    <i>I gladly support</i>
    <i>and even lavish gifts...</i>
  Awesome!

   <i>on my ex-wife and stepson.</i>

 <i>(cries) </i>

   <i>Plus, rather than being</i>
   <i>a threat to the community,</i>

    <i>I'm sure I'm considered</i>
    <i>an outstanding neighbor.</i>

      <i>(all)</i> Trick or treat!

My first customers.

     Early bird gets
     all the worms, right?

Well, in this case, candy.
                <i>(boy)</i> Thank you.

   Oh, boy, do you know
   the way to a kid's heart.

      <i>(man)</i> Oh, more candy?
      Goodness gracious!

       Oh, how generous!
       Excuse me.

          Here, hold my lantern.

      There, I want to thank you
      for your kindness.

Oh, it's my pleasure.
Listen, please,
stop back anytime.

               <i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>
               Happy Halloween.
        <i>(kids)</i> Thank you!

     <i>(all)</i>  Trick or treat,
     smell my feet...

         <i>(horn sounds) </i>

      <i>However, no matter</i>
      <i>how honorably we try</i>

    <i>to conduct our own lives,</i>

        <i>there are others</i>
        <i>on this planet</i>

        <i>whose behavior</i>
        <i>we can't control.</i>

     <i>People do awful things</i>
     <i>sometimes.</i>

      <i>Well, a lot of times,</i>

        <i>and, I, like most</i>
        <i>of you, I'm sure,</i>

 <i>have this perverse fascination</i>
 <i>with other people's</i>
 <i>bad behavior.</i>

        <i>In fact,</i>
        <i>evil is my hobby.</i>

        <i>Well, more than</i>
        <i>a hobby, really.</i>

       <i>It's my profession.</i>

         Is it just me,

   or do many of you also
   feel the world is becoming

        a more and more
        hostile place?

    It's no surprise, right?

       Because every day,
       all around us,

     we see examples
     of unethical behavior,

     abuses of power,
     outrageous injustices,

   heartless acts of cruelty
   that attack our conscience

     and, well, repulse
     our sense of fairness.

     So, we can recognize
     when behavior is bad,

     but how do we know
     when we're being good?

             Respect for the law
             is essential.

What laws? Apartheid laws?
Abortion laws? "He" laws?

   And laws are subject
   to change,

   but what is moral has been
   and always will be.

   Morality is forever.

               Even on weekends?

         <i>(laughter)</i>
 The golden rule really works,

but only if everybody
in the world abides by it.

       <i>(Jack)</i> Impossible.

Hey, if you're not part
of the solution, you're
part of the problem.

   That's a good point.
   OK, a guy named Plenides,

  an obscure Greek statesman--

       Don't even bother
       to look him up.

      He's only available
      on parchment.

   Plenides was the first man
   to question the practice
   of pedophilia.

     Now, today, of course,
     child molestation

    is considered a heinous
    and unspeakable crime,

      but back in 400 BC,
      it was legal,

        it was the will
        of the people,

    and it didn't even break
    a commandment.

 There's "Thou shalt not covet
 thy neighbor's wife."

   It doesn't say anything
   about thy neighbor's kids.

       Well, one day,
       Plenides stood up

        and he raised
        the moral issue

     of whether
     it was right or wrong.

     Plenides said,
     "To live a moral life,

       "you must do more
       than required

    and less than allowed."

      What happened to Plenides?

  He was wrestled to the floor

  and stabbed by every member
  of the Senate.

 <i>(laughter)</i>
 So much for speaking up, huh?

           <i>Ironically,</i>

 <i>the night I first got sucked in</i>
 <i>to committing my crime</i>

      <i>began on a high note.</i>

   <i>You see, I'd been looking</i>
   <i>for a new woman in my life,</i>

 <i>and as luck would have it,</i>
 <i>I was really cookin' that set.</i>

 <i>(man)</i> Yeah!
   <i>(crowd hoots and hollers) </i>

    <i>(announcer)</i> Let's hear it
    for the Braxton Quartet.

  Remember, every Thursday is
  Amateur Night at Dixie's.

  <i>It makes it a lot easier</i>
  <i>when someone likes you first.</i>

  <i>That way</i> they <i>have to come up</i>
  <i>with an opening line.</i>

Your high hats
were very crisp tonight.

               Oh, you think so?

Yes, really, you play
so well for an amateur.

                       <i>(sighs)</i>
That didn't
come out right, you know.

         Please, it's the nicest
         compliment I've gotten.

                     Thank you.
You're welcome.

I could swear
some of your riffs
on "Pick Yourself Up"

sounded familiar.

             That's right.
             I steal from all
             the great drummers.

Oh, well, even the stuff
in between sounded great.

         So how come you know
         so much about drumming?

Well, my father was
a jazz percussionist
in the '50s, so...

               Really? Who with?
Oh, different groups.

Herbie Mann, Kai Winding,
Charlie Mingus.

                Charlie Mingus?

         Well, I'm Jack Lambert.
Oh, hi.

       Can I buy you a drink...?
Oh, Gail.

                         Gail?
  Yeah.

                 Gail?
Oh, my date.

Friend.
He's a date friend.

I have to go anyway.
I got a big day tomorrow.

Tonsillectomy first thing
in the morning, so...

     I hope you'll be all right.
Oh, I'll be fine.

I perform plenty of 'em.
                    Oh, doctor.

Yes.
Another time, perhaps?

                Well, I jam here
                every Thursday.

Great.
                     Come back.

I will.

      <i>(TV reporter)</i>

      <i>Luger was reputed</i>
      <i>to be the most brutal</i>
      <i>of Hitler's killers,</i>

      <i>and was nicknamed</i>
      <i>The Beast of Berkau.</i>

     <i>Luger spent the next</i>
     <i>13 years as a fugitive,</i>

  <i>hiding out in South America,</i>

   <i>where he lived comfortably,</i>
   <i>raising a daughter.</i>

    <i>His daughter spoke to CNN</i>

        <i>all those things</i>

                  Good morning,

 <i>(turns radio off) </i>

 Yes, hello.
                     Hello!

   I wonder if I might
   bother you for an easy favor.

             Sure.

                         Ah.

     You see how your tree grows
     over onto my property?

                That didn't used
                to be a problem,

           but now I have put in
           a stone patio,

    and these little--this looks
    like a little plum here--

          What do you call this?
          What is it?

Oh, yes, sir,
it's a mulberry.

       A mulberry? Oh, well,
       that's your problem, see,

           it's your mulberries,

          because they fall down
          and they crack open

     and ooze out and they leave
     this purple stain.

                 Here, you see?

   Now, I can-- look, I can get
   this stain off of my fingers,

        but I can't get it
        off the stones, you see?

     What do you think
     we should do about it, hmm?

Well, if you want to cut
the tree on your side of
the fence, feel free to do so.

               That's good,
               that's very good.

               <i>Danke.</i> Thank you.
Ah, sure.

 <i>(Shaw) He was tried in absentia</i>
 <i>by a Latvian court,</i>

     <i>found guilty of crimes</i>
     <i>against humanity</i>

     <i>and sentenced to death.</i>

      <i>Although Mueller says</i>
      <i>he is innocent,</i>

 <i>all claims of mistaken identity</i>
 <i>have been ruled out.</i>

      <i>The FBI and forensic</i>
      <i>experts worldwide</i>

     <i>have concluded</i>
     <i>that the two photos are</i>

  <i>of the same man--Karl Luger,</i>
  <i>The Beast of Berkau.</i>

        <i>I'm Bernard Shaw,</i>
        <i>CNN, Washington.</i>

    <i>It was hard to believe</i>
    <i>I shared a mulberry tree</i>

      <i>with the most brutal</i>
      <i>of Hitler's killers,</i>

 <i>but the evidence</i>
 <i>was overwhelmingly conclusive.</i>

     <i>(reporters chattering) </i>

   <i>And then again, there were</i>
   <i>those obvious signs</i>

        <i>that he could be</i>
        <i>a mass murderer.</i>

      <i>He was quiet, polite</i>
      <i>and kind to children.</i>

     ...and that would be
     a really lovely place.

     You know, he could be
     playing outside--

                        Hi, Liz.
          You made it!

                         Mm-hmm.
            Good!

 Hello.

                    Marty around
                    anywhere?

     Oh, somewhere.
     Everybody wants
     a piece of him today.

       There he is.
              I'd been there
              one month before--

 <i>(Jack)</i> Marty, congratulations!
                    Jack!

        Well, I guess I'll
        catch up with him later.

Oh, there's some vegetarian
pupus over by the swing.

           Mmm, gotta see those.

 <i>(man)</i> With the heliport,
 I can make it to the cape

in 20 minutes.
           Champagne?

Actually,
we have two heliports--

      one in the office downtown
      and one on the factory
      in Brighton.

     Brighton?
     What did I just hear
     happened in Brighton?

                 <i>(man)</i> Anyway,
                 the big expense
                 is the pilot.

             His insurance rates
             are astronomical.

They found a Nazi war criminal
living in Brighton.

       I read about that.

     I fact, you know,
     he's my neighbor.

       He lives directly
       in back of me.
Really?

Where in Brighton
do you live?

      Near the monument.

               Do you know him?
               What's he like?

      Well, I only met him
      a couple of times briefly.

              He seemed affable.

        Of course, I didn't know
        I was staring right into
        the face of evil.

I know the area--
single-family homes,
good schools.

        But he's a model citizen
        all these years.

           He's mended his ways.
           I say leave him be.

I agree. I mean,
let bygones be bygones.

  That's easy for you to say
  if they're not your bygones.

  But what gives you the right
  to forgive injustices that
  happened to someone else?

        Only the victims
        have that right,

    and they sentenced Luger
    to death 50 years ago.

   Hmm.
              Interesting take.

Are you thinking
of moving?

           Wh-Why? I don't know.

I'm Joel Wayne
with Century 21.

I'd love to list you.

                    I see.

Why are you leaving
so soon?

    I got to go home and change.
    I take someone shopping
    on Sundays.

More volunteer work?
You're turning into
Brother Teresa.

           Hey, congratulations.
    Ahh.

    You're a gifted tax attorney
    and you deserve your name
    on the door.

Yeah, it's down by the doorknob,
but who knows for how long, huh?

         what you always wanted,

                even as a kid--
                money and power.

A lot of people have
money and power now.

I want what

              Yeah, what's that?

         for Max's defense fund.

            It's tax deductible.

               Thank you, Mr...?

             Most of you have
             known me for years,

               some of you
               even longer, hmm?

       You have been in my home,
       I have been in yours.

            We have borrowed
            each other's things.

    You know me.
    You know that I could not
    possibly be some Nazi beast.

          You know I could never
          hurt a fly.

                  You know me.

          <i>(applause) </i>
 <i>(dog barks) </i>

      <i>It was a lousy party,</i>

   <i>and like the boy</i>
   <i>right after he stepped</i>
   <i>out of the plastic bubble,</i>

      <i>I felt contaminated,</i>
      <i>dirty.</i>

       After we pee pee,
       what do we do?

     <i>(boys)</i> Wash our hands.

        And then what?
        <i>(boys)</i> Dry them.

                    On what?
 <i>(both)</i> On the towel.

           Not on your trousers.
 <i>(both)</i> We know.

        <i>(water running) </i>

     <i>(Jack)</i> There's someone
     in here, just a sec.

                <i>(woman)</i> Hello?
                <i>(knocks on door)</i>

    There's someone in here.
    Just a second, please.

Next time, do not wait
till the last minute.

 Be quick.

Excuse me,
I am Inga Mueller,
my father's daughter.

Who are you?
          Jack, a neighbor.

        I live on the other side
        of the back fence.

           Excuse me.

   Please forgive my directness,
   but you are unfamiliar to me.

      I thought you might be
      with the FBI or the press.

They crawl over us like bugs
and make our lives
a living hell.

         I know.
         The FBI interviewed me.

         What did--
         what did you tell them?

Everything I know--
nothing.

       Thank you. We are
       very pleased that so many
       of you showed up today.

They say that Mr. Brownell
is one of the top immigration
lawyers in the country.

Have you heard of him?

           I think so.
           He may have handled
           the John Lennon case.

 The Beatle?
                Mm-hmm.

Anyway, he feels
we have a strong case,

that after so many years,
evidence is lost,

witnesses die,
or their memories
can be faulted.

          OK, so long.

Don't leave!

             Does my father know
             that you are here?

             Come, say hello.

Father, look who is here.
            What?

         The house in back, Dad.

        <i>(growls, barks) </i>

    <i>Ach, ja!</i>
    That's the mulberry man.

               <i>Ja!</i>

       Oh, isn't it nice?

                Oh! Schatzi, no,
                he is a friend.

        No, Schatzi, no.

    No, no, Schatzi, don't.
                Schatzi, no.

       Don't do that.
       No, Schatzi, stop.

                  <i>Nein!</i>
                  <i>Nein,</i> Schatzi!

                  <i>Nein,</i> Schatzi.
                  <i>Nein.</i> Now sit.

            I said don't do that
            to the nice man.

          OK. You don't know me
          so well as the others,

       so I'm especially pleased
       to see you here.

              May God bless you.

Excuse me.
I've got to be going.

Apple cider?
My father made it himself.
       No, I've got to get home.

Do you have family waiting?
         No, I've got to grade
         some papers for school.

  A teacher?
                 Mm-hmm.

Well then, in that case,
you are excused.

              Thank you.

        A splendid man.

          Max is the real victim
          in this case.

        You know,
        Max never misses
        a Patriots game.

In the first place,
there are no war criminals
'cause there was no Holocaust.

Everyone knows
it never happened.

      Have you read this?
Read what?

      There are new facts
      in here that prove--

                 Excuse me.
                 I couldn't help
                 overhearing,

            but did you just say
            the Holocaust never
            happened?

   It was a hoax perpetrated
   by Zionists.

        The real truth
        is all in here.

                Let me ask you
                this question--

                did World War II
                happen?

Of course it did.
What are you
talking about?

              How do you know?
              You weren't there.

             How do you actually
             know it took place?

My father served in it.
He told me.

    OK, so we have an eyewitness
    who lived through the war.

            You've probably seen
            old film footage

           of Germans shooting
           at American soldiers?

     And maybe old
     TV documentaries of Hitler?

      It's the same with
      the Holocaust. There are
      thousands of eyewitnesses.

    Guys, American soldiers
    like your dad, who liberated
    the camps, for God's sake.

     That fact of the matter is
     that both events took place

              in the same time
              at the same place,

              so why believe one
              and not the other?

        Whose side are you on?

                There's no sides
                in this issue.

There are to me, buddy,
and you're not on it!

          Did you just touch me?

Yeah, I'll touch you again!
        That's right!

           Who are you touchin'?
I'm touchin' you!

              You don't deserve
              to be an American!

         <i>(punching)</i>
                  <i>(Jack)</i> Ow! Oh!

      <i>(Jack) The last time</i>
      <i>I lost a fight was</i>
      <i>in the sixth grade,</i>

  <i>and I just stopped</i>
  <i>thinking about it last year.</i>

   <i>And this one wasn't going</i>
   <i>to go away so fast, either.</i>

    <i>(PA) Mr. and Mrs. Miller</i>
    <i>to Admitting.</i>

             Take my gunshot,
             will you?
        Sure.

Jo, can I get
the chart on the guy
with the face thing and--

  Thank you.

                 Comin' through.

Jack? It is you.

It's your groupie, hmm?

          Gail, hi. How are you?

A little better
than you, I bet.

How'd you do this, Jack?
Car accident?

                  No, a fight.

Hmm. From the looks
of that hand, I'd hate
to see the other guy.

                       Yeah.

             But then I started
             to think, you know,

    what would've happened to me
    in Germany under the Nazis?

An intellectual, an academic.

All you had to be
was Jewish, Catholic,

gay, Communist, handicapped,
Gypsy or "other"

and you're
automatically exterminated.

       And you say
       nothing's going to happen
       to this terrible man?

Well, Luger's already
in his 70s.

Case'll be tied up
in courts for years.

He'll probably live out
the rest of his life

next door to me.

           Let it go, Jack.
           Keep your hand still.

      You fought the good fight,
      literally.

I didn't hit anybody.
He st--

 <i>(hyperventilating)</i>
           Keep your hand still.

          OK, relax,
          slow and deep breaths.
          Slow and deep--

 <i>(breathing slows) </i>
                OK, you're OK.

     If this ever happens again,

           blow into a paper bag
           and breathe back
           your own oxygen.

Jesus, what was that?

          Just your body telling
          your mind

          to change the subject.

           Keep your hand still.

Well, nothing's broken,

but the ribs
are badly bruised,

so you're gonna have
general body trauma

for the next few days.

                       <i>(grunts)</i>
Let me help you up here.

I'll get a bandage
on that hand.

All right, I'm gonna
give you something for the pain
that you can take at home.

                   Thank you.
    OK.

You're getting
the royal treatment, Jack.

I'm going
to bandage you myself.
          Oh, wow, that's great.

Sit right there.

OK. You're doin' OK.

My main concern
was that hand.

You're not going to drum
for a while, I'm sorry,

              but it should heal
              completely.

    Good.

            So, Jack, tell me...

   Are you...?

  Well, go ahead.

                Are you married?
     No.

        Do you live with anyone?

Unh-unh, just me.
I live alone.

        OK, well, then,
        what I need you to do is

    soak this hand in warm water
    and epsom salt

           2 to 3 times a day
           for about 15 minutes,

    and then at the end
    of the night, pack it in ice
    for about 20 minutes.

     OK.

                It's important.

  I'll do it.

 But...
      <i>(PA) Code blue, OR-4.</i>

     <i>Code blue, Dr. Holland.</i>

what is your--
             Oh, I'm sorry,
             I got to take that.

           I'll send a nurse in
           to take care of this.
Your personal situation?

     It's like this every night.

        Oh.

          Except next Wednesday.

      Oh.

Can I help you
out of here?

         Yeah, thanks.

        Keep the change.

       <i>Every single fiber</i>

  <i>He'd been sentenced to death</i>

    <i>It was time to speak up.</i>

                     Hi, Kim.
    Hi.

               Airmail,
               special delivery.

Letters to

I hope it's about
those damn leaf blowers.

      Let me tell you something.
      They're nothing!

       <i>(radio host)</i>
       <i>Hello, you're on the air.</i>

 <i>(Jack)</i> I'd like to get back
 to that Luger case.

       <i>I'm gonna need you</i>
       <i>to turn your radio down.</i>
          <i>(feedback) </i>

        <i>(feedback stops) </i>

Yes, I'm calling
about the Karl Luger case.

             <i>OK, we covered that</i>
             <i>last hour.</i>

And so you figure
that an hour is sufficient

to cover one of history's
greatest injustices

and one that continues
to this day as we speak?

       <i>Whoa, there are a lot</i>
       <i>of problems in the world,</i>

    <i>and to be fair, we give</i>
    <i>the same weight to each one.</i>

             <i>In fact, this hour,</i>
             <i>we're covering</i>

        <i>older married men</i>
        <i>obsessed with teenagers.</i>

So now you're comparing
the engineered extermination

of an entire race of people
to aberrant sexuality?

          <i>(dial tone)</i>
      Hello?

     Assholes!

                <i>(Max)</i> My friend,
                my friend.

     <i>(man)</i> Don't worry about
     a thing, all right?

       <i>(man #2)</i> Good night, Max.

      <i>I sensed I was headed</i>
      <i>for trouble</i>

   <i>when I began spending hours</i>
   <i>in my attic watching Luger,</i>

        <i>in the morning</i>
        <i>at his apple tree</i>

    <i>and at night during</i>
    <i>those damned fundraisers.</i>

    <i>My God, I'd been obsessed</i>
    <i>with women before,</i>

      <i>but never with a man.</i>

And I walk over to her,
and I'm trying to relax her

and calm her down
and I said, "I like your hair."

And she has a Southern accent,
and she says, "My hair makes me
closer to Jesus."

It looked like she'd gone
to an ice cream store
to get her hair done.

Three scoops.
So anyway, I bring her...

            Oh, Jack! Oh, honey!

    <i>(moaning) </i>

                   Uh-oh.

I'm sorry, I don't know
what's wrong with me tonight!

            It's OK. It happens.

  Not to me.

          Well, thanks.
          I needed to hear that.

Oh, Gail, it's not you.
I know it.

              Jack, I'm
              the only one here.

           Was I too aggressive?
           Is that it?

             Sometimes
             I have a habit of--

       You know, I like somebody
       and I show it.

No, it's got nothing
to do with you, believe me.

It really doesn't.

    I don't know, Jack.
    Sometimes it's hard for me
    to tell what you're feeling.

       Not tonight--that was
       just one of those things.

   But other times,
   when we've been out together,
   it's like you're not there.

    I know,

but there's a really
good reason for that,

and that is because
I feel so comfortable
when I'm with you

that I feel
I don't have to be there.

              It's a good thing?

Yeah, it's the freedom
to be alone

without being lonely.

             Oh, yes, like being
             with a friend.

   You're driving cross-country,
   neither of you saying a word,

      hours goin' by,
      lost in your own thoughts.

 Exactly.

                So I'm a friend?
      Yes.

                     Great.
     No.

My feelings are
far more than friendly
for you, Gail.

I mean, come on, I-I--
I'm crazy about you.

You've come into my life.
You're just a golden thing.

                        I know.

           <i>(moaning) </i>

                    Jack! Ohh...

                         Uh-oh.
I'm sure it's not you.

   It's rage, Professor Lambert,

        anger at an unfair world

            which is indifferent
            to your just demands
            and expectations.

 Over a lifetime, to survive
 these constant disappointments,

            people make a deal
            with their feelings,

          as if reason
          could deny them a way.

      But the rage,
      the rage lives inside you,

       screaming for expression.

      Unresolved with no outlet,
      it attacks within,

          first as self-loathing
          at your helplessness

             and ineffectuality,

  leading to a sense of weakness
  that leaves you limp,

         and eventually you sink
         into a state of despair

               and hopelessness.

        And as your will
        and your spirit weakens,

              so does your body.

                 Vulnerable,
                 you fall victim

           to tumors,
           cerebral hemorrhages,

            strokes, other forms
            of premature death.

          <i>(bell rings) </i>

       We have to stop here now.

What happens next?

                 We talk.
                 How many years
                 depends on you.

Well, now, listen,
in the meantime,
I need something.

I can't sleep and I'm shaky,
and sometimes I feel like
I'm losing control.

     That's good.
     You're in too much control.

          You live in your head,
          you intellectualize
          everything.

    You need to deal
    with things more viscerally.

        I want you
        to act out your feelings
        so we can examine them.

All right.
            The goal of therapy

            is to find out
            who you really are
            and change that.

            But first, let's
            find you an opening.

Isn't there
some kind of pill
you can recommend?

         I'm the best pill,
         Professor Lambert.

         I want to see you
         six days a week.

      Good.

             But I can't.

      How's every other Thursday
      at 3:15?

  All right.

                   See you then.
         Yeah.

Thursday, Thursday,
every other--Oh. Oh.

                Have a nice day.
 Thank you.

Professor Lambert.

Oh, I see you've
recovered nicely
from your beating.

That's good,
that's very good.

And you needn't worry

about any more
ugly disturbances
in the neighborhood, eh?

I'm going to South America.

              What, on vacation?

  Permanently.

My lawyer's
arranging the details.

I'm going to emigrate
back to Ecuador

where they accept me
as I am.

Ah, so, <i>auf wiedersehen.</i>

         Wait, is this official?
  Oh, <i>ja.</i>

 <i>Ja,</i> I leave in ten days.
                       Jesus!

See, I could stay.
I could stay and I could
fight for my innocence,

but the media
and those Zionists...

 They hound me.

they stink, <i>ja?</i>

    <i>Ja.</i>

Take care of yourself,
good care.

Don't let the bastards

              But this is wrong!

Yeah, I agree,

they will let me

    <i>Ja,</i> so...

      <i>Here's the moderator</i>
      <i>John McLaughlin.</i>

    <i>Issue one:</i>
    <i>getting away with murder.</i>

                 You said it.
 <i>Nazi Karl Luger is</i>
 <i>getting away with mass murder.</i>

                You bet he is!
  <i>How is this possible, Morton?</i>

 <i>Just luck, I guess, John.</i>
              <i>Oh, shut up! Luck!</i>

 <i>Technically, it's because</i>
 <i>Ecuador has no extradition</i>
 <i>treaty with Latvia.</i>

      <i>And if the US avoids</i>
      <i>a very embarrassing</i>

     <i>prosecution of Mueller,</i>
     <i>what's wrong with that?</i>

      Mueller? His name's Luger!
    <i>The man's name is Luger.</i>

   <i>The issue here is justice.</i>
                          <i>Right.</i>

     <i>There's no statute of</i>
     <i>limitations for crimes</i>
     <i>against humanity</i>

     <i>and there shouldn't be.</i>
                       Right!

 <i>(McLaughlin) OK, exit question.</i>
 <i>On an outrage scale of 0-10,</i>

    <i>rate the world's outrage</i>
    <i>regarding Luger.</i>

                 Ten, baby. Ten!
 <i>(Morton) Zilch, zero.</i>

               Come on! Kiss my

   <i>The answer is a minus one.</i>

    See what the boys

     And tell them
    that I'll have the same

   Just see what the boys

      And tell--give them

       And when I die,
      don't waste my money

  <i>You don't kill 700,000 people</i>

 <i>Oddly enough, I had no problem</i>

     <i>He deserved to die,</i>
     <i>so killing him was </i>
     <i>the right thing to do,</i>

    <i>See, since I practically</i>

  <i>I needed to concoct an alibi</i>

    <i>that would place me miles</i>
    <i>from home on the night</i>
    <i>of the murder.</i>

      <i>So the obvious weapon</i>
      <i>had to be cyanide.</i>

    <i>See, it was quick, clean,</i>

   <i>and allowed me to be away</i>
   <i>at the exact time of death.</i>

   <i>And best of all, I knew</i>

 Hey, Jack.

How long does it usually take
for the poison to work?

           Eight, ten seconds,
           depending on the size
           of the rat.

The rat?
A little smaller than me.

    Hey, hey, Jack, Jack.
    Don't ever, ever tell anyone

      I gave this to you.
      I could be in big trouble.

I will not be breathing
a word of this to anyone.

It'll be our little secret.

  <i>I was amazed at how once</i>
  <i>I had decided to take action,</i>

   <i>everything fell into place.</i>

        <i>I knew the who,</i>
        <i>what, where, why</i>

     <i>and how I would commit</i>

        <i>The only question</i>
        <i>left hanging...</i>

                  <i>(Max talking)</i>
         <i>...was when.</i>

Excuse me.
Excuse me, excuse me!

Mrs. Mueller--
Mueller, right?

May I help you?
                        Inga.

          And please forgive me
          for entering your home
          without permission,

        but did you know
        your door was wide open?

Yeah, I was in a hurry
before and I forgot
to close it.

            You bowl also.
Just a beginner.

             May I?
 Sure.

     It is very heavy. Ohh!
               Yeah, it's heavy.

But you know your arm.

I need a lighter one, of course.
I am just a woman.

                       So...
So your house--
just as I expected.

Oh, what a lovely hobby.

Oh, African trinkets,
Italian movies,

American jazz--
an international man.

    <i>Needless to say,</i>
    <i>I didn't want this woman</i>

    <i>snooping around my house.</i>

    <i>What was she doing here?</i>
    <i>What did she want?</i>

  And look at these books.
  Books, rows and rows of books.

               Books everywhere.
               I have difficulty
               reading myself.

    I have a wandering eye,
    but it is hardly noticeable.

                    Look.
Well, I-I-I wouldn't--

            No, no,
            look straight at me,

                now quickly look
                to the left.

Oh, well...
               I never noticed
               your eyes before.

        You were wearing glasses
        last time we met.

Yes, I generally wear glasses.
Sometimes I wear contacts,

but I don't really
like contacts.

               A shame. You have
               compelling eyes.

Thanks a lot.
Was there something you...?

        As you know, my father
        is being forced to leave
        the country.

Yes. That hasn't changed,
has it?

               No, he is leaving
               next week.

That's what I thought.

    And we are throwing a little
    goodbye party for him

          at his house on Sunday

        for all the friends,
        neighbors and supporters

                  like yourself.
                  Are you free?

Sunday day
or Sunday night?

            In the evening only,
            starting at seven.

Seven till when,
do you think?

         Not past 11. After all,
         it is a school night,
         professor.

    Yeah.

Well, I'm glad
you stopped by.

It was very thoughtful of you
to think of me,

        and thank you
        for inviting me.

    I think it's something
    I'd probably like to do.

           So then,
           I will see you there?

Ah, no, I have
a family function
of my own that night.

              Oh.

            Family.

          I like that.

            Sunday.

    <i>The night of the murder,</i>
    <i>I was double-booked.</i>

 <i>First I had to take Gail</i>
 <i>to a birthday dinner for Marty.</i>

     <i>Everybody seemed to be</i>
     <i>having a good time,</i>

        <i>so I don't think</i>
        <i>anyone noticed</i>

     <i>that I had other things</i>
     <i>on my mind.</i>

     <i>I tried to act normal,</i>

  <i>because it was very important</i>
  <i>that nothing I did</i>

    <i>seemed out of</i>
    <i>the ordinary that night.</i>

       <i>(car horn blaring) </i>

Well, that was a rush.

               I'm sorry, honey.

        I've got a lot
        of things to do tonight.

Tonight?
It's already 10:00.

     I know, but I'm preparing
     a new lecture for tomorrow.

           I thought I'd see
           a film on the subject

             and stay at a motel
             on route 10,

         kind of save myself
         the commute, work on it
         in the morning.

I like that you're
so dedicated to your work.

                  Love you.

Love you, too.

I'll get my own door.

                 There it is.

   Call me.

Hold your horses.

                 May I help you?

Yes, I'm curious.
Did you make this
coffee yourself?

                  Yes, what's
                  wrong with it?

    Nothing.

It's the greatest coffee
I've ever had.

 I thought you must've liked it.
 You drank close to 20 cups.

Hi, I'm Jack Lambert.

I teach at Braxton College.

                  Hi, I'm Patti.

I drank so much
of your great coffee,

I kind of lost
all track of time.

How long
have I been sitting here?

           I think you came in
           sometime after three.

No, it was 2:30,
and it's 6:30 now,

so I've been sitting here
for over four hours.

      Would you like
      your check now, Mr. Lambo?

Lambert! I teach
at Braxton, remember?

                Maybe it is time
                for your check.

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to snap.

        You should've stuck
        with the decaf, darlin'.

       Here's your check, <i>Lambo.</i>

   Thanks.

                 Forget the tip.

        <i>(phone ringing) </i>

             Hello?

 <i>(man) It's 12:00.</i>
 <i>Get up.</i>

           Thank you.

       Come on, come on,
       where's the news?

       Oh, one of <i>these.</i>

                             Hi.

      Excuse me,
      can you change the channel
      on the TV for me please?

          I wanna see if there's
          a certain story on.

The one about that Nazi
from Brighton?

           Yes. What, he's dead?

Yep, he killed himself.

         No. Wasn't he murdered?

Not what I heard.
                    Huh?

     <i>...by lacing his ritual</i>
     <i>morning apple juice</i>
     <i>with cyanide.</i>

     <i>Police saw no evidence</i>
     <i>of foul play,</i>

       <i>and Luger's death</i>
       <i>has officially been</i>

   <i>(female reporter)</i>
   <i>Oddly, Luger took his life</i>

 <i>he was despondent</i>

  <i>over allegations linking him </i>
  <i>to Nazi war crimes.</i>

  <i>(male reporter)</i>
  <i>Obviously, Heather,</i>
  <i>this story is far from over,</i>

  <i>and let me remind our viewers</i>
  <i>that there will be</i>
  <i>an in-depth report,</i>

 <i>"Suicide Among Accused Nazis,"</i>
 <i>on the news at nine.</i>

   <i>This has been a New England</i>
   <i>Cable News special report.</i>
   <i>We now...</i>

Satisfied, friend?

     <i>Why wasn't I satisfied?</i>

     <i>He was dead,</i>
     <i>and I was off the hook.</i>

  <i>Hell, the police didn't even</i>
  <i>think there'd</i> been <i>a murder.</i>

 <i>(woman)</i>
 I'm glad he's dead.

    <i>So what was bothering me?</i>

  I hate those damn Nazis.
  I wish they would <i>all</i>
  kill themselves.

         <i>(horn sounds) </i>

          <i>That was it.</i>

  <i>History would record</i>
  <i>that Luger took his own life.</i>

        <i>Unh-unh. No way.</i>

      <i>He wasn't good enough</i>
      <i>for suicide.</i>

   <i>I had to let the world know</i>

      <i>that he was punished</i>
      <i>for his crime...</i>

   <i>without taking any credit,</i>
   <i>of course.</i>

    <i>I mean, getting caught</i>
    <i>was not part of my plan.</i>

      <i>So to set the record</i>
      <i>straight,</i>

   <i>I knocked off a quick note</i>
   <i>to the police.</i>

      <i>(man)</i> "Luger did not
      take his own life.

  "His death was a punishment,
  not a choice.

 "Luger was sentenced to death
 by a Latvian court.

   "Society has an obligation
   to carry out the sentence.

       "When legal means
       failed to serve,

  it became a moral issue..."

      Wait, there's more.

There were other apples
injected with cyanide, too.

The lab boys figured that
they were contaminated
the previous evening.

The coroner, he found
a massive amount of poison

in the victim's system,

and he estimates
the time of death
around 6am.

    Jesus, what if
    we've got an individual

 who decides to kill everybody
 who deserves to die?

   It'll make a lot of people
   in this country very nervous.

      This crime scene's a mess.

          Look at all these
          footprints and debris.

           What the hell's this?

That's sauerkraut.

They had a get-together
that night at the house.

We're workin'
on a guest list.

                        OK, OK,

        what do we got?

   We got a literate letter,

    we got a revenge killing
    by poison

         with the most
         likely suspect
         a party guest.

Sounds like a case

      who was murdered recently.

        Any thoughts about that?

Do you tape these sessions?

                          No.

Whatever I say to you
remains between us, right?

        I am a doctor, and, yes,

  Really?
                     Yes.

No matter what I tell you
about myself or what I've done?

           That's right.
           The only exception is

              if you inform me
              that you're about
              to commit a crime,

         I'm obligated to inform
         the police or alert
         the intended victim.

         However, if you tell me

        about something
        that's already happened,

          I can only advise you.

   <i>For a startling development</i>
   <i>in the Karl Luger killing,</i>

         <i>this is a WCHB</i>
         <i>special report.</i>

 <i>(Inga) If it weren't for you,</i>
 <i>my father would be alive today.</i>

  <i>You encouraged a crazy person</i>

     <i>to commit a vicious act</i>
     <i>of violence.</i>

  <i>You are irresponsible liars.</i>

 <i>We told you all along my father</i>
 <i>was not that Nazi beast,</i>

      <i>but, no,</i>
      <i>you would not listen.</i>

  <i>Now you will know the facts.</i>

    <i>Max Mueller was</i>
    <i>a simple and decent man,</i>

       <i>and now he will be</i>
       <i>remembered as one.</i>

    <i>Shame on you.</i>
    <i>Shame on you, all of you!</i>

          <i>Shame on you!</i>

           <i>Shame on you!</i>

     <i>Go do something useful!</i>

      <i>And so, in Brighton,</i>

      <i>a bizarre case</i>
      <i>of mistaken identity.</i>

      <i>The man murdered </i>
      <i>for being Karl Luger,</i>

      <i>The Beast of Berkau,</i>

      <i>has now been</i>
      <i>positively identified</i>

    <i>as Corporal Max Mueller,</i>

       <i>a lowly cook</i>
       <i>in the German army.</i>

     <i>Mueller's wartime file</i>
     <i>was among documents...</i>
                      No.

     <i>found in</i>
     <i>an East German archive.</i>
                     No!

  <i>Justice Department officials</i>
  <i>in Washington now say...</i>

         I see you're interested
         in our televisions.
    No!

         <i>...the dead man</i>
         <i>is Max Mueller,</i>
         <i>not Karl Luger.</i>

    <i>(Shaw) Israeli officials</i>
    <i>concur with the findings.</i>

  No!

     <i>There's no doubt whatsoever</i>
     <i>in our minds.</i>

     <i>We are completely satisfied</i>

              <i>that the dead man</i>
              <i>is not Karl Luger.</i>

 <i>(Jack groans) </i>

 <i>The whereabouts of</i>
 <i>the real Luger remain unknown,</i>

    <i>and the "Sincere Slayer,"</i>
    <i>whoever he is,</i>

       <i>can now live</i>
       <i>with the knowledge</i>

 <i>that he has taken the life</i>
 <i>of an innocent, sickly old man.</i>

    <i>He probably never harmed</i>
    <i>anyone in his life.</i>

I thought of killing myself,

but that would only continue
the cycle of violence.

I know I just can't go on
as if nothing happened.

I took an innocent life,
and I have to atone for that,

        I want to!

   Whatever it takes!

                Why don't you
                turn yourself in
                to the police?

Are you out of your mind?

I mean, you know,
if the police caught me
for killing Luger, so be it,

but I'm not gonna go to jail
for killing the wrong man.

           I'd go down as one
           of the biggest idiots
           in history.

                My name would be
                a punch line!

Besides, what good
can I do in jail?

That's not the answer.

         So, what is the answer,
         professor?

I'll punish myself.

  <i>(man) Right this way. We have</i>
  <i>a beautiful table for you.</i>

Sit down.
      Thank you.

We have
no specials today,

but you look
through the menu.

I'll be right back, OK?

The lady not show up?

Maybe she can't
find you here.

Why don't you sit inside
with the others?

    No, I asked for this table.
    I want to sit at this table.

             She'll be here.

You wanna order
some appetizer?

       I don't think we're gonna
       get to eat, thank you.

Oh, to drink only
you must sit at the bar.

           OK, I promise
           I'll order something.

                 Here she is.

                 Just, please,
                 leave the water

             and leave us alone,
             will you?

           Hi, honey.

        Sorry I'm late.
                        Gail--

Jack, this table,
all by ourselves,
very romantic.

                       Gail--
Oh, what a day.

I told my mother.
She's thrilled
and horrified.

"You're gonna marry a man
you've known such a short time?"

I said, "Mom, you knew
Dad, what, five days

when you got married?
It lasted 37 years.

37 miserable years,
but anyway--

                    Gail!
   What?

                 I can't come
                 to our wedding.

        I have to be
        someplace else that day.

And where would that be?

                 A funeral.

Oh, Jack, I'm sorry.
Whose?

                 A neighbor's.

Another death
in your neighborhood?

              The same one.

   The Nazi?

              He wasn't a Nazi.
              He wasn't in
              the Einsatz group.

       He was a chef, a cook
       in the goddamn Wehrmacht,
       for--

           A case
           of mistaken identity.

That's very bizarre.

         Anyway, now they gotta
         rebury him as himself.

        The whole thing's
        affected me very deeply.

Well, I understand,
so send some flowers

or a basket of fruit.

             I have to be there.

       OK, we have
       no specials today.

I'm not eating.

                     Me, either.

     Oh, but you promised!

             Ay-yi!

What's going on, Jack?

        Look, you don't know me.

                 I'm no good.

               I mean, you are--
               you're better off
               without me, Gail.

    Oh, God.

      I am so sorry to hurt you.

    You are a wonderful, loving,
    kind, decent person--

So what's wrong?

            I'm unworthy of you.
            I don't deserve you.

Why, Jack?
What's happened?

               I can't tell you.

What do you mean,
you can't tell me?
                 I wish I could.

Of course you can tell me.
You can tell me anything.

                     Not this.
Not what?
What's going on?!

You're not gonna tell me?

                        No.

Jack, please talk to me...

because once I get up
from this table and walk
out the door,

you'll never see me again.

               I can't tell you.

   <i>Breaking up with Gail</i>
   <i>was excruciatingly painful,</i>

  <i>but it wasn't nearly enough.</i>

       <i>I still felt I owed</i>
       <i>a tremendous debt</i>

     And so we say goodbye

     to our dear

                 Thank you.

Listen, if I can be

                 Thank you.
...in any way.

            Thank you very much.
 Anything.

                 Thank you.

I'll call you.

                  Thank you.

 <i>(man)</i> First, they didn't
 want to get involved,

then they supported
the Nazi's murder,

then when they find out
the guy's not a Nazi,
they come forward.

          It's good we have such
          concerned citizens.

You sure it was that
Sunday night you saw the guy?

  Yes, it was the night of
  our daughter's anniversary.

            Uh-huh, and you saw
            the guy's face?

He looked right at me,
and said, "Hi, how you doing?"

Real friendly like.

   So you could identify him
   if you saw him again?

            No, no.
   No, no.

              "No, no"? Why not?

Well, his face was
all covered in black.

All you could see
were the eyes

and his lips and teeth
when he smiled.

                Like a minstrel?

        No, a terrorist.

                  He was wearing
                  a ski mask?

            What kind of a car
            was he driving--

            foreign or American?

American.
Japanese, I think.

   He thinks it was a Toyota,

       but it was taller
       than a Toyota.

 <i>(Inga)</i> My life has been
 totally uprooted.

I am lost
without my father.

He did everything for us.

      <i>Inga Mueller needed</i>
      <i>a shoulder to cry on,</i>

  <i>and I was the perfect choice,</i>

    <i>because I totally agreed</i>
    <i>with everything she said.</i>

Murderers don't realize,

it's not just
the victims that die.

They kill
the loved ones, too.

And this "Sincere" madman--

he is no front-page
TV movie hero,

he is a menace to people.

He should never have
another decent meal.

                     depression.

You OK?

             I do not know
             how I will make it.

         The funerals
         took all of my savings.

      My father's life insurance
      is tied up in probate

    because of the circumstances
    of his death.

           How can I raise
           two growing children?

             How will I ever pay
             for their college?

          Frankly, I am stumped.

         <i>(door opens)</i>
         <i>(dog barking) </i>

       <i>(boys)</i> Hi, Schatzi.

                    Hi, Schatzi.
You look great.

                   Schatzi.

 <i>(Jack)</i> Give all my money
 to Inga Mueller,

but she mustn't know
that it came from me.

              <i>(Marty)</i> Let me
              get this straight.

            You're talking about
            your CDs, your IRAs,

        your insurance policies,
        everything?

Yeah, leave enough
for my stepson's
higher education

and a funeral plot for me,
then give all the rest to her.

                       Why?

Look, just convert it
to cash,

put it in a blind trust
for her and her children.

        No, if you put something
        in a blind trust,

      you can't get to it, ever.

But I don't want it.
I want her to have it.

           What if later on
           you change your mind,

            and you <i>don't</i>
            want her to have it?

I'll never
change my mind!
          <i>(baby cries) </i>

I'm sorry, Liz.

      Look, bro, you're in love,
      and that's wonderful,

             but this isn't
             the way to show it.
             This is crazy!

Listen, Marty,
if you're not gonna
do this for me,

I'll just find
someone who will.

Jack, come on inside
the house.

I swear you are
one of a kind.

They broke the mold
when they made you.

                  Let's hope so.
                  Hi, sweetie.

   <i>(police radio chattering) </i>

 <i>(man)</i> Look at this.
 Come here, come here.

Look, look.

                     Look, look.

            You got scuff marks
            here on this side.

          Any scuff marks there?

     <i>(man #2)</i> There's a lot
     of 'em over here.

         Over here
         and over here.

        There's a bunch
        of 'em.

May I help you?

            Yes, we're with
            the "Sincere Slayer"
            task force.

            You mind if we
            ask a few questions,
            Professor Lambert?

No, not at all.

I don't know much,
just what I've read about
in the newspaper,

seen on television,
just like every
normal, average,

everyday citizen.

       Who lives
       on the other side?

That's where Mueller lived.

      So it's just a hop,
      skip and a jump
      over and back?

I wouldn't--
           You own a blue Volvo,
           don't you, Professor?

  Uh, yes. Why?

As coincidence would have it,
Professor Lambert,

a man wearing a black ski mask
was seen driving a blue Volvo

in the vicinity
on the night of the murder.

We vacuumed around
Mueller's apple tree,

and found these...

from a black ski mask,

which places the guy
in the Volvo...

at the murder scene.

   Well, I imagine there are
   thousands of blue Volvos
   out there.

            There's 238 in Mass,

               26 in the greater
               Boston area,

               three in the city
               of Brighton,

                and yours--
                right next door.

        My Volvo and I
        weren't at home

 or anywhere near the vicinity
 at the time of the murder.

What time was the murder?

 Whenever you guys said
 the guy in the black ski mask

    was seen driving around.

I didn't say.

   It doesn't really matter,

       because I was gone
       the entire night.

       Do you mind telling us
       where you were all night?

           Certainly.

    ...and after the movies,
    I spent a few hours

  at a diner near the campus.

        There's the stub
        from the movie--

      stub and a receipt.

            Keeping a scrapbook?

      No--taxes.
      It was work related.

      Also, uh, there was
      a-a waitress there

     who served a terrific
     cup of coffee.

     In fact, she probably
     signed the guest chit.

              Yes.

         "Thank you...

            Patti."

Thanks for your time.

      It was just a hunch.

            That bit with
            the apple was great.

       He'll come around.

Excuse me?
What do you mean "hunch"?

A hunch about me,
based on what?

I mean,
that is ridiculous.

What motive would I have
to kill the man?

       You attended Mueller's
       last funeral, didn't you?

So what?
You show a little
compassion for people

and it's twisted around
to mean something else?

I happen to be
a very compassionate person.

In fact, I am known
for my compassion.

    Which could mean that
    a compassionate person,
    like yourself,

  sympathetic to the cause
  of the Holocaust survivors,

    might, seeking revenge,
    kill the Nazi.

 Then when you discovered
 you killed an innocent person,

    overcome by guilt,
    you attend his funeral.

     Nonsense.

    <i>They knew, and they knew</i>
    <i>I knew they knew.</i>

       <i>What I didn't know</i>

    <i>was what to do about it.</i>

  <i>(man on TV) Here's something</i>
  <i>that's really sweet</i>
  <i>for your sweetheart.</i>

     <i>The sweetheart clock.</i>
     <i>It's got very accurate</i>
     <i>quartz movement,</i>

   <i>and it's battery operated,</i>
   <i>so it's very reliable.</i>

        <i>Guys, if you're</i>
        <i>in the dog house,</i>

       <i>what a great way </i>
       <i>to redeem yourself.</i>

     <i>If you want your wife</i>
     <i>or girlfriend to think</i>

  <i>you're a little angel again,</i>

       <i>maybe this will</i>
       <i>help her remember.</i>

                Oh--do you mind?

                    Jack...

          Here, this is for you.

What is it?

                 Read the card.

           Oh, out loud, please.

"Dear Jack, your friendship
and kindness have helped me
through the most difficult--"

                Ooh, slow down.

"...the most difficult
period of my life.

"I will forever treasure
the time we spent together.

"My children and I think
of you as part of our family.

"Please accept this small
token of our appreciation.

Fondly, Inga."

            I thought of you
            the moment I saw it.

             It's you, isn't it?

     Oh, it's...

     Thank you.

                It is a memento,

                should we never
                meet again.

Never meet again?
I don't understand.

         I know. Let me explain.

 You know I have not been happy
 these past few months.

       There are so many
       bad memories here.

     I have thought I might
     move to Germany. Hmm?

I phoned my relatives.
They all encouraged me to come.

     They say it is a good
     clean place to work
     and raise a family.

  There are many opportunities
  in the new Europe

      for someone like me.

     So, what do you think?

         I am such a little girl
         when it comes to making
         big decisions.

It's a good idea.
It sounds like something
I'd like to do myself.

                Thank you.

              I am going to miss
              relying on you.

Not if I came along.

            What are you saying?

Well, you know,
frankly I'm kind of sick
of living here, too,

here in Brighton,

where I've been
ever since I got my PhD.

And I've always wanted
to live in Europe.

             But what about your
             teaching career?

Well, ethics is
an international subject.

There's an American
university in Heidelberg.

I'll learn German,
whatever.

                   Jack. Jack.

          Are you saying that...

          you like me that much?

Inga, please have
a seat here

                 and just listen
                 very carefully.

You said that I was
part of your family.

Well, I like being part
of your family,

and it's something
I'd like to continue doing.

        That would be wonderful.

So it's settled.

        That would be wonderful.

Well, great.

                  Wait a minute.

               Jack, you are not
               talking about us

                living together?

   Oh, God, no!

No, I mean,
that never entered my mind
for a moment, that thought.

                    Good.

             I am old-fashioned.

                  Well...

              I would be honored
              to marry you.

        <i>(waltz music) </i>

       <i>Please don't think</i>
       <i>I married Inga</i>

     <i>just because the police</i>
     <i>were on my tail.</i>

 <i>I still needed to be punished,</i>
 <i>and I threw the book at me.</i>

       <i>I gave myself life,</i>

      <i>and I was determined</i>
      <i>to serve my sentence</i>

   <i>with whatever dignity,</i>
   <i>grace and charm I had left.</i>

                      <i>(laughs) </i>

           <i>(humming) </i>

              Ooh!

 <i>(boy)</i> Mommy, there's
 a shuffleboard tournament

in the morning
that we want to play.

   <i>(boy #2)</i> We wanna play
   some videogames, Mom.

Please leave us
some money.

       <i>(Inga)</i> Good night.
       I will.

  It's important.
        I will, I will.
        Good night.

  Don't forget to walk Schatzi
  before you say your prayers.

 <i>(both)</i> Good night, Mom.
 <i>(Schatzi barks) </i>

 The children love you.
 They are so happy.

 Schatzi, however,
 is still a little moody.

                I'm sure Schatzi
                will be fine,

                  once he sees
                  the Rhine!

And I love
my wedding presents.

      Yes, I can see,
      you wore them all at once.

Thank you.

I like the way
you phrase things, Jack.

I think you
are hilarious.

                   Really?

           I don't ever remember
           you laughing at any
           of my remarks.

Oh, often later,
when I am alone,

I will chuckle out loud
over something you have said.

            Why not just chuckle
            when I say it?

I am guarded
with people, Jack,

but when I am by myself,
I am very outgoing.

     Maybe sometime I can be
     with you when you're alone.

You remind me of my father.

He was also very funny.

                 <i>(chokes) </i>

                 More champagne?

Oh, no, one glass
is enough for me.

I'm already
a little too giddy.

 <i>(clears throat) </i>

    Well...

                  So...

 <i>(groaning) </i>

Eee, yeah...

Ahh...

   Mm.

                     Well.

                      Whoa.

                       Whoa!

                   Was good, <i>ja?</i>

         Mm.

        You?

        I don't like having sex.

It gets better with time.

                        No.

                 No, I have
                 never liked it.

             Maybe I should have
             told you first.

You might have
mentioned it,

but it really
doesn't matter.

                   Ah. Oh, good.

     I honestly thought with you
     it would be different...

      because you are so giving.

           I will do it for you,
           of course,

              whenever you want.

                 It is my duty.

Please, Inga, try not
to think about it.

Don't even worry
about it, all right?

I'll see you
in the morning.

                       OK.

                    Good deal.

          <i>(horn blows) </i>

                   Can I get you
                   a washcloth?
No, thanks.

     Remember, Jack, when you
     told me you wanted to share

         all my burdens in life?

      Uh-huh.

           I have always wanted
           to share my life
           with a man.

      My husband was a macho man
      who would not listen.

          Not like you.

          But I feel I can share
          anything with you.

          Can I tell you
          my secrets, darling?

Uh, in the morning, dear.

          My father <i>was</i>
          The Beast of Berkau.

  Say that again.

     My father was Karl Luger...

           not Max Mueller.

That--that's impossible,

because the war files
prove that--

                 No, no, no.
                 Oh, no, listen.

              That file was
              a forgery, a fake.

              My father was
              in SS Intelligence

      and could do these things.

             Late in the war,
             to protect himself,

             he created a file
             for a Max Mueller

            but using his own
            photo identification

             and dental records.

             And so he became
             Max Mueller.

      This file was lost
      during my father's escape.

             We kept hoping
             it would be found.

           It popped up finally,
           but too late.

So let me get this straight.

What you're telling me

is that the man
who was poisoned to death

was really Karl Luger.

                       Yes.

So you're the daughter
of The Beast of Berkau.

                         Yes.

And I'm his son-in-law.
                       Yes.

         Believe me, I know what
         you are going through.

                         Jack?
Could you not--
Just for a second.

          You are the only other
          person in the world
          who knows.

            Promise me, you will
            tell no one, <i>no one.</i>

What, are you kidding?
Oh, no, I'm telling everyone!

        I will deny it.

    I told you
    what it was like for us

     when my father
     was exposed as a Nazi!

         Could you please just--

  To the world,
  my father was Max Mueller!

       I am Inga Mueller.
                   Please wait.
                   I'm thinking.

     I would deny it, Jack,
     to my dying breath for
     the sake of the twins.

                 Fuck the twins!

      I knew I should
      never have told you.

             Of course,
             you'd love to go on

         perpetuating this fraud
         for your own self--

           Inga, there are
           other families, Inga.

                 Yours is not
                 the only family
                 in the world.

     There are millions of other
     families involved in this,

            families who deserve
            to know the truth.

             Don't you care
             about them at all?

  Don't people have any feelings
  for each other at all,
  for God's sake?!

     Stop it!

You frighten me
when you talk this way.

You sound like
that "Sincere" madman.

             I am that madman.

What are you saying?

              I am that madman.

  Is true?
                 It had nothing
                 to do with you.

This is true?
                Listen, listen.

              Please, it was
              beyond my control.

Oh, my God, no.
      Sometimes you're compelled
      to do something.

              You have a feeling
              of what's wrong,

           and you feel
           you can set it right.

      Wait, wait...

You kill the father...
                   Inga, please.

and then you
fornicate the daughter?

                      No, no!
Ohh, what kind
of animal are you?

             It wasn't that way.

    Aah! Aah! Aah!

Oh, God, help me! Help me!

Help me, please, God.

Somebody call the police!
Police!

        <i>(sirens wailing) </i>

                 Jack?
    Marty!

                     Jack!

          Is this true
          that you killed a man?

Yes, but I killed
the right man.

                I don't think
                that's a defense
                in this country.

No, look, they say here
I killed a man named
Max Mueller.

I didn't.
I killed Karl Luger,
the Nazi war criminal.

That's the heart
of my defense!

            Wait. Mueller.
            Is this any relation

            to the lady you gave
            all that money to?

You mean my wife.

  Yes.

Now, she is gonna be
a key witness,

probably for <i>both</i> sides,
if that's possible.

I need to know,
is that possible?

And what's
a hostile witness?

           I'll walk you through
           the arraignment,

      but then you're gonna need
      a criminal attorney,

               a good one.

OK, thanks, Marty.
                  Come here.

     I'm with you on this, Jack.

            You can always count
            on family.

            We may piss you off,

           we may screw with you
           on business,

           but we never condemn.

Good. See you in court.

                  OK. Marty,
                  I got a plan.

             What?

               No plea bargains,
               no deals.

   I think
   that's <i>their</i> plan.

We can make a case,
but we need more
physical evidence.

           Get us an indictment.
    We'll get you everything
    you need.

                   He's our man.
Yeah, I know.

           Docket number 1175-D.

 <i>The State</i> vs <i>Jack Lambert,</i>

felony count,
first degree murder.

       How do you plead?

Your Honor,
could I approach
the bench, please?

                 Get me a trial.

                     Hi.

            I haven't been
            in a courtroom since
            college, Your Honor.

         I'm a tax attorney now,
         but the defendant's
         my brother.

  Interesting.
  Are you prepared
  to enter a plea, Counselor?

         Absolutely,
         but I'm wondering
         if you could refresh me

         on what my options
         are here.

     Certainly.
     Guilty or not guilty.

                 Fair enough,

             but couldn't I also
             ask for a dismissal
             of all charges?

          You can ask.

The State recommends
that no bail be granted.

The suspect was apprehended
fleeing the country.

                  What? Fleeing!

        He was on his honeymoon,
        Your Honor.

  <i>So, I'll get my day in court,</i>

  <i>and the truth will come out.</i>

      <i>But even though </i>
      <i>I committed a crime,</i>

       <i>I solved one, too.</i>

    <i>Hey, you know, that might</i>
    <i>reduce my sentence.</i>

      How did you come
      to arrest this man?

He confessed the murder
to his wife.

             Wait a minute.

           A wife cannot testify
           against her husband,
           I do know that.

         No, you don't,
         Counselor.

A wife cannot be forced
to testify, but she may
do so willingly.

   I don't see her statement.

She recanted, Your Honor,
said she was under
a lot of stress,

was hysterical,
and wasn't sure
of what she heard,

but we have a hunch
she was telling the truth.

Maybe she didn't want
the trauma of a trial,

but the defendant was already
the number one suspect.

There's an overwhelming amount
of circumstantial evidence.

 I think I'm ready to make
 a determination in this case.

    Why don't you two return
    to your places?

   <i>Nice how this thing formed</i>
   <i>a complete moral circle.</i>

   <i>Luger paid for his crimes,</i>

     <i>and I'll pay for mine.</i>

    I am reluctant to accept
    a plea in this case.

  The State may wish
  to characterize its evidence

       as circumstantial.

 I find it merely coincidental.

     There is no eyewitness

     or any other
     corroborating evidence

      placing the suspect
      at the scene.

    This case is dismissed.

     Enjoy your honeymoon,
     Professor Lambert.

     Dismissed? What does
     that mean, dismissed?

              What's going on?

 Um...you're free.

                What, on bail?
No, you're out, period.

Jack, weren't you listening?

The judge just dismissed
the case.

          What do you mean? Why?

They didn't have any evidence.
And when your wife refused
to testify--

          She's not gonna
          want to testify.
          You have to force her.

             What have you done?

Cheer up, kid.
You got away with murder.

           Stop saying that.
           Where are they going?

Shut up and let's
get out of here.
  No, Marty, everybody, wait!

        No, wait! Wait.

 Please--please, there's more.

       Don't you want
       to know the truth?

    You call this justice?!

       <i>I went directly</i>
       <i>from court to bed,</i>

     <i>took a leave</i>
     <i>of absence from school</i>

 <i>and just laid around thinking,</i>

 <i>and I came to one conclusion--</i>

  <i>I'm glad I got away with it.</i>

      <i>I'm a very lucky man.</i>

  <i>Anyway, I received</i>
  <i>an annulment notice from Inga</i>

     <i>postmarked Duesseldorf,</i>

    <i>and surprisingly,</i>
    <i>I got a letter from Gail.</i>

   <i>She'd heard about the case,</i>
   <i>put two and two together,</i>

  <i>and wanted to know the truth.</i>

   <i>So I confessed everything.</i>

    <i>She was put off at first,</i>

        <i>but then she felt</i>
        <i>kind of flattered</i>

 <i>that I thought the worst thing</i>
 <i>I could do to myself</i>
 <i>was give her up.</i>

   <i>She agreed to see me again,</i>
   <i>and we caught up on stuff.</i>

      <i>I explained that</i>
      <i>after what I'd done,</i>

    <i>I didn't really</i>
    <i>think I was pure enough</i>
    <i>to teach ethics anymore,</i>

   <i>so I'd entered law school.</i>
