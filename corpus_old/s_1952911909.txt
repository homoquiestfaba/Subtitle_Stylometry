(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

WOMAN: There. Over there.
There's a spot!

-Come on! Are you kidding? Jerk!
-MAN: Sorry.

-Hey!
-WOMAN: Losers.

Hi, Lee. How's it going?

What's going on?

They totally like you.

What's not to like?

(FUNKYTOWN PLAYING)

Hey.

(EX CLAIMING)

to Funkytown?

Won't you take me to Funkytown?

Won't you take me to Funkytown?

Won't you take me to Funkytown?

That's crap.
Let's go, baby, and check this game out.

-Dane. Don't miss, buddy.
-DANE: What the hell!

Yeah.

Whoo!

Yeah!

SKATELAND

Won't you take me to Funkytown?

Won't you take me to Funkytown?

Gotta make a move
to a town that's right for me

Town to get me movin'

Keep me groovin' with some energy

Well, I talk about it
Talk about it

Talk about it
Talk about it

Talk about
Talk about

Talk about moving

Gotta move on

Gotta move on

Gotta move on

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

-It's open.
-Breakfast is ready.

I'm okay, thanks.

You should be hungry.

Maybe, but I'm not.

Did you look at
the applications I gave you?


-Not yet.
-Those are some strong schools, Ritchie.

I think you'll like them.

Coffee's ready, Mom.

You know there's no stopping her.

I realize that, but I'm really
getting in the meat of this.

I'd like to see your sweet face
while I'm at the table.

How you doing, baby?

-I'm fine.
-You okay for money?

I made a few extra bucks on
the editorial in the paper last month.

Well, here's a 20 anyway.

Don't tell your father.

Okay, guys. Hold still.

Thank you!

-Can I have the salt, please, honey?
-Yes, ma'am.

Thanks.

What do you got going on today, Pop?

I'm headed down to Carthage.

I'm gonna pick up a few more leases
on the Taylor unit.

You know, we're scheduled to drill
our first well in two weeks.

-We got a lot riding on this one.
-Right on.

You should come.

I could walk you through the basics
of running title.

Then we can drive to the location
after lunch.

-Today?
-Yeah.

Shoot. I got plans today.

Maybe next time?

I'm sorry, Dad.

Well, I won't be home for dinner.

I've got my aerobics class
with the girls at the YMCA.

-Again?
-The schedule's always the same, David.

I'll order a pizza. It'll be fun.

Great. Pizza.

Had a bucket of chicken last night.

Maybe we can microwave some burritos
or fish sticks.

-You know my routine.
-What about our routine?

I can cook something.

I'll write you a check
for the pizza, Ritchie.

Mary, don't forget I'm picking you up
at 1:30 for your driver's ed.

I'll be ready!

Here you go, honey.

-Here's the check for the pizza.
-Not there. It'll get wet.

All right, it's on the bed.

DAVID: Cooking a meal.
Just cook one meal.

DEBBIE: Okay, I don't appreciate that.

You're not the only one in this house
with stress and a busy schedule.

-Well, you brought that on yourself.
-Well, it's a good thing I did.

We have everything tied up in this. What
if you don't make a well? What then?

All I'm asking is for you to take care
of your family every once in a while.

You know, the kids are fine, David.

This is about you and your ego.

I am so tired of you trying to
hold me back and make me feel guilty.

Well, maybe you should feel guilty.

(CHATTER ON RADIO)

-Well, well.
-Is Brent back?

Son, he's back, but I couldn't tell you
if he made it home last night.

(DOG BARKING)

Shut the hell up, Sheree!

Hey, Mrs. Burkham.

What, no hug for me anymore, handsome?

All right.

Is Brent home?

Your guess is as good as mine, sugar.

(DOG BARKING)

MYRTLE: Shut up!

MICHELLE: Identify.

My name is Ritchie Wheeler.
I'm a writer.

I like crocheting, kittens,
silent films about trees.

-Made us a mix tape.
-Awesome.

-Where was I?
-I'm almost ready.

I prefer capitalism over socialism.
Schopenhauer over Nietzsche.

-Is Brent here?
-(SCREAMS)

-Who's the king?
-You... Get off me.

-Hmm? Hmm? Who's the king?
-Get off!

-Who's the king?
-Get off!

Who's the king, Ritchie Rich?

You are. You are, okay? You're the king!

Yes, I am the king.

(ROCK OF AGES PLAYING)

Yes!

You okay?


Yeah, than fade away

-When did you get back, B?
-Last night.

Blew it out over McCann Street

with those two flautas,
Carter and Wheatley.

Oh, no, those girls are such sluts.

Special girls,

and they deserve medals for their
commitment to visual excellence.

-I was home, dirtbag.
-Couldn't do it, man.

Three's a treat
and four is way too much meat.

Ew!

And besides, I thought
you'd be hanging with Deana.

I haven't seen her, man.

So why are you back? I thought
the circuit lasts through October.

Man, I took a bad spill at Omaha.

I was doing this long stretch
of whoop-de-dos,

and I got side swiped by this punk,

Marlo Hanks, slammed me into the hay
going about 80.

Banged my shit up!

That blows.

How long are you down for?

Give me a beer.

So you keeping an eye on this girl here?

Any boys been around?

I can take care of myself, Brent.

And, no, there haven't been any boys.

What about Boofer T on prom night?
You must've forgotten about him.

-Hey, nothing happened!
-Right. Ow!

Man, I can't wait to see Kenny.

How's his sister?

Samantha. I've been meaning to tell you.

The last time she was in town,
she could not shut up about you.

Brent this and Brent that.

Yeah. "Brent's so cool
and so ruggedly handsome."

I know. It was annoying. Right?

Really?

-No.
-No.

-No, no, no. Not even close.
-Man, that's mean.

It is. It's hatefulness
and it's playing with my emotions,

-and I really don't appreciate that.
-RITCHIE: There's a chance.


Say yeah!

We're gonna burn this damn place down

Down to the ground


Z28.

Now that is a sweet ride.

You know,
this car just paced the Indy Five,

but they used a highly modified,
350, 5.7 liter V8,

which is not, and I repeat,
not available to the general public.


Yeah, man, but Kenny's
has crossfire injection.

-Wow! That is so interesting, boys.
-Damn straight.

Anytime you want
to put your old black knight up

against this bad boy, you let me know.

or the knowhow.

The Camino can't even decide
if it's a car or a truck.

-That is a very good point.
-Thank you.

-You guys don't know shit.
-God, I need a beer.

Right on. Beer's on ice in the back
of the boat, baby. Whoo!

So you say.

(BRENT CHUCKLES)

How's your sister?

(SHAKE IT UP PLAYING)

(ALL CHEERING)

I mean, the 'stache is cool.

I've had so many more girls say,
"You have a 'stache,"

-which makes me feel special.
-If you say so, man.

Like that guy.
Who's that old guy out on the dock?

-Which one? The big one?
-Yeah.

The one with the really hot chick.

Man, you ought to know who that is.
He used to do your sister.

-Hey, boys. You having fun?
-Kenny, yeah!

Dude, you throw the best...

-The best jams.
-The best jams.

-Right on. Right on.
-I mean, these are better than concerts.

-Way better.
-All right. Hey, enjoy.

-What's mine is yours.
-Yeah, man, you make me tingle.

-"Tingle"? Who says "tingle"?
-Sounded good in my head.

Well, I spy...

No one fills a pair of Jordache jeans
like Deana Trammel.

Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

Hottest chick to ever grace this town.

Hard to believe
that was once your property.

Hard to believe?

I know, hard to believe.

Man, every time I throw
one of these things,

I end up knowing about 25%
of the chicks here.

Well, that's 75%
who might let you do them.

Come on, man.

I got a bottle
of my dad's scotch downstairs.

-I'm gonna lower my standards.
-And improve your chances.

-Whatever works.
-Later, Kenny.

-All right.
-See you, man.

I'm so gonna be like him one day.

Look at his hair.

Does it make you tingle?

MICHELLE: ...but the atmosphere
is a bit stuffy.

I mean, who wants to go shopping
in a place where there's no windows?

I love the mall.

(THE TIDE IS HIGH PLAYING)

Are you guys hiring?

I'll ask.

But don't you work at Brookshire's?

I was till Tommy punched
the night manager in the face.

Why? I mean, I didn't even know
you were still with Tommy.

I'm not,
but he hasn't figured that out yet.

Oh.

-Vance, the Horsemen are coming.
-Really? The Four Horsemen?

Yeah, the Four Horsemen.

-That's who you're talking about?
-Yes.

So, I heard your brother's back in town?

He is, yeah.

By all means, help yourseIVes.

Why don't you shut the hell up, faggot?

Do you know where he is?

-Candy!
-He's actually up...

I gotta go.

Assholes.

You go over there
to fight the Four Horsemen,

-you're gonna get your ass kicked.
-Lee, I... No, I wouldn't.

-Dude, I would sweep the floor with them.
-Every time.

I'd make them look like the horse that
changes colors in that movie with all the...

It would take half of one of them
to beat you up.

"AIVy, I tell you this

"because, as an artist,
I think you'll understand.

"Sometimes when I'm driving
on the road at night,

"I see two headlights
coming toward me, fast.

"I have this sudden impulse to swerve
the wheel into the oncoming car.

"I can anticipate the explosion.
The sound of shattering glass.

"The flames rising out
of the flowing gasoline."

-I'll be damned.
-I can never get enough of that.

I missed you, man! I missed you.

It feels good to be home.
I'm telling you, man.

I love it here.

The big pine trees, lake,

beautiful women.

That does not sound
like the Brent Burkham who left town.

I'm just saying

it's good to be home.

Alternatively,

this place is lame.

The people, generally, are narrow.

They lack ambition
and are indifferent to what they eat,

-listen to, or see.
-(STRUMS GUITAR)

You need to get out of here for a while.
Get some perspective.

-All right? You'll see what I mean.
-I was thinking about that.

I was thinking private investigator,
maybe Hawaii.

"I will say, Magnum,

"based upon my extensive knowledge
acquired with MI6, it is entirely..."

You're hammered. Give me that scotch.

Yeah, I am hammered.

Hey, Burkham,
I was gonna show you that thing.

We should go check on that.

What?

Oh.

-Yeah, the thing in the...
-In the thing.

Hold on.

Where you going? Hey!

Easy, tiger.

Hey there, Ritchie Rich.

Are you trying
to get to the bottom of that bottle?

Well, yes, ma'am.
I heard there was a prize down there.

-You look good, Ritchie.
-Thanks.

Teddy has me doing the limbo a lot,

and I've been polishing so many wheels
you wouldn't believe.

I think you can actually
see the lines in my biceps now.

In certain light. Yeah?

Right there. Yeah.

-(SINGING) I'm gonna lose my old lady
-Down to the ground

Brent! Brent Burkham!

When did you get back in town?

I came back just to see you.

I don't believe you for a second.

No, really.

Hug's over.

What do you think you're doing, dickweed?

Tommy Dildo.

I mean Doedash.


I mean Dillday.

-Doe.
-Dillday.

Still a half-assed bike rider?

Yeah.

Yeah. You still

the leader of the Four Horsemen?

There's just three of you.


Yeah, 'cause Medlin's in jail, asshole.

Is he in there with your pop?

Well, that must be nice for them both.

-You want some, queerbait?
-The kid's all right, States.

How you living, Tommy?

Ritchie, this has nothing
to do with you, man.

-What have you been up to?
-Nothing much.

-You still pulling pipe?
-Yeah, Monday through Friday.

Good for you.

What are you laughing at?

Hey, take it easy, Billy.

I mean, this is a party after all,
gentlemen.

Hey, Tommy. Enjoy on me, huh?

Actually, me.

We were just catching up
on old business, Rich.

Right, Tommy?

Just stay away from my shit, Burkham.

I'll be seeing you, Candy.

(HORSEMEN CHUCKLING)

I like your party.


What's up, baby?

Wheeler?

Next time you see someone
starting shit with me,

you don't hand him a glass bottle.


(LOVE PLUS ONE PLAYING)


Is it down to the lake I fear?

Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya

Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya

Ring, ring, ring, ring

La, Ia, love plus one

Ring, ring, ring, ring

Shoelaces can be pretty tricky.

Hey, wait up!

There you go, boys.

-Hey, Jen, how you holding up?
-Hey, Ritchie.

The ice machine's a little slow again,

but I brought in a few bags
from the back.

Good. I'll let Teddy know.

Murphy party's ready
for their Coke floats.

Okay. I'm on it.

-Thanks.
-Thanks, Ritchie.

All right, kids.
Everyone in the Dollahite party,

proceed to corral number three
for the gift exchange.

Everyone else, turn your attention
to the center of the rink

for Lula the Clown's
patented moonwalk skate.

(KIDS WHOOPING)

Hey, Teddy.

The ice machine's down again.
I thought they fixed it yesterday.

Yeah, they tried,
but the compressor's going out.

It's actually cheaper to get a new one.

The smoke machine jammed up
on me last night.

I couldn't turn it off and it looked
like a damn bomb went off in here.

Well, I can get someone out here
to take a look at that.

Don't worry about it. There's no point.

No point?

from Donnell Pipe to buy this place.

Donnell Pipe?
What would they want with Skateland?

Moving in the market
and they like the location.


They're probably gonna
turn it into a big old warehouse

and stack some heavy equipment outside.

Turns out that this land is, well,

it's worth a lot more
than what the business is,

if you can even call it that.

I thought we were doing all right.

Granted it's not like a few years ago.
It's probably just a cycle.

Look around, Ritchie.

Ain't nobody skating anymore.
They're all in parking lots and discos,

and birthday parties and video games
just ain't covering the overhead.

Look. I know you like this place,
Wheeler. I do.

Okay? But you ain't gonna be
sticking around here much longer.

I won't let you anyway.

It wasn't an easy decision, you know,
but like I always say,

"You gotta make the hay
while the sun shines."


Yeah.

NEIL ARMSTRONG:
That's one small step for man,

one giant leap for mankind.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

MAN ON TV: After 10 years together,

exclusively here on MTV this evening,
we are going to see Kiss...

What are you gonna do with all of those?

I'm making a collage
for the yearbook wall

and a family collage
for the bathroom wall.

-Not my bathroom.
-Our bathroom, and why not?

-All right.
-Thank you.

-I'm headed out.
-Wait, I need to talk to you guys.

Can you have a seat for a minute, Ritchie?

Yeah.

-What's going on, Dad?
-What's wrong?

Something's happened,
and I haven't said anything because

I thought your mom wanted to be here.
But I haven't seen her. So...

What is it?

Your mother and I are getting a divorce.

-What?
-Where's Mom?

I don't know, Son.

When did you guys decide this?

I'm sorry. It's not my choice.

Then whose choice is it?

Your... Your mom.
She didn't want counseling.

She's got her own life now.

I just want you two to know
this has nothing to do with you.

This has everything to do with us.

I understand, pumpkin.
What I meant to say is

it's not your fault.

We broke promises.
We made some poor decisions,

and we've been together a long time.
People change.

I don't know how to keep her here.

I'm here, Dad.

Son?

You have anything you want to say?

I don't know.

(HEART OF GLASS PLAYING)

Once I had a love and it was a gas

Soon turned out had a heart of glass

Seemed like the real thing, only to find

Much of mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine

Soon found out I was losing my mind

It seemed like the real thing
but I was so blind

Much of mistrust, love's gone behind

In between

What I find is pleasing
and I'm feeling fine

Love is so confusing
There's no peace of mind

If I fear I'm losing you
it's just no good

You teasing like you do

Once I had a love and it was a gas

Soon turned out had a heart of glass

Seemed like the real thing...

RITCHIE: You know, you should really try
to get a job as one of those VJs.

You certainly know enough
and love to talk

-and talk and talk.
-Hey, one of us has to.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

What about you?

Plans in the making
after you hang up the skates?

I don't even want to think about it.

What a shocker.

That would require you
to make a decision.

I was actually thinking about applying
for something at the mall, like you.

-I'm in high school.
-You were in high school.

Exactly.

Really?

You still have my Skateland essay?

Yeah, I love that.

Ran into Deana the other night.

Mary said she stopped by the house.

I'm not sure what to make of it.

Rich, she hasn't talked to you
in forever.

I know that.

But we were together for a long time.

Maybe it's time for a change.

What did you have in mind?

I've decided to look into schools.

Oh.

Where?

Junior college. Or wherever.

I've already made a list of potentials.

Really?

Yeah, really.

That's quick.

I've gotta get out of here.

Yeah.

You should, too.

Yeah.

I mean it.

Skateland closing is one of the
best things that's ever happened to you.

That's just sad.

I didn't mean it like that.

My parents are getting divorced.

WORKER: Pull it out!

CLIVE: Check to see if those rod boxes
are worn out!

Okay, that will do!

-CLIVE: Help me out here.
-BRENT: I got it, Pop. I got it.

CLIVE: That's it, kid.

All right. Easy does it.
Watch for the guide rods.

-BRENT: It's good.
-CLIVE: Yeah.


-Hey, Mr. Burkham!
-CLIVE: Hey!

Looking to do some real work?

RITCHIE: No, sir.

But I think Kenny here is interested.

Just here to pick up Brent, Mr. Burkham.

-Where you headed?
-Big Woods.

I'll see you tomorrow, Pop.

-Stay out of trouble.
-Yup.

-Hey, boys!
-KENNY: Stinky man!

So, one night,

after I won the hilltop sectional
in Oakland,

one of the sponsors takes me
to a high-rolling joint

for dinner with some of the other riders
to celebrate.

-How high-rolling?
-The best.

Steak, lobster, martinis.

-Expensive wine. Unbelievable.
-Bitchin'.

You haven't heard anything yet.

So, the sponsor,
I think his name was Arty or something,

brought his smoking hot wife with him.

Foxy flauta, man. I mean,
she had the perfect lips and legs.

(SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING)

She was like a firecracker. Boom!

-Whoa!
-Flautas, baby.

-And she's eyeing old Brent.
-Flautas!

But dinner wraps up,
and we're standing outside...

Hey, what did you have?

(MUSIC STOPS ABRUPTLY)

-To eat?
-Yeah, yeah.

That's a good question.
I don't remember.

You don't remember what you had to eat?

So, dinner wraps up,
and we're standing outside,

-and the husband...
-Arty.

(MUSIC STARTS AGAIN)

Arty, he has to make a red eye,

a late flight, that is,
to catch a different race,

and he's leaving the old lady
behind overnight.

-I know where this is going.
-You know it, baby.

She slips me her hotel key.

So I go up to my room
and do a quick brush to the daggers...

Wait. You're in the same hotel?

(MUSIC STOPS ABRUPTLY)

Yeah.

-Awesome!
-Awesome!

(MUSIC STARTS AGAIN) So,
I clean up a bit, head over to her spot,

I open the door,

and there's champagne and chocolates
all laid out on the table,

candles burning, everything.

And I suddenly realize
that I am the prey.

-You had no control in the matter?
-No control whatsoever.

(EX CLAIMING)

She pours me a glass of bubbly,

pops a couple chocolates in my mouth,

tells me to lie down on the bed,

then she walks into the bathroom.

Just then, the phone rings.

I pick it up, and on the other end
of the line is a man's voice.

-No way.
-No way.

And the man says,

"Hello, Brent."

BRENT: Hello, Brent.

-The husband?
-The husband.

It's the freaking husband,

my sponsor!
And he tells me this, get this,

"Take care of my lady! "

BRENT: Treat her well.

-Holy balls!
-Balls of fire!

So I say in a nice, cordial way,

"Well, thank you, sir. I will."

Then she catwalks out of the bathroom
with leopard lingerie and ears.

-Her blonde locks flowing out underneath.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

-Ears? What do you mean?
-(LAUGHING)

Little ears.


Swingers. Cougar on the prowl.

Hot!

So, to answer your original question,
I will never get married.


-That was not my original question.
-That wasn't his original question.

-You sure?
-I'm pretty damn sure, you drunk SOB.

I asked if your parents were happy.

Oh.

Really?

To answer that question, I'm surprised
they haven't killed each other.

-It's a hate-hate relationship.
-Huh.

And that's why
you don't want to get married?

That, maybe,

-and all the lovely ladies out there.
-I'll drink to that.

I don't know, man.

I could see myself settling down.

And I always thought
there was one girl out there.

Yeah, well, so did your dad.

Yeah.

I'm an asshole.

I didn't mean it.

(THANKING IN SPANISH)

MARY: Hey, how's the writing going?

RITCHIE: Poorly.

I filled out a couple of applications
for you.

-Do you have time to go over them?
-No.

Not right now.

We need to get these in so that we can
be eligible for the next semester.

There are a few junior colleges
in the area.

You don't really need to apply.

You can take care of all
your easy classes and save money.

Give it a rest, Mary. All right?
Now is not the time for this.

Okay, then when is the time?

This thing you do doesn't work.
All right? It hasn't worked.

Try worrying about yourself.

Because Mom and Dad, they're done.

So you need me here. I don't
really have a choice, either way.

We don't need you.

You have no idea
what's around the corner.

For all we know,
Dad will have a nervous breakdown.

Why are you doing this?

Dad's fine. If you were ever home,
you would know that.

What is that supposed to mean?

You spend all your time
with your friends, that's all.

You just said
you wanted me to leave, Mary.

Run off to some college.

So which is it? You want me here or not?

I want what's best for you,
and college is what's best for you!

You can do anything!

You're selfish!

You have a seat.

You do not talk to your sister that way.
Am I clear?

Yes, sir.

We are all going through
a difficult time right now.

It does not give you the right
to act like an asshole,

especially to your own family.

I understand,
but she keeps pushing me on this.

Trying to organize my whole life.

Do you know
how important you are to her?

Do you know
how much she looks up to you?

-Yes, sir.
-Then act like it.

I know you got a lot on your mind, Son.

I've been there.

I was 32 years old and had two kids

before I felt a sense of pride
and ownership in what I was doing.

You've got options,

and that presents a whole other set
of challenges.

Regardless of the path you take,
the relationships you form,

they'll define you.

Your success, your happiness.

And that starts right here.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Ah!

Ritchie Wheeler.

Ritchie Wheeler.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

Ritchie.

No server experience. Question mark?

The major plus about Wayne's Supermart
is the competitive selection.

I mean, where else can you find
anything from hairspray to toys,

to guns, to sheet rock,
to men's underwear?

-What kind of underwear are you wearing?
-Excuse me?

Look how the light shimmers off the
tapered edges of these fine pants.

Mmm!

I personally installed the super
Firestone spectacular bulbs above you

so the shadows don't play tricks
on the customers' minds.

As you can see, I've been the manager
at Skateland for the last four years.

Mmm-hmm.

We served hot dogs and sodas
and everything like that.

-Hot dogs?
-Yes, sir.

Sodas?

For example,

that piece-of-shit suit you have on

almost looks wearable under these bulbs.

Just like that, shit turns to shimmer.

We also have the widest selection
of rod and reels on God's green earth.

-Do you fish much?
-Not really as a hobby.

Well, that's not important. What's
important is that you do something.

Now, I can tell by looking at you

that you're probably into
more traditional sporting activities.

This ain't the Sonic, son.

I can't have my waiters serving
high quality, grade A sirloin steaks

on skates, now can I?

No, sir. I wasn't implying
that we would be on skates.


You thought I was serious.

You smell that?

That's just the smell of good people
running a good business.

So when can you start?

You dig?

Don't worry
about the experience thing, Ritchie.

These girls around here
couldn't serve water to a lake.

What do you say you and l

go into the refrigerator?

See if you know your cuts of meat.

(ELECTRIC A VENUE PLAYING)

Now in the streets there is violence

An-na-na lots of work to be done

Hey. Thank you.

I've been dying for this all day.

We're gonna rock down to Electric A venue

And then we'll take it higher

I swear, if Chris plays
Electric A venue one more time,

I'm seriously walking out.

-I like that song.
-You would.

Nice suit.

Yeah, I feel ridiculous.

Can you imagine me
wearing this thing every day?

-No. I think it's really you.
-Oh, really?

I don't know what I'm doing.
Everything's changed.

Ever since I woke up this morning,

I've been walking around
feeling like I'm somebody else.

This isn't my life.

Everything hasn't changed.

-You brought me an lcee on my break.
-That doesn't count.

You still have highly questionable
taste in music.


But you do look pretty ridiculous.

Where did you find that thing?

I don't know.

DEBBIE: It's all right
for a little while, don't you think?

RITCHIE: Yeah, for a while.

And there's a second bedroom

so you guys can spend the night,
if you want.

Mom, if you want me to stay here
with you, just ask me. Okay?

No, babe. That's okay.

You've got your room back at home
with all your stuff.

I just wanted you to know
there's a place for you here with me.

Where's this one go?

I don't know.
I've got to go through all that.

Why don't we sit down and eat
before our pizza gets cold?

I...

I saw you with your client.
That jewelry guy.

The other night at Monaco's.

I'm sorry.

I wanted to talk to you about that,

but I just needed to work things out
with your father first.

You wanted to talk to me about what?

(DEBBIE SIGHS)

Jimmy and I have been close friends
for a long time,

and he really cares for me.

He knows how to take care of me.

What do you mean?

How long a time?

Well,

it started back when
we started working together,

so it'll be seven years now.

Seven years?

-Like when I played soccer with his kid?
-Honey,

I know this may seem shocking to you,
but it shouldn't.

And you know what it's been like
between your father and me,

as long as you can remember, I'm sure.

We just didn't work.

And

I've had other relationships.

Why are you telling me this?

Now? I mean, why'd you stay?

-I don't get it.
-I stayed for you and for Mary.

I stayed to protect you.

You stayed to protect us? From what?

Yes.

From discovering too soon

that things

are not always what they seem.

No. They certainly aren't.

(FOLK MUSIC PLAYING)

(WOMAN GIGGLING)


You know your braces
will get stuck together?

-Naughty.
-BRENT: Ritchie!

Where are you?
It's dark as shit in here.

Language, man! Language!

-Slow down! I'm not good at this.
-Come on.

It's a lock-in, man.
You can't talk like that.

Hi.

Listen, you guys shouldn't be here,
all right? Let's go. Come on.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Nice move.

Dude, Susan Thompson is babysitting
and she's throwing a jam.

-Let's jet.
-I don't think I can.

-Teddy's the only one here.
-Well, we just talked to him,

and he said it was cool.

Really?

Yeah. He was really understanding.

That's great.

-I'll just say goodbye then.
-No, no, no.

He said he doesn't want to be
bothered right now.


Go out front.
I'll meet you guys in a few minutes.

No making out. No making out.

(I RAN PLAYING)

She throws some pretty great parties.

Hey, what's up, Susie?

Beers are in the fridge inside, guys.

So you say.

-Hey, man.
-Hey.

Hey, have you met Kelsey?

Keely.

Keely.


I never thought I'd meet a girl like you

Meet a girl like you

And I ran

So, I was about your age
when I won my first race.

It was on a KX60 water-cooled bike.

You look like you could be a racer, too.

You got that natural build.

You really think so?

What about me?

Hi.


Oh, yeah. You, too.

I know plenty of chick riders who could
give any guy a run for their money.

Well, my mom says it's too dangerous.

She doesn't have to know, now, does she?

ALL: (CHANTING) Chug! Chug!

-Hi!
-Hey.

Hey, Joe.

Ashley was with Brian yesterday.

Hey.

Hey, I have a serious question for you.

Why isn't there a New Milwaukee?

That's too deep.

(URGENT PLAYING)

(MAKING A SQUEAKY SOUND)

-I think I'm the oldest one here.
-No.

Well, yeah, you kind of are.

I know.

All my friends are having babies.

Maybe you should follow their lead.

Or not.

I'm still in training.

I like you with Candy.

Well, I think you're
the prettiest girl here.

Well, thank you.

-Who's that over there?
-Uh-uh.

No. Come on.

BRENT: Who's the king?

Look who's here.

Look who's here!

What happened to you at Monaco's?

I saw you at the bar.

-I'm sorry. Something came up.
-Mmm-hmm.

I've been meaning to call you.

You can't keep a pretty girl waiting, Rich.

I know. I know.

I don't think you do.

-But I love you anyway, sugar.
-RITCHIE: Is that right?

Hey, can I drive your car?
Come on. Can I drive it?

Dude, just up the driveway.
Just a little bit.

That would be crazy.

You talk to me after a few more beers.

All right, I'll have a few more beers
and then I'll drive your car.

-That's cool.
-I'm not high

enough.

(ALL LAUGHING)

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

-You guys be cool, all right?
-VANCE: All right, man.

LEE: Doesn't he just have a great walk?
He does have a great walk.

-Bye.
-LEE: Kenny's got the...

I'm so jealous of her.

He had that cast on for, like, a month,
and they never found out who did it.

Where the hell's Burkham, Ritchie?

Hey, easy, man. He's not here.

Don't you lie to me.
I know he's with my girl.

-Hey, what's going on?
-Hey!

Say one more word, faggot,
and I'll waste you.

Relax, guys, all right? He's not here.
He left about an hour ago.

He said he's gonna go to McCann
for a proper drink.

(POLICE SIREN WAILS)

You tell him his ass is grass.
I don't give a damn who he is. Okay?

(POLICE CHATTERING)

Get on the foot!

-We've got to jet!
-No shit, Sherlock!

-Dildo's looking for you.
-Great.

-I'm sick of those pricks.
-They're nuts, man!

All they do now is drive around
looking for someone to fight.

I'll show them nuts.



-Come on, out the window.
-What?

-Come on. Let's go.
-Good night.

-Come by later?
-You better.

My jacket! Nice catch.

Michelle!

-Hey, sis!
-We're all cruising over to Dairy Queen.

No, thanks.

You should meet us there.

Why?

Why not? I want to hang out.

BRENT: Let's go, man!

And did that idea
just come to you as you

and Brent were swinging from the trees,
trying to make your getaway?

Huh?

You're clueless sometimes.

Hey, what's with the drama?
I just wanted you to come.

No, you have no idea what you want.

But maybe if you and Brent drive
around for a couple more years

and drink a few more beers,
something will come to you.

Hey, why are you so angry?

Let go.

Why are you doing this?

I'm not doing this.

I'm leaving.

-Fine.
-Fine.

BRENT: Let's go, dude!

(HORN HONKING)

Seriously, man?

What?

How the hell are we going to
eat all that?

-We?
-Yeah.

This is mine.
I didn't know you wanted anything.

I'm hungry for a Hunger Buster,
Ritchie Rich. Now get in here.

I'm good.

Your sister's been hitting
the town lately.

How do you feel about that, hmm?

I remember when she was just a tiny
little midget running around naked.

Yeah.

And I remember when your sister
was running around naked

in my bedroom last night.

How do you feel about that?

You're gonna be
one fat-ass bike rider. Damn.

Yeah.

About that.

I'm at the end of the line, bro.

You're at the end of what line?

My sponsors dropped me.

Holy shit.

I haven't qualified for a race
since Thunder Valley,

and we don't have the cash
to keep it going.

-Michelle never said anything.
-Yeah.

Only my old man knows.

That's heavy.

I'm fine.

I had a great run
and I had a great time doing it.

I knew I couldn't race forever.

And I'm okay with that.

How about you?


I've actually been thinking a lot
about that.

I've come to the conclusion
that I have no fucking clue.

I don't really care right now.


Yeah.

That's right, Ritchie Rich.
You be selfish for once.

But not with that beer.

Hand me one of those
golden cans of luxury.

Get out of the car, Burkham.

TOMMY: We've got horses, too!
Let's ride, boys!

-Damn it!
-You okay?

Yeah. I'm good. You?

I told you those guys were nuts!

Car! Watch out!

I'm gonna smash your skull in, boy!

I'm gonna eat you, boy!

-Can you lose them?
-I can lose anybody.

Get out of the car!

Watch out!

God, man!

Reach out and touch him, Danny!

I smell pain tonight!
I'm coming for you, boy!

I'm gonna eat you, Ritchie Rich!
You hear me, boy?

Coming for you, Burkham!

That's all you got?

(HORN HONKING)

Put your seatbelt on.

-What?
-Put it on!

Got it!

Car coming up.

Got it. Got it. Hold on.

(HORN HONKING)

Go! Go!

Whoo!

(HORN HONKING)

This is not a good idea.

(MEN SHOUTING)

DANNY: I'm gonna kill somebody!


(ENGINE STARTS)

Trust me. That's always the move.

Nice work, Burkham.

What a perfect night.

-Brent!
-(HONKING)

Dance all night, play all day

Don't let nothin' get in the way

Dance all night, keep the beat

Don't you worry about two left feet

Who's the king now?

You are dead!

Ritchie?

(SIRENS WAILING)

RITCHIE: Don't move.

You're hurt.

Easy. Easy, buddy. Easy.

(BRENT GROANING)

I'm okay.

Brent!

No.

MAN: Here we go.

We got you.

We need you to lie down here.

All right?

Can you hear me? Lie down.

CLIVE: Get out of my way.

(MICHELLE SOBBING)

Shit, boy.

(DOORS CLOSING)

Sorry about earlier.


Me, too.

Are you all right?

Yeah. I'm okay.

You want to talk about it?



(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

Hey, Rich.

It's coming along.

Ported the cylinder, modified the forks.

It's gonna be a mean bike.

Maybe the baddest we ever built.

-I'm gonna go say hello to the girls.
-Yeah.

(MAN SPEAKING ON TV)

Hi, Mrs. Burkham.

RITCHIE: Hey.

MICHELLE: Hey.

My dad bought me that bike
for Christmas when I was 10.

Yeah.

He got one for my mom, too.

He was determined to make us
a motocross family.

I remember that Christmas.
Your uncle crashed one of those bikes.

He was showing off
and it went right out from under him.

And everyone's standing
on their front porches watching.

Man, Clive was fuming.

Come on.
Let's get out of here for a while.

And go where?

I don't know. Anywhere.
It doesn't matter.

I...

I don't think that's a good idea.

Why not?

I just can't do it anymore.

Can't do what?

This.

Us. Whatever this is.

-I'm not sure...
-I'm leaving, Rich.

I don't know where, but I'm going.

I have to get out of here.

Were you gonna let me know
about these plans?

You don't talk about plans, Rich.
You don't make plans.

about making plans, but I just...

-Don't know what you want.
-I thought I did.

You thought you did?

Yeah.

I just can't...

I can't figure it all out
at this moment, Michelle.

Well, I've already figured it out.

And right now,

I just need to be by myself.

For me.

Oh.

All right.

Okay.

(DOOR CLOSING)

(ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST PLAYING)


Steve walks warily down the street

With the brim pulled way down low

Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet

Machine guns ready to go

Are you ready?
Are you ready for this?

Are you hanging on the edge
of your seat?

Out of the doorway the bullets rip

To the sound of the beat

RITCHIE: There you go.

Man, those buns sure look fun.

I should have started coming here
a long time ago.

Hey, you got another roll of quarters?

-Get out of here.
-(EX CLAIMING)

Man, can you believe the energy in here?

I haven't seen this sort of turnout
in years.

Best things in life are free.

You don't appreciate it
until you lose it.

"Loss is nothing else but change,

"and change, my friend,
is nature's delight."

Well said. You've got honors.

All right.

I just want to give everybody a sincere
thank-you for coming out tonight

on our big, final sendoff.

For one last time, everybody turn to
the center of the rink.

Let's get ready to limbo!

(LIMBO ROCK PLAYING)

Let's go.


Gonna do the limbo rock

All around the limbo clock

Jack be limbo, Jack be quick

Jack go under limbo stick

All around the limbo clock

Hey, let's do the limbo rock

Limbo lower now

Limbo lower now

How low can you go?

First you spread your limbo feet

Then you move to limbo beat

Limbo ankolimboneee

Bend back like a limbo tree

Jack be limbo, Jack be quick

Jack go under limbo stick

All around the limbo clock

Hey, let's do the limbo rock

(MIMICS GUN FIRING)

KENNY: Ritchie!

Let him go, man. Ritchie, let him go!

Get off him.

Look at me, it ain't gonna change
nothing, okay? All right?

It ain't gonna change nothing.

God damn. Breathe, son.

Breathe, wake up. You're gonna be okay.
Just take a breath. All right?

-KENNY: My sister's coming in next week.
-RITCHIE: That's great, man.

Yeah. Sam's bringing in
some of her model friends, too.

That should make
for some stimulating conversation.

That's not the stimulation I had in mind.

'Course not.

So where's your girl?
I haven't seen her in a while.

My girl?

Yeah, your girl.

It's the first time all year
you've been out here without Michelle.

I haven't talked to her.

Her mom said she's visiting
some schools down in Austin.

I think she's ready to leave
this place behind her.

When are you going to peel
the wrapper off that, Wheeler?

It's not like that.

It's always like that.

Yeah, maybe so. I think I blew it.

Thank you.

KENNY: You want to head up McCann later?

I need to run by Skateland.
Help Teddy close shop.

Maybe after?

End of an era.

Something like that.

Hey, you know I wasn't serious earlier?

I know how you feel about her.

I can't think
about anything else right now.

She's a great girl
and you're not ready to let her go,

so don't.

Sorry I'm late.

Don't worry about it. Just finishing up.

I've got me a date with
a spicy little waitress from the REO.

-Right on.
-Yeah.

Can you believe some rink owner
from Abilene bought all this stuff?

Good luck to the poor bastard.

-Abilene, huh?
-Yeah.

-Hey, you think they're hiring?
-You haven't had enough yet?

I'm joking.

So, how are things?

Not bad.

Yeah? You sure about that?

You know.

This year's been tough,
but like all things...

-It too shall pass.
-It too shall pass.

Hey, I tell you I got a Winnebago?

-What? No way.
-Yeah. That's right. I'm going on tour.

That's great. Good for you. Where to?

I'm thinking, do some fishing
up near Creede, Colorado.

-Creede.
-It's a place my daddy used to take me.

And then, after that, I'm not too sure.
You know, just out of the heat.

Just out of the heat.

I can't believe I've been here
for almost 20 years.

-Damn, that's a long time.
-Yeah.

Well, make sure you keep in touch.

Will do.

Teddy, thanks for everything.

Come here.

-Do you mind if I lock up?
-It's all yours.

And you made me smile

For a little while

I was falling in love

I was falling in love

Falling in love

Falling in love

Okay, are you ready?

I've only driven
in a parking lot before.

Parking lots, streets,
what's the difference?

There's a huge difference.
Namely, other cars.

We'll stay off the busy roads. Okay?

Ten and two! Scoot.

(ENGINE STARTS)

So, I heard you're going to be
Dad's new business partner?

I don't know about that.

But I'm gonna work
with him for a while, yeah.

We'll see.

Well, I think that's great.

Start getting over
to the right lane up here.

-Blinker.
-Got it.

Have you talked to Mom yet?

Yeah, she's gonna take me to the mall
this afternoon

to do some Christmas shopping.

She wants us to come over
for dinner soon, too.

Dinner with you and Mom
sounds really cool.

I'm serious.
Two of my favorite ladies in the world.

-RITCHIE: Look both ways?
-Yes. Didn't you see me?

-No, no.
-Well, I did.

Hey, did you boys know that today
in Vostok Station, Antarctica,

it was the coldest day
recorded on Earth? Ever!

It was negative 192.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

That's negative 89.6 degrees Celsius.

Man, that is really chilly.

That's fascinating, Mary.

But that's the lowest
reliably measured temperature.

Oh.

That's interesting.

-More iced tea, gentlemen?
-No. I'm good. I'm good.

-Thank you very much.
-Welcome.

This is great, guys.

All Mary.
I just put the ice in the glasses.

That's not what I meant.

I know, Dad.

Hey, I forgot to tell you.
You got some mail today.

Really?

-Mary?
-Yes?

Ritchie, you did it!

I didn't do anything.

"Dear Mr. Wheeler,
please accept our scholarship invitation

"to the Honors Writing Program
at the University of Texas."

-Did you apply for me?
-Me? No. I promise I didn't.

-College acceptance?
-I guess so.

"The essay you submitted
entitled 'Skateland'

"is an intriguing vision
of contemporary Middle America."

Ritchie, how'd they get your essay?

(I MELT WITH YOU PLAYING)

using all my breath

Making love to you was never second best

I saw the world thrashing
all around your face

Never really knowing
it was always mesh and lace

I'll stop the world and melt with you

You've seen the difference
and it's getting better all the time

There's nothing you and I won't do

I'll stop the world and melt with you

The future's open wide

Hey.

Hey.

I know what I want.

You do?

The future's open wide

Oh.

I didn't think
they'd give you a scholarship.

You're going with me.

I know.

You do?

That was the plan.

I'll stop the world and melt with you

I've seen some changes
but it's getting better all the time

There's nothing you and I won't do

I'll stop the world and melt with you

These words lie inside they hurt me so

And I'm not the kind
that likes to tell you

Just what I want to do

I'm not the kind that needs to tell you

Just what you want me to

I saw you this morning
I thought that you might like to know

I received your message in full
a few days ago

I understood every word that it said

And now that I've actually heard it
You're going to regret

And I'm not the kind
that likes to tell you

Just what you want me to

You're not the kind
that needs to tell me

About the birds and the bees

Do you find this happens all the time?

Crucial point one day becomes a crime

And I'm not the kind
that likes to tell you

Just what I want to do

I'm not the kind that needs to tell you

I've lost you, I've lost you,
I've lost you, I've lost you

I've lost you
