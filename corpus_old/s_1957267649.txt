Let's send it out to
Aurora Hakiki who has more.

[electronic whirring]

They look like regular

Mm.

but Trioxin 245 enhanced
spiders are not garden pests.

They're rad, they're

Ooh, what do I get for that?

It could be territory.

No, the riders never come up here.

They're way too superstitious.

But keep your eyes open.

Do you think it's true?

What they say about the Northlands?

people never return?

Think you can chock that

than any kind of war ghost.

[wind rustling]

[suspenseful music]

It's a graveyard up here.

I can see why Sliv and the
others didn't wanna come.

You came.

I won't forget that.

I couldn't let you go by yourself.

Besides, if there is any
water stored up here,

I couldn't let you get
all the praise for it.

What? Are you insane?

It's the only way we

No, I won't allow it.

You think I don't know

Where we're going, you
won't need eyes to see.
