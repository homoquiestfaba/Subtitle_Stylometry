Just me.

Drop your weapon!

<i>We are Code Orange in Sector 3.
This is not a drill.</i>

Show me

It's nothing personal.

What isn't personal?

Mina, where are you?

<i>Tatiana, go, save yourself.
It's too hot.</i>

Mina.

So, what's it gonna be?

What's what gonna be?

The new name of
the restaurant?

I think the space is
too small for

"Bitch Who Broke My Heart
and Took Half of My Shit."

Dudeâ€œ.
What? Too soon?

You can change it to
Catalina Spanish Bitch-re.

You know what
you need, man?

You need to get out
of Brooklyn.

Cat's gone, Jules,
that's a fact

whether I'm here
or somewhere else.

That's right, but, look,
we need to go somewhere' too.

Take your mind off the whole
restaurant thing and this chick.

Emmett' cut that on the bias. On the bias.
You know better.

Hi' Michelle. Let's see what you've got.
Looks good.

Needs acid. Just a little
bit, though' okay?

Sure.

How you doing, man'? Anthony.
Hey. Ray Boudreaux.

Welcome to the Big Easy.
Love it.

Ain't that big, ain't
always <i>easy,</i> but it's home.

He retired. But your little friend

Okay, she used to eat all

Jambalaya. All the gumbo.
Everything,

The dirty rice.
Ate it all up.

Went to the ass. To the hips?
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah...

Well, yeah.

In fact, she said one of
you guys can stay with her

'cause I only got
one couch upstairs.

Okay, well, then, uh, look, I'm
gonna stay upstairs with Big Ray.

Yeah, that's all right.
And' uh, you know...

Go on and take
that for the team.

Stay with Simone.
Okay.

But she's good. She's

You'll like her.
So that's not her?

I missed you!
Wow! Look at you!

You look great!
Uhâ€œ.

Look at...
You got so big.

And you got so small.

But like a good
small, though.

Yeah?
You look so good.

Oh. Is this your friend?

Anthony, nice
to meet you.

I think I'm staying with you.

Oh, I was just telling
Anthony

with Big Ray upstairs.

Well, whatever
you guys want'

I know what I want.
Want me to show you inside?

Cool, all right. I'M
go ahead and, uh...

See you

Yeah, take care.
All right.

Uh, you know, Antoine,

guests in my house

Oh, it's Anthony, please.

It's my pleasure. I like
to earn my keep' you know?

You want to come over here
and taste this stuff?

Ah, no, no, no, no.

I'm looking forward.

<i>MAN". Big Ray.</i>

Um' listen, y'all

extra to eat tonight.

No, no. Just bring a
little somethin'-somethin'

All right. Come on m. Get
this food in here. Come on.

Angie?

ls any of
this vegetarian?

All right, come on.

All right,
who wants the good stuff?

Antoine, he made
these ribs.

Okay? Come on.

Lord, we would
like to thank you for

bringing this strong
family together today.

And thank you for the bounty
that you have placed upon us.

In Jesus' name, amen.

And thanks
for bringing the beer.

So rude!

Who made all this?

I miss food.
Yeah.

Hey, Big Ray, you tried
that sauce with the ribs?

Oh, yeah. The sauce
was wonderful.

Right?
Mmm-hmm.

Did you try
that sauce?

Did y'all try
the barbecue sauce?

What are you doing with
yourself these days, Jackhole?

Jay, um, lives
in New York.

I'm a private investigator.

A what?
A private dick.

And, uh..

Private detective,
or dick.

I'm a dick, okay?
I'm a dick. All right?

Bullshit.

I don't know why
it's so funny. It's true.

We have an office space
we just leased out.

We solve cases.

<i>Yes, we some oases.</i>

We've gotten cases.

How many cases?
A lot of cases.

Yeah, we...
A lot of cases.

We had one big case
that put us on the map.

But then all of the rest of them
were like little branch cases.

Uh, cheating husbands, alimony
checks not being there.

Child support things, those cases.
We had a murder case.

So' you're in people's
drawers and pocketbooks?

Something like that. You know.
Hey, sex sells'

What's the name of
this crackerjack outfit?

It's called the Juan
Detective Agency.

You and who else?

You and who?

You and me.
That's okay, Jackhole,

y'all probably just
in it for the pussy.

But that's a good reason
to be in anything.

Ain't that right, baby'?
That's what I'm talking about.

Hey' Hey.

What's going on?

From the Halls of Montezuma.
Wilson.

Hey, hey.
What's up, man?

I was wondering when
you were showing up.

What's going on, man?

You all right, brother?

Hey, come and have
a seat, man.

Excuse me for being rude.
I'm sorry.

My military
friend here, Nina.

Hi.

Pleased to meet you.
Welcome.

Come on in.

<i>So you don't
remember anything?</i>

It's just a blank.

Doctors say that it probably
won't ever come back.

But I saw
the official story,

and it just doesn't
make any sense.

They said it was
a training exercise.

What kind of training exercise kills
the three highest-ranking officers,

his sergeant
and a doggoneâ€œ.

Civilian.

Yeah, a civilian.

Civilian?

Stripper.

There's rumors going
around that she was...

You know me' Jay.

I love the ladies' but I
would never hurt nobody.

You know that

<i>Now, they're saying it's
some kind of gang rape gone wrong.</i>

Now, look, my cousin
may have blue balls

and absolutely zero game,
but he's no rapist.

So you want
to clear his name?

Yeah, and it wouldn't
hurt to gain some points

with the southern
relations.

Look, I know I got you into this
competition, and now I'm asking you toâ€œ.

Nah, man, don't worry about that.
I'll drop out

No, I'm not saying that
I'm saying we do both.

I say we clear my cousin's
name and win the contest.

What do you think?

I say we got
our next case.

My man.

Let's go inside,
it's cold.

You have failed
in your mission'

The Wolf still
needs the plans.

<i>That is courteous,
but unnecessary.</i>

Mina's body and personal effects
have been moved off base.

For the moment,
I do not know.

But that will change.

<i>Mina's body
cannot be autopsied</i>

<i>or the nature of our gifts
will become known.</i>

<i>And this will bring
unwanted attention.</i>

<i>Is that clear?
Mmm.</i>

<i>Expect my call.</i>

Mina.

<i>You need some positive
male attention for</i> a <i>change.</i>

Look, Ludmilaâ€œ.

Let's get out of here.

No, no, no. Hold up.

One of the men that was wounded

It wasn't supposed

The one that got killed. They

That's all you got? Huh?
Mmm?

Yeah.

Why you got
a gold thong on?

Fucking bastard.

Let's get out of here.

We got to make

You got a GPS, man?

"Mid 20s, excellent
physical condition.

"Signs of pre-mortem
intercourse.

"Contusions,
head and neck.

"Multiple bullet wounds.
One fatal shot to the head."

What are you
doing, man?

What? Looking for
identifying marks'

No tan lines,
nice body.

Oh. Fully shaven.
Brazilian.

Vag piercings.

Not a stripper.

Why do you say that?

Well, because there's
too much hardware

that gets tn the way
of the software.

The piercings get caught
in a guy's teeth,

sounds like a door knocker.

He'd knock a nipple off.

Catastrophe, he can't
make it ram like that.

Pretty good hands,
nice hands.

No nail polish.

Hmm.

This tattoo though.

I've seen it before.

Where?

I don't remember.

Um...

Hit the lights.
Hit the lights!

Uh...

Hey, man, let me m.
Come on, man!

There's no room, man.

Get the fuck out of here.
Come on, man!

Damn n.

Whoa...

Goodness! Oh, okay.

Okay?-

Oh, Lord.

Oh, man.

Hey, what you waiting for?

Those girls definitely weren't strippers.
Yeah. I told you.

I had to lay next to a dead guy.
He was musty.

Bucket list, man.

Shit! Get down!
Watch it!

Hurry up!

Oh, I think I got hit.

Okay.

Jay?

Oh! Hey!

What happened?

Uh, just a little
complication in the case.

Complication?

Yeah. It's all good.

Do you need some
help with that?

Maybe.
Okay, great.

Sit. Just sit down.
Okay.

I'll be right back. Okay.
All right.

Breathe, breathe.

What are you doing?
Take your pants off.

I've seen you with less
clothes on than that before.

All right. Uh, okay.
Okay.

I remember when you used to give
me looks when we were kids.

I guess I was a little chubby
chaser back then, right?

No, I mean, but
you've changed, girl!

Tattoos and everything. I can do tats.
That's what I do now.

Well, I admire a man
who will risk his life

to save his family.

What can I say? That's what I do.
I risk for the family.

You really grew up.

So, that's it. Julian's
cousin's completely innocent'

Mmm, I knew n.

But if you're just gonna
whack the top brass,

why go somewhere
where you're guaranteed

to get caught
and killed yourself?

I think they were at the
base for something else.

We just don't know what it is yet.

My man.

So, what's the bad news?

What's the bad news?

You and Jackhole let some
motherfucker shoot up my goddamn car?

Oh, son of a bitch!

If it makes you feel any better,
Jules got a flesh wound.

Good, God damn it!

Where's your motherfucking
flesh wound?

If it wasn't
the Chinese,

who were they?

I don't know.

But they obviously had
the same intel we did.

Whoever" they were, you will
have to deal with them.

And your former
employer, Mr, Cordray.

I will inform the Wolf that
these plans are incomplete.

We will have to
find another way.

Boss.

<i>Boss,</i> wake up.
Boss.

What?
Camera three.

Go check it out.

Casey?

Casey?

Oh, fuck!

Bitch!

Two men who came by,
who were they?

Who were they?

Couple pie-ass Pls
from New York.

I didn't tell
them nothing.

I know what
you told them.

You fucking shot me.

I have something for the pain.

This is how
I'm going out?

Yes.

No bitches
on my hp?

Is that better?

Actually, yeah.

I want you to know

it's nothing personal.

I don't give a...

Sounds good.

Thank you, partner.

Hey, Big Ray,
let me ask you a question.

Hit me, Antoine.

Remember those, uh,
ribs that I made?

Yeah.

What was wrong
with them?

Well, there was nothing
wrong with them exactly.

In fact, I don't think I've ever
had a rib sauce so precise.

What they lacked was

passion, spontaneity.

See, there's three things
in life you got to riff,

Cooking, playing jazz,
and fucking.

So, what do I do'?

Man, you know how
to fuck, don't you?

Good-looking white boy like
you must get plenty of tail.

See, you got to...

You got to give
yourself over to it.

Just riff' brother.
Just riff.

I don't really do that

Yeah. Well, the levees
wasn't built in a day.

I can help you with
the cooking and the jazz,

but the fucking you got to
do on your own.

See, it's like this. It's about the...
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

About the...

When you get the good
food, you say...

Mmm.

Right? And when you get
the good jazz, you say...

Mmm!
Mmm!

And, boy' you get
that good pussy,

it's sure gonna
make you say.â€œ

Mmm!
Mmm!

Let's go back to the...

Come on.

That's what I'm talking about.
Then you got to sayâ€œ.

Mmm!

I feel dirty.
I feel dirty now.

Grab your nuts.
Grab your nuts.

Hold on to them nuts,
say... Mmm!

Mmm!

Mmm!
Mmm!

One more time, say...

Mmm!

<i>Baby, you go!
that good pussy</i>

<i>Oh, yeah, that's what
I'm talking about</i>

<i>Spread them pretty legs And let
me sink between them, yeah</i>

<i>Oh, baby!</i>

<i>Oh, baby!</i>

I think I'm ready.
I think I'm ready.

Let me hear that fucking.

Mmm!

Ow!
Ow!

And finally you sayâ€œ.

All right, all right.

You got it, baby.

Thank you.
I appreciate it.

Let me make you some breakfast, yeah?
All right.

What do you want?
What do you want?

Some pussy.

Welcome to
the Barataria Bayou Barn!

I'm Guy Mancini.

<i>And</i> this <i>is
Americana Chophouse!</i>

Today on the Chophouse,
we are going to feed you

the filet mignon
of the bayou.

The American alligator.

We are going
to cue 'em

and stew 'em and feed
'em to you good folks.

And this particular gator that
we're going to enjoy today

came right out of
the bayous behind us.

Before we go
any further though,

I would also like
to say thanks

to the man who provided us with
the space and the game today,

Mr. Beau LaMonde.

Looking very sharp
back there.

Wail.
Isn't he the one.â€œ

Cordray mentioned. Probably
tipped off the assassins.

Go try and
get close to him.

Well,
first things first

Got to have a nice,
sharp knife.

So, we're going to
start up here, high.

Can you hang on to it for me?
Yeah.

Keep this thing from
spinning right here.

It's like that saying.

"Bravest man I ever saw, the
first to eat an oyster raw."

I'd like to see the first guy who
wrestled one of these things

and go, "I'm hungry."

You got to go on in there, you
got to go through the rib cage.

But you don't want to
bypass the stomach either.

'Cause we found a 12-pound
catfish in one of them one time.

We smoked it up with some pecan shells.
It was delicious.

Okay, here we go.

Feel around in the stomach right there.
You see it?

See the stomach
right there?

Feel around, see if you can
find anything in there.

You feel anything?

I got something solid.

Well, it could be a turtle.
They eat those whole.

You can make
a soup out of that

No, I don't think
it's a turtle.

Let's see.
Can you get it out?

It's not a turtle.

Hmm.

Oh-ho!

ANTHONY; Fuck.

Whoa,
that's not a turtle.

Let's, uh,
put that in a pan.

Never found one
of those before.

That's... Getting a little
too curious about...

What is it?
Are you missing somebody?

Whoa, what's up,
Beau? What is that?

I'm cutting open a gator, I'm cooking this food.
What the hell is that?

That was definitely that
girl from the morgue's hand.

She had the tattoo.

She also had these
weird metallic implants.

Wasn't on the
coroner's report.

That ought to raise
a red flag at Homicide.

Or not.

JULIAN; What was that?

That's Louisiana
justice.

We got to get by
that water, man

There's going to be more
evidence around there.

The water? Like, where
the gators are? Yeah.

And they're doing gator shit,
like devouring human parts?

You know what we gotta do over there, right?
We're gonna look.

No, you going
to look over there.

Hell' no, I'm not going there.
We're both going over.

Come on. Let's go.
What?

Man' I hate gators.

<i>SECURITY' Sir,
I can't understand you.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Could you speak
English please?</i>

They probably dumped
the body over by the bridge.

Just keep
your eyes open, all right?

I got 'em open.
I'm looking.

I don't like the look
of this water.

Shit, look. It's right there.
See?

See what?

You want me to what?

Like kill 'em?

You understand that?

I'm going to send
the other two dudes.

We got two creepers on the
northwest side of Upper Kenter.

Take 'em out.

Them two dudes.

Look at 'em.

Little mini steps.

Creeping-

I can't get wet.

I can't believe you're
making me do this, man.

I thought our friendship
meant more.

You know the largest gator ever
found was 1809, Louisiana.

Really?
19 feet, 1,000 pounds.

Okay, that's not cool, man.
Wrong timing.

Give me your hand.

Oh, fuck!

Reach.
Pull, pull!

It was your idea, you know.

Dude, don't
let me fucking...

Grab it.
I got it. Fuck.

Dude, this is the same one that
we found in that girl's hand.

Pull me out, man.
Hey, is that a gator?

Pull me, man! Pull me!

Oh, Shit! Shit! Pull!

Go, go, go, man!
Come on!

Come on. Come on!
Come on, run!

Come on.

Come on.

You know how to drive one of these?
My cousin had one.

Come on, come on.
Lay low!

Push, man, push!
Come on!

Where should we go? I don't know!
Just keep going!

Hey, skeletal augmentation
with titanium alloy.

These are not ordinary
assassins, man.

Who's that?
Can you see?

Holy shit!
She's shooting.

Go this way!
Go down that canal.

Fuck, I don't Know
where this leads, man.

Push it faster!

Anthony' faster!

You missed us, bitch!
We're out of here!

Wait a minute.
She's gaining on us.

She's got the scope.
Come on!

You gotta go side to side. Side to side!
We gotta shake them!

We're not
losing her!

I think there's something up here.
Make a left.

Hold on, man!
Hold on!

Hold on! Hold on!

Can't this thing
go faster?

Big bump! Hold on!

Motherfucker! Yeah!
Whoo!

Fuck!

Bio-enhanced assassins.

That's some real
black ops shit.

Who are they? What did
they want at Fort Polk?

I've been thinking,
maybe it's some kind of

ultra high-tech
weapons system.

And I've been
thinking about that tattoo.

I know I've seen it
somewhere, like, on a woman.

I'm gonna need your
help remembering that.

Yeah.

Last year, my physics
adviser had a meeting

with some researchers
at Fort Pork'

and he came back and he...
Simone.

You mind if we talk
about this later?

Okay, sure.
I'm gonna be in my room.

All right. You ready
to get to work?

Yeah. Cue the music,
let's do it.

Baby, get it right there.

Oh.

Hey.

What is going on here?

Ah, how do
I say this?

Julian's got what he calls
a pornographic memory.

You mean
photographic memory?

ANTHONY; No.

Total sexual recall. He says he can
literally never forget a fuck.

I need quiet.

Right now he's going
through his memory banks.

For fun?

For the job.

Okay, okay.

You're saying he's going
into this memory of his

and recalling all the girls
he's ever slept with?

How long could
that possibly take?

Oh. Ooh.

You got 15 minutes.

Oh, do that right there.
Ooh, girl!

<i>Oh, yeah,
I remember that night.</i>

<i>She had so many tattoos.</i>

<i>She had, like,
Egyptian hieroglyphics.</i>

<i>"Savage Northâ€œ or "South,"
or something like that.</i>

<i>No. That's not it.</i>

<i>Jessica, I remember her.</i>

<i>Yeah. She kind of had
a little mustache, but...</i>

<i>No, that wasn't</i> a <i>tattoo.</i>

<i>- Ah, twerking Tina.</i>
Yeah.

<i>Yes. Twerking Tina.
Where's that tattoo?</i>

<i>No, she had
a butterï¬‚y. Oh!</i>

<i>My Asian persuasion.
The tramp stamp.</i>

And the sleeve.

<i>Oh, but she would
slap so hard.</i>

<i>No, damn it!</i>

Ooh.

<i>Flapjacks. Yes, I know
she had</i> a <i>tattoo.</i>

<i>Oh, it was a rose.</i>

<i>I'm looking for
that damn scorpion.</i>

<i>Oh, yes!</i>

<i>The two wild shippers.</i>

<i>They had
a lot of tattoos.</i>

<i>What were their tattoos'?
Oh, that's right.</i>

<i>What did she have, like a
magic dragon or something?</i>

<i>No, it wasn't</i> a <i>scorpion.</i>

<i>Oh, but she was
working her body.</i>

<i>Then we went to Pinkberry
after that.</i>

Ooh, Simone.

<i>JULIAN' Girl,
you slimmed up.</i>

<i>What was
you doing, Herbalife?</i>

<i>Oh, yeah. She had a fire dragon.
it was like a phoenix.</i>

No!

You are so bad.

<i>She didn't have</i> a <i>tattoo,
why is she in this sequence?</i>

Get me out of here!

Oh!

How long was I under?

Three hours.
Any luck?

No, wrong context

Simone, you said you,
uh, know a professor

who did some work
at Fort Polk?

Oh, yeah.
My physics advisor.

He wanted
to get physical.

I didn't do it.
I could've got an A.

They offered me a lot of money for a
few equations, and I turned them down.

So, uh, what they were making
was pretty expensive, huh?

It was revolutionary.

But by now I'm sure
it's being developed

by every
industrialized country

and every big corporation
with a robotics division.

I heard the Chinese
are particularly interested.

Enough to hire assassins
to infiltrate a US base?

That's about as much as
I'm comfortable saying.

Anyway, remind Simone she
owes me, uh, extra credit.

Okay.
Thanks for your time.

Appreciate n.
Mmm-hmm.

All right. Get that
extra credit, huh?

<i>Ms. Wollcrofl.</i>

Professor Gussain.

How can I help you?

<i>Thefts of ballistic software
in Mumbai seven months ago,</i>

Stockholm two months ago, now a
failed attempt at Fort Polk'

<i>Is there</i>
a <i>question here?</i>

<i>I want to know what
you people are up to.</i>

Ask yourself if that's something
you'd really like to Know.

<i>Because I can oblige you.</i>

<i>Others are beginning
10 find out.</i>

Do yourself a favor,
Professor,

leave others to
the professionals.

Good day.

It is gone.

Worried about
your safety?

That is good.
You should be.

The Wolf needs you.

To do what?

Extrapolate from
incomplete blueprints.

Fill in what
we are missing.

As of this morning, Fort
Polk will no longer house

the military's exo-project.

Security there is about as
tight as my wife's rear end.

I had a feeling
you'd ask me that

Turns out that girl's body
up and walked off after all.

Right after I told you
where she was.

Now you, son,
are not your daddy.

Frankly, I don't know
what you are.

I do Know your
ambitions go beyond his,

and it's got you mixed up with
folks he wouldn't approve of.

As chair of the Senate committee
on national security,

I know a hell of a lot.

Take my advice,

don't leave
the country.

Wouldn't want to have
to serve an indictment

to some spider
hole somewhere.

Go on,
we're done here.

Go on with you now. Go on.

Motherfucker.

Yes, this is Dragovic.

Keep working.

<i>What did you say?</i>

<i>What did you say'!?</i>

<i>What did you say'!?</i>

Yeah.

<i>New orders
from the Wolf.</i>

You are going to pay a
visit to Senator Barnes.

And thus time,
Tatiana,

do not fuck it up.

Who has jurisdiction over Fort Polk?
Non-military, I mean.

Senator James Barnes.

All right, we're
gonna hit Barnes' office

in Baton Rouge
in the morning'

Wait, Barnes is in
town this weekend.

Today's the annual
gala for Tulane alumni.

Gussain is supposed
to go.

Hmm.

Whoa! She got
those Helen Binghams.

Wow. You really
don't stop, do you?

What? Hang on, no. I know
where I saw that tattoo.

Oh, shit.
Bingham.

Pay attention. I have a
little business to attend to.

Catalina, take this.

Look after Mummy,
will you?

<i>Of course. The Order
of the Ghost Scorpion.</i>

Order of
the what now?

It was this
post-Cold War experiment,

<i>an attempt to fill the power
vacuum after the Wall came down'</i>

<i>An international consortium
of assassins.</i>

Here.

Do you need
a moment?

What did you
say your name was?

Bingham.
Helen Bingham.

<i>ANTHONY'. Bojan Dragovic
was a godfather and guru.</i>

An expert in
irregular warfare

and bio-enhancement
technologies.

The titanium bones.
That's right.

<i>He created a cadre
of super-assassins.</i>

<i>After the oligarchs bought
out Russian intelligence,</i>

<i>Dragovic brought the organization
into the private sector,</i>

<i>working with whoever
was willing to pay.</i>

<i>Most recently,</i> a <i>financier
known as the Wolf.</i>

How do you
know all this?

I just know where to look,
Tor, Deep Web' Wikipedia.

What? What is it?

Uh, it's Professor Gussain.

Mmm.
It's for you.

The Wolf plans to
kill Barnes today.

I got to get this number to Barnes'
security, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Gussain contacted us.

So what?

That means he's too scared
to contact anyone else.

Even the Senator's
security.

The Wolf's got
people everywhere.

If we're going to do something,
we've got to do it on our own.

Where's this gala at?

Still so much like the intern
I took on 20 years ago.

You couldn't take no for
an answer then either.

I suppose that's part of your
appeal to your investors.

I'm glad you made
it tonight' James.

After our last meetingâ€œ.
Oh, oh, oh.

Even old friends don't
always see eye-to-eye.

I hope you don't need my
affirmation anymore, Hannah.

No' but I'll always
need your vote, Senator.

Ah.

If you'll excuse me.
Of course.

This is Hannah Wollcrcft.

Yes, I'll take
the call.

Hey, what time
are we starting at?

Already started, man.

Oh, shit.

Play it cool. Play it cool.
Play it cool.

I need to see some IDs.

You
know, she got my ID.

Oh!
You got theâ€œ.

I keep 'em in here.
 Mmm-hmm.

Yeah, I left them at home. What?

Girl, check
the left titty.

Check the left titty.

You need ID just to get
into a wedding reception?

Oh, no, wedding reception
is right around this corner.

First floor,
the Bayou Room.

Great,
thank you.

Take care, guys. Let
me see your ID, man.

You really work here?
Bye!

And these spots normally
have rooms we can cut through, so...

Yeah, we'll go. We'll
find another way through.

JULIAN; All right.

Whoever would've guessed me
tossing Terrible Timmy out of the ring

would literally land
him in the lap of love?

Look at this couple,
aren't they great?

Hey, man, high five.
Look at this hot couple.

I mean, come on.

Enough of me
and the word games.

Let's hear some of
Tina and Tim's friends'

words of
encouragement and love.

You, sir, you. Red tie,
come here for a second.

You. Come here.

You sure you want me?

Just say something
about this great couple.

No, you.

Well, uh...

What can I say about the
bride and groom, right,

that hasn't already
been said, huh?

Well, I met...

Tim.
Tim?

Met Tim in a, uh..

A mini-bar
in Little Tokyo,

and we got into some small
talk' had some short ribs.

And what can I say
about the bride, right?

She's so effervescent.

Tina?

Tina?
Yeah.

Twerking Tina?

It is a small world.

You know what I mean.

Tina and I, uh,
met at a strip club...

Mall. Strip mall,
met at a strip mall.

And, um...

I always said,
with that kind of assâ€œ.

Assets. She has many assets
that work in her favor.

And I always thought that she
was destined for big things.

Obviously, we all know that big
things come in small packages.

Or smaller
packages, right?

Anyways, do you
still have that tattoo?

She has a great
tattoo of a cowgirl

holding a lasso.

So every time
she'd twerk,

the lasso would justâ€œ.

It would whip like that.
It would just do

a little whip like that

It was a pelvic thrust
that she would do.

Anyways, we all
have a style.

I have a style.
You all have a style.

Breaking Bad,
you have a style.

And if tiny Tim
can handle that,

then more power to you,
and if he can't...

Then, girl'
you need to call me.

All right, okay.

Ah!

This isn't a fair fight!

How many of y'all
want some?

Come on. Dump this shit.
Switch!

Okay, okay!

Hold up!
He got my ribs!

My balls.

Get off of him now!

TINA; Put him down!

Oh, you...

Let me get mine! Let
me get on my feet.

Y'all lucky I don't
call my cousins!

You know you're
the only one I love.

All right, come on.

What was that?

What? I got caught in
my pornographic memory mode.

Worlds collide, okay?

Hey' will you guys
knock it off?

We got a life to save.
We gotta find the Senator.

All assets are in place.
You are weapons free.

Excuse me.
Remember me?

<i>Mmm'?</i>

Oh, shit.

Relax.

Everything's
going to be fine.

Close your eyes.

Almost there.

<i>I have
eyes on him.</i>

The Order has lowered
its standards, huh?

No more world
powers for clients.

No more finger on
the pulse of history.

Now you're just
another corporate tool.

A cog in the wheel.

Shut up, Mr Hester.

Whoa.

Jay?

Jay?

Hello'? Jay? Wake up, baby.
Come on.

Wake up!

Do you like Chekhov'?

You don't mean chief navigator
of the Enterprise,

<i>so Cherry Orchard,
Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters...</i>

A little
college Russian.

Tatiana, kill him.

I want you to know

it's nothing personal.

I think it is.

Ah, for fuck's sake,
Tatiana.

Stand down,
I repeat, stand down.

Report back
for instructions.

How dare you
interrupt our work!

ls our deal off?

No. Our deal is no
longer necessary.

The Olsen twins
are waiting for you.

Right? Right?

<i>Shâ€œ.</i>

Listen, I'm going to
try to go get some help,

'cause he needs to
go to the hospital.

Keep that head up.
Hey, hey' hey!

<i>Mmm.</i>

Come here.
Come here.

The Wolf wants
to see both of you.

Now.

Dragno?

And here
I thought all this

daddy-issue, killer-cow
bullshit was just a sales ploy.

Only because I can
see you're hurting.

Tonight, our chief
Chinese competitor,

having developed
their own exo-project

in parallel with
the US military,

agreed to a merger.

We no longer need the US
government or their exo-armor.

We have our own.

It's so much more civilized
that way, don't you think?

Our Chinese counterpart made the
merger conditional in dissolving

all of our previous
entanglements.

Which unfortunately
means all of you.

Dispose of them.

If a black
market weapons dealer

fucked the madam of a
cripples-only orphanage

while Gordon Gekko
came on their faces,

the thing they'd make
would be you'

The Wolf.

You flatter me.

This time make sure the
bodies are never found.

Your handler got
what he deserves.

So will you.

My handler?

He was the only father
I've ever known.

I lost my family.

No one fucking cares.

And no more talking. We're
almost to the drop zone.

There's no reason
to go on.

Yeah?

There's always stripping, if
you need a reason to live.

Jules' you okay, man?
Yeah.

Non-lethal dose
of Propofol.

But he's going to wish
he didn't wake up.

You need a reason to go
on, now about vengeance?

We'll help you.

Hey, man.

So the bodies
don't float.

Hey, what's going
on back there' guys?

Hey, man, I don't
approve of all of that.

What was it, the stripping
or the vengeance?

All right,
I need a little help.

Need a little
help, guys!

Tony, get him out!

You know what
you're doing?

I learned
in the army.

Tank's been shot.
We're losing fuel fast.

We'll have just enough
to reach our destination.

What's that?

Vengeance.

We're going to
the Wolf's den.

The Wolf's Den?
Is that a strip club?

We have
severed all ties.

So it's a dean start.

<i>We're very happy</i>

<i>And now, Ms. Wollcroft,
3 present to you,</i>

proof of concept and a
token of our friendship.

They're not
slowing down.

Take care of it.
Yes, ma'am.

All right, what's the plan?
What's the plan?

You jump.
I'll crash land.

Crash? You ain't got
a better plan than that?

There's got to
be a better plan.

If things had
been differentâ€œ.

I know, it would've
been great.

Come on, man,
we got to go.

We're jumping, man.
Go, go. Jump.

I'm scared of heights.

O-M-G!

Whoo! Whoo!

Come on, man.
Go, go!

Go! Move! Move! Go!

I don't wanna die!

Go! Go! Go! Go!

Come on!
Come on!

Come on! Come on!
Come on, man!

Oh, God!

Fuck!

Get down, man!
Get down!

We got to move.

Stay down!
Stay the fuck down!

Oh, my God!

What happened?

What happened?
You see something?

ANTHONY; Shit.

They're dead.

Stop right there!

You're enhanced,
I'm enhanced.

So why don't we just fight this
out like civilized people?

<i>You have a lifetime of training
on me, I'll give you that.</i>

But I have the best combat
software money can buy.

<i>What is it
you always say?</i>

It's nothing personal.

This time
it is, bitch.

(SIRENS WAILING}

Hey!

Drop your weapons!

We're
private detectives!

Hands where we can see 'em!
We're on the same team!

Wait! Stop! They're the good guys.
They're with me.

Hey!
Oh, my God!

Come on, guys, sweep the house.
Come on in.

Sweep the house.

Go on and sweep
the house, bro.

There's some
bad guys in there.

It was crazy.
I had to slide.

I picked up a gun.
I started shooting backâ€œ.

Thank you for
your cooperation.

Thank you.
Are you okay?

<i>New W!'</i>

Just want you to know,
I blamed it all on you.

Good, 'cause
I blamed it on you' too.

<i>Dam!</i>

They found
Dr. Gussain this morning.

Yeah?
SIMON E; Alive.

<i>Mmm.</i>

Get him down! Get him down!
Watch it!

Let's get him
out of here.

Oh, and they arrested
Beau LaMonde.

Oh, see?
It's good.

Show me
your hands, now!

Guess there's
nothing left to do but

go get on a plane
back to New York, huh'?

No, we're not going nowhere, you still
got a competition to win. Let's go.

All right, Anthony.

Take care of yourself. You, too.

Take care. Hey.

You cleared Wilson's name and you
caught some really bad folks.

You done us proud.
Thanks, Big Ray.

Maybe I can visit more often.
Oh, hell no.

But listen, you are gonna kick out
for the bodywork on that Caddy,

Mr. Big Fancy Pl.

And you tell Antoine I
said, "Riff that shit up."

Big Ray, manâ€œ.

It's you, man.
You the man.

Nice sweater.

You know what,
fuck you.

And the action
is fast and furious here

as our chefs are preparing
their catfish courtbouillon.

It's gonna be some
seriously good food here.

It's already
smelling wonderful,

and we haven't even
lit the fire yet.

We'll be back here on
Bayou to Bourbon Street

right after this.

Can we get some
stage hands up here

and push this table
out of the way?

Sorry, coming through.
Excuse us.

Anthony, where you been?
You're a little late.

Is this our chef?
Hey, how y'all doing?

Hi, Anthony Hester.
Sorry about that.

Hi, Chef Tardy,
how are you'?

Who's this? Are Batman
and Robin gonna cook?

No, I'm just his manager.
Manager?

You could've managed to get
him here quicker, you think?

I love this guy, right?

You got this.

Shit, man, I
haven't had any prep time.

What? What are you
talking about?

Remember what Big Ray said, "Let
it flow, just let it flow."

Back in five, people.

All right, let it flow.
Flow on out of here.

Four, three, twoâ€œ.
Off the stage.

Calm down,
Chef Boyardee.

And we're back here on
Bayou 10 Bourbon Street,

and the action is
fast and furious.

I'm Guy Mancini, and you can
see our chefs are really

flying into ii.

Yeah, and what do
we see over here?

Jamie is Knocking outâ€œ. It looks
like Jamie is making a mirepoix.

Yeah, all of our chefs are really...
Jay, what's he doing?

...really
getting involved.

Oh, he's focusing his energy.
He'll be all right.

Tearing it up over here as they
prepare their catfish courtbouillon.

He looks paralyzed.

No, no, no. He knows
what he's doing.

<i>RAY". You got to give
yourself over to it.</i>

<i>Just riff, brother.
Just riff.</i>

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do that.

We've got a lot
of action going on.

Let's see what he
does with his fish,

'cause everybody else
is so far ahead of him.

Come on, Anthony.

Looking
good, Anthony.

I know
you can't really rush art,

but we are gonna rush our catfish
courtbouillons over here.

Oh, there it is.

Looking at him.
Scoring his fish.

Oh, Jesus,
it's a fire!

Anybody ever seen anything like this before?

Ladies and gentlemen,
you're looking at a winner.

Wow, it's smelling
really good, too.

You're the best!

Around.

And next up is Chef
Anthony Hester's new creation

of, uh, catfish amandine.

We'll start
with you, Carol.

I see some...

This dish is superb.

...real soul
in here.

I can taste the
passion in this dish.
