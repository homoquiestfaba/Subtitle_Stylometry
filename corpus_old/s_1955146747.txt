EVERY TEST WE'VE DONE,

DON'T BE A DICK, ERIC.

I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE A DICK.

I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T--
SARAH, COME ON.

YOU KNOW,
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

THAT SHE'S RELATED TO YOU.

WHY'S THAT?

WELL, FOR ONE THING,
SHE'S LOVING,

SHE'S KIND,
CONSIDERATE--

PRETTY MUCH ALL THE
THINGS THAT YOU'RE NOT.

WOW.

WELL, I GUESS EVERYBODY HAS
TO HAVE THEIR OPPOSITE, RIGHT?

THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
SHE CHOSE YOU.



[CHILDREN LAUGHING]

THERE IS SOME
GOOD GHOST FODDER

THERE WAS A SERIAL KILLER
BACK IN THE 70s.

WHO?

NEWSPAPERS CALLED HIM,
"CANNIBAL KANE."

SAID HE MUTILATED
HIS VICTIMS,

THEN ATE THEM.

SOME WEIRD SATANIC
SOMETHING-OR-OTHER.

THEY CAUGHT HIM, RIGHT?
OH, YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

CREEPY TO KNOW THAT THERE'S PEOPLE
LIKE THAT IN JAIL GETTING OLD LIKE US.

WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

WELL, HE GOT OUT?

NO, NO, NO, NO.

HE DIED.

THE PRISONS BURNED DOWN
BACK IN THE 80s.

IT WAS LIKE, THIS BIG STORY AROUND HERE.

SOMETHING LIKE 100 PEOPLE
WERE TRAPPED INSIDE,

DIED IN THEIR CELL.
WE NEED TO CHECK THAT OUT.

YEAH, WE DO.
WHAT?

YEAH, IT'S
A PERFECT NIGHT,

A FULL MOON.

OH, EXCUSE ME.

WAIT, YOU WANT TO TAKE US
TO A BURNT OUT PRISON

IN THE MIDDLE
OF NO WHERE,

YEAH.
AT NIGHT,

BECAUSE IT'S A FULL MOON?

SOMEHOW A FULL MOON
MAKES THAT A GOOD IDEA?

IF YOU WANNA GO NOW,
THERE'S STILL DAYLIGHT LEFT.

BUT, UM,
THE ONLY THING IS

THAT THE GHOSTS
DON'T COME OUT UNTIL NIGHT.

YOUR GHOST HUNTING MANUAL, RIGHT?

I-- I HAVE ALWAYS
WANTED TO SEE THAT PLACE.

I'M SORRY, WHAT?

IN HIGH SCHOOL,
ALL THE KIDS USED TO GO,

IT WAS LIKE A DARE.
KINDA LIKE,

CRAPPY SWEATER I LOVE?

WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

IT'S GONNA GET COLD.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

WHAT THE HELL WAS HE TALKING
ABOUT WITH THE BUTTERFLIES?

WELL, IT'S JUST ERIC.

I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, THEY
PROBABLY JUST NESTED IN THE HOUSE,

AND THEN GOT OUT,
GO INTO OUR ROOM SOMEHOW.

LOOK, HE TELLS
HIS BULLSHIT STORIES,

AROUND THE WORLD

PISSING AWAY OUR MONEY,
AND I'M OVER IT.

NOW, THIS SHIT?
GHOSTS? BUTTERFLIES?

REALLY?

OH, YOU NEVER SHARED
THAT WITH ME.

I WANT YOU BROTHER
OUT OF HERE.

CAN YOU KEEP YOUR
VOICE DOWN, PLEASE?

I'M SORRY ABOUT THE CHECK.
I SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

YEAH, WELL, IT'S--
IT'S BIGGER THAN THE CHECK.

IT'S EVERYTHING.

NOT RESPONDING
TO YOUR E-MAILS,

BLOWING OFF
YOUR PHONE CALLS,

AND NOW THE RANDOM SHOWING
UP TO CRASH WHENEVER HE WANTS?

TELLING MORE
BULLSHIT STORIES

THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY
BOTHERING YOU.

WELL, HOW IS THIS HELPING?

I WANNA SEE
WHAT HE SEES,

AND CALL BULLSHIT ON IT.

FINALLY CHIP AWAY AND THIS-- THIS
MYTH HE'S BUILT HIS ENTIRE LIFE AROUND.

HE'S NOT
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

YEAH, WELL,
YOU ARE.

AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE MOTHER OF OUR CHILD.

EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE BORN
TWO MINUTES BEFORE HE WAS,

YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING
BIG SISTER FOR WAY TOO LONG.

HE'S GOT TO GROW UP.

IT STARTS TODAY.

THAT SWEATER?

THANKS.

COME BACK IN AN HOUR?

YOU KNOW, SOMEDAY YOU'RE GONNA
REALIZE THAT THIS ISN'T A MISTAKE.

WHAT ISN'T A MISTAKE?

WHO WE ARE.

THE THINGS WE SEEN.

THE THINGS THAT
WE'VE BEEN SHOWN.

SARAH, YOU AND I
HAVE A GIFT.

OH, I DO HAVE A GIFT.

AND YOU'VE MANAGED
TO CONVINCE HIM

TO TAKE THIS STUPID HIKE.

AND IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO HIM,

I WILL KILL YOU

WITH MY BARE HANDS.

WHOA.

THIS IS IT.

THIS IS WHERE
THOSE PRISONERS DIED.

THIS IS FUCKING IT.

WITH US, KANE?

KANE, ARE YOU HERE?

WAIT.

WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

I'VE READ ABOUT THESE PEOPLE
UP IN THE MOUNTAINS.

THEY DEVELOPED THEIR OWN
KIND OF RELIGION.

SOME SORT OF DEMONOLOGY

BASED ON VOODOO
AND CHRISTIANITY

AND ORAL TRADITIONS
ALL COMBINED.

"SIRRAHANA."

MAYBE SIRRAHANA'S
THEIR SAVIOR.

MORE LIKE THEIR DEVIL.
BABY, LOOK AT THIS.

"THE LOST RETURN--

AWAKENING OF THE DEAD

AND THE END BEGINS.

DRAWING THE DEVIL

FROM OUT OF THE CYCLE."

HELLO?


JESUS. I DON'T LIKE THIS, ERIC.
CALM DOWN.

THIS ISN'T LIKE ANYTHING
WE'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.

PLEASE CAN WE JUST GO? - IT'S
JUST OUR FRIENDS TRYING TO PLAY--

I DON'T FUCKING CARE, THIS PLACE
GIVES ME THE CREEPS, ALL RIGHT?

TAKE SOME PHOTOS TO PROVE
WE WERE HERE, AND LET'S GO.

OKAY. OKAY.

I LOVE YOU.

I LOVE YOU TOO.

[SKYE MOANING]

[ROARING]
[SCREAMING]



OH, MY GOD.

SARAH SHOULD BE WAITING
FOR US.

I STILL THINK IT'S SAFER
IN HERE THAN OUT THERE.

WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU MEAN?

DID YOU NOT SEE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

MATT, I LIVED IT.

THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

IS THAT I DON'T WANT
TO RUN FROM IT.

THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU'RE
FUCKING INSANE. OKAY?

THE SIDE EFFECT IS
YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN.

STOP FIGHTING.

AM I ALL ALONE HERE? DOES ANYONE
ELSE SEE HOW FUCKING INSANE THIS IS?

I'M READY TO GO HOME.

THERE'S SOMETHING
DOWN THERE, GUYS.

IT WANTS TO BE HEARD.

IT WANTS US TO HEAR IT.
DON'T YOU GET THAT?

YOU WANNA STICK AROUND WITH A COUPLE
OF FLASHLIGHTS, FIND OUT WHAT IT IS?

ERIC, PLEASE.
OKAY, YEAH.

WE'RE GOING.
I'M NOT GOING.

BABY, WHATEVER'S
DOWN THERE,

IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

HEY.
FINE, FINE.

WE'RE COMING BACK.
OKAY?


THANK YOU SO MUCH.

I NEED TO GET TO
A HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY.

I DID NOT THINK
THAT ANYBODY WAS GONNA STOP.

YOU WAS SAYING?

YEAH, UM...

I WAS JUST SAYING
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

NICE NIGHT FOR A WALK.

[NERVOUS SIGH]
YEAH.

ALL RIGHT?

WILL YOU JUST PLEASE-- - EVERYBODY
PLEASE, JUST CHILL OUT, OKAY?

WHAT'S GOING ON?

SOMETHING IN THAT BOOK.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT BOOK?

WHAT? DO YOU GUYS KNOW
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T?

WHAT BOOK?

HERE, TAKE IT.

[PAGES RUSTLING]

"TO WRITE TO THE OFFERED--

ON SEDUCING THE SOUL
OF THE NEWBORN

A VESSEL WILL DELIVER
THE CHOSEN."

OKAY, WE, UH-- WE HAVE TO
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

HOW?

THERE-- THERE HAS
TO BE ANOTHER PATH.

WE HAVE TO TRY AGAIN.

OF EVIL IS IN THIS PLACE?

WHAT IS HAPPENING?

IS THIS REAL?
IS THIS REAL--

FIND A WAY OUT OF HERE.

ERIC,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

ERIC!

THIS IS WHERE
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

RIGHT HERE. THIS IS THE
STRONGEST SIGNAL I'VE EVER GOTTEN.

NOW, WE WERE BROUGHT
HERE FOR A REASON.

NOW, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GUYS,

BUT I'M GONNA GO FIND OUT
WHAT THAT REASON IS.

IF YOU GO DOWN THERE,
I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOU.



MY BROTHER SAID

THAT A PRETTY
YOUNG WOMAN'S EXPECTING

JUST TO SETTLE
IN THESE PARTS.

UM, MY HUSBAND
AND OUR FRIENDS

WENT OVER TO LOOK
FOR THAT PRISON.

THAT BURNED DOWN?

YEAH.

ANYWAY, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GO GET THEM,

SO, CAN WE PICK THEM
UP ON THE WAY?

THERE'S ONE GOOD THING
THAT CAME OUT OF THAT FIRE

AT LEAST.

IT KILLED THAT DEVIL
PREACHER KANE.

KILLED HIM GOOD.

WE HEARD ABOUT HIM.

MOST HAVE.

MOVE IN THESE PARTS HAD--
HAD SOMEONE THEY LOVE

PULLED OFF
INTO THE NEXT WORLD

BY HIS BUSH AXE.

THAT MAN HAD
NO GOOD IN HIM.

PURE EVIL, HE WAS.

HOW DID THEY CATCH HIM?

IT WEREN'T NO "THEY."

CAPTAIN GOT HIM.
THE CAPTAIN?

WELL, HE AIN'T BEEN
THERE FOR A WHILE,

BUT WE STILL CALL HIM.

THEY LET ME RIDE ALONG
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE.

FEELS LIKE HOME

IN THE SQUAD CAR.

[SIGHS]
HE BROUGHT A LOT OF THESE PARTS.

HE'S THE ONE WHO KEPT
THIS PLACE FROM FALLING

TO THE SODOMITES.

WHAT IS THAT?

PEOPLE UP HERE
BELIEVE DIFFERENT.

TRADITION'S ALL JUST
PASSED DOWN GENERATIONS.

THESE AREN'T THE SAME ROADS

THAT WE TOOK
TO GET UP HERE.

MORE THAN ONE ROAD
IN THE HILLS.



WHAT YOU CALLING AT?

AH!

IS YOUR BODY
SPEAKING AT YOU?

YEAH,
I NEED YOU TO PULL OVER.

WE'RE GONNA BE OUT
IN A FEW MINUTES.

NO, I'M GONNA BE SICK.

I NEED YOU TO PULL OVER NOW.

PLEASE?

HEY, COME BACK!

IT AIN'T SAFE!

OKAY, WE HAVE TO FIND
ANOTHER WAY OUT OF HERE.

HOW?
IT'S PITCH BLACK OUT THERE.

YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA?
YEAH, WE CALL FOR HELP.

NO ONE CAN GET ANY RECEPTION.
WE CAN, WE JUST HAVE TO--

WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP TRYING.

YOU KNOW, CAUSE SARAH'S--
SARAH'S OUT THERE,

SHE'S WAITING FOR US.

DON'T TOUCH ME!
HEY, CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.

HOW LONG HAVE

SINCE I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD.

SARAH?

HEY, WE'RE LOST.
CAN YOU HELP US?

OH, SHIT.

WHAT'S UP, WHAT'S UP?
THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE.

WHAT?

WHO ARE THEY?

WE DON'T WANT

WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

OKAY, THINK. THINK,

AND WE WAIT THEM OUT.

ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE?
AM I FUCKING INSANE?

WHAT, DO YOU WANNA
HANG AROUND AND SAY HI?

IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY?

MAY-- MAYBE
WE COULD SIDESTEP THEM.

WHAT IF WE CAN'T
LEAVE THIS PLACE?

WHAT IF EVERY PATH
LEADS US BACK HERE?

WE ARE GONNA

THEY'RE COMING.
LET THEM BRING IT THE FUCK ON.

LET'S GO, LET'S GO,
LET'S GO, COME ON.

HEY, COME ON,

[YELLING IN DISTANCE] HEY!

LOOK, WE'RE GONNA GET OUT
OF THIS HELLHOLE

ONE WAY,
OR ANOTHER,

BUT I AM NOT
