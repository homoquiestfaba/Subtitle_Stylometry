What's up, man?

What, man?

He said, "What's up?"

Oh.

Oh, sure you wanna do this?

Bitch!

Fuck, y'all!

Rasta-rah!

I'm a business man!

Let me see the readies.

A taste first.

You feelin' good, baby?

Ah, you rascal.

What the fuck, man?

It's just business.

Fuck!

Now crawl to the bathroom.

I don't want to clean up
no mess.

( BANG ON DOOR )

<i> ( MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

<i> ( MUSIC ENDS )</i>

Shit!

Leo, Leo.

I have been watching you,
my friend.

Shit, Guido,
what are you doing here?

The boss is really pissed
with you, my friend.

Come on, man,
I<i> was</i> collecting.

You know the rules!

No drugs--

I know, I know,
no drugs or whores.

What do I see? Heroin!
And that jacked up hooker!

Come on, man.

Me promise,
I not fuck the boss.

( YELLING )

<i> ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

I fuck you!

( GLASS SMASHING )

Hold on... hold on.

Hold on.
Come on, pour it on me.

Now give me a break.
Give me a break, okay?

Guido, please?

Give you break?
Yeah.

I'll give you two breaks.

( BONE CRUNCHING )

( BONE CRUNCHING )

Fuck!

No, don't take my money.

Don't take my money, man.

<i> ( FUNK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

<i> ( PHONE RINGING )</i>

<i> MAN ON PHONE:</i>
<i> Yeah?</i>

Boss, it's taken care of.

<i> BOSS:</i>
<i> Bless you, Guido.</i>
<i> Where are you?</i>

Ten minutes.

<i> Hurry up, here, there's</i>
<i> someone I want you to meet.</i>

Yes, boss.

( MUSIC FADES DOWN )

Thanks, amigo, I'm starving.
What do I owe you?

Where's the boss, inside?

Yeah, he's got Sid Shine
in there.
Sid Shine?

Yeah, and some
scary-looking guys.

What do they want?

Sid's introducing them to Jerry.

They're from Los Angeles
and moving a bunch of stuff
in here from Albania.

Big stuff...
I mean, currency and gold.

They need a big fucking shipping
container to do it.

So I sorted my friends out
at the Port for you, then what?

Well, that's it,
that's all you gotta do.

You just set us up and
you receive a royalty payment.

We return to Los Angeles.
Uran will stay here.

Your driver will take him to
Customs to collect our packages.

He's got all the details
of operations right
on his phone.

The first container
is already at the door.

But you must remember this,
it's against the rules...

to ship whores, drugs--

( ALL LAUGHING )

What's so fucking hilarious?

Look, why don't you just have
a car pick us up in the morning.

That won't be necessary, sir.

You've done enough.
Uran will take care of it.

JERRY (O.S.):
Oh!

Oh, gentlemen, let me introduce
you to Guido Amed...

my best, very best man.

I don't need no fucking driver.

I want you to take this man
to the dock yard tomorrow
morning and show him...

whatever he wants to see...

and whatever he wants you
to do, do it. Okay?

<i> ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

( ALARM CLOCK BUZZING )

<i> ( MUSIC CHANGES )</i>

Hey! Piss... your pants!

Now, fuck off.

Scaring my customers
away again, eh?

For the rent.

Still no checking account,
huh?

Goodbye.

Oh, aren't you
forgetting something?

No, come on, please!

Oh, stop arguing.

Every morning, the same shit.
It goes with the rent.

Okay, thank you very much.
Okay, goodbye.

SID: The Albanian has got all
the details of those shipments
on his phone.

I don't care if you have
to kill him and his driver.

Just do what you need to do,
I need that memory card
from Uran's phone.

Okay.

Understand?

I'll take care of the rest.

I think now is a really good
time to get out of the car.

Yeah, yeah... yeah.

Hello, faggot.

Tell me, what's the difference
between an American inflatable
sex doll and a Arab one?

The Arab one,
she blows herself up.

Do you get it, faggot?

This your guy?

Pleasure to meet you.

Got the money?

Pier 18, loading dock.

Oh, my god, what the
fuck is this shit!

Fuck your mother,
you mother son of a bitch!

Hey! Come back here! Where the
hell you think you going?

You mother fucker!
Stop the fucking car!
Stop the fucking car!

Fuck, stop, Stop it!
Jesus, hey asshole,
you know what you just did?

Hey faggot, come on.

Fucking son of a bitch!

Asshole, you know who I am?

What did my boss say, huh?

What did he say?

No hookers, no drugs,
mother fucker!

Come here! Come on.

( URAN YELLING )

I killed them,
they jumped us at the Port.

They wanted to get
the fat man's computer.

What are you doing,
you fucking idiot?

Guido, do you know what these
characters are like?
Do you know who they are?

Boss, I'm sorry.

How many did you kill?

All of them.

All of them?

At most, I think,
I'm sure, yes, all of them.

What about the Bekteshi boy,
did you whack him, too?

No, no, he's alive.

Where is he?

In the trunk.

Are you kidding?

No, no, he's there.

Well, open it.

No, no, boss,
it's not a good idea.

Just fucking open it!

You fucking did kill him.

Boss, I swear he was just fine
when I put him in there.

Hey, hey!

( NECK CRUNCHES )

Oh, my neck!

Boss!

I'm okay, I'm fine.

Hey, is that the guy
from last night?

Shut up. I'm gonna call
the Albanians.

What?

You're like a boomerang!
Keep coming back to bad news.

( PHONE RINGING )

O'Connell, what the fuck?
My vault was impounded.

My guy told me
they got ambushed.

I don't give a fuck
what he said!

Listen, you had whores
on the boat.

That is against the rules.
You can't have whores
on the boat.

What happened to my men?

Killed.

O'Connell, I'm going to rip out
your eyes and skull fuck you!

Hey, I told you they got
attacked. They were ambushed.

What the fuck's wrong
with you?

<i> Where is his phone?</i>

Hang on.

Guido!

The Albanians want to know
what happened to Uran's
fucking phone.

Oh, eh, in the shoot out,
he broke the phone.

He pulled out the chip
inside and swallowed it.

Oh, god.

It got broke,
he swallowed the chip.

<i> Are you absolutely sure</i>
<i> he swallowed it?</i>

Yeah, why would I make that up?

<i> Good, now bring us the body.</i>

You gotta get this fat fuck
to Los Angeles.

Los Angeles.
Yes, sir.

Three days minimum.

Yeah, he's gonna start just
stinking in like three hours.

Why are you talking?

What the Albanians want,
the Albanians get.

You remember that I am the one
responsible for moving your
immigration papers...

to the United States,
so you could live here,
you ungrateful bastard.

Boss, it's five state lines,
New Jersey plates.

I'm not gonna do this.

You killed him,
it's your responsibility.

Figure it out.

Hey, I don't trust that
Irish fuck.

He says he's got his driver
bringing the body straight
to us.

The towel head?
How is that a good plan?

Fuck that! We send someone,
they kill the Arab, and they'll
bring us Uran back.

( DISTANT WEEPING )

Piss your pants!
Oy!

Oh, excuse me, madam.

Guido...

Dios mio... are you robbing me?

No, no, no, no,
I am taking a trip.

I have to leave now,
I'm going to Los Angeles.

You're going to Los Angeles.

Take me with you!
No!

I have to go.
I have to go home.

Heh?
Mexico home.

It's just five hours south
of Los Angeles.

Don't be ridiculous. No!

You don't understand,
Guido!

Mrs. Gomez...

So, I guess I had better
go with you, huh?

What did you see?

Enough to know that you've been
a very naughty little boy.

You're too nosy for your own
good, you know?

You don't scare me.
No?

So, either you drive me across
the country, or I take myself
to the police department.

Your choice.

Shit! Sh--

Is there a problem?

No, no problem.

<i> ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Hey, Sid,
what are you doing here?

Well, you know...

One, no, one.

You gonna tell me
who's in the trunk?

No.

Or how he died?

No!

I know what you do.

How do you know?

I have eyes,
it's a small neighborhood.

I know the company you keep
and the hours you keep.

Who's the little girl?
The little girl in the picture
next to the bed?

What do you doing in my room?

I have a right to know
who lives in my building.

You stay out of my room.

Hmm... how old is she?
Ten?

She is my sister.

Just trying to figure out
what happened.

( POWER DRILL WHIRRING )

Okay, we're just trying
to smooth things out.

So...

Why don't you tell me
what happened...

after Uran swallowed the chip?

I already told you.

( FLESH TEARING )

Guido killed him.

Nice.

What are you doing?

Huh?

What is it with you?
What?

Everywhere you go, what?
You always gotta fuck around.

No, I'm serious, this is
worrisome. It's like you
got ADD or something.

Like it's--
Don't fucking--

Just hurt me.

Took the limo
to go back to the Albanians.

He's in the limo?

Now come on, you wouldn't be
lying to me about that,
would you?

No, goddamn it!

Why would I lie?

So how do we find this limo?

I don't know.
You don't know?

Sid!
How can you not know?

Sid!
What?

What is this?

It looks like a tracking poster.

Oh, so you can track your limos?

Was that--

Why didn't you say so?

I have a sister, too.

I haven't seen her in years.
Decades.

Where does your sister live?

I have to concentrate
on my driving.

Where are you from, Guido?

( POLICE SIREN WAILING )

Can I get the info on Tom,
Edward, John, Sam, 932?

Why don't you give me your
license and registration.

What kind of name is Guido Amed?
Is that Arabic?

Iraq.

Why don't you go ahead
and pop your trunk.

Will this take long, officer?

I need to use
the little girl's room.

Number two, you know?

No, ma'am.

You know what? Why don't
you just get out of here.

Why do they call you Guido?
You're not Italian?

When I came to this country,
everybody would say to me...

"Hey, are you a fucking Guido?"

So, when it came time
to fix my papers...

I said, "My name is Guido".

I'm gonna get some ice, okay?

I'm gonna check us in.
Okay.

Hey...
Go!

Aren't you the little guy
from the Harrison party?

Go!

Give me that!
Give me that!

I think we might have problem.
Huh?

Our guy's not picking up.
I don't know what's wrong.

Maybe he's shy.

Um, I don't think so.

Just get someone else on it,
would you?

Someone who knows how
to use a fucking phone!

( SPEAKING ALBANIAN )

Let's go.
He wants 40 bucks.

Guido, Saint Thomas Catholic
Church is right on our way.

No, no.

We can't afford to miss a
historical sight like this.

No way.

Guido, I'm not going to travel
all the way across country...

to miss St. Thomas Catholic
Church. It is the oldest
Catholic Church in Missouri.

The answer is no, all right?

Guido, we must seize the
opportunities that life gives
us...

or they slip away and before you
know it, your time will be done.

I'll wait for you in the car.

40 bucks
for the lady's room!

We are not stopping
at some church.

I am working, you are coming
along for the ride.

Do not ask again, all right?

I'm dying.

It's a one-way trip.

You get five minutes.

Guido, Guido?
What?

Thank you.

Fuck you.

<i> ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

God, Guido, you stupid fuck.

Come on,
what's taking so long?

That's what you get for working
the food chain, folks.

He gonna make it?
Looks like it.

I want a call. Hey, anyone not
working here now, I want out.

You hear me, out!
Just do it!

( PHONE RINGS )

Quiet! I said, quiet!

Hello?

Who is this?

Who are you looking for, sir?
Detective Rivers!

<i> FULLER ON PHONE:</i>
<i> Found the weapon.</i>

<i> RIVERS ON PHONE:</i>
<i> Hello?</i>

Shit!

Shit! Shit! Shit!

Hello?

All right,
put a trace on that.

Run my photos through Interpol.

Hey, you ever tried Xanex?
Lorazepam? See a doctor,
will ya?

It's beautiful, built in 1830.
Hmm...

You go, I'll stay in the car.

Don't be ridiculous.
We've come all this way,
you're going inside.

Do you want to know why this
church is so special to me?
I got married here.

We stopped here driving across
country. It was 50 years ago.

Isn't it peaceful here?

Peace makes me uncomfortable.

Guido, the universe has a great
capacity for forgiveness.

He created man's weakness...

'cause he knows that we should
know that to err is human...

and nobody is perfect.
Mohammad said that.

How do you know the Quran?

Look, lady, you do not know
what I have done in my life.

If there is heaven...

I am going to hell.

When you come to my village,
maybe you will change your mind.

Now, excuse me,
I'm gonna make a confession.

Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

When did you last take
confession?

15 years ago
when my husband died.

Do you believe in forgiveness?
Of course.

Jesus is--
No, I mean real forgiveness.

For something like murder?

Murder?

Jesus Christ!

Can a man take another man's
life and still find forgiveness?

Can he ever forgive himself?

<i> ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

I have a friend.

He's in trouble, Father.

He's put up such a wall
of defense, you know?

I'm not sure if he can ever find
his way back out again.

Your friend, the killer?

He's hurting inside,
I know it.

But if he can't see that,
how can I help him?

All a man needs to find
forgiveness is to truly open up
to the Lord and ask for it.

You, you can't force it.

Thank you, Father.

I feel much better now,
and you?

Fantastic.

I told you, I told you,
you would feel better
if you came in.

Shall we go?

Okay, we go.

<i> ( FUNK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Why isn't that green dot
moving?

Yeah.

Hey, uh, sorry, boss.
You want me to come back later?

No, I want you to tell me why
you are knocking on my door?

I got a-- a bit of bad news.

Would it have anything to do
with why my little green dot
is ditting on its ass?

'Cause he got killed.

But you said it was the best
fucking contact that you had,
didn't you?

We underestimated the Arab.

Okay, so what now? I'm gonna
have to cut in on that
fat fuck myself? Right?

It's what you're telling me
here? Get the car.

Well, he's probably halfway--

Look, we're talking here and you
should be getting the car!
Get the car!

Are we done here?
I'll tell you
when we're fucking done!

<i> ( MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

<i> ( MUSIC ENDS )</i>

(<i> DISCO MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Hello, darling.

Go away, you stink.

Yep, just as I thought,
made in heaven.

Dios mio. Get lost.

Oh, feisty!

I got me a nice, little room up
on the second floor.

Maybe you'd like to come up
there, get to know each
other and--

( LOUD CRASH )

Was that necessary?

Was what necessary, Madame?

Never mind, Guido.
Call me Maria.

Okay, Maria.

I am sorry.

For what?

I am sorry you're going to die.

We are all dying, Guido.

That's what makes moments
like this so precious.

<i> ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Oh, I love this song.

Dance with me.
No, no, no, I don't know how.

You're joking.

When I grew up,
it was not allowed.

Everybody knows how to dance.

No, no, no, please.

All you have to do
is give in to it.

In my village, I remember
all we did was sing and dance.

But what are we going
to do now?

Follow me, Guido.

Please, come on.

Let it happen.
Let what happen?

Just enjoy.
Enjoy the music.

<i> You'll want someone too</i>

<i> Are crashing like an ocean</i>

<i> Don't you ever get caught up</i>
<i> In emotion</i>

<i> Hold on belong</i>
<i> Come on to you</i>

Are you awake?

I don't sleep so good at night.

When my husband became ill,
he couldn't sleep either.

So I used to tell him stories.
Put him right out.

And now it's my turn
and he's not here.

I could tell you stories.

Once upon a time--

Once upon a time,
there was a little girl.

And she had a little dog.

What kind of a dog?

I don't know.
The kind that's all mixed up.

A mutt.

Mutt.

So the little girl and the mutt
were playing in the streets
one day.

That's when the airplanes came.

And they dropped the canisters.

All the little canisters....

plunk, plunk, pss.

And smoke...

And the mother and the father
of the little girl they run out
and other peoples...

they run out and the gas just
put them all to sleep.

Psssss.

And the little boy
in the house...

he sees his family lying in the
street and he begins to cry.

And he cries and he cries
for so long.

And then one day,
the little boy he says...

that he will never feel that
pain again. Ever.

I understand.

Good night, Guido.

( AIRPLANES PASSING OVER )

Oh, you're having a dream.

( GUIDO CRYING )

Rivers!

What you got?

We traced that call.

It's a company phone, belongs
to O'Connell's limo services.

Now I checked the logs that we
impounded last night and
apparently...

it's permanently out
to a Guido Amed.

The same file has him driving
an '84 Cadillac limousine
with bogus plates.

But it is O'Connell,
what do you expect?

Going somewhere with this?

Remember the killings that went
down on the Jersey docks a few
days ago?

Yeah, the Albanian charter?
Smuggling those girls... so?

Closed circuit TV at the docks
matches a plate...

going through security at the
time of the shootings.

What do you mean, they match
O'Connell's plates? Are you
fucking shitting me?

I shit you not.

What do you know?

That's good work.
Good work!

See what you can dig up
on this Guido Amed.

I'm on it.

Also, I put out the All Points
Request on revenge killings.

I should be getting a response
back in the next-- few hours.

( FAUCET RUNNING )

<i> ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

What happened here?

Did you sleep well?

Yeah, I did.

Me, too.

Do you know...

I--
What?

Never mind.

Guido, only small children
say that.

Let me tell you something.
No, never mind.

It's just...

I am glad you are with me,
Maria... on this trip.

Me, too.

Come on, we gotta go.

Okay, so he goes by Guido Amed.

He's an Iraqi national
over here on a work visa.

Wait a minute,
how do you figure that?

This is interesting.

His birth name
is Toofich Bin Amed...

he was the chief bodyguard
for the Barzani warlords...

in Kurdistan
during the second Gulf War.

I mean, this guy was
feared throughout the region.

He was involved in all sorts
of trouble from gun running
to smuggling, you name it.

I mean, the people back there
still call him by his tribal
moniker, "The Fierce One".

What is this guy he's
working over?

Don't know,
still working on that one.

Now, after the North
was liberated...

Bin Amed got a job working
for a contractor as a driver
and guide.

The Government, ours, promised
him a work permit here in the
U.S...

if he was able to find
a bona fide job offer.

And there was O'Connell?
Exactly.

With the phone call
you traced, right?

Yeah.
Over the phone.

From the cell phone outside
of Saint Louis, Missouri.

Missouri?

Well, he's driving
cross-country, isn't he?

I gotta see what's in the limo,
do you understand?

What's in the trunk?

You gotta cover the airports,
the borders, the ferry routes...

plaster his face, man,
everywhere!

About an hour, Jimmy.

No!

( SPEAKING ALBANIAN )

Malakas called, bad news.

Oh, fuck!

Get off the girl and put your
fucking pants on!

The cops are gonna get
to him before we do.

Got it coming.
Got my best guy on it.

Thought the last guy
was your best guy?

Let me tell you something.

If by some miracle,
this desert bunny makes
it to us in one piece...

we got to make a nice
reception for him.

What kind of reception?

Cheese and fucking crackers.

Jesus Christ, what the fuck
the reception do you think
I mean?

Go, you make sure they don't
find them before we do!

Skol.

Da.

Fucking pig.

<i> ( FUNK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Are you sure
you like this color?

It's okay,
what's the problem?

Mm, nothing.

You know why I want to go back
to my village, Guido?

No.

So much beauty and tranquility.

And I always thought I wanted
to go back to die there.
So why did you leave?

I fell in love
with a Lebanese merchant.

Lebanese? Arab?

( SPEAKING ARABIC )

You have a weakness
for Arab men.

Needless to say, it didn't go
over very well with my father.

I was young, I was in love
and nothing else mattered.

So, I ran away.

You ever go back?

( SPEAKING SPANISH )

I was the black sheep
of the family...

the one no one talks about.

Funny that we are both exiles
of our own country.

Where are you from, Guido?

What? Do I have to beat it out
of you? Ah, Dios mio.

Tough guy, who are you?
What do you do, Guido?

I'm from Iraq,
my parents were Kurds.

I grew up in the city
of Al-Awja.

When Saddam's soldiers came,
they killed thousands
of peoples from my city.

My family... all gone.

What do I do?

I kill people.
I am good at killing.

That must be very hard.

Not really, the skin is thin,
the bones break easily.
No problem.

That's not what I mean.

Are you okay?

It's just the fumes.

Thank you, Guido.

For letting me into your life
a little bit.

For bringing me on this journey.

You have my husband's eyes.

What is this guy sight-seeing
with a corpse in the trunk?

<i> ( MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

There is something seriously
wrong with this guy.

Well, he'll be dead soon,
he might as well live a little.

We'd better piss faster,
would you?

How fucking fast
do you want me to piss?

We are like five hours away
from him and longer if he keeps
fucking around, so hurry up.

You must be tired,
or need a hug or something.

I'm gonna lie down
in the back.

Okay.

( PHONE RINGING )

It's me.
<i> Guido.</i>

Everybody and their mother's
looking for you.<i> Jerry's dead.</i>

Sid and his goon worked him
over, wanting to know
where Uran was.

He sanded his hands down until
he talked and then he grinded
off<i> his fucking face.</i>

The cops have been all over me.

<i> What did you tell them?</i>
Nothing!

They know all about you, they
been looking everywhere for you.

Oh, so is half of
Al-frickin-bania, by the way.

<i> That's one hot stiff</i>
<i> you got.</i>

Listen, when I called
Jerry's office...

<i> Agent Rivers,</i>
<i> he answered the phone.</i>

He's a tight-ass.

<i> Is he straight?</i>

How the fuck should I know
if he likes boys or girls?
What the fuck?

Shut up, listen,
is he a good cop?

<i> Oh...</i>

he's an old detective.

He seemed, I guess--
<i> Why?</i>

I want you to tell him
about the GPS tracking device
that's<i> under the car.</i>

Are you fucking crazy?
He'll--

<i> You have to tell him.</i>

It's very important.

Yeah, but--
<i> Stan...</i>

don't fuck this up.

<i> I'll call you soon.</i>

We got him!
We got what?

The mechanic was right.

The Cadillac is equipped
with GPS tracking device.
Bam! See? Right there.

He travelled southwest from
Saint Louis across New Mexico.
Looks like he's headed to L.A.

That's perfect, that's what
I'm talking about. Yeah!

Now we're going for a ride.

Oh, and the chief sent an e-mail
about a Detective Malakas...

some task force guy based out
of Beverly Hills,
he's attached to us.

So what? Beautiful. We'll make
him pick us up at the airport.

Huh?

Yeah!

MARIA (O.S.):
Guido, have you ever seen
anything so incredible?

When I was a boy... my father
took me to Mount Assad...

near the Turkish border.

You could see all the way
across the earth until she
turned into herself.

With beauty like this,
how can anyone not have faith
in a higher power?

I have no faith.

Oh, but you do.
You believe in your sister.

She's dead.

She's alive... in you.

Did you kill the man
in your trunk?

Yes.

Did you have to kill him?

I don't know how to stop,
Maria.

When I put my hands
around a man's throat...

and I break his bones...

when I put my knife deep
into his throat...

and I see the life
leave his eyes...

I feel nothing.

I don't feel anything.

Give me your gun, Guido.

What?

We carry the tools of our trade.

The writer, the pen,
the tailor, the needle.

The killer, the gun.

Give me the gun.

What do you want to be?

Give me the other one.

Give me the knife.

Hey! Hey! Hey!

What are you doing? Maria?
Maria? No, no. no, no!

Oh, sh--

What are you doing?

Look, Guido.

Such beauty for all to see.

MALAKAS (O.C.):
Welcome to California, fellas.

All right, boys,
what have you got?

This type of execution,
it look familiar to you?

Oh, my god. No.
Who is it?

Listen, fellas...

you expect my department
to assist you...

on a homicide that took
place in New Jersey...

but you're unwilling to share
information that could
help us to do that?

Well, it's possibly a very
sensitive case, that's all.

Oh, I see, so because
I'm state, I can't be trusted
with a federal case.

No, you misunderstood me.

I'm happy to let you guys
do this one on your own...

believe me, I've got better
things to do.

You want to go back
to the beginning?

That's up to you, my friend.

He's here. He just crossed the
state border this morning.

What happened here?

I don't know, it seems as
though, according to this...

he's been stopped
for like 30 minutes.

15 miles over the border
from Arizona into California.

It looks like somewhere
in San Bernardino.

About 45 minutes from here,
give or take.

All right,
let's check it out.

I want eyeballs on this
immediately. Are we understood?

I'll get my guys right on it.

But I can't do anything
without the information
from the tracking device.

Sure.

Oh, god, there he is.
We gonna get him.

<i> ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

( WHISTLING )

Fuck! The signal,
I lost it.

This a bad area?
Can be.

We're up in the mountains.

No, it just stopped tracking.
The signal is blocked somehow.

Doesn't matter,
we're almost there.

Shit!

Shit, I lost the signal.

No wonder, where are we,
Hooterville? I don't know.

Well, this is where
they stopped?

Yeah.

30 minutes, huh?

He used this stream.

For what?

To cover his tracks.

This is where the signal
started, though, right?

Man is no amateur.

We could be out here for days.
We don't even know what we're
looking for.

Don't worry, my guys
will take care of this.

<i> ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Shit!

( TIRES SCREECHING )

Drop your weapon!

Get out of the car!
Drop your weapon!

Drop your weapon!
Hands on your head!

Keep driving.
It's okay, keep driving.

Put your hands on your head!

Exit the vehicle!
On the ground!

Get on the ground, goddamn it!

Who are these assholes?

You stupid shit.

I guess we're not the only
ones tracking the signal.

I guess not.

Come on, Mr. Fiskin, push.

( GROANS )

Lovely.

Oh, my god.

( PHONE RINGING )

There are two agents,
one old, one young.

The old one,
you got his e-mail address?

You should be running from the
cops, not e-mailing them.

Just shut up and listen.

<i> Get his e-mail for me.</i>

Yeah, I got it right here.
<i> Good.</i>

Weapons possession, that's all
we cold get those guys on?

That's all we could get him on.
Don't worry about that.

We need to focus on the
tracking device.
What's happening with that?

Nothing. I think he found the
device and killed the signal.

I'm dropping you guys
at your hotel.

It's 5:00 in the afternoon.
Who's quitting here?

Nobody's quitting,
just figured you were
exhausted from your trip.

Not at all.

MALAKAS (O.C.):
Look, don't worry,
my guys are on it.

If anything happens, I'll call
you right away. Okay?

I'll tell you what,
why don't you just relax,
I'll be right back.

You need me to come with you?

Of course, I need you.
I need you in the car, okay?

'Cause when that limo comes
in I need you on it.

I am the muscle.
You are the hustle.

Ow.

<i> ( FUNK MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

GUARD (O.S.):
Let's go! Move it!

( DEVICE BEEPING )

Oh, shit!

Holy fuck.

Is there a problem?

No, no problem, just, uh--

Holy fuck,
it is beautiful out here.

Isn't that beautiful?

Yeah, real pretty.

Get in! Get in!
Get in!

Go! Go! Go!

Let's go!

Hey!

Hey! Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

<i> ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Don't worry,
we'll keep you in the loop.

Go. What a dick!
What's up?

Wait, where are we going?
The hotel is back there.

Read that attachment.

It's a list of girl's names and
addresses all over the place.

That boat was from Albania,
right?
Yeah.

It's a prostitution ring,
those girls are kids.

They were kidnapped.

Are you serious?
Where did you get this?

Guido.
How?

Don't matter, he's telling
us to follow the signal,
we're following it.

To where?

I don't know,
it's the only attachment.

And call the chief, tell
him to get some local help here,
but I mean help, all right?

Not this bullshit.
Okay, are you sure?

I'm gonna need assistance
here now and fast.
All right, but are you sure--

Are you fucking kidding me?
We need a team!

Hey! Beverly hills,
all right?

Well, well, well.

Let them know you're here?
I need to see them now.

My fucking shoe!
Help!

<i> ( DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP )</i>

Take off your pants.

Take off your pants!

Now take off
your friend's pants.

Sid, we're moving a couple
of thousand pieces a month.

By the end of this year
it will be ten thousand.

A couple of years from now,
there will be 1.2 billion
dollars.

I see a future for us, Sid.
God Bless America.

What is it?

There's been some developments.

We know. The faggot driver is on
his way here with the body.

The dumb fuck is trying
to play games with us.

I have something you should see.

MALAKAS (O.C.):
Police are on their way.

You're gonna have
to bury both bodies.

Both-- both bodies?
Who's the other body?

You.

Um, let's just-- hold on
one second here, okay?

I can explain what that--

You want to steal from me?
Fucking cocksuckers!

( SPEAKING ALBANIAN )

Oh, shit.

Go, go, go, go!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

It's the Arab.
He's here!

Shit!

( POLICE SIREN WAILING )

Fuck, it's the cops!
Fucking pigs!

What the hell
is going on out there?

Keep your hands
where we can see them!

What, pig?

Hands on your head!

Turn around.
Yes!

Team two, we're coming
in right now.

<i> ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

Help!

Out! Out! Go! Go!

Go! Come on, move it!
Go!

( WOMAN SCREAMING )

You've got nothing.
Nothing!

I've got my gun.

I got a 40-page file.

And the operation is
of a sex traffic in there.

That belongs to you,
mother fucker!

( SPEAKING ALBANIAN )
You sell kids!

Well, it's all going
to Interpol.

Is that all you got?

You just got your
first welcome slap.

You're in my world now.

Are we clear?

<i> ( SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

GEORGI (O.C.):
Guido!

Your friend Jerry
squealed like a little pig.

And now,
you gonna squeal, too.

On your knees... now!

Close your eyes.

Goodbye, cocksucker.

See? Look. Look.

Isn't it beautiful?
I told you.

It's everything you said it was.

We're home now, Guido.

We're home.

Come. Let me get you there
before nightfall, hmm?

No, no, no! Maria! Maria!
Maria! Maria!

Maria! No!
