We all have stories to tell,
       our own paths

      to faith in Christ.

Some are kookier than others

like finding Jesus in a piece
       of drift wood,

yeah more on that in a second,

   but for me I didn't see it
             coming.

I thought I was looking for a
             guy

to stick a ring on my finger,

         my Mr. Right.

   And along the way something
       wonderful happened.

          I found Him.

That's Him with a capital H.

<i> street light got that perfect</i>
         <i> glistening,</i>

touchdown I fall into your arms

   <i> right where I belong your</i>
       <i> everlasting arms.</i>

And where would I be
without yo u

     I'd be packing my bags

      when I need to stay.

  I'd be chasing every breeze

       that blows my way.

   I'd be building my kingdom

  just to watch it fade away.

           It's true.

That's me without you, that's me
          <i> without you</i>

     that's me without you.

Don't know where I'd be without
             <i> you,</i>

that's me without you, that's me
         <i> without you,</i>

<i> that's me without you, without</i>
             <i> you.</i>

Don't know where I'd be without
             <i> you.</i>

that's me without you, that's me
         <i> without you,</i>

<i> that's me without you, without</i>
             <i> you.</i>

     Yeah? It's real good.

I actually took a
trip to Franc e

   a couple years ago. Oh, the
              wine!

Have you ever been to France?

             Ryan?

           Oh sorry.

Yeah France. No I haven't been.

     But I hear it's great.

       Love the accents.

It is better than great, I
      don't know how

  but you can eat anything you
         want there and

  not gain a pound, that is my
             kind of

            country.

And the wine is just to die for
           even the

cheap stuff oh and the Fermat
         of course.

       That cheese right?

I love stinky cheese, it clogs
        the pipes but

             still.

   You know they say the best
        cheese comes from

between French framers toes.

Yup that's probably why it's so
            stinky.

          Incroyable.

       That sounds great.

Listen Gwinny, a friend of mine

        just walked in.

I'm just going to go say hi
        real quick.

OK? This is great. I'll be
       right back.

      -Sure. -OK hold on.

         -Sounds good.

And it's Gwyneth not Gwinny.

It's so rude, the guy couldn't
           keep eye

contact with me for 10 seconds.

           Is it me?

   No sweetie, it's just dumb
          stupid guys.

Ryan is definitely not stupid

         he's a leading
       gastroenterologist.

Which is why he is so full of...

   Gwyneth he just texted me.

      He said he's sorry.

     It was his high school
           sweetheart.

He hasn't seen her in years.

High school sweetheart. Is that
            the one

that's half his age and
   half his weight?

We're running out of guys, our
         husbands are

      running out of guys.

Babe, if you're not careful
     your going to be

     the last one standing.

No, Ann Marie will be the last
         one standing

          guaranteed.

  I am losing here you guys, I
         feel like it's

one of those movies where the
           guy in

a little boat just drifts off
          into the

    horizon and then he just
           disappears.

             Poof!

I don't want to spend another
          Christmas

   under the mistletoe alone.

I just want to meet a guy that
         will look at

me for 10 seconds and smile.

             Sold.

Let's go.

              Dad.

      I'll be in the car.

          Hey Speedy.

What are you going to eat all
         this in one

              day?

   Now you can get it in one.

            Stop it!

        Stop being poor!

Now buy my book and join
    the one percent.

  One minute a day a new you.

This is our first Christmas as
         husband and

             wife.

We met on ChristianMingle.com.

  From our family at Christian
          Mingle, we'd

    like to wish you a Merry
         Christmas and a

        Happy New Year.

           Yea right.

   Joining is easy and free.

   Joining Christian Mingle.

          No, no, no.

Ann Marie will be the last one
           standing

          guaranteed.

You've got to be kidding me.

30 years old and only a couple
         lousy short

   term relationships under my
         belt, pathetic.

  But, it wasn't for a lack of
         trying I dated.

        Boy did I date.

   But most of the time I was
        thinking, get me

     out of here before the
       appetizers arrive.

And I don't know maybe it was
             me.

Either way I was convinced that
            it was

         now or never.

Seriously. And you know what I
            lied.

I didn't just want guy to look
          at me and

             smile.

    I wanted more than that.

I, I wanted a genuinely decent
             guy.

And I knew he was out there.

But, if I was going to find
     him , I'd had to

do something different, totally
          different.

   Happy New Year Ms. Hayden.

           Hey Gwen.

       You look terrible.

           I'm done.

       New year, new me.

I'm buying a dog or joining a
        monastery, or

both if they'll let me bring a
            puppy.

Ladies, everyone on the bridge
        in 5 minutes.

Got big news big, big,
big news .

Pamela, the coffee has
   that foul taste

       again, dish water.

  Not the day for stinky Joe.

   I want you to fix it ASAP.

     Please, pretty please.

      Rodger that admiral.

     Oh, and Happy New Year
           everybody.

    Not today, I cannot play
       battleship with him

             today.

You ever think if it's the guy
         your picking

        to go out with?

Maybe your knocking on one door
            hoping

       another will open.

      Oh, thank you Oprah.

      Don't call me Oprah.

  Have either of you heard of

         Donny De Bona?

     Is that really a name?

He is the biggest name in
     direct response

        for male beauty.

  Oh, you're talking about the
         infomerical guy

with, with the weird goatee.

              Oh.

     I am talking about the
     infomercial king, and

he is coming here today on his
         private jet.

He is coming in at O-1100 hours

        to meet with us.

  To discuss if he wants us to
         single-handedly

   market his newest product.

             Hair.

          As in wigs?

          Transplant?

             Hair.

             Hair!

        The real thing.

     He has found a cure for
            baldness.

He found a secret solution and
        he puts it in

       a little capsule.

      This is ridiculous.

  There's no secret solution.

      You take that back.

           I mean it.

Okay fine, I take it back but...

No buts. This is the
real thing .

I've done my research, I'm not
          an idiot.

       We are done here.

   I want you to assemble the
             troops.

        Clear the decks.

  I want a reception fit for a
           president.

         Now hurry up!

           Dismissed.

I can take almost anything,
       spin it into

gold and fool some of the
   people some of the

             time.

But, I don't care how you brand
          it, package

         it or sell it.

If God didn't give you hair,
          you aint

  getting hair. End of story.

     Ladies and gentlemen.

       Mr. Donny De Bona.

   I'm sure you don't need any
         introduction to

          Mr. De Bona.

You know him as the man who has

revolutionized the way modern
       men live their

          daily lives.

Now Mr. De Bona is at it again,

bigger and better than ever.

And from what I understand he's
          here for a

few days to kick our tires and
          if we pass

the test we will be the lucky
        firm to brand

and market Mr. De Bona's newest
            product

and if that day comes,
  then you , me, we,

   all of us will be a part of
            history.

           The story.

             A man.

     Let's meet the troops.

       They're all yours.

          let's chat.

      Good to see you Rex.

             Donny.

  Hello there. Donny De bona.

       Okay let's review.

        So no Mr. Right

  and now I've gotta make bald
              guys

believe some magical potion
      they buy on TV

    is gonna solve all their
            problems.

At this point I'm like "God, if
          you are out

there, this is Gwyneth Hayden
       calling and uh

             help."

        -This is wrong.
        -What's wrong?

         -Hi, I'm sorry.
       -No, no I'm sorry.

    I'm sorry that I'm late.

    Hi, I'm, I'm Paul Wood.

      Gwyneth Hayden. Hi.

I wish that I had an excuse for
            you but

honestly I'm just terribly with
             time

          management.

I mean Papa warned me it would
            be my

            undoing.

             -Papa?
          -Oh, My dad.

              Oh.

          -Should we?
          -Yeah sure.

             What?

            Nothing.

    It's the photo isn't it?

Yeah I don't really look
    like my picture.

I kind of cheated on that part.

          Who doesn't?

Mine was from like 10 years ago
          back when I

was on my way to rock stardom.

             Yeah!

   You were going to be a rock
              star?

Well, you know, an entertainer.

      Oh, an entertainer.

      That's interesting.

    This is weird isn't it?

    It's a weird way to meet
            somebody.

   What a strange new world.

             It is.

It's like click, meet, marry,
         die, done.

It's a very strange new world.

   But the stuff between never
         really changes.

   Family, joy, a love for the
              Lord.

      Yeah gotta love Him.

           The Lord.

Well hey do you want something
          to drink?

    Hey, how about a cookie?

   Oh no I don't do cookies.

    It's a double chin coming
         quicker than a

         freight train.

      How about a cookie?

             Sold.

             What?

            Nothing.

         You're great.

   Yeah well you're awesome.

I would've been okay with okay.

Coffee would be great though.

        Black, no sugar.

Uncomplicated and a believer.

           That's me.

          I like that.

        Believer or not.

           Thank you.

Dear Lord, yes, we just want to
           thank you

for the coffee and the cookie,
          and really

most of all the coffee and the
        talent of the

   baristas that prepared it.

   Although I am just drinking
        black so I guess

that really doesn't take a lot
              of

          barista-ing.

            But um.

We also just want to say a
    huge , super huge

thanks for bringing Paul and I
           together

because he is just, he's very
       cool and - you

really did good thank you - and
          I just want

   to thanks for old photos.

              Yes.

         -Amen. -Amen.

I have never prayed over coffee
            before.

I mean you can't pray enough in
          this click,

       meet, marry world.

           That's it?

   You're stopping there now?

     No more die and done?

No I might wanna, I don't know
         wanna have a

few laughs or something before
            that.

       Sounds good to me.

So, what do people call you?

            Gwinny?

Not if you want to
see tomorrow .

Sixth grade summer camp didn't
          end well.

You can just call me Gwyneth.

         Gwyneth it is.

          I like you.

         You got spunk.

             Spunk?

It's a little 'Brady Bunch'
       but , I don't

   know; it might grow on me.

This is a guy you met online!

I know, but it's not like that.

It's a very popular and legit
           dating

  website, not to mention it's
           Christian.

   Which brings us to problem
           number two:

     You're not Christian.

           Says who?

  I believe in God and stuff.

I mean I was baptized, I
     went to Sunday

School, I read the Bible when I
         was a kid...

you know, the one with all the
            pretty

          pictures...

and I go to church sometimes.

             When?

    When is the last time you
         stepped into a

            church?

          Last month.

You went to church last month?

             I did.

              And?

   Okay, so it was a wedding.

         Whose wedding?

   I don't know, but it was so
           beautiful.

   Oh, you crashed a wedding.

              No!

     I just peaked inside.

  It's not like I
followed them to the

  reception and chowed down on
          free shrimp.

And that was the last time you
          were in a

           church...

     peaking in a wedding?

             Yeah.

      It was so beautiful.

        This is so sad.

   Okay, that doesn't count.

You're not Christian or
   whatever this guy

        thinks you are.

    That website is for real
       Christians looking

   for other real Christians.

Do you see the problem here?

Okay, you are making this
     a much heavier

religious issue than it
   needs to be, and

besides, I think I'm at
   least 50 percent

that kind of Christian anyway.

I'm pretty sure it's either/or,
          not just a

       slice of the pie.

            Ladies.

      Gwyneth, you are up.

Well she's all yours, God help
             her.

Actually I'd like a few minutes
          alone with

     Ms. Hayden if I might.

Well then I'll just leave you
         two to it.

    You don't bite, do you?

              Nah.

     What do we have here?

    Gwyneth Hayden, BP, Brand
           Management.

           That's me.

What's brand management, in
      your own words?

Well I think I take the story...

the good, the bad and the ugly
          of it all.

I mix it in a bowl, I add some
         sugar and I

      make it taste good.

    And you're good at that?

         I think I am.

You're not a believer, are you?

             uh....

        I'm sorry, what?

  You don't believe that I can
           grow hair.

              Oh.

           Oh, that.

             um...

           I just...

      You mean with these?

          Well I can.

  I can, and I can prove it to
              you.

       Before and after.

         Before, after.

      Pictures don't lie.

         Scout's honor.

Scout's honor then, I'm good.

   And it's all right there.

       Before and after.

  Yes, we're going on a second
              date.

I mean he's a little like
    out of 'Leave it

to Beaver' but you guys, he was
         so charming.

Oh honey, switch the channel.

    This can only end badly.

              End?

       What do you mean?

      It's just beginning.

Sweetie, you're desperate and
           you're

      grasping at straws.

      You guys, no, stop.

        He is fantastic.

  I mean isn't this what we've
         been trying to

             do...

    get me a fella and get me
            hitched?

    My family has been in the
          construction

   business for generations.

    Papa's papa, he was a big
       development guy so

   he sort of turned it into a
          bigger deal.

Now papa has taken it to
    a whole 'nother

             level.

So do you work a lot with your
            hands?

      Oh no, gosh, I wish.

  No, I'm kind of stuck in the
             office.

          Oh, really?

          Doing what?

       Analysis, mostly.

Feasibility reports on
 potential projects.

Oh, so you basically sniff out
        the stinkers.

Yeah, I guess that's one way to
            put it.

           Sushi up.

         Oh, thank you.

        Looks delicious.

             Okay.

            Dig in.

   You're not really a fan of
         sushi, are you?

      Is it that obvious?

             Yeah.

You know that funny thing
    you're doing with

     your nose, your stinker
            detector?

It's kind of a dead giveaway.

I mean you look like you just
         smelled dog

             poop.

Not really helping the
   situation here.

Well why didn't you just
     tell me that?

Because I kind of wanted to try
              it.

  You know, it's the in thing,
             right?

This red one here,
        this is tuna,

and this here, the yellow one,
              is

 yellowtail, which is
technically a different

         kind of tuna.

The brown one is eel, and then
        this orangey,

mushy-looking one is uni, which
            is sea

            urchin.

        It is delicious.

       It's my favorite.

Well maybe I'll try that one.

       Looks interesting.

         You know what?

     On second thought, no.

      Let's pass on that.

Sea urchin is not
gateway sushi .

   Just take your chopsticks,
        right, and let's

     just start right here.

      Okay, that'll work.

Here, you can dip it in the soy
            and...

            uh huh.

         Here it goes.

              Mmm.

You are gonna actually have to
          swallow at

          some point.

          It's coming.

         Here it goes.

              Oh!

   Not exactly sure what just
            happened.

You just chewed that poor tuna
         to death is

         what happened.

I guess I'm just more of a
     chili cheese dog

          kind of guy.

   Someone's gonna get hurt.

    Do you have any idea what
          happened at a

          Bible study?

             What?

            to gas.

Got to get away from here fast.

Enemies breathing down my neck
        and trying to

grad a hold and make me wreck.

Hot on my tail trying to
    make me fail and

trying to take the wind up out
         of my sail.

Trying to roll me
off this road .

Don't look at what's behind.

         There you are.

     Thought you got lost.

          No, no, no.

           Here I am.

        You look great.

       Come in, come in.

        Meet everybody.

Everyone, this is Gwyneth, and
         whatever you

   do, don't call her Gwinny.

          Ah ha ha ha.

        Okay, let's see.

First that's Jimmy and Jessie
          McKenzie.

    They're happy newlyweds.

         Met on Mingle.

Turned me onto it, praise the
            Lord.

        Praise the Lord.

   And this is their beautiful
              home.

   And that's Tommy and Gabby
        Huntley, who are

         having a baby.

           My belly!

        Praise the Lord.

            Indeed.

      And that's Kel-Kel.

            Hi, hi.

             Kelly.

  Heck, you want to talk about
           summer camp

  stories, we got a few of our
              own.

          Bible camp.

   Believe me, it's nothing.

Okay, let me see if I have it.

    We have Jimmy and Jessie
       McKenzie, Tommy and

Gabby Huntley, who are having a
         baby in your

belly, and summer camp Kelly.

   So you should just call me
             Gwinny.

            Really?

             Sure.

   This, This place is great.

It's all so inspirational and
          marriage,

marriage that's just, I mean,
         it actually

     reminds me of one of my
           favorites.

Yeah I think the passage is
      from Galatians.

  Because of the temptation to
             sexual

immorality each man should have
         his own wife

and each woman should have her
         own husband.

You know what, my bad, I think
           that was

          Corinthians.

   Yep that was Corinthians.

           So sorry.

     Do you have any water?

             Sure.

           Thank you.

             C'mon.

     Hi how ya doing buddy.

I'm sorry, I'm not really good
           with you

            people.

Well you seem pretty good with
            Pauly.

    He's just so different.

He's the last of the good ones,
          that's for

             sure.

    I hope things work out.

I haven't seen him this
   happy in a while.

            Really?

Well I must be doing something
         right then.

So great to have
everybody back .

Jessie, Jimmy, thank you
    guys so much for

  your hospitality again, once
             again.

And Gwinny it's just awesome to
           have you

            with us.

So, uh let's pick up where we
        left off last

week, Romans 7 we were uh,
        Verse 14.

Now everybody's familiar with
        the story of

    Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

     You know what I think?

     No, what do you think?

You should stick to Gwyneth.

          Just be you.

        Whoever that is.

The trouble is with me for I am
            all too

     human, a slave to sin.

Well the pressure's
bleeding in .

Giving me some blurry vision.

    Fogging up my intellect.

    Where love and hate they
           intersect.

Keep the path of the mission.

Never going to lose
my ambition .

Got my eyes up on the prize.

         Eyes forward.

Don't look at what's behind.

         Eyes forward.

  Don't take your eyes off the
             prize.

I told Mom about that raw fish.

          Oh you did?

Boy did she get a kick out of
            that.

So what's the deal
with Kel-Kel ?

              Who?

    Kelly from Bible Study.

            Oh that?

         Oh no nothing.

           Honestly.

  We, she's practically like a
             sister.

    We grew up together, our
            families.

Although if mama had her way?

You and Kelly would be about 3
          kids and 2

      dogs deep right now?

       The barking kind.

oh, the next stop, the
  deliciou s train.

     I like it around here.

          It's funky.

         Funky spunky.

Okay so I told you I wanted to
          be a rock

             star.

       So what about you?

Did you have any other dreams?

             Um...

yeah, I always actually wanted
           to be a

            teacher.

       Wow that's noble.

         What happened?

    Well I went to school and
          graduated and

needed a job and looked for a
       meaningful job

and there just wasn't one so I
        kind of faked

   my way to a living until I,
          funny enough,

ended up in a line of work
     where faking it

   is actually part of the job
          description.

  So, how long have you been a
            believer?

    You know, it's, it's just
        such a long and,

   you know, personal story.

Maybe it's for another time if
         that's okay.

      Oh yeah absolutely.

    Though you have peaked my
           curiosity.

  You know what they say about
          curiosity and

            the cat.

What about you though, if you
        don't mind me

            asking?

       No, no not at all.

I was kind of born into it, I
           guess.

All the men on mama- my
  mother's side were

  pastors going back forever.

  So, my papa's- my dad's side
            different

             story.

    He was a crazy kid my dad
        growing up in the

         60's and all.

     Drifting through life.

Then as the story goes he was
        walking on a

   beach one day, and he came
        across this piece

     of driftwood and he saw
        something in it.

    So he took it home and he
        studied it and he

   studied it, and he ended up
        carving a statue

      of Jesus out of it.

   Next thing you know, spirit
           fills him,

   changes his life forever.

        Just like that.

     Lights off, lights on.

      Flick of the switch.

   Let me get this straight.

You're telling me your dad, who
             was a

drifter as you say, and whose
          last name

happens to be Wood
 finds a piece of

driftwood on the beach and
    finds Jesus in it

   and bam, he's born again?

Wow, I've never seen that angle
            before.

      Are you kidding me?

   It was laying right there.

         No seriously!

             Snap!

      That is so creative.

  How do you just come up with
           that all so

            quickly?

    It's kind of what I do.

Well anyway, my driftwood
     moment actually

    happened when I was 13.

I entered the science fair at
        school and I

built this maze for mice to run
           through.

I had them in 2 cages,
the mice .

In one cage I had flashing red
          lights and

head banging music going 24/7
         and in the

other one I had soft blue light
              and

        classical music.

My hypothesis was that,
    the mice in the

tripped out cage would run the
         maze faster

because they're all hyped
    up and the mellow

mice would just wander through
           without

         really caring.

And then right before every run
         I would give

each mouse a sniff of this big
           chunk of

Swiss cheese that I had at the
          end of the

       maze, their prize.

   This is actually me but I'm
          fascinated, I

       want to hear more.

            Oh, Ok.

It was somewhere in the middle
          of it all,

none of that mattered anymore
        because I got

so fixated on the notion of the
            cheese.

  That prize that both sets of
           mice had a

  scent of and ultimately were
            drawn to.

Each had their own path,
    but the goal was

           the same.

Don't tell me you saw Jesus in
         the cheese.

          No, no um..

But, it reminded me like so
      much of what I

    had been doing as a kid.

Searching for something that I
         had a sense

  of but couldn't quite put my
           finger on.

    suddenly it all clicked.

          The cheese.

Jesus' love was waiting for me.

    So that weekend I won the
        science fair, and

        found my prize.

       A love in Christ.

      Well sweet Cheesus.

         Sweet Cheese!

         Sweet Cheesus.

     You find the funny in
     everything, don't you?

           I'm sorry.

        No I like funny.

         The world could
     definitely use a little

        funny right now.

         Are you happy?

   You know, are you content?

        Yeah I think so.

              Wow.

         Big question.

I'm happier now that I've met
         you, that's

           for sure.

            Flatter.

You working overtime for that
          goodnight

             kiss?

              No.

       Well then no kiss.

             Okay.

        Are you serious?

          Absolutely.

<i> Worn out with blisters on your</i>
            <i> feet.</i>

  To anyone with a heart that

<i> shattered, doing your best to</i>
           <i> hold it</i>

           together.

    with no prayer to pray.

You're not going back to 1950s
           sweetie

    you're going to church.

  You know I want to scare his
          parents right

        out of the gate.

         Keep shopping.

I think I can make this work.

Yeah, if you're playing
  Margaret Thatcher.

   Aren't you a little worried
         about all this

          pretending.

I'm not pretending I genuinely
          like him.

    I do, and you know what?

That is so cute I just want to
              be

          respectful.

And dressing like Julia
    Child is being

          respectful.

     Or apparently any other
       character recently

    played by Meryl Streep.

  Thank You that is so sweet.

       Nice to meet you.

        What am I doing.

    standing at an open door

       this is your life

        never live twice

step through to the other side

            Gwyneth.

         Oh, I'm sorry.

  How do you feel about that?

       It's just so big.

   Hundred and twenty seven by
         forty five and

sixty three feet closer to the
         other shore.

        Steak and cake.

        I'm sorry what?

How do you feel about steak and
             cake?

     We're all going there.

Don't tell me you've never had
          steak and

             cake.

   Oh are you in for a treat.

             Amen.

    Have you met our Kelly.

I have hi nice to
see you again .

      Well alrighty then.

    Let's steak and cake it.

Your mother doesn't like me.

What are you talking about of
         course she

             does.

She doesn't even know you, and
         speaking of

which is it just me or have you
            always

    dressed like my grandma.

I just didn't want to stick out
             cause

           sometimes.

         She likes you.

I promise you are reading way
        too much into

              it.

             Paul.

            Coming.

   Gwyneth we would all be so
         honored if you

        would say Grace.

           Of course.

Dear Lord, thanks a bunch for
        new friends.

It's really not often in life
         that we get

          such a gift.

People that are just kind and
        generous, and

          so thank you

and, and for this food golly

I mean steak and cake it's kind
          of hard to

    know which to eat first.

But, I guess it's all going to
           the same

    place so we are just very
       thankful for that.

    And, we thank you for the
        abundance of all

             of it.

There is just so much, and we
        thank you for

 the cows who are
willing to give up

          themselves.

And that this food is going to
         nourish our

bodies, and we really just sit
              in

     awesomeness, and really
         I have a great

      amount of gratitude.

         So, yes Amen.

      In Jesus' name Amen.

Oh yes in Jesus' name I
  mean all of that of

course was in Jesus' name Amen.

Alrighty to the almighty lets
           dig in.

   Paul, have you told Gwyneth
            about our

         mission trip?

Yeah, we're just all so blessed
          and excited

     last year when we were
       vacationing on the

         Mayan Riviera.

    The Yucatan Peninsula the
         Caribbean side.

             Right.

Well, we took this fantastic
      day trip to see

some of the ancient sites the
       Mayan pyramids

            and all.

We came across this beautiful
         little town

  called San Luis De Piscopo.

Oh, just a stone's throw from
        where we were

            staying.

        A stone's throw.

Yeah, well the town is
   almost in ruins.

Evidently they haven't really
          recovered

  since hurricane Wilma struck
             there.

Three years ago, category 5
      just blew this

     little place to bits.

   Grace, let the boy finish.

             Sorry.

          Well really.

             go on.

Really that's it I mean most of
          the people

just, left you know, abandoned
          the place,

  sort of just lost their way,
            gave up.

         Faith an all.

         That's right.

Door to door we shall restore.

  Bill, who needs to hush now?

Door to door was real good,
      take a note of

             that.

Anyway, right there smack
    in the middle of

it their church crumbling, it's
           symbolic

they haven't opened their door
            since.

The bell literally fell to the
          ground and

     that's where it sits.

           So tragic.

  But, with the help of Papa's
         company and the

       good Lord's grace.

    We are going to fix it.

Door to door, we shall restore.

            Oh yeah.

    So, I'm, I'm just curious
        exactly how long

does it take to re-hang a bell?

       Long as it takes.

We will be there
till she rings .

Not a ding or a dong sooner.

Papas got it all pretty
 keyed in down there.

So, we're thinking maybe a
      month at most.

   Or, until the bell rings.

        It's cake time.

  I want Chaco Latto, please.

Wait, I'm sorry you're going to
         Mexico for a

             month?

   It's going to be awesome.

  So wait, when do you leave?

     Like tomorrow, night.

        Praise the Lord.

I'm sorry but I, I thought you
          would have

           told her.

  I was going to, and I should
            have but,

you know we just met and to say
             that

I was leaving for so long I, I
           just...

   I understand, I understand
           really and

honestly I'm sorry that I made
            things

       difficult for you.

     But, I did think that

  you wouldn't have told her.

   Paul, you know I only want
         what's best for

              you.

           Of course.

Well, don't you think there is
          something

just a little off about her.

              Off?

    Out of place, peculiar.

   I mean don't get me wrong.

I'm sure she's a sweet
  girl and , and I'm

    sure she means well but.

           But what?

    Forgive me, but there is
          something not

    genuine going on there.

Alright now there I said it.

            How so?

    You really don't see it.

           See what?

Oh sweetie you are just being
         blinded by

             love.

I'm really not following here.

Paul, she is hiding something.

         No she isn't.

     You know what I think?

I think this is you with
    all due respect,

    Mom stepping in the way.

You like to trying to control
       the situation.

Please don't do that, not here
           not this

             time.

I like Gwyneth I really, really
         like her and

     I think she's awesome.

    Admit it she is a little
         different, but

that's what I like about her.

I think she does mean well and
            she is

genuine, and I'm going to prove
          it to you.

          How is that?

    I don't know but I will.

       I'm buying a dog.

Oh well, I mean he was a really
           nice guy.

   He was but, he was kind of
             goofy.

  And between his mama and his
             papa it

probably wouldn't work anyway.

     What about a Bulldog?

       Onward and upward.

         Onward anyway.

You know I just he would have
         given me a

           heads up.

        It's so unfair.

     Has he tried calling?

      Yeah about a hundred
       times but I am not

   answering I'm gonna let him
          sweat it out.

And they say romance is dead.

There was something about
    it al l though I

           gotta say.

Everyone just seemed so happy.

      Surprise inspection.

        De Bona is here.

He wants to see some ideas now.

I guess he's keeping us on our
            toes.

           But, I...

     No buts! Just genius.

      Pamela, cup of Joe.

             Quick.

           Thank you.

         I don't know.

Maybe I should start with them,
           or oh no.

           This one.

Yeah, this one right here for
            sure.

Ok, so this is gonna be a
    little out there.

So if you kinda just
go with me .

            Hang on.

Alright, so we are going
    to kill baldness

     with the blue bullet.

   Most men I know view their
            follicly

challenged head as a life-long
           nemesis.

And men being men, they want to
          destroy the

         enemy, right?

So how are we gonna do that?

    We are going to kill it.

         That's right.

      With a blue bullet.

             Right?

Do you see where I'm going with
             this?

You know we can even have,
     like , a little

   dispenser, that's actually
          shaped like a

              gun.

           You know?

Shoots out the blue bullets, or
           we could

call it the Bald Bullet, even
           better.

        Or just Bullet.

You know, we could get a really
         good looking

  bald Steve McQueen-type male
             model.

       You know, Bullet?

           The movie?

              No?

    I'm gonna pass on that.

  That's mixed messages and in
          this current

          environment.

   And with all the gun issues
           right now.

       It's, It's toxic.

             Toxic.

          Yeah, toxic.

           Too toxic.

             Okay.

         You know what?

          Absolutely.

  We are just gonna - shifting
           gears here.

Going in a whole new different
          direction.

         Ah, literally.

Everyone wants someone to blame
           for their

deficiencies, especially men.

        All due respect.

           So sorry.

But when men look in the
    mirror , and you

           know what?

          Also women.

We cannot forget that there are
           plenty of

     bald women out there.

  Boy you can say that again.

      My mother was bald.

   Mamma Debona had alopecia.

     Bald as a baby's butt.

   Very tragic, very tragic.

             What?

       Sorry about that.

             Okay.

  Yeah so, when we look in the
             mirror.

I mean when we really
   see who we are.

       Who we really are.

  Sometimes we just don't take
         responsibility

            for it.

So, we want someone to blame,
           right?

And who are we going to blame
           for our

           baldness?

I think naturally we blame the
          thing that

          created us.

         That's right.

   We're going to blame God.

        Right up there.

              God.

          Blaming God.

Looking at God, going 'you know
             what?

            Why me?

          Why me, God?

            Why me?

Why can't you just help me God?

         You know what?

     God hears your cries.

     He hears your cries of
          desperation.

   And he has mercy because he
        is a loving God,

  and he has given us Heaven's
              Rain.

         Heaven's Rain?

        Yes, he made it.

   And with a little faith and
         Heaven's Rain,

       he can re-make it.

             Water.

              Wow.

         You know what?

     Can't you take a hint?

       Alright, alright.

              Hey.

You know, I'm trying to be mad
           at you.

I think, I think I owe you an
          apology.

         No, you don't.

No, that wasn't the coolest way
          to tell you

   I was leaving for a while.

         Paul, listen.

This is hard to say, but I just
          don't know

if we're really, I mean you are
         such a sweet

  guy, you really are, but...

   You should come down here.

             What?

            Mexico!

         Come on down.

            Gwyneth?

        Yeah, I'm here.

          I just, wow.

That's - I mean, I mean, when?

              Now.

            I can't.

     I mean I really can't.

I mean we're in the middle of
          something

   really huge here at work.

     Oh, one second please?

         Heaven's Rain!

         Heaven's Rain!

              God!

Little blue bullets from a gun?

What planet are you living on!

          Voodoo guru?

Listen, you'd better shape
      up or ship out

             missy.

I told you not to blow this!

       I'll pay for that.

      Are you still there?

           You're on.

   Wait please, where are you
             taking

           my stuff?

         It's all good.

        That's my stuff.

        Hey, it's okay.

       Welcome to Mexico.

         It's all good.

     Buenos Dias, stranger!

              Hey!

      Ha ha, there she is!

Listen, you want something for
          the trots,

       just let me know.

    I got something for ya.

             Great.

     So what do you think?

            It's...

              Well

     Buenos Dias senorita!

            It's...

            awesome.

I kinda packed more beach, sand
              and

          surf-ish...

          You're fine.

          That works!

          Don't worry.

        You look pretty.

    Well, I'll just take some
         vacation time.

   I mean I have three years'
             worth.

   I have worked through every
        holiday known to

man to make these deadlines.

          He owes me.

       You're in Mexico?

       On a mission trip?

   It's not like I'm not doing
         something good

           down here.

  I mean we're all wearing the
         same shirt and

      making a difference.

I'm going to knock these sticks
           together,

  bang bang bang, slap on some
          paint, brush

   brush brush, and then Paul
        and I can head to

       the Mayan Riviera.

   Where we can have
margaritas and gulp and

   gulp and gulp and watch the
        sunset, into the

           Caribbean.

It's a win win for everyone.

Except for the poor suckers who
          paid a ton

to watch the sun sink into the
           Pacific,

which is what it normally does.

Oh, okay so sue me Pam I'm bad
        at geography.

I don't care, listen, I am so
           sick of

            normal.

     I just want paradise.

    His version of paradise.

   And if the sweet Lord is my
         ticket to that,

         then so be it.

        All the better.

I mean I'm here two weeks, life
           goes on.

         There you are.

          uh, uh, uh.

        I'm losing you!

            No, no.

It's a really bad connection.

  I know that's you you... no,
            come on.

     I'm sorry, thank you.

        Everything okay?

    Yeah, just checking in.

She did not just hang up on me.

             Oh my.

           yon city.

      Holding up the wall?

Your dad has a beautiful voice.

         Yeah he does.

I see where you got your dreams
          of being a

           rock star.

         It's amazing.

          What's that?

  Just given everything that's
            happened.

        The devastation.

Everyone just seems, so okay,
       so just happy.

When your peace comes from God
         no storm can

            take it.

Yeah, I spill a drop of wine on
           my carpet

   and I have a heart attack.

          Go bonkers.

             Okay.

  The temperature really drops
          here at night

              huh?

             Yeah.

            Savior.

             down.

Let us love one another for
      love comes from

              God.

Everyone who loves has been
      born of God and

           knows God.

Whoever does not love does not
          know God,

      because God is love.

Anyone who does not love does
        not know God

      because God is love.

        1st John 4:7-8.

    Would anybody like to say
         anything about

             that?

             Maria.

   That's a very good question
             Maria.

            Gwyneth.

Would you like to take a crack
            at it?

   I'm, I'm sorry, I just, my
            Spanish.

    I don't - I don't think I
         understood the

           question.

Maria wanted to know why, if
      God loves us so

much, he let happened to their
         village what

           happened.

If God is love, why did he let
         this happen?

    Well, that is a very good
         question Maria.

And not an easy one to answer.

    But I know there are many
        wonderful answers

            in here.

          Let me see.

     How about James 1:7-8?

    I think that addresses it
       beautifully, don't

              you?

              Yes.

   That is exactly what I was
            thinking.

     You are exactly right.

           Let's see.

   And that was the end of the
              road.

           They knew.

       I knew they knew.

And they knew I knew they knew.

            Perfect.

Now the only question was how I
           was gonna

get out of there with any trace
          of dignity.

              Hey.

              Hey.

I was just hunkering down with
         the men folk

        about tomorrow.

       Lots to get done?

             Yeah.

   But we will get 'er done.

       I'm sure you will.

I mean God willing of course.

      God willing, right?

          You hungry?

        Not really, no.

  Can I talk to you a minute?

  You're not enjoying this are
              you?

             What?

         you seem lost.

         Are you lost?

       I don't - kind of.

     You know what I think?

          Straight up.

       You're pretending.

   Pretending to be something
           you're not.

    Why would you say that?

         Just a hunch.

          Am I right?

     Not, completely but...

      You're not really a

        believe are you?

    There's that word again.

              Wow.

     I guess I'm confused.

       I like you a lot.

There's nothing confusing about
             that.

        And I like you.

             A lot.

              So?

Being a believer what does that
          even mean?

I'm Christian, I believe
     in God , I was

baptized, all of that stuff.

Are we really that different?

You gonna figure all that out
         with this?

    Where did you find that?

Did someone go
through my stuff ?

     Because that so not...

    One of the kids found it

when they were cleaning out the
          bunk house.

     It was under your cot.

They gave it to my mom, and she
          gave it to

              me.

  Tell me if this sounds about
             right.

All your life you've done some
        searching for

           something.

       Something bigger.

Every now and again maybe you
          can call

     yourself a Christian.

            Why not?

  It's easy, gives it a name.

So you say, "I believe in God".

And for the most part it works.

Covers the bases, satisfies
      that underlying

need to understand it deeper.

  You kinda go with the common
              flow.

And then something bad happens
         and you look

   around see all the terrible
          things in the

             world.

Compound that with the general
        negative spin

  on religion and you just get
          turned off to

              it.

     God, faith, all of it.

    So you, toss it all out.

   Back and forth, accept it,
           reject it.

      How's that sounding?

          About right.

Honestly, some of the stuff out
          there, you

would not be human if you
     didn't question

              it.

      So help me out here.

When you went online, Christian
            Mingle.

What exactly were
you expecting ?

    Honestly, I don't know.

I just saw the website and, all
           of these

         happy people.

   And the guys just seemed, I
           don't know.

All of the guys that I have, I
          have been

   dating were just so full of
           themselves.

    And I saw your pictures.

   And your smile and you just
          seemed like a

          genuine guy.

    But, then you lied about
            yourself.

              Why?

     Well isn't it obvious?

Because if I hadn't, then, then
             you.

What does it matter because in
         the end, we

           did meet.

And, Paul I really like you,
       and according

  to you, you really like me a
              lot.

              So.

         I do like you.

But whoever I am with I gotta
        feel totally

   comfortable sharing what's
        important to me.

And having a relationship with
            Christ

through the good and the bad,
        that is, that

  is more important to me than
            anything.

And I, I can't, I can't share
       that with you.

Not if it's not true for you.

That's who I was looking for.

    So, what are you saying?

I'm not sure, I'm, I mean I'm
          confused

            myself.

     Because I do like you.

       I really like you.

           Well okay.

Then, unless you are under some
          contractual

obligation please your
 mother by being with

   a gal, that she thinks you
         should be with,

i.e., Kel-Kel which is not me.

Then maybe you could slowly
     help me get to a

   place that works for you.

   That works for both of us.

       I would like that!

Maybe, you could help show
     me my driftwood.

   I don't think it works like
              that.

       Not for me anyway.

I just wished that you hadn't
            lied.

    Maybe if you didn't-mm.

         I don't know.

         I don't know.

           So, should

         I just leave?

      I like you so much.

       I'm really sorry.

         Yeah, Me too.

            Me too.

That was just about one of the
        worst moments

          of my life.

But, things were exactly as
      they were meant

             to be.

  I think it is called Grace.

Don't say I didn't tell you.

             Yeah.

  Christians looking for other
           Christians.

      I really liked him.

            I know.

         Yes, come in.

         Hey, Hey um..

         How you doing?

     I'm glad you are back.

     That was pretty fast.

    You, are, are you feeling
             better?

           Ah, what?

   I know you want to keep it
           between us.

     But, the strep throat.

Oh, oh yeah the strep throat,

             yeah,

it's a little scratchy but you
         know what I

    am doing so much better.

           Thank you!

          That's good.

That's good and, and so you're
         back at it?

With, with the De bona thing?

           Yes, yes.

   That's splendid, splendid.

    Well, then as you were.

           Thank you.

   Thank you, but strep throat
             really?

  You could of just said the a
           cold or the

              flu.

You had to go all dramatic with
             strep

            throat?

Hey, you said a couple of weeks
           so that's

       what I bought ya.

      news lie admit-ion .

   I got my eyes on the path.

      My eyes on the path.

        We are in here!

        We are in here!

Oh I used to love this program.

    Never miss a day of it.

     I keep it on for her.

   OK, it's a little catchy.

You know these people never to

      seem to leave town.

    Or get older, evidently.

Alright Gwen, What's going on?

       Is it chain again?

        Yeah, it clinks.

            Clinks?

Or maybe it's more of a clunk.

     Sure it's not a clank?

        Like last time?

No, it's definitely a clink.

It's like clink, clink, clink,
            clink.

        I got, I got it.

           I got it.

          Thanks dad.

Oh, it's a different day, huh?

             Yeah.

I meet my wife in high school.

I married her right afterward
        and loved her

till the day she passed and oh,
              no.

       Eleven years ago.

  You ever think about getting
         back out there?

       You know, dating?

         Da-da-dating?

              Me?

    No, no, no, no, no, no.

    She was my one and only.

  Sometimes we wait for God to
          make the next

move when God is saying, "It's
         your time to

act", "your time to act", "your
            time to

             act".

We have had a lot of
  opportunity walk

       through our door.

   Some better, some worse and
           ninety-nine

percent of the time I have been
         able to doll

             it up.

Give it a makeover, and make it
         the queen of

           the ball.

     Correct or incorrect?

    I would say that's a fair
           evaluation.

  But, that's not 100% is it?

Douglas, I have to have an
     ounce of belief

         in something.

        A half an ounce.

Just a drop of it to do what I
             do.

To find the angle, the magic.

This De Bona stuff, all of it,
             it's

            just...

             Stop!

      Don't say that word.

If you say it, it becomes truth
            and you

      can't go back on it.

  You're the one who made that
              rule!

         I can't do it.

          It's false.

Look, Gwyneth, this isn't the
         first time

you've had to make the leap.

But I can't do it this time.

   That's what this is about.

  On the record, I want to say
          that I think

this hair thing is the real
     deal and I think

it is going to grow hair, not
       just because I

          want it to.

  I'm sorry Douglas but I just
          can't do it.

         Not this time.

         Not with this.

Not, with any of it anymore.

  I think I've just pushed the
           boundary so

far, and bought into the dung
        for so long.

And suspended a sense of
  belief , and what we

            do here.

  And in, my life that I don't
            even know

what's true or real anymore.

      I've gotta believe.

I just needed to start at the
         beginning.

       Everyone welcome?

         Pam was right.

I had been knocking on one door
            hoping

      another would open.

    Give it all back to me.

    What I've done for you.

     What I do through you.

    Give it all back to me.

<i> Give it all back to me (That's</i>
        <i> what the Lord</i>

             said).

  <i> Give it all back to me (What</i>
         <i> I've done for</i>

             you).

    What I've done for you.

     What I do through you.

    Give it all back to me.

Give it all back.

Give it all back.

    What I've done for you.

     What I do through you.

    Give it all back to me.

<i> Give it all back.</i>

Give it all back.

    What I've done for you.

     What I do through you.

    Give it all back to me.

    I won't share my glory.

With no one else (I won't share
         <i> with no one</i>

    else so don't you try).

   Don't you try to keep it.

         For yourself.

Don't you ever take the credit.

    <i> You didn't earn it, you</i>
       <i> shouldn't get it.</i>

Don't you know that pride comes
         <i> before every</i>

             fall.

<i> Give it back, back, back, all</i>
            <i> back.</i>

      Give the glory back.

    Give it all back to me.

    Give it all back to me.

    What I've done for you.

     What I do through you.

    Give it all back to me.

    Give it all back to me.

    Give it all back to me.

    What I've done for you.

     What I do through you.

    Give it all back to me.

<i> Give it all back.</i>

       Give it all back.

    What I've done for you.

     What I do through you.

    Give it all back to me.

<i> Give it all back.</i>

       Give it all back.

    What I've done for you.

     What I do through you.

        It is so clear.

  I am so clear and there's no
           going back.

            No more.

         I need truth.

Okay, and how exactly did you
        come to this

        sudden epiphany?

   I think it was my driftwood
             Jesus.

           Say what?

It's a long story but for the
       first time, in

a long time in my life it just
          felt true.

        True feels good.

     It feels really good.

And I don't know where this is
          gonna go.

  But I know I just have to go
            with it,

  whether it takes me there or
              not.

But it's not about the cheese,
          it's about

       the journey to it.

For everyone who asks receives
         and the one

who seeks finds, and to the one
         who knocks--

       it will be opened.

          Matthew-7-8.

           Wait, you?

   Right under your nose huh?

             What?

Pam I've known you for
 years and how did I

           miss that?

And why didn't you say anything
          through all

            of this?

    Oh no it's not my style.

    You don't wear a cross or
            anything?

      Really not my style.

              Huh.

But you seemed like you were so
          against the

      whole Mingle thing.

   I wasn't against anything.

I told you it was for
Christians looking for

       other Christians.

Who wanted to share a true love
          for Christ.

   And no matter what you may
        think, you're not

        quite there yet.

             Yeah.

  I've got a lot of work to do
              but,

        I want to do it.

       And not for Paul.

I mean, if he were a part
    of the deal that

         would be fine.

But, I want to do this for me.

I want a relationship with him.

   I, I want him in my life.

              Who?

              Him.

              Who?

              Him.

       I didn't hear you.

             Jesus.

I couldn't hear you, what'd you
             say?

  Ok I want Jesus in my life.

      There we go, I said.

     Can you say it louder?

    I want Jesus in my life!

         There you go.

      Hey it's Paul here.

   I'm back from old Mexico.

Leave me a message and I will
         get back to

              you.

          Knock knock.

            Oh wow!

      This is a surprise.

Let me catch up with you guys.

Do you want to come in here?

        That'd be great.

Knock knock you never said
       who's there.

       Okay, who's there?

            Heaven.

          Heaven who?

     Heaven you missed me?

             Cute.

    It's really dumb I know.

I really wanted to tell you I'm
            sorry.

I'm so sorry, for everything I
             did.

Lying to you and deceiving you
           which by

definition is the same thing.

           I'm sorry.

And I hope with all of my heart
         that you can

forgive me someday, no strings
          attached.

   I just wanted to say that.

        Gosh of course.

           Forgiven.

That is really thoughtful and,
           and very

             sweet.

        I appreciate it.

And I, also wanted to say thank
           you, for

        opening my eyes.

And my heart to all of this.

You woke something up in
    me that had just

been, I guess it had been there
          all along.

But I don't know, maybe
  that was his plan.

Maybe that's the reason we met.

         Nothing more.

             Right.

I don't know where it's going
        but, for the

first time I just, I have this
           sense of

      purpose in my life.

        That's awesome.

The heart of a man plans
    his way but the

  Lord establishes his steps.

Wow, you have been doing your
          homework.

          Yes I have.

   Do you mind us coming in?

    Oh Gwyneth, what a lovely
            surprise.

           Hi Gwinny.

              Hi.

   Gwyneth was just telling me
           about this

   amazing journey she's on.

              Oh?

       That's wonderful.

  Yeah, you know, it's kind of
            more of a

        weekend getaway.

Really I wouldn't actually call
         it a journey

              yet.

I'm just kind of cutting that
          baby path

through the jungle to Jesus,
         you know?

But just my, my sights are on
        the Lord, and

just yep that good ol' pathway
          to heaven.

          Right there.

    That's where I'm going.

             Okay.

              Bye.

      Gabby had her baby.

            Did she?

        Down in Mexico?

   Right there in the square.

Just like she wanted without a
            hitch.

That's awesome, and so public.

Yeah it's a beautiful, healthy
          baby boy.

          Praise God.

  Alright you look like you're
         chomping at the

bit to say something, so go on
         just say it.

You think you can handle it?

           We'll see.

             Okay.

On one hand I'm really
    happy for you.

    I am, just like I said.

But, on the other hand I'm kind
              of

    disappointed in you too.

      You're disappointed?

Okay look I know I messed up.

I wasn't truthful with you, and
          I am paying

      the price for that.

But, I'm kind of wondering what
             your

   deception is costing you.

             Kelly?

   If you're really happy, I'm
        happy, but isn't

   it just a little obvious?

  Actually I think it's pretty
         amazing that we

practically grew up together,
        and then one

day I turn around and there she
              is.

      It's like driftwood.

You're not your dad, you
   are not your mom.

You're you, and Kelly's a great
           girl and,

you know what, God is probably
          gonna like

   unload about 40 days and 40
         nights of rain

on me for saying all of this.

But, I just feel like you are,
         you play it

            so safe.

When does Paul get to just be
            Paul?

Like this church I've
   been going to.

Totally chill and laid back.

   Does that make it any less
         Christian than

       the one you go to?

         No, it can't.

But it does make it more me,
       and it doesn't

make it right or wrong but it's
           the way I

       can relate to God.

      Chill and laid back.

Not exactly how I would
 describe you, but go

             ahead.

I don't know if Kelly is
     on your path.

She may be, but it's like your
        life has been

planned and laid out for you,
         by everyone

            but you.

Just locked, stock and Jesus.

      It's your turn Paul.

       Take some chances.

Give safe a break, and be your
           own man.

          Just be you.

         You finished?

             Yeah.

  Yeah I guess, I guess I am.

             Good.

I don't think it's a good idea
         that we see

      each other anymore.

   I'll pray for you, I will.

But you are so off base here.

      Starting with Kelly.

No, I wasn't trying to be rude
         about Kelly.

You spend 5 minutes carving
     your way through

your jungle to Jesus, and you
       think that you

    have it all figured out.

I like you Gwyneth and I'm not
          gonna lie

     about that, and you are
       definitely one of a

kind, and I have no doubt
    of the incredible

    journey that you're on.

Or that Jesus is waiting
   for you with open

             arms.

             But I.

like I said, I'll pray for you
          but beyond

             that.

I was kidding about
the 40 days .

You don't even have a sense of
            humor.

   Okay that was wrong of me.

           I'm sorry.

        Please hear me.

I realized it wasn't enough to
          talk about

              God.

I needed to know God
personally .

So we started a conversation.

        Leave me alone!

            Really?

       You're so obvious.

            Really?

I remembered at my church the
          preacher

saying that Jesus died for my
         sin on the

  cross, and he told me if I'd
          turn from my

sin and ask Jesus into my life,
           he would

            come in.

   I know, a little heavy, but
         through all my

   tears that night I finally
         understood what

          that meant.

  Maybe you're knocking on one
           door hoping

       another will open.

I knocked on one more door, his
           door, and

        boy did it open.

    You're 3E right Hayden?

I've got your mail right here.

Dear Senorita, me sorry for my
         English not

            so good.

I want to say 'Hi and thank you
           very much

    for coming to San Luis'.

My village, it looks so pretty
        again, almost

      like it was before.

It is like what you
taught us in school.

   When bad things happened.

     God made us stronger.

   Just like you made our new
        church stronger.

I made a photograph of it for
            you.

       It look beautiful.

        It is beautiful.

  Sorry again for my English.

I hope you like the photograph.

     God bless you, Maria.

  I want to visit many places.

  I would like to see snow and
           make a snow

       angel from heaven.

I think the world is a
   beautiful place.

But the most beautiful is here
          because I

live here and it is my home.

And my family is here with me.

            The end.

   That was excellent, Maria.

And there is so much for
   you all to see and

do, and I'm sure you'll all get
         a chance to.

      Senorita, senorita!

    Es necesario que vay a la
        iglesia ahorita.

   English, please, Eduardo.

    And slow down por favor.

You need to go to the church.

      It's very important.

        You must go now.

         Hurry, hurry!

      Jose, llama para me.

      Did someone call me?

         No se, no se.

             I did.

             Paul?

   Wow, look at you, you look
             great!

    What are you doing here?

             Truth?

      I'm not really sure.

   If you're looking for Kelly
         she's not here

            with me.

       Not here or here.

    There only one thing more
         difficult than,

        playing it safe.

     You know what that is?

    Admitting you're wrong.

And I was so wrong to let you
        go, Gwyneth.

I came here to tell you that.

We get good cell service here.

I mean, a text message would've
             been

            cheaper.

  But you can't do this with a
              text.

So you maybe still
like me then ?

   Truth is I never stopped.

          Me neither.

I think we're being watched.

       Do you want to meet
            my kids?

   I like the sound of that.

            Come on.

  So your papa, I've gotten to
          know him on a

little on his visits down here.

And he is just an awesome guy.

And your momma, well,we're
     going to have to

     work on her a little.

  She's definitely an acquired
             taste.

   Speaking of which, I don't
         suppose we can

score some sushi around here?

       Don't even try it.

          You got me.

              Hi!

   You guys, wanna say 'hi' to
              Paul?

              Hey!

              Hey!

     Hey you wanna show him

            around?

      Show me the hamster!

             Yeah!

             Hello!

        The love of God

    and love is never blind.

  <i> You see all the wrongs I've</i>
         <i> tried to hide.</i>

<i> But you stay right by my side</i>
        <i> when all the</i>

        world does not.

<i> You're the one safe soul I've</i>
            <i> got.</i>

  <i> Man's greatest fear is being</i>
         <i> alone and his</i>

   You'll still love me when I
          start getting

    old and wrinkly, right?

   As long as you love me if I
           start going

          bald, right?

             Start?

            Really?

I used to think I knew it all.

   I had all the answers and I
        could spin a lie

     with the best of 'em.

Now I'm pretty sure I
 don't know anything

except Jesus is there for us.

All we have to do is call his
            name.

         And Mr. Right?

        He's there too.

You just have to reach into
      your heart and,

     discover what's true.
