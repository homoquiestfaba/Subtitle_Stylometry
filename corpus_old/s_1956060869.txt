You're having triplets.

Every family has a story.

You lost a child
and rolled out of my hospital

with three babies just the same.

They are heartwarming...
I love our life.

...and heartbreaking moments...

I need you to wake up!
The house is on fire!

My children lost their father
when they were 17.

...and relationships
that transcend time.

Big Three.
Big Three!

Big Three!
Big Three!

Big Three!

Tonight we celebrate
the Pearson family...

We all felt very early on that
we were part

of something special.

...and what they've meant
to audiences everywhere.

I met a woman on the street.

She said, "I adopted this baby
because of you."

We'll go behind the scenes
and back to the beginning

with neverbeforeseen
casting tapes...

Do you know how much
I love you?

Yeah, you've made
it very clear.

...and take a look forward

with an exclusive preview
from season 3.

Season 3.
Whoo!

Welcome to "The Paley Center
Salutes 'This Is Us."

First came...?
Me!

And Dad said...?
"Gee!"

And then came...?
Me!

And Mom said...?
"Whee!"

And then came...?
Me.

And we said...?

"That's three."
Big Three?

Big Three!
Big Three!

When I first read
the pilot script, it was

I knew right away this was
something that was special.

You don't get opportunities
like this.

I started writing "This Is Us"
as a film.

It was originally about seven
or eight kids all linked

by a birthday at 36 years old,

and I figured at the end
of the film you would reveal

that one of the couples
was their parents.

Only after putting it away
for quite a while

and the characters
kept sticking with me

I thought, "Huh, I wonder
if making it a television show

where I don't need to have
a beginning, a middle,

and an end but just
an continuous story of a family

would hold a little better?"

And so I kind of
picked it back up,

I shaved off four
or five of the characters,

and finished it out
as a television show.

My friend called me and said,
"Man, I just read this thing.

I think Dan Fogelman
just wrote you."

And I'm like,
"What are you talking about?"

So he sent it to me, and I read

I remember reading it,
and I thought, "That's me.

Oh, my God, he wrote me.
That's so cool.

That's so like me.
I'm Jack."

And then Uh, and then
I flipped a few more pages,

then I saw that I'm
I'm actually Kevin.

I love the script. I think
it's great very funny.

I've got no notes, no questions.

I was sort of at a point
in my career

where I had done pilot
after pilot after pilot

and nothing gained traction.

And it wasn't until I read
this script that, like,

something clicked in me
and I thought,

"I have to do whatever it takes
to be a part of this."

Did a series prior to this,
a show called "Mr. Robot,"

and I was like,
"Wow, I got a show

that I'm actually gonna be on
for a while," you know?

And I was killed off in the

the first episode
of the second season.

And I was just sad and bitter
and telling my friends,

"It's never gonna
happen for me."

There was a whole year
where nothing was happening.

I had 81 cents
in my bank account,

and I was gonna move
back home to Florida

to teach preschool again,

and this script came about,
and my really good friend

was like,
"You are this character.

Like, you have to read it."

I'm like, "Okay, yeah.

Like I'm gonna be reading
a pilot

and ever auditioning
for a pilot.

Like, are you k Dan Fogelman?
No. Not gonna happen."

We are a hot mess, huh?

Yeah.

Big Three?

Big Three.

The casting process was one
of those perfect dream scenarios

where I got to cast
everybody I wanted to cast.

I'm gonna need everyone
in this room to believe me

when I say that only good things
are gonna happen here today.

Actually, no I don't just
want you to believe it.

I want you to know it.

I read the scene,
and I could see Dan

in the back of the room
literally just, like, smiling.

I was thinking to myself,
"Okay, I think, uh

I think I must have
done my job."

[ Laughs ]

So, I'm gonna need everyone
in this room to believe me

when I say that only good things
are gonna happen here today.

Actually, II don't just
want you to believe it.

I want you to know it.

I remember going to the
audition, and, like,

the birds were birdier,
the sky was bluer.

I was like,
"The day is different!

It's gonna be amazing!"

I had a really nice time
tonight, Toby.

Thank you.

So, that's it?

Wait, what do you mean?

I mean, you're not gonna
invite me in

for a nightcap or anything?

[ Laughs ]

Cute.

And I get there and I'm like,
"Wha, wha, wha,"

and I see all the same girls,

and, you know, signed up,
and we're like, "Oh, hi!"

and we're all very kind
to each other,

but we're all like,
"We want a job.

We want this amazing job."

I had a really nice time
tonight, Toby.

Thank you.
Yeah.

Wait, what?
No, no, no.

What, that's it?

What do you mean?

I mean, you're not gonna
invite me in for a...

a nightcap or a handy
or something?

Cute.
I am. Thank you.

And I was still working on
"The People v. O.J."

at the time, and my
representation presented me

with this script, and I read it.

And I was reading it while I was
at the prosecution table,

like, in between takes.

I was like, "Who's this guy,
Dan Fogelman?"

I look him up
I was like, "Crazy Stupid Love"?

Like, that's my joint, right?

It was the best network
television pilot

that I had ever read.

I found him.

My father.

When?
Last week.

Last week?
And you didn't tell me?!

Don't be mad.
I'm mad!

Damn.
Yeah, damn.

Just before I got the show,
I remember thinking

that maybe it's time to do
something completely different,

so I was, um I was like,

gonna move to Montreal and,
like, work in a coffee shop,

and then "This Is Us" came along

literally, like,
a week or two alter.

I found him.

My father.

What? When?

I, uh, I hired a guy.

I went in very early
in the audition process.

I think I was one of the first
people that they read.

Hey.

How do you think we're doing

with parenting?

I think we're a 6, honestly.

On a sliding scale of 1 to 10,
I think we're at a 6,

and I think I'm being generous.

The feedback was
"They really liked you,

but now they're gonna go
and read a bunch of women

in New York
and across the country,

and we'll hopefully hear back
in a couple of weeks

once they've done that."

Hey, how do you think
we're doing so far?

At parenting?

I 'Cause I think we're at a 6.

On a sliding scale
of 1 through 10,

I think we're at a 6,

and I think I'm being generous.

About five or six weeks later,
we got a call

"Okay. They want to bring you
back in with a couple

of other women
and a couple of guys,

and they want to sort of
pair people up

and do what they call, like,
a 'chemistry read.'"

I got called in
to audition with Milo.

He was the only guy I read with,

and we sort of just instantly
had this connection.

Hey, kids.
Close your eyes in there.

Daddy's about to do
some terrible things to Mommy.

No.
No, no, no.

There's no way in hell, babe.
Mmhmm.

Yep.
Come on.

No.

It went well, and I guess
the rest is history

'cause we both got the job.

I don't know, birthday
tradition is birthday tradition,

so close your eyes
in there, kids,

because Daddy's about to do some
real terrible things to Mommy.

In any state in my life,
you arouse me.

I bet I can make that go away.

There's nothing
you can say that's

My water just broke.

Yep.
Yeah.

Coming up The first scene

that I ever shot
was half naked on a scale,

and I was like, "OOkay,
this is gonna be different."

Not only could you start
to see Milo as Jack,

but you couldn't possibly see
anyone else as Jack.

I think that was a pretty
magical hour of television.

And a very special sneak peek
from season 3

when "The Paley Center Salutes
'This Is Us'" returns.

.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

I found him.
My father.

My name is Randall Pearson.

I'm your biological son.

Toby.
Kate.

So, you want to be fat friends?

[ Laughs ]

The show is so bad!

Everything's fake!
I quit.

We lost the third baby, Jack.
I'm very sorry.

I like to think that you took
the sourest lemon

that life has to offer

and turned it into something
resembling lemonade.

Being on the pilot, I knew that

that this was a special group.

You know, there's the script,

but then you start seeing
the pieces assembled, you know?

Like, Mandy, Sterling,
and Justin,

and Chrissy,
and Sully, and Susan

Everything just starts
to round out.

I had to put the lingerie
on top of my clothes.

I see that.

It wasn't a great
moment for me.

Tradition is tradition.

You could start to see
Milo as Jack,

and then it quickly turned into

not only could you start
to see Milo as Jack,

but you couldn't possibly see
anyone else as Jack.

And I remember that happening
with every single character

as I would watch them.

We knew that, like, it had all
of the makings of something...

just undeniable.

Each character had something
that you could relate to,

but specifically for Randall
and that first time

that he meets William
and that monologue

that he lets out at him
and the turn of it.

I came here today so I could
look you in the eye,

say that to you, and then get
back in my fancyass car

and finally prove to myself
and to you and to my family

who loves me that I didn't need
a thing from you

even after I knew who you were.

You want to come in?
Okay.

But what he didn't realize once
he said, "You want to come in?"

and he was like "okay"

was that he was yearning
for this connection.

He was able to access
a part of himself

that he didn't
even know was missing.

It exposes people's
vulnerabilities and secrets.

I think that's what ends up
being the success of the show.

The first scene that I ever
shot was half naked on a scale,

and I was like, "OOkay,
this is gonna be different."

The thing that was so
extraordinary about the pilot

was that it it was a twist,
basically, at the end.

Someone left a newborn
at my fire station.

I didn't know what to do,
so I brought him here.

Season 1's twist is that
this show exists

in two different time periods.

It's such a hard show to market
because the very premise

of the show that all these
people are related

in different time periods
was a secret until the premiere.

So I remember feeling so bad
for our poor cast

who had to go do
all these talk shows

and all these events
where they weren't allowed

to say what the show was about.

Mandy and I were getting off
the plane in New York

for the upfronts, you know,

the big network presentation
to advertisers and all that.

Mandy turns around from her seat

and she says, "There's a trailer
that got released."

I'm like, "Oh, cool."

You know, I pull it up,
we both watch it,

we're both crying
just because it was doing that

to everyone, including us.

I remember being a cab.

The president of NBC texted me.

He's like,
"Something's happening

with the trailer right now,"

and by that afternoon
there were articles about

how it was breaking records
and all of this stuff.

I'm going to attribute it
to Milo's bare butt.

Like, I think that was just
people like seeing the bare butt

in the very beginning
and then just,

like, refreshing
and reloading to watch it again.

I think that's where
all the views came from.

One of the big concerns
when we started

was how was the audience
gonna track all of the time?

I remember feeling very strongly
that we needed to change

Milo's facial hair in order
to help orient the audience

so that it would be a marker
for the audience

to know exactly where they are

until they get comfortable
inside the show.

We wanted people to experience
those other periods

with the same kind
of emotional immediacy

that we experience the present.

And so we don't really
shoot them differently,

and we don't treat them
differently.

You have three actors in some
cases playing one character

through different times
of their life.

It's really cool to see

a younger version,
a teenage ver

There's so many facets
to those those ages.

And because the show's
not linear,

there's so much story to tell.

About three weeks before
we started shooting

the first season,
I got an email from Dan saying

"I have this crazy idea
where I really want you to try

and play Rebecca present day,

and we're gonna get the best,
like, special effects makeup

and wigs and all of that.

And if even one person
has, like, an inkling

of where they don't buy it,

then we'll, you know,
we'll forgo that, and we'll

we'll do some incredible casting
and find, you know,

an older actress
to play you in those years."

I get to play this woman
from 22 to 68, um,

at every different facet
of her life.

It is fascinating.

It's never not challenging.

I get a call saying

"We've got to send you to
the Valley to do a makeup test."

I said, "Okay, you're gonna be
here for about two hours.

We're gonna do a lifecast."

A lifecast is where they mold
your entire head and shoulders

and they take a mold of you,

and then they build things
on to your face,

and I didn't understand
why I was gonna need that,

and I was asking
the makeup guys,

"Why are you doing a lifecast?"

And they said,
"We're gonna be aging you to,

you know,
70 or something like that."

"What? Why?"

"Well, because, you know,

present day
you're married to Rebecca."

"What?! I'm married to Rebecca?
I thought that was Jack's wife?"

And I got I went through
this whole thing

with the makeup artists, and
and that's how I found out.

Come to us.
When we return...

Come to us.
Surprising amounts of laughter

on a show where the narrative
is that everybody's

always crying all the time.

This family, if you
can zoom in there,

is actually watching our show.

We're filming next door.
We're gonna go

We're gonna go knock
on their door.

Come on.

When "The Paley Center Salutes
'This Is Us'" continues.

.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Hey, guys.
I'm Milo.

We're gonna read
a couple tweets from fans.

"Don't date a girl
that's watched

'This Is Us' because
nothing you ever do

will even slightly compare
to Jack Pearson,

and you'll never be
worthy enough."

No, don't actually
listen to this person.

Watch "This Is Us,"
learn some lessons,

and maybe be inspired by Jack
and how he lives his life

and how he loves his wife,
and be a Jack in real life,

'cause I'm only Jack
for pretend on TV.

"To millions of women
everywhere, who will forever cry

when they see a Mars bar"
myself included.

But I have to be honest,

you're doing a scene
like that so many times.

It would be a lot
of candy bars to eat,

and I probably would have gotten
an upset stomach,

so every time we did a take,

somebody came up with
a trash can

so I could spit it out.

But I still am sad
when I see a Mars bar, too.

"Oh, my! Kevin from
'This Is Us, '

the hot sibling"

That's not true.
We're all hot.

"Is working out, like,
20 feet from me.

I'm about to scream."

You should have screamed.

Scream next time.

"I love all of your outfits.

I wish we were sisters
that shared clothes."

Girl, where do you live?

I'll send you some clothes.
I have many clothes to share.

And, listen, thank God that
there are clothes for us girls

because for a long time,
there wasn't.

And I'll send you some clothes.

I'm not kidding.

"If anyone out there shares
the same exact

personality traits
as Randall in 'This Is Us, '

send me a direct message.

I want to love and cherish you"

[ Laughs ]

I'll say this to you

You got good taste
because Randall's a good man.

I am not Randall.

I am not as good of a man
as Randall,

but he makes me want
to be a better person.

So if you do find him,
God bless you.

You found yourself a good one.

Ready?
And action!

Good morning.
Morning.

She's right outside.

Cracking an episode
of this show

and getting it from idea to TV
is quite a process.

It takes a couple of months.

It starts with all of us in the
writers' room brainstorming

you know, "What's this episode
gonna be about?"

We have very sort of, you know,
diverse writers' room.

It's really important to us
to have, you know,

people of different races,

people with kids,
people of different ages

so that one person sort of
doesn't have to bear the load

of having the perspective
of every single character

at every single moment.

You come in almost at
the top of the scene.

As a director, one of my
responsibilities

is to assess what the goals
of the script are,

what the writers' intentions
are, and then tell that story.

I think people should start
back there

so that I see them
as they make that turn.

So it's seen this way.
Sure.

I also try to create
an environment

where this cast can do
their best work.

It's a great collaboration,
I think, between us all.

And we're all really connected.

I try and, like,
keep an open door for the actors

to come into the writers' room.

They do like coming and hanging,
and they offer ideas,

and it often gets
put into the show.

Mandy and I were
in the writers' room

just kind of hearing about new
stories for the second season,

and the story line
for Justin, for Kevin,

where, you know, he's gonna be
working with his movie idol

who happens to be his father's
hero, and they're like,

"Well, who we really want
is Sylvester Stallone."

And then they're all just
kind of staring at me, and I go,

"Oh, you want me to call him.
Okay.

Yeah.
Yeah, I'll call him."

Sly and I had worked together
14 almost 15 years ago.

Every time I would see him,
he would always say to me,

"If you need anything, call."

And I thought, "Okay, well, this
is a little better than a need.

This is just,
'Do you want to join us?'

I'm on a movie set saving
Sylvester Stallone's life.

[ Imitating Sylvester Stallone ]
"Every champion was once

a contender who refused
to give up, you know?"

Not so bad. [ Chuckles ]

[ Normal voice ] Oh.
Oh, lord.

Uh, Mr. Stallone, how are you?

The cast is a part
of the creative process,

not just because
they're pretty people

who say the words on camera,
but they're part of all of it.

When we saw the episode
coming up called

"The New Big Three,"
and we were like, "Wow.

Like, ddid the writers
hear us talking?"

To the, uh
to the new Big Three.

Part of that came together
with the three of us

asking for scenes together.

[ Laughs ]

We wanted to work together.

It's not necessarily a given
that Toby and, uh,

Miguel and Beth would end up
in the same room together.

Toby.
Yeah, Beth?

We're day drinking
on Family Day

from Kevin's rehab place.

I know. It's like
an Alanis Morissette lyric.

'Cause it's ironic.

Surprising amounts of laughter
on a show where the narrative

is that everybody's
always crying all the time.

Come here.
Come here.

Come to us.
Come to us.

Come to us.

We're often shooting
in neighborhoods,

and we were shooting
in a neighborhood

and through the window, like,
a house across the street,

Milo could see a family

watching our television show
live that same night.

So, this family,
if you can zoom in there,

is actually watching our show.

We're filming next door.

We're gonna go We're gonna
go knock on their door.

Come on!

Hi.
Sorry to bother you.

Hi.
We, uh

We're filming next door,
but we happened to notice

what you're watching right now.

[ Laughter ]

You're watching us.
Yes, I'm watching you guys.

So, we're filming this
right next door.

Yeah, that's great. I
What's your name?

Fred.
Fred, Milo.

Wait, Zoe, come here.

Fred is watching right now.

Look it There's Sterling,
there's Mandy, there's Susan.

Amazing.
Okay, Fred, enjoy!

Coming up
Mrs. Pearson,

your husband has died.

That was the very,
very most emotional thing

I think I've done on the show.

I think that was a pretty
magical hour of television.

You're good.

And a very special
sneak peek from season 3

when "The Paley Center Salutes
'This Is Us'" returns.

.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Your mom and I, we're not gonna
be around forever,

and when we're gone the two of
you and your sister

are the only people who are
gonna be able to look back

and remember all the stuff
that's happened to you.

This cancer is coming for me
sooner than later.

Do you want to stop
the chemo, William?

I watch the Steelers,
and I watch them with my dad.

He sounds like a cool guy.
I'd like to meet him sometime.

And I know it's gonna be
a little creepy.

This is your dad?

One week ago
you had a breakdown.

My father doesn't have a lot
of time left,

and he'd very much like
to show me where he's from.

The "Memphis" episode was...

II think that was pretty
magical hour of television.

Dan handled us a script,
and he goes,

"I think it's the best thing
I've ever written."

[ Chuckles ] And we're like,
"Well, we better

make it the best thing
we ever directed, then."

We decided to actually shoot
Ron Cephas Jones'

William's death at the beginning
of the schedule

so we could kind of
get it over with

so we could all kind of,
like, put that away,

and then remind ourselves that,

you know, we're gonna
see him going forward.

What I love about the episode
is up until the end

if was really like a buddy

It was like a road trip,
you know what I'm saying?

Like, they had a great time.

I hope the ducks are still
at The Peabody.

My uncle used to work there
as a bellman

when it was segregated,
and he would sneak me in.

Hmm.

And I sure would like you
to see those ducks.

We were very loose shooting
for that show.

We were kind of running
and gunning, like, you know,

just camera on shoulders and

and, like, running around
and grabbing little things.

It was a lot of montages.

And so we came to Sterling
and Ron, and we said,

"There's an old segregated
water fountain.

Do you want to do something?"
Just an improv scene.

I mean, is it inappropriate
for us to even ask you that?

They're like, "No!
God, that's great."

This is the original water
foundation that they

kept here
for its history lesson.

That was white,
and this was black.

You know what?

I've been living with
white people for a long time.

Oh, my God,
you're in trouble now, son.

Ah.

It was a moment for William
to teach Randall

about some of his own history
that he may have been

removed from, and Randall
reveling in the fact

that he's sharing
this special moment

with his biological father.

William?

It's okay.

It's okay. I'm gonna get you
to the hospital, okay?

We don't expect it to end
the way that it's going to end.

So when William all of sudden
becomes sick, you know,

you see this young man
who wasn't quite sure

whether or not he wanted to let
this individual into his life

and now having opened up
his heart had let him in fully,

now have to say goodbye.

The two best things in my life

were the person
in the very beginning

and the person at the very end.

That's a pretty good thing
to be able to say, I think.

I think so, too.

"Memphis" had a lot of...

...a lot of depth for me.

And I was able to just transfer
it right into the character,

and William carried that
right through that episode, man,

all the way until the end.

I'm a little scared.

[ Sighs ]

[ Sniffles ]

[ Coughs ]

You're okay, Dad.

You're good.

I lost my father when I was
10 years old, um,

and I wasn't allowed to be
at the hospital to say goodbye.

My family thought
I was too young.

So there's something deeply
cathartic about being able

to say goodbye to my dad.

You know, it was a perfect
sort of symbiosis, if you will,

of Sterling in Randall,
you know, of William and my dad

sort of, like, you know,
laid in on top of one another.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

The very, very most
emotional thing

I think I've done on the show
is, um, you know, the

the pressure and the expectation

that came along
with figuring out

and learning
how Jack passed away.

The moment that
that fire started,

I mean, the Internet
just exploded.

Aah!

From the second Jack opens
his eyes and there's the smoke,

it was safety first,
second, and third.

You take that mother
out that window

if I'm not back
in three minutes.

Jack!
Uh, if she won't go

If she won't go out,
you drag her out.

I love you.

Baby girl, I'm coming for you!

Oh, yeah. Thanks.
The floor is slippery.

Yeah It's just

I think it's the probably
the fire department's.

Then it was just
beat by beat making sure

we had everything to build
the story of Jack

responding to the situation and
getting his family to safety.

Towel goes under the door
the second it closes.

If I'm not back
in three minutes,

you take your mother
out that window.

If she won't go,
you drag her out.

Dad Hey.

I love you.

That was completely controlled
and completely safe,

but, still, it was a big,
real scary fire.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

[ Dog barking ]

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

I don't know if I've ever been
guiltier, as a director,

than working
with Mandy on that show

because every scene she had
was utterly devastating.

Like like, the one
happy scene she had was

when she was deluded and thought
Jack was still alive.

One of the complications
of smoke inhalation

is that it puts
a terrible stress on the lungs.

I'm afraid we've lost him.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Mrs. Pearson,
your husband has died.

Super Bowl episode,
candy bar moment

of Rebecca biting the candy bar
as the doctor's explaining

to her what happened to
her husband and the disbelief.

I was just like
And she just takes that bite.

I think that's one of the great
acting moments that, like

It's, like, my favorite thing.

Are you out of your mind?

No, Mrs. Pearson.
Okay.

I think you're mistaking me.

I just need to No, no.

Can you Can you just
Can you back up?

We had been carrying around
this secret

for almost two years,

and I wanted to make sure
that I, as an actor,

was able to deliver.

"Okay, you're gonna come in,

the cameras are gonna be
pointing at you,

and you're gonna see
Jack off camera."

Babe?

You w Jack.

And she thought it was
gonna be an empty bed

and she was gonna be
acting to nothing.

We put Milo in the bed
to surprise her,

and, I mean, it really shows.

Jack.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

It was sad,
but at the same time

I was happy to get past
that story in the second season

so that we could
kind of get back

to the life of the man
and understanding

the things that made this this
amazing patriarch of the family.

When we return...

It's always gonna be

about the weight for me, Toby.

Oh! I might
get a little teary.

I met a woman on the street.

She said, "I adopted this baby
because of you,"

and I was like...

When "The Paley Center Salutes
'This Is Us'" continues.

.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

No more drinking.

You can't just stop.
I can.

For you, I can.

I'm trying to be strong here
'cause that's the gig,

but it happened to me, too.

You always got
special treatment.

Because I'm black?
No, because you're black

and you're adopted.

Oh, yeah, hit the jackpot
with that combination.

Couldn't have had it any easier.

In our house, you did.
I've got to get a handle

on myself, on the weight
and on all of it.

I'm not sure you've ever
experienced anything real

your entire life.

I don't think we're taught
how to feel,

and if we are,
it's so uncomfortable

that it's hard
to move through it,

and so that's what is
so beautiful

about the writing in the show,
is that it's not

what happens to you,
but how you react to it.

The breakthrough
on the show was

the first week I gathered
our very talented writers,

saying, "Oh, no, this isn't
a soap opera.

This is what is happening
in every single person's life."

The human experience is shaped
by love and loss and joy

and hopes and dreams
and failure, and it makes

all of our lives feel bigger,
I think, and more important

because of the way
the actors play these things

and the you invest
in this family.

We have the type of fans
that are sort of quick

to share their personal stories

and to tell you what particular
story line related to them

and moved them
and impacted their life.

My son is adopted, and he looks
different than my husband and I,

and it's just
It's so nice to have a show

to watch that adoption is
a huge part of the story line.

So, we like
watching this family.

'Cause this is us.

I met a woman on the street.

She said, "Your show
and your story line

made me realize that
there's something that I can do

with my life that I need to do.

And so I adopted this baby
because of you."

And I was like...
That's the first time

anybody's ever told me
that before, right?

You're adopted, and we don't
talk about that enough,

'cause to me, you are
every part my son.

My mother adopted my youngest
brother and sister

who are now 20 and 18 years old,

so it was a story line that was
near and dear to my heart

because I've witnessed firsthand
how love can transform lives.

He wants to adopt a little boy
because he was a little boy

when he was adopted.
Yeah.

I mean, I guess
that's part of it.

He wants to honor
his two fathers

by replicating the exact
same situation he had.

I don't know if I would put it

Hey, Mary, let me ask you
you have any kids laying around

that were left
at a fire station?

'Cause that might really scratch
my husband's itch.

I really dug when they said
that we were going to foster

and it was gonna be
an older kid.

I just thought, "Wow, that's
so not neat and pretty

and tied up with a little bow,
and it's just perfect."

Randall, if we're
really gonna do this,

let's take in an older kid

who no one else in the whole
damn world is gonna help.

All the writers
and, of course, Dan

have been so diligent
about being authentic

in whatever any of
these characters plights are.

I think addiction in particular
is something

of course a through line
through the Pearsons,

whether it's alcohol
with Jack or pills or food.

We're all trying to fill a void
with something.

You don't know
everything about me.

Yes, I do.

I know everything about
No, Rebecca, you don't.

I'm drunk right now.

I have been drunk all day.

I have been drunk for weeks.

"This Is Us" is special to me
because of Jack Pearson.

While he does have his vices
we all do,

in some capacity or another
but he takes

he takes those problems
and issues head on

and shows what it means
to be a man in those situations,

and I just hope to be
the kind of man Jack Pearson is.

I think Rebecca is a fierce
supporter and partner

when it comes
to facing Jack's addiction.

I think she sees the thread
in both of her children.

We're a family of addicts.

Okay.

We're not a family
of addicts, Kev.

Our father was an addict, Kate.

His father was an addict.
I'm an addict.

I think the addiction thing
just came from all the pain

and just keeping
everything inside

and never talking about
his father's death.

Kevin Pearson will walk again

just in time to bury
his beloved father.

That'll keep him down
for good this time, right?

When he's on the football field
and sort of recounting his life

and how people
perceive him versus

how he's actually experiencing
life in his own skin

I thought Justin laid that out.

And he tries so hard
to be strong,

and he needs painkillers
to get through it.

And even when he tries to tell
people how pathetic he is,

they just...

They don't hear it.

They just cheer.

When I saw Kevin,
I didn't see him as this guy

that had the world on a string.

I saw him as a guy
in a crowded room

with everyone staring at him

and just being totally
and completely alone.

The first time I ever showed
the cast

the television show,
we went over to our director,

Glenn Ficarra's, house
to screen them the pilot.

And I was like, "Chrissy, like,

I don't know what's going
to happen to the show,

but I know that people
are going to attach

to this character
and your performance."

I knew in an instant when I was
introduced to Kate Pearson

that she was my character.

We both struggled with weight,
so watching her story line

is like I'm watching
myself on TV.

It's always gonna be about
the weight for me, Toby.

It's been my story ever since
I was a little girl.

And every moment that I'm not
thinking about it,

I'm thinking about it.

[ Sighs ]

Oh! I might get
a little teary.

There was a woman who said that
"My son has an eating disorder,

and we're going to an eating
disorder clinic right now,

but what you've done for him
and what you've done for

for kids and all sorts of people
to really accept yourself

for who you are to get
to the place you want to be

is just incredible."

And that was like...

'Cause that's all we all want,
is, like,

to be able to be ourselves
but be loved for that.

The reason why "This Is Us"
is so special to me

is because I lost my father.

I relate to Kate's character
because I stayed the night

with my parents the night
before he passed away,

and if I hadn't had been there,
if me and my boyfriend

now husband at the time
had not been fighting,

I wouldn't have parked
behind his truck,

um, he wouldn't have taken
his motorcycle,

and he would still be here.

So I blame myself

You remember when I told you

I couldn't talk about
my dad's death.

Yeah, of course.

Well, that's because
it's my fault.

Mmhmm.

I'm the reason that he's dead.

If this show is making you cry,
then maybe maybe it's

maybe that you need
to call somebody

or maybe you need
to apologize to somebody,

or maybe you need to talk
to your mom more,

or maybe you need
to forgive your brother.

I was not a very good brother
to you, was I?

No, you weren't.

But you still got time.

Coming up, a special preview
of season 3...

My name's Jack.

[ Laughs ]

...when the "The Paley Center
Salutes 'This Is Us'" returns.

.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

I want my kids to be okay.
I want my family to be okay.

We're perfect, Beth.

You made one of the sweetest
damn pitchers

of lemonade I ever saw.

Season 3 of "This Is Us"
has officially begun.

[ Sighs ]
We're so grateful to be

I am so grateful to be back...

It is so wonderful.
...with you.

I'm so glad to see you.

I'm so excited
to be back to set.

Season 3 is gonna be amazing.

You're gonna be crying,

and I'm gonna be so happy
that you're crying.

Season 3.

Whoo!
Ooh.

The first episode this year

is probably my favorite

episode I've done.

We're going places
with these characters

and diving deep
into their back stories.

Our Big Three are sort of
all embarking

on really new life situations.

We're gonna see Randall

in a really exciting
professional situation,

Kate and Toby sort of
continuing they're newlyweds,

and they're still trying
to have a family.

Obviously, Kevin is sort of
very into figuring out

exactly what happened
in his dad's past,

so it's a really exciting time.

You see Jack in Vietnam,
you see Jack and Rebecca

as their love is developing.

I'm excited to travel back
to the beginning of

Jack and Rebecca's
courtship in season 3.

It's so much even more
emotional to just go back

to a period in the 1980s

when he's alive
'cause everything is loaded.

You know how borrowed
his time is.

As you can see,
we're in full effect

perhaps in the '70s.

We're gonna cry and laugh
and do all the things

that you're familiar
with us doing.

We've got social media now,
so you get to

You get to read how people
don't like your character

which sometimes
they can't separate you

from your character.

"I hate you, Miguel!"

My name's actually Jon,
not Miguel, um,

but I understand how you might
feel about the character,

and we're gonna
we're gonna fix that, trust me.

At the end of season 2
we see Toby in bed,

fairly paralyzed from

from what appears to be
some kind of depression.

I just spoke to the doctor.

He wants you
to come in tomorrow,

talk about adjusting your meds.

We've seen a pretty joyful
and exuberant and up Toby

for two seasons,
and so I think come season 3,

you're going to see the balance.

You're gonna see
the other side of that.

I'm so excited to be back on
to season 3 of "This Is Us"

because what a great way
to just spend your summer,

and I've never seen everyone in
a while, so I'm so happy.

Stay tuned lots of exciting
stuff coming up.

I'll tell you what, man,
I got the best job

on television.

Good vibes all the way around,

wonderful stories,
wonderful people.

What I enjoy about the show
and the direction

that we're taking this year
is that we're not afraid

to illuminate
an authentic marriage.

They hit some snags,
and we get a chance to witness

that happen with
Beth and Randall

throughout the course
of season 3.

I have a new film that opens up
called "Life Itself."

Life is never one thing.

It's not a comedy,
it's not a tragedy,

it's not a drama,
it's not an action movie.

It's a bunch of different things
all at once,

and I think that's what
I'm trying to do with this film

and what I'm trying to do
with the show.

It's kind of where I live.

I'm loath to say it because
you're supposed to undersell

and then, like, let people
be pleasantly surprised

as opposed to letting people
be disappointed.

But I think this is gonna be
our best season so far.

It's definitely
our most ambitious.

And now an exclusive preview
from season 3.

My mother says
at a certain point

I have to get realistic
about my life, but I just

I don't know if I agree
with that, you know what I mean?

Because I'm a singer.

Wow.
I said that out loud.

I'm a singer.
I'm a singer.

[ Laughs ]

I have been sending my demo off,
and I have this dream of signing

with Reprise Records
out in Los Angeles.

They're the ones who put out,
uh, the last

Joni Mitchell album, "Blue."

Oh.
I'm sorry.

I feel like I'm talking
too much.

Am I talking too much?

'Cause I feel like
I'm talking too much.

Please tell me
something about you.

Well, my name's Jack.

[ Laughs ]

Okay. That's a good
place to start, Jack.

Do you...

Do you maybe want
to get out of here?

I don't mean that the way
that it sounded.

I just The food here is

Yeah. No. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, no, let's

Okay, great.
I'm gonna go get my jacket.

All right.
I'll meet you outside.

Okay.

[ Car horn honks ]

Jesus.

What the hell happened, man?

I met the girl.

You met a girl while
No, no, no, no the girl.

Can't wait for you all to see
what we got in store

for you come September.

All right, well,
we'll talk to you soon.

Bye!
Bye!

Just when you thought more
couldn't happen, it does, okay,

'cause "This Is Us."
