Subtitle: Bogsee23 vs. Vercsike

Once man and those
in the water were linked.

They inspired us,
they spoke of the future.

Man listened and it became real.

But man does not listen very well.

Man's need to own everything

led him deeper into land.

The magic world of the ones
that live in the ocean

and the world of man
separated.

Through the centuries their world
and all the inhabitants of it

stopped trying.

World of man
became more violent.

War upon war played out

as there were no guides
to listen to.

Now…
Those in the water are trying again.

Trying to reach us.

A handful of their precious young ones
have been sent into the world of man.

They're brought in the dead of night

to where man lives.

They need only be glimpsed

and the awakening of man will happen.

But their enemies roam the land.

There are laws that are
meant to keep the young ones safe

but they are sent to
a great risk to their lives,

many do not return.

Yet still they try,

try to help man

but man may have forgotten

how to listen…

My daughter says to be careful, Mr. Heep!

Uuh... Well, it's some kind of a b.. bug.

It's very big!

It's very hairy!

…el es una criatura de el Diablo!

My other daughter says it's
some kind of creature the Devil made.

Tell her it's not a creature.

There's no such thing
as creatures, all right?

You might wanna turn away!

Sorry this is taking so long!

It's over, It's over!

It's safe.

My daughter says thank you
for protecting them.

Mr. Farber! I'm Cleveland Heep.
Welcome to The Cove!

Mr. Heep!

Are you the new tenant?

Uh.. ya! This is Mr. Farber,
he is in 13B,

and Mr. Farber, this is Young-Soon Choi.

She lives with her mother at 8A.

She is a student at the university.

Young-Soon,

you don't know
who has been swimming in the pool

the last few nights, do you?

No, Mr. Heep.

Oh, by the way,
thanks, I liked it!

You're welcome!

Mr. Heep loves learning.

He doesn't want people to know.

Mr Heep!
Pool man looking for you!

I tell him you come soon.

Could you wait here
just a moment, please?

Could I ask you something,
you answer me straight?

Have you guys been
having parties in here?

Bubble parties, bubble bath,
everyone goes in skinny dipping?

No.

'Cause bubbles make the water very slick.

No.

I trust you on that.

But something is making
this water like this.

There has been

someone swimmimg at night time,

I hear s.. splashing some nights.

When I left yesterday
afternoon this filter was empty.

You're kinda little flat, mate. You
could workout a little bit, right?

I can give you all vain like that,

I can make you look just like this.

Right?

Those people say:

Hey, what's wrong with you Reggie,

why you only working out
on one side of your body?

Tell 'em it's like an experiment.

I'm like a scientist.

This morning
I measured my bicep.

1,5 inches difference from
one side to the other.

Take a guess at the
difference between my thighs.

Well, Reggie...

Hey!

Hey. It's all right.

Me and the new guy...

we're talking science.

OK, that's great!

Here we go, Mr.

Here we go! Come on.

Don't hang out in the
stairway Reggie, please!

-OK.
-All right.

People might... trap.

All right.

Reggie is one of us.

He just wants to be special.

He is working out only
one side of his body.

Did he.. did he tell you that?

Hello Mr. Leeds.

He's been here.. forever.

Mrs. Bell,
she takes any animals.

Smart lady.
You'd like her.

… a bunch of people better then he is.

Name four people better then he is!

...Lenny, Axel Rose,
Brett Michael is better than he is,
John Bon Jovi …

This is you.

Theres no smoking inside,

and theres no swimming after seven.

I hope It's OK to ask.

What brings you out here from
the west coast, Mr. Farber?

I've been hired to be the local film and
book critics at the paper.

Did they flew you all
the way out here from there?

They did.

Oh you must be very... God!

Mr. Heep, Mary Pen again.

I smell something awful coming
form the upstairs appartment.

I think someone may have died,

and the body is decomposing.

I know I said this last week but…

Wow, I saw you!

I saw you!

Come out of that pool right now!

Hey!

I'm gonna wait!

Hey!

Hey!

Come on out now! This...

It's not safe!

Come on out!
This is not...

This is not funny!

Please stop!

Is this you pull me out?

Where are you from?

Blue World.

Is that an apartment?

Do you feel an awakening?

I'm sorry?

You feel like pins and needles inside?

It is not you.

It's late.

You really... shouldn't be here.

Im kinda old fashioned that way.

I don't even know your name.

My name is Story.

I didn't mean for you to tell.

Why am I not stuttering?

What?

All right Story, my name is Cleveland.

From the cliffs.

That's what your name means.

From where do you know that?

From my studies.

I promise that I will not
get you into trouble.

You can go.

I am scared.

I will wait here with you Cleveland.

Why are you scared?

You can wait here,

for a little bit,
until you feel not so scared.

Are you OK?

Oh my God! It's just a kid.

Hello!

It's time to go,

Story.

OK, I think you need some fresh air.

I'm just gonna take you outside,

and I'm gonna put you one of the poochairs,

then I'll get you some coffe,

then you can wake up,

then I'll walk you home.

Tell me who the world are you anyway?

Narf.

What?

Ok.

Come on.

Here we go.

... sort of hairy,

but matter like clumps.

You know... and it was kind of green.

Was it green?

Ya, I thought so.

Matter is not right,

it was flat and

thicker than hair,

like this, like this!

Flat and this kind of a color.

Is this not helping you at all?

Forget about its hair for a second.

It's obviously some dumb animal who

muddied himself.

No!

Was it a Great Dane?

No, no, no Sir.

Are there wolves in this area, hyenas?

Hey Jack, this is Philadelphia,
where do you think you're living?

Sorry, something keeps
setting up the sprinklers.

I'm look around the forest
and check behind the dumpsters and stuff

An animal the size that you're describing,

doesn't just walk around 'n not be seen.

There's nowhere for a
dumb big animal to hide.

Hey.

Got a lot of homework, right?

University gave us many pages of reading.

What they think, I have no social life?

I got more books for you.

Could you look up the word NARF for me?

It's an eastern bedtime story, Mr. Heep.

I do not remember it, my great

grandmother used to tell it
when she was alive.

Bedtime story?

What's the story?

I don't know remember.

How about your mother?

Hello, Mrs. Choi, hello.

She wants to know
who told you this word.

Oh just a friend...
I don't know her very well.

She said that her grandmother

used to tell this story

like a prayer, like it was true.

She said she knew someone,
who knew someone,

who saw one.

Saw one what?

A Narf.

The bedtime story says is a sea nimph.

What happens in the story, please?

In the bedtime story,

she must be seen by the one
human chosen for her.

This person is called the Versol.

Seeing the Narf awaken
something important.

If she is successful in this,

she will return with
the Great Eatlon, a giant eagle,

and become free.

She won't tell me more.

She said why can't I be
like my older sister

she married a dentist.

Story!

Story!

Cleaveland!

Story, could you
put something back on?

Are you here to meet someone
or see someone in this building?

Is somebody supposed to see you?

This...

It is a writer.

Do you know his name?

Do you know what it looks like?

Dou you know if it's a woman or a man?

Is this something that
you wanna tell me?

Is this person writing
something important?

When do you have to leave?

I can leave tonight

if I meet this person.

I wanna help you to get home.

Thank you Cleveland!

I have to go.

Hello, I.. I wanted to ask you
something about your work...

... your critic work.

How.. How's it going?

I'm seeing a romance film tonight.

Not my cup of tee.

So you.. you haven't
written anything yet?

No, I haven't written
anything for some time.

You were right about that one tenant.

I spoke with Mrs. Bell,

we got along.

She's very good with animals.

You know she wrote a book?

Mr. Heep I will be taking the cat in direct.

Don't worry Mrs. Bell.

Oh.. look at you.

There's a lot of butterflies
around this building.

Strange behavior for them.

They are not usually so trusty.

I understand that you're a writer Mrs. Bell.

Now where do you hear such things?

Maybe I read your book.

That'd be quite a trick, it's been
out of stock for twenty years.

Twenty years?

So haven't written anything recently?

Mr. Farber has been speaking out of term.

Look at this cereal caracter's picture, Dad.

It looks just like aunt Sophie's eyes

when she found that everybody
hated her fruit board painting.

Nine-letter word for inhuman form.

You'll figure out, Dad.

You know the color on this box is
just like the colors of your car dad.

Maybe we should take your car
and go visit aunt Sylvia.

Incarnets.

Well, you're very good with those
word puzzles, Mr. Dury?

U-huh, he's at grand master level.

I'm gonna be just like him.

So you like words a lot, huh?

I adore them.

Are you...
are you writing anything, Mr. Dury?

A book, maybe?

No, I'm affraid my skills are
limited to cross-word puzzles.

There's some serious weakage man.

You don't even speak English anymore.

What? Weakage?

Damn straight it's English:
the state of weak.

There's no weakage man!

Some smoker just like us made it up

somewhere here you are speak it.

Let's make up a winning phrase!

And it will become famous.

Needs to be on some T-shirt

or something, you ass.

No, it doesn't!

It just catches up,

people just start saying it.

Blim-blam.

What?

Plim-plam?

Somebody already said that.

Gentlemen... I.. uh

I don't suppose that you have written
anything lately?

An essay or something?

Something important?

No essays here, my man.

Ok. Stop putting your clothes
in the garbage disposal,

and stop smoking!

Baby's on the half tip!

There you go!

Mr. Heep!

She told me a little bit more of the story

before she threw a coushion at me.

Young-Soon!

You're not writing anything, are you?

P..Paper maybe?

Writing?
No, Mr. Heep!

This semester all multiple choice courses.

Young-Soon is not stupid.

She told me about a bad guy in the story.

These creatures are called Scrunts.

They're ment to kill a Narf
when she's out of the water.

They can lay completley flat.

Their back is covered in grass.

My great grandmother said
that's why man never sees them.

They appeal as a bump in the thorns.

Vick, Anna!

Mr. Heep the lighter on my
desk is still not working.

I promise I'll get to it.

How is the writing?

Slow.

Are you tired Mr. Heep?

How long have you been writing that?

Six months.

What?

I should finish, right?

He just... it just sits on his desk.

My brother's scared.

He'll do anything to get out of writing.

See this?

It's the third load of loundry

he has done this week.

I can fix that light now, if you want.

A cook book.

This is kind of...

silly.

That's not how you fold.

Mr. Heep tell her to stop annoying me.

I fixed the light.

I'll make you dinner Mr. Heep.
Thank you!

You both cooks?

Who? Him?

He can't cook.
He is banned from the kitchen.

I don't understand something.
I'm sorry. My ladder...

I accidentally bumped into your desk,

I ended up seeing the title of

what it is you writing

is not a cook book?

I know it's a bad title, all right?

It's actually ... it's just my thoughts
and all the cultural problems and

thoughts on leaders and stuff.

I dont know who's gonna want
publish that thing.

That is not how you fold.

Your thoughts are very sad.

Most are of one night.

A night a man entered your home
and you were not there.

He stole many things and
killed your wife and children.

That is when you stopped being happy.

You were a doctor!

I am very sorry for you.

You believe you have no purpose.

You help all that live here.

Anybody could do this job, Story.

You have a purpose.

All beings have a purpose.

I know who you are.

And I think that I found your Versol.

You know what I'm talking about, right?

He's outside.
Do you need to see him alone,

or does he just need to see you?

Cover yourself up.

Hey!

Mr. Heep I know I signed that format.

I gave it to you on the stairs.

Ok.

My sister is all angry at me now.

Well, I check again.

By the way, this is my friend, Story.

Hi!

Yeah, you were right, here it is!

Great!

You all right?

You look a little...

I'm feeling fine, it's nothing.

Is it pins and needles kind of feeling?

Yeah, kind of.

Yeah!

Maybe you should go lie down.

Nice meeting you.

I'm so very happy we saw each other.

You don't have to leave
right now, do you?

I'll have to finish a couple
of things, and I'll be back.

Is that Ok?

Your words are very beautiful.

Your heart is very big.

Noone knows about my family here.

Please, do not bring it up again!

Comin'!

Sorry I'm late Mrs. Bobchuck,

it's been a long day.

Come on.

Listen, he's out on the toilett.

He's been having some gas issues.

Don't tell him I told you.

I thought the toilett was broken,

that's why I came.

He may just be looking at the mirror.

He's got this growth on his ass.

Don't tell him I told you.

Honey!

Cleveland's here.

He's come to fix the toilett.

Tell him I fixed already.

I called the plumber this morning.

Don't let it hurt his feelings.

Right.

That's.. That's Ok.

I should come when you call.

It's my job.

What if that things out there

will try to catch you?

There are laws.

It will be safe.

I'm allowed to leave this night.

-How long do you think?
-It is time.

You must not watch.

Am I not allowed to wacht you leave?

I won't watch.

Thank you for letting me
wear your beautiful shirt.

Keep it.

What happened?

Ok.

Ok.

Hey, calm down!

Calm down!

How did you get those scratches?

Did the eagle come?

Did something go wrong?
Story!

Story!

Was it that dog again?

I thought it was gonna be safe!

Your face doesn't look right. Are you Ok?

Mr. Heep. is here, he has a friend.

She is beautiful!

She's not feeling that well,

so she is laying down in my room.

Why is she here?

Why isn't she in his place?

Oh, she got sick in
the stairway downstairs.

She is wearing no clothes under his shirt.

Blim-blam.

Mr. Heep is a player.

I hope it's all right.

It's fine.

Do we need to take her to the hospital?

No, no no no. That's...

Fine?

Thank you.

No, she just needs some rest.

She can stay as long as she needs to.

You started writing again?

Yeah.

I'll be right back, Ok?

Hello!

Mrs. Choi,

is Young-Soon at home?

No home!

No? All right!

Unbelivable!

Hey, hey!

Thanks!

Yeah, hallo!
Mr. Heep?

Where are you?
At a club!

Don't tell my mother!
She thinks I'm at a dance class.

Ok!

What happens if a Narf gets scratched?

I don't know,
put my mother on I'll ask her!

Oma, Oma!
This is yours Mrs. Choi.

Hey!
Thank you!

She.. she doesn't look happy.

She said the story her grandmother told

said, the Scrunt has a poison to kill a Narf,

but, she said Narf can protect themselves.

They have given a Marcode key
that cures them.

They keep it where they live.

Ok, Ok, all right.

You said that the eagle
comes to take them back.

U-huh.

Right.

Now, what stops this green thing
from attacking them,

when the eagle comes.

You're funny Mr. Heep!
You've really thought about this!

Put my Mom on!

Hey!
Yeah! Thanks!

Yes?

She said only a Rog Scrunt
will break the law of that night

because most Scrunts are afraid.

Afraid of what?

Thatuthic!

They are the law keepers
in this bedtime story.

Her grandmother said,
there are three of them,

but they are called one name: Thatuthic.

They live in the trees they are said
to look like monkeys.

Noone knows for sure because
noone who has seen them

has lived!

The legend said that
they were born so evil

that they killed their parents
on the night they were born.

The fear of them has kept justice
in the Blue World for centuries.

By Mr. Heep!

Thanks!

They have given a Marcod key
that cures them.

They keep it where they live.

My Mom figured out that I was at a club.

She made me come home.

She tell me more of the story.

Why are you wet?

A.. Apartment business.

Listen Mr. Heep!

My mother things that you're a stranger.

You have to make her see you as a child.

Innocent!

Then she will tell you the bedtime story.

There is a reason
the rules might be broken.

A Dousen Narf is about a rare Narf

who comes once in a
generation of a Narfs

who is called the Madam Narf.

Her Versol is important.
This Versol will cause change.

But it is the Madam Narf herself
that is truly the key.

She's considered a queen to her people.

Her return will be seen
as a great inspiration.

A Scrunt will do anything
to kill a Madam Narf.

Even forget his fears of a Thatuthic.

He might break the rules
for that, Mr. Heep.

She know, that she is a Madam Narf?

No! That is moral of a bedtime story.

Noone is ever told who they are!

I think we are linked.

It's more than just a story to me too.

I actually want to believe it.

Good bye, Mr. Heep!

You saved my life again.

Have you made that room?

The cracks that I saw

is that room supposed to
collapse eventually?

I'm not allowed to speak
of the Blue World.

That door needs a little work.

I noticed that you took things
from the apartment

that people left around the pool.

That's how I saw you.

You were taking something
off of a chair.

I think I might know why
the Scrunt needs to get you so bad.

Why did he break the rules tonight?

If it turns out...
I think that you're someone

very important to everyone.

I tried to tell him about you
I don't know if I did the right thing.

I'm not sure how's he gonna react.

I trust you.
I believe you are here to protect me.

Is the key working?

Yes, thank you.

If it is true, that I am...

He'll keep coming after me.

I'll not be in safe until...

Until Thatuthic comes.

My mother said she saw
a ghost once in the basement.

I was the only one who believed her.

She'n not an apparition, Anna.

I don't know who you are,

but you did something to me.

My thoughts...

Everything became clear.

The fears that were modelling
my thoughts just went away.

I can hear myself.

Do you wish to know your future?

A boy, in the mid-west of this land
will grow up in a home

where your book will be on the
shelf and spoken of often.

He'll grow up with his ideas in his head.

He will grow into a great orator.

He will speak and his words
will be heard throughout this land

and throghout the world.

This boy will become
the leader of this country,

and begin a movement of great change.

He will speak of you and your words.

Your book will be the seeds of many
of his great thoughts.

It will be the seeds of change.

The cook-book?

Uno, dos, tres...

Could you tell her that
I was interested in hearing

more of the story.

Tell her it's a beautiful story.

Are there any parts that
might be good to hear?

How is she?

The medicin's helping her.

I told her to stay under the shower

she does much better with water.

I need to talk with her.

In fact you'd be there too.

I told them to wait right outside
I'll tell them what you have to say.

Tell her I know that she's
not allowed to tell about her world

but maybe I could ask some
questions and she could just say

If it's right or wrong.

You know what I did when I was a
little girl and me and my girlfriends

would get in big trouble?

My Mom always wanted
to know what happened

but I was like: I can't tell on my friends.

So. She came up with this way

of me telling her things without talking.

She would say: touch your ear

point something if the answer is yes.

So I would, and then she would
know certain things

but I didn't really feel like
I told on my friends.

It was cheating I know but

made me feel better.

We are ready!

So, in this bedtime story

a Narf has come to a
pretty ordained place

she must leave from the same spot.

This eagle, the Great Eathlon
coming to take her back

is really very important,

and here is the good stuff.

There are humans with powers

that can help her.

And these people have been
unconciously drawn

to live near the Versol.

These humans don't know who they are

and they always appear
in the story earlier.

Are there humans with powers
that can help you

but don't know who they are?

That's a Yes!

They got weird names: a Symbolist,

a Guardian, and the Guild.

Ask her if that's right!

You want something.

One of them.

Vick!

Mr. Heep!

Mr. Heep is one of them.

Which one?

Guild, Guardian?

She thinks Mr. Heep is the Guardian!

I was told that there's a Symbolist,

an interpreter who can read
signs in clouds

and other forms.

He will interpret messages...

...from the Universe,
if problem should arise.

Do you know who the Symbolist

or interpreter is?

That's a No.

And I was told that there is a Guild

whose many hands will combine to help.

Does she know who they are?

There is a Guild or something,

they're supposed to help
with their hands.

That's another No.

All right. There's one other.
I don't know if it's worth mentioning

it's not in the stories all the time.

It's a human, usually a female.

So full of hope that they
can awaken the life force

and other things.

Now that one's called the Healer.

You can't tell that they're in the story,
because butterflies are drawn to the Healer.

Last one's a Healer... You don't know
any of these people, do you?

Reading?

A book?

Learning?

She thinks it has to be a word.

Is the eagle going to come back for her?

Only one last time.

Mr. Heep you know the people in this
building, you have to find them!

What is it?

You know these walls are paper thin?

I can hear all the bloody noise
downstairs like they're in my kitchen.

Can you do anything about that?

Of course not.

What is it you want anyway?

I had a question.

You're an expert of plots, right?

You know who's gonna do what

in a book or a movie even
at the beginning, yes?

There is no originality left
in the world Mr. Heep.

That is a sad fact I've come to live with.

If there was a mystery

and a guy had to figure out

who some people were

he had to find a symbol guy

someone can figure out messages.

and a Guild of people who are going
to be important at the end as a group.

How would you figure that out?

The symbol person should be simple.

Look for any character who
was doing something mundane,

but required analysis.

Someone who was skilled at puzzles.

Joey, you can't have cereals for lunch.

This picture on cereal box
is supposed to make you feel happy.

But I feel sad like that time
you forgot to pick me up at school.

Joey, Mr. Heep appears disquieted
can you give us a moment alone?

Sure, Dad.

As for the Guild?

Look for any group of characters
that are always seen together

and have seemingly irrelevant and tedious
dialogue that seems to regurgitate forever.

...and you just sit around
and talk about nothing?

Oh.. we talk about serious issues.

On occassion.

We talked about Martin Luther King,
in the Tequila Hut on Tuesday night.

You talked about him?

This is the writers way

of establishing characters
who would be important

further in the story.

Is there anything further

I can assist you with
during my nap time?

No, no Mr. Farber, thank you!

Story, these young men are the Guild.

And Mr. Dury... Mr. Dury?

Mr. Dury is the interpreter.

And there's one other person Mrs. Bell,

could you come in here please?

This is Mrs. Bell.

The Healer.

Story wants to go home, and she can't.

Tomorrow night is her last chance.

Mr. Dury please step forward.

Mr. Heep, you're not stuttering!

I know, I know, it's only around her!

Now, the interpreter will tell us what to
do if something should go wrong.

He'll use an instrument specific to him

to interpret.

Try it Mr. Dury!

Let's just see what happens!

I think that there's a
message in there for us.

Nine-letters across...

it's the word essential

and ...

and it touches...

twenty-seven down

which is scheme.

Essential scheme.

Yes.

Those were the first two words

that I deciphered from this puzzle

I thought that is...

I.. I.. I thought that is weird.

This word that seems out of place to me.

It's a six-letter word for get together.

Soirée!

Soirée could mean party,
how does a party help us?

Well, I guess... I thought that

you know, a party is interesting

because this thing
out there is an animal

and probably has a very
keen sense of smell.

Why is everyone staring at me?

Go on, go on Mr. Dury, Go on!

Humans have a ponging smell to animals, so

I thought that maybe
everyone gethered together

would confuse him and he wouldn't be
able to distinguish her

from amongst all of us.

Wow!

Is that sound right?

He's hearing the voice of God
for a cross word puzzle

He's playing here, right?

Wait, wait!

I don't think that the Great Eathlon
will land in the presence of

beings not from its world.

She didn't want me to watch
when the eagle came for the first time.

But that was before she knew
that I was the Guardian.

Will I be allowed to watch now?

There are hundreds of people at the party,
it won't work, it won't work,

see if there's anything
else in there Mr. Dury.

This word did give me
a great difficulty.....

Sonorous!

It could mean music. A band.
Maybe we gether everyone inside

at the last minute to hear a band

and we -who are of the world-

stay with her to help her

... with that thing and

... until she is taken!

He's a prophet!

No, no, no no no no no!

I think that it worked!
I think that it worked!

That is why they're the Guild!

I think, they're supposed to use
their hands to throw us a party!

We're gonna throw a party!

Huge party! Serious...

You don't think this is
gonna work, do you?

I'm nervous too.

You'll be out there tomorrow night,

me not knowing
what to do as the Guardian.

I think I can go out there tonigh
maybe face that thing without you?

Get a little practice with him?

Scare him maybe?

Show him who's the boss?

Hm?

I know you wanna get home.

You will need a mirror.

Can you hear me?

I'm here.

Peer over your shoulder carefully!

It is only through a mirror that one can
see the eyes of a Scrunt in the grass.

It will appear to you as two
red spots in the darkness.

Ya, I don't.. I.. I...

I.. I see him!

The Guardian has instincts of
when the Scrunt will attack

is a great weapon against him.

You should walk backwards
towards him.

When you are close enough
to be certain of his position

turn and face the hidden Scrunt!

I'm facing him!

I am scared!

He's about to get very dangerous!

Ok!

I'm ready!

You must invoke the ancient words:
Neph Rah Mora.

It is a command to rise,

and a challenge to fight.

Neph Rah Mora.

What is happening?

He's rising out of grass.

His legs are bending and coiling

underneath... Oh my God!

He's standing in front of me.

The Guardian can hypnotise the Scrunt

if the Guardian looks directly
into the Scrunt's eyes

it will be compelled to stay frozen
or move backwards.

What is the Jaygee Scrunt's reaction?
Is he frightened?

I'm not sure!

Look into his eyes!

I am!

Is he moving away?

No!

The Guardian can controll his mind,

the Jaygee Scrunt will not
be able to attack!

Ok!

You must look into his eyes!

I think something's wrong!

He's stepping forward!

He's stepping forward?

Something's wrong!

Cleveland run!

What is it you are doing?

Uuh... uuh.

Is there anything I can do for you Mr. F.. Farber?

No.

So, how was the... movie?

Sucked.

Oh, what a shame.

Characters were walking around
saying their thoughts out loud.

Who does that?

In a typical romance with a couple
finally tell each other

they love one another in the rain.

Why does everyone like to stand
around and talk in the rain in movies?

Huh, I think that...

Maybe ...

Maybe it's a methaphor for a purification starting new?

No! It's not!

Are you Ok?

He'll choose to move only
when noone is looking.

They're the masters of hiding.

Scrunt will hide unless he
cannot hide in his enviroment.

If a tenant hadn't walked by,

I might have been eaten alive.

I had no powers over him.

You're not the Guardian.

I do not understand.

I cannot protect you.

Where are the Thatuthic?

Why isn't he being punished?

Where is the justice?

How come you don't ask
about bedtime story anymore?

I've been busy.

Are you coming at the party tonight?

I have to study.

Bye Mr. Heep!

Mr. Leeds, did you
hear about the party?

Are you coming?

Does man deserved
to be saved, Mr. Heep?

What?

Man.

Yes!

That's not the answer I expected.

Why do you ask me that?

I know about your family.

I looked you up when
you started working here.

I know someone killed them.

But you can't give up.

You can't hide here, son.

I know.

You don't wanna become like me.

By the way your invitation would sound
more real if it had the guy's name on it.

There's something strange
going on around this building,

don't think I haven't noticed!

It is finished?

You can see things in the future.

Some things.

I've a question to ask you.

I will do my best to answer it.

You'll tell me the truth, right?

Yes.

Change does't  happen the way
you say it's gonna happen

without dramatic events
that accelerate thinking.

I wrote this thing it might takes decades
or longer to create a reaction.

Before anchors in the conciousness.

That's not the type of change
you tell me is gonna happen, right?

I was wondering why he didn't meet me.

This leader who is just a boy,

if he's so inspired by my words,

why didn't he try to meet me?

There's a lot of things in this cook-book
people won't like to hear.

I'm not anything... you know,

I don't think I'm anything special.

So I started thinking
how is this gonna happen?

Why are people gonna
suddenly take me seriously

and why didn't he meet me?

And I thought of how it could happen?

Story, I wanted to ask you...

is something gonna happen to me?

Someone gonna kill me
because I write this?

Yes.

Man thinks that they're
each alone in this world.

It is not true.

You're all connected.

One act can one day affect all.

What are you guys whispering about?

Is he trying to get to tell you
how many kids he's gonna have?

I told him 8 all pretty boys.

I asked her if she knew the name
of the deaf, dumb and blind guy

that's gonna marry you.

Very funny!

Ok.

Don't tell my sister.

Hi! I'm Mr. Farber!

I wanted to thank you!

I was completely
suprised by all of this!

I was expecting some
kind of greeting, of course,

but this is beyond my expectations.

I'm 13B.

Oh yeah, good for you!
Yeah, what's up!

I know of your future Cleveland.

Do you wanna hear it?

No.

Tell me what happens when
the eagle takes you back.

It is only what I've been told by others.

They tell us the World will line up
and reveal we are on the right path.

Then the Universe will give us signs.

The Thatuthic has not come yet.

I can still sense this Scrunts presence near here.

You have to believe that
this all makes sense somehow.

I don't know why I'm the Madam Narf.

I'm not special.

Clumps even make fun of me.

I don't know how to lead.

Do you get sick everytime you break the rule?

Everytime that you tell me
something that you shouldn't.

There's a storm coming.

I am scared.

That's Ok to be scared.

I do not have courage.

I do not want to be a Madam Narf.

You do what you think is right!

You are very brave!

You were always meant to lead, Story!

Cleveland!

The Great Eathlon is coming!

I'm glad you've read my junk.

Don't worry!

We're all watching you!

Come on, the music should have started already.

Do not leave this spot!

Hey!

Find a mirror!

Why hasn't the music started?

It's been working smooth.
We've been playing with it all night.

You've used up the battery!

Wave to him!

They told that all the Universe
will line up and reveal

that we are on the right.. path.

Why isn't this working?

Ok.

Sometimes animals just look dead.

Something went wrong.

They took her inside.

It is not time for you to go.

It is not time

for you to go.

Isn't this supposed to work?

Fourteen cross...

No, no...

I don't know.

I don't know.

This world is about finding
your purpose, right?

And the only way to do that is to find
your own voice you told us that.

I don't feel like an Interpreter.

Is it possible that it isn't my purpose?

I don't see anything in these words,
that I didn't before!

Finding one's purpose is a profound thing.

Sometimes it isn't always what it seems.

What if these young men are not the Guild?

Look at what happened at the party!

These things haven't seemed right
from the beginning.

Why are you so certain that I'm
the interpreter and they are the Guild.

He was so sure!

What?

I ...

... asked someone.

He acted like he knew.

What kind of person would be so arrogant
to persumed to know the intention

of another human being?

Who was put this young
girl's life in jeopardy?

Hallo!

Is the bathroom on this level working?

A dog inside the building?

Go! Shoot!

Oh you're not a dog at all!

My God!

This is like a moment
from a horror movie.

This precisely the moment
where the mutation or beast

will attempt to kill an
unlikeable side character.

But in stories where there has
been no prior cursing,

nudity, killing or death,
such as in a family film,

the unlikeable character will
narrowly escape his encounter,

and be referenced to get later in the story

having learn valuable lessons.

He may even be given a humourous
moment to allow the audience

to feel good about.

This is where I turn to run.

You will leap for me,

I will shut the door,

and you will land a fraction
of a second too late.

Why would they lie to her about the Thatuthic?

This cannot just be fairytales
that they tell to make the Narfs

risk their lives this is gotta be about faith!

Her world works by different rules
and she may not be dead.

We need to be told what to do.

We need to find the interpreter.

But how are we suddenly gonna
realise someone's purpose?

This is somebody's doing something ancient,

an ancient thing in modern times.

Could be someone who sees purity

in what we see as mundane.

Sees the voice of God in the ordinary.

Yes, someone who sees
meaning in the ordinary.

Does anyone have any idea who this is?

My God!

I do!

There is a message.

There is a ceremony to be done.

You're doing great, Joey!

Ssssh!

The hands of the Guild will be
needed plus two others.

Joey, who is the Guild?

It is a ceremony of seven sisters.

Sisters? The Guild is women?

They will touch together
with their hearts as one

to bring strenghts to the moment.

Nice, Joey!
Sssssh!

You will need a man who has no secrets,

and one who's oppinion is highly respected

as witnesses.

Almost three.

This whole all be over in moments.

Mr. Perez de la Torre!

I need to speak with your five daughters.

Honey!

Honey there's some
people here to see you.

Sweetheart!

He's probably rinsing his mouth.

He's got terrible breath.

Don't tell him I told you!

I think we have everybody.

A man who has no secrets

and one whose oppinion
I greatly respect.

They will be the witnesses.

will the Guild please come forward.

and you make seven.

Seven sisters.

Yeah.

Everything's right now.

Come back to us now.

Come back to us now honey,
come back to us!

I can't believe this!

This is crazy!

This woman is probably dying

as we're talking!

She needs to get to a hospital!

She is not right!

We can't just stand here
playing make believe.

I wanted to believe more than most.

I wanna be like child again!

I needed to believe that there's something
more than this awfulness around us

but at some point we have to stop!

Mr. Leeds!

It is time to proof some stories are real!

I read it wrong.

It was my first time,

I thought that it said she will lead
the ceremony of the seven sisters

to bring strenghts to the moment.

I looked at it again.

It says he,

he will lead the ceremony of seven sisters

to bring strenghts to the moment.

Mrs. Bell is not the Healer.

It said the Healer could be a man?

I.. I.. I saw a butterfly right on her!

Butterflies?

The bedtime story said

butterflies are drawn to the Healer.

Oh, Mr. Heep, you brought
that butterfly to me!

It cought my eyes you walked over.

I did?

Oh, wow!

Oh!

Wait, no!

You must try!

There's no time!

I can't, I can't, I can't!

Shut up!

And try!

Say something to bring out your energy.

I'm sorry I couldn't protect you!

I should have been there.

I am always gonna regret

just not being there.

How I miss your faces!

How they remind me of God!

I'm so lost without you guys!

I met this very nice lady and

her name is Story.

I think you would have liked her.

I think she might be...

an angel.

But she has to go home.

I love you all.

I love you all so much!

Thank you for all you have done!

Your sister will have seven children.

You will see the first two.

Oh my God!

He's the Guardian!

Reggie!

Reggie, Reggie just keep
looking in his eyes!

Keep looking in his eyes!

Thank you for saving my life.
