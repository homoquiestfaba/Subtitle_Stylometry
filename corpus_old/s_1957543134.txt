[car accelerating]

[tires screeching]


[electric buzzing]

[heartbeat thumping]


[chattering on TV]

[heartbeat continues]

Welcome back
to the world of the living.

[TV chattering continues]

[indistinct PA announcement]
So?

I'm Dr. Sarkisian.

You've been in
a very bad car accident.

You ruptured your heart
due to trauma,

which we were forced
to repair surgically.

Tessa?

[laughter, chattering on TV]

[seagulls squawking]

[ship horn blows
in distance]

[dishes clattering]

Morning.

Morning.
I made pancakes.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go shoot photos.

Oh, it's so cold outside.

Yeah, I just don't want
to miss the morning light.

Well, maybe when you're back, we could
do a little research for colleges.

All right. Bye.

["Teenage Headache Dreams"
playing]

She hides behind
that camera.

She's not taken
a single picture of us.

You're too pretty.
You'd break her lens.

Hey, I told you.
You've gotta let her come to you.

It's been a year.
Signing a piece of paper doesn't make us her parents.

Actually it does.

â™ª I want to be free â™ª

â™ª Remember how
We used to be? â™ª

â™ª Sit at home and dream â™ª

â™ª Stare at each other
Like TV â™ª

[shutter clicks]

â™ª Teenage headache dreams â™ª

â™ª Come back to me at night â™ª

â™ª And try as though I might
To live for now â™ª

â™ª Teenage headache dreams â™ª

â™ª Seems like
The good time's over â™ª

â™ª But nothing's really
Over anymore â™ª

â™ª Just take control â™ª

â™ª I want to be free â™ª

â™ª Romanticize reality â™ª

â™ª Reminds me what it means â™ª

â™ª To be me â™ª

â™ª Teenage headache dreams â™ª

â™ª I'll give up
on the fight â™ª

â™ª To try as though I'd like
To leave the moment â™ª

â™ª I don't know how â™ª

â™ª Teenage headache dreams â™ª

â™ª Up all night
Oh, back again â™ª

You open, Sherman?

I am for you, Tessa.

Um, I think I'm
a little short.

That's no crime.
I'm only 5'6".

Enjoy the show.

[instrumental music
playing on screen]

[people shouting]

[alarm ringing]

[Zorg speaking French]

Sherman, where are
the subtitles?

You watch. I'll translate.

[speaking French]

"It's the first time
we've met in daylight."

[speaking French]

"But you're very early."

I think I'm just gonna go
tell the theater owner.

I mean, there's nothing he can do about it.
They obviously sent him the wrong print.

I can get my money back.

I've seen this film before.
I don't think you want to miss it.

Does it have a happy ending?

No. Definitely not.

Okay. Then I'll say.

[speaking French]

"You gonna eat
all that chili by yourself?

In this heat, you're mad."

[Zorg speaking French]

"I eat chili no matter
how hot it is, Betty."

[both speaking French]
"Those bastards." "What?"

"Never mind. Kiss me."

[Betty speaking French]

"Those bastards.
How could they do this to you?"

[continues translating,
indistinct]

I'm sorry.
How long was I doing that?

I lost feeling
about an hour ago,

so I'm not sure.
Why didn't you say something?

Um, the movie is
a bit of a downer, so...

It's a love story.

I mean,
not all love stories are downers.

All the good ones are.

Romeo and Juliet,
Anna Karenina,

The English Patient.
Mm-hmm.

I think it's the ending
of a relationship,

that's what makes
a love story so memorable.

What about
Pride and Prejudice?

Jane Eyre?
Those both have happy endings.

That's only because the writer chose
to end their love stories prematurely.

Wow. That is
a really interesting way

of not admitting
you're wrong.


Come on! Okay. Picture this.

Picture that Leonardo DiCaprio
didn't die at the end of Titanic.

Do I have to? Oof.
You have to.

Jack Dawson is a jobless,
penniless gambler,

who possessed, at best,
marginal artistic talent.

He saved Rose's life.
Right, of course.

But he also love-bombed her and
stole her away from her fiancÃ©.

And poor Rose was just so
hypnotized by that steamy car sex,

that she really thought that he'd give
her a life of passionate adventure?

Please, come on. That's a life of abject
poverty and dehumanizing infidelity.

Titanic 2. If you thought
part one was a disaster...

Oh, my gosh.

[clears throat]

I...
[Sherman] Time to go!

Jesus, this guy is getting
a one-star review, for sure.

So, um, how did you get
so good at speaking French?

My dad is a foreign
languages professor.

So by the time I was 12, he had me
fluent in French, Spanish, and Italian.

Oh! Oh, my gosh.

If I could just read Dante's
Inferno in the original Italian,

my life would be complete, I think.
I get that a lot.

Really?
No. No, I've never gotten that before.

That's some pretty old gear you got there.
You don't shoot digital?

No, I don't. I get a much
higher dynamic range on film.

Plus, I'm also kind of addicted to
the smell of the developing chemicals.

The fumes make me a little delirious.

Kind of like what your eyes
are doing to me right now.

Ooh.

That...

[both chuckle]

That was really cheesy.
No, no.

It was... It was...

a little cheesy, yeah.

It sounded perfect
in my head.

Oh, okay. Then let me imagine that for a sec, okay.
Okay.

Still bad?
It's worse, actually.

Somehow, I don't know.

[door opens]
[exhales]

Um, I should probably...

Yeah, me too.

Um, thank you for letting me

whisper in your ear
for three hours.

You are welcome.

Skylar.
What?

My name is...
It's Skylar.

I'm Tessa.

Maybe I'll see you here
again sometime.

Yeah, I'd like that.


Oh! My jacket.

[seagulls squawking]

[shutter clicking]

[clock ticking]

[ticking slows, distorts]

Sky. You're alive!

[heartbeat thumping]

Come on. I want
to show you something.

[lights humming]

Sky!

Bad dream.

You called out his name.

It's called a visitation dream.
We see lots of 'em around here.

It's all part
of the grieving process.

I know. It just felt
like Skylar was really here.

Doris would love to hear about that.
Who's Doris?

A patient writing a book on the afterlife.
Okay.

The other day,
she offered to read my aura.

I politely declined.

What is that?
Your belongings from the crash.

They closed
the accident report already?

Well, neither driver had drugs
or alcohol in their system.

That's usually
the end of it.

They never even
interviewed me.

You said you didn't remember
anything about the accident?

I don't.
Maybe that's for the best.

[Dr. Sarkisian]
I'm very encouraged, Tessa.

The scan shows
your right ventricle

is functioning quite well,
despite the tear.

Finally, some good news.

It is more than good.

Ninety-nine out of 100 with this
same injury die on my table.

I did die.

Only for a short time.

I could see Skylar.

Like, he was in this...
this crazy white light.

What is that?
Was she, you know, hallucinating?

When the body undergoes
severe trauma...

[heartbeat thumping]
...the hypothalamus can flood the brain

with pain relieving endorphins.
[Vickie] So when can we take her home?

[Dr. Sarkisian] End of the week. Tessa needs
to be extremely careful these next few months.

Any chest pains
or shortness of breath,

you call 911 immediately.
Understand?

[shower running]

[heartbeat thumping]


[crying continues]

[knocking on door]

Jazz? Just give me a second.

Jazz?

[electrical crackling]

[phone chimes, buzzes]

You watch, I'll translate.

[indistinct PA announcement]

Hi, excuse me.
Are you Doris?

a wild guess here.

Room B424,
girl with the broken heart?


I'm not psychic.

Jasmine told me you might come looking for me.
Oh.

My condolences.

Thank you.

Are your hands injured?

Excuse me?

From the accident.
Did you hurt your hands at all?

No, why?
Ta-da! Huh?

Oh, come on. Come on.

So, what is your book about?

It's about ADC's.

After Death Communication.

Okay, so you believe that
dead people can contact us?

Along with billions
of other people

from faiths
that span the globe.

Sometimes, the departed,

they call out
to us in voice.

And other times, we can smell their
cologne or perfume in the air.

No matter how they communicate,
the message is the same.

"I'm still here.

And your grief,
like a beacon,

calls me to your side."

And when the separation
has been traumatic,

like with you
and your boyfriend,

there's often
unfinished business.

Like regrets or something?

Like things left undone
or unsaid.

[door opens]
[Vickie] Tessa.

We signed you out.
It's time to go.

He's in the in-between.

But he won't be there for
long, a few weeks at most.

And when he moves on...

he's gone for good.

I gotta go.
Oh, wait, wait.

Here, take this.
It's my first book.

It's a good place to start.
That's okay.

He's reaching out to you.

Reach back.

It's too late for that.

Tessa, you're up.

[clears throat]

Um, this is a photo that
I took back in February.

Is that how you spend your free
time, taking pictures of trees?

Well, it's actually
not a tree, asshole.

[class laughs]
It's a cell phone tower,

disguised as a tree.

It is an allegory for the
artificiality of modern life.

[school bell rings]

It's a lovely photo, Tessa.

Your technical skills have
taken huge leaps this year.

Oh, thank you.
I know you're still a junior,

but I think you have a good shot of getting
into the Rhode Island School of Design.

I'd be happy to write you
a letter of recommendation.

Thank you. I just...
My work's not ready for that yet.

Oh? What do you feel
is missing?

Just like a point of view.

You know, something to say
that's my own.

Well, maybe it's time for
your subject matter to evolve.

After all, there is something
notably missing from all your photos.

Yeah, I know. Color.

No. People.

You know, Tessa,
before an artist can find her voice,

she has to find
a subject she loves.

Who or what
do you love, Tessa?

["Closer" playing]

I should probably...

Yeah, me too.

â™ª Love like this
Don't come often â™ª

â™ª So I'll just
Keep on talking â™ª

â™ª I've been dancing in
circles Hoping you'd fall â™ª

â™ª I'm so fixed
on your lips â™ª

â™ª Time feels so frozen â™ª

â™ª And I never want
To press play â™ª

â™ª So come a little closer â™ª

â™ª Come a little closer â™ª

â™ª Come a little closer â™ª

â™ª Come a little closer â™ª

â™ª Don't be shy â™ª

â™ª Come a little closer â™ª

â™ª Let's get older tonight â™ª

â™ª Come a little closer â™ª

Hey, okay.
What do you think?

Red?
Noisy colors are trendy.

I don't know. I feel like you're kind of
taking advantage of your dad's niceness.

Of course, I am.
My dad is putty when I get straight A's.

Hey, yo, Tess!

Hi, Cortez.
Hey, uh, do you have plans this weekend?

As it happens, I actually work
as Tessa's full-time scheduler,

so I can say, with absolute authority,
that she does not have any plans

this weekend.
What are you saying? What are you doing?

Well, the final crew meet of
the season is this Saturday.

I was kind of wondering if you
'd come out and take some photos.

Uh, sorry. I don't really do
sports photography.

But if you glue a selfie stick to your
forehead, it might be the same thing.

Will Judd be there?

Well, wherever I go,
my rowing partner goes, so...

Then we'll be there.

"We" will be there?

I'll be there as your photo
assistant, remember?

I'm her photo assistant.

Well, the first race
starts at 6:30.

In the morning?
He didn't mean morning, did he?

Yup, he did.

[spectators cheering]

Do you think Judd
can see me from here?

Hey!
You are fired. Give me this.

Assistanting is
not my thing. My bad.

You were the one who dragged me out here.
So behave, please.

Racers, starting positions.

Ready your marks.

Row!

[air horn blows]
[rowers grunting]

[heartbeat thumping]

[air horn blowing]

[spectators cheering]

Whoo! Whoo!
Yeah!

[both laughing]
Yes!

Whoo!

You never said he was hot.

Yes, I did.
No, you said he was cute.

Emojis are cute. That guy is
like melting my sunglasses, Tess.

I think I'm gonna go.
Are you crazy?

You've been obsessed about this guy for
like months, and you're just gonna ditch?

I don't know what to say to him.
"Hold me."

He just won the race.
Congratulate him.

Okay.

Can I put this on my Story?

If you wanna die.

Tessa! Hey... Oh!

Oh, my God! Sorry.
Whoa, whoa!

My legs are always
Jell-O after races.

I can't believe
that you're a...

A jock?

A jock, yeah!

Jocks don't speak
Spanish, French and Italian.

Hey, this one does.
Well, they definitely don't read

Jane Austin and
Emily BrontÃ«.

I have a thing for happy endings.
Skylar!

Oh, shit. Here we go. Um...

That is what I
call a finish.

Thanks, Mom.

Um...
Movie theater girl.

Her name is Tessa.
How did you...

The blue eyes.
Skylar went on and on about them.

Wow, Mom! Does anyone see a
deep, dark hole I can crawl into?

searching for you on the Internet.

Mom...
[Leigh] And he couldn't find a thing about you.

Well, that is by design.
[phone ringing]

Told you.
She's analog. Like me.

is driving me crazy.

Talk to him, Mom.
Tell him... Tell him I won.

No. You can talk to him yourself later. Are you
going to be heading back to Edison tonight?

No, I'm gonna be staying
at Grandpa Mike's. Um...

But first, I was gonna see if
Tessa maybe wanted to go...

Chill out and hang?


Movie theater
girl would love

to chill out and hang.
[Leigh chuckles]

All right. Bye.
Thanks.

[footsteps departing]
Thank you, Mom.

That's my mom.
She does, uh, parties.


[horn honks]

I can put the top up
if you want.

It feels really good.


Say it in French.

[speaking French]

You too.

Um...

You don't have
a girlfriend, do you?

No. Not since
the eighth grade. Why?

This kinda looks like you.


That's my mom and dad when they were teenagers.
Oh!

Yeah, this is actually the
same Jeep that my grandpa

bought my mom
for her 18th birthday.

You can actually see it
behind them in the photo.

Oh, yeah! They're so cute.
They look so in love.

Yeah, they were.
"They were"?

Are. They are.

My dad's just living and
teaching in Oregon right now.

That's pretty far. Are they,
like, taking a break or something?

No.

They're gonna be fine.
They talk almost every day, so...

Some music.

Whoa!
If you wanna take a look.


Yeah, it's my mom's entire
high school playlist.

New Order. Cake. Bush.

Echo and the Bunnymen.

Your mom's like
my new bestie.

Your dad made
her a mix tape?

Yes, he did.

Can I play it?

It's the other way.
[both chuckle]

It's okay. I won't tell the '80s police.
Shut up.

â™ª Don't ask me
What you know is true â™ª

â™ª Don't have to tell you â™ª

â™ª I love your
precious heart â™ª

â™ª I â™ª

â™ª I was standing â™ª

â™ª You were there â™ª

â™ª Two worlds collided â™ª

â™ª And they could never
Tear us apart â™ª

I have spent every summer of my
life down here with my grandfather.

How have I never
heard of this place?

Well, that's my favorite
part about taking photos.

It's like you just stumble and
wander and find places like this.

Right. But what...
what drew you to this spot specifically?

The view.

That view.

[seagulls squawking]

It was called
The Empyrean.

It was a honeymooners'
resort back in the '60s.

It's so surreal.
It's unbelievable.

You've gone in there?

Unarmed?

I'll do anything
for a great photo.

"Empyrean"?

That's where Dante
meets God, right?

Highest of all heavens.
A place of pure love.

Look at it. If that's not a metaphor
for love, then I don't know what is.

Can I see your photos?

They're not on my phone.
I don't shoot digital, remember?

Well, how do people
see your work?

I don't show it,
unless I have to for class.

How come?

'Cause I'm not
good enough yet.

I find that seriously
difficult to believe.

Okay, so if you won't
show me your photos,

maybe you can give me a tour.
Of The Empyrean?

Yeah, show it to me.

I wanna see it, you know,
through your eyes.

["Never Tear Us Apart"
playing]

[both laughing]

â™ª We could live â™ª

â™ª For a thousand years â™ª

â™ª But if I hurt you
I'd make wine â™ª

[tennis ball thwacking]
[both grunting]

â™ª From your tears
I told you â™ª

â™ª That we could fly â™ª

â™ª 'Cause we all have wings â™ª

â™ª But some of us
Don't know why â™ª

â™ª I was standing â™ª

â™ª You were there â™ª

â™ª Two worlds collided â™ª

â™ª And they could never
Ever tear us apart â™ª

[piano keys playing]

Do you know how to waltz?

No.
Okay, just step back this way.

Okay.
And then your back foot forward.

And then it's like one, two, three.
Straighten your leg.

One, two, three.

Okay.

And then you have to put
your chin up and then lead.

Like you don't want to pay any
attention to the other person.

Don't slip.
[both laughing]

â™ª You don't ask me â™ª

â™ª You were standing â™ª
â™ª You know it's true â™ª

â™ª I was there â™ª
â™ª Worlds collided â™ª

â™ª Two worlds collided â™ª
â™ª We're shining through â™ª

â™ª And they could never
Tear us apart â™ª

â™ª I â™ª

â™ª I was standing â™ª

Do you want to see what it's
like to be inside of a camera?

Yeah.
Okay. Close the door.

It works just like
a camera lens.

I kind of made it myself.

Whoa.

It's beautiful.

Yeah.

[playing harmonica]

I mean,
it's pretty good, right?

Ooh, I mean, it's obvious you just
haven't been playing that long.

Just three years.
Oh.

Should have heard me
back then.

[both laughing]

Can you hear them?

Hear who?

The ghosts of
newlyweds past.

No. What are they saying?

Well, the groom,
he's saying...

[in deep voice]
Come on, honey.

You've been in the bathroom
for two hours now.

It's time to come to bed.
You're my wife.

What does the bride say?

Well, the bride
is saying, um...

But you haven't even
kissed me yet.

Okay.
You want me to walk you to your door

so your parents don't think
I'm a... taxidermist?

What?

Or like someone...
a serial killer?

That's okay.
Um, they're not my parents, actually.

I, uh... I'm just a genetic stranger
that lives under their roof.

"A genetic stranger"?

Yeah, it's, uh...
It's a long story.

For another time.

When can I see you again?

Um, well, when are you
back in Avalon?

End of the month.

And how long are you
gonna be here for?

The whole summer.

I'm staying with my grandpa
until I leave for Brown.

You're going to Brown? What?

I just kissed
an Ivy League bro?

[gasps]
[laughs] Your street cred ruined?

Only if you tell me that
you're also a lifeguard.

Yeah.

Are you serious?
Mm-hmm.

About three summers now
at Washington Avenue Beach.

No! Why?

Good night.
Good night.

[heartbeat thumping]


[continues crying softly]

Do I need to kick
this guy's ass?

No, she's just scared.

Why?

Because she likes him.

[shutter clicks]


[footsteps approaching]

Shannon's waiting.

Okay, I'm coming.

Hey, what's that?

That is four
A's, one A-minus.

Don't want to talk about it.

I'm gonna tint the windows,
so no one knows it's me inside.

Geez, stop whining.
It's a car.

So did you call
the phone company?

Yeah.
And?

You were right. They just said that Skylar
probably sent the photo before the accident

and then it got stuck
in the server or something.

But that doesn't explain why my phone just
turned on after it was completely trashed.

Can you explain that?

I can't. No.


Hey.

It's totally normal
to read into things.

My mom did the same thing
after her sister died.

Every rainbow was a sign.

Every butterfly
was a message from heaven.

[door opens]

Meet my computer on wheels.

â™ª Don't ask me â™ª

â™ª What you know is true â™ª


Sorry. You put it
on my Spotify.

It's okay.

â™ª I love your... â™ª

[music stops]

Hey.

Talk to me, Tess.

I can't believe he's gone.

It's like I close my eyes

and I see us meeting
for the first time.

And I remember every word
that he said to me.

I remember every expression
on his face.

And then I open my eyes
and it's like...

Did I, like, just dream
our entire relationship up?

Did I dream him up?
Hey. I was there.

He wasn't a dream, okay?

Your head's just
a little scrambled.

That happens when two tons of
metal comes crashing into you.

I don't even remember the
last thing I said to him.

Come on.
I'm serious.

We were fighting
that last week, remember?

Hey.

You guys had an epic summer.

One that you will never forget.
Yeah.

Damn, I won't forget it,
and I was just a jealous bystander.


Oh, my God.

It's my first day back,
and I look like a total mess.

Yeah. You do.

[laughing]
You do, yeah.

[school bell ringing]

[phone chimes]

I heard about
what happened, Tessa.

I'm terribly sorry.

If you were my daughter,
I'd tell you to use it.

Use it?

The pain, the emptiness.

Channel it,
through your camera.

Some of the greatest works of art
were produced by intense grief.

Okay.
Tessa.

RISD portfolio day
is right around the corner.

Thank you.

[seagulls squawking]

["Perfect Day" playing]

You're just giving up
your photography?

It sure looks like it.

This is the same crap
your mom used to pull.

She'd become obsessed
with things.

Baking, yoga, pottery.

One day, lose interest,
move on to the next.

That's why she could never
get any traction in life.

Are you done?

You think Skylar
would have wanted this?

I don't know.

Why don't you go ask him?


[Skylar] It's okay. I won't tell the '80s police.
[Tessa] Shut up. [laughs]

[heartbeat thumping]

I'm still here, Tess.

Sky?

[seagulls squawking]

[footsteps approaching]

[Vickie] Tess?
I'm sleeping.

I just did a double shift.
You were asleep when I left.

Did you even eat anything?

I'm not hungry.

Can you please
just let me sleep?


[harmonica music
playing, faint]

No. No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no...


No, no, no. No, no...

No.

[heartbeat thumping]

[electrical crackling]

[heartbeat continues]

Hi.

[indistinct PA announcement]

Tessa?
Uh, I gotta talk to Doris.

Hang on a second.
Let me... Wait, Tessa.

What...
Her family took her home this morning.

There was nothing more we could do.
Are you okay, honey?

Um, I just haven't...
I haven't eaten today.

Um...
You know what, let me check you out.

Why do you need to talk to Doris so bad?
It's just...

It's about what she was telling me before.
It's about the afterlife.

Maybe that old coot
isn't so crazy after all.

What do you mean?
Your heartbeat is fast, but it sounds healthy.

Wait, what do you... What were you saying?
What do you mean?

Doris told me you'd
come looking for her.

She even left you something.

Her book.

Tessa, I have seen a lot of dying
and grieving in my time here.

Looking back
never helped anyone.

There's either life
or there's death.

There's no place in-between.

I'm gonna find him.

[Doris on video] What does
the in-between look like?

Well, we as living beings can never
imagine it. We have no reference.

It would be like trying to
describe a sunset to a blind man.

Technological advances have made
ghost-hunting a legitimate field.

My friend Darlene, she let me borrow
her full-spectrum digital camera.

This baby can pick up light
well beyond the human eye,

with infrared night vision...

[Shannon and Tessa laughing]
[thunder rumbling]

Well, happy Fourth of July.

I don't know. I actually kind of like this weather.
Don't call me.

So, you think this means
the fireworks are canceled?

I think so, yeah.
Yeah.

Hey.
Hey.

You okay?
Yeah.

Skylar, Tess says
you're going to Brown.

Congrats!
Thank you.

What are you gonna study?

Probably Latin.
That'll come in handy.

You never know when you're gonna
meet the Pope or something.

Or need to conduct
an exorcism.

Nice. That's nice.

I don't know. I just don't want
to have any regrets, you know?

I wanna live a bunch
of different lives.

What's the point of speaking
all these languages

if I'm not gonna travel the
world and use them, you know?

Let's go. We are going to
watch the fireworks on TV.

Are your parents home?

Do you want
to talk about it?

Not really.

Okay.

My mom filed
for divorce today.

I'm really sorry.

You know, I know this doesn't
help right now, but...

just because
they're splitting up

that doesn't mean that they
don't care about each other.

It means they've given up.

I don't think that's fair.
Fair to who? You or them?

and you get to the last 20 meters,

your entire body
is telling you to stop.

Your muscles are on fire.
Your lungs are screaming at you.

Everything inside you wants to
quit, make the pain go away.

But if you want to win,

that's exactly when you dig
deeper and you row harder.

You really don't like
to let things go, do you?

You noticed?
[laughs]

[fireworks boom]

[whistling, booming]


You're just starting to make
me believe in happy endings.

Oh, no! The photo! No.
Oh, oh...

What?
It's totally ruined. It's totally ruined.

Now you see why I don't
let anyone up here.

I am pretty amazed that you've
let me into your inner sanctum.

Yeah, well,
if you tell anyone,

I'll poison you.

Oh, you don't have to...

Hmm?
You don't have to look through that.

No, no, no. Okay.
Yeah.

It's cool.

I like this one.

That's, um...
That's a cell phone tower.

Yeah.
It's an allegory

for something... technology
co-opting our natural environment.

Really?

Really.

I know you hate compliments,
but this work is incredible.

I'm serious. It's like you can
see things that no one else can.

That just shows how much
you know about photography.


I mean, I think
you can sell this stuff.

Maybe on Etsy.

There is something
that's missing

from like all
of your photos.

Yeah, I know.
It's color.

No. You.

I just don't really think the
world needs another selfie.

Oh, come on. What is wrong with stepping in
front of the camera every once in awhile.

I believe that a photographer
should point her lens outward,

toward the world.
Yeah?

Yeah, so you can try
and understand it.

What about trying
to understand yourself?

If you had my past,
you wouldn't ask that question.

You ever gonna
tell me about it?



Come on.
I'll walk you home.

I never met my real father.
He ran off before I was born.

And my mom...

The kind way to describe her
would be flaky.

Wow.
Instead of counting sheep

to go to sleep
when I was a kid,

I would count her fiancÃ©s.

And Mel was
one of them?

Yeah, he was
the last one.

Her final victim before
she ghosted us for good.

And that's when
he took you in?

Well, he tried,
but the court,

they just didn't really look too
kindly on a middle-aged bachelor

wanting to adopt
a young girl.

So then where did you go?

Ah, Family Services.

Foster care.

Oh.

You know how you said
that I notice things

that no one else does?

Mm-hmm.

When you live with strangers
who can hurt you,

and I bounced around a lot,

you have to really just
observe everything.

When you're a foster kid,
you learn the hard way to...

Never put your guard down?

Yeah.

Anyway, about a year ago,
Mel and Vickie got married

and then the court
let them take me in.

So that's why you call
yourself a genetic stranger?

[buzzing, clicking]

I did that.
[scoffs]

["One Day" playing]

â™ª Sister don't mind
That I'm not on time â™ª

â™ª She knows that
I'm through with that â™ª

â™ª Sick of trying â™ª

â™ª True and kind â™ª

â™ª Call me aside
And I will now be â™ª

â™ª And I will be
Fine with that... â™ª


How early is it?
Super early.

A little splash
of almond milk, right?

Uh, yeah.

I like your necklace.

Yeah? Shannon
lent it to me.

You know, if you ever want to borrow anything
from me, clothes or makeup, jewelry...

All righty.

I'll see you later, Vick.

â™ª Oh, one day â™ª

See ya.

â™ª I'll be fine with that â™ª

â™ª You don't leave me now
Do you love me back? â™ª

[shutter clicks]

When a rower dies,
this is what heaven looks like.

For me, heaven is Paris in the rain.
Like cobblestone streets.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Is everything
in black and white?

Get out of my head.

You ever been? To Paris?

Someday.

Avec moi?

I guess I could use
a translator.

My parents had
their honeymoon there.

So I've been saving up
to send them

for their 25th anniversary.

What if they don't want to go?
I mean, who doesn't want to go to Paris?

Yeah, but what if they don't
want to go with each other?

It's not a crime to fall out of
love, you know.

Tessa.
Hmm?

Love never dies.

What?

You just sound like someone
who's never been hurt by life.

You putting me on notice?


Um, what the hell is that?

This...

is a rowboat.
I'm assuming you want me to get in that?

You are getting in this with me.
No.

We spent four hours in your dark
room doing what you love to do.

Let me show you
what I love to do.

[birds squawking,
chittering]

[Tessa] Hands under your... Thumbs there.
[Skylar] Thumbs here.

And then it's gonna go simple like that.
You press it down.

Okay.
And then you tilt it and then you pull it.

Hmm.
And then you're pressing down,

tilt it,
and then pull it.

Okay, I'm gonna try and go forward again.
All right.

Don't help me.
I won't.

I won't. You've got this.
You've got this.

[exhales sharply]


This is awful.
[Skylar laughs]

Oh, I'm tired now.
You're flying!

[Skylar playing harmonica]

I love you, Tessa.

[stammers softly]

We should probably
head back, yeah?

[slow pop music playing]

[moans softly]

[students chattering]

Hey.

"The in-between"?

That's just what
Doris calls it,

but every culture
has its own version of it.

So, it's where we go
after we die.

Not me. I'm going
to Jamaica.

I'm serious, Shannon.

It's like a waiting room
for our souls.

Okay, so you think Skylar

is reaching out to you
from this waiting room?

They were color photos, Shannon.
I don't... I don't shoot in color.

I don't even own
the chemicals to develop it.

But you can't show me the photos?
No, I told you.

The fixer didn't work.
I don't know why.

But maybe spirits can't be captured
on film or something. I don't know.

All right.

Tess, I want to believe
you, I swear,

but messages
from the other side?

I just think he wants
the same thing I want.

To see me one last time so that we can
actually say goodbye to each other.

You loved him,
and he knew that.

What more is there to say?

Two-minute warning.

Please take your seats

and set your phones
to silent mode.

Dude, we need
to focus, okay?

You're not even
listening to me.

Yes, I am!
I just don't think

this is about color photos or
waiting rooms or the in-between.

Then what is it about?
A girl who won't let go.

Just think about it.
Okay?

[door close]



Sorry.

[ringtone:
"Never Tear Us Apart"]

Cell phone use is prohibited
during the test!

â™ª That we could fly â™ª

[ringtone spreads to all cell
phones, overlapping]

[students murmuring]

â™ª That we could fly... â™ª

â™ª 'Cause we all have wings â™ª

â™ª But some of us
Don't know why â™ª

â™ª I was standing
You were there â™ª

â™ª Two worlds collided â™ª

â™ª And they could never
Ever tear us apart â™ª

Didn't I tell you
the drive would be worth it?

This negative's made of glass.
It's coated in collodion,

then dipped in silver
nitrate, which is crazy.

Because after that, you only ave
a few minutes to take the photo

or the chemicals
completely dry up.

Hmm. That's exactly
what I was gonna say.

It's only ten grand.

It's a little
out of my budget.

But I can offer you
a gluten-free cracker

with rotting cheese on it.
You're so generous. it's crazy.

Sorry. Am I interrupting?

No. Julian, hi.

We were just talking about how much we love the photo.
Oh, yeah.

It's wonderful, isn't it?

I just love how
he prioritizes

mood and atmosphere
over subject.

That is a very sophisticated
insight for a girl your age.

Julian, meet my very
sophisticated girlfriend.

Hi, I'm Tessa.
Nice to meet you.

Congratulations on this. This is great.
Oh, thank you.

Okay, kids, follow me.
I wanna show you something.

Doesn't it look amazing
all lit up like this?

Like it belongs here?
It does belong here.

Tessa, you have
an extraordinary eye.

I don't understand.

It's for sale
for $1,000.

Yeah, and we already have
two serious inquiries.

[heartbeat thumping]
Uh, this photo

is not for sale.
This was a gift to Skylar.

Can't you print
another one?

I really just don't want
anyone looking at it.

Can we please take it down?

Are you serious?

Take it down.
Hey, it's okay. I'll take it down.

Thank you.

[heartbeat continues]

[no audible dialogue]
[train whistle blows]

That's exactly why
I brought you here,

to prove that your photos are
great, even Julian thinks so.

I don't want this photo
hanging on the wall

of some random stranger.

This is my photo.

That means I get to decide
who I share it with

and I shared it with you.

You're right.

I'm sorry. I should have
asked you first.

I just wanted you to see
how amazing you are.

And that you can
get into RISD.

Who said anything
about RISD?

Shannon said your art teacher
thought you could get in.

I'm gonna kill her.
It is the best art college in the country.

And it's in Providence,
which is in the same city as Brown.

Which if you get in,
we could be together.

I...
For real. Without a ticking clock.

Even if I could
get into RISD,

which I totally doubt,

I cannot afford that.
You're going to get into RISD.

No.
And you could just get a scholarship.

Skylar, Jesus,
just give it up.

This is...
You can't fix everything.

What?

Your parents' marriage
and me.

Some things are
just beyond repair.

Is that why you
won't say you love me?

Because you're...
beyond repair.

Okay.

That's...

[machinery rattling]
[chattering on screen]

[phone chimes]

[knocking on door]
[pop music playing on stereo]

[footsteps approaching]

Hey, 8:00. I'm here
like you asked. What's up?

I would like to take
your portrait.

Uh... can I change first?
No, you don't have to. You can just put that on.

What's that?

It was my mom's.

This really brings me
back to college.

I had a boyfriend who was an art major.
Made me pose for him.

So... Mel isn't the first person
that you've been in love with.

Gosh, no.
I've loved a few men.

Maybe even one woman.

Did you love any of them
more than they loved you?

Oh, probably.

Didn't that scare you?

Knowing that someone could you hurt
you more than you could hurt them?

Yeah. Maybe at first.

But then I think I realized if you
protect yourself from the lows,

you just end up missing
all the highs too.

You love Skylar. Don't you?

I think I'm screwing it up.

Yeah. If it's not opening old
wounds, it's probably not true love.

I just don't
know what to do.

How do I get Skylar
to understand that...

I love him. [chuckles]

You start by saying it.

You need to hear
the words, Tessa.

You mean, he needs
to hear the words.

No. You need to hear
yourself say them.

Out loud.

So the world knows
your feelings count.

That you count.

Vickie, I'm sorry.

For how I've treated you.

Hey Google, dim the lights.

Yes!
Oh, man. No smoke machine?

Shh!

We begin this invocation

by asking the
Archangel Michael

to protect us against
any malevolent spirits

that may be seeking a gateway into this earthbound sphere.
You wrote this?

You're interrupting my invocation.
I'm sorry!

It's just... This is crazy.

Did you read all of
these books in two days?

Bitch, yes! You know speed
reading is my super power.

Enjoy Your Own Funeral.

Yeah. That happens
to be a classic

of the paranormal
metaphysical genre.

Now hush.
Okay.

[pop music playing]

We seek to communicate

only with the disembodies spirit
formerly known as Skylar Adams.

No other spirits, please.

Okay.

A Ouija board?
Please, Tess. This is a planchette.

There's a pencil tip
attached to the bottom.

We ask questions and Skylar
communicates by moving our hands.

Just like he did in the gym.

Here. Fingers right there.

Okay.

Close your eyes.

[gasps] Oh, my God, it moved.
Sorry that was me. My bad.

It's called scrying.
The deceased use the mirror

as a gateway to the world
of the living.

All you have to do is stare into
the mirror in a trance-like state.

That's it.
Okay.

Yeah, I'm sorry.
Can we cover up Gambino and Drake?

They're like really
distracting me.

Instrumental
Trans-Communication.

The spirit uses the TV monitor
as a bridge to our world.

What is this? Okay.
Here you go.

Blocks out the gamma rays.

Do you see anything?

No. Do you?

No.


[both sigh]

Maybe I should have
read more books.

No. No, you've been awesome.

[phone chimes]

It's just Vickie.

Needs the car.
She has a shift.

Okay. I'll walk you out.

Okay.

[faint, high
pitched humming]

[electric warbling]
[voice murmuring]

Hello?

[murmuring continues]

is being calculated.

Proceed for four miles to the
entrance to Highway 85 South.

It's a map.
[door opens, closes]

["Closer" playing]

Tessa? Tessa!

Sorry! I've gotta do this.

Tessa!

[tires screeching]

South, and proceed for 106 miles.

Continue straight
for six miles.

â™ª So come a little closer â™ª

â™ª Come a little closer â™ª

â™ª Come a little closer â™ª

â™ª Come a little closer â™ª

â™ª Don't be shy... â™ª

and in 100 feet,

your destination
will be on your right.

â™ª Closer â™ª

at your destination.

[heartbeat thumping]

â™ª Come a little closer â™ª

â™ª Come a little closer â™ª

I told you he
wasn't gone yet.



You know,
I love coming out here at night

to watch the shooting stars.

My angels are
calling me home.

Skylar knows
the end is near.

You don't have much time.

He's been communicating
with you?

Well, I'm much closer
to his world than you are.


What does he want?

My help.

To bring
the two of you together.

Can you?

Please.

In ancient folklore,
the souls of the departed

returned to places where they experienced
their greatest moments of love.

That's where they were able to
cross the life-death barrier.

Now, perhaps if
you and Skylar went back

to where you felt
the most love,

the window between worlds
might open?

Okay.

But be careful.

If you do manage
to cross the barrier...

there may be no way back.

[hip-hop music playing over speakers]
[teenagers laughing, chattering]

Tess?

What's up?

This is not how I wanted
my summer to go.

Oh, no, what do you mean?
What's wrong?

They're so cute together,
it's stupid.

Who's cute?

Oh. Is that Judd?
[Shannon] That's Judd.

Oh...
My vagina is weeping.

They are cute,
but I'm so sorry.

That's terrible.

Oh, my God!
What?

Billy Hodges
came to my party?

Ciao, Billy.

Hey.
Hey.

just three words.

Hi.

Can we go somewhere
to talk for a second, alone?

Sure.
[both chuckle]

Yo, brutha!
Hey.

[Cortez] I just heard the good news.
What news?

Um...
Oregon State!

Nothing's official yet.
Oh, bullshit, bro.

No, I just talked to the new coach.
He said it's as good as done.

Come on.

Um...
Okay.

Tess? Tess? Tessa?

Tess, I was gonna tell you, I swear.
When?

When were you gonna tell me? After I got into RISD?
No, of course not.

I just didn't want to give you another reason to back out.
What about our plan?

The same city?
No more ticking clock?

You weren't even gonna
send in an application.

I applied last week.

Well, thank you for waiting until
the last possible moment to tell me.


The truth is, Tess,
my dad's not...

He's not doing that well.

He's really lonely in Oregon and I feel
like I should stay with him for awhile.

Oregon is on the other side
of the country.

How were we ever gonna see each other?
It'll be hard.

I'm not switching schools
permanently. I'm not!

And if you get into RISD,
and you will,

I'll be in Providence
before you are.

What happens if you start to like Oregon?
What happens if your team starts to win?

Tess, my dad
needs me right now.

He's my family. I don't...

about family because...

Because I don't have one.

That is not what
I meant to say.

I knew this was
gonna happen.

I get close to people
and they disappear on me.

This is just what
happens to me.

Tess.
No.

No.

You're just gonna push me
away like you do everyone?

The summer is over, Skylar.

And so are we.

[horn honking]

Hey.
Your ghost-hunting assistant has arrived.

Here you go.
Direct from Daddy's closet.

Yeah, this is full spectrum,
motion sensor, night vision.

Perfect. Thank you.

Who gave you all the swag?

Ah, Vickie's credit card.

Whoa! Tessa's a
bad, bad girl.

Bye.
Hey, if there are nudes of my mom on that camera,

I do not want to know.

Shh. I'm gonna tell you.

[seagulls squawking]


[exhales sharply]

[faint, high-pitched hum]


[police radio chatter]

Central, standby.

You Tessa Benson?

I can't believe
you tracked my phone.

The day you stole
Vickie's credit card

was the day you gave up
your right to privacy.

What were you doing at the hotel so late?
I was taking photos.

I told you that.
What, are you trying to put yourself back in the hospital?

I don't understand this.
Things were so much better this summer.

We started to feel like a family.
Do you not understand?

Geez, I wonder what happened at the end
of the summer that might change my mood.

You know what I've been through? What Vickie's been through?
Stop.

Love hurts. You learn to live with it.
Fuck off, Mel.

Hey, no! You don't get
to talk to him like that.

Not after everything he's done for you.
There's no...

Tessa!

[ultrasound warbling]

She's ruptured the repair.

Is it any wonder? The way she's
been running around all crazy.

You can see right here. There's a fair amount
of blood accumulated around her heart.

Will she be all right?
Not until we drain the chamber

and reinforce
the original suture.

We're gonna schedule you for an
OR first thing in the morning.

No, no, I... I'm not... You gotta
let me go. You need to let me go.

Tessa! 50 milligrams now.
[Tessa] Jasmine, no! Don't, please!

Tessa, if I let you go home,
you won't make it through the night.

You don't understand. You don't understand.
Get some rest now, honey.

I never got to tell...
tell him.

Tell him what?

That...

They can never, ever
tear us apart.

["Never Tear Us Apart"
playing]

â™ª Don't ask me â™ª

[song continues on ringtone]

â™ª What you know is true â™ª

â™ª Don't have to tell you â™ª

â™ª I love your
precious heart â™ª

â™ª I â™ª

â™ª I was standing â™ª

â™ª You were there â™ª

Tess?


Are you okay?
You... You sound medicated.

I'm at the hospital.
What happened?

I saw him, Shan.

No way.
At the hotel.

I couldn't touch him,
but he was there.

I just have one place left
that I have to go.

The lake.
Where he told you he loved you.

I just don't really have
much time left.

Okay, stay put. I'm coming.

Whoa.

Now what?
I don't know.

[electrical crackling]

Room 22.
I'll take him.

[chiming]
Oh. Ooh, two more.

[chiming continues]
Witching hour. I'll take odds,

you take evens.
Yeah.

[elevator dings]

Whoa.
Let's go.

I could get used to this.

[elevator dings]

[security guard]
Hey! What are you doing?

Go, go, go.
Come on.

Oh, God.

Whoa. What the hell?

[tires squealing]

The lake is that way.
You've gotta turn around.

I know. I know!
It's the wrong way! Please turn around.

I can't.

Let go.
What?

Let go!

[horns honking]
[both screaming]

[both panting]

I want a dead boyfriend too.

[door opens, closes]

What are you doing here?
Skylar says he's called you and left you a ton of messages.

So?
So? You're ghosting your soul mate?

Shannon, my past is always
just gonna get in the way.

Remember last year,
you'd spotted that condemned bridge

and just had to get a photo.

You had to jump
into the water,

even though it was
freezing cold.

You know what
I was thinking,

when I saw you down there swimming
against the current to get your photo,

"Imagine if Tess could
be like this for her life,

and not just for her art."

He's leaving tonight, Tess.

Lock up for me.

[tires screeching]

[thunder rumbling]

This is where
the accident happened.

Do you know why
he brought you here?

No.

I don't know.

But I'm gonna find out.

Tess?

Tess!

Oh, my God.

I need help!

[line ringing]

911, what's your emergency?

She has a heart condition.

I'm at the corner of 6th and
Channel, please send somebody!


Tess.

You forgot your hat.

I'm so sorry, Sky.

I'm sorry. I'm...

you before making any decisions.

No. You shouldn't have to
explain loving your family.

If I hadn't spent my whole life just pushing
everyone away, I would have understood that.

No, come on, Tess.
I love you.


I said it.

Would you mind
if I said it again?

I love you.

[horn honking]
[Tessa screams]

[Skylar] Hey.
[gasps]

It's you.
It's me.

Oh, my God.

[siren wailing in distance]

I love you.
I know.

You told me.
I love you.

So that's why
you brought me here?

So that I'd know?

Yeah. No regrets.

So, is this...

Is this it?
We're still in Avalon.

Not exactly.

It's like everything
you see is a memory,

a dream that we have,
to project it onto the world.

It's kinda cool.

Come on. I'll show you.

Okay.

[paramedics,
Shannon chattering]

[speaking French]

[speaking French]

[doctors, nurses chattering]

I came out here
the first day I met you.

My parents had just told me
about the separation.

Felt like it was
the worst day of my life.

And then I met you.

And it was probably
the best day of my life.

Mine too.

[Dr. Sarkisian] There's nothing more
we can do. She has a decision to make.

She has to want to live.

Come back, Tess.
Come back, Tess...


Hey.

What's wrong?

I've spent my whole life
learning how not to get hurt.

And that's no way to live.

But... But even with all the
hurt that I feel right now...

I don't regret a thing.

Because I love you.

And knowing that I'm capable
of feeling this way,

makes life worth living.

I don't want
to say goodbye.

You don't have to.

Love never dies.


I'm gonna miss you.

I'm gonna miss you.

Go give us
a happy ending, yeah?

Hey.

No more dying, okay?


Oh, my God.
It smells so good.

Sit down. There's plenty.
I can't. I gotta go.

Good luck, Tessa.
Love you.

Go get 'em.
All right, bye.

See you later!

Ever since I was
a little girl,

people always told me that I see
things that no one else does.

It wasn't just that my camera was
a way for me to express myself.

It was the means by which
I captured the unseen.

It was only recently that I discovered
something that I had been blind to.

A ghost.

All of us,
each and every one of us,

are haunted by ghosts.

The ghosts of
childhood trauma.

The ghosts of
unfulfilled dreams.

The ghosts of lost love.

Like so many people,
I believed that,

if I just ignored
these ghosts,

they would
eventually go away.

This turned out
to be a mistake.

Just like all of
our worst fears,

these invisible spirits
gain strength in darkness.

If we run from them,
they run faster.

If we push them away,
they just push back harder.

What are we supposed to do?

It has taken...

great personal loss

for me to discover the
answer to this question.

We must attend
to our ghosts.

We must welcome them
into our lives

as though they are part of us,
because they are part of us.

It's only when we acknowledge their presence
will they make room for new possibilities.

In the end, I've learned that our
ghosts are part of who we are,

part of who we hope to be.

These hauntings
stay inside us,

tethered to our
hearts forever.

In life.

In death.

And... everywhere
in-between.

â™ª In between
The day and the night â™ª

â™ª In between
The dark and the light â™ª

â™ª In between What's
wrong and what's right â™ª

â™ª I'll find you â™ª

â™ª I'm not really sure
I just work here â™ª

â™ª My heart is broken
And I'm scared â™ª

â™ª Walls are coming down â™ª

â™ª My defense is
on the ground â™ª

â™ª I'm falling â™ª

â™ª In between
The day and the night â™ª

â™ª In between
The dark and the light â™ª

â™ª In between What's
wrong and what's right â™ª

â™ª I'll find you â™ª

â™ª I don't want to lose you
Can't stand the pain â™ª

â™ª I wanna feel the sun
Not always feel the rain â™ª

â™ª Walls are coming down â™ª

â™ª My defense is
on the ground â™ª

â™ª I'm falling â™ª

â™ª In between
The day and the night â™ª

â™ª In between
The dark and the light â™ª

â™ª In between What's
wrong and what's right â™ª

â™ª I'll find you â™ª

â™ª I'll find you â™ª

â™ª I'll find you â™ª

â™ª Forever beside you â™ª

â™ª Beside you â™ª

â™ª I'll find you â™ª

â™ª Breathing inside you â™ª

â™ª I'll find you â™ª

â™ª I'll find you â™ª

â™ª I'll find you â™ª
