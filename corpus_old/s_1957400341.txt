(distant traffic)

(dog barking)

(man sighs heavily)

What's worth fighting for?

What's worth letting go?

Any good story will ask
and answer these questions.

In this book, he
asks what are we all

living for if there's
nothing worth dying for.

(door creaking)

Considering when it was written,

this question carries
great meaning.

Ultimately,

it's the things we value

that end up defining us.

Get out your uh, reflection
sheets from yesterday

and I'll be back
in just a moment.

(rustling books and
chattering students)

(distant chatter
and doors rattling)

Why you?

[Man In Red Shirt]
Come on, Frank.

As section 18 in
your contract states,

North Carolina is an
employment at will state...

I know.

Protesting and
union-like behavior

in a non-union
state results in...

I know.

You knew this would happen!

It didn't have to happen.

Don't act like this
wasn't your decision!

This is you.

I remember sitting in this room

going on and on about all the
things I wanted to do here,

and the first thing
you said to me

was to make sure
I didn't burn out.

Now here we are,
eight years later,

and the last thing I wanna
say to you is I didn't,

but maybe you did.

(pleasant but slightly
melancholic and
reflective guitar)

(approaching clacking footsteps)

(raps on the door)

(door rattles open)

Huh, hey!

How's the divorce goin'?

Goin'.

Gettin' a lawyer's
kind of a drag, huh?

I wouldn't know,
I don't have one.

Have you ever heard
of law of attraction?

Everything good and
bad in your life

you've attracted
with your thoughts.

At first, I thought
these people were trying

to start a cult or sell me on
some kind of a pyramid scheme.

By the way, don't answer
any calls from a Billy.

Have you started dating?

I have.

Liar, I saw you
in the newspaper.

God, I guess that Red For Ed
thing did not work out, huh?

No, not enough people.

I guess I just need to
find something different

for a little while like a uh,

cult or a pyramid
scheme, I don't know.

Well, you haven't asked
me why I've shown up.

I tell you it is not
to give you my sympathy

because I think you are
way better off without her.

It's Oskar, he's
one of my new cases.

You know who he is, right?

No.

OK, how 'bout now?

Her funeral is
tomorrow, Courtland.

Tell me you knew about this.

This is your family!

My family?
[Woman] Yes.

[Courtland] No no no no.

My dad married into all
kindsa families, not me.

OK, then, do me a favor.

This boy, your nephew, he would
like to meet you tomorrow.

So show up.

(Courtland sighs over
peaceful orchestral music)

(serene orchestral
music continues)

[Courtland] I can't do it.

What do you mean
you can't do it?

Just stop, OK,

I, I can't even take
care of myself right now.

Have some compassion.

Compassion, wh, what
do you mean compassion?

I'm, I'm sorry but this kid,

he's as much family to
me as the next random kid

walkin' down the street.

(distant children playing)

I can't do this.

(Scoffs) All I'm
asking is for you

to spend some time with
him before I have to

turn him into an orphan again.

Hello, Miss Kasin?

We're here to see Oskar Satori.

[Miss Kasin] Courtland?

Yeah.

You know, yesterday
was the first time

that I heard Oskar speak,

and he was so excited about
meetin' his uncle Courtland.

Now, I don't know you,

and I don't know
why you didn't show,

but you shoulda been there.

Hey Oskar?

This is Courtland and Sophie.

You remember her?

They're here to hang
out with you today.

Hey Oskar, I'm Courtland.

Miss Sophie tells me that
you're the smartest kid

in the world, is that true?

(birds chirping)

Aquaman, huh?

All right.

That went well.

("Bizness" by Tune-yards)

(crisp rock music with
bright, fluttering vocals)

â™ª If I represent the one
that did this to youâ™ª

He doesn't speak.

Find something he
likes to do and go do it!

Haven't you worked
with kids before?

High school's a
little different.

I know you're not
the self-concerning guy

you're pretending to be,

but if you wanna stop
seeing him, Courtland,

then stop seein' him.

â™ª Beyond, up here
on the mountain

â™ª that I climb to lose you â™ª

[Courtland] (Sighs)
I have to go, Oskar.

Maybe tomorrow, you
can come with me

and look at some comics.

Hey!

Ah, he speaks.

I'm too high.

What?

[Oskar] I'm too high!

You should probably uh,

find a different way
to speak to people.

Please?

You're gonna have to jump.

I can't, get a
ladder or somethin'.

Come on, just do it.

I can't.

(Sighs) You have to jump.

There you go, it's
all right, I gotcha.

(Oskar and Courtland grunt
as the fall to the ground)

Ah, that hurt.
(playful pats)

OK, you can get offa me now.

You OK?

You OK?

(Courtland breathes heavily)

Do you think we
could go today?

I have chronic asthma.

Take two puffs of Albuterol

before exercise
or heavy lifting.

This is my portable,
personal museum.

The things I wanna keep
for my entire life.

[Courtland] Huh.

Some more of those painkillers

for when my carpal
tunnel flares up.

All right.

And I think I have a
defibrillator in the car.

You sure you don't
need anything else?

Don't patronize me.

Gotcha.

â™ª Don't take my life away
don't take my life awayâ™ª

(music fades out)

Thank for catching me.

You're welcome.

Did you know medicine's
the third leading

cause of death in
the United States?

Ah, that can't
possibly be true.

It is.

See, the United States
makes up just five percent

of the world's
population, but it uses up

50 percent of the
world's medicine.

That's impressive.

So you listen to music
when you're ridin'

in the car, or what?

Books on tape.

[Courtland] No music?

I know Queen.

Wait a minute, you
like Freddy Mercury?

No, at my old foster home,

they made us learn
to play instruments,

learned Queen songs.

What instruments?

[Oskar] Piano.
[Courtland] Ah,

[Courtland] that's great.

I hate piano.

Hey, Oskar, com'ere.

Take a look at that.

(Sighs) Loses his left arm
and replaces it with harpoon.

Four out of five.

Four out of five?

It's my review.

You see any you'd
like to take home?

Really?

(rustling pages and comic books)

All right, you're all set.

Can I have the receipt?

Why, you wanna
return those already?

Just give it to me.

(Courtland chuckles)

Can you sign it?

(pen scrawling)

(twangy blues music)

My family tree is a mess.

(Scoffs) No kidding,
it's like a family forest.

Did you know medicine
is the third leading

cause of death in the U.S.?

I didn't (laughs).

This kid's like a
goddamn encyclopedia.

I know!

Are you sure about this?

Yeah.

Yeah, this is the way
teaching used to be for me.

Not to be a cheese ball but,

I feel an aliveness like,

there's a purpose to
something I'm doin'.

You like this kid, huh?

I wanna see him set up right.

(Sighs) K, Oskar's
in what we call

a dual licensing program.

You're not the fostering
parent, but this allow you

temporary custody until we
find the right home for him,

and I'll be with you off and on.

Unfortunately, there
isn't a relative on here

that's of higher
interest than you,

but given Oskar's age,

this does allow him
more of a choice.

OK.

OK.

Are you absolutely
sure about this?

Yeah.

(indistinct chatter
amongst patrons)

You know, there's like
zero protein in olives.

So all these people want me.

[Courtland] They do.

Some of these people
are my aunts and uncles.

[Courtland] Sorta.

You're my uncle?

Sorta.

Your granddad was, um, was just,

our family's just
really twisty is all.

Something wrong?

They're gonna be phony.

What, like all of 'em?

Hi cutie, how ya doing?

Aw, Oskar, he's so precious!

Houses are gonna
be cleaned to a T.

It's gonna smell
like fresh laundry,

we're gonna eat at the
table they never eat at,

and the lawn's gonna be mowed.

Mm-hmm, is your
name Oskar Satori

or Holden Caulfield,
I can't remember.

Come on, buddy, it's
not gonna be that bad.

It's gonna be
exactly that bad.

How 'bout this.

We're not supposed to
be there till tomorrow.

So what d'you say we go a
day early, and that way,

we get to know who
these people really are

in their real lives and
surprise these bastards.

(pleasant, rhythmic rock music
with offbeat guitar accents)

You know whatchu want?

[Oskar] Ice cream.

What kinda family do you want?

Someone with ice cream.

I don't know.

Do you think I'm a mistake?

I, I don't think
anybody's a mistake.

Do you think my mother
didn't want to have me?

Where do these
questions come from?

You're her brother.

You know, buddy,
I only knew your mom

for a very short
period of time, so uh,

you know, I'm not that
familiar with her mistakes.

But, I think life's
about choices

and a lot of 'em are
already made for us.

But, it's the ones that
we can make for ourselves

that make it interesting.

Oh, gosh.

[Courtland]
Everything all right?

I guess.

Arright, look at it this way.

Nobody gets to
choose their family,

but you do.

That is so phony.

(car comes to a stop)

Hey,

hey, Oskar?

Do you need your inhaler?

[Oskar] I'm fine.

[Courtland] You sure?

I'm fine.

How 'bout we make a new rule.

If either one of us feels
uncomfortable for any reason,

we say Mercury, that
way the other person

knows it's time to go.

Whatta ya think?

Yeah?

Yeah.

K.

Whatever you're selling,
we've already found God,

and heard the good news.
(door slams)

Mercury.

(raps on the door)

Just kidding, how's it goin'?

So, you Jehovah's
Witness or salesman?

(Laughs) He's just kidding.

Take your shoes off, come on in!

[Courtland] All right.

[Man In Striped
Shirt] Oh yeah...

Not, not on the rug, you
wanna put them on that side.

You got it.

Home owner's association,
rules and stuff...

I'm Courtland.

[Man In Striped Shirt] Colin.

[Woman] Hi, I'm Theresa.

This is Oskar.
[Theresa] Hello, Oskar!

[Theresa] He's not talking.
[Colin] It's OK.

[Colin] We'll make him talk.

Well, this is a
pleasant surprise!

Did we have the wrong
day or something?

No, we're early.

Oh, and that's legal?
[Colin] Honey!

[Theresa] OK, OK.

We're glad you're here,
although if we had known

you were coming, we woulda
cleaned up a little.

(Colin chuckles and
groans as he sits down)

Oh!
(Theresa pats couch)

(Colin laughs)

So, uh, tell us a little

about yourself, Oskar Satori.

What do you like?

(clocking ticking)

(Colin chuckles)

(Colin mumbles and groans)

He likes art, he's really good

at drawing, super-talented.

[Colin] Mmm.

(clock ticking)

Brewski?
[Courtland] Thanks.

[Colin] You're
supposed to jump on it.

He's just checkin' it out.

That thing's brand new, man.

love brand new things.

I mean, the smell,
the potential.

It's all there.

wrong with him?

I'm sorry, what?

He's gotta have
some kinda illness.

He's basically a
crack baby, right?

Theresa wanted to
adopt, but I was like,

he's my family, you know.

Aren't you somehow related
to this whole mess, too?

[Courtland]
Yeah, yeah I guess.

Yeah.

Nothin' a little medicine
won't fix, right?

I mean, he's not one of those,

"I'm gonna kill you in
your sleep"-type kids,

is he?

(insects chirping)

(silverware and plates rattling)

So I was just
wondering, Oskar,

what um, just hypothetically,
for your room.

Um,

we were thinking you could
pick your bedroom color.

The accent wall, of course,
but we were thinking

between a taupe,

a light beige, or
a dark cream color.

What are your thoughts?

[Colin] We use that
eggshell paint, doesn't show

dirt and stuff like that.
[Courtland] Oh!

[Courtland] It's
good stuff, eggshell.

[Colin] Yep.

So that's somethin'
you can decide,

just when everything works out.

Cross that bridge
when we get to it.

[Colin] Oh, right, yeah.
[Theresa] Yeah.

[Colin] Absolutely.
[Theresa] Of course.

[Theresa] You
can wait on that,

it's more um, the bed
we were concerned about.

Do you like bunk beds?

Make a fort out of 'em.

It's just Thomasville
wants their orders

six months in advance because
they're custom, you know.

We just, we'd want
it to be a safe and...

American furniture.
[Theresa] Neat as possible.

[Theresa] Yes, yes, American,
buy American (laughs).

It just, you have to wait
a while for the order,

so while you're
thinking about it,

I can always cancel it, but.

[Colin] Bunk beds are fun!

[Theresa] He's gonna sleep
on it, he'll sleep on it.

Well, they weren't
absolutely terrible.

What did ya think?

2 out of five.
[Courtland] Oh yeah?

[Oskar] Don't be so
phony all the time.

I wasn't bein' phony!

Oh Oskar, he loves art,

he's so precious!

Arright, arright!

Why only two?

'Cause I'd rather
live in a hole

in the wall than live there.

[Courtland] Why's that?

Then I wouldn't have to
be so worried all the time.

What if I spilled some
food on the carpet,

or made our couches dirty,

or forgot to put my
napkin in my lap?

I'm clumsy and I kinda
like being clumsy.

You do?

Yeah, first thing I'll
do when I buy a house

is put a big
scratch on the wall.

That way, I won't
have to be so worried

about keepin' things new.

I hate new things.

Arright, well
listen up, Picasso.

There's nothin' wrong with
people having new things, OK?

Whatever.

[Voiceover] One of
those little English jobs

that can do around
200 miles an hour.

Cost him damn near 4000 bucks.

Chapter seven, a tiny bit
of light came through...

(rhythmic and twangy guitar
drowns out audio book dialog)

Oh, God.

[Courtland] C'mon, bud.
(door latch rattling)

Can we help ya'll?

I believe so.

[Man With Glasses]
Child locks, huh?

[Courtland] Hey,
I'm Courtland.

Good to see ya, Courtland.
[Courtland] This is Oskar.

[Man With Glasses]
Oskar, Oskar Satori Oskar?

[Courtland] Yeah,
that's the one.

I'll be, now I don't think

we were expecting ya'll
till tomorrow, though.

[Courtland] Yeah
um, is that a problem?

Heavens no, no no, come on in.

[Courtland] Hey bud.
[Man With Glasses] Wow!

[Man With Glasses] Nice to
finally meet you, Oskar Satori.

Hope, your mother, was my
second cousin twice removed.

Or was it once removed, I'm
not quite sure (chuckles),

but Aunt Louise always
spoke highly of her.

I met her once at a family
reunion up in Goldsborough.

You remember that, don'tcha Jim?

Was that the buffet?

[Woman] Oh my dear Lord!

He is always so positive.
(Jim chuckles)

I, I gotta ask, um,

what possessed you to
collect all this stuff?

Well, you know,
we like to remember.

In fact, we love it.

Too many people today give
the past a bad name, y'know?

It's always brought
me great pleasure

to remember the things
I've done in life,

like marry this good
woman here (chuckles).

Well, my father and I built
this place when I was young.

It's never had a
second owner, just us.

Well,

this is uh,

this is really somethin'.

So, who have you seen
from the family so far?

Just Colin and Theresa.

[Jim] Who?

Oh you know who they are, Jim.

They're from Aunt
Louise's second marriage.

Oh (chuckles).
[Woman] Or was it her third?

[Jim] With the plastic-covered
couches, oh my God!

And they wanted us to
take our shoes off.

I mean, what the world!
(Jim chuckles)

Weird people, really.
[Woman] Mmm, Jim!

[Courtland] Oh, that's them.
[Jim] Yeah (chuckles).

[Courtland] Ya'll
have kids of your own?

I'm sorry, I didn't...

No, Walt,

Walt died last year,

just after the Town Hall
Festival in October.

I'm very sorry to hear that.

No, don't worry.

Uh, there's no way
you coulda known.

Maybe ya'll could
come back another day.

Would that work?

Yeah, yeah of course, thanks.

[Jim] Enjoyed meetin' ya.

[Courtland] Thanks
for everything.

Yes, sir, nice meetin' ya'll.

Hey hey, hold up now, big man.

I almost forgot, I wanna
give you somethin'.

I want you to have this.

I originally got this
for your Aunt Donna,

and she didn't take
to it real good.

I want you to have this.

Now, whenever somethin'
happens in life, Oskar,

before you judge it
to be good or bad,

I want you to read
this inscription here.

I know it's helped
me out a lot before.

It'll kinda remind ya of the
way that the world works.

Thank you.

You got it.

Thanks again.

Enjoyed meetin' ya'll.

Well, I didn't think
they were phony, did you?

What's it say?

This too shall pass.

Mmm.

So, why Aquaman?

What?

You have like
100 Aquaman comics.

He's got an ill reputation.

He's trying to find
his true purpose

beyond his public side,

as a deposed king
and a fallen hero.

27 and a half.

27 and a half what?

[Oskar] Aquaman comics.

That's how many I have.

You have a half a comic?

My mom got me a Suicide Squad.

Aquaman was only in half of it.

Whatta you remember
about your mom?

If you don't wanna talk
about it, I understand.

She used to play chess
by herself, like I do.

[Courtland] You play
chess by yourself?

Yeah.

You ever won?

[Oskar] Never lost.

What do you know
about my mother?

Your grandmother was only
married to my dad for two years.

Hope was in college,
I was teachin',

so I didn't see her very much.

Remember anything she said?

No, not really.

I used to think
learning to play the piano

would impress her when she'd
finally come to see me.

different I was or something.

Now, I guess I just need
to forget about her.

[Courtland] If you could
be any piece on the board,

what would you be?

Pawn maybe.

A pawn, why would
you wanna be a pawn?

Pawn's simple,

all the other pieces
seem so complicated.

Hey guys!
[Courtland] Hey!

[Courtland] You know,
my dad used to say

that chess was the game of life

where every move
has its consequence,

and all the pieces divide class

from the lowly pawn
to the king and queen.

And then I realized that
at the end of the game,

all the pieces wind
up in the same box.

Checkmate.

I get it, you're one of those.

I'm one of what?

People who can't
talk after they lose.

People who can't
talk after they lose.

Set 'em up again.

Can I see you outside?

Yeah Courtland, can
she see you outside?

This guy.

Set it up again.

Play a little tune on
the piano while you wait.

What's goin' on?

14 cases, Courtland, 14!

And I thought one of
them would go right.

What are you talkin' about?

What am I talkin'
about, are you kiddin' me?

These home visits are
supposed to be comfortable.

An entire day early, really?

Huh, why don't you ask Oskar

if he feels slighted
by any of this?

'Cause he doesn't have
a say in any of this.

You're his guardian, Courtland,
stop being his friend!

(birds chirping and
insects buzzing)

(raps on the door as
wind chime jangles)

(raps on the door and
distant metallic clanging)

I think I hear
someone back there.

Let's go check it out.

(metallic clanging
and woman muttering)

[Woman] Oh dangit!

[Courtland] Mary?
[Mary] Courtland!

[Courtland] Wow.

Wh, what are you doing here?

It's Wednesday, shouldn't
you be teaching?

No, no, I'm, I'm
hangin' out with this guy.

Oh, hey precious.

So um, Oskar,

you should know
that Courtland and I

used to teach together,

and anything he has
ever told you not to do

is probably because he's
already done it himself.

He has closed more
doors in his life

than anyone I know (laughs).

So, tell me about yourself,
I've been dying to meet you.

You have?
[Mary] Of course.

[Oskar] Why
aren't you married?

[Mary] Excuse me?
[Courtland] Oskar!

[Mary] No, no, it's fine.

Um, marriage just hasn't been

in the cards for
me yet, that's all.

You know, you can't
resist what is.

Why do you want
me to be your son?

Well, I felt like the universe

asked me to look after you.

How does it do that?

By bringing you
into my awareness.

You know, we are not the
thoughts that we have,

but the awareness behind them.

Once you've experienced
living in the now,

you'll understand it too.

Are you a hippie?

(Laughs) Hippie, no.

I don't identify
myself with form.

Hey, let's try something fun.

(metallic clang)

OK, get into position like I am.

(meditative Eastern music
with tabla percussion)

(Mary breathing
deliberately over music)

Ha-ah!

Our minds are all that we have,

and all that we
can give to others.

Be still!

Know all unhappiness is never
to do with a bad situation,

but the thoughts about it.

The stillness reminds
us that true presence

is real.

(Mary inhales heavily
before moaning and exhaling)

OK, you can open your eyes now.

OK, wasn't that wonderful?
(Courtland moans contentedly)

It's like a warm bath.

How did that feel?

It was nice, right?

[Courtland] Yeah.
[Mary] Do you feel good?

[Courtland] Do you feel it?
(playful slap)

I feel it.

Good.

You don't think so?

Hah, oh,

your mother is
very proud of you.

Now listen, you
just keep on smiling

even when it seems
impossible, OK?

But it's great seeing you.
[Courtland] Yeah, oh!

[Mary] Oh, I know you're
not much of a hugger.

Namaste, namaste.
[Courtland] Namaste.

[Courtland] Let's go.
[Mary] Bye.

[Oskar] So, you're a teacher?

I was.

Do you get paid good money?

(Laughs) Did you really
just say, "good money?"

My mom said people who work

at a desk all day
make good money.

Teachers have desks.

I guess I
understand her logic.

When I grow up, I wanna
do something important.

[Courtland] What's
important to ya?

Saving the world.

How you gonna do that?

I don't know, recycling.

Why are we pulling over?

What do you wanna do?

[Oskar] What?

What do you like doing?

OK, when you think
of it, do that.

Don't worry about anything else.

My mother didn't
like being a waitress.

Sometimes people have to
find love in what they're doing

if they can't do what
they love already.

You just have to
avoid gettin' stuck.

Think I could be
a comic book artist?

I think you could be anything,

as funny as that sounds,

but I already know
what you wanna be.

Tell me.

A piano player.

(both chuckle)

Keep your eyes closed,
take a few steps in.

Come on, come on, you're
good, you're good.

Stop right there.

Can I open 'em now?

No, you can not.

Wait right there,
here, keep 'em closed.

Have a seat,
arright, just a sec.

Can I open 'em?
[Courtland] Not yet.

[Courtland] No peekin'.

Are they closed?

Arright, take a look.

It's a little messy, but.

Who's that?

[Courtland] That's my wife.

[Oskar] You're married.

[Courtland] I was.

[Oskar] So you're not anymore.

No, I'm not.

What was it like
being married?

It was very difficult

and special all
at the same time.

So why aren't you
married anymore?

Is she dead?

No, she's not dead.

Then why aren't you married?

How 'bout somethin' to eat?

You like sandwiches?

Let's see what we got.

(Courtland grunts)

Cozy enough?

You like it here?
[Oskar] Yeah.

[Courtland] Good.

Courtland?
[Courtland] Yeah.

[Oskar] Will you
still come see me

after we found a home?

Of course, g'night.

(door creaking closed)

(phone buzzing and beeping)

Mom, someone's here.

Mom, someone's here!

(knocking on door)

Can I help you?

I'm sorry about the mess,

I wasn't expecting you
guys until tomorrow.

No, Jake!

Taylor, just...

It's my iPad.

Come back here, now!

[Taylor] I'm doing
my outside time.

You're gonna lose that phone!

Anything to drink?

Water's fine, thank you.

(woman struggling to lift boy)

So, is David around as well?

Um, he had to go
into the office today.

On a Sunday?

On everyday (laughs),

but he should be
back soon, though.

You guys know you're
a day early, right?

Yeah, sorry about that.

We were just in the
neighborhood and uh,

Oskar just couldn't wait.

The last time I saw
her was at my wedding.

She was eight months
clean, I think, at the time

and she still had
the rights to Oskar,

but we knew it
wouldn't be for long.

(Sighs) Do uh, do you know
anything about the father?

I'm just tryin' to
give him an idea...

Hope had just
called Dave and I

to cancel dinner plans.

Said she had a date.

Later that evening,
she called back,

very calm,

and said

something bad happened.

When we went to find her,

Dave tried to get
her to come back,

but she could hardly form words.

He took pictures of the guys,

but they just broke his phone

and threw him to the ground.

When we got Oskar's
letter about his adoption,

I felt like I had to do it.

Yeah.

We struggled with
it for a while, but

I think Dave's come around.


(door creaks and opens)
[Taylor] Daddy!

[Dave] Hey there, little one,

how're you doin'?
[Taylor] Good.

[Dave] Good, did
you have a good day?

[Taylor] Yes.
[Dave] You did?

[Dave] Did you
behave for mommy?

[Taylor] Yes.

[Dave] Oskar, what
are you interested in?

He's into uh...

I'm not really sure yet.
[Courtland] Oh.

[Dave] Well, surely
there's something.

Kinda wanna learn
everything about everything.

Why don't we have the TV on?

Honey, Oskar was talking.

[Oskar] I don't know if that's
possible, but I wanna try.

[Woman] That is
like music to my ears.

(all chuckle)

Well, I wanna tell
you something, Oskar,

technological engineering,
now that's the next big thing.

So, sooner you learn
how to code, the better.

I need the parental password.

Not right now.

Like drawing, don't
know if I'm any good,

but I like it.
[Woman] Great!

[Woman] Can we see something?

I don't usually
show them to people.

[Woman] OK.

Would, would you
make me play the piano?

(all laugh)

What?

At my old foster home,

they made us learn
to play the piano.

I hate piano.

No way, however, we do
have outside time, right?

I mean, we just want you
guys to get some vitamin D,

but, other than that,
we're pretty easy goin'.

It was so nice
to meet you, Oskar.

Keep drawin', buddy.

Oh, food was great.

Nice to meet you.

Yeah, thanks for everything.

All right, buddy, let's review.

What'd you think about
that house yesterday

with Dave and Rebecca,
the iPad kids?

Kinda liked them.

Arright, four out of five?

Three.

[Courtland] What
makes them better?

[Oskar] I dunno, I
felt like they liked me.

Why don't you want
anybody lookin' at your art?

[Oskar] Please
don't call it art.

My bad, your drawings.

If they tell me I'm good,

I'll just think
they're being polite,

and if they say it sucks,

well, I'll just think it sucks.

People are too phony
to see my work.

Yeah, maybe
you're just a little

too much in your head.

[Oskar] Whatta you mean?

You seem to care an awful lot

about what other
people think of it.

What do you think?

How am I supposed to
know, I'm the one making it.

Yeah, but you're the only one

who gets to decide when
it's finished, right?

So until then, why
can't I see it.

'Cause it's for you.

(pleasant, breezy
light rock music)

not to get your hopes up,

and I really hate that.

Why?
[Oskar] I don't know.

[Oskar] It just makes
me feel depressed.

Eh, when people say that,
it's because they've created

a life that prepares
them for failure

rather than its alternative.

Well, that sucks.

Yeah, you don't have to
be a part of that life.

Who's been tellin' you this?

Other kids, teachers.

Told me they liked my drawings,

but not to get my hopes up.

So really, they're just
saying it's not good enough.

Maybe it really does suck.

Hey, did I ever tell you I
got to meet Maurice Sendak?

Where the Wild Things Are?

[Courtland] Among
other books, yep.

[Oskar] What'd he say?

He told me how they
became wild things.

He did?
[Courtland] Yep.

[Oskar] Well, tell me.

No, I don't think
you really wanna know.

Come on!
[Courtland] OK, OK.

[Courtland] Just calm
down and stop yelling,

you're embarrassing me.
[Oskar] I'm not yelling!

[Courtland] All right!

OK, so I say,

"'Ey, Maurice," and
he looks at me like...

You called him Maurice?

Yeah, that's his name.

Somebody's named Maurice,
you gotta talk to 'em

in Italian accent likea dis.

So listen, I say,
"Hey, why wild things?"

And he grabs my
shoulder and he says,

"Courtland,

"I actually drew horses.

"What you saw in my
book were horses."

"It was supposed to be called
Where the Wild Horses Are,

"but the truth is, I can't
draw a goddamn horse."

Nice language!

What did she say?

Nothin', she's just
bein' a nosy parker.

My point is, I think
you got the upper hand.

How so?

Just, you've been
lookin' at it all wrong.

You are so good
at being original

that nobody else can
even think like you.

You don't wanna be
like anyone else.

If you were, I wouldn't
hang out with ya.

I mean, you wouldn't
even be cool enough

to hang out with me.

You're an original
and it's cool.

(pleasant strumming guitar)

(Oskar and Courtland
breathing heavily)

Hey, I'm supposed to be the
only one who's winded here.

(slapping hands)

Why don't you hug people?

What?

People have been
tryin' to hug you.

Do you know that?

Where do these
questions come from?

Are you really not a
hugger, like Mary said?

Why do you hug people?

'Cause it's my way of
saying thank you and goodbye.

Yeah well, maybe my
dad wasn't such a hugger.

Or, maybe I don't know how.

See, try to hug me.

Eh, uh.

C'mon.

(raps on door)

Forget some,

can I help you?

Yeah, I'm Courtland and
this is my buddy Oskar.

Hope's son.

Right, right, yeah, I'm Gary.

Um, did I get the days mixed up?

No, no, we're, we're early.

Oh, come in then.

You know, Victoria won't
be back until tomorrow.

So, why are you so early?

We just wanted to see
[Courtland] We...

[Oskar] Who people really
are in their normal lives.

Yeah, well, why don't
we, why don't we head out

and get some burgers
somewhere, yeah?

OK.
[Gary] Yeah, all right?

[Gary] All right, let
me go get my wallet, OK?

Sounds good.

[Oskar] Kinda like it here.

Hey Oskar, wanna see a
picture of your mother?

Who's this?

Think that's your Aunt
Victoria, Gary's wife.

Uh, where's Gary?

Uh...

[Oskar] Hi, I'm Oskar.

I forgot my purse.

(clacking footsteps and
Gary sighing heavily)

Can we slow down?

Why are we leaving,
what about the burgers?

Why isn't Gary coming with us?

Hey.

I need you to do
something for me, OK?

No matter what happens,
I want you to promise me

you'll always keep
your promises.

Fine, I promise.

All right, let's go.

Still forcing it.

[Courtland] What do
you mean, I'm forcing it?

You gotta commit.

[Courtland] I am!

[Oskar] Choose a side
and tilt your head.

Oh, OK, here we go.

Like this?

[Oskar] You did it!
(Courtland laughs)

All right, yes.

Good job, good job.
(pats against tree)

I think me and this guy
are gonna be good buddies.

(jar opening)

Why do married
people fight so much?

(Shrugs) I don't know.

My old foster
parents argued a lot.

[Courtland] I bet that sucked.

Did your wife argue with you?

I wouldn't say
she argued with me.

We argued with each other.

[Oskar] Why'd you do that?

That's a good
question, my friend.

Um, I don't know, I think that

a lot of times it's about money,

but you know, for us,

we argued a lot about timing.

[Oskar] What do
you mean, timing?

She was just ready
for certain things

that I wasn't quite ready for.

[Oskar] What was her name?

[Courtland] Tara.
[Oskar] Tara.

[Courtland] Mm-hmm.

[Oskar] Like the earth.

Yeah, Tara like the earth.

Sculptor.
[Oskar] Creator.

[Courtland] Uh, lawyer.
[Oskar] Arguer.

[Courtland] Psychiatrist.
[Oskar] Listener, no.

[Oskar] Uh, friend.
[Courtland] Teacher.

[Oskar] Inspirer.
[Courtland] I like that.

[Courtland] I'm an inspirer.

[Oskar] No, uh, someone
who helps you pass a test.

Dangit, I don't have a one
word down for that one.

You could give me an
answer for anything, huh?

I know the difference between
anything and everything.

Oh yeah?

See, I was just thinking
about this last night.

Anything is broader in
its negative connotation.

For example, I
don't want anything,

where as I don't want
everything implies

that you still might
want something.

[Courtland] Uh-huh.
[Oskar] Who's that?

[Courtland] Hey.

Hey Oskar, I'm
Pierce Williams,

why don't you come with me?

[Sophia] Honey, it's OK,
you can go with Mr. Williams.

[Courtland] What's
going on here?

Theresa and Colin
Gearhart are taking custody.

What are you talking about?

We haven't even seen the
rest of the families yet.

Well, their
attorneys made a case

that they have more rights.

What's wrong, this'll
be good for him.

I dunno, I just thought

he'd have more of
a choice in this.

Yeah, look, it's unfortunate
that they lawyered up,

but I went to the
house yesterday.

I think it'll be a good fit.
(Courtland scoffs)

Courtland?

(dramatic, slightly
uneasy piano)

[Oskar] Mercury.

Please, Mercury!

[Courtland] Oskar, I...

[Oskar] We're
breaking the rules!

I wanna go home with you!
(car latch rattling)

Buddy, I don't think there's
anything we can do here.

Oskar, open the door!

Hey, I know you're up
front listening to me.

Open the door!

(car door opens and slams shut)

This way, sir.

We don't have time
for this today.

(dramatic, slightly
haunting piano)

Oskar Satori is now
up for legal adoption.

We have court papers with the
decision about their rights.

With these sort of things, we
feel like this with a child,

that we should put our
complete attention to.

(Courtland scoffs)

Now, we do appreciate the
volunteering and hard work

and efforts by Mr.
Courtland, but at this time,

we are now terminating
the guardianship contract.

Why?
[Sophie] Courtland!

[Pierce] What
do you mean, sir?

What was the point?

We just thought
that Oskar should...

This is bullshit.

[Theresa] Let's keep it down.

Excuse me?

No no no, if this man
can just walk in here

and make snap decisions based
on no evidence of his own,

and certainly not
mine, for that matter,

somebody please tell
me what is the point?

There is a process,
Mr. Courtland...

Yeah, well you need to
review your fucking process

because it's shitty and
in complete disregard

of this child that
we're supposed

to be focusing our attention on.

We will not have
any of that in here!

Sophie, it is time to
ask Mr. Courtland to leave.

[Courtland] I am not leaving.

Shall we go over
the legal troubles

that the Gearhart's were willing

to subside for your behavior?

[Theresa] Yes,
you ungrateful...

My behavior?

Colin here thinks that he's
about to adopt a crackhead

that's gonna kill him in
the middle of his sleep.

(Sophie gasps)

[Theresa] He did not say that.

He never said that.

Are you sure you
wanna adopt this kid

who's gonna fuck up your
pretty little couches

with their plastic covers?
(Oskar slams table)

(door slams)

Oskar!

(ominous droning tones)

(crunching and rustling
brush over droning ambiance)

(both huffing and puffing)

I want my mom back.

I know.

Did she run away?

What?

It's OK if she did,
'cause I'll go find her.

No, Oskar,

she was very sick.

How do you know?

Maybe they're just saying that.

Maybe the whole world's phony.

Everybody's lying to everybody.

(Courtland breathing heavily)

What are you still doing here?

Just a waste of
your time, remember?

This is not your fault, OK?

You're such a liar!

Hey.

This is where you need to be.

It may not be what you want,

it's not what I'd want,

but this is where you
should be right now.

I'll still come see
ya all the time.

I said Mercury and
you didn't take me back!

You're supposed to take me back.

[Courtland] I
know, man, I know.

Told me to always
keep my promises,

and you can't even keep yours!

(fading footsteps
through the brush)

Phew.

Well uh, thanks for
bringin' him back in.

You mind me comin'
by and seeing him?

We can talk about that later.

There's nothin' wrong
with that kid in there.

Hey!

I don't know what else
you were expecting,

but I greatly appreciate you
spending time with Oskar.

(Courtland sighs heavily)

There's gotta be
somethin' else we can do.

What?
[Courtland] He hates them.

[Courtland] He's gonna be
disappointed and confused

for the rest of his life.

And what family
would prevent that?

I just don't think we did
everything we could for him.

Courtland, that's
all there is...

All there is?

That's not enough.

Hey, sit!

My job is to find the best homes

for orphans, that's it.

All these potential
families that I visit,

they don't know what
the hell they're doing.

None of us do, we're
all just guessing,

and every single family
has their own normal

and they make the best
guess with what to do

based on what their parents did,

which was based on
what their parents did

and nobody knew what they
were doing the whole time.

They just did it!

That's life.

You should give
that speech to Oskar.

You're really good
at what you do.

(Sophie sighs)

(clanging church bell)

You're gonna ruin that
brand new suit, Oskar.

Hey, hey hey!

Oskar, stop stop stop, what the.

What's wrong?

It's OK, buddy.

It's OK.

14th annual career day.

We all excited
about the job fair?

We have an overuse of the word
jobs in our society today.

When people start creating
jobs to create other jobs

but all that ever does
is create the same thing

over and over again,
then we are feeding

directly into the collective
insanity of human beings.

So when you're
lookin' around today,

please be aware that
most of these jobs

are neither creative,
nor necessary.

We have insurance companies
for insurance companies.

Some people might say,
"Well, our economy would fail

"if we got rid of some of these
so-called unnecessary jobs."

Maybe, but we all
need to be wary

when it is the system
we protect from failing

rather than the way of life the
system is supposed to serve.

Mr. Courtland?
[Courtland] Joseph?

[Joseph] What if we don't
know what we're supposed to do?

Supposed to do,
whatta you mean?

Well, you make
us read these books

about lost characters
and celebrate it.

Like we should be lost too.

But the truth is,
I hate being lost.

Mm-hmm.

I'm not saying you
should be lost.

I'm saying it's OK to be lost.

This isn't a
mathematical equation

where your age constitutes
life's next big event.

Travel, go to college,
fail, drop out,

change your mind,
go back to college.

It's all OK, live!

Your life isn't supposed
to be a certain way

at a certain time.

What are you afraid
of, right now?

Isn't it obvious?

(Courtland shrugs)

(clock ticking)

Right now, each of you

has the chance

to become a master
at what you love

and make a living doing so.

So when it comes to work,

find something you'd do
if money were no object.

And when it comes to life,

never miss a single moment.

[Shopkeeper] Hey,
what's goin' on, man?

[Courtland] Hey, not much.

[Shopkeeper] These
gonna do it for ya?

[Courtland] Yeah.
[Shopkeeper] All right.

[Shopkeeper] Be $27.95
after taxes and discounts.

[Courtland] Put
it on that, please.

[Shopkeeper] Thank you, sir.

(raps on door)

I have to see him.

Courtland, now
is not a good time.

[Courtland] I just need
to say something to him.

I can deliver the message.

Look, it's just, he's
getting used to a routine,

and now is just not
a good time, OK?

(Theresa sighs heavily
and door slams)

Courtland!

Oskar?
(video game bloops)

Oskar?

Hey.

I am calling the police.

Are you OK?

(video game noise continues)

I like your new room.

Where's your sketchbook?

[Oskar] Gone.

Whatta ya mean gone?

Why weren't you
at the funeral?

It was in the paper, so
don't tell me your forgot.

No, buddy,

I'm sorry.

I was looking for you.

Mom told me you were the
only person in the world

she wanted me to grow up with.

So why weren't you there?

She is your sister.

I don't really
have a good reason.

That's why I'm here now.

I wanna be a part of your life,

even if it's just
a weekend thing.

[Oskar] Don't you get it?

Everyone I love abandons me.

Oskar, I'm not
gonna abandon you...

You ran away!

[Courtland] Hey,
that's not true!

Get out!
[Courtland] C'mon, buddy!

[Courtland]
Don't be like that!

Arright, arright, I'm leavin'.

Leave!
(door slams)

(dramatic, slightly
haunting piano music)

Wait!

(pleasant and reassuring guitar)

Wait!

(pleasant and reassuring guitar)

This is all kinda phony,

'cause you'll never read this.

I'm not so sure about
heaven or God or any of it.

I'm not so sure about anything,

but neither is anyone
else and that's all right.

I forgive you for leaving me.

I don't think I'll be able
to call this place home,

but I know I'll be OK.

(pleasant, flowing guitar)

C'mon, we're gonna miss it!

[Courtland] All
right, let's go.

Arright buddy, let's go!
