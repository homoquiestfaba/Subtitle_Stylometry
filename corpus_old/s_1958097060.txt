Remember me.

I live within you

in absolute stillness

waiting.

Have you forgotten?

Have you placed me
outside of yourself?

Far beyond your reach?

I am here

within you.

Close as breath.

I always have been.

I always will be.

Find me.

You are me.

We have descended from realms

beyond our human memory.

Our birthright is to return.

The truth of who we are

lives deep within us

In absolute stillness

waiting for us to respond

to the calling
of a deeper memory.

The journey of awakening

to our own eternal adventure

begins

with the Birth

of Innocence.

There is only life

and life is forever.

An ever expanding,
dynamic continuum

always in a state of change.

Life is a force

imbued with love.

Its natural momentum is joy.

Moving through everything

everyone

everywhere

in both seen and unseen aspects

of all creation.

Nature moves in rhythm
with this force.

Alive with power.

Alive with change.

Alive in stillness.

Nature's power
is in its stillness.

Our power
is in our stillness.

In our stillness

we dream.

We form a vision of our desire.

We enact our will through focus.

Our own creative power

infusing our dream with life.

Nature reminds us

to create our dream

with passion and purpose.

To give ourselves
wholeheartedly

until our experience
of our dream

becomes our life.

We are free to change.

Free to experience
new unknowns

new dreams

new life.

Sowing our dreams like seeds,

we gain experience.

We harvest wisdom.

Moving in rhythm
with our own life force

we experience the potency
of cycles.

We experience our own joy.

When trusting our nature

to dream

to experience

to gain wisdom and move on

we are in harmony with life.

Our love for life grows greater

and greater

inspiring us
to become one with life.

To dream bold
and outrageous dreams.

We dissolve everything we are

everything we have known.

A death without dying.

A birth into a whole new being.

A genetic leap

into the vast unknown.

In choosing to make this dream

our reality

we ride the mystery

of our own deep stillness.

There is only life

and life is forever.

Our gateway to forever

lives deep within us

in absolute stillness

waiting.

Have we forgotten?

You do?

<i>No, I don't, but she wanted</i>
<i>the tomatoes, so I was very</i>

<i>nice to trade</i>

-Oh, alright--
<i>-Thank you</i>

<i>'Cause I'm not doing</i>
<i>any of it.</i>

<i>-You were nice--</i>
-You're not?-

<i>No.</i>

Lord of the Rings is so bad.

<i>No it's not!</i>

<i>It is! It's so bad!</i>

<i>I've never seen it.</i>

<i>You have to see it!</i>

Okay, the only thing I got
an A+ in was culinary arts.

You're gonna love it!
You're gonna love it!

For as long as I can remember

we have allowed ourselves
to be planted in rows.

For as long as I can remember

we have allowed ourselves
to be buried in rows.

Have we forgotten how to live?

As our memory fades,

our deepest dreams
can become buried within us.

We begin looking
outside of ourself

for life

for inspiration

for love.

What was dreamed to be
a life of exploration

becomes a life of repetition.

We learn to comply

while we wonder

mostly in secret

what happened to our joy?

Greater realities surround us

but we can't see them.

We can't feel them.

We become closed to them.

We stop listening.

We grow arrogant
in our forgetfulness

insisting we know how to live.

Insisting that
what we know

is all there is to know.

Without great dreams

we cannot change.

Without change

we are out of rhythm
with our life.

At odds with our nature,

we grow tired and resentful.

Cut off from our innocence,

our inner life
becomes hardship,

and our outer life confirms it.

We develop a constant need
to be built up

to be stimulated.

I love you!

Thank you!

You're perfect!

To feed the many appetites

that make us feel alive.

But the rush of emotions
dies in a moment,

and then we just need more.

Our human life

becomes our life

without thought
of the greater life

that even now sustains us.

We may remember exactly

when we gave up
on our innocence.

When the world around us
overwhelmed our trust

that who we are is enough.

Seeding doubt

that our dream must not be real.

But where can we go

without that dream to guide us?

We try to find some way
to orient ourselves.

But no matter where we search

no matter what we do

we feel a deeper longing
that is rarely answered

that nothing outside us
can answer.

When do we go back in to listen?

When do we become still enough

to hear our own calling?

We can become so lost

that we forget
even what we have lost.

Our innocence
seems like another being

a childish fantasy

impossible to find.

To remember our dream

we may have to walk
back through a past

we have tried very hard to bury.

Separated from our own source

from our own love

we wither and die

while life waits

right inside us.

It can take a great pain
to wake us up

a death to what we thought
our life was all about.

In that emptiness

through that crack

from a darkness
we tried everything to avoid

our deeper memory
begins to stir.

I am always close.

Always waiting.

Always offering another chance

no matter what you have done

with every other chance.

I will not leave you

because

I am you.

This deeper memory

takes root

and begins to grow.

The more it grows

the more I trust it's power.

Quietly I realize

this power is me.

Reminders are everywhere

that there is so much
more to life

than what I have been living!

And now this unknown
is all I want to know.

This new life growing within me

is all I want to tend to.

We have given ourselves
this opportunity

to bring forth
everything we are

to love everything we are

to transform ourselves

into greater and greater

expressions of life.

We don't know how to do this.

Our Innocence does.

We don't believe it is possible.

Our Innocence knows it is.

We have that seed

within us

reaching up for light

down for rich soil

to create itself

to make it's dream known.

Look at our bodies:

Every finger matters in our grip

and in our touch.

Every cell has a purpose.

Every fluid carries something

we cannot live without.

Every organ beats or hums

in infinite complexity

giving us the
staggering opportunity

of life.

We are born remembering.

And this memory

is always with us.

In this Innocence

we embrace life

actively seeking out experiences

and living them richly
into wisdom.

Each bold step
makes the next step bolder.

Every adventure into the unknown

creates more trust

for grander adventures.

I am the creator of my life

through the power
of my own thought.

Through the potency
of my own dreams

my life takes shape and form.

I have created what my life is.

I am now creating
what it will become.

Our own

endless

ever-evolving creation

into the vast unknown.

The eternal womb of space

waiting

for new dreams
to be conceived

for new life to be created

for new realms
to be experienced.

Patiently waiting.

Waiting

for you

to remember.

Find me.
