NO.  THANK YOU

NO?  I BELIEVE--
I BELIEVE I AM STONED,

AND YOU'RE NOT STONED.

YOUR...

THE WHOLE FUCKING PLAN
IS HORRIBLE.

I HEARD HE TALKED
TO THE COPS.

I MEAN, WHAT WOULD
JAMES CAGNEY DO?

THIS IS WHAT WE NEED.
WHAT?

WHAT WOULD
JAMES CAGNEY DO?

HMM?

WHAT WOULD YOU DO,

HE DOESN'T

HUH?

GOD, I'M SICK OF THIS PLACE!
I JUST WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

I JUST WANT TO LIVE

IT'S JUST BEEN NOTHING.

YOU'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE,

I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.

<i>DON'T.</i>

I MEAN...

IT'S JUST--

<i>YOU KNOW...</i>

I'M NOT YOUR MOM, LEXI.

WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GET OUT OF HERE? HUH?

JUST GET OUT OF HERE.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

GO WHERE?
WHERE?  ANYWHERE!

IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S A LINE
OF GUYS AROUND THE BLOCK

WAITING TO TAKE CARE OF ME.
<i>OH, HONEY.</i>

FUCK MEN.

YOU GOTTA LEARN HOW
TO DEPEND ON YOURSELF.

ALL MEN HAVE EVER DONE
IS HOLD YOU BACK.

HE HOLDS YOU BACK.
HE'S NOT THAT BAD.

YEAH.
HE TREATS YOU LIKE SHIT.

( sighs )
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. YOU'RE SMART.

YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
ANYTHING.

AND HE MAKES YOU BELIEVE
YOU'RE USELESS.

( whispers )
I GUESS.

YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT
THIS HOUSE AND THIS CITY...

IS THE WAY I FEEL
ABOUT MYSELF.

( feigns snore )

EVERYBODY FEELS
LIKE THAT SOMETIMES.

EVERYBODY DOES.

<i>( blues music playing )</i>

"WHAT'S WITH THE GUN?"

HEY, RELAX.
I'M RELAXED.

ARE YOU RELAXED?

HELENA?

HEY!

MISHA!

HOW DID YOU GET HERE?
WHAT'S UP?

HOW DID YOU--
HEY!

OH MY GOODNESS.
HOW DID YOU GET ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE?

I, UH, OOH--

THE WRONG GUY.

( laughs )

THIS IS--
THIS IS LEXI.

HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

YOU, UH--
YOU LOOK GREAT!

THIS IS WHERE I--  YEAH.
YOU WORK?  GREAT.

SO YOU HAD IT ANNULLED,
BUT YOU STILL LIVE TOGETHER?

YEAH.

I GUESS IT'S LIKE
A BAD HABIT YOU CAN'T BREAK.

BUT--

I MEAN--

( chuckling )

AND YOU GUYS GET ALONG?
LIKE MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES, WE GET ALONG.

( giggling )
THAT'S OKAY.  SO, UH... WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

RESEDA.
OH, COOL.

<i>Helena:</i>
<i>NO, I GREW UP IN JERSEY.</i> <i>YOU GO.</i>

I CAME OUT HERE TO-- YOU KNOW-- TO DO THE THING.

TO GET DISCOVERED.
OHH!

HUH?

<i>( Misha laughing )</i>
I'M ON <i>BAYWATCH.</i>

<i>OH!</i>
( giggling )

I CAME OUT HERE
TO DANCE, YOU KNOW. - Misha: <i>OH MY GOD.</i>

YOU WERE SO GOOD.  AMAZING.
LEGITIMATELY.

YOU COULD HAVE DONE THAT.
WHATEVER.

MM.  MM.

I THINK NEW YORK'S
THE PLACE FOR DANCE.

I THINK YOU NEED A DRINK.

DAMN!
WHERE'D YOU FIND HER?

I'M GONNA GO PEE,

<i>IF THAT'S OKAY?</i>

( whispering )
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

I FUCKING HATE HER.

HELENA IS SO COOL.

SHE THINKS
SHE'S HOT SHIT.

BULLSHIT.
YOU'RE JUST ON ONE OF YOUR JEALOUSY TRIPS.

WHY DON'T YOU ACT
LIKE THAT AROUND SERGEI?

I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIM.
YOU DON'T?

( softly ) GOD.

YOU KNOW I DON'T
CARE ABOUT HIM.

WHAT, YOU CARE
ABOUT YURI?

WELL,
I HAVEN'T WASTED TWO YEARS OF MY LIFE FOR NOTHING.

I DO--
OH, YOU'RE SO SURE.

W-W-WH--

WHAT DOES HE GIVE YOU
OTHER THAN MONEY?

HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU.
SHUT UP.

<i>â™ª BUT LOVE â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª CAN BE â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A FLEETING THING... â™ª</i>

YOU KNOW
WHO I CARE ABOUT.

<i>â™ª IT DON'T LAST TOO LONG â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª NOT LIKE</i>
<i>COCOA AND GIN. â™ª</i>

WHY WE NEED COPS
WHEN WE HAVE TROY?

SERGEI, IT'S ADDED
FUCKING PROTECTION.

( ball rattles )

HEY.
HEY.

A TOAST.

WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?
A FUCKING DISASTER.

Yuri: <i>IGNORE HIM.</i>
HEY, HEY, HEY.

YES, IGNO--
( chuckles )

YES, IGNORE ME.

NA ZDOROVYE!
<i>HERE IS TO FUCKING--</i>

INVISIBLE ME.

DROP IT.
WE DID.

WE DID, BABY.

WE FUCKING
DROP EVERYTHING.

YOU KNOW, HE BRING ME HERE.

NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

NO, IS NEVER

ALL WE DO IS SIT HERE

IT'S FOR WHAT?
WE DO WHAT?

WHAT--  WH-WHAT IS
THE FUCKING BULLSHIT?

ENOUGH!

AND WHY
WE DO NOTHING?

BECAUSE OF YOU.

MAYBE WE CAN HELP.

PLEASE TO LEAVE A MAN
TO DO A MAN'S JOB.

WHAT ARE YOU--
FROM THE FUCKING STONE AGES?

ACTUALLY, YES.
THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP.

YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR CLOTHES OFF...

<i>AND PLAY</i>
<i>WITH YOURSELF--</i>

( glass shatters )

( both laughing )

I BELIEVE THE LADIES
CAN DO THIS!

( grunting )

( keys clattering )

Man:
<i>WHO THE FUCK IS THAT?</i>

( sighs )

IT'S ME, DUMMY.

<i>THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET</i>
<i>YOUR HEAD BLOWN OFF, HELENA.</i>

YEAH, WELL I LIVE HERE--
UNFORTUNATELY.

YEAH, I KNOW YOU DO.

WHERE WERE YOU?
YOU KNOW WHAT, JACK?

NOT TONIGHT,
ALL RIGHT?

YEAH?
WHO WERE YOU WITH?

HUH?

UH... FRIENDS, JACK!
FRIENDS.

YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS. - OH, GOOD.

YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEXT TIME, JACK, WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHOOT ME?

YOU KNOW, HELENA?
YOU'RE WELCOME TO LEAVE ANY TIME YOU WANT.

I KNOW, JACK.
YOU TELL ME ALL THE TIME.

WHY DON'T YOU THINK
OF SOMETHING NEW? - LET ME HELP YOU.

C'MERE.
( groans )

HEY.

OKAY!

WHAT IS WITH YOU?

YOU KNOW, I HAVE SEEN
YOU NAKED BEFORE, HELENA.

<i>( shoes thud )</i>
( Helena chuckles )

YEAH.

I HOPE YOU HAVE
A GOOD MEMORY.

AAH!
NOW, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO NASTY LIKE THAT?

YOU KNOW WHAT, JACK?
NO, I-I MEAN IT.

WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BE SO NASTY?

( groans )
WHY CAN'T WE JUST BE NICE TO EACH OTHER?

YOU KNOW, LIKE IT
USED TO BE.  WHY--

YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH. YOU CAN COME SLEEP WITH ME.

NOTHING WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN.
YOU KNOW, WE--

WE COULD JUST CUDDLE.

YOU WANT
TO CUDDLE?

YEAH.

YEAH, I WANT TO CUDDLE.

( chuckles )

OKAY, LET'S CUDDLE.
( both chuckle )

GO WAIT
FOR ME INSIDE.

OKAY?
AND WE'LL CUDDLE.

WE'LL CUDDLE AND CUDDLE
AND CUDDLE ALL NIGHT.

WE'LL CUDDLE
AND WE'LL MAKE TENTS,

AND WE'LL CUDDLE
SOME MORE

<i>AND WE'LL FLUFF</i>
<i>THE PILLOWS UP.</i>

( slams )

( screaming )

SO, NOW I UNDERSTAND

WHY YOU DON'T WANT
TO FUCK ME ANYMORE, HUH?

BECAUSE YOU LIKE
TO EAT CUNT.

WE WERE SLEEPING,
BUT MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

THAT'S PROBABLY
ONE OF YOUR PROBLEMS.

OH, NO, NO, NO.
YOU MAKE A MISTAKE.

I LOVE THIS.

IS NATURAL, IS BEAUTIFUL,
NORMAL, TWO WOMEN TOGETHER.

<i>I MISS THE PERFORMANCE.</i>
<i>PLEASE, DO IT.</i> - JESUS.

DO YOUR FUCKING GODDAMN
LESBIAN SHOW!

HUH?

DO IT FOR ME!

FOR SERGEI, PLEASE.

DO YOUR LESBIAN SHOW.

<i>I MISSED THE SHOW.</i>

JUST DO A LITTLE.

YOUR PUSSIES ARE WET, HUH?

DO THE LESBIAN SHOW.
DO THE LESBIAN SHOW.

I'LL PUT A FUCKING KNIFE
IN YOUR FUCKING RIB!

( groans )

SO, YOU TAKE...
YOUR LESBIAN SHIT AND YOU GET OUT.

WHERE IS SHE SUPPOSED TO GO
AT FOUR-FUCKING-CLOCK IN THE MORNING?

SUCK... <i>MY</i> COCK.

YOU HAVE 10 MINUTES.

HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO SLEEP WITH ALL THIS GOING ON AROUND ME?

TALK TO YOUR FRIEND.
HE'S FUCKING PSYCHO!

YES, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING I CAN DO.

HE TOLD HER
SHE HAS 10 MINUTES.

MISH, I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT?

THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT? YOU CAN TELL HIM THAT SHE STAYS.

AND IF HE DOESN'T
LIKE IT, HE CAN LEAVE! - MISHA, MISHA, MISHA.

WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT? - THIS IS NOT OUR PROBLEM.

IS THEIR PROBLEM,
SO JUST STAY OUT OF IT.

I'VE NEVER ASKED YOU
FOR ANYTHING.

PLEASE DO WHAT'S RIGHT.

COME ON.
SHE'S ALL ON THE FLOOR.

COME QUICKLY,
PLEASE-- COME ON! - I CAN'T HELP YOU.

IF SHE LEAVES, I LEAVE.

OKAY?

DO WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO.

YOU'RE PATHETIC,
YOU KNOW THAT?

( disgusted sigh )

Helena:
<i>I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY</i> <i>KICKED YOU OUT FOR THAT.</i>

I MEAN, MOST GUYS
LOVE THAT SHIT, DON'T THEY?

WHAT KIND OF JOB WAS IT,
BY THE WAY?

ALL I KNOW IS THAT
THERE IS A CASINO

OWNED BY SOME INDIANS
THEY'RE TRYING TO RIP OFF WITH SOME COPS.

FUCKING IMMIGRANTS,
I SWEAR TO GOD.

<i>â™ª SHOULD I ACT AGAINST</i>
<i>MY BETTER JUDGMENT... â™ª</i>

YOU DO REALIZE HOW STUPID
YOU GUYS ARE, RIGHT?

<i>THINK ABOUT IT.</i>

THEY'RE READY TO PULL OFF
THE BIGGEST HEIST OF THEIR LIVES,

AND THEY JUST
KICK YOU OUT?

I GOT KICKED.
MISHA LEFT.

KICKED, LEFT, WHATEVER,

THEY MADE YOU LEAVE BEFORE
THEY GOT ANY MONEY, RIGHT?

<i>I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.</i>

<i>I MEAN, FUCK, I CAN'T</i>
<i>EVEN GET ALIMONY, RIGHT?</i>

NOWADAYS,
YOU CAN'T GET ANYTHING. THEY WEREN'T STUPID.

LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS
IT LOOKED LIKE YOU GOT-- DUPED.

<i>â™ª WHEN WILL I EVER LEARN... â™ª</i>
( chuckles )

<i>â™ª JUST LIKE A MOTH THAT'S</i>
<i>DRAWN INTO A FLAME... â™ª</i>

SHE'S RIGHT.
SHE'S FUCKING RIGHT.

<i>DID YOU SEE ANY MONEY</i>
<i>FROM THE LAST JOB THEY DID?</i>

OF COURSE NOT.
WE WERE FUCKED.

TALKING ABOUT MEN HERE.

OH, MAN.

Helena:
<i>I'M TELLIN' YOU GUYS,</i>

HE'S A COP AND-- AND--
THEN YOU COULD SCREW THOSE GUYS.

AND HE CAN GET THE PROMOTION
THAT HE ALWAYS WANTED AND--

( paper peeling )

( laughing )

I DON'T KNOW, MISH.
WHERE WOULD YOU GET IT?

FROM THAT ROACH MOTEL
WE'RE SLEEPING IN.

REVENGE.

ALL RIGHT,
SO YOU SAY YOU HEARD NOISES COMING FROM APARTMENT 814,

IS THAT RIGHT,
MRS. LEECHNER? - YES.

APARTMENT--

814?

YES, YOU SAID
814 A MINUTE AGO. BROTHER AARON'S APARTMENT?

OH, BROTHER ARIEL.
ARIEL.

HE WAS SO KIND
AND LOVIN'.

HE WAS ALWAYS
LOOKIN' FOR GOD.

<i>Jack's voice:</i>
<i>I HATE... THIS... JOB.</i>

<i>I HATE THIS LADY.</i>
<i>I WANT TO HIT HER WITH A BAT.</i>

<i>I WONDER WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE</i>
<i>IF I FUCKED HER?</i>

<i>PROBABLY BE LIKE A CORPSE.</i>

<i>SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE.</i>

<i>THE FUN DIED THE DAY I REALIZED</i>
<i>THIS ALL LED TO NOWHERE.</i>

THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

OH, NO, NO, NO.

SO, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE RUSSIANS?

DON'T WORRY
YOUR LITTLE HEAD ABOUT IT.

YOU'RE GOING TO
ARREST THEM, RIGHT? - WE'RE KEEPING TABS ON THEM.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

I MEAN,
THERE ARE TWO DEAD COPS,

AND WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THESE TWO RUSSIAN GENTLEMEN

WERE INVOLVED IN SOME WAY,
SHAPE OR FORM,

SO NOW IT'S JUST
WATCH AND WAIT.

BUT YOU ARE GOING
TO ARREST THEM, RIGHT?

( yawns )

OH, YEAH.  YEAH.

<i>YEAH, WE WILL...</i>
<i>WHEN IT'S TIME.</i>

WOODY, DID YOU SEE ME YAWN?

I DIDN'T YAWN, DID I?

HE'S A FUCKING
LITTLE LIAR.

I KNOW HOW HE LIES.

I KNOW WHEN HE LIES,
HE YAWNS.

AND HE YAWNED... REAL BIG.
HE'S A WEAK LITTLE SHIT.

HE PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING
TALK TO THE RUSSIANS.

MAYBE HE DID.

MAYBE HE TRIED
TO SCREW YOU OVER-- LIKE THE REST OF US.

NO...

IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

HE BROUGHT ME
FLOWERS YESTERDAY.

AND CANDY.
( scoffs )

TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE NEW
FUCKING LIFE.

I BET YOU
THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING. LITTLE FUCKING WEASEL.

YOU'RE SO MUCH SMARTER
THAN HIM.

I AM SMARTER THAN HIM!
YES, YOU ARE.

I WILL NAIL HIS ASS
TO THE WALL.

<i>( music playing,</i>
<i>singing, chatting )</i>

Troy:
<i>THE RESPONSE TIME</i> <i>VARIES.</i>

I'VE SEEN TWO MINUTES.
I'VE SEEN 10.

SO YOU NEED
TO BE PATCHED IN WITH THE POLICE SCANNER.

ANY DIVERSIONS
WILL BE APPRECIATED.

THAT'S NO PROBLEM.
A PIECE OF CAKE, RIGHT? - Dykes: <i>YEAH.</i>

Yuri:
<i>SERGEI AND I STORM IN</i> <i>DURING THE BLACKOUT,</i>

HIT THE GUARDS WITH
FLASHBANGS AND TEAR GAS.

I'LL BEEP YOU THE SECOND

Woman:
<i>IT'S BEEN A MONTH</i> <i>AND A HALF.</i>

YOU HAVE BEEN CHECKING YOUR
MACHINE EIGHT TIMES A DAY. - SO WHAT?

<i>DAN IS NOT CALLING YOU.</i>

WHY ARE YOU BEING
SUCH A BITCH?

<i>LUCY, IT'S BEEN</i>

IT'S ONE MINUTE.

<i>YOU'RE CHECKING YOUR MACHINE</i>
<i>EIGHT TIMES A DAY.</i>

Lucy:
<i>I GOT YOU</i> <i>THIS GODDAMN JOB.</i>

YOU ARE THE LOUSIEST FRIEND.

AND I'LL LET YOU USE
MY SKATEBOARD TOMORROW.

WHICH ONE?
THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.

AND WHY WASN'T
HER NAME MENTIONED IN ANY OF YOUR PAPERWORK?

IT WASN'T?

<i>( phone ringing )</i>

YES?  SEND HER IN.

Captain:
<i>TORETTI, HAVE YOU MET</i> <i>MY WIFE DANIELLE?</i>

Dan:
<i>I'LL WAIT FOR YOU</i> <i>DOWNSTAIRS.</i>

YOU ARE...

THE SORRIEST, SADDEST WOP

EVER TO WEAR A BADGE.

IT'S GONNA TAKE ME
A COUPLE OF DAYS

TO FIGURE OUT JUST
HOW FULL OF SHIT YOU ARE.

AND AFTER THAT,

THANK GOD, YOU'RE OVER.

AW, JESUS, HELENA.

HAD A ROUGH ONE, HUH?

I THINK WE NEED

OKAY?

I'M NOT STUPID.

I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

I JUST WANT
TO KEEP THINGS EASY,

<i>AND FAIR.</i>

I KNOW...

YOU HAVE

Jack's voice: <i>I'D LIKE</i>

<i>AND ALL I WANT,</i>
<i>SINCE I GAVE YOU</i> <i>THE INFORMATION,</i>

IS A PART.

A PART FOR ME

YOU HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE
BUT TO SAY YES.

I KNEW YOU WERE

<i>Guess how big.  Guess.</i>

I DON'T WANNA GUESS, MOM.

I HEARD SHE'S BACK

<i>OR ARE YOU GOING TO WORK?</i>
I'LL COME IN ONE MINUTE, OKAY?

DELUDE YOURSELF A LITTLE MORE?

YOU'VE BEEN CLEAN

I'M SO GLAD I CAME

I ASKED WHAT YOU DID,

BECAUSE WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
I OWNED A RESTAURANT.

REALLY?
MM-HMM.

THAT'LL CHANGE,
THE OLDER YOU GET.

AH, THERE'S MY BUS!

<i>HEY!  WAIT!  WAIT!</i>

<i>( water drips )</i>

THANKS.

YOU CAN STAY AS LONG

'CAUSE I KNOW SHE'S
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

Misha:
<i>TROY, LISTEN.</i>

I KNOW THESE
TWO JERKS REAL WELL.

I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING,
WHATEVER THEY PROMISED YOU,

WHATEVER CUT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE, IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?
IF I BACK OUT NOW, I'M A DEAD MAN.

YOU'RE ALREADY
A DEAD MAN.

LISTEN, SERGE HAS GOT
PLANS OF HIS OWN.

IT SURE DOESN'T
INCLUDE YOU.

<i>( phone ringing )</i>

Sergei: <i>HELLO!</i>
<i>Sergei, it's Misha.</i>

<i>You know why Lexi</i>
<i>stopped fucking you?</i>

<i>'Cause she was</i>

<i>So the next time you think</i>
<i>of beating up my friend,</i> <i>think twice,</i>

<i>'cause I swear</i>
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

( phone disconnects )

<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

YES?
<i>Yuri, it's Mish.</i> <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

OH, HOLD ON.

( panting )

( moaning )

WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

<i>Lexi saw Sergei last night.</i>
<i>He was with some Mexicans</i> <i>buying guns.</i>

<i>Do you realize that Sergei</i>
<i>had the cops killed?</i> <i>And you're next.</i>

MISHA?  MISH?

BUNCH OF NIGGERS
FIGHTING KU KLUX KLAN.

YEAH?
WELL, THAT'S ON EVERY NIGHT.

TURN IT BACK ON.

THE WORD?  ANTS.
<i>JESUS!  GOD DAMN IT!</i>

NO, IT'S THE REDS.

MM-HMM.

OKAY.

SO HOW ARE WE GONNA
PROCEED FROM HERE?

HMM?

THEY'RE DEAD AND YOU
WANNA TALK ABOUT MONEY? YOU FUCKING--

WAIT A MINUTE.
<i>JACK...</i>

WAIT A MINUTE,
THE PHONE'S GOING.

CAN YOU HEAR ME?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

ASK HIM WHAT
THE FUCK TO DO.

CAN YOU HEAR ME?
HELLO?

SERGEI AND YURI
ARE DEAD.

Misha:
<i>COME ON, LEXI.</i>

YOU CAN GET
THAT LITTLE RESTAURANT YOU ALWAYS DREAMED ABOUT.

Helena:
<i>OR SHE COULD GO TO JAIL.</i>

OR GET KILLED
IN THE PROCESS.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU TWO?
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU TWO?

THIS IS A NEW LIFE!
THIS IS LIKE, WE CAN DO ANYTHING!

BY ROBBING A CASINO?
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER.

IT'S THE ANSWER FOR US.

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

GET A COLLEGE DEGREE?
WORK FOR SOME MINIMUM WAGE?

DANCE ON BROADWAY?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

I MEAN, LIFE IS JUST
PASSING US BY, YOU KNOW?

AND WE'RE NOTHING!
WE'RE LOSERS!  I'M A LOSER.

( sighs )

( sighs )

I DON'T WANNA BE
THAT PERSON ANYMORE.

I'M NOT PROUD OF IT.
I'M NOT.

FATE IS GIVING US
ANOTHER CHANCE.

TO STEAL?

THE MONEY'S INSURED.

IT'S SOMETHING.
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING!

<i>YOU'RE NOT GETTING</i>
<i>ANY YOUNGER.</i>

<i>YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE--</i>
<i>LYING HERE IN 10 YEARS?</i>

<i>BECAUSE YOU WILL</i>
<i>IF YOU DON'T TAKE</i> <i>THAT RISK.</i>

WHAT ABOUT YOU?

FUCK ME.

WE CAN DO THIS.

Misha: <i>HEY.</i>
NO!

TOO LATE.
THE WHOLE GANG'S HERE.

YOU REMEMBER LEXI?
THIS IS HELENA.

AND WOODY.
THIS IS WOODY.

WOODY.

Troy:
<i>NOW, THESE ARE</i> <i>THE DYE PACKS.</i>

THEY ARE LOADED IN
WITH THE MONEY,

AND THEY HAVE
LOCATOR BEEPERS HIDDEN IN EACH BAG.

SO WE'LL HAVE TO SOAK
THE BAGS IN WATER.

ISN'T IT JUST EASIER
TO TAKE THEM OUT?

WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE QUESTIONS? COME ON.

I'M JUST ASKING.

WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME
IF WE'RE RUNNING.

SO, AFTER THE HIT,
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE

TWO TO 10 MINUTES
TO GET OUT OF THE CASINO.

AND ANOTHER TWO HOURS
TO GET BEYOND THE CITY LIMITS.

WHO'S DRIVING
THE RENT-A-CAR? - I'LL DRIVE.

HEY.
