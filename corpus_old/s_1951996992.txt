Jimmy, we discussed this
you can't tape our sessions

it's not allowed!

Does your defiance make you feel more powerful?

Filming people makes you
feel like you're in control of the situation

Doesn't it?

Maybe?

I can seat here as long as you can

and you cannot force me to participate
in your little game here.

Jimmy, put the camera away, please.

Ok! Alright! That's enough!
Give me the camera! Come on. Now Jimmy!

Give it to me.

We go, give it to me.

Give me the camera!

Give it to me Jimmy!

Aren't you a fucking nut? Are You boy?

A little crazy? Give it to me.

Hey mom! I heard you and dad
doing it nasty last night.

Thanks for that one.

By the way! Who the fuck is Nancy?

Hey Dad, Mom's on the phone telling
our friends you're hung like a light switch.

There it goes! He makes to reach and
mass, both balls at the same time.

One heck of a double play.

And a sniff to finish them off.

I live in a fucking fake show.

You like that, you fucking nigger?

Oh yeah, baby, I like it.

So what was going through your mind
when I called you a nigger?

This cost you an extra 50.

You like call me a nigger?
When you get your nut off?

No.

Then why d'you call me that?

I was trying to do the unthinkable.
when I called you that.

I wanted to see if I could do that.

And that you found?

I believe that I want to die.

Judy, Judy first period track.

Oh! Miss Sanburrows,  bitch of all bitches.

Give it to me.

Do you want it?

God damn!

Mary Crearlie.

Billy Ransend, damned imbecile.

Morning guys!

Pretty good.

How you doing?

Hi guys.
For heaven's sake.

How's it going?

Happy anniversary, that's all I wanted to...

Jimmy, get out of here.
Hey Dad.

Happy anniversary!

I'm sorry.
I sit down it.

Off you go.

Thank you very much for coming,
they wanted to double the bet at that point.

Thanks, honey!
I'm 50 yards from the green and I'm looking...uh

and I'm not looking at the caddy, right?
and I'm saying ok, a big 7 is gonna do it, right?

On any occasion I would probably made it.

But I'm screwed, six ways, sorry!

So he hands me the club
and I'm not even thinking about it...

You Know, it is bad enough my parents made
me come here

I have to put up with you and that stupid camera.

I have something I wanna show you.
What?

Something disgusting?

Something that probably will make me wanna puke?

No, something beautiful.

Something that might change your life.

You're weird, Jimmy.

The people are calling you names
because they don't understand you?

I'm not gonna talk to you until
you turn that camera off.

You know, just because I'm up here, doesn't
mean I like you or anything.

Soon as this is over, I'm going back downstairs.

That's Miss Sanburrows' car.

And Billy Ransend, that red headed prick that
decided to dump a coke on your head?

I put a hand of weed in his locker and left
an anonymous note in the principal's office.

Mary Crearlie
I took care of her too.

Why did you do that?

I did it for you.

Shut off the fucking camera!

The problem is that Tom wants me to stay late
Not this late!

He's threatened to take away this account while I was away.

It is time to speak up to Tom.

I have spoken up to Tom.

You two are equals in that
company. He is not your superior.

Not technically.

He takes away another account, I'm gonna be...
I don't know what I'm gonna do

He threatened to take away two accounts.

Why is he taking away any accounts?
What's Bill have to say about it?

Because of his daddy owns the company...

You know the man for 20 years.

It doesn't seem to matter in this case.

Anyway, I'm tired of it.
Wish I could just quit that job, but I can't.

Hon, are we having the salmon tonight?
That's terrible!

I don't want it, I mean I told you

We're having the salmon, I got it at the market for 1$ 98.

It tastes like it's 1$ 98.

No, I can't buy your underwear
and dinner, so eat home.

At least you can do.
Spend too much attention on that stupid kid.

You don't spend time.

I spend plenty of attention on him.

When is the last time you had a Saturday
or anything like that.

He doesn't want to have a Saturday with me,
he's a weirdo, he's a freak!

Are you ready for me, you fucking slut?
I'm not ready yet.

You know, I don't like to wait.
Do you know what to do?

I put on my make-up.

Your were the one that wanted do this thing.

I just wanna take a little time, ok?
I just wanna have some time!

Come on, slut!

Make a cocktail.

You know you like it too.

I'm just saying you're being taking advantage of me.

You don't listen to me, I'm telling you
that I'm not being taking advantage of

I'm just doing what I'm supposed to do
in work, ok?

I'm just trying, I'm just trying.

You should have the front office.

Oh, stop it.

Or maybe an increase.

And you like it?

I'm not talking of anything.

You could answer when I call.

I'm making calls all the time, I can't talk to you.

You always think I gotta
pay all my attention to you.

I am your wife.

All right.

So...

My God.

what you guys are you up to?

what the God damn fuck are you doing here?
I told you he would find out.

Give it to me camera, you fucking asshole.

Give me that fucking camera.

you bitch, you bitch.

Fuck you.

Fucking fag.

You, you want to feel something, young man?

So you wanted to see how it really works.

Nancy, Nancy let me call your daddy.

No! No filming!

I'm leaving, I swear!

Ok, Ok.

when I'm on camera, it makes me nervous.

Fuck the camera!
Come on talk to me!

Alright.

Tell me how you felt
when you saw the video.

I felt like someone
had read the mind.

And?

I felt like someone attempted my mind
and made sure's being protected.

And what you said about God?

I said that I felt like God had sent to
someone to protect me,

to look after me

you are the only person in my life

who's ever looked after me

God I hate you when you film me crying.

How you like it, huh? How do like you it
when the camera shoot right up your ass?

You like it, do you?

In generally I place the camera a little further away from my face
but if this is your personal style

then I guess I'll have to adjust it

Does this work for you?
Fuck it, I'm leaving!

Judy, wait.

What?

Come on, don't you wanna ask me anything?
Come on.

Ok. Why did you get kicked out of school?

Taking a semester off.

I heard you got kicked out because
you talked to a man who killed himself on the camera.

I didn't tell him to and  I didn't tell him not to.

If he wanted to die it was his choice.

And the camera was there,
not me. That's the truth.

You can believe whatever you want.

And...

...now I am here with the folks,

going to therapy,

...reevaluating my life's ambitions.

And as my Mom likes to say ...I'm...

gonna take this semester off,

start the next semester at a community college

and forget the whole thing ever happened.

It's not so bad. Not so bad.

Maybe you shouldn't film everything.

I don't film everything.

Just what's important!

Why me?

What d'you think?

Stop!

Just tell me!

Because you love me?

Yeah, you understand!

So where are you taking me?

To a beautiful place.
Where?

Chuckie Cheese.

Ok, but seriously.

I can't tell you, I'll ruin it.

Just trust me!

Fine.

Can I ask you something?

Can ask for anything.

Do you hate your parents?

Yeah, yeah, I do,
but I understand them.

What's to understand?

Well, I mean I understand that my ascension
into young adulthood

trigger their descending into middle life crisis.

You see, when an old child leaves the nest
the parents have to re-evaluate their lives

and all they see is
these younger, better versions of themselves.

They feel insecure because
we no longer seek their approval.

They are abandoned because
of our need for privacy.

You know, they used to take us to
baseball games, cover our scars with bandages.

And once we no longer need  Mom to nurse our bruises...

Dad to look up to,
they put ... and subsequent so forth and turn to question.

How do you know all these things?

I am a genius.

Actually...

the years when you've no one to talk to

don't play sports, don't go out,

have no one to listen to you...

No one to ask advice,

you pretty much have to figure everything out on your own!

You're so smart!

You're so beautiful!

Do you think I'm pretty?

Let me see, I think you're the most beautiful
person in the world.

Actually, I think you're the
most beautiful person in the universe.

No one has ever said that to me before.

Yeah, well, get used to it!

Or do you think that I'm smarter?

Yeah, yeah.

Do you think fat?
Yeah.

How can you say that? I weigh 53 kilos.

Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you said flat... flat-chested

I am not flat-chested!

Ok, prove it!

I don't have to prove it, what you can see.

No, I still can't tell.

I wear a 4B cup.

Ok, well, then show me!
Take out your little titties, come on!

I'm not just gonna take them out!
You take yours out!

It's already out baby.
Oh, my God!

I don't believe you just fucking did that.

Yeah, that's why I did it.
My God.

I showed you mine, now show me yours!

Come on!

Wow, Yes!, I'm pulling over!

No.
Yes, I'm pulling over.

We gonna get your boobies on camera.

Alright Judy, show me your titties!

Come on!
I'm embarrassed.

You don't have to be embarrassed.
You can trust me!

You can trust me with your life.

Dude, for real this time. Come on.

Take off your bra!

Yes, that is very nice!

Very nice!

What's the matter?

I've showed you my breast and I've seen your
penis and we haven't even kissed yet.

you haven't even ask me to be your girlfriend.

Will you be my girlfriend?
Yeah.

Would you give me a kiss?
Yeah.

Will you turn off the camera?
No.

I don't wanna waste the opportunity
to document the most beautiful moment of my life

I want to see them again!

Just turn off the camera, please.
Turn it off!

Are you getting these?

This is where you wanted to take me?

Yeah, what's the matter?

I want to go home.

Don't fuck this up, Jimmy!
Be normal!

Normal.

Got to fuck everything up!

Hello.
Hello.

How you're feeling?

I don't know, huh, so good!

My God, I envy you.

I don't know, I just really want it lately
Really bad.

What is that?

I can't say, I'm embarrassed!

Oh, come on!

No, now you have to tell me.

It was after yesterday.

Yesterday?
Yeah.

After I saw you use that gun.

You were so scared.

You were shaking, I mean,

it was the most horrible thing
I ever did, I don't think I'll ever see you like that.

I was very scared first.
I didn't expect it to be so loud

and you looked so mean...

But when I got home and I started thinking about it.

about how your muscles looked and
how dangerous all seemed.

I just got... more excited and...

Horny?

Hold this for a second!
Where are you going?

I'll be right down.

You're so hot!

Dad keeps this in his closet.

It is heavy.

Now I see the appeal, give me the camera!

Do you like this?

Yeah! Oooh.

Yeah, it's hot!

Do you like that?

Oh, fuck, it's my parents.

Hurry up, hurry up!

That's not...

Shit.

God.

Now Judy!  Is there anything you'd like to say to your fans
before you go through with this?

I'm very much looking forward to losing
my thief virginity.

I would also want
to share these with my fans

Thank you for your boobies and thank you
for this rare behind the scenes look.

at your first crime / moment of truth.

Hey, you two! Stop there!

What the hell do you think you're doing, huh?

You can't go walking around the
store playing with that camera.

I want you to turn this thing off and get out of here, come on.

What is the matter with you Jimmy?
You almost got us caught!

So what is with that stupid camera?  What is it?

Why do you have to film everything?

It's like you have some sort of a
problem or something!

That's the reason why everyone thinks you're weird
that's why everyone makes fun of you.

So everybody makes fun of me, huh?

Yes, can't you give that thing just a fucking rest.

Don't you wanna deal with it?
You know what?

Fuck them and fuck you too if you care

I couldn't give a fuck what people think.

This is my life and I want to document it

and me filming you Judy...

happens to be the only reason

I manage to get out of the fucking bed every morning.

How does it feel, Jimmy?

How does it feel have someone tape you?

It doesn't matter how I feel right now, forget it!

What matters is that you
see inside of me and you're taping it.

Can you understand that?
I don't know!

Will you at least try?

Yeah

Never ever ask me not to film you

or anything we do

It's the only thing that I'll ever ask of you, Judy.

Ok, I'm sorry.

Would you swear on it with camera?

Cut that, you fat ass dickless fucking hick.

Jimmy.

Fuck it, Jimmy, stop!

My God, I love you Jimmy.

My God, Jimmy hold.

Jimmy!

My God.

Hi baby, I miss you, I'll be
waiting for you when you get out.

Be good and don't take too long!
Look what I go for you!

I can't wait for you to see it.

Welcome! May I take your order?

Can I get a double cheeseburger
with no pickles, large fries and a coke.

Fast forward!
Can I get a number 2, also please?

Sure that's 9$ 53, please pull out!

Sorry, that's what I missed more than anything.

So, what were you doing the whole day?

Masturbating mostly.

Hey, you cheated on me.

I'm supposed to be the only one responsible
for making you come.

You'd better be on
count for 24 hours a day.

Seriously, what were you doing there?
What was a day in the life of Jimmy in that house?

Outside masturbating...
Yeah.

Well, I talked and I talked and I fucking talked
until they were satisfied

And basically, I told them what they wanted to hear!
And said shit like

Now, when we real talk about my problems I realize that
my behavior was inappropriate.

And harmful toward others.

And then, ok, I realized
that I had to cry all the time.

Cause whenever somebody would cry
they call it a breakthrough.

You gotta start out like real slow, like this, you know...

Now I get into position.

I know now that violence
it's not the answer.

And then will be like...

I was wrong!

It was really really wrong.

I need help.

I never wanted to hurt anyone.

Especially to my parents...

After everything they've done for me.

And then they gave me a bitty bit of hug in the end.

Then, you know,  after a couple of weeks...

they diagnose you with something,
give you some medication and then you're done.

My God, you're a freaking genius!

I know, I am!

So what they gave you?

These pills, I don't take them.
I can't get a hard-on on them.

So what they said you have?

Oppositional Defiance Disorder. ODD.

You are so lucky, I wouldn't be
diagnosed with something.

So what does it mean?

ODD?

It is characterized by an overwhelming feeling
of negative hostile and defiant behavior

which causes the patient to not be able
to distinguish reality from fantasy.

I fucking love that.

Basically, I'm a delusional motherfucker.

I am so fucking hungry, man!

My God.

Fuck!
What?

Goddammit!

I specifically asked for no
pickles, they fucked up my order.

How will ODD brain handle this?
Will this ODD brain be able to restrain the pickle struggle?

Do the drive turn?

I don't know, I really don't know.

I don't know, I might just fucking go postal.
What am I gonna do?

My God!

O Jeez, it's so hot!

I'm burning my nipples with my pickles.

My God! Help me, Lord!

Help rule my heartbreak.

I love you Judy.

don't run so quick.

Hey, you know what?
What?

What if we could live here forever?

Right here?

Maybe not right here, but eventually we could buy some  land

we could live together on that
and we could be naked whenever we want.

What do you think?

I think you're waste.

You are right, but I'm serious.

I never want this to end
I want to see this moment forever.

I want to feel the air on my body
and I want to be naked and I wanna feel free

And I want us to fuck our brains out every single day.

You know what? I've seen a place like that.

You do?

Where is that?

Up in Arlinger.

I do look serious.

I'm telling you there is this amazing place
when I was in the bin.

It's all anybody talked about, you know,
anybody talked about!

But supposedly up in Arlinger there's this guy
Uncle Rodney,

he runs this commune where you can run around
and get drunk and naked all the time

It's all they do

Uncle Rodney's commune?

I'm not kidding.

Ok, we can go to uncle Rodney's commune.

Yeah.

You can go.

You really want me to say something?

Yeah, I really do.

I won't go one day without masturbating.

I want to live with my Goddamn penis.

I want to calm you

so we can have it three-way

and I wanna be cheating.

And...

I want to scratch my balls
with a cheese grader.

That's so gross
.

And...

I love you.

Loved you since we were kids.

You have?

I love you so much it hurts.

God is stabbing me in the freaking heart with
a thousand knives at the same fucking time.

You are the only person that can take the pain away.

You feel that way about me?

I love you so much that I'd rather
die than be without you.

Ok, you gotta make me a promise then.

Kind a like the way a husband and wife when they get promised.

To marry?

No, no, this is something more
powerful than marriage

It's a bond

It's our bond, it's transcendental.

What?

It's transcendental because...
transcends everything.

Life... love, people... things.

It really transcends death

If you swear on a bond it means that...

you'd rather die than break your promise.

It's so beautiful!

Judy...

I couldn't go a day without you.

OK, then swear on the bond.

Swear that we'll never let anything come
between us.

Not even death.

I'll never let anything come between us
not even death, I swear the bond.

We'll be together forever.

Forever.

I don't know what it is, love the ghetto
every time I get out it's the first place I want to go to.

Yeah, you know I really love it
when you're out the jail.

Do you think you could try
and stay out of it for a little while?

Yeah, if I'm not on bail, I'll probably go to jail.

I'm serious, you act like it's no big deal
when you go away.

Alright, alright.

No, it's not alright.

Listen, when you go in there
I stuck out here all by myself.

all alone, in the real world, Jimmy.

You go in and then come back like it's nothing
like everything's fine and it's not fine.

I don't want to live another day
without you. Do you understand me?

I would rather die.

Alright, I promise I'll never go back.

I promise, I swear on my life
I swear on a bond that I'll never go back.

Do you swear on the bond?

Now what?

Last time you got out we did it like 5 times

like as we soon as we saw each other
we got naked and we did it

and today my parents weren't even home
and I tried to do some stuff to you

and you were not even interested in it.

I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.

Is it because you gotta speak with your mom and Dad?

No.

Do you not like having sex with me anymore?
Do you not think I'm attractive anymore?

No, that has nothing to do with it, alright?

Look! I'll tell you!

After I saw my Dad getting
rammed in the ass by my Mom

I sort of blocked the whole thing out
so now when I go into the bin

that's all he wanna talk about

So, now, every time I get a word

it's like the instant replay machine goes off in my brain

and I'm just seeing my Mom like
pounding my Dad in the ass.

It's pretty unfortunate. It sucks.

It's really awful, I'm sorry.

Yeah, but you know what?
It's not like you tried very hard.

You just gave your little sex face
and grabbed my cock.

Ok, fine! How about this?
Do you like that?

That's what I'm talking about.

Oh, yeah...

Woody's coming out!
Is he?

Shit.

Dude, I think you hit somebody.
Stay here!

Jimmy, what you're doing?

Oh, fuck!

Well, we gotta take him to a hospital.

No, we'd get busted!

Shit, shit, he's not breathing
I think he's dead.

Is he fucking dead?!
I don't know!

Fuck, just pop the trunk.
No!

Just pop the trunk before somebody sees us, hurry up!

Fuck!

My God, I just wanna go home.

God.

I'm driving, hurry up, hurry up, come on.

Get in, get in, hurry!

I can't...

What the fuck! Get in
before somebody sees us!

We have a dead guy in the fucking trunk!

Fuck, my God, that's a fucking caught!

Alright just stay calm, stay calm,
don't say anything, don't cry!

My God, we have a dead guy in the fucking trunk
and there's a fucking cop right there.

Please, be calm!

Good evening. License and registration!

Yeah, certainly!

Here you go!

Sir, remove your keys from the  ignition
and step out of the vehicle for me, please.

Come on out back with me.

My God Jimmy.

Fuck!

What the fuck did just happen?

You want to fucking tell me what happen...
Shut the fuck up!

Fucking tell me!

What are you doing?

Filming.

It's dark, you can't see anything.

It's all infrared. Do you want to see?

No, I don't want to see it.

It is beautiful!

He's dead, he's in my car, Jimmy
and he stinks.

I want to go home.

I don't think I can do this.
I am not like you.

I can't do this!
I want to fucking go home!

Goddamit, what the... I'm sorry!

What the fuck is wrong with you?
We can't go home.

And you will do this, you did do this!
You killed him, Judy.

And you didn't even get into the car
until the cops showed up.

Do you want me to go to jail?
Is that what you really want?

And are we gonna do?

I don't know, I don't know.

We'll just have to make really intelligent
decisions right now.

Ok?

We'll just figure something out, we get out of here,

And we will fix it, it will be ok.

Alright?

Do you promise?

Come here!

I promise, I promise, it will be ok.

My God, the hair burning is making me nauseous.

Burning bodies fucking stink.

You know that bones already been cooked off right now?

Jimmy, don't do that!

You know where we're gonna go?

Where we're gonna go?

We're out to Lincoln to visit Dinko.

Who's Dinko?

Well, he has his own place and he knows about you

he wants to meet you

He doesn't like cops, so he probably
won't be inviting 'em up very much.

Could I just get a little tiny, tiny smile?
Please!

No, I just can't! I'm sorry!

Did you find the video?

Yeah.

I remember that shit! I remember that shit that you're video taping

Alright, so you guys going to stay on me?

But I gotta do business sometime in here, ok?

so it's very important for me,
when people come to the door

You can't answer the fucking door,
and you can't answer the fucking phone.

Other than that we's gonna have a fucking good time
cause I got shitload of fucking crank.

And that shit's off the fucking hook!
Do you want a hit?

No, I get the feeling Judy actually.

Hey man, you better stop taping, you gotta stop taping, ok?
'cause I got crank kids come up to smoke

and sometime to see some shit,
and you fucking put that out man.

So it's very important! Alright?

The crank kids it's a whole different fucking breed, man!

Totally unpredictable, hard to know
what the fuck they're gonna do.

Fuck!

There was this one fucking dude

he climbed upon the roof of his house
to take shit

It was the only fucking place he could take the shit
house fuck up his ass!

Jimmy, why aren't you giving your attention to me?

I'm sorry.

Do I look sexy?

You are really sexy, baby.

I got some work for
you all, if it's ok with you guys!

What kind of work?

You know, just mixing some shit out, I'll teach you!
Some hot, some good money I'll teach your girl too

if she wants to know how, ok?

Right on! That's all I have always wanted
to learn how to do.

make some crystal methamphetamine

Goddamn!

You're a genius, dude.

It is for you
Thank you.

Man...

Is it like your girlfriend? or are you all just fucking?

Yeah, she's my girlfriend, I only have one rule, man!

Please, don't ever, ever fuck it!
You understand?

You got me?
I got it.

Cool.

You like to fuck your own lady.

So... Osis.

This dude, this fucking dude.

Told me anything I know about mix
and he probably flip over your girl.

You're talking about uncle Rodney, right?

Right.

Uncle fucking Rodney.

Do you have an uncle Rodney, baby?

No, he's not my uncle, he's not anybody's uncle
remember I was telling you about

the guy that was out in the bin?

I told you we would go
to Arlinger, remember?

When was that?

We will be naked.

We're always naked, Jimmy.

Yeah, forget it.

Fuck!

Do you like that shit?

Yeah.

You gotta fucking see in here, man.

in a shit like here.

I mean, my place is cool, but...

So you ought to go up and see to it, ok?

Fuck.

Customer's call.

Baby, I am very high, right now.
It's amazing, it's great.

You having a good time?

I told you?

Jimmy, your girl in chicks?

Well Judy, are you into chicks?

I don't know, you want me to be into chicks?

Yeah, bring her in, man!

Actually, I don't know
Judy is really all that into chicks.

Now that I think about it

I'm not that really into chicks.

yeah, we do, now we won't change it.

I don't know!

I just wanna get some shit and get out of here.

Shut the fuck up, you got it?
And you fucking take your clothes off.

I don't want to.

You go on.

Jimmy.

Stop it!

He's a big man
he can do what he wants.

Now up to you, Dinko.

I'm gonna fuck this junky whore for you.

You all fucking look!

Are you gonna fuck her or
are you just gonna talk about it?

Jimmy, if you let him fuck her I swear you
that I'll never fucking talk to you again!

We gonna do some fuck time, man.

Off you go.

'cause you think that this guy deserves to die?

This faggot rapist?
Yeah. He does!

Good-bye Dinko, you stupid fuck.
Thank you for the car and for the cash.

And for the crank.

How you're feeling, baby?

I don't care about anything.

So, what are we gonna do with the car, Jimmy?

Ditch it.

And the crank?
Fucking snort it.

And the cash?

We will go on vacation anywhere you want.
How's that?

It sounds amazing.

And now the one, the only Elvis.

Alright.

I'm understanding you're couples
it's that alright in vows! The vows?

Thanks, thank you very much.

Judy, promise to always swallow,
never cut your hair

or have another man penis injected in any
part of your body for as long as you both shall live?

I do.

You Jimmy,  you promise
to always fuck Judy  with enthusiasm

to take a shower once a day and promise not to inject
your penis in any part of another person body,

as long as you both shall live!

I do.

Now the rings.

It is the best part.

According to the power invested in me

I do hereby pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride

We cut that out.

Cut the fucking crank line, baby!

Hey, you know what? What?
I got an idea.

Now that we're married I should
go to the med school and become

an anesthesiologist and
get you all the crank you want.

Really? you'd do that?
Yeah.

Jimmy, your house is on TV.

Jimmy look! Come here!
What?

...has just named two suspects in the attempted
murder of deputy Frank Mitchell

who was critically wounded after pulling over a suspected
hit and run driver two nights ago.

The two suspects are, James Wright
a 21 year old Caucasian male

And 18 years old high school senior
Judy Elizabeth Oaks Keller.

No, it's not...

Wait, wait!

And although there's no official word on his status,

sources say that the hospital
has listed him in critical condition.

The two youths were caught on tape
by an onboard video camera

mounted inside the Deputy's patrol car

The sheriff's department has released
the following footage in an effort

to help involve the public
in the search for the suspects.

On a very serious note we would like to warn our viewers
that the images you're about to see

are graphic in nature
and may not be suitable for young children.

Once again, viewer's discretion is strongly advised.

Judy, I didn't want us to be apart.

I guess people know who we are now.

Actually, we're kind of famous.

That's the most romantic thing I ever even heard of.

I love you Judy.

I love you too.

Jimmy, it's your parents.

We are very shocked
about recent events.

Our son...

has always been a dear sweet boy
who is a little confused.

But we want him to know that we love him very, very much
and we just want this whole thing to be over

Bitch!

I found the clippers, baby.

Come on, sit down, it's go time!

Ok.

Wait, wait!
What?

I just wanna to look at myself one last time.

I look so good!

Alright, that's enough!

Judy, I'm not sure about this.

Why?

Come on, I changed my hair!

I Know,  but you look beautiful
I'm gonna look like a shit.

No, you won't! It was your idea, remember?

Come on.

Ok, let's do this!

Alright.

My God!

I love you but I hate you right now.

My God.

Turn it back more.

I can't even look.

We should leave it like this.

No, I don't want to look like
male patterned baldness.

Comb it over there.
Comb it over here

I see you like this.

Come on, get serious!

God,  it feels really good.
Yeah?

Wait...

Yeah!

My God, you're such a fucking pig when you eat.

That's so gross!

That's it! I'm not taking you to the country club.

Right.

I'm sorry, did I hurt your feelings?

Ok, I'll take you to the country club, I promise.

Really? When?

I don't know.

Thank you so much for marrying me.
You're my prince in shining armor.

And one day, we'll have a white picking fence and
a big house and a little beautiful baby.

What should we name the baby?

What's wrong?

Nothing.

What, what's wrong?

Shit, give me the camera.

My God.
They're going to our door.

Shit.

They know where we are, we're gonna get caught.

Alright, let's get out of here.

Get in!

Did they see us?
I don't think so.

Think, I gotta think, I gotta think.

I don't think that they see us
I think we're ok.

My God... that was close.

Good morning.

Wake up, you little fuck nugget.

How are we doing this morning, Mrs. Wright?

Where are we?

It's a surprise.

I want you to drive this thing 'cause I want
to film you when we get there, ok?

Ok.

Come on! Get up.

When we're gonna see it?

God, I hate you when
you do this to me, just tell me!

You just keep looking!

Which further.

Just keep fucking driving.

My God, is this it?

Yeah.

Is this where your friend lives?

This is where we lives.

We do?

For a while if we want to.

My God, this is so amazing!
Do you wanna live here?

Yeah.

This is so amazing!
Like a rock concert, huh?

Look around...

We're gonna get drunk and
naked all the time.

Yeah, go over here, ok?
There?

Close to those guys.

Take it, Ok?
OK.

Is that uncle Rodney?
No, that's Buddy.

But Rodney wants to meet us.

He does?

Yeah, like we're fucking celebrities or something.

My God.

Come on, let's party!

So we got like... 35 trailers out here.

Real nice fucking trailers, I tell you, man!
They're always open you guys can crash in one.

Now, some folks might show up...
I might have to put you in a tent

Judy look! they have hairy pussies out here.

that's my girl, I make sure she keeps it trimmed, seriously!

I don't like any hair. it's disgusting!

Seriously, some people might show up and
I'd have to put you in a tent, don't fuck it, man!

Everybody's real nice out here
you'll always find a bed to crash, yes you can!

Although don't look like much
we'll fucking break you down up here.

We have some really good party up
and you can stay as long as you like.

You know what?

You all can stay forever.

Now, if you do, you gotta know
there's some rules up here, ok?

Up her it's the labs, alright?

we don't really fuck around with it.

Don't film it.

'cause Rodney he's gonna have a break.
Alright, what's rule 2?

Rule number 2

No cops! Now I got to worry about you two
bringing the cops up here,

Beyond that it's pretty much fucking that you can do
whatever the fuck you want.

Whatever the fuck you want.

Do you wanna hang with us?
You wanna do some partying, a little hang out, you know

I like you Jimmy, most of the time, most of the time
You have to sell some shit for uncle Rodney

he told me you were a very, very special case and you
are gonna need a little time to let the things cool down, right?

That might take a couple of months.

That might take a couple of years, but who
the fuck's up in a rush anyway, isn't that right?

Ready? one, two three.

Now, fuck me, look
I have you carried in our new home.

Give me a kiss.
Oh, look at that!

How do you turn this fucking thing off?
How you do that?

If you give your love to uncle Rodney
you'll get it back... like 10 times.

But don't be afraid to love him...

because you'll learn to love yourself in return

He'll teach you the sacral
and how we're all connected.

Uncle Rodney respects us,
he can be your savior.

Or your executioner, it's your choice.

I've seen him getting pissed off quite a bit
with people that steal from him.

We got a new special form, we take care of it
our own way, we don't involve the law.

We take care of it internally.

This dude I was showing with, like Matt
or something like that,

he's just gotten out of the joint 
and he was telling me

about this place where
you can like do what you want.

And not have to worry about any of 
that bullshit and other shit that goes on

That other world out there.

And I was like: Dude, that sounds cool!
So I came down, checked it out

and I was like: Yeah!

I mean this,  this what life should be!

Hey baby.

Come, that's warm.
Really?

Yeah, come on!

No, I think I'll just film you for a while.

How do I look?
Beautiful.

How do I look now?

Sexy.

Hey, cut!

Hey, again!
Hey!

Do you like it here?

How long can we stay?

That's up to Rodney.

What's he like?

I don't know! Supposedly he's weird.

Actually, I heard he's really weird.

Well, if he's weird is great weird wherever he is.

If we could stay here forever
like Buddy says.

We wouldn't need anything else.

The cops won't come, won't they?

This camera shit's fun, man.

Hey! Are you nervous?

No.

I'd be.

It's supposed to be cool, right?

Yeah man, he's cooling cool! 
But, Gosh, you really don't have any idea, do you?

Judy wants to meet him,
it's ok if I ask, right?

No, you have to, she's one of the girls now
she's going to  meet him.

What the fuck does that mean, Buddy?

Won't you relax, man? Just like
you're one of his boys.

I'll give you two weeks and you will want
her to experience him.

Might you want it too.

Just go see him, alright?. 
He wants you to feel him.

Hey man, take your camera.

Go now, they're waiting for you.

Fuck!

Are you filming?

Yeah.

Where you want me?

You sit yourself up wherever.

Ok.

So...

I want you to feel comfortable.

Do you feel comfortable?

I guess so.

The important thing is that we get this right

Please, please.

Just a second, I gotta take care of my baby.

Don't lie, don't lie!

Some people come here and
they're too far gone like Connie here.

and by the time they get here
there's nothing I can do

Except trying to ease their pain.

Ain't that right, sweetheart?

How about a little bitty baby taste?
What do you say?

Yeah, yeah.

Is that?

There's something about addiction 
brings out something beautiful in people.

See, addiction is pure.

Addiction reduces
people to infants.

And it ain't nothing so beautiful,
innocent and pure as an infant.

Connie here, is not an
adult any longer , she's an infant.

and I'm her surrogate mother

who must provide the much needed 
breast milk from time to time.

It is an arrangement that we have both
come to accept

and embrace

I love you.

You're ready?
Yeah.

Thank you.

Alright, off you go, sweetie.
Daddy's gotta do the work.

Listen! Before begin, please.

I'm gonna use this tape for my fans.,

and there's a fair number of them out there

so let's try not to fuck this up

I wanna apologize, before we start...

if what I say frightens you 
or makes you uncomfortable.

I'll be fine.

No, you will not be fine.

What I have to teach will be
frightening.

The truth is an acquired taste.

But once you get to it.

That's all you ever want.

That's all.

Now, those kids out there, we...

The undesirables...you might call us

You, me, we know the truth.

We know it, you know,
society don't want you.

Your parents don't want you.

The corporate America sure as fuck doesn't want you, 
you wouldn't be here otherwise, would you!

And if America had the chance.

If this government had the chance

They would gas us in a heartbeat.
They would exterminate us

just like the Jews
or they would enslave us.

like the niggers, 'cause make no mistake about it
we are the new niggers of this country.

Nobody respects us, nobody sees
what we have to offer.

Nobody has any compassion for us.

They don't care or they're too naive
to see that we are the fucking...

of a wasteful society that has failed

To educate, to embrace

to fulfill, to inspire any of us

we are societal garbage

There ain't no counter culture. Not anymore.

It's gone, it's dead and it was
replaced by us.

The garbage culture.

We've been tossed aside.

We've been imprisoned, 
we've been institutionalized.

We've been systematically abused.

We've been executed, we've been enlisted

into armies... started 
by governmental fuckers

with the  sole purpose of killing us off.

That's all, to kill us fucking off.

And every week...

somebody shows up at my doorstep
 and they're disillusioned and they're addicted

And they're angry and they're pissed 
'cause they've been set aside.

They've tossed out with the garbage.

Let me tell you something, 
every time somebody like that

comes and joins the garbage culture,
the garbage culture gets a little bit stronger

and they get a little bit weaker.

Until the theys and the thems
of this country run out of places

run out of places to put the garbage.

They can't put it anywhere and
it overflows into their cities

and it spills over out of the places that
they have set aside

to contain us

And we will burn down their world!

We will set fire to their world!

And we will not stop until our
rain of fire falls upon their heads.

And then we will fornicate in their ashes.

That's what is here for you.

That's what is here.

I'm glad you showed up I can't believe it.

You're having a good time?

We love it here.

I'm glad to hear it, you know,
I know what you did to Dinko.

Fuck!

You will like all we're getting to you now son.

You shut it up, now you do like?

I'm gonna rape your fucking girlfriend. 
I will rape your girlfriend, son.

How do you feel now?

Do you think he's fucking dead?
Yeah.

Let me go!

God.

Judy, sweetie, wake up on me!

What are you doing?

Come Judy, I'm getting you out of here, sweetie.

What the fuck is going on?

Baby, you're bleeding! Are you ok?

Wanna take you out, ok?

You're bleeding.

There's blood everywhere.

Will you just get into the car.
I don't feel so very well.

Don't fall asleep. Stay awake!

Stay awake.

You alright sweetie?

Fuck! I'm sorry.

Judy wake up!

Please, fuck!

Judy, Judy, wake up!

Come on, I saw you waking up a while ago.

Are you ok?

Am I with you?

Yeah, you're with me.

I'm ok.

Jimmy.

Judy, not the camera right now, ok?

No, reminds me when
we first met just you and your camera.

Remember how you used to freak me out.

Do you know how much money we have?

No, I don't know, why?

I was thinking... maybe Canada.

It's closer than Mexico.

Ok, as long as I'm 
with you, I don't care.

Actually I was thinking maybe I should take you home.

What?

I could...

write you a letter or send you a video.

Say I made you do everything they'd believe you.
Just have to say I made you do everything!

No, I don't want that.

Listen, I'll be fine, ok?
I'll be fine, just go to Canada

or you can sail on to Mexico.

I don't wanna be without you.

Judy, I know we swore on the bond
that we'll never be apart.

But...

I'll let you go, I won't be mad at you, sweetie.

No, Jimmy,

I'm staying with you and you're staying with me.
That's all there is to it!

Ok.

You're so handsome, you know that?

Jimmy, pull over, you're too fucked up to drive.

Ok.

Did you want to ask me something?

Judy, do you love me?
You know I do.

Do you know I love you, right?

Sweetie.
What?

We're fucked.
What do you mean?

Use the rear-view mirror.

It's over, we're done honey.

Pull over, it's not worth it, ok?

Judy, my God, there's a road block.

Listen...

Jimmy, just shut up, why you're being 
such a little bitch all of a sudden?

I'll tell them that I told you early
I'll them that I made you do everything.

We're staying together!

Listen, we can't fucking be together!

Yes we can, I won't sack and give you, cause I can't.

Judy, I love you.
-I love you too.

Do you hear that?

My God.

It's a barricade, stop the car.
