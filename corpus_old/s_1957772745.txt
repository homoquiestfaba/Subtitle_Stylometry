(tense foreboding music)

(gunshot cracks)

(crickets chirping)

I was trying to have a hot girl summer,

but I can't even do that no more,

because you got so much attention on you.

Really? Definitely
time for hot girl summer.

You know I can't anymore.

Oh my God.

I want to be a hoe. I can't even.

That is not on me.

Don't do that.


No.


Don't do that.

She got a new... Hold on.

Hello.

(birds chirping)

Kionna, what's wrong?

Ki, what's wrong?

Ki.

They killed Zaif.


(dramatic ominous music)

(birds chirping)

Now, thanks for stepping up

now that Zaif is no longer with us.

Shit, ain't no problem.

Hold on real quick.


Hello?

(birds chirping)

All right, I'll let her know.

(birds chirping)

Yo, we not gonna have no more problem

from that bitch ass nigga

from the South side crew.

Good, because it's get
down or lay down season.



If anyone from any of these other crews

don't wanna get down with us,

they gonna get laid down by
us and it's that fucking simple.

Shit, they're either
helping us or hurting us,

with us or against us.

Now we take over the whole fucking city.

(air whooshing)

(footsteps plodding)

Yeah, what's up Tray?

What's good, bro?

You ready to get back
to putting this work in?

I'm always ready to get
that work in, you know that.

All right, good.

Kionna wanna make sure you
100% before you come back though.

I'm not a hundred yet, but
I'm ready to get back to work.

She don't want you to rush this shit.

We got big plans lined up,

we gonna need you to be
ready for what's about to go down.

I'm ready for whatever
Kionna need me to do.


You really hungry for that work?

That's the shit I like to see.

(birds chirping)

That's how we going build this operation

with solid niggas like you.

Now that we got these
bitch ass niggas out the way

what's next?

I'm meeting with Kionna
in the next few days

about all the ins and outs.

What does it look like to you?

We gonna handle business or what?

Now, listen, this ain't official,

but the way she been talking,

I think we about to
take this whole city over.

Oh, we getting busy like that?

Mm-hmm.

Now, I can't say 100%,

but I think she wants to
be more than just the queen

of the trap house.

Mm-hmm.

The way she talking,

I think she wants to be the queen

of this whole fucking city.

She talking like she wanna
take the throne for real.

Taking her throne, that's
what the fuck I'm talking about.

I gotta meet with her
and see for sure though,

but it's definitely looking that way.

I'm gonna be back to normal soon

and then we gonna set all
these bitch ass niggas straight.

You can bet on that.

As soon as I get the rundown from her,

I'm gonna be in contact with you

and let you know what it is, the full plan.

That's what's up.

Let her know I'm ready to get back to work

and then take over this whole motherfucker.


Yeah, I know she'll be
glad to see you still on board.

We need soldiers like you
to make this work for us.

Tell Kionna I'm ready
to build this whole empire

however high she wants to take it.

All right, I'll hit you
back in a few days.

(birds chirping)

So what are you gonna
do now that Tyreke's gone?

I got a couple options I'm looking at.

What do you mean by that?

Nesha, I'm not gonna lie to you.

Okay.

There's some things I still wanna do

with Tyreke's operation.

Oh, I know you're
still involved in that shit.

Believe me, I know.

How do you know what I'm doing out here?

You don't think I don't hear

what you do in these streets?


Girl.

So much for trying
to fly under the radar.

You know how it is out here, girl.

These motherfuckers do not
keep their damn mouth shut.

So what are you doing?

Just keeping track of what I'm doing?

I mean, I knew that
you weren't gonna just

jump right out of the game
because Tyreke is gone.

And I knew when you said,
"He was only going to help him

"until he got home," it was some bullshit.

Okay, look, I did not expect things

to go down the way they did.

(birds chirping)

What really did happen to Tyreke?

I don't know, shit happens, I guess.

(birds chirping)

Yeah, okay.

I think it may be something like,

hell happened (indistinct)
like a woman's born.


(birds chirping)

I heard he got to
beef with niggas in jail.

Mm-hmm.

And shit went sideways.

Yeah, some niggas you paid for.

Girl, you are wild as a hell for that.

Fuck.

I can't blame you though.

Damn Nesha, you wearing a wire?

(footsteps plodding)

On some real shit though,

he deserved everything he got.

(birds chirping)

Fuck him, really fuck him.

Yeah.
All right?

I never liked that nigga anyway.

That's what I'm saying.

Fuck him and fuck every
other bitch ass nigga

that tried to stop me from taking over.

(birds chirping)

Okay.

So seriously though, you do plan

on leaving this street
shit behind you, right?

Yes, when the time is right.

I still got some unfinished business

I need to take care of.

I just don't want you to
get so caught up in the life

that you can't even find your way out.


I know what you're saying.

I hope so Kionna.

Shit can flip on you really fast.

Look, I got everything under control.

We all have control until we don't.

I just need a little bit more time

get some things lined up for the long game.

I got bigger plans than this.

(air whooshing)

Just don't get caught up in the bullshit.

(footsteps plodding)

(birds chirping)

(footsteps plodding)

All right, well, this Friday,

everything will be finalized

and you will officially

own all of Tyreke's former
legal business entities,

Everything that Tyreke owned

that was legit will now be yours.

Okay, and I shouldn't have any problems

with any family members or some bitch

he might have been fucking behind my back

trying to take this from me, right?

That's correct.

That's good

because I definitely don't
want any problems like that.

Tyreke didn't have a will in place, so

because he gave you temporary ownership,

when he passed away,

everything automatically reverted to you.

By this Friday, it'll be official.

And you made sure he didn't have any kids

I didn't know about that could be coming

asking for money years from now?

No, Tyreke didn't have any
children that we could locate.

Okay, I didn't think he had any kids,

but Tyreke didn't tell me so much,

I just wanted to clarify that.

No, of course, that doesn't
mean that, down the road,

someone couldn't file some bullshit lawsuit

saying that they were entitled
to some of his businesses

or some of the money, something like that.

But if something like that
should come down the pike,

I'll file a motion right
away to have it dismissed.

And you'll let me know first thing,

if something like that does happen, right?

Absolutely.

Okay, good.

So now the bigger question,

now that you have this
empire in the palm of your hand,

what do you plan on doing?

I'm still working on all that.


Are you gonna be
done with all this street shit

or are you still gonna be involved in that?

I eventually plan to cut all that out

but I do have a few
things that I still need to get

before I cut all ties
with the trap house shit.

Listen, it's not my place to say.

I mean, I'm your lawyer, I work for you,

but I just think it would
be wise of me to say

if you stay in this too long

and eventually the heat
that came down on Tyreke

will eventually come down on you.

That's just the nature of
this whole drug game shit.

I mean, shit, look at the biggest

drug dealers in the world,

El Chapo, Pablo Escobar, you name it,

eventually everybody gets caught.

I appreciate your concern,

but understand I've got this covered, okay?

I'm not trying to make a career
out of running trap houses.

I'm smarter than that.


Well, I'm glad to hear you say that

because the retirement plan

for drug dealers fucking sucks, okay?


Oh yeah, I know just
how fucked up it can get.

Look Kionna, you're smart.

You're smart enough to
turn this into a legal operation.

That way, you don't have to
worry about any of the heat

that would come down on you

from running an illegal operation.

Did you give Tyreke this same speech?

Well, maybe not word for word,

but I would definitely always try

to drive home the same point.

Mm-hmm, and I guess he never listened.

Never.

I worked with Tyreke for years

and would constantly try to tell him

to get out of this street life,

but he just loved it too much.

He just fucking loved that lifestyle.

It was like his comfort zone.

Always running and
gunning, ducking and dodging.

He just loved that shit, man.

I mean, he really enjoyed it.

Well, this trap shit

is definitely not my comfort zone, okay?

And I agree with you, I'm way too smart

to be in this ship for the long run.

(air whooshing)

(birds chirping)

(paper rustling)

So where are we taking
the empire from here?

(paper rustling)

We need to continue
to grow this operation

and build on the areas we have locked down.

I like that idea.

Capitalize on everything we gotta grip on.

Exactly, we push more work

and expand into other parts of the city.

That ain't gonna be no problem,


Streets already talking,

Queen Kionna, running shit for real.


Yeah, taking out that suck ass nigga

from the South side crew,

exactly what we needed
to let all these niggas

know what time it is out here.

That, and the way you
handled that boy, Tyreke,

let them motherfuckers know you not the one

to be fucked with.

I think they got the
message loud and clear.

No doubt, you start zipping
up niggas in body bags,

ain't no way they gonna
misunderstand that shit.

Hey, shit had to be done.

I feel what you saying.

So I told you from day
one, show no weakness.

Have you talked to Jay lately?

Yeah, I talked to him the other day.

How's he doing? He all right?

Yeah. He good.

Said he ready to get
back to putting his work in.

You tell him what I said?

Yeah, I told him what you said.

You ain't coming back until
you 100% back to normal.

How long until you
think he'll be back 100%?

Shit, you ask him,

he ready to get back to
putting that work in now,


But I think he still
need a little more time.

I mean, he's still walking
around with that shit on his

own.

[Kionna] Oh no.
He fucked up for real.

No, I can't have no lines
with three legs out here.

I need him ready to go when he ready to go.

Oh, he gonna be good to go soon.

All right, perfect.

Look, I wanted to
bring my cousin on board

while Jay getting this up together.

Just wanted to see
what you think about that.

He's solid, right?


Come on now, you
know me better than that.

I wouldn't even consider it
if he was a lame ass nigga.

What's his background?

He did a little work
for me back in the day,

but he had to leave,
but he back in town now.

I'm ready getting him back to work.

All right, I mean, if you
can vouch for the nigga

and he a solid soldier,
we could definitely use him,

especially while Jay's still out.

All right, I'm gonna hit him up,

let him know I got some work for him.

Well, wait, he not
on parole or probation,

or no shit like that, right?


Oh no, he been
home with all that all shit.

All right, because we need
to lay low under the radar

from any of these cops.

Always.

I can't have no fucking
PO keeping track of nobody

in this operation.

I'm gonna give him a
call, you know what I mean?

Bring him up to speed
with what we got going on.

All right, cool.

Make that happen ASAP.


Consider it done.

(paper rustling)

What up CUZ?

Hey, what up nigga?

Shit, I talked to Kionna about
you coming to work with us.

Yeah? (Sighs)

What'd she say?

Shit, she said, if I can
vouch for you and you solid,

I can go ahead and put you on some work.


Hell yeah, man, that's what's up.

Shit, I need to start stacking some bread.


And I told her you was
a bitch ass nigga for real.

(Darrell laughs)

You ain't no street nigga,

you one of them called
them banks ass niggas

or what we call them banks type nigga.

Nigga, shut the up fuck up, yo.


But for real, she said, you good to go.


I'm gonna show you something, man.

(gun bangs)

Oh shit, nigga.

What you working with?

Come on now nigga.

You know I'm ready to
get a cracker whenever.

You ain't got nobody
doing this motherfucker, right?

Nah, nigga.

It's all good, man.

This nigga ready to go
day one, straight out the gate.

You know that CUZ,

just give me the word and
tell me who needs to get got.

Shit, you for real,
ready to put this work in?

Yo, putting holes in niggas
ain't nothing new to me CUZ.

(chuckles)
Nigga, chill.

Get me hyped over here,

ready to go shooting the block up for fun.

You already know.

You wild CUZ.

Yo, but for real, tell Kionna,
I appreciate the work, man.

Whatever she needs to get done,

just say the word and that shit is done.

That's what's up.

And like I told you the other
day we finna take this shit

to a whole new level.

Well, what's the first
thing you need me to do?

We gonna meet up with Jay

and he gonna fill you in with all the shit

he take care of.

All right, bet.

Yo CUZ, you came back
to town at the right time.

Shit about to get real serious for real.

Hell yeah, let's take this shit over.

(wind whooshing)

(birds chirping)

Yo, what's good bro?

What's up baby?

(birds chirping)

Hey look, this is my
cousin, Darrell, right here.

What's up yo?
Awesome.

What happened to you?

It's all good, just a
little bitch ass nigga

trying to take me out.

Yo, OPS caught you lurking?


Nigga, never that.

This came within the crew.

Shit, wasn't nothing we couldn't handle.

The motherfucker that did this to Jay,

was just plotting on some snake shit.

He's dead motherfucking now,

so we ain't gotta worry
about his punk ass anymore.

All right, enough with the chit chat,

let's get down to business.

(birds chirping)

Look, this is the plan,

we going to have Darrell working with you

till you get back to 100%.

All right, cool.

I need you to show
him all the day to day shit

that you do, how you watch the block,

and how you move the product around.

You seem like you
put in some work before.


Yeah, I've been around the
block a couple of times, man.

I ain't no rookie at this shit.

Then it should be easy
to get you up on speed

in all the shit we got going on.

Jay, I need you to show
Darrell how we do the pick ups,

the drop offs, everything.

When you get back to normal,

I'ma have Darrell move
to a whole nother location.

(birds chirping)

So what's Kionna said
about expanding operation?

We taking this shit over over or what?

That's the game plan.

As we expand and take
over other areas of the city,

I'ma have Darrell moving
to the new positions

and you gonna stay with the ones you in.

Show me exactly how
all this shit gets done,

that way when the time is right,

I can just move to another
area, I'm gonna set up shop.

Yeah, no problem.

I got you.

I'm going update Kionna

let her know that y'all two
gonna be working together

until you get back on your feet.

Hell yeah nigga, let's stack this money.

And remember, Kionna wants heads up

on any possible problems,

whether it's cops, OPS,
or anything, all right?

So you want me to
roll with Jay right now?

Yeah, hang with Jay.

I'm gonna go meet with Kionna

and see what's the next move after this.

(birds chirping)

(footsteps thumping)

Oh, shit.

(breathing deeply)

(birds chirping)

Hey, excuse me.

Yeah.

You got the time, my cell phone down?

You're joking, right?


All right, you got me.

Listen, I saw a beautiful woman

and that was the first
thing I thought to say.

Yeah, that's what I thought.

All right, listen, at least
I was honest about it.

I could have kept it going,

act like my phone was really dead.

Oh, so you think you get
points for coming clean so soon?

I don't know, do I?

I gotta go.

All right, wait.

Can I just buy you lunch
for disturbing your jog?

I'm good, I can buy my own lunch.

Okay, damn.

Independent woman, I like that.

I gotta get going.

All right, wait.

All right, how about you
just take my number?

Just take my number, if
you change your mind and...

You know what I mean?

You could just text me.

Are you always this
persistent with everyone

you meet in the park?

I don't know, at this point, I mean,

I don't even think you would believe me.

(scoffs)
You right, I wouldn't.

All right, how about
you just take my number,

if you change your mind, we can be friends.

Oh, so now you wanna be friends

because at first you just
wanted to buy me lunch,

but now we done, jump to friends?


You move fast, Mr. Whoever you are.

All right, I'm Davon, and you are?

Kionna.

Kionna, that is a beautiful
name for a beautiful woman.

Okay Davon, you can dial it down.

All right, so what do you say?

(birds chirping)

(air whooshing)

(birds chirping)

So what's the deal with your cousin?

He ready to come on board?

Shit, I already got him with Jay.

He ready to put this work in.

Okay, good, because we
need him to learn this operation

as quick as he can.

I told him we gonna be expanding

and we gonna need him
to take over new area.

Is he planning on being
with us on a long term basis

or is he just trying to make
some money real quick?

Nah, he ain't at the win,

he trying to grow with the operation.

All right, because we
need soldiers to grow.

Yeah, I talked with him a little bit

about what you planning on doing?

And what's he think about all this?

Shit, he down.

He said he ready to get
the real money and real work.

All right.

You talked to Jay,

how much more time you think he gonna need?

I say we give him about another week,

he should be ready to get
back work full time by then.

All right, get him on
the phone real quick.

I wanna talk with him.

Yo.

Yo Tray, what's up?

Kionna wanna holler at you.

Hey Jay, what's going on?

You healing all right?

Yeah, what's up Kionna?

Yeah, I'm starting to feel better.

Good, because we need you back out here

on a full time schedule,

but I don't wanna rush it

if you ain't ready to come back out yet.

Yeah, I understand what you're saying.

So what are you thinking?

You'd be good in about a week or so?

Hell yeah, no doubt.

I'll be ready by then.

Good, because I got some work

I need you to handle.

Whatever you need me to do.

I'm gonna have Tray give it
to you by the end of the week

and I'm gonna let you know
what's going on with all that.

All right, cool.

What's Darrell looking like?

Is he a good fit for this operation?

Yeah, he ain't new to this shit.

He just needs to see
how we run our operation

and he'll be ready to
be on his own in no time.

All right, good.

That's exactly what I want to hear.

All right, look, I'ma feel
Tray in, with all the details,

he gonna get up with you by
the end of the week, all right?

Not a problem.

All right.

Yo, I'ma hit you back
a little later, all right?

So I got some things I gotta put in place

then I'm gonna need
Jay to handle it for me.

Shit, just let me know.

All right.

(crickets chirping)

So what took you so long to finally call?


And I thought you had
my number blocked this long

but I guess not.

Is that what other chicks do to you

when you give them your number?


I'd be lying if I said
it ain't never happen.

Should I take that as a warning sign?

I mean, maybe those chicks
can see something I can't,

maybe they can see that
you're nothing but trouble.

Nah, it ain't nothing like that.

You sure?

I'm positive.

All right, so what's the plan?

You still buying me lunch?

I thought you said you
could buy your own lunch.

I can, but I wanted to see if
you were a man of your word.

All right, I got you.

Yeah, I can do that.

The way you were talking the other day

seemed like you was
the one with all the bread.

Why you say that?

I don't know, it was just
the vibe you had going.

It seemed like you was
somebody who was just successful

and driven, I don't know.

Am I wrong?

No, it is something like that.


Nah, it seemed like a low key flex to me.

No, it's nothing like that.

I was just letting you know

I'm not one of these dumb bitches out here

that's about to get excited

over a man buying her lunch like...

All right, I got you.

It ain't nothing wrong with that.

I hope you're not intimidated by a woman

who can stand on her own.

Nah, never that.

For real, let me be honest with you,

I think it's sexy as fuck.

I mean, who would want a woman

who can't stand on her own?

How about this, meet
me in the park tomorrow,

I'll let you be my jogging partner.

If you can keep up with me,
I might let you buy me lunch.

(chuckles)
All right, I can do that.

Do what? Meet me in the
park or keep up with me?

Both.

(chuckles)
Okay, we'll see.

All right, the only thing
I need you to figure out

is what you want for lunch

because I ain't worried
about keeping up with you.

All right, don't get
too over confident now.

Nah, I just gotta good
feeling about it for real,

that's all.

All right, well, I'll text you tomorrow

when I'm on my way to the park.

All right, because I'm gonna be waiting.

All right, bye.

All right, bye.

So what's new in your world?

Well, I met a new guy
who seems pretty nice,

and girl, he fine as hell.

I knew something was up.

How is that?

You had like this, "I found
a new man," step in your walk

when you first came in.

Girl, wait, no.

So you're saying, I'm walking differently

because I met a new guy?

Oh well, hell yes.

It's written all over your face.

You even got a funny little grandeur smile.



Damn, is it that noticeable?

Of course it is.

I mean to me anyway, because
I've known you for so long.

I can always tell when you find a new man.

Damn, I gotta try to
make it less obvious.

So what's his name?

Davon.

Davon.


He already sound like a player.

He probably got like ten baby mamas

running around here somewhere.

Well, I just recently met him,

so I'm still getting to know him.

Girl.

Okay, you will need to do
some background on his ass,

you are a powerful woman now.

Okay.

Niggas can try to plot on
you any way that they can.

He seems like a nice guy so far.

I'm pretty sure you said
the same thing about Tyreke

and look where that ended up.

Okay, no.

Nesha, you know that was different.

I'm serious, Kionna.

You need to watch your every move.

You need to be careful about
who you let come around you.

Okay, I'll make sure

that he's not a serial killer

or some shit like that.

You mean to tell me
you haven't done that yet?

No, I just met him.

We only met once, we only
talked on the phone once.

Let's be honest, you have
one hell of a track record

when it comes to finding a man.

No, you just always
see the worst in people.

I mean, come on, am I wrong?

(breathes deeply)

Okay, you know what? Okay.

Maybe the last few guys I
talked to weren't good picks.

I'm woman enough to admit that.

Okay, see, that's why
we've been friends for so long

because I can see what
you can't or maybe it's just,

you don't wanna see these things.

Look, I will get to know him

before anything gets serious with him.

Yes, thank you.

Please, do it for your sake and mine.

So should I hire a private
investigator for Davon?

Maybe have him get followed?

See if he's going to another woman's house?


Okay, see now you play too much.


All right, I found out
all the info I can on him,

but really am sure he's okay.

(exhales sharply)

There you go again.

There I go again what?

Kionna, you don't know
shit about this motherfucker.

You already say, "And I'm sure he's okay."

You don't know if that's
for sure or not, do you?

Okay, no.

I am not 100% sure that Davon

is the nicest guy in the world,

but I'll do my background on him

and I'll see what he's about.

You probably don't
even know his last name.

I told you I just met the man.

I know you all too well.

How the fuck did I know

that you didn't know
this nigga's last name?

I'm on it, okay?

I promise, I'll get his last name,

I'll get more info on him.

I don't know what the hell
I'm gonna do with you girl.

Stop it.

I'm serious, you're too damn much.

(breathes deeply)

(car honking)

(indistinct chatter)

Well, everything's been finalized,

you officially own all
of Tyreke's businesses

or former businesses, I guess I should say.

Perfect, that's exactly
what I wanna hear.

Now, last time we talked,

you mentioned you were gonna get rid

of all the illegal trap house shit

and you were just gonna go legit.

I mean, you're still gonna do that, right?

Yeah, that's correct.

I plan to only do business legally.

I'm not trying to end up like Tyreke.

Now, I'm guessing
your plan is to find a way

to funnel all of the illegal proceeds

into the legal businesses, am I right?

Yep, that's the game plan.

Okay, because I have a guy

who specializes in that kind of thing.

What exactly does this guy do?

Well, technically he's
a "financial advisor",

but he's helped many of my clients

when they needed to transfer illegal funds

to a legitimate business.

Okay, did Tyreke ever work with this guy?

No, but I always tried to get him to.

I mean, Tyreke was a
little bit of a hard head.

Sure, you knew that.

He always wanted to do things his way.

Or so he thought.



Yeah, or so he thought.

You see, Tyreke never
planned on going legit.

That was his biggest problem.

That's why he was always getting wrapped up

in some bullshit.

He just never wanted to quit.

Damn, that's exactly what
my mother used to tell me

when we were together.

I mean, it's not like I didn't try.

I used to talk to Tyreke all the time

about how he should stop
doing this trap house shit

but he just loved it and had
no intentions on ever stopping.

I guess, he was just
addicted to that life.

He must have been because
I would try to convince him

all the time to leave that life behind,

but he wasn't trying to hear any of that.

I mean, I even talked to him about this guy

I'm telling you about,
how to transfer the funds,

and he didn't want to hear
it, he just had no desire.

I had this guy send over some paperwork.

I mean, it really laid
out how it could be done

and he didn't even look at it.

Well, that sure as hell
ain't gonna be me, okay?

I can guarantee you that.

So that's why Tyreke
never worked with him.

I mean, Tyreke only
used the legal businesses

to circumvent money
into the banking system,

he never had any intention on shutting down

any of these trap houses
that he was running.

Okay, wow.

Well, I'm not ready to shut
down any trap houses just yet,

but when I do, I'm gonna
need you to contact me

with this guy, this financial advisor,

so I can transfer all my funds.

Not a problem.

Just let me know when
you're ready to do it.

Okay, so what else is going on

with all these new businesses I got?


Everything's going well,
no problems to report at all.

And you haven't
received any bullshit calls

from any bitch claiming
to be Tyreke's baby mama

asking for money, right?

Nah, nothing like that at all.

Okay, good.

Maybe I'm looking into this way too much

but I gotta be honest with you,

I was a little surprised that
no one came looking for money

or any type of opportunity,
you know what I mean?

I thought for sure I was gonna get

at least one phone call about that.

I mean, somebody asking for something,

a piece of a business
or a check for this or that.

So what are you saying?

I mean, again, maybe
I'm just over thinking this.

No, Brandon, I'm serious.

What do you think that means?

(breathes deeply)

I'm just saying be careful, okay?

I mean, I don't want you to be paranoid.

Hell, maybe I'm being paranoid.

Okay, let's say you're
not being paranoid,

what do you think is
lurking around the corner?

Maybe nothing at all,

but it almost seemed like it was too quiet,

like it was too easy or something,

almost like the calm before the storm.

Is there something that
gives you an indication

that a storm is coming?

I mean, nothing that I
can point to exactly and say,

"This is why," but I just find it odd

that no one at all came
for any of Tyreke's money

or anything at all that
used to be Tyreke's.

Well, I think you're over thinking it.

Tyreke is dead and I'm in charge now,

and it's just that simple.


Maybe I am, but in all
seriousness, Kionna be careful.

(birds chirping)

So what are these dinner
plans you keep talking about?

All right, well, I never told you,

but I am one hell of a cook.

Okay, so you can make toast

or pop something in the microwave?

Now, I bet you can make some
banging oodles and noodles.

Still got these jokes,
nah, some real shit.

I got some skills in the kitchen.

So let me guess, you wanna cook me dinner

instead of taking me to a nice restaurant?

You sure you're not just being cheap?

You still coming with these jokes.


All right, I'm just playing.

I actually think it would
be very sweet of you

for you to cook for me.

Yeah, well, I mean, have you
ever had a man cook for you?

Now that you mention
it, I don't think so.

But you know I ain't talking

about just putting a
hot pot in the microwave

and then handing it to you, right?

Okay, so now you got jokes.

No, I'm damn near a
professional chef in the

kitchen.

Okay, let's not get too confident now,

I ain't tried your cooking yet.

I promise you, you gonna love my cooking.

Mm-hmm, so where'd you learn to cook?

I mean around the way here and there.

Okay, self taught.

I mean, what can I say?

I mean, I'm a fast learner.

You know what I mean?

Nah, but for real, my mom was a good cook

and I was just watching
her as a kid growing up

and it was something
that I always liked to do.

Okay, so this is no bullshit,

you really know how to cook?

No bullshit, I got skills.

(chuckles)
All right.

Okay, so how about this?

You make me your favorite meal.

Okay, I can make that happen tonight.

Tonight?

Tonight, yeah, why?

You got all the plans already?

No, my schedule is clear tonight.

All right, cool.

I mean, I'll just text you my address

and then you just let me know

what time is good for you to come through.

I think you got yourself a date.

All right, cool, I'm gonna be waiting.

All right, sounds like a plan.

(spoon scratching)

All right, listen, I gotta tell you,

my timing is usually a
little more on point than this.

Oh, really?

(spoon scratching)

Listen, but when you texted me

and said that you were
gonna be running late,

I turned all of the temperature down

on the oven and all of that.

Oh, so me running late is the reason

why the food isn't being done on time?

I mean, when you texted me

and said that you was running late,

I mean, I just changed
things up a little bit,

but honestly what I should have did,

I should have just left
everything the same way

and we could have just popped it

in the microwave when you got here.

Yeah, because maybe I
was running late on purpose

to see how you would handle the situation

Mr. Professional Chef.

Yeah, you say it.

So you telling me that you were testing me?

Mm-hmm.

All right, I know what it was.

You were in that shit
parked around the corner,

you was just trying to
see if a delivery man

was dropping the food off or something.

Yeah, let's go with that one.


(tense foreboding music)

(car tires screeching)

(guns firing)

(tense foreboding music)

Hey yo, what's going on Jay?

Them niggas from 18th
Street pulled on one of my spots

just started busing.

You know who it was?

Nah, tone said with them niggas

that be hanging on the
avenue at the liquor store.

Yo, who got hit?

Lil Kev and Zaif got hit.

They're gonna make it?

I don't know, them niggas look fucked up.

Yo, we gotta do something
about them motherfuckers, man.

Look, I'm gonna get
on the phone with Kionna

and see what the fuck
she want us to do about this.

So I gotta be straight up with you,

if this dinner doesn't go right,

you do have a plan B, right?


Oh, plan B?

Damn, you really don't trust
my cooking at all, do you?

I mean, I don't know you
talking about this time situation

like it's gonna be a problem.

Nah, I promise it's gonna
be fine, you're gonna love it.

Because we can always order pizza

if that's cool with you, right?


Nah, I promise you, you gonna love it.

(phone buzzing)

(tense foreboding music)

(birds chirping)


Sorry about that.

Oh, who the heck? Your baby daddy?

What? He keep track of you

or something?

No baby and no baby daddy,
nobody keeps track of me.

Yeah, all right, my bad.

It's all good.

(tense foreboding music)

Fuck.

She got a green light to
clip these niggas or what?

Man, she cut her fucking phone off.

Why the fuck she do that?

I don't know what the fuck
she got going on right now.

So what's the plan?

Are we gonna ride down on
these bitch ass niggas or what?

Tray, we gonna have to do something,

we can't let them slide on us.

(tense foreboding music)

Yeah, you right yo.

Fuck it, we gonna fix this shit right now.

I ain't waiting for Kionna to call me back.

That's right.

They can't shoot up
one of our blocks today,

and think they're gonna
walk away from that shit.

Let's get payback right now.

(tense foreboding music)

Yo, you know where
them niggas be chilling at?

Hell yeah nigga.

I got one of my bitches keeping an eye

on them motherfuckers right now.

All right, let's go dump
these motherfuckers.

(tense foreboding music)

(dramatic ominous music)

Yo, I think is one of them right there.

(dramatic ominous music)

Y'all stay here, I'm gonna handle this.

(gun cocking)

(dramatic ominous music)

(gunshot cracks)

(dramatic ominous music)

(footsteps thumping)

Yo, what the fuck did y'all niggas do

without my permission?

We did what needed to be done.

(sighs)
Have you seen

the fucking news?

It looks like fucking a war is going on.

It is a fucking war going on.

Some niggas from 18th Street
ran up on one of Jay's block

shot the whole fucking block up.

You should have waited
till you got word from me

before you made a move.

I called your phone and
you shut your phone off.

You still should have waited
till you got word from me.

We didn't have time to wait.

Jay had a location, we
had to make a move fast.

Do you know how much heat
this is gonna bring down on us?

What the fuck was I supposed to do?

Let them niggas that did this shit

think it's all good?

Yo, you know we
gotta do this the right way

or everything gets fucked up.

But I told you that
shit from the beginning.

(dramatic ominous music)

Then why the fuck did
you shut your phone off

and you knew I was calling?

I was gonna call you right back,

I was in the middle of something.

Yeah, like what?

Getting fucked by this
new nigga you talking to?

What the fuck did you just say to me?

Ever since you've been
talking to this new nigga,

yo, your head ain't been right.

What? Are you jealous
because you ain't fucking me?

Is that what this is about, Tray?

Don't even say no dumb shit.

You know it ain't nothing like that.

Then what the fuck is the problem?

Because you went over my head

and killed two niggas
from 18th Street, period.

Ki, I don't know who this motherfucker is

you talking to, or fucking, or whatever.

I don't give a fuck what y'all doing,

but he got your head fucked up.

You know what? I
think it might be your head

that's fucked up.

I've been noticing how
flashy you've been lately,

you don't think I get calls every day,

talking about how you run around town,

flexing with all this new money you got?

Who the fuck you getting calls from?

Ain't nobody calling
you saying shit about me.

You ain't think I heard about that bitch

at the strip club on 49th that
you spend all your money on?

Man, fuck that bitch.

Yeah, uh-huh, so
much for staying low key.

But I never not answer
when you calling me,

I never not pick up.

Yo, I was gonna call you right back.

Yeah, but you didn't and
I had a decision to make.

Well, You made the wrong decision.

It's not the way I see it.

(scoffs)
Well, now,

I gotta figure out how to fix your fuck up.

It's like that?

Yeah nigga, it's like that.


All right, bet.

You know what? Since this motherfucker

is so important to you,

won't you get him to
do my jobs from now on?

(Kionna scoffs)

Because I'm done with this shit.

Now, Tray, what the
fuck are you talking about?

You are the queen, you'll figure it out.

Yo, stop talking that dumb shit.

For real yo, I'm done.

Tray.

Oh yeah.

(dramatic ominous music)

(birds chirping)

You might wanna get rid of that,

there's a body on there.

Matter of fact, get
your new little boyfriend

to help you with that because I'm done.

(dramatic ominous music)



(footsteps plodding)

(air whooshing)

(birds chirping)

So you know word got back to me.

Oh yeah, about what?

I heard that Tray quit.


Damn, how'd you hear about that?

Girl, I got ears everywhere.

You should know this by now.

(sighs)
Well, he made a decision

without my okay

and it turned into a problem.

You sure it didn't have nothing to do

with this new guy you're talking to?

Davon?

It has nothing to do with him.

Tray made a decision

that really fucked some things up and...

Why would you even ask

about Davon like he's the problem?

Because it seems like since
this guy's been coming around,

things have been a little off.

I don't know why you would say that.

Everything's been the same.

You have been acting different lately.

Oh wow, okay.

Now, you sound like Tray.

You overlooked things that
you've never overlooked before.

Tray made a decision without my okay,

there's nothing I overlooked.

So you're telling me that he just ran off

and did some random ass shit,

and didn't tell you nothing about it,

and called you, didn't
text you or anything?

He called me, but I was busy

and he should have waited
until I called him back.

What were you busy with?

I was having dinner with Davon.

Okay, see, there it is.

Now, you run a big empire
and you get a call from a person

that's number two in the operation

and you're too busy to take the call

because of a dinner date, are you serious?

It's not like I was never
going to call him back,

I just couldn't take the call right then.

(birds chirping)

You couldn't take the call right then

or you didn't want to
take the call right then?

You know what Nesha,

it's really not that big of a deal.

It was a big deal to Tray

and you weren't there
to show him how to move.

Yeah, well he should know

not to green light a
motherfucker without my okay.

He had to make an executive decision

and you were not there
to tell him how to move.

He made a problem even
worse than it already was, he did.

Okay, all I'm saying is that

I've seen how you took
what Tyreke started, right?

And you grew it into this large operation.

Yes I did, indeed.

Okay, so then don't fuck up

because a guy is coming around.

I'm not gonna fuck anything up.

(birds chirping)

(paper rustling)

Oh my God.

(engine revs)

(table thumping)

Yo, what's up Ki?

What's going on, Jay?

Just out here, making sure
that money keeps coming in.

How's it looking out there?

No problems, right?

Nah, no problems.

You heard from Tray lately?

Not since he came through
and told me he was quitting.

(sighs)
Listen, I'm gonna need you

to step up in this operation.

Not a problem, okay, I got you,

but we gonna need more help

because I can't run
everything without more people.


You hear from Darrell?

Nah, I think he left when Tray left.

Shit.

We need to rebuild if
Tray ain't coming back.

This nigga all in his feelings and shit.

You want me to see if I
can round some people up?

I probably get one or two solid niggas

if we need to real quick.

Let's hold off on that for now

and see how everything plays out first.

You think Tray gonna come back around?

I don't know what the fuck he's gonna do.

I've called him, I text
him, and his little stupid ass

ain't even text me back or call.

I could try to reach out to
him and see what his plan is,

but he was fucking mad at
shit last time I talked to him.

Nah, don't reach out to him,

I want to talk to him first.

We can't let the OPS know
we got internal problems.

If they get word on any of this shit,

they gonna think we weak.

Yeah, I know, we can't let anybody know

about any of this bullshit.

These motherfuckers out
here would think we falling apart

and will try to take some
of these blocks back.

Nah, we definitely can't have that.

Hell no.

(inhales deeply)

All right, look, I'm gonna
think about what I'm gonna do.

(exhales sharply)

I'll hit you back once I figure
out my next move, all right?

All right, cool.

(exhales sharply)

Until then, just keep that
motherfucking money coming in

and keep watching them blocks, all right?

No doubt, I'm gonna
keep this shit locked down

until you give me word on our next move.

All right, cool, I'll hit you later.

All right.

What's wrong?

You seem like you got a
lot weighing on your mind.

I'm just dealing with
a lot of shit right now.

Like what?

Some shit that you
don't care to know about.

What? Like all that
street shit you got going on?

Wait, what do you mean?

That shit you got
going on in the streets.

What do you know about that?


Come on girl, stop playing.

You think I don't know this shit

that you got going on out here.

You never mentioned it to me before,

I just thought you didn't
know about all that other stuff.

Hell yeah, I know about all that.

I even know about how Tray quit on you.

How do you know about that

and I never even talked to you about that?

I mean, I have to.

Man, you already know
that these people around here

can't keep a secret to
save their fucking life.

Why didn't you ever talk
to me about this before?

It just never really came up.

So what do you know about Tray?

Fuck that nigga, you
don't need him anyway.

Do you know Tray?

All I know is you don't need him.

Do you know Tray?

I mean, we grew up
together and all of that,

but I mean the bottom line is

you don't need anybody

that's just going to get up
and bounce on you like that.

I never even knew you
was in the streets like that.

I'm not in the streets like that,

but I do my little thing here and there.

You sound like a real street nigga.

I never got this
impression from you before.

I ain't, so you know
all I've been up in like,

"You is nothing like
that," but I do my thing.

All right.

But listen, I've been meaning to ask you.

While we on this topic,

I need you to do me a little favor.


What kind of favor?

All right, I need you to
help my boy move this week,

and I wanted to ask if you
could help me with that?

Wait, so you trapping too?

I just really need to
help my boy real quick

so that I could try to get
this extra cash, you feel me?

So what do you need from me?

All right, I'm going to need
you to pick up some product

and the only thing is

I might just need to
move it to your trap house.

Pick it up from who?

From me.

I mean, I'll call you with the
date and times and all that

when I get everything
finalized and all that.

So you want me to funnel your boys' drugs

through my operation?

No, I mainly want you to
hold some weight for me,

but I mean, if we can unload something too,

I mean that's even better, right?


I mean, I guess I can make some calls

and try to make it happen.

I guess I can help you with this.

I would really appreciate it

if you can help me with this.

And this is just a one time thing, right?

Absolutely, just one time.


All right, I'm gonna have
to move some things around,

I gotta let my crew know what's going on.

All right, listen, but believe me,

I really would not ask you this

if I didn't really need
your help with this.

I mean, I just need to make
this quick cash real quick.

The problem was my boy
had offered me this opportunity.

All right, look, I'll
make it happen, okay?

All right, listen, I appreciate you.

(breathes deeply)

Yo, what's up Ki?

Jay, listen, I need you
to change some things up

for this new side project I'm working on.

All right, what do you need me to do?

I need to help somebody move some weight.

What kind of weight you talking?

Just a little something,
it's no big deal.

So what do you need me to do?

I'm gonna run it through
one of our trap houses,

but I need to make sure that this product

stays separate from our product.

All right, so you want me
to stop moving our product?

Just for a bit

and then we can get
back to running what's ours.

Why are we doing this?

Is something wrong with
the product we pushing out?

No, I just need to do
a favor for someone.

You need me to pick something up for you?

No, I'm gonna handle it,

I just need you to make
room for this new shit

we about to get.

Where are we getting this new shit from?

Is it better quality?

Look, you don't need
to worry about all that.

All right, whatever you need.

All right, so I'm gonna
go pick this shit up,

I'm gonna set it at one of the traps,

and then I'm gonna let you know

what the next move is, right?

Ki, are you sure you wanna be sitting

on a large shipment like that?

Jay, do I need to remind you
who the fuck is running shit?

Nah, but I'm saying, I
don't think it's good for you

to be holding that much weight.

Jay, again, why do I need to remind you

who the fuck is running this shit?

My bad Ki, I'm just
trying to look out for you.

Well, yeah, I appreciate you

but you just need to
take orders, you got me?

Ain't no problem.

I'll make sure we separate the new product

when you tell me to.

All right, now I'm gonna get back at you

when everything is set up.

All right, cool.

(birds chirping)

(breathes deeply)

(paper rustling)

(footsteps thumping)

(table thuds)

(exhales sharply)

Damn, that's a lot of weight.

Yeah, listen,

I really appreciate you
helping me out with this.

So what's the plan?

All right, listen, I might
have a buyer and if I do,

I ain't gonna need you
helping me move that shit.

You know somebody who
can buy that much product?

I mean, it's not 100%,

but my boy definitely
said he was good for it.

So how long I gotta
sit on this much weight?

Well, I'm just gonna
make a run right quick

then I'll be right back.

How long you gonna be?

I mean, I'm just gonna
go talk to my other boy

about this other bag.

But you gonna find out today,

if you can move this shipment, right?

Listen, Kionna, if you can't do it,

you just gotta let me know so I
can make other arrangements.

No, I can help, I just wanna make sure

you have a game plan.

This is a lot of shit for me to hold.

But you said that you was
gonna help me get this bread,

and if you can't do it, I just
want you to let me know.

It's not that, I just wanna make sure

you're moving things right.

Whoa, so you think you are the only one

who know how to move weight?

No, that's not what I'm saying.

What exactly are you saying?

Look, I'm not trying to
fight about this, all right?

I just wanna make sure
we don't have no problems.

Well, just do this for me

and we're not gonna have a problem.

All right, fine.

All right, cool.

I'm about to leave, I'll be right back.

And let me know as soon
as you find out anything

or what's going on.

You've got to chill, I got you, relax.

(dramatic foreboding music)

(birds chirping)

Yeah, I need to talk to
somebody in narcotics unit.

All right, yo, that bitch
Kionna is in the trap house

on (indistinct) Street,

I told you I would call if
she had a large shipment.

She in the crib right now, holding on it.

She got that shit inside right now,

y'all fucking cops need to do your job

before she move all that shit.

(dramatic foreboding music)

(door thuds)

we got the warrant.

Go.

Police department, we got the warrant.

Get the girl.

(dramatic ominous music)

(indistinct chatter)

Brandon, how long until you can get me

the fuck outta here?

I'm working on that as fast as I can.

Well, you need to work
faster because I can't be in here.

I know and I'm trying
to call in every favor

I have at the DA's office.

Well, what's the hold up?

They're trying to hold you

on what they call a no bail warrant,

which means no amount of money

that you pay can get you out.

Why are they doing that?

The DA is saying that you're
running a criminal enterprise

and that you're a threat to
the community, blah, blah, blah,

all that bullshit, just
to keep you locked up.

Are you fucking serious?

I'm gonna do everything in my power

to get that no bail warrant
turned into a cash bail warrant.

Well, you gotta make it happen, Brandon,

because I can't be caged up in here.

I'll find a way to make it happen,

but it it's gonna take some time.

What kind of time?

Maybe a few days, maybe a week.

Come on, Brandon, you know,

you can make things
happen faster than that.

I'm gonna try it but I just
don't want you to get upset

if it takes more time.

Call in every favor, they owe you,

pull every string you need to.

I have to get the fuck outta here,

do you understand me?

Yes, I understand completely.

All right, make it happen.

(indistinct chatter)

Yo, what's up Brandon?

Hey Tray, listen, I just
came from out of the jail,

talking to Kionna.

Oh yeah? I heard she got locked up.

Yeah, they're holding
her on this no bail warrant.

I'm trying to get it turned
into a cash bail warrant,

but the DA, she's being a fucking cunt.

It sounds like they really
want her locked up bad.

You think you can get her cash bail?

Yeah, I think I can make it happen,

but it's probably gonna take some time

before I can get it finalized.

That's fucked up.

Yeah, it is.

Listen, Tray, I know that you two

are not seeing eye to eye right now,

but I think it would be a good idea

if you came to visit her.

I don't know why.

She said she don't need my help anymore.

Tray, she was probably just really pissed

when she said that.

(exhales sharply)

Look, she really needs
people on her corner right now.

Where her new man in all this?

Where the fuck this nigga at?

Why he ain't coming to see her?

I don't even know what his deal is.

Kionna didn't even mention
his name when I talked to her.

Maybe you should call him
and see if he'll go visit her.

(exhales sharply)

Tray, you're like a brother to her,

she really needs your support right now.

I don't know about that, Brandon.

(breathes deeply)

Look, I'm just saying consider it.

It would really help her
through this right now.

I don't know, bro.

She be acting funny already.

Maybe getting locked up

will help clear her mind a little bit.

(scoffs)
Shit, I don't know.

Look, Tray, just consider it.

(indistinct chatter)

Yo, you Kionna, right?

Yeah, how do you know me?

(scoffs)
Come on girl,

everybody know who you are.

Really?

Hell yeah, they call you
the queen of the trap house.

Who's they?

Everybody who's anybody in the streets.

(scoffs)
Man, that's probably

why I'm in here.

Too many people know who I am.

People in here know who you are too.

What's that supposed to mean?

You know Tyreke's
cousin is here too, right?

I don't even know who Tyreke's cousin is.


She damn sure know who you are.

Why you say that?

Because she talking mad shit already.

Man, what do this dumb
bitch out here saying?

She's saying, first chance she gets,

she gonna fuck you up.

I ain't worried about no bitch in here.

They say she crazy as shit, man,

you might have to handle that bitch.

What's her name?

Vena.

Vee? I ain't never even heard of her.

Hey, I'm just trying
to give you a heads up

because she's supposed to be moving

into this swing of the jail soon.

Do you really think
she's gonna be a problem?

Hell yeah and she crazy as fuck

and she talking shit.

When are they supposed
to move her at this wing?

(exhales sharply)

I don't know, but I'm sure it's soon.

Usually when they hear that they move in,

it's shortly after.

All right, well, thanks for looking out.

No problem.

Shit, I don't like the bitch, no way.

I can't wait to see
somebody fuck her ass up.


(indistinct chatter)

What's your name?

Tiona, but they call me Tee.

(indistinct chatter)

(birds chirping)

Yo, what's up, Tray?

What's going on, Jay?

I guess you heard about Kionna, right?

Yes, fucked up.

I told her not to be
holding that much weight

at one time.

Oh, but wait.

She called me and told
me she was gonna move

a large shipment and she
need me to keep the new product

separated from the rest.

Man, she knows she not
supposed to hold that much work

at the same time.

I don't know.

The fuck is she thinking?

I bet it got something to do

with the new nigga she fucking with.

That nigga trapping or something?

I don't know what the fuck he do,

but I know she ain't been acting the same

ever since this nigga came around.

That's why the fuck I had to bounce.

She act different when this
motherfucker come around,

she don't act the same,
don't talk the same, nothing.

Yeah, she different bro.

Yo, I bet this got something to do

with this motherfucker, Davon.

Who else would she be
doing something like this for?

She would've never
done no shit like this.

If I was around, I'd have
talked some sense into her.

I tried to tell her it was a bad move,

but she wasn't trying
to hear shit I was saying.

Where is this nigga, Davon?

Nobody seen him nowhere?

Nah, that motherfucker is like a ghost.

Ever since Kionna got locked up,

you can't find this motherfucker nowhere.

Yo, this nigga suspect
and a motherfucker, man.

That's what I'm saying.

This nigga sideways, bro.

I've been seeing that.

Yo, I wouldn't be
surprised if he set Ki up.

(birds chirping)

What we gonna do?

I ain't doing shit, that's
not my business anymore.

Tray, she needs your help bro.

I know she do, but
she said she don't need it.

She might got her mind fucked up,

she not thinking straight.

Look, I'm not saying I'ma help,

but if I was, first thing I'd do

is find out where that nigga Davon at.

(birds chirping)

(indistinct chatter)

So any word that they got me a cash bail?

I'm still working on it.

(breathes deeply)

Brandon, come on now.

I know you don't wanna hear me say this,

but these things take time and the DA,

that fucking bitch is really pushing back.

She has got it out for
you, I don't know what the...

It's like she has this obsession with you.

She's a fucking cunt, is what she is,

but that's neither
here nor there, that's...

We'll talk about that later.

(clears throat)

And she's really doing
everything in her power

to try to keep you in here.

She's being a fucking bitch,

I don't know why she
has it out for you so badly.

(indistinct chatter)

Well, do whatever the fuck you need to,

to get me outta here.

I will, I'm on the phone constantly

with people over there
trying to get things to happen.

Okay.

I'm working day and night

trying to make this thing happen.

Good.

There's something else I need to tell you

and I'm still trying to get
more information on it,

but I think this is a little
bit of a bigger problem.

What is it?

(exhales sharply)

I'm getting word for my
sources at the DA's office,

that this was not an investigation

that was started by them,

this came from somewhere else.

Meaning what?

Someone called this in.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Someone tipped off the police

that you were holding a
large amount of narcotics

or allegedly holding a
large amount of narcotics.

Can we find out who it was?

No, not yet,

but is there anyone that would've known

you had that much
weight on you at that time?

Someone who would've
wanted you to go down for this?

(indistinct chatter)

(exhales sharply)

(indistinct chatter)

Are you sure that's what really happened?

My sources are good.

They always give me good intel.

(indistinct chatter)

Does this help or hurt my defense?

Well, when I was referring
to this being a bigger problem,

I was actually talking about
someone within your crew

planning against you.

However, in regards to your case,

this actually might help your case.

How will it help?

If we can find anything
wrong with that search warrant,

anything at all, we can
file a motion for dismissal.

Okay, good, all right,
that's what I want to hear.

I'll have my staff at the office

going over every single
piece of that search warrant.

(exhales sharply)

Just let me know if you
find anything we can use.

Absolutely.

(exhales sharply)


(indistinct chatter)

(birds chirping)

Hello.

Let me guess, you need to talk to me

because you need me
to go (indistinct) Kionna.

Tray, Kionna is in a really
fucked up situation right now

and she needs your help
to get her out of all this shit.

Yo, everybody keeps saying that,

but y'all need to understand,

y'all need to be talking to her.

She the one who said

she don't need my help anymore.

She was just upset, okay?

She needs you now more than ever.

Man, how's she doing anyway?

I've seen her the other day,

she doing as good as she can.

gonna be able to beat the case

or she gonna have to
do some time behind this?

She said that Brandon is
working on trying to get her

out.

It's fucked up and I feel bad for her,

but Jay told me she was holding weight

she wasn't supposed to be holding.

I think this got something to do

with that nigga named Devon.

Yeah, anybody ever find out
where the fuck that nigga at?

I haven't seen or heard from him.

I tried to tell her, she
wasn't trying to hear me.

I told her something wasn't
right with that motherfucker.

She started fucking with
this nigga, Davon, and it's like,

she forgot how the game work.

Okay, and see that's why she needs you.

You would've been able to
see this shit from mile away.

Yo, this shit would've never happened

if I was around.

You need to really go see her, okay?

She would be glad to see you

and it would really lift her spirits.

That's even if she want to even see me.

She does.


Why? How do you know?

Because she asked about you already.

All right, I'll think about it.


Tray, you need to really go see her,

it will really lift her spirits up.

All right, I'll see what I can do.

(birds chirping)

It will really give her hope

if you went to go see her, man.

(indistinct chatter)

So how did it go with your lawyer today?

Did you get any good news?

(exhales sharply)

He said he may have something

to help me get the fuck
outta here or something.

So you might be getting out?

It's not definite, but
he's working on it, so.

That's good, because that bitch Vena

is still talking shit.

Yo, you really think I'm
worried about that bum ass

bitch?

I'm just saying the
bitch is fucking crazy.

I wish some stupid whole ass bitch

would press me in this motherfucker.

Hey, I'm not saying that
you can't handle your own.

Then what is you really saying?

I'm just saying, bitch is
always looking for something

to poke somebody up with.

Yeah, I appreciate the heads up

but I ain't even thinking about

these pussy ass bitches right now.

(breathes deeply)

Let me show you something.

What the fuck?

Yo, how long you been
keeping that in your mouth?


I keep it in every day.

You ever used it while you was in here?

Hell yeah, you never know.

Yo, you fucking crazy.

How the fuck is that
not cutting your mouth?


It takes practice, but it's not hard.

(indistinct chatter)

I ain't never seen no shit like that.

Well, I guess Tyreke
didn't teach you that, did he?

Nah, because I ain't even
heard nothing like that before.

Nah, I got a couple of extra
ones, so I could teach you,

you never know.

Shit.

(indistinct chatter)

(engine revs)

(paper rustling)

Wait a minute,

son of a bitch.

I think I just found the loophole.

(table thuds)



(footsteps thumping)

(indistinct chatter)

(footsteps thumping)

(engine revs)

District Attorney, Ellis.

Brandon, what can I help you with?

Did you have a chance
to review the paperwork

I sent over to your office today?

I had an opportunity to look over it.

Okay, so you would
agree that the search warrant

is no good and Kionna
needs to be let outta jail?

I believe we should
present it to the judge

to see what he says about it.

(exhales sharply)

Are you really gonna make
me go through all of that?

Kionna is a problem in this community.

Even if the search warrant is invalid,

she's still running narcotics empire.

Listen, if you can't prove
that, you can't say that.


I did prove it.

She was ascertained with
large amounts of narcotics

on her during the raid.

Yeah, but you don't have any of that

because the warrant was no good.

Brandon, we both know what she's up to,

we both know that she
orchestrated the murder of.

Tyreke

and is now running his drug operation.

Look, you can't prove

she had anything to do
with Tyreke being killed.


Just like that, she'll
be charged with murder.

Jessica, get off your high horse,

you have bigger problems
in the city than Kionna,

you know that.

Oh really?

Were you aware that she was planning

to be the biggest drug kingpin in the city?

(exhales sharply)

Can't you just drop all the charges,

so we don't have to
go in front of the judge

and we don't have to go through all that?

Oh, I see, you want me
to make your job easier

so you can let Kionna out

and she can completely take over

all illegal drug operations in the city.

You can't just do me a solid?

There is a war brewing
in the streets of this city

and it's all because of Kionna.

At least with Tyreke,

he wasn't trying to take over everything.

The streets of the city
will be stained with blood

if she gets out and has her way.

She is power hungry and
will do anything to get it.


Jessica, I think you're
being a little dramatic.


Am I?

(exhales sharply)

Just sign the damn papers.

I won't be responsible for the hell

she's going to unleash in the city.

(footsteps plodding)

(air whooshing)

(exhales sharply)

(indistinct chatter)

Hey Kionna, can you hear me?

Yeah, I can hear you.

Okay, listen, I just got
the paperwork signed

by the judge, he's gonna
be dismissing the case.

Finally, I can get the fuck outta here.

Yeah, it should just be a couple hours.

They gotta do the
paperwork at the courthouse,

they're gonna send it over to the jail,

and then I'm gonna have
somebody come pick you up, okay?

So what'd you do to
get the case dismissed?

The warrant was no good.

There were so many
discrepancies and technical issues

with that warrant.

The judge had no other
option, but to throw it out.

So he basically got the
case tossed on the technicality?

Yes, that's exactly what happened.

That's the best news
I've heard in a long time.

Okay, look, I'll catch up with you later

when you get out, once you get settled in,

we just need to go over a
couple little business issues,

some legitimate business issues.

All right, sounds good.

(indistinct chatter)

Shit, I know you happy as hell

to get up out of this place.

(scoffs)
Hell yeah.

Man, did they tell you how long it'll be

before you're released?

They just need to finish up some paperwork

and I'll be out this bitch.

I can't wait until I get
out of this motherfucker.

What they saying about your case?

I got this bullshit ass public defender,

so you know how that go.

I mean, I can't even get a
hold of this motherfucker.

Yeah, and what was
they saying about your case

the last time you talked to him?

He said I should be out in a few months,

but that's only if I don't
get into any trouble.

All right, well, just lay low,
stay off everybody's radar

and you'll be fine.

Unless a bitch tests me

because I'm gonna have
to do what I have to do, shit.

But when you do get out, hit me up,

I could use somebody like you on my team.

For real?

Yeah, for real.

Look I got big plans to expand my operation

and I'm gonna be
looking to add to my roster

if you know what I mean.

Shit, I'm definitely down with that.

I'm definitely down with that.

Well, I'm gonna definitely
take you up on that offer.

All right, cool, because I'm gonna run

this whole motherfucking
town, best believe that.

(indistinct chatter)

Hell yeah, I'm with that.

(indistinct chatter)

(air whooshing)

(birds chirping)

(car door thuds)

And I didn't think you'll
be the one to pick me up.

Yeah? I was in the area.

Why didn't come see me?


Because you was on some dumb shit.


Yeah, like you wasn't either.

I don't know what you talking about.

(scoffs)
Yeah, okay.

And I told you that nigga
Davon was a problem.

Here you go, I knew it was coming.

I'm just saying, I told you so.

All right, look, we good?

I mean...

Tray, for real.

I'm saying it though.

We good?

(exhales sharply)
Yeah. We good?

(clear throat) Yeah, we good?

All right, good.

Now, speaking of Davon,

you've seen that
motherfucker around anywhere?

Nope, he was like a fucking ghost,

vanished as soon as you got locked up.

Yeah, we need to find his bitch ass,

pay his pussy ass a visit.

I already got Jay and
Darrell on top of that.

Just give me a little more time,

we gonna find where he laying at.

All right, good.

You ready to go?

Yeah, let's go.

(birds chirping)

(engine revving)

Yo, I'm gonna run
around the corner real quick,

I'll be right back.

All right, cool.

(dramatic foreboding music)

(birds chirping)

(footsteps plodding)

Get the fuck over
here and open this door.

Come on.

Yeah.

(hinges squeaking)

Yo, how fuck did you get outta jail?

You don't sound so happy to see me,

you little snitch bitch.

Shut the fuck up.

(scoffs)
So this

was just all part of your plan?

I bet you one of them South
side niggas we didn't get to.


Nah, try again bitch.

Who the fuck are you with?

You really thought Tyreke's
people wasn't gonna come

for your ass after you had Tyreke killed?

How are you connected to Tyreke?

Tyreke is my cousin.

Oh, shit.

Yeah, oh shit.

You thought I was one of
them nice motherfuckers

that you see jogging in the park?

What the fuck do you want?

I want everything.

Everything you took for Tyreke and Denmore.

Do you think my crew
is gonna let that happen?

I don't give a fuck.

If them niggas don't fall in
line, I'm lay all them down.

You kill me, you won't
make it out of this city alive.

(scoffs)
Oh yeah? Watch this.

(hinges squeaking)

Hey, yo, Ki.

(dramatic ominous music)

Bitch ass motherfucker.

You want me to finish this
bitch ass nigga off for you?


I told you, you wouldn't
make it out of this city alive.

Hey Davon, you know what happens

when you come for the queen,

it's off with your motherfucking head.

(dramatic ominous music)

You know what?

I think it's only right

that I send this nigga straight to hell

with his pussy ass cousin, Tyreke.

Hell yeah, show this motherfucker

what happens when you fuck with the queen.

(tense sinister music)

(gunshot cracks)

(tense foreboding music)

(dramatic sinister music)
