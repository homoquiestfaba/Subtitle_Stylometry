Jackhammer!

Hi, sorry,
I'm running a little late.

I'm here for the role of brixon.

Can I have
your headshot, please?

Can I have
your headshot, please?

Yes.

Gavin, what's going on, buddy?
How you been?

It's Julius.

Oh. Yeah.
What are you doing here?

Oh, just going in for brixon.

You're auditioning for brixon?

Yeah.

My agent's been trying to get me
through these doors

for, like, two years now.

Oh, man, it's a struggle but,
hey, you're here now.

Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.

I actually just quit my job
today so I could be here.

Wow. What's with the,
uh, bowtie?

It's kind of weird.

Oh, well, it says in the script,

oh, well, it says in the script,

I'm pretty sure,
that he's wearing a bowtie.

No, man. Cuban necktie.

Yeah, well,
I didn't have a Cuban necktie

but I had a bowtie.

That's when you cut
a guy's throat

and you pull his tongue out,
through the throat.

What?

Julius Warner?

Yes?

<i>Let's get you in there, okay?</i>

What?

Members only?

<i>Damn it.</i>

<i>Damn it.</i>

Lance, I've got
Julius Warner for you.

What are you doing?

I thought we could squeeze
another one in.

Cedric, are you
a senile old piece of shit?

But I--

You were just in my office
here two minutes ago, okay?

I went over the schedule
with you.

I'm not seeing
anyone else today.

We're done.

What are you doing?

I--i just thought--

Uh-uh-uh-uh.

What are you,
a retarded fucking seal?

What am I, at seaworld?
With some fucking fish?

Do you want
some fucking mackerel?

God, almighty. The amount of
people I work with

god, almighty. The amount of
people I work with

who are so fucking amateurs.

Jesus.

Oh my god, who's this?

Uh--

<i>Are you auditioning
for the role of brixon?</i>

Yes. Yes, I am.

Oh, you are? That's nice.

I like that. You have a bowtie.

That's nice.
Is that silk or cotton?

Um, I don't know.

No one's done that yet.

Wow.

You like it?

No, I don't fucking like it.

Jesus Christ, what are you,
a chimney sweeper?

What are you, dick Van dyke,
we audition for Mary poppins?

<i>Are you gonna float away
with an umbrella?</i>

<i>Are you gonna float away
with an umbrella?</i>

Oh my god.

I got to see this.

All right, let's see bowtie man.

<i>Okay, Julius,
I want you to remember</i>

this is your audition

so you take charge
of your audition.

<i>Get on your mark</i>

and we'll go from the top
and when I call--

Well, when he calls--

Oh my god, and then,
when you breathe in oxygen,

carbon dioxide's gonna come out.

He fucking gets it, mongoloid.

Jesus Christ!

We get it!

Okay.

Okay?

So just push the button.

Push the button.

Okay.

Action asshole.

â™ª And now I'm leaving â™ª

â™ª Leaving you all behind â™ª

â™ª Leaving all of
your crooked kind â™ª

â™ª Now is my time to be free â™ª

You turn your back on me
and you're dead, Brixton.

Bang!

â™ª Every day every hour â™ª

â™ª Every day every hour â™ª

â™ª Every man must know how â™ª

Stop! Stop!

Jesus Christ, I asked you
to turn around.

Don't turn into an idiot.

I thought I did turn around.

<i>No, Einstein.</i>

In the script, you're
supposed to turn to the left.

<i>You turned to the right.
You get it?</i>

And please, please,
lose your hat,

<i>jamiroquai, all right?</i>

Action.

You turn your back on me
and you're dead, Brixton.

Bang!

Bang!

â™ª Every day every hour- â™ª

Oh my god.

<i>I am so sorry.</i>

<i>Oh my god.</i>

What the fuck!

I didn't mean to.

I just-when I turned
around the other way.

Now it's pink.

It's all pink
and it's all-it's peeling.

I am so sorry.
It was just an accident.

An accident? An accident.

Oh man, oh man,
I'll make you an accident.

Oh man, oh man,
I'll make you an accident.

<i>Let me tell you something,
you imbecile.</i>

I'm gonna make sure

that you never work
a day of theater

ever again in your life.

Not Broadway theater,
not off-Broadway theater,

<i>not regional theater.</i>

You're not gonna be able to do
dinner theater in Cleveland.

I'm gonna ruin you!

<i>Get out!</i>

<i>Get out!</i>

And jerkhead,
give me your pants.

And jerkhead,
give me your pants.

<i>Oh, yeah, you're
listening to the only station</i>

<i>that knows how to
play the goods.</i>

<i>91.1, the dog.</i>

<i>Julius, it's Laura.</i>

<i>Listen, I don't know exactly
what happened at the audition</i>

<i>but Lance selmour
called the agency personally.</i>

<i>I'm not sure how to say this.</i>

<i>I'm not sure how to say this.</i>

<i>I'm being forced
to let you go, Julius.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>There's lots of politics
in this business.</i>

<i>You're a great kid
with lots of talent.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.
I'll see you around, okay?</i>

<i>Good luck with another agent.</i>

<i>Julius, you are no longer
an employee</i>

<i>of sandwich hut.</i>

What the hell!

Kelly?

Oh. Hey, baby.

How'd the audition go?

<i>I made lasagna.</i>

You really think
I'm that stupid?

Oh, I can't think
about that right now, Julius.

Oh, I can't think
about that right now, Julius.

<i>I'm still a bit foggy
from my afternoon nap.</i>

Oh, yeah?

What?

What's this?

Oh, don't look at me like that.

How many times have I told you

that I need to continue
being creative.

Are you trying to throw this
on me, huh?

God knows how hard it has been

to put up with you
and your condition.

How many times do we have to
talk about this, Julius?

Your inability to be a real man.

Your inability to be a real man.

I told you I would never
do animal stuff again.

Push, push.

C'mon, give it to me.

Push, C'mon.

Aghhhh.

<i>Moo like a cow.</i>

Mooooo.

Oh.

Ow.

Oh, don't pretend
like you're leaving.

You have nowhere to live,
Julius.

I'll let you make it up to me.

Oh, come on.

Let's just stop
being ridiculous.

You know how your condition
makes you blow things

way out of proportion.

And you should probably
start medicating.

You should start medicating.

Whatever, loser!

I hope you nailed that audition

because you have nothing, hobo.

Go get your condition fixed,
hobo.

I have tennis elbow

I have tennis elbow

and, yeah, I did nail
that audition today.

I'm gonna be
the star of the show

so suck on them carrots.

<i>Please enjoy this ring back.</i>

<i>Please enjoy this ring back</i>

<i>while we connect your call.</i>

Hammer!

Samantha!

Help!

Samantha.

Samantha.

I'm here. Samantha.

Help me.

Samantha.

Be careful.

How did you cross
the sea of death

and the mountain of death

and the field of death
and the valley of death?

Hammer's love is more powerful

than all the world
and the universe.

Than all the world
and the universe.

You know nothing about power.

Power is in the mind.

You're all muscle, no brain.

<i>Help me!</i>

After all this is said and done

you're gonna to wish
you had a pair of these.

Hammer, be careful.

Hammer, you're so brave.

Hammer, I want you.

Samantha, my love.

Samantha, my love.

Come take me, hammer.

I will do anything
for your love.

Then kiss me right now.

Ha, ha, ha.

Uh?

Uh?

Hello?

<i>Hey, hammer, it's Julius.</i>

<i>I know it's been a while
but I just thought I'd--</i>

<i>I know it's been a while
but I just thought I'd--</i>

No, no, no, baby. It's all good.

I'm just at work,

taking a power nap
in between shows.

<i>I'm glad you called me,
it's good to hear your voice.</i>

What's going on?

What's new?

Nothing much.

Yeah?

How's you and Kelly?

She's into animals now.

Yeah, yeah, cool, cool.

What?

Yeah.

Things are kind of bad
at the moment, actually.

I was hoping that maybe
I could come and stay with you

I was hoping that maybe
I could come and stay with you

<i>just, you know,
until I get back on my feet.</i>

<i>I know that I haven't
called in over a year</i>

and you're probably busy
with your hip hop and--

No, no, no.

Anything but chicken wing,
baby, you're my younger bro.

Of course you can
come stay with the hammer.

Don't be frickin' ridoculous.

Thanks.

Yeah. Want to meet
in an hour? I moved.

You moved?

<i>What? Mom didn't tell you?</i>

Dude, I'm living
in a pimping ass pimp place.

It's pimping.

I got my own rapping
stripping dojo in the garage.

<i>I built it myself.</i>

1961 Westwood.

1961 Westwood.

<i>We meet then, yeah?</i>

Yeah. Yeah.

I'm renting it from this cougar

who fell in love with the hammer
at a strip show.

Hilarious.

It's all high end upstairs,
not really my styles,

but I'm renting it
for dirt cheap.

Okay. Okay, I'll see you
in a bit, okay.

Yeah, yeah.

Mom tell you how frickin'
thunder-ripped I am?

I'm like perma-pumped
seven days a week.

Hello?

Hello?

Jackhammer!

Jackhammer!

Come on, man, tell me.
What happened today?

Um, let's see.

I woke up early, had my cereal,
took my vitamins.

And then blew what was probably
the biggest audition of my life

with Lance selmour

who's basically
the Spielberg of theater.

Who's basically
the Spielberg of theater.

Spielberg? No, he's in movies.

Are you serious?

Yeah, no. Steven Spielberg.

"Jurassic park,"
"back to the future."

Those are movies, man.

But I'm saying,
he's the Spielberg,

like, of the theater.

So if, like Spielberg
was to work in theater,

he's be like Lance selmour.

Yeah, no, I get
what you're saying.

What I'm saying is
Spielberg only did movies.

<i>So he didn't do theater.</i>

I'm not saying he did theater.

I'm just saying that Lance--

I'm just saying that Lance--

Fine, he's the meryl streep
of theater?

Bam! See, now, you're kind of
making sense.

Oh, did I mention
before I got blacklisted

I decided to tell my boss
at the sandwich hut

<i>to take his chorizo
ciabatta bunwich</i>

and shove it up his ass.

What? You quit your job?

He wouldn't give me
the time off for the audition.

I know, I'm an idiot.

At least you got the man bags
to go for what you want.

As gay as it may be.

As gay as it may be.

Okay. Do you know what it means

to be blacklisted
by Lance selmour?

Hell, yeah.

Blue balls.

What? No, blacklisted.

It means I'll never work
in this town again.

If I even want to
sweep a theater,

I'd have to take off to L.A.

Or Boston.
I'm too broke for L.A.

I don't speak Boston.

That shit wouldn't fly
in the '80s, dude.

I hate power trippers.

I feel for you, baby.

Pass me the laptop.

I hate dudes like this, man.

I hate dudes like this, man.

Oh, schnapps, I'm getting
my heart palpitations again.

Whenever I get super mad
because I'm so thunderous lean,

my heart skips a beat.

You wouldn't understand.

What's his name? Lance selmour?

<i>Yeah, Lance selmour.</i>

<i>Well, guess
who's making headlines</i>

<i>for being caught cheating again?</i>

<i>Theater casting director,
Lance selmour.</i>

<i>Now if you haven't been</i>

<i>for the past, well, decade,</i>

<i>for the past, well, decade,</i>

<i>Lance selmour was once
a mediocre theater actor</i>

<i>who suddenly became
one of the most powerful</i>

<i>casting agents in the world
by strategically marrying</i>

<i>92-year-old Josephine guttenberg</i>

<i>in New York.</i>

<i>Last night, Lance was
pulled over at 3 A.M.</i>

<i>In his Bentley on suspicion
of drinking and driving.</i>

<i>He was arrested for possession
of several narcotics</i>

<i>and for soliciting a prostitute.</i>

<i>The legal team
for Mrs. guttenberg</i>

<i>issued a statement saying</i>

<i>she will not be filing
for divorce at this time.</i>

<i>She will not be filing
for divorce at this time.</i>

<i>But insiders say Lance will be</i>

<i>and is on the verge
of losing everything</i>

<i>if this happens again.</i>

<i>From powerful casting director
to potential jobless bum.</i>

<i>You got to keep it
in your pants, Lance.</i>

Look, Jules, maybe it's time
to grow up, huh?

Get a real job, like peeling.

What? Theater is a real job.

I got to get a hold of him
and apologize.

I can't believe this.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

What you need to do, baby,
is relax.

You're with the hammer now.
Let me take care of you.

You're with the hammer now.
Let me take care of you.

I got something
that'll do you well.

This right here, my friend,
is what they call hisca grass.

It's more potent
than Indian peyote.

I got it from an aboriginal guy

that makes one of
my latest rap tracks.

Indian of sorts.

A real native so you know
it's thunder strong.

A real native so you know
it's thunder strong.

Cool. Okay.

So how's that going,
anyway, the rapping?

Cbb, buddy.
It couldn't be better.

Like bread on butter. And ham.

I'm at the liquor store
slinging my CDs,

clocking the cheese.

Jiggidy jackhammer.

Coming with the big bees.

Oh, man.

My rounds are usually
way tighter than that.

It's not lyrically
connected right now.

So at the liquor store, yeah?

So at the liquor store, yeah?

You can make some money
doing that?

Are you kidding?

Big time, man. Big time.

People move
their feet 'cause I'm funky.

I'm funky.

I'm gonna have to
call you back, I'm sorry.

I'm funky. Yeah, ya are.

Listen, man, here's $20.

You got it, baby.

No, no, no, no.
Just shut that shit off.

Seriously.

You shut that shit off.

You hear me?

You shut that shit off.

You shut that shit off.

It's pretty competitive
out there, though.

There's a lot of looky-loos
and stuff, too.

Turf wars.

Anyway, I've just been getting

really connected
with my lyrics lately.

I just been taking it
to a whole 'nother emotion.

You know what I mean?

Has mom played
any of my tracks for you?

You wanna hear one?

Okay.

I just laid down
the crazy crazy last night.

Emotional, baby.
You're gonna love it.

Ready?

Yeah.

You're gonna love it.

<i>Oh shit.</i>

You all right?

Yeah, totally.

I'm totally fine.

I can't believe mom hasn't
played any of my tracks.

They're off the hill.

I'm totally fine.

Hang on, I've got to do
some vocals.

Buddy, baby, buddy, bonkers.

Oh, shit.
Buddy, baby, buddy, bonkers.

Protein Pete packs a powerful
potassium punch.

I think I'm ready, baby.
Unique New York.

Buddy's baby, buddy's bonkers.

Hey, little buddy.

Hey, little buddy.

Hey, little buddy.

What's happening, little buddy?

Ohhh.

<i>I mean, I've become
super successful at peelery</i>

<i>while you're still pursuing
your fairy theater stuff but,</i>

look, I'm not holding it
against you

and I'm not making fun of you.

I'm just saying.

Since you're here,
maybe we should change that.

<i>We should be like we were
when we were little kids,</i>

<i>joined at the hip.</i>

Should be like
Crockett and tubbs.

I'm obviously Crockett, though,
because he gets the ladies.

<i>Obviously.</i>

<i>Obviously.</i>

What?

I said I'll be like Crockett
because he gets the ladies.

What are you talking about?

The "Miami vice" guys?

Fine, I don't care.

Yeah, I'll be Crockett.

No, I'll be Crockett.

Look, tomorrow, we're gonna
get you a job.

Yeah, I'm introducing you
to Igor.

Your stripping agent?

No way, man.
I don't want to strip.

That's pretty fricking
ridiculous if you ask me.

But whatever, it's your choice.

Igor's got a few different jobs.

Maybe you could be a delivery
driver for his escorts.

Maybe you could be a delivery
driver for his escorts.

How's mom? Crazy as ever.

She likes living
in a trailer park.

But you know that,
you talk to her all the time.

On the phone, yeah.
I haven't seen her--

Are you gonna drink that?

I got to, uh--

Julius, this is potent protein.

Look at the tuna
cling to the egg yolk.

Jackhammer!

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Can't be bothered right now,
Mr. hammer.

I'm his most loyal client.
Let me in there.

I don't think so.

Still ain't paid for the last
eight buckets you picked up.

Not very happy with you.

This is horseshit.

I don't have time to
barter with you, bronco.

I'm feeling sick.

There's no way
I'm letting you in here

to fuck more product.

<i>No way.</i>

<i>Dammit!</i>

If I could just say,

hammer only needs to
get in there

to extrapolate some
antidioxomicro-correlobolators.

Yay.

Yay.

Or else rocko is not gonna get

his synthesizing
biceptual triceratops.

If you could
just let us in there

so we can magnetize insapiens
systorical functionality

in the membrane.

All right.

Since you put it that way,
I suppose I could let you in.

But no one gets in for the next
15 minutes, all right?

Nobody gets in, nobody,
understand that?

Let me get some protein, man.

<i>Put the hand out, chest high.</i>

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck?

<i>This is not fucking
happening, man.</i>

Jesus Christ, bronco,

what the fuck
are you doing, man?

<i>What do I pay you for anyway?
Piece of shit.</i>

<i>Hey, rocko,
I got my brother with me.</i>

How do I know he's not a cop?

<i>He's not the popo.</i>

<i>Okay, come in.</i>

Close the door,
bronco, you idiot.

Rocko, I need the purest stuff
you can right now, baby.

Rocko, I need the purest stuff
you can right now, baby.

<i>You know I'm good for it.</i>

Hammer, I sponsored you
for one strip-off tournament,

that's it.

And you didn't even
do that good.

Now you're
up to your ears in debt.

<i>Do you know, most people
owe me that much money,</i>

<i>I cut off their balls?</i>

But I know
it's how you make a living

so you're lucky.

Rocko, I got a couple of
stagettes coming up.

<i>Just hook me up some protein</i>

<i>'til I get to the dojo.</i>

I'm shaking rough.

I don't even know why
I like you, hammer.

You are looking seriously well
on polypeptides, my man.

I'm low.

Lucky for you,
I got something special.

Lucky for you,
I got something special.

One of a kind.

Was that aerobics
you were doing?

What?

No.

Do you want to
get down to business

<i>to get some protein or not?</i>

Yeah.

I bartered for this
with the maharaja

during my travels to India.

During my travels to India.

<i>Legend has it
the recipe for this bar</i>

<i>was handed down
from father to son</i>

<i>since the ancient mesopotamians.</i>

<i>Supposedly,
the alchemists of the day</i>

figured out a way
to transform gold

into pure 100% protein.

Many men have died
for the chance

to behold its golden shimmer.

And here now, today,
I'm offering this to you

on a cuff
for the low price of $320.

On a cuff
for the low price of $320.

I'll even throw in
a couple of these.

Deal.

<i>Are you sure that's still good?</i>

What's its best-before date?

So when are you gonna pay up?

Soon. Really soon.

What the fuck are you doing?

What you--
Put that back.

You're paying for all that shit.

Put 'em on my tab.

Hammer, you've got
serious problems.

If you don't come through,
I'm cutting you off.

Rocko don't get played,
I get paid.

Fuck!

<i>Close the fucking door, bronco.</i>

<i>Goddamned tinkerbell.</i>

<i>- I am agent.
Trust me.</i>

No money in acting.
Only money in strip show.

You only have one agent,
me, Igor, nobody else.

Besides, you're too skinny
and ugly for acting.

Igor Face
like Jean-Claude Van damme.

Greatest actor ever.

You not understand.
Need long dong is gone.

You better be a strip show..

You better be a strip show..

Dongy dong, you're not seriously

leaving the business,

I'm gonna miss
our tag team duos, man.

Judo jock. Karate cock.

Bff.

Balls for fans, baby.

Bff.

What's going on?

<i>I tell you one last time,</i>

They were on deposit.

<i>This is not my problem, no.</i>

No! What D'you mean?

Igor, this is my
younger brother, Julius.

<i>Speak English.</i>

<i>I am American.
I am born in America.</i>

Hi, there. This is Julius Warner

and I would like to please speak
to Lance selmour if possible.

<i>Listen, I am speaking American.</i>

Oh. Do you know when his

<i>Born in America.</i>

Okay, thank you.

<i>You don't understand

<i>Okay, listen. Listen.</i>

<i>What? No, listen.</i>

<i>Listen, I tell you again.</i>

<i>You're from America?</i>

And he's got a big dick.

How big? Huge, huge.

He look like nothing like you.

<i>- Different fathers.
Different father.</i>

Big time.

So what he do then?
He's strip show like you?

<i>- Bam, that's what.
I'm talking about.</i>

And you know you shorted me
for last week's stag.

No! No stripping for me.

So what's he do then?

I don't know.

I guess he could be
a little delivery driver

<i>for your escorts.</i>

Okay, I'll pay you $75
for every girl you pick up

<i>and drop off to date.</i>

<i>Good?</i>

<i>Good?</i>

<i>Sure, yeah, I can do that.</i>

You're starting tomorrow, yes?

Yes.

<i>and the money's in the drawer.</i>

Why don't you just pay me?

Yeah, yeah, don't worry. What's

<i>Julius.</i>

Okay, so you tell Julius

<i>sometimes these bitches

<i>These girls

he is never safe.

Watch out. Go, tell him, go!

He wanted me to tell you

that these escorts
are not like real humans.

Yeah, I know.

Yeah, I know.

<i>They're dangerous, these--</i>

I got it.

So are you gonna pay me?

Soon, real soon.

Hold on.

Then I get laid, in the shade.

I'm all about the spray fade,
hammer's on a crusade.

The same Samantha

<i>The stewardess?
Didn't you used to like her?</i>

<i>The stewardess?
Didn't you used to like her?</i>

What? No.

You know the hammer
don't do relationships.

I don't like anybody, ever.

You happy?

I'm proud of you, Jules.

You might even get laid tonight.

And more important,

are my hammies looking
chisel-ripped?

Why do you care?
We're going to a party.

You don't know when
your pants coming off.

That's the mystery of life.

That's the mystery of life.

So?

Yeah, no, they look fine.

Don't lie to me, tubbs.

It's obvious
I need more self-Tanner

to bring out the cuts.

Here, put some on.

I can't get all up in there.

No.

Don't be a gay and do it.

Do it!

Get up, two hands.

Marinade those bad boys.

Jackhammer!

Whose party is this anyway, man?

This party's a friend of mine,
Jason harinals.

Ah, you know a dude named
Jason hairy balls?

No, I said Jason harinals.

It's what I said, hairy balls.

There he is. Jason.

Samantha, you look amazing.
Thanks for coming.

Care to see my abs?

Ooh, have you been working out?

No, all natural.

<i>Oh, right.</i>

<i>Not gonna get some schnooky?</i>

Oh, yeah.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow it down.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow it down.

You the one they call

<i>â™ª It's unclean â™ª</i>

Want a jackhammer poster?

No. Bam.

See, I'm telling you, baby.

All you need to do

is get into doing some peeling
with the hammer.

You make more in one night
than you do the whole week

driving those crazy broads
around in a dumb limo.

Give your head a shake,
one plus one equals two.

Give your head a shake,
one plus one equals two.

This is true.

What's up?

<i>See, pretty pants,
you never listen to me, man.</i>

I know. You'll have enough money

to pack up and be in Boston

before your casting season
even starts.

Hey, you like Russian sausage?

<i>Get away from me,
you're disgusting.</i>

Hey, you have a nice ass.

You want job in strip show?

Where did Samantha go?

Hey, you want
a jackhammer poster.

Why would I want your poster?

Jackhammer, baby,
award-winning peeler.

Bam.

Eugh, I don't watch peelers.

Good. Move it along then.

Good. Move it along then.

There's a line-up.

<i>Yeah, baby, you made it.</i>

Come here.

Oh yeah.

With Frederick fruitcake.

This place is tight.

Who owns it?

Anyway, man, this is tubbies,
I was telling you about.

<i>What are you drinking?</i>

A passion--

Ladies, meet hammer.

Hi, hammer.

What's up, ladies.

I discovered hammer in '04.

His show at the rub 'n stub,

mesmerizing.

Hmm, it is pretty good.

Yeah, now go hit the tanning.

Yeah, now go hit the tanning.

Anyway, man, I'm telling you.

Jules won't listen to me, man.

If he wants to make
the real decent dollars,

he's got to christen
those living room doors, man.

He won't listen to me.

There is absolutely no way you'd
make it

as a peeler right now, chump,
let me tell you that.

But I could work with this.

You could train him, though,
baby.

You need to strengthen
your core.

Neuroflexin.
Work on your reflexes.

Hopscotch. Endurance.

Thighmaster. Bicycling.

That monkey thing.

One-armed push-ups.

Hammy stretchers.

Calisthenics and thrusting.

Those lines that you run
at the gym.

<i>Plyometrics.</i> Chin-ups.

Bowflexing. Gorilla push-ups.

<i>- Tug-o-war.
Lubin' up.</i>

<i>- Tug-o-war.
Lubin' up.</i>

<i>- Cardiovascular.
Elastics.</i>

We'll have you lady-ready
in no time.

Bam.

You should do this.
I already told hammer--

Jules.

Frederick reigned the world

peeling stage
for six years, man.

I wouldn't let him train me
if he wasn't the best.

This is a huge opportunity
for you, man.

Do it. Do it.

Do it. Do it. Do it.

Absolutely.

Saskatchewan peel-off champion
'94 to '97.

There's no way
that I'm stripping.

I just-i can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.

Look, Rick.

I've had some material issues
growing up too.

I've had some material issues
growing up too.

Forget about your mother.

But then I tried on
that first thong

and it fit like a glove.

My life has never been
the same since.

Think about that.

You'll come around.

Cannonball.

Please come here, come here.

Come here.

Just curious, baby.
You know what these are?

Phone numbers.

For women.

They give 'em to me

because they know
that peelers bought the cheese.

God, you're relentless.
Okay, fine.

How much do you guys
actually make?

400 bones, baby. One dance.

You don't go full nude.

Tie-offs, pull some g-strings,
do your little routine.

Bam, that's it.

Handful of dollars,
handful of numbers.

This is ridiculous.
What's tie-off?

This is ridiculous.
What's tie-off?

You don't know?

Julius, drink. Come on.

Wanna know?

<i>- Not really.</i>
Do you want some?

Look, you do what you gotta do

to get yourself a chubby,
all right? A big one.

You know what that is, right?
Hm.

Then, you take an elastic band
so it's nice and tight,

you fold it in two
and then you release it

around the base
of your pajang jang.

Bam. It's hard while you do
your whole routine.

It's beautiful.
Hurts a little bit.

Got to just go use the washroom
before I do a show.

I got my elastics,
I got my porn mags,

I got my elastics,
I got my porn mags,

or I use images
from my huge library of memories

because I got lots of 'em.

400 bucks, one dance?

That's what I'm
talking about, baby. Yeah.

I wouldn't even know what to do.

When the pupil is ready,
the teacher shall appear.

I'll be your Swayze,
you be my baby.

No, no, baby,
you ain't thinking about it.

You're doing it,
you're doing it now.

Caboose, caboose,
caboose, caboose.

Fine, I'll do it.

Yeah, baby, put it right here.

Bam. That's what
I'm talking about.

Whoa, yeah.

Hey, aren't you friends
with that Russian dude?

Why?

<i>'Cause he's
in the gardener's house</i>

messing with the wrong chick.

He's gonna get his ass beat.

I knew it, we can't
take that guy anywhere.

Ha, ha, ha, ha.

Dammit. Stupid Russians.

<i>Aghh, aghhh.</i>

I am not a ballerina.
I am not a ballerina.

Igor's getting beat by a girl.

Oh my god, that's crazy Lucy.

Oh my god, that's crazy Lucy.

Just save him. Trust me.

Who?

My back-up is here.

So, you're his back-up, huh?

What? Hell, no.

<i>Hammer don't do back-up.</i>

We're not back-up.
We're backing up.

Who we got here?
We got Mario, Luigi

Oh, look at me, I'm latina.

She is my shining star.

She is my morning glory.
She is my shining star.

She is my sexual genie

and I will fuck you up,

I know what your problem is.
You're a rag monster.

You wish you had

and you don't.

Is that my problem?

Is that--
Oh, is that my problem?

<i>I didn't know
that was my problem.</i>

No, that was What? What?

Thank you

<i>What the hell

<i>Bam, dam.</i>

Todsies, man,

I've been hitting up
your digits all day long,

like a crazy stalker.

Come on, hammer,

you know how unreliable
my cell phone battery is.

Hey, Julius.

Hey, Julius.

I hear you're
gonna be joining us.

Congratulations, kid.

Oh, hey, Max glutes.Thanks.

Well, what do you mean,
for what?

Todsies, guess what?

I got you in the 6-man
bubble bath, baby.

Thank me later.

Protein shots on the house.

Protein shots.
Extra polypeptides.

The 6-man what?
What are you guys--

Are you kidding me?

Baby, the annual
6-man bubble bath show, man.

It's huge.

It's, like, the opportunity
of the year.

Tonight? No, hammer, I can't.

I'm in a lot of pain right now.

I'm in a lot of pain right now.

And I almost had an old lady
die on me today.

I have old ladies
die on me all the time.

It's, like,
part of the job, baby.

Look, you're never
gonna be a PRO peeler

if you let little things
like that get in the way.

I don't want to be
a professional peeler, hammer.

I'm just doing this
so I can make enough money

to get out of this town
and pursue my career.

Okay, dubblies, I'm gonna
come clear, all right?

Me and some of the boys
are suspecting that Tony,

he's got fungus infection, man.

He's been itching
and scratching all day.

He's been itching
and scratching all day.

Come on, man, you can't let me
get into a warm bubble bath

with fungus-foot Tony.

Help me out, man.

Hey, hammer.
Is he ready for wardrobe?

Fine, hammer.

If you need me, I'll do it.

Bam, that's what
I'm talking about.

Hey, Tony, ha, ha, ha,
you're out.

I ain't got no fungal foot.

<i>Beat it.</i>

Time's up, hammer.

Rocko seriously needs his money.

Rocko seriously needs his money.

Bronco, what's up, baby?

It's not exactly the best time.

But if we had time
to be septualizing--

I don't think so.

First time, not nice.

Second time, got me twice.

It's time you pay the Piper.

I'm gonna send your shipments--

Whoa, whoa, whoa, bronco.

No reason to start getting
all crazy, all right?

<i>Nobody's gonna get
hammer's shipment.</i>

How much do I still
owe you guys?

Let me see, paid half so $2500.

You spent $5000 on protein?

â™ª Sometimes you got to invest â™ª

â™ª If you wanna be the best â™ª

â™ª If you wanna be the best â™ª

â™ª Coming from

â™ª I'm tired of using-- â™ª
Hang on a sec.

Where did you get
the $2,500 from?

I thought you were in between--

Yeah, I know, I know.

I borrowed it from you
from underneath the bed.

What?

It's all good, baby.

I'll make it you back.

Hammer, bubble-bubbles,
bubble-bubbles.

All right, listen, we're gonna
do the bubble bath show.

We're gonna cop
some serious cheese, all right?

I'll get you tonight. Cool?

All right.

Okay, well, why don't you just
take everything I've got then?

Okay, well, why don't you just
take everything I've got then?

Here, here's my last $100
in tips.

Yeah?

Bam, that's what
I'm talking about.

$100 right here, baby.

Pow! That makes it $2,400.

Tonight.

<i>Three minutes to show time,
everyone,</i>

<i>three minutes to show time.</i>

All right, baby, let's get
your money back, all right?

We're gonna do the bubble bath

and then I'm gonna go see Igor
about my next booking.

<i>Bubble-bubble, baby,
bubble-bubbles.</i>

This is why I stopped
returning your calls

in the first place.

You get me involved
in crazy scenarios

and then I'm always the one

that ends up having to pay
for your mistakes.

What's wrong with you, baby?
Tonight's deadly night.

What's wrong with you, baby?
Tonight's deadly night.

We're gonna make
some crazy money.

Bubble-bubbles, baby,
bubble-bubbles.

No, no.
Tonight's a horrible night.

Tonight's the night
that I realize

that I've been stupid to think
that you'd changed.

Why the hell am I always
listening to you anyway?

It's 'cause I'm the hammer

and you're always up to stupid
gay shit, that's why.

Oh yeah? Like listening to you
about stripping?

Oh, you don't want to
go there, little brother.

I'm an award-winning peeler.

Plus stripping
is a respectable profession.

Plus stripping
is a respectable profession.

It's tough for a lot of peelers
<i>make it through college, man.</i>

What?

You wouldn't know
about a college

if it landed
in your protein shake.

I'm making
my own rap album, dude.

It's like a school of rapping.
It's the exact same thing.

Rapping and stripping?

Why don't you grow up?

You're 32 years old.

Why don't you turn straight?
You're 27.

That fairy theater shit
is embarrassing.

You're bringing down the whole
family name, you know that.

We don't even have
the same last name.

You don't make any sense.

You don't make any sense.

You know what?

You know what?

You and I are nothing alike.

You're gonna die alone
with your tied-off hard-on

because you only care
about yourself.

Oh, I only care about myself?

Who was stuck at home

babysitting your pansy ass
for three years

while my friends
were having glorious times?

Riddle me that, baby,
riddle me that.

That's what big brothers do
when their parents are at work.

What is with you
and not letting things go.

That was, like, 15 years ago.

That was three years
I lost in the '80s, man.

That's like 10 years
in today's time.

<i>Plus, I'm not the one
who left mom</i>

<i>plus, I'm not the one
who left mom</i>

to go live with a yuppie.

Walter was my dad.

There you go,
doing that gay shit again.

See, I don't speak the language

of the land of the fairies.

I knew I couldn't
count on you for nothin'.

This was a huge mistake.

I actually thought
that you were helping me.

<i>Forget it.</i>

I'd rather live in my Van
than be close to you.

I think he's adopted.

No, that was really stupid,
hammer.

I can't believe you took
that money without even asking.

What were you thinking?

What were you thinking?

Hammer! Snap out of it.

<i>It's cool time.</i>

<i>Where's my show?</i>

You have to be
at the regent hotel

in one hour.

At 3:15. Okay

they request you do genie show.

What?

No, I hate the genie show.

Igor, we talked about this, man.

You said, "no more genie show."

That's it, I'm not doing it.

<i>No genie show.</i>

You do this.

I'm not doing it.
<i>- You do this.</i>

No, I'm not doing it.
<i>- You do this.</i>

No, I'm not doing it.

You do this.

Dammit.

<i>Sound like good time to me.</i>

<i>Sound like good time to me.</i>

Maybe you'll crash
some pussy too, huh?

<i>I'm so not into this
tonight, man.</i>

I'm stressing out.
I've been traumatized.

Plus, I hate
the genie show, man.

I look like a fruity
carpet-flying wizard.

I'm not gonna be able to
get it up tonight.

Look, I'm not tying off.

Killer, best deal laptop.

Yes, I have this one.
Give me credit card.

<i>No, give me credit card now.</i>

$300.

I throw in plastic spatula.

This is best deal.

This is best deal.

You no get better deal
anywhere else.

Okay, fine, go fuck yourself.

<i>You call me
and then you want laptop.</i>

<i>Look at this thing, man.</i>

<i>Stupid.</i>

<i>The ladies don't think
it's sexy.</i>

They'll laugh at me, man.

Come on, Igor.

<i>Let me wear the silk pants.</i>

Come on, silk pants?

Don't make me wear
this stupid teacup thing.

Okay, you wear silk pants.

But no underwear.

Deal.

I have fixed problem for you.

Russian underground
erection pill.

Russian underground
erection pill.

My cousin, he make it.
He want to be chemist.

You take this,
you have no problem.

Look, I'm just taking
what I need, all right?

I'm leaving my bag here.

How long do they take
to kick in?

Oh, you're good. No worry.

Igor, what the hell was in
those pills you gave me, man?

My cock is so hard it hurts.

I can't go to the lobby
with this thing

I can't go to the lobby
with this thing

because it's pulsating.

I don't know what's in them,
I never try it.

What do you mean,
you haven't tried them?

I told you, my cousin make them.

I don't trust him. He's idiot.

You told me he's a chemist.

I said he wants to be chemist.

What?
Put it up in your waistband.

Don't you think I've tried
the waistband trick?

You're going down, ruskie. I'm--

Hello?

Dammit.

Oh, shit.

Fucking watch
your fucking shit, Aladdin.

Fucking watch

Yeah.

That's Lance selmour,

Jules.

No.

Hey, buddy, psst, hey.
You wanna make $100?

Sure.

Okay, come here.

Look, all I need you to do
is keep six for hotel staff,

cops or management.

I'm just gonna take
my camera right here

and I'm just gonna get
some footage

that window right there. Cool?

Why?

Why?

Don't worry about it,
man. It's no big deal.

You wanna make $100?

Ohh! What the hell?

Shit. You some kind of pervert?

Dammit.

Oh, shit, no thanks, man,
not interested.

No, it's not what it looks like.

Buddy, relax, okay? Shh, shh.

Look, I'm not
some kind of a pervert

or something, all right?

All right, all right,
all right, buddy.

Come here, come here.

I'll tell you the truth,
all right?

Look, man, I'm a male stripper

going through some issues, okay?

I had to do this show
tonight, man.

I'm taking these underground
Russian erection pills

from this chemist
or thought he was a chemist

from this chemist
or thought he was a chemist

but he's just really--
Oh, don't worry about it, man.

Here's $100.
C'mon, let's do this.

Not for a measly $100.

I got way more money
coming down the pike, man.

What? What is that?

A vision board.
Law of attraction, man.

You're kidding me.
You're a bum, dude.

You don't want $100?

Freakin' perverts.

Dammit.

Freakin' bums.

Freakin' bums.

<i>Oh, I got stuff to
tenderize your meat, baby.</i>

Oh, ahh, ahhhh.

Ahhhh.

<i>I'm a vegetable.</i>

<i>I'm a rutabaga.</i>

Jackhammer!

<i>Why you walking funny?</i>

What do you think
I'm walking funny for, ruskie?

Look at that, man.
What are the freaking chances?

Look at that, man.
What are the freaking chances?

Ooh, I like. I think I know her.

Not the ho.

The guy.

That's that casting director guy
that blue-balled Julius.

He's married, remember,

I just caught him at the hotel

with this prostitute.

Igor, you're not
getting it, man.

With this, I can get Julius

another shot
at that audition, man.

You're an idiot.
Why do you even give shit?

I give a shit because I've been

a shitty brother my whole life.

I never supported Julius
in anything, man.

Nothing,
and I just messed up bad.

I'm gonna put
my rap album on hold

so I can finally be
the brother I know I should be

and let Julius
go after his dream.

You know what I mean?

Have you been listening
to anything I said?

Yes, I said you were idiot.

Are you crying?

What? No.

You're an emotional pussy.

You selfish sponge cake,
cry me a river.

<i>What?</i>

You love bubble baths
and pink daiquiris.

What?

What? I ask you what.

I said I'm doing it for Julius.

I don't care what it takes.

Oh, hello, Mr. hammer.

<i>Nee how,</i> sue sue.

Is Frederick free?

Ooh, he and mito
are training on patio.

Ooh, he and mito
are training on patio.

It's important.

Ooh, I don't know.

Please.

I don't know.

Please.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Follow me.

<i>Mr. hammer.</i>

Mr. hammer!

Hey, Freddie.

Hey, hammer. I got your message.

I was gonna call you when
I wasn't so busy working out.

Look, I know you're training
for the worlds and everything.

I'm just--

It's okay, gorgeous.

Oh, baby, you look stressed.

Meet me in the tub.

I could use a tub.

Make me and hammer

make me and hammer

two extra-strength protein
shakes on the double.

I said extra-strength.

Hmmm.

What's the matter?

When I first scouted you,
I knew, like,

two seconds you had
world championship potential.

I'm not gonna
risk my investment.

I'm not gonna
risk my investment.

Freddie, I can't do this
without you, man.

Ladies, go play.

I need to talk to hammer alone.

And before we get into
all the details,

have you actually
thought this thing through?

Yeah.

I mean, do you realize
you can go to jail for this

for a very long time

and miss the world championship
of peeling?

Not to mention
you're on the verge of

having your music heard
and maybe a record deal?

You know what?

I don't care about any of
that stuff right now, Freddie.

All I care about is just
making it up to Julius.

Lance selmour
is a high-profile douche

but he's no pushover.

You're way over your head,
hammer.

I beg to difference.

I beg to difference.

With this footage,
he's gonna poop his pants.

All we gotta do is get past
the security at the Manhattan

and, boom, we're in, baby.

C'mon, man, are you with me?

You're putting your life
on the line, hammer.

I'm putting my life on the line?

Okay, I'll do it.

But on three conditions.

One, we do this
like a tag team strip show.

Yeah.

Matching accessories,
matching outfits.

And two, you take the lead
for once, okay?

And we put the pressure on him
the whole time.

And we put the pressure on him
the whole time.

And three,
if everything goes well,

you need to train for the real
championship of peeling.

Bam.

That's what I'm talking about.

I'm gonna cry, baby.

Thank you.

God delivered me a gift
when he brought me you.

<i>How are ye going?</i>

Welcome to the parkside.

We're here
to Jimmy the lift, oy.

Sorry? C'mon, mate.

Skedaddle.

Skedaddle.
Skedaddly-do, get out of here.

Okay, I don't even know
what that means.

And there's nothing on the list
about repairs.

And there's nothing on the list
about repairs.

Look, mate,
you've got a 2-ton lift

that's
<i>dallywaggin' the dongadin.</i>

Right now.

Is that on your list, oy?
That on your list, oy?

Yes, is that on your list?

Tell him, ,
no time for a chinwag, eh?

Straight away, then,
get your wriggle on.

I don't even know
what the hell--

<i>On with it, on with it.</i>

Listen, mate,
you're always doing this.

<i>From now on, I'm talking
to the blokes in charge.</i>

<i>What a flat out waste of.</i>

<i>â™ª I took my shovel out â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª dug myself a shallow grave â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª dug myself a shallow grave â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª offered up my soul to god â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª and waited for it
to be saved â™ª</i>

What's up?

Listen, I know
we're not on the list

but we did get a call
from the head office.

And I am so tired right now.

All I want to do is go home,
get out of these clothes

and take a nice hot,
soapy shower.

Ah, sure.

Ah, sure.

They mess up on these lists
all the time, anyways.

Rico, suave, get to work.

Oh, yes, sorry, guys.
Go ahead, go ahead.

I can give you my number now
if you like.

Yeah, you can give me
your number.

I'll call you.

Ready to do this? Let's do this.

<i>Woo,</i>

what the hell?

<i>Ooh, shit.
I knew this was coming.</i>

Sorry, honey,
but we're going up.

Oh, me too.

Frederick?

No, guadelupa.

No, guadelupa.

Oh, no.

You're Frederick.

Saskatchewan peel-off champion
'94 through '97.

Busted.

Ohh.

Okay, busted, busted.
Isn't this your floor?

No, no. This is your floor.

No, come on, I don't want to go.

Listen, the elevator's
going up and you're gonna--

Hey, I'm a peeler too.

Frederick, I know that's you.

I know it's you.
What's your number?

You said you'd call me,
goddammit.

Groupies.

Wasn't that--

Awkward? Yeah.

Awkward? Yeah.

That's right.

Coming to you on a wide lens,
that's right.

Is he black? I don't know.

He looked white but, damn,
he's black down below.

He looked white but, damn,
he's black down below.

Kunta kinte.

What?

<i>Housekeeping.</i>

Go away.

<i>Housekeeping.</i>

What's up, Anna Nicole?

Ha, ha, ha!

How'd you like that, huh?

How'd you like that?

How'd you like that?

How'd you like that?

Yes.

What the hell's going on?

Who are you?

Don't worry about who we are.

We know who we are.
It's about who you are.

Power trippin' douche bag.

Yeah, power trippin' douche bag.

Get the fuck out of my suite.

I'm gonna call security.

Ha, ha, I don't think so, baby.

Hell, no.

See, you're the guy
that's getting my kind,

see, you're the guy
that's getting my kind,

Julius Warner,
another shot at that audition.

Kilby? What up?

Pass him exhibit a.

Whoa!

What's up, now.

See on or about
the 18th day of July

at approximately 11:0--

5.

You, Mr. Lance selmour,

were engaged in
some weird ass shit.

Weird ass shit.

And it about to change
your life as you know it.

As you know it, son.

Yeah.

So you're screwed
right now, baby.

Did you film this?

Yeah.

On this camera?

On this camera?

That's the one.

Is this your only copy?

You better believe it.

Oh, you two jackasses.

I'm serious, are you for real?

Do you even know
how to tie your own shoes?

Jesus Christ, Shrek
and fucking super Mario.

Jesus Christ, Shrek
and fucking super Mario.

Jack black's fatter brother
and the fucking situation's

more steroided upped brother.

No, wait, no. No.

Fucking the before
and after pictures

of fit for life.

Is that really your only copy?

I didn't have two cameras.

Okay, well, that's enough
entertainment for one day.

Please, get the fuck
out of my suite.

<i>- Hey.</i>
What?

<i>Get out!</i>

Oh!

Come here.

I guess it's time for plan b.

You want to abort him?

No, not that plan b.
Like a back-up plan.

You do have
a back-up plan, right?

No, we don't.

I know, look, all we gotta do

is get some incriminating photos
of him with some prostitute.

I'm just gonna call Igor,

get him to bring one of
his sleazy sluts down here.

I'll do it.

What?

Freddie, you know we could
have just called a girl, man.

Freddie, you know we could
have just called a girl, man.

<i>There's no time, hammer.</i>

Eugh!

<i>Oh, yeah, man.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah, touch me.
Touch those boobs, yeah.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah. Spank me.</i>

<i>Spank me, baby.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>

<i>You like that, baby? Oh, yeah.</i>

<i>Thanks for putting me
in one of your movies, Lance.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Wake him up. Wake.</i>

<i>Hey!</i>

<i>How'd you like that?</i>

<i>D'you like that smell?</i>

Hey, exhibit b, baby.

What's up now?

<i>Your wife gonna see that, baby.</i>

<i>And what you gonna do then?
You gonna be broke as a joke.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

Oh god. Is this your only copy?

Oh no, you don't.

Okay.

Okay, okay,
all right, all right.

For god's sake,
please, Jesus Christ,

don't show that to anyone.

Okay, what do you want?

What do I want?

I want you to take my client,
Julius Warner, to the top,

'til it just don't drop.

<i>I tick tock, I'm playing--</i>

Okay, all right, fine--
<i>Chicken pox.</i>

I got it. <i>With the locks.</i>

I got it, I got it!
I got it, okay?

My rhyme's usually
way tighter than that.

Okay, all right, fine.

Just have this Julius Warner
meet me in New York

on Monday morning.

I'll give him the lead
in something,

I don't know, anything.

I know people. I'll make calls.

Deal a involved you
and some sleazy prostitute.

No big deal.

No big deal.

But deal b involves
you and guadelupa.

<i>It's whole 'nother level.</i>

<i>Dudey-whore level.</i>

Fuck! Okay, all right.

All right.

Meet me at the back lots
tomorrow.

My assistant
will give you $50,000

for whatever charity
you want, all right?

We clear?

Bam. That's what
I'm talking about.

Jackhammer!

Cookies?

Oh, shit.

Who were those guys
at the party?

I want to know.

I still can't wash
the smell of Russian

out of my girlfriend's hair.

Who were they?

Jesus, lady,
I'm just the gardener.

Just the gardener.

Hell, no, I understand.

Well, why don't I harvest
these nuts?

Agh, wait.

Agh, wait.

I got a number for someone else.

He'll be there tomorrow.

All right. There you go.

I'll get a pen.

<i>What do you want, hammer?</i>

Juleses, I'm so glad
you answered.

Look, I made it up to you.

I did something for you
to make it all okay.

I don't need your help, hammer.

I'm doing perfectly fine
on my own.

I got you another audition
with Lance selmour.

What? When?

<i>Meet us at Igor's office
in 30 minutes.</i>

Okay, well, I'm just in the
middle of luncheon right now.

Look, man, I see things
totally differently now.

Look, man, I see things
totally differently now.

We're cut from the same cloth,
we're like brothers.

I mean, we are brothers.
Crockett and tubbs, baby.

<i>Julius, you have to--</i>

<i>Lance giving Jules
the audition in New York,</i>

it's great stuff.

But the money part,
it's really, really wrong.

You can't accept it.
It changes everything.

<i>He doesn't care.</i>

We didn't ask for the money.

He wants to donate it.

You taking that money tomorrow

raises the stakes by tenfold.

I'm really going to New York?

Take the money.

The money is good part of deal.

The money is good part of deal.

We all get cash
for being involved

and everyone's happy.

Are you sure we're not gonna
go to jail for this?

There's no way that he's gonna
set us up to go to jail,

right, hammer?

You know I'm getting
pissed off here, right?

I mean, we are all
deep involved.

It's good for everybody.

Igor, it's not about you.

It's not about me.
It's about Julius.

So just stop, drop, and roll it.

All right?

Hammer?

There's no chance of
Mr. selmour setting us up

to go to jail, right?

I know what happens
to guys like me in the clink.

I know what happens
to guys like me in the clink.

What if he does set you up?

This was not part
of the plan, you guys.

I give up. I'm leaving.

What? Where are you going?

So...

You guys are being stupid
in there, hammer.

This was supposed to be
about you making it up to Jules

and not about that money.

Samantha, this money's
gonna help Julius

get set up in New York.

It's a no-brainer.

You don't need that dirty money

you don't need that dirty money

and you know that, hammer.

For a minute, I thought that
you were actually growing up.

But listening to this...

You know what? Forget it.

I got to go. I have a date.

What? With who?

Samantha! With who?

With the doorman.

From Lance's building?

Yeah. Gross.

That guy's face
looks like a horse.

You got to be kidding me.

Come on, Samantha,
you're way better than that.

You're hanging out
with peelers now.

That's another thing, hammer.
You insult everyone I date.

That's another thing, hammer.
You insult everyone I date.

Why do you do that?

Do you ever hear me
saying anything

about the little hoochies
you date?

What are you talking about?
You're jealous.

And it's so obvious
that you care for me

more than a friend.

But you don't have the balls
to say anything.

It's pathetic, hammer.
You're an emotional dwarf.

Okay, whoa, slow it down, okay?

Maybe he doesn't look
like a horse, that much.

First of all, you know
that hammer's not supposed to

do relationships
in my line of work.

People get hurt.

People get hurt.

Maybe it's hard for me
to express my emotionalities.

Maybe, yeah, the hammer's
had some feelings.

Save it, hammer. It's too late.

Whatever we have here,
it's over, hammer.

It's over.

Yeah?

Well, good, 'cause
I don't give a shit.

And he does look like a horse.

And so do you.

You guys could be
the horse couple big time.

Boy, I don't care.

You hear me? It's over.

You hear me? It's over.

It's over. You hear me?

Don't ever call me again.

Over. It's over.

So what are we gonna do now?

And why did Igor kick me
out of his office like that?

He's got some serious
temper issues.

He's got some serious
temper issues.

We're gonna
pack up our stuff tonight.

And tomorrow
after we meet Lance selmour,

we're driving to New York.

I got nothing holding me
back here now, man.

Nothing.

Okay.

And we'll start fresh
in New York.

It'll be good for both of us,
a new beginning.

Hammer, what's wrong
with your 'stache?

What?

Ah, dammit.

Crap!

Is that a fake moustache?

Yeah, this 'stache is fake.

Yeah, this 'stache is fake.

I'm a fake.

Why?

Why?

'Cause I can't freakin' grow
a proper one, that's why.

I have a condition
called moustacheopecia.

Patchy irregular hair growth.

Look.

Okay, that's enough.

I'm so ashamed, man.

I'm sorry I let you down,
little brother.

I'm sorry I let you down,
little brother.

What are you
talking about, hammer?

I don't care
about your moustache.

I don't know why you do.

I don't know.

I guess, if you
want to get technically

psychologically about it,
all my heroes growing up, man,

they had lush thick 'staches.

They were ladies' men.

Men's men.

I guess I always thought
in order to be a real stud,

I needed to look just like 'em.

I needed to look just like 'em.

I can't.

'Cause I'm a fraud, man.

A fake.

I ain't jackhammer, man.

I'm hammer vanilli.

Really?

C'mon, that's silly.
Name a couple.

What, are you kidding me, man?

Tom Selleck,

Charles Bronson,

Ron Jeremy, Freddie Mercury,

Mike ditka, Geraldo,

Lanny McDonald,

Alex trebek,

Alex trebek,

captain Morgan,

captain crunch.

Okay, okay, I get your point.

Cap'n crunch was always
my favorite too.

Yeah?

I'm gonna go pack.

What?

<i>- Rocko, it's hammer.
I need to swing by.</i>

I need to stock up.

I'll need 'em for
the big apples tomorrow.

The emporium's closed, hammer.

Rocko, I'm down
on my last protein bar.

I'm serious.

I wouldn't lie to you
about this.

I don't want to be the one

to have to tell you this,
hammer.

But you've got a real problem.

<i>You need to look
at yourself in the mirror.</i>

I do that all the time.

You're not listening to me.

I'm gonna have to cut you off.

I'm gonna have to cut you off.

There's a 10-step program
you can take.

It starts with an all-carb diet.

What?

I'm sorry. Good luck, hammer.

<i>â™ª Loneliness is feeling â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª don't let me down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I will just feel this way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª but it's taking hold of me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª but it's taking hold of me â™ª</i>

â™ª baby why'd you make me cry? â™ª

<i>â™ª I try and I try to deny that
this thing wasn't serious â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Girl you really</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Why'd you have to walk away? â™ª</i>

What are you doing down there?

<i>- God. Geez, help.</i>
Julius.

<i>- God. Geez, help.</i>
Julius.

Julius.

What are you doing down there?

You're interrupting my moments.

<i>Help, help. Help, hammer.</i>

<i>They got me.</i>

Igor.

What the hell you doing, man?

What the hell you doing, man?

You know what I do.

You got greedy with money
and tried screwing me.

Not very American of you.

Look, you're not being
very '80s right now.

Don't make me kick
some kung-fu ass up in here.

Okay, stop. Let Julius go.

So I have deal for you.

I take my share of the money,
we split 50-50.

Sound good?

No, don't sound good

'cause hammer
don't do deals, usually.

This is how deal go down.

Tomorrow, you and Julius,

you meet Lance selmour
like planned.

And I follow you
in different car,

make sure you're not
set up by police.

Make sure you're not
set up by police.

Then you drive away
with the money.

I make sure
you are not followed.

Then you meet me
inside this address.

You give me money.

I release you
from stripping contract.

Then you go New York.
We both happy.

No trap.

That's my last protein bar, man.

Well, I forgot my lunch.

Don't do it.

I do this. Do not do it.

I do this. Don't do it.

I do this. Don't do it.

I do this. Do not take
my last protein bar.

I do this. Do not take
my last protein bar.

I do this.

Dammit.

Damn, I hate Russians.

You okay? Come here.

We're still set.

Come on.

Seven, eight, nine and release.

I'm glad you're okay, tubbses.

He got me right in the elbow.

Oh, don't be such a wuss-puss.

I've got tennis elbow.

So what are we gonna do?

You think we could get away
without giving him the money?

No, not Igor, man.

He's been acting like
a huge homosensual lately.

He's backdooring everybody.

It's not worth it, man.

We'll just start fresh
in New York.

We got to go get some haircuts
to help me think.

Okay.

Okay.

<i>Please hold on the line.</i>

Trying to track someone down

and I got to listen
to this crap?

Who is it, and what do you want?

I tell you what I want.

I want that slimy ruskie

<i>who snuck into
your swank-ass party.</i>

Hey, hey, leave the monkey
in the corner.

No, leave him.
Leave him in the corner.

He said leave the monkey
in the corner, you stupid tit.

Listen to me, fruitcake.

I need to know exactly
where this Russian sausage

I need to know exactly
where this Russian sausage

and his beefcake boyfriend are.

<i>Do you hear me?</i>

Jackhammer.

Whatever.

Whatever, whatever,
whatever, whatever.

Look, I'll see you around
downtown, Charlie brown.

Who's gonna see who
around now, brown cow?

<i>I don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

Just pull up doodle earth.

Now doodle "jackhammer."

Now doodle "jackhammer."

Ha, ha, ha, we have a
track on their location.

Ha, ha.

You found them
through doodle earth?

Oh, yeah, it's in their
latest software update.

What is it, free or--?

No, it's 99 cents.

<i>That's where they get you.</i>

I know, right?

<i>We're sending you
the coordinates.</i>

How could I have been
so blind, tubbses?

How could I have been
so blind, tubbses?

Samantha is the only one
I've ever cared for.

I am an emotional dwarf.

Come on, hammer,
don't be ridiculous.

You're not an emotional dwarf.

Yes, I am.

A little man of emotions,
so to speak.

<i>Sometimes certain people
just take longer to realize</i>

what they feel inside.

Love is a complicated thing.

I guess I thought I was
protein depleted inside

whenever Samantha was around.

I got the dizzies and stuff.

<i>But it's too late.</i>

Samantha said
whatever we had was over.

She went with the horse.

You know how I feel
about horses.

Hammer, Samantha's upset
about getting involved

with Lance's blackmail money,
not about anything else.

Maybe we should think harder

about getting out of this
tomorrow

and start from scratch
in New York.

Tubbses, I guarantee you
Igor's out there right now

making sure that we don't
skip town tomorrow.

It's not worth it.

<i>I can't risk him putting
his dirty Russian fingers</i>

<i>on you again.</i>

<i>It's disgusting.</i>

<i>Damn, I hate Russians.</i>

How you doing today?

How you doing today?

Good dude. Dude, good.

Need a haircut and a beard cut.

There's just a few people
ahead of you.

Can I get your name please?

Oh, Keith... Kiefer sutherland.

I'm sorry it had to
turn out this way, hammer.

I want to thank you for what
you're doing for me, really.

<i>Anything but a chicken wing,
Crockett and tubbs, baby.</i>

Agghhh!

Hammer, are you all right?

Hammer?

Hammer?

I told you I'd get you
basket-weaving numbnuts.

What's your problem, man?

Woman? Whatever.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

What he meant to say is,

we were never the ones
that you had a beef with.

I didn't have beef
with you, fool.

I'm a vegetarian.

But I'd make
an exception for you.

But I'd make
an exception for you.

I would eat you in a second
and your stupid friend.

Bellyful of a-hole.

Oh, look.

We might have something
that you might like.

What's your problem?

I wanted to show you
that I wasn't playing around.

Now, I do like rewards.

Start talking, fools.

I got to go get it.

I got to go get it.

I can go get it.
I got to go get it.

Faster. Faster,
talk more and faster.

Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

Shut up. Talk, shut up, talk.

I'll talk to you.

We'll figure this all out, okay?

Jesus.

What's going on?
Did the deal go down?

Well, get the look out
so you can see.

<i>What's going on? Is money there?</i>

<i>Is deal go down?</i>

Deal go down.

<i>Okay, get in car.</i>

What you looking at?
What you see?

Well, give me binocular.

What is this piece of shit?

Next time, get real binocular.

There they are.

I know, I am not blind.
Put down stupid binocular.

Make sure you stick
to the plan, alright?

<i>What the fuck?</i>

He's going in the wrong trailer.

What the fuck? You wait here.

Hammer, hammer,
you're in the wrong trailer.

Hammer, whose trailer is this?

Hey, stupid hammer.

Hammer, what you doing?

I give you job in strip show.

I am not a ballerina.

Get ready to point
your toes, little ballerina.

It's payback time.

<i>Get him, muffin.</i>

<i>Point your toe.</i>

<i>Noooo!</i>

Jackhammer!

<i>I got to make one quick stop,</i>

<i>all right, tubbses?</i>

Wake up.

Wake up.

Gracias, amigo.

This is important, man.

You guys gotta
help me out, cool?

Gracias, amigos.

Samantha.

<i>Samantha.</i>

Hammer. What are you doing here?

Hammer. What are you doing here?

<i>Just go.</i>

Samantha, no. Please.

Roses are red, violets are blue.

I know what you're thinking,
I pity the fool.

I'm so sorry, Sam,
I've been immature.

But underneath the hard hammer,
I've been a bit insecure.

How could I have been so blind
not to see what you did.

You've opened the hammer's eyes
to see that I was stupid.

When I met you on the plane
in seat 16c,

I didn't even watch
the in-flight movie

and I always do.

Since that day in the clouds,
I've been a big dork

but you're the Adrian
to my rocky,

the mindy to my mork.

I'm ready to change.

I'm ready to morph.

Samantha, I no longer want to be
that emotional dwarf.

Roses are red, violets are blue.

Roses are red, violets are blue.

I know it's too late, Samantha.

Let the hammer love you.

I love you, Samantha.

Gracias, amigo.

Gracias.

Hammer, come here.

That was pretty cheesy.

Look, I am so sorry.

I know the hammer's been
a huge doucher

I know the hammer's been
a huge doucher

and all I want to do
is just make it up to you.

<i>â™ª I need your help
baby this way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I need your loving
every day yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I need your help
baby this way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I need your loving-- â™ª</i>

Bam, that's what
I'm talking about.

Whoa!

<i>â™ª Since you've gone baby-- â™ª</i>
