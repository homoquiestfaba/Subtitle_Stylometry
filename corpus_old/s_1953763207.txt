[ Clears Throat ]

[ Sighs ]

If you're watching this,
you've discovered something
you shouldn't have.

[ Chuckles ]

Anyway, um--

[ Slide Projector Clicks ]

This-- This is a close-up
of a model's eye.

Yeah.
I can't remember her name
to save my life,

but she had the bluest eyes
I've ever seen.

The only other time
I remember seeing this exact
intensity of blue...

was the day
my sister drowned.

It was everywhere.

It was in the water,
in the sky, Nicole's skin.

Blue.
I remember.

And gold.

The gold of the light
off the surface of the water.

Like an empty frame
flashing onto the screen.

Nicole.

She's the one girl
I keep trying to remember.

But I-- I think
she's the problem.

I think she's the reason
I am the way I am, right?

Maybe I should back up
and try to explain
what the hell happened here.

<i>Jesus Christ.</i>
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>did happen here?</i>

<i>Um--</i>

[ Continues ]
Well, let's start with me.

My name is Kevin Wolfe.

I'm a studio photographer.

I do head shots,
and most of my clients
are girls.

Girls.

They've sort of been the focus
of my whole fucking life.

They're sort of
a problem for me.

I've just been trying
to find a way to forget
all the bad experiences...

and try to have
at least one good one, so...

every girl that comes
into this studio--

every actress, every model--

I ask out.

Would you like
to see a movie?

And they almost always say--

[ Laughs ]
No.

And so, I do
this forgetting thing.

It's like a ritual.

I mean, I know it sounds weird,
but you gotta do
something positive...

to cancel out
the negative experiences,
right?

Um, for instance,

I forgot Theresa
by going to Coney Island.

And before Theresa
there was Carrie,

who decided to stand me up
at the movies.

Forgot her
by watching every single
episode of <i>Lost</i> on DVD.

And then, uh--

Then there was Sheila.

She was a real girl, you know?

Not like most actresses--
not fake.

Although she does look
really overdone here.

My assistant Jamie,

she sometimes went
a little crazy with the makeup.

Anyway, I remember asking--
Are you single?

Um, I'm only 19.

Oh.

Um, do you have
a-- a boyfriend?

Oh, no. No, I don't.

Maybe we could go
to a-a movie sometime?

Uh--
[ Chuckles ]

Sure.

Yeah. Uh, sure.
Um--

I-- I like movies.

[ Kevin Narrating ]
A lot of girls have
a hard time saying no,

especially if they're from Iowa
or some fucking place.

It's like they're trying
to be polite all the time.

But, anyway, she called
the day we were supposed
to go out...

and she said she'd forgotten
about other plans.

Some relative was in
from out of town, I think,
or something, blah, blah, blah.

I forgot her
by going to the newsstand.

Flipping through
the fashion magazines,

the pictures of
the skinny supermodels,

the emaciated
and beautiful.

And then, uh,
there are the ones who are
not so easy to forget...

because they are the ones
who said--

Yes.

Okay.

[ Chuckling ]

This looks great.
Thanks.

It's a great smile.

Have you done
a lot of acting?

I mean, theater or--

Um, a few years ago,
I went on some auditions.

[ Exhales ]
And then I met this guy,

and... now I'm a hostess.

[ Chuckling ]
But I'm planning on
getting back into it.

How old are you?

How old am I?

Why do you want to know
how old I am?

Where'd you grow up?

Who said I ever grew up?

[ Laughing ]
Oh.

Well, where'd you
go to school?

You know, usually, how
this works is that I'm usually
the one asking questions.

Oh.

[ Chuckles ]
What are you doing tonight?

What am I doing?

Do you want to go out
with me, Kevin?

Oh, like what?
Like a movie?

I was thinking
more like a bar.

Okay.

[ Moaning ]

[ Girl ]
Kevin.

I had a bad dream.

â™ª [ Humming ]

<i>[ Coughing ]</i>

[ Shutter Clicks ]

[ Shutter Clicks ]
[ Moans ]

[ Clicks ]

Oh, my God.

Good morning.
Are you taking pictures
of me?

Taking one picture.
Here.

See? You look beautiful.
[ Scoffs ]

Not likely.
Yeah, you do.

[ Exhales ]
Oh, God.

What time is it?

[ Chuckles ]

Oh, my God.

I don't want you to get
the wrong idea about me.

Get the wrong idea?

What wrong idea?

Um--

Yeah. I mean,
I can't believe
that I, like--

Listen, I'm not, uh--

I'm not the type of person
that just wants to--

Uh, fuck.

Listen, I know that--
I know that I really don't
know you at all, Adrienne.

I can't even think
of your last name
at the moment.

But-- And it's safe to say
that you don't know me,

but...

I really feel
that we made this--

this connection.

Right?

Uh, a connection?
Yeah.

I mean, you're here,
I'm here,

and I just feel
like there's this--
there's a spark.

I mean, what I want,
really, is just--

I just want a girl,
you know?

I mean, I'm just a guy.
I mean, I'm not, like,
a fashion photographer.

It's nothing glamorous.
I just do head shots, you know--

300 a digital set,
prints are extra.

It's the deal I gave you,
essentially.
Yeah.

Um, hey, listen.

Yesterday was, like,
a really, um, weird day for me.

So--

Mmm.
Yeah.

Okay.

Sh-- Coffee?
Do you want coffee?

I could go down
to the corner--
No, thanks.

No, thanks.

You have to go to work?

Work. Yeah, I do.
Work.

Can I, um-- Can I
call you sometime?

Um, did I give you my number?

Oh. Wow.

Uh, yeah, you gave it
to Jamie on the card...

so that I could call you
when the pictures were ready.
Oh! Right, right.

Awkward.
Okay.

Thanks!

Fuck. Fucking fuck.

I am such a fucking idiot.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
I can't believe
how stupid I am.

[ Doorbell Buzzing ]

No idea how
to talk to people--
girls in particular.

[ Chuckling ]

Hi. I really think we had
this connection, right?
[ Buzzing ]

[ Singsongy ]
Hi! We have a connection.
I really think, uh--

Stupid.
I'm so fucking stupid.
I'm stupid.

I'm such a fucking moron.
I'm such a fucking dumb-ass
piece of shit.

Fucking brain--

Hey.

Hi.

Do you wanna go camping?

Uh, Derek and me were--

Derek and I
are going camping,
and we want you to go.

And I was thinking
you could do some of
your nature photography.

You know,
if you don't want to,
that is totally fine.

Please tell me
you're kidding, right?

Yeah. [ Chuckles ]
I was kidding.
You're kidding.

Yeah. I got you.
You got me.

I'm going to
go set up now.
Okay.

<i>[ Computer: Popping Sound ]</i>

[ Typing ]

[ Woman ]
Do you have any pictures
to show me?

Nah.

You never show me
your pictures.

[ Chuckles ]
They're just girls.

They're just...
head shots.

They're boring, Ruby.
They'd bore you.

Girls are nice.
[ Chuckles Softly ]

You wouldn't like 'em.
Trust me, Ruby.

You wouldn't like
any of 'em.

They're not dirty pictures,
are they?

Come on.

I've seen those magazines.
I know what all kinds of
pictures they have out there.

They're not dirty.
You're taking dirty pictures!

You are crazy, Ruby.
You are a crazy old woman.

You shouldn't call me Ruby.
You should call me Grandma.

Ruby, can I see
the pictures of Nicole?

She wasn't supposed to be
called "Nicole," you know,

because that was
your mother's name.

I know.

But when she died,
we thought it was fitting.

Just a newborn baby,
and a little girl and all.

Such a pretty little baby.

It was fitting she should
have your mother's name.

Oh, your mother--

I guess it was just
one of those things.

They said they
couldn't have known.

And I thought
I could console myself
with little Nicole.

You're all I've got left.

[ Typing ]

[ Message Popping ]

Fuck.

It's not that you're
a bad guy or anything.

I mean, you seem like
you're really nice.

It's just--
I don't know--

like you seem
kind of like, um--

You know, like, with
the whole connection thing?

And then, plus, the mood
that I was in when we--

You know, um, I was kind of
acting something out.

I mean, you--
you asked me out,
you know.

Why would you ask me out?
I mean, I don't--

I'm sorry.

It's not something
that you should do
lightly, you know.

You know what?
Thank you for the head shots.

I, uh-- Yeah, I have some,
uh, extra prints in here,
if you want them.

And I ended up using
one of them, actually,
for my flyer.

I hope that doesn't
bother you.

Oh, no, it's fine.
And these are fine.

Yeah.
Um--

It is fine.
It's gonna be fine.
It's totally fine.

It's, uh-- Don't even
feel bad about it.

You know,
I know a lot of girls.

Um, it's just--

I felt... I felt like
we had a, uh--

Hey, Kevin.

I'm sorry.

Me too.

You know when you're
in a museum and you're
looking at a painting,

and it's really
freaking you out?

It's all jagged and awful,
and it gets inside you?

Then you just turn your head
and walk through the door...

into another room
of the museum,

and you're looking
at another painting--

a calculation of colors,
abstract and meaningless,
but beautiful.

So beautiful.

Just waiting for you...

if you just walk through.

Hi.

Uh, my name's Kevin Wolfe.
I'm a studio photographer.

I do head shots,
$300 a digital set.
Prints are extra.

You've probably
seen my flyers--

all over the city?

No?
Sounds like you've said that
a few times before.

[ Laughs ]
Yeah, I think I even
say it in my sleep.

Well, I mean, it's okay
if you haven't seen 'em.

It's probably not something
you'd pay attention to anyway.

I mean, unless, of course,
you know, you wanted to
get head shots, right?

I mean, are you,
uh, an actor?

Yeah, uh,
actually, I need some.

Yeah?

I'm Beth.

Beth, uh--
Beth Dalewell.

Beth Dalewell.

Are you, uh, enjoying
the play so far?

Yeah. Uh, so far
it's all right.

Just all right?
Yeah.

I don't know.
It's kind of embarrassing,
isn't it?

I mean, the guy's
walking around in white tights
pretending to be a swan.

I don't know.
We're actually supposed
to believe he is one.

Yeah.
[ Laughs ]
[ Chuckles ]

Did-- Did you produce it
or something?

Oh, no. No, no, no.
I mean--

I did the head shots
for someone in that cast.

Yep. And plus,
I'm just a fan
of the theater.

Oh, fuck.
I can't believe
I just said that.

[ British Accent ]
"I'm a fan of the theater."

"The theater."

I'm sorry.
I'm just an idiot.

No, you're--
you're funny.

I'm funny? What do you--
What do you mean?

I don't know. You're just--
You're just funny.

[ Chuckles ]

So--

[ Metal Rattling ]

Are you, um,
coming from Kevin's?

Uh, yeah.
Just picking up
some head shots.

Photos.

Are you an actress?

[ Chuckles ]
I'd like to be.

What do you do?

Nothing.

Really?
[ Chuckling ]

I'm sort of the--
the landlord.

Oh.

I feel like I'm just
like this worthless
piece of shit...

that, like, exists in the world
for absolutely no reason.

And, like, I should
just essentially be dead,
and everyone would be happier.

Like everyone else
has a reason to be alive,

and I'm just, like,
this worthless failure
that has no... point.

Okay, Jamie.
James. Listen.

I look in the mirror,
and I'm just like--

I just feel like I'm so ugly
and hideous, and I--
â™ª [ Hard Rock ]

Jamie, listen.
You're not hideous, Jamie.
You're not ugly at all.

Will you-- Will you stop
being so negative?

<i>Why don't you try</i>
<i>being positive?</i>

<i>Think about--</i>
<i>Think about anything.</i>
<i>I know, Derek.</i>

I know it is your job
to talk me down, okay?

And--
[ Sighs ]

I'm not gonna
drink anything, okay?

And thank you, you know?
Thank you.

You're like
my only friend
in the entire world,

and that is why I call you,
because you're nice, you know?

You're a very, very,
very nice sponsor.

I'm really gla--
Can you hold on?

I have another call.

Hello?
<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

[ Sighs ]

Hi, Mom.
<i>I didn't interrupt</i>
<i>anything?</i>

No.
<i>I can call you back</i>
<i>if you want.</i>

No.
<i>What are you doing?</i>

I was just on the other line
with the suicide hotline, so--

<i>Really?</i>
<i>Yeah. They said</i>
<i>I should do it.</i>

<i>Oh, my God, Jamie.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>I'm kidding.</i>

I'm kidding, Mom.
<i>Why would you</i>
<i>scare me like that?</i>

Can you please
hold on for a second?

The swan started crying,
you know?

The dancing was one thing,
and then-- and then, yeah.

[ Buzzing ]

[ Door Buzzes ]

Hi.
Hey.

So, I still need you
to get me a key
for the downstairs,

and then you wouldn't
have to buzz me in
every time I come to work.

I don't mind it,
but since I already have
the upstairs key,

and I know it bothers you--
I keep forgetting
about that.

Would you mind making
some coffee, please?
Yes.

So... you know how
I was telling you
Derek is gay?

I know you knew he was gay,
but all of my best friends
are always gay.

"Fag hag."
That's what they used to
call me in high school.

Because my best friend
was gay-- Tony.

Oh, my God.
You would like Tony.

The weird thing is
is that I have never known
any lesbians.

I mean, I don't think
I'd get along with one.

Although,
who's to judge?
I don't know.

Maybe I've known
a lot of lesbians
and didn't know. God.

If I was friends with lesbians
in high school, they couldn't
have called me "fag hag."

They'd have to call me
something else like
"lesbi-friend." [ Chuckles ]

Oh, shit.

You didn't think,
a minute ago,

that I was saying
I thought you were gay,

'cause that is not
what I was saying.

I would not want you
to think-- That's not--

[ Exhales ]
Wow.

So, yeah, Derek
is not my boyfriend,

and I wouldn't even want
Derek to be my boyfriend
even if he wasn't gay.

I mean-- [ Giggles ]
You know what I'm saying?
Kevin?

Sorry.
<i>[ Knocking ]</i>

Jesus Christ, Tanner.
It's dark as hell in here.

Sorry.

I need to borrow your--
your car this weekend.
Is that all right?

What have you got
in your hand?

Just pictures.
Photographs.

Let's see.

I don't think so.

If you want
to borrow the Impala,
show me the pictures.

That's a good boy.

Mmm.
[ Mocking ]
Mmm.

I saw this one on the poster.

Wait a minute.
You mean you actually
left your apartment?

[ Chuckling ]
Hilarious.

Did you fuck her?

Let's look at yours.

Mine are better.
Yeah, I'm sure.

[ Clears Throat ]

Hmm, hmm, hmm.

Aw! God.

Look at this one.
What is--
What is that?

That's a fish.

Why would she--

Look at this one.

Yeah. Oh.

Where do you get
this shit?

Come on, Kevin.
This is beautiful.

You're so fucked up.

Yeah.

Can I keep this?

Yeah, it's yours.

Thanks.

Don't you want this?

No.
Why?

What'd you do to her?

[ Door Closes ]
[ Chuckling ]

I guess I scared her.

Yeah, apparently.

Apparently,
I do that sometimes.

[ Hisses ]

Anyway, Adrienne's memory
played on in my psyche...

like one of those
extended remixes...

over and over and over.

How did I forget her?

[ Phone Rings ]

Hello?
<i>Hey, it's Kevin.</i>

<i>You, uh-- You still</i>
<i>going camping?</i>

Yes.

So I'm pretty much not sure
what I'm going to call it yet.

It could either be
a "uni-peg" or a "pega-corn,"

or I could just call it
something really simple
like "flying horse with horn."

You know what I mean?
If I just need to
keep it simple.

But basically, it's like
the most incredible animal
that's ever existed.

It's half unicorn,
half Pegasus.

So it's like a flying horse
with wings and a horn.

I can't even tell you
how important the Pegasus
on its own, without a horn,

has been essentially
since I was, like, born.

'Cause when I was a kid,
I had this game called
Dark Tower.

It's, like, there's this tower,
and it's called
the Dark Tower.

And there's all these things
like Brigands-- I think
the Brigand is the bad guy.

Then there's this other--
like you have rations.

Oh, yeah. And you go
to the Bazaar.

It spins around,
and I don't know--
Jamie.

Could you stop, like--
Could you stop talking, please?
For like a second.

I'm sorry.
[ Laughs ]

I'm really sorry.
No, don't be sorry.

You just-- You make me
nervous, I guess.

There's nothing
to be nervous about.

There isn't?
No. I like you, okay?

Just-- with the talking,
please just be calm, okay?

For an exercise.
Because I want
to be quiet.

I mean, I really do.
It's like I want my mouth
to just die.

But then, like,
all of a sudden,
it's back.

It resurrects like Christ,
and then it's like--
Jamie!

Please!
I am begging you.

Sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

I'll shut up.

She told me how she feels
about you, Kevin.

You might take that
into consideration.

What are you talking about?

Jamie's... very fragile.

I'm not saying
she'd do anything, but--

Just do me a favor
and be nice to her.

Yeah.

Yeah, of course.

[ Giggling ]

[ Laughter, Echoing ]

Everybody loves him.
He's very talented.

[ Nicole Laughing,
Echoing ]

Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

Tweet, tweet,
tweet, tweet!

[ Adrienne ]
I'm sorry.
Tweet, tweet.

Tweet, tweet!

[ Kevin Narrating ]
In the end, I did end up
forgetting Theresa...

and Doris and Allison
and Sheila and Adrienne...

and-- and all of them.

I mean, it's not that
I forgot them literally though.

It's just I made it
so I didn't care anymore.

See? That's a picture
of me not caring.

[ Chuckles ]

Ah, anyway, um,

I decided I had to
try to remember more
about my sister Nicole,

what happened.

Try to really find
the answer this time,

try to figure out...
why I'm like this.

All right, Ruby.
Are you comfortable?

What do you
want me to do?

Well, I just-- I want
to record you, okay?

I want to--

I want to record
some of your stories
about the old days...

because, uh--

I mean, what happens
when you're gone, right?

I mean,
no one's gonna know
what you know.

So, I just want you
to talk, all right?

Just like normal.
Forget that the camera's
even here.

What do you want me
to talk about?

Talk about Mom.

Talk about Nicole.

[ Knocking ]

What is it?
Uh, there's someone here.

I didn't have an appointment.
It's not a good time.

I think you should
come out here, Kevin.

Hi.
Um, my name is
Denise Gilcrest,

and this is my--
this is Mike Haley.

What--
What can I do for you?

Well--

Adrienne.
She's my sister.

You're Kevin Wolfe, right?
Yeah. Yeah.

I took these pictures.
Have you seen her?

Uh, no.
I mean, not for a while.
You know.

Why? Is-- Is she--

She's been missing.
Missing?

Did you know her?
Me? No.

No, I just saw her
when we did the pictures.

But you knew her
better than that,
didn't you, Kevin?

Yeah. I mean,
we went out one night, um,
and then that was it.

I mean, I called her once
after that, and then we saw
each other briefly, but--

Do you remember
what day that was?
Yeah, that was on--

Uh, when was that?
[ Laughing ]

Uh, no, actually I don't
remember exactly.

Well, where did you go?

We went to a diner
on 43rd Street,
and then, uh--

Yeah, are you sure
she didn't just take off?

Is that-- I mean,
you called her friends
and everything?

If she just took off,
she did it with none
of her belongings--

no suitcase,
no money, nothing.

The detectives think
it's really unlikely, so--

She would have
called her sister,
don't you think?

Are the police, like--
Are they helping you guys?

Hardly.

So, can you tell us
what you talked about
the last time you saw her?

Um, yeah.
Well, I gave her these
pictures, and then, uh--

and then, geez, what did we--
then we talked about, um--

Well, we talked about
why she didn't really
wanna see me.

She was breaking up
with you?

Ye-- Well, I mean,
we had hardly left it
at that.

Do you guys
want coffee or--

Hmm.

Oh!

You are one sick
motherfucker.

Ah, you're just as interested
in these pictures as I am.

Mm-mmm.

No, I like real girls.

Yeah, but even these girls
won't do it...

unless there's a camera there.

It's true.

The camera--
That's what makes
all this magic happen.

You do have a point.
Which is exactly why
you became a photographer.

So that you could get girls
to do twisted shit...

like... that.

I don't take pictures
like this.

What about that one?

It's not pornographic.
She's naked.

Yeah, but it's different.
It's completely different.

Oh, yeah. I mean,
if I were you, I would--

I'm not really interested
in what their bodies look
like in these pictures.

Would Adrienne do
something like--

[ Mouse Clicks ]
that?

No.

See her eyes?

Yeah?
Yeah, like,
the way they're flat.

Looks like
she doesn't even care,

like it doesn't
even matter.
Yeah.

That's exactly
what I don't like.

When I have a girl
at the studio,

she's, like--

She's doing it for
a whole different reason.

She's looking at the camera
in a completely different way,
like--

like she's looking out
at you from the inside.

And you see it.

You see that spark.

You see that life.

Good.

Good. This is really good.
Have you modeled before?

No. I'm an actress.
[ Phone Ringing ]

I mean, I want
to be an actress.

Right.
Wolfe Photography.
Hello.

Uh, Kevin's busy
right now.
Who is it?

Just some girl.
What girl?

Uh, Beth,
her name is.

Beth.
Give me the phone.

Hold on. Kevin wants
to talk to you.

Hold on for one second.
Beth?

Hi!
Beth from the play, right.

Kevin won
a, uh, portrait award
in college.

I don't know
if you know that.
It's true.

I'm Jamie, by the way.

I've been doing
Kevin's makeup--

Well, not Kevin's makeup
because Kevin doesn't actually
wear any makeup,

but makeup for his clients,
you know.

Girls like you--
actresses and models.

You're not a model,
are you?
Mm-mmm.

No. Hmm.

Good. I'm so glad
that you called.

<i>Your pitch</i>
<i>was pretty hard to forget.</i>

Remember Beth? Hmm?

Those big, watery eyes.

Her mouth permanently curved
into a half smile.

I'll never forget the day that
she looked me dead in the eye
and she said--

Okay.

You will?

What do you wanna see?

Um, I don't know.
Whatever.

Anything
that you wanna see.
You can pick it.

Okay. I'll call you.

Later this afternoon,
I'll find something
and I'll call you.

Good.
Okay, yeah, call me.

[ Laughs ]
Good.

Okay.

[ Kevin Narrating ]
I was starting
to get giddy inside.

Like all of a sudden,
I had another chance.

It was like Adrienne
had never happened.
Forget Adrienne!

[ Chuckles ]
Just relax.

I knew exactly what
was gonna happen next.

It was gonna be awesome.

Truly, incredibly,
amazingly fantastic.

Easily the greatest
romantic experience
of my entire...

fucking... life.

You're incredibly blotchy.
[ Kevin ]
What are you talking about?

Step away with that thing,
please. Please.

[ Chuckles ]

Maybe afterwards
we could grab a bite to eat?

Maybe.

Maybe.

[ Chains Jangling ]

There's nothing wrong
with me, is there?
No.

He could-- He could--

I mean, if I really
made an effort--

You would totally
have to help me, Derek.

Jamie.
He could go for me,
right?

Jamie.
He's all I ever
think about, Derek.

I know.
He's all I ever have
on my mind.

And sometimes I think
if I could just get him away
from those girls for one minute,

if I could just get them out
of the fucking picture--

There's always
another one.

Maybe you should keep
your options open.

There are a lot of boys
out there.

Kevin can't be
the only one, can he?

He kind of is.

[ Slurping ]

What was she like, Ruby?

What was her--
her personality like?

Oh.

She was full of energy.

She was rambunctious.

Not like you.
You were always quiet,

always such
a quiet little boy.

You were very sensitive,
you know.

Oh, but I was
so proud of you.

So proud.

Of both of you.

You were
such good children.

A boy and a girl.

Wish your mother
could have seen you.

She never even saw
your sister at all,
did she?

She never even saw
what Nicole looked like.

She never--
She never got to see
her own daughter.

How could I have lost
my two girls like that?

Hey, hey.
Hey.

Thought I
wouldn't make it?

Hmm. I wasn't sure.

Uh, we don't have to
see this particular movie
if you don't want to.

I mean, there are
a lot we can go to.

Yeah, this is fine.
I really wanted to see this,
you know, so--

And besides, I already
bought the tickets.

Yeah.

Um, do you want
some popcorn?
Sure.

What about--

What about the day
that she-- you know--

in the pool?

Kevin. I can't.

You can't remember?

It was my fault.

I wasn't there.
I wasn't--

I know you tried.

Did you see me?

Did you see me try?

You know what I like to do
sometimes, Derek?

Sometimes I like to imagine
that I have this whole bottle
of little blue pills.

<i>[ Derek ]</i>
<i>Why blue?</i>

I don't know.
I just like the color, I guess.

And then, I take
these little blue pills...

and I line them up
on the bed, one by one.

Jamie, why are you
telling me this?

<i>I'm just making</i>
<i>conversation, Derek.</i>

Then I take the pills--
â™ª [ Rock, Faint ]

and I push them
into my mouth.

Past my lips.

But you don't have
any... of those pills.

<i>Do you?</i>

No.
[ Chuckles ]

No, of course not.
<i>'Cause if you did,</i>
<i>you would tell me.</i>

I tell you everything, Derek.
You're my sponsor.

[ Sighs ]
I just feel like,
why did she have to call him?

<i>Who, Jamie?</i>

Her name is--
[ Sighs ]
B-E-T-H.

Jamie, I'm--
I'm gonna ask you to
do something for me.

I'm gonna put down the phone.

And I want you
to look at yourself.

This is gonna sound stupid,
but I want you to look
at yourself in the mirror,

and I want you
to tell yourself
that you're pretty.

[ Sighs ]

Did you hear me?
Are you serious?

<i>Do that for me, Jamie.</i>

Are-- Are you gonna stay
on the phone?

<i>I'm right here.</i>

[ Sighs ]
Okay.

â™ª [ Continues, Faint ]

You... are--

[ Sighs ]
You... are--

[ Exhales ]
Fuck you.

Go fuck yourself!

I'm not even fucking
kidding around right now.

Go fuck yourself,
you stupid piece of shit!

I fucking hate you!

I fucking hate you,
and I want you to fucking die!

[ Woman ]
â™ª The holy crosses

[ Buzzer Buzzes Twice ]
Shit.

Co-- Coming.

Did you find her?

No.

Did you ask anyone
in the diner?

Nobody remembers
you two being there.

Where's your boyfriend?
Kevin.

Do you mind if I
ask you a question?

No, not at all.

Did you do something to her?

[ Gasps ]
Listen, I-I--

I am really sorry
if something bad has happened
to your sister. I really am.

But it was her decision to not
see <i>me</i> anymore, you know?

That was her choice,
not mine.

I've just been trying
to forget I ever met her.

I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

I don't know what I'm doing.
Just tell me--
Tell me how to help.

I just don't know
where she is.

I know. Gee.

[ Sniffles ]
I'm so sorry.
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

[ Sobs Softly ]
[ Whispers ]
It's okay.

That was good.
The movie?

Oh, no, the--
the pizza.

Was it, uh,
Ray's Original
or Famous Ray's?

Famous Ray's Original.

[ Both Chuckle ]
[ Door Closes Upstairs ]

Um, you can kiss me now.

Really?

[ Chuckles ]

Hey, hey.

Sorry. Not, uh--
Not yet.
What?

[ Chuckles ]
Um--

Kevin. Kevin. Kevin,
come on. I said stop.
[ Glass Overturns ]

Shit.
Okay.

Sorry.

I just, uh--

Sorry.
I thought that we had a--
[ Clears Throat ]

Oh.
Sorry.

No. You're really nice,
you know. Uh--

Nice.
And I really like you.
[ Chuckles ]

And... I just--

I just barely know you.
You know? I mean, we just, um--

I just met you.
And I--

I just think, you know,
I gotta wait a little.

I mean, you've just
gotta be patient.

But I love you.

[ Kevin Narrating ]
Suddenly, I could see
directly into the future.

Sorry.

I could see the days
unfolding in front of me
like pages of a newspaper.

Huh.
What do you mean?

[ Kevin Narrating ]
And I realized that Beth
was far, far away.

I would have to forget Beth
with some... severity.

It wouldn't be easy.

Forgetting Beth
would not be easy at all.
[ Sniffles ]

If I told her the truth--
This is bullshit.
I'm sorry. This--

If I told her who I really was--

I probably should go.

[ Kevin Narrating ]
she would hate me.

Uh, Kev. Uh--

Why would she go out with me
in the first place?
What the fuck is wrong with her?

Kevin--

What the fuck is wrong with <i>me?</i>

I just--

[ Kevin Narrating ]
And I guess I hadn't really
forgotten Adrienne after all.

Sometimes nothing
can help you forget a girl
better than another one.

[ Cell Phone Rings ]
Hello?

Hey, it's me.
What are you doing?

What happened to your date?
<i>What date?</i>

Oh.

Uh, are you hungry?

No.

Will you meet me?
Okay.

The truth is,
women are objects.

I mean, the feminists
can say what they want,

but when it comes
right down to it,

girls are made of bones...

and muscle...
and blood.

And you're over there.

[ Clicks Tongue ]
You're right behind the camera,
looking at them,

creating a moment,
an object in space.

And you're saying--
Smile.

Look this way.
And smooth your hair just back
a little off your eye.

<i>[ Kevin Narrating ]</i>
<i>And they're saying--</i>
<i>- How do you want me?</i>

Here?
Like this?

And you're saying... yes.

Yes, I want you exactly...

Is this helping you with

Do you know what I need?
What?

I need whiskey.

Neat.

Do you want to go get a drink?

Yeah.

That would be fantastic.

Okay.

Or actually, you know, that I--

so... who knows?

Who knows?
He might still be alive.

Um-- And then
when I was eight
or... seven.

Uh-- Something like that--
Eight, seven.

I... had a sister.
Uh, Nicole.

I have a dead sister...
named Nicole.

[ Coughs ]
What-What happened to her?

[ Wincing ]
You know, I don't know.

I, uh-- It's hard

I, uh--

She drowned in the pool.

She drowned?
Yeah.

Oh, my God.
[ Nervous Chuckle ]

It's okay, Kevin.

Is it?
Yeah.

It's fine.

I don't pay you enough.
Oh, my God.

Jamie, I don't.
Come on.

I don't.
I mean, here we are,
we're sitting here.

I feel like I can
tell you anything.

You can.
Yeah.

I feel like I can--

I-I can explain myself
to you.
You can.

I feel like--

I feel like
you understand.

I do, Kevin.
Yeah.

I do.
I-I do understand.

I understand
absolutely everything.

Anything that you
could ever say to me,
I would understand.

And there's something that I've
been wanting to tell you too.

For a really long time, okay?
Mm-hmm.

And that is that...
I told my mom...

that you were my boyfriend.
[ Laughs ]

And, like, I know
that I shouldn't have.

Oh, and another thing:
I've been following you.

When you're with those girls.
Just to make sure you're okay.

And I know that I shouldn't
and everything, but I just--

I don't know. I wanted
to make sure you were okay.

And I just felt, like,
a little bit jealous,
and, uh-- I don't know.

It's just that I've always felt
like we have this amazing
connection, you know?

And, like, the first time
I ever met you--

[ Kevin Narrating ]
It was like
I was watching again.

I mean, I was there
with Jamie, in the bar,

sitting on the hard stool.

But my true self
was actually up in the ceiling,

looking down,
watching myself sitting there.

I could see Jamie too.

[ Door Closes ]

[ Woman ]
â™ª I left you on the bed

â™ª And took all the money

[ Grunts ]
[ Screams, Chuckles ]

[ Breathing Heavily ]

â™ª Gonna buy you something

[ Breathing Heavily ]
You're here.

You're here.
I am.

I've loved you for so long.

I know.

I've always loved you.
[ Whimpers ]

I know.

It's okay.

[ Moans ]
Okay.

This is Jean. Jean.

Forgotten after
a full-release body massage.

[ Groans ]
Oh, this is Fiona.

Uh-- I forgot Fiona by joining
a gym I never ended up going to.

Brenda. I forgot Brenda
at the Museum of Modern Art.

I forgot... Mary.

Forgot Sarah.

Forgot Kelly.

I forgot--

Forgot.

Forgot.

Forgot.

[ Exhales ]

[ Grunts ]

Holy shit.

[ Kevin Narrating ]
I had to do something radical,

something to forget all this
in a major way.

I was really going
out of my mind, I admit.

And I don't think I knew--
I mean, I--

I knew what was going on,
what was happening.

But I had to find some way
of canceling it all out.

Of forgetting Beth,
forgetting Adrienne...

and especially
forgetting Jamie.

I had to forget Jamie.

[ Buzzer Buzzes ]

[ Buzzes ]

[ Nicole ]
Kevie. Kevie!

[ Nicole Screams ]

made this-- this connection.

What do you mean?

But once I started,

I had to keep going.

more about Nicole, you know?

What the hell was she doing
in that pool anyway?
She wasn't allowed.

She was too little to swim.
I mean, I could barely
swim myself.

What was I supposed to do?

How was I supposed to save her?

[ Keys Jingling ]

[ Gasps ]
[ Keys Striking Floor ]

What are we gonna do

Mmm.

No, that's okay.
It's not a glamour shot,
Jamie.

Plus, I just--
I don't have any pictures
of you, that's all.

[ Whispers ]
Let's see.

You know, Jamie,
I've been thinking about--
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

I know.

I know that you
wouldn't do that. But--

You have to understand, I--

I can't go around
remembering all of this.

You know?
I have to forget.

Well-Well,
what about last night?

Do you have to forget--

[ Sighs ]
Jamie,

last night was...

a mistake.

[ Sighs, Sobs ]
Oh.

Do you know what I mean?

[ Sniffles ]

[ Inhales Deeply, Exhales ]

It's okay.
[ Sniffles ]

It's okay.

[ Whispers ]
It's okay.

'Cause I--
I have been thinking
about something...

for a really long time.

And I even told Derek
about it.

And he's trying
to talk me out of it, but...

I've got a whole--
whole fucking bottle.

[ Sniffles ]
Of what?

Blue pills.

Blue.

Blue.

Jamie,
it's gonna be beautiful.

It's gonna be
so beautiful.

You.
Beautiful?

You...

are gonna be so beautiful.

Beautiful.
So beautiful.

[ Sniffles ]

So beautiful.
I promise.
[ Sobs ]

[ Whispers ]
I promise.

I'll give you something.
[ Sobbing Continues ]

I wanna be beautiful
for you, Kevin.

I wanna be beautiful
for you.

[ Cries, Sniffles ]

[ Crying ]
Kevin, if you are watching this,

that means that you found me.

And I just want you to know...

<i>why I killed Beth Dalewell</i>
<i>in your studio.</i>

<i>[ Sniffles ]</i>
<i>And also,</i>

<i>why I took Adrienne</i>
<i>Gilcrest's life too.</i>

<i>I guess I was jealous.</i>

And now I have nothing left--
[ Sniffles ]

<i>to live for.</i>

<i>I have nothing left.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

This is Adrienne.

I forgot her on a camping trip.

This is Beth.

Forgotten.

And this is Jamie.

[ Sniffles ]

Where did you
get these anyway?

A doctor.

Said I was nervous.

You should wipe your
fingerprints off the bottle,
don't you think?

Don't worry.

[ Whispering ]
What if it doesn't work?

[ Whispering ]
It'll work.
[ Chuckles ]

[ Whimpers, Sighs ]

Kevin.
[ Unzips Boot ]

Can I keep my clothes on?

Sure. Sure,
you can keep 'em on.

[ Loud Whirring ]

[ Clears Throat ]

[ Sighs ]

If you're watching this,
you've discovered something
you shouldn't have.

[ Chuckles ]

Anyway, um--

This-- This is a close-up
of a model's eye.

I can't remember her name
to save my life, but she had
the bluest eyes I'd ever seen.

The only other time
I remember seeing this
exact intensity of blue...

was the day my sister drowned.

It was everywhere--

in the water, in the sky,
Nicole's skin.

Blue.

[ No Audible Dialogue ]

Nicole. She's the one girl
I keep trying to remember.

But I-- I think
she's the problem.

I think--
I think she's the reason...

I am the way I am, right?

This is what it looked like,
these flashes of white.

It was like
this empty slide.

The sun was flashing
off the water.

It was just like this.

Jesus.

I watched her.

I watched the whole thing.

Through the blue and the gold
and the white flashes.

The white...

flashes.

Flashes.
[ Nicole Screams ]

[ Whispers ]
Flashes.
[ Nicole Screams ]

[ Nicole ]
Kevie!

[ Nicole, Distorted ]
Kevin!

[ Nicole Screams ]

[ Nicole Gasping ]

Kevin!

[ Ruby's Voice, Echoing ]
Help me! Somebody help!

[ Woman ]
Do you remember
what happened, sweetheart?

[ Young Kevin ]
I just don't remember.

[ Kevin ]
I watched her.

I was looking through the light.

Into the heart of the light.

Into the silence.

I knew my baby sister
was drowning.

And I let it happen.

I watched it...

because it was beautiful.

I let it happen...

because it was
beautiful to see.

Under the water,
Nicole called my name.

What I saw
were flashes of light.

And what I heard--

What did I hear?

Put your hands
over your ears.

Press down.
