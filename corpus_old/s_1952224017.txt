Hello, there.
I bet you're already saying to yourself:

"Oh, I've already seen this one.

Another holiday special narrated
by some new teen star...

...between takes of their oh-so-popular
new sitcom series."

Well, I'm here to tell you,
"Not this time," because I'm not a star.

Well, not yet at least.

And this ain't about how
so-and-so saved Christmas...

...for all the good boys and girls.

It's more about Santa Claus
settling some unfinished business...

...with a very old acquaintance...

...and some kids who
accidentally destroy Christmas.

That's right, nothing under the trees.

A catastrophe caused by a kid... Me.

that was too smart for his own good.

A kid who messed up his hometown,
messed with Santa...

...messed with Christmas, and the
entire, complete known universe...

...or at least,
it almost worked out that way.

So grab yourself a
super-sized hot chocolate...

...sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride...

...because this is one
very special Christmas...

...you're never gonna forget.

So, Veronica, looks like another
green Christmas this year.

Sure does, Trevor. Your turn.

So, Veronica, hey.

I asked Santa for a
new chess set this year.

Okay.
Well, what did you ask him for?

Nothing, Trevor.

I don't believe in Santa Claus.

For real life? Come on.

Sorry, Trev. It's the skeptic in me.

I tend not to believe
in things I can't see.

Veronica, you don't have to
see him to believe he's real.

Let me get this straight.
You believe in an overweight guy...

...who rides around in a sleigh
pulled by "magic flying reindeer"?

Well, basically, yeah.

Trevor, Trevor, Trevor.
Think about it.

There are two billion
children in the world.

So, what's the problem?

Even if he's only giving
presents to a third of them...

...Santa's sleigh would have to
go 3,000 times the speed of sound.

Carry on.

Assuming each child gets
one medium-sized present...

...that weighs an average
half a kilogram.

The sleigh is carrying
400,000 metric tons...

...or the average weight
of an ocean liner.

Did you read this on the internet?

On land, conventional reindeer
can pull no more than 150 kilograms...

...even granting that flying reindeer
could pull 10 times the normal amount.

Well, I don't know how to
break this to you, Trevor...

...but it all sounds rather unlikely.

Interesting theory, Veronica.

Bravo, but Santa doesn't
ride the scientific wave.

He's magical.

Whatever.

By the way, checkmate.

A most dramatic game as usual,
Gabriel.

Yes, Errol.
My heart is still racing.

Trevor, I have one question.

Just curious, what was all that talk about
Santa Claus during the chess match?

Yeah, oh, what up with that, T?

You ruined a perfectly
good tournament.

I was trying to head fake her.

Get her off her game, you know,
distract her.

Distract her?

Trevor, you lost the game.
It only looks that way.

Excuse me. Hey, Ronnie!

You dropped something.

Allow me.

You know what your problem is?

You don't believe in magic.

It's in your other hand.

True. But what if it wasn't?
Trevor.

Can't we just agree
to disagree sometimes?

Okay, Veronica.

But I know Santa is real.
I know it in my heart.

It's probably just heartburn.

Very funny.

Cuddles, the rainbow
unicorn sparkle wand.

What are you looking at?

Oh, nothing.

You know, I was thinking. What if
I could prove to you Santa is real?

Prove it? How?
With physical evidence.

Physical evidence of Santa Claus?
Exactly.

All I have to do is, well, catch him.

You know, so you can
see him for yourself.

Well, that's great.

Too bad he doesn't exist.

<i>I believe in Santa Claus</i>

<i>Because he's true to me</i>

<i>There's no way</i>
<i>That reindeer and a sleigh</i>

<i>Can take a man on such a jolly spree</i>

<i>Stop right now</i>
<i>Let me show you how</i>

<i>He can do this all in one night</i>

<i>There's no way</i>
<i>It's impossible</i>

<i>The facts will never prove you right</i>

You know, Veronica,
thanks to the different time zones...

...if Santa travels east to west,
he buys himself approximately 31 hours...

...of Christmas Eve to work with,
not merely 12 as in your flawed critique.

Nice try, Trevor...

...but I'm afraid your numbers
are just like your name...

...mechanically correct,
but unsophisticated.

<i>These are all just silly words</i>

<i>I need to see some proof</i>

<i>Just close your eyes</i>

<i>And you will hear</i>

<i>The reindeer on the roof</i>

<i>There's no way</i>
<i>That this Santa Claus</i>

<i>Can do it all on Christmas Eve</i>

<i>Anything is possible</i>

<i>As long as we believe</i>

<i>The facts will never prove you right</i>

In fact, why am I even
having this discussion?

Errol, Gabriel,
you believe in Santa, right?

We avoid taking a
stance on such things.

In metaphysics,
one prefers to remain on the fence.

But you'll help me catch him?
Oh, baby, yeah.

Okay, guys, we've got work to do.

Our first order of business
is gathering data.

So where do we find the big guy?

Main generator's up.

Main generator's up.

Solar batteries and
borealis tranjector.

Solar batteries and
borealis tranjector.

Closing the doors.

Close hangar doors.

That's 10 seconds faster than last year,
sir.

<i>Stand down from drill.</i>

<i>Reindeer wranglers report to the barn.</i>

Good work, team.
You guys are the best.

Now, how about that coffee?

Your mocha-double-cappuccino-
yummalicious-delicious-yuletide decaf...

...shaken not stirred, sir?

<i>Two-one-three, report to main office.</i>

Soy milk? Who put soy milk in my...?

You know what the doctor says,
my little Santa Wanta.

Yes, dear.

<i>Elf 36, call your mother.</i>

Hand it over.
What are you getting at?

Come on.

And the other one.

<i>Beware of rabid reindeer.</i>

I've got my eye on you, Mr. Claus.

Back to work, everyone.
We're on a schedule here.

Okay, start loading the presents,
people. Stat.

Let's get going.
Yes, sir.

Ribbons and bows, come on.
Ribbons and bows!

Wrapping paper!

More presents!

Merry Christmas.

Is it 4:00 yet?
Three more hours, Frank.

Oh, boy.

Merry Christmas.

Merry, merry, merry Christmas.

And precisely what are we doing here,
Trevor?

Veronica doesn't believe in magic.
We'll use science to catch him.

First we'll need some real
evidence from our specimen.

Why don't we just spirit
the gentleman away right now?

First we have to confirm his identity.

You know, make sure he's the
real McCoy. Did you guys bring it?

Check. The X-ray 9,000.

It's never been tested outside the lab.
I hope he's got lead in his underwear.

Come on up here, young fella.

Now, what would you like
for Christmas this year?

Well, actually, just a few photos of you.
Well, of course.

Jill, take a picture.
That won't be necessary.

I brought my own photographers.

Hey, look, a rainbow.

DNA, check.

Visual reference...

...check.
Well...

...he has an enormous solid mass of
polyester padding in the thorax region.

And he's wearing a rudimentary beard
of some unknown fibrous origin.

Prepare yourself, Trevor.

That man in the town
square is not Santa Claus.

Well how do we find the real Santa?

Gentlemen, to the Internet.

Looking for Santa Claus, Kris Kringle.

Saint Nicholas.

Father Christmas.
Cinder Claus.

Papa Noël.
Père Noël.

Veronica?
Veronica?

Who calls him that?

Have you been there all along?

Come on, guys,
you're wasting your time.

It's Christmas Eve.
Let's go do something fun.

Okay, okay, for the sake of argument...

...what if I can see that
perhaps Santa maybe exists...

...in some kind of parallel,
alternate universe kind of thing?

You're saying he lives
on another planet?

No, I think she's saying
he has a time machine.

No, no, no. I was just kidding.

Look, I'm just trying to help
you see that you're acting crazy.

All right, Veronica, you're really
starting to rain on our parade.

But you sound ridiculous.

Do you guys even have a plan?

Okay, good question.

Which one of you two
has been keeping notes?

Well, we have a route, a velocity...

...and a fair guesstimate
of what time he'll be overhead.

With a slight margin of error.
About the size of Texas.

That's not a plan.

It's not even an idea.

It's just a bunch of words strung
together trying to sound scientific.

Maybe,
but I'm gonna catch Santa Claus...

...and that will be all the
scientific proof you need.

<i>Trevor, quick.</i>
<i>Come up to the observatory right away.</i>

You know it's Christmas Eve, right?

New Year's Eve is still a week away.
Oh, yes, dear, of course.

We're celebrating because we just
spotted a very rare and unusual comet.

It's called Lefreeze,
just a big ball of ice really.

And it drifts close to Earth's
orbit only once every 100 years.

Right around Christmas time.

Wow, congratulations, Dr. Taylor.
What are you doing to celebrate?

Well, it is Christmas, you know,
and we're having dinner with grandma...

...which reminds me,
are you coming, Trevor?

Yeah.

But we've kind of got that
holiday book report to do.

A book report on Christmas Eve?
Yeah.

It sort of came up at the last minute.

Right, Errol?

Sure, whatever you say, sir.

Okay, Trevor, you can join us later.

There's a casserole in the fridge
in case you kids get hungry.

All right,
we'll make this our control center.

You're incorrigible, you know?
That's what you like about me.

So that's Lefreeze, huh?

My back.

How long have I been asleep?
A hundred years, Mr. Lefreeze, sir.

Thanks for waiting.
Did I miss anything?

Boss, you live in a comet.

What's there to miss?

Okay, then.

What's on our agenda?

Well, we were thinking
of taking over a planet.

You know, subjugating a solar system.
Oh, no, no. I'm not in the mood.

Not in the mood. What else you got?
Well, it's Christmas time, sir.

Christmas time?

You know what that means.

Time to put on snow tires?
Time to wear long underwear.

You know, sometimes I can't believe
we came out of the same snow drift.

It's time to catch Santy Claus.
Bingo.

And this time,
we're gonna get him, too.

This might sound like a stupid question,
fellas.

Then don't ask it.

What do you got against Santa Claus?

Have I not explained
this to youse before?

Well, l... Maybe I wasn't in the room.

Oh, fantastic. You made him sing.

<i>Santa never paid me no mind</i>

<i>Santa never was jolly and kind</i>

<i>Santa never would give me his time</i>

<i>Now I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

<i>Santa never had nothing for me</i>

<i>Santa never could hear my plea</i>

<i>And, Santa, I demand your apology</i>

<i>Because I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

One!

I do not like those big, red,
baggy pants, Santa.

Two!
What are you always doing hanging...

...around the mall?
Three!

You know, if I snuck into someone's
house in the middle of the night...

Four!
...they'd lock me up.

And what's up with the cookies?
Five, six, seven, eight!

<i>Santa, I've got a beef with you</i>

<i>Santa, I think you know it too</i>

<i>Santa, get ready to be Santa who</i>

<i>Because I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

One!
Oh, Santa.

Two!
I'm gonna get you.

Three!
Oh, I'm coming for you.

Four!
Yes, sirree.

<i>Because I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

<i>He's got a list</i>
<i>A list of his own</i>

<i>Because I've got a list</i>

<i>He's got a list</i>

<i>Oh, I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my</i>

<i>We've got to catch him</i>
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

<i>Own</i>

Bring up the reindeer!

Bringing up the reindeer!

Reindeer on deck!

Commence Christmas protocol.

Commencing Christmas protocol.

More presents.
Here's another load!

A dozen more pink ones. Stat!
Bring it up!

Back it up.

Too far. Keep them coming.

Easy does it. Easy, easy, easy.

Oh, right there. Nice one, Charlie.

All done.

That's the last one.
Everyone stand clear.

<i>Prepare to deck the halls.</i>
<i>Deck them, dude.</i>

Ready for your inspection, sir.

Toys?

Check.
Carriage for the reindeers?

Check. And, don't worry, Santa,
I've got your donuts on the list.

Our little secret.

Speaking of which, where is that list?

May I have a word, Santa, dear?

Anything for you, darling.

Do you remember what year it is?

My, my, my.

Has it been 100 years already?
Where does the time go?

And speaking of which...

...it's time to be going.

Lefreeze nearly caught you last time.
What if he tries again this year?

I know how to deal with him.

Maybe you should stay home this year.

We can send out gift certificates.

And I hear the South Pole's
very nice this time of year.

Hey, I'm Santa Claus.
What could go wrong?

Too obvious.

Too primitive.

Not bad.

It has potential.

You've become obsessed with this.
No, I haven't.

Oh, maybe we should try lining
the chimney with superglue.

Come on, Trev.
You don't have to do this for me.

Oh, this isn't just for you.
No, no, no.

I'm doing it for the whole world,
for all the Veronicas out there.

I, Trevor Taylor the second...

...will finally answer one
of life's greatest questions...

...solve one of its enduring mysteries.

I will prove for once and
all that Santa is real.

And then I'm gonna
throw a press conference.

Okay, maybe I'm a little bit obsessed.

You're off the charts, Trevor.
You guys are pathetic.

You know she's right.
We are pathetic.

Point of order, exactly
how do we plan on catching him?

Join me upstairs, gentlemen, and lady.

All will be revealed.

It's perfect.

It can't miss. I present to you
the space traction laser beam.

One zap will pull his
sleigh gently down to Earth.

The rest is history.

Bravo.
Yes.

As you can see,
I've got the sighting component here.

Now, if I could just get my hands on a...

How do I put this?

High-powered laser?
Well, why didn't you say so?

You can borrow our
parents' industrial model.

Yes, they keep it in the garage
still in the original packaging.

Why do your parents
have an industrial power laser?

It just happened to
be on sale at the time.

Half-price. They couldn't resist.

Well, there you have it then.
We're set to go.

You know, Trevor, I was just thinking...
Yes?

I really appreciate
what you're doing here...

...but you and I both know
you're not gonna catch him.

And I don't want to be responsible
for shattering your dream.

See, that is exactly why I have to do it,
Veronica.

If this is the only way I
can prove to you he exists...

<i>A blip in the sky</i>
<i>A jolly red guy</i>

<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

<i>He's on his way</i>
<i>Got the super cool sleigh</i>

<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

<i>Where did he go?</i>

<i>We've got to catch him because</i>

<i>We need some proof</i>
<i>He's up on the roof</i>

<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

<i>We've got to catch him because</i>

<i>The schedule is tight</i>
<i>There's only one night</i>

<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

<i>He's fixing to leave</i>
<i>On Christmas Eve</i>

<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

<i>You know we've got to be quick</i>
<i>To catch Saint Nick</i>

<i>We've got to catch him because</i>

<i>We need some proof</i>

<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

Okay, so let's go through this again.

You aim with this.

You shoot with that.

And then, you use this other
thing to reel him back in.

It's just like fishing, boss.
Fishing for Santa Claus.

But what do we use as bait?
That's the beauty of it, boss.

This thing don't need bait.
Nice, I get it.

No. Actually, I don't.
Can we go through this again?

You guys was going kind of fast.

Begin Christmas countdown.

Beginning Christmas countdown.
<i>- Begin Christmas countdown.</i>

December 24 time-zone itinerary
adjusted for International Date Line.

Sunset, umbra and moon shadow.

Setting continuum clock.

Synchronize now.

<i>Attention, attention. Clear hangar deck.</i>

Shotgun.

Real funny, kid.
You ride with the reindeer kibble.

Make me proud, Santa.

All right, everybody! To your stations!
Let's go!

<i>Open hangar doors.</i>

Yogurt.
<i>- Pardon all electronics.</i>

<i>Prepare for borealis effect.</i>

<i>- Five.</i>
All set back there, Barky?

<i>- Four.</i>
Not really, sir.

Somebody left an old
present under the seat.

Look's like it's been here forever.

Let me see that. I remember this one.
<i>- Two.</i>

<i>- One.</i>
Okay, let's do this.

The Armor Smata 2,000.

The sturdiest containment
unit money can buy.

I'm setting it, appropriately enough,
for a 300-pound gorilla.

You're right,
should probably make it 350.

Almost forgot,
the most important ingredient...

...the cookies and milk for the bait.

The guy keeps a tight schedule.

He should be overhead
in approximately 14 seconds.

Team two, do you copy?

Team two, copy.

<i>How are you doing</i>
<i>with that tracking system?</i>

I just got a visual...

...and I have a lock.

There's something we forgot
to tell you about that laser.

Yeah?

It was originally built
for missile defense.

It may have a little more
kick than anticipated.

There he is. Right on time.

So predictable.

Merry Christmas, Santa Claus.

Get ready, Veronica,
because here comes your proof.

Fire.

We've been hit!

Santa!
What?

Where'd he go?

He's getting away!

Mayday, mayday, this is Pole Force 1.
Big Red overboard.

Repeat, Big Red overboard.

Good job, trainee.

Put on the brakes, number 1.

We've got to land this baby
by the seat of our pantaloons.

Your coldness, sir.
What?

It looks like somebody
else shot him first.

With a laser of industrial strength.
A laser?

Now, that's clever.
Yeah, clever.

I do not believe this.

Who uses lasers these days?

Looks like he's crashing
into some small town.

And that means he's grounded.

He can't fly away.
He's off the sleigh.

Perfect. Well, what are we waiting for?

Team two to base.
Santa rooftop contact confirmed.

Oh, my.

Santa 's on the roof.
I can't believe it.

It's a raccoon.

I knew karate lessons would
prove to be a sound investment.

Let's get him.

And I had to eat those donuts.

Well, would you look at that?
There's cookies in that basement.

On your left.

Got you.

Did you get him?

I got you.

We'll reconnoiter and report
after applying first aid.

Stop moving. Hey.

Errol's got him.

I've got you now, Santa.
No, you don't, Gabriel.

It's me, your own brother.

Well, how am I supposed to know that
in the dark with a Santa on your head?

This is becoming extremely tiresome.
Please take it off at once.

Don't pull my head off.

Santa.

Come out, come out, wherever you are.
He's got to be around here somewhere.

I keep telling you.
It was just a raccoon on the roof.

Oh, Veronica, ye of little faith.

Excuse me.

Help, help, help.

It's stuck.

Hold on.

Errol, stop moving.

I got nothing.

Santa?

Where am I?

My head.

I actually did it? I caught Santa Claus.
Right. It sure looks that way.

Where am I? What's going on here?

Santa Stopper 3, do you copy?

Santa Stopper 2?

Oh, I gotta go get the guys.

I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

Ronnie, whatever you do,
don't let him out.

At least not until after
the press conference.

Then we'll show the world that the
magic of Santa Claus really does exist.

Whatever.

I have to admit,
you're the best Santa I've seen yet.

Trevor's clearly gone to a lot of trouble.

Is this real?

Look, pal,
I don't know what he's paying you...

...but it will take more
convincing than this.

You may as well pack up now.

What are you talking about?

You and I both know Trevor
paid you to come here.

How much?
Trevor? Trevor Taylor?

Is he responsible for this?

Now I get it.

You can tell him,
"Nice try, but no cigar."

Tell him I do not,
and never will, believe in Santa.

End of story, done.

You used to believe in me,
Miss Veronica Jean Campbell.

So he told you my name, huh?
Veronica.

Could he have told me about
a certain Christmas present...

...that a certain girl always wanted...

...but was too embarrassed
to tell anyone about?

What?
Here it is, Veronica.

A Cuddles, the rainbow-haired, limited
edition magic light-up sparkle wand?

Merry Christmas.
How did you...?

But... Oh, my.

You are Santa Claus, aren't you?

You're real!

Santa Claus is real?
I had no idea.

Be quiet, will you?
Sorry, Mr. Claus, sir.

Mr. Claus is my father.
Call me Santa.

And now that we've got
that out of the way...

...could you please
get me out of here?

I'm kind of on a tight schedule.
Anything you say, Santa, sir.

Sorry I didn't believe in you.

Forget about it. It goes with the job.
Yes, sir.

You can pull that rope over there.

You know, about trapping you like this...

...I just want to say,
I had nothing to do with it.

And he looks just like in the movies.

Ronnie, don't!

You said you wouldn't let him out.
Yeah, when I thought he was a fake.

Hey.

Where'd he go?

What did you do with him, Ronnie?
Me?

Nothing.
He must have gone out the window.

Spread out. We got to find him.

You stay here, in case he comes back.
Oh, no. I'm going with you.

To Woody, the lumberjack.

Thank you Woodrow.

You did what you set out to do, Trev.
Now let him go.

No, no, I still need to call the press.

We need to tell people
the truth once and for all.

He's not getting away.
Are you crazy?

Santa's got deliveries to make,
a schedule to keep.

What happened to you?

Look, let's just say that maybe,
just maybe, you were right.

Keep talking.
What? Do I have to apologize?

Look, can't we just let him go?

Are you trying to help Santa get away?
Again?

Now that he's real,
that changes everything.

I think I heard something
inside the shed.

I'll check it out.

Santa?

Is that you?

Are you in here?

Trevor. What's going on?

Sorry, Ronnie,
but I'm doing this for your own good.

You're gonna interfere
with the rest of the mission.

Open this door, Trevor.
Soon as my mission is complete.

You have my word as a friend.

No, right now.

I can't trust you to follow orders,
and this is bigger than the both of us.

Oh, I'm gonna get you for this.
You.

You put me behind schedule.

Santa, I know you're upset.

I didn't mean for it to go down like this.

Get him.

Look, I'm a busy guy.
Let him go.

Please, Santa.

All I wanted was to show
everyone that you exist.

You know, for real life.

It'll only take a few minutes.
Do you know what you've done?

I have to clear Greenland
before the sun comes up.

Mr. Claus, all I'm asking for
is a teeny little press conference.

How about we settle for a photograph?

I don't feel so good.

What is that?
Trevor, my boy.

I think you've now become
the least of my problems.

Okay, you kids, stay close to me.
Things are about to get a little chilly.

This would've been a good
year for gift certificates.

Bedford Falls, Welton Mountain...

...Avenly, Meisterburger Village?

We're miles off course.
We're lucky to be alive, trainee.

We're off schedule,
stuck in the middle of nowhere...

...and we've lost our captain.

Saddle up, trainee, this has
just turned into a rescue mission.

Earth.

I haven't been here for a while.

It hasn't changed much.

Now, where is he?

He could be anywhere, boss.
Look at this place.

Is it warm down here, or is it just me?

It is a little balmy.

I think it's time to get a
little more comfortable. Boys.

Santa, I've had just about
enough of your nonsense.

Now, let me just count the ways.

Five, six, seven, eight!

<i>Santa, I've got a beef with you</i>

<i>Santa, I think you know it too</i>

<i>And, Santa, get ready to be Santa who</i>

<i>Because I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

One!
Big red baggy pants.

Two!
Little elves that dance.

Three!
That silly, white beard.

Four!
Hey, you're pretty weird.

Five!
The mall.

Six!
You've got a lot of gall.

Seven!
And all those snacks.

Eight!
You better watch your back.

<i>Because I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my own</i>

<i>He's got a list</i>
<i>A list of his own</i>

<i>Because I've got a list</i>

<i>He's got a list</i>

<i>Oh, I've got a list</i>
<i>A list of my</i>

<i>We've got to catch him</i>
<i>We've got to catch Santa Claus</i>

<i>Own</i>

You know that guy?
He's an old acquaintance...

...by the name of Lefreeze.
As in the Lefreeze comet...

...my parents told us about?
He just froze half our town.

I've never seen so much ice.

Hence the name.
What does he have against you?

Besides that list, of course.

Oh, it's a long story...

...but he's not looking to exchange
Christmas cards, I can assure you.

He doesn't look very friendly.
He's all bark and no bite.

Is there another way
around the square?

Yeah, but, they're in the way.

Looks like my crew will have
to pick me up here, then.

Good thing I've got a
tracking device on the sleigh.

Can we get a picture of that too?

Darn.

Help! Let me out!

Somebody? Anybody?

Hey, wait a minute.

Magic, huh?
All right, it's worth a try.

Open sesame.

Hey, what do you know?

Maybe there is
something to this magic.

Santa, up here!
Catch the rope!

Well, that's my ride.
Thank goodness.

Wait a sec. What about my picture?

I'm very sorry,
but I've got a big night ahead of me.

Adiós and adieu.

Climb the rope. You can make it.

That's it, keep coming.

I had to eat those donuts.

Keep climbing, Santa.
Come on, Santa.

Don't stop.
Guys:

I can't believe it. There he is.

Oh, yes, and bull's-eye.
Yeah!

Nice shot, boss.

Santa, are you okay?
I like cocoa better than eggnog.

Maybe you should just rest a bit.

Hey, boss, he went down over there.
Yeah, let's go get him.

Wait a minute.
Something's not right here.

I don't know about those children.

Yeah, boss,
but they're just a bunch of kids.

Yeah, just little kids, like mini-crackers.

They shot him out of
the sky with a laser.

Who knows what they could do to us.

Let me handle this.

Nice job getting Santa Claus, children.

We'd like to commend you.

We've been trying for hundreds of years,
and you...

You pulled it off in one night.
Congratulations.

Now hand him over.
Go away!

He's ours!
We caught him fair and square.

All right, then, you leave me no choice...

...but to bombard you
with these balls of snow.

Did he just hit me with a snowball?

You call that a snowball?
Here's a snowball.

Are you gonna help me or not here?
Right away, sir.

Yeah, they're just a bunch of kids.

Take that!
Yeah, hey, try this on for size.

Hand him over.

I don't think you're getting the hint here.

I came here for Santa. He's mine.

No, he's mine.
Mine!

Mine!
Mine!

I caught him first.
I'm bigger than you.

And uglier.
Well, there's no need...

...to make this personal. Spread out.

See if you can find any more of them.
I got things under control here.

Look at all the snow.

Don't think we're gonna have
another green Christmas this year.

Gotcha!

What on Earth is going on here?

Wouldn't you like to know, sweetheart?

Hey! Hey, get away from me.

Back off, you overgrown snow cones.

Hey, my mother was a snow cone.
That's right, she was.

Now, you're coming with us.

Help!

Hey, listen.
What?

It's quiet.
Maybe they've given up.

Not likely. What's he up to?

Drop your snowballs.

I think we have something
you might be interested in.

Let her go right now.
I'll trade you, her for him.

This has gone far enough.
Now, let her go.

Santa.
Okay, Freeze.

That's Lefreeze to you.
Lefreeze, I'm sorry.

No, you're not.
You've never been sorry, but you will be.

Come on.

This isn't really about me.

So how about we settle
this once and for all?

Yeah.

The time has come.

I know what you've wanted
from me all these years.

I stashed it here a while back.

Yeah, yeah, here it is, a little dusty.

Good thing I didn't let Barky
clean out the back seat.

This is for you, Lefreeze.
Merry Christmas.

Back it up, Red. You think you
can buy him off with a present?

You think a knickknack
is enough to make him go away?

You think...

Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What kind of self-respecting
ice monster do you think...?

Quiet, all of you.

Maybe Lefreeze always wanted
a gift from Santa Claus.

Maybe Lefreeze was
hurt he never got one.

Boss, are you telling me
that's what this is all about?

One undelivered Christmas present?

You're a villain. Start acting like one.

Yeah, what about that list?

Yeah, the list. And your
unquenchable thirst for revenge?

Okay, yeah, that list is all true,
but I mean, what is true anyway?

What I think is true,
scientifically speaking to you...

...I mean, may not be exactly true to me,
if you want to get all legal about it.

Look, the honest side of it is, there's
really only one item on that list, okay?

There, I said it.

Jeez, I don't know about you guys,
but I'm feeling kind of used.

Yeah, oh, brother.

The whole thing is completely
embarrassing to be honest.

Oh, come on.

All right, open it.
Whatever.

Yeah, take it.
I'm sick about the whole thing.

Can't even look at you anymore.
Do you want this present or not?

Golly, you shouldn't have.
Can I open it now?

Well, it is Christmas.

Yeah!

It's just what I always wanted.

I'm gonna call him Teddy.

Well, this story has
taken an absurd turn.

Oh, this is nothing.

I think I've got a little
something for you three as well.

You can't buy us.
Who do you think we are?

What do you got?
Let me see here.

I'm sure my reindeer won't miss these.

A real carrot.

You know what? I can finally breathe.
Gosh, Santa, a carrot.

I don't know what to say here.

Let me see if I can help you.

Thank you, Santa.
We're really sorry about all this.

So no hard feelings, right?
Of course not.

'Tis the season to be jolly.

I guess we've caused enough damage.

Maybe we should just get going.

Are you coming, Teddy?
Now, stay close to me.

It's gonna be cold.
Goodbye, Santa.

No hard feelings, huh, kids?

If there's, you know, anything we can do,
just let us know.

I think you've done enough.
Now, run along.

Gee, thanks, Santa.

I hope to see you next year.

He just needed a little attention, Barky.
Get those reindeer in gear.

Aye-aye, captain.

Hey, Santa, I'm sorry for knocking you
out of the sky and everything.

I guess I got carried away.
Forget about it.

The main thing is that you helped me
patch things up with Lefreeze.

And I'd rather be shot
down by you than by him.

Well, it was an honor to meet you, sir.

A privilege, indeed.

Sir, are you gonna put us on your
naughty list because of what happened?

We'll just see how you
guys do this coming year.

And you, Veronica Jean Campbell.
Yes, sir?

Science has its place,
but so does magic.

It's just the way it is.

Thank you, Santa.
So you don't need me to stick around...

...for a press conference, right?
I think we're satisfied that you're real.

We're all set over here.
Ready when you are, sir.

But how about that picture?
Okay, just one.

Say chess.
Chess!

And now, we'd best be on our way.

We'll have to hurry if we're gonna
get everything delivered in time.

Oh, Santa, is there
anything we can do to help?

Well, actually, there is.
May I borrow your wand?

Of course.
This thing just might save me tonight.

Go, Santa, go.

Oh, by the way, I think Trevor likes you,
but what do I know?

I'm just Santa Claus.

This ought to speed things up.

Wow, that wand really
turns up the speed.

All right, gang, let's shake a hoof.

Thanks for everything, Santa.

Happy Christmas to all,
and to all a good night!

We had better return
that laser tout de suite.

What's the rush?

We're already grounded for life.

I thought you really wanted that wand.

Yeah, I did,
but Christmas is about giving.

Yeah.

Sorry I locked you up.
It's okay.

It all worked out in the end.

So, Miss Logical Science Brain, are you
ready to admit that I was right all along?

I thought I did.

Let me hear it just one more time.

You still have to prove to me
this all really happened.

This could all be a dream,
in which case, it's been a good one.

Hey, you can't do that.
Just did.

Wait up!

Trevor.

Wake up, Mr. Sleepyhead.
It's Christmas morning.

We were expecting to see you
at Grandma's last night.

What happened?
Mom, Dad, you'll never believe it.

That comet you spotted, Lefreeze...

...there's this ice monster who lives on it,
see, and he hates Santa Claus.

Least he used to.
He came here to get him...

Sounds like one nifty dream, son.

I know what it sounds like,
but it actually happened.

Look, I'll prove it.

Oh, no, my camera. What happened?

Oh, the camera must've broke when
we were having that snowball fight.

Maybe it was just a dream.

Well, whatever it was, if you want proof
Santa exists, just look under the tree.

From Santa, son.

Oh, cool. A chess set, yeah.

Oh, it's just what I asked him for.

Well, not exactly what I asked him for.

This is way better.

<i>Santa has returned.</i>
<i>Santa has returned.</i>

<i>Santa, come on down.</i>

Honey, I'm home.

How was work, big boy?

Oh, boy.
So did you run into Lefreeze?

More like he ran into me.

Oh, you just need a good night's sleep,
dear.

I think I need x-rays.

It went that well, huh?

Let's just say last night gets an
entire chapter in my autobiography.

So where can a guy find
a sandwich around here?

No, thanks.

You're a good Santa.

So there you have it. Crazy, huh?

Told you this holiday special
would be a little different.

Sure, me and my friends
sang a couple songs...

...hung out with Santa Claus...

...saved Christmas
from a crazy giant ice monster.

That's all part of the genre.

No, the thing you've got
to give us credit for...

...is the simple fact that we shot
Santa out of the sky with a laser.

Correct me if I'm wrong...

...but I don't think anyone's ever
done that in a holiday special before.

Ask me why I did it.

Go on, ask.

No, it wasn't to make Veronica kiss me.

<i>Hey.</i>

Although that wasn't so bad.

This was about doing what
every kid has wanted to do...

...since the beginning of time.

I proved once and for all that Santa
is real, and I did it with science.

<i>Visual reference.</i>

I'm sure there are skeptics out there
who will say it was all just a dream.

I have only one thing to say to you,
skeptics:

Merry Christmas!

I mean, what else can
you say to a skeptic?

The bottom line is that if you
don't believe I caught Santa...

...my guess is you didn't buy
into this part either.

Do you want this present or not?

Yeah!

And if that's not your cup of tea,
then what can I say?

To each his own. It's the holidays.

Let's all be nice to one another, okay?

Okay, okay.

So I'm gonna just sort of look at his lines
so I can get a better feel to mine.

I'm sorry to hit that mic,
but that's the way it is.

So we're seeing the bags
and things are struggling...

...and I presume the chainsaw
comes out through the bag.

Right? Okay.

Okay, rolling?

<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

That's the way it goes, right?
Okay, right. Wait a minute.

I was hiding in my bag
and got the chainsaw.

Right, I'm breaking out of the bag
with the chainsaw.

Okay. Right.

I'm coming on like
the <i>Chainsaw Massacre.</i>

Is that correct?

Okay.

Is that free? Is that available?

Okay, okay, right.

Yes, yeah, yeah. Right, got it.

Okay, good.

Okay.

<i>Deck the halls with boughs of hol...</i>

<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

<i>Deck the halls with boughs...</i>

<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

<i>Deck the halls with bou...</i>

<i>Deck the malls...</i>

<i>Teck the balls with...</i>
<i>With bolly holly</i>

<i>Deck the halls...</i>

I got it.

<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

<i>Deck the boughs with halls...</i>

With what?

Boughs. Deck the halls with boughs of...

Of folly.

<i>Deck the boughs of...</i>

<i>With halls of...</i>
<i>With boughs of holly</i>

<i>Deck the boughs with hall...</i>
<i>With...</i>

<i>Deck the boughs with...</i>

Deck the halls with boughs of holly.

Right, okay. Yeah.

Yeah.

I think balls...

Halls of...

Boughs of...

Halls with boughs of holly,
I think is funnier.

And... which we can use.

Let me do some more... like I'm chasing.

Are you rolling?

As I'm chasing?

Should we...? You want the other one?

<i>Deck</i>
<i>Deck</i>

<i>Deck</i>

<i>The halls with boughs of holly</i>

Okay, you happy?

Well, that doesn't work now, does it?

Let me do... again.

About for 3:37.

Yeah, yeah.

I'm moving on?

Okay.

In that case, let's move on.

Yes?

Is somebody coming with my coffee?
