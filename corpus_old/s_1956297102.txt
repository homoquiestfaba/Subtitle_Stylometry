Maybe not all animals, but monkeys.

It comes from them.

Do you think a monkey can get AIDS today?

If you treat a monkey in
a zoo or African reserve,

are you as careful as a doctor
doing normal surgery?

No clue. Why are you thinking about this shit?
<i>Take a guy who wants to fuck a monkey.</i>

The theory is AIDS started that way. If
a guy wants to fuck a monkey today,

<i>should he use a condom?</i>

I'm eating, man! Don't talk
about fucking monkeys.

<i>Did wolves raise you?</i>

<i>What do I care?</i>

Cuz I fuck monkeys or have AIDS?

What the fuck.

OK, sorry. It was a valid question.

They only ate monkeys. The rest was made up.

Who'd be so sick he'd rape an animal?
Lots of people.

Legally, I'm not sure "monkey rape" exists.
Sure it does. Animals have rights.

The monkey won't turn anorexic and
see a therapist. It's not the same.

Monkeys are self-aware.

<i>They see themselves, in a mirror, right?</i>

I bet a raped monkey suffers like a woman.
<i><font color=#FF551>- GIRL:</font> So a raped woman,</i>

The test was totally unrelated.

She said the interns sent her ward to ward,

saying they couldn't jab her
due to the fat on her arms.

They said to lose weight and come back.

Can you imagine? Nonsense. I'd
had no trouble finding a vein.

Why didn't she report it?

bother anyone, I guess.

Off to get deflowered at your prom?

I'm off.

<i><font color=#FF551>- JUSTINE AND ALEXIA:</font> Where to?</i>
Hospital party. It's hardcore.

They party on call and barf if someone comes in.

They treat the guy, then go back.

Luckily, you had nothing to sew
back on. It'd be on backwards.

I'm so lucky.

Hands off.

I thought he was gay.

You want to play?

Yeah.

Did you lose weight?

My dress fits you better. It's less slutty.

Thank you.

It's not a compliment. You better
not be anorexic. It's gross.

I'm not sick.

You will be if you keep it up. I know
what happens. You won't hold up.

I'm not you. Do your thing. I don't need that.
Really.

No. I just tried it.

You couldn't try something other than my finger?

Nothing else on the menu looked good?

Was it good at least?

You taste like curry.

What?

<font color=#ff00ff>[SIGHS]</font>

When she was born, she was our little princess.

We took her everywhere.

Our friends loved her.

She was full tilt from the start.

She should have studied politics
or something. <font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font>

So, I guess she got used to being...

herself.

It's our fault. We didn't find a solution.

<i>What do you mean?</i>

Your mom was tough at first. Kept saying I was
her best friend at school. It drove me nuts.

It's not like she had a boyfriend. Just me.

And then we had our first
kiss. And I understood.

<font color=#ff00ff>[GASPS, SNIFFLES]</font>

I'm sure you'll find a solution, honey.
