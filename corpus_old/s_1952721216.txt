{Men shouting
in Asian language}

{Speaking Asian language}

{Dog barking in distance}

{Men speaking Asian language}

{All shouting}

{Screaming}

Ah!

Go!

I would hazard our friends,

the Hong merchants,

are prospering under
your able governorship,

my friend?

They grow rich and
show their appreciation.

But there is one last fly
that buzzes around my face.

Reverend Elders
grows too bold.

He'll be dealt with before
the next shipment arrives.

{Door opening}

Ah!

Oh, the lovely Priscilla!

Forgive the intrusion, Father.
I just wanted

to bid you goodnight.

That's my girl.
Now to bed.

The Governor and I have
dreary business to discuss.

Goodnight.

Sleep well, my darling.

Dream beautiful dreams.

{Speaking Asian language}

Ah, Reverend Elders!

Speak of the devil.

Your Lordship.

I must appeal to you.
This must stop.

Smuggling opium,

kidnapping villagers for
transport to forced labour...

We're doing nothing wrong.

In fact, under the Treaty of
Lorcha, it's entirely legal.

I know you're selling
British Army rifles

to the Hong merchants.

Now, that is a serious charge.

My only consolation

is the knowledge that
tonight's opium shipment

lies at the bottom
of the harbour.

He is setting up

his own private army.

A detail we don't need public.

I shall see to it

that every MP
and every newspaper

here and in England

knows the true story.

I'm afraid you won't,
Reverend.

We can't have Heaven interfering

with our earthly plans.

Business will go on.

You, unfortunately,

will not.

{Grunting}

Wait.

{Groaning}

Before you die,

let me assure you

that I am not without feeling.

I would not send you
from this world alone.

Your son...

will follow you tonight.

{Grunting}

{Knife dropping}

This is the third such
ambush in as many months.

Opium is the currency
of our business,

and I will tolerate no more
meddling in my affairs.

{Jonathan speaking
Asian language}

{Speaking Asian language}

{Banging on door}

Come here.

Chu-Shu, keep an eye on him.

{Banging continues}

Chu-Shu, go and get Chen.
Quickly!

There, quickly.

What's happening?
{Glass shattering}

Stay here no matter what.
Promise?

Promise.

{Crashing}

{Dog barking}

The boy, where is he?

He isn't here.
He's staying with a friend.

{Banging}

You think you can fool me,
woman?

I'll ask you once more.

Where's the boy?

He's away.

Where's the boy? Speak!

He's away!

{Grunting}

{Ding screaming}

{Gasping}

Tell me!
Where is he?

Ah! You have spirit.

It will be useful
in the next world!

{Ding screaming}

{Knocking on door}

Who's there?

{Asian language}

{Panting}

{Speaking Asian language}

Come! Governor Fung
will want to hear of this.

{Both speaking
Asian language}

{Man shouting
in Asian language}

{Horse carriage arriving}

Throw him with the others.

{Crying}

{Door opening}

It's me they wanted!

I should have done something.

There was nothing
you could do.

Now come.
We cannot stay here.

Father! Where is Father?

They are going to pay
for this!

They must have found
out about Elders!

We have to get his son
far away as possible!

Lindsey is too well-connected.

There is nowhere
the child can hide, not safely.

Then what are we
to do with him?

We'll take him
to Xidong Village.

Uncle Pei will know what to do.

{Rooster crowing}

{Birds chirping}

{Men speaking Asian language}

Where am I?

{Speaking Asian language}

{Mai}: Grey one?

Wort whistle.

Pink one?

Belladonna.

Black one?

Cloud Shade.
Yay!

{Both speaking Asian language}

Good, good, good.

If Chen wishes this,

then I will certainly do it.

I think Chen completely wrong.

Let the foreigners
kill each other!

It will save us the trouble.

Tell him
that I will do as he wishes.

You look like a cross between
a peacock and a swan.

What am I to call you?

My name is Jonathan.

Terrible things happened.

And I don't know
what happened to my father.

Your father is dead.

I'm sorry.

First, you mourn.

Then we'll see...

what place
we can find for you...

in this world.

{Crow cawing}

That is your job, not mine.

I too busy!
To fit in, you have to do a lot!

No.

Did you say no?

Hey, cut it out!

Yeah? Why should I?

{Grunting}

{Grunting}

Hmm!

You are a disgrace
to our village!

Go play with your foreign devil!

Are you all right?
I'm fine.

What was that?
It was incredible.

It's called Wushu;

it's a martial art.

How do you know English?
Uncle Pei teaches us.

He says the way to know
how your enemy thinks

is to learn the way they speak.

Why didn't anyone
tell me before?

You're still an outsider here.

You don't fit in.

{Instructor shouting
in Asian language}

{Continues shouting
in Asian language}

I don't think you are here
for an English lesson.

I want to learn Wushu.

You think...

you can master the art of ages?

Yes. I'll give you
everything I have.

We have never shared our
ways with a foreigner before.

But I will teach you.

Within you, there is a dragon.

Come.

Try and hit me.

You must learn to do what I ask,

without questions.

{Grunting softly}

Try.

Put something into it!

{Yelling}

But there is one condition.

Anything.

This must be our secret.

Tell no one what we are doing.

{Both grunting}

{Grunting}

You are doing well...

for a foreigner.

{Grunting}

{Screaming}

Ah!
{Panting}

I see Uncle Pei has been
teaching you some tricks.

He knows many things
besides English.

I never thought
I would see this.

It's nice.

{Grunting}

Never assume you have
the upper hand, my darling.

Yes, Pa.

Mistress, your plant-studies
instructor is waiting.

Off you go.

Of course, Papa.

You must empty yourself,

become one with everything.

I'm trying.

That's your trouble.

You must let the dragon be you.

Wushu is a meditation.

It's not made
for hate or revenge.

They killed
my father and Ding.

You must let it go.

The past is the past.

Seek inside,

and never let your feelings
rule your actions, ever!

Our little lost English boy

has become a strong young man.

But he's half of what
he was meant to be.

Wushu is for the Chinese.

It can never be
understood by outsiders.

Leave us, young friend.

We have business to discuss.

The Hong merchants
are gathering.

The shipment must have arrived.

The roads are all watched.
How could it happen?

The English know many tactics.

They surely know just
what strings to pull on.

We have to find out

where they are
taking the opium.

I can get
the information for you.

For once,
being a foreigner is good.

I can move through the
British concession unnoticed.

This is my fight, too.

Perhaps it is time.

{Speaking Asian language}

I am honoured you have
interest in my store.

These are the things I need.

These creatures
only love their weakness.

Where do they go?

What do they see?

They drift

where their thoughts lead them.

But their dreams are empty.

You must always be strong.

There is no place in your
life for such empty dreams.

{Speaking Asian language}

{Shouting}

{Grunting}

{Man groaning}

Witchcraft and sorcery
are fine,

but they have
their limitations.

There is more to it than that.

The only limitations
are knowledge

and one's willingness to use it.

Your knowledge
wasn't very useful in there.

{Dog barking}

As you know, each of
you has been handpicked

and given provinces to control

by my good friend the Governor.

We've given you
an endless supply of opium

and addicts to consume it.

We've given you the right
to enslave your people

and send them to work on
plantations around the empire.

You, the Hong merchants,

have been well rewarded
for your efforts.

Our gratitude is yours,
and our special thanks.

We need more,

50,000 more slaves,

for our western
estates and plantations.

That can't be done!
Which is why

we are increasing your quota

of opium distribution.

Hey! You!

What are you doing?
Jonathan!

Jonathan!

{Horse neighing}

{Grunting}
Cha! Cha!

{Grunting}

Jonathan! Hurry up!
Cha! Cha!

Cha! Cha!
We gotta go!

This is for my father!

{Shouting}

Cha! Cha!
Cha! Cha!

Jonathan, let's go!

Jonathan.

Jonathan!

Hey!

Cha! Cha!
Cha! Cha!

Look out!

After them!
Move, you fools!

{Screaming}

Hey!

Stop!

Hey!

Cha! Cha!

Ah!
I had him!

He was right there!

Don't worry!
There'll be another chance.

Idiots!

{Screaming}

Who the hell is she?

It's Lindsey's daughter!
What do we do with her?

Throw her
in the devil's water!

{Screaming}

Close it!

I want every soldier
in Shanghai looking for her.

Immediately, sir.

I also want a reward posted

for information leading
to her release.

God gave you legs
to carry out my wishes.

If they don't move
in the next 5 seconds...

I'll have them cut off.

We're here, miss.

It would be good
if you got off now.

Otherwise,
I'll have to carry you.

I see Jonathan knows
how to handle a woman.

What's this?

We had to borrow
a carriage to get away.

She was in it.
It's Lindsey's daughter.

We didn't know
what to do with her.

Pei-Shu, we could use her

as a bargaining chip.

We are not kidnappers.
I don't like this.

We'll keep her until morning

and decide then.

{Men speaking Asian language}

{Baby crying}

{Crickets chirping}

{Chen}: It's a list of villages.

It tells all the merchants
how many people to enslave.

They drug our people and
send them to forced labour.

{Wang}: Is there
no end to their evil?

{Pei}:
We have to warn the villages.

{Wang}: I'll go.

{Chen}: See to it.

You did well today.

{Blowing whistle}

Goodnight.

You all right?

I saw the man
who had my father killed.

How did you feel?

I didn't know you could
hate another person so much.

You have to let go.

I can't.

I don't know how.

The news?

Nothing, sir.

I thought you might be hungry.

So...

here's breakfast.

Thank you.

Might not be
what you're used to,

but it's good.

Do you care to join me?

I shouldn't.
I have things to do.

Like kidnapping
other young English girls?

We didn't hurt you.

We didn't know you were there
or you were Lindsey's daughter.

What do you know
of my father?

He's a wonderful man.

He's done everything for me.

And he's been a good friend

to the Chinese people.

You mean the Manchu Governor
and the Hong merchants.

In the city,
all of the Chinese respect him.

He has brought nothing
but pain and hardship

to my people.

Where did you get
that "your people" stuff?

You're not Chinese.

{Sighing}

Jonathan...

I know who you really are.

{Men shouting
in Asian language}

Well?
Notices are everywhere, sir,

and we're searching
homes for anyone

that might have been involved
in yesterday's events.

And they know not to be gentle
in their questioning.

That they do, sir.

I've come to offer my help.

Those bloody swine!

They are like the fog.

They come in stealth...

and disappear.

But this time,
someone will talk.

I propose
to double your reward.

Your generosity moves me.

{Horse neighing}

Hey, hey!

What's troubling you?

The girl we brought here.

Yes.

She knew my name.

Perhaps she heard
Tian say it on the boat.

She says she knows
who I really am.

So do I.

You're Jonathan
of Xidong Village,

an orphan we took in...

as one of our own.

She meant who I was
before I came here.

Life is about who you are,

not who you were.

I want to kill her father,

but she seems so...

nice, helpless.

I don't know.

Don't think about it too much.

Life is simple.

I hope you enjoyed the show.

It--it wasn't me;
I didn't see anything.

So you mean I'm nothing?

No. You're really something.

So...

you were watching.

No. I mean...

not...

{Grunting}

Queen of Skies,
Mistress of Night,

grant me power
to escape this place.

Make truth from lies,
and pity my plight.

Let Jonathan
believe my face.

I can tell;

you are your father's seed.

The shoot bends
as the branch before.

I have no idea
what you're talking about.

Here, there has
always been shelter

for those in need.

You will never know
what true peace is.

I know what will happen
when my father finds you.

I know. I know.
It--it's my fault.

Oh, I wouldn't be
so hard on myself, sir.

No, no.
I accept full responsibility.

{Chuckles}

You know,
they say this is priceless.

My daughter...

is priceless.

And who do I put
in charge of finding her?

A raving...

drivelling...

second-rate incompetent!

{Knocking on door}

Won't you join me?

Give me your hand.

Give me your hand.

See?

We're alike.

We're both English, not Chinese.

We were born in the West.

I was born here.

My mother died having me.

Your father
had my father killed.

Who told you that?

Chen. He was the one
who saved me.

He's obviously the one
who killed your father.

That's not true.

They've obviously filled
your head with stories.

And now they're going
to kill me as well.

That's rubbish.

No one is going to hurt you.

Do you think
they can let me go now?

Now that I know where you are?

Jonathan...

What you're saying
is all lies.

But what if it isn't?

Jonathan, I'm so frightened.

Please hold me.

Chen wants to see you.

{Chen, echoing}:
Are you all right, Jonathan?

{Jonathan, echoing}:
What are you staring at?

{Xi Guay, echoing}:
A complete fool.

Look at me.
I'm not from here.

All these years,
and I still don't belong!

Lindsey is torturing
innocent people

to find his daughter.
What did you expect?

We started this.

{Xi Guay}: Even a beautiful
snake can be treacherous.

Then what did you want?

{Wang, echoing}: I still say
we should get rid of her.

Put these on.

{Wang}: It's the only way
to stop them.

{Chen}: No.

Um... Help me.

Come with me.

{Wang}: Let me take care of it.
I will do it.

Thank you.

We were meant for each other.

Not so far away...

yet not near.

In a village by the water...

there is an old man
and a younger man

who are blocking the way.

I was afraid
this would occur.

Wang wants her dead.
I heard him.

Wang is hot-headed
and full of anger.

Chen and I would
never allow it.

{Lindsey}:
What else do you see?

{Speaking Asian language}

The young one...

he has the power of the dragon.

He seeks...

but cannot find.

If this one find
the fire of the dragon,

we are all of us in danger.

You are going nowhere.

{Groaning}

Hyah! Hyah!

I have a score to settle
with your dragon.

Help!

Someone!

When I find him...

I'll send him
to the eighth level of hell.

{Rooster crowing}

How is he?

He's been poisoned,

with Moon Shade
and Spider's Claw.

Is there something I can do?

The only way to fight
poison is with poison.

What we need
is the Song of Midnight.

Where can I find it?

It's a silver flower that
grows among blue leaves.

The only place I've seen it

is in Governor Fung's garden.

I'll go at once.

No, you can't!

I have to.

I've been such a fool.

If anything happens
to Uncle Pei...

I've made it wrong.
Now I'll make it right.

I am happy
you are safe and sound.

Are you certain
you're all right, my darling?

I'm fine, Daddy.

They're imbeciles, really.

Especially that Jonathan.

I can't believe
you let him get away.

{Chuckles}

Don't fret.

He'll pay.

They'll all pay.

Mmm...

{Speaking Asian language}

{Dog barking in distance}

{Dog barking}

{Guards speaking
Asian language}

{Dog barking}

Hiyah!

{Grunting}

{All screaming}

You shouldn't
have come for me.

Quick. We better move.

They'll send more men soon.

You idiots! Do you have any
idea of risk you were taking?

Uncle Pei?

He is still among us,
only barely.

Go!

{Coughing}

Jonathan...

{Groaning}

You have the world's...

biggest heart.

But there's...

work to be done...

on what goes on...

in this head of yours.

{Coughing}

I made your favourite.

Mushroom with eggplant.

You shouldn't have.

I know that. I wanted to.

Nothing will ever
be the same again.

We'll have to leave

the only place I've
ever known as home.

Has Chen decided
where we're going?

He picked out
a safe place downriver.

We'll leave in groups
after dark

and meet at the temple ruins.

Can I come, too, Papa?

No, my darling.

You've had enough
adventures for a while.

But I want to see you
punish those men

who were so mean to me.

Please?

All right.

That's the wretched little
pigsty they kept me in.

Come.
They can't have gone far.

Isn't Father wonderful?

Yes, His Lordship
is most impressive.

I've decided to do him
a great honour.

I've decided to marry you.

It will cement our alliance.

{Laughing}

What an amazing idea!

{Speaking Asian language}

{Chen}: Where's Jonathan?

Wang, have you seen him?

He stay behind.

Ah!

My young friend,

have you learned nothing
from our time together?

Vengeance is not
the path of the dragon.

There is a fire in you,
Jonathan,

but it's fed by a darkness.

When the stars are right,

the dragon's heart
will show you the way.

Let's go!

No!

NO!

NO!

I think it's high time
you learned some manners.

{Grunting}

Ah!
{Grunting}

After him!
Go! Shoot the boy!

{Gunshots}

Chen!

Let's go!

{Sighing}

{Lindsey}:
Your arrival was very timely.

{Guard shouting
in Asian language}

Daddy.

Daddy, the most dreadful
thing just happened.

Don't fret, my darling.

Young Jonathan's
used up all his luck.

No, it's not that.
Fung wants to marry me!

The audacity.

On the other hand,

if he were to, um,
expire during his sleep,

no one would
question the cause.

Perhaps even
on our wedding night.

{Speaking Asian language}

We've captured
the head of the dragon!

What did you learn?

Lindsey's daughter
is to marry Governor Fung.

{Laughing}

This could work for us.

With everyone at the
Governor's residence,

we could search Lindsey's
home for some clues.

What about Chen?

Chen will be there.

He is to be executed
during the wedding feast.

{Wang}: What?

When?

Two days' time.

Where?

At the Fungs' mansion.

That's not a lot of time.

But it will have to do.

It's all we have.

{Thunder rumbling}

{Thunder rumbling}

{Grunting}

Come on!

{Men speaking Asian language}

And how is the widow-to-be?

I feel ridiculous.

But I'd feel even more foolish

if I didn't take
that monstrosity

for everything he's worth.

I can't tell you
how proud I am.

{Drums beating}

{Crowd applauding}

{Crowd applauding}

Ladies and gentlemen,

please permit me,
as father of the bride,

to make a toast.

I can think of no one
I would prefer as son-in-law

than the honourable
Governor Fung.

May you both find...

eternal happiness.

{Crowd chattering}

To make this day
truly memorable,

I offer as a wedding gift,

and for your
general entertainment...

the leader of the scourge

that has terrorized
our community!

{All chattering excitedly}

Tonight,
Manchu and English justice

will swing as one,
bringing to an end...

this worthless life.

But first,
for your pleasure...

may I present
the finest performer

of the Szechuan Opera,

the Master of Masks!

{All applauding}

{Traditional Chinese
music playing}

{Crowd cheering}

{Lindsey}: Bravo!

You! Come here!

You're quite astonishing,
you know.

And I'm not often impressed.

Show me your true face.

I said show me your face,

little dancer.

{Fung grunting}

You heard her.

Our patience runs out.

{Crowd chattering excitedly}

Predictable to the end.

Just like your father.

{Crowd screaming}

Ah!

Ah!

Jonathan!

{Xi Guay screaming}

Let me show you

the proper way
to handle a woman.

{Grunting}

Daddy!

Daddy...

Daddy, are you all right?

Are you all right?
Daddy?

Hey!

It was I who killed your father!
I'm the one you want!

You're nothing but a pawn.

But you'll kill
no more of my people.

{Screaming}

Come on.

{Groaning}

No!

Lord Lindsey,
with great respect,

I've come to claim my wife,

my property.

Business, yes.

Business.

Please, Daddy.

Please, Daddy,
don't make me.

It's going to be all right.
Don't make me.

It's going to be all right.
Please. Daddy.

{Speaking Asian language}

So our little Wushu dragon

finally learned to breathe fire.

It's hard to believe I used
to push you into the river.

{Both laughing}

So...

how did you do it?

I just, uh...

I saw Lindsey with Xi Guay.

The question is,

can you do it again?

{Both laughing}
