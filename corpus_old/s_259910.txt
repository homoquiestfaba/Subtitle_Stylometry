<i>In the name of the Father, and</i>
<i>of the Son, and of the Holy Splrit.</i>

My sisters and brothers,
the Lord be with you.

What took you so long?

They're going to put me in that
baby room, all the kids screaming.

I told them you're sick. Don't you...
No, frankly, no. I don't.

Don't you see they realize you're
sick every time he's an alter boy?

It 's the middle of the week.
He says it 's Lent.

We're Greek-Orthodox, Spike!

It 's all the same thing.
He's happy, it 's Jesus, who cares?

So now we're Catholic?
Let him be a Catholic!

I don't get that!
It wouldn't kill you...

Why do I have to go to
somebody else's church for?

Because he wants to go to somebody
else's church? Why don't you two go?

Your mother and me are worried.
The way you've been acting lately.

Is there something wrong
that we don't know about?

Those shoes you got, they're weird.
That makes you walk funny.

Why don't you act like other kids?

"Szechuan".

In China, it 's "Szechuan"...

and, next week...

we're going to go to
a"Szechuan" restaurant...

on a class excursion,
just before the end of the year.

Also before the end of the year,
our young man...

who's on the exchange program
with a Catholic school in London...

he's a mister...

Dobbs, you old slag, and it 's
Manchester. It 's a different city.

Mr. Dobbs, please!

You're going to march down to Sister
Michael-Stevens office this minute.

The insolence!
Stop smiling at him, Pauly.

Can I sit here? You didn't call me
back the other night. What 's that?

Can I share your menu?

He's joining basketball.
He's got guitar lessons that night.

He'll just have to stop
guitar lessons for the season.

No harm, community basketball.

There's something
going on that 's funny.

Basketball.

You've got to...

transfer to public school
for senior year.

Make them let you.

She can't hear.

Your father has an announcement.

There'll be no more guitar lessons.
You'll join community basketball.

I'm transfering to public school.

We'll think about that. We let you
transfer to Catholic school...

but you can't keep
flipping back and forth...

even though we aren't Catholic.

So in the mean time...
Join the team and see if you like.

For senior year,
either I transfer or I quit!

We'll talk about the other stuff,
public school, that 's later.

You haven't tried basketball.
You should try things, okay?

What do you think?

Dinner!

He'll be all right
once he's in the game.

I've got another boy
but he's an infant.

Pauly's just...
He'll get the hang.

You know, I was All-County.

Come on!

Sure you don't mind not playing?
Because you're still on the team.

You're still considered.
Hey, you guys!

Come on! Quit the hyjinks!

The chords sometimes,
you know...

I'm not as old as I look.

I think I'm getting married.

To Jesus?

I've missed things.

I don't want to miss anything, ever.
There's so much.

I want everything, all at once,
I don't care.

Color! Freedom!
Other things...

You're transferring.
Your father and I... talked.

You can't dress like that.

Come over to my house,
after school.

That 's Marta, the student body.
She says she's a virgin...

but I know at least two guys she blew
in the ninth grade at the quarry.

Guess what! I transferred! Same as
you. I'm supposed to join clubs now.

What 'd you join? I'm definitely
joining Theater Guild!

Where did you get that shirt?

Okay, I hate you now.

You should try for something guys
try for, like sports or something.

If you're new here and you're a
theater fag, that 's death. Forget it.

I transferred last year...

and now I'm really,
really popular.

They let anyone on the team, the
team's for shit. And you never play.

Then you get invited
to all the parties, right?

And all the girls on the teams
date the guys on the teams.

The drum major just quit! His mother
had a nervous breakdown...

at somewhere. And we'll be totally
fucked in competition next month!

Fucked, do you hear me?
Fucked, fucked, fucked!

You'll hear on Monday.

The only way you can get away with
being drum major, if you get it...

is by being on some other team.
Drum major by itself is too queerbo!

I have new friends now, Colin.
I don't care.

I'm only auditioning for credit.
All you have to do is sing a song.

They need 3O people for the chorus.
A song?

He makes you sing with sheet music.
Who?

That guy.

Just, please, just... Noel.

No "mister". If you say Mr. Somebody
you imply certain hierarchical...

Those of you just getting here,
I'm a student teacher.

I'm in school myself.
Sophomore, college.

I'll be directing
my own adaptation of...

Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel,
"The Scarlet Letter".

It 'll be called "A".

Which is really great, great
Hawthorne. Hawthorne wrote it.

He was a great social critic.

And we'll be doing
a musical theater version.

Okay, so, are there any questions
before we begin?

So we can just begin.

Marta? Marta Walburg.

Hi, Marta. I'm Noel, I'm a student
teacher, I'm directing "A".

The spring play, yeah.
Thanks.

I'm auditioning for Hester,
the lead.

Great. Whenever you're ready.

I'm not looking for...
You don't have to...

I'm not looking for beatiful voices.

I'm looking for... honesty.

Okay.

<i>He touched me</i>

<i>He put hls hand In mlne</i>
<i>And then he touched me</i>

I usually work
professionally.

I think I'm a shoe-in. Because
they need someone impish.

And Marta is wrong, because Pearl
is the lead, not Hester.

And I have a really big range.

That was good, Marta.

I only need 8 bars, so you...
When are call backs?!

I can't come back tomorrow!
Just put that down on your card, OK?

Okay, who's next?

Rusty McGee?

You can go after Rusty.
And your name is?

I'm ready.

Colin said we can get credit.
Can me and him go together?

That 's Colin.
Can I just give you my key?

Did you tell me what your name is?

I know you're gonna get drum major
because Jamey, who was it before...

had something really weird about
him that Mr. Fontaine hated...

and you completely don't have,
and that 's when you conduct...

your whole body is really in it,
and not just your arms.

If it was just your arms, forget it.

You forgot to close your locker!

Why do you wanna be in the play?

You know, I got muscles where
guys don't even have muscles...

When did you get your hair?
Down there, I mean.

Eleven, and chubbers
since I was, like, six.

It 's hot down here. Are you hot?
It 's hot lately.

Spring to summer.

You're not hot?
No.

A little.

In the summer we belong
to the pool, you wanna come?

Maybe.

You see the girls' nipples when
their suits are wet. Hard and shit.

Feel this muscle.

It 's just a play, and this guy
is directing it from college.

And I'll get A.P. credit if I do it,
it won't take away from track...

If you get drum major,
are you gonna take it?

I don't know.

Man, all I think about is pussy.

Don't be in that faggity play.

I've got homework.

You don't wanna wrestle?

Where were you?

Where were you?
I don't know!

Don't be in places you don't know!

Do your mother and me that favor!

You auditioned for the spring play?
It counts for A.P. English.

Since when?
Is it warm?

There's a big kegger this weekend.
You gotta show up and bring a date.

It 's really warm.

A.P. credit for real?

The cast list is up! It 's up!

I can be on the stage crew.

Hi.
Hi.

I'm on the list.
Sure, Paul.

Pauly. Or Paul.

Pauly.

I really liked your balad.
Come on.

No, I did.

The "Our Father" is the only
thing I know that 's slow.

It was...

heartfelt.

But you should really leave
that on the board, though.

Pauly?
Noel?

We need to have
a serious conversation.

You're playing a townsperson, okay?

There's no lines...

but I really wanna try something
unique with the townspeople.

Okay.

I can paint too.
You know, sets or something.

"A" takes place in colonial America
and most of my work, my painting...

has been about colonial America.

Your phone is ringing.

I don't like the phone too much.

Guard this with your life, Pauly.

Excuse me.
Congratulations.

Now I'm willing to work around your
track and theater guild schedule...

but I'm going to ask for a strong
band commitment. Can you give that?

Since I'm the moderator of both,
I'll coordinate schedules with Noel.

I think it 's all going to work out.
After all, you have a small part.

But he wanted to do something
unique with the townspeople!

Oh, my God, really?
Are you for real?

How's he gonna do the work?
I'll do the work.

He'll do the work!
He's got a band, track, A.V.

He resigned.
Resigned from A. V? You just started!

He's an A student.
I'm an A student.

And now a play?
The school work comes first!

He knows!
I can do it.

Is he making friends?
Well...

What did you do to your jeans?
Don't worry about the jeans.

He's a boy,
they rip their jeans.

Hawthorne was a great
romantic as well...

and for that to come alive
on stage, visually...

I need to strike a kind
of beautiful balance.

That sounds so pretentious.
No.

But they're all pariahs. All of them.
Even Dimmesdale. Even little Pearl.

It 's really about class.

Maybe.
Structures, oppression!

Exactly. Have your read any Marx?
No. But I've made some sketches.

I checked about the A.P. English
credit. It 's for real, don't ask me.

So why not?
Forget it!

He wants townspeople of many colors.
And he's right. It 's a metaphor.

Totally forget it.

Is somebody there?

I have some more sketches.

That was you?
I remember you in that.

They said I was the best Abraham
Lincoln in the history of the school.

I was, like, twelve.
My mom took me.

I was tortured...
as the character.

You were great.

Where's your hat?
He just forgot.

The hat is for them to see you.
He just forgot it somewhere, okay?

The hat, the plume, when you're
down on the, marching in front of...

You have the plume for them to see,
something to look for!

Please, it 's okay, okay?

Or who knows where they're marching!

Not now, Ludmilla.
Okay.

Leadership. If this is the foot
we're going to get off on...

Come over tonight, at 8 o'clock.
We can practice, okay?

Sure!

Where are you going?
I've got play rehearsal!

He's gonna murder you!

You're late! I just gave
a whole talk about lateness...

and people being late!

He said I could be on stage crew!

Okay, everyone who's not in
costume, please stand off stage!

Marta, because you're so naturally
pretty, we're gonna costume you...

She is not so pretty!

I left my band hat at your house.

Why hold your cigarette like that?
What?

Guys go like this
and girls hold like this.

I'll bring your hat by at 6
and then we need to talk.

Don't you think there's
something, like, he's weird?

There's one last kegger for the year.
Go or you're sunk in everyone's eyes.

Where are my socks?
What? In your drawer.

The ones with the elastic!
Your dress socks? What?

The white tube socks that stay up!
I don't know. What 's the problem?

Why can't we afford better socks?

We send you to public school, that 's
supposed to be the end of the problem!

Everybody has better
socks than we do!

All the socks in the house are very,
very fine enough for most people.

There's a boy at the front door!

This is my brother's car,
he just let me drive it.

It 's for girls. It 's, you know,
a fuck truck, or something.

They are always
on me and they...

My parents fight and I think, "Why
would anybody want...", you know?

They fight when he drinks. Dad.

She drinks too.
We all drink. A little bit.

I blow up sometimes.

Today I thought everything was bad.

For about three hours, everything
just wasn't so good in my head.

Pauly?

I know different types of people...
I'm sure.

I bet.

...and you're certainly
one of the most talented.

My hat is at your house.

He's making friends.

I don't care what he does,
as long as the grades are up.

A boy came by tonight.
At his age I did all kinds of things.

With big, sad eyes.
But I kept the grades up.

Sad eyes?

It was hot today.
I'll get your hat.

Spring or something. It 's only
March and it 's really warm.

There's the pool.

I'll get your hat.

I can't.
What?

I can't do "A".

I've reduced the complexities
of the novel into boulevard clichÃ©s.

What if we take the townspeople
in a kind of Meyerhold direction?

Ritualized gestures.
They are all cogs in a system.

Where is everybody?

It 's quiet.
For now, it is. They go out.

Your brothers are big.
I'm the runt.

Your brother's suit is too big.

I like it when it 's 2 a.m.

You're always touching the water.
I do.

You're like a mermaid or something.

2 a.m. is the best time.

"I've heard the mermaid singing..."
I like the water.

"...each to each."

2 a.m. is... Yeah.

Your teeth are so straight.
Braces.

"I don't think they'll sing to me."

T. S. Eliot.

I'm seventeen.

Braces?

You should really
wear a bathing suit.

I know all types of people...

You said that once already.

There's something I wanna say.

I really like girls.

Okay.

I hate that freaking play!

You missed the last kegger. Forget
about any reputation you could have!

Where do you think he is?
Practice.

Second night this week this late.

Practice?
What are you talking about?

At midnight, what do you think
a teenager is practicing?

Track? How do I know?
What do you want from me?

Be concerned. Is that too much?
Read your book.

Your weird son is out there doing
God knows what!

He's your weird son, too.

Noel?

Oh, my God.

What are you doing?

Out in the middle...
Guy, this is...

I mean, where are we?
...Pauly.

Guy. Hi.
Hi.

My car just broke down, I looked
around and I'm like, "Where am I?"

I'm directing something.

It 's nothing, really. High School.

Well, nobody has seen you in,
like, forever.

Mark is nuts again.

Paolo is repainting everything.
Can you imagine?

No.

Call me some time.

Yeah.

Who is that?
Some guy.

How do you know him?
I used to work with him at a place.

Where have you been?

Pizza Hut.

The Stack.

Pizza Hut or The Stack?
The Stack!

The Stack or Pizza Hut?

The Stack! The Stack.

How old is that boy,
that boy with the big eyes?

My age.

You both should know that Pauly's
commitment to band is sorely lacking.

Go. Stay.

I had a close friend
in High School too.

We had a lot in common.
We were on Yearbook Commitee.

Then we became aware
of what other people thought.

And people with nothing better
to think about end up thinking...

things.

I can do set design
and be a drum major, too.

Pauly, Noel is a professional...

Sure. I know.

...and I've met his girlfriend.

I might not go to the dorm-dorms,
I might go to the apartment-dorms.

Yes?

You can move in, the apartment-dorms
you don't need ID for.

I'm waiting to hear from colleges.

Well, whatever.
I haven't heard.

Whatever, you know?

Who is your girlfriend?

You.

Hands, you know?

What?

Wait.
What?

Pauly...

come on, give it back.

Take mine.

I'm almost out!
Did he say anything?

What?
He came into my room before...

and Noel is staying over because
he got locked out of his house!

Wait till I'm out!
I found no blankets for the floor!

What are you talking about?
He might 've thought something.

Your friend got locked out?
Just wait, I'll be out in a minute!

How's the play?

Bet I'll hate it. It 's faggy.
That 's why I quit stage crew.

You're hanging out with Noel.
Everybody thinks that 's weird.

Coach says if I cut my hair,
I'll be more aerodynamic.

You look weird.

I think something's stuck.

Why would a person do such a thing?

Putting rings in places
they don't belong!

What are you?

What are you?

Pauly has his play tonight.

We couldn't get a sitter.

I guess no one likes this casserole.
It was a new recipe.

Your father and I think you're
seeing too much of that boy.

We don't want him around.
Your father and I agree that...

Your ring was red.
No, it wasn't.

Your birthstone, it was red!
It changed.

Who has your ring?
The girl with the flute.

No, she doesn't.
Clarinet!

Where's your ring?
Wouldn't you like to know?

Someone has his ring!
Wouldn't that make you happy?

It 's the girl with the flute!
Clarinet!

It 's a clarinet! Why can't
you get anything right?!

I'm gonna have that boy arrested!

I know he's up to no good! Don't
think I don't know what he's up to!

You're grounded!
He's grounded.

So?

So?
So what about rock stars?

What are we waiting for?

I better get A.P. credit
for this or you're dead.

We planned a whole thing
for the cast and anybody in...

What do they know?

What does anybody know?

Wait a minute.

Oh, my God!

I totally screwed up that part where
we jeer Hester at the stockade.

I know everybody saw it.

It 's just a different interpretation.
What 's wrong with that?

I don't know.

It 's just that... I used to be cute.

And I don't fucking
feel cute anymore!

My voice cracked.

My voice cracked, man. Do you
have any idea what that means?

It 's over.

Now I'm just this
ex-fucking baby face.

You know, we're not
kids anymore, Pauly.

You could come inside.
What am I doing?

Everyone is inside.
What do I have?

They didn't get it.
I'm twenty. What do I have?

Do you know what can happen?
She wouldn't...

Mr. Fontaine...
Everyone thinks they know.

Nobody got it.

Nobody.

The scholarship means I have
to concentrate on school.

Get my head on school.
They didn't get it!

They think they know,
and who knows?

There's just so much.

Everything.

If we just... can just...

It 's Marta, right?

Well, Marta's tits aren't real!
I know and Rusty knows!

Everybody knows but you!

We did the show tonight.

Study group.

They just left.

Do you wanna get some...?

Go some...?
No.

No.

Trains, you know, they're always
going somewhere.

The interstate?
Your car broke down.

Oh, my God. Right.

Noel says hi.

We'll be moving in together soon...

to his dorm, apartment-dorm,
not a dorm-dorm.

Look, I've gotta meet
some friends...

Well, these are those friends.

It 's not you I hate.
It 's anyone who's been with Noel.

I hate everybody
who's been with Noel.

When you say "with Noel",
you mean, like, what?

I haven't slept in two days!

You know I hated you
when I first met you?

And now I think...

you're kind of...

blond!

I'm so tired...

but my eys still won't shut.

How about that?

He says, why does
anybody get married...

why they stay together, but I know.

I want some day...

everything.

I'm new to the city...

I thought you could read this.

We're going to see a person,
someone... all of us.

Mom?
Someone who...

deals with... things.
What?

Nothing.

Sleep.

No, no. No, sir.
You get up.

You missed track meet, you're not
going to miss the band competition.

You get up!

Are you aware... are you aware...

You are aware that today
is the band competition?

So you just weren't going
to call me? That 's...

That 's what?

What, Pauly?

What?

I had to play your townsperson
and my townsperson...

and that 's two fucking
townspeople too many.

This is for the final report.

Mr. Spencer says "Gene Val Gene",
like he's some Italian barber.

"Gene"! It 's Jean. He's French.
Even I know that.

And Sister Carrie?
Forget it.

I'm finally thinking we're on our
way to some serious storytelling...

she is like no sister that I know.

I couldn't find the pencils.

Prom is in two weeks.

Sorry you missed the meet.
I won hurdles.

Apparently I have inborn talent.

I hope you don't mind, I asked
Ludmilla to go to the Prom together.

You look good.

Rusty inhaled a leaf, so we had
to cancel the last performance.

You've been drawing.

Your father can't come till tonight.
He has work.

I can only stay a little now. Your
grandmother needs a lift somewhere.

Okay.

Your grandmother didn't want me
to marry your father.

I was pregnant, but I would've
married him even still.

It was a cold one. November.

Picked me up in his car. We went
to a diner and had French toast.

Back in the car,
he tasted like syrup.

We weren't so cold in the car.

I want grandchildren.

It was just your friend, right?
It wasn't you. You didn't want to.

It 's like when sometimes someone
who wants to stop smoking...

wears perhaps a rubber band
on their wrist.

When they feel like smoking,
they snap the rubber band.

They begin to associate
the pleasure of smoking...

with the pain of the
rubber band snapping.

Do you like that?

What about it do you like?

The shape.

What about the shape?

It 's pleasing...

and pleasure is rare.

Pleasure is complicated.

But pleasure is good.

Hey, Colin.
Hey, Ludmilla.

Where is yours?

Too late.

I'm tired of being so popular.

It 's just too easy. Just watch how
everyone behaves and act like that.

The next time you see me,
I could be less popular.

Your grandmother is going up
to her place in the Poconos.

Your cousins are going with her.
And there's things to do...

and you could be in the country.
Whatever.

Paint, if you wanted.

I saw your pictures.

Look.

He was just right over there.
What 's with him?

He's hungry, what?
He's hungry? You just fed him!

He's a baby!

Come on, get in the car.

I'm coming.

I'd be graduating, but I quit.

Working here, which is great!

I'm going to the Poconos.
That 's so cool!

I've got so many friends up there
and there's Water Mountain...

and six kicking bands
come from that area.

Water Mountain?
You want a Sprite or something?

We get slugs for
the machines as a bonus.
