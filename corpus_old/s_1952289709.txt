to walk on them.

At times willingly or
at times unwillingly.

Similarly, some people
enter into your life. .

And become part of

And then..

.. your life's decisions..

.. are not yours alone.

A strange isolation,
an emptiness is experienced. .

.. within and around you.

This isolation screams..
yells.. creates disturbance

And then..

.. you take a decision.

A Last Decision.

For which you've to pay
a very high price.

I'm from CID.

Inspector Rajeev Chowdhary.

Sir, your family had made a

special request to the
department.

For your security.

Security? - And I was
sent on this assignment.

I was told that you
should know nothing..

.. till I receive orders
from the department.

Sorry for the lie, sir.
But I had no other option.

It must be Ranjit.

Some people are after your life.

Had I not been there.. - What?

And if that's the case then
I should go back home.

My wife is alone.
Anything can happen to her.

It's not possible, sir.

Nothing will happen to your wife

She's absolutely safe.
Look, you can't keep me here.

Your safety is
my responsibility now.

But who gave you
the power to stop me here?

Sorry, sir.

We must wait here.

Okay, tell me something.

Who was the man who
attacked you in the train?

I don't know. - What?

I saw you talking to him and
you're saying you don't know.

I don't know, sir.

Somehow they must
have come to know. .

.. that you're in the train
and he was sent to kill you.

I couldn't keep you there.
Your life was at risk.

Do you know?
The man in the compartment..

.. wanted to kill you too.

He could have killed you
anywhere during the journey.

And I had a fight
with him for the same.

The train was leaving
so I had to let him go.

Look, you have to believe me.

You have no other option.

By the way, who
do you report to?

Officer Tandon !

So, we'll meet again.

What a co-incidence! Bheem!

For the first time..

for my work in so many years.

Because of you.

You're so kind, Victor.

Who did all this?
Don't know, sir.

He and he..

Is equal to zero.

There's a twist in the tale.

Now there'll be fun.

Constable, take them
for the post-mortem.

Orian sir!

AC is on. Do you
want to switch it off?

Yes, switch it off.

Let me breathe the
air of this place. - Okay.

Switch off the AC.

Switch off the AC.

You didn't answer me properly.

Why did you call me son?

From last many years
I didn't call anybody son.

Don't know Rajeev whether
you're aware of it or not. .

.. but I am an
ex-police officer.

But when I joined police force..

.. I was sent on a mission
to tackle a group.

I started working in that
group posing as their man.

We accomplished many big tasks

like in Orissa,
Tamilnadu, Bihar.

They had one thumb rule.

Every member of that
group should have a mark. .

.. on his left shoulder.
See this.

Besides me there were
3 more members in that group.

One was Simon,
the other was Anuvidan..

And the third one was.. Orian.

Orian? - Yes, Orian.

What? - You're not an officer.

And you're not

Orian has sent you, right?

Why do you feel like this?

I didn't waste my years in the
police department doing nothing.

Then?

someone else with you too.

Who was he?

Look, there was

So think before you speak
anything.

Otherwise we'll

C'mon, speak up.

His name is.. David.

I don't know where he is.

But.. I have his number. -Good!

Very good boy!

Good body also! Thakur,

Jai Hind, sir.

Hello! Is Mr. David there?

You called David, so who
else would be there, you idiot?

Come to the point. - Why are you
Mumbai people always in hurry?

Just like your Commissioner.
