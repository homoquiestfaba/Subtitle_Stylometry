Honey, i'm home.
Roger that.

Copy at the boathouse.
Right on time.

Faisil, get your butt in here.
Harry's inside.

Yeah, yeah, i'm coming.
I'm coming.

Hey, were you born in a barn?
Whorehouse.

All right. You got
your fur-coated razor blade there...

and a bunch of guys with guns.

I'm switching to sub-vocal now.

Check, check.

<i>Check, check.</i>
It's talk radio.

<i>You're on the air.</i>
Check.

That guard nearest to you
is moving away.

He's at the service door.
He's inside.

Have you seen Khaled yet?

Yep, there he is.

How come billionaires
are always short?

Excuse me.

Thank you.

Colonel! How are you?

It's so good to see you again.
Yes, it's been a long time.

Terrific.
Who was that guy?

Could you hold this
for a second? Thanks.

<i>You should be crossing the main foyer,</i>
<i>heading for the stairs.</i>

Keep moving. Keep moving.

I'm in the library, heading out
to the second-floor balcony.

Modem in place.
Transmitting now.

Affirmatory.

It's a good hook-up.

These are encrypted files.
It's going to take me a few minutes.

I got your password.

Magnificent, isn't it?
Yes, quite.

I thought i knew Khaled's friends,
but i don't believe i've met you before.

<i>We haven't met,</i>
<i>because I certainly would remember.</i>

Renquist, Harry Renquist.

Juno Skinner.
Juno Skinner.

Come on!

"Juno Skinner,
arts and antiquities dealer...

specializing in ancient Persia."

This is Persian,
if i'm not mistaken.

Very good.
Sixth century BC, to be exact.

Do you like the period?
I adore it.

We got a problem.
Guards are going apeshit down there.

Acquired most of these pieces
for Jamal.

Do you tango?

Tango?

<i>Harry, you do not have time</i>
<i>to tango, buddy.</i>

<i>You copy?</i>

Don't be stopping to smell
the roses now. You hear me?

You gotta get out of there.
Yes! Files are unlocked!

Fast Faisil strikes again.
I'm in. I'm down, baby.

I got my hand up her dress,
and i am going for the gold...

Just copy the goddam files, okay?

Wow. And i thought
this was just gonna be...

another bunch of boring bankers
and oil billionaires.

Seconds count.
Ditch the bitch.

Unfortunately, i have to leave.

I have a plane to catch.

Well, call me sometime.

My offices are in Rome.

I would like that.

Son of a bitch is with her two minutes,
and she's ready to bear his children.

Twinkletoes,
what's your exit strategy?

I'm going to walk
right out of the front gate.

<i>Ballsy. Stupid, but ballsy.</i>

Sir, may i see
your invitation, please?

Sure. Here is my invitation.

Shit. Here we go.

Slight change in plans.

Stay!

We're en route to
the lower rendezvous point.

Repeat, back-up rendezvous point!

Watch it!
It's called ice, and it's slick.

Harry, do you copy? Whoa!
I got it.

Shit!

Whoops!

Oh, my God!

Whoa! I got it!
I got it! I got it!

There he is!
Shit!

Hi, guys.

That worked good.
Right out the old front gate.

Can you lean back a second?

Let's go.
We can still make our flight.

All right, that's it
for Mr Renquist. Okay, go.

We got Harry Tasker billfold,
Harry Tasker passport, ticket stub.

Hotel bill, Tasker.
I got two postcards here from Geneva.

Got some house keys right there...

and i've got a souvenir
Swiss snowing village.

What's that for?
It's for Dana, stupe.

Bring your kid home a gift,
the dad thing.

Nice touch.

Pick me up tomorrow at 8:00.
Will do.

The debriefing is at 1000.

See you at 8:00. Bye.
Hey, Harry.

Did you forget something?

What a team.

Sleep fast, buddy.

Hi, honey. How was your flight?

It was fine.
Good.

Brought you a little gift
from Switzerland. Snowy village.

Wow. Thanks, Dad.

I've never had one of these.
You're welcome.

You're late for school.
You better get going.

Don't forget to feed Gizmo.
Okay.

It's pretty lame.

I'm late.
Yeah, me too.

How'd it go at the convention?
Make all the other salesmen jealous?

It was fantastic.
You wouldn't believe it.

You should have been there.
We were the big hit of the show.

With that new model ordering system,
the 680 i told you about...

i can write up an order
and immediately...

as soon as the customer's name comes up,
you see what his credit line is...

what he has ordered in the past,
what discount he has gotten.

Every little detail.
Sounds great.

It's fantastic. That's why
i love the computer business.

Listen, the plumber called.

He says he has to dig under the slab
or something that's gonna cost $600.

That's okay.
It's not okay. It's extortion.

What did you tell him?

I slept with him and
he said he'd knock off $ 100.

That's good thinking.
Bye, honey.

Hello!

Boy, i remember the first time
i got shot out of a cannon.

Good morning. Go to school.
Yeah, i am.

Thanks, dear.

Check these out.

Check them out.

Where's the image coming from?

Got a CCD camera and a transmitter
in a pack of smokes out there.

It's pretty cool, huh?

What the hell?

Bye, Dad!

She's ripping you off.
I knew it.

Let's go!

Can't stop! I'm late! Bye, Dad!

God. Shit.

<i>Kids. Ten seconds of joy,</i>
<i>30 years of misery.</i>

I got married three times, but at least
i was never dumb enough to have any.

She shouldn't be stealing.
I taught her better than that.

You're not her parents any more,
you and Helen.

Her parents are
Axl Rose and Madonna.

Five minutes a day you spend with her
can't compete with that bombardment.

You're outgunned, Daddy-o.

It's not just
because you're a bad parent.

Kids today are ten years ahead
of where we were at the same age.

Morning.
Morning, Mr Tasker.

I bet you think she's still a virgin.
Don't be ridiculous.

She's only... What is she now?
She's 14.

She's only 14.
Her hormones are going like an alarm.

It's even money she lets that physicist
on the bike boink her.

Not Dana.
"Not Dana."

Denial. It's not just a river
in Egypt no more, is it?

She's probably stealing the money
to pay for an abortion.

Why don't you open the door?

Or drugs.

Twenty here, 50 there. I figured
my wife's boyfriend was taking it.

He takes everything else. There's
never a beer in the goddam fridge.

<i>- Thought you moved out.</i>
<i>- I had to move back in.</i>

<i>My lawyer said it'd give me</i>
<i>a better shot at getting the house...</i>

<i>during the property settlement,</i>
<i>but don't change the subject.</i>

<i>- You still owe me 200 bucks.</i>
<i>- Good morning, Janice.</i>

Good morning.
Identify yourselves to the scanner.

Harry Tasker, 10024.
Albert Gibson, 34991.

All right, Frances. I don't believe
we need you any longer now. Thank you.

Sweet Jesus. You sure screwed
the pooch last night, didn't you?

Would you please tell me how i can see
this as anything but a total disaster?

"Total" is a strong word.

There are different
degrees of totality.

It's a scale, really, with
a perfect mission on one end...

and then a total pooch screw
on the other, and we're more on this...

Faisil, you're new on Harry's team,
aren't you?

Yes.

So what makes you think the slack
i cut him in any way translates to you?

Let me show you what we got.

Jamal Khaled. We think he's dirty,
so we raid his private financial files.

One hundred million in wire transfers
from the Commerce Bank international.

Which is a front for certain countries
to finance terrorist activities.

That's why we think
something really big is going down.

We know that a week ago
four MiRV warheads were smuggled...

out of the former
Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan.

We think Khaled's group bought the nukes
and is trying to bring them to US soil.

So far this is not
blowing my skirt up, gentlemen.

Don't you have anything
remotely substantial?

Harry, do you have any hard data?

Nothing you would call rock-hard.
Actually it's pretty limp, sir.

Then perhaps you better get some...

before somebody parks an automobile
in front of the White House...

with a nuclear weapon in the trunk.

It's not like
he's saving the world or anything.

He's a sales rep, for Christ's sake.

Whenever i can't sleep,
i ask him to tell me about his day.

Six seconds and i'm out.

He acts like he's curing cancer
or something.

I guess this means you didn't
get away for the weekend after all.

Harry had to go out of town.
I'm shocked.

Yeah, well, you know Harry.

What's up?
Check this out.

There's a $2 million disbursement
from Khaled to Juno Skinner.

That's right.
The babe at the party.

That doesn't mean anything.
She buys antiquities for Khaled.

He keeps his antique buys
on a completely separate ledger.

This is a little above market rate
for the horizontal bop...

even for a total biscuit
like her.

I want a complete workup on her.

Do we know where she is?
Right here in River City.

She lives in Rome, but she does stuff
for the Smithsonian.

She has a lot of diplomatic connections,
so she has offices here.

I guess it's time
to send in a specialist.

Care to tango?
Yes, i would.

Assholes.

It's all set up. You got a fax machine,
ghost phones, all the usual stuff.

You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel
under the name of Renquist.

Reality check. Let's go.

My name is Harry Renquist. I own
an art consulting firm in San Francisco.

I have an appointment
with Miss Skinner.

Harry!
Hello.

Hello.

I thought i'd see you again.
I just didn't know it would be so soon.

What's the point of waiting?
I agree.

Your clients are looking for something
for the lobby of their new headquarters?

They would like to see something
very dramatic.

That's a nice piece.

I talked to a number of people,
and they all said you're the one to see.

Really? Checking on me.

So what did these people
say about me exactly?

That you can read ancient Sanskrit
without having to sound out the words...

and other art dealers and archaeologists
don't like you very much.

Those wimps.

It's because i use my diplomatic
contacts to export cultural treasures...

from countries which tell them
to take a hike.

Most of our pieces
come from ancient Persia.

Unfortunately, ancient Persia is 20 feet
under the sand of iran, iraq and Syria.

Not the most popular places
lately.

So i've had to become an expert
in international diplomacy.

Well, Mr Renquist?

Do you see anything you like?

Maybe.

Give me a break. I don't think
they bugged my tuna sandwich.

She's importing stuff
from all over the Mideast.

She could be moving
money, guns, anything.

The second you left, we started
getting calls to the ghost numbers.

They were checking out
the Renquist front.

Let's step up the surveillance
and put on two more guys.

Maurizio, i said Saturday,
not Tuesday. Saturday.

Miss Skinner, may i have
a word with you, please?

Stupid, undisciplined bitch.

It's a good thing
you're paying me a lot of money.

Do you realize there are surveillance
teams watching this place right now?

Your telephones are
almost certainly tapped.

And you were busy laughing and flirting
like a whore with this Renquist...

He checked out okay...

We do not tolerate mistakes.

What would you like me to do?

Find out where this Renquist is.

Hello, Tektel Systems.
Mr Tasker's office.

Hi, Charlene? Hi, it's Helen.
Is he in?

Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs Tasker.
Let me try him in there. Hold, please.

Relay, 10024.

It's a patch from Tektel.

It's Helen.

Hello, honey. How are you?
What's going on?

Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
in the middle of a meeting.

It's just that Dana and i want to make
sure you were gonna be home by 8:00.

We're going to a lot of trouble
for your big birthday.

We just wanted to make sure
that you were gonna be home.

Absolutely.
This time you can count on me.

<i>Promise?</i>
Trust me.

Great.
<i>Got to go. Bye.</i>

Bye.

That's disgusting, Dana.
Calm down.

We got a friend.
Three cars back on the inside lane.

They've been on us
since we left the hotel.

You mean the station wagon?
Yes.

You want me to lose them?
No. We need this lead.

Unit Seven?

Seven here.

<i>We need you at the Georgetown Mall</i>
<i>in three minutes.</i>

<i>Copy. We're rolling.</i>
Helen's gonna be pissed.

This is the problem with terrorists.

They're really inconsiderate
when it comes to people's schedules.

Pull over here. This is good.

Okay, testing, one, two, three.
I got you. I got you. I got you.

They're right with us.
I make three of them in the car.

Dickhead.
Blow me.

I got a couple of them getting out
of the car and coming after you.

Think i'm blind?

<i>You do look like Ray Charles.</i>
<i>So what's the plan?</i>

Just trying to get a closer look
at Beavis and Butt-head.

There's a third one still in the car.
<i>Stay on him.</i>

Hi, Helen. Yeah, it's Gib.
Oh, not much.

Listen, Harry forgot something
back at the office.

You know Harry.

Yeah, Gib, i know Harry. Bye.

<i>Bye. See you soon.</i>

See?

I lost the third guy.

Shit!

Shit! Hold it! Shit!

Here. Cool off.

Sorry about this.

Look out! Get out of the way!

Hey! Freeze!

Oh, thank God.

Get in the car.

Here we go.

Federal officer
in pursuit of suspect.

Sorry.

Harry, what's your 20?
Westbound in the park.

Suspect is on a motorcycle,
and he's coming out on Franklin.

Copy!

I want you on 14th
in case he turns south.

I want Seven on the north side
to box him in.

Make it quick, because
my horse is getting tired.

Your horse?

There he is! That's him!
Come on!

Go around to the back.
<i>Copy that.</i>

Out of my way!

Out of my way!

Sorry.

Excuse me.

Jesus!
Sorry.

Open it!

Excuse me. Excuse me.

Out of the way!

Move! Move! Move!

Federal officer! Get down! Now!
Get off or die!

Get down! Now!
Move!

Turn around! Hold still!

Come on!

Whoa!

Hold still!

Will you press the button
for the top floor, please?

Thank you.

Help!

Shut up!

Whoa.

Say something.

That's a fine animal.

Stay against the glass!

Come on.

So sorry.

Stay there! Don't move!

Come on, come on, come on!

Okay, back up.

Back up.

You can do it.
Come on.

Good horse. Good.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go back now.

Come on.
Yeah, that's teamwork now.

Keep pulling. Come on.

A little bit more.

That a boy.

Okay.

What the hell were you thinking?

I had the guy,
and you let him get away.

Look at me when i talk to you.
What kind of a cop are you anyway?

Hi, honey.

I know you're upset.
I'm sorry.

I hurried home
as fast as i could.

It's okay.

It's okay.

I'm sorry.

Thank you for the party.

Yeah, it was great.

Hey.

That's him.

Pause it right there.
Salim Abu Aziz.

This guy is really hard-core.
Highly fanatical.

The man's a real psycho. He's been
linked to dozens of car bombings.

You know that cafe bomb
in Rome last year? That was his.

As well as a 727 out of Lisbon.
This guy's a major player.

Now he's formed his own splinter faction
called Crimson Jihad.

I guess he thought the other terrorists
were too warm and fuzzy for him.

They call him the Sand Spider.
Why?

Probably because it sounds scary.

This is impressive, gentlemen.

It would be even more impressive
if you actually knew where he was.

We'll get him.

Why don't you pull over here?
What's up?

I really screwed up
with Helen last night.

I'm going to see if she's available
for lunch to smooth things over.

You just want me to hang?
Just hang.

I'll just be hanging.

Hold, please.

It's your mystery man on two.
Simon?

Oh, my God.

Hello? Simon?

Simon?

Yes, i can talk.

You mean right now?

Yes, i can meet you.

Okay, i can't wait.

Bye.

Can you cover me for an hour?

Just an hour? You should tell
that stud to take more time.

Would you shut up?
I should have never told you about him.

Have a good time.

Get a little bit for me
while you're at it.

Hey! Hold it! Fucker!

What's going on? Sick?

Looks like you got gut-kicked.

It's Hel... it's Helen...
it's Helen.

It has something to do with Helen,
i'm guessing.

Helen...

is having an affair.

Welcome to the club, man.

It can't be. Not Helen.

Nobody thinks it could happen to them
the first time.

Same thing happened to me
with wife number two, remember?

I had no idea nothing was going on.
I come home, and the house is empty.

She even took the ice cube trays
out of the freezer.

What kind of a sick bitch takes
the ice cube trays out of the freezer?

It's not Helen.
Helen still loves you.

She just wants to bang this guy
for a while. It's nothing serious.

You'll get used to it soon...
Stop cheering me up!

What'd you expect?

Helen's a flesh-and-blood woman,
and you're never there.

It was just a matter of time.

I say we concentrate on work.

That's what i do every time
my life turns to dog shit.

I concentrate on work,
and that gets me by.

Right, buddy?
It's gonna be great.

We're gonna catch some terrorists.
We're gonna beat the crap out of them.

You're going to feel a hell
of a lot better.

Watch your head.
Okay. All right.

Women. Can't live with 'em,
can't kill 'em.

I came by your office today.

I was in the area, and i thought
you might want to have lunch.

Really? Well,
you must have just missed me.

That's what they said. They said
you had to run out or something.

It was this rush job...

They needed these documents
down at the district courthouse.

So, of course, the big problem...
our printer shut down.

So i went to the third floor
to use theirs, but they have the 1720.

Of course, the disk
isn't formatted for the 1720.

So i had to go back upstairs
and reformat...

go back downstairs
and use their printer.

By the time i got there,
i couldn't get my car to start.

Then traffic...
i barely got there.

So a little excitement
in an otherwise dull day.

Did it work out okay?

Yeah. Great.

I'll check on dessert.

I'm done.

The great thing is that he's practically
given us a blank cheque on wiretaps.

I set them up on all of Juno's
shipping agents and her clients.

Faisil's made a list
of all the possible contacts...

the Crimson Jihad
may have in this country.

Now all we have
to do is sit around...

Hey. This national security stuff
boring you?

Put a tap on her phone.
What? I already did that.

I'm talking about Helen's. Put a tap
on her office line and the house. Now.

Come over here for a second.
That sounds great.

I want to ask you about something.
I got two words to describe that idea...

in-sane. An unauthorized wiretap's
a felony. You know that.

And you're doing it 20 times a day,
so don't give me that crap.

Do it.

<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Helen, it's Simon. Is it safe to talk?</i>

<i>Yes, go ahead.</i>

I can't talk long. Can you meet me
for lunch tomorrow? I must see you.

I suppose so. Where?

Same place, 1:00.
I have to go now. See you tomorrow.

<i>Remember, I need you.</i>

I thought that we might
have lunch together tomorrow.

You know... darn it...

i'm going to meet Allison.
We're going to go shopping. Sorry.

No problem.

I think you're going about
this whole thing all wrong.

Women... they like you
to talk to them.

Maybe it's just that you're not
in touch with your feminine side.

I was watching <i>Sally Jessy Raphael...</i>
All right.

I got all the usual stuff here...
a telemetry burst transmitter.

I got a GPS tracker, an audio
transmitter and a power supply.

I've got it sewn into the lining here...
Hey, Harry?

If you need to talk,
speak into the purse.

Here she comes. She's gonna pop out
right in front of us. Watch this.

Bingo.

Looks like she's going
into Chinatown.

She's parking.

Okay, give me audio.

You sure you weren't followed?

No. I kept looking behind me like
you taught me, but i didn't see anyone.

Okay, it's just that things
are a bit hot right now.

If i get a signal,
i may have to leave suddenly.

I understand.

Look, it's my job to take risks,
but not yours.

<i>I feel bad about bringing you into this,</i>
<i>but you're the only one I can trust.</i>

Were you out on a mission?

We say "op," covert operation.
And this one, well, got a little rough.

Worse than Cairo?
Cairo.

Cairo was a day at the beach
next to this.

The guy's a spook.
But for whom?

He could be working her
to get to you.

Did you read the papers yesterday?
Yes.

Sometimes a story is a mask
for a covert operation.

You see two men killed in a restroom
and two unidentified men...

<i>in a running shootout,</i>
<i>ending at the Marriott?</i>

That was you?

Me.
<i>You're very good.</i>

You recognized my style.

You're a natural at this.

The guy's a fake.
He's taking credit for our moves.

What happened?
Hardly worth talking about.

Two of them
won't bother me again.

Unbelievable.
<i>You chased one?</i>

Something came over me. I had to nail
this guy no matter what the risk.

Pretty hairy. I thought
he had me a couple of times, but i...

i really can't take credit.
Why not?

It's the training. It shapes you
into a lethal instrument.

You react in a microsecond
without thinking.

I'm starting to like this guy.

We still gotta kill him.
That's a given, you know.

The guy is a goddamned
used car salesman.

This keeps getting better and better!

I'm sorry.
I know this has gotta be painful.

But you gotta admit it's funny.
If it was just some idiot, not you...

you'd be laughing your ass off.

One born every minute.

It wants you too.
Feel it vibrate?

Say, how about a little spin?
Sure.

See, it's not just a car.
It's a total image. An identity.

You have to go for it.
This isn't some high-tech sports car.

To tell you the truth,
it doesn't even handle that great.

But that's not the idea, is it?

What are we talking about here?
Pussy, right?

Absolutely.

Let's face it.
The 'Vette gets 'em wet.

But it's not enough.

If you really want to close escrow,
you gotta have an angle.

I suppose you have an angle.

It's killer.

I mean, look at me.
I'm not that much to look at.

No, no, no.
I can be honest.

But i got 'em lining up,
and not just the skanks either.

Well, some are.
What's your angle?

No, sorry. Trade secret.

Okay, just ask yourself:

What do women really want?

You take these bored housewives
married to the same guy for years.

They're stuck in a rut.
They need some release.

The promise of adventure,
a hint of danger.

I create that for them.

So basically you're lying
your ass off the whole time.

I couldn't do that.
What are you, a Boy Scout?

Think of it as playing a role.
It's fantasy.

You gotta work on their dreams...

get them out of their daily
suburban grind for a few hours.

What about their husbands?
Dickless!

I mean, let's face it.
If they took care of business...

i'd be out of business,
you know what i mean?

Those idiots.

You mind keeping it under 90?

I'm still trying
to pay for this dental work.

So, who are you
working on right now?

I always got a couple on the hook.

There's this one right now,
i got her panting like a dog.

It's great.
What does she do?

Some sort of legal secretary
or something.

You know,
uptight and conservative.

But she could be so hot
if she wanted to be.

And with you,
she gets to be real hot.

Red hot!
Her thighs steam.

It's like a dying plant.
Just needs a little water.

Married to some boring jerk.
Some boring jerk?

He doesn't appreciate her.
She's like all these babes.

You get their pilot lit,
they can suck-start a leaf-blower.

She's got the most incredible body,
and a pair of titties...

make you want to stand up
and beg for buttermilk.

Ass like a ten-year-old boy.

So, then she must be
really good in bed then, huh?

Slow down.
You'll miss the turn.

See?

You and this car were made
for each other. Why fight it?

Sure, i got a couple other buyers
on the line, but i like your style.

So, what do you say?

Should we start up
the paperwork?

Let me think about it.

Hold it for me for a day, okay?

Hey, because it's you.

I got today's transcripts.

Not much going on.

Nothing from Simon?
No.

My turn to drive?
Give me the page.

What?
This jumped from page 9 to 11.

Where's page 10?
It's gotta be a typo.

Give me the goddam page!

Seek help, Harry.
<i>Hello?</i>

Helen, i need your help.
Can you meet me tonight?

What's happened?
<i>It's serious.</i>

Meet me on K Street...

under the Key Bridge,
8:00 sharp.

Gotcha.

Shit. It's almost 8:00.

She's still at the house.

<i>The purse is still at the house.</i>

Shit.

Unit Two, Unit Seven,
immediate roll.

Acquire subject
at K Street and Key Bridge.

Vehicle is red and white convertible.
You got exactly six minutes.

Wait a minute.
Are you out of your mind?

You can't pull agents off a priority
surveillance to follow your wife.

That's a misappropriation of resources
and a breach of national security.

You copy?
You're losing it big-time, man.

I have to stop you.
What are you gonna do, tell?

Look, goddam it.
Both of our butts are on the line.

So your life's in the crapper.
Your wife's banging a used car salesman.

It's humiliating, i know,
but take it like a man!

You tell on me, i tell on you.
What are you talking about?

I'm as clean as a preacher's sheets.
I'm as clean as...

What about when you blew
a six-week operation...

because you were busy
getting a blow-job?

You knew about that?

Let's take Franklin.
It's quicker.

Quick, get in.
Hurry up. Let's go.

Two here.
Suspect vehicle in sight.

<i>One male, one female.</i>

Now, don't be alarmed.

If i'm spotted, it'd be best
if they didn't see you.

You should keep your head down
till we're out of the city.

Here, let me help you.

That's better.

<i>Now the woman has her head</i>
<i>in the guy's lap.</i>

<i>Southbound on the Key Bridge.</i>
<i>Two in pursuit.</i>

Roger, Two.
One to Condor, you got a visual?

<i>Roger, One. This is Condor.</i>
<i>Subject is in sight.</i>

<i>Repeat: We have the ball.</i>

<i>We got a pretty good lockup</i>
<i>on infrared.</i>

<i>She's got her head</i>
<i>in the guy's lap, all right.</i>

Maybe she's sleepy.

This is a safe house.

My place in the city
is a little too hot right now.

So is the penthouse in New York.

What is it exactly
you need me to do?

I want you to be my wife.

But i'm married!

It's just for the operation in Paris.
I need to be married.

They'll be looking for a man
travelling alone.

You want me to go to Paris?

Paris, with a quick stopover
in London.

There's a double agent in my outfit.
I don't know who.

There's no one i can trust,
except you.

Can you get away,
just for a couple of days?

I just don't know.

Of course. I'm rushing you.
Forgive me.

Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

Let me pour you some more wine.

I'll do it.
I'll do it.

You just saved my life.

You are incredibly brave.

I have to remind myself
of the fear you must be feeling.

You see, for me
fear is not an option.

Now, in order to pull
this cover story off...

we have to look like two people who are
completely intimate with each other.

The enemy can spot a fake easily.

You see what i mean?
Sorry.

That reaction could
get us both killed.

I'm sorry.
We can't afford that.

Try to relax.

It's just been a long time...

since anybody but Harry's
touched me like that.

It's a little difficult.
I know.

It's awkward for me too.
I'm sorry.

That's all right. Just sit back.
I'm okay.

There. That's better.

Just let yourself
slip into the role.

That's it.

There you go.

Just let yourself go.

That's good.

That's great.

That's it.

No, i can't do this.
I can't do this.

What's wrong? It's okay.
I cannot do this.

I cannot do this!

If not for me...

do it for your country?

Oh, God!
Don't hurt me!

I'll do whatever you want!

Please!
I didn't do anything!

Damn it!

Take her! Take her!
Oh, God, don't hurt me!

Son of a bitch!

<i>Sit down.</i>

<i>I said sit down.</i>

<i>Who do you work for?</i>

Stern, Kessler,
Goldstein & Krumpnick.

I'm just a legal secretary.
Sure, Mrs Tasker.

<i>What were you doing</i>
<i>with the international terrorist...</i>

<i>Carlos theJackal,</i>
<i>taking dictation?</i>

How long have you been
a member of his faction?

I don't know anything
about a faction.

I just met Simon...

or whoever you say he is...

just a couple weeks ago.

I barely know him.

That's not what it looked like
when we found you.

How did you meet him?

Well...

Keep this for me.
I can't afford to be taken with it.

What?
It's a matter of national security.

Please, it's important.
I'll contact you.

Oh, shit.

<i>Why did you continue</i>
<i>to see him?</i>

He said he needed my help.

<i>Not because you were</i>
<i>attracted to him?</i>

You were not attracted
to him at all?

Well, maybe just a little.

So, is cheating a common thing for you?
Never.

So you're telling me
this was your first time?

I wasn't cheating!

Tell me about your husband,
Mrs Tasker.

What can i say about Harry?

He's a sales rep
for a computer company.

So sex with him isn't exactly
waving your flag any more?

That is none of your goddam business!
What kind of questions are these?

<i>You're in a lot of trouble,</i>
<i>so I suggest you cooperate.</i>

If we want to know the most
intimate details about your life...

you'd better tell us.

My husband is a good man.

But he's not exactly ringing
your bell these days, is he?

Let me handle this part.
Do you mind?

<i>Why did you go</i>
<i>to Carlos'hideout?</i>

He wanted me to go to Paris with him
on a mission...

to pose as his wife.

And you agreed?

<i>Why?</i>

I don't know.

<i>I guess I needed something.</i>

What did you need?

I needed to feel alive.

I just wanted to do
something outrageous.

And it felt really good...

to be needed.

And to be trusted.

And to be special.

It's just that there's...

so much i wanted to do
with this life...

and it's like
i haven't done any of it.

And the sand's running out
of the hourglass...

and i wanted to be able
to look back and say...

"See? I did that!

I was reckless and i was wild
and i fucking did it!"

<i>Quite frankly,</i>
<i>I don't give a shit...</i>

<i>whether you understand that or not.</i>

This Simon...

did you sleep with him?

No.
She's lying.

You did not have
sexual relations with him?

Listen, if you're gonna ask me
every question twice...

this is gonna take a really long time,
and i have to get back to my family.

You're not going anywhere, lady.

Just let me out of here!

<i>Answer the question.</i>

Answer the question!
No!

I did not...

sleep with him!

Calm down, please.

You hear me,
you chickenshit bastard?

Calm down.
She could be telling the truth.

Calm down, Mrs Tasker.

<i>Calm down, please.</i>

I've only one more question,
Mrs Tasker.

What?

Do you still love your husband?

Yes, i love him.

I've always loved him...

and i will always love him.

She loves you.
Now what?

There's only one solution
to your problem, Mrs Tasker.

<i>You must work for us.</i>

What are you doing?

Just giving her a little assignment.
You gotta be shitting me!

She wants a little adventure,
so i'm gonna give her one.

I'm offering you a choice.

If you work for us,
we will drop the charges...

and you can go back
to your normal life.

If not, you will go
to a federal prison...

<i>and your husband and daughter</i>
<i>will be left humiliated and alone.</i>

<i>Your life will be destroyed.</i>

Gee. Let me think.

<i>Yes or no?</i>

Of course yes.

What's involved?

You will be contacted
with the assignment.

The code name of your contact
will be Boris.

Your code name will be...

Natasha?
<i>No.</i>

Doris.

Pricks!

You son of a bitch. Did you think
you could elude us forever, Carlos?

Wait! You got the wrong guy.
My name's Simon.

Just let me go.
There's no need to kill me.

I haven't seen your face...

Don't! I didn't see it!
I didn't see it!

It's you!

Hey, you still interested
in that 'Vette at all?

Hey, Carlos.
The game's over.

Your career as an international
terrorist is well documented.

No!
Oh, yeah!

I sell cars.
That's all!

Come on.
I'm not a terrorist.

I'm actually a complete coward.
If i ever saw a gun i'd... Oh, God!

Oh, please, don't!
Don't kill me!

I'm not a spy.

I'm nothing!
I'm navel lint!

I have to lie to women to get laid.
And i don't score much.

I got a little dick.
It's pathetic.

Oh, God.

Would a spy pee himself?
Huh?

Please, i'm not worth a bullet.

Have mercy, sir.
Get the fuck out of here.

Just beat it.
Go on.

As soon as i turn,
you're gonna shoot me!

You're gonna shoot me!

Please! You can have
the car for free.

What do you say, huh?

Get lost, dipshit.

So last night must've been
pretty exciting for you.

My flat tyre?

Actually, it was a little scary...

because the tow truck driver
took such a long time.

I'll get it.

Hello?

<i>Doris?</i>

Yes?

<i>Listen carefully.</i>

In exactly one hour,
go to the Hotel Marquis.

<i>and dress sexy.</i>
What?

No, no.
Turn around.

Do it <i>doucement.</i>

Do it very slowly.

You've reached a new
all-time low.

I can't believe you're crazy enough
to use the suite at the Marquis.

Do you think i can afford
a suite like this on my salary?

<i>Is Jean-Claude done yet?</i>
Hang on.

Who wrote this shit? Harry?

It's going great.

Do you have an envelope for Doris?

This is Doris.

Listen, you are
a prostitute named Michelle.

Go to the room.
There will be a man there.

<i>He is a suspected arms dealer.</i>

Now, wait a minute.

You don't expect me to, uh,
you know.

No. He has particular tastes.

<i>He likes to watch.</i>

Tell him that his regular girl,
Carla, is sick.

<i>If he likes you,</i>
<i>he will tell you what to do.</i>

You must plant the bug...

<i>near the telephone by the bed</i>
<i>before you leave.</i>

If you do not
complete your mission...

the deal is off.

I'm gonna go to hell.
