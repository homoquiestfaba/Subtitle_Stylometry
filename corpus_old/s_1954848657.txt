         <i> Â¶ In my head</i>
       <i> I may not know Â¶</i>

         <i> Â¶ What I feel</i>
       <i> down in my soul Â¶</i>

        <i> Â¶ With my eyes</i>
        <i> I may not see Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ The fire that burns</i>
        <i> inside of me Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ Just stand strong</i>
     <i> and hold on to hope Â¶</i>

        <i> Â¶ Just grab on</i>
  <i> and don't ever let it go Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ When your back's</i>
      <i> against the wall Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ You're not alone Â¶</i>

          <i> Â¶ You know</i>
    <i> I have been set free Â¶</i>

        <i> Â¶ Fear has got</i>
        <i> no grip on me Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ You know I can</i>

      <i> Â¶ A dead man coming</i>
        <i> back to life Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ Just stand strong</i>
   <i> and hold on to hope... Â¶</i>

       Â¶ His love shines
       over evil things Â¶

           Â¶ I'll be
     right beside you... Â¶

       Right beside you!

         Â¶ In this life
      I'll be the knight Â¶

           Â¶ I'll be
     right beside you... Â¶

So I was thinking
maybe you'd come down
to the dealership,

sign a few balls
or something this Saturday.

         Nobody wants
         my autograph, Milt.

You never know, man.
Come on, seriously.

Last time worked out.
Could be a win-win
for both of us.

             ( groans )

Oh, there she is.

          Shots.

              I got this.
              Don't reach
              for your wallet.

All right, man.

       - No, don't reach
        for your wallet.
       - Thank you.

    -<i> ( crowd cheering ) </i>
    - Here you go, sunshine.

Next round's on me,
I guess.

      - ( crowd cheering )
      - Man:<i> Thank you!</i>

    - Oh!
    - Ladies and gentlemen,

       I think there's
       somebody here tonight

  who deserves just a little bit
  of recognition, all right?

      - Uh-oh, here it is.
      - Oh, no.

     Now, it's not because
     he's a regular here
     at Stevie Ray's...

      -<i> ( crowd cheers ) </i>
      - Hmm? Is he talking
       about me?

         <i> ...or because</i>
    <i> he was an All-American</i>
  <i> at Stevenson High School...</i>

   -<i> ( crowd cheers ) </i>
   - True story, true story.

...or even because
he was a Detroit Tiger.

 Milt:
 That's right!
 Oh, yeah!

       - ( Milt laughs )
       - ( crowd cheers )

       Simply because
       it's his birthday.

       Give it up for
       Calvin Campbell.

       - ( crowd cheers )
       - Â¶ He's a jolly
        good fellow Â¶

        <i> Â¶ He's a jolly</i>
         <i> good fellow Â¶</i>

              All:
         Â¶ He's a jolly
        good fellow... Â¶

  - Oh, a cake!
  - Â¶ Which nobody can deny. Â¶

        <i> ( music playing</i>
          <i> on radio )</i>

       <i> ( phone chiming )</i>

Ah, dang it.
Dang it.

Hey, Katie bear.
Hi.

    <i> You said you'd be home</i>
         <i> by 9:30, Dad.</i>

( sighs )
I know. I'm sorry.

Dang it, I'm sorry.

Milt and Frankie,

they wanted to celebrate
my birthday,

so they took me out
for some, uh, dinner

and we just got
a little, uh...

        -<i> You're drunk. </i>
        - No.

( chuckles )
Yeah.

Yeah, not too much
that I can't drive,
though,

if that's what
you're thinking,
'cause I'm good.

Um, sweetheart,
we're gonna celebrate
when I get home, okay?

Hello?

        <i> ( music playing</i>
          <i> on radio )</i>

               ( snickers )
               Oh, God.

              This guy's drunk.
              Look at this.

He's a mess!

        <i> ( door opens )</i>

     Uh, where do you think
       you're going, hmm?

        - It's 11:15.
        - Out with Colt.

       No, no. I told you
       that I didn't want you
       to see that boy anymore.

 Yeah?
 Well, at least
 somebody loves me.

           You are 16 years old.

     I'm 17, Dad.

      What happened to us
 spending my birthday together?

What happened?

I don't know.

      <i> ( car door closes )</i>

     <i> ( car engine starts )</i>

         ( chattering )

        <i> ( kids laughs )</i>

        <i> ( TV playing )</i>

         <i> ( sizzling )</i>

            What time did you
            get home?

      Late.

       - You making some
         for me?
       - Yes.

          I know late.
          What time?

   I don't know.

   Colt won his
   sprint car heat.

 We went out
 to celebrate.

At least I got to celebrate
something with somebody.

    I like my eggs
    over easy.

     Yeah, I want to say
     something about Colt.

         He's like a--

      he's like a fastball
      from Nolan Ryan

           when he was
           in the prime
           of his game.

  - What does that even mean?
  - It means he's too much
   for you to handle.

  Dad, can't we just have
  a normal conversation
  with breakfast?

<i> Yeah, that's fine.</i>

           ( sighs )

                What are you
                gonna do today?

       - Mall and movie.
       - Hmm.

      - I need the car.
      - I'm using the car.

Don't you think it's about time
you got a real job again, Dad?

So we can afford things?
Like, say, two cars?

     -<i> ( skillet clangs ) </i>
     - You know what?

          I'm the dad
      and you're the kid.

    So you don't talk to me
      about getting a job

           or getting
         a second car.

     Do you understand me?

    The other thing about Colt,
    young lady, is that he is
    too old for you.

            And I know
            what old kids want.

        - I know what
          they're after.
        - Okay.

        Are you guys having--
        are you having sex?

                      Really?

     Really, Dad?
     Really?

( laughs )
You are such
a freaking hypocrite.

I can have
all the sex I want.

You were obviously
doing it in high school.

                      Yeah.
                      ( sips )

    Yeah, exactly,
    and I don't want you to make

              the same mistakes
              that I was making.

So, I'm a mistake?

             That's not
             what I said, Katie.

          - Wow, Dad.
          - Katie...

   - that's not what I said.
   - Well, you did.

                       ( sighs )

You know what?
Maybe you don't like Colt

because you're just jealous
he's an athlete on the way up

and you're... you.

 -<i> Â¶ My heart holds a question</i>
 <i> </i> between every beat... Â¶
 - Dexter, how are you?

      <i> Â¶ Got every answer</i>
       <i> beneath my feet Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ Fallin' apart,</i>
    <i> but I never know why Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ Walked every road</i>
  <i> but the one that's right Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ Been chasin' my tail</i>
     <i> instead of my dream Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ Life's just a game,</i>
  <i> but you play it for keeps Â¶</i>

        <i> ( vocalizing )</i>

  ( Calvin sighs )

        - ( screeches )
        - Ooh. Whoops.

                <i> ( groans )</i>

                <i> Hey, Produce,</i>
                <i> uh...</i>

     sorry, pal,
     I think I just trampled
     on one of your vegetables.

A tomato is a fruit.

        What'd you say?

   A tomato is a fruit.

So are avocados,
cucumbers, and olives.

         -<i> All fruits. </i>
         - Huh.

            Well...

         that's pretty good
         information.

     - Thanks.
     - You're pretty smart.

     - You think I'm smart?
     - Uh... sure.

Do you want to see
how smart that I am?

                    ( sighs )

              You know what?
              Maybe another day.

             I'm just-- I'm not
             really in the mood
             for it today, man.

      - Sorry about that.
      - Okay.

       Have a magnificent day.

                    ( chuckles )

                      All right.

  Hey, Miss Amy,
  how you doing?

     Hey, Produce. I'm great.
     How are you doing?

    - Produce:<i> Incredible. </i>
    - Amy:<i> Nice to see you.</i>

            Produce:
       <i> Nice to see you.</i>

              Amy:
    <i> Look what I'm getting.</i>

          Mr. Campbell,
          you over there
          messing with Produce?

          - Excuse me.
          - Oh, sorry.

        Just having
        a conversation
        with him, Colt.

                 I'm sure it was
                 compelling.

              You know?
              All right, see ya.

    But also putting
    strawberries on the top
    of waffles.

      - Amy:<i> Look at you. </i>
      - Produce:<i> Okay.</i>

  - What else is fresh today?
  - Tomatoes are fresh.

( gasps )
They look good.

              Hey, Produce,
              uh, thank you for
              that information

          over there
          about the fruits
          and vegetables and...

                 You're welcome.
                 My mama said

        -<i> those are not</i>
        <i>  good for you. </i>
        - This?

      ( chuckles )
      Well, your mama sounds
      like a smart person, too.

           - Thanks.
           -<i> Yeah.</i>

Could be good advice.

            Could be good advice
            if I followed it.

        Hey, he's a s--
         uh, you know?

        - The hugging.
        - He's a hugger.

              What's that about?

It's just his way
of being friendly.

             Yeah.

          I'm Calvin.

     Amy.

               It's nice
               to meet you, Amy.

  Nice to meet you.

         Would you like
         to have somebody
         to help you shop more?

      Please help me shop.

    Â¶ And I found the beauty
     that I couldn't see Â¶

     Â¶ And it's everything
            I want Â¶

      Â¶ And so much more Â¶

            Â¶ You Â¶

     Â¶ It was always you. Â¶

                     Yeah!

     Thanks, man.

             That was beautiful.

<i> Thank you.</i>

<i> It still needs</i>
<i> a lot of work,</i>
<i> but I appreciate it.</i>

          Look... there's no one
          here, Frank.

      I could really use
      an extra hand cleaning up
      in the back.

Laura,
I'm not the janitor.

                 I know, but...

          Hey, buddy,
    it was a beautiful song.

                It got me.

         <i> They're lucky to have</i>
         <i> you here, Frankie.</i>

      What's this?
      She forget her broomstick?

        She left that
        for me.

    Got work to do.
    I'll see you later, man.

You didn't leave me
any coffee.

        You know how to work
        the coffeemaker, Katie.

 No, you drank
 it all, Dad.

There's none in the bag.
That's what I'm saying.

         Well, I will--
         I will run to the store

          and get some more
          when I'm finished
          with my paper.

     Hey, Dad?

<i> How about</i>
<i> we go see a movie</i>
<i> or something later?</i>

      I'd love to, Katie,

      but I think I have to meet
      Milt and Frank later.

                  Sorry, kiddo.

            Produce:
       <i> Hi, Mr. Campbell.</i>
 <i> How you doing this afternoon?</i>

    I'm fine.
    How are you?

              I'm doing good.

       Even when I'm doing bad,
       I'm doing good.

   ( chuckles )
   Sounds pretty deep.

   - ( clicks tongue )
   -<i> Have a magnificent day.</i>

  You know what?

       Um...

  I wasn't being honest
  with you, Produce.

    I'm not fine.

             Well, are you sick?

     - I don't think so.
     - Maybe you just need
       to smile.

            "A cheerful heart
            is good medicine."

    Where'd you get that?
    A bumper sticker?

             <i> You told me</i>
             <i> that I was smart.</i>

          - Remember?
          - Yeah.

            You wanna see
            how smart I am?

           Uh...
           ( coughs )

         Well, I'll tell
         you what.

       Maybe not today,
       because I gotta...

       ( clicks tongue )
       I gotta...

     - Pick up that melon.
     - All right.

         They label all of these
         fruits and vegetables

               with some numbers
               on them.

          But I know
          the number on the top
          of that melon.

          - Okay, go.
          - 4329.

  Yeah, 4329.

That's correct.

That's impressive, Produce.
Good job.

                Pear. Anjou.

                    4422.

 Yep. Correct.

            Banana.
            That's the easy one.

        Everybody likes bananas.

                       4011.

       <i> Gala apple. 4135.</i>

                Orange. 9669.

               Tangerine. 3144.

             Granny Smith apple.
             4017.

       Yeah.
       There we go.

    ( clears throat )
    I'm really impressed.

I mean, you're kinda like
"Rain Man" or something.

        Like Superman or Batman!

  Oh!

             Ow.

           You're proud of me
           'cause I'm smart.

   - I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell.
   - No, that's all right.

    He didn't realize
    he was bugging you.

  What did I tell you
  about hugging the customers?

     Now you get back
     to work, young man.

      You have a nice day,
      Mr. Campbell.

   - You, too, Dexter.
   - I'm sorry about the hug.

Nah, like I said.

Hey, Produce.

I'm impressed.

          - Frank?
          -<i> Hi, Susan.</i>

        Is Milt here?

             Is everything okay?

          ( sighs )
          Yeah, yeah,
          it's good.

        I just need
        to talk to him.

  Yeah, come in.

    - You doing all right?
    - Yeah, nice to see you.

          - You, too.
          - Milt.

    - Hey, buddy, what's up?
    -<i> What's up, man?</i>

     - What's up?
     - You doing all right?

               Yeah.
               What's going on?

   Okay, um...

there's no easy way
to ask you this, so...

 - Okay.
 - I need to borrow
   some money for a hotel room.

It's not long.
I'll pay you back.

        - What happened?
        - I got evicted.

   - Hadn't paid in a while,
    so kinda had it comin'.
   - ( exhales sharply )

        Well, you're not getting
        in any hotel, all right?

       You stay here, all right?
       We got plenty of room.

     - You're like family.
     - Man, I--

      No, no, no, no. Stay here.
      We got plenty of room.

   ( clears throat )
   So I got some towels
   if you want to take a shower

     and help yourself
     to anything in the kitchen.

     Thank you.

                 You're welcome.

        <i> ( music playing</i>
          <i> on radio )</i>

No. Colt, hang on.

      What?
      What's going on?

Just slow down.

         The hell are you doing?

      I'm cold.

               Come on, take
               that jacket off,
               get back in bed.

    You know how many girls
    wanna get with me right now?

               But here I am.
               I'm trying to be
               faithful to you.

  I just want it
  to be special

 for my first time.

        Wait, you-- so you're--
        you're a virgin?

      - Yeah.
      - But you said
        that you've been--

    I know.
    I-- I lied.

I just wanted you
to like me, so I said it.

          ( sighs, laughs )

           This is awesome,
           you know that?

        Listen, I got some wine
        out in my Jeep, okay?

         It's in a box,
         so we don't need
         an opener or anything.

    - That's special, right?
    - You don't get it.

     No, you don't get it,
             Katie.

           You can't just tease
           a guy like this.

           I said just lay
           back down.

        <i> ( door opens )</i>

        I just wanted
        to come say good night.

           ( laughs )

                    Wha-- hey.

            What are you doing
            with your jacket on
            in your bed, huh?

           Hey, what's wrong?

    ( clatters )

           Is there something
           I can do to help?

    Please get out.

              Okay.

        <i> ( door closes )</i>

 Hey, Mr. Campbell.
 How you doing?

  - ( laughs )
  - Where's the shopping cart?

       I don't know.

     I'm not here to shop.
       ( clears throat )

     I guess I just, uh...

I guess I just
came to talk.

          - To me?
          - ( laughs )

      Yeah, to you.

      I guess I could use
 some of that magical happiness

        that you always
         seem to have.

So, what's your secret?
It's no secret, Mr. Campbell.

       Well, you're doing
        something right.

          You're doing
     a heck of a lot better
        than I'm doing.

            Do you think that
            I'm smart enough
            to do anything?

           Anything in the whole
           wide world?

   - Well, come on.
   - Uh, where are we going?

( sighs )
All right.

  Where--

where are we going,
buddy?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look it.

I'm not authorized personnel.
I can't go back there.

           Please, Mr. Campbell?
           Come-- please?

     - Come on.
     - ( sighs ) All right.

      - Come on.
      - What are we doing?

What? What is this?

      I'm not smart enough to be
      the Employee of the Month.

                      Oh, shoot.

                  Yeah, you are.

  - Really?
  - Let me ask you a question.

          Do you think that Colt

                 can name every
                 fruit number

         on every piece of fruit
         in the store?

    But I can name
    all the vegetables, too.

                  ( laughs )
                  Yeah, exactly.

               That's my point.
               He can't do that.

                   Hey, Produce.

                 Sometimes...

            well, sometimes life

                    is not fair.

                       You know?

          And sometimes we don't
          get what we want.

        What do you do for work?

           ( laughs )

         Well, uh...

        I've done--
        I don't know,

          I've done
          a few things

         here and there.

          I used to play
          baseball.

                       Wow!

           Will you show me how?

     Well, you know,
     I haven't-- whoa,

I haven't played baseball
in a long, long time, Produce.

       I've always wanted
       to play baseball.

<i> You really want to learn</i>
<i> how to play?</i>

             Yeah!

         Okay.

This is what
I want you to do.

             I want you to stand
             over this box.

          That's the home plate.

     And then you're just going
     to swing this broomstick

       like it's a baseball bat.

                 Hey, Produce?

          Not<i> on</i> the box.
          Over the box.

          There you go.
          Just stand like that,
          okay?

            <i> All right, Produce,</i>

    I just want you to keep
     your eye on the ball.

  - Produce:<i> It's an orange. </i>
  - That's very perceptive.

        Just swing when it comes
        near you, all right?

<i> All righty then.</i>

I'm going to hit
a home run!

               Well, not if
               I strike you out
               first, kid.

                    <i> You ready?</i>

          Here comes the heater.

          -<i> ( thuds ) </i>
          -<i> Oh!</i>

       -<i> It's all right. </i>
       - Strike one.

               <i> It's all right.</i>

             Here's what I want
             you to do.

        I want you to keep
        your shoulders in, okay?

               Keep your eye
               on the orange.

      And I always want you
      to look for the rotation
      of the pitch

                at its highest
                point, okay?

              That's when
              it's leaving my--

                  never mind,
                  just...

       - just swing away
        and have fun.
       - Okay.

              Oh, yeah, Produce!

                <i> Highest point,</i>
                <i> all right?</i>

          -<i> ( thuds ) </i>
          - Oh! Close.

                    All right.

            There we go.

         <i> There it is!</i>
         <i> ( clapping )</i>

        -<i> There it is. </i>
        - ( laughs )

     Here comes a tomato.
     Keep your eye on the ball.

    - Ooh.
    - All right, here we go.

            Boom!
            There it is!

  ( imitates ball whooshing )

             <i> Nice!</i>

           ( laughs )
         Oh! All right,
          there we go.

       ( laughs, claps )

         - Oh, no!
         - Grapefruit.

       Yeah!

        <i> ( door opens )</i>

         Produce!
         Where the heck
         have you been?

 Get a new apron
 and get back to work!

            Hey, Produce,
            how's it going, man?

       - Incredible, man.
       - That's great.
         That's great.

      Listen, if you tell anyone
      what you just saw,

          there's gonna be
          some problems for you.

But you took the bottle.

       - It's not yours.
       - I know.

              The thing is,
              I'd pay for it
              if I was 21,

               but I'm not,
               so I can't.

         - Understand?
         - Understand.

    - All right.
    - Man:<i> Hey, speed demon.</i>

      - Mr. Jenkins,
        how are you, sir?
      - Great, great.

Hey, I caught your race
last Saturday night.

       - Oh, thank you.
       - So when are they
        gonna go ahead

and just let you race
in the 500?

         ( both laugh )

            Oh, thank you, sir.
            You're too kind.

Well, keep up
the good work, son.

You're making us all
proud around here.

         Thank you, thank you.

          Hey, not a word,
          you understand me?

      - Yeah.
      - All right, great.

      - Hey, Produce.
      - Hey, what are you
       doing out here?

  I was wondering if you wanted
  to go somewhere with me.

      Where do we
      want to go?

            Come on.
      It'll be a surprise.

       <i> ( music playing )</i>

     <i> Â¶ Don't need to worry</i>
          <i> 'bout me Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ I've got everything</i>
           <i> I need Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ To be free from</i>
    <i> all ya other ballers Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ And when I bust out</i>
         <i> this groove Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ You'll see the room</i>

   - Dang it!
   - Calvin:<i> It's all right.</i>

         <i> You just need</i>
        <i> to concentrate.</i>

  You need to keep
  your eye on the ball.

 And I want you to put
 your elbows in.

  Okay, transfer
  your weight back.

 The swing
 is all in your wrist.

     -<i> ( pitching machine </i>
     <i> </i> clanking )
     - Let's see.

                ( sighs )
                I'm never gonna
                hit a baseball!

    You're gonna
    hit a baseball
    and be positive!

If you keep telling yourself
that you're never gonna hit
a baseball, guess what.

    -<i> I won't hit it. </i>
    - That's right, exactly.

Baseball is 75% mental.

     Trust me.

          I remember you hitting
          that two-run double

         off of Clemens
         back in the 2000 ALCS?

   Do I know you?

               Steve.

                Bookerson.

     I was out
     of the league
     by 2000.

                    Oh.

           Right, it was, uh...

                   '99.

        Hey, Produce,
        try to swing level.

     Do you ever think about
     getting back into the game?

                Nope.

   Well, that's a shame
   because I'm the assistant GM
   of the Louisville Bats.

 We're looking to fill
 our manager's position and
 I'd like it to be a local boy.

      You know what?
      I got a kid at home
      that I can't handle.

   I don't think I want to be
   in charge of 30 more.

       Look, you were one
       of the smartest players
       I had ever seen back in--

         Hey, don't you
         get it, Steve?

    I wasn't as good as you
    or everyone like you
    thought I was.

  I couldn't hack it
  when it counted and
  I don't want to relive that.

Okay?
So thank you,
but no, thank you.

     I just wanted to offer
     you the opportunity
     if you wanted it.

      It's a good-paying gig.

       But if you got
       other stuff going on...

     Not really.

    Look, why don't you
    stop by the stadium
    Sunday evening 6:00 PM.

        Sunday at 6:00?

        The GM, he'd be excited
        to meet you and if you
        don't like it...

      - Okay.
      - ...you can
       always walk away.

           Yeah, I'll--
           I'll be there.

                          Great.

          I'll count on it.

             Hey, you ready?

      Hmm.

       <i> ( music playing )</i>

I had a good day
today.

            I took this--
            this kid who, uh...

            I don't know, he's--
            he's, like, slow
            or whatever.

     - You know?
     - Slow or whatever?
      Like slow like what?

    - Like can't win a race?
     Or slow like retarded?
    - ( Frankie laughs )

            Yeah, no, he's got
            Down Syndrome.

              I don't know.
              It was a good day.

         He's a happy kid.
         He's a good, happy kid.

      - Yeah, great.
      - That's good, man.

       You know what would
       make me happy?

         - If you buy--
         - ( laughter )

     How about you buy
     a round of beer?

   That'd make me happy.
   How about that?

                    Katie:
                   <i> Colt. Colt!</i>

       ( car horn honks )

      <i> ( Produce grunts )</i>

   - What are you doing?
   - Stay out of this, Katie.

 - Boy: You need my help, bro?
 - No, man, I think I got it.

              Hey!

         Hey, where do you think
         you're going, huh?

             Katie:
   <i> What are you doing, Colt?</i>

       Stay out of this, Katie.
       It's got nothing to do
       with you.

        Listen, man, I told you
        to keep your mouth shut.

               I got fired today
               'cause of you.

    - You did something bad.
    - What?

           What exactly
           did I do to you?

                   Huh? Nothing!

                I did absolutely
                nothing to you.

I came to give
Mr. Campbell a melon.

                 ( scoffs )

                This melon?

        You came to give
        Mr. Campbell this melon?

 Produce:
<i> Yes. Don't break</i>
<i> Mr. Campbell's melon!</i>

         Katie:<i> Colt!</i>
        <i> Leave him alone, Colt!</i>

      Can't you see
      he's different?!

        All right, man,
        you know what?

        Take your melon.

          Come on, guys,
          let's get out of here.

           ( car engine starts )

     Produce.

      <i> ( car door closes )</i>

                   <i> What are you</i>
                   <i> doing here?</i>

Where's Katie?

        She left.

          I brought you a melon.

       I see that.

       Um... that was
       nice of you.

       Does your mama know
       where you are?

               You don't like
               my melon?

            Aw...

    ( sighs )
    That's not it
    at all, Produce.

   - Thank you for the melon.
   - You're welcome.

              So... why are you
              all dirty?

                Did you fall
                off your bike?

        - Yes.
        - Are you hurt?

          - No.
          - You okay?

            - Yeah.
            - Okay.

                   Well...

                   um...

                do you want
                a ride home?

      - You smell funny.
      - Yeah, it's, uh...

         that's what the French
         call<i> eau de Bourbon.</i>

                    ( laughs )

                    Not funny?

                  ( chuckles )
                  Okay.

               Well, I'm gonna
               go, uh, to sleep

               'cause it's
               real, real late

          and, um, I'll see ya
          tomorrow or whenever.

        - Good-bye.
        - Hey, Produce?

                   Hey.

                 Thank you
                 for my melon.

You're welcome.

              And away he goes.

           Oh, he-- Produ--
           ( clears throat )

            Produce, you forgot
            your--

                     hey--

      <i> ( birds chirping )</i>

   <i> ( footsteps approaching )</i>

        Hey, Katie bear?

   Which, uh--
   which tie do you
   think I should wear?

     This one
     or this one?

    - ( chuckles ) Neither.
    - No?

             No, you're not much
             of a tie guy.

   Yeah, I guess
   you're right.

                  Why are you
                  so dressed up?

             Ah, I got that
             meeting tonight.

        ( sighs )
        The owners of the Bats,
        you remember?

        - Oh, yeah,
          that's right.
        - Yeah.

     - That's awesome, Dad.
     - Thanks.

So just call me after
and we can grab dinner
to celebrate.

            Yeah, okay.

        - I'd like that.
        -<i> Me, too.</i>

    - Well, all right, then,
     it's a date.
    -<i> Okay.</i>

                All right.

     <i> ( Produce, muffled )</i>
         <i> Mr. Campbell!</i>

     You should tell your
     mentally challenged friend

           not to come
           around here anymore.

    Produce?
    Why?

     - Colt says
      he's a troublemaker.
     - ( laughs )

He's not a troublemaker.

Colt on the other hand...

    -<i> ( knock on door ) </i>
    - Can you open the door
     for him, please?

            Dad, Colt is gonna
            be here any minute.

Yeah, I don't care
about Colt.

          Okay, well,
          just make it quick.

             - Hi.
             - Hey.

       - Is that for me?
       - Yes, it is.

                     Oh.

       - Thanks.
       - You're welcome.

    I got them from
    the flowers department

      and they've got
      plants there, too.

              Oh, I'm gonna go
              put them in water.

            - Okay.
            - Okay.

               Yeah, he's a real
               troublemaker.

      - Hey, big guy.
      - Hey, Mr. Campbell.

        - How you doing?
        - Incredible.

       - That's good.
       - I left my book
        here last night.

    -<i> And I really need it. </i>
    - Yes, you did.

             It's exactly
             where you left it.

    - Here you go, big guy.
    - Thank you.

            Hey, you look sharp.
            Where you going?

  Thanks.
  I'm going to church.

 It practically starts
 in 17 minutes.

      - Practically, huh?
      -<i> Look at my watch.</i>

    My mama told me

it has all the whistles
and all the bells.

          Yeah, well, I think
          your mama's right.
          It looks like it does.

     - It's a beautiful
       timepiece, Produce.
     -<i> Thank you.</i>

Uh, do you want to come
to church with me?

                    No.

        <i> ( car pulls up,</i>
         <i> horn honks )</i>

It's been a long time
since someone got
me flowers.

       - So, thank you.
       - You're welcome.

             Hey, Produce,
             let me ask you
             a question.

            What do you think
            of that boy?

            Produce:
         <i> Well, I think</i>
         <i> he's arrogant</i>

and I would love
to give him a karate chop.

              ( laughs )
              Me, too, boy.
              Me, too.

             All right,
             have a good Sunday.

Uh, well, I don't
want to be late.

  If I ride my bike,
  I'll be late.

  Can you please
  give me a ride?

  - Please?
  - But I've got to go
   play golf with my friend.

       And then afterwards
       I got a real big meeting.

    - So...
    - I know-- I know that.

I do understand that,
but I need a ride, please.

   Give me a ride,
   please.

                    ( sighs )

          All right, what time--
          how-- how--

              all right, just...

Calvin:
Now I'm gonna drop you off,
but I'm not going inside.

Your daughter
is extremely sweet.

                      Yes.

     I just wish she came
     with an instruction manual.

Produce:
Why would she come
with an instruction manual?

      - ( siren chirps )
      -<i> ( Calvin laughs )</i>

   <i> ( police siren wailing )</i>

                     Oh, crap.

      - Ah, man.
      - What's the matter,
       Mr. Campbell?

                   Uh, nothing.

I had some drinks
this morning.
Damn it!

                  ( sighs )

               Do you have any--

    Hey, Mr. Officer.

  - Hi, Calvin.
  - Hey, Mitch, how you doing?

                    Good, good.
                    What's, uh--

              Wha-- what's going
              on here?

Uh, well...
( clears throat )

I'm just, uh--

I'm just teaching
the boy how to drive.

          - Uh-huh.
          - You know?

And he's doing
pretty great.

He's just-- he's going
a little fast.

( whispers )
He doesn't know
any better.

                    Yeah, right,
                    I-- right.

               ( clears throat )

                     Well, uh...
                     ( sighs )

Encouragement helps.

         All right, uh,
         you're-- you're doing
         a great job here, son.

       - Thank you.
       - You're welcome.

     Just slow it down.
     Speed kills, remember that.

   Okay. Speed kills.
   I'll remember that.

             Speed kills.

          ( clears throat )
          All right.

  - You boys have a nice day.
  - Calvin:<i> All right.</i>

       - Produce: Thanks.
       - Be careful.

Thank you, Officer.

  ( both sigh )

 Calvin:
<i> Good job.</i>

<i> Good, good.</i>

  - I think you better drive.
  - ( sighs )

  Well...

you're about
to drive a car.

       <i> ( music playing )</i>

      Go.

Calvin:
Real slow.

Keep your eyes
on the road.

               I've never driven
               a car before.

   - I only have a bicycle.
   - Well, you're doing good.

      This is incredible!

     Hey, uh...

   so I'm gonna be
   a little late.

Yeah, something came up.

I gotta take
somebody to church

   and it's taking
   a little longer
   than I thought.

 Yeah, I'll see ya.

    - ( horn honks )
    - All right, all right.

        <i> ( chattering )</i>

  You can't get past me.
  You can't get past me.

      You can't get--
      ( laughs )

          Oh, spoiled!

          Nice!

    ( grunts )
    All right, all the way.
    I got him.

       - Woman:<i> Kick it.</i>
       <i>  Do it. Ah! </i>
       -<i> ( laughter )</i>

           You're coming inside,
           Mr. Campbell?

Uh... next time.

       - Promise?
       - I can't promise.

          <i> Hey, is this</i>
          <i> your secret, Produce?</i>

     It's no secret,
     Mr. Campbell.

                     Huh.

Well, good luck at your
baseball meeting tonight.

       - Thanks, bud.
       - You're welcome.

     - Have fun at church.
     - Thanks.

<i> Huh.</i>

        Huh.

             Milt:
   <i> All right, so who is she?</i>

        Who?

    This friend you've been
    spending all this time with.

             The market, church.

               Who is she
               and can I please
               see a picture?

Oh, it's not a lady.

I've been hanging out
with that kid, Produce.

      - The retarded kid?
      - Hey, easy.

It's called
Down Syndrome.

I'll tell you something,
you spend a second
with this kid

  and you realize
  he's just like
  you and me.

                Milt:
                You're a genius.

     What's guaranteed
     to make people spend money?

     The mentally handicapped--
     challenged, whatever
     you call it.

          That's what I need
          for my new dealership
          commercial.

    Calvin:
    Like you're
    gonna give money

    to the Special Olympics
    or something every time
    you sell a car?

 - What are you talking about?
 - No, you tool bag.

            I want him to star
            in my commercial.
            It's perfect.

Come on, Milt.

     Okay, maybe not him,
     maybe one of his special
     buddies will do it.

  - Hey, conversation's over.
  - Cal.

Come on, man,
sales are down.

Do your old buddy Milt
a solid and call the kid.

He won't know
the difference.

Maybe he'll do it for free.
You know, he's retarded.

                   Hey!

            I said
            it's Down Syndrome.

( laughs )
Okay, what are you--

you feeling sorry
for him?

          No, Milt,
          I feel sorry for you.

   B.S., man,
   you feel sorry
   for yourself.

You've been feeling sorry
for yourself since Detroit
kicked you off the team.

  - What'd you just say to me?
  - You heard every word
   I said.

I'm not gonna sit here
and debate some loser

who can't get over the fact
that he was an embarrassment
in the majors.

What, are you
gonna freeze?

Is your whole life
just gonna freeze?

Just like you did
at home plate?

             ( brakes squeak )

                 Produce:
                 Mr. Campbell!

             Where are you?

            Produce:
             <i> Hey!</i>

      - What are you
       doing up there?!
      -<i> ( Calvin groans )</i>

              <i> ( Calvin laughs )</i>
              <i> Produce,</i>

             you scared me.

             <i> Come on.</i>

       <i> ( Calvin groans )</i>

     Hey, watch your step,
            Produce.

    There's all sorts of...

      <i> There's just stuff.</i>

         Did you drink
         that whole bottle?

            Not yet.

      - Now I did.
      -<i> ( glass shatters )</i>

    ( sighs )

            <i> Are you sure</i>
            <i> that you are okay,</i>
            <i> Mr. Campbell?</i>

I'm okay.
Now that you're
here, I'm great.

I got my drinking buddy.

           Uh, maybe we can go
           to the batting cages

        and be baseball buddies,
        not drinking buddies?

  You wanna be
  my baseball buddy?

         -<i> Yeah, I do. </i>
         - Uh, okay.

    Here.
    First lesson...

( exhales sharply )
...when you make it
to the majors--

  'cause you will--

and you're standing
at the home plate

   and there's
   40,000 people...

   cheering for you,

expecting anything...

  don't forget
  to swing the bat.

                 I know that,
                 Mr. Campbell.

Gah, you knew that.

You know everything, huh?
You're a smart guy.

  - ( inhales )
  -<i> ( train whistle blowing )</i>

Okay, answer me this--

who hit the ball
400 feet on to the roof

of Stevenson High School
when he was a junior?

               Was it you,
               Mr. Campbell?

    Uh, well,
    it wasn't you,
    was it?

      - No, it wasn't me.
      - No, it wasn't you.

    Yeah, it was me.

      It was me.

    I was supposed
    to be great.

           Well, to me,
           I think you're great.

Well, of course you do!

Of course you do.
You think melons are great.

       - I don't like it
        when you drink.
       - You know what?

I don't like it
when you drink

and I don't want to be
your drinking buddy

and I don't want
to be your baseball buddy.
Do you understand me?

<i> I don't want to be</i>
<i> your buddy anymore.</i>
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

I have a meeting
I gotta go to

at 6:00 tonight.

    ( sighs )

It's, like,
a really big meeting...

with really big--
big, important people.

        - ( laughing )
        -<i> ( keys clink )</i>

<i> Hey.</i>
<i> Toss 'em up.</i>

              I don't think that
              you should drive.

   God, toss up
   the keys, Produce.

          <i> I'll call Miss Katie</i>
          <i> to pick you up.</i>

      ( sighs )

     - Produce...
     - I'll call Miss Katie
      to pick you up.

    I'm gonna come
    down there, Produce.

       - No!
       - Co-- come here!
        Come here!

      ( Calvin grunts )

       Ah, man, Produce.

         Produce. Hey!

                Hey!

              Produce!

              Hey.

If I'm late--
I'm walking and if I'm late,

  it's your fault.

It's your fault!

                     ( groans )

             Hello?

     It's Calvin Campbell.
   I'm here for my interview!

        I'm late!

          Oh, come on!
         Open the door!

           Hey. Hey!

            Come on!

          ( panting )

   <i> ( music playing faintly )</i>

       <i> ( phone chiming )</i>

  You were supposed to call me
 right after the meeting, Dad.

            <i> Katie,</i>
    <i> it's Officer Minniear.</i>

     - Is everything okay?
     -<i> Everything's fine.</i>

      -<i> It's, uh, just-- </i>
      - What happened?

        We found him passed out
        in the visitors' dugout
        at South,

     so I need you to come
     down here and pick him up.

       ( sighs )

 ( sighs )
 Here, drink this.

        - Cal, come on.
        -<i> Hmm?</i>

     Drink this.

       - Thanks, Mitch.
       - How you feeling?

              I don't feel good.

                   Katie.
                   ( groans )

 - ( Calvin exhales sharply )
 - No, don't touch me, Calvin!

               ( groans )
               I'm sorry.

This is the single
most embarrassing moment
of my life.

Do you have any idea
what it's like

picking up the man
who calls himself
your father

at the police station
drunk as hell?

       - I'm sorry.
       - No, you're not.

You're not sorry.

You're just
a pathetic little man.

        You're a pathetic
        little man who lives
        a pathetic little life.

   - Calvin:<i> Don't say that. </i>
   - Because it's not true?

              Because
              you know it is.

                      I'm sorry.

           This isn't
      how I wanted things
      to turn out, Katie.

       I just want to make sure
       you know that I've
       given up on you.

Ah, Katie, come on.
Your old man's had
a rough night.

  ( slurred )
  Don't say that to me, Katie,
  'cause you're my little girl.

       - I'm sorry.
       - Get in the car.

                      ( sighs )

                <i> ( door opens )</i>

          ( groaning )

        <i> ( door closes )</i>

        Mitch, Mitch...

             Mitch,

           I'm sorry.

         <i> ( clanging )</i>

                 It's okay.

            You can--
            you can yell at me,

              you can scream
              if you want to.

                I deserve it.

   Why would I do that?

  I already told you
  I've given up on you.

            What can I do
            to make this better?

              You tell me
              what to do, Katie.

                  What can I do?

      Nothing.

Hi, Mr. Campbell.

              Hey, kid.

Did you make it
to your meeting?

              Uh... no.

              No, I didn't.

Yeah, it's probably better
that you did not go.

               You-- you're
               probably right.

<i> So, are you</i>
<i> still mad at me</i>

<i> for taking your keys?</i>

                  No.

   So, are you here
   to shop for groceries?

    Come here.

      I'm sorry.

             Group:
   <i> God grant me the serenity</i>

      to accept the things
        I cannot change,

     the courage to change
       the things I can,

         and the wisdom
    to know the difference.

                Come on in.

 Uh... sorry.

          Hi, I'm Amy,
          and I'm an alcoholic.

             Group:
            Hi, Amy.

           Tonight's meeting
           is a closed meeting.

        Anyone who has a desire
        to stop drinking is
        welcome to stay.

              Any newcomers?

      Uh...

         Please stand up
         and introduce yourself.

       We'd like to welcome you.

Um...
( clearing throat )

( sniffles )
Hi, uh...

My name
is Calvin Campbell.

     And, uh...

      I live here,

      St. Matthews.

           And, um...

              I have a daughter.

                 She's 17.

                   Uh...

              who I--
              I love her more
              than anything.

                  And, um...

          Yeah, that's about it.

      - Amy:<i> Hi, Calvin. </i>
      - Group: Hi, Calvin.

                      Hi.

 Amy:
<i> Thank you.</i>

<i> Um, just for future,</i>

first name only is fine.

That's kind of
the anonymous part.

    And, um...

it's customary to state
that you're an alcoholic.

  That part is...

  self-explanatory.

<i> All right,</i>
<i> tonight I'll be</i>
<i> reading from step three.</i>

<i> to turn our will and lives</i>

Do you love me,
Colt?

              You don't love me.

  Why would you
  even say that?

         If you loved me,
         we'd be in the backseat

          right now
          and I'd be hitting it.

      - ( Katie sighs )

    Prick.

                ( scoffs )
                What did you
                just say to me?

      - Nothing.
      - All right, get out
       of my car, Katie.

     What?

              I'm not doing
              this baby stuff
              with you anymore.

                 I'm over it,
                 all right?
                 Get out.

   - You know what?
     You are a prick.
   - Yeah, and you know what?

          You're not hot enough
          for me to be trying
          this hard anymore.

                 Get out.

    - Yeah.
    -<i> I-I would have called</i>
    <i>  someone else, but...</i>

  - I'm behind the Valumarket.
  -<i> What are you doing there?</i>

       Well, Colt wanted
      to go somewhere that
       we could be alone.

        I-- just please
          come get me?

       Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

           I'm coming
     to get you right now.
      I'll be right there.

                   ( shivers )

      -<i> Hey, Miss Katie. </i>
      - Hi, Produce.

     I probably look silly
     just standing out here
     all by myself in the dark.

     Are you cold?

                 Yeah, but won't
                 you be cold?

           No.

                 ( chuckles )
                 Thank you.

      I think you
      look beautiful.

   - Well, you're very sweet.
   - You're welcome.

         Produce, listen to me.
         I need you to go back
         inside, okay?

         Produce,
         go back inside.

   - What are you doing here?
   - No, leave him alone.
    He didn't do anything.

          Listen, I don't
          care about the 'tard,
          I'm talking to you.

          I came back
          to apologize, Katie.

           I'm sorry for
           what I said earlier.

Damn, you drunk again,
Mr. Campbell?

    - You touch
     either one of them...
    - Oh, you'll what?

                            Huh?

            Go home.

  - Katie:<i> We're over, Colt. </i>
  - ( scoffs )

                    Colt:
                   <i> Okay. Fine.</i>

            Have it your way.

     -<i> ( car door opens ) </i>
     - Hey.

     -<i> ( car door closes ) </i>
     - Thanks for coming.

              Calvin:
              I'm trying, Katie.

         - I'm trying.
         - I know.

         - Thanks, Dad.
         - And you...

             ( chuckles )
             thank you

         for protecting
         my daughter.

You're welcome.

             I wish there was
             something we could
             do to repay you.

 - Â¶ Oh, oh, oh, I'm so glad Â¶
 - Â¶ That troubles don't Â¶

     Â¶ Troubles don't last
            always Â¶

       <i> - Â¶ I'm so glad Â¶</i>
       <i> - Â¶ I'm so glad Â¶</i>

     -<i> Â¶ Troubles don't Â¶ </i>
     -<i> Â¶ Troubles don't</i>
     <i>  last always Â¶</i>

Â¶ O Lord, what should I do? Â¶
Â¶ O Lord, what should I do? Â¶

       <i> Â¶ I said that I--</i>
     <i> I'm certain that... Â¶</i>

  We're gonna leave
  in a couple of minutes.

           So what did you guys
           think of the service?

         Well, I mean,
         she liked it.

      She was smiles
      and, uh, I liked it.

             Think you guys
             will make it back?

              I don't know.
              You know?

        It's been a long time
        since I've darkened
        the doorway of a, uh...

      - ( clicks tongue )
      - Of a church?

      Yeah, of a church.
      ( chuckles )

       I just-- you know.

  I haven't had much faith
  in anything in a long time.

                    I hear you.

       - Yeah.
       - How's everything
        else been going?

             Um...

       One day at a time.

                   That's right.

  Hey, um, can we--

can I take you
to get some coffee or...

      - Um...
      - Yeah. ( chuckles )

    - ( laughs )
    - Yeah, you got coffee.

       - Hey, Katie.
       - You ready to go?

      I am.
      Uh, Katie,
      this is Miss Amy.

             - Hi.
             - Hi.

      - Nice to meet you.
      - It's really nice
       to meet you.

I've heard
a lot about you.

       Oh, well,
       hopefully all good.

      - Sometimes.
      - ( scoffs ) Thanks.

     - Definitely all good.
     - Thank you.

                  Okay.

          - Okay.
          - All right.

    - Bye. Nice to meet you.
    - Nice to meet you, too.

        - Come on, Dad.
        - Come back.

     - We will.
     - I'll see you later.

You swing with
your club face open.

         What do you know?
         You swing a club worse
         than you swing a bat.

          Did you just come here
          to mock my golf game?

I came here
to apologize.

         Cal, the things
         I said to you, man,
         everything I said--

     Hey, what you said
     was true and I needed
     to hear it.

             ( Calvin growls )

   - Milt: Missed you, buddy.
   - I'm sorry.

          - I'm sorry.
          - I'm sorry.

     - You should be sorry.
     - It was a cheap shot.

                ( laughs )

Let's get out of here.
Let's get a beer.

            How about we make it
            a coffee?

          - A coffee?
          - AA.

You're not
an alcoholic, Cal.

                     I am.

              I'm an alcoholic.

          Okay, happy hour.
          Two for one.

  - Two for me, none for you.
  - ( Calvin laughs )

   - Hey, Dexter.
   - Hey, what's up, Calvin?

                How you doing?

            So today is the day
            that you announce

           the Employee
           of the Month, right?

     - Yeah, why?
     - Well, um, have you
       considered Produce?

 - He's a hard worker.
 - Now, Cal, I have a soft spot

     - in my heart
       for that young man.
     - Yeah, I know.

That's why I hired him
the first time.

           He's a good boy.
           He's a good guy.

Now-- now, look, Cal.

Now, Produce ain't got
the sense God gave a cucumber.

 - ( inhales sharply )
 - Now, I gotta give that award
  to employee that represent

what this supermarket
is about.

This ain't no YMCA
where everybody
gets a trophy.

            Okay, and with
            all due respect,

   I think that Produce is
   probably the hardest-working
   employee that you have.

   I mean he knows
   the name and the SKU number,
   the code or whatever

   to every piece of fruit
   and vegetable over in your...

    - Now, Cal.
    - ...section over there.

Just because the boy's
a retard, he don't get
no special treatment.

       - You know better
         than that, man.
       - You know what?

      We don't use the "R" word
      just like we don't
      use the "N" word.

          - You know?
          - ( sighs )

     We should be clear
     on our word choice, Dexter.

          ( Calvin sighs )

     Let's get out of here.

                     Hey.

              Wanna go have
              some fun?

              Hmm?
              Let's go.

Well, do you guys wanna
hit the go-karts?

 - Go-karts? Do we?
 - Yeah! I'll do the go-karts.

     We were made to hit
     the go-karts, Produce.

                      Made.

                  <i> Born to ride!</i>

       <i> ( music playing )</i>

  <i> Â¶ Good morning, sunshine Â¶</i>

  <i> Â¶ It's nice to see you up Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ Once in a while Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ It's 12:00 already Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ The city bus is gone,</i>
      <i> you're late again Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ But I'll give you</i>
           <i> a ride Â¶</i>

  <i> Â¶ I know you don't like it</i>
 <i> when I tell you how to live Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ But something's</i>
         <i> gotta give Â¶</i>

   <i> Â¶ Life, love, and pain Â¶</i>

   <i> Â¶ Life, love, and pain. Â¶</i>

             There you go.

    ( groans )

You're making this
hard on me, Milt.

             Come on,
             don't be soft.

( sighs )
They call that enabling.

           It's called testing.
           Good job, you passed.

             These are actually
             both for me.

Where's your family at?
Franklin's dropping them off.

            - Hmm.
            - Yeah.

     - We're playing house.
     - Hmm.

     All right,
     give me a sip.

  - Really?
  - Yeah, just a sip, a taste,
   to knock off the edge.

                 Are you sure
                 about this?

       One sip.

    I've been
    real, real good.

      -<i> ( beer splashes ) </i>
      - Ah, come on.

            I may have lost
            my drinking buddy,

      but I still gotta look out
      for my best friend.

          Besides,
          the beer was terrible.
          Tasted stale.

           - Did it?
           - No.

            I just remembered
            I had this.

      ( scoffs )

    I don't want
    a sip of that.
    ( clears throat )

                  Produce:
                  Yeah.

             Look who we found,
             Mr. Campbell.

  Produce wanted me
  to come have pizza
  with him.

              Um...

    - Amy.
    - Hi, I'm Milt Malcolm.

Hi. Nice to meet you.
How are you? Nice to meet you.

   - ( whispers ) Nice work.
   - ( laughs )

        Oh, cavalry has arrived.
        Excuse me, folks.

See ya, buddy.

All right, come on,
let's go.

          - Let's go.
          - Come on.

          ( chatter )

         I'll be right there.

Thank you so much.

<i> It means a lot.</i>

I-- I'm sorry.

   Milt.

             Milt!

         ( car beeps )

          Listen, that--
          that wasn't anything--

I'm not listening to you!

    - You're killing me.
      You're killing me!
    - ( car engine starts )

      Katie:<i> Hey, Produce,</i>
      <i> you want to go play</i>
          <i> some games?</i>

            - Yeah!
            - Yeah?

        - Bye.
        - See ya later.

         - Amy: Wait...
         - Ha.

     -<i> Wait... </i>
     - We just got ditched.

                    ( chuckles )

             Yeah, I think
             your daughter just
             stole him from me.

        - Hi.
        - How you doing?

        Ah.

I'm good, yeah.

          - ( sighs )
          - Nice.

 Come on,
 go get a pizza.

    - ( gasps ) Pizza.
    - Talking your language?

           That's unique.

    ( laughs )

          I know how to do this.
          I love laser tag.

      - ( girl chuckles )
      - Thanks.

Hey! We're on
the same team, remember?

 Hey, Katie.

                  ( gun shoots )

            Come on.

    - I wanna play.
    - No, we can play later.

 Colt:<i> Come on, guys,</i>
<i> it's the last game</i>
<i> of the night.</i>

 Then we can
 come back tomorrow.

         We're on the same team,
         remember?

               I'll protect you.

( screams sarcastically )

          Oh, my gosh,
          you got me, man.
          ( laughs )

<i> Come on, guys.</i>
<i> It's just a silly game</i>
<i> of laser tag.</i>

       - Come on, Katie,
        let's beat 'em!
       - Let's go.

     -<i> ( lasers zapping ) </i>
     -<i> ( music playing )</i>

    ( children chattering )

                 ( chuckles )

   - What?
   - What do you need to be
    so rude for, Katie, huh?

  - What does that mean?
  - Remember? Remember you
   used to say you loved me?

     - No, Colt.
      What are you doing?
     - Once upon a time.

I just wanna talk, that's all.
Okay, well, I don't
 wanna talk.

Yeah, you don't need to talk.
No, you need to put
 your hands off me.

      No, no, listen, I just
      want you to lay back down
      right now.

      - That's it.
      - You're disgusting.

       - Disgusting?
       - No, my dad was
        right about you.

         - Oh, my God.
         - Stop!

        - Stop! Get off!
        - Shh!

    - ( muffled screaming )
    - This would be easier
      if you just...

  <i> ( continues indistinctly )</i>

    - Hey, I shot you guys!
    - Boy: Get out of here,
      Produce.

   -<i> ( muffled screaming ) </i>
   - No! Is that Miss Katie?

    - Get out of here!
    - Colt:<i> Shut up, Katie!</i>

             - No!
             - Now!

     <i> ( muffled screaming )</i>

    - ( muffled screaming )
    - Shut up!

    - Will you shut up?
    - ( muffled screaming )

    - Shut up.
     Ah, come on, shut up!
    - ( Produce growls )

            - Dad!
            - Yeah?

          Dad, please come help.
          Hurry!

What's wrong, baby?
What's wrong?

            Produce hit Colt
            and it's really bad.

Amy:
What?

Oh, no.

<i> Hey, should you</i>
<i> call 911?</i>

      - Amy: Yeah.
      -<i> ( Calvin groans )</i>

     What did you do,
     Produce?

  - You're not proud of me?
  - No, I'm not proud of you!

       You cannot hit somebody
       with a fire extinguisher!

          I mean, are you--
          are you crazy?!

I thought we'd be
like brothers!

         You go call your mom
         right now!

         And you bring her here,
         Produce.

  - Ah...
  - Dad, it wasn't his fault.

He was just trying
to protect me
from Colt.

 - Wh-- what do you mean?
 - I don't know what would
  have happened if he didn't--

          - ( crying )
          - Oh, baby.

        - Oh, I'm sorry.
        - ( sobbing )

              I'm sorry.

Calvin:
Now is he gonna
be all right?

          Once he gets treated,
          we'll take him in

      and interview him,
      find out a little bit
      more about what happened.

       - Okay.
       - Where's the kid?

          <i> Obviously, we'll need</i>
          <i> to talk to him.</i>

We don't know.
Um, he just took off.

           <i> Okay, I'll send</i>
           <i> some officers to--</i>
           <i> to go look for him.</i>

  Is he gonna
  be in trouble?
  Produce?

           I don't foresee that.
           I think it's, uh--

         we just need to ask him
         some questions.

    <i> Find out a little bit more</i>
    <i> about-- about what went on.</i>

    All right,
    well, it's my fault,
    so I'm gonna get in the car

       and I'm just gonna go
       look for him.

   All right,
   I'm gonna stay here and see
   if I can get ahold of him.

   - Okay.
   - Okay, I'll go with you.

     - Thank you, Officer.
     -<i> Certainly.</i>

      - Let us know if you
        find out anything.
      - Absolutely.

        We can't just be
     driving around blindly

   looking for him all night.

      - We have no choice.
      - Yeah, we do.

             I think I'm gonna
             take you home.

                Maybe just wait
                for him there.

            Maybe he'll show up
            at the house.

No, he's not gonna
show up at the house, Dad.

And I'd rather be
with you right now.

        <i> ( music playing</i>
          <i> on radio )</i>

       <i> ( phone chiming )</i>

         What does Milt want?

          Hey, buddy boy,
          what do you need?

  Let's meet up, man.
  Let's meet up.

    <i> No, I can't right now.</i>
    <i> Katie and I are looking</i>
         <i> for Produce.</i>

 -<i> We're just driving around. </i>
 - I talked with him.

  -<i> Can't do that right now. </i>
  - Frank, he said he wasn't
   sleeping with her.

    -<i> ( tires screeching ) </i>
    - She wanted to.

I believe him, man.
Oh, jeez!

       <i> ( tires screech )</i>

  <i> ( crashing through phone )</i>

Hey! Milt?

Hey, answer me!
Milt!

   Hey. Hey, Amy.

           Hey, is Produce okay?

( sighs )
No, not good.

     - Are you his father?
     - Uh, no. Uh-uh.

Dr. Jones wants to speak
to his next of kin

to discuss what's going
to be happening today.

All right,
we'll call his mother.

              No, she died
              over a year ago.

      What?

  He talks about her
  all the time.

             I know.
             I'm-- I'm so sorry.

             I thought you knew.

<i> Ho-- ho--</i>
<i> hold on a second.</i>

So you're telling me
that he lives all on his own?

Even-- even with his--
with-- with his condition?

                       Yeah.

           Does that
           really surprise you?

    The patient with DS is--
    really wants a book
    or his book...

             You know what?
             Let me talk to him.
             I'll talk to him.

I'm sorry.
I'm only allowed to have
family back there.

    - Amy: Please.
    - Ma'am, we are the only
     family that he has.

    - Okay? Amy, do you mind
     sticking with Katie?
    - Amy: Yeah.

     - I got it. Thank you.
     - Calvin:<i> Where is he?</i>

            Thank you very much.

                       Hey. Hey.

             Oh...
           ( sighs )

        ( voice cracks )
          Hey, buddy.

How you doing,
Produce?

Hey, Produce,
how you doing?

        - Hurts so bad.
        - Yeah.

I bet you do.

Hey, I just wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

Okay?

Back at that
laser tag place,

I-- I realize you were
just trying to protect Katie.

I just wanted
to say thank you.

                You're welcome,
                Mr. Campbell.

 Milt:
<i> I'm sorry, Cal.</i>

   - I want to have my book.
   - You want your book?

                    Yes.

     - You want your book?
     -<i> Yes.</i>

    Oh, you want your book!
  I'm gonna go get your book.

             I'll be right back.
             Hey.

         Your wife's on her way.

        - Hey, darling.
        - Hey, Dad.

   Hey, sweetheart,
   will you run to the car
   real quick

 and grab Produce's Bible
 for me?

    - Hi. How are you doing?
    - I'm fine. Fine.

          - You okay?
          - I'm fine.

      I just saw Milt.
      He looks good.

He's gonna be all right.
Wanna go back and see him?

     Actually, um, I'm not sure
     he wants to see me.

            Okay.

   I mean, I think--
   I think that he would
   wanna see you.

       You sure?

        You know, I don't wanna
        get him all worked up.

            - Okay.
            - So...

         Okay. Okay.
         You okay?

                    Yeah.
                    ( crying )

      Hey, here's the book I got
      that you asked for.

 Produce:
<i> It's not for me.</i>

     What are you--
     what are you talking about?

                   It's for him.

   We're looking at blunt trauma
   to the left upper abdomen,

   ruptured spleen,
   severe internal bleeding,
   and hypertension.

                 Should I order
                 an exploratory
                 laparotomy?

No time.
Make sure we're prepped
for a splenectomy, stat.

I don't wanna lose
this kid.

                        Okay.

         Mr. Campbell.

     Calvin:
    <i> You're gonna be</i>
    <i> all right, kid, I promise.</i>

Please don't leave me here.

      Hey, I'm right here,
             Milt.

I'm right here, pal.

Look what the kid
gave you.

( chuckles )

       - He's a good kid.
       - Yeah.

       - I'm scared, Cal.
       - Hey, hey.

You're gonna be
all right.

              <i> ( Milt sniffles )</i>

         My mom used to do that
         back when I was a kid--

            read me the Bible.

         I used to like Matthew.

           I can't remember why.

           Hey, Sue?

     Come on.

            ( monitors beeping )

     All right.
     Huh? Pick up.

( reading prayer )

"...who are weary
and burdened.

and I will give you rest.

<i> Take my yoke upon you</i>
<i> and learn from me.</i>

  -<i> For I am gentle</i>
  <i>  and humble in heart..." </i>
  - Nurse:<i> We need to get him</i>

      <i> - into surgery now.</i>
      <i> - "...and you will</i>
      <i>  find rest..."</i>

      Give me another set
      of retractors.

      I see some bleeding
      in the left kidney.

  ( monitors beeping rapidly )

                 Get two units
                 of blood, stat!

        - More suction!
        - ( slurping )

    -<i> ( saw buzzing ) </i>
    - There you go.
     Bring that in closer.

        <i> ( heart monitor</i>
       <i> beeping rapidly )</i>

       <i> ( phone ringing )</i>

            Hey, thanks.

 What did you say?

       - When?
       - When you prayed.

          ( chuckles )

            I don't know.

I said a prayer, too.

That was the first time
I've actually prayed.

               Yeah?

             Me, too.

I-I asked that
Milt and Produce
will be okay.

        - Do you think
         it'll happen?
        - I hope so.

            I hope so.

        But I don't know
        if that's the way
        it works, sweetheart.

Well, then, what good is it
to pray if you don't get
what you ask for?

               Okay.

       Growing up, did I get you
       everything that you
       ever asked for?

        - Of course not.
        - No.

              But I love you
              so much

              and I want you
              to have everything
              that you want,

          but sometimes it's not
          in your best interest

      or it's just, uh--
      it's just a hard decision.

            It's not fair.

          I'm saying that God...

      is probably not a genie...

       you know, that's granting
       every wish or...

               I don't know.
               I don't know.

 Maybe you're right.

     I hope that you get
     what you asked for tonight.

    Thanks, Dad.

 - ( monitors beeping rapidly )
 - He's crashing! Come on!

Doctor, get that
off of the paper.

     <i> ( bone saw buzzing )</i>

         Get two units of blood!

          ( slurping )

            Probing.

Where's the CO2?

     ( monitor flat-lines )

              Man:
           <i> You know,</i>
  <i> it's in moments like these</i>

         <i> I'm reminded</i>
    <i> of one profound truth.</i>

        <i> Life is short.</i>

   And it's meant to be lived
          with courage

    and not laden with fear.

         <i> And you have to decide</i>

    <i> are your dreams bigger</i>
      <i> than your memories?</i>

       <i> Or will you stay</i>
      <i> stuck in the past?</i>

   Life is meant to be lived.
       Lived abundantly.

      You know, you look around
      this cemetery, you see
      there are--

         there are two dates
         on every tombstone.

   There's a birthdate
   and there is a date of death.

       <i> Every human being</i>

         <i> is guaranteed</i>
       <i> those two dates,</i>

     <i> but that little dash</i>

     <i> that lies in between</i>
      <i> those two numbers,</i>

      <i> that's what defines</i>
           <i> our life.</i>

   <i> So make your dash count.</i>

             <i> Live.</i>
         <i> Really live.</i>

      <i> ( birds chirping )</i>

      <i> ( crowd cheering )</i>

           Announcer:
     <i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
         <i> let's welcome</i>

            <i> our new</i>
   <i> Louisville Bats manager,</i>
       <i> Calvin Campbell,</i>

  <i> who will now take the mound</i>
 <i> to throw out the first pitch.</i>

       ( crowd cheering )

              Wow.

       I want to dedicate
        this first pitch

           to someone
     very important to me,

 uh, who's not able to be here
   with us tonight because...

            well...

         his life ended
         way too soon.

           Produce...

       can I have a ball,
            please?

      <i> ( crowd cheering )</i>

     Yeah! Ha-ha!

     That's my boy!
     Ha-ha!

     - Knock 'em down, man.
     - Thanks.

           This one's for Milt.

          ( cheering )

      <i> ( cheering louder )</i>

        <i> have you been?</i>

       <i> ( music playing )</i>

                 I don't know.
