It's a shame Nick couldn't come.

He did say I could go out with you.

He said it was all right.
As long as I looked after you.

Did he now?

Well, I didn't want him thinking we were
going behind his back or anything.

That's a bit presumptuous,

Why?

I might not have wanted

Tony Wilson's over there.
Who?

Posh bloke from Granada TV.

Oh, yeah.
One day he'll be recognising me.

You'll have to be out a bit more.
Yeah.

Been a bit busy.

Getting married, finding a house.

Sounds like fun.

How's the band?
Yeah. Not bad.

It's not particularly good
either, is it?

No. We're pretty shite.

Be a lot less shite if we could find
a singer who could sing.

I'm really looking forward
to seeing this lot tonight.

Apparently they tear up the stage
and kick off mid-set.

All right?
Gotta go.

Apart from watching telly?
Hmm, having breakfast, lunch and tea.

Food? Well, that's a start.

There's plenty ofjobs
that involve food.

And watch telly.

So you like food and watching telly?
That's right.

Well...

There's a job here working
at Knutsford Cinema

How does that sound?

I do not like hot dogs!
OK.

Well, should we give 'em

We were Warsaw.
Now we're Joy Division.

Excuse me, but what happened
to Slaves of Venus?

OK.

All right. Joy Division's good.
Joy Division, eh?

What's all that about?

It's the name of a brothel German
soldiers used during World War II.

Well, whatever. Studio's yours.

And it folds up to hold the record.

Have a look.

Yeah, it's good that, Bernard.

Thought-provoking.

That's right. Her name's Corrine Lewis.

Is 2.45 Thursday all right?

OK, then, Mr Mathers,
she'll see you then.

Done. He sounds keen.

I'd never stand for that.

What?

Being called something like
"the Buzzcocks".

What are you on about?

I don't know. I don't mind the Buzz,
but calling themselves Cocks.

I don't get it.

They're not calling themselves
the Cocks, are they?

They're calling themselves
the Buzzcocks.

Still got the word "cock" in it, though.

Just saying I wouldn't stand for it,
that's all.

Shh!

We've just been on telly, lads.

So is Tony Wilson a fan,
then, or what?

That was bollocks.

He didn't even say if he liked it
or anything.

'Course he liked it.
Well, how do you know?

He waved it
in front of camera like that.

Forget the record.
He's got to put us on.

Hiya.



Go on, tell him.

OK, how are you?

You're gonna go out there,
it's all gonna be fine.

You're not up there having a wank, OK?

Think.

You're a twat, you are.
You're a bastard.

Am I? Why is that?

Because you haven't
put us on television.

Well, then, you'll be the next band
I'll put on, darling.

[man and Hooky argue]

Fuckin' right we're going on
before your band, twat!

Your band ain't even
a real fuckin' band.

Fuck off.
Hooky'll do your head in.

Fuck off!
[puffs breath]

[# <i>Digital]</i>

That was superb, that, lads.
It really was.

I've not seen a reaction like that

since George Best got kicked out
for blasting a bouncer.

I know how you can be better...
like that.

Go on, then.
Simple. You employ me.

You play, I manage.

We all get stinkin' rich and go buy
fuckin' great big houses in Cheshire.

Job's a good 'un.
And who are you?

Rob Gretton. I already manage
a couple of bands.

But they couldn't sniff the sweat
round your bollocks.

You lot are somethin' else.
I hold my hands up.

I am a believer in Joy Division.
Fuckin' hallelujah.

I'm also resident DJ here,

which means I know anyone of any
music biz use anywhere in this city.

I'll have you lot signed within
the month. In fact, I guarantee it.

We've already got a manager,
haven't we, lads?

Who's that, then?
Fuckin' me.

What's your name, mate?
Terry.

Terry what?
Terry Mason.

Terry Mason. Tez.
You mind if I call you Tez?

Tez, you know jack shit about this
business. Wanna know how I know?

'Cause I haven't heard of you.

I bet you haven't even got
a fuckin' telephone, have you?

Didn't think so. How will you book gigs

and cut deals without a phone,
you daft cunt?

No offence. I call everyone that.

Look, I've got to pack up my gig.
Ring me.

[telephone ringing]

[clears throat]

Rob's Records, Rob speaking.

All right, lan. Yeah, good, yeah.

Well, that's fuckin' brilliant, lan.

Well, I'll speak to you later, then.

Fine, I understand.

But you've got to sign with Factory.
This isn't an issue.

We're a fresh and exciting label,
you're a fresh and exciting band.

And, most importantly, we both fly
the flag for the Republic of Manchester.

Don't give a fuck about that.
I'm a royalist.

And I suppose they're Nazis as well.
We're not Nazis.

What about the money?
It's 50<i>l</i>50 on the profits.

You own all the publishing rights
and can walk away at any time.

You serious?
Rob...

I don't fuck about with talent
I want to work with.

I'll even sign the contracts in my
own blood if it'll make you happy.

We'll speak later, then.

Now remember, we are live,
so no swearing or they will cut you off.

What about "arse"?
What?

Is "arse" a swear word?
"Arse", yes. It's a swear word.

No, it's not.
Bernard,

out there I know
"arse" isn't a swear word.

Here, in TV land,
"arse" is most definitely a swear word.

Trust me, I know
all about swearing and TV.

I'm a master of knowing
when I can and when I can't.

What about "big dog's cock"?
Can you say that?


No.

Seeing as how this is
the first television programme

which brought you the
first appearances from everyone

from The Beatles to the Buzzcocks,
we like to think we bring you

the most new and interesting sounds
in the North-West.

They're called Joy Division,
a Manchester band

except for the guitarist who comes from
Salford. A very important distinction.

This is called <i>Transmission.</i>

[# <i>Transmission</i>]

I can't believe you did it.

Must have lost about half a pint.

Shows he's serious, though.

How you feelin', Tony?
Mmm.

I've felt better.

Hold on. You spelled Morriss wrong.
It's supposed to be double S.

Tony, you're gonna have to add
another S to this, kid.

Do I have to?

It's not very professional to spell
the drummer's name wrong, is it?

Job's a good 'un. Thanks, Tony.

So...

...I can officially announce
to the press

Joy Division have signed with Factory?

Can you fuck? I'll give you a ring
and arrange a proper meeting Monday.

He's fuckin' scared of playing
London for the first time.

Chocks away.

Well, that was shit.

First gig in London,
there's nobody there.

And now I'm freezing.

I told you it's broke.

Well, you're probably just too thick
to work it properly.

It's a heater, lan.
You turn it on and it heats up.

And that one doesn't, 'cause it's broke.

Give us a go on your sleeping bag.

I'm dying here.
Ten minutes. I'll give you it back.

No.
Don't be so spoilt.

I'm not. I'm dying!

Fuck, I thought he was just
trying to warm himself up.

This isn't right, this, Rob.

[buzzer sounding]

What's the story, then?
He's had some kind of fit.

Oh, right. They're clever,
these doctors, aren't they?

What kind?
Epilepsy. They're not sure.

I thought epilepsy
was only for head-the-balls.

What?
Head-the-balls. Spaccas.

Nice, Hooky, nice.

So is he gonna be all right?
He's not said a lot.

Well, if he were chatty we'd be worried.

Is that beautiful?

Some of it.

Some of it, yeah, but...

...some of it's
not meant to be beautiful.

Does anyone believe in love?

I believe in pure... sex.



You know, like if I had a car,

and I felt love for the car
and somebody kicked my car.

I'd be as upset as if
they kicked my girlfriend.


So you're not a journalist, then?

It's a hobby thing, not a full-time job.

I work for the Belgian embassy,
for the chancellor.

Sounds interesting.

Free, independent woman.

I suppose so, yes.

Tell me about Macclesfield.


I've wanted to escape it my whole life.

What about your wife?

She loves it in Macclesfield.
