NARRATOR:
<i>Since the dawn of time...</i>

<i>... storytellers have enchanted</i>
<i>audiences with their words.</i>

<i>But there is an even rarer gift:</i>

<i>There are those,</i>
<i>who by reading out loud...</i>

<i>... can bring
characters to life.</i>

<i>Out of books and into our world.</i>

RESA: Go to sleep now. Shh.
Go to sleep, baby girl.

Maybe this will work. Let me read to her.
RESA: She's too young.

No.
Shh.

Why don't you read to me?

"Once upon a time,
there was a dear little girl...

...who was loved
by everyone who met her...

...but especially by her grandmother,
who would've given her anything.

Once she gave her
a little hood of red velvet."

What was that?

What?

I don't know. Nothing.

"Red velvet that suited her so well...

...that she refused to wear
anything instead of it.

So she was called
Little Red Riding Hood."

<i>Most of these Silvertongues,</i>
<i>as they are known...</i>

<i>... prefer to keep their skills a secret.</i>

<i>But some do not even know</i>
<i>that this gift is theirs...</i>

<i>... until it is too late.</i>

MO: Is this the right way?
MEGGIE: Next turn on the left.

MO: Are you sure?
Because I think we missed it.

Who's the driver? Dad.

Who's the navigator? Me.

Have I ever got us lost before?
No.

No.

Oh, hey. Look, a Sasquatch.

Hey! Oh, the turning, left, left, left!

The Alpine Antiquarian Bookshop
should be at the end of this street...

...and on the right-hand
side of the square.

Good.

By the way, how come every bookshop
we go to is a thousand years old?

Why can't we go to one...

...that sells hot chocolate
and books that are actually new?

What good would a bookbinder
like me be in a new bookstore?

I love old books. The marbled pages...
End papers, the leather binding...

This is my kind of place.

Maybe you'll find it here, Mo.
Find what?

That book you're always looking for.

I'm not looking for anything particular.
MEGGIE: You don't think I've noticed?

You never leave a bookshop unless
you've checked every corner.

Don't we?
No, you always come away disappointed.

Sometimes your eyes
are even a little red.

It's because old books are dusty.

Hey, look, <i>Harriet the Spy.</i>

I'm going inside. You want to come?

<i>- The Secret Garden!</i>
Or I guess you could stay here.

[BELL RINGS]

Afternoon. I'm Mortimer Folchart.

Ah! The famous book doctor.

Well, you're just in time.

Look at this poor patient.

Uh-oh.
Do you think we can save him?

I think the prognosis is good.
Excellent.

Quite the collection you have.
Yes.

If you'd like to look around, be my guest.
Thank you.

VOICE 1 [WHISPERING]:
<i>Fine, intelligent eye.</i>

<i>What do you say to calling him</i>
<i>Black Beauty?</i>

[VOICES WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY]

VOICE 2:
<i>Oh, my dear child.</i>

VOICE 3:
<i>Imagine, Heidi.</i>

VOICE 4: <i>Capricorn's men were looking</i>
<i>for Dustfinger in the wrong place.</i>

VOICE 5:
<i>Southwest end of Treasure Island.</i>

VOICE 4:
<i>He hadn't left the village.</i>

<i>He hadn't even tried.</i>

<i>Dustfinger was in Basta's house.</i>

VOICE 6: <i>What is that? Coming over</i>
<i>the hill? It's a beast of some kind!</i>

Dustfinger.

He doesn't like to be tickled.

And you should be more careful.

His name's Gwin.

And I know he looks charming...

...but you know what they say
about books and covers.

Uh... Yeah, I do.

I also know what they say about
talking to strangers. Excuse me.

But I'm not a stranger, Meggie.

You won't remember me, we only
met once, and you were quite small.

But I'm no stranger.

Hello, Silvertongue.

I was just having a talk
with your daughter.

Meggie, go wait for me in the van.

It's all right, he's a friend.

Dad.
Do it now!

Let's you and me go for a little walk.

I've been looking for you.

I've been one step behind you for years.

Waiting for you to find what it is
you've been searching for.

Just tell me what you want.

I want you to put right
the wrong you did nine years ago.

And I'm here to warn you,
Capricorn knows where you're staying.

His men are there now waiting for you
and your daughter to come home.

He wants you to read for him.
Well, he's out of luck.

I don't read aloud anymore.

If he finds you, you really think
you'll have a choice?

I could help you stay hidden,
but I won't.

Not unless you promise to send
me home. I've been here too long.

Send me home, Silvertongue.

Read to me.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

It's too dangerous. It's uncontrollable.

DUSTFINGER: If you won't help me,
I'll find someone who can.

Just give me the book.

What book? I don't have the book.

You don't have the book?
No.

I've searched everywhere.
I don't have it.

What's in the bag?

Did you finally find one?

It's funny, isn't it? Strange, my turning
up here right at that very moment.

You know, there are times in life
when the stars just simply align.

MO:
But this is not one of those times!

MEGGIE:
Dad!

Meggie!
What's happening?

I told you to stay in the van! Run!

Get in, get in!

Come on. Start!

DUSTFINGER:
Stop! I'm trying to help you!

What are you doing? Leave it alone.
I want to see the book!

You're not to touch that book,
understand?

I don't understand.
I don't understand at all.

What is that book? Why did the
freaky man with the scars want it?

Why did he call you Silvertongue?
I can't tell you.

You have to tell me.
No. I have to protect you.

And your mother.

My mother? What has this
got to do with my mother?

Meggie, please just...

I'm scared, Mo.

Meggie, I'm going to take care of you.

I always have, and I always will.

At least tell me where we're going.

We're going to Italy.

You have a great aunt there. It's
very important that we get there. Okay?

Please, Meggie. No more questions.

So she's friendly,
this great aunt of mine?

MO:
You'll like her.

[BELL RINGING]

WOMAN: Would you please
stop ringing that damn bell!

After a while.
She's kind of an acquired taste.

Right.

What?

Elinor.

Well, for the love of Thomas Hardy.

ELINOR: I'm so glad you've finally made
your way back here, Mortimer.

My poor books
are in a terrible state of disrepair.

Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

Don't play with your food, child.
You're not a toddler.

Look at her, she's as thin
as a soap bubble.

Oh, she so reminds me
of her mother.

Not just when she opens her mouth,
if she ever does. Speaking of...

We haven't heard from her,
if that's what you mean.

Oh, well, no matter.

I grew up without a mother.
Didn't do me any damage whatsoever.

No, my mother just suddenly dashed off
on safari one day and never came back.

It's what the women in our family seem
to do, they just go off on adventures.

Not me, I prefer to stay where I am.

But your mother...

Well, she wanted the real thing.

My mum wanted me.

And then one day she was gone,
without explanation.

Is that what you call an adventure?
No, that's what I call abandonment.

Well done, Elinor.

Oh, well, you know it's the truth.

MEGGIE:
Mum did not abandon us.

MO:
No. No, she didn't.

Well, then what really happened to her?

I'm not a child anymore.
I'm all grown up.

Almost.

Enough to know the most important
thing that's ever happened to me.

Don't you think I've realized
why I'm not in regular school?

And why we're always
traveling around from place to place?

All these years
you've been looking for Mum.

And that book, but I just don't
understand how those two things...

Meggie.

You have to tell me something.

I write about her sometimes.
You do?

Yeah. I make up stories about...

You make up stories? Meggie, you know
I don't want you doing that.

But I have to.

I feel like the words bring her
back to me.

Yeah.

The written word.

It's a powerful thing.

You have to be careful with it.

Do you think we'll ever see her again?

I hope we do, Meggie.

I hope we do.

Step away from that case!
Three steps back!

MEGGIE:
Um, um...

What are you doing?
This place is not for children.

I thought I made that clear.
Come on, out.

I'm sorry, I was just looking
for a book to read.

Is that a nose print?

Do you have any idea
how valuable this manuscript is?

Yes, I know.

Oh, you know, do you?

It's Persian, isn't it?

I can tell from the illuminations...

...the pinks and the blues
and the gold-patterned background.

Maybe from the late 12th century or so?

Goodness me, what a little know-it-all.

It's beautiful.

Yes, it is, isn't it?
But I just adore everything Persian.

You've been to Persia, then?
Yes, a hundred times.

Along with St. Petersburg, Paris, Middle
Earth, distant planets and Shangri-la.

And I never had to leave this room.

Books are adventure. They contain
murder and mayhem and passion.

They love anyone who opens them.

If I promise not to touch anything...

...could I maybe just sit
and read in here for a while?

That was the window seat
where she used to curl up and read.

She?

Your mother.

Your father used to read to her here.

This was hers.

If I find even a bookmark out of place,
I'll lock this room up...

...and you'll never see the inside
of it again, that I can promise you.

[RAINDROPS PATTERING]

VOICE 1 [WHISPERING]:
<i>Then Dorian Gray half opened the door.</i>

<i>As he did so...</i>

[VOICES WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY]

VOICE 2:
<i>Farewell...</i>

VOICE 3:
<i>- trapped inside...</i>

VOICE 4:
<i>- desire of revenge...</i>

I tried to warn you.

I gave you every opportunity
to help me, but you refused.

All you had to do was read me back.
You could have kept the book.

But you had to run.

So I turned to Capricorn.

What?
He's promised to help me.

What have you done?

[GLASS SHATTERING]

Meggie!

There are men outside!
They're trying to break into the house!

MO:
Meggie!

Mo, look out!

Mortimer, my books!

Hello, Silvertongue.

Basta?
Did you miss me?

Stop!

ELINOR: Oh, you illiterate cretins!
BASTA: Hold him!

These are masterpieces
you're destroying!

Masterpieces, you ignorant halfwit!

Stop!
I swear, I'll kill every last one of you!

You know I could!
It would take a few words!

Oh, we won't have to worry about
your words if we cut out your tongue!

You remember my calling card,
don't you?

One, two, three!

If that doesn't work...

...well, there's always your daughter.

Get off me!
No one gets hurt.

Yes, the fire! The fire.

Isn't that what we agreed?
Isn't that what we agreed?

Yes, we agreed, we agreed, we agreed!

Evil spirits, I repel thee.
Evil spirits, I repel thee!

MEGGIE:
Dad! Dad!

Right, get them in the van.

You're not taking them too.
Capricorn's orders.

After all, we are going
to require a little leverage...

...to make Daddy read.

Meggie!

Don't drag my daughter into this.
For God's sakes, she's just a child.

No, don't! No!
What's this?

No.
My only hope of finding my wife.

My only hope of going home!
No!

What is it? When will you
tell me what is going on?

Has your father ever read you
a bedtime story, Meggie?

You might want to ask him why.
Give me this.

I'll take that!

ELINOR:
No!

Oh, my books! No!

FLATNOSE:
Come along, now. Hurry up.

ELINOR:
Oh, my books!

[COCKS GUN]

Come on!

Meggie.

Where are we?

They're here.

MAN:
Hey, they're coming!

Oh, how lovely.

After you.

Come on, out! Out!

ELINOR:
Oh, they're rude!

BASTA:
Move! Move!

[ALARM RINGING]

MEGGIE:
It's ticking.

Flying monkeys.

What is this place?
I don't know.

FLATNOSE:
Welcome to our humble abode.

Enjoy your stay.
Go on!

No, I will not share this filthy hovel
with all those creatures!

MAN 1:
Go on, get in!

MAN 2:
In you go!

ELINOR:
What are we doing here, Mortimer?

[ANIMALS GROWLING]

Where did those monsters come from?

Books.

They came out of books.

What are you talking about?

Mortimer, be quick, be clear,
or I swear I'll disinherit you.

Came out of books? What do you mean?

Come here.

Meggie...

...this is the story
you have been waiting to hear.

Elinor, you were away at a book fair...

...and we were housesitting for you.
Me, Meggie, your mum.

<i>And that night we were in the library...</i>

<i>... so I opened a copy</i>
<i>of a book we'd just bought.</i>

<i>Inkheart.</i>

<i>Inkheart.</i>

MO: <i>It was a good read.</i>
<i>Full of adventure and magic...</i>

...and a creature called The Shadow.
Terrifying.

<i>I read several chapters aloud</i>
<i>and nothing happened.</i>

<i>Then they appeared, out of nowhere...</i>

<i>... from the medieval world of the book.</i>
<i>At first it was Capricorn...</i>

<i>... a thuggish bandit</i>
<i>working for an evil duke.</i>

<i>Then Basta, his knife-wielding sidekick.</i>

<i>And then Dustfinger...</i>

<i>... a traveling fire juggler</i>
<i>with magical powers.</i>

My voice brought them out.

Your voice brought them out
of the book?

And her mother went in.

That's how it works.

<i>Dustfinger saved us</i>
<i>from Capricorn that night.</i>

<i>It was only then that I realized...</i>

<i>... Resa, your mum...</i>

...she was gone.

They'd come out of the book,
and she went into it.

Resa!

And that, Meggie, was the last time
that I read to you.

The night we lost your mother.

Oh, she went into the book.

Oh. Goodness sake, Mortimer!

All these years you've allowed me
to think the worst of Resa!

Why didn't you tell us?
Would you have believed me?

You want to read Mum
back out of the book.

That's why you've been searching
for <i>Inkheart</i> all these years.

If she's alive, you mean.

You say she's trapped in that book.
How do you know?

Who's to say she got there? If she did...

...how could she survive for nine years
if the monsters are anything like those?

Or worse.

How do you know where she is?
Or if she's alive, even.

How do you know?

It's like the illustration in the book.
Kind of scary.

It's hideous. The man's got
no taste whatsoever.

Look, will you stop pushing me!

Meggie, just pretend that you're in
a book. Children always escape in books.

No, they don't.

Remember <i>The Little Match Girl?</i>

They found her in an alley
frozen to death.

Walk.

Ah.

Come in.

We saved you the good seats.

MO:
Capricorn.

ELINOR:
Uh! I told you to stop that!

Please.

You got old.

You got a castle.

Indeed, I did.
And a haircut.

A lovely castle in a secluded part
of the country...

...far from prying eyes.

Oh, yes, I've adjusted rather well
to your world, don't you think?

This must be your daughter.
So much life to live.

You, however, are a noisy old bag.

You make a racket
without opening your mouth.

You barbaric piece of pulp fiction!

Your malice is matched
by your stupidity!

I don't know how things are
in that third-rate novel of yours...

...but where I come from one
does not go around ravaging libraries!

My life's work, destroyed
by a bunch of unread, solecistic thugs!

I have no patience
for old women with big mouths.

You know my reader.

Darius, why don't we show our guests
what I have been up against?

Read that.

But you said...

...I wouldn't have to read
once he got here.

when I said that?

[MEN LAUGHING]

Read the book.

"Rapunzel had splendid long hair.

It was as fine as spun gold.

And when she heard..."

[WOMAN YELLING]

Help! No!

Help!

[MEN LAUGHING]

You see?

Look at the writing on her face. She's
only been half read out of the book.

Take her to the dungeon.
RAPUNZEL: No!

And give her a haircut.
RAPUNZEL: No!

I'm not going to read out loud,
if that's what you're intending.

Not with them in the room.
Bring the girl up, please.

You take your...

Here's how this will work: You'll
do exactly what I tell you to do...

...or I'll kill the old lady and lock your
daughter up for eternity. Is that clear?

Great. Well, let's get things started,
shall we?

This is a great book, filled with riches.

Reading out treasure?

For now. Someone has to pay for repairs,
and all the locals have been bled dry.

I'm warning you. I have no control
over what comes and goes.

I have no idea what's going to happen.

Well, this should be fun, then.
Let's give it a whirl.

"Kasim gazed upon the treasures
within the cave.

Mountains of gold and silver
were heaped from floor to ceiling.

Piles of silks and sacks of jewels.

Kasim gathered all the treasure
he could carry...

...only to find
the door of the cave sealed shut.

And by the will of Allah...

...he'd forgotten the password.

He cried out, 'Open Barley!'

But the door did not budge. Kasim named
every grain of wheat he could think of.

'Open Buckwheat!' 'Open Millet!'

But still the door would not open.

Then came the sound
of approaching hooves."

[HOOVES PATTERING]

Sand.

"Kasim ran to hide, but tripped,
sending coins spilling in every direction.

Then came the muffled call of
'Open Sesame!'

And the cave opened...

...to reveal
a most unpleasant collection...

...of bandits."

What?

You see?

BASTA:
Yes! Yes!

That's how it's done!


Look! What'd I tell you?

Put that boy in the stable and feed him
to the ticking crocodile.

But if he came out, who went in?

Help.

Help.

It's my turn now.

It's my turn now.

Just like you promised.

Your turn?

Oh, you mean this.

It's an incredibly rare book, this. We've
been tracking them down for years.

I can't send you back.
I don't know how.

Send us back?

Why would we ever want to go back...

...when your world
is so accommodating?

With your telephones
and your guns and...

What's that sticky stuff called?

Duct tape.
Yes, duct tape.

I love duct tape.

Besides, what was I in <i>Inkheart?</i>

The Adderhead's henchman.

Living in the woods
with all those filthy beasts.

But look at me now.

I've got a castle.

I'll never go back. None of us ever will.

To make sure of that, I'm going to
do what I always do...

...when someone digs up a copy
of this tedious book.

You promised I'd be sent home.

Yes, I know. I lied when I said that.

I mean, I'm a liar.
I lie all the time. Lie, lie, lie.

After all these years,
you'd think he'd figure it out by now.

No!
No!

Get it! Get it out!

No!

Must you do that every single time?
It's pathetic, honestly.

Don't!

Now, get your burns tended to.

Otherwise, I'll be forced
to cancel our Juggle Night.

You know how much I look forward
to Juggle Night. Lock them up.

Hey, Darius. Don't forget to feed
the crocodile, will you?

Oh, for the love of Theseus!

No, no, no. He didn't mean it.

He's just hungry.
It's not his fault.

He's a Minotaur.

thanks to Darius and his reading.

COCKERELL:
A lot is down to this jackass.

We came out with half the book
tattooed across our face. Look at my eye.

[IN NORMAL VOICE] If you think
that's bad, look at the state of my nose.

It's disgusting.
Ye... All right.

So you can imagine how pleased we are
that you're here.

Delighted. Because now we got someone
who can really read.

I hurt myself.

Again.

I don't understand it.

In <i>Inkheart,</i> my hands,
they never burned.

But here!

Fire has no sense of humor.

You're trying to escape again?

Resa...

...give up.

We're not going anywhere.

For a moment...

...I held <i>Inkheart</i> in my hands.

But it's ashes now.

And I shall never go home.

But you...

...you still have hope.

When Darius read you out of Inkworld,
he left your voice behind in that book.

But if you could talk...

...would you tell me your story?

Would you?

No.

No, you wouldn't. It's because of how
I'm written, isn't it?

You think me weak and deceitful.

It's not all I am.

Not all of me.

It's just a dream.

It's just a dream. It's just a dream.

Are you all right?

What's your name?
My name is Farid.

Are you one of the 40 thieves?
Stop talking to me.

Don't you know it's bad luck
to speak in a dream? You stupid girl.

You talk in a dream,
you never find your way back.

"Stupid"?

You're the one who thinks you're in
a dream. I was just trying to be nice.

Go back to your muttering
and see if I care.

It's just a dream. Just a dream.

Come home.

Please come home.

Good morning.

Thank you.

How can I ever repay you?

Resa, even if I could find you a key,
where would you go?

This is your family?

This is your husband?

Your daughter?

You went in the book when I came out.

You went in the book...

...when I came out...

...and then Darius read you out again.

Gwin.

I'm gonna get you out of these chains,
and then you're going home.


I'll meet you at the stables.


I've never been that in control before.

I know I can get Resa out of the book.

And maybe send Capricorn back in.

We just have to find another copy.

Well, it only took you nine years
to find the last one.

I bet the author has a copy.

If he's alive, I bet he'd have one.

Someone must know where he lives.

Great. Now we're going to
have to try to escape, aren't we?

Either that, or get fed
to the ticking crocodile next door.

MO:
Someone has to stop him.

Before you say anything,
I'm here to save your necks.

After putting them on the chopping block
in the first place?

Listen, you want your wife back as much
as I want to go home to my family.

You think there's another copy of
<i>Inkheart</i> out there, let's find it together.

And how do you intend that we escape?

Page 14.

The mighty storm?

MAN 1: Get in the castle!
MAN 2: Let's go!

MO: <i>"From the far north they heard</i>
<i>a low wail of the wind...</i>

<i>... and Uncle Henry and Dorothy</i>
<i>could see...</i>

<i>... where the long grass bowed</i>
<i>in waves before the coming storm.</i>

<i>'There's a cyclone coming, Em.</i>
<i>I'll go after the stock. "'</i>

Good doggies.

<i>"Suddenly, Uncle Henry stood up."</i>

MAN 3:
Get out of the square!

<i>"He ran toward the sheds where</i>
<i>the cows and the horses were kept.</i>

<i>Aunt Em dropped her work</i>
<i>and came to the door.</i>

<i>One glance told her</i>
<i>of the danger close at hand.</i>

<i>'Quick, Dorothy! Run for the cellar!"'</i>

There she is! Come on!

<i>"A strange thing happened.</i>

<i>The house whirled around two or three</i>
<i>times and rose slowly through the air.</i>

<i>Dorothy felt as if</i>
<i>she were going up in a balloon. "

That should do it!

MAN 1:
Let's get out of here!

Must've run off!

MAN 2:
Help me!

Come here! Let's go.

MAN 1: Come on!
MAN 2: Straight on!

Come on!
MAN 3: Get them!

Come on, get up!

MO:
You were right.

<i>Mo!</i>

DUSTFINGER: Gwin!
<i>- Meggie!</i>

ELINOR:
Meggie!

MAN 1:
Look! Hold on! Hold on! Wait, hold on!

MAN 2:
Don't move!

DUSTFINGER:
Watch out!

<i>Dustfinger!</i>

MEGGIE:
Where are we going?

<i>Don't leave me!</i>

The prisoners!

They're escaping!

MO:
Run!

MEGGIE: Hurry, get in!
MO: Run, run!

Get in, get in!

MEGGIE: Get the keys, hurry up!
DUSTFINGER: Take all the keys!

MO: Which one?
DUSTFINGER: The one with the nine!

DUSTFINGER:
Wait, wait, wait, Gwin!

Come on, Gwin.

Come on! Okay, go, go!

Hold on!

MEGGIE:
Watch out!


Still think you're dreaming?

FARID:
Well, what else could it be?

We're flying.

Or is it the night flying past us?

MO:
He lives in Alassio.

ELINOR:
Which way is that?

MO: South.
ELINOR: South?

Can't you be more precise?

Beats a camel, huh?

ELINOR:
Farid.

Oh, hooligan.

Farid, some clothes for you.
You'll freeze to death otherwise.

Apparently this is the place.

Man in the fishmonger's says he lives
in an apartment over the square.

Good. Great.

Oh, I'm not coming.

What do you mean? You have to come,
otherwise he won't believe me.

DUSTFINGER: Oh, I don't know.
You can be pretty persuasive.

MO: Huh?
You talked me out of a book.

The book is right here within our grasp...

You're afraid.

You've never read <i>Inkheart,</i> have you?

DUSTFINGER:
What's there to read?

I've lived it. Except for the end,
and I've got no interest in that.

Well, why not?

Do you know the end
of your story, Meggie?

No. And I suspect you wouldn't want to.

It'd be like turning
to the last page of a mystery.

Where's the fun in that?
Well, I think I know the end of my story.

MO: Hm?
I'm going home.

Why?

I'm sorry. It's just all too real for me.

I prefer a story that has the good sense
to stay on the page where it belongs.

No, I have to get back to my
poor, desecrated books.

I want to mend them, put them in order.

I'll do that. Let me...
Here's some money for you.

You see, I've already bought my ticket.

Goodbye.

Good luck.

Elinor...
Let her go.

ELINOR:
Don't catch cold.

Bye, then.

Here it is. This must be it.

That's it.

What? Oh.

Signor Fenoglio?
Yes?

Sir, my name's Mortimer Folchart.

I'm Meggie.
My daughter.

I want to be a writer too.
You do?

Yes. Give me something to write with.
Be quick, I've got a cake in the oven.

You look like you've been taxidermied.

If you want an autograph, give me a pen.
We don't want one.

You don't want an autograph?
No.

Then why in the name
of Chaucer's beard are you ringing?

Well...

Dustfinger's in the piazza, we just
escaped from Capricorn's village...

...and you won't even believe
what Basta tried to do.

What?

Come home.

Please, come home.

A good story, I'll give you that.

Silvertongues is a wonderful concept.
Wish I thought of it.

Too absurd to take seriously.

I know my characters are so believable
that they seem to leap off the page.

But it's simply not possible.

Exactly as I imagined him.
