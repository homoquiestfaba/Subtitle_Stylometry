A belief in a supernatural
source of evil is not necessary,

men alone are quite capable
of every wickedness...

Joseph Conrad, 1911.

Oh, my God.
How did it come to this?

¶ Bitch slap ¶

How are you feeling,
sweetie?

I'm fine.
My noggin is still a bit throbbin'.

Fuckin' nothin', I told you!

I'm sorry, Trixie. It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

Aah! Fuckin' fuckers!
Out of here!

Fuck off!

Stay down, dick splash!

You gotta be
fucking kiddin'.

I trusted you, boom-boom,
and you betrayed me?

I'm sorry.

Oh, you're feeling sad,
are you, darling?

Well, fucking good,
you backstabbing ho!

Enough with the sublime wit,
Gage.

You know why we're here.
Who the fuck are you?

Apart from one tasty little minge
I'd like to slam like a screen door?

Where are they, Gage?
Well, now, darling,

I'm not exactly sure as
to what you're referring.

And even if I was,
I would have to ask you,

very politely, of course,
to yank on my dong.

Have it your way.
Oh, here we go.

You still pissed off
at me, Camero?

Obviously not.

Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's right.

Ooh. Oh. Ooh.

That's right. I knew you couldn't resist
Mr. Sticky much longer.

You said you like it rough.
That's right.

Where's the goods?
Blow me, you psycho rug muncher.

If I told you where they're buried,
you're just gonna fucking kill me anyway.

So why don't you
and your fucking fur pie jamboree...

just gather 'round and slob my knob?

How about you
slob my knob, huh?

So they're buried.

Okay.

Okay.

What the fuck are you laughing at?

You.
I'm laughing at you.

Always with your nose
in other people's panties.

I do what I want
when I want.

It's cunts like you
who'll always get used.

I told you never to call me that.

Let him go.
Please, let him go.

Fuck you, joyride!
You're the reason he's here.

What happened?

Open the trunk!

Let's go.
What the fuck? Fucking...

What the fuck is wrong with you?

How hard can it be
to administer a simple oral serum...

while sloshing some guy's powder keg?
What are you doing?

She's black hair,
blonde box, Hel,

and I'm gonna wail on tasty
like a dog with two dicks.

Enough. Get a hold of yourself.
You promised me she could handle it.

What happened?
I don't know.

I did everything you said.
It's not my fault.

The fuck it isn't!
Everything's destroyed.

We're never gonna find it now.

35.34.8.81N...
What?

Gage wrote it on a photograph...
Some kinda desert picture from space.

And what good
does that do us?

They may be vector coordinates.
You're sure about those numbers?

I'm positive. I have
a photojournalistic memory.

My mom used to say she wished
I was born a midget because...

Let's go.

Tell us where to dig
and the lid comes up.

It's as simple as that.

What's happening to him?

My heart.

Gage?
No, Trixie, stop!

Stupid fucking cow.
Thicker than a whale omelet.

Now, you get me outta here,
or I'll snap her neck.

Okay. Snap away.
We don't give a shit.

What?

Give me the keys
and the gun right fucking now.

Okay.

Don't hurt her.

Right. Now the gun.

You fucking whore.
You blew off my tea bag.

That's two you owe me,
blow white.

Oh, my God, you could have shot me!
But I didn't.

You're crazy!
You're welcome.

Fun's over, Gage.
Next stop, Brown Town.

If I tell you, Pinky's gonna do things
to me you can't even imagine.

Pinky? What does Pinky
have to do with this?

Whose shit you think
you're dealing with?

You work for Pinky.

Oh, yeah. Not so fucking
clever now, are ya?

You stupid bitches. When Pinky finds out
about this, you're all fucking dead.

What's he talking about?
Who's Pinky?

If you help us,

we'll not only let you live,
but we'll take you out of here to safety.

What? No, that was never
part of the deal.

I can't.

I was hoping you'd say that.

Just tell them, Gage.
Please, just tell them.

All right, all right, all right.

Fucking shit.

It's over there.

Fifteen paces due east
of the pickup.

Trixie, grab those shovels
by the trailer.

Camero, tie him up and gag him.
Put him back in the car.

What? We're not actually gonna...
Who knows if he's lying?

And if trouble comes,
we need leverage.

This is bullshit!
Just do it.

Oh!

You take orders better
than a Bangkok bum boy.

Shut your fucking cake hole.

You might have a deal with her,
but you don't have one with me.

Who are they?

Puppets.
To get what I want.

How do you know
you can trust them?

Especially that one,
that fucking stripper.

She's dangerous.
You keep your eye on her.

Stop moving!
Hey!

Don't turn your back
on this fucking toerag! She'll betray ya!

Just like she did all the others
at the fucking Glory Hole!

What's he talking about?

Oh, they don't know,
do they?

You were at the Glory Hole?

Damn fuckin' right she was! It was Camero
who'd have killed Liberty, and then...

So long, limp dick.

I love Home Depot.

Now listen here,
you fucking slag.

I have a reputation
for being very persuasive.

And I know you're a virtuoso
with them throat muscles.

So you better start spilling!

Or I'm gonna send Thaddeus here
right up your chutney tube!

No!

No! No! No! No!

Are you out of your mind?
That wasn't part of the plan.

Maybe not part of your plan.

You told me no one's gonna get hurt.
You promised me.

I know, Trixie. I know.

We couldn't have kept Gage alive.
He was dangerous.

No. I said right from the start,
we don't kill anybody.

Now all we have is a corpse linked
to Pinky and nothing to show for it.

My God, they're gonna
lock us up forever.

Shut up, ax wound.
You shut up.

What'd you say?
Back off, Camero.

No, why don't you let
"Gland Canyon" stick up for herself?

What did Gage mean by
"you'll betray us too?"

He's fuckin' with your head.

Why didn't you tell me
you were at the Glory Hole?

Why didn't you tell me
you knew Gage?

Because I didn't. He was lying.
Exactly.

This is precisely what that
conniving cock block was trying to do.

Get us to turn on each other.
He's a master manipulator, Hel.

Besides, he told us
where the stash is.

Where we hope it is, he may have
simply been trying to buy time.

He trusted me.

And now he's dead.

¶ Ain't no one as hot as me ¶

¶ That's how I roll Just agree
Ain't no apology ¶

¶ I'm so fresh, so clean
I'm so nice, so mean ¶

¶ I'm so hot, so cool ¶

Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's good.

That's it.
Show us your grabber.

You like that?

Yeah, Daddy likes.

Try this one on for size.

Fuckin' hell!

I call that move
shock and awe.

Oh, God.

I've never felt this way
about a gash before.

Oh! You are so sweet.

Oh, and you're decent and pure,
and I love you.

Now why don't we
tie a knot, bump uglies...

and ride the pork bus
to Tuna City?

We'll drink to that.

Fuckin' hell.

Hey. Hey. I need you to stay strong
and focused, Trixie.

Remember why we're here.
We all need this.

You the most.

What's that?

Ring fucking ring.
Ring fucking ring.

Ring fucking ring.
It's coming from Gage.

Ring fucking ring. Ring fucking ring.
Ring fucking ring.

Ring fucking ring.
Ring fucking ring.

Ring fucking ring.
Ring fucking ring.

Ring fucking ring. Ring fucking ring.
Los Angeles area code.

I thought I told you
to check his pockets.

What's the big deal?
Answer it.

The big deal? With the right equipment,
anyone can ping this phone.

If this is Pinky
or one of Gage's thugs,

they now know he
and even we are right here.

Oh, my goodness.
See?

This is what happens when you don't do
as you're told. Ring fucking ring...

Fuck you, Hel. I did check him, there was
no phone on him when we left.

Well, obviously there was.

You calling me a liar?
I'm calling you reckless.

Stop it, both of you.

What are we gonna do now?
I know what I'm gonna do.

Fuckin' relax, Hel.
That call means nothing.

Just probably another one
of his slutty slop buckets...

looking to get worked
like a rented mule.

We can't take that chance.

We have to find what we came for
and get out of here, fast.

Fine with me. The sooner we blow
this hellhole, the better.

But what about Gage?
Leave him for now.

We'll bury him
when we're done.

This was supposed to be easy.

So, who is this Pinky person?

Guys?

Pinky's a notorious
underworld figure.

Runs drugs, weapons,
industrial contraband,

organizes hit squads,
counterfeit rings.

He's rumored to have government contracts
for wet work and supplying terror cells.

Nobody deals with Pinky directly,
and nobody even knows what he looks like.

Many believe Pinky is a phantom.

Others think he sold his soul to the devil.
I think he is the devil.

Come on.
You're just messing with me.

Listen up, super ball.

I've seen his victims
hanging from hooks,

cut open
like slaughtered lambs,

holding their guts in their hands,
pleading for death.

A few years ago, a Russian Oligarch
named Vladimir "The Butcher" Popmeov...

went after Pinky
with 50 of his best assassins.

Pinky blazed through that shit storm
armed only with a dusty old sword.

When it was over, the only thing left was
a 15-foot pile of dismembered bodies...

and Popmeov's head piked up...

like the twinkly star
on a Christmas tree.

There ain't a mac
or a blow job on the streets...

that ain't scared
shitless of him.

Now this guy's after us?

Oh, crap.

Oh, my God,
it feels so good! Give it to me.

Get off. Gotta go.

Where's the key, Black Ice?
Fuck you, busty. I don't have it.

Fuck you, bitch!
Give me back my pick.

Hey, darlin', wanna go
for the ride of your life?

Huh?

¶ Yeah ¶

¶ Yeah ¶

¶ She's a hot devil woman ¶

¶ One that I desire ¶

¶ Take my tremblin'
dirty hand ¶

¶ Throw it in your thighs ¶

¶ Hey ¶

¶ You got to take
this salvation ¶

¶ I wanna have my fun ¶

¶ Oh, yeah
Come on, man So sexy ¶

¶ Yeah ¶

What?

Nothing.

Oh, fuck.

Gage.

Let's get him in the trunk.
Trixie, cover up any signs of blood.

You got him?
Come on.

Come on!

This is crazy. Let's just tell the truth
and end all this.

Don't say one fucking word.
No way I'm going back to the stocks.

If I have to,
I'll take him out.

No. Both of you just shut up
and let me do the talking.

Ladies,
everything okay here?

Boy, are we glad to see you.

I, uh, saw the fence down
at the highway.

You aren't supposed
to be out here.

Government used to test nukes.

Stay too long, and you'll grow
a third eye.

How, uh... How did you ladies
end up out here anyway?

Well, Officer,
it's quite a story.

See, my sisters and I are members
of the Sacred Girls Virgin Choir...

out in Sand Dab, Arizona.

We were supposed to perform
a cantata today out in Mojave.

Since we were
so far from home,

the local parish director kindly suggested
that we stay as his guests.

Well, after we were all snuggled
into our one little bed for the night,

we heard loud music and laughter
coming from outside.

We peeked our heads out only to
discover the entire congregation...

dancing and... and laughing...

and smoking something
that may not have been tobacco.

They tried to fondle
our num-nums...

and even convinced Bambi Lynn
to shoot Communion wafers out of her...

Anyway, we got out
and ran to our car, but they chased us.

Well, thank the Lord
Cheyenne can drive...

and Bambi Lynn can gyrate
because we lost 'em!

By then, well,
it was 3:00 am. and... and dark.

And we were scared.

And someone's not very good
with directions.

And, well,
we ended up out here.

And now, if you can believe it,
our car's dead.

I see.
We tried to jump her,

but we just couldn't
get her off.

That's why we're all dirty
and desperate.

You must think the worst of us.
No. Don't be silly.

I already
called the tow company,

and they're
on their way, Deputy...

Fucks.

Fuchs. It's, uh...
Fuchs, ma'am.

Oh.
Oops.

You know,
let me take a look at her.

Sometimes you just gotta know
how to finger these old beauties.

That won't be necessary.
Why not?

What happened to your hand?

Cut it on my crucifix.
You know what?

The towing company already made us post
a 200 dollar deposit for coming out here.

Said they'd arrive by noon.

Maybe I can save you
that money. Hmm?

Oh. Yeah, they don't make 'em
like this anymore.

Nowadays, it's all computers
and sensors.

Got to work at NASA
just to change the oil.

Alright, uh, turn the key, please.

See? Nothing.

That's odd. It, uh,
must be the starter.

You know what?

Sometimes these old cars
have tool kits along with the jacks.

You can't!

You can't!

Why not?
Be... Because...

Because the trunk lock
is rusted out.

Hasn't opened in years.

You okay, miss?
She'll be fine.

She's still upset
about last night.

Those choirboys
tried to defile her.

Listen, you've been so
helpful and kind.

The least I can do is
come back here and cook for you.

Say, dinner Friday?

It's a...

It's a tempting offer, but,
uh, I'll, uh, tell you what.

I'll... I'll swing back around later,
make sure, uh, you ladies got away safely.

Have a nice day, y'all.

I bet you
he's calling us in right now.

We should have told him.
He looked like a nice guy.

He doesn't suspect a thing.

¶ Yeah, Stank E. Digitz ¶

¶ When your bitch is on the rag
and you still wanna bang ¶

¶ Throw a towel down
Throw a towel down ¶

¶ When between her legs is red
you don't wanna wreck the bed ¶

¶ Throw a towel down
Throw a towel down ¶

¶ Can't stand this new trend
My girlfriend says ¶

¶ That every month for four
to six days I can't spend ¶

¶ No time gettin' intimate
I guess it's innocent ¶

¶ Cause for sure ain't no baby
comin' through her like a vent ¶

¶ Six days, that's a long
time to be down ¶

Hey.

¶ Ave Maria ¶

¶ Gratia plena ¶

¶
¶ Ave Maria ¶

Who wants into my pearly gates?

Me! I do!
I'm a minister!

My God!

Fuck off.

¶ Immaculate conception ¶

¶ It's only a deception ¶

¶ She'd never reveal
what the devil sees ¶

¶ It's only her illusion ¶

¶ I come to your conclusion ¶

¶ The devil don't care
'cause he's already been there ¶

¶ Don't love her
Can't hate her ¶

¶ Just pay her and lay her ¶

¶

I'm Trixie,
your little slice of heaven.

I am in love.

Good girl.

¶ It's only a deception ¶

¶ She'd never reveal
what the devil sees ¶

You know, I've been thinking.
Christ.

Is stealing from a criminal
any better than just being a criminal?

I've got a better one
for you, princess.

What's the most outrageous place
you've ever been key-holed?

Why do you wanna know?
Just curious.

It says
a lot about a woman.

Hmm. Either a bumper car three-way
at the Redlands County Fair...

or on top of a horse-drawn buggy
in Amish Country with Jakey Stalfoos.

Hel?

Let's have a little less chitchat
and a lot more digging, huh?

I'm gonna grind those secrets
out of you one day, Hel.

I don't have any secrets.

Well,
what about you, Camero?

My best bang
was a contortionist...

out behind the freak show tent
at Circus Nudieus.

I couldn't stand straight for days.
Never did get her name.

Evening, Hot Wire.

Haven't seen your ugly mug
since the Glory Hole.

Camero, I was...
I was just following orders.

No hard... Smurf! Shit! Skittle!
Piss... feelings, huh?

Where's Gage?

I don't know.

I don't have time to
be dry-fucked tonight.

Honey, I'm undefeated here.

Alright, alright. Gage put together
another Bombshell Bitchfest Blowout.

Friday, midnight.

It just keeps getting
hotter and hotter.

I can't take this anymore.

Hey, don't waste all the...

Grab my nuts and call me Sally.

Uh, you might wanna cover up.

What?

Don't tell me you don't want
some of what I'm selling.

I'm gonna get you wet.

Okay, quit messing around, Trixie.
I mean it.

You fuckin' bitch.

Hey.

Don't even think about it.

You two fucking bitches are dead.

Did the verbals
from sat-comm concur?

Gage must have
a sick sense of humor.

And a death wish.

Does the girl suspect anything?
No, Phoenix.

Everything is proceeding as planned.
Mobilize the ops.

We move in five days' time.

The nano-swarm is active,
and the casualties will be immense.

Time to move.
They've traced us.

Ow.

Are you okay?
Something's poking my heinie.

What's that?

Help me dig.

I think this is it.

Hooray for us.
We rock!

Oh!
Oh, my God.

Looks like he hasn't been
out here that long.

Maybe a few weeks.

No one I know.
Poor bastard. Didn't die quickly.

Someone was trying
to work something out of him.

Gage?

No.

He was dark, not this dark.

There's only one person
that would do this kinda thing.

Are we being watched?

This is crazy!
I've had enough!

I wanna go home!
Calm down, Trix.

Calm down? That's all you keep
telling me, Hel, but people keep dying!

I can't end up like him!

We're running out of time.
Your friend's losing it.

She'll be fine.
I'm not going down because of her.

I said she'll be fine.
Check the perimeter.

I'm sorry, Hel.
I thought I could do this.

I thought
I could be strong.

No, Trix.
I let you down.

I never should have
asked you to do this.

You didn't force me.

I wanted to be here...
with you.

You're the first person in my whole life
who's ever really believed in me.

We shouldn't.

Not here.

Please.

I need you.

I've never felt
this way before.

About anyone.

Then why don't you
kiss me?

Now.

What the fuck?

Camero.
I can explain.

I'm out there sweating my ass off,
and you're in here bashing gash?

And Gage was right.
I can't trust you.

Yes, you can.
Bullshit!

What else
aren't you telling me?

You planning on cutting me out
of the score as well?

Don't be ridiculous.

Who's being fucking
ridiculous, Hel?

It's my fault, Camero.
I asked Hel not to tell you.

I knew you'd fly off the handle
and become even more uncontrollable.

So I need to be controlled.

Is that what you think? Is it?
No.

Because I'm not the one here
plumbing the depths of cooterlicious,

pretending to be
something I'm not.

I knew you were trouble.
I never should have let Hel bring you in.

We wouldn't have found this place
without her, remember?

True.
So now we can waste her.

Kill her and you'll
have to kill me too.

And then you won't have anyone
to fence the goods or work the contacts.

Is that what you want?

I'm sorry, Camero.

I should have told you about us
right from the start,

but I never thought about
betraying you on this deal.

We're all in this
to the end.

Either we all win
or we all lose,

and losing now
has way too high a price.

Lie again
and you're both dead.

Oh, I'm sorry.

That was my fault.
I couldn't control myself.

Don't ever apologize
for being you.

You know,
she scares me, Hel.

Are you sure she's
not gonna try something?

With Camero, there's no sure things.
Help me up, will you?

Whoa.

Looks like Gage
was ready for war.

Camero, get in here!
We found something!

K-14 Corsair rail gun...

Carbon fiber mounts,

Hellfire dampening system
and Zion laser scope.

This is some serious
and classified hardware.

How do you know all that?

My father was a part of the C.I.A.'s
Ghost Recon Group in the '80s.

Oh.

Camero, you hear me?

W... Where did she go?

Camero?

Where are you?

Trixie, get inside,
quick.

What up, bitches?
Hi, hi!

You ain't kidding, Kinki. It's the Poontang
Valley Express around here.

Hmm.

Who the hell are you?

Think of us as, uh,

debt collectors,
Pussybone Parfait!

Oh.

Uh-oh, naughty girl.

Kinki spanking.

Take it easy. Take it easy.
You're okay.

Looks like we got you
by the balls this time, Camero.

You know these two?

Oh, when she came looking for Gage,
I figured something big was up.

Love me long time, jeeter!

We've been tracking you.

So...

the legendary
Gage treasure is true.

Where is it at?
We don't know.

Look, don't dry fuck me.
I won't think twice about having Kinki...

shit me a loud
purple twinkie...

your pretty little faces.

Gage lied to us.
It's not buried where he said.

Oh.

Well, then you better
keep digging.

Fuck that. I ain't shoveling
anything for you but your grave.

Enough! We'll dig.
Just leave her alone.

I'm gonna enjoy beating
7 shades of shit out of both of you!

Still... Bunghole Barney Bungalow...
same old Camero.

Now start fucking digging.

I want to play with the...

Not you, cherry pie.

You stay here.

Do as he says.

You see, Kinki likes you.

Kinki wants to play.

What does she
wanna play?

Yeah. Ooh.

I need help gettin' off.

I'm going to miss you, Camero.

You certainly have
livened up my incarceration.

Inmate 1138.
You're ready for processing.

All clear.

Evac Cell 2187.
But...

I told you.
I can still get you out.

But you have to give me
something to work with.

Stick your finger
in her ass, Camero.

All right, let's go.

Can I trust you?

Of course.

Get me outta here, and I'll split
200 million in diamonds with you.

Giddyup!
Giddyup!

Come on! Go faster!
You're my horse.

Come on. Let's go.
Faster.

Whoo!
Yee-ha!

Ride her, Kinki! Whoo!

Giddyup. Show your mama.
Come on. Let's go. Faster.

Hey.
Huh?

It's a private show!
Back to work!

Let's go! Come on!
Yah!

If I make a diversionary run
for the guns,

you think you can get
close enough to Trixie?

Huh?

Oh, what, are you not
talking to me now?

Come on, Camero. I need you.
To save Miss Magic Mouth?

No way.

Are you on something?

I don't even know
who you are anymore.

I should've
never trusted you,

certainly never
fallen in love.

Get 'em, girl! Get 'em, girl!

Whoo! Whoo!

That's it.

Get up.

Get up.
No.

No! No! No!
Stop! No! No! No!

Forget about her.

We can pull this off.
It's about you and me now.

No! No! Stop it!
Help! Help me!

Stop! No! No!

Hey, we've
found something!

Gorgonzola orgy!

Come on, flat ass.

Clear it.

You clear it.

Open it.
I said open it.

On your knees,
balloon boobs.

It's the only place
you've ever been good at anyway.

Open it!

Maybe there's
some kind of code.

Well, who knows the... P... P... Plumps
when you cook it... code?

Who knows it?

No one?

Kinki's right. No one spills,
no reason to keep you alive.

Wait! Let me try.

Let me try.
Hurry up!

Okay.
Hurry it up!

Okay.
Hurry up!

Whoo-ee!

Thank you, Happy Sacks.
We'll take it from here.

Kinki, kill 'em.
Okay.

Hold it!

I knew something
was going on here.

Drop it!

Uh, everybody
on the ground. Go!

Drop it, I said.
Come on. Drop it.

All right, this is the last time
I'm gonna tell you.

Drop the weapon
and get on the ground!

Okay, let's go.

Let's go. Come on.

Oh, no.
Get away!

Somebody has
a problem here.

Get away.
Here I come.

Come on.

Oh, shit!

No!

Fortune cookie say,
"Future not so bright".

Who...
Stop!

are you?

Camero, stop!

Stop it, Camero! No!
That's it, Pop Tart.

I'm gonna dog-pound you
straight to China.

That's enough,
God-fucking-damn it!

I've had enough of this bullshit!
It's gonna end right fucking now!

Starting to lose our cool, are we?
We tie him up in the trailer.

Let's gank this fucker right now.
No matter who he is,

he won't nipple-lick us
if he's sucking daisy roots.

No more killing today,
period.

If you were up for 7 to 10, Hel,
how did you fly in under 3 weeks?

And how the fuck did you spring me
with 12 years left on my sentence?

Well, this is America. She.. She's sexy and
loaded and has high-powered connections.

Bullshit.
I just saved your ass, again.

The fuck you did!
I had it under control.

You're becoming
a liability, Camero,

not to mention a martyr
to selective amnesia.

You're so hopped up on whatever shit
you're dropping, you're irrational.

Fuck you! I'm finally starting to see you
for who you really are.

What is she
talking about?

The prison,
the weapons, the cash.

Your mastery
of Honduran snuff sex.

You wanna tell Good & Plenty
what you punched in, or should I, Hel, huh?

7-5-6-5-0.
What does that spell?

Oh, my God!
Why did you do that?

I had no choice, Trixie.

She's clearly delusional
and off the rails.

Grab his cuffs
and secure him inside.

What are you gonna do?

What needs to be done.

I'm sorry.

Thank you, Trixie.

How do you know my name?
Uh...

Who are you?

I'm a big fan.

A what?

Uh... An aficionado
of your ass... sets.

Uh, I've seen you at Papa Piccolo's
Naughty Knickers Round-up.

You're... astonishing and...

uh, gorgeous.

When I... I came by earlier,
I... I knew it was you.

And I... I could tell something was wrong,
and I was worried about you.

Oh, God...

I'm sorry. You must think
I'm some kind of... crazy stalker.

You were worried
about me?

What's your name?

Roy.

Deputy Roy Eugene Fuchs, ma'am.

That's a nice name.

What are you mixed up in?

Who are those women?

I don't even think
I know anymore.

Let me help you, Trixie.

Come on.

Hey, I'll be back.

It's not too late to make
the right decision, Trixie.

Either way,
I'm here for you.

Where's Camero?

You chained her up?

She's all right. Come on.

I'm scared, Hel.
What's going on?

You're just gonna have
to trust me on this, Trixie.

Now, let's go.

I'm sorry.

You better pray to whatever God
you worship I don't get outta this thing.

What is it
that troubles you, Sister?

You have to help me,
Mother Superior.

My impure thoughts have gone
beyond inanimate objects...

and devolved into lusting
after strapping Latvian gymnasts.

No!

Oh, Sister Sara.

Ah.
Oh!

Oh. Uh...
God-fucking-damn it.

Sister Prudence Bangtail.

Well, this is the last straw.

Save it, crusty.
I'm vapor.

This place bites anyway.

Ooh!

May God have mercy
on your soul.

Freeze, Sister!

Put your hands in the air.
Do it now.

Well, well, well.

Hiding out
in a convent?

Impersonating a nun?
Juggling pussy in a pornographic circus?

Oh, that is tasteless,
even for you, Camero.

Ah.

Right-o, lads,

don't be afraid
to use excessive force on this one.

I can't see a thing.

Move back.

What is all this?

It's everything Gage stole from Pinky.
Huh?

That crafty fucker's
been funneling Pinky's goods for years.

That's why
he stashed out here...

so he could secretly distribute the goods
each time a buyer was secured.

How do you know
all this?

If you lay with criminals...
Be careful.

There will be
dangerous shit down here.

Hey, Hel, look at this.

It's beautiful.
Can I keep it?

Sure. Keep it.

I found them.

Oh, my!

Flawless,

uncoded...

and all ours.

Well, what now?

Time to disappear.

Shit.

What do we do? What do we do?
Just get to the car and start it up.

But we can't leave Roy.
Go!

But... But...
Just... Just go to the car!

Time to get medieval.

Camero, ease up.

We have the diamonds.
Okay? The plan worked.

All we have to do is drive away,
and we've won.

Bullshit.

I trusted you before.
Look where that got me.

Goddamn it, Camero!
I'm not gonna let you fuck this up now!

Drop that chain and get
your head on straight.

Time to test your loyalty
and see what you're really made of.

A wet-job, Polly punanni,
and all is forgiven, whoever you are.

Come on.
You and me started this.

You and me should finish it.
No.

We're in this together.
Fine.

Then I'm gonna sleigh-ride
your sorry ass once and for all.

If you want me,

come and get me.

Come on, guys.
Don't. Please don't.

Come on, guys. Stop!

I said stop!

Stop!
Camero, stop it!

You're next, Pantyraid.

Stay down, Camero.
I don't wanna have to kill you.

How do you like it, bitch?

Did you really think
you could beat me, huh?

Get this fucking going!

Trixie. Trixie!

Trixie!

Fire in your hole.

So long, bitches.

Ram this in your clambake,
bitch cake.

Roy! Roy!

Go ahead and kill me.

I don't care anymore.

It's all a lie, isn't it?

Yes.

Why?

Who are you?

Are you...
No.

I'm not Pinky.

I'm...

Give me the specs, Dieter.

The specs! Now!

You've got the wrong überman.

I know nothing of this
murderous plague you speak of.

Wrong answer, Dieter.

Congratulations, Foxy 69.

Mission accomplished, Phoenix.
I have the antitoxin data.

I have another assignment
that demands your immediate attention.

As you know, the Glory Hole was a...
regrettable miscalculation.

But tac-comm has learned of another
opportunity to retrieve the nano-swarm.

I'm sending you to
Honey Junction Women's Prison...

to infiltrate and make contact with
a former colleague of Mortimer Gage.

She goes by an alias, Camero.

I'm on it.

Good. Now, bury all evidence
and get yourself home.

Phoenix out.

Oh, my God.

You're a wicked-cool
covert operative...

masquerading
as a sex-toy tycoon?

Mm-hmm.

My mission was
to reclaim that...

a weaponized vial
of synthetic nano-swarm...

that Gage hijacked
from a C.I.A. convoy.

It's filled with trillions
of self-replicating robo-viruses...

that latch on to any living organism
and suck the carbon out...

till you, me, even the cockroaches
are nothing more than gray goo.

It could wipe out an entire continent
if properly deployed.

I had to extricate it
before Gage tried, again,

to sell it to another combatant country
or crazed libertarian.

So the plan,
the diamonds, us...

was all just a crock?

No. Not us, Trix.

What I am doesn't change
how I feel about you.

Everything
between us is real.

You've changed me.

Made me see a life
I've been missing.

Craving really.

I'm through being Foxy 69.

But you can't just walk away
from Flesh Force Foxy...

with a wink
and a hi-dee-ho.

I needed leverage
and a huge bankroll.

The vial and the diamonds
give us both.

Now you, Lily and me can slip off
to a small Micronesian island together...

forever.

And playfully wrestle
in the surf?

Among other things.

I love you.
Mmm.

The bitch is back, baby.

It hurts, doesn't it?
Having someone you love taken away.

It wasn't her fault,
Camero.

Fuck you!
It was all her fault.

I have nothing.

Nothing!

And it's all because of her
and you.

I'm gonna booty-bang
bitch slap your fucking ass...

until you're
just this side of salvage.

Then I'm gonna ram-ride
girly's show tits asunder...

before I plow both of you
bitches under!

Open wide, psycho slut!

Lube my boobs,
skank twat!

You had enough?

No.
You?

Blow me.

Fuck layin' tube!

Fuck wad!
Lick my love pup!

Blow my biscuit!

No.

Camero, stop!

No! Please, no! Stop!

No!

No. No. Hel, no!

Just us now, Buttercups.

Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!

Mrs. Honeypot,
can Trixie come out to die?

Stop! No! No! No!

Come on. Fight me!

I'm too weak and vulnerable.

Fine. If you won't fight,
then you gotta fuck.

Prepare to come about, bitch.
Camero, stop!

Time to get me some
of what Hel's been gettin'.

Stop! Stop, please!

Don't! Please!

Hello, kitty.

Yeah!

I'm gonna baste your giblets,
butter britches.

You're her?

You're my best lay ever?

Surprise.

You lying fucking whore!

The women's movement
will hoist my skirt for all eternity.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

How did it come to this?

How did it come to this?

I'll tell you.
Human nature.

Early Christianity tells us
of humanity's seven deadly sins.

I'm unclear whether lust,
gluttony, greed, sloth,

wrath, envy and pride
are human sins...

or defining
human characteristics.

Foxy 69, target on sight.

Roger that.

Foxy down in 20, 19,

18, 17...

Foxy 69 in position.

Hold it. We'll take those.

Ooh. That's a bit frightening,
isn't it?

Foxy, take 'em out.

Help me!

Oh, my God.

Camero!

What the fuck is that?

Bite me!

Oh, yeah.

Trixie, why?

What can I say?

We're all just bitches
in the end.

Who are you?

I think you know.

But why me?

Why Camero?

You were lost souls,

and I thought
it would be fun.

And Phoenix?
Phoenix works for me.

Always has... or did.

He got careless.

I guess we know
where that ended up.

So this whole thing...

my mission, us meeting,

Camero...

It was all for this.

Made in the 16th century
by Master Craftsman Umatada Mjouji.

This naginata has seen battles won
and empires fall...

for over 600 years.

It's the one thing
I love on this godforsaken Earth.

And Gage was stupid enough
to think I didn't care.

How could you do this?

Play the victim?
I loved you.

A girl's gotta get her jollies
somehow.

Oh.

And I really get off
watching girls fight.

You guys were awesome.
What are you waiting for?

Go on.
Finish your sick little game.

We read we ought
to forgive our enemies,

but we do not read...
That we should forgive our friends.

Cosimo de' Medici, 1454.

Go to hell, Trixie!

Last one in's a rotten egg.

Last one in's a rotten egg.

"All warfare is based on deception.

"Hence, when able to attack,
we must seem unable.

"When using our forces,
we must seem inactive.

"When we are near, we must make
the enemy believe we are far away.

"When far away, we must
make him believe we are near.

"Hold out baits
to entice the enemy.

Feign disorder and crush him".

Sun Tzu, The Art of War,
380 B.C.
