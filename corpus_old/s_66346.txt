It stopped.

What's that, Dave?

Nothing.

How we doing?

Oh, we're ready.

You feeling the magic?

Oh, I'm feeling the magic,
all right.

Let's hit 'em.

Yeah.

Let's do it.

Here we go.

Let's hit 'em.

Let's go make $30 million.

Good morning.

Before I begin, let me...

David?

I'll go get help.

Jesus. Jesus, David.

Phone 9-1-1. Phone 9-1-1!

David?

Nick?

Vicky?!

Vicky!

Okay, it's okay.

It's okay.

Everybody else off the bus.

Sound waves.

So, if we know that sound waves

gain wavelength
and lose frequency

as they travel
through more dense materials...

...then the anomalies
in these waves

are the means by which
we can surmise

the fundamental architecture
of our planet.

How are the nails coming,
Christine?

Good.

All right,
let's have a demonstration.

Mr. Acker, Veronica.

Thank you very much.

All right.

Mrs. Limestone,
being a big softie, you know,

loves walks in the park,
bedtime stories,

big romantic.

Loves Chet.

I can't play Chet,
but I'll see what I can do.

Watch the oscilloscope,
all right?

Here we go.

Dr. Joshua Keyes?

Maybe.

Yes or no, sir?

The first one.

Please come with us, sir.

Guys, wh-what's going on?

We don't know, sir.

What do you mean,
you don't know?

Your security clearance
is higher than ours.

I have security clearance?

We're just here to
bring you to your jet.

I have a jet?

Hey, Serge.

Ah!

Serge.

Serge.

Damn!

It's about time.
You're always late.

Let's keep moving, gentlemen.

What am I doing here?

They wouldn't brief me
until you got here.

You know, there are biochemists
everywhere, military.

I hate them.

When are you going to meet
a nice girl

and bring her for dinner?

I'm married to my work.

So am I.

Which makes my wife
my mistress...

that's why I'm still
in love with her.

You were always a romantic.

I love my wife.

Yeah, I know.
I love your wife, too.

I know.

But I don't love your wife.
You know what I mean.

You don't love her
the same way, you know.

It's the French.
I think it's the cheese.

Ah, the cheese.

You're...
you're teasing me, right?

Oh, my...!

Whoa. Wait, these are bodies.

I think we're
in the wrong place here.

Yeah, we're in the wrong place.

No. If you were
in the wrong place,

you would've already been shot.

That's a hell of a greeting.

Serge.

Serge.

Serge. Yes.
Always a pleasure.

Same here, Thomas.

Dr. Keyes.

I know.
Tom Purcell.

Gentlemen, you do realize
that everything here

is totally classified, okay?

At 10:30 a.m. Local time,

32 civilians,
all within a 10-block radius...

died.

They didn't get sick first.

They simply hit the ground dead.

Nerve agent?

Our first guess. No.

They all died
at the same time?

As far as we can tell,
to the second.

This hits CNN in one hour.

I need a reason.

Is there a variation
in sex, age, body type?

They all had pacemakers.

Under a minute.

Your reputation is
well deserved.

Hey, hey, hey.
How did you guess?

Without any clues
from the victims?

No, that's...

Serge and I are the clues.

I mean, he specializes
in high energy weapons.

I do geomagnetics.

So calling us means you suspect

an electromagnetic
pulse weapon.

If these are
the only fatalities,

they must be people
susceptible to...

electronic interference.

QED pacemakers.

You're spooky sometimes, eh?

Now I need to know,

did some sort of weapon
kill these people?

The power that you would need

to create an EM pulse
strong enough...

I mean, that's...
that's not a weapon that

I've ever heard of.
No.

Okay, we're done.

We're not done, sir.

There's nothing on the other
side of the equal sign.

I agree with Joshua...

Thank you.

Our greatest concern was this
may have been an act of war,

but since it's not,

I think we can all breathe
a little easier, can't we?

Look at my hat.

What is it, sweetheart?

It's okay, son.

These things happen
all the time and...

Let's, go, let's go!
Come on!

Justin!

Watch out, you bloody idiot!

Hurry! Run!

Daddy!

The skies are empty
over Nelson's Column now,

but a few hours ago,
it was a different story.

Eyewitnesses claimed that
the frenzied swarms of birds

were not in fact attacking
people deliberately...

And it's not just this time.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

But seemed to be confused
and flying blind.

The FOrtean Times reported
violent bird swarms

twice last month in
Australia and Japan.

Five people are confirmed dead
and dozens injured

in the panic that followed the
bizarre and terrifying incident

in London's historic
Trafalgar Square.

Weird.
Mm-hmm.

Quite strange, also.

Mm. Strange, indeed.

Mm!

How do birds navigate?

By sight?

No, no, no,
the long range stuff.

Magnetic fields.

Little ions in their brains

align with the magnetic field
of the Earth.

Yeah, what she said.
Right?

Acker.

Hit the 'Net, do a search for...

oh, two years ought to do it.

Any and all, like, "weird news",
you know...

bizarre animal migrations,

specifically birds.

Whale and dolphin beachings.

Unusual atmospheric phenomenon,
unexplained plane crashes,

you know,
just use your imagination.

That is a huge search.

You can use our T-1 line
to look up Sailor Moon crap.

You're up to this.

Danni, Danni,
get me the brightest kids

from the Field Theory Class,

and design a computer model
of an electromagnetic field.

What are we doing?

I need a 3-D computer model
of the Earth

to lay the field over.

Whoa-ho-ho, the planet Earth?

Yeah, the planet Earth.
You know, the pretty blue one.

Map out the anomalies
that Acker finds

and grunt out the equations.

And, uh...

grab those smelly kids

from the Non-Linear
Diff class, too.

Listen, Josh, do we even
have time for this?

Do this and I'll sign
your doctorates blindfolded.

Blindfolded?
Blindfolded.

Do not pass Go.
Go directly to PhD.

Be wrong. Be wrong.

Tim, I'm coming in a little hot.

Give me some drag, will you?

Roger that.

We are in attitude and ready
for an entry interface.

Nice work, Major.

I have the controls
now for E.I.

I could take us in.

You could...

but you won't.

I'm ready for this, Bob.

Oh, no, you're not, Beck.

You're trained,
and you're certified...

doesn't make you the commander.

And the commander
lands the bird.

You got to be the youngest
person ever in space.

You should say,
thank you, be happy.

Now.

EndeavOur, Houston,
at this time

we show you go for reentry.

Houston, EndeavOur descending
through 400,000 feet

coming upon entry interface.

EndeavOur, this is Flight.

Weren't able to annoy
the commander

into letting you
bring her in this time?

That's a negative, Stick.

I'll have to be
more annoying next time.

Is that even possible?

EndeavOur,

we see you in
good entry config.

Roger, Houston.

Advise.

I'm seeing those
plasma trails now.

All right, mark 241/2.

So, a minute to air.

I don't believe in belts.

Just get me through the Earth's
atmosphere in this spaceship.

Com dropout.

Start the I Com.

Let's wait till the...

Com restored.

Quiet!

We are out of position here.

Guidance shows us
on energy and on course.

Well, I've made this approach
213 times in the simulator.

We're not where we should be.

Where the hell are we?

EndeavOur, guidance is bad.

You are now
1-2-niner miles off course.

Roger, Houston.
We sort of noticed.

Is that...?

Los Angeles. That is confirmed.

We are 1-5 thousand feet.

We got maybe two minutes
of glide time left.

Doesn't make sense.

The guidance,
the beacons are all wrong?

We're heading straight
for downtown.

We're not going to crash
into Los Angeles.

They're going to hit
downtown L.A.

At 300 knots.

Bob, you know L.A.?
Because I have an idea.

Houston, those buildings
are getting mighty big.

Can you clear a freeway?

Okay, thank you.

Come on. Come on.

It's rush hour, Commander,

and it's bumper-to-bumper.

Sir, I have an alternate.

If you turn to heading 1-7-5...

It's Houston's call. Houston?

Computers are still plotting.

Come on.

Houston, we are running

out of time here.

Sir, I have an alternate.

All right, Beck,
what do you got?

Houston, I have coordinates

for an alternate landing site.

Can you confirm?

EndeavOur, give them to me.

I show possible touchdown...
at 33.55 north, 118.10 west.

Bill?

It's theoretically possible.

EndeavOur,

that is confirmed.

Turn right, heading 1-7-5.

Expect visual contact

with Los Angeles River
in five seconds.

No, that will not work, Houston.

We got bridges
every few hundred yards.

Our wingspan alone
is going to fold us up.

I've figured the "L"
over "D" max.

We can make it
if you can bring us straight in.

We're coming in high and hot.

290 feet, 320.

270, 3-0-5...
Arm the gear.

You're armed.

Gear down. Now.

Gear in transition.

240 feet, 290.

Hang on.
This isn't going to be subtle.

210 feet, 265.

Get out of the way! Move!

Derotate.

Inward.

230... 210...

Speed brakes!

100%.

Oh, we're way too fast.

Deploy the chute.

No. We'd snag the bridge.
We'll tear the tail off.

Banking right.

Commander, that next bridge!

Watch it!

We're way too high
for that one!

Suck up the gear!

Not yet.
We'll lose all steering.

We hit, it's over!

And... gear up now!

Lock your harnesses.
This is out of my hands.

Let's get out of here!

Run! Let's get out!

Dr. Zimsky?!

Will you make sure
my assistant has

your number, darling?

Sure.

Dr. Zimsky!
Hello.

I'll call security.

No, it's all right.
It's all right. Hello.

Thank you, sir.

Dr. Zimsky.
Yes. What's your name?

Josh Keyes.
Josh.

No, sir, I don't need you
to sign it.

I need you to read that.

I'm sorry, I don't have time.

I'm late for the White House.
Sir, please.

I need you to confirm
my results, sir.

Young man, do you have any idea
who I am?

Yes, I do, sir.
Please read this.

What's it about?

It's the end of the world.

No, I... this is impossible.
I'm sorry.

L-l-I can't have missed this.

You-You have to be wrong.

I mean, look, I'm sure

with careful comparison
to my own work,

we'll find that
you are mistaken.

No offense, but...

Well, I mean,
we'll know soon enough.

The bigger effects will start up
any day now.

Rebecca?

Only you and Dad
ever call me that.

Well, Beck.

So, what brings you
to sunny D.C.?

The Board of Review
is next week.

Just trying to get a sense
of the mood upstairs.

How bad is it?

Your crew crashed
the space shuttle.

Now, how good do you
think it could be?

Sir, this is my life.

Well...

I was studying for the academy
when I was 13.

It still is and has always been
my life.

It's over.

It's over, Rebecca.

I'm sorry.

It's right down here.

Really?

It's like the 4th of July.

What the hell's the hurry here?

Rebecca, would you excuse me,
please?

Excuse me.

Purcell.

Thomas, um, look...

it seems that destiny
may have caught up with us.

Did Zimsky really try
to give you his autograph?

Ah, Monsieur Zimsky.

Conrad Zimsky.

Herr Zimsky.

Superstar.

Oh...

I think I skipped drunk.

Went right to hangover.

Weren't you the one?

I spoke with the kids.

They don't sleep at night.

They look at the sky, and...
and they think it's pretty.

Is there any chance
you're wrong?

No. The sky, man.

The sky... I mean,
that's just the beginning.

That's high-altitude
static discharge.

I know.

Dr. Keyes...

...your presence is
required at the Pentagon.

Ah... it's my best buddies.

Hey!

Why don't you join
us for a drink?

We'd be grateful if you could
join us for a ride, sir.

And if I were to say no?

Just asking.
Yeah.

Well, we have
no sense of humor.

That's true.

Oh...

And we're armed.

Thank you.

Dr. Keyes, welcome.

Thank you.

Dr. Zimsky informs us

that you made a
useful contribution

to his investigations,
so he wanted you

to assist him
in the briefing.

That's very generous of you,
Dr. Zimsky.

Science is a selfless business,
dear boy.

Now, why don't you begin,

and I'll fill in
all the difficult bits.

All right, I'll put this
as simply as I can.

Everybody on Earth
is dead in a year.

And let me explain why.

Wrapped around the Earth
is an invisible field of energy.

It's made up of...
electricity and magnetism,

so it's called...
creatively enough...

the electromagnetic field.

It's where we get our magnetic
North Pole and South Pole,

and it protects us
from cosmic radiation.

So this EM field is our friend.

But now...?

But now,

that field is falling apart.

Why?

Why?

This here.

Does somebody have a can
of air freshener?

Quick and dirty.

The thin skin,
that's the Earth's crust.

That's what we live on.

It's 30 miles thick.

The meat here,
call it the mantle.

And forgetting
all the-the funky transitions,

it's 2,000 miles thick.

The core,

the peach pit in the center...
that's a tricky one.

There's two parts...

the inner core
and the outer core.

Are you following me?

The inner core

is, uh...

well, it's a big, solid chunk
of iron,

we think.

And that's surrounded

by the outer core,
and that is liquid.

Yes, but,

most importantly, this liquid
is constantly spinning

in one direction.

So a trillion trillion tons
of hot metal

spinning at
a thousand miles an hour, so...

Right, so Physics 101...

hot metal moving fast
makes an electromagnetic field.

This spinning liquid outer core
is the engine

that drives the EM Field.

And that's where
we have our problem.

This engine has stalled.

The core of the Earth
has stopped spinning.

How could this have happened?

We don't know.

What's the timeline here?

As the EM Field
becomes more and more unstable,

we'll start seeing
isolated incidents.

One plane
will fall from the sky,

and then two, and then...

in a few months, anything...

everything electronic
will be fried.

Static discharges
in the atmosphere

will create "super-storms"
with hundreds

of lightening strikes
per square mile.

After that, it gets bad.

The Earth's EM Field

shields us from the solar winds,
which are a lethal blend

of radioactive particles
and microwaves.

When that shield collapses,
microwave radiation

will literally

cook our planet.

Dr. Zimsky.

This is the Sun.

This is the Earth...
without the EM Field.

Would you?

Mm-hmm.

Three months, gentlemen,
and we're back in the Stone Age.

A full year,
the field collapses...

and that.

May I?

Feel free to throw up.
I know I did.

So, how do we fix it?

We can't.

Not in my vocabulary.

Then you might want
to get one of those

Word-A-Day calendars,
General, because

it's impossible.

The core is the size
of Mars.

You're talking about
jump-starting a planet.

This is a superheated
hyper-fluid

of molten iron and nickel
at 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

2,000 miles down,
1,000 miles thick.

And the deepest we've ever been
is... seven miles

with a two-inch drill bit.

If we can go into space,
we certainly...

Well, space is easy.

It's empty.

We're talking
about millions of pounds

of pressure
per square inch.

Even if we somehow
came up with a brilliant plan

to fix the core,
we just can't get there.

Yes, but...

...what if we could?

Hello, Braz.

Why the hell
aren't you dead yet?

Okay, this way.

Well, that went better
than I expected.

Dr. Brazzleton,

I see you know Dr. Zimsky.

Yeah.

20 years ago,
he stole my research.

After that,
we-we kind of lost touch.

Research that
was equally mine.

That's funny,
I don't remember a check

from any of the patents.

All right, Braz.

20 years in the desert makes
you a prophet and a martyr.

Look, we're here
about your legendary ship.

Okay, I'm combining
high-frequency pulse lasers

with resonance tube ultrasonics.

If you've ever seen
ultrasonic waves

break up a kidney stone
on the Discovery Channel,

it's the same deal here.

You can...
put your helmets on now.

Firing.

Woo-ooh!

Woo-hoo!

Yeah. Oh.

Okay, I'm officially impressed.

So, all right.

So you've made some progress

with the engine,
we'll grant you.

Have you begun to think
about a shell?

Okay, this is Alex.

Okay, Alex. Good.

Okay, here we have
a concrete block,

and in back of that,
we have a two-inch steel plate.

Okay. We're ready.

And we are... firing.

Voila!

That's...

That's impossible.

I combined the crystals

in a tungsten-titanium matrix
at supercool temperatures,

and that's what did the trick.

The applications
for this are just...

What do you call this material?

Well, its real name
has 37 syllables.

I call it Unobtainium.

Unobtainium?

Mm-hmm.

The Unobtainium will take
the heat and the pressure

and transform it to energy,

which in turn, reinforces
the shell of the ship, you see.

So the hotter
and the deeper she gets,

the stronger she gets...
theoretically.

Theoretically?

Theoretically, yes.

This... is Johnson,
don't mind him.

This is the prototype
for the cockpit here.

Excuse me,
Dr. Brazzleton,

when do you think
the ship will be operational?

When I get my fabrication
methods perfected...

12... ten years, ten years.

What would it take to get
it done in three months?

$15 billion. I...

Will you take a check?

Why don't you use a credit card?
You get miles.

Mm.

Shit!

Mr. Finch, this is the FBI.
We have a warrant.

Purge!

Come on, purge!

FBI! Freeze!

Okay.

I know these
look like computers.

Totally not.

Theodore Donald Finch.

Carnegie-Mellon University.
M.I.T.

Worked at the Sun,
Lucent, Rand Corp.

My handle's "Rat."
Call me Rat.

63 computer fraud indictments.

64.

Two convictions.

This is strike three, Mr. Finch.

Wait a second.

You guys aren't here
to whack me, are you?

Because I was really,
really hoping to have sex

before that happened.

Yeah. I've been told
by the FBl...

whose database you crippled
last year...

that you are
the best in the business.

So you're about
to be given a choice.

What if I say no?

Excuse me, but is this really

the best we could do?

I mean...

How many languages do you speak?

Five, actually.

Well, I speak one.

One, zero, one, zero, zero.

With that, I could steal
your money, your secrets,

your sexual fantasies,
your whole life,

any country, any place,
anytime I want.

We multitask
like you breathe.

I couldn't think
as slow as you if I tried.

Do you have any idea...?

Okay, hey. Hey!

Let's just, let's give
the kid a break.

Okay, it's a phone.

It's just a phone.

Rat, we got a big problem.

A lot of people
are going to die.

We need your help.

What kind of help?

Information control.

We need you to control the flow
of information on the Internet.

You're dreaming.
Nobody controls the 'Net.

Could you...
with unlimited resources?

You want me to hack the planet?

He wants me to hack the planet.

You've got free long distance

on that phone... forever.

Okay.

If I decide to do this...

I'm going to need
an unlimited supply

of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets.

Hot Pockets?

They help me concentrate.

Sounds fair.

Major Childs,
they're ready for you.

Major Childs,

a clarification:

You and you alone
were responsible

for proposing
the descent vectors

for the shuttle, correct?

Yes, General.

We have determined that
the Class "A" landing mishap

experienced by
the Shuttle EndeavOur

was caused by biased
navigational data

from the ground due to a brief
geomagnetic disturbance.

Major Childs,
the resourcefulness you showed

in determining
the descent vectors proved

that you have exceptional
navigation skills.

You've brought much credit
upon yourself,

the space program
and the United States Air Force.

Congratulations, Major.

You are reassigned

with Commander Iverson
and Flight Director Stickley

to a new mission
effective immediately.

Transportation
is waiting outside.

Good luck and Godspeed, Major.

Are you sure you want
to wear this tie?

Why?

I don't know.

I mean, you look so
nervous about it.

You look so...

So, how are you holding up?

Oh, hi. I'm good, I'm good.

I'm about to tell
a couple hundred people

the world is going to end.

Well...

I've had better days.

You look good.

Well, no, you don't look good.

Why did he touch his tie
like that?

Thomas, let me speak
with you for a moment.

Listen, wouldn't you
rather I did this?

I mean, given my reputation,
I think that...

No. No, Keyes is in
the lead here, Zimsky.

Yes. Thomas, this is
the most important

scientific operation
in history.

And given my status, I feel that
it's my job to present...

Project Destiny
was your job, Zimsky.

And you went way beyond
authorized limits.

And let me tell...
And let me tell you,

I still, I want to know
if Destiny caused this problem.

It's highly unlikely,
but it may be the solution.

Now, I have not
finished checking...

Excuse me.

Rebecca...
I'm so glad I was wrong.

Right over left...

No, the other left,
the other left.

Gentlemen.
And then you...

Gentlemen.

Commander Iverson,
Major Childs,

this is your crew:

Dr. Brazzleton knows the ship;

Hello.

Dr. Zimsky knows the planet;

Doctor.

Dr. Leveque knows
the weapons system;

Excuse me, ladies first.

Hi.

And Dr. Keyes...

Dr. Keyes built
the navigation system, so...

Hi. Rebecca Childs.

Bob Iverson.

These are your fellow...
fellow... what?

Terranauts?

Hello.

All this brain power over here

is starting to smell
like burning batteries.

Y'all better come and join in.

Yeah.

It's the simplest things
that are the hardest, huh?

Yeah. It's official.

I'm the least-qualified person
on this base.

Dr. Keyes,
I'm sure the people in charge

have every confidence in you.

Well, the problem is that
I'm in charge.

Yeah, I know.

Can I help you?

Yes, please.

You're an astronaut,
and you can tie a Windsor?

Mm-hmm.

Is there anything you can't do?

Not that I'm aware of.

I find that
incredibly intimidating.

Yep. Most people do.

Here.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Let me introduce our project
leader, Dr. Joshua Keyes.

Thank you, thank you.

Good evening. Good evening.

Wow. This looks like a meeting

for Nobel Prize Winners
Anonymous.

I know you are all
the finest in your fields

and have come a long way
to be here.

So, I'll outline our program
over the next three months.

Dr. Brazzleton will supervise
the building of a ship

which is capable of reaching
the center of our planet.

Once there, it will deliver
an explosive charge

large enough
to restart its core.

Dr. Zimsky will calculate

the scale
of the explosion needed.

This is a program I designed
to simulate the effect

of nuclear detonations
on the core.

If my calculations are correct,
a tiny nudge in any direction

will force the core back
into its normal flow.

What's a "tiny nudge"
in planetary terms?

A thousand megatons,
give or take?

Tops. Because any more than that

would create
a core instability.

We made a few monster warheads
in the 200-megaton range.

Braz, do you think the ship
can handle five of these babies?

Yeah. I can enlarge
the ejection pod...

Forgive me,

but, you know, I know
I'm not the expert here,

but what if the core
is thicker or thinner?

I mean, what if it's not
what you think it is?

Isn't that going to affect
the way the explosions are...?

Yes, yes, yes, yes.

And what if the core
is made of cheese?

This is all best
guess, Commander.

That's all science is,
is best guess.

So my best guess is
you don't know.

With luck, irony will break
for the good guys for once,

and the world's biggest weapons
of mass destruction

will help save the world.

The ship will be powered

by a small experimental
nuclear reactor.

It will be divided
into six compartments

like cars on a train:

The locomotive unit,
navigation compartment,

living quarters, engineering,
bomb compartment

and finally
the weapons-control module.

Up to a 45 degree angle, every
compartment will be held level

by these gyro control gimbals.

But if we do breach a section,

bulkhead doors engage
automatically,

seal off the section in red,
and eject.

Is ejection really
the best option?

Only option.

Each damaged compartment
degrades the entire hull.

The objective is simple.

The obstacles are gigantic.

We're going to need
all the help in the world,

but if we are to avoid
panic and chaos,

the world at large can never
know what's happening here.

Which is where our friend
Mr. Rat comes in.

It's called Virus-bot.

It's a computer virus
that will seek out files

anywhere on the Web that contain
keywords that we designate

and wipes them out.

This is my Kung-Fu,
and it is strong.

Meanwhile, there are
a million puzzles ahead of us,

and we have three months
to solve them.

We have a committed
and ingenious team.

We have every resource available
to us,

and we have the best

of the world's scientific and
technical talents on our side.

With your help we can,
we must... succeed.

Feedback in the resonance tube.

Talk to me, gentlemen.

We are losing

structural integrity.

No, it's not feedback.

It's an impeller malfunction,
I believe.

No, it's not, no. If it were
an impeller malfunction...

For God's sakes, Braz,
make the call!

No, I'll make the call.
I should make the call.

65 knots.

Depth, 8-5 thousand feet.

Look, guys...

It's a disaster!

What part of "talk to me"
don't you guys understand?

For the 22nd time in a row,

everyone on Earth is dead.

Let's take a little quiet time,

and you all are going
to try this again.

Hi.

Hi.

What is this?

Well, it's...
I invented it.

It's how you're going to...
going to steer underground.

It's, um...

not very good reception.

Well, you're looking

through three feet of lead
at 50 yards away, so...

it ain't bad.

It's like a CAT scan
at a hospital,

but it's-it's souped-up.

I invented it

for Deep Earth surveying.

And then the government came in,
bought my research,

paid off my student loan guys
and made me a consultant.

I'm sorry,
this is really delicate.

And I have it
just the way I want it.

So... excuse me.

Uh, yeah.

Then they brought me in
when the pacemakers quit,

and... boom...
you know, I'm Apocalypse Boy.

Apocalypse Boy?

Yeah. I'm having T-shirts
made up.

Well, hats sell better.

You know, it's funny,
because that is...

right where it should be.

Well...

I'm sorry. I'm a little
ragged around the edges.

I'm just trying to get
this thing to focus correctly.

This is really cool,
but can I just...?

Well... mm-hmm.

It's better.
It's better. Uh...

God, I hate this sky.

Crashing one ship
isn't enough for you?

Hey. Practice makes perfect.

You can practice all you like.

It doesn't mean you're ready
to sit in that seat.

So you keep reminding me, sir.

You know, I doubt

you're even going
to listen to this,

but I'm going to give it a shot.

Being a leader
isn't about ability.

It's about responsibility.

Got it, sir.

No, you don't, Beck.

I mean,
you're not just responsible

for making good decisions.

You have to be responsible
for the bad ones.

You got to be ready
to make the shitty call.

What makes you think
I'm not?

Because you're so good.

You haven't hit anything
you couldn't beat.

I mean, hell,

you were the one who figured out
how to save the shuttle.

You made me, you made the rest
of NASA just look like an ass.

It's just that
you're used to winning...

...and you're not really
a leader until you've lost.

$20 billion has been spent
developing this system...

Oh, come on, guys,
the chefs at NASA...

I want wine!
I need wine!

It's about nutrition.
In five days, I think...

Whoa!

That's high-level
static discharge.

I think we should
check this out.

This doesn't look so good.

It's a lightning superstorm.

Popping up all over the world.

Got 'em. Tracking.

Uh-oh. Rome does not look good.

This planet is decaying faster
than we thought.

It's just the start.

Soon they'll be EM spikes

and microwaves will break
through the weak spots and...

All right. Get this ship
in the ground. Now.

Ah! Summer in the Pacific.

Yeah, the world is inside out.

I was saving this for later,
but...

this is the time for...

Josh, do you mind?

No, not at all. Yeah.

We should have a name
for this baby.

Oh, she's called virgil,
actually.

Virgil... the poet that led
our man into the depths of hell?

That's it.

That's appropriate, I guess.

Well, here's to virgil.

To the planet.

To virgil.
To virgil.

No flashbulbs, no press,
nobody cheering.

It's... weird.

Let's go.

Cabin pressure, TSI, 3.5.

Check.

ECS cabin repress open.

And repress VLV closed.

Check.

Fluid dump valve.

We are about to begin
our journey

into the heart of the cosmos,

into the very core
of our own planet.

Close.

Where we find therein...
Check.

The secrets of the universe...

...3.5 PSI.

...the mysteries of time...

LM circuit lockup.

Check.
...hope for the future.

And signal.

Deep Earth Control,
this is virgil.

Signal check.

This is Deep Earth Control.

I have thumbs-up
across the board.

You are clear
to initiate power-up.

Reactor power confirmed.

At 1,000 rpm, we will countdown
to launch. On your mark.

Pad leader, stand by for launch.

All right, virgil.

Mark.

Gantry count. Ten, nine,

eight, seven, six, five, four,

three, two, one...

launch.

500 feet.

Leveling out.

Okay, guys,
let's swing forward.

800 feet.

Light 'em up, Beck.

Gyro leveling operational.

Hull integrity holding.

I'm going to keep her nose
down about 15 degrees and...

Oh, my goodness.

They're singing to us.

Virgil's resonance tubes
are powered up,

so they're vibrating
sub sonically.

Actually, we're singing to them.

What's our depth?

1,600 feet,
plenty of room on both sides.

Hull integrity is good.

You sure?

Let's increase impeller speed.

I think we'll be needing
additional control.

Stick, I'm getting
a seismic reading.

What's happening?

T-phase.
Underwater earthquake.

Still think the water-launch
was a good idea?

Yes, yes, I chose this location
because the crust is thin here.

The downside is... there's lots
of seismic activity.

4,000 feet.

You see that rock?

That is not good.

We're losing steering here.

There's some kind
of crosscurrent.

14,000 feet.

Okay, guys, fasten
your seat belts.

We're turning into the skid.

18,000.

18,500.

They're going way too fast.

21,000 feet.

We hit the wall,

we're rabbits on the highway.

Pressure, pressure,
pressure, pressure.

What do you mean, pressure?

I thought you said this
thing was indestructible!

I said the pressure
makes us stronger.

We just don't have
enough of it yet.

We're at 25,000 feet.
Pull out, sir.

Can't.

What?
We're locked in.

Go to full throttle.

Standby to engage front
and lateral lasers, please.

But what if we hit bottom
in ten seconds here?

Just give it
a couple more seconds.

The lasers will fire.

No, there's not enough time
for power-up.

27,000 feet.

The lasers will deploy.

29,000 feet.

Do it!
And...

Do it! Now.

And we've got a signal.

All right.
Yeah!

All right.

Switching on electron spin burst
transmitters.

Plotting through
lowest density material,

reconfiguring
every five minutes.

Hull integrity 100%.
Reactor power 100%.

All green
on the bomb compartment.

Speed is 60 knots.

Hot damn.

All right, we'll be through
the crust in 15 minutes

and into the mantle.

24 hours to the core, and
then assuming we survive...

Assuming?
Yes, assuming.

Another 15 hours to the
inner core-outer core border.

They're doing well.

The crust is just rock.

Now it gets interesting.

Virgil, can we get
a status check?

We're about to make
the transition into the mantle.

Come on, come on.

Well, exterior pressure
is 800,000 pounds

per square inch.

And hull integrity is 100%.

It is as if we we're diving
through the memories

of the planet.

But we are about to pass
from memory

into madness.

Are you going to be doing
that Carl Sagan narration

all the way to the core?

I beg your pardon?
I said...

l-I have an obligation to
my students, to my readers...

An obligation to make
a book deal perhaps?

Two book deals,
if you'd like to know the truth.

I read that last book.
It wasn't very good.

Oh, really? Really?

When did you learn how to read?

People.

Drs. Zimsky and Keyes?

You guys are
our resident geophysicists.

What do you make of this?

The mantle
is a chemical hodgepodge

of... a variety of elements...

Say it with me:
"I don't know."

Well, Commander,

wise men say, "When in doubt,
you should go around."

No. It's too big.

We turn too slow.

Anything that
we can't go through

displays as black.

So what's... what's static?

It's nothing.

What do you mean?

It's nothing.

It's empty space.

I...

I never taught the computer
how to read empty space.

And I never taught virgil
how to fly.

Oh, God!

Oh, no, man!

Oh, dear God.

Serge, you all right?

Yeah.

Anybody hurt?

No. You okay?

Yeah.

What's that?
What is that?

From the cooling system.
Shut that down.

Shut it down.

I told you to go around her.

Nobody listens to me.

Where in God's name are we?

Whatever has us jammed up
is inside our lasers.

Shut 'em down.

We're not going anywhere.

Powering down.

Josh, is there any other image
you can pull up?

Nope.

Whatever it is, it's also inside
our MRI cameras.

We have to go outside.

What?

Believe me,
I hate to admit it,

but I think he's right.

I'm coming.
I want to collect samples.

Wait, hang on, hang on.

Wait, wait,
the first problem is,

the only way out of the ship...
is the way we came in,

which is through
the impeller outlet...

Which is still
at 5,000 degrees.

Exactly, I mean...

I'll just flush it
with liquid nitrogen

from the cooling system.

Wait. The cooling system

that's keeping us from
roasting to death in this ship?

Well, just a small part of it.

Alternatives?

Anybody.

Whoa, whoa, that's it.

It's like a giant...
giant crystal.

Where the hell are we?

Well, the good news is,

it looks like the suits
can take the pressure.

It's completely jammed
the laser assembly.

We just...
we got to hope,

if we can cut it loose,

they're still functional.
Careful!

Okay.

Got it.

Beck, try the lights, will you?

Lighting up.

Oh, it's magnificent.

Oh, my God.

Aladdin's cave.

It's like
a crystal Grand Canyon.

I think it's a geode.

But I don't understand

how it could have survived
down here.

Cobalt shell, maybe?

No. L-I mean,

in a magma environment
of 5,000 degrees.

Something would have
to protect it.

Unbelievable.

Zimsky.

Yeah?

We're inside
a giant gem bubble,

wrapped in a cobalt cocoon

700 miles below the surface
of the Earth.

Hell of a day.

Yes, it is.

I'll start cutting.

Okay, Braz.

I'm going to check the hull.

Call me if you need me.

Okay.

Oh, no.

Zimsky!
Yeah?

Zimsky, look!

It's an amethyst.

Oh, God,

we've breached the shell.

Guys, you don't have to be here!

I want you back inside!

Well, I think that means me.

Orders are orders.

Wait, Josh.

The problem is
I'm losing oxygen.

Braz, what can I do?

Check the feeds for me.

Check the feeds for me, Josh.

Quick!

I'm coming. I'm coming
as fast as I can.

Hey, guys, at this rate

we have three minutes
before the lava gets to us.

Come on, guys.

Come on.

It's not going to work
without oxygen!

We're losing oxygen!

I fixed it. Now cut!

That's good. It's working now.

It's working well now!

That's good, Josh!
