100 years ago,

this island in Taiwan...

had nothing

Only romance

Legend has it

There were two lovers

And one day

The man was fishing

His boat sank

The woman...

saw it onshore

She swam out

No one ever saw them again

Some say

they became dolphins

All dolphins around this island...

came from them

They all make...

"Bu...Bu" noises

Nice story?

So snooty

You told a horror story

Don't get involved

Have some melon

No

You're like...

those dolphins

So picky

You named me Bu

I've told you so often

Don't mix Mandarin...

with Cantonese

Bu's Mandarin and Cantonese...

are now both accented

That's awful

You teach her Mandarin then

Get off my case

That's Cantonese again

Which I don't speak

What did you say?

T ell me

Skipper Restaurant

Open bar, folks

One more round

Drink up

Go in and take a seat

Long time no see

One more round?

Not tonight

Can't afford it

On the house

Bu, 6 beers, on me

They come everyday

Never pay

Add water...

to the beer

That trick again?

Bu Yes?

Hurry

Here

Did you add water?

No!

No, very good

C'mon

Cheers

Why, Bu?

Idiot

You could've spared me

They sing

Watch TV

Or pick fights

This island

Has no room...

for romance

Done

Beautiful

I learned it...

from a magazine

Bu

I brought you something

I've never seen...

an oyster this big

Any pearls?

No

Must be expensive

NT$3,000

Thanks

And this

It's my friend's shop

He'll give us a discount

I'm...

Proposing?

No, I just want to...

Yes, I'm proposing

With...

a big oyster?

Of course not

The oyster's not...

Marry me

Okay

I'll consider it

Poor Longyi

This oyster's not cheap

He proposed to me

Really?

You love him?

Well, he's actually...

Not bad

Your answer

Shouldn't be over 4 words

You love him, or you don't

You left Hong kong...

to marry dad, why?

He was quite a hunk

A good cook too

You're a good cook

He's better

He cooks with love

What's loving someone like?

You miss him

The sight of him thrills you

You ache

When he's gone

You could watch him forever

Even when he's sleeping

You're in love

If you feel like that

Okay?

You miss Hong kong?

Yes, especially its Chinese Pot Rice

I see

You don't love Longyi

Take mama's advice

Trust your heart

Do what you have to do

Bu

Hey, kid

Got some news

Longyi proposed

Don't laugh

Somebody said

Men and women...

exist in pairs

Till separated on earth

Then they go through life

Searching for one another

Bu

Where are you going?

Bu!

I'm waiting for you!

Hong kong, Albert?

How romantic!

You're telling me something?

You choose for me

You just decided my future

Excuse me

You know a good cafe?

Sure, we'll go together

Thanks

Typical Taiwanese!

Pardon me?

You speak Cantonese?

Surprised?

Never flown before?

It shows?

Yes

You can get lost in Hong kong

I'll show you around

I know...

all the trendy spots

I have fans everywhere

I'm a fun guy

Okay?

What?

Are you twins?

Please forgive me

Excuse me

Gangster's girlfriend

disappears

Morning, sir, working out?

No time

Bill, are you ready?

Good

Let's start

Morning, Mr. Chan

Any news from Wall Street?

Lion Fund...

is borrowing heavily

Even at...

a 20% interbank rate

Check the following

How many Nikkei Futures...

did they short?

Is Yen...

appreciating?

Is the lease for the US base...

in Japan expiring?

If both answer are affirmative

Buy whatever they sell

But this hedge fund

Is run by 2 Nobel Prize economists

Should be invincible

They're too greedy

on margin trading

Leveraging 1 0 times their worth

They're doomed

So go ahead

Yes, Mr. Chan

Thank you

Send this with 1 00 roses...

to Carman

During office hours

Didn't you break up?

We're still friends

Find someone and

settle down

Like who?

Those women around you

All so beautiful and elegant

Too elegant for me

What do you want?

Someone amusing

Make yourself at home

That bottle floated to Taiwan!

And you came...

all that way

How brave and romantic

However...

What?

I...

What?

I'm gay

No

Yes

Really?

Really

No

Yes

Honest?

Honest

The bottle's for your boyfriend?

Ex-boyfriend

What?

Ex-boyfriend

Such a waste

Why?

You're a hunk

I'm not

That's stunning

That's what inspired you

I moved here because of it

Find a motel tonight

Fly home tomorrow

I've never traveled

This is a first

Think I'll stay a while

But Hong kong...

is boring

Fly back tomorrow

My friend said

Hong kong's fun

Great restaurants too

I'll find you...

a motel

I can't afford one

Hands off Wait

Let me stay here

Women can't stay here

I'll go nuts

Please

Sorry Please

I came all this way

T o such a big let down

I don't deserve this

Goodbye

Bu

What?

Your suitcase

Your bag

I can't stand crying

Makes me feel so guilty

Okay, stay

I'll be your aide, in whatever you do

I'm a makeup artist

Best...

in Hong kong

Exquisite

That's it

Hold that

Good

I'm starving

We'll wrap soon

How much longer?

6 hours

What?

keep that door shut

We're reloading

You'll fog the film

You sound so nervous on the phone
What's the emergency?

No...no emergency

I just miss you. You don't miss me?

Sit down, I'll get you a drink

Tell me, what's going on?

Maybe you'd better go

C.N. you're cruising and

didn't invite me?

Why bother, here you are

The press says you're romancing my girl

You believe them?

Grow up, LW

Is it true?

Yes

We've been competing since grade school

You've been interested in...

our stock lately

I'm interested in all stocks,

not just yours

My associates and l

Hold a majority of the shares

You can't touch my company

We'll see

You're on my yacht

Dating my girl

And you talk to me like this

Why did you want me here?

For an apology

To make it easier on you

I'm leaving now

Call me...

to apologize in...

5 minutes

What time is it?

5:30

Why wear...

a watch

That can't tell time

I like the diamonds

Watch him

If he doesn't call me in five

Throw him overboard

But give him a buoy

Yes, boss

Call me

Bye, boss

Call him

Or you'll get wet

Make it snappy

I've got a hot date

Don't force us to do it

Get a buoy

Right

Come

Hands off

Easy

Almost

Bye

Here comes the buoy

It's Fatty

Fatty fell over

Don't go

Help him up

Over there

Scared me

You okay?

I'm fine

Call you

Where is he?

Where is he?

You okay?

Don't fall over again

You! He's here!

In the rear

Help...

Hold tight

Close

You see him?

No

Look again

Over there

He got away

Wait

The boss wanted him...

overboard with a buoy

Job's done, right?

Right

It's a wrap

Thanks

You okay?

You're...

Name's Bu

Bu?

You a refugee?

Yes

From Vietnam?

Right again

How many of you?

Just me, why?

Who's driving?

Give me a hand

I can't, I'm starving

Aren't you?

No, but I could use a snack

Let's talk

so I forget the hunger

About what?

What do you like?

Nothing?

Not even cars and women?

Don't just smile

Okay, what don't you like?

Nosy people

What don't you like?

Growing up,

I like being naughty

Nosy?

Naughty

Naughty

And no one...

pampers you anymore

What do you like?

A shower when I'm sweaty

Snap out of bed...

to a cup of coffee

I'd like one now

Hong kong stars are lovely

Stars are...

the same everywhere

If you care to look at them

What?

Shooting star!

Really?

Mom said when you see one

T ouch your pocket and make a wish

And it'll come true

But I'm out of luck, no pocket

Another one

What's your wish?

Can't tell you

Or it won't come true

I'm so sleepy

A boat! Help!

Over here!

The Silicon Valley stocks?

They'll go even higher

Check one thing

Does LW control...

his company's shares?

Buy me a new mobile

It drowned

There's no transport...

around here

I'll give you a ride

Just tell me where I am

and I'll walk back

We're out

in the boonies, Miss

Name's Bu

Boo? Bu!

Just get in

Sure

Not you, this lady here

There are only 2 seats

I know

Here's 20 bucks

Around the corner...

are buses and cabs

Compulsive liar

Come in

Huge place, you live alone?

There's a butler

Must get crowded

Wait here

Can I look around?

Help yourself

Thanks

I'm starving

Some food please!

Need something?

Fish food

They're electronic fish

Come over here

Why electronic fish?

I never change the water

Fish never die, it's perfect

And if the power's out?

You invite friends over?

Don't have any

So boring, and lonely

Now what?

You like to fight?

Some golf,

some race horses

I box and work out

What's the octopus for?

You're so nosy

Sorry

This should fit, change in there

Betty, call me a cab

20 minutes? Great

There's a room...

behind the mirror

How would I have known?

Hungry?

Starving

Me too

Any Chinese pot rice?

What?

Best take out food ever

My favorite

A fancy kitchen and you don't cook?

I hate the smell

Don't stare. Eat up

Sure

Now what?

You're amusing when you eat

Are you rich?

I guess so

What do you do?

I'm into trash

C'mon

No, I sell trash

Be that way

Can I have a soda?

Juice is better for you

Bu took the lift down

What's wrong?

Stop moaning

You know

That bottle's very special

So special that...

all of a sudden

I'm feeding and sheltering you

Just like that

Remember I told you about...

C.N.? More than once

Last night...

You told me that too

I think he's...nice

Nice?

These magazines are published weekly

And he changes girlfriends just as often

He's not nice, he's a playboy

Let's see

An ex-girlfriend says

He doesn't say sweet words

But he's a romantic man

He appears stem and talks tough

Inside he's like a kid

He's competitive and chases novelty

Never regrets any decision

With him...

You feel insecure

Meaning?

Chases novelty, so he fools around

No regrets,

so he enjoys dumping women

Maybe those women deserved it

They were insecure...

to begin with

Spare me

Hong kong's boring anyway

Going home?

No, C.N. is fun

You have to hook him first

Can't just walk up

And take off your clothes

That sure won't work

But you never know

He's competitive and

chases novelty

I have a plan, I need your help

No way

Please

Sorry

Please tell me

where your daughter is

She found a bottle

She's in Hong kong

I have to get Bu back

Chow Yun Fat!

Mr. Chow

Wrong guy

You speak Mandarin?

I'm not Chow Yun Fat

Don't try to fool me

Sir, is he Chow Yun Fat?

Mr. Chow, you're back!

Fresh form Hollywood?

Please sign Can I take a picture?

You mind? Ok

But... 1,2,3...say cheese

My turn, miss

Point a gun at me

Ready, 1, 2 Ready 1, 2, 3...

Thank you, Mr. Chow

Give me a hug

Thank you Mr. Chow Thank you

I'll send you the photos

Bye You're so sweet

Same as the photo

Print me a copy

He's such a hunk Bye

Bye

My bag!

We checked LW's company

Last year,

rumover grew 1 3%

Profit: over Hk$1 billion

Stock price is undervalued by 30%

We have acquired...

1 6% of the company

LW and his associates...

still hold 65%

But...

they're not selling

Dump all my stocks

If we dump them,

the price will plunge

We bought high, we'll take a huge loss

Just do it

I need to see k.k.

Yes, sir

Who's k.k.?

Head of Environmental Protection

Going up or down?

I was seeing friends upstairs

There's no upstairs

Really?

Actually they live downstairs

Names?

I forgot

So quiet here

Can you get an 80% mortgage?

You messed up my wall

Excuse me?

Look!

Easy there

Let go

Who sent you?

Let go first

Like my writing?

Enough. I don't know kungfu

I'm just a messenger

Message?

My back pocket

Bully. You messed up my arm

Cops will go after them

Not us

Hi, there

Sunny, sit...Sunny, sit

Thanks

Someone reported a fight

We were attacked

They leave any evidence?

Baseball bats

Sunny, smell

Any clues?

Sunny, you're clueless

Let's get help

My site, very safe

It's so trashy

I told you I sell trash

Expensive stuff too

Expensive? Trash is trash

Before you were...

a Vietnamese refugee

Now you're...

A Taiwanese gangster's girlfriend

So who are you, really?

A dangerous woman

Scared?

Never

Thrilled to be with me?

How'd you land the girlfriend's part?

I lived near a police station

with posters of wanted criminals

One of them was a hunk

I saw his poster everyday

And I fell in love

And?

I found him, stole his heart

How was he?

Cute, a great dancer

Really romantic

For being a dancer?

You dance?

Of course

This?

Sure

Tango?

That too

So common, nothing more exciting?

Sure Really?

Teach me

You'll be scared

No way

Hold me

Give me your legs

Right

Ready?

Help!

Exciting enough?

Yes

No more?

You aren't scared?

Never

More moves?

Just hold tight and

stay still

Enjoy the variations

Really? Okay?

Okay...

There

Run, 1, 2, 3

Wow! This is fun

Man's so busy

Making trash

The recycling business is a gold mine

They say...

What others abandon, I take

You did well last time

Slapped Lion Fund in the face

They all know you're my protege

I'm flattered

Thank you

Don't thank me, thank yourself

Any new plans?

I heard you're buying LW's company

You know

what's the best win?

Winning one's battle...

with the enemy's respect

Stock Exchange's closed

And?

Our stock dropped 20%

Closed at $6.50

Our drop in asset value?

Over 2 billion

It's Chan,

he's dumping our shares

What's the news on him?

Rumors are he wants...

to buy our company

Then...

why dump his shares?

After buying them so high?

What's he up to?

Boss

What happened to you?

We wanted to get even. We ambushed Chan

Was he hurt?

Not a scratch

Thank God

Else...

I'd blame myself

And if...

Well,

you actually were hurt

And see, I feel guilty

It was your dad's idea

He screwed up

Ordering an ambush

Why not shoot Chan in the back?

That's much faster

Let's do it

No, it's wrong, it's cowardly

Challenge him openly

Right

Yes!

Let's hire a fighter from overseas

Tougher

Smaller

And...

Handsomer than Chan

He'll be devastated

What's that?

The signal means "Dismissed". Beat it

Tricky signals

Have you seen her?

That's Mary

No, that's Bunny

No, that's Mary

That's Bunny, come with me

No, that way

No

Another Bunny?

A masseuse

A masseuse?

Why not?

Oh my God, what's he doing?

Albert!

Do I look pretty?

Yes

What?

Your outfit

My Sunday best

Go to...

Jean-Paul's Boutique

I'll call him,

Iet him dress you

You feed, shelter,

and clothe me

You're my guardian angel

Your wish is...

my command

Bye

What?

How should I behave at dinner?

You're playing a gangster's lady

Use method acting

Teach me

Just act snooty

Feed, shelter, and clothe her

I'm an angel

She forgot something?

Yes?

Help!

It's you!

Where's Bu?

Please tell me where she is

Mr. Chan

Thanks

Mr. Chan
