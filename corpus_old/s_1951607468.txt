Oh, thank you very much.

Uh, may I trouble you
for a pillow?

Sure.

Great. Thank you.

Excuse me.

I guess we're going
to be a while.

Ha ha ha!
You're funny.

The temperature in Miami...

is currently 86 degrees
and muggy.

We will be starting
our descent for landing...

in just a few moments.

Herman Gotlieb...

Gotlieb.

Please remain seated
with your seat belts on...

until the captain has
turned off the seat belt sign.

All passengers
holding tickets...

to Eastern Flight 162
to Tampa...

please come
to the ticket counter.

Hey.

Wow! Thanks.

All passengers leaving
on Flight 266...

please go directly
to the check-in desk...

at Gate 6.

All passengers leaving...

Hi.

Please go directly
to the check-in desk...

Hi.

Hi there.
Going home?

I'd like to tell you
about a book.

It's a classic
of the Vedic literature...

"The Knowledge of God."

Have you seen
the movie "Gandhi?"

My name's Ravindra.
What's your name?

Trouble.

Mr. Gotlieb...

You know,
anything you want.

Hey, send me up
a girl, Pablo. Now.

You got any
of that hundred...

I gave you last week?

I got all of it, man...

but I'm not lending you
no more money.

Come on, Blink.

Look. 50 bucks
till payday.

Moseley. Homicide.

A what died?

All right.
Right away.

I'll pay to find
the dumbbell killers.

What's it worth to you?

$61.35.

$65.59.

Thanks, Blink.

Hey, man,
replace your teeth.

Hi.

Pablo sent me.

How old are you, anyway?

19...and my name is Pepper.

You got a driver's license
on you, Pepper?

What's wrong
with Susan Waggoner?

You know, Susie...

this license here says
you're 23 years old.

I know what it says.

You can call me Junior.

You around a size 7?

Where?

Dress.

Oh.

Uh, 6.

Sometimes 7.

Depends on...

Here. Try this on.

Could you turn
around, please?

Thank you.

Can you zip me up?

Yeah.

Oh...

it looks nice to me.

You want me to wear it?

Fuck, no.

I want you to buy it.

50 bucks.

It might be worth a suck.

Is that what you're
getting for a suck...

these days, 50 bucks?

Christ.

Where did you get
all these nice things?

Oh, when I left my wife
I took 'em with me.

Figured I paid for 'em,
they're my clothes, right?

You left your wife?

How long you been
working for Pablo?

Since the beginning
of the semester.

I go to Miami-Dade.

l...I'm majoring
in business...

but I also take
English classes.

Yeah, well...

the first thing they
should have taught you...

at your hooker classes...

is you shouldn't
ask the clients...

so many fucking
personal questions.

I'm sorry.

Are you going to call down
and cancel me now?

That's OK.
Don't feel bad about it.

Um, I hope, uh...

the next girl's
more to your liking...

and I hope that you enjoy
your stay in Florida...

Mr. Gotlieb.

I'm giving you
your dress back.

No, forget
about the dress.

Honey...

did I upset you?

I'm sorry.

So you want me to stay?

OK, then.

Let's do it.

Ready?

Turn over.

Is something wrong?

I haven't been
with a woman...

in a long time.

Wow.

I'm sorry.

Nobody kisses us.

Pepper.

OK, Henderson, what's up?

These two Krishnas have
been working the airport...

for a couple of months.

Now they'd been warned about
bugging the passengers.

Should've listened.

How was he killed?

He fucked with some guy...

wearing a suede
leather sport coat...

so the guy takes
his finger...

bends it back, breaks it,
then disappears.

Now the witness lady says
she thinks that, uh...

well, he hopped on one of
the hotel courtesy vans.

We got a partial
description.

Wait a minute.

The Krishna died
of a broken finger?

I mean, is that a homicide?

Well, I guess
he died of shock.

Well, it hurts like hell...

to have your finger
bent back.

My sister used to do it
to me when I was a kid.

Yeah, but you didn't die.

Now, if this
was an accident...

it would be
simple assault, right?

However...if the guy
in the suede sport coat...

knew that Krishnas
had a bad habit of dying...

every time you bent
their finger back...

-Murder one?
-Yeah.

Well, the guys
at the station...

are going to laugh
their asses off...

Your turn to notify
next of kin.

No way! I did the fat lady
that sat on a kid.

That's good for 2.

Next week?

I'll be retired by then.

Ah, shit.

Well, you try the hotels.

See if anyone got off
one of their courtesy vans...

wearing a suede sport coat.

Ah, shit.

This is good here.

Oh, excuse me.

Maybe we should try
in here.

All right.

Price check.
Uzi squirt gun.

Disregard.

What's up?

Got something for me?

I got the goods.

Whoa!

In the bag. Now!

Up against the wall. Now!

Be cool, brother.

Hey, he's got a gun!

Let's get out of here!

Move it!

Give me a day's notice
before it runs out, OK?

Wednesday.

Tell me Tuesday.

Looky, we got
a million dollars.

We got a million...
Brazilian dollars.

Absolutely worthless.

"That's a lot
of money, man.

"That's a lot of
fucking money.

"I don't think you are
a Porsche customer...

"Mr. Frenger.

"I don't think you really
want to buy a Porsche.

Do you want to buy
a Porsche?"

No, man! I'm here
to waste my time.

How much for
the speedboat, man?

"Oh, the speedboat is
very expensive, sir.

That speedboat is $50,000."

Wrap it up, man.

Yeah. The bellman said...

some guy matching
the description...

got off a courtesy van.
Registered. Yeah.

Got a name?

Name was, uh...
Herman Gotlieb.

Yeah. I'm in the room
right now.

Coat's here, too.

Coat? What else?

Well, the bellman
also said...

the guy had
a hooker with him.

-A hooker?
-Yeah.

No lie?

I got an address on her.

An address?

Oh, man.

Got a pen handy there,
Hoke?

Give me the hooker's
address.

-Hi!
-Hey.

You showed up.

I brought you
a present.

Oh, really?
I got you one, too.

A present from a client.

Well, hey, I'm more
than a client.

"Shit happens when
you party naked!"

Look at us.

I was just gonna get you
the plain "Shit happens..."

but I thought you'd like
the "party naked" part.

Hey, that's the best part.

Hi. Um, circe salad, Noira.
It's real good, Junior.

Two.

Right away.

So, uh, Susie...

tell me how you wound up
living in Miami.

Oh, I got a job
at a Burger World...

up in Hollywood...

and I was gonna, you know...

save up and get
my own franchise...

but Pablo offered me
this job.

Well, it pays
a whole lot better.

This is a nice cup, Junior.

I'm gonna get a lot
of use out of this.

It's a good cup.

Hey, did you see
the swimmers?

That's why
I picked this place.

They do, like,
a water ballet.

Ballet in the water.
I like it.

'Cause I like
to swim myself.

I'd rather do that kind
of work, you know?

But you gotta train
for a long time.

So now I want to take
a Spanish course in college.

You know, in my business...

a lot of people don't
speak English...

so I think I'd
be better at it...

if I spoke...thank you.

We'll take
the check now.

Yes, sir.

You know, like,
well, Cuban, also.

And I think that's sort
of like Spanish...Cuban...

but it's
a little different.

This ice cream dressing
is sour as shit.

It's yogurt dressing,
not ice cream.

Where you been?

Oh, that's OK.

I never had
yogurt dressing...

up in Okeechobee.

Where is that?

That's where I'm from.

You heard
of Lake Okeechobee.

I'm from California.

I don't know shit
about Florida.

You ever heard
of Lake Tahoe?

Lake Tahoe?

How is it?

Lousy.

Who is he?

We're engaged.

Hey, separate checks.

My treat.

Good luck.

Hey, Susie...

we're not gonna be
calling it a night, are we?

I got a homework paper.

I gotta write a haiku
for English class.

I tell you what.

I'm real good
at making up things...

you know, poems.
I could come over.

I could help you
write your, uh...

Haiku?

Definitely.

Let's get out of here.

Thank you. I'm sorry.
I liked the food.

Bye.

So you think this
unidentified assailant...

who broke, uh...

Ravindra's finger
did it on purpose?

Sorry, uh...Ramba.

That's all right. Heh.

That was a short engagement.

Hey, you know,
you still haven't told me...

what it is you do.

Oh, I got investments.

I take people's money
and put it to work.

You got any?

I got a $10,000 CD...

and I take
the interest from that...

and I put it
into a N.O.W. account.

Jesus Christ.

That's the biggest
frigging racket going.

I want you
to march straight down...

to the bank first thing
in the morning...

and cash in both
of those things.

I can't let my fiancee
get ripped-off...

when I can
double your money.

-Double?
-Yeah.

How 'bout that poem
we were gonna write?

We make love a lot.

We make love right now.

No. It's seven
in the second line.

Seven in the second line?

Splashes around
in his pond...

Could you
close the door, please?

Thinking he's...

alone.

Breaking, entering...

the dark
and Ionely place...places.

Finding a...big gun.

Smelling like a rose.

Any luck?

I wrote 2. Heh.

Maybe I'll get extra credit.

Hey, where did you
get these?

Dumb question.

-Are you a nosy rosy?
-Mm-mmm.

What the hell
was that, man?

The doorbell.

Talk about dumb questions.

Susan Waggoner?

Can I come in?

I bet you're
Herman Gotlieb.

How much?

Sergeant Hoke Moseley.

Homicide.

Herman Gotlieb.

I'd like to ask you
a few questions. Routine.

Boy, you got
a grip there, Herman.

Been working out?

Can I get you
a cold one there, Sarge?

Well, why not?

Two Polars, honey.

You down at the airport
today, Herman?

Yeah, I was.

Somebody broke
the finger off

a Hare Krishna...

and the son
of a bitch died.

No shit?

No shit.

I didn't do it.

Oh, no, no, no.

We're just looking
for someone...

who might have seen
anything.

I'm curious, uh...

you own
a suede sport coat?

Yeah, I do.

OK. You're probably
the one.

Did you get on
the courtesy van...

to the Grand Prix Hotel?

Hey, fuck
this nonsense, man.

You're misunderstanding
this, Herman.

Who got killed?

You know, if I had
something better to do...

like sit at home
with a beautiful girl...

I wouldn't even be
bothering you, but, uh...

you were mentioned
as a possible witness.

See anything?

We got this
forensic dentist.

And l, uh, I talked him
into pulling my teeth...

and fixing me
some new chompers.

Well, it took two months
of his spare time.

And I got so used to
drinking without 'em...

I just pull 'em out.

Bother you?

Junior...

you want me to fix
those pork chops now?

Hell, I'll put 'em
back in for pork chops.

Pork chops comin' up.

Herman...

your fiancee...

is the best cook
in South Florida.

More taters?

Junior?

So, Herman, where
did you do your time?

Time?

What do you mean?

Well, the way you're
guarding that food.

You know...

like another con could
take it away from you.

Well, I was raised
in foster homes, you know?

I didn't get no dessert
till I was in eighth grade.

Damn.

I got a daughter
in the eighth grade.

Half my paycheck goes
to her orthodontist.

She's got your teeth, man.

Yeah. The joint's
about the only place...

you got time to work out
to get a grip like that.

I was an aerobics
instructor.

Shoots the shit
out of that theory.

Any more Polars?

Oh...

Junior got
the last one.

I could run out
and get some.

Beer's gone, I'm gone.

You're kidding.

But, you know,
I gotta get...

that pork chop
recipe first.

No. Are you serious?

It's so easy, what I did.

You are definitely
not gonna have...

to write this down.

All it is is pork chops
in a frying pan.

And just cook 'em
in their own fat...

with a lot of salt.

Oh, well,
they sure were good...

but you know
what I really like...

is native Florida cooking.

Now, did you ever have
chestnut batter...

on your pork chops?

Boy, I never did.

You got a recipe
for that somewhere?

Uh, yeah, I do,
as a matter of fact.

I'll give it to you.
Just a minute here.

Oh, I appreciate that.

Great dinner.

Get you something
to go, Sarge?

Just you.

Kidding, Herman.

Listen, if you
think of anything...

just, uh, give me a call.

That's my home phone.

Look, it's a hotel...

and the old guy
at the desk is deaf...

so, uh, just let it ring
till he sees the lights.

Oh, and, uh,
when we round up...

the usual airport
hoodlums...

maybe you could shoot by and
take a look at a line-up.

Take you five minutes.

Oh, yeah.

You mind standing
in the line-up, too?

We're a little short
of bodies. Heh heh.

You ever stood
in a line-up before, Herman?

Never been caught, Sarge.

Ah, you ain't got
one beer rat-holed...

I can take with me
for the road, do you?

You got it all, man.
Dog biscuits, too.

Oh...see you.

Night, Susie.

Years ago, I started
preaching catch-and-release.

Back then, a lot of things
seemed to indicate...

that our bass resource in
many areas of the country...

was rapidly diminishing.

Today, there is
no doubt about it...

and I'm very concerned about
what the future holds...

for this great sport.

In simple terms...

we don't have the vast
water we once had...

and there are
several reasons for it...

pollution,
illegal netting...

the pressure of removing
too many adult bass...

from their environment.

You know, they're kind of
like money in the bank.

I got news for you.

I'm not coming back.
I'm married.

I am so married.

I gotta go. Bye.

You like ham and eggs?

Drop it.

It smells good.

Who was that, anyway?

Pablo.

The cops rousted him.

I guess they're giving him
a hard time because of you.

We got to go for
a little ride, honey.

What?

What about breakfast?

It was gonna be a surprise.

I was gonna bring it
in to you on a tray.

And then l...

Make it to go.

Not too tired
for some fun?

Call it a night, sister.

Aye, aye, sir.

I got something that
I gotta tell you.

I used to be in prison.

What did you do
to get there?

I used to rob people
who robbed people.

Kind of like Robin Hood?

Except I didn't
give the money...

to the poor people.

You don't do that
anymore, do you?

I got investments now.

Good. You got me
out of the life.

Now you stay out of crime.

Sounds good.

Promise?

Yeah, sure.
Why not?

Say you promise.

I promise.

Henderson?

Sanchez. Homicide.

Oh, my replacement.

How is he?

He's got a cervical
disc injury...

a dislocated jaw, bruises...

uh, got a concussion...
I don't know how bad it is.

Somebody really
worked him over.

Did he tell you
who did it?

What happened?

No. He's in and out
of consciousness.

Drop the knife, Pablo.

My name isn't Gotlieb.

Sergeant Hoke Moseley,
homicide.

That little girl
you sent up to my room?

She's 15 years old, man.

She's 23, man.
She's not 15.

Look. Sergeant Lackley
checked her I.D.

Why don't you call him?
I pay him every week.

Maybe you two guys
can get together.

How much you pay
Lackley every week?

$500 a week. Don't.

All right, from now on,
Lackley gets 250.

The other 250 to me...

at the Primrose Hotel.
You got it, man?

Lackley's not gonna go
for any split like that.

You tell the guy
at the desk...

to leave it for me
in the safe.

Hi. What can I get for you?

Uh...iced coffee.

Hey! What are you doing?

Open!

Open the goddamn
drawer now! Do it!

Stop or I'll shoot!

You just shot me.

I fired a warning shot
and it hit you.

You're no cop.

No problem.

There is no problem.

Police. Homicide.

You people go about
your business.

You finish your lunches,
your breakfasts, whatever.

Don't worry, lady.

I'm gonna call
an ambulance now...

on the radio
in my police car.

Yeah. I'll be right back.

Slow down.

Go ahead.

Stop right here!

Furnished?

Yeah, with almost antiques.

How much?

I been worried sick!

Where you been all day?

Dumb question.

Did you get the money?

I cashed in
the $10,000 CD...

but I decided to keep
the N.O.W. account open...

for 8 more days.

What did I tell you?

Huh?

They said if I keep it
open for 8 more days...

I'll be eligible
for a teapot.

I'm sorry.

It's just 8 more days.

You'll still be here,
won't you?

I don't know.

My problem is
that I can have...

everything and anything
that I want...

but I don't know
what I want.

Tell me again about that
Burger World franchise.

OK.

You need $50,000.

You borrow another 50,000
from Burger World...

and you wait for an opening.

But why?
What's the purpose?

To make a living,
that's all.

You hire kids, so you
can pay 'em nothing.

And you watch 'em
real close...

or they will
steal you blind.

And...and you save
your money...

and you buy
a nice little house...

with a white picket fence.

And you live
happily ever after.

I tell you what.
Let's go straight...

I can't see any point...

in hanging out
at a Burger World...

no matter how much money
you're gonna make.

It's stupid.

You can forget about
Burger World, honey.

I'm gonna
take care of you...

and you're gonna
take care of me.

That's our purpose.

Do you know any
married people today?

Hmm? They're a team.

They pull together,
and they get rich.

They got it all.

And you know
that little house...

you were just
talking about?

I rented us one
in Coral Gables today.

Oh, Junior.

That's what you were
up to all day?

I'm gonna take
such good care of you.

Mm-hmm.

He was a big guy, man.
Bigger than you.

Got up from the table,
said he was homicide.

Pulled a badge?

After he whacks the dude.

It was cold, man, ice cold.

Thanks, Blink.

What do I owe you?

It's on the house, bro.

Come on.

I like the air conditioning
on frozen.

Me, too.

1/2 ounce.
Primo, man.

Thanks, man.

Hey, half that's mine.

Fuck you! I sold it.
I keep the money.

These are my contacts.
They're my people.

I don't give a shit
about your contacts.

Police! Freeze!

Stand over there.

Put that on.
Right through there.

You know what to do,
Shorty.

Hey!

I don't believe this.

I'm gonna let
you two guys go...

with a little warning.

Don't get caught.

Shit!

Police! Don't move!

You can go now.

Give me your wallet!

Come on, man.
Move it...

Police! Drop it!

I said drop it.

Shoot him!

Make it, Julio.

Comprendo?

Yeah. Yeah.

That's my purse!

Stop him!

Stop! Somebody
please help me!

Go get him.

Thank you, officer.

Yeah, that's great, lady.

But...you're a cop!

Hey! Police! Police!

You have anything
against broccoli...

cauliflower,
stuff like that?

I don't want to talk
about that at this time.

Oh.

What are you going to do
now that we're married?

Take care of the house,
shop, fix dinner.

Take care of the babies.

Is that what
you'd like to do?

Be a mother?

Well, I don't...

I guess so.

l...I don't...
I don't know.

I lived with a girl
once for 2 months.

She didn't do anything...

a housewife was
supposed to do.

I thought you said
you were married.

I told you that before
I really knew you.

What I'm driving at,
Susie, is...

I want to have
a regular life.

I want to go to work
in the morning...

sometimes at night...

come home
to a clean house...

and a hot meal...

and a loving wife
just like you.

I don't want to have
any babies.

This world's a shit hole.

You think
you can handle that?

I do.

I do.

This is better
than counting money.

These yours?

I can't tell.

Yeah. This, uh...
nail polish.

We found two muscleheads
cuffed together.

Jesus!
He's making arrests?

We did some
routine prints.

They match those taken...

from the scene of
the dumbbell murders.

I've been working
that case for 15 months.

Find Gotlieb?

We're looking for him.

Ohh...let's get
the fuck out of here.

I'll find him.

Maybe you should wait
and let him solve...

a couple more from
your case load, huh?

Will you have
a seat, please?

Where, here?

Your name, please?

Ziffel. Fred Ziffel.

Is that the way you want
the account to read?

No. I want it to read
"Arnold Ziffel."

Here you go.

Thanks.

Hey, Eddie.

Here's the key
to your new suite.

Oh, and some Cuban kid
on a bicycle...

made two deliveries.

Uh, 250 in both.

I'm sorry.
I opened them.

It's OK, Eddie.

Thanks.

Uh-huh.

Who is it?

Lackley. Vice.

Slide your I.D.
under the door.

Are you fucking serious?

Try me!
Next thing you hear...

will be a bullet
coming through the door!

Pablo sent this.

What?

What's the matter, Sarge?
Got a guilty conscience?

I just got out
of the hospital.

I know all about you.

I like your place here,
too. It's very nice.

You also got
a little something...

that belongs to me,
don't you, Gums?

What the fuck
you talkin' about?

I never seen you
before in my life.

Now, listen, Sarge...

you think you're moving in
on my territory?

I think you better
cough up...

some "do-re-mi" right now.

500 bucks. Let's have it.

What 500 bucks?

What are you
talking about?

-Fuck off!
-Fuck off?!

You go to Pablo...

you cut yourself in
on my action.

You don't think
I'm coming after you?

Jesus Christ!
You got a lot of balls!

And Pablo wants the hooker
back on the job...

tomorrow at 10:00,
and all is forgiven, Gums.

What hooker?

10:00.

He got your gun
and your badge...

and your teeth.

You are a disgrace
to the police force.

Fuckin'
Junior "Bullshit" Gotlieb.

Hey, you got
a piece, Eddie?

Teeth?

No. A gun. I need it.

Hold on.

Hair trigger.

Hollow points.

Thanks, Eddie.

Right in here.

Where's Antonio?

On your feet, pal.

Turn around.

Move it.

Police raid!
Everybody freeze!

Run for it!

Yo! Hey, guys!

Come on back.
Where are you goin'?

Come on.
I got this covered!

At ease, officer.

I think you'd better
check with your superiors.

Remain silent.

Hey, I pay good money
to the right people, huh?

Were you out
at the airport today?

Was I out
at the airport today?

What, are you crazy?

You ever stood
in a line-up before?

Oh, yeah. I stood in
a line-up before.

OK. I want you to
line up there!

Hey, what the hell's
going on here?

Shut up!

You own a suede
sports coat?

Courtesy van?

You ain't no cop.

Oh, I'm a cop.

Prove it, slick.
You're not walking...

You crazy son of a bitch!

I'll kick the living shit...

Take it easy, Scanlan.

Hey.

Hey, Smiley.
How are you?

Ellita Sanchez?

Hoke Moseley.

I've been calling you.

Don't they have someone
at that desk to answer?

Yeah...but he's deaf.
Got something?

Prints I.D.
on those beer bottles.

That's the son of a bitch!

"Frederick J. Frenger,
Junior."

Junior Gotlieb.
I knew that was bullshit.

I got something
on the real Gotlieb.

Mugged. D.O.A...

at the San Francisco
Airport Hospital.

That sound
like Junior's M.O.?

Murder one.

We can nail him as the
Krishna finger killer, I bet.

He's grown up behind bars.

And look at this.

Someone charged
a suede sport coat...

on the real Gotlieb's
credit card...

after he was dead.

We got the motherfucker!

Thanks.

I'm sorry. Habit.

I ran his real name
by the utilities...

but I turned up nothing.

He wouldn't use
his real name.

Well, if he did...

we'd be knocking
on his door right now.

What about Waggoner?

I called every utility
in Dade.

Even bottled water.

I'm sitting here
having my lunch...

waiting for
a call back, OK?

Sitting on your lunch?

Try Broward.

Look, I know you think
I'm a weak suck...

but I don't care.

The guy who did this
to me...this Frenger...

Junior...he's got
my old badge, Sanchez.

He's running around
playing cop...

assaulting
and beating people.

I'm doing everything
I can to help.

Call me if you
hear anything.

Put the funny book down!

Give me the fuckin' cash...

or I'll blow
your fuckin' head off!

No, don't count it,
Goddamn it!

Police!

Drop the gun, son.

I know what it's like...

to be on the other end
of that gun.

You're making
a big mistake.

I tell you what...

you put down the gun,
give back the money...

and I'll let you
walk on out of here.

You walk out that door...

your life is
gonna change forever.

Hold your fire,
you asshole!

What the fuck?!

Hey.

Hey, you OK?

Hey, mister.

Get this thing off me.
I'm a cop.

I think I hit him.

You didn't hit shit.

Where is
the whipping cream?

We're out.

Oh, my God.

OK, I want you to do
something for me.

Go get me some
cotton balls...aah!

Some peroxide...

some bandages...

and bring me
a small mirror.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Oh, fuck me.

I want you to go
and get me...

your smallest needle...
a small needle...

and thread it
with black thread, OK?

Here. I got it.

Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

OK. Now...
I tell you what.

I want you to sew
my eyebrow back on.

Hey, hey!
Now, come on, come on.

Come on.
You're gonna be OK.

I got it.

I'm sorry.
I'm no good at this.

I got it.

What? OK.

I got you.

I'm going to
get you a doctor.

Oh, no. No doctors.

I want you to get me
a bottle of gin.

I nursed my husband for
3 years before he died...

but you're not
going to die.

Here.

It's gin, Junior.

Drink it.

We're going to need this.

This is going to hurt.

You move, and you're
a blind man. Scissors.

Hold it. Hold it.

You're doing real good,
Junior.

I'm just gonna
move down a bit.

Now we just have one more.

Just hold on.

That'll hold you.

Your husband must have
been glad to die.

Thank you.

Yeah, thanks.

You got a real nice
touch there, lady.

So...are you going to
tell me about it?

Yeah, I'll tell you
about it.

This straight life
that we've been living...

has been giving me this
misplaced sense of security!

I thought for
one minute there...

I was some kind of fuckin'
solid citizen or something.

All I want to know
is what happened to you.

Some guy in a blue
Toyota pickup ran me over.

I thought it must have been
something like that.

An anonymous, apparently
off-duty, police officer...

interrupted
a robbery tonight...

at a Coral Gables
convenience store...

heroically confronting
an armed robber...

with only bottles
of spaghetti sauce.

Yeah?

Ellita Sanchez.

Come in.

What's this?

Susan Waggoner.
Telephone order.

There's an address
in the Gables.

The Gables.

What time is it?

It's 1:00. I was
going out on a date.

I've got a relative
with Southern Bell...

or we wouldn't have gotten
the number for days.

That's great. Thanks.

What are you
going to do?

I'm going to
check it out.

Sanchez...

thanks.

You feeling better?

What would you like
for breakfast?

You're not hungry?

Well, I'm just
gonna run some errands...

and then I'll be back.

I love you.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Hey. Susan, uh...
Waggoner, right?

Remember me?

No, sir.

Hoke "Pork Chops" Moseley.

God, what
happened to you?

Ah, some psycho
jumped me...

almost broke my neck...

stole my gun, my badge,
and my teeth.

Teeth?

Yeah. These are temps.

Hey, I got
something for you.

Do you do your
marketing here?

Excuse me, would you
like to try some sausage?

No, thank you.

Are you sure?
It's really good.

Remember that...

pork chop recipe
I promised you...

with the chestnut batter?

Glad I ran into you.

Oh, this is great.

I can't believe
you remembered.

That is so nice of you.

I'm gonna
put it on my list...

and I'm gonna
make it tonight.

Hey, is that
an invitation?

I'll be there.

Oh.

I got class tonight.
I'm sorry.

You're still
with that guy, huh?

No. Umm...
I kicked him out.

Well, good for you.

You know
who he really is?

He's a murderer.

Herman Gotlieb
isn't even his real name.

He spent his life in prison.

Frederick J. Frenger,
Junior

Junior.

Hate to run into Senior.

Oh...

hey, you ever made
vinegar pie?

Vinegar pie?
My mother used to make it.

I can still taste it.

Oh. Seedless raisins
for a start.

Chop 'em up real fine.

And you beat the egg
yolks and the butter...

until they're creamy...

Wait a second.

And you beat
the egg whites...

until they're stiff...

and then you
fold them in...

and you take
one cup of sugar...

and, um...

here's
the tricky part, OK?

This is the key.

You use 5% vinegar,
no stronger.

And just 3 teaspoons,
that's all.

Just 3 little teaspoons.

That's where Mama
went wrong.

Yeah, probably so.

You don't know
where I could...

find that old boyfriend
of yours, do you?

No. He's gone for good.

I know you wouldn't
lie for him.

He was the liar.

Well, uhh...
enjoy that recipe.

I will.

Look, my number's on it.

If you really like it,
give me a call.

Oh, my God.

One.

Two.

Three.

What are you
doing tomorrow?

I was gonna paint
the security bars.

Oh, no. I got
a million errands...

I gotta run tomorrow.
I wanted to go in...

and cash in
my coin collection.

I need you to drive me
around some.

We'll be done by noon.

Can't you drive?

Oh, no way, honey. Heh!
Honey, I gotta...-

I'm gonna be hoppin'
in and out...

of a hundred different
places.

Cost me a fortune
just to park...

if I could find a place.

That dessert?

I'll bring it to you.
Just go sit down.

So, you gonna drive me
around tomorrow?

Junior, are you sure
this is just an errand?

You promised no more
illegal stuff.

You saved my life, Susie.

Would I fuck up
the best thing...

that ever happened
to me...

just to make you
some kind of a wheelman?

Would you?

We made a deal.

I promised.

Like it?

This is really great.

It's great!

Great.

One of your best.

If a cop should
hassle you...

then you just drive on
around the block.

Why would anyone
hassle me?

You parked
in a yellow zone.

Police officer.

Buzz me in.

You say these coins
are stolen, Sergeant?

Sergeant, uh...

Moseley.

Homicide.

We picked him up
on a fencing sting.

We figure if we could
get a line on the owners...

we could solve the crime.

This a valuable
collection or what?

It's by no means
a rare collection.

When I take
this fleeting breath

When my eyes,
they close in death

Just a cursory look
at these coins...

tells me they're
in fair condition.

That was cursory?

You ever seen them before?

Seen lots like them.

What happened
to your eye?

Car accident.

You should sue the doctor
who sewed you up.

You could make a bundle.

He said it'd be fine
after it scarred over.

He lied.

How come
a homicide detective...

is so interested
in stolen property?

First of all, that's
confidential information.

Second of all, I'll ask all
the questions around here.

I'm working on a tip.

I'm thinking of putting
a stakeout in here.

You know, before
I put that window in...

I was hit 3 times
in one month...

but I don't need
no stakeout now.

Yeah? Why's that?

Because of Pedro. Pedro!!!

He's been watching you
the whole time...

through a peephole
in the door.

It's OK, Pedro.

This is Sergeant Moseley.

He's with the
police department.

You bitch!

Oh, God.

You promised!

What the fuck
are you doing?!

-Freeze! Police!
-Freeze! Police!

Hold it.

Hey, move it!

Stop! Police!

Get out of the car!

Shit.

What happened to you?

Raise your hands level
with your shoulders.

What are you gonna do
if I don't, Sarge?

Shoot me?

What was the bullshit...

with the money
you left me...

Frederick?

I don't give
nothing away.

What did the Krishna
do to die?

Where did you get
that jacket?

Herman Gotlieb.

Stand up.
Back up slowly.

Turn around
and face the wall.

I don't think
I can do that.

I'll pass out.

Most of my fingers
have been cut off...

and I'll probably go into
shock any minute now.

Move it!

Everything's turning
all orange and silver.

Susie's going to
get you, Sarge.

Hello.

Did you kill him?

Good-bye, Junior.

You don't have to answer
if you don't want to...

but, uh...gotta clear
a few things up.

Did you know Junior
was gonna rob the store?

I was hoping he wouldn't.

He swore to me.

I had to give him
the benefit of the doubt...

because he had
some good qualities.

He always ate everything
I ever cooked for him.

And he never hit me.

There were lots of good
things about Junior.

Listen, Hoke, this is
exactly what happened...

or you're in big
jurisdictional trouble.

You were tailing him...
a murder suspect.

You see him coming
out of the coin shop...

with a gun in his hand.

Suspecting him of robbery,
you called for back-up...

and you followed him
to the house.

He pulled a gun on you,
and you shot him.

Something like that.

Exactly like that.

There's only one problem,
though: the girl.

She'll blow holes
in this story.

Cut her loose.

Is she really
Princess Not-So-Bright...

or is she just pretending?

Ah, she's been
through hell.

Leave her alone.

Let's get the fuck
out of here.

You look different.

I got my teeth back.
