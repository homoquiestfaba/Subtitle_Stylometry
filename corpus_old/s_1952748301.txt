I saw a strange dream.

It's Friday, we
are in the hospital

not a hospital though.
It is a forest...

And I know this because,

your side is a bear and
a little over a stream.

And suddenly you begin to give
rise and I can not get into.

But the bear can...

And soon I see that holds the
hands of our beautiful baby boy!

And here is where it
gets really weird dream...

Intersects with the teeth
of the umbilical cord,

and I do not seem
to be annoyed.

This should be a good sign!

The Theodore I liked, but
remember that article I had shown,

saying that we should not give our
children the names of famous people?

I do not want to think that it
failed if not do something...

...Arthur! The Arthur is good.

There is the myth
of the Round Table...

But there's a word game

which is not very flattering
to the name Arthur.

And then we come to Casey.

Where is the list
of names like...

Casey, Dylan Jordan,
Tyler and Skailer...

which are all girls names.

If so the call through Sydney.

I try to leave Atlanta. In
Denver there is more bread

There is an underground
conspiracy government.

So?

There has been much buzz
and discussion forums.

Wait a minute, to answer
my phone. Hi darling.

Hi. -Did you get my message?

I got it and I heard
around the waist.

I went for a break.

Look, I would not like to think that
arbitrarily rejected these names...

You can see them
for yourself...

But it is a great
decision to take.

Yes, I see than you take very
seriously the whole issue.

I have not told me
yet... What direction?

Armani!

I call my wife... no no...
The driver is my baby.

Listen, just arrived at
the airport... I gotta go...

Bye, love you and I
can not wait to meet!

Goodbye, I love you...
have a nice flight!

I hit the car! I
plucked out the door!

Sorry... Tell me
first, he hit anyone?

I have a limo. You have not heard
of the protocol at the airport?

Set... This is serious
damage... That is nothing!

Are you okay? Sorry for my
friend... I think it is drunk.

And you look a bit...
Does pinate together?

You can not say that... we drank
a half a dozen beers we shared.

You know something? My father used
to say... when your day starts so...

then all will be like a
huge uphill afterwards.

This is wrong...

Normally they say that
everything is like a downhill.

But everybody wants to be
over... no one wants to be down.

So say it is an uphill.

Yes, but it's easier
to be a downhill...

So your dad had no idea!

Selby? Are you okay?

A happy man! We
take care of myself!

Excuse me sir, but you
can lift my suitcases?

No, because they say
that you should never,

to grab their luggage
in a foreign airport.

Pick them yourself.

Checking baggage!

In your owns this bag?
-Is there a problem?

Can I look at the fast?
-Yes, yes... course.

What magazine is
this? Very cute.

This is not mine.

But is your bag...

Bingo!

This is definitely not mine!

Not mine this bag...
Mistook her before with...

Pack your own suitcase sir?

Yes, but not this bag.
I never did my drugs.

Maybe carry drugs...

You look like someone
carrying drugs?

I do not know what they
look like they carry drugs...

What to say...
You're the expert?

What do you say?
That's the look like me?

Who said that?

Your eyes! Your eyes say...

My eyes? Eyes say something
that says my mouth?

I do not think
you look like...

You could not stir
things so much... I?

Tempelakos you... eh?

Your behavior
is inappropriate!

I have been told many things
about my behavior... but not so!

My God! Look Sunny! Very
posh. As you are in paradise!

Well are you serious? Not
see that anyone sitting here?

Excuse me.

Hi! What are you doing? What
brings you to the A position?

The ticket is closed!

I was in tourism,

but the seat belt was broken,
and brought him to the A position.

Do not tell me...

I was lucky. Nice to see you!

You know what? I think I
accidentally took the bag before you.

I know.

The bag I was seized, along
with a pipe for marijuana had.

What I had for medical
purposes... I have glaucoma.

Yes convinced us...

Ladies and gentlemen we
are ready for takeoff.

Please turn off all
electronic devices,

if you have laptop, place
it in the cupboard above.

Thank you very
much. Good flight.

Dude? -Yes?

They notice. We
need to hang it.

We need to hang up. -I'll go.

Know why you should hang up?

Because terrorists often
use the time off their mobile

to activate a bomb located
in the luggage down.

Be not say this word? -What
for? Terrorist or bomb?

Just said together the two words
you should never say on board.

I understand but we
must understand that...

Stop talking and just listen.

You should not say words
that make others to scare.

Just trying to...

This is not right...

You and your friend can
get in front of the plane?

My friend?

Excuse me...

Listen.

This Karagiozi I have
not ever seen in my life.

This is not true, we exchanged
our bags at the airport.

This was accidental!

Lord! I'm Federal Agent.

Please come to the
front of the airplane.

What Why?

Let down your
device. -Is my phone.

Throw down the
device eh asshole!

What you gonna do shoot
me in front of everyone?

Do not worry. It hurt.
It is a rubber ball.

I have good news Mr Hyman. They
found your luggage on board.

Good.

Unfortunately, the aircraft
travels over the Kansas now.

But I have your mobile phone.

You can now sign
here. Is your release.

Yes... for you will not sue?

He says he did so according
to the laws of the state.

Yes. Sure.

If you write your address
to send you your luggage.

No. Leave to go to LA Airport,

and will I get when
I get there myself.

When is the next flight?

In no time, but
you can not get it.

Why?

Because you're on the
blacklist of airlines.

Why?

This explains here.
Both you and your friend.

Who?

The gentleman who
just interrogated.

I've never seen this
asshole in my life.

Really? He again had only
good things to say about you.

This is ridiculous!
-No matter...

My wife is pregnant!
Need to go back to LA

This is a big misunderstanding.
What do I do now?

Have you seen the
movie Forrest Gump?

Yes.

He crossed our country
running, and it was stupid!

So I think it
will succeed too.

You are free to leave.

What exactly happens?

Probably the paraleo...
We can handle it.

But unfortunately I
can not fly to come.

What did you do? Beat someone?

No! I was calm and logical...

Sometimes drifting!

How are you coming home?

I plan...

And my plan unfolded slowly
as my wallet travels to LA

What?

Yes, and I try to exhaust
all means available to it...

In looking everywhere!

Stay away from me!
All causes me trouble.

I found something
that belongs to you.

Honey may have found a
solution... I'll call you later.

Peter?

You have my stuff?

'Rpaxa this before
I put handcuffs.

The monkey? Got my wallet?

I saw no wallet?

Where is my bag?

I saw your bag,

but I could not get it because my
hands were full with the monkey...

What car did you?

I did not get the car because I am
not driving, because it is my bag...

Shit...

Yes... Thanks for your doll.

Want to come with us?

No! Well I'm... Not
crazy for the dogs...

I know I did not start well...

But I see that I have
great character when I know.

Yes I'm sure...

I have 90 friends on facebook.

12 of them are outstanding,
but I have 90 friends!

Cover the costs of your

and I will pay back
when we get to Hollywood.

In LA!

What?

It is called Hollywood,
but Los Angeles!

I once again go to Hollywood.

What is your name?

Peter.

I am Ethan Tremblay.

And this little
guy here is Sunny.

It was a great honor to come
with us. Come on! It is fun!

The screwed! Plakitsa
did! Come inside!

Strange is the life, eh?

Do you have siblings? -No.

Got dog? -No.

Let me ask you... What
is your favorite color?

Blue.

What's good... Mine is green!

Do you like hotdogs? -Yes.

I like the sausages
with a crust outside.

One time I ate a huge
sausage at a nudist beach,

and will not do it again.

At what age were you when
you lost your virginity?.

We will not discuss
this with you!

I was 9. -My God!

Very good girl! Good girl...
He had freckles remember.

I have a headache. Not your
fault, but that the press too long.

My wife and I will
get a baby. Friday.

That's why I
bought the monkey.

Seriously?

Yes... We do caesarean...

So you see...

I understand! I would meet
a manager in Holllywood,

and my good luck
canceled our appointment.

Are you an actor?

Yes... And you know... I
would like to took a look at...

Watch out!

Sorry.

Look at this.

Ok, But you having
the eyes to the street.

It's pictures.

Here I look hard, but I have a
gun just for peacekeeping purposes.

Interesting

This one is a
favorite of my father.

He says it shows my real self.

I agree with him.

What are these?

Here I sit in a gang,
construction worker, and...

...and Professor nerd?
-No! I make Malcolm X!

He thinks he is a
man! The chazoulis!

Peter, what a bore in
Atlanta? Job or wellbeing?

Job...

What kind of job?

Architecture.

And how did you and dealt
with the work of architecture?

I went to college.

You have nothing else
to ask why I try to...

Well because it will travel
together for a few days

and was not bad to
know each other better.

Well... Ethan. What brought on
in Atlanta? Business or pleasure?

My dad died. I went to
Atlanta for his funeral.

Oh, my God. Sorry.

It was a very nice
man. So I go and west...

He gave me the motivation
to go on television.

On TV? -Yes.

It is very hard space of
television. Very competitive.

I have a friend who
works in this area...

Do you work for the
serial: Two and a half man?

Because of this serial because
I wanted to become an actress.

Especially because
of the second season.

Listen to the project. We are
located outside of Birmingham.

Because we started late morning
we get out of Louisiana...

after 16 hours we will be
near Phoenix, Arizona...

and then we are
8 hours from LA

It would be nice if we
stop at the Grand Canyon.

I will not go to the Grand
Canyon! And I'll tell you why.

Because you will get
120 miles off course

Too bad. My dad would love
to go to the Grand Canyon.

Why is this?

This is my dad. The ashes.

Why is your father's ashes
in a box of coffee, Ethan?

Since Peter is dead!

I know that.

Oh well, do not watch
each other when speaking?

Just know that we put
the ashes in a urn.

This is tightly closed.

Ethan took the lid when you threw the
coffee and put your father through...

Now it is vacuum sealed box.

This is the most stupid
thing I've heard in my life!

It had to come here.
I'm allergic to waffles.

Come Sunny. Thanks.

We will make a brief
stop in Birmingham.

Basically, our next stop
will be much farther away.

It is 10 minutes away and
stop-pull for a few seconds...

But why stop in
Birmingham, Alabama;

We must not procrastinate.

Why I left my medication
in the treatment plane.

Wait! What I mean your grass?

Peter is a medical marijuana.

No is grass.

Why should you
bring disaster ever?

Not to bring, and is grass!

Just say that we do not want to
stop and buy drugs! Does it matter?

Look... I will not say
this now, but it forced me!

Guess who rented the car? Me!

Guess who has the money? Me!

Guess who has a
pleasant personality? Me!

How about you?

You have nice hair
and chin voluntarily,

but allowed me to tell you...

need to build your character!

So you want to go
to California or not?

Yes I do. -Great! Keep Dad!

I got him.

Opening hours are like
traveling with a toddler!

Did you go the toilet?

Well to tell!
Tsisakia'm going to do!

Peter?

You will not believe
this, but I'm on the road!

How is it possible? -He
left me to talk to her.

With a guy... please stop...

With a guy I met in
the office rental cab.

I drive 2000 miles with
a guy who just met me?

Say hello to...

Sarah? I'm Ethan Trimble, and travel
with Peter. What are you doing?

Well I am, you?,

Well well... Just wanted to
inform you that I pack your

to be in perfect condition, and
how will I deliver as Thursday.

Thank you.

Sarah would like to ask you one more
thing. Do you know any good hairdresser

because I do perm and I would
like to soulouposo just my hair.

Sorry, you said
that you do perms?

Yes, perm, I do
my hair curly...

It sucks!

Can I talk to my husband?

Yes of course. Wait.

He wants to talk
to you. -I know.

You know what I have to do?

Oh my God...

Yes like you say...

Do not worry. -Do not worry.

It is a legal practitioner.
I found on the internet.

Who is it?

Fantastic...

Hi, I'm Ethan,
I phoned earlier.

Ends in two minutes to go.

Hello.

You came very quickly.

Yes we were close. I am
Ethan from here Peter.

Are you a cop?

Why not licensed pharmacist?

Just look a caretaker.

And so you know
you're a cop and ask

You have to admit it.

This in fact is a myth.
But I'm not anyway.

It is an architect.

I am an architect when...

Wait a minute... It is a myth?
You kidding me? I did not know it.

You're too scary.

Come on in Ethan. The
pharmacy is in the kitchen.

Peter, you can watch my
kids as we... You know...

Hurry up. -Yes.

Who are you?

I'm Peter.

I'm Alex, and here Patrick.

Good. Alex? Your mother
gave you boyish name.

What do you mean?

The Alex is boyish name...

As you know your
mom have screwed up.

Sorry, my hand slipped.

Once I got it. It's a mixture
that comes from Afghanistan.

Not crazy about mixing. I feel
they lose something in the taste.

Go crazy with this variety.

She has perfect body,
and smells like a dream!

This is Barry. I rent a room.

Hey Barry, what are
you doing? I'm Ethan.

Let me tell you... In the
room I see something on TV.

It is open. You just have
to press the menu button.

Nice perm has a bar.
You did a great job.

Thank you very much, but it
is not perm it is natural.

Nobody do perms anymore. Do
not tell me that you've done?

Yes I did.

My God. Kidding.

Who did?

Just Kidding. There is perm.

Excuse me?

It is not perm it.
I was joking before.

Deceive them both.

It was. Very funny!

From where are you?

From LA

There you go now?

Could you take with you?

No, but there is a body called
the Protection of Children...

What is it? -This is a tie?

You have never seen
in your life tie?

Why did you wear? -Why do so.

Shows stupid.

It is not, and
under your hands!

Stop to do this.

Please stop.

I do not. The blame Reggie.

Then maybe it would be
better to get Reggie a nap.

Stop! No kidding!

Well are you buddy?

What?

Nothing!

So bravo...

Now come to me and say,

Don Corleone
awarded me justice...

...but you do not have the
decency to call me Godfather...

and come to my house the day of
the marriage of my daughter...

and ask me to kill
someone for a fee...

But this is not justice!

That was incredible!
I shudder.

Especially in the second paragraph
you say that the murder...

You are very good Ethan.

I worked very much hand movement
to accomplish this result.

You wrote the text?

No. One of the mafia wrote.

I was glad to meet you...

Do as if nothing was wrong.
Otherwise I will hit you again!

Ready? -Yes! Let's go!

How was it? Your
well-behaved?

More or less yes.

Good. They are good guys.

We're okay?

See you. Good luck
with your acting career!

...The first thing to
do with any actor...

preparing for the
role, is to read the...

scene many times before
pretend. To read the full...

material, if possible throughout
the script. And then...

Hey. Hollywood.

What did you say?

Your card is not valid.

Oh, my God. -Never mind...

You know what? Have to pass the
threshold when I rented this car.

Never mind... We will
pay cash. How are you?

About $ 60.

You are left only $ 60?

Yes.

How much spend on
marijuana? In your medicine?

I'm not sure. About $ 200.

$ 200?. And left only 60
for petrol food and housing?

It is the only dealer in the
area. It has its own prices.

What was going through
your mind when you wasted...

almost all our money on drugs.

I do not think I would
have trouble following.

What were you thinking?

Peter I am not an
accountant nor a Jew.

Are you an adult?

Obviously I'm an adult.
I am 23 years old.

You're the most irresponsible
23 year old I've ever met.

How do you live so long?

How and did not throw yourself
in front of a car so far?

I did that.

How to survive?
Here is my question.

I guess I was lucky.

Yes... The imagined.
Get off the waist.

For God's sake Peter.
-The paint we have Ethan.

Why do you say that?

Why spend all our
money on marijuana.

A small barrier is...

You know what? Would
call the woman...

send me my money.
That will do.

I can not send you because
you have no identity.

You're right. We will
send to you. You see...?

So an adult solves a problem.

I said I was lucky.

Get in the car.

In a leptaki. I want to
get an ad for my album.

How do you write your name?

T-r-e-m-p-l-e-j.

Ready. $ 500 to Ethan Tremblay.

I just want to
see an identity.

Here you are.

You told me that you say Tremblay.
Here he writes Ethan Chase.

He is right...

What do you mean?

Ethan Tremblay is
my artistic name.

I am an actress.
-The art you?

What is your real name?

Ethan Chase. But it
sounds very artistic.

The Ethan Chase
sounds very artistic.

The Tremblay is miserable.
In a confusing,

it appears that
someone invented.

Yes, I invented it.

Ethan know that you invented.
It's your artistic name.

Why did you give my wife to
send money to your artistic name?

I did not think. Trying
to connect to my new name.

Guys, want to talk it out.

Got something else on you
to write your real name?

Yes yes. I have my mind?

It has two names...

Fantastic.

What the hell is this?

It...

It's identity.

Is photo ID.

I can not accept.

Why?

Why is a photo of yourself.

Anyone can make one and
write on it the name it wants.

Yes, but why get into all
this trouble for $ 500 only?

I do not know why. But I know
that it is likely that he did.

So now we have to call
my wife to mother to go...

back to the bank and send
money to send the correct name.

Exactly.

Only you have to do tomorrow,
they will finish in 5 minutes.

It is still 6.35, sir.

You're going to play my boss?
With checks what time I leave?

I say close to 5 minutes.

I booked the Tsilis
to be with my friends.

Have you booked?

If you think about it,
very smart thing to do.

What? I think if you
look at me so I fear?

Why not do your job eh Vlahos?

Do dreams palioaderfara.

Wait a minute.
Excuse me. Peter.

I apologize for my friend,
but we need the money...

go to Avenue A is present at
the birth of his firstborn child.

What a sweet story. You know who
I was when my daughter was born?

In Tsilis?

In Iraq. Call the
sergeant to tell me and...

dakryvrechti to your story?
will certainly upset...

Now in closing?
Will not be late too?

It is sarcastic,
Ethan. And shows us...

To understand that
is tough veteran.

Rather it is and half after
a bombing that took place...

How dare you?

Well you did.

Not going well...

Now you did for the good.

The fucked her?
I fucked her on?

Spit on your window.

Let go? -Yes.

Hey, buddy.

What you said to me just now?

Sorry I did not know...

Did not you know that I am
paralyzed? -That you are paralyzed.

But how can you know?

Indeed, how to know?
Sorry... You know?

That's my fault. I
had a very bad day.

The day you were ugly?

Just going to
deteriorate even further.

Better to hide it.

This must hurt.

Did I have good moves?

I'll fuck her for good.

This move I call cart

Wait a minute.

Where are you going?

He called the police.

Fuck the police. Look.
Here comes the train.

It's time to finish... Tsilis
to go to and find my friends...

Are you okay my friend?

Do not call me
that... A friend helps

his friend when the attack.

Peter man was paralyzed.

Please call me or Mr Peter Hyman,
and I'll call you Mr. Chase.

Unless, and this
identity card is fake.

Let's leave it better...
Neither actor you're not normal.

What does this mean?
What is a regular actor?

A true actor can
pretend a role.

Set... Give you a
scene to play... Hello.

No. I do not want...

Should...

Ok, I'm Julia Roberts

we're engaged and
you have cancer.

Notify me of what
happens to you.

Julia Roberts, as you know...

we are engaged...
I have cancer.

Terrible.

What?

Sorry, but this
is my criticism.

I thought it went very well.

No. I'll give you
another chance.

It's Sunday, a league, and
you're a career coach...

The group you are losing a lot
of points, storm the locker room,

and the way you dismiss the
world. It's all or nothing. Go.

I will not never
shot such a film.

Yet such a film is shot every
two years... Every two years.

Ok kids... We must go
out there and try too.

Pol. You do like chick out
there. Are you really f chick?

Jackson... Concentrate. Do
you sometimes bitch and you?

Let the little sabotage.

Your wife calling
and asks you to break.

The wife of a coach?

Yes, calling and
called divorce.

Drina Drina.

Yes?

Children will take a while,
got my wife. He wants a divorce.

Love me... What
did you say? Not...

This is not a good time...

Once I lost my father. Do
not leave me and you now.

I do not want to be alone.
I miss you very much.

I can not do that.

I got coke, and water...

All right. Thanks.

What is rain. -Do
not say anything...

I drove enough for
today. I sleep in the car.

And tomorrow we...

Tell me about your
father. What job did he do?

Was the official
toll. -Seriously?

He had to do then with
people. He loved his job.

Every night he returned home,

and laughed at how long
was the tail of the chamber,

because he liked to talk
to anyone passing by.

You, your dad? Where is it?

I have no idea.

When you saw him last time?

1977.

Yes... I remember, came
to my room and said,

Peter I have a very
important job for you.

I want you to wake up
tomorrow morning at 5.30.

And I enjoyed so much,
why do not I ever asked...

do nothing. I did not
know if there even for him.

I was so happy.
I put the alarm

and almost did not sleep all night,
because then I looked at the time.

It's time I went in
his room, wake him up...

and I... smiled
for the first time.

But I saw that he packs his
bags were on the front door.

The got put in
the car and left...

It was the last
time I saw him.

It's so funny.

My dad would I ever
did that. With Lover.

What is that noise?

What noise?

He stopped now.

Please. Resumed.

Oh, that's me. Masturbate.

What Why?

To catch a sleep.

Stop it please...
I'm just beside you.

Close your eyes, Peter.

Is closed, but the noise...

Do a little patience.

How long does it take you?

I do not know for now, but it
usually takes me 35 minutes.

So only?

Until your dog does.

Sunny. Stop.

Sunny, no. Stop it. Happy dog.

Come here. Aschimomoutro.

Try not to think
about. I had to do.

Please... It was
unbearable. Unbearable.

Shit. Damn.

Ok... Gathered here before
the Lord to kidepsoume...

someone who does not
even remember his name.

In Chase, or some Tremblay.

Let rest in peace. Amen.

I would like to
tell you sir, how...

were you on the
edge of that highway.

You do not fault
anything. But your son...

is very difficult man
to traveling with him.

In fact I can not
understand why...

not the throttle while
he was a baby yet.

Net. Have you
forgotten something?

No. I went to get
coffee and donuts.

I thought you left me.

Not just went to get
breakfast to eat...

the road to save time.

And why did you let
the things I here?

Why is your property.

What you say makes sense.

Want to ride me?
-Yes. It's your turn.

Very good.

I'll put the thing behind you.

Come Sunny.

And I thought that there was
no way to let Peter here...

I know we had our disagreements,
but they will never leave me.

Of course not. Nor is my car.

Right.

Get in Sunny.

You know spent
a lot of my mind.

Why do you want
to travel alone?

Did you shower?

Yes.

You know, these places have very
good facilities with showers.

This coffee is hot.

Yes. It is hot coffee.

We passed the
Mississippi River?

We are in Texas...
The Mississippi was...

river that we had when
we were in Mississippi.

Too bad. It was a good
place to rest my father.

To throw the ashes in the
river... and to get to New Orleans.

I sleep a bit, okay?

My father loved jazz music,

and women's breasts.

Snoring last night?

Yes.

Sorry, I sleep deeply.
It is a condition...

You have heard that saying, he either
did not wake up with an earthquake?

Happened to me once again to be
an earthquake and not wake up.

Also once slept at the time...

I took an interview for a job.

I did not sleep at all last
night. I'll try to sleep now.

Then I had to masturbate,
because I and I...

a tremendous orgasm,
and slept like a baby.

Get up.

Ethan. Wake up.

Damn.

I do not feel my legs. My God.

What happened?

Please take a look
at the contract...

How well, covered
by insurance.

Stay away from
me. -Are you okay?

I'm okay? You look good?

I have a broken hand

Three cracked ribs and
7 stitches in my arm.

I made this for an
answer? No, I'm not well.

Peter, I am very sorry.
-This tells me nothing.

I ended ruin you, nor scratch.

Yes, but doctors
said that due to...

that was cool because
I slept deeply.

I told you sleep deeply...

Yes, tell me... But I
told you that doctors...

that there is a catch
to sleep at the wheel?

I tried to rest
my eyes for me.

But the next time and
you, being more relaxed.

Who is he?

This is a true friend, came
to pick me up from Dallas.

Well, you sit in front.

No, no. It came to get
U.S., but with company.

Incidentally, I
was very pleased.

And I have my own
conscience, allow me...

tell you why I
will not get us.

It is because of you because
I was kicked out of...

the plane and shot a cop...

It is because
as passive and...

I looked as a break in
the wood a paralyzed...

And it is because
nearly kill me,

the most important
week of my life...

I leave here, for a much
more important reason.

I hate what you
with all my soul.

I've heard it,
and try to fix it.

Good. Now listen, too.
Do not go to Hollywood.

The streets are made of gold,

but from the corpses as
stupid as you think...

to go there and
catch the good...

Try to avoid it.

That said Shakespeare.
Have you heard?

Yes I have heard. He
was a famous pirate.

Which incidentally
named Saixpirogeni.

'To give you a
friendly advice...

Nobody calls it that Hollywood
did not make it there.

This is news to me.

Sunny... Sure I will miss
you, old aschimomouriko shit.

In my 23 years never...

Let's go apo'do...
-What the hell?

Thank you very
much for coming.

It does nothing...
Who is he yelling?

None. Never a concern.
-Are you sure...

It is pure trouble.
-Shows very sad.

And spat and his dog.

The spat it out... I did
this because it irritated...

I'm good. Let's go. -What?
Will leave him there?

Trust me... I know what I do.

Peter, I know how many years?

20 years.

20 years... and believe me,
you do not want to play...

the karma when you
wait and child...

Do what it takes to solve the
misunderstanding that got him.

Trust me.

Hollywood, come here.

You see what I can do?

Relax a little.

Are you ready to apologize?

What? 'De fuck. Let go.

Pete. Relax.

First of all I regret
that I spat the Sunny.

I did not understand
how to channel it.

If you come with me to LA
needs to put some rules.

1st, if I make
even a question,

will skylovriso, so
do not do that. Got it?

Yes

2nd, if you catch a
sleep for some reason

unless of course it is
night and you're in a bed

I will eviscerate. Got it?

Yes...

3rd, if you are allergic to
waffles, then do not eat waffles!

Then, do not you go and a
restaurant that makes waffles!

Shut up! -Calm...

Take the things you,
Mr climb in the back!

Keep the Sunny.

No! So grasp my hands
the dog would tear in two!

Make sure to go to a doctor
did it before worse...

...and due to the excluded
and the two fly from LA to

Are you serious? -Yes!
and then worsened...

I think he has a problem!
It went soft in front of me?

What? Kidding me? -No,
really I say, he did!

This ditch is in front of us?

Yes!

Would you...? -Absolutely!

Sanidose it!

Ethan you are well?

Yes, what happened?

The next time you're
more relaxed...

He and the other way!
-Seriously? Come again.

We can get your car...

No problem... Anyway
I will have my truck.

It will bring back the post...

There is no reason...
I'll be in LA Friday.

What would you do
in LA on Friday?

We will not lose anything with
the birth of your baby man...

Too bad it does
cesarean Sarah.

It was so perfect
body. Flawless!

Who do you know
that we do caesarean?

He said the same! Want coffee?

Yes!

What happens?
-What do you mean?

How has so many stories
to tell about your wife?

It was the old couple in college?
-Yes, but that was 20 years ago.

Yes, but do not you see?

This guy is like podos-fairistis,
handsome, charming...

They do not understand.

He has beautiful hands!
You see his hands?

I think that something
is going on here...

Darryl, we took this photo?

What?

The photograph of Sarah.

When you remove it in
February. Not that we were told?

Yes... He said that at
a meeting but did not...

...yes we were and started
to drink and methame...

...like the good old
days... Got a good woman...

In February...

That is, before 9 months?

There I told you
not to ask questions?

About 9 months...

Finally came to a name? Told
me you're just pushing it.

She told you that? -Yes,
we talked via email.

You and the wife
You exchange email;

You exchange What else?

Ethan...

Body fluids?

What say?

I do not think...
-No... no...

Did you ejaculate? -What?

This happens when the
urine you are white.

Ok, I have a new rule...
Not allowed to say a word!

This coffee is terrible.
It has taste like cat feces.

I think it is very delicious.

And you should!

Ended my own coffee,
used by your own.

This was not the
coffee! It was the

ashes of the dead
father who had put in!

Throw him out! In mousato
and his dog... Throw them out!

I understood...

Take out.

My God! I'm so stupid!

Where are the ashes?

Calm down.

Where are the
ashes of my father?

Where?

They are there to show you.
Look there in the coffee maker.

Set the box, coffee maker...
Sit down to empty and it...

Chill...

You can relax?

Never mind...
I'll gather myself.

Sorry your father drank.

Never mind...

Are you okay, surely?

Yes, it's pretty crowded box.

The Darryl had
three cups of coffee

thus should have left about
8 cups of my father here.

Well...

Fortunately he had good taste.

There was also bad...
Could full flavor...

He liked the coffee...

...and turned out
to be coffee...

Circles that makes
life... -Do not discuss...

Restore your right
to ask questions.

Yes?

Start it!

How is your arm?
-Not too bad...

Do you think that Darryl
slept with your wife?

No.

I think so.

Then why would you lend this
beautiful car and so much money...

Why is my friend. So!

Have you ever been
to a zoo in San Diego?

I also have a
question for you...

How I came to do
the last 3 questions?

I thought your
wife and Darryl,

and that may have
left the pregnant...

If so would like
their child as zebra...

Then I thought that I have
ever seen in my life... zebra

and that it might be a
good idea to go to the zoo

San Diego when we
come to California.

No! I've never
been to the zoo.

Next question please.

Honey, are you a
faithful husband.

I call the West Texas...

Did the other line
talking with Darryl?

Or rather...

Tell me more
about the wonderful

tokyriako Savva, who
spent in San Diego...

It must be very well spent...

So now all the email
go to mend things...

If there is something you want
to tell me before it's too late

and find myself surprised
at the room of confinement

would greatly appreciate
it if you erased all...

Call me!

I was right or
wrong? -For what?

For Darryl, your wife and
the mysterious baby...?

Asleep and left a message...

Fret when you
mention this issue,

and would greatly
appreciate it if you did...

I bought something to snack
on foods... -Yes I saw it.

I want to drive
because I can not...

I took vicodin and does not
make drivers under the influence.

But so hang on just your
eyes or make it sleep,

I will strangle
you with your scarf.

I wrap the scarf around
your neck and strangle you.

I promise.

It is not too extreme?
-Take off your glasses.

Once I bought! I want
to wear it for awhile.

It's night and a driver.

You do not like you ever
crash into your life!

Take off! -Well!

Soda is this?

Drink up!

You're not my boss!

Drink up!

Well done... nice guy!

Incidentally, only
once slept at the wheel!

I'm a big guy, I'm an adult!

I remembered to go to the
bathroom before we leave?

These are nice.

The windows do not work!

Block them to stay in
the air to mastouroso...

I mastourosei too?

Do you feel stoned?

And then what happened?
How to find a solution?

It turned out that the cheese
grater was under the mattress.

It's so refined and
so full of meaning...

Yes... It is very meaningful.

How do you know this
for the serial...

I manage an unofficial site for
the series made the last 6 years.

It all started from an internet
cafe I went to wash my feet.

What is the name of the site;

It srainingtwoandahalfmen.com

This is exquisite.

I want to revoke the honorary
sub-reviews I did for you.

I thank you very much Peter.

Give me a prawn.

Yes.

Thank you.

Give one and Sunny.

We continue to be a freeway?

Peter Relax, and let me!

Are you sure?

You become paranoid. In
affected more grass...

Just see a sign that
says Mexico border.

Oh my God...

What?

I thought that it wrote Texaco!
I wanted to stop for petrol!

Do not worry, no
problem. We're fine.

What would you do?
What would you say?

I'll go there and tell
them that we made a mistake

and would ask that we
reverse and go back.

Perfect.

I can not talk,
sit straight...

We will not be suspect if you
ask something and not respond?

'At all on me...

Leave them all over you...

The policeman looks.

Peter please, hush.

Hello. Something
strange happened... go...

Are you a U.S.
citizen? -Yes we are.

Both of you? -Yes, of course!

Can I see your passports? -We
do not have passports on us.

Something strange happened...
did not want to rthoume here...

We got to a wrong
turn at some point...

I can do a reversal
and go back to the U.S.?

Want to Flip?

Yes, as I said, I made a
mistake... We try to go...

What is your friend?

Peter stop...

Why shine your
eyes? You did drugs?

No. I have glaucoma.

And your friend is glaucoma?

You have glaucoma?

No, not glaucoma.

And the dog? This also
has, why his eyes shine.

Turn off the car
and give me the keys.

Wait here.

We have a problem? -No.
Everything will be okay.

Give me please the Sunny.

If you ask me
something, I'll wet!

Can you give me and the box
with the ashes of my father?

What are you doing?

I said I took a wrong exit
and ended up here accidentally.

Many times to ask me,
this will tell you.

Reminds me of Jason Vourne.

You know you go...
You have no identity...

I would like to talk to
the American consulate.

I am American
and I have rights.

Immediately. -Thanks...

Pedro wants to speak
with the consulate.

Hello! Here,
American Consulate,

What can I do for you?

This is unacceptable.

Why laugh? The issue is
serious. I have rights.

You Americans come
illegally in our country

buying drugs and having
fun with our women.

I have never heard of American
entering illegally into Mexico.

Usually the opposite.

I'm tired of
listening to bullshit.

Attempted to pass drugs
across international borders.

Things are very serious.

Ok... Sunny Sit there.

Shit!

Stop!

Help!

Step aside.

What the hell?

Take your car to the edge!

I do not speak English!

Sunny Hang! It
difficult things!

Ethan?

Wait!

Oh my God! Peter!

Peter are you okay?

With what speed you go?

I'm not sure... In
60 miles I guess.

I had no idea I was
going... And then I see you.

But again did not
look very familiar...

I know... In
recognition of his eyes?

It looked totally insane!

I know! So I put the
scarf on and my hair...

You were like a commando!
As an Indian warrior!

Thanks.

This will be your
new photography.

I fit perfectly!

It hurts too much!

I then give them to me? -Yes

Take it easy. Do not overdo.

Rescue! A daring rescue!

Came back to me! -Yes I did!

That was perfect!

Yes... After I
told! In promised.

I told you that I will
return home safe and I will.

I'll kiss you. -What?

I'll give you a kiss. -No...

Without saying
anything... Stop Peter.

Aidiaaa!

You have many variations
at your disposal.

I owe you buddy.

There was no way to have seen
my child if you do not save.

I love you man...

And I love you Peter.

My God...

Honey, I ask forgiveness.

You know when I get jealous.

But I told you that
I had met down there.

I know. It has nothing to
do with you. But with me.

'KÃ¶se me. Do not say anything,
just listened for awhile.

There will never betray
Peter. You know that.

We are a family.

Nothing else
matters. The right?

You're right.

Come back home please.

I love you baby.
-And I love you.

Ethan wake up.

I wanted to rectify.

I was sure that
the people dug that.

No! It is very old,
and became over time.

So is the Grand Canyon. Sure.

Peter I have photographic
memory, and I remember that...

Ethan, please be outdated.
Is the Grand Canyon.

It is the Hoover Dam...

I know that the Hoover
Dam built by the pilgrims.

And here you are wrong.

It is a magnificent time.

There was no need to stop.

Never mind. It is a
perfect place anyway...

Better to go... Can I
do this one another time.

We have a long time. We anticipate
to get to LA in the morning.

Relax.

I think we should
follow the plan...

I thought it was
part of the plan...

What I do not understand?

Ethan, what happens?

Because when I said that it will
stop at the Grand Canyon, you said,

Too bad it would be perfect...

And when I said that we had
already passed in Mississippi, said

Too bad, my dad loved jazz
music and the female breasts.

We have many things to do,
and do not want to delay.

I know it's hard
to say goodbye...

I did not know your father,
but from what I said,

must have been very good man.

Just say you and I suggest...

If you have the power to do
this great act... He deserves it.

Come here Sunny.

Dad, I stood like a father.

And I do not know how
to handle it without you.

But I know I'll
watch from up there.

Dad will make you proud.

I promise.

I love you. Hello to my mom.

Goodbye Dad.

It was fishy man. I
adored him. It was like me.

I would like to tell you something
that I did feel very bad about it.

I have weight on my chest.

In walked the attitude
we had in Louisiana.

What?

I did not intend to
go... It was my mistake.

Why did you do that?

Why am I a pig and an
asshole, but I try to fix it.

You know something? But
returned with donuts.

That says a lot more about you
than the fact that he left us.

You're something
else! Thank you.

He left a weight off me.

Is there anything I
can draw from me too.

Tell me.

I'm not actually 23 years old.

I know. Never mind.

And the other is...

Peter, I have your wallet, and
then I had from the beginning.

What? What do you mean?

Peter listen.

Why did you do that?

I saw the plane, and did
not want to be myself.

I was very sensitive because
of the death of my father.

I did not want to
cross the country alone.

Is all here. -Yes.

All the money
and all my cards.

Everything I
needed those days.

Are you okay? -Go
past... What to do?

All right. Thank you
Peter. Let's start then.

Get you in Sunny, and lead me.

I'll kill you.

Peter!

Ringing your phone.

Hello, darling.
-Peter came hours.

What? -You will not
believe it, my water broke.

How? -Who are you?

At the Grand Canyon, come.
-What? Told the Grand Canyon?

Mom, is in the
Grand Canyon. -Oh...

Who was it? -My
wife gives birth.

I thought I would do a
caesarean! -Get in the car.

I speak as if...
Well well... Let's go.

You will not succeed.

Perfect, will miss
the birth of my child.

I manage to get! -Do not say
we get, we're not together.

First, in the future...
-No, I am first.

Can I speak? -No you can not.

I told you I will break out...

I admit that I have a problem,
and I regret that I broke on you.

But I warned you.

Sorry. -Okay.

But in the future, if you go
out as friends and quarrel...

Do not hit in the face, do
you know what I make my bread.

Even bleed. -Look in the
glove box for pharmacy.

Clean up a little yourself.

What is that thing?

He threw...

I can not believe I did
that! Sorry Peter. Sorry.

I did not know that it is full.
I am ashamed so much. Stop.

No. I will continue, not
stop. -Peter step aside.

Why? -I am in shock!

Do not panic!

Oh no... -Yes.

Here it is. -I am very sorry.

Do not worry, we must
stop the bleeding.

Come a little,
you get the scarf.

To get back? -What the hell
are you? Come I told you!

Come, do not move.

Okay, I have. I want to
tie, I have only one hand...

Peter, I have to go to hospital.
-No hospital will get well.

My God, what have
I done! -Stop.

Listen a bit!

Let's do an exercise in
acting as we do in the toilet.

You're a sergeant and a
soldier I got my promised...

that you will come
back soo to my beloved.

Perfect.

Peter vomit...
-It's OK buddy...

But to drive.

Soldier! Sit in the back seat!

Do you like
gkomenoula! -Perfect!

Do you like? -Yes, go.

Finally decided?
-How to decide?

Your son will be born,
how would you name him?

I know just to see him. -What
do you think about Sunny?

We will not give my child
a name my dog masturbates!

Do not listen to
Sunny. Depths loves you!

Sunny, no!

Sunny... Sorry!

Return home!

I did it!

The monkey!

Sunny, we return immediately.

I got it.

I have a future
father! Where do we go?

Shit! I forgot to leave the
window open to get air by Sunny.

The car has no door, Ethan!

See? When working,
it gets us nothing!

Okay, go here.

Let soulouposoume
a bit. -Good.

Sit draw the eye.

Wear the vest to
hide the blood...

I told you how much
I like your perm?

Thanks Peter!
Look who came back?

Sarah!

Come here. Hello ma'am.

Hide handcuffs! Put the
handcuffs in your pocket!

Take the monkey.

Keep pushing.

Sarah? -Peter?

I hear? -Go!

Peter! -Sarah?

Darryl? What the hell?

Who is he?

I do not know! We must go out!

Peter!

From here.

Baby, you came.

Jeez, Peter, are you okay?

Yes, you just
lost some blood...

Calm down everyone please!
We need to find a hospital.

Who are you?

My name is Ethan Tremblay and I'm
the best friend of your husband.

Nice to meet you.

Also! Now! Let's pull
this baby from your vagina!

All right.

Get away!

Look at the babies!
Look at this baby!

Look at your baby!

Show me, show me!

It's very cute!

It's very nice boy!

It girl.

No.

Yes. Dr. Greene
says it has happened.

The ultrasounds are
not 100% reliable.

Our little Rosie!

Rosie?

Rosie Hyman... Do
not you hear strange?

No. It's a beautiful name!

Sarah said that you liked you.

When you talked to Sarah?

We talked after I cut
the umbilical cord.

You cut him?

The living link between
mother and child.

I cut him.

No.

Yes.

You?

I kept a little and
put it in my wallet.

It's good if you
hurt your ankles.

My God!

Ethan, I had dreamed it!

It's crazy...

I saw a strange dream about the
current day, where there was a bear...

What?

And the bear was cut with the
teeth of the umbilical cord.

If you think the
dream came true...

You understand what I mean?
-I do not got it... What.?

Forget it... Must
be a good sign.

Better to leave you
with your family.

I go to meet an agent.

Oh, yes! It's Friday.

I wanted to give you that. Do
you have any information for me.

If you ever need
someone to babysitting...

You will have an opportunity.

The last days were
completely crazy!

Yes, crazy!

We must do it again.
Xanadiaschisoume To America.

Okay...

Call me tomorrow to say.

If I can not...

Call me tomorrow to say.

Can I send email. Do
not get it wrong...

No, no! A playground
is the email.

Say hi, Sunny.

Would you mind if me and
Sunny were taking the van?

No, free.

I was very happy Peter.

...And not only...

Thanks.

Ethan? Welcome to Hollywood.

What? You want to
come back to talk?

No, just a welcome
from the city!

Make sure you
call me tomorrow.

I'll call you.

I come!

Please?

Hello, I'm Stu professor.

Are you Jake?

No, I'm the father.

A... Stu I am a teacher.

Indeed... Do you smoke grass?

No Sir! You smell of my cat.

Your cat?

Yes...

You're right.
It is very funny!

Do not go mad. I told you
that the series made it funny.

Come after the worship!

Survived the hands
of... a big difference.

Charlie, here the
professor Jake, Stu.

I'm not stoned man...
My cat is to blame.

Stu Relax, we're
not policemen.

As the clock.

I told him to call after
seeing the whole episode.

It revolutionized!

If you tell our daughter
the name, you freak!

...Again no thanks.

Do you have a
little more grass?

If you pay me $ 9
an hour, I have not!

E... I wanted to say that I have
no idea what you talking about!
