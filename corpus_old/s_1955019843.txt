Hey! Freak-boy.
Have a nice trip!

See you next fall!

Leave him alone,
jerk-off.

Oh, or what?

You gonna kick my ass
with some ballet moves?

Hey, get a life!
Moron.

Don't listen
to them, okay, Bart?

Hey, melodie and i
are gonna go for a hike.

I'll be home in a bit.
Don't tell mom and dad, okay?

See you at home, buddy.

Hey, Emma.

Hi, Dr. sheffield.
Here's your mail.

Thank you.

Hey. Dad.

Hey, kiddo.

This kid
on the bus--

why don't you give us a second,
go inside and get a snack?

Thanks, buddy.

"Hello"
to you, too, Bart!

You sure Cathy
hasn't seen these?

No, sir.

I've kept it from her
like you asked.

Miss Cathy,
is it my turn?

Yes.

Why's she here again?

Bart, sweetie.

Her mom's in the hospital.

The cancer's come back
so she needs us right now.

Can't she stay
with someone else?

No.

Because there is no one else.

Don't eat too many cookies.

You'll spoil your appetite.

Okay, sweetie.

Show me what you did.

Stupid jocks.

See you tonight.

Emma tells me you've already

sold all the tickets
for your show.

Yes, I have.

I really think it's gonna
boost enrolment in the studio.

You've already got
a waiting list!

Well, I think that's
because all the girls

are lining up
to dance with

my very handsome
assistant instructor.

Hey, peanut.
Your babysitter's outside.

-Okay.
-Go.

-Say "bye" to miss Cathy.
Bye, sweetie.

Bye, miss Cathy.
See you tomorrow.

She's so cute.

Yes, she is.

Hey, jory.

Where's your brother?

Oh, he's out
in the treehouse, I'm sure.

Come on.

He's always
in that treehouse.

He's 12.

Do you remember what
you were doing at that age?

I think
I've totally forgotten.

-Really?
-Yeah.

Maybe I need a reminder.

Maybe I can help
with that.

Yeah?

Hey, Bart?

Hey, you up there?

Where are you?

Come on. Clover, where is he?

Good boy.

Come on, clover.

Bart?

Got ya!

You scared
the crap out of me!

Hey, I found
your girlie magazines.

That's not mine.

Yeah?

Relax! I'm not gonna
tell mom and dad.

Where'd you
get it, though?

In the basement of
the Dracula house next door.

Come and see.

Come on, clover.

Come on.

This place
is really creepy.

I wonder if people died here,
and it's haunted.

Maybe that's why
no one's bought it.

Hey, where are you taking me?

Oh, man. That's gross.

I know.
How do you think they died?

Don't know.

Maybe they came in
through the chimney

and got trapped.

No! Clover! Bad dog!

You okay?

Yeah. Man...

Get out of here!

Go home, you stupid mutt!

Hey, hey.

Looks pretty nasty.

As soon we get home,

you've got to
let dad clean it.

No! Don't tell mom or dad.

They'll wonder where I got it.

Come on.
Let's get out of here.

What are you boys
doing in here?

This is private property.

Do you know what happens
to trespassers?

Nobody lives here.

They do now.

It's been bought.

I suggest you leave
right now.

Yeah. Come on, Bart.
Let's go.

I just have to review
for my midterm next week,

and I'm set.

Good man.

What about you, Bart?

How'd you do on
that geometry test?

Fine.

Oh, come on.
You know we have

a "no secrets" policy
in this family.

I got a "c."

Oh, Bart...

Now, now,
that's okay.

I got some "c"s
in my day.

You can work
through that.

You just have to study
more. Right, jory?

You know what I think
would really help me work hard?

Is if I had a pet python
to help keep me company

while I study.

Again, no.

Nice try, though.

Honey, no, I'm not having
those things in my house.

Don't they eat mice and rats?

Oh, by the way, I heard that
someone's moving in next door.

-They are?
-Mm-hmm.

It's about time.

I hope they fix that place up.

As it is, it's really hurting
our property values.

I'm sure they will.

Boys, if you're finished,

why don't you help Emma
with the dishes?

Yeah. Yeah.

Thanks, honey.

They're good kids.

We're blessed,
aren't we?

We are.

Thank you, gentlemen.

That was good.

What's bothering you?

It's just thinking about
little Cindy.

How is Melissa doing?

Not well.

The cancer's metastasized.

What happens when
her mother dies, Chris?

There would be
background checks,

interviews,
people looking into our past.

There are ways
around that.

Melissa wants it, too.

She's offered to have custody
transferred in her will.

Cathy, it's too risky.

Plus, we already have
so many expenses.

The house, the car,
the kids, Emma.

Please, Chris.

That little girl is all alone.
She has no one.

Melodie, you're shivering.

No, we can't.

Your parents' room
is right there.

Come on. This way.
We're going to the attic.

-Jory!
-What?

They're here.

She looks like
a witch.

She must be rich,
though. Look.

That guy's her Butler.

Let's get closer.

Bart!

Where are
my scrapbooks?

I can't see anything.

Yeah, but I can
hear people.

I'll unpack
them tomorrow.

Come on. Let's get outta here.
This place is creepy.

It's okay,
they won't see us.

-You don't think so?
-No.

We weren't spying.
We swear.

We just live next door
and we saw somebody moving in.

Would you like to come in
for some tea and cookies?

Bart!
Put that down.

John Amos!

John Amos?

Tea and cookies at once!

Good help is so hard
to find these days.

Is there something
wrong with your face?

Bart,
that's rude.

No, I like directness.

It shows strength.

My face long ago decided
it would reflect my regret.

What is that
supposed to mean?

It means "time ravages."

Can't you fix it?

Bart.

There's no point

in trying to bring back
what's gone.

I am but a nun.

Where'd you get
all this money from?

Again, rude.

It's family money

passed down
from my father.

But money isn't
everything, Bart,

especially when you don't
have anyone to share it with.

You don't have any family?

I did once,
but not anymore.

Now it's just me
and John Amos.

He used to serve
Malcolm, my father.

John Amos, the polaroid.

Ah.

Can I have
a picture with you?

Why do you want
a picture of us?

Stand over here.

You're both
so full of life.

You remind me of myself
when I was your age.

Smile for the camera.

Done.

What is that?

The painting.

That picture I told you that
wasn't to be seen, you idiot.

It must have been the movers.

Put it in the office.
Out of sight.

-As you wish.
-Now!

Boys!

Can I get
another photo?

Stand right there.

Thank you.

This will be
much better.

It's just darling.

I guess.

I'm going to
keep this.

I want to see more of you
in person.

Would you consider
taking after-school jobs

to help me unpack
and tend to my greenhouse?

I have ballet classes,
so that would be hard.

He has a girlfriend, too.

Bart!

I'm sure the girls
love you, too, Bart.

Not really.

Well, they will.

Well, what do you
think about the job?

Well, we would have to
check and make sure

it's okay with
our mom and dad first.

You mean Cathy
and Christopher?

How did you know
their names?

I was told by the realtor.

And I'm Mrs. foxworth.

Well, we'd better
get going.

It's getting
pretty late.

Think about those jobs.

Yeah.

Come on, Bart.

Bart?

Why don't you
come back sometime?

Just you.

Just me?

I think you know
how special you are.

And special people
deserve special attention,

and I do have
a lot of money,

like you noticed,

but money has never
bought me happiness,

and what I really want
is grandchildren

to spoil with gifts.

Gifts?
Like what kind of gifts?

Even a pet snake?

Eww. But yes, darling,
even a pet snake.

Bart. Come on.

It's late.

Jory.

Yeah?

Do you ever wonder
about your dad?

Your real dad?

Sometimes.

But, honestly,
i feel like

Chris is my real dad.

Julian
is just, uh...

My biological father.

What brought this up?

I don't know.

Just...

Wondering...

About...

My biological dad.

You don't remember
him at all?

I was too young.

You weren't even born
when he died.

All I really remember
is Chris.

Why do you think
we've never really met

anybody in our family?

None of mom
or dad's family?

You know why. Okay?

Mom's mom is locked up
in the loony bin,

and her dad's dead.

And dad's mom and dad
are dead, too,

so there's really nobody
to meet.

There aren't any cousins
or uncles?

Not everybody's
family's that close.

Okay?

Anyway... I'm gonna
go meet melodie.

Why are you doing,
meeting melodie so late?

She needed help
with the take-home quiz.

I see.

Well, I don't think she could
ask for a better tutor.

Sweetheart...

I heard you talking to jory.

And all
you need to know

is that your father
was a wonderful man.

That's why I named
you after him.

But jory is right.

Chris really is your father
in so many more ways.

He supported me
and you and jory,

he's been there for us
since the beginning.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So let's just leave
the past in the past.

You don't want to hurt
Chris's feelings, do you?

By bringing up Bart?

No.

Okay, then.

You should be concentrating
on playing and school

and girls...

Well, maybe not
girls just yet.

Oh, Bart!

I'm so happy you came
to visit with me again.

You know, without
that thing on,

your face doesn't
look that bad

for being 80
or whatever.

Wow! I'm not
that long in the tooth,

but thank you,
I'm flattered.

You planted
all of these?

John Amos did,
but I instructed.

Have you thought about
that job?

Yeah, I want to do it.

I wanna save up some money
to get a bow and arrow.

My dad
won't get me one.

Well, if they're not gonna
spoil you,

then I will.

Will you hand me
that tray?

Whoa!

I see you've found
your new little pet.

He's mine?

You got him for me?

What do I do with him?

I can't take him home.
Mom and dad will get really mad.

They need to loosen up.

You can keep him here.

Why would you
get a present like this?

You just met me.

Well, what if I told you
I'm not a total stranger?

What do you mean?

What if I told you
that we're related?

That our lineage
is inextricably connected,

like the rose to the Thorn?

You have your--

your great-grandfather's ears
and nose.

What does that mean?

I'm your grandmother, Bart.

Your mom takes after me,
doesn't she?

So you got out of
the mental institution?

I was never in
a mental institution.

It was an outpatient
clinic.

You make it sound
like I'm crazy.

So why did you
move next to us

and not tell mom?

There were
hard feelings.

Family is complicated.

Very complicated.

But nevertheless,

family must always
stick together.

That's why
i was dedicated

to finding you,

and I'm determined
to make things right.

You mustn't tell Cathy
or Chris about me.

I'll tell them myself
when the time is right.

My dad's come up with
a "no secrets" policy

in our family.

He did?

Oh, that's very ironic.

There's nothing
wrong with a secret

if it's a little one,

and it's for the best.

You're old enough to understand
complicated things like this.

We need that big, beautiful
foxworth brain of yours

to make things right.

Lad? Come here.

Let me tell you something.

I've known your grandmother
a long time.

She's a persistent woman.

She's come here
to get her family back,

and to make things right.

I have no doubt
that she'll succeed.

In the meantime...
I have something for you.

Now... please stay here
for a minute.

I'm going to give you a lesson
in the family history.

Your great-grandfather,
Malcolm foxworth,

was a smart man.

He was a tycoon.

He built an empire.

And he was once
one of the most powerful men

in America.

And you know what?

I see the same qualities he had
in you.

The same energy,

tenacity,

smarts.

You're just like him.

Your great-grandfather's
journal.

One of the only things
left of him.

Malcolm spoke the truth.

Maybe you can learn
a thing or two,

and avoid the moral pitfalls

that have trapped
so many others.

What does that mean?

It means you can choose
a moral life,

a righteous life,

a great life...

Or you can choose to shy away
from the light of god.

You cannot tell
your parents about this.

You can't even
tell jory.

<i> "July 12, 1943.</i>

<i> "Life is a solitary existence,</i>

<i> "but out of that solitude,</i>

<i> "with a little ingenuity,</i>

<i> "and with</i>
<i> the strength of god,</i>

<i> I can bring about triumph."</i>

:<i> "Why?</i>

<i> "Because I do not let</i>

<i> weakness and sin</i>
<i> distract me from greatness.</i>

<i> "And sin</i>

<i> originated</i>
<i> from one creature."</i>

<i> "Nothing else has</i>
<i> the power to drive a man</i>

<i> to do what is against</i>
<i> his better judgement</i>

<i> than lust for women.</i>

<i> A woman can make a man</i>
<i> abandon his friends,</i>

<i> abandon his morals,</i>

<i> abandon his dreams.</i>

<i> Women will make a man soft."</i>

<i> "It is up to a man</i>
<i> to resist this seduction,</i>

<i> this temptation,</i>
<i> this sin,</i>

<i> or it will destroy him.</i>

<i> And in time,</i>

<i> we shall pay for</i>
<i> each of our transgressions."</i>

<i> "And our children</i>
<i> will pay for them, too.</i>

We will pay for these sins
with our blood..."

"...and our pain."

It was
a fairly simple procedure,

so I let him sew her up
after I was done,

and he stitched his sleeve
to her arm.

He didn't!

Is it the same guy

who threw up
on the operating table?

-Yes.
-Jory!

Thank god, she was
unconscious for that,

or that'd have been
a lawsuit and a half.

Honey, that guy
sounds like an oaf!

What is he still
doing there?

Honey?

Are you okay?

I'm fine.

I got it, Emma.

Who would be
calling at this hour?

Probably
telemarketers.

Yeah.

Hello.

<i> Hello.</i>

Hi, marisha.

She never gets
the time difference right,

does she?

Jory, your grandmother
would like to talk to you.

Yeah.

Oh, honey,
don't tell your grandmother

about the ballet recital.

-Okay.
-Okay?

Hi, grandma.

Yeah, I'm trying to.

Of course.

Chris, I know
she's eccentric,

but why do you
hate her so much?

You don't like her
any more than I do.

What I think
isn't important.

She's his grandmother.

He's allowed
to talk to her.

Why can't i
talk to my grandmother?

Your grandmother?

Your mom.

The one
in the mental institution?

Well, Bart, that's, um...

That's very complicated.

I haven't spoken to her
in years.

Not since
before Chris and I met.

Honey, are you okay?

You look a little peaked.

Yeah.

Are you sure?

Yes, grandma.

Yes, of course, I'll tell her.

Okay, well, um,
try and finish your dinner.

Can I be excused?

Sure.

I'm sure
I'll hear soon.

Yeah. Of course.

I'm gonna go check on him.

I don't need you
to check on me!

What is it, boy?

Come on.

Cathy?

Cathy?

Cathy?

What are you
doing here?

Nothing.
I'm just cleaning up.

How long have you
been at this?

A few days.

This looks a lot like
the attic at foxworth...

Chris, how can you
even say that?

I'm not planning on
locking anyone up in here.

I am not mother.

I'm not suggesting
you're mother,

but what are you doing here?

I don't know.

I don't know, I just
want to keep our family safe,

and if we adopt Cindy--

if we adopt Cindy, it's not
gonna help keep the family safe.

Chris, we have
to adopt her.

She's just a little girl.
She has no one.

She's just like we were--
completely alone.

Okay.

Okay.

I hear you.

We'll adopt Cindy, but...

All of this...

It's just in case.

In case anyone
finds out about us.

I couldn't stand the thought of
anyone taking our children away.

Come on.

We are thousands
of miles away

from foxworth hall,

from all of that...

No one's going to
take our children, Cathy.

I won't let that happen.

Oh, hey, jor.

Hey.

What're you up to?

Just finished the laundry.

Where's your brother?

I thought he was up here.

Bart?

He's not downstairs, either.

Well, he shouldn't
be outside.

I think he's coming
down with something.

-What is it?
-Bart's not in the house.

What?

Let's not panic.
Come on.

Let's go look for him.

Okay.

Bart!

Bart!

Come on, Bart!
Where are you?

Bart!

--Where is he? Where is he?

Bart!

Bart!

Bart! You out here?

Bart!

Bart! Bart! What's wrong?

Mom! Dad! Over here!

Jory!

Jory,
where are you?

Here!

Jesus! Bart!

When did this happen?

Bart!

Is he gonna be okay?

Oh, my god.

Oh, my god!

Okay, I got it.
Get off of me!

Okay, Bart,
just please--

no! Get off of me!

It's okay, it's okay.

Can you hold him down?

Yeah, I've got him.

Take it easy.
Let go!

Chris, what are
they doing to him?

He's had an adverse reaction
to the antibiotics.

What does that mean?

Means he's allergic
to everything.

Why?

Why is he so weak?

His father wasn't weak.

I'm not weak.

This is all her fault.

This family is still
paying for her sins.

No, no.
That is not true.

Shh.

I need a crash cart!

<i> Open your eyes,</i>

<i> see what is in front of you,</i>

<i> for the lord said</i>

<i>that you shall learn the truth,</i>

<i> and the truth</i>
<i> shall set you free!</i>

<i> Dr. sugarman, line three.</i>

<i> Dr. sugarman, line three.</i>

My sweet little boy...

My strong little boy.

Please wake up.

Please...

It's mommy.

Here, dad.

Thank you, son.

Here, honey.
Take one of these.

Oh, Chris,
i don't need it.

It's just valium.

You're a nervous wreck, darling,
and you need to sleep.

You've been up all night.

Hold on to this.

Okay, hon.
Let's let him sleep.

: Okay.

<i> ...and the truth</i>

<i> shall set you free...</i>

<i> I am alone</i>
<i> in my search for the truth...</i>

<i> And sinners all around me</i>
<i> live with lies and deceit.</i>

<i>People looking into our past...</i>

<i> Do they not know</i>
<i> the hellfire that awaits them?</i>

<i> There are ways</i>
<i> around that.</i>

<i> If lying lips are</i>
<i> an abomination to the lord...</i>

<i> Then secrets must be revealed.</i>

<i> And the sins</i>
<i> of these lustful liars</i>

<i> must be paid for.</i>

It's Cindy's mother...

She's gone.

Oh, hon',
i am so sorry.

Just... I just hope

Bart's gonna be
okay with it.

He'll adapt.

He'll have to.

A girl needs a home,
and we made a promise.

Oh, I have never
been so worried in my life.

I was a nervous wreck.
I really was.

We were all
worried, Bart.

But now my boy
is as good as new.

You know, nurse,

I think I can take it
from here. Thank you.

I bet you're excited
to be coming home, son.

Well, what would you
like for dinner? Hmm?

You must be famished.

How about, um...
Pork chops?

With, um, applesauce
and, um...

Oh! I can make a yellow cake
with chocolate frosting.

Hmm? What do you
think, sweetie?

I'm not "sweet."

People who are sweet
are kind,

and people who are kind
are weak.

Where'd you hear
that, Bart?

Nowhere. Why?

We just--

I... knew somebody
who used to say that,

that's all.

What about Emma's
famous marshmallow pie?

Hmm? What do
you think?

I think
you talk too much.

Look who's home!

There she is!

Hey, peanut.
Welcome home.

It's official.

Hey, sweetie! Oh...

My Cindy's here.

Oh! Aren't we lucky
to have a little girl?

Oh, look who's there--
it's big brother, Bart.

Hi, Bart.

Hey, Bart.

Go give him a hug, Cindy bear.

I'll take your jacket.

Oh... she's so cute.

Aww. She loves you, Bart!

Sweetie?

Where are you going?

To work on
my bug collection.

Okay.

Let's get started on lunch.

I'm sure he'll be just fine

once he gets back into
his regular routine.

Come on.

Bart.

I'm so glad
you're feeling better!

I've missed you!

Come in.
We must celebrate!

These are good.

Well, you deserve
the best of everything,

including your cookies.

How about a twirl
with your grandma?

You listen
to this old music?

It's not old!

It might as well
be yesterday.

Well, grandma,
i have a question.

You have a painting.

I have many paintings, darling.

This one looks
kind of like my dad.

Not my real dad,
but Chris.

Well, a lot of people
resemble each other.

It must be
a coincidence.

I'm told that I look
like Jean Harlow.

It's in here,
in the living room.

Where did it go?

Well, maybe the fever you had
scrambled your brain.

Whenever that happens to me,
i always take a cold bath.

My mom told me
she met Chris

after she stopped
talking to you.

So how do you
know Chris?

Bart...

Please, tell me.

Why would he say
he never met you if he did?

Tell me!

Or I'll think
you're a horrible liar.

What could be
so horrible?

Did you do something?

Something to make them
both hate you?

They don't hate me,
do they?

I'm a good woman.

If you're a good woman,

why would he say
he never met you if he did?

Why would you not
want to tell me

that that was
a painting of him?

Because he's my son, Bart.

My dad is your s-son, and...

My mom is your daughter?

Then...

I think you understand.

It's one of my biggest failings
as a parent.

And as a parent,
you feel somewhat responsible,

though you aren't
in the least.

But still, despite everything,
i love them.

As mothers do.

Why didn't you tell me?

I wanted to protect you,

and there's nothing
that this knowledge can do

except complicate things,

but you're very curious,
and now you understand.

It's why they've kept me
away all these years.

It's why I had my breakdown
in the first place.

It's been awful for me...

And I can only imagine how awful
it must be for you now.

I can't believe it.

Bart, you must
promise

that you will never
speak of this to anyone,

or it will ruin your life.

Do you understand me?

Did...

Did you know my real father?

Oh, Bart.

You are too curious,

and, as they say,
curiosity killed the cat.

Did you know him?

I'm feeling faint.

So... faint.

All I want
is my family back.

Never mind the past.

I guess
i should get going.

My mom will wonder where I am.

You hung that painting!
You imbecile!

Now his mind is churning
and asking questions.

I'm trying
to handle this delicately,

so I can win him,

and he'll convince them
to take me back.

I'm sorry.

It was
a genuine mistake.

Get out of my sight!

Sins...

Sins must be paid for.

But how?

You almost killed me, clover.

You know that?

Nice one!

Who knocked it over
last time?

So, melodie,
have you decided

which university
you're gonna go to?

Father wants me to go
to college in new england.

He says California universities
are overrun by leftists.

Well, when
you're finished,

you should definitely
come back here.

I mean, you're practically
part of the family.

-Mom!
-What?

You don't want to be
part of this family.

Our blood is cursed.

I'm just kidding.

It's not like our family's
plagued with dark secrets

or hypocrisy.

Um...

Lunch is ready.

Let's all
get washed up.

<i> "Listen not to false prophets</i>

<i> who will try to bend you</i>

<i> it is in the guise of a woman,</i>

<i> sometimes in the guise of men</i>

<i>corrupted by women."</i>

What's wrong
with you? Huh?

Hey! I'm talking to you!

Why would you
try and embarrass me

in front of my girlfriend
like that today?

Huh? And what the hell
were you talking about?

What was I talking about?

Why am I so screwed up, huh?

Why do I have allergies,

and why am I so much shorter
than everybody else in my grade?

Hey.

You're just different, okay?
That's all.

We're all different.

No! When you live
around a sin,

it starts
to infect you.

Why are you talking
like such a weirdo?

What sin?

Why don't you ask them?

I think
you need some sleep.

Leave.

Now!

Clover!

Come here, boy!

Mom? Dad?

Have you seen
clover anywhere?

I can't find him.

He'll come around
when he's hungry.

He always does.

I'm gonna go outside
and look for him.

I think Bart should
see a professional.

You mean like a psychiatrist?

It'll be good
just to get confirmation

that he's going
through a phase.

<i> Sometimes,</i>
<i> things like an accident</i>

or a very high fever,
for instance,

can exacerbate an underlying
psychological condition--

something that's there,
but remains dormant.

Let me ask.

Has there any history of abuse,

inversion,

deviance,

or mental illness
in the family?

No. No.
Not at all.

Perhaps we can put together
your genetic history.

His biological
father is dead.

Hmm.

Well, you know,
then what I propose,

is that before we start him
on any medication,

we continue to monitor him.

Bart is a very bright,
but also a very...

Sensitive young man.

Adolescence can be even more
difficult for somebody like him.

This could just be hormones.

But I do believe that, in time,
Bart's gonna be just fine.

Bart?

I want to pay you
for today.

Grandma...

Please tell me
about my father.

Did you really
know him?

If you insist.

Your father--

Bart--Bart Scott winslow--

he was a good man.

As you probably know,

he died tragically
in a fire

before you were born.

And my mom
introduced you to him?

I knew him
long before your mother did.

How?

I don't want to go down
this twisted road.

I fear it could
complicate things even more.

But look--

I got you a gift.

John Amos?
Bring it here.

I think you're really
gonna like it.

Whoa.

How did you know
i wanted one?

Because you told me,
and I listened.

Now, you should play
with that in the barn,

and away from
the valuables here.

Let's go.

Why do you think grandma
gets so upset about my dad?

It's a...

A twisted...

Twisted web.

I don't know much
about it myself.

Let's try this
again, hmm?

Alright.

Watch your feet.

Do the Archer's "t."

Hmm...

Elbow up.

Put your forefinger
to the mouth.

String to the nose,
and...

Wow, you're a natural.

Let me tell you
something, Bart.

You have the potential
to be very powerful.

Malcolm wasn't born
with all of this.

No one expected him
to amount to anything.

He was small,
but he thought big.

I don't want anyone
to take advantage of you.

You're a good boy,

but you must look out
for yourself.

Like Malcolm?

Exactly.

You have to Blaze
your own path.

The righteous path!

And there
will be people

that will stand
in your way.

And women will try
to undermine you

at every turn,

and use the evil
that they have

to get you to do
their wicked bidding.

And you can't let them.

Hmm?

See? Keep up with
your practice,

and one day,
you can be

as graceful
as miss melodie.

Class dismissed.

Guess what?

I have my mom's
car today.

I want to--
i want to, I really do.

I just have to get home,
okay?

I'm sorry.

I just have
this feeling that...

Bart needs me.

Bart!

Bart!

Are you up in the treehouse?

Bart!

Bart!

Bart! Come on.

Clover?
Clover, is that you?

Ahh!

What are you
doing in here?

Entertaining myself,

since you were... busy.

Where'd you get
the bow and arrow?

Grandma
got it for me.

"Grandma?"

Bart, look--

I want you to stay
away from this place,

and stay away
from that woman.

Okay? She's not
your grandmother.

You don't
want to see

what's in front of
your own face, sometimes, boy.

You let your feelings dictate,

and it's made you weak.

And a man who feels

is weak.

I found clover, Bart.

He's dead.

Do you know
anything about that?

You think I killed him?

I could never hurt an animal!

If you don't
stay away from this place,

I'm gonna tell mom and dad
what you did!

You'd lie?

You want me sent away,
don't you?

Like they sent away grandma!

I'm looking out
for you, okay?

You're just worrying me.

If you say anything,

I will tell them

that you are fornicating
with melodie in the attic.

You didn't
think I knew?

I saw you!

Doing it.

It's a sin out of wedlock,
you know.

It's why we're not
friends anymore.

You disgust me.

You're not gonna
say anything now...

Are you?

Why are you
being like this?

Isn't it obvious,
or are you blind?

Mom and dad didn't meet
the way they said they did.

They lied to you
about grandma.

They lied to you
about everything.

Bart, you're acting crazy.

"Crazy"
is denying reality, boy.

It wasn't an accident.

The wire was wrapped
too carefully around clover.

Who would do such a thing?

It's just awful.

I don't know,

but I'll talk to the kids
and tell them to be careful.

Emma, if you could keep
an extra eye on the kids, too.

Of course.

Bart...

What are you
doing here?

It's late.

I don't want
to go home.

Are you okay?

It's nothing.

Are you sure?

It's just...

If you do love me,
like you say you do...

You're the only one.

Ohh...

You and John Amos.

John Amos?

He can't love you,
he's-- he's just a servant.

But a smart one.

Not really.

He said I could be
just like Malcolm.

Malcolm?
He told you that?

He told you
about... Malcolm?

Oh. Darling...

As much as I would love
to have you stay here,

your parents will be
wondering about you,

and you should be
getting home.

What have you been
telling my grandson?

Nothing, ma'am.

How does he know
about Malcolm?

I don't know.
I thought you--

I don't
pay you to think!

I pay you to do!
What have you told him?

I've told him
nothing, ma'am.

I believe he mentioned

reading an old journal
of Malcolm's.

I assumed you gave it to him

in an attempt
to reveal the truth,

as you said
you would.

I did no such thing.

Bart is very impressionable!

And I can't have him

falling subject
to the wrong influences.

Now find me the journal

and get it back to me
immediately!

As you wish.

<i> "Dearest Cathy,</i>

<i> "i love you.</i>

<i> "So much.</i>

<i> "And truly,</i>
<i> it's the only consolation</i>

<i> of being locked</i>
<i> in this prison together."</i>

<i> "One day,</i>
<i> when we're grown,</i>

<i> "we can leave this behind,</i>

<i>"and start a new life together,</i>

<i> "and never look back.</i>

<i> Happy 13th birthday."</i>

<i> "Love, Chris."</i>

You're so tense.

But massages are
good for development.

And you're
maturing nicely.

When are you going to
tell me about Bart?

My father.

Who was he?

He was my husband.

I don't understand.

Your mother
was very angry at me,

irrationally so,

and so she seduced
my husband,

your poor grandmother's
husband.

Why?

I don't know.

I don't know why
they hate me like they do,

just because I want them
to lead decent lives

and do the right thing.

Can you blame me?

But listen to me,
for all the pain,

and the trauma
that this has caused me,

you're the result,

and I wouldn't wish it
to be any different.

You're here,
and you're alive.

You remind me
so much of him.

You're the son
that I was meant to have,

more or less.

Oh, Bart.

Promise me that
you'll never leave me,

like they did.

Promise me?

I never will, grandma.

Are you okay, jory?

What's wrong?

I don't know.

I guess I'm just worried
about my brother.

Sometimes...

He says
these crazy things.

Like what?

I don't know.

Some stuff
about my parents.

It just doesn't
make any sense.

Why don't you
ask your mom?

It's probably nothing.

Want to watch
my Dolly swim?

Mommy gave it
to me.

You know what?

She's not your mommy.

And I'm not
your brother.

And you're not
a part of this family!

Bart! What are you doing?

Stop! Get off!

Mom!

Oh, my god! Honey!

What is wrong
with you? Huh?

What is going on with you?

Why would you try
and hurt Cindy?

Why do you hate
her so much?

She's your sister!
You should love her!

No! I shouldn't!

Brothers shouldn't
love their sisters.

Isn't that right,
Chris?

Alright!
That is enough!

Let's go!

Come on!

-What's happening?
-Cindy had an accident.

-What's going on?
-She's okay. Just take her.

Sweetie,
you're gonna be okay.

Shh, it's okay.

-Go on.
-Get off of me, Chris!

Enough of that!

You get in there.

You stay in there
until you calm down.

You're not my father!

You're just
pretending to be!

What are you doing?

He needs to calm down a little,
and we need some time to think.

You're devil spawn!

You're a sinner!
And a hypocrite!

Fornicating
with his sister!

Cursing this family!

You deserve to die!

You all deserve to die!

How does he know, Chris?

How?

I don't know!

We'll figure it out.

God knows we've been
through worse.

What are we doing?

What is wrong with him,
that he's like this?

Dr. Phillips
ought to know.

We can't take him back
to Dr. Phillips!

What if he tells her
what he knows?

He's unstable,

so she'll think
he's making it up.

And what if they want
to lock him up, Chris?

I will never
let that happen.

Chris! Please.

Just-- just
give me a moment.

Let me out!

There you are, jory.

What's going on?

Your parents...

As you know them,

are more than
what you think.

"More" how?

It's very difficult.

No child should have to
hear this about their parents.

I want you to be strong.

Can you be?

Bart...

Tell me what happened
with your sister.

She's not my sister.

And I'm not Bart.

Then who are you?

Mr. and Mrs. sheffield.

I'm concerned
that Bart is displaying

features of
a schizophrenic disorder.

He said he didn't hurt Cindy,

that it was somebody else.

An old man
he calls "Malcolm."

Malcolm?

That's impossible.

Um...

What are our options?

We'd like to take him
away from here

as soon as possible.

Well, there's been
some major advances

in electroshock therapy--

what? No! No.
Absolutely not.

I agree.

Alright.
If you insist.

We can try medications,

but I'd like to keep him
here at the hospital

just for a few days,
for observation.

But I'm afraid,
if that doesn't work,

our only option left
will be shock therapy.

Hmm.

Well, the tranquilizers have
calmed him down considerably.

So, Dr. Phillips,

when you were
speaking with Bart,

did he say anything
else strange at all?

Nothing worth repeating.

I'll stay here tonight.

Oh, no, no. That--
that won't be necessary.

I'm his mother.
I insist.

And I'll stay with her.
Thank you, doctor.

Morning, jory.

Where's Cindy?

Emma took her
to the park.

Your mom, uh,
is still at the hospital.

Bart's still resting.

Everything okay, son?

Bart say
something crazy to you?

About what?

I don't know.

About the family?

About this family?

I don't know, Chris.

What could
possibly be wrong

with this perfect
family you've created?

What could Bart be so upset
about, huh, Chris?

Listen, why are you so angry?

And why do you keep
calling me "Chris"?

Why don't you ask grandma?

She's living next door.

Ah... Dr. dollanganger.

"Sheffield."

Ah, yes. Of course.

Do come in.

There you are.

All grown up.

Corrine.

Call me "mother,"
and give me a hug.

Don't touch me.

What are you
doing here, corrine?

Haven't you done enough
to Cathy and me?

I was hoping that
you could forgive me.

Cathy won't,

but you've always loved me
more than she did.

So you come here

and you manipulate Bart
into hating us?

No! I only wanted to love him

the way that a grandmother
loves a grandchild.

I wanted my family back.

But he knows, corrine.

They both know.

You've poisoned
my family again!

If your family
loves you based on a lie,

then they don't love you at all,
do they?

Oh, you should know,
shouldn't you?

But I've changed!

I can help them
have a normal life.

I can raise them properly,

and if not both of them,
then just Bart.

He's such a special boy.

A "normal life?"

Does any of this
seem normal to you?

There is nothing
"normal" about you

or about what you think
might help them

in that fetid, rotten
head of yours.

You stay away
from my children, corrine,

or so help me,
i will make it my life's mission

to see you locked back up,
for good this time.

I'm a doctor.

I have those powers.

And I have a lot of friends.

Yes, but they don't know
your secret, do they?

Stay away from my children,
corrine.

Chris, I need to talk to you.

I was out getting

some last-minute things
for the recital,

and the charge card
was declined.

-It was?
-Yeah.

Must've forgot to pay a bill.

No.

I went to the bank
to withdraw some money,

and there's
hardly any in there.

Cathy, uh,
don't worry yourself.

Chris!
What is going on?

You're a doctor,
you earn good money,

you work all the time.

Why on earth are we
having financial problems?

Darling, please,

don't distract
yourself before the show.

I'm taking care
of everything, okay?

Chris, I'm on
my last nerve here.

I know you're angry
at Chris and Cathy.

I know you want them to pay
for their sins.

But you have to hold back
until the time is right.

Malcolm was a smart man.

He knew that, sometimes,

you have to pretend to be
what people want you to be

in order
to prevail over them.

You have to disguise
your intentions,

so they suspect nothing.

Do you understand?

Good boy.

I don't revolt
you, do I?

Melodie?

Hey...

I'm sorry.

Hey, there.

How are you
feeling, Bart?

Okay.

And how is Malcolm feeling?

He went away.

Oh, he did, did he?

Yeah.

And I don't think
he's coming back, either.

Huh.

Cindy, honey!
Hurry up.

We don't want to be late
for the recital.

Hi, Dr. Phillips.

Yes, the medications
have worked tremendously.

No. No more episodes.

He's been
perfectly stable and happy,

and completely abandoned

this fictitious
"Malcolm" character.

Thank you. Yes.
I'll, uh, be in touch.

Bart, honey, are you sure

you don't want to come
to the recital?

Okay.

See you there.

Bye, darling.

-Bye, Cindy.
-Bye-bye.

Break a leg.

Thank you. Thank you,

and welcome to the sheffield
dance academy's fall recital.

We are so excited to show you
what we've been working on,

and we hope you enjoy it.

So without further ado,
let's begin.

And arms in first position...

And in fifth...

And open.

And... up.

And...

Oh!

Cathy!

Don't move your leg.

-My knee--
-shh, shh...

Chris, Chris, my knee!

Oh, god!

You're fine.
You're gonna be fine.

Oh, god!

Son, go get an ambulance.

Okay.

Oh, Chris... my knee.

You're gonna be okay.
I'm here.

Chris, I'm fine.

I can manage.

I'm gonna have to,
if I'm going to dance again.

Hi, sweetie.
It's good to be home. Mwah.

Hey, honey.

Does she know

she's never gonna
dance again?

They told her at the hospital,
but it hasn't sunk in yet.

Mind your leg.

Well...

I think it's a good thing.

You know, I can, uh...

Ooh. Focus on myself,

my beautiful family.

Where's my little Cindy?

Emma put her
to bed already.

Bart?

Wanna come give me a hug?

Grandma!

Darling!

Jory, darling.

Your grandmother is here.

Look at you!

My luggage--
it's in the trunk.

I'll get it.

Thank you
so much, Amy.

-"Emma."
-Indeed.

Cathy...

I was so sorry
to hear about your accident.

The moment jory told me,
i knew what I had to do.

-You came.
-Of course!

Who else is going to
teach your classes?

Amy? Do you have
sugar for the coffee?

Still "Emma."

It's my guilty little pleasure.

Well, I see you haven't lost
your<i> joie de vivre.</i>

I just hope I have mine
when I'm your age.

So, how long were you
planning on staying with us?

As long as it takes
to put jory into tiptop shape.

He has a bright
future ahead of him.

He does.

I've taught him
everything I know.

Exactly.

And now with your knee

and your delightful
little girl,

I can relieve
some of your burden,

and take jory even further.

Jory?

Why don't you take your
grandmother's bags upstairs?

To the guest room.

Yeah.

I'm sure you'd like to
get settled in, marisha.

I'll just finish my coffee.

Christopher,
you startled me.

A ballerina who smokes?

We all have
our unsavory habits,

don't we, now?

Haven't I done
enough for you?

You promised to stay
out of our lives.

The arrangement we've made
is no longer working for me.

Chris? Honey?

Sweetheart.

Are you okay?

What is it?

It's marisha.

She knows about us.

A couple of years ago,

her studio wasn't
doing well...

She came to me
for money.

And when I refused...

She threatened to turn us in
and take jory away.

She's blackmailing us?

Chris, you should have told me!

I didn't want to worry you.

I'm gonna kill her.

No.

No!

We have to play this
smart, Cathy.

She has all the leverage.

Don't do or say anything rash
until we come up with a plan.

It's the hospital.

I got to go.

Okay.

We'll figure this out.

I promise.

This family
means everything to me.

Cathy, darling.

I'm looking for
the reduced-fat mayonnaise.

I want you to get the hell
out of my house,

or I'm calling the police.

I beg your pardon?

I know what
you're doing,

and I will never
let you have jory.

He's mine.

Look.

I know how
a mother feels about her son,

and how protective she can be,

but this
is for the best.

You're not
taking my son.

I'm looking after
his best interests.

He has a future,

and back in New York,

he'll no longer
have to participate

in this putrid farce.

It's damaging him.

Look at what it's done
to your other boy.

He's nuts,
and no wonder.

Oh, Bart, honey!
Don't listen to her.

She doesn't know
what she's saying!

Bart? Bart!

Oh, dammit.

You think I'm afraid of you?
Well, I'm not!

But you're afraid
of what I can tell everyone,

aren't you?

Do what you're gonna do.

I just don't
give a damn anymore.

Bart!

Hello, Bart.

I know I'm supposed to pretend
like it's all okay,

but their sinning
makes me sick.

Their hypocrisy--
all of them.

Well, if sin and hypocrisy
don't sit well with you...

I'm not sure if, uh...

If what?

I shouldn't say anything.
It's not my place.

It is your place.

You're just a servant,
John Amos.

You don't get to decide
what to tell me

and what not to tell me.

I'm just saying

that if sin and hypocrisy
don't sit well with you,

maybe you shouldn't be
with your grandma either.

What does that mean?

Are you saying--

I'm saying that she pretends
to be all high and mighty...

But she's a sinner, too.

No, she's not!

How dare you?

Listen to me, Bart.

Don't you think that

Chris and Cathy learned
their behavior somehow?

Where do you think
they got it from?

Some years ago...

I discovered

that she had had relations
with her own uncle.

No.

That's how
your mom and Chris were born.

So I'm paying for their sins?

Hello?

Bart?

Oh, my god.

<i> Jory, she can't</i>
<i>come to the phone right now.</i>

Can I just please
just talk to her?

<i> I can't.</i>

Melodie? Melodie!

I-i know you're there.

Hello?

Hello?

Jory, there's something
i want to discuss with you.

About what?

About your
so-called parents.

Grandma, I know already.

Okay?

I am so sorry.

They're ill, jory.

Crazy.

Listen to me.

You have such a bright
future ahead of you,

but you need to
get out of this mess.

I'll book a ticket.

We can both go
back to New York.

We could leave first
thing in the morning

and never look back.

Bart?

Hello, dear.

I've come back.

So it was you
at the recital.

I want you
to stay away from my children

and leave us
the hell alone!

Cathy, I may never get
another chance to say this--

I prayed!

I prayed
that you had died.

I prayed that you'd died
in that nut farm!

Oh, Cathy,
if only you knew how it hurts

to hear you say those things
after all these years.

I only came here
to be near you.

I don't want you near me!

Move!

Go away! I hate you!

Please, give me
another chance.

This time,

I can be the loving mother
that I should have been

to you and Chris.

You gave up
our love!

You gave up our love
for money,

and for this--
for damn jewelry!

You locked us in an attic
for<i> three years!</i>

Cathy, I always manage
to make the wrong decisions.

I think they're right
when I make them...

But they never
prove anything but wrong.

You stole my childhood!

I've made terrible mistakes.

Everything
is falling apart,

because of you.

Everything is falling apart!

My life!

Everything Chris and i
have worked to build!

Did I damage you both so deeply
that you can never heal, Cathy?

Do you really
love your brother?

Yes, I love him.

You made me love him.

What the hell are you doing?

I'm putting an end

to the affliction
that plagues this family.

Are they alive?

Watch them.

I'm going to get
the wheelbarrow.

We're taking them
to the barn.

Be strong, boy.

Grandma.

Oh, darling...

What's happened?

Get me some rope. Now!

John Amos.

Have you gone mad?

Yes, I have.

From wasting my life

serving you, you weak,
undisciplined wretch!

You're a servant.

It's your damned job.

What have you done
to my daughter?

Do you have any idea
how hard it's been,

tying my life to yours?

To serve
a once-great family

that's gone down
the path of sin?

That's tarnished its name,
and through its name, mine?

We're not really family.

You're an employee.

I thought that, perhaps,
you had learned something

when you gave these sinners up.

I thought that
you had rejected

the sin you had created,

and moved on!

No.

You wanted it all back!

You and your children.

And your children's
children!

All tainted!

All the devil's spawn.

You sound insane.

Just like
my damned, crazy mother.

Really?

What are you doing?

You're weak, corrine.

But I am strong.

I have been given
the strength of the lord,

and I will break
this cycle of abomination,

and make you pay!

I will set this place ablaze.

No!

I must.

These women
must pay for their sins.

The lord whispered it in my ear.

There's nothing of the lord
in you.

You're just...

A false prophet.

Don't you mess with me, Bart,

or you will end up
just like your damned dog!

--Bart! Run! Run!

You little bastard!

Bart!

No! Let go!
Get off of me!

John Amos, stop it!
Stop it!

You'll never
get away with this!

Oh, I believe I will.

The lord protects his own.

Don't, don't, don't...

Bye, corrine.

Jory, what
are you doing?

I'm going back
with marisha.

Son, listen to me.

I'm tired
of listening,

about all of
your lies, okay?

I promise, no more lies.

We'll get everything
out in the open, right now.

Where's your mother?

Next door.

Oh, god.

Just, please, stay here.

Oh, my god! Oh!

Mother, what's going on?

John Amos
has gone crazy

and he's locked us
in here.

What? Oh, my god!
We're gonna die in here?

I may never get another chance
to say this to you--

how much I've loved you,
I've loved all four of you,

and I'm horribly sorry
for everything that I've done.

If I could take it back,
i would.

Can you
forgive me?

Dad, mom and grandma
are trapped in the barn,

and the barn's on fire!

Take me to them.

They're in there! Hurry!

Get out of here!
Stay low!

Cathy, are you in there?

Cathy, can you hear me?

Oh, my god! Chris!

Please take her!

I've got you, Cathy.
I've got you.

Hang on, baby.

Grandma!

Come on, grandma!
Get up!

Go, darling! Go!

Little beast!
You'll get burned, too!

No!

Woman...

You are
the gateway to my hell.

Go, Bart! Go!

Bart!

Dad! Go back in there
and save her!

I saw the smoke.
Are you okay?

Jory, take him.

Jory, let go!

No! Grandma!

We can't
just let her burn!

Oh, my god, Chris.
Mother.

Mother.

Are you okay?

Oh, my god!

I saw the smoke,

and then I couldn't
find you, jory.

Marisha,
this is not the time.

Dad! Dad.

I got her.
Don't worry.

Darling.

Are you okay?

I'm fine.

This family is insane,

and you must
come live with me.

No, grandma.

What do you mean, no?

You want to continue to
live here with these mad people?

Enough!

They might be crazy,
but they're my family.

And I love them.

I'm staying here.

And if you even<i> think</i> about
turning Chris and Cathy in,

I'll never forgive you.

I'll never speak to you again.

I think it's time for you
to go home now, grandma.

I'll see you next Christmas.

Hey. Come here.
Good girl. Good girl.

Want to go get it?

Melodie.

Hi.

I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

I told you
that you could be honest,

that you could trust me,

and when you did...

I freaked out.

But...

That doesn't change
the way I feel about you, jory.

It doesn't?

Oh, I've missed you so much.

You have?

You have!

What did you miss
the most?

I can show you.

Bart!

I want to see, I want to see.

Is he chewing the mouse?

No.

They're just playing.

Are you sure
they're just playing?

Yes, Cindy.

I'll be in my room.

No, no. Young lady,
snakes are icky.

We're going to go to the park.

Dr. Phillips
is a miracle-worker.

Yes, I think
he's back to his old self.

Amen! Our boy is back.
Now let's go get some worms.

Well, I'm gonna get
some of that pie.

We are blessed,
aren't we?

To have
such a wonderful family?

Yes, we are.

Jory? Come on.

Jory?
