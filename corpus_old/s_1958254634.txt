<b>And there are many practical applications</b>

<b>predictable movements</b>

<b>in nonlinear systems.</b>

<b>The world's first consumer product to</b>

<b>This machine produced</b>

<b>Hey, hey, hey, you visionary guy</b>

<b>You can't compare the amount of energy</b>

<b>that the sun expended by making an</b>

<b>analogy to baseball.</b>

<b>[CRACK]</b>

<b>[SCREAMING]</b>

<b>The sun was, let's say,</b>

<b>the batter up at the plate.</b>

<b>The reverse gravitational pull or</b>

<b>Nice barbecue, huh?</b>

<b>[INAUDIBLE]</b>

<b>Well, in the most simple terms, we</b>

<b>The park would be our universe.</b>

<b>Fuck of this.</b>

<b>Oh, science move.</b>

<b>It would have sent us into this--</b>

<b>Here we go.</b>

<b>[CHATTER]</b>

<b>[GROANING]</b>

<b>I love you.</b>

<b>Good night.</b>

<b>- What are you saying? - Home?</b>

<b>- Oh, nothing. - Sick?</b>

<b>- No, no, it's a way sick. - Oh!</b>

<b>(laughing)</b>

<b>- Hey, where you going? - What?</b>

<b>- Huh? - Oh, sorry.</b>

<b>(laughing)</b>

<b>I'm doing that for the rollover.</b>

<b>- Yeah. - Okay.</b>

<b>- How's that? - It's okay. - How's that? - Good.</b>

<b>- Yeah? - One second.</b>

<b>- Oh, okay. - Second?</b>

<b>- You smoking? - Yeah, thanks.</b>

<b>(sighing)</b>

<b>(door opens)</b>

<b>(phone rings)</b>

<b>Hello?</b>

<b>Yeah, 16th, yeah, I remember.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>- It's not fair, it's my turn.</b>

<b>- Mom! - I get it first.</b>

<b>- Mom? - Mom?</b>

<b>- Mom? What's the matter?</b>

<b>What's the matter with her?</b>

<b>- She was okay this morning, right?</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>- Julie, she won't talk.</b>

<b>- I told you. - Well, I</b>

<b>just want to try it, okay?</b>

<b>- Hey, Julie, it's me. - But we tried it</b>

<b>for like half an hour.</b>

<b>- Okay, well, I just want</b>

<b>to try it again, all right?</b>

<b>So Julie, Lisa came over</b>

<b>and she got me, she said, uh,</b>

<b>she said something's</b>

<b>really wrong with you.</b>

<b>What's wrong with you, honey?</b>

<b>- I told you.</b>

<b>- Did you have a fight</b>

<b>with Rick? - She won't talk.</b>

<b>- Lisa. - What? - She's not gonna talk. - Lisa. - What?</b>

<b>- Do you guys want to like,</b>

<b>you know, go up to your rooms</b>

<b>and give us some alone time?</b>

<b>Just leave us alone, all right?</b>

<b>All right?</b>

<b>- Okay. - Yeah.</b>

<b>- Okay, Frankie, come on. - So, Julie, how's things?</b>

<b>It's not so good, huh?</b>

<b>Can you hear me, Julie?</b>

<b>Okay, if you can hear me</b>

<b>like, um, I don't know,</b>

<b>wiggle your feet or wave or something,</b>

<b>I gotta know you can hear me.</b>

<b>Okay, okay, okay.</b>

<b>What's wrong with you, honey?</b>

<b>What you got in your hands, Julie?</b>

<b>Is that what's wrong</b>

<b>with you, got in your hands?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Oh.</b>

<b>Hi.</b>

<b>- You what? - I've had a lot.</b>

<b>You don't wanna what?</b>

<b>I don't wanna be stupid no more.</b>

<b>But Julie, like, I</b>

<b>mean, you're not stupid.</b>

<b>Yeah, yeah, no, you're not stupid at all.</b>

<b>You got two kids, you got a house.</b>

<b>Yeah, yeah.</b>

<b>Well, if I don't mind.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>You don't wanna sh--</b>

<b>what's all over your eye?</b>

<b>You wanna maybe just go see a movie?</b>

<b>I don't know. Go to the mall.</b>

<b>Go see Jana or something.</b>

<b>I wanna-- I wanna-- I</b>

<b>wanna tell you something.</b>

<b>Yeah? Okay.</b>

<b>I hope you don't think--</b>

<b>Wow.</b>

<b>Hoboken high school G.D. courses.</b>

<b>Environmental constraints and</b>

<b>development and construction.</b>

<b>All right.</b>

<b>Computer class.</b>

<b>Okay. - I wanna go.</b>

<b>Do I wanna go to a computer class?</b>

<b>- No. - No.</b>

<b>Were you having a memory lapse?</b>

<b>'Cause you were never so</b>

<b>great in school, honey.</b>

<b>This isn't like school. It's computers.</b>

<b>How do you think that rocket ship Voyager</b>

<b>measured the wind velocity on Neptune</b>

<b>and those radio</b>

<b>emissions from the heliopause?</b>

<b>We wouldn't have known nothing about that</b>

<b>if it wasn't for computers.</b>

<b>Where'd you learn that stuff?</b>

<b>I've been watching TV all day.</b>

<b>Channel 13, nature</b>

<b>programs, beginning physics.</b>

<b>I've been reading.</b>

<b>Magazines.</b>

<b>Omni, discovery, you know, science ones.</b>

<b>Every time I go to the grocery store, I</b>

<b>buy one or two, sometimes three.</b>

<b>How long have you been, uh-- how long</b>

<b>have you been buying this magazine?</b>

<b>A couple years. Maybe even more.</b>

<b>Well, why didn't you tell me?</b>

<b>I was scared that</b>

<b>you'd think it was weird.</b>

<b>Well, yeah, it is weird. See?</b>

<b>No, it is. It's</b>

<b>really-- you know, it's weird.</b>

<b>See? You're my own best friend, and I</b>

<b>feel like I don't even know you.</b>

<b>I should have told you.</b>

<b>Now I'm afraid to ask</b>

<b>what else you've been hiding.</b>

<b>- Oh, Jesus. - Yeah.</b>

<b>- These are all</b>

<b>science magazines. - Yeah.</b>

<b>See, I try to figure out what the</b>

<b>articles are saying. I really try.</b>

<b>But, you know, maybe if I had to teach it</b>

<b>to explain it to me, you know?</b>

<b>- Release of the</b>

<b>excitatory-- - You know what?</b>

<b>- You're my transmitter. - You don't even</b>

<b>have to go back if you don't want to.</b>

<b>- Where? - The class.</b>

<b>You could even leave</b>

<b>before the end if you wanted to.</b>

<b>You really want me to go, huh?</b>

<b>I really-- I mean really, really.</b>

<b>Well, yeah, sort of weird,</b>

<b>but what time does it start?</b>

<b>Um, it's Monday. Monday, 5 o'clock. Okay.</b>

<b>Monday, we're walking.</b>

<b>I haven't tried harder than I've ever</b>

<b>seen anything in my life before, okay?</b>

<b>- You're old. - Okay?</b>

<b>- Dan alert. - What?</b>

<b>Hey, lock the door already.</b>

<b>Hello.</b>

<b>Open the door.</b>

<b>- Hey, what's up, little captain? - Hey.</b>

<b>- What are you doing?</b>

<b>- Playing game, boys.</b>

<b>- Playing that game by</b>

<b>all day again, huh? - Yep.</b>

<b>- Where's your mother? Is she home? - Um,</b>

<b>I beat your ass going to the game today.</b>

<b>- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.</b>

<b>The thing is, you're</b>

<b>playing all day like that.</b>

<b>Give me some more.</b>

<b>Here, here.</b>

<b>- Oh, but that, um... - What?</b>

<b>I love you.</b>

<b>- Oh, that's nice. I love you,</b>

<b>too, okay? - I and that. Look.</b>

<b>- Oh, jeez, I can't believe you got me</b>

<b>that shit. Okay. - No,</b>

<b>but you can't go in there.</b>

<b>- Why? - Uh, surprise.</b>

<b>- Yeah? What kind of</b>

<b>surprise? - A really good one.</b>

<b>Okay, well, I'm ready. Bring it on.</b>

<b>But it's not ready</b>

<b>yet, so you gotta wait.</b>

<b>Well, you know what? I guess it'll be</b>

<b>okay, so I'm just gonna be out.</b>

<b>But Dad, you're not</b>

<b>allowed to go in there.</b>

<b>What's going on?</b>

<b>What, is it my birthday or something?</b>

<b>I don't want to surprise you.</b>

<b>Let me just wash my hands.</b>

<b>Since when are you little</b>

<b>Miss Betty Crocker here?</b>

<b>Just today.</b>

<b>Not ready yet, though.</b>

<b>- Let me taste. - It's not ready.</b>

<b>I gotta put eggs in it.</b>

<b>I gotta put water in it.</b>

<b>It's not done yet, is it?</b>

<b>It's not bad, though.</b>

<b>- Hey, how was your</b>

<b>math test? - Got an A.</b>

<b>An A? Nice. And how</b>

<b>was basketball practice?</b>

<b>- Math's no good. - You</b>

<b>just keep at it, all right?</b>

<b>You never give up. That's all it takes.</b>

<b>Why not?</b>

<b>- What? - What we were talking about.</b>

<b>- Julie. - Just be asking.</b>

<b>I'm eating.</b>

<b>I want to know the reason.</b>

<b>Computers, son.</b>

<b>But I want to.</b>

<b>Why? What are you gonna</b>

<b>do? Start your own website?</b>

<b>Maybe.</b>

<b>I surf the internet. See?</b>

<b>Wait a second. Did I miss something here?</b>

<b>The bill gets called, I was gone.</b>

<b>You left the message saying you want to</b>

<b>come work at Microsoft</b>

<b>or something like that.</b>

<b>Why?</b>

<b>Because I said so, okay?</b>

<b>You know, we can't</b>

<b>afford it anyway, okay?</b>

<b>- We could charge it. - We're not gonna fucking touch the credit card.</b>

<b>Okay? Now stop.</b>

<b>Good.</b>

<b>Julie.</b>

<b>- Julie. - Yeah?</b>

<b>- Come back here. - Okay, one sec.</b>

<b>- Yeah? - Come on.</b>

<b>- What? - No hard feelings, okay?</b>

<b>- Come here. - What?</b>

<b>Come here. Come here.</b>

<b>- Come here. - What?</b>

<b>- Okay? - Yeah.</b>

<b>- Okay? - Hey, get a room.</b>

<b>- Come on. - Let's--</b>

<b>This is true love, okay?</b>

<b>It's a bit deal, guys. Just--</b>

<b>Welcome. Welcome to</b>

<b>Introduction to Computers.</b>

<b>A long time ago, when computers were</b>

<b>young and as huge as dinosaurs,</b>

<b>there existed a man named Lorenz.</b>

<b>He was a scientist, a</b>

<b>meteorologist at MIT,</b>

<b>and believed that computers</b>

<b>could predict the weather.</b>

<b>And I don't mean a quick five-day</b>

<b>shot-in-the-dark situation</b>

<b>you have on the 6 o'clock news where they</b>

<b>say, "Sunny and warm tomorrow,"</b>

<b>and then all of a</b>

<b>sudden you have a snowstorm.</b>

<b>I mean really predict the weather.</b>

<b>Excuse me. Are you in the second row</b>

<b>there? What's your name?</b>

<b>- Claire. - Claire.</b>

<b>We were about to have a break, Claire.</b>

<b>I wonder if you could put away the</b>

<b>newspaper until we have the break.</b>

<b>- I'll read and listen</b>

<b>at the same time. - Good.</b>

<b>So Lorenz used 12</b>

<b>variables in an equation</b>

<b>that he programmed into his computer to</b>

<b>try to make weather formulations.</b>

<b>And then one day, just to save time,</b>

<b>he reduced one of the</b>

<b>variables just by a small amount.</b>

<b>Just to save time, went off to have his</b>

<b>coffee, his morning coffee.</b>

<b>And when he came back</b>

<b>to his weather machine,</b>

<b>he found that his</b>

<b>shortcut had changed everything.</b>

<b>He saw from the printout, clearly, that</b>

<b>weather could never be predicted.</b>

<b>It was chaos.</b>

<b>Tiny things change everything.</b>

<b>Why, the flapping of butterflies' wings</b>

<b>could sometimes, maybe</b>

<b>other times not, produce</b>

<b>a change in air pressure that could</b>

<b>change the direction of the wind</b>

<b>that could bring on a storm.</b>

<b>In other words, if you go outside after</b>

<b>this class and whistle,</b>

<b>there's a tiny infinitesimal chance that</b>

<b>you could create a tornado</b>

<b>that would rip the roof off your house</b>

<b>and change your life forever.</b>

<b>So after this class, just do it.</b>

<b>Go outside and whistle.</b>

<b>And remember as you're doing it, how tiny</b>

<b>things can change everything.</b>

<b>Lights, please. We have some lights.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>Miss Tamaranda, I just wanted</b>

<b>to thank you for your class.</b>

<b>I loved it a lot. Well, thank you.</b>

<b>I mean, I've never loved anything as much</b>

<b>as I loved you, class.</b>

<b>Well, thank you very much.</b>

<b>Okay. Thanks.</b>

<b>I like to...</b>

<b>She...</b>

<b>Bye.</b>

<b>So, you're not going to tell</b>

<b>Mike about the class, right?</b>

<b>I already told them.</b>

<b>Oh, well, please tell</b>

<b>them not to tell Rick, okay?</b>

<b>I thought you told Rick.</b>

<b>I thought Rick said</b>

<b>yeah, and it was okay.</b>

<b>Oh, listen. When you get home,</b>

<b>please make sure you</b>

<b>tell Mike not to tell Rick.</b>

<b>So Mike's not going to be home anyway.</b>

<b>Again?</b>

<b>Yeah, you know, I guess</b>

<b>every couple has a rough patch,</b>

<b>and we have one big, long one that</b>

<b>started the day we got married, right?</b>

<b>It's good he's not home anymore,</b>

<b>'cause, you know, all</b>

<b>he's ever done when he's home</b>

<b>lately is just sit on</b>

<b>the couch and be swale.</b>

<b>You know, Rick watches a lot of TV, too.</b>

<b>Yeah. Well, Mike's stiffer</b>

<b>than TV, and then he snores.</b>

<b>Rick clicks his teeth. That's worse.</b>

<b>Oh, man. The other night, I thought I</b>

<b>heard a train coming.</b>

<b>It wasn't a train. It was him snoring.</b>

<b>It was so fucking loud.</b>

<b>Well, Rick has the end room.</b>

<b>Mike has pimples on his ass.</b>

<b>Rick forgets to brush his teeth.</b>

<b>Ew. Mike smells pretty bad.</b>

<b>He smells like a locker room.</b>

<b>Mike smells clean. He wears a broom.</b>

<b>Yeah, I like your own boots, all right.</b>

<b>But he yells a lot. I</b>

<b>mean, I say, "Can I do this?"</b>

<b>No. "Can I do that?" No.</b>

<b>Okay. See? He was very interested.</b>

<b>Okay. Thank you for coming.</b>

<b>We'll come talk to you tomorrow, okay?</b>

<b>Okay. All right.</b>

<b>Would you have a lever?</b>

<b>No, man. I would leave my own.</b>

<b>I was just making fun of him. You know,</b>

<b>it's the way I get it out.</b>

<b>Okay. Good night.</b>

<b>Please do not go to the locker room.</b>

<b>You have third period study hall today.</b>

<b>You must report to the gym.</b>

<b>Julie, what are you doing in here?</b>

<b>Okay. Here's what I was</b>

<b>thinking about, though.</b>

<b>Functions are like an oven.</b>

<b>And what you put in the</b>

<b>variables, you let it bake,</b>

<b>and then what comes out is something</b>

<b>different. Is that it?</b>

<b>One second.</b>

<b>How long have you been working at this?</b>

<b>Only about three</b>

<b>weeks. I love it, though.</b>

<b>Wait. Here it is.</b>

<b>Here it is. I wanted to show you this</b>

<b>gorgeous picture of fractal.</b>

<b>You've learned all</b>

<b>this in only three weeks?</b>

<b>Did you ever think</b>

<b>about going to college?</b>

<b>Me?</b>

<b>Well, sure.</b>

<b>There's a class here you could take,</b>

<b>help you pass the G.E.D.s, and then you</b>

<b>could apply for college.</b>

<b>Rick wouldn't go for it.</b>

<b>Do you always do what Rick says?</b>

<b>No!</b>

<b>What are you doing? Stop it!</b>

<b>No, Matty, don't!</b>

<b>I didn't tell him to come back in here!</b>

<b>It's helped you grow up, okay?</b>

<b>You're out of your mind, you know that?</b>

<b>I'm gonna teach you a</b>

<b>lesson this time, okay?</b>

<b>See, our life is</b>

<b>without me for a change, huh?</b>

<b>You're a freakin' lunatic!</b>

<b>Fuck!</b>

<b>You're responsible for</b>

<b>your fuckin' actions, okay?</b>

<b>So this is the end of it.</b>

<b>This is the end for me, okay?</b>

<b>You got it?</b>

<b>Shut up, Rick!</b>

<b>You know what? I'm teaching</b>

<b>you a fuckin' lesson, okay?</b>

<b>Lisa, Lisa!</b>

<b>You gotta make money to spend money, you.</b>

<b>You know what? You are</b>

<b>fuckin' done with me, Julie!</b>

<b>You know what? I'm</b>

<b>not bullshittin' around!</b>

<b>Stop it, dad! Come back here!</b>

<b>You gotta keep actin' out</b>

<b>like this bullshit, okay?</b>

<b>I'm done with putting up with your</b>

<b>bullshit, all right?</b>

<b>Everyone out there!</b>

<b>Stop it and take care of your kids!</b>

<b>That is it! I'm not</b>

<b>bullshittin' around, all right?</b>

<b>Okay, so go ahead and put your time!</b>

<b>Mom, that's a weird matter! You're crazy!</b>

<b>Fuckin'... You're... You're lying!</b>

<b>Stop it! Stop it!</b>

<b>Stop it!</b>

<b>I can't believe... I can't</b>

<b>believe you fucking did that!</b>

<b>It's better this way!</b>

<b>Right, Mom?</b>

<b>Hey! Oh, are you okay?</b>

<b>Yeah, yeah.</b>

<b>Were the kids okay?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Well, 'cause I heard</b>

<b>yellin' all down the street.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Your little neighborhood heard it.</b>

<b>You got a lot of stuff</b>

<b>out on your front lawn.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>You're not yourself, Julie.</b>

<b>I'm not myself.</b>

<b>What is that?</b>

<b>Julie!</b>

<b>Okay, so what are you doin'?</b>

<b>What does it look like?</b>

<b>I'm gonna go loop with Daddy.</b>

<b>You can't!</b>

<b>I can't!</b>

<b>But you don't know where he lives!</b>

<b>I'll find him!</b>

<b>Wait, is Daddy gonna live here no more?</b>

<b>She kicked him out! She threw all his</b>

<b>stuff out the window!</b>

<b>Julie?</b>

<b>He was making fun of me!</b>

<b>You shouldn't have</b>

<b>told him about your class!</b>

<b>Oh, you told him that class.</b>

<b>Yeah, I snapped. I don't know.</b>

<b>It was your own fault</b>

<b>he was making fun of you.</b>

<b>I... told him I was thinking about</b>

<b>getting my high school diploma,</b>

<b>and I thought maybe I could apply to</b>

<b>Jersey State College.</b>

<b>And, um, I've been thinking about this</b>

<b>and thinking about this, and--</b>

<b>And then Dad told her crazy woman she</b>

<b>kicked him out of the house!</b>

<b>So that's what I'm gonna do.</b>

<b>I'm gonna go to college.</b>

<b>I'm gonna be a computer scientist.</b>

<b>Ah, don't worry, Claire. I mean, we're</b>

<b>gonna-- we're gonna be fine.</b>

<b>We're not gonna starve. I'll get a job.</b>

<b>What kind of job are you gonna get?</b>

<b>Well, I-- I can-- I can do things. I</b>

<b>learned-- I can learn things.</b>

<b>Well, honestly, though,</b>

<b>what can you, like, do?</b>

<b>I mean, just-- I'm asking.</b>

<b>Um... how much is in this?</b>

<b>Um... what do you mean?</b>

<b>How much money is in</b>

<b>the checking account?</b>

<b>Your father didn't balance it yet.</b>

<b>So why don't you?</b>

<b>You know how to do this?</b>

<b>Don't you?</b>

<b>You don't know how to</b>

<b>balance a checkbook?</b>

<b>I... Claire doesn't either.</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>I knew it! You're fucking retards!</b>

<b>- Lisa! - Shut up!</b>

<b>- Why don't you mouth like this? - Well,</b>

<b>only retards don't know</b>

<b>how to balance a checkbook.</b>

<b>- Lisa? - Only retards of two kids,</b>

<b>and no job, and no way to get a job, and</b>

<b>then kick their</b>

<b>husbands out of the house.</b>

<b>You fucked it up, Mom! You just totally</b>

<b>fucked everything up!</b>

<b>You shouldn't talk to me</b>

<b>like that. No. I mean...</b>

<b>I guess just, like, leave</b>

<b>her alone for a while, right?</b>

<b>How am I gonna keep us alive? I don't</b>

<b>even know how to balance a checkbook.</b>

<b>- Mom? - What?</b>

<b>I know how.</b>

<b>Frankie, you're the best.</b>

<b>Yeah, but look, they</b>

<b>taught us in fifth grade.</b>

<b>You add up all these numbers here, and</b>

<b>then just subtract them by these ones.</b>

<b>- Look, right here. -</b>

<b>It's really easy, Claire.</b>

<b>- Yeah, it's easy. - Add and subtract.</b>

<b>- Yeah. - That's it.</b>

<b>- Yeah. - I feel really fucking stupid.</b>

<b>You're the best.</b>

<b>Mom, like, how are you gonna get a job?</b>

<b>You don't know how to do nothing.</b>

<b>(phone beeping)</b>

<b>Hi, I'm...</b>

<b>(sighs)</b>

<b>Okay. (phone beeping)</b>

<b>Eight.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Hello?</b>

<b>Hi, is this Clean Bright Clean Agency?</b>

<b>Hi, yeah, I'm calling about the ad and</b>

<b>the paper for the cleaning lady.</b>

<b>Yeah, what about it?</b>

<b>Yeah, hi.</b>

<b>Well, I've never cleaned professionally,</b>

<b>but I'm pretty good</b>

<b>at cleaning lampshades</b>

<b>and frames.</b>

<b>The only thing is you just gotta be</b>

<b>patient with my oven cleaning, because...</b>

<b>(phone beeping)</b>

<b>- Acme cleaning service.</b>

<b>Hi, I'm a cleaning lady. I'm very good.</b>

<b>Okay, may I have your name?</b>

<b>Uh, Julie.</b>

<b>And your last name?</b>

<b>Julie.</b>

<b>(phone beeping)</b>

<b>Johnson, Julie Johnson.</b>

<b>Arnie.</b>

<b>Julie, is that you?</b>

<b>Is Rick there?</b>

<b>I know he's there.</b>

<b>Arnie, tell him that he's got kids.</b>

<b>Kids, tell him he's got</b>

<b>bills to be paid, okay?</b>

<b>Tell him he's got kids.</b>

<b>(phone beeping)</b>

<b>Oh, man.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Um...</b>

<b>Is Claire back?</b>

<b>Oh, my God, where the hell is she?</b>

<b>(phone ringing)</b>

<b>I know, I'm sorry, I'm</b>

<b>sorry, Mike, I'm sorry.</b>

<b>Okay, look, I mean, just, can you just</b>

<b>tell her to come, just come right over,</b>

<b>tell her to come right</b>

<b>over, tell her not to,</b>

<b>tell her not to put anything</b>

<b>down, tell her to put her...</b>

<b>Hold on, goodbye, one second, yeah, bye.</b>

<b>Um, I'm standing by the</b>

<b>path, train rush hour.</b>

<b>You know, all those</b>

<b>yuppies rushing off the train.</b>

<b>Anyway, um, I said who</b>

<b>needs a cleaning lady,</b>

<b>five of them gave me the numbers.</b>

<b>Five yuppies in 40 minutes.</b>

<b>Mom, you gotta call him right now.</b>

<b>Okay, okay.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Oh, um, Mom, I need basketball sneakers</b>

<b>for practice tomorrow.</b>

<b>Okay, all right, we'll</b>

<b>get them in the morning.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Can I have some more Clips?</b>

<b>Eat your food, Lisa.</b>

<b>Not peanut butter.</b>

<b>I like peanut butter. Unbelievable. I mean, besides tasting retarded,</b>

<b>it's got all the nutrition of sawdust.</b>

<b>All this stuff Jupy calls peanut butter.</b>

<b>Lisa.</b>

<b>I bet there isn't even one</b>

<b>peanut in the whole gallon jar.</b>

<b>I bet there isn't even a shell.</b>

<b>It's full, Lisa.</b>

<b>No, it isn't.</b>

<b>Jupy manufactures this stuff as a plot to</b>

<b>stump poor kids' brains.</b>

<b>Why would they do that?</b>

<b>So that when they grow up,</b>

<b>they won't mind</b>

<b>working from an minimum wage.</b>

<b>Just to be honest, I'm not gonna be part of no Jupy plot.</b>

<b>I'm not gonna get my brain stunted.</b>

<b>Besides, I want to lose more weight.</b>

<b>You lost weight?</b>

<b>Two pounds. My friends are so jealous.</b>

<b>You're gonna gain it back, okay?</b>

<b>I don't want to gain it back.</b>

<b>Eat your food, Lisa.</b>

<b>Make me.</b>

<b>I'm telling you, eat your food, okay?</b>

<b>Try and make me.</b>

<b>Lisa?</b>

<b>See, you can't. Only Dad</b>

<b>can, and he's not here.</b>

<b>You're right. I'm telling you, eat your food, okay? He's not here.</b>

<b>You're right. He's not here.</b>

<b>Like, maybe he's not</b>

<b>ever gonna be here again,</b>

<b>which leaves me as the only</b>

<b>person who's gonna pay the bills</b>

<b>and make up the rules</b>

<b>and put food on the table,</b>

<b>even if you think that</b>

<b>food is stunting your brain.</b>

<b>-Julie? -Okay!</b>

<b>-I'm saying eat. -No, I'm trying to eat.</b>

<b>-Eat, Lisa. Eat. -Oh, oh.</b>

<b>Clem.</b>

<b>I left.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>I left.</b>

<b>Well, if you could kick</b>

<b>Rick out, I can leave.</b>

<b>So, uh, you inspired me. I left.</b>

<b>-You left? You-you're home? -Yeah.</b>

<b>Where are you gonna go?</b>

<b>I was just dead.</b>

<b>I've been sitting in the</b>

<b>whole book of the cinema all day.</b>

<b>I've been trying to figure it out.</b>

<b>Anyway, I don't know. I</b>

<b>don't know where I'm gonna go.</b>

<b>I figure all my other</b>

<b>friends are married,</b>

<b>and, you know, their</b>

<b>husbands live at home,</b>

<b>so maybe I could stay with you guys.</b>

<b>You're staying with us?</b>

<b>Well, yeah, if you love me,</b>

<b>I mean, I brought some stuff.</b>

<b>I brought, you know, this and this.</b>

<b>You got money?</b>

<b>Yeah. Good, 'cause</b>

<b>first thing in the morning,</b>

<b>we need charts and basketball shoes.</b>

<b>-You gonna let me stay? -Of course.</b>

<b>-Come on! -Oh, good.</b>

<b>-Come on in. -Okay.</b>

<b>-Get your stuff in. -Get out of here.</b>

<b>-Are you okay? -â™ª Here ends my life â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª High and mighty life â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª I got addicted to the pressure â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª The constant elevation â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª My true identity â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª Faded â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª Faded â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª I was tired â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª Of being persuaded â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª Heart in my heart â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª My heart is smiling â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª In the heart, heart in my heart â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª My heart is smiling â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª You know it's a lie â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª When they catch your eye â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª And tell you how great</b>

<b>it is that you made it â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª You made it â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª Never mind that â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª You're being downgraded â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª Continually â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª I only hope I live to see â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª The face of God's running over me â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª I only hope I live to see â™ª Claire.</b>

<b>You're supposed to be asleep.</b>

<b>I'm not sleeping either.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Then you're supposed to be asleep.</b>

<b>I won't sleep till I</b>

<b>take all my GED tests.</b>

<b>Hm, perfect.</b>

<b>No, come in.</b>

<b>Come on.</b>

<b>What if they fail him, Claire?</b>

<b>I mean, they only let</b>

<b>you take him three times.</b>

<b>Oh, you're gonna pass.</b>

<b>You know, what if you pass him?</b>

<b>Julie, you're gonna pass.</b>

<b>You gotta think positive.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>So go back to sleep, 'cause you don't</b>

<b>want to fall asleep in the middle of it.</b>

<b>I know.</b>

<b>So go to bed.</b>

<b>I don't want to sleep.</b>

<b>But you're gonna...</b>

<b>No, no, I don't wanna...</b>

<b>I don't wanna sleep either.</b>

<b>You want me to make you have chocolate?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>You want me to make you what?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>Sometimes I get these thoughts.</b>

<b>I can't get them out of my head.</b>

<b>Yeah, you thinking about Rick?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>About...</b>

<b>About what?</b>

<b>Wasn't that joke that Mr. Miranda told</b>

<b>about decimal points funny?</b>

<b>No, that joke.</b>

<b>I didn't think it was</b>

<b>funny. I didn't get that joke.</b>

<b>Oh, I thought it was funny. I got it.</b>

<b>Are you thinking about Mike?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>He was all, uh...</b>

<b>He was all blue.</b>

<b>What do you mean?</b>

<b>Oh, it was career day in</b>

<b>senior year in high school.</b>

<b>All the boys, they were gonna be cops.</b>

<b>We were sitting in a booth,</b>

<b>and they all painted blue.</b>

<b>That's why I saw him.</b>

<b>God, he was just so beautiful.</b>

<b>Beautiful.</b>

<b>They look like a statue.</b>

<b>What happened?</b>

<b>Yeah, I don't know what happened.</b>

<b>I don't know, yeah.</b>

<b>Claire, could I...</b>

<b>No, it's stupid.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>No, no, it's stupid.</b>

<b>All right.</b>

<b>But you mind if I sit next to you?</b>

<b>Yeah, yeah.</b>

<b>It just feels good, you</b>

<b>know, sitting next to someone.</b>

<b>Yeah, it does.</b>

<b>Can I sit closer?</b>

<b>Um...</b>

<b>Yeah. Okay, you can go to sleep.</b>

<b>I know, I hope so.</b>

<b>Just go to sleep.</b>

<b>(coughing)</b>

<b>It's been like this all morning.</b>

<b>Did you find it like this?</b>

<b>I'll call the system administrator.</b>

<b>Who?</b>

<b>Fred, the computer guy.</b>

<b>Oh, why don't we wait on that?</b>

<b>Hey, Mr. Miranda.</b>

<b>Oh, hi.</b>

<b>Hi.</b>

<b>Did you take the test?</b>

<b>I took it.</b>

<b>Uh-huh, and did you pass it?</b>

<b>I think I passed it.</b>

<b>You think you passed it?</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>The grammar.</b>

<b>The grammar. That grammar, yes.</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

<b>You'll call me tonight, you promise?</b>

<b>I will call you tonight,</b>

<b>and my fingers are crossed.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Hey, well, let me show you something in</b>

<b>the computer lab, can I?</b>

<b>Okay, sure.</b>

<b>Julie, come here.</b>

<b>I don't suppose you</b>

<b>know anything about this.</b>

<b>Um...</b>

<b>An encryption algorithm.</b>

<b>A what?</b>

<b>She just wrote an encryption algorithm.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Follow me.</b>

<b>Come on.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Do you want a Coke?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>Do you want some peanut butter cookies or</b>

<b>brought some home from the steakhouse?</b>

<b>I'm not thirsty, okay?</b>

<b>And I'm not hungry.</b>

<b>You're mad.</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>Yeah, you are. I can tell.</b>

<b>I thought you wanted</b>

<b>to go to Jose's house.</b>

<b>I thought going to Jose's house was your</b>

<b>favorite thing to do in the whole world.</b>

<b>I thought he was your best friend. I</b>

<b>thought you liked going over there.</b>

<b>Yeah, well, it's not.</b>

<b>Okay, well, look, I thought it was.</b>

<b>I mean, why do I have to go?</b>

<b>Why does Lisa have to go?</b>

<b>Hey, Mom needs a night off.</b>

<b>Why the fuck don't you go?</b>

<b>Watch your mouth.</b>

<b>Why the fucking shit don't you go?</b>

<b>Because I want to celebrate</b>

<b>with your mother, all right?</b>

<b>Well, then you don't know</b>

<b>she passed the English test.</b>

<b>Yeah, you know what I know.</b>

<b>Well, then Lisa and me should be</b>

<b>celebrating with her.</b>

<b>Why the fucking shit the hell gave you</b>

<b>the right to celebrate with her?</b>

<b>You need to watch your language. I'm</b>

<b>going to send you up to your room.</b>

<b>You do use language.</b>

<b>You know what? I don't anymore. Me and</b>

<b>your mom made a rule.</b>

<b>Well, when my mom's</b>

<b>here, although she says,</b>

<b>"Don't fucking do what you fucking say."</b>

<b>I mean, where the fuck are you?</b>

<b>Where the fucking shit are you? Jesus</b>

<b>fucking shit are you?</b>

<b>Jesus.</b>

<b>Where were you?</b>

<b>Oh, out with Chuck. Who's Chuck?</b>

<b>My boyfriend.</b>

<b>What happened to Victor?</b>

<b>Oh, he was talking to Susie Malnory in</b>

<b>front of the whole math</b>

<b>class making Google eyes.</b>

<b>Who needs him, you know?</b>

<b>I'm going to go get packed.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Frankie, how about tomorrow night?</b>

<b>I'll get out of here and you</b>

<b>can be along with your mother,</b>

<b>and you guys can celebrate together.</b>

<b>Whatever.</b>

<b>Can you solve this limit? Can you?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>Fuck. Here.</b>

<b>Use your algebra to solve that limit.</b>

<b>Okay. Okay.</b>

<b>Ah, correct, girl.</b>

<b>And?</b>

<b>Can you do this one?</b>

<b>Okay. Okay.</b>

<b>Very good.</b>

<b>Yeah?</b>

<b>Study it.</b>

<b>Why?</b>

<b>You need to know everything</b>

<b>in there to get into Stevens.</b>

<b>The science college. You</b>

<b>think I could get in there?</b>

<b>Absolutely. They have</b>

<b>a scholarship program.</b>

<b>They'd pay me the two to you. Chemistry,</b>

<b>physics, biology, calculus.</b>

<b>I really could get into Stevens.</b>

<b>You could get in anywhere you want. MIT,</b>

<b>whatever. Full scholarship.</b>

<b>You don't realize the capacity you have.</b>

<b>Here. Let's look at some of these.</b>

<b>Mr. Rand, are you like the</b>

<b>best teacher I've ever...</b>

<b>Um... Um... I just want</b>

<b>to... Can I ask you something?</b>

<b>It's, um... It's personal.</b>

<b>Yeah, sure.</b>

<b>I feel... I've never</b>

<b>felt this way about, um...</b>

<b>I'm explaining this.</b>

<b>I think I'm in love with this person, and</b>

<b>I'm in love with this person,</b>

<b>and I really got to</b>

<b>put it out of my mind.</b>

<b>I mean, I just got to</b>

<b>put it out of my mind,</b>

<b>and I should, but I can't,</b>

<b>and I don't know what to do.</b>

<b>I'm just... I... Yeah?</b>

<b>I think I know who you're talking about.</b>

<b>You do?</b>

<b>Yeah. And this person</b>

<b>likes you very much as well.</b>

<b>Is attracted to you, is</b>

<b>very attracted to you.</b>

<b>And sometimes feels in a mutual way.</b>

<b>But I must confess, I, um...</b>

<b>I once had a romance,</b>

<b>or an affair, I suppose.</b>

<b>I would have to call it an affair.</b>

<b>With a student, an adult</b>

<b>student, not unlike you.</b>

<b>And, um... I hurt the student very badly.</b>

<b>My wife... She, uh... She</b>

<b>still hasn't gotten over it.</b>

<b>I can't say that I've gotten over it.</b>

<b>In fact, every morning,</b>

<b>when I look in the mirror,</b>

<b>I can't stop asking myself.</b>

<b>Mr. Miranda?</b>

<b>Students just shouldn't</b>

<b>fall in love with teachers,</b>

<b>and the teacher shouldn't</b>

<b>fall in love with students.</b>

<b>It... It, uh... But it</b>

<b>does happen. Oh, it does.</b>

<b>The student's not really</b>

<b>in love with the teacher.</b>

<b>You have to understand.</b>

<b>They're in love with the subject matter.</b>

<b>They don't realize it.</b>

<b>Oh, of course, the teacher does often</b>

<b>seem larger than life.</b>

<b>I understand that.</b>

<b>But at home, I have to tell</b>

<b>you, when I'm not teaching,</b>

<b>I'm just a normal, boring guy.</b>

<b>Take it from me. I'm so</b>

<b>boring that I even bore myself.</b>

<b>Um... Do you think I'm in love with you?</b>

<b>You're, uh... You're not?</b>

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>Well, is that so unusual?</b>

<b>Yes. I'm sorry.</b>

<b>It's been known to happen.</b>

<b>Mr. Miranda?</b>

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>It's Claire. I'm in love with Claire.</b>

<b>Claire?</b>

<b>My friend Claire.</b>

<b>Oh. Right.</b>

<b>You're...</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>Disgusted. Not at all.</b>

<b>But it's...</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>Averted. What? I don't think so.</b>

<b>Everybody says it's...</b>

<b>No, I'm not... I'm not everybody.</b>

<b>Really? I mean, I've had many students</b>

<b>come to me over the years.</b>

<b>Many? Mm-hmm.</b>

<b>What are you selling?</b>

<b>Oh, I don't know.</b>

<b>Not much, I guess. I suppose I say...</b>

<b>Some people.</b>

<b>It's just the way they are.</b>

<b>Yeah, you know, there's this girl,</b>

<b>Charlene, in high school.</b>

<b>And, um, something written,</b>

<b>"Dike and the Lock and the Lock"</b>

<b>and everybody was just really mean to her</b>

<b>and calling her pervert</b>

<b>and they're like, "We're not gonna stop</b>

<b>till she stops being perverted."</b>

<b>And that day that that was on the locker,</b>

<b>everybody was laughing.</b>

<b>Were you? Were you laughing?</b>

<b>They let you stay here. And when you go</b>

<b>out, just close the</b>

<b>door. It'll lock behind you.</b>

<b>Where are you going?</b>

<b>You have some work to do.</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

<b>Hey, Mom, congratulations.</b>

<b>No, don't say that. I</b>

<b>think I flunked the English.</b>

<b>Come on, you always think you're so</b>

<b>stupid, but I know you're smart.</b>

<b>Bye.</b>

<b>Mwah. Bye.</b>

<b>Get drunk, get rowdy. You could use a</b>

<b>little rowdy-ness. You</b>

<b>know what I'm saying?</b>

<b>Don't I get a kiss, Frankie?</b>

<b>No. Frankie, don't be an ass face.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>-Claire? -Hey.</b>

<b>Hi. Did they call?</b>

<b>-No. -No.</b>

<b>What are we gonna do about Frankie?</b>

<b>Yeah. I don't know. We'll figure</b>

<b>something out, right?</b>

<b>We'll figure something out.</b>

<b>-Hey, do you think that's</b>

<b>that? -Oh, my. Oh, my gosh.</b>

<b>Hello?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Yeah?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>-Who was it? -Mr. Miranda.</b>

<b>-You didn't pass, right? -No.</b>

<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

<b>Oh, I did.</b>

<b>Man, this shit is hard. You</b>

<b>know, you can take it again.</b>

<b>No, I know. I passed.</b>

<b>You passed? You fucking passed?</b>

<b>Oh, my God! You fucking passed, sure!</b>

<b>Oh, you fucking passed.</b>

<b>Oh, my God. Look what I did.</b>

<b>Look what I made. Look what I did.</b>

<b>Oh, my God. What is this?</b>

<b>Um...</b>

<b>I thought we were just</b>

<b>gonna go have some spaghetti.</b>

<b>-You don't like it? -I do like it.</b>

<b>-This is-- It's beautiful. -Yeah.</b>

<b>-Yeah, it's beautiful. -Good, 'cause I</b>

<b>want it to be beautiful.</b>

<b>That is beautiful.</b>

<b>Good.</b>

<b>Well, 'cause, okay, even more than, uh,</b>

<b>than you pass than the G.E.D.,</b>

<b>I wanted to celebrate 'cause I got</b>

<b>something to tell you.</b>

<b>Really? 'Cause I got</b>

<b>something to tell you, too.</b>

<b>Yeah? Yeah.</b>

<b>-Okay, tell her. You go</b>

<b>first. -No, you go first.</b>

<b>No, I couldn't. I couldn't either.</b>

<b>-Hey, you wanna have some wine? -Yeah,</b>

<b>let's have some wine.</b>

<b>Mmm. Thank you, Joy.</b>

<b>God, it was awful in there today.</b>

<b>I was so busy.</b>

<b>There was one woman--</b>

<b>I swear to God I was</b>

<b>gonna take her bowl of chili,</b>

<b>I was gonna shove it in her face.</b>

<b>She didn't leave a tip.</b>

<b>She ran me back and forth,</b>

<b>and she didn't leave a tip.</b>

<b>[ Chuckles ]</b>

<b>[ Sighs ]</b>

<b>So, maybe we both have the same thing to tell?</b>

<b>Yeah, maybe. No, we don't. No way.</b>

<b>There's a chance?</b>

<b>Okay, well, maybe there is a chance.</b>

<b>I'm hoping on that chance.</b>

<b>Okay, maybe there's a chance.</b>

<b>Okay, I'll go first.</b>

<b>Okay, like, I don't miss Rick anymore,</b>

<b>and I'm not gonna be able to tell you. I don't miss Rick anymore, and...</b>

<b>I've been thinking about someone else.</b>

<b>Who?</b>

<b>Like, all the time. Like, every second.</b>

<b>Okay, who is it?</b>

<b>It's you.</b>

<b>Okay, but...</b>

<b>What's going on here?</b>

<b>Claire?</b>

<b>No, I mean, you were over my feet,</b>

<b>and you got something else on your mind?</b>

<b>No, no, forget -- forget</b>

<b>I said it, Claire, please.</b>

<b>So, wait, the whole time</b>

<b>I've been living in this house,</b>

<b>you have, like, dirty,</b>

<b>nasty thoughts about me?</b>

<b>I've been --</b>

<b>No, just forget I said it.</b>

<b>Please, forget it, please.</b>

<b>No, I'm not gonna forget you said it.</b>

<b>No, I thought you were my friends.</b>

<b>I am your friend.</b>

<b>You liked me for me.</b>

<b>I do like you for you.</b>

<b>I can't believe you did this.</b>

<b>I just --</b>

<b>I can't believe it.</b>

<b>I mean, we were having so much fun.</b>

<b>Jesus!</b>

<b>Fuck!</b>

<b>Ugh. Ugh.</b>

<b>Claire?</b>

<b>Claire, can you hear me?</b>

<b>Claire, I want to -- I</b>

<b>want to say something.</b>

<b>Can you do something to let</b>

<b>me know that you can hear me?</b>

<b>Please don't be mad, Claire.</b>

<b>Please don't move out. Please don't move out.</b>

<b>I don't know how you could, you know,</b>

<b>say something like that to me</b>

<b>or expect me to know what to say.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>I do like you for you, okay?</b>

<b>I mean, that's the whole point.</b>

<b>But -- but please don't move out,</b>

<b>because we'll just -- we'll forget the</b>

<b>whole thing ever happened.</b>

<b>It's gone. Never happened.</b>

<b>Can I tell you what I</b>

<b>was gonna tell you before?</b>

<b>Sure.</b>

<b>Well, I was gonna tell you that, um,</b>

<b>I'm gonna quit my job at the steakhouse.</b>

<b>And I'm gonna start</b>

<b>sitting into Mr. Miranda's class,</b>

<b>and I'm gonna try and pass it to E.T.</b>

<b>And then I want to study to be a cop.</b>

<b>I mean, if Mike and Rick can be cops, I</b>

<b>don't see why I can't.</b>

<b>Does that bother you?</b>

<b>No. Why would it bother me?</b>

<b>I don't know, 'cause Rick's a cop.</b>

<b>No, it doesn't bother me.</b>

<b>Have you ever been with a woman?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>Have you ever thought about it?</b>

<b>Until?</b>

<b>I thought about it.</b>

<b>Really?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>I thought about it in high school.</b>

<b>On and off.</b>

<b>And I thought about it</b>

<b>in junior high school.</b>

<b>All and off.</b>

<b>I thought about you.</b>

<b>Why did you say something?</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>It's wrong.</b>

<b>You know, it's perverted, and it's wrong,</b>

<b>and it's dirty, and it's</b>

<b>perverted, and it's wrong.</b>

<b>You know, you get these thoughts, you</b>

<b>gotta get 'em out of your head.</b>

<b>We gotta get out of our heads.</b>

<b>Julie.</b>

<b>Hi.</b>

<b>I'm sorry. I'm late.</b>

<b>That's okay.</b>

<b>I had three tables full of kids.</b>

<b>Hi, guys.</b>

<b>- Good luck, man.</b>

<b>Long time.</b>

<b>- Yeah, well this one keeps me going.</b>

<b>- But, it's just like Grand Fucking</b>

<b>Central around here.</b>

<b>- I'm gonna get it later.</b>

<b>- Min, Min, Min!</b>

<b>- Fucking want a cigarette?</b>

<b>- Can I have one?</b>

<b>- No, I'm not gonna have one.</b>

<b>(sighs)</b>

<b>- I wish we could have some privacy.</b>

<b>- Yeah, yeah.</b>

<b>I, uh, I thought about you today.</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>- Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - All day. - I guess I am.</b>

<b>I guess I thought about you too.</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>- Couldn't stop.</b>

<b>(baby crying)</b>

<b>- I wanna hold your hand.</b>

<b>- Yeah, it's a fuck.</b>

<b>- I know.</b>

<b>- It's a fucking man. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.</b>

<b>- It's a fucking Macy's is what it is.</b>

<b>- Fuck, I want a cigarette.</b>

<b>I'm not gonna have one.</b>

<b>I don't wanna taste like an ashtray.</b>

<b>- You didn't taste like an ashtray.</b>

<b>- Yeah, it did.</b>

<b>- No, you didn't.</b>

<b>No, you tasted like Sprite</b>

<b>with, um, like a little charcoal.</b>

<b>- Sick.</b>

<b>- I love the way you tasted.</b>

<b>- I wanna hold to your hand.</b>

<b>- But it's a park.</b>

<b>- I know.</b>

<b>- If we were home.</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>I'm thinking about it.</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>- Stop.</b>

<b>- Nobody can stop us from being here.</b>

<b>- I'm thinking about it.</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>- You're not doing anything.</b>

<b>- We were a mess last night.</b>

<b>Like a disaster, right?</b>

<b>- But then, when I touched</b>

<b>your face, do you remember?</b>

<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

<b>- I touch your face now, in my mind.</b>

<b>- Can you feel it?</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>- Can you feel it?</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>- Don't think.</b>

<b>- Okay.</b>

<b>I'm touching your hair.</b>

<b>I'm touching your neck.</b>

<b>I'm touching your mouth.</b>

<b>Your mouth.</b>

<b>It's soft.</b>

<b>- You're soft.</b>

<b>- All over.</b>

<b>- I can remember.</b>

<b>- I kiss you all over.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>- I'm kissing you back.</b>

<b>- I'm kissing you all over.</b>

<b>- Okay. - I kiss you all over.</b>

<b>- You smell like roses.</b>

<b>- You smell good.</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>Tell me.</b>

<b>- You smell good.</b>

<b>Like baby powder.</b>

<b>I never knew there could be so much.</b>

<b>- It's so cold.</b>

<b>- It's cold.</b>

<b>- It's cold.</b>

<b>- It is cold.</b>

<b>- Let's go.</b>

<b>[music]</b>

<b>[music]</b>

<b>[music]</b>

<b>- Hey, Sally.</b>

<b>- Hey, Chloe.</b>

<b>- How are you doing?</b>

<b>- Good.</b>

<b>Good.</b>

<b>- How are you doing?</b>

<b>- I have chicken wings.</b>

<b>- I'll smell it.</b>

<b>- I haven't seen you in so long, right?</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>How are you doing?</b>

<b>- So, you want to ask her to come?</b>

<b>- Oh, yeah.</b>

<b>You know, we're going to go</b>

<b>to the mall at Parama's after.</b>

<b>We'll just look at earrings</b>

<b>and I don't know, hang out.</b>

<b>- Have coffee, you know?</b>

<b>- Coffee?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>Do you want to come?</b>

<b>- No, I don't need earrings.</b>

<b>- Yeah, yeah, I heard you.</b>

<b>- You know, just last night I was hanging</b>

<b>out with Mike and Rick,</b>

<b>and I was like, "Oh, that's really hurt."</b>

<b>- We're just trying to improve our lives.</b>

<b>- Oh, yeah?</b>

<b>You know, most people</b>

<b>just join a gym for that.</b>

<b>She's a bitch.</b>

<b>These puzzle pieces look like fractals.</b>

<b>A fractal isn't a puzzle.</b>

<b>- What is a fractal?</b>

<b>- Okay, here it is.</b>

<b>The simplest geometric object</b>

<b>that could be called a fractal</b>

<b>is a cantoscent, okay?</b>

<b>What you've got is you've</b>

<b>got a line, you trisect it,</b>

<b>you remove the middle</b>

<b>third, you've got two lines,</b>

<b>and you keep doing this on and on,</b>

<b>and what you have is you</b>

<b>have an infinite number</b>

<b>of infinitely small</b>

<b>points that are always arranged</b>

<b>in the same pattern.</b>

<b>- Cool.</b>

<b>How's the studying going, Claire?</b>

<b>- I'm doing an equation.</b>

<b>It's really hard.</b>

<b>- Test it, number two.</b>

<b>Tell us all about yourself.</b>

<b>- Well, my name is Mary Jo Novak,</b>

<b>and I'm originally from</b>

<b>Walla Walla Watch and--</b>

<b>- Wait a second there, Mary Jo.</b>

<b>Walla what?</b>

<b>- Walla Walla Watch and Rick--</b>

<b>- Mary Jo, how can I explain this to you?</b>

<b>No one-- - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - What's the cleanest to you?</b>

<b>No one is from Walla</b>

<b>Walla Watch and Rick--</b>

<b>- Well, I beg to differ, Rick.</b>

<b>I am from Walla Walla.</b>

<b>- I have never met--</b>

<b>tectonic plates were shifting at an</b>

<b>extremely rapid rate.</b>

<b>In fact, as we look at</b>

<b>the evolution of the planet</b>

<b>from around 8,000 BCE</b>

<b>until the present day,</b>

<b>we see that the amount of</b>

<b>change that has taken place</b>

<b>over the last 2,000 years</b>

<b>is equal to all the changes</b>

<b>up until that point in</b>

<b>the planet's lifespan.</b>

<b>North America and Asia have shifted</b>

<b>further apart recently</b>

<b>at an incredible rate.</b>

<b>In fact, at this rate,</b>

<b>there could be a land bridge</b>

<b>between the eastern</b>

<b>seaboard of North America.</b>

<b>(indistinct chatter)</b>

<b>- Lucky fun!</b>

<b>(indistinct chatter)</b>

<b>- Notice how the smoke</b>

<b>flows smoothly off the end</b>

<b>of the cigarette.</b>

<b>Right about here, it breaks</b>

<b>into a kind of wild turbulence.</b>

<b>Like a river flowing down a mountain,</b>

<b>the way it breaks into rapids.</b>

<b>Rapids?</b>

<b>Can we see the slide?</b>

<b>Good.</b>

<b>Now, it's very difficult for</b>

<b>physicists to study turbulence</b>

<b>because like weather, it has no rules.</b>

<b>It's--the motion ever repeats itself.</b>

<b>It's chaotic.</b>

<b>Now, our friend, Lorentz,</b>

<b>he was able to reduce the</b>

<b>turbulence of boiling water</b>

<b>to three very simple variables,</b>

<b>which he was able to</b>

<b>chart and trace over time.</b>

<b>Now, this is chaos here.</b>

<b>There's a picture of it.</b>

<b>It doesn't look like chaos, does it?</b>

<b>Or maybe the look of chaos has a pattern.</b>

<b>- I'm home!</b>

<b>Claire?</b>

<b>Claire?</b>

<b>Claire?</b>

<b>He's campy.</b>

<b>Help me.</b>

<b>Claire?</b>

<b>- Claire, I found a way to explain</b>

<b>what I was talking about last night.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>The mountain is stable.</b>

<b>The falling sand is not.</b>

<b>At one point, the edge of</b>

<b>the mountain is gonna fall,</b>

<b>and when and how,</b>

<b>that's what chaos is, edges.</b>

<b>- I missed my friends.</b>

<b>- I'm--I'm your friend?</b>

<b>- I know.</b>

<b>I--yeah, I used to have more than one.</b>

<b>- We'll get new friends.</b>

<b>- What do you mean we'll get new friends?</b>

<b>I've had these friends for my whole life.</b>

<b>- Okay, I got an idea, okay?</b>

<b>- People from Manhattan make me nervous.</b>

<b>- It's okay.</b>

<b>Once you get there, you'll be fine.</b>

<b>â™ª 'Cause it's sitting on my body â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª It's on a tip of buttons â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª They're looking around â™ª</b>

<b>- Tommy has been talking about you.</b>

<b>- Yeah? - Mm-hmm.</b>

<b>- And it is so nice to see another woman</b>

<b>in this boys' club.</b>

<b>- It's a police group. - Oh, sure.</b>

<b>They can't help themselves.</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>You're gonna introduce her?</b>

<b>- Yeah, this is my friend Claire.</b>

<b>- I am Claire. - Hi, Claire. Welcome.</b>

<b>- This is my key. -</b>

<b>Glad to have you with us.</b>

<b>- Hey, Tommy, your friends are here.</b>

<b>- Oh, oh, you made it good.</b>

<b>- Mr. Miranda? - Please</b>

<b>call me Tom, all right?</b>

<b>I have a surprise for your treat.</b>

<b>Come on in here. I</b>

<b>want you to meet someone.</b>

<b>- Okay.</b>

<b>- Tommy!</b>

<b>- Robert Sander.</b>

<b>I want you to meet Julie</b>

<b>Johnson, Claire Devaney.</b>

<b>Robert studies</b>

<b>bifurcations and plain-out,</b>

<b>Diffie-O, help me out here, Bob.</b>

<b>- Special admissions, Princeton.</b>

<b>- Call him Bob, please.</b>

<b>- Very nice to meet</b>

<b>you. - Nice to meet you.</b>

<b>- Hi, Bob. - Hello.</b>

<b>- Do you want some</b>

<b>drink? - I would love that.</b>

<b>Yeah, that would be really good.</b>

<b>- Oh, I saw Rogues</b>

<b>and Cashmere years ago.</b>

<b>I was safe to travel there.</b>

<b>- The carpet just needs a major redo.</b>

<b>- So you're not happy with Iraq?</b>

<b>- I think Persian, maybe.</b>

<b>- What about the pad?</b>

<b>- A little casual, but the Feynman</b>

<b>diagrams never go down.</b>

<b>- Well, for instance, only proof is not</b>

<b>only could the onset of turbulence</b>

<b>be mathematically formulated by the use</b>

<b>of nonlinear equations,</b>

<b>but they also showed that</b>

<b>turbulence was directly related</b>

<b>to a sensitive</b>

<b>dependence on initial conditions</b>

<b>and that the turbulence was</b>

<b>described by strange tractors.</b>

<b>- Oh, right. I do. I think I remember.</b>

<b>- Right.</b>

<b>- I bet you have.</b>

<b>- I bet you have.</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>- Hello. How are you? Good to see you.</b>

<b>- Good.</b>

<b>- So good to see you.</b>

<b>- Thank you. Yes. I feel great. Yes.</b>

<b>- You didn't talk to</b>

<b>anybody. You got to talk to people.</b>

<b>- I tried to talk to people.</b>

<b>- I don't know. She's sat</b>

<b>alone most of the night.</b>

<b>- They wouldn't talk to</b>

<b>me. I tried really hard.</b>

<b>- All right.</b>

<b>- Fuck. It's Susan.</b>

<b>- Jesus. Fuck.</b>

<b>- Susan.</b>

<b>- What?</b>

<b>- It's fucking Susan.</b>

<b>She can fucking see us.</b>

<b>- What's there to see?</b>

<b>- She can fucking see</b>

<b>us. She's not stupid.</b>

<b>It's written all over us.</b>

<b>- What?</b>

<b>- Just get the fuck away from me.</b>

<b>- I'm not even there yet.</b>

<b>- Just get the fuck</b>

<b>away from me, all right?</b>

<b>Just leave me the fuck alone.</b>

<b>- There's nothing to see. She's--</b>

<b>- She can fucking tell.</b>

<b>- She's stopped. She's</b>

<b>looking straight ahead of her.</b>

<b>- She's pulling away.</b>

<b>- She can fucking tell.</b>

<b>- Claire.</b>

<b>[sighs]</b>

<b>[clanging]</b>

<b>- Yes.</b>

<b>Yes, that's absolutely correct.</b>

<b>Very good.</b>

<b>Have a seat.</b>

<b>You know, I'm a big</b>

<b>admirer of Tom Miranda.</b>

<b>He's very impressed with you.</b>

<b>And I think quickly solving a few</b>

<b>multi-task equations</b>

<b>is very impressive.</b>

<b>But I don't know if</b>

<b>that makes you a genius.</b>

<b>You know, people who make real</b>

<b>contributions to mathematics</b>

<b>are usually young and always under 30.</b>

<b>- You're a little over the hill.</b>

<b>- I don't know if we know</b>

<b>yet what I'm capable of.</b>

<b>- Hey, where are you going?</b>

<b>- Pat, who's Joe?</b>

<b>- Who's Joe?</b>

<b>- My boyfriend.</b>

<b>Oh, Mom, you've got to see Claire.</b>

<b>She looks beautiful.</b>

<b>â™ª A photograph â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª I don't want no photograph â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª All I want is a photograph â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª I want to touch you â™ª</b>

<b>- Shit.</b>

<b>Two minds.</b>

<b>- What?</b>

<b>I gotta be there 20 minutes.</b>

<b>- Where?</b>

<b>- I'm going to Sally's.</b>

<b>- You were gonna study tonight.</b>

<b>- Okay, well, you know what?</b>

<b>I haven't been invited</b>

<b>over there in a long time,</b>

<b>and so I changed my minds.</b>

<b>- You gotta study, Claire.</b>

<b>- Yeah, not tonight I don't.</b>

<b>- You're not gonna pass the GED test.</b>

<b>- Okay, that test isn't for two and a</b>

<b>half more weeks, right?</b>

<b>- You have a lot to learn.</b>

<b>How do you expect to pass the test?</b>

<b>- Julie, I'm gonna go over to Sally's.</b>

<b>I'm gonna go and I'm gonna</b>

<b>hang out with my friends.</b>

<b>- You bored of me?</b>

<b>- No.</b>

<b>- Then why'd you stay at home?</b>

<b>- Because I'm really</b>

<b>sick of staying at home.</b>

<b>- You bored of me?</b>

<b>- Look, normal people do not stay home</b>

<b>every single night of</b>

<b>their lives, all right?</b>

<b>Normal people go out and</b>

<b>they party with their friends.</b>

<b>- We're not normal.</b>

<b>- Okay, I don't know about you, right?</b>

<b>But I'm normal.</b>

<b>- What do you mean by that?</b>

<b>- It means I want to have fun.</b>

<b>It means I want to have</b>

<b>fun with normal people.</b>

<b>Normal fun with normal people.</b>

<b>And if I have to stay in</b>

<b>this house one more night,</b>

<b>I talk about phase</b>

<b>transitions and fractals.</b>

<b>I am gonna fucking go out of my mind.</b>

<b>- Oh, and what are you gonna</b>

<b>talk about with your friends?</b>

<b>The same things you talk about with me?</b>

<b>Who's having an</b>

<b>affair with who hairstyles?</b>

<b>Maybe sometimes I go</b>

<b>out of my mind with you.</b>

<b>Sometimes maybe I think you're stupid.</b>

<b>- Okay, you are not</b>

<b>better than other people,</b>

<b>Julie Johnson.</b>

<b>You are not.</b>

<b>You can sit around and</b>

<b>you can spout your shit</b>

<b>about fractals and chaos</b>

<b>theory and iterated recursion.</b>

<b>What the fuck, Abba?</b>

<b>But you are not better than me.</b>

<b>- Oh, Jesus.</b>

<b>- What are you doing?</b>

<b>- You want to be with your friends?</b>

<b>Be with your friends.</b>

<b>- You can't go.</b>

<b>- Why?</b>

<b>- 'Cause you weren't invited.</b>

<b>- Well, of course you were me.</b>

<b>They wouldn't even know a thing.</b>

<b>- Julie.</b>

<b>- I won't even look at you.</b>

<b>- Roommate, okay?</b>

<b>You can't go.</b>

<b>- They're my friends too, Claire.</b>

<b>- Not anymore.</b>

<b>No one knows you anymore, Julie.</b>

<b>I don't even know you anymore.</b>

<b>- Okay, but first, can</b>

<b>I show you something?</b>

<b>- I gotta go.</b>

<b>- No, first, let me,</b>

<b>listen, Claire, listen.</b>

<b>Let me show you something, okay?</b>

<b>You're not gonna like it</b>

<b>in the beginning, okay?</b>

<b>But if you can keep</b>

<b>your temper from blowing,</b>

<b>I think when I've got</b>

<b>the whole thing explained,</b>

<b>I think you're gonna maybe like it a lot,</b>

<b>like I think you're gonna like it.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Okay, so...</b>

<b>So next year, hopefully</b>

<b>I'll be going to Stevens.</b>

<b>You'll be going to Jersey City College</b>

<b>or wherever you want.</b>

<b>- Look, I need to go</b>

<b>see my friends, okay?</b>

<b>- Okay, but we get new friends.</b>

<b>We get New York City friends, okay?</b>

<b>That's part of it.</b>

<b>Listen, just listen, please, Claire.</b>

<b>Okay, I made this chart because</b>

<b>I was thinking, well, you always say</b>

<b>you'd make a great lawyer, and it's true.</b>

<b>You got great arguing skills.</b>

<b>So I got to thinking, is it possible?</b>

<b>Is it possible we go to college together?</b>

<b>So here it is.</b>

<b>Here.</b>

<b>So you go to classes three nights a week,</b>

<b>and you study the other</b>

<b>two nights and on Saturday,</b>

<b>and then weekend nights and Sunday,</b>

<b>we have it off and we</b>

<b>spend with the kids.</b>

<b>Okay, and then I've divided up the chores</b>

<b>between Frank and Lisa and us</b>

<b>because they've got to</b>

<b>help with the chores.</b>

<b>And then over here, I figured out</b>

<b>how we're going to pay for this.</b>

<b>I've got the grant</b>

<b>and loan possibilities.</b>

<b>I've got information for</b>

<b>you about Columbia and NYU</b>

<b>because Mr. Miranda said they</b>

<b>have great pre-law programs.</b>

<b>I mean, it's tight financially.</b>

<b>I admit it's tight, but I</b>

<b>think we can make it work.</b>

<b>I--</b>

<b>[soft music]</b>

<b>[music fades]</b>

<b>Mom, something's wrong with Frankie.</b>

<b>He was setting trash on fire at the park.</b>

<b>It's true, I know it.</b>

<b>Kay Smith doesn't live with perverts.</b>

<b>We're not perverts.</b>

<b>You still holding hands down by the dock.</b>

<b>Kerry Smith is the stupidest idiot I've</b>

<b>ever knew in my life.</b>

<b>Shut up, Lisa. I don't care.</b>

<b>We wouldn't hold hands.</b>

<b>Are you guys dykes?</b>

<b>No. No, of course not.</b>

<b>Well, I believe you.</b>

<b>Think you guys are dykes.</b>

<b>We are not dykes.</b>

<b>I'm gonna go live with Dad.</b>

<b>Frankie.</b>

<b>Kerry Smith is the stupidest</b>

<b>idiot I ever knew in my life.</b>

<b>[footsteps]</b>

<b>Claire, we're not.</b>

<b>No one's ever gonna</b>

<b>call me that again, so--</b>

<b>Claire, we're not.</b>

<b>No one's ever gonna</b>

<b>call me that again, right?</b>

<b>[footsteps]</b>

<b>[door creaks]</b>

<b>[door closes]</b>

<b>[footsteps]</b>

<b>Is it true?</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>You and Claire.</b>

<b>[sniffles]</b>

<b>We love each other.</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

<b>That's true.</b>

<b>In what way?</b>

<b>Love is--</b>

<b>Shit.</b>

<b>I shouldn't have told you.</b>

<b>No, you should have.</b>

<b>Do you want a hug?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>I just want to sit.</b>

<b>Do you wanna--</b>

<b>I just want to sit.</b>

<b>[soft guitar music]</b>

<b>Where they have the last ones, right?</b>

<b>And this is where we--</b>

<b>Let me get a very cold one.</b>

<b>I'm gonna--</b>

<b>Bear--</b>

<b>Oh, Julie.</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

<b>The moment I see Claire, it's emergency.</b>

<b>Um--</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>[chuckles]</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>[soft guitar music]</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>[footsteps]</b>

<b>Claire?</b>

<b>I saw it.</b>

<b>I'm going to bed.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>I'm tired.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Um--</b>

<b>You and me, it, um--</b>

<b>It's--</b>

<b>It's, uh, not the same</b>

<b>between you and Mike, is it?</b>

<b>It's none of your business.</b>

<b>You know?</b>

<b>What did I do with my time?</b>

<b>What did I do with my time?</b>

<b>What did I do with my future?</b>

<b>It's just-- It's not any business, Julie.</b>

<b>I'm going to bed.</b>

<b>[footsteps]</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>Keep moving around.</b>

<b>Pass the ball around.</b>

<b>That's right.</b>

<b>That's right.</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>I'm going.</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>Frankie!</b>

<b>Frankie!</b>

<b>So that's the dike.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>Is that your dike model?</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>That's the dike, isn't it?</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>Hey, shorty, come on.</b>

<b>Back up.</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>No white for here.</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>[whistle]</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>When's she starting?</b>

<b>I thought we were waiting for Claire.</b>

<b>Starting?</b>

<b>She'll be down.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>You coming to dinner, Claire?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>I fixed you a plate.</b>

<b>No, I'm not coming.</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

<b>How's Frankie?</b>

<b>He's okay.</b>

<b>How you doing?</b>

<b>I'm okay.</b>

<b>Yeah?</b>

<b>Long time, huh?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>What are you drinking?</b>

<b>I'm just having a little drink.</b>

<b>How about I take you out</b>

<b>and get you a good bottle?</b>

<b>[chatter]</b>

<b>Yes, you know, I've been</b>

<b>doing a lot of thinking, you know,</b>

<b>where I'm figuring out how to be a better</b>

<b>man and everything like that.</b>

<b>Really?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>I've been doing some work, you know?</b>

<b>And like, you know, I</b>

<b>got to treat you better.</b>

<b>I know that now, right?</b>

<b>I got to take you out, you</b>

<b>know, and I got to listen more.</b>

<b>Right.</b>

<b>You know, I don't know</b>

<b>if you know this or not,</b>

<b>but I was real torn up about you.</b>

<b>I didn't know.</b>

<b>I mean, real torn up.</b>

<b>I started seeing a shrink.</b>

<b>Don't tell nobody.</b>

<b>Don't tell nobody, right?</b>

<b>But I mean, this guy, he was on the job</b>

<b>before he started shrinking heads,</b>

<b>so he knows a thing or two.</b>

<b>And he said we could go</b>

<b>see him together, you know,</b>

<b>and work out our</b>

<b>problems, be a family again.</b>

<b>You would like that?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>This is good wine, right?</b>

<b>It's better than when</b>

<b>I was drinking today.</b>

<b>Yeah, none more of</b>

<b>that garbage for you, huh?</b>

<b>It's good though, huh?</b>

<b>So Frankie's not</b>

<b>sleeping so good, you know?</b>

<b>I had a little talk with him,</b>

<b>and Frankie, Frankie</b>

<b>thinks you're a lesbian.</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>Yeah, I should know, right?</b>

<b>Stupid rumor.</b>

<b>Yeah, but you know, that's</b>

<b>why I told Frankie, you know?</b>

<b>I mean, people talk.</b>

<b>They say stupid things.</b>

<b>Yeah, I told him you just can't listen to</b>

<b>that shit, you know?</b>

<b>There's three conditions to chaos.</b>

<b>The first is that it's a</b>

<b>sensitive to initial conditions.</b>

<b>The second is that</b>

<b>it's periodically dense.</b>

<b>And the third is dense transitive.</b>

<b>You know, you lost me there, sweetie.</b>

<b>How can I show you a</b>

<b>computer-generated image?</b>

<b>You know, it's all right.</b>

<b>I don't really care for that</b>

<b>kind of talk anyway, you know?</b>

<b>It's a nice night though, huh?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Beautiful.</b>

<b>It's like you.</b>

<b>Okay, so...</b>

<b>So maybe I could come in</b>

<b>for a little bit, you know?</b>

<b>Not tonight.</b>

<b>No?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>Sooner, right?</b>

<b>Hopefully.</b>

<b>Yeah, hopefully so.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Mm.</b>

<b>Mm.</b>

<b>Sorry.</b>

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>Yeah, I got carried away there.</b>

<b>Smell good.</b>

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>About what?</b>

<b>I loved being with you tonight.</b>

<b>I loved it.</b>

<b>And I want to go to</b>

<b>the shrink with the kids,</b>

<b>'cause I want to know how to deal with</b>

<b>them better, you know?</b>

<b>Yeah, so we'll bring the kids.</b>

<b>But we can't be the kind of family that</b>

<b>you're talking about.</b>

<b>Well, why not?</b>

<b>I can't.</b>

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>I'm sorry, babe.</b>

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>I'm sorry. - Full of ten international delight</b>

<b>flavors. - But no coffee.</b>

<b>She was a suspicious record.</b>

<b>What kind of coffee guy are you?</b>

<b>The best kind.</b>

<b>The kind who can take</b>

<b>your tired ordinary coffee</b>

<b>and make it rich, premium, delicious</b>

<b>beyond your wildest dreams.</b>

<b>Really?</b>

<b>It's time.</b>

<b>Julie, you are flying so far away.</b>

<b>You know, you're flying</b>

<b>into the O Zone or something.</b>

<b>I don't know. I don't want to know.</b>

<b>But it's too far away for me.</b>

<b>I just want to sit back here on the Earth</b>

<b>and wave at you and watch you go.</b>

<b>Don't you want to make</b>

<b>something of yourself?</b>

<b>You know, like be somebody?</b>

<b>Julie, I already am somebody.</b>

<b>We come sit closer.</b>

<b>You want me to sit closer?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>What are you doing here?</b>

<b>I'm waiting for you.</b>

<b>Do you want to go to the</b>

<b>Museum of Natural History?</b>

<b>They got the butterfly exhibit up.</b>

<b>And, you know, I want to</b>

<b>sit in on that lecture,</b>

<b>Columbia, on the celestial taxonomy,</b>

<b>Friday at seven. Do you want to go?</b>

<b>Do you want to go?</b>

<b>What is it? What's wrong?</b>

<b>She's gone.</b>

<b>Here, it's all right.</b>

<b>Do you want to talk about it?</b>

<b>I want you to sign me.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>I want to measure the</b>

<b>distance from here to Alpha Centauri.</b>

<b>Why?</b>

<b>I gotta know.</b>

<b>I gotta know.</b>

<b>There was a time I know you like me.</b>

<b>We saw</b>

<b>Everyone's burnt.</b>

<b>Everything's gone.</b>
