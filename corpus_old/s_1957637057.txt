[glass shattering]

IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

AH, DAMN IT.
[woman shrieks]

JESUS CHRIST, YOUâ€™LL DO ANYTHING
FOR THAT KID.

WHAT ABOUT ME?

WALT, WALT.

I AM SORRY.

I WONâ€™T DO IT AGAIN.

I WONâ€™T HURT YOU.

Iâ€™M SORRY.

AARON.

LORD, SON.

YOU LIKE TO GIVE ME
A HEART SPELL

STANDING THERE IN THE DARK.

YOU OKAY, MAMA?

HUSH, CHILD.
YOUâ€™LL WAKE YOUR FATHER.

NOW, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BACK EARLY?

I--I FORGOT...
I JUST...

NOW, YOU TAKE
YOUR DADDYâ€™S TRUCK ON

BEFORE HE HAS A MIND TO.

YOU HEAR ME?

GO ON.

DAMN, AARON.

FOR A MAN WITH
A RIDE LIKE THIS,

YOUR DAD SURE DOES DRINK
SOME WINO SHIT.

GIVE ME SOME OF THAT.

OH, MAN.

TAKE THE PAINT RIGHT OFF A CAR.

DO YOU WANT A SIP, AARON?

COME ON, BUD,
YOU GOT TO LOOSEN UP.

PUT THAT PENCIL DOWN
ONCE IN A WHILE.

[gun cocks]

HEY, MAN.

DAMN, WHAT ARE YOU DOINâ€™, MAN?

PUT THAT THING AWAY.

WANT MR. PERKINS TO THINK
AARON WAS FUCKINâ€™ WITH HIS SHIT?

[sighs]

OH, MY GOODNESS.
IS THAT TAMMY?

LOOK AT THIS, BOYS.

DONâ€™T DO IT, SHANE.

[screaming]

[laughing]
SHANE!

STOP IT, SHANE.
THATâ€™S NOT FUNNY!

Iâ€™M NOT IMPRESSED.

SOMEBODY COULDâ€™VE GOT HURT.

OH, WELL, I WASNâ€™T
TRYING TO IMPRESS YOU.

I WAS TRYING TO SCARE
THE SHIT OUT OF YOU.

DAMN, DEB, IF Iâ€™D HAVE
KNOWN YOUR HEAD
WAS SUCH A FIRE HAZARD,

I MIGHT NOT HAVE
TAKEN THE CHANCE.

[laughs]

[laughing]
HEY, TAMMY.

HI, SHANE.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

OH, WELL...

WHY DONâ€™T Y'ALL PULL OFF UP HERE
AND TAKE A LITTLE SIP?

I WOULD...

I HAVE TO TAKE DEBORAH
OVER TO THE PIT STOP

TO MEET JASON.

BUT CARRIE GETS OFF
AT 11:00 TONIGHT, DANNY.

OKAY, THANKS.

BYE, YOU GUYS.

BYE, SHANE.

SEE YOU.

WHOO-HOO.
MAN.

Yâ€™ALL SAW THAT, RIGHT?
Yâ€™ALL SAW THAT?

I TOLD YOU.

I HATE TO BURST
YOUR BUBBLE, SHANE,

BUT THE GIRLâ€™S GOT
BARRY JACOBSONâ€™S JERSEY NUMBER

TATTOOED ACROSS HER CHEST.

MAN, COME ON.
MY NUMBER WAS CLOSE ENOUGH.

SHE COULD JUST GET
THAT LEFT TIT "3"

CHANGED TO AN "8,"
AND WEâ€™LL BE IN BUSINESS.

YOU BEEN HASSLINâ€™ THAT CHICK
EVER SINCE YOU LEFT SCHOOL.

NOW, I KNOW YOUâ€™VE SEEN GREENER
PASTURES THAN JEFFERSON HIGH.

FIRST OF ALL, I AINâ€™T BEEN
A HASSLE TO NOBODY

SINCE I WAS IN DIAPERS,
ALL RIGHT?

SECOND OF ALL,
JUST â€™CAUSE YOU CAN'T REMEMBER

WHAT A GIRL LOOKS LIKE NAKED
DONâ€™T MEAN YOU GOT TO
TAKE IT OUT ON ME, ALL RIGHT?

OH, SHIT.

YO, BETTER THAT
THAN WHAT YOU BEEN HAULINâ€™ IN.

YOU EVER GET THAT LAST ONE
ON A SCALE, SHANE?

â€™CAUSE LOOKED LIKE SHE
MIGHTâ€™VE BEEN A STATE RECORD.

OHHH.
SHE WAS KIND OF FAT, MAN.

OH, ALL RIGHT.
ALL THIS COMING FROM A MAN

WHO LIVES
WITH HIS UNCLEâ€™S BOYFRIEND.

Iâ€™LL TELL YOU WHAT;
I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED

A LITTLE STIFF
OUT THERE TONIGHT.

AT LEAST I WAS OUT THERE.

SHANE, Iâ€™M SORRY, MAN.

FUCK IT, MAN.
AINâ€™T NO THING.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

THATâ€™S JIM'S CAR.

â™ª WELL, Iâ€™M DOING
MY COWBOY BEST â™ª

AARON, GIVE ME
THAT HAY TWINE IN BACK.

HEY, BOY, HOW YOU DOINâ€™?
GET OUT.

SHANE, STOP!

I TOLD YOU, MAN.
I TOLD YOU. I TRIED
TO TELL YOU NOW.

NOW, LISTEN, IF YOU AINâ€™T
GONNA MARRY MY SISTER,

THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS
GET A HOTEL ROOM, SON.

JUST BE COOL.

GET HIS OTHER ARM.
AARON, HURRY UP.

YOUâ€™RE GONNA LEARN, JIM.
WE GONNA PUT YOU UP THERE.

IF YOU HURT HIM,
Iâ€™LL KILL YOU.

GET HIS LEGS, BOY.

Iâ€™LL KILL YOU!
DONâ€™T HURT HIM!

PULL YOUR SKIRT DOWN,
CHRISTINE.

DAMN IT, SHANE,
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

CHRISTINE,
YOU BETTER GO HOME, GIRL.

YOUâ€™RE HURTING HIM.
KNOCK IT OFF.

DAMN YOU, SHANE!
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

Iâ€™VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR MOUTH,
CHRISTINE. GO HOME!

SHANE!
DANNY, DONâ€™T!

SORRY, CHRISSY,
HEâ€™S GOT IT COMIN'.

HEY, JIM,
DIDNâ€™T YOUR MAMA TEACH YOU

TO WEAR CLEAN UNDERWEAR
FOR AN OCCASION LIKE THIS?

THATâ€™S GOOD ENOUGH.
LET HIM FALL OFF.

YOU LIKE BARBECUE, JIM?
HUH?

SHANE! SHANE, NO!

THANKS.

HEY, CARRIE.


ANYTHING NEW?

OH.
WAKE UP, BOY.

UH, SHANE?

HEY, LATER ON, FELLAS.

DROP HIM OFF AT HIS MOMâ€™S PLACE,
LIKE YOU FOUND HIM.

ALL RIGHT.

NIGHT, JIM!

WHEREâ€™S YOUR FAT BOSS?

I KILLED HIM.

YOU KNOW THAT JIMâ€™S GONNA GO
STRAIGHT TO THE POLICE,

AND Iâ€™M GONNA HAVE TO HEAR IT
FROM EMERSON AGAIN.

DONâ€™T WORRY.

JIMâ€™S 30 YEARS OLD,
AND SHANEâ€™S SISTER'S ONLY 15.

IN THIS STATE,
THEYâ€™D LOCK HIM UP

WAY BEFORE THEY DID ME.

HEY, I GRABBED HALF A CASE
OF BEER FROM THE RESTAURANT.

MM...YOU ARE A PEACH.

ITâ€™S IN THE BACK.

THIS IS A GREAT SONG.

YEAH, I THINK
HEâ€™S FROM AROUND HERE.

WARREN HAYNES?
YEAH.

YEAH, I WENT TO SEE HIM
IN ATLANTA, REMEMBER?

OH, THATâ€™S RIGHT.

HE PLAYS WITH
THE ALLMAN BROTHERS SOME.

NOT BAD FOR A CAROLINA BOY.

DANNY...
YEAH?

I LIKE WHERE WE ARE.

[laughs]
CEDAR BLUFF?

NO.
ITâ€™S PRETTY.

NOT CEDAR BLUFF.

I MEAN, YES, I LIKE THIS PLACE.

BUT I LIKE WHERE WE ARE.

TOGETHER.

[sighs]

YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT MARS HILL ANY?

CARRIE, MARS HILLâ€™S
REALLY SMALL.

IF I GET AN OFFER FROM WESTERN,

I COULD SIGN WITH A DIVISION ONE
SCHOOL AFTER TWO YEARS.

MARS HILLâ€™S A GOOD SCHOOL.

AND ITâ€™S ONLY 20 MINUTES AWAY.

YOU COULD WORK FOR MY DAD
OVER THE SUMMER.

YOU THINK TOO FAR AHEAD OF
THE HERE AND NOW; YOU KNOW THAT?

NOW, ME,

I WAKE UP HUNGRY,
I EAT.

GAME COMES ON,
I TURN ON THE TV.

I DONâ€™T WANT TO LOSE
THE HERE AND NOW.

I WANT TO GET AWAY,
I GO FISHING.

I WANT TO SEE YOUR BOOBS...

MMM, AND YOUâ€™RE
SIX MONTHS OLD AGAIN.


[brakes squeaking]

â™ª WAYFARING STRANGER

â™ª TRAVELING THROUGH
THIS WORLD OF WOE â™ª

â™ª BUT THEREâ€™S NO SICKNESS â™ª

â™ª OR TOIL OR DANGER

â™ª IN THAT BRIGHT WORLD

â™ª Iâ€™M GOING THERE

[flies buzzing]

GOOD MORNING, MR. SHEPHERD.

WELL, YOUâ€™RE ENTITLED
TO YOUR OPINION, MR. CROW.


[bluesy piano music playing]

â™ª

DID I BREAK IN
HERE LAST NIGHT?

CARRIE BROUGHT YOU OVER...

AGAIN.

SHE DIDNâ€™T WANT YOU
WANDERING AROUND

WHILE HER BROTHER WAS ON DUTY.

IF YOU WERE STILL
LIVING UNDER MY ROOF,

Iâ€™D HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
ABOUT YOUR PRESENT CONDITION.

YEAH, WELL,
I EXPECT YOU WILL ANYWAY.

UGH!

DAMN, CROW, WHAT THE HELL IS
THAT STUFF?

A CAR COULD RUN ON IT.

[chuckles]
ITâ€™S AN OLD BUG JUICE REMEDY.

YOU NEED TO WATCH
THAT DRINKING

IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR WIN.

PROSPECT CANâ€™T BE LIVING LIKE
NO NAMBY-PAMBY HELLION.

YOU DONâ€™T SEE GIL
DOINâ€™ THAT SHIT, DO YOU?

WHEREâ€™D YOU GET A WORD LIKE
"NAMBY-PAMBY," ANYWAY?

[chuckles]
"NAMBY-PAMBY," "UNMANLY,"

YOUR DAD
USED TO SAY "SISSIFY."

DONâ€™T MATTER WHERE IT COME FROM,
AS LONG AS YOU AINâ€™T IT.

WELL, I AINâ€™T.

GOOD TO HEAR.

[groans]

CAN I GET A RIDE INTO TOWN?


[siren wails]



[indistinct radio transmission]

YOUâ€™RE NOT GONNA PUKE
IN MY CAR, ARE YOU?

DONâ€™T WORRY.
I GOT NOTHINâ€™ LEFT.

MY SISTER GET IN OKAY
LAST NIGHT?

I GUESS.

WERENâ€™T YOU WITH HER?
YEAH...

YOU KNOW, I THINK SHE MAY HAVE
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ME.

I SURE AS HELL WILL,

IF I CATCH YOU TWO
DRINKING ON MY SHIFT.

WELL, GET IN, Iâ€™M LOSING
ALL MY AIR CONDITIONING.

MAN, PROMISE YOUâ€™RE GONNA
CLEAN YOURSELF UP

BEFORE YOU COME BY TONIGHT, HUH?

OKAY.

[dog barking]

[whispering]
LET ME SEE WHAT THAT IS.

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW?
OH, ITâ€™S ALREADY INFECTED.

COME ON.
FINISH FEEDING HIM.

YOUâ€™RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
TO DO THIS.

MAN, YOU GOT SOME KING-SIZED
JEWELS ON YOU, JIMBO.

KING-SIZE.

CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING
FOR THE CHAFING?

OH, STOP.
HUH?

[bluegrass music]

[rooster crowing]

WE GOT...

WE GOT ONE STRETCH LEFT,
MR. TAYLOR.

OKAY...

THEREâ€™S A BIT OF ROAST BEEF
AND GRAVY LEFT INSIDE.

GET A TASTE
AND THEN FINISH UP.

Iâ€™VE GOT TO GET
SOME MORE WIRE.

I NEED TO GET MY PAY
BEFORE YOU LEAVE, SIR.

WE DO, RIGHT?

WELL, Iâ€™LL SEND YOURS
BY JACK CROW.

THATâ€™S WHAT YOU SAID
LAST SATURDAY, SIR.

ARE YOU CALLINâ€™
MY WORD, SON?

SIR, I JUST EXPECT
WHAT WAS AGREED TO ME,

NOT MY UNCLE.

WELL, YOU FINISH
THAT LAST RUN,

AND THEN WEâ€™LL TALK.
NO, SIR.

LOOK, THEREâ€™S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

ITâ€™S BEEN TWO WEEKS.

Iâ€™M DUE WHAT'S OWED,
AT LEAST FOR LAST WEEK.

A SIMPLE CONTRACT.

CONTRACT?
YEAH.

LISTEN.
LISTEN!

YOU WORK FOR ME;
I PAY YOU.

AND THAT MEANS I PAY YOU
WHEN I GET READY.

LOOK, I NEED MY MONEY NOW.

I NEED TO GET PAID RIGHT NOW.

YOU KEEP YOUR GLOVES, ALL RIGHT?

SHOW SOME RESPECT AROUND HERE.

YOU JUST SHOW SOME RESPECT.

YOU MEAN BIG DON DIAMOND
THE WRESTLER?

TWO-TIME WWF WORLD CHAMPION
AND ALLEGED CROSS-DRESSER.


I TOLD BARRY AND HIS BOYS
I THOUGHT DIAMONDâ€™S GAY.

[chuckling] OH, NO.
IS HE?

YEAH, MAN, I DONâ€™T KNOW.

BUT YOU KNOW
I NEVER MISS A CHANCE

TO ABUSE
BARRYâ€™S CHILDHOOD HERO.

AND AARON TOOK OFF?

NOT BEFORE THEY BUSTED UP
HIS DADâ€™S TRUCK.

WHERE YOU GOINâ€™?

HUNTINâ€™.
WHERE?

AH, DONâ€™T DO IT, WALT.

WHERE ARE YOU GOINâ€™?

HUNTINâ€™.

NO, YOUâ€™RE NOT.
YOUâ€™RE GONNA FIX
THAT DAMN WINDOW.

ITâ€™S THE LAST TIME
YOUâ€™RE TAKING THAT TRUCK OUT.

Yâ€™ALL HAVE A GOOD TIME
LAST NIGHT?

I GUESS YOU
THEIR NEW WATER BOY.

IDIOT.

WELL, PETER,
HE LOOKS AT THOSE TWO LINES

LEADING UP TO
THE PEARLY GATES.

NO...WAIT...

HE LOOKS AT THE ONE
ON THE LEFT--

NO, NOT NOW.
THE SHORT ONE.

AND, UM...
DAMN.

DAMNED IF I DIDNâ€™T FORGET
THE ENDING.

TEN CENTS OR LESS,
NO CREDIT.

[laughs]

YEAH.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

ANYWAY, IT WAS A HOOT.

YOU GIVE NOTICE
AT MARS HILL YET, DANNY?

UM, NO.
NO, SIR, NOT OFFICIALLY.

HEâ€™S--HE'S WAITING
TO HEAR FROM WESTERN.

I DIDNâ€™T KNOW WESTERN
WAS INTERESTED.

THATâ€™S GREAT, DANNY.

YEAH...YEAH,
THEYâ€™RE COMING DOWN THIS WEEK.

WESTERN. NOW, THATâ€™S TAKING
IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL.

THATâ€™S A LONG WAY
FROM JEFFERSON CREEK,

ISNâ€™T IT, DANNY?

YES, MAâ€™AM.

WELL, GOOD LUCK.

EITHER WAY, YOU CAN COME
AND WORK FOR ME

AT THE MEAT HOUSE THIS SUMMER.

ALL THE PORK BELLY YOU CAN EAT.

FEELINâ€™ BETTER?

YOU LOOK IT.

I WAS...

TILL THAT THIRD HELPING
OF BAKED BEANS.

THATâ€™S JUST THE WAY MY FAMILY
SHOWS THEIR AFFECTION.

THEY SHOVEL IT ON YOUR PLATE.

EACH YEAR,
THEIR UNCONDITIONAL LOVE

PUTS ME
IN A BRAND-NEW PAIR OF PANTS.

YOU BETTER WATCH IT, THOUGH,
ELWAY.

YEAH.

HEY, YOU KNOW CARRIEâ€™S CRAZY
ABOUT YOU, MAN?

I KNOW.

BEYOND ME WHY.

GUESS YOU GOT YOUR MARKS.

COURSE, KIDNAPPING AND ASSAULT
WONâ€™T HELP YOUR STANDING ANY.

YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT IT.
YOU CANâ€™T DRIVE AROUND TOWN

WITH A MANâ€™S ASS
FOR A HOOD ORNAMENT

AND NOT EXPECT
PEOPLE TO NOTICE.

COME ON, EMERSON.
WE WERE JUST PLAYING AROUND.

YOU CANâ€™T DO
THAT SHIT, DANNY.

I KNOW JIMâ€™S NOT
GONNA PRESS CHARGES,

BUT LEGALLY, HE COULD.
SHANEâ€™S A LOOSE CANNON.

TAZ IS JUST AS BAD.
YOU GOT TO STEP IN SOMETIMES.

YOU THINK CARRIEâ€™S UPSET
YOUâ€™RE GOING OFF TO WESTERN?

TRY CRAGGY PENITENTIARY.

SHANE DID.

[phone ringing]

Iâ€™D HAVE PAID GOOD MONEY
TO SEEN IT, THOUGH.

JIMâ€™S GONNA BE PICKIN' JUNE BUGS
OUT OF HIS BUTT FOR A WEEK, MAN.


HONEY, ITâ€™S THE STATION
ON THE TELEPHONE.

JUST A SEC.

[screen door creaks]

DOMESTIC OUT ON ROSEMARY.
SOMEBODYâ€™S ALREADY ON SCENE.

YOU WANT ONE?
NO.

NOW, WHEREâ€™D YOU SAY THAT WAS?

ROSEMARY 315.
WHY?

MAMA?

YOU DONâ€™T UNDERSTAND.
HE GETS CONFUSED EASY.

YOUâ€™RE HURT, MAMA.
Iâ€™M FINE.

I JUST TOOK A FALL.

I HAD AN ACCIDENT, BABY,
AND NOW I GOT TO GO GET FIXED.

WHYâ€™D YOU GET HURT, MAMA?

WHERE?

I HIT THE PORCH STAIRS
OUT BACK,

CLUMSY AS I AM.

Iâ€™M GONNA BE ALL RIGHT, THOUGH.
THEYâ€™RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME.

YOUR MOTHER BROKE HER ARM,
AARON.

WE HAVE TO TAKE HER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.

STAY HERE.

DADDYâ€™LL BRING YOU OUT SOON.

HEâ€™S COMING OUT SOON.

GO ON.

IF WE WILL FOLLOW
THOSE COMMANDMENTS,

WE WILL RECEIVE THE GUARANTEE
OF LIFE EVERLASTING

AND LIFE ETERNAL.

"BUT IF YE, THROUGH THE SPIRIT,

"DO MORTIFY
THE DEEDS OF THE BODY,

"YE SHALL LIVE.

"FOR AS MANY AS ARE LED
BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD,

"THEY ARE THE SONS OF GOD.

"THE SPIRIT ITSELF BEARETH
WITNESS WITH OUR SPIRIT,

"THAT WE ARE
THE CHILDREN OF GOD.

"AND IF CHILDREN,
THEN HEIRS,

HEIRS OF GOD,
AND JOINT-HEIRS..."

YOU GET THAT WINDOW FIXED?

YES, SIR.

MR. SIMMONS,
JUST LIKE YOU SAID,

DIDNâ€™T CHARGE NOTHING
FOR THE GLASS.

YOU GONNA GO SEE MAMA?

MAY RISE UP IN THE LAST DAY,
MAY RISE UP...

WHY DONâ€™T YOU COME OVER HERE
AND SIT DOWN, AARON.

COME ON, BOY.
HAVE A SEAT.

YOU KNOW,
EVERY TIME I SAY YOUR NAME,

I THINK OF
YOUR DAMN JEW UNCLE.

THE MAN OWNS TWO CAR LOTS
AND HALF A STOCK CAR TEAM

AND HIS KIDS ARE STILL
ALL FUCKED UP.

HIS WIFEâ€™S GETTIN' IT
EVERY WEEKEND

FROM SOME IDIOT
DOWN AT THE LOCAL VIDEO STORE.

I DONâ€™T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT...

IT ALL GOES BACK TO YOUR MAMA
NOT WANTING TO LISTEN.

SEE, BEFORE YOU WERE BORN,
I TOLD HER, I SAYS,

"I DONâ€™T CARE WHAT YOUR FAMILY
TAKES FOR THE GOSPEL.

"WEâ€™VE GOT TO GIVE OUR SON
A NAME FROM THE GOOD BOOK.

"OTHERWISE,
HE COULD TURN OUT INFIRM...

OR WORSE."

SO WHEN YOU CAME OUT

AND YOU WERE NO BIGGER
THAN A LITTLE BABY PUP,

I SAT IN THAT HOSPITAL
FOR FIVE WEEKS,

WAITING FOR YOU TO BREATHE
ON YOUR OWN,

WONDERING WHY THE GOOD LORD
EVEN BOTHERED SENDING YOU.

LOOK AT ME, BOY.

COME ON, LOOK AT ME.

NOW, IF I WAS EVER GONNA
LOSE RELIGION, IT WAS THEN.

BUT I DIDNâ€™T.

I WENT BACK TO THE SCRIPTURE,
AND I LEARNED.

I LEARNED THAT HIS WILL
WORKS THROUGH ME.

SO WHEN YOUR MAMA
QUESTIONS MY WORD,

SHEâ€™S QUESTIONING
THE WORD OF GOD.

SEE, I BROUGHT YOU
INTO THIS WORLD,

AND I ALLOWED YOU
TO STAY HERE,

EVEN THOUGH
I THOUGHT DIFFERENT.

AND I WANT YOU
TO REMEMBER THAT.

IF YOU EVER THINK
TO TELL PEOPLE

ABOUT THE GOOD CHRISTIAN WAYS
OF THIS HOUSEHOLD...


DONâ€™T YOU CRY HERE, BOY.
Iâ€™LL HAVE NONE OF THAT.

YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM
IF YOUâ€™RE GONNA CRY.

I THINK
WE SHOULD GO SEE MAMA.

WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
MATTHEW 15:4.

TO LOVE THE LORD,
JESUS CHRIST,

IN OUR VERY HEART,
IN OUR VERY MIND,

OUR VERY SOUL,
TO THE DEPTHS OF OUR SOUL.

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, ON A...

"...JESUS SCRIBES
AND PHARISEES

"WHICH WERE OF JERUSALEM
SAYING,

"WHY DO THY DISCIPLES
TRANSGRESS THE TRADITIONS

"OF THE ELDERS?

"FOR THEY WASH NOT
THEIR HANDS

"WHEN THEY EAT BREAD,

"BUT HE ANSWERED AND SAID
UNTO THEM,

"WHY DO YOU ALSO TRANSGRESS
THE COMMANDMENT OF GOD

"BY YOUR TRADITION?

"GOD COMMANDED, SAYING
HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER

"AND HE THAT CURSETH FATHER
OR MOTHER

LET HIM DIE THE DEATH."

IF YOU WILL TURN TO
THE EIGHTH CHAPTER

OF THE BOOK OF ROMANS
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT

WHERE THE APOSTLE PAUL SHARES
SOME VERY INTERESTING INSIGHTS

AND THOUGHTS ABOUT
OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.

HE SAYS, IF GOD BE FOR US,
WHO CAN BE AGAINST US?

HE THAT SPARED NOT
HIS OWN SON

BUT DELIVERED HIM UP
FOR US ALL,

HOW SHALL HE NOT WITH HIM
ALSO FREELY GIVE US ALL THINGS?

WHO SHALL SEPARATE US
FROM THE LAW OF CHRIST?

[knocking]
AARON!

AARON!

IN ALL THINGS,
WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS...

MR. PERKINS?

[suspenseful music]

â™ª

OH, GOD.

SHOOT, MAN.

HEY, AARON.
AARON.

LETâ€™S WALK OUTSIDE, BUD.

THIS IS CRAZY.
WEâ€™RE STANDIN' OUT HERE

AND WALTERâ€™S IN THERE
BLED OUT LIKE A FUCKINâ€™
TROPHY BUCK.

WHAT ARE WE
TALKINâ€™ ABOUT?

LETâ€™S CALL THE POLICE.
NO. NO POLICE, NOT YET.

HEâ€™S RIGHT, MAN.
WE GOTTA...

THIS AINâ€™T GONNA
COME CLEAN, ALL RIGHT?

WE GOT TO LEAVE IT TO
GOD AND THE LAW NOW.

HIS MAMAâ€™S SPENDIN'
THE NIGHT IN THE HOSPITAL

â€™CAUSE WALTER SNAPPED HER ARM
LIKE A PIECE OF FIREWOOD.

YOU THINK GOD IS
WITHIN 100 MILES OF
JEFFERSON CREEK TONIGHT?

ALL I KNOW, THEREâ€™S A MAN
IN THERE IN FRONT OF
THE GODDAMN TV SET,

AND HIS CONDITION AINâ€™T
NEAR AS GOOD AS ELLIEâ€™S
OVER AT COUNTY MED.

OKAY. ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

YOU KNOW I HATED
THAT MEAN OLD FUCKER.

WHAT AARON DID, WALT PROBABLY
HAD IT COMINâ€™, MAN.

SHIT, WE CANâ€™T...

AT THIS POINT, WE GOTTA
LET SOMEBODY ELSE DECIDE.

[Aaron blubbering
wordlessly]

AARON, WHATâ€™S WRONG?
TALK TO ME. WHATâ€™S WRONG?

ITâ€™S TOO QUIET. THE MOSQUITOES
WONâ€™T STOP BUZZIN' AROUND.

ITâ€™S THE GUNSHOT
RINGINâ€™ IN HIS EARS.

AARON, LISTEN. LISTEN!
[continues blubbering]

AARON, STOP IT!
STOP IT, HEAR MY VOICE.

THAT SOUND WILL GO AWAY.
I PROMISE.

YOU HEAR THAT?
LISTEN.

SH. YOU HEAR THAT
OUT THERE?

THATâ€™S ABOUT AS LOUD AS
THE WORLD GETS AT NIGHT.

YOU JUST NEVER
NOTICED IT.

ITâ€™S AWFUL DAMN LOUD.
YEAH. YEAH, IT IS.

YOU JUST SIT DOWN HERE
AND LISTEN TO OUT THERE.

OKAY? LETâ€™S SEE HOW MANY
DIFFERENT SOUNDS YOU CAN HEAR.

YOU SAY LET THE LAW DECIDE?

WHAT DO YOU THINKâ€™S
GONNA HAPPEN TO AARON

WHEN HE WALKS IN
THAT COURTROOM?

THE KIDâ€™S GOT
HALF A BRAIN TO BEGIN WITH.

LOOK AT HIM NOW.

SHANE, YOU DID TIME
IN CRAGGY.

HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
HEâ€™LL LAST?

FROM THE LOVE OF GOD,

WHICH IS IN CHRIST JESUS,
OUR LORD,

IT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

THE HOLY WORD OF GOD
WILL LEAD YOU TO SALVATION

AND LIFE EVERLASTING...

[sighs]

AARON, STAY IN THE TRUCK.

ALL RIGHT,
WHATâ€™S DEAD IS DEAD.

JUST TELL YOURSELVES,

"AINâ€™T NO DIFFERENT
THAN ANY OTHER ANIMAL."

COME ON.

ALL RIGHT, GET HIS OTHER ARM.

GOD, HEâ€™S SOAKED.

ALL RIGHT, LETâ€™S GO.

READY, GO.


OVER HERE.

HERE.

COME ON, HURRY UP, GO.

[owl hooting]

YOU DONâ€™T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU DID.

WHY WEâ€™RE OUT HERE
ON THIS COLD-ASS LAKE.

YOU KNOW WHAT THEYâ€™D DO TO YOU
IF THEY EVER FOUND OUT?

PROBABLY FIX YOU TO NORMAL.

[water splashes]

THIS HERE IS A PROPERTY LINE.
[gun cocks]

YOUâ€™RE ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF
ON MY SIDE.

WEâ€™S JUST HIKIN' THROUGH.

HEADING BACK
TOWARDS SPOOKâ€™S BRANCH.

SPOOKâ€™S BRANCH IS
A GOOD THREE MILES FROM HERE.

YEAH?

SHIT, AARON, HEâ€™S RIGHT.
WE BETTER HEAD ON.

AINâ€™T YOU
WALTER PERKINSâ€™ BOY?

YEAH.

THATâ€™S FUNNY.
SEE, THING OF IT IS,

HE AINâ€™T BACK BEFORE LONG,
HIS DADâ€™S GONNA KILL HIM.

SO WE BETTER HEAD ON.

[gun cocks]

[sighs]

SIT DOWN THERE, PLEASE,
MR. TAYLOR.

ALL RIGHT,
WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

SOMEBODYâ€™S GOT TO WATCH HIM.

I DONâ€™T KNOW WHAT YOU BOYS
IS UP TO, AND I DONâ€™T CARE.

Yâ€™ALL GO ON YOUR WAY,
AND Iâ€™LL MIND MY OWN BUSINESS.

TAKE THE GUN WITH YOU.
TAKE ANYTHING HERE,
BUT JUST GO--

OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

PLEASE.
OKAY?

Iâ€™M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO BE QUIET FOR A SECOND.

CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

CAN YOU?
YEAH.

OKAY. I DONâ€™T MEAN
ANY DISRESPECT, ALL RIGHT?

[sighs heavily]

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS,
OKAY?

YOU STAY HERE AND WATCH HIM.

I WANT MY SAY TOO.

[sighs]

OKAY, HERE WE GO.
HERE.

NOW...

HEY, Iâ€™LL STAY--
JUST GIVE ME YOUR HANDS, OKAY?

Iâ€™LL STAY RIGHT HERE...
LISTEN, HEY, SHUT UP!

[whispering indistinctly]

SHANE, UH...
I DONâ€™T KNOW.

LOOK.
REAL CAREFUL SO FAR.

AND ITâ€™S GONNA BE REAL CAREFUL,
AND IT COVERS OUR ASSES.

ALL RIGHT, NOW OPEN YOUR MOUTH.
NO!

OPEN YOUR MOUTH!
LISTEN TO ME, SON--

WEâ€™RE GONNA DO THIS NOW,
COME ON!

SHUT UP!
STOP.

YOUâ€™RE GONNA BE QUIET.

COME ON.

[grunting]

AARON, STAY HERE
AND WATCH... THE HORSE.

STUPID!
STUPID!

LOOK, I DONâ€™T KNOW
WHAT THE OLD GUY SAW,

BUT I JUST COULDNâ€™T TAKE
THE CHANCE.

AFTER HE SPOTTED THE TWO OF YOU,

I FIGURED THERE WAS NO WAY
TO AVOID SUSPICION.

MAYBE HEâ€™LL STAY QUIET.
Iâ€™M SURE.

NO, I MEAN,
WE SCARED HIM BAD ENOUGH.

YOU THINK HEâ€™S GONNA STAY
INTIMIDATED AFTER WEâ€™RE GONE?

MAN HELD UP ON HIS OWN LAND
MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN RAPED.

HEâ€™D GLADLY SHOOT US ALL
RIGHT NOW, IF HE COULD.

RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO DECIDE
WHAT WEâ€™RE GONNA DO.

Iâ€™M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE
THIS DAMN THING OUT.

THE WAY YOU PUT IT,
WEâ€™RE AS GOOD AS CAUGHT.

UNLESS YOU PLAN ON...

NO.
NO, THAT AINâ€™T NO OPTION.

BURYINâ€™ A WIFE-BEATIN'
ASSHOLE IS ONE THING.

BUT THIS WHOLE THING IS OVER.

UM, MR. TAYLORâ€™S
GONE TO SLEEP.

HEY, HEY!
HEY, HEY-HEY!

COME ON, MAN, HEY!

COME ON, HERE WE GO, COME ON!

HEY, COME ON, WAKE UP!
COME ON, MAN.

WHAT DO I DO?

I DONâ€™T KNOW.
COME ON!

AH, GOD!

COME ON!

COME ON, BREATHE,
YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

BREATHE!
COME ON, MAN, BREATHE!

LOOK AT ME!
LOOK AT ME!

AHH!


COME ON.

[sighs deeply]

I AINâ€™T GOIN' BACK.

NOT OVER THIS.

YOU SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN BETTER.

A MANâ€™S GOOD WORD
IS AS SURE AS HIS NAME.

I SAID A GOOD MANâ€™S WORD
IS AS SURE AS HIS NAME.

WHATâ€™S THE DIFFERENCE?
YOU SHOULD KNOW
AFTER YESTERDAY.

YOUâ€™RE JUST LIKE YOUR DAD.
YOU LISTEN BUT YOU DONâ€™T HEAR.

WELL, DAD DID ALL RIGHT.
HE GOT OUT OF THIS TOWN.

THAT HE DID. AND LEFT
YOUR MAMA A MOUTH TO FEED.

LOOK, THE MAN GOT A LOT
OF SWEAT OUTTA ME, MAN.

I WORK AS HARD AS HIS TWO
RANCH HICKS PUT TOGETHER.

I JUST EXPECT WHATâ€™S FAIR,
THATâ€™S ALL.

Iâ€™M SURE HE BEEN
PAYINâ€™ THE OTHERS.

YOU CANâ€™T NEVER EXPECT
WHAT YOU CANâ€™T HAND TO YOURSELF.

AND FAIR AINâ€™T ALWAYS
WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

LET IT GO, GIL.

Iâ€™LL TALK TO TAYLOR.

HEâ€™LL COME IN NEXT WEEK
FOR SUPPLIES.

AND IT SEEMS THE PRICE
OF FENCE WIRE JUST SHOT UP

A FAIR PENNY.

NOW THAT, YOU CAN EXPECT.

ALL RIGHT?

HOW YOU FEELINâ€™?

KINDA FUNNY.

YEAH. ME, TOO.

YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO?

YEAH.

WE HAD A DEAL, RIGHT?

ONE LAST MISSION,
JUST LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT.

AARON, WHEREâ€™S DADDY?

HEâ€™S NOT COMIN'.

OH.

WILL YOU GIVE THIS
TO HIM, SWEETIE?

THEY SAID I HAVE TO STAY
ONE MORE NIGHT.

HEâ€™S NOT COMIN' BACK.

WHAT?

WHOâ€™S NOT COMIN' BACK?

HEâ€™S GONE.

I MEAN, HE SAID SO,
AND THEN, HE JUST LEFT.

THATâ€™S JUST NOT TRUE.

DONâ€™T YOU TELL ME NO FIB,
NOW, AARON.

THATâ€™S JUST NOT TRUE.

WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

YOU HEAR ME?

I TOLD HIM
I DONE FIXED THE WINDOW.

DID YOU SAY YOU WERE GONNA
TELL SOMEBODY...

ABOUT THIS?

DONâ€™T YOU LIE TO ME, SON.

AARON!
[stammering]

I TOLD HIM
WAS WE GONNA COME SEE YA.

YOU SAID MORE THAN THAT,
YOU LITTLE SHIT.

WHENâ€™D HE LEAVE?

LAST NIGHT.

MAMA.

THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

HAVINâ€™ TO RAISE SOME HALF-WIT
WOULD MAKE ANY MAN TURN AND RUN.

YOU GO FIND HIM,
YOU HEAR?

YOU FIND HIM
AND BRING HIM BACK TO ME.

BUT, MAMA, I CANâ€™T.

ARE YOU TELLINâ€™ ME
WHY YOU CANâ€™T?

EXCUSE ME.

Iâ€™M SORRY, BUT I BROUGHT
AARON OVER HERE,

AND Iâ€™M ALREADY LATE
TO MEET CARRIE.

DANNY...

YOU HELP AARON
FIND MY HUSBAND.

I SEEN YOU WITH
SID COTSWOLDâ€™S DAUGHTER.

YOU UNDERSTAND.

WALTER IS ALL I GOT.

YOU REST NOW,
MRS. PERKINS.

Iâ€™LL DO WHAT I CAN.

COME ON, AARON.

MAâ€™AM.

A FEW YEARS AGO,

SHANE AND I WALKED INTO
THE SCHOOL BATHROOM

ON THE WAY TO PRACTICE.

THERE WAS A FEW GUYS
LAUGHINâ€™ IN THE CORNER.

WE STEPPED UP A LITTLE CLOSER
TO SEE WHAT WAS SO FUNNY.

THERE WAS THIS SKINNY KID

STANDINâ€™ UP AGAINST
A WALL.

HIS LIPS WERE ALL
SWOLLEN OUT

LIKE TWO GRUB WORMS.

HIS FACE WAS STREAKED
BY BLACK MARKER,

EXCEPT WHERE HE
CRIED OFF THE INK.

BEFORE I KNEW IT, SHANE HAD
ONE OF THOSE FELLAS

CHIN-DOWN ON THE SINK,
SPITTINâ€™ TEETH AND BLOOD.

EVERYONE WAS RUNNINâ€™
FOR THE DOOR.

SIX MONTHS LATER,
WHEN SHANE CAME OUT OF CRAGGY,

JEFFERSON HIGH
CLOSED THE DOOR ON HIM.

THAT WAS THE DAY I MET
YOUR SON, MRS. PERKINS.

THAT DAY IN THE BATHROOM.

NOW THOSE TWO FELLAS PUT HIM UP
TO THE BLACKFACE, Iâ€™M SURE.

THEY DIDNâ€™T BUST UP
HIS LIPS.

SOMEBODY ELSE
ALREADY DONE THAT

BEFORE AARON
EVER GOT TO SCHOOL.

LIKE I SAID,
Iâ€™LL DO WHAT I CAN.

[dog barking]

YOU KNOW AARONâ€™S SITUATION.

JUST--I WAITED UP, IS ALL.

MORNING, MR. CROW.

YOU ENTITLED TO YOUR PAIN,
MR. SHEPHERD.

YOU WIN THOSE BOOTS BACK YET?

HEY, THIS IS
GROWN FOLKSâ€™ BUSINESS.

GUESS NOT. YOU KNOW,
YOU KEEP ON PLAYING CARDS

WITH THOSE FELLAS
DOWN IN CHEROKEE,

YOUâ€™RE GONNA BE
STANDING HERE NAKED BEFORE LONG.

IT CAN ONLY BE
GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

SHE TOLD ME ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

HOWâ€™S THE BOY'S MOTHER DOING?

LIKE USUAL.

MAYBE WORSE.
MM.

YOU SEEN GIL TODAY?
GIL?

HEâ€™S JUST ROLLIN' OUT OF BED
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

WELL, NOT TODAY.
HE CAME IN HERE THIS MORNING

SAYING TAYLOR OWED HIM
SOME MONEY.

TOOK MY TRUCK
WHEN I CAME INSIDE HERE.

I EXPECT HE WENT TO SETTLE UP.

SHEPHERD.
NO, NO, I HAVENâ€™T SEEN HIM.

Yâ€™ALL TAKE CARE
OF THE TRUCK?

PAINTER GORGE.

HADNâ€™T BEEN A TRAIL
THROUGH THERE IN TEN YEARS.

[clears throat]

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

HEY, SHANE.

YOU THINK WE DID
THE RIGHT THING?

YEAH.

â™ª I SLEPT IN OUR ROOM
AND I SWORE â™ª

â™ª AND I SLEPT WITH OUR GHOSTS
PAINTING THE WALLS â™ª

â™ª AND OUR HAPPINESS
HUNG THERE â™ª

â™ª LIKE A MISTAKE
OR A LIGHT â™ª

â™ª TRULY YOUâ€™RE GONE â™ª

â™ª WANDERING HELPLESSLY NOW

â™ª GHOSTS PAINTING THE WALLS

â™ª WE ARE, WE ARE

â™ª YOU, SEARCHING,
YOU ARE GONE â™ª

â™ª HE SAYS

â™ª YOU

â™ª YOUâ€™RE GONE â™ª

â™ª YOU

â™ª YOUâ€™RE GONE â™ª

â™ª YOUâ€™RE GONE â™ª

GOOD MORNING, BESSIE.

HOW ARE YOU DOING, GIRL?

HI, YOU WANT
A LITTLE BIT OF THIS?

WHATâ€™S THIS?

[gasps, screams]

GOOD HIT, GOOD HIT.
WAY TO MOVE THE BALL.

WAY TO GO, GUYS, COME ON.
GET UP, ALL OF YOU.

LETâ€™S GO.
YOUâ€™RE UP AGAIN.

COME ON, MAN, INTO HUDDLE.
LETâ€™S GO.

32.
32, BLUE.

START IT UP.

ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
TAKE A KNEE.

DID YOU GO AND COW-NAP
THE HICKSBORO HEIFER AGAIN, TED?


[men talking indistinctly]

APPRECIATE IT.

YEAH.

GIL.
YEAH, COACH.

THEY WANT TO TALK TO YOU, SON.

YOUâ€™RE KIDDIN', RIGHT?
NO.

[sighs]
OH, MAN.

YOU WONâ€™T NEED THIS.

GIL PARKER?
YEAH.

YOU KNOW MORRIS TAYLOR?

MAN, THIS IS CRAZY.
YEAH.

THIS AINâ€™T RIGHT.
THIS AINâ€™T RIGHT.

HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,
THIS IS INSANE, MAN.

YEAH, I KNOW, THE MAN.
I WORK FOR HIM.

HEâ€™S DEAD.

HEY, LOOK, MAN,
Iâ€™M NO GODDAMN CRIMINAL, MAN.

LAY THE FUCK OFF OF ME.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
AH!

Iâ€™M GONNA LAY THE FUCK ON
THAT MOUTH OF YOURS

IF YOU DONâ€™T SHUT IT.
I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.

YOU BETTER TALK TO
A GOOD LAWYER.

LETâ€™S GO.

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED--

THATâ€™S ENOUGH.
HIT THE SHOWERS. GO!

DANNY.

I KNOW YOU AND GIL ARE TIGHT,
AND I LIKE THE KID.

HEâ€™S GOT HEART,
AND HEâ€™S GOT ABILITY.

BUT WHATEVER HEâ€™S DONE,
WHATEVER HAPPENS,

YOU STILL GOT A GAME TO PLAY
FRIDAY NIGHT.

DANNY, ALL EYES ARE GONNA BE
RIGHT HERE...

ON YOUR FUTURE.

OKAY?
GRAB A SHOWER.

THEYâ€™RE TREATIN' HIM LIKE
SOME KIND OF ANIMAL.

HEY, DONâ€™T COME IN MY OFFICE
UNTIL--HOLD ON.

JUST HOLD ON.

DANNY, IF Iâ€™D HAVE BEEN
DOWN THERE,

IT WOULDNâ€™T HAVE HAPPENED
THAT WAY.

WHY WERENâ€™T YOU DOWN THERE,
EMERSON?

BECAUSE I WAS WITH THE VICTIM.
THE VICTIM WAS ON THE FIELD.

HEY, LISTEN. JOEL AND ED
HAVE GOT THEIR OWN WAY

OF DEALING WITH A SUSPECT.

AND ITâ€™S A MORE
CONVENTIONAL WAY.

YEAH, PERFECT
TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE, Iâ€™M SURE.

HEY, DANNY.

I GOT A DEAD MAN FOUND BURIED
IN HIS OWN BARN,

BEING CRAPPED ON
BY HIS OWN ANIMALS.

I GOT A RANCH HAND WHO EXCHANGED
STRONG WORDS WITH THE MAN

TWO DAYS BEFORE,
ACCORDING TO THREE SOURCES,

AND WHO RESISTED ARREST IN FRONT
OF FOUR DOZEN WITNESSES,

INCLUDING YOU.

NOW, YOU WANT TO ADD STINK
ON TOP OF SHIT?

Iâ€™M JUST GONNA TELL YOU,
WHAT YOU SAW TODAY

IS THE WAY ITâ€™S DONE SOMETIMES.

YEAH.

[sighs]
HOWâ€™D TAYLOR DIE?

LOOK LIKE SUFFOCATION.
MAN HAD A CLOSED SEPTUM.

HE CAN ONLY BREATHE
THROUGH HIS MOUTH.

NOW, WHOEVER KILLED HIM
MIGHT HAVE BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH

TO KNOW THAT.

GILâ€™S GONNA GET HIMSELF
A LAWYER.

HEâ€™S GONNA GET A FAIR TRIAL.

THEN THE TRUTHâ€™S GONNA COME OUT.

[sighs]

[dog barking]

WHOA!

DUANE STINSON JUST ABOUT
DIDNâ€™T COME DOWN ON THIS ONE.

[door rattles]

BOBBY TURELLI TOO FAR BACK
IN THE PACK.

WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE DID
LAST YEAR,

TURNING IT ON TO WIN
IN THE FINAL LAP.

[TV clicks off]

WELL?

HEâ€™S THE ONLY SUSPECT.

THATâ€™S GOOD, RIGHT?

WHY DONâ€™T YOU ASK GIL THAT?

I MEAN, AS LONG AS THEY THINK
THEY GOT THEIR MAN.

IF WEâ€™RE REALLY LUCKY,
ITâ€™LL BE A SPEEDY TRIAL

AND THE TOWNâ€™LL CONVICT
AN INNOCENT FRIEND.

SHORT STINT ON DEATH ROW,
AND HEâ€™LL BE TOAST.

CASE CLOSED.

YOUâ€™RE STARTIN' TO THINK
LIKE A FUCKINâ€™ CRIMINAL, TAZ.

COME ON, MAN.
THATâ€™S WHAT WE ARE.

CRIMINALS.
ALL FOUR OF US.

LOOK, HEY, NONE OF US PLANNED
TO HAVE GIL TAKE THE RAP FOR US.

THATâ€™S THE WAY
IT IS, MAN, ALL RIGHT?

AT LEAST ITâ€™LL
BUY US SOME TIME

IN THE SHORT RUN.

UNLESS EITHER OF Yâ€™ALL
WANNA WALK INTO TOWN

AND TURN YOURSELVES IN, WHICH
I AINâ€™T GONNA LET YOU DO ANYWAY.

Yâ€™ALL SHOULDN'T DRINK
THEM THINGS SO MUCH.

MAKE YOU THINK ALL LOOPY.

YEAH, AARON. LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE LOOPY STORY

ABOUT THREE GUYS WHO DID
SOMETHING PRETTY FUCKINâ€™ STUPID

SO SOME KID DONâ€™T HAVE TO
SPEND HIS LIFE IN A CUCKOO NEST

WATCHING CARTOONS WITH
JUMPER CABLES HOOKED UP
TO HIS SCROTUM.

THATâ€™S CRAZY TALK, MAN.
MAYBE IT IS.

MAYBE THIS WHOLE THING HAS ME
A LITTLE BIT ON EDGE.

HOW ABOUT YOU, AARON?
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

FUCK THIS.

WHERE THE FUCK
ARE YOU GOINâ€™?

OH, MAN.
THIS IS GOOD.

THIS IS REAL GOOD, MAN.

LETâ€™S JUST ALL GO AT IT
WITH EACH OTHER,

AND THE ONES LEFT STANDING
CAN BLAME IT ON THE OTHERS.

GOOD IDEA.

DEAD CANâ€™T TALK.

I CANâ€™T STAND TRIAL
EITHER.

DADDY SHOOTS BLACKBIRDS
SOMETIMES.

HE SAYS THEYâ€™RE SPIES
FOR THE DEVIL.

THAT TRUE?

I DONâ€™T KNOW.

I THINK THEY JUST COME AROUND
FOR THE HOLLY BERRIES.

HEâ€™D JUST SHOOT 'EM?

AND IT MAKES HIM LAUGH.

THEN MAMA PICKS UP
THE FEATHERS.

WE SHOULD MAKE HIM
LAUGH, TOO.

I TRIED ONCE.
TOLD HIM KNOCK, KNOCK.

DID HE LIKE IT?

I THINK I TOLD IT WRONG.

AARON...

HEâ€™S NOT COMIN' BACK.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
RIGHT?

DO YOU THINK THEM BLACKBIRDS
IS GONNA COME LOOKINâ€™ FOR ME,

â€™CAUSE OF WHAT I DONE?

WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

YOU GOT ANY HOLLY BERRIES
FOR â€™EM?

NO.

I GUESS NOT.

I WONâ€™T LET 'EM
FIND YOU, AARON.

DANNY, THAT RINGINâ€™
NEVER WENT AWAY.

IT WILL.

SHIT, CROW.

YOU EXPECTING SOMEONE ELSE?

WASNâ€™T EXPECTING ANYONE.

A LOT OF FOLKSâ€™ HEADSTONES
COULD READ JUST THAT.

PEOPLE ARE QUICK TO BLAME
IN A TOWN THIS SIZE.

CANâ€™T MUCH KEEP 'EM STILL
WHEN A NEIGHBOR TURNS UP DEAD,

EVEN ONE LIKE MORRIS TAYLOR.

HOWâ€™S GIL?

HE STAYED SICK OFF OF
THAT CABBAGE THEY FEEDINâ€™ HIM,

BUT, UH...HE LOOKS GOOD.

YOU COULDâ€™VE GONE TO SEE HIM.

I WILL.

I JUST WANTED
TO TEST A THEORY FIRST.

YOU KNOW THAT DEBT SHEET
YOU HAD OUT THE OTHER DAY?

I SAW WALTER PERKINSâ€™ NAME
ON IT.

YOU STILL HAVE IT?

TRUST ME, CROW.

THIS MAY HELP GIL.

YOU KNOW,
WE ONLY PLAY FOR POINTS.

WHOEVERâ€™S GOT THE MOST POINTS
AT THE END OF THE MONTH

GETS A STEAK DINNER
COMPLIMENTS OF THE LOSERS.

OF COURSE, SOME FOLKS TEND
TO GET SCARCE COME DINNERTIME.

MAKES SENSE.

1,300 POINTS.
MM-HMM.

THATâ€™S A HELL OF A LOT
OF STEAK DINNERS.

YOUâ€™RE NOT GONNA ERASE
TAYLORâ€™S NAME, ARE YOU?

OR WALTERâ€™S?
WHY WOULD I?

NO, I JUST MEANT,
UNLESS YOU THINK

HEâ€™S GONNA
PASS THROUGH AGAIN.

DEATH IS A POOR EXCUSE
FOR A MAN NOT TO PAY HIS DUE.

COWARDICE IS WORSE.

AND YOUR THEORY?

SHERIFF BRODY HAS
THE WRONG MAN.

WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

I THINK I COULD PROVE IT.

THIS IS A SMALL TOWN,
SHEPHERD.

A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE WATCHING YOU.

REMEMBER THAT.

[speaking indistinctly]

HEY, EMERSON.
EMERSON, WE NEED TO TALK.

HEY.

I GOT TEN MINUTES FOR LUNCH,
AND THE SPECIAL TAKES 15.

SO DONâ€™T GET THE SPECIAL.

ARENâ€™T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
IN SCHOOL?

I GOT A NOTE FROM MY MOMMY.
DANNY...

SIGNED BY THE LORD HIMSELF.
THEY COULDNâ€™T REFUSE.

LISTEN, THIS IS IMPORTANT.

NOW, I CANâ€™T BEGIN
TO EXPLAIN HERE,

BUT THE PIT STOP
MAKES AN EGG SANDWICH

IN TWO MINUTES FLAT.

NOTHINGâ€™S CHANGED.

WEâ€™RE COMPILING THE EVIDENCE.
WEâ€™RE ASKING QUESTIONS.

PERSONALLY, Iâ€™D LIKE
TO SEE US COME UP SHORT.

BUT THE MAN DIDNâ€™T BURY HIMSELF.
I KNOW.

Iâ€™M JUST ASKING YOU TO CONSIDER
SOMETHING, THATâ€™S ALL.

NOW, Iâ€™M NO HARDY BOY,

BUT I KNOW GIL BETTER
THAN Yâ€™ALL DO.

IF HE DID IT, THEN WHY?

HATE, REVENGE, MAYBE MONEY.

MRS. TAYLOR SAID SHE SAW HIM
SNEAKING AROUND OUT THERE

THE DAY AFTER
HE WALKED OFF HIS JOB.

YOU DONâ€™T GO KILL SOME GUY

JUST â€™CAUSE HE STIFFED YOU
A FEW BUCKS.

I MEAN, EVEN IF THAT GUY IS
A SPITEFUL BIGOT,

AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU GOT
A FUTURE TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

I WOULDNâ€™T, AND YOU WOULDN'T.

BUT WHAT WE GOT ON GIL...

MOTIVE, EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY,
NO ALIBI...

THATâ€™S ALL PRETTY DAMN SOLID.
WE GOT NO ALTERNATE SCENARIO.

I DO.

OH, YOU DO?

COME ON.

MORRIS TAYLOR OWED
WALTER PERKINS $1,300.

WALTER PERKINS GOT
HIS OWN PROBLEMS,
HE SKIPS TOWN.

BUT ON HIS WAY OUT, HE STOPS AT
TAYLORâ€™S RANCH TO COLLECT.

AND HOW MANY FOLKS YOU KNOW

GOT $1,300
LAYING AROUND THE HOUSE?

TAYLOR DOESNâ€™T.

AND WE BOTH KNOW WALTER
AINâ€™T MUCH OF A SWEETHEART,

SO THE OLD MAN
PAYS WITH HIS LIFE.

TAYLOR WENT HUNTING ON WEEKENDS.
WALTER KNEW THAT.

MRS. TAYLOR WOULDNâ€™T HAVE EVEN
MISSED HER HUSBAND TILL MONDAY.

YOU...
Yâ€™ALL OKAY HERE?

CAN I HAVE
SOME MORE TEA, SWEET?

OKAY.

THOUGHT THAT UP
BY YOURSELF, HUH?

WHEREâ€™D THE DEBT COME FROM?

I CANâ€™T SAY.

WELL, IT AINâ€™T GONNA HOLD
A DROP OF PISS UNLESS YOU DO.

I WILL, BELIEVE ME.

BUT RIGHT NOW, I NEED TO KNOW
IF YOU THINK ITâ€™S POSSIBLE.

ANYTHINGâ€™S POSSIBLE.
OH, COME ON, EMERSON.

Iâ€™LL LOOK INTO IT.

THANKS.

BIT CHILLY, AINâ€™T IT,
MRS. PERKINS?

DONâ€™T MIND NONE.

WELL, SOME DONâ€™T.

Iâ€™M EMERSON COTSWOLD, MA'AM.
Iâ€™M A DEPUTY TO SHERIFF BRODY.

I KNOW.
I KNOW YOUR MOTHER.

YEAH, I GUESS THATâ€™S RIGHT.

WELL, I HATE TO COME TRAIPSING
OUT HERE LIKE THIS,

BUT Iâ€™M WONDERING
WHERE I MIGHT FIND YOUR HUSBAND.

HE AINâ€™T HOME.

WELL, THATâ€™S
KIND OF THE THING.

UH, HE OWES SOME FOLKS
SOME PROMISED WORK.

AND A FEW OF THEM,
THEYâ€™RE KIND OF ON ME.

THEYâ€™RE WONDERING
ABOUT THE SITUATION HERE.

WELL, YOU CAN TELL THEM

THAT THEY CAN COME
AND GET THEIR CARS

AND DRIVE THEM
STRAIGHT ON INTO HELL.

SENDING YOU
TO SLAP MY WALTERâ€™S WRIST

LIKE SOME NANNY
ARM OF THE LAW.

IT AINâ€™T LIKE THAT, MA'AM.

THEY JUST NEED TO KNOW,
IS HE COMING HOME?

I EXPECT HIM SHORTLY.

WELL...

OKAY, THEN.

YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT ARM,
AND...

YOU GIVE US A CALL
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LISTEN UP.

GATHER UP.


I JUST WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW,
YOU REMINDED ME

OF MY WIFEâ€™S BRIDGE CLUB
OUT THERE TODAY.

AND THAT IS THE MOST
MEAN-SPIRITED

BUNCH OF WOMEN I HAVE EVER MET!

[laughter and cheering]

GOOD WORK, GUYS.

GIVE YOURSELF A HAND.

DANNY.

DANNY, THIS IS BUD GILES
AND JERRY CRAY FROM WCU.

CAME DOWN TO SEE WHAT KIND
OF PROGRAM WEâ€™RE RUNNING.

HELLO, DANNY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

LOOKS LIKE WE CAME
ON THE RIGHT WEEK.

I HOPE TO SAY.

YES, SIR.

DANNY, Iâ€™LL COME
STRAIGHT TO IT.

I LIKE WHAT I SEE.

YES, WE DO.
THATâ€™S RIGHT.

SON, YOU GOT MORE THAN
POTENTIAL. YOU GOT TALENT.

NOW, I DONâ€™T SAY THAT OFTEN
TO FELLAS LIKE YOURSELF

BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TENDENCY
TO GET ALL STARRY-EYED...

YEAH, THEY TAKE THE FANCY.

THEN I GOT NO USE FOR â€™EM.

BUT I CAN TELL
YOUâ€™RE DIFFERENT.

THATâ€™S WHY WE CAME
TO EXTEND AN INVITATION

FOR YOU TO COME SEE OUR CAMPUS,
MEET THE TEAM...

THE CHEERLEADERS.
[laughter]

YOU KNOW, GET A FEEL
FOR WHAT WESTERN HAS TO OFFER,

EXPENSES COVERED.

UM, WELL, I...
UM...

DONâ€™T THINK TOO LONG.

NO, NO, I MEAN, YEAH.

OF COURSE, I--THAT SOUNDS--
Iâ€™D BE INTERESTED.

[laughs]

WELL, HEâ€™S INTERESTED.

WELL, GOOD.
GOOD.

NOW, YOU TAKE IT TO â€™EM
OUT THERE ON FRIDAY,

AND WEâ€™LL SEE YOU
AT THE VICTORY PARTY,

GET THAT VISIT SET UP.

THANKS.
THANKS A LOT.

HEY, UM...I COULD BRING
A FRIEND ALONG. GIL PARKER?

HE WASNâ€™T OUT THERE TODAY,
BUT...

MAN, HEâ€™S THE FASTEST BACK
THIS PART OF THE STATE.

YEAH, WE KNOW.

HOW ABOUT WE HAVE
JUST YOU UP, DANNY...

FOR A START?

I MEAN, MR. PARKERâ€™S SITUATION,
ITâ€™S...

ITâ€™S PEPPERY.
PEPPERY.

YOU UNDERSTAND.

YEAH.

THATâ€™S ALL, SHEPHERD.

GOOD WORK OUT THERE TODAY.

THATâ€™S A FINE BOY
YOU GOT THERE, COACH.

THAT ONEâ€™S A PILLAR.

[gate clangs]

[keys jangling]

[gate clangs]

[door slams]

GIL?

SHEPHERD?

YEAH.

DAMN, MAN, WHAT, YOU GET LOST
ON THE WAY OVER HERE?

[sighs]

I DIDNâ€™T KNOW
WHEN THEYâ€™D LET ME COME VISIT.

EMERSON KIND OF SNUCK ME
BY HERE TONIGHT.

ALL RIGHT.

HOW YOU DOINâ€™?

MAN, I GOT THE RUNS
LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER.

OTHER THAN THAT...

Iâ€™M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.
EVERYTHING.

I AINâ€™T KILLED NOBODY.

I KNOW.

BUT THATâ€™S WHAT MOST FOLKS
THINK, THOUGH, RIGHT?

HUH?


THAT DONâ€™T...THAT DON'T...

THAT DONâ€™T WORRY ME NONE,

â€™CAUSE WHEN I GET BACK OUT THERE
ON THAT FIELD,

THE ONLY THING THAT THEYâ€™RE
GONNA BE THINKING IS,

"MAN, THAT DUDE CAN FLY."

[chuckling]

WERE THOSE...

WERE THOSE COACHES THERE
FROM WESTERN THIS WEEK?

YEAH.
YEAH.

YEAH?

THEY--DID THEY SEE MY TAPE?

YEAH, YEAH, THEY...

THEY SAID YOU WERE
AS QUICK AS THEYâ€™D SEEN.

FOR REAL?
YEAH.

[chuckles]

OH, MAN.
DAMN.

DAMN.

TOMORROW NIGHT IS IT,
AND Iâ€™M GONNA BE

IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

FUCK ALL THESE
SIMPLE MOTHERFUCKERS

THEY JUST COME AND TURN
MY LIFE ON END

LIKE THEY SERVE GODâ€™S HAND.

THEY JUST THE DEVIL
OF A FUCKED-UP PAST.

YOU KNOW THAT?

AND THEYâ€™RE ALL GONNA
DIE LIKE THAT

WITHOUT KNOWINâ€™
ANY DIFFERENT.

JUST SIMPLE MOTHERFUCKERS.

GIL.

I WOULDNâ€™T TALK TOO LOUD
ABOUT FOLKS DYINâ€™.

ALL MY LIFE, MAN,
I NEVER WANTED TO HURT NOBODY.

IT NEVER EVEN
CROSSED MY MIND TILL--

TILL THEY PUT ME
IN THIS PLACE.

Iâ€™M GONNA MAKE YOU
A PROMISE, GIL,

AND ONE I HAVE
THE POWER TO KEEP.

YOUâ€™LL BE OUT OF HERE SOON.

YOU HAVE MY WORD.

SHEPHERD...

I HOPE YOUâ€™RE FOR REAL, MAN,

â€™CAUSE I NEED
A PROMISE RIGHT NOW.

I NEED SOMETHING.

TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF IN HERE.

ALL RIGHT.

GO ON AND GET THE REST,
WHATâ€™S ON THE LINE.

AARON, DID YOU HEAR ME, SON?

WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN YOUR HANDS?

THEY WAS OUT.

NOTHING WAS OUT.

THEYâ€™RE YOUR MAMA'S.

LIKE YOUR SCHOOL PAPERS?

NO, AARON,
THEYâ€™RE FROM YOUR FATHER.

WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

[sighs]

THEYâ€™RE FROM
A LONG TIME AGO, HONEY.

YOU REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
DADDY WAS FAR AWAY THAT TIME--

BEFORE YOU WERE BORN?

I SHOWED YOU ON THE MAP.

WHEN HE WAS IN THE WAR.

THATâ€™S RIGHT.

WELL, I COULDNâ€™T TALK TO HIM
ON THE TELEPHONE

A LOT OF THE TIME,
SO I WROTE DOWN LETTERS,

AND Iâ€™D SEND THEM TO HIM,

AND HEâ€™D SEND ONES HE WROTE
BACK TO ME.

AFTER Iâ€™D READ 'EM,
Iâ€™D PUT 'EM IN A COOKIE TIN

SO THEY WOULDNâ€™T GET LOST.

THESE ARE THEM LETTERS.

HOW COME
THEYâ€™RE KIND OF YELLOW?

ITâ€™S 'CAUSE THEYâ€™RE OLD.

AND--AND YOU KEEP â€™EM STILL?

YES, I DO.

THEYâ€™RE PART OF MY LIFE.

JUST LIKE WHEN YOU WROTE
THAT NICE CARD FOR ME

FOR MOTHERâ€™S DAY.

I KEPT THAT TOO.

AND DADDY BOUGHT IT.

YEAH.

IT WAS REAL NICE.


AARON...

I KNOW YOUR DADDY
HAS SOMETIMES SAID THINGS

THAT...HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

HEâ€™S DONE STUFF TOO
THAT--THAT SEEMS MEAN, BUT...

WHEN YOU GET RESTLESS,
YOU KNOW,

I TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHATâ€™S WRONG,

OR I TAKE YOU
TO SEE DR. HUSKINS.

WELL, YOUR DADDYâ€™S WORRIES
ARE...

WELL, THEYâ€™RE JUST HARD FOR HIM
TO TALK ABOUT IS ALL.

HE LOVES YOU VERY MUCH,
THOUGH, SON.

WE BOTH DO.

COME HERE.

ITâ€™LL GET BETTER.

HEY, RUSS.

GOOD MORNING.

DISPATCH JUST GOT A CALL
FROM JACK CROWâ€™S STORE.

COUPLE OF CLIMBERS
FOUND A WRECKED TRUCK

DOWN IN PAINTER GORGE.

NO BODY.
JUNK DROP?

DONâ€™T THINK SO.

THE REGISTRATION WAS
IN THE GLOVE BOX.

ITâ€™S WALT PERKINS' FORD.

[tires skidding]

RIVERâ€™S DOWN TODAY.

Iâ€™M ALREADY LATE
FOR CLASS, CROW.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

[sighs]
THIS AINâ€™T ABOUT FISHIN', IS IT?

MAN, WHAT ARE YOU

WHEREâ€™S AARON?
WHAT?! SHIT, I DONâ€™T KNOW.

HEâ€™S PROBABLY OUTSIDE
DRAWINâ€™ PICTURES OF SOMETHIN'.

SHANE, THEY

Iâ€™M SORRY, SWEETIE,
YOUâ€™RE GONNA HAVE TO GO, OKAY?

[dog barking]

MAâ€™AM...

WALTER AINâ€™T HERE.

I KNOW.

YOU MIND IF I COME IN
FOR A SECOND?

CAN I GET YOU
A DRINK OR SOMETHING?

Iâ€™M ALL RIGHT.

YOUâ€™RE A GUEST IN MY HOME,
EVEN IF I DIDNâ€™T INVITE YOU.

GLASS OF WATER
WOULD BE FINE THEN.

Iâ€™D OFFER YOU A CHAIR,
BUT HE TOOK IT WITH HIM.

WHY HE LEFT THE TV,
I NEVER WATCH THE THING.

MRS. PERKINS,
WE FOUND YOUR HUSBANDâ€™S TRUCK.

IT WAS OUTSIDE THE COUNTY.

WALTER WOULD NEVER LEAVE
HIS TRUCK FOR LONG.

HE MUST BE ROUND ABOUT
WHERE YOU FOUND IT.

MAYBE HE JUST NEEDED
SOME TIME AWAY,

WENT TO A MOTEL.

MAâ€™AM.

THE TRUCK WAS 100 FOOT DOWN
PAINTER GORGE.

SWEET JESUS.

NOW, I DONâ€™T THINK
WALTER WAS IN IT.

[sighs]

TELL ME, DID HE EVER MENTION
BEING OWED ANY MONEY?

THERE WAS ALWAYS FOLKS
SLOW PAYING FOR WORK...

RIGHT.

I DONâ€™T KNOW.
NO.

NO, HE NEVER SAID NOTHING.

GO AND TAKE THOSE TO MY ROOM
AND STAY THERE.

FOLD â€™EM UP.

AND, SON, GET YOUR BOOK.

N-N-NO.

NO, NO, NO.

PICK THOSE CLOTHES UP.

Iâ€™M SORRY.
I WAS TRYING TO HELP.

WHATâ€™S THIS?

AARON...

IS THIS...

DADDY?

DAMN, MAN,
WITH ALL THAT BLOOD,

THEYâ€™RE GONNA GET
A CLEAN PRINT FOR SURE.

Iâ€™M TELLING YOU,
MINE ARE DEFINITELY ON FILE.

WELL, MAYBE THAT LEAD
I INVENTED

WILL SET â€™EM OFF
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

I DONâ€™T KNOW,
BUT, SHANE,

I TOLD CROW ABOUT TAYLOR.
WHAT?

WERE YOU WILLING
TO LEAVE TOWN NOT KNOWING

HOW LONG GILâ€™S GONNA HAVE TO SIT
IN THAT JAIL CELL

FOR SOMETHING WE DID?

MAN, WHAT ABOUT TAZ?

[sighs]
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND HIM.

WELL, MAYBE HE DOESNâ€™T CARE
TO BE FOUND, OR DESERVE TO.

COME ON, MAN, YOU SAY THAT

LIKE WE HAVENâ€™T KNOWN TAZ
FOR TEN YEARS.

[sighs]
UGH.

I KNOW.
I KNOW.

OKAY, Iâ€™LL SEE YOU OUT THERE.

I GOT TO GET TO AARON
BEFORE THE BLACKBIRDS DO.

BEFORE THE WHAT?
JUST--I GAVE HIM MY WORD.

6:00.

YOUâ€™D HAVE GONE SOMETIME,
I FIGURED...

BUT NOT LIKE THIS.

[sighs]

I AINâ€™T GONNA HAVE TIME
TO GO VISIT DADDY, MAMA.

HEâ€™S NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE.

PROBABLY ALREADY KNOWS.

HEâ€™S UP THERE
GRINNINâ€™ EAR TO EAR SAYIN',

"LOOK AT MY BOY;
AINâ€™T HE A SCOUNDREL?"

TO ANYBODY WHOâ€™D LISTEN.



WELL, MAMA...

[screen door bangs]

YOU RUN NOW, SHANE.

YOU KEEP ON RUNNINâ€™
AND DONâ€™T LOOK BACK.

YOUâ€™RE GONNA BE JUST FINE.


IF YOU COULD WATCH OUT
FOR CARRIE, Iâ€™D APPRECIATE IT,

MAYBE FIND HER A JOB
SOMEPLACE RESPECTABLE.

MM-HMM.

DANNY, UM...

YOU KNOW THAT
WHEN I MARRIED LILY,

I TOOK HER CHEROKEE NAME.

WELL, SHE KNEW YOU
FROM THE TIME YOUR MOTHER DIED,

WHICH WAS THE YEAR
YOUR DAD CAME TO WORK FOR US.

SHE ALWAYS CALLED YOU
"LITTLE SHEPHERD,"

â€™CAUSE YOU'D CHASE
ALL THE SQUIRRELS AWAY

BEFORE YOUR FRIENDS
COULD SHOOT â€™EM WITH PELLETS.


ANYWAY, WHEN YOUR DAD LEFT HERE
LOOKING FOR WORK

AND NEVER CAME BACK,

LILY HAD YOUR NAME CHANGED.

SHE ALWAYS THOUGHT
A PERSONâ€™S NAME

SHOULD SAY MORE ABOUT â€™EM
THAN WHERE THEYâ€™RE FROM.

[dog barking]

YOUR DADâ€™S NAME IS REED.

HE TALKED ABOUT THIS PLACE
A FEW TIMES

JUST BEFORE HE LEFT.

ITâ€™S--IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE
ALBERTA.

[sighs]

THANKS, CROW.

I HEAR THE FISHINâ€™S REAL GOOD
UP IN CANADA THIS TIME OF YEAR.

STEELHEAD TROUT SEASON.

Iâ€™D HURRY ON UP THERE,
IF I WAS YOU.

GO ON.


[engine turns over]

THEY GOT AARON.

WHAT?

WHEREâ€™S TAZ?

MAN, I DONâ€™T KNOW.

CANâ€™T GET A PEEP
OUT OF THE PLACE.

HIS CARâ€™S AROUND BACK,
BUT...

I DONâ€™T KNOW. HE EITHER
AINâ€™T SHOWING, OR HE AIN'T HOME.

TAZ!

TAZ!

LOOK, WE DONâ€™T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS SHIT.

NOW, YOU CAN EITHER
STEP OUT HERE

AND GET IN
THE GODDAMN TRUCK,

OR YOU CAN STAY
HOLED UP IN THERE,

AND THE SHERIFFâ€™S BOYS
BREAK DOWN THE DOOR

WITH THE SPECIAL BOOT THEY GOT
PREPARED FOR YOUR ASS.

YOU GOT ABOUT FIVE SECONDS,

â€™CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
EITHER WAY.

YOU MEAN THAT?

WHAT?
YOU DONâ€™T CARE WHAT I DO?

[sighs]

TAZ, WEâ€™RE STANDING HERE

YELLING AT AN EMPTY CABIN
FOR ALL WE KNOW.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

WELL, HOLD ON.

[sighs]

129â€™s GONNA TAKE US
INTO TENNESSEE.

WE HIT INTERSTATE IN KNOXVILLE,
THEN ITâ€™S A FLAT-OUT RUN.

WELL, THATâ€™S IF WE STAY
AHEAD OF â€™EM.

OKAY, SO, MAN, LETâ€™S GO.

WAIT.
1974 RUNS BACK INTO I-40.

MY PARENTS USED TO GO THIS WAY
TO GATLINBURG.

HEY, MAN, I DONâ€™T GIVE A SHIT
WHICH WAY WE GO, MAN.

FORGET IT.
WE AINâ€™T GOIN' NOWHERE.

SHANE!

SHANE, COME ON!

[dog barking]

HOT DAMN,
I TOLD Yâ€™ALL.

WHATâ€™D I SAY?

WHOO!
WE GOT US A FIGHT COMING.

JIM, GET YOUR ASS BACK.

WHOSE ASS IN THE BREEZE NOW,
BROTHER?

I AINâ€™T GONNA TELL YOU AGAIN.

GET YOUR ASS BACK THERE.
KEEP IT BACK THERE.

WHAT THE HELL?
WHATâ€™S HE DOING HERE?

Iâ€™M SORRY, MAN.

SHIT!

BOYS, WE NEED TO TALK.

WEâ€™RE FUCKED!

WALTER PERKINS DONE
TURNED IN HIS TICKET, I EXPECT.

IS THAT RIGHT, SON?

HEâ€™S SAID ENOUGH ALREADY.

THOSE PICTURES OF HIS
SPEAK A WHOLE HEAP OF WORDS.

REAL LIFE-LIKE TOO.

WHATâ€™S HE TALKIN' ABOUT?
I DONâ€™T KNOW.

THEREâ€™S A PAGE MISSING
FROM AARONâ€™S BOOK.

I NEVER FOUND IT.

Yâ€™ALL GOT
ONE MORE DECISION TO MAKE.

SO TAKE YOUR TIME.

ITâ€™S UP TO YOU.

BUT LET ME TELL YOU
HOW THIS SHOWâ€™S GONNA END.

YOUâ€™RE GONNA WALK OUT
ON THE PORCH,

YOUâ€™RE GONNA
COME ALONG WITH ME,

AND WEâ€™LL
TALK THIS THING THROUGH

WITH 12 REAL
REASONABLE-TYPE FOLKS.

[scoffs]
YEAH.

BECAUSE Yâ€™ALL ARE
TOO DAMN SMART TO DO OTHERWISE.

LIKE I SAID,
TAKE YOUR TIME.

HOLD HIM IN THE VAN.

WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

HAVINâ€™ A DAMN PICNIC.
[both sigh]

WELL, WE AINâ€™T EXACTLY
THE DALTON GANG

HELD UP IN HERE.
FUCK â€™EM.

THEY CAN COME GET US.

THEY SHOULD LET JIMBO
LEAD THE CHARGE.

DANNY...

DANNY.

WHAT IS IT?

WHAT YOU DOINâ€™?
HEY.

CARRIE?

CARRIE, STOP. WEâ€™RE NOT
PLAYINâ€™ AROUND OUT HERE.

LET ME SEE HER.
GOT A GUN.

PUT IT DOWN.
PUT IT DOWN.

SHE KNOWS WHATâ€™S FOR REAL.

GET HIM BACK IN THERE.

[sighs]

MAN, I CANâ€™T SEE A DAMN THING.
CAN YOU?

NO.

BUT THEY CAN.

ONLY WHERE THEYâ€™RE POINTING.

SEARCHLIGHTS DIDNâ€™T MAKE
THE BUDGET THIS YEAR.

FELLAS?

WEâ€™RE READY TO TALK.

WEâ€™VE BEEN READY.

COME ON OUT ON THE PORCH.

DANNY?

Iâ€™M GONNA GO.

OKAY, WELL,
Iâ€™M GOING WITH YOU.

NO, JUST STAY PUT.

SHIT!
[gun cocks]

YOUâ€™RE OUT THERE?

RIGHT HERE.

HOW ABOUT THE FRONT STEPS?

OKAY.

SHIT, DANNY,
WHATâ€™D I TELL YOU?

OH, COME ON, MAN.
WHAT GOOD IS THAT?

MAYBE GET YOU TO THINK
FOR ONE GODDAMN MINUTE...

THAT THIS IS SERIOUS.

WE GOT A COUPLE GUYS OUT THERE

ACT LIKE THEYâ€™RE
SPOTLIGHTINâ€™ DEER.

THEYâ€™RE JUST WAITIN' FOR Yâ€™ALL
TO GIVE THEM AN EXCUSE.

ALL Iâ€™VE BEEN DOIN'
IS THINKING...

ABOUT HOW TO TURN
THINGS AROUND.

YOU SHOULDâ€™VE NEVER LET IT
GET THIS FAR.

THERE MUST BE
100 KIDS IN THIS TOWN

WHOâ€™D HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING
TO HAVE YOUR FUTURE

IN FRONT OF â€™EM.

NOW LOOK WHERE YOU STAND.

DONâ€™T PUT MY SISTER
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

AND MAKE THINGS WORSE.

THAT AINâ€™T THE WAY.

THEN TELL ME WHAT IS--
THE WAY BY LAW.

THE REACH OF YOUR LAW

STOPPED AT THAT KIDâ€™S FRONT DOOR
FOR 17 YEARS.

YOUâ€™RE RIGHT.

WE NEVER SHOULDâ€™VE LET IT
GET THIS FAR.

WHY DID YOU?

I ALWAYS LIKED YOU, DANNY.

I TREATED YOU LIKE A BROTHER,

â€™CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY
IT SEEMED SOMETIMES.

BUT YOUâ€™RE NO KIN TO ME.

IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO CARRIE...

[door rattles]

[sighs]
WHATâ€™D HE SAY?

HE DOESNâ€™T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

BEINâ€™ WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW,
Iâ€™D LET US GO.

THEN WHY DONâ€™T YOU
SUGGEST THAT?


LOOK.

FIVE MINUTES OUT OF THIS COVE
IN ANY DIRECTION,

AND THEYâ€™RE GONNA BE
RIGHT ON TOP OF US.

WE GOT SHIT FOR ODDS.

GREAT PEP TALK, CAPâ€™N.

HEâ€™S RIGHT, SHANE.

WE CAN WAIT THIS THING OUT
A LONG TIME,

BUT THEYâ€™LL WAIT LONGER.

IF THEY DO DECIDE
TO BUST ON IN,

I DONâ€™T KNOW.

NO, YOU DONâ€™T.

NEITHER OF YOU DO.


COULD YOU GIVE US
A MINUTE, PLEASE, CARRIE?

PLEASE?

SIX MONTHS IN CRAGGY PRISON
JUST ABOUT DOTTED ME.

OKAY? IT WERENâ€™T
THE SICKOS OR THE QUEERS,

OR THAT CRAP
THEY FEED YOU.

HELL, ALL THAT SHIT
MADE THE DAY INTERESTING.

ITâ€™S WHEN THE WARDEN...

ITâ€™S WHEN THE WARDEN
CALLS LIGHTS,

AND YOUâ€™RE LAYIN' THERE
IN THE DARK,

JUST YOU AND YOURSELF.

YOUR EYES
START TO ADJUST.

YOU CAN MAKE OUT
EVERY CRACK IN THE CONCRETE,

EVERY PAINT CHIP.

EVERY SHADOW.

AND YOU RECOGNIZE IT ALL.

â€™CAUSE IT WAS THE SAME
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

AND ITâ€™S GONNA BE THE SAME
EACH AND EVERY NIGHT TO COME.

FOUR WALLS.

SO YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES,

AND TRY TO IMAGINE
SOME FIRM-ASS CHICK

DOINâ€™ THE RHUMBA
ON YOUR FACE,

JUST TO GET A HARD-ON.

BUT PRETTY SOON,
THAT DONâ€™T EVEN WORK.

SO YOU START THINKINâ€™
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY,

OR YOUR FRIENDS.

AND YOU HOPE THAT GOD
CAN READ YOUR MIND.

THEN ONE NIGHT,
YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES,

AND THERE AINâ€™T
NOTHINâ€™ THERE.

JUST A SEA OF BLACK.

CANâ€™T PICTURE A SINGLE
GODDAMN THING.

YOU JUST LOOK OUT
AT ALL THAT BLACK,

AND YOU WONDER IF THATâ€™S ALL
THAT THERE IS LEFT.

THAT WAS SIX MONTHS.

[rifle cocks]

OKAY, MAN.

[rifle cocks]
READY FOR THIS?

YEAH.
LETâ€™S GO.

GO TO YOUR BROTHER.

WHAT?

LOOK, CARRIE,
YOU SHOULDNâ€™T HAVE TO DO THIS.

DANNY, THOSE ARENâ€™T
FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS OUT THERE.

AND FOR ONCE,
Iâ€™M NOT IN THE STANDS,

OR SERVING BARBECUE
TO SOME HICK,

OR WAITING FOR YOU TO GIVE ME
TWO PRECIOUS HOURS

IN THE BACKSEAT OF MY CAR.

YOU CANâ€™T DO THIS WITHOUT ME.

AND Iâ€™M GLAD.

SURE ABOUT THIS?

ITâ€™S THE BEST COVER WE GOT.

WITHOUT THE MOON,
YOU CANâ€™T SEE

YOUR HANDS IN FRONT
OF YOUR FACE OUT THERE.

WE SHOULD BE OUT OF THIS COVE
BEFORE THEY GET A CALL THROUGH.

HEY, THIS SHOULD BE
A TURKEY SHOOT.

YEAH, AS LONG AS THE TURKEYS
DONâ€™T SHOOT BACK.

WELL, LETâ€™S JUST DO IT
BEFORE THEY TRY

SOME SWAT BULLSHIT
THEY SAW ON TV.

HEY.

NOW, THINGS DONâ€™T ALWAYS HAPPEN
THE WAY YOU THINK THEY WILL.

OKAY?

IF WEâ€™RE REAL QUIET,
MAYBE THEYâ€™LL FORGET
WEâ€™RE OUT HERE.

THAT THE IDEA?

[gun cocks]

DANNY.
THIS IS DESPERATE.

HOW FAR DO YOU THINK
YOUâ€™RE GONNA GET?

CARRIE, WILL YOU TALK TO HIM?

I GOT HIM, EMERSON.
Yâ€™ALL STAY COOL.

I DONâ€™T TRUST NONE OF YOU
WITH THIS SHOT.

WHERE THE HELL ARE...

[glass shattering]

WHEREâ€™D THAT COME FROM?

STAY DOWN! HOLD YOUR FIRE.
DO NOT RETURN FIRE.

[screams]

YOU WANT US
TO JUST SIT HERE?

THEYâ€™RE SHOOTIN'
AT THE DAMN HEADLIGHTS.



HEY, HOLD IT, NOW!

AARON, DONâ€™T RUN!

DANNY!
NO!


[screams]

DANNY, NO!

[grunts]

HOLD IT!
HOLD YOUR DAMN FIRE!

STAND DOWN!

COME ON, COME ON, COME ON!
GO, GO, GO!

BOYS!
HOLD IT!

DONâ€™T RUN!

HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

[cries out]

SHANE!

SHANE!

NO.

GO!

GO, COME ON, CARRIE, GO!

CARRIE, DONâ€™T!

CARRIE, STOP THE TRUCK!

GRAB MY HAND!
REACH!

OH!

TAZ!

[moans]

[brakes squeal]

[engine grinding]

[crying]

GO!

GO!

GO!

GO!

[weeping]

[moans]

[sobbing]

[rain pattering]



OH, GOD.

HONEY.

[weeping]

[bird squawking]

[sirens wailing]

MAâ€™AM, PLEASE REMAIN
IN THE VEHICLE.

STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

HE LET ME GO.
