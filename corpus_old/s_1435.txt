Ah, I see it!

Afternoon officer.
Sorry I'm late

Who the hell are you?

Show me your pass

Oh, the pass?
I must've dropped it

No pass?

Out of the truck

Oh, yes, that is...
Where'd I put it?

What are you doing?
Get out!

Right! The pass

I'm out!
Whatcha gonna do about it?

Son of a bitch!

Get on!

Hurry!

Wait! Stop your pursuit!

Let's party!

I'm told there was a robbery

And what were you doing?

While these vermin broke
in and stole things?

How could I protect
something that

I had no knowledge
even existed?

You are full of excuses
and no results

If I trusted you,
I wouldn't be here

The target changed course
towards Bay Area 2

As soon as the destination
is confirmed,

I want you to clean out
the whole place

What's with the ruckus?

I thought I told those
Hot Dogs to keep quiet

Perhaps they scored big today

You're not thinking about
the glider, are you?

I'm just fixing it, that's all

Flying that into ECOBAN
is asking to get killed

Don't worry. I like living

ECOBAN is up to something

They keep trucking
something into Marr

They're probably trying to
torch all of Marr

The DELOS system needs resources,

so they'll burn and
pollute the whole area

You're sure you're not
planning anything stupid?

Are you saying
there's another way?

We need someone who can get to

the DELOS center without
raising suspicion

You want to use Jay?

Might as well wait until they
torch Marr to the ground

Then forget about it!

There're more where it came from

So you got something this time

Wow, what is it?

What the hell is it?

What's this blinking?

You idiots!

Freeze!
Throw down your weapons!

On the floor!
Hands on the back!

Move

Get away!

Don't make a sound!

No matter what,
don't come out!

Perfect time to
run out of ammo!

I'll cross first

Watch and learn!

Check this out!

Moe!

Easier said than done!

Sons of bitches!
Moe, I'm coming!

Zed!

Zed!

W-Woody, it's freezing

I'll go and get Shua

Don't leave me.
I'm scared

Don't be scared

I'm cold
I'll be back soon

Don't leave me

Don't worry. I'll come back

And don't sing, okay?

Hush!

Hands on the wall!

One step back!

Take them out,
and comb the building!

Yes, sir

Where's Karen?

Woody?

Oh my...

Let's go out

I can't

Woody told me to wait

Why won't you die

you little cockroach!

Get up!
I'll finish you off this time!

You should be thanking me
for taking the fall for you

You should have died then

for the sake of ECOBAN!

You mean, so Jay won't
know the truth

That's right! Good for you

Now you'll have to die again
for Jay's sake, and mine!

Shua...

Woody!

Woody!

Move! Get out of the way!

I thought it was me
looking after him,

but it was the other way around

I wanted to show
him the blue sky

I'm Sorry, Zed

I'm going to ECOBAN

You don't have to come
if you don't want to

Thank you everyone

First, we need Noah's help

The Hot Dogs are now crushed,

but, Dr. Noah and
his agent remain at large

They're conspiring to bring
about ECOBAN's downfall

Let's not blame security

and waste any more time

Operation Marr is ready

With your approval,
it can proceed immediately

Expediency would be prudent

We can no longer
coexist with the Marrians

And if energy levels
fall any further,

many ECOBAN systems
will malfunction

Making it much harder to
suppress the Marrian riots

Moreover, Dr. Noah and his agent are
probably already preparing something

We must eliminate
the root of the problem

It's our duty to protect ECOBAN

The only thing endangering
ECOBAN is ECOBAN itself

I don't care anymore

By tomorrow all of Marr
will be gone,

including Shua

Even they have a right
to protect themselves

Where are you going?

Jay!

Jay!

As long as we don't give up,

he won't give up either

I'm sick of
this bleak desolate future

I just want a sky
filled with light

Like that day so long ago

Which is why I have to go

I don't know where I'll be

But know you're with
me in my heart

Take care of Woody

All troops are assembled!

All troops are to enforce
internal security

Man your posts,
stay alert, and report

any suspicious
activity immediately!

Who diverted the troops
from Operation Marr?

Commander Cade, sir

I was ordered to
reinforce security

Where is he?

He went to the DELOS Tower, sir

What?

Send the troops to Marr.
That's an order!

Yes, sir

Battalion, on the truck!

This war won't end until
we shut down the DELOS system

You must disconnect the power supply...

before Shua puts
the spics in the system

That's your job

There! See it?

Ready!

Fire!

Governor, Operation Marr
is now underway

I wish you luck

I'll do my best, sir

That way!

Hey, hey, aren't
we going too fast?

All the sooner that
we get to pay them back!

What's the? What happened?

There's a gap! Shit!

That old man...

Hey! Stop!

He said go full speed!

Damn! I must be invincible
to have survived that!

I must have a guardian angel
and the devil's own luck!

Shua! Want a lift?

Hurry!

You guys are screwed
once I cut the power!

So you finally made it

You deserve what you'll get

This is for the good of
both Marr and ECOBAN

ECOBAN?

You're ruining
everyone's future!

You're ruining
my future with Jay!

Why you?
Why should only you have her?

No!

Jay, no!

Don't make me do this to you

Jay!

Grandpa, I see something bright!

That's right. That's right
