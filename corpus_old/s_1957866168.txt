Benji, watch!

This is how the pros do it.

Hey. Stop, I was joking!

Don't do it. Nate!
Come on.

[muffled sound]

Whoo! Yeah!

[Claire] Annabelle?
[Annabelle] Yeah.

Can you get them, sweetheart?

I wanna make sure

Chairs are done.
[Claire] All of 'em?

-Yeah
-Thank you, Benji.

[brakes squeal]

[music playing from radio]

[Travis] Just two?
[Nate] Yo, what's up?

We forgot to get towels.

Where you going?

The lake.
We're gonna rent a boat.

That's a... That's a great idea.

[Nate] Great idea.
No. No, no, no, no.

Nate, we want to go alone.

Travis is only gonna be here
for a few days.

Well, you don't know
how to drive a boat.


Mom, can you tell him, please?

Oh, honey,
this is not my action item.

Y'all are old enough.

I don't have to referee
for you anymore, okay?

But your brother's
only gonna be here

for a couple more weeks,

and then he goes off to college.

So... don't you want to have
some quality time with him?


I've been with him all summer.

let me tell it to you.

I've got 14 people
coming for dinner.

I have not even started
the fried chicken yet,

your dad is not back yet
to help me with the fireworks,

and if you're gonna stay here,
you're gonna work.

But otherwise, go on to the lake
and have a good time

and get out of my hair.
Okay? You guys work it out.

Katy, come on,
it's not a big deal.

The more, the merrier.

Fine, but you're not driving.

Well, can I come?


Fine.

I'll just stay here
and day drink with Grandma.

You always were my favorite.

okay?

The guests are coming,
your dad'll be back.

[truck engine revs]

[Benji] Whoo!
[Nate] Yeah!

What the hell? I love that boy.

[music concludes]

[indistinct chatter]

[door squeaks]

[Benji] Yo.
Yo.

dude?

Man, I was, uh, busy.

Also, did you get any...
Wait for me, wait for me, okay?



Hi.

Hi.

[Nate] Hi.
[chuckles]

Hey, did they card you?
Got a fake ID, Benny.


it's Benji with a J.


Out to lake. Chill on the boat.
Oh, good for you.

We got room if you wanna come.

Hmm. Pass.

I do not do summer people.

Is that right?

You know, I'm a local.

Local, you say? Local, okay.
Yeah, well, that's too bad.

I mean, we're gonna break out
the main yacht today.

We're gonna land the chopper
right on the poop deck.

[chuckles] What?
No, I'm kidding.

We're just gonna
drink some beers

and do a little tubing.

Come on.

Sure you don't wanna come?

I don't even know who you are.

I'm Nate.

Hey, who does this?

Kid's an animal.

Wait, where is he?

He gets easily distracted.


Let go!
Hurry up!

Come on!

What are you dreaming about?

how you just quit your job

[Mama Blanche] Yeah.
Nate, come on up!

[breathes shakily]


They're canceling your flight?
[Dan] <i>No, not yet.</i>

[Claire] Well, can you ask 'em?
[Dan] <i>Well, I have.</i>

There's a million other people
wondering the same thing.

Well, this sucks.

'Cause people
are just getting ready to arrive

<i>and I've spent all afternoon

Honey, there's a line
of thunderstorms.

There's nothing I can do.
It's just nature.

There were three other firms
looking at this project, honey.

If I wasn't here,
we'd never have a shot at it.

I know. I'm just...

I'm just frustrated, sweetheart,
that's all.

[line beeps]
Hello? [sighs]

[announcer speaking indistinctly
over PA]

Dad?
[Claire] Yeah.

They're diverting his flight
out of Atlanta

'cause of the thunderstorms
everything,

but he said to go ahead
and start without him.

[sighs]
Sweetheart.

Are you okay?
My head hurts like, um...

a lot.

Oh, you're fine, you're fine.

Just get some Aspirin,
get a lot of water, okay?

'Cause I'm gonna need you
to bring the chicken down.

Mama, guests are arriving.
Hello!

Happy 4th.

[Mama Blanche] Dear God,
you might not remember me,

but here I am.

Bless this food
and bless this family,

and most of these friends here.

Bless our country,

and happy birthday to us
and all that business.

And also, if you could light
a fire under Marvin over at CVS,

that would be great.

'Cause my prescription
still isn't ready

and my arthritis is killing me.
[guests chuckle]

[thunder rumbles]

[Mama Blanche] Thank you.

See, at least somebody

is listening to me around here.
Amen.


[guests chuckling]

All right. Bon appÃ©titty,
as they say in France.


[rain pattering]

Dammit.
[thunder rumbles]

I thought that we were
gonna make it before the rain,

but looks like not.
So, everybody grab your plates.

Plan B, anything, just carry it.

Let's go inside, okay.

Grab your plate now.
[thunder rumbling]

[high pitched ringing]

Nate, come on, honey.

If you don't feel good,
you can lay down,

but grab your plate, come on.
Yeah, okay.

[quiet music playing]


Oh, I can't wait
to dip into that cake.

Canasta, that works...
No, no, no, no.

You can't do that.
What?

[breathes heavily]

[quiet music playing]


[breathes heavily]

Mom!

Mom!
Something's wrong with Nate.

What?

[breathes heavily]

Oh, my God.

Nate. Oh, my God, what's wrong?

Come here, come here.
What is wrong?

[breathes heavily]
Breathe.

Honey, just breathe. Katy!
[Katy] Mom.

Breathe. Katy!
[Katy] Mom, what is it?

Yes. Honey, get my car,
bring it round front.

Katy, go!

Go! I know what I'm doing. Go.

[Nate groans]
I got you, baby, just breathe.

Breathe. I got you, I got you.
Just breathe.

Oh, my God, please, please,
please. Just breathe.

Trust me. It's okay.
I've got you.

Please, dear God.
Please, dear God.

Oh, my God, please, dear God.

[music swells]


Help!

Hello!

[music fades]

Why did he need the catheter?

[Dr. Patidar]
It's for the urine screen.

I already told you,
he is not on drugs.

I just want to know that my son
is going to be okay.

Ma'am, I understand.

We're gonna take him
for a CT scan.

We should know something soon.

Wait...

your dad for half an hour.

He doesn't answer.

[breathes deeply]
Why doesn't he answer?

[indistinct chatter]

[cell phone chimes]

[cell phone chimes]

[cell phone chimes rapidly]

I'm concerned about the scan.

There's swelling
around the brain

and I don't know why.

I'd like
to do a lumbar puncture.

What is that?
[Dr. Patidar] A spinal tap.

To check for signs
of a possible infection.

And... you want to do that here?

Uh, yeah, it won't take long

but I need you all
to wait outside.

Katy, we're not doing
anything else here.

Uh, I want to go home.
[Dr. Patidar] Mrs. Gibson.

I'm wanna go back to Nashville.

I wanna go
to St Celine Hospital.

that's like a five-hour drive.

We're not driving, honey, we...

I want an airplane
or a helicopter,

or whatever it is that's gonna
get him there the fastest, okay?

And I want it...
Start dialing! I want it now!

I need to drive two hundred
and eleven miles

to Nashville, Tennessee.

I need a car,
and I need it right now.

[helicopter blades whirring]

This is a medical emergency.

My son has been
in a horrific accident.

He's being
Life Flighted right now

to the hospital.

I don't even know how he is.

I'm so sorry.

If you had a reservation
maybe I could...

How am I supposed
to have a reservation?

I'm not even supposed
to be here!

Sir.

Excuse me
just for one second, please.

Sir.
Please, please,

just one minute, please.
Take my reservation.

It's economy,

probably a little crappy Kia
or something,

but it'll get you there.

And, uh... I'm sorry
to hear about your son.

[dramatic music playing]

[helicopter blades whirring]

[helicopter blades whirring]

Mom? I'm Doctor Clark.
I'm the chief neurosurgeon ITU.

We got him now.

[monitor beeping]

[quiet music playing]

[music continues]

Hello.

Are you the father?

[Nate gasping, spluttering]

[music fades]
[monitor beeping]

[Nate groans, breathes heavily]

[Dr. Clark]
What's presenting is meningitis.

We think it probably came
from the water in the lake.

When you dive or jump,

germs can blast into the sinuses
and then the bloodstream

before inflaming the brain.

what's causing the seizures?

I know it's hard to watch,

but we're doing the best we can.

How do you treat this?
[Dr. Clark] Priority one

is to reduce
the swelling around his brain

and maintain his blood pressure.

We're treating with antibiotics

until we know more.

And how long does that take?

Anywhere from 28 to 48 hours.

He could be like this
for two more days?

Most likely.
[Claire] Wait.

Why isn't anyone saying?

Excuse me?

Why isn't anyone saying?

Is Nate going to be okay?

Your son is very sick.

We're doing all we can,
but you should know,

mortality rates
in his age and profile

are 80 percent.

[Dan] Oh, God.
[Dr. Steinberg] If he survives,

there's also a significant risk
of brain impairment.

Loss of speech, loss of hearing,

cognitive dysfunction.

Even paralysis.

[monitor beeping]

[siren wailing distantly]
[pen tapping]

Why?


[clipboard clatters]

I can't do this.


Look,
remember what the doctor said.


We should be prepared
for all possible outcomes.

Right?
I can't.

in three days' time,

he wakes up
and he's perfectly normal?


Nate Gibson has never been
completely normal.

Yeah.

He's a funny little kid.

You remember the time

he took that little red wagon
of his,

loaded it up
with all my clothes,

wheeled it around the lake,

and tried to sell it
to all my friends?

I mean, that kid is just...

Dan... [sobs]

I'm so scared.

Me too.

is these...

horrible thoughts I keep having.


Yeah. [inhales]


[sobs]
[Dan] It's okay.

[Dan kisses] It's okay.
[sobs]


Let it go.
[Claire sobs]

I'm right here.
[Claire sobs]

We'll get through this.

[Claire sobs]

We'll get through it.

[Claire sobbing]



[monitor beeping]

So, do not leave, Nathaniel.

You do not have my permission.

You understand?

Nate?

[man] Hi.
[Claire] Hey.


Thank you. It's amazing.

How are you doing, Nate?
You excited?

Yeah. Hell yeah, I'm excited.
Yeah?

[dogs barking]

[indistinct chatter]

Your husband couldn't make it?

with my mother.

And is everything okay?


Claire, we talked about this.
I mean, you're taking on a lot,

and if Dan's having
second thoughts...

No. No, he's not. He's not.

He knows that
this is what Nate wants, and...

everything will be fine,
I promise.

Nate, come on.

Now, remember
what we talked about

in the home visit.
[pig snorts]

That you're gonna go in first.

Frank's gonna be sitting
at the table

and we're just gonna

give Gigi a little time
to acclimate to you.

[Nate] Okay.
[Carolyn] Okay?


There she is.

[chitters softly]

Hey, Gigi.


this is her first placement.

She has had years of training,

but it takes a little while
for her to establish a bond.

peanut butter?

It helps with the training.

[blows raspberry]

I don't think she likes you.

No, she likes me.
She... [chuckles]

She just doesn't know it yet.

[squeaks]
[laughs]

So cute.

Where did you get her
from again?

A petting zoo in California.

It was more
like a traveling circus.

They didn't treat her so well.

Well, that is about to change.

Ready?

Yeah.

All right, let's go in slow

so she gets used to you,

and kind of circle around.

Okay?

You guys can stay with me here,

so we give them a little space.
[squeaks]

[chitters]
[wheelchair whirring]

How you doing?

[Gigi squeaks]

Sorry we're late.

It was...
it was crazy out there.

[hoots softly]

Yeah, I know you're supposed
to allow 15 minutes

to account for traffic, but...

it takes me a little while
to get ready these days.


[chuckles softly]
[Gigi squeaks]

I haven't...

seen him smile

in months.


Hey.
[squeaks]

Hi.



[uplifting music playing]

[Nate] Oh, Dad's waiting.
[Claire laughs]

Okay.

Did you take care of the dog?
Yes, he's behind the gate.

And is the monkey cage ready?

Yes, we're all set.
[Claire] Okay. [chuckles]

[Nate] I'm good. I got it.
Good?

[Nate] Yeah.
All right.

Monkey in the house, people!

Oh, lucky us.

How you doing?

Good. I got a passenger here.

[Dan] I... I can see.
[Claire chuckles]

[squeaks, chitters]

She's a lot smaller
than I thought.

This is Father. He likes beer.

[shushes]
[Dan] You should let her out.

to his room.

She has to imprint
the environment first.

[dog barks]

This is Banjo.

He likes barking.

[Gigi chittering]

[Banjo barking]

[Gigi squeaking]
Ah.

[Mama Blanche] Get used to it.

This is a crazy town
around here.

Here we go.

And you're in.

[music concludes]

This is it.

This is where you're gonna live.

[squeaks, chitters]


I sit in it
when they need to move me

'cause I'm really heavy.

And these...
these are my paintings.

This is where
I do my physical therapy.

AKA weakly torture. [chuckles]

It's pretty boring, but it's not
like I can go to the gym, right?

And over here...

This is your house.

[squeaks, chitters]


You know, chill for a while?
[squeaks, chitters]


You ready?

[gasps, chuckles]

[Banjo barking in distance]

they call it monkey college.

They train for like five years

before they can
come to the house.


She's great. She's hanging out
in her cage right now.

Annabelle.
Come help with the dishes.

Top left!

[Nate] Take him out!
[Claire] Has she come out?

Uh-uh.

Like I said, you just ignore her
and do your own thing, okay?

I mean,
she has to learn your routine.

Does she bite?

[screeches]
Oh, no.


<i>What's she wearing?</i>

[Nate chuckles]
She's wearing scrubs.

Benjamin.

Bye, Benji.

you were just watching. Come on.


Come on, you're okay.

Okay.

Hello, happy family.

I thought you had classes

I'm a senior.
Nobody goes to class anymore.


I have Mock Trial tomorrow
I'm just taking a break.

For the record,
none of this is mine.

And her sheets are disgusting.

Hey.
Hi, Nana.


[Katy sighs]

Where's Dad?

[Katy opens can]
He had to work late.

[Banjo barks]
Since when?

Since the monkey moved in.


What monkey?

[Banjo barking]

Nate got a pet monkey.

Katy, I was gonna tell you

that we have decided
that what we...

No. Mom, you said

that you were
just thinking about it.

[Banjo barking]
She's not a pet,

she's a service animal.
Right.

You can't keep
a freaking monkey in the house.

Says who?
You don't live here anymore.

Where is it?

Katy!

Katy, there is a protocol
to all this

and you are not supposed
to just go up there.

You're gonna freak her out.

Katy, are you listening?

Oh, my God.
[Claire] Never mind.

You keep her in a cage?

It's not a cage,

It's her house. She likes it.

Hi.

Hi.
[hoots]

No, you're not.

if I were you.

[chitters, screeches]

[Annabelle chuckles, gasps]

Look! See, you don't disturb her
when she's eating.

Basic Monkey 101. [chuckles]

[groans] It went in my mouth.
Oh, my God! [laughs]

I told you not to do that.

I'll get it. It's okay.
Come here.

What is wrong with you people?
Monkeys are primates.

They're supposed
to be in the wild,

not kept in cages.

She is not here for you.

Nate doesn't need
his own monkey slave.

Travis, can you tell them?

You know that I'm right.
I'm Switzerland here.

[Annabelle laughs]
Smart lawyer. Very smart.

Okay. Mom, this is cruel.

[Annabelle] Come on.
[Katy] It's inhumane, crazy...

I'm not gonna be a part of it.

a little ridiculous, Claire.

We got a junior in high school,
we got a son in a wheelchair,

we got your eighty-year-old
mother here,

and you wanna bring a monkey
into the mix?

And train it, and feed it,
and clean up

after it tears the house apart?

I thought
you were on board with this.

I was. I am.


to come home and relax

at the end of a long week,
that's all.

Great. Fine. Go relax.

Not like you ever help me out
with anything anyway.

Okay. [sighs]

What's going on?
Come on.

When is the last time that you

got up at three in the morning
to turn Nate?

Claire, I work. How do you think
we pay for our health insurance?

Yeah. Why? You can't get up,
I don't know, maybe once a week

to help me out?



you'd understand it.

It just doesn't pay!

you're the only one

who makes sacrifices
around here?

What else do you want, Dan, huh?

You want your perfect life back.

You want your perfect son back.

And your
country club membership,

and your house on the lake.

You were the one
that sold Happy Days.

Because I had to.

How else were we gonna afford
Nate's bedroom?

You know what? We had plenty
of money when you were working.


go back to the studio?

Do some cleaning...
I don't have any time!

I take care of Nate
day and night.


Claire,
you can't fix everything!

I mean, if you think
that this monkey's

gonna be some magic bullet
that's gonna

get Nate out of that wheelchair
and walk again,

you are wrong!

[Gigi chitters]

You wanna get rid of Gigi?

No, I didn't say that. Cla...
No, no, it's okay. Come on.

Now don't get this way with me.
But you tell him. You be the..

Claire...
Go on up there!

And you tell Nate,
"I'm here to take away

the one good thing
that's happened to you

in the last four years"!

Claire.

Dad's right.

What?

We should take Gigi back.
It's too much.

No, it's not. Your... your dad
and I were just venting, honey.

Everything's gonna be all right.

You sold Happy Days
because of me.

You haven't...

painted or sculpted in years
'cause of me.

I don't want
to be more of a burden

than I already am.

you are not a burden, okay?

I am your mother.

There will never be a time...
Oh, Mom, stop. Mom! Get off me!

I just wanna sleep.

It's the only time
I don't have to think about it.

[door closing]

Uh, can you please let her know

that I will be at this number
all day.

Okay. Thank you.

Was that Cebus?

Mm-hmm.

[soft music playing]

one at a time.

[Nate groans]
Has anybody said anything?

About what?

aren't into having, uh,

monkeys being used
as service animals.

[Nate groans softly]

We're taking her back anyway.


It's, um...

you know,
it's just not working out.



Backing it up. Thumb.
[Nate groans]

[Nate groans]

Oh, man.
[Jay] That was good.

Just open up some extension,
all right?

[Nate] Okay. All right.
Okay. So, I'll start over.

[Nate] Yeah.

How's your pain these days?

It's there.

Is the gabapentin helping?

[chuckles]
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

[Nate] It's okay.
No, it's not. It's not okay.

That's like the worst thing I've
ever said in my entire life.

I am so sorry. I really didn't...
I didn't mean to...

Her. And, uh, no, sorry,
I'm not supposed to let you.

Why, does she...
Does she bite or something?

No, no, she's...
She's super friendly.

But, uh, it's just kinda
what I have to do.

Although, uh...

she likes fruit.

Like a lot.

So, uh, you got
any blueberries lying around?

Uh, yeah. Yeah, for sure.
Um, one second.

You better eat right now.

I'm a senior at Belmont.

I'm sorry, can I get a picture?


[Nate] Hey, smile.

[chuckles] Ah, that's awesome.

'Cause I totally
have to post this,

so what's your, uh,
what's your handle?

You know, now I have to say it
out loud,

it's kind of embarrassing,
but, uh..

"Its the monkey guy."

[chuckles]
[Nate chuckles] Yeah.

No, it's, it's cute.

[chuckles]
[Lori] All right.

I love it. All right. Um...

Uh, I...

I have to get back to work,
but, um...

it was really nice
to see you, Nate.

Yeah, you, too.

We should, um,
we should hang out sometime.

Yeah, that... that could be cool.

Um... All right. Bye.
All right. [chuckles]

Bye.

Nice job, Gigi. [chuckles]

You know that girl?

Yeah, yeah. Her name's Lori.

Young man? Young man.

Hi.

Hi. Is that your monkey?

Yeah. This is Gigi.

You wanna get a picture?
He can't be in here.

Excuse me?
It's against the law.

it's not.

This is a service animal
for my son.

Service animals are only allowed

in places
of public accommodation.

That doesn't
include grocery stores.

Thank you very much.
But we come here all the time.

It's not sanitary.

Monkeys carry diseases
and it's a public health risk.

You could
get everybody in here sick.


Mom, forget about it.

Okay, we were just leaving.
No, I won't forget about it.

We have every right to be here.
Not with that monkey.

Should I get the manager?

Got this from the manager.

Now, he says he didn't even know
y'all were there.

Then what
is he complaining about?

Yeah.
[Sgt. Ellis] Well, he's not.

Call we got

came from this lady here.

Y'all ever heard of Americans
For Animal Protection?

Mm-mm.
Um, vaguely.

That there is Chloe Gaines,
Tennessee chapter president.

Wait, you know her?
[Sgt. Ellis] Oh, yeah.

Everyone in Animal Control does.

Chloe's the reason
you can't keep live chickens

in Davidson County anymore.

Or snakes, or exotic birds.

There's a whole long list. Now...

[overlapping clamor]

I can't get anything
off the shelves without her.

Guys. Officer, I'll take it.
This is on me.

Um, Officer,

Gigi is a service animal,

so we all thought that we could
just bring her anywhere.

Well, you can, except...

for grocery stores,
or restaurants.

Basically,
anything around food handling.

Okay, got it. Now we know.
Never happen again.

Mm. Yeah.

So... [sighs]

I've seen the animal.

ID'd the owner.

Investigated the environment.

Nothing inhumane or unsanitary
going on around here, right?

Come back for dinner.

but trust me,

it's not worth
picking a fight over.

Just please, next time,
leave Gigi at home.

She's a busybody.

And I wanted to punch her
right in her botoxed face.

and then Nate, uh,

his exercise balls
are right over here, okay?

Yeah, watch out, on your left.
You got them right here.

And then here's his schedule.

Annabelle, she has a sleepover
right after school.

Then Nogo's coming in at 5:30,
just a little bit early.

Katy promised she'd be here
no later than ten o'clock.

Here are all of Nate's meds.

Oh, don't forget he has to
recline at two o'clock,

then again at four o'clock.

And here are
the emergency medical numbers

just in case you need them.
Claire, I get it.

I've raised two kids.
But we weren't special needs.

Hmm. Debatable.

Mama. Okay, here are the numbers

of where we're gonna be,
all right?

My cell phone number...

Mom, nothing is gonna happen.
Okay?

You got Dan's cell phone number,
okay?

You just call us
and we will come right back.

My mom's gone crazy.
Any questions?

When are you gonna leave?

This is the longest goodbye
in history. [chuckles]

Mama, it is a five-hour window
until Nogo gets here,

so I just wanna make sure
you can handle it.

I can handle it.
[Claire] Okay.

Goodbye, sweetheart. I love you.

All right.

It's gonna be fine, okay?
Dad's gonna be surprised.

Go have fun. I love you.

like I have a responsibility

that you won't be okay.

Okay.

First of all, that's insane.

Second of all,

since when have you
ever taken care of me?

[Katy] Yeah, that's my point.
Ever. [laughs]

And I went
through the whole thing

being so selfish,

and self-centered,
and I fully admit that.

But I'm older now.

I... I feel like it's my turn.

What turn? There is no turn.

I'm being serious.
So am I.

You can't change your life
because of me.

You don't think I...

already feel like a burden
all of the time?

It's not a burden. I just...
I wanna be here if you need me.

Because.

You already gave me
what I needed.

I was lying in the bed.

It was cold,
there were all these nurses.

[protestors] A-F-A-P! AFAP!

What the hell's going on?

Exercising our right
to peaceful protest.

let me tell you something.

I've got an eighty-year-old
mother inside,

I've got a disabled child,
a 17-year-old daughter.

This is disturbing.

You guys need to back up
and go home.

This is a public sidewalk.

[tires screech]

I remember you.

I remember you from the store.

Chloe, right?

[protestors cheer]

If you've got an issue,

why don't you just talk to me
like an adult?

Excuse me, please.
[crowd chanting] <i>Shame! Shame!</i>

I am recording this.

And I am calling the police.

[dramatic music playing]

<i>Shame, shame, shame!</i>

[chanting echoes]

Katy!

Oh.

[protestors clamoring, chanting]

Mom, are you okay?

Katy, call the police.

Katy, call the... Go, go, go!

<i>Shame, shame, shame!</i>

<i>Shame, shame, shame!</i>

What the hell is...?

[car horn honking]


Hey!

I work here. Oh my God. Stop!

[car engine revs]
[tires screech]

[pants]
[tires screech]

Come on, are you okay?
Yeah. Jesus.

[protestors chanting]
<i>Shame! Shame! Shame!</i>

You people are insane!

What's going on?

Well, Nate went to a party
last night, took Gigi.

What?
Yes. And the video went viral.

[Nogo] Oh, my God.
Now we've got AFAP on our hands

and we've got all these...
Mama, what are you doing?

[Mama Blanche]
Protecting your property.

You're disgusting!

Sidewalk only. Not on our lawn.

Mom.
You hear me?

You wanna take my picture?
Cheese.

You wanna take my picture?
Cheese.

[quiet music playing]

[Carolyn] I can't believe this.
[Claire] I know.

I know. It's pretty bad.

So, you said
there was gonna be a hearing?

Yeah.
When?

Two days.

These people are very powerful,
and they've been lobbying

to change
the service animal laws

for years

and Tennessee
was always on their list.

Change them how?

By making capuchins illegal.

They've already done it
in Kansas and Florida.

And now, with all this...

What, you're saying they're
doing this because of me?

They see an opportunity, Nate.

All we did
was take her to a stupid party.

It's not like she hurt anybody.

I know, but it's not about that.

Look, once Animal Control
gets involved,

it changes things.

There's a lot of people

that don't agree
with what we do.

Okay, so what happens
if they change the law?

You guys, what,
you're gonna take Gigi away

and I'm never gonna
see her again?

[wheelchair whirring]

[dramatic music playing]

[reporter 1] And after several
complaints to Animal Control

involving a local man
and his monkey helper,

the legislature is scheduled
to take up the issue tomorrow.

[reporter 2 over laptop] <i>Today,
in Nashville news, public outcry</i>

<i>after a young man
brought his service monkey</i>

<i>to a local grocery store
and then to a college party.</i>

Meet Chloe Gaines,
long time animal activist

and member of Americans
for Animal Protection.

On a recent visit
to her local supermarket,

<i>she encountered 23-year-old
Nate Gibson</i>

<i>and his capuchin companion Gigi.</i>

[reporter 4 over TV] <i>And finally</i>
<i>tonight,</i>

<i>the tale of a Tennessee man
and his capuchin monkey</i>

<i>that went viral
over the weekend.</i>

<i>It's re-igniting the debate
over what constitutes</i>

<i>a service animal
in this country.</i>

[doorbell rings]

Hi, um, Mrs. Gibson.
I'm... I'm Lori.

[chuckles softly]
I know who you are. Um...

well, uh,
Nate is just in the other room.

We weren't expecting company,
so...

Yeah, I'm not actually here
to... to talk to Nate.

[crickets chirping]

I'm... I'm so sorry.

I'm the person
that invited Nate to the party,

and... and I'm the one
who told him to bring Gigi,

so all these videos coming out,
that's kind of my fault.

And I've been watching the news
and it... it sucks.

I... I really don't wanna see
anything bad

happen to Nate or... or Gigi.

Well...

it's a little bit
too late for that.

I mean, they're already talking
about changing the law tomorrow,

so that we can't have
a service monkey.

Look, you... you have to fight.

You can't just let them do that.

And I swear to God, I'm not here
to make things worse,

but you just...
You gotta promise me

that you're gonna talk to Nate,
okay?

You're gonna tell him.

You're gonna tell him
that he just can't give up.

Look, just, please,
I... I have to go.

[footsteps receding]

[dramatic music playing]

[reporter speaking over laptop]
[Claire breathes deeply] Nate.

You are speaking
to that Committee tomorrow.

Ten a.m., Capitol building.

<i>Doesn't he have to be invited?</i>


Start writing.

[keyboard clacking]

[siren blaring]

[indistinct chatter]

What are you doing here?

Um, I'm testifying
to the Committee.

What are you going to say?

I'm gonna say the truth.

Thank you very much.

Capuchins are highly intelligent
and social.

They're among the smartest
of all the primates.

And the idea

of trying to make them
subservient to humans

is not only unnatural,
it's immoral.

Morality isn't the question.

It's whether or not they pose
a danger to the public.

Well, that goes back to the bond
with the mother

that I talked about.

When you take a baby capuchin
away at a young age,

you remove any chance they have
for normal development.

And that's a ticking time bomb.

We're not making a decision
in a vacuum, are we?

What about the well-being
of this young man here?

Don't we owe him
a duty of consideration?

Certainly, we have sympathy

for Mr. Gibson
and his situation.

We wouldn't be human
if we didn't.

But the unfortunate truth here
is that this isn't about him.

It's about
protecting the public.

Simply put,

no amount of training

can ever remove the risk
of attack by a capuchin.

And it's not their fault.

They belong in the wild
and not in our homes.

That's why we urge you
to pass this bill.

It's the right thing to do

and it's the right time
to do it.

Thank you.
[audience cheers, applauds]

[Chairman Filling] Order!

Order!

Order, please!

Next on the list is Nate Gibson.

[scattered applause]

[Nate clears throat]

My name is Nate Gibson.

Uh, I'm 23 years old.

I've been in this wheelchair
since I was 18.

When I got paralyzed,

I was six weeks away
from college.

I ran track,
and then I couldn't.

My body was a wreck.

I couldn't feed myself,
I couldn't go to the bathroom.

I had nurses take care of me
around the clock.

My mind was a wreck, too.

I actually tried to kill myself
at one point, but...

luckily my parents
were there to save me.

Though, at the time,
it did not feel so lucky.

And then one year ago,
my life completely changed.

That's when I got Gigi.

She is eight-year-old capuchin,

trained by the amazing people
at Cebus.

And they taught her
to look after me.

The only reason
I can move my arms now

is... is because of Gigi.

But that's not the best part
about her.

She gave me a reason
to wake up...

every day.

To take care of her.

To, um, pet her, play with her.

Gigi is a vital member
of our family.

She provides a service.

She allows me to live my life
to the fullest every single day.

And if the idea is to somehow
make that against the law...

well, then something is truly,
truly wrong.

Mr. Gibson, you heard
Ms. Gaines testify, correct?

Yes, Ma'am.

So, you understand our job here

is to protect the health
and safety of the public.

Do you think capuchins
are dangerous?

No.

But you can see
the same statistics we do.

Over 300 people injured
with pet monkeys

over the last 20 years
in this country.

Gigi's a service animal,
not a pet.

No different than a guide dog
for a blind person.

[Senator Parsons]
But she is different, isn't she?

She's much smarter,
isn't that right?

Yes, she... yes, she is. She...

Actually, I had to
put a password on my phone

'cause she figured out
how to order

pizza on my Domino's app.

[audience laughs]

But isn't that the problem?

We have these
highly intelligent animals

that live in groups in the wild.

We put 'em in cages,

and they become frustrated
and bored.

Then they lash out
and someone gets hurt.

Then their owners abandon them

and the state has to
deal with it.

Well, shouldn't you be going
after the owners?

It's like when
a parent abuses their kid.

You don't arrest the kid,
do you?

And... and... and Gigi
wasn't taken from her mother.

She's a rescue.

She wouldn't even be alive

if it weren't
for the people at Cebus.

I have to say,
I think it's inhumane

to let people
put these animals in cages.

Well, what about a zoo?
What about a circus?

What about a wildlife park?

Every single one of those
is legal.

[Senator Barnes]
I suspect if they get their way

we'll outlaw those, too.

That is what I don't understand.
Why do they get to say

what is right for an animal
they don't even know?

Who died and made them God?
[audience muttering]

[Chairman Filling] Order please.

Mr. Gibson.

No, like, if you wanna be vegan
or whatever,

and not wear leather,
that's fine. It's your choice.

But you do not have the right
to make that choice for me.

It's not fair.

I think
we're getting off track here.

The law already bans gorillas,

orangutans, chimps, and gibbons.

The question is

whether to expand it
to include all primates.

Excuse me, Ma'am.
Yes, I have read the statute.

It says you can't own

inherently dangerous animals.

Lions, tigers, hippos, bears.

[soft music playing]

I get that. Their instinct
is to hunt and to kill.

You know
what Gigi's instinct is?

It's... It's to help.

It's to scratch an itch
I can't reach, or to, um...

turn the pages of a book
that I'm reading, or... or, uh,

turn the TV off when she thinks
I'm watching too much.

She's not some screen
that I stare at, or some robot

that I order around
to do things for me.

She's... She's a...
She is a living, breathing...

creature who has value.

She... she has rights,
she has thoughts.

She's far more similar to us
than we think.

Um...

I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for her.

I wouldn't.

And you were right earlier
when you said it's not about me.

Like, it's... it's not. It's
about something much bigger.

It's about our connection,
it's about our interaction,

it's about our evolution.


[indistinct chatter]
[Annabelle] How much longer?

[camera shutters clicking]
[Dan] Oh, I don't know, honey.


Think I went on too... too long?

No, you didn't.

I've never heard most

of that stuff before
and I just...

I didn't understand.

It's okay.

You're amazing,
and I'm so proud of you.

Thanks.
[door opening]

[indistinct chatter]

[wheelchair whirring]

Two to one in favor
of advancing the bill.

[crowd cheering]

Great job.


I just wanted
to say congratulations.

I don't really know what all
just happened in there, but...

I'm sorry.

It's not personal.

Oh, yes, it is personal.

It's very personal.

And I don't want you
to ever forget that.

We will be fighting this.

We will.
We will be fighting this.

Thank you so much.
Thank you for your service.

Thank you for being here.
God bless you.

[clapping echoes]

[birds chirping]

[wheelchair whirring]

[squeaks]
[growls]


[soft music playing]
[birds chirping]

[Gigi squeaking]

Here we go.


I'm gonna miss that.


Gonna miss that a lot.

[birds chirping]

You gotta go.

Yeah, you do.

[squeaks, chitters]

[sobs softly]

I know,
but you're gonna be okay. [sobs]

Take care of yourself, Gigi.

It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be all right.

[Gigi screeching]

[music swells]

[water running]

[sobs]
[music concludes]

[sobs, sniffles]

Since when do you cry so much?

Won't do any good, you know.

You have to fix it.

[sobs] I can't.
[Mama Blanche] Sure you can.

[sobs] I can't.
[Mama Blanche] Sure you can.


What... [sniffles] You want me
to make turkey chili? [chuckles]

No. It's on the other side.


That's not gonna solve anything.


Capuchins are legal
in North Carolina.

[uplifting music plays]

You... you're frickin'
kidding me.

I can't believe it's for sale.

too bad.

It needs a little work.
I mean,

we'd have to sell the house
in Nashville to afford it,

but I think it's worth it.
Don't you?

["Wave Me On" playing]

[newsreader over radio]
<i>Hello and good afternoon.</i>

[Gigi squeaking]
<i>- Thanks for tuning in to WQDA</i>

<i>for your North Carolina news.</i>

<i>- I'm Elizabeth.</i>
[Paul] <i>And I'm Paul.</i>

<i>to celebrate</i>

<i>the 4th of July tonight,</i>

<i>- with fireworks and...</i>
[Dan talking indistinctly]


All right.

Gigi, come over.

You know, Mom, I was thinking.

Some point in your life,

you're gonna have
to stop worrying about me.

That'll be the day.

What is this?
[squeaks]

Thank you.

You're going to college?

right?


I didn't even know
you were applying.

Well, that's not the best part.

You know, I got a full ride
on tuition,

books. Gigi can come.

They have ramps and everything.
Everything's accessible.

I am so proud of you.

[Gigi squeaks]

<i>what might have happened</i>

<i>if I'd never gotten meningitis.</i>

[Dan] Dear God, thank you...
[Nate] <i>I mean...</i> [chuckles]

<i>Come on, I'm not an idiot.</i>

<i>- That would've been awesome.</i>
[Dan] Thank you for our family.

And thank you
for all the fish...

<i>I got put on...</i>

<i>I think I made the best of it.</i>

<i>As for Gigi...</i>

<i>It's funny, we thought
we were rescuing her.</i>

[all laughing]


<i>she gave us the one thing
we needed most.</i>

<i>- Hope.</i>
[all] Cheers!
