Am I Beautiful

Oh my God.

Can you believe it?

It's perfect.

We did it.


And it's all ours!

It's all ours.

I'm so lucky to have you.

Yeah. Yeah.

What do you say
we go break in the bedroom?

Oh!

Okay.

Give me a minute.

Where you going?

I'm going to rinse off.

You can wait for me in anticipation.

Whatever.

I didn't always think
you were that cute you know.

Oh?

No but you filled out nicely
since high school.

Thanks.

It's true.

Filled out nice.

Am I beautiful?

I'm sure
you are just as you should be.

Am I beautiful?

Yes.

Yes.

You are beautiful.

Am I still beautiful?

No.
