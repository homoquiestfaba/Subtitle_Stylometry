Ladies and gentlemen,

The one and only,
The emperor of comedy...

Sir Eddie Griffin

I want to fuck Michelle Obama.

I need her on my team.
I'm waiting on Obama to fuck up.

That nigga slip up,
I'ma slide right in.

What's happening, Michelle?
You like comedy?

That's some fine chocolate
motherfucker.

You understand me?
I didn't vote for Obama because of him,

I voted because of her.

This is the first first lady
that is fuckable.

'Cause you didn't want
To fuck daddy Bush's wife.

She look like she jumped off
the dollar bill.

Look at that!
That's George Washington!

And you didn't want
to fuck George Jr. 's wife.

She look like the mama
on Damien: Omen.

Every time I see her face,
all I hear is...

Look like the bitch head about
to spin around at any moment.

And I don't think you wanted
to fuck hillary either.

I don't think Hillary
like dick.

She wear more pantsuits than
a brother at a funeral.

Now here's how I know Obama
got some pimp in him.

All right?

Remember when Hillary was running against
him? She talking all that shit about obama.

Obama got the job.
He gave her a job.

That's pimpin'.

And what was the job
he gave her?

Secretary of state.

And what was the secretary
of state's job?

Stay out of the country.

He banished that bitch
to foreign lands.

And the happiest motherfucker
about it is Bill Clinton.

You know Bill at home,
"Thank you, Obama.

I can get my dick sucked
every day. "

Now I knew Obama...
I knew he had some nigga in him....

You know, 'cause at first,
you couldn't tell.

But one day,
it jumped out of him.

Y'all remember that day him and George Bush
was walking outside the White House

...and his swag was on 250?

I'm sitting at home.
I said, "that brother's a pimp. "

You could damn near hear the conversation.
"Hurry up and get your shit out my house.

"Take your punk ass back
to texas. You bitch!"

'Cause at first, I thought Obama
was an African-American.

And white people, I know y'all think
all black people the same.

We just like you white folks.
You got different kind of white folks.

You got honkies, you got crackers,
you got rednecks, you got white guys.

Black people the same way.
You got black folks.

"Just don't want
to be bothered. "

You got old negroes.
"I sure wish slavery'd come back.

Massa was so good to us. "

And you got african-americans.
"I graduated from college Cum da-lada. "

And then you have niggas.
Which I happen to be a member of.

BULLSHIT!

Translation: NIGGER!

"Pull over... "
NIGGER!

And obama, here's how I really
knew he had hood in him.

He threw a barbeque...

at the White House...

He invited the NBA, the NFL, every rapper.
I think I was the only nigga that wasn't there.

You know white people was sitting
at home, "My god! It's all over!
The niggers are barbecuing!

They're licking their fingers!

They got collard greens
and black-eyed peas. "

Here's how I really knew
He was from the hood.

He put a swing set...

I don't think y'all heard me.
He put a swing set

on the white house lawn.
That's some nigga shit!

He got enough money and power to send
his daughters to Disneyland every day.

He said, "Fuck that. Put that swing set
outside that window

So I can keep my eye
on they little ass. "

'Cause black people,
we watch our kids.

I'm talking to you,
white folks.

I'm tired of seeing y'all kids
on my milk carton.

You know, you just trying to pour
some milk on your cereal

And there's always that little white
face with he caption underneath it.
"Have you seen me?"

No, I ain't seen your little ass!
And how come your parents
don't know where the hell you at?

You ain't never seen little brothers
and sisters on a milk carton,

'cause if you did,
they'd be posing.

'Cause I remember when we was coming up-
And black people, back me up on this.

When we was coming up,
remember your parents tell you,
"You can play to the end of this block. "

Remember? That's as far as your ass go.
Ain't no going out to the woods.

And I remember my mama told me,
"If you go any further, I'ma fuck you up. "

I remember one day, me and my
partner Don Junior, we kicking it, right?

We get up to the corner.
Boom, boom.

They like, "Ed, come on.
Let's go on the next block.

Let's see what's over there. "

Boy, I was nervous.

That's when you look down to see
if your mama on the front porch.

My mama looking me
dead in the eye.

I couldn't hear her,
but her mouth said...

My uncle Bucky had his pistol. He's like,
"I can shoot your ass from here. "

I'm like "Uh, you know, uh"-...

They like, "You ain't going, Ed?" I'm like,
"Nah, man. You know, I caught a charlie horse."

You know, 'cause I ain't trying
to look like no punk, man.
"I got a horse, you know?"

They like, "Aww, you a bitch-ass nigga. "
I said, "I'll be the bitch today.

I'd rather fight both of y'all than take
one ass-whooping from her.

See ya!"

My mama beat me out of
the penitentiary.

As y'all can see,
I's free

And obviously, y'all parents whooped y'all
out the penitentiary, 'cause y'all here.

We's free!

Them two brothers I'm talking about
locked up right now.

'Cause pain give you a memory
of what not to do.

You understand me, your partner be like
"Come on, Ed, let's rob this liquor store. "

"I ain't going.
I'm cool right here. "

Now they got this
brother, Eddie Long.

Oh, don't "ooh" me. I didn't make
the shit up. Y'all seen the story.

And, you know, at first, I had to give
the brother the benefit of the doubt.

You know what I mean?
I'm like, "No. Black preachers don't
fuck little boys. "

That's the difference between a white
church and a black church.

White churches fuck your son.

Black church fuck your wife.

God gave that motherfucking
preacher the right last name. LONG.

And he tried to defend himself.
He spoke for about 35 minutes.

Not once did he say,
"I didn't do it."

All he said is, "I got five rocks
and I ain't thrown one yet. "

I said, "that's the gayest
shit I ever heard in my life. "

He didn't say, "I got five bullets.
I'm about to bust a cap. "

That guy: "I got five rocks,
and I ain't thrown one yet. "

And did you see how
he threw the mic down?

I don't go to church.

God don't live in church.
They say the body is the temple.

I'm walking to church right now.

Soon as you go to church, there's
somebody trying to stick a dick in you,
and they need some money.

Every war in humanity's
History has been over some kind of
motherfucking religion.

You know what I mean?
I don't get caught up in that bullshit

'cause I don't think God ever
wrote a Bible or a Qur'an.

He didn't have to write
no shit. He ain't no playwright.

It's written in your essence,
'cause the Bible was written by men.

The book of Peter. The book of John.
The whole book about Jesus,

but that nigga
ain't wrote one book.

The motherfucker that it's
about didn't write shit.

All the hang-outs wrote a book.
"Shit, I know the nigga, nigga. "

And you notice in each one of 'em
book, they the closest one to Jesus.

Peter like, "Me and Jesus was tight."
In John's book, "Shit, I was damn near
the nigga's daddy. You know. "

God didn't write no book.
It's written in your essence.

Nobody ever had to tell you
it's wrong to kill your mama.

Somehow you born innately
knowing that.

Which means you born knowing
right and wrong, so put the book down,
'cause it will fuck you up.

It starts out messed up
in the beginning.

In the book of genesis, "In the beginning,
there was Adam and Eve,

and Adam and Eve had two sons,
Cain and Abel.

And Cain and Abel
got married. "

To who?!

Where did these mystery bitches
come from?!

I like messing with Christians,
man.

'Cause they easy to get...

I don't believe Jesus died
on the cross.

Sacrilege!

Wait a minute, he could walk on water,
feed 1,000 with a loaf of bread...

raised the dead...

But you telling me he couldn't
handle three nails?

I know brothers with nine bullet
wounds still walking around.

His name is 50 CENT!

I bet you Jesus was
a cool kid....

His mama be like, "Now, Jesus,
go on in there and take a bath

and don't be walkin'
on your water. "

He in there...

That's probably why
they invented the shower,

just to get the nigga wet.

Look at some of the Christian
heads in here. "You going to Hell.

"Don't be talking 'bout Jesus,
Eddie. Don't be talking 'bout him. "

You know how Jesus whistle?

You know, with the hole
in the hand.

Look, y'all really like, "Nigga, that's it.
The lightning's coming. "

Christians always the first one to
want to send somebody to Hell.

"You going to Hell. "
How the fuck you know?

Like God came down. "Uh, let that
nigga know he going to Hell.

I'm kind of busy right now. "
You know what I mean?

I'm made in my heavenly
Father's image.

If I got a sense of humor,
that mean God got one.

God probably up there cracking
up right now.

"Hey, Jesus, come here!
That crazy nigga I made is on!

"He talking about you, boy.
He said you walk on your bathwater.

"He said you whistle
like this.... "

"Ah, don't get mad. That shit was funny.
It was funny. "

See, I'd be a Muslim, but the Muslim
faith, they too strict.

You know what I mean?
You can't smoke no weed.

You can't get your dick sucked
by a bitch that ain't your wife.

Matter of fact, you can't see your
wife's face until you marry her.

They keep 'em veiled up.
All you get to see is the eyes.

You really got to love
that bitch's eyes.

You be like, "Damn.
She got some pretty eyes. "

Then you marry her ass,
the veil come off.

No wonder they get 20 wives.
You playing the law of averages.

I'm telling you, I think Christians
are jealous of Muslims,

'cause you ain't gonna out-devout a Muslim.
That's the most devout faith you'll ever run into.

A Muslim will strap a bomb on they self
and blow they self up about some Muhammad.

Ask a Christian to put a bomb on
and blow they self up about Jesus.

"Naw, He wouldn't want me
to do that. "

"He just blessed me with this house.
I'm sure He wants me to live in it. "

Everybody fighting over
this religion shit. You understand me?

The Christians say Jesus is the messenger.
The Muslims say it's Muhammad.

I say, "Who gives a fuck who the messenger is?
Did you get the message?"

They got the same
damn message.

Do unto others as you would
have them do unto you.

Science proves that to be a fact.
For every action,

there's an opposite and equal reaction.

Don't fuck with me,
and I won't fuck with you.

I'll tell you somebody who needs
Jesus right around now.

Tiger Woods.

What I like about tiger,
he kept it golf. He had 18 hos.

One for every hole of golf.

Now, here's where Tiger
messed up.

Now, fellas, I want y'all to look at
the woman sitting next to you

that you brought here.
Look at her right now!

Now, you see how fine she is?

Don't ever fuck nothing
uglier than her.

You don't fuck down.
You fuck up.

You fuck a woman uglier than your
woman, she gonna be madder
than a motherfucker.

"Nigga, I know I look better than that bitch!
Nigga, what's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?"

That's when they go crazy.
"What the fuck is wrong with me?

I look better than that bitch!
What's wrong with me?"

You fuck a bitch that's finer than your
woman, she gonna act like she mad,

but she can't get mad.

She gonna look at him like, "Shit, I didn't
know that nigga could catch that.

I'ma have to step
my game up. "

Rich black man and white woman
don't go together.

Ask O. J., Kobe, Tiger woods.
It ain't no good.

'Cause white women will
set your ass up.

See, everybody think a sister
is the strongest motherfucking
woman on earth.

To an extent, that is true, but at least
a sister will let you know up front.

"Nigga, I will fuck you up. "

You know what you dealing with.

White women... sneaky.

"Really?"

"Is like that, Tom?"

She get on the phone.
"Hello? Officer?"

"He raped me... "

White women play victim
quick than a motherfucker.

But that white man gotta learn
from you white women.

See, when that white man
get mad, he get mad.

You know, brothers, we get mad,
we march "We shall overcome..."

You know, we get a good March in,
Misspell signs, we gone.

That white man get mad, he snap.

You know, white women like,
"I'm taking the kids. I'm taking the house.

We're gone.
We're out of here, you asshole. "

That white man be like this.
"I came from a long line of brookshires.

You're not gonna take my seed
from me, Guinevere. "

Now, here's the one sentence
that white man got for they ass.
"Over my dead body. "

And that motherfucker
mean that shit.

"Over my dead body".

I'll kill you. Then I'll kill the kids.
I'll burn the fucking house to the ground,
then I'll do myself. "

Brother can't even try that shit. Sister
be like, "Nigga, I'm leaving you. "

"I'ma kill you". "You killing who?
Let the killing begin, motherfucker!

Nigga be like, "I'm just
playing, girl. I'm just playing.

You know I'm joking with you, girl.
You know I'm joking with you.

We don't even get to the part
of burning the house down and the kids.

They always try to make it like
everybody's after the white woman.

You look at the movies.
King kong after the bitch.

You all know damn well this is
a nigga story...

The big old gorilla...

He had all them fine African sisters
and one white woman and lose his mind.

That's why they call it "Jungle fever".

That motherfucker Kong got that white
bitch. Nigga, he picked her up.
Just blowing on the ho.

"I got my white bitch!
I got my white bitch!"

They took his white bitch.
That motherfucker swam to New York.

They took the bitch up on a building.
"Where's my white bitch?

I need my white bitch!"

They got some new
kind of white women now.

You know, I'm in my 40s.
You know, I remember when all
white women had straight backs.

You know what I mean?
No ass. Just a long back.

You know, you could lay 'em down,
get a good crease in your pants.

Now they got some ass on 'em.
I don't know what you white
women are eating, but keep it up.

'Cause they'd be walking down the street.
¶ ga-gonk ga-gonk ¶

"You got competition,
Laqueisha. "

'Cause, you know, every city I go to
on tour, there's always the brother

with the white woman.

Now, brothers, let me ask y'all something,
'cause I see a couple of y'all
here with your white women.

Why, when y'all get a white woman,
y'all get the ugliest white bitch in town?

And be walking proud with 'em.
"Yeah, this is mine. "

Holding hands and shit.
You know what I mean?

Brothers don't even hold hands
with they own sister.
You know what I mean?

You watch a brother walking down
a street. Sister be behind 'em.

"I'm with you. "
"Come on. Keep up. "

Nigga get a white woman,
act like he hit the jackpot.

"Yes, I got her. "

But when you see a white man
with a sister... Oh, they get
the baddest sister they got in town.

Oh, white boys don't fuck around.
When they get a sister, they get a sistah.

And they be walking, holding hands.
"Goddamn right I got her. "

"I'm gonna teach her
how to Riverdance. "

Nothing against you white people.
Y'all just different.

You know how them motherfuckers say
they don't like black people, right?

And the ones that I'm talking about,
I'm talking about you. Not all white people.

There's some cool motherfuckers.
You're here.

Obviously, motherfucker,
you're here.

But you know the ones I'm talking about,
them motherfucking racist sons of bitches.

"I don't like black people. "
Well, why you lay out in the sun
and try to become black?

You don't see black people laying out
in the moonlight trying to lighten up.

Like, "brother, what you doing?"
"Nigga, I'm trying to get that prince tone.

Morris day up in this bitch. "

Be happy to be white,
white folks.

Y'all ain't even white,
Really. Y'all colored.

Y'all should all join the NAACP.

Nationa Association For Advancement
of Colored People

You understand me?
'Cause y'all colored people.

Only white people can
turn red when they mad. Look at 'em.

They blush.
They're a little pink.

When you hit 'em,
they blue and purple.

SAN DIEGO. SAN FRANCISCO.
SAN JOSE.

Nigga!

You motherfuckers.

I don't.

If I'm in that second set, I would have
been like, "Hey, hey, hold the fuck up.

"Them was your black belts."

"My shit is orange!"

"You the teacher. Teach!"

"Now, if you whoop his ass,
I'll keep taking your class."

"If not, I'm about to study
with that motherfucker."

I'm Eddie Griffin. Y'all been wonderful.
Good night, Oakland, baby.
