--<i>before the end</i>
<i>of the season last year...</i>

<i>...and then re-injured it</i>
<i>in spring training...</i>

<i>...on a terrific game-saving play.</i>

<i>You know, I was talking with....</i>

-What time is this going on?
-7:30 is the pre-game.

-Who'd you say was pitching tonight?
-Tiant's pitching.

-Goddamn Cuban, man. He can hurl it.
-I'd hate to be facing him.

-Who are they playing tonight, Yankees?
-Yankees.

Imagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball coming
at you. You don't have time to think.

What kind of night
you think Fisk will have?

He's been hot lately.

He gets on base twice tonight,
gets on base twice, I'll paint your porch.

Save.

The sewer.

Hold on, I'll get it.

Sorry, guys, I guess I don't
know my own strength.

You know what, Dave? That must be it.

Hey...

...you guys know what
would be really cool?

-What?
-Driving a car.

You know, just around the block.

Yeah?

Anyone on this street
keep their keys in their car?

I steal a car, my dad will kill me.

Just around the block. Who said steal?

Your dad kill you
for writing your name too?

See, now it'll be there forever.

Me too.

Forever.

Let me ask you something.

You brats think it's okay to destroy
municipal property?

Huh?

Come here.

Get over here.

Well, do you?

-No, sir.
-No, sir.

-No.
-No, what?

Sir.

You're the hard case of the group, huh?

A pack of punks, huh?

You live around here?

Right there.

You?

Right over there.

How about you?
Where do you live, son?

-Rester Street.
-Is your mother home?

We're gonna go have a talk with her.
Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.

Get in.

Get the fuck inside.

In.

You kids go tell your mothers
what you've been up to.

And don't let me catch you shits
ruining my sidewalks again.

What do you mean?
Who put Dave in a car?

The cop. He had a gold badge.

How do you know it was a cop?
See anything on the badge?

-No, no writing.
-He had a uniform on?

Like a regular police uniform?

-He was a cop.
-He took Davey.

-So, what were you guys doing?
-We wrote our names in the cement, but--

You were writing in cement
and playing hockey, but they took Dave?

-That doesn't make sense. Come on.
-Is there something wrong, Dad?

Please.

No more.

Please.

No more, please.

-Have you seen him?
-Looks like damaged goods to me.

Jesus.

You took some good swings today.

Dad, I struck out.

Good swings, though. That's what counts.

I'll never be a good ballplayer.

You're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.

Star shortstop, Trinity High School,
1978 to '82.

You're gonna be a great ballplayer.

-Hey, see that gutter drain over there?
-Yeah.

I used to play on this street
when I was a kid.

That drain swallowed every ball we had.

Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.

If we could get that manhole cover up...

...could be 1000 balls down there.

Really? Let's try.

Get in.

Come on, Dad,
come help me hunt for balls.

Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home
before Mom starts to worry.

Jimmy. Jimmy.

Earth to Mr. Markum.

-What do you want now, Pete?
-Like I'm Mr. Needy all of a sudden?

We're out of the Marlboros
and the Winstons are looking grim.

-So?
-So that means less profit...

...and more profit means I get a raise.

So why don't you order more.

All right, but if the
surgeon general calls, you're my alibi.

-Hey, you.
-Hey, there.

I'm going out tonight
with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.

Don't stay out too late. You got your
sister's First Communion tomorrow.

-Christ, I sound like....
-Someone's father?

Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.

-Later, Daddy.
-Later.

Have fun.

-Later.
-Later.

Brendan.

-You scared the shit out of me.
-I'm sorry, I didn't want your dad to see me.

He sees you sneaking
into my car, he'll shoot you.

What will he do if he sees this?

Shoot you and then kill you.

It's been six hours.

I had to see you.

I'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.

Tomorrow?

Like we planned?

Tomorrow.

Drop me around the corner.

-Take it easy.
-He kept cutting me off!

He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!

He followed me all the way from goddamn
Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me!

That son of a bitch!

Can you believe this guy keeps confessing?

I don't know. Maybe we ought to grab
a lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.

Hey, Devine?

-What you looking at?
-The old neighborhood.

-We're done, Sean, but I can stick around.
-No, I think we're good, thanks.

A few of us are going
to the Cantab after.

No, I don't think so, Jen.
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

Yeah.

-So the wife left you six months ago?
-So?

So Jenny Coughlin there
with the body, voice and the cuffs....

This girl, she makes gay guys
rethink their orientation.

So, what's your point?

The girl just wants to bed you,
not wed you. You don't even blink?

She wants to worship
at the temple of Devine.

-I'm married, Whitey.
-So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.

-You haven't talked to Lauren in six months.
-She calls all the time.

And says absolutely nothing.
Weirdest thing I ever heard of.

One of these days, the phone's gonna ring
and she'll tell me why she left.

Yeah? Maybe she's waiting
for you to say something.

Come on, come on, come on.

<i>The pitch. A swing and a line drive</i>
<i>into right field. A base hit.</i>

I just don't feel like
they're gonna win this one.

Could we please have three beers?

Yeah, come on.

You believe those chicks?

-Come on.
-Oh, yeah, baby.

Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?

-We've got you right over here, boys.
-Yeah.

Yeah.

I've known her since she was a kid.

<i>A ball and two strikes. Two on, two out.</i>

Dave.

It's 3 in the morning.

Where have you been?

Oh, my God.

I fucked up.

What happened?

This guy tried to mug me,
and I swung on him and he sliced me.

But look at your hand.
We gotta go to the hospital.

No, no, it's not that bad.
It's not that deep.

-It bled like hell. I can't go to the hospital.
-Oh, my God, Dave.

Come on. Come here.

So I'm walking to my car, and this guy
comes up to me and asks for a light.

I say I don't smoke.
He says neither does he.

My heart starts clocking a buck fifty
because there's no one around.

-Oh, God.
-That's when I see the knife.

Says, ''Your wallet or your life.
I'm leaving with one of them.''

-That's what he said?
-Yeah.

So I try to brush past him.
That's when he slices me.

-You said you swung on him first.
-Jesus, Celeste, can I tell the fucking story?

I'm sorry, babe.

I went fucking nuts on him, baby. I....

I went off.

I bashed his head on the parking lot.

There was blood everywhere.

I might have killed him.

Killed him?

It makes you feel...

...alone, you know, hurting somebody.

Yeah, but you had to, right?

It makes you feel...

...alien.

Okay.

Babe, you hop in the shower.

And I'll take care of your clothes.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

Here.

<i>911, police services.</i>
<i>What's the nature of your emergency?</i>

<i>There's, like, this car with blood in it,</i>
<i>and the door's open.</i>

-<i>What's the location of the car?</i>
-<i>Sydney Street.</i>

<i>It's in the Flats by Pen Park.</i>
<i>Me and my friend just found it.</i>

-<i>Son, what's your name?</i>
-<i>He wants to know her name.</i>

<i>Your name, what's your name?</i>

<i>We're so fucking out of here.</i>
<i>Good luck, man.</i>

<i>Dispatch, this is Unit 33.</i>

<i>We're gonna need a crime-scene tech,</i>
<i>and you might want to notify Homicide.</i>

<i>Thirty-three, have you</i>
<i>found a body yet? Over.</i>

<i>No, but by the looks of this car,</i>
<i>we'll find one sooner or later.</i>

-Yeah?
-I'm in the weeds here at the store...

...and I need some help.

You and Katie can't handle 6,
how you gonna handle the church crowd?

-That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
-Hold on.

I'll be there in 10 minutes.

Just call Sal, make sure he can
get there at 8 instead of 10.

No-shows at work,
what if she no-shows at church?

She'll be there.

You know, she's gonna
screw up this day too.

Oh, what other day
has she screwed up lately?

You got two other daughters,
don't forget.

I'll be at the church before anybody else,
don't worry about that.

What the fuck's going on here?

-Pete, anybody show?
-No.

Katie didn't call?

No.

-<i>Hello?</i>
-Drew, Jimmy.

Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for Katie.

Yeah, she's here, I think.
Hang on a second, let me go check.

Have a nice day.

<i>No, it was Diane Cestra</i>
<i>who slept over. No Katie.</i>

<i>Eve said she dropped her off at around</i>
<i>1:00. Didn't say where she was going.</i>

Don't worry, I'll track her down.

-<i>She seeing anybody maybe?</i>
-19-year-old girls, who can keep a tally?

-<i>That's the cold truth, bud.</i>
-I'll talk to you later.

I'll take hookers
over old ladies any day.

-Mind if I go grab a smoke?
-You can smoke the whole pack.

Can I help you, Brendan?

No, Mr. Markum, I'm looking
for some of that tea that my ma likes.

-That's Barry's. Next aisle.
-Thanks.

-When's Sal getting here?
-Anytime now.

-That it, Bren?
-A <i>Globe</i>.

I thought Katie worked on Sundays.

Are you sweet
on my man's daughter, Bren?

No, I just see her here sometimes.

Her little sister's making
her First Communion today.

Thanks. Come on, Ray.

Can I ask you something, Jimmy?

Shoot.

Why do you hate that kid so bad?

It's not hate. Doesn't that little
mute fucker spook you out sometimes?

No, not Silent Ray, Brendan.

He's nice. Does sign language with
his brother even though he doesn't have to.

He doesn't want him to feel alone.

But you look at Brendan
like you're two steps away...

...from slicing off his nose
and feeding it to him.

-No. Really?
-Straight up.

Here's Sal. About fucking time.

-Hey, there, bad boy.
-Sarge.

This should be the city's,
but the park's state jurisdiction.

So if the body's in there,
the case is ours.

How much evidence do you
think they've destroyed?

Let's go find out.

Parker Hill vic walks into the ER on his own,
steak knife sticking out of his collarbone.

He asks the nurse,
''Hey, where they keep the Coke machine?''

-Did she tell him?
-Tom, what do we got on the car so far?

We found the registration in the glove box.
Owner is Katherine Markum.

-Oh, shit.
-You know her?

Maybe. Might be the daughter
of a guy I know.

We found a wallet and a license
in a backpack. She's 19.

-Oh, fuck, that's her.
-Is it a problem? You close with the guy?

When we were kids. Now it's just
a ''hello'' around the neighborhood.

Nineteen.

Fuck, man.

He's in for a world of hurt.

Do not make her laugh.

Door was ajar when we found it,
headlights on.

Blood on the driver's door, speaker,
more blood on top of the steering wheel...

...around this bullet hole. Punched through
the driver's seatback, shoulder level.

Okay, perp stood outside the car...

...girl slams him with the door,
perp gets a round off...

...hits her in the shoulder, maybe the bicep.

She runs for it
through the trampled weeds....

-What do you think?
-Yeah, I dig that.

Body of Christ.

-Body of Christ.
-Amen.

My God, Jimmy, our baby.

Body of Christ.

Body of Christ.

Body of Christ.

So I'm thinking she hid
out here for a little bit.

The killer shows, she bolts.

She goes to the other side,
she takes off running again.

Well, we better call in some divers
while we're at it.

Body of Christ.

Body of Christ.

So you haven't seen him
in a long time or what?

No, I haven't seen him since we were kids.
Once in a while, I run into him.

Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?

-Daddy, Daddy!
-Hey, darling. Good day, huh?

This dress itches.

Yeah, I'm not even wearing it,
and it's itching me.

We are so proud of you.

Morning, honey.

Dave, there's nothing about it
in the papers. I checked three times.

It was late, real late.

-Morning, Mikey.
-Morning, Dad.

-You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
-Yeah, come on, let's go.

Come on.

Put your coat on, Mike.

Thanks, Mom.

-Hey, Jimmy.
-What's up, Ed?

They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.

Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going
into the Pen. Why you all decked out?

-Nadine's First Communion.
-What are you doing here?

Just curious, I guess.

That's my daughter's car.

That's my daughter's car.

The dog's sniffing
something by the old bear cage.

-Want to take a walk over?
-Yeah.

-<i>Trooper Devine?</i>
-Yeah, go ahead.

<i>We got a guy on Sydney</i>
<i>says he's the father.</i>

Oh, shit.

-Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
-<i>En route.</i>

Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

<i>Asking for you. Says he knows you.</i>
<i>Not taking no for an answer.</i>

<i>And he's got some guys with him.</i>

-What guys?
-<i>Crazy-looking guys.</i>

-The Savage brothers.
-Just a ''hi'' around the neighborhood, huh?

All right, I'm on my way.

-Hey, guys.
-That's our niece in there.

-Let us in.
-We're doing our job.

-Let us in.
-Fuck you!

The doughnut shop's that way!

-Nick, Val, ease up.
-Fucking dickhead.

-Enough.
-Nick.

Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

-Kevin, let's go.
-And, guys?

These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

-But get answers.
-You got it.

Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.

Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

-Is she in there?
-All we're doing is looking.

-Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
-That's my daughter's car.

-I understand.
-And it's got blood in it.

You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

-<i>Trooper Devine?</i>
-Yeah, say again.

<i>Sergeant Powers says you need</i>
<i>to get in here ASAP.</i>

-Your location?
-<i>The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.</i>

All right.

Make sure he doesn't get through.

You got those bolt cutters in your car?

I'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

Go.

<i>There's a massive search underway</i>
<i>for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.</i>

<i>All we know now</i>
<i>is there are signs of foul play...</i>

<i>...in a car found abandoned</i>
<i>outside of Pen Park.</i>

<i>Now, police officers have moved in quickly</i>
<i>and cordoned off the area...</i>

<i>...but even as we speak,</i>
<i>a crowd of spectators has gathered.</i>

<i>We don't know more than that,</i>
<i>but we will stay on the story.</i>

<i>Until later, this is Jim Smith</i>
<i>reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.</i>

Ready? Bat back.

All the way back.

I never saw anything like that before.

What do we got?

Oh, Christ.

Is that her?

Yeah.

We'll have the father
do a positive ID at the morgue.

Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

She was shot a second time.
Looks like a .38.

What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

''Hey, Jimmy...

...God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect.''

-Hey.
-Hold on!

-Grab him. Stop that guy.
-Hey, you!

-I'm fucking going in there!
-Take it easy!

-Get his arms.
-Hold him. Come on.

-Let me in, you motherfuckers!
-Take it easy.

-Let me in!
-Is she in there?!

-Sean, is my daughter in there?!
-Let me in! You motherfuckers!

Is my daughter in there?! Is she in there?!
Is she in there?!

Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

Is my daughter in there?! Motherfuckers!

Is that my daughter in there?!

Look into my eyes! Is she in there?!

-Get off me!
-Sean, is that my daughter in there?!

Is that my daughter in there?

No! No!

Oh, no!

No, God!

Oh, God, no!

No one's said anything, right?

What do you mean?

You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?

Jimmy?

-Jimmy, please....
-Please what?

-Please--
-Please what, baby? Please what?

That's her.

That's Katie.

That's my daughter.

Fresh-brewed.

So we need to work a time line.

It's details, little things
that make a case.

You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

I heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

At the last minute, she changed her mind.

See what I mean?

What do you mean, Jimmy?

What if you or I had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

-What car?
-You're losing me here.

If I'd gotten into that car that day,
my life would have been a different thing.

My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...

...she was a beautiful woman.

Regal.

As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

You had to have balls
to go near her, and I did.

Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

Now, here's the thing, Sean.

If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.

I never would have had the juice
to go near her.

And Katie never would have been born.

And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

-You ever see Dave around?
-He married my cousin Celeste.

What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

Around 7:30.

Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

She was having dinner with her friends.

-Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
-Yeah.

She talked to Nadine
about her Communion...

...and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

And then around 8, she left.

-Do you know who she talked to?
-No.

Do you mind if we have the phone company
subpoenaed for records?

-No, go ahead.
-Good.

You say you spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

Yes and no. I was mostly in back.

Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

No, she was herself, she was happy. She--

She what?

It's nothing.

Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

It's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died...

...I had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter...

...but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

-Okay.
-It was just a look.

It's information. We collect it,
put it together, see what fits. Little things.

You were in prison?

-Oh, Jesus.
-Here we go.

-Whitey.
-I'm just asking.

Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer Island.

Is that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.

-Sorry.
-It's all right. It's all right.

Okay, Mr. Markum.

-Okay.
-Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...

...outside of the look Katie gave you,
was there anything else?

There was this kid.

What am I talking about?
That was this morning.

What? Remember, it's the little things.

This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

-Barely knew each other.
-Could they have been dating?

-No.
-What makes you so sure?

Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

No one right now, as far as we know.

-I mean, knew.
-I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.

We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

And if you think of anything...

...anything at all, give us a call.

He said you almost got into a car
when you were kids?

Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle
were playing in front of my house.

This car came up and took Dave away.

-Abduction?
-Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.

Convinced Dave to get in the car,
kept him for four days before he escaped.

-They catch these guys?
-One died.

The other got busted,
went the noose route in his cell.

Your pal Markum, the moment I laid
eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.

They never lose that tension,
it settles in their shoulders.

He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.

No, that's in his stomach.
The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.

Cause of death: the gunshot wound to
the head, not the trauma from the beating.

-What else?
-Her and her friends were barhopping.

We're interviewing anyone
who might have seen them.

One other thing,
the backpack in her car...

...had pamphlets on Las Vegas
and a list of Vegas hotels.

It doesn't sound like much.

What do you say, Devine?

We'll get the guy, sir.

That's right. All right, let's do it.

-That's the best you can come up with?
-It made him happy, didn't it?

This is Sean.

-Hello?
-Is it Lauren?

You're in Manhattan.
I can tell by the traffic sounds.

Is he with you?

Is that the baby?

Lauren, at least tell me her name.

Yeah, nice talking to you too.

Hey.

Would it surprise you?

Wouldn't be the first time.

Did you see that girl?
Did you see that--?

Did you see her?

-I heard a car hit something.
-Hit what? Another car?

-Oh, no, not loud like that.
-Like hitting the curb?

Yes, maybe.

Then it stalled, and someone said, ''Hi.''

-Someone said, ''Hi''?
-''Hi.''

Then there was a loud crack.

-Could it have been a gunshot?
-Yes, maybe.

-Did you look out your window, Mrs. Prior?
-Oh, no.

I was in my dressing gown by then.

I don't look out the window
in my dressing gown.

The voice you heard,
was that a male or a female?

Female.

I think.

-It sounds like the girl knew the shooter.
-Yeah.

Sorry to trouble you.

-Jimmy.
-Theo.

How's my daughter?
How's Annabeth holding up?

-She's trying.
-Let's get these on ice.

You got a couple of coolers?

Right here's fine.

So how are you handling all this so far?

-It hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
-Yeah?

It's gonna hurt like hell when it does.

When my Janey died,
I was no good for six months...

...but my kids were
all grown up. I had that luxury.

You, you got domestic responsibilities.

Domestic responsibilities?

Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls. That's your first priority.

Oh, you figured that might
have slipped my mind?

It just needed to be said, that's all.

You'll come through
because you're a man.

Like I said to Annabeth,
your wedding day.

I said, ''You got yourself
a real old-school man there.''

-Like they put her in a bag.
-What?

That's what Katie looked like
when I saw her in the morgue.

Like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes.

-Well--
-Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.

She went to sleep,
she never woke up. Peaceful.

-You don't need to talk about Janey.
-My daughter was murdered.

They put a gun to her. As we stand here,
she's on an autopsy slab...

...getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders...

...and you're talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility?

Good to see you, Theo.

Eve, just tell them what they want to know.

-Who was she dating?
-We already told the Savages.

-The Savage brothers?
-They were here yesterday.

Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?

No one special.

You guys were having
a goodbye dinner, right?

-What?
-She was leaving town, wasn't she?

-Going to Las Vegas?
-How do you know?

She closed her bank account,
she had hotel phone numbers.

She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.

Well, a 19-year-old girl
doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.

So who was she going with?

Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?

Brendan.

Excuse me?

-Brendan.
-Brendan Harris?

Brendan Harris, yeah.

You got an address?

Hey, Dave.

Hey, Jimmy.

Sorry, I came out for a smoke.

Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.

I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all day.

How you doing?

How you doing?

What happened to your hand?

This?

I was helping a buddy move a couch.
I slammed it in the doorjamb.

Ways you can manage
to hurt yourself, right?

It's good to see you.

Yeah?

How are our girls holding up?

They're doing okay, I guess.

That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

Yeah.

I couldn't stand looking through the fridge
to find room for all that food...

...we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

-Lot of waste, huh?
-Yeah.

I just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little...

...that girl was neat.

When I got out of the joint...

...you know, after Marita died...

...I remember, I was more afraid
of my little daughter...

...than I ever was of being in prison.

I loved her...

...most...

...because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night...

...it was like we were the last two people
on Earth. You know, forgotten.

Unwanted.

And it's really starting to piss me off, Dave,
because I can't cry for her.

My own little daughter,
and I can't even cry for her.

Jimmy.

You're crying now.

Yeah, damn.

I just want to hug her one more time.

She was 19 fucking years old.

Do you want me to leave you alone?

No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

-You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
-She isn't hurt. She's dead.

-I didn't kill her.
-Again, when's the last time you saw her?

About 8--
Saturday night, about 8:00.

About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

It was about 8.

We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

I don't know.

But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

-He's not a thief.
-He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

Daughter probably had the same bad gene.
You count yourself lucky, Bren.

So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

We were gonna leave Sunday.

We were gonna get married
when we got there.

Well, that was the plan, right?

You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

-Ma, I was gonna tell you.
-Just like your father, huh?

That's my brother, Ray,
and his friend John.

-Hey, boys.
-Hey.

He don't speak.

Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

So where were you between 12:30
and 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, Brendan?

I was asleep.

Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

He came down for breakfast at 9.

I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

Okay, we're gonna ask you to take
a polygraph. You think you'd be up for that?

I loved her so much.

I'm never gonna feel that again.

It doesn't happen twice.

Doesn't happen once most times.

Celeste.

-Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
-What are you still doing here?

I don't know.

I don't know, I just....

Did Annabeth get to sleep?

Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.

-Could I get one of those?
-Yeah.

One for the road and then home.

Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

You've done enough.

To you and Dave for being here for this.

Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.

I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

Good night.

-Good night.
-Yeah, good night.

Hello?

Christ. Lauren, say something.

''Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?''

<i>Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing things</i>
<i>made sense.</i>

<i>I'm tired of caring about some dead girl, and</i>
<i>there's just gonna be another one after her.</i>

Sending killers to jail is sending them where
they've been heading all their lives.

The dead are still dead.

Jesus, I...

...can't do this tonight.

I just....

I can't do it.

Bye, baby.

Because...

...sometimes the man wasn't a man at all.

He was the boy.

The boy who escaped from wolves.

An animal of the dusk.

Invisible.

Silent.

Living in a world...

...the others never saw.

World of fireflies.

Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

I just gotta get my head right.

Catch a nice, long sleep.

And the boy will go back to his forest.

Back to his fireflies.

Is he asleep?

How's Jimmy and everybody?

Okay.

It's weird.

Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

Dave? Dave.

There's still nothing in the paper.

About what?

About what?

I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
hurt him as bad as I thought.

He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

Yeah.

Right.

Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

I mean, Katie Markum is dead.

That seems more important right now.

I know in my soul I contributed
to your death.

But I don't know how.

Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

Good. I didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

All people who, I'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

Considering the crime, maybe.

Dave Boyle?

Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

Could be.

He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

-Clam up for no reason, huh?
-We'll see.

Hey, Boyle!

-What's it been, seven, eight years?
-Yeah.

Yeah. How you doing?

This is my son, Michael.

Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.

I'm an old buddy of your dad's. Hi.

-So you still with the staties?
-Homicide. This is my partner.

-Sergeant Powers. How are you?
-So you got a minute?

-We'd love to ask some quick questions.
-I was just gonna walk Michael to school.

-I can be back in a few minutes.
-Tell you what, we'll walk with you, okay?

Sure.

So you look good.

-I hear rents are rising.
-Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

They're cutting my dad's old house up
into condos.

We walked by there the other day.

Must be something we could do
to stop them.

A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

''Neighborhood needs a fucking crime wave.
Get property values where they belong.''

Young girls keep getting murdered up in Pen
Park, Mr. Boyle, you might get your wish.

Dave. Call me Dave.

You said the F-word, Dad.

Yeah, I know. Walk on up ahead, Michael.

Us guys need to talk. Go on.

-So, what's up, Sean?
-Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

-Who's Celeste?
-My wife.

-How's Jimmy doing?
-It's hard to tell. You know him.

-Yeah, so the reason we came by--
-Listen, I saw her.

Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

That's what we wanted to talk about.

They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

-Pretty drunk, huh?
-But it was harmless.

They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

What time did they leave?

I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

-So we'll say 12:45?
-Sounds about right.

You see anything unusual
or anyone--?

Michael.

-Like what?
-I don't know.

A guy watching the girls?

A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

No. No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

-See you later, Dad.
-You got your milk money?

Fuck, I hated school.

What?

Yeah, me too, Sean.

Just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

-Home.
-Home by 1:15, would you say?

-Roughly. Sure.
-All right.

Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

-Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
-All right.

What?

What happened to him in that car?

Can you believe this?

Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

...you're not left with a whole lot.

Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

Hears a gunshot,
before that a ''hi'' ...

...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

She turns into the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

-She says, ''Hi.'' He shoots her.
-She slams the door into him, takes off.

What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

-I don't know. Something in the street.
-Maybe.

This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

-She hit hard enough to get a jump on him?
-Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

Wait a second, how did we get to
Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

-We just got to him.
-He's a guy who was in the bar.

The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

Just a little one.

I'd recommend two sets of visiting hours,
from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

-Sure.
-Good.

-Have you thought about flowers?
-I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

Good.

And the notice?

Notice?

Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

Where's my daughter?

Downstairs, in the basement.

I wanna see her.

I'm gonna find him, Katie.

I'm gonna find him before the police do.

I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

The notice.

It should read: ''Katherine Markum...

...beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased...

...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to--''

''Sister to Sara and Nadine.''
