{\an1\pos(62,432)}I'M NOT GOING

{\an1\pos(62,432)}BUT WHAT YOU DID
WAS TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}JUST WHAT DID YOU THINK
YOU WERE GONNA DO OUT THERE?

{\an1\pos(206,432)}I DON'T KNOW.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}MR. RESNICK MENTIONED
THAT OLD TRIBE,

{\an1\pos(206,432)}AND I READ
ALL ABOUT THEM,

{\an1\pos(206,432)}HOW THEY WERE LIKE
REALLY WEIRD DUDES.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}THEY TRIED TO MAKE,
LIKE,

{\an1\pos(206,432)}AN EVIL KID
OR SOMETHING,

{\an1\pos(206,432)}YOU KNOW, A DEVIL CHILD,
THEY CALLED IT.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}SANZIAS WERE INTO
REALLY SCARY STUFF.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}IT JUST GOT ME GOING,
I GUESS.

{\an1\pos(134,432)}WHAT DID YOU SAY
THE NAME OF THAT TRIBE WAS?

{\an1\pos(206,432)}SANZIA.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}FROM NOW ON,
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT

{\an1\pos(62,432)}SOME OF THE MORE EXOTIC
GOINGS-ON AROUND HERE,

{\an1\pos(62,432)}SUCH AS MR. RESNICK
AND THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGS.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}WHAT?

{\an1\pos(134,432)}\h\h\h\hDAD, COME ON.
THE DIGS ARE A COOL PLACE.

{\an1\pos(134,432)}WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

{\an1\pos(62,432)}IT HAS TO DO
WITH YOUR ABILITY

{\an1\pos(62,432)}TO SEPARATE WHAT'S REAL
AND WHAT'S NOT.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

{\an1\pos(278,432)}I THOUGHT THAT YOU'D
BE MORE COMFORTABLE

{\an1\pos(278,432)}IF DOLLY SLEPT OVER
THERE IN THE CHAIR.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}DON'T TOUCH HER.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}JESSICA,
I'M TAKING THE DOLL

{\an1\pos(278,432)}OUT OF THE BED

{\an1\pos(206,432)}AND I DON'T WANT HEAR
ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}AAH! I'LL KILL YOU!

{\an1\pos(62,432)}DON'T TAKE HER, DADDY!

{\an1\pos(422,432)}CALM DOWN.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}I WANT MY DOLLY.

{\an1\pos(350,432)}IT'S OK

{\an1\pos(62,432)}WE KEEP EACH OTHER

{\an1\pos(206,432)}COME ON. GET UNDER
THE COVERS NOW.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}JIMMY, GO TO YOUR ROOM.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}SHE SAID
SHE'D KILL ME.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}IF YOU'D HEARD
HER VOICE, ELLIOT...

{\an1\pos(206,432)}ELLIOT, SHE'S CHANGING.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}SHE'S--SHE'S CHANGING.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}IT'S...

{\an1\pos(206,432)}IT'S THE DOLL.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}IT'S CONTROLLING HER
SOMEHOW.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}IT'S DOING SOMETHING
TO HER.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}DON'T YOU SEE IT?

{\an1\pos(206,432)}NO, I DON'T SEE IT.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}I SEE
THAT YOU'VE CHANGED.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}I'M GETTING HER
OUT OF HERE.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}I'M AFRAID FOR HER.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}I WANT TO TAKE HER
BACK TO L.A.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}MARILYN, WE'VE
INVESTED EVERYTHING

{\an1\pos(206,432)}INTO THIS FACTORY.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}WE CAN'T JUST PACK UP

{\an1\pos(206,432)}BECAUSE OUR 7-YEAR-OLD

{\an1\pos(350,432)}HONEY...

{\an1\pos(278,432)}WE'LL WORK
WITH HER, OK?

{\an1\pos(278,432)}SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}JUST LET HER GO THROUGH
SOME CHANGES.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}YOU'RE NOT HEARING
A WORD I'M SAYING.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}THAT MAN--THAT MAN
KARL RESNICK--

{\an1\pos(278,432)}WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE CRYPT

{\an1\pos(278,432)}IN THE FIELD?

{\an1\pos(278,432)}WHY IS HE SO
INTERESTED IN IT?

{\an1\pos(62,432)}HE'S INTERESTED BECAUSE
HE'S AN ARCHAEOLOGIST.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

{\an1\pos(206,432)}I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}I'M TRYING
TO MAKE SENSE OF IT.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}CAMILLA WAS FRIGHTENED
OF THE SANZIA.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}SHE SAID THAT JESSICA

{\an1\pos(206,432)}SPOKE TO HER
IN THEIR LANGUAGE.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF CAMILLA

{\an1\pos(62,432)}MUMBLING
OVER BURNING CANDLES.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}IF JESSICA SAID ANYTHING,
SHE HEARD IT FROM HER.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}NO, SHE DIDN'T,
ELLIOT.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}SHE HEARD IT
FROM SOMEONE,

{\an1\pos(278,432)}BUT IT WASN'T HER.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}OK I'M SORRY.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}I'M TIRED, I'M HUNGRY,

{\an1\pos(62,432)}IT'S THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT,

{\an1\pos(62,432)}AND I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS RIGHT NOW.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}[DOOR CREAKS]

{\an1\pos(62,432)}MR. RESNICK,
I'M MARILYN WADE.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}OH, HAPPY TO MEET YOU,
SEÃ‘ORA WADE.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}I SEE YOUR BEAUTY
IN YOUR SON'S FACE.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}HOW IS HE?
HE HAD A ROUGH NIGHT.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}IT WAS AN
UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}YES, IT WAS.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}I WONDER IF I
COULD TALK TO YOU

{\an1\pos(62,432)}ABOUT THESE CARVINGS
DOWN HERE.

{\an1\pos(422,432)}OH, PLEASE.

{\an1\pos(134,432)}THESE.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}THESE WERE REMOVED
FROM THE TOMB?

{\an1\pos(350,432)}YES.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}WELL, ACTUALLY,

{\an1\pos(278,432)}THEY'RE PORTIONS
OF THE DAMAGED DOOR.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}SEE, THE DETAILS
ARE EXQUISITE.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}THESE ARE VERY OLD.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}SANZIA, RIGHT?

{\an1\pos(422,432)}CORRECT.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}OUR SON TELLS US

{\an1\pos(62,432)}THESE PEOPLE HAVE
A GRISLY HISTORY.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

{\an1\pos(206,432)}WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE REMAINS

{\an1\pos(206,432)}OF THE SANZIA
DEVIL CHILD.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}THE LEGENDS SAY

{\an1\pos(206,432)}THE SANZIA
PREPARED A PLACE

{\an1\pos(206,432)}FOR THE BIRTH
OF SATAN'S CHILD.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}THEY SUCKLED A CHILD

{\an1\pos(206,432)}THAT WAS NEITHER
MAN NOR BEAST.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}IT HAD THE BODY
OF AN INFANT

{\an1\pos(224,432)}AND THE HEAD
OF A GOAT.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}THEY FED IT
WITH THE WARM BLOOD

{\an1\pos(206,432)}OF SLAUGHTERED CHILDREN.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}A CHILD SO EVIL THAT
ITS REIGN OF TERROR

{\an1\pos(206,432)}ALMOST CAUSED
THEIR EXTINCTION

{\an1\pos(206,432)}BEFORE THEY
PUT THE CREATURE

{\an1\pos(206,432)}TO ITS HOWLING DEATH.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}AND YOU KNEW THIS BEFORE
YOU OPENED THE CRYPT?

{\an1\pos(206,432)}SEÃ‘ORA, WHATEVER MADE
THE SANZIA AFRAID,

{\an1\pos(206,432)}THIS CHILD WAS NOT
SUPERNATURAL.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WASN'T?

{\an1\pos(278,432)}BECAUSE
I'M A MAN OF REASON.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}MR. RESNICK,

{\an1\pos(62,432)}MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN
DRAWING THESE SYMBOLS

{\an1\pos(62,432)}SINCE WE ARRIVED HERE.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}OUR HOUSEKEEPER CAMILLA

{\an1\pos(62,432)}TOLD ME THAT JESSICA

{\an1\pos(62,432)}SHE TRIED TO WARN ME,
AND NOW SHE'S DEAD...

{\an1\pos(62,432)}AND SO IS
THE NIGHT WATCHMAN,

{\an1\pos(80,432)}AND SO IS
YOUR ARCHAEOLOGIST,

{\an1\pos(62,432)}AND MY DAUGHTER IS BEING
TOUCHED BY SOMETHING,

{\an1\pos(62,432)}BY SOME OUTSIDE FORCE.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}SEÃ‘ORA,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

{\an1\pos(62,432)}CAMILLA SAID SHE HAS A SISTER
IN THE CONVENT.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}I WANT TO SPEAK WITH HER.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}UH...MOM SAID
YOU SHOULD TAKE A NAP.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}UM...BUT THAT'S OK

{\an1\pos(206,432)}YOU DON'T HAVE TO
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?

{\an1\pos(422,432)}YES, I DO.

FOR SISTER ALVA.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}SISTER ALVA IS ILL.

HAS PASSED AWAY.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}I KNOW. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT I SEE HER.

IS IN DANGER.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}I'M VERY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

ABOUT MY DAUGHTER?

{\an1\pos(206,432)}YOU OF THE MODERN WORLD.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}YOU PUT YOUR FAITH
IN YOUR MACHINES,

{\an1\pos(206,432)}YOUR SCIENCE.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}YOU IGNORE THE POWERS
OF HEAVEN AND HELL.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}MY SISTER
TRIED TO WARN YOU.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}YES, I KNOW SHE DID.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}BUT, PLEASE,
TELL ME NOW.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO MY DAUGHTER?

{\an1\pos(62,432)}HOW CAN I STOP IT?

{\an1\pos(278,432)}IT'S TOO LATE.

{\an1\pos(278,432)}THE SPIRIT OF THE
SANZIA DEVIL CHILD

{\an1\pos(278,432)}HAS BEEN SET FREE.
IT'S TOO LATE.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}LISTEN TO ME, I'M NOT

{\an1\pos(62,432)}COULD IT--COULD IT
GO INTO SOMETHING...

{\an1\pos(62,432)}OTHER THAN A HUMAN?

{\an1\pos(62,432)}COULD IT
GO INTO A DOLL?

{\an1\pos(206,432)}THE DEVIL TAKES
ANY FORM IT DESIRES.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}IT CAN BE ONE,

{\an1\pos(206,432)}OR IT CAN BE MANY.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}THE SANZIA DEVIL CHILD
WANTS CHILDREN.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}IT WILL DO ANYTHING

{\an1\pos(206,432)}TO SPREAD ITS WORD
TO THE CHILDREN.

{\an1\pos(62,432)}THROUGH THE DOLLS?

{\an1\pos(206,432)}I DON'T KNOW WHAT COURSE

{\an1\pos(206,432)}IT'S FEAR THAT KEEPS
THEM IGNORANT.

{\an1\pos(206,432)}TO BELIEVE THAT
