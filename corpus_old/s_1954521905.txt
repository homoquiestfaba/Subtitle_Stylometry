<I> When I Was 16,</I>

<I> I Married The First Man</I>
<I> Who Lit Up My Bed,</I>

<I>And Then I Popped Out Four Kids</I>
<I> Faster Than I Could Manage.</I>

<I> So No,</I>
<I> I'Ve Never Been To France.</I>

<I> But That Doesn'T Mean</I>
<I> I Can'T Have My Artifacts...</I>

<I> Or My Dreams.</I>

[ Sighs ]

Want To Keep Those Toes,
You Better Lift Those Feet.

Turn It Off.

We Need To Talk.

We Can Talk
All You Want

As Long As You Pick
Your Feet Up.

[ Inhaler Hisses ]

You Okay?

Yeah, I'M Okay.
Cord Is Not So Good.

You Want To Talk?
What? What Is It?

I Want Us
To Do Something Together,

Something Big --

Sell The House,
Move To Florida,

Buy A Boat We Can Charter
In The Everglades.

Are You Out Of Your Mind?!

Sell The House
And Buy A Boat?!

How About You Buy Me
A Vacuum Cleaner?!

I'M Not Out Of My Mind.

I'M Awake
For The First Time In Years.

Vy,
We'Ve Been Asleep Too Long.

[ Scoffs ]

There'S Nothing
Going On For Us Here,

Not Inside This House
Or Outside Of It.

Oh, I Think
You Better Speak For Yourself,

'Cause I Have A Lot
Going On.

I Have The House,
I Have The Church,

And I Have The Kids.

The Kids Are 15 Years Past
Needing Us.

15 Years Past
Needing<I> You.</I>

All You Were To Them
Was A Wallet.

I Raised Them.

I Mind Their Business
Better Than I Mind My Own.

You Used To.

Nowadays, It Seems Like

You'Re Sleeping
Through That, Too.

Why Don'T We At Least Take
A Vacation?

We Can Throw A Few Things
In The Car,

Drive Up The Shore,

Find A Motel
With A Hot Tub In It.

I'Ll Even Do
My Big-Daddy Dance For You.

Where'S Big Daddy Been
The Last 30 Years?

All Those Times I Wanted

To Go And Do
Something Adventurous --

Where'S He Been?

I'Ve Been Working,
Building Up My Business,

Taking Care
Of My Family.

Well, Now<I> I'M</I> Working,
Cleaning My Kitchen,

Taking Care Of My House.

Come On, Vy.
Vy.

Please,
Don'T Do This, Vy.

It'S Not Too Late
For Us.

We Can Still Find Us
If We Look For Us.

[ Groans ]

Cecil,
What Do You Want?

Was I Not A Good Wife?
Was I Not A Good Mother?

Didn'T You Get
Everything You Wanted?

Yes,
I Got Everything I Wanted.

Well, I Didn'T Get
Everything I Wanted.

Okay.
What Is It You Want?

Right Now
I Want To Be Left Alone

So I Can Clean
The Counter.

So You Have No Interest

In Trying To Fix
What'S Broken Between Us?

The Only Thing I Want You To Fix
Is The Pipe In The Basement.

I'Ll Get My Things
In The Morning.

When You'Re Done
Feeling Sorry For Yourself,

Pick Up Some Chinese,
Will You?

I Love You, Vy.

I Really Do.

I Just Don'T Like Your Ass
No More.

[ Door Closes ]

[ Telephone Ringing ]

[ Groans ]

[ Answering Machine Beeps ]

Janelle:<I> Hi, Mama. It'S Me.</I>
<I> Pick Up.</I>

I Know You Can Hear Me.

You'Re The Last Person
On The Planet With A Machine.

<I> You'Ve Been All Cooped Up</I>
<I> Since You And Daddy --</I>

<I> I Can'T Even Say It.</I>

<I> I'Ll Come Get You,</I>
<I> We'Ll Go Shopping, Okay?</I>

You Wear Too Much Gray.

[ Sighs ]

<I> Damn Asthma.</I>
[ Breathing Heavily ]

<I> They Say Smoking</I>
<I> Or The Environment</I>

<I> Brings On Asthma.</I>

<I> You Want To Know</I>
<I> What Brings It On?</I>

<I> Rotten Kids</I>
<I> And Ungrateful Husbands.</I>

[ Wheezing ]

[ Wheezing Continues ]

[ Air Hissing ]

[ Gasping ]
[ Ringing ]

Woman: 911. What'S The Nature
Of Your Emergency?

[ Gasping ]
Hello.
Can You Hear Me?

Biscuits At The Truck.

Cecil,
It'S Vy'S Doc.

Dr. Cielto.

Vy'S Here.

I, Uh,
Put Her In Intensive Care.

How Bad?
I'Ve Got Her
On Her Favorite Ventilator,

And You Know
How She Gets.

Call The Kids
If You Can Find Them All

And Get Them Over Here

And Save My Nurses.

Thank You.

Viola:<I> I Love My Children,</I>
<I> But They Annoy Me.</I>

<I> ...Of Fleur De Sel.</I>

Al!

Wake Up The Girls
On Your Way Out Here!

<I> Charlotte Was A Bossy,</I>
<I> Little Thing</I>

<I> Right Out Of The Womb.</I>

<I>We Then Sprinkle Them</I>
<I> With A Little Bit</I>

<I> Of Fresh,</I>
<I> Ground Coriander.</I>

Now, If She Really
Wanted To Do Something,

She'D Put A Little Mango
Up In There.

<I> Now, If You Don'T Have</I>
<I>Coriander In Your Spice Rack --</I>

And Get A Better Bra
For Those Fake Boobs.

Show-Off.

Watching Your Sister'S Show
Again?

<I> Perfect.</I>

Get Off Of Me.

You Got A Whole Lot More
Going On Than Her.

[ Chuckles ]

Charlotte, My Wife.

Mm!
Hmm?

Full-Time Mother.
Ooh.

Expert Courier.

[ Laughs ]

Owner Of The Finest Laundromat
In Cook County.

Mm!

Your Wife,
Whose Handsome Husband

Is Going To Meet Her
At Wendell'S Furniture Later.

I Saw
The Most Beautiful Armoire.

It'S Gonna Look Gorgeous
In Tiffany'S Room.

Now,
Who Else Do I Know

That Fills
Every Corner Of Her House

With Stuff
That She Don'T Need, Huh?

Like Mother,
Like Daughter.

I Am Nothing Like
My Mother.

[ Telephone Rings ]

It'S Your Pops.

[ Telephone Beeps ]
Where Would He Get The Idea
I Want To Talk To Him?

Yes, Sir.

Your Beautiful,
Strong Daughter Is Right Here.

Take It.

Yeah, Pop.

<I> "Paris."</I>

<I> You Do Something To A Child</I>

<I> When You Name Her For A Place</I>
<I> You'Re Never Gonna See.</I>

<I> Spends Her Whole Life</I>

<I> Proving She'S Worth</I>
<I> What You Sacrificed.</I>

Is Everything,
Like, Okay, Ms. Price?

You Seemed A Little Distracted
Today.

My 16-Year-Old Son
Didn'T Come Home Last Night.

Oh.
I'M Sure He'S Fine.

That'S About The Age
For That Sort Of Thing.

Take Care Now.

It'S About The Age

Boys Like Him Get Measured
For Orange Jumpsuits.

<I> My Grandson</I>
<I> Is No Closer To Jail</I>

<I> Than His Father Is</I>
<I> To Being Respectable,</I>

<I> And Paris Needs To Learn</I>
<I> The Difference Between Them.</I>

<I> What She Doesn'T Need</I>

<I> Is Any More Of Those Little,</I>
<I> White Pills.</I>

<I> What She Does Need</I>
<I> Is A Good Orgasm.</I>

Hey, Mama.
It Smells Good.

What'S Cooking
This Week?

You Just Threw A Cabbage
At My Head.

Because I Don'T Have
An Ax.

Look,
I Was At Meagan'S House.

We Were Watching A Movie.
I Fell Asleep.

You Were Supposed To Be Studying
For Your Psats.

Mama,
I'Ve Been Varsity

Since Sophomore Year.

I Got A 4.1 Average.

What Would Be Enough?

Getting Appointed
To The Cabinet?

Oh, No, No.

Then It Would Be What?

"You'Re Only Secretary
Of Transportation.

If You Worked A Little Harder,
You Would Have Gotten State."

[ Telephone Rings ]

Hello.

O-Okay.
Uh, I'Ll Be Right There.

What'S Wrong?

<I> Janelle</I>
<I> Is All Over The Place.</I>

<I> One Minute,</I>
<I> She'S Studying Stained Glass.</I>

<I> Then She'S Studying</I>
<I> Real Estate.</I>

<I> She Studies Everything</I>

<I> Except What'S Going On</I>
<I> Right In Front Of Her.</I>

Shanice, Come Help Me
With George Washington.

This Is So Stupid.

No, It Isn'T.

All Holidays Deserve
To Be Acknowledged,

And Not Least
The Birth Of Our Country.

Our Country
Can Go Screw Itself.

If This Is Another Tantrum
About Boarding School,

I'Ve Told You,
We Can'T Afford It.

It'S Not Your Money.

George Owns Like A Gazillion
Apartment Buildings Anyway.

If I Said We Can'T Afford It,
We Can'T Afford It.

George: Afford What?

Your Stepdaughter
Wants To Go To Exeter

In New Hampshire.

It'S Expensive,
But It'S Awesome.

They Have, Like, Two Orchestras
And A Planetarium.

It'S Not About The Money,
Shanice.

We'D Miss You --
Miss Seeing You Grow Up.

You'Re Already 15.

You'Ll Be Leaving For College
Soon.

Well, If My Dad Were Alive,
He'D Take Care Of Me.

[ "Yankee Doodle" Ringtone
Plays ]

[ Cellphone Beeps ]

Hi, Daddy.
Everything Okay?

Cecil:
<I>Your Mama'S In The Hospital.</I>
<I> Had Another Attack.</I>

I'Ll Be There
In 10 Minutes.

[ Buzzes ]

Viola:<I> Teachers Said</I>
<I> Lewis Is A Genius,</I>

<I> I.Q. Of 146.</I>

Step To The Window.

<I> But I'Ve Never</I>
<I> Seen Him Use It.</I>

I Don'T See A Lot Of
Existentialists Coming Through.

Yeah, Well,
Man Is Condemned To Be Free.

Let'S Not
See You Back Here.

Tell Me About It.

Donnetta: What The Hell Happened
To You This Time, Lewis?

You Had A Scheduled Visit
With Your Son Yesterday.

Yes, Donnetta,
I Know That.

I Got Called In To Work.
What Do You Want Me To Do?

But I'M On My Way To Your House
Right Now.

"Work." Yeah, Right.

Drunk And Disorderly
Or Breaking And Entering?

Don'T Set Foot
On My Driveway

Without A Check
For Back Child Support.

Just Put Jimar
On The Phone

So I Can Explain To Him
What'S What.

He'S Out With Todd.

So When Will He Be Back?

[ Beeps ]

Just Tell Jimar
I'Ll Call Him Back, All Right?

[ Cellphone Beeps ]

Dad, What Is It?

Mm.

Mama'S Awake!

<I> Surprised?</I>

Hey, Mama.
How You Doing?

Hey, Mama.

You Look Good,
Mama.

How Are You Feeling, Vy?

<I> You Tore My Heart Out.</I>

<I> Now I'M Laying Here</I>
<I> Without My Good Wig.</I>

<I> How Do You Think I Feel?</I>

She'S Looking
At You

Like She Wants To Stab You
With A Pitchfork.

No, She Isn'T.

That'S Just Her Normal
Facial Expression.

You Know She Has
Bitchy Resting Face.

Paris,
She'S Asthmatic, Not Deaf.

I'D Be Looking At Daddy
That Way, Too.

This Is The Third Attack
She'S Had

Since He Up
And Abandoned Her.

This Is Neither The Time
Nor The Place

To Get Into That,
Charlotte.

Oh, Please, Paris.
Do Not Tell Me What To Do.

This Is Not
Some Fancy Catering Job

Where You Can Just Snap Your
Fingers And The Waiters Jump.

Okay?
This Is About My Mother!

<I> The Last Time</I>
<I> You Hung Up On Me,</I>

<I> You Told Me I Never Was</I>
<I>And Never Would Be Your Mother.</I>

Are You
Capital "C" Crazy?

The Way
You Treat Her --

The Two Of You
Are Barely Even Speaking.

You Want Cause And Effect?
Look In The Mirror.

I'M Not The Pack A Day
That Mama Smoked
For The Past 30 Years!

So Now You'Re Blaming Me
For Her Asthma?!

Can You Believe This,
Lewis?!

I Don'T Know,
Charlotte.

When Was The Last Time You
And Mama Did Anything But Fight?

Spoken By A Man
That Would Smoke
His Mama'S Ashes

If He Thought
It Would Get Him High.

Your Fighting
Is Just As Stressful For Mama

As Lewis' Drinking,

And Stress Isn'T Good
For One'S Health.

And You Married A Creepy Guy
That Pays Your Rent.

You Don'T Think That'S Stressful
For Her? Really?

<I> Yeah, She'S Got A Point.</I>

Look, All Of This Carrying On --
That'S What'S Stressful.

Now, Can We At Least
Give Your Mother

Some Peace And Harmony,
Please?

No, Daddy.

You Do Not Get To Toss 38 Years
Of Marriage Into The Trash

And Talk To Us Like You Are
Jesus Come Down From The Cross.

Mm.
Daddy Didn'T Toss Anything
Anywhere.

They'Re Just Going Through
One Of Their Rough Patches.

You And Mom Are Gonna
Work This Out, Right, Daddy?

[ Groans ]

Cecil:
I Don'T Think So, Baby Girl.

Oh, For God'S Sake,
Janelle,

Quit Being
So Clueless!

It'S Over!

And Really And Truly,
It'S About Time.

Some Marriages
Are Just Born To Die.

Oh, There You Go.

There You Go With Your
Picture-Perfect Marriage.

Compared To You,
Pining After A Deadbeat

Who Took A Better Offer
10 Years Ago.

Janelle:
How Can You Be So Mean?!

Lewis:
Yeah, Charlotte.

You Know Paris Kicked
Nathan Out On His Ass.

Oh, So Everybody'S
Ganging Up On Me Now?!

Who'S Ganging Up
On You?!

I Should Be Used To It
By Now.

[ All Shouting Indistinctly ]

[ Whistles ]
That'S Enough!

Yo! That'S Enough!

You Got The People In
The Parking Lot Taking Sides.

Dr. Cielto,
I'M Sorry.

We Prices
Are Very Passionate People.

Well, Get Passionate
Someplace Else.

I'M About To Take That Tube
Out Of Vy'S Throat,

And I'D Like Her To Be
Reasonably Calm When I Do It.

I'Ll Call And Let You Know
How She'S Doing.

Come On.

Sorry, Mama.
Okay, Mama.

Dr. Cielto: You Don'T Need Me
To Dance Around It.

Your Condition
Is Deteriorating.

How Bad?

You Got A Birthday
Coming Up This Month,

A Big, Round Number?

It'S A Little Too Big
And Too Round.

Maybe It'S Time
For That Paris-Themed Shindig

You'Re Always Saying
You'Re Gonna Throw Next Year

With The Whole Family
And All Your Friends.

Are You Saying
I'M Out Of Next Years?

The Tests Are Showing

That Fluid Is Accumulating
Around The Heart.

There'S A High Risk
Of Congestive Heart Failure.

It'S 30 Years Of Smoking,
Vy.

I Was Gonna Ask You
To Go To The Gift Shop

And Get Me A Pack
Of Marlboro.

If You Want, I'Ll, Uh --

I'Ll Talk To Your Family
About Options.

Not Yet.

There'S A Whole Lot Of Mess
I Got To Clean Up Before I Go.

I Can'T Have Them Killing
Each Other After I'M Gone,

So I Got To Go.

Vy, You'Re Not Going Anywhere
Right Now.

Just Rest.

You<I> Rest.</I>
[ Sighs ]

<I> I Am Just Now Waking Up.</I>

Mama, Did You Give Me
Your Prescriptions?

Yeah,
All Seven Of Them.

Shanice,
Hop In The Front.

You Can Get Started
On The Groceries

While I Get
The Prescription.

You Know What?

Why Don'T You Let Me
Take Shanice With Me?

I Could Use Some Help
Inside.

Okay.

Come On,
You With The Long Face.

Come On And Help Granny.

<I> I Have So Much To See About</I>
<I>Where This Family Is Concerned,</I>

<I> So I Might As Well</I>
<I> Get Started</I>

<I> By Finding Out What'S Going On</I>
<I> Under That Damn Hat.</I>

Paramedics Got Dirt
All Over The Rug.

And They Trampled My Tulips,
Too.

But I'M Still Here.

You Okay, Granny?

I Could Ask You
The Same Question.

Are You Okay?

'Cause I Noticed
You And This Hat

Seemed To Have Developed
Quite A Relationship.

Come On. Take It Off.
It'S A Thousand Degrees Outside.

No.

You'D Say No
To Your Granny?

I Don'T Care Who You Are.

I'M Sick Of People
Telling Me What To Do.

Hey!

[ Sighs ]

Look At Me.

Look At Me!

Sorry, Granny.

Of Course
I Took Her To The Doctor.

He Said Kids Act Out,

Especially When They'Ve Lost
A Parent To Violence.

Jimmy Died When She Was A Baby.
What Are You Talking About?

And Now She'S A Teenager.

Not All Teenagers
Pull Out Their Hair.

It'S Got To Be
Something Else.

Is It Boys?
Is It Drugs?

You Know, If You Need Parenting
Advice On A Wayward Child,

Talk
To Your Sister Charlotte.

She Tracks Those Kids
Like Packages.

And They'Re Still Brats.

Well, Tiffany'S Nice.

Is Everything Okay
With You And George?

[ Sighs ]
George And I Are Fine.

Just Because You'Re Still Bitter
About You And Daddy

Doesn'T Mean
All Husbands Are Bad.

I'M Just Saying

Something Is Eating
At Your Child,

And You Need To Open Your Eyes
And Pay Attention.

Shanice
Has Track Practice.

Mm-Hmm.

Your Groceries
Are In The Fridge.

Mm-Hmm.

Call Me
If You Need Anything.

No Kiss?

Mm-Hmm.

<I> Just Because</I>
<I>Janelle Doesn'T Want To Hear It</I>

<I> Doesn'T Mean</I>
<I> I'M Going To Stop Talking.</I>

[ Car Door Closes ]

<I> But Right Now</I>
<I> I See A Little Something</I>

<I> I'D Like To Plant Myself.</I>

[ Engine Turns Over ]
[ Telephone Beeps, Speed Dials ]

Hello!

Good Morning,
Mrs. Price.

Paris: Hello?

Hello. Paris?

Hey, Mama.

You Need To Drop
Whatever Pot You'Re Stirring

And Get Your Behind Over Here,
And I Mean But Quick.

Nothing To Drop.
I'M Five Blocks Away.
Is Everything Okay?

I Can'T Speak
For Everything,

But Some Things
Could Not Be Finer.

Hurry Up Now, Hear?

Okay.

[ Telephone Beeps ]

[ Groans ]

[ Wheezes, Coughs ]

[ Groans, Coughs ]

Let Me Get That For You,
Mrs. Price.

[ Inhaler Hisses ]

Oh, Would You, Please?
Thank You So Much.

Mama Wouldn'T Forgive Me
If I Didn'T.

Uh, It'S Randall,
Right?

Yes, Ma'Am.
That'S Right.

Where Would You Like Me
To Take This?

Oh, Just Right Over There
In The Sun.

All Right.
More Sun, More Blossoms.

That'S What They Say.

Oh, Paris! I Didn'T Know
You Were Coming Over.

Come On. I Want To Introduce You
To Randall.

[ Car Door Closes ]

Randall,
This Is My Daughter Paris.

Paris,
This Is Randall.

Nice To Meet You.
Hey, Nice --

You Know, She'S Always Saying
She Wants To Find

A Really Good Landscape Artist,
And I Thought Of You

Because Of The Beautiful Job
That You'Ve Done

Right Over There
At The Simpsons'.

Mom, Please.
I'M Just Saying.

And I Think
That You Should Exchange Cards.

Oh, Great Idea.
Yeah. I Got One Right Here.

How About A Consult?

Uh, I Got Nothing To Do
Tomorrow,

If You Don'T Mind
Doing It On A Sunday.

[ Chuckles ] Well, You Know,
I-I Really Don'T Know.

[ Laughs ]
She'Ll Be Ready At 10:00 A.M.

Oh. 10:00.

All Right.
That Sounds Good.

I'Ll See You Then.
All Right.

Mm-Hmm.

And Put Your Coffee Grounds
On The Soil.

More Acid,
More Blossoms.

So Embarrassing.
What'S Gotten In To You?

Would You Just Say
Thank You?

"Thank You, Mama,
For Thinking Of Me."

Have You Heard
From Your Brother?

Not Since The Hospital.

I Made You
A Kale/Grapefruit Tonic.

I'M Gonna Go Put It
In The Fridge.

Great. Thank You.

[ Dialing ]

<I> Two Down.</I>

[ Cellphone Ringtone Playing ]

[ Playing Continues ]

[ Telephone Beeps ]

Lewis.

Lewis.
[ Snores ]

[ Groans ]

Oh.
Mm.

Hey, Mama.
[ Groans ]

You Smell Like
A Distillery.

[ Coughs ]

Why Are You Sleeping
In My Car?

Mine Got Impounded,

And It Was Too Late
To Ring The Doorbell, So...

What Time Is It?

I Don'T Know.

Come On.
I'Ll Make You Some Breakfast.

All Right.

You Got Evicted.
Seriously, Lewis.

You Know, You Don'T Have To Stay
In The Same Room With A Derelict

If You Don'T Want To,
Paris.

You'Re Welcome To Cast
Your Aspersions Elsewhere.

Paris,
Will You Do Me A Favor, Please?

Will You Go Up To My Room,
Get My Yellow Pills?

They'Re On The Vanity.

Thank You.

When Was The Last Time
You Saw Your Son, Lewis?

[ Sighs ]

Come On, Mama.

You Can'T Be Any Harder On Me
Than I Am On Myself.

Well, What Are You Gonna Do
About It?

I Don'T Know.

Maybe It'S Better
That I Stay Away.

I'M Not Exactly A Good Example,
If You Know What I Mean.

Now You'Re Just Making Excuses
To Stay Away From Your Son.

I Let Your Father
Get Away With That.

Well,
At Least Daddy Was A Provider.

Yes,
Your Father Was Motivated.

And You -- You Were Not
Motivated In School.

You Weren'T Motivated
In Your Marriage.

And Now You'Re Not Motivated
In Your Son'S Life.

Let Me Tell You, Boy,

You Better Find That Motivation
Because Time'S A-Wasting.

[ Sighs ]

[ Telephone Rings ]

I Got It!

[ Telephone Beeps ]
Hello?

What Are You Doing There?

[ Groans ]
Checking In On Our Mother.

What Are You Doing
That'S More Important?

Go To Hell.

But First,
Put Mama On The Phone,

And Then Go To Hell.

It'S Your
Second-Born Beast.

I Heard That, Bitch.

<I> I Remember When Charlotte</I>

<I> Had Real Sweet Parts On Her.</I>

<I> I Plan To See Those Again.</I>

Charlotte,
Hold On A Second, Baby.

I'M Gonna Call You Later,
Mama.

Hold Up. I Need A Ride.

Oh, You Need
A Getaway Driver?

Very Funny, Paris.

I'M Going To The Employment
Office, All Right?

Mama,
What You Doing?

What'S With You?

Nothing.
Can'T I Just Kiss My Kids?

[ Both Laugh ]

Charlotte: Mom, Did You Forget
About Me?!

Mama!

Hey, Charlotte.

Listen, Are You Coming Over
Like I Asked You To?

'Cause I Need Some Help.
With What?

I'M Throwing Myself
A Birthday Party,


And I Want You To Help
With The Decorations.

I Can'T! I'M Working!

I'Ve Got Two Kids
Who Soak Up Money,

A Spoiled Husband

Who Wants A Sunday Dinner
On A Wednesday.

[ Telephone Beeps ]
<I>I'Ve Got A Growing Business</I>
<I> To Run,</I>

A Home To Keep Up
All By My Damn Self.

I Wish I Had Time
For Your Fancy, Little Parties.

Maybe You Ought To Try A Little
Anger Management, Sweetie.

Look, Mama,
I Do Not Need Anger Management.

What I Need
Are More Hours In The Day

And For People
To Stay Off My Back.

You Know, You'Re Starting
To Sound An Awful Lot Like Me.

Yeah, I Don'T Want To Have This
Conversation With You Right Now.

Yeah, Well,
Perhaps You Need To.

'Cause If You'Re Not
Careful,

You'Re Gonna End Up
Driving Al Away

And Wake Up One Day
And Be All Alone --

I Mean All Alone.

Mark My Words.

Mama,

Are You Talking About Me And Al
Or You And Dad?

[ Telephone Beeps ]
[ Sighs ]

<I> Cecil --</I>

<I> Truth Is,</I>
<I> I Pushed Him Away.</I>

<I> And Ain'T This The Bitch?</I>
<I> I Need Him Now.</I>

How You Doing?

[ Brakes Screech ]

How You Doing?

Where Is Cecil?

Nice To See You, Too, Vy.

Heard You Were
In The Hospital.

You Look Good, Though.

Being Single Put A Whole
New Plush In Them Cheeks.

Where Is My Husband?

He Said
He Was Having Lunch In The Park.

Be About An Hour.

You Can Hang With Me
Till Then.

Howie, You'Ve Been Wasting
That Charm On Me

For 20 Years.

[ Tires Screeching ]

<I> Either Cecil Joined</I>
<I> Big Brothers</I>

<I> Or This Is Bad News.</I>

I'Ve Got Presents!

[ Laughs ]

Mwah!

Hey, Hey!

<I> Brenda Williams,</I>
<I> The Welfare Hussy?</I>

<I> At Least Now I Know What Woke</I>
<I> Cecil Up All Of A Sudden.</I>

Come Listen
To The Baby.

Hey.

You Look Good, Donnetta.

Well, I'D Look A Lot Better
With A Check In My Hand.

And I'D Look Like A Movie Star
With A Check In Mine.

But Just Because
A Man Doesn'T Have One

Doesn'T Mean
He Can'T See His Son.

Donnetta: According To The Law,
It Does.

No, Donnetta
No, Lewis Is Right.

How You Doing, Buddy?

Hey.

Us Fathers Got
To Stick Together, Right?

Yeah, Right, Todd.

However,
You Did Miss

A Few Scheduled Visits
With Jimar,

And We Just
Can'T Have That.

Kids Need Structure.

Yeah, You Can'T Just Show Up
At Our Home Unannounced, Lewis.

Well, Let'S Let Jimar Decide.
Jimar.

Jimar,
Come On Out, Son.

Jimar,
It'S Your Dad.

[ Baby Cries ]

Jimar.

I Guess He'S Just A Stickler
For Rules, Too, Huh?

[ Doorbell Rings ]

Hey.

Amazing Place
You Have Here.

I Am So Sorry.

I-I Should Have Called
To Cancel.

I'Ve Got So Much Going On With
My Book And My Mother'S Party,

So, Uh, Why Don'T You Just
Tell Me Your Hourly Rate And --

Oh, Really, Don'T --
Don'T Even Think Of It.

It'S Totally Fine.

But I Dragged You Out Here
On A Sunday.

My Mom
Has My Daughter Today.

I Didn'T Have
Anything Else Planned.

And It'S Worth The Trip

Just To Look At A Beautiful,
Blank Canvas Like That.

May I?

Yeah. Sure.

Wow. This Is Amazing.

This Is Beautiful.
Gosh.

Oh, Man.

Possibilities.

You Don'T Think
It'S Hopelessly Flat And Boring?

No Way.

You Haul
Three Standing Stones

Under That Japanese Maple
Over There

And Rake Some Gravel
Around It,

You Can Totally Rip Off
My Favorite Garden In The World.

Three Standing Stones?

Are You Talking About
Shunmyo Masuno Samukawa Shrine

In The Kanagawa
Prefecture?

Yes, I Am.
[ Laughs ]

I Worship Shunmyo Masuno.

I Know What Shunmyo Masuno
Had For Breakfast.

You Make A Waterfall Against
That Wall, And You'D Have --

The Saiken-Ji Temple
In Shizuoka.

And With The Geometric Path
Running Out To It --

Totally The Courtyard

He Made For The Foreign Ministry
Of Tokyo.

If You Wanted To Go All The Way,
You Know What You'D Do?

Oh, Yeah.

Streambed With A Bridge
Carved Out Of Rock.

Like That Hotel He Did
In Singapore.

The One With The Running Water
Over The Mossy Stone.

Like Silk Over Velvet.

I-I'M -- I'M Not --
I'M Not Really Sure

That I Have Space
In My Life

For Something Big A-And,
Um, New Right -- Right Now.

But If You --

If You Can Draw Up
Some Sketches For Me,

Maybe We Can, Um --

Take It Slow.

Yes. Slow.

Slow Is Good.

Would Coming By Tomorrow
To Take Some Measurements

Be Too Un-Slow?

No.

Tomorrow
Would Be Just Fine.

<I> As Much</I>
<I> As I'M Looking Forward</I>

<I> To My Big,</I>
<I> Parisian Birthday Party,</I>

<I> I'Ve Got Some Cecil Business</I>
<I> To Attend To.</I>

[ Groans, Exhales Sharply ]

<I> This Hat Might Be</I>
<I> A Little Much For Church,</I>

<I> But, Heck, I'M Not Gonna</I>
<I> Save It For My Funeral.</I>

Â™ª Open Up Your Guards Â™ª

Â™ª Your Mighty Gates Â™ª

Â™ª Let The Lord Of Hosts
Come Marching In Â™ª

Â™ª Open Up Your Hearts Â™ª

Â™ª Throw Away The Locks Â™ª

Â™ª Let The Heavens' Rain Â™ª

Â™ª Wash Away Your Sins Â™ª

Â™ª Gonna Sing It High Â™ª

Â™ª Gonna Sing It Low Â™ª

Â™ª Gonna Name His Name Â™ª

Â™ª So You Will Know Â™ª

Â™ª Gonna Sing It High,
Gonna Sing It... Â™ª

So, I See You Finally Got The
Courage To Face Daddy, Huh?

This Has Nothing To Do
With Your Father.

This Is About
My Spiritual Rebuilding.

<I> I'Ve Heard A Thing Or Two</I>
<I> About Ms. Brenda Williams.</I>

<I> Hard For Me To Believe</I>
<I> That Cecil'S Truck</I>

<I> Is The Only Thing</I>
<I> She'S Been Riding.</I>

Â™ª Stop Asking Why Â™ª

Â™ª Stop Saying It Â™ª

Â™ª Lift Up Those Gates Â™ª

Â™ª Lift Them Up On High Â™ª

Â™ª Cry Out His Name Â™ª

Â™ª And Hear My Cry Â™ª

[ Cheers And Applause ]

Woman: Yes, Yes! Amen!
Yes, Yes!

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

And Tiffany Has A Dentist'S
Appointment Tomorrow At 11:00,

So I'M Gonna Need You
To Pick Her Up From School

And Then Drop Her Back Off
When It'S Over.

No, I Can'T.

I'M Going Fishing
With Smitty Tomorrow.

What,
So You'Re Gonna Leave Me

To Do Everything By Myself,
As Usual?

Look, If I Had Known There Was
A Dentist'S Appointment,

I Wouldn'T Have Made
Plans.

Well, Now You Know.

I Mean,
Sorry About Smitty'S Luck,

But You'Re Gonna Have
To Cancel.

I Ain'T Canceling.

So You'Re Just Gonna Have
A Grown-Man Playdate,

And That'S All There Is
To It?

Look, Reasonable Women --

They Communicate
With Their Husbands.

They Don'T Give Them
A Hard Time

For What They Do
On Their Days Off.

Smitty'S Wife --
She Don'T Care.

Well, Glory Be
To Smitty'S Perfect Wife.

I'Ll Go Pick Up
The Kids.

Oh, Al --

Listen, Whatever You Just Did
To Make Him Mad,

Go Apologize.

Mama, How Do You Know
It'S My Fault?

Because You'Re Breathing.

Now,
Whatever You Have To Do,

You Got To Feed Him Or,
You Know, The...

You Know.

Don'T Look At Me Like That.
Mama, We Are In Church.

I'M Just Saying,

Whatever You Have To Do,
Just Take Care Of It.

And Don'T Leave It
For Too Long, Okay? Go.

[ Sighs ]

[ Indistinct Conversations ]

Woman:
Hi! Hey! Hey!

<I> When You Want Information</I>
<I> Around This Place,</I>

<I> There'S Only One Place</I>
<I> To Get It.</I>

Hey!

Hello,
Sister Violet.

Oh, It'S So Nice
To See The Two Of You Again.

And May I Say
That Voice Of Yours --

It'S Like
An Angel Is Singing.

Oh, Sister Vy,
It'S Nice To Have You Back.

Well,
It'S Never A Bad Idea

To Spend A Little Time
In The House Of The Lord.

Mm-Hmm.

But I Have To Tell You,

I'M Thinking Of Finding
Another Place Of Worship.

Oh, Sister Vy,

We'Re Really Sorry
To Hear About You Two.

Yeah.

We'Re Praying
For Brother Cecil.

Well, It Appears That Your
Prayers Have Been Answered.

The Lord Hasn'T Seen Fit
To Leave Him Lonely For Long.

Brenda Williams
As An Instrument Of The Lord?

Mm-Hmm.
Now, That'S Something

I Never Thought
That I Would Hear.

Excuse Me, Ladies.

Cecil.

Vy, A Word, Please.

Oh, Sure.

Excuse Me.

[ Indistinct Conversations ]

I Just Want You To Know
That What I Have With Brenda --

It Started
After We Split.

No, It Didn'T.

A Man
Doesn'T Abandon Ship

Unless He Knows He Has
A Lifeboat Waiting In The Wings.

But I Don'T Care
About Any Of That.

What I Care About

Is That You Remember
You Have Your Own Family.

The Kids Don'T Need
My Paychecks Anymore.

No. But They'Re Going To Need
Your Love.

They Always Had My Love.

What'S Different Now?

What'S Wrong, Vy?
What -- What'S Going On?

What'S Up?
Nothing.

There'S Nothing Up.

But You'Re Not Getting
Any Younger.

I Just Want To Make Sure

That You Spend Some Time
With Your Kids,

Be A Father
To Your Kids.

Is That A Bad Thing
To Say?

Okay.

I'Ll Be Seeing You.

[ Sighs ]

So, What Is It You Were
About To Tell Me About, Uh --

Brenda Williams.
Brenda Williams.

That Maybe She Started
Coming To Church With Cecil...

Mm-Hmm.
...But That Doesn'T Mean

That She Did It
For The Salvation
Of Her Eternal Soul.

Geraldine,
The Lord Doesn'T Like Gossips.

It Is Said That It'S Not Gossip
If It'S True

And You Don'T Take
Any Pleasure In It.

Mm-Hmm.

Sister Vy,
There'S So Much To Say,

I Don'T Know
Where To Start.

[ Rapping ]
Â™ª I Do What I Do Â™ª

Â™ª Yes, I Be Who I Be Â™ª

Â™ª And Trust
I Live How I Live... Â™ª

Shanice, Why Aren'T You Dressed
For Track?

George Is Waiting
To Take You To Practice.

I'M Not Going Today.

You Can'T Just Not Go.
Your Team Is Counting On You.

Well,
They Can Count On Somebody Else.

What Do You Want,
Shanice?

Granny Thinks There'S Something
Going On With You,

Something Hurtful.

Â™ª Yeah, It Is What It Is,
And Still I Am Who I Am Â™ª

Is Somebody Bothering You
At School?

Granny'S On Too Much
Medication.

I'Ll Go
To The Stupid Track Practice.

Well...Hurry.

Â™ª He Could Be A Star
In The Morning Â™ª

Â™ª But The Night'S Mine
And This Is... Â™ª

How Long
Is The Seminar?

Just A Couple Hours.

There'S A Mixer Afterwards.

Lots Of Connected
Real-Estate Agents.

Then We'Ll Be Home Before You,
Then.

Oh, Yeah.
Ice Cream For Dinner!

No, You Can'T.

Shanice
Is In One Of Her Moods.

Do Not Let Her Con You
Into Skipping Track

And Going To Sizzler.

Mm-Hmm. Mwah!

Shanice,
I'Ll Wait For You In The Car.

[ Chuckles ]

[ Cellphone Beeps ]

Call Charlotte.

[ Cellphone Rings ]

Mm.
[ Telephone Beeps ]

Yeah.

I Need Parenting Advice.

What A Surprise,

Janelle Calling
When She Needs Something.

Charlotte --

All Right, All Right.

Just Make It Snappy.
I'M Busy Ignoring Al.

Shanice Has Been Acting
Squirrelly,

And She Won'T Tell Me Why.

Mama Even Gave Her
The Third Degree.

Mm! She Dove Into My Business
Yesterday.

Me, Too!

She Hasn'T Done That
In Years.

Anyway,
Shanice Didn'T Crack.

Whoa. That'S Big.

So What Did You Find
In Her Room?

I Can'T Go Through
Her Room.

That -- That'S An Invasion
Of Privacy.

It'S A Parental
Necessity.

I Do It
At Least Once A Month.

No!

Janelle, It'S Not...

I Was Rubbing Her Shoulder.
It Was Sore From Track.

Out.

Out.

Out!

Baby...

Get Away From Me.

Get Out!
Get Out, Get Out!

Get Out!
Get Out, Get Out! Out!

Get Out!

[ Sobs ]

[ Sighs ]
Where Are You Going?

To The Bathroom
To Wipe My Ass,

If That'S Okay With You,
Charlotte.

And Then I'M Gonna Go Pack
For My Fishing Trip With Smitty.

Look, Al,
I Know You'Re Mad At Me,

But You Don'T
Have To Be Stink About It.

Well,
Now You Know How It Feels.

<I> Charlotte May Yell And Scream,</I>

<I> But She Listens.</I>

[ Dialing ]

[ Ringing ]
[ Sighs ]

Lela: Hello.

Hey, Lela,
It'S Charlotte.

I'M So Sorry
For Calling So Early,

But I Wanted To Make

My Special
Buttermilk Fried Chicken

For Al And Smitty'S
Fishing Trip Today.

Is Smitty Still Watching
His Cholesterol?

What Fishing Trip?

Smitty'S Chained To The House
Today.

He Promised
He'D Paint The Basement.

He'S Not Going Anywhere.

Thank You.

[ Knock On Door ]

Shanice, He'S Gone.

He Didn'T Come Back
Last Night.

I Hope He Never Does.

C-Can I Come In?

Shanice:
It'S Unlocked.

Shanice,
Please Stop Doing That.

Baby,
I Am So Sorry.

Why?

At Least
He Was Generous.

Look At All This Stuff.

I Clean Up.

[ Sniffles ]

Who Are You Calling?

They Said The Detective
That Handles These Things

Would Be In At 9:00.

No Police Ever.

I'M Not Gonna Let Him
Get Away With This.

If You Tell The Cops,
I'M Gonna Say That You'Re Lying,

That You'Re Pissed
Because He'S Leaving You.

Why?

Why Would You Do That?

Nobody Can Find Out.

I Don'T Want Anyone
To Know.

Shanice.

Baby.

You -- You Have To Let Me
Help You.

What Am I Supposed
To Do?

Nothing, Mom.

That Should Be Really Easy
For You.

You'Ve Been Doing It
For Years.

Brenda: Why Does Viola
Want To See You?

Didn'T You Tell Her Everything
You Had To In Church?

She Probably
Wants To Talk About The Kids.

She Wants To Talk To You About
Your Grown-Ass Children?

They'Re Older Than Me.

Why Don'T I Take
You And The Kids

To Red Lobster Tonight?

So You Can Let Me Down Easy?

So I Can Do What Now?

[ Chuckles ]

I'M Not Stupid, Cecil,
And I'M Not Weak.

I Can Take Care Of Myself,
My Kids

If I Have To.

I Just Need To Know,
Do You Still Have

One Foot In Another Door?

I Have Both Feet Planted
Right Here, Brenda.

I'M Not Going Anywhere.

Yeah? We'Ll See.

Kids, Wash Your Hands
And Get To The Kitchen

For Something To Eat!

Let'S Get Married.

Kids,
Stay In That Bedroom

Until I Tell You
Different.

Are You Sure?

I Want To Be A Real Daddy.

I Want To Be A Real Daddy
To All Of You.

Let'S Get Married.

You'D Have To Get A Divorce
First.

I Wish I Had A Ring
Right Now.

[ Sighs ]

Yes, Yes.

[ Laughs ] Yes, Yes.

Oh!

Lewis,
What Are You Still Doing Here?

Didn'T I Tell You
You Had To Leave?

Mama, I Move Very Carefully
When Money'S Involved.

You Know Your Father'S
On His Way Over Here,

And I Have To Talk
To Him.

Yeah, And Believe Me,
I Want To Get Going,

But It Was My Last $20.

All Right, Look.

I Have $50
In My Dresser Drawer.

Take It.
Fix My Carburetor.

Stay Out Of The House
For The Rest Of The Day

And Maybe
Go See Your Son.

What Do You Think
Of That?

Why Are You Planning
Your Funeral?

'Cause I'M Old,
And That'S What Old People Do.

You'Re Only 59 Years Old,

And You Have A Circle Around
A Dynasty Copper Casket?

You Know,
Now Is Not The Best Time

For You To Start Using
Your Intelligence.

Move.

[ Sighs ]

This Is Not The Time
For Laundry.

You Know, You Need To Have
A Little More Respect For Me

When I'M Folding
Your Underwear.

[ Sighs ]

Why Didn'T You Tell Us?

I Can'T Get You All In The Same
Room For Five Minutes Together

Without
You Tearing Each Other Apart.

And That'S Why
Daddy'S Coming Over --

So You Can Tell Him?
No.

I Don'T Plan To Tell Him.

I Don'T Plan To Tell
Your Sisters.

And Neither Will You.

If One Of Us Kept Something
Like That From You,

You Would Never
Forgive Us.

Lewis, I Promise You
I Will Tell Everybody Soon.

You Have To Tell Them.
Lewis.

I Will Tell Them Soon.

[ Sighs ]

How Long Do You Have?

What,
To Get All This Folded?

Come On. Help Me.
Come On, Now.

I Don'T Know What This Boy Has
Against Garbage Bins.

Mom, It'S Not What
It Looks Like.

Well, I Thought It Was You
Having Sex

In The Backseat Of My Car
During Your Lunch Break,

But If It Wasn'T,
Please Enlighten Me.

W-We Were Just Kissing.

You See, Dingus, This Is What
I'M Talking About -- The Lies.

Now, Where Do Your Parents
Think You Are Right Now?

At School.

Mm-Hmm. More Lies.

Okay, Look, Mom,
It'S Not That Big Of A Deal.

It Will Be
When She'S Pregnant.

And I Know
Your Parents Don'T Want

Some Little
Kinky-Headed Grandchild

From Their 16-Year-Old
Daughter!

Whoa, Whoa!
Okay, Look, Mom, Take It Easy.

I Wish I Could, Dingus.

I Wish That I Could Take My Eyes
Off Of You For One Minute!

Why Don'T You Leave My Son Alone
So He Can Fulfill His Potential?

One Wrong Move And He Doesn'T
End Up In Daddy'S Mailroom.

He Ends Up In Jail.

Holy Crap.

Mom, You Can'T Talk To People
Like That.

It'S No Wonder
Why No One Wants To Be With You.

I Just Did That Girl
A Favor.

You'Re Not Ready
To Be Playing House.

You'Re Not Ready
To Be With Anyone.

You Know,
Your Father Was The Same Way.

Thought He Could Just Skate By
On Charm Forever.

I Am Trying To Raise You

So That You Don'T Run Out
When Things Get Tough,

So That You Don'T
Turn Into A Selfish Prick

Who Abandons The People
Who Love Him!

I Am Not Dad.

Not Yet.

Didn'T Anyone Teach You
Not To Sneak Up On People?

I'M Sorry. I Didn'T Realize
You Were -- You Were --

Yeah,
I Guess You Didn'T.

All Right, Look, I'M Just --
I'M Just Gonna Head Out Back

And, Um, Get Started
With The Measurements.

<I> Getting</I>
<I> That Dã©jã  Vu Feeling?</I>

<I> That'S French For</I>
<I>"You'Ve Seen This Crap Before."</I>

<I> I Told Charlotte</I>
<I> She'S Got More Of Me In Her</I>

<I> Than She'D Like To Admit.</I>

I Knew He Wasn'T Done
With That Bitch.

<I>But There Is One Big Difference</I>
<I> Between Her And Me --</I>

<I> You Don'T See Charlotte</I>
<I>Staying Put Behind A Damn Tree.</I>

Albert St. Charles!

You Are
A Dirty Liar...

Get Him Out.

...And A Cheat.

You Said That You Would
Never See That Hussy Again.

You Promised!

Charlotte, Let'S Just Go
Somewhere, And Let'S Talk, Okay?

I Am Not Going
Anywhere.

Who'S That Boy?

Charlotte, I Ended That Affair
10 Years Ago,

Just Like I Said.

Whose Son Is That?

He'S Mine.

Look, He'S Mine.

So Let'S Just Go Home,
And Let'S Talk About This, Okay?

Home.

Right.

My Home.

You Don'T Live There
Anymore.

Charlotte!

Charlotte!

Corelli: So, The Rape Occurred
Last Night?

I Found Out.

I Found Them Yesterday.

It Started Before.

When?

I Don'T Know When.

I Know Who --
My Husband, George Porter.

He Runs The Division
At The Airport.

He'S A Captain.

Your Husband'S
A Police Officer?

Yes.

We Need A Statement
From Your Daughter,

And Tha Warrant.Issue
No.

She'Ll Only
Have To Do It Once.

It'S All Coordinated --
Social Services, The D.A.

She Won'T.    We Can Come
To Your House.

S-She Just Won'T --
She Won'T Talk To You.

She Won'T Talk To Me.

S-She Won'T Let Me
Hold Her.

I-I Need
To Help My Daughter.

Mrs. Porter --
Don'T Call Me That.

We Can'T Go After Him

Without Talking
To Your Daughter.

Because He'S A Cop?

Because It'S Your Word
Against His.

Either Your Husband
Or Your Daughter Needs To Talk,

Or Else There'S No Case.

Homemade Lemonade.

Labor-Intensive
But Worth It.

Thank You.

Cheers.

Mmm.

I Like Fresh Mint.

[ Chuckles ]

So, Do We Talk
About Koi Ponds,

Or Do You Tell Me How Crazy
I Sounded Earlier Today?

Children Will Do That To You,
And Vice Versa.

I'M Not Saying

I Would Have Handled
The Situation The Same Way,

But You Got To Protect
Your Kids.

Yeah, Especially When You'Re
Doing It Alone.

But Dingus Thinks
He'S In Love.

Hit Me
'Round About The Same Age.

Too Bad
I Never Really Knew Her.

Which Is Worse --
Not Knowing Someone

Or Having Them
Completely Change On You?

They'Re Both Tough,
But The Biggest Mistake Is

To Never Try Again.

<I> Now, That Was A Dumb Move.</I>

<I> Amateur.</I>

I Should
Let You Get Back To It,

And I Shall Lock Myself
In My Lair.

My Mother'S Party Is
Saturday,

And I Still Haven'T Planned
The Menu.

So I'Ll Just Go Now.

Ooh.
Paris...

[ Laughing ]

Okay, What Are You --
What Are You On?

[ Laughing ]
What Are You Talking About?

When I Came Up The Drive,
You Were Taking --

Some Ibuprofen
For A Headache.

I'Ve Traveled A Long Way
Down That Road Myself.

I Know Over-The-Counter From
The Hard Stuff When I See It.

[ Laughs ]

I Have A Prescription
For Anxiety.

I'Ve Got It Under Control.

Words I'Ve Spoken Myself.

Paris, If You Need Help,
It'S All Around You.

I Can Take You
To A Meeting.

[ Chuckles ]

Are You My Therapist Now?
I'M A Friend.

Based On What?
Why'D You Say That?

I Barely Know You.

I Think You Should Leave.

Paris --

Yeah, Go.

Just Go.

What Did You Do
To Daddy?

He'S Fine.

I'M The One
You Should Be Worried About.

Monique: He'S Leaving
Because Of Some Stupid Thing

He Did
10 Whole Years Ago.

It'S Not Fair, Mom.

I Am Not Taking
Marriage Counseling

From A 16-Year-Old.

Here. Take This Money.

Go Buy Some Pizza
For Dinner,

And Then Go Home
And Do Your Homework.

We Can'T Do Homework
If You'Re Getting A Divorce.

Somebody Better Take This Money
From My Hand

Before I Change My Mind.

Daddy Helps Me Practice
My Flute.

Yeah,
And He Was Supposed To Help Me

Pick Out A Dress
For Granny'S Birthday.

Listen, Neither One Of You
Mentions This To Granny.

Do You Understand Me?

Why Is It A Secret?

Because It'S Our Family,

And It'S Our Business.
[ Scoffs ]

Okay, So, So,
How Are You Gonna Explain It

To Granny
When Daddy Doesn'T Show Up

To Her Big Party On Saturday,
Huh?

<I> And How Are You Gonna Hold</I>
<I> Your Perfect Marriage</I>

<I> Over Paris' Head When You Let</I>
<I> Go Of Your Husband?</I>

Mama'S In The House.

What Kind Of Mood
Is She In?

I Have Something Important
To Tell Her.

I Don'T Know.

So, Uh, You Still Working
At That Garage On Halsted?

[ Chuckles ]

I Got Laid Off
A Year Ago.

Well, I Know This Guy.
He Has A Security Outfit.

I Can See If He Needs
An Extra Hand.

That Figures.

I Tell You
I'Ve Been Let Go,

And You Assume I'Ve Been Sitting
On My Ass All This Time.

Well, Am I Wrong, Son?

No, Sir.

Unemployed, Evicted,
And Subpoenaed.

That'S Me.

Donnetta'S Taking You
To Court Again.

Back Child Support.

Man To Man, Lewis,

It'S Past Due Time
You Provided For Your Son.

I Agree, Pop.

I Mean, You Were
The Great Provider,

And Look How Well
I Turned Out.

One Finger Or Two?

Two,
Since It'S The Good Stuff.

You Only Bring That Out
For Two Reasons --

Good News And Bad News.

Which Is It?

<I> Two Of That Last One</I>

<I> If You'Re Up For Hearing</I>
<I> That I'M Dying,</I>

<I> But I'Ll Start</I>
<I> With Something Easy.</I>

Thanks.
Let'S Have It, Then.

You Know I Care About You,
Right, Cecil?

And That I Would Never Want
To See You Played.

But I'M Sorry To Tell You

You Are Not The Father
Of Brenda'S Baby.

[ Laughs ]

Come On, Vy, You Don'T Know
What You'Re Talking About.

Oh, But I Do,

And I'M About To Save You
A Whole Lot Of Heartache.

How Far Along Is She?
About Four Months?

It'S Closer To Three.

Ah.

Well, Four Months Ago --

And I Can Get You The Exact Date
If You Want --

Brenda Went To Las Vegas
With Her Second Baby Daddy.

I Know. She Told Me.
She Moved On From Him.

Well, I Don'T Know
What She Moved On From,

But A Month After That,

She Started Paying
Very Close Attention To You.

She...

Said She Wanted
Something More Stable.

And You'Ve Been Buying
Her Groceries Ever Since.

You All Right?

You Need Another One?

I'Ll See You Saturday.

What, Now, Cecil,
You Know I Would Never Be

The Bearer Of Bad News
If I Didn'T Have To Be.

I Just --
[ Door Slams ]

[ Sighs ]

No, No, No, No, No, No.
Thinner, Thinner --

I Need To Be Able To Read
A Newspaper Through It.

[ Telephone Rings ]

<I> Bonjour,</I> Paris.
[ Chuckles ]

You'Re Still Gonna Be Here
At 5:00 With The Food, Right?

As I'Ve Told You Nine Times
Since Wednesday.

What Are You
Really Calling About?

Janelle Said George
Wasn'T Coming To The Party,

And When I Asked Her Why,
She Clammed Up On Me.

Do You Know Anything?

Well, I Would If She'D Returned
My Calls All Week.

I Know You, Mama.
That Still Isn'T Why
You'Re Calling.

Well [Laughs] How'S It Going
With You And Randall?

There'S Nothing Going
With Me And Randall.

He Didn'T Turn Out To Be
The Designer For Me.

That'S Why He Acted So Strange
When I Invited Him To The Party.

What?!

[ Telephone Beeps ]

Why Would You Do
Something Like That?

'Cause He'S My Friend,
And I Like Him.

And He'S Cultured...
Thinner.

...And He Kind Of Likes You,
Too.

Don'T Let
That Demiglace Burn.

If You Do,
That'S 16 Quarts Of Veal Stock

Coming Out
Of Your Paycheck.

I Got My Hands Full, Mom.
I'Ll See You At 5:00.

<I> Au Revoir,</I> Paris.

[ Telephone Beeps ]

Should I Just --
Should I Do It Myself?

It'S Crooked.

[ Chuckles ] Hey.

Hey.

Thought Your Mom Was
Dropping You Off At 7:00.

Oh, I Told Her

I Wanted To Go With You.

I Took The Bus
To Come To Your Place,

But The Landlord Said
You Moved.

You Don'T Have To Be Gentle,
Son.

I Got Evicted.

You Know,
I Came To See You Last Week.

You Didn'T Come
To The Door.

I'M Here Now.

It'S Lame,

Living With Mom And Todd
And The Baby.

Can I Live With You?

Believe Me, There'S Nothing
I Would Love More.

But It'S Just
Not That Simple.

Your Mom Has Custody,
And You'Re A Minor.

Don'T Worry.

I'Ll Work It Out Somehow,

Just As Soon
As I Get My Stuff Together.

[ Scoffs ]

Charlotte:
Not One Word About Our Split
To Mama Or Anybody Else.

Today,
We Are A Happy Family.

I Want To Be A Happy Family
Every Day.

[ Sighs ]
Do We Have A Deal Or Not, Al?

Sunday Dinners With You
And The Kids For A Month

Buys My Silence.

It'S A Win-Win Deal
As Far As I'M Concerned.

Just Get In The Car.
I'Ll Get In The Car.

[ Sighs ]

[ Cellphone Ringing ]

Shanice,
Stay In Your Room.

If You'Re Here For Your Stuff,
Come Back Tomorrow.

I'Ll Have It Boxed Up
In The Garage.

I Don'T Care
About My Stuff.

I Came Here
To Talk To You.

You Wouldn'T Answer
My Calls, So --

Anything You Have To Say,
Tell It To Your Lawyer.

I'M Talking To Him
Tomorrow.

I'M Seeing
A Therapist Tomorrow

To Figure Out
Why I Did This,

To Make Sure
That I Never Do It Again.

I-I'M Sick, Janelle,
But I Can Heal.

Look, I Love You,

And I Love The Life
That We'Ve Built Together.

And I-I Know
It'S Gonna Take Years

To Regain Your Trust,

But I'M Thinking About Us
And Shanice.

If I Lose My Job,
We Lose This House.

And Who'S Gonna Pay
For Shanice'S School?

Who'S Gonna
Buy The Groceries?

If You'Re Saying
I Have No Job

And I Have No Skills

And I Have
No Place To Go...

...You'Re Right, George.

I Don'T Have
A Lot Of Options.

In Fact, I Only Have One.

Ohh!

To Make Sure
They Bury You Under The Jail

For What You Did
To My Child!!

Crazy Bitch!

[ Sighs ]

If Shanice Was Gonna
Testify,

I'D Be In Jail Already.

But She Won'T Say A Word,

Because She Knows
That Once She Got Into Court,

They'D Make Her Admit

The Truth
That You Don'T Want To Face...

...It Takes Two.

<I> Here To Tell You</I>

<I> I'M Not Feeling All That Well</I>
<I> This Evening,</I>

<I> But I Look Spectacular.</I>

[ Inhaler Hisses ]

<I> And On The Day</I>
<I>That You'Re Telling Your Family</I>

<I> You'Re Dying,</I>

<I> Well, Hell,</I>
<I> That'S All That Matters.</I>

Are You Gonna
Talk To Your Mom?

She'S Been
Acting Crazy All Week.

I'Ll Try.

[ Singing In French ]

Brenda, I Will Talk To You
When I'M Ready.

Please Stop Calling Me.

Who'S This?

This Is Meagan.

Hi.
Hi.

Ugh.

Now, You Went A Little Heavy
On The Salt With The --

What Is This?

Anchoieade.

It'S Anchovy Puree.

It'S High Blood Pressure
On A Cracker.

If I Want To Hang Salt Licks
From The Ceiling, Charlotte,

It'S None
Of Your Damn Business.

[ Chuckles ]

Ooh!
Oh, What You Doing?

[ Laughing ]
Oh, I'M Sorry, Baby!

Come On, Man. Got An Extra Shirt
For You Upstairs.

I'M Sorry!
[ Laughs ]

Phew.

You Look Like Hell.

What Are You
Doing In Here?

What You Hiding From?

There'S
Too Many People.

Shanice, Your Breath
Does Not Smell Like Punch.

Granny, Don'T.

What Are You Doing
Drinking A Wine Cooler?

[ Sniffs ]

[ Laughing ]

Ooh.

What Are You Doing
Drinking A Wine Cooler?

Ask Your Daughter.

"Ask Your Daughter."

[ Laughs ]

Now, It'S Gonna Be
A Little Big,

But You Can Hang On To This
Until Our Next Visit, All Right?

Is That A Sports Injury?

No.

Is Something Going On
At Home?

Sometimes,
Todd Has A Bad Temper.

[ Sighs ]

Does Your Mother Know
About This?

What Is Going On At Your House,
Girl?

And Where Is George?

All You Need To Know
Is That I'M Handling It.

Handling What?

I Need
To Borrow Your Car, Mama.

I Got The Keys
Out Of Your Purse.

What Are You Doing
In My Purse?

I Need To Go Talk
To Donnetta'S Husband

About Putting His Hands
On My Son.

Is That True, Baby?

Do Not Do
Anything Stupid.

I'M Just Gonna Talk To Him,
Man To Man.

You Need To Run That Prick Over
With A Car.

You Need
To Mind Your Business.

Do Not Forget
You Have A Court Date Coming Up.

This Is My Son
We'Re Talking About.

That'S My Grandson.

And You Let
Cooler Heads Prevail. Hear?

I'Ll Take Your Advice
When You Stop Keeping Secrets.

Come On.

What Secrets?

Yeah, Well, You Tell Me Yours,
And I'Ll Tell You Mine.

Shanice.

What Are You Staring At,
"Wheels"?

Shanice,
You Apologize Right Now.

You Don'T Get To Tell Me
What To Do Ever Again.

[ Knock On Door ]

Hey, Lewis.
How You Doing, Buddy?

Talk To Me About Punching My Son
In His Chest.

Wait.
What Are You Talking About?

Go Ahead.
Take A Look.

I Bet You Didn'T Know
About Your Husband'S Approach

To Parenting, Did You?

Did Jimar Tell You What I Found
In His Schoolbag?

You Do Not Slug
A 13-Year-Old Boy

For Carrying
A Little Weed.

Oh, What, You Wait
Until It'S A Little Smack?

Did -- Did Jimar Tell You
That He Shoved Me First?

Yeah.
[ Chuckles ] Wow.
"He Hit Me First."

That'S Of You, Todd.Y Adult
Lewis. Lewis.

He Shoved You
Because You Told Him

He Was
A Worthless Piece Of Dirt.

I Will Not Tolerate
Any Kind Of Drug Use

Under My Roof.

And I Will Not
Tolerate You

And Striking My Son.
Lewis.

Well, That Sounds A Lot Like
A Threat To Me, Lewis.

Not Good For Your Probation,
Buddy.

Okay, Lewis,

Why Don'T You Take Jimar
Back To Your Mom'S?

We'Re Gonna
Talk About This In The Morning.

Okay, Todd, Um...

You And I Both Know
Jimar Is A Good Kid.

Now, I'M Not One To Disrespect
A Man In His Own Home,

But Jimar Is My Son.

So How About I Talk To Him
About The Drug Use

From My Own
Personal Experience

And You Keep Your Hands
In Your Pockets?

That Sounds
Reasonable.

On Monday,
I Want To Talk To You

About Some Kind
Of Joint-Custody Situation.

Okay, On Monday.

All Right?
Okay.

Jimar,
Why Don'T You Pack A Bag?

You'Re Gonna Stay
With Your Father
For The Weekend.

No. Donnetta,
Don'T Patronize Him.

How Is He Gonna Afford
To Feed Him?

Jimar, Just Go Pack.

No, Seriously,
Donnetta,

They Both Need
To Hear This.

If Jimar Disobeys Me,
If He Disrespects Me,

I Will Discipline Him
Any Way That I See Fit.

And Considering The Fact
That We Can Count On One Hand

The Number Of Times
That You'Ve Contributed

To The Well-Being Of Your Son
In The Past Four Years,

I Don'T Think
You Have A Say-So Here.

Now,
You Kindly Leave My House.

Okay.

No!

You Will Not Tell Me

How To Raise My Son!
No, No! Stop, Stop!

Get Off Of Me!

Just...

Go, Please!

Jimar Is Safe With Me,
I Swear To You.

[ Thunder Crashes ]

[ Wheezing ]

Come On, Mama.
You Can Do It.

[ Wheezes ]

[ Cheers And Applause ]

[ "Can-Can" Plays ]

Cecil.

Cecil.

Woman: Cake! Cake. Cake.

This Is Not The Place.
I'M Sorry, Cecil.

I Don'T Know
Why You'Re Angry At Me.

I Don'T Know
If You'Re Scared Or What.

But I Had To Come Here.

I Have Something
To Show You.

It'S A Girl.
[ Chuckles ]

Lucky For Hakeem,
He'S Got You.

It'S Gonna Be A Whole Lot
Of Women In One House.

That'S Not My Baby.

No Matter What They Say
About Me, I'Ve Changed.

Oh, You Changed Before
Or After Vegas?

I Never Lied About The Way
I Felt About You, Cecil.

I Just Wanted A Good Man
For My Kids.

I Was Going To Marry You.

Well, Where It Started
Isn'T Where It Is.

I Love You.

We Could Be A Family.

No. You Need To Go Home
To<I> Your</I> Family.

She Had To Be
Mighty Desperate

To Come Here On My Birthday,
Cecil.

[ Sighs ]

[ Sighs ]

Hey, Mama.

Look,
I Really, Really Need

To Talk To You
About Something.

I Really, Really Need

To Finish This Cake
In Peace.

Oh!

Paris, Paris,
You Can Barely Stand.

Let Me Take You Home.

I Don'T [Laughs]

I Don'T Need
Anything From You.

Okay?

Okay.

It'S A Shame They Spent
All That Money On Flowers

And They'Re Just Gonna
Die Tomorrow.

You Know What Your Problem Is,
Babes?

Is That You Don'T Appreciate
Beauty For Its Own Sake.

But I Do.

And That'S What I Call
Beautiful.

And What I Call
Beautiful Is

A Husband
Who Doesn'T Cheat On His Wife.

Babes, Man,
The Kids Are Up In The Playroom,

Having Their Own Party
With Their Cousins.

Why Don'T We
Just Leave Them There,

Go Home Tonight,
Talk This Thing Through?

Al, If You Even Think
About Coming Home,

I Will
Change The Locks.

You Will What?

I Hate You.

[ Door Opens ]

[ Breathing Heavily ]

Don'T Ask.

I Wasn'T Going To.

Join Me?

Yeah.

Ooh. Who Knew The Real Party
Was In Here?

Did I Just Hear You Say
You Locked Al Out Of The House?

And When Did You
Get Back?

Did Everything Go Okay
At Donnetta'S?

Everything Went Fine.

Paris: What?
What'S This About Locks?

Trouble In Paradise?

She Put Al Out --

The Only Good Man
Any One Of You Ever Married.

[ Laughs ]

What The Hell Is
So Damn Funny?

You Have Been
Torturing Me

With Your Happy Marriage
For Years,

And Now It'S Over?

[ Laughing ] Please Tell Me
He Did Something Good,

Like Burn Your House Down
Or Cheat On You.

<I> When Did Paris</I>
<I> Turn Into The Mean One?</I>

Oh, He Did.

He Cheated On You?!

This Is Awesome!

You Just Live
To Embarrass Me.

It'S Not Enough
That You'Re Mama'S Favorite,

But You Always Got To Throw
Your Damn Money In My Face.

You Flatter Yourself
If You Think I Give You

That Much Time
In My Day.

Oh, Please, Paris,
You'Re Not That Perfect.

Actually,
You'Re An Old Maid,

Except For The Drama
That You Got Going On

Between You
And That Little Gardener.

He'S A Landscape Designer,

Not That You Would Know
The Difference.

All Right.
That'S Enough Of All Of This.

You Know Why
You Talk Down To Me?!

Because You'Re Jealous!

You Always Have Been,
Right Back From The Time

Where You Tried
To Kill Me On The Stairs!

Oh, My God!
I'M Saying It Again.

You Know
She Tried To Kill Me!

Here Comes The Tale
Of Charlotte'S Harrowing Tumble.

Show Me
The Crack In Your Skull.

[ Laughs ]

You'Re Fine.

Well, No Thanks To You.

You Should Have Finished
The Damn Job.

Don'T Be An Idiot,
Charlotte.

No One Tried
To Kill You.

Yes, You Did.

You Deliberately Tried
To Kill Me On The Stairs.

Are You Losing Your Mind
In Front Of Everyone?

No,
I'M Not Losing My Mind.

I'M Crazy For Not Whupping
Your Ass Decades Ago!

[ Both Shouting ]

Cecil:
No, You Two Settle Down!

Settle Down!

Al: Knock It Off.

Stop! Stop! Stop!

Okay,
You Have To Calm Down.

You Can'T Act Like This.

Why Not?

Charlotte Always Acts Like
She'S 10 Years Old.

Please.
Why Can'T I?!

Because You'Re Gonna Be
A Grandmother.

[ Crowd Gasps ]
Meagan'S Pregnant.

I'Ve Been Trying
To Tell You All Night.

Lord.

Well, So Much
For Your Perfect Son.

Not Now, Charlotte.
Please, Al.

I'M Not Gonna
Let You Ruin Your Life.

You Have To Take Care
Of This.

"Take Care Of This"?

You Were Younger Than Me
When You Got Pregnant.

You Wish You Would Have
Taken Care Of Me?

We'Re Getting Married.

[ Laughs ]

I Need Some Aspirin.

No, No.
[ Crowd Gasps ]

Paris, Let Me Help You.
No, Get Away!

Let Me Help You.

No, I Just...
[ Glass Clinks ]

I Have
An Announcement, Too.

Scome On, Honey.,
No!

I Can Drink What I Want.

I'M Grown Up. A Woman.

Get Down.
You Hear That?!

I'M A Woman,

And My Mother'S Husband, George,
Knows It.

George Is Good To Me.
He Buys Me Whatever I Want.

George Is So Good To Me
That He Sneaks Into My Bedroom

And Screws Me
Whenever He Wants To!

Get Down!
No!

[ Crying ]
And If You Had Been Good

And Done
What You Were Supposed To

With Your Husband,

I-I Wouldn'T Have
Had To!

Cheers.

Where The Hell Is
George Now?

I Don'T Know, Daddy.
He Moved Out.

Excuse Me.

Is Lewis Price Here?

Woman: Oh, God.

Yeah. That'S Me.

I Have To Take You In,
Lewis,

On Suspicion
Of Assault And Battery.

Officer,
Can We Please Do This Outside?

[ Police Radio Chatter ]

I'M Sorry, Mama...Daddy.

[ Sobbing ]
Come On, Baby.

Come On, Baby.

I Think...

This Party Is Over.

I Love You All For Coming,

And I Thank You,
But It'S Time To Go.

Everybody,
Please, Just Go.

Thank You.

Come On, Let'S Go.

[ Crowd Murmuring ]

Viola: Charlotte,

I Want You To Go

With Shanice
And Your Sister.

See What You Can Do
To Help.

I'M Going, Too.

You'Re Not Going Anywhere
Except Home.

No,
I Have To Go Find George

And Put A Bullet
In His Head.

Take A Number.

I'Ll Take Care Of George.

Viola: No, You Won'T.

Promise Me [Wheezes]

That You Will Leave This
To The Police.

I Promise You That I'Ll Try
To Restrain Myself.

And, Grandma,
I'M Gonna Stay With You.

No. Go With Meagan.

You Show Her That Not All
The Prices Are Crazy.

I Love You.

I Love You, Too.

[ Wheezing ]

What Has Happened Here?

Our Grandkids -- Two Of Them --
Being Messed With?

You Just Get Some Rest.

I'M Gonna Handle It.

Get Everybody Back Here
Tomorrow.

There'S Something I Need
To Tell Them,

Something They Need --

Vy, You Don'T Always Have

The Gospel
On What The Kids Need.

I'M Their Father.

I Know
What They Need Right Now --

Time.

Give It To Them.

I'M Gonna
Go Check On Lewis.

<I> He'S Right,</I>

<I> But Time Is</I>
<I> The One Thing I-I Don'T Have.</I>

<I> If This Is It, Lord,</I>

<I> Remember, I Just Want My Kids</I>
<I> To Be Happy.</I>

<I>I Want Them To Find Their Place</I>
<I> In The World.</I>

Â™ª My Home Is Over Jordan Â™ª

Â™ª Deep River Â™ª

Â™ª Lord, I Want To Cross Over Â™ª

Â™ª Into Campground Â™ª

Thank You
For Everything.

[ Door Opens, Closes ]

Anything I Can Do?

Hide That Last Piece
Of Sock-It-To-Me Cake

From Lewis' Lawyer.

I Didn'T Even Get A Chance
To Smell It

Before He
Sucked It All Down.

[ Kettle Slams ]

You Know What, Charlotte?

If You'Re Going To Be
Hateful And Ugly

On The Day
That I Buried My Mother,

Why Don'T You Just Leave?

Don'T You Two Get Started,
Please.

There'S No One
Holding You Back.

Do What You Want To Do.

Both Of You Should Be
Ashamed.

[ Music Box Plays ]

Charlotte, Wait.

There'S Nothing
For Me Here.

Yes, There Is.

Get Your Ass
Back In This House Now.

Paris, You Sit There,
Janelle, Here.

This Better Go Fast.

My Lawyer'S Breathing Fire
Out There.

Cecil: It Will Go
As Fast As It Goes.

Do I Have To Be
Here?

Yes. Here'S A Letter
With Your Name On It.

Open It.

Granny Made A Mistake.
It'S For You.

It Says,
"Dear Janelle."

[ Chuckles ]

Granny Was Bossy
To The End.

It Says In Mine

That She Wants Us
To Read To Each Other --

Paris To Charlotte,
Janelle To Shanice,

And Me And Lewis.

Paris, You Start.

Mama Was Out Of Her Mind.
This Is Crazy.

And We'Re Doing It,
Just Like She Wants Us To.

[ Sighs ]

"Dear Charlotte,

"I Hope You Aren'T
Still Mad At Me,

"'Cause I'M Not Mad At You.

[ Voice Breaking ]
"You'Re My S-Sweet Girl.

"Sometimes, It'S Hard To Tell
When One Child Might Need

"A Little More Attention
And Affection

"Than The Other Ones.

"If I Could Go Back,
I Would Hug You More,

"Kiss You More,

"Let You Sit On My Lap
As Long As You Wanted To

"Instead Of Getting Up
To Check The Damn Laundry.

"I'M Sorry
If I Didn'T Make You Feel Like

"You Were Something Special,
'Cause You Were.

"But Do Me A Favor.

"Don'T Take It Out On Al.

"He'S A Good Man
For Standing By The Son He Made

"With A Woman
He Doesn'T Care About --

"All The More Reason
To Love Him And Forgive Him.

And Most Of All,
Don'T Take It Out..."

[ Sobs ]

"Don'T Take It Out On Paris."
[ Sighs ]

"That Famous Time She Shoved You
Down The Stairs --

"That Was My Fault --

"Coming Down
With Too Much Laundry

"Right Behind Her.

"You Gonna Come
Kick Me In My Grave?

"And Who Do You Think It Was

"Who Sat In The Doctor'S Office
And Cried

"Like She Was The One Getting
Stitches In Her Head?

[ Crying ] "Paris Loved You
From The Second She Saw Light,

And If She Doesn'T
Show That Now..."

"...It'S Just
Her Own Problems Talking.

"I Love You, Sweet One,

"And Don'T You Ever
Forget It.

Your Mama, Always."

"Dear Paris, I'M Sorry
For Making You Feel Like

"You Had To Be The Best
At Everything

"And Take Care Of Everyone

"Just 'Cause You Were Born
So Reliable And Mature.

"It'S Time To Stop Trying To Be
Superwoman."

"Do Something Half-Assed.

For Once In Your Life..."

[ Chuckles ]

"...Let The Crap Stick
To The Pan And Burn."

[ Laughs ]

"And Let Yourself Be
Taken Care Of.

"You'Ve Done Worse
Than Randall -- A Lot Worse.

Focus On Him
Instead Of Dingus."

<I> I Don'T Know</I>

<I>If All This Hugging And Kissing</I>
<I> You'Re Looking At Is</I>

<I> What Will Be</I>
<I> Or What I Hope Will Be,</I>

<I> But Either Way,</I>
<I> It'S A Beautiful Thing.</I>

"Trust How You Raised
That Boy.

"He'S Already A Good Man.

"Stanford Can Wait.

"The Only Thing
That<I> Can'T</I> Wait Is

"The Life You Are Living
Right This Second.

You Will Always Have My Love.

Cecil:
Shanice, You'Re Next.

"Dear Janelle,
I Know Why You Put

"All Those Crazy Decorations
On Your Lawn --

"Giant Easter Bunnies,
Groundhogs,

"An Inflatable Secretary Sitting
At A Real Typewriter.

"You'Re Hiding From The World
That Killed Your Jimmy

"And Trying To Keep Shanice Safe
Behind A Wall Of 'Happy.'

"You Didn'T Know The Danger Was
Inside Your House.

"You Need
To Forgive Yourself First,

"And Shanice Will Follow.

"I Love You, My Sweetest,

"A Monster Is A Monster,

"And Your Mother'S Gonna
Get Him.

"One Day,
You'Ll Have Kids Of Your Own,

"And You Will Realize
How Hard You Can Love Someone

"And How Much It Can Hurt

"And How Much It'S Worth
To See Them Grow

"And Find Their Place
In The World.

"Let Your Mama
Take Care Of You Now.

The Both Of You Have
My Love Forever."

It'S Your Turn, Daddy.

[ Groans ]

"Dear Lewis,

For All The Problems
You Gave Me --"

"I Wish I Could Have Had
Two More Of You,

"'Cause You Have
A Heart Of Gold.

"I Failed You As A Mother.

"I Was Expecting You
To Turn Into What My Idea

"Of What A Man Should Be.

"And For That, I'M Sorry.

"But That'S No Excuse

"For You Trying
To Drink Your Way To Happiness.
