[ Man Narrating ]
WHEN MICHAEL MYERS
WAS SIX YEARS OLD,

HE STABBED HIS SISTER
TO DEATH.

FOR YEARS HE WAS LOCKED UP
IN SMITH'S GROVE SANITARIUM,

BUT HE ESCAPED.

AND SUDDENLY, HALLOWEEN
BECAME ANOTHER WORD FOR MAYHEM.

ONE BY ONE, HE KILLED
HIS ENTIRE FAMILY...

UNTIL HIS NINE-YEAR-OLD NIECE,
JAMIE LLOYD,

WAS THE ONLY ONE LEFT ALIVE.

SIX YEARS AGO, HALLOWEEN NIGHT,
MICHAEL AND JAMIE VANISHED.

MANY PEOPLE BELIEVED THEM DEAD,
BUT I THINK THAT SOMEONE
HID THEM AWAY.

SOMEONE WHO KEEPS MICHAEL,
PROTECTS HIM,

TRIES TO CONTROL HIM.

AND IF THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW,
YOU CAN'T CONTROL EVIL.

YOU CAN LOCK IT UP,
YOU CAN BURN IT AND BURY IT
AND PRAY THAT IT DIES,

BUT IT NEVER WILL.

IT JUST RESTS AWHILE.

YOU CAN LOCK YOUR DOORS
AND SAY YOUR PRAYERS AT NIGHT,

BUT THE EVIL'S OUT THERE,
WAITING.

AND MAYBE, JUST MAYBE,

IT'S CLOSER THAN YOU THINK.

[ Door Slams ]
JAMIE !

[ Crying ]
COME WITH ME IF YOU
WANT TO SAVE YOUR BABY.

[ Door Slams ]
[ Whimpers ]
GOD, HE'S COMING.

IT'SBACK TALKWITH BARRY SIMMS.

WE'RE IN THE SECOND HOUR OF
A SPECIAL HALLOWEEN EDITION OF
BACK TALK,AND I'M BARRY SIMMS.

TOMORROW NIGHT, WE WILL BE
COMING TO YOU FROM HADDONFIELD,

THE TOWN THAT HAS BANNED
HALLOWEEN SINCE 1989...

WHEN INFAMOUS
SERIAL KILLER MICHAEL MYERS
AND HIS NIECE, JAMIE LLOYD,

AND ABOUT A DOZEN COPS
WERE KILLED IN AN EXPLOSION.

WE HAVE A CALLER WAITING.
WHO'S NEXT TO TALK TO ME ?

[ Female Caller ]
UH, I KNOW THIS
MAY SOUND CRAZY, BARRY,

BUT I REALLY THINK
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM.

HE'S SO UNTAMED,
SO UNINHIBITED.

HE'S EVERYTHING
I'VE EVER WANTED IN A MAN.
[ Barry ]  MM-HMM.

[ Barry ]
YOU KNOW, THIS IS GOOD.
I CAN SEE THE TABLOIDS NOW.

"PSYCHO LAYS NYMPHO: THE BEST
 SEX HE EVER DISMEMBERS."

IS THIS THE TYPE
YOU ALWAYS FALL FOR, LADY ?

ANY OTHER
SERIAL STUDS ON THE LIST ?
YOU KNOW, BUNDY ?  MANSON ?

WHAT ABOUT THAT DAHMER GUY ?
I BET YOU COULD REALLY COOK
WITH HIM.

[ Female Caller ]
NO, I JUST WANT MICHAEL.

I WANNA KNOW
WHAT'S BEHIND THAT MASK.

[ Thunder Rumbling ]

[ Thunderclap ]

[ Barry ]  NOW, WE'VE GOT
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY CLAIMS
TO HAVE SEEN THAT MICHAEL MYERS.

COME ON.
YOU'RE ONBACK TALKNEXT.

I WAS ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLD

I SURVIVED.

[ Barry ]
THERE IS HELP OUT THERE
FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

IT'S CALLED ELECTRO-SHOCK
THERAPY !  COME ON.

YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
THAT MICHAEL MYERS
IS ACTUALLY ALIVE.

MICHAEL'S WORK ISN'T DONE
IN HADDONFIELD.

AND SOON, VERY SOON,

HE'LL COME HOME
TO KILL AGAIN.
[ Thunderclap ]

BUT THIS TIME
I'LL BE READY.

[ Male Caller ]
MICHAEL MYERS WAS NOT KILLED
IN THAT EXPLOSION...

AT THE HADDONFIELD
POLICE STATION.

THE CIA ABDUCTED MYERS FROM
HIS CELL AND KILLED EVERYONE
TO COVER UP THEIR TRACKS.

[ Typewriter Keys Tapping ]
[ Barry ]
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT ?

[ Caller ]
THAT'S OBVIOUS.  THEY WANTED
THE ULTIMATE ASSASSIN.

[ Barry ]
MYERS IS NOW
ON THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL.

[ Caller ]
NO ONE CONTROLS MYERS,
NOT EVEN THE CIA.

HE TOOK OUT EIGHT AGENTS
WHILE THEY HAD HIM AT LANGLEY.

THEY COULDN'T CONTROL HIM, SO
THEY PACKED HIM UP IN A ROCKET
AND SHIPPED HIM OFF TO SPACE.

THANK YOU.  THANK YOU !
[ Male Caller ]  YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THE FACTS, MAN !

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT'S THE SITUATION,
IS THAT THE CI--

[ Barry Imitating

THAT'S WHAT TOMORROW NIGHT
IS ALL ABOUT.  THIS TOWN
IS DYING, BARRY.

[ Barry ]  I'VE HEARD MICHAEL
MYERS BLAMED FOR A LOT OF THINGS
TONIGHT, BUT THIS IS A FIRST.

HE'S ACTUALLY KILLED

[ Coughing ]

THAT ORIGINATED
ABOUT 500 B.C.

THEY WERE SYMBOLS
CARVED OUT OF STONE...

OR PIECES OF WOOD,

USED IN PAGAN RITUALS
TO PORTEND FUTURE EVENTS
AND INVOKE MAGIC.

AMONG THE ANCIENT DRUIDS,
THORN REPRESENTED A DEMON...

THAT SPREAD SICKNESS,
BROUGHT DEATH TO HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

ACCORDING TO CELTIC LEGEND,
ONE CHILD FROM EACH TRIBE...

WAS CHOSEN TO BE INFLICTED
WITH THE CURSE OF THORN...

TO OFFER THE BLOOD SACRIFICES
OF ITS NEXT OF KIN...

ON THE NIGHT OF SAMHAIN.
HALLOWEEN.

THE SACRIFICE OF ONE FAMILY
MEANT SPARING THE LIVES
OF AN ENTIRE TRIBE.

FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN CONVINCED
THERE MUST BE SOME REASON,

SOME METHOD
BEHIND MICHAEL'S MADNESS.

THE DRUIDS WERE ALSO
GREAT MATHEMATICIANS
AND ASTRONOMERS,

BUT THE THORN SYMBOL IS ACTUALLY
A CONSTELLATION OF STARS...

THAT APPEARS FROM TIME TO TIME
ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT.

WHENEVER IT APPEARS,
HE APPEARS.

[ Tommy Tapping Keyboard ]
COINCIDENCE ?

[ Cries ]
I THINK THAT'S WHY
THESE PEOPLE,

WHOEVER THEY ARE,
ARE AFTER JAMIE'S BABY.

[ Crying ]
TO MAKE IT MICHAEL'S
FINAL SACRIFICE.

[ Cries Softly ]

WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?

TO FIND THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN
STOP HIM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
OH, NO.  WHERE'S DANNY ?

DANNY ?  DANNY !
MRS. BLANKENSHIP !

OH !
HAVE YOU SEEN--

DANNY, DON'T EVER WALK OFF
WITHOUT TELLING ME
WHERE YOU'RE GOING !

TAKE HIM UPSTAIRS.
LOCK THE DOOR AND WAIT
'TIL I GET BACK.

AND, KARA,
WHATEVER YOU DO,

DON'T GO BACK
TO YOUR HOUSE.

DURING THE AUTOPSY
WE FOUND THIS.
IT'S PLACENTAL FLUID.

YOU MEAN TO SAY TH--
I ESTIMATE SHE GAVE BIRTH
  NO MORE THAN 24 HOURS AGO.

THEN THE QUESTION IS,
WHERE IS THE BABY ?

I THINK I--
 I MAY ALREADY KNOW.

[ Siren Wailing In Distance ]

[ Crickets Chirping ]

DO YOU KNOW WHY
WE CELEBRATE HALLOWEEN ?

BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN
WE GO TRICK-OR-TREATING
AND GET CANDY.

OH, WELL, YES, BUT...
A LONG, LONG TIME AGO...

IT WAS A NIGHT
OF GREAT POWER...

WHEN THE DAYS GREW SHORT...

AND THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD
RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES...

TO WARM THEMSELVES
BY THE FIRESIDE.

ALL ACROSS THE LAND,
HUGE BONFIRES WERE LIT.

OH, THERE WAS
A MARVELOUS CELEBRATION.

PEOPLE DANCED
AND THEY PLAYED GAMES...

AND THEY DRESSED UP
IN COSTUMES,

HOPING TO WARD OFF
THE EVIL SPIRITS,

ESPECIALLY...

THE BOGEYMAN.
[ Thunderclap ]

WHAT'S THE BOGEYMAN ?

COME ON, DANNY.  SAY GOOD NIGHT
TO MRS. BLANKENSHIP.
GOOD NIGHT, MRS. BLANKENSHIP.

HE HEARS THE VOICE, YOU KNOW.
JUST LIKE THE OTHER BOY
THAT LIVED IN THAT HOUSE.

[ Thunderclap ]

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?
I WAS BABY-SITTING
WITH HIM THAT NIGHT--

LITTLE MIKEY MYERS THAT
LIVED ACROSS THE STREET--

AND THAT'S WHEN
THE VOICE CAME, THE NIGHT
HE MURDERED HIS SISTER.

MICHAEL HEARD A VOICE ?

IT TOLD HIM
TO KILL HIS FAMILY.

[ Thunderclap ]

[ Students Shouting,
  Chattering ]

WHERE THE HELL'S BARRY ?
LET'S GO !
DON'T GET STAR-STRUCK ON ME NOW.

WE GOT A REAL AGENDA HERE,
AND BARRY IS GONNA HELP US
GET THE MESSAGE OUT.

[ Beth ]
HEY, LOOK.

HELLOOOO, HADDONFIELD !

[ Crowd Cheering, Hooting ]

BARRY !
[ Announcer ]

DEBRA !  I'M HOME !

THANKS FOR THE DINNER.

WE--  COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

GODDAMMIT.
SHE ACTUALLY LEFT.

[ Chuckles ]

THE BOGEYMAN.

TO FINALLY PULL HALLOWEEN...

OUT OF THE PROVERBIAL
HADDONFIELD CLOSET ?

WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS
WE WILL NO LONGER...

LET THE POWERS THAT BE
CONTROL OUR MINDS.

FOR YEARS, HALLOWEEN
HAS REPRESENTED EVERYTHING
THAT'S WRONG WITH HADDONFIELD.

BUT MICHAEL MYERS
IS LONG GONE.

THERE IS NO BOGEYMAN !

WHOA !

DOES SHE GET THIS RILED UP
IN THE SACK, TIM ?

I BET SHE WEARS CROTCHLESS
PANTIES AND BARKS LIKE A DOG.

BETH, WHAT DO YOU SAY, HONEY ?
YOU AND ME, UH--

[ Beth Scoffs ]

AS I WAS SAYING, WE HAVE
TO STOP ACTING OUT OF FEAR.

JUST LOOK AT TIM'S FAMILY.
THEY LIVE IN THE MYERS HOUSE.

YOU DO ?
WE DO ?

UH... YEAH, WE DO.
GREAT HOUSE.

HMM.  I SEE.
STRONG WOOD.

YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
 YOU ACTUALLY LIVE...

IN THE HOUSE
OF THE MOST BRUTAL
MASS MURDERER IN HISTORY ?

THIS IS
THE BARRY SIMMS SHOW.

AND WHEN WE RETURN,
WE'LL BE COMIN' AT YOU LIVE...

FROM THE ONE,
THE ONLY MYERS HOUSE.

HOW'S THAT FOR A HALLOWEEN
SHOCK-FEST ?  WOO-AHH !

HOW FAR TO YOUR HOUSE ?
HALF A MILE.  BUT I
  DON'T KNOW IF MY FOLKS--

GOOD.  I'LL MEET YOU THERE
IN FIVE.

WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS ?
  WE'RE SUPPOSED TO THROW CANDY.
PHONE !

RELAX YOUR CRACK, SWEETHEART.
QUICK TOOTLE AROUND THE OLD
HOUSEHOLD AND WE'LL BE BACK.

PULL THE VAN OUT BACK SO THAT
I CAN SNEAK OUT OF HERE
NICE AND QUIETLY.

OH, NO.  NO, NO, REALLY.
YOU'RE TOO GOOD TO ME.

THANKS FOR PUTTING ME IN
THE MIDDLE OF THIS CHEAP-SHIT
COUNTRY BUMPKIN OUTFIT, PAUL.

I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
MY FANS EXPECT BETTER THAN THIS.

YOU TELL THAT PENNY-PINCHING
WHINER MIKE SARDUCCI...

THAT WHEN I GET BACK,
I'M GONNA CUT OFF HIS BALLS...

AND WEAR 'EM AS EARRINGS.

WHERE'S THE GODDAMN VAN ?
GOD !

OH, NO, I'M TROTTIN' OUT
FOR A CHEESEBURGER.

I'M TAKING THE SHOW
TO THE REAL MYERS HOUSE...

WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE GONE
IN THE FIRST PLACE !

TEN MINUTES IN THAT HOUSE
AND I'LL HAVE EVERY FRUITCAKE
MEDIUM IN THE COUNTRY...

CALLING IN TRYING TO CHANNEL
THE SPIRIT OF THAT PUSSY,
MICHAEL MYERS.

[ Chuckling ]
SURE WE CAN DO
ANOTHER SHOW ABOUT HIM.

KICK THE AUDIENCE
IN THE FACE ENOUGH,
AND THEY'LL LICK YOU ALL OVER.

I'LL CALL YA LATER.
BYE-BYE.

TO THE LIGHTS ?

SORRY HE TURNED OUT
TO BE SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

IT'S OKAY.

WHERE IS EVERYONE ?
MOM ?  KARA ?

THEY'RE PROBABLY AT THE FAIR,
WHICH IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE.

BETH, UM, WHAT YOU SAID
BEFORE ABOUT MICHAEL MYERS
LIVING IN OUR HOUSE ?

IS THAT
REALLY TRUE ?

IT WAS A COLD HALLOWEEN NIGHT.

HE STOOD IN THE SHADOWS
WATCHING THROUGH THE WINDOWS...

AS HIS SISTER
AND HER BOYFRIEND
MADE LOVE.

THEN HE CREPT INSIDE,
PICKED UP A BUTCHER KNIFE,

SHE TURNED AROUND...
AND HE STABBED HER !

CUT IT OUT, BETH !
[ Thunderclap ]

I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW
THAT MICHAEL MYERS LIVED
IN MY HOUSE, OKAY ?

IT FREAKS ME OUT.

I'M SORRY.

I WAS JUST
FOOLIN' AROUND.

IT'S OKAY.

LET'S GET THE CANDLES.
