[breathing shakily]

[toilet flushes]

[footsteps creaking]

[inhales sharply]


[birds chirping]

[dog barking]

[man coughing]


You all right? Come on.
[grunting]


Here, drink.

Thank you, David.

Have some more.
I'm good. [clears throat]

I got it. It's good.
Okay.


You okay?

No. I'm old, and I didn't
sign up for this crap.

Are you trying
to get in shape?

What?

You out running?

Oh, yeah,
just went for a jog.

How far?

I don't know.
I wasn't keeping track.

Oh, come on, man.
I need stats.

I wasn't keeping a tab
or anything, Dad.

Just trying to get the blood flowing.
[coughing]


Find my lung over there?

You sure you're okay?

Yeah, this just
comes and goes.

All right. I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?

All right.

You working?
Yeah.

I'm gonna go
by Mrs. Staples.

Then I'm gonna run
to Fillmore.


to run a quick errand.


Yeah, Dad. This early.
Stop digging.

wherever it is you're going?


if you'll pick one up for me.

Candy bars cost a dollar, Dad.


You know what?
No, I don't know what.

You make dinner tonight,
we'll call it even. How's that sound?

like a good deal.

Hey, David?
Yeah.

my candy bar,

could you get some steaks
for dinner?

[switch clicks]
Uh, so I'm getting...

the dinner and the candy bar?

Almost my favorite.

Love you, Dad.
[chuckles] See ya.

[engine starts]

[engine turns off]

[train horn blows]

[bell chimes]

[door closes]

[vehicle starts]

[vehicle drives away]
[keys jingling]

[engine starts]

[door bell chimes]

Hey, Dawnell.

[door closes]


Good morning.

Would you hit me?

Thanks, brother.

Can I get a splash of that,
too, when you're done?

I'd really... I'd appreciate it, man.
Just, hands are full.

That's good.
Hey, thanks again, man.

Hey, David.

How you doing, Jeremy?

[no audible dialogue]

[engine starts]

[horn honking]

[tires screeching]

[grunts softly]

[phone beeping]

[no audible dialogue]

[phone vibrating]

[tires crunching on gravel]

[engine idling]

Sorry, boys.

[bicycle bell rings]
[boy] Dad!


Missed you, man.
Where were you?

I'm sorry.
I had some work stuff.

Hey, Dad.
Hey.

Did you get doughnuts?

Oh, I forgot.

Where's Jess?
She took off with some friends.

you forgot your homework. Hey, David.

Sorry I'm late.
No, no worries.

That's okay.
Everything okay?

Yeah, just work stuff.
Okay.

All right, boys,
don't be late.

and Principal Andrews

is gonna make me meet him
and make a plan.

You got some...
There you go. I love you.

Hey, you guys go ahead.
I'm gonna talk to Mom for a minute, okay?

Okay.
All right.

What's up?
Oh, nothing.

Just want to make sure we're
still good for Friday night.

Yeah. Still work for you
or you got something?

No, it's good. It's good.
I'm looking forward to it.

Yeah, me too.

The boys said
Jess took off. She okay?

Just dealing with it all.

I think this stuff
is harder on girls.

You think we're doing the right thing, Niki?
David, I don't know.

Look, the boys are
halfway to school.

You with them is the most
important thing right now.

Right, right, I'm sorry. It's just...
Don't be sorry.

We're doing what we discussed and
thought was best, and we said we'd see.

So we're seeing.


David, I love you,
you love me.

We're trying
to figure this out.

We can't analyze
every step,

and if the boys walk themselves to
school, that's on you.

Hey, Alex.
Yeah?

What do you call a pile of kittens?
What?

A meow-tain.

Aw, Dad!
Meow-tain.

Dad.
Come on.

That is terrible.
I want new jokes.

New jokes?
You guys tell me a joke.

A dog's always
in the push-up position.

Mitch Hedberg.
Search him up.

Mitch Hedberg?
Who's that?

A comedian
that's actually good.

Oh, the bus is here.

Bye, Dad.

Bye, boys.

[excited laughter]

What the hell?


Jess!

Jess!
[door opens]

What are you doing?

[door closes]

Where are you going? Hey!

What are you doing?

Just didn't wanna
go to school.

Your jacket's about to fall
out of your backpack.

Hey, David.

Hey, Jeremy.
Teenager stuff.

Yeah, thought
I'd kill mine sometimes.

Hey, well, if you don't see this
one the next couple of days,

it'll be our secret.

I got a spot in the back
if you need it.

That's a little weird, Jeremy.
Thank you, though.

What are you doing?

[Jess] Just let go. I'm not five.
[David] You're not five?

[engine idling]


I know it's not easy.

Mom's cheating on you.

[engine turns off]

No, she's not.
Yeah, she is.

I saw the guy
leaving this morning.

Jess, we agreed that we could see
other people during this time.

Oh, so you're just seeing other people too?
It doesn't matter.

It's none of your business
what we're doing.

It wasn't supposed to be
any of your business.

None of my business?
This is my family too.

But, Jess, you're the kid.
We're the parents.

We've gotta have time
to figure this out.

That's stupid.
It's not stupid.

Look, there's nothing I can say to you that's
not gonna make me out to be a loser dad.

Don't say that.
You're right, okay?

But I'm not gonna make your mom out
to be the villain in this thing.

She's not a bad person.

Look...

Jess, we got married
right out of high school,

we had you, then the boys.

We never knew
that we were gonna...

question things
when we got older.

That's bullshit.
It is not bull...

You know, I wish somebody
would've told me

that it's never gonna stop.

It's never gonna
get easy, okay?

You're not gonna just be an
adult and all of a sudden,

you don't question anything
that happens in life.

We're trying, Jess,
but there's no dadgum road map. Okay?

Why can't you guys
just be together?

Like Grandma and Grandpa!
They've been together for years.

We're trying, Jess.

I promise.

Well, figure your shit out,
because it's ruining my life.

You forgot your backpack.

If you want, we can just
pretend none of that happened.

You know, you can do it
all over again if you want.

Forget the buildup
and the drama.

You know, Dad...

you need to fight.

You need to fight for us.


Hi, Mrs. Allen.

[engine starts]

Morning, Mrs. Staples.
Morning.

How are you?

Well, I can't complain.

Had the grandkids over to
the house for the weekend.

That was fun.
But it's fun to send them home too.


[chuckles] How's your dad?
He's good.

Just farting around, you know.
Trying to stay busy.

[Mrs. Staples] I keep telling
him, we're both lonely widows.

Why not jump in a fox hole
together and fool around? [laughs]

What does he... Really, you told my dad...
He doesn't mention me?

It's not that he doesn't mention you...
Ah! I'll leave it there.

Let's get down to business.
You mind driving?

No, no, ma'am.
Come on.

[Mrs. Staples] Gonna head down
that road about a mile.

All right, thank you.
Yes, ma'am.

All right.

This is it
in all its glory.

Now I need for you to get
rid of it any way you like.

You can sell anything you think has
value, pocket the money, no problem.

What do you think?

I don't know, maybe two
weeks, we can have, say...

Hundred dollars a day
seem fair to you?

Sounds about all right.

Okay.

All right, come on.
I'll take you back up to the house.

Oh, no need. I need to exercise.
I'll walk back.

You sure?

No, but I figure
I'll risk it.

You need anything,
you let me know.

Mrs. Staples?

Hmm?

Did you and Tom
have a good marriage?


Well, not particularly.

Why?

Ah, just curious
if you were happy.


Tom was a good man.
I'm a decent woman.

I loved him.
He loved me.

But a real marriage,
it takes respect over love.

David, love is a feeling,
and feelings,

they move in,
they move out.

You and Niki
will work it out.

Now you get to work.

I'm gonna walk
on the left side.

You look as you leave,

in case I'm face down, dead in the gutter.
[chuckles]

Yes, ma'am.


[TV playing]
[knocking on door]



[door opens]
[Bug] Ah!

[David laughs]
[Niki] Daddy's here.

Please finish the sandwiches
and put those away?

[Jess] Home by 9:00, got it?
Got it.

What's up, boys?
All right, David, let's go.

Hey.

You ready?
[Niki] Yeah.

All right, y'all be good
for your sister, okay?

Okay, Dad.
Yeah, sure.

Boys, listen to your sister.
Give me a kiss.


Hey, Jess.
Kiss?

Let's go.

Y'all be good.
Bye, Dad.

I'm sorry about that.

I talked with Jess. She knew.
She just wanted to make a fight.

Well, it's hard.
It's got to be harder on her,

being older, more aware,
you know?

Yeah. Plus she's a teenager.
Girls that age...

got their own drama going on.

What's going on?

Oh, just, you know, one day, best friends
with someone, next day she wants to end them.

Typical teenage girls.

Oh, right.

You're going proper now?

Unless it's demeaning, then you can open
your own door. I certainly don't wanna...

I'll take the gesture.

Thank you.

[phone vibrates]

All right. Here we go.

Hey.

You mind if we stay close?

I had all night
planned for tonight.

Jess just hasn't been great,

and I'm nervous
with her watching the boys.

The boys can take care of themselves.
She has to be there just in case.

I know, but it's just
gonna stress me out.

Plus she has that show later
with her friends.

We agreed we were gonna make
date night a priority.

It is, but we also
still have to be parents.

You're right.


I'm sorry.

No, you're right.

Life's still happening,
right?


You mind if we just
drive around the block

and then come back here,
just so they think we've left?


[engine starts]

Thank you.




You warm enough?

Yeah. Thank you.

How are things?

Good. Spent the week
at Mrs. Staples'.

Nice.

How's your dad?

He's good.

He's funny.

I, uh...
It's like the time

between now and high school
never happened.

Yeah?
Yeah, you know,

it's like my chores have
just been waiting on me.

So now that
I've moved back home,

I'm expected to
take out the trash,

cut the grass, dishes,
like, whatever.

So, my first night back,

and I can't remember
when trash night was.

So, I wake up the next morning.
It's not done.

And Dad gives me
the exact same lecture

I used to get
in high school.


Yeah. Uh, verbatim.

Except the only
difference is,

Mom always used to
give it to me,

but now it's Dad,
and, I mean,

word for word, the exact same.
[laughs]

I'll pull up back here so they can't see us.
Yeah, perfect.

Yeah. It's all good.

[engine turns off]


You think you'll get
your own place?

I hope not, Niki.

I mean, what are we doing?

Am I delusional about this whole thing?
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

I...

Um, David...

I just meant that we could
figure it out if we needed,

getting you your own place if it's
hard living with your dad, that's all.

No, it's Dad, you know?

I think he likes
having me there.

Not walking around the house
talking to himself. I mean, he's...

still yelling at the TV,
you know, but...

it's a little less weird
if I'm there.


So, how's work?

Good.

Some good cases.

Judy's letting me do
more work on the cases.

She says I should
consider law school...

though she doesn't
want to lose me.

You thinking about it?

Kinda.

I don't know. It's only been three
months, so we'll see.

I don't know if it's something I'll get
bored of once it isn't exciting anymore.

No way you'll get bored,
smart as you are.

Heck, I wish I could have
had the babies, you know.

Just been
a stay-at-home dad.

You could have gone and you'd
have made partner by now.

We wouldn't be stressed
about money all the time.

We've always had what we needed, David.
You've always provided.

So what did you have planned
before Jess ruined it?

Oh, save it for another time.

Come on.
No.

I'll imagine it now
and we can do it another time.

I... [sighs]

Tell me a little, at least.


started writing again,
you know.

Punk songs?

No, not punk songs again.
I can't yell like that anymore.

Just, like, singer-songwriter stuff.
You know, no big deal.


Gonna go back on the road?

Yup. [sighs] Thought
about giving it all up.

Loading up the boys,
starting a band.


Cruise the countryside,

stop in all the colleges
along the way.

Why not? You're still young.

Okay, well, I gotta hear it.
I'm not gonna play it.

Come on, babe.
I don't have the guitar or anything.

Well, you don't need the guitar.
You just have your voice.

Your voice is just fine.

It's always been the best part.
The band just supported it.

I think the band
helped cover the flaws.

No.

[clears throat]

<i>â™ª I've lived my life
Painted in a corner â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All along believing
The ground was wet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And by the time
I came to realize â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Darling
You had already left â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm a damn fool
A damn fool â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I am a damn fool â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I've had time to think â™ª</i>

You cut me loose â™ª</i>

And here's where
you repeat the chorus.

[vehicle approaches]

[engine turns off]

[door slams]

[man whispers]
Shit, shit, shit.

[footsteps shuffling]


[door creaks]

Hey, buddy,
is your mom here?

[door creaks]

Oh, hi. Uh...

Jess, right?
Yeah.

Uh, sorry, thought the little
guy was gonna go get your mom.

She's not home. She's out with my dad.
Oh.

Or, I mean, she's inside
taking a shower, you creeper.

I promise
I'm not a creeper.

Um, do you know
when she'll be back?

Are you a psycho?

Excuse me?

Why do you think I would tell you?
I don't even know you.

No, I know.
Who are you?

I'm just a friend.
I work with your mom. I mean, uh...

Yeah, stopping by really late to
give her flowers. Real friendly.

My friends do that
all the time.

No, I know. Uh, she just...

Your mom got a promotion
at work and...

trying to congratulate her.

Yeah, that doesn't make it
any less weird.

Listen, she goes to work
on Monday,

so if you guys
work together,

you can give her
the flowers yourself.

Actually, do you mind
giving them to her?

Can't you give them
to her at work?

Yeah, but I'd rather
she had them fresh.


Thank you.

[door closes]

Nice meeting you.

[exhales]
[vehicle door opens, closes]

[engine starts]
I'm sorry, I didn't know that he was gonna...

No, look, we made...

[vehicle drives away]

Made an agreement,
and, uh...

Hey, congratulations
on the promotion.

Yeah, thanks.

Are you seeing anyone?
I'd like to...

What's his name?

Derek.

We don't work together.

We just work in the same building.
You don't have to...

Yeah.

[door opens]

[boy] Kill it!
[grunting, stomping]

[Niki chuckles]

Hide the evidence!

some good ones.

They're worth it, Niki.

They're worth us trying.
I know.

[phone buzzing]

It's Jess.
Yup.

I should get back inside.

[clears throat]

Hey.

Can, um...

Can we try this
again sometime?

Of course.

Next time, though, a guitar
needs to accompany that song.

Agreed.

Good night.



[grunts]
[crashes]


You done?



I'm losing her, Dad.

Let me see those.

They're fine.

Why don't you come downstairs?
We'll clean those up.


Theo! Alex!

[dog barking]

[boy groans]

What are you doing here?

Yeah, it's so late.

I didn't get to say bye, so I wanted to
come by and say good night and I love you.

Okay. Love you too.

Where's Bug?

Sleeping with Mom.

Okay.

Hey. So I saw this wino

on the street the other day
and he was eating a grape.

And I was like, "Hey, dude."

What's a wino?

It's like a, uh...

You know, like a homeless guy
that drinks a lot of wine.

All right.

So, no matter how good
I get at tennis,

I'll never be
as good as a wall.

That was not good.

Better jokes, Dad.

Look, if I had
nine fingers cut off,

I wouldn't be
any worse at typing.

Hey, don't shut...
What are you talking about?

This is your guy.
I looked him up on Netflix.

Seriously?

Yes, it's
the Mitch Hedberg guy.

Yeah, but you, like,
picked all the dark chocolates in there.

What are you talking about?
You said the other day, you were like,

"A dog is always
in the push-up position."

Yeah, but that's funny.
That's not funny.

It is really funny.

That's really funny,
but the guy...

Tennis against the wall
is not funny?

That's not funny at all.

Whatever.

You can't be good
at tennis,

but not beat yourself
in tennis.

The point is, it's like the wall.
Like, you can't...

The wall's gonna send it
in any direction.

Yeah, I got that one.
Okay.

It wasn't funny.

Hey, you wanna climb out
and look at the stars?

It's 4:00.

It's not 4:00.

Okay, then, it's like
2:00 in the morning.

All right.

Y'all go to sleep.

Love you, Dad.
I love you too.

All right, get in.

Go get in bed.

Night.

Hey, tell Bug and Jess
I love them, okay?

Okay.


Hey, David.

Hey.
Hey.

Did you wake the boys up
last night and talk to them?

What?

Alex told me you were
telling him and Theo

Mitch Hedberg jokes.

Oh, yeah.

I couldn't sleep last night and
the boys have been telling me

to look up this guy's stuff,
so I did.

I just went over there to share
some of the funny ones with them.

Do you think
that was a good idea?

What, you think
it was a bad one?

I think
it's a little confusing.

What's confusing
about it?

I don't know, their dad knocking on
their window at 4:00 in the morning?

No, no, no. It was 2:30.

[scoffs]
And if I'd have... No, no, hold on, Niki.

If I'd have woken up...
If I was living in the house

and I'd gone in there and got
the boys up to tell 'em a joke,

you wouldn't have a problem, so why do you have one now?
It's not about the jokes.

Then what is it about?
Are you kidding me?

Am I kidding you?

You're gonna come over
here now and give me crap,

when I'm living with my dad and
you're in there with the boys?

Oh, my God.

You've gotta be sensitive to the fact
that I don't get to spend time with them.

So I gotta sneak over there

and tell them something
in the middle of the night

and you hear about it
at breakfast...

You are not the only one.
Fuck you.

Oh, that's nice.
That's nice.

You think...
You hear that? There we go.

Oh, my...

Do you think breakfast is like <i>Leave
It to Beaver</i> or something? You think...

Hold... Look...
Can you look at me?

You think... You think
they were telling on you?

I don't know.
I'm not in the house.

They weren't, okay? They were excited,
like it was a good thing, okay?

Like, they were happy
about it.

You're out of the house
and you're still cool to them.

Don't fucking charge at me
like that.


You're right. It won't happen again.
My apologies.

David, come on, stop.
We need to talk about this.

We already talked about it.
[engine starts]

David, can you stop
the truck, please?

What are you doing? What are you doing?
Can you stop the truck?

[tires screech, engine revving]


Fucking David.

[metal clinking]

[cocks gun]

[gunshots echoing]

[dog barking]

[train horn blows]

[engine starts]

Hi, how are you
doing today?

Good.
Great.

You find everything okay?

Yeah, just looking.
All right.

Well, let me know if you
need a hand with anything.

just holler...

[register beeping]

[boys yelling]

Hey!
[boy] Dad!


What's up, buddy?

Hi!


How are you?

Good. Can we climb
in the back?

Hey, hey, no, no,
don't get in the back.

You can get back there,
but do not go through those bags

and do not look
under the blanket.

Hey.
Could we slide down in there?

Climb in over here.
The door's broken.

Could we ride in the back?

No, you can't ride
in the back.

Give me a kiss. Come on.

Just get in and go, please,
and get this over with?

You can if you pay the toll.

I'm not gonna pay
the toll, Dad.

What is going on?

Load up. Let's go.
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

Drop it.
Something is going on.

Stop, stop, stop.

Whee!

I don't want to talk about it.

If you want me to come,
you'll drop it.

Just leave me alone.

All right, scrunch in.

Scrunch in,
find your place.

Guys.

Jess doesn't want
to sit in the center.

Come on. Sit down.

Fine.

Who's ready for adventure?
Yeah, where are we going?

We're going to the park.

Wait, what's in the back?
What?

Hey, there's a surprise...
Oh!

...at the park, not just the park.
Oh.

What if someone steals the surprise?
What if they take it?

How are they gonna take the prize?
It's in the back.

You said it's at the park,
though.

No, it's in the back,
covered up in the blanket.

That's why I don't want you
guys messing around back there.

All right, how was school?

Awesome.
Mmm, good.

Oh, did I get "awesome"
and "good"?

Good. Kinda nice.

I just hate math.
Why do you hate math?

Math is the only thing
that ruins the school.

I love math.

See?
You're one of the smart people.

Is art the best?
No.

You like art?

Art's good, right?
Yeah, I guess.

Yeah, art's good.

That's your favorite, right, Bug?
Yeah.

Has he got something on his face?
No.

Art, theater, music.

Oh, you bust your noggin?

Yeah.
Running.

You all right?
Yeah.

Was that today?
Yeah.

I ran a mile today.

Oh, yeah?
What was your time on the mile?

Um, I think it's a ten,
but I was in front of everybody.

Oh, nice.
It was pretty good.

That's good. How about you?
Did you run it?

No.

Why?

I don't like running.

Wow.
I would run.

I would run it.

I would run it.

How was school for you?
I don't know.

How was music and art

and recess,
all the fun stuff?

Well, I have, like,
hardly any time with recess.

Well...

Recess is the best.

I have so many friends.
Tyson...

What do you guys play
when you're at recess?

Zombie.
You play Zombie?

We play, like, zombies.

Oh, wait. Zombies, like,
where you shoot zombies?

Yeah, there's these kids
who act like zombies,

then you get to be
a citizen or a shooter.

I mainly be a citizen.

Oh, no, I be
a shooter, actually.

Yeah.

Jess, how about you?
How was school?

Just great.

Who in the vehicle felt sarcasm
from the last statement?

That was sarcasm!

That's just, like,
a tiny bit or a whole lot?

No, a whole lot.
A whole lot.

That was sarcasm. The whole thing.
Yeah.

It's sarcasm.

It was nothing that...

It was definitely good.

It was sarcasm!

Hey, Jess,
you can't have a bad time today.

I dare you
to not have fun.

That's not the point.
Try me.

It's the park
and there's a surprise.

What's the point?
I can't wait. I love surprises!

What do you mean,
what's the point?

What's the point
of someone,

like, doing a surprise
for you,

but then you're like,
"No, I hated it"?

All right, you ready?
Yeah.

Here's this bag.

[boy] Oh!
[David] What do you got in there? What is that?


What's on the pictures?

Maybe...

[boys shouting]


Come on,
let's go launch them.

See this little track?
Whoa, that looks cool.

All right? All right,
see a slide down on there?

Okay, and then
we're gonna clamp, go one...

But what happens when,
like, they're going high?

So there's
this little bit of...

There's this little engine
that's inside there.

So, what,
it puts those off?

Come here.
Yeah, it'll shoot it.

So we're gonna stick
this button in here, okay,

and then you hold
that button. Okay.

Say, "Houston,
we're ready for takeoff"!

Ten, nine, eight, seven...

Whoa! [laughs]

All right.

[explodes]
Boo!


All right, go get it,
go get it.

All right, come back, come
back, come back, come back.

[boy] I want mine next!
You wanna do yours next?

I'm going next, actually.

All right, let's go.

Come on.

Yeah, we'll pack it
all back in there

and put another motor in it.

Okay, could I do one?
Okay.

Yeah, you wanna pitch it?
So, here you go.

Whoa, it all makes...
All right.

All right, here you go.
Just pitch 'em on there.

Good job.

Do that one.
But does it...

Oh, you could hear a buzz.

Uh-huh.

There you go.

Oh, mine doesn't...

Okeydokey.

Go there. Got mine...
Get this...

Good job. We gotta get it
right on the ends there.

There we go.
Okay.

All right,
you grab your controller.

Okay, where is it?

You see it?
Right here.

All right,
everybody back up.

All right. Okay.

Ten, nine...
You do this button right here.

Seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one!

Whoa!
Catch it!

All right, try to catch it,
try to catch it.

[explodes]
[yelling]

Hey, Jess,
you want to do yours?

Come on. Come on.

Hey! Alex, you okay if Jess goes?
Yeah.

All right,
let's see the big one.

Let's get the big boy.

Let's get the big boy!
All right.

You want to hook it up?
Okay.

All right, come on.
Here you go.

How do you do it?

All right, so,
we'll take it right here...

[coughing] This one's gonna be big.
We'll put this one here,

and we'll put it
right here.

All right.
All right, boys.

Houston, we are ready
for launch.

I'm gonna count yours.
Okay.

You ready?

Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six,

five, four, three,
two, one, go!

Dad, it's not going.

Okay, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

All right. Let's go.

Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six,

five, four, three,
two, one, go!

It's not working. It's not working, Dad.
Yeah, no, push this button.

I clicked the button!
Push this button.

Hey, hold on.
I hate this!

Hey! Hey! Hey, Jess!

What are you doing?

Hey!
What you did!

What do you mean,
what I did?

You got mad
and walked away.

I did not get mad
and walk away.

Now don't do this here in
front of the boys. Stop it!

That's exactly
what you did!

I did not do anything.

You know I'm fighting
as hard as I can for this.

I don't want this. You think I want to
bring you guys down to a park on Saturday?

Come on!

I don't wanna do this.


I'm sorry.

It sucks for everybody.

[sniffles]
I promise, though, I'm trying.

Take me home.

Come on. Let's just try
to fix this up.

No, I wanna go home.

[bell tolling]

Hey, I'm sorry.

Hey, next time, okay? You get to go next time.
Okay.

All right. Come on,
let's get our stuff.

Let's get our stuff.

Could we keep
the parachute?

Yeah, you can keep
the parachute.

You can keep
the whole rocket.

Can we hang them up
on our wall?

Yeah, we'll hang them up inside your room.
That sound good?

Yeah.

Thank you, Dad.
Hey, that was so awesome

when it went up, though,
wasn't it?

Jess. Jess!


All right, here.
I was gonna save these

till after we launched
the rockets.

Pick your flavor.

All right. There you go.


What's going on?

Hey, Mom, Dad got us
rockets and Jess broke hers

and Alex
didn't get to shoot one.

[sighs]
That's pretty play-by-play.

Hey, boys, why don't you run in the
house quick and let me talk to Mom?

Are we gonna stay the night?
Yeah.

Just let me talk to Mom
and then we'll head out.

Hey, why don't you guys
go to the Thompsons?

I saw the boys
on their bikes earlier.

Yeah?
That sound like a good idea?

Okay.
All right. Go see the Thompson boys.

We'll call you.

Come on.


Bye, Buggy.
Bye.

What's up?

What do you mean?

Jess was pissed
when I picked up the kids.

She was?
Yeah.

Okay. I asked her
not to be.

What does that mean,
you asked her not to be?

A bunch of her friends
were going to a show tonight,

and she really
wanted to go.

And?
And I told her she couldn't 'cause it's your time with them.

Are you serious?

What, David?

What do you mean, "What, David?"
It's true.

But you can't
keep doing this.

You can't tell her
that she can't do something.

It implies that
if it wasn't for me,

you wouldn't have
a problem with it.

But I wouldn't.
It doesn't matter if you would or wouldn't.

When you say no,
it's making this time with me negative.

That's all
she's associating it with.

So tell her she...
Make up some excuse, say whatever it is.

I will not teach our children
how to lie, David.

Then tell her
that it's my decision.

Say, "Go ask your dad,"
so that I can decide.

I can make that decision,
Niki.

I don't have to
have you do it for me.

You gotta be sensitive
to how we talk to the kids.

This is hard enough as it is.
You're not being nice or considerate.

I'm sorry, okay?
Are you?

I didn't even think about it.
It just sort of slipped out,

because if she was home with me,
I wouldn't have a problem with it.

But then I remembered
that you had them...

David, this is new.

This is my family, Niki.

I know.
Do you?

'Cause if you're not thinking
about this all the time,

then you need
to cut me loose.

Because I think about it
all fucking day.

This is hard.

So, if you can't find
some way to be considerate

and we can't find a dialogue,
then you move out,

and you take them
on the weekends,

because I only agreed to do
this because you promised me

that we were going to
work through this.

This is hard enough being away from
you, but when I gotta...

David, I'm sorry. Okay?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Look at me. Look at me.
I fucked up, okay?

I'm sorry. Okay?

[Derek] Everything okay out here?
It's just hard.

Yeah, we're fine.

I'm sorry, I didn't know you were coming back.
You kidding me?

I come pick up the kids,
and you're gonna have

a fuck fest in my house
with this guy?

David, that's not
what is going on, okay?


Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.

You sure? Really
doesn't sound like it.

conversation about our kids, man,

so if you could just go somewhere,
take a walk or something, man,

I'd really appreciate it.

I think maybe I should be a part of
the conversation, don't you think?

Uh... [chuckles] Are you
serious with this guy?

Don't talk about me
like I'm not here.

Then don't stand here
and try to have...

Like you have any value in this conversation.
It's fine. We're fine.

I'm fine. We're okay.
Just go in the house.

I'm talking about our children,
our family, our marriage.

So just
get out of here, man.

I don't think so.

Look, I think
maybe it's important

that I be a part of it
at this point.

It's not important.

You have zero value
in this conversation.

Go somewhere...
I don't appreciate how you're talking to my girlfriend.

Your girlfriend?
Yes.

This is my wife. My wife!
Okay, okay, okay.

You know what that means?
Hey, hey!

That is my house
you're staying in.

David, take a breath.
Mine!

You understand that?
Derek, let's go. Okay?

You're a pathetic piece
of garbage.

You just prey on women...
Okay, take a breath.

You can't find single women
that you can hang out with?

Derek, just go in the house.
You got no game? Huh?

You gotta come round here, somebody's trying
to work through their marriage issues

and swoop in on people
that are vulnerable?

You're a fucking leech.

You're a bottom feeder,
you piece of fucking shit.

Take a breath, David.
Take a breath.

Derek, come on,
just go in the house.

I can't at this point.

If you give us a minute,
we could probably work this out.

Derek, I promise you,
we don't need a minute.

That's the last thing we need.
I'd appreciate it if you went inside, Niki.

Dave, please just go.
Go. Okay?

You feel like a big dick standing in front of my house?
Okay, stop.

With my wife and kids?
You feel tough?

David, get in your truck
and go.

I'm not leaving
without the kids.

Derek,
let's go in the house.

So you and your
fucking boyfriend can do...

David, get in your truck
and leave!

I'm not leaving.
I'm waiting for the kids.

Call Mrs. Thompson,
tell her to send the boys down.

Tell Jess to grab her crap.
Let's go.

You think
that's a good idea?

It's happening.

I don't care if it's a
good idea or a bad idea.

David, I will bring them by in ten minutes.
I'm not leaving.

Niki, give us a minute and everything will be fine.
Derek, stop.

We don't need a minute,
Derek.

I can promise you the last thing
we need is a fucking minute.

Go get Jesse
and the boys

and by the time
you get back,

we will have this
figured out.

What do you say, dude?

can go fuck yourself.

All right, wait, guys.
You know what, listen.

I think this is... I think this is
getting a little crazy, all right?

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I apologize.

That's not me.
You know that.

David, you too, man.

I'm sorry, all right?

I am new to this dynamic.

I think that we all are.

And I realize that
I am forcing myself in,

but I think that that is
a natural thing to want to do

with somebody that I care
about as much as her.

Hey, my man. Right here.
Look. No disrespect, okay?

I get that I got
in the middle of something.


This thing got nothing
to do with you, buddy.

It's much bigger than you.
You need to get the heck out of here.

He doesn't listen.
It doesn't matter.

David and I need to talk about
this, figure it out.

If I'm gonna be here
for any length of time,

we need to start off
on the right foot.

start off on the right foot, okay?

We'll get there, okay?
Just go get Jesse and the boys

and by the time
you get them back here,

me and him, we will work this
out, I promise you that.

That okay with you,
David?

Whatever gets the kids
in the truck,

I'm so happy with.

Cool. Okay.
You can call...

Niki can call,
she can stop by your dad's later,

and you guys
can work your thing out...

I don't care what she does.
Just get the kids.

I mean, what is it,
100 yards?

You can go by later.

You guys can work your thing
out after we work our thing out.

I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry. It's okay.

This sort of thing happens.

I don't know,
what did you hope to accomplish?

No, I know.

[both grunting]

[David groaning]

I'm a piece of garbage, huh?
Is that right?

You are a pile of garbage,
David.

You don't deserve that woman.

[David groaning]

[breathing heavily]

[engine starts]

David! David!



[sound fades]


[engine idling]




David!

Are you okay?
Breathe, David.


I'm here.

I don't know what to do.

I love you.
I don't know what to do.

I love you so much.
I love you.


Hey, hey, y'all go put those things up.
[boy] Come on!

Hey, don't touch
unless we bought it.

With your eyes, not your hands.
[boy] Can we buy 'em?

Hey, babe?
No, we can't buy 'em.

Huh?
What do you think of these?

What's wrong with
the ones we got?

Nothing.
It's just, these are smart.

It's an upgrade.

Smart?

with anything?

Just looking
at your washers.

I was telling my husband
everything's moving to smart now.

That's very much true.

Can you tell him
what that means?

Yeah, definitely.

Uh, well,
this specific machine,

it's got a weight sensor
in the washer

so it can tell
how big the load is,

and then it can use that
to decide

how much liquid soap
to put in for the best clean.

But I thought
that's what that little...

Like, the little cup that
goes at the top of the...

Oh, yeah, of course.
But this way, you can just load the soap

and you don't have to worry about
putting the soap in yourself.

The coolest thing
about this one, though,

is that it will send you a
text when the wash is done,

so you can stay
on top of your laundry.

I imagine
with all these kids,

you're always
just juggling that.

Never ends.
Yeah.

Well, did you have any more
questions about this one?

Could it fit him in it?

Yeah, probably.
This is an extra big, extra large.

Get him!
