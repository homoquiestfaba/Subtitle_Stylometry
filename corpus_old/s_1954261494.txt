WOMAN: What does the map say?

MAN: The map says...

(BLOWS AIR)
that we are out of phone range.

(WOMAN SIGHS)

MAN: We're gonna be fine.
Look where we are.

We're on an adventure right now.

Just out of curiosity...
what time does the sun set?

MAN: Mm...

I'm... I'm planning on not brushing
my teeth for the entire trip.

WOMAN: You will be... you will
definitely be brushing your teeth.

MAN: No, I don't think I'm going to.
Oh, yeah, it's happening.

No.
If I have to knock you out

and do it myself.

MAN: You're gonna brush my
teeth while I'm unconscious?

WOMAN: Yes.
That's very nice of you.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

I never knew you loved me so much.
Oh, yeah.

MAN: What are you doing?
(LAUGHING)

What are you doing? Stop it.

Stop it.
Ooh!

I'm gonna turn around, pee on you.
No, no!

Uh, babe.
Yeah?

I think it is official...
we are lost.

MAN: I... I don't feel lost.
Do you feel lost?

Are you tired?

You're tired, aren't you?
I know you're tired.

Hey, open your eyes. Open your eyes.
Yeah, they're open. They're open.

WOMAN: I need to stop for a second.

Let's just... you're right.
We should just stay out here.

We'll get a little bit
of sleep and then...

MAN: I can't wait to start
shooting this thing tomorrow.

WOMAN:
I bet the stars are pretty tonight.

MAN: Holy mol...
WOMAN: What?

MAN: Okay, I'm signing up.
(WOMAN LAUGHS)

MAN: We're in.
I'm never going back home.

That's it.

Wow.

This is the place, right?

MAN: Oh, my God, my back.
It's so charming, isn't it?

MAN: Ugh.

Whoa! Oh, my... it's perfect.

Hey, I was thinking you and I
can start a nudist colony here.

What do you think?
Um, sign me up.

Yeah? Sign you up?
Oh, my God, there's a rocking chair!

MAN: Oh, my...
This is... this is...

Oh, my...
This is incredible.

MAN: It's insane.

WOMAN: Wow!

I think you're scaring the birds.
Uh-oh.

MAN NARRATING: Do you ever wish
your life had an eject button?

Good morning.


I'm happy to report the sun
rose again in the east today,

right on schedule.
(NARRATING) Do you ever fantasize

about selling everything
and moving to the woods?

Do you ever dream about
waking up to birds

instead of your alarm clock?

Have you ever wanted
to blow all your money

on extremely nice camera equipment

to make a nature
documentary so beautiful,

people who saw it would never want
to watch another movie again?

Good morning.

I think I found nirvana last night,

7:43,

and I was standing right there.

walk around your yard naked?

Do you ever wish you
could freeze time?

Do you ever wish you
could kiss your wife

the way you did on the
night you first met?

Well, the sun rose again today.

A bird flew by.

A squirrel ate a nut.

WOMAN: So this thing...

you're... this is recording
you while it's recording me?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Pretty sweet, right?

I have one fabulous,
genius boyfriend.

to suspect you made a huge mistake?

You're so smart. Mwah.

you were in over your head?

(WOMAN LAUGHS)

Have you ever realized you
can't really go back?

Whee.

Well, it's interesting out here.

You know, being in the woods is...

to the woods for a whole year

to work on your relationship,

only a month in you missed
your TV more than you thought?

Plus, you stopped taking your meds

and you have no idea what this
movie is about in the first place.

Let's face it...

trading in your studio
apartment for a bunch of trees

doesn't really change anything.
WOMAN: Come on.

What are you doing right now?

photography career on hold for you

so you are too ashamed to admit that
the documentary you moved here to make

wasn't that well
thought out anyway?


What?

But what if your real problems

are much, much worse than that?

PENNY: You haven't shot
anything for weeks.

Penny.
Hey, come on.

Stop.

troubles are the least of your worries?

PENNY: Doesn't want to
get out of his hammock.

Doesn't want to film anything.
Oh, all right.

I don't know why. I don't know why.
All right, I get it.

else was out there?

I love you. I'm just not in the mood.
Why aren't you in the mood?

Can you open the door now, please?

Oh, my God.

hadn't been disturbed

for a long, long time.

What if you came to the
woods to find solitude,

only you found out you
weren't really alone?

(INSECTS CHIRPING)

MAN: I'm sorry about earlier.

I shouldn't have yelled
at you like that.

PENNY: It's fine.

I... you... I think you were right.

I just... I needed
to shoot some stuff.

And I really need a swift
kick in the ass, that's all.

So thank you for that, seriously.

MAN: Mm, that's nice.

Isn't that nice?

I think we just needed some
relaxation time, you know?

Let me give you a massage.

Come on, let me give you a massage.

Relaxation time. Free
massage on the house.

PENNY: What are you doing?

MAN: Giving you pleasure.
No.

I mean, what's going on with you?

MAN: Nothing. I'm good, all good.

Are you good?

PENNY:
Honestly, I'm... I'm kind of...

I've been worried about you.

MAN:
You don't need to be. Just relax.

PENNY: No, you've been acting

really alarmingly...
Yeah.

In the last couple of...

MAN:
I know. I just... you know, I...

I just... I stopped taking my pills
temporarily when we first got out here.

But I'm fine. I really...

I'm really loving...
You stopped taking your pills?

MAN: No, I... no. Uh...

I gave up everything to
come out here with you.

I left my job, my friends.

And you promised me...
you promised me

that you would be responsible.
Yeah. You know what, Penny?

Let's just go to sleep and talk
about this tomorrow, okay?

No. No. I want to
talk about it now.

(SIGHS)

(SCOTT GROANS)

Aw, come...

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

(BIRDS CALLING)

(THUNDER CRASHING)



(CREATURES GROWLING)


(THUNDER RUMBLING)




Babe.

Babe. Scott.
Hmm? Hmm?

What is that?
What?

You hear that?

What?

(THUD)
PENNY: What the hell is that?

SCOTT: It's nothing.

(THUDDING CONTINUES)

SCOTT: What the...?

(LOUD THUD)

SCOTT: Turn off the light.
Turn off the light.

(CREATURE SNARLING)

What is it?

(PENNY SCREAMING)
SCOTT: Jesus! Jesus. What is that?

What is that?
(THUDDING CONTINUES)

PENNY: What is it?
SCOTT: I don't know. I don't know.

(COUGHS)
SCOTT: Are you...

are you all right?
Yeah.

SCOTT:
What the hell's going on out there?

Okay, just stay there.

I'm gonna go take a look.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

It's... it's just birds.
It's just birds.

(WINGS FLUTTER)
(GLASS SHATTERS)

(PENNY SHOUTS) Shit!

Why are they flying into the house?
I don't know.

Why are they flying into the house?

SCOTT: I don't know!
What are we supposed to do?

SCOTT: I don't know.
They're just... they're not gonna...

PENNY: Jesus.
They're just birds.

They're not gonna hurt us.
(GLASS SHATTERING)

Everything's okay. They're gonna be...
No, stop...

So...

it's day 52.

And...

Penny and I are...

It was good. You know,
last night was good.

Sometimes you just gotta let
the blood out, you know,

just get the passion...
passion pumping, you know?

When you come out to
a place like this,

it's like there's this huge wall

just...

That's where it's at.
It's really good stuff.

You know, it's...

Hey. Hey! Hey!

Hey! You have my car keys!

Hey!

(SCOTT PANTING)

I have to show you something.

Scott, Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry.

SCOTT: There it is.

PENNY: Jesus, whose house is that?

(SCOTT WHISPERING)
Come on, come on, come on.

Can you believe this place
was right under our noses?

Okay, come on.
Scott, wait.

Scott, what are you doing?

Scott, Scott.
Hello?

Let's go.
Shh, hold on.

Come on, this is stupid.
Shh.

(DOOR CREAKING)

SCOTT: Excuse me.

Anybody here?

Whew.

Okay.

PENNY: All right, come on, let's go.
Hello?

Scott.
Shit, where's my backpack?

PENNY: Okay, I'm leaving.

Is someone here?
Just come on.

Just come with me.
I don't want to, Scott.

Just come with me.

What the hell is this?
Shh. Shh.

What the hell are you
looking for, Scott?

Scott.

SCOTT: Whoa.

Okay, come here quick.

No.

Just come in here.
Why?

I need you to be my lookout, okay?

Oh, uh-uh. No. No.
I... just...

just... Penny, wait. Just...

Penny. Penny. Penny. Penny.

Come here. Just come here.
Scott. No, Scott.

Shh. Come here.
Whose house is this?

I don't know. It's just
some squatter guy.

I just... I have to go
down there for a second.

That's all, okay?
Go where?

There?
Yes.

Why would you want
to go down there?

Why did he take your backpack?
What's down there?

I left... I left the keys in there.

You what?
Yeah.

That's a 10-mile hike to the road.
I know.

I already know, okay?
I'm an idio...

Don't go in there, okay?

This is the most interesting
thing I've seen in a month.

Just let me know if he comes, okay?

Scott. Scott!

Jesus. Scott!

(MICROPHONE SCRAPES)


Holy shit.

Holy shit.

Holy shit.

Shit.

Jesus.

Wow. Wow.

PENNY: Oh, my...
I found it.

We've got to get out
of here right now.

Come on.
Okay, hold on.

Wait, Scott. Have you seen this?
No waiting. We've got to go.

No, no, no.
Have you seen this stuff?

We've got to get out of here.
Wow. Wow.

This is like...
Shh.

This can't be what I think it is.
We've got to get out of here.

PENNY: Wait, what's in here?
Is this his studio?

SCOTT: We've got to go.
Hold this for one second.

Just hold it for one second.
One second. One second.

Come on, take it. Got it?

Oh, my God.

Penny, this guy could
come back any second.

Wait, wait. Let's look at this.

This is... let's see
what's in here.

Penny, serious...
I think it's stuck. Come on.

SCOTT: Jesus.

(WOOD CREAKS)
Wait. Stop, stop. Shh.

(DEBRIS FALLS)
(FOOTSTEPS)

Okay, come on.
What? Stop, stop, stop, stop.

Wait, what? Let's go talk to him.
No, wait. Wait.

We just broke into
this guy's house.

You think he really wants neighbors
just, like, dropping by?


(LOUD THUD)


Penny, come on. Come on.


SCOTT: Shh, shh, shh.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

(FLASHLIGHT CLICKS)
(DEBRIS FALLING)


(FLASHLIGHT CLICKS)

(TRAPDOOR OPENS)

Shh.

Penny.

(DOOR CREAKS)

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I know.

Oh, my God.
I know. I know.

That just happened.
I know. It just happened.

That was incredible!
I know. I know. He's a total...

No, Scott.
He's a total psycho, right?

No. No, Scott. No, Scott.
He so is. I thought he was gonna...

And, like, act out his fantasies.
Jones. It's Mr. Jones.

Mr. Jones!

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

(SCOTT GRUNTS)

PENNY: Are you positive
this is where you saw him?

SCOTT: Yeah, I think so.

Yeah, definitely here.
I'm pretty sure he came out here.

PENNY:
You know, no one's ever been able

to figure out who this guy is.

He's crazy.
Yeah, shh.

It's like we're living next door to,
like, J.D. Salinger or Banksy.

Shh!

Hey, Scott, we have got to go
back down in that basement.

We gotta take more
pictures, you know?

We could do, like, a full, like...

like, a huge, like,

full-color-page coffee table book.
Okay, you gotta...

I think tomorrow

you should start interviewing
some of these guys, you know?

What?
Yeah. I'll make you, like...

I'll make you a list, you know,
of, like... of his curator

or the guy that wrote the
monograph for him at the MOMA.

Yeah.
You're gonna have to go to New York.

What?
You're gonna have to find these guys.

They're in New York, basically.

You know?

But what, are you gonna stay here?

Well, I mean, I think I...
I think I have to, right?

I mean... I mean...

what do you think?
Yeah, yeah.

I think it's good.

Holy shit. There's another one.

PENNY: I'm standing right next
to Mr. Jones' scarecrows.

I'm totally staying here.
I've got...

I've got way too many
pictures to take.

Insane.

This guy is disturbed.
PENNY: You know what?

I could also shoot some
footage for the documentary.

It might be kind of
interesting, actually,

to have my perspective
and your perspective

at the same time in the film.
What do you think?

I mean, only if you're cool with
it, 'cause this is your thing.

Yeah. No, it's good. I like it.
Yeah? Yeah?

I think it... cool.

Well, um...
(AIRPLANE ENGINE HUMMING)

PENNY:
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

(TOOTHBRUSH SWISHES)

Uh, I left you a message

about possibly interviewing
you later today.

I'm just... the first time I'm...
Yeah?

Okay. All right. So... and then
we'll just have you sit right here.

MAN: All right.
And...

why you're interested, but...

you don't have to tell
me if you don't want to.

SCOTT: Why do you run your website
if you're so afraid of him?

To help people.

You ready?

Testing. Blah, blah, blah.

Master's degree in both
consciousness studies

and alternative medicine.

And I'm working on my dissertation

at the University of Somewhere.

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

So where do you want me to start?

(BIRDS CHIRPING)
(TRAFFIC BLARING)

SCOTT: Tell us about how
you discovered Mr. Jones.

MAN: Okay.

So one day, early '70s,

I ran a gallery in the Village,

and I get this huge
crate in the mail.

You could have fit a
refrigerator in there.

I open it up, and there
is sitting there,

inside, this thing.

I started to get reports

about these people
getting these packages

all over the country...
a dentist in Oregon,

a bartender in Iowa.

I had no idea why these people
were being singled out,

but it intrigued me.

And I go home and I
have about five drinks.

And I go to bed.

I can't get the thing
out of my head.

I just couldn't get
it out of my head.

Finally I wake up from this dream

where I'm actually having a dream
inside the dream about finding it.

Nobody knew who he was.
Nobody still knows.

There were all these
crazy rumors...

he was a concentration camp guard
who was hiding out in Georgia.

He was on death row.

It was a housewife in Ohio.
He was a mental patient.

He was a dentist in Washington
State. He was...

Mr. Jones.
That was me... I named him.

I was pretty angry at
the world at this time.

I was about to go broke.

So I just hung this thing

in the front window of the gallery.

And it stopped traffic.

When I first saw Mr. Jones'
famous scarecrows,

I immediately thought of
totem poles, tribal masks,

guardian figures that
occur in every culture

who stop the evil spirits

that dwell in the dark from
breaking into our home.

SCOTT: So what happened next?

Um, well, eventually
they just stopped.

And that was it. And I
thought Mr. Jones was done.

SCOTT: So you think you
got an actual piece

sent to you by Mr. Jones.

I don't think I did. I did.

SCOTT: I mean, most experts think

he sent these things
out in the '70s.

How do you know it was real?

It was real.

I know it was.

There are nine verified Jones
pieces in the world... nine.

If someone found an
authentic Jones,

I could get seven figures
for it tomorrow, easy.

But if it was a new piece,
any new piece, contemporary,

like what he's doing now...

whew.

SCOTT: If these are worth so much,
then why did you destroy it?

I met a lot of people that were
mailed totems by Mr. Jones.

And most of them

just say that they were
disturbed and moved on.

But if you actually start talking
to the people around them...

their husbands, their wives,

their friends, their
colleagues, their parents...

then you start to get
a different story.

SCOTT: Why do you think
he singled you out?

I have no idea.

CAVAGNARO: And you dig deeper
into the lives of these people,

and you noticed even
more drastic changes,

extreme personality
shifts, disappearances,

housewives leaving their families
and moving into the woods.

It's disturbing.

Who do you think
you're dealing with?

SCOTT: I'm sorry?

Do you think this is, like,
a painter or something?

You have no idea who
you're dealing with.

This guy... you don't know
what he's capable of.

And he's still out there.

He's sending these things
out to innocent people.

And we don't know why or
we don't... nobody cares.

Nobody's doing anything about it.

You've got no idea what these
things do to your mind.

What... what do you...
what do you mean?

They get inside your
mind and they explode.

(PHONE LINE RINGING)

(PHONE LINE RINGING)

Okay.

At the tone, please
record your message.

When you are finished
recording, you may hang up...

SCOTT: Hey, Penny. It's me again.

I don't know if you're still not
getting any reception or not,

but if you're getting these,
I just want to say good night.

Hope you're being careful.
I miss you.

I hope you're not ruining
my documentary...

(VOICE FADES)

(CAMERA BEEPS)

Hey, babe.

Um, I'm here.

And you are...

who knows?

Somewhere in New York.

Um...

and I miss you.

(CHIMES TINKLING)
No sign of Mr. Jones,

but I've been taking
a lot of pictures.

And...
(AIRPLANE ENGINE HUMMING)

I don't know, these things
seem so familiar...

hypnotic.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

(INSECTS CHIRPING)
(BIRDS CALLING)

(PHONE LINE RINGING)

(RAIN PATTERING)

(PHONE BEEPS)

SCOTT: Still not sure if
you're getting these,

but just please be careful, okay?

I've been hearing some
kind of disturbing things

about this guy, all right?

Just don't go into the woods
until I get back, all right?


(FLIES BUZZING)

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

Oh.

Hi. I'm... I'm...

I'm... I'm Penny.

Sir, I think your work is amazing.

And, um, I was...

I was actually just
taking pictures,

'cause I want to create a book.

Um...

Um...

You know what?

Would... would you be okay if...

if we did an interview maybe?

Um, I just

am so inspi...

Uh, or, you know what?

I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

Uh, maybe I'll just...

(OBJECT BEING DRAGGED)

(INSECTS CHIRPING)

(BIRDS CALLING)

PENNY: Scott, you need
to see them in the dark.

(FLASHLIGHT CLICKS)
It's like the air around them is...

is vibrating.



(CREATURES SNARLING)

(PENNY PANTING)

Scott?

(PENNY PANTING)

(CREATURE HOWLING)

(VOICES WHISPERING)

(CREATURE HOWLING)

(VOICES WHISPERING)


Oh, God.

(CREATURE SCREAMS)

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

No. No, no, please.

Please.

Please. Please.

Okay.

Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.


Oh, my God.

PENNY: Okay.

So I just feel like I
need to record this

before I forget.

'Cause I feel like

I just woke up from
a dream, you know?

Um...

You know... you know how in a dream

you... you can tell if someone is

trying to hurt you or help you?

Like, you know, you can...

you don't just see into them,

you see, like, right... right
through them, you know?

Huh.

It's like I could...
I could feel his intentions.

You know?

And I don't feel scared.

ASSAF: So-called primitive people

didn't see the world the way we do.

They thought the dream
world was real,

not some meaningless neurological
side effect of sleep.

There was the waking
world of order,

cause and effect, time and space...
(CAR HORN HONKS)

and another, a very real world

that you glimpsed in dreams.

(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
SCOTT: Hey.

PENNY: Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

CAVAGNARO: It is hard to
believe that one person,

after so many years,
could be responsible

for building all of these totems and
sending them all over the world.

So there's some that
posit that perhaps

there is a secret group
or sect at work here,

building these things
and sending them out

for ceremonial purposes.

These talismans were
created by the holy men

to patrol the borders of these
two worlds as they overlapped,

kind of where the photo
dissolves into another,

to keep the chaos and insanity

and nightmares of the dream
world from entering our own.

Maybe they're working together.

Maybe they're all on their own.

Maybe they're all inspired
by the same dreams.

It's almost as if the
Mr. Jones mythos

has a life of its own,

constantly striving to survive
by feeding on our imaginations

and in the process occasionally
transforming people

into additional Mr. Joneses.

SCOTT: So what happened after you
got the statue from Mr. Jones?

It's not really a statue, is it?

Okay, then. What should I call it?

There's not really a word for it.

So what happened to you?

I started having a nightmare.

SCOTT: So what would we see
if we saw this other world?

Depends on what we bring to it.

An inverse reflection of our own...

madness, bedlam,

paradoxes that will
split your mind.

SCOTT: Can you tell us
about this nightmare?

Um, I'm chasing myself.

I'm trying to hurt myself.

And if I catch myself...

it's gonna spill out and
infect the whole world.

So this is a dream you
have, like, every night?

You don't understand.
I started having the dream.

I haven't stopped.

SCOTT: So what would happen if
these guys failed at their job?

You could forever be lost

in the purgatory of
these two worlds

or have the courage to
see yourself as a whole

in both worlds... the awake
world and the dream world.

SCOTT: Tell us a little
bit about the troubles

you've been having in your life.

(DISTANT SIREN WAILING)

No, I don't think I want
to talk about that.

LANE: Like, I know you
guys think you're telling,

like, a fun little story,
but you need to stop.

Don't talk to anyone else
who's had contact with him.

Don't try to track down his works.

Don't look for him.

And if you think you
have found Mr. Jones,

don't speak to him,
don't listen to him.

Don't... don't go near him.

And if he comes near you...

run.

SCOTT:
Look, we do have to be careful,

but, Penny, that guy I interviewed
obviously had problems.

I mean, everyone else I talked to...

if they found out we found
Mr. Jones, it would be huge.

If we're really gonna
make this documentary,

we gotta explore that basement.

And you gotta take
pictures of his workshop.

I feel like we only saw a tenth
of that place the first time.

It would be the perfect
ending for this movie.

Yeah.

Penny.
Yeah.

SCOTT:
You know, we'll use walkie-talkies.

I don't know, like,
keep an eye out for him

so he doesn't, like... what?

What's up?

PENNY: They're gone.

SCOTT: Wow.

Oh, my gosh.

I... I don't know.

I can't. I can't really...

I can't really explain it.

SCOTT: What happened here?

This is incredible.

Just, you know, tell me...

tell me what you were
telling me before

about how it was a dream.

That was really good.

This is so trippy.

PENNY: I mean, if he's using
these as scarecrows, then...

I felt like he was leading
me home, you know?

And...

whatever he's...

It was like he was... he was
trying to get me away from...

from whatever he's trying
to scare away, you know?

Whatever he sees out...

Penny.

You okay?

They're so familiar.

(INSECTS CHIRPING)

(DOOR CREAKS)

Okay. Okay.

Okay!

So I'm just gonna go in there
for, like, two seconds.

I'm gonna come right back.

Okay?

Everything's...
everything's gonna be okay.

Okay.

PENNY: Okay.
Okay.

Whew.
(FLASHLIGHT CLICKS)

One, two, three.

What the hell?

(OPENS TRAPDOOR)

Okay, I'm definitely
in the basement.

(PENNY OVER RADIO) I can
hear you. It's all clear outside.

SCOTT: Okay, good.

All right.

Okay, I'm at the hatch.

Jesus.

Okay, there is a ladder.

And it goes down.

Okay, I'm going down.

PENNY:
Okay, just be quick, all right?

SCOTT: I forgot the camera.

Okay.

Okay.

Oh, my God.

There's like a whole
'nother level down here.

Wow.

This is crazy.

PENNY:
All right, Scott, checking in.

How's it going?

Scott?
Yeah, I hear you.

Looks like it goes on for miles.

PENNY: Scott, be careful.

SCOTT: Don't worry. I'm fine.

This is crazy.

This way?

Okay, so this way.

Can you hear me?

Penny, can you hear me?

(STATIC CRACKLING)
SCOTT: Can you hear me?

Scott, you're breaking up,
all right? You're...

(SCOTT'S VOICE GARBLED)
You're breaking up.

I don't know how he finds
his way around this place.

There's... this is...
this is a total maze.

I see a light.

Penny.

(BIRD CALLING)

SCOTT: What?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my...

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Whoa. This place is...

this place is huge.

I'm... Penny, can you hear me?

(VOICES WHISPERING)

SCOTT: Man.

Oh.

Wow.

Oh, my gosh.

Look at that thing.

(RADIO BEEPS)
I've never...

I've never seen anything like this.
(RADIO BEEPS)

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
Scott, Jones is here. Scott.

(SCOTT'S VOICE GARBLED)
Scott.

Penny, if you can hear me,
this place is crazy.

Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott.
Scott, Jones is here.

I mean, there's torches
and there's these...

more of these big scarecrows
and there's this little guy.

Get out now.
(SCOTT'S VOICE GARBLED)

Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott.

I wish you could see this.

Jones is in the house.

Jones is in the house.
Get out of the house.

Screw it.

Just get out of the house.

Oh, my God.

(RADIO BEEPS)
Scott, get out of that house.

Scott, Scott.
Penny, can you hear me?


(METAL SQUEAKING)




Penny.

Penny, I really need you right now.

I really need you to
hear me right now.

I don't know where the fuck...

(RADIO SQUEALING)

What? No, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no, no.
This can't be happening.

I was just here.

(VOICES WHISPERING)

(SCOTT'S VOICE) Penny.

(SCOTT'S VOICE) Penny.


Whew. Okay.

Whew.

Okay.

Pull it together, Scotty.

Pull it together.

Okay, that was real.

(FOOTSTEPS THUDDING)

(STONE SCRAPING)

(FOOTSTEPS POUNDING)

SCOTT: It's all in your head.

This is all in your head.

What? What the hell?

It can't be a dead end.

I was just here.

That's impossible.

That's impossible.


Penny.

(FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE)

Penny.

(MOUTHING WORDS)

Shit.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(RECEDING FOOTSTEPS)

(FLASHLIGHT CLICKS)

That's impossible.

That's not the way.

You're freaking out.

What the hell was that?

This is not happening.

(PANTING, GRUNTING)

I know where it is.

I know where... oh, man.

Oh, my God, that's it. Oh, my God.


Oh, my God.

(DOOR CREAKS)

Penny.


Where are you? Penny!

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

(ENGINE STARTS, STOPS)

Penny, Penny,
it's locked. Open the door.

This is not working. What did you do?
Nothing. Nothing.

I'm not doing anything.
He's doing this.

Jesus Christ!
All right, all right. Whoa, whoa.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Get out of the car.

(CREATURES HOWLING)
Get out of the car. You hear that?

Get back inside. Get back inside.

Get back inside, go! Go!

(THUNDER CRASHES)
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

Mr. Jones saved me from the woods.
What are you talking...?

He's out there right now terrorizing us.
You think he's saving you?

PENNY: It's like the first time when
you weren't here. He's saving us.

SCOTT: Pull it together.
He's trying to tell us something.

PENNY: We have to leave.
We can't leave.

It's a 10-mile hike in
the middle of the night.

PENNY: Will you just listen to me?
Listen to me.

We are not safe in this house.
Shh, shh!

SCOTT:
I don't know what's wrong with it.

The battery's fine.
Everything's fine.

It just doesn't work.

In the morning we'll
get out of here, okay?

Okay.

When does the sun rise?

6:30, I think, right?

PENNY: Mm-hmm.
Hey.

Everything's gonna be okay.

(WOOD CREAKING)

(CREATURE SNARLING)

It'll be okay.

It's gonna be fine.


It's okay. It's okay.

(PENNY CRYING)

SCOTT'S VOICE: What happened
to you out there in the woods?

PENNY'S VOICE: I don't know.
It's okay.

PENNY'S VOICE: I just woke up here.

SCOTT'S VOICE:
It doesn't make any sense.

He's doing something to us.

I wish I hadn't gone down there.

I mean, it was...

sick.

I'm sorry.

PENNY'S VOICE: About what?

SCOTT'S VOICE: Everything.

PENNY'S VOICE: You don't have
anything to be sorry about.

SCOTT'S VOICE:
As soon as it gets light...

we run.

It's gonna be light out soon.

It'll be a nice walk in the woods.

We're gonna be fine.

What time is it?

6:15.

We've got about 10 minutes
before we gotta go, okay?

PENNY: Mm-hmm.
Let's get ready.

Penny.

We're gonna be fine, okay?

PENNY:
Scott, why isn't it light yet?

SCOTT: It's just a storm.

PENNY: It's 8:00 in the morning
and it's midnight out there.

That's not a storm.

Hey!

Don't worry.

I'll get us out of here.

(WOOD CREAKING)
What time is it?

It's 9:30.

The sun's gonna rise soon.

(THUNDER CRASHING)
(CREATURES SCREAMING, GROWLING)

(THUNDER CRASHING)
PENNY: Jones is... he's here.

No, Scott.
(KNOCKING) Hey!

Scott, stop.
Hey, leave us alone!

PENNY:
Wait. Wait. Where are you going?

Hey! Hey! Get out of here!
Scott. Scott. Hey.

PENNY: Can you help us?
Tell us what's going on.

(THUNDER CRASHING)
SCOTT: What is it?

SCOTT: Holy shit.

What the fuck is that?

SCOTT: Are you okay?

What? What? What?

What are you looking at?
What are you... what do you see?

Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
(BANGING ON DOOR)

Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

What do we do? What do I do?

Open the door. Open the door.
What?

Open the door. Just open it.
What? Just take it.

Open the door! Open the door!
Take it. Take it.

(POUNDING CONTINUES)

PENNY: Scott!

Where is he? Scott!

Scott.

What happened? Scott.

Scott?
I don't know.

PENNY: Oh, my God!

(SCOTT SCREAMS)

Penny!


(STATIC CRACKLING)

SCOTT'S VOICE: I don't know how
long this night has lasted.

Hours?

Days?

My mind's getting cloudy.

There's some...

there's something in the woods.

It... it does something
to your... your head.

I can feel things

inside.

I can feel things watching
me from inside my own...

PENNY:
Where's the other flashlight?

SCOTT'S VOICE: It's in my backpack.

Scott, what is this?

SCOTT: Just something I
took from the basement.

Why did you take it?

I don't know.

PENNY: You need to take it back.

SCOTT: I can't go back down there.

(WOOD CREAKING)
(QUIET KNOCKING)

(STATIC CRACKLING)

(STATIC CONTINUES CRACKLING)

PENNY: Scott.

What is this?

Scott.

Did you shoot this?

SCOTT: No.

PENNY'S VOICE: Create a book.

Um...

We gotta explore that basement.

Well, I mean, we can keep
trying to talk to him.

I just keep having this dream.

I'm just...

I'm gonna go to sleep.

Okay?

No, Scott.

I left my job, my friends.

You promised me that you
would be responsible.

I just keep having this dream.

ASSAF: To see the world
from another's eyes,

to be in a nightmare

and never to be able to wake up...
that kind of fun stuff.

PENNY: You should start
interviewing some of these guys.

SCOTT: Yeah, yeah. I think it's good.
PENNY: Yeah?

SCOTT:
I just keep having this dream.

I can't really...

(SCOTT MOANS)

It's so vivid. I wake up...

in this blue room.

And I'm watching myself sleep.

PENNY: Why did you take it?

I don't know.

SCOTT: Where's that coming from?
Where is it?

(ECHOING ON MONITOR)

Where's that coming from?
(ECHOING ON MONITOR)

Where's the camera?
(ECHOING ON MONITOR)

Penny, where's the camera?

(THUNDER CRASHES)

SCOTT: Listen. Listen. Listen.
PENNY: No! We're not safe here!

No, we're not safe out there.
We have to leave now.

SCOTT: Listen to me.
Scott.

SCOTT: He's not helping.

PENNY: He helped me out
of the woods twice.

SCOTT:
What do you think he's doing now?

PENNY: We can't.
What, are we gonna stay here?

We're gonna stay here
and be slaughtered?

SCOTT: Yes.

Penny. Penny, stop. Stop.

Turn around and talk to me.
Come on. Penny.

Oh, my God.
I know what they're doing.

What? What the hell are
you talking about?

The birds. They're trying to get
away from what's out there.

(FEMALE VOICE WHISPERING)
She's lying.

The dream world, the nightmare
world... can't you feel it?

Everything is loose, dreamlike.
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!

You're not making any sense!
Can't you feel it?

(LOUD BANG)
(PENNY SCREAMS)

(LOUD BANGING)

What is it?

Mr. Jones was keeping it out.

He was doing just fine and
then we messed it up.

For all we know,
Jones is doing this.

Didn't you see what
happened to him?

What we did to the scarecrows

and then when you went in the
basement and took his stuff.

You're just making a wild guess.

Jones is gone.

Scott.

So who's gonna protect us now?

Huh?

(THUNDER CRASHING)
(RAPID BANGING)

Stop!

(BANGING STOPS)
(THUNDER CRASHING)

(CREATURE SNORTING)

(CREATURE HUFFING)

Scott, don't open that door.

Don't, Scott.

Oh, my God.

(THUNDER CRASHING)

PENNY: Shut the door!




(DOOR SLAMS)
(SCOTT PANTING)

Go to the bedroom. Get the mask.

Get the doll.
Put them in the backpack.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
Ah!

(INSECTS CHIRPING)

(VOICES WHISPERING)



Penny.

Open up.

Open up, please.

(DOOR CREAKING)

Shh.


(LOUD BANG)

Scott. Scott.

We have to get out of here.

Scott, the other world...
it's coming over us.

It's time to wake up, sleepyhead.

This is not the room where you
told me you cut your face.

Scott, this is really...
this is really happening.

This is real.


Wake up!

Scott, don't look at the other ones.
No. No, please.

You're stuck in a nightmare.
Look at me.

The thing you took from
Jones' basement...

Scott, Scott, look at me.

It was important, okay?
Scott, Scott, I'm right here.

Wake up, Mr. Jones.

Scott.

We have to get out of this house.

And we've gotta go
through the woods.

We have to go in the woods.
We have to go in the woods, okay?

Scott. I know. I know.

I know. We have to go in the woods.

I don't want to go in the woods!
(BANGING)

(THUNDER CRASHING)

(BANGING STOPS)

(SCOTT PANTING)

PENNY:
Okay, come on. Come on. Go, go, go!

Run!

Penny, this way.

Penny. Penny.

Penny.

Penny.

Oh, shit.

PENNY: Scott.
Penny?

PENNY:
You have to go in his basement.

You've got to go back down there.


You have to put on the mask.

You need to put back
what you stole.

Penny?
Scott, we have to take it back.

Scott, don't look at her.

Don't look at her. She's not Penny.

Scott, come here.
No, no, no, look at me.

Stay with me, okay?
Don't go near her.

back what you stole.

(SCOTT BREATHING HEAVILY)

PENNY'S VOICE: She's lying.

She's lying.
She's not the real Penny.

I never came back to
the house. Scott.

Scott.

Do not put on the mask.
Do not go back down there.

(PENNY'S VOICE ECHOING)
You have to put on the mask.

You have to put on the mask.

Jones...

Jones unleashed the nightmare.

She's trying to trick you
to destroy the scarecrows.

Do not put it back.

(BANGING ON DOOR)

Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

(BANGING CONTINUES)

(BANGING STOPS)
(GROANS)

(PENNY WHISPERING) Scott.


Scott, help me.

Scott. Scott.

Please help me. Scott.
Help me, Scott.


She's got me.


(DIRT CRUMBLING)

SCOTT: This place is huge.

There's these torches here and
these massive scarecrows.

And there's this...
there's this little guy right here.

Oh, man. I wish you could see this.

Oh, man.

(VOICES WHISPERING)

(MAN BREATHING HEAVILY)

(LIGHTER CLICKS)

They thought the dream
world was real,

not some meaningless neurological
side effect of sleep.

PENNY: Jones is gone, Scott.

So who's gonna protect us now?

There was the waking
world of order,

cause and effect, time and space.

You have to put on the mask.

And another, a very real world
that you glimpsed in dreams.

Wake up, Mr. Jones.

ASSAF: These talismans were
created by the holy men

to patrol the borders of these
two worlds as they overlapped.

(PENNY WHISPERS) It's your turn.

You have to stay behind, Scott.

ASSAF:
To keep the chaos and insanity

and nightmares of the dream
world from entering our own.

SCOTT:
So why do you think he did it?

ASSAF:
Maybe he thought he was a shaman,

warding off evil spirits,

protecting this world
from destruction.

PENNY: You have to put on the mask.

(METAL CLINKS)

PENNY:
You have to protect us, Scott.
