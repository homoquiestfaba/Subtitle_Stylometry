Mom? Dad?

Nick?

â™ªâ™ª


â™ªâ™ª


Grace!

â™ªâ™ª

Grace. Unlock the door.

Sweetie, what's wrong?

â™ªâ™ª

Jesus!

What are you doing, Jake?

I'm gonna break it down.

Give me the bat, son.

You're the worst player
on the team.


[Door opens, creaks]

â™ªâ™ª


Oh, it smells, like, so bad.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[Demonic voice] Grace has
been taken.

She must be sleep-talking.

You should not have inhabited
this house.

It belongs to Deominous.

-Oh, come on.
She's full of shit.

I mean, really.
A demon named Deominous?

Shut up, Jake.
Shut up, Jake.

Yeah, shut up, Jake.

Shut up, Jake. Shut up, Jake.

Aah!
[Laughs]

Okay.

Deominous, listen.

My wife and I... This is Tammy.

Hi.
Deominous knows who you are.

Right.

Tammy and I, we spent
a lot of money on this house.

See, she's a decorator,
and I'm a real estate agent,

Ken Sellers...
And I'll sell your house!

Anyway, we wanted this house
to be special for our kids.

Yeah, right.

And the problem is,

we don't really want to move out
because of you.

So is there some way for Grace
to hop on back into her own body

and you can move
into the guest room?

What?
Well, the basement.

You can live in the basement.

No!

Alright,
well, what do you want from us?

Human sacrifice.

Uh...

What if we... we found you
another sacrifice?

A-A bigger one!

No money down.
Ken!

[Growling softly]

Could... Could we have Grace
back then?

And our house?

â™ªâ™ª

Grace?
Honey!

Grace.

[Normal voice] What's going on?

Mom and Dad made a deal
with a demon for your soul back.

Now we have to find
someone else to sacrifice.

And good luck with that.

Who's desperate enough to move
into a house with a demon?

Hi. I'm Will. I'm here to help.

Oh, well, Presto Paste
is sorry to hear

that you think the new recipe
is too salty.

But we now have
more sodium bicarbonate

than any major brand,

increasing the overall whitening
impact by half... a percent,

which is actually
a pretty big deal

in the toothpaste community.

Yes, the forums are going crazy.

[Indistinct talking over phone]

Hi.

Hey, you look nice.

Smell good.

Hey, Amy,

listen, I'm really sorry
I wasn't there tonight.

It's just, you know,
I had the shift

and people brush their teeth
at night, and if they're like,

"Hey, something tastes weird
with my toothpaste.

I need to talk to someone now!"
you know, they have me.

What's in that?
It's cake batter.

Oh, you're making a cake
at 1:00 in the morning.

Mmm. No, no, no.

Cake pops.

Ohh!
Yeah.

I wanted to surprise you,

you know, celebrate your...
Your big promotion.

It was a promotion, right?

Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.

But you could've just come
to the dinner with me.

You didn't have to do all this.

...four decades.

I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.

I didn't realize you've been
a Presto Paste customer

for 40 years.

No, I haven't stuck
with anything

for more than a few months.

Five years. I mean, five years.

Hey, where are you going?

No, really, Amy, I am sorry.

I just thought you had your
coworkers and cool work friends

and job and promotion,
so I just...

Okay. I get it.

Well, that's for you.

Will, you're making cake pops
in the middle of the night

and answering
customer service calls.

Well, I thought you...
I thought you liked my job

because we get free toothpaste.

-The toothpaste is terrible.
We don't even use it.

Well, I'm, uh, I'm not gonna
work there for forever.

Yes, I am.
Keep going. It's okay.

And what do you want to do
forever, then?

Because you can't
quit Presto Paste

because you can't commit
to doing anything else.

That's not true.

Oh, yeah, I am. I'm still here.

No, no. You don't need
to speak with a supervisor.

O-kay.

What happened
to your woodworking business?

Well, yeah, that was cool
for a while

until, you know, I saw online
it's more economical

to make and sell
your own candles.

You loved those candles.

Yeah, remember? Seaside musk.

Or no.

Nah, I remember now.

You did not like the candles.
Yeah.

Yes, I know.
No, keep... go on, go on.

Just wait a second.
Wait. This is, um...

The exercise tapes.

I got those
from the garage sale, remember?

Even if I haven't exactly
used them... yet.

Uh, but the woodworking.

I am almost halfway done
with this dresser for you.

And it's got character.

But it'll get done.

Will.

I don't want you to give me
an excuse.

Or a hobby.

Or a cake pop.

â™ªâ™ª

Why didn't you
come with me tonight?

â™ªâ™ª

I need to know if this means
as much to you as it does to me.

I want a refund. Hello?

Sorry, just let me finish.

Yes, if you mail in
your comment card

Presto Paste
would be... would be happy to...

To refund you on that purchase.

Uh-huh.

Yes, and do fill out
that survey after.

Okay, thank you.
Okay. Alright, bye-bye.

No. Amy. Wait, hey.

â™ªâ™ª

Idiot.

You know, your, uh, your ad
didn't mention

It's the whole house, my friend.


[Knocking rhythmically]

[Whooshing, clanging]

New pipes, still settling in.

Uh, I don't know...
if I need a whole house.

You know what?
Yeah, this might've been

a little premature, actually,
and I shouldn't

have wasted...
Wait. Whoa, there. [Laughs]

You didn't even take a look.

It's a heck of a deal.
Mm-hmm.

What do you say, pal?

You look like a smart
and reliable human host.

Don't you think so, Tammy?


[Laughs]
Oh.

No one's ever called me
that before.

Oh.

Oh.

Wow.

My, uh,
my girlfriend's apartment

was like twice as much

and didn't come with furniture,
like this place.

Well, I didn't have time
to clear out most

of the furniture that came
with the estate, but, um...

Hm.
...did you...

Did you say girlfriend?

[Whimsical tune plays]

Ex-girlfriend, I guess.

Oh.
Yeah.

But I don't know.
I mean, what do you guys think?

Should... Should I see
if we can work things out?

I mean, love always wins, right?

It sounds like
you both need space.

Take the time to learn
who youare

before you could be together.

Ken's right.

And, while you're here,

are there any other relatives

or friends
who might look for you?

No.
Oh.

But, you know,
I should probably, um,

check it all out, right,
before I commit to anything.

Amy always said
I hate to commit.

And maybe now is the time
to change that, huh, buddy?

Yeah.

Have a look.

â™ªâ™ª

Uh!

So, what do you think?

Interested?

This used to be Grace's room.

But it can be whatever you want.

Guest room.

Home office.

Woodworking shop?

Sure, if you want.

Well, if this is your room,
then,

this must be yours, too.

Oh, she... she found it here
when we moved in,

but she doesn't want it anymore.

Oh, okay.

I'll take it, then.

Ah.

Along with the house.

Great.

That's wonderful.

Bye.

â™ªâ™ª


That...

...is a cool chair!

Yes, I remember you
from last week.

Good, because I want
some answers.

First off, they still
have to change

the recipe.
I'm sorry, but the-there's

a lot of people that don't think

the new recipe
is actually too salty.

[Singing on radio] - Yeah, sure.
Okay, look,

maybe if you just gave
the new recipe a...

A chance to figure itself out

before... before you just

end your relationship with it
altogether,

you wouldn't break its heart

and you wouldn't suck
its soul out and suffocate it

and leave it just one hollow,
empty...

tube.

Just transfer me.

Yeah, I can transfer you
to someone else.

No, that's fine because
the new recipe has, uh,

better stuff to do tonight,
anyways, so...

Really?
...yeah, that works out.

â™ª Down here where you belong â™ª


Hi. I'm Will,
and I'm here to help.

-Okay, he's not dead.

That's a positive thing
for me to know.

Hey, Patrick.

I told you,
I don't really want to

talk to anyone right now,
and this is my work phone

and I know

you know that. And,
if you have a question about

Presto Paste, I can't help you.

Okay. You know that stuff
sucks, right?

It... It tastes like a...
Like a friggin' butt.

Well, I'm sorry to hear
about your experience, sir.

I-I-I personally don't really
care for your tone.

And the active ingredient
is called sodium bicarbonate

and I think it...
It rocks, actually,

so, good night. [Beep]

[Ringtone plays]

Hi, this is Will.

Who is this?

I just want to make sure

that you haven't

done anything stupid.

You haven't tried to call

Amy, have you?

No!
Okay.

Or, well, once.

Oh!
Oh, I left her

a voicemail, and I might've
been crying.

Will, you have to be prepared

that you might not get her back.

I-I know.

I-I know that.

I don't think you do.

You know, she thinks I'm

stalling... [Scoff]

...but it's kind of hard
to figure out your whole life

all of a sudden, you know?

[Radio continues playing]

We're supposed to be a team.

Well, are you?

No. She, uh, dumped me.

Stalling. Are you stalling?

No... man.

You do

that weird voice when you're

being deceptive.
No... I don't!

There it is again.

Agh! I don't have
to listen to you!

You're not my dad!

Even though you're

a boring lawyer guy,

like my dad.
Okay.

Your dad is a tax attorney

and one of my personal
heroes, so,

thank you for the compliment,
actually.

Wow.
I'm just worried about you.

I don't think you're
in a good headspace right now

and you need a friend.

Uh...

my headset's gone.
Okay.

-Yeah, that's good.
You got to unplug sometimes.

No, it... it was here,
and now it's, like...

It's completely gone.
I... I gotta go.

And I'm not stalling.

I worked on the dresser today
and exercised.

And you can tell Amy that.

I'm really trying here, Patrick.

I am. So could you just
tell her that, please?

Will...
Oh, my God. Fine. Don't.

I don't care.

Soul's too weak.

Shh!
Do nothing.

-He's coming.
We'll do what he wants.

But he doesn't want him.

He won't take him.
Yes, he will.


[Dance music blasts] Son of a...

Oh.

It's just a creaky house.

Okay?

Hmm.

â™ªâ™ª

Are you sure you weren't drunk
when you did that?

No, no. I would never bake
a cake with the icing on it.

It would melt.
Look, I...

I know that you're trying
to prove yourself

or find yourself or something.

I-I just don't think it's
a good idea for you to be...

Will, what are you doing?! God!

Doesn't taste
like one of my cakes, either.

That could have poison in it!

Or human blood or something.

You just don't like cake.
I like cake.

It's just sugar rots your mouth,

and I don't know why you'd want
to do that to your body.

I'm... I'm calling the cops.

No, don't ca... It's fine.

What are you gonna say?
A yummy, scary cake

just showed up in the kitchen?

Yeah.
What if it's...

What if it's Amy saying
she wants to get back together?

You think that Amy
broke into your house

and wrote, "I will
have your soul" on a cake?

I think it's romantic.

Oh, my God, Will. Come on!

[Siren wails]

Well, thanks again for these,

but you absolutely should
not have called us.

But there's, um...
Yeah, the only

unusual activity
is the impressive amount

of cakes you've made.

But if you call us again

and it's not a serious
emergency, you will be fined.

Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

[Door opens] This is insane.

Someone clearly broke in.

Let's just... Let's call Amy,

let her explain.
Amy didn't make the cake.

Okay. But she's the only other
person that knows I'm here

besides you, you know?
And I know Amy.

Except she dumped you.

â™ªâ™ª

Sorry, but... I just...

No, don't you have
a boring day job to get to?

Hey! Hey.

Were you about to break

-Uh, I...
[Tires screech in distance]

...needed to tell you something,
and you didn't answer,

so I thought
you were in trouble.

What... What's the emergency?

Um...

You... You left your, uh,
quarter with... with my stuff.

Yeah, I just thought
you might need it

if, um, you need to do laundry

or buy a soda

or play... pinball.

That's not an emergency.

Mm.

Totally.

Uh...

Will, this is Nick.

Hey.
Right.

I'll be going then,
and I'll, uh...

I'll see you around.

Unless I die.

Or u-unless he dies.

Will?
Yeah.

Are you okay?
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm good.

I, uh... I'm good.
I'm just gonna go home

to my normal house

I was having until you two

â™ªâ™ª

Hey. Uh, so, yeah,
I think I'm just gonna

stay here for a while.

Will is not welcome here!

Apparently, I'm not welcome
anywhere else,

so we're gonna
have to figure it out!

Okay.

I'm gonna go to my room now.


Yep.

Ohh!

â™ªâ™ª

So you're just gonna
stand there?

â™ªâ™ª

I want my shirt back.

â™ªâ™ª

You know, you're, uh...

You're lucky to be a ghost.

So then you can't fall in love
and be dumped for Nick.

Who's named Nick anyway?

It's... It's weird, right?

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Ohh!

Fine! It's not weird.

He's probably really cool.

Just leave me alone.

â™ªâ™ª

I hate you.

â™ªâ™ª

...with over 172 properties

I'm Tim Sellers,
and I will sell your...

Sorry I wasn't who you needed.

I know it's too late now

for you to see
that I'm better than I was.

It wasn't your fault.

You were just
figuring things out.

Maybe we can... try again?

Yeah.
Maybe we can...

â™ªâ™ª

...start over...

No, no!

It's too late.

You have Nick now.
Oh, stupid Nick.

-Forget Nick.
What we had, it was real.

We're connected.

We're meant to end up together.

We're... soul mates.

No!

-I don't deserve you, Amy.
We both know it.

â™ªâ™ª

I'm just a 27-year-old loser

with a minimum-wage
customer-service job,

living in someone else's house
with someone else's demons.

Hey.
Maybe you're right...

Will.

Maybe you have
no purpose in life after all.

Shut up.
And now that I'm gone, too,

how do you even live
with yourself?

[Growls]
Aah!

Fine. You can watch TV.

I don't care.

Oh!



Oh, God.

â™ªâ™ª

[Plastic rustling]

You know what?
I don't have to shower.



â™ªâ™ª

Hey. [Clatters]

Huh?

I'm not gonna hurt you.

No surprises. [Chuckles]

Aha!

Aah! What?

[Speaking Latin]

â™ªâ™ª

What?

I... I don't understand.

You must leave.

Will is not the sacrifice
Deominous desires.


Well, why not? Hmm?

Hey, why don't you
ask this Deominous guy

just what's so wrong with me?
I'm right here.

Here I am! Take my soul.

I don't need it.


Um, I'm not here 'cause
I needed you or something.

I just had to, uh, get
out of the house for a while.

Of course you did. You needed
some human interaction.

As opposed to the alternative?

Yeah.

What's, uh, the alternative?

Let's just say that I am tired
of certain demons

sitting on their high horses,
telling me I'm not good enough.

Yeah, uh, we all need to listen

to our inner demons sometimes,
Will.

That's our conscience
telling us that we need

to pay attention
to our well-being.

Hmm.

Or when we need
to start moving on.

Hey.

No. What is going on?
It's good for you.

Are you setting me up?
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

Hey!
Hi!

How's it going?
Good, good.

There you go.
Oh, thank you.

Will, this is Aimee, from work.

Hi.

Hi.
Amy is spelled with two E's.

And an I.

So it's totally different.

Than the conventional spelling.

Um, Patrick here has told me

so many wonderful things
about you.

He said that... that you two
have been friends

since you were kids...
Mm.

...which is pretty cute.
Yeah.

Well, maybe.
Just a couple of kids.

-Yeah.
[Both laugh]

-Ha.

You know, craziest thing
about Patrick

is he got a cavity once.

-It wasn't just a cavity.
The dentist said that my tooth

was so rotten
that I could have died.

Wow. Um... yeah.

And it's also when you stopped
eating sugar and cake.

And it's also when
you kind of stopped being fun.

Can you just be normal
for 5 seconds

in front of Aimee, please?
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry

that I'm not being normal
like Patrick.

Aimee... Am I pronouncing
that right, by the way?

It's just Aimee.
Hmm.

Well, there are...
There are two E's.

There are.
Oh, God.

You know what? I actually...

I have a really big
accounting meeting

kind of early in the morning,
so...

That sounds interesting,
doesn't it, Will?

Um...
Yeah, it's not actually

that exciting.

It's just we had
a minor security breach, so...

Oh. Will actually just had
a pretty scary break-in.

Why don't you
tell her about that

and, uh. how you were all alone
in this big house, and it's...

Haunted. It's super haunted.

-[Laughs uneasily]
Come on, Will.

Tell her the real story.

That's the real...
That's the real story.

Oh, shit.
It's super haunted.

Ghosts... everywhere.

I can't go anywhere.
I have nowhere to go

because Amy... Oh, sorry.

That's my ex-girlfriend.

And I bet you Patrick
didn't want to bring her up

because he thought
I'd be weird about it,

but I don't think
I'm being weird, you know?

Am I being weird?

No, no, no! It's... It's fine.
Yeah, I don't think...

It's fine.
Yeah.

Mm.

There's no alcohol in that,

but I don't have anywhere else
to go because Amy dumped me.

Hmm.

And I can't live with Patrick
because,

unlike me, he has a life.

Okay. Just because I have
a steady income and a mortgage

and I do Taekwondo
on Mondays and Thursdays...

Oldest in the class...
Oh! [Chuckles]

doesn't mean I have a life.

The worst part is,

the ghosts,
they don't want my soul.

They must have
tried it on and said,

"This one sucks," you know?


Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

It's okay, it's okay.
Uh, I'm sure that any ghost

would be lucky
to have your soul.

Right?
I mean, they just don't know

what they're missing out on.

Really?
Yeah.

Thank you. Thank you, Aimee.

That's really nice.
I'm sorry.

I didn't know
anything about... that.

It's okay. Um...

Yeah. Actually, in college,

I used to cleanse houses
of all sorts of...

spirits and negative energies
and stuff.

Really?
Really?

Aimee, now, listen,
I need a cleansing.

I need it tonight
because I don't know

how much longer I can take this.

Please. Can you help me?

â™ªâ™ª

Help me, please.

Please.

Okay. This is it.

Sometimes they, uh,
start being annoying

around 3:15 in the morning,

but other days, they
just kind of start whenever.

There are no ghosts.


Oh, I'm definitely
sensing something.

Um...
Is it that ghost boy?

He's really starting
to piss me off.

Mm. It's coming from
the basement.

Ooh, yeah
He likes to hide in there.

Yeah. Okay. And...

Is there a girl's room?
Is there a little girl?

Yeah,
there was a little girl, yes.

O-Okay. Yeah, sure.

There was a little girl
that lived here.

That's a great guess.
But there are no ghosts.

Mm.

If you're not gonna help,
just go home, okay?

'Cause I'm tired of these ghosts
jumping out of nowhere

and demanding sacrifices

and playing piano
better than me. Okay?

I'm gonna end it.

Or, well, Aimee is gonna end it.

Yeah. Right?

Yeah.
Yes. Good.

Yeah. Okay.

Do you have any sage? Or salt.

I'm gonna need sage and salt.

Yeah. I... Well, I do.

I was gonna use those
for some scones tomorrow...

Stalling.
I'm not stalling. Shut up.

No. Okay. We are gonna do

the cleansing
in the girl's room.

I need you to get the sage
and the salt.

Yes.

So, are you gonna use
all of that, or...?

It's cool. I can get more.

Okay, good.

Uh, what... what kind is it?

No, no.
So, Aimee...

how did you learn
how to do cleansings, exactly?

My roommate in college
was really into crystals

and palm readings,
and, I mean, it paid the bills.

So, why do you work
with Patrick, then,

if you can make money
doing really cool ghost stuff?

Uh, we lost control
during a seance,

and that's when I decided to...

take a more conventional path
with my life.

Oh.

What happens
when you lose control?

Well, spirits take over
the house, wreak havoc.

Oh.
That's not so bad.

I mean, my spirits
are doing that anyways.

They will burn demonic symbols
into your flesh,

curse you, blind you,
possess you,

turn you against
your loved ones.

Yeah, it can get pretty dark.

I promised myself
that I would never do it again.

Then, uh, what are we doing
right now, exactly?

Oh, no, this isn't a seance.

This is just a cleansing.
Totally safe.

Okay?
Yeah, totally.

Hey, uh, Will, just one second?

What?
Hey, uh...

remember what I said
about inner demons, Will?

You can't hide
from them forever.

And now you're trying to get
Aimee from accounting into this.

She's the only other person
at work who likes

that weird deli by the office.
Okay?

I can't lose my lunch, buddy.
I can't.

-Okay, okay.
Hey, if you like her so much,

why don't you ask her out?

[Clears throat]

Come on.

Hold my hand.

O-o-o-o-oh, spirits!

Oh, God.

You must release yourself

from the confines of this house.

You are not welcome.

Mm.

Yay! You did it.
I think they're gone.

Let's go back to the bar
to celebrate.

Oh, no, no. Unh-unh.

The spirits have heard me,
but they haven't left yet.

O-o-o-o-oh, spirits.
[Distant banging]

You are no longer of this world.

You must release yourself
from the confines

of this earthly home.

It belongs to Will...

server of toothpaste customers.

Baker of baked goods.

And...

You know,
I'm actually still kind of

trying to figure that out.
We can... We can skip this part.

But thank you.
You're doing great.

Okay. Anyway, spirits,
it belongs to the living,

and I cast you out!

[Wind howling]

Uh...

There's gotta
be a window open or...

something. I'll go close it.

[Demonic growl]

There's a demon in this house.

My cleansing was for...

It was for ghosts.

Like, the spirits
haven't moved on.

How different can it be,
you know?


Whoa! Oh! Aimee! Aimee? Aimee?

Uh... be okay.

[Breathing heavily] Patrick!

Uh, okay. Don't move.

Stay right here. I'll be back.

â™ªâ™ª


Patrick?

[Tapping continues]

â™ªâ™ª

[Door opens]

[Tapping continues]

Patrick?

Aimee's passed out
in the other room.

We gotta go. We got to get her
to a hospital, like, now.

[Demonic growls]

You know, Deominous
wanted Will to leave.

But Will didn't listen.

Will brought his friends.

Friends Deominous could possess.

Deominous, seriously,
Patrick is a nerd.

You don't want him.

Deominous likes nerds!

-Hey!
[Door rattles]

Deominous, open the door!

â™ªâ™ª

Patrick?!

Patrick?

[Demonic growling]

[Doorknob rattles]

Come on!


Not this time, ghost.

Unh!

[Body thuds]



I hate those stairs.


Patrick?

Or Deominous?

[Demonic growling]

Patrick...

your best human friend.

Okay, Patrick.

Aimee needs our help, okay?
We gotta get her out of here.

And you're the responsible one,
remember?

You're the one always telling me

to do the right thing
over the easy thing.

I don't think I want
to do that any more.

I think I want
to let the lady suffer.

Hang out with Deominous instead.

That sounds fun.

It... Yeah, that...

I think that could be...
All right.

Yeah, we'll just do that.

No, we're not gonna do that!

[Both grunt]

Get off me! [Grunts]

You smell really bad.

-And you are weak.
Patrick works out.

I know!

No, no! Please, please, please!

Please, don't! No, no...

[Bone cracks] Aah!

[Laughs]

Your brittle bones
are no match for Deominous.

Aah!


Patrick? [Door opens]

-Hey, demon!
You're not of this world.

You must release your essence
from the confines of the living!

Patrick!

I cast you out!
Unh!

[Breathing heavily]

Nice.
See that?

That's how you cast out a demon.

[Breathing heavily]

It's totally different.

You okay?

Good.

I'm gonna sit down.

[Bone cracks]

Ohh.

â™ªâ™ª

We're gonna go to the hospital,
and you're gonna come back

and live with me for a while.
What?

Aimee fixed it. She... saved us.

I'm not gonna live with you.

You're not saying you want
to come back and live here?

You know, you... you and Amy
have been on my case for years

about what I'm supposed to do
with my life.

This might be it.

What is "it," exactly?

Guard the world from demons
and... and stay here

and keep him from, you know,
getting out of the house.

Are you listening to yourself?

Guys, stop!

This is really
dangerous territory.

I don't know how strong
that demon is.

It could come right back.

Well, then I'll just

cast it out again, you know?

Like you did.
Like, "Begone, demon!

Get out of my house!"

It's paraphrasing,
but it's pretty spot on, right?

No, what I'm saying, Will,
is that it could come back

and it could
try to kill someone.

That demon is looking
for a sacrifice to take to Hell.

Oh, well, doesn't want me.

And no one's gonna be here
except me.

Okay. So you're just gonna
avoid everyone else forever?

That's your big life plan?

Yeah, Patrick, that's the plan.

As long as that nice family
let me stay here, sure.

Why not? I mean, what else
do I have going on for me?

â™ªâ™ª

Okay.

Just come to the hospital
with us,

and then, you can do
whatever you want.

I'm not gonna stop you.
But, dude,

I can see the bone sticking
out of your arm right now.


â™ªâ™ª

Okay. You good?

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Amy?

Hey.

Hey.

What are you doing?
This is weird.

I'm like... holding a rock,
and you're broken.


Oh. I don't know
if I would say it like that.

No, I meant your arm is broken.

Yeah. Oh, yeah.

So it's true.

What did you hear?

Patrick just told me
that you were in an accident

and that you're in the hospital.

Yeah.
I tried to call you,

but, um, you didn't answer,
and I...

Well, I just...

Could I come inside?

Sure. Sure. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

Uh...

[Keys rattle]

Um...

I'm sorry.

Actually, I don't know
if it's a good idea.

Yeah, right.

Well, I'm glad that you're okay.

Thanks for... for coming.
Yeah.

Okay.

Cast out...



[Breathes deeply]

Let's open this house.

[Keys rattle]

[Pills rattle] Oh, my God.

Hey. Oh.

Uh... [Chuckles]

I'm sorry.
I was... I was gonna get it.

It's just, the cast is, um...

I'm still figuring it out.
Right.

Thank you.
You're welcome. Here.

[Keys rattle]

-Uh, wait, Amy.
I'm sorry. It's...

It's too... It's too dangerous.

Just... Just relax, okay?

I'm just here
to check on you... as a friend.

â™ªâ™ª

[Lock clicks, door opens]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

So...

â™ªâ™ª

So...

â™ªâ™ª

So, how's Nick?

â™ªâ™ª

Oh, um...

Yeah, we went out
a couple times.

You're in love. It's okay.
No, no, no.

Um... [Chuckles]

It was fine. I just... I...

I didn't really feel it,
you know?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

That's how it goes sometimes.


â™ªâ™ª

Have you been seeing anyone?

Seeing, like, dating
or, like, spirits?

Dating is what you meant.
No. Nope.

Are you okay?
What?

Are you on painkillers?
What?

-[Laughs]
No. I mean, yes, a little,

but I'm... I'm good.

Nothing's wrong, uh,
and everything is fine.

â™ªâ™ª

Okay.

Well, then...
I should probably go

since you're not in trouble...
Oh.

...or anything.
Uh, wait.

Hey, Amy, wait.

Um, m-maybe...

â™ªâ™ª

You know, since we appeared
to actually be alone...

â™ªâ™ª

If you wanted to stay,

I'm making some really
good spaghetti tonight.

â™ªâ™ª

If that interests you.

â™ªâ™ª

[Foreign Slippers' "Old Ghosts"
plays]

â™ª So it's happened

â™ª The walls are coming down

Gotta bash that.
Yeah, go for it.

I'll just peel this guy.

I'll peel, you bash. Go.

Ooh!
Satisfying.

It was a nice crunch.
Thank you.

Mm. It's kind of, eh...

I don't know.

Garlic?
Yeah.

-Oh. There you go.
There you go, yeah.

â™ª Nothin' left to say

Ah.
Okay. Just take more time.

That's fine. What are you doing?

Get it? Yay!

Definitely needs more time.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª This is the start
of something great â™ª

You can't dance.
I can dance.

You can't dance.
I dance.

â™ª When I bid farewell
to the old ghost â™ª

â™ª We're on the, we're on the,
we're on the right track here â™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª We're on the right track

â™ª We're on the right track

â™ª We're on the right track

â™ª We're on the right track

â™ª We're on the right track

â™ª We're on the right track

â™ª We're on the right track

â™ªâ™ª

[Ominous music plays]

â™ªâ™ª

How's the sauce?

I'll check on it now.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª We're on the right track

â™ª We're on the right track

Um... yeah.

It's, um...

Yeah, it's a lot better.

Maybe we can... try again?

Maybe we can start over,
Charlie.

â™ªâ™ª

-It's too late now.
You have Rick.

Forget Rick.

What we had is real.
We're connected.

We're meant to end up together.

We're soul mates.

[Clock ticking]

Can I ask you something?
Yeah, s-sure.

You can ask me...
You can ask me anything.

Why didn't you go with me?

The night we... broke up.

You just never told me,
and I just...

I need closure.

[Clock ticking]

Closure. Right.

It's just...

I thought you were
my best friend,

and I thought
you would be happy for me.

I was. I-I am.

I am. Um...

And if closure is
what would make you... happy...

Then...

What are you doing?
Okay. Imagine this.

We've just bumped
into each other on the street

and stopped for
a dramatic moment of realization

that we haven't seen each other
in, like, a while.

It's like years...
Time has passed, right?

You know, I've been...
I've been doing things,

been working on stuff,
finishing up some projects.

That part actually is true,
by the way.

But anyways, I'd stop,
and I'd see you,

and I'd say, "Amy, is that you?"

-Seriously?
You'd forget what I look like?

[Both laugh]
Well, no, it's be...

Because I'm... I'm on my way

to a very important meeting

for my super profitable
candlemaking, woodworking,

cake-making business
that I've just been,

you know, just fully
committed to.

Will, please tell me

you threw away
those disgusting candles.

They're so bad.

-I did not.
[Both laugh]

I still have them all.

But, no, then you'd say,

"Will...

have you been working out?"

And I would say, "Yeah.

Just ran a marathon
this morning."

A whole marathon?
Yeah, a whole marathon.

You know, because it's just
very important to me

that I impress you

with the things that future me

will do but hasn't done yet.

Okay, I know
what I would say next.

"Oh, Will! Is that you?"

Dang.

You forgot
what I looked like, too.

"I didn't see you
over my grand opening

for my brand-new business
and my Nobel Prize

for solving global warming
with the new flavor of ice cream

I created."

How exactly does that work?
So, it's ice cream.

Mm-hmm.
It recools the Earth.

New flavor of ice cream?
Mm-hmm.

And you won a Nobel Prize.
Mm-hmm.

Your stuff's
way cooler than mine.

-You forgot about my business.
It's okay.

Oh. No, I...
I didn't forget about that.

You're actually gonna do that.

â™ªâ™ª

That was supposed
to make you feel better.

Um...

Supposed to make you feel happy.

I'm... I'm sorry
if I messed it up.

Well, I want you
to be happy, too.

And if you're happy here...

with all of your hobbies,

then I am glad.

I really am.

â™ªâ™ª

I'm... I'm not happy.

â™ªâ™ª

I'm not happy at all.

â™ªâ™ª

Except right now.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª


What's wrong?
Oh. Nothing.

â™ªâ™ª

[Ominous music plays]

[Clock ticking]

Amy...

the reason Patrick told you
I was in trouble

is because there are...
Or, were...

ghosts... living in the house.

â™ªâ™ª

And a demon.

â™ªâ™ª

Uh, yeah, and I was just gonna,
you know, just stay here

and guard the world
from any returning evil spirits

and whatnot, just because...

I don't know.
I just thought if I was

living alone, I might as well be

doing something productive.

Right?

Yeah, uh...

Anyway, I was just wondering...

I mean, uh, you know,
it's... it's like you...

it's like you said...

you either feel it or you don't.

â™ªâ™ª

And this feels right to me.

â™ªâ™ª

Does it feel right to you, too?


Oh.

Okay.

Amy never loved you.

Amy felt sorry for you.

[Demonic voice] And now Amy...

is mine.

Aah!

No? Okay.

I know, I know. I can do it.

Okay. Hey, demon, I...

You know, it's not cool for you

to take living
people's bodies, man.

And I banish you...
[Growling]

...out of my ex but maybe
future girlfriend Amy.


[Bed creaks]

Amy?

Hey, Amy, are you okay?

That was the worst
demon cleansing

Deominous has ever heard.

And Deominous has been cast
out of a lot of bodies.


Amy?

[Growling]
Come back over here!

Come back over here!

No. No, no! No, no.

Amy, stop it.

[Muffled shouting, crashing
from the house]

[Gear clicks]

[Cellphone rings]

I-I know you told me I can't
miss any more nights,

but I've been going through
a lot, personally, and...

Do you know the procedure?
Yes.

No, I know.
I know the procedure.

Yeah. [Beep]

Sorry. It's, um... It's my boss.

He's just really mad because
I haven't really been on my...

My A game at work lately,

and I promised that
I would work tonight,

and, um, I'm trying
to get out of it.

Raah!
Okay.

I, um... I printed these.

The Internet has
a lot of great tips

about how to exorcise demons.

Raah!
It says to start by drawing

a protective circle.

We're gonna protect up.

Here, watch your feet. Okay.

So, uh, okay.

Draw protective symbols
that represent virtue.

Okay. Here, watch your feet.

What? No... No, please.

No, stop.
You're messing up my...

It's okay.


Oh, something's working.

Oh, I...
Yes. No, I was listening.

No, sir, I wasn't.
Please don't transfer me to H.R.

Please don't...


I'm on hold now. Awesome.


-I made this.
See, demons hate these.

So just, here, take it.
It's okay.

It'll be good. Here, really.

Just take it. It's okay.
In the hand.

Here, just... [Sizzling]

[Screaming]
Sorry! I'm sorry!

Hello? Hi! Help!

I mean, no, hi.
I'm Will. I'm here to help...

[Indistinct speaking]

He's lying. Oh, he's lying.

Yes, I did go off script
the other night a little bit,

but I did not say
that Presto Paste

was the official
toothpaste of Satan.

[Speaking Latin]

What was that?

[Chuckles nervously]

That's the TV. Sorry.
It's the little TV.

Amy will be sacrificed!

Amy will be taken to Hell.

Amy's soul belongs to Deominous.

Well, yeah, that's pretty bad.

But please, um, don't fire me.

This is all I have.

[Bones cracking]

No, please.

[Line clicks]


[Headset thuds]

[Bones cracking]

[Doorbell rings]

Stay.


What?! Are you guys

here to interfere
with my life some more?

Ever since the cleansing,
I've been connected

with the energy here.

I can feel some kind of...
domestic disturbance.

Lost love...
possessed by darkness.

[Muffled growling]

Doesn't sound like
anything going on here.

Is that Amy?
[Growls loudly]

Tied up in the living room?
Oh, my God, Will.

Oh, my God! What did you do?!

We're complicit now.
You realize that, right?

The police are gonna
question us,

and I can't lie to the police,
Will.

You're not in court!

And no one's
going to trial or Hell.

I didn't do anything.
It's all Deominous's fault.

Things were going
so well with Amy.

And then Deominous showed up...
What?!

...and possessed her soul
and ruined everything.

Okay, well,
we have to get in there.

We have to help her.
No. Why, why?

You guys don't... You don't
think I can do this on my own?

You don't think
I can win her back

from Deominous with true love?


Listen,
that whole 3:15 a.m. thing,

that's what a gateway to Hell
can open.

So if Deominous has successfully
possessed someone,

all he has to do
is open that portal

at 3:15 to take them... forever.

â™ªâ™ª

Are you saying Amy's gonna die?

â™ªâ™ª

We don't have a lot of time.

Let's save her together.

Okay?

Yeah.

Okay.



[Clock ticking]

Oh, she...
Oh, God.

-She was just here.
You guys saw her.

Oh, she took my headset.

"Save your loved ones
from the demons of Hell

in three easy steps."

Yeah, it seemed easy enough.

Besides, you guys already
burned all my sage and stuff.

"The first step is to take away
their rock and roll music."

Okay.

Yeah. I said it was easy.

[Electricity crackles]

Amy?

We gotta find her.

â™ªâ™ª

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[Plate shatters]

Is this because you never
liked my pottery?

Whoa!

Okay! Okay!

You can destroy all my hobbies!

We just want Amy's, uh, soul?


Amy's soul is mine.

Come on.

Unh!

I should've told you about that.

Man...

Ugh!
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

I-I knew about that, too.

Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

[Door opens]

-Hello?
[Door closes]

Ghosts?

Demons?

Goblins?

Oh! Uh, hi, Will

I didn't think
you'd still be here.

You knew.

Why didn't you tell me
about Deominous

before I rented your house?

Sorry. We're sorry, okay?

But you were
supposed to be the sacrifice

instead of our sweet Grace.

-Oh, yeah?
Well, the joke's on you

because the demon
didn't even want me.

Nope. He decided to possess
everybody I love instead.

And he's got my ex-girlfriend
in the basement right now!

That doesn't sound like a joke.

Who are these people?
We're his friends.

you didn't have any friends.

Okay, everybody calm down.

Sellers family...

I forgive you for trying
to sacrifice my soul.

Now let's focus
on the task at hand...

Rescuing the love of my life,
Amy.

But I don't want to rescue her.

I want someone to be sacrificed

so we can live
in our house again.

Shh! Shh!

No one's getting sacrificed
tonight, Ken. Got it?

That's not going to happen.

Ohh! Ohh! Hey!


Will!


Just stay there!
We'll figure something out.


I think I gotta do this alone.

Will...

you have to be prepared
that you might not get her back.

I know.

I know.

â™ªâ™ª


â™ªâ™ª

We have to perform a seance.
Right.

I mean, no, absolutely not.

You said that's dangerous.

But Will and Amy are stuck
in that basement,

and the only chance
that they have

is if we can somehow figure out
a way to sever the link

between Deominous
and those spirits.

Please.

Let's do this together. Right?

â™ªâ™ª

[TV turns on]

Okay. Yeah. Cool.

You guys just
hang out or whatever.

We're gonna need a way
to communicate.

Something analog.
Uh, a tape recorder,

candles, cushions...
a spirit board.

Will has those
gross candles upstairs.

-I have cushions.
They're vintage silk.

Tammy, don't engage.

I have a board that can
connect us with the dead.

Why do you need
to talk to ghosts, Jake?

â™ªâ™ª

God, you're so weird.

That just leaves
the tape recorder.

Does this work?

â™ªâ™ª

-Don't give up!
You're doing awesome!

Ugh.

You should feel it
right in your glutes.

Whatever this is, we're gonna
have to tape over it.

[Music stops]

Something smells...
Terrible?

It's the candles...
mixed with demon stench.


Can we just get this over with?

â™ªâ™ª

Oh, spirits...

if you have occupied this house,
if you have terrorized

and annoyed those living here,
we summon you back.

We summon you to face us.

And we'd like to make an appeal
to keep Will and Amy

in the custody of the living.

Please. Thank you.

Your Honor.

â™ªâ™ª



â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª


â™ªâ™ª

[Hisses]
Aah!

Where do you keep coming from?!

Just leave me alone, please!


â™ªâ™ª

[Scraping continues]


â™ªâ™ª

Amy.

Or... Deominous.

You can send as many ghosts
as you want to try to stop me.

They're really scary,

but I'm not
gonna let Amy down this time.

Can you tell her that?

[Bones crack]

â™ªâ™ª

Guess not.

Clearly, you got your own thing

going on with that... hole.

Uh...

But it doesn't matter,
because if you take Amy to Hell,

then I'm coming to hell, too.

Yeah, you're gonna be
stuck with me.

â™ªâ™ª

[Bones crack]

[Wind blows]

â™ªâ™ª

Spirits, are you standing
behind Grace right now?

â™ªâ™ª

No.

Are you in the house?

â™ªâ™ª

Yes.


â™ªâ™ª

We know that Deominous
has used you,

possessed you into doing evil.

We want to help.

How do we banish
Deominous forever

so that you can return
to the afterlife in peace?

â™ªâ™ª

Spirits...

why won't you answer?

â™ªâ™ª

The...

girl.

Something about Grace?

What is it?
What's wrong with her?

Nothing! She's perfect!

De...

ominous...

poss... essed...

two...

living...

souls.

â™ªâ™ª

No. No. He's the woman
in the basement.

He doesn't want Grace.

[Demonic voice] Wrong, Daddy.

[All shout]

Grace!
No! Wait!

[Door slams, lock clicks]

Amy, please,
we're running out of time!

[Growls]
Oh, shit!

â™ªâ™ª

[Screaming]

What was that? It's just...

It's just toothpaste.

[Bone cracks] Ohh, God!


[Clock chiming]

Has your sister been possessed
by Deominous before?

Yeah, but the demon said
he'd let Grace go if...

Wait, wait, wait.

You can't bargain with a demon.

He's gonna take everything.

-That can't be legal.
[Walkman clicks]

Look!

â™ªâ™ª


Spirits, are you standing
behind Grace right now?

Are you in the house?

We know that Deominous
has used you,

possessed you into doing evil.

We want to help.
How do we banish Deominous

forever so that you can return
to the afterlife in peace?

Destroy object.

Demon-made.

Okay! That's why!

That's why they weren't
answering on the board.

It's 'cause they knew
that Deominous

was listening through Grace.

[Grunting]
Oh, uh, hey.

Do... Do you need some help?

Uh, it's... it's okay. It's...

It's... It's not that.
Yeah.

It's just kind of a one-man job.

-Yeah.
No, no, it's stupid anyway.

Hyah!

â™ªâ™ª

Holy shit.

Let's go.

â™ªâ™ª

I'm wiping it all off.

It's okay. It's fine. It's fine.

It's not fine. It's horrible!

Oh, my God.

Ohh!

What are you guys doing?

Huh? What are you doing?

You do everything
Deominous says.

You let him in over and over,

just do whatever
he wants you to do.

And for what?

What do you get?

He gets a sacrifice.

And you get nothing.

You do all this stuff,
and it means nothing.

â™ªâ™ª

Amy?

[Discordant song plays on piano]

â™ªâ™ª

Amy...

â™ªâ™ª

What...

I'm doing nothing.

â™ªâ™ª


â™ªâ™ª

Will...

I'm here.

Okay. What kind of thing
would a demon make?

Oh!

No, Will made that.

Cheese board.

But if the ghost
wanted to help us,

why are they helping the demon?

-Well, they're not good or bad.
They're just dead.

But once Deominous possessed
their spirit form,

he can kind of use them
to do whatever he wants.

I think he might be
overextending himself right now.

Like Will with his hobbies.
Exactly.

Deominous is splitting himself

between the other
Amy, Grace, and the spirits.

This could be our chance
to stop him.

This is it, right?

Pottery class.

Really?

â™ªâ™ª

Aah! Aah!

Oh, my God!

Ohh!
[Demonic laughter]

â™ªâ™ª

Hey. Are you okay?

Yeah.
Uh...

does this Will guy make cakes?

Yeah.

Except for one.

â™ªâ™ª

Amy?

[Discordant song continues]

You said you wanted closure.


[Bones cracking]

â™ªâ™ª

[Bones cracking]

Here just... just hold on
just a second, please.

Just stop. Just...

I just...
I gotta tell you something.

[Growling]
Um...

There's so many great things
you're gonna do.

And you're so sure of yourself
and where you're going.

And...

I was scared to go
with you that night

because I thought if I went,
you'd see just

how much your life's
moving forward and...

how you deserve more than me.

[Weak growling]

So I'm not gonna keep
holding on to you.



[Static fades]

â™ªâ™ª

Will?

Hey! Hey.

â™ªâ™ª

I thought... I thought
you were gone forever.

'Cause you were digging
that hole forever.

Digging what?

[Doorknob rattling]

Wait!
No.

I'm not quitting
this time, okay?

Everyone's getting out of this.

That demon's going back to Hell,

and you and I...

You know, we'll...
whatever you want.

I'm very... casual and open.


[Door slams]

Oh, my God!

[Demonic laughter]

â™ªâ™ª

Oh, Amy. This is Aimee.

She spells her name
with two E's.

Hi.
[Growls]

Um, so, Grace is Deominous now.

What should we do?
Deominous could not listen

to Will's little speech anymore.

You made him so mushy and gross!

He can have his girlfriend back!

Oh, we're not...
We're not toge...

Are... No, we're not.
Look!

She's digging a hole to Hell
or something, man.


I've never seen
anything like that.

I have.

My rotten tooth, remember?

It was covered in nasty plaque
just like this.

Plaque?


â™ªâ™ª

Oh, my parents stopped
buying that stuff.

Tastes like shit.

They changed the formula, Jake.

All right, yeah.

Aah!

Deominous already
has a sacrifice.

You cannot save Grace now.
It is over.

â™ªâ™ª

Aah!


â™ªâ™ª

[Rumbling, sizzling]


â™ªâ™ª

-[Growls]
That did not look cool!

And now Deominous
has to dig another hole!

Don't listen to her, man!

That was awesome. That was...

That was one of the coolest
things I've ever seen you do.

It was?

Also, I kicked the shit
out of a door upstairs.

Nice.
Deominous!

I cast you out of Grace Sellers!

[Demonic laughter]

No! [Laughs]

Then I banish you
to an object of your creation!

Oh! That, right?

-No!

â™ªâ™ª

[Clock ticking]

[Grunting ]

Will!
Amy!

â™ªâ™ª

Hyah!

Aah!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

It didn't work.

It didn't work...

â™ªâ™ª



[Oozing, bubbling]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

We did it.

Where's Mom and Dad?

Right here.

We got trapped
in the guest room.

It was awful.

But we survived.

But...

what about the ghosts?

Well, we destroyed the object
containing Deominous's spirit,

so they're free to move on
to the next realm.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[Scott Joplin's
"The Entertainer" plays]

â™ªâ™ª

I guess they're happy here.

Oh, no. No, no.

This is our house.
The demon left,

so they have to go, too.

â™ªâ™ª

Do something!

I can't. They're at peace.

[TV turns on]

Over my dead body.

That's my remote,
my TV, my house!

â™ªâ™ª

Hi.

â™ªâ™ª

What?

It's just what you said.

You didn't give up on me
or that girl or...

any of it.

â™ªâ™ª

Come on.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[Doorbell rings]

Hey.
Hey.

Um, your cake looks amazing.
Thank you.

I'm sure you made
some extravagant cake

that's gonna put
all ours to shame.

Oh, what? No. No, no, no.

â™ªâ™ª

Ken.

And this is the living room.

-I know.
I'm selling you the house.

Orange belt. Nice.

Mom, can we go play?
Yeah.

[Door opens]

Happy saving you from the demon

who wanted to take
your soul to Hell Anniversary.

Yeah. That one's, uh, for you.

Oh, dude,
the whole cake's for Amy?

Oh, no, I mean,
everyone can have some.

Um, Ken, did you want
to try some cake?

You think some cake
is gonna make up for you

letting those damn ghosts
ruin our property value?

-Come on.
You know, they don't...

They don't know any better.

You can't blame them
for being...

Ohh!

[Chuckles uneasily]

You just gotta let them do
what they're gonna do.

I mean, take this guy,
for example.

He loves dark little corners
and closets.

Don't you, bud? [Chuckles]

Yeah.
You see the shirt he's wearing?

I'm not getting it back
for an eternity.

He told me that... in Latin.

I got a Latin dictionary.

No, no!

And he's not getting his creepy
little toy horse thingy back.

Two can play at this game.


[Door opens]

Just great.

Sign here,
and this nightmare house

and all the terrible things
in it are yours.

Okeydokey.

[Tape rewinding]

â™ªâ™ª

[Walkman clicks, static]

So it's been a year?

That's what you're celebrating?

And six months
since we started our business.

It was Will's idea.

And his toothpaste overstock.

We just bought the rights
from Presto Paste

when they changed
their formula back,

and I got to bust out the old
patent acquisition contract.

What a rush. [Pen scratching]

Great. Have a wonderful life.

I hope we never meet again.

Until you need
to close a Hell portal.

Sorry.
We'll call you.

[Door creaks]

I can't find Grace anywhere.

Grace?!

Grace?!

â™ªâ™ª

[Door creaking]

Sorry. I was listening to this.

Can I keep it?

Yeah.

[Engine starts]

â™ªâ™ª

Does it feel weird
to part with that thing?

No, I never want
to see it again.

Maybe it was a good thing
we went through all of that.

Yeah. In a way,
I'm kind of glad it happened.

I'm not.
Well, I think we can all

be glad that
he never found a vessel

that would allow him
to leave the house.

Yeah.
Yeah.

That would be terrible.

â™ªâ™ª

[Walkman clicks]

[Demonic laughter]

[Music distorts]

[Demonic laughter]

â™ªâ™ª

Oh, shit.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Movin' along

â™ª You know you've been sick,
child â™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Baggage

â™ª Follow your home

â™ª You know it's
wherever you go â™ª

â™ª Take it

â™ª Know you got your demons

â™ª Coming for the weekend

â™ª You give 'em everything
that you have â™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Movin' along

â™ª You know you've been
seen and gone â™ª

â™ª Halfway

â™ª Ooh, ooh, ooh

â™ª In your eyes

â™ª I'm scared
you'll see the truth â™ª

â™ª I need it

â™ª You know you got your demons

â™ª Least I can see them

â™ª They show me everything
that you hide â™ª

â™ªâ™ª
