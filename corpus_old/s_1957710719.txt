You don't speak Romanian?

Um, no, I don't. Sorry.

[speaking Romanian]

Hey, easy.

[driver speaking Romanian]

What did he say?

He said he hates you.
[laughs]

No, no, no, I say
you are beautiful.

<i>- Frumoasa.

Oh, well, that's my favorite.

Stale peanuts and

Why did she think I
didn't like the place?

Because you smile too much.

Are you telling me that I walk
around grinning like an idiot?

Only around me.


Mm... you're insufferable.

[rain pouring]


No.

Sorry if I woke you.

Come here.

Any reason in particular
you're standing in the dark?

Just people watching.

How was work?

[man sighs] Exhausting.

But good.

Is this for me?

It's for you.

It's kind of silly.

Yes.

It is. Very silly.

And I love it.

[â™ª]

For you.

What is it?

It's a... [speaks

A symbol of what?

That spring has arrived.

Isn't it obvious?
[laughs]

[siren wailing]

[â™ª]

What's happening?

[speaking Romanian]

They're not sure.

[man speaking Romanian on TV]

[woman speaking Romanian on TV]

[volume increases]

Hey.
Hey, come look at this.

I think this is what we
passed by the other night.

What are they saying?

[speaking Romanian]

They're talking about the
last time she was seen.

She was murdered?
So it seems.

[speaking Romanian]

That guy was there.
What is he saying?

He found the body.

How did she, uh...

[woman speaking Romanian on TV]

They didn't say.

They're gonna be here at 7:00.

Okay.

out if Simion likes me

or if he thinks I'm an idiot.

I swear, every time I think
I'm getting in with him,

he shuts the door in
my face like I'm...

fuckin' Diane Keaton at
the end of <i>The Godfather.</i>

Hey.

What?

What's up?

Nothing.

There's this guy that
lives across the street,

and he's always
looking over here.

Looking in over here how?

Every time I look over
there, he's just...

standing in his window

and it's like he's
staring right at me.

Which window is it?

Right there.

[man] I can't see anything.
[Julia] Because it's day.

looks in at night?

see him at night.

Doesn't mean that he's not...

You know what? Forget it.

No. Come on.

If you're feeling
uncomfortable about something,

we should talk about it.

Really. I'm fine.

So you're Diane Keaton now?

Mm-hm. That's
exactly what I said.


[man laughing,
speaking Romanian]

I'm... I'm sorry, I was just
telling your husband that

he needs some new accounts.

What else do they have you on?

Uh... Frosty Cakes,

and some company that
sells office supplies

marketed towards women.
[laughs]

You just need to make a
better impression on Simion.

Oh, that's a really
good idea. Thank you.

I hadn't thought of that.
[man laughs]

And don't confuse
<i>chinui</i> with <i>se chinui.</i>

[laughing]
What happened?

Nothing, I just made this
silly mistake earlier

during a presentation

and I'm never gonna
hear the end of it.

to say to a client

that he'd fight for them,

but instead he said
he'd torture them.


Oh, uh, is it okay
if I smoke in here?

Uh, well, Julia gave up
smoking a few months ago.

Really? I don't see
you as a smoker.

I'm trying not to be.

I... I don't have to.
No. No, really.

It's totally fine.

be a bad influence.

No, it... it's fine.
[man] All right. Thanks.

us you're an actress.

Oh, um, yeah. I... I was.

Um...
[lighter flicks]

Wasn't really for me,

so I'm, um, reevaluating.

Uh, Jules and I had an interesting
experience the other night, didn't we?

We were walking just
a few blocks away,

we go past this crime
scene, a bunch of cops.

This afternoon, we turn on
the news and there it is.

[woman] What happened?
[man] They found a woman murdered in her apartment.

Yeah, you heard about it too?
[man speaking Romanian]

[laughing, speaking Romanian]

Bullshit.

What?

Do I need to leave so
the grownups can talk?

They're saying the woman
had her head cut off.

You didn't tell me that.
They didn't say anything about that.

It must be related
to the other attacks.

So, uh, they found a
woman about a month ago

with her throat slit
in her apartment

around the same age.

So, but this one,
he cut so deep,

it was essentially
a decapitation.

They're calling him The Spider.

[speaking Romanian]

[woman] Do you need help?
[Julia] No, no, no, I'm fine.

Yeah.

Can you hear me?

Um, yes, your
English is perfect.

Thank you, but I meant

can you hear me
inside my apartment?

Oh, um... no. Not really.


Can you hear us?

No. You are
suspiciously quiet.

love you for this.

I'm Irina.
Julia.

Just bang on my wall if I'm
ever making too much noise.

going into my skin.</i>

<i>But then he stopped</i>

to me, watching me.</i>

[indistinct dialog]

Simion says they
like to be wooed,

so we're going to
headquarters in Sofia

to do the whole song and dance.

I don't know yet if it's
gonna be Nicolae or me.

That's great.

You're not hungry?

Uh... not really.

This, uh, weird thing happened.

Um... there was this guy
at the movie theater,

and then he...

followed me into
the supermarket.

Followed you?

Yeah.

Did he say something to you?

Uh, no.

No.

Did he follow you here?

No, I don't think so.

You okay?

Yeah.

I think I just need
to sleep it off.

Come here.

The good news is, if
he ever comes here,

you have your big strong
man to protect you.


Okay.

I'm gonna pretend you
didn't just laugh at that.


I'm sorry.

No, um...

No, you... You don't
have to apologize.

I don't know why I
reacted like that.

No, no, I... I totally get it.

Do you want to go back
to the supermarket?

I mean, they gotta have
security tapes, right?

[speaking Romanian]

[speaking Romanian]

He thought you were
trying to steal.

Oh, I wasn't trying
to steal something.

There was a man that
was following me,

I was just trying to hide.

[speaking Romanian]

time were you in?

Uh, around four, I think.

[speaking Romanian]

What'd he look like?

Uh, he was white,

mm, older.

He was wearing a brown jacket.

[Francis speaking Romanian]

[speaking Romanian]


[â™ª]

That's him.

Oh, okay, watch.

Wait for it.

Just wait.

There. See?

He's staring right at me.


Or what?

Or he's staring at the
woman who's staring at him.

[camera shutter clicks]

[â™ª]

[toaster clattering]


Of course. I'll be fine.

with some clients tonight,

so I'm gonna be
out kind of late.

Okay.


[door opens, closes]

[â™ª]

[phone line ringing]

Hey.

I was just wondering when
you're gonna be back home.

Yeah, I figured.

Do you know when you'll be back?

No, it's just, um...

No, it's fine. Um, it's fine.

Yeah, I'll see you
when you're back.

You too.

[woman speaking Romanian]

I...

[speaking Romanian]

Elvis?
[woman] Elvis.

[speaking Romanian]
[Irina] It's her cat.

What?
Elvis is her cat.

He's gone missing and
she's trying to find him,

and she wants to know
if you've seen him.

Uh, I'm sorry, I...
I haven't seen him.

Oh...

[speaking Romanian]

Poor Eleonora. That cat is
always trying to escape her.

Thanks, by the way.

My husband usually
translates, but...

still at work.

Working at 10 p.m.?

Is he a stripper?

No, no, works in marketing.

With a client.
Mm.

Do you feel like
coming in for a drink?

I feel like another
one, and it's less sad

if there's another
person with me.

Yeah. Sure.
Yeah?

That sounds nice.

Okay.

[lock clicks]

Come in.
[keys clatter]

stayed out longer.

I look radiant with vodka.

Do you like port?

Yeah. Sure.

<i>- Noroc.
Noroc.</i>

[glasses clink]

[speaking Romanian]

See? You do.


I wanted to surprise Francis.

One day, just say
something very casually.

[music playing on stereo]
So your husband's Romanian?

Uh, his mother is but
he grew up in the US.

And he brought you back
to the home country.

Yeah. Got a promotion,

and they needed someone
in the Bucharest office.

It must be hard for you, though.

It was hard for me when
I first moved away.

I studied ballet in London
before I injured my knee.

My English was terrible.

I fell madly in love
with it eventually,

but the first few months,
I was terribly lonely.

Yeah, me too.

Definitely be lonely.

At least you have
your husband with you.

I'm sorry, did I say
something to upset you?

No.
Are you sure?

[banging on door]


[Irina speaking Romanian]

[continues speaking Romanian]

[loud bang]
[man speaking Romanian]

Is everything okay?

Yeah. It's just my ex.

He sounds kind of scary.

sounds like that.

It's all a show.

He's actually very sweet.

Anyway, he knows not
to cross the line.

And what if he does?

[imitates gunshot]
[laughing]

I'm serious.

Open it.

Whoa.

He gave it to me as a
present when we were together

to defend myself.

I think he regrets
it now but, uh,

it just makes it easier for me

to tell him to go fuck himself.

I should tell more people
to go fuck themselves.

You should.
Mm-hm.

You should say...
[speaking Romanian]

[speaking Romanian]

[laughing]
Perfect!

[no audible dialog]

[â™ª]

[â™ª]

You're not really

[â™ª]

[â™ª]

[keys clatter]

Jules?


I saw the man in
the window again.

I waved at him.

And he waved back.

Which one is it?

One floor up to the left.


He's in there.

Don't...

Do you see him?

No, I can't see anything.

It's too dark.

I want to call the cops.

Is that really necessary?
Yes.

you from the theater

across the street to the market?

I think so.

You think so?

[officer speaking Romanian]

[speaking Romanian]

Mm-hm. Can you
describe him please?

I have a photo.

So you think this is the same
man you saw in the window?

I think it could be.

You could identify
his face in a window

in the building
across the street?

Not exactly.

It was dark. It was
his silhouette mostly.

Mostly?
Look, this isn't normal.

He's always there
looking in here.

I... I can feel him.


I'll go over there, see if
he's looking in the window.

That's not polite, so...
I'll talk with him.

If you want, you
can come with me,

see if it's the same
man as in the picture,

so I think so can
become yes or no.

I don't think
that's a good idea.


I'd like to get a look at him.

Maybe I could just hang back,

get a glance of him
around the corner.

Right?

Yeah, sure.

[â™ª]

[â™ª]

[lock clicks]

Was it him?

Francis, was it him?

Listen to me for a second.
Even if it was him,

the guy lives in
our neighborhood.

It's not crazy to think that he'd
be shopping at the same store.

I need you to stop
rationalizing this all away.

You want me to stop
being rational?

To just jump to the craziest
conclusion like you?

You think I'm crazy?

No, I think...

I think you're stressed,

and you're alone
here all day long...

Stop.
You're in this new country...

Stop!

Stop talking to me like
I'm a fucking child.

[Julia sighs, sniffles]

I can't... I can't stay here.

Julia.
[Julia sighs]

I want to leave.

Leave, like pack
our bags right now?

You want to head to
a hotel or... or,

what, you want to get on
a plane back to New York?

Please, just tell me
what you want me to do?

I want you to
fucking believe me!


This is just a bad night, Jules.

It's not a bad night.

I can't think here,
I can't breathe,

I mean, I... I feel
like I'm losing my mind.


What... What can I do?

What can I do to help?

Nothing.

[â™ª electronica]

Julia?

You followed him here?

Francis thinks that
I'm overreacting.

But he's been watching
us since we moved in.

Do you know him?

I think he works
here as a cleaner.

People come and go
here all the time.

I never really get a
good look at their faces.

They all have the
same dumb expression,

and they start to
blend together.

Have you noticed anyone
watching you in your apartment?

No.

But maybe I've gotten
used to having eyes on me.

Do I just sound paranoid?

Let's just hope
you'll never find out.

The best outcome might be

having to live with
the uncertainty.

Better than getting
raped and strangled,

and dying with the words "I told
you so" on your lips. Right?

[beads clattering]
[man speaking Romanian]

Sorry. I have to
get back to work.

Thank you for looking after me.

I'm sorry I've been

It's your job.

moved here to be with me.

Well, that's presumptuous.

Maybe I've always wanted to live

an aimless existence
in Bucharest

smoking cigarettes

and scaring my neighbors
with my hysterics.

You thought she needed help.
I don't blame you for it.

I gotta go into work
for a few hours today,

but we have cocktails tonight.

If you're up for it.
Yeah, I'm good.


I was wondering if you know
a woman that works there?

Her name's Irina. She
didn't come home last night

and I was just wondering
if you've heard from her

or seen her?

Okay. All right. Thank you.

[pounding on door]

Are you looking for Irina?

You know where she is?

No, I just saw her
last night at work.

We were supposed to meet at my
apartment after she finished.

She never came?

It's not the first time,
but, no, she never came.

Do you know where she would be?


I don't think so. I would
have heard her come in.

Do you have her phone number?

Yeah, but... she
doesn't answer me.

Do you mind if I
try and call her?

Yeah.

[phone line ringing]

[ringtone playing]

Mm-hm. You hear that?

[speaking Romanian]

Wait.

Could you help me
with something?

[â™ª]

So you want me to
knock on his door

and get the guy to come out?

Yeah, I just need to see him.

Why?
[dings]

I think that he's
been following me.

The police say they
can't do anything,

but I need to know for myself
that it's the same person.

[dings]
Fucking cops are useless.


[elevator door opens]

So which one?

Hm... that's the corner.

That one there.

Four doors down.

On the left?

Yeah.


[knocking continues]

I think there is someone inside.

But they don't answer.

[cell phone rings]
[speaking Romanian]

Uh, sorry, I gotta go.

Can you just try one more time?

Okay.

[pounding]
[speaking Romanian]


Sorry. I tried.

Wh... What did you say?

Uh... [chuckles]

To stop bothering you.

But don't worry.

He probably has a
little crush on you.

[cell phone rings]

Um, if you see Irina,

can you tell her that I came by?

Okay.

Julia, this is Daniel Weber.

He lives in the building
across from you.

Mr. Weber made a
complaint with us today

about a neighbor who
has been harassing him.

[Francis] Harassing him?
[officer] Yeah.

Looking at his window,
following him around,

showing up at his door and
threatening his father.

And I remember Mr. Weber
from your complaint,

and I wanted to resolve this
before it goes any further.

So if you both can agree that
this was misunderstanding,

and, uh, that's not
gonna go any further,

we can all go on with our lives.

[speaking Romanian]

Let me know when they're gone.

[door closes]


I saw this today.

What is this?

caught The Spider.

Remember the guy who found her?

He was a plumber.

Did a job for the last victim.

They found a bunch of her
clothes in his apartment.

He'd already been
in prison for rape.

[â™ª]

[no audible dialog]

Simion. My wife, Julia.

She is as beautiful as you
described her, Francis.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

We were just talking
about the big news.

Did Francis get a promotion?

No, no, they caught The Spider.

So Francis and Julia live
near one of the victims.

So they saw the crime scene.

We just walked past it, really.

Oh.
[Francis] That's all

[speaking Romanian]

Francis said that you
are having some trouble

with one of your neighbors.

Maybe it was him.

Can you imagine? [chuckles]

[speaking Romanian]

[speaking Romanian]
[laughing]

[speaking Romanian]


[man speaking Romanian]


What did you just say?

It's just a stupid work joke.

What did he say?
Jules. Come on.

No, no, really, it was
just some office gossip.

How about more champagne?
I need a refill.

At least I have The Spider to...

To what?
Julia.

have The Spider to...

to keep me company?

Is that what you...

At least I have that.

[clattering]
[glass breaking]

where are you going?

Will you please stop?
What?

I can't take a joke?

Is that what you're
gonna tell me right now?

I don't know what to
do anymore, Julia.

I'm tired.

I'm tired of feeling like this

because you can't let go
of some fuckin' fantasy.

It could be signal

There could be a

chasing a dog as we speak.

So...

how long does it take?


Not long.

If you're fast.

Usually, it just
takes a few minutes.

Even if it seems longer.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

Why are you following me?

I don't control the trains.

Let me explain.

I spend all day looking
after my father,

he's very sick.

And so sometimes I...

go to the window and...

just look at people...

going about their day.

I know it is a sad hobby.

But no one has really
noticed before.

"You've really become sad
old man now," I thought.

Dreaming up a...

pretty girl who's...

finally looking back at you.

But then you waved.

And I thought...

that you were saying...

hello.

That's why I was
so... So surprised

when your husband
came to my door

with the police officer.

I did not understand

what I had done that was so bad.

And why you kept following me.

I wondered if you were
trying to embarrass me.

Or if you were
trying to scare me...

when you came to my
door with that man...

and cursed at my father.

I had hoped that after
I involved the police

that would be the end of it.

But I felt...

I felt that what
I really needed...

was an apology.

I'm sorry.
