Lunch boxes! Come and eat here!

From a Western view

the nation of China

is completely different
from their own nation

on the other hand

the citizens of China have
had to fight off their invasion and

the gradual realization that

the country of China should be recognized
as a unified whole

Confronting the invasion of imperialism

the people of China
all share the same grounding principles

of destiny, fate, honor and misfortune

The revolutionists underwent a long time
to bring this practice into fulfillment

the revolutionists and
theorists gave continuous explanations

on the objective
existence of Chinese people in China

finally through thousands of years
of self-reliance and development

it has given the people of China...

a sense of national consciousness
and understanding

To summarize the nation of China
is a term that has gone through

extensive theoretical
and social-scientific study

The Communist Party clearly understands...

he key conflicts effecting modern China

is the contradiction of foreign
imperialism on the Chinese nation

it is wholly necessary
for the nation of China to unite

and demand the right of liberation
from external aggressors

and internally,
to bring equality to all Chinese people

Understanding the root problem
of Chinese Nationalism,

he formulation of the Chinese

Communist Party carried out the most...

suitable national policy
for the people of China

therefore, creating a central
foundation bringing unification...

for the nation of China

Their guidance gave independence

and liberation for the whole nation
of China.

The Meaning & Significance
of the Nation of China.

The national patriotic educational...

broadcast program special has ended.

Thank you for listening.

Mister, I'm going to Ma-duo,
heading in the right direction?

I'm going to Hua-Shi Valley.

You can change there.

Jump on.

Thank you!

Cheers!

You little rascal! Don't get lost!

Looking for a room?

Where are you from?

Hong Kong.

Ah! Hong Kong.

Wait a minute, please.

Follow me.

Thanks.

This one.

This is the best one we have.

Have a rest.

Thanks.

Long time no see!

How are you doing?

Very good!

I've come here to help you!

That's great!

Let me go in and see.

Very good, thank you very much!

Come in.

Hot water...

Are you here on holiday?

Looking for someone.

Please have you seen this person before?

You've seen him?

You look like him.

He's my elder brother.

I don't think I have seen him.

Take a rest.

Thanks.

Excuse me.

What do you want?

Please, have you seen this person?

A roll of film?

Eighteen dollars.

Not this one.

Please. Have you seen this person?

No.

Ni-Ma!

Have you seen this man?

Thanks.

Hey! Can of Pepsi?

Watch where you going? Fucker!

Mister, please have you seen this person?

No.

This, should have been sent from here.

So many people come in here everyday,
how can I remember them all.

Please have another look,
this is very important.

I have come a long way to find him.

Stop hassling me.
Look I said I haven't seen him!

Come on help him. You're not busy anyway.

Oh my god! This was sent three years ago!

How would I know?

I haven't seen him,
you're better off asking somewhere else!

Please, have you seen this person?

No, I haven't.

Thanks. That's okay.

Hey! Where do you want to go?

May I follow you?

Can I be your 'kammo'?

What is 'kammo'?

'Kammo' means wife.

Why do you want to be my 'kammo'?

This dumb kid is always like this.
Ignore her.

I keep seeing you everywhere,
are you looking for someone?

Yes!

Have you seen this person?

I've just started working here,
I don't know much.

Ask my friend here.

He used to live here.

If you know anything about him,
let me know,

I have come a long way.

Are you from Hong Kong?

Guang-dong.

Where in Guang-dong?

Guang-zhou.

Really?

They don't really remember.

Can't really blame them,
Ma-duo's a stop-over place.

Why are you looking for him?

Just looking.

Thanks.

Two large bread, to take-away.

How are you, have you found him yet?

Not yet.

Good luck.

If you need the postal service,
come and find me.

Alright.

It was built last year.
By a Hong Kong person.

Can't imagine Run Run Shaw
arriving here before me.

The old man may have met my brother.

Look. Ma-duo's a rural place
it needs modernization.

Everyday it's different.

Go back.

I want to stay a while.

Do you want to borrow this?

You ride it.

You're here!

To Hong Kong.

Hong Kong... six dollars twenty.

Give it here.

Such a small place. You get use to it.

No. I'm only twenty-one.

I've worked at this post office
for three years now,

once I went to Xian, apart from that
I've never been anywhere else.

Xian. It's quite a busy place!

I'll be leaving tomorrow.

What?

I said I'm leaving tomorrow!

You've only been here a few days,
leaving already?

Why are you looking for him?

I can't read.

I received this three years ago,

sent from Ma-duo.

He suddenly disappeared
when I was young...

Early one day I woke up to suddenly
see my brother had gone.

Afterwards I began receiving postcards...

and photo from all over China,

I never thought of looking for him.

Three years ago, I received this letter.

Since then I have not
received anything else.

Sorry, I just said...

That's okay, I understand.

He's been gone so many years,

you've only been looking for a few days.

Well I'll be leaving tomorrow afternoon!

One Lamb-meat noodle.

Add more garlic, not hot, please.

Coming-up!

Get me another Er-Guo-Tou.

Here it is!

Thanks!

What's the matter?
Can't handle the hot from Guang-dong?

From Hong Kong.

Fuck! Isn't Hong Kong in Guang-dong?

Drink some.

First sip and I fell in love with it.

There isn't anything like this
in Hong Kong, don't know what I'll do?

Have you seen him?

He's my elder brother.

Na-Ri. It's ready.

Hey! Photo!

Na-Ri. Pay up this time!

Sorry.

You know him!

Lamb-meat noodle,
add more garlic, not hot.

You say it just like your brother.

It's been years.

Tell me, where has he gone?

You must know!

Hold it!

Take another one!

You look alike!

Are you going to tell me?

The photo you are holding, I took it.

That time, my skill was crap,
I used a tripod.

Drink this.

This Er-Guo-Tou,

first time your brother and me...

had this we got really drunk.

Fucking puked everywhere!

First sip and I fell in love with it.

Fucking thought he was really back!

The blood in his veins are sounds
of gallops

The holy sun shines in his eyes

Highland Barley wine fills his heart,
when he sings

The whole world is in his hands,

in his hands

Aren't you leaving today?

Today, I bumped into someone
who knew my brother.

You knew him!

Follow me!

I get a new one.

Let me.

When I was small, my greatest achievement
was changing the light bulb.

Because my dad wouldn't get
on the chair to change it,

this was when I felt
the most satisfaction.

In these days,

I would sometimes lie awake in bed,

staring at the light bulb up
at the ceiling, all night.

Looking at what?

I remember there was a man
who helped change a light bulb for me,

that night he also told me
exactly this same story.

Well,
you ever thought of leaving with him?

It's nice here, isn't it?

You see it, come in!

Let me go inside, please.

Okay!

I think this is what you are looking for.

Take these with you.

I'm on my own.
Since then I've always on my own.

You're in a hurry to leave?

I'll be going to
my brother-in-law's farm tomorrow,

do you want to come with me?

Alright.

Present from my brother?

This is the only thing I have of him.

Ren Qing-Jia!

Ren Qing-Jia! Ren Qing-Jia...

Duo Ri-Ma!

How do you do? How do you do?

Where's your sister?

Where is your 'kammo'?

I have no 'kammo'.

She has passed away.

Sorry.

Why are you saying sorry?

Did you kill her?

We don't talk about the dead.

It's disrespectful.

Little rascal, hop on.

Thanks.

Xia Ri-Ge!

Xia Ri-Ge?

Eagles breed in the sky,

Fiercely hooking onto each other
with their claws,

they play and roll around, then

suddenly stop and
seem to fall down from the sky.

Really!

Eagles mate in the sky,

they separate before
they reach the ground.

This is because eagles fly alone.

But humans are not the same.

Does he really want to live a solitary
life up in the plains?

It's fucking freezing!

Have you not got it in tune yet?

It's impossible to tune.

The fret board's bent.

The Pegasus-Zeus star!

Where? How can you see it?

Well,

actually I don't know.

I just made it up.

I say it to chat-up girls.

Even if I said it to them,
they will still ask.

You smart arse!

They say, when people die,

there's one less star.

Finished?

But the kid's mother always says:

When people die...

a star appears in the sky.

How are you?

When a person dies they turn into star.

What for?

So at night, they light the way
for people walking down below.

Fuck that!

Thanks!

Are you missing home?

Where is his home?

Here! Beijing!

When I was younger,

I was walking up in the hills with my dad,

he unexpectedly stopped on the spot.

My threatening stern father,

just stood there,

and began watching the ants on the ground.

I don't know why but this
has remained deep in my memory.

I'm not sure...

what kind of relationship we had.

I never really knew at all.

We've never laughed together,

cried together,

or experienced ever the kind
of relationship between father and son.

Have never traveled together,

or fought together.

Sometimes the people we love grow
apart from us little by little,

or somehow the people who love us
gradually fall into the distance.

I know each and every one of us
will travel on life's journey,

and there is no turning back.

I see and can only say, I wish you well,

a good journey,

take care.
