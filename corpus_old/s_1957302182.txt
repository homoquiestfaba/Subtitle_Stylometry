Whoa! What is that, yo?

It looks like some kind
of alien spaceship.

Oh, how wonderful.

Perhaps these aliens
are the peaceful kind

that enjoy playing that

If Hollywood movies
have taught me anything,

it's that space aliens only
come here for one reason,

to replace us!

Well, no alien is replacing me.

Greetings, Earthlings.

We are the Nerdlucks.

Oh, my goodness.
I know these guys.

They're the aliens
from<i> Space Jam.</i>

What's a<i> Space Jam?</i>

It's only the greatest
sports movie of all time.

Sorry. Never heard of it.

Me neither.
Nor the I.

How have you never heard of it?

It stars Bugs Bunny
and Michael Jordan.

Michael Jordan?

Oh, yeah.

That's the dude who
sells all them shoes.

Oh, I wish to watch the movie about
the salesman who plays the basketball.

Well, we happen to
own a copy on VHS.

But our VCR is busted.

No problem. We've got
a VCR in the tower.

We can watch it there.

Yeah, let's check this out.
Oh, yeah!

Excellent!
Let's do this.

Wait, are you guys crazy?

Inviting these aliens into our
home is a horrible idea, Titans.

How do we know we
can even trust them?

Just sit down and
watch the movie, dude.

Oh, yeah. <i>Space Jam!</i>

No.

This is <i>Teen
Titans Go! See Space Jam.</i>

Now let's fast forward
to get to the good stuff.

I just feel at this particular
time that I reached the pinnacle

of my basketball career
and I must retire.

Holdup. MJ is retiring?

Nice going, Cyborg. You skip
to the end of the movie.

Nah, this is the beginning.

But he said he was the done
playing the basketball.

Yeah, he says that a lot.

Anybody this, except
for one person, and, uh,

but I think I'm gonna go and
play professional baseball.

What
position will you play?

I don't know.
As a kid, I was a pitcher.

I think that'd be kind
of hard for me to pitch,

so I think I'm gonna
play the outfield now.

No way!

There's an amusement
park in space?

And look, it's
named after Robin.

Ha. Very funny.

But mark my words, Titans,
you're all making a huge mistake.

Woo-hoo!

Let's get out of here,
Dad, this stinks.

Don't bring me here
anymore, all right?

<i>Don't bring me here
anymore, all right?</i>

Are you listening?

Did you hear him?

Did you hear him?

That little brat is right.

I've told you, if
I've told you once...

Yo, that's Danny DeVito.

My dude played The Penguin.

Man,
where's Batman.

I told you a thousand, thousand,
thousand, thousand times!

We need new attractions.

Right!
New ones.

Uh-huh.

Get it?

Big, shiny new things. Yeah.

Absolutely, sir.

Look at me. Look
at me and listen.

The customer is always right.

Right.

What is he the doing?

He's smoking.

But smoking is so bad
for you, yo.

Right.

Okay, we need something...
Oop!

My bad.

We need something...

Nutty.

Nutty?

I hopes ya'll don't mind, but I
loves counting butt shots in movies.

That's one.

Something wacky.
 Wacky.

We need something, something,
something, something...

-We need something-
-Looney? Oops.

Looney. Thank you.

Looney?

<i>I'm an elk! Shoot me!</i>

Yes! Looney! Yes!

Now you're talking. Looney.

Looney. That's it, that's the
word I was looking for, Looney.

Get the Looney Tunes.
Looney Tunes!

Bring 'em here.

Sir, just noticing, sir.

They're from Earth.

What if they can't come?

What did you say? What
if they can't come?

Uh-huh?

Make 'em.
Cool.

<i>Make 'em.</i>

<i> We're gonna get 'em.</i>

<i>We're gonna get
'em. Yeah, right.</i>

Cyborg's fun fact.

The number 45 was Michael's
high school jersey number.

Strike!

Looks good in a uniform.

Looks great. Can't teach that.

Can't teach it.

Podolak!

Podolak, come here.

I'm sorry I didn't mean...
Come here.

Yes, sir?

I want you to make sure
that nobody bothers Michael.

I want him to be the
happiest player in the world.

The happiest.

Slider. Don't swing.

Strike three!

I told you not to swing.
Couldn't help it.

I understand. Hey,
nice talking to ya.

Wow. Everyone's so supportive
of Michael striking out.

I believe they are hoping to get the
free sneakers from the nice salesman.

We're not worried.
We're not worried.

Good job, Michael.
Get out there, Michael. Don't worry.

Good try. Good hustle.

Good cut, Michael. Good cut.

That was a strike out, Mike. That was
a good-looking strike out. Real good.

I mean, you look good
when you strike out, man.

When I strike out, man,
it looks nasty, man.

At least you look good, man.

Hi, Mr. Jordan.

Mr. Jordan, I'm Stan...

Ow, jeez.

You all right? That
was a nasty fall.

Yeah. Oh, I'm Stan
Podolak, Mr. Jordan

I'm the Barons' new publicist.

I'm here to make
your life easier.

You want me to drive you somewhere,
I will drive you anywhere.

You want me to pick up your
laundry, babysit your kids,

I will do it.

I knew I recognized that dude.

That's that fool from<i>
Jurassic Park,</i> yo.

I am here to
personally guarantee

that no one will
ever bother you.

Friends, look. It
is the Santy Claus.

Ho, ho, ho.

What was that?

Hang on.

Hanging on.

Why is Looney Tunes in
the center of the Earth?

Because it's the looniest place
the writers could think of.

Oh. Whatever.

Bombastic.
Cool.

All right, you
irascible bunny. Come back.

Ho, ho. There's my man Bugs.

I'll be with you
in a second, folks,

after I finish with
nature boy here. Oop.

All right, pesky wabbit.
I've got you now.

Here's a fun fact.

Bugs Bunny got his name when
legendary animator "Ben-Bugs" Hardaway

drew a sketch of a
rabbit which got labeled

by his fellow coworkers
as Bugs' Bunny.

And Elmer Fudd was
originally named Egghead.

Ouch.

Hmm.

One small step for<i> moi!</i>

<i> Moi!</i>
One giant leap for Moron Mountain!

And one whopper
headache for Elmer Fudd.

Diminutive. Ain't they?

We seek the one they call Bugs Bunny.
Yeah, Bugs Bunny.

Have you seen him?

Where is this guy?

Is he around?

Hmm... Bugs Bunny.

Bugs Bunny. Say, does he
have great, big long ears?

Like this?

Yeah.

And does he hop
around like this?

Yeah.

Well, does he say, "What's
up, Doc?" like this?

Eh... What's up, Doc?

Yeah.

Nope, never heard of him.

Aw!

You know, maybe there
is no intelligent life

out there in the
universe after all.

Hold on there,
Mr. Looney Tune.

Ah-ha! Even more proof that
these Nerdlucks are evil!

Ah, Bugs kinda had that coming.

Okay, bunny.

Gather up your Tune pals.

We're taking you for
a ride.

Totally. All right.
So, like, where we goin'?

Are we there yet?

Ah, I'm really sorry it
took so long, but, you know...

Sherm, Sherm,
don't, don't worry about it.

...that exit on 65 wasn't
clearly marked. It was like...

Hold. Hold
on. Right here.

 What, here?
 Yes. Right here.

Oh.

So that's MJ's house?

He must make the
modest of the salaries.

Thanks for the ride,
Sherm. I appreciate it.

It's Stan, Mike.
I'm sorry.

But that's all right. You can
call me Sherm if you want to.

Because I followed
your whole career

and I just think you're the greatest athlete that's...
Stan! Stan, Stan, Stan.

That's ever lived.

Gimme that remote! I
wanna see more Bugs.

Stop the music!

Top duck comin' through!
Hey!

Jeez! It's gettin' so a guy

can't even get himself
wet around here!

So, what's the big emergency?

Uh, these little guys would
like to make an announcement.

Here you go, shorty.

All right. All right.

You, all of you,

are now our prisoners!

See! I told you they
want to abduct us!

Ooh! We're
in big trouble now.

We are taking you to our
theme park in outer space.

No fooling.

Where you will be our slaves

and placed on display
for the amusement

of our paying customers.

Oh, fear clutches
my breast.

Okay. If these Nerdlucks
are so friendly,

then why is Bugs chained up?

He's just doing a
little street magic.

But they just called all of the
Looney Tunes their prisoners!

It's all part of the act, yo.

I don't know. Something
smells fishy...

That would be your
breath, Robin.

We ain't a-goin' nowheres!

Whoa guns!

How bouts we make this
a bit more kid friendly?

That's better.

Oh.

Eh, not so fast, doc.

You just can't turn
us into slaves,

that would be bad.

You've gotta give us a
chance to defend ourselves.

Oh, yeah? Who says?

 Says who?
 Why?

That's another one!

Just a sec.

There! Read em and weep, boys.

What's this?

"Give them a chance
to defend themselves."

Do we have to?

It's in the rule book.
It is.

Okay. It is in the rule book.

<i>Uno momento!</i> We have to confer.

Cyborg fun fact.

This scene is a reference
to the 1970 movie,<i> Patton,</i>

which won Best Picture.

But do you know which 2018 movie

should have won best picture?

All right, troops.

It is for us to choose

a battlefield that affords us...

Oh!  I got it.

Yes, Private Porkster?

How about we
challenge them to a spelling bee?

Say... We could have
a bowling tournament.

Sufferin' Succotash!
What's wrong with all of ya?

I say, we get a ladder,

<i>wait till the old
lady's outta the room,</i>

<i>then grab that little bird.</i>

Whoa! Whoa!

Take a deep breath, Sly!

Okay, let's analyze
the competition.

Hmm. That's a good idea.

Now, uh, what are
we lookin' at here?

Let's see.

We got a small race
of invading aliens.

Small arms! Short legs!

Not very fast.
Hmm.

Tiny little guys.

Can't jump high.

Hey! They's just
described you, Robin.

Very funny.

Uh-huh.

We challenge you to
a basketball game.

All right. Basketball it is!

Basketball!
Oh boy, oh boy.

All right! What is basketball?

What's that?
Beats me.

We didn't have that in school.
I have no idea.

What?
Lights!

Pardon me! Oop, sorry.

Hey! Down in front!

<i> An exhilarating team sport
currently growing rapidly in popularity...</i>

And the game is on!

No good!

Over here! Over here!
Over here! Over here!

And nothing! Still can't
get it in the basket. Man!

Looks like the crowd
is having none of it.

From downtown... Boom!

<i>...Association.</i>

<i>Featuring the best
players in the world!</i>

The best players in the world.
The best!

 Excuse me.
 Excuse me.

 I'm so sorry.
 Sorry.

Excuse me.

Ouch! Get your
feet out of my nose!

Be quiet,
they're looking!

Hey! It's basketball.

Where?
Whoa! Now what?

Hey hey!

Fun Fact. Patricia Heaton

starred on the
sitcom, <i>The Middle,</i>

which was filmed next door

to the offices of<i>
Teen Titans Go!</i>

 What? What?
 She's looking again.

 Close it up! Close it up!
 Tightly.

You
poked me again.

Sweetheart.
What?

I thought you were gonna
get better seats this year.

This is as good as I could get.

This guy next to me

is doing something very
weird in his raincoat.

Pop quiz time.

Dan Castellaneta is the voice
of which famous TV dummy?

If you guessed Robin
you'd be wrong!

Robin isn't famous at all.

Honey, will you just
let me watch the game?

Barkley's killing us!

Hey! Someone's killing someone.

No. Seriously?

Wow! A killer! Let me see!

There! That's him. The killer.

 He's big.
He's good.

He's mine!

Okay. Go get him!

Yeah!
Watch out!

 Hey! Watch it!

Come on. Get back on defense.

Why isn't the crowd shocked

that he just got an
alien up his nose?

You can't shock these
people, they're New Yorkers!

What are you doing?

Time out! Call the time out!

What's wrong with you,
man? You're killin' us.

 Let him in! Let him in!
 Open up!

Open!

Wow! He did it.

I got it! I got his talent.

Super.

Sit down, Chuck.
Hey, man. I'm fine!

Charles.
I am fine!

No, no, no, no! I'm playing
you too many minutes.

I'm not tired!
Go get the doctor.

What's up, baby? You all right?

Yeah, man.
Sure?

Yeah.

Come on, we're
okay. You're okay.

You're all right. Come on, let's go.
Yeah, man.

He catches the ball
like friend Robin!

With the baby hands!

Come on, Patrick. It's showtime!

You guys suck!

Popcorn!

Okay. Okay.

Now, which of you maroons

has ever played
basketball before?

I have, Coach.

And there's an important

strategic question
I need to ask you.

Yes, yes?

What do you think?

I'm kind of partial to
purple and gold myself.

It goes better with my coloring.

A-one, two, three, four. Disco disco duck!
Guys! Nice outfit, Daffy.

The little aliens say
it's their turn to use the court.

Yeah, sure.

Let the little pipsqueaks
knock themselves out.

Too bad you can't practice
getting taller, boys.

Whoooa!

Ah!

Holds up! So you
guys have the ability

to steal our talents

and turn into monster
versions of us?

That's right.

Then what are you
the waiting for?

Yeah, we want to see what
you guys look like as us.

No, no, no. This
is a terrible...

Nah, don't listen
to him. Go for it!

Okay, if you say so.

Whoa! Booyah, dude!

Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

That's what's up!

This is the amazing...

Ha-ha! Huh? Hey! What gives?

Why do they have cool new
talents and I don't have any?

That's 'cause
you got stuck with Robin

and he ain't gots
no talent.

I do too have talent.
Check this out.

And slide, eeeyyy,
ooh-ooh, hooma-chaaa!

Dude, you gotta stop.

Let's just get
back to the movie.

Hey, little pig...

Boo.

I wet myself.

Time to play a
little basketball.

Those little pipsqueaks
just turned into superstars!

They're monsters!

Sufferin Succotash!
They're monstars!

See, Titans? They're monsters!

No, they're Monstars.

That's like a whole
letter difference.

Eh, I think we might need
a little bit of help.

Okay, little fella.

Hey, it's Bill Murray!

I love Bill Murray.

That dude's my hero, yo!
Hero?

But he does not
have the superpower.

Oh, yes, he does.

Bill Murray's superpower
is being Bill Murray.

You my friend, or you my enemy?

You are my friend, right?

You are my ally.

Classic Jordan versus Bird!

That dude's a bird?

Now I see it!

Draw the feathers

and there's the very large beak!

But I'm not sure how
he lays the eggs.

Larry Bird doesn't lay eggs.

He lay-ups!

You are my associate,

my personal assistant.

You are my weapon.

You are leaving.

Oh.

Great shot.
Oh, nice shot, Mr. Murray.

Cyborg's Fun Fact.

Bill Murray's hat was invented
in 1880 by Robert W. Patton!

Who used to predict weather
for<i> The Seattle Times.</i>

Good try.
Not bad. Not bad.

Something for
you all to shoot at.

Hit it good, Larry.
Do my best.

It was a good shot.

Yeah, I know.

Mike, I gotta ask you something.

The NBA has to face reality.

What's happening to
these players is serious.

They're gonna need new
players with talent,

guys who are skilled, but never really
thought about a professional career before.

You think I got a shot?

Come on, really?

No.
Don't kid me.

Listen, it's a man's
game, and you can't play.

What if I tried really hard?

Can you keep it down? I'm
trying to hit this ball.

It's because I'm
white, isn't it?

No. Larry's white. So what?

Larry's not white,
Larry's clear.

Good shot, Larry.
That far?

Get inside of this ball.

Ooh, you
clowns can't beat that.

It's the best shot I ever hit.

Ugh, golf is so boring.

Well, of course it's boring.

The movie's got NBA players,
space aliens and the Looney Tunes.

If they made the scene any more exciting,
the audience's head would explode.

You feel that the NBA has
to face reality, don't you?

Just gotta start looking for
some more dominant players

in places they
never looked before.

Just look at the ball.

Visualize the shot
where you want it to go.

Right, right, right.

Be the ball.

Be the ball.
 Get off the tee.

Why?
 You can't jump.

I... Yeah. Go on.

Close to the pin.

Close to the
pin, for dinner?

 Sounds good.
 I'll go close to the pin.

 Okay.
I'll take some of that.

That's not bad.

It's a good shot.

Get down!

Look at that spin.

Hey. Since when are
golf balls magnetic?

Come on.

It is alive!

 My first hole in one. Yes!

 Oh!
 Don't say it.

You ever see this before?

Larry?

Nothing but the
bottom of the cup.

 Oh, God, that's his ball.
Yeah, yeah, it's my ball.

Sorry.
Wait, wait. Let me get a picture.

All right, here we go.
You're gonna smile.

You're reaching... You're reaching
for the ball and then you smile.

Okay?
Yes.

And you think this is good.

 Just take the picture!
All right, okay.

Uh-oh.

What kind
of camera is that?

Just a regular...
Would you not point that at me please?

And close the lens cap.
I didn't do anything...

Where'd he go?

Fun fact... The temperature at the
center of the Earth is 9,800 degrees.

No, no, no, no!

Oh, look out for that first
step, doc. It's a real lulu.

Bugs Bunny?

Eh, you were expecting
maybe the Easter Bunny?

You're a cartoon.
You're not real.

Not real, eh?

If I weren't real,
could I do this?

Ugh!

Oh, look. Is that Michael?

It's Michael!

Why is Sylvester in the sewer?

He's getting ready
to ambush Tweety.

Bah!

Okay, but why is
Taz in the mailbox?

Because Tasmanian devils are the
number one cause of mail tampering.

Come on, Raven. This
isn't rocket science.

Basketball!

Ooh! I thought I saw...

I did. I did see Michael Jordan.

Eh, pardon me, Mr. Jordan.

Can I have your...

Your John Hancock, please?

Back off! Let the
doctor take a look.

Woops!

A little high.

No.
Going down.

Woo-hoo!
 No!

Oh!

So... what do you say
we go for a little spin?

Yes.

Hmm.

Now, let's see what
we got inside here.

Say "ah".

All right.

He's okay!

What's going on here?

Why, Michael, I thought
you'd never ask.

You see, these aliens
come from outer space

and they want to make us
slaves in their theme park.

Eh, what do we care?

They're little. So we challenge
them to a basketball game.

But then they show up
and they ain't so little.

They're huge! We need
to beat these guys,

because they're
talking about slavery.

They're going to make
us do stand-up comedy,

the same jokes every
night for all eternity.

What's he whining about?

I know comedians who would
love that kind of job security.

Entertainment is indeed the
toughest of the businesses.

We're gonna be locked up like wild
animals and then trotted out to perform

for a bunch of low-brow, bug-eyed,
fat-headed, humor-challenged aliens!

Eh, what I'm trying to say is...

We need your help!

Yeah, but I'm a
baseball player now.

Right. And I'm a
Shakespearean actor.

Stop the movie!

If I laugh any harder,
I's gonna pee myself.

Oops.

That Bugs
Bunny is pretty loony.

You want to see loony?
We'll show you loony.

You guys want to watch
more of the movie?

Yeah!

Mike?

Michael, it's Stan.

It's Stan Podolak.

Look, I need you to
come out now, okay?

Because you've got a
baseball game tomorrow.

I'd look pretty stupid
if you don't show up.

You think Michael's all right?

Boy, I hate to
leave him like this.

I'm sure he's fine.

I think he just had to get
away from that Stan character.

Oh, God. He's
pathetic, isn't he?

Larry, I'm going to give
us both twos back there.

We weren't in any kind of emotional state to putt.
I think that's fair.

Yeah.

Come on, Larry Bird!
To the Batcave!

Look, I want to help, but I haven't
played basketball in a long time.

My timing's all off.

Eh, we'll fix your timing.

Look at our facilities.

We've got hoops.

We got weights.

We've got balls.

Whoa!

You sure do.

This place is a mess.

Mess? You're worried
about a little mess?

There's nothing here a little
spit-shine wouldn't fix.

Spit-shine!
Spit-shine!

Remember, kids,

when your parents tell you to clean your
room, just give it the old spit-shine.

Lemony fresh.

You guys are nuts.

Correction.
We're Looney Tunes.

And as such are the
exclusive property

and trademark of
Warner Bros Inc.

Ha-ha! Another butt!

Mmuah!

I'm here.

Me, too.

That hurt.

Who are these guys?

Well, uh, remember the tiny
aliens I told you about?

Oh.

You heard of the Dream Team?

Well, we're the Mean
Team, wussy man.

Wussy man.

"Wussy man"?
We're the Monstars!

M-O-N...

Let's see what you got, chump.

I don't play basketball anymore.

"I don't
play basketball anymore."

Maybe you're chicken.

I say, I resemble that remark.

You calling me chicken?

Hey, come here.

Whoa!

That's gonna give me nightmares.

Ooh! Watch the footwork.

Can you believe it?

Whoa!

Get out of the way!

Ah!

Hey, everybody!

Look at your hero now.

You guys are making
a big mistake.

You're all washed up...

Baldy.
"Baldy"?

He's not washed up.
Michael's the greatest ever.

Shut up.
Doh!

My poor little cranium.

You okay?

Yeah. Are you okay?

Hey!
Whoops.

You're not scared
of them, are you, Michael?

Let's play some basketball.

Yeah!

What do you doing?

I'm, uh... I'm fixing a divot.

Oh.

He's fixing a divot.

Fun fact... Schlesinger Gym was
named after Leon Schlesinger,

who was the original
producer of<i> The Looney Tunes,</i>

and the gym is modeled after
a Warner Brothers sound stage.

Has anyone here ever
played basketball?

Um, I have...

I'd like to try
out for the team.

Hey.

Hi. My name is Lola Bunny.

Lola?

Yes?

Hello.

Eh, my name is...
Bugs.

You wanna
play a little one-on-one, doll?

"Doll"?
Uh-huh.

On the court... Bugs.

Sure.

Oh, she's hot.

Ready?
Yes.

I got it, I got it...

The girl's got some skills.

Yes?

Don't ever call me "doll."

Indeed, she is not one of these

or these, or any of these.

Check.

Hey, nice playing with ya.

She's... leaving?

Yeah! Because one single basket
automatically gets you on the team.

Well, no wonder they
need Michael so bad.

<i>- Mais oui!</i>
Okay. Where's the ball?

Let's do some drills.
 Yeah, let's do that.

Can anyone lend me
a pair of sneakers?

Uh, sneakers?

 Oh.
Sowwy.

Someone's gonna have
to go to my house

and pick up my basketball gear.

To your house? In 3-D land?
 Yeah.

Would somebody get
this guy a mask? Ugh.

And whatever you do

don't forget my North
Carolina shorts.

 Your shorts? From college?
 Ooh-hoo.

I wore them under my Chicago
Bulls uniform every game.

So why can't Michael get
his own basketball shorts?

Beats me.

I too am the very lost.

I've seen this movie
a hundred times

and I still don't know
why he can't go back home.

Well, we were in the movie and
we don't even know the reason.

Well, we can go online, get
more information on the film.

Titans.
Can I have word with you?

Listen up. I think these aliens have
something sinister planned with this website.

Why else would it still be
around after all these years?

Because it's super
awesome. That's why.

But look! Jam Central.

They're probably using this
site to jam our computer,

so we can't call for help
when they try to replace us!

Stop being the paranoid, Robin.

Now let's figure out why
MJ can't go back home.

Hmm. Here we go.

It says here that Michael
had to join the Looney Tunes

because they
wouldn't let him go.

Oh, now I get it!

<i>In order to prevent themselves
from becoming prisoners,</i>

<i>the Looney Tunes had to
make Michael their prisoner.</i>

Oh, yeah! That makes
total sense, yo!

And look! It says here that
the Michael Jordan's lawyer

originally came up with
the idea for the<i> Space Jam.</i>

Well, if anyone knows
comedy, it's lawyers.

Okay, Titans. You
got your answer.

Now can we please get off this
website before something bad happens?

Not yet, bro. I want to play
some of them classic games.

I knew it!

This website is trying
to hack our computer!

Relax, dude.

The computer is probably just having
an issue with the outdated software.

We can't
take that risk!

We need to shut it down now!

Is he the dead?

Mm, no. He's still breathing.

Great! Let's get
back to the movie.

The
view back here stinks.

Whoa!

 Whoa! Oh, what?
We're right in front of Michael's house.

I knew that!

Okay, let's go in this way.

I say let's
go in that way!

He just never learns.

Now, let me see.

I must be very, very, close.

Mother!

Nice digs.

Well, well. I wonder
who that could be.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

Shh! Everyone's sleepin'!

I knew that.

Come on! Come on! We gotta find
Michael's basketball stuff.

Now, spread out and
search the place.

Yes,<i> sahib.</i>

Oh, brother!

Here I am, in the
peak of my form,

playin' second banana to some sort of a hare-brain.
Yap, yap, yap.

Hmm. This could be useful.

Ah-ha!

Michael must really love underwear
to keep it in his trophy room.

Oh! One of his shoes.

Nope. Nope. Nope.

Where is that other shoe?

Where are you?

Eureka!

Come to Papa.

Nothing to see here, kid. We're
just breaking and entering.

What a fuzz-foot.
You are so clumsy.

Catch, featherhead.
Thanks.

Well, time to go.

Did we get everything?

The shorts!

In there?

Okay, I'll check.

I found... the shorts.

Whoa!

The pain!

I'm right behind ya, pal.

Eh, that's
none too reassuring.

Nice puppy.

How's about a bone?

No dice.

What about a nice holiday ham?

He ain't buyin' it.

Can't we talk this over, Rover?
Down, Beethoven!

Ooh! The kids are here.

Give it to me, Charles.

Here you go, Bugs.
Yeah! Thanks, kid.

Shoo! Shoo!

Bad dog!

That is the last time I'm ever
working with dogs or children!

 Bye-bye!
 Hey, where're you going?

Well, uh, you see,

the Looney Tunes have a big
basketball game comin' up,

and, uh, your dad's gonna play.

All right!

Yeah! But don't tell anybody.

Isn't it weird that these
kids have, like, no reaction

to an animated rabbit
and duck in their house?

No, Raven. There's nothing weird about
seein' a bunch of cartoon characters

stealing your dad's stuff and then
telling you not to say anything about it!

This is it!
This is it!

I don't know where
you are, Michael,

but wherever you are, you
obviously enjoy being there!

More than spendin' time with me!

You better hope this
Jordan character

still knows how to play hoops.

You and me both, brudduh.

Listen, how's
this for a new team name,

"The Ducks!"

Please!

What kind of Mickey
Mouse organization

would name their
team, "The Ducks?"

So sue me.
It's just a suggestion.

<i>You're doin' it!</i>

<i>You're becoming mighty! Go!</i>

Come
on, guys. No pain, no gain.

Ha! That's two more butts!

<i>I don't
hear it! What is it?</i>

 Come on!
<i>- Now shake it, - keep on sweating!</i>

Eh, guys?

Yeah?

Look who's finally
ready to play!

Let's see if I remember
how to do this.

Yes!

Michael!

Is it really you?

Oh!  Thank God,
you're all right! You're all right!

Oh-ho-ho. I was so worried.

Come on, Stan. Don't
hug me, please.

Sorry.
What are you doin' here?

I gotta take you back.
You've got baseball practice.

I can't. I'm helpin' my friends
in their basketball game.

Let me get this straight...

First, Michael quits the NBA
to play Minor League baseball.

Now he's quitting baseball to
play cartoon basketball for free?

Yup! His career is really
going places in this film!

If it doesn't bother you,
it doesn't bother me.

I mean... Let me help! Let me help! I
could help! I can help! Let me help!

What can you do?

Well, you know, I mean...
I may not be very tall,

but I'm slow.

And large.
And a dork.

I'll do anything,
Michael! Anything!

Anything?
Anything.

Come here. Come
here for a second.

Sit right here.
 Okay.

Okay, no problem.

All right! All right.
Let's go, team!

You know, if somebody gets injured,
we could see a lot of minutes.

I'm a cheerleader.

Holds up.

So the big game takes
place in Looney Tunes land?

Yeah, so?

So, why'd they call
this movie <i>Space Jam?</i>

When the Jam doesn't
take place in space?

Because "Looney Tunes Land In
The Middle Of The Planet Jam"

doesn't have a nice
ring to it, Raven.

Yes!

Butt shot!

Just get out of my way.

Ready?
 Yes!

Let's go.

Okey-doke. Ready to go?

Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

Riot!

Ladies and gentlemen

the starting lineup for...

The Tune Squad!

<i>Standing two-foot-four,</i>

<i>The Wonder From Down Under...</i>

<i>The Tasmanian Devil!</i>

<i> At small forward,</i>

<i>standing a scintillating
three-foot-two...</i>

<i>the "Heartthrob of the Hoops,".</i>

<i>Lola Bunny!</i>

<i> At power forward,</i>

<i>the "Quackster of the
Courts," Daffy Duck!</i>

Thank you. Thank you!

Very funny. Let's all
laugh at the duck.

<i> And at Point Guard,</i>

standing three-foot-three

four feet if you
include the ears...

<i>Co-captain of the Tune Squad...
"The Doctor of Delight,".</i>

<i>- Bugs Bunny!</i>
Thank you! Thank you!

And now

the player-coach
of the Tune Squad

at six-foot-six
from North Carolina,

his Royal Airness,

Michael Jordan!

Who? Is he a Looney Tune?

Uh... Well...  Perhaps.

You guys ready?

I'm set to take it
to the rack, Jack.

Those Monstars'll wish
they'd never been born!

Guys, let's just go out and have fun.
 Yeah!

<i> The challengers
for the Ultimate Game</i>

<i>all the way from Moron Mountain.</i>

Oh, come on! More introductions?

Relax, girl!

They're getting folks
hyped up for the game!

Yeah!

Go, Monstars! Go,
Monstars! Go, Monstars! Go, go!

What are you looking at?

Cool shoes.

Uh. Ugh.

Ready?

I got it, I got it, I got it.
I got the ball. I got the ball.

Coming
through, little boys.

Who do they think they
are, the Detroit Pistons?

Thank you.

Yes!

Way to go, boys.

Did you see the
moves on that one?

Come on, come
on, show me somethin'.

What you got? Come
on, show me somethin'.

You ain't got no hands.

 Huh?
 Whoops.

The duck!

Yo, D-up
on the duck, man.

Yeah!

 Oh.

This game is out of control, yo.

Call the Commissioner
Gordon. Call him!

Oh, my.

She was wide open.

Come on, baby.
I'm open, I'm open.

Hit me up, hit me up.
School's open, baby.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah!

Ha!

Watch the screen!
Watch the screen! Watch him!

Coming your way,
coming your way.

Hey, man, I'm gonna
make him do something.

Get him!

Wait. The Monstars
are up now by six

and we're in the second
period? How'd that happen?

Because this is
the Ultimate Game.

It transcends space and time.

And apparently logic, too.

Nice shot, Mr. J.

Hey, hey, hey, come on. Come
on. Get back on defense.

Way to go!

MJ! MJ!

Red light.

Feed me! Feed me!

Feed you? Feed me!

 Oops. Uh-oh.

Bad little putty tat!

I'll take
that, thank you.

Here, don't try this at home!

Wai...
You goin' somewhere?

May I remind you, sir,

that physical violence is
patently against the rules?

Yeow!

Did you order original
recipe or extra crispy?

Let's go. Come on.
Me?

Oh. Boy. I'm ready. I can do this.
Mouse?

You picked the mouse?

I love basketball.
I've always loved basketball.

Do you love basketball?
 Uh-huh.

You're big. I bet you're good at basketball.
 Right.

I'm small, but I'll
try really, really hard

to be good at basketball.
Okay.

Really I will. I always try hard.
Yeah.

My mom says "Try your best
in everything you do..."

Try to get by me, doll.
"Doll?"

Whoa!

You go, girl.

Don't ever call me...

"Doll."

She is not the consumer product!

Nice shot.
Thanks, Bugs.

Hmm? Where's your defense, boy?

I got you right here.

Call nine-one-one!

Piece of pie? Pork chop?

Some sorbet, perhaps?
 Yeah!

Half-time.

Holey putty tat.

 We're better than them.
 Yeah, man.

We got it goin'
on. One more half

and we're on our way, man.
 We got 'em, boys.

Moron Mountain, here we come.

We're
gonna be slaves.

Come on. Guys.
Keep your head up.

Got whole another half to play.

It's the boss.

Hello, Mr. Swackhammer.

All right.

Not bad for the first half,
but we gotta keep this up.

Hey, no problem.

We stole the...
We stole the talent, boss

from the best
players in the NBA.

From the NBA?

And it was little, uh,
uh, uh, grand-mama.

What was it, Larry Johnson?
Shut up!

I smell something.

It's probably all that
nasty cigar smoke.

We have been
playing really hard.

 Yeah.
Not you, you idiot.

It's coming from over here.

 That locker!

Yeah!

Look!

It's the chubby boy.

Ah.

It smells like a spy.

You guys
need a publicist?

I can make you big.
<i> Look.</i>

I know we're down.
 Oh, yeah, let's hear the story.

But I've been in this
situation many times before.

 Oh, this is a piece of work.
We can still win this thing.

It's not over with. We gotta come together.

 Oh, yeah.
We gotta believe in ourselves.

We can come back
and win this game.

Yeah, right.
That's gonna help us.

Looks
like Stan just had

a close encounter
with a bug-zapper.

The Monstars.
The Monstars!

 Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
 You all right, Stan?

The Monstars.

The Monstars

stole the talent
from the NBA players.

So that's what
happened to those guys.

I think
we should forfeit.

 Yeah.
Listen.

I didn't get dragged down here

just to get my butt whipped
by a bunch of ugly Monstars.

I ain't goin' out like that.

We're lettin' 'em
push us around.

We gotta
fight 'em back.

We gotta take it to them.

We gotta get right
in their faces.

What do you say?

Are you with me or not?

Eh, finished? Eh, great
speech an' all, doc.

Eh, you had 'em riveted.

But, er, didn't you forget somethin'?
What?

Your secret stuff.

Wow.

 Whoa! Nice deltoids.
Play along.

Eh, stop hogging it, Mike.
We're your teammates.

Secwet stuff?

Secret Stuff?

You wouldn't hold
out on us, would you?

No, I mean, I didn't think
you guys really needed it.

I mean, you're so tough.
You're competitive.

We're also chicken,
son. We need it bad.

Hey!
Can I have a little drink?

I'd like some of that.

If I could just...
 Yeah. Can I have a sip, please?

You know,
this goes against

everything they taught
me in health class.

Do you wanna win or not?

Bottoms up.

Yummy.

All right. How about we go out
and kick some alien butt, huh?

Let's go! How about
it, huh? Ready?

Yeah.

Let's go!

Check out all those classic
Looney Tunes characters.

There's lady head turtle body.

And the chicken feet man.

Whoa, this whole
crowd is freaky, yo.

Looks like them animators just

copy-and-pasted these
fools over and over.

I never
noticed that before.

This weirdo is over here,
here, here, and here.

And these cats, and
this guy, and her?

This is crazy, man!

Okay. Okay. Sorry.
Back to the movie.

I'm open!

 Coming through.
Hey.

Bugs.

Special delivery.

 Great!

Whoa! Boo.

Eh, nice kaboom, Wile E.

Again with the guns?

Don't worry, Mom and Dad.
I'll take care of it.

 Let's teach them a lesson.
 Ah, man.

Hey...

Oh, man, look at that one.

Nice butt!

Dunk.

You ain't
going anywhere, chump.

Hey!

 Er, going up.
 You're mine, boy! Ooh.

Slammy!
 Yes!

Hello!

Cyborg's fun fact.

Pepe Le Pew was originally
named, "Stinky."

Hey, he shares the
same nickname as Robin.

Two points.

Ooh,
this will be good.

Yo, check out that butt!

Okay, birdie.
Uh-oh.

I'm gonna step
outside for a minute

to get some fresh air.
Cyborg, you should join me.

No, thanks. I'm good.

Ow!
It wasn't a question.

Okay, okay.

Here's the plan. I'm
going to search their ship

while you be on the lookout.
Fine.

What are you doing? You're
supposed to be on the lookout.

Yeah, and I'm looking out to see
what's inside this cool spaceship.

Fine. Then help me search
for clues that will expose

what these aliens are planning.

They're not planning
anything, dude.

All that's in here is
stuff from the movie.

Aha!

Perhaps their secret lies in
this bottle of secret stuff!

I wouldn't do that.

That water has been in
there for like 25 years.

There's a secret in
here. You'll see!

Must get to secret.

Okay. But I wonder
what's behind this door.

Wait. It says "Do not open."

Because they're obviously
hiding something.

You were right!

Ow! Ow! Ow!

I was right.

Will you give it up, dude?
They're not hiding anything.

Then what about this
examination chair?

I'm sure they're
planning to use this

to perform weird
experiments on us,

like replacing our bodies.
No, man.

That's just Daffy's chair. See?

Ain't I a stinker?

Oh, good. They're back.

Now we can watch
more of the movie.

All right, guys, we're
right back in this game.

Come on, now, let's play some tough defense.

Why didn't you get this guy?

He's a baseball player.

Yeah, boss, a baseball player.

Looks like a basketball
player to me.

Yeah, me too.

Shh! He's the one I
want for Moron Mountain.

Hey.

Are you talkin' to me?

Yeah I'm talkin' to you.
You want a piece of me?

Come and get it.

Uh-oh!

What did you have in mind?

What about we raise the
stakes a little bit?

Mm-hmm.

Interesting.

Gross!

He just blew secondhand smoke
in Michael Jordan's face!

He is the worst of
all the villains.

If we win

you give the NBA players
their talent back.

But what if we win?

If you win?
 Uh-huh.

You get me.

Good deal, boss.

 I like that!
Eh, doc

you think that's a good ide...

<i> You'll be
our star attraction...</i>

<i>You'll sign autographs
all day long.</i>

<i>And play one-on-one with
the paying customers.</i>

How does he expect
Michael to sign autographs

and play basketball
at the same time.

Really? You're still
asking questions, girl?

Don't you know by now that
none of this makes sense?

It's Looney! Looney!

Deal.

 All right!
 Yeah!

The boss
don't playin' do he?

I don't think you should
have done that, doc.

I have faith in my team.

Crush 'em!

It's feedin'
time, boys!

Ye-ga, er,
ba-bee, er, ba-bee...

There's butts number
nine and ten, yo!

I'll tell you brother,
this match is gettin' ugly!

Oh, yeah! There's
a chop to the head!

A body slam!

Another chop! A kick!

It's not looking good for
the Tune Squad, brother!

But Mommy, I don't want
to go to school today.

I want to stay home and
bake cookies with you.

 This is gonna be fun!
 I'm open! I'm open!

Lola! Lola! Heads up!

 Oh!
 Belly flop!

This butt fills
half the screen, yo!

Oh, my! Bugs!

Bugs!
Is this your man?

Are you okay?

Me? Oh, yeah, I'm
fine. Are you okay?

Oh, Bugs... thank you.

Oh... it was nothin'!

That was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

I need a break from all of
this intense sports action.

You ain't kidding, mama.

All this suspense
over who's gonna win

has got my tummy tied in knots.

I know how it ends and
I'm still feeling anxious.

Dude, bad vibes.

I know what will
calm those nerves.

Snack time, baby!

Help yourself to
whatever you want.

Now, this is mine!

Mmm, peanut butter.

Here we go.

Can you reach those
chips for me, please?

Get it yourself.

But you're so tall and
your hands are so big.

Really? You mean it?

You're also a strong leader.

And we can appreciate someone

who forces others to
act against their will.

You would make a great Nerdluck.

Wow! You really mean that?

 Yeah, totally.
 Oooh, you'd be great.

Did you hear that, Titans?

Whatever.

You know what?

Maybe you aliens aren't
so bad after all.

Told you there was
nothing to worry about.

Now let's get back to the movie!

I could have
been a contender!

The Monstars!
The Monstars!

Clear!

Okay. We need a fifth player.

Hey, Coach, listen.

You got anymore of
that secret stuff?

I think it's
startin' to wear off.

It didn't wear off.
It was just water.

You guys had the "special
stuff" inside of you all along.

Yeah. Yeah. I-I knew that.

But, listen, you got any more?

 Yah, I'll get a double one.
 Can I have some too?

Stan?
Yeah! Eh, m-me?

You're in at center.

Just guard the big guy, okay?

Guard him? Guard him? Guard
him? I'll smother him!

I'll be all over him
like a cheap suit!

I'll be on him
like stink on rice!

I tell you, he's goin' down!

Michael, over here! Over here!

Over here, I'm open! I'm open!

Come on! Come on!

Now, you got
it! Get the fat one.

Yes!

Ah-ha! Nice shot!

Big man pancake.

Haha! Look they made
a "Flat Stanley."

Let's
get him outta here!

Eww!

Oh, my!

How'd he do that?

Oh, anybody could do that, doc.

Even you. Watch this.

Watch this.

See? No sweat.

This is Looney Tune Land.

Ten seconds to go? Thanks
for tellin' me... doc.

I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, Your Airness,

but if you don't
find a fifth player,

your team will forfeit the game.

Now the rules apply?
Forfeit?

Precisely, Sir Altitude.

No way. We'll find someone.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

I didn't know Dan Ackroyd
was in this picture!

Hey!

Perhaps I could be
of some assistance.

That's our fifth guy.

Let's go. Now you get to
live up your dream. Let's go.

All right.

All right. We need to score two points...
Here's how I see it.

Duck...
Yes?

You kick it in to
the girl bunny...

Yeah?
Down in the post.

You dish it back out
to the guy bunny.

Got it!
You swing it around to Mike over here.

Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.
You go to the hole and dominate!

We're on defense.
 Oh, yeah.

Whoa, ho-ho.
I don't play defense.

Typical.
All right, you're gonna have to listen to Mike on this.

Listen up.
Somebody steal the ball,

get it to me, and I'll score
before the time runs out.

Don't lose that confidence! Okay!
I won't. All right.

Paws and wings in
here! All right!

Let's go.

This is why I was born.
I thrive on pressure.

Excuse me? Uh, uh, s-sorry!

Yo, yo, yo. Yo. Easy on the
trousers, Daf. Easy, man. Easy.

Pardon me. Uhm, Mr. Murray,

something's really
been buggin' me.

Yeah?
Just how did you get here, anyway?

Producer's a friend of mine.

Just had a teamster come
and drop me off, you know.

Uh-huh. Well,
that's how it goes.

Hey, you see this, uh, kind
of chunky fellow over here?

Uh-huh.

Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh,
that's good! Oh, yes!

All right, let's do
it! You the duck!

Now, let's all play
fair. Here.

Yo, spaceman, don't choke
now! Come on, come on.

 Come on. Come on. Come on!
It's gut check time!

This must be mine.

Whoaho-ho!

This belongs to me.
I'm goin' this way.

I'm goin' left! I'm goin' left!
Look left! Look left! Yes!

Whoa-ho-ho! Don't ever
trust an Earthling!

What'cha got?

Mike!

Get the
rabbit! Get the girl!

Come on! Come on! I'm open!

I'm o...!

That's mine!
Not today!

 Hey!
 Come on! Ohh!

Bring it on, dude.

Whoopsie daisy! Woo-hoo!

You're mine!

Number twelve with the assist!

Mike, I'm open!

Never mind.

The Tunes win!!

This proves once again that
Michael Jordan is the solution

to all of life's problems!

That was a great stretch
for the basket too.

You know, you really
got some skills.

You might be able
to play in the NBA.

Thanks, Mike. I'll
probably quote you on that.

But I'm gonna take
this opportunity

to retire from the
game of basketball.

No, come on. Man.
No.

No, I'm gonna retire right now
and that's all there is to it.

I'm gonna go out on top,
undefeated and untied.

That's the way it's gonna be.

You go on ahead and celebrate
with your teammates and...

No, come and help us,
man. Celebrate with us.

No, I-I-I'd like to, but I have to
ice down my knees right away, okay?

They're startin' to go.

All right. Good-bye, man.
All right. See you.

Are you sure?

Yes. Definitely
sure. Definitely.

And the best part of the movie has left
the building, ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you, Bill Murray.
You're a national treasure.

Losers!
 Sorry.

Choke artists!

He's the real choke artist!

Makin' everyone choke on
that nasty smoke like that.

Mm-hmm. That ain't right.

The party's over!
Get in the spaceship.

Why do you take
it from this guy?

Because he's bigger.

He's bigger...

Than we used to be.

Right!

What are you doing?

Ooooooooh!

Hey! Wait!
Come here!

What are you doing? Wait!

No! What? Hey! Let
me go!

Had it in ya all the
time, didn't you?

One thing, though.
Pass me the ball, Bugs.

You gotta give my friends
their talent back.

Oops.

Do we have to?
Yeah.

Yeah.
It was part of the deal. Touch the ball.

Oh, okay.

Uh, fair is fair.

There you go. Touch it.

That was so much fun.

I feel so... insignificant.

My clothes don't fit.

What a trip.
 I'm up for another one.

Michael! Do you know
what time it is?

Se-seven
fiftee... Seven fifteen,

quarter past seven.

Exactly. You've got a
baseball game in five minutes.

Okay. Take this.

Is it safe?

Yeah. Put in my bag.

It's kind of...

I really enjoyed
playing with you guys.

You guys got a lot of, uh...
 Uh-huh?

A lot of, uh...
 Yes?

Well, whatever it is,
you got a lot of it.

Well, gotta go.

Bugs?
Eh, Mike?

Stay outta trouble.
You know I will.

Come here!

Ohh!

Ah-hoo, hoo, hoo!

Wow! What a great movie!

You were right, Titans.

They didn't come
here to replace us.

Yes, we did.
What?

Why do you think
we were so eager

to watch the movie with you?

We thought you guys
just wanted to hang.

No. What we wanted
was your powers.

And we can't believe
you just gave 'em to us.

We heard you Titans
were dummies.

But we didn't realize
you were that dumb.

Yeah. Stupid.

Okay. You've had your fun.

Now give us back our powers.

You got it!

We're the Titans now!

Where are we?

Is it just me or does
this place look familiar?

See!

I knew those aliens
couldn't be trusted!

Well, that's all, folks!

Eh, be-eh that's my
line. Eh, be-eh that's...

Step aside, babe.

Let a star do this.

That's all... Whoa!

That's all, folks!

Can I go home now?
