Binh!

We should get married.
Our ages are well-matched.

You want someone
to make you dinner every day.

That was the idea.

What do I get out of it?

It will be a good arrangement.

I will be like a father to your children.

Everyone will have enough to eat,
even pig face here.

Why is he so grouchy?

If you marry me, I'll fix up the house.

You have to clean it!

Hurry!

I need it tonight.

Come!

Hurry! The celebration starts soon!

...since the liberation, significant progress
has been made in the spirit of Ho Chi Minh.

Will you marry Pham?

Who knows?

What did my mother say about the GI?

Your father?

Yes.

Why do you ask now?

She must have said something.
She cried about him.

That's all?

He had very big feet.

First, he tracks dirt all over the house...

then he takes off his leather shoes.

He puts up his big feet
so that everyone can see.

Is she alive?

If she marries Pham...

there won't be room for you.

She is alive.

In the big city.

Why are you always angry with him?
I can't bear the sight of him.

He's not one of us. I don't know why
he doesn't go to where he belongs.

And for my forefathers,
I pray for their souls...

and that we someday will be united.

For myself, I ask that my actions
will not harm others.

I do not leave with a bitter heart...

but with hope that I will have a better future.

You're Bui Doi, aren't you?

Go home. There's nothing for you here.

Consider yourself lucky.

I'm looking for Mai.

She used to work here.

She's my mother.

Does Mai live here?

Go away, beggar!

I know you.

You are very big, my brother.

Where is Mother?

She's at work...

in the big house.

If you have a problem,
don't bother our guests with it.

Mai! You don't work
in the dining room anymore.

Give me your uniform. Hurry.

Good evening. Do you know who I am?

It's me.

It's Binh.

I am so sorry, my son.

Mai.

Will you wait?

Thank you.

You're hungry?

What are you thinking?

I am thinking...

that I don't know you.

You know, we were married...

in a church.

He was Christian?

He never said...

but he wanted a priest.

Where is he? What happened to him?

He was here one day...

then he was gone.

Just like that.

Killed?

He was just gone.

It was a hard time for everyone.

Madam, if you have a moment.

It's her son.

He will be a good worker...

alongside her...

to replace the houseboy.

Far greater value than what you pay now.

Let me look at you.

Your mother is attractive.
How did you get to be so ugly?

I know you are generous, madam.

I know that you know
what it means to love a son, and...

He will shine my son's shoes.

The rugs need beating.
He can assist his mother in that.

And the fence has to be painted.

Work hard. Help your mother.

She's suffered a lot because of you.

Working hard?

Let me give you a hand.

Please, no. I must finish,
or your mother will be angry.

Is he Tam's father?

How dare you ask me that?

You were gone a long time.
I'm sorry.

Quiet!

You have shortchanged me.
No.

First he steals from me, then he lies.

That's what you get
for bringing such trash into the house!

I don't know how to protect you.

I have shamed you. I'll go back to Hoa Nam.

No. I'm proud of you.

Just stay out of his way.

Binh, help me.

Careful!

Put that down!

Thief! Bastard thief!

You must take Tam as well.

Come with us, Mother!
No.

I have a friend.
He knows of boats, special boats.

It will just be enough for the two of you.

This is my wedding certificate.

On it is an address in Houston, Texas.

He may help, but ask for nothing.

Keep a good heart.

Don't let Tam forget me.

You're going to go on a trip with Binh.

Mama, where will you be?

I'll come. Just not now.

Do what Binh says.

Mother will be along soon.
We'll all be together in America.

Where you going?

What will you do there?

Sell shoes. Everyone needs shoes.

You have family there?

You have family there?

He's not Vietnamese.

He's a big American.

Tam, come here!

Where were you going?

Where were you going?

Nobody tries for Malaysia.

America is a nice place.

Have you been in prison before
for political reasons?

For criminal reasons?

Was your father American?

He Vietnamese.
Open your mouth.

What is his name?
Duc.

You can put your shirt on.

Why do you leave Vietnam?

It's to your benefit to tell the truth.

Come.

Don't worry. Be here when you get back...

just like everyone else.

I'll be back soon.

You grow wings, you can fly over the wall.

Or you can like Ling.
Ling go over wall on her back.

Oh, thank you.

She can buy her way out!

If I could, I would.

But, you know, I'm not pretty like her.
