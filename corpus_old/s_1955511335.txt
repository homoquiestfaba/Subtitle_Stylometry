It's freezing.

You all right?

ADDIE (OFFSCREEN): What?

I'm finished.

So I can leave?

That's your response.

I just thought we could,
um, celebrate.

[music playing]

Why is it we didn't
do this more?

Because I was working.

You mean fucking?

No.

While I was pregnant, and you
dragged me away from my home

in the city, and you just put me
in this fake fucking house.

You thought, keep you from
being a one hit wonder.

Stop.

Jonathan.

With a fucking pond.

ADDIE (OFFSCREEN): Let's
see a big smile!

THOMAS (OFFSCREEN): I want
to talk to daddy.

ADDIE (OFFSCREEN): You want
to talk to daddy?

OK.

Where's daddy?

THOMAS (OFFSCREEN):
Over there.

ADDIE (OFFSCREEN): And say it,
look at me in the eyes.

There you go. Look
at me. Perfect.

My back.

You want me to see your back?

Yeah!

Look out below!

Let's see.

What's this?

What is that?

I love you, mommy.

ADDIE (OFFSCREEN): Put your arms
up like you're flying.

Come on.

Let's go.

Ready?

Come with me.

There we go.

Good job.


[wind blowing]




What are you doing?


What is that?

I don't know.

It's...

It's probably just the wind
or something, baby.

Just stay in bed.

No.

I'm coming with you.



Who is that?

I don't know.

Just stay up there.

Stay back there.


Wait, wait, wait!

What?

Here, can you just
take this, please?

Just put that down.

I'm not answering the
door with a gun.

Hi.

Are you OK?

There's someone out there.

Who?

Who's... who's out there?

I'm sorry, my phone
doesn't work.

Can I please just come
in right now?

Yeah, come on in, come
on in in, come on in.

It's OK.

It's fine.

I, I was just driving.

I live down the street.

Are you hurt?

No, I think I'm OK.

OK, what's your name?

Rachel.

My name's Rachel.

Rachel, I'm Jonathan.

This is my wife, Addie.

No!

It's OK, he's, um, just
going to look out.

Yeah, there's...

There's nobody out there.

Are you sure?

I'm positive.

Take your coat off.

Take her inside.

Here, come here.

OK.

I'm really sorry.

I'm really...

It's OK.

No.

Oh, god.

So, what exactly,
uh, happened?

I don't know.

I got a flat, and
I pulled over.

And there was like, this
weird clicking noise.

And I saw a man wearing
a gas mask.

I thought there was just one
of them, and then I looked,

and there were more.

More what?

More masks.


MAN ON PHONE: County
Sheriff's Office.

Hello, this is Jonathan Dade.

MAN ON PHONE: Can I help you?

Can you hear me?

MAN ON PHONE: Hello?

H-hello.

MAN ON PHONE: Hello,
is there anybody...

I need you to send
someone down to...

MAN ON PHONE: Sounds like we
have a bad connection.

Hello?

Don't you have a cell phone?

No, we... we don't really
get reception down here.

Hey.

You're gonna be fine.

It's probably just the
neighbor's kids, or something.

Look, I'll go check it out.

What?

It's OK.

Jesus.

This thing only works...

Where'd you say your car was?

Just down the road.

OK.

Be right back.

Just stay right there.

Wait. Jonathan.

What?

You're not gonna leave me
alone with her, are you?

Addie, it's fine.

She's harmless.

Yeah, but we don't know that.

And what about the, uh, the...

Masks?

Masks.

Oh, come on. It's probably
the Millers' kids.

Look, I'll go scare 'em.

Hey, you know the combination
to the safe in my office?

You do, I knew it.

So you know where the real gun
is in case I don't come back.

I'm gonna be fine.

Be careful.

Please.

Lock the door.

Can I...

Can I get you some tea,
or something?

Yes.

Yes, please.

Thank you.

I really am sorry
about all this.

Oh, that's, uh...

That's OK.

I know how creepy it can
get here at night.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

I hope I didn't wake him.

What's his name?

Where...

Where...

Where did you say that
you were from?

Rachel?

Rachel?

Hello?

Rachel?

Hello?


Anyone there?

[glass shattering]

Shoot.


He looks just like you.

Really?

Definitely.

That's funny.

Everyone always said that
he looked like Jonathan.

Sorry.

This shouldn't have
been there.

Is that his new book?

You...

You know who he is?

Well, yeah.

Doesn't everybody?

It must be so cool to be married
to somebody famous.

You'd think.

What's it about?

I can't say.

[kettle whistling]

Why not?

[door closing]

Oh!

Here, let me help you.

No, no, no.

Don't touch it.

I've got it!

[kettle whistling]

JONATHAN (OFFSCREEN):
What's going on?

You guys all right?

Hey.

[kettle whistling]

You...

So...

What is that?

This was stuck in your tires.

Whoa, are you all right?

Let me see that.

She's fine.

Um, uh, we should
clean that up.

Did you see anything
out there?

No, just a bunch
of beer bottles.

Uh, can you get some
bandaids, please?

Yeah.

I think there's some peroxide
in here somewhere.

Rachel, let me see your hand.

Sit down.

Where are the bandaids?

Couldn't find them.

Oh, she...

This is probably going to
sting a little bit.

It's nothing, really.

I'm so sorry.

Hm?

It's all right.

No, I mean...

What?

You don't have to
pretend anymore.

Occupational hazard.

I know what happened.

To Thomas.

I'm sorry.

Oh.

Well, I'm, uh, surprised
she told you his name.

RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Maybe
she's trying to move on.

JONATHAN (OFFSCREEN):
Or move out.

RACHEL (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, I didn't...

I didn't know that
it was like that.

No, no, no.

She's, she's just...

Well, it's hard, you know?

I mean, he really was just
an amazing person.

And I know everybody says that
about their own kid, but, I

mean, you should have seen
Addie and him together.

They were...

She...

She just used to be
the happiest.

Maybe there's a way to move
on without letting go.

I hope...

I hope I haven't overstepped
anything.

No, it's...

It's just good to talk about it.

You know, the day that
he drowned...

Thank you.

Now, uh, why don't
we take you home?

Sorry, it's just that there's
nobody home at my house right

now, and I really don't want
to be a burden, but after

tonight, the thought of being
alone in the house is just

terrifying.

Can I please just stay here
until the morning?

Sure.

It's fine.

It's fine.

Thank you.

There are, uh, there's blankets
in the closet,

there's towels under the sink.

And well, I guess you already
know where the kitchen is.

I do.

We'll see you in the morning.

See you in the morning.

Night.

How could you do that?

How could I do what?

Who is she?

She's our neighbor.

Then how come we haven't seen
her around the neighborhood?

Because we never
leave the house.

Did you really find her car?

What are you talking about?

She's a fan, John.

What?

She's a fucking fan.

She knows who you are.

So?

What if she made all
this shit up?

She's just a kid.

What if you already
fucked her?

Stop.

Just stop.

I just heard my husband share
the most intimate details of

our lives to a total
fucking stranger.

It could be a lie.

I wouldn't have to stare
at myself, wishing...

[muffled voices]

Sorry.

Hey, I'm sorry.

OK?

I don't like her.

I hate her.

[music playing]

[music playing]

[music grows louder]

[music playing]

[music playing]

[music becomes quieter]

[music playing]

[music playing]

Rachel?

[water running]

[music stops]

[music stops]

Addie.

Ad.

Ad, come on.

I...

Hey, you OK?

Addie.

OK?

You don't...

You don't hear that?

Hear what?

Ad...









She's not here.

What were you doing
Thomas' room?

Nothing, I was just getting
my backpack out.

Oh bullshit.

You put this upstairs.

Why?

I didn't...

Why?

I don't know what you're
talking about.

All right, that's it.

JONATHAN (OFFSCREEN): Hey.

Here.

What were you doing in here?

Addie, just...

No!

No.

What were you doing in here?

Nothing, I swear.

It's them.

It's them.

I know it's them.

JONATHAN (OFFSCREEN): It's
probably just a fuse, OK?

I'll go check the box.

You have to call someone.

It's just a fuse.


See?

It was a fuse.

No!

No!

Rachel!


Rachel!

Jonathan!

Help!

Rachel!

Oh my god.

Oh my god.

What the fuck is happening?

Shit.

Wait, wait.

We can't leave her, I...

John.

John.

We have to help her.

Look.

We're going to go into
my office, OK?

We're going to go
into my office.

I'm going to get the gun.

Come on, come on.

Is anyone there?

No.

No one's there.

Oh my god!

Go back. Go back.

In the car.

Shit. Shit.

Go, go, go.

Upstairs. Come on.

Shit.

Shh.

Sh sh sh.

It's OK.

It's OK.

What are you doing?

I'm going to go get the gun.

No.

No.

Lock the doors behind me.

Lock the doors behind me.

[water dripping]



Jonathan?

Jonathan?

[door rattling]

ADDIE (OFFSCREEN): Wanna show
me something over there?

OK, show me.

Let's walk together.

I'm following you.

You're in charge.


The gun.

[glass cracking]

Addie?

Addie, open the door.

Jonathan.

Addie, open the door.

Addie, open the door.

Addie, open the door!

Come on Addie.

Open the fucking door!

No!

Hurry up, Addie.

Open the door!

Shit.

Oh shit.

What happened?

Did they do this to you?

What do you want?

Baby, what happened?

I stepped on the glass.

Shit.

We just gotta get your
shoe off, OK?

Oh my god.

Why are they doing this?

I don't know.

I don't know.

Just breathe.

It's gonna be OK.

You're gonna be OK.

All right?

Promise.

It's OK.

We just gotta get your
shoe back on.

OK.

OK.

OK.

Did you take the gun?

Hey!

Did you take the gun?

No!

OK, come on.

Get up.

I got you.

I got you.

OK, sit down.

Sit down right here.

OK.

Just stay right there.

Fuck.

OK.

OK.

I need you to stay here.

What?

Take this.

No, no.

Stop, stop, stop.

Take this.

Stop, stop.

I need to...

I need to make sure we
can get to the car.

No, please.

OK?

You're gonna be safe
right here.

Don't leave, please
don't leave me.

No, it's OK.

You'll be fine.

Listen.

Listen to me, I'm going
to get us out of this.

No, please.

Please don't leave me.

We're gonna get through
this together.

OK.

Promise.

OK.

OK, please hurry.

Oh.

Shit.








Jonathan.

Jonathan.

Get down!

Come on.

Come on.

What?

Oh my god.

Did you see that?

Shit.

OK.

I'll try and do something.

You stay inside.

Go ahead and try it. Try.

[engine stalling]

Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

OK, try it again.

[engine stalling]


Jonathan?


Come on.

Come on.

Come on.

Come on.

Get up.

Come on.

Come on.

Get your arm up.

Come on.

Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.



It's OK. It's OK.

He's gone.

He's gone.

He's gone.

It was Rachel.

What?

In the garage.

It was Rachel.

What are you talking about?

Are you saying she
was one of them?

Yeah.

Oh my god.

None of this makes any sense.

Oh my god.

Come on.

Wait.

Are you crazy?

Look, we need to find
out what is going on.

OK? Come on.

No.

Come on.

OK.

Come on.

What the fuck?


Oh my god.

Jonathan.

They've been watching us.

Shh.

Hey.

Rachel's down.

Grab another mask...

Because we need it.

I can't believe you let
her into our house.

What?

And you told her about us.

I had to talk to somebody.

Then talk to me.

You're too fucked up on booze
to talk about anything.

If you wouldn't have dragged
us away from the city, I

wouldn't have had to bury
myself with him.

What, in the cellar?

I saw it, Addie.

I fucking saw it.

You want to know why I
can't talk about him?

Because I was there, Jonathan.

I put him down, I turned on that
fucking monitor, I looked

up, and then he was gone.

I went into the water, I pulled
him out, but I was too

fucking late.

You were supposed to
be watching him.

Do you think...

Do you really think that you're
the only one going

through this?

This happened to me, too.

I lost my son too.

You think I don't want
more time with him?

More time with us?

I want him back, Addie.

I want him back.

I want us back.

You're my wife.

That's all I want.

This is all I want.

I want that too.

He's never gonna leave us.

I'm going to go get
Rachel's car.

It's the only chance
we've got.

Shh.








No.

No, no, no, no, no.


Addie?

Doesn't work.

You! You.

Jesus Christ.

What did they do to you?

Tell him.

Shut up!

Get up, baby.

Addie, we gotta go, baby.

Come on.

Don't fucking move!

Jesus fucking Christ, baby.

We gotta go.

We don't have to
pretend anymore.

I'm so sorry.

You didn't do anything wrong.

It's not your fault.

I'm so sorry.

It was.

It is.

It's OK.

You were holding him.

His head was just dangled
over your shoulder.

And I was so angry, Jonathan.

I was so angry.

And I hated you.

I hate you so much.

But I hated myself
even more, so I...

I went to your office
and I got your gun.

That's why you couldn't
find it.

And I took it to myself.

And I pulled the trigger.

Before I did...

I'm sorry.

Sorry.

I'm so sorry.

It's OK.

It's OK.

We...

We'll...

I'll fix this, OK?

I promise.

I'll fix this.

Hey.

What happened to my house?

They fought really hard.

You never know how
it's gonna go.

Yeah.

She doesn't need a...

To see them?

Wow.

Uh, how do I know
they're gone?

How do you do it?

You make contact.

Hi.

You OK?

RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Get them
to confront their trauma.

They need to be put in a
constant state of terror.

Taken to the same emotional
place that they were in at the

time of death.

What do you want?

Before they can forgive
each other.

We're gonna get through
this together.

I want him back.

I want us back.

You're my wife.

And accept that they're gone.

And once they do, they
finally let go.
