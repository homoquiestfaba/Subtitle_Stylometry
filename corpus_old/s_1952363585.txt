A  Painted  House

MAN: It was early
in September 1952.

The Cardinals were five games
behind the Dodgers,

and the season looked hopeless.

The cotton, however,
was waist-high,

and my father and pappy
could be heard whispering words

that were seldom spoken:

"It could be a good crop."

Highway 135 ran
straight and flat

through the farm country
of the Arkansas Delta.

On both sides,
as far as I could see,

the fields were white
with cotton.

Pappy, my grandfather,
drove 37 miles per hour.

His theory was that every
automobile had a speed

at which it ran
most efficiently,

and through some
vaguely defined method,

he had determined that
his old truck should go 37.

On the nose.

It was time for the harvest--
a wonderful season for me,

because they turned out school
for two months.

For my grandfather, though,
it was a time of endless worry.

In Pappy's opinion,
this was the best spot

in the county
to catch the hill people.

I wasn't so sure.

We'd been trying to hire some
for a week with no results.

(brakes screech)

Howdy.

Good afternoon.

My name's Spruill.

Eli Chandler.

Nice to meet you.

Y'all lookin' for work?

Yep.

Where you from?

Eureka Springs.

Well, I'm looking
for field hands.

How much you paying?

$1.60 a hundred.

Fella wants to give us $1.60.

I think we
should take it.

You think?

Uh, what kind of cotton?

Stoneville.
Bolls are ready.

Be easy to pick.

Well, we made
$1.60 last year.

This the same.

Well, we was
kinda hoping

to make
a little more...

What's your name?

Luke.

Sorry,
can't help you.

What's yours?

Tally.

How old are you?

Ten.

How old are you?

Seventeen.

How long you been riding
that trailer?

Day and a half.

This is Trot.

He ain't right.

Nice to meet you, Trot.

(indistinct conversation)

Your penmanship's
getting better, Luke.

Where's your grandfather?

Across the street,
checking on the Mexicans.

You all using
hill people, too?

Yep.
Just found us some.

Buenos dias, senor.

Buenos dias.

Last year, Juan taught me
some Mexican.

Eli's worried
about paying them too much.

Your grandfather worries
about everything.

He's a farmer.

Are you going
to be a farmer?

No, ma'am.

Baseball player.

For the Cardinals?

Of course.

Here's my truck.

(speaking Spanish)

Buenos dias, senor.

I thought you told them
to set up behind the barn.

I did.

They set up right on
my baseball field.

Well, finally got
the Mexicans.

Seven of them.

Yes, ma'am.

MAN:
That's good.

What are those
people doing in
our front yard?

I asked them to set up
behind the barn.

I don't know why
they pickedthatspot.

Can you ask
them to move?

I cannot.
They pack up,
they'll leave.

You know how
the hill people are.

Segue me, muchachos.

(sheep bleating)

Go on out into
the fields

and tell your dad
supper's almost ready.

(sheep bleating,
chickens clucking)

(guitar picking
slow Spanish melody)

It is... is very nice.
Very clean. Thanks.

It is, isn't it?

Oh.


The garden's full,
and I'll...

bring you a basket
every other day.

Y'all don't have
to pay for it.

It's just... part
of the deal.

Gracias, senora.

ADULT LUKE:
As I rode back from the fields,
holding on to my father,

his shirt and overalls
were soaked with sweat,

but his arms were like steel.

My mother was waiting for us
by the water pump.

She had grown up in a house
full of girls,

and had been raised in part by
a couple of old, prissy aunts.

I think they had bathed more
than farm people,

and her passion for cleanliness
had rubbed off on my father.

I got a complete scrubbing
every Saturday afternoon,

whether I needed it or not.


...picking cotton
or something?


You're all dirty.

RADIO REPORTER:
...subcommittee ended

a 17-month investigation
of mismanagement and scandal

in the Justice Department,
reporting the elimination

of most of the conditions
it had been investigating.

Meanwhile...

No Cardinals game.
Rained out.

Right.

Nothing to
worry about.

It's all the way
up in St. Louis.

Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh...

...adjourned again,
still tightly deadlocked.

They will meet again
September 12.

In related news,
Chinese troops hit Bunker Hill

east of Pan Mun Jom
in two small feeler actions,

as nine other enemy groups

probed along
the Eighth Army Front.

Ricky's all right.

He'll be home
before you know it.

...Chinese troops stormed
the hill.

No bad news.

...were killed in this action.
Meanwhile, northwest of...

If our luck holds out,
we can expect what,

to break even this year?

That's the goal.

Breaking even's not a bad thing.

We don't want for anything.

What about the debt

you and your daddy are carrying
from previous years?

We owe $2,000
to the gin for '51.

We owe the John Deere dealer
in Jonesboro for parts.

Co-op for seed and supplies,
and Watson's for groceries.

I know the situation.

Someday it'll be different.

I'll own my own land,
free and clear.

And how different
will it be, Jesse?

Howdy. How you doing?

Okay.

I'm getting myself
a Cardinals jacket.

Oh, yeah?

Uh, Car-Cardinal red.

It's shiny.

Costs $7.50.

In ten days, I'll have
picked enough to get it.

That's real nice.

JESSE:
Luke!

Yeah?

What are you doing?

I-I had to take a pee.

Keep up now!

Yes, sir.

Cinquenta-dos.

No piedras.

Fifty-two.

All right! Lunch!

Probably heat got him.

TALLY: Thank you.

(engine chugging)

(men speaking Spanish)

Luke...

We'd like you to stay with Trot, 
up here at the house,

for the rest
of the afternoon.

And if he takes a turn for
the worse, y'all just come out

to the lower 40, and fetch
one of the Spruills.

Well... what about
my Cardinal jacket?

There's 80 acres
of cotton out there...

I guess we could save you
a little bit.

(engine chugging)

(gears grinding)

Trot... are you okay?

I guess.

Does Tally like baseball?

(men speaking Spanish)


Ball.

(Trot coughs)

Picked 300 pounds...

then the heat got me.

Fetch me some water, boy.

Sir?

Fetch me some water.

Cold water, boy...
from the house.

And hurry. I've been working
all day-- you ain't.

Give me another glass.


You got anything to eat?

Do you?

Um, no.

You mean no, sir...

don't you, boy?

No, sir.

You farm people are
right uppity, you know that?

Think you're better than us hill
folk because you have this land,

'cause you pay us to work it.

We're just one notch above
them wetbacks, ain't we, boy?

Just a bunch a hillbillies.

Ain't that right, boy?

We got a house
nicer than yours, boy.

A lot nicer.

It's bigger.

Got a long front porch.

And you know what else it's got?

You ain't gonna believe this,

but our house
has got paint on it.

White paint.

You ever see

paint, boy?

Why don't you sodbusters
paint your houses?

Stop it, Hank!


(crickets chirping)

(baseball game on radio)

Stan up?

No, ma'am. Slaughter.

That's a deep fly ball
to right center!

It might be out of here...
No!

It's off
the center field screen.

One run, two runs will score!

And here comes Stanky!

They're waving him in

for number three.

The throw to the plate.
He slides...

He's safe!
Stanky is safe,

and Slaughter will make it

safely into third.

TALLY: Be right back, Pa.

Holy cow!
This game is tied.

Life from the Cardinals.

What a play!
Through seven innings...

Howie Pollet was having

a great night,
showing the Cardinals

why they should've
never traded him.

(guitar strumming,
men singing in Spanish)

Trot told me about
what Hank said...

what he did.

You tell your daddy?

Didn't tell no one.

You scared?

No.

My Pappy would take
a stick to Hank.

He's got a mean streak,
my granddaddy has.

Why, then?

Because...

(long, heavy sigh)

because if...
Pappy punishes Hank,

you folks will pack up

and move down the road
to another farm.

We'll be left
shorthanded.

That's why.

You're smarter
than I thought.

Well, if it
means anything...

I'm sorry about what
Hank done and said.

RADIO ANNOUNCER:
So after their three-run
outburst...

Mama?

Mm-hmm?

Ever think of
painting the house?

Foolishness.

It costs too much.

Luke, someday we'll have a house

with indoor plumbing, and...

shrubs around the porch,

and with paint on the boards.

Maybe even brick.


JESSE:
12:00. Quittin' time!

On Saturdays,
we pick a half day.

Just a half day today.

Â¿Comprende?

We can go to the movies.

I understand.

I don't need a movie.

I need all the work I can get.

On Saturdays,
you work a half day.

Sundays, we don't work at all.

We observe the Sabbath.

On Saturdays, we work half day.

ADULT LUKE:
Town on a Saturday afternoon
was very busy.

All the farmers
and all their families

were loading up on supplies,
talking weather,

and trading gossip.

Hey,buenos dias.

Okay, so, five cents
for the matinee,

five cents for a Double Cola,

three cents for popcorn.

That there
is an advance

against your
pickin' earnings.

You got to pay
that back.

Yes, ma'am.

Bye.

Bye, Mom.

KATHLEEN:
Bye.

(banjo playing)

There's a fight
behind the Co-op!

Come on!
Get out of my way!


Oh, get up!

I'll bet it's
the Sisco brothers.

Told ya.

Who's that?

Don't know.
Probably a hillbilly.

Get up and fight,
hillbilly!

Come on, Jerry,
come on!

Let's go!

Let's go! Come on!

That ain't fair!
Fight like a man!


Hey, you stupid hillbilly!

Let go of my brother!

(grunting and shouting)

(crowd quiets)

Anybody want more?

Come on!

Come on an'
get you some!

(groans, coughs)

Come on. Y'all don't
need to see this.


(thunder rumbles)

I awoke to the sound of rain

and the tin roof sang
under the torrents.

My thoughts were on the fight.

I wanted to tell my father,

but then I did not want
to be a witness.

GRAN:
Luke!

Pappy says the rain's

going to stop in
time for church.

What you want
for breakfast?

Biscuits.

Then I'll make
some biscuits.

I had a dream last night
about Ricky.

A good dream?

Yes, very good.

I dreamed the war
suddenly ended.

They forgot to tell us.

We were all sitting out here
on the porch one night,

and out there
on that road

we saw a man
running toward us.

And it was Ricky.

I wish I could have
a dream like that.

Well, I think the Lord
is telling us something.

Uncle Ricky coming home?

Yes.

Maybe not
right away, but...

the war will
be ended soon.

And we'll look up
and we'll see him

walking across
the yard there.

Gran?
Uh-huh?

I pray for Uncle Ricky
every night.

Oh...

(organ music playing)

Hello, Stick.

You working on a Sunday?

Crime don't seem to
respect the Sabbath.

One of them
Sisco boys is dead.

PAPPY:
Murder?

STICK:
Good folks get murdered.

White trash like the Siscos
get killed.

I still got
to investigate.

I'm going to need
to come out and speak
to one of your hands.

You'll have to wait
till after church.

Some folks go to church.

I'm on duty.

Had a big fight
yesterday in town.

Couple of local boys
got into it

with a fellow
from the hills.

One of them died
this morning.

Fractured skull.

Ain't none of us.
We're peaceful folk.

Is that so?

Y'all go into town
yesterday?

We did.

We did.

You got a boy
named Hank?

Maybe.

Don't play games with me.

I ask you a question,
you give me a straight answer.

Got a big jail
over in Jonesboro

with a lot of room.

I'm Hank Spruill.

Did you go into
town yesterday

and get in a fight
behind the Co-op?

Nope. I stopped the fight.

Couple fellas was beating up
on a boy from the hills.

I stopped it.

You use a piece of wood?

Didn't need to.

I asked you
a question.

Did you use a
piece of wood?

Nope.

They had a two-by-four.

I guess I'd better take you in.

Whoa.

If he goes, we go.

Aw, slow down, Stick.

You and I both know

the Siscos ain't
good for nothin'.

They fight often,
they fight dirty.

Seems to me they
just picked on
the wrong fella.

I got a body, Eli.
You understand?

He was just breaking up a fight.

I heard after
the fight was over,

he picked up a piece of wood
and beat the boys.

Now I know two against one
ain't fair,

and I know it's the Siscos,

but I ain't sure one of them
had to get killed.

I didn't kill nobody.

I broke up a fight.

And there was three of them,
not two.

Ain't a court
in this country

convict three
against one.

That's if he's telling
the truth.

He's going to need witnesses.

Little Chandler saw it.

Come here, Luke.

You see the fight?

Yes, sir.

What were you
doing there?

I heard there was a fight,

so I took off and watched it.

Tell me what you saw.

And tell the truth.

My boy don't lie.

Jerry Sisco was fighting
some man from the hills

when Mr. Hank
stepped in

and helped the man
from the hills.

The first hill
man, he left.

I think he was
hurt pretty bad.

Then, all of a sudden,

Bobby Sisco charged
from the crowd

and attacked Mr. Hank.

It was three against one,
just like Mr. Hank said.

That settles it.

Who used the two-by-four?

Tell him, boy.

One of them Sisco boys picked up
that stick of wood, didn't he?

(breathing hard)

Didn't he, boy?

You watch yourself, boy.

Stick, you're scaring
my boy to death.

There must be
a lot of people

who saw this fight.

What say we go
bedevil them.

I'm going to keep
asking around.

And I might be back.

Luke, why didn't you
tell us about that fight?

I was scared, I guess.

Scared? Scared of what?

Scared of getting caught
behind the Co-op

watching a fight.

Uh, Luke, I'm not
too worried about you
watching a fight.

But keeping secrets
can get you into trouble.

You should've told us
what you saw.

I saw a fight.

Never knew Jerry Sisco
was going to die.

And you told Stick Powers
the truth?

Yes, sir.

One of them Sisco boys
picked up that stick of wood

or was it Hank Spruill?

Well...

to be honest, Dad,
things happened so fast.

There was bodies falling
and flying everywhere.

Hank was throwing
those boys around

like they were little toys.

The crowd was moving
and hollering.

Then I saw the stick of wood.

Luke, honey, little
boys who keep secrets
from their parents

can get in big trouble.

You can tell us anything.

Yes, ma'am.

Supper in an hour,
okay?

Okay.

"Dear Mom and Dad

"and Jessie and Kathleen
and Luke,

"I hope all
is well at home.

"I never thought
I'd miss cotton picking,

"but I sure wish
I was home right now.

I miss everything..."

(sighs heavily)

"...the farm,
the fried chicken,
the Cardinals.

"Anyway, I'm doing fine
over here.

"Things are quiet.

"We're not on
the front anymore.

"My unit
is five miles back,

"and nobody
is shooting at us

"and we're not
shooting at anybody.

"I really think
I'll be home soon.

"I got your last
batch of letters,

"and they mean
a lot to me.

"So keep writing.
Got to run.

Love to all,
Ricky."

(screen door closes)

We won't be going
to town Saturday.

Why not?

Because I say so.

You ain't afraid
of the Siscos, are you?

Be best if
the Spruills

stay out of town for a while.

I discussed it with Mr. Spruill,

and we decided it'd be best
to stay put on Saturday.

Even the Mexicans.

Hey.

I ain't afraid of nobody, son.

Don't you sass me.

I don't see why
I got to do this,

if we're not
going to town.

I'll do it.

(clears throat)

I'm going to Pop and Pearl's
for a few things.

You want to go, Luke?

No, sir.

Buy you a cola.

No, thanks.

Hey...

no need to be just
as stubborn as he is.




Oh!

After five days
of endless labor and heat,

and without the prospect
of going to town,

we all got together
and played baseball.

Cowboy pitched
for the Mexicans,

and was surprisingly good.

He struck me out easily.

I was humiliated,
especially in front of Tally.

MAN: Come on now, girl!
Get a hit on him.

Give it a whack, Tally.
He ain't no pitcher.

Oh! That's all right.

Let's go, Tally, give it a ride.


Good contact.
That's the game.

When Tally got a hit,

my humiliation,
enormous, grew even greater.

MIGUEL: Foul! Strike two.

TALLY: Come on, Hank!

Hank wasn't having any better
luck than me against Cowboy,

and when he struck out, I
was glad my father was around.

Don't throw the bat.

If you can't be a sport,
then don't play.

It was now Hank's turn
to pitch to Cowboy.

He reached back for all
the juice he could find,

and hurled a fastball
directly at him.



Hey! Hey!

Hey. Hey.

Put it down!

Put it down!

Fight like a man.

Nobody's fighting you.

Miguel, get him back
to the barn.

Come on, Hank.

I'm going to kill that boy.

You've killed enough.

All right, come on, Hank.
Let's go. Come on.

I'm going to kill him.

(muttering in Spanish)

Stay away from the barn, Hank.

MAN: I gonna to talk to him.
Come on home.

(whispers in Spanish)

TALLY: Psst!

Will you do me
a favor, Luke?

Your grandma told my mom

there's a creek close by
we can bathe in.

Do you know where it is?

Silers' Creek.

About a half-mile that way.

Are there any snakes?

Maybe a little water snake
or two-- no cottonmouth.

Well... will you go with me?

Why?

I don't know.

Make sure nobody sees me.

Are you scared?

Maybe, a little.

I'm real sorry about Hank.

He's always causing trouble.

Did you see the fight?

The one in town? No.

Was it awful?

Yeah, pretty bad.

He beat those boys so bad.

He beat them long after
the fight was over.

Now, you tell me
the truth, Luke.

Did he pick up
that stick first?

Happened real fast.

Has he ever killed anyone before?

Not that I know of.

He went up north once...

and he got into some
trouble up there...

but we never knew
what happened.

That's the best spot.

How deep is it?

About here.

Well, you go on back
up by the trail,

and make sure
nobody's looking, okay?

Okay.

Go on.

Okay!

And, Luke...

no peeking, okay?

Course not.

Luke!

Yeah?

Is everything clear?

Yep.

Thanks, Luke.

I feel so much better.

You saw me,
didn't you, Luke?

Yes.

That's okay. I'm not mad.

You're not?

No.

I guess it's only natural,
you know...

for boys to look at girls.

(turns off engine)

Someone's coming!

(honks horn)

Hey, everybody.

Look who's back.

Jimmy Dale?

Why, it's Jimmy Dale!

Dang, Jimmy!
We haven't seen you in ages.

How you doing?

Hey, folks,
this here's my bride, Stacy.

She's from Michigan.

Now, this here's my Uncle Eli,

and, uh...
his son, my cousin Jess,

and that there is Gran,

and Kathleen, Jess's wife,

and Kathleen's boy, Luke.

I brung Stacy down
to meet all the relatives.

I'm so pleased to meet you.

Some car, Jimmy.

Yep, it's brand-new.

Got it last week.

Me and Stacy got married
a month ago, and, uh,

it's our wedding present.

"Stacy and I got married;"
not "me and Stacy."

ELI:
What is it?

'52?

No, no, it's '53.

Newest thing on the road.

Built it myself.

You don't say.

Yeah, Buick lets us
custom-order our own cars,

and then they, uh,
you get to watch them

when they come
down the line.

I put the dashboard
in this one.

How much did it cost?

KATHLEEN: Luke!

$2,700. It's no secret.

Every dealer in the country
knows how much they cost.

Hill people?

Yeah... Eureka Springs.

Why do they
live like that?

How else could they live?

Can't you provide
housing for them?

Anyway, um...
(clears throat)

Buick will let us finance
the cars for 24 months.

Here's some sweet tea.

Tea with ice-- whew!

None for me.

Thank you.

Do you have any hot tea?

We don't drink hot tea
around here.

Well, up in Michigan,
we don't drink it with ice.

This ain't Michigan.

Would you like to see
my garden, Stacy?

Yeah, that's
a great idea.

Go on, sweetheart.
Uh, Kathleen's got

just about the prettiest
garden in Arkansas.

GRAN: I'll go with you.

Where in Pete's sake did you
find her, Jimmy Dale?

She's a sweet girl, Eli.

Sh-yeah.

She is a Yankee.

Yankees ain't so bad.

Hell, they were smart enough
to avoid cotton.

They-They make good money,
and they build good schools.

Stacy's family lives in
a real nice house with, uh...

indoor plumbing and a telephone
and television.

How's Luther?

He's doing real well.

I got him on
at the plant.

He's making $3 an hour,
40 hours a week.

Luther ain't never seen
so much money.

He was picking cotton
for other people around here,

making what,
a thousand bucks a year?

Now he makes $6,000 a year,
plus a bonus and retirement.

$6,000?

Yes, sir.

Luke, go check
on your mama.

Go on.


Where's the clutch?

Ain't got no clutch;
it's a automatic.

Yeah.

I think I inherited it.

We seem to have a lot
of green thumbs in my family.

We get almost everything
we eat out of here.

It's amazing how much

can provide
for the wintertime, too.

It's-it's really incredible, actually.

GRAN: Oh, look what you found.


Jimmy Dale! Snake! Jimmy Dale!

Oh, my gosh!

It's just a green one.

Don't they have snakes
up in Michigan?

Gracias.

De nada.

Oh...

Oh, dear!

I'll make some hot tea.

I'll... help you.

Luke, you watch after Stacy.

I've never ridden in a car.

We have a truck.

How old are you?

Ten years old.

You're ten, and you've never
ridden in a car?

You ever seen a television?

In the catalogues.

Ever use a telephone?

No, ma'am.

Unbelievable.

Do you go to school?

Yes, ma'am.

Well, thank heavens.

I just can't believe how
backward you people are.

Here we are.

Jimmy Dale!

If we don't get going,
we're going to be late.

Oh, that's right.

Um, she has to go
to the bathroom.

Oh... come with me.


You don't have
indoor plumbing?!

Uh, well, this is it.

(whines and whimpers)

I'll give you
some privacy.


(Stacy gasps)

Miss Stacy, it's me, Luke.

I'm occupied!

Well, um, don't
come out right now.

There's a big black
snake out here.

Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh!

Shh! Be quiet!

Otherwise he'll know
that you're in there.

Do something!

I can't.
He's big and he bites.

Get Jimmy Dale.

Okay, but-but don't come out.

He's right by the door.


(honks horn)

Getting in some
practice, Luke?

Yes, sir.

You be careful
you don't bother the Mexicans.

And keep an eye out for
them big, biting black snakes.

That was a good one, Luke.

Served her right.


You little dickens.

Come with me to the Latchers.

The Latchers were a family
of sharecroppers

who lived no more than a mile
from our house.

Their rundown shack contained
a horde of little Latchers.

They had no electricity.

Mom's delivery was one part
kindness and one part gossip.

Hello, Mrs. Chandler.

Oh, I'm glad you're here.

It's... it's Libby.

She's about to have the baby.

A baby?

Yes. She's in labor.

Well, we better
get the doctor.

Oh, no, we can't do that.

No one can know about this;
no one.

We've got to keep it quiet.

We're so ashamed.

She won't tell us
who the father is

and right now, I don't care.

If the doctor comes,
the whole county will know.

We got to keep this quiet,
Mrs. Chandler, please.

Can you promise me?

I'll get Gran. She's
done this many times.

Please do.

And hurry.

I'll back in
half an hour.

(starts engine)


GRAN:
We have to get these
in the truck, Miguel.

KATHLEEN: Miguel, please tell
Jesse to watch Luke.

Si, senora.

Mom and Gran
were up to something,

but I didn't know what.

I saw Tally
over at the water pump

and decided we could
figure it out together.

Luke... what are you doing?

Promise you won't tell?

Promise.

RADIO ANNOUNCER:
And storm clouds gathering in
the northern part of the state

moving at a south-southeasterly
direction, so we can see...

(girl crying and groaning)

Mama!

(girl panting)

(girl crying and groaning)

(grunting, screaming)

KATHLEEN: Mr. Latcher, you
got those towels?

Here you go, ma'am.

Thank you.

GRAN:
Breathe. Breathe.

Okay, we're ready?

Water!

Push now, push. Push. Push.

GRAN:
There it is!

Good, good.

Good girl.

You're doing fine, honey.

Only a couple more now.

Good girl.
Rest now, rest.

(girl panting)

Wait, wait, wait...
wait till I tell you.

Okay now, push. Push!

GRAN: Push, push.

(girl screaming)

GRAN: It's coming.

It's coming. It's doing great.

Good. Good girl.

It's a boy!

(baby crying)

Here's your baby.

Congratulations.

LUKE:
Ma, better come and see this.

Mmm, still fresh.

Someone's paintin' our house.

You know, I bet it's Trot.

He's the only one
who has the time

and he's here by
the house all day

with nothing to do.

Wonder why he'd
do such a thing?

Where'd he get the paint?

It's a mystery.

(wind whistling)


Everybody in the house!

Kath! Kath! Get him!

Luke, come on.

Let's go!

Let's go!

(all shouting)

Hurry, Luke!

Hurry!

Tornados were common
in our part of Arkansas

and I'd heard many stories
about them.

We watched the funnel
in muted fascination,

and as suddenly as it appeared,

it was gone.

(distant thump)

After three days
of peace and hard work,

I was awakened
in the middle of the night.

I crept toward my window

and peered
through the darkness.


And there was Hank,
still angry and determined

to torment Cowboy
and the other Mexicans.

(thunder rumbles)

COWBOY (half-whispers):
Me gustas mucho.

I like you very much.

TALLY: Me gustas mucho.


COWBOY: Tu tambien.

What does that mean?

You, too.

(both giggling)

Eres muy bonita.

What does that mean?

You are very beautiful.


You think I'm beautiful?

Quieres ser mi novia?

(Tally giggles)

COWBOY: Sweetheart?

Mom?

Mm-hmm?

There's something
I need to tell you.

What is it?

I think Tally and Cowboy
like each other.

Oh, really?

Now, how do
you know this?

I caught them
in the cotton patch.

What were they doing?

I don't know.

But they were together.

Do you think
they were kissing?

Probably.

Oh, well.

I'll talk to your father about it.

Hi, girls.

Hi, Mrs. Chandler.

MRS. LATCHER:
Hi, Mrs. Chandler. Hi, Luke.

Hey!

Howdy.

Thank you very much.

Oh, you're welcome.

Mrs. Chandler.

How's the baby?

Oh, he's fine.

Good.

I-I guess
you want to see him.

Yes, I would.

Luke?

Howdy, Percy.

We're going to whoop
your behind, Luke.

Why?

'Cause you're a Chandler,

and your Ricky did that
to Libby.

It wasn'tmyfault.


Stop!

What in the world?!

Elijah!

Luke, are you
all right, honey?

Cut me a switch!

What do you mean, beating up
on a little boy like that?

He ain't done nothing!

I want you to watch this.

No, Darla, we're leaving.

What was that all about?

For what Ricky did to Libby.

We don't know that for sure.

(switch whipping, boys yelling)

â™ªAy ay ay-ayâ™ª

â™ªCanta y no lloresâ™ª

â™ªPorque cantando se alegran...â™ª

Si, Senor...

You're not going to believe
what happened.

Three of them jumped Luke,
the little criminals.

We're taking food over, and
they pull a stunt like this.

Three. You didn't
run away, did you?

No, he did not.

He was kicking and clawing
just as much as they were.

Hey, you land a good punch?

They were all crying when I left.

HANK: You say there were
three of them, huh?

Well, good for you, boy.
It'll make you tough.

GRAN: Well, I think
it's broken.

You okay, Luke?

Yep.

Come on.

Let's get you
out of those muddy clothes.

Aw, no.
Come on, champ.

Come on over there.

Yeah!

All right.

Yeah!



iViva Luke! iViva Luke!

(sheep bleating)

Where you going?

I don't know.

Just walking.

Going to the creek?

You'd like that,
wouldn't you?


Not this time.

I'm-I'm not bathing.

It's just to sit on.

(cow mooing)


Jesse, how much
did Hank pick today?

Under 200.

I'd say 190.

He was picking 400 a week ago.

I've got a good mind
to drive into town tomorrow.

Find Stick Powers, tell him
I'm done with the boy.

Mexicans are saying

somebody's still throwing rocks

at the barn at night.

Well, it seems to me,
the thing to do

is tell Mr. Spruill
that Stick is coming after Hank.

Let the boy sneak away at night.

He'll be gone.
That's all that matters.

Mr. Spruill will be thankful

you kept him
from gettin' arrested.

Pappy, we done
passed the Co-op.

Mr. Watson wants to see you.


Hey, Luke,
come here.

I want to show you
something, boy.

(indistinct voices)

Come on!

It's the World Series.

ANNOUNCER:
I don't have to tell you...

Game Three, Dodgers
at Yankee Stadium.

...what a big game this is
for these crosstown rivals.

Who you pullin' for?

I don't know.

Dodgers, I guess.

You always got to pull
for the National League.

Here's the windup...
and the pitch.

Wow, he got
under all of that one...

Hey!

Farther...

Yeah!
Yeah!

It's drifting back, back...

Yes, home run.

That's right.


I'll be danged.

Had some heavy rains
up in North County last night.

Six inches or more.

Ain't no tellin'
when they're gonna be able

to get a wagon
in them fields.

My cousin in Oklahoma
got flooded out.

We ain't had a flood in October
in 20 years.

Hey, Luke.

Hey, Tally.

I just saw the World Series...
on a television.

I'm going to have a television 
of my own someday.

What's the paint for?

Oh, nothing.


Let's go, Luke.

JESSE: Stick tells me he's
coming out here to take Hank.

Well, I'll talk to him.

All right.

Probably be better
if he heads out.

All right.

Well, like I say, I'll talk to him.

How'd he take it?

Well, they need
the money.

They say that old Sheriff
Stick's coming to get you.

I ain't afraid of
that dumb sheriff.

But you don't want
to get arrested.

I didn't
do nothing.

The Chandlers
want you to leave.

Aw, I got more
money in my pocket

than them sodbusters
will ever have.

Just go on back
home now, son.

Let things cool down.

Go on. I'll deal
with this.

All right, I'll leave.


What's going on here?

None of your business, Hank.

Go home.

You heard him.

Get on out of here,

or I'll tell Ma and Pa
what you're doing.

Go home.

Come on up here, brown skin.

I'm fixin'
to teach you something.

Now I'm going to settle
your hash once and for all.

You like my sister,Mexicano?

Huh?


You're a slippery
little wetback, ain't ya?


(switchblade clicking)



Come here.

Shh.

Silence.

You been to the river?

Then where have you been?

You speak one word
of this to anyone,

and I will
kill your mother.

Understand?!

No matter--
you tell them next year,

you tell them when I'm gone,

I will come back,
and I will kill your mother.

JESSE: You okay, Luke?

Didn't eat enough
to feed a bird.

Just tired.

Tonight you go
to bed early, okay?


Any reason the truck
would be gone?

Say what?

The truck's gone.

I left it right here.

MR. SPRUILL: Tally!

Where was the key?

On the radio,

same as always.

We lost Tally.

I can't find her no place.

Could she drive a truck?

No, she can't. What?

Don't suppose Hank took it.

Hank would not steal
your truck.

Hank's halfway home by now.

We better go check
the barn for Cowboy.

Morning, Miguel.

Senor.

Is there a problem?

Si, senor,a little problem.

What is it?

Cowboy is gone.

Must be contagious.

You think he took her?

I don't know what to think.

He took my baby?

We need to get the law
into this.

I'm going to go
unhook the truck

from the tent.

Jesse will go with you.

Go on, son.

No, Luke, honey.

It's not your place.

When the weather didn't let up,
Pappy got concerned

that the rain
would swell the river.

We'd be flooded out.

But there was
a secret part of me

that prayed the riverwouldrise

and wash everything away.

We'll check it later.

Found it in
the bus station

over in Jonesboro.

Where's the key?

Under the seat.

And it had
a full tank of gas.

I don't know if it had
a full one when it left here,

but it's full now.

It was half empty.

They must have just
borrowed it.

That's the way I see it.

You still want
to press charges?

I guess not.

Did anybody see 'em?

They bought two tickets
to Chicago.

When the bus got loaded,

they both got on
and sat together.

MR. SPRUILL:
What time the bus leave?

6:00 this morning.

Found this on the front seat.

It's a note from Tally to y'all.

I ain't read it.

Ain't none of my
business, ma'am,

but if there's any useful
information, I need to know.

She says she
ain't comin' home.

She says she and Cowboy
are gettin' married.

Gonna live up north

where they can find
good jobs and such.

They going to stay
in Chicago?

Don't say.

Just says up north.

Well, thanks, Stick, for
bringing the truck back.

Much obliged.

Oh, ain't nothing.

Say, Eli.

Where's that big one-- Hank?

He took off for home.

Well, I'm going
to call the sheriff

up in Eureka Springs.

I ain't through with him,
you know.

When I find him,

I'm going to put him
in the jail in Jonesboro,

and we're going to have us
that trial.

Yeah, you do that, Stick.

Although there were
occasional clear days,

the news was somber
and threatening.

Heavy rains had hit Clay County
north of us.

The creeks and streams
were flooded up there

and poured into the river.

The water was rising.

JESSE: Well, the ground's
too soft.

Cotton's too wet.

Guess they've had enough.

Over here.

It's for you.

Tally bought it.

Thanks.

How am I doing?

Ah, it's beautiful, Luke.

Just go slow
and take your time.

And don't fall.

I'm not gonna fall.

We picked near 1,100
pounds between us.

The rains start
to drive the prices up.

Yeah, a few more dry
days, we're clear.

(thunder rumbling)

(speaking Spanish)

JESSE: Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke,
come on.

The rains had forced us all

to kill long hours
in and around the house.

Even on days when the sun tried
to break through the clouds,

the cotton was too wet
and the ground was too soft.

The Mexicans were delighted
to have something to do,

and we all attacked
the unpainted house

with a vengeance.

Pappy,
if I told you a secret,

would you promise
not to tell anybody else?

Let's try it out.

Hank is dead.

Cowboy killed him.

With that knife of his.

I saw it all.

Hank saw Cowboy
and Tally together.


Tally see this, too?

No, sir.

Cowboy sent her away.

They fought at the bridge.

Hank landed in the middle
of the river,

and he never came back up.

You should have
told me then.

I just couldn't.

Cowboy see you?

What are we gonna do, Pappy?


Killed their son and stole
their daughter. My, oh, my.

Are we gonna tell anybody?

Nope, I don't think so.

Nothing we can say is
gonna bring that boy back,

and tellin' folks
will just...

make a fuss
none of us need.

Well, what about
Mr. and Mrs. Spruill?

It'll only hurt
them if they knew.

We ain't tellin' nobody.

Just be our secret--

one we'll take to our
graves, just you and me.

But you done right
telling me.

Don't you worry none.
I'll handle this.

Hey, don't worry.

I'll handle it.

It's over the banks.


It's floodin'.

Four cans of paint
coming right up.

That's not enough.

That'll do for now.

That'll be, uh, ten dollars
plus tax of 36 cents.

Well, looks like I just
brought ten with me.

I'll bring in the tax next time.

Well, sure, Jesse.

Let me go talk to Riggs.

You help Mr. Watson put
this paint in the truck.

I'll be back
in a few minutes.

How much is two gallons?

$2.50 a gallon.

Total of five dollars.

Here's five.

You pick cotton
for that money?

Yes, sir.

Does your daddy know
you're buying paint?

Not yet.

What are y'all
painting out there?

Our house.

But why're you doing that?

'Cause it ain't never
been painted before.

Plus 18 cents for tax,
you got that?

How much does my daddy
owe you for tax?

36 cents.

Take it from this.

All right.

(cash register rings)

It's a very good job, Luke.

How much paint is left?

None. It's all gone.

How much do you need
to paint the front?

Reckon four or five gallons.

I don't want you to spend
your own money on paint.

It'smymoney.

Y'all said I could spend
it on whatever I wanted.

What about your jacket?

Maybe Santa Claus
will bring me one.


You ready for some lunch?

Yep.

All right.

Backwaters trickling across the
main road into the back forty.


Miguel...

tragueme todos muchachos.

Muchachos.

PAPPY:
Todos hombres, aqui.

PAPPY:
Marque lina para agua,
por favor.

MIGUEL:
Una fila marquando
donde termina la agua.

It's here.

Two inches of it.

Cotton's wet.

The sun breaks, we maybe
can get a hundred pounds each.

Jesse, go on into town,
check on the Co-op,

see if there's another farm

where the Mexicans
might get work.

GRAN:
This cotton's soaking wet.

They're not gonna get 50 pounds.

It's a waste of time.

LUKE: Can I go to town?

KATHLEEN: Well, yeah.

We need more paint.

GRAN: What foolishness, spending
good money on house paint

when we're losing
another crop!

Can't leave the house
half-and-half.

We've got to finish
the job.

No mas trabajo aqui.

Lo siento.

Si, senor.

(thunder rolling)

I have a secret for you.

Can you keep a secret?

Sure.

Your daddy and I are thinking
about going up north.

What about me?

Why, you're going, too.

What about Pappy and Gran?

They're gonna be okay.

It's gonna be exciting, Luke.
Trust me.

It'll be an adventure.

Okay?

Get in that bed.

Night.

Night.

Reckon it's safe?


I sure hope so.

â™ª How they run â™ª

â™ª When they hear
the fella's gun â™ª

â™ª Because the Western folks
all know â™ª

â™ª He's a highfalutin',
scootin', shootin' â™ª

â™ª Son of a gun from Arizona â™ª

â™ª Ragtime Cowboy... â™ª

JACKIE: Hey, Jesse.

Jackie.

How you doing?

â™ª Ragtime,
talk about your Ragtime... â™ª

Now, Little Chandler, what
could possibly bring you here?

Ice cream.

A sundae for the boy, Cindy.

Y'all pickin' out there?

Well, creek came over
last night.

Moved more than half
a mile before sunrise.

Lower forty's gone.

Yeah, all the creeks
are backing up.

Just... putting a lot of
pressure on the St. Francis.

You know someone who
needs any Mexicans?

I got six of them now
with nothing to do.

Ready to go home.

Yeah, I think Riggs
might know some farmers

up north of Blytheville.

They might take 'em.

Thanks, Jackie.

Mm-hmm.

I had another dream last night
that Ricky came home.

It was windy,

and he was standing
out in the road in the wind,

and he made it
just in time for Christmas.

(knocking on door)

Mr. Latcher.

LATCHER: Excuse me, ma'am,
I need to speak to Mr. Chandler.

Oh, he's in the barn.
What is it?

We've been flooded out.

Water's up past the porch
and in the house.

Can you help us?

We ain't got no place to go.

Of course we can help.

You folks can stay here.

The loft is clean.
The Mexicans just left.

You'll have a warm bed
and plenty of food.

Let's get a move on.

We'll get the loft ready.

Come on.
Let's go get dry.

Come on, honey.

Now, after you get dressed,
you run down to the kitchen

and get something to eat.

They ain't much,
but they're dry.

Some of them have been in
the family for generations.

(baby crying)

What's his name?

Don't have one yet.

When's Ricky coming home?

I don't know.

(crying continues)

Shh...


Did you say good-bye
to the Mexicans?

Yes, ma'am.

Does that mean we're
done pickin' cotton?

Sure looks like it.

Why does our land
flood so quick?

Because... it's low and...

close to the river.

It's just not
very good land, Luke.

That's one reason
why we're leaving here.

How long we gonna be
up north?

Not long.

We'll stay until
we save some money.

When we come back,
what are we going to do?

Well...

we're not gonna farm.

We'll get a job in Memphis
or Little Rock,

and we'll buy us a house

with a television

and a telephone.

And we'll have a nice car
in the driveway,

and you can play baseball

on a team
that has real uniforms.

How does that sound to you?

Sounds pretty good.

(cow moos in distance)

We'll always come back and visit
Pappy and Gran and Ricky, but...

it'll be a new life, Luke.

PAPPY: The crop loans
can be rolled over

till next spring.

The other bills
can be put off, too.

I hate the thought of riding those
I owe, but...

How do we get through
the winter?

We got plenty of food, but...

what about gasoline and...

electricity and oil for the truck?

Well...

about a third of the crop
is still out there

standing in water.

Weather breaks, we might be able
to salvage a bit of it.

That'll get us some money.

The gin'll take most of that.

Jimmy Dale...

is holding a job for me
at the Buick plant.

But he can't wait long.

Jobs are tight right now, so...

we need to get on up there.

He says I can make
as much as $200 a week.

We'll send home
as much as we can.

But we got to leave...
day after tomorrow.

Eat your food, son.

You'll be leaving tomorrow.

Yes, sir.

Should be coming back soon.

Yes, sir.

Been thinking more
about Hank and Cowboy.

Let's leave it be
like we agreed.

Can't nothing good come
from telling nobody.

It's our secret.

Deal?

Deal.

Don't forget about your
pappy up there, you hear?

I won't.

MAN (over radio):
Bugle-blowing,
Chinese Communist troops

hurled 14 separate attacks
at United Nations forces...

(baby crying) Oh, come here.

Shh, shh, shh.

Meanwhile,
Allied fliers swarmed low

along western and central
sectors on the front,

in close-support forays.

They reported knocking out
close to 50 Communist bunkers

and killing 58 of the enemy.

Elsewhere, surface...

Luke, I've written Ricky a letter

telling him all about the baby.

Do you have his address?

Yeah, I got it.

Do you have an envelope?

Sure.

Could you mail my letter for me?

Please, Luke. I don't think
Ricky knows about the baby.

I guess I can mail it.

Thank you, Luke.

(baby continues crying)


Don't come back here
talkin' like a Yankee.

We're gonna be fine.

I know.

miss you so much.

Good job, Luke.

You done a good job.

Just wish we'd finished.

Yeah.

I figure...
another gallon?

Yes, sir.

That's about right.

I'll get it done this winter.

Thanks, Pappy.

When y'all come home,
it'll be finished.

I'd like that.

Let's shake on it.

When we pulled away,
Gran was standing

by the front porch,
wiping her face.

My father told me not to cry,

but I couldn't help it.

My heart ached.

But at the same time,

I knew our adventure
was just beginning.

And I hoped
when I returned one day,

my Uncle Ricky
would be coming home, too,

just like in Gran's dreams.

We would be
a complete family again.
