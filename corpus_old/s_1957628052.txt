[Bull shit]
 Language, Duncan.

2 
Whatever, fine.
Me and my bad attitude are outta here.

3 
That's fine with me.

4 

5 
How do you like ... THAT!

6 

7 
[Background music...]

8 
[Door opens] After you....
Thanks.
See you next week.

9 

10 
Wait wait.  Duncan..it's me, Duncan.  
[Jake:] It's my brother, it's Duncan.

11 
What are you doing out here?

12 
Geez, you scared the piss out of me.

13 
It's my apartment.

14 
Hey, Wonder Woman,
Could you point that somewhere else please?
 ... Thank you.

15 
Sandy, why don't you go
warm up the car, okay?

16 
You'll be safe, I'll watch you. I promise.
Okay, but watch close.
Okay.

17 
She seems nice.

18 
And vigilant.

19 
I'm sure your wife would like her.

20 
Why do you always do that?

21 
What happened to work?
Did you get fired again?

22 
I was just ... why do you always do that?
Jesus you got fired again.
  You've only been there a couple of weeks.

23 
God, you are such an incompetent.

24 
Come on, cut me some slack, Jake.

25 
I haven't asked you for money in a long time.

26 
Yeah but I've given you plenty.  I've left
a little something on the table tonight.

27 
That doesn't count.  You think you're doing me
a favor by bringing all these bimbos here?

28 
Go screw 'em somewhere else.

29 
Alright, quit being a dick.
  Do you want some capital or not?

30 
No, actually.

31 
I'm fine.
I'll ... work it out.

32 
[Horn honks]

33 
Sheez, the shit I put up with.

34 
Just let me know if you need some cash okay?

35 
And go visit grandma and grampa's new place.
They've been asking about you.

36 
Eh, I dunno I got a lot of stuff to do.
Yeah I know you're a really busy guy
but maybe you could squeeze in

37 
ten minutes of your hectic
unemployed schedule and go see 'em.

38 
I just don't like to see 'em like that.

39 
It doesn't matter dude.
It's why they moved to the city,
to be close to us.

40 
Pull your head out. Take the fifty I left you,
get grandma a coffee cake and get your ass over there.

41 
See ya.

42 
What am I, made of money?

43 
[Background music...]

44 
[Background music]

45 
Jesus Dunc, how many jobs is that?

46 
Why, you writing my resume?
Do you even have a resume?

47 
Is that how you landed that great gig
as piss boy at the paint store?

48 
What about your office?
Got any jobs there?

49 
Oh please, come on. Even the guys in
the mailroom have a college degree.
[Hey Lindy.]

50 
Besides you don't work there.
Eveyone's an asshole.

51 
Including you? 
Especially me.

52 
Maybe Finn can give you a job
at the warehouse, huh?

53 
Finn! Would you want to work for Finn?

54 
The predominant majority of jobs
here are union, Dunc.

55 
I'm totally union.
I'm like Norma fuckin' Rae.

56 
It's a grand to join.
You have to apprentice for six months.

57 
Apprentice what, it's a forklift.

58 
It's like a golf cart
with the lifting thing on front.

59 
It's not that easy.

60 
Well, you do it.
[Slams on brakes, Duncan falls off.]

61 
Oops. Okay, very funny.

62 
Yeah.

63 
Nice!

64 
I don't think you appreciate the
precariousness of the situation here.

65 
If you hurt yourself,
if you break something,
that's a liability.

66 
Yeah, precariousness?

67 
You realize that you sound like Don King
when you use big words, Finn?

68 
And, come on,
it's moving boxes of liquor.

69 
I think I can handle that.

70 
You know something Dunc, the
last time I gave you a job [muffled].

71 
Jesus we were seventeen,
we were mowing lawns.

72 
I know that, okay?
And you mowed the word asshole into
somebody's lawn and I got fired, Dunc.

73 
I got fired.

74 
Whatever happened to your sense of humor?
And that was a long time ago.

75 
Well what have you been doing
with your life since then?

76 
I've been working my ass off
trying to improve my status quo.

77 
Why would I just give you a job?

78 
I don't know.
I do appreciate how hard you had
to work here at Finn and Son, Finn.

79 
But I was hoping that maybe
you would have my back on this.

80 
Nah, no Doug, I can't.  I'm sorry.

81 
Don't kick it.
I didn't do anything.

82 
[Background music]

83 
But he sees me in the hall with the thing,
and he says to me that's not how you do it.

84 
So I says back "Well Christ."
How do you do it,
you saw dog midget half-wit?

85 
Ronald, you did not say that to him.

86 
I'm telling this story, Ruth.

87 
Mmm.  So tell it right.

88 
I bet ten years ago
you had to set him straight, grampa.

89 
Damn right, Duncan.

90 
Damn right.

91 
I may be old, but
I still got my two friends,
my left fist and my right.

92 
It's too bad your old pal
common sense left so long ago.

93 
Ten years!
Duncan, I was going to call you on Monday.

94 
Did you remember that?

95 
Yeah, yeah.

96 
I saw it on the calendar.

97 
How's the shoe store, kiddo?

98 
The shoe store?

99 
Jacob says he's working in groceries.

100 
Yeah, I was.

101 
I was, for about three months.

102 
Groceries.

103 
That's not a good racket.
Markups no good.

104 
You know, I should probably get going.

105 
I've just got a bunch of stuff
I should be doing today.

106 
You do not. You just got here.

107 
You haven't even seen the view.

108 
Come see the view.
 - Yeah.

109 
See?

110 
That's beautiful. You've got
both the downtowns and a river.

111 
Yeah.

112 
At night, can see the northern lights.

113 
Really, the northern lights?
Seen 'em last night, dancin'.

114 
That's funny, I didn't know [...].
Ronald, did you go yet today?

115 
Didn't I go, Ruth?

116 
Well, I know, but you have to be
 on a schedule with this medication.
 It's your kidneys.

117 
Okay.

118 
Alright, get up now.  One..two.
No need Duncan, we got a system.

119 
Well that was slitch.
(archaic: slide + pitch)

120 
Grampa's little helper.
You remember that, Ruth?
Yep.

121 
You used to follow me around the hardware
store all day long trying to help.

122 
You look like your dad.

123 
So do you.

124 
I'm better lookin' than he ever was.

125 
Grampa's little helper.

126 
Well yell if you need some assistance.

127 
Assistance?

128 
Taking a leak for Christ sakes.

129 
That's where grampa's little helper
draws the line okay? [Laughs]

130 
Excuse me.

131 
Could I get an application?
We're out.  Waiting for the
printer to send more, about a week.

132 
Just need your name and address,
I can send you one then.

133 
So this is the admission forms desk
and you're out of admission forms.

134 
Great.

135 
[Background music]

136 
[Phone rings]

137 
Hello?

138 
Hey, good morning.

139 
Well what sort of situation?

140 
Did you call 911?

141 
Grampa, if you're having an
emergency you call 911.

142 
Okay I'll be right here.

143 
Grampa?
In here.

144 
You Okay?
You need to get this out
into the other room.

145 
What? The TV?
Yeah yeah, this is what I need.

146 
You gotta slide it out there.

147 
I thought that you were hurt.
I said emergency and it is.  Come on.

148 
Let's get the goddamn thing outta here.

149 
No no don't. You don't take off your coat.
You don't have time. She'll be back any minute now.

150 
I'm baking in this thing.

151 
Hurry.
I'll have it done in a second.

152 
Ronald, I'm home.

153 
Oh Christ.

154 
No matter now, Duncan [mumbles].

155 
Ronald, you know Kate's gonna be here.
You're gonna need to get cleaned up.

156 
Duncan, hi!

157 
Ronald!
I was just having the kid
 move some things.

158 
No TV, you know that.
Ruth.

159 
Why can't he have the TV?

160 
Because he'll just sit and watch it and do not
another damn thing.  It mushes his brain.

161 
Load of shit.

162 
[Knocking at door]

163 
Listen, would you get the door?

164 
We'll be out in a minute.

165 
Ronald, don't you bring him into this now.

166 
He wanted to help.

167 
Nothing wrong with a kid helping out his grandfather.

168 
[Knocking at door]

169 
[Door opens]
Um, am I in the right place?

170 
Yeah, the Shorters, Ruth and Ronald.

171 
I'm Duncan.
Oh, I'm the home assistant. Kate.

172 
Hi.
Hi.

173 
Is that Kate?
Yeah it's me, Ruthie.

174 
How ya feeling today, Ronnie?
You're runnin' a little hot, your pressure's up.

175 
It's cause you're here.

176 
His pressure's up because he was up to no good.
Shit.

177 
Follow the light.

178 
Follow.

179 
And who is the president?

180 
That slick dickweed in the suit.

181 
I didn't vote for him.

182 
And what's his name?
Hmm?

183 
The dickweed.  What's his name?

184 
Bob Hope.

185 
Ronald, what's his name?

186 
Duncan, who's the president?

187 
It's Bing Crosby.

188 

189 
For God's sake.
That's my grandson.

190 
He's a good'un.
Yeah.

191 
Best hockey player you ever seen.

192 
Skates like a goddamn Canuck.

193 
Good lookin' to boot.
You're blushing.

194 
His grandfather's embarrassing him.

195 
Duncan?
That's okay.

196 
I got him.

197 
He's a good one.

198 
Always there to help his grandfather.

199 
Okay, well I'll see you next week.

200 
Okay.

201 
Bye, Duncan.

202 
[Lady drops groceries]

203 
Oh, oh my.

204 
Let me get this for you.

205 
Oh, thanks!

206 
Thank you so much.

207 
Thank you.

208 
Bye.
Bye.

209 
Can you patch a wall?

210 
Yeah, I've been known to spackle.

211 
You ever go to jail?

212 
You steal?
[Shakes head "no"]

213 
No sir, but if I was a thief
I'd probably also be a liar.

214 
So it's kind of hard to trust
a guy either way, isn't it.

215 

216 
I've had a bit of a checkered
employment history but I need this job.

217 
For more than just me. I need to be in this
building and I promise you I will work my ass off.

218 
A promise from a thief and a liar?

219 
Okay.

220 
Tomorrow. Eight. Do not be late.
The guy before, always late.

221 
Sorry, my bad.

222 
[Trying to start car]
[Horns honking.  Drivers yelling.]

223 
Hey Stu. 
Hey numnuts.

224 
Whoa, whoa, stinky!

225 
Holy balls, the battery melted.  Must have
fallen off when you stomped on the brakes.

226 
See?

227 
Two posts hit the metal on the hood,
then POW!

228 
What do you mean, POW? It's a brand new battery.
Don't I know it, I sold it to you.

229 
At cost.

230 
You didn't attach those two brackets I gave you,
did you.  They're to keep the battery in place, dipshit.

231 
Well you never told me that did you.
Telling you now.

232 
I'll nose around and see if you didn't
smoke up the electricals too bad.

233 
Not that I want to make
 your car my life's work.

234 
Ah, you lack vision, Stu.

235 
Yeah but you gotta find something new.

236 
I can't afford something new. I
can't even afford to fix that piece.

237 
Yeah, we'll see what we can work out.
Maybe I can get you to plow for me.

238 
But, um...

239 
I'm just glad to help out.

240 
You know that was ten years ago?

241 
What's that?

242 
It's been ten years since dad died.
This week.

243 
Ten years?

244 
Oh man.

245 
I was thinking about him this weekend
watching the blow-job Vikings.

246 
God, he used to hate it when they'd try to
make a field goal from the one yard line.
He'd fucking scream out: ONE YARD?

247 
Give it to me I'll carry it three fuckin' feet.

248 
Drive me fuckin' nuts.

249 
Yeah.

250 
Anyway, thanks for the ride. 
See you.
[Door closes]

251 
Did you want to make out with me?
Hey, don't hit on the redhead.
  I don't appreciate it.

252 
[Yo Judas. Hey Arnold.]
[What's happenin' ladies.]

253 
So you win tonight?

254 
Not with that woman Hacksetter at goal.

255 
Hey hey hey

256 
You know I've seen better
hands on a snake.

257 
Where were you? We needed you.
  They killed us man, they literally killed us.

258 
You literally got killed.
That's interesting.

259 
You know Finn, maybe you shouldn't
use words that you don't understand.

260 
Hey, dumb ass, I didn't mean
literally as in "literally."

261 
Well, how else could you possibly
mean it, college boy?

262 
Oh, oh college boy.

263 
Do you want a little of this ... ?

264 
... literally ...

265 
Knock it off you hooligans.
Hey stop it.

266 
What is this crap?
How am I supposed to pommel him to this?

267 
Sorry, that was uncalled for.
I apologize.

268 
[background singing]
"so all worthwhile"

269 
What's with the singing?
It's Hack's new scam.
  [It's hard]

270 
He plays this song and then he tells people
that his wife just left him and that
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" was her favorite show.

271 
Guarantees some poor slob buys him a drink.

272 
Every time.
So then, Hacksetter is actually
a horrible human being.

273 
Oh, a horrible human being by all accounts.

274 

275 
But at least that horror showed up to the game.
Where were you, dipstick?
We needed you man. We had six.

276 
No subs, no subs.
And chunky butt here's not in good shape.
Don't call me chunky.
  ... cry about it later fatty.

277 
I got stuck at my grandparents' place
and my goddamn car broke down again.

278 
Christ almighty on a crutch, would
you please just buy a new one already.

279 
With what, Finn?

280 
Get a job, fuckup.
Uh, I got a job but now I don't
have a car to get me to the job.

281 
Wait, what, what, what? You have a job?
Oh my God, you sellout, what are you doing?

282 
Well, you know, I'm gonna be working at an
apartment building. Going to be a maintenance man.

283 
What, like handyman?

284 
Like, a ... tool belt, like that guy Schneider
on the TV show, "Hey Miss Romano"?

285 
Unbelievable.
That works every time.

286 
Shit, that was fast.

287 
Like under two minutes, man.

288 
A record.
Hey Lindy, can you give me
  a ride to work tomorrow?

289 
Hell no. That's like 10 minutes out
of my way, 20 minutes during rush hour.

290 
You don't even know where he works.

291 
That's not the point.

292 
Come on man.  Don't make me fight the
bus. Now I've gotta figure out the
fares and schedule and the transfers and

293 

294 
Why not do what you normally do.
Don't show up and get fired
and whine about it.

295 
Nope, I actually need this job.

296 
Then you better get on the bus, Gus.

297 
Okay, you knock.

298 
Why me?

299 
She's crazy.  She do not answer door
if a black man knocks. You knock.

300 

301 
Maintenance.

302 
Two of you.

303 
I don't like that.
I don't like that one bit.

304 
I'm watching you.

305 
Oh boy.

306 
Ronald, did you hear that?

307 
Duncan is now working in the
building. He started this morning.

308 
The building?

309 
He works at the bank.
No, that's Jake, grampa.

310 
Jacob works in the bank.
I'm going to be a handyman here.

311 
Handy man.

312 
You don't even know the difference
between hammers, do you?

313 
Are you kidding, I worked for you
all those summers.

314 
You don't know a hammer from your dick.

315 
Ronald!

316 
Don't worry, I know my hammers, old man.

317 
Then can grab me a ball peen
from my toolbox.

318 
It's under the sink.

319 
Sure, sure I'll be right back.

320 
No, make that a claw, wise-ass.

321 

322 
Come on, honey, let's do this.
See?

323 
That's not a claw.

324 
Oh, yeah it is.

325 
Is it good?

326 
Let me see it.

327 
Ruth?
[mmm?]

328 
Cover your eyes.

329 
What?
Cover your eyes.

330 

331 
What a mess.
The ball's there.

332 

333 
[Loud music]
Do you want a ride?

334 
Okay.

335 
Thanks.

336 
What's wrong with him?

337 
Well, he's got Parkinson's and the kidney
problems and his heart is a little shaky.

338 
But your grandma's main concern
is that he might have the A-bomb.

339 
Alzheimer's?

340 
Yeah, she wants me to keep an eye on it.

341 
Apparently he had a brother who had it.

342 
Yeah, Sterling.

343 
But he was one of those crazy northwood
types to begin with so when he lost his
mind it wasn't all that easy to tell.

344 
You know I just mostly [Whoa]

345 
What are you doing?
Alright, I got it.
  I can drive with my knee.

346 
You've never seen that before?
Look. I'm turning.
Well, I need to turn here.

347 
Yeah with hands.
I just think he's more
  depressed than anything.

348 
You know?

349 
But he talks about you a lot.

350 
Don't believe anything that's
coming out of his mouth.

351 
Well, he's got some good stories
about you and your brother David.

352 
That's Jacob.

353 
David is my dad.

354 
 Oh.

355 
And I just find it's hard
to meet people around here.

356 
But that's not true.

357 
Yes it is.  Okay, I bet that you've known
all your friends since the fourth grade.

358 
Am I right?
Yeah, but I'm not a good example.
  I don't get out much.

359 
Besides, where have you lived
that's any different?

360 
Oh, Portland, Seattle, Jackson Hall, Atlanta, Boston.

361 
Hey Dunc.
Hey Mishak. [Sorry]
You gonna come watch the game?

362 
Of course. I'll be there. I'll see you there.

363 
Go Vikings!
[Vikings! Woo! You know it, baby!]

364 
Okay, what is up with
everyone watching the game?

365 
Women watch the Vikings game.

366 
Gay guys watch.  People who have
absolutely no interest in football watch.

367 
I met this guy in the orchestra, and
he couldn't go to the movies with me
on Sunday because he had to watch the game.

368 
And I was like dude you're a violinist.

369 
It's not even about the football.

370 
It's a loyalty thing.

371 
Tell me.

372 
To the team, to the guys
you watch the game with.

373 
And you know you gotta remember
that we're in Minneapolis, there's
not really a lot to do here.

374 
No, but you're so wrong.
  This is a great place to live.

375 
Just not here in my neighborhood.

376 
Yeah, this is a little more adventurous
than my place over in St. Paul.

377 
Saint what?

378 
St. Paul. It's on the other side of the river.

379 
Never heard of it.

380 
Wow, does this smart-ass junior-high
routine work with all the ladies?

381 
Not yet.

382 
And the sad thing is I actually thought
I was carrying on an adult conversation.

383 

384 
You working a puzzle?

385 
My damn hand shakes so much.

386 
I can't do it.

387 
Afraid I might shove a piece right up my ass.

388 
Oh I don't think you're doing it quite right.

389 
I got no interest in it.

390 
Got an interest in that sandwich, though.

391 
Right here?
-Right there.

392 
Good!

393 
Got mustard?

394 
I could have been mayor.

395 
How about that.

396 
Had my campaign fund, everything.
[Thanks.]

397 
Mayor Shorter.

398 
Didn't do it, though.

399 
Good.

400 
You know...

401 
... shoulda done it.

402 
[See you tomorrow.]

403 
Hey!

404 
Young fella.

405 
Come here.

406 
We need a fourth.
Will you sit in and play with us?

407 
You deal.  You deal.

408 
Take your hat off.

409 
Okay, what's your poison?

410 
[Loud music]

411 
I love this room!

412 
11:30.

413 
Oh my God! Billy and the Bronzed Gods.

414 
I know couple of these guys
from when I lived in Austin.

415 
I've seen these guys before.

416 
Like when they were in their
replacements phase.

417 
Do you know their replacements
is why I came here?

418 
Oh God, you're one of those.
No, I'm not.

419 
Wait, one of what?

420 
One of those people who moved
to Minneapolis because you thought
it would be like a replacement song.

421 
You mean there are others?

422 
Aw, I can't believe that. Shit.
When am I going to have an original thought?

423 
I don't know.
Now you're just one of the masses.

424 
Hunting down Paul Westerberg
so you can tell him that his
music saved your life.

425 
Yeah, so. No, you know what,
I just want to meet him once.

426 
You know, just to ...

427 
maybe look adoringly at him
and smell his hair.

428 
Do you think that's crazy?

429 
Yes!

430 
But I'm glad you're here anyway.

431 
[Last call.  Drink up and get out.]

432 
What are you doing tomorrow?

433 
Gonna hang out and watch the Vikings game.

434 
Anyhoo, working on a whole new thing right?

435 
It's going to make Hacksetter a
little more appealing to the ladies.
Oh yeah, you getting yourself a facelift?

436 
Pretendin' to be an Indian.

437 
Really? An Indian.

438 
And that's going to make you more attractive?
Oh yeah.
  It's gonna give me a whole sense of mystery.

439 
Or exoticness.

440 
Like I'm not going to come right out and say...

441 
Hi, I'm a quarter Chippewa. No.

442 
You know,
I'm going to be casual about it.

443 
You know.  I'll refer to the president
as uh, the Great White Father.

444 
And uh, someway bring up, uh

445 
uh whatever one of them, Lake Superior,
Lake Superior I'm a, you know, say or as 
as my people call it ...

446 
Gitchigumi, or whatever they say.

447 
Next thing you know

448 
back at the sweat lodge, man.

449 
That is a good plan that is
going to get you scalped.

450 
Mmm.

451 
It is going to give me a lot.

452 
Scalped and then some.
Maybe they'll skin me.
Whole.

453 

454 
Yep.

455 
It's fried, Sparky.

456 
Well I'm broke, Stu.

457 
If it costs a nickel to get to
the north pole I couldn't make
it as far as Duluth.

458 
Ronald, Duncan's here.

459 
Ronald?
[grunts] Yeah, yeah.

460 
Just finishing.

461 
What's it do?
It's a sculpture. It doesn't
do anything. You look at it.

462 
It's big cherry in a goddamn big spoon.

463 
Oh the shit.
Remember when you used to
  tell Jake and me to go outside
  and blow the stink off?

464 
Ehh, you two could drive me nuts.
Well, you're driving grandma nuts
  so we're blowing the stink off, old man.

465 
Hardware.

466 
Goddamn, hardware!

467 
7-6 ...

468 
I can tell just by the feel.

469 
I lost his store and he died.

470 
Same year.

471 
That's a long time ago, now.

472 
You got a raw deal
but you turned out alright.

473 
Gosh Christ. Look at that, will ya?

474 
Yeah.

475 
Must be 1950, for God's sakes.

476 
I'll do something for you some someday.

477 
You turned out all right you know.

478 
You go hunting.  You need shells?

479 
I could get you some shotgun shells.

480 
I'm good thanks.

481 
Want to get some for me, then?

482 
What the hell do you need shells for?

483 
You do a lot of hunting
up there on the sixth floor?

484 
Is she hot?

485 
You're was such an asshole.
I'm just asking.

486 
Well I'll have to check with Cara.
She has a very precise table plan
at Thanksgiving. Another person
may throw it off.

487 
You know how she can get.

488 
You know, it's been ten years.

489 
No, not 'til grandma told me.
You know it's kind of a female
thing to remember dates and
anniversaries like that, isn't it?

490 
He's our dad, dickhead.

491 
Don't you ever think about him?

492 
Well I know if he were here right
now he'd be flipping you shit
for missing that deer.

493 
Uh, Duncan, on your next shot
I want you to scare it my way
so I can hit it.

494 
I always hated hunting anyhow.

495 
I just liked going out in the
woods with you guys.

496 
Really?  That's gay.

497 
Hey, don't tell Cara you hate it.
She thinks we're going up north
the last weekend of pheasant season.

498 
Lemme guess.

499 
You're holding another meeting
of the Bimbo-of-the-Month club.

500 
Yeah, going to a bed and
breakfast down south.

501 
Why?

502 
Cause I'm tired of fucking her
in Minneapolis, want to fuck her
in Rochester for a change.

503 
Then I'll fuck her in Dubuque for a change.

504 
You know, I could just shoot you
out here and tell everybody it was
an accident.

505 
Hey, don't joke about shit like that.

506 
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend
your delicate sensibilities.

507 
You're not my brother.

508 
Oh right, my high school dropout
loser mooch brother disowns me.
Whaddya doing? Whoa. Quit
fucking around D, it's not funny.

509 
Shut up. Deer.

510 
Now now wait wait for me.
Just, shh, I got it.

511 
[Misses, deliberately]

512 
Not even close.

513 
I love Thanksgiving.
I mean the idea of it anyway.

514 
Because I never had the big family Thanksgiving.
What are you doing this year?

515 
Oh, the usual.

516 
You know, curl up with a bottle of gin.

517 
Then pie.

518 
Well, uh, my brother's having
everybody out to his place to
 eat and pray. That might be cool.

519 
What is that, like a half-ass
Duncan version of an invitation?

520 
Alright.

521 
Alright, a big family Thanksgiving.
Count me in, I'll do it.

522 
Yeah?
Yeah.

523 
Good. Aw, good,
 'cause I needed a ride.

524 
Such an asshole.

525 
I just wanna watch one of these
big bitches crash already.
Wouldn't that be cool?

526 
Well, Beavis, you're aiming
at the wrong bitches.

527 
That is, the big bitches have a
base proportional to the height.
You can't break 'em. You should
aim for the little bitches on the side.

528 
You love these icicles, don't you?

529 
I just like knowin' how things
are put together, how they're built.

530 
What, like an architect?

531 
You could do that.

532 
Well no, architecture is more about
how things look and I don't give a
shit how things look.

533 
I like how they're designed,
and engineered.

534 
Which is why I like this bridge.

535 
Some things are built to last,
and some things just fall apart.

536 
Which one are you?

537 
Aww, I can't believe it.

538 
Can't believe you got one before I did.

539 
Kind of embarrassing.

540 

541 
Grampa?  Grampa.

542 
What's going on?

543 
I wanted to watch the Today Show.

544 
Well you're scaring grandma.

545 
Bull shit.

546 
Ruth!  Ruth!

547 
She's downstairs in the lobby right now crying.

548 
For Christ's sakes.

549 
Did you actually tell her that
I was going to buy you shotgun shells?

550 
That was between her and me.
Well congratulations,
  I'm in the middle of it now.

551 
And what the hell is this?
Yeah yeah yeah.  It's empty.

552 
Well then what are you doing with it?

553 
Give me a shell.

554 
What?
Just need one.

555 
This is what you wanted, right?
You wanted your TV so you threw a tantrum.

556 
My brother I shoulda.

557 
Sterling your ...

558 
Life of the party, he was.
Couldn't put together two words at
the end. They put him in one of them...

559 
He didn't know where he was.

560 
Thought he was living at the airport.

561 
I shoulda, he would have thanked me.
Well, I know exactly where you are.

562 
You're in your living room with your team.

563 
You got what you wanted.
Are you happy now?

564 
Because now you gotta do two things for me.

565 
First, stop scaring grandma with this shit.

566 
If you do this again I swear old man,
I will beat you senseless.

567 
What's the other thing?

568 
I want you to go to Jake's for Thanksgiving.

569 
I don't like people seeing me like this.

570 
Is that what this is about?
You're embarrased?

571 
I'm not embarrassed, you little shit.

572 
Not of me.  This isn't me.
You think this is me?

573 
Alright, that should do it.

574 
There you go.

575 
Just like new.

576 
Hold on.

577 
Always trying to steal.
Rob ya blind unless you catch 'em.
Sneaky bastards.

578 
You have a lovely day Mrs. Hollerich.

579 
I just don't know about this. I mean the
recipe I got it was from a woman with ALS.
Okay don't worry about it.

580 
It's not like anybody was
going to eat 'em anyhow.

581 
I'm sorry.  That was a bad joke.
I was just kidding.

582 
Okay but maybe we shouldn't do this.
It just doesn't feel right
and they might not like

583 
what I made and I don't even
fucking like sweet potatoes.
Hey, calm down, you're nervious.

584 
I get that it's your first big
family Thanksgiving dinner but

585 
I got your back, I promise.
And if we sit down, you don't
 like it, lemme know, and I will
 whisk you away to safety.

586 
I promise.  Okay?
Okay.

587 
Deep breath.

588 
You good to go?
mm Hmm.

589 
Excellent.

590 
Yuck.
 Oh.

591 
Hey, girls.
 Happy Thanksgiving!

592 
Daddy,

593 
Uncle Duncan's here.

594 
What, no hug?

595 
Hey. Alright, go play.

596 
What's up, shithead.
Happy Thanksgiving.

597 
Hi, you must be Kate. Nice to meet you.
 Hi, I brought sweet potatoes.

598 
Great, well come on in,
I'll get you a drink.

599 
I'm such a fan of stuffing.
You want some more?

600 
She's gonna have to put him in a home soon.
You know that. Look at him.

601 
He's fine, Jake.
Just takes a little patience.

602 
Okay.

603 
Cara, this is turkey is amazing.
Oh, yeah.

604 
I hope so.
I've been basting it for two days.

605 
Wow.

606 
Sweet potatoes are good.

607 
Duncan?

608 
Grampa's boots had some mud on them,
so now there's a mess in the foyer.

609 
Okay, I'll take care of that as soon as I can.

610 
Thank you.

611 
So, you're in a new place on the river.

612 
How do you like it?

613 
Why is he talking like that?

614 
We just love it, Tom, we love it.

615 
Yeah, there's some great views out
there of the river, both skylines.

616 
The girls love the elevator.
Fantastic.

617 
At night

618 
you can see the northern lights.

619 
Northern lights. Really [disbelief].

620 
I've seen them up north in Canada,
but down here?

621 
You can see them down here sometimes.

622 
This time of year in the city...

623 
He sees them so obviously they're there.
D?
Look, he sees them from the balcony.

624 
Hey, he sees them; it doesn't matter.

625 
Is it really important?

626 
Sorry, grandma.

627 
Do you know that there is some
tribal dancing that relieves stress?

628 
You have open your chest, kinda.

629 
Could be reflected city lights.
Ronald ...

630 
you sure?
Yeah.

631 
Yeah, I'm sure.
I lived up north seventy years.

632 
You think I never saw northern lights,
you think I don't know what they look like?

633 
I know what they are, you jackass.

634 
I saw 'em.  I see 'em.

635 
Turkey's a little dry.

636 
I loved it.
I loved every minute of it.

637 
The family tension
and the sweaters and the

638 
the little marshmallows on the dessert.

639 
It could have been worse,
my mom could have been there.

640 
Yeah, where is she?

641 
She moved down to Florida
when Jake went to college.

642 
I was actually supposed to move in
with her after dad died, but ...

643 
How could I go to Florida?

644 
There's no hockey down there.

645 
Well, it would be nice to visit her.

646 
I wouldn't know, actually.

647 
Because Jake takes his family down there,
but I only see her when she comes up
for a couple weeks in the summer.

648 
She hates the winters up here.

649 
Yeah, I can't say I blame her.

650 
I mean it's not even December

651 
and my nipples are so hard
they could cut glass.

652 
Is that a warning?

653 
I don't know.

654 
[Loud music]

655 
It's running good, all the electricals.
I changed the oil too.
Don't mention it.

656 
And you gotta watch that radiator.

657 
I filled it but it's gotta slow leak.

658 
Good to know.  Thank you.

659 
What is up with you? Are you high?

660 
No.

661 
I had too much turkey,
it makes me giddy.

662 
Mmm.
I remember when I used to get giddy.

663 
Stu?

664 
You know how some days when you wake
up the world just seems right?

665 
You know, everything comes together,
just feels like [interruption]
Holy ...

666 
You got laid.

667 
Huh.

668 
So, is it dangerous?

669 
Just if you walk by it.

670 
Or look at it.

671 
I, look, I'll just throw a
couple brackets under there to
distribute the weight more evenly.

672 
And by the time I'm finished
you'll be able to store a herd
of elephants up there.

673 
My, that should be handy.

674 
How's your grampa?

675 
He's doing fine.

676 
[Music...]

677 
[Music...]

678 
[Horn honks]

679 
[Learning to plow snow]

680 
[Fence, fence, fence!]

681 
[Gently, gently.]

682 
You know, you're really missing out,
staying in one place.

683 
You're missing chile rellenos
in Boston.

684 
You're missing crab cakes
in Baltimore.

685 
Uh, Brooklyn bagels,
grits in Georgia.

686 
You're just naming food.

687 
I know, I'm hungry.

688 
Then what's the next place?

689 
I like right here, right now.

690 
Just until you're done
stalking Westerberg, right?

691 
Hey listen, restraining orders
mean nothing to me.

692 
I actually have friends who've
seen him at the Wally's Roast Beef
down in Bloomington.

693 
Oh my God, that's amazing.
You have friends?

694 
Well, just the guys I've been
hanging around with since the
fourth grade.

695 
Yeah I know.
When am I gonna meet these guys?

696 
Ah, hope the snow keeps up.

697 
Probably take the sleds out tomorrow.

698 
You're gonna go sledding?

699 
Duncan, that is so quaint,
that's so nineteenth century.

700 
Can I come?

701 

702 
[I feel like James Bond.]

703 
[You drive like a girl.]

704 
I can't feel my toes.

705 
I think some skin came off with that.

706 
My teeth are so frozen.

707 
I love you.
No I love you.
[That's disgusting.]

708 
He's eighty two.

709 
But he's still pretty active.

710 
I mean he fishes, and complains
about the government, anyway.

711 
My grandfather's just sitting out on his
balcony watching the northern lights.

712 
Waiting for the end.

713 
Hey hey.

714 
What's in it?

715 
We don't know.
Hacksetter makes it.

716 
He calls it firewater.

717 
Oh, careful.

718 
Ugh.

719 
Dr. Pepper and Robitussin.

720 
Nice, here I'll take some of that.

721 
You know a lot of Indian tribes

722 
Oh Jesus, Hack, don't pull
that Indian shit on me.

723 
No, this is serious man, I've done

724 
lots of research on it.

725 
Lot of tribes feel that
when person is ready

726 
they just die.

727 
They, uh, fulfilled
their missions and

728 
taught all their lessons and uh,

729 
they're ready to move onto the next world.

730 
You still see their souls passing

731 
the northern lights.

732 
They sort of just quietly

733 
expire.

734 
You're full of shit. That's the
old Indian guy from "The Outlaw
Josie Wales." I've seen that movie.

735 
Okay it was pretty cool though,
you gotta admit.

736 
This Indian shit works. Even you
kinda wanted a little Hacksetter
action, didn't ya.

737 
You know, Kate, and excuse the
impertinence of this question, but

738 
What the hell are you doin' with Duncan?

739 
Yeah, I mean haven't you
noticed that you're

740 
way out of his league.

741 
Hey listen guys,
I tell him that all the time.

742 
I mean we're his best friends
so we know what a fuck-up he really is.

743 
Wow, did you ever think it might
not help to have his best friends
calling him a fuck-up?

744 
What, what do you mean, we made him
drop out of school and piss his life away?
I destroyed his life?

745 
No, that was Michak.
Oh come on, don't be so hard on him.

746 
He was the best hockey player
I ever played with.

747 
He was skating varsity in the
eighth grade. He could have
had a scholarship pay for
college right there.

748 
He just quit.
He had so much potential and he just quit.

749 
Why did he quit?
I don't know.  Drive you crazy
  trying to figure out why that
  guy does anything.
I got my theory.

750 
Oh yeah?
Yeah.

751 
Yeah?

752 
You know when you're a teenager

753 
and you rebel against your parents,

754 
shave your head, pierce your ass,
that kind of crap?

755 
Everybody does.
Everybody does it.

756 
But Dunc

757 
never got a chance to rebel because

758 
his dad, when his dad died
he was still god to him,

759 
and that's what happens when your god dies.

760 
Wow, Lindy.

761 
That's tremendously profound.

762 
Why don't you lick my ball sack, Finn.

763 
Oh.
Oh, would you like that?

764 
Ball sack is never really necessary,

765 
to say, out loud, you know?
Now I'm going to have

766 
[Taking a picture]
Balls.  Balls.

767 
Got it!

768 
Oh, Jesus.

769 
Oops.

770 
Do you want me to drive?
I don't mind driving at all.
No! I'm good.

771 
People keep warning me about you.

772 
Dunc.

773 
I can't believe I'm having sex
with a guy named Dunc.

774 
But I can't believe
I'm having sex, period.

775 
Ha, aww.

776 
How did your father die?

777 
Um, the usual way.
He stop breathing.

778 
Keep your eyes on the road.
It gets really icy here in the winter.

779 
It's dangerous.
How old were you?

780 
I was 15 and he was 39.

781 
And he died of a heart attack.

782 
God that's so young.

783 
Yeah, you think?

784 
Oh?

785 
It is young, but

786 
it was the lifestyle that he was living.

787 
It was the eighties and his business
was doing really good so

788 
you know why save all that money
when you can shovel it up your nose.

789 
But he was, you know,
he was in rehab for the

790 
last couple of years.

791 
He got sober but that night he just went
over to his buddy's, to his house and

792 
was playing poker...
look watch out... slow down

793 
I can drive.
I know you can drive, but 
people go into this ditch all the time.
I can see the road.

794 
Okay. It's just ...
It's gone.
[Duncan sighs]

795 
He died.  He went to his
 buddy's, to his house and

796 
he was playing poker with his
old drug buddies and Stu
was his dealer, and he died.

797 
And ...

798 
I think

799 
it's possible that

800 
maybe he did a couple of lines
with the guys that night knowing
that it would have killed him.

801 
I dunno. I just...

802 
Stu's the only guy who really
knows what happened.

803 
And uh,

804 
And I've never had the balls to ask
him because I think I'm a little
afraid of what the truth might be.

805 
Yeah.

806 
Why did you tell me that about your dad?

807 
Thanks for telling me.

808 
Kate.

809 
Kate.
Hey.

810 
Uh, god.

811 
I'm sorry I'm late.
You have to make it up to me the hard way.

812 
How about some brownies
from Mrs. Nigard in room 704?

813 
A little harder than that.

814 
Really?
Yeah.

815 
Okay. You know, you really shouldn't be
out here by yourself in this neighborhood.

816 
Really?  Well you know ain't nobody
gonna mess with a girl who's 
carrying a copy of Bullitt.

817 
With Steve McQueen.

818 
Why is it that we can't go
to your place, again?

819 
I like your place.
It's got nice lighting, and ...

820 
Hey Jake, what's up?

821 
Oh.

822 
Kate, this is Sandy. 
Sandy, this is Kate.

823 
Hi.

824 
Hi Sandy.

825 
What are you doing, D?

826 
We got a video
so we came to watch the video.

827 
Steve McQueen.

828 
Lotta action.

829 
We should go.
Yeah.  - Okay. - Yeah.

830 
Oh, you guys are leaving.
That's terrible.

831 
Sorry, have fun.
Okay.

832 
Wow. That is creepy.

833 
That kinda reminds me that Jack
Lemmon movie where he lends his
apartment to the boss.

834 
That's where he got the idea.

835 
And you let him do this because ...

836 
I work at Wentworth sometimes.
It's a good nursing home.

837 
Yeah?
-Yeah.

838 
Good. Maybe I'll move there.

839 
I think I'm getting a touch of
the A-bomb myself.

840 
You know Ruth isn't going to be able
to take care of him much longer.

841 
Just in the last month his
dementia has progressed.

842 
I dummo.
He seemed pretty good today.

843 
Ready for the movie?

844 
Wait what is this?
University of Minneapolis?

845 
I'm so impressed with you.

846 
Dingus McDonkey?

847 
Address: 666 Your Ass

848 
That's smart.
Why all the juvenile shit?

849 
Because, I started filling it out,
and it's stupid.

850 
You need a bunch of random bullshit
for it: your high school transcripts

851 
recommendations, you gotta write
a fucking essay, it's just dumb.

852 
Plus, I probably wouldn't get in anyhow.

853 
Maybe you wouldn't.

854 
But Dingus definitely won't.

855 
You know the great thing about
Dingus McDonkey?

856 
He's a real bobcat in the sack.

857 
Hey, it's a joke.

858 
Yeah, exactly.

859 
It's a joke.

860 
Ha ha ha.

861 
You're actually really good
at these exercises, Ronny.

862 
And your legs are quite strong.

863 
Those used to be like tree trunks.

864 
Now does this hurt, or are you
pretending like you did last time?

865 
Oh god. Everything hurts.

866 
Ha.

867 
Alright.

868 
Point and flex, you know the drill.

869 
The day you met Duncan

870 
I just pretended to
fall out of the chair

871 
so he'd come and help me
and you'd see what

872 
a good guy he is,

873 
helping an old man.

874 
Well it worked,
you crafty old matchmaker you.

875 
You're good for him.

876 
Like you are with me and these exercises.

877 
He needs someone being hard on him.

878 
You've gotta help him.

879 
I'm not sure I know how to help him, Ronny.

880 
Yes, you do.

881 
Just keep on at him like you been doin'.

882 
You and me.

883 
We'll help him, Katie.

884 
You're cheating, Gunderson.
I know you are, you're hiding
cards, aren't you?

885 

886 
Take his oxygen tank.

887 
[More laughing]

888 
You ARE cheating,
you old son of a bitch.

889 
And under your ass too,
that's disgusting.

890 
We've been playing in this place for years.

891 
Yeah you'll probably be playing
for another couple of decades.

892 
Ha ha, at least until Finn
runs his dad's business into the ground.

893 
Hey, you remember my friend Anna?

894 
Yeah, Anna from San Diego right?
Yeah.

895 
She called me the other night.
She wanted me to

896 
to move.

897 
Move where, to San Diego?

898 
Yeah, there's this couple and they're

899 
going to Europe for a year, and their
house-sitter fell through so she
wanted to know if I want to stay there.

900 
And it's like a couple blocks from
the beach, so there's gonna be
ocean and sunshine and fish tacos.

901 
What do you think?

902 
San Diego so great why are those people leavin'?

903 
Because people go places, Duncan.

904 
Look what the cat dragged in.
A Duncan.

905 

906 

907 
Your girlfriend's here, right?

908 
Fuck you, take the goddamn
game seriously.

909 

910 
We're on the same team.

911 
Hey, what's wrong with you.  Laugh!

912 
Get off me.
What's wrong with you, anyway.
... it's a goddamn game.

913 
Let's go get a beer, Finn.

914 
Why don't you come?

915 
So then that's it.
You've made up your mind.

916 
No, um, but I would
have to be there in January.

917 
Um, what are you going to do for work?

918 
I am a healthcare professional.
So there's always sick people.

919 
What, I don't get this, Kate.
How you can,

920 
how you can pack up everything
that you have here and just
leave it behind.

921 
What do I have here besides you?

922 
Why, that's not enough?

923 
Oh.

924 
Okay, that's not enough,
well that's good to know.

925 
I don't know, I thought you were joking.

926 
No, I'm being serious.  Surprise!

927 
Okay, well I can't tell what's
what's serious to you.
I'm being serious right now.

928 
I just watched you get in a fight
like a 12-year-old.

929 
And that guy was on the same team as you.

930 
Well he had it fucking coming.
He was being a jackass, and
that's not the point that's hockey.

931 
You don't even know hockey.
It's such bullshit.

932 
Why are you trying to pick a
fight with me? This is stupid.

933 
You know what?  Have a good time
in San Diego. I'm going home.
It's too cold for this.

934 
I thought we were having an
adult conversation.
Good night!

935 
Quit sulking, Ronald.

936 
Duncan is going to take you
to the store tomorrow.

937 
I thought we'd play cards,
penny a point, quarter a game.

938 
You used to love cards.

939 
You had a lot of interests.
You know, you liked woodworking
and hunting and dancing.

940 
Huh.

941 
We used to go dancing every
Saturday night.

942 
At the Legion.

943 
But I never had an interest
in it, sweetheart.

944 
You loved dancing.

945 
I loved being close to you.

946 
Holding your hand.

947 
That's all.

948 
I had an interest in you.

949 
Just holding your hand.

950 
I love you, sweetheart.

951 
I love you too.

952 
[music lyrics ...]
I need no soft lights

953 
to enchant me.

954 
It's true.

955 
Only grant me

956 
The right

957 
To hold you ever so tight.

958 
And to feel in the night

959 
The nearness of you.
[End of song]

960 
[Car won't start]

961 
[Finished?]
 Just about.

962 
I'll go on balcony in December.
Very cold.

963 
I gotta bird feeder out there.
For the birds, and some squirrels.

964 
Okay.

965 
There you go, all finished.

966 
I dunno how exactly he could
have taken anything. You were
with him the whole time.
Sneaky.

967 
Thief! This is mine! Thief. I'm calling the police.
I don't know how that got in there, Mrs. Hollerich.

968 
My husband's medals.
Thief. Robbing me blind.

969 
But you know I didn't take that
tin. It was an accident.

970 
Not to crazy woman.
She sees you taking,
that's only thing that matters.

971 
If she calls the police you are fired.

972 
I am fired.

973 
I'm sorry, my friend, I'm sorry.

974 
The woman is just a nightmare.  She only keeps
that there because she's crazy. Honestly, who
keeps stuff hidden under the kitchen sink?

975 
She's lonesome, Duncan, not crazy.
Do you want me to talk to her?  I can try.

976 
No, forget it.
There's no point. Look, I've,

977 
I've been fired from better jobs
than this one.

978 
I was only here because of him.

979 
So you're just going to give up?

980 
Why should I put up with all this shit?

981 
But she said you stole a box of medals.
But I didn't steal anything.

982 
That's what I'm telling you, grandma.  I didn't steal a
thing. For once in my life I didn't actually do anything wrong.
I know but they'll say you did.

983 
And I didn't raise you just to accept [interrupted].
No, you're right. You didn't raise me.
  You didn't, my dad didn't.

984 
My mother certainly fucking didn't.

985 
So you tell me, who did?  Who
raised me because they did a crap job.

986 
[Ronald: Come on, kiddo.]

987 
Let's go blow the stink off.

988 
[Ronald: Hurry up.]

989 
So that's it.

990 
She's leaving me here and she's going to San Diego.
San Diego?

991 
That's where the war is.
Uh, yeah, we're going to be closing up in
about five minutes.  Do you two need anything?

992 
You got shotgun shells?

993 
Don't listen to him, we're fine.
We'll be outta your hair in a sec.

994 
You know if you were serious about
this suicide business you wouldn't
need shotgun shells.

995 
Just drop a toaster in the tub or
throw yourself off the balcony.

996 
Why don't you go?

997 
What's that?
Why can't you go to San Diego?

998 
Because I got things here, grampa.

999 
All my friends are here, Jake
and the girls, you and grandma.

1000 
Ruth.

1001 
She can take care of herself
damned well, believe me.

1002 
You got a raw deal kiddo.
[Hands.]

1003 
Your dad.

1004 
Think about him, how he died.

1005 
I didn't, didn't help him.

1006 
He needed me.

1007 
I shoulda helped him.

1008 
He's gone.

1009 
What were we talking about?

1010 
Yeah, alright.

1011 
I'm the mayor.
[Good night, sir.]

1012 
Hump.

1013 
Ok, bye.
Bye.

1014 

1015 
I'm thinking maybe you're right.
Jesus Christ. D.

1016 
What are you doing?

1017 
I know it's sad, D,
but it'd be better for him.

1018 
He's suicidal.

1019 
Yeah right, can you see him
jumping off the balcony?

1020 
He asked me to buy him shotgun shells.

1021 
Anybody who talks about killing
themselves isn't really going to do it.

1022 
Whadda you know about it, anyway?

1023 
I think dad would have done it.
For the love of fuck, D, would you
  just shut up about dad? He's not here.
  It doesn't matter what he would have done.

1024 
You know something.
He never made good decisions when he was.

1025 
Well, he'd have known what to do.

1026 
Yeah, he was just a man, Duncan.

1027 
Hey.

1028 
Last week, did you tell Kate
what was going on?  With Sandy?

1029 
I can't let you use my apartment anymore.

1030 
I just don't feel good about it.

1031 
She think I'm a scumbag?

1032 
I don't know, Jacob.

1033 
You think you're a scumbag?

1034 
You're freezing, you want to go inside?

1035 
No, the cold is good for you.
It's invigorating.

1036 
My dad used to say that when you can

1037 
see your breath it means you're still alive.

1038 
Okay, so Kate, look, I've been thinking,

1039 
and

1040 
you can't leave yet.

1041 
You just you can't go okay,
you can't go to San Diego.

1042 
Because whatever it is that you're
running from we can take care of it here.

1043 
You can solve it here.
Whatever I'm running from?  I'm not running
from anything.  I'm running to things, to opportunity.
No, I'm I'm calling bullshit on that because

1044 
to run to something you have to run from somewhere.

1045 
And that, that's what you do Kate.

1046 
You you you run away from places because it's
easier for you. You're not attached to anything
so you never get hurt, right?

1047 
I mean, be honest.
Is there a guy like me in every town?

1048 
I don't think there's a guy like you anywhere.

1049 
You can always come with me, you know.

1050 
To San Diego.

1051 
Somebody else actually suggested
that too, but...

1052 
he's losing his mind.

1053 
What's keeping you here?
Your friends?

1054 
The Vikings?
Your misguided sense of loyalty?

1055 
Kate,

1056 
I'm loyal because these people stay.

1057 
They stay here and
I like things the way that they are.

1058 
The way they are or the way that they were?

1059 
Look, you said it yourself,
this is a good place.

1060 
Yes it is, but you'd have to go
to other places to know that.

1061 
Do you think your father would want you
to stay here for eternity, chained to his
memory, chained to your grampa?

1062 
That's not loyalty Duncan,
that's just being afraid.

1063 
You know what?  Fuck you Kate.
Why?

1064 
You don't ...

1065 
You just ...

1066 
You think this is fun for me?

1067 
Saying goodbye?

1068 
I liked you before I even met you.

1069 
From Ruthie's pictures
and Ronald's stories.

1070 
And then when I met you ...

1071 
you remember that?

1072 
It was just familiar.

1073 
I don't know why.

1074 
I don't know why.

1075 
[Background music...]

1076 
Hey grampa.

1077 
Grampa?

1078 
Grampa!

1079 
Hey.

1080 
You okay?

1081 
David?

1082 
No grampa, it's Duncan.

1083 
Duncan?

1084 
Duncan Duncan Duncan.

1085 
Oh Christ.  Oh.

1086 
You'd think they could have stayed open
a bit longer for the mayor, huh?

1087 
Whoa.

1088 
Well.

1089 
What do you say we go buy a
Christmas present for grandma?

1090 
Christmas?
Yeah.

1091 
Yeah.

1092 
Disgusting, isn't it?

1093 
I need, uh.
What?

1094 
What? Whaddya need?
The place.  Where I go.

1095 
A bathroom?

1096 
Yes, urinal. Urinal. Urinal.
Ok, hold on.
Hurry. Goddamn fountains.

1097 
I should get you a handicap parking sticker.

1098 
My legs are frozen.

1099 
You alright?
I'll be right outside this door.

1100 
The zipper, the zipper.

1101 
Oh God I'm sorry kiddo.

1102 
I'm going, I'm going and I can't stop.

1103 
I can't stop.

1104 
I got it. I got it.  Okay.

1105 
Alright. Tilt down a little bit.

1106 
Okay

1107 
Okay.

1108 
You got it from here?

1109 
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.
Aw Jesus. Okay.
   There we go. There we go.

1110 
I'm done.

1111 
Yeah?

1112 
You don't need to wring it out, you know.

1113 
Christ, I gotta go wash my hands.

1114 
Gotta wash my dick.

1115 
I don't know where your hand's been.

1116 
Alright, let's get you home.
Unless you actually want to do
some more Christmas shopping.

1117 
Soaking wet.
I gotta change my pants.

1118 
Uncle Duncan!

1119 
Ooh.  Hey.  Hey. ... Hi.

1120 
What are you doing?

1121 
Uhh, just doing a little Christmas
shopping with grampa.

1122 
No, I mean what are you doing, you doing here?
You're supposed to be up north hunting.

1123 
Oh yeah, yeah.  The hunting trip.

1124 
Yeah, hey girls, why don't you
give your grampa a hug?

1125 
Say hi to grampa.
I'm all wet, sweetheart, I spilled my coffee.

1126 
So.

1127 
What happened?

1128 
Why, I couldn't go.

1129 
I lost my job and uh,

1130 
I've been helping out with grandma and
grampa which takes up a bunch of time,
so I couldn't make it.

1131 
Yeah, Jacob didn't um,

1132 
mention that to me, so

1133 
I just...

1134 
Say goodbye to your grandfather, please.

1135 
Bye grampa.
Bye girls, bye.
Bye grampa.

1136 
Oh, it's good to see you.

1137 
Bye bye.

1138 
Bye.
Merry Christmas.

1139 
What's her name?

1140 
Cara.

1141 
It could have been worse.

1142 
Yeah.

1143 
I coulda shit myself.
Sterling did that all the time at the end.

1144 
Like a goddamn baby.

1145 
Alright, up you go.

1146 
He would have told me to do it.

1147 
Put him out of his misery.

1148 
But he lost his sense.
Well, you haven't lost your sense, old man.

1149 
Those moments come, kiddo.

1150 
Faster and faster.

1151 
Before you know it, it'll be all the time.

1152 
Like under water.

1153 
Then I won't have the brains to

1154 
ask you to help me.

1155 
Oh, for Christ sakes, enough of this, old man.

1156 
Think of grandma.
I am.

1157 
Imagine what that woman could do [if]

1158 
she didn't have me dragging her down.
I gotta get you ready, she's going to be home soon.

1159 
Yeah she's out at class, trying to live.

1160 
I'm like a dead weight.

1161 
Holding her back from her life, David.

1162 
Stop doing that.

1163 
This is David. I'm Duncan.
I know you know the difference, old man.

1164 
Stop doing that.

1165 
I loved him.

1166 
I wasn't a good enough
father to him, Duncan.

1167 
Nothing's been the same.

1168 
He's gone, isn't he?

1169 
Yes.

1170 
Yes, he's gone, grampa.

1171 
He would have helped me.

1172 
He loved me.

1173 
He would have pulled the goddamn

1174 
trigger if I'd asked him to.

1175 
Oh.

1176 
[Packing ...]

1177 
Grampa, what are you doing out there.
It's freezing.

1178 
Grampa.

1179 
Grampa.

1180 
This reminds me of the porch out here.

1181 
Remember the porch?

1182 
We used to sit out there eating
ice cream, you and me and Jake.

1183 
Jake always went inside early.

1184 
You'd stay on the porch with me.

1185 
Look at 'em dance.

1186 
Look at what, the stars?
The lights. The northern lights.

1187 
Aurora

1188 
Aurora

1189 
Aurora Borealis, grampa.

1190 
Colors are good tonight,

1191 
just like they used to be on the porch up north.

1192 
Your dad.

1193 
Only way I could get him to sit still.

1194 
He loved the lights.

1195 
Sit and watch him.

1196 
Okay, let's go inside.
If I was an eskimo.
Please grampa, let's go inside.
If I was an eskimo.

1197 
I'd just walk out into the snow
and go to sleep.

1198 
That's what they do up there,
the old ones.

1199 
Just walk out into the lights.

1200 
It's what's expected.
You're a wonderful skater, Duncan.

1201 
You're a wonderful skater.

1202 
Tell Santa Claus what you want, David.

1203 
His house is there,
underneath the lights.
You tell the lights.

1204 
Your dad, he loved the lights.

1205 
Just to sit and watch.
The lights take the cold away.

1206 
Cold.

1207 
Like Chris[mas].

1208 
coming off ice.

1209 
I can walk out onto the ice.

1210 
Tell Santa Claus what you want, David.

1211 
His house is there,

1212 
underneath the lights.
You tell the lights.

1213 
Tell him out loud.

1214 
What you want.

1215 
You want a sled.

1216 
Duncan.

1217 
Oh Christ.

1218 
Duncan.  Oh.

1219 
Move the chair there, against the wall.

1220 
Back it up against the wall.
I don't want to make a mess.

1221 
Christ, kiddo, don't cry.

1222 
This is the best gift you could have

1223 
given me.

1224 
I love you Duncan. I love you.

1225 
Take off my sock, will you?

1226 
Take off my sock, that's how they do it.

1227 
With the toe.

1228 
Oh Christ.

1229 
Thank you.

1230 
Oh thank you.

1231 
Look my goddamn hands are shakin' too much.
I can't hold the gun.

1232 
Hold it for me will ya?

1233 
Oh.  I love you, kid.

1234 
Move it away, move it away a little.
I've got to get my leg up.

1235 
That's a boy, that's a good boy.

1236 
Okay, good boy.  Now when I get my

1237 
toe set,

1238 
you give the gun back to me,

1239 
get the hell outta here.

1240 
You tell Ruth...

1241 
No!
[Shotgun goes off]

1242 
Jesus Christ.
I can't do this for you, grampa.

1243 
Duncan, it was my shell.

1244 
[Bring it back.]

1245 
Oh.

1246 
Oh.

1247 
[Heart attack]

1248 
[Door opens]

1249 
Ronald, I'm home.

1250 
[Door shuts]

1251 
Ronald?

1252 
Oh... [panic]

1253 
Ronald?

1254 
Ron?

1255 
Oh, it's alright.

1256 
It's alright.

1257 
It's alright.

1258 
It's alright, Ronald.

1259 
Grandma?  Hey, grandma! Grampa!
He's gone, Duncan.

1260 
Duncan.

1261 
It's alright.

1262 
It's okay.

1263 
He's gone now.

1264 
Oh.  God.

1265 
[Knocks on door]

1266 
Kate?

1267 
[Knocks on door again]

1268 
Kate!

1269 
[Knocks on door again]

1270 
Kate.

1271 

1272 
Let us give a moment of silence.

1273 
Amen.

1274 
Hey Kate?
Can you help with the car, please?
Okay.

1275 
Did you know I come up here?

1276 
When I'm ever, um,

1277 
out fishing at a cabin or whatever.

1278 
Oh yeah, four, five times a year.

1279 
Nah, I never knew that.

1280 
Oh yeah, yeah.
Sort of a motivational thing for me.

1281 
Everything I've ever done
I've done to make him proud.

1282 
Make this

1283 
block of granite proud.

1284 
School. The job.

1285 
Cara and the girls.  All for him.

1286 
Lately, I don't think he'd be so proud.

1287 
So I needed to see this, you know?

1288 
Remind myself that...

1289 
And you, you fuckin' idiot,
you need to remind yourself of this.

1290 
It was a long time ago, Duncan.

1291 
Quit

1292 
wasting your shit, you know.
Do something. Make him proud.

1293 
Make 'em both proud.

1294 

1295 
He'd have been proud of you, Jake.
Yeah.

1296 
ah

1297 
Oh yeah, I uh,
I need a place to stay for a few months.

1298 
Oh.

1299 
Hey.  Come here, man.

1300 
[Exits door]
[Proprieter: Thank you.]

1301 
Okay, so here's my address where
I'm going to be for the next 
twelve months.

1302 
And I expect you to write.

1303 
Or you could just

1304 
stop by one day.

1305 
Maybe I'll do that.

1306 
You know, when your nipples thaw.

1307 
Laughs.

1308 
I got this for you.

1309 
So you can start your collection.

1310 
You're gonna make me cry.

1311 
I don't know which one is me.  [Laughs]

1312 
That's you right there.

1313 
That looks like Finn.
No, that's Finn.

1314 
That's you.

1315 

1316 
[Horn honks]

1317 
Okay.

1318 
Duncan, I know you think I just

1319 
breeze through these towns
and I never get hurt, but ...

1320 
It really hurts to leave you here.

1321 
And this is just a place, you know.

1322 
[Horn honks again]

1323 
Asshole!

1324 
Please don't let that be the
 last word I ever hear you say.

1325 
[Horn honks again]

1326 
Prick!

1327 
Much better.

1328 
Okay.

1329 
Kate!
[Westerberg getting gas,
giving an autograph]

1330 
It's all yours, Stu.

1331 
Right.

1332 
Put in a little extra for you, you know?

1333 
In case you need some help.

1334 
Thanks, Stu.

1335 
Anything to help, peckerwood.

1336 
You know that.

1337 
Hey Stu?
Yeah?

1338 
The night that my dad died.

1339 
Was he doing cocaine?

1340 
Is that what killed him?

1341 
No.

1342 
Not at all.

1343 
I need to know that that's the truth.

1344 
Please.

1345 
Yeah.

1346 
I tried to get him to do a few lines but um,

1347 
that night

1348 
he was scared man.

1349 
He was so much fun when he got high, but...

1350 
I dunno.

1351 
He didn't want to do anything,
you know, he was afraid

1352 
he thought that

1353 
if he did something
he'd leave you and your brother

1354 
behind and

1355 
that would be not so good, you know.

1356 
So,

1357 
you two were the only thing
in his life you know that.

1358 
We all flipped him shit, and uh,

1359 
it got real heated.

1360 
Then uh,

1361 
we got all worked up and stormed out.

1362 
I found him face down on the driveway.

1363 
My best friend

1364 
and I

1365 
I called.

1366 
Okay.

1367 
That was a long time ago.

1368 
[Traveling music]

1369 
So, turns out they got a pretty good
engineering school here in San Diego.

1370 
I can't believe.
