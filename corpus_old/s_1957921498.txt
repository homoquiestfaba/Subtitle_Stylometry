I already told you.

I don't speak Spanish.

If I could just call my embassy.

You had the wrong guy.

I'm just a tourist.

Would you stop hitting me?

Doesn't anyone
here speak English?

Yes, we do speak
English, Mr. Smith.

But I know that
you speak Spanish.

And I know that you
are an assassin.

The only thing I don't
know is who's paying you

and who sent you.

But believe me, you
are going to tell me.

He was like my brother.

You're making a mistake.

The killing has
never been the hard part...

It's the repeating.

Find... Kill... Repeat.

Smith.

Howard, you are late.

Do you have it?

Then plug it in.

And don't unplug it until you
have seen it all completed.

20%...

30%...

40%...

60%...

70%...

80%...

Upload complete.

Keepin' the doctor away?

Pardon?

With the apples. Isn't
that how the saying goes?

There's fourteen ways to
kill a man with an apple.

Seventeen if the
stem is still in.

Just kidding.

You are so funny.

Do you need a bag,
sweetie, or anything else?

No, thank you.

Hey, Mikey.

Hey, thanks, man.

Hey, Howard. Your usual?
Hi.

Coffee black?
No, nothing today.

Okay.

So?

He's, um, over there
sitting at the booth.

Howard, you're doing okay?

Yeah, I'm good.

Are you sure?
I'm good.

He's been here over an hour.

I'm here if you need anything.

Yeah.

Pete?

Sure.

Looks like you got yourself
in a bad spot, old man.

Do you have them?

What?

Money. Passport. Tickets.

I do have.

What does that
mean? Where are they?

Nearby. I have to
check the codes first.

That wasn't the deal, okay?

I said you get nothing until
I see passport and money.

The decryption codes, Howard.

Look, I got people chasing me.

I gotta get out of town.

I don't have time for this,
okay? I'm out of here.

Do yourself a favor,
Howard. Be smart.

Is everything okay, sir?

Sound is apparent enough.

Hey, it's a nice day outside.

We should go for a walk
and talk about this.

Let's go.

Sorry, gents, but
I can't let you leave

until I've had a few
words with this fella.

Motherfucker.

You, get up.

Your name is Howard, right?

Quality.

Let me guess.

Rich mommy and daddy.
Ivy League education.

Pretty little wife.
Couple of kids at home.

Now why the fuck would
you keep that out.

You know my problem is, Howard?

I've been a contractor
for a very long time.

Much of it for good man
who takes good care of me.

The same man that
gave you a job.

I've been looking after you.

We'll get on of it now, huh?

Thailand stands still, right?

So we've got to
think of the future.

The governor, he'd
like to retire.

The company, it has
been liquidated.

So where does that
leave us, right?

Uncertain times indeed.

Now I don't know about
you, mate, but I got plans.

20-five years of
doing this shite.

It's done my fucking head in.

Now, I want to live
in a house on a beach.

Somewhere in Asia.

I can fish off my boat.

And not be looking
over my shoulder for
the rest of my life.

I think I deserve it.

And the boss, he deserves it too

because he's a diamond geezer.

So if I hear that
you've interfered

with the sale of his company-
I didn't do it. I swear.

I swear.

The code, Howie.

Where are they?

And where's Rousseau?

I told you I don't
have the codes.

I don't know. I don't know.

But you know where
Rousseau is, right?

No, I don't.

You know, problem
for you, Howie,

is I'm starting to believe you.

And that ain't
good for you, sir.

Okay, okay. Okay. Okay.

Wise decision.

Good morning, Gov.

I just had a little chat
with Howard. He had MIT.

No. No, no, no, no.

Really?

I'd long gone by now.

How'd you find him?

I don't need to know.

What'd you find out?

He doesn't have
the decryption codes.

He already sold them Rousseau.

But now, they've
been re-encrypted.

Are you sure?
Positive.

And?

The emails, the information,
it's already been leaked.

It's all over the internet.

Fortunately, no one will
be able to make sense

of 'em until it's decrypted.

If that information is
made public, it's all over.

A deal we're dealing
with will be the dead.

And the other things, things
we've had to do to survive.

It's all in there.

A lifetime of work...

Gone in an instant.

I think I know where he is.

Where?

Tijuana, Mexico.
By the border.

What's he doing there?

I guess as he plans to
cross into the states,

we've got to get to him first.

Do whatever it takes.

No worries.
Considered it sorted.

Sorry about your wife, John.

It's okay.

For ex-fil, just in case.

Thanks. I got it.
Thanks.

He'll get you where you're
going? No questions.

It's all below deck.

Long range, short range,
anti-surveillance,

and one-time pad.

And a cold one in the fridge.

Take care of yourself, John.

Reminds me of Madrid.

Nice tables. Pigeons.

Coffee tastes like shit though.

Are we good?
Not really.

What does that mean?

Means you made a mess
of things down in Bolivia.

Three dead cops.

Chief of Police,
for Christ's sake.

I had no choice.
They had to die.

Really?

Well, I'm gonna have
to take an extra 10%

just to fix things.

Oh, gracia.

What's next?

You do understand that
you're a difficult asset

to sell right now, huh?

Subtlety is no longer
your strong suit.

Wanna tell me what's
going on, John?

I'm the best solo asset
you've got and you know it.

I can't book what
people don't want.

Our clients pay...

They pay for discretion, John.

When they hire somebody
to clean up a mess

or mitigate a risk, they
don't want some fucking cowboy

to go in there and
turning simple John

into a goddamn bloodbath.

Gonna cut yourself
some slack, huh?

You've been through a lot.

Take a break, maybe.

There's not a lot
going on anyway.

There's always something

What do you got?

Got an open contract.
The border. Tijuana.

Open contracts
are for amateurs.

Either they hire
me or they don't.

It's all I got, brother.

It's your call.

If you want the
gig, you can pick up

the job description at HR.

See you around.

â™ª I saw you walkin'
in my dreams â™ª

â™ª With night diamonds â™ª

â™ª I saw a glimmer to the trees â™ª

â™ª With night diamonds â™ª

â™ª I thought you're
coming, baby in my mind â™ª

â™ª I heard you whisper
to me in real time â™ª

â™ª You want the melon, honey â™ª

â™ª You get to ripe â™ª

â™ª My clock is twice as fast â™ª

â™ª So don't you waste my time â™ª

â™ª You know that â™ª

â™ª The sun is coming up
but I wanna go down â™ª

Are you Javier?

Javier quit.

Too bad.

Did he leave something for me?

Oye. Javier!

Hey, Javier.

Your target
is a French National,

Jean Rousseau.

Former tech innovator
turned hacker and leaker.

His actions are linked to the
fall of several multinational

corporations, a drug cartel,
and an African dictator.

Credible Intel shows that
he's preparing a data dump

that will expose
fraud and corruption

within a U.S. conglomerate.

Rousseau was last seen with
his private security detail

at the Grand Hotel
in downtown Tijuana.

Auxiliary detachment zero
will steward covert access

at nine hundred hours.

Nearby Barrios may provide
cover to base operations

and avoid in theater
operators hunting

the seven-figure bounty.

Discretion and
expediency are paramount.

Seek. Locate. Terminate
with prejudice.

It's 20 for me and
five for the room.

How much for the whole night?

A hundred dollars.

80, it's okay for me.

I'll pay you 200 if
you stay in the room

for the whole night.

Half now...

Half later?

Okay. But nothing rough.

And cameras are extra.

Nothing at all.
Take the night off.

Where did you go?
Who did you talk to?

No one. I spoke to no one.

I swear, please.

I went to my sister's house.

She--she lives upstairs.

I thought you might be hungry.

Have you eaten?

Thank you.

Are you here to kill someone?

Is that what the gun is for?

It's what I do.

I'm good at it.

It's all I'm good at.

What you do is
not who you are.

I'll take your bag, sir.

This will be your room, sir.

Here's your room key.

Where the hell is Miguel?

He couldn't make
it. Edgar sent me.

Code in. Code in!

Necktie.

No, no, no. I'm
sorry, sorry, sorry.

It's bow tie. Bow tie.

I don't work with
people I don't know.

I'm all he could get
on such short notice.

How long you're going to need?

Two days. Maybe three.

You can keep the
staff out here, right?

Yeah, sure.

I'm going to need some
eyes and a little help

from guest services,

if you're up for it.

Yes, whatever you
need. I got you.

All right. Here's the
guy we have to find.

Heavy French accent.

Probably checked in
within the last few days.

Sykes.

What are you doing?

Talk to me, Chico.

I found your
guy. I got his room number.

It looks like he has
a security detail.

Yeah, I know her.
Really? No shit.

It's Sykes. She's
usually working at an angle.

All right, so
how do you want to proceed?

We're going to need to
separate her from the target.

Come on. Let's get ready.

Okay, Chico, you ready for this?

In and out, right?

In and out. Don't linger.

I know these operators.
They will make you.

Hey, did you ever
sleep with her?

Which one?

Either?

We're just colleagues.

Right.

Are you carrying?

Leave this to me, okay?

You're safer without it.

Come on.

Let's get going here.
We're burning daylight.

Now remember, Chico, in and out.

In and out. Right.

Room service.

Room service?

Hold on.

Over there. Spread arm. Up, up.

You're good.

Thank you.

Good morning, sir.

You have your breakfast here.

Some orange juice.

And some decoration
for the table.

Wow, a dollar.

Thank you. You'll do now.

Will you been
needing anything else?

No, this is...it.

This is fine.

Wow.

You really do have a great
view from this suite.

In and out.

Yes, we do.

You know, there's a lot
of things you do in Tijuana.

If you have the time.

Will you be staying long?

No. Just for business.

Well that's a shame.
You can go shopping.

There's restaurants, music, art.

Get out of there, Chico.

I'm very serious, sir.

I mean we have great
clothing stores,

great shoe stores,
great computer stores.

We even have a great time--

Hm?

What the hell is this?

What did you say?

Get out of there.

I just said there's
great stores in Tijuana.

No, no, no. He
said computer stores.

Why?

Why?

Look at me. Why?

Whoa!

Smith.

Yeah.

Go to the door!

Thanks, Chico.

Nice to see you again, John.

You look good, Sykes,
but you're slowing down.

Jesus Christ,
you know this guy?

Yes.

He's an ex-boyfriend?
A colleague.

Come on, Sykes.

Here!

Go!

Oh. Don't... don't touch me.

Who the fuck are you?!

I need to have
a word with you.

Where's Smith?

Oy.

Oy.

Where's Smith?

I--I don't know.

Is that right?

How'd you know him?

A guy paid me 3000
bucks to help him out.

Who was the guy?

Edgar...Edgar some--something.
I don't remember.

Edgar Mann.

This yours?
Yeah.

Unlock it.

So...so you know him, right?

Yeah. We've met. So
how did he contact you?

Baysanos Bar.

He has people that work there.

So you guys are cool, right?

Right, you guys are cool?

You guys are friends?

Actually, no.

Are you going to kill me?

I...I can pay you.

I--I--I have money.

Please, please, please.

I beg. I beg.

Please, please don't shoot
me. I can pay. Please.

Get down.

Please.
Get down!

Please.

Are you married?

Are you married?!

She's dead.

And the lady, break failure.

The car company said
it was 'driver error.'

Bullshit. Manufacturing defect.

I hacked into the
file to prove it.

That is what they do, you see.

They make as much
money as possible.

And fuck you if
you're in the way.

There is no accountability.

The government,
they are pussies.

It is why I do.

I fill the void when
they are murderers.

I hold up the mirror.

It was three
years ago when they died.

Maybe... it is over.

Maybe now it is finished.

Get in the car.

What's this all about anyways?

Silver.

He behaves like a
king but he's a thug.

He has built an empire
but with mob connections

and insider trading,
anything crooked.

But he's stupid and greedy.

Now, all his holdings are
only worth something on paper.

Yeah.

And he plans on selling it
all to the highest bidder.

Exact demo.

He did is toxic.

So I use some leverage
on one of his guys inside

using some of
Silver's own money.

And I've got some data that
explains exactly how much

in the red he actually is.

I encrypted it and I
hid it on the internet.

Now he wants his data back.

And you can decrypt this data?

Oh, yeah. Not a problem.

How?

Using codes in my head.

So how much
are you paying Sykes?

100 grand.

You've got a million-dollar
purse on your head.

How long do you
think she was going

to pretend to protect you?

Okay. What is your plan?

Get to the border.

I'll get you to the U.S.
Marshals in San Diego.

They can protect you.

Thank you for not shooting me

but I don't want
to be prosecuted.

You got a much better chance
of making your case in court

than you do out here.

Do you have any idea how
many hitmen are after you?

He has a meathead
to kills for him.

Yeah, like gloves.
Funny accent.

So Henrik Botha from
London. You know him?

I used to.

Jesus Christ, you guys
you all know each other.

Oh, really? Where
am I going to go, huh?

Just look natural.
I'll be back.

Natural how? I'll have a soda.

Agh.

How much?

It's two. Two dollars.

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

Aaahhh!

Ah! Jesus Christ! You
could have killed me!

Get in the car.

Does this car have a GPS?

What?

Did Sykes put a GPS
tracker in the car?

I don't know. It is possible.

Son of a bitch.

Stay low.

Okay. Time to go.

What?

Come on.

Who the hell is John Smith?

He's just another
shooter for hire.

You know him?

Once upon a time, yeah.

Maybe this
wasn't such a good idea.

There's too many operators.
Too many variables.

I'm on top of it, governor.

Has the security
detail contacted us yet?

She will.

She wants to get paid, so
she'll make the exchange.

Fine. Set it
up. Get the codes.

It's so fragile.

All of this money...

Life...

So very fragile.

If you get me out of this, I'll
make you a rich man, Henrik.

Richer than you ever dreamed.

Kill everyone.

I need this to go away.
All of it. Please.

I'll take care
all of it, boss.

You get some sleep.

Hola?

I lost him.

Lost him? I thought
you were gonna kill him.

Yeah.

About that, we're taking
the Marshall's bounty.

That's a
fraction as much?!

We're taking it.

I told you to 'be subtle.'

Not 'go soft.'

But look, I'm glad you called.

There's been a wrinkle.

It seems that Rousseau has
held on to some of the codes

to decrypt the data that
he stole from Silver.

And now Silver wants it back.

So I've heard.

Sykes must be holding
Rousseau for a ransom.

That's why she didn't just
put a bullet in his head

when she had the chance.
Yeah.

And I don't think he's
gonna be willing to pay her.

He may think we have
the codes at this point.

Are you safe?

Am I safe?

I'm an enigma.

I'm a mystery.

I'm the fucking needle
in the haystack, baby.

Nobody can find me.

Yeah. Yeah.
How do I find Rousseau?

I don't think that's
gonna be too hard.

I've been looking
at his website.

I think he took him to the
De La Rosa development.

It's private.

It's one of those developments.

It isn't finished.

Never gonna be finished.

But he's got a
million-dollar view.

It's a great place to hide
out and issue ransom demands.

I think he posted something
with his smartphone trying

to send us a message.

But look, there's something
more you should know.

Where are you right now?

At the Dead Drop.

All right, John, listen to me.

Listen to me very carefully.

I want you to get up and I want
you to get out of that bar.

Do you understand me?

Silver has widened the
contract to anybody associated

with this job.

He's burning the whole project.

He's gonna fill your
lap with locals.

He's sending in an enforcer
after Sykes and Rousseau.

Smith? Smith?!

I gotta go.

You ain't going nowhere.

Fuck!

Esperanza.

What happened?

I had a disagreement.

Let me help you.

I'm sorry.

This has to come out.

I'll get some things.

I'll be right back.

One left. Are you ready?

Don't tell me. Just do it.

You're gonna be okay.

Yeah. I think I'm
going to be fine.

Ugh.

Sorry about your sheets.

They've seen worse.

I was married once too.

What happened?

You know what they say.

Don't go into
business with family.

Maybe not so good idea to fall
in love and marry your pimp.

It didn't last, anyway.

What happened to your wife?

Not much to tell.

She's in a better place.

I'm sorry.

Is
everything okay?

I gotta go.

Right now?

Yeah.

Okay, I'll make some coffee.

What's wrong?

We gotta go.

What?
Now!

Ahh!

Go! Go!

Yeah?

An open contract? Are
you fucking kidding me?

What can I say?
The economy is slow.

You bring me Rousseau,
I'll let you live.

Mm, I can't do that.
Sure you can.

You stick him in a
booty of your motor

and you bring him to
me now. Easy peasy.

I got my bounty.

What? The Marshall's?

Yeah, I mean
a lot of fun. Yeah?

Look, because you went
soft doesn't mean you have

to go stupid.

What the fuck happened to you?

I knew you when you were young.

In your prime, I treated
you like a little brother.

See you around, Henrik.

Do you like the coast?
Yeah.

They're in there?

Yeah.

Esperanza, listen.

I want you to take the car.

Get out of here. Keep driving.

Just head south until
all this blows over.

I don't want to leave.

Please.

Let me stay.

Look, I'm not likely
to make this happen.

And even if I do, I'm
gonna have to run.

You're safer gone.

Take care of yourself.

You know, he's not
going to pay you.

He does not have any money.

He is going to have you killed.

I can pay you.

I have money.

You take me to the U.S. Marshal.

Oh, come on.

How many people do you
think are going to come?

Come to kill you.

Not just professionals
like Smith and Botha,

but local contractors.

20, maybe 30.

How many people do you think
you can take on your own?

Six? Eight? A dozen,
you crazy lesbian.

Would you shut up?!

Get up! Take the stairs.

Sykes, Silver's burned us.

We gotta get out of here.

This way.

Sykes!

Get in.

Sykes, it's time to ex-fil.

Not until I get my money.

He's never going to pay you.

He will if he
wants his data back!

I'll get him out of here
and you can just disappear.

You've lost it.

You're soft.

Just go.

Lucky you.

Botha.

I know you're out there, Botha.

And I'm ready for you.

Mr. Smith.

Mr. Smith. Is that you?

Is that all you got, John?

You're gonna have to do better
than that if you're gonna

take up the king of this jungle.

You're in the endgame, mate.

I came here for him.

But if you get in my way, I'm
gonna have you for lunch, son.

You wanna fight or
you're gonna dance around

like a fucking
ballerina all night?

You fucked up, John.

You sided with a mock
and you broke the code

when you made that decision
to you would end up like this.

You and me, you're either very
brave or very fucking stupid.

I'm gonna make this
quick for old time sake.

I guess it's a good
thing for you it's me

rather than some
cheaper stranger.

Don't you ever
get tired of it?

Botha!

Now we're even.

See you around, John.

See you around, Sykes.

You came back.

I never left.

Rousseau, Esperanza.

Hey.

What do you think will happen?

They'll take you into custody.

Probably book you, hold
you till the morning,

and the Marshals
will take you away.

Hey, it's your chance
to make your case.

It's your day in court.

Idiot.

Well, you are right.

And, uh, what will you do?

Head South?

Yes.

Disappear for a while.

Start over.

Well, um...

Good luck.

Mademoiselle.

Take care of yourself.

Officer!

â™ª Take me down â™ª

â™ª Leave the night behind â™ª

â™ª Push it away â™ª

â™ª Out in the dark you'll find â™ª

â™ª You're not afraid â™ª
