One last round gentlemen

Everybody!

BURR:
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?

AARON BURR:
How does a bastard, orphan,
son of a whore and a Scotsman

Dropped in the middle of a
forgotten spot in the Caribbean

By providence, impoverished, in squalor
grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

JOHN LAURENS:
The ten-dollar Founding Father
without a father

Got a lot farther
by workin' a lot harder

By bein' a lot smarter
by bein' a self-starter

By fourteen, they placed him
in charge of a trading charter

THOMAS JEFFERSON:
And every day while slaves were
being slaughtered and carted away

Across the waves, he struggled
and kept his guard up

Inside, he was longing for
something to be a part of

The brother was ready to
beg, steal, borrow, or barter

JAMES MADISON:
Then a hurricane came
and devastation reigned

Our man saw his future drip,
drippin' down the drain

Put a pencil to his temple,
connected it to his brain

And he wrote his first refrain
a testament to his pain

BURR:
Well the word got around,
they said, "This kid is insane, man!"

Took up a collection just to
send him to the mainland

"Get your education, don't forget
from whence you came,

and the world's gonna know your name!
What's your name, man?"

ALEXANDER HAMILTON:
Alexander Hamilton

My name is Alexander Hamilton

And there's a million
things I haven't done
My name is Alexander Hamilton

And there's a million
things I haven't done

But just you wait,
just you wait

ELIZA SCHUYLAR:
When he was ten, his father split,
full of it, debt-ridden

Two years later, see Alex
and his mother, bed-ridden

Half-dead, sittin' in their own sick
The scent thick

And Alex got better
but his mother went quick

GEORGE WASHINGTON:
Moved in with a cousin,
the cousin committed suicide

Left him with nothin' but ruined pride,
somethin' new inside

A voice saying
"Alex you gotta fend for yourself"

He started retreatin' and readin'
every treatise on the shelf

BURR:
There would've been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute

He would've been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution

Started workin', clerkin'
for his late mother's landlord

Tradin' sugar cane and rum
and other things he can't afford

(Scammin') for every book
he can get his hands on

(Plannin') for the future, see him now
as he stands on (oooh)

The bow of a ship headed
for a new land

In New York you can be a new man

In New York you can be a new man
HAMILTON: Just you wait

In New York you can be a new man

In New York!
New York!

HAMILTON:
Just you wait!

Alexander Hamilton
(Alexander Hamilton)

We are waiting in the wings for you
(waiting in the wings for you)

You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton
(Alexander Hamilton)

When America sings for you

Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?

The world will never be the same, oh

BURR:
The ship is in the harbor now,
see if you can spot him

Another immigrant
comin' up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep,
America forgot him

MULLIGAN/MADISON & LAFAYETTE/JEFFERSON:
We fought with him!

LAURENS:
Me? I died for him!

WASHINGTON:
Me? I trusted him!

SCHUYLAR SISTERS:
Me? I loved him

BURR:
And me?
I'm the damn fool that shot him!

There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait

BURR:
What's your name, man?

Alexander Hamilton!


New York City

HAMILTON:
Pardon me, are you Aaron Burr, sir?

BURR:
That depends, who's asking?

HAMILTON:
Oh well sure, sir

I'm Alexander Hamilton
I'm at your service, sir

I have been looking for you

BURR:
I'm getting nervous

HAMILTON:
Sir, I heard your name at Princeton

I was seeking an accelerated course of study

When I got sort out of sorts
with a buddy of yours

I may have punched him
It's a blur, sir

He handles the financials--

BURR:
You punched the bursar?

HAMILTON:
Yes, I wanted to do what you did

Graduate in two,
then join the revolution

He looked at me like I was stupid
I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it?
How'd you graduate so fast?

BURR:
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

HAMILTON:
You're an orphan! Of course!

I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!

Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for

BURR:
Can I buy you a drink?

HAMILTON:
That would be nice

BURR:
While we're talking,
let me offer you some free advice

Talk less

HAMILTON:
What?

BURR:
Smile more

HAMILTON:
Ha

BURR:
Don't let them know what you're against
or what you're for

HAMILTON:
You can't be serious

BURR:
You want to get ahead?

HAMILTON:
Yes

BURR:
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

LAURENS:
Yo yo yo yo yo! What time is it?

LAURENS, MULLIGAN:
Showtime!

BURR:
...like I said...

LAURENS:
Showtime! Showtime! Yo!

I'm John Laurens in the place to be!

Uh, two pints o' Sam Adams,
but I'm working on three, uh!

Those redcoats don't want it with me

Cause I will pop chick-a-pop
these cops 'til I'm free!

LAFAYETTE:
Ah oui oui, mon ami,
je m'appelle Lafayette!

The Lancelot
of the revolutionary set!

I came from afar
just to say "Bonsoir!"

Tell the king, "Casse-toi!"
Who's the best? C'est moi!

MULLIGAN:
Brrrah, brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan

Up in it, lovin' it
Yes I heard your mother say "come again?"

Lock up your daughters and horses

Of course it's hard to have intercourse
over four sets of corsets

LAURENS:
No more sex

Pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more

LAURENS, LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN:
To the revolution!

LAURENS:
Well if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton College

MULLIGAN:
Aaron Burr

LAURENS:
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge

BURR:
Good luck with that
You're takin' a stand

You spit, I'mma sit
We'll see where we land

LAURENS:
Burr, the revolution's imminent
What do you stall for?

HAMILTON:
If you stand for nothing, Burr,
what'll you fall for?

LAURENS, MULLIGAN, LAFAYETTE:
Oooh

LAURENS:
Who are you?

MULLIGAN:
Who are you?

LAFAYETTE:
Who are you?

Who, who is this kid?
What's he gonna do?

HAMILTON:
I am not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot

Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

And I'm not throwing away my shot!

I'mma get scholarship to King's College

I probably shouldn't brag,
but dag, I amaze and astonish

The problem is I got a lot of brains,
but no polish

I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word I drop knowledge

I'm a diamond in the rough,
a shiny piece of coal

Tryin' to reach my goal,
my power of speech: unimpeachable

Only nineteen,
but my mind is older

These New York City streets
getting colder, I shoulder

Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage

I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished

The plan is to fan this spark into a flame

But damn, it's getting dark,
so let me spell out my name

I am the--
A-L, E-X, A-N, D

E-R--we are--meant to be

HAMILTON:
A colony that runs independently

Meanwhile, Britain keeps
shitting on us endlessly

Essentially, they tax us relentlessly

Then King George turns around,
runs a spending spree

He ain't never gonna set
his descendants free

So there will be a revolution
in this century

Enter Me!

LAURENS, LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN:
(He says in parentheses)

HAMILTON:
Don't be shocked when your
history book mentions me

I will lay down my life
if it sets us free

Eventually you'll see my ascendancy

And I am not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot

Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

HAMILTON & LAURENS:
And I'm not throwing away my shot

HAMILTON, MULLIGAN, LAURENS, LAFAYETTE:
I am not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot

Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

LAFAYETTE:
I dream of life without the monarchy

The unrest in France will lead to "onarchy"

"Onarchy?" How you say,
how you s--Oh, anarchy!

When I fight I make the other side panicky

With my
Shot!

MULLIGAN:
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice

And I got y'all knuckleheads
in loco parentis

I'm joining the rebellion
cuz I know it's my chance

To socially advance,
instead of sewin' some pants

I'm gonna take a
Shot!

LAURENS:
Eh, but we'll never be truly free

Until those in bondage
have the same rights as you and me

You and I, do or die,
wait till I sally in on a stallion

With the first black battalion

Have another
Shot!

BURR:
Geniuses, lower your voices

You keep out of trouble,
and you double your choices

I'm with you,
but the situation is fraught

You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

HAMILTON:
Burr, check what we got

Mr. Lafayette hard rock like Lancelot

I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot

Let's hatch a plot blacker
than the kettle callin' the pot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot

Let's hatch a plot blacker
than the kettle callin' the pot

What are the odds the gods
would put us all in one spot

Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom,
like it or not

A bunch of revolutionary
manumission abolitionists

Give me a position,
show me where the ammunition is

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?

Sometimes I get over excited,
shoot off at the mouth

I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

LAURENS:
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd!

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot

Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot

Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

And I'm not throwing away my shot

LAURENS and (HAMILTON, LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN):
Everybody sing

Woah-woah, wo-oh-oh
(Woah-woah, wo-oh-oh)

Hey
Wo-oh-oh (Wo-oh-oh)

Wooh!!
Wo-oh-oh (Wo-oh-oh)

Sing let 'em hear ya (Yeah)

Let's go!
(Woah-woah, wo-oh-oh)

I said, shout it to the rooftops
(Wo-oh-oh)

Said to the rooftops
(Wo-oh-oh)

Now come on

Now come on, let's go

Rise up

When you're living on your knees,
you rise up

Tell your brother that
he's got to rise up

Tell your sister that
she's got to rise up

When are these colonies gonna rise up

When are these colonies gonna rise up
Rise up!

HAMILTON:
I imagine death so much
it feels more like a memory

When's it's gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?

If I see it coming,
do I run or do I let it be?

Is it like a beat without a melody?

See, I never thought I'd live
past twenty

Where I come from
some get half as many

Ask anybody why we livin'
fast and we laugh, reach for a flask

We have to make this moment last,
that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement

Where all the hungriest brothers
with something to prove went

Foes oppose us,
we take an honest stand

We roll like Moses,
claimin' our Promised Land

And? If we win our independence?

Is that a guarantee of
freedom for our descendants?

Or will the blood we shed
begin an endless

Cycle of vengeance and death
with no defendants?

I know the action in the street is excitin'

But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n fightin'
I've been readin' 'n writin'

We need to handle our financial situation

Are we a nation of states?
What's the state of our nation?

I'm past patiently waitin'!
I'm passionately smashin' every expectation

Every action's an act of creation

I'm laughin' in the face of
casualties and sorrow

For the first time,
I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

And I am not throwin' away my shot
I am not throwin' away my shot

Hey, yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

And I'm not throwin' away my shot

We gonna rise up
time to take a shot
(Not thrown' away my shot)

We gonna rise up;
time to take a shot
(Not throwin' away my shot)

We gonna (rise up, rise up)
It's time to take a shot

(Rise up, rise up)
It's time to take a shot

(Rise up, rise up)
(Wo-oah) Time to take a shot (rise up)

Take a shot, a shot, a shot,
(Oh-Oh, oh)

A-yo, it's time to take a shot
(Woah, oh-oh oh)

Time to take a shot
(Woah-oh)

And I am (And I am)
Not throwing away my

Not throwing away my shot!

HAMILTON:
I may not live to see our glory

LAURENS, MULLIGAN, & LAFAYETTE:
I may not live to see our glory

HAMILTON:
But I will gladly join the fight

LAURENS, MULLIGAN, & LAFAYETTE:
But I will gladly join the fight

HAMILTON:
And when our children tell our story

LAURENS, MULLIGAN, & LAFAYETTE:
And when our children tell our story

HAMILTON:
They'll tell the story of tonight

MULLIGAN:
Let's have another round tonight

LAFAYETTE:
Let's have another round tonight

HAMILTON:
Let's have another round tonight

LAURENS:
Raise a glass to freedom

Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you

Raise a glass to the four of us

LAURENS and MULLIGAN:
Tomorrow there'll be more of us

LAURENS, MULLIGAN, & LAFAYETTE:
Telling the story of tonight

HAMILTON:
They'll tell the story of tonight

MULLIGAN, LAURENS, & LAFAYETTE:
Raise a glass to freedom

Something they can never take away

HAMILTON:
No matter what they tell you

MULLIGAN & LAFAYETTE:
Let's have another round tonight

LAURENS:
Raise a glass to the four of us

MULLIGAN, LAURENS, & LAFAYETTE:
Tomorrow there'll be more of us

HAMILTON & LAURENS:
Telling the story of tonight

MULLIGAN & LAFAYETTE:
Let's have another round tonight

HAMILTON, LAURENS:
They'll tell the story of tonight

LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN:
Raise a glass to freedom

HAMILTON, LAURENS:
They'll tell the story of tonight

LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN:
Raise a glass to freedom

HAMILTON, LAURENS:
They'll tell the story of tonight

LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN:
They'll tell the story of

Tonight

BURR:
There's nothing rich folks love more

Than going downtown
and slumming it with the poor

They pull up in their carriages and gawk

At the students in the common
Just to watch 'em talk

Take Philip Schuyler, the man is loaded
Uh oh, but little does he know

That his daughters,
Peggy, Angelica, Eliza

Sneak into the city
just to watch all the guys at

(Work, work)
ANGELICA:
Angelica!

(Work, work)
ELIZA:
Eliza!

PEGGY:
And Peggy!
(Work, work)

The Schuyler sisters!

ANGELICA:
Angelica!

PEGGY:
Peggy!

ELIZA:
Eliza!
(Work!)

PEGGY:
Daddy said to be home by sundown

ANGELICA:
Daddy doesn't need to know

PEGGY:
Daddy said not to go downtown

ELIZA:
Like I said, you're free to go

ANGELICA:
But--look around, look around

The revolution's happening in New York

ELIZA & PEGGY:
New York

Angelica
Work!

PEGGY:
It's bad enough daddy wants to go to war

ELIZA:
People shouting in the square

PEGGY:
It's bad enough there'll be violence on our shore

ANGELICA:
New ideas in the air

ANGELICA:
Look around, look around--

ELIZA:
Angelica, remind me what we're looking for

ALL MEN:
She's looking for me!

ANGELICA:
Eliza, I'm looking for a mind at work
(work, work)

I'm looking for a mind at work
(work, work)

Woa-oah, woa-oah
Work!

BURR:
Ooh, there's nothing like summer in the city

Someone in a rush
next to someone looking pretty

Excuse me, miss,
I know it's not funny

But your perfume smells
like your daddy's got money

Why you slummin' in the city
in your fancy heels?

You searchin' for an urchin
who can give you ideals?

ANGELICA:
Burr, you disgust me

BURR:
Ahh, so you've discussed me

I'm a trust fund, baby,
you can trust me

ANGELICA:
I've been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine

So men say that I'm intense or I'm insane

You want a revolution?
I want a revelation!

So listen to my declaration:

"We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal"

And when I meet Thomas Jefferson
I'mma compel him to include women in the sequel

Work!

ELIZA:
Look around, look around

At how lucky we are
to be alive right now

ELIZA, PEGGY:
Look around, look around

At how lucky we are
to be alive right now

ANGELICA, ELIZA & PEGGY:
History is happening in Manhattan and we

Just happen to be in the
greatest city in the world

In the greatest city in the world!

Cause I've been reading
Common Sense by Thomas Paine

So men say that
I'm intense or I'm insane

You want a revolution?
I want a revelation!

So listen to my declaration

We hold these truths to be self evident
That all men are created equal

Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now

History is happening in Manhattan
And we just happen to be

In the greatest city in the world
(in the greatest city)

In the greatest city in the world!

ANGELICA:
(Work, work) Angelica!

ELIZA:
(Work, work) Eliza!

PEGGY:
And Peggy! (Work, work)

ALL SISTERS:
The Schuyler sisters! (Work, work)

We're looking for a mind at work
(work, work)

Hey (work, work)
Woah-ah! (work, work)

ELIZA & PEGGY (COMPANY):
Hey (work, work)

In the greatest city

ALL SISTERS:
In the greatest city in the world!

In the greatest city in the world!

SEABURY:
Hear ye, hear ye!

My name is Samuel Seabury,
and I present

"Free thoughts on the proceedings
of the Continental Congress!"

Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interest at heart

MULLIGAN:
Oh my god. Tear this dude apart

SEABURY:
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution

Don't let them lead you astray

This congress does not speak for me

BURR:
Let him be

SEABURY:
They're playing a dangerous game

I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame!

HAMILTON:
Yo!

(Heed not the rabble who)
He'd have you all unravel

(Scream--)
At the sound of screams

(Revolution--)
But the revolution is comin'

(They have not your interests)
The have-nots are gonna win this

(At heart--)
It's hard to listen to you

with a straight face

(Chaos and bloodshed--)
Chaos and bloodshed

(Are not--)
Already haunt us

(A solution--)
Honestly, you shouldn't even talk--

(Don't let them lead you astray--)
And what about Boston?

Look at the cost of all that we've lost
And you talk about Congress?

SEABURY:
This Congress does not speak for me

HAMILTON:
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee

SEABURY:
You're playing a dangerous game

HAMILTON:
But strangely, your mange is the same!

SEABURY:
I pray the king shows you his mercy

HAMILTON:
Is he in Jersey?

SEABURY:
For shame--

HAMILTON:
For the Revolution!

SEABURY:
For shame!

For the Revolution!

SEABURY:
Heed--

If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna
(Scream--)

Honestly, look at me, please don't read!
(Not your interest--)

Don't modulate the key
then not debate with me

Why should a tiny island across the sea
Regulate the price of tea?

BURR:
Alexander, please!

HAMILTON:
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive
Drop the niceties

Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!

A message from the King!

You say the price of my love's
not a price that you're willing to pay

You cry in your tea which you hurl
in the sea when you see me go by

Why so sad? Remember we made
an arrangement when you went away

Now you're making me mad

Remember despite our estrangement,
I'm your man

You'll be back
Soon you'll see

You'll remember you belong to me

You'll be back
Time will tell

You'll remember that I served you well

Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all

And when push comes to shove,

I will send a fully armed battalion
to remind you of my love

You say our love is draining
and you can't go on

You'll be the one complaining
when I am gone

And, no! don't change the subject
'Cause you're my favorite subject

My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject

Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

You'll be back
Like before

I will fight the fight and win the war

For your love
For your praise

And I'll love you till my dying days

When you're gone, I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

'Cause when push comes to shove

I will kill your friends and family
to remind you of my love

British Admiral Howe's
got troops on the water

Thirty-two thousand troops in
New York harbor

When they surround our troops!
They surround our troops!

They surround our troops!

HAMILTON:
As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war

I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to--

Rise up!

HAMILTON:
If they tell my story

I am either gonna die on the
battlefield in glory or--

Rise up!

HAMILTON:
We will fight for this land

But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can--

Rise up!

HAMILTON:
Understand? It's the only way to--

Rise up! Rise up!

HAMILTON:
Here he comes!

Here comes the General!

BURR:
Ladies and gentlemen!

(Here comes the General!)
The moment you've been waiting for!

(Here comes the General!)
The pride of Mount Vernon!

(Here comes the General!)
George Washington!

WASHINGTON:
We are outgunned! (What?)

Outmanned!
(What?)

Outnumbered, outplanned!

We gotta make an all out stand

Ayo, I'm gonna need a
right-hand man.

Check it--
Can I be real a second?

For just a millisecond?

Let down my guard and tell the people
how I feel a second?

Now I'm the model of a
modern major general

The venerated Virginian veteran
whose men are all lining up

To put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives

Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room

The truth is in ya face
when ya hear the British cannons go--

Boom!

Any hope of success is fleeting

How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?

We put a stop to the bleeding
as the British take Brooklyn

Knight takes rook, but look
We are outgunned! (What?)

Outmanned!
(What?)

Outnumbered, outplanned!

We gotta make an all out stand

Ayo, I'm gonna need a
right-hand man

Incoming!

HAMILTON:
They're battering down the Battery check the damages

We gotta stop 'em and rob 'em
of their advantages

Let's take a stand with the stamina
God has granted us

Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons--

Shh-boom!
(Boom!)

WASHINGTON:
Goes the cannon

Watch the blood and the shit spray and--
(Boom!)

Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and--
(Boom!)

There's another ship and--
(Boom!)

We just lost the southern tip and--
(Boom!)

We gotta run to Harlem quick,
we can't afford another slip

Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up my forces

They're skittish as the
British cut the city up

This close to giving up,
facing mad scrutiny

I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:

Are these the men
with which I am to defend America?

We ride at midnight,
Manhattan in the distance

I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance

BURR:
Your excellency, sir!

WASHINGTON:
Who are you?

BURR:
Aaron Burr, Sir?

Permission to state my case?

WASHINGTON
As you were

BURR:
Sir, I was a captain
under General Montgomery

Until he caught a bullet
in the neck in Quebec

And well, in summary

I think that I could be of some assistance

I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

WASHINGTON:
Huh

BURR:
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions

On how to fight instead of fleeing west

WASHINGTON: Yes?
BURR: Well--

HAMILTON:
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

WASHINGTON:
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

HAMILTON:
Yes, sir

HAMILTON & BURR:
We keep meeting

BURR:
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to
seeing your strategy play out

WASHINGTON: Burr?
BURR: Sir?

WASHINGTON:
Close the door on your way out

HAMILTON:
Have I done something wrong, sir?

WASHINGTON:
On the contrary

I called you here because
our odds are beyond scary

Your reputation precedes you,
but I have to laugh

HAMILTON:
Sir?

WASHINGTON:
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

HAMILTON:
Sir!

WASHINGTON:
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown

I know you stole British cannons
when we were still downtown

Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox
wanted to hire you...

HAMILTON:
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

WASHINGTON:
Why're you upset?

HAMILTON:
I'm not--

WASHINGTON:
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger

I was just like you when I was younger

Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

HAMILTON:
Yes

WASHINGTON:
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder.

HAMILTON:
Why are you telling me this?

WASHINGTON:
I'm being honest

I'm working with a third of what
our Congress has promised

We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

HAMILTON:
I am not throwing away my shot!

WASHINGTON:
Son, we are outgunned, outmanned!

HAMILTON:
You need all the help you can get

I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

WASHINGTON:
Outnumbered, outplanned!

HAMILTON:
We'll need some spies on the inside

Some King's men who might
let some things slide

(Boom!) I'll write to Congress
and tell 'em we need supplies

You rally the guys,
master the element of surprise

(Chicka-boom!) I'll rise above my station,
organize your information

'til we rise to the occasion
of our new nation. Sir!

Here comes the General!

HAMILTON:
Rise up! (What?)

Here comes the General!

HAMILTON:
Rise up! (What?)

Here comes the General!

HAMILTON:
Rise up! (What?)

Here comes the General!

WASHINGTON:
And his right hand man!

Boom!

BURR:
How does the bastard, orphan,

Son of a whore go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?

Watch this obnoxious,
arrogant, loudmouth bother

Be seated at the right hand of the father

Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write

Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common?

We're reliable with the
Ladies!

BURR:
There are so many to deflower!

Ladies!

BURR:
Looks! Proximity to power

Ladies!

BURR:
They delighted and distracted him

Martha Washington named her
feral tomcat after him!

HAMILTON:
That's true


BURR:
A winter's ball

And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

HAMILTON:
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

ELIZA:
Ohh, I do I do I do I dooo

Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I dooo!

Boy you got me helpless!

Look into your eyes,
and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

Down for the count,
and I'm drownin' in 'em

ELIZA:
I have never been the type
to try and grab the spotlight

We were at a revel
with some rebels on a hot night

Laughin' at my sister
as she's dazzling the room

Then you walked in
and my heart went "Boom!"

Tryin' to catch your eye
from the side of the ballroom

Everybody's dancin' and
the band's top volume

Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

Grab my sister, and whisper,
"Yo, this one's mine."

My sister made her way
across the room to you

And I got nervous, thinking
"What's she gonna do?"

She grabbed you by the arm,
I'm thinkin' "I'm through"

Then you look back at me
and suddenly I'm helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes
(Look into your eyes)

(And the sky's the limit)
I'm helpless

I know
(Down for the count and I'm drownin in 'em)

(I'm helpless!)
I'm so into you

(Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit)
I am so into you

I'm helpless!
I know I'm

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em.

HAMILTON:
Where are you taking me?

ANGELICA:
I'm about to change your life

HAMILTON:
Then by all means, lead the way

ELIZA:
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

HAMILTON:
Schuyler?

ANGELICA:
My sister

ELIZA:
Thank you for all your service

HAMILTON:
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet,
it will have been worth it

ANGELICA:
I'll leave you to it

ELIZA:
One week later I'm writing a letter nightly

Now my life gets better,
every letter that you write me

Laughin' at my sister,
cuz she wants to form a harem

ANGELICA:
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me,
you would share him

ELIZA:
Ha!

Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'

My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'

I'm dying inside, as you wine and dine

And I'm tryin' not to cry 'cause
there's nothing that your mind can't do

My father makes his way
across the room to you

I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"

But then he shakes your hand
and says "be true"

And you turn back to me,
smiling, and I'm (Helpless)

(Look into your eyes
and the sky's the limit I'm)

Helpless!

(Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em)

That boy

is mine (Look into your eyes
and the sky's the limit)

(I'm helpless!)
Helpless

Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em

HAMILTON:
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name

An acre of land, a troop to command,
a dollop of fame

All I have's my honor,
a tolerance for pain

A couple of college credits
and my top-notch brain

Insane, your family brings out
a different side of me

Peggy confides in me,
Angelica tried to take a bite of me

No stress, my love for you
is never in doubt

We'll get a little place in Harlem
and we'll figure it out

I've been livin' without a family
since I was a child

My father left, my mother died,
I grew up buckwild

But I'll never forget my mother's face,
that was real

And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so--

(Helpless!)
ELIZA: I do I do I do I do!

HAMILTON: Eliza...
(Helpless!)

ELIZA: I do I do I do I do!
HAMILTON: I've never felt so--

ELIZA: Hey, yeah, yeah!

(Down for the count)

I'm down for the count I'm--
(And I'm drownin' in 'em)

HAMILTON: My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it

I look into your eyes,
and the sky's the limit I'm--

(Helpless!
Down for the count and I'm)

drownin' in 'em

In New York, you can be a new man...

ELIZA:
Helpless

LAURENS:
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!

Now everyone give it up for
the maid of honor, Angelica Schuyler!

ANGELICA:
A toast to the groom! (To the groom!)

To the bride!
(To the bride!)

From your sister,

Who is always by your side.
(By your side!)

To your union,
(To the union! To the revolution!)

and the hope that you provide.
(You provide!)

May you always...
(Alwaysâ€“)

be satisfied.
(Rewindâ€“)

I remember that night, I just might
regret that night for the rest of my days.

I remember those soldier boys
tripping over themselves to win our praise.

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
like a dream that you can't quite place,

but Alexander, I'll never forget
the first time I saw your face.

I have never been the same,
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame,

And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name,
set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame,

This is not a game...

HAMILTON:
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied.

ANGELICA:
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself.

HAMILTON:
You're like me. I'm never satisfied.

ANGELICA:
Is that right?

HAMILTON:
I have never been satisfied.

ANGELICA:
My name is Angelica Schuyler.

HAMILTON:
Alexander Hamilton.

ANGELICA:
Where's your fam'ly from?

HAMILTON:
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't
done but just you wait, just you wait...

ANGELICA:
So so so--

So this is what it feels like to match
wits with someone at your level!

What the hell is the catch?
It's the feeling of freedom,

of seein' the light,
it's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite!

You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes,

maybe three minutes,
ev'rything we said in total agreement,

it's a dream and it's a bit of a dance,
a bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance.

He's a bit of a flirt,
but I'm 'a give it a chance.

I asked about his fam'ly,
did you see his answer?

His hands started fidgeting,
he looked askance?

He's penniless, he's flying
by the seat of his pants.

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!

I wanna take him far away from this place,
then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

ELIZA:
Helpless...

ANGELICA:
And I know she is...

ELIZA:
Helpless...

ANGELICA:
And her eyes are just...

ELIZA:
Helpless...

ANGELICA:
And I realize

Three fundamental truths
at the exact same time...

HAMILTON
Where are you taking me?

ANGELICA
I'm about to change your life.

HAMILTON
Then by all means, lead the way.

(Number one!)
ANGELICA: I'm a girl in a world in which
my only job is to marry rich.

My father has no sons so I'm
the one who has to social climb for one,

so I'm the oldest and the wittiest
and the gossip in New York City is insidious,

And Alexander is penniless, Ha!
That doesn't mean I want him any less.

ELIZA:
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you.

HAMILTON: Schuyler?
ANGELICA: My sister!

(Number two!)
ANGELICA:
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister.
HAMILTON: Schuyler?
ANGELICA: My sister!

(Number two!)
ANGELICA:
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister.

That elevates his status,
I'd have to be naÃ¯ve to set that aside,

maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza,
now that's his bride.

Nice going, Angelica, he was right,
You will never be satisfied.

ELIZA:
Thank you for all your service.

HAMILTON:
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet,
it will have been worth it.

ANGELICA
I'll leave you to it.

(Number three!)
ANGELICA:
I know my sister like I know my own mind

you will never find anyone
as trusting or as kind.

If I tell her that I love him she'd
be silently resigned, he'd be mine.

She would say, "I'm fine"
She'd be lying.

But when I fantasize at night
it's Alexander's eyes,

as I romanticize what might have been
if I hadn't sized him up so quickly.

At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
at least I keep his eyes in my life...

To the groom!
(To the groom!)

To the bride!
(To the bride!)

From your sister,

Who is always by your side.
(By your side)

To your union,
(To the union! To the revolution!)

and the hope that you provide.
(You provide!)

May you always
(Alwaysâ€“)

be satisfied.
(be satisfied)

And I know
(be satisfied)

She'll be happy as his bride

And I know

He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

LAURENS:
I may not live to see our glory!

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE:
I may not live to see our glory!

LAURENS
But I've seen wonders great and small.

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE:
I've seen wonders great and small.

LAURENS:
Cuz if the tomcat can get married,

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE:
If Alexander can get married-

LAURENS:
There's hope for our ass, after all!

LAFAYETTE:
Raise a glass to freedom.

LAURENS/MULLIGAN:
Hey! Something you will never see again!

MULLIGAN:
No matter what she tells you.

LAFAYETTE:
Let's have another round tonight!

LAURENS
Raise a glass to the four of us!

LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON:
Ho!

MULLIGAN:
To the newly not poor of us!

LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON:
Woo!

LAFAYETTE:
We'll tell the story of tonight.

LAURENS:
Let's have another round-

HAMILTON:
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr.

BURR:
Sir!

HAMILTON:
I didn't think that you would make it.

BURR:
To be sure.

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE:
Burr!

BURR:
I came to say congratulations.

MULLIGAN:
Spit a verse, Burr!

BURR:
I see the whole gang is here.

LAFAYETTE:
You are the worst, Burr!

HAMILTON:
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel.

I wish I had your command
instead of manning George's journal.

BURR:
No, you don't.

HAMILTON:
Yes, I do.

BURR:
Now, be sensible.

From what I hear,
you've made yourself indispensable.

LAURENS:
Well, well, I heard

You've got a special someone
on the side, Burr.

HAMILTON:
Is that so?

LAURENS:
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

BURR:
I should go.

HAMILTON:
No, these guys should go.

LAFAYETTE: What?
LAURENS: No!

HAMILTON:
Leave us alone.

MULLIGAN:
Man...

HAMILTON:
It's alright, Burr.

I wish you'd brought this girl
with you tonight, Burr.

BURR:
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir.

HAMILTON:
What do you mean?

BURR:
She's married.

HAMILTON:
I see.

BURR:
She's married to a British officer.

HAMILTON:
Oh shit...

BURR:
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more.

I'll see you on the other side of the war.

HAMILTON:
I will never understand you.

If you love this woman, go get here!
What are you waiting for?

BURR:
I'll see you on the other side of the war.

HAMILTON:
I'll see you on the other side of the war.

BURR
Theodosia writes me a letter ev'ry day.

I'm keeping her bed warm
while her husband is away.

He's on the British side of Georgia.
He's tryin' to keep the colonies in line.

Well he can keep all of Georgia.
Theodosia, she's mine.

Love doesn't discriminate
between the sinners and the saints,

it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep loving anyway.

We laugh and we cry and we break
and we make our mistakes.

And if there's a reason I'm by her side
when so many have tried

then I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it.

My grandfather was a fire
of brimstone preacher,

But there are things that the
homilies and hymns won't teach ya.

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect.

When they died they left no instructions.
Just a legacy to protect.

Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints,

it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep living anyway.

We rise and we fall and we break
and we make our mistakes.

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
when everyone who loves me has died

I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it.

Wait for it!
(Wait for it)

I am the one thing in life I can control
(Wait for it!)

I am inimitable, I am an original
(Wait for it)

I'm not falling behind or running late
(Wait for it)

I'm not standing still,
I am lying in wait (Wait)

Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose (Lose)

Hamilton's pace is relentless
he wastes no time (Time)

What's it like in his shoes?
Hamilton doesn't hesitate.

He exhibits no restraint.
He takes and he takes and he takes

And he keeps winning anyway.
He changes the game.

He plays and he raises the stakes.

And if there's a reason he seems to thrive
when so few survive,

then Goddamnit I'm willing to wait for it.
(Wait for it)

I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
between the sinners and the saints

it takes and it takes and it takes

We rise.
We fall.

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many others have died,

then I'm willin' to-

Wait for it
(Wait for it)

ELIZA:
Stay alive...

ELIZA/ANGELICA:
Stay alive...

HAMILTON:
I have never seen the General so despondent

I have taken over writing
all his correspondence

Congress writes,
"George, attack the British forces."

I shoot back, we have resorted
to eating our horses

Local merchants deny us
equipment, assistance

They only take British money,
so sing a song of sixpence

WASHINGTON:
The cavalry's not coming

HAMILTON:
But, sir!

WASHINGTON:
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this

Provoke outrage, outright

HAMILTON:
That's right

WASHINGTON:
Don't engage, strike by night

Remain relentless 'til
their troops take flight

HAMILTON:
Make it impossible to justify
the cost of the fight

WASHINGTON: Outrun
HAMILTON: Outrun

WASHINGTON: Outlast
HAMILTON: Outlast

WASHINGTON:
Hit 'em quick, get out fast

HAMILTON:
Chick-a-plao!

WASHINGTON:
Stay alive 'til this horror show is past

We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE:
Raise a glass!

MULLIGAN:
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

LAFAYETTE:
I ask for French aid,
I pray that France has sent a ship

LAURENS:
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery

And every day's a test of our
camaraderie and bravery

HAMILTON:
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband

We pick and choose our battles
and places to take a stand

And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"

And ev'ry day
WASHINGTON: No

HAMILTON:
He dismisses me out of hand

HAMILTON:
Instead of me he promotes Charles Lee

Makes him second-in-command.
LEE: I'm a General. Whee!!!!

HAMILTON:
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE:
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

WASHINGTON: Ev'ryone attack!
LEE: Retreat!

WASHINGTON: Attack!
LEE: Retreat!
WASHINGTON: Ev'ryone attack!
LEE: Retreat!

WASHINGTON: Attack!
LEE: Retreat!

WASHINGTON:
What are you doing, Lee?
Get back on your feet!

LEE:
But there's so many of them!

WASHINGTON:
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!

Hamilton!
HAMILTON: Ready, sir!

WASHINGTON:
Have Lafayette take the lead!

HAMILTON:
Yes, sir!

LAURENS:
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

LAFAYETTE:
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

HAMILTON:
Charles Lee was left behind without a pot to piss in

He started sayin' this to
anybody who would listen:

LEE:
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices

Indecisive, from crisis to crisis

The best thing he can do for the revolution

Is turn n' go back to plantin'
tobacco in Mount Vernon

WASHINGTON:
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

HAMILTON:
But, sir!

WASHINGTON:
We have a war to fight, let's move along

LAURENS:
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

HAMILTON:
I can't disobey direct orders

LAURENS:
Then I'll do it

Alexander,
you're the closest friend I've got

HAMILTON:
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE:
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

It's the Ten Duel Commandments

(Number one!)
LAURENS:
The challenge: demand satisfaction

If they apologize,
no need for further action

(Number two!)
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

HAMILTON:
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

(Number three!)
LEE:
Have your seconds meet face to face

BURR:
Negotiate a peace...

HAMILTON:
Or negotiate a time and place

BURR:
This is commonplace, 'specially 'tween recruits

Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

LAURENS:
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright

Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site.

HAMILTON:
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

BURR:
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

(Five!)
LEE:
Duel before the sun is in the sky

Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

HAMILTON:
Leave a note for your next of kin

Tell 'em where you been.
Pray that hell or heaven lets you in.

(Seven!)
LEE:
Confess your sins.

Ready for the moment of adrenaline
when you finally face your opponent

(Number eight!)
LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR:
Your last chance to negotiate

Send in your seconds,
see if they can set the record straight.

BURR: Alexander
HAMILTON: Aaron Burr, sir

BURR:
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

HAMILTON:
Sure, but your man has to answer for his words, Burr

BURR:
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

HAMILTON:
Hang on, how many men died because
Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

BURR:
Okay, so we're doin' this

(Number nine!)
HAMILTON:
Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher

Summon all the courage you require
Then count

One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine

Number ten paces!

HAMILTON/BURR:
Fire!

HAMILTON:
Lee, do you yield?

BURR:
You shot him in the side! Yes, he yields!

LAURENS:
I'm satisfied

BURR:
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

HAMILTON:
Go! We won.

Here comes the General!

BURR:
This should be fun

WASHINGTON:
What is the meaning of this?
Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

BURR:
Yes, sir

WASHINGTON:
Lee, you will never agree with me

But believe me,
these young men don't speak for me

Thank you for your service

BURR:
Let's ride!

WASHINGTON: Hamilton!
HAMILTON: Sir!

WASHINGTON:
Meet me inside

Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

WASHINGTON: Son--
HAMILTON: Don't call me son

WASHINGTON:
This war is hard enough without infighting

HAMILTON:
Lee called you out. We called his bluff.

WASHINGTON:
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

HAMILTON:
You're absolutely right,
John should have shot him in the mouth

That would've shut him up

WASHINGTON: Son
HAMILTON: I'm notcha son

WASHINGTON:
Watch your tone

I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown
HAMILTON: Charles Lee, Thomas Conway

These men take your name
and they rake it through the mud

WASHINGTON:
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

HAMILTON:
Well, I don't have your name.

I don't have your titles
I don't have your land

But, if you
WASHINGTON: No.

HAMILTON:
If you gave me command of a battalion,

a group of men to lead,
I could fly above my station after the war

WASHINGTON:
Or you could die and we need you alive

HAMILTON:
I'm more than willing to die

WASHINGTON:
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive

HAMILTON:
Call me son one more time!

WASHINGTON:
Go home, Alexander

That's an order from your commander

HAMILTON: Sir
WASHINGTON: Go home!

ELIZA:
Look around, look around

At how lucky we are
to be alive right now

Look around, look around...

HAMILTON:
How long have you known?

ELIZA:
A month or so

HAMILTON:
Eliza, you should have told me

ELIZA: I wrote to the General a month ago
HAMILTON: No

ELIZA:
I begged him to send you home

HAMILTON:
You should have told me

ELIZA:
I'm not sorry

I knew you'd fight until the war was won
HAMILTON: The war's not Done.

ELIZA:
But you deserve a chance to meet your son

Look around, look around at how lucky
we are to be alive right now.

HAMILTON:
Will you relish being a poor man's wife

Unable to provide for your life?

ELIZA:
I relish being your wife

Look around, look around...

Look at where you are
Look at where you started

The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile

Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing

The worlds you keep erasing
and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married

So long as you come home
at the end of the day

That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money

If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart...

Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday

Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay

And I could be enough
And we could be enough

That would be enough

BURR:
How does a ragtag volunteer army

In need of a shower
somehow defeat a global superpower?

How do we emerge victorious
from the quagmire?

Leave the battlefield waving
Betsy Ross' flag higher?

Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!

An immigrant you know and love
who's unafraid to step in!

He's constantly confusin',
confoundin' the British henchmen

Ev'ryone give it up for America's
favorite fighting Frenchman!

Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE:
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

(Lafayette!) And I'm never gonna stop until I make 'em
Drop and burn 'em up and scatter their remains, I'm

(Lafayette!) Watch me engagin' em!
Escapin' em! Enragin' em! I'm--

(Lafayette!)
I go to France for more funds

(Lafayette!)
I come back with more guns

And ships
And so the balance shifts

WASHINGTON:
We rendezvous with Rochambeau,
consolidate their gifts
And ships
And so the balance shifts

WASHINGTON:
We rendezvous with Rochambeau,
consolidate their gifts

LAFAYETTE:
We can end this war at Yorktown,
cut them off at sea, but

For this to succeed, there is someone else we need
WASHINGOTN: I know

Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean--

(Hamilton!) Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean--

(Hamilton!) No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance--

(Hamilton!)
You wanna fight for your land back?

(Hamilton!)
WASHINGTON:
I need my right hand man back!

LAFAYETTE:
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back

You know you gotta get
ya right hand man back

I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but
the sooner the better to get your right hand man back!

WASHINGTON:
Alexander Hamilton

Troops are waiting in the field for you

If you join us right now,
together we can turn the tide

Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers that will yield for you

If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light

The world will never be the same,
Alexander...

I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command

I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand

I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me

And even now I lie awake
Knowing history has its eyes on me

History has its eyes on me.

Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:

You have no control
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you

But remember from here on in
History has its eyes on you.

History has its eyes on you

The battle of Yorktown


LAFAYETTE: Monsieur Hamilton
HAMILTON: Monsieur Lafayette

LAFAYETTE: In command where you belong
HAMILTON: How you say, no sweat

We're finally on the field,
We've had quite a run.

LAFAYETTE: Immigrants
HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE: We get the job done

HAMILTON: So what happens if we win?
LAFAYETTE: I go back to France

I bring freedom to my people
if I'm given the chance

HAMILTON:
We'll be with you when you do

LAFAYETTE:
Go lead your men

HAMILTON:
See you on the other side

LAFAYETTE:
'Til we meet again, let's go!

I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

Hey yo, I'm just like my country,
I'm young scrappy and hungry

And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

HAMILTON:
'Til the world turns upside down...

'Til the world turns upside down!

I imagine death so much
it feels more like a memory

This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me

If this is the end of me,
at least I have a friend with me

Weapon in my hand, a command,
and my men with me

Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting

We gotta go, gotta get the job done

Gotta start a new nation,
gotta meet my son!

Take the bullets out your gun!
(What?)

The bullets out your gun!
(What?)
Take the bullets out your gun!
(What?)

The bullets out your gun!
(What?)

We move under cover and we move as one

Through the night, we have
one shot to live another day

We cannot let a stray
gunshot give us away

We will fight up close,
seize the moment and stay in it

It's either that or meet the
business end of a bayonet

The code word is 'Rochambeau,' dig me?
(Rochambeau!)

You have your orders now, go, man, go!

And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds

Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

HAMILTON/LAURENS:
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

HAMILTON:
When we finally drive the British away

Lafayette is there waiting--

HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE:
In Chesapeake Bay!

HAMILTON:
How did we know that this plan would work?

We had a spy on the inside. That's right,
Hercules Mulligan!

MULLIGAN:
A tailor spyin' on the British government!

I take their measurements,
information and then I smuggle it (Up!)

To my brother's revolutionary covenant I'm
runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!

See, that's what happens when
you up against the ruffians

We in the shit now,
somebody gotta shovel it!

Hercules Mulligan,
I need no introduction

When you knock me down
I get the fuck back up again!

HAMILTON:
After a week of fighting, a young man
in a red coat stands on a parapet.

LAFAYETTE:
We lower our guns as he frantically
waves a white handkerchief.

MULLIGAN:
And just like that, it's over.
We tend to our wounded, we count our dead.

LAURENS:
Black and white soldiers wonder alike
if this really means freedom

WASHINGTON:
Not. Yet.

HAMILTON:
We negotiate the terms of surrender

I see George Washington smile

We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file

Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing

And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

The world turned upside down

The world turned upside down

The world turned upside down

The world turned upside down
Down down, down, down

LAFAYETTE:
Freedom for America, freedom for France!
The world turned upside down
Down down, down, down

LAFAYETTE:
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

Down, down, down

HAMILTON:
Gotta start a new nation! Gotta meet my son!
Down, down, down

HAMILTON:
Gotta start a new nation! Gotta meet my son!

Down, down, down
HAMILTON:
Gotta start a new nation! Gotta meet my son!

Down, down, down

MULLIGAN: We won!
LAFAYETTE: We won!
Down, down, down

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS:
We won!
MULLIGAN: We won!
LAFAYETTE: We won!
Down, down, down

Down, down, down
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS:
We won!

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS:
We won!

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON:
We won!
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS:
We won!

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON:
We won!

The world turned upside down!

KING GEORGE:
They say,

The price of my war is not a price
that they are willing to pay

Insane
You cheat with the French

Now I am fighting with France and with Spain

I am so blue

I thought that we'd made an arrangement
when you went away

You were mine to subdue
Well even despite our estrangement

I got a small query for you

What comes next?
You've been freed

Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You're on your own
Awesome. Wow.

Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise, empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

All alone, across the sea

When your people say they hate you,
don't come crawling back to me.

You're on your own...

BURR:
Dear Theodosia what to say to you

You have my eyes
You have your mother's name

When you came into the world
you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating everyday to you
Domestic life was never quite my style

When you smile, you knock me out
I fall apart and I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation

We'll bleed and fight for you
We'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation

We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you

And you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Yeah you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

HAMILTON:
Oh, Phillip when you smile I am undone, my son

Look at my son
Pride is not the word I'm looking for

There is so much more inside me now

Oh, Phillip you outshine the
morning sun, my son

When you smile, I fall apart
and I thought I was so smart

My father wasn't around

BURR:
My father wasn't around

HAMILTON:
I swear that

HAMILTON/BURR:
I'll be around for you

HAMILTON:
I'll do whatever it takes

BURR:
I'll make a million mistakes

HAMILTON/BURR:
I'll make the world safe and sound for you

You'll come of age with our young nation

We'll bleed and fight for you
We'll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation

We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you
If we lay a strong enough foundation

We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you

And you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

LAURENS:
I may not live to see our glory.

ELIZA:
Alexander? There's a letter for you.

HAMILTON:
It's from John Laurens. I'll read it later.

LAURENS:
But I will gladly join the fight.

ELIZA:
No. It's from his father.

HAMILTON:
His father?

LAURENS:
And when our children tell our story.

HAMILTON:
Will you read it for me?

LAURENS:
They'll tell the story of tonight.

ELIZA:
"On Tuesday the 27th,

"my son was killed in a gunfight against
British troops retreating from South Carolina.

"The war was already over. As you know,
John dreamed of emancipating and recruiting

"3000 men for the first all-black military regiment.
His dream of freedom for these men dies with him."

LAURENS:
Tomorrow there'll be more of us...

ELIZA:
Alexander. Are you alright?

HAMILTON:
I have so much work to do.

BURR:
After the war I went back to New York

HAMILTON:
A-After the war I went back to New York

BURR:
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

HAMILTON:
I practiced law, Burr worked next door

BURR:
Even though we started at the very same time

Alexander Hamilton began to climb

How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is non-stop!

HAMILTON:
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me

Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?

This is the first murder trial
of our brand-new nation

The liberty behind deliberation--
(Non-stop!)

I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel

BURR:
Co-counsel. Hamilton, sit down,

Our client Levi Weeks is innocent.
Call your first witness

That's all you had to say!

HAMILTON:
Okay! One more thing--

BURR:
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?

Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?

Soon that attitude may be your doom!

Why do you write like you're
running out of time?

Write day and night like you're
running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight, like you're
running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime--
(Non-stop!)

HAMILTON:
Corruption's such an old song that
we can sing along in harmony

And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling

And honestly, that's why public service (He's just)
Seems to be calling me. (Non-stop!)

I practiced the law,
I practic'ly perfected it

I've seen injustice in the world
and I've corrected it

Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates

Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

BURR:
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

HAMILTON:
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

BURR:
There as a New York junior delegate:

HAMILTON:
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

BURR:
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

(What?)
His own plan for a new form of government!

(What?)
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

Bright young man...
Yo, who the f is this?

Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?

Ev'ry proclamation guarantees
free ammunition for your enemies!

Why do you write like it's
going out of style?

Write day and night like it's
going out of style?

Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style

Do what you do

BURR: Alexander?
HAMILTON: Aaron Burr, sir

BURR:
It's the middle of the night

HAMILTON:
Can we confer, sir?

BURR:
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON:
Yes, and it's important to me

BURR:
What do you need?

HAMILTON:
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

BURR:
Okay

HAMILTON:
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive

You're incredible in court,
You're succinct, persuasive.

My client needs a strong defense.
You're the solution.

BURR:
Who's your client?

HAMILTON:
The new U.S. Constitution

BURR:
No

HAMILTON:
Hear me out

BURR:
No way!

HAMILTON:
A series of essays, anonymously published

Defending the document to the public

BURR: No one will read it
HAMILTON: I disagree

BURR:And if it fails?
HAMILTON: Burr, that's why we need it

BURR: The constitution's a mess
HAMILTON: So it needs amendments

BURR: It's full of contradictions
HAMILTON: So is independence

We have to start somewhere

BURR: No. No way
HAMILTON: You're making a mistake

BURR: Good night
HAMILTON: Hey

What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

BURR: What?
HAMILTON: We won the war

What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

BURR: Of course
HAMILTON: Then defend it

BURR:
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

HAMILTON:
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed

For the notion of a nation
we now get to build

For once in your life,
take a stand with pride

I don't understand how
you stand to the side

BURR:
I'll keep all my plans close to my chest

(Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it)
I'll wait here and see

Which way the wind will blow

I'm taking my time watching the afterbirth
of a nation watching the tension grow.

ANGELICA:
I am sailing off to London.

I'm accompanied by someone who always pays

I have found a wealthy husband who will
keep me in comfort for all my days

He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one
who can match you for turn of phrase

My Alexander

HAMILTON:
Angelica

ANGELICA:
Don't forget to write

ELIZA:
Look at where you are

Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle

Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if your wife could share
a fraction of your time

If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

BURR:
Alexander joins forces with James Madison
and John Jay to write a series of essays

Defending the new United States Constitution,
entitled The Federalist Papers.

The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays,
the work divided evenly among the three men.

In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays,
in the span of six months.

John Jay got sick after writing five.
James Madison wrote twenty-nine.

Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

How do you write like you're
Running out of time?

Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

Ev'ry day you fight like you're
Running out of time

Like you're running out of time
Are you running out of time?

How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?

How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

WASHINGTON:
They are asking me to lead

I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need

I'm asking you to be my right hand man
HAMILTON: Treasury or State?

WASHINGTON: I know it's a lot to ask
HAMILTON: Treasury or State?

WASHINGTON:
To leave behind the world you know...

HAMILTON:
Sir, do you want me to run the
Treasury or State department?

WASHINGTON:
Treasury

HAMILTON:
Let's go

ELIZA:
Alexander...

HAMILTON:
I have to leave

ELIZA:
Alexander--

HAMILTON:
Look around, look around at how
lucky we are to be alive right now

ELIZA:
Helpless...

HAMILTON:
They are asking me to lead
ELIZA:
Helpless...

HAMILTON:
They are asking me to lead

ELIZA:
Look around, isn't this enough?

ANGELICA: He will never be satisfied
ELIZA: What would be enough

ANGELICA:
He will never be satisfied

Satisfied, satisfied
WASHINGTON: History has its eyes on you!

History has its eyes on you!

HAMILTON:
I am not throwin' away my shot!
(Just you wait!)

I am not throwin' away my shot!
(Just you wait!)

I am Alexander Hamilton!
(Alexander Hamilton! Hamilton!)

(Just you wait!)
I am not throwin' away my shot!

ACT II

Oh, Iâ€™ve got to be in
The room where it happensâ€¦

Iâ€™ve got to be, Iâ€™ve gotta be,
Iâ€™ve gotta beâ€¦

In the room!

What?

AARON BURR:
1789!

How does the bastard orphan
Immigrant decorated war vet

Unite the colonies through more debt?
Fight the other founding fathers til he has to forfeit?

Have it all, lose it all
You ready for more yet?

Treasury Secretary. Washingtonâ€™s the President
Evâ€™ry American experiment sets a precedent

Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him
Pissed him off until we had a two-party system

You havenâ€™t met him yet, you havenâ€™t had the chance
â€˜cause heâ€™s been kickinâ€™ ass as the ambassador to France

But someoneâ€™s gotta keep the American promise
You simply must meet Thomas. Thomas!

JEFFERSON:
France is following us to revolution

There is no more status quo
But the sun comes up and the world still spins

I helped Lafayette draft a declaration
Then I said, â€˜I gotta go

I gotta be in Monticello.â€™ Now the work at
Home beginsâ€¦

So whatâ€™d I miss?
Whatâ€™d I miss?

Virginia, my home sweet home,
I wanna give you a kiss

Iâ€™ve been in Paris meeting lots of different ladies...
I guess I basicâ€™lly missed the late eighties...

I traveled the wide, wide world and came back to thisâ€¦

Thereâ€™s a letter on my desk from the President
Havenâ€™t even put my bags down yet

Sally be a lamb, darlinâ€™, wonâ€™tcha open it?
It says the Presidentâ€™s assembling a cabinet

And that I am to be the Secretary of State, great!
And that Iâ€™m already Senate-approved...

I just got home and now Iâ€™m headed up to New York

Lookinâ€™ at the rolling fields
I canâ€™t believe that we are free

Ready to face
Whateverâ€™s awaiting me in NYC

But whoâ€™s waitinâ€™ for me when I step in the place?
My friend James Madison, red in the face

He grabs my arm and
I respond â€œWhatâ€™s goinâ€™ on?â€

MADISON:
Thomas, we are engaged in a battle

For our nationâ€™s very soul
Can you get us out of the mess weâ€™re in?

Hamiltonâ€™s new financial plan is nothing less
Than government control

Iâ€™ve been fighting for the South alone
Where have you been?

JEFFERSON:
Uh...France.

MADISON:
We have to win

JEFFERSON:
Whatâ€™d I miss?

Headfirst into a political abyss!

I have my first cabinet meeting today
I guess I better think of something to say

Iâ€™m already on my way
Letâ€™s get to the bottom of thisâ€¦

WASHINGTON:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

HAMILTON:
Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton

WASHINGTON AND ENSEMBLE:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

Mr. Jefferson, welcome home
Sir, youâ€™ve been off in Paris for so long!

JEFFERSON:
So what did I miss?

WASHINGTON:
Ladies and gentlemen
JEFFERSON:
So what did I miss?

WASHINGTON:
Ladies and gentlemen

You coulda been anywhere in the world tonight,
but youâ€™re here with us in New York City.

Are you ready for a cabinet meeting?

The issue on the table:
Secretary Hamiltonâ€™s plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank.

Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir

JEFFERSON:
â€˜Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.â€™

We fought for these ideals; we shouldnâ€™t settle for less
These are wise words, enterprising men quote â€˜em

Donâ€™t act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote â€˜em

But Hamilton forgets
His plan would have the government assume stateâ€™s debts

Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits

HAMILTON:
Not true!

JEFFERSON:
Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it

If New Yorkâ€™s in debtâ€”
Why should Virginia bear it? Uh!

Our debts are paid, Iâ€™m afraid
Donâ€™t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade

In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground
We create. You just wanna move our money around

This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And itâ€™s too many damn pages for any man to understand

Stand with me in the land of the free
And pray to God we never see Hamiltonâ€™s candidacy

Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky
Imagine what gonâ€™ happen when you try to tax our whisky

WASHINGTON:
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson.

Secretary Hamilton, your response

HAMILTON:
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration
Secretary Hamilton, your response

HAMILTON:
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration

Welcome to the present, weâ€™re running a real nation
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow

Doinâ€™ whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets

A new line of credit, a financial diuretic
How do you not get it? If weâ€™re aggressive and competitive

The union gets a boost. Youâ€™d rather give it a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor

Your debts are paid cuz you donâ€™t pay for labor
â€œWe plant seeds in the South. We create.â€

Yeah, keep ranting
We know whoâ€™s really doing the planting

And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment
Donâ€™t lecture me about the war, you didnâ€™t fight in it

You think Iâ€™m frightened of you, man?
We almost died in a trench

While you were off getting high with the French
Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President

Reticentâ€”there isnâ€™t a plan he doesnâ€™t jettison
Madison, youâ€™re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine

Damn, youâ€™re in worse shape than the national debt is in
Sittinâ€™ there useless as two shits

Hey, turn around, bend over, Iâ€™ll show you
Where my shoe fits

WASHINGTON:
Excuse me? Jefferson, Madison, take a walk!

Hamilton, take a walk!
Weâ€™ll reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!

HAMILTON:
Sir!

WASHINGTON:
A word

MADISON:
You donâ€™t have the votes

JEFFERSON/MADISON:
You donâ€™t have the votes

Youâ€™re gonna need congressional approval
and you donâ€™t have the votes

JEFFERSON:
Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder

WASHINGTON:
You wanna pull yourself together?

HAMILTON:
Iâ€™m sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather

WASHINGTON:
Young man, Iâ€™m from Virginia, so watch your mouth

HAMILTON:
So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?

WASHINGTON:
You need the votes

HAMILTON:
No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan

WASHINGTON:
No, you need to convince more folks

HAMILTON:
James Madison wonâ€™t talk to me, thatâ€™s a nonstarter

WASHINGTON:
Winning was easy, young man. Governingâ€™s harder

HAMILTON:
Theyâ€™re being intransigent

WASHINGTON:
You have to find a compromise

HAMILTON:
But they donâ€™t have a plan, they just hate mine!

WASHINGTON:
Convince them otherwise

HAMILTON:
What happens if I donâ€™t get congressional approval?

WASHINGTON:
I imagine theyâ€™ll call for your removal

HAMILTON:
Sirâ€”

Thatâ€™s an order from your commander
WASHINGTON:
Figure it out, Alexander.

ELIZA:

HAMILTON:
My dearest, Angelica

â€œTomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to dayâ€

I trust youâ€™ll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play

They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
Iâ€™m a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain

Madison is Banquo, Jeffersonâ€™s Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

HAMILTON & ANGELICA:
And there you are, an ocean away

Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside

Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion awayâ€¦

ELIZA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
I am on my way

ELIZA:
Thereâ€™s a little surprise before supper

And it cannot wait

HAMILTON:
Iâ€™ll be there in just a minute, save my plate

ELIZA:
Alexander

HAMILTON:
Okay, okay
ELIZA:
Alexander

HAMILTON:
Okay, okay

ELIZA:
Your son is nine years old today

Has something heâ€™d like to say
Heâ€™s been practicing all day

Philip, take it away

PHILIP:
Daddy, daddy, look

My name is Philip
I am a poet

I wrote this poem just
To show it

And I just turned nine

You can write rhymes
But you canâ€™t write mine

I practice French
And play piano with my mother

I have a sister, but I want a little brother

My daddyâ€™s trying to start Americaâ€™s bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq!

HAMILTON:
Bravo!
My daddyâ€™s trying to start Americaâ€™s bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq!

HAMILTON:
Bravo!

ELIZA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
Hey, our kid is pretty great

ELIZA:
Run away with us for the summer
Letâ€™s go upstate

HAMILTON:
Eliza, Iâ€™ve got so much on my plate

ELIZA:
We can all go stay with my father

Thereâ€™s a lake I knowâ€¦

HAMILTON:
I know
Thereâ€™s a lake I knowâ€¦

HAMILTON:
I know

ELIZA:
In a nearby park

HAMILTON:
Iâ€™d love to go

ELIZA:
You and I can go when the night gets darkâ€¦

HAMILTON:
I will try to get away

ANGELICA:
My dearest Alexander

You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise

Donâ€™t stop â€˜til you agree
Your favâ€™rite older sister

Angelica, reminds you
Thereâ€™s someone in your corner all the way across the sea

In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase

It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and youâ€™ve consumed my waking days

It says:

HAMILTON & ANGELICA:
â€œMy dearest Angelicaâ€

ANGELICA:
With a comma after â€œdearest.â€ Youâ€™ve written

HAMILTON AND ANGELICA:
â€œMy dearest, Angelica.â€

ANGELICA:
Anyway, all this to say

Iâ€™m coming home this summer
At my sisterâ€™s invitation

Iâ€™ll be there with your famâ€™ly
If you make your way upstate

I know youâ€™re very busy
I know your workâ€™s important

But Iâ€™m crossing the ocean and I just canâ€™t wait

HAMILTON AND ANGELICA:
You wonâ€™t be an ocean away

You will only be a moment awayâ€¦

ELIZA:
Alexander, come downstairs.

Angelicaâ€™s arriving today!

Angelica!

ANGELICA:
Eliza!

HAMILTON:
The Schuyler sisters!

ANGELICA:
Alexander

HAMILTON:
Hi

ANGELICA:
Itâ€™s good to see your face

ELIZA:
Angelica, tell this man ...

John Adams spends the summer with his family

HAMILTON:
Angelica, tell my wife ...

John Adams doesnâ€™t have a real job anyway

ANGELICA:
â€¦youâ€™re not joining us? Wait

HAMILTON:
Iâ€™m afraid I cannot join you upstate

ANGELICA:
Alexander, I came all this way

ELIZA:
She came all this way

ANGELICA:
All this way

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
You know I have to get my plan through Congress

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Run away with us for the summer

Letâ€™s go upstate

HAMILTON:
I lose my job if I donâ€™t get my plan through Congress

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
We can all go stay with our father

ELIZA:
Thereâ€™s a lake I know

ANGELICA:
I know Iâ€™ll miss your face
ELIZA:
Thereâ€™s a lake I know

ANGELICA:
Screw your courage to the sticking place

ELIZA:
You and I can go

Screw your courage to the sticking place

ELIZA:
You and I can go

ANGELICA:
Elizaâ€™s right
ELIZA:
You and I can go

ANGELICA:
Elizaâ€™s right

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Take a break and get away

ANGELICA:
Run away with us for the summer
ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Take a break and get away

ANGELICA:
Run away with us for the summer

ELIZA:
Letâ€™s go upstate
Where we can stay

ANGELICA:
We can all go stay with our father
If you take your time

ELIZA:
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now

ANGELICA:
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream
ELIZA:
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now

ANGELICA:
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream

ELIZA:
We can go
ANGELICA:
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
When the night gets dark
Take a break.
ANGELICA:
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
When the night gets dark
Take a break.

HAMILTON:
I have to get my plan through Congress

I canâ€™t stop until I get this plan through Congress

BURR:
Thereâ€™s nothing like summer in the city

Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty

Thereâ€™s trouble in the air, you can smell it
And Alexanderâ€™s by himself. Iâ€™ll let him tell it

HAMILTON:
I hadnâ€™t slept in a week

I was weak, I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan

More in need of a break
Longing for Angelica

Missing my wife
Thatâ€™s when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:

MARIA:
I know you are a man of honor

Iâ€™m so sorry to bother you at home
But I donâ€™t know where to go, and I came here all aloneâ€¦

HAMILTON:
She said:

MARIA:
My husbandâ€™s doinâ€™ me wrong

Beatinâ€™ me, cheatinâ€™ me, mistreatinâ€™ me...
Suddenly heâ€™s up and gone

I donâ€™t have the means to go on

HAMILTON:
So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said

MARIA:
Youâ€™re too kind, sir

HAMILTON:
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away

She lived a block away, she said:

MARIA:
This oneâ€™s mine, sir

HAMILTON:
Then I said, â€œwell, I should head back home,â€

She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said:

MARIA:
Stay?

HAMILTON:
Heyâ€¦

MARIA:
Heyâ€¦

HAMILTON:
Thatâ€™s when I began to pray:

Lord, show me how to
Say no to this

I donâ€™t know how to
Say no to this

But my God, she looks so helpless
And her bodyâ€™s saying, â€œhell, yesâ€

MARIA:
Whoa...

HAMILTON:
Nooo, show me how to
MARIA:
Whoa...

MARIA:
Whoa...

Say no to this
I donâ€™t know how to
MARIA:
Whoa...

Say no to this
I donâ€™t know how to

Say no to this
In my mind, Iâ€™m tryinâ€™ to go

Then her mouth is on mine, and I donâ€™t sayâ€¦

No! No!
Say no to this!

I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time. It became a pastime

A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:

JAMES:
Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health

And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck

You see, that was my wife who you decided to

HAMILTON:
Fuuuu

JAMES:
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold
HAMILTON:
Fuuuu

JAMES:
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold

So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seeinâ€™ my whore wife

If the price is right: if not Iâ€™m telling your wife

HAMILTON:
I hid the letter and I raced to her place

Screamed â€œHow could you?!â€ in her face
She said:

MARIA:
No, sir!

HAMILTON:
Half dressed, apologetic.
MARIA:
No, sir!

HAMILTON:
Half dressed, apologetic.

A mess, she looked
Pathetic, she cried:

MARIA:
Please donâ€™t go, sir!

HAMILTON:
So was your whole story a setup?

MARIA:
I donâ€™t know about any letter!

HAMILTON:
Stop crying Goddamnit, get up!

MARIA:
I didnâ€™t know any better

HAMILTON:
I am ruined...

MARIA:
Please donâ€™t leave me with him helpless

HAMILTON:
I am helplessâ€”how could I do this?
MARIA:
Please donâ€™t leave me with him helpless

HAMILTON:
I am helplessâ€”how could I do this?

MARIA:
Just give him what he wants and you can have me

HAMILTON:
I donâ€™t want you
MARIA:
Just give him what he wants and you can have me

HAMILTON:
I donâ€™t want you

MARIA:
Whatever you want

MARIA:
If you pay
You can stay

HAMILTON
Lord, show me how to say no to this

I donâ€™t know how to
Say no to this

Cuz the situationâ€™s helpless
And her bodyâ€™s screaming, â€œHell, yesâ€

No, show me how to
Say no to this

How can I
Say no to this?

There is nowhere I can go

When her bodyâ€™s on mine
I do not sayâ€¦

ENSEMBLE:
No!

HAMILTON
Yes!

ENSEMBLE:
No!

HAMILTON
Yes!

ENSEMBLE:
No!

HAMILTON
Yes!

ENSEMBLE:
No!

HAMILTON
Yes!

HAMILTON:
Say no to thisâ€¦

I donâ€™t say no to this
There is nowhere I can go.

JAMES:
So?

HAMILTON:
Nobody needs to know

BURR:
Ah, Mister Secretary

HAMILTON:
Mister Burr, sir

BURR:
Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?

HAMILTON:
No

BURR:
You know Clermont Street?

HAMILTON:
Yeah

BURR:
They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure

HAMILTON:
Sure

BURR:
And all he had to do was die

HAMILTON:
Thatâ€™s a lot less work

BURR:
We oughta give it a try

Now howâ€™re you gonna get your debt plan through?

HAMILTON:
I guess Iâ€™m gonna finâ€™ly have to listen to you

BURR:
Really?

HAMILTON:
â€œTalk less. Smile more.â€

Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor

BURR:
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless.

HAMILTON:
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner

MADISON:
Hamilton!

HAMILTON:
Iâ€™m sorry Burr, Iâ€™ve gotta go

BURR:
Butâ€”

HAMILTON:
Decisions are happening over dinner

BURR:
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room

Diametricâ€™ly opposed, foes
They emerge with a compromise

Having opened doors that were
Previously closed (Bros!)

The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants

The Virginians emerge with the nationâ€™s capital
And hereâ€™s the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance:

No one else was in
The room where it happened

The room where it happened
The room where it happened

No one else was in
The room where it happened

The room where it happened
The room where it happened

No one really knows how the game is played
The art of the trade

How the sausage gets made
We just assume that it happens

But no one else is in
The room where it happens.

Thomas claims

JEFFERSON:
Alexander was on Washingtonâ€™s doorstep one day

In distress â€˜n disarray

BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims

JEFFERSON:
Alexander said

HAMILTON:
Iâ€™ve nowhere else to turn!

JEFFERSON:
And basicâ€™ly begged me to join the fray

BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims

JEFFERSON:
I approached Madison and said

â€œI know you hate â€˜im, but letâ€™s hear what he has to say.â€

BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims

JEFFERSON:
Well, I arranged the meeting

I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating

BURR:
But! No one else was in
The room where it happened

The room where it happened
The room where it happened

No one else was in
The room where it happened

The room where it happened
The room where it happened

No one really knows how the
Parties get to yesssss

The pieces that are sacrificed in
Evâ€™ry game of chesssss

We just assume that it happens

But no one else is in
The room where it happens.

Meanwhile
Madison is grappling with the fact

that not evâ€™ry issue can be settled by committee

Meanwhile
Congress is fighting over where to put the capitalâ€”

It isnâ€™t pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite

And Madison responds with Virginian insight:

MADISON:
Maybe we can solve one problem with another

and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words

JEFFERSON:
Oh-ho!

MADISON:
A quid pro quo

JEFFERSON:
I suppose

MADISON:
Wouldnâ€™t you like to work a little closer to home?

JEFFERSON:
Actually, I would

MADISON:
Well, I propose the Potomac

JEFFERSON:
And youâ€™ll provide him his votes?

MADISON:
Well, weâ€™ll see how it goes

JEFFERSON:
Letâ€™s go

BURR:
No!

-one else was in
The room where it happened

The room where it happened
The room where it happened

No one else was in
The room where it happened

The room where it happened
The room where it happened

My God!
In God we trust

But weâ€™ll never really know what got discussed
Click-boom then it happened

And no one else was in the room where it happened

Alexander Hamilton!

What did they say to you to get you
to sell New York City down the river?

Alexander Hamilton!

Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?

Alexander Hamilton!

Or did you know, even then, it doesnâ€™t matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital?

HAMILTON:
Cuz weâ€™ll have the banks, weâ€™re in the same spot

BURR:
You got more than you gave

HAMILTON:
And I wanted what I got

When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you donâ€™t get a win unless you play in the game

Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it
You get nothing if youâ€¦

Wait for it, wait for it, wait!

God help and forgive me
I wanna build

Something thatâ€™s gonna
Outlive me

What do you want, Burr?
What do you want, Burr?

If you stand for nothing
Burr, then what do you fall for?

I - I wanna be in

The room where it happens
The room where it happens

I wanna be in
The room where it happens

The room where it happens

I - I wanna be in

The room where it happens

I - I wanna be in

The room - oh!

I wanna be, I wanna be,
I've gotta be, I've gotta be

In that room
That big ol' room

The art of the compromiseâ€”

Hold your nose and close your eyes

We want our leaders to save the dayâ€”

But we donâ€™t get a say in what they trade away

We dream of a brand new startâ€”

But we dream in the dark for the most part

Dark as a tomb where it happens

Iâ€™ve got to be in
The roomâ€¦

Iâ€™ve got to be...
Iâ€™ve got to be...

Click-boom!

PHILLIP:
Look!

Grandpaâ€™s in the paper!

â€œWar hero Philip Schuyler loses senate seat
to young upstart Aaron Burrâ€

Grandpa just lost his seat in the senate

ELIZA:
Sometimes thatâ€™s how it goes

PHILLIP:
Daddyâ€™s gonna find out any minute

ELIZA:
Iâ€™m sure he already knows

PHILLIP:
Further down

PHILLIP & ELIZA:
Further down

PHILLIP:
Letâ€™s meet the newest senator from New York

ELIZA:
New York

PHILLIP & ELIZA:
Our senator

HAMILTON:
Burr?

Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?

BURR:
Since being one put me on the up and up again

HAMILTON:
No one knows who you are or what you do

BURR:
They donâ€™t need to know me

They donâ€™t like you

HAMILTON:
Excuse me?

BURR:
Oh, Wall Street thinks youâ€™re great

Youâ€™ll always be adored by the things you create
But upstateâ€”

HAMILTON:
Wait

BURR:
â€”people think youâ€™re crooked
Schuylerâ€™s seat was up for grabs so I took it

HAMILTON:
Iâ€™ve always considered you a friend

BURR:
I donâ€™t see why that has to end

HAMILTON:
You changed parties to run against my father-in-law

BURR:
I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw

I swear your pride will be the death of us all
Beware, it goeth before the fall

WASHINGTON:
The issue on the table:

France is on the verge of war with England,

and do we provide aid and our troops to our French allies
or do we stay out of it?

Remember, my decision on this matter is not subject
to congressional approval.

The only person you have to convince is me.
Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir.

JEFFERSON:
When we were on deathâ€™s door

When we were needy
We made a promise

We signed a treaty
We need money and guns and half a chance

Uh, who provided those funds?

MADISON:
France.

JEFFERSON:
In return, they didnâ€™t ask for land,

Only a promise that weâ€™d lend a hand
And stand with them

If they fought against oppressors
And revolution is messy

But now is the time to stand!
Stand with our brothers

As they fight against tyranny.
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he

Would rather not have this debate;
Iâ€™ll remind you that he is not Secretary of State!

He knows nothing of loyalty
Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty

Desperate to rise above his station,
Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation.

Hey, and if you donâ€™t know, now you know, Mr. President.

WASHINGTON
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson.

Secretary Hamilton, your response?

HAMILTON:
You must be out of your goddamn mind

If you think
The President is going to bring the nation to the brink

Of meddling in the middle of a military mess,
A game of chess,

Where France is Queen and King-less.
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket,

Would you like to take it out and ask it?
Should we honor our treaty, King Louisâ€™s head?

â€œUh, do whatever you want Iâ€™m super dead!â€

WASHINGTON:
Enough enough, Hamilton is right.

JEFFERSON:
Mr. President!

WASHINGTON:
Weâ€™re too fragile to start another fight.

JEFFERSON:
But sir, do we not fight for freedom?

WASHINGTON:
Sure, when the French figure out whoâ€™s gonna lead â€˜em.

JEFFERSON:
The people are leading!

WASHINGTON:
The people are rioting! Thereâ€™s a difference!

Frankly itâ€™s a little disquieting
You would let your ideals blind you to reality!

Hamilton?

HAMILTON:
Sir!

WASHINGTON:
Draft the statement of neutrality.

JEFFERSON:
Did you forget Lafayette?

HAMILTON:
What?

JEFFERSON:
Have you an ounce of regret?

You accumulate debt, you accumulate power.
Yet in their hour of need, you forget.

HAMILTON:
Lafayetteâ€™s a smart man, heâ€™ll be fine.

And before he was your friend, he was mine.
If we try to fight in every revolution in the world,

We never stop. Where do we draw the line?

JEFFERSON:
So quick witted.

HAMILTON:
Alas, I admit it.

JEFFERSON:
I bet you were quite a lawyer.

HAMILTON:
My defendants got acquitted

JEFFERSON:
Yeah, well someone ought to remind you

HAMILTON:
What?

JEFFERSON:
Youâ€™re nothing without Washington behind you.

WASHINGTON:
Hamilton!

JEFFERSON:
Daddyâ€™s calling!

BURR:
It must be nice, it must be nice

To have Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice

To have Washington on your side

JEFFERSON:
Ev'ry action has its equal, opposite reactions.

Thanks to Hamilton, our cabinetâ€™s fractured into factions.

Try not to crack under the stress,
weâ€™re breaking down like fractions.

We smack each other in the press,
and we donâ€™t print retractions.

I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens
and dresses like the pits of fashion

Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs â€˜em blind in search of chips to cash in

This prick is asking for someone to bring him to task

Somebody give me some dirt on this vacuous mass
so we can at last unmask him

Iâ€™ll pull the trigger on him,
someone load the gun and cock it

While we were all watching,
he got Washington in his pocket

It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

Look back at the Bill of Rights

MADISON:
Which I wrote!

BURR & JEFFERSON:
The ink hasn't dried

It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

MADISON:
So heâ€™s doubled the size of the government

Wasn't the trouble with much of our previous government size?

BURR:
Look in his eyes

JEFFERSON:
See how he lies

MADISON:
Follow the scent of his enterprise

JEFFERSON:
Centralizing national credit and making
American credit competitive

MADISON:
If we donâ€™t stop it, we aid and abet it.

JEFFERSON:
I have to resign!

MADISON:
Somebody has to stand up for the South!

BURR:
Well, somebody has to stand up to his mouth!

JEFFERSON:
If thereâ€™s a fire youâ€™re trying to douse

You canâ€™t put it out from inside the house!

Iâ€™m in the cabinet, I am complicit
In watching him grabbin' at power and kiss it.

If Washington isnâ€™t gonâ€™ listen to disciplined dissidents,
This is the difference, this kid is OUT!

ALL:
OH! This immigrant isnâ€™t somebody we chose!

OH! This immigrantâ€™s keeping us all on our toes!

OH! Letâ€™s show these Federalists what theyâ€™re up against!

OH! Southern motherfucking Democratic-Republicans!

OH! Letâ€™s follow the money and see where it goes!

OH! Because every second, the treasury grows!

OH! If we follow the money and see where it leads

Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of Hamiltonâ€™s misdeeds!

It must be nice, it must be niceâ€¦

MADISON:
Follow the money and see where it goes!

ALL:
It must be nice, it must be niceâ€¦

JEFFERSON:
The emperor has no clothes

ALL:
We wonâ€™t be invisible

We wonâ€™t be denied!

Stillâ€¦

It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

HAMILTON:
Mr. President, you asked to see me?

WASHINGTON:
I know youâ€™re busy

HAMILTON:
What do you need, sir?

Sir?

WASHINGTON:
I wanna give you a word of warning

HAMILTON:
Sir, I donâ€™t know what you heard

But whatever it is, Jefferson started it

WASHINGTON:
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning

HAMILTON:
Youâ€™re kidding

WASHINGTON:
I need a favor

HAMILTON:
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior!

WASHINGTON:
Shh. Talk less

HAMILTON:
Iâ€™ll use the press

Iâ€™ll write under a pseudonym,
youâ€™ll see what I can do to him

WASHINGTON:
I need you to draft an address

HAMILTON:
Yes! He resigned.

You can finally speak your mind

WASHINGTON:
No ...

Heâ€™s stepping down so he can run for President

HAMILTON:
Ha! Good luck defeating you, sir.

WASHINGTON:
Iâ€™m stepping down.

Iâ€™m not running for President

HAMILTON:
Iâ€™m sorry, what?

WASHINGTON:
One last time

Relax, have a drink with me
One last time

Letâ€™s take a break tonight
And then weâ€™ll teach them how to say goodbye

To say goodbye
You and I

HAMILTON:
No, sir, why?

WASHINGTON:
I wanna talk about neutrality

HAMILTON:
Sir

With Britain and France on the verge of war,
is this the best time ...

WASHINGTON:
I want to warn against partisan fighting

HAMILTON:
Butâ€”

WASHINGTON:
Pick up a pen, start writing

I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard-won wisdom I have earned

HAMILTON:
As far as the people are concerned

You have to serve, you could continue to serve

WASHINGTON:
No!
You have to serve, you could continue to serve

WASHINGTON:
No!

One last time
The people will hear from me

One last time
And if we get this right

Weâ€™re gonna teach â€˜em how to say
Goodbye

You and I

HAMILTON:
Mr. President, they will say youâ€™re weak

WASHINGTON:
No, they will see weâ€™re strong

HAMILTON:
Your position is so unique

WASHINGTON:
So Iâ€™ll use it to move them along

HAMILTON:
Why do you have to say goodbye?

WASHINGTON:
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on

It outlives me when Iâ€™m gone

Like the scripture says:

â€œEveryone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid.â€

Theyâ€™ll be safe in the nation weâ€™ve made

I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade

At home in this nation weâ€™ve made
One last time

HAMILTON:
One last time

Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration,
I am unconscious of intentional error

I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects
Not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors.

I shall also carry with me
The hope

That my country will
View them with indulgence

And that after forty-five years of my life
Dedicated to its service with an upright zeal

The faults of incompetent abilities will be
Consigned to oblivion, as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest

I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which
I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking

In the midst of my fellow-citizens,
The benign influence of good laws under a free government
The ever-favorite object of my heart

And the happy reward, as I trust
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.

One last time

COMPANY:
George Washingtonâ€™s going home!

HAMILTON:
Teach â€˜em how to say goodbye

COMPANY:
George Washingtonâ€™s going home

WASHINGTON:
You and I

COMPANY:
George Washingtonâ€™s going home

WASHINGTON:
Going home

COMPANY:
George Washingtonâ€™s going home

WASHINGTON:
History has its eyes on you
COMPANY:
George Washingtonâ€™s going home

WASHINGTON:
History has its eyes on you

COMPANY:
George Washingtonâ€™s going home
WASHINGTON:
History has its eyes on you

COMPANY:
George Washingtonâ€™s going home

WASHINGTON:
Weâ€™re gonna teach â€˜em how to
Say goodbye!

Teach â€˜em how to
Say goodbye!

To say goodbye!
Say goodbye!

One last time!

KING GEORGE III:
They say

George Washington's yielding his power and stepping away

Is that true?
I wasn't aware that was something a person could do

I'm perplexed.
Are they going to keep on replacing whoever's in charge?

If so who's next?
There's nobody else in their country who looms quite as large

John Adams?

I know him
That can't be

That's that little guy who spoke to me
All those years ago

What was it, '85?
That poor man they're going to eat him alive!

Ocean's rise, empires fall
Next to Washington they all look small

All alone, watch them run

They will tear each other in to pieces
Jesus Christ this will be fun!

President John Adams

Good luck!

BURR:
How does Hamilton

the short-tempered, protean creator
of the coast guard,

founder of the New York Post
ardently abuse his cabinet post

destroy his reputation?
Welcome folks, to the Adamâ€™s Administration.

Jeffersonâ€™s the runner-up
which makes him the vice-president

JEFFERSON:
Washington canâ€™t help you now

No more Mr. Nice President

BURR:
Adams fires Hamilton

Privately calls him creole bastard in his toss

Hamilton publishes his response.

HAMILTON:
An open letter to the fat, arrogant

anti-charismatic national embarrassment
known as President John Adams

(Shit!)
The man's irrational, he claims that I'm in league
With Britain in some vast, international intrigue

Bitch, please!
You wouldn't know what I'm doin'

You're always goin' berserk
but you never show up to work

Give my regards to Abigail
next time you write about my lack of moral compass

At least I'm doin' my job up in this rumpus

(Oh!)
Oh and the lineâ€™s behind me,
Iâ€™ve crossed it again while the president lost it again

Aww, such a rough life
Better run to ya' wife

Yo, the boss is in Boston again
Lemme ask you a question: Who sits

at your desk when you're in Massachusetts?
They were calling you a dick back in '76

And you haven't done anything new since!
You nuisance with no sense!

You will die of irrelevance!

Go ahead: You can call me the Devil
You aspire to my level
You aspire to malevolence!

Say hi to the Jeffersons!

And the spies all around me
Maybe they can confirm

I don't care if I kill my career with this letter
I'm confining you to one term

HAMILTON:
Sit down John

You fat motherf-!

JEFFERSON:
Hamiltonâ€™s out of control,

MADISON:
This is great:

Heâ€™s out of power,
he holds no office

and he just destroyed president John Adams
the only other significant member of his party

JEFFERSON:
Hamilton is a host unto himself

As long as he can hold a pen,
heâ€™s a threat.

Letâ€™s let him know what we know.

HAMILTON:
Mr. Vice President

Mr. Madison

Senator Burr

What is this?

JEFFERSON:
We have the check stubs. From separate accountsâ€¦

MADISON:
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amountsâ€¦

BURR:
To a Mr. James Reynolds

Way back in
Seventeen ninety-one

HAMILTON:
Is that what you have? Are you done?

MADISON:
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position

JEFFERSON:
Though â€˜virtueâ€™ is not a word Iâ€™d apply to this situation

MADISON:
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission

JEFFERSON:
And the evidence suggests youâ€™ve engaged in speculation

BURR:
An immigrant embezzling our government funds

JEFFERSON/MADISON:
I can almost see the headline, your career is done

BURR:
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons

BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON:
Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from!

HAMILTON:
Ha!

You donâ€™t even know what youâ€™re asking me to confess

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Confess

HAMILTON:
You have nothing.

I donâ€™t have to tell you anything at all
Unless

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Unless

HAMILTON:
If I can prove that I never broke the law

Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?

BURR:
No one else was in the room where it happened

HAMILTON:
Is that a yes?

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Um, yes

BURR:
â€œDear Sir,

I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth

In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, it was my wife who you decided toâ€

JEFFERSON:
Whaaaatâ€”

HAMILTON:
She courted me

Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
Thatâ€™s when Reynolds extorted me

For a sordid fee
I paid him quarterly

I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly!

As you can see I kept a record
Of every check in my checkered history

Check it again against your list nâ€™ see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasnâ€™t mine

You sent the dogs after my scent, thatâ€™s fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame

But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action

Are my answers to your satisfaction?

JEFFERSON:
My God

MADISON:
Gentlemen, letâ€™s go

HAMILTON:
So?

JEFFERSON AND MADISON:
The people won't know what we know

HAMILTON:
Burr!

How do I know you wonâ€™t use this against me
The next time we go toe to toe?

BURR:
Alexander, rumors only grow.

And we both
Know what we know

HAMILTON:
In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet

For just a moment
A yellow sky

When I was seventeen a hurricane
Destroyed my town

I didnâ€™t drown
I couldnâ€™t seem to die

I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see

I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me

They passed a plate around
Total strangers

Moved to kindness by my story

Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York boundâ€¦

I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution

I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell

I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well

And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence

And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance

In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet

For just a moment
A yellow sky

I was twelve when my mother died
She was holding me

We were sick and she was holding me
I couldnâ€™t seem to die

BURR:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for itâ€¦

HAMILTON:
Iâ€™ll write my way outâ€¦

BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for itâ€¦

HAMILTON:
Write evâ€™rything down, far as I can seeâ€¦

BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, waitâ€¦

HAMILTON:

Overwhelm them with honesty.

This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only
Way I can protect my legacyâ€¦

JEFFERSON/MADISON/ANGELICA:
Have you read this?

BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON:
Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair

And he wrote it down right there

MADISON:
Highlights!

HAMILTON/JEFFERSON:
â€œThe charge against me

Is a connection with one
James Reynolds!

For purposes of
Improper speculation

My real crime is an
Amorous connection with his wife

For a considerable time
With his knowing consent

MADISON/BURR/JEFFERSON:
Damn!

HAMILTON/JEFFERSON/MADISON:
â€œI had frequent meetings with her
Most of them at my own house.â€

BURR:
At his own house!

MADISON:
At his own house!

DEEP VOICE:
Damn!

HAMILTON/JEFFERSON:
â€œMrs. Hamilton with our children being absent
On a visit to her father.â€

MADISON/BURR:
Noâ€¦

Angelica

All the way from London?!

Damn

HAMILTON:
Angelica, thank God

Someone who understands what Iâ€™m
Struggling here to do

ANGELICA:
Iâ€™m not here for you

COMPANY:
Oooooh!

ANGELICA:
I know my sister like I know my own mind

You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
I love my sister more than anything in this life

I will choose her happiness over mine every time

Put what we had aside
Iâ€™m standing at her side

You could never be satisfied
God, I hope youâ€™re satisfied

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Well, heâ€™s never gonâ€™ be President now

Well, heâ€™s never gonâ€™ be President now

Thatâ€™s one less thing to worry about.

JEFFERSON/MADISON/HAMILTON:
Hey!

At least he was
honest with our money!

Well heâ€™s never gonâ€™

Hey!

At least he was honest
with our money!

Thatâ€™s one less thing
to worry about.

The Reynolds Pamphlet

Have you read this?

You ever see somebody ruin their own life?

His poor wife

ELIZA HAMILTON
I saved every letter you wrote me

From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine

You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?

She said: "Be careful with that one, love
he will do what it takes to survive."

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless

You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals

I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me
I'm searching and scanning for answers

In every line
For some kind of sign

And when you were mine
The world seemed to burn

Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought this girl

Into our bed

In clearing your name
You have ruined our lives

Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you'd done?

She said: "You have married an Icarus.
He has flown too close to the sun."

You and your words obsessed with your legacy
Your sentences border on senseless

And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you-

You, you, you

I'm erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder

How Eliza reacted
When you broke her heart

You have torn it all apart
I'm watching it burn

Watching it burn

The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed

They don't get to know what I said
I'm burning the memories

Burning the letters
that might have redeemed you

You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed

You'll sleep in your office instead

With only the memories
of when you were mine

I hope that you burn

PHILIP:
Meet the latest graduate of Kingâ€™s College!

I probâ€™ly shouldnâ€™t brag, but, dag, I amaze and astonish!
The scholars say
I got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops!

The ladies say my brainâ€™s not where the resemblance stops!
Iâ€™m only nineteen but my mind is older

Gotta be my own man, like my father, but bolder
I shoulder his legacy with pride

I used to hear him say
That someday I wouldâ€”

ENSEMBLE:
Blow us all away!

PHILIP:
Ladies, Iâ€™m lookin for a Mr. George Eacker

Made a speech last week, our Fourth of July speaker
He disparaged my fatherâ€™s legacy in front of a crowd

I canâ€™t have that, Iâ€™m making my father proud

MARTHA:
I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks

He was goinâ€™ to see a play

PHILIP:
Well, Iâ€™ll go visit his box

DOLLY:
God, youâ€™re a fox

PHILIP:
And yâ€™all look pretty good in yaâ€™ frocks

How â€˜bout when I get back,
we all strip down to our socks?

BOTH:
Ok!

COMPANY:
Blow us all away!

PHILIP:
George!

GEORGE:
Shh

PHILIP:
George!

GEORGE:
Shh! Iâ€™m tryinâ€™ to watch the show!

PHILIP:
Yaâ€™ shoulda watched your mouth before you
Talked about my father though!

GEORGE:
I didnâ€™t say anything that wasnâ€™t true

You fatherâ€™s a scoundrel, and so, it seems, are you

ENSEMBLE:
Ooooooooooh!

PHILIP:
Itâ€™s like that?

GEORGE:
Yeah, I donâ€™t fool around
Iâ€™m not your little schoolboy friends

PHILIP:
See you on the dueling ground

That is, unless you wanna step outside and go now

GEORGE:
I know where to find you, piss off
Iâ€™m watchinâ€™ this show now

PHILIP:
Pops, if you had only heard

The shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about toâ€”

HAMILTON:
Slow down
The shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about toâ€”

HAMILTON:
Slow down

PHILIP:
I came to ask you for advice.
HAMILTON:
Slow down

PHILIP:
I came to ask you for advice.

This is my very first duel
They donâ€™t exactly cover this subject in boarding school

HAMILTON:
Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?

PHILIP:
He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease

HAMILTON:
Where is this happening?

PHILIP:
Across the river, in Jersey

HAMILTON/PHILIP:
Everything is legal in New Jerseyâ€¦

HAMILTON
Alright.

So this is what youâ€™re gonna do:
Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you

When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air
This will put an end to the whole affair

PHILIP:
But what if he decides to shoot? Then Iâ€™m a goner

HAMILTON:
No. Heâ€™ll follow suit if heâ€™s truly a man of honor

To take someoneâ€™s life, that is something you canâ€™t shake
Philip, your mother canâ€™t take another heartbreak

PHILIP:
Fatherâ€”

HAMILTON:
Promise me. You donâ€™t want this
Young manâ€™s blood on your conscience

PHILIP:
Okay, I promise

HAMILTON:
Come back home when youâ€™re done

Take my guns. Be smart. Make me proud, son

PHILIP:
My name is Philip

I am a poet
Iâ€™m a little nervous, but I canâ€™t show it

Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m a Hamilton with pride
You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide

Mister Eacker! How was the rest of your show?

GEORGE:
Iâ€™d rather skip the pleasantries

Letâ€™s go
Grab your pistol

PHILIP:
Confer with your men

The duel will commence after we count to ten

ENSEMBLE:
Count to ten!

PHILIP:
Look â€˜em in the eye, aim no higher

Summon all the courage you require
Then slowly and clearly aim your gun towards the skyâ€”

Mr. Hamilton, come in.

They brought him in a half an hour ago.
He lost a lot of blood on the way over.

HAMILTON:
Is he alive?
They brought him in a half an hour ago.
He lost a lot of blood on the way over.

HAMILTON:
Is he alive?

DOCTOR:
Yes. But you have to understand

The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

HAMILTON:
Can I see him please?
The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

HAMILTON:
Can I see him please?

DOCTOR:
Iâ€™m doing evâ€™rything I can

But the wound was
Already infected when he arrivedâ€”

Philip

PHILIP:
Pa

I did exactly as you said, Pa
I held my head up high

HAMILTON:
I know, I know.
Shh, I know, I know

Shh. I know you did
Evâ€™rything just right

Even before we got to ten

I was aiming for the sky

ANGELICA:
There are moments that the words donâ€™t reach

There is suffering too terrible to name

You hold your child as tight as you can
And push away the unimaginable

The moments when youâ€™re in so deep
It feels easier to just swim down

The Hamiltons move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable

HAMILTON:
I spend hours in the garden

I walk alone to the store
And itâ€™s quiet uptown

I never liked the quiet before

I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door

And I pray

That never used to happen before

WOMEN:
If you see him in the street

Walking by himself, talking to himself
Have pity

HAMILTON:
Philip, you would like it uptown

Itâ€™s quiet uptown

WOMEN:
He is working through the unimaginable

MEN:
His hair has gone grey.

He passes every day
They say he walks the length of the city

HAMILTON:
You knock me out, I fall apart

COMPANY:
Can you imagine?

HAMILTON:
Look at where we are

Look at where we started

I know I donâ€™t deserve you, Eliza
But hear me out

That would be enough

If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine

Heâ€™d be standing here right now
And you would smile

And that would be enough

I donâ€™t pretend to know
The challenges weâ€™re facing

I know thereâ€™s no replacing what weâ€™ve lost
And you need time

But Iâ€™m not afraid

I know who I married

Just let me stay here by your side

That would be enough

COMPANY:
If you see him in the street

Walking by her side, talking by her side
Have pity

HAMILTON:
Eliza, do you like it uptown?
Itâ€™s quiet uptown

COMPANY:
He is trying to do the unimaginable

See them walking in the park, long after dark
Taking in the sights of the city

HAMILTON:
Look around, look around, Eliza

COMPANY:
They are trying to do the unimaginable

ANGELICA:
There are moments that the words donâ€™t reach

There is a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we can never understand

We push away the unimaginable

They are standing in the garden
Alexander by Elizaâ€™s side

She takes his hand

ELIZA:
Itâ€™s quiet uptown

COMPANY:
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?

Forgiveness. Can you imagine?

If you see him in the street, walking by her
Side, talking by her side, have pity

They are going through the unimaginable

ENSEMBLE:
The Election of 1800!

JEFFERSON:
Can we get back to politics?

MADISON:
Please?

JEFFERSON:
Yo, every action has its equal opposite reaction

John Adams shat the bed
I love the guy, but heâ€™s in traction

Poor Alexander Hamilton, he is missing in action
So now Iâ€™m facing Aaron Burr with his own faction

MADISON:
Heâ€™s very attractive in the North
New Yorkers like his chances

JEFFERSON:
Heâ€™s not very forthcoming on any particular stances

MADISON:
Ask him a question, it glances off
He obfuscates, he dances

JEFFERSON:
And they say Iâ€™m a Francophile
At least they know I know where France is

MADISON:
Thomas, thatâ€™s the problem
See, they see Burr as a less extreme you

You need to change course
A key endorsement might redeem you

JEFFERSON:
Who did you have in mind?

MADISON:
Donâ€™t laugh

JEFFERSON:
Who is it?

MADISON:
You used to work on the same staff.

JEFFERSON:
Whaaaat?

MADISON:
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side
JEFFERSON:
Whaaaat?

MADISON:
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

JEFFERSON AND MADISON:
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

AARON BURR:
Talk less!

Smile more!

Don't let them know what you're against
Or what you're for!

Shake hands with him!

Charm her!

Itâ€™s 1800
Ladies, tell your husbands, vote for Burr!

VARIOUS ENSEMBLE:
I donâ€™t like Adams!

Well, heâ€™s gonna lose, thatâ€™s just defeatist.

And Jefferson? In love with France!

Yeah, heâ€™s so elitist!

I like that Aaron Burr!
I canâ€™t believe weâ€™re here with him!

He seems approachable?
Like you could grab a beer with him

ENSEMBLE:
Dear Mr. Hamilton

Your fellow Federalists
Would like to know how youâ€™ll be voting

HAMILTON:
Itâ€™s quiet uptownâ€¦

ENSEMBLE:
Dear Mr. Hamilton

John Adams doesnâ€™t stand a chance,
So who you are you promoting?

HAMILTON:
Itâ€™s quiet uptownâ€¦

Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
We know, itâ€™s lose/lose

Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
But if you had to chooseâ€¦

Dear Mr. Hamilton

John Adams doesnâ€™t stand a chance
So who you are you promoting?

But if you had to choose!

HAMILTON:
Well, if isnâ€™t Aaron Burr, sir.

BURR:
Alexander!

HAMILTON:
Youâ€™ve created quite a stir, sir.

BURR:
Iâ€™m going door to door!

HAMILTON:
Youâ€™re openly campaigning?

BURR:
Sure!

HAMILTON:
Thatâ€™s new.

BURR:
Honestly, itâ€™s kind of draining

HAMILTON:
Burr?

BURR:
Sir?

HAMILTON:
Is there anything you wouldnâ€™t do?

BURR:
No, Iâ€™m chasing what I want, and you know what?

HAMILTON:
What?

BURR:
I learned that from you

ENSEMBLE:
If you had to choose, if you had to chooseâ€¦

MADISON:
Itâ€™s a tie

ENSEMBLE:
If you had to choose, if you had to chooseâ€¦

JEFFERSON:
Itâ€™s up to the delegates

ENSEMBLE:
If you had to choose, if you had to chooseâ€¦

JEFFERSON AND MADISON:
Itâ€™s up to Hamilton!

ENSEMBLE:
If you had to choose, if you had to chooseâ€¦

Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
ENSEMBLE:
If you had to choose, if you had to chooseâ€¦

Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?

Choose, choose, choose!

HAMILTON:
Yo

The people are asking to hear my voice

But the country is facing a difficult choice

And you were to ask me who Iâ€™d promoteâ€¦

â€¦Jefferson has my vote

I have never agreed with Jefferson onceâ€¦

We have fought on like 75 different fronts

But when all said and all is doneâ€¦

Jefferson has beliefs; Burr has none

ENSEMBLE:
Ooooh!

JEFFERSON AND MADISON:
Well, Iâ€™ll be damned! Well, Iâ€™ll be damned!

MADISON:
Hamiltonâ€™s on your side

ENSEMBLE:
Well, Iâ€™ll be damned! Well, Iâ€™ll be damned!

MADISON:
Andâ€¦ you won in a landslide

BURR:
Congrats on a race well won

I did give you a fight.

JEFFERSON:
Uh-huhâ€¦

BURR:
I look forward to our partnership.

JEFFERSON:
Our partnership?

BURR:
As your vice president!

JEFFERSON:
Yeah, right!

You hear this guy?

Man openly campaigns against me
Talking â€˜bout â€œI look forward to our partnership!â€

MADISON:
It is crazy that the guy who comes in second
gets to be vice president

JEFFERSON:
Ooh! Yâ€™know what, we can change that!
Yâ€™know why?

MADISON:
Why?

JEFFERSON:
â€˜Cause Iâ€™m the president!

Burr, uhâ€¦

When you see Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement.

BURR:
How does Hamilton

An arrogant
Immigrant, orphan

Bastard, whoreson

Somehow endorse
Thomas Jefferson, his enemy

A man heâ€™s despised since the beginning
Just to keep me from winning?

I wanna be in the room where it happens

The room where it happens
The room where it happens

Youâ€™ve kept me from
The room where it happens

For the last time

Dear Alexander:

I am slow to anger
But I toe the line

As I reckon with the effects
Of your life on mine

I look back on where I failed
And in every place I checked

The only common thread has been your disrespect

Now you call me â€œamoral,â€
A â€œdangerous disgrace,â€

If youâ€™ve got something to say

Name a time and place
Face to face

I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant

A dot Burr

HAMILTON:
Mr. Vice President:

I am not the reason no one trusts you
No one knows what you believe

I will not equivocate on my opinion
I have always worn it on my sleeve

Even if I said what you think I said
You would need to cite a more specific grievance

Hereâ€™s an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements

BURR:
Sweet Jesus

HAMILTON:
Hey, I have not been shy

I am just a guy in the public eye
Tryinâ€™ to do my best for our republic

I donâ€™t wanna fight
But I wonâ€™t apologize for doing whatâ€™s right

I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant

A dot Ham

BURR:
Careful how you proceed, good man
Intemperate indeed, good man

Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or
Prepare to bleed, good man

HAMILTON:
Burr, your grievance is legitimate

I stand by what I said, every bit of it
You stand only for yourself

Itâ€™s what you do
I canâ€™t apologize because itâ€™s true

BURR:
Then stand, Alexander

Weehawken. Dawn
Guns. Drawn

HAMILTON:
Youâ€™re on

BURR AND HAMILTON:
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant

HAMILTON:
A dot Ham

BURR:
A dot Burr

ELIZA:
Alexander, come back to sleep

HAMILTON:
I have an early meeting out of town

ELIZA:
It's still dark outside

HAMILTON:
I know, I just need to write something down

ELIZA:
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

HAMILTON:
Shh

ELIZA:
Come back to bed, that would be enough

HAMILTON:
I'll be back before you know I'm gone

ELIZA:
Come back to sleep

This meeting's at dawn

Well I'm going back to sleep

My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as myâ€”

BURR AND COMPANY:

BURR:
Hamilton arrived with his crew:

Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew

COMPANY:
Number three!

BURR:
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain

I wish I could tell you what was happâ€™ning in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!

COMPANY:
Most disputes die and no one shoots!

Number four!

BURR:
Hamilton drew first position

Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksmanâ€™s ability

The doctor turned around so he could have deniability

COMPANY:
Five!

BURR:
Now I didnâ€™t know this at the time
But we wereâ€”

BURR, PHILIP AND HAMILTON:
Near the same spot
Your/My son died, is that why -

COMPANY:
Six!
BURR, PHILIP AND HAMILTON:
Near the same spot
Your/My son died, is that why -

COMPANY:
Six!

BURR:
He examined his gun with such rigor?

I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger

COMPANY:
Seven!

BURR:
Confession time? Hereâ€™s what I got:

My fellow soldiersâ€™ll tell you Iâ€™m a terrible shot

COMPANY:
Number eight!

MEN:
Your last chance to negotiate

Send in your seconds
See if they can set the record straight

BURR:
They wonâ€™t teach you this in your classes

But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses

Why? If not to take deadly aim?
Itâ€™s him or me, the world will never be the same

I had only one thought before the slaughter:
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter

COMPANY:
Number nine!

BURR:
Look him in the eye, aim no higher

Summon all the courage you require
Then count:

COMPANY:
One two three four five six seven eight nine

Number ten paces! Fire!â€”

HAMILTON:
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory

Is this where it gets me
On my feet, sevâ€™ral feet ahead of me?

I see it coming
Do I run or fire my gun or let it be?

There is no beat, no melody

Burr, my first friend, my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see

If I throw away my shot
Is this how youâ€™ll remember me?

What if this bullet is my legacy?

Legacy.

What is a legacy?

Itâ€™s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see

I wrote some notes
At the beginning of a song someone will sing for me

America, you great unfinished symphony
You sent for me, you let me make a difference

A place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up

Iâ€™m running out of time.
Iâ€™m running, and my timeâ€™s up

Wise up! Eyes up!

I catch a glimpse of the other side
Laurens leads a soldiersâ€™ chorus on the other side

My son is on the other side
Heâ€™s with my mother on the other side

Washington is watching from the other side
Teach me how to say goodbye

Rise up, rise up, rise up!

Eliza

My love, take your time

Iâ€™ll see you on the other side

Raise a glass to freedom...

BURR AND COMPANY:
He aims his pistol at the skyâ€”

BURR:
Wait!

I strike him right between his ribs

I walk towards him, but I am ushered away

They row him back across the Hudson

I get a drink

I hear wailing in the streets

Somebody tells me, â€œYouâ€™d better hide.â€

They say

BURR AND ANGELICA:
Angelica and Elizaâ€”

BURR:
Were both at his side when he died

Death doesnâ€™t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints

It takes and it takes and it takes

History obliterates
In every picture it paints

It paints me and all my mistakes

When Alexander aimed at the sky
He may have been the first one to die

But Iâ€™m the one who paid for it

I survived, but I paid for it

Now Iâ€™m the villain in your history

I was too young and blind to see...

I shouldâ€™ve known
I shouldâ€™ve known

The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me

The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me

WASHINGTON:
Let me tell you what I wish Iâ€™d known

When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control

Who lives, who dies
Who tells your story?

BURR:
President Jefferson:

JEFFERSON:
Iâ€™ll give him this

His financial system is a work of genius.
I couldnâ€™t undo it if I tried

And I tried

COMPANY:
Who lives, who dies
Who tells your story?

BURR:
President Madison:

MADISON:
He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity

I hate to admit it, but he doesnâ€™t get enough credit
For all the credit he gave us

COMPANY:
Who lives, who dies
Who tells your story?

ANGELICA:
Every other founding father's story gets told

Every other founding father gets to grow old

I raise funds in D.C. for the Washington Monument
