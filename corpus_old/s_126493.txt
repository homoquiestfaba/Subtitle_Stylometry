Locutus.

I am Locutus of Borg.
Resistance is futile.

Authorisation: Picard 47-AT.

Did I catch you at a bad time?
No, Admiral, of course not.

Ive just heard that our colony on
Ivor Prime has been destroyed.

Long-range sensors...
Yes, I know. The Borg.

Captain’s log: Stardate 50893.5.

The moment have dreaded for
nearly six years has finally arrived.

The Borg, our lethal enemy, have
begun an invasion of the Federation.

This time
there maybe no stopping them.

How many ships?
One, on a direct course for Earth.

They’ll be in Federation space soon.
Admiral Hayes is mobilising a fleet.

It will take us three hours...
We’re not going.

What do you mean?
We’re to patrol the Neutral Zone.

In case the Romulans decide
to take advantage of the situation.

There has been no unusual activity
along the Romulan border.

Does Starfleet feel
we need more shakedown time?

Were ready! The Enterprise E is
the most advanced ship in the fleet.

I have gone over all this
with Starfleet. Their orders stand.

Number One,
set a course for the Neutral Zone.

Bizet?
Berlioz. What do you have?

Weve finished
our first sweep of the Neutral Zone.

Fascinating.
20 particles of dust per cubic metre.

52 ultraviolet radiation spikes
and a class-two comet.

This is certainly
worthy of our attention.

Captain, why are we out here?

Starfleet has every confidence
in the Enterprise and her crew.

Theyre just not sure
about her captain.

A man once captured
and assimilated by the Borg -

should not be put in a situation
where he would face them again.

It would introduce an unstable element
to a critical situation.

Your experience makes you
the perfect man to lead this fight.

Bridge to Captain Picard.

Weve received word from the fleet,
theyvve engaged the Borg.

Mr Data, put Starfleet frequency 1486
on audio.

Flagship Endeavour,
stand by to engage.

Defiant and Bozeman,
fallback to mobile position one.

We have it in visual range.
A Borg cube on course 0215...

We are the Borg. Lower your shields
and surrender your ships.

We will add your biological
distinctiveness to our own.

Your culture will adapt to serve us.
Resistance is futile.

All units, open fire.

Theyve broken through
the defence perimeter.

Continue to attack.

We need reinforcements.

96 dead and 22 wounded
on the Lexington.

Lt Hawk, set a course for Earth.
Maximum warp.

I am about to disobey our orders.

Any of you who wish to object
should do so now.

I believe I speak for everyone here
when I say...

...to hell with our orders.

Red alert. All hands to battle stations.
Engage.

Report!
Power off-line, our weapons are gone.

Perhaps today is a good day to die.
Prepare for ramming speed.

Sir, theres another ship coming in.

Its the Enterprise.

The Defiant is losing life support.
Beam the survivors aboard.

Theyve destroyed the admiralss ship.

What is the status of the Borg cube?
The outer hull has been damaged.

I am reading fluctuations
in their power grid.

Number One,
open a channel to the fleet.

This is Capt Picard.
Im taking command of the fleet.

Plot in the following coordinates.
Fire on my command.

Is that a vital system?
Trust me, Data.

The fleet has responded, sir,
theyre standing by.

Fire.

Mr Hawk, pursuit course. Engage.
Aye, sir.

What?
I can hear them.

I have a patient here
who insists on coming to the bridge.

Welcome aboard, Mr Worf.
Thank you, sir.

The Defiant?
Adrift, but salvageable.

Tough little ship.
Little?

Mr Worf, we could use some help
at tactical.

You do remember
how to fire phasers?

Were detecting
chronometric particles.

Theyre creating a temporal vortex.
Time travel.

Data, report.
Were caught in a temporal wake.

Captain... Earth.

There are high concentrations
of methane and carbon monoxide.

Life signs?
Approximately nine billion.

All Borg.
How?.

They did it in the past. They went back
and assimilated Earth, changed history.

Why are we still here?

The temporal wake protected us
from changes in the time line.

The vortex is collapsing.
Hold your course.

We must follow them back
and repair the damage theyve done.

Come on.
Good night, Eddie.

Go home.

Youll regret this tomorrow.

You should have learned by now
that I dont have regrets.

One more round, Lily.
Z, youve had enough.

Im not flying with a drunken pilot.
I cantt fly sober.

What is that?

That is the constellation Leo.
No, that!

Its the ECON.
After all these years?

Weve got to get to the Phoenix.

To hell with the Phoenix.

Shields are down.
Main power is holding.

We are in the mid 21st century.

I would estimate we have arrived
ten years after the Third World War.

That makes sense. Most of the
major cities have been destroyed.

600 million dead. No resistance.
Captain.

Mr Worf, quantum torpedoes.
Fire.

They were firing at the surface.
Location?

Western hemisphere.
North American Continent.

A missile complex in Montana.
A missile complex?.

Data, I need to know the exact date.

April 4th, 2063.

April 4th.
The day before First Contact.

The missile complex must be
where Cochrane is building his ship.

They came to stop First Contact.

How much damage, Lieutenant?
I cant tell.

Well have to go down there
and find out what happened.

Have a security team ready.

Computer, 21st century clothing.

Number One, you have the Bridge.

Over here.

Theyre all dead.

See if one of them is Cochrane.
Data, lets go check the warp ship.

The structural integrity of the missile
appears to be intact.

The fuselage is slightly damaged.

We have the blueprints.
We need a team down here.

Hold your fire. Were here to help.
Bullshit!

Captain, I believe I can handle this.

Greetings.

This woman
requires medical attention.

Severe radiation poisoning.
From the damaged ship.

I have to get her to sick bay.

No lectures on the prime directive,
Ill keep her unconscious.

Tell Riker to beam down with
a search party to find Cochrane.

Crusher to Enterprise.
Two to beam directly to sick bay.

In 48 hours
this ship has to be launched.

Geordi, the ship was damaged in the
attack. Get a repair crew down here.

Im on my way. Alpha team,
werre heading down to the surface.

Porter, take command while Im gone.

Check out the environmental controls.
Its a little warm in here.

Isnt it amazing?

This ship
used to be a nuclear missile.

An historical irony. Using an
instrument of mass destruction -

to inaugurate an era of peace.

A boyhood fantasy. Ive seen
this ship in the Smithsonian, -

but I was never able to touch it.

Does tactile contact
alter your perception of the Phoenix?.

For humans, touch can connect you
to an object in a very personal way.

It makes it seem more real.

Im detecting imperfections
in the titanium casing.

Temperature variations
in the fuel manifold.

It is no more real to me now
than it was a moment ago.

Would you three like to be alone?
What have you found out?

Theres no sign of Cochrane.
He has to be here.

This ship and this flight
were his dream.

We should consider the possibility
that Dr Cochrane died in the attack.

If thats true...
then the future may die with him.

What do you think?.
The entire system has gone crazy.

Its affecting the entire deck.
Illl check the EPS conduits.

Hello? Hey!
Are you talking to me?

Is anyone else working up here?

Not that I know of.

Paul?

Paul, are you okay in there?

Captain, what is it?

Picard to Enterprise. Mr Worf,
is everything all right up there?

We are experiencing some
environmental diffiiculties.

Humidityhas risen 73%
and the temperature is up 10 degrees.

Mr Data and I will be right there.
Number One, take charge down here.

The damage to her cell membranes
is repaired. She should be fine.

Find out why its so hot in here.

Now what?
Crusher to Engineering.

Crusher to Bridge.

Exactly whats been happening?
Wevve lost contact with Deck 16.

I was about to send
a security team to investigate.

No, seal off Deck 16. Post
security teams at every access point.

What environmental conditions
were last reported in Engineering?

92% humidity.
39.1 degrees Celsius.

39.1 degrees Celsius...
like a Borg ship.

They knew their ship was doomed.
Our shields were down.

Somehow they transported over here
without being detected.

Theyll assimilate the Enterprise...
and then Earth.

Picard to Riker.

Enterprise to Away Team.

Respond.

Main control is being re-routed
through Engineering.

Data, lock out the main computer.

I have isolated the main computer
with an encryption code.

The Borg have cut primary power
to all decks except 16.

The Borg wont stay on Deck 16.

Youre all right. Come on, wake up.

You are all right. Listen to me.

Youre going to be fine.
I need you to do as I say.

Is the EMH programme on-line?
It should be.

Activate the EMH programme.
What is the nature of the emergency?.

20 Borg are about to break in here.
Create a diversion.

This isnt part of my programme.
Imm a doctor.

Do a dance, tell a story,
just give us a few seconds.

According to medical research, Borg
implants can cause skin irritations.

Perhaps youd like
an analgesic cream.

Which way?.

We need to get off this deck.
Follow me.

Engineering will be the central point
from which they control the hive.

If we begin firing in there,
we may hit the warp core.

Our goal should be to puncture
one of the plasma coolant tanks.

Plasma coolant will liquefy
organic material on contact.

The Borg cannot survive
without their organic components.

All weapons will be set
on a rotating modulation.

The Borg will adapt quickly.
Well be able to fire 12 shots at most.

You may encounter crew members
who have already been assimilated.

Dont hesitate to fire. Believe me,
youlll be doing them a favour. Let`sss go.

Deanna!

Deanna!

Will, dont turn off that..!

Who is this jerk?. And who told him
he could turn off my music?

Will Riker, Zefram Cochrane.

Is he a friend of yours?
Yes.

Husband?
No?

Good.

This, Deena...
Deanna.

This... is the good stuff.

Dr Cochrane...

To the Phoenix...
May she rest in peace.

Okay, that wasnt so good.

We have to tell him the truth.
Then the time line...

This is no time to argue about time.
We dont have the time.

What was I saying?
Youre drunk.

He wouldnt even talk to me
unless I had a drink with him.

It took three shots of tequila
just to find out his name.

Ive spent the last 20 minutes
trying to keep his hands off me.

So dont go criticising
my counselling techniques.

Its a primitive culture.

Im just trying to blend in.
He didntt believe our cover story.

Were running out of time.
Will he be able to handle the truth?

If youre looking for my
professional opinion... Hess nuts.

Ill be sure to note that in my log.

Captain, I believe Im feeling...
anxiety.

It is an intriguing sensation.

Data, perhaps you should deactivate
your emotion chip for now.

Good idea, sir... Done.

Data, there are times that I envy you.

Its only me! We have wounded here.

Get these people back to Deck 14.
There was a civilian with us.

Well watch for her.
Please, try to find her.

Lower your weapons. Theyll ignore
us till the consider us a threat.

The manual release.

Mr Worf, hold this position.

Manualrelease on-line.

Perhaps we should just knock.

Data.

Ready phasers.

Data, cover me.

Captain, they have adapted.

Regroup on Deck 15.
Dont let them touch you.

Captain!
Data!

Here!

Help!

Please, help.

You! How the hell..?
Back off!

Who are you?
What faction are you with?

Im not with the Eastern Coalition.
Just get me the hell out of here.

Now!
That isnt going to be easy.

Youd better find a way,
or Imm going to start pushing buttons.

Follow me.
Slow!

You wont be able to break
the encryption codes.

Nor will you
be able to assimilate me.

Brave words.
Ive heard them before.

From thousands ofspecies
across thousands ofworlds.

Butnow they are alIBorg.

I am unlike any life form
you have encountered before.

You are an imperfectbeing,
created by an imperfectbeing.

Findingyour weakness
is only a matter oftime.

Let me make sure I understand you
correctly, Commander.

A group of cybernetic creatures
from the future -

have travelled back through time
to enslave the human race.

And youre here to stop them?
Hot damn! Yourre heroic.

Were going to prove it to you.
There she is! Beautiful!

All right, take a look.
Well, well, well...

What have we got here?
I love a good peep show.

Thats a trick.
How did you do that?

Its your telescope.
Thatss our ship. The Enterprise.

And Lily is up there?
Can I talk to her?.

Weve lost contact with the ship.
We dontt know why yet.

So what is it you want me to do?
Conduct your flight as planned.

Why tomorrow morning?

At 11 oclock an alien ship
will be passing this solar system.

Alien? You mean extra-terrestrials?

More bad guys?
Good guys.

They have no interest in Earth...
too primitive.

When they discover that humans have
learned how to fly faster than light, -

they alter their course and make
first contact with Earth right here.

Here?
Actually, over there.

Its a pivotal moment in human history.
You make contact with an alien race.

After you do,
everything begins to change.

Fleets of starships are built
and mankind explores the galaxy.

It unites humanity when they realise
theyre not alone in the universe.

Poverty, disease and war
will all be gone in 50 years.

But unless you make that warp flight
tomorrow, none of it will happen.

You people are all astronauts...

...on some kind of star trek.

I know this is a lot to take in,
but were running out of time.

We need your help.
What do you say?.

Why not?

It looks pretty bad, sir.
They control decks 26 up to 11.

When they took Deck 11,
they stopped.

Theyve assimilated half the ship.
Why stop there?

What is on Deck 11?
Hydroponics. Deflector control.

They stopped there because
it gave them a tactical advantage.

Return to your checkpoints.

What happened in sick bay?.
Wheres Dr Crusher?.

Why did you break the cease-fire?
We didnt attack you.

Theres a new faction that
wants to prevent tomorrowss launch.

Were here to help you.
You are not in Montana anymore.

You are on a spaceship
orbiting the Earth.

Get me out of here.
All right.

You want a way out. Here it is.

What is this?

Australia. New Guinea.
The Solomons.

Montana will be up soon,
but its a long way down.

Im not your enemy
and I can get you home.

Put the weapon down and trust me.

Jean-Luc Picard.
Thats my name, whatss yours?

Lily.
Welcome aboard, Lily.

Thank you.

Maximum setting. If youd fired this,
youdd have vaporised me.

Its my first ray gun.

Theres no glass.
Forcefield.

Ive never seen such technology.
It hasntt been invented yet.

Theres more I have to tell you.
Come on.

Are you ready?

Who are you?
I am the Borg.

That is a contradiction. The Borg
have a collective consciousness.

There are no individuals.

I am the beginning, the end,
the one who is many.

I am the Borg.

Greetings.

I am curious,
do you control the Borg collective?

You imply disparity where
none exists. I am the collective.

Ill rephrase the question.
I wish to understand their hierarchy.

Are you their leader?.

I bring order to chaos.

A cryptic response.

You are in chaos, Data.

You are a machine
who wishes to be human.

I am programmed
to evolve and to better myself.

We, too, are on a quest
to better ourselves.

Evolving toward a state of perfection.

Forgive me, but the Borg
do not evolve, they conquer.

By assimilating other beings we are
bringing them closer to perfection.

Somehow I question your motives.

That is because you havent
been properly... stimulated yet.

You have reactivated
my emotion chip. Why?.

Dont be frightened.
I am not frightened.

Do you know what this is?
It would appear to be organic skin.

What a cold description
for such a beautiful gift.

Was that good for you?

How big is this Federation?
Over 150 planets.

They span 8,000 light years.
You mustnt get home much.

I tend to think of this ship as home.
I get back to Earth whenever I can.

They havent broken the code yet.
Who? The zombies?

The Borg.
It sounds Swedish.

How big is this ship?
24 decks. 700 metres long.

It took me six months to find enough
titanium just to build a cockpit.

How much did this thing cost?

The economics of the future
are somewhat different.

Money doesnt exist
in the 24th century.

No money?.
You mean you dont get paid?

The acquisition of wealth is no
longer the driving force in our lives.

We work to better ourselves...

...and the rest of humanity.

Actually, were rather like
yourself and Dr Cochrane.

All right!

Come on.
Is there another way around?

I know what Im doing.

Definitely not Swedish.

What the hell are you doing?

Perhaps something in satin.

Im sorry, but werre closing,
and we have a strict dress code.

If you boys dont leave...

Im looking for Nicky the Nose.
He hasntt been here in months.

This is the wrong chapter.

Computer, begin chapter 13.

Try and look
as if youre having a good time.

No, look at me.
Try to act naturally.

There he is.

Ruby, this is not a good time.
Its never the time for us, Dix.

Is that a case youre working on?
Illl see you later.

Okay, but watch your caboose
and dump the broad.

Look what the cat dragged in.
Whats shakin... Dix?.

The usual, martinis and skirts.
Excuse me.

Im going to take that personal.
No offence.

Hey!

I think you got him.

I dont get it. I thought
you said this was a hologram.

I disengaged the safety protocols,
so even a holographic bullet can kill.

What are you doing?
Looking for the neural processor.

Its like a memory chip.

It will contain a record of all the
instructions this Borg has received.

Its one of your uniforms.
Yes, this was Ensign Lynch.

Tough luck, huh?

Ive got to get to the bridge.

Doctor...
Yeah?

Would you take a look at this?
Yeah.

Ive constructed the intermix chamber
from what I remember in school.

You learned about this in school?
Yeah.

BBasic Warp Design````` is required
reading. You`rrre the first chapter.

Well, it looks like you got it right.

This is what were using to replace
the damaged plasma conduit.

Yes, but you need to reinforce
the tubing with a nano-polymer.

Dr Cochrane, I know this sounds
silly, but can I shake your hand?

Its such an honour to work with you.

I never imagined Id meet
the man who invented warp drive.

Im sorry... Thanks.

Do they have to keep doing that?
Its just a little hero worship.

I cant say I blame them.
We all grew up hearing about you.
