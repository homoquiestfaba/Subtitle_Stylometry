Addison Shepherd. OK,
could you try Montgomery-Shepherd?


Great. OK. Thank you. Bye.

Lose your wife?

You could say that.
What are you doing out of bed?

Did your mother like Addison
right off the bat?

Yeah, she liked Addison fine.

Right up until the sex
with my best friend part.

Uh-huh.

Well, I don't think
my mother likes Cristina.


My hand?
Mm-hmm.

Good. It's great, I'm fine.

You're cold calling hotels?

Four star hotels.
Thank God there's not that many of them.

Yes, I'll hold.

If you see Cristina, I...

Yeah, hi. Do you have a
Montgomery-Shepherd registered there?


Dr. Stevens...
How are you?

I'm good, Nurse Tyler.
How are you?

Good. Good.
I'm not crazy.

OK... then.

Ow.
He's trying to be nice.

Didn't feel very nice.
Do you need a break?

Maybe take a nap in the on-call room.

George.

Look, Callie.
Oh.

Hey, Callie.
Hey. You're back, that's good.

Yeah. Everything's all good.
Not back, just visiting, but good.

OK.
Hey, you know George really likes you.

Are you still mad at him?
I'm not mad at him, Izzie.

I would feel terrible if you were.
'Cause as good as I am right now,

I wasn't, really,
very OK the other night.

Gotta love a guy who'd
help his friend when he could be

spending the night in a hotel room
with a gorgeous woman.

Just stop. OK?
Just please stop.

She's a little bit of a martyr, huh?
Looking that way.

[Joe] Tequila. Double shot.
I didn't order this.

Joe!

Can we have some more peanuts?

What's this?
You had a hard day. Am I right?

Nancy, Derek.

I gotta go.
You can't go.

Didn't you get the memo
about the meeting?

What meeting?

Tonight is the very first meeting
of the Dirty Mistresses Club.

Thank you.

This is nice...

...having everyone together again.

Yeah.

Where's Cristina?

I think I want to be a general surgeon
just like she was.

How sick is that?

Burke proposed.

What?
I know, so George.

What did you say?

I told him I'd take it under advisement.

What does that mean?
I don't know.

I just can't say yes.

I can't say no, either.

I can't say yes.

Everything's different,
everyone's changing.

Getting married, proposed to,
opening clinics.

I'm just hovering.

I have to stop hovering.

I would kill to have
Ellis Grey as my mother.

Tell my mother
I signed the consent form.

You're doing the surgery in the morning.

I got a patient.
OK.

Come here.

Oh, come on.

I'm not hypothermic.

Then get out of these wet clothes
before you get hypothermic.

You're half frozen.

[breathing heavily]

Derek. I'm saying please.

Right.

You'll be pleased to hear

I'm proposing an expansion
to the hospital board this afternoon.

Give you quite a few
more places to hide.

I'm not going to hide,
I'm trying to find my resident.

I come to Seattle to see you,
you don't give me a moment.

Didn't come to see me,
you came to get a job.

I came for both!
You made a mistake.

Too busy wedding planning
for even coffee?

I'm not wedding planning,
I'm just trying to have a life,

and you, in your insidious way,
are trying to screw it up, so please.

Gonna invite me?
Where?

To the wedding.

How'd we start
talking about the wedding?

Brides love to talk about the wedding.
What's the matter?

Are we getting cold feet?

Please leave.

If he's rushing you,
you should tell him.

When you marry,
you want to be ready.

He should understand that.

Absolutely.
Of course he won't, men don't.

We're horrible egomaniacs,
every one of us.

You break off the engagement now
and his ego will never recover.

Oh, well good thing Burke's not you.

of rational thought.

Good. You keep thinking that
if you want to feel better.

You know how I
hate to see you unhappy.

Hold that there for a moment.

Getting paged 16 different directions
and I got lacs down here for days, so...

I need you to handle any non-facial
lacs. Save the faces for me.

Right.
OK.

'Cause God forbid anyone
survive a fiery boat crash

and have a scar to show for it.

Hey, Yang?
Yes, sir.

Congrats... on the upcoming nuptials.

What... What did you...

I'm sorry, where did you... Who are you?
Why would you think it's OK

to shout that across the hospital?
I didn't shout.

You don't know me, you're the new guy.

And you're the new guy
no one really wants around,

so whatever you heard,
it's none of your business.

Right.

I revoke my...
It's none of your business.

[water running]

[door opening]

Hey.
Hey.

You think you'll have to
keep her under long?

Well...

I believe once I relieve the tamponade,

she'll stabilize,
and I can get out pretty quickly.

Good, good. The quicker you get out,
the better the chances are for the baby.

Better both their chances.
[sighs]

Dr. Yang?

Your post-op and pre-op patients
are all in good shape,

so I'd like to scrub in.

Dr. Yang, I believe your orders
were to report to the pit.

[Addison clearing throat]

[clears throat]

Sloan knows.

I'm sorry?
Mark Sloan knows.

Everyone knows.
Everyone knows before Meredith knows

and that's on you,
so you owe me this.

Dr. Yang. Pit. Now.

emergent in the pit. I checked.

Dr. Yang.

Fine. I will go to the pit.

All this wedding fuss. You think
I don't know what you're up to?

Really, you surprise me. I thought this
kind of foolishness was beneath you.

I'm just trying to plan my wedding.
That's it.

It does this to people.
Not to you.

How would you know?
I never said yes to you.

Wait. No. Can you get this...
[Cristina] Ow!

Is it backwards?
OK, I think it's...

No. I think that maybe this hand
goes in the other sleeve.

[Cristina] Oh, oh.
Yeah.

Cristina, dear. Are you thinking
quarter or cathedral length veil?

This is the style of dress
I wore on my wedding day.

Oh...
OK, the zipper is caught

on the petticoat.
That's my hair! Ow!

[Meredith] Sorry.
Is everything all right?

Izzie.
OK, wait. Here they come.

Grab the skirt,
I'll hide under the layers of...

We're available
if you need another pair of hands.

OK! Oh, no... OK.

Choke me. Zip me up tighter
and then take this dress

and cut off my air so I'll faint
and put me out of my misery.

I think I just peed a little.

Just pee on the dress,
pee on the dress.

Iz. Izzie. Can you go
deal with the moms?

Um... What do I say?

OK, you take the dress,
I'll take the moms.

joking. My hair. It's in my hair.

OK, I'm sorry.
Hey...

Do you guys have a tissue?

A tissue? Don't tell me
you got makeup on that dress.

Oh, no, no, no, it's Cristina.
She's... She's a little overcome.

I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
Overcome?

Yeah, you know.
She's a bride and brides cry sometimes.

Cristina overcome?
She... She really loves your son.

Oh.
Thank you.

Oh, and if you could give us a few.
Doesn't want you to see her like this.

Cristina overcome?
Mm-hmm.

OK, here.
I bought us at least five minutes.

Just, you know...

Oh, you're my hero.

Wow. That's just so...

I hate this so much
...hideously ugly.

[all laughing]

That your toast?
Yeah.

Keep it clean.
Dirty never plays.

Are we almost at the end
of the best man advice?

Because I have to tell you,

considering the source
it's hard for me to take it seriously.

I'm your best man, Derek.
Always have been.

What's that supposed to mean?

In college, we'd go out together,
I'd be talking to a girl,

you'd be standing there like an idiot.

And at the end of the night, she
wants to know who my quiet friend is.

Hmm.
Assumes you're deep.

I choose plastics
and suddenly I'm superficial

compared to Derek Shepherd,
the great brain surgeon.

And sleeping with Addison?

You wanna be honest about it, Derek...

That's the best thing
I ever did for you.

Oh, come on.
You had a lousy marriage.

Suddenly, it's not your fault.

You know what the
best man's job is?

No.
Make the groom look good.

You made a career out of looking good
in comparison to me.

It's too long. Short and sweet, Derek.
Always leave 'em wanting more.
