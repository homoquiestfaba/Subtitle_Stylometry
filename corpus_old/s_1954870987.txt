<i> THEY SAY HAVING</i>
    <i> A SISTER IS LIKE HAVING</i>

         <i> A BEST FRIEND</i>
     <i> YOU CAN'T GET RID OF.</i>

   <i> YOU KNOW, WHATEVER YOU DO</i>
    <i> THEY'LL STILL BE THERE.</i>

<i> WELL THAT WAS NEVER OUR STORY.</i>

    <i> OUR STORY IS ABOUT HOW</i>
 <i> SISTERS CAN SINK EACH OTHER--</i>
    <i> REALLY SINK EACH OTHER.</i>

        MORNING, MARTHA.

           HI, ERIC.

      - THAT YOUR SISTER?
      - OH, YEAH, SURE IS.

              HI.

        SMELLS LIKE PISS
           BACK HERE.

         WOW. I THOUGHT
    YOUR SISTER WAS KIDDING

         WHEN SHE SAID
     YOU WERE A BUZZ KILL.

            SHANNON?
      HEY, SHANNON! SHAN!

            SHANNON!

     GREAT. NOW WE'RE GOING
      TO HAVE TO CLEAN UP
         AFTER A BUNCH

       OF SWEATY LEZZIES.

          GOD, WHAT IS
        WITH YOU TODAY?

    WHY DID YOU HAVE TO TELL
   THAT GUY I'M A BUZZ KILL?

  OH MY GOD! SHANNON JACKSON?

            - WHAT?
      - IT'S ME! KRISTEN!

   I WORK AT THE FRONT DESK.

             OKAY.

         YOU REMEMBER,
         KRISTEN METZ?

        WOW, OH MY GOD.

     YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

          NO? KRISTEN?

     REMEMBER, I WAS, LIKE,

      "AH! MY ANKLE! OW!"

         DID I KICK YOU
         IN THE ANKLE?

THEN I WAS LIKE "SIGN MY CAST!"

   AND THEN-- YOU COULDN'T--

       YOU DIDN'T DO IT,
  BUT, GOD, I KNEW IT WAS YOU!

         ARE WE TALKING
       ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL?

             - YES.
    - OKAY, I REMEMBER YOU.

          OKAY, GREAT.

  AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

      I THOUGHT YOU WERE,

     LIKE, TEACHING AT THAT
     FANCY PANTS SCHOOL IN
       CARMEL BY THE SEA?

      YEAH, I WAS BUT THEN

       I GOT FIRED 'CAUSE
  I FUCKED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE.

             - OH.
            - YEAH.

             WOOPS.

    JANITOR, LACROSSE COACH,
          COUPLE SUBS,

        THE HEADMASTER--
    THAT WAS MY BIG MISTAKE

    ACTUALLY BECAUSE WE GOT
      CAUGHT BY SOME KIDS

      UNDER THE BLEACHERS
         AT HOMECOMING.

              OH.

           SO NOW I'M
   A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER.

              YAY!

             YEAH.

 OH, YOU CAN'T CLEAN ANY ROOMS
       WITH KIDS IN THEM.

    BUT THAT'S FINE. THEY'RE
  ALWAYS REALLY DIRTY ANYWAY.

    OH, BY THE WAY, I SUCKED
    YOUR BOYFRIEND'S DICK AT

   CHRIS DELUCA'S PROM PARTY.

I'M SORRY?

     YEAH. I THINK HE MUST
     ATE A LOT OF PINEAPPLE

  BECAUSE HIS SPUNK IS TASTY.

       YOU GUYS MARRIED?
       IS IT SCOTT METZ?

   SO I GUESS WE MAY AS WELL
      JUST JUMP IN, RIGHT?

     GET STARTED, BASICALLY

   YOU JUST GET YOUR KEY OUT
      OF LANYARD LIKE THAT

       AND THEN YOU KNOCK
       THREE TIMES, YEAH?

       AND THEN YOU SAY--

FUCK OFF! I'M SLEEPING!

  OKAY, LET'S NOT GO IN THERE.

  UGH. PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTING.

          CHECK THIS.
     THIS IS HOW YOU PUT ON
       A NEW PILLOW CASE.

      THEN WHAT YOU DO IS
   THE DOUBLE-FOLD MANEUVER.

    THIS IS ALSO REALLY NICE

    TO DO IN YOUR OWN HOME,
      AND THEN LIKE THAT,
         FLUFF, FLUFF.

        PERFECT P-CASE.

      WHY ARE YOU CHANGING
       THE PILLOW CASES?

     IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE.
   THEY'RE NOT CHECKING OUT.

  OKAY, HOW ABOUT WE JUST TRY
       TO KEEP THIS JOB,

   SHAN, AND NOT BE SO LAZY?

             FINE.

 WHAT DO I DO WITH THEIR SHIT?
     DO I HAVE TO FOLD IT?

      OKAY, IF I RAPED YOU
  RIGHT NOW WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

      I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
      THIS GAME RIGHT NOW.

    YOU NEVER WANT TO PLAY.

         YEAH, I KNOW,
  THAT'S WHY I'M NOT PLAYING.

  THIS WAS A STUPID GAME WHEN
 WE WERE KIDS AND IT STILL IS.

         HEY, REMEMBER
   THAT OLD FRENCH PRESIDENT

WHO ATTACKED THAT AFRICAN MAID?

     HE WAS LIKE A GRANDPA
      AND SHE STILL HAD TO
         SPIT HIS JIZZ.

         WELL, I'M NOT
    SPITTING ANYONE'S JIZZ.

      OKAY, IF I RAPED YOU
      RIGHT NOW WHAT WOULD
            YOU DO?

       NO ONE'S RAPING ME
        IN THIS UNIFORM.

   IT'S NOT REALLY MY COLOR.

 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN A RAPE
   SITUATION IS YELL, "FIRE!"

   WHY WOULDN'T I YELL RAPE?

    NO ONE RESPONDS TO THAT.

     WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS?

      SO BASICALLY YOU PUT
      YOUR LAUNDRY INSIDE
           THE UNIT.

 AND THEN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

       YOU HAVE FULL LOAD
 BEFORE YOU START THE MACHINE.

          HEY, MARTHA.

          HEY, JERRY.
     HOW WAS YOUR VACATION?

     DOLLYWOOD WAS AWESOME.

      YOU MUST BE SHANNON.

     WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

        YOUR SISTER SAID
  THAT YOU'RE A GREAT SISTER.

      I'VE GOT MY BUCKET.

   AND THEN WHEN THAT'S DONE
  YOU CAN JUST MOVE OVER AND,

     YOU KNOW, CLOSE IT UP.

           HIT START.

     THEN ONCE THAT'S GOING
     YOU CAN MOVE OVER HERE

    AND START FOLDING STUFF.

          WHO IS THAT?

      WHO? JERRY? OH, HE'S
      THE EXECUTIVE MAID.

        HE'S WORKED HERE
       FOR LIKE 15 YEARS.

      SO HE'S THE TOP DOG.

YOU'RE KIDDING. THAT'S OUR BOSS?

           GOD, SHAN.

     WHAT? I'M JUST SAYING.

    DON'T BE SO INSENSITIVE.

  YOU'RE LUCKY THAT HE THINKS
SEX OFFENDERS FIGHT SEX CRIMES.

       YOU KNOW THIS SPOT
     IS REALLY COMPETITIVE.

       YOU WANT TO GO GET
      SOME HUMP DAY DRINKS

  TO CELEBRATE YOUR FIRST DAY?

          NOT REALLY.

            COME ON.
     WHO'S A BETTER DANCER?

       ME OR JODIE FOSTER
       IN "THE ACCUSED?"

      THAT'S NOT A CONTEST
        YOU WANT TO WIN.

       I LIKE THIS PLACE
      'CAUSE OF THE MUSIC.

         THAT'S GREAT.

         AND THE GIRLS.

     I'M SO GLAD YOUR BACK.

WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ABOUT
  THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF REHAB?

            I'M NOT.

   REHAB IS REHAB, YOU KNOW?

IT'S MY RECOVERY. IT'S PRIVATE.
         IT'S MY THING.

     WELL HOW DO YOU THINK
     YOU'RE DOING, THOUGH?

  DO YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER?

         I DON'T KNOW.

          I FEEL NUMB.

          WELL, HEY,
       AT LEAST NUMBNESS
      IS A FEELING, RIGHT?

          TO NUMBNESS.

         WHAT WAS THAT?

         WHAT WAS WHAT?

          THAT, SHAN.
     THAT DIDN'T SEEM NUMB.

      I'M ALLOWED TO LOOK
     AT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.

     HOW'S THAT FREELOADING
     WEIRDO YOU'RE DATING?

         WHO? ALICIA?
      SHE'S NOT A WEIRDO.

     MAYBE YOU'RE THINKING
      ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE.

      I THINK I'M THINKING
           OF ALICIA.

       UM, I DON'T KNOW.

SHE'S JUST GOING THROUGH A HARD
TIME RIGHT NOW, SO WE SPLIT UP.

      SHE WANTED TO LIKE--

        SUCK SOME DICKS?

    NO, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO--
         STOP, SHANNON.

  SHE'S A LOSER STRAIGHT GIRL

      WHO WAS NEVER GOING
    TO SETTLE DOWN WITH YOU.

     I LIKE HELPING PEOPLE.

 YEAH, YOU KNOW, WHO ELSE DID?

      MOM, AND IT LEFT HER
  WITH TWO TITS FULL OF CANCER

         SO ENJOY THAT.

        I'M GONNA GO PAY
        FOR THESE BEERS.

           AS USUAL.

HEY, SHAN,
    YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
     TO GO WITH ME, RIGHT?

       I HAVE A MEETING.

      YOU WANT SOME FIDDLE
        FOR YOUR PADDLE?

     NO, I'M GOOD. I'LL GET
     SOMETHING ON THE WAY.

        OKAY, IF YOU GET
   HUNGRY THERE'S SOME STUFF
        IN THE FREEZER.

      THERE'S BAGEL BITES,
     THREE CHEESE, CHEESE,
     SAUSAGE AND PEPPERONI.

     STOP TREATING ME LIKE
            I'M DAD.

        WELL, YOU KNOW,
         SOMEONE HAD TO
       TAKE CARE OF HIM.

LOOK, IF YOU WANT SOMETHING ELSE

         THERE'S PB & J
    OR GRILLED CHEESE STUFF.

     I'VE BEEN HERE A WEEK.

    I KNOW MY FOOD OPTIONS.

       JUST GO TO CLASS.

     AND THERE'S PINEAPPLE
       AND COUNTRY CROCK.

      ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
       GOING TO BE OKAY?

             YEAH.

      PROMISE YOU'RE GOING
    TO EAT SOMETHING, RIGHT,

       - NOT JUST SMOKE?
            - YEAH.

             OKAY.

        I'LL SEE YOU IN
       A COUPLE OF HOURS.

     HAVE A GREAT MEETING.

 HEY, SHAN, I JUST WANT TO SAY
        THAT, YOU KNOW,

     I'M HELLA PROUD OF YOU

      THAT YOU'RE GETTING
    YOUR LIFE BACK TOGETHER.

I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT.

       I MEAN LOOK AT ME.

         THANKS, DUMMY.

         OKAY, SEE YOU,
    WOULDN'T WANT TO BE YOU.

        I DON'T MEAN IT.

I'LL BE BACK, THE TERMINATOR.

I'LL BE BACK.

  LIKE, I'M GOING TO COME BACK
         AFTER THE GYM.

             - HEY.
             - HEY.

      THANKS FOR THE TEXT
     BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
    TO CALL, NOT COME OVER.

              OH.

          SORRY, WELL,
  I'M HERE NOW SO COME ON OUT.

        LET'S FUCK LIKE
        HORNY TEENAGERS.

            COME ON.
            COME ON.

             UH...

       YEAH, NO. I CAN'T
        BECAUSE I FORGOT
    TONIGHT WAS DATE NIGHT.

      JULIE IS COMING HOME
    AND WE'RE GOING TO PLAY
          "SCRABBLE."

           WHAT? GOD.

       - YOUR WIFE SUCKS.
        - YEAH, I KNOW.

   EVERYTHING BUT YOUR DICK.

           I STAYED
       IN THAT HOTEL ROOM
         FOR TWO WEEKS

   SO THAT MY SISTER WOULDN'T
     KNOW I GOT KICKED OUT

       OF REHAB FOR YOU.

             YEAH,
     I'M THE ONE WHO FORGED
       THE RELEASE PAPERS

     SO THE COURT WOULDN'T
     BE ALL OVER YOUR ASS.

        IT WAS THE LEAST
         YOU COULD DO.

        I'M PRETTY SURE
   THERAPISTS AREN'T SUPPOSED

 TO FUCK THEIR REHAB PATIENTS.

   THERAPISTS ARE SCREWED UP
 PEOPLE. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

       YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
      SHARON STONED ME IN
     THE OFFICE, REMEMBER?

         - THAT'S HOT.
       - IT WAS VERY HOT.

        "BASIC INSTINCT"
        IS A GREAT MOVIE.

          BUT I CAN'T.

    YOU SAID WHEN I GET BACK
        TO MY SISTER'S,

          WE'D BE BACK
     ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE.

      I NEED TO GET LAID.

           YOU KNOW,
   I THINK AS YOUR THERAPIST

     YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO
  TO A MEETING TONIGHT, OKAY?

            I'M WET.

       FINE, MEETINGS ARE
   GREAT PLACES TO GET LAID.

      OKAY, I CAN FUCK YOU
           IN THE CAR

     BUT I HAVE 10 MINUTES
    AND THAT'S IT. LET'S GO.

        FROM YOUR HIPS.
        FROM YOUR HIPS.

      WATCH YOUR FOOTWORK.

     I PROMISE I WON'T MAKE
          YOU DO MORE.

          OKAY. UM...

             OKAY.

           KRAV MAGA.
WE HAVE ONE RULE, ONE RULE ONLY.

      NEVER STOP FIGHTING!

            - HIYA!
            - HIYA!

THANK YOU.

       I'M HERE MONDAYS,

      WEDNESDAYS, FRIDAYS
     AT 8:00 P.M., WEEKENDS
       I'M HERE AT NOON.

      THE REST OF THE TIME

  I'M STUDYING TO BECOME A NUN
      SO DON'T BOTHER ME.

            - HELLO.
   - HEY, KELLY. GREAT CLASS.

    AMAZING FOCUS TONIGHT.
            REALLY.

 I'M TOTALLY RETHINKING MY PLAN
  OF KNIFING YOU IN AN ALLEY.

         I DIDN'T KNOW
       YOU HAD THAT PLAN.

       HEY HAVE YOU SEEN
         ALICIA AROUND?

         I JUST THOUGHT
      THAT I WOULD SEE HER

       'CAUSE SHE USUALLY
      WORKS OUT AT NIGHT.

   I MEAN, THANK GOD I DIDN'T
       'CAUSE IT'S JUST--

      IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE,
           YOU KNOW,

       SHE CAN'T WORK OUT
        IN THE MORNING.

    AND SHE DOESN'T GET DOWN
    WITH HER PARALEGAL STUFF

        UNTIL LIKE 7:00.

     AND THEN SHE CAN ONLY
        REALLY WORK OUT
     BETWEEN 7:30 AND 8:30

    BECAUSE SHE HAS TO WATCH
    "THE GOOD WIFE" AT 9:00.

      AND SHE'S NOT HERE.

      I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

      I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
         TELL YOU THIS

       BUT I REALLY THINK
       I PULLED SOMETHING

       LIKE, I MEAN GLUTS
          BACK THERE.

   I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
   HAD THOSE BEERS PRE-CLASS.

          THAT'S OKAY.

   WHY DON'T WE GO SOMEWHERE
   AND CONTINUE HAVING BEERS?

  AND THEN GET SOME THAI FOOD
         OR SOMETHING.

    DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

          I LOVE THAI.

       IT'S JUST IT SUCKS
  BECAUSE I CAN'T TONIGHT SO,

  YOU KNOW, MY SISTER IS BACK

  AND I JUST-- I DON'T WANT TO
 LEAVE HER HOME ALONE TOO LONG.

      SHE'S STILL FRAGILE.

          OKAY, COOL.

      I MEAN NOT COOL THAT
        SHE'S FRAGILE OR
     WHATEVER. I'M SORRY--

      WHAT'S UP, SHORTIES?

             WHAT?

       I WAS JUST TRYING
    TO MAKE SOME SMALL TALK.

              BYE.

              BYE.

      TODAY WE'RE TALKING
   ABOUT OUR BOTTOMS, SO P.S.
          ON THE TOPS.

  WATCH THE TRIGGER MATERIAL,
            PLEASE.

         SORRY, DENISE.

TALKING ABOUT OUR ROCK BOTTOMS.

          I WAS LIVING
     A PRETTY AWESOME LIFE.

  I WORKED AT "THE OPRAH SHOW"
          IN CHICAGO.

   I STARTED AS AN ASSISTANT,

        WORKED MY WAY UP
     TO ASSOCIATE PRODUCER.

  I WAS MAKING A LOT OF MONEY.

 AND I WAS DOING A LOT OF BLOW,
      LIKE, A LOT OF BLOW.

   AND YOU KNOW HOW BLOW IS.
      IT'S VERY SLIMMING.

   I HAD LIKE ABS TO MY NECK.

    I LOOKED LIKE A FUCKING
 PAKISTANI MARK-PAUL GOSSELAAR.

       THAT'S ZACK MORRIS
   FROM "SAVED BY THE BELL."

  EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT.

    I HAD THAT SHIT ON LOCK,
        OR SO I THOUGHT.

     CUT TO TWO YEARS LATER

    AND I WAKE UP COMPLETELY
     NAKED IN AN ABANDONED
       CONSTRUCTION SITE

   OUTSIDE OF WRIGLEY FIELD.

      HOW DID I GET THERE?

         I DON'T KNOW.
  I DON'T EVEN LIKE BASEBALL.

        ANYWAY WHEN I...

         DID MAKE IT TO
  WORK THAT DAY, I GOT FIRED.

     OPRAH WAS VERY STRICT
          ABOUT THAT.

   I WAS THIS CLOSE TO OPRAH,
     LITERALLY THIS CLOSE.

  SHE WOULD WALK RIGHT BY ME.

    AND I THREW IT ALL AWAY
      FOR DRUGS AND DICK--

    MEDIOCRE, MEDIOCRE DICK.

   PRETTY GOOD DRUGS THOUGH.

           THANK YOU.

    I DON'T, LIKE, CONSIDER
     LOSING A JOB A BOTTOM.

    IT WASN'T JUST ANY JOB.

IT WAS A JOB WITH OPRAH WINFREY.

 WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT OPRAH?

            AMERICA.

         SHE'S A BITCH.

SHAN, THE SMOG INDEX
            IS AT 2.

   IT'S A GREAT DAY. GET UP.

           HEY, SHAN,

I LAID OUT YOUR UNIFORM AND THE
SHOWER'S HOT AND READY FOR YOU.

I'M GOING TO MAKE US BREAKFAST.

             OKAY.

YOU NEED TO GET UP.

          I HEARD YOU.

I'M EMPLOYEE
    OF THE MONTH SO I DON'T
        WANT TO BE LATE.

       I KNOW YOU DON'T.

  YOU SHOULDN'T EAT THAT CRAP.

     YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
    EDGY ALL MORNING, SHAN.

 I THOUGHT THOSE MEETINGS WERE
SUPPOSED TO HELP MELLOW YOU OUT.

      IT'S CALLED PROGRESS
        NOT PERFECTION.

       AND I DON'T CHANGE
     THE FACT THAT I STILL
    LIVE IN THIS SHIT BOWL.

HEY, IF YOU HATE FRESNO SO MUCH
     WHY DID YOU COME BACK?

     OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE I'VE
     MADE A SERIES OF POOR
        LIFE DECISIONS.

LOOK, POSITIVE THINKING
    MEANS POSITIVE RESULTS.

       HEY, I OWN A HOME.
   THAT'S MY AMERICAN DREAM.

      LOCATION, LOCATION,
           LOCATION.

          HEY, NANCY.

         WE'RE ACTUALLY
          GOING DOWN.

           OH, YEAH?

  I'LL TAKE THE RIDE WITH YOU.

        YOU'RE NEW HERE.

   I KNOW EVERYONE WHO WORKS
      IN THE HOTEL. SO...

        HOW DO YOU LIKE
        THE JOB SO FAR?

         I CLEAN ROOMS.
  HOW DO YOU THINK I LIKE IT?

             RIGHT.

      ENJOY YOUR BURRITO.

   HAVE A GREAT DAY, LADIES.

  I HATE THAT GUY. HE'S ALWAYS
     HERE WITH PROSTITUTES.

  PROSTITUTES HAVE TO EAT TOO.

       WELL, HE'S GROSS.

           HE'S FINE.
    DON'T BE SO JUDGMENTAL.

 WE'RE STILL NOT CLEANING 400.

HIS ROOM SMELLS LIKE BURNT HAIR
   AND HE REUSES OLD CONDOMS.

       NOBODY DOES THAT.

            HE DOES.

            - SHAN.
            - WHAT?

       HE HANGS THEM OVER
      THE SHOWER ROD LIKE
         WIENER COZIES.

       WELL, THAT'S FOUL.

       I APPRECIATE YOUR
      CREATIVITY RIGHT NOW

 BUT THIS ISN'T AN ART PROJECT.
  THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL JOB.

 YOU TOLD ME TO STOCK MY CART.

     I AM STOCKING MY CART.

     YOU'RE OVER-STOCKING.

        THAT IS WAY TOO
       MUCH TOILET PAPER.

        NO ONE IS GOING
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM THAT MUCH.

    UM, YOU KNOW, I'LL TAKE
       ROOMS 403 TO 408.

        WELL, ALL RIGHT.

   ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GOING
    TO BE FINE ON YOUR OWN?

         I THINK I CAN
      CLEAN PUBES OFF SOAP
           BY MYSELF.

           THANK YOU.

     HEY, DID YOU GET THAT
      PICTURE I SENT YOU?

          YES, I DID.
     YOU LOOK VERY HEALTHY.

  YOU LOOK VERY WELL HYDRATED.

 I JUST POSTED IT ON INSTAGRAM.

  I HAVE 10,000 NEW FOLLOWERS.

         LISTEN, I HAVE
      SOME VERY BIG NEWS.

          WHAT IS IT?

    I GAVE JULIE THE LETTER.

        I'M FINALLY OUT,
       LIKE, REALLY OUT.

           WAIT, WHY?
        WHAT DID YOU DO?

     I GAVE HER THE LETTER.
     I TOLD HER EVERYTHING.

             <i> WHAT?</i>

    YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T THINK
     I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE

 TO DO IT BUT I SAW THE MOMENT.

  IT SORT OF PRESENTED ITSELF,
 AND THEN I WAS PRESENT FOR IT.

 AND IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED.

 <i> SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT VERY WELL.</i>

         BUT, YOU KNOW,
 THAT'S GOING TO BE HER THING.

  I WANT TO BE A REAL COUPLE,
             OKAY?

I WANT TO GO TO MOVIES WITH YOU

   AND SIT AT THE SAME TABLE
         IN RESTAURANTS

      AND NOT HAVE TO FUCK
          IN THE BUSH.

      - WHAT DO YOU THINK?
    - WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

 WELL, BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME THAT
YOU WANTED ME TO LEAVE MY WIFE.

    YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T THINK
     YOU'D ACTUALLY DO IT.

      GOD! WHO DOES THAT?
            GO BACK.

     WELL, I CAN'T GO BACK.
   I JUST TOLD HER AND I'D--

        GO BACK, EDWIN.

      SHANNON, I LOVE YOU,
           ALL RIGHT?

          I'M IN THIS.
   YOU'RE IN THIS TOO, RIGHT?

  LOOK, I CAN'T TAKE THIS KIND
     OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW.

     HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN
        YOU CAN'T TAKE--

     <i> I'M NOT WHAT-- WHAT?</i>

     HEY, CAN YOU COME BACK
             IN 10?

      DO YOU WANT TO FUCK?

          HEY, ALICIA,
      IT'S MARTHA CALLING.

       I WAS JUST CALLING

    BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE YOU
     AT THE GYM LAST NIGHT

         AND THAT MAKES
       ME REALLY WORRIED.

       YOU CALL ME CHAMP,

   AND I'LL FUCK YOU SO HARD
   YOU'LL COME OUT YOUR BUTT.

 I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID

  AND I TOLD HER THAT YOU CAN
 ONLY STAY FOR TWO MORE WEEKS.

 I MEAN, I HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET
BUT I'M GOING TO TELL HER, SO...

  BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT
       TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

      GO-- GO TO THE BED.

  UH, I MEAN, I KNOW YOU SAID
    YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TALK.

 SO, IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT, OKAY?

       SO, I DON'T KNOW,

MAYBE WE CAN HANG OUT AGAIN SOON
          OR SOMETHING

  OR JUST CALL ME OR TEXT ME.

          - GET DOWN.
            - OKAY.

             YEAH.

         GONNA GET IT.

           OKAY, BYE.

            SHANNON?

            SHANNON?

         HOUSEKEEPING.

       FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!

    WHAT THE? WHAT THE FUCK?

            - FIRE!
   - GET OFF--GET OFF OF HER.

             SHAN!

        YOU WERE RIGHT.

          - TAG TEAM!
   - GET AWAY FROM MY LITTLE
            SISTER!

   YOU STILL HAVE YOUR PUSSY,
             BABY.

     JUMP BACK ON MY DICK.

YOU'RE A DISGUSTING
         PIECE OF SHIT.

             SHAN!

       NO, NO, NO, SHAN.

  GOD, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

    WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING?
      WHAT THE FUCK, SHAN?

             - GOD.
            - OKAY.

         - OH, MY GOD.
         - OKAY. OKAY.

      OKAY. OKAY. SHANNON.

  IS HE DEAD? HOLY SHIT, SHIT.

       HE'S DEAD SHANNON.

    DID I JUST KILL SOMEONE?

  I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING, SHAN.

DID I JUST FUCKING KILL SOMEONE?

         CALM, BE CALM.

         - OH, MY GOD.
 - OKAY. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

     WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
    WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

   HE WAS RAPING YOU, RIGHT?

             - YES.
        - RIGHT? RAPING?

           100% RAPE.

       THAT'S WAS A RAPE.

         HE WAS RAPING
      THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

 OKAY, THEN HE WAS RAPING YOU.

   WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT?
  MARTHA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
        DON'T YOU PUT--

 - I'M GOING TO THE FRONT DESK.
         - DON'T EVEN--

FRONT DESK.

     WHAT? ARE YOU CALLING
        THE FRONT DESK?

        I'M TELLING THEM
         WHAT HAPPENED.

        NO, YOU'RE NOT.

             HELLO?

            - HELLO?
WE CAN BLAME THIS ON OUR BOSS.

            - JERRY?
  - YEAH, HE WOULD LOVE JAIL.

     IT'S VERY STRUCTURED.

       HE'D MAKE FRIENDS.

             HELLO?

      DO YOU WANT ME TO GO
            TO JAIL?

       NO, OF COURSE NOT.

 IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? 'CAUSE
   LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
            MARTHA.

       I AM A REGISTERED
         SEX OFFENDER.

    DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

      HOW DO I PROVE THAT
          HE RAPED ME?

       I NEED YOUR HELP.

             FINE.

  WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

EXCUSE ME.

   YEAH, I GOT A PHONE CALL.
  IS EVERYTHING OKAY IN THERE?

             HELLO?

     HELLO? THIS IS KRISTEN
      FROM THE FRONT DESK.

  IS EVERYTHING OKAY IN THERE?

    CAN YOU OPEN UP, PLEASE?

         BY LAW I NEED
   TO CHECK WHAT IS GOING ON.

CAN I HELP YOU?

           LET ME IN.
   WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

  NOTHING. I'M JUST CLEANING.

    OH REALLY? 'CAUSE I GOT
        A STRANGE CALL.

    IT SOUNDED LIKE A FIGHT
         OR SOMETHING.

      NO, I'M JUST REALLY
      INTENSELY CLEANING.

   IT'S REALLY DIRTY IN HERE.

      OKAY, LISTEN TO ME,
     IF YOU WERE CALLING ME

   AND YOU WERE PRANKING ME,
      LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL,

        THAT IS GROUNDS
   FOR DISMISSAL HERE, MISSY.

    AND I AM SURE THAT JERRY
  WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

  WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU GO
     AND TELL HIM, KRISTEN?

     GOOD, I'M TEXTING HIM
  RIGHT NOW WITH MY OTHER HAND

      THAT YOU CAN'T SEE.

WHATEVER.
        - NO.

       WE NEED TO HURRY.
        JERRY'S COMING.

            - OKAY.
       - WHAT DID YOU DO?

   I'M JUST BEING RESPECTFUL.
   HE DESERVES SOME DIGNITY.

       EVERYONE DESERVES
         SOME DIGNITY.

        - EVEN RAPISTS?
      - YES, EVEN RAPISTS.

             OKAY.

          PULL HARDER.

     HEADING TO 400, COPY.

   OVER AND OUT, GOOD BUDDY.

WHERE ARE WE TAKING HIM?

THE PRESIDENTIAL
        SUITE IS EMPTY.

          LUNCH TIME.

     GOOD MORNING, LADIES.

      SORRY. I DON'T KNOW
       WHY SHE'S BARKING.

          SHIT SHEETS.

     THE SHEETS ARE FILLED
        WITH SHIT. YEAH.

    SOMEONE HAD AN ACCIDENT.

       A BACHELOR PARTY.

        HAVE A GOOD DAY.
     ENJOY YOUR STAY HERE.

   SHIT. HE LIVES IN FRESNO.

      HOPE HE DOESN'T HAVE
          FAMILY HERE

      AND THEY DON'T COME
        LOOKING FOR HIM.

     MAYBE HE DOESN'T HAVE
    ANY FAMILY. OUR PARENTS
           ARE DEAD.

  YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO
WOULD TURN THAT INTO A POSITIVE.

         LOOK AT THIS.

 DUDE WON A BRONZE IN BEIJING.

    YOU KILLED AN OLYMPIAN.

  ONLY IF YOU CONSIDER HAMMER
     THROW A SPORT WHICH--

          OH NO. FUCK!

WHO WOULD CALL HIM?

     FUCK! IT'S HIS SISTER.

   OKAY, JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

     I'LL JUST LET IT GO TO
    VOICE MAIL, THEN WE'LL--

<i> HELLO?</i>

     -<i> I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.</i>
   - IT'S A REALLY OLD PHONE.

       - I DIDN'T KNOW.
            -<i> HELLO?</i>

 YOU HAVE REACHED THE VOICEMAIL
           BOX OF...

         BORIS LIP-KA.

  AT THE TONE LEAVE A MESSAGE.

             BEEP!

         <i> HEY. IT'S ME.</i>

    <i> I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY</i>
<i> JERKING OFF IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM</i>

     <i> LIKE A DISGUSTING PIG</i>
          <i> RIGHT NOW,</i>

   <i> BUT YOU BETTER COME HOME</i>
<i>FOR DAD'S BIRTHDAY PARTY TODAY.</i>

    <i> I'M SO FUCKING SICK OF</i>
    <i> DEALING WITH THESE TWO</i>
      <i> INVALIDS ON MY OWN!</i>

  <i> YOU BETTER BE HERE BY 3:00</i>

   <i> OR I SWEAR I'LL COME GET</i>
          <i> YOU MYSELF.</i>

   OKAY, SO THEY'RE NOT CLOSE
 AND HIS PARENTS ARE INVALIDS.

 I FEEL LIKE THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

    WHEN HE DOESN'T SHOW UP
            AT 3:00

      HIS SISTER IS GOING
    TO COME LOOKING FOR HIM.

    WHAT IF WE DUMP HIS BODY
       AT DRY CREEK CANAL

  AND MAKE IT LOOK A SUICIDE?

           ISN'T THAT
  WHERE EVERYONE DUMPS BODIES?

  HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT?

           OF COURSE,
  THE RAPIST HAS A RAPIST VAN.

         LET'S HURRY UP
     AND GET HIM IN THERE.

   LOOK, SHAN, HE WAS TRYING
      TO BE A GOOD PERSON.

       HE WAS IN TO YOGA.

        WE CAN STILL GO
         TO THE POLICE.

        WE'RE NOT GOING
      TO THE POLICE, OKAY?

     WE'RE DUMPING THE BODY
         AT DRY CREEK.

UNLESS YOU CAN FIND HIS PARENTS'
     ADDRESS IN HIS PHONE.

     AND THEN-- THEN WHAT?

 JUST PUT HIM ON THE DOORSTEP,
         RING THE BELL?

        "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
     HERE'S YOUR DEAD SON."

     CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

           CALM DOWN.

JUST FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY
  TO MAKE HIS BODY DISAPPEAR.

       GIVE ME THE PHONE.
      JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

     ALL RIGHT, HERE IT IS.

     MOM AND DAD'S ADDRESS,
         BOOM AND BOOM.

       WHAT ARE WE GOING
    TO DO WHEN WE GET THERE?

         I HAVE A PLAN.

USE YOUR KEY!

          WHO ARE YOU?

    I'M A FRIEND OF BORIS'S,
   AS YOU MUST BE HIS SISTER.

          - YES, I AM.
       - I'M HIS FRIEND.

       BORIS DOESN'T HAVE
          ANY FRIENDS.

         I'M HIS SISTER
  AND I'M NOT EVEN HIS FRIEND.

             WELL--

           - WELL--
         - WHERE IS HE?

   UH...HE'S-- BORIS IS MORE
      THAN A FRIEND TO ME.
       I'M HIS LIFE GURU.

       OH, THIS IS GOOD.
 SO HE'S GOT A LIFE COACH NOW?

             GURU.

           OH, GURU.

            - YEAH.
         - INTERESTING.

     SO WHAT KIND OF STUFF
     DO YOU ADVISE HIM ON?

      THE BEST PROSTITUTES
            TO FUCK?

    I CAN SEE WHY YOU WOULD
            SAY THAT

 AND THAT HAS BEEN HIS PAINFUL
     REALITY FOR SOME TIME,

         BUT I'M HOPING
   WITH MY HELP AND GUIDANCE

  WE CAN MOVE HIM THROUGH THAT
   AND I CAN HELP HIM CHANGE.

       WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
      THAT HE WASN'T HERE

          TO HELP ME
      WHEN I WAS CHANGING
      POP'S DIAPERS, HUH?

       COULDN'T HELP HIM
   WITH THAT I GUESS, RIGHT?

 ARE YOU FEELING A LOT OF PAIN?

             - YES.
        - CAN I COME IN?

         OKAY, COME IN.

          GURU, GURU.

YES, I'M A--

          GURU, GURU.

GURU.

       GURU, GURU, GURU.

         SO I'M HERE TO
        REPRESENT BORIS.

            AND HE--
 HE HAS COME TO THE REALIZATION

    THAT HE HAS BEEN LIVING
          IN THE PAST.

      AND ALTHOUGH WINNING
    AN OLYMPIC BRONZE MEDAL

  IS A MAJOR LIFE ACHIEVEMENT,

        HE'S NEVER BEEN
 ABLE TO REALLY MOVE PAST THIS.

    SO WE'VE DECIDED THAT'S
  IT'S DUE TO FEAR OF FAILURE.

    HE'S AFRAID OF FAILING!

   SO WE'VE DECIDED THE BEST
        THING FOR BORIS

 RIGHT NOW IN ORDER FOR HIM TO
 START OVER IS TO LEAVE FRESNO
            FOREVER.

    TO NEVER EVER COME BACK,

       TO SEVER ALL TIES
        WITH HIS FAMILY

     AND TO NEVER EVER TALK
         TO YOU AGAIN.

  THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO DEAL
       WITH ALL DAY LONG.

          HE REQUESTED
 THAT I GIVE YOU HIS BACKPACK.

  BORIS, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE!

       BORIS IS SO SORRY
          THAT HE HAS
      TO LEAVE THE FAMILY,

          BUT HE KNOWS
       IT'S THE ONLY WAY

     HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE
          TO GROW UP.

             POOPY!

          YOU BETTER--

    YOU THINK SHE BOUGHT IT?

          I THINK SO.
      BUT THIS WILL HELP.

           "SELL THIS
     AND GET OUT OF FRESNO.

          I LOVE YOU.
       BUT I CAN'T CHANGE
        ANOTHER DIAPER."

        X-O-X-O, BORIS.

       YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD.

  WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH HIM?
 SHOULD WE JUST LEAVE HIM HERE?

          NO, DUMBASS
       WE SHOULD ROLL HIM
       BACK TO THE HOTEL

   AND FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

           GOD, SHAN,
        DO YOU JUST HAVE
     TO SMOKE ALL THE TIME?

           YES, I DO.

           YOU KNOW,
     WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
   A SERIOUS DROUGHT, RIGHT?

              YES.

      I MEAN, DO YOU JUST
      WANT THE WHOLE PLACE
      TO GO UP IN FLAMES?

   ACTUALLY, YEAH. THAT WOULD
   KIND OF SOLVE OUR PROBLEM,
     IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

    WE KNOW SOMEBODY WHO HAS
   A PLACE RIGHT AROUND HERE.

             WE DO?

            GERALD?

     WHAT THE FUCK, MARTHA.

       BE QUIET AND ADMIT
       IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

    ALL RIGHT. AND YOU WERE
  SAYING THE BREED WAS A DANE?

          GREAT DANE.

         - A GREAT ONE?
YEAH, THAT'S WHY HE'S SO BIG.

          OKAY. SO...

        YOU DO REMEMBER?

    COME ON, MAN. MY SISTER.

           I'M SORRY.

    - HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
             - HEY.

              HEY.

 THESE ARE OLD FRIENDS OF MINE,
      SHANNON AND MARTHA.

   IS THIS THE SCOOTER GIRL?

     HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

     YOU TOLD ME ABOUT HER
   ON ONE OF OUR FIRST DATES.

        WOW. YOU REALLY
         LISTEN TO ME.

        I LISTEN TO YOU
      WHEN YOU TALK, BABY.

  BUT YOU LOOK THE OTHER WAY.
        IT'S INCREDIBLE.

             YEAH.

       WHAT'S IN THE BIN?

  REALLY HOPE IT'S A DEAD DOG
 BECAUSE WE COULD USE THE CASH.

  SENSITIVITY, HONEY, PLEASE.

   I'M SORRY. WE REALLY HOPE
  IT'S YOUR DEAD DOG. PLEASE?

         THAT'S BORIS.
      HE JUST PASSED AWAY,

        SO WE'RE HOPING
      TO GET HIM CREMATED.

      GERALD WAS SAYING WE
     COULD HAVE THE FRIENDS
    AND MY FAMILY DISCOUNT.

           I'M SORRY.

           YOU KNOW,
       THIS IS THE REASON
     WHY WE'RE STUCK HERE.

     THIS, BULLSHIT FRIENDS
       AND FAMILY THING.

      NOT EVERYONE IS YOUR
       FAMILY AND ALMOST
     NO ONE IS YOUR FRIEND.

          CAN WE WALK
      AROUND THE CEMETERY
    AND DO THIS. IT'S JUST--

       WE ALSO-- WE NEED
  TO GET THE BIN CREMATED TOO.

     THERE ARE NO DISCOUNTS
     AND THE BIN IS EXTRA.

          THAT'S FINE.

          WE CAN PAY.

             OKAY.
   HAND ME THE TAPE MEASURE.

FOR WHAT? WHY DO YOU NEED THE--
 WHY DO NEED THE TAPE MEASURE?

 - WE HAVE TO MEASURE FOR THE--
       - WE ALREADY KNOW.

      NO, WE MEASURED HIM.

     IT'S THE AVERAGE SIZE
        OF A GREAT DANE.

        IT'S FIVE FOOT,
     SOMETHING, SOMETHING.

         JUST CHARGE US
      A GREAT DANE PRICE.

    THE EXTRA, EXTRA LARGE.
           IT'S FINE.

     - YOU GUYS CAN LEAVE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE HIM.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE HIM.
    - I HAVE TO MEASURE HIM.

         WHAT THE FUCK?

   WE SAID DON'T MEASURE IT!

           I'M SORRY.
   WE NEED TO CALL THE COPS.

           WHAT FOR?

        - I'M WITH RUBY.
           - SHUT UP.

       WE OWN A BUSINESS,
           ALL RIGHT?

    WE CAN LOSE EVERYTHING!
 THERE'S A HUMAN BODY IN HERE.

    I UNDERSTAND THAT, OKAY?
            LISTEN.

   - DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
          - YES, I DO.

     WELL, I'M THE BUSINESS
       PERSON HERE, OKAY?

          WE AGREED--
       WE AGREED ON THAT.

    AND I SAY WE DON'T CALL
           THE COPS.

  BECAUSE IF WE CALL THE COPS,
    WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

      NOTHING'S GOING TO--
    THEY'RE GOING TO GO JAIL

      AND WE'RE NOT GOING
        TO GET ANYTHING.

           NO REWARD.

            I MEAN,
     YOU THINK THAT THE GUY

   WHO FOUND THE SLAVE GIRLS
            IN OHIO?

            - OHIO?
        - ARIEL CASTRO.

       YEAH. DO YOU THINK
        THAT THAT GUY--

      DID HE GET ANYTHING?
       BECAUSE HE DIDN'T.

           NO. UH-UH.

      HE GOT, LIKE, A HUG
    FROM A LITTLE WHITE GIRL

        AND THEN HE GOT,

LIKE, AN EMBARRASSING INTERVIEW
      LIKE GOT AUTO-TUNED

          AND, LIKE,
     PUT ALL OVER YOUTUBE.

    THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT.

        NO, NOT AT ALL.

    WE'RE GOING TO BLACKMAIL
       THESE TWO BITCHES.

        ARE YOU KIDDING?

         WE WANT 25,000
 TO GET OUT OF THIS BUTT CRACK

   AND WE WANT IT BY SUNDAY.

WHAT?

 THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN COME UP
    WITH 25K IN THREE DAYS.

        WE'RE IN FRESNO.

            - YEAH.
   - I'M PRETTY SURE YOU CAN.

   YOU SEEM VERY RESOURCEFUL.
     SO THREE DAYS, 25,000.

             - 25?
     - WE CAN GO TO DETROIT
           WITH THAT.

     WE COULD DEFINITELY GO
          TO DETROIT.

      WE COULD MOVE THERE
    AND WE SET UP SHOP AND--

    AND GUESS WHAT, YOU GET
     A CREMATION OUT OF IT.

    YOU KNOW HOW GOOD WE ARE
         AT CREMATION?

   WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT THEM.

       A FUNERAL SERVICE
   LIKE YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE.

  BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T
       GET THE MONEY THEN

 YOU'RE GOING TO BE CHARGED FOR
 MANSLAUGHTER, SO THERE'S THAT.

   WHAT ABOUT A PAYMENT PLAN?

     NOBODY EVEN HAS THAT.

            LAYAWAY?

  CAN I GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT
  ADVICE AS FAR AS BODIES GO?

    THAT GUY IS GOING TO ROT
  IF YOU DON'T GET HIM ON ICE.

  THAT'S ALL. IT JUST HAPPENS.

         IT'S BIOLOGY.

    WHAT A STUPID ASS IDEA.

            GERALD.

    COME ON, HE BURNS THINGS
      FOR A LIVING, OKAY?

    FOR $25,000! AND THEY'LL
   PROBABLY STILL TURN US IN.

   THEY'RE NOT TURNING US IN.

     SHE SAID SHE WANTS OUT
           OF FRESNO.

      THE ONLY WAY TO GET
      25K IS DEALING DRUGS
        OR PROSTITUTION.

     I JUST PAID THOUSANDS
      TO PUT YOU IN REHAB

     AND I DOUBLE MORTGAGED
           MY HOUSE.

      YOU'RE NOT BECOMING
         A PROSTITUTE.

      I'M NOT HAVING SEX.
       I'LL BE YOUR PIMP.

        I'M NOT TOUCHING
         SWEATY BALLS!

   THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS SWEATY.

      JUST PRETEND THEY'RE
       TINY LITTLE BOOBS.

           OKAY FINE.
        WHAT ABOUT THIS?

        WHAT IF WE PULL
         THE FIRE ALARM
          IN THE HOTEL

          AND STEAL IT
      FROM THE FRONT DESK?

   I WON'T JEOPARDIZE MY JOB.

    LISTEN! IF WE DON'T GET
        RID OF THIS BODY

     THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO
            TO JAIL

    AND YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE
         A JOB, RIGHT?

      YEAH, WELL, THANKS.
    THANKS TO YOUR SMOKING,

   I FOR SURE LOST MY V.I.P.
         PARKING SPOT.

             OKAY.

   THIS IS GOOD. PEOPLE ONLY
   PAY IN CASH AT SEX SHOPS.

         LET'S ROB IT.
            MM-HMM,
            MM-HMM.

           IT'S GOOD.

I CAN BARELY SEE.

D.I.Y. TOILET PAPER,
          IT'S GENIUS.

     I KNOW THIS PLACE AND
  THE WORKERS ARE ALWAYS HIGH.

   IT'S EASY MONEY. COME ON.

        THIS IS STUPID,
   SHAN, WE LOOK RIDICULOUS.

DOES ANYBODY WORK
             HERE?

     DOES ANYBODY WORK HERE?

    YEAH, SORRY SMOKE BREAK.

      OH, I LIKE THE T.P.
         ON YOUR HEAD.

    IT'S ALL RAPEY AND SEXY.

      I AM VERY INTO SCAT.

    I NEED YOU TO COME OVER
         HERE RIGHT NOW

  AND OPEN THIS CASH REGISTER
 AND I NEED ALL THE CASH, NOW.

      YEAH, GET OVER HERE.

    WHO KNEW SEX SHOPS WERE
   SUCH A CASH POOR BUSINESS.

     THESE DILDOS HAVE GOT
     TO BE WORTH SOMETHING.

       COME ON, LET'S GO.

        I CAN'T BELIEVE
       WE ONLY MADE $400.

        IT'S FAIR TO SAY
  WE OVERESTIMATED THE MARKET.

        THAT'S A FUCKING
        UNDERSTATEMENT.

       LESBIANS ARE POOR.

        THEY ALWAYS ARE
    AND THEY ALWAYS WILL BE.

   SHAN, DON'T BE HOMOPHOBIC
        RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

     I ONLY TELL THE TRUTH.

     WELL HERE'S THE TRUTH.

        WHOSE GREAT IDEA
WAS IT TO ROB A SEX SHOP, OKAY?

       IT'S WASN'T MINE.
        THAT WAS YOURS.

       LET ME REMIND YOU.
    THAT WAS MY SECOND IDEA.

MY FIRST WAS TO ROB HOTEL ROOMS,

  BUT SOMEBODY WAS TOO SCARED
     OF GETTING IN TROUBLE.

         YOU KNOW WHAT?

WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THESE DILDOS
  AND SHOVE THEM UP YOUR ASS?

      OH, THAT'S A REALLY
       NICE THING TO SAY

  TO A RECOVERING SEX ADDICT.

      COULD YOU NOT BE SO
      ANNOYING RIGHT NOW--

  YOU STOP BEING SO ANNOYING!

         STOP IT! STOP.

 YOU WANT TO GET TITTY FUCKED?

      I'LL TITTY FUCK YOU!

       - TITTY FUCK THIS!
 - NO! OKAY! YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

       - OH, MY GOD. OW!
            - YEAH.

      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
          GET OFF ME!

NO, IT'S MY TURN TO HURT YOU.
  - WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU?

      WE WOULDN'T BE HERE
     IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

       OH, SURE. BLAME ME
         FOR EVERYTHING
      WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.

     BLAME ME FOR MOM DYING
       OF CANCER AND DAD

        DRINKING HIMSELF
         TO DEATH. OW!

         I ALREADY DO!

      WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

      WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

 WE STILL HAVE A ROTTING CORPSE
         TO DEAL WITH.

         YOU KNOW WHAT?

        JUST TURN ME IN
      BECAUSE I DON'T GIVE
        A SHIT ANYMORE.

             FUCK!

     GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE.

        YOU'RE WELCOME.

      AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY
           THANK YOU?

       MOST PEOPLE WOULD.

  FROM WHAT YOUR SISTER SAYS,
    YOU'RE NOT MOST PEOPLE.

       WELL, MARTHA NEEDS
         TO LEARN HER
      FUCKING MOUTH SHUT.

          WHOA! WHOA!

           LANGUAGE.

             LOOK,
  I KNOW IT CAN BE DIFFICULT,

         BUT, YOU KNOW,
 YOUR SISTER'S PULLING FOR YOU.

      SHE'S A GOOD PERSON.

        HOW DO YOU KNOW?

       SHE HELPED ME QUIT
         SMOKING WEED.

        IT DOESN'T LOOK
   LIKE SHE WAS VERY HELPFUL.

      I USED TO SMOKE WEED
       LIKE ALL THE TIME.

 I NEVER GET ANY WRITING DONE.

        NOW I JUST SMOKE
     BEFORE AND AFTER WORK,

     AND I GET STUFF DONE.

      IN REHAB WE HAD MORE
 OF AN ALL-OR-NOTHING APPROACH

       WITH A LITTLE BIT
        OF HIGHER POWERS

       SURRENDER YOURSELF
     BULLSHIT PEPPERED IN.

         DOES IT WORK?

   IT SEEMS TO IF YOU BELIEVE
      YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

     SO WHAT DO YOU WRITE?

      UH...I WRITE POETRY.

            REALLY?

  SO YOU'RE ALL DEEP AND SHIT?

      I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.

     WELL, LET'S HEAR ONE.

            FRESNO.

    I DON'T LIKE IT ALREADY.

            FRESNO.

    LORD, WHY IS IT SO HOT?

      DID YOU MEAN FOR IT
        TO BE THIS HOT?

   OR DID YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE
     IN A HURRY AND FRESNO

    WAS THE OVEN YOU FORGET
          TO TURN OFF?

            FRESNO.

YES, THAT SMELL IS DEAD ANIMAL.

        DO YOU LIKE IT?

            FRESNO.

        WHERE IS STUFF,
        LIKE, ANYTHING?

   FRESNO, WHERE THE BEST JOB
  I COULD GET IS THE WORSE JOB

         I'VE EVER HAD.

   NO, HOTEL GUEST, I CANNOT
  TELL YOU WHERE ANYTHING IS.

IF KNEW WHERE ANYTHING ELSE WAS,
         I'D BE THERE.

            FRESNO.

            COME ON!

        COME ON, MARTHA.
     MY DEAD GRANDMA COULD
     KICK HARDER THAN YOU.

          THERE WE GO!

            COME ON!

         SO, LIKE SANDS
     THROUGH THE HOURGLASS,

 SO ARE THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES.

       THAT'S PLAGIARISM.

    I LITERALLY WROTE THAT.

          WHETHER YOU
       BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

         - I THINK SO.
       - THAT'S SO LAME.

       THAT'S PARTIALLY.

     I THINK YOU DON'T KNOW
       ENOUGH ABOUT PROSE

       TO REALLY GIVE ME
     AN ACCURATE CRITIQUE.

   I KNOW ABOUT PROS. I KNOW
  ABOUT PRO BASEBALL PLAYERS.

  I KNOW ABOUT PRO BASKETBALL
    PLAYERS. I KNOW ABOUT--

    I'M OFF WORK, LIKE NOW.

          DO YOU WANT
      TO GO DO SOMETHING?

             I DO.

OKAY, EVERYONE
          IN A CIRCLE.

      YES. FASTER, FASTER,
        FASTER, FASTER!

  KRAV MAGA. WE HAVE ONE RULE,
         ONE RULE ONLY.

      NEVER STOP FIGHTING!

HIYAH.
HIYAH.

   THANK YOU. BRYAN EMAIL ME,
   WEDNESDAY ABOUT PRIVATES.

       WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

            - OKAY.
            - COOL.

HOW LONG HAS ALICIA
      BEEN WITH THAT DUDE?

         I DON'T KNOW.

  I DON'T REALLY TALK TO THEM.

          YOU WERE AT
      THAT SOFTBALL THING.

     OH YEAH. OH, I DIDN'T
       WANT TO INTERRUPT.

   YOU THERE WITH YOUR DATE.

             YEAH.
    TANYA IS JUST A FRIEND.

             - YUP.
       - HE'S THE WORST.

           TOMORROW?
        WHAT'S TOMORROW?

   OH, MY GOD, PLEASE TELL ME

    YOU ARE GOING TO NOAH'S
  BAR MITZVAH TOMORROW NIGHT?

       I ACTUALLY WASN'T
         EVEN INVITED.

        WELL, LUCKY YOU.

     NOAH'S PARENTS PAY FOR
   PRIVATES SO I HAVE TO GO.

      AND YOU HAVE TO COME
            WITH ME.

    LIKE AS YOUR FAKE DATE?

      NO, AS A REAL DATE.

         IS THAT A YES?

          WHOA! WHOA.

            - WHAT?
   - LET'S-- DO YOU WANT TO--

           - LET'S--
    - LET'S GO TO THE DESK.

  NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

     CAN WE JUST SLOW DOWN
         A LITTLE BIT.

            - WHAT?
PLEASE, CAN WE JUST SLOW DOWN?

        ARE YOU... WHAT,
    TELL ME YOU'RE NOT GAY?

        NO. I MEAN, NO.
          I MEAN, NO.

  LET'S TALK. JUST TALK, OKAY?

      OH GOD, YOU ARE GAY.

          NO. MY GOD.

          I DON'T KNOW
   WHY I'M TELLING YOU THIS,

         BUT-- JESUS...

  I HAVEN'T SLEPT WITH ANYONE

          SINCE ME AND
     GIRLFRIEND BROKE UP A
     COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

           SERIOUSLY?

             YEAH.

         DO YOU, LIKE,
 NOT LIKE CONDOMS OR SOMETHING?

              NO.

      DO YOU WANT A DRINK?
      I'M GOING TO HAVE--

    WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

         WHAT THE FUCK!

          OH, MY GOD.
  MARTHA, WOULD BE SO PISSED.

     DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK
           TO REHAB?

       I'M A SEX ADDICT,
   NOT AN ALCOHOLIC, ASSHOLE.

           - REALLY?
        - YEAH, REALLY.

   I DON'T-- THAT'S A THING?

   I THOUGHT THAT WAS MADE UP
  BY TIGER WOODS OR SOMETHING.

      DON'T BE A DUMBASS.

          OKAY. WELL--

  AND THIS IS A PERFECT TIME.

    BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU
        ALWAYS DO THIS.

            DO WHAT?

      BABY, LISTEN TO ME.
       LISTEN RIGHT NOW.
         I DON'T WANT--

    YOU NEED TO START FACING
 YOUR FEARS AND YOUR FEELINGS.

       YOU'RE JUST GOING
    TO KEEP HURTING YOURSELF

   AND EVERYBODY AROUND YOU.

   WELL, THAT'S THE LONG WAY
           TO SAY NO.

      SHAN, I HAVE TO GO.

OW!

      I'M GOING TO GET IT
       NICE AND STRAIGHT.

              OW!

         STOP YELLING.

        IT DOESN'T HURT.

        SORRY, I GUESS
       I'M JUST NERVOUS.

     ABOUT THE BAR MITZVAH?

    ERIC'S GOING TO HELP US.

       THINK YOU'VE EVER
         BEEN IN LOVE?

  I'M NOT GOOD WITH EMOTIONS.

       AS SOON AS I START
    TO GET CLOSE TO SOMEONE,

    I JUST-- I FEEL CROWDED

     AND I'M NOT ATTRACTED
        TO THEM ANYMORE.

    HOW MANY GUYS YOU THINK
       YOU'VE BEEN WITH?

        - I DON'T KNOW.
      - LIKE A BALL PARK.

        LIKE A HUNDRED?

           100 DICKS?

      STUPID THING IS MOST
      OF THE TIME I DON'T
       EVEN LIKE THE SEX.

     THEN WHY DO YOU DO IT?

         I DON'T KNOW.
   LIKE THE PAIN OF DOING IT

        IS NOT AS BAD AS
         THE EMPTINESS
        OF NOT DOING IT.

     DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

            MARTHA.

             YEAH.

       I WAS A 100% WRONG
        ABOUT YOUR HAIR.

     - WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
        - IT'S NOT GOOD.

         DO COUSIN IT.

           NO, SHAN,
    I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.

        - YES, YOU ARE.
  - SHANNON, I'M NOT DOING IT.

      DO I LOOK PRETTY FOR
     THE BAR MITZVAH PARTY?

    HEY, IF TONIGHT DOESN'T
  GO TOO LATE MAYBE YOU COULD

  COME OVER AND, I DON'T KNOW,

    WATCH "NAKED AND AFRAID"
          WITH ME OR--

          YEAH, MAYBE.
     WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.

         HEY, LADIES,
        IT'S DOPEY KING.

        YEAH, OF COURSE.

    GOT YOU SOMETHING, SIR.

   OH, THANKS. THAT'S SWEET.

  I'LL PUT IT IN MY MONEY BOX
          OVER THERE.

        IT'S CASH ONLY.

        YEAH, WE HEARD.

             YEAH.
     IT'S ACTUALLY COUPONS
       FOR FREE PRIVATES.

     PRIVATES? YOU HITTING
           ON ME BOO?

         I'M A MAN NOW,
       SO IT'S COPASETIC.

     DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

     ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
      TAKE IT EASY, NOT IN
       FRONT OF MY DATE.

      DON'T TALK TO KELLY
           LIKE THAT.

    IT'S REALLY RUDE, NOAH.

 DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS CAN MAKE
  OUT ON MY NEXT MUSIC VIDEO?

     GOOGLE GLORIA STEINEM
        AND THEN ASK US.

        SO HOW LONG WILL
       THESE THINGS LAST?

        ABOUT AS LONG AS
 A WEDDING RECEPTION, YOU KNOW.

           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.

      I DON'T REALLY KNOW
        HOW LONG THAT IS

    BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN
         TO A WEDDING.

            REALLY?

         I WENT TO ONE,
     BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY
    COUNT BECAUSE WE ELOPED.

        YOU'RE MARRIED?

          YEAH. WHAT?

       I CAN BE MARRIED.

     I TOTALLY GOT MARRIED.

 AND NINE DAYS LATER I CHEATED
  ON HIM AND WE GOT DIVORCED.

  SUPER ROMANTIC LIKE I SAID,
   LIKE A FAIRYTALE ACTUALLY.

          I'D READ IT
        COVER TO COVER.

  I'M THINKING OF PITCHING IT
     AS A CHILDREN'S BOOK.

       - OH, YOU SHOULD.
           - OR Y.A.

        THAT'S PROBABLY
       THE BETTER CHOICE.

             YEAH.

     Y'ALL READY FOR THIS?

          I'M 13 NOW.

             WHOO!

    I WANT TO THANK MY DAD,

    I WANT TO THANK MY MOM,
 AND I WANT TO THANK MY BUBBY.

      OKAY, LET'S DO THIS.

 COME ON BOYS. CASH MONEY TOUR.

THAT'S IT, NOAH.

     WELCOME TO MY MITZVAH!

        THAT IS ENOUGH.

      THAT IS ENOUGH. HEY.

        - QUITE ENOUGH!
  - I WAS IN THE DANCE, NOAH!

     THANK YOU FOR COMING.

      WHY DOESN'T EVERYONE
    GET ON THE DANCE FLOOR?

          LET'S DANCE
   TO SOME APPROPRIATE MUSIC.

YOU'RE SHAMING
           YOURSELF.

    I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING
TO BE BRUNO MARS. GET OVER HERE.

        YOU KNOW WHAT,
      NOW WE GOTTA DANCE.

         I DON'T DANCE.

         I THINK WE DO.
    IT'S A PART OF THE DEAL.

        - I DON'T DANCE.
           - COME ON.

      I'VE NEVER, NEVER--

           ALL RIGHT.
   BRING IT IN. BRING IT IN.

  YOU HAVE A REALLY CUTE ASS.

       IT'S DISTRACTING.

   STOP. IT'S A BAR MITZVAH.
      THERE'S KIDS AROUND.

          I'M SERIOUS.
       IT'S DISTRACTING.

            MY ASS?

             - YES.
          - OH, SURE.

      IT'S 'CAUSE YOU WORK
        ME OUT SO GOOD.

           HEY, MAYBE
         WE SHOULD TAKE
          A BREATHER.

            - OKAY.
  - GET A DRINK OR SOMETHING?

        I'M GOING TO USE
        THE LADIES ROOM.
       DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

             UH-UH.

   I, LIKE, REALLY LIKE YOU.

  AND SINCE YOU WON'T TELL ME

  WHY YOU'RE BEING BLACKMAILED
     I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR

       I GET TO DO THIS.

EXCUSE ME.
       IT'S TIME TO STRAP
        ON THE FEEDBAGS.

         DINNER WILL BE
     IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES

 IF OUR VERY EXPENSIVE CATERING
COMPANY WOULD JUST DO THEIR JOB.

           GOOD LUCK.

         OKAY, ALRIGHT.
             READY?

         - YEAH, YEAH.
            - OKAY.

              SO?

       SO, YOU GUYS LOOK
     PRETTY CUTE TOGETHER.

   YESTERDAY, YOU WERE PISSED
  BECAUSE I WAS ALONE WITH HIM

        AND NOW YOU WANT
       US TO GET MARRIED.

           NO, SHAN,
       THIS IS DIFFERENT.

      HE REALLY LIKES YOU.
          I CAN TELL.

        I KNOW. I THINK
     I SHOULD JUST FUCK HIM
     AND GET IT OVER WITH.

        WILL YOU NOT SAY
       THAT KIND OF SHIT
         ALL THE TIME?

   OKAY. ERIC'S IN POSITION.

OKAY, GOT IT.

      ARE YOU OKAY THERE?

              AHH!

    A WOMAN IS CHOKING HERE!

          - OH MY GOD!
  - SOMEONE HELP HER, PLEASE!

          - THANK YOU.
     - OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

         UH-OH. UH-OH.

             - GO.

    I THINK IT'S A SEIZURE.

    I THINK IT'S A SEIZURE.

       EVERYONE GET BACK,
           GET BACK.

  NOBODY PANIC, NOBODY PANIC.

    SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE.
        WATCH HER ARMS.

        SHE'S SLAPPING--

GIVE HER SOME AIR!
        JUST STEP BACK!

COME ON, DAD!

   NOAH, DIRECT THE TRAFFIC.

   DO SOMETHING, NOAH! JUST--

CALM DOWN.

         IT WILL STOP.
     JUST LET HER BE CALM.

          WHOA, WHOA.
      NO, JUST CALM DOWN.

      DON'T HURT YOURSELF.

        LET HER BE CALM.

 WHOA! WHOA! OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
          JUST VOMIT.

OKAY, EVERYBODY BACK. CALM DOWN.

          OH, PEANUT.

THAT IS REALLY
    A BAD THING THESE DAYS.

        THERE'S PEANUTS
         IN EVERYTHING.

           ALL RIGHT.

    GIVE IT UP FOR THIS GUY.
      THIS GUY IS A HERO.

          HERO! HERO!

          - THANK YOU.
         - HERO! HERO!

       - THAT WAS CRAZY.
  - YEAH, IT WAS PRETTY CRAZY.

         ARE YOU OKAY?

      YEAH, I THINK I AM.
         IT WAS JUST A
       SEIZURE, I GUESS.

    OKAY. I THINK WE SHOULD
    JUST GO BACK TO MY PLACE

  SO I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

        HOW ABOUT THAT?

 OH GOSH. I DON'T KNOW, KELLY.

   I THINK I SHOULD PROBABLY
       JUST GO HOME ALONE

       'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
       I NEARLY JUST DIED
          KIND OF SO.

       OKAY. WHAT IS IT?

    DO YOU NOT LIKE HANGING
   OUT WITH ME OR SOMETHING?

       NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
     IT'S, LIKE, SHANNON--

   MY SISTER IS-- AT MY HOUSE
     SO I HAVE TO BE THERE.

         OKAY. YOU HAVE
         TO STOP USING
       YOUR ADULT SISTER

          AS AN EXCUSE
      FOR BLOWING ME OFF.

    I'M NOT BLOWING YOU OFF.

     I DON'T WANT YOU THINK
      I'M BLOWING YOU OFF.

      WELL, I'M AVAILABLE,

    LIKE, TOTALLY AVAILABLE.

    AND I'M GAY AND I'M VERY
       ATTRACTED TO YOU.

          I DON'T KNOW
      IF YOU NOTICED THAT.

       I LIKE YOU A LOT.

     AND I'M COOL AS SHIT,
         SO I DON'T SEE
      WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

        AM I LIKE, WHAT?
        AM I COMING ON
          TOO STRONG?

  AM I SUPPOSED TO PLAY GAMES
          AND PRETEND

     LIKE I DON'T LIKE YOU
      AND BE MEAN TO YOU?

   IS THAT WHAT ALICIA DOES?

    SHOULD I BE LIKE ALICIA
   AND FLIRT WITH OTHER GUYS
           IN THE GYM

           TO, LIKE,
   MAKE YOU ATTRACTED TO ME?

  I'M NOT A GAME PLAYER OKAY.

      I'M OVER THAT SHIT.

     I'M A GROWN ASS WOMAN

     AND I FUCKING LIKE YOU
       SO LET'S DO THIS.

      WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

      I DON'T KNOW, KELLY.

         I DON'T THINK
       IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

       WAIT, WAIT, KELLY!

    HEY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT,

      YOU SHOULD SIGNED UP
          FOR SPINNING

        BECAUSE MY CLASS
HAS A NO ASSHOLE POLICY NOW, SO.

    WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

      NOTHING, I'M SORRY.

  I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WAS HERE
    SO I'M JUST GOING TO GO

      AND YOU CAN CONTINUE
       YOU'RE BLUBBERING.

 - JUST PRETEND I AM NOT HERE.
    - YOU'RE SO INSENSITIVE.

     ARE YOU EVEN A WOMAN?

     HEY, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

        NO, YOU'RE NOT.

      OKAY FINE. I'M NOT!

   I SAW AN "OPRAH" ON THIS.
      YOU'RE A SOCIOPATH.

   HEY WAIT-- NOW LISTEN I AM
      NOT SOCIOPATH, OKAY?

         I FEEL STUFF.

          I EMPATHIZE
  AND I SYMPATHIZE WHICH MEANS

   THAT I'M NOT A SOCIOPATH!

   OKAY, WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE

         THEN WHY DON'T
   YOU ASK ME WHY I'M CRYING?

    ALL RIGHT, I CAN DO IT.

         WHAT'S WRONG?

  OKAY, WELL WHEN I CONFRONTED
       SCOTT ABOUT YOU--

          WHO'S SCOTT?

          MY HUSBAND,
     THE ONE THAT YOU BLEW.

    OH, YES, OKAY. AND SCOTT
   YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT...

    YEAH, HE DIDN'T DENY IT.

    HE ADMITTED IT WAS TRUE.

             OKAY.

      AND THEN I ASKED HIM
        IF IT WAS GOOD.

        AND I COULD TELL
      THAT HE DIDN'T WANT
        TO SAY ANYTHING

   BUT I FORCED IT OUT OF HIM

      AND HE SAID THAT IT
      WAS THE BEST BLOWJOB
          OF HIS LIFE.

        AND NOW WE JUST
      CAN'T STOP FIGHTING

      AND I CAN'T HAVE SEX
            WITH HIM

     AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
      WHAT I'M GOING TO DO

       BECAUSE I JUST--
         I CAN NEVER--
      I CAN NEVER DO THAT!

          YEAH, OKAY,
         YOU CAN DO IT,
         YOU CAN DO IT.

         YOU KNOW WHAT,
    I KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS.

        WE'LL USE THIS.

       I'M GOING TO TEACH
      HOW TO GIVE THE BEST
     BLOWJOB OF YOUR LIFE.

       OKAY, BUT HOLD ON,
        CAN WE USE THIS?

      DOESN'T SURPRISE ME
      PHIL TOOK THE CASH.

     HE WAS IN BUCHENWALD.

  BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET FREAKY
   WHEN THERE'S A HOLOCAUST.

       IT WAS A GOOD RUN!

         "SUCKY, SUCKY
       MY BIG FAT COCK!"

         SORRY, HONEY.

  SO, WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY DO?

      I JUST CLOSE MY EYES
           AND THEN--

    LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE EATING
          A CORN COB.

        THAT'S NOT GOING
    TO FEEL GOOD TO ANYONE.

            - OKAY.
            - OKAY.

       ALL RIGHT SO WHAT
      KIND OF PORN DO YOU
      GUYS WATCH TOGETHER?

         NO PORN, NONE.

       WATCH A PORN ONCE
     IN A WHILE BY YOURSELF

         AND WATCH HOW
       THE CHICKS DO IT.

          AREN'T MOST
     OF THOSE WOMEN SLAVES?

       NO, THEY'RE FINE.

      OH, I THOUGHT I SAW
       A "DATELINE" ABOUT
     THAT THEY WERE SLAVES.

              NO.

   NO, THEY PUT THEM IN A BOX
      AND SHIP THEM OVER--

     NO, THAT'S-- NO THOSE
      ARE THE MANICURISTS.

             OKAY.

        NO, THOSE AREN'T
        THE PORN STARS.

     - THEY'RE NOT SLAVES.
            - OKAY.

OKAY, SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO--
            - YEAH.

    IS YOU WANT TO PRETEND,

   LIKE, WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE
       FOOD IN THE WORLD?

        YOPLAIT YOGURT,
      CHEESE CAKE FLAVOR.

      OKAY. SO I WANT YOU
      TO PRETEND LIKE THIS
           IS FILLED

   WITH CHEESE CAKE FLAVORED
        YOPLAIT YOGURT.

             OKAY.

       AND IF YOU SUCK IT
         HARD ENOUGH--

             YEAH.

     YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT
            ALL OUT.

            - OKAY!
            - OKAY?

     SO NOW IN ORDER TO GET
    OUT THE YOGURT YOU HAVE
         TO SQUEEZE IT.

      AND YOU WANT TO PUT
     YOUR MOUTH ON THE TIP.

             OKAY.

   NOW YOU'RE GOING TO BRING
     YOUR HANDS UP TO MEET
          YOUR MOUTH.

  - AS YOUR MOUTH GOES DOWN--
            - OKAY.

       YOUR HAND GOES UP.

       AND IT'S LIKE THAT
     AND IT'S-- SO THEY'RE
           GOING TO--

   - MOUTH BENEATH THE HAND.
             - YES!

   - MOUTH BENEATH THE HAND.
             - YES!

    MOUTH BENEATH THE HAND.

 - YEAH! YOU'RE GOING TO GET--
           - MOUTH--

        NOW RIGHT BEFORE
      YOU'RE GOING TO GET
    YOUR HAND UP TO THE TOP,

     HOLD IT REALLY TIGHT,
       SPIT IN YOUR PALM,

     RUB IT AROUND THE TOP,
         POINT IT AWAY,

        SHOOTS OUT INTO
        THE STARS, OKAY?

            - OKAY.
          - ALL RIGHT.

         YOU GOT THIS.
      NOW GO, GO, GO, GO!

      GOT SOME TECHNIQUE!

       - YEAH, THAT'S IT.
          - THANK YOU!

             OKAY.

        WHAT DO YOU MEAN
       IT'S ONLY 12,000?

       COME ON, COME ON.
      IT'S A LOT OF MONEY,

          IT'S LIKE--
    THAT'S LIKE SIX DIGITS.

    I SAID I WANTED 25,000.

        WELL YOU CAN GET
       A HOUSE IN DETROIT
        FOR, LIKE, $800.

     I DIDN'T WANT A HOUSE!

      I WANTED A BUILDING.

     COME ON, RUBY, PLEASE?

         BUT IT'S CASH.

            I MEAN
      IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE.

       IT'S A GOOD START,
    GET EVERYTHING ROLLING,
           YOU KNOW?

IT'S A GREAT START.

   I'LL SELL THE THUNDERBIRD.

 - YOU'LL SELL THE THUNDERBIRD?
 - I PROMISE! I DON'T NEED IT.

          SUPER COOL.

             OKAY.

    WE'LL TURN THE OVEN ON.

      IT WAS REALLY SWEET
        OF YOU TO COME.

           OF COURSE!

   YOU COULD'VE JUST TOLD ME

    YOU'RE BEING BLACKMAILED
  FOR KILLING SOME GUY'S DOG.

      I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.
          I STILL DO.

      THIS IS MY LAST DOG!

     SUCK MY DICK, FRESNO!

   WHAT'S UP WITH THAT CHICK?

  OH, SHE'S MOVING TO DETROIT.

          OKAY. UM...

         LET'S ALL BOW
       OUR HEADS AND HAVE
      A MOMENT OF SILENCE.

   BORIS, OH PRECIOUS BORIS.

       HE WAS A CHAMPION
  BUT HE WAS ALSO A DIRTY DOG.

 OH, GOD, PLEASE WATCH OVER HIM
AND TAKE HIM TO A BETTER PLACE.

EVERYONE DESERVES THEIR DIGNITY.

     WE'VE ALL DONE THINGS
      WE'RE NOT PROUD OF.

         THE LAST TIME
      I WAS AT A CEMETERY

  WAS FOR MY FATHER'S FUNERAL.

    IT WAS NOT AN EASY TIME
         FOR ANY OF US

BUT ESPECIALLY NOT FOR MY SISTER
SHANNON BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T SHOW.

 I KNOW SHE WANTED TO BE THERE

    BUT SHE COULDN'T BECAUSE
     SHE DIDN'T FEEL GOOD.

       I DON'T BLAME HER.

          IT'S JUST--
   SOMETIMES IT'S HARD FOR ME

  TO DO EVERYTHING ON MY OWN,

           SO I GUESS
    I'M JUST REALLY GRATEFUL

        THAT WE MADE IT
  THROUGH THIS TIME TOGETHER.

             YEAH.

          HI, MARTHA.

        MARTHA! MARTHA!

    WE SLEPT TOGETHER BEFORE

        SO THERE'S LIKE
A GRANDFATHER CLAUSE SITUATION,

    THEY STILL BUILD THESE.
       ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

         LITTLE SHEDS?

 MARTHA! MARTHA, STOP RUNNING!

        MARTHA, COME ON!

        WAIT, I'M SORRY!

 SORRY, YOU'RE NOT SORRY, SHAN!

       IT'S NOT MY FAULT!

        IT'S MY DISEASE!
        I CAN'T HELP IT!

       OF COURSE, RIGHT.
         YOU NEVER MEAN
        TO DO ANYTHING.

 YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST LIKE DAD.

   JUST BLAME EVERYONE ELSE.

     IT'S NEVER YOU, RIGHT?

 WELL, I AM SO TIRED OF TRYING
          TO HELP YOU.

            MARTHA!

    YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME HERE!

  DON'T COME BACK TO MY PLACE!

           I'M DONE!

     IT'S HARD LETTING GO,
           ISN'T IT?

        IF ONLY POP TART
       COULD'VE SPOKEN UP

          AND TOLD ME
    WHAT WAS BOTHERING HER.

     BUT TURTLES CAN'T LET
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING, CAN THEY?

      ROBOTS CAN'T EITHER.

         BACK SO SOON?

 STAYING FOR A WHILE THIS TIME.

       YOU HIT THE LOTTO?

     THIS IS LEFT OVER FROM
       BAR MITZVAH MONEY.

           GOOD LUCK.

MY MOM DIED OF CANCER
  THEN MY DAD DIED OF ALCOHOL,

    AND MY LITTLE SISTER HAD
      NO ONE TO HELP HER.

  AND INSTEAD OF HELPING HER I
JUST BLEW OFF MY DAD'S FUNERAL.

   AND A FEW MONTHS AGO I DID
   SOME REALLY HORRIBLE SHIT

   WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE, AND
 MY SISTER BAILED ME OUT AGAIN.

   AND SO DID THIS-- THIS GUY

 THAT I MET WHO'S REALLY NICE,
    AND I REALLY LIKED HIM.

       INSTEAD OF DEALING
        WITH MY FEELINGS

      LIKE A MATURE ADULT,
        GROWN UP PERSON,

    I FUCKED A RANDOM DUDE.

       I JUST DON'T WANT
  TO LET ANYONE DOWN ANYMORE.

          I DON'T WANT
   TO LET MYSELF DOWN ANYMORE

      AND I WANT THIS PART
          OF MY LIFE--

  THIS WHOLE CHUNK TO BE OVER.

    AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
      BECAUSE I NEED HELP.

     I'M JUST FUCKING TIRED
          OF FUCKING.

             FUCK!

   SORRY, IT WASN'T MY TURN,
           I'M SORRY.

            YOU KNOW
    WHO WOULD'VE LOVED THAT?

             OPRAH.

       I HAVE PAYCHECKS!

    THIS ONE IS FOR MARTHA.

          THAT'S YOU?

    AND THIS IS FOR SHANNON,
        YOUR BIG SISTER.

      SHE'S GOING TO HAVE
   TO PICK HERS UP. SHE QUIT.

 AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ANYMORE.

            WHY NOT?

           LET'S SEE.

  SHE'S A LIAR, SHE'S SELFISH,

       SHE'S UNGRATEFUL,
         AND SHE CAN'T
     GET HER LIFE TOGETHER.

   IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY SAD.

        MY SISTER SUCKS.

       WHY DOES SHE SUCK?

 WERE YOU NOT LISTENING, JERRY?
I JUST TOLD YOU THE WHOLE THING.

    SHE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS!

              WHY?

     BECAUSE SHE JUST DOES
  WHATEVER THE HELL SHE WANTS,

      AND SHE DOESN'T CARE
  WHO SHE HURTS ALONG THE WAY.

    I MEAN, I DID EVERYTHING
        I COULD FOR HER.

      I GOT HER THIS JOB,
   LET HER STAY AT MY PLACE,

 AND IT'S LIKE SHE JUST DIDN'T
      EVEN WANT ANY OF IT.

 WELL, IF SHE DIDN'T WANT HELP,
     WHY DID YOU HELP HER?

         I DON'T KNOW.

   SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED HELP.

             UH...
     I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.

    YOU WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT
 YOUR SISTER AND NOT YOURSELF.

    MY LIFE IS PRETTY SWEET.

        IT'S NOT SWEET.

      YOU LIVE ALL ALONE.
  AND YOU'RE A MAID IN FRESNO.

       YOU'RE A MAID TOO,
           YOU KNOW.

      YES, BUT I'M BETTER
          THAN A MAID.

        EXECUTIVE MAID!

  AND I HAVE SEXY GIRLFRIEND.

YEAH,
      CAN YOU JUST, LIKE,
   PUT THEM BACK RIGHT AWAY.

     'CAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS
      GETTING TANGLED UP.

     KELLY, YOU DON'T HAVE
        TO HIDE FROM ME.

   HEY, ALICIA IS WORKING OUT
      AT PRESTOWN CROSSFIT

     SO YOU SHOULD GO SIGN
           UP THERE.

    I DON'T WANT TO SAY "HI"
           TO ALICIA

   I WANT TO SAY "HI" TO YOU,
             KELLY.

              HI.

  I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU,
             OKAY?

           I'M SORRY.

        I WASN'T MYSELF.

YEAH, JUST A LOT OF WEIRD STUFF
    WAS GOING ON IN MY LIFE.

      YOU SAY YOUR SISTER
    OR YOUR EX ONE MORE TIME

    I WILL LITERALLY VOMIT,
           RIGHT NOW.

         WELL, I WON'T.

    OKAY? BECAUSE NEITHER OF
  THEM ARE IN MY LIFE ANYMORE.

       I MEAN IT'S GOOD!

    LIKE FOR THE FIRST TIME
           IN MY LIFE

      I'M DOING STUFF JUST
          FOR MYSELF.

     LIKE, I GOT A PEDICURE
           YESTERDAY

   AND I TOOK A BUBBLE BATH,
           YOU KNOW?

     WOW, YOU TOOK A BATH.

             YEAH.

  AND NOW I'M DOING THIS OTHER
  THING I REALLY WANTED TO DO,

       TALKING TO A GIRL
  WHO I THINK IS PRETTY COOL.

      I REALLY LIKED YOU.

       I STILL LIKE YOU.

             OKAY.

       BUT IF YOUR SISTER
        AND YOUR EX ARE,

         LIKE, TOTALLY
       OUT OF THE PICTURE
         FOR REAL THEN

  WHAT ARE YOU POSSIBLY GOING
      TO USE AS AN EXCUSE

     NOT TO GO OUT WITH ME
            TONIGHT?

            TONIGHT.

            NOTHING.

          NEWSFLASH--
         I'M AVAILABLE.

           - REALLY?
          - BIG TIME.

       YO, YO, YO! GURU!

      DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

        I THINK YOU HAVE
       THE WRONG PERSON.

            NO, NO.
     YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

        MY PARENTS HAD A
       HOUSE THAT SMELLED
      LIKE DIRTY DIAPERS?

     DOES THAT RING A BELL?

             - NO.
YOU REMEMBER THIS PRETTY FACE?

           YEAH, HI!

 YOU GOT ANYMORE AWESOME WORDS
       OF WISDOM FOR ME?

          OH, I DON'T.

       I'M KIND OF OUT OF
       THE GURU BUSINESS.

             WHAT?

          I'M WORKING
      AT FOSTER FARMS NOW.

 OH WELL THAT'S GOOD FOR FOSTER
    FARMS BUT BAD FOR GURUS.

   YOU WERE SO GOOD AT THAT!

       I GOT TO TELL YOU
     MY WHOLE LIFE CHANGED

      BECAUSE OF THE STUFF
          YOU TOLD ME.

          REALLY, HOW?

        I SOLD THE VAN.

       I'M PAWNED BORIS'
         BRONZE MEDAL.

    I SOLD MY PARENTS' HOUSE
    FOR A SHITLOAD OF MONEY.

      I FIGURED THEY'D BE
       BETTER OFF ROTTING

      IN THE NURSING HOME,
           YOU KNOW.

     GOT A REAL GOOD PRICE
       ON A NURSING HOME,

   ONE OF THE CHEAPEST ONES.

      AND THAT WAS REALLY
      ALL BECAUSE OF YOU,
      I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

        AND I'M GETTING
        A CHIN IMPLANT.

          I NEVER SAID
       ANY OF THAT STUFF.

         LISTEN, GURU,
        I FELT YOUR VIBE
       AND I RAN WITH IT.

     IF YOU EVER SEE BORIS
          YOU TELL HIM

        WE'RE BETTER OFF
   WITHOUT EACH OTHER, OKAY?

    SIBLINGS CAN REALLY SINK
     EACH OTHER, YOU KNOW?

     TELL HIM I SAID THAT,
             OKAY?

     TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!
            NAMASTE!

<i> 911, WHAT'S</i>
        <i> YOUR EMERGENCY?</i>

 IT'S NOT REALLY AN EMERGENCY.

        I KILLED A GUY,
       SO SOMEONE SHOULD
   PROBABLY COME AND GET ME.

         <i> PLEASE HOLD.</i>

     <i> NOW, I'LL CONNECT YOU</i>
     <i> TO THE FRESNO POLICE.</i>

       <i> PLEASE STATE YOUR</i>
       <i> PRESENT LOCATION,</i>

        <i> PARAMEDICS HAVE</i>
       <i> BEEN DISPATCHED.</i>

       NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
    TO SEND THE PARAMEDICS.

   IT WAS A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

      IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

  I'M SURE EVERYONE SAYS THAT,
      BUT IT, LIKE REALLY
        WAS AN ACCIDENT.

       WELL, DO YOU THINK
    THAT MAYBE SOMEONE COULD

   JUST COME HERE AND GET ME
  BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A CAR?

   THAT'S A REALLY FAR WALK.

<i> SO ANYWAY, SHAN, I'M</i>
<i>GLAD YOU'RE GETTING MY LETTERS.</i>

<i>I MISS YOU BUT I'M KIND OF GLAD</i>
        <i> YOU'RE IN JAIL.</i>

          <i> AND I MEAN</i>
    <i> THAT IN THE NICEST WAY.</i>

        <i> YOU BETTER LOOK</i>
  <i> LIKE LINDA HAMILTON IN "T2"</i>

       <i> WHEN YOU GET OUT.</i>
        <i> BABY GOT BACK!</i>

       <i> LIKE ACTUAL BACK,</i>
        <i> IT WAS AWESOME!</i>

<i>I'LL SEE YOU NEXT MONTH AND TRY</i>
   <i> AND STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.</i>

             <i> HUGS.</i>

<i> MARTHA.</i>

       <i> P.S., I HATE YOU</i>
   <i> WHICH IN CASE YOU FORGOT</i>

<i>MEANS I LOVE YOU LIKE A SISTER.</i>

   I DID LEARN THIS THIS FROM
       "HOT KNOCKERS 4."

           OH, BABY.

          SHAN! STOP,
        YOUR MY SISTER.

       HOLD STILL, BABY.

      THANK YOU. YOU ARE--
   YOU HAVE A TREASURE TROVE.

          YOU'RE LIKE
        THE MAYA ANGELOU
        OF DICK SUCKING,

        AND I MEAN THAT.

 IT WAS JUST A BIG URINE CAKE.

IT'S TRUE.
     - I GOT IT! I GOT IT!

          I WAS JUST--
 I WAS JUST A BIG URINAL CAKE.

     THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY--
           I'M SORRY.

     EVERYONE'S EXCITED BUT
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

       LIKE, LIKE, LIKE!

         WHAT ARE WE--
      WHAT ARE WE JACKING?

         MAYBE IT'S ME,
    MAYBE IT'S JERRY GARCIA,

     MAYBE IT'S COUSIN IT.
         NOBODY KNOWS.

      HELLO, I'M HERE FOR
       YOUR BAR MITZVAH,
            SHALOM!

   COME AT YOU AND I'LL FUCK
  YOU SO HARD YOU'LL COME OUT
           YOUR BUTT.

         INTO THE LENS?

     NO, I CAN'T LOOK AWAY.
       I CAN'T LOOK AWAY.
       I CAN'T LOOK AWAY.

      YOU WANT US TO COME
          ON THE CART?
