-It's okay, baby.

It's okay.

I'm fine.

It's gonna be alright.

<i>We gotta go</i>

<i>We gotta go now.</i>

<i>Alright?</i>

Alright, they're gone!
Let's keep moving!

-We think we should stay here.

-Why's that?

-Because there's food here?

We can sleep here?
-Alright.

If that's enough
for you, that's fine.

-I'm scared. I don't even...

-You know you're
just exposing yourselves.

<i>-Don't listen to him.</i>

<i>No, baby, keep
your eyes up.</i>

<i>Eyes up.</i>

This is a bad idea.

-Yeah. if you want to keep drinking
the water here, that's fine with me.

But we're going to base.

-I thought you said
they were gone!

-Well, they're not gone enough.

-Look around you.

These houses aren't going to
protect you. We got to keep moving.

-Are you alright?

-Yeah, no..I trust you.

-Thirsty?

No, uh...

I can make it.

-Now that we got some time,

I want to talk about what
we were talking about earlier.

-We don't have to.
-No, no,no...I want to.

-No, I just...
-I think we can work on this.

Babe...
-I know, I heard something.

-Why you acting like that?

-Like <i>what</i>?

-Like you know what
I'm already gonna say.

-I have a few guesses.

-They want me out of
 town, for a few days.

-Yeah, that was my second guess.

-It's just to Denver.

-Just to Denver.

I assume that means
you'll be missing Jill's  wedding.

-Look, you've made a lot
of sacrifices the past few months

and I'm trying to
make sacrifices, too.

Okay?

You know, the ones
that I can make.

So do you...uh...

Do you know this song?

-No.

-Oh...

Well, I haven't...
I haven't heard you

play in a while.

-Yeah, I...

haven't lately.

David!

We're out.

-Shit, it's...it's Tori.

-I don't care if it's Tori.
-Look, it will just be a minute.

<i>-David...</i>

-David...

Don't go home.

There's someone in our house.
I don't know what's happening...

It's Jill, they killed her.

They're not people...

<i>They killed her.</i>

<i>Those people...</i>

They killed Sam and Lori and...

They tried to kill
me too, and I...

I don't...

I don't know what to do.

-Should have turned
your phone off dude.

-Oh, yeah! Thank you!

-You know the day you hear that
 coming from him you know it's serious.

-Well, when you're at
work, of course it's different.

-Shit!

-You're gonna look like an idiot
 in Denver if you don't get that finished.

-I'm gonna look like in idiot
anyways by myself, David.

You got some time to think
about it, just don't let me down.

-Okay, just do me a favor.
Just make sure

you wear your Floaties
when you jump on the pool.

Okay?

I'm serious. I'm not going
to be there to catch you this time.

-No, no, no...it's okay,
it's okay.

It's okay.

I'll see you in twenty.

I...I need to go into the office.

-Okay.

-David!

-Hi! Great place you
got here, man.

Really cute, yeah.

I'll see you later? It was
good seeing you.

-You, too.

-It's not always like this.
-I know how it is.

-I have to go to Denver.

-Maybe that's best.

<i>-Please, please help.</i>

There's people out
here. Some of them are hurt.

-I'm not a doctor, I...

-No...We need to use your car.

You can drive us!
We just need to get him some place safe.

-Okay...
-Alright.

Thank you so much.

Oh, my god!

Hey! You okay?

Yeah, you okay.

We're not far. Follow me.

-All these people, where did
 they come from? Why are they still ...?

-Listen, I need your
 help! We need to hurry!

-Look, we can't just leave them here!

-Hey! this is the world
we live in right now!

We have to worry about
those of us who are still alive.

-How far?
-Just up here.

-No, I mean how far do
you need me to take these people?

-Not sure. Somewhere safe.
-Where's safe?

-There's an evacuation point at the end
of the valley. Just not sure where.

Found someone with a car.

-We can't fit all these people.
-We'll make trips.

We need to go.

-My dad can't move!

-I can help.

Let's get him up.

-You aren't looking
too good yourself.

-I'm fine.

What's wrong with
these people?

-Well, they drank the water.

I bet that most people
are like them by now.

Docile and...

stupid.

If we ever did
stand a chance,

we sure don't anymore.

-Where did you come from?

Haven't you been seeing
everything that's been happening?

-Tori's flight gets in at 6.

Man, do you think that

Tori'd ever let me

diddle her honeypot?

-You're gonna bring this up again?

-I'm just saying, dude.
I think I've got a shot.

How many drinks do you think it
would take for her to actually like...

lower her standards?

-First off I don't...

Yeah, you do have
a shot, yeah.

She's just your
boss, no big deal.

Yeah, great.

-Shit, dude.

Come on.

Another plane went down.

-<i>Another one?</i> Like in...?

-Yeah, that's two planes.

<i>-We've just received an update
that the vice president</i>

<i>has moved to the war
room of the White House</i>

<i>and has put states' National
Guards on alert</i>

<i>and possible deployment.</i>

<i>We're not sure, at
least not at this moment.</i>

<i>Whether we're under...</i>

-Nobody even knows what
the hell is going on.

-Just throwing darts
against the wall.

-Is this about the
planes from this morning?

-Where have you guys been?

I mean, the last plane
was like an hour ago!

I mean... nine planes,
that ain't no accident.

<i>-We will first pray for those
who've had friends and family involved.</i>

<i>We had these terrible tragedies.</i>
-What'd they hit?

-All kinds of stuff, and
all over the place, too.

I mean, this isnâ€™t like
9-11. That was like<

<i>-The tenth plane just went
down the Dallas, Texas area</i>

<i>That makes ten planes down
in just a matter of the past few hours.</i>

<i>And the stock market is going
to close early to avoid any</i>

<i>impact on the economy
until we know more.</i>

<i>So far an estimated 754 have
 been killed in the past seven hours...</i>

<i>which is the second worst
disaster in aviation history.</i>

<i>The only other event</i>

<i>in which more lives have been lost was</i>

<i>of course September 11th, 2001</i>
-Dave...

<i>in which time 2907 people perished.</i>

<i>- ...homeland security...there has
been no credible evidence.</i>

<i>of terrorist activity related
to the recent plane crashes.</i>

<i>The spokesmen went on to
say that people should remain calm</i>

<i>and not flood the airport phone lines
with inquiries regarding loved ones</i>

<i>that may have...</i>

<i>-The terrorists are responsible.</i>

<i>-Terrorists don't have the kind of...</i>
-Shh.

-Major routes around the
airport are shut down until further notice.

-Understood. I...I need to get

back home and I'm off...I'm
off the next exit.

-You're gonna have to find another way.

-Well, there is no
other way.

-What can I tell you, man?
it's a madhouse out there.

but no one gets on or off, alright?

<i>-When are you and
the rest of the nation....</i>

<i>...for reelection soon...</i>

Hey, what are you doing?

<i>-...confirmed that flight 556</i>

<i>that was due into Denver in
the national airport,</i>

<i>at around 4 PM this afternoon,</i>

<i>is one of the planes
that crashed earlier today.</i>

<i>The flight left Salt Lake City</i>

<i>international, but did
not make it far out...</i>

<i>-...Close our communication
and out supply.</i>

<i>We can't let the bombs
in the hands of the enemies.</i>

<i>-But authorities have already
said that this is not a terrorist attack.</i>

<i>If it's not terrorists,</i>

<i>what is it?
-Well I don't know what it could be.</i>

<i>I mean, planes are
going down all...</i>

<i>-Oh no.</i>

What the hell...

-David?
-April...

Are you home?

-Yeah, why?

<i>-indistinct</i>

-C...call me back,
'cause this is a bad line.

<i>-I'm coming home.</i>

-What?

-Baby...

-Did you and Sam fight a lot?

-I know it's a lot.

My mama always said

'When you ain't fighting,
you ain't talking."

-My parents...

They never seem to
be in different places.

And with David it
always seems like that.

-Where did you come from?

Haven't you been seeing
everything that's been happening?

-I'm just trying to get back home.
-Bad idea.

I mean, all the protection you're
going to have is at the evacuation point.

You might just stay there.

-I'm not far from the
north end of the valley.

I need to find my family.
-There's nothing there.

-What?

-Everything's gone.

Everyone's dead.

-Shouldn't be.

My wife is still there.

-The entire valley is gone.

-Amy.

<i>-...most of the people of
the hospital are experiencing...</i>

Amy.

...<i>It is medically
referred to as Coda.</i>

<i>it can be characterized by</i>

<i>depression....fatigue...</i>

<i>...hunger and insomnia.</i>

-Hey man. You okay?

-Excuse me!

Hello!!

Where's your car?

How did you even
get out here?

Look...um...

If you need a ride, I
can give you a ride to the next town.

You know, there is probably
someone in the next town that can

help you and they
might even have a phone.

Um...

I don't want any...

Hey.

Um...

okay.

So uh...you from
around here?

Finally.

All this time and no other
 cars in the road, it's just...

just too weird.

Look...uh...

are you on something? 'Cause

this is starting to get really old.
-Light.

-Yeah, they got lights.

Looks like they've set up a roadblock.
-What?

-What...What is wrong
with you, okay?

Why...why do you keep
mentioning light? What about light?

-Light!
-What about the damn light?

-Okay hold up.
let's get this guy out.

We'll take him and whoever
needs medical attention first.

-Need any help?

-Hey I got this!
-Look, look, I just want to get

home to my family.
-Roads are closed to all westbound traffic.

It's all I can tell you.

What's wrong with that guy?

-I...I don't know. I saw him
outside the tunnel, I picked him up

And he...this guy keeps freaking
out about...about a light.

You know...maybe I can
leave him here with you

guys and...and...
someone...till someone comes...

-No sir that's not gonna work.
We can't do that.

-Hey!!!

-Hey, sir!

You're gonna have to
keep moving

You're going to have to
get back and drop him off...

-What the hell are you doing?

Please.

They're here.

-How far are we talking?

You see something?

-David?

I...I'll be right there.

Sam.

-We've got to get
to the hospital.

-I can't see waiting...
-I'll get the car.

-No, you stay here.

-Why wouldn't you let me take you?

-Enough.

Just listen.

-We had these drawn up.

-Powers of attorney?

-And living wills.

-Hey man, you in there?

Hello?

Where are you?

Hello?

You there?

Come on, man.

Hey!

What the hell are you doing?

I'm leaving right now.
Are you coming or not?

Holy shit!

We need to go.

Hey.

We need to go home.
-Yeah.

Right, let's go.

Alright, let's go.
Hide.

-No!!!

-Ah!

-Hello.

-Hello!

Help!!!

-indistinct

-indistinct

-Hey, up here!

-Yeah, Tommy, you first.

-indistinct

-Wait!

Drive, get out of here!

-Wait, wait, wait...there
still might be people out there.

-No, there's no way...
-We have to wait!

-No! there's no...I'm telling
you there's no point!

-Of course there's a point!

-No, I'm not being
heartless, I'm being reasonable.

Come on, we're gonna get
killed if we sit here.

-That's them.

-There's too many.

-We have to go!

-There's too many!

-Go!

-It's okay.

-<i>What's</i> okay?

We just left all
those people out there to die.

-We didn't have time.
They would have killed us too.

-I...I could have waited.
 I could have fit a few of them.

-They were already dead.
-That's bullshit!

Okay?

Alright. We saw
them running.

I saw them running and I

I can't make that excuse.

-It's just how it is.

-How can you act like that
when there's innocent people being killed?

-Hey! If you've been in
your car this whole time,

let me tell you: you have
some shit ahead of you.

I've seen enough death in the
last 24 hours to know how to save myself.

I'm not trying to be
heartless, just...

Is that your family?

-It's my wife.

-Do you have kids?

-No.

-Could you imagine
if you did?

In a time like this
how would you explain it to them?

First we'll protect them.

-You mean Amy?

-What were you waiting for?

-What?

-You and your wife.
Why were you waiting to have kids?

-Isn't it a bit forward
on you, don't you think?

-I'm just talking.

-I know that we never
even wanted kids.

-You're married. That's
just what other people want from you.

Okay, so what was your excuse then?

-I don't know.

I guess first it was work mostly.

Well, full time,

then you're overtime...

I don't know. I...I
guess we both just wanted

to get to a certain point
before we felt like we could

you know...settle down and...

eventually.

-Eventually...

So you really think you're
gonna find your wife in all this mess?

-Yes.

-If I were you, I'd
prepare myself not to.

-You know what? I...
I don't need this. Okay?

Don't talk like that.
-I'm not trying...

-No, it's none of your business.

She's...she's smart.

Alright? She'll be fine.

-Alright.

-She...she could be out there.

But I don't think that it's
a good idea for you to go looking for her.

-Well, thank you for your sympathy.

-It would just...it
would be nice to save

just one life today.
that's all I'm saying.

-I'll be fine.

-I'm Samantha.

-I'm David.

-Hi.

-Whew. Thank God!

Are you okay?

<i>-Yeah.</i>

-I got a hell of a
time getting ahold of you,

-Yeah, the news said that
most of the cellphone towers are down.

<i>-And most of the
roads are closed, too.</i>

Is everything okay?

-No...

-Are you hurt?

-Kailey's sick.

She...

She couldn't move her body,
she couldn't...

I don't know what was wrong with her.

-Where is she?

-Um...a neighbor took
her to the vet.

-Thank God you're alright.

-Wait, wait, wait.
What time is it?

-Almost three.

I couldn't wait. After
last night, I had to see you.

-Well, what's been happening?

-Haven't you seen the news?

-I fell asleep. Is it... I
mean, did I miss something?

-Let's just get you some coffee.

You have no idea how
good it is to be here.

<i>-It could be something atmospheric...</i>

<i>okay, that's causing
planes to crash,</i>

<i>It could be something
extraterrestrial,</i>

<i>basically it's beyond
our field of vision right now.</i>

<i>It's a Black Swan event and
we're not equipped to deal with it.</i>

-The neighbor's a vet.

He works out of his house

and I take her.

-Wait, I...I can't leave.

Not with everything
that's going on.

-What could possibly
happen here?

-I don't know...

I can't not be here if

they come back and...

I don't...I don't know
what to do.

-When I was driving
over here today,

there was only one thing
that I could think of.

All the money, all the
success, it meant nothing,

The only thing that mattered to me was
 that I got one more chance to see you

and tell you that the only
way that anything could matter again

was if we could
share it together.

You and me.

-I can't.

-Yes you can.

And you know what you have, right here.

I know.
-Don't. That's not fair.

-None of this is fair, Amy.

You don't know how much time you
have left with everything that's going on.

I <i>want</i> this.

<i>I want this.</i>

-I...I have to stay.

Even if it's a small
chance, I have to.

-If I leave,

right now, without you,

there is no way that
we can know what could happen.

<i>-I can't...</i>

<i>-That's good.</i>

<i>It's good.</i>

<i>She's gonna be okay.</i>

Just stay inside.

Okay?

Look, babe, I'm having a really
hard time staying awake.

I mean I'm just gonna...I'm
gonna pull over

really quick and just
take a quick nap.

<i>I'm tired.</i>

<i>Look, I'm going to
make it back to you, okay?</i>

I'm going to make
it back to you.

You trust me?

-I trust you.

<i>-Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

Well, Samantha, no...
no kids, eh?

-No.

-Did you have an excuse?

-Well, when I first

got married, we

said that we would

wait until we could afford
to get a pool for the backyard.

But I don't think
that was it.

He got a good job and...

I got a better job.
We surpassed that.

We didn't get the
pool for the backyard.

We stopped talking
about having kids.

It's so interesting, isn't it?

What people think marriage
is for at the beginning?

it's like a...

a free ticket out
of our old life.

It's always gonna be better.

Or at least you're not
gonna grow old and

die alone with no one
beside you.

But for me that

that...that feeling

comes from disappointing someone,

that...that never really went away for me.

Even...even in the
good times.

We were married seven years.

We had the divorce papers

all ready to sign

before all this

happened.

With the strange timing
pf it all I still managed

to become

separated.

All these feelings that
you have in the end shouldn't

shouldn't make up
for all the

boredom and

disappointment that

that you felt before.

Should they?

-You know that...software I got you last
year makes changing music much easier.

-But there's no
connection to the notes.

I...I like writing by hand.

-Well, I was going to
take Kylie out,

Decompress a bit.

Do you want to take
a break and come along?

-You know, I'm...

I'm kind of at a place
where I shouldn't stop.

<i>Please.</i>

-Yeah, no problem.

-I'm taking a job with Brad.

-Oh, so that's it then?

You've decided?

-One of us has to do something.

One last thing for us
to not talk about.

-Come on. Seriously?

It's not always like this.
-I know how it is.

-I have to go to Denver.

-Maybe that's best.

-Hello?

<i>-I wasted it.</i>

-Ryan, where are you?

<i>-I'm alone.</i>

And you know
who gives a shit?

<i>No one.</i>

-Settle down, you've been drinking....

-Damn right. I've been drinking.

No one even knows
I'm here, Amy.

Tori's probably dead

<i>and David bailed.</i>

<i>...and it hits me</i>

I've got

nothing.

<i>Hey, hey...it's
okay. Hey, Hey.</i>

<i>Hey there...hi.</i>

<i>Um...where's your
family at?</i>

<i>I don't know where my
family is either. Can I sit here?</i>

It looks like you
have an <i>owey</i> there, huh?

David...

Is he...is he
home yet?

<i>Oh, let me take a look.</i>

<i>Oh, it's gonna be okay.</i>

Oh! Is that your bow?

Can you hold this here for me?

You know...

I can be looking
to find my family a

a long time, so

maybe we should just try and

try and find yours, okay?

You know...what  direction
 do you think they went?

Oh, that way? Okay.

Come here.

Come here.

<i>How did he know it's over?</i>

-What?
-David?

He knows it's over
between you two.

He told me how rough it's been.

-Of course.

<i>Damn it.</i>

What are you...doing?

-Are you okay?

What are you doing
out here alone?

Where's your family?

-Get away from her!

-I was just trying to
make sure she was alright!

I am on your side!

Does your phone work?

Hello!

Is she okay?

-Get out of here!

-I just want to get home.

Do you know the quickest
way to Salt Lake?

-Get...off...my...land!

-Okay, alright.

You got it.

I'm just gonna get some water

And then I'm leaving.

I really appreciate this.

-No! No!

it's in the water.

Whatever they're bringing, its

They put something in the water!

They got my animals.

They took my family.

They ain't getting no more!

-So who's...who's 'they'?

<i>Jesus...</i>

What is this?

-In or out?

Let's go!

Those bastards want a fight;
they got it.

-Damn it, Kate! I said no more!

No more! No more.

<i>Anything comes through
that door,</i>

<i>I'm emptying this thing.</i>

<i>Shit...</i>

<i>I forgot to lock the back door.</i>

<i>Shit!</i>

Caitlin, no! Stop!

-Ah!!!!!

Ah!!!!!

Ow!!

Ah...Ah!!!!

Ah!!!

-Sam!!

-Lori?

Lori!

Sam, what happened?

Sam!

Someone help us!

Tell him I'm
gonna go get my keys.

Dan, you stay with her, okay?

<i>-No!</i>

<i>No!</i>

-Brad wants to start
a firm with me.

-That was pretty quick.

What about Chemtech?

-He quit...two weeks ago.

And he already has
everything in place.

New office, new clients...

It'll be...smaller, but...

I mean something.

I'll actually feel
like I'm making a difference.

-Well, what about things around here?

-That is so unfair.

-What?

-Don't make me feel
guilty about this.

What have you done for us?

-I'm going to that wedding with
you tomorrow, I mean that's....

-She's your <i>cousin.</i>

Did you quit <i>your</i> job?

Or put <i>your</i> dreams on hold?

Have you done anything for us?

-I've cut way back on work!

You know that!

-Then where are you every day?

Every night?

-Just give me a
minute, okay? I got...

-I can't compete with
your damn phone!

I...I...I'm done.

-Okay fine! It's off now!

Now everything is
going to be better!

Maybe now with
my phone off.

we might be able to
have a conversation at dinner!

Or no, maybe all
our fights

will turn into polite discussions!

I...I should have known
this whole time it would be this phone!

The phone is the only problem!

It's just the phone!

-David?

Do you want me to take over?

-No, I'm good.

-I think I know
where we are now.

I can get us into the valley
 if you want to take a nap.

-It's okay, I...

No really, I'm good.

-Shit!

What was that?

Was that a person?

-I didn't get a
good look, okay?

-It's one of them.

-We gotta go.

-Wait, no.

-Why?

Samantha , come on, we don't
have time for this.

I'm not gonna pick that up.

-How else are you gonna
protect yourself? Think about it.

-No, no, no...

Oh, shit.
-Oh my God.

-Shit!
-What's wrong?

-Come on!

-What?

it is not working.

Shit!

What's that?

<i>-Oh, God.</i>

<i>-Let's just leave
him there.</i>

??? something different.

-Well, how far do
you think we have?

-Four or five miles probably.

-Alright, let's get
out of here.

-Okay.

-So you know this road?

-Yeah...

I'm pretty sure.

-Okay.

-It's somewhere, okay?

If it's not at the mouth of canyon,
that's close.

-Well, what if it isn't?

-Then I'll keep walking
till I find it.

-Well, what if there is
no evacuation point?

-If there isn't,
then I'm dead.

-You know...

You can sleep with me

if you want...

-Thanks.

-I just don't understand
how you're so comfortable

with the idea of death.

-The same goes for you.

-I'm not comfortable
with the idea of death. I...

Are you...are you okay?

Are you hurt?

-Uh, no, I just
wanted to lay down.

Wow, that's so embarrassing.

No, I'm fine.
-You tired or...

-No, it's pretty nice
down here actually..

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

Are you gonna let
me look at that?

Please?
-No, it's just...

I'm alright.
-No, it needs to be cleaned.

Maybe I...

No, it's not gonna take that long and
you need to take a break anyway.

Here.

Okay.

-So glad I found a doctor.

-Shut up. I'm just tired
of you whip around everywhere.

So...

-So...

-What do you want to talk about?

<i>-They killed Sam and Maureen.</i>

<i>They tried to kill me too, and I...</i>

<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

I never thought I'd
have to prepare for this.

I'm sorry...

I was aware about Brad, he...

he came over and I...

He's been over before
and it didn't mean anything.

-Sorry. Does it hurt?
Are you okay?

-This feels great, yeah.

-Okay...

Come on...

Talk to me for once.

-I'll talk, I just...

Don't have much to say.
-Now I know you're lying.

What's Amy like?

-She's...she's strong.

And a lot  of other things.

-Was she happy?

-Um...

That's a good question.

You know, I
could guess but...

I've been wrong before.

She doesn't smile much,

but she's always kind
of been that way.

When I first me her,
I...I just...

...thought she was unhappy.

I guess everything's on me though.

I messed up a lot.

Especially in the beginning. I...

I was unfaithful.

One night I...told her.

And then I just left.

I...I didn't give her

time to even react, I just...

I didn't want to see her.

So a few days later
I went to the house.

And...um...

she met me at the door and...uh...

she smiled.

Quitting hadn't even
crossed her mind.

I um...

I stayed.

Felt like she deserved

for me to not quit.

-So you're

looking for her so you can go
 sweep her off her feet?

-No, I don't know
why I'm looking for her.

I haven't been happy
in a long time.

And uh...

even if I <i>do</i> find her, I

I don't know what will happen.

-Maybe she doesn't
want to be found.

-She does.

-Evacuation point Come on, hurry.

-Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Hey! Hey! hey!

-We're looking for the
evacuation point!

-We got everyone out. ???

-We got room, but
we got to go now!

Come on!

-David?!

-Hey we gotta go!

-She's not there!
-How do you know that?

-We're too far from home;
she can't be out here!

-Come on! Everybody's dead
and I don't you to die!

<i>-I hope you can find me...</i>

-I can't die alone.

-Hey stop! You gotta stop!

The end
