Happy birthday to me!
Happy birthday!

Oh, that's actually
a really good one.

Wait. Anybody want this?
Oh, my god.

That's what happens
when you do a mercy invite.

I believed you wanted
to invite everyone.

Dad, I can't invite

everyone in my art class
except for one person

without social networking
evidence

inflicting more pain on
that person than was intended.

And I'm not a monster.

I'm proud of you. I think.

She gets detention a lot,

and she yells at teachers
sometimes.

Then there was that rumor
that went around

that she just kept
running away from home.

Um, maybe she can Uber.

I seriously believe
that we can go home now.

Um, did I mistakenly convey
this was a democracy?

We are not going
till she gets picked up.

Uh, the car broke down.

I'm just gonna take the bus.

You're not taking a bus.
I'll drive you home.

Claire has almost saved
her half of the money

she needs for a car.
Isn't that right?

And this will be
one of the few times left

I can drive you guys around.

Huh?

Uh, I'm...

Claire:
You won't be able to

hear my dad tell jokes
that only he thinks are funny

for an entire car ride
unless you come.

You don't really want
to miss that.

Claire: Wow. I got more gifts
than I thought I did.

Can I put this in here?
Uh, yeah, I'll get it.

Thank you, Marcia.

Claire:
Maybe he just is into...

Claire: Maybe he's just content
where he... where he is.

Hey.

Can I help you?

Claire: What?

Marcia:
If this is the one,

he's so... he's really funny.

He does these weekly videos.
This is...

See? It's so random.

It's so weird.

Claire:
Yeah, you have a crush on him.

I don't get it. Yeah, go back.
Pause it.

Why don't you get it?
I just don't get it.

Marcia: It's, like,
he's blond, and he's cute.

Claire: No, his eyebrows
are just like...

Uh, shut up. His eyebrows?

Yeah. -That's the one thing
you couldn't get?

Yeah.

I get turned on by eyebrows,
though. -

Marcia: Oh, okay.

That's pretty good.

Claire: Oh, my god.
Marcia: What? What?

Marcia: Oh. You see
what he does, though?

How does he even do that?
I don't know.

That's the whole point
why I'm showing you.

Marcia:
It's so genius.

So bad.

Claire:
Hey.

Pardon me, sir.

I think you have the wrong car.

Claire:
We woke up in here.

Claire:
What the hell is going on?

What are we doing here?

What happened to my dad?

He's out there.

Do you know
what happened to my dad?

I choose you first.

It's only gonna be a minute.

Pee on yourself.

Pee on yourself.
No!

No, no!

Claire:
No. No!

No!

Claire:
Open the door!

Are you okay?

Marcia:
He wanted me to dance for him.

Marcia:
Okay.

The outside door is locked.

Everything's okay.

We're okay.

We're okay.

Man: <i>I hear
the tiniest little splash,</i>

and here it comes.

A freak of nature, like this.

So, he comes across the stream,

and he's so tall that the water
doesn't even get to his belly.

Then he stops.

And my heart's coming out
of my chest.

You got buck fever.

Uncle John's got buck fever.

That's not true, Casey.
Your daddy's a liar.

How big was the rack?
It was huge.

Where are you supposed to look
when you shoot, Casey?

At the body. -Then why was
he looking at the rack?

'Cause he had buck fever.

She'll say anything you say.

You gonna do that when you get

your mentored hunting license
in three years?

No, sir.

Make sure you put your
gloves on after you finish.

Your feet and your hands
get cold first out there.

Three students abducted.

The father of one
of the students

woke up dazed
in king of Prussia,

reportedly drugged.

He found the kids
and the car missing.

Neighbors are in disbelief.

A normally quiet community

Is reeling after this abduction.

If you have any information

concerning the whereabouts
of these girls,

you are urged
to contact the police.

Marcia: It doesn't matter
if you open that door, Claire.

There's a second locked door.

Claire: Okay. He's gonna come
in here again any second,

and we're not letting him take
one of us out again.

We just... we just cried
and screamed,

and we didn't hurt him

because we were afraid
to get him upset.

God, that's victim shit.
Jesus.

We should fight him.

We should drop
a crazy-ass bomb on him.

I saw him carry one of you
and lay you on the bed

like you weighed nothing.

One punch from him
would knock one of us out.

I took... I took six months
of Kenpo karate class,

and you distract
the assailant with pain.

Everything is so easy
for you guys.

You do one thing,
you can predict the next thing.

It's not the way it's gonna be
in this situation.

Claire:
We're not getting out of here.

You're saying that you're not

gonna fight
with everything in you?

You know the only chance...
The only chance we have

is if all three of us
go crazy on this guy.

We have to hurry.

Marcia:
We need you, Casey.

Claire is smart.

Let's listen to her.

I'll do it
if you're gonna do it, too.

We can win.

He'll hurt us.

No. Shut up.

Both of you.

Claire: You're gonna pick
your miserable self up

and help us get out of here.

Blow me.

And your six months of karate

at the king of Prussia mall
can blow me, too.

No. No, no,
you-you can't do this today.

You can't do this right now.

Why do you do this?
Why do you act like this?

Why do you act
like you're not one of us?

When you're aiming, Casey,

always keep both eyes open.

Cover your target
with the barrel,

then move with it
to get its pace.

I'm warning you, it's gonna be
frustrating the first times.

You're gonna shoot
under it or behind it.

You'll learn to stay with it.

Females are smarter
than the males,

but you know that...
It's like humans.

Females use their nose
to stay alive.

They make sure they have cover.

They always remember
they're trying to stay alive.

Bucks go off by themselves.

Bucks get dumb
during mating season.

Boys make too much noise.

Yes, they do.

I'm better than a boy, right?

Yes, you are.

John:
Hey.

I'll let you know when I hear
something that makes sense.

We don't even know
what this is yet.

Hey.
I, uh... I was inspired.

N-n-n-no, that one.

That one, before the pink
frock coat with the thorns.

That's supposed to be like a...
Like a tailored jacket,

but I'm gonna hand-print it
with newspaper headlines.

Woman: Well, I'm a simple
blouse-and-skirt person,

but these...

These are very artistic, Barry.

Just the kind of thing
Hamptons ladies

would spend $15,000 on
to wear once at a charity ball.

Shut up.

You know,
I-i can't stay too long.

This is... this is just a...
Just a visit.

Well, tell me what's going on.

What, you-you mean the e-mail?

Ah, just the usual things.

Just feelings
of being overwhelmed.

Well, the terseness
of your e-mail

made it sound specific
and time-related.

Are... are you looking
for something?

No.

No?
No, I'm just...

Just admiring.

I'm better now.
How's work?

It's great.

Well, when I last spoke to them,

they believed
you were a model employee.

They found you meticulous
and conscientious.

You know this, right?
I do.

Well, you've managed there
for ten years.

You're functioning very well,
Barry.

And it's a rare and wonderful
place for you to work.

Yes, it is.

You know, of all my other
clients with your disorder,

you've been the most consistent
at your job.

Did something happen, Barry?

How old are you?

Psh... just, the Internet
is inconsistent on this point.

Why is that on your mind?

Who's gonna look after us
when you retire or pass on?

Y-you know, we're gonna have
to take care of ourselves,

and nobody even believes
that we exist.

If ever something
were to happen to me,

I've made arrangements
with a colleague from Baltimore

to take over.

Hmm.

Hey, you, uh... you live alone?

You know this.

I'm sorry,
I just meant... how long?

Always.

That must be so lonely.

Uh, you know what?

I'm...

I'm doing much better.

I-I shouldn't have
e-mailed you.

I'm-I'm just...
Look at me.

I'm too impulsive.

By the way,
is anybody listening?

Does anybody care about us?

Yes.

The university of Paris
has asked me

to do a lecture, in fact.

I'm going to be doing it
via Skype from right here.

People are believing more.

Let's meet at our usual time
next week.

I would rather
you didn't leave, Barry.

Did something happen?

Don't worry.

This was just a visit.

I'm doing much better.
I actually...

Don't you want
your sketches, Barry?

You're usually
very protective of them.

Yeah.

Thanks.

Uh... I'll see you next week
at our usual time.

Thanks for fighting for us,
Dr. Fletcher.

Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.
Welcome.

I just think I'm gonna blow it.

No, you'll be great.

I'll see you next week.

Okay, thanks.
Okay.

Man:
In DJ's exclusive

million-dollar
holiday bucks bonanza.

I don't know how you work
with those people.

Hmm? What people?
Your patients.

Oh, you can't use your thumbs
to spin the wheel, dumbasses.

They always use their thumbs.

Oh.

W-well, we look at people
who've been shattered

and different as less than.

What if...

They're more than us?

What?

Do you believe them?

Your patients.

You know,
just between you and me.

Yes, I do.

Hmm.

Flick it. Flick it.

I don't believe it.

No? No.
No offense.

Woman:
But when you call,

we'll send you a second
easyfeet... -

absolutely free.

Just pay separate processing.
Oh.

So that's two easyfeet...

Now, that...
I need to buy that.

This young offer won't last...

Claire:
He's back.

Marcia:
There's a lady outside.

Woman:
Dennis, admit what you've done.

Dennis:
Don't get upset.

Woman:
Don't tell me.

I'm getting frightened.

I thought that you
had this under control.

Please tell me
it's not too late.

Dennis:
The food is waiting.

Woman:
Is she in that room?

We're here!
Help us!

Marcia: We're in here!
Woman: Dennis, what is this?

How many are there?
Dennis: N-n-no...

Don't go in there.
Don't go in there.

Don't worry.

I'll talk to him.

He listens to me.

He's not well.

He knows what you're here for.

He's not allowed to touch you.

He knows that.

Uh-uh.

Hmm?

Man:
<i>Karen.</i>

Dr. Fletcher:
<i>Joe.</i>

Joe:
<i>They said you can't have</i>

<i>your own panel
at the national conference.</i>

<i>They conceded, however,</i>

<i>that you can be part
of the mood disorder panel.</i>

Dr. Fletcher:
<i>It's not a mood disorder.</i>

Joe: <i>Oh, I'm aware
of your beliefs, Karen.</i>

Well, were they open this time
with the new evidence?

Joe: <i>One of your arguments
is a dog?</i>

You submitted video
of a dog acting differently

to one of your patients
at different times?

It is more dramatic than that.

<i>They are what
they believe they are.</i>

<i>The brain has learned
to defend itself.</i>

Joe: <i>You speak of them like
they're supernaturally gifted.</i>

Like... like they have
powers or something.

Karen, these are patients.

<i>They have been through trauma.</i>

And perhaps now, they are
capable of something we're not.

<i>We have brain scans now.</i>

<i>D.I.D. Patients have changed
their body chemistry</i>

<i>with their thoughts.</i>

He's just trying to scare us.

He was having a full
conversation with himself.

What was that line about...
"the food is waiting"?

Does everyone get
how wacked this is

and that we need to get
out of here now?

You... no.

Please keep your area neat.

The bathroom, it's unacceptable.

To make it easy,
I've color-coded these.

Use the blue bottle
f-for the floor

and the pink bottle
for the ceramic surfaces.

Uh...

Patricia has reminded me that...

I was sent to get you
for a reason.

That you are sacred food.

And I promise
not to bother you again.

Maybe he has a dog or something.

Think he's gonna feed us
to his dogs?

Claire:
<i>Casey.</i>

Casey!

My name's Hedwig.

I have red socks.

He's on the move.

What?

He's... on...

The... move.

Who?

Someone's coming for you,
and you're not gonna like it.

You guys make noises
in your sleep.

Tell us.

I'm not supposed to say.

But he's done awful things
to people,

and he'll do awful things
to you.

I have blue socks, too.

We're his food?

How old are you?

Nine.

So you're not the guy
that took us?

No.

You're not the lady?

What are you, blind?

You don't know how they think?

No, they don't...

They don't tell me much.

I just ate a hot dog.

Could you help us, Hedwig?

No, I'm... I'm not even
supposed to be here.

I stole the light
from Mr. Dennis,

but he'll be back real soon,
and...

I can't steal
the light for too long,

or he'll know and get angry.

Et cetera.

See ya!

Casey:
Wait.

We heard something.

We didn't understand it, but...

now we do.

Do you know what we heard?

What did you hear?

Come here.

I'll whisper it to you.

Okay.

Casey:
This guy...

is coming for you.

You're a big fibber.

I never lie, Hedwig.

But... but Mr. Dennis...

He said that he followed
those two girls for four days

and that he knew
that they were the ones

that-that-that he would want.

When you're not around,

Dennis and the lady talk
about it.

They talk about how he wants
a boy this time.

They're going to give him you.

N-no, miss... miss Patricia,
she said...

She said she's not mad
at me anymore.

Sh-she sings to me sometimes.

I think miss Patricia
is still a little mad at you.

Miss Patricia thinks I'm...

She thinks I'm stupid.

She... she thinks
I make silly mistakes.

Look at me.

We're like your babysitters.

We'll let you watch TV
and make you a fun dinner.

We all need to get out of here.

You could show us the way out.

We could be gone before
anybody gets back, but...

We have to hurry, Hedwig.

We have to hurry
and get out of here.

Wait... wait a minute.

It took forever
to get this place safe

without the nosey bodies
that work here finding out.

You can't get out of here.

I have to blow my nose.
No, no, wait. Please don't go!

Marcia:
Who's coming?

This is seriously scary.

No one's coming.

Casey:
He said something.

He said something
about making the room safe.

This is all new drywall.

What was unsafe?

Wait.

Wait, are we sure about this?

Casey, you were right.

There's something here.

He was covering up a way out.

Tell me if you see him.

Marcia:
Casey, tell us what you see.

Casey:
He's here.

You can't let him in.

You can't let him in.
This is our one chance.

Casey:
We're not gonna make it.

Claire:
Yes, we are.

Claire:
Oh, my...

What...?

Hey, what are you guys doing?

Hedwig:
Hey.

Okay, okay, quit it.

Okay, guys?
Let me... can you let me in?

Give us a second.
We're changing.

Hedwig:
What are you guys doing?

Let me in...

Guys, you're not being funny.

You're being bitches!
Now, I'm gonna slap you!

I'm gonna slap you
in your face and your...

Just give me as much time
as you can.

Hedwig:
You're gonna get...

You're gonna get me into
trouble.

Guys...

Casey:
Marcia.

Dennis:
Hey!

Hey!

Dennis: Hey!

I thought I lost you.

Would you, uh...

Would you step outside, please?

You like to make fun of us,

but we're more powerful
than you think.

Step outside.

Dennis:
Please.

Y-you shouldn't trick children.

That shows who you are.

Look at your sweater.
It's-it's ruined.

It's dirty.

Remove it.

I'm trying to be good.

You will not see
your friend again.

She will be kept separate.

And take off your skirt.

You take off your shirt.

Your clothes, you got all dirty
from the dust.

Dr. Fletcher:
One identity in an individual

with dissociative
identity disorder

can have high cholesterol.
One.

There have been cases
where one identity

is allergic to bee stings.

The others are not.

Are there moments
where two identities

can coexist at the same time?

There are times
when two identities

can take the light or the spot

or consciousness
at the same time.

This happened with a student
that I was working with.

And her left
and right hand were...

Were taking notes
in different handwritings

about separate things
at the same time.

The differences in the
identities can be dramatic.

As much as the difference
between you and me

and every person
in that auditorium.

The identities
have different IQ's.

They have different
physical strengths.

One personality
is a Russian weightlifter

and can lift three times
his body weight.

Their ability to hyper-focus

and have different experiences
is astounding.

Have these individuals,
through their suffering,

unlocked the potential
of the brain?

Is this the ultimate doorway

to all things we call unknown?

Is this where our sense
of the supernatural comes from?

It's about depth and, uh...

And-and curves and...

Hey, you see that one?

It's-it's kind of like
a chenille sweater-dress.

Who are you?

Barry.

I don't think you are.

I've developed a nose
for sensing

whom I'm talking to
and whom I'm not.

Have I done something?

You've e-mailed
for an unscheduled appointment

two days in a row.

We... we're just
feeling overwhelmed.

I... garden-variety issues.

I think Orwell or Jade
or Samuel or Heinrich

had the light for a moment
and e-mailed me.

And you're here to tell me
everything's okay.

I e-mailed you.

May I talk to one of them,
please?

That can't happen.

I... told them that I wanted

to spend the session
with you today.

I'm going to ask again.

To whom am I speaking with now?

Dr. Fletcher...

It's Barry.

It doesn't seem like Barry.

Barry is an extroverted leader.

Yes, I am.

I'm gonna take
a professional guess

based on the description
of all 23 identities

that live in Kevin's body
that I've gotten from Barry.

I think I'm talking to Dennis.

But he's been banned
from the light

because, among other reasons,

he has a proclivity to watch
young girls dance naked,

which he himself knows is wrong

and has fought against
with little success.

I'm encouraged
we can finally meet.

And I've guessed this
because you've adjusted

the chocolate dish twice
since you came in here,

and I understand you have OCD.

Oh, now I see.

Now I see. That's clever.

That's clever,
but I'm-I'm-I'm not Dennis.

And you and Patricia
have been banned from the light

for quite a while now.

Primarily, shall we say,
because of your beliefs.

Patricia and Dennis
are very unstable.

I'm not Dennis.

Have you both taken charge now?

Please believe me, I'm Barry.

You must forgive me. It's...

My job is to challenge you.

And, as you must know by now,
I have plenty of opinions

about how everyone
should live their lives.

You... a-ask me something
about fashion.

I'll prove it, or I'll...

Look, look, look, look.
Lindt.

Yeah, look.

You see? I'm not Dennis.

You want me to do
something else?

You got ice cream?

Oh, and this shirt's
a cotton blend anyway,

and the collar
is from three seasons ago.

Snood? I mean, come on.

Jai, what health-conscious
fast food purveyor

did you originally solicit
to buy these chicken wings

you've so lovingly reheated
in a minor suicidal gesture?

Hooters. And you can't just
throw them out, Dr. Fletcher.

Ah, this is wrong
on so many levels.

We finished about 3:15,
so look around 3:18.

You're getting a little soft

around the middle, jai.
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Fletcher:
The authors of Hooters

play on our incessant need
for fat

and man's incessant need
to be in the proximity

of augmented breasts.

It's like Henry v
ran a fast food franchise.

It's a good place,
Dr. Fletcher.

Right.

Jai: Hey, how'd you know
the trash would be spilled?

How can I say this, jai?

You're not the most meticulous
of people.

This guy isn't very neat, is he?

He walked right
through the trash.

No, jai.

Any normal person
would have walked around it.

That was an act.

What are you up to, Dennis?

Or is it Patricia
who's deciding things?

Marcia:
<i>We're not gonna die.</i>

<i>Bad things happen.</i>

<i>But not like this.</i>

Casey...

Talk to me.

We need to get to a window
or a door or something.

Don't you think?

The thrill, Casey,
is about whether you can

or can't outsmart this animal.

See, you didn't used to like
to come out here.

This is like
our family tradition, right?

Good shot, big brother.

Thank you, John.

I have your meal, sleepyhead.

Eat.

It's good?

It's got paprika in it.

Mmm.

I'm sorry.

I think I'll put
a pretty flower in your hair.

There we are.

That's to show
how important you are.

Come along.

We'll have a proper meal.

I understand, this must all seem

so unsatisfactory for you.

But we are doing
the best we can.

Good?

Mm-hmm?

Can Claire come eat with us?

No.

No, I'm afraid
that can't happen.

She almost ruined
our big reception.

Mmm.

I've heard that Asian people's
music aids digestion.

Hmm.

I'll make you a second sandwich.

Do you know...

A family of lions
can eat 35 pounds a day?

A buck can lose 30%
of its weight

during mating season
chasing does around.

They're crepuscular, right?

Means they travel around
during dusk and dawn.

Good for you.

It's crooked.

I... forgive me.

I don't know if you know,
but tigers have only 30 teeth.

That's 12 less than a dog.

I thought that was a fun fact.

Casey:
No!

Go to your room.

Shut the door. Do it now.

In the sun,

we will find our passion.

In the sun,

we will find our purpose.

You've always been protected.

You've never truly suffered.

And that's why we chose you.

You've always been asleep.

You never had a chance.

Shh.

You never had a chance.

Dennis: The dark-haired girl,

she's gonna be kept
in another closet.

I... you might as well know
at this point.

The beast...

He's coming for you.

All three of you,
you're gonna be kept separate.

Y-y-you've got...

You've got a... you've got
a crumb on your shirt.

You've got...

Please take it off.

Just...

Just take it off.

Hey.

Hedwig: It wasn't nice what
you said about miss Patricia.

You lied.

I'm sorry about that, Hedwig.

You guys lied to me,

made me scared, et cetera.

Mr. Dennis, he says
you wear a lot of shirts.

I like this shirt.

Thank you.

Do you know who Dennis
and miss Patricia are?

Casey:
No.

See, every one of us
has to wait in a chair,

and Barry, he decides
who stands in the light.

But Barry lost that power
because of me.

I can wish myself
into the light any time I want.

It's a... it's a special power.

Barry just has to keep sitting
in his chair if I want him to.

That's why Dennis
and miss Patricia

said I could be with them.

Dennis and miss Patricia,
they believe in the beast

and what he can do.

Have you seen him?

The... beast?

N-no.

Can I kiss you?

I wanted to kiss the other girl
with the dark hair,

but she's in trouble.

So, do you want to?
I mean, I don't know much

about kissing, though.
Yeah.

Okay.

Uh, okay, here we go.

I'm so nervous.

One, two...

Three.

You might be pregnant now.

Am I a good kisser?

Yeah.

I like dancing.

Do you like dancing?

I-I... I like dancing
to my Cd player in my room.

Kanye west is my main man.

I... we got my...
My Cd player set up in my...

My room right-right...
Right next to my window.

I'm like...

I'm... mmm.

Mmm. Mmm.

We gots the moves.
Wow.

Hey, maybe I could
watch you dance

and listen to music with you.

No, my music's in my room.

Oh, right.

Maybe...
Yeah?

You could sneak me there.

Are you trying to trick me?

Et cetera?

I'll tell on you.

Hey...
I'm-I'm telling on you.

I'll tell you something.

And you can tell me
if I'm lying or not, okay?

Mm-hmm.
Like a test.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Okay?

I get into trouble at school
on purpose.

So I can get sent to detention.

To get away...

From everyone.

So that I can be alone.

Okay, I'll show you
something cool in my room.

Okay.

But after Mr. Dennis

has finished
his getting-ready ritual.

I have to go.

He's got an appointment.

Wh-when I fall asleep,
one of the others

keeps trying to reach
the doctor lady to tell on us.

Barry: That pant, it's got
a... it's got a red lining.

You can see it in the long slit
down the side.

Dr. Fletcher:
We've been talking about

silk-and-wool blend
for 20 minutes.

Well, can I guess
that you e-mailed me

in the middle of the night
for an emergency session

due to garden-variety issues?

I was down, and I e-mailed you.

And I woke up,
and I feel better.

I-I feel better.

I had a thought.

Uh-uh.

I want to talk
about the incident at work.

It's okay, Barry.

You're safe.

I just want to bring
the details back.

We'll just talk
about the details.

A high school
from Camden, New Jersey

was on a field trip
at your place of work,

and two young ladies
came up to you.

And one took your hand

and put it under her shirt
on her breast,

and the second one did the same.

And then they just ran off
laughing to their friends.

You surmised
that it might be on a dare.

You said they were 17 or 18.

You said it upset you for days.

It was just a teenage prank.

I-I get that now.

And see, that's my mistake.

I believe that I went over this
incident with you too fast.

Although you said you were fine

and the other identities
I met with said it was fine,

I believe that this
brought up issues

from when you
were a child and abused.

Sometimes another incident
of abuse

can cause suppressed
personalities

to take the light.

Dennis, if this is you,
I completely understand

why you felt the need

to take over
and protect the others.

Please.

Doctor, not this again.

The others told me
that you and Patricia

told the group about this beast.

And I told them that these
are just scary stories

that Dennis and Patricia
tell the others to scare them.

How this beast
can crawl on walls

like the best rock climbers,
using the slightest friction

and imperfections
to hold his body close

to seemingly sheer surfaces.

How his skin is thick and tough
like the hide of a rhinoceros.

Do you really believe
the stories about the beast?

Hmm.

If this is you, Dennis,

I understand
why Kevin needs you.

You are strong and disciplined,

you are precise,

and you will not
be taken advantage of.

You can trust me.

For example,
I do have the ability

to use Kevin's full name
and bring him forward

as he has in the past.

But I wouldn't do that.

I know that that
would be chaos for all of you.

Everyone would grab the light.

I don't want
to hurt any of you that way.

You don't have to hide.

I know you are someone
who cares for Kevin.

You are not evil to me.

You were necessary.

Dennis, is that you?

They keep calling us
"the horde."

The others, you know?

Miss Patricia and I,
we are ridiculed.

Now, we're not perfect,

but we don't deserve
to be ridiculed.

We're all struggling.

They have to admit that.

I am pleased to meet you,
Dennis.

You, too.

I assume you don't know
who e-mailed me

for the emergency sessions?

One of the others.

Are you in charge?

Yeah, we've taken charge.

We're the only ones
that can protect Kevin.

We're all here to protect Kevin.

He's very weak.

He doesn't know
how powerful we can be.

Would you mind telling me when
you first came into existence?

And how you and Patricia,

the other undesirable identity,
became aligned?

That's okay.

Do you still have
strong beliefs?

That depends on what.

This story of the beast.

One thing, Dennis,
that may comfort you

if you are confused

is that you've met
the other alters.

You're all in a room
in chairs, right?

Mmm, yeah.

But you never met the beast.

Because he doesn't reside
with the rest of you.

Because he resides
in the train yard,

as the story goes,

because Kevin's dad left
on a train.

But the fact is you and Patricia

have never met the beast.

Have you?

No.

That's because
he's not an alter.

He's not the 24th identity.

He's a fantasy.

Hurry up. Let's go.

Come on. It's time.

Shh.

Shh, shh.

Wow.

I know.

This is your Cd player?

Yeah.

You don't like it?

It's... it's not new or...
No.

No, I'm just, uh...

I'm-I'm confused.

You said it was near a window.

Oh, that's here.

Watch.

Now it's closed.

Now it's open.

Now it's closed.

Now it's open.

Did you think
it was a real window?

So you could leave, et cetera?

Help me get out of here, Hedwig.

I...

Just get me the keys
and let me out the door.

Please.

Miss Patricia says that nobody

will make fun of me anymore
when the beast comes.

She says that everyone
will see how amazing I am,

and then all
of the silly mistakes,

they won't matter anymore.

I-I-i think you should go
back to your room.

No! Wait, please.
Ow!

I want to hear
your Kanye west albums.

Ow.
Show me your room.

Let's stay here.

I'm sorry I asked to leave.
I can't.

You said you wanted to show me
something cool, right? -No.

Show me something.
I don't want to.

Please.
I...

This!

Oh, wow.

It's nice.

It's not a toy.

This is real?

Yes.

It's Mr. Dennis's.

He doesn't even know I stole it.

Pretty cool, right?

You can listen
to people talking,

and they don't even know
you're listening.

Who does this talk to?

Don't touch that.

I just want to see if it works.

Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

Don't touch those buttons.
You're gonna get us found out.

Man: Yeah, east gate here. What up?
You gonna... shit.

Don't talk.

Man: What up?
Don't talk.

Hello?

I'm gonna slap you!
No!

Man: Who's this?

Hello. Hello.
My name is Casey Cooke.

I'm being held in a basement.

I've been abducted
with two other girls.

Man:
Who the hell is this?

Man:
Hello?

Casey Cooke.

I've been abducted.

You need to find me.

Man:
Betty, is that you?

This isn't funny.

Casey:
Call the police.

I must be near you.

I'm being held
in a basement or something.

Man:
Okay, Betty, listen.

Tell Larry and fish I said hi.

Tell him I still got
his orange headphones and...

I don't know where I am.

There's a man here.

He abducted us,
and he's going to kill me.

I only have a few hours left.

Casey: Please.

Casey:
I'm begging you.

Somebody save us.

Man:
Wait, who is this?

And how did you get one
of our walkies?

Patricia: Put your hands
together in contrition.

In the sun,

we will find our passion.

In the sun,

we will find our purpose.

I read that on a sympathy card
in a supermarket.

It was for funerals,
but I thought it was beautiful.

Dennis will explain the meaning
of this evening.

The beast is a sentient creature

who represents the highest form
of human's evolution.

He believes the time
of ordinary humanity is over.

I hope this makes you feel calm.

You will be in the presence
of something greater.

I was gonna ask
for your last shirt, but...

But I won't.

Because tonight
is a sacred night.

It's almost over.

Casey.

Come on.

Let's pretend
we're animals again.

Come on.

Casey, come on.

This is our game.

I'll tell your dad
you're not being nice.

Come on, take off your stuff.

Animals don't wear clothes.

Come on.

Yeah, yeah.

Come on.

Hey, Casey bear.

This isn't funny.

Is it loaded?

Casey...

I'm your uncle.

Stop it, Casey.

Put that gun down.

I'm getting upset.

I'm about to get very angry.

Give me the gun!

Could've killed me.

Th-this place is closed.

No, it's-it's okay.
You can't get in.

Dr. Fletcher:
No, it's okay.

Hello, Dennis.

One of the others
e-mailed me just now.

Is everything okay?
We're fine.

Dennis, Kevin is really lucky
to have you.

You are quite extraordinary.

I just don't want you guys
to get hurt.

You think we're extraordinary?

I like you, Dennis.

May I come in?

And can we talk?

I know you want
to tell me something.

Why don't you just tell me?

Dennis:
We're very similar, you and I.

Both on the outside, looking in.

Please, sit.

I don't get many visitors.

Uh...
I'll get you some water.

They got a proper quarters
for me in a building

on the south side,
but we prefer it here.

When they promoted me
to head of maintenance,

they said I could have it.

Dr. Fletcher:
Who are you going to meet?

Dennis:
I want to talk about...

Kevin and...

What his mother did to him.

I remember it all.

I'm happy
you're suddenly so open.

Kevin's mother
had rather malevolent ways

of punishing a three-year-old.

Is that when you arrived
in the light?

Yeah.

The one way
to avoid her attention

was to keep everything
spotless, everything perfect.

I know you're coming
from good intentions, Dennis,

but there are other ways
to help Kevin now.

I've lost so many patients
into the system.

I want you to know, Dennis,

I will never stop fighting
for you.

My patients
have become my family.

They are what I've chosen

instead of
a more traditional path.

I hope you feel you can be
truly honest with me.

I actually want
to be honest with you.

I lied before.

When you asked if I'd ever
met the beast,

I said no.

That really isn't true.

You wrote about a woman
in Germany

who'd been blind for ten years.

And then it was discovered
that she had d.I.D.

Then three of her identities
developed sight.

And you speculated
that her optical nerves

regenerated
because of her beliefs.

What are you trying to say?

There are things, Dr. Fletcher,

that all of us
would find hard to believe.

Are you trying to tell me
there's a 24th identity?

You protect the broken.

When you said that you thought

this situation
was extraordinary,

I knew you can maybe understand.

Understand what?

The beast...

Is real.

He's just emerged.

You were right about everything.

What does he look like?

He's much bigger than I am,

and I'm the biggest
of all of us.

He's tall.

He's very muscular.

And he's got
a long mane of hair,

and his fingers are...
Are twice the length of ours.

He believes
we are extraordinary.

That we don't represent
a mistake, but our potential.

You say the same things.

He's on the move.

What does that mean?

I don't understand.

He can't be real.

There must be limits to what
a human being can become.

And there's another whole part
of the story, isn't there?

About the eating
of the impure young?

What does "impure" even mean?

Well, we should discuss that

so that you can
understand fully.

Understand what?

Sometimes...

there's just no other way.

Who are you going to meet?

Him.

You know what?

I would love to take notes
on all of this.

We should probably discuss this
in a proper session tomorrow.

Really?

You're okay with this?

This has been so wonderful...
You being so open.

I can see that you feel
very empowered

by the philosophies
of the beast.

I...
I'm going to go now.

I knew you would understand.

I'll see you.

Dr. Fletcher:
Would you mind...

if I used your bathroom?

No.

It's down the hall,
near the stairs, on your left.

Dennis:
How we doing?

I'm okay.

Are you real?

Marcia:
Who is it?

Help me.

Help me.
Marcia: Is someone there?

Oh, my...
Claire: Help me.

Please help me.

They will never reach
their potential.

They don't really matter.

Listen to me, Dennis.

I should've listened better.

I should've understood
what you're capable of,

how powerful you are.

Patricia says
your way isn't working.

The world will understand now.

Dennis,
this is an egregious wrong.

These young women are suffering.

This is a crime.

I can't let you keep them here.

We've gotta stop this.

This identity is monstrous.

I'm really sad
you feel this way.

Can't you see?
He is formed

because of your time
in this place.

Claire:
There's a lady.

Someone's here.

We need to get out
of these rooms.

Is there anything in your room?

Anything that we could use?

Claire:
There's nothing in here.

There's a hanger.

Thank you, Dennis.

Here you go, sir.

It sounded like
there were slide bolts

on the outside of our doors.

See if you can move the lock
through the crack in the door.

Claire:
Stay calm.

We're getting out of here.

We're gonna get Casey.

Claire:
You can do this, Marcia.

With regard
to Chahamana's defeat

and Muhammad of Ghor's conquests

between 1192 and 1200,

I would liken it
to Muhammad's brazen ultimatum

that Prithviraj
either apostatize or fight.

Like Prithviraj's defiance,

we should stand up
to the horde's advances.

In the face
of their scare tactics,

we should show...

I hate my Insulin shots.

No one else around here
has to take them.

Why do I have to have diabetes?

All the doctors,
besides Dr. Fletcher,

say that we're the same person.

Just personalities, huh?

How do you explain
I'm the only one

that needs these,
you motherfu...

Barry: I'm wearing cargo pants
from the '90s.

And a scarf.

If it wasn't for the Varvatos
t-shirt underneath,

I'd be a mess.

I got no taste
for things right now.

<i>I'm worried sick.</i>

<i>I have a very bad feeling
that I'm losing time.</i>

I decide who gets the light,
right?

I think someone
is stealing the light from me

when I'm not aware.

<i>The horde keeps obsessing about
the ones who haven't suffered.</i>

<i>I don't know where
they're going with this,</i>

<i>but it scares me.</i>

Claire: Picture yourself
in a couple hours at home.

On the couch,

in that ugly-ass sweatshirt
that you love.

Jesus. It's an animal!

He goes like this if there's
a coyote or something.

K-Kevin. Kevin.

Kev... Kev...

Thank you...

For helping us till now.

Kev... Kev...

Barry:
<i>I guess I should tell</i>

<i>Dr. Fletcher
about this, but...</i>

She'll worry.

She's such a sweet woman.

I believe I will go
for a nice walk

and think this through
organizationally.

Thus ends my journal for Monday.

Ciao.

Claire.

Marcia.

Claire.

Claire, let's go.

Casey:
"Kevin Wendell crumb."

Casey:
Kevin Wendell crumb?

Kevin Wendell crumb.

Kevin Wendell crumb!

Woman:
<i>Kevin Wendell crumb.</i>

Kevin Wendell crumb...

You made a mess.

Come out here.

Kevin Wendell crumb!

You made a mess!

Get out here!

Who are you?

Wh-what's happening?

Something horrible.

What'd I do?

Did I hurt you?

Dr. Fletcher. Dr. Fletcher.

Who did that?

You did.

I swear I was on a bus.

I don't remember anything
after that.

I...

This is still
September 18, 2014, right?

There's a shotgun I bought.

It's in the bottom cabinet,
hidden behind things.

The shells are in
my uniform closet

out in the service hall.

Kill me.

Then kill me.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no!

Don't do that. Don't do that.

He can't handle reality.

My name is Jade.

Has Dr. Fletcher
been getting our e-mails?

This is what we have to do.
We can...

As in 1008,

when Anandapala suffered the
Shahis' most crushing defeat

and Mahmud overran the entirety
of the Punjab region,

taking the famed temple
of Kangra,

we have been wronged
by this alliance,

this horde of Patricia,
Dennis and the boy.

Their actions
do not represent us.

They... are every...

Everybody, just take a minute!

Oh, baby girl.

They've been stealing control
of the light from me,

but the group are gonna work
through this.

Honey, my name is Barry.

Hedwig: You shouldn't have used
the walkie-talkies.

They almost caught us.

Stop it, Hedwig.

Oh, they were right.
Look at you.

You're so frightened of us.

Dennis and miss Patricia
are in charge because of me.

I'm gonna give the light
to them now.

No one's allowed
to make fun of me anymore.

Patricia:
Thank you, Hedwig.

Everything's fine now.

Kevin Wendell crumb.

Kevin is asleep.

We've made him sleep far away.

You can call his name
all you like, dear, but...

He's not going to hear you.

The beast has shared
with us his dream

of a larger group
to sustain him.

No.

Ten to twelve unworthy young
next time.

No. No...

This is just the start.

No. No.

Okay. Okay.

Let go!

Help!

No! No!

No.

It runs in our family.

My daddy died, too.

Same way... heart attack.

But you don't need to worry.

I'm going to take care of you.

Now...

You won't be giving me
any trouble, will you?

John:
<i>I know you won't, sweetie.</i>

Beast:
We are glorious!

We will no longer be afraid!

Only through pain...

Can you achieve your greatness!

The impure are the untouched,

the unburned, the unslain.

Those who have not been torn

have no value in themselves

and no place in this world.

They are asleep.

All right...

Your gun cannot hurt me.

Can't you see I am not human?

Kevin is a man.

I am much more.

You... y-you are
different from the rest.

Your heart is pure.

Rejoice!

The broken are the more evolved.

Rejoice.

What in the name
of Mary and Joseph?

What are you doing in this area?

Just keep walking, honey.

They won't do nothing.

Vince, call the police.

She said some people got hurt
in the area below maintenance.

Okay.

Now, I'm just gonna check you.

Man: Third deceased...
Name of Dr. Karen Fletcher.

Still trying
to locate the family.

Woman:
Casey Cooke's guardian's here.

Your uncle's here.

You ready to go?

Dennis:
It didn't go through.

We are what we believe we are.

Hedwig:
Holy shit.

This is so cool!

Ah!

They're gonna believe
we exist now, right?

Dennis:
They're gonna have to.

Hedwig:
So what do we do now?

Patricia:
We trust in him.

He'll protect us.

Look...

At what he can do.

Let him show the world
how powerful we can be.

Female reporter: <i>The suspected
murderer Kevin crumb</i>

suffers from the controversial
psychological disorder d.I.D.

The rumors coming out of the
scene are almost unbelievable.

There are conflicting stories
if the suspect is alive or dead

after sustaining
two point-blank gunshots.

Reports even indicate one
of his personalities

is an amalgam
of the various animals

in the Philadelphia zoo
where he worked.

The press is already referring

to the alleged attacker
by a dark name,

leaked by a source
close to the case.

Because of his many
personalities,

he is being called "the horde."

This is like that crazy guy
in the wheelchair

that they put away 15 years ago.

And they gave him
a funny name, too.

What was it?

Mr. glass.

Oh, yeah.
