I'll be right there!


[breathing heavily]

Hey, something's burning.

Oh.

Ow! Damn it.

isn't for another two months.

I know that.

I can make you
pancakes if I want to.

I'm good.

Please don't do that.

Uh-huh.

[phone chiming]

Who's that?

Have you seen my mug?

The one with the
sunflowers on it.

Do you need money for school?

I'm gonna be late.

[chiming continues]

[door opens, shuts]

gone for the pancakes.

And given her the satisfaction?

So when'd you start
sleeping on the couch?

No, I just keep on passing out
in front of the TV.

I mean,
not that I blame you.

Pretty shitty thing,
what she did.

Hey, hey.
None of that.

So, what, you getting
into fights now?

They were being assholes.

That's no excuse.

Look...

I know things between
your mom and me...

Has nothing to do with this.

So how'd the other kid look?

The other two kids.

One of them cried.

[phone ringing]

Yeah?


<i>I didn't want to
wake you earlier.</i>

<i>There are pancakes...</i>

Is that why you're calling?

<i>Well, I also wanna talk.</i>

I already ate.
I'll see you later.

<i>Greg...</i>

[phone beeps]

[dog barks]

Are you fucking kidding me?

[door creaking]

Jesus Christ, Connor.

your nine o'clock is here.

Justin Whitter, 10 years old.

Went missing on a bike ride
last night near Troubadour Park.

Park ranger
found the bike, no boy.

Just like Michael King?

No, we don't know if
the two are connected.

Michael King was abducted

cycling to a corner store
in the city.

Justin Whitter, local boy.
Good home, respected family.

He went missing on county lines,

but as of nine o'clock
this morning

the case was ruled ours.

Does Spitz know about this?

It's up to him if
he wants to get involved.

He'll wanna get involved.

I'll let you manage the
situation as you see fit.

You're lead on this.

Got it.


[door closes]


Connor?

Connor?

[screams, gasps]
Whoa! Whoa.

I'm just a window repairman.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

What are you doing here?
Your husband called about a broken window.

Just finished putting
in a new one for you.

Oh, my God.


Just give me a jingle if you
have any problems with it,

and have a good day.

Thank you.

I'm sorry, who let you in?

That kid of yours.
Very polite.

You trained her well.
[phone ringing]

Who?

And the truth is,
anything you find

could be important.

Justin was last seen wearing a
green soccer jersey and carrying...

Gonna want answers, and fast.

So the kid's riding his bike
all alone through the woods.

The parents are okay with that?

Figure he's old enough.

You know, really.

Mom, dad, two happy kids.

Perfect all-American family.
[phone ringing]

Yeah.

Aren't they all?

Lisa and I went through
that rough patch last year.

Hey, come on, Spitz.

Look,

I'm not saying I know anything.

Just there was this counselor.

Jackie is a counselor.

We'll be fine.

There's something up here!

[shutter clicks]

All right, step away.
What you got?

Jesus Christ.

should we bring it in?

Yeah.
Yeah, you can...

You can bag it.

Thanks, Kayla.

Spitz.

You okay?

You remember Cole Gordon?
It was before your time.

Oh, of course I remember.

The green knives.

Six boys.

All found buried
with those knives.

Yeah, I know.

But Gordon, he's...

Yeah, yeah,
I helped put him there,

and he ain't getting out.

So what're you thinking?


Could you pass the dressing?

Thank you.

Hey, did you let a repairman in
today when I wasn't here?

Jesus, Mom,
is that who it was?

Did you screw a repairman?

Okay.

Okay, you're angry.

How could you do that?

How could you do that to Dad?

Who was it?

Just someone, sweetie...

Oh, you don't get
to call me that.

You don't ever get
to call me that again.

I see how mad you are.

You don't get to act
like nothing happened!

You think pancakes and fancy
dinners are gonna make it up?

No, I don't... You ruined our family
and you should fucking pay for it!

[volume turning down] <i>...that

Oh, I didn't
hear you pull in.

I tried calling you a bunch.

How was your day?

You broke a window?

I called and reported
that repairman they sent out.

I think he stole from us.

You what?

All of our silverware
is completely gone.

Look in the drawer.

He said something strange about
some girl who was helping...

Why would he take our
shitty silverware?

I don't know, Greg,
but it's not there.

His boss is gonna
look into it.

I don't know what's
wrong with you.

[female reporter] <i>So tell us a little
bit about your son, Mrs. Whitter.</i>

[Mrs. Whitter] <i>His name is Justin.
Justin Whitter.</i>

<i>He's 10 years old.</i>

<i>Um... He's very excited
about starting fifth grade.</i>

<i>He rides his bike all over this
neighborhood all the time.</i>

<i>So it's really normal for him to
ride his bike home from school.</i>

<i>Everybody in the
neighborhood knows him.</i>

<i>He's just a
really great kid.</i>

Hey.
How'd you get in here?

Come here.

Where are you going?

Come on.

Yeah, this is your room,
but, no, not in there.

Hey, come on.

Come on.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

[door thudding]

Connor?

Connor, come on.

You're hilarious,
but let me out now.

Connor?

Connor, open the door!

Open the door. I'm serious!

Connor, open this door!

Connor!

What're you doing?

What are you doing?

I heard pounding,
so I came up the...

Where's Connor?

He's out.

What?

[footsteps approaching]

Anything?

No.

Do you wanna call the station?

You know, maybe I'm just tired.

Why don't you sleep
upstairs tonight?

Yeah, I'm gonna move some
stuff into the guest room.

I know you can't
just forgive me.

I don't expect you to,
I really don't.

But I want you to know I'll do
whatever it takes to make...

Did you wanna get married?

What?
What do you mean?

A shitty cop making shitty pay,
this out-of-towner who your parents hated.

My parents didn't hate you.
Your dad hated me

'cause he knew I wouldn't
provide for you like he did,

like he did with
this fucking house.

I never needed you
to provide for me.

I never wanted that.

I wanted that.

You really think we'd still be together
if you hadn't gotten pregnant?

I'm glad things worked out
the way they did.

I'm trying, Greg.

I was thirsty.

It's a little late to be playing video games,

I'm taking you
to school tomorrow.

What? Why?

Doesn't matter,
I'm just taking you.

I'm not gonna
get kidnapped, Mom.

Oh, my God, I haven't
seen him in forever.

Hippie. Remember him?

No.

Mom.

Good night.

[phone ringing]

Hello.

<i>Davis wants to see us. Now.</i>

Yeah, okay.
I'll be right there.

Sorry.

What'd I miss?


A closed case.
I got pulled out of bed for this.

You know why you're here, Spitz.

The MO is an exact match

of a serial child abductor
you put away 15 years ago.

I was on the phone with your old
partner while you were all tucked up.

They sent what they
still had on hand.

Jesus Christ.
Put that shit away.

Gordon's defense
attorney's trying to use it

to build a case for a mistrial.

They didn't waste any time.

I'm sorry to disappoint
the dickhead lawyer,

but Gordon was a
convicted pedophile

with a trunk packed
full of those knives,

not to mention clothes from half a dozen
of the victims we found at his house.

it's probably a copycat.

But we need to get
in front of this.

I sent Larson to track down the two
boys that escaped, Braun and Travers.


but they might remember details now</i>

<i>that could help impede
Gordon's defense.</i>

I wasn't wrong.

I interviewed both those boys
extensively when it happened.

There's no doubt.
No doubt.

Then why'd you end up
with us, Ray?

Get his address.

He's locked away.</i>

knowledge he is, Mr. Braun.

But we'd like to talk
to your son, if that's possible.

[Mr. Braun] He's out back.

Tommy.

Tommy?

There's some nice men
here to see you.

[breathing heavily]


Remember me?

Officer Spitzky.

It's been
a long time, Tommy,

but I still have that
brontosaurus you gave me.

Tommy?


No, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no!

No! No! No!

No! No!

No!


[Spitz, on recording]
<i>Hey, Tommy.</i>

<i>Tommy?</i>

<i>Can you start
at the beginning for me?</i>

<i>I need you to answer
my questions, okay?</i>

<i>I know you're scared.</i>

[young Tommy]
<i>There was a man.</i>


<i>Someone you knew?</i>

[young Tommy]
<i>No, but he said he knew us.</i>

<i>Where did you see him?</i>

[young Tommy]
<i>Watching us on the tracks.</i>

to your face, Tommy?</i>

[young Tommy]
<i>I did it to myself.</i>

<i>After the little house
in the trees.</i>

<i>Is that where he took you?</i>

<i>Do you think you can
remember where it is?</i>

[young Tommy]
<i>It's not there anymore.</i>

<i>It's a magic house.
It disappears.</i>

<i>What does that mean?</i>

[young Tommy] <i>It means...
you're never gonna find him.</i>

[cell phone chimes]


Hey.

What are you doing here?

I took the bus out
this morning.

I'm staying with a college
buddy in Braxfield.

Did you not get my messages?

You cannot be here.
My son is here.

Well, let's go somewhere.
Take the day off work.

It's so good to see you.
No, no, no, no.

Did you not get my texts?

Did I freak you out by what I said last time?
No.

Because that was a whole different...
Because I'm in love with you!

I'm in love with you,
Jackie.

I can't...

I don't want to be with you.

Jackie, listen.
I know you're scared.

Todd, stop! I'm scared too.
But what we have, you know...


Ow!
Oh, my God.

Ow. What the hell?

Jesus.
Let me see.

No, no,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

I'm fine.
I gotta sit down.

No, no, come with me.
Come with me.

Okay. All right, honey.
I'm good.

Oh, my God.

What the fuck?

[faucet running]

[faucet stops]


Jackie.
Careful.

This reminds me of high school.
Remember?

Sneaking into your parents'
basement all those times.


Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What? Okay.

Ow. Whoa.

Whoa.
This is like...

Come here.

hurts a little bit.

Come here.
Oh, nice. [groans]

This is great. Yeah.

Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

Be careful.

[muffled voices, indistinct]

Mom?

Honey, you'd make
an amazing nurse.

Oh, ow! Fuck.

Oh.

As soon as Connor
goes to school,

I think I should take you
to the hospital.

[phone ringing]
Yeah, that sounds great.

You're calling me.

Where's your phone?
What're you talking about?

Where's your phone?

[guitar playing on phone]
Hello?

Hello?

Did you leave
your phone somewhere?

[phone chiming]

["A Man at the Frontier" by Marc Morvan,
Ben Jarry playing]

[music stops]

Did you turn this on?

No.

Were you just up on the roof?

What?
No, what're you talking about?

You said you were
taking me to school.

I am.

Is something wrong?

Get in the car.
I'll be right there.

Connor, if you did something,
if you were upset...

What're you talking about?

You can tell me.
I won't be mad.

I just want...
Mom!

[tires screech]

Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Harper.

No, Mrs. Whitter,
I'm so sorry for your son...

Has he heard anything?
Your husband?

I-I... I'm not sure.

I know they're doing
everything they can.

My son is
out there somewhere.

They're gonna find him.

Greg is going to find him.

Yeah.

Thanks.



You think he knew him?

What?

Justin Whitter.

Chances are
he knew the kidnapper.

Maybe.

No, think about it.

Kid's on his bike.

Sees the perp.
They know each other.

So the kids stops.

He grabs him,

drops one of the knives
to throw us off.

Spitz?
Maybe.

Or...

He stops the kid.

Sorry it took so long,
I didn't...


[water dripping]

[door opens, closes]

[breathes heavily]

Help me.

Jesus Christ, Jackie.
Walk me through what happened.

Everything.
We were talking.

[breath shudders]

Yes, we were talking
by the side of the house.

I explained that we were over,

and out of nowhere
it just fell.

It was bleeding,
but it wasn't like that.

Why didn't you call an ambulance?
Is there anyone you can call?

Why didn't you call an ambulance?
It was Connor.


What?

He was upstairs.

He's been so angry.

So angry.

So angry he tried
to kill someone.

Maybe it was an accident?
Jesus Christ, Jackie.

I don't know
what's happening...

No, no! You don't get
to lose it right now!

Listen to me.

Do you know...

what will happen to our son?

I won't be able to protect him.

Go change out of those clothes.

[dog barking]

[video game sound effects]

[shovel clattering]

Okay.

[body thuds]


[video game sound effects]

[metal clinking]

[shovel clattering]

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.


[computer chimes]

[engine turns off]

[door opens]

[Jackie screams]
Jackie!

[no audible dialogue]

Drive straight to the hospital.
Don't stop for anything.

I'll call you when
I'm on my way.

I'll find him, Jackie! I'm gonna find
the son of a bitch who did this.

Drive.

[tires squealing]

Spitz. 911 dispatch
just got a call from someone

claiming to have
seen our kidnapper.

No shit. Where?

They're tracking
GPS signal now.

And Harper's not
answering his cell.

I can pick him up.

["A Man at the Frontier" by Marc Morvan,
Ben Jarry playing]

[music continues]


[girl, boy laughing]

Did you get that on camera?

gonna happen. I was so close.

Hell yeah!

Holy shit.

You see this view?


I don't think I've ever seen
a view this nice before.


What the hell?

Hey, don't break anything.

I wasn't planning on it.


They have "Battlestar"?

Look at all that wine.

Bet they're alcoholics.

Jesus.

They take so many pictures.

Creepy mom.

It just keeps going
and going.

It has, like, actual wings.

They got you locked up.


Hey, check it out.
I found our room!

Guest room, baby.

This is the life.


What the...

These sheets are covered
in, like, a layer of dust.

It's a fucking sandstorm,
Jesus.

Do these people
not have friends?

sleep somewhere out of sight?

I did.

Let me take you
to our sleeping quarters.

And at night...

we are going to sleep in here.

Ta-da.

fucking kidding me.

I'm not.

[Alec sighs]

[camera beeps]

Okay.

Okay.

So,

I should probably tell you a little
bit about what we're doing. Um...

So this is a documentary.
Yeah. Um...

It's to give you all a look at how a
professional phrog goes about phrogging.

They call us phrogs
with a "P-H"

because we hop
from pad to pad

undetected by the people
who actually live in the house.

Usually I try to stay in a place for no
longer than, like, four or five days

'cause it makes it harder
to be discovered.

For the most part, I really try to disrupt
their lives as little as possible.

Oh, and it's a good thing that
these people have a guest room.

That's what you wanna look for.

A room that is rarely used by the
family that you can make headquarters.

As you can see,

I'm eating some of their food.

Um, this is allowed
because, you know,

um... a girl's gotta eat.

We just try not to take
too much of one thing.


You asshole!
Alec!

This disturbing creature is my cameraman,
Alec. [laughing]

I can't believe you brought
this creepy thing with you.

What? It's fitting.
We're phrogs.

It's a frog.
You're such a freak.

He has never done this before,
so I'm showing him the ropes

while he documents
with his nifty camera.

Oh, I also let him
pick out this house.

And I sure know how
to pick 'em, huh?

So far, so good.

This is
the best part of the day.

We get to be loud,
and we have the house to ourselves

and we can
move about freely.

But when they come home,

we have to stick
to our hiding places

and stay quiet.

And that part's gonna suck.

Yep.

[camera beeps]


It is ten minutes
after 2:00 a.m.

Alec and I fell asleep,

and the family must've come home
while we were passed out.

Alec, are you awake?

Alec? Alec?

[camera beeps]

Alec?

What the hell are you doing?


outside whenever you want.





he saw me. He waved.

Come on. Get back inside.

[camera beeps]


And here we go.


[static crackles]

[knife clinks]



You trying to set off
a smoke alarm?

Yes.
Stay away from the window.

God, who knew this phrogging thing would
give you such a stick up your ass?

Shh! Hushed voices.

Sorry.

Dude, I don't think you
understand how dangerous this is.

We could go to jail. We're breaking
so many laws just by being here.

I do understand.

But isn't that part of the fun,
almost getting caught?

No, the fun is to not come
close to getting caught.

Wanna play the word game?

What is it with you
and that word game?

Something to fucking do.

Okay, you're the one who's been
hounding me to come along.

I was perfectly happy
doing this alone.

I know.

I'm glad to.

I just thought it
would be a little more...

less shit.


It's better than...
[phone ringing]

...subways and park benches.

[phone ringing]

Just about.

Okay.

I'm thinking of a...

seven-letter word.

It starts with a "B."

[glass shattering]

[footsteps approaching]

[door opens]

[footsteps continue]




What?

starts with "B."

Mission accomplished.

There's so many places
to hide shit down there.

If we need a quick escape,
that's our route.

Check it out.

[man on TV, indistinct]
How'd you do that?

Downloaded an app.

They keep their Wi-Fi password
next to the chore chart.

You are such a freak.

[man on TV continues,
indistinct]

Wouldn't it be kinda funny
to mess with them?

Take some random shit,
make them think they're going crazy?

No.

It wouldn't.

Stop touching stuff, okay?

Can you believe
how loaded these people are?

They have so much money,
and this is the shit they decide to buy?

The wife's some sort
of doctor, I think.

It was on her mail.

Dr. "Stepford Wife."
[doorbell rings]

Shit.


Someone call about a broken window?
Just a second!

He doesn't know you don't live here.

about a broken window.

Yeah, that was my dad.

Uh, it's right this way.

[girl, repairman chattering]

[garage door opens]

Alec! Come on!

Now!

I'm just a window repairman.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

Your husband called about a broken window.

Just finished
putting in a new one.

No more going downstairs.

Ha-ha. Level 59.

Suck it, asshole.

This is so messed up.

Another kid got swiped.

Here, in this town.

Justin Whitter.
Ten years old.

Oh, yeah, Justin.

You know him?

No, Mindy, I kinda stopped
hanging out with ten-year-olds

when I was, like, ten.

Okay, yeah.
Fucking hysterical.

Dude, this is sad.

"Last seen wearing
a green soccer jersey.

Went missing
in Troubadour Park."

Sucks for him.

Yeah, it does.

Here's your bottle.

Okay.

Thanks.

Gotta stay hydrated.

Thanks, Dad.

no, not in there.

Hey, come on.

Hey.

Come on.

I'm not gonna hurt you.


Connor?

Connor, come on.

All right, you're hilarious,
but let me out now.

Connor, I'm serious.
Open the door.

Connor, open the door!

Open the door!

I'm serious.

Connor, open this door!

[banging continues]


What're you doing?

What are you doing?

so I came up the...




[urine trickling]

[wind howling]


Alec!
Get back inside right now!

What if someone sees you?

What happened to the bed?

Husband pissed himself.

Or so he thinks.

What?

Alec.

Come on. You promised.

You said that
you would be cool.

I'm not finished playing yet.

Playing with what?

No. No. That's not how this works.
[Todd speaking, indistinct]

Okay? We don't mess
with these people.

We don't terrorize them.
We coexist.

Then what's the point?

What's the point if we don't make
them question their sanity a little?

did I freak you out by what I said last time?

[breathing heavily]
I mean it.

Come on, please.

I don't want to be with you.

Okeydokey.

[Todd groans]

What the...



I'm fine. I'm fine.

I gotta sit down.

Come with me. Come with me.

What the fuck did you just do?
Relax. It's a little bump.

What is wrong with you?
Nothing is wrong with me.

Do you realize that
they're gonna call the cops?

No, they're not.
We have to get out of here.

Yeah, you do.

What?

What is going on?

Why are you doing this,
Alec?

Okay, I brought you here
because I trusted you.

I know.

And I'm sorry.

But I'm having fun.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

What's going on?
Alec, I don't know what's happening.


[footsteps approaching]

[footsteps continue]

[door closes]

That's it.

We're leaving right now.

Okay.

Okay.

Shit.

Our stuff is
in the basement.

Great plan.
Well, it would've been.

We need to figure out a way
to get them out of the house

or just distract them
or something.

He dropped his phone.

What?
No, what're you talking about?

Get in the car.
I'll be right there.



Knew it was in there.

Good man.

Holy shit.

I wasn't...

you can call?</i>



He's been so angry.

to kill someone.

Maybe it was an accident.

I don't know what's happening.

No, no! You don't get
to lose it right now!

Listen to me.

Do you know...
what will happen to our son?

I won't be able to protect him.

[floor creaking]

Alec?

Get out.

Don't look at me like that.

You're insane.

Please.
I'm calling the cops.

No, I am not going to let you
ruin this for me. Get off me!


Mindy?

Mindy?

Come on!

Come on!

Jackie!

I'll call you when I'm on my way.
I'm gonna find him, Jackie.

I'm gonna find the son of a
bitch who did this to Connor.

I don't know.

We're in the woods somewhere.

[hammer cocks]

I know what you are.

And what are you?

Some kind of vigilante?

I know you took those boys.

No, you took those boys.

You and your friend
kidnapped those boys.

Then you came here to terrorize
the lead detective on the case.

You tied up his son.

He was gonna be next.
I stopped you just in time.

[siren wailing in distance]

You shoot me,
you're shooting a cop.

You have any idea
what's coming for you?

Wait.

Please...

You don't understand.

When I was a little boy...
I don't give a fuck.
