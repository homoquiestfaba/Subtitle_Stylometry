(THUNDER RAMBLING)

Thank you both for coming.

Emerald City needs all the heart
and courage it can get right now.

Got your back, straw man.
You can count on us.

Oh? You can count now, can you?

Oh, boy. Sounds like somebody
needs an oil change.

What'd you do?
Forget to prime your pump?

Oh, very brave. I think that
crown has gone to your head.

Can it, rust bucket!
Oh, how dare you!

I'll show you how! Come on,
funnel-head! Let's go!

(SIGHS)
Clank, clank, clank! Anybody in here?

Oh, yeah. That just happened.

Break it up, you two knuckleheads.
We're in a grave situation here!

Ah, sorry.
Yeah.

I-I guess we're all a little on edge, huh?
Copy that.

But with all of Oz at risk,
I need you two to stand guard...

while I try to contact Dorothy.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
"Contact Dorothy"? How?

I'm a genius, remember?

But she's probably forgotten
all about us by now.

Whoa, yeah. It's been a long time.

For us my friends, yes. But time in Oz
passes differently than in her world.

It's been years since she
destroyed the Wicked Witches,

but to her it's going to
seem like only yesterday.

Well, let's hope she got
a good night's sleep.

Now, you two keep an eye
on that broomstick while I...

(GASP)
(THUNDERCLAP)

(LION) Oh, too late!
Secure the chamber!

We've got to
get through to Dorothy.

Dorothy. Scarecrow to Dorothy.

Come in, Dorothy. Come in, Dorothy.

(THUNDERCLAP)
(SCARECROW) Dorothy!

(GRUNTS, GROANS)

(DOG WHINES, PANTS)

Toto.

(TOTO WHIMPERS)
(DOROTHY GASPS)

(WATER DRIPPING)


That twister took out everything in its path.
(GASPS)

Knocked the house
right off its foundation.

(AUNT EM) Do you think we can fix it?
I don't know.

That's an awful lot of damage.

Uncle Henry!

(BREATHING HEAVILY) Auntie Em?

(PANTING)
(TOTO WHIMPERS)

(AUNT EM) Dorothy?
(GASPS)

Oh. (BREATHES HEAVILY)
Dorothy.

It's not fair!

Oh, I know, sweetie.
(SOBS)

It's not fair. But
it's just a house.

If we have to find another
one, we'll find another one.

No. We can't just leave.
Dorothy,

we gotta face facts.

Look at the barn.
Look at the house.

We'll have to have it all appraised,
but we shouldn't get our hopes up.

(SNARLS, GROANS)

(CLEARS THROAT) Move back. Move back.
(BULLHORN FEEDBACK)

We need to create a halo of
safety around this disaster area.

Thank you.
(GROWLS)

Excuse me. This is our home.

Your home. (LAUGHS)

A home is where you live.
This is a disaster area.

(FEEDBACK)
Oh. Can this not be adjusted?

Then do it. Thanks so much.

And who are you?
I'm the Appraiser.

Are you with the government?
I didn't see a badge.

Don't be rude, Dorothy.

Oh, outspoken.

We're... government adjacent.

(â™ªâ™ª WHISTLING)

Hmm. Broken support beams,
cracked concr...

Are you writing this down? Thank you.
(GRUNTS)

Cracked concrete footing.

Ah! (LAUGHS)
(UNCLE HENRY) Hey!

What do you think you're doing?
That thing was about to fall.

I probably just saved your life.
But I don't need any recognition.

Just doing my job.
(GROWLING)

Now, I've made
a thorough assessment,

and I'm afraid you'll
have to vacate immediately.

What?
Read this.

There's no reason to kick
us out. We can fix it.

Dorothy, hold on.
I'll fix it myself if I have to.

So sorry, but according
to the state of Kansas,

the fate of this property
is decided by me,

not some little girl.

(GROWLING)
(CRIES OUT)

Flea-bitten, dirty,
possibly rabid...

You, do something useful. (GRUNTS)

(LACKEY GRUNTING)

(WHIMPERS)
(APPRAISER) You've got until...

sunset to vacate the premises.

Meet me at the shelter in town to sign the
paperwork, or we'll be back to throw you out!

Oh, oh...
Good seeing ya.

(MUTTERING, GRUNTS, SCREAMS)

Well, that's that.

Better start packing.
What? No!

You heard what the man said.

If he says the house is unsafe,
I won't have you in it.

Who is he to decide that?

It's totally... it's-it's fixable.

These are
grown-up decisions, Dorothy.

Sorry, but you're gonna
have to leave this to us.

Well, I'm not leaving.
This is our home.

(SOBBING)
Dorothy!

Let's give her a little time, Em.

She's been through a lot.

(CHICKS CHIRPING)

Anybody home?



Look, Toto, we can fix this.


(BARKS)
Shh. You'll scare them.

(CLICKS TONGUE, CLUCKS LIKE CHICKEN)
Hmm.

â™ª When the world

â™ª If only I knew â™ª

â™ª How to fix it all I would â™ª

(TIRES SCREECHING)

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª Nobody knows where the
world's gonna fly â™ª

â™ª But I still gotta give it a try â™ª

(TOTO BARKS, GROWLS)

â™ª Guess I should get ready now â™ª

â™ª For when it comes again â™ª


â™ª What do I hold?

â™ª And will I feel this all alone? â™ª

â™ª If only I knew â™ª

â™ª How to fix it all I would â™ª

â™ª If only one heart â™ª

â™ª All alone did any good â™ª

â™ª But I'm just so small â™ª

â™ª Now that the world

â™ª Turned upside down â™ªâ™ª


(THUNDER RAMBLING)

(WHINES, BARKS)

Oh. Oh, how pretty.


Huh.

It must be some kind
of optical illusion.


That's no illusion, Toto.

Run!



Help!


Hi, kiddo!
Scarecrow?

What is this? What's happening?

We're flying you back to Oz in a
rainbow mover. I invented it.

Show-off.
Cowardly Lion?

It's just Lion now. (ROARING)

See?
Oh, my.
Dorothy.

Hi, Tin Man.

I am so overjoyed to see you.

You guys, dragging me into a
giant rainbow really scared me.

I can only imagine
how you must feel.

Trapped alone in a giant rainbow.
Surrounded by colors.

It must be just (SOBS) horrible! Oh!

Ever since he got his heart,
he's been all over the place.

I never had emotions before.

I just want to try them all out.

Dorothy, we don't have much time.

There's trouble in Oz, and only
you... threatening the land...

and you are the only one
who can stop...


Hold that door!
(GRUNTS)

(DOROTHY) What's going on?
Hang on, Dorothy.

We'll explain everything when you get here.
Where?

Emerald City!
I-In the Wizard's chamber.

I smell flyin' monkeys!

Oh, no.
Monkeys!

Dorothy. Scarecrow to Dorothy.
Come in, Dorothy.

The door...
Scarecrow to Dorothy.

Is starting to give!

I've lost contact with Dorothy.
I can't get her back!


I can't hold it!
(SNARLING)


Aaah!

Hurry!
(SHOUTS)



(HOOTING, JABBERING)


Oof!
(GRUNTS)

(FLOWER FAIRIES CHATTERING)
(DOROTHY) I can't believe it, Toto.

We're really back in Oz.

Wait. Scarecrow?

Scarecrow!
(BARKING)

(SOFT BARK)
(PANICKED SHOUT)


Come on, Toto. We've got
to get to Emerald City.

It sounds like the guys
are in trouble.

If only Glinda were here.
She'd know what to do.

(WOMAN LAUGHS)
Now, now. Oops.

No, don't push.
I'm coming right along.

(FLYING MONKEYS GRUNTING)

Please, if...

If you would just
give me my wand back.

(JABBERING)
(WOMAN) Oh, now, you don't want to do that.

Don't say I didn't warn you.

Magic in the wrong hands can
be a very dangerous thing.

(DOOR SLAMS)

Oh, Glinda.

Sweet Glinda.

Ah, the Jester.

I am so thrilled to have
you as my guest.

I'm captivated.

Isn't it wonderful...

when two great powers
as you and I...

meet face-to-face,
(LAUGHING)

Peer-to-peer, toe-to-toe?


My, but you're... silly.

"Silly"? By "silly,"
surely you mean diabolical.

(LAUGHS)
No?


It's the costume, isn't it?

I know, I know.
Hard to take me seriously.

It's my curse. Literally.

I can't take this off... ever.

My wicked sister did this to me with
one of her funny little spells.

I knew your sister all too well.

I never knew she had
a sense of humor.

(LAUGHING)
It's not funny to me!


But now I'm ready to embrace a
whole new role as ruler of Oz.

And you're gonna give me your
Good Ozkeeping seal of approval.

But I don't approve.

The Land of Oz is already falling
into ruin because of you.

No good can come
from the reign of a fool.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

Agh, Glinda.

Glinda, Glinda, Glinda.

You are such a disappointment,
just like all the others.

(GLINDA GASPS)
What have you done to them?

Even a fool has a few tricks
up his sleeve.

The magic of that broomstick
belongs to someone else.

Uh-uh-uh.

But with this little baby,

the magic is magnified
and becomes all mine.

(â™ªâ™ª HUMMING)

Dorothy Gale will stop you.

She will find a way back to Oz,
and she will stop you! (ECHOING)

Ooh. "Dorothy Gale will stop you."



Where once your
living soul did dwell,

now is nothing but an empty shell!

Now do you approve?

You rule, O generous Jester.

Attagirl.


(COUGHS, GASPS)

Aw, come on! What is that?

To my tower. Fly!

Now just around this corner,

I'm sure there's a buttress we can slide down.
Wait!

That's the window we escaped from.

We're just going around in circles!

Hmm.
Some genius you turned out to be.





Listen to that racket.

Sounds like they're wreckin' the place.
I think that's me.


How ironic to get a heart,
only to have it attack me.

Oh, the pain! The pain!

Gadzooks! I just realized
something horrible.

Dorothy could be here any minute and
walk right into a flyin' monkey ambush.

Oh, that is horrible. Empathy!

Horror! Fear!

How about I jump in there
and tear 'em all apart?

Just rip 'em limb from limb!

Let's use brains, not brawn.

(LION) Oh.
(TIN MAN WHIMPERS)

Wait a minute.

I have a brilliant plan.

Ah, relief.
Is it a...

tear them all limb from limb plan?

Nope. It's the tear him
limb from limb plan.

Wha...

(THUNDER RAMBLING)


Not a toy! No touchies!
No touchies!

(DISTORTED, INDISTINCT)

on, come on, come on.

Show me the girl.

Show her to me, please.

Aaah! The only person
who could threaten my plan...

is here in Oz,
and I don't know where.

Do you know how annoying that is?

I can't let her beat me.
My plan is almost complete.
(GAGS)

And you better figure
out a way to help me,

or you'll be grounded, and you
can kiss your wings good-bye.

Oh. (JABBERS)
Ah!

Haven't we been though this before?

I don't speak monkey.

Come on, Toto. Let's go
find the yellow brick road.

That's her? That's Dorothy Gale,
the witch slayer from Kansas?

Why she's just a little girl.

And she's headed for Candy County.

Oh! Well, I'll just let her
taste their treats.


You!

Ready your minions. We're
going to double our efforts.

Go to the Emerald City.

Join the others.

And don't come back without that
scarecrow, that lion and that tin can!


I'll take care of the girl.

(CACKLING)
(SHOUTING)

Fly! Fly! Fly, my babies!

Now for a little insurance.

Moon and Earth and stars align.

Show the wayward girl a sign.

Oh, Toto. This doesn't look
like the Oz I remember.

Emerald City must be
in that direction.

I think.
Correct!

(GASPS)
Though I'm not sure I would advise you to go.

Lately, many are going,
but few are returning.

Whoa. You are a really fa...

fabulous... owl. (CHUCKLES)

Oh. You're very kind.
I usually hear "fat."

But, of course, my theory is that I'm
just not quite the right height.

If I were twice as tall,
for instance... Ooh!

Aaah! Ow! Whoo!

Ow! Oh!

Oh! Oh, Oh! Ow!

Aaah!
Uh, are you okay?

Physically? Yes.

But I do have a large piece of
bark lodged in my hindquarters...

Oh! Sorry. I'm giving you
too much information, aren't I?

I do that. My name is Wiser.

Nice to meet you, Wiser.
I'm Dorothy Gale.


And Toto.
(BARKS)

I'm a really big fan of your work.

Timber!

Wow, you really...
Know everything?

And...
Finish other people's sentences?
Oh, no, I'm doing it again!

I'm sorry. I can't help it.

I'll just go. Farewell,
Dorothy and Toto.

No, w-wait.

I need to get to Emerald City, and I
can't seem to find the yellow brick...

House? Wall? Fireplace?
Road.

Oh, of course. Why would you be
looking for a yellow brick wall?

That's silly, at the very least.

There's the high road, and then there's the
low road. I know every square acre of Oz.

But why would you want me to come with
you? I'm a miserable traveling companion.

I talk incessantly.
Yes, I...

I require frequent rest stops at which, I
should warn you, I will also talk incessantly.

It's a terrible habit, I know.
But habits are hard to break.

If we could break them,
they wouldn't be habits.

That's okay. I was hoping maybe
you could... fly me there.

In what?
(CHUCKLES)

Oh. Oh, you mean me?

I suppose I could do that.
Only... I can't fly.

(WHINES)
I mean, I could in the past, but...

There's no need to be embarrassed.

Maybe you could just point the way.

Ah. Actually,
it's in this direction.

I know a shortcut
through Candy County.

But I must warn you, if we're to travel
through Candy County, there's one rule.

What is that?
You must obey the signs.

Which will be difficult
since I'm quite hungry!



Y-You did say obey
the signs, right?

Right. (GASPS)

They must have changed
the rules. Follow me!

Whoo!

(â™ªâ™ª ROCK INTRO)

â™ª Eat anything you want â™ª

â™ª Stick around and gulp it down â™ª

Halt! You are under arrest.

You are all under arrest.

Under arrest?
Yes.

Sorry to say,
you have broken the law.

I'm being arrested
by a giant marshmallow?

Marshal Mallow. Second in command
of the garrison at Candy County.

What did we do?
Violation of section eight, paragraph 12 of...

penal code 16165.
Penal code 16165.

(MARSHAL MALLOW) Eating candy.
But we didn't know.

I'm so very sorry, but
there is thorough signage.

They didn't say that before.

Cuff 'em.


Don't even think about eating
the restraints. (CLEARS THROAT)

And no licking!

What are you gonna do with us?

We're taking you to the
Candy Courthouse,

where you will be tried
by Judge Jawbreaker...

(WISER GASPS) The Hanging Judge?

I was going to say that.
Sorry. I do that.

He really does.

But the sign said,
"Eat all the candy you want."

Your Honor, they are entitled to a

Oh, all right. What say ye, Peeps?


What are they saying?
Peep, peep, peep a-cheep.

Can't you hear that?
(GAVEL BANGS)

Guilty!

Let the punishment fit the crime.

I hereby sentence you to death!


I knew they'd go nuts for that.

Death? For eating candy?


Marshal Mallow?
Milord?

I hereby order you to execute
uh, uh, the execution.

Me?
Yes, you.

But as an officer in the
Candy County Army,

I can only follow orders
from General Candy Apple.

Bosh.
Excuse me, Your Judgeship.

Names, please?
What for?

Your death certificates.

Wiser.
Wiser with a "Z"?

Wiser with an "S."
And your name is?


(MURMURING)
(SQUEAKING)


Dorothy Gale?

The... The witch slaying
girl from Kansas?

Well, sort of.

Mallow, approach the bench!

What the devil's food
is going on here?

Are you trying to make me look like a fool?
Of course not, milord.

This girl is one of the greatest
heroes Oz has ever known!

She's well above reproach!

You should know that!
Everyone knows that!

What do they teach you
in the academy anyway?

As Lord High Judge of this court,

I hereby commute
the death sentence.

(CHEERING)
Free the prisoners!


Yes, milord,

but the charges must stand until
General Candy Apple can be found.

Well, where in confection is he?

He was called to Emerald City days ago
but should have been back by now.

Then I suggest, Marshal Mallow,
you go find him.

Whew! Well, I don't know
about anyone else,

but I could really go
for-for a little snack.

Too soon?
Yes, I think so.

Inappropriate.
(WHINES, BARKS)


(SHRIEKS, MUTTERS)
(GROWLING)

I'm terribly, terribly sorry
for all this, milady.

It's just that I am duty bound
to follow the general's orders.

It's okay.
Yes, we understand.

I can't fathom what's taking
him so long to return.

Well, we're going to Emerald City.
You're welcome to join us.

I-Is that an order?

No, no, it's an invitation.

Well, in that case, I...
I believe I can.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

Wow, what a great wall.

It's made of china.

What a great wall of china.

(LID OPENING)
Halt!

State your name and business.

My name is Dorothy,

and this is Marshal Mallow and Wiser.
(NERVOUS LAUGH)

We're trying to get through
to the yellow brick road.

In order to cross the wall,
you'll need permission...

from Her Royal Highness, the
princess of Dainty China Country.

Ooh, ooh. Oh, so pretty.


That was a warning shot.

Oh, we should, um, respect
their national borders.

(WHIMPERS, BARKS)

Good comrade, sir,

may we request an audience
with the Dainty China princess?

No. She's otherwise engaged.

I mean, she's busy getting engaged.

She's welcoming suitors today.

Suitors. Hmm. H-He-He's a suitor.

(GASP)
Which one?

Marshal Mallow is the suitor,

and he would like to ask for the
hand of the Dainty China princess.

Oh.
(GUARD) The princess? Oh.
Well, why didn't you say so?

Escort the giants in!

(â™ªâ™ª FANFARE)




But I don't want to be a suitor.
I don't want to get married.

What if she's cute?

Appearance isn't everything. The
name's Mallow, not "Shallow."

â™ª Suitor gets the ax â™ªâ™ª

Oh!
So I suppose that's a "no" then, is it?

Fine.

Menders, over here.
Get some glue, and lots of it.

Well, you can't win them all, eh?
Ow!

Oh!
No!
Oh, dear!

Oh, careful!
Excuse me. I'm still talking to the lady!

(SUITOR) Put me down!
Next.

(GIGGLING)

I mean, Your Shininess. Uh...

Go on. Keep going.

Um, uh...

Uh, I-I mean, Your, um...

It seems the man made of
marshmallow is all mushy-mouthed.



â™ª When a princess seeks a prince â™ª

â™ª There's only one heart

â™ª A heart that flutters like

â™ª One can dream the dream alone â™ª

â™ª Or pursue a man unknown â™ª

â™ª Companionship

â™ª Earthquake! â™ª

Solid ground, shift and shake.

Where once was calm soon will quake!


(GUESTS SCREAMING)

No!


Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

(CHINA PRINCESS)
Tell me the truth. How bad is it?

You're still without flaw.

Oh! Thank goodness.

(PANTING) Milady.
How is the city?

How many broken?
No one broken, but many
cracked and chipped.

And the city is severely damaged.

That was a very heroic
thing you did back there.

Just doing my duty.

We have a mission
of the utmost importance.

Menders, take that man
to the hospital. Quickly!

Excuse me? Your Highness.

May we please pass through your
country on the yellow brick road?

No. You'll have to go around.

But that could take weeks,
and my friends are in danger.

Who do you think you are,

interrupting royal business
with your petty travel plans?

Can't you see we're in
a state of emergency?

Yes, I do see. My home
is in trouble too.

Perhaps you can make an exception
for Miss Dorothy Gale?

Oh!
Oh.

So this is the famous girl who
vanquishes wicked witches.

I thought you'd be taller.
Milady,

she is a very resourceful
young woman.

Ah. Perhaps you'd rather
be a suitor to her.

That's not what I meant.
Silence!

Oh.

These are troubled times in Oz.

Behind our great wall, we are safe.

Now and again the Jester sends an
earthquake or two just to rattle us.

But never one so big.


He must really be angry
about something...

or someone.


This is your fault.

What?
Now just a min...

Don't deny it.

You wanted a little shortcut,

so you forced your way in and brought
the Jester's anger with you!

I don't know any Jester.

I'm just trying to get to Emerald
City to see the Scarecrow.

Maybe I can help
your people somehow.

You're just a little girl from Kansas.
What could you possibly do?

But I...
She doesn't even have a title.

(ALL LAUGHING)


(CHINA SHATTERING)

(SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)

(BROKEN CHINA CLINKING)

(CLEARS THROAT)
I'm going with you.

What?

I'm going with you.
No, milady.

You mustn't go. You could be fractured
before you reach the river.

If I don't go,
we could all be broken.

Then I will send
the royal guard with you.

No, that won't be necessary.

Marshal Mallow will keep me safe.

You have my word, milady.

My dear people,

Miss Dorothy Gale, the witch slaying
giant from Kansas, and her friends,

will accompany me as my servants...

on a mission
to Emerald City to meet...

with the Scarecrow.

With his eminent wisdom,

we will surely find a way to end
the Jester's reign of tyranny.

(CLEARS THROAT, WHISPERS)
Bow to me.

Huh?
(WHISPERS) Bow to me.

Lower.

Not to worry, my dear people.

â™ª I'll be back soon! â™ª

What in the Land of Oz
is taking so long?

(MONKEY SCREECHING)
(GASPS)

Ha-ha! They're here!

Oh, I do so love
having important guests.

(â™ªâ™ª HUMMING)


Distinguished company, welcome.

You always tie your company up?

As a matter of fact... yes.


(GASPS)
(GASPS)

(FRIGHTENED SHOUTING)

Are those real... people?

They were real people.

But now they're better than real.

As puppets, they still act
like people...

when I want them to.

Dance!

(â™ªâ™ª WALTZ)

You can't make someone do
that against their will.

Dancing is very personal.

Yeah, dancing is a very
per... very personal thing.

I can make them do whatever I want.

I pull the strings! Literally!

â™ª I would rejoice â™ª

â™ª At the top of my voice â™ª

â™ª I'd be a true warlock â™ª

â™ª But I had no choice â™ª

â™ª My sister was frightful â™ª

â™ª And spitefully made me a clown â™ª

â™ª I shall possess â™ª

â™ª My one happiness â™ª

â™ª The power I covet â™ª

â™ª And who wouldn't love it â™ª

â™ª Would you? â™ª


â™ª Now would you dare try me? â™ª

â™ª And would you deny
me what's mine? â™ª

â™ª Well, now that's a punch line! â™ª

â™ª I guess you'd have guessed â™ª

â™ª A jester must jest â™ª

â™ª When I laugh alone â™ª

â™ª It is I who laughs best â™ªâ™ª

Hotfoot!


(MUFFLED GROANING)

(GROANS)
(WHIMPERS)


You're going to scuff my finish.

I'm just walking.
You're bouncing.

This is very uncomfortable.

I hope you're not gonna be
like this the whole trip.

I am a princess! Remember?



(GASPS, GROANS)

More destruction.

Where are we?

This is the Munchkin River, Your
Highness. It leads to Emerald City.

It looks like the yellow
brick road ends here.

Oh, great. What do we do now?

Make camp and wait for orders?

We'll build a boat.

And what, pray tell, will we,

or rather, you,
build this boat out of?

The owl?
Uh, no.

We'll figure it out.
How hard can it be?

There are trees everywhere.

Ow! Hey!

(GROANING)
Sorry. So sorry. I...

How would you like it if I just walked
up to you and broke your arm off?

Ow! I didn't mean any harm.

We're trying to get
to Emerald City.

And to do it we need wood...
to build a boat.

A boat!
A boat?

You want to build a boat?
You've got a lot of nerve.

Not my idea.

Hey, I know her.

Isn't she the one that stole
the apples off Uncle Manny?

What?
That's her.

trees really hold a grudge.

(ALL SHOUTING)

At least we're out of range.

Ow.
And stay out!

(PANTING)
(OLD MALE) Take me.

Take me.

I would like to volunteer these old
timbers as material for your boat.

Oh, no. We could never
hurl a talking tree.

At least not on purpose.

I'm 978 years old.

And honestly, I don't have
many rings left.

I can stay here and rot,
taking up someone else's sun,

or I can come with you and be part of
something important, something great.

I don't know what to say.
Except thank you.

Oh, this is a very brave
sacrifice you're making.

No sap off my brow.

(GROANS, LAUGHS)

I know I can â™ª

â™ª Let's get things goin'

â™ª Can't get across
It's sink or swim â™ª

â™ª I'll build a boat

â™ª We're better together

â™ª With a little help, we can
get this done, work with me â™ª

â™ª Work with me

â™ª It's true, it's true,
it's true, it's true, it's true â™ª

â™ª Work with me I'll work with you â™ª

We need to truss that up there.

â™ª We're gonna get there
Need a little time â™ª

â™ª You give me yours â™ª
â™ª I'll give you mine â™ª

â™ª Heads together till the end â™ª

Well, thank you, Princess.

(â™ªâ™ª TUGG HUMMING)

Land ho!

Oh, my.

What happened to this place?

It used to be... so beautiful.


Lion? Scarecrow?

Tin Man?

(MARSHAL MALLOW, ECHOING)
It's totally abandoned.


(BARKS)
(ECHOES)


(WISER WHIMPERS)
General?

Scarecrow?
General Candy Apple, sir?

They've all gone.

P-Perhaps they're having lunch.

The courteous thing to do
would be to come back later.

M-Much later. Hoo.

broomstick should be.

(GLASS CLINKING)
No wonder things are going wrong.

Oh, look. It's a prismatic tubular
inter-dimensional transporter device.

What?
Huh?

In simpler terms,
it's a rainbow mover.

This is the machine
that brought me here.

Technically the rainbow brought you here.
The machine created the rainbow.

It's sort of
a chicken-and-the-egg thing.

(MARSHAL MALLOW) Ahem.
(WISER) Ooh, sorry.

(SIGHS)
(STATIC CRACKLING, BEEPS)

that might be for you.

What are the odds of that?
65 to 2? I mean...

(STEAM HISSING)

Dorothy, we don't have much time.

There's trouble in Oz,
and only you can help us.

An evil Jester is
threatening the land.

His power comes from a magic scepter he
has at his castle. The scepter is...



Well, well, well. If it isn't
the famous Dorothy Gale.

You stay away from her!

I'm not talking to you, puff ball.

Hoo-hoo.

I, the princess of Dainty...
Silence!

All right, Jester, what have
you done with my friends?

Your friends?

What a coincidence. Why,
I've got them right here.

See?

They have all the comforts of home.
Yikes!

Central heating.
(GASPS)

Running water.
No!

And the coziest accommodations imaginable.
Save yourself Dorothy!

You let them go!

I give the orders around here now.

So if you know what's good for you,

you'll hop in your little rainbow mover
and go back to Kansas where you belong!

No.
Either do as I say or die!


Mallow, grab her!

Right, milady.
(SHRIEKS)

Owl my!

(MONKEY JABBERING)

Oh, why don't you
sing me a song, eh?

Tugg! Tugg, let's move it!


(WISER) Flying monkeys!
Flying monkeys?

Dorothy, take cover.
I'll fight them off.


Here they come.


Goodness me!
Oh!

Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

Stop! Stop!

Can't this old barge
move any faster?

Hang on!

Just try and keep up.

Take that!

Tugg, stay to the right!
Head for that cave!

Aye, aye, Your Highness.

(MARSHAL MALLOW) They're on us!


no, no! You cowards!

You're letting her get away!

Why do I have to do everything myself?
(THUNDERCLAP)

(MARSHAL MALLOW) They're not
coming in. They've left us.

of the dark! Ha! Nyctophobia!

Ha! They act so tough.

But I bet they sleep
with a night-light on.

Silly, scaredy...

(WISER WHIMPERS)
(DOROTHY) I can't see a thing.

Me neither! I'm terrified!

(CHINA PRINCESS)
You're nocturnal. Get a grip.

(WISER WHIMPERS)

Hey, I think I see a way out.

(ALL GASP)

(TUGG CHUCKLES)
(DOROTHY) What?

Fireflies!

I haven't seen you guys in ages.
Where have you been?

Oh, they're... They're beautiful!


thing I've ever seen.

Milady.

Oh, how romantic.

Where do you think we're headed?

Whoa.

By that compass,
we are heading northwest,

which means this little tributary
will take us to the Jester's castle.

(CHINA PRINCESS GIGGLES) Yes!
(DOROTHY) Perfect! That's great.

Under cover of darkness, we can
belly crawl past the guards...

Then we can sneak in
and free my friends.

Ah! We have a plan.

(ALL CHUCKLE)


Which way should we go?

(CHINA PRINCESS) Let's follow
the fireflies. They seem to know.

Looks like right... is right.

Thank you, fireflies.

Aha! It's the least I could do.

Have a nice ride!

See you next fall!

Oh, no. It's a trap.

Tugg, turn back!

I can't! The current is too strong!



Oh!

Whoa!



Everyone, hold on tight!



(MOCK SOBS)
Good-bye, Dorothy Gale.

Good-bye.
(MOCK SOBS)

Say good-bye to Dorothy
Gale, everyone.

Let that be a lesson to all of you.

Don't... mess... with the Jester!

What have you done?
(JESTER CACKLES)

Mmm.

Oh.

Is everyone okay?
(GRUNTS)

(GRUNTS)
You all right?

Yes, ma'am.
Wiser?

Hmm? Affirmative.

Toto?
(WHIMPERS)

Tugg?
Oh. A few splinters.


China Princess?

(SNIFFS)
(MARSHAL MALLOW) Princess!


(WHIMPERS, BARKS)

(GASPS)
Oh, no.


(RAGGED BREATH)
Oh. I should have protected her.

I neglected my duty.

Mmm.





Where are you going?

I'm going to confront
the Jester myself.

I can't let anyone else get hurt.

We won't let you go alone.
Don't follow me.

But we've come this far.
That's an order.



How? How is it
possible she survived?

Foiling those stupid
monkeys is one thing,

but surviving my waterfall trick?

I mean, that's a good trick!

Positively... humiliating.

(JABBERS)
(SHOUTS)

Idiot! This is all your fault!

Dorothy would be dead by now if it
weren't for this abysmal failure.

Your abysmal failure, pal.

How dare you ruin my perfect
record of jesterly awfulness?

Well, don't say I didn't warn you,
you fuzzy evolutionary reject.

You're grounded!

Ready the castle! Roll out the
welcome mat for Miss Dorothy Gale.

She's going to get the kind of
reception that's to die for.

Ow!

Is there anything I can do?

Yes. Get some help.

How?

Oh, I don't know,
smart guy! Figure it out.



Ah!

Ooh! Ooh!
You're flying.

You're flying!

I am? I am! (LAUGHS)

Ouch! (LAUGHS)

I mean, I mean,
it's been a long time.


I will find help, but I don't
know how long I can stay up.

Believe in yourself, soldier.

Dorothy's life depends on it!

Sir. Yes, sir.


Ow.

Ooh!

â™ª Never told you
But I meant to â™ª

â™ª Before I could begin â™ª

â™ª Even then â™ª

â™ª I loved you even then â™ª

â™ª See my heart is

â™ª That it's never been â™ª

â™ª But even then â™ª

â™ª I loved you even then â™ª

â™ª If my voice should
start to tremble â™ª

â™ª If I am shaking â™ª

â™ª I love you now â™ª

â™ª Like I loved you even then â™ª

â™ª Even if it's uphill now â™ª
â™ª See my heart is scared of places â™ª

â™ª Even when I can't say how â™ª
â™ª That it's never been â™ª

â™ª Even when my heart won't stop pounding â™ª
â™ª My heart won't stop pounding â™ª

(WITH DOROTHY) â™ª Even then â™ª

â™ª Even then â™ª


â™ª I loved you even then â™ª

â™ª Even if it's uphill now â™ª

â™ª Even when
there are no words how â™ª

â™ª When my heart pounds this loud
Even then â™ª

â™ª If I left you I never meant to â™ª

â™ª And I won't pretend â™ª

â™ª Even then â™ª

â™ª I loved you even then â™ª

â™ª If I just knew how to show you â™ª

â™ª Let me try again â™ª

â™ª I love you even now â™ª

â™ª Like I loved you even then â™ª

Welcome to the Jester's

Glinda, what's wrong?

Nothing is wrong.

Everything is simply delightful.

Oh, no!

What has that horrible
Jester done to you?

The Jester isn't horrible.

He's the most generous

All hail the Jester!

What's wrong with all of you?
Why won't you help me?

Because I...

don't want them to!

Thanks, everybody!

Job well done.
Back to your cubbies.

Thank you.

All hail! All hail!

Aren't they just marvelous?

And so obedient.

What have you done to them?

Don't worry. I won't let
them kick the bucket.

Besides, buckets are your
weapon of choice, aren't they?

Like the one full of water
you threw on my sister.

Your sister?

The Wicked Witch?
But I didn't mean to kill her.

Oh, don't apologize.

After all, she was wicked.

(LAUGHS)
(GROWLS)

And if it wasn't for your meddling,

this little baby might never
have found its rightful master.

The witch's broomstick!

I gave that to the Wizard
for the protection of Oz.

You stole it! It belongs to me!

And no little girl from Kansas
is going to take it away!

Where once your living
soul did dwell...


(YELPS)
(CHITTERS)

Ah!

(MUFFLED STRUGGLING) Get me
outta here! I can't see a thing!

Good work, Toto! Great job.
(JESTER CONTINUES)

(GROANING)
Dorothy.

Is that you?

Oh, I was so worried about you.

I'm so glad you guys are all right.

Aw, I think things are better by
the minute now that you're here.

We were worried about you too.

You are very brave
to come and rescue us.

(JESTER CONTINUES) That's
not good! Get me outta here!

Your heart is stronger than
the Jester's magic any day.

(SIGHS)
(JESTER) Ah!

It's beyond belief.

Come back here,
you fuzzy freak of nature!


Come on!
(SCARECROW) Right behind you, kiddo.



Oh, I see.

Someone is feeling pouty.


I think I've let you hold
that scepter long enough.

Now give it back!



Flea-bitten, dirty,
possibly rabid...

(GRUNTS)
Not you.

This you. Just throw it to me!

No! Throw it to me!

Hey, back off,
or I drop the little dog.

Want some of this?


You fools! Come back!

Ah, who needs 'em?

Winds of fortune, winds of fate,

Dorothy!

Oh, no.


In a twister, you

And in a twister, you shall die!

Everyone, run for cover. Now!


Take shelter in the alcoves!

(MARSHAL MALLOW) Dorothy, wait.


Attack!





Oh!
Stop!

Well, aren't you a

The scepter's power
is mine to wield.

Dorothy Gale, your fate is sealed!

(SCEPTER WHIRS)
No!



(BOTH GRUNTING)




Grab on!


Pull!


Oh, Dorothy, I'm
forever in your debt.

The least I could do is,

oh, I don't know, perhaps
help you rule Oz?

Oz has its leaders, and they
don't need this to rule.


No!

My baby! (SCREAMS)

Fly, fly. Don't ever leave me!


(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, Glinda. It's you.

It's really you.
Yes.

The Jester's spell is broken,

and we couldn't have
done it without you.

Oh, it wasn't just me.

I couldn't have done it without all of you.
(CHUCKLES)

But Kansas must be
missing you by now.

I'd love to stay, but I do
think I'm ready to go home.

Whatever will we do without you?

There will always be a rainbow

Good-bye, Dorothy.

Yeah, there she is.

Oh! Where on earth have you been?

I see you're almost packed.

Dorothy, we've been

there's something we can do.

What? There's what?
Follow me!

(EM) Dorothy, wait!
Come on!

(HORNS HONKING)

Hey! Where are you going?

Oh, goody gumdrops, look who it is.

Everyone, please.
Don't listen to him.

These are our homes!

And nobody has the right

Au contraire, my puppet.

This document gives me full

Next!
Has anybody even looked at this?

Gimme...
No.

Give... me... that.
Yep, that's her.

Dorothy!

(BARKS)
Watch it.


(APPRAISER GRUNTING) Someone get
me out of here. Would you stop it?

Look, look. Who is this guy?

(SHERIFF) Hmm.
Which one is he really?

Well, let's just see.
(APPRAISER YELPING)

Get me out of here.
Huh?

Get me out of here!
I'll get you outta here and right to jail.


Let's go, joker.
Please, you're making a horrible mistake.

(EM) Good riddance!
(SHERIFF) You can tell that to the judge.

Hey, what about him?
(GRUNTING)

him. Stop him! He's getting away!

This is all his fault.
He made me do this!

I didn't want to!

â™ª Blue skies ever after â™ª

â™ª One day, it's gonna be fine â™ª

â™ª In my world, dreams
have come and gone â™ª

â™ª In my life â™ª

â™ª I know I must be strong â™ª

â™ª I knew we'd get through this â™ª
(CHAINSAW BUZZES)

â™ª Look how much we've grown â™ª

â™ª I knew we could do this â™ª

â™ª Who says you can't go home? â™ª

â™ª One day, there'll be laughter â™ª

â™ª Blue skies ever after â™ª

â™ª One day, it's gonna be fine â™ª

â™ª I know, come tomorrow â™ª

â™ª Someway, beg or borrow â™ª

â™ª I believe dreams
really can come true â™ª

â™ª Yes, they do â™ª

â™ª Somehow, everything has changed â™ª

â™ª Together, we can
build it up again â™ª

â™ª We'll pick up the pieces
It isn't done alone â™ª

â™ª We've been waiting to do this â™ª

â™ª To find our way back home â™ª

â™ª Oh, when it all
comes falling down â™ª

â™ª Oh, you've got to
turn it all around â™ª

â™ª Yes, I will, yes I will â™ª
(WHINNIES)

â™ª One day, there'll be laughter â™ª

â™ª Blue skies ever after â™ª

â™ª One day, it's gonna be fine â™ª

â™ª I know, come tomorrow â™ª

â™ª Someway, beg or borrow â™ª

â™ª I believe dreams
really can come true â™ª

â™ª Yes, they do â™ª

â™ª One day, one day â™ª

â™ª One day â™ª

turns upside down â™ª

â™ª There's just one thing to do â™ª

â™ª Shake it off and get back up â™ª

â™ª And night in front of you â™ª

â™ª There is work to
do and miles to go â™ª

â™ª No need to stick it out alone â™ª

â™ª You're not alone â™ª

â™ª There's something I know â™ª

â™ª How to change the bad to good â™ª

â™ª Our hearts together â™ª

â™ª Go further than just
one heart could â™ª

â™ª If you feel so small â™ª

â™ª You're not alone at all â™ª

â™ª When the world has
turned upside down â™ª

â™ªWe can see just what we can do â™ª

â™ª Oh, no, we don't know
where the world is gonna fly â™ª

â™ª But we still gotta
give it a try â™ª

â™ª When the world
turns upside down â™ª

â™ª It takes your breath away â™ª

â™ª Think of all the
wondrous things â™ª

â™ª That happen every day â™ª

â™ª No matter how you add it up â™ª

â™ª What turns the world
is always love â™ª

â™ª It's always love â™ª

â™ª There's something I know â™ª

â™ª How to change the bad to good â™ª

â™ª All hearts together â™ª

â™ª Go further than just
one heart could â™ª

â™ª If you feel so small â™ª

â™ª You're not alone at all â™ª

â™ª When the world has
turned upside down â™ª

â™ª Has turned upside down â™ª

â™ª Has turned upside down â™ªâ™ª
