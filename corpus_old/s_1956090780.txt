The Lord is my shepherd;

I shall not want.

He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures;

He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

He restoreth my soul;

He leadeth me on the paths
of righteousness

for His namesake.

Though I walk through
the valley

of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil;

for thou art with me;

Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

Thou preparest
a table before me

in the presence of my enemies.

We are live
at the Texas State Cemetery

for the memorial service
of Blake Redding,

son of Texas Governor
Dean Redding,

who lost his life
when he failed

his thinning exam last week

at Vista Point High School.

Reports have since indicated

that Blake Redding
was not among

the initial students
to fail the exam,

which has shrouded
the Governor's campaign

for president in
a flurry of controversy.

Thank you.

Governor, your thoughts
on the Vista Point scandal?

Not today.

Attending the service

is former
Vista Point High School student

Laina Michaels,

who has become a public figure

since she was wrongfully accused
of failing her exam

and framed for committing
acts of domestic terrorism.

Laina, do you have any plans

for taking legal action
against the Board of Education

for mishandling
your test scores?

I don't know.

Do you hold Governor Redding
personally responsible

for implicating you
as a domestic terrorist?

No comment.
all: Miss Michaels!

I hate to be all business,

but the DPC has appointed
a special investigator

for the Vista Point incident.

It's Agent Joanne Morris.

<i> They didn't waste any time.</i>

Fortunately for you,
Mason King

has signed an affidavit
absolving you

of any connection to the events.

<i> Per your request,
 he's been reassigned.</i>

<i> - Good.
 Where is he?</i>

I'll handle this myself.

You just focus
on what's important:

getting elected.

<i> - How close would you say
 you were to Blake Redding?</i>

I barely knew him.

Talked to him a few times
over the years

but that was it.

Was he your boyfriend?

You guys have
a personal relationship?

He was with Ellie
until last year.

Then he kept to himself.

I barely knew him.

Barely knew him.

You don't have to tell me about
some boy you had feelings for,

but we need to be honest
with each other.

Let's go over the timeline.

An hour before the kiss,

I have you on
the internal server computer.

I need to know what you saw.

I was working fast.

Everything I saw
was posted on the news.

I knew they switched my test,
I was just trying to prove it.

Anything regarding the school
or sensitive material?

I really wish
I could help you.

Here's my card.

If you remember anything

or need someone you can trust,

I just want you to know
you're not alone.

What's so funny?
Joey's on TV.

No, guys, cut it out.

That's my cue.

Take care of yourself, Laina.

Guys.

I need you two to focus.
both: Okay.

No interviews.

Miss Michaels,

it's Jack Prescott
with Governor Redding's team.

What does he want?

He needs to see you.

It's about Blake.

Hi.

Hi.

You said something
about Blake?

I can't believe
I'm walking these floors.

Two years ago, I put a picture

of this place
on my vision board.

Now I'm here.

Loving the new look, Wendy.

Auburn?
Rosewood.

This is the bullpen.

A lot of the junior staffers
get thrown here,

but since I took a chance
getting the station

to hire the first
non-intern under 20,

you get your own office.

Now we're talking.

This room used to be a closet.
Now it's yours.

In real estate terms,
they call this

"cozy with potential."

There are still a lot
of questions that need answers

about what happened
at Vista Point High.

I get it.

You want me to dig deep
and uncover what's really

going on at
Vista Point High, right?

Question authorities,
make it clear that BNC News

is gonna ask hard questions
and accept the blowback

regardless of the consequences.

No.

Kellan, this is your first day.

You're starting at the bottom.
That's how this works.

First up, a science piece.

Parents want to know what
chemicals are being administered

to the students who
go to the thinning.

I'm gonna send you out
to do a prelim.

Uh, two things.

Number one, what's a prelim?

Number two,
when are you grabbing dinner?

Talk to people.
Find an angle.

Set up interviews, chase leads.

You do that, we'll get dinner.

It's a date.
I'm married.

Get to work.

Miss Michaels.

It's so nice
to finally meet you.

You went on TV
and said I was a terrorist.

Right to the chase.
I love it.

I was given misleading
information from my people.

I want to apologize.

You didn't call me in here
to apologize.

I wanted to offer you
an advisory role

on our new
Thinning Oversight Committee.

No thanks.

The thinning isn't perfect,
but it's the law.

And with this recent incident,

there's been strong
headwinds against it.

People want to see
the other side of the story.

You want me
to stump for you.

It'd be a very
generous paycheck

for you and your siblings,

take care of you
for quite some time.

Thanks for the water.

Hi, guys.
Let's go.

Laina.
Georgina Preston.

Oh, this must be your family.

I hear you will be taking
your first test this year.

How exciting.

Corrine has 11 more years
of testing.

I'd imagine it would be nice
to have a little...

support.

Jack will take you home.

Excuse me?
You just passed our house.

Laina?

Help!

Who are you?
Where are Corrine and Joey?

They're safe.

Everything is okay.

See?

Miss Cole?

all: Morning, Miss Cole.

Maggie.

I'm sorry for the scare.

This is kind of
a sensitive operation.

Tell the Governor
I'm not working for him.

We're not with the Governor.

We're with The Fight.

<i> - We're hiding in plain sight</i>

<i> at all levels of government</i>

to garner influence
to end the thinning,

and transport at-risk students
to safe houses.

You can get people out?

That's what we do.

Mister Leonard over there
has personally escorted

over 100 students
across the border

to a secure island
off the Gulf.

Corrine and Joey--
you have to get them out.

That's why we need you
to help the Governor.

No.

I'm not going to be
a mouthpiece for the thinning.

If you won't help me
get them out,

then I'm going to do it myself.

You know what happens
when they catch a runaway?

The kids get split up.

<i> They bounce around
 in state homes.</i>

<i> They get
 a third-rate education</i>

and a guaranteed trip
to the thinning.

You don't want that.

With the right candidate
in place,

we can do a full repeal
of the thinning,

and find a more humane way
to combat our population crisis.

But if Redding
becomes president,

the thinning will stay strong

and continue to send
innocent kids to die.

And that could just be
the tip of the iceberg.

What does Georgina have
to do with all this?

We don't know.

That's what
we need you to find out.

If she has her way,

when Governor Redding
becomes President Redding,

we lose our window
to stop the thinning.

I mean, who knows
what the future could hold.

So, uh, you worked the day
Blake's body was being prepared?

Yes, I was on-site.

And did you handle the body?

Not personally, no.

Kellan,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

I know.
Um, weird question.

Do you own a shovel?

And out of all nine employees
who worked that 72-hour period,

not one person ever
saw or handled the body.

That's crazy.

No.
We're crazy.

Okay--oh.

Hey.

Are you good?
Yeah.

Be careful.

Wait.

No.

Yeah.

Are we doing this?

Here.

I can't believe
you're doing all this for a guy

that doesn't even
know your name.

Light.
Yeah, sorry.

Congratulations.

Your class has been spared.

<i> Every single one of you
 was chosen by our system</i>

<i> and deemed worthy to receive</i>

<i> a second chance at life.</i>

<i> I realize you may have
 a couple of questions.</i>

<i> Okay, let's begin.</i>

<i> Our first, most commonly-asked
 question is:</i>

<i> "Am I dead?"</i>

<i> No.
 You're not dead.</i>

<i> Question two:</i>

<i> "Where am I?"</i>

Well, you're in The Incubator,

a special facility
designed and sponsored

by the great minds
at Assuru Global.

<i> We are here
 to help you grow</i>

from a parasitic leech
on our society

to a productive member
of the working class.

<i> I know what you're thinking:
 "Why me?"</i>

<i> Using our patented algorithm,</i>

<i> we analyzed the test scores
 of this year's</i>

<i> failing students
 and determined that</i>

<i> you still have
 value and special skills</i>

<i> that can be utilized
 to better America.</i>

Sorry, that was a lot of words.

To put it simply:
you were chosen, silly.

<i> Last question:</i>

"Do I get to go back?"

The most productive members
of the Incubator program

will be considered
for reintroduction to society.

<i> Again, congratulations
 on being selected</i>

<i> and getting to begin
 your new life.</i>

<i> Be worthy.</i>

We made it!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

<i> Remember: be worthy.</i>

Ellie!

Ellie!

Ellie!

You're alive.

I am alive.

I thought I was
seeing things.

Where are we?

They didn't tell you?

We were chosen.

I never thought
I'd see you again.

No.

Not here.

We have a curfew in an hour.

Ellie, I love you.

I can't believe
it's been a year.

I don't know how
I'd live without you.

I missed you so much.

It's crazy that
we're still alive.

I thought it was all over.

When they put
that needle into my neck,

I really thought that
that was it.

I thought I was gonna die.

Hey.

This place gives us a purpose.

Like, a second chance
to help and do right.

Why would they kill some kids
and spare others?

That doesn't make any sense.

You don't really
believe that, do you?

Of course.

We were chosen.

I mean, they believe that

we have something to contribute.

We can be worthy.

If they lied
to everyone before,

why wouldn't they lie
to us now?

<i> - Refusal to work.</i>

<i> Refusal to work.</i>

Oh, you've had enough?

Do it!
Do it!

Jump, jump!
Come on!

Jump, jump!
You're weak!

Come on!
You're weak!

You hear me?

Come on!
Do it!

You're weak!
Jump!

Come on!
Jump! Jump!

He's weak.
You're not worthy!

Now jump!

<i> - Get the net!</i>

Snip, snip.

"Snip, snip"?

I heard anyone
who refuses to work

is sent to the infirmary,
and within a few hours

they come back with alterations.

What'd he get?

That's him.

You must be new.

I'm Cage.

Blake Redding.

Governor's kid, right?

That's cute.

Probably used to
getting whatever you want,

like Ellie.

You know,

since you're new here,

I'm gonna take it easy on you.

Ellie belongs

to me now.

You can do whatever you want.

But if you look at her again,

I'm gonna kill you.

Okay.

It's not gonna stop.

What's up, boss?
Hey.

Hey, what's the deal with
those kids with the patches?

Oh.

That's The Worthy.

They're hand-selected
by The Incubator

to help supervise
the other workers.

They're like cops?
Yeah, more like mall cops.

They're first in line
for reintroduction.

Oh, that's pretty awesome.
All this shit's co-ed.

We're slaves, idiot.

I'm not a slave.

I'm nobody's slave.

I'm Wade Freeman, bitch.

You know what?

Yeah,
that's a really good point.

You're Wade Freeman.
Bitch.

He's Wade Freeman Bitch.

Go.

Ellie, what is this?

Just leave.

I'm not going anywhere
without you.

They will kill you.

Please go.

Uh, this is Cage's girl,
Redding.

So you can move along now.

We're just talking.

Move along now.

No.

I'm not leaving
without her.

Let's go.

Security!

It's over.

Come on.

They're
approaching Sector 24!

Come on.

Run. Go!

Run, Ellie!
Run!

Blake!
Keep them separate.

Ellie!

Blake!
Ellie!

You.

Going somewhere, Blake?

No.
Not anymore.

<i> - Things are heating up
 in an election that</i>

<i> could be a turning point
 in American history.</i>

<i> Texas Governor Dean Redding,</i>

<i> backed by tech leader
 Assuru Global,</i>

<i> is running on
 the strength and success</i>

<i> of the national
 thinning program.</i>

<i> Vermont Senator Elaine Davis</i>

<i> has taken a strong
 anti-thinning platform</i>

<i> that has brought her all the wa
 to her party's nomination.</i>

She calls for a complete repeal
of the thinning,

which has proven very popular
among young voters.

Enough is enough.

It's time to protect our kids

from this inhumane
and unconstitutional law.

It's time to end the thinning.

Even with a chance to reform,
Laina Michaels

continues her unwavering support

for Governor Redding
and the thinning.

Being against the thinning
is a dishonor

to all the brave students
who sacrificed their lives

so we could be here today.

The Governor
went on television

and called you
a domestic terrorist,

a murderer,
without any evidence.

How can you support someone

who would
so viciously slander you?

And what does that say about
the Governor's leadership?

<i> - I credit a man
 who will correct his mistakes</i>

<i> and own up to them.</i>

<i> Governor Redding
 is that kind of man.</i>

<i> - But the investigation--</i>

<i> - It's been nearly a year,</i>

<i> and nothing substantial against
 the Governor has emerged.</i>

<i> - Why should people vote
 for Governor Redding next week?</i>

<i> - Governor Redding
 has sacrificed everything</i>

<i> for us to move forward
 as a society.</i>

<i> He will do whatever it takes
 to lead this country</i>

<i> and I proudly stand with him.</i>

And we're out.

All right, let's reset
for the next shot.

Can I get escort
for talent off set?

Thank you very much.

I can't keep doing this.

It's been eight months.

I've been giving you
everything.

Rifling through building files,

photos of restricted areas.

Now is the time to focus
and do our jobs.

What do you even do?

I'm out there every day

destroying my reputation
for a few bread crumbs.

I'm putting my life
on the line,

and it feels like
I'm the only one!

I'm sorry.

It's just--
this is eating away at me.

If you stop now, it's over.

I need to know Corrine
and Joey are taken care of.

I will see to it myself.

We now believe that

the files are on
Georgina's private computer.

If you can get access, we can
get what we need and pull you.

No one is allowed
inside that office

without Georgina present.

We didn't say
this was gonna be easy.

Find a way in.

If anyone can do it, you can.

How am I going to
get access to her computer?

They all have password locks

or need special key card access.

Jean's a digital safe cracker.

This provides both
the clearance and the file space

needed to secure
any and all files

from Georgina's database.

The election is next week.

It's now or never, Laina.

And, also,
we know about your friend.

What friend?

The one who's been
at every meeting

for the last eight months.

He's listening in right now.

Kellan, you can take off
the glasses now.

<i> - No habla inglés.</i>

My opponent doesn't want
to invest in the future.

He thinks things are going fine
just the way they are.

And I'm here to tell you,
they aren't.

Your state has more students
with higher test scores

than in the history of Vermont,

and your entire campaign
is about rolling back

all that progress.

That's a good point,
but I refuse to--

"That's a good point"?

We're never gonna hear that
in the debate, Alan.

You mind if
I took a brief recess?

No.
Go ahead, Congressman.

And, please, take your time.

Let's have Thomas flown in.
The former energy secretary?

Yeah, he won't let up
on anybody.

Thomas Hausman?
That's no good.

You need to get used to
debating a woman.

I'll have Lindsay get you
a list of names.

I can do it.

I'll debate you.

Well, I appreciate
the sentiment, Laina,

but we're looking for someone
a little more qualified.

The thinning
is a barbaric program

that blames students
for the failures

of a broken education system.

But it sure makes it easier
to put the blame on students

than having to look
higher on the totem pole.

Why not?

Our teachers
are the finest in the world.

And if you're gonna
blame them because

a few students are unwilling
to push themselves

to realize their full potential,

well, I won't stand for that.

But you will stand
for a program that preys on

the most disadvantaged
students in our society,

students who are
less likely to pass

because of their
socioeconomic background.

Whereas those born with
a silver spoon in their mouths

never truly have to worry
about whether or not

they get to see
the next school year.

I think we all know
that my son had to worry.

Blake was one
of the kindest souls

I've ever had
the pleasure of knowing.

And he failed the test
on purpose,

to protest this rigged system.

You tried to bail him out,

but you got caught,

and you threw him under the bus

to advance
your political career.

Is there enough room
for the American people

under that bus?

How was that?

Uh, that was good.

Yeah, it was good.
Really good.

I'm not done with you yet.

You're not worthy!
Stand up, man, let's go!

You're not worthy!

You just don't

Punch him in the face, Cage!

He was asking about you.

Who?

Cage.

He's waiting for you to slip,

Why hasn't anyone

I don't know, bro.

Don't look like a bitch to me.

He's not worthy!

He's not worthy!

Yeah.

Get this parasite out of here!

Isn't anybody gonna help him?

Not till after the fight.

Hey.
Oh, come on.

Are you really gonna
make me take him?

Let's see it!

Come on, let's go.

Who's next on the list?
Next victim!

If you win, you lead.

Who's got it, baby?

Who's going next?

Sooner or later, Redding,

you'll be in here.

Sooner or later.

Come on, daddy's boy,

Let's see the daddy's boy!

<i> - Curfew is now in effect.</i>

Eight?

How about this?

Nine.

This thing just won't heal.

Blake, what
are they doing to you?

I fell in the shower again.

What's the deal with her?

She refused to work.

There is no reintroduction,

is there?

Do you know that we're all here
against our will?

The law is the law.

But they tell everyone
that we're dead.

I can't be having
this conversation.

Help me get out of here, Doc.

Doc, please.

I'll see you in a few weeks.

Let's go, Blake.

On way to living quarters, King.

Hey.

Hi.
Hi.

Have you talked
to Ellie recently?

Yeah, but
she's always with Cage,

so not for long.

I need you to get
a message to her, from me.

You spend so much time
caring for her.

I think it's time you let
somebody take care of you.

Tell Ellie to come
to the cage match tomorrow.

It's important.

This isn't gonna take more
than five minutes, is it?

I'll talk fast.
Shoot.

Okay, so I was looking into
the Vista Point story--

Oh, my God, Kellan,
you have a new angle

on this story every week.

This one's different.
Five minutes.

You have one minute.

I practiced it for five.

Okay, I'll talk very fast.

The machines the T-2401 tests
are performed on

<i> are made by Assuru Global.</i>

both: But we already knew that.
Right, exactly.

And Assuru Global has been
touting their massive increase

in production, which
I thought I had figured out

when I bum-rushed
Georgina Preston at her office.

You did what?

<i> - Where you headed, Georgina?
 - Shareholders' meeting.</i>

<i> We're talking about
 how Assuru has tripled</i>

<i> its production
 and is on its way</i>

<i> to having
 a record-shattering year.</i>

How could you have
increased production?

You laid off
half your workforce.

Obviously our young friend

hasn't heard of automation.

Excuse me.

I know, it was premature,
you know,

but that gave me everything.

Automation.

<i> If they're making
 more tablets now,</i>

<i> then they're using a lot more
 machines to make them, right?</i>

So I dug up their expenditures.

How did you get those?

I have a friend... who hacks.

<i> Not important.</i>

But I found that they
are paying for machines

that they're not
actually receiving.

So I took a tour
of the new campus,

which is really nice.

Assuru Global
is the industry leader

in cutting-edge
consumer electronics.

<i> - And you should really see
 their manufacturing room.</i>

Really, you should.
Because I didn't.

<i> Because they don't have one.</i>

<i> I walked the entire campus
 with a pedometer.</i>

And if you were to fill
the entire thing with machines,

even in the places I walked--
which had none--

<i> you wouldn't be able
 to get to half</i>

<i> of the output
 that they're shipping.</i>

So they're outsourcing.

Right,
I though the same thing.

<i> But according
 to their expenditures,</i>

<i> they're also
 regularly "in-sourcing"</i>

<i> 100 million pounds
 of food per year</i>

<i> from a company called TXPAK.</i>

Military rations.

Let me just make sure
I got this right.

TXPAK is the sole distributor
of MREs

for the entire U.S. military?
<i> - One of three, actually.</i>

<i> We're very proud to be one
 of three major suppliers</i>

<i> for heat-and-serve
 meal packages.</i>

The average human eats
three pounds of food per day.

<i> They have enough food to feed
 100,000 people per year.</i>

And that's just
what I've found so far.

What are you saying?

I think they're using
failed students

to make tablets
and phones and whatever,

and I think it's all connected
to Vista Point.

How?

Have you ever looked at

the blueprints
for the original build?

<i> - Of course not.</i>

<i> - I just did.
 Massive vents, by the way.</i>

You could fit a human in there.

They also have
special designated areas

<i> for freight elevators.</i>

And these elevators only go
from the first floor down.

15 stories,
and--and they go to nothing,

nothing that's on the plans.

So I say we call the cops.

Hi, Brad.
Now's a good time.

Oh, my God.

What you have
is circumstantial.

It's a conspiracy theory.

No photos, no videos,
no proof?

No story.

So you want me
to get video?

Yes, we are working on
confirming that interview.

Of an illegal,
underground slave operation

run by the biggest corporation
in the world,

which also happens to be
the single largest donor

to Governor Redding's
campaign for president.

Can you get a truck
ready for me?

Super.

Shut the door
on your way out.

I'm only 18.

It's my first job
out of high school,

but you got it, boss.

Wish I got thinned.

I don't mean that.

Maybe I do.

Yeah.

Blake?

Shh.

We don't have much time.

I can't keep doing this.
You have to.

You're so close.

Don't give up now.

What's up?

I got some brews.

Paid a homeless dude
50 bucks for this.

Kellan,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

It's 2:00 in the morning?

That means it's time to party!

Whoo!
Let's cruise and do some shots!

So, you know, I was hanging out
at my place, alone,

and I was thinking,

"Do you know who I want
to hang out with?

My best friend, Laina."
Kellan.

Now, full disclosure,
I drank some of them,

so you have
some catching up to do.

Kellan, what the hell?
They're sleeping.

Yeah, "what the hell"
is right.

We've gotta get some tunes
in here, it's too quiet.

Oh!

Kellan, stop.

Kellan, knock it off.
Kellan!

Kellan, why in the world--

<i> - All workers, return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

<i> All workers, return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

<i> All workers, return
 to living and dining quarters.</i>

Hey.
<i> - Remember: be worthy.</i>

Heather.
Hey.

Have you seen Blake?

I don't know how
to tell you this...

What?

Did something happen?

Blake, he--

he doesn't want
to see you anymore.

I--I didn't--
Ellie.

You should just move on.

I know that this is
a terrible thing to say,

but you have to live your life
without Blake Redding.

I'm sorry.

Okay.

It's done.
She gonna be okay?

Yeah, she'll be fine.

So you're gonna put in
a good word for me, right?

Absolutely.

I'm very close with Mason.

He takes my recommendations

for a reintroduction seriously.

You did good.

<i> - Dean Redding believes in
 a strong and prosperous nation,</i>

<i> creating
 unlimited possibilities</i>

<i> for its best
 and brightest citizens.</i>

<i> While Elaine Davis
 wants to live</i>

<i> in a country of
 poor, uneducated losers</i>

<i> and sink America's ranking</i>

<i> to the bottom
 of global competition.</i>

<i> If you want
 to continue winning,</i>

<i> vote Dean Redding.</i>

I'm Dean Redding,
and I approve this message.

Okay, you guys.

Everything's going
to be okay.

Just be good to Miss Cole.

Okay.
I love you both so much.

I love you, too.

You ready?

Hey, guys.
I have breakfast ready for you.

Hurry before it's cold.

So this is our last chance
at this, right?

You're going to be fine.

I'll be unreachable
for a little bit

while we get them to safety.

Once you get the information,
all you have to do

is get it to Jack,
and you're home free.

And no matter what happens,

Corrine and Joey
are going to be safe.

We'll be seeing you.

Okay, you can eat those
on the way.

Let's go.

Just down here a little.

This way, guys.
Come on.

Just wait here.

Come on.

Everything's gonna be okay.

I've got a good feeling.

Why are you doing this?

My map is telling me
this is a faster route.

No, I mean,

why are you helping?

My little sister, Kelli,

uh, she was dyslexic.

Everything took
a little more time.

Every day after school,
I would stay and help her,

make sure she didn't
fall behind.

Senior year came around, and,

you know, I got too wrapped up
into partying,

and overconfident with
the idea that she would be fine.

And I started
to let things slip.

She was taken from me.

And not a day goes by
that I don't wish

I had done more.

That's why I'm here.

Well, if this works,
no one will ever have to

go through something
like that again.

Good luck in there.

You too.

<i> - It's gonna be
 an exciting race, for sure.</i>

<i> It's really, really difficult
 to know who's gonna</i>

come out on top here,
so we're interested to see

how the day will play out.

Bathroom?

Ma'am, this is
a secure facility.

I'll have to escort you.

This way.

Miss?

The bathroom.

If you don't want to work
on the line,

then you work in here with me.

Cage! Cage! Cage! Cage!

Cage! Cage! Cage! Cage!

I don't want
to work on the line.

I'm gonna enjoy this.

Someone get ole limpy up here.

Now this is entertainment.

He was faking it!

He was faking it!

When you go down,

you're gonna stay down.

If you go down,

I lead The Worthy.

I never go down.

Ellie Harper,
you are in direct violation

of Section 6 work order.

Proceed to your workstation now.

Come on!

Yeah, Cage!
Get him!

No response?
Nothing.

She won't get up.

I'm getting out of here!

Take her down!

Take her down.
No! No!

Come on.
No!

Lock her down.
Get off of me!

Let me go!
That's it, guys.

Hey, back to your sector!

Oh, my God.
No!

Stop!
Ellie.

Cage!

Get up, Cage, come on!

No!

Come on, Cage, get up!

Blake! Blake! Blake! Blake!

Blake! Blake! Blake!

Blake! Blake! Blake!

The new leader of The Worthy!

It's Ellie.

Everything you've been told
about this place is a lie.

There were no killed students.

They did it for cheap labor
to help Assuru make products.

So...

there's no reintroduction?

No.

The alarm was for Ellie.

And I can get to her.

But I'm gonna need all of
your help to get her out.

No one's ever
gotten out before.

Then this is gonna
end quickly,

but I have to try.

What do you need us to do?

We just received audio
of presidential candidate

Elaine Davis having a sordid
conversation with a staffer.

<i> - We have to warn you,
 there is some</i>

<i> crude language
 within the tape.</i>

<i> - Oh, come the on,
 Meredith,</i>

<i> voters have their head up
 their ass.</i>

<i> They shouldn't even have
 the right to vote, because</i>

<i> when they do, they just
 this country up.</i>

<i> Everyone between
 California and New York</i>

<i> are dumb
 for brains.</i>

<i> It's not even exaggeration.</i>

<i> It's true.</i>

This is a game-changer.

I mean,
this could cost her Iowa.

Is this getting played
everywhere?

Yeah.
Everywhere.

Oh.

Whoever leaked this,
I love you.

<i> - She was very...</i>

You okay in there?

Miss Michaels?

Oh, my God.

Blake.

Georgina, Frank Paulsen's
calling for you.

I left something in my office.

Excuse me.
Miss Preston?

The Governor would like
to see you right away.

Give me a minute.

No.

He said it's urgent.

That's excellent.
Thank you so much for that.

What?
Beg your pardon?

You told Jack you needed me
for something urgent.

No.
No, I didn't.

Yeah, go ahead.
Just take it off.

Take the whole thing off,
I don't care.

Everything okay?

You didn't respond.

I had to use the bathroom.

Laina.

What happened to you?

Laundry day.

Laundry.

I've never done my own laundry.

Go, go, go.
Just--don't stop.

Is the shuttle on time?

It leaves out of Matamoros
at 6:00.

We'll make if we go now.

I'll lead the way.

<i> - I'm sorry,
 the number you have--</i>

<i> - You've reached
 Agent Joanne Morris.</i>

<i> Please leave a message.</i>
This is Laina Michaels.

I need to see you right away.

Got a worker down.

Oh, chief, he's bleeding.
You gotta do something.

Take him to
the infirmary. Let's go.

<i> - Production ceased
 until further notice.</i>

Watch where you're going,
Freeman.

Don't touch me, bro.

I'm not your bro.

That's right.

'Cause you're my bitch.
Bitch.

Yeah.
Bitch!

Fight!

Let's go,
let's go!

Take out the boys!

Seal all exits.

Code 695.

All DPC Guards report
to the mess hall.

<i> Code 695!</i>

I got an injured student

here at the East Corridor.

You know what to do.

Sorry for all the theatrics.

I don't know
who might be after you.

Blake Redding is alive.
What?

I saw him.

Assuru Global
has a remote complex

where failed students
are being put to work

in some kind of labor camps.

Who else knows about this?

You're my first call.

Is your theory backed up
by evidence?

Here.
It's all here.

We're gonna have to hide you.

They might be onto you already.

I need your phone, keys, wallet,

anything they might have
bugged you with.

More importantly, your family.

Where are your siblings?
They're with a friend.

You don't have friends
anymore.

Who's this friend?

Maggie Cole, their teacher.

She's taking them out
of the country.

How?
I don't know.

Through some kind of
tunnel system to the border.

Okay.

They're safe.
We can work with that.

Do you have any
other devices on you?

That's it.
Good.

Turn around.
What?

Walk to the edge.

Wait.

That sign says "El Toro."

We're going the wrong way.

Joey!

John.

They found my kids.

No!

Please!
Please!

You're with Assuru?

Kind of.

<i> - Help!</i>

Blake.

It's way harder for a coroner
to explain bullets in your back

from an unmarked weapon

than an overworked employee
cracking under pressure

and taking the plunge.

But I'll leave it up to you.

Damn it!

<i> - She may just
 handed this race over</i>

<i> to Governor Redding.</i>

Shit.

It's okay.

You're safe now.

We just have to hurry.

Come on.

We don't have much time.

You might want
to look away for this.

Oh, no.

Oh, God...

What are you doing?

It was all a lie.

Who?
Who put you up to this?

Who put you up to
this?

Redding.

<i> - California then
 goes to Davis, but...</i>

Shit.

<i> It may be too late
 in the game.</i>

<i> I mean, what's happening here
 in the Midwest...</i>

Hi.

Sorry.

<i> I credit a man
 who will correct his mistakes</i>

<i> and own up to them.</i>

<i> Governor Redding
 is that kind of man.</i>

<i> - BNC can now confirm</i>

<i> that North Carolina has gone
 to Governor Redding.</i>

Congratulations!
Thank you, Donna.

Thank you, thank you.

Barbara, thank you.

It's still early.
It's still early.

How could this have happened?

My property was stolen
and you did nothing?

Where's the girl?

Has anyone found the girl?

I'll handle this myself.

Is this a bad time?

You have a high-tech program
that can

extract data from
damaged drives, right?

For water damage?

Oh, yeah.

Oh.

It's 2040.
It's the best we've got.

You don't have something
more cutting-edge?

Oh, wait, I got it.

One sec.

This is the latest
in fan technology.

Clearly.

So you've been good?

Okay, here goes nothing.

It worked.

I, uh--

I gotta make a copy of this.

This is way too big to have
on one waterlogged drive.

Thank you, Kellan.

You're literally the only person
I can trust anymore.

Well, until Blake comes back.

Kellan, I--
No, it's--it's cool.

We're good.

I've, uh, moved on.

Actually, I'm really into
this one coworker of mine.

It's getting pretty serious.

She's a little more into me
than I'm into her,

but I'm warming to her.

Isn't Wendy married?

Oh, she is.

But we can trust her.

And once she sees
what you've got,

she won't be able
to ignore this anymore.

Or me.

All right.
We're all set.

Perfect,
I'll bring it to Wendy.

Whoa, no.
No way.

They're looking for you.

Just stay here and lay low.

I'll take this to Wendy
and she'll get it live.

You're, uh--
you're gonna be okay.

Thank you.

Oh, and whatever you do,

don't look through
my browser history.

No, I need you to promise me

you won't look through
my browser history.

You know what,
I'm just gonna, um--

I'm just gonna
delete it quickly.

Can you close your eyes?

Are you serious?
Please.

Okay.

See you soon.

Where are we going?

Home.

Wait!

Go for it.
Okay.

Did she say
where they were going?

Georgina, what's going on?

The drive is all that matters.
The girl is of no further use.

Thank you, Joanna.

Who was that?

None of your concern, honey.
Sir.

Sir, that was Ohio.

You're over 270.
What?

May I be the first

to congratulate you,
Mister President.

We did it?

Yes, we did it.
We did it? We did it!

We did it!

We did it, everybody!
We did it!

Outstanding!

Medical staffers.
Where did they go?

Uh, southwest corridor.

Thanks.
Are you okay?

Yeah.

Let's go.

Where is it?

Where is the drive?

Go to hell.

Where is the drive?

Where is it?

Is it with your sister?

Your brother?

'Cause that's where
I'm going next.

Oh, my--oh, my God.

Go.

Hey, Marvin,
did you get an ID

on the car-bombing victim?

Wendy.

Oh, my God...

We just received word
that Senator Elaine Davis

did call Governor Redding
to concede the election.

Which means that
we are only moments away from

hearing the President Elect's
acceptance speech.

<i> - This is amazing.</i>

<i> - What a historic night indeed.</i>

Where's Laina?

She's coming.

Ellie.
Come on.

Can I help you?

I need to see Wendy Banks,
please.

Do you have an appointment,
or...

You know what,
I'll just go get her.

Oh, my God.

You did it.
We did it.

Oh, my God.

Yeah, they must have
tracking devices

on all of the failed students.

Do you know where this is?

The coordinates.
Right there.

Kellan was right.

We have to
get this out tonight.

Marvin,
I need two vans and a chopper.

They're all booked out.
It's election night.

Forget election night!

I need a chopper!
Now!

There's nothing for miles.

Which way are we going?

To hell!

This time...

you'll die for real.

I'd hate to be Elaine Davis
right about now.

So I implemented
a few last-minute changes

to your acceptance speech.
Here you go.

Changes?
Uh, yeah.

Georgina's team requested that

we omit your son
from the speech.

I'm sorry,
she found it too macabre.

Excuse me.

Carl--Carl, what's up?

We're about to go on.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow--
slow down.

What?

I'll call you back.

<i> - We're getting breaking news,
 folks,</i>

<i> right here, live, at the BNC.</i>

<i> Blake Redding is alive.</i>

<i> I repeat,
 Blake Redding is alive.</i>

Blake?

<i> - We're gonna go live to</i>

<i> a helicopter
 in the Texas desert</i>

<i> and you will see
 Blake Redding is there...</i>

What is this?
I--I don't know.

This isn't very funny.
What is this?

Calm down, sir.

Somebody tell me
what the fuck is going on!

<i> - ...and the legitimacy</i>

<i> of the entire
 thinning program.</i>

Dean.

Dean?

It's time to make your speech.

Just go out there and
smile for the cameras.

You're on, Mister President.

You guys,
check the fire escape.

Out there in two,
three minutes, got it?

Thank you.

Hi.

Hi.

From this moment,

united, determined,

we move forward together.

I've worked in PR
my entire professional life.

There is no way
we can spin this.

We don't have to.

Look, I don't mean
to be a downer, here,

but all of this
is extremely illegal.

Not anymore.

Advanced systems.

Give me the list of everyone who
has ever opposed the thinning.

<i> We can't break the law,
 because now</i>

<i> we are the law.</i>

Moving in.
Moving in.

Blake Redding.

Laina Michaels.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

Ellie Harper,
you're all under arrest.

No, stop, stop!

Where are they taking us?

This doesn't add up.

Assuru already had access

to everyone's locations,
cameras, keystrokes.

They had to go through
the courts to spy on a civilian.

It'll only take
the wrong person in power

to end freedom as we know it.

We have to stop them.

I don't think we can do--

Come on.
Jack?

We gotta go.

Who are you?

I'm FBI, come on.

There we go.

We gotta go, now.

Where?

We're going to war.
