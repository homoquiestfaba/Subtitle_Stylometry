[inhales deeply, exhales]

[knocking at door]

[knocking continues]
Just a second!

Okay, I'm just
trying to help you.


[man on phone] <i>Where are you?</i>
Almost home.

<i>I told you
I had a dinner meeting.</i>

I know.

<i>I'm turning onto
the street now, okay?</i>

<i>Do you see me?</i>

Jesus, slow down!

You can always just leave
him in the apartment.

He's a big boy,
you know?

Leave him
in the apartment?

Is that how you want to
spend your week together?

Come on, baby.

Hold on a second.

This is for you.

Go upstairs, baby.
Can I see...

Upstairs, Thomas.

Gee.
See you later, pal.


[door closes]

Full custody?

It's with visitation. I'm not
trying to take him out of your life.

You know this was coming.

You have no grounds.

I want what's best for my son.

Our son.
Don't we both want that?

We do alternate weeks.
We agreed.

Yeah, we've been through
all this.

In high school,
he's going to need a solid base.


Half the kids in that school
have divorced parents.

Half the kids
in the fucking world.

Yep. Yeah,

but you haven't been
doing so great.

Wow.

He feels
your darkness, Lizzie.


My darkness?


I know you want him in as
stable a situation as possible.




[door opens]

I have to work
half a day tomorrow.

Again?

Yeah. So Grandma
will take you to Sam's party.

And I'll come later.


Do you want to do this?

Can I?
Yeah.

Now just take
the price tag off.

I'm gonna get us
some dinner ready, okay?

Yeah.

[music playing]
[children cheering]

Hey, Mom, can I have
a party like this someday?

Uh, sure. Why not?

Really?
Maybe even in a house like this.


seven, six, five, four,

three, two, one.

Ready or not,
here I come!

Boo!
[gasps]

Oh, no!
Oh, don't panic. It's all right.

Can't sit back
and watch an innocent skirt die.

Oh.
Here you go.

I'm Claire.

I'm Lizzie. Thanks.

No worries.

Who was that little girl?


Really pretty.

Big brown eyes.

Long hair.
She was in a pink dress.

I think that's Jeremy's sister.

Do you know her name?


Jeremy's little sister.

No.

No, why would you?

Come on.

Let's have an early one, love.
Teeth, toilet, bed.

[breathes shakily]


<i>Ready or not, here I come!</i>


[exhales sharply]



It's so good.
I'm so excited.

I haven't seen her for ages.

Bye!
Bye, Lola!


Hi!
[Lola] Hi!

Come on!
[Jeremy] Yeah, coming.

[car engine starts]


for afternoon tea?

Muffins?
[woman] Oh, yeah?

[Lola] Yeah.
[woman] Muffins, huh?

[car honks]
[Lola] Yes.

wing, which is

sometimes where you play, I know...
[woman chuckles]

...you've gotta cross the ball...
Hey, guys.

Oh, hello.
[man] Hi.

Good. You started without me.

When the roast comes out of the
oven, we eat.

We're starving.

Hey, trouble.

You taking it easy
on Mom and Dad?

Yeah.
[man] We'll talk tactics later, okay?

[Thomas] Cool.
[Lizzie sighs]

There you go.

Oh, thanks.

Mm-hmm.

Hey, listen, um,

can you
have Thomas tomorrow night?

Of course, <i>gumman.</i>

And what have you got on?

Oh.

I know it's kind of last minute,
but, um, I have a date.

Oh. Like to stay tomorrow, Tommy?
Yeah, sure.

Tell me, who is he?
How did you meet?

Alice set it up.
It's just... It's just a date.

Mm. Really?

Everything starts with a date.

Good for you, Lizzie.

[doors lock]

[Lola humming]

[Lola gasps]
[Lizzie gasps]



Mummy!

Mommy!

Mom!

I've got you!

Hold onto me!

Go away!

I'm just trying to help!

No!


[gasping, breathing heavily]

[birds chirping]

Do you want to
light the candles?

We need to remember her.



Hi.

Claire. It's Claire, right?

Yeah.
Sorry, I forget your name.

Um, oh, Lizzie.
From Sam's birthday party.

You saved my skirt.

Oh, yes. Hi.
Hi.

I saw this place listed online,
and I thought I'd check it out.

What a coincidence it's you.
I know. [chuckles]

So you guys are leaving?


We're moving
all the way over to Perth.

It's all happening really fast.

Are you in the market?

Well, I mean,
if the right thing comes around.

Just love this neighborhood.
Yeah, it's great.

Thomas. I got the new <i>Act Of War.</i>
Wanna play?

Oh, Mom, please?
Oh, Thomas, I'm sure they are...

It's totally fine.
He can stay and play.

Oh, no, I don't wanna impose.
Oh, it's okay.

It's like the planet's
arranging a play date.

Please, Mom?
Can he?

I mean, if it's no problem. I...

Sure, why not? Um... But I won't stay,
though. I've got some errands to do.

You go do them.
I'll keep my eye on these two.

Okay, so what if I'm back in,
let's say, an hour?

Yeah, great. We'll be here.
Okay.

Let me take that, baby.

Have fun.
I will. See ya, Mom.

Bye.
Bye!

[cutlery clattering]

[sirens wailing]


Hi.
Hi.

I hope he wasn't
too much trouble.

Not at all.
Thomas, your mum's here!

Hmm. Oh, wow.

Look at those ceilings.

I would totally invite you in,

but I have to take Lola
to dance practice.

Oh, I didn't mean to impose...

If I wasn't in such a
rush, I would.

I was just thinking
maybe I should

bring my husband around,
to come and look at the place.

[footsteps approaching]
[Thomas] Hey.

Or should I
go through an agency, or...

Uh, no, no,
we can just go direct

if you're really interested.

Yeah, that would be great.

Okay, uh, why don't you

put your number in my phone,
and I can text you some times

for later this week?
Sure.

And bring Thomas.
[beeping]

He and Jeremy
had a terrific time.

Don't forget your swimsuit.
You can test out the pool.

Cool. Thank you.
Yeah?

Thank you. See you.
Bye.

See you.
Cool, see you.

So you're half Swedish,
half English?

Yeah.

My mom is Swedish.
My dad is English.

I grew up in Stockholm.

have you been single?

Oh, I don't
think of myself that way.

I thought you were...

Oh, I am divorced.

It's just, you know...

I'm kind of still...
in the middle of it.

I didn't mean to...

No, no, it's fine.

I mean,
it's been a while. I...

I should, you know...

move on.

Mm-hmm.

Did Alice tell you
I have children?

Uh, she mentioned a son.

Yeah, Thomas.

I'd like to meet him.

Yeah?
Yeah. Uh...

Uh, you have another?

No, just Thomas.

I thought
you said "children."


Thomas is a lot to handle,
believe me.

It's...

As I said,
it's been a while since I...

socialized.

[breathing heavily]


Lizzie, let me look at you.

Let me look at you.

Look at me.
Let me look at you.

Argh.
[Lizzie] Stop! Stop.

[continues moaning]

[breathes heavily]

Okay?

[exhales, sniffles]

I'm sorry.
Lizzie, don't... What?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Did I do something wrong?

[knocking at door]

Hi.
Hi.

Sorry,
we're a bit early.

Oh, that's okay.
Come on in.

Hi.
Hi, Thomas.

Jeremy's in the pool already.

Where's your husband?

Oh, he couldn't make it.
Last minute thing.

That's too bad.

I guess we're the ones
that make the decisions anyway.

Yeah.
I'll show you the main part of the house,

but that's our au pair's room,
and bathroom here.

[children laughing]
This is our piano room.

Oh, wow.

You've got great taste.

We travel,
so I'm always picking things up.

Living, dining.

The open plan was really important to us.
Mmm.

[Lola] Is this better?
[Claire] We put in the pool for the kids.

It's a luxury, but we're hooked.

Would you like to see upstairs?

Yeah.

So what do you do?

I'm with Arlin Naturals.

The one in Town Center.
I'm the manager.

Oh, nice.

This is the master.

Oh, it's beautiful.

Do you like it? Your job?

Yeah. I do.

Spare room.
It's great for guests.

Mind you, sometimes I end up
in here if Bernie's snoring.

[both chuckle]

And this is Jeremy's room.

It's a bloody mess.

It'd be great for Thomas.
Yeah.


Oh, I love this one.

We were at my parents' house.
Jeremy was four.


God, I was huge,
and I was only six months pregnant there.

Do you have other kids?

No, just Thomas.

And this is Lola's room.

There's plenty of space
for extra cupboards.


She's seven.

And already a full wardrobe.
[children chattering]

Girls will be girls, right?

Is she okay with the move?

Oh, yeah.
It's all she talks about.

You know, Bernie told her there's a unicorn
petting zoo in Perth, so... [chuckles]

...now we've got a double trauma
coming up in the next couple of years

between Santa Claus
and now the unicorns.

[Bernard] Where are my monsters?
Oh, speak of the devil.

It's the unicorn whisperer. Come and meet him.
[Lola] Hi, Daddy!

I know it sounds really silly,
but I really hope you buy the place.

It would be in good hands.
[Lola giggling]

My God, this place
has been so good to us.

Maybe it'll be good for you too.

Yeah.

[Bernard] Hello.
Hi.

Lola, say hi to Lizzie.

Hi.
Hi.

I watched you swim.
You're really good.

Thanks.

Buy it, Mum!
[all laugh]

Well, that settles it, then.
Meet the new owner.

Well, we'll see, we'll see.
Um, can I use the loo?

Yeah, down the hall on your left.
Thanks.

What's your name, buster?

Uh, Thomas.

Now can I get you a drink?

Yes, please. Just water.

Not too cold for you out there, is it?

[breathing deeply]

[Claire] How many have you had today?
[Jeremy] None!

[all laughing]
[Bernard] Put them back. We're on a budget, boys.

Don't touch, okay?
Just chew on some celery.


Hey.

Can I come in?

Okay.

Wow.

You have such a nice room.

Aren't you gonna miss it?

A little.
Hmm.

Hey, I know.

Oh, look.

What?

Don't you think
we look alike?

She seems great.
How long you two been friends?

No, I barely know her.
The kids play soccer together.

We could invite her
to stay for dinner.

Yeah. We could.

I was kinda hoping we might
get the kids to bed early

and have a date night.

Thomas!
Time to go home!

You have
the perfect layout.

[Jeremy] Ask your mum.
Thank you.

Can I go ice-skating
on Wednesday with Jeremy?

Oh, Jeremy's obsessed.
Please?

Baby, I think it's a family day.

No, no, it's fine.
No, he can come. Of course.

You sure?
Yeah, of course.

Okay, sure. Why not? Um, sounds like fun.
Go and get your stuff.

[boys giggling]


Thanks for showing me the house.
I'm seriously thinking about it.

Well, we'd seriously
like you to buy it.


There's nothing to say.

Well, are you
going to see him again?

He was okay,
but nothing special.

Trust me. For a woman
who married your father,

you don't need special.


Very amusing.


It's just important
to have relationships in life.

I know.

You're either at that job

or stuck in the apartment.

It's not enough.

We're gonna buy my friend's
house, so we won't be stuck.

Oh, really?
Yeah.

Yeah, I was just looking around,
seeing what's out there.

Sure.
It's big. Really big. And there's a pool.

We used to do that.
Window shop.

Yeah, I know I can't afford
it, but it's fun to look.

You... You said
we might buy it.

Yeah, maybe one day, baby.

You're such a liar!

Thomas. That's enough.

I hate the apartment.
I can hear you clean your teeth.

And I can hear you pee.
So what?

And I can hear you cry
all the time.

I wanna live with Dad.
[Lizzie] Thomas.

You're always saying you'll get
things done which you never do.

Oh, that's not true.
You know that's not true.

Yes, it is.
And you're always sad.

I'm not sad.
I'm not fucking sad.

Lizzie.
I'm getting it done, okay? I'm getting it done.

You never get anything done!

[Lena] Now now.
[Carl] Come back here!

Dad!
Control him!

[door slams]
It's okay, baby!

It's not okay.
And you shouldn't be swearing at him.


[sniffling]
[door opens]


I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about the house.

I got excited,
and it was a dumb idea.

I thought
we were gonna live there.

I'm sorry, baby.

I...

I know I'm not always
the best mom.

But, um...
there's just a lot going on now.

And I'm doing my best.

I'm doing my best, baby.

I love you.

I love you so much,
baby.

When you hurt,
I hurt too.

I wanna live with Dad.

Well, you do.
Half the time.

Not like that.

Baby, we're gonna
work it out.

It's gonna be okay.

It's not.

Go and get your stuff, baby.


I'm fine.

[Lena speaking Swedish]

I don't know why.

I just feel so fuck...

[exhales sharply]

Oh...

<i>Ã„lskling,</i> you don't
seem to be... coping.

Because before when you were...

Stop treating me
like a child, okay?

I'm an adult.
Of course you are.

I just had a moment.

We're just concerned.

Just stop fucking being
concerned about me all the time!

It's driving me crazy!

For Christ's sake, Lizzie,
this isn't just about you!

You have a son.

Because you're on edge
all the time,

you're bad-tempered with him,

you're forgetful.

It isn't a healthy
environment for a child.

you were doing better.

Well...
[exhales sharply] ...so did I.

[soft music playing]

My parents just called.
Thomas is sick.


Really? Well,
what does he have?

Or is he just plain sick?

He's vomiting
and has a fever.

I'm sorry,
but I really gotta go.


For God's sake, Courtney,

her kid is sick.
Just let her go.

She can go.
Of course she can go.

Thanks,
I appreciate it.

[children chattering]

He skates well.

He comes
with his dad sometimes.

Jeremy is not... bad.

Oh, he tries.

How long
have you lived here?

About ten years.

So they're both born here?

Uh, yeah. Yeah,
both at Landry Maternity.

[phone ringing]
Oh, excuse me.

Hi, Mum.

Yeah, we're just
at the ice skating rink.

Yeah,
they're doing well.

Oh, yeah, we'll be over
on the weekend for sure.

Yeah, we can bring some more.
[Thomas] Come on, Lola.

Yeah, we can't wait to see you.

Hey.


No, no, I only just started
packing the kitchen.

Yeah, I only just
got a few boxes.

If you bend your knees a little
bit, you'll get steadier.

[Lizzie gasps]
[Lola giggles]

Want to hold my hand?

Okay. Let's speed up.


Keep looking ahead.

Should we try something?
You go in front.


[Lizzie gasps]

Shit!

Lola!

[gasps]
Lola!

[Lizzie] Oh, my God.
No, don't... Don't touch her.

Are you okay?
Are you okay, honey?

[groans]
[Lizzie] I'm so sorry.

Shh. It's okay. It's okay.
Is she okay?

The guy just shot out of nowhere.
Such an idiot.

You were obviously
going too fast.


It's just a bump.
It's just a bump, honey.

I am so, so sorry.

You have a tough little
trooper right there.

I wanna make it up to you guys.

No, it's fine.
It's okay.

Um, I can take them off
your hands this weekend.

I'm with Dad this weekend.

Or any weekday afternoon.

Um, you know, they have
so much going on already

with the move
and everything, so...

Sure.
Whatever works best for you.

Yeah, we can...

We'll just play it by ear.

Come on, Jeremy.
You ready? Let's go.

Okay, see you.
See you later.

[exhales sharply]


[toilet flushes]


Much better.

I try to relax more.

The other day I played hooky from work.
I went ice skating with Thomas.

[man chuckles] Well,
your secret is safe with me.


And how are you both doing?

He's great.

I mean the two of you.

Yeah, you know,
we're, uh, we're good.

We're...
We're doing great.


So do you find yourself
thinking less about Rosie?

Mm, yeah.
Yeah, less and less.

And the medication.

Do you feel it's helping?

Absolutely. Yeah.

All right, that one's definitely coming.
[giggles] Yeah.

Care Bear. Still coming?

Yeah.
All right. What about Mr. Dinosaur?

Yeah. Yeah.
Are you sure?

I don't know!
Yeah.

[both laugh]

You have too many toys.

Lola, can you grab me a glass of
water from the kitchen, please?

Yeah.


[woman] Just turn around.
[girl] It's so tight...

[woman 2] Need a couple
more pins in there.

[girl 2] Mom, that's enough.

You look like a real ballerina.

I'm a bit scared,
Mum.

Well, it's okay
to be a bit scared.

But look, all the other girls
don't seem nervous.

Well, I am.

Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm going to be sitting in the audience,

cheering you on with your dad and with Jezzy, yeah?
[bell rings]

[woman] Come on, girls!
[girl] Oh, let's go.

Okay, go on. Go on.

No, stay with me.

But look,
all the other mums are going.

Go get 'em.

You are going to be
so amazing, yeah?

You're my brave girl,
and you're going to be great,

and then we're going to be with
you right afterwards, yeah?

Okay, go on.

Come on! Let's go.

[ballet music playing]

Sorry. Sorry.

She all right?
Yeah, she's fine.

Oh, my God.


Hey, Lola.

You okay?

Wow.

Oh, your shoes.

They're so pretty.

I got them for my birthday.
Really?

Hmm.

When is your birthday?

I'm on next.



I'm here.



What's she doing?


I'll get Lola.
Okay.



I should go back there?

I would definitely.

It'd be good
to get up there again.

Hi. Sorry.
Hi, sweetheart.

Um, she's not backstage.

Well, she's...
She'll be somewhere.

Okay, I'll be back.
Sorry.

No worries.

Yeah, so I mean,
he did an incredible job for us.

[woman] It's probably not the best time.
[Bernard] No, no.

I mean, it's hard,
you know? Especially...

Sorry,
would you excuse me?

Lizzie! Hi.

Hi.
[Bernard] How are you?

Yeah, I'm good.

Good. So you...

you decided against the house?

Yeah. Yeah,
we ran the numbers

and just can't
swing the mortgage.

Right. Yeah.
I'm so disappointed.

I love it. I got carried away.
Oh.

I feel so embarrassed.

No, don't be embarrassed.
It's understandable.

You know, it's life.

Erm, we're actually having
a going away party,

if you were interested.

Oh, yeah. Thanks.
Saturday week.

It should go on till quite late. Should be fun.
Yeah.

Princess! Here she is!
[Lola giggling]

Oh, yes!
I'm so proud of you.


You were so good,
my love.

You were so great. So good.

[Lola] Really? I was so nervous.
Mmm.

[Bernard laughs]

Hi.

Hi. We meet again.

Is Thomas with you?

I've gotta go
and pick him up now.

Do you know someone here?

I just love ballet.
And you were amazing.

Did you see me
looking over at you?

Mm-hmm.

I've gotta go.
Sure.

[Lizzie] Bye.
See you.

That was odd.

Yeah. Yeah, it was.

You were so wonderful.

You were so good.

Is somebody starving?
[Lola] Yeah.

Starving to death?
[Lola giggles] Yeah.

[soft music playing]

Okay.

Wow, you have amazing skin.

Great.


Sure. Now?

Preferably, yes.

All right. Alice?

Mm-hmm.
Cover things for a few minutes?

You never intended
on buying the house.

I'm trying to work it out.

Work out what?

I lost my baby daughter
seven years ago.

I didn't know.
I'm... I'm sorry.

She died.

In a fire.

At Bryant Hospital.

Why are you telling me this?

Because every time I see Lola,
I'm more convinced.

Convinced of what?

[breathes shakily]

I'm pretty sure
she's my daughter.


That's crazy.

Hmm? You can't deny
that she looks like me.

You think
Lola is your daughter?

And what brings you
to that conclusion?

I just feel it.

I think you have a problem.

Something happened.

No. No, I don't
want to hear anymore.

This is nuts.
You know that, don't you?

At the hospital, in the
fire, in the confusion...

Look, I'm sure that whatever
happened to you was very painful,

but Lola is my daughter.

[exhales sharply] I can't
believe I just had to say that.

I don't know
about that hospital,

and I don't know
about any fire.

Okay? Lola was born
at Landry Maternity.

I'm very sorry for your loss,
but I can't help you.

I think
you need therapy.

I don't think our boys
should play together anymore.

And you need to stay away
from my family.


that proves anything.

Susan doesn't spread gossip.

She said it wasn't
just a little time off.

She said Lizzie was
committed for almost a year.

Yeah, but my love,
she lost a baby.

Imagine.

No, I can't imagine it.

I think we should
call the police.

Look, the point is,
there's no law against being crazy, okay?

People can say
whatever they wanna say.

I need you to hear me.
She is stalking our family.

Looking through our front gate

when we've got a "for sale" sign
up out there is not stalking.

Come on.
And, you know,

the other places,
the... the ice skating,

I mean,
you invited her to that.

And the ballet?
They're public places.

None of it
constitutes stalking.

The cops are not going to
do anything about it.

So we're just
supposed to do nothing?

No, we don't do nothing.
We just don't overreact.

I'm not overreacting.

You are.

We lock the doors.
We put the alarm on.

[children giggling]

Darling, it's okay.


[soft music playing]
[chattering]

You walked out
on a shift.

Best of luck
for your future endeavors.

Thanks.

Let's hope you're a better
parent than you are an employee.


You're hurting me.


Lizzie, come on.



What else can I do for you?

Uh, could you grab
some more buns, please?

Yeah, sure.
And some veggie burgers?

Okay, you got it.
Thank you.

[children chattering, laughing]


Hey, thanks for looking after the kids.
It's officially madness here.

[woman] <i>Okay then, no worries. We're coping.</i>
How are they doing?

Well, they are loading up on sugar.
You'll have fun tonight.

eat a burger or something, will you?</i>

[Ellen] <i>Yeah.</i>
Actually, are they handy? Can I say hi?

Uh, well, Jeremy's playing
soccer with his friends,

and Lola went for a walk
with your friend.

My friend?
[Ellen] <i>Yeah. The nice one. Lizzie.</i>

What?
<i>She was gonna buy your house.</i>

Wait, is that...
is that okay?

No.
Um, no, it's not okay.

She seems really nice.

<i>Listen, I'm coming, okay?</i>

Claire, I'm sure it's fine.

<i>Um, do you want me to...</i>

Yes. No. Uh... Fuck.

Look, uh,
I'll handle it, okay?

I can't believe you let her
go on a walk with her.

Do you wanna know a secret?

I had
a little girl once.

A little baby.

What happened to her?

She...

She was in an accident.

I loved her very much.


Do you love your mommy?

She loves you too.

Oh, shit.

Come on, fucking move!


[tires screeching]

Do you know what this is?

It's the mark of an angel.

When the baby
is in its mommy's womb...

it knows all the answers

to all the mysteries
in the whole world.

Then, just before it's born,

an angel places its finger
on the baby's mouth.

Shh.

And the child
forgets everything.

That's why we've all got
this little indent.

Yes.

That's it. [laughs]

All the answers
are in us.

But we have to be very quiet
and very still to remember them.

Do you remember me?

[breathing shakily]


[children clamoring]


Hi. Where is she?
Hey!

Uh, she's around here
somewhere.

Where?
She just came back.

Oh, there she is.

God, sorry.
You must think I'm mad.

Not at all, I'm so sorry.
She seemed really nice.

Hi.
Hi.

Are you good?
Uh-huh.

What have you been doing?

I went on a boat ride
with Lizzie.

Oh. Right.

Um...

What did...
What did you talk about?

Angels.

Angels. Okay.

Did you talk about
anything else?

Babies.

Babies.

Um...

Honey, did she...

Did she touch you at all?

No.

You sure?

Yeah? Okay.

And you talked about angels?
Yeah.

Right, well, that's nice.

I'm here.

I had to cover at work. Sorry.

Hello, Lizzie.

What are you doing here?
And what are you doing here?

The school called me.

You didn't pick me up
from soccer practice.

[Lizzie sighs]

Tommy, why don't you
go upstairs?

All right? Go on.

I'm so sorry, baby.

[door closes]
[ex-husband] Lizzie.

You know things have to change.

Thomas is at an age. He just...

It was a work emergency.

There's always
an excuse, Lizzie.

Mom?

Dad?

Come on!

You know things are better.

Lizzie, we all
care about you.

We want to support your healing process.
Oh, God.

We feel that your best chance
for full recovery

will come with the benefit
of another inpatient program.

It's only temporary.


I mean, I... I'm...

What about Thomas?
What about work?

Alice called.
She told us you lost your job.


She called you?
She fucking called you?

She said she'd sent you tons of messages.
What else could she have done?

I'm dealing with everything just fine.
It's just everyone else that...

Listen to yourself.
Everyone else?

You're just not there for him.

I wanna talk to him.
Wait.

When you came back...
from that hospital,

I don't think
you ever really came back.

That's not fair.

[exhales sharply] Okay.
Uh, look, I appreciate everyone's concern.

The truth is that I, um...

I've been focused on a...
situation that's come up.

It's actually kind of...
incredible.

I know this might sound crazy.
I know.

But I happened to meet
this little girl.

And I... I don't know
for sure yet.

There's a very strong
likelihood...

that it's Rosie.

Sweet love.
Yeah.

Yeah?

She's dead.

Our Rosie is dead.

No, you don't know that.

Please don't say that.

I'm trying to move on.

I've been trying,
but maybe there's a reason why I can't.

I can't explain it,
but I can feel it.

Mike, it could be her.

It could be our daughter.

Lizzie,
when will this end?

Well, if you hadn't
had her cremated back then,

it could have ended with an
autopsy, and we would have realized

that it wasn't our
daughter who was dead!

You think I had a choice?

You should have been there!

You should have been
with me that night!

You told me to go home
with Thomas!

Lizzie, just stop! Please.

Stop.

We have been over this
a thousand times.

Whatever it is
you're feeling...

I feel for you.

But you're not the only one
that went through this.

I did too.

But you're still stuck
back there.

Why do you think
I had to leave?

And now
Thomas is being affected.

How?

You make him
celebrate her birthday.

I'm not making him!

Please don't make me take
him away from you for good.

It's not what I want.

But I'm taking him
this week.

For now.

Are you two happy now?
Damn it, Lizzie.

You've gotta stop living with a ghost.
She's not coming back. Accept it!

She is still alive!
I can feel it! I'm her mother!

I'm her fucking mother! I would know!
Elisabet.

[speaking Swedish]

Elisabet.

You don't believe me.


Oh, Lizzie!

Lizzie!
Lena!

[music playing]
[chattering]

You looking for
the bathroom?

Uh, yeah. Yeah.

It's just through there.

Thanks.


What are you doing here?

Your husband invited me.

You need to leave my house.

I'll pay for a DNA test.
It's the only way.

Excuse me?

I know what I know.

God!

I want my daughter back.
Get out!

You're sick.
Do you understand that?

You need to leave my family
alone once and for all, okay?

We are now officially
in restraining order territory.

You need to get the fuck off my
property before I call the police.


You okay? Was that her?
Yeah, it was.

her and told her not to come.

[breathes deeply]
[Claire] I did call her.

[door closes]

[vehicle passing]

[man] Okay, here's our Uber!
[Claire] Bye, guys!

[woman] Thanks for the party!
[man] Great party.

[Bernard] Thanks for coming.
[Claire] See ya.

Come visit us in Perth.

[man] Yeah, we will.
[woman] Safe travels.

[man] Love you guys.
[woman] We'll miss you.

[doors closing]

[vehicle departing]

[dishes clattering]

[Claire] Pass the platters?
[Bernard] Sure. Just leave them. I'll get them.

I'm just gonna rinse them off.

Let's do the rest in the morning.

Can you lock the back?

Come to bed, my love!

[Claire] I'm just setting the alarm.
[beeps]





I am so, so sorry

that I didn't take you more seriously
about how crazy she is, okay?

And look, you were right.

I should have done something when
she took her out on the boat.

Tomorrow morning,
after I pick up the kids,

we're going to go to
the police station

and we will get
a restraining order, okay?


[birds chirping]

[snoring lightly]


[footsteps approaching]

get the kids, sweetheart.

Okay.

Anything you need?

No, just them.

[door closes]
[gasping]

[grunts]
[groans]

[grunting, groaning]



You broke into my home,
and you attacked me.

I could fucking end this right now.
Stab me.

Stab me!
Listen to me!

You are going to walk
out of my life right now.

No, I'm not. You have to kill
me 'cause I'm never gonna stop.

God!

I know what I know.

And what is that?

You have no idea
what it's like to lose a child.

To spend every day
missing a piece of yourself.

To live with a grief
that never goes away.

I... I lost my baby girl.

I lost my husband.

My marriage. My son
is being taken away from me.

I lost my job.

I can't even go on a date.

I can't laugh,
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

I used to be funny.
I used to be funny.

You're out of your mind.

That's what everyone's been saying...
for seven years.

But I...

I know what's mine.

No. Nothing is yours.

I'm gonna prove it.

I'm gonna hunt you down
and prove it.

You better get the fuck out of my house!
I'm never gonna stop.

Get out!
I'm gonna get that DNA

and your disgusting,
ugly secret is gonna come out,

and everyone is gonna know
what you really are.

Get out.

Get out.

You were there.
At the hospital.

Don't you fucking lie to me!
Don't lie to me!

I want the whole fucking world
to know what you are!

That you're a thief
and a fucking liar.

I'm not!
You stole my child.

You stole my baby.
[crying] No.

No, I saved her.
I saved her.


I saved her
because I lost my baby.

I lost my child to the fire.
She choked to death.

Oh, fuck!


I saw a dead woman on the floor.
I didn't see your face.

There were flames
and smoke everywhere.

I already had milk
in my breasts.

I lost my baby...

and another one
needed me.

I didn't even see it.
I heard it.

Her.

You heard her.

Her. Lola.

No. My Rosie.

I was alone
for the birth.

Bernie wasn't there.
I didn't have anyone.

He doesn't know Lola isn't his.
Please.

Please don't
take her from me.

Please.


Oh...

In the car, kids.
Okay. It's all right.

I'm s-sorry.

[door closes]


[door closes]


Is it true?

I'm so sorry.

It's her.
I found her.

Rosie.

[birds chirping]

Want some lemonade, Tom?
Yeah.

Um, so, how often is she
going to be staying with us?

Um, we don't know yet, babe.
We're still working it all out.

Maybe just a little bit
at first.


At least for now,
until Claire's trial is over.

But you're her mother.
She should live with you.

And Mike, too, of course.
Hmm.


You ready?

[Lizzie sighs]

Hi.

Hi.

Hi.

I'm so happy you're here.

Hello, Lola.

It's very lovely
to meet you.

I'm... I'm Mike.

Hi, Mike.

Hi.

Um... would you
like to come inside?

Yeah?

Um, I got an idea.

Would you like Jeremy to come
with you this first time?

Hmm?
Thomas is out the back.

Uh, yeah. That's...
That'd be fine.

Jez, do you wanna come and hang
with Thomas and Lola for a bit?

Yeah.
Okay, good boy.

Yeah.

This is Grandma.

Hello.
My name is Lena.

It's so lovely to meet you.
So lovely.

Hi, Lola.
[Lola] Hi.

I'm Carl,
your grandpa.
