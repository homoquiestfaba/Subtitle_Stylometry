[indistinct chatter]

[footsteps approaching]

excuse me.

Hi, do you do special orders?

Right.

Can you do a sketch
from this photo?

Come back in 15.

Actually, I was hoping
you could... I could just
pick it up tomorrow.

That way,
you can take your time,
make it extra special?

Extra special
costs extra dollars.

Okay, no problem.

-So what? Uh, 20?
-25.

Okay. 25.

Thank you.

I'ma need a deposit.

I'll give you
the rest tomorrow.

Okay.

Hey, Bev.

Something black and strong
to get you through the day.

Thank you, my good sis.

Mmm.


the place is coming together.

Right?
A far cry from my mom's
cluttered little thrift store.

Ugh, definitely.
I'm sure she'd love it.

Thank you.

-[man] get over here!
-[tanner] I... I'm coming.

-Oh, you know her.
-No.

Don't want to,
and neither do you.

She's a dope artist, Bev.

is dark and dreary.

That child did not get
enough hugs
as she was growing up.

Okay, okay.

Since you're here,
do you want
to help me unpack boxes?

Do I look like a stock girl?

No, you like the uppity ass,
overprice attorney
that you are!

-But...
-I'ma need a free meal
out of this.

-I got you.
-I don't mean pizza.

Okay. Okay.

and playing guitar]

[car engine starting]

[siren wailing in distance]

[indistinct chatter]

[children laughing]

wait for grandma,
babies, wait.

Slow down, babies.

some pancakes?

-Yeah!
-All right.
Elijah, you can say grace.

-Yay!
-[giggles]

[car horn honking]

[people shouting]

[Beverly laughs]

no pizza, huh?
That's three slices in now.

You know, I'm hungry, okay?

-You love this.
-You got me unpacking boxes.

-Look how great
this place looks.
-You did a great job.

Mmm-hmm.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

I'm trying everything.
Nothing's working
in this store, Bev.

I told you.

Don't put your house up
for collateral, don't go crazy
on renovations...

and I told you I wanted
to keep my mom's store open.

-Well, you make it a reprieve.
-Oh, yeah?

You know them deep-pocket
dudes that converted

Craig street mills into lofts?

Yeah, I know of them, yeah.

Well, they're buying
town edge mills.

Who told you that?

Pearl, she works
at the mayor's office,
remember?

Right. Pearl.

Speaking of things heating up.
Toni?

I think she's the one.

Bev!

-I do.
-Oh, I'm so happy for you!

-Now we just gotta
find the one for you now.
-Ah, no.

Come on, I've sworn off
relationships, remember?

Ah, come on.
Don't let whatever happened
with that bastard ex...

what happened was
I chose the wrong man.
Just like my mom did.

I'm not making
that same mistake again.

And I don't wanna
talk about it.

-You've come so far.
-[sighs]

you deserve a good man.

The only man I'm looking for
is one whose face is plastered
on a $100 bill.

-Okay?
-[laughing]

ah, I need to make some money
and move some product.

Speaking of which...

Do you wanna mind
the front counter

while I organize
a shipment tomorrow?

You know I got
a whole law degree, right?

Yes, and you know what?
You can do it
on your lunch break.

My treat.

-Girl, I don't want
any dry-ass pizza.
-Okay.

-Okay, okay, give me, give me.
-Okay, yes,
that's what I thought.

Uh-huh. [laughs]

[car horn honking]

-hey.
-[cashier] how you doing?
Can I take your order?

Yeah, can I get a iced latte?

Ah, light on the ice,
five pumps vanilla syrup,
splash of oat milk,

three shots of espresso
and a dash of cinnamon.

-Right.
-Thanks.

Large dark roast,
three sugars.
Thank you.


I'm sorry, uh, iris?

Clay. More house college?

Clay... Washington?

oh, my god.

-It's been years.
-Yeah, uh, I didn't expect
to see you here.

I thought you,
uh, got engaged.

I did, I did. I... yeah.


-Um.
-Uh, this is home for you.

It is. Yeah, I actually
just moved back.

I have a house up the street
and I work as a nurse
at, uh, st. Andrews.

That's great.

I just run the little
gift shop up the street.

-Oh, uh, that's real cute.
-[laughs]


-Oh.
-Oh! Uh, sorry.

No, don't worry. I got you.
Yeah.

Here you go, boss.

Thank you.

And for the lady.

-Okay, maybe I'll,
uh, see you around?
-Mmm-hmm.

Yeah, okay.

-[iris] stay dry, yeah.
-[laughs] okay.

Wow.

<i> â™ª oh, please</i>
<i> oh, please, just stay â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª yeah â™ª</i>

[engine revving]

[tanner sighs]

Tanner Faris.
I thought I'd find you here.

Still doing
your little drawings, huh?

How's my little
ghetto Rembrandt?

Long time no see.

Not long enough.

Petey fronted you some cash.
I'm here to collect.

What's wrong with petey?

He can't collect
his own money, hmm?

The funny thing about it,
tan tan, is it wasn't
Petey's money.

-It was my money.
-So petey your front man now.

Well, yeah.
I mean, he was, but

he's no longer in my employ.

[baker inhales]

I'll make you a proposition.
Either you pay me,

or you work for me.

You know I don't do business
with you, baker.

Oh, yes, that's right.
You were always too good

-for us foster home brats,
huh?
-Don't even try.

Me and Elijah
always had your back

-and then you started wilin'.
-How is baby bro?

I hear he's doing all right
for himself.

I'm really glad the system
worked for somebody, at least.

What you know about Elijah?

Don't worry about that.
Either you get me my money
or I'll hit up Eli.

Stay away from my brother.

Ooh!
Still the protective
big sister, huh?

Sit your ass back down.

That's right.
Now you're gonna do
the usual business.

Run some credit cards,
swap some play money.

You know how I do, right?

This community
is on its last leg

and you are still out here
running credit card scams?

You're not really
in the position to be choosey

about the kind of work
you do, tan.

You got a week.

-[yelps]
-[baker] one week.

[engine starting up]


One week, tan tan.

[tires screech]


it's amazing.

You had me nervous at first.
Just staring at it like that.

No. No, no.
It's really beautiful.

-So, uh, we good?
-Yes, yes.

Actually,
that's your painting, right?

Yeah.

Would you mind making this
a painting instead?

Something, just more vibrant.

I'll pay you extra.

I mean, I can... But, um,

you know,
it'd take a minute, though.

That's fine. No rush at all.

My mom just loved
this picture so much.

She passed away
six months ago, so.

Just give me a week.

Yes, yes. Thank you.

And don't forget
to sign it this time.

An artist
should always sign her work.

Thank you.

Come on!

[engine starts]

[bell dings]


[line ringing]

oh, no, no, no, you ain't.

-No, no, no, no...
-no, no, please, please!

-No, no, what the hell
are you doing?
-Please! Come on now.

-Nothing. Come on, please!
-That's a whole lot of nothing
in your bag.

Come on.
I'll just put it back.

-Yes, hi, I'd like
to report a theft.
-Come on.

-I wasn't even doing nothing!
-Opal's, McNair street.

Come on, I'll put it back.

-Thank you.
-Don't do this, please!

-[siren wailing]
-what's going on?

What? What happened?

I caught your little
dope artist helping herself
to your merchandise.

That's... Beverly!
Bev, what are you doing?

I warned you about this chick.

[police radio chatter]

I didn't know
it was your store.

stealing is stealing!

And you taking from another
black woman.

-You know, this is why
we can't get ahead...
-shut up!

Okay, stop, stop!
Beverly did you call
the cops on this girl?

Officer, I walked in
from the back

and I caught
this woman stealing.

Well?

-Come with me.
-[tanner scoffs]

come on, man.

You have the right
to remain silent.

-Anything you say can
and will be...
-[tanner] come on, stop.

-That's too hard.
-You have the right
to an attorney.

[iris shouting] mama, mama!

Calm down! Calm down!

Stop it you're hurting me!

-[siren wailing]
-mom!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Let me go!
Mom! Mom!


I'll pay you back, okay?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

[car door closing]

[siren wailing]

[tanner sighs]


<i> you living like this, Elijah.</i>

<i> go back, I'm never talking</i>
<i> to you again.</i>

<i> â™ª amazing grace â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª how sweet the sound â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª that saved a wretch â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª like me â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª I once was lost â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª but now I'm found â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª was blind â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª but now I see â™ª</i>

what does that mean, grandma?

God's grace?
It's all about his love
for his children.

It's his mercy,
it's his forgiveness.

His grace is sufficient,
no matter who you are,
no matter what you've done.

Ah, even
when we don't deserve it,
he gives it freely.

And you know what?
He wants us to do the same
for each other.

Remember that, okay?

Grandma Maeble, I thought
grace was something you do
before you eat.


-Y'all want some pancake?
-Yeah!

-All right.
-[cell opening]


-What'd I do?
-[officer] come with me.

[indistinct chatter]

-yes.
-[door buzzing]

what's going on?

Excuse me, what are you doing?

What does it look like?
I'm getting you out of jail.

What?

Let's go.

[door buzzing]

uh... You wanna tell me
what I'm doing here?

You work here.
For now, anyway.

Excuse me?

My friend and I convinced
the d.A. To drop the charges,

but I had to pay
a $1,000 fine,
so you have to pay me back.

Please, tell me
this ain't the same friend
that had me arrested

in the first place.

At $15 an hour,
eight hours a day,
six days a week,

you'll pay me back
in approximately
eight and a half days.

Are you serious?

Anything you earn above
and beyond that,
will be given to you in cash.

Look, look.
I don't know
what you think this is,

but you cannot
control my life,

just because
you bailed me out of jail.

You know what?
I do what I want when I want.

And I don't answer to nobody.

You'll be answering to a judge
if you go back to jail.

Why you doing this?

Because you looked scared
when they arrested you.

So.

So?

So I wanted
to give you a break.

Well, you could have
given me a break
before you had me arrested.

Get to work.

-Fine.
-Fine.

this box off.

Do you need a ride anywhere?

-[tanner] nah, I'm good.
-Okay.

-[iris] I'll see you tomorrow?
-Yep.

[engine revving]

[siren chirps in distance]

I told them, just give me
a little more time.

[distant car honks]

well, uh, thanks again
for all the hard work.

Yeah, thanks.

Oh, um, you worked
a little extra, so.

No worries. I'll be done
with your painting
in a couple of days.

Yeah, okay.

-Hey, you like gumbo?
-Yeah.

-You should come over.
-Okay.

I told you. [laughs]
my momma's gumbo
is the truth, okay.

-Yeah, I...
I needed that. [chuckles]
-right?

Yeah, that recipe's been
in my family for generations.

-They're creole, so you know
it's the real deal.
-[tanner] mmm-hmm.

So you, uh, you keep in touch
with your fam?

On and off, yeah.
What about you?

You said you don't have
any family around here, right?

So it's just you?

Um... Just me and my,
uh, little brother, Elijah.

Oh, nice. And where is he?

Not sure.

Um... Moved out of state
when he got adopted.

After that, he kind of fell
off the face of the earth.

And last time
I tracked him down,
he was in California.

And he didn't want nothing
to do with me. [scoffs]

he even blocked me
on social media.

Why? What happened
between you two?

Well, when my grandma died,
we ended up in foster care.

I aged out and he got adopted.

And he wanted to stay with me,
but I couldn't
take care of him, so.

So pissed at me that he, uh,
he promised he'd never
talk to me again.

And he kept his word.

So, you just left it at that?

You never tried
to contact him?

-I never stopped trying
to contact him.
-Okay.

Even if I found him,
I don't think he'd talk to me.

Can't stay mad at you forever.


if you want help
looking for him,

-I will help you if you want...
-no, no.

-No, I appreciate it.
-Okay.

But, um...

I think he's better off
without me.

Okay.

[bell ringing]

-hello, hello.
-Hi.

-What's up?
-Hi, what are you doing here?

Oh! Don't tell me.

Large iced latte,
vanilla syrup. Oh, milk.

-Okay?
-A tree, the forest.

[both laughing]

-for you.
-Thank you.

-This is perfect.
-Mmm-hmm.


Cool store you got.

Take a look around, please.
You might find
something you like.

Mmm-hmm. [chuckles]

I'm also setting up
an online store,

so if you don't like
the in-person
shopping experience.

Oh, no, I'm all about
the in-person
shopping experience.

Yeah.

Yeah, yes. Me too.

You know, there's nothing like
picking things up

and... Touching them
before you buy.

I couldn't agree more.

This is beautiful.
Stunning, really. Yeah.

Uh, now this is cool.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
I'll just, uh...

This was my mom's.

Yeah, she used to play records
in here all the time.

I don't know if it fits
any more though.

Are you kidding?
Throw some lps on that.
That's instant vibes. What?

Okay, Clay, um, sorry.

Everyone plays their music
off of this now.

But I still love the sound
of a needle touching vinyl.

Clay, lattes, vinyl,
beaded bracelets.

You literally went from
penny loafers and button-downs
to full-on hipster mode.

Well, you haven't
changed much.

Oh, yeah?

Still stylish, still smart.

[chuckles softly]

still gorgeous as ever.

I really missed out, huh?

[bells chiming]

saved by the bell.
Um, I'ma cut out.

-Uh, I'll catch you later?
-Okay.


uh, well thank you again
for the coffee.

It's really nice of you.

Don't get rid of that
record player.

Might have a little surprise
for you later.

Okay.

Okay, yes. This is beautiful.

-[tanner] are you guys hiring?
-[woman] no.

Okay. Thank you.

-Thank you.
-Okay.

Hey, uh, excuse me.

-Y'all hiring?
-Uh, nope.

-Full-time?
Part-time? Anything?
-Nah.

Metro crossroads development.
You're rolling with some
big ballers now, huh?

You know, did I ever give you
any indication that I wanted
to sell my store?

You have given me
every indication
that you're struggling.

I know, but.

Where is this key?

Okay, I'm not telling you
to sell or not to sell.

Just think about it.
That's all.

Thank you for freedom
of choice.
That's so nice of you.

You come
to the store everyday.

You see what
I'm trying to do...

you complain to me
all the time.

I'm just trying to help
a sister out. That's all.

I'm not complaining.
You and your friend think

you can just do
whatever you want.

And it's... It's annoying.

It's annoying.
Let's start there.

Where is this...
Where is this Allen key?

Oh, my goodness.

You looking for this?

-No.
-You sure?

Yeah, thank... Okay.

-Hmm. Bye.
-Have a great day!

It was so good to see you!

[bell ringing]

we're done.

[upbeat hip-hop music playing]

[indistinct conversations]

what's going on?

No call, no text?
No love note?

Can't you see I'm trying
to figure it out, baker?

-Just... I need
more time, all right?
-I gave you time.

Here's what we're going to do.

Take this to your new
place of employment.

Don't look surprised.
I know about your little
gift shop gig.

-I don't work there
no more, okay?
-Not my problem.

Run these cards,
swap this cash,

bring me my money
and your slate is clean.

It's that easy.

The store ain't making
money like that.

Also not my problem.

What happened to you,
baker, huh?

We always said that
we would never
let the system break us.

There's other ways
and you know that.

Isn't that sweet?

Maybe I should call Eli
and see if he feels
the same way.

Leave him out of this, please.
This is between me and you.

Well, Eli seems to be
the only thing
that motivates you.

So know that I could
take him out and not even
break a sweat.

-Get out of here.
-That's right.

See you soon.

[clears throat]

hi.

-Hey.
-Hi.

Come in, yeah.

I was, uh, wondering.

You haven't had any
strange people hanging
around here, have you?

No. No, not that I've noticed.

I was just asking because,
you know, we be having

some shady characters
around here sometimes.

This coming from
the woman who stole
from your store, right?

Tanner, I appreciate
your concern but, no.

Well, you should think about
getting an alarm system.

Just to be safe.

Okay, someone's a little
on edge today.

But I got you...

I got you on the alert.
It's already set up.

-That's good.
-Mmm-hmm.

Well, I've almost
finished your painting.

Sorry it's taking me so long.

It's fine.

-Tanner.
-Hmm?

-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

Well, let me buy you lunch.
We can chat.

-Yeah.
-Okay.


-oh, this looks good.
-Yeah, it's the best
in the city.

-Oh, yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

Is that how you eat tacos?

I just thought
there would be a plate.

I thought we'd
be sitting down...

-we're outside, iris.
-Yeah, I know.

Oh, my goodness.

-[chuckles]
-can I ask you a question?

A personal question.

Hmm, depends how personal.

How do you get by
here, tanner?

How do most of the people
here get by here

now that the plants
have closed,
the factories have closed?

Just like you, I guess.
A lot of hard work
and a lot of faith, you know.

It's kind of hard
to have faith when
you're staying in a shelter.

I saw you in line
the other night.

-You don't have any place
else you can stay?
-Like where, iris?

I don't know.
Family or friends or...

no, I don't have none.

And cheap housing
is hard to come by.

-White people coming in here
and driving up the prices.
-It's not just white people.

And look, there are advantages
to companies coming into
communities like this

and investing and building...

investing is one thing.

Erasing,
that's a whole nother thing.

You know, developers
when they come here,

all they see
is buildings and houses.

But this...

This is life. This is me.
This is all I know.

Can't you see that?
It's beautiful.

And I agree with all of that,
but that's not all you need.

What about the people
who are out of work

living on the street,
in shelters?

-Those are
circumstances, iris.
-I know.

People are more
than their circumstances.

-Of course, I know that.
-You know...

-Tanner...
-are you good?

I did not mean to offend you.
I'm just...

nah, nah.
'cause you don't understand.

You just like everybody else.

I thought you were different.
I really did.

Nah, you're good.
I got to go.

I'll see you around,
all right?


hi, I was wondering
if I could talk to someone

about getting an extension
on my mortgage payments.

Yeah, you know,
if she could call me back,
that would be great.

555-0100. Yeah, that's it.
Okay, thank you.

I'm back.

-You are back. Yeah, you...
-I'm back.

-Of course.
-[chuckles]

-and remember I said I might
have a surprise for you?
-Yes, I do.

<i> Viola.</i>

I recall from our one date
that was technically
not a date,

-you were a hip-hop head.
-Yeah?

-So.
-And r&b.

Oh, wow.

-[Clay stutters] uh... okay.
-Oh, wow, vanilla ice.

-Oh, my god. I've been waiting
for this album.
-All right, wait. No.

-You are amazing.
-That one is my brother's.

I was always more bebop
than hip-hop.

Okay.

This one is from
my collection.

-Jazz.
-Yeah.

-Nice.
-Why don't you take it
for a spin?

-Go ahead.
-Yeah?

-[iris gasps] oh!
-Ooh! You okay?

-No, no. It's fine. It's fine.
Yeah, I'm fine.
-Okay, no.

-No, it's really not
that serious.
-Iris, please sit.

-Okay.
-Careful.

Sit back. Get your feet up.

[romantic music playing]

-[gasps] oh!
-What about this?

-Hmm? Um...
-Does that hurt?

No... no.

What about right there?

That feels, that feels...

-It's good.
-[chuckles]

-[exhales]
-so it looks like it's just
a twisted ankle, then.


Yeah, are you okay?

Hey!

-Bev!
-[Beverly] uh...

-Should we come back later?
-No, it's fine. No.

-Are we
interrupting something?
-No, it's fine.

Welcome to opal's.

Alton miller,
this is iris Duchamp.
She owns opal's.

Ah, nice to meet you.

-Lovely place.
-Thank you. Thank you so much.

Clay... Clay, this is...
This is my good friend,
uh, Beverly Corson.

Oh, Clay. Mmm, okay.
The morehouse man.
I see you.

-So you were talking about me?
-No, no! Oh, no!

-Why are you here?
-I'm in a group chat already?

-Yes. Well, this was fun.
-I need to talk to you.

I'm going to go.
Just make sure to rest
the ankle, okay?

Yes, thank you so much.
Thank you.

-Bye, Clay.
-Beverly.

-Okay. Mmm-hmm.
-What do you want?

Walk with me.

-[laughs] your ankle looked
fine to me.
-Don't... Oh, shut up!

Uh, okay, so, what...
what is this about?

-So, I work for
crossroads metro development.
-Right.

-Why am I here?
-The response has been
so overwhelming.

We're looking to buy
some of the buildings
on this block.

What will happen
to the businesses
that are already here?

Uh, we'll refurbish the stores
and business owners
can rent from us.

I'm pretty sure they won't
be able to afford your rent.

Oh, so, but you're counting
on that, right?

-[Alton] iris, listen.
-Is he... Why am I here?

Most of the businesses
are months behind
on their rent.

Their debt would be forgiven.

And, if they choose
to move on,

other businesses can
come in and...

and breathe life
back into this community.

I know you own your building.

Yes, I do.

But I also know
that your business
has been struggling.

So, crossroads metro
development would like
to buy your store.

No stress.

[rain pattering]

[thunder rumbling]


[sighs wearily]


[man shouting] opal!

-Mom!
-I know, I know.

open the damn door!


don't look, don't look.

[pounding at door]

opal, you hear me!

-Where are you? I'm going to
find you, bitch.
-He's gonna hurt you.

[man yelling] you hear me?

I will find you!

[iris gasps]


[sighs wearily]

[somber instrumental
music playing]

tanner.

Tanner!

Tanner!

What?

Tanner.

-Iris.
-Tanner.

I didn't mean what I said.
Okay?

You were right.
These are circumstances.

Okay? Come work
in the store with me.

You drove all the way
in the rain
just to tell me that?

Yes, I did.

-I'm worried about you,
tanner.
-I'm good.

No! Tanner, wait!

You're not okay.
Let me help you.

You've helped plenty.

Is it really that hard for you
to accept a hand from someone?

I'm literally trying
to help you.

You know what?
I'm not gonna beg you.

-Do what you wanna do.
-Okay.

[thunder rumbling]

iris, wait!

What?

I'm all... my stuff's all wet.

I know, come on.

[sighing in exhaustion]
thank you.

You can use the office,
slash guest room,
slash whatever room.

All right.

Sorry, I wasn't
expecting company. Sorry.

Come in.


So, uh...

Sorry.

Most of your neighbors white?

No, not really.

Some, some of them...

Yeah. Yeah, most of them.


I'm gonna get you some bedding
and some dry clothes.

Just give me one second.


-You graduated from spelman?
-Mmm-hmm.

It says here that you're
the buyer of the month.

What did you buy?

Mostly specialty items.

Art, decor.

I worked for Chartoff, so.

Well, why'd you leave?

Well, my mom, she struggled
with the store.

When she died, I felt bad.

Like, I could've done more
to help her, you know.

But I was just caught up
with my own drama.

I guess, me coming back here
is my way of
making it up to her.

Plus, I needed a change
of scenery

and Moses park felt like
a good place to heal.

[tanner laughs]

well, this isn't exactly
Moses park.

This is Lincoln.

Moses park's uppity cousin.

[iris laughs] okay.

Uh...

-Can I ask you a question?
-Mmm-hmm.

I mean...

How do you deal
with the guilt?

Over not being there
for your mom.

Is that why you help people?

I help people because
that's how my mama raised me.

[sighs softly]

speaking of my mom...

You can't finish a painting
without paint.

You should've just told me
you didn't have the supplies.

[tanner exhales]

it's okay.

Get some sleep. It's okay.

-Hey, iris.
-Mmm-hmm?

Thanks.

You know.

Goodnight.

[soft piano music playing]

what you so mad about?

'cause you ran away, Elijah.

I'm not gonna
let them people adopt me.

I wanna stay with you.

Oh, right, so we both can be
living off of ramen noodles
and juice boxes?

Nah, not no more.

Where'd you get
that money from?

I've been runnin' errands
with baker.

He's been teaching me
all kinds of stuff.

I told you I don't want
you foolin' with baker.

Man, baker's not gonna
let anything happen to me.

You need to be focused
on graduating from high school
and going to college.

Look who's talkin'.

I'm callin'
the Hendersons, okay?

-Why you trippin'?
-[screams] because I can't
take care of you, Elijah!

I don't want you livin'
like this.

If you make me
go back, tanner,

I'm never talkin'
to you again.



-[line ringing]
-[Mrs. Henderson]
<i> Henderson's residence.</i>

<i> Tanner, is that you?</i>

<i> If Elijah is there,</i>
<i> we can come pick him up.</i>

Yeah, he's here.

<i> Tanner, we promise</i>
<i> to take good care of him.</i>

[dramatic music playing]

[humming "amazing grace"]

hey.

-Good morning.
-I'ma head out.

Oh, I can...
I can just drop you off
wherever you need to go.

Or you can just come join us
for brunch. Come, yes.

-Come to brunch.
-No brunch.

-I can cook.
-Oh, no.

I can cook.

You can cook, but you're not
going to find anything
in my kitchen.

-Watch me, okay, trust me.
-No, I'm tellin' you.

Oh, pancake mix.
Oh, that's good.

Eggs, yes.

-Yeah.
-Oh, good.

You obviously know
what you're doing.

-You've got plenty.
-[doorbell rings]

smell it, though.

-One second.
-Okay.

-[gasps]
-surprise!

Happy mimosa Sunday!

[both laugh]

pearl and I, we had
a last-minute change of plans.

Something about family drama.

So, it's just you, me,
a pitcher of mimosas...

and the thief
who robbed your store?

Iris, what the hell?

-Tanner, meet Beverly.
-Yes.

The one who got the d.A.
To release you.

Well, you wouldn't have had
to release me

if you wouldn't have had me
arrested in the first place.

Well, you wouldn't have been
arrested if you hadn't have
been a thief.

Is it your store? You need
to mind your business.

Get your girl.

That's what you need to do.
Get your girl.

You know what? I'm not even
gonna stoop to your level.

You know where your level is?

right down there, okay?

-You know, I can't...
-okay, Beverly,
just one second...

-she is...
-one second...

-what is she doing here?
-Beverly, be quiet.
Just stop...

did she really
just try to come for me?

She's a little upset.
You got her arrested.

-She's upset?
-Yes.

-She? She is upset?
-Yes...

I. I'm upset. Okay?

-You know it's bad enough
that you guilt me...
-I didn't guilt you.

...Into getting her
out of jail.

Now, you two are having
slumber parties.

I found her in an alleyway
trying to find cover
from the rain.

What was I supposed to do?
What would you have done?

Send her to a hotel.

Anything would've been
better than inviting
a stranger into your home,

iris.

Bev, it's all good. I got it.

-Okay? [exhales]
-okay.

Are we having mimosas or not?

I'm keepin' my eye on her.

Cheers.

-Cheers.
-Cheers.

Happy Sunday.

Too much orange juice.

Thanks for everything, iris.

I know I can be a little...
I appreciate everything.

Anytime you need
a place to stay.

I got you. Okay?

-You hangin' out or...
-[cell phone ringing]

-uh, no, I think I'm gonna
go to my spot.
-Oh.

I'll let you get that.

I'm gonna get some coffee.

-What?
-[baker on phone]<i> tanner.</i>

<i> I'm tired of waiting for you</i>
<i> to get your act together.</i>

-<i> Don't test me.</i>
<i> -Look,</i> I can't do this
right now, baker.

-I can't.
<i> -You serious?</i>

<i> You owe me money.</i>
<i> I'm comin' to collect.</i>

-I ain't got it right now.
Seriously. I need more time.
<i> -Oh, you think I'm playing?</i>

<i> I checked Eli already.</i>
<i> And, now, I'm going to check</i>
<i> your girl's store.</i>

[baker hangs up]

baker.

Iris, um, you know,
I think I might, uh,
help you out today.

If that's okay?

-Yeah.
-Yeah?

-Okay.
-Okay.

-All right, let's go.
-All right.

Come on.

You brought so much life
in here with
these plants, tanner.

You really did a great job.

Just too bad it's still
not enough.

I really don't want to sell to
these crossroads guys, but...

I've leveraged
everything I can
to keep these doors open.

And I am practically
tapped out on my savings.

Maybe you could turn
things around.

Tanner, I've tried everything.

-I'm telling you...
-except a makeover.


Oh, you're serious.

Yeah, I mean,
you could revamp
this whole spot.

You know, like...

Please.

-I mean...
-Please, I'm listening.

This is the first display
people see when
they walk in the door.

-Right.
-Liven it up a bit.
Add some flavor to it.

Some color.

Spice it up.

Okay, what else do you got?

-Mmm-hmm. Go ahead.
-Okay, well, I just feel like

this store needs to feel
more like Moses park.

Right.

-Artsy, earthy, colorful.
-Okay. Yes, yes.

You know,
give it a little
Harlem renaissance vibe?

You know, those artists
painted about real shit.

-Just like the artists
of Moses park.
-Yes, yes, yes.

You know, some culture?

Okay, so, what if you
and your friends

sold your paintings
in the store on consignment.

Right?

-Okay.
-I could convert
the back area into a studio.

So, you could paint in here
anytime you want.

You don't have to paint
on the street anymore.

And the jewelry vendors
could...

they could set up here, too.

-Yeah.
-And I could change
the name of the store.

Opal's artist market.

-That's dope.
-Yeah? Right?

Okay. And I can hire you
as a consultant
because you're a genius.

-Can you though?
-Look.

You need a place
to stay, right?

I need help that
I clearly can't afford.

-I don't know.
-It's the barter system.

-Okay.
-Okay?

-Yes.
-Okay.

Okay. All right.

Hi. Welcome to
opal's artist market.

Thank you.

I got this.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

Okay.

Nice store.

$4.75.

I'm not takin'
your fake money, baker.

-Real nice store.
-Thank you so much, thank you.

Do it.

-You're gonna clear her out.
-Hurry up.

I'll be back.

-Take care now.
-Oh, thank you so much
for coming.

-Thanks for having me.
-Yeah.

You know what I'm thinking?

We should probably do
some stuff

to promote all the new changes
in the store, right?

Mmm-hmm.

Okay, so, we should probably
post something
on social media.

And I could probably get
some flyers printed out, too,
to hand out later.

-I could do that.
-Yeah?

-Mmm-hmm.
-Okay.

Good.

-[iris] opal's artist market.
-[tanner] hey.

We're just down the street.
Opal's artist market.

Please come by this weekend.

Hey, here you go.

-Opal's artist market.
-Yup, just down the street.

[upbeat music playing]

you can put that right there.


Hey, what's all this?

A vendor I know is getting rid
of supplies.

So, I was thinking...

Everybody around here
does murals.

Why not tanner faris?

Grandma always wanted me
to do one of those.

Whenever you're ready.

Thank you.


with this?

I made this. I did.

Do you want me
to wrap it for you?

Okay. Thank you.

Thank you so much.

Thank you.

Thank you for coming.

Hey. Business is booming.

Hi. Yeah. Yeah,
things are picking up.

I can see that.
That might mean
you need a little break.

Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

Well, I'm having
a little housewarming
barbeque tonight.

Why don't you stop by?

-Well...
-[laughs]

I mean, you can bring
a friend if you want.

Sounds like fun.

Oh, it will be.

Especially if you're there.

All right. So, tonight?

-Okay.
-Cool.

He was cute.

All right, he wanna take
you out to a party?

Yeah. Well,
he wants to take us
out to a party.

Girl, no. I'm not going.

Yes. Yes, we are. Yes.

All of the bracelets are $10,
handmade by a local artisan.

Girl, I ain't going
to no party.
I ain't got nothing to wear.

Oh. Oh, I got you.

Yes. We are going
to a party, okay.
You're coming.

â™ª<i> tonight it's goin' down</i>
<i> you're steppin' outâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> girl, y'all lookin' good</i>
<i> can't wait to see you</i>

girl, you look hot as hell.
Girl, come here. Yes.

Oh, man.

Oh, man.

-Oh, wow.
-Yes.

Oh.

Look at you.

Wait until
Clay sees you, girl.

-Stop.
-I mean...

Look at those shoes.

Look at your shoes.

Look at that.

we are gonna have fun tonight.

Okay. What about hair?

-What's wrong with my hair?
-I can do braids. Okay?

Yeah?

-Hell, yeah.
-Yes. Okay.

-Okay.
-Okay. Okay.

-Just get the combs.
-All right.

-All right.
-Okay.

-You're gonna sit right here.
-Okay.

You look beautiful.

[grandma Maeble humming
"amazing grace"]

-ow.
-[Maeble] grandma's sorry,
baby.

But, this is too much hair
on this head.

Hold still, tanner,
hold still.

[Maeble humming]

I don't think I'll ever forget
this song, grandma.

I don't think
I'll forget this song, too,
grandma Maeble.

Oh, that's good, baby.
That's real good.

[continues humming
"amazing grace"]

what?

I haven't had anybody
do my hair since I was
a little girl.

Well,

I am about to hook you up.

["south so dirty" playing]

â™ª<i> journey out</i>

Am I overdressed?

-No, no, no. You good.
-No? Okay.

You good.

-Great.
-Ooh, there go Clay.

-[tanner] right there.
-He's looking over here.


-[tanner] here he comes.
-He's coming.

-Yup.
-He's coming.

-You look good.
-You look great.

Hey, ladies.

Wow.

Hi.

Thanks for coming.
Got you some drinks.

Thank you.

Nah, I'm good. I'm gonna
get into that spades game
over there.

I'll catch you all later.

Okay.

It's beautiful.

It's really, really beautiful.

You haven't seen
everything yet.

Okay.

And...

<i> Voila.</i>

Oh, my goodness.

It's so beautiful, Clay.

-Cozy, right?
-Oh, my goodness. Yes.

[party music continues]


Uh, who next?

For real, for four?

-Seen it. Seen it.
-Uh, yeah... I see that!

Blaow!

look what we got there!

Forget you!

-In all honesty...
-Hmm?

...It came with the house.

Well, I'm glad you kept it.

Me too.

How much do you remember
about our first date,
which wasn't actually a date?

Well, um, let's see.
I remember talking
about biology

-and we talked a lot
about physics.
-Right.

-Jazz.
-Yeah.

-Right?
-And then, um,

-that's when you spilled
red wine all over me.
-Mmm-hmm.

-Right. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

Yeah. I, uh...

That's right. I did do that.

-You did do that.
-Yeah.

-Hmm.
-I felt horrible.

Your friends were
laughing at you.

You had a huge spill
on your pants the whole night.

But, you didn't laugh at me.

In fact, you were
very apologetic.

-Was I?
-Mmm-hmm.

-Hmm.
-Even after I turned you down
for a date?

First time, second time.

Three times, actually.
Three, yeah.

-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah.

-I guess... it took me a minute
to really understand. Yeah.
-Oh, right. Yeah.

Well, here we are now.

You have
a beautiful new house
and a great career.

You don't have
anyone in your life.

Uh...

I have my eye on someone.


["do yo dirty dance"

[cell phone ringing]

what's wrong?

My alarm.

I think someone's trying
to break into my store.

Okay, uh, I'll come with you.

-Iris...
-Don't... don't touch me.

-[tanner] what's wrong?
-I'm sorry.

Someone's trying
to break into my store.

Okay. Come on.

I'm really sorry.


-Tanner, keys.
-Call the police, iris.

Look at this, tanner.

I can't catch a break.

a break.

It's okay.

I'll make you some tea.

Yeah?

-[whispers] okay.
-Okay.

Thank you.

[teapot whistles]


[alarm ringing]

oh.

Coffee. Coffee.

[iris whispers] coffee.
Coffee.

[groans softly]


Morning.

Thank you.

You okay?

Well, someone broke
into my store last night.

And there was
too much wine.

Too much of whatever
that fruity drink was.

But, Clay was all right.

Yeah. Yeah, he was. Yeah.

Well, what... What happened
between you two last night?

It wasn't him.

I...

He grabbed my arm
and I overreacted. So.

My ex-fiance was abusive.


So was my mom's boyfriend.

Sometimes, I just get
a little bit triggered.

You should call him.

You should grab
the extra set of keys
in my purse

and open up the store
for me this morning.

Please.

If you don't mind.
Let me just
get myself together.

-I got you.
-[excitedly] yeah?

-Yeah.
-Okay. Thank you.

-Okay.
-Yeah.



Call him.

Okay, tanner.

Listen, your ex was
an asshole, but...

That's still no reason
you should keep
punishing yourself.

Okay.

What about you?

What about me?

You keep beating yourself up
over Elijah.

Maybe it's time we both
just be a little bit kinder
to ourselves.

-Mmm-hmm.
-Okay.

See you later.

Mmm-hmm. All right.

Oh.

Where are you going
without these?

I don't want these boots

stinking up your house,
anyway.

I'll clean up the shop, okay?


[iris groans]

all right. This is awesome.

Thank you so much for coming.

Thank you.


[ominous music playing]

tanner, what are you doing?

I was just...

I can explain.

I can explain.

Are you going to explain to me
why you're stealing from me...

Again?

Iris, it's not like that.

Look, I don't wanna
make a scene.

Then leave. Leave.

Give me my money
and get out of my store.

I will not keep doing this
with you, tanner.

So, you don't even want
to hear what I have to say?

No.

[tanner sighs]

I can't believe
you did that to me.

You take your money
and you take you punk...

what the hell do you
think you're doing?

You think you can
just come here
and throw shit at me?

No. I know it was you
who broke into iris' store.

Oh, yeah. Okay. So, you're
an upstanding citizen, huh?

-No, no, no.
-You're gonna turn me in?

No. No.

'cause, I learned about grace.

And now I'ma have
to teach you,
because no matter what,

we're family, baker.

Now, look, I'm going
to pay you your money
when I can.

But, in the meantime,

you owe my friend $100.

And it's time you pay up.

Right now.

It's legit.

Yo, tanner.

You know I would never
hurt Eli, don't you?

Or you.

No, baker,

I don't know that.

Yo, pick this shit up.
I shouldn't have to ask.


[phone notification chimes]

you sure you wanna do this,
iris?

What else can I do?
I'm in debt
up to my eyeballs,

people are stealing
from me, Bev.

I hate to say
I told you so, but...

-I told you.
-I know.

I'm doing all of this to save
a store that, literally,
nobody else cares about.

So, yeah. I'm sure.

-Okay.
-Make the call.

[line ringing]

Alton, Beverly Corson here.

Iris and I would like
to see you in the morning
to discuss your offer.

Great. See you then.

-Done and done.
-Done.

[horns honking]


Hey, Alton.

Hey, good news, boss.

Looks like we might
be closing our Moses park
deal tomorrow.

That's what I'm talking about.

-Let's get this money.
-Let's get it.

-Listen, I'ma holler at you
later, all right?
-All right.

Thank you.

-Hey. I was just
about to close.
-I saw that you called.

I was in surgery. You hungry?

Clay, I'm... I just wanted
to say sorry about last night.

That's why I called. [inhales]

I, uh... [exhales]

you know what I liked
about you
back in college, iris?

-You were always kind.
Even when you said no.
-[laughs]

you still are.

I don't know what
you were feeling last night,
but I know what I feel.

I know how I felt.

I finally have the chance
to really get to know you.

And I plan to take my shot.

-Unless you're gonna
turn me down...
-[laughs] no.

...For the fourth time.

Okay.

-Okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

["gratitude" playing]

-dark roast, three sugars.
-[laughs]

<i> â™ª she got style â™ª</i>

large iced latte.
Light on ice.

Five pumps of vanilla syrup.

A splash of oat milk.
Three shots of espresso
and a dash of cinnamon.

I told you I was
paying attention. [laughs]

-you said something
about second chances.
-I did.

Mmm-hmm.

-I think I missed
an opportunity last night.
-To do what?

<i> â™ª so much love â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª in a touch â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª show my gratitude â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª and every time... â™ª</i>

I've been waiting
for that for a long time.

<i> â™ª we touch, girl â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª ooh, it's so divine â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª and every time</i>
<i> we touch, girl... â™ª</i>


-Baker gave you my info?
-You two stayed in touch, huh?

We reconnected
a couple months ago.

Getting some Intel
on the community.

-Oh, so you could call baker
but you couldn't call...
-don't even go there, tan.

You made it clear
a long time ago
you didn't want me around.

-Is that what you
honestly think?
-What was I supposed to think?

You left me to
figure out shit on my own.

I didn't have nobody.

-You had the Hendersons.
-I had a sister.

You wouldn't even
pick up the phone.
You wouldn't talk to me.

Yeah, well,
you should have kept calling.

I did. And I have.

Look, I know I hurt you.

-But from the looks
of things, I mean...
-really?

I lost my parents. My grandma.
My sister.

But, hey, at least
I got a nice office.

That better life you wanted
for me, tan, never happened.

The Hendersons got a divorce.
He drank himself to death.
She went on welfare.

I ended up on my own
being exactly who you tried
to keep me from being.

But I figured it out.
All by myself.

Elijah, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Elijah. Okay?
I was just a kid.

Just hope that you could look
into your heart

and just find a way
to forgive me.

No, tanner.

I can't.

Okay.

what you and your
little development company

are doing to Moses park?

It's disgusting.

Grandma tried
to lift people up.

But you should be
ashamed of yourself.

I know I am,
and grandma would be, too.

[door slams shut]

[exhaling and sniffling]
okay. Okay.

[traffic noise

[keys jingle]


[Beverly exclaims] what...


I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,
but maybe you were right.

I think you should
give tanner a second chance.

Yeah.

-It's okay.
-[sniffles]

-it's okay.
-[exhales] yeah.

I'm good.
Just give me a minute, okay?

Okay.

I'm gonna give Alton
a call to reschedule.

Okay.

[phone ringing]

Alton.

-So, uh, the meeting
with opal's got pushed.
<i> -You know what, that's good.</i>

I want you to sit tight
on all that for a minute.

Why? What's going on?

Just need to rethink
some things.

All right. No doubt.

[sighing heavily]

[sniffling and exhaling]

welcome to haven house.
There's lots of women
and children here.

And you can stay
as long as you want.

Because this is god's house.
And god's house welcomes
everybody. Come on in.

I know this place.


Five more minutes.

<i> god's house,</i>

and god's house welcomes
everybody. Hey.

[necklace jingling]

now, run along, babies.
Now, run on.

Go along. Go.

[young tanner
and Elijah laughing]


[car door opens]

iris.

Have you lived here?
You and your mom?

-Yes. I'm so sorry.
-Did you know this... I was...

-tanner.
-It was because...

I had no... I had no idea.
I just... I found these
in the studio.

I saw haven house.

And I saw miss Maeble's house,
and I saw her face,

and I remember everything.
Your grandmother.

Your grandmother died
because of me, tanner.

[Lester shouting] stop her!

[all shouting and screaming]

-let me go. Please go.
-[Maeble] just go.

-[Lester] opal!
-Go.

-[iris crying]
-just go!

-[Lester] opal!
-[iris screams]

-[Maeble] oh, no. Just go!
-[Lester] huh?

-Just go!
-Grandma Maeble, behind you.

Opal... lady, I told you.
Get the hell out of the way.

Lester. Lester.
This is not the way to go.

I ain't going anywhere
without opal.

Okay? Move.

-[iris screaming] mom!
-[Lester] opal. Opal. Hey.

Stop it. Lester, stop.
What are you doing?
Leave her alone.

Leave her alone!
What's wrong with you!

What did I tell you?
What did I say?


-grandma Maeble!
-What did I tell you, huh?

What did I tell you?

[Maeble gasping]

no!


[tanner and Elijah] grandma!

[tanner and Elijah crying]

-grandma!
-[Maeble gasping]

grandma! Grandma!

I'm sorry!

Grandma!

Grandma. [crying]


It's all my fault. [sobbing]

I'm sorry!

I'm sorry!

I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

I don't expect you
to be able to
forgive me or my mom.

You know what
grandma Maeble told me
a long time ago?


me and Elijah asked her
about grace.

And she said,
"grace is god's love,
mercy, and forgiveness."

-[exhaling sharply]
-he gives it freely.

And he wants us
to do the same.

She did that for you
and your mom.

-And for so many other people.
-She saved my life.

-No, no...
-no, she saved my life.

No, iris.

You saved my life.

Thank you.


Elijah?

Tanner.

Give him some grace, tanner.

Give him some grace.

-Yeah.
-[Elijah] tanner, wait. Wait.

I was wrong.

Look, I heard
what you said earlier.

About wanting
what was best for me.

I heard what you said
about grandma's love
for the community.

And I remember
what grandma said about
grace and forgiveness.

Tan, I'm sorry.

I was just angry and hurt.

And I'm tired of hurting.

I'm tired of hiding.

Part of me knew that
you would find me when
I was back here.

Guess I was ready
to be found.

[sighs in relief]

-Elijah. I love you so much.
-I love you, too.

-[sniffles] and
I missed you so much.
-I missed you, too.

Remember how you used
to always hold my hand
when we were kids?

you used to hate it.


I wanna show you something.

I wanna find ways to
uplift the community like
grandma Maeble did.

I bought her house.
I bought haven house.

Figured it'd be
a great place to start.

I'm sure you'd make
grandma Maeble proud.
