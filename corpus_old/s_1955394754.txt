           (silence)            

        (wings flapping)        

   (thunder and pouring rain)   

            - Oh no.            

            Oh fuck.            

             Fuck!              

       Fuck, fuck, fuck,        
      fuck, fucking shit!       

       (screams in agony)       

       (classical music)        

[Thomas] Relax druggie Dougie.

 - Don't fucking call me that.  

  My name is Doug, or Douglas.  

      I'm a fucking adult!      

    - I believe he's trying     
    to assert his authority.    

      - Are you trying to       
     assert your authority?     

       - Maybe he thinks        
      he's in charge here.      

    - Do you think you're in    
  charge here, druggie Dougie?  

       - Don't fuckin'--        

        (fist slamming)         

       - What did I say?        

       - He said to relax       
        druggie Dougie.         

            (sighs)             

            - I did.            

        I said to relax.        

             Right?             

  - What do you want from me?   

   - We want to see how much    
     you love your new God?     

       - Are you familiar       
        with yubitsume?         

Yeah, it's that brown chicken 
   dish at fucking Benihana.    

    - No Doug, it's a ritual    
    practiced by the Yakuza.    

Yubitsume is a form of apology. 

   If a member of the Yakuza    
    were to dishonor himself    

   or one of his bosses he'd    
   be required to perform it.   

        - Perform what?         

  - He'd be asked to use this.  

         (eerie music)          

      - To cut the tip of       
     his pinky finger off.      

       (soft eerie music)       

     - Fuck, fuck you guys.     

  I'm not cutting the fucking   
     tip of my finger off!      

       - Oh that's up to        
      you druggie Dougie.       

    - Yes, we're not the low    
    life drug addicts here.     

       - This stuff, this       
      means nothing to us.      

    - We just as soon flush     
      it down the toilet.       

          - We would.           

        But we know you         
      wouldn't like that.       

       - You're what they       
      call a super addict.      

     And besides we're only     
       asking for a pinky       

         you big baby.          

       - It's gonna hurt        
       like fucking shit!       

             - Wow.             

It really only tickles a little.

     - And you'll have that     
       sweet, sweet crack       

     to take the edge off.      

      And then we'll drive      
       you to a hospital,       

       they'll patch you        
       up neat and tidy.        

        - This is, this         
       is fucking fucked.       

        - So is chemical        
  dependance, but here we are.  

      And you've certainly      
      dishonored yourself.      

     So I can't think of a      
   more apropos way to atone.   

     - Just the tip, right?     

         - That's all.          

        - So what do you        
      say druggie Dougie,       

       pinky or no pinky?       

       - And you fuckers        
      are going to take me      

     to the hospital right      
       afterwards, right?       

   - My golden word of honor.   

     - Let's up the ante a      
     little bit, shall we?      

   Odds are you've never seen   
   a kilo of cocaine before,    

      so feast your eyes.       

    - It's still yubitsume.     

            - But--             

    you do have to use this.    

            - Fuck.             

      Oh and how the fuck       
        am I supposed to        

cut my finger off with a rock!? 

        - Figure it out.        

      That's your problem       
        druggie Dougie.         

    - Or you can go for the     

     small package instead      

     and just use the knife     
      like a little bitch.      

        Shall we count?         

           - Fuck it!           

      - You got this Doug!      

       (screams in agony)       

        (wild screaming)        

          - It hurts!           

         - Go, go, go!          

      - It fucking hurts!       

           It hurts!            

     - Just severe the bone     
      and you're all free!      

         Oh do it Doug!         

           One more!            

        (yelps in agony)        

             - Wow!             

           Oh my God!           

    Douglas, I am impressed.    

         Unbelievable.          

        You were right.         

     - See I told you, drug     
   addicts will do anything.    

            - Help!             

 - Well I am a man of my word,  
    you won fair and square.    

          - Thank you.          

       (heavy breathing)        

 - What the fuck is that about? 

  - Oh you see, I bet a dollar  
  that you would use the rock,  

      but Charles here, he      
     thought you'd puss out     

     and go for the knife.      

      - You bet on me you       
        yuppie assholes!        

       (amused chuckling)       

       What's so funny!?        

        - It's powdered         
     sugar druggie Dougie.      

And the packet was rock salt. 

   (condescending chuckling)    

   - You fucking dick holes.    

           Fuck you.            

      Just take me to the       
        hospital please.        

      - Now where are our       
      keys druggie Dougie?      

   - If they've been snakes--   

        - They would've         
       bitten me, I know.       

 - You can't walk away from me. 

     - Have to dash druggie     
     Dougie, it's been fun.     

      - Don't you fucking       
         leave me here!         

        Fucking help me!        

 (suspenseful electronic music) 

        (alarm ringing)         

           (knocking)           

   - Mother, are you decent?    

  - When am I ever not decent?  

    Are you trying to imply     
    I'm not a lady, Charlie?    

    - Of course not mother.     

       How did you sleep?       

          - Terribly.           

         Oh, if I could         
       move without pain,       

       I would've tossed        
     and turned all night.      

   - I'm sorry to hear that.    

You are still beautiful though. 

            - Yeah?             
             - Mhm.             

Am I still your favorite girl?

      - Forever and ever.       

      - You sure got that       
        look sweetheart.        

      - Thank you mother.       

       - What time is it?       

      Oh, would you get my      
     medicine for me baby.      

    - I'd be glad to sweets.    

          - Thank you.          

       I had the weirdest       
       dream last night.        

        - You don't say.        

     - Yeah, I was standing     
   in the middle of the road    

     watching this horribly     
         disfigured man         

being pulled out of a car wreck.

           (chuckles)           

        And guess what?         

            - What?             

It started to rain rose petals. 

Isn't that the damnedest thing? 

     And to top it off the      
   police and the paramedics    

    around the wreck stopped    
      pulling the guy out       

   and started dancing around   
like it was a Broadway musical. 

          - Then what?          

    - Then my son called me     
   indecent and here we are.    

           - Oh hush.           

        Do you know what        
        Freud would say?        

   - Oh who gives two wooden    
 nickels what Freud would say.  

That's all psychobabble anyway. 

        - Probably true.        

     It's all just a series     
     of dreamed up notions.     

        - Barely 11 am,         

        and Freud is the        
      topic of discussion.      

        I'm missing out.        

    - Good morning, Thomas.     

     - Good morning mumsie.     

       - You two were out       
        late last night.        

       I hope you weren't       
   getting into any trouble.    

      - Not in the least.       

        - Is that true?         

       - Yes, of course.        

            - Good.             

           - Charles.           

        (keys jingling)         

           Breakfast.           

       - Have a good day.       

       - You too mother.        

             - Hmm.             

      (eerie quiet rumble)      

 - Is there anything in there?  

         - About what?          

      - About last night.       

    - Oh I'm sure our friend    
  Dougie either bled to death   

    in a gutter somewhere or    
     he patched himself up.     

      Also, do me a favor.      

   Never bring up Doug again.   

     Better for all of us.      

          - Of course.          

           I'm sorry.           

     - No, never be sorry.      

         You know that.         

       Sorry is a sign of       
       weakness Charles,        

     and that is one thing      
    we cannot afford to be.     

      - More coffee guys?       

           - Please.            
      - [Charles] Please.       

        (coffee pouring)        

Genevieve, what a pretty name.

          - Thank you.          

    I actually pronounce it     
   Genevieve, sounds fancier.   

       - You're new here.       

      - Yeah, just started      
      yesterday actually.       

         - Well we're a         
      couple of regulars,       

       so we'll be seeing       
      lots of each other.       

          - Oh, great.          

     - I'm Thomas, and this     
      less handsome devil       

    with the pancake in his     
  mouth is my brother Charles.  

    - Oh, I'm sorry, hello.     

  - Hi, I'm Genevieve, again.   

            - Mommy.            

        - And that's my         
       daughter, Maddie.        

   Well you guys need a fill    
     up just give a shout.      

     - Now that's a kind of     
  woman man was made to ruin.   

           Genevieve.           

       (exhales in shock)       

       You look like you        
      could use a fill up.      

        (yelps in pain)         

           You could.           

    (intense dramatic music)    

       (heavy breathing)        

           - Thomas.            

            Thomas.             

            Thomas!             

        You're creaming         
      all over the place.       

 Did you go away for a moment?  

   - She's got some big hips.   

      It's a good sign of       
       a healthy uterus.        

       - Can we please go       
      one day without you       

     using the word uterus?     

         - It's my very         
    favorite word, Charles,     

       can't help myself.       

        I'm in the mood         
       for a movie today.       

              You?              

      (laughing on screen)      

    We should get a hooker.     

       - [Charles] What?        

       - [Thomas] Did you       
       put salt in this?        

          - A little.           

 - Doesn't taste like a little. 

    - What about the hooker?    

    - Oh, we should get one.    

             - Why?             

      - Because it's time.      

     - So, so we're really      
        going to do it?         

     You think we're ready?     

    - You're not chickening     
      out on me, are you?       

             - No.              

     I just didn't think we     
    were ready, that's all.     

         - We're ready.         

    We've tested ourselves,     
    and we've tested others.    

  I say we just push forward.   

    - So what do we do, just    
   call up an escort service?   

         And then what?         

  - No, no you idiot, we don't  
just call up an escort service. 

   That leaves a paper trail.   

    You're supposed to have     
   the higher IQ here, right?   

   - So what, we just pick up   
   a girl off of the street?    

     - Yes, we just pick up     
     a girl off the street,     

      take her to a motel.      

          - Oh, motel?          

  Isn't that leaving a trail?   

       - We pay cash, she       
        books the room,         

    no one sees us with her.    

          - All right.          

     Also we should rent a      
     car, so their hooker--     

             - No.              

      I don't leave paper.      

 We'll borrow our mother's car. 

She won't be needing it anyway. 

      - What kind of girl       
      should we get then?       

      - Any kind, doesn't       
         matter to me.          

     It's all the same meat     
       in the end anyway.       

   - Would you two dick holes   
   please shut the fuck up!?    

 I'm trying to watch the film.  

         Just shut up!          

 - We're not animals, Charles.  

   Though he is on the list.    

     - It shouldn't just be     
    any kind of girl though.    

     She should be special.     

            - Okay.             

          So you pick.          

It really doesn't matter to me. 

       (forcibly exhales)       

      - Your indifference       
        is suffocating.         

       - My indifference        
        is justifiable.         

  No one's gonna care one eye   
   about any of these girls.    

         Pretty or not.         

      (quiet eerie music)       

          - That one.           

       - That gaudy one?        

    She's decrepit Charles.     

            Why her?            

       - She's beautiful.       

     She looks like mother.     

          - All right.          

             Legs.              

        - Evening boys.         

      How can I help you?       

    - Well my brother and I     
  have carefully selected you   

   for tonight's indulgence.    

         - Selected me?         

          Both of ya?           

      You wouldn't happen       
     to be cops, would ya?      

  - Oh no ma'am, just regular   
red blooded American horn dogs. 

    - Yeah, I can see that.     

 - I'm Drew, and this is Hank.  

         - Nice to meet         
       ya, Drew and Hank.       

          I'm Vanity.           

      - [Charles] Is that       
        your real name?         

    - No, of course it's not    
     my real fuckin' name.      

      - [Thomas] So are we      
      gonna party or what?      

   - I'll just get my purse.    

        (door creaking)         

     We could've gone some      
     place nice, you know?      

    - Dirty places for dirty    
     things, I always say.      

   - I'm gonna go freshen up.   

     - How should we do it?     

       - You wanna sleep        
      with her, don't you?      

   We can't rape her Charles,   
   it'll leave semen behind.    

       Even with a condom       
      it wouldn't be safe.      

      - Did you smell her?      

     Her scent, she stinks      
        off cooked meat.        

     - That's because it's      
       not meat brother,        

 that is the smell of impurity. 

 - So how should we do it then? 

   - Let's just roll with the   
 punches and see what develops. 

        - So what do you        
        two little pervs        

   wanna do with me tonight?    

     - A great many things.     

        - You don't have        
       to call me ma'am.        

        I'm your whore,         
      not your librarian.       

  Now I can be if you want to.  

 So we ridin' solo or tag team? 

   I don't do anal, usually.    

        Though I can be         
      financially coerced.      

       I don't swallow--        

  - This is a nonsmoking room.  

          - Seriously?          

      - Cigarettes are the      
     leading cause of death     

     in the United States.      

          - Okie doke.          

      Well you boys are in      
       charge, so let's--       

          - Oh no, no.          

   You're in charge tonight.    

We want you to take the reigns. 

  - I like your style blondie.  

      You can come first.       

         (guitar music)         

   Do you like what you see?    

     I've always wanted to      
      be a ballet dancer.       

 - Yet you became a prostitute. 

       - Well life's what       
    happens when you're busy    

      making other plans.       

Isn't that the bullshit saying. 

       Like God works in        
   mysterious ways, whatever.   

   - How many sexual partners   
      have you had Vanity?      

            - Many.             

           Too many.            

    - What would your mother    
  think about all this Vanity?  

  - She'd say I hope those two  

  sexy brothers tip well dear.  

     You know what's funny?     

        This is actually        
      my biggest fantasy.       

       Well not exactly,        
       but close enough.        

     - What are you doing?      

   I'm gonna suck your cock,    
     is that okay with you?     

         (eerie music)          

           (slurping)           

       (heavy breathing)        

   Gimme a chance to warm up!   

         - Get off me!          

        You disgust me.         

         - You fucker!          

 - Thomas what are you doing!?  

      - She's not the one!      

      - Not the one, what,      
       what do you mean!?       

She's so impure, she's rotten!

    She can't be our first.     

       - I'm your first?        

      (laughing mockingly)      

       - Thomas wait up!        

            Thomas!             

  - Get away from me Charles.   

           - Thomas.            

    Hey, I'm talking to you.    

      Hey, what happened!?      

       - She wasn't pure!       

   She wasn't pure, Charles.    

       She was a piece of       
        garbage nothing.        

       It was all wrong.        

          - All wrong?          

      How is it all wrong?      

  We knew what she was before   
 we ever walked into that room. 

           - No, no.            

 You see, it's the wrong tack.  

We're going about it all wrong. 

           - Are we?            

Or did you just lose your spine?

  - What did you to say to me?  

What the hell did you say to me?

        Don't you ever!         

          - I'm sorry.          

      - Don't you ever say      
       that to me again!        

       I did not lose my        
        spine you idiot!        

     How could you not see      
     that she wasn't right?     

      Or you're too stupid      
         to understand?         

    - How wasn't she right?     

 We were supposed to kill her,  
   not put her on a pedestal.   

        - That's exactly        
       my point Charles.        

       We should put them       
         on a pedestal.         

    At least our first one.     

  It shouldn't be some thrown   
    away street trash tramp,    

   it should be someone who's   
  death would mean something.   

Hookers get killed all the time.

         Life goes on.          

        We need them to         
      remember what we do       

      and who we do it to.      

       (heavy breathing)        

      - Well, we could've       
       just strung her up       

     and made it look like      
   Jack the Ripper got to her   

  and that would've made ink.   

            - Nooo!             

       Keep in mind this        
       is an experiment,        

     a test of the superior     
        intellect versus        

    the weak minded cattle.     

For it to lead to transcendence 
  it's got to mean something!   

  But for it to mean something  
   we must also make it art.    

    It must be a defiant act    
     of our above all else.     

    The victims are as much     
     part of it as we are.      

  They are the canvas Charles.  

         - Don't worry.         

           - And we--           

        - You will live.        

Are the goddamn paintbrushes. 

      (tense eerie music)       

    - I saw the light coming    
  out from underneath the door  

  and figured you were awake.   

       - Yeah, I'm having       
       trouble sleeping.        

      - Anything I can do?      

 - Tuck me in, sing me a song?  

            - Okay.             

     (ambient eerie music)      

      - You look worried.       

    Is everything all right?    

       - Yeah, I'm fine.        

   Just got a lot on my mind.   

        - You know I can        
     read you like a book.      

     Something isn't right.     

       - There's nothing.       

    - We're supposed to tell    
     each other everything.     

          No secrets.           

         Is it Thomas?          

        He's weak and--         

          - No mother.          

      Everything is fine.       

       - Hmm, boy wasn't        
     that the look you got.     

     - Let's see, what song     
    would you like to hear?     

       - Well I could use       
       a little sunshine.       

         - You got it.          

       ¶ Sunshine baby ¶        

       ¶ It's sunshine ¶        

    ¶ Time to wake up baby ¶    

        (chilling music)        

   ¶ Oh it's sunshine baby ¶    

        ¶ All for you ¶         

      (suspenseful music)       

       - [Genevieve] Good       
       evening stranger.        

        - Hey Genevieve.        

       - You remembered?        

       Sit wherever, it's       
      super dead tonight.       

    - I will if you join me.    

             - Um.              

       (soft piano music)       

  Cookie dough's my favorite,   
     but we don't carry it.     

    - I've never really been    
   a big fan of cookie dough.   

      - Most guys aren't.       

    Maybe it's a girl thing.    

       - So I guess your        
    husband doesn't mind you    

  working the graveyard shift.  

       - I'm not married.       

     - Oh, I figured since.     

       - Getting pregnant       
      and getting married       

   can be mutually exclusive.   

         It was just a          

    stupid time in my life.     

         I don't regret         
      having my daughter.       

    I love my little Maddie.    

      - You have a tattoo.      

           - Oh yeah.           

  Souvenir from the old days.   

       - It's beautiful.        

           - Thanks.            

        Maddie likes it.        

   So tell me about yourself.   

        What do you do?         

       What do you like?        

           You okay?            

Yeah, nervous twitch I guess. 

       - Are you nervous?       

          - Well yes.           

    After all I am all alone    
   with a very strange woman    

     and there's no telling     
     what you'll do to me.      

   - You're safe in my hands.   

        - Good to know.         

    (ambient relaxing music)    

      - So what about your      
   brother, what does he do?    

        - He's a writer.        

       He wants to write        
       true crime books,        

   he's fascinated by death.    

   - Oh, I couldn't do that.    

         There's enough         
     ugliness in the world      

    to go digging for more.     

         Back to work.          

       Grab a seat, I'll        
       be right with you.       

    - Are you seeing anyone?    

      (exhales nervously)       

          I am sorry.           

     I didn't mean to blurt     
      that out just then,       

        it's just I was         
       wondering if maybe       

    you'd like to go with me    
    to the movies sometime.     

  - Are you into chick flicks?  

    - Not particularly, no.     

    - Too bad, you'll learn.    

        (police sirens)         

           (laughter)           

        (crowd giggling)        

        That was funny.         

        (chilling music)        

       - You're glowing.        

            - I am?             

        - It's blinding.        

           - Thanks.            

            - May I?            

            - What?             

  - I want to hold your hand.   

          - Oh, sure.           

        - I can feel it.        

      - What did you say?       

         - Oh, nothing.         

           I'm sorry.           

    (cinema crowd laughing)     

You have any cocoa chocolates?

      - We got movie shit.      

That was actually really good.

     - I would go with the      
      definition of trite.      

       - You're kidding,        
        it was so sweet.        

       - Oh hey, you two!       

             - Hi!              

      - I didn't know you       
    were seeing this movie.     

        Wasn't it good?         

   - I know, and the ending.    

         - Who would've         
      thought he'd make it      

       to the altar after       
       all those mishaps?       

             Right?             

            - Right!            

        It was so good.         

 - What did you think Charles?  

  - Um, I thought it was okay.  

            - Okay.             

     This is the man who'd      
        argue the merits        

      of Bela Tarr's films      
     versus Bergman's work      

       and all he can say       
        is it was okay.         

       - Some films only        
        deserve an okay.        

     Can't like all art, it     
    would defeat the purpose    

       of personal intent       
         and free will.         

        - Well put sir.         

     Ugh, goddamn battery.      

     Charles do you mind if     
      I borrow your phone?      

   My mom's watching Maddie.    

      I didn't really tell      
      her I was gonna be.       

      - He doesn't have a       
      cell phone actually.      

 - It can lead to brain cancer. 

      - Though we do have       
        a phone at home         

       just right around        
     the corner from here.      

         - Oh, maybe I          
      should just go home.      

     I gotta work tonight.      

   - Don't be a silly goose,    
    come on over for lunch.     

     I'm an excellent cook.     

   Hey, you like pasta, huh?    

        - I love pasta.         

          - Fantastic!          

Stay for an hour, Charles here, 

      he'll take you home.      

      You know what, call       
     Maddie, call your mom,     

   bring the whole clan over.   

      I'm part Italian, we      
      love big gatherings.      

        What do you say?        

              Huh?              

            - Okay!             

   (laughs enthusiastically)    

     (somber violin music)      

     - Welcome to our home.     

              Wow.              

 - Just make yourself at home.  

  Phone has been on the fritz.  

       I'm just gonna go        
       get my cell phone,       

      I don't really care       
      about brain cancer.       

            - Okay.             

      (soft gloomy music)       

        - What were you         
     doing at the theater?      

         Spying on us?          

        - She's perfect.        

 - What are you talking about?  

   - Don't play dumb Charles.   

  She's beautiful, she's kind,  

she's loved by those around her 

     she even is a mother.      

    She's so bloody perfect.    

             - No.              

     No, I don't think so.      

     - You don't think so?      

    Then why were you going     
       out with her today       

         if you weren't         
      testing the waters?       

   I'll be a monkey's uncle,    

      you like this girl.       

       You honest to God        
      and the baby angels       

   actually like this girl!?    

          - She glows.          

        - What about me?        

  What about your big brother?  

     What am I supposed to      
      do when you kick me       

     to the curb for this,      
        for this woman!?        

What do you even know about her?

            - Okay.             

   - You know she's probably    
      as loose as Vanity?       

All women are the same Charles. 

 You and I need to remain pure. 

   Have you forgotten that!?    

         - Okay, okay.          

  - What do you want me to do?  

       You're breaking my       
      heart here Charles.       

        Am I supposed to        
      just give up on you?      

        Because I won't.        

     You're my baby brother     
        and it's my job         

       to keep you safe.        

         - I said okay.         

          - Atta boy.           

           You know--           

     she is a pretty little     
       thing, isn't she?        

       Maybe it wouldn't        
       be a half bad idea       

   to marry a gal like that.    

       - Kill her Thomas.       

   - Who needs the headache?    

     If she glows like you      
      say, she's the one.       

       She's our canvas.        

          - Okay fine.          

       So how do we do--        

       - Follow my lead.        

 - Well as luck would have it,  

     I can't really seem to     
      find the damn thing.      

        - Oh, okay well         
       that's all right.        

      They can do without       
     me for an hour or so.      

          - Atta girl.          

Now let me occupy your mind with
  some fettuccine of the gods.  

      How does that sound?      

            - Great.            

           (giggles)            

            - Great.            

        Shall we shrimp?        

         You allergic?          

           - Nuh-uh.            

        - Let's shrimp.         

      - [Mother] Charlie!       

   - Charles, mother beckons.   

      - Is your mom here?       

     - [Mother] Sweetheart!     

   - Yeah, she's, she's sick.   

      I'll be right back.       

      - Old lady problems.      

     - [Mother] You're not      
    being a bad boy are you?    

        - No, no mother.        

  - Thomas isn't doing things   
 he shouldn't be doing, is he?  

   Putting ideas in your head   
  that shouldn't be put there.  

    - No mother, I promise.     

      - He's like a canker      
        sore, that boy.         

Always trying to be the big man.

       Oh, I'm sure glad        
       you got that look.       

        Top me off, will        
        you honey bunch?        

      - Of course mother.       

   (mother breathing heavily)   

I want to try and get some sleep

       so you can have a        
     little peace and quiet     

       with your friend.        

     - So Charles tells me      
   you're into serial killers   

     and things like that.      

             - Mhm.             

    I like the obscure ones,    

   Earl Nelson, Henri Landru.   

     To a degree I consider     
    them artists, geniuses.     

           - Really?            

         I don't know.          

       I mean what would        
        possess someone         

        to want to kill         
      another human being?      

 I don't consider that genius,  
    I consider it insanity.     

    - There are Neanderthals    
     everywhere, Genevieve.     

      There are predators       
      and there are prey.       

      The trick is to eat       
      before you're eaten.      

      - Well maybe that's       
       true to a degree,        

   but I don't think killing    
       should be admired.       

      I certainly wouldn't      
      wanna live that way.      

Then you will be swallowed up.

    Survival of the fittest.    

     - Wow, life's already      
        swallowed me up.        

       Best I can do now        
      is teach my daughter      

        to be bigger and        
       better than mommy.       

       - All parents want       
    that, most of them fail.    

   - Has anyone ever told you   
   you sound like an asshole?   

     - Not to my face, no.      

           Thank you.           

          - Oh my God.          

        You are radiant.        

Way to cover for your brother.

          - I mean it.          

        You're glorious.        

         - Okay, okay.          

   Let's get this over with.    

     - What are you doing?      

We have been waiting for this 

     for a very long time.      

          - For what?           

             - You.             

        You, young lady,        

 are gonna be our masterpiece.  

Charles, tell him to back off.

     This shit ain't funny.     

            - Funny?            

 You think I'm playing around,  

        Miss Genevieve?         

    What kind of hoity-toity    
      shitty name is that?      

   Stuck up bitches like you    
  are better off dead, I say.   

      Charles, it's here--      

          (shattering)          

           - Thomas!            

    (crashing and breaking)     

           (yelling)            

 Thomas, Thomas, are you okay?  

         Are you okay?          

            Thomas?             

      She's getting away.       

  She's getting away, Thomas.   

            Come on!            

          (trembling)           

   - Someone help me, please.   

            (crying)            

  - [Charles] She's suffering.  

       It's so beautiful.       

      - [Thomas] Charles?       

[Genevieve] Help me, help me. 

          (whimpering)          

     - Look at her, Thomas.     

           - Go away.           

         - Look at her.         

            - Stop.             
          (trembling)           

        Charles, please.        

 Why are you doing this to me?  

  - I'm not doing this to you.  

    I'm doing this for you,     

   because you're beautiful.    

 - I didn't do anything to you. 

         - You glowed.          

   Because you are glorious.    

      (hitting and crying)      

     (soft ethereal music)      

           (pounding)           

    (vomiting and pounding)     

           - Charles.           

             Stop.              

           (pounding)           

 God damn it, Charles, stop it. 

        Leave her alone.        

          She's dead.           

       (heavy breathing)        

   (eerie instrumental music)   

     We took her face off.      

 We took her God damn face off. 

       What should we do?       

           Oh Jesus.            

       (soft eerie music)       

       - It's beautiful.        

            Thomas.             

      It was a divine act.      

         It was divine.         

     The universe approves.     

           (laughing)           

  Did you see when I told her   

it was because she was glorious?

          She smiled.           

      Like she was giving       
         me permission.         

  - She didn't fucking smile.   

        Why did you keep        
        that damn thing?        

  - It's one of my souvenirs.   

     What's wrong with you?     

        You're shaking.         

           - Nothing.           

           Forget it.           

     - Thomas, I know you.      

         What's wrong?          

            I mean--            

       We pulled it off.        

      We did it, you know?      

            - Yeah.             

           We did it.           

        The problem is--        

       I didn't like it.        

       It shouldn't have        
        been like that.         

What should it have been like?

        - I don't know.         

     I don't fucking know.      

        - You don't have        
       to curse, Thomas,        

   there's not need for that.   

I don't have to fucking curse?

       Fuck you, Charles.       

       It shouldn't have        
        felt like that.         

          - Like what?          

            - Pity.             

            I felt,             

         sorry for her.         

            - Well.             

I'm sorry to hear you say that. 

     (eerie haunting music)     

         (door opening)         

 - Swinberg, long time no see.  

              Hey!              

       How are the kids.        

    - I don't have children.    

  - I meant you're balls, pal.  

You have testicle cancer, right?

     - Yeah, how did you--      

             Right.             

         They're fine.          

     They're in remission.      

 - So, I'm coming in late here. 

          Fill me in.           

       - Female, age 26.        

  - Jesus, what is this, man?   

       - We found her off       
     the side of the road,      

     off Cold Water Canyon.     

Someone took a rock to her face,

        multiple times.         

        - Rock for sure?        

  - Well, we couldn't find it.  

       But, all the rock        
      debris in her wounds      

   is consistent with a rock    
     as the murder weapon.      

      - No prints on her?       

      - No, she was clean.      

 We're still waiting on fibers, 

      but the site wasn't       
       exactly pristine,        

    so it may take a while.     

        Also, we found a        
     patch of skin missing      

     behind her right ear.      

   It looks hastily removed.    

    Probably a trophy piece.    

      - Of course it was.       

   He probably framed it too.   

         Okay, darling.         

   Let's see if we can't find   
    out who did this to you.    

           (gasping)            

       - Up for a movie?        

        (pouring coffee)        

        I'm in the mood.        

           - I'm not.           

       - You can have it.       

I wasn't going to eat it anyway.

      - How did you know?       

          - I saw it.           

       I think I can see        
        everything now.         

          (chuckling)           

         - Sorry, boys.         

  Didn't mean to startle you.   

       May I cop a squat?       

         Pun intended.          

     - Of course, Officer.      

       - It's Detective.        

     Detective Homer Gaul.      

As long as we've got that clear,

        you can call me         
       Homer, we're pals.       

       - Well, how can we       
        help you, Homer?        

     - Not sure if you boys     
    have heard the bad news,    

   but one of the waitresses    
        that worked here        

       was found murdered       
        late last night.        

            - Oh no.            

       My goodness, who?        

   - Oh, pretty little thing.   

    Named Genevieve Du Bois.    

       You boys know her.       

  - We knew her somewhat, yes.  

      She would wait on us      
   whenever we came in here.    

   - Well, that's the reason    
     I'm bugging you folks.     

        You see, I asked        
    Angelo, the owner here,     

      to pick out for me a      
      few of the regulars,      

    and he fingered you two,    

      among a few others.       

    - Well, we are certainly    
  regulars, aren't we Thomas?   

           - Uh, yes.           

And, you two are what friends?

            Lovers?             

        Nothing unsavory        
      or illegal going on       

   under this table is there?   

          (chuckling)           

  - No, Homer, we're brothers.  

   I'm Charles Brubaker, and    
   this is Thomas Lo Bianco.    

       - Different dads?        

         - You got it.          

       You must be really       
      good at what you do.      

       - You flatter me.        

           (chuckles)           

          It's a gift.          

   - Here you go, Detective.    

      - Ah, Homer, please,      
     we're pals, remember?      

     Now, lemme-- (sipping)     

              Mmm!              

              Oh!               

      Oh, Angelo, Angelo,       
        Angelo, Angelo.         

       This is the first        
       time I've actually       

     tasted coffee the way      
    it was meant to be made.    

    (chuckling and sipping)     

              Mmm!              

  Have you tried this coffee?   

          Astounding!           

       It's like cinnamon       
     and Jesus had a baby.      

  - Don't trust him, Charles.   

           Kill him.            

        - You boys ever         
      chat with Genevieve?      

         See her at all         
      outside this place?       

     - I can't say we have.     

       Wanted to though.        

     She sure was a pretty      
      young little thing,       

         like you said.         

            - Yeah.             

        Of course, I was        
      going off pictures.       

      Whoever killed her--      

  Man, those twisted bastards   
  really did a number on her.   

     - How was she killed?      

           - Charles!           

      - It really wouldn't      
     help the investigation     

      if I started running      
         my mouth about         

    the sensitive details of    
    the case, now would it?     

    Turn on the local news.     

 I imagine all the gory details 
   will be in the 6 o'clock.    

      Now, if I wanted to       
    reach you fellas again,     

      how would I do that?      

Well, this is our home number.

       And that's in gold       
         leaf too, FYI.         

   - Pals, I wanna thank you.   

     - Ah, ah, ah, Thomas,      
        manners, please.        

   - Is it something I said?    

     My aunt always told me     
      to modulate my tone.      

    I hope I haven't been--     

No, it's just that we're sick.

  Wouldn't want to spread it.   

       Besides, you have        
       work to do, Homer.       

     Taking a sick day now      
   would just slow you down.    

      - That's really very      
       thoughtful of you.       

        Talk soon, pals.        

 Hey, can I talk to you folks.  

     - Did you see his cup?     

        He had the glow.        

       - He came over to        
        shake our hands.        

     - How can you be sure?     

  - How 'bout a foreign film?   

        Something long.         

    - I'm not feeling well.     

         Take me home.          

 - Suit yourself, party pooper. 

           (kissing)            

  - Oh, let's take a picture.   

        (camera shutter)        

       - That one's good.       

     (kissing and moaning)      

             - Shh!             

     (kissing and giggling)     

     Excuse me, old timer.      

     (kissing and giggling)     

            (typing)            

      (suspenseful music)       

 (slurping and dramatic music)  

      - My God, you pervs.      

        Get out of here.        

         Out, out, out.         

    Hurry, move, move, move.    

    Have I seen you before?     

       Move, move, move.        

   (eerie suspenseful music)    

         - Psychic cop.         

        You've gotta be         
      fucking kidding me.       

        (pouring drink)         

       (squeaking wheels)       

        - Mrs. Du Bois?         

    - Oh, hello, Detective.     

        - How we doin'?         

      - Well, we're just--      

     trying to stay strong.     

            For her.            

      - Hey there, Maddie.      

    - Honey, this is the man    
 that I was telling you about.  

    - Can I shake your hand?    

         (eerie music)          

      - Well, if you guys       
        need a fill up,         

       just let me know.        

 - Thank you for that, Sweetie. 

    Oh, I'm so sorry, honey.    

       - You know, you're       
       kind of her hero.        

     - She's kind of mine.      

      I promise on my life      

that I will find the bad people 

      who did this to your      
   wonderful beautiful mommy.   

          It's my job,          

      to make sure little       
        girls don't cry.        

      You can count on me.      

             Okay?              

          I'm the axe,          

and they're the big bad wolves. 

     (creaking floorboards)     

         - Who is that?         

     Who the fuck is that?      

           (crashing)           

          (whistling)           

         - Here we go.          

        Ham and cheese.         

       - Mmm, extra mayo?       

  - Extra extra mayo, my dear.  

      Now, I have to dash,      

  but Thomas will be here if--  

             - No.              

 I'm turning in early tonight.  

           Hopefully.           

          - Oh, okay.           

  - [Charles] Down the hatch.   

      - Over the lips and       
       through the gums.        

         - Sleep well.          

        - Be a good boy.        

I'll be the very best, mother.

           (humming)            

What are you gonna do tonight?

         - Just drive.          

    We'll see what develops.    

[Thomas] You're not going to--

     - If the spirit moves      
    me, I shall allow it to.    

      - You remember that       
     cop from this morning?     

         - Who, Homer?          

 - He's supposed to be psychic. 

           (laughing)           

          - I knew it!          

   Something told me to keep    
    you away from his hand.     

         That's why his         
      drink had the glow.       

        - He's got a 98%        
  conviction record, Charles.   

            - Well.             

     All we can do is hope.     

            - What?             

     - That we fall within      
        that golden 2%.         

          - He knows.           

       I'm sure he knows.       

       - Thomas, psychic        
   intuition is not evidence.   

      Even if he's really       
       really good at it.       

          He may know,          

 but he still has to prove it.  

       We are above this,       

    and we always have been.    

          (chuckling)           

   (door opening and closing)   

         (door opening)         

Do you know where the keys are. 

           - Um, no.            

       How should I know?       

 - Thomas, are you lying to me? 

      - What do you say we      
    just stay home tonight,     

           get drunk,           

and watch some reality TV crap? 

Oh, but that's boring, Thomas.

         And if there's         
       one things I hate,       

         it's boredom.          

              Now-              

That bulge in your right pocket 

     wouldn't happen to be      
      the keys, would it?       

        (keys jingling)         

           Thank you.           

    What would I do without     
       you, big brother?        

          (whistling)           

         (door closing)         

     Well, hello gorgeous.      

         - Well, well.          

      Where's Tweedledum?       

        - He's at home.         

       He's a little shy.       

        Doesn't know how        
        to treat a lady.        

         - But you do?          

  - Only one way to find out.   

      (door creaking open)      

          (screaming)           

           (crashing)           

  (suspenseful dramatic music)  

       - Same room, huh?        

        Maybe you should        
     rent it by the month.      

     - It's not going to be     
   very clean after tonight.    

       - Things gonna get       
        dirty, are they?        

     - You could say that.      

            - Yeah?             

        You look like a         
       nasty little boy.        

     - I have no intention      
         of kissing you         

or the 1000 cocks you've sucked.

         - Well, fuck.          

        Tell me how you         
     really feel about me.      

    I'm gonna go freshen up.    

        - Take a shower.        

    With soap and hot water.    

    I want you to be clean.     

          Put this on.          

            You see,            

     I'm going to eat you,      

       from head to toe.        

        - Sounds like a         
     Saturday night to me.      

         (eerie music)          

         (gun cocking)          

  - Okay, you no-faced bitch.   

        Come and get me.        

       (heavy breathing)        

           Come out,            

           Come out,            

       Wherever you are.        

    (eerie suspenseful music    
      and heavy breathing)      

            Oh shit!            

            Oh fuck!            

           (crashing)           

(heavy breathing and struggling)

    (dramatic horror music)     

           Oh Jesus.            

        No, no, no, no.         

     No, no, no, Genevieve.     

            Please.             

           I'm sorry.           

     I'm so fucking sorry.      

         I'm so sorry.          

      No, no, no, no, no.       

    Please, please, please.     

           I'm sorry.           

     I'm so fucking sorry.      

            No, no.             

    Please, please, please.     

           No, fuck.            

             Sorry.             

           I'm sorry.           

     I'm so fucking sorry.      

          No, no, no.           

   (whimpering and trembling)   

 (screaming in pain and crying) 

           - Thomas!            

     - You see, my brother      
      and I have a theory.      

   We once saw a cat get run    
 over by a car when we were 6.  

    A week later the carcass    
   hadn't been picked up yet,   

but where it laid in the grass, 

       a patch of daisies       
        just sprung up.         

 That's where we first saw it.  

          - Saw what?           

The divine tragedies of life. 

      God's love in death.      

Beauty amongst ugliness and rot.

       - Are you a bible        
     thumper or something?      

             - No.              

         No, we haven't         
       written our bible.       

            Not yet.            

            But you.            

       You're very lucky.       

           - Oh yeah?           

          Why's that?           

    - You will be our second    
     step toward divinity.      

You see, when I said that I was 

        going to eat you        
       from head to toe,        

       I meant that I was       
    going to eat all of you.    

           Your skin.           

          Your heart.           

          Your liver.           

         Your pancreas.         

          Your spleen.          

         Your ovaries.          

        Your everything.        

    - What the fuck do you--    

    (screaming and crashing)    

          (screaming)           

            (crying)            

   (laughing and radio music)   

 - This is one of my favorites. 

      (alternative music)       

         I can kill you         
       first if you like,       

    but you have to promise     
     to be quiet, my dear.      

        Vanity, come on.        

          - Fuck you.           

 (spraying and dramatic music)  

     (screaming and crying)     

 - What did you do, you bitch?  

       You fucking bitch.       

         What the fuck?         

           (crashing)           

      (alternative music)       

        - What the hell?        

    (trembling and ripping)     

           Oh Jesus.            

       (heavy breathing)        

         What the hell?         

         (splattering)          

       Oh, Jesus Christ.        

          (screaming)           

         What the fuck?         

          (screaming)           

           Oh, Jesus.           

      (heaving breathing)       

           (coughing)           

          - Oh my God.          

           (coughing)           

  - So how long does something  
    like this usually take?     

        - Depends on how        
     willing the spirit is.     

    Sometimes a day or two,     

      sometimes instantly.      

       - [Swinberg] And,        
        what do you see?        

 Is it like pictures, or what?  

          - Anything.           

   Sometimes the last images,   

       sometimes bits and       
        pieces, voices,         

 and it completely takes me in. 

        I see all of it.        

        - And with her?         

          - With her--          

       (eerie soft music)       

       I'm with you now.        

           I'm here.            

          Talk to me.           

          Talk to me.           

       Did you know them.       

             Good.              

    That's good, sweetheart.    

      You have to tell me       
    their names, Genevieve.     

          Don't worry.          

  They can't hurt you anymore.  

 Talk to me, so I can make sure 
  they don't get away with it.  

     - They'll hurt Maddie.     

         - She's safe.          

        I sent her away         
       with your mother.        

      I won't let anything      
         happen to her.         

           I promise.           

    Now, talk to me, please.    

     (sharp dramatic music)     

      She's being stubborn      
     because she's scared.      

        But I know there        
       were two of them.        

    One did all the killing     
     and the other watched.     

       (eerie soft music)       

(suspenseful music and moaning) 

     - [Voiceover] Almost.      

        Yes, that's it.         

           (humming)            

     - Hi, how's it goin'?      

        - Shut up, bro.         

   (talking on movie screen)    

   (suspenseful horror music)   

(engine running and turning off)

        (keys jingling)         

      (car door shutting)       

   - Hey, hey, I caught you.    

       I tried the door,        
        no one answered.        

     Figured you were out,      
     figured I would wait.      

  Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, my   
   boy, what happened to you?   

       - I fell down the        
       stairs, Detective.       

         - It's Homer,          
      we're pals, please.       

       Does it hurt much.       

  My wife always says onion--   

  - How can I help you, Homer?  

    - Well, I wanted to ask     
    a few followup questions    

      if you have a spare       
        second or three.        

        - Alright, okay,        
       yeah, okay, sure.        

       Is this about the        
     whole waitress thing?      

          - Yeah, pal.          

     I'm afraid it's about      
   the whole waitress thing.    

           - Alright.           

       Here's your water.       

        - Oh, thank you.        

            - Yeah.             

  - So, where's your brother?   

    - He's around somewhere.    

I don't really keep tabs on him.

       - That's curious.        

       I figured you two        
     for being very close.      

        - Well, we are.         

            Sort of.            

           - Sort of?           

           Well now.            

       Probably off with        
        his girlfriend.         

       - Charles doesn't        
       have a girlfriend.       

         - He doesn't?          

        Well, no dancing        
       car for him then.        

     You're the lady killer     
      in the family, huh?       

   - I don't know about that.   

      I'd say Charles has       
      more to account for       

      in that department.       

    - So, both your dad and     
     Charles' dad are dead?     

          - Yes, sir.           

[Homer] Heart attack for one, 

       drunk driving for        
       the other, tragic.       

         - It happens.          

       - [Homer] It does.       

Doesn't make it any less tragic.

             Right?             

            - Right.            

             Yeah.              

         - Nice place.          

       Good use of space.       

          - Thank you.          

    - What do you call this     
     style of architecture?     

   - Oh, I don't really know.   

    I guess it would be a--     

         I don't know.          

   (eerie suspenseful music)    

 - So, where were you the night 

Genevieve Du Bois died, Thomas? 

             - Um.              

   What night was that again?   

       - Two nights ago.        

    - Oh, gee, let me think.    

     No, I can't remember.      

      - You know who I am.      

       - I looked you up.       

     - I figured you would.     

        So you know what        
        I can do, right?        

 You're not stupid, Mr. 160 IQ. 

       Best to be honest        
       with me, alright?        

         (eerie music)          

      - I know about the--      

    Charles took it, not me.    

      - I've got you, pal.      

     (eerie haunting music)     

      Let's make it easy.       

           (gun shot)           

           (groaning)           

             Shit!              

 I should've seen that coming.  

           - Mother?            

     - He talked too much.      

    - Mother, are you okay?     

            Come on.            

          You're okay.          

        Here's the bed.         

            Hop up.             

             Okay.              
             Okay.              

           (moaning)            

         Here you are.          

    Can I get you anything.     

          - I'm fine.           

     - If there's anything,     
        I'd be happy to.        

        - No, I'm fine.         

 - I just, I feel like I should 
    probably explain a few--    

      - Just send Charles       
      in when he arrives.       

     - Why do you hate me?      

 With every word you say to me, 

        you spit poison.        

   You hate my fucking guts.    

      - Thomas, language!       

       - I try to be the        
       good son for you,        

  but you always want Charles.  

          Why is that?          

           - Alright.           

            Alright.            

   Could you get mumsie some    
    of her medicine, please?    

      - Of course, mother.      

            Mother--            

            Can I--             

       Can we talk about        
      what just happened?       

 - Best to forget it, I think.  

       - There's a police       
   officer bleeding to death    

      in our living room,       

    we can't just forget it.    

     The thing is, mother,      

         Charles and I,         

              We--              

        killed someone.         

           - I know.            

          - You what?           

      - It's called guilt,      
         you big pussy.         

  That's what you're feeling.   

       And you wonder why       
        I favor Charles.        

         - He told you.         

     Charles, he told you?      

    - Of course he told me.     

         He told me the         
       night it happened.       

         Especially how         
       you started acting       

         like a colicky         
     little baby about it.      

        You're just like        
      your mewling father.      

            Useless.            

       If I hadn't killed       
        him when I did,         

    he would've impregnated     

     that stupid secretary      
        of his for sure,        

     spreading more of his      
      garbage seed around.      

 - What are you saying, mother? 

   - Your father was a drunk.   

      It was easy to fake.      

      And Charles' father       
      was a genius, but--       

        He couldn't fuck        
       to save his life.        

          - Oh my God.          

  - Do you know how easy it is  

to fake a heart attack, Thomas? 

  You could even pull it off.   

           - Mother?            

              Why?              

           - Because.           

They weren't worthy, that's why.

     I know the two of you      

   have been paying attention   
     to me over the years.      

          But somehow,          

       somehow I knew I'd       
       go wrong with you.       

   You had garbage genetics.    

     You've been my canker      
        sore ever since.        

            (crying)            

        - Jesus Christ.         

       - Oh, look at you.       

        Acting like one         
       of them even now.        

       You may have come        
        out of my cunt,         

    but you came out wrong.     

    - You killed my father?     

  - And I was happy to do it.   

       - But he loved me.       

       - Love isn't real.       

  Respect and fear, that's it.  

      Charles respects me       
      because he fears me.      

           But you--            

       You're different.        

   You're weak and powerless    

       and you yearn for        
    things that don't exist.    

       You may have acted       
     like Mr. Big and Bad,      

but when the world opened up and

     showed itself to you,      

   you shit your pants or ran   
    away like a little baby.    

          (sniffling)           

      You should just kill      
 yourself and be done with it.  

     Save us the trouble of     
    having to deal with you.    

   (eerie suspenseful music)    

            Oh good.            

  Shoot yourself in the head.   

       Pull a Hemingway.        

         Smartest thing         
       you could ever do.       

   I've been pushing Charles    
     for years to kill you,     

     but he wouldn't do it.     

          Damn idiot.           

    I should've aborted you     
     when I had the chance.     

           (laughing)           

        Really, Thomas?         

   You don't have the balls.    

   - You can't run away from    
     what you did, mother.      

   (talking on movie screen)    

        - Hey, fat guy.         

           (pounding)           

           Hold this.           

           Thank you.           

         (pounding and          
     dramatic horror music)     

         (eerie music)          

           (applause)           

          You like me.          

      You really like me.       

           (applause)           

   I want to thank my mother,   

          and Thomas,           

        and most of all,        

      I want to thank God.      

           Thank you.           

           Thank you.           

    (applause and cheering)     

           Goodnight!           

           (humming)            

       - Where were you?        

         - Where was I?         

    (dramatic horror music)     

           Oh, yeah.            

 I was turning water into wine. 

  - You're really the king of   
the fucking idiots, aren't you? 

           (giggling)           

  - It's nice to see you too.   

        - You framed it?        

            - Yeah.             

      I had to go to three      
     separate craft stores      

just to find the right size too.

     - And you told mother.     

What the hell were you thinking?

       - What did you do?       

            Mother?             

            Mother?             

            Mother?             

             Mommy?             

             Mommy?             

             Mommy?             

              No.               

        No, no, no, no.         

           (sobbing)            

        What did you do?        

           (gunshots)           

            (crying)            

  You didn't have to kill her.  

        - Don't you see         
      what she did to us?       

We're like this because of her. 

          - Like what?          

         - Delusional.          

             Crazy.             

      (suspenseful music)       

             - I'm              

             crazy.             

 (dramatic music and fighting)  

       She wasn't crazy.        

         You're crazy!          

         You're crazy!          

     You're the crazy one!      

     - What happened to us?     

 What the hell happened to us?  

         - Everything!          

      Everything happened       
         to us, Thomas!         

     We were made for this!     

     Because we're smarter.     

         We're better.          

     All this other garbage     
   and conventional thinking,   

       we're beyond that.       

       We have the look.        

          - What look?          

       - I have the look!       

     Jeffrey Dahmer had it.     

       Ted Bundy had it.        

       And now, I do too.       

    The look of a confident     
     and untouchable being.     

      We've touched hands       
    with the divine, Thomas.    

            Our eyes            

        have been opened        

            by God.             

        - We were wrong.        

   We were so fucking wrong.    

     - There is no regret.      

          Not for us.           

          Not anymore.          

       Once you're born,        

       you can't go back.       

 - Stop talking, you're crazy.  

     You don't get to talk.     

    (dramatic horror music)     

     - Where are you going?     

(fighting and suspenseful music)

      - Get off, Charles.       

   (struggling and fighting)    

    - You're telling on us?     

              Huh?              

       You're gonna tell        
      on us like a little       

    snot-nosed tattle tale?     

              Huh?              

    You big mongoloid baby.     

  I swear to God, I could just  
  kill you right now, Thomas.   

   (screaming and dial tone)    

            Thomas!             

        - [Thomas] Let's        
       turn ourselves in.       

      - Stop this, Thomas.      

 We can bury mother and go back 

    to the way things were.     

     Nothing has to change.     

      - We can't run away       
       from what we did.        

 They're waiting for our call.  

            - Don't.            

        - We can ask for        
        a cell together.        

         They should be         
       able to grant that       

        if we cooperate.        

       - [Charles] Don't        
       call them, Thomas.       

 - It'll be okay, baby brother. 

 - Thomas, put the phone down.  

   - They said they'd go easy   
     on us if we confessed.     

   Everybody makes mistakes.    

       - Thomas, put down       
       the fucking phone.       

      - Language, Charles.      

           (gun shot)           

            - Tommy?            

            Oh shit.            

            Oh shit.            

            Thomas?             

           Oh my God.           

             Tommy?             

      (crying and whimper)      

         Are you okay?          

       - I could use some       
   sunshine right about now.    

            - Okay.             

             Okay.              

       ¶ Sunshine, baby ¶       

       ¶ It's sunshine ¶        

   ¶ Time to wake up, baby ¶    

   ¶ Open those                 
pretty little eyes ¶

   ¶ All for you, sunshine ¶¶   

            (crying)            

      - I love that song.       

            (crying)            

            - What?             

     - It's okay, Charlie.      

         I can see her.         

           - See who?           

          - Genevieve.          

          She's there.          

         I can see her.         

   She says she forgives me.    

            (crying)            

            - Tommy?            

             Tommy?             

           Oh my God.           

            (crying)            

             Tommy!             

           (sobbing)            

         I'm so sorry.          

            (crying)            

     I don't know what the      
     fuck is wrong with me.     

           (sobbing)            

   I love you so much, Tommy.   

        Please don't go.        

        Please don't go.        

       - Sorry, Charles.        

           (sobbing)            

            Goodbye.            

     (soft acoustic music)      

        (police sirens)         

            - Fuck!             

  (heavy breathing and sirens)  

          (heavy rain)          

       ¶ This ordeal will       
        seal your fate ¶

       - It's over, pal.        

       You can come back        
        to reality now.         

      ¶ After the storm ¶
