You spent way too

We gotta fucking move.
Let's just go.

Put the gun down!
We don't have time.

[bandit 3] Fuck it!

[driver sobs]

[breathing heavily]

Fuck.

[siren wailing]

[officer 2] Internal Affairs will

Thank you.

What and where?

This one's dead,
the other one's inside.

Hey.

[paramedic 1] Hello, sir.
Sir, can you hear me?



I don't hear anything.
Must be the wind.

Lead the way.

It's the guy all shot up
inside. You can't miss him.

Officer, I can take it
from here. Thank you.

Sir, can you hear me?
Uh-huh.

Yeah? All right. [groans]

All right.


[paramedic 1] Prep the bus.
He's not gonna make it.

[groaning]
[paramedic 1] Come on.

Come on!

Oh, fuck!

What? What the fuck

Oh, where is she?
You're the detective. You tell me.

You're right. Once upon a time...

Once upon a time,
I had a husband

She isn't a child.

Just... You leave the bear.
I'll make sure she gets it.

Hey, don't worry about him.

If there's one thing that
he's good at, it's leaving.

[sirens wailing in distance]

[clears throat]

Thanks, everyone.

[clears throat]

"Out of the night
that covers me,

black is the pit
from pole to pole.

I thank whatever God may be

In the fell clutch

I have not winced

Under the bludgeonings

my head is bloody but unbowed.

Beyond this place

Good cops never die,

Rest in power.

[crowd applauding]

Next round is on me.

Thank you.

Whoo!

Uh, two Budweisers.



go, kid. Six bucks even.

Hey, asshole.

The man just saved a life.

He's earned a free one.

I hate this place.

It has its charms.

[cans hiss open]

Fifteen bucks. You said six.

Well, with the tequila it's 15.

What tequila?

I don't see any tequila.

Whatever.

Don't roofie my drink.


[toilet flushes]


me pulling swing all week.

Tell the union.
Hmm. I should.

You know... You know,
too many stupid people

around here at this time
doing stupid things.

Hey, give me the Fourth
over Halloween

and Christmas any day.

A couple of kids
shooting some fireworks?

No biggie for me.

You know, those fireworks
set off every single alarm

in Teslas and every single
building from here to Anaheim.

It actually makes me
miss New York.

And you're gonna have to deal
with so many bullshit phone calls.

Yo, Justin Bieber!

You eavesdropping right now?


My name is Dezi. I...

We don't give a fuck.

This is a cop bar.

What kind of badge is it?

EMT?


You think that means something?

Yeah, so, uh,

I just have to save
your sorry asses,

but I can't have a beer
with you?

to make it as a doctor.

Look, I've got a lot of respect

for my, uh, blue-blooded
brothers, right?

My mother was a guard.

mother was a guard?

And you're bragging about that?


They're like the Irish us.

Are you Irish, huh?

Uh... [chuckles]

I hear that, uh, Irish
girls are very easy.


You must have shit for brains
to step in front of me like this.

Okay. You're gonna have to go.

Well, I thought this was the land of the free.
It ain't for you.

Yeah. All right. I think I'll
finish my beer. Thank you.

Oh, great. There's a baseball bat?

Get the fuck out of here.
[Dezi] What is this, like a softball league?

You're gonna have to
go. What's going on?

You wanna go?
Sign me up. I'm down.

Give me
the fucking baseball bat.

["Closer" plays]

â™ª <i>You can also get closer</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Yeah, closer</i> â™ª

[Dezi groans]

â™ª <i>Come on, closer</i> â™ª



[shouts, coughs]


let's go. He's not worth it.

â™ª <i>So are you ready</i>
<i>For it, child?</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>True power</i>
<i>I know is getting over</i> â™ª


â™ª <i>Time to beat it up</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I know I'm too damn naive</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>You've seen</i>
<i>That she walked in</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Come on So get closer</i> â™ª


[sighs, chuckles]

I love this country.

I love it. Let's go.

Someone call the police. Mmm.

[electronic music playing]

[music continues
on speakers nearby]



Why do you live
in this shithole?

Well, you find me a cheaper
place, and I'll live there.

Any breaks?


[clears throat]

Shit.

We're on deck in 50.

"Oh, we're on deck in 50."

You like my accent? [chuckles]

It's about as good as you look.


No, no, no, no. Dez...


This is the worst idea.

You think too much.

start a fight in a cop bar?

They're never gonna
let us back in there.

Mmm.

I want an answer.

Maybe 'cause I almost was one.

One of what?

I always wanted to be a cop.

Bullshit.

No lie.

Nearly broke my dad's heart.

Not exactly
a law-abiding citizen.

And what happened?

Well... [chuckles]

I, uh,

didn't exactly make it through
the department interview.

Mmm. Yeah, they
said my moral compass

was skewed or whatever.

You?

Yeah, I was this close, but...

Yeah, I still wanted to
do some good, you know?

EMT life, baby.

[both laugh]

Probably doing more good
than those assholes, anyway.

There are some good cops.
Like, most are good.

Oh yeah? Well, you'll have
to introduce me to one.


I, uh, think I started
that fight.

Well, first of all,
I didn't start the fight.

Mmm. Okay. I was defending
myself, which is a big difference.

Sure.

I don't know.
I guess I just wanted to see

how tough the LAPD
really was, you know?

You're crazy.

Oh, and you're adorable.

[slaps]
Don't call me that.

Ever.

Yes, ma'am.


a one-time thing.

Oh, okay. It's a one-time thing

and then it's a...
Until it's a two-time thing.

And then it's
a three-time thing, okay?

And then it's a four-time thing.

You think you're so charming.

[sirens wailing]

[tires screech]

Narcan. Stay with us.

[patient coughing]


[coughing, retching]

[chattering on radio]

[siren wailing]
[inaudible dialogue]


[breathing heavily]

[chattering on radio]

[footsteps approach]

Did Kyle shove you?

What did I say?

If someone shoves you,
you punch 'em.

If they pull a knife,
you pull a gun.

If they bring a tank,
call me. All right?

Kyle. Get over here.

Get up.

You've been pushing him
around again?

Milton, you know what to do.

Go on.

Shake hands.

All good?

Go on.

What did I say to you
about slouching?

Easy on the spread,
it has to last a month.


You know, your mother would turn
in her grave if she saw the world now.

This isn't the country
it once was.

Small miracles,
that's all we can hope for.

You know, every gang
in Long Beach is trying

to get their hands
on those kids.

We feed them,
get tutors for them.

This shelter,

it's a legacy.

As long as it stays open,
her memory will last.

Mom would be proud of you, Dad.

Yeah, well, pride isn't a luxury
I... I can afford, you know?

Takes all my strength
to keep the lights on here.

We've been defunded.

Yeah. Budget cuts,

that's what they say,
because of the riots last year.

The state doesn't get it,
you know?

Save a kid, you save the future.

[door closes]

Anyway,
I got to get to business.

Um, do you want me
to tell the kids

the youth center's closed?
No.

[clears throat] I invited them.

They're gonna help with
creative ways to keep the lights on.

Come on, buddy.

<i>Everything in your life</i>

<i>has been leading up
to this moment.</i>

It's the opinion
of the department

that why someone enters
law enforcement

is as important as the work
they do on a daily basis.

Why do I wanna be a cop?

I like doughnuts.

Gun fights.

Car chases.
Okay, okay.

This isn't your
first time in here.

That's right.

But this is a safe space.

<i>You were given a second chance
after New York,</i>

<i>and we need to make sure you
don't slip into your old cowboy ways.</i>

I can't tell your captain that
you're safe to go back on the streets

unless I know you're not a
danger to yourself or others,

that's bottom line.

Look, I gave my statement.

It was a good shooting.

I feel better.

<i>Tell me the truth.</i>

<i>Why do you wanna be a cop?</i>

daughter to be safe.

To be proud of me.

Now your father, he was
a bank manager in Newark.

<i>Can you just tell me
a little bit about him?</i>

He was shot during an
attempted robbery, is that right?


We're done.

[sirens wailing]

[chattering on radio]

[dispatcher on radio] <i>Dezi? Dezi?
Report to the supervisor office.</i>

Boss?

Dezi, take a seat.

I got a witness from
the Beston Bank robbery

that says you refused
to offer medical assistance.

Triage.

This isn't a war zone.

Would you rather me save
the villain or the victim?

I read your report.

Yes. We arrived
on the scene, right?

We went past the dead cop.

I made a judgment call, and then
we went into the manager's office.

You broke protocol
carrying him out like that.

I saved the guy's life.

He's suing the city and you
for emotional trauma

sustained during
emergency transportation.

[screams]
Get the fuck out of here.


You're suspended.
What?

Dezi. I did nothing wrong.

Take a few weeks.

Let legal come to a resolution,

it'll blow over.
[breathing heavily]

That's not fucking fair!

You think you can talk
to me like this?

Fuck it.

You're fired for insubordination

and refusing to offer medical
assistance to someone in need.

You can't fire me. Your
contract is terminated now.

You can't fire me, because I'm the
best fucking para you fucking got.

You fire me, and you hurt
the whole fucking city.

Big fucking whoop.

Get out of my office.

<i>The world needs heroes.</i>

<i>Fact: Cops have
the hardest job in the world.</i>

<i>Fact: This city

<i>We need cops who

<i>Who don't care

<i>Defund the police?</i>

<i>Right, yeah, sure, great idea.</i>

<i>Defund the police, and then

<i>When you can't even get a cup

<i>You will never see all the

<i>You will never see them breaking

[elevator bell dings]

[elevator bell dings]


What have you got going on
the morning of the Fourth?

I'm headed to the beach
with my girl, sir.

I've been looking forward
to it all week.

We're looking for volunteers
for the At-Risk Shelter.

Setting up, you know food,
cleaning, you know. Yeah.

I can't force you to say yes.

But I can tell the sergeant
that you declined.

I would love to, but we've
been planning this for a month.

I got to pick her mom up
at the airport.

Fine. Give it to me.

Serve and protect.

this is me serving.

I'm gonna need you to protect me

from my girlfriend.

Thank you.

You think I'm kidding.

[podcast host] <i>But I ask this,</i>
"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"

<i>Who watches the watchers?</i>

<i>Answer:</i>

<i>Too many people.</i>

<i>Police can't effectively uh,</i>

<i>do their job
with this level of scrutiny</i>

<i>from the media
and, uh, the public.</i>

<i>I say cops don't do enough.</i>

<i>They need a ghost, someone
that can take out the trash</i>

<i>and doesn't have to worry
about the red tape.</i>

<i>I'm not talking about,
uh, a vigilante.</i>

<i>I'm talking more of a...</i>

<i>Angel of Justice.</i>

[phone ringing]

[ringing continues]

Knight! My office, now.

Hey, boss. Shut up.

Yes, ma'am.

What are you working? Paperwork.

No thanks to you.

Good. Here's some more.

Someone stole a uniform,
badge, gun...

The whole shebang...
From the coroner's office

down at North Roads Hospital.

Family wants the badge back.

IA wants the gun
and I want to know

what kind of degenerate
would do such a thing.

No security cameras?
Nope, no.

Privacy reasons. Privacy?

The customers are dead.

That means you're gonna have
to do a little leg work.

And by the looks of things, you could
do with getting in some more steps.

Ouch.

Just calling it like I see it.

You sleeping all right?

Ah, thank you for noticing.

It was a late night.

Narcotics Unit intercepted

a couple of tons of coke
and some women.

Cartel shit?
Oh, they wish.

No, it was the Vampos Gang.

I guess all the names
were... were taken.

Oh hey, congrats on the divorce.

I'm a free man. Yeah, well,
uh, your ring finger may be free,

but your ass still belongs
to the department.

Mmm.

Don't I know it.

How's your daughter?

She's fine. Uh...

Fine is not the F word
I would use

to describe your daughter.

But then again hey, I mean
she's got a dad like you

and a mom like Camilla.

A shrink could diagnose those
daddy issues three states away.

Did somebody piss
in your coffee?


that there's a way to balance
out work and home life.

How many husbands have you had? I
didn't say I knew how to balance it out.

I'm just saying there is a way.

You know, I mean look at Fitz.

Fitz is a good boy.

He's whipped.

That is true.

He's a good cop though.

What makes you say that?

There's none finer.

No, I'm... I'm curious now.

What do you think makes
a good cop?

A good cop doesn't sleep well,
so everyone else can.

I'll accept that.

Oh, ah, one last thing.

You and Fitz are working
the Fourth.

I'm going camping.

Camping?

Yeah. I got a cabin.

Uh, that's not camping.

Not unless I get time off.

The Fourth?

That's my favorite day.

And I expect you
to protect and serve

with a smile on your face.

Thank you, Knight.

Your future is safe. I bank here.

Set up an account so we can get
you some nice compound interest

or maybe an investment account
would be better for you.

How much do you... Investment
account? Okay, that's fine.

Officer. What can I do for you?


Are you here to do a 6-8-9?

Yes. Yeah.

Miss Gakowski.

The officer... [groans]

...wants to do a 6-8-9.

Are you okay, Officer?

Your uniform looks
kind of wonky.

Call the union. The department
should not be sending you out like that.

Do I know you? Were you here
that night those tweaker assholes

made a run at my vault?

Yeah. I mean,
I... I heard about that.

cooked, but you boys saved my life.

I'm sure those paramedics
did a good job, too.

It was the blue bloods and
the doctors at Saint Mary's.

They're the heroes.

Are you part of the 14th?

I have a guy whose father
used to be the night commander.

James Jayne?

Oh, yeah, sure.

You know him?

Yeah.

Good man.

I thought he died.

Well, you know...

cops never die.

Amen, brother.

Blue lives never die.

Thank you for what you do.

So, do you have any plans
for the Fourth?

Ah, you know, uh, the usual.

Ah, yeah, work never ceases.

I can relate. I will
be here toiling away.

But I love it.

There's nothing more American

than making money on the Fourth.


Come on. Sir.

[hydraulics hum]


Yeah.


<i>Takes all my strength
to keep the lights on here.</i>

Go, go, go.

[bandit 1] Everybody down! Down
on the ground! [customers screaming]

Get down! [customer] Oh, my God!

You, back to the register right now!
William, hang... hang on.

Let's go, let's go!

[bandits shouting]

Let's go! Empty the register!

[bandit 2] Fucking vault's
open. I'm going for it.

[bandit 1 shouting]

Stay down!

[breathing heavily]

Let's go. Stay on the
ground. You, against the wall!

Get your head down!

Let's go.
Stay on the fucking ground!

Shit! Ah! Fuck!
[bandit 3] You all right?

[bandit 1] I said no vault!

Look at all this fucking cash!

I'm fucking shot, dude.

Well, then hurry
the fuck up and help me.

[bandit 1] Fuck you! You
greedy fuck, get the money!

[bandit 2] You wanna fucking get out
of here, get the fucking money. Fuck!

[bandit 3] Don't fucking
move. No cell phones, nothing.

Nobody move. I'll take
that. Thank you very much.

[bandit 2] Fuck it. Let's go, you cry baby.
[bandit 1] Goddamn it!

Damn. [customer screams]

[bandit 2] Stay down!

This shelter, it's a legacy.

As long as it stays open,
her memory will last.

All clear.

Good man.

[birds chirping]


Officer! Officer,
please, you have to help me!

You have to help me. Um...

You have to help me.
Please, my husband. He's...

No, I'm not a, uh... Officer!

No, I'm off-duty.

What? What kind of cop are you?

Okay, I need you to...
I need you to calm down.

Huh?

Um...

Okay, look,
I need you to calm down.

Okay?

Where is he? He's over here.

Okay.

He's here. He's over here.

They're over there. Over here.

[husband groans]
[mugger 1] You're weak...

Hands up!

Yeah, hands!


Go.

Get out of here!

Now, hands against the wall.

Now!

All right.

Now, spread 'em.

All right,
now you all have the right

to remain silent.


And anything...

What's this?

This? Huh?


...you say
will be used against you

in the court of law. [grunts]

[mugger 2] That's it. Kick his ass.
[mugger 3] Yeah, kick his ass.


No.

No, no.

Uh, all right.

Oh, no.

[breathing heavily]

This is what happens
when you do not show respect.

I am an officer of the law.

Okay, get on your knees.

Get on your knees
and kiss the ground!

Kiss the ground.

Kiss it!

Comply and you'll survive.

Okay.

No.

I mean, answer me this.

You guys think the world
would be a better place

without you in it?

Huh?

I mean, what do you do?

No, man. No. No.

better than it was yesterday.

I got your answer right here.


<i>If they had had complied,
they would have been alive.</i>

[Dezi breathing heavily]


[knocking continues]

Hello?

Who is it?

You won't believe
the day I fucking had.

What happened?

Some guy dressed up as a cop

shot four guys in Van Nuys.

Not one made it.

Did they find the shooter?

Not yet. But they will.

I mean,
guy was dressed up as a cop

acting like
he was gonna arrest them.

The police don't know shit
about his motive.

Damn.

It isn't fair.

Well, maybe it'll keep
the cops on their toes.

Shake things up a bit.

Don't say that, man.

Why?

Oh, you think they care
about us?

The sons pay for the
sins of their fathers.

Nothing's changed.

Okay?

My father taught me that.

I remember the day that I
told him I wanted to be a cop.

And he gave me the
biggest backhand of my life,

and knocked me down
on the floor.


Told me the cops
are our enemies.

And, uh, you know,
they're just pigs.

Descendants from slave owners
who prosecuted runaway slaves.

Like the War of Independence,
uh, that's for this country's taxes

and the American Civil War,
well, that's like,

you know, they freed the
slaves, but no one's really free.

We're not free.

We... We'll never be free.

Doesn't matter who we are, they'll sell
us the same fucking American dream.

And it's sad. It... It's so sad.

It's just...

It's about money.

And guys like,
what, Sean Beston?

<i>You know, he's... he's
just a... He's a slave owner.</i>

And the cops?

His goons.

I'm sorry you feel that way.

Yeah.

It is what it is.

I... I thought I got over
this a long time ago.

See you.


[horn honks]

where's the fucking money?

Who's this guy? Didn't
know he's a fucking cop.

No son of mine is a cop.

What the fuck you wearing, son?

It's not the uniform
that makes the man.

The man that makes his own luck.

Don't throw my fucking
words back in my face.

Halloween is next October.

You can dress up then.

You want to help?

Start with meal prep.

Well...

we can change the world.

I mean, cops, they lock
up kids every day, but this?

This is real.

This shelter stops kids
from becoming these two.

This is our chance.

How long before the, uh...

The lights go out
in this place for good?

Where there's a will,
there's a way.

I'm talking about real action.

You know? A real way
to make change.

Maybe your new associates
can help.

Go on.

Beston Bank and Trust.

What about it?

Their security system,
it's all over the place.

The guards, they're arrogant.

I... I can get us in.

So?

We hit it.

When you look outside,

I mean, do you see
the American dream,

or do you see someone else's?

Embarrass the city
and make some cheese?

I can fuck with that.

We live in a society
where there is nothing

more American than making money

on the Fourth of July.

Could you be positive for once?

Hey, I'm a fountain of
good vibes, brother Knight.

If it isn't dumb and dumber.
Barney Rubble and this caveman.

What's his name again?

Can't believe you forgot
Fred's name.

Come on, we're on soft duty.

That isn't real.
Ah, soft duty is one beer above hard duty,

and three below "let's party."

Fucking degenerates.

One of you should be in jail,

and the other in the chair.

Have you got a problem?

If I did, what would you do?

Happy Fourth.

Yeah.

Thank you, douche bags.


Shit!

I'll meet you in the car.

[clears throat]
All right, let's do this.

You ready?

You lucky son of a bitch.

One time I'd rather
still be in the chair.

Hey!

You guys know you're going
to jail

for the rest
of your lives, right?

Well, I...

All right, I'm just playing.

All right, what do you got here?

What is that, a Roman candle?

Let me see that thing.

Listen, if you guys are
gonna light these off...

[lighter flicks] ...you
gotta be safe about it.

[fuse ignites] - Because you
could do some real damage

with one of these things.
You understand?

I want you to point 'em
in the air.

Not at people, not at
animals, not at dogs.

You understand? If I see
you pointing this at a dog,

I'm gonna curb stomp you
in front of your grandmother.

Do you understand?
All right, good.

[fireworks launching]

[cell phone buzzing]
[guests chattering]

Oh. Mmm.



whenever she's ready to talk to you.

Just want to make sure
that she's okay.

<i>Just tell me where she's living.</i>

She's got a boyfriend. I...

What? Who?

go all super-dad now.

If not now, when?

How's the new guy?

You don't get
to ask questions like that.


You can do better.

<i>If he treats you right,
I'll support that.</i>

All I want is for you and
our girl to be happy and safe.

That's all.

Do you think we, uh,
could have, uh, ever worked?

You put the job first.

And I'm not blaming you,
I'm not.

Just the hours.

It was no way to raise a family.

Yeah.

Yeah, the same iceberg.

<i>Hey, did you give her the bear?</i>

When I see her, I will.

Happy Fourth, Detective.

Hey, honey. [Ally] Hi.

[cell phone buzzing]


Dad's been trying
to get a hold of you.

Why?

He's your father.

And fathers do care about
the well-being of their children.

Occasionally.

He's sorry he missed
your birthday.

Yeah, and didn't he get me
this exact same one last year?

You're his little princess.

Whatever. [chuckles]

Thank you.

[clears throat] Okay. Oh.

You are your father's child.

Mm-hmm. You happy now?

Yeah, three more of those
and I will be.

Mm-hmm. And nice
of you to dress up, too.

I'm on call.

Wanna do shots?


These are Mike's work friends.

Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

We wouldn't want
to embarrass him.

Mm-mmm.

Okay.

To being a problem child.

Oh, no.

To good parenting.



Mm-mmm, mm-mmm. Oh.

Oh. Why did you make me do that?

That's so good. No.

Yeah. No.

Go, Mom. Go, Mom.

Yeah! [chuckles]

[mouthing words]

Happy Fourth, Officer.
Happy Fourth.

Indeed.
What can I do for you?

I'm here to do a 6-8-9.

Well, we've never been better.

Well, I, um...

I'm just here
to check up on you, sir.

Well, that's very kind of you.
But all is well. All is well.

You'd be doing me a favor if you
let me inside, so I can see for myself.

What are you doing? Oh,
you! Hey, there's two back there!

Fucker... [shouting]
Want to let me inside?


Stay back, you motherfuckers!





Open it up.

Open up! Open it up!

I am about to live
my American dream.

Mr. Beston,
please stay where you are.

Guards, put down your guns.
You're free to go.


[Beston yelps]


You're fucking crazy.


Tell me who I am.

<i>Tell me who I am.</i>

I said, let her go.

It wasn't supposed

I gave everything I had
to this country.

I tried playing by the rules,

and look where
it fucking got me.

You think that?

You're brainwashed if
you think I'm the bad guy.

[siren wailing]

They don't pay me to judge.

No. You're just a sicario
with a badge.

You shoot anyone
they tell you to.

The government...

The government is the
biggest gang in town.

Put the gun down.

I would've been the best cop
this city has ever had.

You've got no right
to wear that uniform.


The badge, it doesn't...

It doesn't make the man.

You don't think
I could've been a good cop,

if I just had a fucking chance?

There's no cure
for being an asshole.

All I wanted
was to be the good guy.

That's it.

We play the cards we're dealt.

Sometimes we win,
and sometimes we bite it.

Fuck you.





I got you. Ally! Please!

Tell them
I'm a good guy. Tell them.

Ally!

It's okay.

I'm not gonna shoot.
I'm the good guy.

I'm the good guy.

I'm the good...
