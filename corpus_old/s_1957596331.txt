Is that what your wings
look like?

NIKKI: A little bit, yeah.

We'll hang it up, huh?

We'll put it in a special spot.

Where?

Do you see the one

LITTLE: Mmhmm.

NIKKI: Right next to that.

but with feathers, sparkles,
and... and big, you know?

NIKKI: How big you think
they'll be, huh?

Is that one wing or two wings?

LITTLE: Two wings.

Huh, that's two wings like that?

That's not big at all.

How're you gonna fly around

That's what I'm tryin' to do.

Are we gonna go to topside now?

No, we're

Everybody else can do

So, we don't gotta listen

when we talk about this, okay?

It's only me and you.

We're gonna do
whatever we need to do

and what we gotta do right now
is we just gotta wait,

'cause that's the only way
it's gonna be safe, okay?

Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, okay?

So they
ain't gonna fall down here.

Most of the time
they're stuck up in the sky.

Hmm.

When they do fall,
they fall really fast.

Like fire across the whole sky.

And then they're dead.

How?

How... how does the star
look like when they fire?

It's like um, a big streak.

Jesus Christ.

Why can't I speak to her, huh?

NIKKI: Just... just

Oh, is she deaf? I got it.

It's all good. I can speak deaf.

Come here, kid.

FAKER: [indistinct speech]

LES: She'll fuck you up, man.

Yo, you get down on this shit

NIKKI: No, I don't want it, Les.

Oh, what do you mean?
You just said you wanted some.

NIKKI: I just forgot.

NIKKI: Hey, you can eat this.

You wanna try some? Hmm?

FAKER: No!

JUNKEE: How much? How much?

LES: You owe me 20,

There you go.

That's it. That's what you

You can't see those stars

What you mean?

Those are dead stars.

LES: The hell

The lights?

Yeah, I know the lights

You know
why you can't see the stars?

You see them buildings?

All the lights
from the buildings,

they outshine the stars right,
so...

but you know... you know
that they're still there.

They're up there.

How come I never saw you before?

Only mama goes top side.

LES: Why not you?

'Cause I get hurt.

LES: Oh yeah?

LITTLE: 'Cause I don't got
my wings.

Ah!

Did your mama have her wings?

Yes.

LES: Where does
she keep her wings?

She keeps them in her back,
folded.

LES: Oh, she folds them up.

I got wings. You see my wings?

Check these out.

Look at that.

When you're gonna get your ones?

Hmm. Soon.

Oh yeah?

LES: What happened?

What is this?
LES: What's up?

Can you please take her out?

She wanted to see her mama.

NIKKI: Hey, Baby, you okay?
We got a half hour

and then it's back-to-back
till you're done...

I got sweat.
So, we should do this shit now.

NIKKI: I don't know
why the fuck she's in here?

LES: Why... she...
she missed her mama.

You don't wanna see your girl?

NIKKI: I specifically told you
to keep her out of here.

LES: She misses you, you know?

NIKKI: You're okay, Baby,
it's okay.

LES: Listen, I was done with you
after that shit you pulled,

but you're too good
for business.

Your mama, she's my best girl.

Long as she keep her mouth shut.

Hey, just lay down, Baby,
just lay down.

Well, you ain't gonna say
"thanks"?

There you go.
Just give me a second.

LES: Come on,
that ain't the Nikki I know.

You know, I... I... maybe
I was harsh before, you know?

Maybe uh, I wasn't being fair,
so I don't wanna do this shit.

We're gonna do it right,
we're gonna do a 70-30.

Like I said in the beginning,

I ain't gonna fuck with you
like that, right?

You know, you deserve it,
you've been workin' hard.

[lighter flicking]
LES: You do it proper.

You know what else?
You stay here tonight.

Your girl, too.
You ain't gotta pay for her.

I mean, with me,
you got all the shit you need,

you know that?

It could be like that.
I'm tryin' to...

NIKKI: What are you...
what are you talking about?

What do you want?
LES: I'm... I want nothing.

I'm just saying that you know,

I want you to stay here,
you know?

You came here, 'cause you needed
a place to stay,

so I want you to stay here.

I wanna take care of you,
it's what I do.

And your girl, too, you know?

Your girl, too,
she stays here till you...

Till you figure your shit out.

All right, yo, tie up, come on.

Oh, what the fuck?

No, we... we got a place to stay.

LES: Oh, why you lyin'?
We got a place to stay.

LES: No, you're fuckin' lying!

Why you doin' that shit?
Come on.

Don't do...
don't be like that to me.

I'm a good guy right? Right?

We've been havin' a good time.
Right, girlie?

Hey, don't touch her.

LES: I'ma take care of you.
Just... right.

Right? You know that.
NIKKI: I know.

NIKKI: I mean like...
You know that. Yeah.

NIKKI: I'm working for you.
That's it, okay?

LES: So what?
Just... you don't...

I don't want?
NIKKI: Ne... you don't need...

I don't what?

NIKKI: You don't need
to bring her into this.

LES: Yeah, if you want...
you want to talk about this,

we're talkin' about this
right now.

Look, these guys,
they're gonna take care of her.

They'll barely touch her,
none of that shit.

But this could be
thousands of dollars.

This could be crazy, though,
for you and me, all right?

You know how rare shit is?

A kid like this
that's this fuckin' chill?

You know how much money
they'll pay for that?

You... you just put her in a room
with them for a little bit.

Stop.
LES: Huh?

NIKKI: No.
LES: Just listen to me.

NIKKI: No, shut up.
Just listen to me.

NIKKI: Shut up.
No. Gee, no!

LES: You're still workin' for me
for another three fuckin' hours!

So, you shut the fuck up
and listen!

I'll call the fucking cops
right now! Huh?

I can rip this kid right out
of your junky ass hands.

Tell 'em that you've been
keeping her in the tunnels

in the fucking dark
like she don't exist.

And then what? You in prison

and she's in the fuckin' system
the rest of her life?

You want that shit?
Where you goin', huh?

Where are you goin'?
Les, I'm gonna fuckin' scream.

I think you need to sit down
and do some of this shit.

You ain't thinkin' straight.
NIKKI: I don't need your shit.

LITTLE: Mama.
NIKKI: I don't need your dope.

Yo.

I need you
to get the fuck out of my way.

You need to fuckin' lie down.

Come on, lay down.

What are you doing?

Nikki, come on.

NIKKI: Back down, baby,
just go over there.

LES: Hey, oh. Hey, look here.

None of this is for free,
all right?

I'm tryin' to help you out,
I'm tryin' to get you paid,

I'm tryin'
to get you some fuckin' money,

so you can
get the fuck out of here.

You know,
I have to do this first.

NIKKI: Let's go.

Come on, where is it?
You want?

NIKKI: I want it.
LES: You wanna do this?

Yeah, I wanna do it.

Don't worry. Here you go.

You're just gonna keep this

LITTLE: Okay.

NIKKI: I just gotta go

Hello? Hello?

Oh, sorry, I...
I left my phone in here earlier.

I just didn't...
I didn't see anybody.

Oh!

NIKKI: Sorry,
I didn't wanna bother anyone.

We were here earlier,
we just came up for...

JOHN: No, no, it... it's...
it's okay.

I can... we... oh,
I can check downstairs,

see if someone's turned it in.

Eric,
I'm missing a phone in here.

JUNKEE: What? Wh...
what kind of phone was it?

NIKKI: It's not a big deal.

I'm... I'm sure
I just left it somewhere else.

I don't know...
NIKKI: It's fine.

Listen, why don't we uh,
have you right down uh...

Well, we're shuttin' down.

NIKKI: No, it's just a...
it's just an old phone.

Hey guys, are you hungry?

I have a plate of food for you
if you want?

Yeah? Yeah, okay.

That way
we can get it back to you.

Thank you.

ERIC: Vi, I gotta lock it down,
I gotta head home.

VI: All right, Eric, all right.

VI: Yeah, okay, go.
WOMAN 1: Here you go, Honey.

NIKKI: It's... it's fine.

I probably
just left it somewhere.

WOMAN 1: Here you go, Honey.

Hey, enjoy. Stay warm, okay?
Okay, thank you.

WOMAN 1: Bye-bye.
VI: [Overlapping speech]

Um, I... I was just wondering
if you had any beds to stay.

For the night.

To sleep?

Yeah, I... just tonight.

VI: You don't have a place
to stay?

NIKKI: Uh, no, we do.

We're staying in Staten Island
at the Elizabeth Coalition.

Um, it's just really far

and some of the trains
are shut down now,

so it's gonna be tough
to get over there.

Just thought it would be easier,
because um...

VI: We don't have beds here,
Sweetie.

Uh... um...

We... we... we've just been
walkin' around all day.

I just thought
it would just really help us out

if... if...
if that was something that...

Hey, you don't...
you don't have to call anyone.

No, no, no, no, I'm...
it's just a hotline.

No, I... I'm fine. I was j...

They will be able
to help you out here.

NIKKI: No, I was just...
I was just...

We're at... [Overlapping speech]
Oh, Sweetie, it's not...

I... I...
we were on that platform.

We were on... I was on the train
and the doors closed.

Did you see her, did you...

Wait, hold on,
you lost somebody?

I'm asking
if you saw a little girl.

You would have seen her!
What is her name?

You would have seen her
come up here.

Did you see her?
a little girl by herself.

No, look...
She would have come up here.

She's not there. You...
You need to calm down.

Miss, I'm not gonna talk to you
if you continue to scream at me.

[Nikki grunting]
Miss?

What's her name, miss?
Little.

What's she wearin'?

I d... I... I don't know.

She's in a green... I...
I put my green coat on her.

It's my coat with
um, brown boats on...

And like a blue hood.

All right, just calm down.
Calm down.

The number,
I'm tryin' to help you.

Who are you on the phone with?

Who are you on the phone with?
ATTENDANT: Calm down.

Yeah, I'm down here
with someone...

Miss!

[Nikki grunting]
MAN: No, no, miss! You okay?

Like some hours.

How long ago?
Hours!

You gotta let go of me!
You gotta let go.

She belongs with me, okay?

Well, she is there.
I know she's there.

Stop it.

then sh... sh... she.

No, I got it, no.

already, you know that.

No, they haven't.

JOHN: Nikki, Nikki, Nikki.
I... you don't understand.

Okay!
NIKKI: She's hi...

Listen!
She's hiding from me. I...

Somebody found her
long time ago.

She's gone.
I'm gonna bring her home.

Don't you fuck me.
JOHN: No, no. It doesn't...

JOHN: You've lost her, okay?
Please.

JOHN: They're not gonna give
her back to you.

[breathes heavily]

Somebody found her already!

You understand?
I am her home.

I'm gonna find her
and I'm gonna bring her home...

She doesn't have a fuckin' home!

She never had a home here.

All right?

She has a chance now.

It's over.

Nikki.

Do whatever you want.
