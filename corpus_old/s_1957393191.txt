[music playing]

[heavy breathing]

Oh, God!

Oh my God, what was that?

JOHNNY: What?

Johnny!

Some-- somebody's at the window.

JOHNNY: I don't hear anything.

Johnny, somebody's watching us.

Johnny!

[door slamming]


Somebody's watching us!

Johnny, go check.

Porn magazine number 187.

Homo.

Name-- "Mission Impenetrable."

Page 37.

So No, I honestly don't
think I'm aroused by this.

OK, no substantial arousal.

OK.

Page 84.

[music playing]

Something smells like salami!

OK, here it comes!

OK, oh, Johnny, kiss me.

Oh, shit, I think
I singed my cornea!

Oh, je-- I gotta
get out of the way.

No don't do that!

I don't want my
parents to see these.

Oh shit!
Ow!

-Ooh, ow, ow!
-There's no warning.

OK, let's change--

Oh!

Come on, let's go.

OK.

Oh shit, oh, Jesus, OK, that's
it, show's over, let's get--

Oh, shit!

Ow!

I can't see.

I'm seeing spots.

Are you seeing spots?

Hey, do you see
Murray anywhere?

No, look, there's a booth.

Here it is.

Oh, my-- Put it there, Murray.

Congratulations.

What about the label?

OK.

I talked to the label.

They said they don't
need to see you perform.

The demo was enough.


So how long?

How long do you think it'll be?

Well, their lawyers
are looking over

the memo I drew up specifying
the deal and your advance.

They'll make suggestions, we'll
make changes, then you'll sign.

That's great!

That's incredible!

But how long?

How long do you think?

OK.

I know you're excited.

But you don't mess around
with a major record label.

These guys are real sticklers.

I'd say we're looking at a week.

That's great!

Good work, Murray!

Good work.

Here's to us.

Here's to us.

Here's to us.

So, I'll call my brother
first in the morning.

Borrow his van, have you moved
in first thing Sunday morning.

All right?

All right.

[door opening]

Oh, fuck you!

Ah, more wine.

What a surprise.

Fuck you, you fucker!

Ah, a new vocabulary word.

Where'd you get your
education, K-Mart?

[music playing]

I can't believe you
asked her to move in.

What were you thinking?

We've been together six months.

You told me the relationship
wasn't going anywhere.

I don't think of it
as going anywhere.

It's just moving a few blocks.

I don't want to say you're
making a big mistake.

But you're making
a big mistake here.

I mean, it's all
going to go downhill.

You have the sex--
you're going to start

shopping for preschools soon.

Look, I have finally got
my entire life in order.

My album's out, I'm going to
be signed to a major label

within a week, Murray's
putting a tour together,

and Annie's moving in.

It's perfect.

I saw you look.

-I did not look.
-You looked.

I did not!

Anyway, I don't see
why you care so much.

I mean, you should
be happy for me.

I am happy for you!

You know, I'm just
trying to shake you

out of your domestic stupor.

How can you live with this girl?

You can't even get her
bra off during sex.


You guys are so cute.

Are you sure he didn't call?

Yes.

He was supposed to call
with the tour dates.

I told him I didn't want
to start on the East coast.

My following is in the Midwest.

Johnny, your following is
right here in this kitchen.

Oh, Wiley, go sit down.

Oh my god, this smells great.

That's the advantages of
living with a, you know,

a vet student.

You get fresh meats.

ANNIE: Ha.

This smells incredible.

Mm.

Oh my god, this is exactly
how mama used to make it.

Mama?

What are we, in the
"Sound of Music"?

She calls her mother "mama."

I hate the Sound of Music.

You know, it's the
one movie that makes

me want to root for the Nazis.

I'd like to push Sandy Duncan
right off one of those hills.

Oh no, no, you
mean Julie Andrews.

Even worse.

You know, that is so
funny, because I would

think you would love musicals.

Oh, that reminds me.

I think I found a
great guy for you.

I think you'd like him.

Yeah, I work with him at the
vet school and he is so funny!

His name is Rajneesh.

And actually, his
English is quite good.

Uh huh.

I am not going out with
an Indian named Rajneesh.

Shh!

Keep your voice down.

(INDIAN ACCENT) You are very

thank you very much.

Shh, that's so offensive, God.

And they don't
use toilet paper.

Would you shut up?

Look, Johnny.

Indians do not use toilet paper.

I'm very open to other
cultures, it just so happens

they don't use toilet paper.

Yeah, right, what do they do?

Scoot along the carpet?

They use their left hand
and a bucket of water.

Ugh, you are so disgusting.

Look, just don't discuss
my sex life with your wife.

She's not my wife, and
don't call her that.

Well what about that attack?

I would think that you
would love musicals,

you know, what was that about?

I am just so sick of this.

Sex is so useless.

Fags, ugh, I just want
to go out and dance.

You know, when I'm on the dance
floor, I feel so free, so wild.

Wait, what color are you?

I'm red.

I'm red!

No I'm red.

Shit!

Anyway, what do
you know about fags?

You run the minute you see one.

Well you would too
if you read this.

"The homosexual must
endlessly scavenge

city streets for the one
penis that satisfies him.

Tragically, he will
never find this penis

because it doesn't exist.

This formula is futile.

One penis plus one
penis equals failure.

The homosexual is condemned
to roam from penis to penis

until his often violent death."

That's it.

That's what I have to
look forward to, Johnny.

Pain.

Johnny, why do we
have to do this?

Can't we just go to bed?

I'm tired.

It's important to
live out our fantasies.

Oh hey, hey, hey.

This is your fantasy, not mine.

Look, try it on.

I promise if you don't like
it, I'll take it off you.

Very funny.

[music playing]

I look ridiculous.


You look absu--

Oh my God.

I'm taking this off.

No!

This is very romantic.

[tarzan music playing]

Oh my God, what was that?

Annie is safe with Johnny.

Oh Johnny, does it
have to be so loud?

I'm swinging through the
vine with you on my shoulder!

Oh, Johnny, I can't hear!

Can you turn it down?

Oh no, look, you're
scaring the bird.

Turn it-- turn it off.

[music playing]

WILEY: Hey.

Hey.

Look.

I gotta-- I gotta
tell you something.

I went into a-- a
gay bar last night.

-You went to a gay bar?
-Shh!

It wasn't a gay bar!


So what happened?

What do you mean,
what happened?

Nothing happened.

What was it like in there?

How would I know what
it was like in there?

You were there!

I was not there!

I didn't go in.

You didn't go inside?

No, I didn't go inside!

Why?

Look, I'm not going
to go into a gay bar.

It was like an audition for
the Village People in there.

Why would I go into a gay bar?

Because you've been
talking about it

for the last three years.

Shh!

You go into a gay bar!

Fine!

Hey, do you mind?

Look at you people.

Fawning all over each
other like rodents.

It's making me sick.

Wiley, lighten up.

Don't you people realize
that all relationships

are based on lies?

Based on ignoring the
hideous flaws of the person

you're with.

And you know why?

ALL: No, why?

Because you're all
afraid of dying.


-Here's to life.
-To life.

No, I'm not toasting.

I want to dance.

Let's dance.

Come on, Wiley.

Hey, I'm not gonna hop
around the floor like a moron.

This isn't solid gold.

[bowling pins]

I thought it was
going to be just us.

It is just us.

No, no.

Us is me and you.

Not the wife and kids.

This one I learned
from Earl Anthony.

Who's Earl Anthony?

Johnny knows every dismal fact
about professional bowling.

[music playing]

Annie?

Oh!

Oh my God, Stephan!

What are you doing here?

Bowling.

Of course.

Dumb question.

How's your dancing?

Well, I'm in vet school now.

Ah, what a shame.

No one could move like you.

Where are you living?

Um.

nowhere in particular.

Uh, what are you doing?

You know I have a dance studio.

Um, no, I didn't know that.

Yes.

We're creating an entirely
new type of dance.

It incorporates movement
and cast iron replicas.

Wow.

I can't believe he's got
his own dance company now.

You know, it's great to
meet a real intellectual.

Stephan is very talented.

The way he moves his body.

He looks really fit.

Oh, he has a very tight bod.

Did you really go out with him?

Years ago.

What was it like?

Oh, it was very superficial.

It was all sex.

Excuse me?

Oh, Jesus.

Sorry.

That's great!

That's incredible!

This is-- yeah.

Right.

So it's getting-- so how
does it get there-- the boat.

Of course.

Ha.

That's gr-- oh,
no, I understand.

Well what about-- OK, OK, no,
no, no, I'll talk to you later.

All right, good work, Murray.

Good work!

This is incredible!

What?

My album is getting
released overseas.

It got European distribution!

Wait a second.

Murray got you
European distribution?

Practically.

It's getting its first
release in Greenland.

The gateway to Europe.

I know where Greenland is.

God, that Murray.

That guy's a bulldozer.

Hey, I got this and you
didn't even notice it.

It's a new-- it's beaver.

Nice.

I told you a little
beaver wouldn't kill you.

Look, I gotta ask you a favor.


Oh my God, that was great.

Do it again!

Come on, please?

Do it again?

No, no, no.

Oh, why not?

Come on.

All right, do it again.

(IMITATING WICKED WITCH):
Who killed my sister?

Was it you?

I'll get you, my pretty,
and your little dog, too!


Oh, that was great.

Hey, you guys read that
thing about the ozone hole,

uh, above the antarctic?

It's getting bigger.

So what else can you do?

Well, I've been accused
of, uh, an OK Marlon Brando.

Oh, yeah!

Yeah, come on, do it!

Come on, Johnny.

No, no, no, come on.

Please?

JOHNNY: All right,
all right, all right.

Fuck that Bazzini business.

The person that comes to
you with the meeting--

he's the traitor.

No go get me the butter.


Oh, oh my God.

That was great.

[door opening]

What are you talking about?

To here is a great
job I can You know,

you find something
wrong with everybody.

Johnny, the guy
looked like he had

paste stuffed up one nostril.

How would you know?

You hardly even
looked at the guy.

I didn't have a chance
when you were so intriguing.

What is that supposed to mean?

I thought you were
gonna ask the waiter

to wheel in a grand piano.

That's ridiculous.

You know, I tried to get you
involved in the conversation,

but you sat there
sulking the whole time.

I was not sulking.

The whole thing
was just so boring.

Want some?

No.

Hey Wiley.

You think maybe the
reason you're so depressed

is cause you smoke too much pot?

I'm not depressed.

You think I'm depressed?

Annie thinks you're depressed.

Well what does she know?

Just because I hate everybody
doesn't mean I'm depressed.

I'm just being realistic.

Jesus, listen to you.

Do you really hate everybody?

Why shouldn't I?

I-- I'm being half serious here.

I mean, I'm sick of people.

I'm sick of myself.

I hate being weak.

I feel that if I
get close to girls,

they're going to want
to go to bed with me.

If I get close to guys, they're
going to think I'm a homo.

I thought you were a homo.

That has not been proven yet!

And I don't want to get AIDS.

It's not one of my
career goals to end

up with a horrific disease.

How could you
possibly get AIDS?

Hey, I got something I
think you'll appreciate.

I think you're
going to like this.

This videotape is banned in
most of the Western world.

[moaning on television]

[panting on television]

What is that?

On the left, that's the blonde.

And on the right,
that's the dog.

But what's that--
what's that ball?

That's the scarab, Johnny.

That's the ball
that locks the dog's

penis into the female's vagina.

I should have one of those.

Oh, wait, here,
the pig comes in.

JOHNNY: That's great.

That's incredible!

Jesus Christ, you're
a shark, Murray.

OK.

OK, all right, good.

Good work, Murray.

Good work!
See you tomorrow.

That was Murray.

We have a meeting with the label
first thing in the morning.

He's going to pick
me up at 9:00 AM.

[music playing]

WILEY: I got some--
I got some bad news

and I got some worse news.

JOHNNY: What?

WILEY: The Tribbles got signed.

JOHNNY: That's great.

WILEY: Johnny,
they got $300,000!

Anyway, what's the worse news?

We're going out to
dinner with my mother.

No.

No way.

Uh uh.

Oh come on, you can't
leave me there alone.

I am not going.

This place looks
like a soup kitchen!

This is a good place.

I don't like anything here.

Mother!

Wiley, why can't you ever
buy anything that fits?

This does fit!

Why are you getting so big?

We are not a big-boned family.

Did you call Brenda Saberman?

Yeah, I left her a message.

That's not what
Mrs. Saberman said.

She said Brenda hadn't
received one call from you.

Dad, has Uncle Irving
found a liver yet?

Don't change the subject.

Mother, I am not
interested in the daughters

of your mahjong partners.

Oh, you're impossible.

I can't say anything to you.

Wiley tells me you have
a record out, Johnny.

Brenda Saberman is one
of the most mainstream,

normal people I've ever known.

Mother, Brenda
Saberman is a simian.

You know, her knuckles
scrape the floors.

You haven't called
one girl that I've

tried to set you up with!

That's it!

I am going to the toilet.

What do you have
to say about this?

You know, your
mother's a shark.

It was like a feeding frenzy.

Don't insult my mother.

She bought you dinner.

Ingrate.

You two are perfect
for each other.

[door opening]

WILEY: Fine, I'm fine.

Get off me.

Ugh, oh my God.





[music playing]

No, it's true.

I am exploring the outer
limits of masturbation.

Uh huh.

I think I finally solved
the problem of chafing.

Great.

This whole human interaction
thing is so overrated.


You are so beautiful.

Oh, it feels like
it's been so long.

Too long.

Oh, you're so sexy.

It's OK, Johnny.

Latex is an
artificial material.

Shh.

I love cuddling with
you just as much.

You don't have to say
those things, because--

Oh, you are so
hard on yourself.

I just-- can't get the
Tribbles out of my mind.

You're thinking
about the Tribbles?

WILEY: Can I-- can
I get you anything?

Tea or pot?

Water?

Bondage films?

Christ, what a night.

What's wrong with you?

I have to face facts.

I think Annie's a little
jealous of my-- well,

I don't want to say
success, but everything

that's been happening to me.

Did you fight again?

No, we didn't fight.

We were very open
with each other.

Then I left and I came here.

She just needs some time
to get her head together.

That's all.

I'm sure she's fine right now.

I just needed to chill out.

Thanks a lot, Wiley.

Where are you going?

I'll talk to you later.

I thought we were going
to fry up some popcorn.

Johnny!

I have no time for breakfast!

I'll be home right
after the meeting.

Oh, no I won't.

Murray wants to go
look at tour buses.

Johnny.

Murray called.

He canceled.

He canceled?

He canceled.

He canceled?

He canceled!

But that's impossible!

The-- the tour starts
in three weeks.

Why didn't you let
me talk to him.

You were in the shower!

Yeah, he said something
about the guys from Geffen

couldn't make it in til
tomorrow or the next day.

That's totally normal.

Murray must be
having more trouble

hammering out the liability
question than he thought.


This is so typical of
the music industry.

[phone ringing]

Hey, slow down.

I can't-- I can't understand
a word you're saying.

All right, I'll be right there.

I can't--

Oh my God, be careful!

Oh, just grab it!

Oh, you're hitting it too hard!

Oh, shit.

How'd it-- how'd it
get out of the cage?

I was trying to put
a splint on its wing.

Look out!


Oh my God!

I just stunned it.

Oh my God!

I think it's just stunned.


Don't touch me.

I told you it was a mistake.

I mean, she's a moody,
demanding vivisectionist.

Wait a second, I'm
the monster here.

I'm gradually slaughtering
all of her animals.

You killed one bird.

Now that's a start, but
it's not nearly enough.

You should just ask
her to move out.

I should asked her to move out?

She should ask me to move out!

You've gotta take
care of your own life.

Hey, my life is fine!

I'm leaving you.

What do you mean,
you're leaving me?

Johnny, it's just-- I don't
think it's working out.

Of course it's working out--

No.

I think this is best.

What's best?

Going away for a little while?

I'm moving out.

You can't-- can't
just leave on a whim.

You've gotta have a plan!

You've gotta map things out!

You've gotta think
things through before you

just decide to move out.

I'm staying with
Elena til Friday.

Her brother's picking
up my stuff on Saturday.

And then I'm subletting
this place until spring.

How could you be so
methodical about this?

This is our life
you're talking about.

Can we please not talk
about this right now?

Just carry my trunk down.

[heavy breathing]

JOHNNY: I think it's
probably for the best.

She saw me going places,
and she saw herself

staying in the same old rut.

She just couldn't handle it.

I don't know about that.

Hey, fuck you, you losers!

That's Veruca Salt. Don't look!

So what?

Just don't look!

Look, let's just
get out of here--

No!

Let's just get out of here!

Now I gotta go in
because you looked.

Don't go in there.

You're going to make a
fool out of yourself.

Shut up, they're my friends.
Just shut up--

You hardly know them!

Stop looking.

Stop looking.

Hour-long psychedelic
jams that are gonna--

they're no masturbatory--

Stay out here.

We've got the--

Just-- shh.

Jesus.

Nina!

Louise!

How you guys doing?

You know, I was walking
by, I saw you sitting here

in the window, and
I know it would've

been really rude of me if I had
just, you know, not come in.

So how's everything going?

I heard the album I liked it.

I did.

But what if on that
second song you

dropped the vocals
down just a bit,

and you brought the guitars up?

The second song's a cappella.

I-- I thought
you guys wrote it.

Anyway, I, I have an album out.

You might have heard
it, um, "Here's Johnny"?

Well, it's just getting
in the stores now.

I mean, we're going the small,
limited distribution, um,

Murray Shuman, European,
Greenland thing, um--

Excuse me?

We were in the
middle of something.

Yeah, we kind of need
to talk about some stuff.

I know how it is.

I know how it is,
the-- the distractions,

the people, the groupies,
you know, the pastarazzi.

Would you please leave now?

OK.

I'll talk to you guys later.


Took your burrito?

What a dick!

Let's get the hell out of here.

[music playing]

Johnny, back again.

Here's Johnny,
I'm my own friend.

[music playing]

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Murray?

Murray.

You're kidding!

Oh, thank you!

Thank you, Murray!

All right.

All right.

Talk to you later.

I gotta tell Annie.

I gotta tell Annie.

I'm sorry.

[dog barking]

I don't want any cool
effects or fancy edits

or any of this MTV shit.

I just want a good video.

So you really made it.

I don't want to jinx
anything, but it looks good.

I would like to make a
toast to my beloved Cynthia.

Stop it, Alistair!

Johnny.

May his success pave the
way for the rest of us.

You know, we really should
be toasting Murray here.

I'm bored.

Let's play "I never."

No, I don't wanna know what
virtual strangers have done

with their organs, you know?

That's what talk shows are for.

Alistair likes it when I don't
shower for a couple of days.

OK.

OK, um, next question.

OK, I'll go.

I'll go.

Um, let's see.

Uh, I've never faked an orgasm.

My turn!
Right.

Let's see.

Uh.

I have never had sex with a man.

Johnny, oh my God!

Annie, are you aware
of this little deviance?

Of course.

When was this?

It was nothing.

It was-- a long time ago.

It was two kids rough-housing.

Where was it?

It was in the shower.

But you know, it was nothing.

I shouldn't have brought it up.

It was-- it was stupid.

We just fooled around,
we didn't have sex.

Alistair likes anal sex!

Shut up, Cynthia!

Alistair says it's the best
contraception in the world,

don't you, Alistair!

Yes, but we don't give
away all our little secrets,

do we now, Cynthia?

What you laughing at?

George and Martha over here.

You're in a pretty good
mood for a homosexual

who's never had sex with a man.

Well what about the
Englishman from Pittsburgh?

I am not from Pittsburgh.

Yes you are.

I left at a very young age.

About the same age you
discovered buggery, I believe.

What did you say?

I said about the same age
you discovered buggery.

What's buggery?

Buggery is a term used for what
you people call butt fucking.


Fuck you.

Fuck all of you!

Wiley!

I'll talk to him.

Wiley!

Wiley!

Stop!


Get off me!

Ow!

Ah, Jesus Christ!

Wiley, what the
hell's wrong with you?

Nobody meant to hurt you.

Bullshit.

I'm so sick of your
stupid friends.

I don't want to be your
little sidekick anymore.

I don't want to be C3PO.

You're not C3PO.

You're the-- the most
important person in my life.

What about Annie?

Yeah, Annie's important.

I mean but it's just
you-- it's different.

Well I'm still sick of them.

Look, forget about them.

They don't care.

I mean, Alistair and
Cindy-- they're probably

in a fist fight by now.

And Annie-- come
on, she loves you.

Johnny?

What.

Do you smell something?

What?

Do you smell shit?

Oh, shit!

Oh my God!


Ah!

Shit!

Oh, God, it's in my hair!

It's disgusting!

I hate anything that
shits uncontrollably.

Like dogs and babies.

JOHNNY: Will you
hurry up in there?

Hey, you want to come
in and do my back?

JOHNNY: No!

Hey, Johnny.

JOHNNY: What?

Did you really have
sex in the shower?

JOHNNY: Oh God.

No.

Who was it with?

JOHNNY: It was nothing.

I shouldn't have
even brought it up.

Well, what happened?

JOHNNY: We were like 13 or 14.

There was a bunch of us.

We were playing Truth
or Dare or something.

So Sean I got dared to go
to down to the poolhouse--

Sean?

Yeah, Sean.

So we got dared to go to the
pool house shower and, uh--

Wait, Sean-- Sean Minos?

JOHNNY: Yes, Sean Minos.

So we're in the shower and
we take off our bathing suits

and we start fooling around.

And in about 30 seconds we came.

It was nothing.

Sean Minos!

It's all yours.

Does it have a name?

No, it's a laboratory rat.

And I'm going to kill it.

Oh my God.

I can't do it.

[phone ringing]

I can't do it.

Hello?

Murray.

Yeah.

Uh huh?

Uh huh.

OK.

I understand.

That's great.

Great!

OK.

I'll talk to you later.

Good work, Murray.

That was Murray.

Label postponed.

Again?

I thought it was all set.

It is all set.

They just have to,
you know, finish

hammering out those details,
and the liability question.

It's totally normal.

No, Johnny.

This is not normal.

Murray doesn't show up
when he's supposed to,

and whenever you're supposed
to meet one of these guys,

they cancel.

Don't you think
that's a little weird?

What are you saying?

Murray's lying to me?

Murray hasn't done
one thing for you.

What are you talking about?

Well, you paid for the CD's.

You pay for the studio time.

He hasn't done a damn thing!

Murray Shuman got me
European distribution.

I'm already being test marketed
in Greenland right now.

How do you know your
album is in Greenland?

Because Murray told me.

Don't you think you should
check up on some of this work

he's supposedly doing?

Yeah, I should spy on
my friend and manager.

That's crazy.

All I'm saying is, is that
it's your life, Johnny.

Yeah, it is my life.

And I don't need you ruining
it with your paranoia.

It's like you're out to get me.

Where are you going?

You don't want me
to succeed, do you?

[knock on door]

Hey.

I gotta make a phone call.

All right, just don't
call long distance.

Yeah, right.

Who am I gonna call?

Yeah, operator.

I want to place a
call to Greenland.

I can't believe you
called Greenland.

I'll pay you back.

Greenland.

They didn't have them.

It's OK.

It doesn't mean anything.

Yeah, I mean, maybe they just
didn't get there yet, right?

Besides, you only
called one record store.

Greenland only has
one record store.

Oh.

Maybe Murray isn't
being straight with you.

You're talking about
Murray Shuman here.

Jesus Christ.

Just bring it up to him.

Maybe it was Iceland.

Yeah, I will bring it up to him.

Just as soon as we get signed.

[music playing]

What is this?

This is a record I bought
to make a move on this girl.

I knew she was
gonna fall for it.

I put it on, and I was
all ready to make a move.

Then the first song ended,
and then the second,

and then the third.

By the time the album ended I
hadn't done anything at all.

She left.

So what happened?

Nothing.

She had a boyfriend
two days later.

It's typical.

So typical.

I blew it.

You didn't blow it.

You just-- they hadn't
figured out women yet.

You can't let those
opportunities pass you by.

You gotta just pounce on them.

Sorry.

I have to go.

Fuck!

Hey, uh, I got some,
uh, CD's on hold.

Hey, Joe.

Johnny.

Yeah--

Yeah.

Hey, congratulations.

I heard about your deal.

Here you go.

That's great.

Boy, Jesus, things-- must have
really changed things, huh?

Eh, I don't know, man.

The only thing that's changed, I
had to add a second phone line,

cause you know, all
the business calls.

Oh.

[door opening]

Hi.

Hi.

Any calls?

Nope.

Did Murray call?

Nope.

I was hoping he'd call.

I need to know the status
on the liability question.

Well, he didn't call.

Maybe I should get
another line installed.

You know, just for
the band stuff.

Johnny, what's going on
between you and Wiley?

Wiley hasn't
called me in a week.

Why aren't you
returning my calls?

Would you stop stalking me?

Why aren't you
returning my calls?

I think it's obvious, Johnny.

Because I won't sleep with you?

Johnny, I don't want to
talk to you right now.

Look, you don't have to
sleep with all your friends.

This isn't prep school.

Oh, fuck you.

[music playing]

[phone ringing]

[movie playing]

[door opening]

Where's Wiley?

I don't know

You're lying to me.

I don't know.

Where is he?

[music playing]

heart afraid of breaking

that never learns to live.

It's the dream afraid of waking.

Wiley, can we talk about this?

Fuck you.

Johnny, you've been
avoiding me for days.

What do you mean?

Well, the only time
I see you is when

I happen to catch you at home.

You're avoiding me.

That's impossible, Annie.

We live together.

How could I be avoiding you?

Well, Johnny.

I need you now more than ever.

The vet school's
having a talent show.

I'm going to perform.

I think I finally found a way
to combine my love for dance

and my love for animals.

I need your support.

Johnny, are you listening to me?

Yeah.

I support you.

You're not even here.

I am here.

No, no!

Maybe physically you're
here, but not emotionally!

Not-- not mentally.


OK.

It's OK.

It's OK.

I'm-- I want to be
totally honest with you.

Everything is happening so fast.

My album, the tour, the
label, our relationship.

I'm trying.

Maybe not so well,
but I'm trying

to strike a balance between
our relationship and my career.

What career are
you talking about?

My album.

Oh, Johnny, your
album is a flop.

My album is not a flop.

You sold a dozen copies.

Half of them have been returned.

It's gotten terrible reviews.

It has no distribution.

Murray is
distributing my album.

Oh, Murray couldn't
distribute leaflets!

My album is in Greenland!

Murray has gotten me
European distribution!

Murray is negotiating
my record deal!

He doesn't even return
your phone calls.

Murray is a busy man!

[music playing]

(ON PHONE)Hello,
Murray Shuman here.

Leave a message, and I'll
get back to you in a flash.


Murray, it's me.

Call me as soon as
possible at 384-9634.

[door opening]

What do you want?

Let's call a truce.

Just wait outside.

[music playing]

What are you--
what are you doing?

Look, Johnny.

You don't have to do this.

I want to do this.

I made a big mistake.

It was really stupid.

I just want to forget
the whole thing.

What are you thinking about?

My mother.

JOHNNY (VOICEOVER):
It wasn't that bad.

There was something so innocent
about Wiley's clumsiness.

WILEY (VOICEOVER): God,
I was good last night.

I guess all that
practice really paid off.

I wanna tell him it was fun.

No.

Great lovers never talk
about their technique.

I don't want him to
think I'm obsessed.

JOHNNY (VOICEOVER): Jesus.

Everyone's watching me!

I'm still normal.

Bisexuality is very in.

Mick Jagger did it.

WILEY (VOICEOVER): I
wonder what he's thinking.

JOHNNY (VOICEOVER):
Pete Townshend.

David Bowie.

Lou Reed.

God, I bet he's thinking
about it all the time.

I bet he wants to do it right
now, right on the table!

Do you think Madonna will ever
be a real-- real movie star?

WILEY (VOICEOVER): Madonna?

Yeah, I sound like a homosexual.

JOHNNY (VOICEOVER): No.

I gotta stop this.

I love Annie.

I--I can't sleep with Wiley.

Look, he's not your mistress.

Just say something.

Stew is great.

WILEY (VOICEOVER): Next time
I really want to hold back.

Make him beg for it.

Look.

We can't do that again.

No, no.

I agree.

I agree.

Absolutely not.

Johnny.

If you never saw
me before, would

you think I was attractive?

Depends how many beers I had.

Ha ha ha.

No, if I saw you,
I'd definitely think

you were interesting looking.

That's not what I asked.

You know, would you
think I was attractive?

Yeah.

Good.

So, what are we going to do?

What do you mean?

I mean, what are
we going to do?

What are we going
to do about Annie?

What are you going to tell her?

Why would I tell
Annie anything?

Because we're doing it.

Because we just did it.

We did not just do it.

We didn't just do it?

No.

Well, what would you call it?

Normal male bonding
that's a little more

advanced than normal.

Well, try telling Annie that.

Hey, just leave
Annie to me, OK?

Everything's fine.

[door slamming]

Wiley?

Oh my God, Wiley, how are you?

Fine.

I'm so happy to see you.

Sit down!

Me and Johnny, we were so
sad when you weren't around.

Well, I have my
own life, you know.

Look at you!

You look like you're
dressed for Mardi Gras.

This?

This-- my closet
light went out and I

couldn't see anyone-- anything.

Are you seeing someone?

That's absurd!

Are you?

It's like, totally abs--

You are seeing someone!

Oh my God, no wonder
you haven't been around.

This is great!

Um, shit.

I have to go.

Final dissections are today.

But promise me this,
I'm going to write it

down in my book for Saturday.

We are going to double date.

No, that can't--

I can't believe that
Johnny didn't tell me.

Wiley and friend.

Why didn't Johnny tell me?

Well, we are going to
have a talk about this.

OK, wish me luck!

Good luck.

Thanks.

Go wake that guy up.

Hey, it's like 60
degrees outside.

We should go to the park
or the zoo or something.

What time is it?

It's early.

Must me great to
sleep in a real bed.

Did Murray call?

How would I know
if Murray called?

Ah, I gotta piss.

I can't go to the
park with you today.

I got too much shit to do.

Hey, are Alistair
and Cindy here?

No!

I should call Murray.

[door opening]

[music playing]

Johnny.

Annie.

Hey, I forgot my notebook.

I gotta go.

It's not in here.

Good luck!

I told you this
was going to happen.

I told you to say
something to her.

I mean, how long did you think
we could keep us a secret?

We weren't doing anything.

What are you talking about?

We were practically
sodomizing each other.

Quit making it sound like
we're having an affair.

Well what the hell is it, then?

Nothing.

It's a mistake.

A mistake?

Everything between us
has been a mistake?

There is no us.

What do you mean?

There is you, and there is me.

There is no us.

Of course there is.

Look, everything was a mistake.

From the first time on, was
just one of those crazy mistakes

that friends make.

Oh, OK.

I see.

Fuck you, Johnny.

I gotta stop her.

I gotta find her before she
jumps to any conclusions.

[music playing]

Johnny, what are
you doing here?

I'm in the middle
of my dissection.

It was a mistake.

I was helping out a friend.

You know, it's like Tom
Sawyer and Huck Finn.

What are you talking about?

I'm not saying
it's Wiley's fault,

but you know how
manipulative he can be.

What are you doing here?

There is nothing
between me and Wiley.

It was a schoolboy thing.

What do you mean
a schoolboy thing?

You come here in the middle
of my dissection to tell me

you're having a gay
affair with Wiley?

Shh!

I never said anything about gay!

I don't believe this.

Just-- just get out of here.

We can talk about this
like reasonable adults.

[door slamming]

OK, we'll talk
when you get home.

What-- what is happening?

What is happening with the tour?

With the label?

With the album?

What is happening?

Where did you disappear to?

I know what you thinking.

I know what you're
trying to do--

No, no, just, I want to
know what's happening.

What do you mean?

You have been acting
very unreliable lately.

If you're acting
this way with me,

how do I know you're not
acting this way with the label?

OK.

This is very
embarrassing for me.

So, why are you
showing me pills?

Read it.

Prozac.

So, you're on Prozac.

Johnny, I've been diagnosed
with attention deficit

disorder and
depression, manifesting

itself in pathological lying.

What are you saying?

What-- what are you trying--
what are you saying?

That the label, that the tour--
are you saying that everything,

everything was just a lie?

No!

Most everything I
told you is the truth.

CYNTHIA: I am not fat!

No!

ALISTAIR: We signed
an agreement.

Now get on the scale.

CYNTHIA: No, fuck you!

You're crazy!

ALISTAIR: What is
this-- what is this?

Fucking Cheetos?

Cheetos under the bed,
really, that's really tacky.

CYNTHIA: Those are mine.
They're mine!

No, they're mine!

Wiley.

Thank God you're here.

I think Annie's a
little upset with me.

I didn't come to
talk you, Johnny.

I'm looking for my underwear.

Wiley.

My silk boxers.

Wiley, everything's fucked up.

Well that's your special
touch, isn't it, Johnny.

What am I going to do?

Oh, I'm so concerned about you.

Give me a break!
-Wiley, I--

I don't give a shit about you!

I did this all for you!

Oh, fuck you!

Where the hell are my boxers?

I don't give a shit
about your fucking boxers!

Give me my boxers!

Fuck you!

Give them back!

I threw my relationship
out the window for you!

Give me my boxers!

I destroyed Annie for
you, isn't that enough?

Fuck you and your
stupid housewife!

Fuck you, I'm sick of you and
your stupid fucking self pity!

You're full of shit!

Give them to me,
you cocksucker!

You fucking faggot!

[ripping fabric]

Those are Annie's.

I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

Put the guitar down.

Uh-uh.

Put it down!

Give me the hat first!

Give me the guitar.

No!

Give me the guitar, and
nothing happens to the hat.

No.

[door opening]

[music playing]


You two make me sick.

Stop it.

Stop it.

Stop it!

You're a fucking
asshole, Johnny!

Fuck you.

You two deserve each other.

You punch like a girl.

I'm leaving you, Johnny.

Good, leave.

I don't care.

Just get out of my
life, the both of you.

You're a loser, Johnny.

Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Fuck you!

ALL: Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Fuck you!




DOCTOR: Your friend is going
to make a full recovery.

Oh, thank God.

Oh, thank God.

He's going to be OK.

God, I love that guy.

I think we just need a
break from each other.

Yeah.

I agree.

We--we all just
need some time alone.

I think I'm gonna-- I'm
gonna move in with Elena.

For real this time.

That's a good idea.

I think we just all need to
go our own separate ways,

and whatever happens, happens.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Are you hungry?

I'm starving.

I haven't eaten all day.

Maybe we should grab a bite.

There is that Polish place.

I hate that place.

ANNIE: Well, what about that
new little Pan Asian place?

WILEY: I-- I-- I don't
like Pan Asian places.

I mean, if they won't tell
me where they're from,

I-- I'm not gonna-- I'm
not gonna eat there.

JOHNNY: Well, how about tapas?

I mean, there's not a
lot to it, but, you know,

if you order enough--

WILEY: I-- I'm boycotting
Spanish restaurants

because of the Inquisition.

I just can't eat there.

JOHNNY: Prozac.

WILEY: Not for dinner, Johnny.

JOHNNY: No, I mean, now
that Murray's on Prozac,

I really think things are going
to start happening for me.

ANNIE: Well, what about pizza?

Pizza always makes
you feel good.

JOHNNY: First of all, there's
no good pizza in Chicago.

It's impossible.

WILEY: Johnny, one
week in New York

and you come back an expert.

JOHNNY: What about
that place over there?

WILEY: No, I hate that place.

The waitress has an oxygen
tank that she wheels around.

ANNIE: That's not true.

JOHNNY: Look, I got a place.

What about that
all-you-can-eat Indian place.

ANNIE: Yeah, yeah,
Indian sounds good.

WILEY: No, I don't
want all-you can eat.

ANNIE: Well you don't
have to eat it all.

You just have to go there and--

WILEY: Yeah, but the food
is never as good at a buffet

as it is when you
just order a la carte.

JOHNNY: Yeah, but then
you don't have to tip.

Why not just go for chop suey?

ANNIE: Italian.

BOTH: Italian chop suey?

ANNIE: No, just Italian.

WILEY: No, you-- the
Italian place here,

it's owned by the mafia.

They serve you a
broken leg of lamb--

JOHNNY: How about Mexican?

[music playing]

JOHNNY: Good work, Murray.

Good work.
