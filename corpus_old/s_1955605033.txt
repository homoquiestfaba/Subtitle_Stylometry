Subrip by DanDee

I made the last of the bacon.
Go ahead, eat.

All right.

Seems odd.

First day of work,
me taking you.

Like the first day of school,

only so different
than I remember.

Come on, Ma, don't.

What?

I just wish things
were different, that's all.

I told you this is
what I wanted to do.

Yeah.

You know, I'm lucky to get on
at the warehouse.

It's good money.
Good job.

Maybe I should
pick up more shifts.

What are you talking about?

You're already working
too many hours as it is.

What about Colleen and Bernard?
They need you.

When did you get so smart?

Come on, Ma, we gotta go.

I hate this place.

Ma.

Well, I appreciate
your helping us out though.

I know.
You told me 100 times.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Hey, what's up?

No worries, G.

All right, man.
You're gonna love this job.

Get up there.

Mr. Green is on the way.

Your dinner will be
in the microwave.

Just reheat it
for four minutes on medium.

I'm gonna be at my sister's.

Girls' night out.

<i>I feel like such a failure.</i>

<i>Well, you're not.</i>

<i>You are doing
the very best you can.</i>

Well, he wanted to go
to culinary school

and I stuck him
in that factory.

Well, first of all,
he's not stuck.

And B, it is not forever.

I'm just afraid he's gonna turn to
stone in that place.

Oh, come on, turn your frown
upside down.

Let's go wait tables.

I don't know how
to make this palpably clear.

You know, I got a team of 10 Chinese
delegates coming here

to inspect 20 fucking
layers going out to Beijing

at $750,000 a pop,

and I'm missing two of them.

I want accountability.

I'll take care of it for you.

Hey, boss, this is Dave Willis.

You know, I told you about him.

All right, walk with me.

Vardi says you do good work.

Yes, sir.
Anybody ask you around here,

You make apprentice pay,
all right?

I'm on good terms
with the union.

I like the union.
They like me.

Let's not fuck it up.

Okay, Louis,
two roast beef, one end cut.

Louis, you're killing me,
I need the shrimp cocktail,

onion soup, green salad
with dressing on the side.

Shrimp oregatano,
chicken rollatini,

mushrooms on the side.
Hey, wait a second.

I'm still waiting on my order.

Wait some more.
Really.

Really?

Don't keep me waiting, Louis.

Oh, and there's
no more end cuts.

Eh, what's this?

Roast beef.

I ordered an end cut.

That's all they had left.

Well, why didn't you come back?

Well, before you said
you were in a rush,

and that's what they gave me.

Look, honey, I'm used
to getting what I order.

And when I order an end cut,

I either get the end cut,

or I'm given the opportunity
to get something else,

because I don't like other people
making up my mind for me.

Come on, Ed.
She's just a waitress.

Not bad, huh?

Yeah, nice leather.

Yeah, you know, you'll
be looking fresh, too,

if you just pay
attention to what I gotta say,

keep your mouth shut,
and let me handle everything, huh?

Yeah, I don't wanna be stuck here
for the next 30 years.

Yeah, that's fucking right.
Let's go.

Hey, Ma.

Hey, what did you buy now?

Look, we got...
We gotta cut back.

I can't keep paying
for all the cell phones.

You can keep yours,
but I'm gonna shut mine off.

Oh, hey, Ma, you're not
turning your phone off.

Now that I got a job,
you know, you can keep it.

Well, that's awfully
sweet, honey,

but, look, and I don't
want you cooking tonight.

You should go out
with your friends.

Nah, I gotta go in
at 6:00 tomorrow.

Relax.

Relax?

That's not a word
in my vocabulary.

Ma, it's not your fault.

Pops smoked three packs a day.

I can't even think about him
without filling

his coffin with bills,

including the one from the cemetery
and the funeral parlor.

Ma, come here.

Mmm.

You know, look, I love you.

It's gonna be all right.

I love you, too.

So, it's no big deal to
let me in then. Come on.

You know, Dave, it's not a game,
you know?

I know.

My mother's been
torturing herself.

I gotta do something, man.
I gotta make some...

Look, man, you should just
be happy

I got you the job here
in the first place.

I know, and you said
if I did a good job,

you'd talk about
something else.

God, you're busting me.

All right, you know what?

Give me a few days
and I'll see what I can do.

I am.

All right, then
shut the fuck up.

Jesus.

How you doing?

Yo, what's up?

Hey.

Right where your father sat.

You don't even have
to check my ID anymore.

Put that away.

I'm the man
in my house now, Dez.

That's the only
way your father would want it.

Yeah.

I miss him.

Nothing's the same.
Not this place, the block...

Nothing.

Yeah, you got that right.

Don't become a mess
like them punks

I gotta deal with every night.

Not me.

I have to deal with my mom.

She worries every second,

even when I'm doing
the right thing.

She's a tough one.
Always was.

Yeah, she's pissed
I'm working at the metal factory

instead of being in school.

I know.

I gotta make more money.
I gotta be the man.

She's heartbroken
your father's gone.

I offered to help, but she won't let me.
Hey, no, no, no.

I'm handling it.

She met your father
right here where you're sitting.

I know.

I just wish he didn't
sit here forever.

He loved you.

He freaking had your
christening party here,

left you sleeping in the booth.

Yeah.

Life flies.

Just keep doing the right thing

with your life, okay, kid?

<i>Drink up.
Salud.</i>

Yo.

Time for your job interview.

All right?

Maybe I'll start
you out running bath salts.

Remember those crazy
fucking kids over there in the park?

Every now and then,
do a little a run.

Little hole in the wall.

What a mess made.

You just keepyour mouth shut
to everyone but me.

Are we clear?

So, what's with
our friend, huh,

over there in the bar?

It's no good.

Blabbing all over
the neighborhood now.

He's gonna clean
this place up with what?

Drug-free bullshit?

People ain't happy.

Yeah, I know,
I know. Me, too.

Maybe you ought to do
something about that.

Yeah.

Yeah, you know, he called the cops
twice last week.

It's not good for business.

You know why
you're here, right?

Because of him.

We run a business.
We don't beat nobody.

Move everything
at a good price.

I put quality shit in the street
for a lot of years.

You do the volume,

they come back.

Thank you, Luige.

Hey, it's so good to see you guys
out as a family again.

How you two doing?
Good, hungry.

Keep it up.

And you, Ma?

We missed you.

But, you know, things haven't
been so easy lately.

Yo, hey, everything's
changing though, right?

I'm over there working
at the steel factory now.

It's going good.
We're getting back on our feet.

Yeah, but that's
only for a little bit,

because, you know,
he's going to college, right, Ronnie?

Soon enough, Ma.

Well, it's all I wish for.

Good advice.
Listen to your mother.

Eat that. It makes
everything all right.

Be careful, it's hot.

Yo, yo, watch the master.

What's up?

What's good, my brother?

Mmm, how you doing?

Good, man. And you?

Two packets today
of the ivory wave.

Two.

Yes.

One, two for you.

All right.

Buckle my shoe.

Yo, Robbie, this is Dave.
He's my boy.

He's good.

Well, enjoy your day.

Yeah.

All right, yo, so, you sell
the crystal first,

and then the ivory wave and
you start getting paid, huh?

But you're gonna
make a lot of coin. A lot of coin.

Better start selling some shit.

Oh, man, this is quality.
Nothing finer.

Yo, here we go.

All right.

I'm Blackie.

No mistakes.

Yes, sir.

What's this?

For whatever you want.

Is this your salary?

It's table money, Ma.
Use it.

Do something, go shopping.

Things are gonna
change around here.

We're not living
like dogs anymore.

There you go, man.
Try that on.

These look great.

This is so awesome.

You like that?
They fit perfectly.

Ma, look what Dave got!

What is all this, Dave?

I worked some overtime.

Well, you shouldn't
have done this.

Here, turn it on.

No, no, no. You gotta take it back.
We've got bills.

The bills are paid.

Ma, you should be
happy. Smile.

I mean, look at these, Ma,
they're brand new!

Jeez, Ma, can't you
let them enjoy it?

Don't you think we've
been through enough?

You know what, then?

Fuck it.
Throw it away.

You know, we'll just stay the fucking
depressed family

for the rest of our life.
That's what you want?

Man, looking to buy?

You got the green?

All righty, then.

Don't worry about that.

Son of a bitch.

I thought I was rid of these goddamn
fucking drug dealers.

Shit. I'm tired
of this shit.

I'm tired of being
the fucking good guy.

<i>¶ We are contained
We bring the pain</i>

<i>¶ Fuck with your brain ¶</i>

You kids get
the fuck outta here.

You're ruining
the fucking neighborhood!

That's for your father, Davey!

Fuck!

Dave, you all right?

Fuck!

I don't understand.
How could this have happened?

I told you.
Steel girder came out of nowhere.

Look how swollen it is.

Maybe he should
get an X-ray.

Davey?

What?

One little whack in the back
and you're out?

Look, that's no good for me.
See, I brought you in.

Well, maybe it's not the great idea
I thought it was.

What the fuck
are you talking about?

I want nothing to do
with running this shit.

No, we gotta make a drop.

Yeah, my mama keeps
asking about the money.

You know what she's like when she
wants to get to the bottom of things.

No, see, I haven't been in your house
since she figured out

I was the one who took the fiver
from her pocketbook.

You came begging
to me, remember?

We're making a fucking drop.

What are you doing here?

I wanted to see if he's such a
tough guy without his little stick.

No, see, we gotta make peace.

See, this is one
of our best spots.

Yeah, I don't know.

My back still kind of hurts.

All right.
Let me handle this.

Hey, Dezy,

we just came by
to say you were right.

We shouldn't have been doing
what we were doing.

It was wrong.

I'm sorry about it.

You didn't need
to beat on us like you did.

You could've talked to us.

Right?

But, hey, it's the past, right?

Ancient history. So why
don't we forget about it?

Have a beer.

Look at that, huh?

I told you my way
was best, Davey.

We don't want no trouble.

Now, I want you to get
the fuck outta here.

When I'm ready.

All right.

Have it your way.

You know, I think I forgot
my smokes in the car.

You need a cigarette?
I got it here.

No, you know,
I got a fresh pack in the car.

Thank you.
Be right back.

Look, Davey, why don't
you two guys try working?

What you're doing out there
is destroying the neighborhood.

Well, I got a job, Dezy.

Where? Selling shit
in the park?

Come on, Davey,
that's not a job.

What shit are you
selling in here?

My fucking father sat in this
bar for 20 years.

He pissed away
every dime he ever made.

Your father was a good man.

My father was a piece of shit.

No, your father took care of you,
your mother,

your brother, your sister.
He took care of you.

You never had to live with him.
You didn't have to...

Every day. I know I didn't have
to live with him.

But what do you...
Shut the fuck...

Oh, God.

This is Dave Willis.
Uh, yes, sir.

Yes, sir, I'm gonna
stand right here.

Okay, I'll be right here.

Bye.

Fuck.

Mike went out for cigarettes.

Cigarettes.

Detective, how many
times do I have to tell you?

I mean, I already
told you in the other room.

I want to hear it again.

I went out to my car

because I left
my cigarettes there.

So I had a cigarette.

Must've been one hell
of a cigarette, huh?

And that's when I saw the guy
come out of the bar.

Can you identify this guy?

No.

He was wearing a ski mask.

How about you?
You know who this guy is?

No.

Do you, uh... Do you believe
your friend here?

Yeah.

Is that right?

So, nobody knows about this
mysterious masked man, huh?

I mean, how are we
supposed to know?

It's probably some guy whose,
you know, drinks he watered down.

You know...

If you had nothing
to do with it,

there's a guy
out there wondering

if you can make him.

And if you did have
something to do with it...

I've been at this game
a lot longer than you two.

Fucking cops, man.

Could have at least brought
my fucking car over here,

leave it by the park.

Somebody's gonna fucking
break into it. Jeez.

You don't ever stop.

You just fucking
killed somebody, Mike.

Say that again and you will fucking
regret it, all right?

I wasn't even there.

It's fucking...
It's over for me. I'm done.

Hey, Davey...

Don't fucking touch me!

Hey! Come on, Davey.

Look, I've got... I've got some pure
stuff back in my house.

So, why don't we just go and
we forget about this, all right?

Huh? What do you say?

Hey, where are you going?

I'm going home!

Yo, you're doing
a pickup today.

Today, and that's it.

Yeah, you better keep
your mouth shut.

I do.

Yeah, I knew that
till last night.

Dave, you wanna
try getting up? It's 12:30.

Just a second.

Want me to fix you
some breakfast?

Nah, I'm okay.

Are you gonna come to Bernard's
football game with me?

I can't today, Ma, I'm busy.

What are you so busy with?

All right, Ma.
Please don't start.

I gotta roll.

32.71.

I've got 53 and 40 cents.

57.90.

That's five dollars each
to the busboys.

We split the rest, 41 on each.

I don't know, you keep
coming up short, Rita.

It's not fair.
"Fare" is something I pay on the subway.

In this restaurant we got rules.
We split the tips.

It just seems like
a raw deal for us.

You're an old lady.
What are you doing here?

Hey. What did you
just call her?

Hey. Here, take it.

I got enough trouble
in my life as it is.

Out here, everybody's
got trouble.

Hey, Bobby.

Rough shift?

Yeah.

You look like you don't
punch back enough.

I'm too tired.

No, it's not that.

You look like you let people take
advantage of you.

Just saying, Ann. Not me.

Nobody takes advantage of me.

If they want something,
I let them have it,

or I don't let them have it.

The point is, I call the shots.

You should try it sometime.

Thanks.

Hey.

Aw, looky, looky.

Hey, Davey,
Vicki wants to re-up,

so, uh, do me a favor
and drop off a bag.

Oh, you know what? Actually,
drop off two bags. Why not? You know?

All right.

Hey, by the way,
you locked the gate, right?

Fuck.
You didn't...

Come on.
Go with him on the gate.

Jesus.

Come on, guys.

Fucking amateur hour, right?

Look at that.
John Hancock and all.

I've gotta take care
of some things.

I'll see ya, yeah?

Take it easy.

All righty, man.

Lock the gate.

Yeah, yeah.

I always check the gate.

<i>Four years we've been here.</i>

Now, 40 bags unaccounted for.

I signed in for the full amount.
Yeah, we see you signed.

So where's the money?

Do you find this cool?

You find it acceptable
for guys to steal?

I didn't steal from you.

It's unacceptable.

Hey, 200 bags
at 10 bucks a pop.

That's 2,000 cash.

We don't take
product back here.

We take cash.

He's gonna show you the books.

Yo, maybe they
gave you a beat count.

How much you short?

I don't know.
Fifteen hundred.

Fuck.

You know, I could give you five, six,
but, you know, that's it.

Come on, let's go to the park,

get to work, you know?

No, no, I said I'm out.

I'll figure out a way
to get the money.

Hey, Mr. Willis,
how you doing?

You got a minute?

Yeah.

Let's chat, all right?

Step outside?

Yeah, you know, just smoke?

Sure.

Fixing myself
a little pick-me-up.

Yo, check it.

Huh?

Stole this from, uh,
my landlord's garage.

Need something
to cook with, you know?

The only way I'm gonna be able
to pay back this cash,

is if I work the park.

I'm only doing this
till I've got the money.

Showing a little
brief intelligence.

Yo, let me talk to Canarsie.

I'll work tonight
if you got anything to sell.

No.

Let me handle Canarsie.
He knows me better.

But, uh,

yeah, you can work
for me tonight.

This should help send you
on your road to recovery.

<i>¶ Squeezing her knees
We despise</i>

<i>¶ Blowing apart
Shaking her hair</i>

<i>¶ Fuck you The promised land ¶</i>

Makes you feel like

your lungs are expanding,

and you're breathing
mountain air.

That's right. Yeah.

Hey, you know, Dave, he...
He's all right.

What's your problem?
Huh?

He just walked in.
I'll call you back.

You were saying?

My boy, Dave, he's...
He's all right, yeah.

Yeah?
What was he doing at the bar?

A mistake.

Yeah, a mistake?

Been a lot of mistakes.

Come on. He's cool.
He's, you know...

He was talking to a cop.

Nah. Dave?
Yeah.

Now, come on,
he wouldn't do that.

I was there.

And then Canarsie said
that you said

that he was extremely
nervous at the bar.

Who told you to do
a fucking interview with a cop?

You were supposed
to be out of there.

It's taken care of, isn't it?

It's not taken care of!

I'll say when it's fucking taken
care of, you hear me?

When I say, not you.

Where's my money?
That's what I wanna know.

Where's my money?

He's working on it.
Mmm-hmm.

When am I gonna get
my two grand?

He's working on it.

He's doing shit.
I'll handle it.

Get the fuck out.

Get the fuck out.
Come on!

You make me sick.

Can't you borrow it?

From where, Mike?

Anywhere, fuck!

You keep fucking telling me

that everybody's
making fortunes,

so why are they hustling me
so much for two grand?

You want me
to tell you why, Davey?

You want me to tell you?

Because they think maybe
you're doing this deliberately.

What?

Yeah, they think maybe
you know too much.

You know. You're in a position to
take advantage of them.

Yeah, look, Davey, you gotta clear up
that cash and fast.

You gotta.

I'd help you, but I'm strapped.

Just meet me in the park
in a couple hours

and we'll work this out, okay?

Okay.

And, look, you gotta stop
talking to the cops.

I said nothing.

Fuck.

Hey, I'm glad you're here.

Come on.
Give me a hand.

This is the one thing your father
always used to do.

When he wasn't drunk?

Ah, come on,
don't start with me.

All I remember is him drunk on
the couch, cigarette burning.

I made a noise,
he'd be screaming.

He was your father.
He loved you.

You respect him no matter what.

Respect him? Ma, everybody
on the corner's

still making jokes about him,

saying he still owes them money,
my father.

We never had a day's peace.

People are still banging on the door,
threatening us.

I had to hand over
my mother's wedding ring.

Everything I had.

Hey, you pick that up.

I said pick it up.

Let's go.

Are you a rat?

I said, are you a rat?

I never snitched on nobody.

Mike...

Mike knows. Hey, tell him I never
snitched on nobody.

Yo, Mike, the fuck do you...

Honestly, I didn't say
a fucking thing, Mike.

Tell him I didn't say
a fucking thing.

I didn't talk to the police.
I didn't say a word.

Yo, Mike, say something, man.

Mike, say something.
You got...

You fucking say
something, Mike.

Don't just fucking sit there.

Yo, Canarsie,
I didn't do nothing.

I never said nothing.
I swear to God.

Yo, Mike, tell them.

Mike, you fucking
tell them I didn't say anything!

Please, I didn't say nothing!

Please!

Ah!

Get the fucking car
out of here.

Come on, go.

Fuck.

Die, you fucking rat.

Hey.

Hey.

Where did he go in?

Picked him up
near the fence there.

Let's take a look.

This is the, uh, kid from the bar
the other night.

I tried to talk to him.

I guess he didn't know how to stay
out of trouble.

Another dead body comes out
of this canal, huh?

All right.

Yes?

Are you Mrs. Willis?

I am.

I'm Detective Hogan
from the NYPD.

He was, unfortunately, killed.

Oh, God.

I keep feeling like this is a story
I'm watching on the news.

You're gonna get
through this, you know?

I'm right here.

Thank you for
being here for me.

You'd do the same for me,
are you kidding?

Come on.

You got to be strong.
You have two kids.

They're strong.
They're going to be okay.

Mrs. Willis, thanks
for coming in today.

Again, my condolences
for your loss.

Thank you.

You're sure you're
up for this today?

Yes.

This came in from
the medical examiner.

Born May 17, 1992.

Died November 8th.

I guess this is all you get.

Miss Willis, this type of crime
usually involves drugs,

and I'm a bit concerned

with the company your son kept.

What company are
you talking about?

My son was murdered.

Did you realize that we had him in
here for questioning two weeks ago?

No, he never
told me. What for?

He was a witness to a murder,

and we believed that he might be
protecting his friend.

Who? Why would
he do that?

What do you know about his
relationship with a Michael J. Vardi?

Michael?

They've known each other
since they were kids.

They worked together.
I never liked him.

I always thought
he was trouble.

We believe that Vardi
was part of a drug gang.

Do you know
anything about that?

No, of course not.

What does any of this
have to do with Dave?

That's what we're
trying to figure out.

Detective,
my son was a good kid.

You have to believe that.

Yeah. Listen, I know
this is difficult,

but if you remember anything,

no detail too small,
you give me a buzz, okay?

Oh, come on, honey.

Don't you have something
better to do?

Where's your brother?

Still sleeping.

12:00 on a Saturday?
He's late for football.

Mom, Bernard
doesn't want to go.

He told me he can't
face anybody.

I don't understand.

The kids at school
are saying mean stuff.

Well, they don't know
what they're saying.

Dave was not some criminal.

Bernard, you have to get up.

Bernard, you have to get up
and go to football!

Hey, Vardi, these guys
want to talk.

I already talked to them, boss.

How are you doing, Michael?
How are you feeling?

You don't, uh...
You don't look so good.

Gee, thanks, Detective.

I'd like to ask you again.

You say you never
saw Dave that night, is that right?

Just here.

How about after work?

Oh, see, I went home
and I went to bed.

You know, he didn't tell
me what he was doing.

That was it?

What do you want me to say?
I was in bed.

You know, it's funny. We found a gun
in the sewer out back.

The guy who came running in
right after the shooting

said he didn't see nobody
going out the front,

so what do you make of that?

I told you what
I saw, Detective.

You sure you weren't
out for a cigarette?

I'll get back to you.

Okay, okay, I get that,
but what about Vardi?

Have you questioned him?

Yeah, but he's not talking.

But don't worry, something's
gotta give. It always does, right?

It's not like these people are gonna
line up to chat with me.

That's it.
Hey, Mrs. Willis,

how are you? Okay.

Okay, thanks.

Ready?
It's time?

Yeah.

We gotta run.

Oh, good, where to?

Berryville.

Berryville?

Yeah, we're hunting.

Hunting?

Boom!

Is something up there?

Yeah, deer.

No, I mean with the case.
Who is in Berryville?

We are. We've got off
till Friday at 4:00.

Off? Why?

Because we're off.
Come on, let's go.

Listen, I'll call you when we
get back on Friday, okay?

Uh, um, can I just
use the bathroom?

It's the second door
on the left.

Ooh, these look pretty good.

Mmm-hmm.

Mmm... Come on, why don't
you leave it alone?

Give it a rest for a while.
No, I can't.

Why?
The police aren't doing anything to help me.

Yeah, but you're
not the police. Go on.

Wow.

Looky, looky.

Look at you.

It's because you're so hot.

Oh, yeah. Thanks.

Why don't you go spend that?

Hey, Rita!
Peg and I have decided

we're not gonna split our tips
with you anymore.

You're on your own.

Whatever, bitches.

Good girl, you're doing
your homework.

You going out, too?

Just for a little bit.
Keep the door locked.

What about dinner?

I'll bring home pizza.

Okay, pizza's fine.

I love you.

Love you, too.

They're fucking late.

Michael.

Fuck.

I gotta deal with this bitch
real quick, man.

Handle your business.

Need a lift?

No, you know, I'm good.

You sure?

Come on, get in.
It's raining.

Yeah, all right, why not?

What's up?
Ten for 90.

I never sleep.

I keep hearing Dave...

I keep hearing
Dave's voice crying out in the night.

He's begging for his life.

He keeps trying to tell me who
did this to him.

I fight really hard
to hear him,

but I just can't
quite make it out.

You were so close to him.

You must hear him.

Do you?

Do you hear him
crying out in the night?

Yeah, I gotta get in.

Why? What's your rush?

You know, I... I...
I didn't have a...

It's just a shame
I wasn't around, you know?

Yeah, why didn't you
come to his funeral?

You were his friend.

Yeah, I mean,
I wanted to, I just...

I was too upset, you know?

You sure you weren't,
I don't know, scared?

What?

Good night, Michael.

Oh, by the way,
hey, would you mind

giving me your
cell phone number?

You know, just in case
I ever need to call you.

My cell?
Uh, yeah, it's, uh...

917-289-0796.

Good night.

<i>Yeah, I mean, I...
I wanted to,</i>

<i>but, uh, I was too upset.</i>

<i>You sure you weren't,
I don't know, scared?</i>

Next time you
get a sleeve, all right?

Get outta here.

This shit's raw, all right?

What are you
doing here, old lady?

I wanna buy salts.

Well, there's a pharmacy
three blocks that way.

I wanna buy salts.

You a cop?

Is Mike here?
He'd sell to me.

Mike don't know
an old lady like you.

I was also a friend of Dave's.

I didn't like Dave.

Did you know I was the last one
to see him alive?

Really?

That's what's been said.

But Mike, really, was
the last one to see him.

I got things I gotta do.

Good luck.

Buy you a drink?

Don't worry.
I don't bite.

I'll have what you're having.
All right.

Can we get two shots
of Patron, please?

So, what's your name?

Big Tommy.
Big, Big Tommy.

What's yours?

Mary.

Mary.

I love that name.

<i>¶ Mary, Mary ¶</i>

Look what we have here, Mary.

Thank you very much,
sweetheart.

That's for you.
Bottom's up, Mary.

Here's to you, Big Tommy.

Mmm-hmm.

Ah. Whoo.

Who's the guy with the kid?

Ah. What's it
matter, honey?

Am I not what
you're looking for?

I'm a dynamo.

Who is he?

That's Blackie.

He's a wise guy.

Hangs out at the social club
on President Street.

You don't wanna talk to them.

Let's discuss our future.

Thanks for the drink.

Wait. What?

I gotta go.

I gotta pick up
my kid at school.

Next time it's on me,
Big Tommy.

Ah! Tsk!

Hey, sweetheart.

Hey!

What are you doing?
Huh?

What are you doing here?

Obviously you wanna see your son
quicker than you think.

Am I making you nervous?

You're not making me nervous.
You're giving me a pain.

Why don't you get the hell outta
here? You don't belong here.

I'm just drinking my coffee.

You better behave yourself,

'cause I don't
discriminate, okay?

Take your cell phone
and get the hell outta here,

if you know
what's good for you.

Detective Hogan,
so how's it going?

We had a cop killed from this
precinct over the weekend.

Yeah, I heard.
I'm sorry.

I thought maybe
there was a connection.

To what? Your son?

Yeah.

I have no idea. Right now my priority
is to catch a cop killer, okay?

Well, I understand.

Really?
I don't think you do,

'cause you keep waltzing in
here trying to stop everything

to figure out who killed your son,
the drug dealer.

Who the hell are you
to call my son a drug dealer?

We've got other
priorities right now.

Do you understand?

We've had a rough
couple of days.

Well, I'm sorry.

Look, what about this Blackie guy?
What's his connection?

Where did you get that from?

Around.

Look, I'm telling you,
stay away. Okay?

Especially from this Blackie.
You understand?

Well, does he have anything to do
with Dave's murder?

Ann, stop trying to play cop.

You're in way over your head.

Now go home,
take care of your kids.

They need you.

Excuse me,
are you Mrs. Grotze?

Yes.

Did you get
Detective Hogan's message?

Are you with the police?

I'm working this case.

I fell asleep
watching television

and so I got up
to take my medication

and I heard screeching tires
and I looked outside.

Yeah, I'm just gonna
tape this for our records.

A big truck bumped
into the light pole

and the driver jumped off.

Did you see what
he looked like?

A small guy with a hat.

Like those baseball caps
that the kids wear.

Yeah, uh-huh.

And then two other men
came from the canal.

Can you tell me anything else about
what the car looked like?

It was a big car, I remember,

but it was too dark to see
the color of the car.

And then I didn't know
the terrible thing that happened.

Right, well, thank you
very much, Mrs. Grotze,

we'll let you know
if we need anything else.

<i>Michael!</i>

<i>Michael!</i>

Is Detective Hogan in?

Ann, Ann, I really
need you now.

I know you gotta do this.
I need help, we got people.

Okay?

Still at court?

Okay. Can you tell him
that Ann Willis called?

Thank you.

What the hell
do I need him for?

Hey, Ann, can I have
a word with you?

Yeah, um, there were
a couple guys in here last night

asking about you
and, uh, frankly,

I don't think they were here
to ask you on a date.

Don't worry about it.

Seriously, these are
not nice guys.

Wise guys.

Can I help you with anything?
No.

You sure?

No, it's fine, I can take care of it.

Ann...

Michael. I was just
coming to see you.

I, uh... I'm heading out.

No, just go in
for a minute, please.

I'm just so upset
I don't know who to go to.

For what?

To find out
what's happened to Dave.

Look, you were his best friend.

Cops are useless,
you know that.

Look, can we please just
go inside for a minute?

I can't do this.

Michael, I've known
you a long time.

Come on. Please.

Please, let's just
go in for one minute.

All right, one minute,
and that's it.

You got a nice place here.

I bet you miss him.

I know I do.

Why don't you pour me a drink?

Thanks.

So, uh...

So?

What's this about?

Come on, talk to me, Michael.

About what?

About what happened to Dave.

Look, Mrs. Willis, you know,
I told you I, uh...

I don't know anything
about that.

Tell me something.

Is your car fixed?

Yeah.

What color is your car?

Uh, it's red.

Red.

Yeah.

That's a nice color.

I like black cars.

Like the black car you were in the
night that Dave was murdered.

Yo, you're crazy. I, uh...

No. No, I'm not.

You and Dave were picked up

in a big black car in the park,

and then somebody killed him.

I told you, I, uh...
I wasn't there.

I didn't kill Dave if that's
what you mean.

No.

No.
I know you didn't.

But, you see, I just wanna know
who did, so...

I had nothing to do with that.

Look, Dave, uh...
Dave screwed up, okay?

He owed big buck
and he couldn't pay.

Who couldn't he pay?

Listen, listen.

Dave was short
on product, okay?

He was short on product
and these things happen.

Then he, uh... He got beat.

All right? He got beat.

You see this?

This is from the pole
that the car hit.

What, uh...

What are you talking about?

You know, when
the headlight broke,

when the car hit the pole
when you were driving the car?

Whose car was it?
I know you were in it.

I saw your baseball cap.
No.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

Look, you text me
and you text me.

You gotta stop.

You gotta stop...

It's okay, Michael.

You told me everything
I need to know.

Just get it right
this time, Willy.

Pink, not red.

Hello?

Hello?

Who is this?

What do you want?

<i>How many kids you got left?</i>

<i>You wanna see another missing?</i>

Don't you threaten my children
when it's me you want.

Mike.

What up?

What you looking for, brother?

I need some shit for tonight.

Yeah, we can probably do that.

What's up?

What's good?

Chilling, chilling.

Michael, I want you
to listen to this.

What the fuck are you playing?
You know goddamn well what I'm playing!

Yo, man, get the fuck off of him!
Listen to your own shit.

You know what this is, Michael.
You listen to this.

Listen to this! You tell me who
murdered my son!

I don't know who
fucking killed Dave.

Your son was a fucking
loser just like you.

You listen to this!
You're a fucking loser!

You listen to this. You tell me
who murdered my son!

Fuck!

Little shit.
You little shit. You tell me!

I know you know
who killed my son, Michael!

Oh!

What the fuck you doing, bitch?

Fuck!

Fuck!

She's making me
nervous, you know?

I mean, she bothers me
fucking day and night, and she knows.

She fucking knows that...

You're one crazy little fuck,
you know that?

Things were perfect for you
till you brought

your little pussy friend in,
and now you're fucking up

and I can't have it.

You're supposed
to sell this shit,

not use it.

I'm cool, you know,
there's no problem.

There is from where
I'm standing.

Did you talk
to that Willis woman?

No, I just...

Look at me!

I didn't say nothing.
Did you?

I didn't say nothing.
I swear, nothing.

You better not have.

Fuck!

Hello? Hello?
Dave, is that you?

You fucking text and text
and text and text and text!

Fuck you.

Fuck you, you bitch!

Fuck. Fuck.

Fuck you! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

I thought I told you
to lay off Vardi.

I'm finished with him.

You're finished, huh?

When you get off work tomorrow,
go find me another witness, okay?

What are you talking about?

He OD'd.

He was our best shot.
You blew it.

Well, I couldn't wait for you.
I had to go talk to him.

Like you had to go
talk to Mrs. Grotze?

It was great going over there
after you were through.

Well, why was it my job
to get there first?

You keep it up. You got a real knack
for this line of work.

Now, listen to me,
I need three things.

The car, the people in the car,

and to place your son
in that car with those people.

It's that simple.
One, two, three.

I don't have those three things,
I don't have a case.

We don't figure out
who killed your son.

You understand?

Fine.

<i>Come on, you gotta stop
with this detective thing.</i>

This is dangerous, all right?

I mean, look at you.
Look at your hands.

You have to serve people.

Come on, stop this whole thing.
Why don't you just go...

Go get a manicure, all right?

I can't afford a manicure.

Well, I have a million certificates
my dumb boyfriend gave me.

You can have one,
all right? Come on.

Hi, may I help you?

Yeah, I have a gift certificate

for a manicure and a pedicure.

Okay, we'll call, please.

Okay.

This is good.

Excuse me, aren't you
Mr. Canarsie's wife?

Yeah. So?

My son used to work
for your husband.

I saw you once
outside the warehouse.

Oh, oh, that's nice.

I'm Ann Willis.

You picked the best day
to be here.

What does your boy do now?

His name's Dave.

He's dead.

Oh, my God.

I... I didn't realize
that the boy that...

Oh, my God, that is terrible.

First your boy
and then Mike Vardi.

He was a nice boy. He worked for my
husband for close to two years.

Didn't seem like he was cuckoo,

but then, whew, what he did...

My husband was very upset
about what happened.

My neighbor, Mrs. Finito,
she called when she heard

what happened to Mike
because he rented her garage.

I can't bring any of this up.

I can't talk to my husband about
anything these days.

Do you live
in the neighborhood?

No, I live over in Bay Ridge.

I have a cousin who lives
on 80th near Shore.

I'm on 68th between Shore
and Narrows.

Oh...

You know what?
I just remembered

I've gotta go pick up
my kids at school.

It was really nice meeting you.

Yeah, yeah, it was
nice meeting you, too.

And I'm really sorry
for your loss.

Excuse me, do you know
where Mrs. Finito lives?

Yes, three doors down.

Thank you so much.

Excuse me, are you Mrs. Finito?
Yeah, why?

Uh, I'm a friend
of Mr. Canarsie's.

He said that the car
was in the garage,

and I left something
in there a couple of weeks ago.

Oh, sure.

Thank you so much.

Take a look.

You mustn't have needed
your purse for a while.

This car's been
in here for months.

No, I forgot that
I spilled my purse

until I was looking
for my insurance card.

Oh. You see it?

No.

Um, I just remembered
I was in the back seat.

I remember when
I had my kidney problem,

those doctors won't
even look at you

without proof of insurance.

Any luck?

You got it?

No.

Ah, tough.

Thank you very much
for your time.

I really appreciate it.

Sure. Uh...

What's your name again?
Oh, shit.

Oh, no!

<i>Hi. This is Detective Hogan.</i>

<i>Please leave a message...</i>

Damn it.

I found the car.
I found it.

It's in a garage in Bay Ridge.

There's a piece of David's
jersey in the car.

<i>I'm heading to the warehouse.</i>

<i>I wanna look into the eyes
of the man who killed my son.</i>

Did you rat me out?

Huh? Did you rat me out,
you little fucking bitch?

Is that what you did?

I'm going to put you where
your son is. How about that?

Police! Put the gun down.
On the ground.

Don't move!

Down. Down.

I ought to lock you up,
you know that?

What, do you think
this is a game, huh?

They killed my son.

You didn't trust me.

Give me the phone.

Get outta here.

Dave, my sweet boy,

you brought so much joy,

love and light
into all of our lives.

We are grateful for the time
God shared you with us.

And we will carry you
in our hearts forever.

So now, my beloved son,
I return you to our heavenly father.

I pray that you are at peace.

I will love you forever. And you
will always be in our hearts.

I love you, Dave.

I miss you so much.

Ann.

Hi.

Hey.

I, uh, wanted to get
that back to you.

Thanks.

Maybe I'll...

Maybe I'll see you around.

Wouldn't that be nice?
