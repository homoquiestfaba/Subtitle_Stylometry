(Latin-flavored introduction
to "Dixie")

Yo, man. Miky, Miky...

?Yo... te estoy llamando...?

Hey, what's happening,
what's happening?

We'll just start from the top.

Well, I guess I started stealin'
when I was eight

milk and bread
for my baby sister and brother.

And other times,
just walking at the supermarket

just eating food right off
the aisles and not even paying.

We walk right outside, you know.

Now, when you think
of Latin writers,
you probably think

of Garcia Marquez

Neruda, Cortazar
and Magic Realism.

Not here... not this.

There are no
floating butterflies

around my head when I walk down
Avenue "B", you know?

This is street reality.

This is where we shout it out.

¿Tu sabes?

?Tierra va temblar, Santiago?

?Tierra va temblar,
Camaguay?

?Que no me llore,
que no me llore?

?Mira, Monina?

?Negrona linda...?

?Get out of my way?

? Ugly woman ?

?Get out of my way?

? You're not here to stay ?

?Get out of my way?

? Yes, I know you, baby ?

?Get out of my way?

? You got to get out
of my way ?

?Get out of my way?

? Ugly woman ?

?Get out of my way?

? Get out of my way,
pretty babe ?

?Get out of my way?

? Yeah, baby, you make it ?

?Get out of my way?

? You got to get out
of my way. ?

PINERO:
All right, check it out,
check it out, check it out.

Black woman with
a blonde wig on:

can you imagine yourself
onTo Tell the Truth

with three blondes
on blonde.

Free... slave...
black... 21.

If I have one life
to live

let me live it
as a blonde.

Black woman with
a blonde wig on.


You wrote that shit?

Well, yeah.

That's some pretty good shit,
man.

You know, if I was you

I would get with that dude,
uh, Marvin

with the writing program, man.

Yeah, yeah, I mean,
if I had your talent

I definitely
would.

Yeah?

Get you out of here.

At least, I won't
have to sleep

with my hand covering
my ass tonight.

Not tonight.

Man, I got to get
the hell out of here.

Just keep writing, bro.

Motherfuckers don't fuck
with entertainment.

Miguel Pinero... 150614.

Yeah, can I say something

before I get started?

I'd just like to thank
the parole board

for letting me express myself

here today, and I leave it

to your good conscience

to consider my release,
and hopefully soon.

Jesus Christ! I'm trying to
do you a favor... it's a steal.

No, I ain't saying
you steal it.

I stole it to sell it
to you at a steal.

Go ahead, check it out.

Go ahead,mira.

I'm not going to bite you.

Go ahead.

A Bulova for $20.


Fuck... if I wasn't sick...

See, I'm Malo the Merchant.

Nowmaloin Spanish
means "bad."

Not "bad" as in "bad,"
but "bad" as in "good."

And I'm so good,
it's terrible.

I'm bad. Can you dig it?

Five years for stealing?

Why would you want
to steal

when you got it all, Miky?

You have no idea how many times
I've asked myself

"What are we doing here?

Why did we leave Puerto Rico?"

To become doormen and waiters
and junkies and supers

dope dealers, pimps,
welfare parasites.

The fact is...

I am the cause
for the state's great concern

with drugs nowadays.

When they came to me,
I got it for them.

Now, they say that dope

is destroying the youth
of our nation.

Well, not my nation,
their nation

'cause for years it
had been destroying our nation

and no one gave a good fuck
about it.

Speak with your eyes,
look with your mouth

and you'll be okay.

When are we going
to yell out

"No more fucking dope, man!"

You are surprised that I,

a dope fiend, would make
such a distinction

between me and my peers?

But you see...
the time before this

there was the time
before that

and that's where I live,
in the time before this.

The day we left Puerto Rico

I remember
my grandmother crying

trying to pull me back.

It was like she knew
something bad

was gonna happen.

Can you dig that?

(trumpet playing piercing
jazz riff)

(siren blaring
in distance)

WOMAN:
Who is it?

It's me. Miky.

You alone?

No, I'm with myself.

Just call me Monty Hall

and let's make a deal.

All right, check it out.
Check it out.

It's an expensive watch.

Cheap.

Cheaper than cheap.

In fact, it's so cheap

that if I sell it you
any cheaper

you'll be stealing it from me,
¿tu sabes?

The poetry man.

You got some shit
with you, bro.

Mira, Pani.Al Pacino wore
this watch inSerpico.

Yeah, right.

For real, bro.
I swear to God.

Now, listen, man,
let me see it there.

Man, that watch
don't work, man.

It's all right, bro.

You don't need to know
the time all the time.

In fact, you'll live longer
with a watch that don't work,
¿tu sabes?

Check it out.

You got some
pair ofbolas.

You know that shit, man?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Mira, Pablito,you
 don't look so good.

You got a little money for me?

I'm shy about three
dollars-- here.
Oh, man!

I'll pay you next
Tuesday, all right?

Man, you something else.

Always doing
the same thing, man.

I ain't doing it
next time.

I'll pay you next
week, all right?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Same story.

You know, Doctor, I spent
my whole life living like

there's no sickness,
no dying, no nothing.

So, now the clock is ticking.

I don't know, all of a sudden
I feel kind of corny.

You know?

It's your liver
saying "enough."

I'm really sorry.

So, what? Six months?

Ah... I don't know.

The way you live, who knows?

You know, my best friend Tito,
he died two days ago.

Got crushed by an icebox.

He never saw it coming,
you know?

I guess I'm not that bad off,
you know?

(siren blaring in distance)

MIKY:
Hello, Professor!

I got Cabernet 1967

Duck mousse a la port,
garlic crisps

theNational Book Review

and the latest copy
ofScrew-- What else?

Cuchifritos.
Let's celebrate.

What are we celebrating?

Life, baby. Life.

Shit, I don't care
what the doctors say, man.

Worst case scenario,
not a bad life.

Don Johnson, that's
a pretty motherfucker.

Mm-hmm.

Check this out.

Remember that night
at Burroughs bunker?

I asked him
where the bathroom was.

He said, "It's right over there.

Come on, I'll
pee with you."

(both chuckle)

Rich fucker.

Me, 40 years old,
maybe $40 in the bank

homeless, no kids.

Thank God for that.

Me, 20 years teaching
Shakespeare at Rutgers.

A lifer.

You think that Shakespeare
ever met a Puerto Rican?

Well, if he did

I could have been
in one of his plays.

Check this out.

Friends, Puerto Ricenos,
countrymen

lend me your ears
and hand me a beer.

I come to bury Miky,
not to praise him.

The evil that men do
lives after them.

The good is oft interred

with their bones.

So, let it be with Miky.


Check that out.


Damn.

You know, lately

I forget every wonderful thing
I want to remember.

(clears throat)

Things like... things
that happen when you're...

you're in a cab or...
at the doctor, or...

just walking
and watching.

Because that's all you
could afford emotionally.

And you say, "I'm going
to remember this

and place it where it fits."

But I don't know about you,
but I always forget them

you know?

(quiet laugh)

Man, look at this.

Look at Tito.

Nuyorican Poets!

Man, I will never forget
that night.

Of course not.

Because I told you
what happened.

I'm your memory.

I got a full house
and a baby waiting to be born.


You told him how
important this was?

Of course I did

but that doesn't jive with him.

Put my neck on
the chopping block

to make this happen.

Joe, would you just
calm yourself down?

He's going to be here.

He-he's probably
just nervous, you know?

He's standing somewhere
watching us right now.

(smooth Latin music playing)

Hello.

My name is Joe Papp.

Good evening, ladies.

May we have your attention?

We're your tour guide.
We're with the city.

Check this out,
check this out!

Five, six,
seven, eight!

I met Miguel Pinero

shortly after his release
from Sing Sing...

Take off your shit!

What are you doing?

...where, for the past year,
he found the courage

to write and develop
a play calledShort Eyes

about the very place
where he was living.

Let go, let go, let go!

Go, go, go!Vaya!

All dramatists of real value

must sooner or later confront
what, for themselves, is...

truly dangerous.

Taxi.

Now we are proud to present
to you,Short Eyes.

Go. You do that
very well.

You know, this is
the best thing

that could happen to us.

I think so.

Really.

I mean, we are less now.

We'll eat more.

Hey...

we'll go to dancing

we will swim in
the Hudson River

we will read poetry,
we will go to movies...

(voice fades out,
haunting music fades in)

(no audio)

OFFICER:
Name?

Miguel Pinero.

What do you do
for a living?

I'm a writer, poet, reporter.

Really?

And a thief, a junkie

or whatever else one has to be
sometimes.

You know how it is.

OFFICER:
And you?

Tito. Tito Goya.

And you?


Hey, that's Goya
for the beans,
not the painter.

If it's Goya it's got
to be good,¿tu sabes?

Charley!

You owe me three packs, man!

Off the fucking noise!

Now, if I have to call
your name more than once, pray

'cause your soul
may belong to God

but your ass is mine.

Yeah, and your brain may belong
to the state

but your sanity belongs to me.

(no audio)

(can clanking)

Fuck.

Profe?

Professor? You around?

PINERO:
Hey,mira,brother man.

You want to buy a brand-new TV?

I just liberated it.

$35, all right?

I got medical bills.

I got to buy me
a new liver.

Tutu, you want
to buy a TV?

It's brand-new.

Shit, that thing
has a broken antenna.

Oh, no, look, Tutu--
it ain't broken.

It's just a short one,
so it don't get in the way

and shit like that, you dig?

We need one
for the bathroom anyway.

Hey, man,
that's cool.

That way you don't
miss out on the soap opera

when you're taking
a shit,¿tu sabes?

That's funny, man--
why don't you talk

that foul fucking
language somewhere else?

Yeah, like, be cool,
motherfucker.

The trouble with our love
is here.

Our love is around.

It's around...

Maybe the next time
you break in

I should
call the police.

Maybe.

Hi, I'm Sugar.

I'm Miky's woman.

I'm out here
hustling for Miky

trying to make a livin',
doing the best that I can

for my man.

Daddy hit me again.

Ma, can you hear me?

It's me, your baby.

He was drunk.

I know, I know--

he ain't my real dad.

But every time

you go to sleep,
he comes into my room

and he sits on my bed

and he starts touching my leg.

He scares me when
he's like that.

I know, I know--
the food, the landlord.

Where are you?

You said you'd be
around if I needed you

and I need you, Ma.

Ma, they call me Tricky now

'cause I've turned more tricks
in one night

than you turned in a lifetime.

Ma, please help me.

I'm tired of turning tricks.

I want a kick.

I want a fix.

I want you to need me.

I want you to need.

I want you to need me.

Cirrhosis.

Sounds like a fucking
flower, doesn't it?

I got to draw up a will.

So I figured, you know,
if we were married

you'd be the sole beneficiary
of my estate.

State of what?

State of mind?

You want to reward me
by making me a widow?

Believe it or not

there are some benefits

that come to you
by being married to me

that I want you to have

you know what I mean?

(siren wails in distance)

Do you think I like what I do?

It's acting.

You always said
I couldn't act.

Impossible.

You're impossible.

What am I going to do
with you, huh?

What are you talking about?

You know what I'm talking about.

What if something
happens to you?

I get scared too, Miky.

Look, I understand
if you don't want to marry me.

I mean, I wouldn't either.

"April 6, 1988.

You are hereby required
to blah, blah, blah..."

Shit.

Battery's dead, man.
What?

You left the fucking
radio on all night! Shit!

Dead battery?

What is this, an omen?

Miky, this ain't no omen.

This is my van, man.

Look, if you're going
to room with me, Miky

you got to respect
my space, man. Shit!

This motherfucker
ain't subsidized.

Probably won't even
pass inspection now

the way we going.

And neither will we.

PINERO:
How are you
going to have

Robert De Niro,
Ralph Macchio and Burt Young

playing Puerto Ricans
in a new play?

I don't want
to see that.

I don't want to see that.

I don't want you
around here.

Another Latino boom
is on the way

this time with Italians
playing us, bro.

Out! Get over here.

Come here.

This is a public
theater, right?

Yes, it is.

I thought this was
the Public Theater!

Itisthe Public Theater.

I'm part of the
public, you see.

I don't need
this shit, bro.

Don't be treating me
like that, man.

I see how it is.

If you got to see Ray,
you call him

but you do not come by,
you understand?

You let me down. You let me down
for the last time.

Oh, so what, now
you lost faith in me?

Of course not. I lost money.

Look, Joe, I'm sorry,
but I wrote this shit.

If you didn't like it,
that's not my problem.

You wrote the shit? No.

You wrote shit nothing.
Not a word.

You made me look bad.

I'm your last friend,
remember?

You said that.

Well, it be's that way
sometimes, bro.

Fuck you.

Fuck you, man.

Fuck you, fuck you, man!
Fuck you!

So what, now you got
Ray up in there

fulfilling your quota

for whore of the month
Latino life, huh?

I don't owe you shit.

I work for my commission,
motherfucker. Yeah.

What happened to you, Miguel?

Do you know?

Do you know?

Ray.

What's going on?

I love this man.

I know that.

(siren wails in distance)

It's okay, bro.

Don't worry about it.

Shit, nobody ever plays fair

when it comes
to the heart or the pocketbook.

I've been there.

No. No. No.
Yes. Yes. Yes.

RAY:
I love you, Miky...

but I got to agree with Papp,
you know?

De Niro's a box office draw.

I told Papp that I wanted you
to play my father

but you know how it is.

My man Bobby, he has clout.

He fell in love with the part.

Bobby?

Oh, yeah, Bobby.

You know I love you, Ray,
and all that shit, man

but sometimes you come across
like bad medicine

like a fucking laxative,
you know what I mean?

Hold me up.

Come on, hold me up.
Shit.

You are
very talented, Ray--

of course,
with my talent.

What the fuck's
this story about?

Whale-hunting,
offshore Korea.

Man, how you come up
with this foreign nonsense?

You've never seen
a fucking whale in your life

and you ain't no Korean.

You didn't have
to do that!

Well, you wanted me
to teach you, right?

Yeah, but not like this.

I'm not one
of your little boys

you just throw
in the water

and make me
learn how to swim.

Well, it be's that way
sometimes, bro.

You trying to fuck with me?

Fuck you, man.

Oh, so what,
now you're going

to hit me with
the chair? Come on.

You better hit me hard

because if you lay me out
and I get back up

I'm going to throw your ass
off this fucking roof.

Write about that.

You know, write
about what you
know, all right?

Write about that.

Write about your mother,
your father.

You got 20 stories
floating around

inside your stomach--
spit 'em out.

And how am I just supposed
to just "spit 'em out"

right?

Well, sweetie, I'm not going

to stick my finger down
your throat so you can puke.

And, by the way...

go buy yourself a
Smith Corona electric

'cause I can't
read your writing.

Take it.

Now, sit down,
smoke a joint.

So I gave you my ass.

What else you want,Papi?

Hmm? You want to grade
my fucking work?

Okay.

You're God.

Right...

Oh, man, what's going
on, because one day

you're happy, you know,
you're proud of me.

Now you're, uh, you know,
you're in a rage...

'causeI'mdoing good.

Excuse me.

I'm not me.

Excuse me.

Deadlines, man.
Come on.

Sentence passed, if
you catch my drift.

You look familiar.

Which one of you
are you today?

Actually, that's
why I came.

Come on. I got a
residual check
fromKojak.

They're running
the show in Africa.

I'm sorry, all right?

It was just a case of
nerves,Profe.Here.

Come on, it's not like I'm
going to be around forever.

You fucking
button-pushing

manipulating ingrate,
whose latest heartfelt con

is your death, because,
after all, you're the only

fucking person dying
in this world

because death
was designed

just for you, right?

(men yelling)

I don't want to die, Daddy!

Shit! I should take
that bouncing check

and welcome you back

to my home so that
in the eventuality

that I accidentally
shove a finger up your ass

you might squeeze
my mother's wedding band--

which I am wearing--
out of it, right?

Look, bandito, this
shit has to stop.

Anybody can be a poet
the way you live.

Fuck it!
I could write like you

if I didn't have to worry
about working

and sleeping or paying the rent.

I know, I know,Profe.

I know, and I'm sorry.

I do abuse you of your kindness
and humanity and shit.

Humanity.
That's the word, Miguel.
That's it.

Put that shit away.
Put that shit away.

PINERO:
I can't help it, you know.
You're a nice guy.

Look, I want to read to you...

Tito.

All right, let me read you
how I figured out

that last act forThe Sun
Always Shines for the Cool.

I heard it.
The whole building heard it.

The fucking neighborhood
heard it.

All right then.
I'll leave, you know.

I'll just leave.

Leave? Where the fuck
are you going to go

at 4:00 in the morning

where you won't
get arrested

for carrying around a
stolen-from-me Smith Corona?

I got an idea.

Now, I will rent this place

not for your benefit,
but for mine

so I can sleep,
so I can keep my job

so I can preserve my sanity
and write like you.

Welcome to our house!

The Nuyorican Poets Cafe.

Ha-ha!

What do you think, baby?

What do you think?

Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

Miguel Algarin and Tito Goya
welcome Miguel Pinero

back from the filming of another
movie in Hollywood.

Vaya!

(combo playing Latin jazz)

(melancholy melody
fades in)

(melody continues)

(lively jazz playing)

Uh...

appreciate all the nice things

my friends can still say
about me, you dig?

But no speeches from me tonight,
uh...

I wrote this poem on the plane.

It goes, uh...

Dreamt I was a poet and writing
silver sailing songs.

Words strong and powerful

crashing through walls
of steel and concrete

erected in minds weak
and those asleep

replacing a hobby of paper
candy wrapping collecting potent

to pregnant sterile
young thoughts.

I dreamt I was thispoeta

words glittering bright and bold

striking a new rush
for gold inlas bodegas

where our poets' words
and songs are sung

but sunlight stealing
through venetian blinds

eyes hating, working of time

clock sweating and swearing
and slaving for the final dime

running a maze, a token ride.

Perspiration
insulting poets' pride

words stopping on red,
going on green...

poets dreams ending
in afactoria

as one-in-a-million unseen,
buying bodega sold dreams.

(applause and cheers)

WOMAN:
Miky! All right!

Hey.

Remember me?

Maybe.

Excuse me.

Gee, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

What the fuck you give me--
elephant tranquilizer?

What day is it?

And do you have any more?


Shit.

Relax,Papi.

We've been
in this bed for hours.

What's the matter, huh?

Is it too hot
to get it up?

'Cause I can dig
a little tongue

but too much of
it makes me horny.

You can't be out here
giving up all this tongue

if you can't give
up anything else.

So... relax.

Shit, if I relax any more,
I'm going to faint.

So, what...
you rehearse that speech?

I did.

But you wrote it.

(mellow Latin jazz playing)


Yeah.

The Sun Always Shines
for the Cool.

Great play.

That's right.

So you want to be

an actress, huh?

Yeah. I've read
everything
you've written.

Twice.

I'm flattered.

So am I.

Twice, huh?

Yeah.

I guess it's true
what they say about jail.

What's with you?

Little boys?

Shit, I'd
like to watch.

Hey,Papi,
what's the matter?

Huh?

Oh, man, I was just kidding.

Look, why the fuck
you come here for, huh?

Between insulting me

and getting yourself
worked up to be near me

you lost me.

I thought that...

Oh, forget it.
Just get out of here.

Oh, come on, Miky.

Just get the fuck
out of here!

I'm sorry, okay?
Get out of here!

I'm just nervous.

I'm sorry, Miky.

I didn't mean it.

You know how long
I've been waiting for this?

You like me so much
it makes me nervous.

Since the first time
I saw you

in the projects... and the rest
of how that shit goes

I knew you, Miky.

You had no father.

I had too much of one.

I said to myself...

"Between me and him...

we make one happy child."

Come on.

Everyone's a fucking
poet tonight, huh?

Maybe. And I'll
suck your cock

like a fucking poem,
whatever that makes me.

Whatever you want,
Miky, I'll do it.

I'm your whore.

(mellow jazz playing)

He comes into my room...

and he sits on my bed.

He scares me
when he's like that...

his hands touching me.


All hard and
fast and hot

his spit falling
all over me...

MOTHER:
Miky!

Get out of here!

Get...! You get out...!

Get the fuck
out of here!

(door slam echoing)

The last time
you had a job

you were hired at
9:00 in the morning

by 11:00 you were fired.

That was two years ago.

So what,
are you a detective now?

Worse.

I'm your mother.

You just got out of jail,
now you're back inside.

Miky...

didn't you learn
anything good

the first time?

You mean besides acquiring
my first drug habit?

Don't talk to me
like that.

It's just that...


I am tired of visiting
my son behind bars.

It's the only time
we get to talk.

I mean, what happened
to that son I used to have?

The little boy who would
bring me flowers

who would write poems for me?

I think, in your mind

our life had been like
Leave it to Beaver.

But in my mind,
it was different.

I'm sorry.

You know, I'm sorry
for my anti-social behavior.

It's not a choice.


What do you want me to do?

Make me proud before I go.

What, are you
in a hurry today?

No.

You're talking with your eyes.

Okay...

Okay, Mama.

I'll make you proud.

I'll make you proud of me,
you'll see.

You'll see.

I'll make you proud of me.

I got this picture
of Jane Fonda...

so I would

really stretch out...

doing up my wood.

No, no, man,
say it natural.

Not like a minister.

Say it like you,
like here

like Edgar.

Don't try to sound
all like Corinthian

Ricardo Montalban Cordova dude.

Give me you, the life, Harlem.

Talk like you talk,
you know?

Be all the nigger that you are.

Did you say "nigger"?

Nigger.

Wesson oil

never had it so good.

You see, I got this picture

of Jane Fonda.

She got this black
silk satin bikini.

Yeah, you dig?

So I strips naked, right.

And I starts to roll and roll?

I mean, I am whipping my Johnson
Ronson to the bone, boy!

Ooh, yeah.

Soon...

everybody on the tier
knew that I was working out...


'cause soon,
everybody's voice was with me.

I starts... I starts
calling out her name

real soft, you know?

? Janey ?


? Janey, baby... ?

Oh, get it, Janey, oh!

Just a little louder, baby.
Ooh, faster.

I scream. Oh!
My knees buckle. Oh!

Oh, Janey, baby.
Get it, baby.

Get it.

Get it, get it, get
it, get it, get it.

Oh, Janey!

Oh... ooh...

Ah...


Now that's black power.

That's it!

That's how we do it!

Now you're an actor.

You ain't Bowser anymore--
44-756 armed robbery rap.

No, man, not
while you're acting.

You Ice, leading man
inShort Eyes.

(Latin-flavored rhythms
playing, vocalist improvising)

PINERO:
Well, when you're in prison,
you're nowhere being nobody.

You're a number, you know?

So when I started writing
my poetry and acting

I felt like somebody
in the land of nothing.

I never felt so alive.
I never had so much energy.

I go back to my cell,
I'd create something.

(Latin rhythms continue)

I spoke to this movie
director this afternoon

who's very much interested in
making a film ofShort Eyes.

I mean, there's Lumet,
there's Pacino...

and, I mean, basically
everybody in this town

they love you.

And I can get you
the best possible deal.

Uh, Rob?

Yes?

Rob, is it?
Yeah.

So you want to be my pimp?

Is that it, you want
to pimp me out?

Yes.

Yes, very much so.

I would love that.

REPORTER:
Well, you must be feeling

really good tonight,
Mr. Pinero.

Your play,Short Eyes,
created a lot of controversy

a lot of opposition

and still you won
six nominations.

It's the first time
a Puerto Rican playwright

cleans up at the Tonys.

Cleans up?

At the Tonys, yes,
but, you know

we have been cleaning up
and down in this town

since theMarine Tigerdocked,
you know, in your offices

your restaurants,
the fine hotels.

Later on, we were cleaned up
in Korea, then Vietnam.

But when it came to the writing

we'd go chisel the motherfucker
straight out of beer cans--

the tar, the concrete of the
city-- the roots of the city.

You know, the metaphors
will flow from there.

But-- check it out--
no windows tonight.

This is our time.

(music and vocals continue)

It's not like we go into
the homes of the rich

and we walk out with
the silver ashtray, no.

We got in and we walk out
with something better--

their attention.

We take them to a world
they used to fear.

And we tell them,
hey, it's cool.

We used to fear you, too, man.

(trumpet playing
melancholy jazz solo)


This is our time.

Yeah.

Hey, check this out.

I know this is going
to be kind of sappy
and out of character

but with you,
I can be sappy and
out of character.

Yeah, right.

You must think of me
like some kind of

senile grandmother
or something.

But you got a promise
me one thing,Profe...

that, by tomorrow night

you'll come back to me with
a poem that lays out in detail

what's to be done
in case you or I die.

Excuse me?

Nothing's wrong.

You know, it's just a pact
here-- you know, a promise--

in case we caught
with our pants down.

Just humor me.

You want me to write a poem

about the details
of our funerals?

Yeah.

Yeah, so you write what you
want, I'll write what I want--

you know, like a testament--

and, uh, whoever goes first--
God forbid, it's you or me--

got to do what the poem says.

You're not planning
anything funny?

Algarin... what?

Now that we got the city
by the balls?

Watch out.

? Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey ?

?Mete la mano
en el bolsillo?

?Saca ya tu cuchillo
y ten cuidado?

? Oh, yeah,ten cuidado?

?Pongame o?do en
este barrio loco lo mataron?

?Y que mucho lo han matado?

?Calle luna, calle sol?

?A donde?

?Calle luna, calle sol...?

I'm here.

BODEGA MAN:
Miky.

You needed $5,000,
I got you $5,000.

Ain't nobody going
to shut you down.

Look, it's only money.

As legit as Hollywood
money can be

but... you pay
me back, cool.

If you can't pay
me back, no problem.

Okay?Vaya.

I look at it this way.

You know, I come in tomorrow

if I'm broke, you
give me a six-pack

we call it even, okay?

He was dead.

He never lived. He died.

Died.

He died seekin' the cause.

Because he said
he never saw the cause

but he heard the cause.

Heard the crying
of hungry ghetto children.

Heard the warning from Malcolm.

Heard the tractors
pave new routes to new prisons.

He died seekin' a cause,
seekin'acause.

He was already dead.

He never really lived.

Uptown, downtown, crosstown

his body was found
all over town seekin' the cause.

Thinking the cause
was $75 and gator shoes.

Thinking the cause
was selling the white lady

to black children.

Thinking the cause was to
be found in Gypsy Rose or J.B.

or singing doo-wops in the park
after some chiba-chiba.

(humming doo-wop)

He died.

He died seekin' the cause.

And the cause
was dying seekin' him.

And the cause was dying
seekin' him.

And the cause was dying
seekin' him.

He wanted a color TV.

He wanted a silk-on-silk suit.

He wanted the cause
to come up like the Mets

and take the World Series.

He wanted, he wanted,
he wanted, he wanted.

He wanted to want more wants

but he never gave,
he never gave.

He never gave.

He never gave his love
to his children.

He never gave
his heart to his people

and never did he ever
give his soul to his people.

He never gave his soul
to his people

because he was busy
seekin' a cause.

Busy...
busy perfecting his voice

to harmonize the national anthem

with Spiro T. Agnew.

Busy perfecting his jive talk

so that his flunkiness
wouldn't show.

Busy perfecting his
viva la policiaspeech.

Downtown, uptown, midtown,
crosstown.

His body was found
all over town.

Found in the part of fields
of an O.D.

Find in the bowery
with the DDTs.

His legs were left in Vietnam.

His arms
were found in Sing Sing.

His scalp was on Nixon's belt.

His blood painted the streets
of the ghetto.

His eyes were still looking
for Jesus

to come down on some cloud
and make everything okay.

When Jesus died in Attica

his brains plastered all around
the frames of the Pentagon

his voice still yelling
"Stars and stripes forever"

riddled with the police bullets
his taxes bought.

He died seekin' a cause.

Died seekin'acause.

He died yesterday.

He's dying today.
He's dead tomorrow.

He died seekin' a cause

and the cause
was in front of him.

And the cause was in his speech.

And the cause was in his skin.

And the cause was in his blood.

But he died.

He died seekin' a cause.

Seekin'acause.

He died deaf, dumb and blind.

He died and never found
his cause, because, you see

he never, never knew
that he was the cause.

(hums doo-wop phrase
in falsetto voice)

(Brazilian samba music
continues playing)

(samba music continues)

What's happening?

What's the matter with you, man?

Oh, just a little
oppression

on the right side
of the rib cage.

It's called an
exploding liver.

Kind of like a
standing ovation

organs give to
graduating chemicals.

What you want, man?

A liver. I need a liver.

A lover?

A liver.

I need a fucking
liver, bro.

Look, man, I can get
you crack, smack, weed...

but no liver, bro.

You fucking with me, or what?

I'm sick.

I need a liver.

I got to find someone
who's got a liver

compatible with mines.

You mean that fits?

Look, bro, I need
cash or a liver

or something
for real, brother.

I heard of some dude
who got this kidney for Jackie

this singer uptown.

He used to be with the O'Jays.

But a liver?

Look, just don't talk
that liver shit

around this chick.

(knock on window)

I sold you as someone creative.

Remember...

ten percent for me,
whatever you write.

This the chick?

That's the one.

I'd like to introduce you all

to a personality we have
in the house tonight with us.

Noel Pinero.

Where are you, baby?

Aye. There you go.

Look at that famous,
fabulous face.

Show time, baby.

(lively electronic
music plays)

? I am the first girl
on the moon ?

? Look... at me float ?

? I am a fire girl ?

? Give it to me, baby ?

? Oh... oh... oh... ?

? Look at me now. ?

I do fashion, you know.

With your connections
and my looks

God knows.

Jake says you're famous.

What are you
famous for, honey?

Tell Cuqui.

Tell Cuqui.

Wait a minute.

You... you want me
to write you a play?

Yes. You like to,Papi?

I think I'd like something...

fun...

with humanity...

and sexy.

Yeah. I like that.

I like that.

Mira,Mommy, writing
is like half inspiration

half inhalation.

What?!

¿Tu sabes?


Now, for a writer
like my stature

to collaborate with an actress
of your caliber

there has to be
a bond,¿tu sabes?

What blood type are you?

Blood type?

Are you a vampire,Papi?

Yeah.


That's money.

You're throwing away
money, baby.

I want some, too.

Look, I think you
better go, Noel.

Just go
before something...

Before, before, before what?
Before what?

You asked me up here.

Shit, you ain't even
got my name right

and you at the end
of the chapter.

You know what I should do?
You know what I should do?

Yeah. Go on.

Hit me.

Hit me.

Go for it, baby.

I know that's
what you want.

'Cause you have been
this and that.

Well, let's face the facts,
honey.

You are a loser.

And the only thing

that you're leaving with
here tonight

is the satisfaction of having
physically beat a woman.

Listen to me, woman.

You know what I'm going to do?

You know what you can do for me?
Do you?

Do you?

Do you know?

I'm going to take your liver.

Yeah.

That's right.

I'm going to come to you
at night

when you're sleeping.

I'm going to cut your
fucking liver out.

That's what I'm going
to write about.

That's what
I'm going to write about.

I'm going to take
your fucking liver, yeah.

Get the fuck
out of here!

Get out before I call
the police, you fucking freak.

They'll get here so fast
you won't even make it

to the lobby, eh?

Let's see who's the man.

Come on, you son of a bitch!
I'll slice you, motherfucker.


Beautiful.

Okay, fine, I've
burned every bridge

and I can't fucking
walk my way back

to the Writer's Guild
Pension and fuckfare

but it don't mean
I got to go

like I was never around.

It's not going
to happen, Miky.

I live, you live.

I don't even know
who owns what, right?

I mean, I try to call my agent
and he's, like

he fucking died before me.

I thought you were
leaving it all to Sugar.

Or the IRS--
motherfuckers.

They come and get you
between the fucking flames

with an asbestos suit
and a hose.

MAN:
This country has never made me
so blue

that I want to be red

so don't call me a Puerto Rican.

I'm an American.

Oh, God, no.
What is it?

What is that? What is this?

Excuse me?

The fight...
I don't think you've developed

any real conflict
or anything, you know?

I'm sorry.

Uh, who the fuck are you?

I just came to the workshop
because I like your work.

I'm your fan, man.
That's who the fuck I am.

My fan?

(actor snickering)

And I want
to be a writer

and I'm right.

That's right.

If you could only
give yourself a second

to maybe think you're wrong

and even if you don't,
I'm still right.

My name is Reinaldo Povad.

Kind of odd, sounds like... God.

(dance music playing)

PINERO:
That's why I gave up
the mugging business, right?

All these dumb movies
about men and women

taking the law
into their own hands.

I mean, it gets to be
you pull a knife on someone

everyone, you know, they've been
taking up karate-this

and kung-fu-that lessons.

Dude starts to think he's like
Bruce Lee's second cousin.

You got to stab him
in self-defense, right?

Povad-- what kind
of Puerto Rican name is that?

Russian.

My grandmother.

What do you think
of the girl?

She turning you on?

Not my type.

She's my mother.

No joke, man.

? We got to get over the hump ?

? We got get over the hump,
right now... ?

Nice tits, huh?

Beautiful tits.

? Turn me loose... ?

(fusion music playing)

So I busted the key
in the door

and I stepped
into Blackie's dog shit

and I wiped it off
with Junior's baby diaper

and that was full of baby shit.

So while relaxing,
I told Gloria

of all the shit
I had been through

and she said that
I was full of shit.

I said I wasn't bullshitting.

She said I wasn't shit.

I said that I don't want
to hear no shit.

She said I still wasn't shit.

So I grabbed her
by the fucking neck

and I pulled her ass
across the kitchen table

and she went flying
across the living room table

and over the underpaid,
overpriced furniture

and landed on
the overworked bed.

And I jumped into the air

and with the scream

of an Apache warrior's cry
of battle, I kill, kill, killed

all my troubles away.

(fusion music continues)

?  ?


How was that?
Was that good?

That felt real.
That felt real.

Hey, what are you
doing tonight, anyway?

Why don't you come on up?

Maybe you'll get lucky
and I'll fall in love with you.

Hey, here's
your call sheet.

Sure you don't want
to come up?

I'm positive.
Good night, Miky.

And don't forget
your wardrobe.

Miguel.

Papi?

Man, so good
to see you.

But what took you
so fucking long

to come back here?

I wanted...
I wanted to tell you...

What's it been,
like, 16 years?

You got a nice place here.

I'm glad you've done
so well for yourself.

When... your mother
and I split up...

You mean when you left
my mother

to take care of five kids
all by herself?

Huh?

Yeah.

You know, I had this dream
that someday

you and she would take five
off your daily fights

and offer me a sign of peace.

Yeah, I had that wonderful dream
so many times it...

it became like a fucking rerun.

It isn't easy...

Drop it already.

Just stop the
concerned father
role, all right?

It doesn't fit you well.

It makes me want to throw up
all over this place.

Just cut it loose,
will you?

I like being on my own.

(door opens and shuts)

Yeah.

Hey, Dad,
thanks for coming by, okay?

I love you, Dad.

Give me a kiss,Papi.

I miss you.

Hey, don't be a stranger, man.

I'll see you again.

What can I get you?

Some questions answered.

Like what?

Like this man says he's
your father. Is that true?

Well, he's the man
that fucked my mother

and created a child he named...

Forget it.

Yeah, if that's being a father,
I guess he's my father.

And it means nothing
to me at all.

We're here, so let's make
the best of it, okay?

Don't worry about it.

We'll find
a better place.

It's going to be fun,
I promise you.

(music playing in distance)

?Desde el cielo he recibido
la noticia?

?Que un angel se ha escapado
sin querer?

?Esta andando preferido
por la tierra?

?Lo que tiene
es que se viste de mujer?

?Yo sospecho una criatura
que yo he visto?

?Porque cada vez...?

What's happening, John?

What?

It's about your mother, man.

Your sister called.

I'm sorry, man.

(melancholy music playing)

MOTHER:
This poem was written

by a great Puerto Rican,
greatpoeta.


That's good, huh?

See? We don't have to be waiters
or doormen.

And Miguelito,
you are the oldest

and you should know that

just because we are here

doesn't mean we don't have to
forget what we left there.

PINERO:
I've never seen
a palm tree in my life!

I told you guys
we'd get back home one day.

?...es la tierra pura
y de gracia...?

Puerto Rico!

(all laughing)

?...y pueblos hechiceros?

? Puerto Rico. ?

And the island is left
unattended

because the middle-class
bureaucratic Cuban has arrived

spitting blue-eyed justice
at brown-skinned boy

in military khaki.

Compromise to survive.

His hairline-length,
mustached-trimmed face

looking grim
like a soldier on furlough

further cannot exhibit contempt
for what is not cacique-born.

Man, I've been waiting for
this day all my life!

(clapping rhythm)

This poem

will receive a burning,
stomach-turning scorn.

Nullified...

classified...

racist...

from this Pan Am Eastern

First National

Chase Manhattan Puerto Rico.

(sparse laughter and applause)

It's kind of quiet in here.

Reminds me of the time

I auditioned for
the parole board at Sing Sing.

(microphone feedback squeals)

Well, excuse me

but I'm not sure that
you know about

our internal problems here.

I mean, what is it that you feel
for Puerto Rico

besides an
obvious affection

and some kind of nostalgic
notion of what we really are

besides rum,
and music

and dominoes
on the sidewalk

and God knows
what else you need

to feed this anger.

You don't know?

Listen...

even if well-intentioned

it is still out of place
when it comes from a character

that corrupts
the language

when you are
calling yourselves

"Nuyoricans"

as if it was a race?

Check this out.

I was born here in the
town of Gurabo, in 1948.

Lived on this island
till the age of seven.

My family decided to move
to New York--

not a trip that I planned
nor wanted.

I am Puerto Rican.

Now, I subnamed myself with

a reality-given motherfucking
slang of a title--

in this case "Nuyorican"--

and wherever I go,
I am Puerto Rican

and Rican, and Nuyorican
24 hours a day.

Now, if you are embarrassed

or afraid of what you are,
don't blame me.

It's not my fault.

Blame that fucking Oxford shirt
you're wearing from

whatever prison you live in
that forces you to wear it

to fake something that
you are not

to be something that
you are not.

See, 'cause even if I am
half-and-half

any of those halves
is more whole than all of you.

I know what I am

and I know when it hurts
and I'm still the same man.

The same Puerto Rican,
24 hours a day.

But thank you.

Thank you for your comments.

Does anyone else have

any comments, questions,
literary criticism?

Don't be afraid. Speak up.

This is a free country,
I think.

(scattered applause)

Hey, man, you came here
looking for a piece of ass

and you find your own daughter
selling her pussy.

Maybe you should, you know,
keep it in the family.

An invited trick
and a ho staring
at each other

and they turn out
to be family.

Daddy's going to pay to fuck
his little girl.

Man!

I must have woke up

on the wrong side of the bed
this morning

'cause nothing's
gone right at all.

Everybody gone.

All the smokes smoked,
the liquor gone.

Nothing left but some warm beer.

That's what I got

to leave behind in my will.

My great estate.

Can you hear me?

You know what?

I guess today

just ain't my day.

Guess not.

Police! Freeze! Nobody move!

(loud, frantic Latin music
playing)

(all yelling)

Come on, let's go!

She doesn't have
to come with us.

Of course she does, man!

(frantic screaming)

WOMAN:
No, no, no!

No... no!

Tito, now what the
fuck are you doing?

Stay the fuck away!

Don't fuck with me, Miky!

Stay the fuck away!

(baby crying)

This is fucked.

This is fucked!

(woman sobbing)

So, thanks for
the ride, you know?

It's been fun.

Miky, I...

No, no.

Save it for your wedding.

Miky...


What you writing now?

The final chapter of my life.

It seems I'm writing it
myself alone.

"Even if nothing
was happening in my world

"life was there--

"perhaps poorly
represented

but it was there."

Do me one favor.

Don't take me
to the hospital, please.

No, brother man, no.

Doctor's in the house.

Stand up.

Let's get you
settled inside, okay?

There you go.

Go ahead and lie back.

Put your feet up.


Oh, yeah.

All right.

It's nice in here,
isn't it?

Yeah, it's pretty good.

Except for
the bunk beds
and the sink

it's kind of like
right back where
we started.

Yeah.



Doctor's orders: got
some medicine for you.


Ah...

That's good.


One more, just
to be safe, huh?


There you go.

In fact, you know what?

I'm going to take one
for myself, too.


Can't party alone.

MAN:
Next on line, please.

Yeah, what a night, huh?

Two for Miguel Pinero.

Who?

Miguel Pinero.
Two free.

Pinero?

Can I see some I.D., please?

Identification.

Uh, yeah, sure,
but you know what?

I think this counter's a little
too high for my dick to reach.

You might have to look down,
you fucking faggot.

Security.

Security, please.

Unruly.

What's happening, John?

Thank you very much.
Enjoy the show.

Fuck you very much.

Next, please.

I'm talking about
the deal of the century.

Deal of the century.

$100 for the pair.

Big, big opening night tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

Cuba and his Teddy Bear.

I swear, it's
Cuba and his Teddy Bear.

How about you, brother?

No, thanks.

You got your tickets?

All right, be cool, be cool.

Good evening.

My name is Joseph Papp.


Our playwright tonight
belongs to a tradition

a tradition of artists,
whose devious

and renegade lives

paradoxically result...

in the most painstaking

devotion to the truth
and to the rigor of their craft.

Cuba and his Teddy Bear?

This is getting better.

You never know, man.

One day you might be
as good as me.

That day is today, baby.

PAPP:
If the life of our author
seems elusive and troubling

one can only applaud

what is so candidly engaged here
by his art

where nothing is stolen
or borrowed...

and a great deal is revealed.

PINERO:
Hi.

I really want to thank you
for your welcome

and say thank you
to you, Joe.

How you doing this evening?

Look, it's like
everything he said is true

you know, and, uh...

In this sense, our playwright

is as blessed
and as straight a writer

as they come.

Please welcome...

Mr. Miguel Pinero.


PINERO:
Dig it...


It's a great opportunity.

Did you see it when
I did it with Marty?

Hey, where you been?

I've been taking in
the scenery, you know.

Look, look,
please, please,
don't make a scene.

This is his night.

Come on,
it's his night.


(camera shutters clicking)

(trumpet playing jazz)

MAN:
Mr. Povod?

Yeah, that's my name.

Ask me again
and I'll tell
you the same.

Here you go.

How you
doing, brother?

Good, good.
How are you?

All right,
all right,
all right.

Where to?

PINERO:
Baby, you remember
the first time we came here

I sang you a song?

Remember that?

I remember you
fell in the river.

Oh, that reminds me...

I wrote something
for you last night.

You did?

Yeah. First time
I write in months.

You want
to hear it?

Do I have a choice?

Of course not.

All right, check this out.

(clearing throat)


There are things
that never change

and we are not one of them,
I fear.

The trouble with
our love is here.

The trouble with our love
is around

when you cannot look me
in the eye

and lie.

When you run so far away

that you forget
where to go back to.

Now you are what

you never
wanted to be.

Go ahead, blame me.

There are things
that'll never change.

Now we're two strangers
with a past...

and a future
that ain't gonna last.

And that is the trouble
with our love.

Last night,
we saw things

like we never did.

We both went our way...
and hid.

You like it?

Are you finished?

Yeah. What do you think?

You want to know
what I think?

Do you want to know
what I really think?

I've been hanging
in there all this time

for this... a poem?

What do you see
when you look at me, hmm?

What do you see?

I'm a real person.

I'm a real person
that loves you.

You know, Miguel...

I really wish you would
have married me...

made me happy...

had a real life
instead of all this jive shit.

I could've had your baby.

Be just a little normal.

I ain't dead yet,
you know?

Where's-where's my van?

Where's my van?

What happened?

Where's my van?

They tow it away.

I'm sorry, Miky.

I saw it through
the window.

(car alarm wails in distance)

Let me explain it to you.

I don't have the papers
because it's not my car.

It's my friend's.

Does your friend
have the registration?

Wait, you see,
it's not that simple, sir.

OFFICER:
Jesus!

Did he OD
or something?

No, no, he was sick.

We got to get
the coroner.

Miky, come on.

PINERO:
The doctor
says my body

doesn't want
to cooperate,
you know?

Doctors are
always wrong.

I mean, who knows when
it's really your time to go?

Look at me
with this HIV shit.

Fuck 'em.

You go when you're ready.

So you better
sit your ass down

and eat somecochi frito,
'cause this shit is ready.


And if this doesn't kill you
tonight, nothing will.

Hey,Profe,you
got a clean shirt
I could borrow?

Course I do.

What?

What?

I love you,Profe.

You know, no matter
what, I love you.

We're the only
ones left, baby.

Miky, come on.

You're making me wet.

It smells good,
you know?

It smells good.

Reality wasn't giving me
no play at the time

when my ashtray became
the cemetery

of all my lost memories.

I wonder who wrote that tune

about being back on top
in June?

Nigger forgot about
September and December.

Now that is a month to remember.

Well, I'm going nowhere.

Got nowhere to go.

Going nowhere fast.

But Sunday morning
in New York City

for the junkie,
there ain't no pity.

When walking down the street
with loaded dice

you hear the people say

"Hey, there goes Miky...

"Mike Pinero...

the junkie Christ."

(no audio)

Buy me another drink, baby.

But Tito...

And they came from
out of nowhere, man.

Boom, boom, boom!

Blasting them .38s our way.

I was in the car outside the
cash-your-checks joint, right?

And he came out shooting...

He? Who's he?

Anyways, they ran, right?

They ran their motherfucking
asses off.

And those that didn't

just laid down and played dead.


He was badder
than all of them, man.

I mean, it, like...

it was, like... he was Satan
in Heaven, right?

Fighting God for a piece
of the action, man.

That was Tito Goya.

A long way from Ponce, man.

Fucking kid's in jail
somewhere in fucking Texas.

I thought you said

he was crushed by an icebox
or something.

(no audio)

I got to sit down.


Hey!

Julio, you call 911.

I'll take care of him.

He's okay.

?  ?

PINERO:
Well, I never wanted
to be anybody

but a guy once said to me,
"You can write

and writing will get you
out of jail."

And it did and it didn't,
'cause I had to keep doing bad

to keep the writing good,
'cause I sell trouble.

I'd go down, bring up a sponge

another fish,
another pearl, maybe

but after you make that dive
one too many times

your ears get shot,
your eyes go blurry

and one day you finally come
to the surface and you say

"You know what?
I like it better down there."

Relax, Miky.
I'm right here.

Okay.

You know what to do
if I should go.

You remember the poem?

Yeah, I remember.

Don't worry.

I want music and wine
and poets prepared to read

to testify, okay?

(vocally improvising)

Relax.

We got a lot of work to do.


(vocally improvising)

"Just once, before I die

"I want to climb up
on the tenement sky

"to dream my lungs out

"till I cry

then scatter my ashes
through the Lower East Side."

"So let me sing

"my song tonight.

Let me feel out of sight."

"And let all eyes be dry
when they scatter my ashes

through the Lower East Side"

"From Houston to 14th Street,
from Second Avenue

"to the mighty D,
here the hustlers

"and suckers meet
their faggots and freaks

"will all get high on the ashes
that have been scattered

through the Lower East Side."

(man singing)

"There's no other place
for me to be.

"There's no other place
that I can see.

"There's no other town
around that brings you up

"or keeps you down.

"A thief, a junkie I've been

"Committed every known sin

"Jews and Gentiles,
bums and men of style

"runaway child, police shooting
while mother's futile wails

"pushers making sales

"dope wheelers and cocaine
dealers smoking pot

streets are hot and feed off
those who bleed to death."


"All that's true.
All that's true

"All that is true,
but this ain't no lie

"when I ask that my ashes
be scattered through

the Lower East Side."

"So here I am.

Yeah, look at me."

"I stand proud, as you can see.

Pleased to be from
the Lower East Side."

"A street-fighting man,
a problem of this land."

"I am the Philosopher
of the Criminal Mind

"a dweller of prison time

"a cancer
of Rockefeller's ghettocide.

This concrete tomb is my home."

"To belong, to survive
you got to be strong."

"You can't be shy,
less without request

someone will scatter your ashes
through the Lower East Side."

PINERO:
I don't want to be buried
in Puerto Rico.

I don't want to rest
in some north island cemetery.

I want to be near

the stabbing, shooting,
gambling, fighting

unnatural dying
and new birth crying.

So, please, when I die,
don't take me far away

just keep me nearby.

Just take my ashes
and scatter them

throughout the Lower East Side.

Every player is a poet,
an actor, a statesmen, a priest

but most of all, he's a player.

You go out there on the street

and you meet the world
of suckers

the world of greed
and whatever other names

have been defined for those
that seek something outside

the acceptance of their society

and you stand with your balls
exposed in the jungle of fear

and you battle, and you fight
the hardest fight of your life

each day out there

in them streets that demand
blood to nourish

its own energies.

Today and all the todays
and tomorrows that are left

inside your soul, you know?

And when it's over

and the streets are soaking up
in the blood

you smile and you know

that you just won another day
with yourself, you know?
