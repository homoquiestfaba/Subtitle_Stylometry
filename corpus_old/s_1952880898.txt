FADING OF THE CRIES (2011)

<i>June 17.</i>

<i>spent several months since
the death of my wife and daughter.</i>

<i>wonder every day why God
have been taken from me with one blow.</i>

<i>I went back to smoking, an invitation
the death of his arms wide open.</i>

<i>I feel more alone in this world
I was like never before.</i>

<i>I moved closer
my sister for support.</i>

<i>My editor thought that buying this
house would be a distraction from my pain.</i>

<i>An obvious attempt to inspire me
end a long-delayed romance.</i>

<i>I'm still amazed at how
incredibly cheap this house.</i>

<i>Even for small-town values.</i>

<i>Still ...
I hope to be taking the right decision.</i>

<i>SILENCE the  CRY</i>

14 YEARS LATER

Where the hell are you?

Sarah?
What now?

Sarah!
You go, Maggie!

Where are you looking at?

Here you are.

I'm so attached to you.

My God.

As you climbed up

What are you doing?
Just look at some old stuff.

You know, do not cost anything to call me
mother once in a while. What are you looking?

You must always be
espiolhar to everything I do?

I'm only seeing the
old stuff from Uncle Michael.

What?

I miss him, yes?

This is a very valuable antique.

And I know that Uncle Michael would want

In case you forgetting,
he gave it to me.

I just think you should not use while
you're not a little more responsible.

What age do you think I am?
I'll be late ...

Where you going?

Sarah.

Where you going?
When are you coming?

I told you,
I will spend the night at Emily's house.

No. Do not tell me that.

I'm tired of you always have to try
have in my life. I'm out of here.

Sarah!

This conversation is not over yet!

Now you can stop listening.

Where you going?
Anywhere but here.

I thought we were going out together ...
Jill, we may go another day, okay?

Stop arming you into silly.
I have to go.

Damn!
You gave me a cagaça!

Sorry, where were you? It was supposed
end we found an hour ago.

Yes, I know. Maggie was

Goat.

So, you brought it?

Yes ..

Beautiful.

Creed, this place still
I fear hell of a mess.

What?
Put yourself.

I am sure that
was better when your uncle lived here.

Yes, I know, not applicable.

Okay, let's go.

Come on!
Come on, Sarah.

Where'd you get the necklace?

It was my uncle.

It seems an age or so.

Yes

Maggie was
tease me for having it taken away.

What is her problem?

Same as always.

Attempts to control my life because
basically has no control over his own.

The same crap as always.
You know what? Do not worry.

Because I'm here.

That's what I'm here.

I'm here to
remember that we still live ...

a city of shit
where there is nothing to do.

Nothing to do ...

Thank you.

I think.

What abnormal.

Let's get outta here.

Give me your hand.

Can you run?

Thankfully,
because we have a lot to run.

What do they want?
To you.

Stay close to me.
What do we do?

We must get away from the streets.
How?

We have to go through them.
Are you ready?

Are you ready?
Yes.

Now!

Jill, I'll leave.
Mom, this television does not work.

The cable must be
probably off, dear.

Are you sure you'll be okay?

Leave off,
I'm almost 15 years.

Okay, I'll have my phone with me.
If you need me, call me, okay?

Jill?

Okay! Goodbye.

Come on ...

Unbelievable.

Shit!

Come back soon.

Jill, make sure that all
doors and windows are locked.

Why? What's up?

Did something happen?
Do it! Now!

Shit ...

Jill will check
the back door.

Damn! You gave me a cagaça.
Attention to language, girl.

Come on.

My god! Lower yourself.

Get down and stays that way.

Right ...

We must find
a safer place.

Mom, why do not you tell me
what happens?

Because I do not know what is happening.

Come on.

And the car?

Does not work. Go up the stairs.

<i> June 21. </ i></i>

<i> passed only a few days
since I moved here </ i></i>

<i> and my mind
already is tricking me. </ i></i>

<i>I see no shadows 
one that causes. </ i></i>

<i> hear sounds coming from above
my room at night. </ i></i>

<i> Maybe you're crazy. </ i></i>

<i> This does not seem to escape the images
devastating for my wife and daughter </ i></i>

<i> in its final moments. </ i></i>

<i> seems unreal the power
re-embrace again. </ i></i>

He says: "Hello, Uncle Michael."

Hello

Sarah, how are you?

Can you say it?

Hello

It was not easy when the father of Sarah
left us last year.

I thought my world would end.

I think what
I'm trying to say is that ...

... know how it feels to be alone.

Thanks.

Mom.

What are you doing?

Mommy will catch you!

Mommy will catch you.
He picked up his girl!

My beautiful girl.

In the old church!
There should be safe!

It's too far!
We're almost there!

They can not enter here.

This place is too
strong for them.

What is your name?

Sarah.

I still think that
this is just a bad dream.

It's more than you can imagine.

Who are you?

Where are you from?

I'm Jacob.

I need you to trust me.

My best friend
just died!

You appear out of nowhere ...
and those things ...

Sorry about your friend.

My God, what's that?

Security has been broken!

We must leave here.

<i> June 25. </ i></i>

<i>They spent a few days since 
I read the diary. </ i></i>

<i> I can only assume that belonged
the previous owner of the house. </ i></i>

<i> I think its fascinating reading
the hours seem to fly. </ i></i>

<i> This is so ...</ i></i>

<i> me that I have difficulty
concentrate on writing my novel. </ i></i>

<i>'s always so cold in this house. </ i></i>

<i>Last night I woke 
hear a faint sound of crying </ i></i>

<i> coming from above
the ceiling of my room. </ i></i>

<i> I found nothing. </ i></i>

<i>However  ...</ i></i>

<i> ... felt some
thing was watching me. </ i></i>

<i>I'm always a 
feeling uncomfortable in this house. </ i></i>

<i> As if I belonged. </ i></i>

<i> constantly ...</ i></i>

<i> ... I want to remember it. </ i></i>

Get down!

Down! Go!

Listen.

With attention, child.

Who are you?

I'm Mathias,
the necromancer of darkness.

But your concern
should be with what you have.

Do not know what you're talking about.

The rune placed Sayorlean
inside of your silver necklace.

Returns it.

I do not understand.

It is precisely for
That must be returned.

You do not understand its power.

Not with your partner
Abes of the sword.

Stay away.

Calm down, child.
Will you give me the rune.

What makes you think that I ...

Ma can not take, do you?

Now only you have the
power to end this chaos.

Return the paste to the mansion Ekling

and all this madness will end.

The necklace belongs to me.

It belonged to my uncle.

Stolen from me by it
and so their blood line

is cursed forever.

Give me the necklace

and I will spare your
family curse it carries.

And if it fails?

Then I'll send the very essence
with the nightmares that are created

until they tear
your decaying flesh.

Sarah.

I am.

We must continue,
there is an exit on the other side.

Where are we?

Beneath the city. An old camera
rest for church members.

I lived in this city ever since ...
Ali ahead!

What? What is that?

We gotta get outta here!
Why? What is it?

Do not look back!

Where are we?
For output.

We have to climb!
Jacob!

Do not look down!

Ali

Did you hear that?
Yes, it's someone at the door.

I see.
There may be another thing like that.

It could be your sister.
Mom, do not go.

Jill, I have to see if it is Sarah.

Stay here.

Sarah?

My God ...

Stay away.

Come on,
here we are not safe.

What are you ...

Go, go.

Are you sure we
be safe up here?

Because if not, we're stuck.

Of course we'll be safe.

I do not see
these things around.

Never trust in your eyes.

All those cries echoing.

Lower yourself.

They're everywhere!

They are hunting us.

They see us?
Head toward the woods.

Stopped.

Can not cross.

Look at them.
Whence come all?

We need to continue.

You must be kidding.

We have to go through.

Already crossed half.

They're here.

There, there, did not you?

Run to the other side
and not look back.

Jacob ...
Now.

Continues!

Gone are all.

I know.

Can we rest now?
We went to run all night.

There under.

A night with a sky so beautiful.
It makes no sense what is happening.

Get it fast!

What?
Now!

Why?

It's impenetrable,
even for a sword.

Body contact, was well
they knew where we were.

I have this forever and now you're
say who persecute us because of it?

When was the first time that you used?
Just tonight, but I ...

It's me missing something?

And who the hell are you? And how did you know the
passage beneath the church?

And how you were there in
just when I was attacked?

Not everything is as it seems.

Then answer it.

Are you following me?

Are you hiding something from me.

And to tell the truth ...

... scare me.

Got something to see
with all this?

Yes

In what?

My family was
murdered in this city.

<i> I felt there was
something wrong with the house </ i></i>

<i> in the day that I and the
My family went to live there. </ i></i>

<i> found an old diary that contained
symbols etched into the pages. </ i></i>

<i>It was hidden under 
the loft floor. </ i></i>

<i>There  spells, each with the objective
to induce or protect from evil. </ i></i>

<i>This is the source 
the power of the necromancer. </ i></i>

Necromancer?

A magician who can awaken and communicate
with the dead through symbols.

Then this ...

... necromancer is responsible
for all this?

He is able to
create a real nightmare.

You saw it. When?

Beneath the church.

He said his name is Mathias.

I did not know what to believe, not
know why you were protecting me ...

What did he say?

What ...

... the necklace is yours to him.

The diary was
designs that stone e. ..

... a name for herself,
Sayorlean the rune.

Gave the necromancer power
to control the day and night.

Each night he stays
stronger with his control.

If he makes the day into night,
this town will not survive.

My Uncle Michael
let me die before.

How did you get that necklace?

I do not know.

I was very small.

Where were you living?

At the mansion Ekling
where you found me.

My parents were murdered
shortly after I discovered the diary.

When?

It seems like yesterday.

Did not know
the house had been sold ...

That was quick.

Maggie should already be
going on because of me.

Maggie?
My mother, I ...

... I refuse to call it that.

And Jill, my sister.
Is with her.

At least now
I do not have to deal with them.

I envy you for credentials.

What happened?

Left ...

You think this will end?

Everything has to end, Sarah.

You better get some rest.

Let's wait until the morning.

Mother? Father?

Anna!

What now?

What the hell she wants now?

Hello
Hello, Maggie.

We brought you some cookies.

Thanks.

They ...

... seem to be very good.

Can we come?

Sure they can.

So ...

... what brings you here?
I thought you wanted to get away

and go do something.

I have not felt comfortable
get out and do great things ...

... lately.

Your editor did you get
closed here?

No, I have been to ignore it ...

Do not touch that!

No matter.

Sorry. I do not know what ...

... is happening to me lately.

Michael, are you okay?

Yes, I'm just ...

... a little cranky lately.
That's it.

I understand.

So ...

... what you been up to?
I. ..

Can I show you.

Okay.

Look at this.

Saw it?

How did you?

You see this? I found it ...

... in the attic ...

... beneath the floorboards
and has all these ...

... explanations of how to do
a date different spells e. ..

Michael ...

... this is not good.

What do you mean?

What do you think I'm doing?
This is not correct.

Maggie, this is my opportunity
to do something extraordinary.

You know, it's a shame that your
limited mind can not see it.

I think we'd better go.

I agree.

You know what, Maggie?

Not even
I invited you to come here.

Sarah.

Yes?

Gotta go.

All disappeared.

The necromancer does not
has control during the day.

Last night in Ekling ...

... why were there?

To stem the evil.

But what makes
this house so dangerous?

It is where the
Mathias lived there years ago.

Nobody there is welcome
provided that the condition complained.

It's funny.

When I was little, they told me
Always stay away from that place.

I always thought
nothing more than an urban myth.

Look.

It's almost as if she
was still in pain.

We must continue.

I do not want this to happen.

Promise me
if this happens, shoot me.

I'll take you home safely.

Do not believe I'm saying, but
I really miss Maggie and Jill.

What happens if they
become one of those things?

I kill them.

Jill, dear.
My God ...

It's okay.
Just me.

What a fucking nightmare!

Is it safe?

Yes

Down, but see where you put your feet.

Be careful.

This is so disgusting.

<i> July 2. </ i></i>

<i> passed a few days since
I started practicing the spells of the diary. </ i></i>

<i> I was so fascinated by these texts </ i></i>

<i> no longer have time to
my own novel surface. </ i></i>

<i>This morning I learned something 
about the past of the necromancer. </ i></i>

<i> seems he was studying spells </ i></i>

<i> hoping to bring
his wife back. </ i></i>

<i> Apparently she was murdered. </ i></i>

<i> had actually achieved when
rumors spread of her witchcraft. </ i></i>

<i>The elders of the church 
Mathias came and forced </ i></i>

<i> to see his wife die ...
the second time. </ i></i>

<i> Their texts began to
become more bizarre and twisted </ i></i>

<i> to the extent that he
seemed to be consumed by anger. </ i></i>

<i> Cursing the city elders.
Threatening to wake the dead. </ I></i>

<i>The following spell  required much more
than what he had done before. </ i></i>

<i> Finish with someone's life. </ i></i>

<i> I do not know if I'll do fine. </ i></i>

<i> texts speak in this journal
of demonology. </ i></i>

<i>Waking the dead and 
contain the evil within symbols. </ i></i>

<i>Although no

<i>Three keepers were invoked 
Mathias to protect the necromancer. </ i></i>

<i> execute their revenge
with the elders of the city. </ i></i>

<i> Malyhne, his messenger. </ i></i>

<i> Terhael, his eyes during the day. </ i></i>

<i> Sylathus ...
his revenge. </ i></i>

Terhael ... appears.

Have got to be
My eyes and ears

and it rewards me with something.

I have no powers
until they recover the rune.

I was robbed by a girl.

She travels with a companion.

Kill them.

And retrieve the rune.

If we are around, we lose the light.

What?

Run!

What the hell is that?

Shit.

We must come to that barn!

How do we go from here?

No. .. I can not stand ...

Already can not stand the noise.

We'll succeed
I swear I will.

<i> July 5. </ i></i>

<i> This is my first attempt
to awaken the demon Sylathus. </ i></i>

<i> I no longer care more
consequences. </ i></i>

<i>I no longer think 
more in eating or sleeping. </ i></i>

<i> My editor finally gave up
to try to contact me. </ i></i>

<i> immediately recognized him at the bar. </ i></i>

<i>The driver responsible 
the death of my family. </ i></i>

<i> I took it to my house
under false pretenses. </ i></i>

<i>He was too drunk 
to recognize me. </ i></i>

When did the girl appears
for a business?

<i> I had the clear impression that
he had a twinge of remorse </ i></i>

<i> for killing my family. </ i></i>

<i> So
I offered him another drink. </ i></i>

She descends.

How about another drink
while you wait?

Thanks.

You do not drink anything?

No, I do not drink.

I quit drinking ...

It's the only thing for which I live.

After a drunk ...

... have killed my family ...

It changed my
perspective on things.

The worst part is that ...

... he got away
because of one detail.

And walked free.

What the hell is this?

Do not say anything?
Only by chance?

How did it feel ...

... to kill my family ...

... and destroy my life?

Listen ...

What the hell is going on here?

It was an accident.

I'm not here ...

... to apologize
for your family.

I'm out of here.

Not with life.

What?

You'll stab me?

I already did.

What the hell?

This is it.

Sarah.

We must leave here.

And if that thing is still there?

We can not wait for the night.

I am disappointed, my servant.

Whither fled?

Come.

The Malyhne awaits us.

Okay, this is the last.

Give me a hand?

Jill?

Jill?

Jill?

Jill?

And some of the blood line of Michael.

Mother!

<i> July 9. </ i></i>

<i>They spent three days since 
invoking Sylathus. </ i></i>

<i>I fear for my safety 
because both the demons </ i></i>

<i> disappeared in
dark confines of the house. </ i></i>

<i> I wonder why
reason has not killed me. </ i></i>

<i> What are you waiting for? </ i></i>

Michael?

Hello, enters.

Want a glass of water?

Water ...
Yes, water is fine.

Okay, I will get.
Thanks.

Not expecting to see you,
but I'm glad you left home.

Hello

Sorry ...
you can not come to know.

I will miss you.

Will always be safe.

Shit.

Here you go.

Are you okay?

I'm fine.

Toma.

Michael?

It's a gift for Sarah.
Give him ...

Gives you only when you
old enough.

Okay ...

Just want to say ...

... I regret that.

Michael, it's okay.
I'm just worried about you.

Gotta go.

No, wait.

Maggie?

The whole family together again.

Damn you!

You chose your own destiny.

I advise you ...

... for the safety of
your family ...

... return it to the rune Sayorlean.

I lost it!
Very foolish decision.

It was her only hope.

Remove her legs.

So ...

... the child returns.

The sword of Abes.
Strip it to him.

Leave her alone!
Come on.

Come on.

What ...

... is more valuable to you?

The rune ...

... or the life of your sister?

Sarah, do not do.

You promise that the loose?

I give you my word.

Please!

Let her go!

Do you know where to find us.

So long.

Jill!

Sarah ...

... what have you done?

She is my sister.

She will be fine.
Where to take?

Back to the mansion Ekling.

Do not say anything, I have
for taking that horrible place.

You can not.
She is my sister.

You have no chance to get back there.

She's all alone
without anyone to help.

Will you get it?

Do not leave me much choice.

Sorry no
have trusted you before.

Will I ever see you?

Remember.

How could I forget?

Go inside.

For luck.

Farewell ...

I have to finish with
what started it.

Mathias ...

I suppose not
necessary introductions.

Leave behind the texts blacks knowing
that would guarantee my resurrection.

My predestined
tormentor and savior ...

Give me the rune.

And I convey unto thee his
real power

that never was
described in my writing.

Do not can have.
I can be quite ...

... convincing.

I'm not afraid of you.

I learned how to destroy it,
you idiot!

Selaste your own destiny.
I saved my soul ...

... and destroy her with this spell.

Are you sure?

Before you give your last breath ...

... curse your whole family!

Not with this,
sealed his own fate.

Kill him.
The prophecy was not fulfilled.

It's the end of the line.

Be careful, Sylathus.

The Terhael will need it,
of what remains of it.

Where's Jill?

I am also happy to see you, Maggie.
Sarah ...

... where is she?

Hear me, Jacob is the
only one who can bring back.

He saved my life last night.

I'm not going to sit here waiting
someone who does not even know who he is.

You really have to stay sober.
And you have to take you away right now!

Damn it if
I sit here waiting.

Come on out and we find it.
Oh yeah?

You're going out there and you're dead!

Where am I?

Come here, child.

Look forward to you.

Tell me what your eyes see.

It's just the city ...
No.

This is not an ordinary city, child.

You are cursed for
forever for their sins.

Sins?

Against me
against my wife.

And against my unborn son.

And with such a vengeance I replied.

You know what this is?

It belonged to my uncle Michael.

Stolen from me by him.

And so I cursed his
bloodline.

Your blood line.

Notes.

While I darken
again these empty skies.

Maggie, a body is still here.

Open the door, I can handle this.

It's already getting dark.

Hurry up!

No!

The night ... returned.

It's time to reawaken the beast.

Sylathus.

Kills the intruder.

I returned home.

Nothing ...

What was it?

Maggie ... Maggie, no!

Emily ...

Emily, no!

Close it! Take this!

Michael ...

Spell Protection.

Get down!

They are there.

So how did deceived
death so easily?

Are you dead?

Anna!

The last I remember,
a trembling soul eras

that forced his last breath.

Vieste as consideration
by a family murdered

whose cries were silenced at night?

Vieste enjoy it.

Preparations were made especially
for you, Spell Protection.

How's your leg?

I'm so cold.

I thought I had not
lost so much blood.

Toma.

Ready.

Thank you.

Do not hear anyone scream.

They got everybody.

I was so afraid that
something you had happened.

I never thought to worry about.

You and Jill were all he had
after your father is gone.

I regret that
you will have felt this way.

You'll always be my girl.

Thank you for saving me.

I love you.

I love you too, Mom.

Find peace.

Mother, I think we'll be fine.

Since we remain silent,
I think not ...

Mother?

Mother, do not. Please, God,
do not let that happen.

No!

Please mother, do not get up!

Mother!

No, no ... No!

The sword does not contain Abes
more power in the circle

than any other weapon vulgar.

I will end your existence!

You can not hide from me!

Get out of the shadows.

And witness the death of this child.

Give your last breath.

Remember, Return Protection,
have no effect on this ...

... circle!

No!

No!

Now die!

Jill?

Are you okay?

Anda.

We'll take you home.

It worked.

The rune has been broken.
I fell right on top of you.

Nobody would have survived
a fall like that.

Why is he calling you to
"Spell of Protection"?

That's what I am.

Mother?

Mother?

Mother?

Mother!

No. ..

Sarah?

I am very sorry ...

It was supposed
Protection Spell beings.

I know.

Was it for her.

I'm it.

As long as you have,
can bring them back.

Can I bring them back.

Bring them back ...

I told you!

You can not kill what is already dead.

The torture you for eternity.

Then your heart
is mourning the loss of another

and finally you found
your purpose?

Yes ..

The silence of thy cry!
