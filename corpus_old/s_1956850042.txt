Then I showed them how she can open, and inside thereâ€™s another, and another, and another and another.

So, did everyone at school like Sofia?

Whatâ€™s not to like?

Well, Of course.

Hey, You pick this time.

Huh.

Are you sure?

Daffodils are my favorites, too.

Okay.

I changed my mind.

We donâ€™t need flowers.

Well, I was thinking weâ€™d have ravioli tonight.

I want sushi.

Well, Tough luck, I want pasta.

But you can pick the dessert.

Câ€™mon!

I would like a nice wedge of Asagio and two boxes of spinach ravioli.

Sure!

My pleasure.

Now, why donâ€™t you go find us some chocolate.

C'mon!

What are you lookinâ€™ at?

What are you looking at?

What are you looking at!?

Itâ€™s okay.

Itâ€™s just an accident.

Paul, They need you in the back.

Now!

Iâ€™m so sorry, Mrs. Weiss.

Itâ€™s okay.

Anyone can have an off day.

Uh, Everyday is an off day for Paul.

Oh, Donâ€™t say that.

Heâ€™s a good man.

Thank you so much.

Weâ€™ll see you next week.

Okay.

What the hell is wrong with you?

C'mon

Câ€™mon sweetie. Donâ€™t stare.

Let them have their own private business.

I didnâ€™t get the chocolate.

Thatâ€™s okay.

Iâ€™ve got a secret stash of brownies in the freezer.

But you canâ€™t tell daddy.

Why do you think heâ€™s good?

Daddy?

No, the Deli man.

Because I think all people are good.

Câ€™mon!

In you go, butterfly!

Okay!

Now what every lady needs is her lipstick.

Oh!

Very pretty!

Ready for take off?

Butterfingers.

Shoot!

Yahâ€¦

What are you looking at?

Momâ€¦(Echoes)

Rachel

Paul!

What are you looking at!?

Morning bug,

guess how many miles.

A hundred.

Very close.

Six.

What did you get?

Nothing good.

Thereâ€™s no milk.

There will be milk tomorrow.

I Promise.

How â€˜bout some coffee?

What do you think, you ready for your big first day?

Are you?

You look pretty.

Okay, now.

I can drop you off, but I canâ€™t pick you up.

So, you get to take the bus home everyday.

Yhey!

I just bet, that you are going to really like it here Rach.

Thereâ€™s a lot of fresh air.

Nice people.

Good people.

Things will be better here.

Donâ€™t forget the milk.

See you later alligator.

Mrs. Stanton will be there when you get home.

Bye babe.

[Bell rings]

Michelle, look!

New girl.

Hi, Iâ€™m Hazel Marie.

Iâ€™m Rachel.

Hi, Iâ€™m Ms. Miller

and uhmm... Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m late.

Okay, whoâ€™s excited to start fourth grade?

Me!

Me!

Thatâ€™s what I want to hear.

Come in!

She has an ugly birthmark girl.

Ugly birthmark girl.

Ugly birthmark girl.

Awwâ€¦

Câ€™mon. Letâ€™s go!

Youâ€™re so funny Michelle.

No one wears clothes like that.

And her shoes suck.

Itâ€™s been weird.

You know, being back in her house andâ€¦

Iâ€™m so sorry to hear about your grandmother, dear.

Oh, thank you.

Weâ€™re you in my third grade?

I canâ€™t remember.

No.

You have the Lowe girl this year?

Michelle. Yah.

Well.

Good luck with that.

Mr. Weiss said no television.

Sofia!

Why donâ€™t you go outside and get some fresh air?

[Phone rings]

What do you want, Scott?

Youâ€™re the one that ruined our creâ€¦youâ€™re the one that ruined that credit, werenâ€™t you?

Okay, You know what, you should have thought of that before you screwed your research assistant!

Yes, Same time!

Thanks Mrs. Stanton.

Got the milk.

Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m late.

Are you going to work all the time now?

No. Not all the time.

Iâ€™m helping people though. Donâ€™t you think thatâ€™s important?

No one likes lawyers.

How was school?

I miss Los Angeles.

I miss the palm trees.

I miss the sounds.

You miss the helicopters and the sirens and the dirty air.

I miss my friends.

You make new friends.

How about your teacher?

What is she like?

Ms. Miller?

Sheâ€™s nice.

Oh, See!

Sheâ€™s sad.

Like me.

Hi guys!

Hmpf!

Who would hang out with her?
I know! What a weirdo.

I like your shoes.

You said they were ugly.

I changed my mind.

Whatâ€™s your name again?

Rachel.

Iâ€™m Michelle.

Wanna come to my house and play after school?

We have candy bars and a play station.

Please say yes.

Hey Mom, this is my new best friend, Rachel.

Hi Rachel. Itâ€™s nice to meet you.

Howâ€™s my sweet angel?

Mom, Youâ€™re all dirty.

What are those?

Youâ€™ve never seen a bulb before?

On the outside, theyâ€™re pretty ugly.

But on the inside, thereâ€™s a flower just waiting to come out.

A Daffodil.

Or maybe there are spiders inside just waiting out to crawl in your hands and bite it.

Mom, we want candy bars.

In the silverware drawer.

Just one though.

Everything is so pretty.

Want to hear me play the piano?

Youâ€™re good!

I know. I donâ€™t even need lessons.

Deborah canâ€™t have snacks because sheâ€™s punished.

Youâ€™re punished!

See what she did to me?

Boo!!

You wanna see my room?

Thatâ€™s my sister Miranda.

Sheâ€™s dead.

Oh, Sorry.

Why?

I donâ€™t know.

Thatâ€™s just what youâ€™re supposed to say.

This is my room.

This is my sheep.

Isnâ€™t she cute? I got her when I was four.

Your room is pretty.

I bet youâ€™re jealous.

You want to see something cool?

Here!

What is DC mean?


Here you try.

You want to see Mirandaâ€™s room?

Shhh! Donâ€™t tell.

Hi Daddy.

Hi.
Dad, you smell like sweat.

Sweat is what makes football great.
Hi!

This is Rachel. Sheâ€™s my new best friend.

Nice to meet you, Rachel.

Will you be staying for dinner?

I have to go home.

Donâ€™t forget to say my name in your prayers tonight.

Okay.

Bye.

So, how did you and Rachâ€¦?

Rachel!

What happened?

Are you hurt?

Where have you been?

I justâ€¦ I went home with a friend.

Donâ€™t you ever do that again!

Do you hear me?

What if something happens to you bug?

You know better than that.

Iâ€™m sorry.

Youâ€™re sorry?

Youâ€™re sorry.

Iâ€™m sorry too baby.

Iâ€™m just so worried.

So ahhâ€¦

you made a friend now?

I knew you would.

[Bell rings]

Go ahead. Heâ€™s dead.

He canâ€™t see you.

Câ€™mon, weâ€™ll miss the bus.

This used to be a real garden.

A thousand vegetables.

Now, itâ€™s all dead.

Thereâ€™s a body buried here. Do you believe me?
No.

What happened to your mom?

She died.

I guess she didnâ€™t love you enough then.

Yes, She did!

What about your dad?

What about?

Is he nice?

Yeah.

As nice as mine?

I donâ€™t know.

Everyone loves my dad.

He gets to be in the parade and everything.

And his students bring us cookies and stuff.

And he gets his picture in the paper all the time.

Oh.

He doesnâ€™t love me, though.

He wishes I was dead.

Like Miranda.

Worms are so cool.

If you cut a worm in half, it can still live.

Worms are good to fish with.

Sometimes, worms get dried up on the sidewalks and die.

The end.

[Class Clapping]

Thank you, Thomas.

Next time, maybe you can, uhâ€¦ throw a little more science in your science report.

Okay, Whoâ€™s next?

Rachel.

Good luck, Rachel.

Butterflies begin their lives as caterpillars.

A butterfly lays her eggs on a tree leaf.

When the egg hatches, a larva emerges.

This larva turns into a caterpillar.

The caterpillar will spin a cocoon of silk.

Inside the cocoon, the caterpillar turns into a pupa, waiting to be reborn as something new.

After a few weeks, the pupa emerges from the cocoon as a butterfly.

This is called metamorphosis.

[Class claps]

Thank you, Rachel. That was very, very nice.

Who wants to go next?

Michelle.

My sister, Miranda, died before I was born.

She had a disease called leukemia.

Leukemia is cancer in your blood.

It makes your cells go crazy and you have to have chemotherapy.

It hurts.

It makes your insides boil.

Iâ€™m sorry about your sister, Michelle, but...

weâ€™re studying insects.

Did you prepare a report on insect?

You can do your report tomorrow.

I can help you with your report.

Do you like beetles?

Oh!

Why did you do that?

It was an accident.

Sorry.

Here

Itâ€™s not that bad.

See?

There.

I know how to make you feel better.

Lie on the bed. Itâ€™s very soft.

Theyâ€™re pretty right?

Sometimes I pretend Iâ€™m inside them.

Like time is frozen and I cant move.

Michelle!!

How many times have I told you to stay out of Mirandaâ€™s room??

Has the devil gotten into you? What is wrong with you?

Stevenâ€¦ Steven... stop it!

I thought you liked pepperoni.

I do.

Tell me.

Whatâ€™s wrong?

Something happened in school?

Then what?

I thought I saw something.

Saw what?

Something that wasnâ€™t there.

Is this one of your word puzzles? Coz,

I got to be honest bug, Iâ€™m not too sharp tonight.

[Doorbell rings]

Are you expecting someone?

Hi, Iâ€™m Bernice Lowe. Michelleâ€™s mother.

Rachel forgot her book bag today.

Oh, Yeah!

Nathan Weiss. Itâ€™s a pleasure to finally meet you.

Can I offer you ladies something to drink?

Weâ€™re just finishing up dinner.

No, Thank you.

We just dropped by to apologize to Rachel.

My husband lost his temper with Michelle this afternoon and I think it frightened her.

Heâ€™s got a big game coming up and heâ€™s under a lot of pressure.

Weâ€™re very sorry Rachel.

What do you say, bug?

Itâ€™s Okay.

Here, Daddy fixed it.

Weâ€™d like you to come and spend the night Friday.

A little camp-out in the backyard.

Should we save you some marshmallows?

Iâ€™ve never been camping.

You can borrow my pink sleeping bag.

Please say yes.

[Michelle and Rachel giggling]

Donâ€™t zip the flap.

Letâ€™s watch the stars.

When you look at the stars, youâ€™re looking into the past.

Did you know that?

Everything youâ€™ve ever known is in there up in the stars.

Everything youâ€™ve ever seen.

Mom.

I guess.

[Michelle murmuring in her sleep]

Michelleâ€¦

Michelle...

Michelle!!

Michelle!!

[Rachel screaming]

You ready to tell me what happened?

You scared the Loweâ€™s. You scared me.

I need you to tell me.

I saw something.

I saw her sister.

Her sister who died.

Miranda. And she had blood on her.

No. You had a bad dream.

It was real. Just like the man in the Deli.

No. Rachel.

It was your imagination.

And sometimes people see things that arenâ€™t really there.

It seems real, but itâ€™s not.

Sometimes your motherâ€¦

You went through a lot, bug.

No one blames you for having trouble adjusting.

You donâ€™t believe me.

Come here!

Come here.

Hey,

I promise to keep you safe.

Okay?

I donâ€™t want to go there again... ever.

You donâ€™t have to do anything you donâ€™t want to do.

Rachel, Welcome back.

Come see the eggs.

How will they come out?

Well... All they need is a little bit of heat, and a little bit of love and before you know it, theyâ€™re gonna hatch.

So, what I want all of you to do is to think really warm thoughts.

[Kids giggling]

Okay, Back to your desks.

Kacy, would you please pass out a piece of paper to everyone?

I saved your homework. The Math was really hard. Itâ€™sâ€¦

Hey! Uhmâ€¦Come over at my house after school.

I canâ€™t.

Why not?

I just canâ€™t.

Hope youâ€™re feeling better.

You know if thereâ€™s ever anything you need to talk about.

All you have to do is ask.

All right?

All right.

Good!

Hi.

You said I could come talk to you.

Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Câ€™mon in.

Why do you have this picture?

Heâ€™s my brother.

What happened to him?

He disappeared. When I was a teenager.

Did he die?

I donâ€™t know.

We never found anything.

Sorry.

Are you sure you like tea?

Iâ€™m sure.

Are you going to unpack your boxes?

I donâ€™t know, maybe.

Can I look inside?

Oh okay.

Pretty.

Psychology,

I know what that is.

You do.

I saw a psychologist at my old school.

He talked a lot.

He smelled like milk.

What exactly does milk smell like?

I donâ€™t know. Milk.

Are you a psychologist?

No,

well, I studied in college but Iâ€™m a teacher now.

Is this really your house?

It was my grandmotherâ€™s.

But she left it to me when she died.

What do you think happens to people when they die?

I donâ€™t know.

Do you think thereâ€™s a difference between good people and bad people?

When they die, I mean?

Iâ€™m not sure if I can answer that.

Oh.

Have you ever asked your father these questions?

He doesnâ€™t really listen.

Heâ€™s a lawyer.

I should get home.

My babysitter will worry if she finishes her sleep before I get back.

Thanks for the tea.

Oh, youâ€™re welcome.

Maybe you could come to our house for dinner one night.

I would like that.

Uhmmmâ€¦
A little more, a little more.


Very funny.

You know. This is bad luck.

Here we gotta throw.

[Doorbell Rings]


Pick that up.
Oh.

Ms. Miller?

Please. Just call me Abby.

Yes, Abby. Of course.

Iâ€™m Nathanâ€¦Iâ€™m Nathan.

Thanks. Oh. I brought wine.

Great!

I totally forgot about wine. Good.

Now we donâ€™t have to drink chocolate milk.

Iâ€™ve been meaning to come in and meet with you, but Iâ€™ve just been so busy with work lately.

Youâ€™re a lawyer, right?
yeah.

Donâ€™t hold that against me please.

I work for the County Legal Defense Fund.
â€“ Thanks babe.

Wow!

Sounds glamorous.

Thank you.

So Rachel tells me youâ€™re from Los Angeles.

Born and raised.

Yeah, We thought it was time for a change though; get out of the city for a while.

And how are you liking it so far?

Oh! Itâ€™s a beautiful town,

Itâ€™s quiet, itâ€™s peaceful.

We love it here. Right, bug?

Oh! I miss the city.

[Children giggling and playing]

Come to my birthday party.

Sorry we donâ€™t have room for everyone.

I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t want to go anyway.

Now give me my ball back.

See you there, Rachel.

[Country music playing]

Câ€™mon bug, Abby is waiting.

No two seeds are alike.

Each one makes a different tree.

Pretty.

Oh!

Thanks. It was uhm! Itâ€™s my Granâ€™s.

Burnt rose.

Yeah,

How did you know?

Do you like her?

Abby?

Yeah.

Sheâ€™s very nice.

As nice as mom?

Yikes.

What happened here?

No, Donâ€™t touch it, bug. Câ€™mon,

Iâ€™ll clean it up.

Youâ€™re ready for lights out?

Are you okay?

Itâ€™s just someone playing a joke, bug.

I donâ€™t think it was a joke,

What do you mean?

Nothing.

Sleep tight okay.

Love you.

Love you too.

Guess what I did this weekend?

My grandmother, me and my brother to pick out Halloween costumes.

Iâ€™m going to be a witch.

What about you?

I donâ€™t know,

Did you hear about the eggs?

Someone stole them from our classroom.

Iâ€™ll get it.

Okay.

Rachelâ€¦

Rachelâ€¦

Rachel, What happened?

Whatâ€™s wrong?

Nothing.

Come on.

Hiding from me?

No.

You didnâ€™t come to my party.

I had to go somewhere.

You want to play hopscotch?

I have to get home.

I saw what you did.

I saw you steal the lipstick.

No, I didnâ€™t!

Iâ€™m going to tell Mrs. Miller.

Sheâ€™s going to call the police.

Sheâ€™s going to have you arrested.

Sheâ€™s going to hate you.

Donâ€™t tell her. Please.

Well, I canâ€™t lie if youâ€™re not my friend anymore.

Thatâ€™s just not the way things work.

Iâ€™ll do whatever you want.

I want you to be my best friend again.

Or youâ€™ll go to jail

and your dad will be all alone.

Okay.

We can go to the Halloween carnival together.

[Halloween music playing]

Hey! Look how much candy I got.

My mom took me trick-or-treating at the mall,

Like we care! Câ€™mon.

Eww!...

I got peanut butter chilliâ€™s.

Trade me.

Watch out for razor blades.

Some kids get their tongues cut in half from razor blades in their Halloween candy.

No, they donâ€™t.

Yes, they do.

They choke in their own blood.

Sometimes they swallow them and slice up their stomachs.

Iâ€™m not lying.

Whatâ€™s wrong with you?

Whew, whew, whew, whew, whew...

Whatâ€™s wrong? Are you okay?

Yeah.

Are you sure?

Are you with Michelle?

Yeah.

I thought the two of you werenâ€™t friends anymore?

I changed my mind. Weâ€™re friends.

I have to go.

We have so much candy...

Here, you can have it,

Sit down, Angel.

Michelle will share her candy with you.

No, I won't.

Yes, You will.

Iâ€™ll share mine.

Thank you.

youâ€™re welcome.

Michelle.

Lord, thank you for blessing us with this meal and this home.

Help us all to lead a virtuous life.

Forgive my girls their sins

and help protect them from themselves.

Amen.

[Everyone says Amen except Michelle]

Pass the cheese.

Oh! God.

Iâ€™ll take that, go, play.

Sheâ€™s bad.

Michelle is a bad girl. Stay away from her.

See what she did?

She cut me and sheâ€™ll cut you, too.

Deborah! Get away from her.

What did she tell you?

Nothing.
Nothing?

She said you cut her.

Sheâ€™s a big fat liar.

Then what happened to her?

She did it to herself.

People do that, you know.

They hurt themselves and blame other people.

Why would she do that?

Because sheâ€™s stupid.

She got dropped on her head when she was a baby.

Canâ€™t you tell?

Rachel! Your dadâ€™s here.

Okay everyone I need to make an announcement.

There was an accident.

Saturday night after the carnival,

Hazel Marie cut her mouth

really badly when she bit into a candy bar that

someone had put a razor blade in.

So I need you guys to take this home,

show to your parents and have them

either check out all your candies or throw all away.

Yes Michelle.

What kind of candy bar was it?

I donâ€™t knowâ€¦

Is she dead?

No, no! Of course not.

Does she still have a tongue?

Michelle!

Thatâ€™s not even funny.

I told you.

Thatâ€™s Hazel Marieâ€™s ball.

Itâ€™s mine now.

Did you hurt her? Did you give her that candy?

Why would I do that?

Iâ€™ll come home with you after school, okay?

I told my mom I was eating at your house tonight.

You can't. I havenâ€™t asked my dad.

He wonâ€™t mind.

Why do you care so much from your friend?

Why canâ€™t you find someone else.

Donâ€™t forget about the lipstick.

Rachel, do you mind staying after class for a little bit?

Teacherâ€™s pet, teacherâ€™s pet.

Maybe she knows.

Thanks.

You know why I want to talk to you?

Iâ€™m kinda worried about you, Rachel.

I mean, you seem nervous and tired.

Oh.

Is there something bothering you?

You know, something I can help with?

No.

Are you sure?

'Coz Iâ€™ll listen to anything.

I mean anything.

Okay.

Itâ€™s okay.

I have something for you.

Itâ€™s a mood ring;

I know kind of a silly name huh?

Itâ€™s in a shape of butterfly and I know how you love butterflies.

So how it works is,

if it turns black,

that means youâ€™re tense or worried.

But if it turns blue,

that means that youâ€™re peaceful and calm.

Well, youâ€™re gonna have to try real hard to turn it blue.

You take a lot of deep breaths.

Just try not to worry so much okay?

Okay.

Okay, Iâ€™ll see you tomorrow.

Thanks!

What did she want?

Nothing.

Can I have that?

No!

Itâ€™s boring here.

And your house is ugly.

In Los Angeles, we lived in a nice apartment.

With wooden floors and arches in the ceiling.

There was a fountain in the courtyard.

Apartments are for poor people.

Ooh!

Whatâ€™s in there?

Iâ€™m not supposed to go in there.

Michelle, stop! We canâ€™t go in there.

This is a good hide out.

Yuck! Gas.

Want to sip?

Donâ€™t!

This could scratch really good.

Donâ€™t you think?

Okay. Letâ€™s go.

Donâ€™t be such a baby.

Iâ€™m not a baby.

See yah.

Michelle!!

Michelle!! Let me out, Let me out!!

Let me out, Let me out!! Let me out!!

Michelle.

You are a big baby.

Hey, Allison.

What?

I like your necklace.

My sister gave it to me.

Can I have it?

What?

No!

I want it.

Who cares?

Letâ€™s play a prank on them.

Hold this side.

No.

Hold it or Iâ€™ll tell.

Why did you do that?

Donâ€™t leave!

If you leave, Iâ€™ll tell.
I donâ€™t care!

If you leave, something bad will happen.

Something awful,

something bad could happen and it will be all your fault.

Please donâ€™t call the police.

I donâ€™t want to go to jail.

Iâ€™m sorry. I didnâ€™t mean to steal. Iâ€™ve lost mine.

Shhh!! Just calm down.

Iâ€™m sorry. Donâ€™t hate me.

Oh! God, no.

Itâ€™s okay.

Lipstick?

Why would she steal your lipstick?

She hasnâ€™t stolen anything before.

She misses her mom.

I miss her mom too.

I know.

Iâ€™m just saying that itâ€™s not about the lipstick.

I thought coming here

would help her, you know,

At least help her forget.

Sheâ€™s not gonna forget.

But itâ€™s safer here. Itâ€™s better.

Better for who?

I donâ€™t know what to do.

She thinks you donâ€™t listen to her.

I listen.

Sheâ€™s unhappy.

Sheâ€™s scared.

She just really needs her dad to listen to her.

Even if he doesnâ€™t like what heâ€™s hearing.

Thank you!

Sure!

I shouldnâ€™t have kept your things packed up so long, huh.

I told her.

Sheâ€™s gone.

Allison is gone.

She never got home last night.

No one can find her.

Donâ€™t ever accept any rides

or gifts from strangers.

Donâ€™t walk home alone.

And if you see anyone

that you donâ€™t recognize,

please tell an adult you trust.

Did Allison run away?

Or is she kidnapped?

Michelle.

Did she die?

Michelle, Thatâ€™s enough!

Iâ€™m here for my daughter. She has a dentist appointment.

No, I donâ€™t!

Michelle, Iâ€™m not gonna tell you twice.

We have something right now.

Let go!
I have to go to the bathroom.

No! No! Class! YoBack to your seats.

Dad! Let go! Youâ€™re hurting me.

Shut up! Keep your mouth shut!

Let go!
Stop biting me. Go!

Let go!

Do you have something to tell me?

Do you have something to tell me??

I want my old things back.

Do you know what happened to that little girl?

Do you know what happened to her?

This is all your fault.

You hate me.

Get in. Get in.

No blue yet, huh?

What if they donâ€™t find her?

Theyâ€™re gonna find her.

Everythingâ€™s gonna be fine.

Sheâ€™s probably went somewhere with her dad.

Maybe he took her on a trip and forgot to tell anybody.

Yeah. Maybe.

Something bad happened to her.

No. No. No.

Everythingâ€™s gonna be fine.

You already said that.

Bug, Letâ€™s talk about something else, okay?

Heâ€™s trying to kill me.

Heâ€™s trying to kill me. Please help me.

Who did this, Michelle?

He wants me dead.

Heâ€™s always wanted me dead.

Who?

Daddy.

He did this to you?

You donâ€™t believe me?

Of course, we believe you.

Then why arenâ€™t you calling the police?

I know how he died.

What are you talking about?

Your brother, Dennis.

I saw him do it.

I saw daddy put the box in the ground.

That is not funny, Michelle.

Oh my God!

Where did you get this?

Iâ€™ll show you where he is.

No, stay here.

No!
Stay here.

[On the phone] I think so. Iâ€™m not...

Daddy, daddy. We gotta go!

[On the phone] Iâ€™m sorry, I got to go.

Up here.

Itâ€™s under here.

Abby, stop!

Poor little baby.

Oh my God!

Oh my God!

Poor little boy!

Are they done yet?
Yeah.

I always knew that this day would come.

I just didnâ€™t think it would feel so meaningless, you know?

He was so close,

here all along.

Itâ€™s over now.

No!

No. Itâ€™s not over.

I want Steven Lowe to pay for what he did.

Abby,

You donâ€™t know if he did it or not.

But Michelle said, she saw him put Dennis into the ground.

You know, she couldnâ€™t have seen anything.

She wasnâ€™t even born yet.

I want you to be my best friend again.

On the outside, theyâ€™re pretty ugly.

But on the insideâ€¦
They hurt themselves and blame other people.

Sometimes I feel like time is frozen and I canâ€™t move.

Thatâ€™s Hazel Marieâ€™s ball. Itâ€™s mine now.
I like your necklace. Can I have it?

Please say â€œYesâ€

Allison?

Donâ€™t worry. Youâ€™ll be okay. Everything will be okay.

I can save you, I can save you.

Let us out, Let us out! Daddy, daddy!

Let us out! Daddy Daddy!!

[Music playing]

Daddy! Let us out! Daddy!! Daddy!

[Music playing]
Daddy Help!

Help me please!

Daddy!

Daddy!

Rachel!

Daddy!
Rachel!

Let us out!
Can you hear me?

Help! Daddy! Daddy!

C'mon! Goddammit!

Let us out! Daddy!

Daddy! Daddy!
Rachel!

Hold on. Just hold on.

Are you okay?

C'mon,

Rachel?

C'mon, baby.

Câ€™mon bug.

Rachel?

Câ€™mon bug.

Rachel!

C'mon baby!

Mom?

Hi! Itâ€™s me.

Whereâ€™s daddy?

Oh, He went to get a cup of coffee. Heâ€™ll be back in a couple of minutes.

What happened to Allison?

Oh! Sheâ€™s gonna be fine.

But how are you feeling?

Did she catch her?

Who?

Michelle.

You saw her?

She is a bad person inside of her.

Just lie back for a bit longer and close your eyes, okay?

There are bad people in this world.

I see them.

They live inside other people but I see them.

Honey, Thatâ€™s just your imagination playing tricks on you.

No. I see Miranda inside of her.

Miranda Lowe is dead.

When good people die,

They go back to the place where they came from,

Back to the grass and trees and sky,

like mom.

Sheâ€™s not here.

Sheâ€™s not coming back.

But bad people stay.

Iâ€™m gonna get the nurse.

Abby.

What?

Miranda killed your brother, not Mr. Lowe.

Guess what, bug?

You can go home now.

They said youâ€™re okay.

Do I have to talk to the sheriff?

Not today.

Lets get outta here, okay?

Please donâ€™t let her come back for me.

Youâ€™re safe.

Nothing is gonna happen to you, I promise.

There are people who never really leave.

They just find somewhere else to go.

Hi.

How is she?

She still wonâ€™t open her eyes.

So, she hasnâ€™t said anything yet?

Doctor says itâ€™s some sort of a coping mechanism.

I donâ€™t know.

But sheâ€™s gonna be alright.

She lost some blood, not much.

Her cuts are infected.

Like little criss-crosses.

Like somebody was trying to scratch her.

I mean, who would do something like that?

Mrs. Lowe?

Mrs. Lowe.

Mr. Lowe?

You think I killed him, donâ€™t you?

I thought you wereâ€¦
... in jail?

Miranda

was the most perfect baby.

Do you remember her?

So beautiful.

Little ray of sunlight

before she got sick.

She...

suffered

so much,

like it was our fault

when she started acting out.

She started doing these terrible things.

We found her fish dead;

She killed the pets, hamster.

These werenâ€™t accidents; she did it to be cruel.

She destroyed everything. Toys, pets, clothes,

she hurt other children.

But I wouldnâ€™t let her be punished. She suffered enough.

Miranda?

Miranda!

Miranda, I told you to stay in the house,

Câ€™mon, câ€™mon, câ€™mon. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

No!!!

What did you do?

He was gone when I found him.

All I could think about was my little girl.

I had to protect her so

I put him in a box and I buried him.

Maybe I wanted someone to find him someday.
I donâ€™t knowâ€¦

I thought I could help her.

Nothing changed. I could see it in her eyes.

So full of hate.

One night, she got to Deborah, my angel.

Noooo!!!

I got you, I got you!

No!
I got you, I got you.

Itâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s okay. Are you all right? I got you. I got you...

Oh, God! Miranda? Sweetheart? Sweetie?

Noooâ€¦Noooo...Noooâ€¦

It was a mistake.

It was a horrible mistakeâ€¦

And no one knew?

She been sick so long; it wasnâ€™t hard to arrange.

And now, itâ€™s happening again.

God is punishing us.

How are you feeling bug?

Are you all right?

Whatâ€™s going to happen to Michelle?

Sheâ€™ll be fine. Donâ€™t worry.

Is she going to jail?

No. No, of course not.

Maybe she should.

Rachel! Thatâ€™s not a very nice thing to say.

I could have helped them.

Who?

Mom and Hazel and Allison.

I see the people inside. They want to do bad things.

I see Miranda inside of Michelle.
Rachel.

Listen, We are gonna find some help, okay?

Whatever these thoughts are, weâ€™re gonna make them go away.

You canâ€™t make them go away!

Where is Michelle?

When she was little, sheâ€™d say the craziest things.

I want my room back, I want my things.

She played piano without ever taking a lesson. I mean, she knew things.

Where is Michelle?

Sheâ€™s gone. Bernice took her.

Where?

I... I donâ€™t know. Away.

She thinks she can protect her.

She thinks she can save her.

From you?

From everyone.

From herself.

Itâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s okay.

Boo!

It wonâ€™t hurt if you donâ€™t move.

This is mine now. Okay.

We got into a car accident.

My mom ran off the road.

I think she might be dead like your mom.

Are you afraid?

You should be!

Rachel!

Michelle!

Stop!

Michelle, I said stop it.

Michelle stop it.

Just give me the knife.

I do terrible things. Why?

I donâ€™t know.

What am I?

Youâ€™re a little girl.

Youâ€™re a very good little girl.

Oh, Michelle.

What are you looking at?

What do you see?

Tell me what you see,

Tell me what you see!

I see whatâ€™s inside of you,

I can see her.

Whatâ€™s wrong with me?

Youâ€™re bad inside.

But itâ€™s not your fault.

You donâ€™t have to do this.

You can fight her.

Mirandaâ€™s bad, not you.

I know it.

Youâ€™re good Michelle.

See, Mirandaâ€™s leaving.

She's gone.

No! Donâ€™t!
Gaah...

Oh, God!

Noâ€¦

Rachel?

Oh noh...

Are you okay?

Abby?

Abby?

Wake up... wake up...
Sweetie...

Abby,

Abby, hang in there.

Just hang in there, okay?

Iâ€™m sorry.

Please forgive me.

Iâ€™m sorry.

Thank you so much.

Itâ€™s okay bug.

Rachel,

do you want to tell me anything else about Michelle?

Did she die?

Daddy wonâ€™t tell me.

She did.

I could have helped them.

None of these was your fault, Rachel.

I didnâ€™t say it was my fault.

I just know what I see now.

Whatâ€™s that?

Evil.

Tell me about that.

You canâ€™t stop it by hurting other people.

You can only stop it by knowing whatâ€™s inside.

I could have helped her.

I could have made her understand.

Understand what?

I want to be a doctor, like you.

How do I do that?

This was his favorite place to play.

Are you gonna bury him here?

No, Heâ€™ll be at the cemetery with mom and dad... and Gran.

Daffodils are my favorite.

Theyâ€™re mine too.

Hey, bug.

Make a wish?

Be careful. Make sure the wind doesn't...

Whatâ€™s wrong bug?

Nothing.
