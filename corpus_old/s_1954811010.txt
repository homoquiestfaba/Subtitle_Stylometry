       ï¿½ To you Claire ï¿½

Hey Claire, make a wish.

             Make it a good one.

Don't be afraid to be selfish.

Who wants cake?
                           I do.

All righty,
starting South Beach tomorrow.

Yeah, that's how I feel.

             So, you're 29, huh?
    Oh, God, I know, I'm 29.

   Astrologically,
   29 is the most important year

              in a woman's life.
Yeah, well, astrologically...

Want some cake?
It's Claire's birthday.

           It doesn't need to be
           about food, Mom.

Woo, tickle Daisy.

           Happy B-day, C.B.
      Thank you, Steve.

          How are you?
Great.

              Hi.

                 Hi, little one.

             You look very chic.
    Thank you.

I'm in the middle
of my upper east side
Manhattan phase.

           Oh, right.

Ooh, Sharon.
                         Tim.

Hey, Daisy.
                    Hi, Tim.

Up top, buddy.
                         Really?

Yeah.

               And a bump. Nice.

                      Well done.

             I see you haven't
             tried the cake yet.

            Not yet.

  It's just that I brought it.

        Sharon, I will.

Can you not yell at me
     in front of Daisy?

  She picks up on the tension.

                Did I yell?

Cheers.
    Cheers. Happy birthday.

We're not supposed to love
one person, you know?

                   Yes. Totally.
   Me.

Me, I'm going to love
one person for five years,

and then another,
and then another, and...
                         Cool.

So, what'd you wish for?

      Wishes are private.

          Hey, you didn't
          get your birthday hug.

Oh, I'm not really a hugger.

Claire always
leaves the family.
      Yeah.

                Christ.

          29.

                     59. Ugh.

               ï¿½ï¿½

Joanie!
                    Hey, El.

Better late than never.
                       Oh, hi.

         Thank God.
         Come on, dance with me.
           Sure.

                     Hey, Ellen.

Hey, sweetie.

     Thanks for your help.

Of course.
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for your mother.

   She's the sister I never had.

   Hey, lady.

Hey, hi.
             What did I say now?

Good to see you.
   Good to see you.

    This is the son I never had.

      Thank you.

          Mom?

How's the photography going?

Well, it took a while,
but I rebuilt my empire.

Plus, I'm taking classes
to become a medium.

     Wow.
Got to have
something to fall back on.

So you're going to be able
to tell when things
are going to happen?

No, that's a psychic.
A clairvoyant.

People who've crossed over
use as me as like a...

tuning fork.
Telephone.

        He talks to dead people.
      Wow.

  So, what have they taught you?

Just, try to eat more fiber,
smoke more marijuana.

         Oh, we don't do that.
Me neither.

     That's too long.
     People look at me too long.

It looks nice on you.
People like it.

I heard you get
a lot of compliments on it.

    Yeah, I know,
    but it's a distraction.

            I'm going to shower.
    Okay.

      I'm going to order dinner.

<i> Lewis?</i>

You've got to see this blanket
that Sharon got me.

    It's so cute.
 <i> I have to wash my legs before.</i>

       <i> I can't just count</i>
       <i> on the soap coming down.</i>

                         Oh, no.

Oh, Kendra.

        <i> Oh, the</i> New York Times.

       <i> I want to thank you guys</i>
       <i> for a great write up.</i>

           <i> You guys. Thank you.</i>

                 <i> Am I a genius?</i>

           <i> No more than you are</i>
           <i> for liking the book.</i>

      <i> I want to thank Claire</i>
      <i> out there</i>

      <i> for being there for me.</i>

         <i> Every step of the way,</i>
         <i> she's been there.</i>

I am loving these new towels.

           Shit.

It looks bad.

It is bad.

I don't even know how to...

       All right.

I don't think we should
live together anymore.

I don't think
we should stay together.

      I should have known
      when you got me a toaster.

I was trying to be nice.
           It's not nice, Lewis.

It was a stupid gift.

                     God.

I don't know how to do this.

There hasn't been a window.

Your mom's been
freaking out about the party,

Sharon's been
freaking out about the cake,

Kendra's been... being Kendra,
which makes you freak out.

   I have not been freaking out.

        Is that it?

     It's a lot of "it's."

       What?

            I'm sorry.

 Hey,
 it's just seven years, right?

     It's not Afghanistan.

I'm going to miss
your sense of humor.

I'm sor... sorry.

   I'm stupid.

      You already know
      what you're going to miss.

<i> I know, honey.</i>
  <i> That's terrible.</i>

         <i> I'm so sorry.</i>

            Yes.

           I agree.

      All right, sweetie.

I hope you get some rest.

        We love you.
                    We love you.

            Yeah.

      Okay. All righty.

             Bye.

              God.

       On her birthday.

          Other fish in the sea.

Bob, he's not a fish.

He's the man
she loved for seven years.

                     He's a boy.

And did you see something
between Sharon and Steve?

                      Yeah.

                      Sharon.
          Yeah.

   Are we having sex tonight?

   Yeah. Yeah.

You want to have sex tonight?

Boy, I wish
Kendra could meet someone nice.

              She's just a baby.

              You're so cute.

<i> I don't know.</i>

Sometimes I miss
the sound of a hairdryer.

         You can blow dry Zippy.

I think I will.

<i> It's your mother!</i>

         I can't talk.

       <i> She wants to know</i>
       <i> if you've called Claire.</i>

              No!

               She wants to know
               if you've tried.

            Is that my shirt?

                          No.

Mom,
Claire doesn't want to talk.

She says that
but she doesn't really mean it.

           <i> Well, then,</i>
           <i> let Claire say that.</i>

  <i> I have an audition here, Mom.</i>

            <i> Kendra. Uh, Kendra?</i>

           What, Mom?

             Please call Claire.

    Claire, Claire, Claire.

Come back later.

<i> Maintenance.</i>

Oh, my God.

     What?

                  Oh, I'm sorry,
                  Alex Cooper,

      I thought
      this was my sister's room.

What are you doing here?

                     Oh, Claire.

          Mom was worried.
          She, um, followed you.

           Why didn't
           you come to my house?

            It hurt my feelings.
    Sharon, please!

Really, can I just be
the hurt one right now, please?

               Of course.

                      I'm sorry.

Can you believe this happened?

           It's disgusting.

Like, he doesn't love me.
Fine.

But, I mean,
I don't love him either.

It's like,
you'd think he's so great

because he's so successful
and good looking.

   I'm a catch, too.

            Yes, you are.

         Really?
              Yes, you are.

    I see you're eating organic.

      Don't judge me.

       Is this
       all you brought with you?

     I didn't move in.
                           Okay.

          You know,
          I looked this place up

          on the bedbug registry
          and it is rated

         I'm not
         going to tell you what.

       Oh, God.

                 Absolutely not.
       Yes.

                No.

    But I need them.
                             No.

And do I need to pay for this
or have you already prepaid?

        Sharon, I'll pay for it.
                  Okay.

               Jesus!

  Will someone
  please move the recycle bin?

     You think
     they actually recycle?

How's the remodel going?

         I don't know.

     I've lost my instinct.

No, Sharon. It's great.

You've always been
who you were.

          Hey, Pavel.

Sharon, I really don't
want to see anybody today.

         And you won't.

Claire?

God, Sharon.
    I'm sorry, she wore me down.

  Oh, Claire.

   Hey Mom.
   I'm totally fine, really.
      Good.

She looks really sad.

             She's very worried.
             We all are worried.

    Uh, honey?

You look pretty.

           Thank you.

     Seriously,
     can you put your foot

    on the gas and let's go,
    please?

Open up, honey.
What's wrong with this thing?

Am I doing
something wrong here?

          It's baby locked, Mom.
               Oh, okay.

Kendra,
come say hi to your sister.

Come on.

                  Is that Mommy?

                 Is that Mommy?
    Look at that.

        How's my monkey?
        How's my monkey?

What time did she eat?
      She didn't cry for food.

     Does she have to cry?
     For food?

      Are you saying
      I'm starving our daughter?

  I'm not starving our daughter.
I'm saying...

Honey,
we got some good snacks inside.

Come on in.
Want something good to drink?

I just need like one second.

Okay, honey. Okay.

                           What?

  Get out of the car, Claire.

   I see Kendra's not committing
   to the sympathy march.

Don't fight.
Mom's going through enough.

     We're not fighting,
     Sharon, we're just...

       just not talking,
       that's all.

Listen, I wasn't
supposed to tell you this,

but Mom and Dad
have to sell their house.

             What?

Dad made
some horrible investments,

electric dog collars
or something like that.

              Oh, my God.

I know.

         What is that?

Oh, we're moving the pool.

<i> Front door closed.</i>

        That's driving me crazy.

         I've become so horribly
         sound sensitive lately.

 Even a leaf blower
 makes me want to shoot somebody

           or myself.

        When did I get this way?

Oh, Gosh, Sharon, I don't know.

                Come here, baby.

           Oh, God. Here she is.
           The breakup girl.

          Hey.<i> Mi casa, su casa.</i>

Hey, you seem okay.

             Really, do I?

       'Cause I don't feel okay.

Then you will be.
  Girls, love each other.

                    Mom, please.

Love these pistachios.

Yeah, I got to go,
I have rehearsal.

       Oh.

            All right. I'm fine.

 That's all I was trying to say.

   And, if it's any consolation,

        I always
        thought his beard was...

               just a little too
               well thought out.

         Thanks.

     Robertson was a mess today.

  He was downtown the other day,

     and there's a secret onramp
     northbound of the 101

just south of Alameda,
which is great.

          Beautiful blueberries.

      Low on the glycemic index,

              full of vitamin C,
              antioxidants.

Costco
had a huge giant clamshell

of these things for 5.99.
Unbelievable.

        You get, like,
        three gallons of pickles

            for, like, 37 cents.

 They have a travel agency, too.

        They're anti-depressant.

       Thanks. I'm okay.
           All right.

God, look at this house.

          This stuff.

It's just stuff, honey.

Sharon gets all the stuff.

             There's stuff
             Sharon doesn't get.

   Sort of took you by surprise,
   huh?

                   Yeah, me too.

       He didn't love me.

     He's nuts.
     Who wouldn't love you, huh?

   What's he going to do now,
   baby?

                   Dad.
                          Bob.

               It just happened.

          Can I speak?

Let her just breathe
for a minute.
             Don't ask her that.

  Christ,
  it's like I have four wives.

  Three wives, one's missing.

     I just was explaining
     that what's his name,

   Lewis, is gone,
   and she's going to have to be
   more independent.

Okay. All right.
That's enough.

Can we just please not talk
about Lewis for two seconds?

I mean,
there are more important things
going on in the world.

           There are, there are.
There's a crisis
in Yemen right now.

Did you hear about that?

And the E. coli,
you know, in...

                 Germany.
          Again with those guys.

   You just got to make the most
   of every minute.

 Take advantage of every second.

I don't want
to even hear his name, okay?

Did you hear that, Bob?
           Got it.

Oh, Esperanza, hi.

             <i> No mas,</i> Mr. Lewis?

          <i> No mas.</i>

    I will succeed.

<i> ï¿½ Oh ï¿½</i>

                    <i> ï¿½ Kendra ï¿½ </i>

                 <i> ï¿½ Oh, Kendra ï¿½</i>

                         <i> ï¿½ Oh ï¿½</i>

<i> ï¿½ Kendra ï¿½</i>

ï¿½ I'm at your window ï¿½

ï¿½ Kendra ï¿½

           Hey, Uri.

      I was in the neighborhood.

            You look amazing.

       I like your hair.

       I don't know.
       It came out a little red.

    Nah, it's fiery.

How's Dow?

                      He's okay.

Your roommate still evil?

              She stole my robe.

The one with the dragon on it?

          She swears she didn't.

                    It's okay...

       Hey, hey, come on.

     Look, I know
     when that mouth moves

a little bit to the side...

     I scared you.

I'm serious about love,
and that scares people.

I'm not ready, Uri.
                       Kendra!

  <i> ï¿½ Go away from my window ï¿½</i>

   <i> ï¿½ Go away from my door ï¿½</i>

     <i> ï¿½ Go away, way, way ï¿½</i>

     <i> ï¿½ From my bedside ï¿½ </i>

       <i> ï¿½ And bother me ï¿½</i>

          <i> ï¿½ No more ï¿½</i>

       <i> ï¿½ And bother me ï¿½</i>

          <i> ï¿½ No more ï¿½</i>

                 Hey, here I am.

                         Racing.
        Mommy's racing.

    You know, when I was running
    a company 70 hours a week,

  I was actually
  more calm than I am right now.

               Mommy was calmer.

So, okay, Mom,

     sometimes I'm okay,
     and sometimes I'm not,

      but I always
      have this awareness

 that my life is 99% better
 than most people in the world.

     99%.

              So, yes, I'm fine.

 I'm more than fine,
 but, you know, before all this,

         I had a life of my own.

      So, yeah, some days
      I just want to lay in bed,

            <i> and other days</i>
            <i> I want to run away.</i>

      <i> Other days I just</i>
      <i> want to F-U-C-K everyone.</i>

<i> I hear that.</i>

  She just means metaphorically,
  of course.

      <i> Pakistani officials</i>
      <i> publicly condemned</i>

 <i> the most recent drone attack,</i>

      <i> but diplomats here</i>
      <i> at the U.S. Embassy</i>

       <i> say they've heard</i>
       <i> talk privately</i>

       <i> that Pakistan</i>
       <i> remains committed</i>

    <i> to going after terror--</i>

So,
you know how I was telling you

I was starting to feel
a little purposeless

and people had asked me,
"What do you do?"

and I'd freeze?

      Mom,
      you take care of everyone.

Well, now,
I'm going to get paid for it.

This gal
I went to High School with

has started this new
errand business

in The Valley.

    Are you talking about a job?

Yup. That's me.

        Mom, if you need money--
No, uh-uh, no.

I...
There will be no more borrowing.

Dad promised.

                            Dad.
I'm telling you,

you're lucky
you have a husband

who won't give you any trouble,
ever.

                           I am.

                         I know.

                     It's great.

<i> ï¿½ï¿½</i>

        Hey Mom.
            <i> Oh, hi, Claire.</i>

<i> So, I went to the</i>
<i> farmer's market this morning,</i>
            Hi.

<i> and I saw</i>
<i> this really pretty plant,</i>

<i> and I thought, "That would</i>
<i> look great at Claire's,"</i>

<i> so I just decided</i>
<i> to quickly drop by.</i>

What?
                So, knock knock.

Are you in my...
                       Surprise.

       Oh. Hi.
                             Hi.

You're in my house right now.
                   That's right.

                 Hi, sweetheart.

         This is a succulent.
         It'll survive anything.

                 Very adaptable.

     Thank you. Thank you.

How are you? How's...
                           Okay.

How's Dad?

                 He's all right.
                 He's all right.

         So, what are you doing?

      What are you up to, there?

I'm just trying
to write this article for NPR.

                       Good.

  Speaking of writing,
  can you believe Lewis' book

     got on the<i> New York Times' </i>
     best seller list?

Yeah, Mom, I can
because I wrote half of it.
              Oh.

        Well, and you were doing
        your own thing, too.

No, I wasn't. I was
sitting around doing his--

          I was editing his blog
          for five years.

                  Who does that?

So you helped him.
Feel good about that.

Do you want to feel bad?
                            Yes.

          I want to feel shitty.

         Can I just feel shitty?

Yes, you can.

I'm going
to make your bed here.
                      Thank you.

God, I cannot wait
to give him back all the money

that I did not make
sitting around

just reading
his stupid boring words.

  If that's what you want to do.
          Yeah.

You know, when I'm working
and successful

and doing something great,

living in New York
and being a journalist
like I planned my entire life

until I met him
and I lost my imagination.

What am I so afraid of?

  Honey, sometimes we're
  just under people's spells.

 I was under your father's spell
 for a very long time.

Mom...
   Honey, it's just time for you
   to get out there

     and show everybody
     how fantastic you are.

Oh, God, Mom.
Everyone should feel about me
the way that you do.

  They would, Claire,
  if you would just let them.

Remember Debbie Reynolds?

   Ugh.
           You know what she did
           when she got shit on?

     She just got up and danced.

Mom! Please,
can we stop talking
about old famous people?

   Well,
   maybe I'll just stop talking.

             Okay.

     After I tell you one thing.

                   He called.

Who called?

     Lewis. He called the house.

   Wait, what?

        When?
            Oh, I don't remember
            the exact day.

Wait, why is he
calling my family?

             Honey, don't worry.
             It's not about you.

        He just needed
        to speak to your father.

Okay, so, wait,
he called, and then what?

                He dropped by.

       What?

You guys just stood around
and chatted?

About what? About how
he dumped me like cow shit?

                     Claire.
God, you're just...

You're so busy chatting,
you don't even--

            Wait a minute.
              Mom,

you told the butcher
when I got my first period.

      That was, like,
      a hundred years ago.

 You told the tennis instructor
 how much I weighed.

      Roger was a family friend.

Ellen knows everything.

        Ellen is my best friend.

Did you tell Sharon?

                        No.

Did you tell Kendra?

                 Absolutely not.
Oh, perfect. Great.

Now she can just sing a song
about me at her show.

     Speaking of which,
     you are going, right?

              Mom!

            Claire.
                        Mom.

She's your sister.
    I know she's my sister, Mom.

     So, what?
     Sharon and Kendra both knew

  and neither of them called me?

Would you have answered?

I can't remember a time
when one of you

wasn't hanging up on the other

or slamming the door
or walking out of a room.

Always misunderstanding.

Especially you, Claire.
              Me?

           Yes, you.

   Gosh, I just would love it
   if one of you

   would just call the other
   and say,

 "Hi, how are you?
 Fine, thank you. How are you?

    "I'm good,
    and thanks for calling.

      "Oh, you're good?
      Oh, you deserve it.

    "Oh, and you know what,

you look pretty in green."

        Pretty in green.
                 Yes.

        Pretty in green.

           I'm sorry.

            Oh, Mom.

          All I'm saying is that

       I know it's not Cambodia.

         I know it's not the end
         of the world,

     but, to me,
     it really feels like it is,

     and I just
     have to deal with it alone.

But where does it get you,
Claire?

All that strife and warfare?

And I know
I don't always say the words

that you want to hear,
but I feel them.

             I know you do, Mom.

                       Here.

             One more.
             That's it, no more.

                       Bam.

Bam.

Bam.

          Okay, Zippy,
          I'm going to get them.

Bam.

        I'm out of bullets, Zip.

         Running out of bullets.

It was nice of you to call.

            Oh, just missed you.

             Can't a father
             call his baby girl?

                 Honey...
What?

 Could you please
 break the ice with your sister?

Has she broken it with me?

I knew
there was a reason you called.

 She had just been going through
 a very rough time and I hear,

  and I cannot reveal the source
  to you,

           that you haven't been
           very supportive.

Uh-huh, who told you, Mom?
Sharon?

                      Esperanza.

        She tells me everything.

   What about me, Dad?

My last boyfriend before Uri
wanted me to pretend

   I was Jewel.

What's wrong with my voice?

    I can sing.

I have pain too, you know,
you don't have to live in a car
to feel pain.

        Oh, honey,
        I'm sorry you have pain.

Dad, I didn't get into the
Ashland Shakespeare Festival.

                No.
And with Claire and Lewis,

and Sharon and her remodels,

I can't even have
my own tragedy.

           Well, hey,
           we're looking forward
           to your show.

 Honey, your mother
 and I love you very, very much.

Do you, Dad?
                Uh-huh.

  'Cause sometimes I feel like
  I don't even have a family.

Sharon's always
too busy to talk to me

and Claire never calls me back,
she just texts me.

            I know.
I can talk to you,

  but you're not really there.

          Honey.
It's okay.

Sharon was the love child
and Claire was planned

and I was just the mistake.
It's totally--

            A wonderful mistake.

              No, not a mistake.
              I don't mean that.

      Come on. Sit down, please.

      I have something
      I want to tell you.

What, Dad? What?

            Well...
<i> Hey.</i>

        Sorry I'm late.

First I couldn't find my keys,

and then I couldn't find
my phone, and...

Anyway, doesn't matter.
I'm here now.

 You're here.
 Now we'll just wait for Claire.

            Claire.

                           Yeah.
              Oh.

  Hi.

       Always.

         Oh, God.
         Is there anything worse

          than driving to Venice
          on a Saturday?

         I know, right.

  I love Venice on a Saturday.

               Oh, good.

           My girls.

My beautiful girls.

   I'm glad you're all here.

How are you, honey?

I'm terrible. Terrible.

             Um...

                      What, Dad?

           I have...

              What, Dad?

Okay, I don't want you
to get upset about this.

             Okay.

      They found a lump...

          on my lung.

But you don't smoke.

             I should have, huh?

It's not funny.

  I'm not trying to be funny.
  I just wanted to say

  that the reason I called you
  here together

 is that I don't want
 your mother to know about it.

Yet.

      Now, I'll tell her
      when the time comes,

    when the time is right.

      I want us to all be
      on the same page
      about that now.

                           Okay?

She's off hiking
with her friend Ellen right now.

I don't understand.

   Kendra, let him--
   let him have his reasons.

             I'm sorry, Dad.
     Thank you, honey.

I'm sorry.
       I just wanna know
       what they are.

      It doesn't matter, Kendra.

So you're asking us to lie.
                Omit.

    I'm asking you to omit.
    I'm asking you
    not to say anything

   until I-- I say something.

 We're not telling her anything
 until we get you
 a second opinion.

I don't need a second opinion.
             We're gonna get you
             to a decent doctor

                and not the ones
                in your plan.
I don't need a second opinion.

         I'm asking you
         to help me.

       What kind of ca--
       What do you have?

      How-- How bad is it?

              What are we
              gonna do about it?

        There's nothing
        to do about it.

         Yes, there is.

Daddy...

         are you dying?

Kendra.

       I suppose so.

                    Here you go.

But not till I eat this.

I know.

          I just wanna know
          if we're gonna
          talk about it.

            Everybody
            grieves differently.

           I just wanna know
           if she's gonna
           talk about it.

 I just don't talk about things
 the way you do, Kendra.

          No, you run away.

                        Damn it.

          I've gotta pick up
          Daisy from drum class.

You're leaving?
                  Oh, shit.

Jesus. I gotta go.

My, uh, car
is on the street, so...

     Okay.

Shit.

          Eight bucks.

           How much?

                          Eight.
              Eight.

There you go, darling.

Thank you.

There's my girl.

Let's get you
out of there.

Yeah. Good girl.

Come on.

Let's go see
what's going on.

Let's go see
what's going on.

Oops. Oh, yeah.

          Ow.

There you go.

<i> Kitchen door open. </i>

Sharon?

     <i> Kitchen door closed.</i>

Yeah. Okay.
                 You know what?
                 Forget it.

Hey, K.B.

                      Hi, Steve.

Sharon likes me
to wear these.

Um...

         Esperanza, can you run
         a bath for her, please?

     Okay.
                      Thank you.

Kendra.

              Forgot your phone
              at the restaurant.
Ohh!

Tsk! I can't believe I did that.
Can you believe this?

I can believe it.

           Anyway, I didn't mean
           to act like,

      you know, the Dad thing
      wasn't a priority for you.

It's fine.

                     It's just--
Really.

        What am I supposed to do
        if Mom asks
        why I'm acting weird?

You're gonna
have to do some acting.
You're an actress.

               Right. Right.

     Act about what?

                        Nothing.

Just...

              My dad has cancer.

What?

                 Sharon?
Kendra, sit down.

         I don't wanna sit down.

    Why didn't you tell me?

            Ohh.
I didn't wanna say it.

                           Lung.

Oh, I-- I'm so sorry.
If there's, uh,

             anything we can do,
             obviously...

             Some things
             you just can't fix.

No-- Of course.

   I don't suggest that I
   have the cure for cancer.
   I'm just--

   I just meant that if things--
   when things get dicey--

                 They are dicey.

     He meant dicier.
                             I--

Dicier.

                  Okay, well...

          I need to go feed Dow.

                     Yeah.

              Who's-- Who's Dow?

Her fish.
                      Her fish.

Kendra...

So, did you talk
to Claire?

           No, but I don't wanna
           talk about Claire
           when she's not here.

Okay.

Hey.

          I tried to call, but--
What do you need, Lewis?

        I feel really bad
        about everything, and...

       You all packed?
Uh...

A few things. Yeah.
I just...

I thought the sooner,
the better.

    Oh, I just mean that it'd be
    easier for you to move on.

I didn't wanna move on,
Lewis.

I was happy.

             No, you weren't.

      So I'm the bad one, right?
Yes!

Yes, you're the bad one,
Lewis!

I...

     I got you that shirt.

     Hey, Claire,
     I, uh, just wanted to say
     I spoke with the landlord--

Oh, fuck off.

                       Cool.

          Here we go.
          Oh, FYI,

   Aloha Gym/Spa
   is half price on Mondays.

   And I hear that cucumber bath
   at the Oasis

           is out of this world.

Uh, yes,
there is spear fishing,

but you've gotta get
a license first.

Snack bar's open till 4:00.

Room service is available.
But $12 for a papaya.

         So...
                           Yeah.

Kids, there's an arcade
and dolphins--

Oh, and I got you some gum.

    You never wanna buy this
    at the airport.

Highway robbery.
Get in the car.

                Say "thank you."
                      Thank you.

You're welcome.
Didn't you all have a red bag?

Oh, shit.
I thought you had it.
I told you to get the bag.

                 Hello, Officer.
                 How are you?
Hello. How are you?

              We're leaving
              right this minute.
Okay.

            I saw the temporary
            "no parking" signs--
Mm-hmm.

             ...but these people
             actually live here,

             and this was just
             a 15-second pickup.

                 I'm taking them
                 to the airport.

   But as you see,
   their car is in the driveway,

      so I could not park there,
      because

they don't want people to know
  they're gonna be away.

Right.
      So, I couldn't park there.

        This was my only option.

Yeah, but this is the one place
you can't park, though.

            But you know what?
            We're leaving now.
            So no harm, no foul.

               We're outta here.
               Oh, great, honey.

        Thank you.
        Could you do me a favor?
        This is a little sticky.

       Could you?
       I'd really appreciate it.
Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

                All right. Good.
                Oh, thank you.

See this little petoolah?

           How cute is she, huh?
   Yeah.

That's my granddaughter Daisy.

She's adopted.

Not being able
to have a child--

it just tore my daughter,
Sharon, apart.

Okay, seat belts, everybody.

You know, I just wanna
    thank you for listening.

   So few people do anymore.

All right. Have a good day.
     Drive safe.

       Off to the races.
       Here we go.

So, what's Dad
up to today?

     Oh, staying out of trouble,
     hopefully.

          He calls all day long.

      "Where are you?
      When are you coming home?"

                Then I get home,
                he doesn't talk.

Well, maybe he just
needs you there.

               He's-- He's okay.

I have a theory about why Dad
   doesn't want Mom to know.

He's got his head
in the sand.

                No, it's because
                it's a secret.

        You know, everybody's
        just gotta have a secret
        from somebody else

  so the other person can be mad
  when the secret comes out.

    It's like, you know,
    it just should've never been
    a secret in the first place.

I saw Mom earlier.
It was horrible.

           Oh, God. I'm avoiding
           her calls completely.

Kendra's having
a hard time with it.

              Are you...
              talking to Kendra?

Well, not talking talking,
but...

I don't think we should
talk about Kendra
when she's not here.

                     Okay. Um...

                     I gotta go.

Hey, uh, we should,
um, talk more.

               Yeah. Definitely.
   Call me.

                   Okay. I will.

     Sharon, I really
     don't want Daisy
     seeing you smoking a joint.

    She's eight months old.

           Patti Smith remembers
           her mother's screams
           when she was born.

  Since when do you
  start reading<i> Rolling Stone?</i>

I do.

              How are your
              fantastic parents?

Fine. Yeah,
everyone is really--

    I remember your dad
    came down to the campus jail

        to bail me out of a DUI.

              He's the greatest.

           He is.

       And how are your sisters?
       Are they still weird?

            Um...

You know,
they're not weird, actually.

Uh, Sharon is doing really well.

   She has a baby now,
   which is really exciting.

And Kendra is still acting,

and she's actually
really talented--
                        Hey.

       Oh, my God.

                    Yeah.

Oh, my God.
                    I signed it.

          Oh, my God.

Kate, this is just amazing.

It's so heavy.

             I had to cut a lot.
         Really?

            I can't tell you
            how many dead bodies
            I've seen.

         Kate...

  This is so awkward. I...

You know,
we came up together...

    and I introduced you
    to the newsroom

      and all those people
      that I knew--

     I'm so sorry
     they couldn't keep us both.

   Yeah. Yeah.
   That was really hard.

           Um...

 You know, I didn't really have
 the thick skin for it,

   and I think that I do now.

      So... I've decided
      to move to New York.

      Okay. Um, I don't
      really know anybody,

  and it would be really great
  to have a friend.

And if you could, you know,
maybe put in a good word for me
or something,

I feel like--
                    Wow.

            That's a big move.

               And you're 29.

           But I will definitely
           ask around.

        Thank you.

            Sometimes...
            we miss our calling.

      Yeah. We do.

   <i> ï¿½ Then I could be happy ï¿½</i>

          <i> ï¿½ Hee hee ï¿½</i>

           <i> ï¿½ Happy ï¿½</i>

          <i> ï¿½ Hee hee ï¿½</i>

       <i> ï¿½ Oh, so happy ï¿½</i>

          <i> ï¿½ Hee hee ï¿½</i>

           <i> ï¿½ Happy ï¿½</i>

It's my dad.

They found something
on his lung.

                           No...

And we're not allowed
to talk about it.

So now we're not talking
even more than when not talking.

And I just feel so alone.

               You're not alone.
               Kendra--

    I--
                         Kendra!

<i> ï¿½ï¿½</i>

         How you doing?

     Okay.

                Anyone talk
                to your mom yet?

No, not yet.

I called, but I hung up.

         Doesn't seem very fair.

I have to respect
my dad's wishes.

       And what about P-A-V-E-L?

        Are you gonna
        R-E-S-P-E-C-T P-A-V-E-L?

What are you talking a--
Oh, God.

You heard that?
            On the baby monitor.

               Yeah. I heard it.
     Ohh!

Steve, that--

that's just
a figure of speech.

                   "I wanna f"--

 "I wanna F-U-C-K everyone else"
 is not a figure of speech.

   You can check any phrase book
   anyplace in the world.

 Like, is "I wanna fuck everyone
 else" a figure of speech?
I'm sorry.

             No, never heard it.
             Mm-hmm.

Look, I've got
a lot of stuff on my mind.

            Okay, let's hear it.
            Okay.
Okay.

And I feel that we
are at a crossroads.

          What? Come on, Sharon.

                   "Crossroads"?

  Do you remember when we
  used to drink and have fun?

       Yeah. So you know what?
       Let's drink and have fun.

            I can't.

I don't know why,
but I can't.

      Why are we always--
      Why are we always
      moving windows?

To fill the void?

                "Fill the void?"

My head is burning.
           Sharon, take a class.

I don't want to take a class.
       You need
       intellectual stimulation.

Hitler is not an aphrodisiac.
That's all I'm saying.

       I don't wanna run around
       worrying about
       how to turn you on, okay?

           Hopefully, I just--
           Hopefully, I just do.

Well, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize
you were running around,

worried about
how to turn me on.
              No, no. No. Mm-mm.

   You're twisting. Don't twist.
I've never seen you
worry about that.

      That's not what I-- Mm-mm.
      That's not what I said.

Why is the TV always on?
            The TV is my friend.

That was mean.

I wanna get a job.
                    Okay.

I can't leave Daisy.
                   Okay.

I hate everything
I say.

                Okay.

Oh...

ï¿½ You stayed
through wear and tear ï¿½

ï¿½ Through every busted day ï¿½

ï¿½ An angel to my devil ï¿½

ï¿½ Kept my secrets tucked away ï¿½

So stylish.
Oh, my goodness.

            My stylish daughter.
  Oh...

   Ohhh!
       That's my beautiful girl.

Yeah.

          So...

  have you talked to Mom?

              Soon, honey. Soon.

     No need to worry a worrier.

       And how about you?
       How are you doing?

          Fine. Good. Feel good.

Really?
                Yeah. Really.

   You're gonna get this back...
   with interest.

Oh, really, Dad,
what's the point of having it
if you can't share it?

              That's right.

ï¿½ You never ran, thank God ï¿½

  ï¿½ You stuck by me ï¿½

ï¿½ Angels are looking down
and watching over me ï¿½

ï¿½ Angels are looking down
and watching over me ï¿½

Yes, they are.

Robert!

       I didn't know
       you were coming in today.

   I just wanted to check in,
   say hello.

Hey, Doc.
    Hey, Bob.
    How you feeling?

             Well, I'm good.
             I feel good.

                    Have a seat.
Okay.

        Do you want some coffee?
            Oh, sweetheart, yes.

Um, Dad,
we don't really call nurses
"sweetheart" anymore,

because it's not 1910.

                   No, we don't?
                   No, we don't.
    Mm-mm.

Okay.

            Okay?
                         Mm-hmm.

Okay.

Dad...

why is Lewis calling you?

    We just had some business...
    to tie up--

What kind of business?
                    Well...

we, uh, made a little investment
together last year.

              Koa. K-O-A. Koa.

         The most beautiful wood
         in the world...

  grows on the top of a mountain
  in Kauai.

        When harvested properly,
        it's worth a fortune.

                And I had an in.

          I told Lewis about it,

  and he decided that he wanted
  to make an investment with me.

                            Huh.
               Okay.

So, what happened with it, then?

          Well, it's a very
          complicated operation.

          You need lumberjacks
          to cut the trees down.

       Then you need helicopters
       to bring the trees
       down off the mountain.

        Then it turns out
        that the guy on the hill
        is a pot farmer.

He was emotionally unstable.

                  He was a mess.

           It was gonna
           make us zillionaires.

  Oh, Dad.
           I know.
           You wanna yell at me.

           I can feel it.
           Go ahead. Yell at me.

It's okay.

         I wanna yell at me.

       All right, Bob. Let's get
       some deep breaths, okay?
     Okay.

Deep breath in,
               deep breath out.

There you go.

                     Hello.

             <i> Hey.</i>

           Hey. Hey, Claire.

                         Um, hi.

             I was just calling,

             'cause, uh,
             my dad just told me

            about the Koa thing.

    So I-- I guess I just wanted
    to say thank you,

         <i> I guess.</i>

Yeah. I mean, he--
You know, he's an impossible guy
to turn down.

Yeah.

            I, uh--
            I meant to call you.

     <i> Meaning to call you. </i>
              Really?

  <i> I-- I, uh--</i>
  <i> I heard about him being sick,</i>
