<i>(Chet)
Something I never said to you.</i>

â™ª

â™ª I'm looking for a love â™ª

IA love that's real,
a love that's real â™ª

Dad's gonna catch you
carrying on like that.

â™ª I'm looking for a love â™ª

Get off my bed!

<i>Hey, turn that music off!
Lights out.</i>

See. I told you.

Why's he get so mad'?

It's too much for him, Todd.

You gotta calm down.

Ew, what's this'?

It's mine. Give it back.

I wanna see it!
No.

They're all guys!

Leave it alone. Go to sleep.

Scoot over!

Get on your own bed.
No.

Todd! Seriously, stop it.

Stop!

Stop! Give it!

I wanna see it!
You can't!

Yes, I can!
Quiet.

What in God's name
is going on in here'?!

You..
You're a nasty little boy!

It's not mine!

Shut up!

<i>I don't Wanna hear</i> it...

<i>Pm not raising
some Mile sissy boy...</i>

<i>You'll be gone
and I Won't even know you...</i>

<i>What are people going to say?...</i>

<i>You ever think about us?
Me and your brother?</i>

[horn honking]

<i>(Chet)
What did you want for me'?</i>

<i>What did you hope for me'?</i>

We can come back
if you'd rather us-

No, no, sorry. Ignore me.
I'm just... zoning out.

This is never easy.

It's been three months now.

I don't know why I'm-

Hey, come on.
It takes a while to let go.

You're all set.

Oh.

It's all itemized so..

Thank you.

Anything else'?
Uh, no. Thanks.

Wait.

Maybe I could buy you
a drink or something'?

Uh... that's okay.
This is our job.

Right, of course. Yeah.

Thank you.

All right, you'll need
quarter round.

Eight feet each.

No tens'?

I don't think we carry tens.
Your father had ten.

Well, I can order.
No, just give me six of those.

Make it seven.
I'll screw one up, I'm sure.

Goddamn I miss him,
rest his soul.

How's the Missus'?

Good, good.

The grand kids are giving
her a run for the money.

That's what they do.

Don't let him
walk off with these, Ann.

Son,
when you gonna get yourself

some children and a wife'?

Must be awfully lonely up at
the cabin without your father.

Bring your truck around back.

JosÃ© and I will load you up.

All right Don,
let's just call it ninety even.

A man shouldn't live alone.

He just likes to keep
focused on the store.

[TV audio in background]

What?

<i>(Chet)
Did it matter that I stayed?</i>

<i>If I had left...</i>

<i>like he did?</i>

[bamboo wind chimes]

Who gave you that'?

I did.

I took it from
a girl in my class.

That's a girl's toy.

I don't care.

Race you to the fort.

<i>We've gotta level with you.</i>

<i>It's just not good
for our relationship.</i>

Ok. Yeah, I get it.

<i>You deserve more, Todd.</i>

Like what'? A foursome'?

We knew you'd understand.

It's been a great summer.

Oh, come on man,
where am I supposed to...

I didn't steal anything!..

This is fucking bullshit.

Oh, give me a fucking...
What is your problem'?

[horns beeping]

What the fuck
are you looking at'?

Dick!

[sirens in distance]

Good morning, Mr Waters.
Hi, Christine.

Chet Waters'?

Well, all right then!

Brandon, what are you... wow.

Chet Waters.

Do you still live around here'?

Yep, same place.

Run my dad's hardware store.
Wow. That's crazy.

Yeah. Yeah.

Are you...
back for a visit or...

I'm probably gonna
be here for awhile.

My mom's not doing so well.

Oh, right, sorry to hear that.
Yeah.

A stroke, right'?

We didn't want
to put her in a home

and I can work from anywhere.

Yeah, that's, that's good,
that's generous of you.

I mean she's your mom...
but yeah...

So...
are you into men or multi'?

Oh, yeah, yeah, good.

I just... you hear so much

about iron-free
formulas these days and...

yeah, I sound ancient.

Just get the senior formula
and call it a day.

Yeah.

We should get a drink or
something, you know, catch up.

Oh, right, I gotta
get back to the store...

Not now.
Right, yes...

What's your number'?

Oh, it's 805-555-3124.

So crazy running into you.

You look good.

[cell phone rings]

Now you got my number.

Oh.
Wow, ooh, a flip phone.

That's old school.

Ah, yeah. Just keepin' it real.

Call me.

JosÃ©! I told you..

JosÃ©?

QuiÃ©n es JosÃ©'?

He's our stock boy.

What'?
You're hiring gay chulos now'?

Dad would be very proud.
He's not...

Surprise!

Aren't you happy to see me'?

Of course I am.

Then come here, baby.

He never ever paid me on time.

I was so over that job anyway.

But man, what a send-off.

That kid had the
biggest fucking... Ann!

Look at you, foxy as ever.

No wonder my dad
had the hots for you.

Oh Todd, stop it.

Wow, wow, what a surprise.

And what is...
Yeah, it's real.

Oh, what has
LA done to my boy'?

LA rode me hard, Mama,
but I'm glad to be home.

Chet, you didn't tell me
your brother was coming home.

Oh, it's news to me.

Maybe I can get that
vacation time after all.

Totally!

I can so cover for you.

I bet my brother's been
working you like a horse.

He has. He really has.

Uh huh, I bet.

So great to see you.

<i>Yeah and it Wasn't
until the house cleared out</i>

<i>that I noticed
the fucking TV was gone, man.</i>

<i>Thai party got massive.</i>

<i>I</i> couldn't keep
an eye on everything.

<i>But you know Sam, of course,</i>

<i>fucking shit bricks
when he got home.</i>

<i>I don't think I will be
houses/ï¬‚ing for Sam ever again.</i>

Oh, man.

Will you look at this.

It is good to be home.

Ew, you kept this'?

God, I still have nightmares

of being woken up
at 5AM by this thing.

[honks duck call]

I haven't had time to change
much since the funeral.

Just trying to organize
the store and...

Yeah, I don't do funerals.
OK.

Dude, this calendar is intense.

Yeah, well, nothing gets done
unless I write it up there so...

Ok and that...

that is creepy.

You gonna keep it'?

No, I don't know. I just...

I don't know
what to do with it yet.

How about that creek outback'?

You know he loved it up there.

Yeah... maybe.

Here.

We'll give you some time.

You gotta do it now.

It's on your calendar.

I have to do it'?

Oh yeah, I'll be long gone
by then, brother.

What?

I'm just asking.
This all seems kind of sudden.

Dude, there's no plan.

Why's there gotta be a plan'?

I wanted to spend some
time with my big brother.

That's my plan.

Well, what happened
to the money

I sent you two months ago'?

You know what, forget I asked.

I'll figure something out.

We should get
some apples tomorrow,

test out your juicer.

I've never actually
used one before.

You know what, I gave it
to the ex-boyfriends.

The juicer'?
Yep.

I don't have any storage, man.

Remember'?

I'm living out of my truck.

Besides, those two can
remember me when they're

juicing their bananas.

So you eat in here
all the time on your own'?

Yeah, it's comfortable.

Dad loved this place.

Always bragging
about his log cabin.

You're welcome to stay.
It's your house too.

I'm just...

the store's been slow.
I'm tight on money.

I can help out.

I did promos for the bar
for like a year, remember'?

Oh God.
No.

We get some gogo boys.

A beer bust!

Think about it.

We keep the whole
hardware store theme, right'?

Come on.

Construction zone.

Hard Hat Hotties.

Peligro, Peligro!

Sit down.

So funny you kept the bunk bed.

It's a loft

and I like it over me.
It's cozy.

That's so creepy awesome.

What are you doing'?
This is my room.

You're in Dad's room.
I'm not sleeping in there.

I'm making the bed for you.

You sleep in there.
I'm not sleeping in there.

It's nice to be home
with you, brother.

[alarm buzzing]

Todd!

You're supposed to help out
at the store this morning,

remember'?!

I gave Ann the day off.

I need someone at the register.

Tomorrow.

<i>I need rest.</i>

Come on, you said
you would help today.

<i>Get out or you're gonna
see some morning</i> Wood.

Hold on, Justin. I'm coming.

I got it. I got it.

Sorry. Thank you.

No problem. I'm here.

Kind of figured
this would happen.

I just think he needs
time alone right now.

Sure you don't want any'?

Yeah, I filled up
on junk all day.

It'll be in the fridge
if you get hungry.

Wanna talk'?

God, I don't even fucking
care about the relationship!

It was always
all about them anyhow.

I was fucking
the third wheel, literally.

Well, not literally.
You weren't actually a wheel.

What?

Sorry, just...

I'm just so fucking tired
of failing at everything, man.

LA fucking sucks!
You got distracted.

You need to get focused again.

God, lam so over being focused!

All I wanna do
is move to an island alone,

raise some chickens and,

I don't know, fuck the sheep.

OK, well...

Isn't that what you do,
up here alone'?

You fuck the sheep'?

You think I'm fucked up,
don't you'?

No.

I'm going to bed.

<i>(Chet) To be happy.</i>

<i>Find joy-</i>

<i>I could never think about that.</i>

<i>What did you want for me'?</i>


Yep. I'm coming.

Yeah, that's fucking hot.
You like that'?

Oh, shit!
Oh, God, whoa.

Why are you doing
that down here'?!

The lighting is better!

No, no, no, no, no.

You can't leave the kitchen...
Jesus Christ!

Unfucking believable!

You just picked right up
where you left off, didn't you'?

What do you want'?!

The kitchen is a mess.
So'?

So, I'm not gonna
be your babysitter again.

Where are you going'?

Put some clothes on!
My underwear is out here!

Hey man.

What's up?

No, that's not the right...

Here, just wipe the counters.

Why don't you come to
the store with me tomorrow'?

It'll take your
mind off things.

There's a cute UPS guy
who comes around noon.

Really?

How cute'?

I don't know. Cute.

Fine.

But I get
to receive his package.

You're gonna miss
the school bus!

Coming, mother!

[cell phone vibrating]

You can't smoke in my truck.

You really think that's

an appropriate outfit
for school, son'?

It is if you wanna
get fucked in shop class,

Mom.

Alright, $9.18.

Todd!

Coming, boss.

He wears the pants, not me.

I'm flying free, man.

Vuelo libre!

So you wanna make sure
your pipe is properly lubed.

A good jelly
should work for that.

Something nice and thick.

You really have
to grease the opening.

I'm telling you.

He will fix the roof if you
help him drain the gutter.

Oh my God, you are so bad.

All right, the small is going
to fit you perfectly.

I'm thinking the hard hat,
the tool belt and yeah...

nothing else.

Uh huh, yeah, see'?

You got it.

Well, we did do good today.
I will give you that.

Just gotta know how
to talk to your customers.

You have fun'?

Yeah.

It was good to get out.

This place looks good.

A lot better than that
shithole Dad used to run.

Really?

Just needed a woman's touch.

Do you remember
Brandon Tillman'?

What, that closet case
from your soccer team'?

You think that he's...

Gay'?

You can say the word, right'?
Never mind.

Brandon Tillman.

Didn't you guys
like mess around

at your prom or something'?

How did you know that'?
Because you told me.

Remember'?

You were wasted.

That was the one time I held
your head over the bowl.

Well, he's back in town.

He wants to get
a drink sometime.

Gay.
No, I don't know.

Gay.
No,

all I know is that
he lives in New York

and he's just here for-

<i>[sing/song voice] Gay gay
gay gay gay gay gay gay...</i>

What's up, boys!

Hey Kingston.

What's going on...

Holy shit, little Todd Waters!

What's up, King'?
Long time no see.

What's up, city boy'?
How's LA treating you'?

LA can go fuck itself.
Yes!

Nice!

Well, welcome home, dude.

There's my gays!
Hey, Rachel.

Hey, Tucker.

You're getting so big.
Yeah, he's not the only one.

And look at you!
Nice ink, bad ass!

Still got your
vag pierced, Rach'?

<i>Hey, whoa, â€œme out.
How does he know about that'?</i>

Who do you think went
with her in high school'?

I don't know if I'm OK with you

knowing all about
my wife's lady parts.

Well, I'm sure
it looked a lot better

before it got
blown out by them kids.

Ouch!

Well, lam glad you got
Chet out of the house.

We haven't seen him
at a party in awhile.

Hey look, it's the
hardware store dude!

What's up, man'?

How do you guys live around
so many straight people'?

I'm fucking serious.
This shit is intense.

<i>[chanting]
Drink, drink, drink...</i>

Just like old times, huh'?

Apparently.

So, he's pretty much
homeless at this point'?

And jobless.

Don't forget jobless.


Thank you, thank you.

I have had some experience

taking large objects
down my throat.

Anybody care for a demo'?

No, I'm serious.

They're out here every weekend.

You can't even
walk down the street

without tripping over
one of these yahoos.

I think they oughta tag them.

If you're from LA,

you have to turn in your
cellphone and wear a tag,

so we all know
who the hell you are.

Great idea, Hank.

Tag them like
the Nazis did the Jews.

And the gays.

I'm sick of them
coming up here,

taking over our campgrounds,
jamming up our roads.

I moved back to get away
from that bullshit.

Hank, you moved
back here because of that

sexual harassment lawsuit
at your last job.

That was a rumor!

Todd Waters'?!

Shit.

Oh my God,
what are you doing here'?

Oh, you know...

staying out of trouble.

Oh my God, we haven't
hung out in like forever.

11th grade. March.
We should probably be going.

I heard you were in LA.

I love LA.

Quick, Hank, get a tag on him!

Look at all these.

You're so rock and roll.

Girl, you should
see me in my leather.

Wait a minute, what'?

What'd you say, man'?

Nothing. Forget about it.

You being a smartass'?

Yeah, Hank.
I'm being a smartass.

Todd.
What?

What's your problem, man'?

What's my problem'?

Well, let's see if I can
remember this correctly.

I told little Miss Melissa here
a secret a long time ago.

Ok, let's just go -

and then she proceeded
to tell her boyfriend

and half the high school...
I didn't...

and then her boyfriend
and his douchebag buddies

proceeded to beat
the shit out of me

and gave me this and this
so I would never forget.

I didn't know they
were going to do that!

Of course you didn't, sweetie,
because you're an idiot.

Oh you're going down, LA!
Whoa, whoa!

Hank, let's go for a walk.

Thanks Rachel.
Sorry for everything.

Don't fucking apologize for me.
I didn't do anything.

Just go, watch him.

And be careful.

No, just remember
where you are.

I'm not asking you
not to be yourself,

God forbid.

Well, myself tells skanks and
rednecks what I fucking think.

Oh! A little warning,
that is all I ask!

I'm probably gonna
beat off in here,

so there's your
heads up on that!

<i>No no, if he thinks
Pm gonna stay home.</i>

<i>While he's off hunting all day.
Don't touch anything.</i>

Hi! I need screws
for hanging shelves.

OK, drywall'?

That's what I told him.
No, just regular walls.

You got it.

They're driving me crazy.
The minute he leaves,

they turn into these
raging little monsters.

So you gotta get
the stud finder.

Unfortunately, that's not
what it sounds like-

Richard, enough with the doll.

This is your sister's toy.

Dolls are not for boys.

Whatever you suggest is fine.

Let me call you back.

They're being total brats.

OK, all right, bye.

How much'?

Let's figure it out.

Richard, what did I just say'?!

Where's your boy toy'?


What are you doing'?!

It's a fucking doll.

You know, maybe he's gay.

You ever think about that'?

What did you just say'?
Is everything OK'?

Gay. When boys like boys.

It happens sometimes.

Like red hair.

Freaky but kinda cool.

Give me your hand.

You're gonna make
him feel like shit

about this now, aren't you'?

So he has to deal with that
for the rest of his life'?

You're crazy!

Come on.

I am never
coming in here again!

God, lady,
just give him the doll!

He'll have plenty of time
to play with the boy toy

when he's older!

Yeah, so this homeless guy
is seriously yelling at us

to help him
down these sandy stairs.

Central Park.
Middle of the day.

In the wheelchair'?

Yeah, down the stairs.

And he just goes for it and
we're trying to hold the chair

but it, you know,
has wheels on it so...

Well, I don't know
exactly how it happened,

but he fell and...
Yikes.

Terrifying.

And we're trying to help him up

but he doesn't
want us to touch him,

which is fine because
he smells like a landfill,

but he's bleeding from
the head and we're thinking,

"Oh my God, what did we do?!"

And we call the police

but he's already
hobbling into the chair

and wheeling himself away.

And he just...

well, he just leaves.

That was it'?

Yeah, never saw him again.

Could be dead, you know'?

We tried to get
him to stay but...

Wow.

Yeah. That's New York for you.

No, but you'd love it.

I don't know why
I told you that story.

I don't know why you
told me that story either.

So, wait, you've
lived here all your life'?

I went to college in Sacramento

for a couple of years

but... Dad really
needed my help so...

So you really like it here'?

Yeah...

I don't know.

It is what it is.

You still drinking wine coolers
down random dirt roads

in the middle of the night'?

I haven't done
that in awhile, no.

Look...

I don't want to be coy

and pretend like I don't
remember what happened.

I know that
you and I didn't really

speak much
after that night but...

it was just really tough
for me to come out.

OK.

It was hard for me too so...

This was fun.

Yeah.

If you ever want
to hang out again sometime...

Definitely, I'm just, you know,
with the store and Todd home...

Todd?

Your brother'?

Yeah, there's this
mass pilgrimage

back to the homeland,
apparently.

Why didn't you say anything'?

So, how is he'?

Still Todd.

Now, he's gay too, right'?

Funny.

OK well...

the offer is out there.

You don't have to hang out
with me, you know,

if you don't want to.

What?
Nothing.

Just... I don't want you
to feel obligated or whatever.

Um, OK.

OK.

[car locks beep]

<i>(Chet)
Did you want anyone for me'?</i>

Todd?

<i>Did you want me to know love'?</i>

If your father were alive
and he knew about this...

I could charge him
for indecent exposure,

lewd display, not to mention

the sodomy laws
we still have on the books.

Well, technically
he wasn't engaged in...

but I just gave him
a trespassing warning,

on your account.

John, I appreciate it, really.

He's just been
through a lot recently.

Better me than you,
right, brother'?

Let's go.

You just never catch
Chet down there, John.

Oh and tell
the Missus I said hello

and if she wants to do
Whip-its for old times sake,

I'm down.

Jesus, don't these guys
have anything better to do'?!

This is serious, Todd.

Your behavior reflects on me.

Please, no one's gonna
stop buying nails

because I got
caught in the woods.

They might.

Well, you don't need
their business anyway.

I need EVERYBODY'S business.

It was nothing, all right.

If it were a straight couple,
Officer Fucking John

would have probably
watched from the woods

and beat off or something.

Why do you think he patrols
that spot in the first place'?

[bamboo wind chimes]

Give me the magazine.

I threw it away.

I don't wanna hear another
Goddamn peep out of this room.

Let's do something fun.

Talked to Brandon lately.
Nope.

I thought you were going to...
Come on,

do you want to go or not'?
No, I'm pumped.

I just don't know
why you won't call him.

Maybe he'd wanna go.

No, this is about
you and I getting away.

OK.

So, do you not think he's gay'?

I don't think everyone
is gay like you do, no.

Does he know that you're gay'?
I don't know.

We didn't talk about it
at the market.

What?

Dude, you're a grown man.

Grow a pair
and ask the fucker out.

Do you think we should
bring the fly rods

or just stick with
the rod and reels'?

You were always like this.

Like what'?
Like this.

Your first fling in college got
so tired of waiting on you,

he slept with me.

Oh, is that how that happened'?

I wasn't pursuing him.

Oh, that was so sweet of you,
just helping out a poor,

neglected, blue-balled.
Oh come on!

You are not still
pissed about that.

I liked him.

Pencil dick'?

Oh God, I'm sorry I fucked
pencil dick before you could.

Get over it.

[folk music playing]

What? Why are we stopping'?

Same rock,
same trees, let's go.

[folk music playing]

It's good shit.
Um hmm.

Makes me horny.

What?

Everything is sex
with you, isn't it'?

Everything is sex, period.
With everybody.

Whenever I tell people
I've got a gay brother,

you know what
they ask, don't you'?

They do not.

Why'?

Why do people think that'?

Because everything is sex.

Now get over here
and let's fuck.

Come on.

Let's make some
retarded babies!

You're an idiot!
I want a baby, Chet.


Fucking idiot!


So, what, you don't want
a relationship ever again?

Nope. I am done.

I'm not shitting you, man.

They never last.

And that's good
cause the longer they last,

the harder the breakup.

Better to get out early
and keep your fucking sanity.

Nice.

You're in no place
to judge me, brother.

I'm not judging.
How's Ted'?

That's his name, right'?

Did you ever stop
obsessing over him'?

Or did his wife
finally catch you'?

You don't have
to be an asshole.

We weren't meant
to be loved, big brother.

We didn't get
that gene, remember'?

We.

Are.

Screwed.

Do you ever
even think about Dad'?

Of course I do.

He really respected you,
you know.

Respect, right.

I could just fit in better.

Fuck yeah.

You had the
pretend girlfriends,

were on the soccer team.

Then there was me,

the drama nerd getting high
in the prop closet.

When did you know'?

When you first got stubble.

Come on.

For real.
I'm not being a creeper.

I idolized you.

I knew you were different
from the other guys.

Except for Connor Cook.

Remember Connor Cook.
Yes!

Come on, the dude tied a sweater
around his neck for gym class.

Poor Connor Cook.

Yeah, well,
he's probably in New York now

making a shit ton of money

off of fashion
design or something.

Probably.

You know,
you should think about

coming down to LA
sometime, Chet.

We have hiking
there too, you know.

Yeah.

Be weird to be there
with you living here though.

What?

Shut the fuck up.

Never said I wasn't going back.

How's the acting going'?

Gone.
Gave it up like a year ago.

What'? Why'?

I still remember you
in that play your senior year.

"The Skin of Our Teeth".
Yes!

You were good.

I mean, you blew me away.

I was fucking good, wasn't I'?

Later, Mother Nature!

You dirty whore!

All right all right, I got one.

Ronald McDonald,

Jabba the Hut
or Edward Scissorhands.

These are my options'?

Come on, come on.

Marry'? Best friend'? Or fuck'?

These are the worst.
How am I going to answer this'?

Well, let's start
with the obvious.

I think Ronald McDonald
for a fuck.

He's got a... I'm sure of it.

The shoes.

[dance music playing]

â™ª

I saw Brandon.

What'?! When'?

The other night.
When you were having orgies.

Why didn't you tell me'?

I don't know.

I just wanted it
to myself for awhile.

And?

He's gay.

Holy shit. You dog.

We just talked and had drinks.

I fucking told you.

Have him over. Second date.

Uh uh.

Let me do this at my own pace.

Shit, child,
we'll be dead at your pace.

Are you ashamed
of me or something'?

I'm moving into Dad's room.

You can have my bed
if you want.

Good night.

All right, that is 10.

You're gonna need
roofing nails and tar.

I've got nails.

I'll take the tar.

The grand kids are gonna
love this playhouse.

They'll be my age
before I finish.

Todd behaving himself'?

Yeah. He's trying.

Don't let him rub off on you.

You get yourself
married and settled.

You'll be fine.

Tell you what, you spot
any eligible bachelors,

send them my way.

What do I owe you'?

I can put it on your tab.

I'll pay for it now.

OK.

Fuck!

(Todd singing) 1, 2, 3, 4,
I'm a big old country whore.

5, 6, 7, 8,
I know they appreciate.

Hey!

What are you doing tonight'?

Two years ago,
she Facebooked me

because she was in New York.

Like I was going
to show her around...

She gave me a blowjob
in high school.

Right, right.

Where'd you learn
to cook like this'?

Costa Rica, baby.

Todd was there for like
three months after college.

It's good.

A beach, a boat, three shifts
a week at the Cabana Bar

and ten inches of the
finest Costa Rican cock.

Paradise, man.

So, wait, you didn't go'?

No, that's when
the Home Depot moved in.

Dad was a wreck.

And he was convinced that Todd

was either a prostitute
or a drug mule.

What can I say, guys'?

The man knew my talents.

Did you guys ever
hear from your Mom

after your Dad passed away'?

I'm sorry. Should I have not-

I'm drinking,
I say stupid stuff-

We've never heard
from our Mom period.

Todd was too young
to remember her.

I barely remember...
I remember her.

You were only like...
I remember my mother, Chet.

In this kitchen.
Smoking a cigarette.

OK.

OK, well, that was a
Debby Downer conversation.

Who wants to smoke a joint'?

So our dad used
to play this song for us

when we were little.

And he used to joke around that

the song was written
about this house.

I remember Chet and I used
to think we were so cool

because we had a song
written about our house.

So without further ado, boys.

Here we go.

they have grown up

that led us round the hill.

The fences have
all gone to decay.

Come on, sing along, brother.

â™ª And the creek,
it has dried up â™ª

â™ª Where we used to go to mill â™ª

â™ª The time has changed
its course in other ways â™ª

â™ª Oh, the chimney's
falling down â™ª

I And the roof is tumbled in â™ª

â™ª Letting in the sunshine
and the rain â™ª

â™ª But the angels watch over
as I lay down to sleep â™ª

â™ª In that little,
old log cabin in the lane â™ª

Oh, shit, yeah.

This is awesome.

What are we doing again'?

Just stay close to the window.

Don't be stupid, Todd.

What is he doing'?

Who knows.


He'd get so pissed at us
for doing this, remember'?

OK, OK, I gotta go in.
I gotta pee.

We just got here.
I know, I know.

Just go off the side.
What are you doing'?

That's disgusting!

Be careful.


He can really handle
his liquor, that one.

Aren't you cold'?

Idiot. Here.

Oh shit.

You meant to do that.

No I didn't.

You did too.
I didn't.

You so meant to do that,
you little fucker.

[toilet flushes]

Clean this shit up.

Off with the shirt.

What are you doing'?

Come on. Fair is fair.

No.
I'll throw you off this roof.

Oh, shit.

Are you OK'?

I'm sorry, are you OK'?

So what'd you think,

you were gonna
have brothers tonight'?

What are you doing'?

Fuck.
Chet!

Shit.

I got this.

Hey.

I was just messing
around with him.

You know'? Testing him a bit.

Making sure he wasn't
playing us both.

What is wrong with you'?

I'm fucking high as a kite.

Why do you do this'?

Do you know how many times
I've stuck up for you'?

For what'?

For you to try to fuck
the one guy I've cared about-

I was trying to help.
Trying to help'?!

What are you-
how are you trying to help'?

You're crazy, Todd.

What is wrong with you'?

How is it trying to help, Todd'?
How'?!

When have you
ever tried to help'?

What is that supposed to mean'?
What are you talking-

Do you have any clue what I've
been through this past year'?

Any clue'?
No, I wasn't here.

What was I supposed to...
I fed him. I bathed him.

I sat up there
and I watched him die.

And you didn't even
come to the funeral.

I do everything, everything,

so you can prance around
like a little fucking faggot!

Fuck you!

You sound just like him.

You're not driving.
Go to hell.

Give me the keys.

I'm not cleaning up
another mess.

You're not Dad, asshole.
Give me the fucking keys.

You're gonna kill yourself!
Oh fuck!

I don't know what he told you
but he came onto me-

It doesn't matter, OK.
This is what happens.

I don't know what
I expected but...

you don't have to pretend
like you're into me, OK...

I'm not pretending-

I'm not my brother.
I don't want your brother.

I'm just a weak,
scared little person

who has never done anything

and never gone anywhere

so I'm not gonna be able
to compete with that.

Chet, I don't care, OK.

I'm not looking for that.

What are you looking for'?

I don't know.

I thought we were
having a good time.

Well, I don't think there's
anything here for you.

I don't... I can't be...

Chet, I don't need
you to be anything.

Please just go. OK'?

Please.

[bamboo wind chimes]

What do you want'? Hm'?

[phone ringing]

Todd. What's going on'?

They took
the fucking 4-wheeler.

Who did?
What happened to your face'?

Those assholes and you guys

won't do a goddamn
thing about it!

Todd.

This town fucking sucks!

Apparently some guys were
calling him names at the bar.

Todd was taunting them.

Linda said he was egging
them on, being vulgar.

He's trouble, Chet,

and you're not gonna
have a leg to stand on

if you press charges.

OK but, he said
they took our 4 wheeler.

I don't know what
happened to the 4 wheeler.

That's what he said

but clearly he was
on several substances.

Well, I mean,
he's pretty beat up, John.

Well, what do you expect'?

He's running around
town like a little faggot.

I didn't mean that.

You know what I mean.

He's not like you.
He's just, he's always...

Shoving it in your faces'?
Yeah. Exactly.

That's what Dad used to say.
Yeah, well, he's got a point.

This isn't LA.

You gotta have some respect

for the way
things go around here.

Now I'm sorry
if I've offended you or him,

but if he keeps acting
like a piece of shit

that's how people
are gonna treat him.

The sooner you realize that
and he realizes that,

the better...

Hey.

Chocolate chip pancakes.

Still working on the eggs.

There you go.

This is fine.

OK. Good.

You can't stay here anymore.

Man, I fucked up.

I'm sorry. I do that.

Brandon wasn't even
interested in me.

I need to be able
to do things my way now.

You always do things your way.
What is that supposed to mean'?

No, no. You come here.
You take over.

And I can't...

This isn't about me.

Excuse me'?

Yeah, this shit you're
going through with Dad

and your life and, yeah, no,
you can't put that on me.

Where am I supposed to go'?
I don't know.

I don't have a job.
I don't have any money.

You've had weeks
to make a plan.

Fuck that, man,
this is my house too!

You hate it here.

Why are you trying
to make this work'?!

Because I have
nowhere left to go!

No.

You're gonna leave anyway.
You always do, so, just...

Fine.

[background television]

I'll bring the eggnog again.

And a couple of cakes.

One for Kingston,
one for everyone else.

Is he still in town'?

Haven't heard anything.

You did the right thing.

I don't think I'm gonna be able
to host Christmas this year.

Chet.
I gotta go.

I'm sorry.

What are you going'?
I'm fine.

Come on.
I'm fine.

[shop bell jingles]

I'm not here to work.
Just dropping off a meatloaf.

You don't have
to take care of me.

Shh.

This is what I do
on my day off.

I cook.

It's not the first time
he's disappeared.

He'll show up.

<i>Howdy.</i>
<i>Hey there.</i>

Closed already'?

No no, not yet.

Hey Don.
Hey.

Gotta get some paint.

All done but the paint.

Haven't seen you for awhile.

Orange.

They want orange. Like a tiger.

You run a good store, son.

Your father would be proud.

Tiger orange.

Wooo. She'd kill me.

That would be the
loudest thing on the block.

That's OK, right'?

Yeah.

Yeah, that's OK.

I want my 4-wheeler back!

I wanna press charges!

Everything.

Assault. Theft.

You can shove THAT
in their faces!

You're not pussing out now,
are you'?

Where were you'?

Like you give a shit.

I was worried. I had no idea-

You kicked me out!

You didn't have
to leave like that.

Fuck you.

What do you want'? Huh?

What do you want from me'?

I don't want anything.

Why are you here'?

It's Dad Day.

We wrote it on the calendar.
No. No.

You don't get to be here now.
He was my dad too.

No. You weren't here.

You were never here.

He was my dad too.

No.

You don't get to be here now.

You don't get to just
come in whenever you want

and get whatever you want.

So, what, I have to suffer'?
Like you did'?

We've all got
to sacrifice like Chet.

Well, what exactly
did you sacrifice, huh'?

You got to go off and do
whatever you wanted-

You got Dad, asshole!

You got Dad.

Or maybe not.

Is that why you
hate me so much'?

You spent all that
time with him

and what do you
have to show for it'?

Did you even tell him'?

Did you even tell him
who you were Chet'?

Here we go.

Nope.

You never did.

You never had the balls.

I didn't have to tell him.

He knew.

That's not the same thing,
brother,

and you know it.

You know it now
when it's too late.

Well, good job, man.
You did it.

You spared him all that shame
and all that disappointment.

He couldn't have handled that.

Not again.

You should be proud.

Someone should give you a medal
for all your sacrifice-

At least I didn't run away.

Shit, I wasn't gonna
stick around here

and be your scapegoat anymore.

No, you can't put that on me.

You can't blame me
for you and Dad-

Dad hated me
because I was gay and...

No! Not because
you were gay, Todd.

Because you were gone! Gone!

Just like Mom!

He didn't hate you.
He just didn't know you.

You have no idea how bad
I wanted your life.

Since the day you were born,
you were just you,

and I couldn't even...

I wanted to tell him...

but I didn't want to lose him.

I couldn't.

I'm sorry.

I couldn't.

I couldn't.

[folk music playing]

Is that for me'?

Are you going to eat
that all by yourself'?

[indistinct conversations]

Merry Christmas.

Hey.

I can't stay long.

No.

Hi.

How's it going over there'?

First Christmas
without her, so, you know'?

Yeah... yeah, I do.

It sounds festive in there.

Yeah. It's better.

I'm sorry.

I know that I've been
juvenile and stupid and...

Look, that's what
families do, OK'?

They bring out
the juvie in all of us.

Sta)'-

I can't.

They're waiting for me to...
Come back.

Later tonight.

â™ª Oh Christmas tree â™ª

â™ª Oh Christmas tree â™ª

Everybody!

â™ª Oh Christmas tree â™ª

â™ª Oh Christmas tree â™ª

Hey, Chet! We need a soprano!

[music, singing continues]

Hey.

I can't believe you kept this.

I kept them all.

I made it
in Miss Dudich's class.

Remember her'?
Oh yeah.

God, I loved her.

Did you guys have
the cookie election'?

When you had
to go under the table

and cast your ballot
for the best cookie'? Yes.

We watched Bambi in her class.

I bawled when the mom...

so stupid...

but she just pulled me aside

and rocked me in her arms
until I stopped.

I didn't know that happened.

I wanted her
to be our mom so bad.

I tried to fix her up with Dad.

I remember that.

So this is what it's always
like around here, huh'?

Yeah.

I got a call from Lucas,
that guy I met in Greece.

He's in Portland backpacking.

Wants me to go.

Is that good'?

Maybe.

Brandon invited me to New York.

No shit.

You're going, right?

I mean...

I think.

Yes. Chet.

You're going.

You're so going.

See, we're not
that screwed, right'?

I'm gonna...

[indistinct conversations]

[bamboo wind chimes]

Motherfucker.

Left it in there
for two seconds.

It's OK. It's supposed
to look like that.

Todd!

Get down here.
I'm not yelling again!

[smoke alarm beeping]
I'll get it!

Here you go.

There you go.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas!


Eat your turkey.

I don't like turkey.

Yeah you do.
Everybody likes turkey.

Look at your brother.
He loves it.

Mmmmmm.

Yum yum yum yum.

Stop it!

Hey.

Hey, that's enough.

Cut it out!

You two, you be nice.

Listen to me.

You two are brothers, OK,
and brothers don't fight.

You know what brothers do'?

Brothers look out
for each other.

Brothers take care
of each other.

Look at him.

And you, look at him.

You look like each other.

See?

That means you
have a bond, OK'?

So if you hurt each other,
you know what that means'?

You're just
hurting yourselves, OK'?

That's your brother.

Stick together.

Eat your dinner. Both of you.

You gonna do it'?

<i>(Chet) I Wanna fly now</i> too.
