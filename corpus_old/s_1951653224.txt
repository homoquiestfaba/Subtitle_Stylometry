Grace?

Grace, do you know
who this man is?

That´s the real John Ryder:

He´s been missing
since Tuesday:

Then who:::

We don´t know yet:

Now, we´ve run
his fingerprints
and mug shots

through every database
we´ve got,

and we´ve come up
with nothing:

This guy´s a ghost:

So, I need your heIp
here, Grace:

Is there anything
he toId you about himseIf?

No:

Anything at aII?

No:

Open cell F!

Ryder, l need you to stand up
and put your hands
behind your back:

l need you to stand up,
put your hands
behind your back:

(CLEARS THROAT)

So, where are you from?

All over:

ls that so?

You´re a sick fuck,
aren´t ya?

The way you tortured
that young man:

l know
you enjoyed yourself:

l just can´t figure out
why you did it:

You knew
you´d get caught:

Why´d you do it?

Why not?

How many others
have you killed?

Hard to say:

You see,
here in the great state
of New Mexico,

we do have
the death penalty:

You don´t seem
too worried:

Should l be?

You comfy down there, John?

Are those cuffs
a little tight?

Yeah, a little tight:

Yeah, you see,
those are the new ones:

They stretch out after
you wear them for a while:
Let me see:

(EXCLAlMS lN PAlN)

Look at me:

You have yourself
a nice trip:

We´ll chat again real soon:

Maybe next time,
you´ll be better company:

Thanks:

Where are we going?

l´m taking you to Albuquerque
for trauma support:

l can release you
to your parents there:

OFFlCER: Step up:

03 X-ray,
we´re about 20 minutes out:

DISPATCHER:
Copy that, 03 X-ray:

OFFlCER: l get home,
l look at my paycheck:

lt´s so skinny:

l decide to take
another job:

So now
l´m delivering pizza:

What are you
getting your daughter
for her birthday?

She´s just turned five:

She wants to take me:::
Go to the mall,

get one of those big
customized teddy bears:

A customized teddy bear?
Come on:

Yeah:

lt´s just another way
they can charge:::

ESTERlDGE: Look, Grace:::

l wish l could have
stopped this

before it got
all out of control:

l know there´s
nothing that l can say
that´ll bring Jim back,

but l am sorry:

l truly am:

Get your own little pants,
your own little jacket:

Make your own
little teddy bear:

For real, you spent
100 bucks on a teddy bear?

Yeah, l know:
lt was hurting me:

Yeah, it´s 100 bucks:::

You know,
this week´s check,
it´s gone:

Stop moving:

What the fuck?

lt´s cool:::

Oh, shit!

Son of a bitch!


My leg´s stuck:

03 X-ray:

l need a Code 3 backup
on Highway 19:

DISPATCHER: 10-4, 03 X-ray:

Grace, l want you
to run up over that hill
and wait there for help:

l´m done running:

Grace! Grace!

That´s not the answer:

You don´t know
what you´re doing:

Yes, l do:

Grace!

ESTERlDGE: Grace, be careful!


Backup, now!
Let´s go!

03 X-ray: Where the hell
is my goddamn backup?

You better hurry:

(BANGlNG ON DOOR)


Grace!

Go fuck yourself!

No!

(RlFLE COCKlNG)

Feels good, doesn´t it?

l don´t feel a thing:
