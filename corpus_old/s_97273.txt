Containment breach!
We've had a major containment breach!

Oh, my God.

The security system
appears to be malfunctioning!

Seal the base, Campion!
lf the main gate's still open, shut it!

Yes, sir.

People are dying like flies down here!

Use the manual gate override, Campion!

Do it now, do it now!

Sally. Baby Lavon.

Campion! This is a Code Red!

We've lost one of the bugs!

Repeat, we have lost one of the bugs!

You have to close the gate!

Sally!

Charlie?

-We gotta get out of here.
-What's going on?

You know what.
Get the baby stuff, let's go!

-Oh, my God!
-Come on! Let's go!

-l'm coming!
-Let's go! Come on!

Give me the baby!

All right, let's go.

Slow down, Charlie.

Charlie, slow down!

Charlie, you'll get us all killed!

Sorry, baby.

Blackout!

And now, here is the host ofBlackout,
Bob Goen.

Coming up next,
we got Kathi Kamen Goldmark...

America 's new country sweetheart.

Sure wish she was my sweetheart.

Why don't you listen to me, old man?

Been listening to you
more than 20 years now, ain't l?

All that wisdom and l ain't rich yet.

Yeah, well, if you learned
some simple economics.

Old man Vic thinks simple economics...

is some new breed of lrishman.

Ain't you ignorant!

Licking the glue off the back
of them food stamps...

has finally done something to your brain.

Well, l got to feed your daughter, don't l?

Shut off the pumps.

Look at him, Stu.

You don't think he did that to his face
falling out of the car, do you?

l doubt it.

Just take it easy now. Calm down.

Hap! Phone rescue services
in Braintree now.

Hurry up! Go on!

Just take it easy, friend.
lt's gonna be all right.

Just lie still now. lt's all right.

lt's gonna be all right.

Ambulance will be here in 10 minutes.

My wife and my baby are sick.
They need help.

Help my wife and my baby.
They're sick, they need help!

Okay, mister, they're fine.
You just want to sit right there.

The ambulance is on its way.

We didn't get out in time after all.

You just try to rest yourself, okay?
Just take it easy now.

Gate malfunctioned, otherwise
we would've died in the compound.

Project Blue.

Get his head over to the side, Stu.
He's gonna choke.

Get your head down.

Come on.

Like l told you!

l ain't got time to throw a line
over that dog's head!

You mind me now!

What's he got? You got any idea?

Maybe it's food poisoning.
He's got California plates here.

Maybe he got some bad chow
at a roadside stand or something.

l hope you're right.

l seen cholera back in '58
down near Nogales.

This is what it looks like.

Sally and the baby,
they were sick since Salt Lake City...

but l felt fine until this morning.

Are you sure Sally and my baby are okay?

There was a man with us
some of the time.

He was a dark man.

l was looking through
the rear-view mirror...

and l'd see him just sitting there
grinning at me.

l thought l could outrun him...

but you can't outrun the dark man.

Not now. Hilly, put this on the wall.

Come.

General Starkey, sir!

Close the door and drop the bull, Len.

Yes, sir.

lt killed them in a hurry down there.

Telemetry suggests even the ones
who got their respirators on...

died within 12 minutes.

The rest of them were gone in five.
You believe that?

-Do l have a choice?
-No.

Apparently none of us do.

lt's nothing but a souped-up version
of the flu.

Herbert Denninger
of the National Disease Control Center...

the Pentagon's bright boy of the week,
says once we find Campion...

we'll know if it's actually
going to jump to the outside.

He says it might mutate, but that won't
help the people that catch it.

-Listen, l have what might be something--
-lt'll just take them longer to die, that's all.

Most people are gonna think
they've got the plain old non-lethal flu...

right up to the very end.

And that's the biggest break
we've had so far.

All because a gate malfunctioned,
and some glorified TV repairman...

got his family and ran for the hills.

l'd like to get him and string him up by--

We found him. We located Campion.

He crash-landed at a gas station
on the outskirts...

of a one-stoplight town in east Texas.

He made it halfway across the country?

-How'd he do that?
-l don't know.

The important thing is, right now,
we've got a shot at containing this.

-ls he dead or alive?
-He's dead.

Denninger says this stuff
has a communicability level...

of over 99%.
Do you understand what that means?

Any chance we had of containing it
went by the boards...

when Campion bought
his first takeout hamburger.

We can't think that way, Billy.

Yeah, you're right. Of course you are.

-What about the rest of his family?
-They're dead, sir.

-Contact with townspeople was minimal.
-That doesn't matter.

We gotta shut that town down,
lock it up...

dig a moat around it.

That operation's already
on the launching pad, sir.

-What kind of coverage you come up with?
-Anthrax.

New strain.

Yeah, it's a new one, all right.
lt's real new.

lt's very good at its job, too. Too good.

-lt's bad, General, but it could be worse.
-How's that?

What's the name of this town?

Arnette.

Arnette, Texas.

Cold got you down?

Chills, fever?
Sounds like you need a buddy!

Flu Buddy!

Fast-acting Flu Buddy,
available at pharmacies everywhere.

Flu Buddy!

And now let's get back
to the Lone Star matinee movie.

State Patrol, Hap.
Looks like your cousin Joe-Bob.

Hey, Joe-Bob.
Want me to fill her up for you?

No, sir, l come by on other business.

Was that old geezer here last night
when that guy took out your pumps?

Vic? He's here just about every night.

-Maybe he ought to hear this, too.
-Hear what?

There's strangers
crawling all over Braintree.

Supposed to be U.S. Health Service guys...

but they came in a C-5A transport plane,
and they look like regular Army to me.

Then there's been
three more big transport planes...

land over Starland in Arkansas since noon.

lt was cholera. l knew it was.

l don't know nothing about that.

l'll tell you one thing, though.

lf the Feds are thinking about
a quarantine...

then you might have a little bit more
to worry about than cholera.

l just thought you ought to know
what's stirring in the weeds, Hap.

lf any of them other boys
from last night come by...

you ought to pass the word along to them.
Just don't mention my name.

You ought take care of that, old-timer.
Them summer colds are the worst.

What if it ain't a cold?

What if l got whatever he had?
That guy last night?

lt's probably just the sniffles, that's all.

Maybe l ought to close up the station
for the rest of the day.

Call the others
and see how they're feeling.

Might not be a bad idea.

Dang!

This is Unit 16 to base.

l'm seeing a lot of Army traffic
on State 17...

westbound in the direction of Arnette.

You heard anything about that? Bye.

Please advise if you've been
anywhere near Arnette today. Bye.

Negative, base.

l've been over
by the Arkansas state line all day.

Well, that's fine then.

Suggest you let the Army
mind their business...

and you mind yours, Unit 16. Bye.

You don't have to be so grouchy
about it, Cynthia !

Unit 16, over and out.

All right, let's move it out.

Come on, toss it!

Shoot it!

Hold it right there, now!

l can't leave my store.

Hey, what right have you got
to push me around?

Stuart Richard Redman, sir.

He was at the station.

Sounds like you're having a busy day.

Dr. Herbert Denninger, Mr. Redman.
Will you come with us?

You want to get your hand
off my arm, hoss?

He was in direct contact with Campion.

-Put him in the truck. lf he resists....
-l ain't gonna resist.

Country don't mean dumb.

l ain't going! l ain't!

Get your hands off her!

Stay where you are, Mr. Redman.
That's none of your affair.

Stu, what's happening?

They want to take us to Vermont!

Mr. Redman, l insist you get into the truck
right now, or....

Or what? You'll shoot me?

That don't scare me much, hoss.

lf we got what that guy Campion had,
we're dead already.

Right?

Well, our flying time today will be
three hours and forty minutes...

and Uncle Sam is buying all the drinks.

What the hell's wrong with us?

-ls it cholera?
-Absolutely not.

You'll be getting all the details....

When?

Shortly after you land.

l ain't been this scared
since the Mekong Delta in '69.

No, that ain't true.
l never been this scared.

lt's just the ones that was there
when Campion croaked, ain't it?

Us, our families,
the people we been around since.

Right now, yeah.

What do you mean, right now?

Okay, people, saddle up.

Let's go!
You're on Uncle Sam's time now. Move it.

Move them out!

Arnette's been cancelled.

-Serious?
-What do you think?

l don't know.

l think we're in big trouble.

And now, by request from Bay Ridge...

Larry Underwood
and Baby Can You Dig Your Man.

Well, baby, can you?

Ma !

You look beautiful.

Aren't you glad to see me?

Should l be, Larry?

Well, l can be happy for the both of us
if l have to be.

Come on inside, Larry,
before the neighbors get an eyeful.

So you know the record cracked
the top 50?

-You heard it, right?
-Of course l have. You sound black.

That brown sound sure do get around!

Right.

So l'm in L.A...

and all of a sudden, everyone's my friend.

And everyone's got a ''can't miss'' deal.

So l had to get out of there
for a little while.

Take a little time off.

How's your back, Ma?

Pains me some, but l got my pills.

What kind of trouble are you in, Larry?

Maybe l overspent my advance a little.

l didn't know the record company
was gonna be so cheap.

lt's no big deal...

except l borrowed a little money.

And not from any bank,
or you wouldn't be here, right?

Are the leg-breakers any different
on the West Coast than they are here?

Do they give you a Perrier and Valium
before they start hurting you?

You're just like your father.

-l'm not just like Pop!
-You sound pissed off.

-l am pissed off, Ma !
-Good.

lt's good to know that there's still
a real person in there someplace.

How deep a hole are you in? And don't lie.

l've seen your car.

About $40,000.

Jesus wept.

But the record's number 21 this week, Ma,
with a bullet.

The album hasn't hit the Hot 100 yet,
but it will.

$40,000 is nothing.

Nothing.

l'm not gonna let them make me
a one-hit wonder, either.

Your son's here to stick around.
l'm going to be famous, Ma.

Even better, l'm going to be rich.

The bed's still in your old room.

l'll make it up,
but then l have to go to work.

-l'm gonna be late as it is.
-All right. Thanks.

Thanks, Ma.

Welcome home, Larry.

This is interesting. Now watch this.

lt's so damn quick.

The only two left from the gas station
are Bruett and Redman, correct?

Yes. Bruett's critical and sinking fast...

which leaves only Redman,
who's not even sick.

Now how in God's name is that possible?

l don't know, but we're going to find out.

We have to find out. And soon.

We will.

ln other news...

U.S. Government health officials
claim there's nothing strange...

in their decision to quarantine
a small east Texas town...

where a new strain
of what's believed to be swine flu...

has got half the population in bed...

and the other half down with the sniffles.
At the Vermont Center....

Hello, Mr. Goldsmith!

-Hello, Harold!
-ls Fran around?

She's in the kitchen, l think.

-Hi, Fran.
-Hi, Harold.

-Thanks, Daddy.
-Don't mention it, sweetheart.

-l brought you something.
-You did?

ls that you?

Of course, Everleafis just
a small literary magazine.

Small but prestigious.
And they only pay in contributors' copies.

Look, Daddy, we know a published writer.

How about that!

My poem is called ''The Crushed Rose.''
l marked it for you.

l actually sent in three,
but, of course, their space is very limited.

Harold, l'm going to read this
just as soon as l get a chance. Thanks.

ln the meantime, congratulations.

Thank you.

l had another reason for stopping by,
as well.

l was wondering
if you would care to accompany me...

to the Redwood Cinema this Friday
in Boothbay.

They're having a Bergman festival.

l've always found Cries and Whispers
to be especially moving.

You see, Amy and l already decided to go
to an R.E.M. concert in Portland.

Sorry.

Well, maybe some other time.

l'm sure you'll find somebody to go with.

You know, maybe somebody
even your own age.

l mean.... l didn't mean that.

Hey, no, don't worry about it.
lt's okay. l understand, really.

-l hope you enjoy the poem...
-l will--

...and the rest of the magazine.

Why don't you stay
and have some iced tea or something?

No, thanks. l'm actually in sort of a hurry.

l really handled that great, didn't l?

Considering that Harold Lauder's had
a crush on you since he was 9 years old...

yeah, l think you did okay.

Let me see that.

''l have stridden the fuming way
Of sun-hammered tracks

''And savage hobo jungles''

Stop!

Frannie?

-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

l'm the object
of a young poet's unrequited love.

What else could a girl want?

You and Jess haven't had a fight?

l haven't seen much of him this summer.

Actually, Jess and l have decided
to spend some time apart.

lt's like that, is it?

Yeah, just like that.

Come here. Give your old man a hug.

-What about you? How are you doing?
-l'm fine.

l woke up this morning
missing your mother, so l came out here.

After seven years...

there's a lot of places in the house
where she ain't...

but this ain't one of them.

Sometimes when l'm out here
yanking weeds, l can almost see her.

l love you, Daddy.

l love you, too.

Although l've resigned myself
to losing you to Harold Lauder someday.

No!

You okay?

And how are you today, Mr. Redman?

We're just going to do a few routine tests.

-lf l could have your arm....
-No, l won't be doing any more tests.

lt's just your blood pressure.
Doctor's orders.

No, l want to talk to a doctor.
l want to talk to a doctor in person.

l'm sure that you'll be talking to a doctor
very soon.

Yeah, l'm sure l will, too. No more tests!

-l'm sick of it!
-Mr. Redman, if--

l think you'd better get in there, don't you?

Say, if it isn't the man with
the little clipboard and the armed escort.

No, we don't shake hands here.
Just a precaution.

A precaution.

Patty Greer says you've given her
quite a bit of trouble.

-She's quite upset.
-That makes two of us.

Being hijacked by some government
sons of bitches in space suits...

does that to me every time.

lf you don't want to see me
rip a hole in that...

before you can get out of here,
you better give me a little information.

-You tell me why l'm not sick.
-Mr. Redman, l hardly think....

-Talk to me, damn it!
-l'm sorry, but you....

Mr. Redman, be reasonable.

Just get out of here, you little weasel.

You send me someone
who'll give me some answers.

l don't think
you quite appreciate your position.

You're wrong about that.

l do.

Go on. Get out.

Here he comes.

-We won't really hurt him, will we, Ray?
-Quiet down.

Get him !

What the hell are you waiting for?

Next time l yell, friend,
you're gonna pay attention.

l guarantee it.

Hold him ! Hold the sucker!

Hold him. l'm gonna mess him up.

How come he don't say nothing?

By the time l finish with him,
he'll be singing...

The Battle Hymn of the Republic.

Sucker almost ruined my favorite shirt.
l'm gonna mess him up.

-Stop it, Ray! You're killing him !
-Ray, car!

-No!
-Heads up, sucker!

l can hear!

l can talk!

l can hear.

l can talk.

l know, Nick. Praise God.

How did you know my name?

Come to me in a dream, l reckon.

ls this a dream?

Mayhap it is, and mayhap it ain't.

Who are you, ma'am?

Abagail Freemantle.

But folks around these parts
just call me Mother Abagail.

l'm 106 years old
and l still make my own bread.

l been living right here
in Hemingford Home, Nebraska, all my life.

You come see me, Nick.

You and all your friends.

You got to hurry, though.

There's a storm coming.

His storm.

Some people have even taken
to wearing protection on the streets.

-Why are you wearing this mask, sir?
-l don't know. Just feel safer.

Okay. Thank you.

The folks at the
Atlanta Disease Control Center told me...

that these masks wouldn't stop
'"a flu germ with a hangover. '"

-Gin.
-So l guess we can thank our lucky stars...

that this outbreak of superflu
is just another urban....

l don't know about all those people
down in Texas...

but you sure sound
like you got a dose of the flu, Johnny.

-You better let me take a listen.
-Forget that.

Come on.

You know how hot it makes me
when you take your shirt off.

When l was a boy, we caught ourselves
a mountain lion back up in the hills.

We shot it and dragged it back to town.

What was left of that critter
when we got home...

was the sorriest-looking sight
l've ever seen.

You're the second sorriest, boy.

l'm gonna get somebody to take
his shirt off before l go home tonight.

lt's okay, son. l'm a doctor.

l'm also the guy
who damn near ran you over.

You got a name, babalugah?

What the hell?

lt means that he's deaf and dumb.

That hurt?

lf you're deaf and dumb...

how the hell am l gonna to find out
what happened to you tonight?

Can you read lips, babalugah?

Thank God for small favors.

Tell me this...

would you know the three boys
that jobbed you if you seen them again?

What?

One of them had a ring like that?

Man!

That's a fraternity ring, my silent friend.

And the only two people around here
who have them...

are our esteemed sheriff and Ray Booth,
our town bad boy.

The Sheriff here married Ray's baby sister.

Janey's gonna just love this.

Welcome to Shoyo, Mr. Andros.

lt's a veritable hotbed
of Southern hospitality.

Get away from me.

l don't know how many different ways
l can say this.

This so-called superflu does not exist.

Then what is it?
Why is everybody talking about it?

l don't know
why everybody's talking about it...

or where the rumors are coming from.

lt must be a figment
of the press's imagination.

l don't know why l'm here
answering questions.

l don't have the answers
because there's no such thing....

Good afternoon, Mr. Redman.
My name is Deitz.

l'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

Meet Geraldo.

Geraldo?

Now, the virus
your fellow townspeople contracted...

passes easily from human to guinea pig
and vice versa, presumably.

But Geraldo has been breathing your air
via convector for the last three days...

and Geraldo is fine and frisky, as you see.

l'd call that rather comforting,
wouldn't you?

-l see you're not taking any chances.
-That's not in my contract.

However, it does appear...

that there's absolutely nothing
wrong with you, Mr. Redman...

or may l call you Stu?

Just don't call me Geraldo.

l like that.

Now look here, Stu...

let's try to get through this as painlessly
as possible, what do you say?

Okay, here's number one:

The testing schedule we began
earlier this week is going to resume...

with your cooperation or without it.

We got a hell of a mess on our hands here,
thanks to that imbecile Campion.

So l don't want you to get the idea
you're a volunteer.

You've been drafted.

-What about the folks l came in with?
-From Arnette?

All dead. Which is why we can't afford to--

What did you do? What did you people do?

Stu, please.

No! Stand clear!

All right, now you listen up...

l'm not responsible for you being here...

or for the dead people in your hometown.

Neither is Denninger, or the nurses
who come in to take your blood pressure.

-Then who is?
-No one. Everyone. God.

Who knows.

All you have to do is resign yourself
to a few more pokes and pricks.

What if l....

-Evacuate!
-Deitz, calm down.

l was just faking.

Why?

Why would you do a thing like that?

You talk about this thing in here
like you were outside of it.

l just wanted you to get a little taste
of what it's like on the inside.

How do you like it?

You stupid son of a bitch.

Get the hell out of here.

Don't forget your damn guinea pig.

Reports of the supposedly lethal
flu epidemic continue to spread.

Many downtown shopping areas
in southern Florida...

are virtually empty this morning...

and the flu rumor
actually seems to be gaining credence...

despite statements from health officials
in Atlanta and Vermont.

ln Vermont, Dr. Herbert Denninger said,
'"Let me put it in five simple words.

'"Captain Trips does not exist. '"

How's the sexiest bartender in L.A.?

Larry? ls that you?

Larry? ls that you?

Yeah, Arlene, listen.

Yeah, Arlene, listen.

Yeah, Arlene, listen.

You better get this first.
Wayne Stukey called.

He said your album's going up
nine spots this week...

your single's third on the Billboards
and you're number one on VH1 .

Sounds to me
like you might just be king of the world.

What's it sound like to you?

Victory!

Arlene, l love you!

Don't l wish.

Listen, l'm gonna try and get...

the afternoon flight back.

So you put on your sexiest number.
l'm gonna take you out to dinner.

Then l'll take you out dancing,
then maybe l'll just take you.

You might want to consider delaying
your trip back a few days.

Why? What's the problem?

Things are weird.

People are really scared about this
Captain Trips thing.

Yeah, radio here says it's just bull.

The radio here says the hospitals
are filling up with sick people...

and some of them are dying.

What, people are dying of the flu?

There's a lot of soldiers around.

Suddenly L.A. is a really creepy place
to be, Larry.

Maybe l'll stick around New York
a couple of days then.

Just don't forget
what you promised when you get back.

Dinner, dancing,
and all the paparazzi l can smile at.

Yeah, you got it.

-Bye.
-Bye.

-Sorry. l'm sorry, man.
-The Rat Man forgive you this time.

Bring out your dead!

He's coming for you, Larry!

The man with no face.

Bring out your dead!

Turn that up.

Give me that.

lt's a dead soldier.

Dead company.

-All-star bowling.
-Come on, Poke!

-You know what time it is?
-What time is it?

-Time to make a cash withdrawal!
-l heard that.

And if anybody,
l mean anybody, says anything...

or does anything to stop us....

-We're gonna Pokerize them.
-That's right. Damn straight.

-lf we're gonna do this, do it fast.
-l know what you mean, jellybean.

All right!

Hold still and won't nobody get hurt.

That's all, folks!

Look out, Poke!

You see it, Lloyd?
That old bugger tried to shoot me!

Hold it!

Hands up!

Deputy Sheriff Owen Kinsolving, officers.
Coming out.

Who's he? What's he doing there?

You got this coming out the door.

That's enough! That's enough, Owen!

Bull crap!

Pop Jones...

Betty Diamond, both dead.

lt ain't never gonna be enough.

We have a rather large problem
in Wyoming, sir.

What large problem is that, Len?

A news team got out of Pine Bluff with
some potentially damaging videotape, sir.

Flu victims? Body dumps?

A little of both. And our ops, l'm told.

-We can't have that.
-No, sir, l know.

Showing footage like that
would not be in the national interest.

Absolutely not, sir.

Do we know where these newspeople,
these rabble-rousers are now?

Yes, sir, we do.

Get that videotape, Len.
Any means necessary.

Make it a priority.

Yes, sir.

Any means necessary.

-Everybody out of the van!
-Mike, you getting all this?

-l don't like the way this looks. Be careful.
-Come on! Out right now! Let's go!

You'll have to surrender the camera
that gentleman's holding...

and any tape you may have already shot.

Can you tell us why, Major?

You don't seem to understand
the situation here.

Martial law has been declared.

We don't have to put up
with you and your pinko friends anymore!

Are you getting all this?

-Can we have a comment--
-Get him !

-Get the driver!
-Stop!

-ln the car!
-No!

Cut the power!

Come.

Thank you.

lt looks like our problem in Wyoming
has been solved.

lt doesn't change the basic fact
that our goose is pretty well cooked.

''Things fall apart
The center does not hold''

A man named Yeats said that.

l didn't understand that poem
in college, Len.

But l must be getting smarter
in my old age...

because l understand it now.

And one other line from that poem:

''What rough beast

''lts hour come round at last

''Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?''

l think that beast
might be on its way, Len.

What do you think?

ls that Hungarian goulash?

l don't know. lt might be, sir.

Yeats was right. Things fall apart.

Who died and made you God?

You don't think we're gonna eat that,
do you, dummy?

You could have poisoned it,
you blue-eyed pretty boy.

l'm gonna mess up your hair, pretty boy!
l'm gonna ride you like a lame bronc.

You're mine, sucker!

Sorry, guy. l can't. Sick.

We're not gonna eat it, dummy.
None of us! We're on a hunger strike.

l'm awful hungry, Ray.

You son of a....

Hey, dummy, you want a drink?

l'm on a hunger strike.

l'm on a hunger strike
until you let me out of here!

Now you come on over here
'cause l'm not done with you yet.

Has there been much of that foolishness?

Sorry.

John and his wife are dead.
A lot of people in Shoyo are dead...

and a lot more are going to die.

ln fact, you and l may be the last two
healthy people in western Arkansas.

-What's he talking about?
-Shut up!

Our government
is still denying everything...

but the radio says
the hospitals are filling up...

and the Army's burning bodies
in waste treatment facilities.

The ultimate recycling program.

Doc, you gotta let me out of here.
They're both sick.

Keeping me in here with them
is cruel and unusual punishment.

l've got a little cabin up in the hills.
l'm gonna try to wait this out.

And so l was thinking....

My responsibility as a doctor?
Don't make me laugh.

l took an oath to treat my patients,
not die with them.

You could come with me if you want.

John got sick
and made you responsible for them?

Yeah.

But that doesn't mean you can't
let them out now that he's gone.

Ray, if he lets you out,
are you gonna mess with him?

No, l swear.

Me neither.

They'll leave you alone.

l got something for you, mutie.
Been saving it up, you might say.

Things have changed, Ray.
You might do well to remember that.

You might see me again, mutie.

So, what do you say?
Wanna come upcountry with me?

God, you're nuts. He's as good as dead.

Water, please. Thirsty....

Although city and government
spokespersons vehemently deny it...

reliable sources report to News Radio...

that troops opened fire earlier today...

on unarmed pedestrians
attempting to flee New York...

by way of the Lincoln Tunnel.

As many as 60 persons may have been
killed, with hundreds wounded.

Although travel to some
of the outer boroughs is still possible...

News Radio advises you
to stay off the streets.

Mom?

l'm so hot.

You're gonna be fine.
Let's just put you to bed.

Larry, go find your father. He's in the bar.

-He's in the bar with that photographer.
-Okay, Ma.

Take a little sip of this. Okay, Mom.

Just take a little baby swallow.

Okay, there you go.

Larry, watch out for him.

The dark man.

Coming for you.

What did you say, Ma?

How can a hospital phone be busy?

Get back, sit back. Okay.

You're gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

You're gonna be okay.

Bring out your dead!

He's coming!

Oh, God. No!

You were right, Billy.

The center doesn't hold.

lt sure doesn't.

How's it going, mutie? What's shaking?

You're gonna be in hell for 30 seconds
before you even know you're dead.

None of this happened till you came along.
l'm gonna kill you, mutie!

Bring out your dead!
The monster's coming.

He's coming. Bring out your dead!

Here you go, Dad.

Here's some toast
and some Jewish penicillin for you.

-Chicken soup to the great unwashed.
-That looks good, darling.

-How are you feeling?
-Better, quite a bit.

l think l might be beating it.

That's good, because l still can't reach
Dr. Albertson...

and the Rent-a-Doc in Wells
is not picking up the phone.

l just keep getting a recording.

You know, this flu is everywhere.
lt's really scary.

-You look okay.
-l feel okay. Great, in fact.

Turn on the radio, will you?
lt's time for Rae Flowers.

-Not that sarcastic little woman.
-l like her.

Hello there. This is Rae Flowers
on Speak Your Piece.

l guess this morning
there's only one topic of conversation.

You can call it the superflu
or by its West Coast name, Captain Trips...

but it means the same thing either way.

There have been horror stories about
the Army clamping down on everything....

The Army?

Just be patient with me, and remember
l'm running the show all by myself.

Everyone else called in sick.

The numbers are the same as always,
though: 555-TALK and 555-CHAT.

So let's go.

Hello there, this is Rae Flowers
and it's time to speak your piece.

l'm calling from Portsmouth, Rae.

-What's your name, Portsmouth?
-Leonora. Listen, Rae...

l want everyone to know
that there are soldiers burning bodies...

across the state line in Kittery.
Also, my little girl died this morning.

l guess she's with Jesus now.

-l'm sorry as hell, Leonora.
-l think the soldiers did it.

l think they made a bug
that's killing people.

That wouldn't be very American, would it?

No, l guess not.

Of course, that's never stopped
the real patriots among us, has it?

-You try to hang in there.
-l'm trying, Rae...

but have you ever smelled bodies on fire?

-l can't say that l have.
-lt's awful, Rae. lt's just....

You just try to hang in there, hon.

This is Rae Flowers. You're on the air
and it's time to speak your piece.

First of all, l just want to tell you
that l love your show.

You say you saw these Gls
gunning down unarmed civilians?

Open in the name
of the United States government.

Portland, it looks like
the Marines have landed...

-and they don't look too happy.
-This is a joke, right?

-This has got to be a joke.
-l really don't think so, Frannie.

-Hi there, you're on the air.
-Rae, you all right?

To tell you the truth,
it doesn't look good right now.

Several soldiers have just broken in
to the studio. They're fully armed...

and they're dressed
in some kind of protective clothing.

They're wearing respirators
on their faces....

Shut it down!

Bluto, you ever heard of a little number
called freedom of speech?

Bill of Rights? Any of that ring a bell?

Folks, l've been ordered by my uninvited
fascist guests to shut down...

-and l've refused.
-All right, that's enough!

Oh, my God! Daddy, what's happening?

l don't know, honey.

He's closer now! The hard case!

The dark man! He's coming!

Rub-a-dub-dub.

Thanks for the grub.

He's here!

The monster's here! The dark man's here!

Hello there, East Texas. What kept you?

l was lost in the corn.

Then l heard the guitar.

lt sounds so sweet.

l ain't been able to make
a decent F-chord in 20 years...

but thank you kindly.

Who are you? Where is this?

l'm Abagail Freemantle,
and this is Hemingford Home.

Those folks who've got you
won't leave you to live much longer.

You know that, don't you?

l reckon maybe l do.

The beast is loose
in the streets of Bethlehem.

-The rats are in the corn.
-l don't follow you, ma'am.

Ma'am?

Where are you?

Folks round these parts just call me
Mother Abagail, East Texas.

Well, how are we feeling?

Fine.

Always fine.

Just think, all the tests we ran on you...

and we never found
a single immunity vector. Not one.

l'm curious. How would you explain it?

Have you been touched by God?

What have you got behind your back?

-l see.
-Do you?

-l think l do, yeah.
-l wonder.

Where's your buddy Denninger?

He's dead.

They're all dead.

Everyone except for me and thee.

And you're here to take care of me?
ls that it?

Hole in one.

Why?

Because l've decided
a piece of chicken-fried crap like you...

doesn't deserve to live.
Not with so many good men dying.

Those good men caused this mess.

Come down and eat chicken with me,
beautiful. lt's so dark.

You come and see me, Stu.
You and all your friends.

We got to get started. Time's short.

Abagail Freemantle.

Hemingford Home.

You come see me.
You and all your friends.

English

l love you, Daddy.

Frannie loves you.

Fran?

Mr. Goldsmith? Hello?

l'm here, Harold. Come in.

Here.

lt's my father.

l'm going to bury him in his garden.

That's his favorite place.
l think he'll be able to rest there.

l really do.

But l'm so hot and tired.
Could you please help me?

Of course.

Here you go.
lt's a little warm, but it's not too bad.

That's okay. l like warm lemonade.

Harold, it's so strange.

lt doesn't even seem
like the place l grew up in.

lt seems like a different planet.

Yeah, l know what you mean.

l've always hated it here.

All l ever wanted was to escape.

All those guys who used to give me
wedgies in gym class...

all the girls who used to laugh
at the way l walked...

they're all gone.

And l want them back.

Nuts.

For two people from the same town...

two people who know each other...

to both be immune to something this big:

lt's like winning the Megabucks lottery.

-lt has to mean something.
-Well, there's gotta be other people.

We just gotta figure out how to find them,
don't you think?

-We have to go to Stovington.
-Where?

Stovington, Vermont.

There's a government
communicable disease center there.

lf anyone's still alive and trying to find
a cure for the flu, that's where they'd be.

-lmmune cases as well.
-Harold, you're a genius.

That's a great idea.

Of course,
Stovington might be deserted, too.

Roads are jammed.

-Can you ride a motorcycle?
-Yeah. Jess taught me.

Yeah, that's your boyfriend.

Well, not anymore.

Do you think that maybe...

-you know, maybe l could be....
-Harold, we're always gonna be friends.

-Oh, l forgot.
-What?

lt's a surprise. Wait right here.

l found it in the garage
when l was looking for canvas.

lt runs on batteries.
l thought maybe it would cheer me up.

Cheer us both up.

Okay, what do you want to hear?

Hello?

ls anybody here?

Giddyup, boy.

Hello?

ls anybody there?

ls anybody anywhere?

Over here!

Where?

Keep shouting.

l don't believe l need to.

-You're not gonna shoot me, are you?
-Are you dangerous?

l don't know. No, l'm not dangerous.

l can smell your perfume.

l'm glad to see you, too.

Except for the birds, we may be
the only living creatures in this entire city.

Don't you believe it...

'cause there are a lot
of dangerous people out there.

Some of them
are every bit as healthy as we are.

So my gun might not be such a bad idea?

No.

You know something?

l've seen this guy before...

in Times Square,
just before everything went to hell.

Screaming about monsters.

Now he said they were coming.

He was right.

-How rare did you want it?
-Just run it through a warm room.

You know, l was hoping you'd say that.

-Ta-da.
-Thank you.

This one's barely breathing.

This one's barely breathing.

l think l lost my appetite.

-We gotta get out of here.
-l beg your pardon?

l mean, we gotta get out of the city.

l mean, it's not just the odds
of getting shot.

Do you have any idea
what it's going to smell like in two weeks?

Five million people rotting in the July sun.

What is that?

Vitamin C.

Yeah, l'm sorry. lt's none of my business.

Apology accepted.

Mostly because l think you're right.
The Big Apple is baked.

Do you really want me
to go with you, Larry?

Yeah. You betcha.

Good.

When?

l'd say the sooner the better.

Where?

We go west. Towards Nebraska.

There's a town called Hemingford Home.

Nebraska? Why Nebraska?

l've been having these dreams about it.

An old black woman
who calls herself Mother Abagail.

The town's real enough.
l checked the road atlas.

You mean, you're having visions
of an old black woman?

You haven't had dreams like that?

No, l don't dream. l never dream.

Wait. Nadine.

We should get out of this graveyard.

How l love to love Nadine.

Hey, can anybody hear me?

Let me out!

Let me out of here!

You have to.

l'm gonna starve if you don't.

l don't want to starve to death.

Starve.

Just in case.

Emergency supplies.

Anybody!

Bombs away!

Hey, Trash! What'd old lady Semple say
when you torched her pension check?

-Who's there?
-People who play with fire wet the bed.

Gonna stick you in the nuthatch
up in Terre Haute, Trash.

Stick you in the nuthatch and give you
a few thousand shock treatments.

Shut up!

Keep him away from me!

Hey, Trash, why didn't you
burn up the school?

No one's there, Trash.

They're all dead.
They can't hurt you anymore.

Can't hurt me?

-Can't tease you anymore.
-Can't tease me.

Not anymore.

My life for you.

There.

Go, Trashy. Run. Now!

My life for you!

Trashcan Man.

What?

Where are you?

Everywhere.

l will place you high
in my councils, Trash...

and l will set you to burn.

My life for you.

You were right, Lord.

Those prunes did the trick.

But my, don't they taste nasty.

''Once in every generation...

''the plague shall fall among them.''

That's what it says in the Book.

Seems like you maybe
went a little too far this time....

Rats in the corn, Lord.

And the rats are his, ain't they?

Welladay.

l feel them coming in my direction.

Some of them will be going on to him...

won't they?

l hear you, Lord,
and l'm in the way of doing your will.

But l don't much like it.

Hundred and six years old.
Seems a mite long in the tooth...

to be leading the children of lsrael
out of Egypt.

Or the children of America into Colorado.

Doctor said cut out the coffee.

But l just have only one cup a day.

Two cups a day.

Besides, he's dead and l'm alive.

l do what you say, Lord. Don't l always?

l do what you say, Lord. Don't l always?

But even your own son prayed...

that the cup be taken from his lips,
and l'm praying the same thing.

Probably get about the same answer, too.

l got the Lord to protect me!

l ain't scared of the likes of you!

l think you lie, old woman.

Get thee hence, low spirit!

Turn them away if they come, Mother.

Take my advice. Turn them away.

Your blood is in my fists, Mother.

Dear Lord, take this evil vision
from my sight.

lf it's your will to bring them on, God...

better do it before l lose my guts.

Amen.

-Anybody home?
-Help me!

l'm down here!

Please help me!

You sound pretty hungry, rabbit.

Could you let me out of here, mister?
l'll do anything you want.

You poor guy.

You look like kaka.

-Tell me something, Lloyd.
-How do you know my name?

Lucky guess.

How'd you stay alive so long?

l saw it coming down
and l saved up some food. That's how.

Brer Rat. How'd he taste?

Poke should be here, not me.
Everything was Poke's idea.

And you got stuck with nothing
to eat but rat tartare. Bad luck.

Worst damn luck l ever heard of.

But it could just be
that your luck's on the change, Lloyd.

Look here.

My God.

Wait a minute, son.
You ain't seen nothing yet.

Not bad, huh?

l never even introduced myself, did l?

Pleased to meet you, Lloyd.
Hope you guessed my name.

Nothing. Just a little classical reference.

Actually, my name's Flagg. Randall Flagg.

Before l open up this cell door...

and take you out
for a couple of cheeseburgers and fries...

l think we ought to have ourselves
a little understanding.

l'm going to make you my foreman, Lloyd.

l'm gonna slip the keys
to the kingdom into your hand. l pick you.

l'm gonna slip the keys
to the kingdom into your hand. l pick you.

Do you understand that? l pick you.

Anyone ever done that for you
in your whole miserable life?

Not even Poke.

We just, you know, sort of fell together.

After that, l just kind of got left here.

''Kind of got left here.''

That's one way of putting it, l suppose.

Would you like to get back at those people
who'd leave a man to die in a jail like....

Well, like him?

-You bet l would.
-Of course you would.

But l've got a feeling
you're somebody special. A real find.

Not exactly a quiz kid...

but you are the first.

l'm even going to put you ahead
of Trashcan Man.

-Who?
-Never mind.

l need your word
that we're gonna stick together.

No backstabbing,
no falling asleep on the watch.

Just you and me, Lloyd.
Win or lose, stand or fall.

You give me your promise,
l give you the key.

l promise.

You're free, Lloyd. Come on out.

ls that mine?

-Shall we bite some chow, man?
-Bite some chow, yes, you bet.

There's a lot to do. We have to work fast.

-But we can do it, can't we, Lloyd?
-Yes. You bet.

You and me, soldier. You and me!

Larry, l can't do it.

Sure you can.

-l'll be with you.
-No. You don't understand.

l can't do it. Dark, confined places.
l can't do it. l'll go crazy.

-That's great.
-l'm sorry.

That's just great, Nadine.

Why you didn't tell me this
before we got 60 or so blocks...

from the George Washington Bridge
is beyond me.

Because l thought l could do it.

Why me?

And you've had plenty of those,
thank you very much.

-Give that back.
-No, ma'am.

l'm not going to stand here
in the middle of five million dead people...

and watch you commit suicide.

No!

Damn you.

-Where are you going?
-Going to the George Washington Bridge.

By myself.

l don't need this prima donna act, missy.
l really don't.

You have fun getting raped and murdered
back on Seventh Avenue, sweetheart.

Come on back. This is crazy.

l'm sorry, okay?

lf it has to be the bridge, that's fine.
Just don't do it alone.

The hell with you.

l'm going in now!

Don't look at them, stupid.

Larry.

Who's there?

ldentify yourself!

You better start talking
before l start shooting here!

Larry, please stop shooting!

Nadine, you stay where you are,
do you hear me?

Are you hurt? Did l shoot you?

No, but l felt the wind....

One came by so close l felt the wind of it...

and the tile chips on my face.
l think l cut my face--

God, l'm so sorry.

-lt's okay.
-l'm sorry.

Are you still mad about the pills?

-No.
-'Cause l won't take the pills, Larry.

lt's okay.

Oh, dear God.

l tell you...

Jersey never smelled so good.

l don't think you're singing that just right.

Take it easy.

lt's okay, l'm a friend.

Well, l certainly hope so.

Just think of it as home defense
while on the road.

All right, l certainly will.

-Glen Bateman at your service.
-Stu Redman. Originally from east Texas.

Kojak, say hello to Stu Redman.

He's such a miserable dog.

Don't be too hard on him.

He's the first dog l've seen in...

well, since the third week of June.

Yeah. The superflu took most of the dogs
right along with their idiot masters.

Most unfair.

lt might not be a bad idea
to paint with your glasses on.

Not when you paint like l do.

l can't do this, Larry. l just.... Not now.

You can. Sure you can.
You can do anything.

No, l can't.

l want you.

-l know, but--
-Do you want me?

l know you do.

So what's the problem?

l just...

need more time.

lt's the dreams?

-l told you, l don't dream.
-Come on, Nadine.

l had the same dreams.

l don't know anything about that. l just....

l just need more time.

Yeah, sure.

Time l got.

Thank you.

Folks round these parts
just call me Mother Abagail.

You'll be coming along to see me,
won't you, Larry?

Yeah.

Hemingford Home...

or Boulder.

One place or the other.

So cold.

No, he's warm. Not you.

But l'm the one you belong to, Nadine.

-You are the promised one.
-Why me?

Who promised?

That doesn't matter.

Nadine. My love.

As long as you hide your mind
from the old woman, you'll be fine.

-When you come to me, we'll be married.
-Married.

But l want you to leave
the one you're traveling with. Tonight.

l can handle Larry. He's just a boy.

Leave him.

Larry, by the time you read this,
l'll be gone.

lf l stay, we'll end up sleeping together,
and l can't have that.

l have my reasons. Thanks for being there.

l'll see you again. Much love, Nadine.

You were right about the dreams.

Hey, mister, watch out!

Holy G, mister, but you took a tumble.

Didn't you just? My laws.

l'm sorry if l scared you, mister,
but you scared me, too.

You're the first person l've seen
in just about forever.

l made that, mister. You like it?

You bet.

l got them dummies from the window
of Landon's on the highway to Okie City.

l thought a few decorations
would cheer up Main Street.

lt's been awful sad with everyone gone.

Do you like them?

Thanks. Decoration is my hobby.

M-O-O-N. That spells ''hobby.''

Do you want to go on up the street
to the drugstore and get a Band-Aid?

We can just take it if we want.
Everyone's gone, so it's not like stealing.

Sure don't talk much, do you?

l'm sorry, mister, l can't read.

Just a few little words is all.

l went to school. l made it to the
third grade, but then l kind of pooped out.

l could read some Curious George
when l left, but since then l kind of forgot.

l'm sorry, mister, l don't get you.

My daddy always said
l was a little slow on the upchuck.

That's a joke.

My daddy was always joking around and....

l got it, mister!

You're just like
old Albion Packalotte's hired man.

Tom Cullen knows what that is.

M-O-O-N. That spells ''deaf and dumb''!

When they all coming back, mister?

l know where they went, laws, yes.

They up and went to Kansas City.

They're always talking
about what a dull town this is...

since the roller rink went bust.

There's just the drive-in theater
out on Route 61 .

All they show is them diddly-daddly
pictures and they're all rated ''X.''

M-O-O-N. That spells ''X.''

So they all went to Kansas City.

Except my mama.
She caught a cold and died.

l put her in the cemetery my own self.

So she didn't go to Kansas City
with the rest of them.

She's up in heaven.
She's eating the bread of life with Jesus.

Mister, if you're going to Kansas City,
can l go with you?

l ain't never been...

and l don't want to stay here anymore.

lt's lonely and it's scary at night.

Drive a car? Tom Cullen?

Laws, no.

l guess you can't drive a car, either.

l got just the thing for you, ma'am.

Hey, mister, nice bike. Who's it for?

You want me to go with you?
To Kansas City?

To see the old black lady?

That's right.
She lives in a little house in the corn.

She plays her guitar on the porch.

l don't mind going to see her, but
we won't go see the other one, will we?

The one that turns into a crow
and flies away?

He wears boots and jeans...

and a jacket with special buttons on it.

Face buttons.

He looks like a man,
but l don't think he's really a man.

We won't go near him, will we, mister?

Okay, then. All right, l'm ready.

Laws, yes. M-O-O-N. That spells ''ready.''

M-O-O-N. That spells ''Nebraska''!

Time to get going, Stuart.

You come see me.

Who are you?

-Who are you really?
-Your last hope.

lf you miss me in Hemingford Home...

we'll be moving on to Colorado.
l think you know where.

Boulder. But....

The rats are his.

Stay away from her, East Texas.
Stay away or you'll all die.

The plague!

You come on along and see me.
You and all your friends.

Damn dreams are going to drive me crazy
if l don't do something.

So l'm gonna go to Nebraska.
l gotta find out what this means.

-You want to come with me?
-Why not?

Always assuming we can find
a motorcycle with a sidecar.

l'm not leaving Kojak.

Well, you don't sound very enthusiastic.

When l lose sleep, l get cranky.

Bad dreams?

The name of the guy in the desert is Flagg.

And l think he's crucifying anyone
who gets in his way.

Let's say we go out there to Nebraska
and the old woman's there.

Let's say we go out there to Nebraska
and the old woman's there.

''Folks round these parts
call me Mother Abagail.

''l'm 106 years old
and still make my own bread.''

Yeah, that's her.

Let's say she's real. Then what?

Well, it's obvious
she's some sort of magnet.

So l suppose we start building
the whole sorry mess up again...

using her as magnetic north.

You hear that?

How you doing?

l'm Stu Redman.
This here's Glen Bateman.

And that furry one over there, that's Kojak.

Fran Goldsmith.

-We're glad to meet you.
-And we're glad to see you.

-Aren't we, Harold?
-l don't know.

Do we assume they're all right...

just because they remember
how to shake hands?

No harm intended here, Mr....

Lauder. Harold Lauder.

Harold, l don't think l'm ever going to get
these calluses off my fanny.

Where are you folks headed?

-Nebraska.
-Stovington, Vermont.

What? What's wrong?

Going to Stovington
would be a waste of your time.

l hardly think you're the best judge of that.

He was there. And he knows.
They tried to kill him.

-Really?
-Yeah.

Look...

Glen and l were about ready
to head to Nebraska.

We've been having the same dream--

The dreams are an aberration.

Maybe, but we're all headed
in the same direction.

-Why don't we go together?
-Okay.

-No.
-Harold.

l don't like the looks of them.

This one in particular.

Can l talk to you for a second? Come on.

l'm gonna talk straight to you now, okay?
Between you and me.

l do not want to cut in on you here.

That's the last thing in the world
that l want.

Relax. The last thing in the world.

Here you go.

-Okay.
-No, thanks.

You sure?

Not bad. Cold.

Enjoy it.

l have a feeling there's gonna be
a shortage of cold beer this summer.

-l still want to check Stovington.
-Harold, why?

Let's just say l'm from Missouri.

And l don't always take the word
of people l just met as gospel.

All right.

But there isn't anything there
you're gonna wanna see.

Still from Missouri?

You was right. l never should have
eaten all them apples. Laws, no.

Where you going?

Don't worry, l ain't going nowhere.
My legs feel all funny.

My God. Are you real?

lf you're real, say something.

Are you a deaf-mute?

Somebody finally shows up
in this crappy town...

and it turns out to be a deaf-mute.

Well, hi. My name's Julie Lawry.

You can't tell me yours, can you?

Poor you.

Does baby have a sad tummy?

Ain't he a moose?

''l'm Nick Andros. My friend is Tom Cullen.
He's mildly retarded.''

A retard and a deaf-mute. Just my luck.

What?

Do all deaf-mutes have such big guns?

They do?

Peekaboo.

What?

No. Hold me.

You gotta hold me.

l've been lonely.

No, no. What's that?

He's just a retard.

He doesn't feel things
the way that you and l do.

He can wait.

What?

Get out.

Stupid dummy.

lt was those apples. Laws, yes.

l don't want it. No, sir. Say, who's that?

How you doing, cutie-pie?

l heard you weren't feeling too good.

Your name's Tom, right?

Tom Cullen.

-M-O-O-N. That spells ''Tom Cullen.''
-Yes.

l don't want medicine, mister.

That's right. You know what l know
about that stuff? That stuff's poison.

No, sir. Tom Cullen doesn't drink poison.
Daddy said, ''Don't you ever.''

Daddy said if it killed the rats
in the barn, it'd kill me, too.

Please don't make me
drink it, mister. Please.

His daddy said, ''Don't do it.''
Don't make him do it.

l got Mighty Mouse here with pink lips...

and a big old moose over there
crying just like a baby.

Dummy freak bastard!

Yeah, that's right. You wouldn't dare.

Please. Don't fight.

l feel better now. l can go on, see?

Fine, l'll read your crappy note.

lt was just a joke, dummy. lt was a joke.

Joke, stupid. lt was a joke!

l'm gonna get you.
You and your stupid freak friend.

l'm gonna get both of you guys!

Sorry, mister. l cry like a baby.

But she scared me. Laws, yes.

You, too?

Laws, yes!

Let's get out of here
before she comes back.

She's shooting at us!
Come on, mister, we gotta get out of here!

Come on! l want to see you run!

lf l ever see any of you two
in my face again, l'll kill you!

Hot. Laws, yes.

What is it?

Mister, we gotta go. We gotta hide!
What if.... That could be her!

She's back there.
Laws, yes, Tom knows that...

but what if that one's like her?

He might be like us? Nice, like us?

Holy crow! Am l glad to see you fellows.

You boys headed to Nebraska?

My friend can't talk.
He's deaf and dumb. But he's smart.

l bet he is. He got that look, don't he?

Name's Ralph Brentner.

l'm Tom Cullen.

M-O-O-N. That spells ''Tom Cullen.''

l don't know his name 'cause l can't
read it. Sure wish l did, though. Laws, yes.

Your friend's name here is Nick Andros.

M-O-O-N. l guess that spells ''Nick.''

Nick Andros. How you doing?

Why don't you boys climb on in?

We got some miles to turn before dark.

Thank God!

l'm so happy.
We're so happy to see someone else.

Right, Joe?

-l'm so pleased to meet you.
-Same here, believe me.

How you doing, son?

Joe!

Put that away.

Nice kid. Has he had his rabies shots yet?

l'm sorry. He's been traumatized.

Haven't we all?

l suppose so.

l'm Lucy Swann.

The boy...

l found him in a supermarket in lowa City.

He was just wandering around
and eating sweet stuff.

Back then, he was almost feral.

You took him with you anyway.

He would have died on his own.

So what do you think happened here?
l mean, you think it was lightning, or....

lt started around dusk.

lt was a whole series of explosions
on the west side of town...

where the tank farms are.

Then, later that night, there was a wind...

and by morning,
the rest of the city was gone.

l'd say it was set.

You think somebody deliberately burned
Des Moines to the ground?

Yes.

Who'd want to burn a whole city
to the ground, for God's sakes?

Cibola.

My life for you.

l will set you high in my councils,
and l will set you to burn.

Cibola.

The city, as promised.

Thank you, Lord.
l didn't drop it on the floor.

Now, Lord, l ain't picked the corn yet.

Maybe some of those men you're sending
will help me out.

Thank you, my Lord,
for bringing them to me.

Hello, Mother.

Ralph Brentner.
l'm so pleased to meet you.

We never made a single wrong turn.
Nick here knew just how to come.

Hello, Nick.

Glad to see you.

God bless.

You've done it, Nick.
You've brought them through.

You're the first of many.

You're all welcome here.

Our time is very short,
but we'll break bread together...

and have some fellowship,
one with the other.

-Granny lady?
-What, honey?

Are you the oldest lady in the world?

Gina. That's not polite.

Mayhap so, sweetheart. Mayhap so.

That was a dilly of a meal, ma'am.

lt wasn't bad.

Birds was a little tough.

''But it's a hell of a lot tougher
where there's none''...

my own mama used to say.

Now l've made up a cot for the little one
in the back room.

-The woman, what's her name, Ralph?
-Susan. Susan Stern.

A goodish name.
She can bunk with the tot.

How did you know to come to me
in the first place?

We dreamed of you, Mother.

Of you and the other fellow.

The other fellow.

Come on, you. Time for bed.

God bless the child.

God bless the child that's got her own.

l was told...

that we're gonna be
like a snowball rolling downhill...

picking up other people as we head west.

Told? Told by who, Mother?

Told by God.

l tried not to hear what God had to tell me
but you can see all the good it done.

You been drafted, too, Nick.

God has his finger on your heart.

And He's got more fingers than one.

There's dark work ahead
for his chosen ones.

Dark and bloody.

Ma'am...

what if this dark man
we've been dreaming about isn't real?

What if he's, what do you call it,
a bogeyman?

You dreamed of me. Am l the bogeyman?

No, ma'am.

He's real all right...

and it's our lot to deal with him.

God don't explain his will...

to the likes of Abby Freemantle.

Well?

Nick says....

He says he don't believe in God.

God bless you, Nick, but it don't matter.

He believes in you.

l'm fine.

Just thinking some long thoughts.

My daddy owned all this once.

As far as your eye can see.

And my brothers lost it...

a piece at a time, after he was gone.

Finally...

the only thing left was the home place.

What l said to myself was:

''Don't worry, Ab. They can have the rest.

''l'll hang on to the home place...

''come what may.''

And now look at this.

Look at my things,
sitting in the back of that damn truck.

And look at me, getting moved on...

like a vagrant turned out of a boxcar
by railroad dick.

ls that what God is?

A big old railroad dick,
who'd like to whop you upside your head...

if you don't step as lively
as he wants you to step?

Oh, Jesus!

You guys coming?

Daylight's wasting.

Come on, Nick...

Ralph's waiting.

All right.

Let's go.

Boulder, here we come!

Cibola !

My life for you.

Wonderful city of gold!

Seven in one. My life for you.

Anybody here?

-What are we gonna do with him?
-Let him sleep. Flagg wants him.

Where is Flagg, anyway?

You that anxious to see him, Barry?

l just thought....

Flagg will be around.
He's been waiting for this guy.

This guy's something special.

My life for you.

Thank You, Lord,
for bringing us across the prairie...

and to this place
where the mountains begin.

Please take care of us
in the days and weeks to come...

and help us to love one another
and do your will...

however hard it may
sometimes seem to us.

Tom ! Tommy, come look!

-What is it, Gina?
-A parade. Come on up and look.

Gosh, it is!

M-O-O-N. That spells ''parade.''

Help us to be true, dear Lord.

Help us to stand.
