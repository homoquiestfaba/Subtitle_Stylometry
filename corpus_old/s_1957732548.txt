when children dreaded the night,

for the sleeping hours
brought visions of horror."

"The dark times
when those terrible sea beasts

would ravage our shores,

and no ship was safe on the sea."

"But thanks to the hunters,
those days are over."

"Today, these valiant warriors
battle the beasts far beyond the horizon,

risking their lives to rid the seas
of those nightmare creatures."

"And the greatest of the hunting ships
is the Inevitable..."

"And the greatest of the hunters
is Captain Crow!"

Yar!
[child] Captain Crow!



Hey. [blows]

Who's reading this story?


What's this?

Lights-out was an hour ago.
Oh, you'll be the death of me.

Come on. Along. Along you pop.

And, Miss Maisie,

the king and queen
care for you hunter orphans

out of their kindness.

When you disobey the house rules,
you disrespect them.

So we're not going to have
any more attempts now, are we?

Absolutely not.

Hmm.

[door closes]

Hmm.

[instrumental sea shanty playing]

[Maisie grunts]

Fair travels, me swabs.

[metal clanks]

And remember,

live a great life

and die a great death.

[child 1] Bye-bye, Maisie!
[child 2] We'll miss you!

[child 3] See you tomorrow!

[sea shanty continues]

[sea shanty ends]

[waves crash]

[epic music playing]

[woman 1] All hands on deck!

[bell rings]

All together now!

Heave away!

Hold your tongues!

Where'd you see it?
Dead ahead, Jacob.


Are you sure?

Aye, a red tail. Biggest I ever saw.
Just under the surface.

Then today is the day.

[Jacob grunts]

It's the Red Bluster.

I know it in me bones.

See there!

Birds follow it.
[birds squawking]

We come all this way for a proper fight.
And we'll get it, me boy.

It's been 30 years
since that thing took me deadlight.

Now I'll have me revenge.

Aye.

[woman 2] Well,

we've passed Rum Pepper Island.

It's heading for the Dregmorr Sea.

[exciting music plays quietly]

If we're gonna do battle

with the greatest
and most terrible thing in the sea,

it's best not to wait till after.

There might not be an after.

[woman 1] Haul away, all!
Haul, you dogs!

[exciting music playing]

Captain!

It's another hunting ship under attack!

[suspenseful music playing]

It's Jim Nicklebones' ship.

It looks like he's found a brickleback.
I'd say it found him.

We have to help him.

[dramatic music playing]

[woman 1] What course, Captain?

We press on.
What?

[Captain Crow] If Jim Nicklebones were
half the sea dog he says he is,

he wouldn't be in this mess.

Captain, you know the code.

It binds us to all who come before
and all who come after.

And even that rum gagger Jim Nicklebones.

Ms. Merino, set a new course.

Aye, Captain.

Strike the spanker!

Clew up for an' main.

[Captain Crow sighs]

Thirty years I've waited.

[distant roaring]

[tense music playing]

[sails flap]

Thirty years!

Blast!

[tense music continues]

[Ms. Merino] Rudder to midship.
Come around!

Don't worry. We'll be to the Bluster
in no time, Captain.

[woman 2] Drive her down, Mr. Crisp!

[shouting]
[cannons fire]

[woman gasps]

[screams]
[dramatic music playing]

[cannons firing]

It's too much, Captain! We're going down!


It's been me honor to serve with ya.

[bell tolling]

[Ms. Merino] Haul away!

By God, it's the Inevitable!

Have at it, Black Bird! [laughs]

[beast roars]

Let it know we're here!

[dramatic music continues]

[cannon ball whistles]

[tense music playing]

[beast grunts]

[beast squeals]

[tense music playing]

[exciting dramatic music playing]

We've joined.

We have weather gauge.
Shall we draw it upwind?

Aye, and cross the T.

Hard to port, Mr. Crisp!

I'll have her into the wind
as high as she'll bear, Ms. Merino!

Furl the main and fore,
and ease your headsails, swabbies.

Mainsail haul!

[exciting dramatic music continues]


Heads up.

Aim low.

[indistinct shouting]

[Jacob grunts]

All right, ya fish killers!

We come all this way for a proper fight.

And now, we'll get it!

[crew cheers]

[suspenseful music playing]

Nearly there, Captain.

Aye, Sarah.

[suspenseful music continues]

Now, to port, Ms. Merino. And cross the T!

You heard him, ya lubbers!

Haul your mizzen! Main and fore!

Make it scream, piper!

[bagpipes play]

[exciting dramatic music playing]


Fire!

[exciting dramatic music playing]

[beast growls]

We've not discouraged our prey.
Quite the opposite, I'm afraid!

Not to worry, Jacob.

Clew up aloft, Ms. Merino.

[Ms. Merino] Haul away
your main and mizzen!

Topsail, clew lines!

Haul away!
Loose!

[beast growls]

It's diving!

[exciting dramatic music playing]

[Jacob panting]

[Jacob grunts]

[Jacob yells]

[Jacob yells and grunts]

[dramatic sea shanty playing]


[sailor screams]

[sailor whimpers]

Get under the companionway
and don't come out till it's settled.

[tense music playing]

Clever fish.

It's gone upwind.

Stand to. Wait for the word!

[Ms. Merino] You heard the captain!
Hands to braces.

Stand by, all!

No birds.

It's smarter than we think.
The line's been severed.

[tense music continues]

[bird squawks]

It's below us.
[yelling]

[beast roars]

Whoa! [grunts]

[dramatic music continues]

[beast roars]

[Jacob grunts]

Don't worry, lad.

We got it right where we want it.
Jacob, look out!

[Jacob yells]

Jacob!

Man overboard! Hard to port!

Haul them lines, ya swabs!
[Ms. Merino] Hard to port!

[dramatic music playing]

[quiet tense music playing]

[music fades]

[tense music playing]

[music fades]


Captain.
[woman] He's coming to.

Captain! Captain!

[gasps for air]




[breathing heavily]


[breathing heavily]

[birds squawking]

[wood creaks]

Captain, the mizzen's in splinters,
and I don't like the main.

She can't fight.

Then we'll come back
for the Bluster when she can.

Repairs shouldn't take too...
Set a course for Three Bridges.

We're going home.


Let's get you fixed up.

[Mr. Crisp] If you know
what's good for ya,

you'll keep clear of the captain.

He was close enough
to smell that red devil.

But if he can't have the Bluster's hide,
he'll have ours, to be sure.


Why, it's gloomy
as the Helgard trenches in here.

some right proper monsters on this hunt,

and the royals will pay us accordingly.

And then we'll come back,
and we'll take that red devil.

Can we beat it, Jacob?
They say the Bluster moves the very sea.

Aye, and it shoots fireballs
out of its eyes, they say.

It's enough to make your knees wobble.

But I ain't afraid,
'cause I'm on the Inevitable with you lot.

This ship has taken
more of them beasts than any other,

and she's got the scars to prove it.

As do we, Jacob! [laughs]

Aye.

And every hunter's scar is a life saved.

A merchant sailor on their first voyage.

A mother.

A son.

All hunters die of the same thing.

Aye, being a hunter. [laughs]

That's right. Being a hunter.

But every hunter dies a great death.

[uplifting music playing]

Because every hunter lives a great life!

[sailors chatter and laugh]

[Sarah] Jacob!
[music stops]

Captain would like a word.

Speaking of dying a great death.

Nice knowing you, Jacob!


We'll think of you often and fondly.

You wanted to see me, Captain?

Sit.

Captain, we'll get the Bluster.

We know where it is now,
and you will have your revenge.

I'm... I'm just sorry it wasn't today.

Jacob, I hate that devil
with every fiber in me being,

but saving Jim Nicklebones
was the right thing to do.

You steered me right today.

Well, I'm... I-I'm glad you see it that way.

So we'll go home,
collect our bounty, and repair the ship.

And we'll come back for that beast
and bring hell down upon it.


And then what?

What is to become of the Inevitable

after I'm gone?


Through battle and wear,

every beam, block,
and spar has been replaced

since the day she was launched.

Yet she lives on.

It's an eternal thing.

But I am not.

[door creaks]

Come.

Here is my greatness.

My father's before me,

and his father's before him.

On the day we take the Red Bluster,

I will make me last entry as captain.

Then it'll be your time.

I've known it since the day
I pulled you from the sea.

[soft music playing]

<i>You'd been out there for days.</i>

But there was something in you, Jacob.

A fire that wouldn't die.

Then I held you,

and I knew.

The fates had brought me a son.

And that one day,
you would be captain of the Inevitable.

The day you found me,

I swore I would do everything in my power
to keep people safe from them demons.

If you would grant me this ship,
I would accept,

and it would be my honor.


My boy.

You're gonna do great things.

[jaunty music playing]

It's the Inevitable!
The Inevitable's back!

Look!
What a sight!




[jaunty music fades]

[Maisie grunts]

[crowd shouting]


but it will be a short stay, I'm afraid.

Captain Crow will visit
the king and queen at first light.

And when the ship is ready,

we'll be off to kill a monster!

[crowd cheers]
We're going after the Red Bluster!

So if this be our last visit
to Three Bridges,

I expect some right, proper debauchery!

[crowd cheers]

Make way for the hunters.



[Jacob laughs]

The Crown will pay well for them horns.

So the drinks are on us!
[crowd cheers]

No one goes thirsty tonight, swabbies!


[jaunty music playing]

He keeps the oceans clear â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He stabs, and shoots
And kills, and guts â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The monsters that we fear â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He stabs, and shoots, and executes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With cannon, lance, and spear â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Cuts off their horns â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And no one mourns
The monsters that we fear â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So sing the hunters' praises
Wherever men draw breath â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For hunters live the greatest lives
And die the greatest deaths! â™ª</i>

[laughter]
[crowd applauding]


Hmm.

[laughter and chatter]

Hello!

Hello.

Me name's Maisie.

Maisie Brumble.

Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

And you're Jacob Holland,

who once killed four of them beasts
in a span of two days.

Is it true you done that?

Four in two days?

Don't believe everything you hear, lass.
Four in two days? [scoffs]

It was five.

I heard...

[tankards clatter]

I heard there was a time them beasts
used to come right up to shore,

pluck a lady
right out of her veggie patch,

and swallow her up!

But not no more.
And it's 'cause of the hunters.

There's not a nobler profession, I says.

I come from a long line of hunters meself.

Is that so?

Aye. Me parents were lancers.
They served on the Monarch.

The Monarch.

So they're...
Aye.

That's just the way for a hunter,
ain't it?

You live a great life
and die a great death.

Huh. Come on.

So, uh, who's looking after you then?

I'm staying at a children's home
in Guelston, up the way.

Except I ain't staying exactly.

I'm on the run, you see.

And I ain't going back.

'Cause I'm joining your crew.


A hunting ship ain't no place for a kid.

You joined the ship when you were me age,
and look at you now.

You're a weapon
against nature's darkest design.

It says so on page 92.

Look, kid, I'm clever with a spear,
but I've been lucky more than once.

There's no guarantee
of making it to page 92.

Trust me.

Now, you should run along.

Right, then. I'll talk to Captain Crow.
That's a man with real authority. [grunts]

Do you know
where I might find Captain Crow?

Hey! I... I have authority.

All right?
You ain't captain, are ya?

Uh, no, but I am captain material.


[clears throat]

Sorry. It just sounds funny.
I mean, I will <i>be </i>captain.

Someday.
Well, I intend to get on that ship.

So, if you don't mind,

I'll take it up with Captain Now,

not Captain Someday.

Hey! Put me down! Let me go!

Monster hunters are supposed to be heroes.


Evening, Rosie. You go through Guelston?

Aye.

Right. Let her out there and not before.

If that's not too much trouble.
Aye.

Hey! [grunts]

This is kidnapping!

of kidnapping. [whistles]

[dramatic music playing]

[Jacob sighs]
New friend, Jacob?

Ah, just some kid.

Urgh. Horrible things, children.




[regal music playing]


[regal music continues]

Well, if it isn't Captain Crow
and his loyal mates.

Your Grace, as you can see,
the oceans have offered abundant prey.

And I see you've taken
a full-grown brickleback.

A specimen like that
garners quite a bounty.

But there's something I don't see.

The horn of the Red Bluster.

Admiral Hornagold has reported a rumor...


...that you spotted the Red Bluster,
but abandoned your pursuit

because of a certain code.

The royals don't pay you
to honor such codes.

They pay you to kill monsters.

How many more ships will be lost
because you let the Bluster slip away?

with a big idea.

To send hunters out
to repel the beasts from our shores

and usher in a new era of peace.

It's been hundreds of years
since the dark times,

but as long as the Bluster lives,

people will still
look to the seas with fear.

So today marks the beginning of a new era.

The Crown will no longer
support the hunters.

She's quite a sight, isn't she?

The Imperator is the most
heavily-armed ship ever to set sail.

The Royal Navy will push
deep into the unknown world

and eradicate every sea beast in our path.

Not in that thing.

She rests too low.

And them fixed cannons is useless.

And her Captain is an ass.

for you to leave, Captain.

Your time is up.

Admiral, have you ever seen one of them
beasts that wasn't hanging from a ceiling?

Don't send your soldiers to die
in a ship like that.

It's not built for hunting,

and neither are you.

I assure you,
I am not afraid of those beasts.

Then you're a fool!

And you'll take
a lot of good sailors down with you!

General, see the hunters out.
We're done with them.

We hunters have shed blood,
while you lot hid behind walls

and drew lines on maps.

You're cowards, the lot of ya!

General, the Captain
is to be placed under arrest,

and the Inevitable decommissioned.

W-W-Wait, wait!

Uh, Your Grace. [chuckles nervously]

The, uh... The Captain
is well-known for his temper,

but his talents as a hunter
have served you well.

He's opened the seas

and made your empire
the envy of the known world.

Now, I believe the world
still needs the hunters,

so prove me wrong.

Give us one more try for the Bluster.

If we take it, you keep your promise,
and we continue our alliance.

If the Imperator takes the Bluster,

well, you can tear down
the Inevitable for scrap,

and the days of the hunters will be over.

Either way,

you win.

I, for one, would relish the opportunity.

Then we have a contest.

Get set.

Go.

We'll take the Bluster
and bring it to your doorstep.

The days of hunters are not over.

Not nearly.

[dramatic music playing]

When we reach the Dregmorr,
we'll follow the trenches.

We stay battle-ready, clear decks,
sharpened flints, and fresh cartridge.

The Bluster's hide will be plenty thick.

Best to use the long spears.
[indistinct shouting]

but we've got plenty of carcass shot.</i>

[Captain Crow] <i>We'll hit it with fire,
then go for a sleigh ride.</i>

<i>That's the way with something like this.</i>

We'll take that red demon.</i>

For we are hunters.

And we will bring all of our skill

and all of our rage down upon this beast.

And there will be justice!


But that will not be the end
of this great ship.

For no one has sailed
beyond the Dregmorr Sea.

No one knows what dangers lurk

in that terrible unknown.

But it will be this ship,

under Jacob Holland,
that will pierce the darkness.


So let's drink to a successful hunt,
with many more to come.

[cheering and shouting]

[Maisie] Ow!
[sailor 1] What was that?

[sailor 2] It came from the keg.
[sailor 3] What was that?

[Jacob inhales and grunts]


You stowed away?

I stowed away.


Uh, I...

Yeah.

Well, we're dropping you off
at the nearest port.

We're going after the Bluster.

We can't have a kid mucking about.
[Captain Crow] What's this?

The name's Maisie Brumble,

but you need no introduction.

You've been swallowed whole,

shot through the heart, and cut to pieces.

But the worms won't eat you,
and hell won't take you, so here you are!

The right, proud commander
of the second-greatest hunting ship

what ever sailed.

Second-greatest?

Which then, may I ask, is the greatest?

I'm partial to the Monarch,

for it's the ship me parents served on.

I see.

Then they died heroes, didn't they?

Aye.

I like this kid.

She's all vinegar.
But, C-Captain...

Sarah, be good enough to take her in,
would you?

Aye, Captain.

Congratulations, Captain Someday.

Uh...

[sea shanty playing]

[indistinct chatter]

[sea shanty continues]


[sea shanty fades]

[door closes]

[metal clanks]

[gun cocks]

Sleep there.

You're... Sarah Sharpe.

They say no first mate
is more loyal than...


I've heard your speeches, Miss.

My speeches kept me on this boat.

You're on this boat because Captain Crow
won't stop to put you off it.

The hunt is all.

So give him your absolute obedience.

Or fall on that yourself,

because I'll visit worse than death on ya.

You're

amazing.


[sea shanty playing]

[sea shanty fades]

We passed Rum Pepper Island in the night.

We've reached the Dregmorr.

Aye, and we'll find
that thing soon enough.

[metal scraping]

I wonder if I might need
something a little... larger?

Hey, where'd you get that knife?

Sarah gave it to me,
'cause I'm a hunter now.

A hunter who needs to go to bed.
But I'm too much awake to sleep.

I'm on the Inevitable with Captain Crow.

Them pictures in me books come to life,

and exacting bloody revenge!

Go, get your rest.

Aye, Captain. [chuckles]

We's gonna kill that thing, ain't we?

And they'll make statues of us.

We'll kill it, all right. Now get!



The monsters, I can handle.

But that one, she'll be the death of me.

You'll recall the hunter's code
binds us to all who come before

and all who come after.


I see a fire in her.

Same fire I saw in you.

[distant groaning]
[ropes creak]



Beat to quarters!

Let's have her ready!

Today's the day we do what we do!

[indistinct shouting]

Fighting trim! Clew up fore a' main!

Harpooners, tie off them darts!
We're going for a sleigh ride!

[Ms. Merino] Heave away!

[suspenseful music playing]
[birds squawk]

Brace!


[dramatic music playing]

[dramatic music stops]

[sighs]
[beast snorts]

The ocean has sent us its worst,
and we'll send it right back.

Carcass shot if you please, gunners!

Protect our broadside.

[indistinct shouting]

All right, ya fish killers!

We come all this way
for a proper fight and...


What's happening?

Maisie, get back to your room!

[gasps]
Go.

[dramatic music playing]

[Jacob groans]
[Maisie whimpers]

[Jacob grunts]

[dramatic music continues]

[Jacob grunts]

Stay away from the window.

[indistinct shouting]

Hurry, lad!

[suspenseful music playing]

[indistinct shouting]

[suspenseful music continues]

[Red Bluster growls]

Fire!

[dramatic music playing]

[sailors yell]

[Maisie yells]

[indistinct shouting]

Now's our chance!Â Spears!

[dramatic music playing]

[Red Bluster growls]

We got it hooked. Now we'll wear it down.

Full sail, Ms. Merino!

[Ms. Merino] Square the yards!
Get it off the pins!

[Captain Crow] It'll fight the very wind
till there's no fight left in it.

[dramatic music continues]
[Red Bluster growls]

Run, ya devil! And there we'll be!

[dramatic music continues]

[suspenseful music playing]



[Captain Crow chuckles]





[tense music playing]

[Red Bluster growls]
[indistinct shouting]

[grunts and screams]




[Maisie panting]

[tense music playing]

[Jacob grunts]
[creaking]

[sailor yells]

The ship can't take it.

We have to cut the lines.

I've never run from a fight,
and I won't start now.

We must!

Even dead, it'll drag us to the bottom!

[Red Bluster snarls]

[sailor yells]

[tense music continues]

Time has come for ye, ye devil.

[Captain Crow groans]

[ropes snap]

[Maisie yells]

Maisie Brumble, cut those lines,
and I'll kill you for a coward!

Jacob, stop her!

[rope snaps]

[Jacob grunts]

[indistinct shouting]

[sailor yells]

[shouting and screaming]

[suspenseful music playing]

Jacob!

[suspenseful music crescendos]

[Jacob yells]

[yelling]
[Maisie screams]


[dramatic music swells]

[dramatic music fades]

[Jacob coughs and splutters]
[Maisie gasps for air]

[both strain]

[Jacob panting]
[Captain Crow] Bring her to me!

[Jacob] What are you gonna do?
I said bring her to me!

She's just a child.
I'm giving you an order!

Please, Captain.

Bring... her... to... me.

[Maisie breathes heavily]

[Red Bluster roars]

Jacob!


[Maisie panting]



Are we gonna

die in here?

No.


Well,

yeah.

Is it gonna chew us,

or will we get digested slowly with acids?

I don't know, Maisie.
This is all new territory for me.

Haven't you hunted these things
your whole life?

We kill 'em, lass. We don't study 'em.

I guess it's time to start.

[Jacob breathes heavily]

Jacob,

what if it swallows you?

Cut the rope.

[tense music playing]


[tense music continues]

[tense music intensifies]

[tense music fades]



[soft music playing]

[dramatic music playing]

[grunting and yelling]

[both grunt]

[dramatic music continues]

[Maisie gasps]

[Jacob grunts]

What are you going to do?
I'm gonna kill it.

Kill it? How?

Well, I don't know.
I just get pumped up and kind of wing it.

I don't want to overthink this, all right?
I'm just gonna kill it.

I don't know about this.

I'm Jacob Holland, remember,

who killed five of them beasts
in the span of two days.

And this is just another beast.

[Red Bluster snorts]

There has to be another way!

Afraid not, lass.

Well, c-can you kill it from the inside?

[Red Bluster groans]
[Maisie] Whoa!

[Jacob yells]

[Red Bluster sneezes]
[Maisie] Whoa!

[Jacob yells]



[yells and groans]



[Maisie grunts]
[Jacob yells]

[Jacob yells]



[Jacob grunts]



[Red Bluster growls]

Hold on, lass.

[tense drumbeat continues]

[Red Bluster growls]

Huh?

[Red Bluster growls]

[strains, then screams]

[Maisie] Jacob!
[Jacob strains]

[Jacob yells]

[Red Bluster growls softly]

No, wait!

[Jacob grunts]


[Maisie yells]

[Jacob yells]

[Jacob] Oof!
[Maisie screams]



[Red Bluster snarls]

[tense music continues]

W-W-Wait, Jacob! No!

Stop!

[Jacob grunts]
[Maisie strains]


[Maisie panting]

[water splashes]

Oh bloody hell.

Whoa!

[wave crashes]

Whoa. Whoa!

[gasps for air]

[coughs and splutters]

[gasps for air]

[breathing heavily]

[Red Bluster's footsteps thud]


Wha... I could have killed you?


You got it backwards, lass.

I had it dead to rights,
and you bollocksed it up.

Dead to rights?

I must have been watching
a different fight.

We wouldn't have been fighting at all
if you hadn't cut them lines.

We cut them lines.

No, you cut them lines.

You didn't stop me, did ya?

That's not the same thing.

Isn't it?

No, it isn't.



[birds squawking]


[growling and squawking]

We'd best find shelter.

[insects chirping]

[Jacob exhales]

Get your strength.

We're leaving in the morning.

Me book says the beasts
used to come right up to shore.

That nowhere was safe.

Is that true?

Of course it's true.

You saw it?

It was before my time,
but everyone knows it's true.

What if them things
ain't as bad as they say?

I mean, the sea is their home.

We went after <i>her,</i> didn't we?

What if we just left 'em alone?

We kill them because they kill us.

Do I need to remind you
that one of them things took your parents?

Should they have just left
the monsters alone?

I... don't know.

Oh, you are lost, girl.

Your parents died heroes.

I want to believe that,

but maybe you can be a hero
and still be wrong.

You're not making...
[growling]

You're not making any sense.
Why did Red swallow us?

Oh, "Red," is it?

She, not it.

I think it's a she, and I think
she was protecting us from Crow.

You're giving that beast
way too much credit.

He was pointing a gun at you, and he...
He was pointing it at you, through me.

Because you cut them lines.

I don't wanna argue about it, all right?

'Cause I don't want to attract
any of the multitude of monsters

on this island,

that, that I wouldn't be on
if you hadn't cut them lines!

So we're not arguing?

So what are we doing?

I'm going to gather supplies.

I'll take you to Guelston,
and when I get back to the ship,

we'll finish what we started.

Don't... get killed out there.


Jacob.

Promise.

All right.

I promise.

[quiet tense music playing]


the beast is gone.

We can't stay out here.

[Captain Crow] That thing took Jacob.

And I want it dead same as you,

but we'll founder if we don't get to port.

She's making more water
than we can pump out.

And the patch we fothered keeps slipping.

If we stay out here much longer,
we'll be sunk.

[water splashing]



But the closest port is...
Mukesh!

It'll be Mukesh by thunder,
or the ocean floor.

Would you be planning a visit
to Gwen Batterbie, by any chance?

Captain, her wares come
at too steep a price.

To make covenant with the likes of her
is against the hunter's code.

Blast whatever code
would bar me my revenge!

There be no charter over me own.

I'll use Batterbie's methods.
I'll do whatever it takes.

I'd cleave the very sea

and destroy everything that swims,
scuttles, or bobs if I have to.

But I'll have vengeance.

I'll have vengeance.




[Ms. Merino] Trim the sails
for a new course! Keep her full and by!

[sad music playing]

Hey, little guy.

[Maisie giggles]

[creature croaks]


[creature croaks]


Uh...

[tense music swells]

What are you doing?


I'm afraid anything I say will upset you.

You're probably right.

Just don't move.


but I've always wanted a pet.

That's not a pet.

It's a monster, and we're not keeping it.

But I already named it.

Let me guess.

Blue.

[Maisie groans]

You named that one Red.
You named this one Blue.

We stay much longer, and we'll have
a rainbow of critters that wanna eat us.

But he's so cute!

Look at this face.

You and I have a different idea of cute.

[Maisie gasps]


[branches crack]

When we get to Guelston,

I'll get you a cat,
and you can name it Grey or White.

Ginger, if you like.

You're too young to be this mean.

And you're too old
to be giving in to childish temptations.

It ain't childish to want a pet.

Lots of people have pets.

Not pets that will lay eggs in your mouth

that hatch and burst out
through your chest cavity!

That is so specific.

Well, I seen some things, all right?

Point is we don't know what he'd do.

We don't know anything about this island,

except we've got to get off it,
by thunder!

[Jacob gasps and groans]
[cracking]

[both groan]


[Jacob gasps]


[Jacob gasps]
[Maisie] Uh...

[creature roars]

[many creatures roar]

[dramatic music playing]

Best be going.

[exciting dramatic music playing]

[Maisie and Jacob groan]

Maybe they're bonded to us, like geese.

It's the mother goose I'm worried about.

[Jacob grunts]

[trees creaking]

[Maisie gasps]

[dramatic music continues]


There she is. Come on, lass.

[Maisie gasps]


[dramatic music fades]

[creature purrs]

[creature squeals]

Hmm.

[chuckles nervously]

Hold the rudder.

If we can make it to Rum Pepper Island,
we'll be able to flag a ship.

The Dregmorr is thick with monsters,
but don't worry.

If there's one of them things
within a mile of us, I'll sense it.

May be a little off my game here.

[Maisie splutters]

Good boy.

[soft music playing]

[Maisie strains]


We have to go back.

We'll never make it!
[Jacob] Depends on how fast you can bail.


Maybe Red can take us!

Back to the island?

No, back home!

You have really lost it.

She saved us from that thing, didn't she?


Are you...

I think I did the saving, right?

I mean, I threw the, the...
Get bailing! The water's coming in!

Hey!

Red!

[tense music playing]

See this little guy?
[Blue squeaks]

This is you.

You're wasting your time.

And this is me.

And this is him.

[tense music continues]

Are you putting on a puppet show?
We're sinking here.

We need to get way over there.

And I wonder
if you might be good enough to take us?

[tense music continues]


[tense music continues]

Well, if she does understand ya,
she don't wanna help.

Bright side? She didn't eat ya.

Now, get bailing.

[Red wails]
[Maisie gasps]

[Maisie grunts]
[Jacob yells]

[uplifting music playing]

[Jacob whimpers]
[Maisie] Whoa!



[Blue croaks]

[chuckles nervously]

[uplifting music continues]

I told you she was more than a beast!

[uplifting music fades]


[Maisie grunts]

[Maisie breathes heavily]


Woo!

[Maisie laughs]

The world is wide, Jacob.

And you don't know everything.

[uplifting music playing]

[uplifting music fades]

we'll be there in three days.

[Jacob grunts]

[Jacob grunts]
[Red growls softly]

I need you to turn.

Okay? Can you turn?

Can you turn to starboard, yeah?

To the right.

Right, ya dumb beast. Right.

Can you turn to the right? That way!
You can scream all day.

She don't understand ya.

Oh, she understands, all right.

She's just being monstrous.

[Red growls softly]

[jaunty music playing]

to turn to the starboard.

Over there, right where I'm pointing?
That's starboard.Â That's the right.

More to the right.
Look, see? Over there, right!

Turn to the right,
you infernal bloody sea beast!

He's wondering if you might turn a smidge.

Like this, see?

[sea shanty playing]

[Maisie giggles]


Thanks, girl! [giggles]

[Maisie giggles]

[sea shanty continues]

[sea shanty ends]

Not so hard.

She ain't no pet.
Just don't let your guard down, all right?

She's a friend.

Yeah, right. Till she gets hungry.
Oh, will you just...

[ominous music playing]

[man 1] Is that the Inevitable?
[man 2] What are they doing here?

[ominous music continues]

[bell rings]

Captain!

We don't need this. We're hunters.

Only if we kill it.

[ominous music continues]

[ominous music fades]


It's always the same reason, you see.

And I can give you what you need.

A poison powerful enough
to take down the greatest of beasts,

and a weapon strong enough
to deliver it deep.

You know what they say about me, Captain?

Them what come see Gwen Batterbie
get what they want,

but won't see a good day after.

Yet, here you are.

I don't believe in them superstitions.

No, I don't suppose you do.

But you will.

It's me most terrible creation.

The Hand of God, I calls it.

What will it cost me?

Everything, Captain.

I take everything.

So, do we have a deal?

[ominous music playing]

[ominous music fades]

[Jacob sighs]

[Jacob grunts]

[Maisie chuckles]

Huh?

[Jacob strains]


[Jacob grunts]

[jaunty music playing]

[Jacob grunts]

I'm used to a bigger target, all right?

[Red growls softly]

[soft music playing]

[Blue squeals]

[soft music continues]

[soft music fades]

[Maisie sighs]

It says here that during the dark times,

the beast destroyed a town
on the coast of Kra' Zoul.

But we been up and down that coast,
and I ain't never seen no town,

destroyed or otherwise.

A-And... And we don't say "yar"
half this much.

E-Every other page, we're shouting "yar."

I mean, this is just nonsense.

Says you.

But the book says otherwise,

and it's going to outlast both of us.

So people will believe
the beasts destroy towns that don't exist,

and hunters like to say "yar."

But if that ain't true,

then how are you supposed to know what is?


ever plucked ladies
out of their veggie patches?

That there really were the dark times?

Maybe they didn't start this war.

Maybe, but

why would we?

[thunder rumbles]

[thunder crashes]

[Blue whimpers]

[thunder crashes]

Looks like a real shipwrecker.

[thunder crashes]

[tense music playing]

[lightning crackles]

[dramatic music playing]

[dramatic music fades]

[distant thunder]

Nicer down here, I'd say.

Aye.

Nicer down here.

[tranquil music playing]


[tranquil music continues]

I don't know how the war started.

Maybe all that matters is how it ends.

[tranquil music fades]

[ominous music playing]

It's a blood moon.

Batterbie's watching.

Honor is the currency of hunters, it is.

And dealing with her ain't honorable.

Aye. There'll be a payment due,

and it's the ship
and all aboard who'll suffer the cost.

[Captain Crow] Sarah!

Look there.


Riddlebacks.

Aye.

They don't come this far north.

Not unless they're swimming
away from something.

And there's only one thing
what scares a riddleback.

The Bluster.

[ominous music playing]

[creatures shriek]

Ms. Merino, shape a new course.
Due south, if you please.

Alee of Rum Pepper Island.

Aye, captain.
You heard him! Get it off the pins!

Haul away now!

Haul away, all!

[ominous music continues]

We'll find you.

We'll find you soon enough.

[ominous music fades]

[Red growls softly]

That ain't you no more.

You're not Jacob Holland
who killed four of them beasts

in a span of two days.

It was five.

You're Jacob Holland
who befriended a beast,

saved me life,

and led us all the way
to Rum Pepper Island.

[Maisie giggles]

We made it.

[uplifting music playing]

This is as far as Red goes.

Won't be safe for her beyond the Dregmorr,

but we can flag a passing ship.

And then what?

Well, then I'll, uh,
take you to Guelston, won't I?

And what about you?


Guelston is a place.

It ain't a family.

I ain't going back there,
and you ain't going back on that ship.

So all you have is me.

And all I have is you.

And that don't sound so bad.

So, what do you say?

Should we give it a go?

You mean, uh...

You mean, like a family?

Sure.

I-I don't know.

Maybe if we pretend long enough,
it could feel real?

Never mind. It's stupid.

What, are you picturing us on a farm
or something?

I said "never mind," ya donkey.

So never mind.

It's just I-I don't think I'm...

You got something in your ears?

All right, all right.

Well, guess, uh, we'd better pack up.

[exciting music playing]

[music fades]

Well, girl, this has been
an improbable adventure.

And I thank you
for all you've done, but, uh,

it's time to go home now.

And I promise
I'll never hunt sea monsters again.

No more monster hunting!


[Jacob strains]

[Red growls softly]
[Jacob groans]

Hang about.


No more!


No more! [grunts]


Jeez!

the point I'm trying to make here, right?

It's a... It's a symbolic gesture.

[Red growls softly]

I think she understands.
[Blue squeals]


[Blue squeals]
[Maisie chuckles]


Time to go home.

[soft music playing]


[soft music continues]

Go on, girl. Go home.

[Red snorts]

[tense music playing]

[Red sniffs]

[Red growls]

Red?

Red!

[Red growls]

Oh no.

[ominous music playing]

[indistinct shouting]



Just leave.

This doesn't have to be a fight.

[Red growls]

[ominous music continues]

[Red growls]
[Jacob] No, Red. Go.

Go on, Red. Just leave them be.
Red, we have to go. Please!

[Red growls]

[breathes nervously]


[Red growls]

No, Red! No!

[Jacob and Maisie grunt]


All hands, to arms!


[tense music playing]

[Red roars]

Maisie!


[tense music continues]

No, Red! Stop!

Maisie!

[tense music continues]

[grunts and yells]

[Red roars]

[men scream]


Are you all right, lass?

Is Red okay?

[tense music continues]

Hold fast!

[tense music swells]


[Hornagold grunts]

[Red growls]


[Hornagold whimpers]
[Red growls]


[Red growls]

[Red snarls]


[growls softly]

[soft music playing]

[Red growls softly]

[Red growls softly]

Stay back, beast. Leave her be.

[Red growls]

[flare explodes]

[Red growls]

[Maisie breathes shallowly]

[tense music playing]

[Red growls]

It's the Red Bluster.

The beast is delivered!



[ominous music playing]

[Maisie strains]

No, lass.

There's nothing to be done.

She doesn't have to do this.

Yes, she does.

[ominous music playing]

[ominous music fades]


[indistinct shouting]

Ready the Hand of God!

[tense music playing]

[Red snarls]

[tense music continues]

[Captain Crow] Now is the reckoning.

For all who've been lost,

I strike at thee, devil!

[Red roars, moans]

[breathes deeply]

[sad music playing]

Don't fight.

You'll make the poison flow faster.

I don't want you to die. Not yet.

Not till you've been immortalized
at Castle Whiterock.

[sailors strain]

[Red growls]

Captain, might be wiser
to let the poison finish the job.

No, Sarah.

I made a promise to the king and queen.

[sailors strain]

[ominous music crescendos]

[indistinct chatter]

But I'd not worry.

There's no fight left in it.

[tense music playing]

Yes, there is.

[indistinct shouting]

[Sarah grunts]

Raise the studding sails!

To starboard, Captain. It's a boat!

Hold!

[dramatic music crescendos]

By the powers...

Jacob.

[dramatic music playing]

[dramatic music fades]

[Red growls]

[breathes shallowly]

[Captain Crow] I see.

That's quite a story, Jacob.

The hunter what befriended a beast. Hmm.

The beast what took me deadlight.

What am I to make of ye, Jacob?

That thing and I,

we, uh, had, uh,

an understanding.

A truce. Hmm?

But there cannot be a truce without war.

Whatever happened out there is nothing
against hundreds of years of war.

I've always known what I was, Jacob.

I'm the son of a captain,
who was the son of a captain.

And if we are born to fight,
then by God, let's fight.

That we may be tested
and find our greatness.

So I ask you, Jacob, my son,

are you my enemy?

[tense music playing]

[Maisie grunts]

[Jacob] Maisie, stop!
[Maisie grunts]

[Maisie coughs]

Let her go!


She's all vinegar.

Easy, lass. Easy. There you go.

You need to help Red.

She's our friend.

I'm sorry.

[breathes weakly]

She needs her rest.

I'll get you back to Guelston.

You'll be safe.

You'll have a good, long life.

But first,Â we'll pay a visit
to Castle Whiterock.

We have a date with the king and queen.

[sad music playing]

Jacob, I imagine you could use a drink.

[sad music continues]


Good to see ya.

So good to see you.

[sad music continues]

[Captain Crow] You're home, Jacob.

Let's toast to the many adventures
that lay ahead of you,

as captain of the Inevitable.

[jaunty sea shanty playing]

[sea shanty fades]


You're getting your strength back.

Too late.

Maybe.

It's not right what they're doing to Red.

She saved us.

You have to believe me, please.

I believe you.

Then help me stop them.

I've been fighting them beasts
all me life,

and I've seen things
that will never go away.

This ship is all I know.

No first mate
more loyal than Sarah Sharpe.

[bell rings]

[ominous music playing]

Crow's done it! He got the Bluster!



[ominous music continues]

The whole world will know
what we've done, me boy.

This ship, your ship, will live on.

Nothing can stop it.

[Blue croaks]

[tense music playing]

[Blue squeaks]

[tense music continues]


[Blue splutters]
[Maisie gasps] Blue! [giggles]

Let's see a cat do that.


[ominous music playing]


[ominous music continues]


[Maisie panting]

[tense music playing]

[sad music playing]

It was them!

[sad music continues]

Oh, girl.

[sad music continues]

[Maisie strains]

Don't worry, Red.
I-I'll get you out of here.

[sad music continues]


[somber regal music playing]

[villagers chatter]


Why is everyone... [gasps]

He's done it! He's got the Red Bluster!

[villagers cheer]

That'll do, Ms. Merino.
[Ms. Merino] You heard the captain.

Drop anchor.

[villagers cheering]

[tense music playing]

[tense music fades]

Captain Crow.

Well, it looks like we have our winner.

When I last visited Whiterock,

you told me
that the days of hunters were over.

But the Imperator
was no match for the beast.

All of your wealth and power,

all of this is nothing
compared to a hunter's fury.

[tense music playing]


And it's the Inevitable
what will lead the way

into the Dregmorr and beyond.

[tense music continues]

Until the bones
of every one of them beasts

lies at the bottom of the sea!

[villagers gasp]


Jacob,

get back on the ship.

I can't let you do it.

You dishonor me, boy.

As you dishonor all them hunters
what come before.

All them what died heroes.

Aye, they were heroes.

But you can be a hero

and still be wrong.


Now give me the lance.

I thought of you as a son.

But I don't know you.

[Captain Crow roars]

[both grunt]

I gave you everything!

I gave you life!

[villagers gasp]
[Jacob groans]

You've laid down your lance

and think it's made you strong?

[Jacob panting]

But you've turned your back
on your own kind.

[both grunt]

[Captain Crow roars]

[Jacob grunts]

Jacob!
Jacob!

[Captain Crow panting]

[tense music playing]


[tense music continues]


[tense music fades]

I should have given you a bigger knife.

[Sarah grunts]
[Maisie gasps]

[Red growls]
[Sarah] Oh!



[dramatic music playing]


[Red roars]

[sailors scream]

[Red growls]

[Red growls]

[dramatic music playing]

[queen gasps]

[Red growls softly]

[both gasp]


The hunters brought the beast
to the very heart of our kingdom.

For your queen, for all that is good,

strike it down!

Cannoneers! Take position!

[dramatic music playing]

[Red growls]

[villagers shouting]

[dramatic music continues]


[suspenseful music playing]


[Red growls]

Out of our way, you fools!

[Red growls softly]

If you do this, it never ends.

[Red growls]

[Red growls softly]

[soft music playing]

No more monster hunting! [grunts]

[uplifting music playing]

[Red growls softly]

[uplifting music continues]

Impossible.

[Red growls softly]

[uplifting music fades]

[Red growls]

[Red growls softly]

You did good, kid.

I ain't done.


our history,

is a lie.

I don't believe the beasts
ever threatened our shores.

It was just a story.

A story told by them!

[queen gasps]
[king] What?

For generations,
they've taught us to hate the beasts

and sent the hunters out to destroy them.

And the beasts learned
to fear us and hate us,

and they fought back!

Who are you to malign
your king and queen with such falsehoods?

You have no right to speak!

I have every right!

I come from a long line of hunters
that died your great death!

Your kingdom was paid for
with their blood,

and their blood!

Enough! General, give the command.

This war was started
by the kings and queens what come before.

And with every lie, their empire grew.

Now this lot stands on the same perch
and tells the same lies.

For their greed.

General!

[quiet tense music playing]

Let it end.

Let it end!

[uplifting music playing]


Let the beast go!

[villagers shout]

[uplifting music continues]

[villagers continue shouting]

[queen gasps]

Listen to the child!

[uplifting music fades]

Now I'm done.

[Jacob sighs]

[soft music playing]

All right, Red.

We best go.

[soft music continues]

What are you doing?

Fire!

Your queen demands it!

[villagers shouting]

General, shouldn't we fire?

[tense music crescendos]

My brother was on the Monarch, Sergeant.

[king exhales]

[villagers shouting]

And I want to know how this war started.

[soft music playing]

[Jacob groans quietly]

That hurt, didn't it?

You have no idea.

[soft music continues]

[soft music fades]

[tranquil music playing]


<i>One man and one beast.</i>

<i>And with that, the world began to change.</i>

the Dregmorr again.</i>

To Crow and his missing eye â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'll raise a glass to the sky
And we'll drink before we die â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Captain Crow, he fears no foe â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He hunts them for their crimes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They've bit him through
And drowned him too â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And killed him 50 times â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They've killed him 50 times or more
And still the man fights on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And beasts expire in blood and fire
Until the last is gone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So sing the hunters' praises
Wherever men draw breath â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For hunters live the greatest lives â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And die the greatest deaths! â™ª</i>
