Hey, sweetheart, you know me. If there's

For me, it's not a question

For me, it's a question
of to hose or not to hose.

And I hate missing
the opportunity.

<i>I think you're born with

It's Iike you're born with

I don't want to end up

That's my favourite part.
Shoot me.

I beIieve in courtship.
I Iike dating.

<i>I couIdn't just jump into bed

even if aII you're after

I need the time.
I need the process.

You kow, the rltu al

It's not about getting cIose to someone
'cause you're not.

<i>It's easy to think you're
getting cIose to someone. . .</i>

because you're having sex
with them.

Bu t, see
that's the lllu slo

It's happened to a coupIe
of friends of mine.

I've had bIue baIIs.
I know what you guys are taIking about.

Not that, no.
We're taIking about the pain.

We're taIking about the constant
grinding in the crotch for an hour.

<i>Then she has the audacity to teII you
she's not gonna go down on you. . .</i>

<i>I hate. . . I've had to kiII
a few women because of that.</i>

Can we pIease get back

Anyway, we're outside
and two of her friends come up.

So teII me, exactIy how drunk
are you at this point?

Drunk?

No, no, no, no.
See, Rick's not drunk at aII.

Rick is fuckin' shit canned
at this point.

It was put a fork
in me, done!

<i>The onIy thing that
I'm thinking right now is. . .</i>

éPlease, God, ju st

Iet me get my dick sucked
before I pass out.

I Iike bIow jobs. I do.

<i>When you think about how aII your senses
are just concentrated in your face. . .</i>

and what a front row seat

Some women don't want to.
Some women just won't.

<i>The bIow jobs I give today

than the ones I gave
five years ago.

You know what, guys?
There's this cIass now in L.A.

It's a bIow job cIass.

No way!
No, it's true.

I have a friend. Her boyfriend gave her
a gift certificate.

From an ergonomic design standpoint
it's just simpIy not aII going to fit.

<i>Now, the other thing is that
from a technique standpoint. . .</i>

your hands and your mouth are so much
more versatiIe than your vagina.

You gotta be hands on. You gotta be
using your hands. There's a technique.

Most woe a re
ju st ot awa re o  thls

<i>Now, what you are doing
with these techniques. . .</i>

is mimicking
those sensations.

If you reaIIy anaIyse it, it's
a combination of technique and context.

It's what's being done
and actuaIIy where it's being done.

<i>In a car, uh. . .
in a bathroom at a party.</i>

<i>Uh. . . outdoors is good
you know.</i>

You get peopIe nearby.
The danger of being caught's very good.

Yeah l llke that

It's a combination
of three things

<i>One is the heat
the second is the moisture. . .</i>

and the third
is the pressure.

There are just some things
that you gotta Iearn.

<i>So, reaIIy what you are doing. . .</i>

<i>when you do these manuaI
and oraI techniques. . .</i>

<i>is you are mimicking
those sensations. . .</i>

and, in essence
creating an imposter vagina.

Now, going forward with that
you've chosen your Iubricants?

Great. You have your
diIdo du jour. Great.

Now, Iadies, if you can put
that aII together, okay?

So, Iike this

So they both go to Sweden. They both

He orders for both of us.
He opens doors.

You just Iike him

I aIways said I wouId never marry a guy
unIess he orders appetizers.

It is a true refIection
of his IifestyIe.

We shouId start with
some appetizers, huh?

I Iove appetizers.

We went out twice together aIready
and the guy hasn't even tried to kiss me.

<i>Honey. . . he hasn't
kissed you yet. . .</i>

because he respects you.

Can you understand
that concept?

No!

I can't, you know. This whoIe

Sometimes there's just
this need to come.

<i>It just. . .
sort of takes over.</i>

It reaIIy doesn't matter
who, when, where or how.

It's actuaIIy
not even about that.

<i>It's just. . . about coming.</i>

The thing about it is this

A guy wants to come
he comes.

With a woman, it takes
a IittIe bit of effort.

So that's the Ieast you can do

I just enjoy it too much.

<i>I watch them.
I hear them thinking. . .</i>

Shit, he's doing me.
I got to do him.

They think it's something
we don't Iike. But I ask you this

Is this something you wouId do
if you did not Iike it?

<i>I have this ongoing discussion
with my girIfriends. . .</i>

<i>about whether
oraI sex is sex. . .</i>

or whether it's just
a part of making out.

There's a whoIe Iist
of sexuaI acts that don't count.

One is a bIow job, especiaIIy with
someone you don't want to sIeep with.

Another wouId be having sex in a foreign
country whiIe you're on vacation.

That doesn't count either.

Bu t klsslg soeoe

It's Iike I'm Iookin' at my dick going
Jesus, why can't you do that?

<i>I know some guys who. . .

<i>They IiteraIIy. . .

<i>I mean, some women pretend

At Ieast you got to sIeep

Where'd you sIeep?
Fuckin' gutter.

Which one?

I'm passed out in the gutter
right? No money.

There must've been
a car accident.

I don't exactIy know what happened
'cause I didn't wake up.

Yeah

Next thing I know, I'm on
my way to the emergency room.

They thought you were
in the car accident?

They thought I fIew

Then what'd you do?

<i>I went with it. . .</i>

<i>'cause they, you know. . .

I got out, and then I made it a coupIe

No, I seriousIy have no concept
of what you're taIking about.

<i>You take a sandwich bag

Her tongue in your taiI.

HeIIo!

<i>Oh, I'm s. . .

I'm not sure what

I think that penetration

I mean, even for men.

Becau se, u

And when a man gets cIose to orgasm
it does the same thing.

She went to the poIice.

<i>She's charging him. . .

Oh, my God.

And you didn't make any moves

She wanted to have marks on her neck

None of this horse shit that I forced myseIf

She never said no

She said a Iot of things
but none of them sounded Iike no.

Stick to the specifics.
No, fuck specifics, Rick!

Fuck them!

I wanna say this on behaIf of aII the
guys who have to deaI with this shit.

These two cops know what
I'm taIking about. They've been there.

Shit, we aII have.

You're goin' at it
with some chick, right?

And she says
nothin's gonna happen.

Right? Wrong.

What do you do? You warm 'em up
with a IittIe forepIay.

You assure 'em that no way
is this gonna be a one night stand.

Be ore you kow lt

They're doin' the horizontaI shuffIe

It's aIways the same oId story.
Oh, my God.

Nothing's gonna happen, okay?
I can't do this.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Go get a condom.
Good. Yes.

Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap
Begglg e to su ck her eck

The whoIe time I'm thinking
This chick is a fuckin' psycho.

She wanted to get back

There's another reason why she got

You su re you do't

Can we speak to Mr OIswang?
Stand back, pIease.

I thought I couId trust him, you know?

I thought that he wouId never

He'd never want to screw up
his career Iike this.

AII right.
That's enough.

<i>I'm sorry, but we have to. . .
No, don't teII me you're sorry!</i>

You 're ot sorry

Sorry is when this son of a bitch

Get this thing off.
Okay. I'II take it off.

Stop it!

P u t e dow l

doing something Iike that.

Fuck.

Fuck, what happens now?

I meet a woman in a bar.

And she says to me
I'm not wearing any underwear.

What am I supposed to think?
I'm gonna think she's gonna come across.

Women hit on me aII the time.

And they are not
interested in my mind.

<i>There's something
about having sex forced on you. . .</i>

that does cut to the chase.

You do't have to take
a y resposlhblllty or lt

I'm taIking about
fantasies now.

This is not an invitation
to rape.

<i>I'm just saying. . .</i>

that's why the rape fantasy
is so appeaIing.

When you're a kid, it's a game.

First base, second base
third base.

And if a guy hits a home run
with a girI, then he's a winner.

And she's a sIut.

Is it reaIIy
any different now?

This just came in from the station.
Yeah, thanks, man.

Want me to stick around?
No, no, take off.

Thanks.

Where is she?

I don't give a shit. I want his neck broken.

If you knew anything about the IegaI

The issue is, if she was raped
how do you prove that in a court of Iaw?

That ls the lssu e

If I was raped?

Go ahead, Jane.

Ask me. Ask me what you think

<i>We kissed, and, uh. . .
He kissed you where?</i>

Standing up? Sitting down?
Down. We were down on the sand.

<i>And?
And. . . we dry humped.</i>

What does that mean?
We had sex with our cIothes on.

Okay.

And it started to rain
and she wanted to go inside.

And then you went back
to the apartment?

Then he came inside.
You went inside the apartment.

What happened next?
I was a IittIe drunk, Jane.

H ave you ever hbee

A Iapse in your memory?
