Today I will finally achieve
what has been deemed impossible

Man can break the
50-mile-per-hour speed barrier

And you are lucky
enough to be a part of it

"It surely shall, sir"

Yes. We will make history...

or die trying

Die...? This is very exciting

"I refuse to be catapulted
electrocuted... "

or have my internal organs
disrupted any longer!

I quit

He is a very sick man

The electrocution was not my fault!

You refused to wear
the rubber underpants!

Is there no man brave
enough to be my valet?

I'm your new valet

I must commend the valet service

on their impeccable foresight

But they know I only
accept French valets

Yes. Oui

I come from a long line

of French valets on my father's side

"Very, very French"

But your accent...?

"My father French, never speaks

My mother Chinese, never shuts up"

All the children pick up her accent

Are you willing to risk your life

to challenge the laws of physics?

"Yes. And I can sing, too"

Excellent. Put this little hat on

And the throttle in your right
hand controls the speed!

How do I stop?

Godspeed

Twenty-five miles per hour
Pressure's stable

We need more speed!

Forty miles per hour. Hang on in there

Forty-seven...

Forty-eight...

Forty-nine...

Eureka! We've done it!

Good morning

I'm looking for a man
with a steam turbine

There he is! That's my valet!

Sorry! New valet

Good morning

Good morning

You'll be able to let go any second

The pack will run out of steam...

in exactly... three... two... one... now!

We've broken the human speed barrier!

"Goodbye, sir

It's been very nice valeting for you"

Let's do it again soon

"Wait! With you as my brave valet

I can test all my inventions"

No!

Yes. I take the job

Splendid!

I can't wait to present my
results to the Royal Academy!

RO YAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE

And with this grant to develop

new applications for copper wire...

Doctor Ramsey invented this

"Needless to say
the Royal Academy of Science... "

declared this crackpot
mentally incompetent...

and he was duly dispatched
to a lunatic asylum

"Sir, I have an urgent
announcement for you"

Don't just stand there
Read it

It is with great distress
that Scotland Yard...

announces that the Bank
of England has been robbed

My stolen Jade Buddha-stolen!

You blighter!

You assured me that the Bank
of England was impenetrable!

"Sir, I said "impregnable"

"It's the same thing, you idiot!"

"Please, not the quills!"

Lord Salisbury...

"Contact General Fang and inform her

"No Buddha, no deal"

To forego your obligation
would be dishonorable

A woman in the Royal Academy?

We successfully delivered the
Jade Buddha to the Bank of England

What happens while
it's in British hands

is absolutely your concern

"Colonel Kitchner
Chief of Scotland Yard... "

inform General Fang

what other items were stolen
from the Bank of England

Nothing else

Exactly

It seems your little land

dispute has spilled over
onto our noble shore

"Until the Jade Buddha is
back in my possession

you and your cause... "

will receive no British military
assistance whatsoever

"My agents will retrieve the
Jade Buddha once again

Lord Kelvin"

This time do not let it slip
through your fingers

What sort of pathetic man
takes orders from a woman?

Come away from here

"Oh, Dad, can't we stay?"

My wind-powered pulley system

circulates the house with fresh air

Kitchen items are to be placed

on the white boat and
the blue is for laundry

This supplies the house with a
running current of electricity

Electricity?

This is my comprehensive daily
schedule and list of regulations

You're never to divert
one iota from my plans

I must live my life with total

efficiency to maximize
my inventing capacity...

thus enabling me to do
the most I can for mankind

"Mr. Fogg, you are a noble
precise gentleman"

Thank you

"I'm sorry, what was your name?"

Uh... Passport

Too

Passport-tout?

Bottled light. A miracle

Hardly

Just undiscovered science from an
American named Thomas Edison

It turns on with a whistle

Please don't do that

I see your eye is drawn to what

I hope will be my
crowning achievement

A giant moth?

It's a flying machine

It can fly?

Yes

No. But it will. One day

One day it will transport
people through the air

Perhaps over entire oceans

I think I'm going to have
to make a rule for this

Dear Father...

I will find the fastest way...

back to China to make our
village safe once again

Departure for the Royal Academy
of Science in two minutes

Prepare my Urban Transport Device

It's the shoes with
little wheels on them

Clear the way!

Mr. Fogg coming through!

Watch out!

Out of the way!

Fogg's arrived

That makes it exactly
ten minutes before noon

That will be all

Gentlemen...

today I have proved that man

can break the 50-mile-per-hour
speed barrier...

without disrupting
his internal organs

Where is your Royal Academy
of Science authorization?

"Oh, what am I thinking?

What a fool"

That would mean that you
were a real scientist

"By your definition, Kelvin... "

a real scientist's objective

would be to prevent
man from progress

"We live in a golden age, Fogg"

Everything worth discovering
has been discovered

Yet ridiculous dreamers
like you insist...

"on a past filled with"

"dinosaurs" and"
"evolution"... "

and on a future filled
with motorized vehicles...

radio waves and flying machines

Confound it!

The bloody Bank of
England is a madhouse

"Rumor has it the man's
a foreigner, an Asian chap"

Nothing

"I heard it was a Chinese
fellow, and he acted alone"

"Actually, they say
he was Norwegian"

"In fact, it was a gang
of elderly Norwegians"

I heard from a very reliable
source that it was a gang of...

red-headed elderly Norwegians
with very tiny feet

"If you ask me, it's about
time someone robbed that bank"

"Like this very institution
the Bank of England is outdated"

"As usual, Fogg, your contempt
for tradition is appalling"

"You rest on your traditions
if you prefer"

"But, as with this bank robber
progress waits for no one"

"So now you're an expert
on the bank thief, as well"

"Give us the benefit of
your ineffable wisdom, Fogg"

"Twenty-six minutes ago
a ship left Dover for Paris"

"From there, the thief
takes the Orient Express

then transfers to a steamer... "

"from Istanbul to India

In little over a month
that man could be in China"

If we're to believe
Fogg's calculations...

he will have circled the globe

and returned to England
in a fortnight

"By my calculations

it would be closer
to exactly 80 days"

Outstanding idea

"Well then, Fogg... "

let's see you circumnavigate
the world in 80 days

That would be a
fruitless use of my time

I'm on the verge of numerous

countless-scientific breakthroughs

You coward. Admit it

It cannot be done

It can! I could do it

A wager. Ten thousand pounds

"Unlike you and your colleagues

money does not inspire me"

I believe every man has his price

"Even you, noble Phileas Fogg"

There must be something

I could offer you that
would be worthy of your time

There is. Your position
as head of the Royal Academy

"With the Queen's ear

I could lead the world into a
new age of progress and discovery"

Fair enough

What?

"I, Lord Kelvin, hereby vow... "

to surrender my position as
Minister of Science to Phileas Fogg...

if he can circumnavigate the globe...

in no more than 80 days

But if he cannot...

he must never set foot in
this Academy again...

he must tear down that abhorrent
eyesore he calls a laboratory...

and he must swear...

never to invent again

"Just as I always suspected, Fogg"

"You promise so much
yet you deliver... nothing"

I'll take the wager

What did you say?

I'll take your wager!

He'll take it?

Then it's done

A man who has never set foot out
of England circling the globe

This is getting to
be rather amusing

"History won't remember your
amusements, Lord Kelvin"

But it will be hard-pressed
to forget the moment...

I'm standing on the very top step of
the Royal Academy of Science...

"by the strike of noon
after I, Phileas Fogg... "

have traveled around
the world in 80 days!

"Oh, dear"

"Mr. Fogg, we're all
packed and ready to go"

Are you in here?

"Are you well, sir?"

Passepartout

Would you sit with me a moment?

"Yes, sir"

I've risked everything

My entire life's work

For something you believe in

Nothing could make
more sense than that

"You're an honorable man
Passepartout"

But I'm afraid this was a
calamitous lapse of judgment

Mr. Fogg?

Maybe we should
let your family

know about there is
no one left to tell

This house and my
inventions are all I have

And a brave French
valet that will

help you go around
the world in 80 days

You really believe we can succeed?

You're mad

We'll be sliced to pieces
before we reach India

Halt!

"Quite a contraption
you got here, Mr. Fogg"

"Thank you, Inspector"

But I'm afraid I'm going to have
to detain you and your valet...

until further notice

This new doohickey is in violation
of the city's new vehicle code

Vehicle code?

Code 431

All vehicles must be
powered by horses...

or other indigenous
quadruped creatures of the like

Excluding giraffes and

You're driveling

Stand aside

I'm about to embark on a
journey around the world

"Not in this monstrosity
you're not"

That's hot

It's not

Time to go

We have a boat to catch

Stealing a police vehicle is not an
acceptable way to begin our journey

Not stealing. Borrowing

Excuse us

We're just borrowing this vehicle
to catch our ship to Paris

If someone could inform the
appropriate authorities

Bloody hell!

My brain's leaking!

Damn that nincompoop Fix

What's the point of hiring...

a corrupt police officer if he
can't even abuse the law properly?

Tell Inspector Fix to pack his bags

He's going on a little trip

"Right away, sir"

Retrieve the Jade Buddha in Paris

As for Lau Xing...

KILL HIM!

Smart man

"Passepartout, will you tell this
impudent fellow that we must leave... "

within 6? Hours or we will miss our
connection in Constantinople

"Please, we are in a great hurry"

"Yes, sir"

In French

You imbecile

What did he say?

He said...

What?

He says not to worry

The next train will
leave in five hours

Good time for sightseeing!

"This is a scientific
expedition, not a holiday!"

I will not miss this train

Very amazing

What does it say?

"This week only

Eddie Thomason will be
showing his new inventions"

Thomas Edison? Here in Paris?

What a chance for you to
meet another great inventor

"I would quite like
to tell him about my"

"whistle" modification"

Good idea

See?

An exhibition. Science!

"I assure you, these are not
the works of Thomas Edison"

I think he's somewhere around here

Wait a moment

This isn't science!

This is art!

Yeah

That painting is highly inaccurate

"It's not supposed to be"accurate"

The artist views reality
through imagination...

rather than simply recording it

It is called Impressionism

"Well, I'm not "impressed"

"Trees aren't violet

grass is not charcoal
and a man cannot"

fly

You feel something

You dream of flying

Or of naked men?

Sometimes

The flying. Not the men

I'm glad you like my painting

Monique Larouche

"Phileas Fogg

Well, it's an awful lot
better than these amateurs"

What did he say?

Oh no...

"Oh, no, not again"

Who is responsible
for this vandalism?

"It's mine sir, does it please you?"

Please me?

You want to hang something?

Go hang people's coats as
you were hired to do!

But sir...

"In fact, don't!

You're fired!

Leave art to the artists

What was all that about?

A wealthy gentleman bought
my painting for a lot of money

Champagne for everyone!

I'm still looking for Mr. Eddie

Have you ever considered a
career in schematic drawing?

No. It would be far too limiting

At least your work
shows genuine promise

Thank you

Because I painted many months
when I was lacking inspira

I found some men to
help me find Mr. Eddiman

This way!

Thank you! Thank you

He's very eager

"It's terrible, no?"

No. It's... clever.

"He's a clown. And yet
he's incredibly angry"

The irony's terrifying

Is that good?

Is it?

This is interesting

"But you realize
without opposable thumbs

a dog couldn't play poker"

"Yes, they can. "

"Now, where have you ever
seen a dog playing poker?"

Right there

Perhaps I'm not the best judge

Bandits! They came to take
away all the paintings!

"Look out, my paintings!"

Quickly! Come this way!

Go!

Thank you, Miss Larouche
You may just have saved our trip

There you are

I would like to repay you

Then take me with you

What?

I'm stifled here

Pigeonholed

They think of me only
as a coat check girl!

Why?

Because I am the coat check girl

Look what the leading art critic in
Paris wrote about one of my paintings

I can't read this
I think it's French

I wish I couldn't

Why do you carry it around with you?

So when I do succeed
I can throw it in his face

But for now, I need a
world journey to inspire me

I'm inspired to get
us back on schedule

Let's see

Wind velocity
approximately twelve knots

Factoring in air density...
outstanding!

Passepartout! Onward!

There we go
Tell him to keep the change

We are going around
the world in days!

My God!

They are mad!

The balloon cannot
support all this weight

Your hot air should compensate, no?

Get off! Let go!

What are they doing?

They're being disorderly

Hey! Let go!

Passepartout, my valise!

It has all my money in it!

Hey, lady! It's my bag

No, that is my bag!

That's not your bag

It's my bag. You're crazy!

That tickles

He took my bag

Mr. Fogg!

Good catch! Thank you!

Those are the gallery bandits!

The scoundrel stole my purse!

My bag!

We've stolen that old lady's purse

We must help Passepartout!

How do I make this go lower?

What are you doing?

Decreasing the overall
weight won't work

Yes, it will!

Physics, no?

Yes

Bon jour!

Bye bye!

Wake up, lady!

Wake up, lady!

Bye, Mama. Miss

Bye, baby!

Very impressive!

I'd have let go by now

The statue's grabbing his trousers!

I don't think it's doing it on purpose

Oh, dear

Well done

We're still on schedule
despite those dogged thieves

Thank you

Those "art thieves"
seemed to recognize you

I look like someone they know

Some other "Frenchman", perhaps?

So where can we drop you off?

We're not stopping

Once we land in Munich
to board the Orient Express

you are free to go

Thank you so much

For what?

For saying I'm free to go with you

I did not say you
were free to come

I said you were free to go

Where?

Anywhere. Thank you

I will go with you

No, you will not
Miss Larouche, Monique

Miss, Monique

There. Now we are getting along

Look at the sunrise

There is only one word
for it - magical

Miss Larouche!

I refuse to allow you to
continue traveling with us

I'm not traveling with you

I'm making my own way

Maybe you shouldn't travel with me

This is what happens
when you leave your home

You meet... people!

Why are you keeping up this ruse?

Perhaps I'll inform Mr. Fogg

and he and I can
speculate together

A very sacred object was
stolen from my village

I have taken it back

How incroyable!

For centuries

the Jade Buddha has
protected my people

It has never left
our village... until now

Those "art thieves"
who are they?

The Black Scorpions

They work for an evil warlord, Fang

She wants the Buddha so
she can take over my village

I must return the
Jade Buddha to protect Lanzhou

Mr. Fogg is the fastest way

Perhaps, then we can help one another

I will keep your secret

And you convince Mr. Fogg to
allow me to travel the world with you

Keep zis dumkopf in his
seat or we throw him off!

Merely pointing out that if
they coordinated their...

coal shoveling technique
they could maximize our speed

When we reach Constantinople

I suggest you board a
train we are not on

Mr. Fogg, she must come with us

And why is that?

We just discovered that we are
related from the same family

I'm her father's second cousin's
sister on my mother's side

French

Monsieur Fogg

if I make the train go faster
can I come with you?

Yes

I bid you farewell
Miss Larouche

If there's anything else
you'd like, just let us know

Champagne with your
First Class seats, Miss Larouche

Merci

No, thank you

Merci

A tea?

Okay!

"How to make English tea"

"Precisely degrees... "

Excuse me, sir

Fogg's valet!

The Jade Buddha!

It is not a Jade Buddha. Yes, it is!

You're right. But I am not a valet

Oh, really?

Bloody nose! Let me in!

You'll pay for scorching my willy!

Now I've got you!

You're under arrest!

Sorry!

Why the devil are we stopping?

Prince Hapi would be honored
to have Phileas Fogg...

and his traveling
companions at his banquet

How very flattering

But please inform Prince Hapi
we're on a very tight schedule

Prince Hapi demands it

Then Prince Hapi will
have to get accustomed...

to not getting everything he wants

It is magnificent!

Mister Fogg, his house is
even bigger than yours

His collection! His taste! It's exquisite!

Yes, it is

Not good. Look. Broken

And where is his Highness?

The prince is also a
talented musician

If I did nothing but lounge about all day
I'd learn to pluck a few notes

Let's make this brief
I will pose for a few photographs...

perhaps wearing a turban
holding an atlas

How magical that our
paths should cross

Do you believe in fate?

If that's what you call stopping a moving
train and kidnapping its passengers

Phileas Fogg. Please forgive me...

but I feel like Aphrodite
herself descended to earth

How does a ravishing woman like you...?

I never think when I'm naked

I do. In the bath

No! Don't touch it

That is my most treasured possession

I was only pointing

Don't even point

Rodin

Yes. A Rodin

I've never seen a more
beautiful... muscular form

I can assure you...
I'm in much better shape now

Incroyable! It is a sculpture of you!

Yes

"Happy Birthday, your pal, Rodin"

Come, my dear. Let us dine

Yes

Mr. Fogg, please join us

Sorry. We are on a
very tight schedule

We will join you, actually
But just one drink

After the Duke and the
Duchess sat down in the bath...

I realized I forgot to put
on my bathing suit

I'm such a fool, always embarrassing
myself in front of visiting dignitaries

But you know how that
can be, right, Phil?

It's Phileas, actually

So, Foggy, I heard
you're an inventor

I try to think of new ways
to better mankind

if that's what you mean

I'm not an inventor

but I did develop a new way
of irrigating dry land...

so that no one in my kingdom
ever has to be hungry

Mr. Fogg invented "wheelie shoes"

Not now, Passepartout

Miss Larouche?

It is mesmerizing the way
your face illuminates

Her discoloration could be an allergic
reaction or a mild form of hives

Although I've noticed a glow about her
complexion when she's drawing

Sometimes when she's concentrating
on her latest work...

her ears will actually flutter

It's rather fetching

Well, guess who else
was in this bath?

U.S. President Rutherford B Hayes

Shouldn't we be going now?

We have a schedule to keep

Thank you for your hospitality, Prince Hapi

It's been absolutely fascinating

but I'm afraid we must push on

Yes

The gentlemen are free to go

But Miss Larouche stays here with me...

to be my wife

Yes. Wife number seven

You have seven wives?!

One for each day of the week

This is absolutely ridiculous

No more talk! Prince Hapi has spoken

Well, we did say "one drink"

Passepartout, we're leaving

I can tell when we're not wanted

Monsieur Fogg!

Will Tuesdays work for you

Goodbye!

Thank you!

Nnnnooooo!

Halt! Or Hapi gets smashed!

Please?! Anything but my statue of me!

Miss Larouche, please join us

Drop your weapons

Do as he says!

Get in the tent

Everybody! Now!

Come on!

Now take off your clothes and...

I assure you the statue is not
armed-harmed-in any way

In fact, it's completely

Get them!

His arm!

Thank you, Phileas

That was very heroic

Yes, and needlessly
time-consuming

This is exactly why I should
never have let you come along

Kill them! I want my arm back!

Sir, I've received a telegram
from Inspector Fix

According to him, the bank thief
and Fogg's valet are the same man

That numbskull Fogg doesn't even realize
he's transporting the bank thief

Or does he?

He left town in quite a hurry
wouldn't you say, Lord Rhodes?

Indeed, Lord Salisbury. Evading arrest...

and stealing a police vehicle...

sounds rather incriminating to me

One can almost deduce
this entire bet...

was merely a ruse to
facilitate his escape

Don't you agree, Lord Kelvin?

Yes. Brilliant, Lord Salisbury!

I shall name a beef-related
entrée after you

Kitchner? Sir?

Inform your men in Scotland
Yard that Phileas Fogg...

is without a doubt the man who
robbed the Bank of England!

Done. Where are they now?

They're taking a train across India
from Bombay to Calcutta

Thank God we own India

I want their faces posted in
every police station

army barracks...

post office, railway station
and outhouse in India

We're going to stop Fogg and
get my Jade Buddha back...

by any means necessary!

Agra is where we will
capture them

Intercept them at Agra

Carry on, Colonel!

Alright, fall in
on the double!

(fall in: Army term
for "form a line")

(on the double: Army
term for "immediately")

They were the greatest Kung Fu boxers

the Ten Tigers of Canton

Brothers in arms, they fought to
keep order and justice in China

The most famous of the
Ten Tigers is Wong Fei Hung

One night Wong Fei Hung...

It's salivating on these

Is this your goat?

Did they really fight like tigers?

Each tiger had his own animal
fighting style. The tiger!

Snake!

Where are my steam
pressure calculations?

The goat! Passepartout

I'm being attacked by a
ferocious animal!

Sorry, Mr. Fogg

Please keep that inconsiderate
beast away from me

And refrain from your
ridiculous anecdotes

Why do you not like
his story, Mr. Frog?

It's Fogg. Phileas Fogg

How can man learn...

to defend himself by watching
animals behave like... animals?

It is a famous legend

A ridiculous legend

Most legends are born from truth

Yes, but all truths are born from facts

Solid, tangible facts that can be
calculated and written down on paper

And then eaten by a goat

Mister Feelsillious

when I tell the story of the man who...

circled the entire world in days

would that not be a legend?

Only if the man's name was Feelsillious Frog

What the blazes is it now?

Get back inside! Now!

Find these men!

Time to go. They seem to think
we robbed the Bank of England

That's preposterous

It's merely a desperate attempt by
Lord Kelvin to impede my journey

I am a British citizen

I have nothing to fear

Except bullets

Seen these men?

Any word on the bank thieves, sir?

They were spotted on the train

Keep your rifles ready

They won't get past us, sir!

Ladies, have you
seen these two men?

Look closely

hey're very dangerous

They're everywhere!

This is not going to work

Stay calm. Just act like ladies

Not a problem

I feel faint

Women are not that weak

No, but I am

Hello, darling

What can I do for you?

Wait a minute!

What are you doing?

This is no time to sleep

Stop! Stop!

Go, go!

Get us out of Agra quickly!

We did it!

Wrong way!

Phileas! No!

Run, Passepartout!

Fogg's valet! I have him!

What are you doing?

Now I've got you!

Hand over the Jade Buddha

Help! You're under arrest!

Watch my plums!

See? Now you made him very mad!

Let's go!

Stop or I'll arrest you as well!

Run!

Which way?

Down!

Jump!

Go, go, go!

What's upsetting him?

He also wants the Jade Buddha!

Then give it to him!

Wake up!

Please, you must go

My husband will be home soon

Phileas! Help!

Fear not! I'll protect you!

I'm here, my dear

That stumble was simply
to buy me time

This cane is not
what it appears

If I press this button

it will deploy a weapon
far deadlier than yours

This is... a strange knife

Isn't it a sextant?

Yes

Are you alright, my dear?

Phileas, it was so enlightening

Everybody, come with me!

You'd better put this on

Perhaps I should wear
women's clothing more often

We should run

Now?

Yes, we should run

Break down the door!

Okay

Not on my brains!

Give me that Jade Budd-air!

Okay. What's a Budd-air?

Get ready to jump! Now!

It is him! The Englishman who
robbed the Bank of England!

He's escaping in that
palki-gharrie!

They'll check all
trains heading east

Even if we make it to the coast
we can't sail into Singapore...

or even Hong Kong

They're both British colonies

Does England own everything in Asia?

Not China. Not yet

You look troubled

I cannot keep lying to Mr. Fogg

You did what you had to

The fate of your village
is of far greater...

importance than any bet
Phileas has made

If he loses, all it will cost
him is some money and pride

No. Mr. Fogg will lose
much more than that

What do you mean?

My village!

Your village?

I mean... "My, what a village!"

It's beautiful!
