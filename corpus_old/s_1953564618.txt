Why is this thing so heavy?

Oh, cool!

How do I look?

Was that hat in the trunk
you just brought up?

What else is in there?

These are.

Oh...

We may have brought up
the wrong trunk.

Oh, yeah.

Your mother wouldn't want
this up here.

This is her...

Her treasure chest.

Can you play this?

No, I can't play 'em.

Your mother can, though.

She loves
the bagpipes.

I didn't think girls could
play the bagpipes.

Your mother's not a girl.

That is, your mother's
never really been a girl

the way that
other girls...

Are girls.

Dad, I'd just leave that alone
If I were you.

I wonder if it still works.

What's this?

It's a story...

about your mom.

Come on. I have an idea.

Tell mom to tell you
the story

just like she told it to me.Okay.

Well, my, my, my, my...

Hi.
Hi. How are you, so?

And what brings you out
to the fields today, Lassie?

I got something for ya.

Dad says there's a story in there.

Oh, yes.

I'm afraid I don't see it.

Well, that's because
there's a lot missing.

You can see this is our farm,
though, right?

Yeah, and these mountains
are those over there.

Right.
And this is the old cemetery.

And Ira is you, right?

You don't like the name Iris,
do you?

Nope.

Well, how old were you
In that picture?

I was 11 years old.

I only had one more year left
of freedom.

What do you mean?

I mean that the next year

I had to go out on the farm

and work everyday
like my older sisters.

What happened in this picture?

Who's Oscar?

We have to go back
quite a'ways

before we get to what
happened in this picture.

The enemy has advanced
far enough.

Fire the cannons.

Ira!

We are waiting, Oscar.

Sorry.

We're not leaving
grandmother, Oscar.

She will be with us.

She's with us now.

If grandmother had been treated
the way people should be treated...

when we work in the fields all our
life, she would still be alive today.

Please, don't say that.
But it's true and it's how I feel.

Then, please don't say it around Oscar.
Momma...

The foreman said that the place
where we will be working this summer,

It will be different.

But that doesn't bring our
grandmother back, does it?

But it can be good for us.

And that will be good for Oscar.

That is what I want now.

Please, Marcus, help me to make
It good for him.

Go out and tell the girls
to come in for dinner.

Okay.

No funny business, okay?

Please. Just deliver the message.

If we have do the same thing again
for our vacation next year

As we do every year.

I'll just soon stay out here
and hoe beets.

Look how sick that I am!

I'm not sick of it.

What, you're not sick
of hoeing beets,

or you're not sick of
the same vacation?

I'm not sick of the same vacation.
I know.

You like cotton candy.

Little pigs. And birds.

And little bunny rabbits.

And popcorn! And so does Ira.

That's why we have to go do the same
old stupid thing we do every year.

You just want to go see
the Beach Boys.

Don't you?
Yeah.

Well, then get on the train.

If we're gonna talk mom and
dad into doing this,

then we've all got to be
on board, including Ira.

Well, that will never happen.

She hates the beach boys.
She hates everything.

Except her army men and baseball.

She should have been born a boy.

She is a boy.

She doesn't do one thing or like
one single thing that girls like.

She doesn't even like her name.

Would you like your name if
is its Iris?

No.

But I wouldn't give myself
a man's name.

It's not normal. Who's not skin
off your nose how she acts.

Wrong, I can't go anywhere,
do anything with my friends...

without somebody asking me,

"why is Ira like that?"

She makes our whole family
look strange.

No!

Ira, no!

Dinner's ready!

Ira!

Get back here, Ira!

I'm gonna kill you!

You will die!

Hey, dad, I heard about
this machine...

It goes along the fields,
cuts out all the weeds

And takes care of the beets...

I never heard of anything
like that.

They might be working on
something like that.

What's it called?

It's like a corilla...

rilla...

No, no, you mean a corrugator.

See, that goes along and cuts
the furrows

and then we run the water
down to irrigate.

No, that's not what I'm
talking about.

I can't remember.

Well, I got the exact acreage...

on the crop for this year.
From who?

Jack, the surveyor.

How much?No.

Don't say it. I don't want
to know.

It's a lot more than last year.
Let's just leave It at that.

If we know it just makes
it worse

You wannna to go to
college next year, right?

This is part of the price we
have to pay to make that happen.

Besides, you don't have to hoe
the whole crop by yourself.

What do you mean?
I mean you're gonna have help.

From who?
From the little crop-hoeing
fairies, of course.

You are such a
dip, Iris.

Thank you.

No names, please.

It's not a name.
It's what she is.

Do you want to hear the rest
of this or not?

Sorry.

I went out to the labor camp,
maybe with the foreman,

and gonna hire a couple of
mexican families to move in...

and help us with the crop.

That's what I was afraid you're
gonna say.

Why?

Because dad, you know all
that stuff that goes on

when the mexicans
come in to work.

It's a mess.

Yes, but whose fault is that
most of the time, Jane?

That's not the point, mom.

Then what is the point?
Ira...

When the mexican workers
come in Summer

It means trouble.

It doesn't matter
who starts it.

I'm sure it matters to them.

I didn't mean like that.

What I mean is when the fights
break out,

What ends happening it's
always the same.

Well, still the weeds are not
going to hoe themselves,

and we can't do it all.

Maybe we could hire some other
people to come the work.

Like who? Your friends?
Sure.

Right, Afton.
They'd come.

Terry and chris?

And Nancy?

There's a picture for ya.

I don't think you're being fair.

Well, maybe not, but it's Ok
just this once,

I'd like to hire somebody who
knows which end of the hoe to hold.

When will the workers
be here?

They should be here
ready to work monday.

D-day.

D-day?

Invasion day, Aftonia.

Dad?

Can we go into town tomorrow?

A little saturday day off.

But, if you don't
work tomorrow,

It doesn't go away. It just
gets moved to later.

That's okay.
I believe in later.

Who were they, mama?

It doesn't matter.

Where you going?

To the railroad tracks.

If you're not back here when
the girls...

leave for town no go without you.

Down and pick me up there.

I'll tell them, but that doesn't
mean they'll do it.

She's going for the record today,
ladies and gents.

The last time we saw
this young lady,

she tossed eight rocks
through the moving cars.

Today she's gonna do ten.

It seems impossible,
but she's vowed to do it.

The first throw goes
right through

and the crowd goes wild.

Two.

Three.

Four.

Five.

Six.

Seven.

Eight.

Nine.

The poofy-headed sisters
are closing in.

Only a few more seconds left
to break the record.

Can she do it?

Come on, let's go!

She does it!

Drop the bike!

We'll pick it up later!

She breaks the record with one
last throw.

This kid is incredible.

What a kid!

What a future!

What a dip!

Where you two been?

Just down there.

Seen Afton?

Yeah, I saw her.

She was talking with
Tav Jobarth.

I've got to have a talk
with that girl

about her taste in men.

Teddy Allen was there, too.

See what I mean.

Tav and Teddy, ugh!

So, Jane, how ya doing?

Fine, fine.

Did you get a free bowl of soup

with that haircut, Randy?

You're not being
too friendly today, Jane.

I'm being friendly.

I like Randy's hair.

You don't think I'm being
too unfriendly,

do you, Randy?
I don't know.

Why don't you jump in with us?

I'd love to, but I'm in
charge today.

They'll be okay.

Come on, two minutes.
Maybe some other time.

You mean it?
Sure.

Maybe sometime when
Blake's driving, maybe...

Why does he gotta be driving?

He doesn't even have a car.

I don't know.

Well, would ya look at that.

Summer's here.

Hey, Jane, you know what we call
those trucks?

Mexican airliners.

They've had a long, hard trip.

Come on, they don't need us to
stand here and stare at them.

What happened? What is this?

What did they threw?

Marcus, where are you going?

You got something to say
to me, bug?

Did you drop this?

Did you drop this?

That's a nice beaner boy.

You know what?

You can have it.

Morons.

I don't figure Blake
in with those two.

What?
Nothing.

What happened to Ira?

I had her go out to the pasture

to pick up all those
army men.

There must be a million of them
out there.

What are we gonna do with her?

In six months, she's going to be
12 years old.

I wouldn't worry about
it too much.

I wasn't so different
when I was her age.

You know, the funniest
part is, she'll probably...

turn out to be the prettiest
of all the girls.

Anyway, she should be back.

Well, I'll go find her.

I thought she might like
to ride

to the labor camp with me.

Dad...
Yeah?

What do they do in Scotland

when somebody dies?

Where did that question
come from?

You been losing a lot of men
in battle lately?

No.

Do you know how the people in
the old cemetery died?

No, I don't actually.

That's a good question.

I should know, I guess.

I wonder if anybody did
anything for them when they died?

Somebody buried 'em.

Where are all these questions
coming from?

I thought that old cemetery
was scary to ya.

It is.

I'll be right over here, Ira.
I'm gonna talk to the foreman.

Do you want play?

Play?

Yes, you play?

So you couldn't sleep because
Oscar was coming?

No.

I didn't even know Oscar's
family would work for us.

I didn't even
know his name, yet.

You didn't?
Nope.

How come you couldn't
go to sleep?

Because I had just gone into
this whole different world.

And very soon,

that world was going to be
coming to my own front door.

I was so wound up,

I could have drilled myself
right Into the ground.

That next monday morning,

I was up before the sun.

Battle stations.

Invasion...

Dad?
Ira?

Ira, what are you doing?

Surveillance.

I was spotted, though. Dang it!

Spotted?

You ruined my cover...

at the last second.

What's all this sneaking
around about?

You've gotta know where
the enemy's gonna be first.

Then you know what to do with
the enemy later.

I see.

You have an amazing
Imagination, Ira.

I wouldn't change that
for the world. That's a gift.

And I know you're excited to
have these people...

come up to our farm.

And I'm glad you're excited.

They are amazing.

There's no question
they're different from us.

They're mexicans.

They're people.

They're people, Ira. They're not
just big life-sized versions...

of your army men.

You see what I'm saying?

See, Ira, sometimes in the
world...

when a group of people
who are pretty much alike

suddenly come in contact with
a group of people

who are different, they...

They tend to stop thinking
of them as people.

Instead, they think of them
as things

Because it's easy, with
a little effort,

to understand a thing.

But it takes a lot of effort
to understand a person.

Especially one who's different.

Will you try to think
about that

while we have them here
with us?

How much do you pay 'em?

About twice what they'd get
anywhere else.

That's our little secret, okay?

Okay.

Would you go outside
and tell Ira to come in?

Sure, where is she?
Front porch, I think.

Ira, come and eat!

I'm not hungry...

Is that your name?

Oscar.

My name.

Era?

I...

Ira.

I...

Irrra.

I was watching the workers
out there today

from the field
we were working in...

They were zooming
up and down the rows.

They are pretty fast.

When you could tell
clear from the field

we were working in they got
a lot done.

Dad, you keep saying,
"uh-huh, uh-huh,"like

You think I'm leading up to something.
Are you?

No.

But, I was just...

Dad!
What?

I'm sorry, you're not leading
up to something

even though it sounds like
you are.

Goa ahead.

I was gonna say is...

is that if they can get that
much done in one day, then...

maybe we could go just a little
bit further away on you vacation.

And gonna see the Beach Boys.

Rene!

I didn't say anything.
That's true, she didn't.

Hello, Ira.

Hi.

This is my friend, Oscar.

Nice to meet you, Oscar.

I invited him over for dinner.

His mom said it was okay,
didn't she, Oscar?

Okay?Eat?

Yes.

Well, why don't you
get another plate

and maybe we could just scoot
everybody up this way.

Rene, yes, thanks.

Scoot toward me.

Thank you.

All right.

He's a person,just like we are.

So everybody just
act normal, okay.

Right, dad?

That's right.

Dad!

What are you doing?

You're gonna die in those beds.

Up and on your feet, lasses.

You're moving into the field
with the other workers today.

So hurry up!

That's the way to 'rouse the
poofy heads, dad.

Wish I'd thought of it myself.

Now, I know how
Marilyn Monroe feels.

Where you goin'?

What are you doin'?

You family?

Huh-uh.

We don't know 'em.

They died a long time ago.

You no know who buried?

It was here when we started
the farm.

I like it.

You do?
Yes.

You don't?

Huh-uh.

Why?

Because...

It's spooky.

Spoky?

No, spoo-ky.

You know, oooo, like ghosts.

Oooo, you scared, then.

Come on, let's get out of here.

From that day on,

the cemetery became our
meeting place.

Every morning we'd meet up
there

and launch out
on our adventures.

And what did you go do?

Oh, about everything
you could think of.

Like what?
Like everything.

Gotcha!

La vida es como un rio.

La vida es como un rio.

Rio.

Un rio.

Good.

So, what does it mean?

Life is like a river.

Life is like a river.

Okay, I got one.

How do you say "poofy-headed
sisters" in spanish?

Poofy head?

Yeah.

What mean it?

It means...

girls who act too much
like girls.

I think I no tell you.

Why?

To be better to your sisters.

You be better... nicer.

Yeah, well, you can say that

'cuz you don't have any
sisters.

So you don't know
how they are.

They don't deserve
better, nicer.

Sometimes getting all primped
up, I just wanna smack 'em.

But they you famly.

You no ever want hit famlly,

not any person, anytime
or anywhere.

Hit no help.

You be better and nicer
to your sisters.

Then I teach you how
to say "poofy head."

Deal.

Well, I gotta get back to work.

Yeah, right.

But we're on, right?
Uh-huh.

So, I'll see you Saturday?

Yes.

Jane, you're not gonna
back out?

Oh, no.

Is that her little mexi-man?

Shut up.

Make it quick; we gotta
get back.

This one. This one is the
absolute best.

I could eat these until I die
and I wouldn't care.

You probably no have
to eat too many.

Is this one of the tacos that
work for your dad?

Get lost, okay.

Your face is turning red.

You know, if I were you,

I would never bring
him out in pubiic.

You okay?

Just ignore 'em.

Okay.

Hey, guys. Hang on a sec.

Hi.

Seems like every time I see
you're in the back seat of that car.

When you don't have wheels of
your own, what else can you do?

Got a point there,
I guess.

Can I ask you something?

Sure.

Why you cruisin' around
with Todd and Randy?

Why not? They're okay.

Maybe it's the only way
I can see the people

I really want to see.

Hey, how's your mexican
buddy doing?

You guys seemed pretty chummy
other day.

Anything wrong with that?

You tell me.

You know what,

I'm just
going to forget this part of
our conversation...

because I don't think
you really buy in to all that.

All what?

All that talk Todd and
Randy dish out

about anybody who isn't
as white as they are.

Maybe I do feel the same
way they do.

Well.

Maybe.

But I hope not.

Are you coming tonight?

Oh, yeah.

You don't seem too excited.

Who's your date?

Todd's old girlfriend.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I'll just pretend
It's somebody else.

Maybe next time
you could work it out

so you won't have to pretend.

Yeah,

maybe...

see you later.

Bye.

That was an interesting
conversation.

You heard all that?

Sure, I heard it.

I didn't understand it,
though.
Good.

No, what I mean is, If Blake's
the one you like,

why are you going out with
T-T-Todd tonight?

I don't get it.

Well, the way I look at it is,

I go out with him tonight,

have a terrible time,

and then, maybe he'll leave
me alone.

And since we're going to
a dance

and we're all going together,
then, you know...

maybe I'll get to spend some
time with Blake.

See how complicated
being a girl is.

Remember the deal now.

No playing tricks on Jane When
she comes home from her date.

Promise?

I promise.

Doesn't mean we can't spy
on 'em.

Hey, Oscar, can I ask you
something?

Okay.

How come you always want
to meet down at the cemetery?

Because I like it.

Oh, yeah, I know.

But how come you don't ever
want to meet anywhere else?

Like at the lookout or
something?

It's not okay at cemetery?

No, it's okay.

It's just
not normal.

You know what I mean?

It's not normal to like to be
around dead people.

Why?

Because they're spooky.

Why?

Because they're dead.

My grandmother dead and
she no spoky.

Spoo-ky.

Spoo-ky.

She's not.

But your grandma isn't
in that cemetery.

But when I go there,

I feel like she is there.

My grandma died last year.

I'm sorry.

Where is your grandmother
buried?

In the cemetery in by town.

Do you think that cemetery
is spooky, too?

Yeah, I guess.

It's kinda creepy.

Creaky?

Cree-py.

You know, spoo-ky.

Do you like your grandmother?

Uh huh.

I like my grandma a lot.

Did you go visit her?

At the cemetery?

Well, no.

You should.

It lets you feel quiet.

Quiet?

Inside.

You're not normal, too.

I'm not normal?
No, you're not.

What's not normal about me?

You live like boys do.

I like living like a boy.

I'm gonna have to be a girl
soon enough.

You don't even use girl's name.

Your real name is Iris.

Who told you that?

They're back early.

Come on, Jane!
Calm down, will ya?

I brought you home.
I should have walked.

You're not giving me a chance...
To what?

I don't know, to say something.
To say something?

What you need to do, Todd,  is keep
your mouth shut and not say so much.

I don't understand why you
get so mad about what I said.

Because I'm sick of hearing
it, that why.

I am sick of hearing about
what you want to do to anybody...

who isn't just like you are.

So?
So?!

As far as I concerned you're just
like all those people on TV...

all those people who throw bricks
and set fires and hurt people!

What are you talking about?

Nevermind!

I honestly don't think you're smart
enough to know what I am talking about.

What? You don't think I could
do the things I say I do?

No, that's not what I'm talking
about, but suit your brother...

But let me tell you what I think.

I think if you and your goons
ever got a chance to do anything,

any of those people around
you'd all get your faces kicked in.

Is that right?
That's right!

Does that go for your beaner
boyfriend, too?

I don't have a beaner boyfriend.

But if you're talking about a
certain person that works here,

I'd say that goes especially
for him.

I'm gonna walk home.

That was incredible.

Are we leaving?

Yup, we're leavin'.

What a show!

Remind me never to get Jane
that mad at me.

She ate Todd up and spit
him out.

I can see pieces of him all
over the driveway.

Hey, where you goin'?

It time to go.

You all right?

All right, yes.

I'll see you tomorrow.

What is this, huh?

Get a little soft,
huh, Blakey boy.

Why don't you go back up
there to Jane

and tell her how great you
are now.

Yeah, she'll cuddle
right up to ya.

Come on, this is your big
chance to win her heart.

Okay, fine, walk home and
don't say anything.

It's no skin off my nose.
All right. I'll say something.

Jane is right!

Get out!
What?

Get out, I said.
Hurry up!

Randy?
Todd?

Shut up! Look, get out
right now!

Make couple seconds or you're
gonna be trapped...

And you're not gonna like it!

Come on!

So, you think Jane was
right, huh?

Well, let's find out.
What are you gonna do?

Watch!

Todd!

Ira, go get your dad!

What's goin' on?
Just go get him.

Hurry!

Todd, don't do this!

This isn't right.
Shut up!

What's goin' on?
Todd's gone crazy.

This isn't just calling names
and picking fights.

This is bad, Todd, come on!
Shu up!

Oscar!

Come on!

You wanna kick my face in now?
Come on!

Come on! Come on, hurry up!

There's Todd's car.

Down here.

I'll get an ambulance.
There's no time for that.

Let's get him out. Right.
Be carefull.

Let's get him in the back.

I'll go get Todd.

George, what happened?

I don't have time to explain.
Just get in and get us to the hospital.

I wanna go, too.
Ira, please stay.

Where's Todd?

Where is he?!
I didn't want that to happen!

Then why didn't you do
something?!

I didn't want that to happen.

Why didn't I do something?

Everything was different after
that night.

Marcus was in the hospital and...

there was this sudden change
of feeling.

Like a wall had gone up
between us.

We all felt it immediately.

What did they say?

They didn't have to say
anything.

What do you mean?

Well, it was like they connected
us to what had happened.

But you didn't do anything.

Yeah, but try and put yourself
in their position.

I mean, one night suddenly
some boys...

come driving through your home,

and one of them was seriously
hurt.

Well, I think they did what we
all tend to do...

when something bad happens,

Just lump people into groups.

And I think they lumped us into
the same group with those boys.

Do you see what I mean?

Not really.

Well, I didn't either.

But all I could understand...

is that Oscar and me weren't
friends anymore.

The workers were still doing
their job,

but nothing was the same.

Oscar and me didn't play
anymore.

He spent everyday in the
fields with his family...

because Marcus couldn't work.

One day when Marcus got out
of the hospital,

Jane and Blake went down to
see him,

but his mother just told them
that he didn't want to see anybody.

Summer finally ended,

but the workers still weren't
finished.

Mom talked to Oscar's mother

and told her we could
hire more workers to help
finish...

the job before their permits
ran out.

But she told mom
they'd made a commitment

and they would keep it.

Almost everyday I saw trucks
with other workers...

heading south to go home
to mexico.

It was a sad time for me.

Those last days of summer
passed by very slowly.

Hey, Ira! Is that your little
beaner boyfriend?

Your little brother's got a
big mouth, Tim.

So? So...

maybe you should talk with
him about his language.

Maybe I don't have a problem
with his language.

Maybe you won't have a problem
if I put my fist in his face then.

Stay out of this, Rene.

Since you put it that way,
Rene...

I know how tough you MacLaren
girls are.

Not so sure about the boys.

Just don't let 'em get to
you, Ira.

Yeah, just ignore them.

Did you really make friends
with a mexican?

I mean, It really doesn't
matter to me.

Besides, I think those guys
on the bus are creeps.

And I bet your sister could
have put 'em in their place.

Who are you?

My name's Jim. I'm new.

Where'd you move from?

American falls.

Ever heard of it?
Nice place.

All eyes to the front now,
please.

Who can tell me what's different
about becoming a sixth grader?

Well, the first thing is we
get right to work.

In fact, tonight all of you
will be going home with homework.

Hi.

Hi.

Saw you sitting here all alone.

Yeah, I think I got a disease
or something.

Better be careful.

You look okay to me.

Are you lost?

I don't like the way your sister
talked to me and my brother on the bus.

Well, why don't you go talk to
her, then.

Very funny.

I'm not trying to be funny.

I heard about what happened
on your farm...

How the mexi got hit
by the car.

We all think it would have
been a lot better

If more of the car had
hit him.

Well, though.

You know, it's too bad that his
whole family didn't get hit,

If you ask me.

Well, she didn't ask you.

Watch your mouth, new boy.

Yes, sir.

So...

what's it like having a mex
for a friend?

That's what I thought.

I wouldn't talk about it,
either.

Here, can you take this?

Yeah.

I'll see you inside.

So, are you lost?

My friends aren't mexs or
anything else you call them.

They're people, just like you and me.
They are peolple.

I think they're greasy
little animals...

Things that like to eat bugs...

My friend's name is Oscar.

He's the best friend I ever had.

He's the best friend anyone
could ever have.

I'd pick him for a friend
over anyone else,

So don't ever call him any of
your little names again.

You better be ready to take back
what you said to me.

I'm not gonna take it back.

Then you better be ready to fight.

I'm not gonna fight, either.

Look, I'm not gonna fight

and I'm not gonna take back
what I said.

If you don't decide what you're
gonna do, we'll decide for you.

It's three to one, Iris.

It's three to two.

There's a fight on the
playground!

Whatever it is, we'll take
care of it.

Come on, Ira.
Let's go.

Mom.

Jim, what in the world...?

I'm  okay.
You got a great kid there.

You should be very proud
of him.

See ya tomorrow, Ira.

Yeah, see ya.

Thanks.

Do you want to let any of those
deep thoughts spill out over to me?

I'm proud of you, Ira.

I just hate to see you get
into fights.

Why? 'Cuz I'm a girl.

No, because I don't think
it's right.

Do you think a fight on the
playground...

changed those boys' minds
about anything?

No.

But it wasn't really a fight.

I was just defending myself.

Well, that's what the principal
told me.

Glad to hear you  say the
same thing.

You had every right to
defend yourself.

All I was trying to do
was stand up for Oscar.

I know you were. That was the
right thing to do.

Yeah, I guess.

But...
What's the point of standing up for him?

It didn't do anything,

Except that everybody
hates me now.

Sometimes that's the price you
get paid for being a real friend.

Well, why should I be a real friend...

to someone that doesn't want to
be my friend anymore?

Oscar hates me now too,

And I didn't even do anything
to him.

Are you really sorry you
stood up for Oscar?

Maybe.

Well, I'll tell you something.

If Oscar had seen how you
stuck up for him today,

he would feel a lot different.

Yeah, well...
He didn't see.

Hello.

How are you, Oscar?

Maria?

We've missed you.

I came over 'cuz I wanted
to tell you

about something that happened
to Ira today.

At school?

At school, yes.

I also brought this for you.

She was going to give it to
you,

but after Marcus got hurt,

What happened to Ira at school?

Hi.

Hi. Is Iris here?

Oscar wants to know if Iris
is here.

Umm, no, she's outside,
somewhere.

You want me to try and find
her?

No, I know where is.

I wonder if you could give
this to your friend.

My friend?

The one who tried to help.

Oh, you mean Blake.

Yeah, he helped the sheriff
find the boy

who was driving the car.

Yes, your mother tell me.

This tell him thank you
very much.

This will mean a lot to him.

I'll make sure he gets it.

Thank you.

It's nice to see you again.

You know, i was just about
to go for a walk.

Would you like to come?

We could talk some more.

Yes, yes, thank you.

I thought I'd bought the farm.

Yes, very spooked.

Is that the end of the story?
Just about.

But that's why you drew
the picture, isn't it?

Because of what happened
with the snake.

I didn't draw the picture.
Oscar did.

Well, Oscar gave it to you?

Sort of.

Well, did he or didn't he?

Well, let me finish telling
you the story

and you'll understand.

Hey, what's mom doin'?

Are you okay?

Oh, yeah.

Just a little sad.

Why?

Well...

U.S. immigration agents
came out today...

and told our workers they had
to leave the country,
immediately.

Why did they do that?

Their permits expired about
two or three weeks ago.

So, they're gone?

I didn't even get to say
goodbye.

Will we ever see them again?

I don't know.

Sometimes when they stay
as long as they did,

they don't let them come
back again.

Do you wanna ride back
with us?

Yeah, I guess.

What's that?

It's a story.

Did you ever see Oscar again?

No, I never did.

But I've thought about him
many, many times.

I've wondered where he
ended up living.

I've wondered if he had
a chance

to have a family like I did.

I've wondered if he thinks
about me

and the time we spent together
that summer.

Do you ever wonder if he kept...

the picture that you
made for him?

I even wonder about that.

Really?

Really!

Because except for you and dad.

And the rest of our family,

I've never had a better friend
than Oscar.

I don't think I ever will.

Did you guys ever find out

who was buried at the
old cemetery?

Nope, we never did.

My attitude changed
toward the cemetery because Oscar.

# Somewhere children are playing, #

# and somewhere children
are saying, #

# I see that we don't look
the same. #

# Though now and then your
words are strange, #

# I wonder if we'll see the day #

# Where you and I as friends
can stay. #

Did your dad ever tell you

what they do in scotland for
people who died?

Yeah?

I got an idea.

# In friendship's field #

# We'll meet each other.#

# We'll make our way there
to grow together. #

# We'll find our way back home #

# to friendship's field. #

# The years have come and gone, #

# but inside there still lives on #

# All the strength you gave me,
warm and safe. #

# Tonight I'm wishing on a star #

# Somehow the world will hear
my heart #

# That reached-out arms
all feel the same. #

# That different's
just another way #

# And kindness leads us
to that place #

# Where soon we all
as friends can stay. #

# In friendship's field
we'll meet each other. #

# We'll make our way there
to grow together. #

# We'll find our way back home. #

# In friendship's field #

# We are forever, #

# Where friends together
are for each other. #

# We'll always be at home #

# in friendship's field. #

# Tonight, I'm wishing on a star #

# That all the world can hear
their hearts. #
