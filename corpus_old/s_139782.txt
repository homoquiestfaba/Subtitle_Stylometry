I won't... I won't forget
your kindness.

I lived there once.

A long time ago.

Go.

<i>Police radio:
105 North Avenue 52.</i>

<i>Call again.</i>

Donuts, Michael?
You kill me.

Mmm.
So I am a walking clich√©.

Is that what I think it is?

Maple-glazed buttermilk.

You'll enjoy the regular glazed.

Oh, God!

Um, actually I'd enjoy it better
if you eased off the gas.

What's the rush?
They found number three.

How do you know
it's the same perp?

Sure looks like his signature.

Did he cut out a liver?

Or a kidney?
This time it was the heart.

<i>Oh God!</i>

Hello?

Is anybody there?

Who the heck are you?

I'm here for Ben.

Ben's dead.

A mugging.

<i>He got shot.</i>

Anyway...

you missed him
by a week.

<i>In the old days...</i>

a face like yours was worth gold
in the freak shows.

You must be Deucalion.

I've had many names.

That's what Ben called you.

Said you were one
of his top draws.

They called me

"The Monster. "

O'Conner:
Oh, great!

<i>Dispatcher:
Unit 16 responding code 3.</i>

<i>- Oh, jeez.
Unit 4 responding code 3.</i>

Detective Harker.

Frye.
You're up early.

Well...

we were in the area.
We got the call.

No, this is our case.

Last week's liver man
is this week's thief of hearts.

There's no connection, Sloane.

There will be.
Did you ID the victim yet?

Yeah.
Robert Vincent Allwyne.

Library's night security man.

Excuse me.

<i>Dispatcher:
Unit 52 code 12...</i>

Carson.

They're saying the killer
had some skill.

He, uh...
cracked the breast plate,

extracting the uh...
heart with precision.

Then he travels
with tools, right?

Should be his Indian name.

I don't want to give Harker and Frye
any more ammo,

but uh,
Carson, the body is behind you.

Did you see the books?

Yeah,
it must have been a hell of a struggle.

No signs of a struggle.

Yeah? Tell that to the dude
without a heart.

The guard's gun
is still holstered.

And some of these books
are stacked pretty neatly.

<i>Check this out.</i>

<i>The book was opened on this page
when the killing occurred.</i>

So what,
the killer kicked back,

read a chapter or two
after he diced the guy out?

What is that, anyway?

"Auburn Psychology,"
a self-help book?

<i>Harker:
You found something?</i>

Just enough
to make me sure I'm right.

What might that be?

Read it in our report, or are you still
"hooked on phonics?"

Sloane:
Oh-oh!

Who found the body?

Librarian.
Nancy Whistler.

She's um...

she's in the can.

Apparently she won't come out.

I'm Detective O'Conner.
Detective Sloane.

Are you all right?

Every time I think
I just can't puke again, I do.

Sloane:
I love this job.

You were the first
to enter the library this morning?

<i>You're sure the place
was locked up?</i>

I'm sure.
God, he was such a toad.

But he didn't deserve that.

<i>Bobby Allwyne, the guard.</i>

He was a creep.

But why would someone
take his heart?

I don't know.
Souvenir.

Sexual gratification,
dinner.

Oh-hh.

Nice!

<i>What?</i>

<i>Sloane:
Bobby Allwyne.</i>

Room 301.

Did you call the super?
Get the keys?

I got my lock pick.

Okay.
And how about a warrant?

You can't violate the rights
of a dead guy.

Yeah, I guess that's true.

<i>O'Conner:
Lacks a feminine touch.</i>

Sloane:
Shabby Goth.

I'm fine.

Yeah?

I'm okay.

<i>It looks like the victim's crazier
than the killer.</i>

Uh, Carson.

<i>You're gonna want
to take a little look at this.</i>

Ben told me
one day you'd come.

Here.

He wanted you
to have this.

Helios.

<i>Woman:
Do you know who he is,</i>

this man Helios?

Do you know what I am?

I know what Ben
thought you were.

And do you know
why I've come?

To kill that man?

There are fingerprints
in some of these glasses.

Too much greenery.
Emphasize the blooms.

I didn't arrange the lilies, sir.

<i>Mrs. Helios preferred
to do it herself.</i>

You do them.

But don't say anything to my wife.
She'll learn.

You can't improve
on perfection.

That's sweet.

I like looking nice for you.

Then wash most of that off.

Let your natural beauty
shine through.

The guests won't look ridiculous.
Neither should you.

Diamonds would be
a better choice.

Your standards are...

so high.

That's why I made you...

my wife.

<i>Harker:
Yo, O'Conner?</i>

I feel for you, O'Conner.

I do.

I'm your best friend.

I think it's karma that brought us
together, don't you, Harker?

<i>Are you gonna make a report?</i>

Wouldn't be doing my homework
if I didn't.

Too bad Allwyne

wasn't one of The Surgeon's victims,
though.

Really, based on what?

Well,

the other two were abducted
from their homes, bound and gagged.

Allwyne was just laying there
like he wanted to be butchered.

Assisted suicide.

With a little twist.

I bet any day now,

we're gonna find some nutty Goth
with a bloody scalpel in his hand

and a heart in his back pocket.

No, I was a Goth in high school
and I take offense to that comment.

I'm just trying to be helpful.

The guy was suicidal.

This is not your case!

Come on!

Razor blades and black rooms.

The guy had a death wish.
You searched Allwyne's apartment?

Don't piggyback my case!

I'm just trying to cover your ass!

You mean my nice ass?

Biotechnology is a tool,
nothing more.

One man's tool
is another man's weapon.

<i>Precisely.</i>

A gun can save a life
or take one.

Depends on the man
who uses it.

And then the argument becomes,
which man gets the power?

The ability to manipulate
our genome.

That power should be in the hands

of those with vision.

A vision for the future.

<i>And that's exactly
what disturbs me, Doctor.</i>

The flowers are perfect.

Sorry, Victor.

We'll discuss it later. Not now!
Let me just...

<i>Guest:
So, father...</i>

what do you make
of all this...

stem cell research,
this cloning?

I've been fortunate to be a guest
at this table for quite a while...

<i>and I've learned over the years</i>

<i>that nobody really
wants to have dinner</i>

with a disagreeable old priest.

Therefore,
I agree with Dr. Helios.

Whatever he says.

Well,
I stand corrected.

<i>Cheers!</i>

Woman:
Damn thing!

<i>Deucalion:
You should get cable.</i>

<i>Anchorwoman:
The mutilated body of a 35 year-old man</i>

<i>was discovered this morning
at the central library.</i>

<i>Police are investigating whether this
may be the third victim</i>

<i>of a serial killer known as
"The Surgeon. "</i>

<i>Two other recent murders
have been attributed to this killer.</i>

<i>His signature is the removal
of body parts and internal organs</i>

<i>with surgical precision, apparently.</i>

<i>Last night's slaying is similar
to other Surgeon murders,</i>

<i>though police are only providing
sketchy details.</i>

I'm sorry, Victor.

It's not your fault.

I don't excite you.

Usually, yes.

Tonight, no.

<i>I'm going to go
to the hospital.</i>

I am in a creative mood.

Victor.

I want to please you.

More than anything.

But sometimes I just don't know
what you want.

Perfection.

The M.E. Should be about done.

I want to hit the morgue tonight.

Right.

Hey, look.
Why don't we blow off the morgue?

<i>Look, between the department
and your brother,</i>

you don't sleep.

So which isn't important,
my job or my brother?

I just... I just think you should
take a break once in a while.

The Surgeon is not taking
a break.

Even psychotic killers
take the occasional nap.

<i>You know, go see a movie.</i>

Sloane.

<i>Oh, really?</i>

We'll be right there.

The M.E. Is done
with Allwyne's body.

He says he found something.
He says we have to see it to believe it.

Wait, my drink!

Yes.

Something's happening to me.

Who is this?

I want an explanation.

Are you one of mine?

<i>Yes.
Please help me, I'm very scared.</i>

I've begun to change.

What do you mean, change?

Something inside.
I can feel it, there's something there.

Come to me.

I'll give you

whatever guidance you need.

I've killed three men.

The third was one of yours.

<i>You watch the news?</i>

<i>Gentlemen,
I need your assistance.</i>

O'Conner: So Jack,
what do you have for us?

First I found a cavity.

Something had been removed.

I was thinking a cyst
or a tumor.

Then I find its own ascending aorta,

vena cava, epicardium.

Apparently in working order.

Jack, we've seen the body.
We know the heart was removed.

Hearts.

Hearts?

As in plural?

So Bobby Allwyne had some kind
of birth defect?

Not a defect.

This is different.

If anything, it gave him
increased circulation.

A resistance to thrombosis or angina.

There is more.
I borrowed a densitometer from County

and ran a bone mineral content.

He's got a calcium index
10 times higher than normal.

Meaning?

<i>His bones are like concrete.</i>

He also has 30 percent more lymph nodes
than your average male,

an abnormally large spleen,

four extra molars,

a third frontal sinus,

and two organs...
I don't even know what they are.

Okay, Jacky.
I want you to do me a favor, pal.

Touch your nose
with your forefingers.

I haven't been drinking.

<i>Let me get this straight, Jack.
Bobby Allwyne...</i>

wasn't a freak of nature,

he was better than nature?

These anomalies are advances.

Advantages.

Evolution.

<i>I should have a report for you
by tomorrow noon.</i>

I just wanted
to give you some idea

of what
you stumbled onto.

Yeah, okay.

Um...

What the hell
have we stumbled onto?

There's some connection here,
Michael.

Bobby Allwyne's psychology,
his body, the killer.

Okay, so what are you saying?

That the Surgeon somehow knew

that Allwyne was some kind
of Ripley's freak?

Just because it sounds crazy
doesn't mean it's not true.

Okay, um...

This is fun and stuff but,
now can we call it a night?

Yeah. Let me stop by
and see Anthony first.

Smells good.

He ate his dinner.
Oh, good.

<i>- But I made carrots and peas.
Aahh!</i>

Never green and orange together,
Vicky.

<i>He has so many rules,
how can I remember them all?</i>

Yeah.

That's fit for King Arthur

and all the Knights of the Round Table,
Anthony.

Good work.

Still hungry, Anthony?

Want me to make you a sandwich?

You okay?

Are you afraid of something?

<i>I wish you could tell me
what it is.</i>

Why don't you just ask her?

Huh?

Carson,
for a drink or dinner.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

The thing is...

I'd probably miss kicking ass
and busting hunts together.

Maybe that's just the way
you two relate the best.

There's a depressing thought.

<i>- We're going to be late.
I figured as much.</i>

Let me guess. We're going
back to Allwyne's apartment?

Let's just say I want to spend
some quality time there.

Get in touch
with your inner psychic?

<i>Yeah, something like that.</i>

I'll drop you off?
Good night, Vicky.

Ahem!
Can I get a to-go cup?

Give me that.

Shoo!

Hey, you know,
I think the nanny's kind of into me.

Oh, really?
Why?

You can just tell
she digs cops.

<i>Helios:
How do you sleep?</i>

<i>Do you dream?</i>

Not often.

Sometimes I have a nightmare.

Pity.

Perhaps that can be rectified
in the future.

Patrick,

one of my people is having
a serious crisis of the mind.

I don't know who he is.

<i>- He's afraid to come to me.
Perhaps not afraid.</i>

Maybe he's ashamed.

Ashamed that he's failed you.

Search the city.

Spread the word
among my people.

Maybe they've seen
one of their kind behaving oddly.

<i>If he runs, kill him.</i>

Do you know...

how he can be killed?

I prefer to have him alive,

but at least I need his body...

to study.

Bring him to me
at the hands of mercy.

God bless you, Patrick.

That was a joke.

Hello?

Go on,
move into the light.

You're Detective O'Conner?

How did you get in here?

I go where I want.

In 200 years
I've learned a lot about locks.

The man who lived here
was in despair.

I recognize this man.

So you're telling me
you knew Bobby Allwyne?

He's like me,
not made of God.

Yeah, right.

He wanted to kill himself,
but couldn't take his own life.

We're not designed to.

Are you telling me
you helped him?

I can help you.

I'd recognize his killer
as plain as day.

Spread your arms.
On your knees.

I bow to no one.

I wasn't asking!

Will you shoot me in the heart?

You'll need two bullets.

What are you doing?

Showing you the truth.

Your real enemy is not the killer,

it's his maker.

And mine too.

I was created
with bodies salvaged

from a prison graveyard.
One heart from a thief.

One from a crazed killer.

Hands from a strangler.

<i>Eyes from an axe murderer.</i>

My life force
from a thunder storm.

This is your home, not your office.
That matters, right?

Carson, it's 3:00 A.M.

This is my home.
I need someone to talk to.

Unofficially, off-duty.

I'm your friend first, you know that.
What happened?

Have you ever seen a ghost?

You thought he might be a suspect
in the Allwyne case?

Yes.

What changed your mind?

Just a feeling, really.

And this man,
he did what?

I don't want to sound crazy,
especially to a police psychiatrist,

<i>but for the first time in my life</i>

I feel like I don't know
what I'm standing on.

Or what I'm supposed to think.

Just tell me what happened.

He took some bare wires.

It looked like
he was gonna electrocute himself.

Did he?

Not exactly.

But you thought

that he might hurt himself

or you?

Yes.

That's it?

Well,

<i>I think you were right
the first time.</i>

Say this man is a suspect.

Say he is the Surgeon himself

and you have him at gun point.

<i>The man you described,
enigmatic,</i>

<i>mysterious.</i>

You know,
like a ghost,

he's just suddenly there.

You think it was a trick.

How else
do you survive 120 volts?

<i>What happened after the fireworks?</i>

I lost track of him.

In other words,
he performed a little slight of hand.

He fooled you
and bought himself an escape route.

I saw what he wanted me to see.

Maybe what you
wanted to see too.

You know, we'd all like to know
there's an unknown.

A heaven,

<i>a tooth fairy,</i>

<i>a reliable man.</i>

Okay, partner. So, now do you
want to tell me why we're here?

Bobby Allwyne was in despair.

He wanted to die,
but he couldn't kill himself.

So you're buying
into Harker's theory?

Yeah, partly.

Allwyne kept hundreds of these,
all from different funerals.

What's that?

<i>Death appealed to him
and to the killer.</i>

Thinking he and the Surgeon
shared a similar psychology.

Based on what?

My inner psychic.

<i>Funeral Director:
I felt sorry for him.</i>

So many of his friends
were dying.

Then I realized he didn't even know
any of the deceased.

So what, he just gets his kicks
hanging around dead people?

He just seemed to get
some sort of solace being here.

Did you speak to him?
Just, "Good afternoon. "

"Sorry for your loss. "

I didn't let on that I knew
he had no business here.

<i>He seemed harmless.</i>

<i>Very respectful.</i>

Sometimes they were the only ones
here to send someone off.

They?

He had a friend who'd come
with him sometimes.

Can you, uh...

<i>- describe this friend?
Sure. Um...</i>

He was ordinary.

Average height.

<i>Average weight.</i>

<i>Middle-aged.</i>

And brown hair.
Maybe blond.

Good as a photo.

I've got a sharp eye for detail.

<i>I see that.</i>

<i>It's a gift.</i>

Sloane.

What?

When?

Okay, yeah.
No, I'll tell her.

That was Jack Rogers.
There was a fire at the morgue.

Allwyne's body?

Everything's gone.
Autopsy reports, photos.

Everything. They say it was electrical.
A short in a wire.

That's par for the course on this one.

Have you ever felt like you saw something
out of the corner of your eye,

and then when you looked
it was gone?

<i>I want to know what that was.
I need to know what it was.</i>

Carson, we're partners, okay?

If you don't tell me
what's going on inside your head,

how can I cover your back?
I want to tell you, Michael.

<i>I just don't know what to tell you,
you know?</i>

<i>I don't want you to think
I'm crazy.</i>

Too late.

<i>O'Conner:
Vicky,</i>

<i>how many times have I told you
to keep the door locked?</i>

What do you mean?
The door was wide open.

I locked it after you left,
like I always do.

You know
he could wander off.

Anthony,
you okay?

Did you go to the movies?
No.

Honey, was somebody here?

Keep your hands
where I can see them!

What were you doing
in my house?

From what I've seen
of how you live,

I think I can trust you.

<i>Your brother
is a heavy burden.</i>

You carry him with grace.

You are not in my life!

I mean no harm to you
or to your brother.

Your enemy is Victor Helios.

<i>You know the name.</i>

Made his money in medicine
or something.

He made me.

You see things
you can't explain,

and you tell yourself
not to believe your eyes.

Yet in your heart
you want them to be true.

Victor Helios made me.

<i>He made Bobby Allwyne
and the killer you're after.</i>

Victor Helios is some kind
of Frankenstein?

Frankenstein is a fiction
based on fact.

Victor Helios is that fact.

And he's 200 years old?

As am I.

I was his first.

How he's still alive,
I do not understand.

<i>He must be using his science
on himself.</i>

And what about you?

Perhaps the lightning, something
even more powerful than my maker,

gave me this blessing.

This curse.

Tell me about the Surgeon.

You said
you understood his pain.

He was friends
with Bobby Allwyne.

They shared a death wish.

He wants you to catch him.

He wants you to end his pain.

I'm not the monster anymore.

I'm your best hope.

This is where you really live.

<i>Helios:
What are you doing here?</i>

Is this where I was...

<i>born?</i>

<i>I don't remember.</i>

It was my gift to you.

But I have nightmares about it.

It's all a nightmare.

You don't really mean that.

You had such high hopes for me.

Such vision.

I failed you.

You haven't failed.

You have yet to fulfill
your potential.

No.

Victor.

Please...

let me go.

I don't suppose there's any point
in asking you

why you dragged me out of bed
in the middle of the night?

I got a tip on the Surgeon.

Wha... What tip?

Frye's pulling third shift.

<i>We need to ask a few questions.</i>

<i>O'Conner:
Frye.</i>

<i>We need your take
on the Allwyne murder.</i>

I don't care.

Ask Harker.
We wanna ask you.

I'm going home.

Detective, unless you want to find yourself
in the middle

of an I.A. Investigation,
answer my question.

Are you threatening me?

Yes!

The Allwyne murder,
what's your take on it?

I don't have a take on it.

The black rooms,
the razor blades,

what's your opinion?

What black rooms?

What razor blades?
What are you talking about?

This is...

difficult for me.

<i>I'm a creator,
not a destroyer.</i>

Yet...

because of your sacrifice,

there will be a better future.

A new humanity.

Perfected.

<i>Helios:
Have sanitation pick her up.</i>

She's in the main lab.

<i>All right,
what was that about?</i>

And try not to kill us both
before you tell me.

The Surgeon and Bobby Allwyne
share the same psychology, right?

Okay.
It's a death wish,

as well as an inability
to commit suicide.

An inability?

The Allwyne killing
wasn't a murder at all.

He asked his friend to kill him,
and now the Surgeon is asking us.

Asking us what?
To catch him, to kill him,

because he is incapable
of taking his own life.

What have you done with the real
Carson O'Conner?

It's sounds crazy,
but it makes sense.

Based on what?

I have a witness who understands
the way that they work.

You have a w...

What kind of informant understands
the inner workings

of a nut case with two hearts?
An informant with two hearts!

Okay, slow down.

And I don't mean the car.
There's no time!

I don't think the Surgeon will stop killing
until we catch him,

and I think I know who it is.

I like your singing.

It should be the blues.
Party sucked!

Harker: Oh, if only I could
be as happy as you.

Jenna:
That's cute.

Harker:
Are you locked out?

Jenna:
Again.

Harker: Why don't you come in
and I'll call the manager.

<i>Sloane:
What evidence have you got?</i>

I mean, Carson, you know
I trust your gut.

But if you're telling me
that Harker is the Surgeon,

then you have got to have proof.

Harker told me about
the black rooms, the razor blades.

I thought that he and Frye
had been there together,

but they hadn't.
Harker had been there as a friend.

He was Allwyne's funeral buddy.

All right, now say I buy that.

It's your next theory
I'm having a little trouble with.

Prominent local citizen, Victor Helios,
creates life in a laboratory?

It sounds crazy, but it makes sense!
How does any of this make sense?

What am I supposed to say, Carson?
Say you'll help me.

I want to thank you, Jenna.

For helping me understand.

<i>Sloane:
I've jumped off some cliffs before,</i>

but this one's pretty damn high.
Okay, why the fire power?

Remember Allwyne's body?

Two hearts, bones like cement.

Hard to kill, hard to arrest.

Michael, it makes sense.
Harker has been dogging us

about the Surgeon investigation
because he's the killer.

Okay, look. That might explain
some of his behavior,

but it doesn't make him
some kind of Frankenstein.

Frankenstein is the doctor,
Harker is the monster.

Right, I'm sorry.

Maybe I am crazy,
but Harker is our suspect.

He's armed.
He's very dangerous.

We go in there,
we break this case.

Then we jump off that cliff.

Ladies first?

O'Conner:
Harker!

Harker!

<i>Sloane:
What happened? What's going on?</i>

What the hell happened?

I don't know!

He was lying right here.
He...

All right.

So, um...
you're sure he went off the roof?

Yes.

And he, uh...

he hit the ground.

And he jumped up...

and ran away.
That's what happened.

And how are you gonna write this up
without landing in the psych ward?

I'm gonna lie.

Oh, that's a good call.

I should have seen this coming.

Don't beat yourself up.
None of us suspected him.

I'm responsible for officer evaluation
and counseling.

In fact, I had Harker in my office
less than a month ago.

I knew he was troubled.

Especially when he didn't show
for follow up.

No offense, Dr. Burke, but most cops
think mandatory counseling

is a waste of time, anyway.
Just because Harker didn't show

doesn't mean you should've suspected
he had hobbies.

How's the victim?
I'm going to go find that out.

This son of a bitch mostly
tore my thumbnail off.

Better than having
my guts cut out, right?

How long were you
Detective Harker's neighbor?

I moved in 11 months ago.

He was just a nice,
slightly older guy, across the hall.

Did you see a lot of him?

Once in a while he'd come over
for dinner,

or I'd go over to his place.

Son of a bitch could make
a mean lasagna, I'll give him that.

Did he have any other friends,
that he would talk about?

Sometimes I'd hear voices.

Like he had someone over,
talking into the night.

Mostly,
he was kind of alone.

I actually felt sorry for him.

Why did you feel sorry for him?

He used to say something
was missing in his life.

I told him, "Happiness is always
and option,

you just have to choose it. "

I told him he had to find his bliss.

I never thought his bliss would be
chopping people to pieces.

Police officer:
Okay, let me check my PDA here.

Look, if you're gonna rip me a new one,
don't bother.

I've done it already.

Apology accepted.

So you called Harker
after we spoke?

<i>Told him we were asking
about the Allwyne case?</i>

Yeah.

Any idea where he might be hiding?

Just goes to show how you can share
a squad car with a guy for years,

and not really get to know him.

I heard he made a mean lasagna.

Since this is your case,

let me show you what we found.

What?
Where Harker really lived.

According to the owner
this attic has been boarded up

since this place was converted.

Looks like Harker gained access

<i>through the crawl space
above his apartment.</i>

What did he use it for?

Well,
that's his "go nuts-room. "

Check this out.

Sloane:
Pick your poison.

O'Conner:
I pick that one.

That's tasty.
Pickles.

I'm guessing liver.

That's a good guess.
Good guess.

<i>That was...</i>

beautiful.

Accomplished.

I have a long way to go.

I'll arrange for training.

Your skills will improve

when you have proper guidance.

Ballet is about precision.

You need instruction.

What I enjoy
is following my instincts.

I don't think you brought me
into this world to be an automaton.

I brought you into this world...

to be my wife.

I thought so.

He lives here?

This is where I found him.
It's cozy.

Who the heck are you?

<i>Woman:
Oh.</i>

We're looking for someone.
A man with a scar and...

You mean Deucalion?

Just one name,
like Cher?

Do you know where he is?

Behind you.

Is he the one who failed?

Who let the killer escape?

That would be me.

I told you,
he wants you to catch him,

but his instinct is to survive.

We need to show you something.

<i>Father:
I've wondered if prayer</i>

might apply to us.

I've wondered if their God
might watch over and guide us

during times of crisis.

That's why I gave you sanctuary,
it was the right thing to do.

Morality...

means nothing to him.

Or to us.
I don't believe that.

If we live by a moral code.
If we live the right way,

there's a chance that we might
gain in spirit,

we might join humanity!

You'll never have
what they have.

He's made sure of that.

But...

I've defied him.

We've been denied the...

ability...

to reproduce.

<i>He saved that for himself.</i>

And I'm giving birth.

Take a look.

I'm giving birth to something.

That's not conception,
it's some kind of mutation.

It's an abomination.

Hey!

<i>I don't think you understand.</i>

<i>This belongs to me.
Go to him.</i>

This is mine.

Go and see him.
He'll know what to do.

<i>Stay here.</i>

Stay here.
I'll take care of it.

Father:
Sir, good afternoon.

Just good afternoon?
No, of course not. Come...

Why haven't I heard from you?

Well, I have been searching.

Searching for your man
in crisis.

Did you find him?

Sir!
Sir!

As a student of faith...

do you believe that God
can be deceived?

No, of course not!

Your parishioners...

do you think they lie
to their God?

They mean to keep the promises
they make, but...

they are weak.

Because they're human!

<i>Helios:
One reason why you were born...</i>

<i>to replace them.</i>

You shouldn't leave
your windows unlocked.

It's not safe.

Did you really believe
that God would protect you?

<i>O'Conner: Do you think he turned
to religion as some kind of solace?</i>

This was chosen
for another reason.

It held for him another meaning.

Oh, thank you.

You know, this place
was pretty well searched

Sacred Heart.

An ancient symbol

can mean many things.

What would it mean to Harker?

The power of passion.
Of love.

Renewal.
Resurrection. Hope.

He feels
something is missing in him.

He's trying to understand
what it is.

So he goes to the library,

he studies anatomy.

Compares himself to other people.

And what? Cuts them open
to get a better look?

I don't think these are random.
These are people he knew.

<i>Deucalion:
His victims are chosen carefully.</i>

<i>Specifically for their completeness.</i>

The first one was a school teacher.
The second one was a lawyer.

You'll find Harker
was well-known to both.

Someone Harker knew?

Someone he thought was complete?

I know who the next victim is.

Harker...

You don't want to answer.

Harker,
you are very ill.

<i>You need rest...</i>

you need some sleep.

You don't have any idea
what I need.

<i>- Yes I do.
Why would you say that?</i>

You're scared and confused.
It's time to stop.

I need what's inside of you.

You won't find what you're looking for
inside of me.

<i>- No?
No.</i>

I... I fear I...
Sit down.

I may have injured myself.

Harker, sit.

Okay.
Okay.

All right.

Look,

killing me is not gonna
help you find

what you need within you.

You wanna bet?

I'm not lying to you.

Stop, please!
I don't need what's inside of you.

It's not gonna do any good!
All lies!

I'm not!
Liar!

I'm not lying!

I'm not lying!
I'm not!

Ah! I'm not lying!

<i>O'Conner:
Kathleen!</i>

He's there.

Carson.

Michael!

Carson!
Take him out!

<i>Carson! Take him out!
Harker!</i>

Michael!

Are you a brother?

No.

Then what the hell are you?

His first.

I had them search everywhere

and there is no sign of whatever
you think came out of Harker.

So, uh...

where's our special friend,
Deucalion?

He seems to come and go
as he pleases.

I don't suppose he'd...

he'd like to give a statement?

You wouldn't believe it anyway.

You were here,

working all night?

Sometimes it's necessary.

There's much to do.

Well, the next time it becomes necessary,
call on me.

<i>I can help.</i>

<i>There's a phone call for you.</i>

I had it put through
to your private line.

Yes.

This Detective,
Carson O'Conner...

<i>Do we know who's helping her?</i>

<i>Vicky:
Rough day, or night, I should say?</i>

You have no idea.

How's Anthony?

Good.
Ate his breakfast.

He's in his room.

Is someone in there with him?

<i>No.</i>

Your brother sees deeply
into the true nature of things.

He's autistic.

Because he sees too much.

Yet, not enough to comprehend
what he sees.

Listen, uh...

Harker's body...

the evidence is gone.

<i>He was cremated
about an hour ago...</i>

<i>before there could be
an autopsy.</i>

They're calling it
a "clerical error. "

It's the hand of my maker.

He can't afford to have
his efforts exposed.

<i>- So what do we do now?
For 200 years,</i>

he has been preparing,

perfecting.
I, too.

Victor Helios
will destroy mankind

and populate the world
with his people.

His... creations.

<i>If you do not help me,</i>

he will succeed.

Leave it to blind fate.

Heads: You fight beside me.

Tails: I fight alone.

Screw fate.
