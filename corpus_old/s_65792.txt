Australia 1871

<i>- [Man Narrating]</i>
<i>I was the hero of Hughes Creek.</i>
[Bird Screeches]

<i>I can still see the glint in me da's eye</i>
<i>as he looked down at me...</i>

<i>his hand on me shoulder.</i>

<i>What did he call me that day?</i>
<i>Ah, what did Da call me?</i>

<i>That's right.</i>
<i>He called me Sunshine.</i>


You're a pretty girl.

You're Wild Wright's horse,
aren't ya?

I know whose ya are.
It's all right.

I'll look after ya.

<i>Handsome-looking horse you got there,</i>
<i>Ned. You're cuttin'a flash, all right.</i>


Ah, great.

You're Ned Kelly, aren't ya?
Red Kelly's boy?

Get down, Jane.

<i>- [Kids Chattering]</i>
Fine animal you got there.

Distinctive, wouldn't you say?
She's Wild Wright's.

<i>- That's the postmaster's mare.</i>
No, it isn't. It's Wild Wright's.

He lost her when
she bolted into the bushes.
You're a liar, Kelly.

No, I'm not.
I found her this morning, grazing.
She's been reported stolen.

Stolen, me arse!
A horse thief!

Get your hands off me!
<i>- You're under arrest.</i>


Stand, Kelly, or I swear to God,
I'll shoot you down.

<i>- I was only going after the horse.</i>
You were trying to escape.

You're just as thick as your bloody father.
<i>- [People Exclaiming]</i>

Jesus Christ! Now, what are you trying
to do? I could've tanned your hide for that.

Strike an officer,
and you'll bloody swing for it!
Strike you down to the ground!

No blows struck yet, Constable Hall!
<i>- Help me, someone!</i>

Help him! Help Constable Hall!
Poor Constable Hall!
[Shouting, Indistinct]

He's such a fuckin' rat!
He's trying to kill me,
the rascally blackguard!

<i>- Help me, someone!</i>
Stand put! Go on! Put me down!

He tried to shoot me, for Christ's sake!
All right! All right!


Is that the best you can do,
you bloody coward?

Go on. I can take it.

That's enough!

<i>- [Bell Tolling]</i>
<i>- [Door Unlatching]</i>

<i>[Door Latching]</i>

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Hello there! Please, can you help me?</i>

Hello! Hello there!
Please! Slow it down, please!

Come on! Come on!
Please!

Please, now! Oh, come on!
Give us a ride, you bastards!

Christ, it's muddy enough
to bog a dog.

So, where'd you go after Beechworth?
May Day Hills on a road gang.

Ah, you see Sean Gallagher?
I heard he was up there.

Yeah. I saw him
for a while.

Hey. I think that's old man Wicks and...
What's his daughter called?

Sarah.
Sarah. That's right. She's a picture.

Oh, we could be in love, boys.

Mr Wicks, good mornin'.

Mr Wicks, I don't know if you remember
me. I'm Aaron Sherritt, Mr Wicks.

If you could just hold up
for one moment...
If anyone can persuade...

an old man to share his daughter
with three larrikins like us, it'll be hard.

So how's me ma?

What?
Ah, the coppers have been
giving her a hard time, Ned.

Something goes missin',
a bullock or anything...

they come round the middle of the night,
tear the place apart,
scarin' the kiddies and all.

She's had it hard.
<i>- Come on, lads!</i>

Jump up!
Well, will you look at that.

What did I tell ya?

Thank you very much, sir.
Thanks a lot, Mr Wicks.

Thank you, Mr Wicks.

Dan!

[Dog Barking]
[Girl] Ma, there's someone coming.

[Baby Crying]

Oh, God. It's Ned.

<i>[Mother]</i>
<i>Neddy!</i>

<i>[Girl] Mommy,</i>
<i>I named Hobson's kookaburra.</i>

What did you name him, darlin'?
Beefy, 'cause he likes beef.

Well, that's a fine name
for a kookaburra, Grace.
Who's the proud father, Ma?

Don't even ask. He's a long time gone.
That's all there is to it.

The stinkin' Proddy.
He was a Yank.

George the baker.
We were married, Ned, right and proper.

Well, that's grand, Ma.
[Both Laughing]

<i>- [Dishes Clattering]</i>
Christ! Will you stop messin'?
I'm sick of the pair of ya.

Give your mother some respect, or I'll give
ya a hidin', both of youse, ya hear me?

And who are you, anyways?
Steve Hart.

Well, seein' as how the two of you
are so full of beans...

you can both get off your asses
and help me fix up this place.

You haven't done a minute's
work to help your ma, have you?
<i>- [Ma] Come on, everyone.</i>

<i>- Sit down, now.</i>
What kind of stew is it?

Wombat. A wombat's a marsupial,
and it lives in a hole.

<i>[Ma] I know, darlin;</i>
<i>I put one in the stew.</i>

[Baby Fussing]
Shh. Da-da-da. La-la-la.

Ned, would you like
to say the grace?

All right.

<i>Dear Lord, thank you for looking</i>
<i>after me mother...</i>

<i>me sister Grace, me sister Kate</i>
<i>and me brother Dan.</i>

Thank you, Lord, for
our beautiful baby Ellen...
Shh, shh, shh.

And for this wonderful stew
made out of wombat.

Amen.
[All] Amen.

Amen.

<i>[Ned Narrating] It's not easy for</i>
<i>an Irishman in Queen Victoria's colony...</i>

<i>to walk the straight</i>
<i>and narrow...</i>

<i>but I toed the line...</i>

<i>despite all temptations.</i>

<i>- With me fighting</i>
<i>with my fists for money.</i>
[All Cheering, Shouting]

<i>And after all, I did three years</i>
<i>for that stolen horse.</i>

<i>Wild Wright only got 18 months.</i>
<i>You think I was gonna let that one slide?</i>

[Onlookers Cheering]

[Gasping]
I declare Ned the winner!

[Cheering]
Bets are in.

<i>[Shouting,</i>
<i>Chattering Continue]</i>

So, are we square?

Course we are, you mad bugger.
Come here!

[Wild Wright]
Thank Christ for that!

<i>[Ned Narrating] Could it be possible that</i>
<i>the Kellys were finally getting ahead?</i>

<i>That I could actually</i>
<i>better meself?</i>

[Horse Whinnies]
<i>- [Woman] Steady.</i>

Excuse me.
You there.

Would you mind coming
and holding my horse's thing?
All right.

Steady.

Now, what thing
are you talkin' about, ma'am?
[Sighs]

Are you gonna help me
or not?

I've been riding him pretty hard
the last two days.

Poor thing's been
holding on since Saturday.
His bladder's paralyzed with the colic.

Good God.
Have you got that?

Right there. Good. Good.
Just hold it there.

Keep still.

I'm glad that's not me. Christ.
[Horse Nickering]

Steady.
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.

Okay. All right.

Watch your boots, boys! Whoo!

It looks like you've
done this kind of thing before.
Only on horses.

Thank God for that.

My name's Ned Kelly.
Pleased to meet ya.

Hello, Ned.
Right.

[Horse Whinnying]
[Man Shouting]


<i>- [Horse Whinnies]</i>
<i>- [Man] Watch out, lads! Here</i>
<i>he goes again! Clear the way!</i>


The horse is too wild.
It can't be broken.

A waste of damn money.
Fetch my rifle, please.

What? You can't
just shoot a horse 'cause it's wild.

<i>- [Man] What else can we do?</i>
<i>We can't keep it here.</i>
Why don't you set it free?

I could break that horse
for you if you like.

I've broken horses before. You can ask
around. I'd like to give it a try, at least.

We know there's not much point.
<i>- [Bullets Loading]</i>

The horse is bad.

[Men Speaking Cantonese]

[Speaking Cantonese]
You know, the Chinese say you should
have only one true love in your entire life...

otherwise you are no better than
a mangy dog or a loose woman.

[Speaking Cantonese]
What did he say?
Good thing I'm not Chinese.

[Speaking Cantonese]
What did he say?

He said what a lucky fellow I am to be
with such a beauty as you.

Too lucky, if you ask me.

Oh, hello, Kate.
I didn't see you there.

Fancy seeing you here.
I'm just having a swift pint after work.

It's not like I'm a regular or anything.
A man needs to relax
after a hard day's work.

What would you know
about a hard day's work?

Sleeping and drinking and beatin' up
yellow fellows is all you ever seem to do.

That's not fair, now.
I'm only doing me job.

I get along with everybody.
Everybody gets along with me.

Can I buy you a drink?
No, thank you. I have money.

I just wanna buy you a drink.
I said I don't want one.

You're startin'
to get on me nerves now.

Think you're too good for me?
Is that it?

Who do you think you are?
Let go of me bloody arm.
You're hurtin' me.

Let go of her arm, you.
I'm just bein' friendly, Ned.

Just offering
the young lady a drink.

She doesn't want one
from the likes of you.
A problem there, Fitzpatrick?

No. There's no problem here,
Constable.

I'm sorry if I upset you...
Kate.

Right.
This one's a request from Ned Kelly.

Right.
Follow me, lads. One, two.

<i>- **** [Fiddle]</i>
<i>- [Clapping To Beat]</i>

The nerve of the bloody knacker.
Look at him. Acts as if he owns the place.

Come here and dance
with your sister! Come on!

[Whooping]
That fella needs taking down
a peg or two, that's for sure.

<i>[Whooping]</i>


Ned, the horses are gone.
What?

<i>[Ned] The biggest thieves and liars</i>
<i>the sun ever shone on.</i>

<i>The Victorian police.</i>

Well, I'm telling you something
now, boys.

I'm not gonna let these bloody maggots
put one over on me.


[Mouthing Words]

<i>[Ned Narrating]</i>
<i>To change a horse's brand</i>
<i>is easy, easier than you'd think.</i>

<i>You just pluck the little hairs</i>
<i>and prick the skin with iodine.</i>

<i>A "C"or an "O"</i>
<i>can become a "Q. "</i>

<i>"Q"for "Quinn"...</i>
<i>me mother's maiden name.</i>

<i>[Silverware Clanking]</i>


Who's that at this hour
of the night?

Dan, is Kate in?
Yeah, she is.

Well, would you mind telling her I'd
like a word, please? In private, like.

No, I won't. She wants nothing
to do with you. You know that full well.

from her, if you don't mind.

Fitzpatrick, you've already heard that
from her many's the time.

Will you do yourself a favour.
Take a ride home.

You think you're so smart.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I've a warrant for you.
You've no warrant, you fool.

A Kelly stole them horses. I know it was,
and I have a warrant for you.

<i>Ned and all.</i>
<i>I've warrants for both of ya.</i>

I don't suppose
I could see them warrants, could I?

There's your warrants.
Hmm? There's your warrants.

<i>[Horse Whinnying]</i>

Oh, hello.

<i>I just came down</i>
<i>to find my riding jacket.</i>

I thought I left it
here somewhere.

I haven't seen it.

I was sure it was here.

If I find it, I'll be sure to bring it up
to the house for ya.

All right then.
Right.

You're from England?
Yes.

Surrey, actually.
You're Irish?

Yeah. Me da was from Tipperary, but I was
born here. I've never been to Ireland.

I came over when I was 17.

Richard acquired the land
through his family, and...

My da had to go to all the trouble of
stealing a sheep to get the trip over here.

He got a free fare then.
He was lucky.

Yeah.

How are you tonight?
Fine. Till you showed up.

Drink, boys?

Steve?
I don't drink with coppers.

Aye. There's no need for that.

So I'm leaving here tomorrow.
The work here for me is finished now.

Yes. I know.

So I won't
be seeing you any more.

You sure you don't want to have
a better look for that riding jacket?

No. I... I must have
left it in the house somewhere.

Well, it was nice
to have met you.

I really should go.

I think you're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

You don't have any warrants
at all, do you?
Oh, I do, Mrs Kelly. I do.

I don't believe this.
You just plain thick or what?

Come on, Kate.
I'm just having a bit of fun, you know.

Now, let's
see those bloody warrants.

I've split me head open!
You bastards!

<i>- It's your hand, you bloody idiot.</i>
Hey, Fitzpatrick.

Bottom rung on top now, huh?
<i>- Shoot him.</i>

Don't, Dan.
Give him back his bloody gun.

Go on! Get!

I'll be back for ya,
ya bastards.

Can you believe the brass neck
on that idiot?

Trying to be all friendly
with the grog.

Yeah. He seemed sobered up
when you pointed the gun at him.

See his face?
[Ma] I'm glad you think
this is all very funny.

Where have you been?
Never mind where I've been.

What's happened?
Fitzpatrick couldn't hold
his brandy and lemonade.

What are you talking about?
We had a fight with Fitzpatrick.

A fight? Why?
He said he had warrants for me and you.

What warrants?
<i>- Horse stealing, but there</i>
<i>was a load of shite in it.</i>

Whether it was or wasn't,
there's trouble now either way.
You can't take that seriously.

How can you stand there and act like this
is one big joke, after all the trouble...

<i>we've had with coppers</i>
<i>in this family?</i>

What are you thinking, Joe?
You and Dan oughta clear out
for a day or two...

just to be safe.

<i>God willing,</i>
<i>it'll all blow over.</i>

<i>- [Dog Barking, Distant]</i>
[Chattering, Distant]

What the hell
happened to you?

Ned Kelly shot me.
He what?

[Yells]
[Ma] Take your rotten hands
off me, you bastard!

Get off her!
<i>- You're under arrest!</i>
<i>I'm taking you to the cells!</i>

<i>[Ma] You filthy bastards!</i>

Ned! Ned!

Ned. Jesus, Ned, they've arrested Ma.
They what?

Yeah. They've taken her to the cells,
charged her with attempted murder.

<i>- [Ned] Attempted murder?</i>
And Fitzpatrick's saying
you took a shot at him.

I wasn't even there.
We know that, but it's your word
against his.

Take the word of a drunken liar
and arrest an innocent woman?

Is that right?

<i>I won't take this injustice!</i>
<i>I'm gonna kill him!</i>

I swear I'll scatter his blood
and brains like rain!

Ned! Ned! No!
Stand aside!

No, Ned! Don't make this worse for Ma!
Stop it, Ned!

Take the children inside, please.

What are you doing here?
They arrested me ma.

What for?
The copper says I tried to kill him.

Why?

'Cause he's a bastard liar,
like all coppers. That's why.

The thing is,
I wasn't even there.

I was here with you.

<i>You could tell the truth,</i>
<i>show the swine up</i>
<i>for the drunken liar he is.</i>

And then they'd have to release me ma.
That's impossible.

I couldn't. Do you realize
what that would mean?

Yes.

I can't. I'd be disgraced.

He'd take away my children, and...

It's all right. I understand.

Ned.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

Right.

<i>[Latches Clanking]</i>

<i>[Gunfire]</i>

<i>[Ned Narrating]</i>
<i>I made them an offer at the outset:</i>

<i>Charge me</i>
<i>and let me mother go.</i>

<i>The answer came back:</i>
<i>"We don't bargain with outlaws.</i>

<i>We'll catch you anyway. "</i>


<i>[Gunfire]</i>

<i>[Birds Screeching]</i>

<i>[Ned] You see those stretchers?</i>
<i>You know what they're for?</i>

The bastards ain't plannin'
on takin' prisoners, that's for sure.

There's another party down
past the neck of Bullock Creek.

Four of'em. They've hemmed us in
on either side, whether they know it or not.

<i>[Ned] We'll come back at dawn, hold up</i>
<i>these two, take their guns and horses.</i>

<i>At least then we'll have a chance of</i>
<i>making a run for it.</i>

<i>Right.</i>


[Gun Cocks]


Drop your arms!


Christ, it's Lonigan, Ned.

<i>You've killed Lonigan.</i>

Do you want marmalade, Ned?

Are you gonna kill me or what?

<i>I'll leave the force</i>
<i>first thing tomorrow morning.</i>
<i>I swear it on me mother's life.</i>

Ned.

Jesus Christ.
Do as I said, and no one will get shot.

Sergeant, you'd better surrender.
You're surrounded.

You been into the whisky again,
you old sod?

Get some toast on, Lonigan.
Lonigan's gone, and you two'll be next...

<i>- If you don't get off them damn horses.</i>
<i>- [Gunfire]</i>

[Horse Whinnying]

Oh, Christ!

Give it up, man! It's over!
[Gasping]

Will you stop running?
I won't shoot you. I swear.

[Yells]
<i>- [Birds Screech]</i>

[Officer Grunts, Coughs]

<i>[Spits]</i>

[Coughing]
Why didn't you surrender?
I wouldn't have shot ya.

I can't breathe!

No! I can't breathe!
Right, right, right.

Listen. It's okay.
[Crying]

I can't breathe.

One minute. One minute. One minute.
[Continues Choking, Coughing]

It's all right. It's all right.
Oh!

[Gasping, Choking]
Why did you have to run?
I wouldn't have shot ya.

God damn. Look. No.

I don't wanna die like this.
No. No. I'm sorry I shot you.

I don't wanna... I got a wife
and two children. [Crying]

<i>What are they gonna do without me?</i>
<i>What are they gonna do without...</i>

<i>- No!</i>
Look at me. Look at me.

God forgive me!
<i>- [Gunfire]</i>


God forgive me.


<i>[Ned Narrating]</i>
<i>I don't know why I took his watch.</i>

<i>It was something to do</i>
<i>with him not needing it.</i>

<i>[Thunderclap]</i>

<i>Later, I thought</i>
<i>about sending it to his family.</i>

<i>But by then, the papers had me down</i>
<i>as some sort of monster...</i>

<i>so I thought,</i>
<i>"No point now.</i>

<i>I'm damned anyway. "</i>

<i>[Door Unlatching]</i>

Is it true what they've been saying
about the three coppers?

Yeah, it's true.

Oh, God.

It was a fair fight, Ma.

Better them than Ned.

They'll kill him now.

They'll kill him for sure.

Don't shoot, lad.
I'm unarmed.

Come on. Put that away.
There aren't any troops.

Aw.
[Chuckling]

You're bloody chirpy
for this hour of the morning.
Gotta keep your voice down.

I've a visitor.
Who?

Mary Hegarty.
Mary Hegarty!

Mm.
Jesus. She can be only 13.

I'm not superstitious.
Well, well, well, well, well.

I've never met a man whose lies are worth
€2,000 before, especially not Irishmen.

It's €6,000.
Is that what it's up to?

<i>My cock alone's</i>
<i>worth more than that.</i>

I could do
with the money meself.

I'd build a shed out the back,
buy a few horses.

<i>In fact, I could buy half</i>
<i>of Beechworth with all that.</i>

That's very funny, Aaron.
Clause two.

[Clears Throat]
They've recalled parliament.

Passed something called
"The Felons Apprehension Act."

It means we're listed as outlaws.

We can be shot
on sight by anyone who chooses.

<i>[Ned Narrating] They said</i>
<i>I'd lost what it meant to be human.</i>

<i>Maybe I never had it</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

[Birds Screeching]
<i>- But wasn't this about</i>
<i>protecting the ones I loved...</i>

<i>the ones who gave me food and shelter,</i>
<i>even the clothes on me back.</i>

<i>And therefore,</i>
<i>wasn't it now a war?</i>

Dan, you see
that wooden gate?

Around the back there
is their living quarters.

If anyone's there,
you keep 'em there.

<i>[Children Laughing]</i>

[Clock Ticking]

[Bell Rings]
<i>- [Door Closes]</i>

Can I help you?
Yes, you can. Me name's Edward Kelly.

His mates call him Ned.
Ned Kelly?

I'm sure I've heard
that name somewhere bef...
I'm sure you have, sir.

<i>[Child Talking,</i>
<i>Indistinct]</i>

Stay where you are.

What do you think you're doing?
Who are you?

Going to a funeral, eh?
Better do as I say, or it'll be your own.

<i>- [Child] Ma.</i>
Shh.

Fanny Shaw, what are you doing here?
I work here.

I can't believe it.
What are you doing here, Steve?

We're robbing the bank. Me and Fanny
used to go to school together.

Steve. Hello, kiddies.

[Mouthing Words]

You're Ned Kelly.
That's right.

What are you going
to do with us?

You're coming with us to Faithfulls Creek.
We can't leave anyone behind...

to raise the alarm,
now, can we?

Mr Kelly, we are supposed
to be attending a funeral today.

As you can see,
I'm dressed in mourning wear.

Obviously unsuitable
for a woman travelling
in the countryside, hostage or not.

Even a blackguard like yourself...
Susan!

I do apologize
for my wife's behaviour.

There is no need
to apologize on my account, Charles.

The man is wearing a magenta cravat,
for God's sake.

I have an outfit
just arrived from Melbourne.

L'eau du Nil silk.

Well, you'd better
put it on then. Go on.


Joe, you should follow her, make sure
she doesn't signal from the windows
with her bloomers.

How dare you!
Sure. I'm doing no harm.

<i>What are these, these skulls?</i>

I collect them.
Hello.

So you're Joe Byrne?

The papers say you have the facial features
of a creature born to crime.

I'm the handsome one
in the bunch.

They also said you married
a Spanish housemaid in Diniliquin
with the exotic name of Madela.

We were just good friends.

Mm. I suppose
you have a lot of good friends.

I'm sure there's no harm
in being friendly.

No, I don't suppose
there is.

Oh, you're a beast...

an absolute beast.

She's taking an awfully long time.

He just fell off the other side
right into a puddle.

You'll never guess
who I ran into last week.
Who?

Danny O'Reilly. He's working
on the new rail line. He's got a wife
and three kids.

<i>[Steve] Sure. That's grand.</i>
<i>I haven't seen him in at least three years.</i>

<i>- That's like one kid every year.</i>
<i>- [Fanny Laughs]</i>

<i>[Dan]</i>
<i>Hey, Ned. Look at this.</i>

Mortgages.
One of'em's for old man Wick's place.

I recognize a couple of the others too.
They're of no use to you.

They're the only records
I have of the bank's debtors.
Can I have them back, please?

No.

<i>[Ned Narrating]</i>
<i>So I killed their policeman,</i>
<i>and I robbed their bank...</i>

<i>but burning their mortgages... well,</i>
<i>that was destroying Crown property.</i>

<i>It was like slappin'</i>
<i>Queen Victoria herself across the face.</i>

<i>So they send in Hare,</i>
<i>Superintendent Francis Hare...</i>

<i>late of Cape Town,</i>
<i>South Africa.</i>

<i>And wasn't this the challenge</i>
<i>of your whole life, Superintendent?</i>

<i>A feather in your cap.</i>
<i>You can't catch me.</i>

<i>You don't have a hope of catching me,</i>
<i>so you take my friends instead.</i>

<i>Over a hundred men arrested,</i>
<i>stuck in stinkin'cells without trial...</i>

<i>while their crops</i>
<i>perish in the fields.</i>


<i>And guess what. Not one of'em</i>
<i>caves in and tries to claim the reward...</i>

<i>not one of'em.</i>

<i>They loved mejust the same</i>
<i>and hated you all the more, didn't they?</i>

[Spits]
<i>- Did you really think I was</i>
<i>gonna let 'em all rot?</i>

Two and a half thousand pounds.
There's enough to pay rent
on the leaseholds for lads in jail.

Thomas, you can take what you need for
your mother to pay off her debt
to McTeague.

Thanks, Ned.
And there's some for McKinleys
and Bill Skilling...

whatever he needs
for his da.

Have you heard anything
about me ma?

They set a trial at the end of last month.
She's been given three years hard labour.

<i>I'm sorry, Ned.</i>

I say, give me that back.

That blackguard
just stole my watch.

They say the Lord helps those
who help themselves.
<i>- [Ned] Give him back his watch.</i>

What?
You heard what I said. I said,
give him back his damn watch.

Have you gone simple all of a sudden?
We're robbing the bank.

Listen here, kid. This is the last time
I tell ya... Give him back his damn watch.

You're not innocent men.
You're a bunch of common criminals.

Did you hear that? If we act
like common thieves, that's
just what they'll call us.


[Sniffs, Grunts]

My mother is rotting away
in a prison cell...

because of the lies
of a policeman named Fitzpatrick.

She's an innocent woman,
and so are these boys here.

My Irish brethren have been
unlawfully imprisoned...

and blacklisted
from their selections.

How do you expect me to behave other
than to stand up against this treatment?

[Exhales Strongly]

Any one of you here can take a shot
at me and not be charged for it.

There's me gun.

Any of you feeling brave enough,
go ahead.

No?

That's what I thought.

So if I can beg your patience,
this is my statement...

to the Premier of Victoria,
Graham Berry...

and you here
are my witnesses.

Joe, take out a pen and paper.
We'll write ourselves a letter.

Dear Sir...

<i>Dear Sir...</i>

"Dear Sir...

"I wish to acquaint you
with some of the occurrences...

This section here you might
find less amusing, Superintendent.

I give fair warning to all those
who have reason to fear me...

not to attempt
to reside in Victoria.

<i>[Ned Continues] Neglect this</i>

I do not wish to give this order full force

<i>Hey! Look! It's Ned Kelly.</i>

<i>- Look!</i>
Oh, my God.

It's Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne.

Can I get a kiss then?

Of course you can.

And a ladies' man, eh?

Where will you go, Ned?

The country belongs to us.

<i>- [Townspeople Affirm]</i>
And we'll go wherever we like.

<i>[Townspeople Cheering]</i>

<i>[Horse Whinnies]</i>

<i>[Keys Jingle]</i>


I hear you're planning
on getting married, starting a family.

Well, I'll tell you this, lad.

Lack of cooperation will
make it very hard for me...

to get you out of here
and back to that girl of yours.

I got nothing to tell you.

I don't need to tell you
about the reward out. It's a lot of money.

You could put it to good use.

You're a friend
of Joseph Byrne, aren't you?

<i>You've known each other</i>
<i>since childhood...</i>

served time together,
isn't that right?

Aaron,
it's the Kellys we want.

We don't care about Joe.

If we let this run its course...

he'll be shot down
like the others.

<i>The only chance</i>
<i>your friend will have...</i>

<i>depends on you.</i>

If you'll help me with this...

I'll guarantee his safety.

<i>[Men Shouting]</i>

<i>- [Insects Chirping]</i>
<i>- [Birds Squawking]</i>

Ned!

<i>[Birds Continue Squawking]</i>

<i>Jesus Christ. Come on.</i>

Let's go.

<i>[Men Chattering]</i>

Sir.


[Flies Buzzing]

They've poisoned it.

<i>[Ned Narrating]</i>
<i>Lying low, living in caves,</i>
<i>you get to learn sometimes.</i>

<i>Eventually, you can read soils</i>
<i>and rocks like books.</i>

<i>[Narration Continues]</i>
<i>I've watched gravel fade.</i>

<i>Dust settle into crust.</i>

<i>I've seen drips of water...</i>

<i>turn to stone</i>
<i>that defied gravity.</i>

<i>I've turned blood red</i>
<i>with cave mud.</i>

<i>- I've been a bloody rock.</i>
[Snorts]

<i>- [Slicing]</i>
<i>- [Whinnies]</i>

<i>[Horse Nickers]</i>

Aaah! Oh!
[Chuckles]

Sorry.

<i>[Speaks Cantonese]</i>
Wait... Please.

Can you help...

to scrub my back?

I can't reach.

Where's your husband?

Out looking for you,
like the rest of the country.

You took a risk
coming here.

Well, turn me in so.

You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done, Ned?
I don't know.

I suppose we're
all gonna find out one day.

Just thinking of Ma
rottin' away in that cell.


Where do you think Da is,
heaven or hell?

No. He wouldn't
be in hell, you know.

He wasn't
such a bad fella. He...

He was just a dumb paddy
who got picked on his whole life.

And that does something
to your pride, you know?

Can't even picture him.

When I was 10 and
they gave me that green-and-gold sash...

for saving that kid
from drowning...

that was the last time
I remember him.

He was proud of me that day.

We gonna be okay, Ned?

Of course we are,
you little gorn, you.

You're just
gonna keep running, aren't you?

They'll catch you eventually...

or shoot you down.

Did you know they pardoned
Frank Gardiner in New South Wales?

On condition
he left the colony.

He gave himself in.
He wasn't an Irishman.

Then why don't you
just leave the county now, try for
a new life somewhere in Queensland?

No. I can't.
It's not about me.

You know there's more to it
than that.

What would it take
to make you save yourself, Ned?

Hmm? My husband's best stallion?
Take it. It's yours. Forget the mares.

More than that. Much more.
What then?

The red one, too,
would be nice...

with you atop of it,
beside me.

For that you'd save yourself,
leave your friends behind?

And you your children.

Look. [Sighs]

You and me had no business
with one another in the first place, did we?

Wasn't that
the whole point of it?

Don't make me
grieve for you.

[Exhales Deeply]
I ain't dead yet.


<i>[Dog Whimpers, Barks]</i>

Rebel!

Kate. It's all right! It's us!
Oh... Oh, you bloody swine!

It's Ned. I know. Come here.
[Laughing]

[Gasps] Oh, my God.
Now, Gracie, look at you.

You've grown too much.
Give us a cuddle. Come on.


Rebel, come on.
Come on.

So...

I saw that rascal Aaron Sherritt
the other night.

Oh, yeah?
And what did you give him?

Nothing,
you little scoundrel.

Hmm.
The thing is, I saw him
talking to this fella...

all friendly like
on the way out.

Then the fella comes back here and starts
asking me all sorts of questions about you.

Such as?

When did I see you last
and where you were now...

that sorta thing.

Is he a copper, do you think?
I don't know.

Well, it could've
been nothing.

I just thought
you ought to know, like.

Thanks, Maggie.

<i>[Piddling]</i>

<i>[Dog Barking]</i>

Hello, Aaron.

Joe?

[Exhales Deeply]
Ned. [Laughs]

So how's things, Aaron?

Not so bad. Well...

not too bad.

I've been reading
a lot about you, Ned.

You're a real terror altogether,
aren't you?

We've been meaning
to talk to you, Aaron.

We were wondering if you'd consider
acting as a scout for us.

<i>We're heading into Beechworth</i>
<i>to rob a bank there.</i>

A scout? Well, I'm flattered
you'd think of me, lads, but, uh...

You're not interested?
No. I-I'd love to.

If it was just up to me, I'd be in there
like a shot. You know that.

But I've got the missus
to think about now.

Because between you and me, lads,
she's up the spout.
Ah, she isn't?

Ah, sure, that's grand.
Congratulations, Aaron.

Oh, thanks. Thanks.

How are Dan and Steve?
They're fine.

Say hello to them for me,
will you?

We will.
[Chuckles]

Well, I'd best
get back to the party.

Mary will be wondering
where I got to.

<i>Sure. You go on</i>
<i>and look after that girl of yours.</i>

Ahh.

<i>I will indeed.</i>

Sorry I can't help you out.
Good luck with it all anyways.

Aaron,
what are you doing?

Some coppers on horses
followed me until Wangaratta...

but I met up with Tom Lloyd and Bill
and we gave 'em the slip easy as you please.

That's good.
<i>- Here we go.</i>

<i>[Grunting]</i>

That's great, Katie.

Yeah, well, I wish
I'd never bloody bothered.
You're all gonna get yourselves killed.

We are not.
You bloody well are!

No, we're not, Katie. We're gonna give 'em
a show like they've never seen before.

<i>[Ned Narrating]</i>
<i>There's a certain type of black tribesman...</i>

[Trigger Clicks]

God, when is someone gonna
give me some proper cards.

Who's in?

Ugh. Fold.

I'm turning in.
I guess all that losin'
would make you tired.

You in or you out?
<i>- Gimme three.</i>

<i>- You?</i>
<i>- I'm out.</i>

<i>[Door Creaks]</i>

[Sighs]
What's happening?

Go back to sleep, love.

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Here. I call.</i>

Three to the English queen.

It's blessed you are, Nigel.
[Chuckles]

<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Aaron!</i>

<i>- [Woman] Aaron!</i>
Who's that?

<i>Who is it?</i>

Another one of your whores,
it looks like.

<i>Just tell her to get lost,</i>
<i>unless she wants her head blown off.</i>

Lizzie, is that you?

Joe.

Why do you think he did it?

Just for the money?

Maybe he started thinking
he was some kind of big shot...

<i>instead of</i>
<i>a shit-kicker's son, like us.</i>

[Hissing]
<i>- We have received word</i>
<i>that one of our informants...</i>

<i>has been shot dead</i>
<i>by the Kelly gang...</i>

<i>over near Beechworth.</i>

<i>We will entrain immediately</i>
<i>and proceed to Wangaratta.</i>

<i>From there, you'll be</i>
<i>split up into units...</i>

<i>and will fan out</i>
<i>across the country...</i>

<i>encircling</i>
<i>the immediate vicinity.</i>

Stay close
to your troop commanders...

for your orders of march.

[Horse Whinnies]
I would remind you all...

the men we are hunting
have not only plundered two banks...

kidnapped
men, women and children...

but have murdered
three of your fellow officers.

They have outrun us before,
gentlemen.

Do not allow them
to do so again.

Don't you worry, sir.
We'll show the bloody animals.

We'll blow 'em all
to kingdom come.

<i>- [Laughter]</i>
These are not animals, Constable.

These are men who have been glorified
as the leaders of a movement...

a movement that threatens the stability
of an entire country.

Underestimate them, and it will be you
who will be blown to kingdom come.

<i>[Ned Narrating]</i>
<i>They say the trouble with the Irish...</i>

<i>is that they rely</i>
<i>too much on dreams...</i>

<i>and not enough on gunpowder.</i>

<i>Whereas the English</i>
<i>were shy on dreams, as usual...</i>

<i>but had plenty of the other.</i>

<i>Now we had both.</i>

I suppose you're the Great Orlando.
That I am.

Well, I'm the Great Ned Kelly,
and this here is the Fabulous Joe Byrne.

We'd like to join your circus.

Ohh.

<i>[Animal Bleats]</i>

Mm.

<i>That's right. You're not</i>
<i>seeing things. It's a camel.</i>

I've got a lion and some ponies back down
the road. And the Great Orlando of course.

If you're here to rob the train,
you're too late.

We're not here
to rob the train.

[Lion Roars]

[Exotic Animal Noises]

<i>[Animal Noises Continue]</i>

Joe, get this lot inside.

This good-looking fella
over here is me brother, Dan Kelly.

These are my friends:

Joe Byrne
at the bar there...

<i>and Steve Hart</i>
<i>there in the back corner.</i>

And I'm Ned.

<i>We're all Irish boys</i>
<i>and selectors'sons.</i>

Had war declared on us...

by Victoria,
by New South Wales.

<i>By the crown.</i>

<i>And by the</i> London Times <i>even.</i>


<i>The reward on our heads is</i>
<i>the biggest one yet offered in the world.</i>

It's up to €8,000.

[Inhales Deeply]
It's a lot of money.

We're the only four lads
in the whole country...

the entire empire, in fact...

that any one of you fine citizens
is allowed to kill...

no questions asked.

No, it's true.
The queen said so herself.

That's right.
It's Regina versus us, the Kelly gang.

<i>[Ned Narrating]</i>
<i>So our plans were set.</i>

<i>One. The traitor,</i>
<i>Aaron Sherritt...</i>

<i>dead, as arranged.</i>

<i>Two.</i>

<i>The police special from Benalla</i>
<i>coming to meet us.</i>

<i>The line torn up</i>
<i>to send the train to hell, as arranged.</i>

<i>Three. Superintendent Hare,</i>
<i>if he lives...</i>

<i>easily worth</i>
<i>an outlaw's mother.</i>

<i>And four. The townspeople</i>
<i>out of harm's way...</i>

<i>drinks on us, as arranged.</i>

<i>**** [Fiddle]</i>

Here you go.
Oh, lamb! My favourite.

Ohh!
Ohh!

Now, cheer up there,
Mr Curnow.

<i>- You're witness to history.</i>

How many schoolteachers
dream of that?

<i>**** [Continues]</i>

<i>[Lion Growls]</i>

Come on, Hare.
Where the hell are you?


[Roars]
[Train Whistle Blows]

<i>[Knocking]</i>

Were you sleeping?

You thinking of using that?

I'm mulling it over.

Right.

You don't remember me,
do you?

You were just a boy then.

You were riding a Palomino mare
with a white blaze.

<i>[Ned]</i>
<i>Jane. Yeah.</i>

Yeah.

Seems like a long time ago,
doesn't it?

A lifetime.

Where's the other fella?

Where's Curnow?

Ned, Curnow's gone!

<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Give me a hand here!</i>

<i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>

Quickly!

Get those horses off!

[Inaudible Dialogue]

<i>[Metallic Scraping]</i>

Knights in shining armour.

<i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>

Curnow stopped the train.
Jesus.

What does this mean?
Hare's on his way.

You mean we didn't
get any of'em?

Not a soul.

There'll be a hundred
of them... at least.

<i>[Man Shouting Orders]</i>

You okay, Dan?

Yeah, I'm okay, Ned.

[Breathes Deeply]

Steve?

Short life,
but a merry one.

Joe?
We're gonna give them
a good old fight, aren't we?

Well, that's that then.

All right.
Everyone listen to me!

We're getting you
out of here!

<i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>

<i>[Man Shouting Orders]</i>


<i>[Ned]</i>
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

<i>We've got women</i>
<i>and children coming out.</i>

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>It's a trick!</i>


Stop your fire!
Cease fire!

[Screaming Continues]

<i>[Hare]</i>
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

Cease fire!

[Women Screaming]
Get down on the floor!

Keep your heads down!
Stay on the floor!

They fired at us!
They shot him!

Keep as low as you can,
you hear?

All right.
Let's give it to 'em.

Hit the lights.

Fire!


<i>[Screaming]</i>


They have armour
on their bodies!

<i>Aim for their arms</i>
<i>and legs!</i>

Ohhh! Ahhh.
<i>- He's been shot!</i>

<i>- They've shot Hare!</i>
[Ned] All right. Get back inside.

<i>Get back inside.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

<i>[Bullets Ricocheting]</i>

Oh! Dan,
reload me pistols!

I got the bastard
that shot me.

Give me that anyways. Rifle!


Bullets. Come on.

<i>[Bullets Continue Ricocheting]</i>

<i>[Women Screaming]</i>

[Shrieks]
Aw. The monkey's been shot!

<i>Poor little bugger!</i>

Ah, dear God.

Oh! Shit.

<i>- [Woman Yells]</i>
[Groans]

Somebody help me,
for Christ's sake!

<i>Keep low! Get around</i>
<i>the back of the bar!</i>


Can you find me something
to stop the bleeding?

<i>[Ned]</i>
<i>Get down!</i>

[Groans]
To hell with all you bastards!

<i>[Bullets Continue Ricocheting]</i>

[Groaning, Screaming]

<i>[Woman Sobbing]</i>

Ned! Where the hell
are you going?

Get this lot around the back.

Ned?

Now's your chance. Quickly!

<i>[Joe]</i>
<i>Out that back door there!</i>


Aaah!

Ohhh!

[Breathing Heavily]

Hands up, the lot of you,
or you'll be shot down like dogs!

Don't shoot!


I got him!
I got Dan Kelly!

No, you bloody well haven't.

<i>[Bullets Continue Ricocheting]</i>

Jesus Christ, lads.

I think I need a drink.

<i>[Ned Narrating]</i>
<i>I wore it seriously...</i>

<i>of green and gold.</i>

<i>Proof that</i>
<i>I've saved a life as well.</i>

I'm out of rounds.

Do you have any left?


Only two.

I guess that's
all we need then, isn't it?

We never stood a chance, did we?

<i>[Gunshot]</i>

No.

No.

Do you mind if I have this?

Ned!
Hey, Ned!

<i>Such is life.</i>

Despite petitions for a pardon that bore
a total of 32,000 signatures...

Ned Kelly was hanged
on 11 th of November, 1880.

He was 25 years old.
