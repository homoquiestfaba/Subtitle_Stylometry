You're going back and forth.

You never go back and forth
with a mop.

You go side to side to side.

Where did you learn to mop?

You filled out an application.

Didn't I ask you
when you took this job?

"I know how to mop.
Yes, I know how to mop."

But you don't. You don't.

This is how we mop at home.

Well, it's not how we mop here, lad.

It is not how we mop here, all right?

Yes, Mr. Crolick.

Side to side to side.

And not too much soap...
that's expensive.

<i>My life does not suck.</i>

<i>I've pictured this moment before.</i>

<i>Over and over again.</i>

<i>I saw it all very clear.</i>

<i>Today is the last day of summer.</i>

<i>I'll be committing some terrible acts.</i>

<i>You'll most likely
hear about me on the news.</i>

<i>You'll talk about me
and hear my actions.</i>

<i>Shocked, terrified, disgusted even.</i>

<i>But I won't feel sorry.
Not ever.</i>

<i>Today is the day that I strike back.</i>

<u><b><i>Extracted from DVD by
ForsakeN</u></b></i>

Thas what I thought.

Hello?

Hello? Excuse me.

Yup.

I'd like a room please.

Is that your rig out there
blocking the driveway?

I didn't park. I don't drive.

You don't drive?

No, I don't drive.
I don't have a car, man.

Anyway, uh, 34 is ready.
She's all cleaned out.

Thall be $59.64,
and I need your driver's license.

Shit!

No, no, no, my friend.

I'm telling you this is the best one
on the market for your money.

I don't know.

Looks kind of used.
Is it used?

Oh no, my friend. I took it
out of the box this morning.

That is why there's
some scratches on there.

Let me...

I can fix that for you.

I'm so careless.

Perfect! Like never happened.

And for you, I put in
a brand-new video memory card...

for free.

Free?

Free! Free, no charge.

You can have it.
Just don't try to take it out.

It... is a little bit stuck,
but it is not really a problem.

Stuck?
What do you mean, "stuck"?

Stuck-stuck, it won't come out.

But y-you don't need to take it out.

You stupid boy,
not too quick in the brain.

You cannot take it out,
but you don't need to take it out.

Is good to go.

You want to make movie, you need
the video memory card inside.

You make a movie.

Stop touching.
You want to buy, you buy.

Asshole.

Oh, yeah.

One size fits all, my ass!

Listen up, this is Joe.

I'm a soldier of my destiny.

I rule my destiny.

And my destiny is...

I'm Joe.

Listen up, you degenerates you.

This is Joe, and I'm the soldier
of my own destiny.

My destiny.

And... and I'm tired of you
degenerates telling me what to do.

You... you degenerates.

Today, I'm going to teach
the world a lesson.

Today, I rule my own destiny.

Today is the day
that Joe is going to show the world

what he is capable of, with this.

Fuck. Where's the...?

Goddamn...

On this historic day,
I will blow out your brain,

and the blood
will wash away your sins.

My life does not suck.

<i>How many more years
can I deny this?</i>

<i>It does fucking suck.</i>

<i>I am a failure. Thas what society
has labeled me to be.</i>

<i>A meaningless nothing.</i>

<i>A meaningless stain
smacked against the brick wall</i>

<i>we call society...</i>

<i>similar to these mustard stains
on the ceiling.</i>

<i>I think is mustard.</i>

<i>Anyway, it wasn't always bad.</i>

<i>Middle school was okay.</i>

<i>High school, thas when it got bad,
but I won't go into detaiI on that.</i>

<i>I never really went back to school.</i>

<i>Instead, I took matters
into my own hands.</i>

<i>After a few years
of various odd jobs,</i>

<i>I decided to get into business.</i>

<i>The retaiI business was going sour
after a rapid market decline.</i>

<i>Thas when I got into
my true passion... entertainment.</i>

<i>I struck up a partnership
with my first rapper</i>

<i>and got him on the right track
towards a record deal.</i>

<i>Thas Timmy, the rapper.</i>

<i>? Yeeeaaah?</i>

<i>? Back on a block
like a flock of birds?</i>

<i>? Ohhh?</i>

<i>? In the Ferrari,
gettin' away from the popos?</i>

<i>? Thas how I roll?</i>

<i>? Switchin' the speeds,
I change the lanes?</i>

<i>? Faster than the buses
and the airplanes?</i>

Yes, I killed that one.

Yeah. Word, my dawg.

Uh, hey, listen.
Uh, can we do it again?

Just maybe this time
just a little faster, al right?

Uh, yeah, word, yeah.

I just wanted that shit
to sound real clear.

Oh, yeah, it was...
it was clear, dawg.

Um, but let me just check
with my sound engineer.

Hey, engineer, was that clear?

Yo, Joey!

Joey, was that clear?

Uh, yeah, thas clear, yeah.

Hey, yeah, um, so it was clear.

So les take it one more time,

but this time, like I said,
les just do it a little faster.

I'm gonna make my peeps proud.

Okay. Um, good.

Uh, engineer, go!

Artist, go!

<i>? I'm gonna murder this track,
motherfucker!?</i>

I murdered that motherfucker beat.
I told you, man.

<i>The entertainment business</i>

<i>didn't welcome me with open arms,</i>

<i>so I had to get
into the food industry...</i>

<i>the bottom of the food chain,
so to speak.</i>

Gregory!

Gregory, how many times
do I have to tell you

when the toilet
is plugged up like that,

you have to get in there
and clean it thoroughly?

Do you read me?

You have to get in there
and clean out all the feces.

Every little bit of it... every kernel
of corn thas stuck to the rim.

Get the feces!

Yes, Mr. Crolick.

Don't Mr. Crolick me.
Get the feces!

<i>And it all went downhill from there.</i>

If you ever finish with that,
I need you to start on the ceilings.

I'm supposed to clean the ceilings?

I'm pretty sure I just said that.

Of course you're supposed
to clean the ceilings.

Look at them. They're filthy.

You are not the sharpest tool
on the workbench, are you, lad?

Whas going on in here, lad?

Uh, just a little clog, Mr. Crolick.
I'm on it.

Oh, clog? Well, come on,
we haven't got all month here.

Dig deeper.
Get some strength into it.

I'm trying, sir. There seems to be
something in there.

Oh, get... use your shoulder.
Come on.

Come on, get down in there.

Use your shoulder.
Get it all in there.

Thas it! There you go!

Thas how you clear a toilet.

<i>That wasn't the end of it.</i>

<i>One day Crolick did something
I'll never forget.</i>

Lad! Hey, lad!

Yes, Mr. Crolick?

Ah, everybody!
Everybody listen up!

I understand that today
is your birthday.

Yes, sir, it is.

Well, I got something for you.

Tada!

Go on, go on, open it.

Now you got a chance
to work your way up

to the Employee of the Month Board,
aye?

Well, go get the feces!

I think he really liked it.

I hope so. I can't take it back
once he's used it.

<i>That was it.
I had to do something.</i>

<i>After 20 minutes on the internet,
I located a couple of guys.</i>

<i>They were supposed to be
the real deal.</i>

I am Black Harry.

That is Yuri.

Yuli?

Yuri!

Hi, Yuri.

Are you Antonio?

Are you a police officer?

No.

Lift your top.

What?

Lift your top now!

Now drop your bottom.

What?

Bottoms down!

Okay. Okay.

Desert Eagle Magnum from Israel.

Is that an Uzi?

Fully auto, 9P.

Do you want to see
something bigger?

Yes.

All right, I'll take those four
and the machine gun.

Do you want the bullets?

The bullets don't come with it?

Well, how much are they?

How much do you have?

$137.

And 90 cents.

You can have the junior.

A junior...

...for a junior.

All right, I'll take it.

But I want the bullets.

<i>After a long discussion with myself,</i>

<i>my mind was set.</i>

<i>It was time to strike back.</i>

<i>I just couldn't let them
get away with it anymore.</i>

<i>No more laughing.</i>

<i>No more pushing me around.</i>

<i>No more of this.</i>

<i>This is my time.</i>

<i>My time to show them.</i>

<i>Fuck them all!</i>

<i>All of them.</i>

<i>I don't care. Fuck 'em!</i>

Happy birthday, kid!

Today is the day
I strike back.

Today is the day
that I make my mark.

Today is the day that you're all
gonna stop and ask, "Why"?

Yeah, Joey, is me.

Look, um, I need a quick favor,
all right?

No, Joey, I'm not at the arcade.

I need you to focus for just...
for just two seconds, okay?

Now, listen, I need you to get me
the mailing address

to CNN News, you got that?

CNN News.

Because I need it.

Because I do.

Look, Joey. Just get your ass
on the internet,

type in CNN, and call me back.

Hello?

All right, hold on.

And thas CNN?

Damn, what took you so long?

All right, fine, whatever. Thanks.

No, not today.

Because.

Just listen, Joey.

I may not be seeing you for a while
or something like that, and um...

And... and I just want you to know

that you've always
been there for me, and...

No!

No!

What... what part of "no"
makes you think

I wanna fuckin' go to Fun City
with you?

I'm never going to Fun City
with you ever a-fuckin'- gain!

You fuckin' retarded retard!

Hi.

Hello.

I'd like to send this.

You filled out
the wrong form there.

This is for international shipments.

Get one of those blue forms.

Actually, we are out
of those blue forms.

I'm gonna get you one.

Fill out this blue form here
and bring it back to me in a second.

Yeah, um, okay.

Um, I'm in kind of a hurry,
so I you can just take this,

and... and, uh, bend the rules
this one time, I'd appreciate it.

No can do, sorry.

Just fill out that form.

Uh, ill only take a minute.
Bring it back to me.

Okie-dokie?

Fucking coward.

Pardon?

I'm sorry, what?

Did you just call me a coward?
Huh?

A fucking coward?
Did you just do that?

Answer me, little man!

Did you just get the nerve
to call me a fucking coward?

Huh, you little penciI stick!
You little titty-licker!

Uh, can you give me the location
of a shipment service

within a 5-mile radius please?

You don't have one closer?

Coleslaw, Coke, 21.

Gregory!

What are you doing here?
I thought I fired you.

My favorite turd wrangler.

Here, I figured out
what sign you are...

Sagittarius with feces rising.

Did you want something?

He's on drugs or something.

Probably forgot his plunger.

You fuckin' pussy!
You fuckin' pussy coward!

Come on, come on.

Just pull the trigger.
Just pull it.

Look what they've done to you.

Just go out there and make it right.
Just pull the trigger.

Come on! Come on!

You're gonna do this.
You're gonna make it right.

Come on.

Where are my buns?

I want soft buns,
and I want them today.

No, I called you two weeks ago,

and the ones that you sent
were hard as rock.

I don't like hard buns.

I like soft buns,
and I need them now, all right?

No, I am not getting excited.

Now. Not tomorrow,
not next week, now. Thank you.

<i>Did she just look at me?</i>

Excuse me? Miss!

Miss, excuse me!

Hello?

Hi.

Hi. I'm not interested.

What do you mean
you're not interested?

Um, I just wanted...

I'm not interested.

Oh, hey, listen, I just...

I'm sorry.

I know this is weird,
but I saw you in there,

and you were looking at me,
and I looked at you,

so I just thought I would
just come out and say hello.

Can I help you?
Do you need something?

Why, do you have a boyfriend
or something?

Is that why you don't want
to talk to me?

Listen, hey,
is just like, you know...

Thas kind of rude.

Yeah, I am so happy
you called just now

because the skinniest,
tallest little man

is standing by me
and trying to talk to me.

I think he's trying to ask me out.

Thas not nice.

Thas not nice.
You're being rude.

I'm just... all I wanted to do is...

All right, thas enough now, okay?

I'm just trying to be nice to you.

You don't let people be nice to you.
I don't...

You know what?
All right.

No, listen.
You listen to me now.

Look at all these people
looking at you.

Nobody can see me.
Listen to me.

Listen... listen... listen to me.
Listen to me, listen to me.

All right. All I wanted was
to talk to you for two seconds,

and you can't even let me
talk to you for two seconds,

but you're going to
because I have this,

and we're gonna walk.

And if you try
to get away from me...

Okay, les walk.

Look at all these people
looking at you right now.

Hi.

Oh, you're right.
I'm doing this wrong.

Now.

We're walking
towards the restaurant.

Look how natural we look together.
We look good together.

We're gonna walk
past the restaurant,

and we're gonna talk for just
two minutes... just two minutes.

You can't talk to me for two minutes,
whas wrong with you?

How drunk are you?

Aah!

You just shut up, bitch.
You just shut up.

Don't you scream, or I'll shoot out
both your fucking eyeballs.

Okay, okay.

Goddamn it!

Just tell me.
Just fucking tell me.

Did you or did you not
give me a sign?

You did, right?
You gave me a sign!

Oh, you didn't! I knew you didn't!

Oh, I'm just a fucking idiot.

I always get this shit wrong
when it comes to girls.

I always fucking get...

Don't you move, bitch!
Don't you move!

See, I'm trying to be nice to you,

and you fuckin' wanna run away
and tell on me?

I had a fucking plan.
You fucked this up for me.

You're a fuckin' seducer,
thas what you are!

This is your fault!

I was just eating my fuckin' lunch,
and you looked at me first!

I didn't look at you!

Fuck! The fucking cops!
Did you call them?

I didn't call the cops.

You're right. You could...
you could not have called the cops.

Somebody called the cops, though,
didn't they?

This is what we're gonna do.

We're gonna walk. Is not very far.
We're gonna walk out of here.

Yes, we are.
We're gonna fuckin' walk,

and if you move or if you scream,
I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

Okay, les go.

I don't fucking give a shit
about shit.

Where are we going?
Don't talk, or I'll shoot you.

Eyes forward.

Don't make this hard on me.
I'm having a very bad day.

Sir, please just let me go.

I swear to God I'm not gonna tell
anybody anything about you.

I don't even know you.

Do I look like an idiot to you?

Stop looking so nervous.
You're so damn obvious.

Don't you move, or I'll shoot you.

The key doesn't work

Stop! Come back here!

You stabbed me, bitch!

Come on. Come here.

Don't make me shoot you, lady.

Please!

I'm sorry.

Okay. So walk.

And don't you fucking try to move.

Okay.

Please let me go.
I can't let you go.

Just let me go.
I can't. You'll tell on me.

No!

So you think this is the guy...
Gregory?

Well, I'm not actually saying that.

I'm actually implying
that it could be him.

I mean, those could be
his bullets there.

So you think that it might be him?

Right, yeah. Well, I...
thas what I'm implying.

I'm just... I'm not really saying it.
You know.

So, you're making an implication
but you're not actually saying it?

Yeah, yeah.

Well, you know
we can't make an arrest

solely on your implications, right?

Oh, man. I fuckin' blew it.

This is great.

Fuck.

Fuck!

Just when everything
was gonna happen,

I fuckin' blew it. I blew it.

Now a fuckin' hostage.

What the fuck am I gonna do
with a hostage?

Goddamn it.
What a fuckin' mess.

Fuck.

Do you think
this is gonna get infected?

Hello?

Time's up!

What?

Half a day is gone.
Pay up or be gone.

Oh, shit!
I only paid for half a day?

Oh, shit.

Hey, can I borrow 30 bucks?

Come on. Are you comin'?

Fuck.

Jesus Christ! How long are you
gonna make me stand out here?

Listen. I'm gonna go pay this man,
and if you scream...

Look, you got to pay
if you want to stay.

Thas the way that it works.

I don't make the rules.
I just got to pay the bills.

The only way I can pay the bills
is if you give me money.

So if you're staying, give me money.
If you're going, get the hell out.

So is there anything else
that you could tell us about him?

What was his position?

He was a...

You got to get one more out!

Part-time custodian.

And you fired him because...?

I fired him
because he couldn't do the toilets.

The toilet?
The toilets.

He truly didn't care
about his position.

I didn't have a choice in the matter.

So you let him go because
he couldn't clean the toilets?

Yes.

Thanks.

I'll pay you back, I promise.

This really isn't like me.

All this stuff...
especially with money.

I promise I will pay you back.
I don't like to borrow.

So please, what are you gonna do?

Listen, you know,
if you wanna rob the place,

I really don't care...
I swear to God.

You mean the restaurant?

Yeah, I swear to God,
I won't tell anyone.

Shit.

Why couldn't you just say hi to me?

Whas so hard
about saying hi to somebody?

I don't talk to strangers.
I'm sorry.

Well, I'm Joe.

And you are?

Linda.

Linda, what is that,
like a nickname or something?

What?

Yeah. On your license,
when I was paying that guy,

I saw in your license
it said Stephanie.

So, which one do you prefer?

Do you prefer Linda
or do you prefer Stephanie?

Stephanie is fine.

So why do you have
a license anyway?

I noticed you didn't have a car.

Is in the shop.
Is being repainted.

Yeah, mine, too.

Sir.

Joe, please just let me go, okay?

I have a 5-year-old son at home,
and he's alone,

and I have to go be with him.

Please.

You have a 5-year-old son?

Really?

Whas his name?

Brandon.

Brandon.

Why didn't you have any pictures
of him in your wallet?

What do you mean?

What the fuck do you take me for?

Do you think I'm a fuckin' idiot?

So I guess we're done.
Yeah.

Wait a minute. Hold...

Now, hang on, what about me?

What about you?

I could be in danger here.

I mean, who knows
what this kid is capable of.

Kids these days? Come on.

But we absolutely have no proof
that he dropped those bullets.

No threat, no motive,

so we can't officially charge anyone.

What are you implying?

No, we're saying it.
You know what?

I think you should just relax
and just go on with your day.

Try a little chamomile tea.

Okay.

<i>What am I doing?</i>

<i>Should I just run?</i>

<i>Yeah, I'm gonna just run.</i>

<i>What about her?</i>

<i>Who is she gonna tell?</i>

<i>Yeah, she'll tell.</i>

<i>Oh, pussy.</i>

No!

Miss?

Oh. Oh, shit.

<i>I've never hit a girl before.</i>

<i>Never really hit a dude either.</i>

<i>Now I hit a girl before a guy. Fuck.</i>

<i>Not a good way to start a relation...
or friendship.</i>

<i>No. I don't know.</i>

<i>What the hell do I call it?
An interaction?</i>

I brought you a snack.

What? No appetite?

Okay.

Excuse me.

Mr. Crolick.
Gosh!

Jason. Come on, kid.

Come here, come here, come here.
Over here, over here.

The bathrooms are cleaned, sir.
Are they?

Yeah.
Good.

You... you sure looked
like you're doing a good job.

Oh, well.

Listen. Hey, Jason, you seen...?

Have you seen anything suspicious
going on around here?

Well, in one of the toilets
I saw an unusually large...

No, no, not that, not that.

I mean, around here.

Here?
Yeah.

Never mind. Never mind.

Listen, you are a fine boy.

You really are.

I'm proud of you, lad.

You keep up the good work.
Okay, sir.

All right?
Yeah.

Take care.
Okay. All right.

Atatat, go this way, this way.

Right.
Okay.

Right you are.

Oh, Jesus.

Sorry.

Oh, you work at a hospital.

What are you? A doctor?

Listen, I'm really sorry
about hitting you.

But what else
was I supposed to do?

I mean, you're coming at me
with a knife.

Please take this off.

What?

Let me go.

Are you gonna rape me?

What?

No. I'm not gonna rape you.
I'm not a sicko.

Joe, I really don't care what you do.

I really don't care
if you rob that place.

I promise I'm not gonna tell anyone.

Joe, I give you my word, okay?

I swear to God
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

Honestly, I don't even know
what you look like.

Yeah. I suppose I have one
of those unrememberable faces.

Thas not what I meant.

People don't get me, you know.

When I was 7 years old,
I thought that I would own the world,

you know what I mean?

I mean not really, not literally,

but I really thought
I was on to something big.

But I wasn't.

Red Star Buffet.

That sounds nice.
Is it fancy?

Oh, looks like I'm not
the only criminal in the house.

Whip it up with miracle mix.

I did.

More miracle mix, please.

Mr. Crolick, I already made
a whole batch.

Don't "Mr. Crolick" me.
Just do as I say.

More miracle mix.

People, listen up.

My meat will not be taken for granted
in this kitchen.

When we're dealing with my meat,
we always use an extender.

This is good.
This is really good.

I don't really smoke that much.

Me neither.

It calms me down.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Well, it easily makes me paranoid.

Really?

No, not really.

But seriously,
can I ask you something?

Why didn't you talk to me
when I approached you earlier?

You... you can tell me the truth.
I won't get mad, I promise.

You know, honestly, it has
nothing to do with you. Is me.

No, don't say that. Come on.

I don't know.
Maybe is your voice.

My voice?

The way you were talking.
It was kind of weird at first.

I think I smelled something.

Was it me?

I don't smell anything.

Can I ask you something?

Why'd you decide to approach me?

I told you,
I thought we had a moment,

you know, the way
we looked at each other.

I was just trying to be spontaneous.

I'll never do that again.

Do you hear that?

Where is that coming from?

From the tub, I think.

You're gonna break it.

I don't care. This isn't my house.

Shit!

Shit, thas big!

Ken, working hard, I see.

Chopping onions.

Chop, chop.

Really slowly.

Hey listen, Ken, have you, uh...

have you seen anything
out of the ordinary here lately?

I don't know.

No, I mean, anything
out of the normal, les say.

I don't know.

Have you seen Gregory today?

Not today. I saw him yesterday,
but I didn't see him today.

Right.

You're happy working here,
aren't you?

I mean you're a happy worker, right?

Is okay.

Not disgruntled in the least?

Yeah.

I like... I like working here, too.

Great job. Great, great job.
Good benefits.

All right. Well, listen,
is been great rappin' with you,

and, uh, you carry on, okay?

Catch you on the flip-flop.

I'm just one of the guys.

Right. Carry on.

<i>Say something cool.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Nah, wait.</i>

<i>Just be natural.</i>

<i>You don't have to think at all.</i>

<i>Just don't try so hard.
Just be smooth.</i>

<i>Oh, no. Let her talk.
She'll think of something.</i>

<i>Nah.</i>

<i>Think of something cool.</i>

I...

I always felt bad for the lobsters.

You know the lobsters in those
big glass sinks in the supermarket?

They're just in there
piled on top of each other.

This one time, me and Joey,
my friend,

we got obliterated,
and we went down there,

and we were staring at them,

and I kept thinking, "I wonder
what they're thinking," you know?

I mean, they're in there,

and they can see us
through those glass walls,

and we must look
like giants to them.

Then they're just there
and just hanging out,

waiting for their turn
to go into the pot.

What a life.

Man.

Hey, Joe.

Yeah?

What are you gonna do?

I don't know.

What are you gonna do with me?

I don't know.

We could talk.

Do you wanna just talk?

I'm so tired.

I'm just really, really tired.

Of everything, you know.

I'm just so tired.

I wrote a book once.

You did?

Yeah.

Thas cool.
What was it about?

Well, is a novel,

and, um, the main character...
he, um... he has this dream

of building the worlïs
tallest building, this tower,

only he has all this opposition.

Everybody's trying
to mess up his plans,

and he doesn't know
who his enemies are.

But he also doesn't know
who his friends are either

because people keep
shifting identities, and...

Well, it had some
sci-fi elements to it.

Thas cool.

Yeah.

Whad you do with it?

I sent it to a few publishers.

What did they say?

They sent me back letters.

It said something like, um,
they couldn't read it

because it was unsolicited material
or some shit like that,

whatever the fuck
thas supposed to mean.

Fucking cowards.
I hate fucking cowards.

Like, Mr. Crolick, for instance.

Who's that?

He's my boss at that burger joint.

Get the feces!

Like, he made me stick my arms
up to my elbows in toilet bowls.

He's fucking sick.

Did you quit?

Almost.

On the day I decided to quit,
he fired me.

Damn it, Gregory,
I've had it right up to here with you.

Right up to here.

You were the worst employee
I have ever had,

and you're out of here.

You hear me? Gone.

Ah, he's the king of assholes.

This one time
he put up a picture of me

right up next
to the Employee of the Month

with a big sign underneath
that read,

"Gregory Wilks,
a lazy, incompetent employee."'

He wanted to make an example
out of me or something.

Out of me, like, for what?
What did I ever do to him?

Did you just say Gregory Wilks?

Yeah. Gregory fucking Wilks.

Joe's my nickname.

Well, not really.
I just call myself that.

I like how it sounds.

Did you go to Stevenson High?

I don't really like to talk
about high school.

I went to Stevenson High.

<i>So, wait, are you, like,
the Gregory Wilks?</i>

Yeah, why?

Oh, my God.

You're the guy that got caught
jerking off in study hall.

I've heard that story, like,
a million times. You're a legend.

Can you just do me a favor?

Can you just humor me
for a second,

and can you just tell me
your version of this, please?

So many facts about that story
have gotten twisted around.

Yeah.

I mean, I barely even got started.

All right.

No, no, listen to me.
Okay.

I was... it was a study hall,

and everybody was
on a field trip that day.

I was alone. I was all by myself,
and I barely even...

And well, no, listen.

And later I found out that there was
a hidden camera in that classroom.

I have a solid case against it.

Gregory, I'm sorry.
Cut it out.

Is not funny, you're right.
Shut up.

Is really fucking funny.

Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

I could shoot you in the face!

Do you know how fucking
embarrassing that was for me?

My parents thought I was a freak.

The school played them
the video tape

as if me admitting to it
wasn't enough.

They said I needed therapy.

Therapy? For what?

Fuck therapy, and fuck you,

and fuck all of this,
and fuck my... fuck!

Oh, goddamnit!

God!

Oh, fuck!

Fuck!

Can I see it?

No! Get away from me!

Let me see it.
I'm a nurse's aide. Come on.

I broke it. I fuckin' know I did.
I fuckin' broke it.

Hey, where are you goin'?

Oh, God!

Come here.

Put it in there.

Just let it cool for a second.

Oh, God.

I broke it. I know I fuckin' broke it.
I know I did.

Does this hurt?

Yes!

Okay.

Hello?

Yeah. Yeah, Ma.

No.

No, Ma, I don't know.

No. No, I won't be home for dinner.

Because I won't.

Yes, I have my key. Yes.

I can handle it, all right?

Sorry.

You live at home?

Yeah.

Like, with your whole family,

like, your mom and your dad
and everyone?

My dad, my mom, my sister,
my older brother, our dog Steve.

Is really embarrassing, right?

Is kind of cool actually.
I'm a little jealous.

I wish I lived with my parents,
you know.

My dad left, like, pretty soon
after I was born,

so I don't really know him.

So it was just me and my mom,
you know.

So my mom was, like,
my best friend, you know.

Is just me and her.

And then, um,
when I was 14, she died, so...

And then I lived with my aunt,
and I finished high school there.

She, um... we didn't get along.

So you're kind of lucky,
just so you know.

What did she die of?

She had cancer.

I'm sorry.
Is none of my business.

Is fine.

How is it with your family?

All right, I guess.

Do they know
that you run around with a gun

trying to rob a fast food restaurant?

No. They wouldn't think
I had the balls to do that

in a million years.

They think I'm just... mediocre.

I mean, I always wanted
to do something.

You know, something to show them

that I'm man enough to actually
do something with my life.

That I'm not...

that I'm not worthless.

Yeah, thas the word
I was looking for... worthless.

I just... I just don't want them
to think that I'm a pussy.

I think they think
I'm stupid or something.

I don't think they think that.

No, I mean,
I did try to do something.

I really, really did.

I mean, sometimes good stuff
just doesn't happen to people.

I mean, maybe if I had a little luck,
but I didn't,

and... and so things just didn't
work out like I planned.

Why don't you write another book?

Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, thas funny.

Don't make me laugh.

No, I'm serious.

I mean, do you think your parents
will love you more

if you become a career criminal
and get shot?

At least they'll know
I'm not a coward.

Can I see your hand?

Ow. Can you help me?

Well, I tied you up good.

Let me see.

Shit!

You don't dick with the Crolick.

Are you talking to me?

You must be talking to me,
'cause I'm the only Crolick here.

Are you talking to me?

Yeah, watch yourself.

You want piece of me?
You want a piece of me?

Would you like
several pieces of me?

Yeah. Yeah, mister!

Take that. Yeah!

I almost had a heart attack
when you came to me with that knife.

Which time?

The second time.
The first one, I didn't see coming.

Well, what did you expect?

I thought you're, like,
the hitcher or something.

The hitcher?
Uh-huh.

You're the one who almost took
my head off with that machete.

You're the one who kidnaps me.

Yeah? Well, you're the one
who couldn't even say hello to me.

You looked creepy.
I thought we had a moment.

You put a gun in my hip.

Yeah. I was going
through a rough patch.

You were under a lot of pressure.

Plus, I probably stank.

Is that a mustard stain?

It could be.

Somebody should really clean
the ceilings in these places.

How do you clean a ceiling?

Thas what I'm trying to figure out.

Oh, shit!

I never a minute of peace.

Enter!

Mr. Crolick.

We had a little malfunction
in the bathrooms,

but I took care of it, sir.

There's no problemo.

Yeah, well, I used my best instincts
just like you instructed me, sir.

Very good, lad.
Very, very good, Jason.

So, what you doin', sir?

I'm making a shank.

I'm reading the... the paper.
Thas all.

Well, if you, uh,
check the lavatory, sir,

check them for leaks.

You know, leaks.
Little bathroom humor.

Sorry.

Good. Is good. Thas a good one.

No, you know what, I'm gonna
do that later. Thank you, Jason.

Very well, sir.

Great.

Go away, Jason.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Sorry. All right. See you.

Good grief!

Stool.

You know what I hate?
What?

The guys who are on MTV
who are always bragging

about their cribs
and their hoes and their grills.

I don't understand
little ketchup packs.

Why did they make them so small?

You have to use 20 ketchup packs
just to eat a thing of French fries.

Is a waste. Is a waste of plastic.
I'm just saying.

Oh, you know what I don't get?
What?

Dudes with ponytails.

You know what I don't get?

Soft-core porn.

You know, is like two hours
of a bad story

mixed in with 15 minutes
of fake sex and bad acting.

Why do you have a camera?

Can I see it?

Yeah, go ahead.

I mean, there's no tape in it.

You know what I don't get?

Laid.

<i>This is Joe.
Thas a good one.</i>

<i>Today, I'm the ruler of my destiny.</i>

<i>Today, I make justice my way.</i>

<i>With this, I'll make your blood spill,</i>

<i>and you'll forever remember
what you have all done to me.</i>

Give me that!

<i>- This is Joe.
Fuck!</i>

<i>This is Joe. This is Joe.</i>

Oh, fuck!

Fucking memory card.

You weren't gonna rob the place,
were you?

I was watching this show
on the Discovery Channel

about taboos.

On the Taiwanese food market,
you can buy stuff

like pig brains and, like,
dog testicles and snakes and stuff.

Yeah, I think I saw it.

Is pretty creepy, huh?

Yeah.

Yeah. Kind of like me.

I don't know what to do.

I just feel all this pressure.

I remember when my mom died.

I remember sitting in a bathtub
filled with water...

...holding the plugged-in hairdryer
over the water.

I was holding it by the wire.

Just holding it.

I don't know what I was thinking.

The weird thing is
it wasn't even about my mom.

I just kind of wanted everything
to just stop, you know.

Just... just be quiet for a second.

You know what I mean?

I know the feeling.

I'm sorry.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

<i>? Another lazy afternoon?</i>

<i>? I know you think is time for me
to do some moving?</i>

<i>? But is hard to get started
and dust my broom?</i>

<i>? My broom has passed by
for several times now?</i>

<i>? This day is just one out of many?</i>

<i>? You know I am lazy
so stop telling me so?</i>

Is nice out tonight.

Is the last day of summer.

Yeah. But we still have fall.

So how's your...?

It should be gone by next Friday.

How's your...?

Um, is all right, I guess.

Doesn't hurt anymore.

Good.

Yeah.

So, how about dinner sometime?

Maybe tomorrow?

Yeah, I know.

Well, I've got to get rid of this,
so...

Stephanie.

<i>? Oh, I can live without?</i>

<i>? I can live without a thought?</i>

<i>? Of going home?</i>

<i>? Oh, I can see it hurts?</i>

<i>? I can see whatever is in there?</i>

<i>? I can change my clothes?</i>

<i>? I can change my everything?</i>

<i>? To make your mind speak?</i>

<i>? I wish you were right here?</i>

<i>? I wish you were
just every day with me?</i>

<i>? Here I go?</i>

<i>? On my own?</i>

<i>? Well, thas better than waiting?</i>

<i>? Here I go?</i>

<i>? On my own?</i>

<i>? Must be better than waiting?</i>

<i>? I could hold your hand?</i>

<i>? I could hold your hand real tight?</i>

Gregory.

Crolick.

How are you, pal?

What are you...?

What are you doin'
around these parts?

Hey, would you like a late dinner?

I think we have some leftovers.

Meatloaf, I think.

Listen, uh, I always thought
that you were a great employee.

But, you know, there... there's
always room for creative criticism.

Creative criticism.

Yeah. Well is, you know...

Is an important part
of being a boss.

You made me dive
into a fucking toilet bowl.

Yeah, well, these are decisions
that I have to live with.

Would you, uh...
would you like your old job back?

My job back?

Yeah, uh, um, dishwasher.

I could upgrade you to dishwasher
or potato peeler. Thas even better.

Anything higher than that,
we got to retrain you...

Shut up.
Okay.

Hey, Crolick,
how are your toilet bowls now?

They're fine. They're very good.
We have a new lad.

Oh, God.

Do you want to make a move
on me now, huh?

No.

Do you want to order me
around now?

No, I don't.

Yeah, thas right.

You can't make me do shit.

You got that?

I hate you, Crolick.

I hate you
because you're an asshole.

And I'm not gonna fuck up my life
over you, lad.

Gregory, listen. L...

My name is Joe.
Of course.

I hate the name Gregory.
I always have. Is fuckin' stupid.

I agree. Thas a stupid name.

I'm Joe.

And you can go flush yourself.

No.

You know what, Crolick?

You're not the problem, man.

You might be the biggest asshole
in the world,

but you're not my problem.

Nice work, Crolick.

Pussy.

Shit.

<i>? A sucker punch could land him
to his knees?</i>

<i>? So count two, three, four?</i>

<i>? Count two, three, four?</i>

<i>? Amy had her friends
and her sweet, sweet delinquents?</i>

<i>? To help her fall away from you?</i>

<i>? A six string is waiting for you?</i>

<i>? To steal the moment
and blaze your entry?</i>

<i>My name is Gregory a.k.a. Joe.</i>

<i>My life doesn't not suck.</i>

<i>? Count two, three, four?</i>

<i>? Count two, three, four?</i>

<i>? Count two, three, four?</i>

<i>? Count two, three, four?</i>

<i>? Wrap the silver question
around your head?</i>
