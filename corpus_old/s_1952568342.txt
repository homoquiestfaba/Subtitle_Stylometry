We interrupt
to announce that a dancing bear...

...has wandered away
from the carnival.

He is a trained bear
and will dance if he hears music.

Do not be alarmed, he is harmless.

Contact your local police.

A big reward will be paid
for the return of the dancing bear.

Your attention, please.

We interrupt this program...

...to announce that the reward for
the missing bear has been doubled.

If you see this missing bear...
