You do well?

Yo

You ready to meet mama?

Look at me!

I don't bring just anyone to meet mama.

And you said you were ready to become one of us

I'm a Believer

Come in.

Cassidy made a good haul tonight, Mama.

The community appreciates all the

good work we do here.

Heh. Sure love the way they show their appreciation.

I'm sure Chief Check will appreciate it also.

Cassidy.

I heard about you.

Have you ever had your fortune read?

Well, you will enjoy it.

Yes Mama.

Well, I can see here

Nice things.

Money...

Toys.

Hmm. But...

You are

lonely though.

Sad. Despair.

Ahh.

But it seems you have found your true calling.

So.

Let's officially make you

part of the church.

No need to be nervous, my child.

(Snaps fingers)

Is this... is this zombie powder, Mama?

Such colorful names they give to my

sacred blessings.

I'm sorry, Mama.

Now...

Take the cup in your hand

And just relax.

Come on, Cassidy.

You said you wanted to.

Shh!

Maybe he's not ready yet to receive my offers.

No! No, Mama. I'm ready.

Now... Cassidy

Look.

Deeply into my eyes.


(Voodoo noises)

Papa... Legba.

Up boy!

Now.

Cassidy, Everyone...  follow me

(Match striking)

Do you remember what I told you all

when we first started this?

I told you all

that we must be ready

to defend our faith

against the non-believers.

Well, now...

that time has come.

Cassidy!

You have brought sin into our sacred house.

No!

I don't...

Do not lie, boy.

It is time for your penance.

(Voodoo drumming)

(Bongo breakdown)

(Voodoo chanting)

You must cleanse this church.

You must cleanse it of all sin

before you can enter my kingdom.

You will soon, my son.

You will soon.

Hi. We're here to learn more

about the church

I don't think this is your kind of church.

Oh, you be surprised... um.

My family's actually from the West Indies,

from St Lucia.

And, uh...

You know, I grew up in a church like this.

Your family practices voodoo?

We did... Back on the island.

But, uh...

You know, we haven't been able to find a church here to practice...

So, when I heard about this one?

Thought I'd bring my wife and check it out.

Well, go on in.

Mama welcomes everyone.

(Door closes)

So you were part of a

church like this in St. Lucia?

Thought you were Puerto Rican?

Of course not.

But we have churches just like this in Puerto Rico.

Well I should know this stuff

about my husband after all.


Hello.

I didn't see you there.

You have such pretty eyes.

Uh... I'm James and this is Patricia.

I'm Sammie.

Ok... uh, well.. you may know

a friend of mine then.

He's a member here.

You see? It's perfect.

You must have it and only ten dollars.

Can you help me out? Anything?

I don't know.

How about five dollars?

Shoot. If it's for the church? Why not?

Do you know where Mama is now?

Down those stairs.

Thank you.

Oh. Hey! And, uh...

Keep up the good work you do around here.


Yeah, let's just hope we

finally meet this Mama.

Make some progress.

Is this Mama's room?

It sure is.


Hello, anyone there ?

We're looking for the high priestess...?

Mama... Dominique DeSilva?

Come in.

You're here for a reading, my darlings?

No. Actually, my wife and I would

like to join the church.

When I was young, my family...

My family went to one in St. Lucia.

So...

James.

Have you ever had the kanzo performed

any time in your life?

Yeah, yeah. I think so...

I'd have to ask my mother but

Yeah! Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

Pretty sure.

How did you hear about us?

My... my brother.

My brother was actually a member here

You may know him.

He does not look familiar.

Do you mind taking a closer look at that?

I am sure he is not part of our flock.

Funny... because

He mentioned this here church,

and you by name.

We welcome you into our sacred house

with open arms.

And you return our acceptance by

bearing false witness against this church?

I ask you now,

to leave. Immediately.

Look.

If we can't find him, we have no choice

but to go to the authorities.

Leave now and never come back.

This is your last chance.

Back up!

Back up.

Back up!

We don't want any trouble.

Okay.

Okay...

I will get him for you.




It's Cassidy.

We killed him.

James.

What are we going to tell the parents?

I don't know.

We can worry about that later.

We've just got to get out of here.

You shot me.

Why did you shoot me?

Kid ... You were out of control.

We didn't know what to do.




Looks like you found your friend.



You find this funny?!

It would be funny to die.

Ok, Sammie...?

You need help us get out of here

so we can call the police.

Can you do that?

How about my ten dollars now, huh?

Okay. Okay. Okay.

I'll give you twenty dollars

if you get us out of here.

What a big baby!


(Humming -- â™« Mary Had a Little Lamb â™«)

Do you think she knows where she's going?

I don't think we should be following her.

I don't trust this girl.

We don't have much choice.

I don't know...

(Humming -- â™« Mary Had a Little Lamb â™«)


Light switch... on!

Sammie...?

Do we have much further?

We've been walking a while.

A while?

They have no idea.

What?

(Door slams)

Sammie!

You there?!

Sammie!?

They chose...

poorly.


What do you want from us?

Fear...

I can't see a thing

Hey...

Wait up.

I can't see anything.

James?

What do you want from us?!

Delightful.

Your fear is exquisite.

I'm not scared of you!

Breathe in.

Breathe it in, child.

Breathe you stupid bitch!

Breathe!

Mother?

What are you doing here?

You're too late.

Where are we?

We were in your father's care room.

Not that you would know

since you never came to visit.

Are you okay?


Patricia!

Patricia!

Patricia! What are you doing?!

You're just making things worse!

Stop?

You never stopped him.

No. Stay away.

Please just stay away from me.

(Muffled scream)

Nothing.

Stay here. They'll be coming soon for you.

Sure.

Hey. Who are you?

What are you listening to?

You like that stuff?

Yeah.

You know, in this room... there are

straps.

Chains.

Whips and stuff...

You wanna go in there?

I really do.

Ooh.


So who is this?

I dunno.

Why? Does it matter?

No.

It'll be fun to have someone watch.

Okay, let's get started.

No way.

Yeah way.

Get on the rack, dog!

No treats 'til I say so.


Okay. Let's do it.

Not done yet.

Appreciation?

Not yet.

Shut up dog boy.

Ahem.

I don't have a key.

Who does?

K Hole.

So this was all for nothing?

I opened the door.

And I got him out of the way.

Now you just pull your hand out.

Just pull it through, huh?

Yeah. Break your thumb.

What?!

You're crazy.

Patricia needs us.

They're coming now. We don't have time.

This Little Piggy...

Whoa! Hey!

(Bone snapping)


Let's go now

Yeah, punk!

Say hi to Mama and K Hole for me.


Well...

Lead the way.

Hurry up!

Hey, how about we slow down a little bit...?

Know what I'm saying?

Maybe you should... take.

Take time to think about where we're going?

What do you think?

I think we need to help Patricia.

Look, the best help

for Patricia is for us to

get out of here and get the police.

There are only two of us, alright?

She has an entire army.

You know how long I've been in here

looking for a way out?

And you've been here for one second

and you want to go running to your mama?

We were here on a missing persons case

when we got stuck in this Hell maze.

You have no idea what a

Hell maze this place really is.

So what are you saying? You don't

know how to get out of here?

You're so stupid there's no way out!


Don't you touch me!

Don't you fucking touch

Don't you ever touch me!

Okay... okay, okay!

Look, calm down.

You want out?

You want out, right?

That's what you want?

Make a left at the

end of the hallway and open the window

and climb out.

Why surprised?

At least you have a choice.

Patricia

has

no

choice.

Sammie, listen you

have to understand

I think it's best that we get help.

Piss off!

We don't need you

I will save Patricia.

And when she has to die?

Again and again?

It will be your fault!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Ok?!

Please.

Please. He had someone help him!

He had someone help him!

He's a lying sack of shit.

Mama, I'm telling the truth.

Please, hear me out!

Wait, K.

I was on the other side of that door

Alright? Standing guard.

And this girl, she just came up to me.

She started to talk to me.

What did she look like?

She was wearing a dress

with a green army jacket and combat boots.

Brown hair...

and brown eyes.

Catch her name?

No... I...

What'd she say?

I dunno!

Look, we just came in here for a little bit of fun.

Alright? She said she was into me.

They were not alone.

Cara said they were alone.

There must be someone on the inside.

You must find this girl.

So I was able to help, right?

Now you know they have someone on the inside.

All will come out soon.

No. No, please!



I swear if that airhead is lying to me.

I'll kill her.

Another busy day?

I guess you guys never get a day off,

do you?


I have my ways.

You think Mama's the only one who can do voodoo?


Stay back!

Stay back or you'll be sorry.

(Voodoo babbling)

(Voodoo babbling intensifies)

What are you doing here?

I can be a hero too.

You can start with these two.

What now, huh?

Rip their masks off!

Where is K Hole?

Hell if I know.

You asked for me.

You want me to find her?

No.

Someone else will take care of that.

Just get back on the streets and make some sales.

Alright.

Kalfu...

Why is this happening?

Why is this happening all now?

How may we help you, Chief?

I hear there may be an issue.

Well, Mama.

It seems like things have been

a little light lately.

Well, not to worry.

I see bright days ahead of us.

Oh, I'm not worried.

But you should be.

It seems there's some skimming going.

Skimming?

It looks like, uh...

K Hole has been overspending quite a bit lately.

It's not good for business

Even if she's good at what she does.

Mama, you called for me?

Good afternoon, Chief Check.

Hope all is well.

Well I hear things getting better all the time.

Cara...

Yes, Mama.

I need your help.

I am humbled. Help from me!

I live to serve.

(Voodoo chanting)

(Voodoo chanting)

Why do you summon me?

There has been a great number of

disturbances in this house.

Tell me,

where do these come from?

The houngan, Marinette.

The Mambo who freed her people from bondage.

How do I appease her?

It's too late, Dominique.

One of your blood prisoners

roam free here.

The spirit is looking to free

her people from bondage

as mar does free hers.

But how do I rid this house of this spirit?

You must make the spirit give herself up willingly to you.

Until that time, she is filled with the spirit of

Marnet and cannot be harmed by you.

Thank you, Kalfou.

Remember, Dominique.

I'll be coming to get what is mine.

I know.

I hope you do


Where are we?

Wait. Where are we?! Where are we going?

Just calm down! It's me James!

-- so scary!

I don't want to be here anymore.

There has to be a way out of here.

I don't want to be here anymore.

Calm down, calm down. Sit down. Sit down!

What are we doing here?

You don't understand. That man, that thing!

He stuck a needle in my arm!

He stuck a needle -- He had scars all over him.

And then they held a knife to my neck

and they made me breathe in

Breathe in? Breathe in what?

Like a powder...

Zombie powder.

And then I was stuck in this nightmare.

My mom and dad were there and they were torturing me

and I couldn't snap out of it!

You were lucky.

Lucky?!

I don't feel so lucky!

You never made it to the blood room.

The blood room?

Wow, this just gets better and better.

Enough of this.

Patricia, let's... Let's go now.

You found a way out?

Yeah... Sammie told me about this window.

What window?


Stop, please.


She doesn't need us.

Patricia.

Please don't leave.

You understand now, don't you?

We have to stay in the nightmare forever.

Patricia, don't be scared.

You're... you're...

I'm trapped. Patricia we're all --

You're a... You're a ghost!

I'm not a ghost!

But you just --

Ghosts come from dead people,

I'm not dead!

This...

This isn't happening. Alright?

I'm arguing with a ghost!

Sammie. Sammie, I don't understand.

We're all being trapped here by Mama's black magic.

Where? Where is she keeping you?

Blood room.

Okay, so you can take us there.

I can't.

I'm too scared.

But you're there.

So... Sammie.

I mean

How can we fight black magic?

I mean, come on.

We will protect you.

Patricia.

Listen, this is crazy. Alright?

I mean, look!

We're talking to a ghost.

I came back for you so we could get the hell out of here.

I know... but I.

I just can't leave her

I'm not stupid, alright. I know there's something

going on in here that I can't understand. But...

I mean. What can we do?

Huh?

I don't know

Me either.

Go and get help.

Come back.

I'll come back for you.

We'll be here.

We?!

Oh yeah, that's right. You and, uh..

Casper here.

Alright.

Let's go to the blood room.

So, it is you Marinette chose.

Let's see how strong you really are.

(Voodoo words)

Kalfou.

(More voodoo words)

(Powerful voodoo words)

(The most powerful voodoo words)

Beware, child.

You will surrender yourself... to me.

I was... I was wondering if

I could have a few minutes of your time

to answer some questions?

I'm a Yale anthropology major

and I'm studying Haitian Voodoo

and its influence on history and culture.

Really?

Yeah, I'm interested in getting to know

more real perspective of the religion,

the less Hollywood version.

Oh, by the way...

Everyone calls me Sammie.

Okay...

Sammie.

Are you just here for me to make a

voodoo doll of your ex boyfriend

so you can stick it with needles all day?

No, I really want to learn!

There's some really interesting science behind Voodoo,

like the use of the powder of the blowfish.

Ah.

I see you've done your research.

Yeah, that's that's how you put people into a zombie state

to make them more susceptible to your charms.

Correct.

But our gods, they are real.

They're much more important than this...

blowfish powder.

I mean, of course, I meant no disrespect

but you know that

this powder is

getting very popular on the streets as a recreational drug.

Zombie powder?

And your point?

Well...

The university has found that if you mix it

with human blood, it increases its potency.

You sound as if you're making a recipe for a cake.

You must come to terms with

With

The soul and the emotions. The human element.

Well

When humans are in great fear...

It introduces chemicals into the bloodstream that

that are said to be very potent.

Really?

I must look into this.

I could help you find the studies if you like.

You can do much more than that, my dear.


Does anyone know his last name?

His last name's Wilder.

There it is!

And look at all the pretty Facebook pictures from their last vacation.

Don't people love to share?

Facebook sucks now that there's only old people on it.

Try Twitter.

Hello, I have some information concerning a Cassidy Wilder.

I heard there's a reward?

Thank you. I'll contact him.

Looks like the area code is right here in Newark.

It seems a James Gates

lives at 235 3rd Avenue.

I think it's time to go door-to-door.

Spread the good word.

Bring it to the people

Alright. Listen up, you screwheads.

Tonight, I want to see all this gone.

Seems like a lot to move in one night.

Listen up!

What you don't sell? You buy!

Open your mouth. Open your mouth!

Take it in!

Take. It. In.

Yeah?

Hold on...

You understand?

Alright. Yeah...

I've always got my knife.

Stay back behind the door.

You heard Mama I'm in charge.

Do it.

Oh, how cute!

Hello, little girl. I'm Cara.

What's your name?

I'm Jamie.

Is your mommy home?

Jamie, what did I tell you about opening the door?

Oh, please don't get angry with her. She's so darling.

Let me introduce myself.

My name is Cara. Cara Stegman

I'm with the DeSilva church here in town.

And I heard that you and your husband want to practice voodoo.

I'm sorry you must be mistaken. We don't practice voodoo.

You should learn more about it.

Mama is amazing.

I'm sorry. I really don't have time --

Hi James... tough day?

You look rough.

Yeah, I've had better. and finally get cleaned up though

Looks like I'm gonna be able to get home

and finally be able to get cleaned up though.

Are you sure, James?

I'm sure you two little girls aren't going to stop me.

235 3rd Avenue?

I know that place!

We were just nearby there.

Touch anyone in my family.

Anyone... I'll kill you.

Blah blah --

I'll kill you!

I'll kill you all!

If I have to die doing it, I'll kill you all.

Your daughter's eyes look just like yours.

Or maybe they're hazel.

Like your wife's.

Let me check.

Look, you moron.

Look. They're marbles.

Yeah, we got his attention.

Next time they will be real.

Hello, James?

You there?

Yes, he is.

One more time and they kill them both.

Mutant!

Daddy!

You know... You are really making this worse.

Alright, I'll do it. I'll do it.

You have two hours or we start

sending back real body parts.

Where?

Get them to the church auditorium.

Two hours.

Starting now.

We are going back to where you found me?

That's the entrance to the blood room.

Not exactly.

Why can't you go into the blood room?

I told you. I'm scared.

What are you scared of?

Mama?

That thing?

The Blood Punk.

That's the scariest thing I've ever seen.

I'm more scared of the blood prisoners.

Blood prisoners?

I can hear them all the time.

And they get louder as I get closer.

They're... damaged.

Violent.

They'll never be the same.

We can only stop the dream.

But you're one of them.

So you're afraid of what you will become.

Yes.

So what now? We just wait?

Yes.

Okay.

Yo.

Check what they've got to eat.

You realize...

You're going to be working for me

from now on?

Doubtful.

Mama put me in charge.

Finally, I will be able to spread Mama's message.

Mama's message?

Mama's messages is just

"Do more drugs."

That's it.

You are so blind.

Or maybe just dumb.

I'm not sure which.

Probably just dum -- I'd think twice if I were you.

K Hole got caught skimming.

She won't be coming around anymore

Leave my mommy alone!


Good one kid.

Your time is coming.

She doesn't understand. Please!

Keep an eye on them.

Oh yeah. They seem like a real handful.

You know I would give my life for Mama.

You may have to do that sooner than you think

you trustfund scumbag.

Pardon.

This will be important.

Yes Mama?

Here ya go, kid.

Have some fun.

Everything is set.

And we wait for your instructions.

You are very lucky, Jamie.

Mama has made you the star of the show.

And after tonight...

She will have a seat at the right hand of Mama.

You people are all crazy!


I thought you were afraid of the blood room.

This isn't the blood room.

The blood rooms down there where they're going

They're guards. -- Guards?

And the gas punks.

They're...

not very strong though and they're slow.

Good.

Okay. What's the plan?

I got it!

Play dead.

Play dead?

Go lie down there with that IV in your arm,

Gas punks will come out,

and they'll take you to the blood room.

And then what?

Can't do everything by myself, Patricia.

Remember? Ghost?

Yeah, this whole playing dead thing?

I don't have an IV bag.

There's used ones down there.

Just hook one up and wait for a gas punk to come out.

Once we get down there...

you'll leave me, right?

I can't go in.

But, I'll never leave you.

Once I get in the room

Once you get in, you free everyone.

How?

You take their needles out and run.

They'll all wake up.

Violent killers.

They'll protect you.

Believe me.

Okay

Tired yet?

Why?

Huh?

Why my family?

Why us?

I'm sorry, James.

Why then?

With all your power what kind of threat are we?

You're not a threat to me.

But it seems that

someone special

to me

cares about you and only appears for you both.

Who Sammie?

Yes, James.

Sammie.

So that's it

'cause she's a ghost, you can't control her.

Just try to bring her to the auditorium

and I promise that all of this will end.

How about Patricia?

Sacrifices need to be made.

I can't do that.

I can't give you Patricia.

No?

But she is mine.

You both were

as soon as you walked into my house.

I asked you both to leave but you both refused.

Alright.

I'll do it

But, if you hurt my family,

I'll kill every one of you.

No appearance of Sammie

at the auditorium?

And I will kill

your entire family.

Slowly.

While you watch.

Patricia. Where's Sammie?

James!

(Voodoo noises.)

Sammie?

You found her.

We found her.

Wonder what happened to the Sammie we know.

What do you mean?

You know, the ghost one.

She still around?

I don't know.

She's not here.

She said she couldn't come in here.

Alright, well...

Come on. Let's go.

That's not right. We can't just leave her here.

Besides, she asked me to free them all.

Yeah. That was before we had help.

Why don't we let the experts be the ones to help them?

Come on.

Bye Sammie.

We'll see you soon.

I can't wait for the cops to get here.

Yeah. They'll be here soon.

I saw a cop car patrolling the streets outside.

I was able to stop him and, um...

Told him what happened.

He called for backup.

Great.

Do you know which way to the auditorium?

He does not, Patricia.

Sammie!

We found you!

I was able to touch you. James went and got help.

Help's on the way for you and others.

He's lying!

What do you mean?

He sold us out to Mama.

They're all waiting for you in the auditorium.

You don't understand.

Don't understand?

What's going on James?

They went to my house, Patricia.

They got Donna and Jamie.

Donna and Jamie?

Yeah.

We have to go to the auditorium.

All of us. Including Sammie.

She's the one that Mama really wants.

She doesn't even care about us.

It's always been about Sammie.

What does she want Sammie?

I don't know. I stay far away from her.

What is it about her?

I don't know. Something about because

she's a ghost, Mama can't control her.

We all have to surrender to her.  All of us.

Surrender?!

I will never surrender to Mama.

Sammie, I have no choice.


Sorry, this is...

Sorry?!

I'm sorry too, James.

I can still have a life

so I choose to fight!

Sammie?

Sammie. Please.

Please?

Help me.

Alright?

I need you.

My family needs you.

This is my family.

Donna and Jamie.

Let's go to the auditorium.

Patsy.

Call Cara for me please.

Yes Mama.

Thank you, Patsy.

Let's make this

easier for everyone.

That is

so cool.

If they don't let my family go

'cause we don't have Sammie?

I'm gonna die trying.

Me too. Wait!

We're in this together.

Let's not rush it.

You said they didn't want to hurt us.

Okay. But if I get a chance?

If we get a chance.

We go down together

Okay.

No more.

That false Mambo bitch is going down.

Daddy!

Pooh Bear.

James! Who are these people?

What do they want?

Baby, just just stay calm alright?

It'll be over soon.

Well, James?

Where is she?

We told Sammie not to show up

until you free

Jamie and Donna.

Really?

It's the only way we knew you'd keep your word.

That is unfortunate.

Your time is coming.

You don't have to follow me.

Together.

I am growing tired of this!

If I can't have Sammie

then everyone that she cares about will die.

All useless and weak.

No!

Everyone stop.

Sammie.

The first.

I will kill you.

The pain ends now. For everyone.

It's been a long time since we last spoke, Sammie.

Are you ready to surrender?

Surrender?!

You will be the one screaming for mercy!

O, Mambo Marinette.

Please grant me the power of Dantor.

Use my spirit as a vessel.

And help me bring down this false Mambo.


I am not just some braindead being

you can scare with your childish tricks.


(Screaming intensifies)




Kill her! Kill her!

Sammie.

Kill her!

Kill her!

Are you sure about that, James?

Patsy, call Mutant.

On my command, you kill the family.

I surrender.


Trisha...

Trisha. Trisha!

What happened?


Come on, come on.

Finally.

Got rid of that nuisance.

Now...

as promised.

Both of you,

down to the blood room.

She could have beaten her.

So why'd she stop?

The same reason you came back to save me.

To save Donna and Jamie.

It's Cara.

Really?

Hello? Where are you?

We thought you were dead.

That kid stabbed me.

I'm going back into that house.

I'm taking them all back to the blood room

and hook them up personally

What is she saying?

(Tinny phone conversation)

She's going back to Mama to ask for forgiveness.

Forgiveness?!

Just meet us at the blood room entrance.

We have a new member, her name's Corinne.

She has this awesome little snake.

Hi Cara.

Who is this?

What's up big guy?

Ready for round two?

I know I am.

Patricia.

You'll have your chance... soon.

Rip the tubes out!

Wake her up!


(Still screaming)

Sammie. What's wrong?


Sa--

Sammie, what are you doing?

Sa-- No!

Sammie.

Sammie, stop it!

Please!

It's me. Patricia.

Sammie. Get up!

Notice how everyone you try to save wants to kill you?

Maybe you should take a hint.

Mama...

Can I be of any assistance?

Sammie!

Stop it!

No, Cara.

Sammie will be more than enough.

Sammie. What are you doing?

Sammie! Sammie please!

When Sammie is done... kill her.

Sammie. Sammie, please!

Stop!

Okay... As you wish

Sammie.

Sammie, wake up.

Baron.

I want her head on my shrine.

Everyone... Let's get out of here.

I've got to capture this.

Sammie?

Sammie, it's me, Patricia.

Come on you dumb bitch. Kill her already.

I'm running out of space.

Sammie!


Yes! Sammie!

Sammie.

She okay?

She breathing?

How about my ten dollars now?


Yeah, she's okay.

Hey, nice work, kiddo.

We really could've used that part of you a little bit earlier though.

I wish...

but I -- I lose control.

Once Marinette takes over my body I pretty much...

can't control myself.

But, you had control over it in the auditorium.

It was very hard to stop the feeling.

I couldn't stand the idea of Jamie being hurt.

I would rather die in here

than have people be hurt because of me.

Yeah, I know.

Look

I really want to thank you, alright?

Listen, when we get out of here.

And we will get out of here.

I want you to meet Jamie.

She can thank you personally.

That's...

That's very nice, but...

I don't think it's possible.

I'm still damaged.

We all are.

You seem fine right now.

I believe that Marinette made the chain

and, as long as it's here,

I can escape the rage.

So what about all of them?

As long as you have the chain

they won't hurt you, they'll protect you.

Still, I think this is where we should say goodbye.

Goodbye?

There's a trash chute over there that they use

to dispose of the drained bodies.

It leads, eventually, onto the street.

Oh, hell no!

Look. That bitch is going down! Alright?

I'm not going anywhere.

We're not going anywhere.

I don't think so, James.

You need to go back to your family.

The two of you have fought too long already.

It was never your battle to fight.

It's time for us...

to take down Mama.

Yeah. Us!

Alright?

I agree. James needs to go home.

Back to his family.

You can notify the police and shut this place down.

But I'm not going anywhere.

Right? End of story.

I'll make a splint for James' knee.

Help him through the tunnel and then

come back and we fight this together.

Besides, I think you forgot something

What?

This belongs to me.

He bought it. Remember?

Besides. It looks like you need this

now more than ever.

That's very true.

Dominique...

You look upset.

Well, my problem continues to persist.

Yes, I know.

That is unfortunate.

The end is near.

Thank you for your concern.

How do I defeat Marinette?

There are always options.

I'm listening.

Marinette would like to kill you.

So, if you are dead

then she will leave.

I do not understand

I love it.

Glad you are pleased.

We can still be together, Dominique.

(Voodoo chanting)

Aww, come on!

They must've locked it from the outside.

Mama sealed the door with her magic.

I wouldn't worry about it. It's gonna open soon.

Mama's building an army to take back the blood room.

Army? Okay...

We need to be prepared for that.

I mean, are there any other weapons

we could use here?

We are ready.

We have our own army right here.

They're waiting

(Voodoo chanting)

Marinette! Marinette! (Voodoo word)

We don't stop until we get to Mama.

O Marinette...

help me to defeat this false Mambo

and give me the power...

to raise your army!

(Voodoo chanting)

(More Voodoo chanting)

(Rival Voodoo chants)

(Evil Voodoo chanting)

(Rival Voodoo chanting cont.)

(Evil chant)

(Rival chant)

(Evil Voodoo climax)

Uh... they're coming up the stairs.

They're?!

Sammie and Patricia... are...

coming up the stairs!

And Sammie is looking really scary again.

Complete failure.

I have to call Mama and tell her.

Go down there and stop them.

Uhh...

I'm really not sure I want to do that.

You don't have to fight them.

Just go down there and slow them.

Get out of the way.

I can't let you through.


Soph...

Sammie and Patricia are on their way up.

Tell Mama I'm getting out of here.

It was all Mama!

I was just following orders.

I can. I can help you.

How can you help us, Patsy?

I can call them.

I can call them.

Bad move.

(Phone ringing)

Hello?

Hello?

Are you there?

Tell Mama...

it's Marinette.

She said she was marionette

and hung up the phone.

Where is Mutant now?

Setting up the blood room.

Good.

Mama, maybe it's best you try

to get out of here while

Mutant keeps them busy.

Run?

You want to run?

You could set up in a new town.

You coward.

You always run at the first sign.

It's not the first sign.

Ha!

Enough.



So...

I hear you've been stealing from me.

I'm sorry, Mama.

I was really desperate and

I just need a few extra bucks.

A few extra bucks?

Yeah, I promise...

I'll pay every cent back. I just

need to get...

back on my feet.

You will...

pay me back.

I just need some time.

You will

pay me back.

Right

now.

I don't have the money.

Don't worry.

Just do as I say

or I will be taking a pound of your flesh.

Mama. Yeah -- no...anything. Anything.

What's up with this?

That's messed up.

Idiots! Shut up.

You don't scare me with your facepaint

and your Voodoo bullshit.

You're the same coward you always been,

Sammie.

Look at her.

This isn't fucking good.

I don't care!

All of you!

Get her!

(Yosemite Sam noises)

(Yosemite Sam intensifies)

Idiots!

Incompetent assholes!

Impossible morons!

Get that away from me!

Get your dirty hands out of my --

Get back on your short bus.

Put those back!

You...!

You can run but you can't hide!

I swear, I'll kick your goddamn teeth

out of your skull!

Idiots!

You (?) assholes!

Impossible morons!

Whoa! What the hell did you

take to look like that?

Give me some.

What happened here?

I dunno. You tell me.

As you can see, I'm not going anywhere.

That's true

Seems dead.

Guess you guys won't get your chance to kill her.

Kill her!

Kill her now!

What are you doing? She's not dead yet!

(Spectral voice)
It must be terrible, child.

To kill me, you have to kill your friend!

Don't squeeze too hard.

You can't kill me now.

You're running out of time.

You'll never stop me.

I'll start all over again!

Sammie...

Noooooooo!

(Glass shattering)

We need back up at the church.

Franklin Street

Yeah.

Alright.




Seems like something happened to Sammie.

What do you mean?

But, you know. Know how she's always talking

about being damaged?

Looks like she really is now.

How bad?

Pretty bad.

She, uh...

She's

Yelling and screaming.

And just...

Talking nonsense.

Well, has anyone taken a look at her?

Lock this place up.

I don't want anybody in here until I tell you so.

Got it?

That will not be a problem.

Alright.

Hey Sammie.

How you doing?

Hi! (Laughing)

I'm Sammie!

You're gonna be okay.


I'll kill you!

I'll kill everyone!



That must be the girl they found in the church.

I heard they were giving her drugs

and she went crazy!

I will have vengeance!


She claims she's Mama.

Mama?

Yes, the woman from the news that --

captured all those people and ran that church.

It must be a protection mechanism.

No one can keep me here.

My power is infinite
