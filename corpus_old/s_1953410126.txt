My name is Brad Cohen

But when I was a kid

 people called me by lots of names.

My brother Jeff called me Dr. bow bow

My mom called me ha..honey

And in kids` school, well,
they called me everything.

From spares to feet.

I didnâ€™t have many friends actually.

But I did have a constant companion

I can barely remember a time
 when it wasnâ€™t there.

Now sometime it wasnâ€™t
 a problem for me.

Other times.....

It was.

Stop it.

Something scare you now?

Roll....

uh.

Give me a leave baby.

uh....

Cohen.. Cohen...Cohen...

What is going on?

Come on. Beat off.

Stop. Stop that fighting right now.

Come on.. Come on...

Get back to class.

Stop that nonsense.

You are in big trouble this time.

The girl fell in the mud and got dirty.

one thing my constant
companion and I agreed on

was that we hated school.

I couldnâ€™t wait through I got out.

No more home work..

No more books...

No more teachers` dirty looks.

Stop.

My companion first shoot off
 when I was Six.

But it was used when I had an eight.

Now the Psychologists said
 that just I was hyper.

I made funny noises, nap and weird,
to draw attention to myself.

It was just a phase. I grow out of it
 and be normal...

like  everybody else.

Through it all, my constant
companion stuck with me.

Now to my friends
I am just regular old Brad.

The guy who likes baseball.

and loves cheesy 80`s music

which they think is much
weirder than the noises I make.

<i>"...... searching low"</i>

<i>"Ba ba ba ba baby"</i>

<i>"Donâ€™t forget my number......"</i>

<i>"Ba ba ba ba baby......"</i>

<i>"Baby don't be stronger than
a thunder..thunder..."</i>

<i>"Ba ba...ba ba... baby...baby.."</i>

<i>"Donâ€™t forget my number..number"</i>

Good afternoon officer!

Was I speedy?

12 miles. Over the limit.

St. Louis ha..

Youâ€™re tourist?

Uh, no, I live in Atlanta,
I just moved here.

I guess I've little bit distracted.

So ... youâ€™ve been drinking?

No. No.  Sir, I.. I  have
'Tourette syndrome'.

Take it easy sir

I need you to sign here.

So what kind of job you look for?

Teaching.

Gonna be a teacher

uh..

I get there look a lot.

But I never allowed to get in.

I havenâ€™t seen anyone
 from Bradley University.

Illinois is on ... right?- Yes Madam.

Graduated (with honour)

High recommendations

You are a student teaching
about moral  outstanding.

Excellent!

What made you decide to go into teaching?

Itâ€™s all I always wanted to do,

Actually I was born to teach.

Why did you choose Atlanta?

I.. I  mean Missouri is your home.

Yeah. No Iâ€™m....

I think it's because Iâ€™m Braves fan ...

so ... aa....

Georgia honoured  my Illino
is teaching certificate .

Plus, I fell in love with Atlanta

When I worked down here
as a camp counselor

I live here now.

So live my dad and my step mom.

Well, its nice to have family here too.

Give you support.

Maybe we should talk about the elephant.

Elephant?

In this room ... my Tourette.

No, the  Americans with disabilities
 Act doesnâ€™t allow me to ask.

I know. But I would like to tell you

Just like I tell the kinds in my classes.

You see, I explain to
 the that  its a brain thing.

That causes middle. Make the
strange noises they are like....sneezes.

Irrepressible when you have to...

...you have to.

How do they react?

Once they understand, its fine thing.

It never cause a problem in the class room.

All I want is a chance.

Just give me the interview and let me
prove to them that I can do the job.

The Americans with Disabilities
 Act says I deserve a chance.

Ron!

They have to go?

Aaaa.....

You know ... Who wants
a teacher that barks like a dog?

You should try another line of work.

Are you serious?

Didnâ€™t they look at your rÃ©sumÃ©?

Aah..... Youâ€™re kidding me.

They are setting up some
interviews with school principals.

Fantastic!

when?

Eh...I do not know.
I got to wait for the call.

Get change and we get to go celebrate.

Havenâ€™t you got a date?

Eh... she.. sheâ€™s got a friend.

It is about time you start meeting girls.

I cann`t focus on dating right now.

Has anybody told you that youâ€™re obsessive?

Aa... Only every
shrink  I've ever saw.

Have fun focusing.

Oh, Your dad called again.

May be you should came back,

you know.

I will see you letter.

Returning dadâ€™s call?

Eh..

I had to prepare for that.

See mom and dad had divorced
 when I was a little kid...

and my relationship with dad
has always been...

Aaa.... let just say complicated.

I mean I wore out his patience
 like nails on a chock-board.

It didnâ€™t help that my brother
 Jeff was also a little hyper

Dad said he is waiting get back
 to his home Atlanta

He is waiting to say good bye.

Byeeee

You gonna make a mad!

Come on, race.

Against the Green Dragon?
You gotta be kidding.

Sucker. Thatâ€™s you are.

You go on a bike.

See you Jeff.

Hey.. thatâ€™s not fair

Youâ€™re not gonna beat me.

Oh! thatâ€™s not fair.

You are one bike.

*************

Ok Guys, quit down

We do have neighbours, you know.

Come here. Did you see? I beat you.

Ya...

You are driving her nuts.

Guys, listen. hey.. hey.. Stop it. Brad.

Help her around the house for most of all.
let us stop obnoxious behaviour. Okay?

Hey. Listen I mean it.

 think its funny but I do not.

Yes, you can. Its nothing wrong

Now stop it.

Bye bye Jimin!

I love you, dad.

Love you, too my kid.

And listen up.

Weâ€™ll stay my house next time. Okay?
Okay Dad.

I'll get tickets to see the Braves.

Brad!

Remember we talked about.
Self control.

Alright?

Do you need any help Mom?-
Well, now that you mention it.

After the divorce Jeff and I
 helped mom with a new business.

Sort of a high class traveling boutique

Well, may be help isnâ€™t exactly
 the right word.

Oh1 Ellen, these things are exquisite.

You never found style
 like these in San Luis.

That was directly from California
 Beverly Hills.

This is what everybody wear.
Look at.

Boys.

Boys

Hide and Seek ?

Account you- 1, 2, 3 ...

Now Ellen, I donâ€™t want to see
 anything from double size.

Honey! everything in California
runs small. Go ahead. just try it on .

Brad. Will you please calm down?

Barking like a dog for goodness sake.

Now look. Donâ€™t take this in wrong way.
You know I wouldnâ€™t say this to you.

We are friends.But have you
 considered an exorcist?

You know ... I think you might
accept that your size is 12.

I cut the label if it
makes you feel better.

Its a new doctor. Lets just
listen to what he has to say.

You know what you have to say.

Do you feel any anger
toward your mother ...

...because of a divorce?

No.....No....

Do you resent your father because
 he doesnâ€™t live with you?  hum?

No.

Do you blame yourself
for the divorce matter?

It happened when I was
little kid. I can not remember.

Ms. Cohen, Brad has some serious
 denial issues regarding a divorce.

What you need at home are some
clear boundaries he needs to understand.

that this behavior is totally unacceptable.

And that... Ms. Cohen..... is your job.

The hardest part was knowing
how tough I made things for mom.

I tried it best as I could for her.

Make sure that you take
my medications. yeah?

And for dad

Strike trees.

I played sports.

In the ball-field I felt right in..

I mean everybody makes funny noises
and has strange tics in a baseball game.

Lets Bob... Bob.

Come on Hard on them!

Come on Bo..Bo..

 Get him out Brad, get him out!

Come on. Brad, come on.

Yes, great play!
Come on!

Thank you very much.
Alright.

Hey guys.

I got some pretty exciting to tell you

Honey, Donâ€™t eat so fast you
so you cant get the hiccups.

Heâ€™s always got the hiccups.
You're a hiccup.

Listen, hey, would you just relax?

Mom says you are not taking your medicine.

How are you ever...

how you ever can calm down if do not
listen to the doctors pills prescription?

Pills makes it worse.

Oh, I see So your doctor now too. ha..

He is doctor Bo..Bo....

Shut up.

Al right guys, listen guys

I have a very important
announcement to make.

Guys.

Guys. Alright thatâ€™s it.
Go back to the car.

I am still hungry.

You know what would be nice?

One day ...! without you acting up.

One.

Wait up, Dad!

Whatâ€™s an announcement, Dad?

I've been seeing somebody.

Why mean seeing somebody?

Her name is Diane and ...she..

Brad please.

Stop doing that.

I cann`t.

I mean nothing happened yet but...

how would you guys feel about
 having a step mom?

No way.

We already have a mom.

Well, now you gonna have two.

I talked to mom about it.
She is fine with it.

She said... I said stop it..just stop it.

See I couldnâ€™t really blame
dad for losing it

My tics drove him nuts

Because like my teachers he had
no names for my strange behaviour.

Except insufferable.

Now somehow, I donâ€™t know how
 I made ok grades

But what would take  a normal person
an hour,took me two or three.

I mean I loved learning.

But I hated... hated reading.

Trying to concentrate brought out
 the worst in my constant companion.

Brad.

Come up here please.

I know you think the class clown,
but I have headache with you.

I cann`t........ help it.

Thatâ€™s what you always say.

I donâ€™t wanna hear anymore excuses.

Youâ€™re classmates are
trying to study...

...and your clowning makes it impossible.

Sorry.

Donâ€™t apologize to me.

Apologize to them.

Eyes up here everyone.

Sit up straight, please.

Brad has something to say to you.

I am sorry.

That you cann`t study because of me

And?

You promise never to make
anymore silly noises ever again.

Promise to all making no more
silly noises ever again.

Take your seat.

All of you back to your books.

It is difficult to resist.
May be for you, Ms. Cohen,

I assure you that the teachers
are at their wits end.

I understand that.... But I will ........

This will be a last chance

I mean the very last chance.

Brad

I called your mother

because things are just going
out of control for you.

Now she is gonna take you on this day.

You can come back

I cann`t help.

Sorry,  what did you say?

He said he cann`t help it.

Right.

What if he is telling the truth?
hum?

You got a right boy Ms. cohen.

But making excuses cann`t help.

Making excuses is not going to help.

He needs to use this time,
ask himself, this

Brad. Hello. Lets go. Lets go.

Why am I sabotaging myself.

I do not care if they I expelled me.

 I hate that school.

Well, is that school or another.

Hate all schools.

Why we are going here?

To find some answers.

I cann`t go in the library.

They will throw me out.

Please mom.

Alright.

Come here.

Sit over here.

Well, may be we are
going down a wrong track.

Who?

All of us.

Get off me.

Chihuahua, Chihuahua.
Ok you are really/

Oh No. I am not really.

I know you're busy Norman.

But I really think that
you should do this.

Boys keep it down.
Iâ€™m talking to your Dad.

I wanna talk to....

In a minute. Keep it down.

You know those teachers and Dr.

To them it is all about bad heritage.

Which of course comes down to me
because I am the only one here.

No. I am not blaming you, Norman.
In fact Iâ€™m gonna stop blaming myself.

I was talking to my friend and she
thinks that doctors are missing something.

I get to start medical
 books in the library.

And I have been doing
a little bit of research

Stop saying he just needs
a discipline, Norman.

Nothing I do helps.

He is out of control and I am at the
end of my rope.

Can I talk to Dad.

Can you just wait a minute honey?

Mom......

Alright, give it back to me
 when you're done.

What is it Jeffrey?

Hi Dad

It was a great thing (Game)

I managed two base hits and a walk.

Sorry because I caused
so much trouble on.

I want you to read something
in this book Iâ€™ve found.

Its a medical book that might
explain why you make all those noises.

I hate reading mom.

Read.

Tourette Syndrome.

That thatâ€™s Brad, isnâ€™t it?
the

These ... noises ... and ....tics...

 Iâ€™ve surely to do more tests.

But..... you may be right, and we
have been making a mistake with him.

I have never actually seen.....

.....a case Tourette before.

So at last my constant
companion  had a name.

This says that there is no cure ...

but that may have changed
this is an old book.

That hasnâ€™t changed, Ms. Cohen.

I'm really sorry.

If are they still looking
for a cure. Right?

I mean they will find one more day.

 They have....

Itâ€™s okay, mom. Everything
will be alright.

See? There is a reason, Dad.

I havenâ€™t been weird on purpose.

Listen up, Brad.

I am...

Alright...thatâ€™s all I wanted to say.

Bye.

Finally my dad believed me.

But he never believed in me
that I would succeed.

That I could teach.

Hello! This is Brad.

A dog?Aaa.. yes... yes.. madam
 that is... thatâ€™s my dog. Aha!

Aaa... Okay.

Yes. Yes I can there be 11:00 a.m.

My very first interview.

Great. That sounds great.

Ok. Thank you.

I tried not overreact.

I held in my tics.

Yes! Yes!

After the first call, I got two more.
Three interviews with three principals

Needless to say, my constant companion
 was more than a little enthusiastic.

Hum!

All I see that you have a bachelor degree.

Have you thought about the Master?

Yes sir.

As soon as I can.

We donâ€™t require for interview.
Let hope.

But if you seriously about......
I am very serious.....

I wanna make teaching my life.

I.....

I make these noises because
I have Tourette syndrome.

I would like to tell you about it.
Itâ€™s a neurological disorder.

Where my brain sends
make signal to my body.

Itâ€™s like sneeze.

Itâ€™s irrepressible.

However, in two week I will you call. Okay.

Okay. Thank you very much.
 Take care.

Well, strike one.

But, like mom always says
donâ€™t ever give up.

When I was little mom
never stop researching.

Because while there was no cure there
 might be ways to live a normal life.

Church mom?

Honey you are not gonna
 have to get a Bible lesson.

It's just a support group.

But we have to.

You need to connect with other
 people who have Tourette.

Find out who they live with it.

Hey...

Lets do it.

I am not going there ...

I had never seen anyone with
 Tourette before.

There were eye blinkers
and nose stretchers....

..foot stampers and neck chuck er....

..some of them yelped coughed.

Is this what I looked
like to other people?

Come on Bo Bo.

We have to learn. And start learning.

The Americans with Disabilities Act
gives us the right to do anything

.. we go on a place we want to.

But try to go to the movies.

..or consort or restaurant.

The law does not mean anything
when people yelling you to shut up.

I come home, and my parents
close the windows and blinds

because they donâ€™t want
neighbour to see me...

No one was even trying to be accepted

The adults were out of work,
the kids stayed at home.

I knew one thing...

I didnâ€™t wanna be like that.

Even his coaches and team
wouldnâ€™t accept him.

Oh! I cann`t hear it.

Of course yours home going too..

No. Brad goes to school
like any other kid.

These kids are like any other kids

School is a waste of time for them.

I got it in third grade,
just to save my sanity.

You want my advice.

You will do the same.

Lets go Bo Bo.

They're supposed to be a  support ...
But where is the support?

Just hide away rest of your life?

I am really sorry that I brought
 you here. Honey I just..Forget this.

I donâ€™t wanna forget this, mom

 people let Tourette wins.

We never gonna do that.

Its difficult to imagine
that at the age of 12

I would find a genuine
 philosophy to live by.

But here was this,
the defining moment

To always face my adversity head on.

When I went my next interview
I decided to be even more across.

Get the Tourette theme
 out of the way  first.

And then dazzle them with my
approach to teachings.

 ....very successful,
 in spite your Tourette.

I worked very harder to become
a best teacher I can be.

Thank you for coming here.
I will let you know.

Thanks.

So much should being a front.

For my third interview I decided to
 avoid discussing my Tourette at all.

Each week I like to send home a
progress report to my students` parents

I like to give my students..through this
they can interact in the classroom.

But also keep to the parents
 closely involved.

Ron it was a huge mistake
not mentioning my Tourette.

It was like, you know,
I was trying to hide it.

Okay. Thatâ€™s the negative.

Now the negative is that
 you get to stop stressing me out.

Stressing me out?
But the positive is that.......... Hey.

the other seems that

I just....

I gonna wait for the call.

The positive is  you come out with me.

My new girlfriend, she has a room mate.

Would you stop trying to set me off

When I am ready to date.

I will date.

Come on, she's heard all about you.

And she still wants to meet you.

Oh thanks. Youâ€™re kind.

Listen, I want to relax. Okay
And wanna watch the Braves.

We all wanna watch the Braves

Get changed

"Someone like you.."

Ron told me that youâ€™re finding
a job,  how are you doing?

Aah.. Pretty good!

Nobody hired me yet. I guess they
 are busy fighting get to me.

You do this?

I am impressed by this.

You should be.

I was not expacting this O..

Thatâ€™s amazing!

But Iâ€™m pretty good.
You are.

So you are really a sport fan?

Aa.. yes big fan.
Okay.

Soccer..... Soft ball.....Tennis..

Yep.. I have (been) learn in the college
but not good enough for the

I understand, because I wished I.
It isnâ€™t good enough to him.

Who?
Him

 Are you wanna be a "mesca"
Hmm..

His name is Homer.
Homer

-And itâ€™s a life long ambition.
Okay. Alright.

Donâ€™t look now. Donâ€™t look now.

There is a guys behind us
and I donâ€™t want his problem is

Keep staring.

Aah..

I actually get that they look a lot.

It's a look an envy.

Itâ€™s thinking how can I make
all noises like that guys?

Youâ€™ve such a great attitude about you.

Goodbye Homer. Bye.

Bye Ron.
Bye Bye.

Bye Homer

So that must have gone well.
Ha?

Did you ask to be seen again?
Yes I Asked.

Yes, but you know the
 second date syndrome.

You know, I'm a great guy,
 it was lot of  fun, but ...

Your tics are just too cool for her.

I actually said that my
roommate Brad smell so bad.

What do you mean?
You know what I mean.

This is Brad.

Oh, hi dad.

Yeah, No  Ron would be called that
You know I've been so busy ...

No. I havenâ€™t had lunch yet.

Alright. that sounds great.

Where do you wanna meet?

Lunch at Dad's work.

He wouldnâ€™t have to worry
 about my noises there.

 Let me know if you need more
 of these trusses. Okay?

Alright.

Hey!
Hi Dad

You could reach.
Of course.

We have lunch outside my office?
little more private.

Alright.

Dianne wondering when
you will come by.

I guess it has pretty busy with job.
 Have you got?

Still  interviewing.

Howâ€™s that going?

I think you are in trouble
with those rubbish

You can say the word, dad, Tourette.

Some of them mark it.
Some donâ€™t mark.

And how is your money holding out ?
I am not asking you for money.

I know that. You never ask
me for anything.

No.

But if you ever do, get sure
 you know you get a job.....

I am gonna teach there. Okay?.

I can not let anything get with that.

Okay.

Iâ€™m just saying that it is nothing wrong
with keeping other options open in case
things donâ€™t work out.

You know there are other
things besides teaching.

Not for me.

Dad could never understand my optimism.

Like, when I graduated middle school....

I was really hopeful for things
would be different.

Whatâ€™s a matter Brad? Eating alone?

Make a fresh start.
New school. New friends.

....and same result.

Today we gonna talking about fractions.

Fractions are your friends.

We use fractions in everyday life......

......you just donâ€™t realize it.

For example, say your mother bakes a cake.

She cuts that .......

Cohen?

Just go to the principalâ€™s office.

Not the best way to introduce
 myself to the Principal.

What do you think the school for, Brad?

Sorry for disturbing the class.
You arenâ€™t answering my question.

Whatâ€™s the school for?

To educate.
Isnâ€™t it?

To use knowledge without ignorance.

The school orchestra has a concert
 this afternoon, do you plan to go?

No Sir....my tics would ruin the music.

I want you to be there.

Everybody just keep your seats
 for a minute, please.

Thank you. Enjoy the Concert

Great job.

Did you hear any noises
 during quite breaks?

Yes.....

Yeah, Sure did I.

The pretty annoying. Arenâ€™t they?

The person makes these
noises is Brad Cohen.

Come on, up here Brad.

Do you like making these noises
and upsetting people, Brad?

No Sir.

Then why do you do it?

Because I have Tourette Syndrome.

Whatâ€™s that?

It's something in my brain
that causes me make rude noises.

But you can control if you wanna, right?

No......No Sir.

Itâ€™s a sickness.
Hum...

Well, why cann`t you just get cured?

There isnâ€™t any cure.

I donâ€™t like making noises anymore....

...then you like hearing now.

Thatâ€™s even  worse when I get stressed,

when you do not accept
that I cann`t stop them.

But..when I feel accepted,
not so bad.

What can we do?

And I mean everyone in this school.

What can we do to help you, Brad?

I just wanna be treated
like everybody else.

Good job!

You may sit down.

A few words....A little education...

....and it was like opening a door
through a brand new world.

Now someday, somewhere I knew
Tourette or no Tourette

I was going to be a teacher.

I had no choice.

But to prove Tourette
would never get the best way

If  I quit, I would agree everyone....

who had ever told me I was
barking  up the wrong tree.

Hum.....

hum.

I am sorry about it.

For air conditioning now.

Supposed to be fixed now?

No. It doesnâ€™t concern.

Well youâ€™re resume looks okay.

And we do have an opening
in 5th grade.

Okay.

But I do have to tell you
this is a tough place to work.

We get some really hard cases.

Well Iâ€™ll take that as a challenge.

I donâ€™t think that
 any kid is hopeless.

Nearly all wanna learn.
You cann`t give up.

Get to find around a
way to teach them.

Ah.. You get stucking your throat.
would you like a drink?

I have Tourette Syndrome.
I like to tell you....

Tourette? Isnâ€™t....

That you yell out obscenities.

That is coprolalia.
Itâ€™s a rare symptom.

Itâ€™s a          people Tourettes have

Okay. Listen. Did it not tell me
that you are gonna be handicap

How do expect to handover
a bunch of wild students....

with handicap like you ?

Well...

.... by educating them.

I let them know that
itâ€™s ok to talk about it.

These students would laugh at you.

Aaa.....

Not..Not when they understand
itâ€™s simply....

Okay. I have seen teacher
with disabilities before .

And never with what you get.

I just donâ€™t see how you
could ever teach a class.

I can teach.

Look at my resume.
 Look at it.

Okay. I was very
 successful student.

My Tourette never posed a problem.

I can teach.
A bottom line.

I need somebody now
 for the 5th grade


...you gonna have to refrain from
making these noises in class.

Thank you very much for the
interview.

But donâ€™t you want a job?

Yes, Actually.

I want it really.

But I would never....

....ever work for man who doesnâ€™t
 care about his students

So I take my port folio
and take no more your time

You got a great boss.

It was the worst interview
 I ever had.

Only they could like to look at
 my Tourette.

If all any of them see.

Well, honey if they cann`t see
what a great teacher you would be.

That is their failure not yours.

Well, it should seem like my failure.

Well... If you say so... you know what....

Why donâ€™t you just throw
the    and come home?

Iâ€™ll buy you a ticket.
I am not saying that.

Really? But sounds like that
what you saying.

It sounds like you `re
 letting Tourette win.

I am not letting Tourette win.

Really?
Yes, Really!

Look. I never gonna give up. Just...

I have to find a right school.

You will Bo Bo...... You will.

So I decided it wasnâ€™t Tourette.

I just hadnâ€™t found a right school yet.

I would keep working and I wasnâ€™t quitting
until I found there Principal.

I made a map of every school
where I hadnâ€™t interviewed.

If the principal wasnâ€™t in,
I gave my resume to a secretary

...or     and asked them to drop it off
when the principal returned

I didnâ€™t care. I needed a job.

I wasnâ€™t gonna stop until I had.

you will be starting at the bottom
but thatâ€™s not a big deal.

That's where I started,
and nearly worked 7 to 4.

I told you this is only  part time,
I need keep my morning open for interviews.

I thought your school had started.
No. Not at all.

Well, we'll see what happens.

Here are tools for trainee.
At least for the time being.

Like I said, from below.

But every job is important here and
know where you can like it.

And as your time begin ...
Do not you hear what I just said?

I only work here until
 I get a teaching job.

All that stuff has to go to dumpster.

The hiring season was ending.

My interviews had dried up.
School had started.

I was running out of time
and money and hope.

"DOOR BELL RINGS"

Dianne.

I gave up on you ever come to me
so I just came to you.

Are you busy?

It was my step mom Dianne,who was
trying to build bridges with Bo Bo.

Your dad built his business
 with his own hands,

You cannot blame him for wanting
you to be part of it participate.

You just be your dad.

He wants you in his life.

So, how do you like Atlanta?

Do you meet any nice girl?

just say the typical things, right?

Let me give you a refill.

Brad... Brad...

Your dad loves you....

..so much.

you just do not want to see get hurt.

The only thing that hurt is the fact that
he has never accepted who I am.

See, heâ€™s got this idea for a
perfect son  who is normal....

...and does normal things.

Well, I never gonna be normal.

Or may be thatâ€™s not his idea, Brad.

May be thatâ€™s yours.

Youâ€™re right. You are not normal.

You have the gift....

.....to teach.

And itâ€™s not in spite of your Tourette....

.....itâ€™s because of him.

I have to go.

TELEPHONE RINGS

Hello, itâ€™s Brad.

Aaa.... Yes. Thatâ€™s a street dog.

Aa.. ha...

Yep, Brad... Brad  Cohen.

10 oâ€™clock is perfect for me.

Absolutely.

Okay. Great!

You must be Brad Cohen.

Aa.. ha..

My name is Phil, I'm the principal
around here.

I'm Hillary. Assistant principal.
Hello.

Come on in the office, Brad.

We heard you coming all
the way from the parking lot

You have been making the round.

25 schools so far.

And....

 Here, here is my resume.
Oh here? Oh...

We can look at that I mean, Brad,
just come on in and......

 Tell us why do you wanna be a teacher?

 Okay.

Well, its a hope. (HE LAUGHS)

Itâ€™s what I always wanted to be
ever since I was in the school.

You must have pretty inspired in teachers.

Well, I had an inspiring
principal Mr. Mayer.

But my teachers,..

..they really only inspired me to be
gonna teachers they never were.

What kind of teacher is that?

One who makes possible for
kid for learn even if heâ€™s different.

In a way that.... the best teacher
 I ever had was my Tourette.

You donâ€™t have to talk about.
No No itâ€™s okay.

I make a point of being
 open about it.

Itâ€™s a never out of my students.

They can ask me anything
they want about, anytime.

You must get some pretty
interesting questions.

Oh! Ya.., sometimes
 it gets really personal.

I hope this question is
not too personal, Brad.

Do you make those
noises in your sleep?

I donâ€™t know.

I am in sleep.

No. No. I donâ€™t tic in my sleep.

When I am relax the noises
give a little bit of break....

....just like now.

Okay Brad. I wanna hear more
about your teaching philosophy.

I would love to tell you
about my teaching philosophy.

We talked for nearly two hours.

It was the best interview I ever had.

Well, Brad it was a pleasure
 to meet you.

Yeah.. Me too. Me too.

There are still many
teachers to interview..

...but I'll let you know
what we made a decision.

Okay. Great

Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

Yes.

Still my constant companion is always
warned me not to get my hope so.

But hope is a hard habit to break.

I was called one last time.

And asked to come in and meet
with 2nd grade students.

Oh. So you student taught
2nd grade. Oh I love 2nd grade.

Because you still so open minded.

They are open to everything

You do manage to maintain
little discipline, right?

 While we being so open...

I do let them know what
the boundaries are. Yes.

So Brad what do you think is the most
 important thing you have to teach?

Yeah. Well.. Besides the importance
of reading and value of math....

...that itâ€™s ok to be yourself.

Itâ€™s okay to color outside
the lines, if that is who you are.

So itâ€™s okay to ignore
the boundaries?

No I ... I didnâ€™t that.......

I am sorry but how could
you expect kids to learn,

when you doing that all the time

Oh come on, Brenda....
No. No. Itâ€™s okay.

Itâ€™s a valid question and
 I wanna answer it.

Before they know me kids sometimes do
think I am just weird or even scary.

But once I educate them
about my Tourette..

..and they can see
Mr. Cohen is a real person.

Who just happens to make funny
 noises, well, then they accept me..

....as a good teacher.

Just like they accept our view.

Well, may be we should all try
 to be more like 2nd graders.

Does anyone have any other
question for Mr. Cohen?

Brad, thanks for coming in.

This school will be in touch
with you and so just be patient.

Itâ€™s hard to patient when you feel
you're going for a last chance.

And patience was never my constant
 companion strong with me.

I guess you never heard that school.

No. Not yet,  they're still interviewing.

No worries.
Okay.

-What that suppose to mean?
I just said okay.

I know what you mean.

You donâ€™t think anybody will
hire me if they have choice.

Do you read the mind now?

You know that this is
gonna be my last day here

Why donâ€™t you wait to
if you get the job first?

Iâ€™m gonna get the job, dad.

-I just have to stay focused.

Why cann`t you just stay focused
 to realistic at the same time.

Whatâ€™s wrong with that?

Well, Are you alright man?

What is that happens while you driving?
I am fine.

Yeah. I donâ€™t know.

Yes, you see another doctor.

I have seen doctor in whole
 life, Ron. They donâ€™t help.

Well, you think you need to see somebody?

I really donâ€™t.

There I was waiting for
the phone ring again.

I tried to convince my self
something good would happen.

DOOR BELL RINGS

My kid brother.

Not exactly what I had in mind.

How you doing, Bo Bo.

What.. what are you doing here?
Why didnâ€™t you tell me youâ€™re coming?

You just saying to distract me because
you know Iâ€™m going to beat you.

I am serious Brad.
You and dad are getting along.

We get along just fine
as long as we keep a long distance.

Is that you moved down here to
keep a long distance?

I mean, you do not give
 anything to prove, right.

What are you now Jeff, shrink?
Dr. Jeff? Huh?

I am sorry sir.

I am going to have ask you
to stop making those noises.

-Look pal, you are not doing.......
No, no, I cannot, Jeff. I got it..

Look, that is not fair to other golfers.
.

 I understand, I cann`t help
 making those noises

Because I have Tourette syndrome.
 Itâ€™s a neurological disorder.

I would like to tell you
 about it. Since I

You get to have leave the course.

I get to think about the other members.

Hey Joe, leave these guys alone. Itâ€™s fine.

Okay. Okay. Hmm..... Ok.

Thanks guys. May next time, right?

Jeff, come on. Come on buddy.

How can you stand living in a world
where everybody is so ignorant.

Everybody is not.

You saw the golfers back there.
They want to back for me.

That is what my experience.

Well, thatâ€™s because youâ€™re always

Jeffâ€™s visit did give a break for my words.

And right after he left
 I got call from the school.

Pretty noisy, huh?

And yet somehow the kids manage.

Donâ€™t they?

Yes they do.

Yes.

Is it catching?

No. Absolutely not.
You have to be born with it.

Well sometimes. When my neck jerks.
But the noises do not hurt at all.

These are great questions.
 Keep it coming.

It is okay to ask me anything...

Yes.

Can you go to movies?

Yes, I can go to movies but
sometimes I get kicked out.

And that makes me sad.

His name is just Waffle.

Alright guys.

Any more questions about Tourette?

Anyone.

Are they ever gonna make

Well, right now there is no
medicine  that can cure Tourette.

But its okay.

Because Iâ€™ve learnt to accept it
and I donâ€™t let it ruin my life.

Aha....

What can you do? Like...

.....can you not eat?

Oho..oo... I can eat.
Okay I eat a lot in fact.

I can do anything that anybody
 else can do. Except there is.......

can never do.

What? What is it?
No I can not..No I just cann`t...

No...
Come on tell us. Tell us.

Yeah, Tell us....

Mr. Cohen can never play.....

....Hide and Go Seek.

Why cann`t you play Hide and Seek?

Because they hear him, stupid.

Well thatâ€™s the right answer

coining in Mr.Cohen`s class.

Excuse me where are you going?

There was a bruise.

Will you excuse me. Nancy needs in the
 kitchen and it will take just one second

I go to the kitchen.

Are you rescuing me again?
I donâ€™t need rescuing.

I do.

Whats` going on?

How is your pedicure?

If youâ€™re wondering when
your mom and I talked about

I talked about you and us.

Something wrong?

I am just wondering
if  I told you......

I love you.

I mean.. it just scares me...

I never thought about it before...

...neither they had think about it.

Look Brad.

She understands about
your noises she doesnâ€™t care.

You know. You would make
 her happy. She told me that.

Brad, you make her laugh

Of  what about one day
when she stops laughing.

What of one day...

...she gets fade off...

.....of living with someone who...

I donâ€™t wanna hurt her, Mom.

Maybe you do not
 wanna get hurt.

The only thing that can
hurt either of you.

As if you that Tourette
 drive her away from you.

If you let him win.

Heatherâ€™s mother had called to say

Heather was no longer
able to attend school.

So the class all pitched
 in cheer her up.

Oh wow look at this table.

Looks very good.

How they looks great over here.

The news we all had been

Hey? whats up Henry?
Hi Mr. Cohen.

Hi.

Hello Mr. Cohen.

Hey Mr. Cohen.

Jane and Charley.

Sir, they about to
start the sermons.

You go ahead.

Mr. Cohen.

I am sorry.

I thought I could but I...

I think I will be too disrupted

You made such a huge
difference in Heatherâ€™s life.

You were her favorite teacher.

Please donâ€™t leave
without... about her.

Okay, Thomas,  what is
 your teamâ€™s word?

Weird.

Weird?

Anybody not in Thomasâ€™s team
know what that word mean?

Strange. Creepy. Scary

Very good.

Who can use the word
 'Weird' in a sentence?

 Me...Me...Me.....
25, 30, 35, 40 ... takes it 50, Galen!

I like weird movies.

Sorry Mr. Cohen. I know you can not
 go to the movies because it could
take from there.

Well thatâ€™s ok Galen.

Boom! Because I can rent movies,
and I also like weird movies.

So weird is a good word. Right?

But what if someone
comes up to you and says

"Hey! you.Yea Iâ€™m talking
to you, you weird"

Is it still a good word?
No.....

What's that? Hey come on.

Okay everyone
stay in your seat.

Itâ€™s Maxine in Big Red.

Mr. Cohen, can we go to see.

Okay. But everyone inside voices

Everyone line about
the door and no running.

You got it. Yea exactly.

Eli, get in there.
Alright be careful.

What do you think about

 Eli,  what I tell you?
Alright,  No blowing horn.

Or everyone will have to get down.

Sorry Maxine.

Thatâ€™s alright.
Kids will be kids.

Yes. Yea..Yea they are well.

I like Nancy.

She reminds me your mom

I donâ€™t look anything alike.

I donâ€™t talk about look.
Iâ€™m talking about that.....

...spark, you know,
spirit that..a genius require.

How is your school?

You know, you get more books
 than book cases, roof leaks

There are many teachers with
 lot more experience for me.

I am prouding you regardless.

Doesnâ€™t feel that way.

Why do I feel that you feel
embarrass about me.

And itâ€™s okay that you admit it.

Are you trying to start a discussion?
No...No.No..

But you know we `er talking...
And its good lets talk.

I have always been
embarrassment to you.

Even when you used to come visit me
you used to scold among others and used
to quick my way.

You have never been
able to accept it.

You `re right.

It is tough to be
with you sometimes.

I hated when we go to restaurant
and people give you looks

Sometimes I wanna just.....

...I just feel so helpless.

You know I always tried
 to fix things.

But the one thing I could never fix.
that one thing is hurting you more.

It doesnâ€™t leave fixing.

Nobody can fix it.

I know.....I know..

But...... may be......

...itâ€™s my fault.

May be I gave it to you.

Come on guys, we only got 2
minutes  closing, hurry up back there.

Stand to the side,
 Stand to the side. what I tell you ?

Guys in the back,
come on hurry up.

Dad, what are you doing here?

Son you needed book shelves.
Didnâ€™t you?

Your father had built this new
 book shelves for the library.

Things are slow at the office.

This way gentlemen.

Oh! I got you some
 for your collection.

Put it on Mr. Cohen.

A hard hat for an
extremely hard Head

Hey class thatâ€™s my Dad.

Hi Mr, Cohen.
Hi.

Come on.

Come on.

Hillary didnâ€™t say
what this was about.

No idea.

We were in recess and she said she
needs see you in the classroom.

I think that might be
about next year.

Here it is

Brad, will you come over here
 a minute please.

Hillary has got an
announcement to make.

Some of you may have noticed an observer
hanging around school for last few weeks.

Well, he was here to assess
one of our teachers

Mr. Cohen.

And I am here to announce
that our own Brad Cohen

..has been chosen for amongst all the new
educators in The State of Georgia.....

..to be Sallie Mae`s first year
Teacher of the Year.

As I looked at my students
 I felt like a kid inside

Because children look at life
 differently than most adults.

They see the world
and say I will. Not I cann`t.

And so did I.

This shirt is too tight that label
appearing on my necks.

I can make up the label

I donâ€™t understand why youâ€™re
so nervous about.

You face crowd everyday.

Well, these arenâ€™t 2nd graders,
you know.

Oh! man I wish I was invisible.

That's something that
you never have to worry.

Be still....Be still.....

I love you.

Come on Bo Bo you
 can get through this.

Donâ€™t worry, heâ€™s gonna
get through it.

The noise you just heard is
Tourette Syndrome.

I have been living with
 since six years old.

Iâ€™m standing up here today..

.. because the love and support of
 lot of people put me up here.

My family....

My school family.....

My students and all my friends

I owe this toward all of them.

But I also owe it to the toughest
and most dedicated teacher I ever had...

My constant companion
my Tourette.

Now some of you may think
thatâ€™s pretty weird to thank Disability

..and calling it a Great Teacher
thatâ€™s really weird.

What can I possibly learn
 from Disability?

Yes Galen.

You learned to keep going.

Eli?
You learned not to leave that stops you

Yes Thomas.

You learned not to let it win.

Thatâ€™s right.

Coping with my Tourette taught
me  the most valuable lesson..

...that anyone could ever
 learn and that is.

..To never let anything stop
you from chasing your dream.

From working.

While playing

While falling in love.

Thatâ€™s right.

Coping with my Tourette taught
 me the most valuable lesson that..

Yes, Thomas.

Can you bring the award
to show on Monday.

Sure.
