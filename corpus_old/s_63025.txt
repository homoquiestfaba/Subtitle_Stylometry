How was school ?

Fine.

Don't forget: Tomorrow's the day parents

Oh. Well, I might have to work.
You want me to ask off ?

Oh, no. That's okay.

Parents coming to school--
whose idea was that anyway ?

But ifit's important toyou, Penny--
Did the letter come ?

Letter ? Uh, gee, well--
What letter ?

I don't-- Oh, yes.

Theysaid twoyears as asecurityguard

Oh, well--
[ Sighs ]

Look, I know that
Nicole's dad is a lawyer,

IfI only had that badge.

UncleJohn, it's not the badge,
it's the heart behind it.

I'm very proud ofyou.

Fingers crossed.

Fingers crossed.

This chip is gonna make
the whole Gadget project work.

-Dad, concentrate. Try to move the foot.

Allright. Kick theball.

Nothin'. I'm hungry.

Okay, all right. I'll go get us
some dinner. But then we keep going.

Yeah.
Okay. I'll call the guardhouse...

so they don't search

Hello, Antonio's ? Yeah, it's Brenda.
No, foot's still not moving.

Dad, keep thinking about

It's what I've always wanted to do.

Help people, that is.
Um, I gotta--

Dr. Bradford is out

He was a good man.
Oh. D-Did you know him ?

No, I didn't.

So, how soon can you fi nish

I'm sure that he would have wanted me
to fi nish it as soon as possible.

Mmm. Oh.
Yeah. With the, uh,
" English Patient" there ?

That's enough, Quimby.
Sorry. Just doesn't look like
you got off to a good start.

[ Laughing ] So, how can you be so

Oh, by the way, what do we have
on the Artemus Bradford murder ?

Well, we got a limo
with no license...

and some scrap metal from whatever
it was that broke into the lab.

Do we at least know what was stolen ?
According to Doctor Bradford,

a robotic foot.
Robotic foot.

A robotic foot ?
Yeah.

What kind ofcyberfreak

A hillbilly with a tuxedo ?

No, you idiot !
No !

[ Chuckles ]
It's a nickname--

one that will send my enemies
cowering in fear.

Ah.

Ah, too bad
" Hook" is taken, huh ?

How 'bout... "Captain Claw" ?
Oh.

No, no, no, no, no--
Or "Santa Claw. "

Just "Claw."
One word,

like " Madonna."

Well, anyhoo, Captain--
Sir-- Mr. Claw,

I know how much you like
to maintain an active lifestyle,

so I have managed to design...

a few interchangeable options.

[ Mechanical Noises Continue ]

I don't know what's wrong.
I, uh-- I seem to be ill,
and I can't remember anything.

You may not remembervery much
right now. You suffered a major
concussion in the explosion.

What happened ?
You'vejust come out of
a very long recovery.

You are now a sophisticated network
oftissue, hardware and software.

No ! I gotta get outta here.

Mr. Brown--
Mr. Brown, come back here.

We're gonna go in--

I don't wanna be like this.

I don't understand

Guess I'm all set then.
Right. Oh !

There's onemore thing.
Ialmostforgot. It's important.

Your new wardrobe.

The Gadget suit.

Okay, so ifyou want to operate
one ofyour gadgets,

you simply say "Go, go, Gadget,"
and then you name the device.

Well, couldn't I say
something more official, like,

like, "In the name ofjustice."

[ Giggles ]
Well, you could, but it wouldn't work.

But "Go, go, Gadget,"
sounds so--

My father designed
the program, and he--

Oh ! Oh-oh-oh-oh !
It's "Go, go, Gadget."

I really like it.
Okay. Good. I'm glad.

So, okay, let's say there are two guys
trying to rob ajewelry store,

and you wanted to trip 'em up--
what would you do ?

Okay, uh, let me think.

You made me a car ?

The only thing anybody's
ever made me before is a sweater.

Now, it may look simple,

but this thing hasjust about
as many factory extras as you do.

Come on !
Get in there !

Oh--
Watch the coat. Okay.

[ Mechanical

Gosh, she's incredible.

Oh, it's a he.
Excuse me ?

You'll see. Okay, now, it has
voice activation, ejection seats,

a power-assisted metamorphic camouflage
system, a cardio-homing device.

Then there's a periscope, a candy--
Dr. Bradford,

there's something
I just have to askyou.

Oh,just say, "Go, go, Gadgetmobile."
Yes, but will you--

"Go, go, Gadgetmobile" ?
Good morning, Riverton !

Hey ! Who's in the car ?
I work alone.

Hey, before we hit the road,
I gotta tell you somethin'. Duck !

[ Gasps ]
I don't think the car likes me.

Hey !

It's a Disney movie. Now, I'm gonna

Could you slow down, please ?
I-- I get carsick.

You know what makes me

he's good enough for Dr. B.

Not that it's your business,
but what makes you think I was
putting moves on Dr. Bradford ?

Hey, I've got heat sensors.
I know whatyou were thinkin'
when Dr. B. gaveyou that smile.

Now, look here. Come clean with me, or
I'm gonna bounceyou right outta here.

I can assureyou my only interest
in Dr. Bradford is professional.

[ Gadgetmobile Laughing ]
" Professional," huh ?

Well, good. Keep it that way,
andthat's an order.

You got it ?
Uh, I'm the inspector, you're the car.

I'll tell you whatyou are.

Permission to speak freely, sir.
No.

[Kitten Meows]
Well, ifyou're gonna pout.

Thankyou, sir.

What I want to say is that,

while I appreciate cute and fluffy
as much as the next officer,

I fear that the kitten-rescue patrol
is a misuse ofmy capabilities.

Huh. You know, I don't get it,
Gadget. Every timeyou--

I won't be happy
until I've brought the murderers
ofArtemus Bradford tojustice.

Ah. And I won't be happy
until you're off the force,

andbeingsold, piecebypiece,

[KittenSlurping]
I want that case, sir.

Well, I'll tell you,
the problem is the Bradford case
requires real police work,

and the fact is, you're not
a real police inspector.

Good. Imitation is the sincerest form

Isn't that Dr. Brenda Bradford's

Oh, yes.

I tapped into her fi les
and stole her research.

Whywould you do that ?

[ Imitating Kramer] "Whywould you
do that ? Whywould you do that ?"

[Cackling, Sighing]

Ah. Oh, oh.

Kramer, don't look
so nonplussed.

Now that Dr. Bradford is part of
the Scolex team, we share everything--

oratleast we will.

Oh, well, I think sharing fi les is a
great way to bring the company together.

You know, make sure we're all singing
off the same song sheet, so to speak.

Eyewitnesses told me
that he was laughing...

What's gone wrong ?

Other reports indicate that he's
already caused a major traffic accident,

Go, go, Gadget--grappling hook.

Whoo !
[ Screaming ]

[ Television Reporter Continues ]
-John !

What happened ?
I'll go get Scolex. Maybe he can help.

Brenda, it's not safe here.
Scolex is a liar and a thiefand--

Let'sjust say
he's not a very good guy.

Go home !
Lockyour doors !

Stay alive !
Whatever happens, I will fi nd you.

Oh, too far !
Whoa !

[Screaming, Thudding]

'Cause I am.

[Voice Trails Off]

Greetings, Inspector.
Glad you could drop in.

I oweyou one, Scolex.
Oh ?

You blew up me and my Chevette,
and I really liked that car.

Well, you crushed my hand,
and I really liked that hand,

so, go, go--
get over it.

Idon'tknow whatyou're up to, Scolex,
butyou'llnevergetaway with it.

[ Cackling ]
Oh, how cliche, Inspector.

I think somebody's been watching
too many Saturday morning cartoons.

Hmm ?
Huh ?

Huh ?

Unfortunately, Gadget,
in the real world,

evil quite often prevails.

I'm afraid so.
Pull him up.

Now, look howyour replacement
is helping people...

-[Cackling]to cross thestreet.
Hey.

He looksjust like me.
I don't get it.

Whywould you do this ?
To make teachers !

Shut up !
Oh. [ Whimpering ]

I'll tell you why.

To make technowarriors that
never get tired, never get hungry...

and never say "no."

Every army in the world
will be made up ofmy creations.

Imagine the confusion,
Gadget, huh ?

Imagine the perks.

Comprende ?

Yeah, I comprende.

No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

I comprendo.
Yo comprendo.

Conjugate the verb,
for pity's sake.

Pull the N.S.A. chip
before he butchers another language.

You're kidding, right ?
Okay. Yousee ?He's always kidding.

Ineverknow.
This timeno.

I want to make sure nobody else
can develop their own android.

Doit, oryou'll

Oh.
[ Chuckles, Grunts ]

"Newhead. "

Okay, I am not here
right now.

I am on the beach with dolphins,
and, oh, hi, look at this starfish.

I don't feel so good.

I'm sorry, Gadget. Good help
is so hard to fi nd these days.

Would you mind
ifI do the honors ?

Well, here goes.
Arrivederci. Ciao, ciao.

Good-bye, Mr. Chip.

Dump this idiotin thejunkyard.

Yes, boss.

[ Cackling ]
Oh, no, not that idiot. This one.

[ Grunts ]
Oh, I wish you'd be more specific.

There's an awful lot
ofidiots around here.

Okay, boss.

Hello ?John ? Anybody home ?
[Tires Squealing]

You sit back and enjoy
the ride, Penny. I'm driving. Ha-ha.

Remember, kids. I'm a professional car,
so don't try this at home.

Penny, where's your uncle ?
I thought he was with you.

[ Sighs ]
This is bad.

Come on, Penny. We gotta fi nd him.
There's something rotten in Riverton.

" Fast" and "Whoo, what was that ?"

Where's Scolex ?
I'll fi nd him. You drive.

Let's see whatyou can do,
Gadgetmobile, 'cause I feel
the need-- the need for speed.

[ Penny Giggling,

that Sanford Scolex
created an evil version
ofmy uncle to terrorize Riverton.

Is that true ?
Everyword ofit.
She's an amazing young woman.

She held up a mirror to my misguided
ways in the service of Mr. Scolex.

I'm sorry, Chief.

Here's the foot.
I didn't know any better.

Et tu, Sikes ?
