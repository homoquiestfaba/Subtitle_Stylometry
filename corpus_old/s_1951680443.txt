HOUSTON LEUKEMIA
CENTER

What happened?
Nothing.

When I was your age
I was captain!

I know.

I'm tired. That's enough.

His father was a tent maker. He was born
in Naishapur, Iran on May 18, 1048.

At age twelve,
he lost his father.

From that moment, his friend Darya
was the only person

other than his mother,
whom he could lean on.

Hassan and Omar slowly became
close friends.

Hassan's father treated Omar
like his own son.

With Daya, their friendship
grew stronger.

Although the three of
them were inseparable,

Omar held a very special place
in his heart for Darya.

As they grew older, their friendship was
viewed differently by the public.

YEARS LATER

Hassan and Omar did not realize at the time

how their friendship with a slave girl
would impact their lives.

Eat.

You cannot save the boy
by starving.

Mother, let us pray for Nader.

If her son dies,

I'll be devastated
for my sister, Shahin.

Her heart is with the Iran of the past,

but Mansour only thinks
about the future.

Kamran is not going.

We must show this to
grandfather.

It's important for him to know that
we still remember Omar.

Both Hassan and Omar searched
and searched...

...but didn't find her.

Neither would ever
get over their love for her.

For Hassan, love
was no longer important.

The only thing left fo him was his
faith in God and his religion.

Persia came under the control of
Muslim Turks known as Seljuks.

Malikshah became the new
leader of the Seljuks.

The root of Seljuk power was granted
by the religion of Islam.

This alarmed the European
Byzantines...

who came to the regio spreading
Christianity and their own authority.

Hello Shahin

Hello Cyrus

I miss you very much.

I miss you too.

How's Nader?

He's so pale!

Mother is very worried.

What about his
white blood cell count?

I have to go back
to the hospital.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Gradually, Hassan and Omar were
going their separate ways.

The hearts of two lovers can
never be apart from one another.

That's how Darya's love found its
way back to Omar.

As Malikshah prepared to defend
against advancing Christian armies,

a radical Islamic group threatened to
unseat him from within his Empire.

Hope and love died inside Omar
when he could not find Darya.

Poor Shahin,
I feel very badly for her.

Mansour is so headstrong.

Kamran is the Keeper now.

Shahin has not forgotten.

We must not
upset your father.

It would kill his spirit.

Try calling them again
tomorrow.

Shahin, don't worry.
I've got a visa for England.

Give me her address
and telephone.
