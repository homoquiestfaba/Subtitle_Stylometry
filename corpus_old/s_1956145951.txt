(RUMBLING, RATTLING)

Right turn.

(RATTLING, CREAKING)

JOE: We show you ballooning,
not turning.

JOE:

Okay, Neil.

Kid's a good engineer.

But he's distracted.

JOE: He got home, Chuck.
He bounced off the atmosphere

and still figured out
how to get home.

Is that a kite?

Does that fly in the sky?

How?

â™ª I see the Moon

â™ª The Moon sees me

â™ª Down through the leaves

â™ª Of the old oak tree

â™ª Please let the light

â™ª That shines on me

â™ª Shine on the one I love.

NEIL:
<i>Maybe I should talk</i>

MAN (OVER PHONE):
Who?

NEIL:
Dr. Harold Johns.

He developed a procedure
in Saskatchewan.

(OVER PHONE):
So you'd go to Canada?

NEIL: I guess I would
take some time off.

(OVER PHONE): Why don't you
talk to the hospital?

See if the tumor might be...
I spoke to them already.

(OVER PHONE):
I'm sorry, Neil.

I wish I had more to offer.

NEIL:
That's okay, Jack.

Uh, appreciate it.

Of course.
Give my love to June.

You got it.
Okay.

Bye, now.
Bye.

(HANGS UP PHONE)

NEIL: Now, who made that?
You or Grace?

JOE:
Grace did.

I'll take it, then.

Thank you.
Thank you.

JOE:
Dick Day called from Houston.

He was asking after you.

That about Gemini?

They're looking for pilots

with a solid background
in engineering.

(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

Well, maybe once Karen
starts feeling better.

Just, you know, I wouldn't want
to move her until then.

Well, it would be nice
to keep you around.

JOE: Enjoy the casserole.
NEIL: Thank you.

JOE:
You're welcome.

Joe.

Hey, Jan.

You, uh, hanging in?

Oh, you know.

It's nice of you to come by.

Of course.

I thought I might go to work.

Okay.

JOE: They're gonna use
VTOL technology.

BUTCH: They won't even
have figured out

how to get there yet. I'm not
gonna waste my time on...

Morning.

Neil.

You can take a few days off,
you know.

I know.

I'm just getting up to speed on
the new delta wing in the UK.

Bikle canceled the trip.

He wants you focused
on writing up

the pilot report
from your last flight.

Am I grounded, Joe?

Write up the report
on the bounce, okay?

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER IN OFFICE)


MAN (IN OTHER ROOM):
Thank you, sir.

â™ª

(QUIET, INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Civilian?

Yeah.
Yeah. Me, too.

Elliot.

Neil.

Tough morning, huh?

I barely lasted two minutes
in that ice bath.

Course, I suppose
NASA's more interested

in the psychological reaction.

Well...

I think I made it pretty clear
that I thought it was cold.

(ELLIOT LAUGHS)
(DOOR OPENS)

Armstrong.

Good luck.
You, too.

Another egghead.

BOB GILRUTH:
<i>Neil, we've been chatting</i>

<i>with candidates
about the program.</i>

As you know, our decision
to forgo direct ascent

in favor of a lunar orbit
rendezvous approach

to the eventual Moon mission

has had a major impact
on Gemini.

Do you have any thoughts
on that decision?

Well, even considering
von Braun's initial criticism,

it seems that the payload saved

by parking the primary vehicle
in orbit

and sending a smaller ship down
to the lunar surface

is well worth
the resulting challenges.

What do you see
as the challenges?

NEIL:
Cislunar navigation, for one.

And rendezvous and docking.

Why do you think
space flight's important?

I had a few, uh,
opportunities in the X-15

to observe the atmosphere.

It was so thin,
such a small part of the Earth,

you could barely see it at all.

And when you're down here
in the crowd

and you look up, it...
it looks pretty big,

and you don't think
about it too much.

But when you get
a different vantage point,

it changes your perspective.

I don't know what
space exploration will uncover,

but I don't think
it'll be exploration

just for the sake
of exploration.

I think it'll be more the fact
that it allows us to see things

that maybe we should have seen
a long time ago

but just haven't been able to
until now.

Does anyone have anything else?
MAN: Yeah.

Neil, I was sorry to hear
about your daughter.

I'm sorry, is there a question?

Um, what I...
what I mean is, uh,

do you think
it will have an effect?

I think it would be
unreasonable to assume

that it wouldn't have
some effect.

BOB:
All right, Neil.

Thank you. That's fine.

Thank you.

Thank you for your time.

(PHONE RINGS)

Hello?

Yeah, sure. Neil.

Hello?

Can I go play outside?

Yeah. (MUTTERS)

Yes, sir.

Thank you, sir.

(JANET HANGS UP PHONE)

I got it.

It's a fresh start.

Are you sure?

Yeah.

(WHISPERS): Hey.
(KISSES)

It'll be an adventure.

MALE NARRATOR:
<i>Since the time of Jules Verne,</i>

<i>man has imagined
traveling to the Moon.</i>

<i>The old idea of how to get
to the Moon</i>

<i>was to send one spacecraft
all the way there and back.</i>

<i>However, NASA engineers have
developed a modern approach</i>

<i>where one rocket
contains several ships</i>

<i>that will make the journey
together.</i>

<i>Just as Columbus took a rowboat</i>

<i>from the</i> Santa MarÃ­a
<i>to the shore of the New World,</i>

<i>the astronauts will take
a smaller spacecraft</i>

<i>from the mother ship
down to the lunar surface.</i>

<i>When it's time to return,</i>

<i>the smaller craft will lift off
from the surface</i>

<i>and dock with the mother ship,</i>

<i>which will then power the crew
back to Earth.</i>

<i>Thus, thanks to
the brilliant minds of NASA,</i>

<i>the age-old dream of going
to the Moon</i>

<i>will soon be achieved.</i>

â™ª

DEKE SLAYTON:
<i>Sputnik, Sputnik 2,</i>

Vostok, Gagarin.

The Soviets have beaten us

at every single major
space accomplishment.

Our program couldn't compete.

So we've chosen to focus
on a job so difficult,

requiring so many
technological developments,

that the Russians are gonna
have to start from scratch.

As will we.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

Hi.

Hi.
I'm Pat.

Got here about a week
before you,

so welcome to the neighborhood.

Oh, that's so nice of you.

(SIGHS) Well, it's...
I'm Janet.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

DEKE:
So, instead of here, we go...

Hey.

Here.

That's to scale. Check it.

PAT: That's my husband, Ed,
and that's Eddie Junior.

I don't know where Bonnie is.
(ED GRUNTS PLAYFULLY)

You've got two?
I do.

I see...
Is this your first one?

Oh, no, no.

We've got a boy, Rick.

PAT:
How old is he?

He's five and a half.

Oh, well, we should get them
together.

DEKE:
If we want to get this done,

we need to prove that two ships

can find each other in orbit
and dock without crashing.

That's the primary mission
of Project Gemini.

When we think you're ready,

each of you will be assigned
a flight with a specific task.

Only after we master
all these tasks

do we move on to Apollo,

consider trying to land
on the Moon.

It's nice to meet you.
And you, Pat.

Bye.
Bye.

PAT: Eddie, you put that down.
DEKE: <i>Gus.</i>

PAT:
Eddie Junior, don't you dare...

You got anything to add?

Just do your job.

MAN:
Yes, sir.

Almost to scale.

GUS:
The Multi-Axis Trainer

was designed to replicate
roll coupling on three axes,

the kind you might
encounter in space.

The challenge
is to stabilize the machine

before you pass out.

First victim, Armstrong.

(DOOR CLOSES)

(WRITING ON CHALKBOARD)

Gentlemen, welcome
to Basic Rocket Physics.

We'll just be covering
the first chapter tonight.

When using a multi-stage
launch vehicle,

it's necessary to determine

what the right sizing is
of those stages.

â™ª

â™ª

Hi.
Hi.

You okay?

Yeah.

(CLEARS THROAT) Just thinking
about this lecture.

It's kind of neat.

What's neat about it?

Well, it was about how
to rendezvous with the Agena.

If you thrust,
it-it actually slows you down,

because it puts you
into a higher orbit,

so you have to reduce thrust

and drop into a lower orbit
in order to catch up.

It's-it's backwards from what
they teach you as a pilot,

but if you work the math,
it-it-it follows.

It's kind of neat.

Yeah.

What's funny?

No, it's not funny.
It's just...

It's kind of neat.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

(LES BAXTER'S

Do you remember this?

Yeah.

I'm surprised
that you remember it.

ED JUNIOR:
Let's see. I want to make ten.

(LAUGHTER)
ELLIOT: Before you panic...

ED:
There we go.

ELLIOT:
Great. Thank you.

JANET:
Thank you for having us.

PAT: It's a pleasure.
(PIANO PLAYS DISCORDANT NOTES)

Carrie.
(PLAYING STOPS, GIRL LAUGHS)

Here you go.
Would you like some salad?

Thank you.
That's a lovely piano, Pat.

Do you play?
Bonnie's taking lessons.

Mm.
JANET: Well, perhaps we'll sing

for our supper.

Neil plays piano?

Neil knows all kinds
of show tunes.

Janet.
Oh, come on.

He was musical director
at his fraternity in college.

Honey.
Yeah, he wrote the musical

for the all-student revue.

I didn't write the music.
Yeah, you did.

No, I... We used music
from Gilbert and Sullivan.

JANET:
Well, he wrote all new lyrics.

"The Land of Egelloc."

It was quite funny.

"The Land of Egelloc"?

Egelloc.
JANET: Mm-hmm.

You've never heard of it?

I-I haven't.

NEIL: Oh, I'm surprised.
Uh, uh, it's a distant land,

but, uh, it's a magical place.

It's "college"
spelled backwards.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Seriously?

Yep.


You're, uh,
backup on Five, huh?

Yeah.
Well, don't worry.

You'll get
your own mission soon.

How's training going on Four?

It's good.

I think we're close on E.V.A.

First man to walk in space.

That'd be something, huh?
Yeah.

Well, you know the walking's
the easy part.

It's getting back inside that's tough.
Mm.

(CHILDREN SHOUTING PLAYFULLY)
It'd be a hell of a ride

to come back
with my tail hanging out.

NEIL:
Oh, I think McDivitt

will cut the cord
before that ever happens.

ED: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You
throttle back there, Armstrong.

(LAUGHING)
PAT: Ed!

Yeah?
Phone for you.

Yeah, who is it?
It's Deke.

Okay, hang on.

ELLIOT: I think that's
Castor and Pollux.


I was testing you,
and you passed.

I thought about
letting it fly, but...

Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)
Yeah.

ED: Uh, no, uh,
let me turn it on right now.

Hey, guys.

NEWSCASTER (OVER TV):
...with a Soviet pressure suit,

we're told, that was designed
for the lunar surface.

ED: I'll call you back.
(OVER TV): This is, of course,

mankind's first E.V.A.,

or extravehicular activity.
(HANGS UP PHONE)

Within the American
space program,

E.V.A. is seen as one
of the crucial tests

the astronauts must master
if they are to successfully

carry out their mission
to the Moon.

Astronaut Ed White
was scheduled

to perform the first E.V.A.

during Gemini 4.
(BANGS TABLE)

So this is yet another
major victory

for the Soviet Union
in the Space Race.

(REPORTER SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

(QUIET, INDISTINCT CHATTER)

MAN:
Check valves are clear.

MAN 2:
Okay. I'll get on the edge.

We got it from here.
Thanks.

Thanks, Elliot.

ELLIOT:
<i>Eight days up there.</i>

To be honest, I'm kind of glad
we didn't get this one.

NEIL: Hope they don't
kill each other.

At least it'd be quieter
around here.

(NEIL SNICKERS)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

DEKE:
Neil.

Go ahead.

Neil Armstrong,
our backup commander.

Buzz Aldrin.

Roger Chaffee.

Couple of greenhorns
from third group.

They'll be at blockhouse
for launch.

Listen, can I speak to you
for a minute?

Fellas.

DEKE: We're putting you
in command of Gemini 8.

Dave Scott is gonna be
your pilot.

We get the Agena back online,

you're probably gonna be
the first to dock.

Don't worry about Elliot.

We'll put that brain
of his to work.

We've got a big E.V.A.
planned for Eight.

Dave's a workhorse.

Yes, sir.

I'll talk to you later today.
Thank you.

Oh, my eye!

My eye!

ED JUNIOR:
Mr. Armstrong.

PAT:
When did you start swimming?

JANET:
I don't remember exactly.

I think school.
In high school?

Yeah, and we had a...
we, uh...

like, a summer house
in northern Wisconsin,

and I just used to go
to the lake and, uh, fish.

And I just used to swim
for miles and miles.

I've-I've always loved it.
(CHILDREN SHOUTING PLAYFULLY)

(CHILDREN LAUGHING)
PAT: Nothing quite compares

to your terrible life.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Oh...

You got it coming.

It's the longest bridge
in the world, but there's no...

NEIL: It's the second-largest
suspension bridge in the world,

but these cables are the longest...
(KNOCKING)

Hey, Ed.
Oh, hi.

Uh, can I speak with Neil?

Yeah, sure.
Why don't you come on in?

You're soaked.

No, I'll-I'll...
I'll wait here.

Thanks.

NEIL:
You could fly under there.

RICK: That would hurt
if you jumped under it.

NEIL: What's that?
RICK: That would hurt

if you jumped over it.

Yeah.

Uh, here are the sky pieces.

JANET:
Neil, Ed's outside.

NEIL:
Okay.

Excuse me, son.

Hi.

You want to come in?

Some bad news about Elliot.

No, I know. Deke told me
he bumped him, but with...

Neil, Elliot and Charlie
were flying

into St. Louis this morning.

Their T-38 crashed on approach.

Oh.

There was a lot of fog.

(RAIN PATTERING ON ROOF)

RICK: So, did you really fly
under that bridge?

Was it fun?

Were you scared?

JANET:
Ricky. Honey.

Why don't you go and get your
homework so I can check it?

RICK:
Yes, ma'am.

Who was it?

(QUIET, INDISTINCT CHATTER)

GUS: Shit.
How the hell did this happen?

(GRUNTS QUIETLY)

Cernan told me cloud cover
was down to 500 feet.

Probably never
saw the building.

Clearly, the error
was the approach.

He was coming in too slow
to reach the runway.

What?

You know Deke had
his doubts about him.

That's why he moved Elliot
off Eight.

Deke gave Elliot
his own command.

Elliot wasn't
aggressive enough.

You of all people
have to know that.

No, I don't.

I didn't investigate the crash.

I didn't study
the flight trajectory.

And I wasn't the one
flying the plane.

So I wouldn't pretend
to know anything.

We'll never be
a hundred percent sure.

(QUIET, INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(CHILDREN SQUEALING
AND SHOUTING PLAYFULLY)

(CHATTER CONTINUES)

(QUIET CHATTER CONTINUES)

Can we go?

Uh... uh, not right now.

I want to help Marilyn
clear all this up.

I don't want to have her do it
after we're gone.

Neil?

(CAR DOOR CLOSES,
ENGINE STARTS)

(TIRES SQUEALING)

I'm sorry.

I hate to be a bother.

PAT: Oh, Jan, it's no bother.
ED: Oh, Jan.

ED:
Yeah, no.

JANET:
Neil's, uh...

There was a year
when we were at Edwards...

Four pilots died.

We got good at funerals
that year.


We haven't been to one
in a while.

Does he ever talk to you
about Karen, Ed?

Not really. No.

Does he talk to you about her?

No.

Never.

â™ª

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

â™ª

Hey, buddy.

You know,
you should be with Jan.

Neil, you should be playing
with your kids.

You know, putting them
into bed.

Times like these...
Do you think I'm standing

out here in the backyard

'cause I want to talk
to somebody, Ed?

I'm sorry?

Do you think I left there

'cause I want to talk

(INDISTINCT SHOUTS)

â™ª You know, the man

â™ª Whitey's on the Moon
WOMAN: Right on!

â™ª No hot water,
no toilets, no lights â™ª

â™ª But Whitey's on the Moon
MAN: <i>Uh-huh!</i>

â™ª I wonder why he's uppin' me â™ª
WOMAN: <i>Come on, now!</i>

â™ª 'Cause Whitey's on the Moon? â™ª
<i>Yeah!</i>

â™ª Well, I was already giving
him, like, 50 a week and, uh â™ª

â™ª Whitey's on the Moon...

Jesus, that's a big mother.
It's a political rush job.

Congress wouldn't fund us
to come in second.

Why else would NASA
be sending a rocket

that's had one issue
after another to the Moon?

Thanks for the insight, Buzz.

(DRUMBEAT FROM
"WHITEY ON THE MOON" CONTINUES)

Always a pleasure with you.

Oh, it doesn't matter.
He's not in the lunar lottery.

And you are?

Well, the only guys
they let on the LLTV

since Neil's accident
are ones that might land.

So you think you're going
to the Moon?

Well, it's been up for grabs
since Gus died.

I'm just saying
what you're thinking.

(DRUMBEAT AND RHYTHMIC

Well, maybe you shouldn't.

MAN (OVER SPEAKERS):
Apollo 8 clearing the VAB

WOMAN: <i>Yeah!</i>

(SONG ENDS)

Hell of a rocket.

Yeah.

Everything stays on track,
11's gonna be the landing.

I talked to Bob.
Everyone's in agreement.

We'd like you to command.

Okay.

(TURNS OFF FAUCET)

WALTER CRONKITE:
<i>I can see a helicopter</i>

<i>vectoring that way.</i>

<i>It looks like a red dot</i>

with a long, long tail,
a long plume.

That's got to be
the spacecraft.

That has to be
Apollo 10 reentering.

And so the flight of Apollo 10

has performed the major
function of its mission.

It has proved, through
these daring three astronauts,

that, uh, all of the systems
work properly

and that there should be
no reason why man cannot,

perhaps as early as July,

land on that picked spot
on the Moon's equator.

These are sailors of the sky,

and what, uh,
we've seen and heard today

make the great ocean voyages
of the earthbound

seem... well,
earthbound indeed.

For as the poet wrote,
the crew of Apollo 10

has "slipped
the surly bonds of Earth"

and carried us over
into tomorrow.

In the past few hours,

man has come closer to the Moon
than ever in his history.

There were those
terrifying moments when...

Mom, what's wrong?

Hmm?
What's wrong?

Nothing, honey.

Your dad's going to the Moon.

Okay.

Can I go outside?

Sure.

(RUNNING STEPS)

(CLEARS THROAT)
Uh, we're here today

to talk about
the forthcoming flight.

But we're able to talk
about it because of, uh...

previous flights.

Every flight
took on new objectives

and left us with very few
additions to be completed.

We're very grateful to those
people who made it possible

for us to be here today.

DEKE: All right,
we'll take some questions now.

Jim.

Neil, when you learned you were
going to command this flight,

were you surprised?
Overjoyed?

I was pleased.
Okay, but how would you compare

this feeling
to winning an automobile

or being selected
as an astronaut?

I was pleased.

Brian.
Neil, if it does turn out,

you'll go down in history.

What kind of thoughts
do you have about that

when the thought hits you, uh,

"Gosh, suppose
that flight's successful..."

We're planning on that flight
being successful.

BRIAN:
Uh, I-I just meant,

how you feel about...
being a part of history.

I think I can shed
some light here.

It's a responsibility...

but it's exciting
to be the first.

Even my wife is excited.

She keeps slipping....
jewelry into my PPK.

(LAUGHTER)
You're planning on taking some of her jewelry

to the Moon, Buzz?
Sure.

Wh-What fella wouldn't want

to give his wife
bragging rights?

(LAUGHTER)
Neil, will you take anything?

Uh, if I had a choice,
I'd take more fuel.

(SCATTERED LAUGHING)
DEKE: All right, next question.

I thought you
were gonna talk to the boys.

What did you want me to say?

What do you want to say?

You're the one
that's going away.

Well, it's too late now.
They're asleep.

No, they're not, Neil.

You know they're not.

Why can't you talk to them?
(CLOSES ZIPPER)

What are you doing?

Uh... I'm packing.

No.

You're just killing time
until you can get in the car.

Okay.
Okay.

Neil, I need you
to talk to the boys.

Can you hear me?

I need you to talk to the boys.
What are you doing?

Stop.

I'm going to work.
Well, just stop it.

Just stop... just stop packing!


What are the chances
you're not coming back?

Hmm? What are the chances

this is the last time
the boys are gonna see you?

Well, I can't give you
an exact number.

I don't want
a fucking number, Neil!

It's not zero, is it?

Is it?

No.

No. It's not.

Pat doesn't have a husband.

Those kids, they don't
have a father anymore.

Do you understand
what that means?

What are the chances
that's gonna be Ricky and Mark?

And I... I can't tell them

that their dad spent
the last few minutes

packing his briefcase!

You're gonna sit 'em down,
both of them,

and you're gonna prepare them
for the fact

that you might not
ever come home.

You're doing that.

You.

Not me.

I'm done.

So you better start thinking
about what you're gonna say.


Jimmy asked
what you're gonna say

when you get onto the Moon.

Well, we're not sure
we're gonna get onto the Moon.

Uh... a lot of things
have to go right

before that happens.

How long will you be gone?

Um... well,
we launch in ten days,

we'll be up for eight, and then
about a month in quarantine.

What's quarantine?

We'll... be in isolation.

Uh, to protect
in case we, uh...

carry any diseases
from the lunar surface

or... something of that nature.

It's not likely,
but it's a precaution.

So you won't be here
for my swim meet?

(SMACKS LIPS)

No.

Sorry.

Does anyone have
any other questions?

Do you think
you're coming back?

We have real confidence
in the mission.

And, uh, there are some risks,

but we have every intention
of coming back.

But you might not.

(SMACKS LIPS)

That's right.

Okay.

Okay. Time for bed.

it's hard not to think back

our 35th president gave
just seven short years ago.

KENNEDY: If this capsule
history of our progress

teaches us anything,
it is that man,

in his quest for knowledge
and progress,

is determined
and cannot be deterred.

But why, some say, the Moon?

Why choose this as our goal?

why climb the highest mountain?

Why, 35 years ago,
fly the Atlantic?

Why does Rice play Texas?

We choose to go to the Moon.

We choose to go to the Moon...
