MAN: Ree?

Ree?

Wake up, baby.

They wanna hear you sing.

You wanna sing?

Yes, please.

All right.

(PEOPLE LAUGHING, CHATTERING)

Clarence, Ella's
looking for you.

Wait here, Ree.

I'll be right back.
Okay.

WOMAN 1: They butchered my essay.
Took all the politics out.

Can you believe that?

WOMAN 2: Communism is
absolutely for the Negro.

How else are we gonna have
everything we ever wanted?

Now, how does a man with one eye
play like he has four hands?

You been practicing?

Yes, Mr. Tatum.

She could hit
three octaves easy.

MAN 1: You know, you the finest
looking cat here, right?

Nigger, I know that.

What else you got?

Hey, Ree.

Hey, Uncle Sam.

MAN 2: No more
segregated clubs for me.

I'm not walking through no one's
kitchen to get to the stage.

WOMAN: I said to them, "I'm so happy
to be performing in England,

"but just remember there's only
one Heaven, one Earth

"and one queen.

"Me. Dinah Washington."

"That Elizabeth on y'alls throne
is an imposter."

You didn't.
Oh, yes, I did.

And I made 'em bow before me.

Well, look out, y'all.

The entertainer is here.

Hi.

MAN 1: He said he wanted
a race novel.

MAN 2: Sure, he
desegregated the army.

But he didn't do a damn thing
after that.

Hi, Aunt Ella. Uncle Duke.

Hey.

You ready, Ree?
Come on.

Excuse me? Everyone.

Everyone.
(PIANO MUSIC STOPS)

For those of you visiting my
home for the first time,

this is my daughter, Aretha.

She'd like to sing
a little something for you.

What would you
like to sing, Ree?

How old is she?

She's 10,

but her voice is
going on 30, honey.

CL: Aretha would
like to perform

<i>My Baby Likes to Bebop.</i>

Damn!

I was gonna record that
on my next album.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Can we do a duet?

(PIANO PLAYING)

Now I'm tall as a treetop</i>

<i>And just to end like new</i>

<i>I find the melody's dead</i>

<i>'Cause my baby
likes to bebop</i>

<i>And I love to bebop too</i>


<i>I love to bebop too</i>

MAN: Sing, baby!


<i>How I love to bebop too</i>

<i>I saw old Uncle Ned
do a dance and a flip-flop</i>

<i>He jumped like
the hepcats do</i>

<i>I flipped my lid
when he said</i>

<i>"My baby likes to bebop"</i>

<i>And boy...</i>


<i>And I like to bebop too</i>

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Back to bed with you.

(SINGING ALONG) <i>Oh, when the saints

Those white folks don't know
what to do with her.

GIRL: Yeah, Grandma!

Sock it to 'em!
Sock it to 'em!

(MUFFLED MUSIC)

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Momma's here!

Momma!
(LAUGHS, EXCLAIMS)

God! Babe,
I missed you so much.

BOY: Hi! Momma!

Mommy!

My babies!

My precious!

(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

Let's go!
BOY: Bye, Grandma!

Come on, baby!
GIRL: Let's go in the car!

BARBARA: (SINGING) <i>In everything
that's light and gay</i>

<i>I'll always think of you
that way</i>

<i>I'll find you
in the morning sun</i>

<i>And even when
the night is new</i>

<i>I'll be looking

<i>But I'll be seeing</i>

<i>You</i>


Sing another one, Momma!

Oh, Ree, that's
the third song now.

Please?

No, I want to talk.

Please?
Oh, God...

Oh...
Oh, all right.

What if I sing-talk?

<i>How is Aretha doing?</i>

<i>Aretha's doing all right</i>

<i>Just all right?</i>

<i>What about church?</i>

<i>We praising
the Lord, Momma!</i>

<i>Praising the Lord!</i>

<i>- Praising!
Praising!</i>

<i>- Praising the Lord!
Praising the Lord!</i>

<i>All day long</i>


You still singing
at the Saturday night parties?

Yeah.

Mm. Don't say "yeah."

"Yeah" is common.
Say "yes."

Yes.

You enjoy it?

Yeah. Yes.
(CHUCKLES)

Look at me, Ree.

If you ever
don't want to sing, don't.

I love singing.

No, I know. I know.

Your daddy doesn't
own your voice, Ree.

Nobody does but God.

And you don't ever
have to fear any man.

You understand?

You are so worthy, Ree.

Don't you ever let anybody
tell you otherwise.

Yes, Momma.

(REE SOBBING)

Oh, Ree, don't cry.

Come on, I'll see you
for your birthday.

Three weeks is a long time.

I know, but I am
always with you.

Even when I'm not there.

Okay? (SMOOCHES)

Go.

CL:
Ree, get back here!

Ree!

Goodbye!

Bye, Momma!

<i>We're marching</i>

CONGREGATION: <i>We're marching
Marching up to Zion</i>

<i>That beautiful</i>

<i>That beautiful</i>

<i>City of Zion</i>

Ree?

Ree?

I'm the oldest. I should be
in the front of the line.

Hush.

We have nothing
to fear, church.

'Cause what is the white man
compared to God?

(CONGREGATION ACKNOWLEDGING,
APPLAUDING)

What is any law,
any injustice

compared to the power
of our Lord?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

That's right!

from the den like Daniel.

And Daniel went into
that lion's den.

Daniel went into
that lion's den.

Yes, Jesus!

Not yelling

nor fussing.

Not crying!

Not complaining!
No!

Praising the Lord!

Yeah!

'Cause he knew

the Lord was with him.

He feared no man!

Can you hear me, church?

I wish somebody would pray
with me 'cause He will!

He will!

He will!
He will!

He will shut the jaws
of segregation,

and any man, person

or institution
that would dare

stand against us.

He took us from slavery,

he took us from
the valley of reconstruction.

Freedom!

ALL: Freedom!

Freedom!
ALL: Freedom!

Freedom!
ALL: Freedom!

Freedom now!
Praise Him! Praise Him!

Preach, Daddy, preach!

Hallelujah.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Hey? Ree?
Ree!

How come you're
not singing tonight?

Daddy didn't ask me to.

What's your doll's name?

Dee.

That's a pretty name.

You're pretty, too.

What's your boyfriend's name?

I don't have a boyfriend.

I can be your boyfriend.

Would you like that?

We'll have fun.


<i>Luck wrong</i>

Come on, Ree!

I don't want to.

Ree, I will beat your behind.

What are you doing?

I don't care if you beat me.

I don't want my hair done.

Don't you wanna look pretty
for church tomorrow?

No!

Y'all wait
in the living room.

Come on.

Don't sweat out all my work.
That's gotta last you all week!

Sit down.

You wanna tell me
what's wrong?

Ree-Ree?

I know you don't
wanna tell me,

but you can always
tell the Lord, Ree.

He loves you,
no matter what.


(<i>HOW FAR AM I FROM CANAAN?</i>
PLAYING ON RECORD)

<i>I am standing</i>

<i>On the Jordan</i>

<i>Gazing across</i>

<i>Thy stormy tide</i>

You're supposed to be
in bed, Ree.

<i>There I'll rest
my every burden</i>

Come, come
and join me for a while.

<i>Till all doubts and fears</i>

<i>Lord, subside
Whoa, yes</i>

What if I wasn't here?

What do you mean by that?

I don't know.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello?

CL: See how nicely
their voices are blending?

They let Sam
take the proper lead.

Too many members of our choir
try to stand out

instead of supporting
the soloist.

Clarence?

Come to the phone.

Play this next.
Okay.

Right back.

MAMA FRANKLIN: Barbara's dead.

CL: How?

MAMA FRANKLIN: Heart attack.

CL: (STUTTERS) I'll tell them
in the morning, Mama.

No. No, you cannot
wait till tomorrow

to tell them
their momma is dead.

(GLASS SHATTERS)

No. No.

Ree?

Ree?


I'm sorry, baby.

Let's go inside.

(ALL SINGING)
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

<i>Happy birthday

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

Come on now, Ree.

She just miss her momma.

They all missin' her,

but how long
she gonna keep silent?

Goin' on three weeks.
She gotta...

She just needs a little time.
That's all.

Ree?

Miss Clara made you this
beautiful cake,

and Reverend James
came especially for you.

What do you say, Ree?

Do you say, "Thank you"?

Do you say something?
(POUNDS TABLE)

Make a wish, Ree.


I can't do this.

MAMA FRANKLIN: Come on.
Momma. Momma.

Come on, baby. It's all right.
Momma. Momma.

It's all right. Come on, baby.
Momma.

JAMES: (SINGING)
<i>Do not carry</i>

<i>Everything</i>

<i>To God in prayer</i>

Why are you hiding
over there?

Come on over here
and get your lesson.

You know this one.

Tell you what,
I'll be the choir

and you play the lead.

Three, four...

Ree is helping me with my
arrangement.

I see.

Has she spoken to you?

gotten that far</i>

Do you think you can
stay silent forever, Ree?

Hmm?
(PIANO PLAYING STOPS)

Look at me.

We must honor the gifts
that God has given us, Ree.

You will be singing
in church tomorrow.

James, can you prepare her?

(CLEARS THROAT)
Yes, sir.

Thank you.

(JAMES CLEARS THROAT)

Don't let nothin' come between you
and your music, Ree.

Music will save your life.

CL: <i>God holds our hand.</i>

(CONGREGATION CLAMORING)
Through Him, we can do anything!

He's a catcher!

A dream catcher!

Amen!

ALL: Amen.
CL: Amen.

And now,

my daughter, Aretha,
will bless us with song.

I wonder,
do you feel all right?

ALL: Yes!

CL: I said,
do you feel all right?

ALL: Yes!

Amen.

I'm ecstatic
to be able to report to you

that the day before yesterday,
we filled up the jail.

We have already won a victory
here in Birmingham.

Amen!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
CL: Due, in no small part

to the valiant work
of our leader.

A man whom I feel honored
to call my friend.

The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

All right! Yes, sir!

Yes, sir!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Come on! Somebody!

Some people

think that we are crazy

for taking on this fight.

(CONGREGATION EXCLAIMS)

But the forces against us
are strong

and they are determined
to stop us.

But we are just
as determined to go on!

(CONGREGATION CLAMORING)

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR:
Non-violently,

with love.

As long as it takes
to win our freedom.

Yes!

And Jesus is here with us
every single step of the way.

Amen!

Yes, sir!

Uncle Martin...

Now don't call me
Uncle Martin anymore.

You make me feel old, that's the problem.
I want to march.

Don't look at me like I'm still a child.
I'm not afraid.

Oh, you're not?
No.

Well, damn.

Then you need to be
leadin' this movement

and teaching me how to not be
terrified of these crazy white folks.

ARETHA: Martin...

Why do you want to march?

After all this time
traveling with you,

after all the horror
we've seen,

what kind of question
is that?

Are you runnin'
from your daddy?

No.

So, you tell him
you wanna march?

I don't have to.

It's my decision.
I'm a grown woman, remember?

orphan your kids now? Hmm?

Are you?
No.

But you're doing it anyway.

Because I have to.

And I don't?
Ree...

Singing for the movement

and sending people into battle
with a song is not enough anymore.

I need to be with them.

You have a good talk?

Yes.

It was a good talk.

Brother, come on.

She's restless, I can tell.

I don't know if it's restless.

She just wants to do more.

What kind of more?

I'll be there in a minute.

Momma!

Clarence! Eddie!

CHILDREN: Momma! Momma! Momma!

My babies!


Are you all right, baby?

(CRYING)
Clarence, you go in your room and wait for me.

Come here. It's all right, baby,
it's all right. Come on. Come on.

It's all right.
It's all right.

Every time I come back,
they want me less.

That's not true.

They talk about you
all the time.

Every night, I show 'em
where you are on the map.

One cookie.

(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)

Fix your face now.

This party is for y'all.

CL: How are you, Mama?

God is good.

All the time.

Amen.

Let's eat.
I'm starving.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

ERMA: So, where y'all headed?

We go to Tennessee, then to Georgia,
then to North Carolina,

and then back to Alabama,
I think.

Damn. Martin's tour's
busier than Daddy's.

Erma, sometimes we hit
two states in one day.

What was that story
about Aunt Mahalia not paying you?

She said I would receive
my reward in Heaven.


ARETHA: Oh.

No, Ree. Uh-uh.


Uh-uh-uh-uh...

Smokey...
Hey, hey, hey.

He's got some news, Ree.

I heard you're
cuttin' a record.

Yeah, with Berry
over at Motown.

They got some
sweet sounds, Ree.

They're signing a bunch of folks
in the neighborhood.

Listen, we are trying to put
Detroit on the map.

You gotta be a part of it.

I would love that.
Yeah?

Cecil, let me talk
to Daddy about it.

Don't bring it up
until I say.

You know what?
Let's let Berry talk to him.

CECIL:
Better yet, his sister.

She can talk ice
out of the devil's mouth.

What are you drinking?

Iced tea.

Just iced tea?

With a little bourbon.


Yeah, you look like
a bourbon girl.

How long are you in town for?

ARETHA: A week.

Then I return to Tennessee.

Well, then, I won't
waste any time.

I'd like to take you out.

I'd like you to take me out.

How about tonight?

Ree!

Come and help me
set this table.

Yes, to tonight.

Okay.

Excuse me a moment.

Reverend.

I put up with you coming
to my house all these years

'cause you were friends
with my friends.

But I don't want you
around here anymore.

May I give you
some counsel, Reverend?

Ephesians 6:4 says,
"Fathers,

"do not exasperate
your children.

"Instead, bring them up in the training
and the instruction of the Lord."

Are you serious?

You may wanna loosen
your grip on Aretha.

You know, every minister's
daughter I've ever known...

Nigger, you don't
wanna mess with me

or mine.

I got this.

I got it.

(UPBEAT JAZZ SONG PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER)

Take that off.

CL: Everyone! Everyone!

Please, please, gather around.

Aretha, will you
join me, please?

This party is not just

a homecoming.

It's also an announcement.

God is moving us on
to our next chapter.

I've been talking to a number
of record producers about Aretha.

There were many who were interested
in working with her.

Tell them what it is, Ree.

(CLEARS THROAT)

A plane ticket
to New York City.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Congratulations, Ree.

Thank you.

CL: This is it.

Wow.

CL: Excuse me?

I have a meeting with a John Hammond
of Columbia Records.

RECEPTIONIST: Sign in, please.

You ready?

I'm ready.

CL: I've always seen Aretha
as more than a gospel singer.

Well, clearly from her demo,
she's so much more.

CL: Stand up, Ree.

Turn around.

There can sometimes be
a lack of effortlessness

of the kind you find in a Lena Horne
or a Dorothy Dandridge.

But what Aretha lacks
in formal education,

she more than makes up
for in experience.

She has performed before every type
of crowd imaginable,

from small churches
to audiences of thousands.

You can sit down now, Ree.

I'm curious.

Who are your favorite artists?

Dinah Washington.

Ella Fitzgerald.

Hmm.
Sam Cooke.

All family friends.

Sam would very much
like Aretha

to sign with RCA.

Well, we can't have that.

Welcome

to Columbia Records.

Oh. (LAUGHS)

JOHN: <i>Prove yourself as a jazz artist,
and everything else will follow.</i>

ARETHA: <i>I understand.</i>

Wonderful.

(JOHN CLEARS THROAT)

<i>Are you ready, Aretha?</i>

Yes, Mr. Hammond.

<i>Wonderful.</i>

<i>The conductor will point at you
when he's ready for you to begin.</i>

(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

the positive</i>

<i>And eliminate the negative</i>

<i>And hang on
to the affirmative</i>

<i>But don't mess
with mister in-between</i>

She sounds wonderful,
doesn't she?

She does.

Like a Black Judy Garland.

<i>You got to spread joy
up to the maximum</i>

<i>And bring gloom down
to the minimum</i>

<i>And have faith
or pandemonium</i>

<i>Is liable to walk
upon the scene</i>

PRESENTER:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>the Village Vanguard is proud
to present Miss Aretha Franklin,</i>

<i>debuting her latest record,</i>
Unforgettable.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

We hope you enjoy
the show tonight.

I see an old family friend.
Dinah Washington is in the audience.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I'd like to sing a song in honor of
her great artistry and talent.

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>This bitter</i>

<i>Bitter...</i>

DINAH: Bitch!

Don't you ever sing
the Queen's songs

when the Queen
is in front of you!

What the hell
were you thinking?

I'm sorry.

You wanna take me on?

No.
Liar.

You wouldn't be here if you
wasn't trying to replace me

and every other bitch
out here singin'.

How many albums have you had?

Four.

And no hits.

(GLASS CLINKS, WINE SLOSHES)

You out here, but I can see you still that
little girl in your daddy's living room.

You're singin'
everything and anything.

<i>Shoop Shoop</i> one day,
<i>Skylark</i> the next,

and then some
Billie Holiday blues.

Girl, you're
all over the place.

What do you wanna sing?

I don't know.

You don't know?

I want hits.
I just want hits.

Girl, you need to let go of that
"up with the race"

Booker T Washington
proper Negro shit.

That's not you.

Your daddy likes to pretend that's who he is,
but that's not who he is either.

Child, y'all church folks are some
of the nastiest people out here.

Ray Charles told me
that the best sex he ever had

was when he was singin'
on the gospel circuit.

Honey, find the songs
that suit you. That move you.

Until you do that,
you ain't goin' nowhere.

Put some teabags on that.

Take the puffiness down.

How's Big Mama?

She's all right.

The kids?

They're good.

Child, you ever gonna tell us
who their daddy is?

Ree-Ree?

You wanna tell me what's wrong?
I can't.

(PHONE RINGING)

JOHN: No answer.

CL: Call her again.

Oh. There we go. (CHUCKLES)

I didn't know you were comin'
in today, Daddy.

CL: You are 68 minutes late.

Mr. Hammond
asked me to come in.

You've been skipping interviews
and gigs.

The demon is back.

Ree has a tendency
to indulge her pain.

Can we talk about this
somewhere else?

John. John.

It's important that you understand
that this behavior

is not a reflection
of her upbringing or her race.

JOHN: Well, I've worked
with Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday,

Aretha is a saint
in comparison.

She wasn't raised
in a whorehouse like them.

She was raised in a proper home
with every convenience and luxury.

But still, a darkness would
descend on her.

I called it the demon.

She'd lock herself away,
wouldn't speak, move,

just wallow in
whatever imaginary...

I...

You told me before we came out here
that you had it under control.

I have control.

You keep complaining
that you don't have any hits.

This is why you don't have any hits.
Acting like a trifling...

Apologize to Mr. Hammond.

No, there's no need
to apologize.

That is not why I don't have hits.
You don't pick good songs for me.

Sorry for being late,
Mr. Hammond.

It won't happen again.

I'm ready to record
when you are.

Please excuse me while I go to
the ladies' room.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

So, you gonna
come with us this weekend?

I have a gig.

We can go after your gig.

You work too hard.

Not according to my daddy.
(CHUCKLES)

Well, you need some fun.

Come with us.

Can you introduce me
to his friend?

I don't know him.

(MUSIC STOPS)
(PEOPLE EXCLAIM IN DISAPPOINTMENT)

(MUSIC RESUMES)
(PEOPLE CHEER)

You were supposed to
take me out in Detroit.

Yes, one of my singers ran into
a little trouble out of town,

so I had to take care of it.

I think my father said something to you
to make you reconsider.

you got goin' on in your head.


I know what you do.

It doesn't bother me.

I know it doesn't bother you.

You're rebelling
against your daddy.

I don't mind.

Listen, you wanna use me
for my body,

you can use me, baby.

You can wring me dry.

You and me,
we've been through it.

So we can skip all the flowers
and the promises, and the love bullshit

and just have some fun.

I like fun.

And we'll have plenty of it.

I want one thing from you.

What?

To hear you sing.

Just for me.

What will I get in return?

The best night of your life.

Taxi!

I want you to think about me
when you sing tomorrow.

You're not coming home
with me?

No.

What about
the best night of my life?

I didn't say
it would be tonight.

<i>There was a boy</i>

<i>A very strange
enchanted boy</i>

<i>They say he
wandered very far</i>

<i>Very far over land and sea</i>

<i>A little shy</i>

<i>Sad of eye</i>

<i>But very wise was he</i>

<i>That very day
He passed my way</i>

I'm sorry.

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

Would you like
to take a break, Aretha?

No.

I'll get it right this time.

JOHN: <i>Take 12.</i>

(SONG CONTINUES)

You have all my records.

You like them?

I bought them.

Which one you like best?

They've all got something.

Is this one your favorite?

Or this?

What are you doing?

Or this one?

Went to 64 on the charts.

You didn't even open this one.

You don't like them?

I didn't say that.

Then say it.

I won't be upset.

No one does.

First, I've listened
to all your albums.

Including this one.

More than once.

Secondly, I love music.

I take it seriously.

I managed my first artist
when I was 15.

Thirdly, what you
experienced yesterday,

17 takes on one song?

That happens to me
every time I hear you sing.

My brain gets all

muddled.

Well, first,

my apologies for putting you
through so much pain.

And secondly...
Uh-huh.

...you should have never told me
about your Achilles' heel.

On our first date...



Damn it.


Keep singing.

I didn't think you were comin'
home for two weeks.

I miss my babies.
(DOORBELL RINGS)

And y'all.

Who's that plate for?

Ted.

Sweet Jesus,
are you serious?

What are you thinking?
Please help me with Daddy.

No...
Help me.

Good Sunday, everybody.

What the hell is this?

You didn't tell them
I was coming?

I don't know what you think
you're doing here and I don't care.

Just leave. Now.

Aretha asked me to come

and Aretha can
ask me to leave.

I want him to stay.

This is my house.

Since when do you get to tell me
who gets to be in my house, Ree, huh?

I want you to
get to know him.

He's not what you think.

Are you pregnant again?

No!

We just wanna be together.

I love your daughter,
Reverend.

And I think she loves me.

I do.

No! No!
MAMA FRANKLIN: Oh, my Lord!

Ree...
MAMA FRANKLIN: Clarence! No!

Didn't I tell you
not to mess with me or mine?

Didn't I tell you?
Clarence!

Son, don't you let this man put your church
and your soul in jeopardy.

Reverend,

we have to figure this out.

I'm not going anywhere.

You can't see
through this hustler?

You're the greatest hustler
I ever seen.

Every night, she picks herself
apart because of you.

She thinks it's her hair,
her body, her voice.

She worries about failing you,
but it's your failure.

Get out! Just...

Daddy, I know
how busy you are.

You have so much
going on all the time.

Running a church,
the speakin' engagements,

managing Carolyn.

I know about your contract
at Horizon Records.

I was gonna tell you.

When?
When the damn album came out?

Nobody can tell you anything,
Ree. You're so jealous.

Jealous? Of you two?

You think you better than us?

That's exactly what she's saying.
No!

Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

You are not leaving
this family

for that piece of trash.

I need a change.

I wanna sing
what I wanna sing

and I wanna dress
like I want to dress.

And I want Ted to manage me.

He's not worth the shit
at the bottom of my shoe.

So that means that you think
I'm worth less than that.

After all we've been through.

After all that
I've done for you.

I have to do this, Daddy.

You are going to
beg me to take you back.

But I won't.

I won't.

I'm gonna say goodbye
to my children.

Okay.
And then we'll go.

Okay.


Y'all not gonna
fix me a plate?

(SCOFFS, CLICKS TONGUE)

(ROCK SONG PLAYING)


You keep beating up
these club owners,

there won't be any clubs
left for me to sing at.

No one disrespects us.

I just don't know
what else to do

after nine albums...

Yes, this is Ted White.

I'm calling to speak
to Mr. Whitfield.

Well, I'd like to speak to him
about Aretha Franklin.

Mommy can't cook either.
It's sticky!

(PHONE RINGING)

I'm gonna be honest with ya.

Your version of <i>Skylark</i>
is one of my favorite songs.

Thank you, Mr. Wexler.

Please, call me Jerry.

You know what Etta James said
when she heard it?

She said you pissed all over
that song

and she would never sing it again
in her entire life.

You ruined that song for Etta James.
That is how good it was.

And I'm not
bullshittin' ya, okay?

A lot of these guys out here will
say anything to get in your drawers,

but that's not me.

I'm sorry.
All right, I'm crude.

And you're a church girl,
and I should watch my mouth.

I'm sorry.

You do talk, don't ya?
Not just sing?

You are the sweetest thing,
Aretha.

I'd like you to call me
Miss Franklin.

Okay, Miss Franklin.

What songs would you
like to sing?

I want hits.

TED:
We're done with standards.

We want original songs
made for Aretha only.

Great! We are speaking
the same language, my man.

One of the songwriters I represent
wrote a good song for Aretha,

<i>I Never Loved A Man.</i>

Terrific. I've got
the perfect place to record it.

I'm working with this little
studio down in Alabama and...

Aretha's only recorded
in New York.

Yeah, I know that, but I think
that's part of the problem.

It's overproduced,
it's a little too polished.

I mean, these boys
down there...

"Boys"?

Don't be offended, all right?

I say boys because
they're young like Aretha...

Like Miss Franklin,
not because they're Negroes.

These guys are the best musicians
I have ever worked with in my life,

and that's saying something.
I've been doing this a long time.

They don't need
to read charts.

They just feel their way
through the music.

It's really something.

How does that sound to you?

Sounds good.

And I'm not controlling
like Hammond, okay?

I'm gonna give you plenty of space
to do your thing, all right?

This is your show,
Miss Franklin.

Your record.

Okay?

This is it?

What did all the glamor
at Columbia get me?

Do you know who
you're messing with?

"Do I know who I'm..." Do you know
who you're messing with, buddy?

You tryin' to
screw me over, Rick?

You in my town now, buddy!
This is my place!

It's my record!

Everything you see here is mine!
This is my record!

Miss Franklin, Ted,

welcome.

Jerry.

Nice to see you. Hello.

I'm Rick Hall.

This is my place.

You don't have any Negro
musicians in this town?

Uh, we were just discussing that.
Not today.

Not today?

There was
a miscommunication, Ted.

Negroes only allowed to pick cotton
in these parts, huh?

(SIGHS, CHUCKLES)

Percy Sledge had that same look on his face
when he first come in here.

And then
he heard 'em play

and he was very satisfied
with his record.

I think
you will be, too.

Drink?
We don't have time for this right now...

I like your style.

Where can I
get a jacket like that?

You'd have to
come to Harlem.


Always wanted
to go to Harlem.

Yeah.

Rick, you want drums on this?

I don't know, Roger. You know
any good drummers around here?

Don't, actually.

It's just slow.

It's just a little slow.

MAN: Little slow, yeah.

All right!
Come on, guys!

Hang with me on this.
This is a good song!

It's a great song.

It is what it is.

All right. Let's see
what we can make of it.

RICK:
Hey, Spooner.

You wanna keep that shuffle on there

Let's straighten it out.

Straighten it out.

Let the song do the work.

<i>Yeah, stop showing off, guys.</i>

Yeah, boys, if you're trying to impress me,
it's not working.

Yeah, and more importantly,
it's startin' to piss me off.

Maybe we should do something closer to
the original arrangement.

Nah.
No, it's done.

You kept steppin' on me.

You were all over the neck.
I couldn't tell what you were doing.

They could hear your crash in Texas.

MAN 1: Well, my

You gonna save the song, Jack?

As I have on many an occasion,

It's like the perfect mixture

Baby, that's some of the best singin'

I want to overdub some backgrounds
on the chorus.

You know, I was just thinkin' about that.
We can bring in some local talent...

No, I want to do it.

Okay, okay.

Real good.

It was really comin' together,

I oughta leave you here and

Couldn't you hear that?

We'll finish this

No, I don't wanna make peace

And how'd it feel to take orders

You know,

I don't hate you

A Negro.

I hate you 'cause

(ALL LAUGH)

<i>Aretha Franklin,
you are the Queen of Soul.</i>

<i>What is soul music?</i>

<i>The musician having
the biggest influence on this genre</i>

<i>is Grammy winning soul singer,
Aretha Franklin.</i>

<i>From a young age, I saw Aretha possess
extraordinary talent.</i>

<i>Ted is my husband, manager,
and favorite critic.</i>

<i>Hello, Ted.</i>

<i>Right now, gospel is
the main influence</i>

<i>on contemporary
rhythm and blues,</i>

<i>and that's due to Aretha.
Others have mixed</i>

gospel and so-called
secular music before her,

but Aretha puts a unique spin on it
that people can relate to.

<i>It's always great
when families sing together</i>

<i>because there's a language
between siblings</i>

that you can't recreate
with just hired hands.

<i>Ain't No Way</i> is a song
written by Carolyn for Aretha,

and something Aretha can
relate to because,

<i>I think, they know each other
so well.</i>

Show me how the melody goes
in the verse.

Now,

I am here to honor Aretha.

Every time

I ask Aretha to sing
at a fundraiser,

church event,
or a conference,

she shows up.

(CROWD AGREES)

No matter where she is
or what she's doing,

she always answers the call.

And I am honored
to present Aretha

with this
proclamation today.

I'm so sorry to bother you,

It's all right.

I feel like you are talking

It helps me,
because it is hard out here.

But I feel like you
understand,

and, well,
I just have to thank you.

Stay strong.

Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.

We have to go now.

JERRY: All right, we don't have to name

The entire continent wants you

We should schedule a tour
that coincides with the new album.

We could do that or we could
send her out now

to create an appetite
for the new record.

I think that's best. I have
six venues ready to clear this...

And who are you,

brother?

Ken Cunningham.
I'm the tour manager.

TED: Tour manager?

So, you already
booked the tour?

It's not booked.

TED: No, he said
the venues was ready.

JERRY: That's right.
They were available if we want 'em.

You have to
gauge interest early for it.

I know how a tour works.
JERRY: Okay.

No.
No what?

TED: No European tour dates.

JERRY: Why not?

TED: Because we have some TV dates
we'd like to schedule first.

Oh, yeah? With whom?

Carol Burnett, Andy Williams.
Mike Douglas.

All right. So, those shows will be there
when she gets back.

We have a chance here to expand
her reach around the world.

To make her
a global superstar.

Do you know
what a rare opportunity that is?

We're considering
some movie offers as well.

JERRY: Movies?

Aretha. You wanna do movies?

I think I could.

Of course you could.

You could do
any damn thing you want.

You thought you could
just bring us in here,

tell us where to go, what to do,
and send us on our way?

You should know by now, Jerry,
that is not the way I do business.

Ken, how much money
could Aretha make on the tour?

Quarter of a million.

JERRY: Carol Burnett
payin' that?

Movies payin' that?

We'll consider it.
With the right band.

JERRY: All right. Well, the Muscle Shoals
guys have started their own label.

King Curtis is ready to go.

Curtis is rockin'.
JERRY: He's perfect for you.

Curtis is good, but I've got
some people lined up.

Really? Five minutes ago,
you didn't wanna go on this tour.

Now, you've got
people lined up?

Check the tone, Jerry.

Just take it easy, Ted.

I'm sorry.
Forgive me for my tone.

What musicians
do you have lined up, Ted?

TED: George Davidson.

Miller Brisker.
Russell Conway.

All right. You can't have
the premier singer of our time

touring Europe with a ragtag
bunch of amateurs

suitable for backing some
third-rate blues singer

in a bucket of blood
in Loserville, Louisiana.

I want to use Ted's musicians,
Mr. Wexler.

"Mr. Wexler?"

Oh, God...
Aretha, please.

Can we move on to the next item
on the agenda, please?

Whatever you say,
Miss Franklin.

KEN: So, they do this funny thing in Amsterdam
when they really love a performer.

They pelt them with flowers.

Pardon me.

I warned them
not to get too crazy with it,

but you might
get hit with a few.

After the show, please.
After the show.

<i>Oh, I haven't read it yet,</i>

of such a prestigious magazine.</i>

(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

TRANSLATOR: This <i>Time</i> article says
that your husband beat you in a hotel lobby.

Excuse me?

Is this true?

No more questions!
Let's go!

Move.

It's a lie!
It's a dirty lie!

Get off! Come here!

No, that's too low.
I want ten million dollars.

(PHONE CLATTERS, THUDS)

They're gonna be sorry
they wrote this shit.

And you know, your daddy,
he doesn't come across too well either.

He may wanna
sue 'em his damn self.

How are you gonna prove
that you didn't hit me?

You did and everyone saw it!

Another man would have
killed you by now.

Crazy way you act.

Get out of my way.

What are you gonna do, huh?
What are you gonna do?

I mean it.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

You would still be singing some
Al Jolson shit if it wasn't for me.

I wrote half your hits.
(CHUCKLES)

Are you laughing at me?

You know damn well
you didn't write one word.

One note of anything.

I just let you put your name on it
to keep you from throwing a fit.

<i>I Never Loved A Man</i>
came from me. My songwriter!

That song wasn't anything
until I rearranged it.

And I sang the hell out of it
because it was about you.

You're a lying, no good,

just useless, psychopath.

(GRUNTS)
No!

I'm done with you.

Yeah, you've said that before.

You wait until
your demons come back!

After livin' with you,

I'm ready for 'em.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

You sure that
ain't too much, Ree?

Listen, you're about
to have the meal of your life.

She put her foot in there.
Smell it.

Yes, I did, yes, I did.
She put somethin' in there.

Put her foot in, she did.

I don't know.
That smells funny.

Darlin', get outta there.
(PHONE RINGING)

You want me to get that, Ree?
Yes, answer.

Get outta here!

All right, put it back.

Hello?

ARETHA: And that's me.

This will bring Big Mama
to her knees, honey.

You goin' to Hell for that.

Hey. (CHUCKLES)

She knows.

No, no, no...

No, no, no...

CECIL: What's wrong?

What's wrong?

Hello?

What is it?

What?

(VOICE BREAKING)
What?

It's Martin.

They...

CECIL: Oh, God...

They shot him.

CECIL: Oh, God...

(CROWD APPLAUDS SOFTLY)

He kept telling me

that they were
gonna get him.

But I said, "Martin, the Lord
has more for you to do.

"You're gonna be
all right."

But he knew.

He knew.

Other ministers
were jealous of him,

but I never was.

He was my friend.

I ministered him,

advised him.

Prayed with him.

More time than I can count.

I loved him, Ree.

He loved you.

Who's gonna lead us now?

They don't listen
to me anymore.

You still have
the biggest church in Detroit.

I still know
how to get 'em goin'.

I do.

CLARA: Can I join you?

No. I just wanna talk to Ree.
Can I do that?

Can I just talk to Ree?
Of course you can.

Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
Of course you can.

I'll be right there
when you need me.

They need leadership, Ree.

You should see the way
these fools

are steppin' over Martin's body
to be in charge.

I don't want
no part of that.

And these young revolutionaries
out here,

they don't want
no part of what we built.

They want to free our people.

They all talk.

Not all of them.
I like Angela Davis.

She don't care about
public opinion

and she's not afraid to speak up
to those pigs or anyone else.

Pigs?
Yes, pigs.

You saw what they did to us
during the rebellion.

Riots.

Why shouldn't
we fight back?

And start a full-on war?
You think we can win that?

We're tired of
gettin' our heads kicked in.

Non-violence got us our civil rights
and our right to vote.

At what price?
Our souls?

Our dignity?

Hmm.

I've been thinking.

We should
hit the road again.

Why not?

A northern tour.

Me preachin' and you singin'.
Mm-mm.

Just think on it.

You don't gotta
decide tonight.

I'm not doing that, Daddy.

I know you got your very busy tourin'
and recordin' schedule.

This won't interfere with that.
I won't interfere with that.

No.

I'm done with that.

I can't go back
to headlining with you.

You're not walkin'
in the spirit anymore. (SNIFFS)

That is not true.

You're drinking
and you're whoring around.

Same as you!

You not too old for me
to knock you on your ass!

You know that, right?
Is everything all right?

Just mind your own business!
I'm talkin' to...

Don't talk to her like that.

Have you lost
your mind? Huh?

Maybe.

Maybe I found it.

Come on, let's get you to bed.
Just...

Just don't.

I heard your conversation.

I'm not sorry.

No, you ain't got
nothin' to be sorry for.

Just do
your thing, Ree.

And you do it as big
and as loud

and as long as you can.

Please, just
listen to it again, okay?

I have a great feeling about
this song,

and The Beatles
are getting restless.

They said if you don't do it,
they will.

The song is Catholic, Jerry.

I'm a Baptist.

That's crazy.

They caught Angela Davis.

What?
That can't be right.

No, no, no.

NEWSREADER: <i>Angela Davis,
a young Black militant</i>

<i>who has been hunted
for nearly two months</i>

<i>on murder
and kidnapping charges,</i>

<i>was arrested yesterday
at a hotel in midtown Manhattan</i>

<i>by agents of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.</i>

Angela Davis must go free.

Black people will be free.

My daddy says I don't know
what I'm doing.

I respect him, of course,
but I have to stick by my beliefs.

You have to disturb the peace
when you can't get no peace.

What the hell is this tour schedule?
Half the damn dates are gone!

All right, all right, we were just about
to have a talk with you about this.

We?

We're not having
a family barbecue?

This is one of these
Ken hippie talks?

I told you
this wasn't gonna work.

Just breathe.

Put the damn dates back.

Don't do it, Cecil.
Listen, Ree...

You work for me, Cecil.

CECIL: You overbook.

You don't show up for half the dates,
then I have to deal with the fallout.

It's your damn job!

ERMA: We're trying
to help you.

Aretha, you need
to slow down.

You stop for five minutes,
they forget all about you.

That's ridiculous.

How would you know, Erma?
You barely have one hit.

KEN: Ree, you haven't
slept in months.

CAROLYN: And you look like it.

You don't want me to tell you
what you look like, Carolyn.

Well, next time
you have a breakdown,

don't call us, all right?

I won't.

Come on, let's go outside.
Come on.

ARETHA: And don't call me
when you need a gig

or you want me to write liner notes
in your jive-ass album

or introduce you
to some producers,

or just borrow some cash
that your ass never pay back.

If I don't work,
y'all don't eat.

Right.

Put the damn dates
back, Cecil.

Three venues in three states
in three days.

Happy now?
Yes, I am.

And don't ever pull that
bullshit with me again.

I know how to run
my damn business.

You asked me.

Y'all just wanna
take my crown.

Oh, God.
Please.

Ree, think about our son.
This isn't good for him.

Don't tell me
I'm a bad mother.

Here comes the paranoia.
KEN: I never said that!

Olga, bring Miss Franklin
a fruit juice.

Don't you dare.

What you staring at?
Go get my lunch.

Yes, ma'am.

Tell me y'all don't want
what I got.

CECIL: All right, forget it!

I can't talk to you
when that demon takes hold.

You don't know
what I go through.

Y'all don't know
what I've been through!

We love you, Ree.

Why can't you
see that, Ree?

Get the hell out of my house.

No, don't move.
We're going to deal with this, Ree.

Out!

Out!

Out!

Come on, baby, please...

Ree, listen to me.
They're here to help you.

It's your family.

<i>Your soul's intact</i>

I'm gonna take the kids
back to Detroit with me.

I think that's best.

KEN: What are you
thinking right now?

Just things.

What things?

Private things.

After all this time,
you're still keepin' stuff from me?

You don't keep stuff from me?

No.

You should.

Why? I trust you.

Don't you trust me?

Sometimes.

What do I have to do
to make it all the time?

Just let me be.

I know what to do.

Mm.

KEN: Be here with me. Just let
your mind go quiet for a moment.

That would be easy if you
stopped talking.


What's wrong?

Nothing.

I have to make some calls.

You don't
have to call anyone, Ree.

You don't know
what I have to do.

Don't go to that dark place.

Come here.

Come here.

Tell me what's wrong, baby.

You're shaking.

You act so tough.

I can see that
little scared girl in you.

Shit!

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

It's all right.

Shit!

She can't do it, Cecil.

CECIL:
<i>Put her on the phone.</i>

She's asleep right now.
Her migraine.

<i>Man, who do you
think you're bullshittin'?</i>

<i>Tell Ree, she's gonna

MAN: And...

<i>In the morning...</i>

An all-gospel record
has a very limited audience.

I don't care.

You do care.

You sat in that office
with me six years ago,

and you said
you wanted to make hits,

and I think you still do.

I'm making this album, Jerry.

All right, can you
just hear me out, please?

I'm making this album, or I'll never
make an album with you again.

All I wanna do
is drink now, Jerry.

Well, let me get you
into a program.

I'm in a program,
but I need the church.

I need the spirit.

It has always gotten me through,
and it will get me through again.

Okay. Well, can we just...
I mean, just think about this...

This album is not for me
or for you or anybody else.

This album is for God.

And you can't jive God, Jerry,
so stop trying.

(LAUGHS)
JERRY: Oh.

I'm not trying to jive you
or Jesus, okay?

It's the gospel record.

It's 1972, for Christ's sake.
Sorry. I...

Hey,

how about we make a documentary
film to go along with the record?

Why?

So, the international fans,
the hippies,

the atheists like me
can see you in your element

and understand
the music that made you.

You mean
for white people?

Well, I...

All right. Yes.

That's a great idea.

So, you're not gonna leave me?

We're not done yet.

Oh, boy. What?

I want to
produce the album, too.



All right. Okay. Okay.

we're gonna take a ten.

Let's take ten.
Let's...


Are you all right?

I can't make
a fool out of myself.

There's gonna be
a film crew here.


And if I break down like I did right now,
they gonna think I lost my mind.

Ree...

Ree, the spirit
is the spirit.

It moves when it moves.

What you want us to do?
Behave like Episcopalians?

Now what's
really bothering you?

You told me once

that music
would save my life.

I did.

What if it doesn't?

The demon is strong.

Ain't no demon
hauntin' you, Ree.

There never was.

Just the pain you've been
runnin' from your whole life.

But you gotta let it go, Ree.

Give it to God.

It wasn't your fault.


And He knows that.

I don't know about tomorrow

or the concert or the album
or the documentary.

You in church right now.

You're safe.

So, Ree,

let's have church.

(CHURCH ORGAN PLAYING)

Daddy.

It's good to see you.

We were in California, and we heard
that you were singing gospel, and...

Clara dragged me here.

Clara can't make you
do anything.

She's got pretty feisty
since you last saw her.

Glad you came.

That surprises me, 'cause we haven't
been getting on as of late.

You told me
I wasn't walking in the spirit.

I was angry.

You were with God.

You have always
been with God.

He was with me.

I tried to run from Him,
but He brought me back.

Like Jonah.

Like Jonah.

You taught me every song
I'm singing today.

I did my best.

But you have exceeded
all of my expectations, Ree.

I'm about to bust wide open,
and you're just getting started.

I can't imagine
what you're gonna do next.

Because you can
do anything, Ree.

First, give an honor to God,

who's the head
of all our lives.

(CONGREGATION APPLAUDING)
Yes. Amen.

JAMES: I'm sure you all have noticed
the cameras by now.

Don't get distracted by it.

We here to have church, right?

CONGREGATION: Amen!

JAMES: All right.

This is the first
