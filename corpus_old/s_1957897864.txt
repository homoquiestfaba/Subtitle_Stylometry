MAN: (SINGING)
<i>It was Christmas Eve, babe</i>

<i>In the drunk tank</i>

<i>An old man said to me</i>

<i>Won't see another one</i>

<i>And then we sang a song</i>

<i>The Rare Old Mountain's Dew</i>

<i>I turned my face away</i>

<i>And dreamed about you...</i>


Hey, this one looks good.

What in the fires of Ogord
y'all think you doing?

Hey, Captain. We're just, uh...
Have you ever heard of Christmas?

What?

Well, it's a celebration we have
once a year on Earth,

where everybody gets presents
for each other.

So, me and Kraglin made this tree
and we got gifts for everyone.

It was Pete's idea.

Eh...

And this one here's for you.
Don't come at me with no damn gifts.

What a Ravager gets, he works for.
We ain't about no damn handouts.

It's more like a sign of appreciation.
That sounds more like sentiment, boy.

That may be okay for you
mushy types on Terra,

but out here in the cold rigors of space,
it's what'll get you killed.

And you, you ought to know better.

Now, get this crap out of here.

If it ain't out of here before I get back,

you're both gonna be cleaning the latrines
for the rest of the damn year.

But that's Gef's favorite job.
You talking back now, Kraglin?

No.

(YELLING ANGRILY)

I hate Christmas!

And that's how
Yondu ruined Christmas forever.

That is so sad.


I like the part where Yondu
kicked over the tree.

(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

Anyways, I just saw on the Multi-calendar

that right now on Earth,
it's almost Christmastime.

So, yeah, it kind of brings back
some memories.

Yondu had a point.

Ever since buying Knowhere
from The Collector,

we don't have time for trivialities
like Christmas.

This place needs a lot of fixing up
before it's livable.

Yeah, I reckon we've got work to do.
Yeah.

That was such a heartbreaking story.

I know. I hate stories
where everybody lives.

Thank you.
Yeah.

Cosmo, what use is telekinesis
if you can't even aim?

COSMO: You wanna do it? Do it.

Just concentrate, you stupid mutt.


What?

COSMO: I refuse to do any more work
while you demean me.

All right, all right.
I'm sorry. Chill out.

COSMO: Also, I want one of those
delicious treats in that bag.

(ROCKET GROANS)


(COSMO GIGGLES)

ROCKET: All right, that's it.
Back to work.

BZERMIKITOKOLOK: Here he comes.

Hey, Peter.

Oh. Hi, Bzermikitokolok.

My bandmates and I have been mastering

these old Earth instruments
and working on a little ditty.

And I thought you might
be able to help us out

as it's about
one of your Earth traditions.

Oh?
Christmas.

Oh.

Everything I know about Christmas,
I learned from Rocket,

who learned from Cosmo,
who learned from Kraglin,

who learned from you.

So I thought I might just take it back
to the source

and make sure
I understand this all correctly.

This is, after all, a historical document.

Okay. Yeah, sure.
Okay.

<i>closest to the sun</i>

<i>There's a special celebration
And it sounds quite fun</i>

<i>A jolly old fellow brings toys to everyone</i>

<i>On a holiday they call Christmas</i>

That's perfect. Good. Bzer, good job.

<i>Now I'm not gonna lie</i>

Oh, there's more.

<i>It makes no sense to me</i>

<i>But here's what I've discovered
about this Christmas mystery</i>

I'm super busy. Is this a long song?

One, two, three.

<i>Santa is a furry freak
with epic superpowers</i>

<i>He flies to every human home
in under 14 hours</i>

<i>He's a master burglar</i>

No.

<i>A pro at picking locks</i>

No.

<i>If you don't leave milk and cookies out</i>

<i>He will put dung in your socks</i>

That is not part of the lore at all.

<i>If you act nicely through the night</i>

<i>And don't jump on your bed</i>

<i>Santa comes with sugar plums
and hurls them at your head</i>

<i>But if you're on his naughty list</i>

<i>He shoots missiles at your toes</i>

<i>He might just roast your chestnuts</i>

<i>With his powerful flamethrower</i>

No, he doesn't have a flamethrower.

<i>Rein, rein, rein, rein, rein</i>

That's kinda cool.

<i>Deer, deer, deer, deer, deer</i>

<i>I don't know what Christmas is
But Christmastime is here</i>

<i>He's compelled his creepy elves
to do his every wish</i>

Huh?

<i>One sought to be a dentist
Now he's sleeping with the fish</i>

<i>Mrs. Claus, she works the pole
Plans her man's demise</i>

No!

<i>Soon the elves will all rise up</i>

<i>And stab out Santa's eyes</i>

I am Groot.

<i>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho</i>

<i>Earthlings are so weird</i>

That's true.

<i>I don't know what Christmas is
But Christmastime is here</i>

<i>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho</i>

<i>Earthlings are so weird</i>

<i>I don't know what Christmas is
But Christmastime is here</i>

<i>What the heck's a turtledove?</i>

<i>And who lit up that deer?</i>

<i>I don't know what Christmas is
But Christmastime is here</i>

<i>I don't know what Christmas is
But Christmastime is here</i>

<i>Or maybe it's there
Or it's somewhere</i>

I don't know.

You just got these instruments?
Thank you, Knowhere.

(CROWD APPLAUDING TEPIDLY)

Have you ever seen a crowd more into it?

He loved it, guys. (SIGHS IN RELIEF)

It sounds like Christmas
is a wonderful time,

and Yondu ruined it for Peter.

I feel like I should do something.

Why?
Because of, you know, my secret.

The one only you know.

That you ate the entire bowl of zarg-nuts
in the commissary?

My other secret.
That you're Quill's sister?

Why don't you just tell people the truth?

Peter's father, our father,
killed his mother and tried to kill him.

I don't want him to be reminded of that
every time he sees me.

No, I meant about the zarg-nuts.

Oh. I don't think anyone cares
about that but you.

Maybe because I'm his sister,

I feel like I should give Peter
a happy Christmas.

He's so sad about Gamora being gone.

Maybe if we gave Peter
a really wonderful Christmas gift,

it would make him happy.

Well, we could give him those zarg-nuts,
except you ate them all.

Get over the zarg-nuts!

What kind of present?
Something special he will never forget.

What about someone special?
What?

Over the years, Quill has talked about
one person more than any other.

A legendary hero
who has saved countless lives.

We could give him to Quill as a present.

Kyra, hey, honey.

KYRA: <i>Hey, baby.</i>
(CHUCKLES)

I can't wait for you guys
to get back from New York.

<i>- Did you get the stuff?</i>
Yep.

Yeah, I got all the presents.

Everything is set
for the perfect family Christmas.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

MAN: (SINGING)
<i>I don't care what the neighbors say</i>

<i>Christmastime is near</i>

<i>I don't care what anyone says</i>

<i>Christmas is full of cheer</i>

<i>All I know is that Santa's...</i>

Wow!

I wonder which one belongs to Kevin Bacon.


Drax, why are they staring?

You put the cloaking device on
like you said you did, right?

Yes.

I can plainly see that you just did it
right now in front of me.

No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.

No, I didn't.

I wish I brought Groot.

So, we'll go down into the city
and ask people where Kevin Bacon is.

DRAX: Do you think
Kevin Bacon is the leader of the world

or just to most people?

I think everybody.
Oh! I'm so excited.

(BOTH LAUGH GLEEFULLY)

MAN: (SINGING) <i>I can hear the sleigh bells</i>
<i>coming around the bend</i>

<i>Here comes the darkest end</i>

<i>Christmas is here</i>


(GIGGLING EXCITEDLY)

(WOMAN EXCLAIMS)

Steve!

Why is he running away?
I don't know.

Hey!
No! I'm sorry. GoBots killed his cousin.

I'll rip your head off!
Drax! Stop being a bigot.

(BELL DINGING)

Oh. Hey, can we get a picture?
Come on, guys. Come on. Ready?

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

Okay, amazing. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

We got a picture with the God of War.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

(CROWD CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

(WOMEN LAUGHING)

<i>My dear</i>

<i>Is this Christmas?</i>

<i>Whatever happened to that festive cheer?</i>


(DRAX GRUNTING)

MANTIS: Could Kevin Bacon be in here?

WOMAN: (SINGING)
<i>Don't think I have the energy</i>

<i>To add to my already mad rush</i>

(MUSIC CONTINUES)
(CROWD CLAMORING)

<i>The perfect gift for me would be</i>

<i>Completions and connections left from</i>

<i>Last year, ski shop</i>

<i>Encounter, most interesting</i>

<i>Had his number but never the time</i>

<i>Most of '81 passed along those lines</i>

<i>So deck those halls
Trim those trees</i>

<i>Raise up cups of Christmas cheer</i>

<i>I just need to catch my breath</i>

Give us your finest libations.

Have you seen Kevin Bacon anywhere?

Why would I know where
Kevin Bacon is located?

<i>Calendar picture, frozen landscape</i>

<i>Chilled this room for 24 days</i>

<i>Evergreens, sparkling snow</i>


Mmm. More.

(MANTIS GIGGLES)

(MANTIS WHOOPS)

Come out and dance with us.
Dancing is for people who are pathetic.


Well, how about a drink then?
Yes!

Two shots of tequila, please.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(MANTIS LAUGHS WILDLY)

(LAUGHING HEARTILY)


(WHOOPING)
(LAUGHING)

I can't believe not a single one

of our new homies (HICCUPS)
know where Kevin Bacon is.

There are tens of thousands of people
on this planet

and we don't even know
what Kevin Bacon looks like.

MAN: (SINGING)
<i>Said it was like Christmas</i>

You wanna know where Kevin Bacon lives?

Yes.

That's 40 bucks.

Uh-oh.

I don't know where my money is.

Give it to me for free.

<i>By the time we got to Oslo</i>

Give me all your money.

<i>The snow was gone</i>

MANTIS: Drax, move faster.

MAN 1 ON TV: <i>It won't be exactly the same
as the one you have on Earth,</i>

<i>but I'm sure it will serve your purpose.</i>

MAN 2: <i>Good. Good.
Now I'd like to get going</i>

<i>and have the toy shop operating full-blast</i>

<i>so that I can return
to Earth for Christmas.</i>

<i>'Cause, you know, Mrs. Claus
is a very good-natured woman. But...</i>

<i>Santa Claus,
you will never return to Earth.</i>

<i>Wait.</i>


(DOORBELL RINGS)

KEVIN: <i>Yeah. Can I help you?</i>


Yes. We are looking for
the legendary Kevin Bacon.

We're looking for
the legendary Kevin Bacon.

<i>I just said that, Drax.</i>

<i>Your voice is small and mousy.
I think maybe he didn't hear you.</i>

<i>He heard. He's Kevin Bacon.
He's probably got great ears.</i>

I'm sorry, guys. I can't help you.

But wait, wait, wait, wait.

(RINGS DOORBELL)
Hello?

(RINGS DOORBELL)
Hello?

(RINGS DOORBELL CONTINUOUSLY)
Hello? Hello? Hello!

He's gone. Look what you did.

You acted weird
and you made him not want to talk to us.

Sorry.

Do you think you can toss me
over the gate if you...

(MANTIS EXCLAIMS)

Ow! (GRUNTS)

What are you doing?
Tossing you over the gate.

I didn't mean right that second.
I meant after I was ready.

I wasn't even done talking.

Toss you over the gate.
Don't toss you over the gate.

Make up your mind.

Whoa!


I want this funny man.
Don't just take stuff.


Oh.

But I guess that's what it's here for.

(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

MANTIS: Kevin Bacon!

Kevin Bacon!

Kevin Bacon!

(DOORBELL RINGS)

(BANGING ON DOOR)

Kevin Bacon!

Kevin Bacon!

(DOORBELL RINGING)

<i>- Kevin Bacon!</i>
(BANGING ON DOOR)

Okay, guys, I don't know what
you're thinking, but this is not cool.

This is private property.

Now, kindly put down my elf
and my candy cane and go.

I'm calling the police right now.


OPERATOR OVER PHONE:
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

You're coming with us.
As a Christmas present.

<i>911. Can I help you? Hello? Hello?</i>

There's two... I don't know what they are.
People in costumes.


MAN: (SINGING)
<i>I want an alien for Christmas</i>

<i>Bring me an alien this year</i>

<i>I want a little green guy
About three feet high...</i>


<i>I want an alien for Christmas
this year</i>

DRAX: Wait.
What?

I left my little funny man
back in the house.

What?
I wanna go back and get him.

But Kevin Bacon is gonna get away.

But you still have your swirly
red and white curly man.

How can you possibly think this is a man?

What is it?
I don't know. A shape?

Well, how is it fair you get to keep it
and I don't?

Because I was responsible
and held on to it.

Drax, do you love Peter
and want to save Christmas?

Or do you want a little funny man?

Uh...

A little funny man.
No!


(MANTIS SNARLING)

(SIREN WAILING)

Mr. Bacon. We got your 911 call.
You gotta get these things away from me.

Hey, I'm a police officer.

I don't know what's going on here,
but you need to back up or I'll shoot.

Raise your hands above your head! Stop!

(GUN FIRES)
(DRAX CHUCKLES)


Stop. It tickles.
Stop. I'm gonna pee my pants.

(DRAX LAUGHING)

Sleep.
Hey!

Sleep.
Let him go! Let him go! Let him go!

Freeze! Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

Sleep.

(SIREN WAILING)

(DRAX LAUGHS HEARTILY)

Drax! You can't just kill people.

Well, how am I supposed to know the rules
if no one tells me?

Are you okay?

We are not doing anything wrong.

We are just taking the legendary hero
Kevin Bacon,

to give him as a present to a friend
who is sad about Christmas.

Okay.

Here.

I really wanted this,
but we're even now, okay?

Sure.

That doesn't look like a man to you,
does it?

A man? No.

Of course not.
My friend is being an idiot.



You would love to come with us.

Hey, where are we going?
First, there.

Whoa!

Coolness.

Oh, no, no</i>

<i>I got to make this holiday glow</i>

CHORUS:
<i>Like a lightbulb</i>

Are you friends with the Fonz?

Who?
The Fonz.

Fonz. He's a hero, like you.
Have the two of you ever had a team-up?

Oh. Well, the Fonz's real name
is Henry Winkler.

And, yeah, I do know him.
He's a very nice guy.

Would you consider grabbing dinner,
like, one time a team-up?

No. Eating together is not a team-up.

Tell us, what was it like
when you had to save a small town

by dancing like an idiot?

Oh. Well, that wasn't me.

That was a character that I played,
Ren McCormack, in the movie, <i>Footloose.</i>

What?

What about when you fought and defeated

the super-strong masked killer
Jason Voorhees in the woods?

Yeah.

Nope. Again, not me.
Just a character I played.

And he didn't actually kill Jason.

He got stabbed through the neck
with an arrow.


Yeah.

He's an actor!
He's never actually saved anyone.

But actors are repugnant.
I know.

(RETCHING AND COUGHING)

They make me feel gross and creepy
when they pretend to be someone else.

Acting is a wonderful profession.

I mean, you don't get to live
just one life,

you get to live so many lives...

A disgusting actor!

This is the worst day of my life!
We ruined Christmas worse than Yondu.

Peter was a child when he left Earth.
His memory is all screwed up.

He doesn't remember things right.

Kevin Bacon, you have to pretend
you're an actual hero,

or else Christmas is doomed.

(IN BRITISH ACCENT) Blimey, mate.

I can't wait to storm them Nazis
on the beach.

What are you doing?
I'm a hero, ain't I then?

I'm a private in the British Army
during World War II.

No. Just your regular voice.

(IN NORMAL ACCENT) Oh. Okay.
Yeah, sure, fine. Hello. I'm the Batman.

I mean, hello. I'm Bruce Wayne.
Who is Bruce Wayne?

No! Don't be someone else. Be Kevin Bacon,
but, like, if you didn't suck!


That's something.

How weird. 'Cause, like, normally,
it would really piss me off,

but I don't know.

Right now, for some reason,
I just feel really great about all of it.

Hmm.

We hate you.

MAN: (SINGING)
<i>We watch the children playing</i>

<i>Beside the Christmas tree</i>

<i>Presents are wrapped up
It's beautiful</i>

<i>And secretly the gifts you hide</i>

<i>The fun awaits for you inside</i>

<i>'Cause Christmastime has come for you</i>

<i>I remember dreaming</i>

<i>-Wishing, hoping, praying for this day</i>

<i>The little ones I love</i>

<i>So excited by the way</i>

<i>It's time to peer inside</i>

<i>So anxious for your look of joy</i>

Merry Christmas, Peter.
From me and Drax and, you know,

all of us, really.

<i>Christmastime has come</i>

<i>There'll be toys for everyone</i>

<i>'Cause Christmastime has come</i>

<i>For you</i>

Oh! You guys.

<i>There'll be toys for everyone</i>

What did you do?

<i>'Cause Christmastime has come</i>

<i>For you</i>

(BOX THUMPING)

KEVIN: Hey, uh, guys,
I'm about to pass out.

There's no air in here.

(MANTIS GIGGLES)

Ta-da!

You must be Pete. Merry Christmas!

It's Kevin Bacon. He's not a loser.
He's great. We don't hate him at all.

What'd you do?

What?
What did you do?

We got you Kevin Bacon as a present.
You got me a human being as a present?

What better gift for the guy
who has everything

than an actual human living person?

This isn't a Christmas gift!
This is human trafficking!

Yes!
It was mostly Drax's idea.

It was.

Hey, Pete, I got to stick up
for these guys,

because to tell you the truth,

I am totally stoked
about the whole thing, man.

You used your powers on him, didn't you?
Maybe. I can't remember.

Get Kevin Bacon out of the trance now!

Just be what you really are.

(SCREAMS)
(GASPS)


Dude, calm down. We're not gonna hurt you.

That's a talking raccoon.
I'll kill you. Don't ever call me that!

Whoa!

Sir, sir, sir. Right here, right here.

Kraglin, prepare <i>The Bowie</i>
for his transport back to Earth.

Aye, Captain.
Mr. Bacon, I am so sorry.

This is really embarrassing.

I know you're worried sick
and your family is, too.

We're gonna get you back home immediately.

I am Groot.

Oh. Suddenly you thought
it was a bad idea all along?

I am Groot.

Dude, I literally just saw you
wheel him out in front of everybody.

I'm gonna let you go, Kevin Bacon.
Don't run.

You're not gonna run?
No, no. No, no, no.

(SHOUTS IN FEAR)

Go get Kevin Bacon.
I've got it.

Don't kill him.
NEBULA: You can't outrun me, Bacon!

Hey, that man was a plant.

Oh, Groot? He's just a kid.
Sorry about all this stuff.

What's that on your head?

That is a device for
controlling a flying arrow.

But I ain't quite got the hang of it yet.

I know this must all be a shock to you,

but it's only 'cause you mean a great deal
to Pete that they've done it.

Pete didn't have much to love growing up,

but one thing he did love
was telling us all stories about you.

Me?
You saved a town through dancing.

And once, Pete saved the whole galaxy
with dancing. For real.

You taught him how to be a hero,

and now he might just be
the greatest hero alive.

Mant and these dopes,

they was just hoping you'd bring the joy
of Christmas back into his heart, is all.

I can't believe you guys did
all of that for me. I mean, why?

Why what?

Why would you go to the trouble of going
all the way to Earth

to abduct Kevin Bacon?

Kraglin told us the story
about how Yondu ruined Christmas.

So we wanted to save it for you.


I'm not sure Kraglin knows how
that story ended.

That is so sweet.

That's Yondu.

I guess I just wanted to do something

What?
Your father, Peter.

He might be...
Ego? He might be what?

He might be...

He is my father, too.

Wait. So does that make you my sister?
