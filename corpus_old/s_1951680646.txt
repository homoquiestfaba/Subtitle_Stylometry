The force is of Strickland.

He is always and you don't forget it.

I dare and I always support you.

You are the best, brother.

You tell to Osito

Perhaps he/she got lost.

Not it would be strange in university student.

Amber is not anyone!

Not we can make more.

Yes, because there is something
that I can make.

He/she listens, I will call you if I know something.

We will find the baby.

Me. She didn't have anything to see.

Don't put it, yes, I was me.

Lower it.

Are you a cachorrita golfa and brave not?

They are my cream and cream.

Carajo.

You would prefer to violate a bell

This shit will put an end to the family.
It won't improve it.

Everything because pa convinced you.

So you go and untie it.

They have the baby.

It only cares the family.

Life or death. This continues.

We go for her.

Silence.

Now, these are the rules:
there are not rules.

They will fight to death.

Have a good time.

Now, this is the situation:

One will kill to the other one
or I will kill them at two o'clock.

Now stop to lose my time.

Who does want to survive?

We have a winner.

We have more fights.

Take to the survivor
to my room.

It is hour of the reproduction.

 What does it happen?
Porfavor helps me.

Oh, I will help you.

Cover you the hearings. Not listen.

Yes, that will work.

Make as if you were of purchases.

He/she should have left gagged you.

Oh yes. Then gag me.

Does he/she hear you are a Hackford?

Bear!

He/she takes care of your answers, boy.

Where is my baby?

 How do you go?

Amber, I don't want to die.

Not you will die, I won't allow it.

What you see, golfa campirana.

A dead one
or maybe a sexual toy.

Play well.

Good-bye.

Put to the crazy dog in their hole.

Jenny! They come here.

My name is Amber. She is Jenny.

How do you call yourself?

Dawn...

It is clear that it hurts you
but... what did it happen?

God. They made me kill a girl.

It violated me...it violated me!

Degenerate bastards!

Calm down. He/she calms down.

They are playing with us.

They will make you kill her.

Then it grabs and you...

It is well, it is well.

Is it?

You want that

You think that you are the first he-goat
that it forces me?

Carajo, takes your number.

He/she takes care of what you say.

Her.

No...

Take to me... to me.

In this damned house, I choose.

But since you want to die
right now, we go.

I have just made I eat up you taught, pa.

You will have some beautiful children.

Not it is so bad.
If you are lucky and you win.

No!

Now, dogs...

Porfavor doesn't put under an obligation.

He/she leaves of pendejear
and it kills that dog.

Finish it.

I will kill you!

Do you like games?

I will catch and until
rotate your eyes in the nape.

And believe me piruja,
this donkey hooter will charge it.

No, dog;

And it takes out at last o'clock.
We have a fight more.

No, no, Amber. No, Amber!

Have a good time, boys.

Don't force me to leave.

Here yes there are winners.

Peléen!

You make me be very bad.

 Do you want to fight?
Not you do want to fight?

Candy why you don't take me
to this thing to the room. Good-bye.

Royce, Squirm! I have them a gift.

They have like one hour
before he/she cools down.

Here not, take it to the other room.

Now, all world to the carajo.

Well donkey,

Ah, how bad. I believed that you had died.

Yes, I also missed you.

They are catching it to him out.

Weak prostitute.
Not you go anywhere.

-I have to go for Jenny.
-But if it is a dead dog.

Move!

My brother will kill me
if I allow leave again.

What?

Yes, he likes variety

Candy is so soft and warm.

And I am hard and fry.

But he/she loves us at two o'clock.

Very well, the blood is thicker
that the water...

I was about being kind,
but they are not human.

Carajo.

I Go for Jenny. Don't move,
I return for you.

Why do you make this?

He/she closes the hole.

-What?
-Get undressed.

Please, porfavor,
don't make this.

Silence!

Now...do you want to continue speaking?

Well.

They will hear you.

Behind of you!

I see that my brother likes you.

I want my time of game.

Yes that your sister thought.

I already gorged of playing.

We only go for Dawn
and we will release ourselves.

Where is it?

In the other room.

Oh, Bear. Oh, Bear.

Where is Dawn?

Where the girl is

Where is Brody?

Very well. We will look for them.

Die!

It is hour of leaving.
Well, we go.

Oh, Amber.
Oh God. You are well.

 Against how many Hackford
do we face?

Not I know, they are a clan.

Is there smaller?

No; they are dead.

Very well.

Here the van is.

We should move 5 kms. to the northeast
for the forests to arrive.

Well. I dare and I will lag behind
to distract them.

I won't leave them in the absolute thing.

He/she listens, Amber, you have to make it.
It is necessary to liberate these girls.

Don't worry.

We have our things, we will rediscover ourselves
in the van. I promise it to you.

Well.

Well, we go, we go.

Candy!

The goose is already greased.
I am clever to catch.

Slower, I don't understand you.

 What? Royce.

They are dead, you hear me,
dead, carajo.

Go for the cousins!

Listen: they escaped again
those old cabronas.

I want them to bring them of turn
and live.

It is my future.

Go for them.

Not we will escape, brother.
It is hour of fighting.

Allow them to go.
We will reach them in one second.

Ahead.

Wait! Not I can continue.

They already come.
Not we can stop.

Very well, Dawn, is well.
Will we achieve it Yes?

Not you desconcentres.

It recovers the encouragement,
then we have that we move.

Well?

Well.

We lack it less than kilometer and half
for the car.

Will it achieve it?

It will achieve it, have this way to load it.

 What was that?

In march!

Now listen to me, boy.
Anything good it will leave this.

The best thing that can make
it is to protect your sister and to leave of here.

Don't worry about me.
I will be well.

You have always been strong.

Now I need you stronger than never
to protect your sister at all cost.

Well. I love you, boy.

Now ahead and salt of here.

Hour of correcting errors.

High!

This is my earth, he-goats.

Tell to pa that I will fix this.

We go, we go.

Very well, I will help my siblings.

So I will have to leave them one minute.

No, you cannot leave us.
Not I can alone.

Jenny, I need you to be strong.

I didn't abandon them to you.
And I won't abandon them to them.

He/she takes. He/she will give you value.
You will be strong as this bear.

Well.
We will be here when you return.

What?

We will be well.

Not I can tolerate!
It is too much.

Some minutes have only passed.
It is dark and they are too many forests.

Not he/she will return.
It looks for the keys and vámonos of here.

He/she always returns.

 What do you make?

I release myself of here.

We won't leave.

They are them! They are them!

Hurry!

Curse.

Not I can see anything!
Where are they?

Calm down. I look for the keys.

Not I want to die.

Prostitute's son.

Prostitute

Curse.
Catch it, imbecile!

No...

He/she dies, he/she dies.

He/she hears, calm. I am me.

I killed him, I killed him.

I know it. I already know.

But you made well.

But we have to leave. Do you understand?

We go, we go.

Bear!

Oh Bear, what pleasure he/she gives me to see you.

Where is Brody?

No...Brody not.

Good, I suppose that I still have you.

Hour of dying.

Oh, curse, does that hurt not?

No, Osito, I need you,
please you don't leave me.

I need you, Osito,
please you don't leave me.

Why carajos don't you die?

Because I am a Strickland
incestuous bastard.

Those are my uncles,
rustic prostitute.

 And is all that you have?

That yes it is a pretty one
face of the carajo the one that you have.

Now yes, dog.

He/she will have a good time me to catch.
You are so tight.

Go, square.

Hour of the reproduction, dog.

Not I can wait
to crack, golfa.

The heat finished.

 What did it happen?

He/she finished. All are dead.

It is only a thing to make.

What?

To gather to my family.

Thanks to God.
I believed that both had died.

Baby, is needed more than
an incestuous one to be taken to a Strickland.

Calm. Your brother and me
we will need time to heal.

Yes.

It seems that they had practiced it.

They were very well.

-Not you are the only cabrona in the family.
-No.

We go home.

Yes Mister.

I no longer need this.

You made me strong.
And I will always have here that.

Good, as always I say:
the force is with Strickland.

I help you.
