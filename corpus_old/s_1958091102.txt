My name is Jimi,
and I'm 21 years old.

And there you have it,
the answers to my two

most frequently
asked questions.

Number one--

Jenny?

Jimi, as in Hendrix.

And number two--

How old are you?

Here's what I want to say--

I'm nine.

Child labor laws.

Instead, I just laugh
it off and say,

Oh I'm actually 21.

I'm 21.

Maybe I look younger
because I'm 5 foot 1,

or because I ride a bike,
and don't drive a car.

Or could be that I don't wear
much makeup, I don't know.

Truth is I'm an old soul,
and I think that counts.

I love quality and authenticity.

I work at a thrift store
aptly named Second Chances.

See, I even use grownup
words like aptly.

Every day I'm surrounded by all
of these beautiful authentic

items, and they
all have a story.

And this may sound
silly, but I actually

belive each item has
a little bit of hope,

that they'll get
another chapter.

And that we have in common.

You're never going to
believe what I found.

Who sold us this bag?

That bag?

The one that's perfect for me.

Is that a ransom note?

Right up your alley Junie Mae.

The woman who wrote it never
gave it to her boyfriend,

so they broke up.

And he doesn't know that she
didn't actually cheat on him,

it was just some guy friend
that he saw her with.

So we need to find him
and give this to him

so they can get back together.

Why didn't she give it
to him, or tell him?

Why can't people
just communicate?

Well, I can save you the time.

Her name is Liz Brewer.

And her ex, who also sold
us some of that stuff right

over there, is Steve Wade.

Hey guys, can I help
you find anything?

No, we're just looking around.

She hated to keep that
bag, he gave it to her.

Well, she should have it back,
and they should be together.

I mean, simple
solution, communicate.

Oh, Aiden.

Yeah, I checked on
that Game Boy for you.

You know it, nothing's
come in yet.

Okay.

Hi, Aiden.

Yeah.

Oh Jimi, this is Aiden

Yeah, he's on the lookout
for an old school Game Boy.

Oh fun.

It's nice to meet you Jenny.

Oh, it's Jimi, like Hendrix.

My grandparents, Woodstock.

Woodstock, wow.

Um, you know, we'll
definitely be in touch.

We, we could text you too.

You just put your
cell number down there

with all your other info.

Write down your
street address on there

and we'll ship it
straight to you.

Or just drop in when
you're in the neighborhood.

Thank you Miss Davis.

Uh, that's Junie May to you.

Got it.

So nice to meet you Jimi.

Same.

Not a good communicator.

Hi, just one?

Um, oh, hey.

Hey, what's up?

Hi.

I'll just --thank you.

No, I'm not stalking you.

Okay, just let me know when
you're ready to order.

Thank you.

I was um, riding home
and I was so hungry.

Yeah, the uh, food
here is good.

So um, how's life on campus?

Um, it's pretty good.

I'm meeting a lot
of new people.

Anyone interesting?

Yeah, I mean, I got
a new roommate,

my campus housing site.

Oh cool, yeah.

I met you.

Okay, ready to order?

Uh, yes. Um, I, I will have
the chicken salad with ranch

on the side please.

Thank you.

Well, it doesn't have to be.

It's back, the pioneer days at
Second Chances thrift store.

Oh-hoh, pioneer days
at Second Chances.

Howdy.

What you doing Boomer?

It's called marketing.

And this is Sara, our
new marketing intern.

Howdy.

Hello Sara.

Well, I'll meet you
guys inside.

I'll go get ready
for the stampede.

Howdy, all our tacky
stuff, 80% off.

No, 20% off.

20% off.

Should I go rescue
the new girl?

Do you want him in here?

I finished season 3 last night.

Ooh, I told you
it was addicting.

Yeah.

I'm going to hold on to the
DVD player a little longer.

Oh, well, just make
sure you bring it back

before we sell out.

I'm thinking of
becoming a profiler.

Wow, they started a new
semester down at the college.

Yeah, no.

Or, or you could use all of
those as semester class.

Or maybe I can find a way to
get these guys back together.

Ooh, you don't want
to be a profiler,

you want to be a
little matchmaker.

It's kind of the same thing.

I mean, they're
already a match,

if they just
communicated then

they'd still be together.

Maybe they just
need a little nudge.

You know my favorite
episode?

Season 4, episode 6.

Thank you.

Why, yes ma'am.

We do have a limited
selection of Barry Manilow.

Marketing.

I will keep him on track,

he just needs a
little direction.

God, you're an angel.

An angel.

I told him there is
no "The" in Twitter.

Straight from heaven.

Does he know about TikTok?

He doesn't.

He won't.

He must never know.

You catch more
flies with honey.

You're on a dating app?

No.

Then how do you know
about this stuff?

I'm a detective.

No, no Boomer, that's it.

Let me see these.

That's a lot on a
single piece of paper.

Like I'm getting dizzy.

You didn't even
finish this one.

Just not photogenic.

Is that makeup?

I mean

Mascara, eye shadow?

Who are those for?

No one.

I watched that episode that
you told me about, so good.

The one where they set
up the fake dating app.

Yeah.

Yeah, and then you take
selfies, with makeup.

Hey Miss Davis, hi Jimi.

You better start
calling me Junie Mae.

Yes ma'am, Junie Mae.

I, I'm going to check
on that Game Boy.

Hey Aiden.

Hey.

I saw your car outside.

Yeah.

Wait, you parked
outside again?

Yeah.

Um, this is Jimi,
and Junie Mae.

Sara.

Nice to meet you.

Junie Mae, Sara, Jenny.

It's Jimi.

Oh, like a boy's name?

Her, her grandparents,
they live at Woodstock.

Fun story.

So I'm Wren.

Oh, like psychotic chihuahua?

No, like the bird.

We've actually met on
campus a few times.

So you are coming to the
press party this weekend.

All right.

If you have any plans
literally cancel

because it's going to be epic.

So text me really quick.

Like the bird.

Right?

Right.

And I will text you back.

All right Wren, got it.

Going to be a soup spun.

Well, thanks Wren.

I will try to stop by.

I'll literally be devastated
if you don't show up.

Okay, bye.

Bye.

It is my firm belief that
she is still talking.

Literally.

Really?

All right, well, I got to
go, I am late for class.

So see you guys.

Bye.

Watch out for cuckoo birds.

How do I do that?

Say the things
you want to say?

Yeah, like that.

Well, I was a preemie.

So my filters never
fully developed.

I mean, don't you get scared?

Scared, me?

No.

Yes, 100%.

But you got to put
yourself out there

because honestly,
everyone is scared.

That girl wasn't scared.

Trust me, she's a
fraidy a cat.

Plus I'm having a
good hair day, so--

Rob, I think we've
got something.

Like a fly all ready.

Hey, let me buy you a drink.

No, thank you, I'm just looking.

I'll catch up on that.

I'll wait here, see
how everything is.

And then I'm going to
take her to her house

and then I'll come home.

I can't believe that
I didn't see her.

I'll text you or call
you and let you know.

I don't know how
I didn't see her.

Scooch out of the way.

I have our new
YouTube channel.

Mm-hmm, he set it
up last night.

Uh, you binge watching
our show all night?

What?

Oh, yeah, uh, so great.

Um, I'm going to take the
rest of the day off.

Sure.

Bye.

So carly.

I shouldn't have
suggested that episode.

Which?

The one with the dating app.

Is Jimi here?

No, she's not.

Help you boys
or something?

Uh, no, just looking around.

We have a BOGO in
our boring section.

Come on, I'll show you.

Size wise, I'm going
to guess extra basic.

Let's try that, come ne.

Uh, you want some
unsolicited advice?

Actually, yes,
I would love that.

Well, with that girl,
you have to communicate.

I just, I never really know
what to say to her.

Like, just got so much stuff
going on in my life

it feels like it's kind of
all over the road.

Sometimes saying
nothing is Okay, you just

have to communicate
with your actions.

I mean, Jimi listens
to what people say,

but she believes what
they actually do.

You should market yourself.

Got it.

It isn't always what you say,

sometimes it's what you do.

So what's with the leg?

Oh, uh, I, I just had a
mishap on my bike.

And I went to the
Doctor's and they

said that it's
just my knee,

I'll be fine in a
couple of days.

A couple of days, huj?

Hmm.

So this is the property I
was texting you about.

You bought this?

I did.

Best real estate out there.

Wow, the family farm.

That's the real real.

So where's mom?

Colorado.

Dad and company
tomorrow night.

I want your life.

I'm heading that way if
you want to come with,

mom would love to see you.

It's tempting.

You guys amaze me.

So what about you?

What's the dude situation?

College boys are back in town.

Yeah, no.

He has no idea how
to communicate.

He?

Yeah.

Well, I mean, no, you know,
like no one communicate.

Some people communicate,

some people are
putting off a vibe.

And if you care
about someone,

you can hear them even
when they're quiet.

That is the real real.

You got it.

I got it.

We need better SEO
for our website.

If Junie Mae is the CEO,
I can be the SEO.

Okay, look at me.

Yeah, Vulcan mind meld.

Okay, SEO is not a person.

I miss that Star Trek.

Trek?

OK, Vulcan mind meld
is from Star Trek.

Isn't that what I said?

You have your car, right?

Let's go on a trip.

I'll go grab my stuff.

So how was the
motorcycle ride?

Amazing.

You being careful?

Yeah, I wear a helmet.

I meant the biker.

He may be a little
old for me.

Yeah, I didn't see
his face, but--

That guy is one of the
most successful real estate

investors in the country.

So he's got money?

He still seems to be a little--

Like he could be my dad?

That was John Whyte?

The one and only.

Just crisscrossing the
country, living life.

Oh,

Okay.

Wow, I mean, I thought--

So the dating app,
you are not on--

No, I am.

I set it up like the
Profilers did, one for Liz,

one for Steve.

The Real Real
millionaire.

Nice looking beard.

Oh, Okay.

Well,

Oh God.

So how's it going?

I think I'm going to
have to figure out

what made them want to be
together in the beginning.

I don't know.

There are always clues.

You'll find them.

Alrighty.

Boomer, come on.

We are going on a CBD run.

You guys need anything for
aches, pains, comprehension?

No thanks, I'm good.

OK, he'll be in
around noon tomorrow.

Or so.

My phone.

Will you see who that is?

Yeah, I got it.

Thank you.

You're on a dating app?

Yeah.

Well, you got an
invite to join, look.

What is this?

Oh it looks interesting.

Come here, look, you
got an invite to join.

Don't click on it,
that's how they get you.

Unwrap the possibility.

The last thing I need.

No, it's exactly what you need.

Look, so you answer
like 10 questions

and you don't even get to see
their pictures or anything

until you've chatted with them.

Just will you please
unsubscribe me or whatever?

I don't, I don't want to
be on there.

Thank you.

Like really do it?

Yep.

Thank you.

Done.

Will you give me
the blew please.

The blew, like there's one.

You love what you do.

Um, I was out for a ride,
and I and I saw your car.

Just thought I'd say, hello,
I have your DoorDash delivery

in my car.

Hi, Hi Aiden.

Can we talk?

Hey.

Hey.

Oh, question, are these
glasses too quirky or does

it give like,
a Clark Kent vibe?

I think I have the
wrong house, I'm sorry.

No, I mean, who are
you looking for?

Aiden.

Aiden, no he's um--

He's not here.

He's like um, he's gone.

Well, I'm Jimi.

Uh, he comes into the
store where I work.

Oh, you're the, you're the
talky retro chick, Okay.

I'm his roommate.

Um, my-- I'm Connor,
people call me Con-man.

Um, do when he'll be back?

Uh, no.

Um, but you could text him.

I mean, he said that
he left you his number?

Well, yeah, um, he gave it
to the store, he's been

waiting for a
Game Boy to come in.

So do you want to,
do you want to come in, or?

Oh, no, thank you.

Um, no, I'll just,
I'll just text him.

Or would you have him
text me when he gets back?

Yeah.

He doesn't have
your number though.

So--

Would you mind
giving it to him?

Sure, yeah.

What is it?

Do you want to like write
it down or something?

No, it's cool.

I have a, I have a
photogenic memory.

Photographic.

Yeah.

Do I need to see like a
photograph for that to work?

TouchÃ© Jimi, touchÃ©.

Grab my phone.

Uh, it's 842-04--

Hold on a second.

Okay.

I got the 8.

Um, 4

Got a 4


Got a 2.








7.

842-0467.

Great, I got it.

All right. Um--

Cut. Cool?

Well, it was nice to
meet you, Con-man.

Interesting to meet you, Jimi.

Okay.

Okay.

Hey?

Good morning sunshine.

Any Game Boys come in?

No.

But when it does, you'll
be the third to know.

I'm going to let you text.

Thanks.

Has he even been in lately?

I haven't seen it
for a few days.

Wait, when?

Uh, the day after the press
opening, the day your dad

came to see you.

So what did he say?

Was, was he looking
for his game?

You know he doesn't say much.

Asked if you were here,
didn't bring up the Game Boy.

Oh, really?

Mm-hmm.

Cool.

What do you think
of her records?

Not much, a little
childhood trauma.

Where did she grow up?

Denver.

She went back.

That's the closure?

It's where she feels safe.

He has no social media.

He has no Snapchat, his
roommate hasn't seen him.

He doesn't even
have his phone.

Wait, his roommate?

Con-man.

Jimi, wasn't going
to see you there.

What are you-- how are you?

I'm Connor,
I'm a uh, shopaholic.

Hi Connor.

Um, no, I came, I came
by to tell you that

uh, Aiden's phone died.

Oh.

My hair, being one of
my better qualities,

I always have trouble
figuring out what kind of hats

I need to wear.

What, what are your
thoughts on this?

Uh, you do have a
great head of hair.

So no hat?

I say just let the
hair do its thing.

My hair is very independent.

You know, sometimes
I look in the mirror,

and I think, wow, the
hair is wearing me.

Hey dude?

Sara, are you stalking me?

Yes.

You know I actually got
this internship just

hoping that randomly one
day you would stroll in,

looking for hats.

Oh, right, right, right,
Um, the marketing thing.

Thing, major.

Hey, uh, what's the sitch
on your roommate?

Yeah.

His dad passed when
he was a little dude,

and um, his mom started
tripping, lots of drugs.

He's kind of the parent,
you know.

No, I didn't know that.

I think I'm going
to get these shades.

Just going to have
you plug-in your info.

Part of our new marketing
initiative, like my major.

I look forward to the spam mail.

Absolutely.

Oh, I can take those from you.

We can go bring you up front.

Thank you Jimi.

All right, keep the change.

All right Jimi.

Well, I'm going to
skedaddle, but let

me know if you hear
from Aiden, all right?

Oh hey, maybe, maybe that
hot blonde that

picked him up the other
day knows where he is.

Wait, what? What hot blonde?

Yeah, she drove
up the other day,

he ran to the street
corner and hopped in,

hopped in her car
with her.

I mean, she's not like
you're kind of hot,

she's hot like um--

She, she works it.

I'm not working it.

Well, I'm going to,
I'm going to go, got class.

See you later Jimi.

Stock me later serendipity do.

You know it Con-man.

The legendary Con-man.

You know the Con-man?

Oh yeah.

Everybody on campus
knows the Con-man.

Okay, he's been there
like eight years.

He changes his major
every year, gets

all the scholarship offers

so he can live in the
same apartment,

stay on campus, and then
he gets a new roommate

from the campus housing
website every year.

Con-man, I get it now.

He likes you.

Me?

Mm-hmm.

He wouldn't have come in
here if he didn't want

to help you with your dude.

Candidate.

Candidate.

Candidate.

Okay, so you need
to decompress.

I know this kick ass
place, it's called the sea.

It's like an 8 minute
bike ride from here.

I'll text you the
directions, Okay?

Now go, decompress.

Hi.

Hi.

Can I help you find anything?

Bags maybe.

Well, I actually brought
one in a few months ago,

but I don't see it.

Are you looking for
that bag in particular

or something different?

I kind of liked that one, and
I've been missing it lately.

Well, we might have sold it.

That bag needed a second
chance after my luck.

Something new might be fun.

Is it for a special occasion?

Possibly.

Hey girl.

Oh, it's so good to see you.

Oh, likewise.

Hey, that bag that I brought in.

Oh gosh, a lovely young lady
took that a few weeks ago.

Seemed like the
perfect fit for her.

So, are things getting better?

I've been on a dating app.

Eno signed me up.

Well, I never pegged you
for the online dating type.

Me neither.

I've met a few
interesting guys on there.

The app won't let you
see their profile picture

until you chat first.

Any front runner?

I think so.

I could use some new in my life.

Oh, well, like I always say,
with a fresh set of eyes,

all of it can become new.

True, very true.

I'm not feeling
any of these bags.

Oh, check back in a day or two.

Oh I will, I love this place.

It was really good
to see you Junie Mae.

You too Liz.

There are some people
who can't live alone.

They crave that
human connection.

Our mom was that way.

Aiden and I are both that way.

And she taught us about
that human connection.

Someone told me recently
that it's not what you say,

but it's what you
do that counts.

Our mom lived her life that way.

All of us were better for it.

She loved us, she
loved all of you.

I'm at your house.

It's me again--

Hey, are you Liz?

No, I'm, I'm not.

Well, hi, I'm not Will.

You don't look anything
like your pictures.

Just two?

Two, yes.

Please.

It's Okay.

Thank you for calling
me, I--today's just--

I have no idea
what's going on.

Well, it appears
you and I are fired,

and that your internship
has been revoked.

What happened?

She gives most of her
profits to a women's shelter

to help them keep the
doors open because

of what she went through.

Oh my God.

More heart than
business sense.

But they can't just put a vape
shop in there, that's just--

The bank has it tentatively
sold to some people

from the college, rich
kids, daddy's money.

I'm sure it'll be closed
again in a couple of months.

It's those two basic
dudes, with a camera.

So what's going to
happen to our stuff?

It says we only have
a week to get it out.

Got a van coming, going to
get us some storage spaces.

We can't just let this happen.

It's a lot harder on Junie Mae.

So where even is she?

She left the day
before they came,

she just couldn't stand to
watch them lock the doors.

She's gone to see her
family in Fort Smith.

So everyone's just disappearing.

Did you ever find Aiden?

He'll be back, and
Junie Mae will too.

Oh my God.

Boomer, when did
you do all this?

We have been working
on it a little bit

every day since I started.

So how's it going?

Well, we've got sales from
Facebook, from the Twitter,

from YouTube, and the Gram.

And it deposits in our
account in two days.

I can't believe it.

And it covers some of
the cash that we've

been short on our deposits.

Is it enough to
stop foreclosure.

We're $8,000 behind
at the bank,

and this will get
us halfway there.

And our projections
will show them

that we're capable
of catching up.

What do you mean that
we're short on cash

on our deposits?

Everything hasn't added
up between our sales

and our deposits in
the last few weeks.

I'm sure it's Junie
Mae's accounting system.

I have a meeting at
the bank tomorrow,

and this should
get our store back.

You are a marketing genius.

Finally.

Thank you.

No promises.

Can we call Junie Mae?

See how it goes at the
bank, then we'll call her.

Agreed.

Mr. Anderson is
ready for you now.

Okay.

Just follow me
up these stairs.

He's just inside the door.

Thank you.

Boomer, how the hell are you?

You'll see.

What you got for me today?

Actually some good news.

Anything I can
get you gentlemen?

No, we're fine, thank you.

Alrighty.

We've been doing a
little online sales,

and the numbers
look pretty good.

That amount deposits
in the bank tonight

which will get us
about halfway there.

And our projections
for the fourth quarter

show us catching up, and
even a little bit ahead.

All we need is to get the
lease back in Junie Mae's name,

and get these
payments caught up.

Well, I don't think we
can help you on this

one at this point Boomer.

Our projections are made on
the last 60 days of selling.

And we have Black Friday
and Cyber Monday next month,

and that should put
us over the top.

It just doesn't
work that simple.

What do you mean?

You see, the new owners,
big contributors here,

on the Board of Regents at
the school, you understand.

Oh.

They want to do
this for their kids.

Get them in business
for themselves,

give them an opportunity
to learn something,

you've probably seen them
around, they've been in,

take a few pictures.

Well, we'll be
hiring pretty soon.

Yeah, Boomer it's just
not going to happen.

I mean, I could call,

but I know exactly what
he's going to say.

Would you?

Call him?

It's important to
a lot of people.

Bill?

Nate over at the bank.

Yeah, I've got Boomer from
second chances sitting

across the table
from me right now,

he's got a financial proposal.

No, I realize that.

It's already been signed, but
there are a few days to remedy.

No.

No.

No we don't need to do that.

We'll, move forward.

All right, we appreciate
your business.

Like I said Boomer,
there's nothing I can do.

Well, if you change
your mind--

Hey, how'd it go?

I gave it my best shot,
I even knew the banker.

I made a very, very
reasonable presentation,

and it just didn't go.

You showed them like everything
you showed me last night

though, right?

Yes I did.

I laid it out all
in front of him,

and he just didn't get it.

But we had the money.

We still do, it just
didn't add up to him.

Okay, so what are
we going to do?

Lessons of love
to learn yourself.

You know, a lot of
magic can come out

of one of these things.

Come right in, here.

Thirsty?

Um, some water.

Thanks.

I know Boomer told you
everything, what was going on.

I'm really sorry for leaving
you hanging for a few days.

I just had to get out of there.

I just couldn't stand
to see them come in

and take everything away.

I just wish you would have
told me, about everything.

Remember all of our talks
about communication.

Yeah, it's been hard.

So many people
rely on that store.

I have let so many
people down.

No, you haven't.

You've, you've been there
for so many people for

so many years, including me.

You're my best friend.

I pray every night that
there would be some way.

So how are you?

Any Aiden updates?

I don't know what's
going on honestly.

I have no idea.

But um, my dad rode into town
this week and surprised me.

He said if I'm just
spinning my wheels,

I might as well make it count.

So he invited me to go on
the road with him and mom.

He says it might help to
see new places and faces.

Oh, oh no.

No, no, you are not
leaving me here.

No, either you stay or he's
going to need a sidecar.

What will I do without you?

What you always
do, be incredible.

Well, get dressed,
we're going out tonight.

Okay.

I'm going to go
home and get ready,

and you'll swing by and
pick me up at 7:00 PM.

And wear something vintage.

I'm always over drunk.

Nice party.

Well, look who it is.

Hey guys, I'm going
to go get a drink.

So glad they're reopening.

Yeah, I was literally lost
when I heard they were closing.

So um, what have
you been up to?

Work, you know,
not much else.

You?

You know me, I'm always full
tilt. TV, plate of spaghetti,

sweatpants.

I haven't been able
to master spaghetti,

but I got the sweat pants-TV
thing down real good

How's your girl?

I love her.

What in God's name?

My dear old friend.

I don't even know
what to ask first.

We found a way for us to get
our store back and all of this.

Found us a new investor.

Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr White.

Welcome to Oklahoma
Commerce Bank.

No more lease, both
spaces paid for,

these two are all ours.

I don't have the words.

And all these people are
friends and customers.

How did you get
everyone here?

I'm going to need someone
to run the new space.

Will you stay?

Hey mama.

And you can bring on
your own marketer.

Deal.

Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

Oh my pleasure.

It does my heart
good my one.

Oh, your donations
to this shelter

means so much to everyone.

Some months we couldn't
even have stayed open

if it wasn't for
your generosity.

Oh, the credit goes
to these angels here.

Thank you, we wouldn't
have been able to help

so many people
without your support,

it means so much
to these ladies.

Jimi, Con-man, Connor.

So yeah, I just
wanted to give you

the score on that hot blonde.

Was just chatting with Aiden
and dude, that's his sister.

Their mom died, funeral
and stuff, you know, so--

That sucks.

Later.

Hey.

I, I just got a voicemail
from your roommate

about your mom and your
sister, I'm so sorry.

We can talk about that later.

I really just wanted
to come ask if you

want to go on a date with me.

You know, like an actual date.

Yeah, yeah, Okay.

When were you thinking?

Now.

Now?

Now.

These are the three key
elements of marketing--

Look who's here.

Oh, hello?

Wren, is it?

I would like to introduce
you to my niece,

Wren She's an actor.

It's nice to meet
you Junie Mae.

I've heard so much about
you from Uncle Boom.

Oh, you're just
full of surprises.

I fly back to LA today,

so I wanted to come
in and meet you

for real this time.

She's good, isn't she?

I'll say.

Now, you know Junie Mae
used to live in Hollywood.

Boomer, don't go
telling stories.

Were you an actor?

She was a writer.

Really?

What'd you write?

She was the lead writer
on Criminal Profiles.

You wrote that?

I love that show.

Well, there were a lot
of writers on that show.

She's been working on a new
episode for next season.

Well, I'm sure
they'll love it.

Oh, and she writes
love letters.

I found an early draft
when I was carrying out

the trash several weeks ago.

You should write more, that
show is so binge worthy.

Thank you Wren--

You're welcome.

--so nice of you.

Thanks again uncle Boomer
for the acting job.

And I hope things
work out with Jimi.

That guy Aiden
really likes her.

I'll walk you out.

Bye.

My dad told me he got
our buildings back for us

because he wanted our store
to be a beacon of light,

a constant reminder that second
chances happen every day.

And then he leaned
in and whispered,

"But you'll never
get a second chance

if you don't take
the first one."

And that's the real real.
