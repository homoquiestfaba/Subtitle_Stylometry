Plenty of police cruisers out.
We can knock off.

Come on.

We're NSA, field work isn't our job.
Let's go home.

I want dinner and a hot bath
waiting for me.

And wear that black G-string.

I told you, I love you.
I'm not in love with you.

Why look for a stolen van?

Talk to the locals,
maybe they saw something.

Not that anybody here
ever sees anything.

Hey, I grew up in this kind
of neighbourhood.

And how often did you help out
the cops?

Look.

Clear.

Nothing.

Looks like you been here a while.

Yeah. It's my thinking place.

See anyone leave that van
while you were thinking?

Maybe her?

Your approach sucks.

You never heard
of positive reinforcement?

You know, the reward system?

What are you doing?

What are you doing?

Is that positive enough for you,
or do you want me to reinforce you?

Okay, okay.

Up there, the light. The light.

All right?

Shit.

Shit.

Shit!

Wait.

Government agents!
Get your hands up!

Get up with your hands raised...

...or I'll blow your brains
all over the wall.

Get up!

Get up! And stop fucking laughing.

<i>Put your dick down
and pick up the phone. You there?</i>

<i>Don't forget about dinner.
Gina's having London broil.</i>

<i>If you put ketchup on it,
she'll kill you, then me.</i>

<i>Don't let me down, partner.</i>

<i>See you, buddy.</i>

<i>Informing upon your enemy
makes them your friend.</i>

<i>That which we cannot speak about,
we must pass over in silence.</i>

Section chief, please.

<i>The open hand cannot grasp discipline.</i>

Section chief, please.
Steven Grant is present.

<i>Fine. Steven Grant has
clearance. I'll be down.</i>

Thank you.

<i>The open hand cannot grasp discipline.</i>

The Capitol saw your report.

Yeah. I was expecting this.
No.

You weren't expecting this.

<i>Informing on your enemy
makes them your friend.</i>

Comrade.

<i>Privacy is illusion.</i>

<i>Two steps forward...</i>

<i>...half a step back.</i>

Mr. Grant, Arthur Kellman, director
of the National Security Agency.

Mr. Grant, meet John Seward,
deputy chief of Central Security.

Good to see you healthy.

And officer Aaron Gray.
Pleasure to meet you.

We read the report.
I know it's unreal.

We believe you.

Maybe we should
show him the videotape.

That's why we believe you.
You caught him!

Not him.
That's not the man you fought.

It has to be. How many
have teeth like that?

Roughly 4000, worldwide,
as far as we can discover.

You're shitting me big time.

Now, gentlemen, please follow me.

It's a genetic offshoot of humanity.
An evolutionary mutation.

Their lifespan is measured
in hundreds of years.

They're incredibly strong. Any
nonfatal wound heals in seconds.

And they need blood to survive.
Dr. Bathory.

The victim: female, Caucasian,
22 years old...

...found hanging with bound hands
and feet and clothes ripped.

Symmetrical lacerations
across the neck...

...severing the carotid artery
and the jugular veins.

The tissue is frayed as if torn...

...not sheared, as you'd expect
with a knife or blade.

The x-rays show crush fractures
of the carpals.

Anything else, doctor?

There are six victims
with one thing in common:

Perforations of the esophagus,
with multiple lacerations.

In plain English, their throats were
ripped out and their blood drained.

Their reflexes, movements
are so much faster than ours.

They exist in an uncanny world,
a parallel universe.

They can blend in like an ordinary
human, unless they choose not to.

Vampires?

They're a cell mutation of the human
species, a different kind of breed.

And there are 4000 of these things?
Yeah.

How do we get rid of them?
We don't. They're not hostile.

They revealed themselves to us
last year.

"Not hostile."

The one that killed my partner
was pretty damn hostile!

He was a renegade. A deviant.

There's vampires who ain't deviant?

Their desires are no different
than most people's.

Safety, security...
Blood.

We don't feed on human blood.
We've developed a synthetic substitute.

We? We?

Promise me you just didn't
fucking say 'we.'

What makes you such a goddamn expert?

You haven't told him.

Hold it, Grant.
Aaron, would you step outside?

We were hoping you'd work with him.

They're immune to virtually all
disease, and that's only a start.

The potential benefits of integrating
with them are incalculable.

Don't think we've done
this casually.

We've taken all necessary precautions
in controlling their population.

What precautions?
That's classified.

But that is until we see your
willingness to fit into this project.

I've got to fit in with them?

If a Puerto Rican had killed your
partner, you'd exterminate them all?

Puerto Ricans don't bench-press
trucks! Or drink blood.

Neither do they.
They've evolved.

Increasing their population by turning
humans into vampires is suicide.

I don't think you want
someone else to find Phil's killer.

Aaron is the best man
in their police force.

He wants this killer
as badly as you do.

You must get that a lot.

Sometimes.

This must have come as quite a shock.
Do me a favour.

Don't try to be my pal.
Let's just go to work.

Phil got bit in the neck.

There's no way he'll become
one of you, is there?

For one to be transformed,
there must be an exchange of blood.

Even when that happens, 20% of the
population is naturally immune.

Don't worry, unintentional infection
is minimal.

You actually fought him,
and you're still alive.

I am impressed.

Well, you just made my day.

Did anything strike you as unusual,
aside from the obvious?

Actually, yeah.

He's killed six others.
No eyewitnesses, nothing.

This time there's an eyewitness.

He parked his van in plain sight.

Could be he got careless...

...or wanted to get caught.

Not necessarily caught, but seen.

This is a critical time for us.

We've just revealed our existence
to you.

It's a decision
not all of us supported.

Someone may not want an alliance
with humanity to succeed.

And that someone...

...has still got a taste
for the real thing.

It's broad fucking daylight.

Aren't you supposed to be
bursting into flames?

That only happens in movies.

We prefer night. The sun's a minor
irritant. That's why I wear glasses.

Well, I do like the shades.

You wanted to go over your notes.
Yes. They're at headquarters.

Where's that? Transylvania?

You should be
in the movies, Mr. Grant.

"Serenity"? You've gotta be kidding.

Definitely worth the trip.

Hungry, Mr. Grant?

I bet they make
a great blood sausage.

<i>...a sixth consecutive
murder victim...</i>

<i>...killed in the same horrifying
manner as the rest.</i>

<i>Throat brutally cut...</i>

<i>...and all blood drained
from the body.</i>

<i>Police continue to say they have
promising leads...</i>

<i>...but public outcry is growing
with each new killing.</i>

<i>This is Arthuria Homer...</i>

<i>...with a special news bulletin.</i>

My son!

Get your hands off my son!

Back off fucker!

You are scaring my son!

You shouldn't bring him here.

Go. Go!
Get him out of here.

It's all right.

It's all right.
Get out!

The boy is fine.

Are you satisfied?

Look, man, I thought the kid...

I know exactly what you thought.

What were you thinking
bringing me here?

They don't need some racist cop
throwing his weight around.

Racist? You calling me a racist?

You. Humanity.

"Made in God's image."

You're all so arrogant.

Let's just go to work.

Who's this?

One of many suspects. Excuse me,
everything is in specific order.

Look, man, if we're gonna
be working together...

...we have to be straight up
with each other.

Is that right?

Some plants would
brighten up the place.

I didn't know you were a comedian,
Mr. Grant.

The handcuffs are silver.
The bullets, silver-jacketed.

Isn't that expensive?

We're allergic to silver. The wounds
won't heal until the bullet's removed.

What the fuck is this?

Prison cells.

Made of plastic compound.

They can withstand high explosives.

Bars are too easy to bend.

No guests?

These are set aside for violent
criminals. Murderers.

No stake through the heart?

This is not the movies.
And up until now...

...we have had no use for either.

We are a very peaceful people.

I've looked forward to meeting you.
Who are you?

The name is Cross.

Dr. Cross.

I founded this town.

Let's compare notes, shall we?

I reviewed the autopsy
on the latest victim.

No forensic evidence.

Her throat was cut with a knife.
My partner's wasn't.

We couldn't get a dental imprint.
He was careful not to bite them.

He just used his fangs.

The effect was the same
as if he had used forceps.

It's possible that the
killings are politically motivated.

Almost certainly.

This is not the work of a man
who is in a grip of blood lust.

Our synthetic substitute
stamped out that behaviour...

...years ago.

No. The being who perpetrated
these horrible crimes...

...is deliberately defying
our community.

Making a statement.

You must understand, Agent Grant,
our people are afraid.

We are an easy target
for human paranoia here.

It's what you wanted.

I advocated coming forward.
I said we'd be safe.

Help us find the rogue
before it's too late...

...and my people are punished
unfairly.

This disk...

...contains a database...

...of all known vampires worldwide.

Sir, I can handle that.

I'll be in the car.

You can't give them names.
We have to trust each other.

With our lives.

<i>Privacy is illusion.
Trust authority.</i>

Cross has made overtures
for months about this information.

How did you persuade him?

He just gave it to me.
But why?

God knows. Maybe he really wants
what's best for his people.

The bad news is, I don't have faith
in them like he does.

We spoke of precautions.

After the work you put in,
you deserve a look.

<i>Existence proceeds essence.</i>

<i>Nothing is true.
Everything is permitted.</i>

Fleming.

Damn it!

Dr. Fleming, Agent Grant.
Grant is our field man.

Show him why we aren't worried
about tracking them.

Here's a sample of their blood...

...infected with a deadly
airborne virus we have created...

Highly contagious.

What will it do to humans?

Very little.

The lab tests are done, and volunteers
have started the human trials.

The human effect is only mild
flu-like symptoms.

That's as bad as it should get.
The vampire effect...

...is rather like...

...the Ebola virus.

<i>Agent Grant, report to 71st Street.
The Freudian Building.</i>

Right. Her name's Barbara Steel.

Died around 4:30 a. m.
Sophomore at the university.

Christ! Kellman's daughter
goes there.

Apartment's owned by Graf Orlock,
psychiatrist. He saw patients there.

Anybody locate him yet?
Nope.

We put out an APB,
but nobody's seen him in 3 days.

Anybody see her come in?
Doorman? Security camera?

No. That's what I don't get.

There's security cameras everywhere.
In the lobby, on the roof.

We reviewed the tapes, but nothing.

One of Orlock's patients?

No idea. His appointment book
is missing.

Sewage.

Is there a way to the sewers?

There's a drain down in the basement,
I think.

The superintendent,
he can tell you more.

But I tell you:

If the killer got in that way, he
must be some kind of Olympic acrobat.

So, is this Orlock one of you?

Yes.

When were you gonna tell me?

Orlock didn't kill that poor girl.
Why not?

He's one of Cross strongest
supporters. He has no motive.

Something you'll learn...

...sometimes being a sick fuck
is all the motive you need.

Hello?

Anybody home?

There's a book in the fire!

Aaron, where the fuck are you?

Shit! Shit! Aaron!

Get the book!

Fuck.

Come on, let's take this asshole!

He's gone.
All that was for nothing?

Not quite nothing.

It was him. The one who killed Phil.

Are you sure?

Your senses are heightened, right?
Did you recognize him?

His smell? Anything?
No.

The odour of burning flesh
overpowered everything else.

There are pages missing.
He was...

...ripping them out...

...and burning them individually...

...till he heard you coming
and threw the whole book in.

The leather protected it.
Most of the interior is intact.

Appointment next week.
"Albert P. 52." Who's Albert P.?

He wasn't planning on disappearing.
No. Exactly the opposite.

Any meetings today?
Lucy Westenra.

Somebody you know?

Thanks.

For what?

For saving my life.

Just doing my job.

If somebody saves your life,
don't act like it's nothing.

Wouldn't be human.
You're supposed to say something.

Supposed to give him his props.
Props?

What is "props"?
Proper respect.

R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

Ah, respect.

That's a big-ass house.

What is "big-ass"?

Excuse me.
It's time for his medicine.

What, the fucking cat's a vampire?

They're born killers, Lucy.

If you provoke them, they'll
act on their natural instincts.

I doubt your friend
finds that attitude reassuring.

You could say the same about us.

You're Steven Grant, aren't you?

The man who's going to save us
from ourselves.

Your name was in Orlock's book.

He's my therapist. I have a session.

When is the last time
you spoke to him?

When I made the appointment.

What do you know about
the dead girl in his apartment?

I didn't know there was one.

You don't sound surprised.

I didn't think this was a social call.

You think Orlock is your rogue?
Ridiculous. He has no motive.

I love the way everybody talks about
motive like it's a big mystery.

He got tired of decaf,
felt like sucking real blood.

Maybe he invited you
for a taste of the real thing.

I don't suck human blood,
Detective Grant.

And if I did, would I rob
some little college girl of hers?

No.

I'd hunt for some real red meat.

You have an alibi for 4:30 a. m.?

I was at an after-hours club.

That proves jack shit.

Since when must I prove anything
to you, detective?

Anyway, ask the owner.

His name is Boudreaux.

I was there from 2 until 6.

Here's the phone number.

So this came from that address?

Where'd you get this?

Orlock's apartment.

Interesting.

What is Orlock's connection
with Boudreaux?

It has to do with Orlock's habits.

He doesn't like to limit himself.

He's at the top of
my list of suspects.

So what's keeping us?

Miss, if you'd accompany us...

...you might be of assistance
in questioning Boudreaux.

Let me change my clothes.

She knows something.

She knows many things not
necessarily connected to our case.

She's trying to play me.

She's always like that.
There's no point in bringing her.

She's hiding something,
which means she's coming.

Which means we'll be here awhile.

Allow me.
Thank you.

I'll do the talking.
Anyone tell you your approach sucks?

I guess we're in.

Now, take us to Boudreaux.

Ready for the nightlife, Mr. Grant?

Be gone! You tamper with forces
far beyond your comprehension.

He didn't just say that.

Quit the Anne Rice routine.
We're not amused.

What can I say,
I got a great life.

The costume, the accent,
gets me all the ass I can handle.

If this is about sex and drugs,
I got no control over my clientele.

This time it's not about drugs,
my friend.

And it's not about sex.
It's about Graf Orlock.

He's missing.

Well, Orlock and I,
we have common interests.

We're not close. If he's not home,
I don't know what to say.

Boudreaux, you know better
than to lie to me.

Since you know him so well,
you can tell me...

...about the connection between him
and the murders.

Orlock's a pussy, not a killer.

That's what I told you.

What's a killer doing
hiding in his basement?

West.
Hello, Aaron.

Keep an eye on him.

His rap sheet was on your desk.
Feel like telling me who he is?

Keeping secrets from your partner,
Aaron?

Where's the trust?

His name is West.

He's leader of the opposition
to Cross.

He believes exposing ourselves
to humans is suicidal.

Not "believes."

Knows. I've seen witch hunts.

Slavery...

...the massacre of millions of Jews,
Aaron.

I realize that war between us
is inevitable.

Boudreaux?
Orlock!

Oh, crap.
Jesus!

He's mine. Cover West.

Come and get me, human.

Orlock?
Ah, shit!

Freeze, fucker!
Come and get me.

Stop laughing!

Fuck you!

You're all so pathetic. Humans!

Come and get me.

Allow me.
Let go! I'm too heavy!

Is everyone all right?

Everyone's fine.

Except West, he's dead.

Is he?

Yeah.

What the...?!

Going somewhere?

Damn it!

You'll be happy to know West got away,
though he won't get far.

But Orlock's dead. So...

Tell us what we want to know.
What were they doing here?

Go to hell.

Wrong answer?

I thrive on pain.
Well...

Steven, no.

Not feeling talkative, huh?
You still got one left.

No, wait! Wait! Wait!

Wait!

Orlock called, asked me to set up
a meeting with West.

Why?
I don't know. West didn't either.

Orlock was scared.
I've never heard him like that.

What was West planning?

Some big operation. A big deal.

He said he'd fill me in on it today.

Now none of us gets to find out.

Let me explain the concept
of "partners."

Why don't you?

Partners work together as a team.

They don't hold back information.

This West is a militant
revolutionary...

...who thinks that humans
are the great Satan.

And you decide
he's not worth mentioning.

He's been underground a long time.
It's strange he's here.

Great.

Any other leading citizens
you forgot to mention?

That's enough.

Maybe a Hitler type...
That's enough.

...who'd like to put us all in camps?

That's enough.

What?

I thought you might like to come in...

...to talk about the case.

Are you serious?

So let's talk about the case.

Is that why you're here?

If I knew,
I probably wouldn't be here.

I'm moved that you care at all
what I think.

Yeah, well, I should probably have
my head examined.

You are a top homicide detective.

The weight of the world
is on your shoulders.

We know from the way
you relate to women...

...you want to be a hero to them.
A protector.

But they scare you.
At some level, you hate them.

I'm going to say...

...abusive mother.
A younger sister you protected.

Am I right?

I'm sorry.

I don't know when to...

So you figured me out.

I guess we're done here.

Absolutely. All you have to do
is get by the cat.

Shit...

Any other way out of here?

I'm afraid not.

Locked in a house with a vampire.

I used to have nightmares like this
when I was a kid.

Whiskey.
Yes, sir.

I never did like the taste.

I owe you an apology.

The Hitler line.

No. We've all done things...

...we later regret.

I lost my family to the Nazis.

You're Jewish?
Yes. Polish.

Gray is an Anglicized name.

That was a long time ago...

...when the Nazis
took everything we had.

And I decided...

...my family would not be led
like sheep to be slaughtered.

So we fled...

...through the sewers...

...and into the forests.

But this was the middle of winter.

We escaped the soldiers...

...but not the cold.

When he found us...

...my wife and daughter were dead.

And I was close to following them.

He gave me life
and a reason to exist.

You want to die with your child...

...with your wife?

Or live, and take revenge?

I found them in a bar...

...drinking.

My daughter's body
was frozen to the ground.

And they were singing.

A Jew!

What do you want? You piece of shit!

You Jewish piece of shit!

Sounds like they got
what they deserved.

Everybody's got that rage
inside of them. Everybody.

It started as revenge...

...but then when
I tasted human blood...

...everything else was forgotten.

The blood lust took control.

And it was that moment...

...that I realized what was inside me.

What I'd become.

What's it like?

What?

Biting into flesh and finding blood.
Is it like getting high?

It's a place you never want to visit.

Come on. Let's go to work.

Graf Orlock
is one of Cross' lieutenants.

The other is Dean Fusco.

We have to find him.

What, here?

He has an attachment
to his family life.

This is the family crypt.
His mother's in there.

You know Italians and their mothers.

He's been here recently.
How do you know?

I can smell him.

Some of us gotta get by
on police work alone, pal.

Have you noticed anything strange?
Besides the obvious?

Every time we need a lead,
someone is willing to supply it.

The killer waits for you and
your partner to see his crime.

Then again at Orlock's,
tossing the book into the fire...

...knowing I'll be able to save it.

Why is he making it obvious
he's one of us?

Do you think we're
being led by the nose?

Are you saying this case
is too easy?

If the killer is smart enough to
use you, me and everyone else...

...it's far from easy.

I can't believe he doesn't fillet you.

He trusts me. I'm not sure
I can say the same for you.

You still flinch when I touch you.

And you're brooding about something
but you won't tell me what.

Sorry. It's hard to get used to.
What I am?

Trusting someone.

As for what's on my mind,
it's this case.

We've hit a wall.
We're trying to find this guy.

Dean Fusco.

Dean was turned in 1941.

He was always kind of stuck there.
The way he dressed and talked.

He always wanted to be a movie star,
but never made it.

Aaron said he was attached
to his human side.

Always visiting his mother's grave,
his old neighbourhood, his sister.

In disguise, watching the
people he knew grow old and die.

He was a very lonely man.

Son of a bitch!

His sister. Different last name.

Do you know her married name?

Yeah.

Solerno, Mary. She lives upstate.

If you found this rogue,
this killer...

...would it really make a difference?

Would it convince your leaders
to accept us?

If it doesn't, I will.

Fusco's sister owns a theatre
in the town they grew up in.

Lucy said she lives upstate.

We can check it out on the way.

Do you think this is a good idea?

Oh, come on, man!

I'm only human.

You go in and I'll circle around.

Are you kidding? He's a vampire.
No offense.

Okay, but he'll smell whoever
goes in first.

If it's me, he may run.
So?

Hopefully, he'll think
you're a homeless person.

Hopefully.

Hopefully.

Grim-visag'd war
hath smooth'd his wrinkled front.

See, see, where Christ's blood
streams in the firmament!

One drop would save me.

I must always walk alone.

And yet always I am followed.

Sound asleep and yet...
And yet I can hear it!

It's me! Pursuing myself.

Who the hell are you?
I'm a cop.

We had reports of a
break-in. Who are you?

Oh? I? Oh, my dear boy,
I am an actor.

I can be anyone I wish to be.

Well, you got any I.D.?
A driver's license?

Maybe an Academy Award?

I never leave home without it.

I know why you're here.

You're an errand boy sent by
shopkeepers to collect the bill.

I hear your heart beat faster
when you lie.

So, one more time.
Who the hell are you?

Take it easy.

Drop it!

Look what you're doing to my shirt!

Sit down! Sit down!

We can do this one of two ways.

My way, or my way.
Relax.

We want to know who you're
hiding from. Is it West?

West!

West is only part of it.
It goes much deeper than that.

You wouldn't believe
who's involved in this...!

Just start from the beginning.

You know, Aaron, not everybody
was wild about this...

...coming-out-of-the-closet routine.

Things were tense.
This made it worse.

You should have thought of that!

All right. All right.

Orlock heard West was back...

...and into something.

Smuggling? We didn't know.
We presumed weapons.

But West was still spouting
the same old revolutionary poop.

Would you just stick to the point?

We were supposed to find out more.

Orlock was supposed to tell Cross.

I guess he never got the chance.

He phoned me. He was scared.

He wouldn't talk on the phone.

He said we were in danger.
He told me to leave town...

...and he'd contact me.

He's dead.
He never did!

Why would Orlock meet with
West if he was afraid?

Maybe he wanted to cut the deal.

Yes, it's true. Orlock wasn't
the toughest guy in the world.

Being on the run was hard on him.

Something's missing.
You dug into West's operation.

Did you find anything?

Something about a shipment
coming in on the 20th.

Tomorrow?

Weapons smuggling.

With the money involved,
West can't pull this off alone.

Then somebody else
had to be involved. Who?

Somebody I thought I knew.

Come on. Come on, man.

Lucy. Lucy Westenra.

You're lying.

I'd know if he was.

It's all right.

We don't know the whole story.
You said it yourself.

When is this going down?
I don't know.

I don't even know how.

Planes, trucks...
It makes perfect sense!

She sends me
on a wild goose chase upstate...

...so I'm not around
for the shipment.

She distracted me
so West could escape.

She also saved your life.

She used me.
Why are you defending her?

I'm not.
Damn it!

I can't believe
she's involved in this.

If you report this,
they'll assume the worst.

Why shouldn't they?
We're trying to prevent war. Please!

Not until we've had the chance
to check it out.

"Albert P." isn't a person.
It stands for Albert Pier.

I came to the same conclusion.
We'll check it out.

If it's more than we can handle,
I'm calling it in.

Fair enough.

Grant's here right now.
I'll get back to you.

That's your official recommendation?
Hold off?

What's that supposed to mean?

Just what it says.

This looks more complicated
than just plain murder.

It's political.
They're fighting among themselves.

We don't have time for
conspiracy theories.

I agree with Mr. Grant.

If this is manipulation,
I want to know.

I thought we agreed.

You've got to let me get
to the bottom of this.

If you brought me in because you
wanted a stooge, you made a mistake.

What is the rush, Seward?
The virus can reach them anywhere.

Same thing as before? I'll go in
the side and you circle around.

As you wish.

This place stinks.
That's good.

It'll cover your approach.

Agent Grant. Get me Kellman.

Don't move unless I say.

<i>Sewards SWAT team's a bunch
of trigger-happy fuckers.</i>

<i> - Where are you?
Albert Pier, number 52.</i>

We'll be waiting.

Special forces are in position.

The ship will be here
in a few minutes.

Any questions?

I got a question for you.
How fucking stupid do you think I am?

Back off, fucker!

You don't understand.

I wanted to tell you.
I couldn't risk it.

I understand perfectly. You used me.

<i>Get Seward. Were moving in.</i>

<i>Where's Grant?</i>

Put the gun down.

I should have known
you were involved in this.

Don't be an idiot, Steven,
open your eyes.

Look! Fusco misled us.

It's not weapons.
People are being smuggled out.

Can't you see? My people are afraid.

Weapons? Is that what you thought?

You wouldn't let me tell him.
Look what almost happened.

Seward, you motherfucker!

I didn't give the word!

You betrayed us!

Traitor!

I've been waiting for this...

... for centuries.
Tell them to cease fire!

Get off!

Mama!

Save the kid!

Take him!
I'm going after his parents.

Move, move, move!

Hold your fire!

No, you're wounded.

It's nothing.

No, my blood.
I don't care!

What's going on?

How is she?
Stable.

The transfusion from Aaron helped.

She's not getting any worse.

But she isn't getting any better?

She's in a coma. But understand...

...our physiology is different
from yours.

The body goes
into a coma-like state...

...when it's severely damaged...

...as it attempts to heal itself.

She will fully recover.

What are her chances?

Twenty-five percent.

I have to get back to Serenity.

Half of my people are going
into hiding...

...the other half are arming
themselves.

It will take a lot of work
to clean up the mess you've made.

Is that her blood?

My God.

You could be infected.

You should check in here yourself.

And if I'm infected?

You'll transform...

...within three days.

Is there any way to stop it?

No.

What's the point of checking in?

There has to be some mistake.
You couldn't have shot my men!

Tell me I'm wrong, go ahead!

Tell me, goddamn it!

Your men weren't even scratched.
I shot at their body armour.

The only reason I didn't shoot them
in the head...

...was because it was
on your order.

I had to use my judgment.
You were in there a long time.

I was in there five minutes!

<i>Informing on your enemy
makes them your friend.</i>

I called you to tell you
you're going back to your old job.

The official story is
you're on medical leave.

Seward wanted to fire you, I said no.
He's too busy to fight, so...

Busy with what?

The situation's becoming untenable.

We're releasing the virus.
Not yet.

I'm close, damn it!

Last night another girl
disappeared from the university.

She is my daughter.

<i>We cant stop anyone from leaving.</i>

<i>Be sure they have enough
blood substitute to last.</i>

<i>We are at the lab.</i>

Good.

It's Steven Grant.

Tell him I'm busy.

He says it's urgent.

They're mixing up a big supply
of the virus...

...all over the world.

And I should trust you?

I screwed up. I know.

But you have to trust me.

Right now...

...your entire race is living
on borrowed time.

Why should I believe
this fantastic story?

Your senses are heightened.

You tell me if I'm lying.

We must do something.
Our people will all die.

So Agent Grant is going to steal
a sample of the virus?

Where is he planning
to get it from?

From Fleming's laboratory?

Yes. That's the name he used.

You knew of this?

I gave you your life.

And now, I'll take it.

You know, I really ought to thank you.

You just make everything so easy.

The incident at the pier was a gift.

Not only did it give us a perfect
chance to release the virus...

...but it got the slime
so worked up...

...they believed everything
I told them.

Your gun.

Give me your gun, slowly.

Well, you were sabotaging the virus.

You go for your gun...

...there's a struggle.

Et cetera. Et cetera.

Et cetera. Not original...

...but it works.

So the virus is lethal to humans.

There's that community-college
education coming into play.

I'm quite proud of it.

You see...

...the initial infection
with vampires...

...is quite severe,
and in humans quite mild.

But after a week,
the vampires recover...

...and the humans...

...die.

You're human.
Do you have an antidote?

Oh, no. No, it doesn't apply.

By the time the virus
is being released...

...I won't be human anymore.

He's going to turn me tonight.

Who?

You're not James Bond...

...and I'm not Blofeld.

No more explanations,
and no last-minute escapes.

How about no bullets?

Say something about my education now,
you fuck!

I knew you'd come.

I knew I could rely on you.

I promised...

...you'd never know disease,
weakness...

...or pain again.

And I intend to keep that promise.

I bled him dry.

He is starving.

I'm surprised that he's
been able to keep...

...from trying to attack you
this long.

It's all right.

I've sent everyone home.

We have time.

You will be pleased to know...

...that you won't be implicated
in Fleming's death.

His body will never be found.

Granted...

...questions might be asked.

But by tomorrow, their minds
will be on other things.

You will be dead...

...and I'll have given them
their rogue.

I'll have killed him, of course...

...but it's too late to keep you
from becoming his last victim.

Pity. I like you.

You have qualities
that most people today lack.

Determination...

...loyalty to friends...

...and partners.

It was you.

You killed Phil.

I took no pleasure in it.

Playing a murderer has been
extremely distasteful to me.

I'm not a violent man by nature.
Yeah, right.

All this talk
about peaceful coexistence...

...and all along...

...you're planning on
wiping out humanity.

Don't be ridiculous.

Civilization would collapse.

That's not what I want at all.

I already have a cure.

It's made from our blood.

And I plan to share it with humanity.

It will make people resistant
to the virus...

...to all disease.

One race.

I saw with my own eyes...

...what happened to the Indians,
the Africans, the Jews.

The only difference was race.

We can't fight you...

...but we can't trust you either.

This is the only way.

No!

Incredible!

I don't think I've ever seen
willpower like this!

Too bad. It's utterly pointless!

Go!

Excellent choice.

These silver bullets
are overkill on you.

But you will leave
an expensive corpse.

That's enough of that.

Goodbye.

That hurt.

Not bad for a final act.

But not quite good enough.

Hang in there.
Hang in there, partner.

I think we won.

The catastrophe that almost befell
us could only have been created...

...by mutual cooperation
between our two people.

And mutual cooperation is the only way
it could have been stopped.

We owe Steven Grant and Aaron Gray
a debt...

...for showing us that...

...for good or evil,
we are no different.

And I owe them a more personal debt
for my daughter's life.

I'm sorry I missed it.

Are you all right? You seem strange.

I got tested yesterday.

I'm not infected with your blood.

I never will be.

I'm immune.

One of the 20 percent.

I can never be like you.

Forty years from now...

...you won't have changed.

I'll be old...

...or dead.

I wasn't gonna tell you
till you got back on your feet.

I didn't want to upset you.

Why did you think I'd be upset?

Because I'll lose you in 40 years...

...or am I losing you now?

I just thought...
I mean, when you heard...

Do I strike you
as the kind of woman who...

...who...

...who takes the easy way out?

No.

Then the question is...

...are you that kind of man?

You know it won't be easy.

Nothing good ever is.

What's up?

They want us downtown.

I'll see you soon.

I'll be waiting.

You drive, partner.

Let's go to work.
