                <i> PAUL: Mmm-hmm.</i>

  <i> I canceled</i>
  <i> all the patients,</i>

  Fairfield County, ma'am.

          (KNOCK AT WINDOW)

            Hmm?

              Hi.

          I'm Susan Manning.
          I hope you're
          here to meet me.

                  Yes.

              Good.
                  Hop in.

        (CAR ENGINE STARTS)

              You know I thought
              it was gonna rain.

    Ah, the weather
    changes pretty fast
    in these parts.

                It's hot.

              Yup.

  So, you're the new nurse.

          If Dr. Quilly approves
          my credentials.

        Oh, he will.

                  Why is that?

  It's not easy to get
  new nurses way up here.

                      Oh.

        Miss Manning?

                  Yes.

        Come with me.

           So, how many patients
            do you have here?

    No patients here.

                What?

        Guests.

          Yes. Well, are you
          one of the...

      I'm Jones,
      head of security.

  Don't let my title bother you.

    I'm here for safety,
    both guests and staff.

  We do have rules.
  You will let me know
  of any violators.

      I am responsible.

              Of course.

    It's good to have
    a cooperative nurse
    this time.

              Ms. Donnymead will
              show you around.

              Who?
                  Ms. Donnymead.

        Administrative assistant
          to Dr. Quilly.

            At least, she likes
            to be called that.

          People like titles
          around here.

        You mean, like, um,
        head of security?

        (EXCLAIMS)

        You're lovely,
        Miss Manning!

    But then the
    superintendent, Dr. Quilly,
    said you would be.

          He claims to
          have an intuition
          about phone voices.

      Ms. Donnymead's
      affection for Dr. Quilly
    gets out of hands sometimes.

      Thank you, Mr. Jones.
      We'll meet you
      in the games room.

            Come with me.

        (PEOPLE CHATTERING)

  This is our games room.

  Guests, this is
  Nurse Manning,

  and she's come by
  to say hello.

               Hello. Thank you.

              I look forward to
              the opportunity of

              getting to know
              all of you better.

  Make yourself comfortable
  and I'll be back as soon
  as Dr. Quilly is ready.

       (IMITATES ENGINE REVVING)

  Oh! Good morning.

          No time to
          chitchat, Nurse.

      The world Olympics
      are soon gonna be upon us.

              Hello.

                Hi.

        This is an exact replica
          of the Fokker 33A.

              I made these.

          This little Fokker
          is the same plane

   that Baron Von Richtofen flew

          and was shot down in
          June 17th, 1918.

   Would you like to see it fly?

            Sure.

          And, look,
          I even made a little
          pilot to go inside.

      That's very nice.
      Very nice.

                Thank you.
          You're welcome.

            ...and through a
            field of roses to a
           many towered Camelot.

  You're a poet.

      No. It's a voice exercise.

        Oh.

              But I am a poet.

  I just love
  those hydrangeas.

  You know that you
  can make them pink
  or blue or white

  just depending on
  what plant food
  you give them.

  It's just
  such fun to...

                  Hello, ladies.

                The man with
               the baseball cap,
                is he a patient?

                I mean, a guest.

      Oh, no. No, that's
      Dr. Desmond Moore.

      He's more or less
      second in command
      to Dr. Quilly.

      He's an angel.
      He's an Adonis.

  But he's very professional.

  When I think
  about him I get wet.

                (CLEARS THROAT)

                Dr. Quilly, this
               is Susan Manning.

  Of course.
  Welcome, welcome!

      I'm so happy
      you found us.

              Thank you, Doctor.
    Won't you sit down?

  How about a
  nice cup of tea?

                  Oh, please.

  Ms. Donnymead,
  would you be kind?

  Again, Miss Manning,
  my condolences
  on your loss.

            Oh, I appreciate
            that, Doctor.

      I think it's
      almost an obscenity

      for a psychiatrist
      to commit suicide.

              Why any more
              than anyone else?

    Because of our
    responsibilities.

      Can you imagine the
      effect of a suicide on
      a doctor's patients?

                    Yes.

                  (GRUNTS)

          Not now, Henry.
          I'm busy.

    He's a brilliant
    make-up man.

    Quite comfortable
    to play anybody
    but himself.

          Have you kept
          in touch with your
        family and your friends?

          That can be a
          comfort, you know?

  No. I really wanted
  to get my life
  organized first.

  I have my
  credentials here.

            Oh, there's no
            real need for that.

          Here at the Institute
          we believe people are
          who they say they are.

              Now, Nurse, if you
              are to be with us

          I must ask that
          you put aside any
        preconditioned attitudes

          you may have
          as to the treatment
          of the insane.

  Oh, Dr. Quilly, a man
  with your reputation doesn't
  have to explain originality.

        Well, our theories
        are deceptively simple.

            Our guests...

       Well, they have fantasies
        that are not accepted

      in the so-called
      outside, real, sane world.

        But here, under extreme
        controlled situations,

          we allow them to
         act out their fantasies

                as if they were
                totally sane.

      Yes. I met some of
      your guests earlier.

        And we have found
        that if they get to
       exercise these fantasies,

          after a time they
          no longer need them.

            Now, I realize
            that takes a while,

          but there are no
          sudden therapies
          for the mad,

              so here
              at the Institute
              no one is mad.

                Uh, would you
                be willing to
               dress as a nurse?

  That's your prerogative.

  I really want
  this opportunity.

                Then I take it,
                Miss Manning,

      that you are prepared
      to commit to the Institute
      and all its values?

      Not only to the Institute,
      but to all its people.

                  Ah!

          Now I really believe
          you understand us.

          However, I will
          need a commitment.

              Your commitment.

            You have it.

                  Done and done.

      There is, I'm afraid,
      some boring paper work.

    Your withholding thing,
    your RN registration number
    and more ad nauseam.

    Such a gigantic bureaucracy
    for such a small formality.

  It's just as bad at home.

      Ms. Donnymead will fill in
      all the details

   from that letter you sent us.
   Why don't you just sign here?

          Ms. Donnymead's
        swamped with paper work.

      I can't tell you
      how excited I am.

  Uh, do you have
  a phone that I could use?
  Collect, of course.

  I want to call my family
  and tell them I'm all right,

      very all right,
      productive again.

          I'm sorry,
          I'm afraid we
          cannot have that.

  I promise it's collect.

      Miss Manning,
      you are not ready yet

        to upset your
        family and friends,
        not at all ready.

    Don't forget you have
    just committed yourself.

  I beg your pardon?
  Did you say committed?

  No, I'm here as a nurse.

          Of course you are.
          You are whatever
          you say you are.

        Don't you remember?
        I told you about
        our theories

          and you said you
          would commit to us.

    I meant committed
    in an entirely
    different context.

          I'm a nurse.

        A real nurse.

            If you want
            to be a nurse,
            be a nurse.

          Dr. Quilly,

    a person like you
    couldn't...

    Wouldn't make
    an error like this.

                True.

            (DOOR OPENS)

      I'm not staying here.

                  Oh, please,
                let us help you.

      (ELECTRICITY BUZZING)

        Pity.

       <i> QUILLY: Miss Manning,</i>
       <i> you're not ready yet</i>

         <i> to upset your</i>
         <i> family and friends.</i>

     <i> Don't forget you have</i>
     <i> just committed yourself.</i>

         <i> Would you be willing</i>
         <i> to dress as a nurse?</i>

        <i> Let us help you.</i>

           Hello. I'm Dr. Moore.

  Why was I locked up?

              Locked up?

              I think you've
              been dreaming.

  No, I wasn't dreaming.
  I was locked up in a room.

            Dr. Quilly has some
           interesting theories.

        He thinks that when
        people break the rules,

            they sometimes
            punish themselves
            in their dreams.

  Are you threatening me?

        No, of course not,
        Nurse Manning.

          I'm no threat to you
          and I'm sure you'll
          find that out.

          Whatever happened
          to you last night,
          even in the mind...

        It wasn't a dream!

        ...was very real to you,
        and very exhausting.

          Time for you to rest.
          We'll speak later.

    Son of a bitch!

  Oh! Good morning,
  Nurse Parker.

                  Parker?

  Oh, good grief.
  Miss Parker was the last...

      I'll tell Dr. Quilly
      you are here.

  Dr. Quilly is on the patio
  and he's anxious to see you.

        (BIRDS CHIRPING)

        Ah, Nurse Manning,
        do sit down and join us.

        Now, isn't this
        a simply lovely day?

  I don't have time
  for polite conversation.

    Oh, there's always time
    for polite conversation.

          At least sit down.

        Do you know our
        Dr. Moore here?

      We met briefly
      this morning and, yes,
      we'll visit frequently.

  No, we won't.

  Let me make this
  perfectly clear.

  If you have any
  question as to my
  legitimate business here,

  my credentials
  are in my purse.
  Do you have my purse?

        Of course.
        Jones found it
        out by the gate.

        You must have
        dropped it when...

        Well, never mind.
        It's found, dear.
        Here you are.

  My credentials are gone.

      You took them.

          Oh, Nurse Manning,
          why would I do

        such a cruel
        and ludicrous thing?

            Now, look at me.
            Am I a cruel man?

        Dr. Quilly.

  Would you
  please reconsider this
  whole, terrible mistake?

            Once committed,

        I cannot release you
        until I believe

          that you are a normal,
          healthy human being.

          Why did you
          commit yourself?

        I didn't!

  He handed me a form and
  he said that Ms. Donny...

  Whatever the hell her name is,

    would fill in the details.

      Are you in the habit
      of signing blank forms?

    Of course I'm not
    in the habit of
    signing blank forms.

  It just seemed so routine.
  We spoke on the phone.

    I was desperate
    for the job and...

              Desperate?

  Will you please help me?

          I'd like very much
          to help you.

  They put me in
  a basement room.

          Basement room?
          Can you take us there?

  No, I can't take you there.
  I don't know how I got there

  and I don't know
  who put me there.

            Basement room?

            But there is
            no basement room

          or anything like
          a basement room
          in this institute.

        Is there, Dr. Moore?

                  No.

        It's somewhere.

          Yes. It is somewhere.

              In the mind.

      In whose mind,
      Dr. Quilly?

      Yours or mine?

  (MAN MOANS)

           You're the new nurse.

               My name is David.

            David means beloved.

  Actually, it means
  beloved king.

                I'm no king.
                I'm no one.

          No.

  Everyone is someone.

    Why are you
    locked up?

            They never told me.

              They just feed me.

                And someone
               comes to wash me.

                      I used to
                    wash myself.

                I used to
                laugh and wash,

            but now they
           never bring me sweets
            after feeding me.

          After dinner could you
          bring me a sweet
          or anything? Please.

        Of course.

                Thank you.

            You won't let them
            kill you, will you?

          They'll try, you know?

            They like to
            kill nurses here.

          Why...

                  If I could,
                I would help you
                  fly away home.

                    But I can't.

      You won't forget my sweet.

            Means a lot to me.

          No.

      <i> PAUL: It's a</i>
      <i> fantastic opportunity</i>
      <i> for you, Susan.</i>

           <i> Dr. Magnus Quilly</i>
           <i> is a legend.</i>

    <i> Nothing makes any sense.</i>

    <i> I can't do this anymore.</i>

        <i> I want you to leave.</i>

          (KNOCKING AT DOOR)

  I'm sorry.
  We wanted to tell you
  about dinner tonight.

        Oh, my!

    Your lovely things.

        And your suit!

      Oh, my dear,
      why did you do it?

              I didn't do it.

            I didn't do it!

      The destruction of clothes
      is a desire to be naked.

          And what is naked?

              Naked is to be
              a fetus again.

        Always back to the womb,
          to go so far back
         as not even to be born.

  That's ridiculous.

      Surely, you are not
      saying you didn't
      do it yourself?

          That's exactly
          what I'm saying.

              Who... Why would
            anyone do that here?

  To force me to
  wear this uniform.

            Now, my dear,
            Miss Manning,
            try and think back.

    I did ask you if you
   objected to wearing a uniform
    and you said you didn't.

  That was before this.

        I repeat, it's the
        desire to be naked...

    Etcetera, etcetera,
    Dr. Preisser. I'm sure
    you've made your point.

        I insist!

      The clothes represent
      a deep hatred of self!

      This is insanity!

        That, I'm afraid, Nurse,
        is the business at hand.

        Dr. Moore, do you think
       that this act of violence

          and the suicide of
          Nurse Manning's friend
          had any connection?

      Dr. Paul Swanson is dead.

        He is not relevant!

          And he will not be
          given an autopsy.

      You, gentlemen,
      dishonor your profession.

        More than that,
        you exploit the ill.

              May I have my
              sweet now, please?

          (SIGHS)
          Oh, David.

    I forgot, I'm sorry.

    I was, uh... I was
    upset and selfish.

            Oh, all right,
            perhaps tomorrow.

        Thank you for
        understanding.

  You will have
  your sweet tomorrow.

    You stinking, rotten whore!

          You promised!
          At least the others...

            (SCREAMING)

        I killed you yesterday,
        and the day before,

        and the day before,
        and you're still alive!

              A sweet tomorrow
              will be just fine!

            I'll have something
            to look forward to!

              You are very kind!

              (GASPING)

  Please, don't beat me!
  I did nothing!

  She's my friend! Please!

      (GRUNTS)

          That will be all, Gow!
          You will not
          punish my people!

        (COUGHS)

                   I'll be back.

               Shut the fuck up!

            Stop it!
            You hear me? Stop!

            Gow, you shit!

            Now, we've
            discussed this,
            haven't we, David?

        You mustn't hurt people.

            (WHIMPERS)

              Do you understand?

      You could have killed her.

            (SOBBING)

            You're all right.
           You're gonna be fine.

      I'm not gonna
      be fine here.

              What on earth
            possessed you to get
            that close to David?

        Pity.

  Whatever possessed
  you to commit me?

            Therapy. And you
            committed yourself.

    You still don't believe
    I'm sane, do you?

          I believe that
          I can help.

        Dr. Moore,
        I am not insane.

        I came here to work.

      I'll make time for
      you tomorrow afternoon
      at 3:00.

          We can talk then.

          Rest. Now, you'll
          be all right.

                  It'll be fine.
                  Believe me.

                      (GASPS)
                      Hi!

  Do you want
  some company?

  Do you remember me?

                          Yes.

  You feel like
  you don't belong here.

                      I don't.

  That's the way
  everybody thought
  when they first came.

  But then you...
  You'll accept.

  You'll see.

  Would you like to cry?

          Then cry.

  I believe that crying in
  the presence of someone

  is more comforting
  than to cry alone.

  I cried for days
  when I first came here.

      And I cried alone.

      You're not alone.

      That's really nice of you.

          What's your name?

              Ronnie.

                Ronnie.

          We're gonna be
          great friends,
          aren't we?

                Mmm-hmm.

    I've got my planes. Oh!

  And I've got these.

  (CHUCKLES)

                  Where did
                  you get those?

          Nurse Parker
          gave them to me.

          Nurse Parker?
        That's who Ms. Donnymead
          keeps calling me.

       Do you know where she is?

  She's gone.
  She's never coming back.

        But we're gonna
        be great friends,
        aren't we?

        Ronnie, tell me
        more about the keys.

  They open everything.
  This one here,

  key to my heart.

  (LAUGHING)

              ISANDRA: I've just
              finished a poem.

                  My reading's
                  this evening,
                  you must come.

                The acclaim will
               be unprecedented.

  Were you always a poet?

      Always.
      Great poets are born.

        I didn't know that
        until I arrived here.

  Did Dr. Quilly
  explain that to you?

    Dr. Quilly is dead.

            Dr. Quilly is dead?

  Oh, yes. The man
  we now call Dr. Quilly
  explained it to me.

    Now, if Dr. Quilly is dead,
    who is the man that
    calls himself Dr. Quilly?

          Just a guest.

              A guest?

                One of us.

       Oh, when Dr. Quilly died,
        there was great unrest.

              We all felt
              so unprotected.

  So a guest became Dr. Quilly.

    Isandra, you sure you're
    not making this up?

      When did Dr. Quilly die?

              Yesterday.

      And when did you
      arrive at the Institute?

    Today or maybe tomorrow.

          Time is of no
          importance to a poet.

            I see.

          Um, I have to go.

        You won't forget
        my reading?

              No.

               Oh, Dr. Preisser.

          Yes?

            Oh, I'd like to
           apologize if I seemed

            rude to you
           last night at dinner.

  I appreciate that, Nurse.

  You see, in the Institute
  we all must be very, very
  kind to each other.

                    Doctor?

  Yes? Do you want
  to talk to me?

                    Yes.

  Then, please, sit down.

    I just really wanted to know
   if you knew Dr. Quilly before
    you came to the Institute?

          No. Why?

        Well, frankly,
        there's been some talk.

      I don't take it seriously.

        About Dr. Quilly,
        the real Dr. Quilly.

              He is...

        Well, he's, uh...

                  Dead?

    So you heard that?

        Oh. everyone has.

          You know,
          Isandra's fantasies
          are quite public here.

            She's been saying
            them for years.

          How long has
          she been here?

  She came here
  when she was a
  very, very young girl.

  Long before I did.

                Oh.

    Nurse Manning.

        Won't you sit down?

            Dr. Moore, you
            know how I feel
            about being here.

  You've been
  most articulate.

                   Well, it goes
                    beyond that.

            I've heard the
            most amazing things.

          For instance, the real
          Dr. Quilly is dead

              and Nurse Parker,
              she may have
              been murdered.

        And the other nurses,
       they've just disappeared.

            Dr. Moore,
            it seems to me
            that the Institute

            is far sicker
            than the patients.

  Innuendo. All you're really
  referring to is innuendo.

              Are you saying
              I've invented
              all of this?

        Let's find out.

    Let's try to put things
    in their proper perspective.

          Are you willing
          to help me try
          to understand?

            Yes, I am.

      All right, fine.
      Won't you sit down?

              All right.

              Now, let's try to
            put things in order.

            You're from Seattle?

              Yes.

                  And you came
                here as a nurse?

        Of course.

          And your Dr. Swanson,

            you say he was
            a psychotherapist.

          Yes, he was.

          And you believe
          he killed himself?

      I thought you said
      you were gonna help me.

          I thought you
          were different.

          I thought...
          That I was your
        knight in shining armor?

                No.

          I thought at least
          you were a doctor
          with some integrity.

          SUSAN: Ronnie,
          you've got to help me.

      Of course
      I'll help you.
      Now, watch.

        You must know
       how I can reach my family
       or anyone on the outside.

  Shh! Isandra's gonna
  read her poetry now.

              Ronnie, I don't
              want to cry alone.

  Look, I'll tell you what.

  Why don't you meet me
  tonight in Quilly's office
  at 3:00 a.m.?

  Everybody's asleep then.
  We can use Quilly's phone.

      You know how to
      get into Quilly's office?

      Of course.
      Remember these?

        (GIGGLES)

  Just be in Quilly's office
  tonight at 3:00
  and don't be late.

  I get sort of
  frightened when I'm
  in there all alone.

                Gentlemen.

  I have a special treat
  for you this evening.

  The first public reading
  of the Institute's own
  poetess in residence,

  the lovely Isandra Snow.

  DONNYMEAD: Bravo! Bravo!

        I shall make no speech.

          Oh, goody.
          How about no poetry?

      Gow, you can shut up
      or you can leave!

            And miss all this?

  My name is not Isandra.

      It's Cassandra.

            Or suiting yourself
            something else.

          Please, anything else.

  She's beautiful.

          (ALL LAUGHING)

            This is a terrible
            experience for her.

            Don't they know what
           they're doing to her?

  Psychotics are totally
  immersed in themselves

      or whoever they
      think they are.

    May this flame,
    this gentle flame,
    rise slowly...

            Cut the shit,
            Sandy baby, come on,
            take it off!

          (ALL LAUGHING)

        You all stop this now!

  You're a guest!
  If anything has to be stopped
  around here, I'll do it!

            You insist that
            I'm the nurse?

            The only nurse?
            Well, so be it.

         If your beloved doctors
        won't stop this, I will.

        Forget her, Sandy, baby.
          Go on, you're great!

          Mr. Gow, get out!

          And are you
          going to carry me out?

          No, but I will.

          You can all leave now.

      Now you've proven how
      strong and brave you are.

              We'll all listen
              to the nurse. Out!

  Jones, please take these
  people to their rooms.

              Are you all right?

  Oh, yes, but if
  you'll excuse me,

  I'll need my
  pills and some rest.
  I'm having this pain.

  Donnymead.
  Could you help
  Dr. Quilly, please?

           Isandra, it was fine,
            it was just fine.

            For God's sake.

        Why humiliate a nobody?

              SUSAN: Isandra,
            you're not a nobody.

          Don't dismiss
          yourself so easily.

            I was dismissed

          a long time ago.

            (SIGHS)

  DESMOND: I'm impressed.

              Very impressed.

              Thank you.

          (CLOCK CHIMES)

        (CRASHES)

            (GASPS)

  It's only me!

  (WHISPERS)
  Did you hear a noise?

          Yes, I tripped over
          Darlene's damned bike.

    What?
            No, no one
            else heard it.

            Calm down.

  Oh, I hope not.
  Would you like to...

                  Shh!

  (WHISPERS)
  Would you like to see
  my latest model?

  It's the first Spitfire
  that was ever made.

      Ronnie, we are here
      to help me. Remember?

                  We are?
            Yes.

              Oh, oh, we are.

            Then, we could go
            see the Spitfire?

            Of course.

              It's going to be
              my masterpiece.

        Ronnie, please try
        to concentrate.

              I get distracted.

            I know.

              Where were we?

        Quilly's phone.

          The phone, of course,
         uh, he keeps the phone,
          uh, in that drawer.

            Bingo!

        Oh, there's a
        phone in there.

        For heaven's sake,
        Ronnie, that's what
        we've been looking for.

                It is?
                  Yes.

              Oh, of course.
              Go ahead and
              make your call.

                I will.

            Tell your parents
            you found a friend.

            A savior.
          <i> WOMAN: Operator.</i>

      Hello? Hello?
      Hello, operator? Yes.

        I'd like you to
        place a collect call
        for me to...

      <i> Dear, you know</i>
      <i> only Dr. Quilly can place</i>
      <i> calls for his patients.</i>

    Well, I'm not a patient.

       <i> Well, what are the</i>
       <i> code words for today?</i>

      What are the code
      words for today?

          Um, wait,
          the code word...

     <i> You know you're a patient.</i>
      <i> Now, why don't you</i>
      <i> just go to sleep?</i>

    This is an emergency.

           <i> It always is.</i>
           <i> You are a patient.</i>

           <i> Now, just go</i>
           <i> back to sleep.</i>

        Hello? Hello?

          She hung up.

      Let's go see the Spitfire.

      No. Give me your keys.

            No. Uh-uh.
            Nurse Parker gave
            these to me. Uh-uh.

            Ronnie, this is
            very important.

    My papers are in
    one of those drawers.

  Now, if I can find them
  and show them to Desmond,
  he'll believe me.

                Desmond?

        Dr. Moore!

            Oh! Then we'll go
            see the Spitfire.

            Later.

        Give them to me.

            Well, you're
            my friend. Okay.

  Oh, the file's over there.

                How do you know?

      Well, because when
      I go to his session,

    Dr. Quilly always gets
    my file out of there.

                      Come on.

      These are patient's files.

            Wait, maybe
            I'm in here.
            The real me.

  Well, you are
  the real you.

          I know that,
          but I have to
          prove it somehow.

  These are all in code.
  Of course, they'd be in code.

            I don't know,
            we might find some
            pattern to this,

        but this way it doesn't
        make any sense.

          "M-O-T-H-P-R-O-F."

          Wait a minute,
          this is beginning
          to make sense.

          This could be
          Darlene Court's card.

          "C-Y-C." Cyclist.
          That means cyclist.

    Father's in business,
    mother perhaps a professor.

        "P-A-R-S-C-H-I-Z."

        Paranoid schizophrenic.

            "L-I-K-T-Y-S."

  I don't know
  what that is.

                "N-R-S."

              Could be nurse.

              Yeah.

                      "K-L."

        Could be kill.

            You don't think
            this is my card,
            do you?

              No.

  Ill. Could be ill.

                    It's kill!

      Ronnie!
          It's too late for
          dear old Ronnie.

          He's so scared of me
          he starts to shit
          every time he sees me.

          So, you've been having
        yourself a fine old time

              going through
              Dr. Quilly's desk.

          Had yourself a nice
          chat with the operator
          at Crownpoint, huh?

            (LAUGHING)
            Oh, rifling a desk.

              You are as bad
            as I am, young lady.
            We're both very bad.

  No! You come near
  and I'll scream!

                Scream, Scream.

  No! No! No! No! No!

          No! No!

      JONES: Gow! Nurse Manning!

          Go to your rooms!

          You fucking slime!

      I'm gonna slit
      your belly open
      like a flapping fish.

              (PANTING)

          Damn!

    Fucking pig!
            Wait a minute!

        I'll cut your
        goddamn throat!

        Dr. Moore.

  Last night
  before I found Isandra,

  I went to David's room
  and his door was unlocked,

  and he wasn't there.

      I saw David earlier
      this morning. He was in
      his room, peaceful, quiet.

      He wasn't in his
      room last night.

    Can we discuss this later?

      Jones, would you, uh,
    ask one of the staff members

    to bring out some candles
    and the fancy table cloths?

        We're gonna
        have a little service.
        She deserves a service.

            JONES:
           I'll take care of it.

       Hi. You've gotta help me.

    See, I came here as a nurse,
     I had credentials, but they
      took my credentials

                  and they say
                  I'm a patient,
                  but I'm not.

          Please, you've
          gotta help me.

      Uh, yeah, we understand.
      Listen, ma'am, why don't
      you talk to Dr. Quilly?

  He'll, uh... He'll give you
  all the help you need.
  Excuse me.

                      But...

        I've been watching you
        get out of hand, Nurse,

          and I've been
          patient long enough.

       There will be punishment,
        severe punishment!

        I'll handle this, Jones.

        But, Dr. Moore,
        the nurse has been
        breaking all our rules!

        How the hell am I
        supposed to keep
        order around here?

              You're doing a
            splendid job, Jones.

            Why don't you
            help the others in?
            Go ahead.

      JONES: All right,
      let's go. Back inside.

      Okay, everyone
      back inside. Let's go.

  SUSAN:
  Isandra told me
  a way to escape.

  Now, I know what
  she really meant.

  There's only one way
  to leave the Institute.

                  Henry seems to
                  do him better
                than the others.

      You know, I have to admit,
      my ego is slightly dented.

            Henry has literally
            never done me.

  Maybe that's because you're
  not the real Dr. Quilly.

                  Now, now,
                  you mustn't
                  mumble, Nurse.

                We can't hear
                what you say,
                we can't help.

    You didn't help Isandra,
    and you heard her.

        You made her speak
        loud and clear and
        everybody listened.

      You knew they would laugh.

  The theory worked.

  Isandra did
  become the poet

  and the poet
  was released
  from the Institute.

            Are you suggesting
            my responsibility
            for Isandra's death?

            Is that what you're
            saying, Dr. Moore?

            I demand an answer.

  Not here, Doctor.
  We have patients here.

      Jones, Ms. Donnymead,
    Lucille, see our guests out.

            This meal is over!

                You too, Nurse,
                may be excused.

          (BELL RINGING)

  How dare you
  question me in public?

              I asked you
            not to make a scene.

  Everything is a scene
  here at the Institute.

  It was designed that way.

  Desmond, suicide was
  Isandra's final fantasy.

  Her final freedom.

  Now, it's regretful,
  but it does happen.

  You didn't suppose that
  the Institute was the only
  mental hospital in the world

  that didn't have its
  percentage of failures?

    Adler failed.

        Jung failed.

      Freud failed!

        But they didn't
        accept failure as
        the ultimate therapy.

                Dr. Quilly,
               you know how long
               I've admired you.

                 We studied your
                books in school,

       we practically worshipped
        at your shrine.

            I came here to learn
              from a great man.

        I'm still trying to
        discover your theories.

          Your real theories.

     Those great books of yours.

  Theoretical books
  put into practice

  are not necessarily
  neat, Desmond.

  A book belongs on a shelf,
  you bring it to life,
  it's no longer a book.

          What is it, Doctor?

      The Institute!

                Doctor.

      (CLEARS THROAT)

            Are you all right?

          Yeah.

  SUSAN: Was it
  bad with Quilly?

                    Yes.

  Must be hard for you.

        Well, for me to have
        had the temerity even
        to question that man...

          Maybe he's
          not that man.

          Please, Susan, that's
          Isandra's story again.

    No, no, I'm not talking
    about Isandra's story.

        I'm just saying
        that people
        sometimes change

    and the Quilly
    that you respected so much
    may be a different one now.

      Some people have
      paid a terrible price
      for greatness.

          Like your Dr. Swanson?

          He could have
          been a great man.

    Susan, there are times
    when I am absolutely
    convinced you are sane.

              Then,

    as yesterday morning,
    that fantasy about
    David's disappearance...

        David was not there!

          All right, Susan,
          anything you say.

  Don't patronize me.

            I was, wasn't I?

        Yes.

          Please don't scream!
          I don't like screams!

              Besides,
              it wouldn't help!

  David, I just saw
  you in your room and
  the door was locked.

              No, it wasn't.

            I was out,
            but after I got
            back to my room

          no one ever came
         to lock the door again.

        No one knows
        that your door
        is unlocked?

            Only the one
            who let me out.

    That is such
    a hard mattress.

    You really should complain.

  David, who let you out?

                 Oh, it's always
                the same person.

          I only like it outside
          for a little while.

        I'm really quite
        comfortable in my room.

       Except when they wash me.

          I used to wash myself.

  You will again.

                    You promise?

            I promise.

              A person should
              wash his own body.

        I think I will.

          I was told to find you
          and kill you!

        But I couldn't kill you.

               Oh, what a lovely
                person you are.

              You remind me
              of someone who was
              very kind to me.

      Nurse Parker.

        She let me wash myself,
        before they killed her.

            They like to
            kill nurses here.
            And doctors, too.

              And they bury them

            in the cellar.

  David, please tell me
  who let you out
  of your room.

          May I have your brush?

                  I'm tired now.

  Do you wanna
  go to your room?

              If you'll take me.

        That was a lovely visit.

  David, where is
  this cellar?

                  Try the old...
          Shh!

              Try the old door
            next to the kitchen.
            Are you going there?

        Maybe.

        I'd invite you in,
        but it's not very tidy.

  That's all right.

          (TOY SQUEAKS)

          It's all in my mind.

                  Hello, Nurse.

          (SIGHS) Luther.

        You're not supposed
       to know about this place,
        neither am I.

      How did you find it?

        Gow showed it to me.
       He knew it would hurt me.

          Come. I have something
          to show you.

        This is Nurse
        Parker's grave.

          I worshipped her.
          She was so kind.

        She looked like you,
        you know.

  How do you know
  that's her grave?

        It's the newest.
        She was the last
        to be killed.

            The last one?

              Dr. Quilly was
              the first to die.

                  He's here.
                  The others
                  are outside.

                  That's the
                real Dr. Quilly?

          Oh, yes.
          The present Quilly
          is a patient.

      He took over
      when Quilly died
      to carry on his work.

       That's what Isandra said.

    Dr. Preisser said
    it was just her fantasy.

  Oh, Preisser's a patient, too.
  We're all patients here,

            except the dead.

      Only the dead are
      sane in the Institute,

          Dr. Moore doesn't know
          anything about this,

                  does he?

                  Does he?

                   LUTHER: Look!

  "Registered Nurse."
  They were nurses, too?

        They bring nurses
        here to the Institute

        so that one of the
        guests can kill them.

        But you don't know
       who's killing the nurses.

      No, I don't know.
      I know they get them here,

      they bring them here
      and they never leave.

          You'll sleep here
          one day, Nurse.

    The candles told me so.

          Oh, Lord God!

        Lord God, vengeance.

            Show thyself!

                    (GASPS)

    Dr. Quilly wants
    to see you now.

               Suppose I say no?

  Then you say no,
  but you will see
  Dr. Quilly now!

            Good! Because I want
              to see him now!

    Soft evening,
    eh, Nurse?

          Almost as if
          all elements conspired

                to quiet the
                beasts in man.

            (SIGHS)

    You are our most
    difficult guest, Nurse.

            Maybe that's because
              I'm not a guest.

    Intense shock therapy
    is the last resort
    of the Institute.

        You have brought me
        to that last resort.

  You were here in my office,
  you used the telephone.

  Oh, don't lie, the operator
  told me all about it.

  You have tried to
  destroy the Institute
  ever since you arrived.

  Then you used dear Ronnie
  to let you in here,

  you flaunted yourself
  in front of David, undoing
  a work of a whole year!

  But the final infamy
  was turning

  Desmond Moore
  from his work, my work!

              Your work?

        Turning a hospital,
        a place of healing
       into a parody of therapy?

        Yes, I was here
        and I used the phone.

      I was also in the cellar.

        You remember the cellar?
          You're buried there,
          so are the nurses.

    (SCREAMING)
    You were in the cellar?

            Yes, and in the
            basement room.

              The one that
              doesn't exist!

      (STAMMERS)
      That's a sacred place!

        No, it's the burial site
          for Dr. Quilly!

              The real one!

        How... How dare you?

          How dare you?

      And this whole damn place!

          This is you, isn't it?

        Paranoid schizophrenic,
        kills nurses.

        You tease and
        kill nurses, don't you?

              You're nothing
              but a patient!

      I am Magnus Quilly.

      This is my hospital.

            Mine!

            (ALARM RINGS)

            (CHOKES)

          (COUGHS)

  Magnus!

  Don't do anything, Doctor.

    I'll call an ambulance,
   we'll have you in Stockton...

  I'll be dead before the
  ambulance can get here.

  It'll be all right, Jones.

  Dr. Moore here
  will look after you.

        (PANTING)

                  Desmond,

          you'll have to
          take command.
          Good luck. Good luck.

            (CHOKING)
            You did this!

    You brought this all on!

            (GRUNTS)

          Is he dead?

          DESMOND: Susan? Susan?

              Are you all right?

                It's Dr. Moore.

          Dr. Quilly is alive.
          I just saw...

  Oh, I'm sorry
  if I startled you.

  It was just to
  honor Dr. Quilly.

            Quite an effective
            performance, Henry.

            Perhaps a bit
            too effective.
            Thank you, Henry.

        Sometimes we see
        things not as they are,

                 but as we would
                like them to be.

            As I mentioned
            to Dr. Paul Swanson
            this morning.

            You're saying you
            spoke with Paul?

        Yes, I called him
        this morning.

          It was sort of
          a hunch really.

        And you'll be
        happy to know
        he's very much alive.

                Alive?

    You weren't his nurse,
    Susan, you were his patient.

        You fell in love
        with him, it seems,

        and because
        of falling in
        love with Paul,

      he felt that
      another doctor should
      take over your treatment.

      The rejection was
      too much for you to bear.

      You imagined him dead
      and ran away

      here to the Institute.

    Maybe I should go back.

          No, of course not.

  The new head of the Institute
  needs a top notch nurse,
  doesn't he?

        I'll be moving
        into my new office.

      Maybe you'd like to help.

              Thank you.

        Needless to say
        the order and serenity

    that Dr. Quilly brought
    to the Institute

      will be one of the most
      important priorities
      during my tenure here.

    Ah, yes, Jones,
    set it right here, please.

  Of course, it'll be
  very important during
  this transition period

  that the rules
  of the Institute
  be strictly obeyed.

  Jones here has
  agreed to stay on
  as head of security

  and help us protect
  our way of life.

        (PEOPLE APPLAUDING)

        Thank you.
        Thank you all.

  Nurse Manning.

  Would you give me
  a hand here, please?

  Nothing like
  a touch of home
  in the office.

  Maybe you can help
  me arrange these.

          (TOY SQUEAKS)

      I saw a toy like this
      in the basement.

          It belonged
          to a patient.

        Paranoid, schizophrenic,
          chemist, teases...

          He teases.
          He likes toys.
          Kills nurses.

                  (SCREAMING)

        (ALARM RINGING)

  What happened here?

  There's been an accident.

  Jones, I want you to
  dispose of the body
  in the usual manner.

  Ronnie, I want you
  to clean this room up.

      Yes, Nurse Manning.

  Donnymead.

  Donnymead,
  I want you to call a
  staff meeting for later,

  and I expect everyone
  on the staff to attend.

                    But... Uh...

    Do you understand?

                Uh, yeah.

            Miss Manning.

            You must not forget
           you are just a nurse.

  I'm in charge now.

  The rest we can discuss
  later at the staff meeting.

      That's all.

  Jones, I want you
  to call the driver.

  The new doctor is
  due to arrive tonight

  and I'm gonna
  meet him personally.

            I don't think...

  No, you don't think!
  I'll do the thinking!

        Now, go.

        (CAR HORN HONKS)

                        Wait!

        You can't leave.

                  I'm late!

    You can't get out.

                    Why?

      You need this
      to open the gate.

            Thank you, Jones.

    DRIVER: Evening, ma'am.

        You see? I told you
        you'd get the job.

            Are you okay?

              I'm fine.
              Can we please go?

    The train station, ma'am?

            Police station.
