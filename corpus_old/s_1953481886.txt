His Majesty, the King.

<i>Previously..

It is settled.
We are to war with France.

Now,

I can go play.

Sir Thomas More.
Thomas.

Your Majesty.

You didn't say much
in counsel last night.

About what?
Going to war with France.

As a humanist, I have abhorrence of war.

As a king, I'm forced to disagree.

Now, there is someone I have to try.
A hundred crowns you don't succeed.

Done.

I'm ranking you Duke.
Duke of Suffolk.

How does that please Your Grace?
Celebrate!

He has no right to any of this.

I'm a direct descendant of Edward II.
This is my crown!

Hold Your Grace. Your Grace's arrested
on suspicion of treason.

I have no heir.
The Tudor Dynasty.

All my father's work finished,
and it's my fault!

Henry, will you not visit my
bedchamber, as you used to?

Things are not well between us.
His Majesty and I.

I think sometimes
he'll ask me for a divorce.

A divorce? That's impossible.

Is it?

His Majesty is tiring of your sister.

When she was his mistress,
all our fortunes were made.

They say that all his
liaisons are soon over.

He blows hot.
He blows cold.

Perhaps, you could imagine a
way to keep his interest more.

prolonged? to play his passions.

Who are you?
Anne Boleyn.

Mr. Wyatt, were you in
love with Anne Boleyn?

Of course I loved her, but
from a distance.

Never if you value your life, speak
of me to others, do you understand?

You must know that I desire
you with all my heart.

It is your duty to use
his love to our advantage.

No, not like this.
Seduce me.

I know what you're doing.

But do not think to take the King away.

When we're married,

I'll deliver you a son.

Everything within my power to give
you to you, it's yours, just ask.

I want a divorce,
and you will get one for me.

A divorce? I don't think that
English people would ever forgive him.

As far as I'm concerned,
our marriage has ended.

Soon he will see what you really are,

and he will tire of you.

And what if he does not?

If she gets her way,

she'll set our whole
country in her rule.

I have someone to
conclave of the cardinals,

to make a final judgment
on Your Majesty's annulment.

Make sure they come
to the right decision.

In this case, Eminence,

your reach has exceeded your grasp.

What if someone is
deliberately stalling?

Delaying things, making excuses.

You've gone cold on this divorce.

Perhaps, you've never
believed in the first place.

You lied to me, pretending
to be on my side.

Majesty!

If you are not for me now,
then you are against me.

Wolsey, sir, in the name of the King,

you're arrested by order of the King
and charged with high treason. / No!

You know, I don't wanna be chancellor.

You will do as I commend!

You think Mr. Cromwell is a great man?

No, I think he's a coming man.

As your Majesty well knows,
Kings are set above the law.

They're answerable to God
alone, who anointed them.

Thank you, Mr. Cromwell.

I shall denounce the Pope as a
heretic and marry whom I please.

If you want the world to know
that the King of England is

incapable of keeping his
word, then you have to.

I am merely Your Majesty's
humble servant.

I swear to you now,
everything will be different.

To hell!

I am the King of England!

If lion knows his own strength,

no man could control him.

London

Your Grace.
Lord Thomas.

Ambassador Chapuys.

I thought you had abandoned us.

It's true. I did,

or tried to.

In our conscience, I could
never abandon Her Majesty.

She's the most gracious and
wonderful woman in the world,

and the sadest.

I agree with you.

So does the Emperor.

He has written this
letter of an encouragement

and support,

for your efforts on her behalf.

I beg you not to deliver it to me.

Already I given more than sufficient
prove of my loyalty to the king...

I must have nothing to provoke suspicions.
Consider the times we live in.

I don't want to be deprived of the liberty,
which will allow me to speak boldly in private.

about this matters which concern
your master and the queen.

I understand.
You need to say no more.

Thank you, Mr. Cromwell.
Your Majesty.

Sir Thomas More.

Cromwell.

Sir Thomas.

Your Majesty.

I must tell you.

I've received a petition from the
members of the House of Commons

complaining of the cruel behavior
and abuses of the prelates

and the clergy.

Thomas..

people are asking for
freedom from clerical rule.

Your Majesty knows...

very well that I've always condamned the abuses of
the clergy. When they have been brought to light.

As your chancellor,

I have worked hard to eliminate
them and purify our Holy Church.

But..

You know where I stand.

You've always known.

I cannot condone this..

new fangled vision of private
belief and personal grace.

For me, the church is the permanent
and living sign of God's presence.

It is a visible, palpable community.

Not just a few breather and
gathered secret rooms.

Then, you'll speak against me.

My loyalty and love for
Your Majesty is so great

that I'll never say a
word against you in public.

So, help me, God.

Arise for the King!

Majesty.
Majesty.

My Lord, Your Graces

We are come here among
you to hear your response

to the charges and
responsibilities laid against you.

You're generally charged with supporting
the authority of the late Cardinal Wolsey,

and the Bishop of Rome, against
that of your own king and country.

Some here among you may suppose
I seek personal advantage.

It is not so.

As your king, I'm commission to
restore right order on Earth.

and assert the immunities
and princely liberties.

of our realm and crown.

This is my sacred duty.

Seal before God,

and by solemn oath at my coronation.

What is your conclusion,
Archbishop Warham?

Your Majesty,

before I deliver it, I give way to His Grace,
the Most Reverend Bishop Fisher,

The Bishop of Rochester.

My Lords,

we are asked to admit His Majesty

as Supreme Head of
the Church in England.

Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee this
to the king without abandoning

our unity with the sea of Rome.

If we are to renounce the
unity of the Christian world,

and leap out of Peter's ship,

then we shall be drown in the waves of
all heresies, sex, schisms and divisions.

I'm saying to you

that the acceptance of

legal supremacy over our Holy Church
would represent a tearing a thunder,

of the seamless coat of Christ.

Your Grace!

We'll hear your judgment.

I'll put this proposal to Congregation

that Your Majesty has a new title.

supreme head of the Church
and clergy of England,

but I had the caveat.

as far,

as the law of Christ alone,

Who is in favor?

Very well.

(in Latin)

whoever remained silent.

So, they're assumed to be agreed.

Thank you, Your Grace.

<i>Rome

Cardinal Campeggio!
Holy Father.

Sit down, Cardinal Campeggio.
I know you're hard to go.

And my feet are killing me too.

What'd you want to see me about?

We have received 2 new letters regarding
to King of England, the Great Matter.

Oh, not again.

What do they say?

Well, the first one's from the King himself, writing
cordial to make a final and favorable decision,

on his noun and for the
sake of peace in England.

He uses a salmon temperate
language of Holiness,

complaining that never there
was any prince handled by a Pope

"as Your Holiness has treated us."

He meant my predecessor and
frankly, he has the point.

Clemente was a terrible
procrastinator, indeed.

Although it was very wrong
for some people to dig up

the dead body and stabbed it in the street,
I can well understand that feelings.

He was never popular.

Requiescat in pace.
And the second letter?

From the Emperor on behalf of his aunt,

Catherine, the unhappy queen,
urging you to prevent interment,

and ex-communicate the King.

It is true, we must come to a judgment.

On the other hand,

to protect the interest of the Church,

we should try not to antagonize
one par above the other, after all,

they have soldiers and guns while as
we must make duel with beauty and truth.

What about this girl,
this putane, the King's whole?

Anne Boleyn.

Yes, why doesn't someone
just get rid of her?

No.

Don't get up.

Stay like that.

You're so very beautiful,

so very desirable.

I have to possess you completely.

I can't wait.

Oh, my love.

Just a little longer,

and then..

I've made the head of
the Church of England.

Is it true?

Then I'm so.. glad.

At last, you'll have your right,

and can do as your will.

I'm glad to have Cromwell refurbish
some of the apartments in the Tower.

Every Queen of England stays there

before the coronation.

Papa.

What's wrong?

Don't you want to celebrate?

It's far too early for that.

The bishops are not really defeated.

By default, they voted to make
the King head of the Church,

but only as far,
as the law of Christ allows.

You don't have to be a clever lawyer to know that the
lord of Christ may be used to invalidate the vot itself.

Then it was all for nothing.

No,

not for nothing.

The principle has now been
effectively conceded by most of them.

As George told me,

there're resistance and recalcitrance
really stand from only one man.

That bloody Bishop Fisher.
Fisher.

Sir?
Ah, Mr. Cranmer!

I'm so sorry to be late, Mr. Cranmer.

It's completely unforgivable.

Nonsense, we haven't even begun dining.
It's good to see you.

Mr. Boleyn
Mr. Wyatt, this is Mr. Cranmer.

Mr. Cranmer, you are a man
of the cloth, I believe.

And are you not a poet, Mr. Wyatt?
That's the least of my sense.

You may take one of my
confession after suffer.

I wouldn't if I were you.
It'll turn your head wired.

We were discussing before you arrived, the
progress of the Congregation of Bishops,

which was called to decide
upon the King's supremacy.

His majesty has wisely decided to appoint
George Boleyn here to negotiate with Their Graces.

I found most of them accommodating.

Of course, there're a
few stubborn exceptions.

Bishop Fisher, I assume.
True.

May I ask who else?

The archbishop himself.

Warren.

After years being perfectly pliable,

he suddenly become rather intransigent.

It's because he's old,

and consequently, he's closer to his maker,
to whom undue course he must explain himself?

Well, I'm sure that there'll be
a simple matter of him to explain

how he helped liberate his church from

superstition, religious false
of the ecclesiastical greed.

Mr. Rouss.

Yes, sir.

A cook

like trade.

Yes, sir.

You understand what we expect of you?

I do, yes.

This is for your trouble.

If you betray us,

I'll destroy your entire family.

Majesty, this is Mr. Cranmar,
whom I have often spoken.

to ask Mr. Cranmer who
first spoke the fact that

Your Majesty's great matter was
a theological issue and not legal one.

Mr. Cranmer.

I have desire to meet you almost
above any person now living.

You're most welcome here at court.

Majesty, I..
It's funny.

Some of the greatest and most
celebrated minds in my kingdom,

sweated and struggled over an issue which you,
an obcure caraf, if you forgive me,

was able to resolve with perfect
simplicity and a clarity of mind which..

put a mold of shame.

Majesty, I..

Um.. I..

Mr. Cranmer, His Majesty has decided
to appoint you his personal chaplain.

I.. ah..

You must thank His Majesty.

Majesty.

You are welcome here, Mr. Cranmer.

Mr. Cromwell.
Majesty.

Well done, Mr. Cranmer, well done.

So you married your wad?

What's her name?

Catherine Brook.

Catherine...

Why her?

I love and admire Miss Brooke.

Reminds me of my mother.

How old is she?

Seventeen.

Some mother.

Poor Catherine.

You're incapable of fidelity,
Charles, you always have them.

This time is different.

How different?

I don't know.

I just feel it.

And it is not because she's beautiful.

It is a marriage of two souls.

I'm sure you can understand that.

Oh, sun, go away.

Leave us to our own defiance.

I love you, Anne Boleyn.

I always will.

Always.

How could you say that, Thomas?

No unfortune brings what time changes.

Time won't change me,

or this.

Thomas.

My Lady Anne.

I'd like to congratulate
you for reaching so high.

Thank you, Thomas.

I sure never forget that
we were once true friends.

Oh, I wish I could forget.

But I see you are raised, too.

Well, it is a.. sometimes diplomat,
thanks to the patronage of Mr. Cromwell,

We person painters,sometimes
have our uses.

There is someone here
I sure you'd like to meet.

Lady Anne Boleyn, this is Mark Smithen,

dancing master, singer, musician,
and a general all round genius.

Mr. Smithen.

He likes to be called just plain Mark.

How could he possibly be called plain?

My lady, it's a great pleasure.

You play the violin?
Indeed.

Play me something.

Of course.

Will you share me?

I wanted to thank Your Grace
for your speech to congregation.

It was well said.

and very brave.
I spoke only truth.

I believe that the caveat,
so far is the law of Christ allows,

does indeed invalidated the whole bill.

How can the law of
Christ permit a lame on,

even a king, to be head of the Church?

Boy, a little for me.

I must ask you, Sir Thomas,

If you still have a mind
to resign your office..

After the vot, Your Grace,
I must confess I was solely tempted.

But on reflection,

I'm contempt to stand
fight for Christianity.

Oh, this is excellent news.

As indeed, is the turning
again of the archibishop.

I thank God that his conscience
has finally driven him to condemn

the King's solely suit.

And he has stated his intention to...

oppose the legislation,

which might be injurious to the Church.

Get a doctor.

Call a doctor, quick!

Help! Please help!

Oh, god, god..

Four men died of that pains.

Bishop Fisher survived then
because he ate a little of the soup.

It's very unfortunate, Sir Thomas.

It's more than
unfortunate, Your Majesty.

Fisher's cook has been arrested,

but I must tell you that..

that rumors abound us to the identity
of those who part of against him.

Who?

Wilchare's been named.

Boleyn?
Yes.

And...

well, some people even blame the Lady Anne.

Also people would blame her for everything!

They'll blame her if there're rains,
or if the rains fell.

They'll blame her for the baroness of the
queen, and for the fact that I love her.

They'll blame her for the
wind that destroys our crops,

and the storms that sink our ships.

It's all the fault of the Lady Anne.

What about you, Sir Thomas?

Do you blame her?

Do you think she'd try
to poison Bishop Fisher?

Henry..
All the time for "Henry" is over!

Whoever was to blame..

the cook, Rouss, tried

blatantly and almost successfully,
to poison one of Your Majesty's

great public servers, the bishop
of our Holy Church, as well as me.

Now, if Your Majesty would
turn up blind eye to a few things.

everyone would be forced to assume
that the attempted murders were

done with your blessing.

My lord, Boleyn.

Mr. Rouss, we can go over
and over this all day, so

one more time,

who gave you poison?

Mr. Rouss, it is inconceivable that you should suddenly
take upon yourself to murder your master and his household.

after serving him so diligently
these past four years.

Who gave you poison?

Sir, I have three daughters.

What does that mean?

I want them to find good husbands,

but that takes money.

We can pay you for your information.

No, sir.

Payment is already paid.

You can't set on it.

You're a fool,

and you will die for it.

You, hold a moment.

Where're you taking this linen?

To the Queen's Majesty.
Why?

To make shirts for His Majesty.
She always does that.

She still makes his shirts?

Yes. Yes, Miss Anne.

Sweetheart.
How could you?

What?
Your shirts!

She still makes your shirts!
How could you let her?

I haven't even thought about it.

You told me there was nothing
intimate between you anymore.

There isn't. What intimate.
They're just shirts for god's sake.

No, they're not just shirts.
They're you and me.

They're you and her!

I don't understand.
Then you want to.

It's so hard when we're to be
married, but she's still here!

You can't have three people in a marriage,
why can't you see that?

And why can't you understand that I have
more things to think about than my shirts!

The King has agreed to a new
and harsh treatment of prisoners.

They would be boiled alive.

He's wise to have dealt
so severe in this case.

But he cannot avoid some suspicions.

At least against the
lady and her father.

We're all in the hands of God.

But I worry about why
I lie here uselessly.

The King might proceed
with his divorce, since

he has given himself the power.

I was told that at the last counsel,
the King became angry.

and demanded to know what would
happen if he went ahead anyway

and marry to Anne without
Pope's permission?

That.. what did they say?
Only Boleyn supported him,

not even his friend, Brandon.

Thank god.

Catherine!

Husband.

How are you feeling?

What?

They told me you've been suffering from
toothache which I know is a terrible pain

and someone even said
you have a touch of gout.

Of course, I don't have gout.
I don't know why you even listen to such stupid rumors.

Because I care for you.

Catherine.

You're gonna have to
stop making my shirts.

I thought you liked the
shirts I made for you.

I see where you're wearing one.

Henry.
What now?

Our daughter Mary has..
has been not well.

She has not kept any food
on for eight days now.

Do you not think we should visit her?

You can go and visit
the princess if you like,

and you can stay there.

Even not for our daughter, not for anyone
would I dream of leaving you.

You know my rightful
place is by your side.

I can sign myself to God's mercy.

Bless you, sir.

Tell my girls I died easily,
and with no pain.

Head first?

Or wherever it comes?

Sit.

Your wife looks very beautiful,

seem very happy together.

Yes, we are.

Happy marriage is devoutely
something to be wished for.

To open the bridge,
I want you to do something for me.

Your Grace.

I need to speak to Your Majesty alone.

The King has sent you? at this hour, why?

The King wants you to be sensible.

withdraw your appeal to Rome, and
entrust your face with his hands.

And he promises to be more generous.

As you know, the parliament
is about to make him supreme

in the matter spiritual,
as well as temporal.

No.

Only the Pope has God's
power here on earth,

and is the image of eternal truth.

Yes, but the King..
Your Grace,

I love and have loved His Majesty
as much as any woman can love a man.

But I would not have wanted him
company as his wife, one moment

against the voice of my conscience.

I am his true wife.

Go to Rome if you want, and argue
it there with lots of important men,

instead of here,
it's just one poor woman.

What did she say?

She said that she'll obey
Your Majesty in everything.

Serve her obedience
to two higher powers.

Which two higher powers?

The Pope and the Emperor?

No.

God and her conscience.

Chapuys.

Majesty.

You can tell your master.
Actually, you can tell anyone you like.

I'll never agree to be judged
by the Pope in this matter,

and I don't care if Figavus
tries to excommunicate me.

He can do what he likes in Rome,
I'll do what I like here.

Majesty.

And by the way,

welcome back to court.

Majesty.

How was the Queen?

She was beautiful.

She's like a thing of the
other world once I got you.

I remember you once told me that..

you might sometimes
have to make me feel sad,

even if you didn't mean to.

Are you really going to make me sad?

No.

I swear to all that is holy.

All things will be in good.

And to you, I'll always be true,

never changing.

I wouldn't blame you
if you don't believe me.

Do you believe me?

Majesty.

You're sent for me?
Anne.

How should you like
to go hunting tomorrow?

If that is what Your Majesty desires.

We may be away for a while,

visit people,

stay with em.

Majesty, what is this all about?

And when we return,

we shall be alone.

Alone?

You and I,

here,

No other person.

Do you mean it?

I've already given instructions
for Catherine to leave.

Oh, my god.

Are you the most happyer?

Husband, what is this?

I saw it.
What?

What did you see?
After a long time...

I knew Lutheran tend
to haul a false prophet.

And so many signs..

I still don't understand.

What is it you've seen?

The Beast. The Antichrist.

He's near at hand, Alice.

You remember to pet him to drive?
Yes, Madam.

Beautiful morning for a ride.

Beautiful.

Be very careful with it, John,
on your own.

Let's go.

Move on.

My Lady, Mr. Secretary Cromwell
is here to see you.

Madam.

His Majesty commands that he'll be
gone from this place within a month

and settle at his house in More.

He did not even say good-bye.

You are free, of course, to take
with your attendance and servants.

Wherever I go,

I remain his wife,

and I'll pray for him.

There's ah.. another matter.

His Majesty wishes that you return to him
the official jewels of Queen of England.

No!

I'll not give up
with these rightfully mine

to adorn a woman who was
the scandal of Christianity.

Bless Your Majesty.

Your Majesty.

Your Majesty.

God bless Your Majesty.
God bless you.

Thank you.

God bless Your Majesty!
Thank all of you.

Blessing Lady.

Queen of Hearts.

There will be even crazier
crowds than this to welcome you..

when you return to London.

Yes? Come.

Well?

Majesty, I'm asked to pass on a
message of farewell from the Queen.

She regrets that you did
not wish her goodbye,

and she inquires after
Your Majesty's health.

The Queen! I do not
want any her goodbyes,

and I'm not wish to
offer her consolation!

I do not care whether she
ask after my health or not.

Let her stop this, and
mind our own business!

Do you understand me!
Yes, Your Majesty.

Get out!

I'm sorry.

Don't apologize.

How could things be different?

Indeed, everything is beautiful.

Don't you think?

Everything is beautiful?

Yes.

Everything is beautiful.

She's a witch,

who deserves all the fate
and to be dispatched to hell.

And who will you assassinate?
The Lady Anne?

Be the closer servant to the King.
I'm in a position to do so.

She seduced and bewitched him.

Consider his betraying his
lawful wife and the Holy Church.

We must not stay any longer,

but our prayers and hopes go with you.
