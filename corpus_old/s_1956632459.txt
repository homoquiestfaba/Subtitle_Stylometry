Put your hands on the wheel.

Give me a kiss.

(BELL RINGING)

COACH WISE: All right.
No lazy steps.

Let's go ahead and run it off.

I want constant
fluid movement today.

Is that understood?
WRESTLERS: Yes, coach!

COACH WISE:
And you better come

into every single match
with a plan,

because you better believe
if you don't have a plan,

your rival does.

(WHISTLE BLOWS)
All right!

Go ahead and pair up.

Find your battle buddies
right now.

I need you to leave
everything on the mat

and keep it
in the circle.

Remember,
you are future holders

of the great machine.
Let's go!

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

TEACHER: Every time
you walk out this door,

you look at that sign,

Carpe Diem. Seize the day.

There are no second chances.
There are no second acts.

There is no goddamn
motherfucking second place.

You better come in to every
single match with a plan.

Because if you don't
have a plan,

I can tell you right now,

your rival has a plan,

and it will manifest
itself in your defeat.

And you will lose.

Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. And up!

Over your heads.
Over your head. Hold it!

CHEERLEADERS:
...five, six, seven, eight.

One, two, three, four,

WRESTLERS:

I am a new machine.

I cannot be taken down,

I cannot be taken down,

<i>I cannot be taken down,</i>

<i>I am a new machine.</i>

(DOG BARKS)

I beat you home?
That's a first.

Yeah. Today was
a long one.

Long, but good?
Yeah.

Mmm. I know exactly
how you feel, babe.

You want some food?
Yeah.

I want what they're having.
(CHUCKLES)

It's high protein.
Yeah.

RONALD: How was school?
It was good.

You do realize there are more
words in the English language

you can use to speak
with your father, yeah?

School was good.
Uh-huh.

But practice went over

and I have
a history test tomorrow,

so I need to start homework.
Okay.

All right.
There you go.

I still need you
down here by 9:00.

I know.
All right.

(EXCITED CHATTER)


Come on. Okay now I'm gonna

let my hands down.
TYLER: No.

Come on.
No, I don't trust myself.

I don't trust myself.

I don't trust myself.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

(KNOCK AT DOOR)
RONALD: Hey, wake up.

Let's go!
Yeah, I'm up.

RONALD: Downstairs in five.
All right.

You ready?
Yeah.

Go.

MINISTER: <i>Love is patient.
Love is kind.</i>

Love is not rude.
It doesn't boast.

Love also forgets wrong.

If we spent more time
loving one another,

hate would cease.

So you have a choice.
Love works better.

Love is better for us.
It makes the world better,

but we have to be in action.
How much...

How do you want to love?
How can I love?

Well, you know what,
it could be just by a smile.

A smile on your face could...
A smile. Amen.

...change somebody's day.
CONGREGATION: Yes. Amen.


MINISTER: Now you choose

whether you use
the love correctly.

So I want to remind you
that love is

a four-letter word,
and so is hate.

We're in a world full
of hate right now.

Everybody's pointing a finger
at somebody else.

And you're no good.
And you're no good.

And we're no good.
And they're no good.

Ain't nobody good right now.

(CONGREGATION MURMURING)

So we need love
to bring people back.

There used to be an old thing
when I was growing up

that says it takes a village
to raise a child.

<i>It's gonna take
that same village</i>

<i>to bring us back to love
as a country.</i>

(SINGING ALONG WITH RADIO)

RONALD: You get in late
last night?

Not really.

Not really, huh?
You're just falling asleep

in church for no reason?
TYLER: No, I mean...

Were you bored with
that service today?

No, I mean, it's just...

How's your shoulder, Ty?
Still sore?

On and off.
I'm gonna call Steve.

Just get an appointment
to make sure.

No, it's fine.
He's fine.

You're one to talk.
I got my eye on it.

You had your eye
on your knee, too.

Look where that got you.
(SIGHS)

I'm sure he's fine, but we
have a whole season ahead.

And I'm sorry again
I'm gonna miss this one,

but your dad will be there,
and Em will be there,

and I'll be at the next one.
No, I can't be there either.

CATHERINE: What?

I told you.
Practice got moved.

It's your brother's
first meet.

EMILY: (STAMMERS)
I have to study.

Everybody else
can't meet that late.

And Bethany's mom says
that we can't...

CATHERINE: Oh,
that's what this is about.

Your friends at
Bethany's house.

Mom, he doesn't
even care if I'm there!

Very true.
Do you care if I'm there?

No, I don't care
if you're there.

CATHERINE: You do care.
And you should care.

EMILY: He doesn't.
Okay. All right.

There's nothing to worry
about here. And you know why?

Because the wise
and noble father

is gonna be there
to hold it down.


Really? Where is he?
Where is he?

If you see him, will you
send him my way, please?

(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

(CHUCKLES)
RONALD: Shame on you.

TYLER: If you see him,
send him my way too.

RONALD: We can go right now.
We can go?

Oh, we can go right now.
That's what's up?

RONALD: You think you can
take your old man?

TYLER: (LAUGHING) Hold on.

RONALD: You think
you can mess with this?

You guys.
What's up?

Can we not?
What's up?

RONALD: It's that shoulder,
right? Come on.

What's up?

RONALD: Did you start?
Did I start?

I'm just making sure
you started.

No.
Did you?

EMILY: (WHISPERS) Dad started.
TYLER: Get out my ear.

You let me know
when you're ready.

EMILY: Yeah, can you not
hit your sister?

(TYLER GRUNTING)

RONALD: You all right?
I'm fine, man.

RONALD: You let me know
when you're ready.

(GRUNTS)
You okay?

You let me know.
You let me know.

Can we not scare
the people, please?

RONALD: Shh. Quiet. Quiet.
Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

(GRUNTING)
RONALD: Come on!

One more.

Let's go.
One, one more.

One more?
One more.


I see you. I see you.
Come on.

What you... What you got?
What you got? Get in there.

(GROWLS SOFTLY)

(BREATHING DEEPLY)


(RONALD BREATHING HEAVILY)

TYLER: You good, brah?
I'm good.

Flex too hard?

(BOTH LAUGHING)
You flex too hard?

You got me. You got me.
This hurts.

<i>But it all starts
with a piece of dirt,</i>

and it turns into
something magnificent.

Something that makes

a contribution
to your community.

It's a beautiful thing.

You gotta take pride
in what you do, son.

(MACHINERY WHIRRING)
Never forget that.

Check this out.
Show you this master bedroom.

If you could be
so lucky one day

to have a bedroom
like this bedroom,

<i>then you'd be doing all right.</i>

<i>You'd be doing all right.
Check it out.</i>

(PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

BOBBY: You know spaghetti is
Alexis' favorite dish, right?

You should have seen
the first time that she had it.

We got it on video, okay?

We got to find it.
I got to find it for you.

Dad!
BOBBY: It's hilarious.

She ate it with her hands,
and it got everywhere.

I'm talking chunks
of meat and red sauce,

just all over the place
like a wild animal.

Dad, shut up!
ELENA: So cute!

So cute.
(TYLER LAUGHS)

BOBBY: It was adorable.
It was the most lovely thing.

Oh, my God.

It's beautiful.
It was beautiful.

ELENA: Plus, you were so cute.

(PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES)

What?

COACH WISE:
<i>Now in the eye of your mind,</i>

<i>in your mind's eye,</i>

I want you to fixate
on your source code,

on your soul's source of pure
unadulterated inspiration.

Something that is inspiring
to you and you alone.

I want you to look at it.
I want you to take it in.

I want it to be your guiding
light right now, all right?

And then I want you to
repeat after me...

I will not let you down.
Repeat.

WRESTLERS: I will not
let you down.

COACH WISE: You will not
let me down. Repeat.

WRESTLERS:
You will not let me down.

COACH WISE: My folks
won't let me down.

WRESTLERS:
My folks won't let me down.

COACH WISE:
My coach won't let me down.

WRESTLERS:
My coach won't let me down.

I cannot be taken down.
I am a new machine. Say it!

WRESTLERS:
I cannot be taken down.

I am a new machine.

COACH WISE: One more time!

WRESTLERS: (LOUDLY)
I cannot be taken down.

I am a new machine.

One more time with me!

ALL: I cannot be taken down.
I am a new machine.

One more time!

ALL: I cannot be taken down.
I am a new machine.

COACH WISE: All right,
Mavericks on three.

One, two, three.

WRESTLERS: Mavericks!
Mavericks!

(BUZZER SOUNDS)
CROWD: (CHANTING) Mavericks!

Mavericks! Mavericks!

(BLOWS WHISTLE)

(CROWD CHEERING)

REFEREE: One, two, three!

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

(CROWD CHEERING)

RONALD: You see it?
Yep.

You see it?
You feel the difference?

Yeah, I feel the difference
all right.

Can you get up?
All right. Yeah.

All right. If you did it
the way I taught you,

you would have had him
20 seconds earlier, all right?

Get up.

(TYLER GRUNTS)

The kid was
a chump, man.

You may have been
able to pin him quick

because you're faster
and you're stronger,

but your technique...

Getting to State
is about technique.

You feel me? You good?
Yeah. I'm good.

Your shoulder's good?
It's not hurting?

No.
You sure?

I'm sure.
All right. Come on.

Let me see that fireman
one more time.

Come on. Come on.

EMILY: What?

TYLER: Em!
EMILY: What?

Emily!

Hurry up, man.
Shut up.

Michael J. Fox looking nigga.

Come on, brah.
(CAT MEOWS)

Close my door.
EMILY: Close your own door.

Yo, yo, yo.
And there... Hello.

How was your day?
It was fine.

Could've been better,
but it's cool...

I got a suit fitted.

For the Maverick Ball?
Yep.

You're gonna look good.
Oh, your sister's going.

What group is she going with?
You think I would know?

She just better not be going with my
ass, all right?

You are your sister's keeper.
(SCOFFS) Since when?

It's not like it's your prom.
(SIGHS)

Is Alexis excited?

Yeah, I hope so. She's had
her dress for long enough.

(CATHERINE CHUCKLES)

How was your day?
Exhausting.

Oh, that divorce
is happening.

I have some notes
for you to do.

RONALD: I keep telling her
if she'd spread her schedule out

and worked Fridays,
she wouldn't be so exhausted.

My patients have me
until Thursday.

Come Friday I want to
be with my babies.

RONALD: Kiss?

There's my girl.

Good day?

Yeah. Not bad.
(CLEARS THROAT)

You done with your homework?
Not yet.

RONALD: What you
waiting for?

I just came down
to say hi to Mom.

It's a two-second break.

Oh.
CATHERINE: How's your knee?

The usual.

Go make your bath.
Yes, ma'am.

Hey, you didn't take any
of my pain pills, did you?

CATHERINE: No. Why?
RONALD: It's all good.

DR. STEVE: <i>SLAP stands for</i>

<i>Superior Labrum
Anterior and Posterior.</i>

This top area here
is where the biceps tendon

attaches to the labrum.

That's why
you are also feeling pain

running up your arm.

Now, in your case,

if you don't remember
a specific event,

then you could have
aggravated your shoulder

and then over time,

with repetition,
made it worse and worse.

Since it's the labrum,

it's not just
overhead activities.

Any strenuous activity
on the biceps tendon

will enhance it, as well.

TYLER: Okay, um... I'm sorry.
So, like, what...

What does that mean?

Well, you've done
extreme damage.

You have a level five
out of five SLAP tear.

I've never actually seen
this level tear in person.

Well, I mean,
it's not that bad.

I could easily
push through it.

I'm afraid you need surgery
or you're running the risk of

permanent, irreversible,
damage.

But I'm...
But I'm in season right now, so...

I understand. But Tyler,
this is very serious.

I highly recommend you stop

all physical activity
immediately

and we get you surgery
as soon as possible.

Wait, what if...
What if we did it, um...

What if we did it
at the end of season

and I could, you know,

I could recover
over the summer?

And I could be ready
for next year for college?

I can't see you
making another match,

let alone
an entire season.

Then, to be honest,
recovery would take much longer

than just the summer.

You're likely never to fully
recover to the way you were,

but the sooner we address
this, the better.

and you'll heal very well.

It's going
to take time.

<i>I can call your mom if you...</i>

TYLER: <i>No,
you don't have to do that.</i>

<i>I'll... I'll talk to her.</i>

DR. STEVE:
<i>I'm very sorry, Tyler.</i>

WALLY:
That's one bottle of vodka.

There you go.

You got it, bud?
Yeah.

Tyler?

COACH WISE:
Geez. Every practice.



TYLER: (WHISPERS)
Don't be a pussy.

COACH WISE: Let him up!
(GRUNTS)

RONALD: <i>What's the matter, Ty?</i>

Let's do this.
I'm right here with you. Come on.

Go.



Three.

Eight. Two more.

One more, baby. (GRUNTS)

How you doing?
(WEIGHT PLATE CLATTERS)

You done now?
Yeah, I'm good.

That's it?
I'm done.


CATHERINE: (ON RECORDING)
<i>...broke down in tears today,</i>

<i>and Linda continues to refuse
any type of communication.</i>

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

RONALD: How's it coming?
Good.

How many more you got?
Halfway.

What's this format?
Why's the date over there?

It's the format
she told me to do.

Can you just let me
do my thing?

I don't pay you
to do your thing.

I pay you to do my thing.

Technically she pays me.
You know, there you go again.

What's that attitude about?
What do you mean?

You know exactly what I mean.
Hey, stop!

Turn it off and look at me.

(BEEPS)
(RECORDING TURNS OFF)

Look around here for a sec.

Who do you think
keeps all this running, hmm?

Now, your mother may be
great with the patients,

but she don't know nothing
about running a business.

You think if I quit my job

and stopped running
your mother's business,

that you'd have a place
to even

lay that big head
of yours? Huh?

No.
Then what's up?

I mean, I just have a lot
going on right now.

Do you really? What,
you think me and your mom

don't got a lot going on?

Wait until you get out
on your own in the world

and have
real responsibilities.

You got to be able
to balance it, Ty.

Now, we talked
about this, brah.

If you can't keep it going,
you can forget about

hanging out with your friends
or running around

with that little
girl of yours. You...

Quit shaking your head
at me, boy.

This is my house.
If you don't like the way

I run things,
then you can be up out.

I told you you didn't
have to work for me

and you didn't
have to train with me.

You asked for that.
That was your choice, right?

And I'm not the one
who chose wrestling,

but if you're gonna
do something,

you might as well
do it right.

I said it before,
I'll say it again.

The world don't give a shit
about you or me.

We are not afforded
the luxury of being average.

Got to work 10 times as hard
just to get anywhere.

It's... (SIGHS)

Ty, I don't push you
because I want to.

I push you because
I have to.

Do you hear
what I'm saying, son?

Do you hear what I'm saying?
Yeah. Yeah.

Good.

Good.

Man, I look at y'all
sometimes and think of

all the opportunities
you have that I didn't.

Wishing Nana and
Three Papa had done for me.

You don't know
how good you got it.

CATHERINE: Watch your voice.
Steve should've told us.

RONALD: So much
for a scholarship.

I don't know what
the hell he was thinking.

CATHERINE: Steve said
he didn't call

because Tyler wanted
to tell us personally.

RONALD: So he's been lying
to us this whole time?

It's his attitude,
I'm telling you. The boy...

(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

I missed you.
I missed you, too.

Your callouses are
getting better, at least.

Yeah, that's because
I haven't been lifting.

Oh, right. Shit. Sorry.

I'm not really in the mood
right now.

Why not? I mean, it's...

Baby, it's been forever.
I mean...


I know you're under
a lot of pressure right now,

but I'm just getting
really scared.

About what? What's going on?
Are you okay?

I still haven't gotten
my period.

What?

It's been like two,
three weeks.

I don't know. I'm just...

I have nobody
to talk to about it

and I'm just getting
really scared.

Don't be...
Don't be scared.

First of all, you can
always talk to me.

All right?
Look, you can always talk to me.

We're in this together.
(SNIFFLES)

I don't want you
to ever feel like

you should be scared
or anything like that.

Look at me. Babe, look at me.

Everything's going
to be okay, all right?

All right?

Yeah.

Come here.

I love you too.

I think this is it.

Yeah?

ALEXIS: Fucking assholes.
Just don't look at them.

ALEXIS: Why do they
have to do that?

TYLER: Do what?

You want me to
drop you off here?

ALEXIS: Drop me off?
I mean, where do you...

What else
do you want me to do?

GUARD: All right, let me have
everybody's attention.

All right.

Look, these people
out here are crazy, man.

And these women, they carry
guns on them. I seen it.

All right, I also seen them
try to convince

a young woman not to
go through the procedure,

because they promised her
to adopt her child.

And guess what?
They didn't.

Didn't help her out at all.

And guess what?
She's stuck.

They tell people
the worst things

every single day
and I got to take it.

But listen, I'm here
for y'all, all right?

But all I ask in return

is that you're here
for me as well.

So please,

do not go out here and mess
with these crazy women.

Okay? All right.

WOMAN: Thanks.
GUARD: Thank you.

(DOOR OPENS)

Can we go? Just...
Can we please leave?

TYLER: Yeah.

You all right?

play this stuff all the time.

Really?
Mmm-hmm.

Oh.

My grandpa used to
stay up all night

and listen to records,

sometimes dance
with my grandma.

(CUTLERY CLATTERS)

Well, that...
That's cool.

Yeah. Yeah.
They're gone now, though.

Oh, I'm sorry.

No, it's okay.
That sucks.

I still see my other
grandma all the time.

Yeah?

Do you talk
to your grandparents?

Um, yeah, on my mom's side.
Oh, not on your dad's side?

No, I don't know anybody
on my dad's side really.

Do you want to, um...

Do you want to split a burger?

Um...

I'm eating burgers at
breakfast, lunch and dinner

since the season ended.

Right. You're in wrestling?

Yes, I am.
How did you know that?

Well, I may have
Insta-stalked you

after the lip sync final.
Really? Oh, nice!

And maybe Twitter.

I'm not...
I'm actually...

I actually am not gonna lie,
I did the same thing to you,

but I couldn't find anything.

Yeah, I deleted everything.
Why?

Um...

I don't know.
Why do you think?

I don't know.
That's why I asked.

Um... You know

who my brother is, right?
Yes.

Well, people would just, uh...
(CLEARS THROAT)

Just send me really horrible
messages all the time.

Oh, fuck.
(EXHALES)


I'm sorry.

You know,
people can be such assholes.

Fuck 'em.

Fuck 'em.

Fuck 'em.

Fuck 'em good.

That's a manatee.
I fucking love manatees.

They're like if a cow

You know what they're
more like is, uh,

like, they move so slow
like a sloth.

Yeah, kind of. Yeah.
You know?

We should go see them.

We should go, like,

Have you ever been?

Do you know the springs?
Um, no.

We should go. Do you want...

Yeah, but how

this started before, okay?

It's just gotten worse.
CATHERINE: Unbelievable.

RONALD: What?
What's unbelievable?

Will you say something to me?
Tell me. What is it? What?

What's unbelievable?
Catherine, please.

I'm right here.
I'm all ears. What is it?

CATHERINE: I'm sorry I don't
want to fuck you right now.

Okay?

We are in crisis here.
Remember?

Mmm-hmm.

It's so much.
There's so much to push through.

We shouldn't have to
think about that.

It's not just about
the sex, Catherine.

You're not here.
Like, you're not here.

You're not.
It's not a family anymore.

I...


We still have other things
to think about. All right?

We still have a daughter.
We still have a daughter?

Where are you?

What do...
What have you done for her?

What's that supposed to mean?
What are you doing for her?

What are you talking about?
You have... (LAUGHS)

You're not there for her.
You were never there for her.

Even before.
What? No.

You show up,

you play Mr. Nice Guy, and
you leave all the work for me.

Is that what
you want me to do?

What in the hell
are you talking about?

You want me to go take care
of her again for you?

What are you talking about?

You pushed him!


You pushed him!

That's not...

You were not there for her.

It was different with Tyler,
and you know that.

You know that I raised...
You don't listen.

...these kids
the best way that I know.

You're not listening to me.
You don't listen to anyone!

Well, at least I'm here,
Catherine!

I'm the one that's trying to
hold this family together.

Where are you?

There's a little black boy
going out into this world...

I'm grieving!

I'm just asking you, can I
grieve in my way, please?

Yeah. That's not fair.

I've done nothing
but be here for you.

That's all I've done.
I'm just trying to be a good...

I can't be around you. God.

Oh, God, you make me sick.

Wait... I make you sick?

What did I do
to make you sick?

Like, honestly,
I just want to be here for you, with you.

We're going through

She's the fucking greatest.

She drives me crazy,

What about your dad?

My dad?
Mmm-hmm.

Um...

He's not the best dude.

Do you want to talk about it?

Um, sure, yeah. Uh...

Well, when I was a kid,
he was just drunk

and on drugs a lot and, um...

Just did some pretty terrible
stuff to me and my mom.

I mean, especially my mom.

And I couldn't do
anything about it,

because I was just a kid.

But, yeah, eventually
my mom cut us off.


And you haven't
talked to him at all since?

No. No,
he actually has cancer.

Really?
Yeah, he has cancer.

I'm sorry.
No, it's all right.

He's a piece of shit.
He deserves it.

So... He's not in my life.
I don't know him.

I really wish I could
talk to my mom.

You don't talk to her?
No, she's dead.

Really? Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

No, it's fine.
It's okay. Um...

My stepmom is really my mom.

I mean, she's the one
who raised us, so...

Yeah, I haven't seen
my biological mom

since I was, like,
a little girl.

Oh, no. Um...
How'd she die?

She overdosed.

Really?
Mmm-hmm.

I'm so sorry.
It's fine.

I'm sorry too.

It's been hard.

Hasn't it?


Don't know how to connect

She won't look at me.

She won't talk to me.

I think she hates me.
I really do.

Dad, she doesn't hate you.
No, she might.

She's just shutting down,
you know?

She won't go to work.

Couldn't even if
she wanted to.

The business will not recover.
We're just losing money.

Just...

I just love her so much

but I'm losing her,
and I don't know what to do.

I'm sorry.

Dad, don't apologize.

I shouldn't be telling you all this.

No, it's okay.

It's just... (SNIFFLES)

I don't have anyone else

I know. It's okay. Dad.

Look, I'm really happy
you're telling me this stuff.

I promise, okay?
Okay.

Thank you. (SIGHS)

You know,
I could've stopped it.

Stopped what?
What do you mean?

Well... (CLEARS THROAT)

I was there that night and...

I saw him following her.
And I...

I had that sick feeling
in my stomach.

Um...

I don't know what happened.
I kind of just froze.

Baby.

It's just so crazy,

'cause if I just
would've gotten up...

You know?
No. No.

If I just would've
gotten up, then...

I would've went up to him
and stopped him,

and she would still be here.
Wait. Listen to me.

This is not your fault.
So I just... Yeah, it is.

No, it's not.
It is.

Because I was there.
No, and you can't blame yourself for it.

I could've done something...
You understand me?

...and I just didn't.
You didn't do this.

Your brother did it.
It's not...

I chose not to do anything.

Sweetheart, you didn't do it.
This is not...

And I don't know
why I did that.

This is not your fault.

It is.

I hate him so much!

What he did is evil, Dad!
He's evil.

He's a... He's a monster!
I understand that...

He's a monster for
doing that to her! I don't...

I understand
that you're angry.

How does somebody do that?
You have every right to be.

Do you hear me?
But your brother?

He's not a monster.
He's not evil.

He's just a human being.

I know the pain that
you're feeling right now.

Believe me, I know it.

I think about your brother
every day

I could've done differently.

But we can't change it,
you know?

All we have is now.

All we have is now.

And I'm telling you this
because I love you.

Holding on to that much
hate will destroy a person,

and I'm not about to let
that happen to you.

You have so much love
to share with the world.

And so much life yet to live.

Hey, you remember
Papa's favorite scriptures?

It said,
