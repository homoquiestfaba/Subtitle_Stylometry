Juan de la Cruz!

I'm a friend of your cousin, Felipe.

Are you Juan?

Can we talk?

Sure. But not here.

I'm done in about four hours.

You need to leave now. They're coming.

Do you own anything?

No.

Can you read or write?

Well... No.

Of course not.

Who in your family works?

Me and my wife.

And my kids. The older ones anyways.

The other ones are still too young.

Do you want more for your kids?

Of course.

But...

Most of the people are afraid.

They have to feed their kids.

It's not easy doing it alone.

I'll return in one month
to help you start organizing.

But I need you to gather
everyone you can here.

Ok, that's fine.

And you won't be alone anymore.

What is happening here in Delano

is the same thing that is happening
in Salinas or in Stockton.

If we don't get organized,
the bosses are going to treat us like...

Excuse me.

Who are you?

My daughter has some questionnaires.

We want to know what concerns you.

Come on, just do that for us.

Come on. There's nothing to see here.

Nobody leave!

Stay together, stay strong!

Our brother Cesar Chavez
will speak to us now.

Brothers and sisters.

Today our fellow Filipino workers
have taken a vital step

towards the fight for freedom and dignity

that poverty has denied us.

And they have come to us
and asked a very important question.

Whether we're prepared to set
our differences apart and join their strike.

But the most important thing to consider

is if news of this strike remains only in
Delano, then we will have been defeated.

Because they not only own the land,
but also the police and judges.

If we show the world
their abuse, greed, and brutality

then our voice will be heard
and responded to.

And when they see that our actions are just

they will understand that our cause is just.

Then we will prevail.
Yes we can!

Strike! I

Long live the strike!

Long live the farmworker!

Long live our cause!

Long live our farmworker movement!

Keep marching. Keep marching, please.

Strike!

Strike!

Strike!

Everyone gather up.

Who's thirsty?

Here, have some cold water.

It's free...

I've been told that some union members

affiliated with the communist party

have been talking with you.

Making promises.
These promises are nothing but lies.

You could even end up in jail.

And for what?

What's wrong, Cruz?

Aren't you thirsty?

If any of you has a problem,
tell me about it.

We don't want any problems here.

We're here to help.

Don't be afraid.

United we will stand.

They will not defeat us.

United we will stand.

They will not defeat us.

This movement is for you, the people.

They will not defeat us.

Long live the strike!

Long live Cesar Chavez!

Son! Son!

They're not paying you enough!
Come join us!

Join the cause!

Son, they're not paying you enough.

Don't betray your people.

Hey, come join us!

Come!

Don't be afraid!

If we leave at 10 p.m.,
we can catch them in Modesto.

Yeah, I know Dad.

We're going to see your dad
and from there we can go home.

I don't want to see my Dad.

He'll be happy to see you!

He won't even know I'm there.

I am glad you came.

I am glad you came.

Donations.

Boots.

In colors, in colors,

are the little birds that come from outside.

In colors, in colors,

is the rainbow that we see shining.

And that is why I love

The great loves of many colors

It's time for his nap, Sir.

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Dear brothers and sisters.

As we prepare to celebrate
the mystery of Christ's love,

let us acknowledge our sins.

I confess to almighty God

and to you, my brothers and sisters,
that I have sinned through my own fault

in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and have failed to do.

Through my fault, through my fault
through my most grievous fault.

Hi.
Hi Cruz, how're you doing?

I brought my cousins to sign the pledge,
they just crossed the border.

Well done, have them sign.

Look.

I brought Cesar some food.

Please tell him to eat something
and stop being stubborn.

And he took bread in his hands

blessed it

and gave it to his disciples and said

"Take this all of you, and eat it"

"this is my body
which will be given up for you."

The body of Christ.
Amen.

Everyone, stop working for a minute.

Come, join the strike.
Cesar Chavez wants to defend you!

Slow down!

Slow down! Slow down!

Call an ambulance!
Juan!Juan!

Help! Help!

Yes, we can!
