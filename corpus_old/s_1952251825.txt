 I wanted really good to my mother 

 She was drug addict 

 alcoholic 

 had become almost blind 

 was schizophrenic 

 But I never forgot that I loved 

 although even if you did 

 continuously, 

 continuously ... 

 continuously. 

 Give me the money! 

 Are mine! 

 Are mine, the state from them to me! 

 If you do not like us do not eat! 

 Do not touch me, touch me not! 

 Where are they, eh? 
 Where are they? 

 Leave me! 

 Damele now! 
 Give me, I said! 

 I have them given to you, 
 you have taken. 

 I ve data 100 

 When I arrived the check 
 I gave $ 100 to any one of you. 

 to keep them from, 
 you understand? 

 Those we serve to live! 

 Time enough, 
 every month the same fucking story 

 If you take them you shoot them in the vein 
 and we die of hunger! 

 They are my ... 

 Well I do not I have taken. 

 You are a liar 

 Give me now, 
 you my stuff! 

 Dangerous! 

 Dangerous! 
 We are hungry! 

 Leave me! 
 Those we need to eat! 

 How you did it to have, eh? 
 You've given their lives. 

 Do you want me to go on the streets 
 a prostituitmi 
 E 'that eh? 

 And 'why do you want? 
 You know, I make the robe ... 

 I need ... 

 I need 

 I need 

 A Medina? 

 It 'true, and you get to $ 15,200 
 at the end of the round of double jeopardy. 

 I wanted to see that smile, 

 Oh God, how I wanted it ... 

 I was pathetic ... 

 All'Acquedotto not go! 

 Mom! 

 Dad ... 

 Is going all'Acquedotto. 
 Accidentals What difference does it make ... 

 Robbery! 
 Who cares! 

 Help her father, does not see,

 It 'always the same old story ... 

 Seen, they repaired the lampposts 

 The robbers break them again 

 No, quiet 

 You see, your mother is sure, 
 the water goes down ... 

 There is no water 

 You are wrong, 
 you do not know what the aqueduct? 

 The aqueduct brought water to New York City 
 Well, for over 100 years 

 Then they closed but now open 

 and there is water just below 
 what drags your mother. 

 My father, you could sit on the couch 
 and speak with him for hours 

 But you could not speak at length 

 Hey Jane! 

 He knew many things, 
 always had the correct answers 
 to quiz jeopardy. 

 He knew all the answers 

 Hey, watch where you are going! 

 This is the way 

 Parents are of your 

 I see them as an example of what 
 that I found my long life 

 tended so little to my needs 

 and I feel that their needs 
 was so strong 

 that I was neither angry nor suffering 
 that is not me interessasero 

 In short, I said: 
 must be the human condition that has become so 

 Then came reality 

 I have taken the husband 
 Elisabeth I kill you! 

 No, Mom! 

 Did I understand you a favor, you are 
 only a sick slut! 

 Help me clean Liz, see if 
 this casino take away all of us! 

 No, noo! 
 Outside my house! 

 Do not stories! 

 I do not come with you, 
 you understand? Noo, noo! 

 The window is broken 

 I threw out the cat 

 Let me stay, let me stay! 

 Why not try to take your medicine? 

 No, take 

 Just get a little 
 Okay 

 E 'un vero schifo! 
 What have you done here? 

 He took a knife! 

 I fell! 

 Careful hoo hoo! 

 Where's the phone? 
 Non ce l'abbiamo. 

 This story must be solved 
 and now 

 You two have only one alternative: 
 give a cleaner to this post 
 and help your mother! 

 Tell our father! 

 No no, you are a feminist. 

 I can go away or send via your parents. 

 Continue to skip school 
 and here is a house that looks like a pigsty! 

 Where to go, come here, go back! 

 Go to school, you have idea how is done? 

 There are girls who beat you and that 
 you steal everything you have! 

 You can not have anything of yours! 

 We do clean the bathrooms, 
 does not work there if you do it here! 

 What happened? 

 Been back, been back! 

 There's nothing to watch 

 Mom! 

 mom 

 mom 

 But I do not notice 

 and yet everyone could view it 
 who suffered so much ... 

 His efforts were so visible 
 but no one dreamed of understanding 

 It's not that if you rub it 
 or not that was a good mother 

 was that now she no longer had anything to lose 

 Fammi winds with you! 

 Here's the task, I hope you've finished. 

 Well, take your places! 

 Hey that stinks! 

 But what ... 

 I was always the one that stinks in the classroom 

 Lisa has many benefits 
 But Dad said that was supposed to marry 
 a doctor if he had so many expectations 

 on the contrary I did not have any expectations, so ... 

 I scratched for lice, 
 between the legs also mi prude 

 My teachers always told me 
 not to get excited 

 My laundry ... 

 I did not know what to do with the linen 

 the bore until it is torn 

 Forza ragazzi, come back to place, 
 the interval is over. 

 I had bad teeth, 

 I was hungry ... 

 The teachers are treating her not to touch me 

 And 'as if those words falling on the floor 

 Give me the test, it is unnecessary for you to do. 
 No, I want to do it. 

 But if you're almost never came to class! 

 I want to do it ... 
 does not seem difficult 

 OK ... 

 Liz, wait 

 Do you have a bad odor, Liz, 
 not your mother tells you to .. 

 No, no ... 
 it is my fault because I forgot 

 Well, tonight when you do shower 
 remember to wash behind here 

 I have put aside a few things 

 Here ... 

 And this, but how did you do? 

 We've never in school 

 I read a lot 

 really, and what? 

 Well Encyclopedia 

 The lady of the upstairs, Eva, 
 it was found in a box 

 is almost complete, in short ... 
 R apart from the S 

 if the test there were questions between the R and S 
 I have the wrong 

 Oh Liz, you have to come to school 
 OK 
 say seriously 

 you are too intelligent not to be here 

 I do not understand why we come. 
 There will come. 

 How did a tell you that the school made me sad? 

 I did not know how to speak, 
 I did not know how to talk to anyone. 

 My house was not a place where you can grow up 
 and be normal. 

 If too many absences will have to call the social worker 

 and is not a threat, 
 is a promise. 

 Eva, look what I got, 
 thanks to your encyclopedia! 

 Brava, you must always take votes bei! 
 Un'idiota not want to be ... 

 and keep hard, give me right 
 now that your mother is back 

 My mother has returned? 

 Ah, we passed a couple of quiet months, 
 is not it? 

 The good thing that my mother had been 
 in hospital was that when he returned was 
 my mother again 

 Cooked, slept, he began to study 
 shorthand for the company in a 
 while he was out of the community. 

 But then, the drugs appear ... 

 Mom .. 

 mom 

 Lizzy 

 Are you OK? 
 Yes, I'm good. 

 Sparrows, 
 just six beautiful, you know? 

 I am happy that you are here 

 .. and you are happy? 

 Well, see the hospital ... 

 was not all that bad. 

 No, it's not true, 
 the walls were high and also 
 the bars on the windows 

 I'm sorry, you know, you had to view it 

 Are accustomed 

 But now you are here 

 Look, 
 you see I took Mom 100 

 Ma. no .. 
 100 is a good vote, 100 is the highest. 

 Do not you ever taken, Mom? 

 No 

 I am not going to school 

 I ran that I was too young. 
 Do not ever run away from home, you understand? 

 No, I will not 

 I ... I will always here with you 

 I know, Mom 

 I will always be there ... remember 

 Sure, Mom 

 I am sick ...

 I have AIDS ... 

 No. .. no ... 

 No, no no ... You do not need to be afraid 

 They say that we must not be afraid 
 because I could say that well be able 
 to survive, you understand? 

 but not here ... 

 I have to go home .. 
 you're already home! 

 No, at home by my father, 
 and Lisa take you with me 

 No, no, you have to stay here 

 I have to stop drugs,

 But he will only 

 Liz, your sister has already left,

 I do not want, 
 you have you said that you beat your father, 
 who had raped your sister 

 Now this is what I do 

 No, stay here 

 I can not ... 

 remains mum .. 

 Everything was in pieces 

 I thought that if I had stayed 
 I have stopped the destruction 

 or at least I would be able 
 to not make things worse. 

 Want to open the door? 

 E 'inutile, I know you're at home. 

 Your mother and your sister? 

 Left 

 and your father? 

 went to take food, 
 back immediately. 

 We called the school, continues to do away ... 

 never go there .. 
 We must do something, you understand? 

 Wanda has warned, I have warned you, 
 all the social workers have done 

 We have said to you in all ways 

 Please clean this place 
 and go to school, 
 clean and go to school, 

 but you have not done neither one nor the other ... 
 o sbaglio? 

 No 

 What do you mean? 

 I do not know 

 But I will 

 Go into an institution, 
 Come away with me 

 No! But things are better now, 
 dad buys me food all day 

 She does not pay the rent, 
 and not send to school 

 I tell him to go, 
 I said to you, is not it Liz? 

 but you think with your head, 
 is a silly feminist 

 Are not things that joke, 
 to prepare your suitcase ... 
 now! 

 No, no! 
 I swear I'll go to school, please! 

 Sorry, we need an adult 
 who is responsible 

 My grandfather was in charge! 
 I take my grandfather! 
 My sister was already by him 

 But Lisa goes to school there. 
 We'll go too! 
 I shall promise, please! 

 Not piagnucolare 

 Talk to your grandfather 
 and if you take him 
 will be out in 24 hours 

 Here's the bag 

 and if he does not? 

 You will have time to think about how to live life 

 Think about how to live life ... 

 how many people really do? 

 We think while sinking? 

 Intercom, and you put 

 it was like to visit my mother 

 Only now I was here in hospital 

 Now do you see! 

 Andiamo! 

 Not 24 hours after I left, 
 and even after 24 days, 
 nobody wanted me. 

 I just left them and 

 Why not go to school? 

 And 'This is the main problem, 
 why do not we go? 

 For me 
 your is a problem of discipline 

 Hello Liz! 
 Hello grandfather 

 You call your mother 
 Hey! Come out, came 

 Are late, 
 but first I wanted to see you 

 Thanks Lisa 

 Not all messed up, 
 we are well e. .. 

 you do not expect much, is dying 

 Lizzy! 

 Mom 

 Sparrows 

 When I think of my life, 
 this is the moment that I like to remember 

 when I went back into the life of my mother 
 was lucid 

 Do not take drugs anymore and so the drugs 
 schizophrenia were for effect 

 We went to the corner bar, 
 sedevamo us to speak 

 and ate hamburgher, 
 in short, we were together 

 even if he had weak eyes 
 I think we could see 

 ie could see my side dishes, 

 and for a while I had my mother again 

 I remember, 
 slide down the hill 

 the working board 
 as if it were a sled 

 We still remember? 
 Yes 

 And when you did the tickle 
 Of course I remember, 
 I do not remember precisely 

 Yeah, I was a good mother, 
 is not so? 

 Sure Mom, you were good 

 Right 

 You know, I am pleased that we are all together now 
 volio tell me, you and Lisa 

 Would not it be nice if Dad 
 stop to take drugs? 

 Maybe we could go back to University Avenue 

 Here, well the fact is that now your father 
 is at a shelter for homeless 

 I fear that we have 
 lost the apartment 

 I mean, he never paid the rent, 
 and so, you know ... 

 What happened to my stuff? 

 Been thrown 

 What? 
 Even my encyclopedia? 

 Feel sparrows, I am sorry to die, but 
 they put seals on doors and windows 

 In short, there was nothing we could do, 
 is that you know, bad luck is something that  happens 
 I want to say ... 

 Listen, I had almost dimanticata that I have to go 
 go around the corner to greet friends 

 We put only a minute okay? 
 You finschii Meanwhile the hamburger 

 I, I .. torno subito, 
 just stay away, promised 

 only a minute 

 It was just so, 
 no more return 

 I was not able to maintain anything, 
 I was only worsened things 

 at least if I were going to school ... 

 if only I had, 
 if only I had ... 

 and so that part of my life was over 

 had begun a new hope ... 

 Elisabeth Murray 
 She is the mother? 
 Yes Like 

 Ah, now I accompany you in your class 
 Thanks 

 A moment 

 Hello Mom 
 Hello

 and then we must do our best 

 My mother was dying, 
 my father he had gone 

 but I believe that I had my way 
 I would have met 

 I was 15 years, I was doing .. 

 What is a house after all, 
 a roof, a bed 

 A place where if you did you 
 you do not take away 

 If so, then I had 15 years 
 when I became a homeless 

 You have a coin? 
 Go to work 

 Me something? 

 Bought food 

 You have some change left? 

 Sometimes I had the impression 
 that he never had a house 

 Roll the dice 

 Andiamo 

 Hey, stop! 

 At other times I knew 
 that was my mother anywhere 
 that was my house 

 Oddio .. 

 but over the months she disappeared 

 Liz ...

 But where end? 

 Here I was with friends 

 I have six non - 

 Well grandpa has beaten me and I .. 

 I could not stay here 

 but sure ... 

 your sister told me that you 
 stopped going to school 

 is true, but we will come back 

 and when?

 all make fun of me 

 Liz thinks I make fun of 
 those of the bar, why tremble 

 and I can not stop shaking 

 I think it is the fault of too much alcohol, Mom 

 you should stop 

 Ok, ok .. 

 can you heal .. 

 I love you 

 mom 

 I love you 

 is resumed with pictures 

 dai, hurry! 

 I arrive first! 
 You are wrong, look 

 Boys expect, 
 we are after ok? 
 Vado a moment a.. 

 Hello 

 mom 

 We made a collection 

 she no longer believes it 
 that you take all the fun 

 is dead ... 
 died yesterday morning 

 Sometimes I feel that there is 
 a kind of skin beneath 

 I wish that those who are born in us 
 can look through 

 but can not pass through 

 My mother was buried in 51 
 lot of the poor 

 My mother was inside them, 
 the strangers had put the 
 in the enclosure 

 was naked, scared ... 
 no, had died just 

 Hurry, let's go 
 No, a moment 

 What is the function, 
 there should be a priest, 
 is not that you use? 

 When one dies, the buried, 
 everything here 

 E 'una donna ... 

 And it is my mother 

 There is the priest? 
 Not in these cases, do not you know? 

 Ah so is dead, 
 put underground 

 Priest or a priest, that mattered, 
 if you had gone, and perhaps had 
 already begun to rot 

 I'm sorry 

 and I had to believe that he had found 
 Peace 

 Come with us? 

 Why do not you leave? 

 Hey, wait 

 Ok .. 

 So I leave here 

 Listen, the fact is that I can not 
 I .. non ce la faccio più ... 
 and then I leave here 

 Where? 

 In an institution 

 In a mental hospital .. 

 You know Lizzy, this is here, 
 this is the lunatic asylum! 

 Come with me 

 Ok, see you around 

 People died, 
 things are mixed up 

 everything that is apparently so solid 
 becomes devoid of meaning 

 there remain only 
 gestures we do 

 gestures in the air, 
 this is what remains 

 I remember racing to my mother 
 in the crowd, 

 I felt the warmth of his arms around me, 
 when I was little, 
 when she was good 

 but it was so long ago, 

 maybe it happened once 

 I was betrayed perhaps a hundred times 
 but it does not matter, 
 I have never been good at keeping accounts 

 them we choose our memories 

 Sign out of them! 

 Where do you put the tombstone? 

 No plaque, no space 

 Time a week 
 and there would have been more 
 track her 

 but that mattered, 
 that was not the reality, 
 the reality is only in our hearts 

 She lived in my heart, 
 but I am not living anywhere, 
 I was alone in the world 

 You have 16 years and the third media 

 and you are a prisoner of a spiral 
 all sinks in worst place 
 you have ever dreamed 

 There is nothing inside of you, 
 you've exhausted every possible 
 to be accepted 

 and all those who believe in you 
 you set them repinti 

 Eva? 

 I do not want to be an idiot, 
 I want to go to school 

 Yes 
 Hello, I am Liz Murray, 
 I have an appointment 

 at 9 and a half, 
 10 are the 

 Sorry, the Underground was .. 
 sorry to me, but now it's too late 

 The school started 2 weeks ago 
 and we have only boys that 
 come on time, dear 

 The brochure says: broad participation 
 Student Development 
 of a community calendar 

 I just need a chance 

 You can wait to talk to Daniel, 
 but a meeting immediately after 

 I understood at that moment that I had to make a choice: 

 I could surrender to what happened 
 creandomi living a life of excuses 

 or I could make an effort, 
 I could make an effort 
 and make my life better 

 We'll let you know Friday. 
 Ok, thanks 
 E 'stato un piacere 

 Elisabeth 
 Liz 

 Liz I am sorry, but those 
 were the last admissions 

 Oh, yes, but I can speak for a moment, 30 seconds? 

 You should make a request, 
 there is a questionnaire 

 E.. here I have already made 
 Give me a chance ... 

 There are no adults ever been 
 able to give me confidence, to feel 
 and then to give me an education .. 

 In short, I do not know how to talk to you, here is 
 still 

 My parents were, takes drugs, 
 I do not want to like them, 
 is as though I had lived their lives 

 Today is different, I feel confused 
 and I do not understand many things 

 including why 
 refused school 
 and I stop at the third media 

 What I see though your 
 results were good 

 I did see the last week 
 in time for exams, 
 that's how I was brought 

 So who are intelligent, I can do it, 
 .., I just need a chance 

 a chance to emerge 
 the world they were born, do you understand? 

 Those who live are so empty, tired, 
 and are left to survive 

 But I know that there is an outside world that .. 
 which is better, you see? 

 E. more developed. 
 And is what I want to live 

 Why only now? 

 My mother died of AIDS a couple of months ago 
 and for me was ... 

 beh ecco .. 
 a bad day 

 I always thought it would be healed 
 and it would be taken care of me .. 

 Bella nonsense .. 

 You have not dealt with me, 
 I worked for her .. 

 was my baby 

 hours if they have gone .. 
 and so I ... 

 It 'time for you take care 
 of yourself

 Why, this is not a normal school? 

 Well, it is public, but it is as if it were private 
 Already

 Those of 

 No, no,

 Many words of other people

 Why only one point of view 
 shows us a world-dimensional 

 Correct answer, here is the prize! 

 Bismarck, Marx, the guy who sold me 
 the tires that you do as a reward

 but I want the other 
 side by your side 

 You are very smart 
 Yes, you too 

 I see that I have put a A 
 Yes, it was a very good job 

 How come you have given me this vote? 
 Liz, if you have given to you is because you are deserved 

 This is your first task in the classroom 
 All Time eh? 

 If my job goes A 
 I want you to me the reasons 

 Okay 
 so ... 

 Oh! 
 What are you doing still here? 

 Algebra 
 Well, I am past the 11, I have to close 

 Sorry, but those who follow courses? 

 Ah, the regulatory cycles, 
 then the program on Saturday, 
 the evening course in French 

 and the laboratory sciences 
 after a 
 10 ... 

 Now you understand why I have to look 
 at this algebra? 

 It 'great! 
 I have 17 years, 
 I do not want to get to 21 without having finished high school 

 What would you do, 
 5 years in excess of 3? 

 In 2 ... 
 you should revise the mathematics 

 Yeah, but so is dying! 

 No. .. 
 that is to live 

 I knew the time, the line B 
 put us 70 minutes to do the whole race 

 back and forth 4 times 
 and I would be arrived at school just 
 a little in advance 

 Daniel and I would 
 be done 

 For the first time my life 
 had a place to which to refer 

 Chris? 

 Chris, that joy! 
 What surprise 

 What are you doing here? 

 I go out 
 You are not at school 
 I have skipped 

 Why not have you tried? 
 I did 

 I have sought for so long 
 just that ... Well, it's hard here 
 is the sound of this place, you understand? 

 Now I am free 
 and I go to a new school, 
 I see you 

 Hey ... 
 quiet 
 courage, it's all right, let us 

 The last to leave 
 and the first to arrive? 

 Well always arrive after you, Daniel 
 are you the king of punctuality 

 Well, it took me years to learn, 
 at school I was always late 

 Who are you, anyway? 
 My friend Chris, 
 my best friend 

 Chris hello 
 Hello 

 I want us to be you 
 Watch which is not a nightclub, 
 is a serious 

 se va bene a te, 
 will do to you too 

 What do you get in bacheca 
 We decided to send our 10 
 best students on a trip to Boston 

 Cool! 
 We've never been? 
 I've never been out of New York 

 Once we were in Queens 
 Well, there you go 

 Stop it, 
 I do not believe to be among the best 
 10 students 

 You're right, 
 you're not among the best, 
 you're the best ... 

 You had the votes 
 highest of the whole school 

 and so will you .. Boston 
 Fully charged 

 As 
 5 days 

 Va tutto bene? 
 Yes 

 It 's just that I am always 
 been a void ... 

 You are not a nullity 

 The tour serves to make you 
 think of the college 

 And as a college 
 It's not stuff for us, losing leaves 

 You could come too .. 
 Can? 

 Of course, if you be to do 
 But to me I could not care 
 a damn! 

 And from Chris 
 Be realistic, 
 what do you want to be great? 

 Why, 
 they do not seem 
 big enough? 

 Chris ... 
 I wanted to say after the above, 
 is Ok Liz 

 No, it is not Ok, 
 I am a Barbona, a prostitta 

 And then who cares if 
 what I will be 

 E 'fantastico 
 Welcome to Harvard 

 So, it's like you imagine it? 

 Better, definitely better 

 Liz, are just people 

 Yes, but are not like me 

 Why were not like me? 
 What is that made them so different? 

 The place where they were born? 

 Io ce la stave putting all 
 by not having to live as a 
 Barbona prostitute or worse 

 What if .. and if I had worked more? 

 Now I was so close to the skin of the world 
 that I could touch 

 It will be hard to get here, 
 but it is not impossible 

 Since there are other scholarships? 
 Yes, perhaps some 

 Write about 1500 words 
 the free market in the world 
 and will win $ 500 

 Well, I neservirebbero only 70 
 all years 

 Ah, there was an interesting article 
 on the New York Times, 
 ce maybe I still here 

 Here it is 

 $ 12,000 
 Each year for 4 years! 
 What should I do? 

 Include a short subject that describes 
 what do you think is the most 
 significant academic achievement 

 and how did you manage to overcome 
 the pitfalls and obstacles 

 I do a copy? 

 I want to stand beside the people 
 and not on the sidewalk for this 
 feel lower than their 

 I'd like to go to Harvard, 
 have a good education 
 e able to read all the books better 

 Then I think: 
 and if I were crazy? 

 If you work every crumb 
 my potential to succeed? 

 I have to do, 
 I have no choice 

 Are late? 
 No, it's me in advance 

 I made you coffee 
 sweetener, right? 
 Right! 

 Thanks 

 Can I have a stamp for this? 

 E 'for a scholarship 
 New York Times! 
 Not yet you have sent? 

 When the term expires? 
 Tomorrow 

 Io te l'ho on 4 months ago, Liz! 
 What do you expect? 

 To arrive at today, 
 and then to take 18 years 

 E 'il tuo compleanno? 

 Happy birthday! 

 I do not believe there was 
 an age limit 

 I know, thanks 

 Now I could tell the truth, 
 that I was a homeless 
 and no one could come and take me away 

 Lisa 

 Liz! 

 Yes 

 What are you doing here? 

 Will I be interviewed 
 I am a finalist for a scholarship 
 New York Times 

 But, here I am ... 
 I have nothing to put me 

 Would you like my clothes? 

 Well, nothing showy, just 
 ecco ... something to put 
 on this 

 Thank you 

 Once Mom 
 revenge my clothes ... 
 I could not go to school 

 I remember 

 How cried, 
 so I liked going to school 

 But there you've never gone 

 why give you a scholarship? 

 Why are homeless 
 I am going very well at school 

 You are not a homeless, Liz, 
 you could live here 

 I could not, 
 and you know ... 

 Grandfather's fault, eh? 

 I'm becoming blind 

 as the mother 

 and I have so much fear 

 Liz! 

 Liz, I was thrown out by 
 with all my stuff 

 They can not if you have not 
 yet 18 years 

 Were either Brooklin, 
 I do not want to go to Brooklin! 
 You must help me! 

 I have an interview 

 No! Liz! 
 I gotta go! 

 You can not leave 
 your friend 

 Chris! 

 Lasiami do this interview, 
 and then you can come to school with me 

 I do not care! 
 Not center anything with this place, 
 and even you 

 Yes. 
 I was 

 Do you believe that people like us 
 can come to Harvard? 

 The world turns, 
 and you are not a dot, 
 everything goes on without you 

 situations do not favor 
 what you want 

 The needs of others and their 
 emergencies will always be 
 your strongest 

 I believe that people become frustrated 
 by the harshness of life 

 So spend time immersed 
 in those frustrations they 
 call anger 

 So continue to keep 
 eyes closed 
 situations as a whole 

 and all those little things 
 who contributed 
 to make it as 

 Since my parents small 
 I have never given much right, 
 and this has allowed me 

 to realize that 
 the little things that one day 
 would be my person 

 For this I have never asked 
 why things went 
 in one way or another 

 I understand .. 

 You can not say that I was happy, 
 in fact this made me very sad, 

 but I was aware 

 but accept the 

 because basically I have always known 
 that day 
 ce l'avrei fatta 

 Is there anything else you want to tell us? 

 I loved my mother, 

 most of my life 

 She was a drugged, 
 was un'alcolista 

 had become almost blind 
 and was also schizophrenic 

 But .. 

 I never forget 
 that .. I loved you 

 even if you did, 

 continuously, 

 continuously, 

 continuously ... 

 This scholarship 
 for me is very important 

 because I would not 
 go to college without it 

 Had an average of 
 95 out of 150 across the winning class 

 He obtained and completed 
 5 years in excess of 2 

 and there is successful while 
 a homeless 

 Having lost his mother early 
 and with the father toxic employee 

 but it is more just that I talk you 

 then you present the winner 
 the sixth edition of 
 the scholarship of the New York Times 

 Liz Murray 

 Now everything has changed, 

 my life will never be the same e.. 

 and I do not know what else to say except thanks 
 thank you very much 

 Liz! 
 Liz, how did you succeed? 

 How could I not do it .. 
 my parents showed me 
 the alternative 

 Do not try displeasure 
 for your child? 

 Displeasure? 

 Sleeping in the subway, 
 gather food from bins 
 garbage 

 Well no, 
 that was always 
 my life 

 I think .. I think I have been lucky 
 because they are deprived 
 any sense of security 

 and was this a spur 
 and force them to look ahead 

 I had to do it, 
 there was no alternative 

 so I arrived at the point where 
 I thought: OK, 

 working hard, I give you to do 
 the straits of forces 
 e.. we see 

 Now I am about to go 
 to college, e. .. 

 and the New York Times 
 if they bear the costs 

 So you were lucky ... but 
 there is something that changes 
 if I could do it? 

 Yes 

 back 

 ever 

 while to get my family 

 Dento are still at college, 

 I found a job at the New York Times, 

 I found an apartment 

 no longer have to pull back their lives 

 no longer have to pull back their lives 

 but I do ... 

 All those I know, 
 what I did 

 fragments splashing away, 
 I forget the little things 

 but it's so hard to pull ahead 

 alone 

 that's why I told you so, 

 Why do I mention 
 my story 

 and now put down the burden, 
 put ashore 

 and I will go ahead 

 Ciao, Mom
