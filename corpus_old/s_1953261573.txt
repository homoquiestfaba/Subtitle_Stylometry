From what I see, you owe me.

He turned his back on his family.

I wonder who he is?

Hello, Hena!
Hi!

Hi! Jared!

Not me, surely someone else.
Oh.

Nice to meet you!

It seems so long ago.

Look at you!

No one will ever hurt you?

I want you to remember this.

She did not hurt anyone.

I made the choice.

I would think differently.

-What are you doing?
We'll split up.

They do not know anything about you.

You're just a distraction.

I do not like this plan.

I did not ask if you liked it.

We should not divide us.

Listen!

Follow this road. and will be cut to
the road.

Use your charm, a passage and continue north.

We can still get in Canada.

But until then!

I do not recognize myself.

I'm not your brother.

Not until I tell you, it's safe.

Remember how I taught you.

I leave you now, and I will
call you tonight, okay.

You're a modern girl, be careful.

I'm not a child.

Come on, get out of here!

So, tell me something
on you, Addisons.

What do you know?

I do not know ... What you do for a living?
Why are you so serious? Anything.

I was a boxer.

Sometimes, as a long time ago.

Like a boxer in the ring boxer?

ì, my? father trained me since I was a ragazzin

I've been training since I was little.

Oh, you must be really good.

I won a silver medal.

Is not it?
Oh, shit ...

You have on you?
I do not usually ... I happened to be today.

Can I?

This is really cool.
It is not gold, but ...

It 's amazing.

I've never been good at anything.

Here we go ... Are you going to help me.
Keep your child.

This guy needs you. Is that okay?

We can not do this without you.

Here we go.

Liza, you can help your mother and the baby.

Accompany them, go to
in a blanket and accompany them.

Cuddle up real tight.
I had to do something.

Now, Liza, I tried to imagine
how you feel.

I think it will ...
complicated feelings.

I think at this moment nothing in
the whole world seems secure.

Step dad is gone.

Your mother is ill.

And you were in the woods with a stranger.

What happened to your hand?

Well, I got in a fight ...

With the great Indian chief.

He cut my finger.

Did you kill him?
Yes, I did.

Are you going to kill me?

No.

You're still a child.
children should be protected.

The angels protect me.

Maybe this is how you should think of me.

I was an angel
got out of the storm.

And remove this man from your life.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Why would you do this trip alone?

What is your excuse?

I do not know.

I just wanted to think for a moment, you know ...

I can take it.

I hate to be alone,
I'm scared ... it always has.

Do you still want to ...
do it?

I hope you're the one.

I hope that no one else is coming.

I hope no one else.

Pretend ... okay?

I pretend to ...

Fuck me Addison.

So you want to be when you grew up?

Nurse, I wanted to be a nurse.

I always wanted to be a farmer.

We have a farm food, mostly peaches.

But my father was an alcoholic.
And I run into the ground.

When I was a child I
always want to fix it up.

The farmer right.

Can I change the baby?

Yes.

Make a great nurse.

I had a baby sitter ...

When we were kids I used to
take care of her, just as you are.

Where is he now?

I would like that is out there somewhere.

I see you're going
leave her alone.

(PEOPLE TALK)

It 'my daughter Ammy, you know?
Of course his friends from school, please.

Then you know that it is always
afraid of him for a lifetime.

It 's probably because I've never ...
Madam, tell me what happened?

He did not come home last night.

He must come to my house.

She and her son, her husband Bobby
is a bad guy.

The men who do not know him?

We met at his house
on several occasions.

Have you ever divorce him yesterday?

Are you trying to call?
No,

Bobby in a hunting cabin with no phone
and all that was in the forest.

Could you please check?

Be sure, please let me
all is well.

Let me feel like a stupid old woman.

Sure.

I'll be home pretty late.

It is not necessary waiting.

Hey.
Yes?

You're a little 'silent this morning, are you okay?

Yes.

Parents know it is not easy for anyone.

You have done it this way.
Well, because they are more
hide hardest part.

And you're always grateful.

Who knew you were hungry.

I think you said your beam residence.
I'd like to take in case of need.

All right, then.

I would like to keep warm.

Do not tell me what to do.

Began to seem obvious.

Where are you?

Are you still alive?

I can hear when you're dead
there was nothing else I think.

I just felt the need to keep moving.

Now listen,

everything has become so confused.

The man you are talking about,

turned really sucks.

He just disappeared from me.

Thus,

I'll find 'another way.

And I'll call you.

O you who call me, where are you?

Okay, hello.

Participate?

Of course.
All right.

Hey!

Hey guys what's the problem?
You beat!

Go away!

What are you doing?
What do you look like,
last night was over.

But why?

It 's just a game.
This is nonsense! And you know it.

I did?

You do not even know my name.

So, tell me!

No problem, I can not be with anyone.

This means to me.

Why are you doing this?

Hey Bill,

Did you have breakfast?
Fast, Travis.

What are you doing here Hanna?
Vicky concerned about her daughter.

Cabin not far from here.

Where Becker?

He was headed north about an hour
ago, at the police station.

Want me to join you?

No need to.

As you wish.

Good.

That's where my father seriously
wounded close to home.

He pulled the trigger himself,
screams and then die.

Someone had shot him.

Want to know what I do?

Clean with a garden hose.

Comb your hair,

Remove the road and wait
someone found me.

Where did you find it?

My brother.

He closed the tube and take me away.

What happens then?

Many foreigners, and the police came to the house.

People think of where I left off.

My father was a bad person.

And the animals.

And he deserves to die that way.

I had to grow up.

As others have a husband and a home.

And they have their children.

Instead, I screwed up.

Lisa.

My name is Lisa.

I'm James.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

What is Hanna? Why are we stopping?

Friends, do not seem to leave here.

Strange, is not it?
So what?

(MOTOR Sound Machine)

Becker, do you?
Hey, what are you doing?

I asked for help Becker.
Because there are only snowmobile and walk?

While it is argued
I'm going to do my job.

We have to check.

Okay, so we have to check but it goes
Becker called when there was nothing?

You're going to get in trouble.
Message from Becker to call.

Becker, do you?

What the fuck, you can not do it!
I can do what?

What an asshole.

Hello!

Bobby!

Hello?

Official sheriff.

Hello?

You'll have to let us
in the problem, Hanna.

I know it's early.

We just like to have a quick word.

Oh my God!

Hello?

Brice!

Move over, it's him!

Brice?

You're not an angel at all.
No, they are not.

Brice, are you okay?

Get out!

Come on!

Oh, shit!

Are you okay?

You should not even be here.

Damn it, Travis!

Travis!

You know this is my first snowman?

Your take me for a ride.

Not a lot of snow in Alabama.

I made nine
when I was a kid.

My father and I used to make
snowman in the desert like a wolf.

Two fighters snow
throwing punches.

I remember that I did not want
going to bed that night.

My father took me all
the way back home.

When I got off the podium in Beijing ...

... He's so fucking proud of myself.

Later in the locker room I told him,
I was leaving home to go to a professional.

I told him ..

I said that if I had a
coach's true, maybe I'll win the gold.

I still love him?

You ', I think. But ..
