What's up, son?

You finally found some time
to come see your old man?

No, Dad.

I'm only here because Mom
wouldn't stop bugging me

to come see you.

Yeah, your mom was telling me
Andy's getting big.

He's running around.

You know, the last time
she was here,

she was showing me
some pictures of the--

you know, like, the different
things you guys were doing--

Well, sounds like
you're all caught up, then.

Right?

Ah, come on.

I really don't want this time
to be like this.

Family.

Let me tell you something, Dad.

I dropped out of school
to take care of my family

'cause you were too busy
in the streets.

Our family?

I don't wanna fight with you

or hurt you guys.

I've changed, Juanito.

Watch when I get out.

Changed for what?

For us?

We're grown, Dad.

There's no need to change
for us anymore.

Sometimes, people,

they make bad choices

because of the situations
they put themselves in.

Yeah, I know.

I know.

And we all know what you chose.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

You're a good man.

You've grown into a good man,

and I'm proud of you.

Proud of me.

You don't even know me.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Here's what I know.

You're nothing like me.

And I'm proud of that.

<i>[line beeps]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>[upbeat Spanish music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Hurry up with those orders.

All right, all right.

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

What is this On Demand?
What do you mean, on demand?

"What do you mean, on--"

all of a sudden,
you don't know?

Mom.

What is this movie
right here?

It was one movie,
and it was for $3.99.

[child cries]
That's not even nothing.

Then how come there's five
of them in here, huh?

Baby, explain to me
why your mom thinks

that she can put movies
on demand when we have Netflix.

Hey, little--
She doesn't pay her bills!

Hey!
We end up paying!

Hey, little girl,
what you mean "explain to Mom?"

What, you think I don't know

how to use the TV
and pay the bills?

Mom!
Obviously, you don't.

Come on, baby, what's up?
Baby, that's it?

Oh, my God.

You got him crying.

Look, instead of crying
about it,

go wash that pot so I can cook.

I told you it's soaking!

Well, then, do the other one,

'cause if not,
it's not gonna be--

I'm over here
trying to figure out the bills!

All right, so go
do your bills and stop talking.

Then how come
you're not telling me about it?

What other bills we got
that I don't know about, huh?

I don't know.
Go look at 'em.

We got this.

We got this phone bill?
Huh?

Hey.

Did Juanito pay
the cell phone bill?

They don't say he did.

How is Vero--

how is he
supposed to pay the bills

when he's been working all day?

What did you say I said?

I said how is your brother
supposed to be paying bills

when he's working all day?

Don't worry about it.
I'll pay it tomorrow.

And why you gotta open
your big mouth like always?

Yeah.
I'll pay it tomorrow.

Vez, this is your problem.

You're always fixing her shit.

That's your problem.
Fuck you!

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come here, baby.

No, fuck you!

Why don't you contribute
around here?

The baby's freaking crying.
Hey, hey.

What, baby?
What's this?

What?
What is this shit?

Oh, you don't have to worry
about that.

What do you mean
it's nothing to worry about?

We're getting kicked out.
Are you kidding me?

I know, but if we just pay
what's due, we'll be okay.

How the fuck are we past due
on our rent?

Is there something
you're not telling me?

[cries]
Mama.

I've been helping your
grandmother with her bills.

She's gonna pay us back.
Are you fucking kidding me?

Plus they can't kick us out.

Yeah, Mom,
but why didn't you tell me?

Because I didn't want you
to worry.

So you used our money.

What the fuck, Ma?

I could've come up with some
extra money or something.

I didn't want you to worry,
okay?

I'm gonna take care of it.

Don't worry about it.

We have, like, 30 days,
maybe even more.

I've completely forgotten.

Like we have
that fucking luxury, right?

Baby.
This is bullshit.

I didn't know anything, baby.
Fuck!

Okay?

Your mom kept this shit
from me, all right?

What?
Bullshit!

Juan.
I didn't know, okay?

I didn't have any fucking--

<i>- You didn't know</i>
<i>about grandmother?</i>

<i>You didn't know</i>
<i>that I was helping?</i>

<i>- No, I did not know</i>

Oh, shit.

'Sup, man?
It's been a minute.

What's going on, man?

What's up, man?
Shit.

What's up, man?
Damn, Juanito.

Got you doing bitch work
up in here, man.

Yeah, right, homey.
It's not even like that, dawg.

[scoffs]
Man, you could've fooled me.

Let's go get a drink, my boy.

[sighs]

All right.

Come on, man.
Hop in.

<i>[rap music playing]</i>

So,

when'd they let you out?

I didn't think
they were ever gonna.

I don't know.
Two, three weeks ago.

A month.

Long enough to get back
into business stuff.

Ain't no stopping me.


I see you ain't doing shit.

[laughs]

Yeah, I'm just trying
to get by, man.

Make ends meet, you feel me?

Man, you ain't gonna
make nothing meet

doing what you doing
over there, man.

Yeah, well, I got a family
to take care of now.

Word is you knocked up
Adriana.

Snagged that bitch
right up, man.

Or was it the other way around?

All right, look, man,
you need to chill the hell out

with that shit.

You fucking play too much, man.

[chuckles]

Good for you.

Got your little family,
your little job.

It's good to see you
doing good, though, man.

Yeah.

[sirens wailing faintly]

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Thanks.

All right, man.
Well, good luck, homey.

I appreciate the ride.
Good talk, man.

Hey.

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Motherfucker, I can help you
get some real paper.

Man, fuck this place, man.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

I ain't even trying
to play that game, homey.

Ain't no fucking games
I'm playing.

The fuck do you think this is?

I'm trying to get you paid.


What happened
to my down-ass homey?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Offer don't last long, bro.

You know where to find me.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[phone buzzing]

[sighs]

Shit.

Fuck.

<i>[Spanish music playing]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

We opened two hours late
because of you.

Come on, it was an accident.
I--

I got a family
to take care of.

Two businesses to run.

I wanna sleep in.

But I gotta be here.

Go home, Juan.

Raul.
Go home.

You, my friend,

The first drop you're going to
is with Flaco and Chino.

You remember those fools?

They're down as fuck.

Help me set up shop.

We're plugging
some big players.

You're lucky I like you, bro.

Letting you in
on this operation.

I'ma text you the address

From there, they got you.

Yeah, I got you.

Hi!

Hey.

What's up?
How you doing?

I'm good.
Good.

Good to see you.
Yeah.

How you been?

All right, but damn.

You look bad as fuck.
No disrespect.

Thank you.
Yeah.

Last time I saw you, you were--

[laughs]
A lot younger.

Yeah, I got a kid now

and all the stress
that comes with it.

I hear that,
but he's a lucky guy--

the father, I mean.

It's Juanito, my lucky guy.

J?
No.

J.

[laughs softly]

Juanito.
Fuck, I didn't know that.

[laughs]

Homey always had a way
with the ladies, I guess.

All right, well,
it was good seeing you.

Tell my boy to come find me.

All right,
let him know I miss him.

Okay, I will.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Hey, you need a ride?

Nah, it's okay.

You sure?
I don't mind.

No, no, no, they're probably
just running late.

Well, it kind of looks like
they forgot about you.

Come on.
I didn't park too far.

We get home.
Hopefully J's there.

We all catch up,

like old times.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Okay.

Take me home.
Now, don't be like that.

Let's just kick it
for a little bit.

Kick it?

Fuck no.
Take me home.

You too good
to kick it with me now?

You weren't too good
for my ride.

Oh, fuck no.
That's what this is?

No, no.
I'm fucking out of here.

Thanks for the ride.

Where the fuck

Get the fuck off of me.

We gonna make

Hey, when we get there,
don't say shit.

Just let us introduce you.

Yeah, all right.

So what's up, Juanito?

It's been a long time
since you've been around.

Too scared to kick it
with the homies or what?

Nah, it's not even
like that, dawg.

[laughs]
All of a sudden.

Thought you forgot
about the homies.

Hey, bro, shut the fuck up.

We're almost there.

Hey, you trippin'.

No.

He did.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Quit talking, man,

Man, I had your back!

Had my back?

I remember doing
hard fucking time,

caged like a dog,

while you got let out.

Man, we both did time.
Don't give me that fucking shit.

Time?

You were 16.

They fucking tried you
as a fucking minor.

That's a fucking
slap on the hand.

I was 17,
just a few months older,

and they tried me
as a fucking adult.

Because of you, motherfucker,

I lost years!

You got your fucking bitch,

your fucking son,

a fucking life.

Like I said,
we both got caught up.

How the fuck was I supposed
to know how they tried us?

We were kids.
We were fucking kids.

We were fucking kids.

[laughing]

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Thank you, Juanito.

For what?

[laughing]

Had a lot of anger towards you.

I fucking hated you.


But I forgive you now.
