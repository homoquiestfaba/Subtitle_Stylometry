(foreboding music)

(distant police siren blaring)

Hey, what'cha got?

Thank you officer.

[Woman] Really?

[Officer] We haven't
 touched anything.

We've been waiting on y'all.

Two bodies inside,
 kicked in door.

Give or take, man, size 11.

A man was shooting
 after a woman.

Where's the woman?

ER, she was shot
 in the shoulder.

And the guy?

We surrounded him, told
 him to drop his weapon,

he shot himself.

We immediately identified
 him, Gambit Nelly, drifter.

In and out of prison,
 mostly aggravated assault.

Ah, one more thing.

Wherever I was checking
 around inside the house...

Well I went and looked
in some of the rooms...

Something ain't right in there.

It's just not the best way
 that you wanna start your day.

Right.

Looking forward to it.

Yeah...

(ominous music)

How's it coming, anything?

Nothing yet.

You?

[Male forensic specialist]
 There aren't any prints.

I need a toxicology
 report as soon as possible.

Sure, I'll run that
 by the lab for you.

No signs of a struggle,

or attempted retaliation.

Nails are intact,
 they're not broken.

It's a single shot to the head.

Now it would appear that
projected high velocity

blood splatter was transferred

and she was shot in
 a seated position.


But when she shot herself,
 I mean that would explain

the 9mm handgun.

Dr. Gates, I'm
 detective Salinas

and this is detective Farrell.

[Dr. Gates] Good
 morning detectives.

I've heard a lot of
 good things about you,

I'm reading your latest book,

"The Psychosis of
 the Criminal Mind".

Uhm, any first impressions?

[Dr. Gates] I
 think the two victims

liked to roll in
their own filth.

Well the doors were kicked in.

Maybe they were already dead?

[Farrell] Both victims
already dead in their own house?

Something here is not right.

Well maybe he
 accidentally overdosed

and she took her own life,
 like Shakespeare said,

"A normal man can
 not be without love."

It's not Romeo and Juliet.

(anticipating music)

Why would there be
 a bullet in the wall?

Well according
 to Officer Roberts,

the neighbor who called
was still on the line

with 911 when three more
gunshots were heard.

[Operator] What's
 the emergency?

I hear gunshots next door.


(ominous music)

[Farrell] These
 sadist motherfuckers

just might be the weirdest
 my career has ever seen.

Or will ever see.

You've seen that collection
 of sex toys in here?

Sex toys?

[Farrell] Why won't
 this drawer open?

I bet somebody kept all their
 little goodies right in here.

Damn this thing
 really is sealed shut.

I've seen this
 before, in a book.

Some pretty sadistic
 containment.

I think they were
lowered down with ropes,

that's from the 15th century,
 why would we create it now?

[Farrell] Almost got it.

Let's see what's
behind door number one.


Farrell!

Officer down, help me, help me!

Officer down, no, no,
 help me, officer down!

[Voiceover] Are we on?

[Voiceover] Yeah.

We're live at the crime
 scene, I am standing

in front of the house
 where at four o'clock

this morning neighbors
 heard gunshots.

When the police arrived
they found a young man

shooting a woman, that
 young man was asked

repeatedly to drop his
 weapon, he refused,

and shot himself.

When police inspected the
 building they found two bodies

which were later confirmed to
 be the alleged serial killers.

[Dr. Gates] There is something
very very wrong here chief.

Are you trying to suggest
 something, Dr. Gates?

Not at all, I'm simply
trying to point out

that this was preventable.

I don't think you
 understand the limited ability

of police work, Dr. Gates.

Sure, in your analytical,
 academic point of view,

this might have
 been preventable.

But in the real world
 where I live and breathe,

things are very different.

They're waiting for us.

(anticipating music)

[Various journalists]
Chief, chief, chief!

[Voiceover] Chief, do
you have any suspects?

[Voiceover] Do you
have a lead on suspects?

The DA has asked me to
give a statement for him

as well as the
 police department.

These are certainly the
worst events we've seen,

during my 20 years on the force.

But after meeting with
 state and local officials

this morning I can assure
 the people of Fieldhouse

that we have the best law
 enforcement on the case.

We will get to
 the bottom of this

and see that justice is done.

And whoever is responsible
 for these killings will pay.

These murders took
 place on McCoy Street,

but the murder victim
 identities will

not be released at this time.

Authorities also
believe that the victims

themselves may be tied to
 a list of other murders.

Unfortunately during
 the investigation

earlier this morning,
 Fieldhouse police lost one.

Detective Farrell was
 killed in the line of duty.

It is believed that the
house was booby trapped,

and we have been
 asked to back down now

while the house is thoroughly
 searched for other devices.

There will be a memorial
 service for Detective Farrell

in the next few days,
 may he rest in peace

and may God be with us.

(various journalists
 shout over each other)

[Bald man] Hey, over here!

These dark souls, who
 you are now getting

acquainted with,
 are finally dead.

And for that, I thank God.

You know you all
 are a fucking joke.

Y'all knew for years some
 crazy ass shit like this

was bound to be going
 down and did nothing.

So don't sit there and say
 you're going do anything.

What needed to be
done, it's a done deal.

Those dark souls,
 they up outta here.

No one can be hurt
 by them anymore.

Fuck this.

(various journalists
 shout over each other)

No more questions
thank you for you time.

There will be another
 briefing tomorrow at 11 AM.

[Voiceover] Is it true
that a witness was shot

and is now missing?

[Voiceover] Chief Gonzales!

[News Anchor] And
 after the break.

The middle ages are back.

Alleged serial killers'
bodies were found today

and a replica of the
 worst torture devices used

in that century.

When local authorities
 were contacted today,

neighbors reported hearing
 gunshots come from the house.

They found more
 evidence which raises

even more questions
 in this investigation.

(faint police siren blaring)

I know, look, I couldn't
 believe it either.

Commando, you really
 need to come--

Excuse me?

Yes, how can I
 help you officer?

The shooting in McCoy Street.

The woman with a gunshot wound.

Yeah she came in earlier,

she was right down the
 hall, but she left.

(the woman speaks Spanish)

I need a ticket
 to Piedras Negras.

Next available.

The next one is boarding
 now, is that okay?

Yeah, that's fine.

Any luggage?

No.

Okay, your total
 is 32 dollars.

Thank you for riding
 Don Luis Buslines.

[Driver] Hey, welcome aboard.

Thank you.

Welcome aboard.

Bienvenidos, welcome aboard.

Thank you, welcome aboard.

Is everyone on board?

(foreboding music)

Hey, what's wrong?

Uhm, I think I'm just...

I'm just worried about
 the future, you know.

It's like I can't visualize it.

You know what I mean?

Okay, you just need
 to relax, breathe.

And take it easy.

Tell me what's really going on.

Is this because of Alex?

Did he call?

Yeah.

And, what did you say?

I didn't answer.

What, why what happened?

Because it's like,
 when we broke up,

I walked away and
 he walked away.

And he didn't even
 turn around to see if

there was some sort of
 reconciliation, you know.

It's like when you
 really love someone,

you turn around to see if
 they're still there and...

He just kept walking.

Your life is no
 romantic Hollywood movie.

I've never met or
 heard of anyone

that that actually happened to.

I mean, love isn't real.

Wake up Mila.

It's just a four letter word

that people use to
 get married and laid.

It's so powerful,
 but it just becomes

overused and meaningless.

I guess you're right, I
 mean who knows if someone

is really being honest
 with you, right?

It's like the moment
 someone lays eyes on you,

their lies immediately start.

I really felt like I...

I thought it was real.

Hey, something for
 all that one person,

won't ever change the way
 that they perceive love.

Yeah, I see why.

Then give up on it.

They think everyone
 is out to get them

and to use them.

Yeah, you're right.

I've been busting my ass
for years already, so...

New York City, here we come.

You know, it's just, it's
 not like he can't come,

you know, he just
 didn't want to, so...

That's because you
 two are incompatible.

You don't like
anything that he likes.

He's way too chilled and
 you are so freaking uptight.

I mean who's the one
 who's always getting angry

when he doesn't have a
 plan for the evening?

Sometimes you just overreact.

And you don't?

Me, I'm perfect.

All we ever do is
 fighting anyways,

so in a way I'm kinda
 glad we broke up.

Hey, I know you're
better off without him.

You know I have to go.

Already?

I know...

There's just something
 I've been wanting to say.

What?

I'm glad you finally found
 the courage to leave Alex.

Why?

Because he's a loser.

Stop.

He's not going anywhere.

If his parents
 didn't have money...

Too soon?

Maybe a bit.

Gonna miss you.

Gonna miss you too, thanks.

Why did you change
 your voicemail?

I got your call last
 night, I wanted to call you

but figured you would be out.

I really wanted to see
 you, so we can talk.

But I guess it's too late
 now and I gotta be up early.

Uhm, I'll be stopping
 by my mom's house,

so you can call me there.

(foreboding music)

How long 'till we get there?

I'm fucking tired.

Chill out, alright.

Your face and mine are
 all over the news by now.

I'm not going to risk
it and go back to prison

with all those fucking pussies.

Damn Skippy.

[Distorted radio]
 A patient has escaped

from a Colorado
 psychiatric ward.

Later an informant
 led police officers

to a house in Grand Junction
 where two women were killed.

Due to the graphic
nature of the killings,

they were believed
 to be in connection

with the escaped patient.

Subsequent information
 from investigators reveals

a grisly message was left at
 the crime scene by the killer.

(anticipating music)

Hey.

What took you all so
long, you were supposed

to be here yesterday.

Shit doesn't
 always go as planned.

Hey Gam, you're
 blazed, gimme some.

Go ahead, you just
 have to spark it.

Fuck.

(car electronics beeping)

Shit.

Help...

What the fuck?


Mommy, mommy, mommy...

(ominous music)

(faint crying baby)

Yeah, can I help you?

Yes, my car is completely
 dead down the road.

Could you please
give me a boost?

I mean I've got all the
wires and everything.

Ah, yeah well I don't
 wanna seem rude or anything,

but, you know, we're
 kind of in the middle

of making dinner and
getting the kids to bed.

I'm sorry, but could
 you please help me,

all I need is a boost, sir.

Like, the thing is, I have
 a really important flight

to catch for a job
 in New York City.

Pretty please?

Yeah I guess if
 you wanna come on in

and make a phone call, you
 can call yourself a cab.

Guess that'd be okay.

Okay.

(ominous music)

(crying baby)

(struggling and groaning)

(anticipating music)



[Mila] (shouting) Help!

Help!

Help me, please help me,
 I've just been kidnapped,

please, there's a
 house up the hill,

they have a baby I
don't think it's theirs,

please help me.

Please, (blurting out words)...

Ah, ah!

(anticipating music)

Ah man, get that
 bitch outta here.

(foreboding music)

Yeah, how can I help you?

My daughter Mila has
 been missing for 24 hours.

Her car is just a mile away.

Have you seen her?

Well you know ma'am,
we uh, live pretty close

to the desert, so you know,

people go missing
every week around here.

Well would you take another
 look please at the picture?

And call me if you see her?

Yeah, yeah, I'll do that.

Hello?

Hello?!

(anticipating music)


Oh baby, Mila, Mila
 come on, come on Mila,

it's okay, it's okay,
 sweetie it's okay.

(crying and whimpering)

Baby it's mommy, mommy,
mommy, baby, it's mommy,

you're going to be
 okay, no, no, no,

sweetie it's okay,
 going to be okay.

Hey!

What the fuck are you doing?

Wanna join the party bitch, huh?

Fuck you.

Yeah, that's
 right, let's do it.


(foreboding music)

You do realize we're
 going to my parents, right?

And?

I asked you to
 wear something decent

and you come out in this.

Oh who cares.

And this is stupid,
 we always fight.

Yeah, well if only you
didn't give me a reason.

Where's your restroom?

Over there, ma'am.



Well, well, well,
 look what I found.

A little mousey in
 the cat house huh?

Please, please
 don't kill me, please.

[Bald man] Oh
 shut the fuck up!


[Preppy guy] Here
 you take my wallet--

Get the fuck outta
 here with that.

Please, don't kill me, please.

I want your keys, give
me your fucking keys.

Here, just take
 it please, just...

Where's that bitch
 you walked in with?

I don't know.

Where's that fucking bitch
 you walked in with huh?

I don't...

Don't fucking lie to me.

What are you crying for, what
 the fuck is wrong with you?

Please don't...

Please don't what,
 please don't what?

Please don't kill me.

Huh?!

Please...

[Bald man] You little bitch.

No...


Six whole fucking dollars
 man, you gotta be shitting me.

What did I miss?

What the fuck are you doing?

What are you, what is
 this with this girl?

I was just gonna show you.

And what the fuck
were you gonna show me?

Tada.

I'm over here putting in
 work, getting money for us

and you're in there fucking
 killing bitches, that's great.

Would you prefer I
 put them in the trunk,

take them for a joyride?

You better watch
 your mouth boy.

You know the only reason
I came out this way

was to get Hersey.

Oh and that was a
brilliant fucking idea.

Let's go get psycho bitch
 from the mental hospital,

that won't attract attention.

Where are we going?

I'm not going back
 to Fieldhouse.

Oh-ho, yes you are.

No.

No.

[Bald man] Hersey,
 let's go baby.

(ominous music)

Shut the fuck up.

(crying and whimpering)

(psychotic laughter)

(heavy breathing and whimpering)

You're still crying, huh, hmmm?


Shut the fuck up, shut
 the fucking fuck up.

You hear me?

You wanna scream, go ahead...

Go ahead, scream,
 it won't matter.

You're mine, bitch,
 you understand me?

You'll be going when
 I tell you to go.

Stand up, stand up.

(screaming and whimpering)

What the fuck is wrong with
 you, you fucking bitch!

(thrilling music and screaming)

(shouting) Help,
 no please, help me!



You're done.

I wish I could just kill you.

Right now (spits).

Stop, please...

Look at you.

You're disgusting.

Too bad Dale is keeping
you as his little pet.


Oh you fucking bitch, I'm
 gonna fucking kill you...

Oh no, you ain't.

Now listen up.

I need your to shut your mouth

and don't scream.

Cause we're having
 guests tonight.

What's up, what are you doing?

[Dale] Watching a little TV.

The fuck are you so happy for?

What, can't a girl be smiling

and cheerful in her own house?

Not without my
 permission, baby.

(deep voice) Not without
 my permission, baby.

I'm glad I'm back home.

[Dale] Yeah?

[Hersey] Uhuh.

[Dale] I'm glad
 you're back too.

So who comes up with all this?

Hollywood, duh.

I like Godfather.

But there's just too
 much shit out there, man.

Now see that's just a
medium to get the dough.

See, it's all about the money.

It's like a waitress,
 if she goes to work,

she gets that money.

Of course you wouldn't
know nothing about that

since your ass ain't
 never had a job.

Ah, shut up!

You're such a fucking
 asshole to think

I don't get stupid demented
 shit like that, fuck!

Come on.

Don't be mad.

You know I read the article.

Yeah, yeah.

Let's get daddy a
 little sugar, hmm?

(faint electronic music)

What's up?

Her over there, she
 just snorted cocaine.

Nah, nah, nah, her.

She looks good, she
 looks real good.

Hey?

Hmm?

You good?

Yeah, I'm good.

You ready to do the
 devil's work, baby?

Okay, just like we planned?

See I like this,
 it's like were spies.

We're undercover agents.

What the fuck?

(door opening and slamming shut)

(foreboding music and footsteps)

(distant mumbling and grumbling)



You know what, to be
 honest, I'm not too happy

with tonight's prize.

Well if you were
 a little less weird,

then we might have hooked
 up with that other chick.

Where's my money?

It's in the other room.

But you should wash up first.

Sure.

Nazdrovje...

You're so fucking hot baby.

I'm so ready...

Can you do me first?


[Hersey] That's
 far enough, bitch.

Is she really dancing?


You stupid bitch!

Get that bitch.


[Dale] Sit your ass down.

You walked into the devil's
 room and you will pay.

[Hersey] You
 wanna fuck, bitch?

(groaning and screaming)

Stank ass whore!

(shrieking and screaming)

Bitch, fucking whore.

You got blood all over me.

[Dale] Hey.

I got some breakfast for you.

I'm thirsty.

You have to ask me nicely.

Please, I'm hungry...

I can't hear you!

Please, please...

I can't...

Come on you fucking...

Here.


You fucking bitch!

[Hersey] What the
 hell is going on here?

Oh you bitch!

(thumping, groaning and moaning)

(sad music)

(panting and heaving)

Ssshht, ssshht, ssshht...

[Woman] No please...

Ssshht, ssshht, ssshht...

[Woman] Please let me
go, let me go, please...

What are you doing, what
are, what are you doing?

[Dale] Don't
 worry, don't worry.

No, no...

Shut your mouth,
 shut your mouth.


(mumbling and laughter)

[Hersey] Hey, you
 want another beer?

Hey you.

Ssshht, ssshht, ssshht...

Hey, hey, don't cry, don't cry.

(whimpering) What's that, no,
please, please, no please...

Hey, listen to
 me, listen to me!

Alright, don't say a
word, don't say a word,

you understand me?

Shut your mouth.

(whimpering and crying)

Ssshht, ssshht, ssshht...


Get in.

Get in!

(whimpering and crying)

Sit, sit!

You're not even that pretty.

It's not like
 you're fucking, hmm?

[Mila] You should let me go.

Plus, I'm better
 looking than you.

[Mila] Just, just
 let me go, please...

[Hersey] No, no no.

He'll eventually get
 tired of you, sweetie.

I promise I won't
 tell anyone, please...

No one will ever find out...

Please...

[Hersey] No.

We're just getting started.

We're gonna kill you

over and over

and over again.

(whimpering and crying)

[Dale] What the fuck?

[Hersey] There's
 a show tonight.

First of all, you wanna
 take your foot off the table?

(Dale is eclipsed by
 the creaking wood)

There's a show tonight.

And?

And I wanna go.

You wanna go where?

To the show, tonight.

We're not going anywhere.

So we're gonna stay here?

That's right, boo-fucking-hoo,

we're staying right here.

We're gonna stay
 here, with that girl?

[Dale] That's exactly right.

[Hersey] With your
 fucking friend, that girl.

[Dale] We're not
 having this conversation.

You're damn right I'm not
having a conversation fuck this.

Hey!

Alright fine man.

Alright fine.

You're gonna go,
 I'll go with you.

(grunting and screaming)

(anticipating music)

[Voiceover] Well,
 you're finally up huh?

You know you were out for
 almost 30-something hours,

you're lucky I didn't
 have no appointments.

What happened,
 your man beat you?

(door knocking)

Yeah hold on!

Give me a minute.

I said hold the fuck on!

Finally coming over here
acting like I got time

to deal with them.

Well come on in this house,
 just don't slam my door.

Shit!

Everybody always be coming
 around here slamming my door,

shaking my house and everything.

I'm sorry Octavia, alright
look I was just passing through

to check up on what we
talked about yesterday.

Hmm-mm, I'm listening.

Is she cool?

Should I come back later?

Nah, she cool.

Boy you go on and
 tell me why you here,

and you better be
 trying to talk me into

giving your sister
 some kind of discount.

Because if you is, you may
 as well walk on outta here.

Now my going rate is 50
 dollars, no more, no less.

You get the money, bring your
 sister over and it's done.

I don't need nobody
 coming around here

trying to talk me into
some kind of price cut.

Boy you better pawn some
of those video games

or sell something,
 cause like I said,

my price ain't changing.

Hah, it's a funny
 story I tell ya.

See what happened
 was, I got 20 dollars.

[Octavia] Boy get your
broke ass outta here,

I gotta deal with her now,
 get your ass outta here.

But, but, I got a microwave
 with an oven, it's brand new.

[Octavia] I don't give
 a fuck about no microwave,

you better take your
 ass and get a job.

Motherfucker, ain't nobody
 got time to deal with him.

It's business, not personal.

I don't care who you
 are, no compromise.

Do you have a
 phone I could use?

Hold on, before
 I lend you phone,

you tell me what happened.

I, I've been held
 against my own will.

I need to contact the police.

Nah-ah, not with my phone.

Girl I don't need no
 heat or nobody else

coming around here
 investigating.

Sitting on my couch, expecting
 coffee and fucking cookies.

Look around.

Now there's a pay
 phone downstairs,

you can call from there.

I was screaming for
 days, I know somebody

must have heard me and I could
 hear everything outside...


Girl, you just ain't from
 around here, that's all.

Now maybe where you
 from, rich folks got cops

at their fingertips.

But around here,
 cops only swing by

when there are dead bodies,

and I bet you they ain't gonna
 do nothing about this either.

This ain't weird.

A woman screaming?

Girl they ain't coming
 around here for that.

But you know, my momma might
 have a place for you to stay.

She owns this strip
 club and the old girl,

who just moved out, was
renting a room there.

She might be cool with
you using her phone too,

I don't know, you
 can ask for that.

Well, come on in.

I just got off the
 phone with Octavia.

What happened to you?

Look, I don't
 want to burden you,

I'm sorry, I'm just gonna go.

Where are you gonna go?

And if you had somewhere you
 would've been there by now.

You're no burden, but if
 you wanna leave, go ahead.

I'm cooking, I gotta
go check on this pasta.

I think it's ready.

You hungry?

Yes.

Come on baby.

Go ahead.

(sad music)

What happened to you?

Where you from?

You ain't from around here

cause I ain't ever
 seen you before.

I'm from Utah.

What you doing around here?

I don't know.

Now who's done this to you?

I was kidnapped.

By this strange couple

and this white guy.

I don't know who they were,

I've never seen
 before in my life.

But I may be able to find out.

I took this book.

Is there anybody
 you need to call?

Where is your momma?

They killed her.

Nothing I can say can help you

through what you
 just went through.

Nor your loss.

But those who done
 this need to pay.

Whoever they are,
 they need to pay.

I suppose you haven't
 reported this?

I was going to, but...

Octavia says she don't
 want anyone coming around.

Especially the cops.

Well she has a warrant
out and hadn't had

time to pay it off.

And I think she's just
 a little paranoid.

But you can use my
 phone if you want to.

I can even take you to
 the police department.

I just don't understand why
 they haven't been reported.

You know...

They killed three women.

One every other day and
they were, they were...

Meticulous to where
 they did and it's like

they were programmed, you know,

they knew exactly what to do.

This could've
 happened to anyone.

Why me?

I just wanna make things right.

Here in Texas the death
 penalty will serve them good.

We just have to
 go file a report.

The court system
 won't just charge them

with one puny offense
 of kidnapping.

And one had just got out of

the psychiatric
 ward in Colorado.

My mother's body is
 somewhere in that desert.

And then you'll have two
 different police deparments

working together which usually
 never helps the case, so...

No.

I don't know nothing
 about that lingo.

But you sound like you know
 what you talking about.

You survived, you made it out
 and you can change things.

Don't want you to let these
 mean people change you baby.

Some people are just
 mad at the world.

get ready to go to work.

But you have a place
 to stay for now.

Till you figure
 things out, okay?

Okay.

[Octavia's mother] Alright.

(hip hop music)

Now, here is your locker key.

The old girl that
 lived in this room

I'm about to show you, moved
 out about two weeks ago.

Old girl left some clothes here.

You might be able to fit 'em.

Yep, you might.

All I kept thinking was...

I wasn't ready to die.

That's all I kept thinking.

Over and over and over.

(sad music)

Maybe, that gut feeling,
 was God lifting you up.

I'll help you in whatever I can.

You can stay as
 long as you need to.

What you gonna do, baby?

I don't know.

I just wanna forget about it.

Let me tell you something.

It was my birthday and I was--

This is Gem, she works here.

So you'll see around a lot.

She practically lives here.

Well, I was at this bar, me
 and my guy just broke up, so,

you know, I was
 there all by myself.

I wanted to order a drink
 and pay for it myself

when this guy just,
 buys it for me.

Which I felt was
 kinda cute, you know.

Coming off an abusive, somewhat,
neglected relationship.

I looked at him, he
looked good, clean cut.

A break from the norm.

I was attracted because
he was so good looking.

Like a, model or actor.

Could've been both.

And again drinking,
 well, it was my birthday.

And we ended up
 in his apartment.

Like it happened so quickly.

He caught me off guard.

I thought he was
 gonna give me a hug,

but it was no hug.

He was applying some
 type of, choke hold.

I've never felt
 anything like it.

When I say I lost air, I mean,
 I felt myself passing out.

I have a collapsed lung
 so I know it wasn't a hug.

It was pure evil.

He showed no remorse.

I pleaded, I begged
 and I begged...

Shit, like you, I don't
know how I'm here.

I'm just glad that I am.

When you walked in, I knew
 you weren't from around here.

What do you mean?

Just remember, that
 in life sometimes

you're gonna be dealing
with the Pit Bulls.

And if you slap one of them,
 they're gonna bite you back.

I know what you're thinking.

Don't let it consume you.

It's something which
 ain't worth it.

Mila, this is Big D.

Whatever you need,
 this is the go-to guy.

[Driver] Ah ladies
 and gentlemen,

there's some time
 to have a break,

I gotta check the tires
and some other stuff,

get some food or whatever

but, you have to
 get out of the bus.

And thank you again for
 riding, Don Luis Buslines.

(faint hip hop music)

[Doctor] Hey,
 you're just in time.

Hope you have some good news.

Not for these guys,
 our male vic died of

acute heroin and
 morphine intoxication.

Apparently he was given
too much accidentally,

or it was more potent
 than he thought.

He has alcohol in his system.

Any other substances?

Other than heroin,
 morphine and alcohol, no.

What about her?

This young lady died
 of a gunshot wound

straight to the head,
 right above the right ear.

I sent the bullet
 off to ballistics,

but other than that,
I'm still working on it.

Okay, well I'll get
 back to you later.

Hey, are you doing okay?

Yeah, why?

Farrell, his wounds
 are long and deep

but the impact was
 instantly fatal.

Can we just focus on
 this case, just this case,

I wanna focus on this case.

Yes, of course.

I just wanna be
 done with today,

tomorrow is another
 day, tomorrow,

is gonna be different, tomorrow.

Okay, take care of yourself.

Good luck, I think
 you're gonna need it.

(door knocking)

You needed to talk to me, sir?

[Gonzales] Yes,
 Salinas, thank you.

It's my understanding that you
 are in charge of this case?

Now before you say
 anything, just let me say

I know that detective
Farrell was your partner

and I'm very sorry
 for your loss.

Thank you sir.

The DA seems to think it might
have an impact on the case.

No, I--

They think that there's a
 connection to your crime scene

with a cold case from
 a few years back.

Forensics found some prints
 from some of the vics,

and so we are going
 to take it from here.

Now if you will excuse me.

Sir, I need to talk to you!

No, not now Salinas,
 I've got a meeting.

Chief, you have to let
me work on that case.

Let me be the one
 who brings it in!

I can't, I don't have
 jurisdiction, I wish I could.

But with all due
respect, I can find her,

I can interrogate her
 and I can get us--

Salinas, pride is a sin,
 but I like your persistence,

but sorry, nothing personal.

Come on chief,
you and I know--

You are not gonna stop
 asking about this, are you?

No.

Fine.

You follow everything in
 that file, you understand?

I'll call the deputy
and tell him (mumbling).

Thank you chief.

(ominous music)

(door knocking)

Coming.

(door knocking)

FPD, open up.

I said 30 minutes
 ma'am, look what you did.

FPD, where are
your passengers?

I told them 30 minutes ma'am,
they're surely not in there.

Look I only have five
minutes to eat my lunch,

then I begin boarding.

Been driving this bus for hours,

is it okay if eat or what?

[Salinas] Shit.

(anticipating music)

Put your hands up.

Spread your legs.

Do you have anything sharp
 in your pockets, any weapon?

[Mila] No.

I'm starting to get
used to these handcuffs.

I'm detective Salinas, I'm
 investing a double homicide,

we need to talk to you.

We're leaving?

I can't leave.

I need permission to leave.

Don't be a smart ass.

We're in the middle of
 a murder investigation

of what happened
in McCoy Street.

You're needed for
questioning and prints.

So I can't leave?

After I question
 you, yeah maybe,

if you're innocent.

Two people were murdered
 and the only witness we have

gets up and leaves
 without a statement

or a police report.

So let me guess.

You think I killed those people?

I was attacked by them.

That doesn't give
 you the right to kill.

The consequences
 apply to everyone.

You're right, you're right.

I'm just gonna
 keep my mouth shut.

Go ahead.

You do have the
right to remain silent.

(foreboding music)

Can I tell you something?

Sure, about the case?

No, it's personal.

Yeah sure.

About a week ago, after
 I escaped from that house,

I was picked up by this
 amazing wonderful, woman.

I can tell you one thing,
 some people were just

born to help.

And this woman was a
perfect example of that.

Someone who is just
 driven by kindness.

I'm just saying I don't
 know how to be like that.

[Salinas] Well, you
 can't expect to be perfect.

This woman should inspire you,

if you think about it,

she was placed in your
 life for a reason.

I never heard
 anything like that.

I'm a little nervous
 to go back there.

Especially knowing what I know.

Know, what do you know?

Some information
 about Chief Gonzales.

His involvement.

Yeah, right.

It's true.

What makes you say that?

I'm not saying another word.

If you'd like I can show you.

So you can see for yourself.

It's in my backpack.

And by the way, I didn't do it.

Well truthfully, things are
 not looking too good for you.

I'm sorry I can't
 help you on this.

I'm gonna drop you off
 in a couple of miles.

That's it?

After I tell you, you're
just gonna ignore it

and follow orders?

A guilty man needs to pay!

Come on, that's crazy!

I have direct orders, there's
 a chain of command here.

(loud crash)

(foreboding music)

[Mila] Put them on.

Sit down.

You know you're not
getting away with this.

Does it look like I'm in
 the position to give a fuck?

I'm the one with the gun, okay?

You should've listened,
you should've listened,

but you didn't, okay?

You just wanted to follow
 orders instead of taking

this opportunity to
 set things right.

You're just a
 selfish little bitch.

Hey, take it easy.

You know you're not
getting away with this.

Let's just talk about
 what happened, okay?

Before we go on any
 further, you should know that

I'm specialized in
 forensic psychology.

I also have a license
 to handle a gun,

so it's not gonna go off
or anything like that.

And about your little
 incident here...

I just wanna leave,
 okay, go away.

But any plans I had are
 just pretty much all ruined.

So what kind of
information do you have?

You have all my attention,
 just take these cuffs off me.

Unlike you, I'm
 not fond of them.

Look around, no
 one knows we're here.

You could easily let me go.

I can't.

So let's see what you have.

I conducted research
on certain psychological

conditions, and found
 that these killers

had some serious
 personality disorders.

Low self-esteem, among
many other things, so...

So you escape and you
do some research, why?

To understand them.

Sympathize with them.

And take my first step
 in forgiving them.

Bullcrap, I don't
 believe a word.

Inside this book is a
 written report for the court

detailing all my
 psychological findings

upon which my
 conclusions are based on.

I guess I just don't want the
 chief to get a hold of it.

Get in the car.

Get in the fucking car.

(ominous music)

Hands, let me see
 your hands, now!

Drop the gun, gently
 on the ground, now.

Out of the car, now.

Clasp your hands behind
your neck, over there.

Salinas uncuff yourself.

(anticipating music)

I'm Detective Borne,
 I followed you here

on direct orders
 from Chief Gonzales,

in case there was a problem,
 which was brilliant of him.

I can assure you that
you're safe now, ma'am.

You're not guilty,
 we all know that.

You're just scared, right?

Yes.

I'm not guilty.

Just no handcuffs, please.

I'm sorry, standard procedure.

Cuff her Salinas.

We're gonna cuff you
 and we'll put you

in the back of the car.

We'll ask you a
 couple of questions

and then you can go.

Salinas, you okay?

Yeah, I'm okay.

[Borne] Alright then,
come on, let's go.

Whenever you're
 ready, we can begin.

(foreboding music)

I'm glad you're still here.

I just have a few questions.

And please don't make
 my job any harder.

You already crashed my car.

Look I told you I'm
 not saying anything.

Okay listen, cause I'm only
 gonna tell you this once.

I was walking in the street,

that's when Gambit saw me.

The white guy, he
 started following me.

He took me back to the house
 and they started fighting.

Afterwards one of the
 serial killers was dead...

What killer?

Dale.

Then he shot Hersey and
then he started chasing

me around the house,
 shooting at me.

That's when I ran out the house

and next thing I knew
 I was at the hospital

with a gunshot wound.

So I left.

You do realize you
 were fleeing the country,

by leaving for Mexico?

Isn't that weird if you're
 innocent, as you say?

Well that's my statement
 and it is not changing.

And I'm saying another
 word 'till I get my lawyer.

Okay, agreed, one
(door slams shut) for me

and have one for you.

It's kinda big...

Hah, yes it is.

Thank you, it's
 really excellent work.

I'm gonna go see if I can
 get some more information

out of her, and Detective
 Borne, he is waiting outside,

he'll take you back
 to the station.

I'll talk to you
when I get back.

Appreciate your help.

Ah, my head...



(foreboding music)

[Gonzales] You did this?

Your idea of a fucking joke?

Come into my town, terrorize
 it, and then leave?

[Mila] I didn't do that.

And you don't scare me.

You sit at your desk and
 you act like you're a cop?

There's a crime pattern,
a trail of dead bodies

and murdered women all
 along Interstate 40

from Oklahoma to Texas that
 leads straight into this town.

You knew all along
 who was doing it

and you let the
 killings continue.

But because your
 remorse was so much

bigger than your puny
 ass little brain...

You thought the
fatherly thing to do was

to help your son cover
up murder after murder?

I mean why tarnish
 your reputation

because of a relationship you
 had with the town's whore?

And your son, Dale.

Your name is written on
his birth certificate

out in Houston, but it's a
 big secret out here, isn't it?

But what about the victims?

Fuck 'em, right?

That was the right and moral
 thing to do, wasn't it?

But tell me, how did it feel,

to wrap your fingers
 around Ms. Rodgers throat?

And then hang her afterwards?

And cover it up with
 such excellence?

Who the fuck are you?

[Mila] Nobody.

Does it matter?

You wanna teach me
 like you taught Dale?

Look bitch, you
 just crossed the line,

and since you're pushing I'm
 fucking going there with you,

you are as good as dead.

(heavy breathing)

Wrapping my fingers
 around her neck,

that ex-wife is, it's
just like 20 years ago.

I walked into that house
and I walked upstairs

and she is there
touching my son.

And in the divorce
 she gets custody.

I, I am denied visitation.

And that bitch changes his name
from Dale just to spite me.

So I just drive for eight hours

and I settle right
 here in Fieldhouse.

Oh and then she
 decides to drive along

and settle here too.


But then I remarried and
the rest was history.

Look...

I will not hurt my family.

And I don't believe in doing
 the right thing when it

means that everything I love
 can be taken away from me.

Yeah so a few years back,
 I was sitting at my desk

analyzing some of the
killings on my computer.

And one of the murder
 weapons comes up.

It's a baseball bat.

Baseball bat that I had given
 Dale when he was 10 years old.

Yeah...

Imagine my surprise.

I knew it was him,

fucking little bastard.

Fuck this, fuck you.

Gah!

Okay, enough with the sad shit.

I've got things to do.

I need to go clear
 things up with the DA

and then my son has a soccer
 game with the Plainville Owls.

Do you like soccer?

Let's go.

Get up.

Let's walk and talk.

You would've made
 a good detective,

I read your reports,
 they're not bad.

A shame this is the
 end of the road.


[Salinas] Oh my God...

I heard everything.

This fucking asshole...

I left the recorder,
 (mumbling)...

I left the recorder, go grab it

in the interrogation room.

You give it to the
 right people, okay?

[Mila] I'm sorry.

I should've listened,
I should've listened.


Did you kill them?

[Mila] It's what you can't see

that causes the most damage.

(door knocking)

[Hersey] I'm getting the
 door, I am getting the door.

Shit, I'm looking
 like a stripper.

What the fuck?


(anticipating music)


(ominous music)
