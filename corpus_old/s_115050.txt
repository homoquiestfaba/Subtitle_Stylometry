Man: Trees have a secret life
that is only revealed

to those who are willing
to climb them.

I do not remember
when I was born.

But, when I was three
months old,

my mother returned
to my grandparents' home

with me as the proof
of her failure.

The splendor of my childhood
was unique,

because of its absolute poverty,
and absolute freedom...

out in the open,

surrounded by trees,
animals, and people

who were indifferent
toward me.

Grandmother: Reinaldo!

Reinaldo!

Niño, apúrate con esa agua,
Dios mío!

Mira que hay que esperar
en esta casa!

My early life was surrounded
by a room full of unhappy women

who were all bossed around
by my grandmother,

the heart of the house,

the only woman I ever saw
who peed standing up

and talked to God
at the same time.

My mother was a very beautiful
and very lonely woman.

She had only known one man,
my father,

and had enjoyed the pleasures
of love for only a few months

and then, gave that all up
for the rest of her life,

creating in her
a great sense of frustration.

Her chastity was worse
than that of a virgin.

Hijo de puta!

Vete de aquí!

Animal!

Hijo de puta!

Desgraciado!

The most extraordinary
event of my childhood

was provided by the heavens.

Water rushed down gutters,

reverberating over
the zinc roof like gunfire

a massive army marching
across the trees,

overflowing, cascading,
thundering into barrels,

a concert of drums,

water falling on water,

drenched and whistling
and out of control,

and under the spell of violence,

let loose that would sweep away
almost everything in its path.

Trees, stones,
animals, houses.

It was the mystery
of destruction.

The law of life.

As I saw it,

the currents were
roaring my name.

Flowers have
reproductive organs.

Class, can anyone
tell us what the male

reproductive organ is called?

Reinaldo?

Reinaldo?

A dick.
A long, skinny dick.

Don't ask her where
she comes from.

Can't you see she
is from the garden

and the most beautiful
flower of them all?

Buenas tardes,
con permiso.

Señor Fuentes, I didn't mean
to disturb your dinner.

What did he do?

No, he didn't do
anything wrong.

I came here to tell you that
Reinaldo has a special gift.

What special gift?

He has a sensitivity
for poetry.

After that, my grandfather
sold the farm

and moved the family
to Holguín,

opened a grocery store,

and refused to speak
to any of us.

Holguín was a town
of 200,000 people

and one garbage truck.

The rebels are in Velasco.

We can walk it in a day.

Okay.

We'll leave tonight.

'Tá bien.

You think you can
do it with her?

My name is Reinaldo.
What is yours?

Loly.

Would you like to dance?
Cómo no.

¿Qué tú quieres?
Tú eres muy niño.

( radio announcer )
Incorpórate a la lucha.

Radio Rebelde, transmitiendo
desde las montañas de Oriente,

desde la Sierra Maestra,

territorio libre de Cuba.

Aquí Radio Rebelde.

Where are you going, kid?

Up the road.
Up the road where?

Velasco.

Velasco?
You are not from Velasco.

I am from Velasco.
Why do you go to Velasco for?

Ah, the rebels
are in Velasco.

You going to join
the rebels?

Your mamá know you are
going to join the rebels?

No.

No.

Where she is?

She's in Miami, working.

Would you like to see?

It's upside down.

Qué bonita.

You want to hit things?

Sometimes I like
to hit things.

My mother, she has
a store in Velasco.

Before that it was my
grandmother's store,

and before that,
it was her mother's store.

I have six brothers.

They all want
to join the rebels.

The second one,
he joined the rebels.

I'm the middle one,
I don't join the rebels.

( car horn honking )

Get that for me.

Go home.

The rebels are no more
in Velasco.

Go on, get off.

Get off!

What?
What?

Que viva Fidel!

Viva Fidel!

Cuba libre!

Translator: Es todo por hoy.

( together )
Spaziva!

As my mother smacked me,
she cursed

and yelled, "Maldito!
Bad seed!"

She shouted at the sky,
"I want to get out of here."

But I really wasn't sure
that's what she wanted.

But now standing over me

she looked like
a huge tree trunk.

And if it didn't hurt so much,
I'd get down on my knees,

and ask her to smack me again,
even harder.

Then she became beautiful.

How pretty she is in her skirt
made out of a sack

and the blouse she stole
from her sister.

I wanted to get up and beg
her forgiveness.

I wanted to say,
"Mom, how pretty you are today.

You look like
one of those women

that you can only see
on Christmas cards,"

but I said nothing because
of the the knot in my throat.

That was very nice.
What's your name?

Reinaldo Arenas.

Who wrote this?

I did, it's my own--
from my novel.

What do you call this novel?

"Singing from the Well."

Are you a student?

Yes, I'm an agricultural
accountant.

Tell me, do you think
you'd feel at home

working in the national library?

The pay won't be very much.

But I can promise you
that you'll have all the books

you could ever hope to read.

I would like that
very much.

Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Oye, need a lift?

I want to go down
to Guayanos.

Get in.

Hello.

Driver: You like it, right?

It used to belong
to Errol Flynn.

You don't believe me?

Look in the glove
compartment.

Be careful, huh?

Do you want to go
to the movies with me?

What?

Do you want to go
to the movies with me?

I'll get out here!
Ay, coño!

You got a flat ass anyway!

Vamos, chico, vamos!

You'll see him tomorrow.

Get out!

Estúpido!

...last Saturday night
I made 100 pesos

for letting 10 members
of the National Ballet

suck me off.

Doesn't that make you a fag?

If you do it for money,
you're not a fag.

You know him?

No.

Hello.

I'm sorry about the other day.

No, don't worry.
Forget it.

I am Reinaldo.
I am Pepe.

How about some ice cream?
Yes!

Today they have only vanilla.

Bring him a banana split
with pistacho.

One ice cream!

Go.

So where you from,
Reinaldo?

I am a guajiro,
from Oriente.

Does it matter where I'm from?
No.

What do you do?

I just got a job now
in the National Library,

but I would like to be
a writer.

You poor thing.

A country boy in Havana
to serve the Revolution.

Where's your mother?
En la bodega.

Give me the key.

Chau.

Vamos!

She says it works,

just one key is a little off.

How can I thank you?

What are you doing?

Who is the man?

Who's the man?

You, because you are
the judo expert.

You don't kiss
on the lips?

Only when I'm in love.

Patricio Lamumba Beach is only
a 10 minute walk from here--

La Concha is about a mile...

This is perfect for you.

You'll have to share
the bathroom with her.

Bedsheets are changed
every two weeks

and you are responsible
for your own towel.

It is perfect, I'll take it.

Don't you want to know
how much?

It doesn't matter,
I can not afford it anyway.

30 pesos a month--

and no visitors...

nor music after 10:00pm.

30.

Thank you.

National Book Award Contest.

Hello.

I would like
to submit this please.

Put it in the box.

Hey, you want a smoke?

No, thank you.

What are you reading?

Este es "El Lazarillo
de Tormes."

Who wrote it?

No author,
he's anonymous.

No writer?
That's impossible.

No, no, no,
I didn't say no writer.

I said we don't know
who the author is.

Okay.
Do you have any other books?

Yes, I have many.

I usually read out here
so I can be alone.

I like it here.

Sorry to bother you.
I'll leave.

It's okay.
I'm going home anyway.

You live around here?

Not far.

You want to come over
and hear some music?

What?

I have some
French records.

Maybe you like...

Edith Piaf,
and Jacques Brel.

Pero estúpido idiota!

Are you out of your mind?

Take the book with you.

Ojalá se te caiga
la pinga, maricón!

Estúpido!
Coño.

And so, ladies and gentlemen,

we have arrived at this
auspicious moment.

We are happy to announce
that the first prize goes to,

"Vivir en Candonga"
by Ezequiel Vieta.

And the honorable mention
goes to Reinaldo Arenas

for "Celestino Antes de Alba."

Thank you.
Gracias.

Thank you for coming
ladies and gentlemen,

and another round of applause
for our contestants.

Congratulations.
Thank you.

You're invited to
Lezama Lima's house.

Hello.

He left after his brother
made the film "P.M."

You've heard about it.

The brother had to leave, too.

Simple film.

Just a group of people
dancing and getting drunk.

It made no judgments.

It made no judgments.

People that make art are
dangerous to any dictatorship.

They create beauty.

And beauty is the enemy.

Artists are escapists.

Artists are counter-
revolutionary,

and so you are a counter-
revolutionary, Reinaldo Arenas,

and you know why?

Because there's a man
that cannot govern

the terrain called beauty,
so he wants to eliminate it.

So, here we are, 400 years
of Cuban culture

about to become extinct
and everybody applauds.

And what happened to your lip?

I found somebody who doesn't
like French music, that's all.

Be careful.
Be careful.

No, no, no.
Keep it--

He would love for you
to have it.

There are 150 books that
contain everything

that literature has to offer.

You read them and you don't have
to read anything else.

So which book would
be the first?

"The Bible."
You have to read the Bible.

Oh, croquettes.
Ooh, María Luisa.

These croquettes don't stick
to the roof of your mouth.

They are delicious.

What kind are they?

I n this country, you don't
ask that question.

We're all being placed
on an international diet.

Let's go back
to the Bible,

it's far
more interesting.

Now, I don't mean
to convert you.

Just read it like a novel.

I tell you what, I'm going
to give you five books--

Correction, I'm going to lend
you five books.

You return them,
then I'll give you five more.

"Moby Dick," Melville,

Robert Lewis Stevenson's
"Treasure lsland,"

Proust's,
"Remembrance of Things Past"

Kafka's "Metamorphosis,"

Flaubert's,
"Sentimental Education."

María Luisa,
coffee please.

One, two, three--

four, five.

Reinaldo, I don't mean
to be presumptuous,

but we've read your book.

We both think
it's far superior

to the one
that won first prize.

They robbed you
of the first prize.

But, to be frank,

there's always room
for improvement.

If you'll allow,

Virgilio would like
to help you clean it up.

Right now it's good,

but it's too good
not to be great.

Let's fix it.

Second prize
gets published too.

That's the real prize.

We both think that
you were born to write.

( police radio )

You can't be too careful.

This is the only possession
that you really need.

...de la vida.

Las lagartijas son muy grandes
en este bañado.

Si tú las vieras!
Las lagartijas...

tienen aquí distintas formas...

Where's Pepe?

He's getting supplies.

I don't have to work today.

Let's pick up
Nicolas and Juan.

Okay.

Look, look, Tomás.
"Celestino Antes de Alba."

Now, you are really a writer.

You like that cover?
I like it, it's beautiful.

I thank Virgilio
for this book.

He gave me a lesson
in literature and editing.

...my brothers Juan
and Nicholas are writers too.

Oh, come on.

Pepe, we've got the Bronte
sisters in the back-seat.

Look at them.

Lezama is a Catholic;
Virgilio is an atheist.

So what do they
have in common

besides being faggots?

Lezama doesn't type,
he writes everything by hand.

Something you
wouldn't understand

It's called
intellectual honesty.

I don't understand!

Well, if you took the time
to actually read their books,

maybe you'd have something
intelligent to say about it.

Oye,
look at this.

Give him the cigarettes.

Oye, guapo!

Maricones!

Mariquita! ¡Mariquita!

Hazle comer
el mojón de caballo!

( gunshots )

Coño! ¿Qué es eso?

¿Qué pasa ahora?

Oye, welcome to our picnic,
compañero.

Tranquilo,
no te muevas de allí.

What do you want?
Shut up.

What do I want?

I want Carlos first
to frisk this guy.

Why him?

See if he's got a weapon.

He's not even dressed.

What's your name?

My name?

Franz Kafka.

Franz Kafka.

You're funny.

You think I'm ignorant?

Let's see how
ignorant you are.

Ever heard of a summer camp
called La Isla de la Juventud?

No, then maybe
you can tell me...

when was the last time
you took it up your ass?

The last time?

Oh, I don't remember.

You don't remember?

But, I remember
the last time you did.

When was that?

Maybe the last time
you bent over

to tie your boots?

Está bien,
lo ves, ¿no?

Está bien, está bien.

Do you have a cigarette?

Yes, I have a cigarette.

There was also a sexual
revolution going on

that came along with excitement
of the official revolution--

but the drums of militarism
were still trying to beat down

the rhythm of poetry and life.

When I wasn't at my job
at the library,

or guard duty,
or attending rallies,

there were three
wonderful things

that I enjoyed
in the 60's:

my typewriter, at which I sat
like a dedicated performer

sitting at his piano;

the youth of those days,

when everyone was ready
to break free;

and lastly, the full discovery
of the sea.

Did you ever notice there
are four categories of gays?

Really?

Really.

Which are they?

Well, the first one
is the dog collar gay--

He's loud,

shows off that
he's gay,

there's no limit
to his sexual voracity,

therefore he's constantly
being arrested.

The system has created
a permanent collar

around his neck,

so they can
hook him up

and take him to
a rehabilitation camp

like a Valparaíso.

Two is the common gay.

He's made his commitments
with other gays,

has a job, film clubs,

likes to sip tea
with his friends,

writes a poem
now and then,

only has relations
with other gays,

never takes a risk,

and never gets
to know a real man.

The third one,

the closet gay,
okay,

nobody knows
he is gay.

He's married,
has children,

hides on his way
to the bathroom,

still wearing the ring
that his wife gave him.

They're hard to spot,
but I've got one here.

Most of the time they're
the ones who censor other gays.

And fourth, the royal gay,

a unique product
of our country,

a communist country.

Because of his closeness
to our Maximum Leader

or special work with
the State Security,

he can afford
to be openly gay,

travel freely in this
country and abroad,

cover himself
with jewels, clothes...

Coño, he even has
a private chauffeur.

Hey, hey.
Stop!

Reinaldo!

Hey, Reinaldo!

Come on.
We'll give you a ride.

Where are you going?

Don't worry.
Take a seat.

Hello.

How are you?

Now, we're going to take
a little shortcut

and show you a beautiful
part of Havana

that not many
visitors get to see.

The crackdown began in earnest.

The horror and ugliness
advanced day by day

at an ever increasing pace,

but the oppression only
acted as a stimulus

and sex became a way
of fighting it...

a weapon to use
against the regimen.

Needless to say,

the Revolution wasn't
for everybody.

Mr. Heberto Zorrilla Ochoa,

are you aware of Article 243
in the Penal Code?

Yes.

And what does Article 243
of the Penal Code state?

It states that no assembly
of over three people is allowed.

And yet, you had an assembly
of over 20 people at your home

on the night of July 10th.

What were you doing?

It was a poetry reading.

Whose poetry?

My own--
others.

And are you sure that
this was a poetry reading

and not just an
opportunity to recite

counterrevolutionary
propaganda?

Yes, I'm sure.

Mr. Correa, is poetry
ever propaganda?

I suppose it could be.

But not your poetry.

No.

Mr. Correa, who else
was present

at this so-called
poetry reading?

Some friends,
other writers.

Tell me, does the name
José Lezama Lima ring a bell?

Virgilio Piñera?

Your wife, Fina?

Yes.

Were they there?

Yes, they were there.

Are you aware
that Lezama Lima

and Virgilio Piñera
are homosexuals?

Yes.

I am aware of my errors.

that are unpardonable,

errors that demand
to be severely punished.

But I must confess
that I see before me

in this room,

the faces of many comrades
who like me,

have lost their way,

whose ideology has waivered,

who have committed
similar errors...

errors that also demand
to be severely punished.

( crowd screams )

I'm sorry.
I'm late.

We got a call about
an hour ago.

They said they would be
at the Hotel Nacional

and they're leaving
today at 4:00 p.m.

That's all they said?

They're friends of
Lezama Lima.

Reinaldo?
Yes.

I'm Jorge Camacho.

This is my wife, Margarita.
Hi.

Have a seat.

We live in Paris.

Jorge is in a show
at the Salón De Mayo.

He's a painter.

We are big fans
of your work.

My work?

We bought your book
in a bookstore

and Jorge stayed up
all night reading it.

He said it was
the greatest novel

he ever read
about childhood.

Would you put
the book away, please.

Yes, of course.

Of course.

Reinaldo!

Margarita went ahead.

I thought you
were gone.

I went to the hotel--
I didn't know.

But, I knew you
were here.

This is a friend
of ours,

who works at
the French Embassy.

If you ever
need anything

you can give
her a call.

She'll get in
touch with us.

It's a small present
from Margarita and me.

Thank you
very much, Jorge.

You have to go.

What do your
paintings look like?

Because I didn't
ask you before.

You'll have to
see them in person.

Sure.

Who knows?

Maybe you could
write something

about them someday.

Hey Mister,
can I have my kite, please?

Get lost.

You almost killed me.

Come on,
give him the kite.

You want to give
him the kite?

Give him the kite?

Forget it!

Come on,
give him the kite!

Oye!

You want to give
him back the kite?

Okay, I'll give
him the kite.

What are you doing, Pepe?

What are you doing, Pepe?

Get out of here!

Aléjate de aquí!
iBruto!

Here.

Excuse me.
Excuse me.

I was on the beach
and these boys

stole my flippers
and my clothes.

Could you identify them?

No, but it's okay.

Get in the car.

No, it's okay.

Get in the car.

Ahí están!
That's them!

Come over here.

You have something
belonging to this man?

Look at him.

Give me your ID cards.

I was going to return this
stuff to the police station.

That faggot and his friend,
tried to touch our pricks.

Yeah, we beat them up
and they ran off,

so, we were going to bring
this to the station.

They molested us.

They molested you?
Yeah.

You're sure?
Yes.

You're under arrest.

Why!

Because I said so.

Lugando Barnes!

What are you doing here?

I live right over here.

I need a towel, t-shirt,
anything you have.

Please.

Thank you.

I need a place to hide.

I don't know,
I have to get out of here.

Why, what did you do?

They said I
molested these kids.

You should see these kids.

They were all bigger
than me.

Have you heard from Tomás?

I was told that he was
in a work camp in Oriente

and he was killed
while trying to escape.

I've heard you've
had some trouble

with the police.

No, it was a mistake,

they had me mixed up
with somebody else.

The way I see it,
you have two choices:

You can try to make it
to the U .S. Navy Base

in Guantánamo;

or you can try to float
your way to Florida.

It's about 90 miles.

You can make it in a few
days if the current is good.

I have an inner tube
I was saving.

It's yours.

( knocking on door )

Who is it?

It's me, Pepe.

I'm sorry about today.

What do you want now?

Where are you going?

I don't know.

H uh, where have you been?

I'm leaving right now.

How?

How?
Inner tube.

You're crazy,
you're going to drown.

Listen, do you want
to help me?

Yes, I want to help you.

Then give me all the
money you have on you.

You can have
the gold, clothes...

you can sell
it everywhere.

Please, give me all
the money you have on you.

You have money in here?

Give me the money.
Give me the money!

You can take--

you can take everything,

You can stay here
if you want.

Reinaldo, I have
some friends

that can solve
this problem.

What kind of friends
do you have?

You know what
kind of friends.

Why kind of friends
do you have?

Don't go away.

Reinaldo.
I'm leaving.

I'm leaving...

I-I'll keep in touch
with you, alright?

Bye.

Reinaldo--

I have to hide
you somewhere,

because we are
surrounded by police.

...a photo of you

just in case you forget
what you look like,

and last,
"La lliada."

"La llíada," Juan,
"La llíada."

Here are the pills
you asked for.

What are they?

I don't know,
but they make you happy.

Will they kill me?

I suppose if you
took enough of them.

Hello.

Hello.

Can I have two
croquetas, please?

Two?

Yes, and a drink.

Do you have a light?

Yes.
Sure.

Do you have
a cigarette?

What is your name?

Adriano Faustino Sotolongo.

When did you get
that name, Reinaldo?

You are Reinaldo Arenas,
aren't you?

Buen trabajo.

Officer: Mira, encontramos
este paquete.

Este es Reinaldo Arenas,

un pájaro que agarramos
ahí en el parque.

Dale! Dale!

Dale, coño!
Dale!

Ya vas a ver
lo que es bueno.

Vas a ver lo que es bueno
ahí adentro.

I arrived at El Morro not
as a political prisoner

or writer,

but with an infamous
reputation as a rapist,

a murderer,
and a CIA agent.

a supernatural air
of nonchalance

and gave me an aura
of danger and respectability

among the real murderers,

real rapists,

and common criminals
who would kill each other

for the slightest reason.

Skies lit by bolts
of lightning

were replaced
by electric lights

that blinked on and off
with regularity,

killing the possibility
or chance that I might dream

or forget where I was.

I thought here
I could go unnoticed.

But prisoners are those
beings that know everything,

especially about
other prisoners.

Soon they knew,
maybe from the guards,

or the warden himself,
or a killer named Torre,

that I was a writer.

Say, you think you could
write a letter for me?

What?

Not for nothing,

I give you two cigarettes.

Carlota--

tell her that I miss
her so much.

Your words or mine?

I'm sorry.

My fame as "The Writer"
spread all over the prison.

María...

From the 17 cells of El Morro,

and for those who couldn't
see me directly,

petitions came in the form
of hundreds of balls of soap,

tied to long strings,

that the prisoners
could pass on to my cell.

It was called "The Mail."

I never wrote so much.

I accumulated a small
fortune of cigarettes

that provided me with
enough paper and pencils

for my own novel,

which I wrote in the middle,

of all the screaming
and crying.

Cubans are defined by noise,
it's their nature.

They need to bother others.

They can neither enjoy,
nor suffer in silence.
