("A World Without Love"
by Peter and Gordon playing)

â™ª Please lock me away â™ª

â™ª And don't allow the day â™ª

â™ª Here inside where I hide â™ª

â™ª With my loneliness â™ª

â™ª I don't care what they say â™ª

â™ª I won't stay
in a world without love â™ª


â™ª Birds sing out of tune â™ª
(humming along)

â™ª And rain clouds
hide the moon â™ª

(sighs, whispers): Me?
â™ª I'm okay â™ª

â™ª Here I'll stay â™ª

â™ª With my loneliness â™ª

â™ª I don't care what they say â™ª

â™ª I won't stay â™ª

â™ª In a world without love â™ª

â™ª So I wait â™ª
(humming along)

â™ª And in a while â™ª

â™ª I will see
my true love smile â™ª

â™ª She may come,
I know not when â™ª

(gasps, scoffs)
â™ª When she does, I'll know â™ª

â™ª So, baby, until then â™ª

â™ª Lock me away â™ª
(continues humming)

â™ª And don't allow... â™ª

Beautiful gown, darling.

â™ª Here inside... â™ª

Thank you.

â™ª With my loneliness â™ª

Fabulous.

â™ª I don't care what they say â™ª
(humming along)

â™ª I won't stay
in a world without love â™ª

Who are you wearing?

Eloise Turner.

Who are you wearing?

Eloise T, of course.

E.T.

(blows raspberry)

Ellie Turner.

(chuckles)
â™ª So I wait... â™ª

(record scratches)
(gasps, scoffs)

(record skipping):
â™ª I know not when they come â™ª

â™ª I know not
when they come â™ª

â™ª I know not when they come â™ª

â™ª I know not
when they come â™ª

â™ª I know not when they come... â™ª

It's good news, isn't it?

PEGGY (in distance):
Eloise, post!

â™ª I know not when they come... â™ª

PEGGY: Ellie?
Coming!

(breath trembling)

Well, what does it say?

I'm going to London.

I knew you would be.

I'm going to London!

I'm going to London.

I'm going to London.
I'm going to London.

I'm going to London.
(Peggy chuckling)

("Wishin' and Hopin'"
by Dusty Springfield playing)

â™ª Wishin' and hopin'
and thinkin'... â™ª

ELOISE: You sure
I can take all of these?

PEGGY:
I got you hooked on them.

I can't deprive you now.

Do you have enough space?

ELOISE:
Hmm?

Don't you need socks?


This was one of the first times
your mum and me went to London.

God, the shops.

We used to look
at all the clothes.

Liberty. Selfridges.

Carnaby Street.

The snooty shopgirls knew
we couldn't afford anything,

but they didn't know
we could copy it.

Take it.

No, I can't, Gran.

Bring her up when I'm settled.

We'll have dinner at the
Criterion, like in the photo.

We didn't eat there.
Couldn't afford to.

Just took a picture outside
and went to a Wimpy.

When I'm a big-time
fashion designer, we'll go.

Deal?

I don't think Wimpy still exist.


I know how much you want this.

It was her dream, too,

but it's not
what you imagine, London.

Gran.

You've got to look out
for yourself.

I know.
But I'm gonna say it anyway.

There are lots of bad guys.
You've got to be careful.

There's lots of bad people.
I'll be careful.

They're bad apples.

I'm scrappy. I can take 'em.

I'm just saying,
London can be a lot.

It was too much
for your mum, perhaps,

and she didn't have your gift.

My gift?

She didn't feel things,
see things like you do.

I... I worry you'll get
all overwhelmed again.

Gran, it's... it's not just
that I need to do this for me.

I really want to, for her.

And maybe it won't be so bad.

Maybe up there, I won't be
reminded of her so much.

Okay.

Besides...

I haven't even seen Mum in ages.

(alarm beeping)

Bye.

PEGGY:
You'll call?

ELOISE:
You know I will.

PEGGY: And if it all gets
too much in there,

you'll tell me?

In the city?

In here.

Please don't do that
to yourself.

Don't do it to me, okay?

I love you.

Oh, Ellie.

I want us both to be there.

I won't let you guys down.

You never could.

â™ª No, no, no, no â™ª

â™ª Don't throw your love away â™ª

â™ª For you might need it â™ª

â™ª Someday â™ª

â™ª Don't throw your dreams away â™ª

â™ª Don't throw your love away. â™ª

Charlotte Street, please.
My pleasure, darling.

DRIVER:
<i>First time?</i>

ELOISE: <i>I visited once
with my mum, but I was small.</i>

It looks so different now.
It changes fast, all right.

But don't you worry, love.

It's still the same old London
underneath.

Good.

DRIVER:
What brings you down, then?

ELOISE:
I'm studying.

London College of Fashion.

So, you're a model?

No.

I design clothes.

Well, I want to. I mean...

I want to be a designer.

Yeah, but you could be
a model, couldn't you?

You got the legs for it.

(driver chuckling)

DRIVER: <i>So, what's in
Charlotte Street, then?</i>

Uh, student housing.

It's all girls in that building?

If all you supermodels are
gonna be in Charlotte Street,

you'll see plenty of me,
don't you worry.

You might have found
your first stalker.

I'll get out here.

Oh, no, it's a couple
more streets, love.

No, I haven't got enough cash.

Oh, I'm sure we could sort
something out, sweetheart.

Plus, it's not good
round here at night

for young girls on their own.

I want to go to the shop anyway.

Please yourself.

(brakes squeak,
gearshift clicks)

(indistinct chatter)

(entry bell chimes)

SHOP OWNER:
Excuse me.

Can I help you?

Uh, sorry.

(cash register dings)

(entry bell chimes)

Hey, do you want a hand?

Fine.

You don't look fine.

Well, I am.

Are you Eloise?
Yeah.

Yeah, you-you look
like an Eloise.

Well, Ellie.

I'm Jocasta.

Did they spell your surname
wrong or something?

Oh, no, I've just decided
to drop it because I feel like

it's way more singular
to be known

by just your Christian name.

You know, like,
so famous in your work

that you can actually
just go by Kylie.

Minogue?
Jenner.

Oh.

Okay, bad example, but...
how many Jocastas do you know?

None.

Exactly, babes.

You don't mind I snagged
the bed by the window, do you?

No.
If we don't end up throttling each other,

we could maybe talk about
switching next term.

Yeah.

So, where are you from?
Uh, Redruth.

It's in Cornwall.

I'm sorry.

You know, Cornwall,
in the countryside.

No, no, I-I heard you, babes.

I'm just, I'm sorry.

Uh...

what about you?

Manchester originally,
but I, uh,

moved down here in my gap year.

Uh, I had an internship
at an atelier in Savile Row.

Oh, wow. I've just been in
Redruth making my own clothes.

I had a hunch you made that.

Yeah, this is Bouchra Jarrar.

Before she sold out
and moved to Lanvin, obviously.

Smoke?
No.

Is it allowed in here?

Oh, I-I just took
the batteries out of the alarm.

I can go outside if you really
have a problem with it.

No.

No, it's fine.
I tried vaping.

I just think it makes you look
like so much more of a cunt.

Yeah, totally.

So, what does your dad do?

Uh, I don't know him.

Oh, tell me about it.

And your mum?
My mother's dead.

Well, I knew we'd find
some common ground eventually.

Yeah, I was only 15
when she died.

What about you?

Seven.

Oh, wow, that is young.

Although I guess
it's maybe easier at that age.

Not that it's a competition,
though, is it? (chuckles)

(distant door opens)
(chatter in hall)

Ooh, fresh blood!

(door opens)

Oh, my God, wow, is that
a bloody Bouchra Jarrar?

Oh, good eye.

Yeah, well, before she sold out
and moved to Lanvin, obviously.

Yeah.
Obviously. (chuckles)

Oh.

Oh, this is my roomie, Eloise.

OTHERS:
Hi.

Yeah, she literally made
the outfit she's wearing.

How amazing. All of us
turn up in our Sunday best,

and she's here
rocking her own design.


I'm thinking we should call her
Brass Balls Ellie.

ASHLEY:
And what will we call you?

Oh, well, by tomorrow morning,

you'll know me only
as Hurricane Jocasta.

Ooh. So you guys know
each other from before?

Oh, yeah, we go way back.

What is it, like 15 minutes?
(chuckles)

Yeah, something like that.

JOCASTA:
We're in the Dead Mums Club.

LARA: Oh.
Fuck leukemia, am I right?

That's awful.
JOCASTA: Yeah.

It's pretty shit.
I'm not gonna lie.

But, I don't know, I feel like
it kind of fuels my work.

So...
Mm-hmm.

What happened to your mum?

Uh, she wasn't well... mentally.

She... she killed herself.

ASHLEY:

We shouldn't have asked.

It was a long time ago.

You're, like, so brave.
So brave.

Yeah, I had a-a great-uncle
commit suicide... hung himself.

ASHLEY:
Oh, God.

So, yeah, I know exactly
what it's like.

ASHLEY:
Also so brave.

LARA: So brave also.
CAMI: Yeah.

JOCASTA:
Mm.

JOCASTA:
First rodeo, Ellie?

Got to mark
your territory, babes.

Ooh.
Oh.

Time to break out the big guns.
(laughter)

Let's really get on this bitch.

CAMI: Do we really want to be
hungover on our first day?

JOCASTA: Oh, hush.
That's future you talking.

You know what, fuck her.
(laughter)

You've got to live
in the now, girls.

So, hos...
(others chuckling)

...to Soho.

OTHERS:
To Soho.

To Soho.

(others whooping)

Come on, Ellie. Keep up.

â™ª â™ª
(car horns honking)

You're gonna love it!
(laughing)

(excited chatter)

Let's go!

I dated an Irish guy twice.
(laughter)

Well, like, the-the same guy
but, like, two separate times.

Oh.
Yeah. Yeah.

And, yeah, he was Irish.

Yeah, and, I don't know,
I kind of feel like

I kind of get the culture.

MAN:
Watch and learn, guys.

And I just love Ireland.

Like, he literally
introduced me...

Um, excuse me, miss.

Um, my dick just died.

Can I bury it in your arse?

Ew, absolutely not.
(groans) Get away.

That's disgusting.

Oh, you should try
that line on Eloise.

I bet she's complete filth

once you get a few drinks
inside her.

MAN: Okay. Okay.
(others laughing)

What?

Oh, come on, play the game.
Aw. - Ellie.

(quiet chatter)

Freshers...
they're a blessing and a curse.

(takes deep breath)

I'm just like...

She's such a code beige,
I'm getting these, like,

born-again Christian vibes
off her.

Who, Country Mouse?

She comes to
her first day at LCF

wearing clothes
she fucking made.

ASHLEY:
Yeah, that was a bit much.

JOCASTA: Bringing up
her mum's suicide... I'm sorry,

but, like, who the fuck
does that for attention?

LARA: Yeah, right.
ASHLEY: She's a bit weird.

JOCASTA:
She's a lot fucking weird.

I'd lay bets on her

slashing her wrists
before Christmas.

(gasping, laughter)
(snorting)

LARA:
You can't say that.

JOCASTA: It's true.
ASHLEY: Jocasta!

JOCASTA: Come on. We've got
another three pubs to hit

before the clubs open.

Anyway, you still

It's great.

Is she nice?

Yeah, yeah, she's fun.
How lovely.

I say pub crawl, round two.

Almost too much fun.

Well, that's wonderful.

I-I thought maybe

Oh, yes.

Don't take smokers.

I don't smoke.

No male visitors after 8:00.

Not a problem.

And no using
the laundry room at night.

It rattles
right through to mine.

I don't do laundry.
Eh?

I mean...
I don't do nighttime laundry.

I do do laundry. I'm very clean.

you can find somewhere else.

Bed, kitchenette, bathroom.

You won't have to worry
about it until the summer,

but then you'll have to
keep the plugs in

'cause all the smells rise up.

How long have you lived here?

Oh, a long while.

I used to work here,
cleaning and such,

back when round here
was a bad spot.

I bought it for buttons
off the old owner.

Must be worth a lot now.

Oh, I could never sell it.

Too many memories.

Yeah.

I'd live here in London

As soon as possible.

You're not in any trouble,

No.

No, I just need, uh, an escape.

Oh, don't we all, deary.

What's your line of work?

I'm a student, but I have
a loan and a bursary.

Well, what do you study?

Fashion.

Ah. Interesting.

Yeah. My gran's a seamstress,

and my mum is...
was in the industry, too.

And you're sure you'll be able
to make the rent?

Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'll make it work.

I do ask more

I want two months rent

ANNOUNCER:
Once again, Miss Cilla Black.

Hello.
You're a gorgeous creature.

What's your name?
Sandie.

Care to join
my friends and I, Sandie?

Thanks, but I'm here
to meet the owner.

I am the owner.

Oh, I doubt that.

I'm whatever
you want me to be, Sandie.

What's your poison, miss?

I'm not here to drink, actually.

I want to speak to the owner.

Owner's not in tonight.

What do you want
to speak to them about?

I want to be
your new headline act.

Where have you played before?
Nowhere.

Who starts at the Cafe de Paris?

Me.

I can take your name
if you want,

but maybe you should speak
to Jack in the meantime.

Jack?

Over there.

The guy standing
next to Cilla Black.

Brilliant, Cilla.
Honestly, what a performance.

He manages a lot of girls.

Well, hello there.

The bartender said
I should get to know

the handsome fella
standing next to Cilla Black.

You should.

And you are?

The next Cilla Black.

Are you, now?

Well, you know, she started out
as a coat check girl.

You willing to work your way up?

Of course.

What can I get you to drink?

It's Sandie,
and I'd love a Vesper.

James, we'd love a Vesper.

So, what do you do, Sandie?

Well, I sing, of course.

How's your dancing?

Care for a demonstration?

You're already a star.

But you could be an old lady
before you get onstage here.

How about I get you a gig
somewhere this week?

You could do that?
I could, indeed.

But first,
let me get your Vesper.

Do I get a dance now?
Afraid not.

Oh, you looked up for it
just then.

I'm just waiting for my friend
Jack to get my drink.

Well, I'm sure Jack won't mind.
I mind.

Now, don't pretend
you don't love the attention.

Is this man bothering you?

I was just asking
our friend Sandie for a dance.

Her card is full right now.

That's all right, old chap.

Don't hog her all night.

You're the only hog
round here, old chap.

Now, don't be a cunt about it.

You can keep your little whore.

The design.
Thanks.

Oh, and, uh...

Ah, you didn't have to.

It's the least I could do.

What's the most?


Uh, I don't know
why I said that.

I thought it'd sound cool.
Yeah.

Do you have any plans tonight?

Yeah, I kind of do, actually.

â™ª Just listen to the music

I can't fucking believe it.

I can.

SANDIE: Can't wait
to get back in there.

It's no Cafe de Paris.

It's perfect, Jack. Thank you.

Well, like I said,
least I can do.

Much better than being
a coat check girl.

And we all have to
start somewhere.

Indeed, we do.

Do you think
I should get a stage name?

What's Sandie short for?
Alexandra.

Nah, stick with Sandie.
Suits you.

Could do with some new outfits.

Oh, yeah?

Anything else you need?

A manager.

Know anyone?

I think I can manage you.

SANDIE (distorted, echoing):
Just as long as

you're in it for the long run.

Just as long as you're in it

Just as long as
you're in it for the long run.

Don't you like it?

I like it if you like it.
Yeah, I love it.

I'm just glad you're finding
yourself in London, Eloise.

Gran, it's everything
I ever dreamed of.

MS. TOBIN: It's ambitious...
I'll give you that...

but I'm not sure this
vintage fabric will behave.

I think it's gonna be tricky
to work with.

Oh.

I know this is exactly
what it needs.

It needs something radiant
but not too structured.

Okay. Go on.

Well...

It needs to flow.

I like how it drapes on her arms

and gathers at her sides.
Her?

So, you imagine the wearer
when you're designing?

When I see someone in it,
when-when I imagine it,

sh-she's wearing the dress.

The dress isn't wearing her.

I hope you were all
listening to that.

Something about the '60s?
(quiet laughter)

MS. TOBIN:
It's excellent, Ellie.

And I like your hair.
Thanks.

(makes choking sound)

(quiet laughter)

(bell jingles)
Wow.

Yeah, it really suits you.

Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

Everything was
so well made back then.

We have a Biba dress

1967, immaculate condition.

You should try that one, too.

Yeah.

Well, I was hoping a job.

Take a seat. You want a drink?

Uh, yeah.

Could I get a Vesper?

This isn't Mayfair, darling.

Have you ever even worked

No.

But we all have to

I'm not worried.

You look familiar to me.

Who's your mother?

My mother's dead.

I thought she might be.

Most of 'em are.

DRIVER: Jesus Christ.

Can I help you?

It's me, Ellie.

So it is.

Look at that.

You've changed your hair.
Yeah.

I wanted to go
for something different...

you know, a bit '60s.

You play a lot
of that music, don't you?

Is it too loud?

Not at all,
but what's that about?

It's more my time than yours.

My gran plays it a lot.

Guess I just like the old songs
better than the stuff today.

Music was better, yeah.

Just us.

I'm with Jack.

Oh, Jack doesn't mind.
Do you, Jack?

Not one bit.

Sandie.

Sorry, sir.

Sandie, get back here. Sandie.

Jack, I don't want to do this.
You told me you were serious

about being a performer, so if
you want to keep doing it,

then these are the kind of men
that you need to keep happy.

The men you really need to perform for.
No, Jack.

Everybody else is doing it.
What makes you so special?

Oi!
She said no!

We all have to start somewhere.

Sandie!

Eh?
Wake up.

JACK: You were the one

Hi.
Hey.

What do you want?

Well, I heard you work here now,

so I thought,

kill two birds with one stone.

Just because you seemed
a little upset in class today.

And I thought maybe
I could swing by,

see how you were getting on.

Thanks.

I meant,
what do you want to drink?

Oh, yeah.

Three Kronenbourgs, please.
Sure.

JOHN:
Heard you got a new place.

ELOISE:
Yeah. I'm in a bedsit.

That's good, right?

It's really something else.

It must be great

Must be.

Why? What's up?

Nothing.

I'm just a bit overwhelmed
at the moment.

London can be a lot.

I get it.

Coming to the city can be
a bit of a nightmare.

Honestly, I'd be lying if I said

I had the best time
in North London so far.

Where'd you move from?

South London.

I'm gonna get these to my mates.

But...

...I know what it's like
to feel like you don't belong.

And I'm a good listener,
if you ever want to talk.

They're meant to talk to you
about their problems,

not the other way round.
Mm.

Everything's great, Gran.

Uh, no one.

We?

Yeah, Hurricane Jocasta.

Everyone, really.
The whole class.

Something's wrong.
No. (chuckles)

Ellie, I can hear it
in your voice.

Gran, I really am at the pub.

I'm working here.

Working there? Why?

I moved out the halls.
Oh, no. What...

I needed to get
a place of my own.

Did-did something happen?

Did you see her again?
No.

No, Mum's not here with me.

Then what is it?

What's wrong?

Please tell me.

Look, I should go back in.

I know you think you have
something to prove,

but it's okay to ask for help.

She didn't.

Gran, I have to go.

I love you.
Love you, too.

Everything all right, Ellie?

Or do I call you Eloise,

like the old song?

I don't know that song.

And how do you know my name?

I make it my business to know

all the pretty girls
around here.

All their problems.

Always have done.

You smoke, don't you, love?

No.

Oh, must be thinking
of some other blonde.

Anyway...

...be well.

(gasps softly)

Was Handsy bothering you?

Handsy?

Yeah.

The man's like an octopus.

Carol says he was a right
ladies' man back in the day.

Probably thinks
he has a shot with you.

ELOISE:
<i>Do you believe in spirits?</i>

CAROL: What kind
of a question is that?

That brown stuff
pays your wages.

I mean...

do you believe in ghosts?

Ghosts? No.

Why?

Are you scared down here?

If this place is haunted by
anything, it's the good times.

When it's empty,
all I hear is the laughs.

Every gangster, every copper,

every red-faced lush
has been in here,

and all those high spirits
have soaked into the walls.

You could probably
get drunk on just that.

Yeah.

Ellie, I love you, girl.

You fit right in.

("Always Something There
to Remind Me" by Sandie Shaw)

Good morning, Ellie.

Oh, something happened
last night. (chuckles)

â™ª I walk along
the city streets â™ª

â™ª You used to walk along
with me... â™ª

How's that?

Um, do you think
it's a bit long?

Yeah.

â™ª Oh, how can I forget you â™ª

â™ª When there is always
something there to remind me? â™ª

You know where to find me.

Eloise, what's wrong?

Ellie, are you okay?

JOCASTA: What the fuck
is wrong with her?

JOHN: Ellie.
(gasps)

Talk to me.

Talk to me.

(gasping, whimpering)

â™ª You'll always be
a part of me â™ª

Ellie! Ellie!

Ellie!

â™ª When shadows fall,
I pass the small cafÃ© â™ª

â™ª Where we would dance
at night â™ª

â™ª And I can't help recalling â™ª

â™ª How it felt to kiss
and hold you tight â™ª

â™ª Well, how can I forget you â™ª

â™ª When there is always
something there to remind me? â™ª

â™ª Always something there
to remind me â™ª

â™ª I was born to love you â™ª

â™ª And I will never be free â™ª

â™ª You'll always be
a part of me â™ª

â™ª Oh, whoa-whoa-whoa â™ª

â™ª Whoa, whoa, oh... â™ª

(song fades)
(panting)

â™ª â™ª

(voices whispering):
Where you going?

Where you going?

Where you going?

Watch where you're going, girl.

JACK:
<i>These are the kind of men</i>

<i>that you need to keep happy.</i>
(siren wailing nearby)

MAN: <i>Then maybe
it's too late for you.</i>

JACK:
<i>Don't you ever disrespect me!</i>

MAN:
<i>I'm talking to you, blondie.</i>

MS. COLLINS:
<i>This is London.</i>

MAN (echoing):
<i>You look familiar to me.</i>

MS. COLLINS (echoing):
<i>Did he hurt you?</i>

DETECTIVE:
Just so I've got this straight,

you-you witnessed
the murder last night,

but you believe this was
a vision from the past,

the murder of a young woman
in the mid to late 1960s

by a man you believe
to be her pimp.

Yeah.

You're an art student, correct?

Uh, fashion.

Have you ever taken
any hallucinogens?

Acid, mushrooms, mescaline?

We're not gonna get you
into trouble if you have.

Yeah, I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm not on drugs.

I don't take anything.

You were at a party before.

Could somebody have
slipped you something?

Maybe somebody
bought you a drink?

Get these down you.

Uh, no.

No, it-it... it started
before last night.

When I was sober,
I saw landmarks in my dreams,

details of nightclubs,

<i>places that
I'd never been to before,</i>

<i>and then I saw those details
in real life.</i>

I know something bad happened
to this girl,

'cause I have these visions,
these visions of the past.

Ever since I moved to London,
I keep seeing Sandie.

Th-That's the murdered girl.

Have you only been here
a short time?

A few weeks.

London, well, it can be a lot.

Maybe it would help
if you spoke to someone.

Look, please just listen to me!

Is there a history
of s-schizophrenia

or mental health issues
in your family?

I know who the killer is.

It's her boyfriend,
uh, and her pimp, Jack.

I've seen him
in the present day.

Look, there's this man
I've seen around Soho

<i>who follows me.</i>

<i>The first time I saw him</i>

<i>outside one of
those models places,</i>

<i>he didn't take
much notice of me,</i>

<i>but he did suddenly take notice</i>

<i>when I changed my hair
to the same style</i>

<i>as Sandie's, the murdered girl.</i>

What, this hairdo?

Look... look, my point is
I've seen Jack.

I've seen the killer
as an old man around Soho.

Can you narrow down
"around Soho"?

He drinks at The Toucan.

I think we've got all we need.

(papers shuffling)
<i>(door bangs open)</i>


(toilet flushes)

DETECTIVE:
And then she says the...

the killer drinks at The Toucan
and-and narrows it down

to me, you
and the whole rest of Soho.

(men laughing)

DETECTIVE: Yeah,
I'm sitting there thinking,

"This is complete bullshit,
darling."

Miss Turner.

Miss Turner, don't go.

I'd really like you
to stick around.

What do I need to do
to convince you I'm not crazy?

I don't think you are.

I just think you need
a bit of help to settle in.

A-A support system.

You've done the right thing.

Please hear that, okay?

And I will look into
Sandie's murder,

and I've got
your contact details,

so if anything comes up,
I'll be in touch.

Thank you.

Though I will say,
in such cases,

especially this old,
it's hard when you don't have

something concrete to go on...

even a last name.

â™ª â™ª

I want to look up murdered
women, uh, missing persons

in the Central London area
from 1960 to 1969.

Aren't you a fashion student?

Yeah. Yeah, it's research.

You're doing some
cool fashion shoots

based on infamous murder sites
or something?

Yeah.

Yeah, that's exactly right.

Killer.
It is.

â™ª â™ª

JOHN (quietly):
Hey, Ellie, I got your...

Jesus, John!

Why whisper like that?

It's a library.

Right.

I have your stuff.

You ran out.

Uh, left your bag.

Everyone's here,

cramming for the test.

Listen, about last night.

I mean, if I did
something wrong...

No, you didn't.

Sorry, it's not about you.

Then... what is it, El?

You'll think I sound crazy.

Talk to me.

Last night, I saw something.

In the bedroom, from the past.

What did you see?

A girl was stabbed.

There's a girl
that used to live in my room...

<i>Sandie.</i>

<i>The guy that killed her
is still out there.</i>

So I'm looking
for murdered women

and missing persons
from the '60s

to try and find out her name.

And if I don't,
I'm gonna lose my mind.

Maybe I already have.

Feel free to run a mile now.

Listen.

My auntie believes in
all sorts of weird shit.

So you just tell me
how I can help.

Well, I guess you can start
with the next year of boxes:

1966.

Damn. This is just one year?

London's a bad place.

CAMI (whispers):
Did you see that?

Ashley, she could have
fucking killed her.

It's okay.

It's okay.

It's not fucking okay.

What the actual fuck?!

Security!

Stay here.

Jocasta! Jocasta, wait!

JOCASTA:
Security!

JOHN:
Stop!

Jocasta, it was an accident.

JOCASTA: An accident?
Are you fucking kidding me?

You think you can just

(distorted voices overlapping)

â™ª â™ª



Leave me alone!

â™ª â™ª

Hey, come back here, you slut!

Get back here, whore!

I'm talking to you, Sandie!

Leave me alone!

Jack?

Jack! Jack!

Jack!

Where the hell have you been?

I've been covering you
downstairs

for the last hour,
for fuck's sake.

Ellie, get down
in that basement, girl.

You've got a customer.

("Eloise" by Barry Ryan
playing on jukebox)

MAN (to rhythm of song):
â™ª Bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum â™ª

(on jukebox):
â™ª Every night, I'm there â™ª

â™ª I'm always there â™ª

â™ª She knows I'm there â™ª

â™ª And heaven knows â™ª

MAN:
â™ª Bum â™ª

(on jukebox):
â™ª I hope she goes â™ª

MAN:
â™ª Bum, bum â™ª

MAN: â™ª Eloise â™ª
(jukebox): â™ª I find it hard â™ª

â™ª To realize that love was in her eyes â™ª
(man hums along)

â™ª It's dying now â™ª

â™ª She knows I'm crying now... â™ª

And here she is.

You know your siren song
is playing?

I just put this on the jukebox,

and lo and behold, you appear.

Carol was worried about you.

Thought you'd gone missing.

I told her no one ever
really disappears.

They're always around somewhere.

I'm right here.
Aren't you just?

I'll have a pint
of Numbers, love.

I hear you were quite the ladies' man.
Were?

How dare you?

Still am.

You never lose it.

You knew a lot
of the girls round here?

A lot of 'em?

I knew all of 'em.

Sandie?

Who didn't know Sandie?

(singing along to jukebox):
â™ª My Eloise-a â™ª

â™ª I'd love to please her â™ª

â™ª I'd love to care â™ª

â™ª But she's not there â™ª

(whimpers softly)

Do I scare you?

No.

I knew all the girls.

Like to think
I looked after 'em.

Had to keep them
in order, too, mind.

Keep 'em in line.

Sandie, she was special, though.

She didn't belong.

I thought she was
too good for it.

But, you know,
at the end of the day,

you all look the same on a slab.

I know what you did.

I've done a lot of things,
Eloise.

You're gonna have to be
more specific, love.

I know what you did to Sandie.

Do you, now?
Mm.

Yeah, I saw her.

I see her.

I know what happened.

Well, whatever happened
to Sandie,

she brought it on herself.

But no one deserves that.

Listen.

I know where you live, Eloise.

And I don't know
what you've seen or heard,

but I can tell you
Sandie ended up

exactly where she wanted to be.

Funny you mention her, though,

because the first thing I did

when I dragged myself back
to this miserable smoke

was to look up her old bones.

But turns out some people
don't want to be found.

But you killed her.

You think I killed Sandie?

I know you did!
(glass shatters)

Ha! I think you'll find
Alex killed Sandie.

Come back.

Nah. I've had enough
of this line of questioning.

You think she was an angel,

but don't be fooled.

I'm recording this.

You won't get away with it!

So what?
I do what I like in this manor.

The police know! I told them!

Like I give a flying fuck.

Look, wait!

When you see Alex

in whatever little hell
she's currently in,

you tell her I said hello.

(tires screech)
(Eloise gasps)

(onlookers gasping, murmuring)


Oh, my good God.

BARTENDER:
Jesus.

(Eloise sobbing)

What happened?
DRIVER: He just stopped

in-in the middle of the street.

Oh, Lindsey, you poor bastard.

Call an ambulance, pet.

Now!

And tell 'em
he used to be police.

That'll make them hurry.
Right. Okay.

Lindsey?

He's police?
Yeah, he's ex-vice.

He used to be a copper in Soho
for years and years,

working the red light district,
and now look at him.

Then his name's not Jack?

Jack?

No, love.

That's Lindsey.

(whimpering, panting)

BARTENDER:
Yeah, he looks very bad.

I reckon you're a copper
or something.

you're a copper or something.</i>

Do you, now?

<i>Do you, now?</i>

while you can, girl.</i>

CAROL:
Ellie?

Ellie!

(siren blaring)

ELOISE (sobbing):
<i>I've let you down.</i>

<i>I've let Mum down.</i>

PEGGY (over phone):
You haven't let anyone down.

You never could.
Okay.

Ellie, I don't know
what's happened,

but it's okay to come home.

You haven't failed anyone.


I'll-I'll come and get you
first thing tomorrow.

No, Gran, I can't stay
another night.

Well, uh, I'll get someone
to drive me now.

JOHN: Ellie?
(siren wailing)

Ellie?
PEGGY: Hello?

PEGGY:
Hello?

Look, I have someone
who can help.

JOHN: El!
I'll call you.

PEGGY:
Ellie? Eloise?

JOHN: Ellie!
John!

John!

Ellie.

Thank God.

I saw the flashing lights,
and I thought...

I'm scared here.

I'll take you back to yours.

No, I want to go home.
Home, home.

I-I need to get out of London.

Can you help me get
to the train station?

Forget the train.
I'll drive you.

You have a car?

How else am I supposed to get

to North London
from South London?

ELOISE:
<i>Right, I'm gonna go in there,</i>

<i>get my things and never see
that fucking room ever again.</i>

JOHN: <i>Do you want me
to come up and help?</i>

ELOISE: <i>No, better not.
Ms. Collins would probably</i>

<i>kill you if she sees you again.</i>

Maybe if I plead, she might
give me some of my deposit.

Fuck.

If I'm not back in 15 minutes,
maybe come check on me.

Okay.

(sirens wailing in distance)

(door opens, closes)

Ms. Collins, it's me, Ellie.

MS. COLLINS:
Just coming, deary.

you've had a fright.

I need your help.

Just you, is it?

Yeah.

I'll put the kettle on. Come in.

("Alfie" by Cilla Black playing)

Your music upstairs got me
breaking out my old records.

Oh, I picked up
a letter of yours by mistake.

It's in that pile.

(Ms. Collins chuckles)

Don't judge me
on the cigarettes.

All that hoo-ha last night
got me going again.

Sorry.

Oh, it's not your fault.

I was always on the edge
of starting again.

So...

How can I help you?

Ms. Collins,
I-I'm really sorry to do this.

I-I didn't want
to be this person,

but I'm leaving tonight.

Oh.

Are you, now?

I'm not having
a very good time here, and I...

I really need to go back home,
and I promise...

I promise I'll pay you
for the mirror,

but I really need some of my deposit.
Slow down.

I don't want to beg,
but this has been a disaster.

Hush. Slow down.

Drink your tea.

You went to the police,
didn't you?

About the room upstairs, hmm?

Yeah.

A nice police lady came round

asking questions about you.

About your well-being.

Welfare check, she called it.

Had me worried.

You'd been saying
a girl died up there.

Sorry.
Oh.

It's funny 'cause...

there is some truth in it.


I hadn't thought about it
until you brought it up, but...

a girl did die up there,
I suppose.

The young me...

...that came to this big city.

Sandie.

MS. COLLINS: <i>I had hopes
and dreams like you.</i>

I wanted to be a singer.

I wanted to perform.

To act.

<i>Being a whore is a bit like
being an actress, I suppose.</i>

You have to pretend
you're someone else.

Someone that's not you.

I'd pretend
I was somewhere else.

LINDSEY (echoing):
<i>It's too late for you.</i>

That this wasn't
happening to me.

MS. COLLINS and SANDIE:
<i>Try and forget all those...</i>

<i>all those men.</i>

<i>Their faces.</i>

I'd blank them out.

I had to.

<i>Make like they were nothing.</i>

So, yes, you could say
Sandie died in that room.

She died in that room
a hundred times.

And then one night...

...the man who put me there...

...the man who put me to work...

...the man who stole my dream...

(echoing yell)

...well...


...I put a knife in him...

...a hundred times.

And do you know what, Ellie?

Oh, I can call you Ellie,
can't I?

Yeah.

It felt right, Ellie.

All those bastards

<i>who came ringing my bell,</i>
(doorbell ringing)

<i>creeping up my stairs,</i>

they sent me to hell, so...

I sent them to theirs.

The papers call them

<i>missing persons.</i>

As far as I'm concerned,
they were already lost.

So they don't know
where they are.

I say they didn't know
who they were.

(board sliding)

I was doing everyone a favor.

MS. COLLINS and SANDIE:
I wasn't gonna be used anymore.

I wasn't gonna let
this city break me.

I'm so sorry.

Why?

It's not your fault.

No, I mean I understand.

I know what you've been through.

Oh.

Do you, now?

Yeah, I didn't mean to get you
in trouble with the police.

Oh, it's all right.

They think you're mad.

And it's not like
you're gonna tell anyone else.

No. No, I'm not.

Of course not. I-I would never.

No. I mean...

I know you're not
going to tell anyone else.

(trembling breaths)

Oh, don't worry. I'm not gonna
stab you like the others.

I wouldn't do that to you. No.
(Eloise groaning)

You're gonna go to sleep.

And everyone will think you
just topped yourself because,

you know, they all thought you
were going to do that anyway.

(gasping breaths)

They're all very concerned
about you.

Bless.

So, you...

just get comfy, and...

you can doze off

listening to some of
that nice music of yours.

(groaning)
(shushes)

No more excitement
for you tonight.

(doorbell rings)


(Eloise coughs)

Just you, is it?

Little liar!

(Eloise coughs weakly)

(doorbell rings)
No.

Just coming, deary.


(Eloise gasping)


What is it?

Um, I'm here to see Ellie.

She's upstairs. Come on in.

Run!
