[note plays quietly]

Hello.


Hi.

What are you doing here?

Well...

He was my dad.

Right.

Also...

I came to see you.

â™ª

We're gonna have to get you
enrolled in school here, I guess.

It's winter break.

Oh, right.

Is Dad...

Grandpa...
really gone forever?

Yeah.

He is.

Thanks.
Have a Dandy day.

[bell over door rings]

Do we have to come here
every day?

We don't come here
every day.

Well,
we were here yesterday,

and the day before
yesterday,

and the day before
the day before yesterday,

Three more hours.

I've finished this one.
Well, go get another one.

Hey, Jessie.

Looking good.
Hey.

Just the gas?
Yeah.

Wanna...
get together tonight?

I can't.

You can't?

I'll make it
worth your while.

Thanks, but, I'm busy.

But thanks.

Come on.
Change your plans.

I can't.
I want to see you.



I'm all set up.

My parents are
out of town, it's like...

all set up.

Trip, it is not possible.

I am in
the middle of something.

I am trying to...
to get things right.

Oh.

Fuck.

Yeah.

Okay. [chuckles]

Whatever.

Jesus.

He's a fart face.

[snow crunching]

[Emma whimpers quietly]

It's gonna break!

It's solid through!

[Emma whimpers]

Come here!

I can feel it moving!

It's not moving!

Look at me!

Have a little faith.

Have a little faith!

Do you have a jack?

Do you have a six?

Go fish.

Do you have a ten?

Look who's winning!

[dogs barking]

So how you doing?


[indistinct conversation]

It's so weird.

Were you guys even close?

He was my dad.

Yeah, I get it.

He was an asshole, but,

he was always there.

to take the edge off.

I get it.
That's all.

I get it. I get it.
I got you covered.


[dogs barking]

[cat purring]

[cat chirps]

[cat meows]


Jessie.

Jessie.

We need to go shopping.

Jessie.

[birds cawing]

Have a nice day.


[loud thumps]

[loud thumps]

[hard rock music on stereo]

â™ª Falling faster now â™ª

[car approaching]

[hard rock continues]
â™ª Falling faster into sleep â™ª

Hey, Emma.
What you up to?

Waiting for Jessie to get up.

It's, like, almost 12:00.

Maybe you should just
go get her up.

I already tried, three times.
She won't get up.

I don't think she wants to.
She's gonna be mad.

[door opens, closes]

[Rick muttering]

God damn it!

Jessie, don't,
fucking... do this to me!

Do not do this!

[cat chirps]
It's okay.

Come on. Come on.

[siren wailing]

[indistinct chatter]
[rattle of equipment]

What did she take?

I don't know.
I don't live here.

I just came by to check on her,
and I saw her like that.

What does she usually take?
I don't know.

I thought she was clean.
[EMT] Okay, bring it down.

All right.

Hello.

Hi.
Oh, my God.

You've gotten so big.

Hi, Dad.

Hi, Jess.

How was the drive up?

We got lost three times,

and we did two circles
before we could find your road.

But we finally got here,
didn't we?

You are off the beaten path.

Yeah.

We really like it
a lot out here.

Do you want to come in?
I'll give you a tour.

I'm already running late.

She's gonna be okay
with you, right?

It's just one night.

Yes.

We're gonna be great.

We're gonna have so much fun
catching up, right?

Yep.

Are you thirsty?
I have some grape juice.

Sure.
[car starts]

I'm so glad you're here.

Look at this hair.

It's just like mine was
when I was little.

Were you sick?

I'm feeling much better now.

What's that?

A hammock.

Go try it out if you want.

Okay.


[motorcycle approaching]


What took you so long?

Miko's dicking me around.

I was playing cat and mouse
for a half an hour.

What, again?
Yeah, he's falling apart.

I got it all, though.

I got a bunch of deliveries
waiting on me.

Hi, Emma.

What you doing?

I'm swinging.

Wow.

You really are becoming
a woman, aren't you?

Jesus.

It's like time on speed.


[footsteps approaching]

Better?
Hmm...


My baby's gotten so big.

I should have woken her up
earlier, right?

Hey. It's not your fault.

She fucked up.

Is she gonna die?

Nah.

Morning.

Coffee?

I'm gonna go into the hospital
today, see your mom.

Maybe she woke up.

She's sleeping?

Yeah, they, um...

a deep sleep.

Deep sleep.

Like, dead sleep?

No.

Deep sleep like... coma...

sleep.

What's coma sleep?

It's sleep.

Just for a while.

I'll bring you news.

â™ª

Are you Rick's girlfriend now?

Yep.

Rick's my man.

[Christmas music plays
over stereo]

Do you know my mom?

I know her.

[Christmas music continues]

She was Rick's
girlfriend before.

I know.

She's in the hospital.

I know.

Rick said
she's not gonna die.

[mechanism clicks]

I think it's stuck.
It ain't stuck.

Pull back, not down.

Yank that baby back.

[grunts]
Holy cow. Let's go!

Is it cocked?
Yeah, it's cocked.

Are you sure?
Hey, careful with that.

That's ready to shoot.

Straighten your arms.

Grip it tight.

Ready, aim...

fire.

Holy fuck!

You hit that!
You hit it.

I hit it!

â™ª Ooh, I hit it,
I hit it, I hit it â™ª

â™ª Hit it, I hit it â™ª

Pew! Pew pew!

Pew pew pew pew.

Never seen such a lucky shot.

Pew pew.

Pew pew...
There's a squirrel. Shoot it.

Hey, hey!

What are you doing?

You're blind.
[chuckles]

Come on! Get off of me.
[giggles]

[foil crinkling]

[lighter flicking]

Okay, hold it over the flame.

Hold the spoon?

Yep, the spoon over the flame.

Closer.

[slaps arm twice]

You said we were gonna cook.

We're cooking, babe!

I want to cook cookies.

We're gonna do that after.

We just gotta
finish this first.

The spoon's getting hot.
Don't drop it.

Look, we're almost there.

See how it's starting
to bubble around the edges?

It looks like maple syrup.

Mm-hmm!
It's my special syrup.

Mm...

[grunts, inhales]


Good girl.

Nice job.

[inhales, exhales deeply]


â™ª

Okay...

What's an "oz"?

Hmm...

I don't know.

Like the wizard?

An "oz" of butter.

Oh.

I'm not sure.

Just put in the stick.

A stick like one
of these whole ones?

Just put that whole thing
in there.

Oh, I have to melt it.

[gas hissing]

How do I turn this on?

I need to melt
an oz of butter.

You said you'd help me!


[flame whooshes]

[chuckles]
One.

Two.

Three.

[metal music plays
on stereo]

Don't think too hard, now.
[laughs]

Did you see smoke
coming out of my ears?

You're gonna hurt yourself.

All right, I'm taking
the Middle East

from Afghanistan,
so who's got it?

I got the Middle East.

You're going.
You're going down.

You fucking terrorist.
Just grab the dice.

Who you calling
a fucking terrorist,

you ISIS slob?
You're history, Rick.

Whatever. Play the game.

Ahh!

Take two.
Back in your hole, Akbar.

[sputters laughing]
Hey, calm down, man.

Fuck ISIS.

That's not even where
Afghanistan is.

This map is grossly inaccurate.

And you would know.

Yeah, that is right.
I would know.

I'd never put my guys there.

You couldn't pay me
to put my guys there.

Hey, okay, I've got
all of the United States.

Who wants
to wrestle me for it?

I'll take you on.
You're on.

All right.
Wrestle?

You're disturbing him
in his...

[metal music plays faintly]

[yells indistinctly]
No, stop it, don't fight.

[indistinct chatter]

Mmm.

[adults singing]
â™ª Falling further down â™ª

â™ª Falling faster into sleep â™ª


Ooh! Cookies.

Just like my mama used to make.

De-fucking-licious.

Thank you.

Do you want a cookie?

Yeah, sure.

They're good.

I made them myself.

Chips Ahoy usually do me.

Maybe, uh, the elf dude.




Lonnie, give the girl a beer.
She's earned it.

Nothing beats homemade.

Girl Scouts, motherfucker.

Thanks.

Gross.

All right, I'll take it,

if you're not gonna drink it.

Giving you her beers,
making you cookies.

Got yourself a fine little
woman there, Rick.

What else does she do?

Leave her alone.
Jesus.

What?

You look like your mom.

She says I look like
my dad.

He's lame.
That's what she says.

[snorts, laughs]

[water dripping]

How'd you get those marks?

Dinosaur bite.

I thought dinosaurs
were instinct.

You thought wrong.

Is it scaly?

Touch it.

It's smooth.

Mm-hmm.

[birds singing]

You like it?

Is it yours?
Sure is.

Hey...

I'm gonna go on a ride now...

if you want to come along.

Where's Jessie?

She's taking a nap.

So, you coming?

Okay.

[motorcycle engine rumbles]

â™ª

You all right back there?

Yep.

Hold on tight.

I gotta talk to my friend
for a minute.

You stay here.

Can I come with you?

Dennis the Menace.

How's it going?

It goes.

Who's this?
[Rick] Emma.

Emma,
this is Dennis the Menace.

I gotta give Dennis something.
You stay here.

What took so long?

[Rick] Just shit.
[Dennis] Dude...

Can I look at stuff?

Hell yeah, knock yourself out.

What you doing, ladybug?

Where you going?

You look very nice today.

I like your polka dots.


Hi!

What are you doing
under here?

Emma, come on.

Where were you?
You took so long.

I was inside. Let's go.

Look what I found.
Isn't it cute?

You want that?

Can I?

Take it.

But...
Quick, before he comes out.

Now let's split.

Wait, I don't think
I should take it.

I can keep a secret.

Can you?
Yeah.

[kitten mews]

Then we got nothing
to worry about.

Don't be scared, okay?

It's gonna turn out
all fine in the end.

You holding on?
Yep.

[motorcycle starts]

â™ª Mama's little kitten
loves cat food, cat food â™ª

â™ª Mama's little kitten
loves ca-at food â™ª

â™ª Make the cat food,
put it in a bag â™ª

â™ª Send it to us
as fast as you can â™ª

â™ª Mama's little kitten
loves cat food, cat food â™ª

â™ª Mama's little kitten
loves ca-at food â™ª


â™ª

[voice vibrating]
Ahh....

[vocalizing continues]

When I'm talking about courage,

I'm not talking about
superhero stuff.

But rather, courage to face
life's everyday challenges.

It's these choices that
show us if we're courageous,

or if we're cowards.

It's choosing between
what's right,

and what is convenient.

It's choosing
our convictions...

over comfort.

Please rise for
the prayer to Saint Michael.

St. Michael the Archangel,

defend us in battle.

Be our defense against
the wickedness

and snares of the devil.

May God rebuke him,
we humbly pray,

and do thou, oh Prince of
the heavenly host,

by the power of God,
thrust into hell Satan

and the other evil spirits
who prowl about the world

for the ruin of our souls.
Amen.

The body of Christ.

The blood of Christ.

The body of Christ.

The blood of Christ.

Amen.

The body of Christ.

The blood of Christ.

Morality for $700.

Honoring or revering power,

pleasure, money, or another
creature in place of God.

Idol worship.
[bell dings]

[host] Sacred Heart.
[woman] What is idol worship?



Morality for 900.

that forbids greed

and the desire to amass
earthly goods

that belong to another.

Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's goods.

the tenth commandment?

is correct.

Now let's see.
With only one question left,

the team from St. Mary's Parish
has 1,700...

Ask to be excused.

Excused?
From the table. Sit down.

The answer is, this is required
to keep the Sabbath day holy.

[bell dings]
[host] St. Mary's.

our everyday work...

Um... may I be excused?

Yes, you may.


The team from St. Mary's
goes on to our Bonus Round!

Nice try, Sacred Heart.
Came up just a bit short.

S-so...

Good night, then.

Good night, Lonnie.

You can call me...

Daddy, I guess.

Yeah.

Did you tuck her in?

Yeah, I did it.

to the flag

of the United States
of America,

and to the republic
for which it stands,

one nation, under God,
indivisible,

with liberty and justice
for all.

You sure you don't want some?

No, I can't eat bacon.

Why?

I'm Muslim.

Why can't you eat bacon
if you're Muslim?

I just can't.

Hmm.

Catholics are allowed
to eat everything.

I don't think I could
be Muslim.

You're a Catholic?

Yeah, well, my family is,
so I think I am, too.

the body of Christ.

Isn't that cannibalism?

I don't know. But his blood
is really gross.

Hey!

Emma.

I thought that was you.

What are you doing here?

Nothing.

How's it going now?

Okay.

Hey, uh...

you want to maybe...

help me run a little errand?

What is it?
It's super easy, you'll see.

There's a hot fudge sundae
in it for you.

Okay.

Get in.

[death metal music plays]

[music continues]

Wait here.

Hi.

Come here.

Can you get that?


You're really pretty.

Thanks.

Don't move.

Look at me.

Don't blink.

I never got to wear makeup
until I was 15.

Oh... oh, my God.

All right, we ready to go?

Holy shit.

Come on, let's go.

Bye.

[country music on stereo]

You gonna eat that cherry?

The cherry's for last.

Mmm.

How old are you?

None of your beeswax.

I'm just saying.

I'm interested.

Interested in what?

So, uh...

I'm sorry about your mom.

Thanks for the sundae.

Sure.

â™ª The moon is low
and the grass is high â™ª

â™ª And there's gold buried
in your hair â™ª

â™ª There is no worry
upon your brow â™ª

â™ª Off to sleep now
without a care â™ª

â™ª Hear them come calling
it's Christopher Robin â™ª

â™ª And Pooh Bear
making their way â™ª


â™ª The horse and the carriage â™ª

â™ª A royalist marriage â™ª

â™ª And a pin prick
to bring on the day â™ª

â™ª Take this light,
oh whoa â™ª

â™ª And do not go gentle
into that good night â™ª

â™ª Because soon there'll be
voices telling you â™ª

â™ª Be simple,
be pretty, be small â™ª

â™ª Of all the choices
given to you â™ª

â™ª It's just which dress
to wear to the ball â™ª

â™ª I know things â™ª

â™ª Aren't the way
they ought to be â™ª

â™ª I can feel those old storms â™ª

â™ª Are brewing out at sea â™ª

â™ª Take this light,
oh whoa â™ª

â™ª And do not go gentle â™ª

â™ª Little girl â™ª

â™ª Sleep tight â™ª

[wind howling]

[Jessie sniffles]

Looks like you guys got
everything under control here,

so, uh, I'm gonna go.

You gonna be all right?

Uh-huh.

[truck engine starts]

I'm glad you're back.

[man on TV] Environmental
pressures can also change.

But as long as variation
in a population exists,

new adaptations can occur.

Where's the can opener?

Where's the can opener?


[exhales]
Do you have a...

...two?


Two.

Two.

[cat chirps]
Sweet dreams.

She does it every day.

You gotta walk her.

I got nothing to say.

Then just walk! Now get out.

[Lonnie sighs]
What's the point?

I'm taking you to school.

Okay.

Why didn't you want
to be my dad?

I do want to be your dad.

I'm here, we're walking.

I know, but, I mean...

why didn't you want to
be my dad when I was born?

I was going to war.

Who were you in war with?

Terrorists.

Didn't you want to know me
a little bit, though?

From the war?

It's different there.

It's empty, it's a desert.
It's just...

Just sand and heat.

You forget about
everything else.

Well, when did you get back?

allegiance to the flag

of the United States
of America,

and to the republic
for which it stands,

one nation, under God,
indivisible,

with liberty and justice
for all.

[phone chimes]

You're so lucky.

I want one so bad.

The tooth fairy gave it to me.

Seriously? The Tooth Fairy
only gave me five bucks

and you got a phone.

I got earrings last time.
They were pretty nice,

but I'd still rather
have a phone.

What does the fairy
do with the teeth?

I mean, maybe the fairy has
hundreds and thousands

and millions of teeth
just lying around.

[phone chimes]
Where does she put them?

I'm just saying.

What does the fairy do
with all the teeth?

Her mom's a retard
and her dad's crazy.

That's why she's a perv.


Oh! [whimpers]

[girls clamoring]

Hey. What's wrong?

Just don't... don't look back.
[Dawn] Mrs. Pinkins!

Mrs. Pinkins!

Mrs. Pinkins!

Mrs. Pinkins!

[Emma, whispering]
"The Goldberg

"is the strangest eel
in the sea.

"It lives in the cold,
dark ocean depths.

"It gulps down anything
that swims in its way.

"Eels are long,
slim, snake-like fish.

The eels in tropical waters
have spots and..."

[distant footsteps]

I think they're coming.

[footsteps grow louder]

[keys jingling]


She'll get a good talking-to.

You can be sure
about that.

Say you're sorry.

Say you're sorry.

[school bell rings]

I am so sorry. I...

I have to go pee.

It's not that hard to say.
Just say the words. "Sorry."

But I'm not.

Sometimes you
just say it anyway,

and take the high road.

When Jesus was slapped
across the face,

what did he do?

Did he slap back?

No, he did not slap back.

He turned the other cheek
for more,

because Jesus...

Jesus is love.

Well, if Jesus is love,

then why did he want
to be slapped?

Because he's strong
in his love.

[urinating] - And he
can absorb the punishment.

He takes it on himself

to relieve others
of their hate.

Wait, so instead of
punching Haley, I should...

let her punch me?

No.

You're not a very smart one,
are you?


Jesus died for your sins.

You know that, don't you?

Um, yeah?

Well, all right, then.

And your mama did not
abort you.

She kept you going.

What does "abort" mean?

That's when you're murdered

before you're even born
into this world.


Where is my mom?

Well, she, uh...

she got herself screwed up
because she was weak.

And, uh...

she did not follow
the ways of God.

[toilet flushes] - Does
Lonnie follow the ways of God?

Well, he's trying.

He's kind of screwed up, too,
but, um, he's trying.

Because of terrorists?

Well, maybe because of that.

Or maybe because he's
just not praying hard enough.

[toilet flushes]

You can't just pray.

You gotta pray hard.

â™ª

[random notes]

[dissonant notes]


â™ª

[imitates crow cawing]

[continues cawing]

[dial tone beeping]

Did you, uh,
finish up your chores?

Yep.

I heard something happened
at school today.

So...

what would you like
to confess?

Well, um...

Haley's not a very nice person,

so... I punched her.

But, I'm not really entirely
totally sure

that it's a sin.

'Cause she's a jerk face.

Do you want to get
into heaven?

Yes.

Then you need to truly repent.

Okay, but, she deserved it,
and that's the real truth.

Also, Sadie said that Jesus
turned the other cheek,

and Haley didn't turn
the other cheek,

but she did get punched once,

so she is absorbing the hate
like Jesus did.

So maybe that was helpful
for her, actually.

To be like Jesus?

We're talking about
your soul here, not Haley's.

The way to get
into heaven after

is to repent now.

You don't want to be
standing at the gates of hell

wishing you had just said
your penance, do you?

No.

Well...

then...

you owe God 40 Hail Marys.

[gun cocks, gunshot]

[Emma mutters prayer]

...blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...


Hey, I lost a tooth today.

Oh, you're growing up.

No doubt about it.

Should we celebrate
with the Tooth Fairy?

How about we celebrate
with my special grilled cheese?

Take this to the boys.

[gunshot sound effect]

Dinner's ready.

[gunshot sound effect]

Look, I lost a tooth today.

Wow. Radical.

Move! You're blocking
the target.

Comin' around that tree.
Yeah, I see.

[gunshot]
Twitch him.

Turn that thing off.
We're praying.


[gunshots continue]
[zombies hissing]

Turn that off.

And wait until the "amen."


Dear Lord...

help us to ward off the devil,
for he is real.

And show us your face, Lord...

for we will not forget it
once we have seen it.

Amen.
Amen.

Not too bad.

83 hits.

27 kills.

Dear God,

please save my soul
from going into hell.

Help my mom find me.

And...

tell the fairy
to come get my tooth.

Amen.


Here we go.

Cha cha cha.

How you guys doing?

How you doing at home?

One...

Now we're gonna take the
swivel side, and cross over.

Five.

One more time,
let's do these side crosses.

Back to mambo.

Front, cha cha cha.

Back. Front.

Cross it over.

Now let's cut that in half.

Two mambos.

Cross over.

March in place.

Now we're gonna change it
again. Walk forward.

Forward shimmy.
Here we go.

Looking good right there.

You go back.

Add your hair, your flavor.

Are we doing communion?

Put that all together.

The world is shit.

Five, from the mambo.

Cha cha cha.

It's better
you know that now

than to have
to find out later.

Forward.

Shimmy.

Going back.

Now we're gonna march
in place.

I pledge allegiance to the flag

of the United States
of America,

and to the republic
for which it stands,

one nation, under God,
indivisible,

with liberty and justice
for all.

I wonder how rocks are made.

Maybe they're made
from, like, boulders.

Or, like,
statues or something.

that rocks make statues?

statues make rocks.


This is my mom's house.

Uh...

[screen door creaks]

[locked doorknob rattling]

Boost me up.

I'm going in.

[Jabril grunts]

Where the fuck were you?

I almost called the police.


[Emma] Hi...
I didn't know what to do.

What are you, brain dead?

Don't you ever go there.

Are you sure
that you're okay, Emma?

Yeah, we went to a garage sale.
Look what I got.

[cat mews]

She wanted to go for a ride,
I took her for a ride.

You were gone for four hours.

You cannot even begin
to imagine the shit

that has been going
through my head.

What is with the cat?

It's a kitten.

"It's a kitten."

I'm naming him Ace.

How could you take her
without telling me?

You were sleeping.
She's fine.

Emma, you thirsty?

Yep. So's Ace.

[starting to cry]
[Rick] Don't worry about her.

[door thuds closed]

[Rick and Jessie
talking indistinctly]

swear on your mother or God

or whatever you swear on...

your bike, for fuck's sake...

that you didn't touch her.


You're sick in the head,
you know that?

I don't understand.

I don't understand why
you were gone for four hours.

I just... I just...
I don't understand.

That's all, shit.

Jessie. Jessie.

Shut your fucking mouth.

I'm not gonna say it again.

to make you mad.

I just want to know
where my little girl was.

I took her to Dennis's.

I told you I had drops to do.

[Jessie] Dennis?!
[Rick] She had a blast.

Are you insane?

And you bought her a kitten.

No, she stole the kitten.

You're starting
to make me angry.

I just... I don't understand.

That's all. I don't...
I don't understand.

[arguing
continues indistinctly]

[argument continues]
[Rick] Stop whining.

Stop whining at me!

[cat meows]
[Emma shushes]

Sweet kitty, sweet kitty.

Shh, shh...

[slaps hitting skin]
God damn it!

[argument continues]




[yowling loudly]

[yowling continues]

[yowling continues]


[social worker] And are you
getting to know your dad, then?

Um...

Yeah.

Mr. Pilsko?

Have you been spending some
quality time together?

He tucked her in.

He... he... walked her
to school one day.

Uh, they're getting acquainted,
in God's own good rhythm.

That sounds nice.

Um...

So, what did you talk about
on the way to school?

Terrorists.

Uh, okay.

[papers shuffle]

Dear Lord... [mumbles]

[sighs heavily]

Good night.



not to go in there.

[voices speaking
foreign language]

[singing in foreign language]

I would have shot 'em.

[shaky breath]


[Lonnie screaming]
[objects clattering]


Lonnie, I'm coming in.


Come here. Aah!

[Lonnie groaning]
Lonnie,

you gotta calm down now.

[Lonnie groaning]
[thumps, clattering]

Get 'em off of me!

[groans loudly]

He's not right in the head.

Like my mom?

Stay over there.
Surrender!

Honey, I'm coming in.

Aw, God!
[Lonnie] You hear me?

Lord God in heaven!

Aw, fuck!
Protect us from his sickness.

Surrender!

[Rick] What?
Lonnie's at it again.

I'm coming over.

[Lonnie] I can go more!
Bring it over, and hurry.


Now, you run away.
You run out that door

and you stay away
until it's all over.

I'm in my nightgown!
Get out, now!

Go, far away!

And pray for us!
[Lonnie] Now I see you.

Get out of there,
you fucking haji.



[Sadie and Lonnie
speaking indistinctly]

I'm beyond despair! Aah!

talking to you.

[vehicle approaching]

[metal music blaring]

Shit.
Hurry!

He'll do it finally.
Have you got something?

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got something.

Lon! Lon, man.

[Lonnie] Get the fuck out!
Hey, it's me.

Man, I'm here, I got your H.

I'll finish you!


Lon, friend, not foe.

Here's Rick, coming in,
all right?

I'm coming in.

Don't you fucking shoot me.

[Emma, whispering]
Hail Mary, full of grace,

The Lord is with thee.

Blessed art thou
among women.

Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, mother of God,

pray for us sinners now

and at the hour
of our death, amen.

Hail fairy, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

Blessed art thou among women.

Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, mother of God,

pray for us sinners now

and at the hour
of our death, amen.

Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

Blessed... Blessed...

Blessed art thou among women.

Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

and at the hour of
our death, amen.

He's calm now.

You go in there
and you comfort him.

Close your eyes.

[water spraying]

Why did you get so upset?

I've seen...

terrible things...

that I can't unsee.

[sobs quietly]

And I...

I love this country,
you know.

Me too.




Elle, ella, usted, es.

Elle, ella, usted, es.

Nosotros, nosotras, somos.

Nosotros, nosotras, somos.

Vosotros, vosotras, sois.

Vosotros, vosotras, sois.

Ellos, ellas, ustedes, son.

Ellos, ellas, ustedes, son.

So, you'll be the terrorist,
and I'll be Wonder Woman.

What do I have to do?

Well, I'm gonna have to
tie you up.

Oh.

Hold this.

[Jabril yawns]

Put your feet up here.

Do Muslims speak Spanish?

No, but I can speak
a few words of Arabic.

Well, this one can't
speak English,

so you can only communicate
with bird calls.

Muslims speak English.

No, not this one.

This one only uses
the bird language.

I can't speak bird.

You're a terrorist.
You speak bird.

What, like, "chirp chirp"?

You're gonna have to do a lot
better than that

if you want to communicate
with your people.

You're my captive now.

Don't try and resist.

Look, this is lame.
Untie me.

[school bell rings]

[Southern accent] Okay, mister,
I'm gonna need you to settle down

and listen real careful-like.

What the heck?

Now stop squirming,
and beg for your life in bird.

Don't shoot.
[cocks gun]

Beg.

Please?

In bird.

[imitates bird calls]

Now promise me
you'll always be my friend

and love me forever and ever
no matter what.

Okay.

You're not a traitor,
are you?

Okay, well,

break's over.

Gotta go.

Wait...
[zipper zipping]

Wait, Emma.

Wait, where are you going?

Emma!

[imitates bird calls]

[whistle blows]

Let's go, let's go!

No wet noodles.

Keep it up.

[whistle blows]

[all clamoring]

[school bell rings]

Untie me.

Ask in...
Untie me!

All right, calm down.

[Jabril sniffling]

It was just a joke!

â™ª

[[clears throat]

you say the prayer tonight?

[TV announcer]
...a full tank of chemicals

into your toilet bowl.

But the Little Blue Elephant
stays around to clean 24/7.

Even streaks are no match

for the powerful
Little Blue Elephant.

Jesus...

you heal the sinner
of their sins.

[TV announcer]
Here's how it works.

Six ounces of fresh water

passes through
the Little Blue Elephant

and brings
the cleaning chemistry

down the refill valve
into the toilet bowl.

If I had you
in front of me right now

I'd ask you why there's
so much dark shit all around.


[TV announcer]
...and no tools are required.

I love the Little Blue Elephant.

[TV announcer] Drop-in toilet
tablets only last for a week or two

and they can damage
the internal parts of...

Sometimes...

Sometimes life feels...

I like life.

Amen.

Amen.

[TV continues indistinctly]

Does God ever go on vacation?

Sometimes...

it feels like God's on vacation
but he's always here.

He watches everything we do.

Is God... fictional?

Why would you say that?

God is as real as you or me
or any of us.

Are fairies real?

Fairies don't exist.

Maybe you're getting them
confused with angels,

who come down from heaven...
Ghosts are real.

I'll tell you what's real.

Demons are real.

And that's why we need Jesus.

Because it's a war...

and we gotta win it.

[woman on TV] An incredible
value, so order now.

Good night.


Daddy.

Tomorrow will be better.

That's what they say.

Okay.

So, uh...

you like life, huh?

Yeah.

Why?

I don't know.

Okay.

Good night.
