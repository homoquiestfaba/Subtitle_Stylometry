<i>â™ª A dream is a wish</i>

<i>â™ª Your heart makes</i>

<i>â™ª When you're fast asleep</i>

<i>â™ª In dreams
You will lose your heartaches</i>

<i>â™ª Whatever you wish for
You keep...</i>

<i>â™ª Have faith in your dreams
And someday...</i>

<i>â™ª Your rainbow will come
Smiling through...</i>

<i>â™ª No matter how your heart
Is grieving...</i>

<i>â™ª If you keep on believing...</i>

<i>â™ª The dream that you wish
Will come... â™ª</i>

Pluto!

Now, to finish off
the perfect dream.

I'm coming,
my dream Min-nie-ee-ee!

Hey!
Keep it down up there!

<i>Hey, Mick. It's Goofy.</i>

<i>I can't sleep tonight</i>
<i>and thought</i>
<i>you'd like to know.</i>

<i>You know, I think</i>
<i>it all started</i>
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

<i>My dad used to say
it was time for bed,</i>

<i>but I'd just lay there
and close my eyes.</i>

<i>Probably 'cause</i>

I just want to dream!

Yes!

Yoo-hoo!

I'm coming, dream Minnie!

<i>â™ª The dream that you... â™ª</i>

Oh, I can't sing
with all this noise.

<i>â™ª A dream is a wish
Your heart makes</i>

<i>â™ª When you're fast asleep...</i>

<i>â™ª Your rainbow will come
Smiling through...</i>

<i>â™ª No matter how your heart
Is grieving...</i>

<i>â™ª If you keep on believing...</i>

<i>â™ª The dream that you wish
Will come true â™ª</i>
