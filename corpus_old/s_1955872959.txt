Hannah (over podcast):
This is Invisibilia,
I'm Hannah Rosen.

Alix:
And I'm Alix Spiegel.

Hannah:
Invisibilia is a show
about all the invisible forces

that shape human behavior.

And today, as part
of our concept album,

we're talking about
reality bubbles.

Most of us live in one.

It's our little corner
of the world

filled with the ideas
and the people that
we believe in,

and that we like best.

Alix:
And until recently,

how completely we lived
in these reality bubbles

and the concepts that both
created and sustained them

wasn't entirely
clear to us.

But then came the election,

and our bubbles suddenly
felt like a problem.

A lot of people were
suddenly aware

that they weren't ever
even exposed to concepts

or ideas that were clearly
influencing other people.

Hannah:
So, we offer you now

a practical guide
to bubble hopping.

Oh my God,
I love this song.

I love this song, too.
Spotify, baby!

It's changed everything.
Spotify is literally salvation.

â™ª â™ª

Excuse me.

Can you watch my stuff?

Woman:
No, I was in Portugal.
Man: Really?

Woman:
Yeah, I was in Lisbon.
Jasper: Fuck.

Hey y'all, so I think
the Internet went out.

I'm gonna work
on that for a bit,

until then, maybe use
pen and paper or something.

The Guy:
Okay, what do I got?


Okay, how 'bout this?

"Have your jackalope
call my jackalope."

Have your jackalope
call my jackalope.

And now try that
in an Australian accent.

(Australian accent):
Have your jackalope
call my jackalope.

"Good night, my meatballs."

Good night, my meatballs.

"Pop up on your mom!"

Pop up on your mom.

"Once a waterbed,
always a waterbed."

Once a waterbed,
always a waterbed.

"Gimme back that skort!"
Gimme back that skort!

"Come on down to Clown Town."
Come on down to Clown Town!

"Who threw the ham at me?"
Who threw the ham at me?

"Can I borrow that merkin?"
Can I borrow your merkin?

"Have mercy."
Have mercy!

You're really good at this.

Thanks, man.
I could do this all night.
(phone dings)

You want... you want
to give this a shot?

I got time for one round.
Come on!

You good with those two?
Perfect. Thank you.

Yeah, man.
That's a hundred.

â™ª Atomic bomb â™ª

Oh, the flip phone!

That's why your
fucking text
was so weird.

I thought you were
stroking out, man.

That was such
a weird text.

Sorry about that.

I'm just, uh...

trying to stay off the Internet
as much as I can.

Oh, yeah?
What prompted that?

I don't know.
I just started to feel like
everything in my life was...

curated by an algorithm,
you know?

So how's
it working for you?

It's my first attempt,
you know.

I'm just trying
to stay off social media.

But I'm tethered to a laptop

in a cafe with Wi-Fi
all day for work.

It's like I...
I can't stay off my sites.
I am totally addicted.

Yeah, I get that.

But, you know, you can't
just go fucking cold turkey

with a flip phone,
you know?

You probably gotta,
like, step into it.

You know what you could do?

I have these other
clients who do

a totally tech-free evening
one night a week.

No tech, no electricity.

They just,
like, light candles
and play board games,

and sing magical songs,

or... fucking...
I don't know what they do.

They're pretty
charming, though.

You should try it out.
That's a good idea.


What the fuck is this?

Oh, it's a vape, dude.

Yeah, you should
definitely go tech-free.


Uh, can I use
your bathroom?

Yeah, sure,
it's over there.

But can I use
your bathroom?

Yeah, just turn the fan on
afterwards.

Cool.
I'm gonna light it up.

(siren whoops outside)

(lighter flicks)

Man: The blatant denial
of things that none of us

really want to face
in getting real.

We've arrived at Act Two
of our program. Act Two.
The lie becomes...


(candle clatters)

â™ª Atomic bomb â™ª

Chef:
Lastly, the ricotta is
accompanied by roasted beets,

nettle pesto,

crushed pistachios,
and focaccia.

And that's $16.00.

Any questions?


All right.

Um, while I have you,

my show is on Friday,
at 9:00, at Star Bar.

Are you gonna show
the "Top Hat" video?
Oh, I love that one!

I don't know, actually,
but it's, um, it's gonna
be really funny.

Yeah, I'll be there.
Woman:
Yeah, me, too.

Raina: Thank you.
Woman 2: Me too!

Cool, I'm coming too,
and I'm bringing B9.
(phone chimes)

(women cheering)


â™ª â™ª

(phone chimes)

Raina:
This is insanity.

Didn't you block them?

Yeah, I blocked them.

It doesn't matter.
I get flooded with texts,
constantly.

These are so gross.
Yeah.

You should, like, go off
Twitter for a week.


(phone chimes)

â™ª â™ª

(drill whirring)

(distant siren wailing)

Okay, if you need me,
scream. Okay?

(phone vibrating)

Wow.

Still texting?

I think you need
to call the police.

(door chimes)

Hi, we're closed.

Right on.
Bye.


(lock clacks)

â™ª â™ª

Okay.

â™ª â™ª

(horn honks)
Jesus!

(horn honking)

Solomon:
You're not gonna
feel it right away.

You know, don't read it.

The thing is, it's a little bit
over a long period of time.

So it's like microdosing?

Yeah.
I heard of that!

Okay.
Yeah, I know some people
who microdose.

Acid, but yeah.
Yeah?

Not gold.
It's... it's a form of gold.

It kind of looks
like Molly.

Well, I assure you,
it's not.

And the positive effects
last much longer.

Oh!

Oh, thank you.
What's this?
Boing.

Deejaying
a wicked gig tonight.

So, if you wanna
come 'round,

I'll put you on the list.

That's very nice of you.

And thank you for the gold.
(phone chiming)

Of course.
Hold on, let me take this.

Yeah.
Hey!

What's going on, Raina?

Raina (on phone):
Nothing, I'm sorry
to call you.

I know that you prefer texts.

The Guy (on phone):
No, it's fine.

You home?
I am!

Cool. Be like
an hour or so?

Okay, thank you.
That's perfect.

Cool. I love you.

Oh. (laughs)
Um, thank you.

Bye.

Damn it.

Daria:
Do you want me to BCC
Bebe and Cece Winans?

Jo:
Of course!

But then BCC Bebe Neuwirth.

But Cece Peniston told me
to CC Bebe...
(phone chimes)

...not BCC Bebe,
'cause she cannot be trusted.

Okay, that could work.
Jo: Okay.

Jo:
Have you guys
seen my blue wig?

Oh, Kayla has your blue wig.

You lent it to her
at Ars Nova.

Jo:
Oh, fuck, you're right.

(knocking at door)
Daria: You're not
gonna get it back.

Oh... (whispers)
Who is that?

Is it your neighbor?
Jo: I'll get it.

The Guy: Hey!
Oh, hey.

Weed.

Jo: Come in.
The Guy: How are ya?

Hi!
Daria: Hi!

I'm so sorry about that...

"I love you"
moment on the phone.

It was so weird.
Raina: Oh!

Don't worry about it.
I had a hard week,

so it was actually sort of nice
to have some positive energy.

I said "I love you"
to my therapist.

That happens.

Um, wait. How did you get
in the building, though?

Uh, the neighbor
downstairs let me in.

Oh, yeah.

Stuff like that happens
all the time, you know?

People just slip in
behind someone,

and then...
the worst happens.

Yeah. Looks like you guys
are doing something...

something.
We got a show.

The Guy: Oh, yeah?
Daria: Yeah.

You want to come?

Lots of invitations today.

Oh, wow. I didn't know
you all performed together.

I'm actually gonna
sit this one out.

I don't feel up to it, so...

Yeah, I don't really
feel like going there,

and being like,
"You ever been on Tinder?"

You know, it just,
like, isn't real.
Raina, come on.

You know how much I promoted
this on social media.

I do know, but...
I got blocked
by my mom.

Well, I'm not surprised,
but I can't do it.

So, I don't want to.
Jo: I'll stay with you.

And... stand by you.
What?!

Jo!
I know the plan.

You're gonna go.
I'm gonna stay.

I don't know if I'm gonna go.

I'm not committing.
Raina: It's fine.

I'm just gonna sit back,

and if you call,
and I don't answer,

just know that I went painfully.

It was hard.
It was a tough death.

Jo: Not funny.
All right.

This is what they want.
They want you to be
scared in your home.

The Guy: "They"?
Daria: You have to come.

The Guy:
I don't want to interrupt,

but is anyone gonna
actually buy weed?


(clears throat)

Hey, everyone.

It's Raina Noriega.

Your girl made a mistake.

Fuck.


Hey, Internet,
it's Raina Noriega.

You might not know me.
I'm not shocked if you don't.

Small career.

I made a huge mistake earlier.


Hi, this is Raina Noriega.

I wanted to apologize.

I'm very sorry for a tweet
that I had sent earlier.

Um, I want to apologize
to my family,

and my friends
who've been affected,

and to everyone that I hurt,
'cause I'm realizing now
I hurt a lot of people,

and that was never my intention.

You know, I have less
than 20,000 followers.

I didn't think
it would get around.

I should not have joked about
murdering the president...
and his family.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª You wrote the plot
out from the start â™ª

â™ª And made yourself
a beating heart â™ª

â™ª I was the one who
stole your crown... â™ª

Jenna:
What made you want
to break the world record

for longest individual
dance marathon?

Gloria:
Okay, so I'm not actually
trying to break the record.

In fact, when the time runs out,
I'm stopping it right there.

Because I want to share
this with Kala,

you know, she's the one
who already broke the record,

I actually want to share
the glory with her.

So, she inspired you?

Kind of. I was...

I was dancing one night,
and I thought...

No, no, no, I didn't
actually think at all.

I felt, "This is
fucking freedom."

And how fucking awesome
is the human body?

I mean, we actually have
no idea what it can do.

So I figured, why not see
how long I can go?

Yeah.
Why do we do
anything, you know?

The woman who currently
holds the record

was hospitalized
on her first attempt.

Are you not worried?
Oh, yeah,
she got all dehydrated.

So, I'm way ahead of that.

I've got shit-tons
of coconut water from CostCo.
Okay.

I, uh, I have Michael,
my doctor friend
somewhere around here.

He's attending to my needs.

And, uh, actually...

I'm a fucking animal.

So, uh, you can actually
put that in your article.

Oh, Jimmy!

Looking pretty good
out here, Morning Glory!
Hi! Hi!

God! This is amazing!

God! When'd you...
What's all this?

Well, I had to make sure
you were set up.

I won't be able to stay
for the whole deal, right?

My God,
you are a sweetheart.

So sweet. Wait!

Who's on the music, guys?

Crowd:
Nine, eight...
Man: Here we go, here we go!

Okay?
Okay, night-night!

Maia: Night-night.
Gloria: All right, kids!

I'm gonna take it inside,

Coming right behind you.

Don't stop moving.
(people whooping)

(muffled music playing)

(music continuing)

Wake up, wake up, wake up!

Wake up or go home!

What's up?

Do we need reinforcements?
Oh my God!

Wake up, wake up, wake up!
We're up, we're up!

Good, I've got more to do.
Wake up!

Just a little bit.
Come on.

Dance, dance, dance, dance.

Oh, I know, but I gotta go.
Wish you didn't have to.

Here's the thing, Gloria.
Gloria, you have got this.

You... you're almost there.

You're on your way.
Mm-hmm.

And I'm gonna be there
with you in spirit,

just... are you gonna be okay?

Can you hold on
to this wall? The wall?

Good. You got it?
Yeah.

I love you.
You got it? There it is.

Okay, I'll... I'll see you.
I love you, sweetheart.

Bye. Bye. Yeah?
Jim?

Bye.
Bye, honey. Bye.

Call me.

(music playing)

Cupcake:
Guys, I never thought
I would say this,

but I, like, can't do this.

I, like, cannot dance anymore.

I feel bad leaving her.

Vax just got here though.

Michael's there
and he's a doctor.
She's gonna be fine.

These are gonna help you
with your ankle swelling.

Yeah, yeah.
Don't stop.

Maia:
Glowworm!

You're looking
jacked-up, girl.

I am almost halfway there, Maia.

You look all the way done.

(Gloria mumbles)

I got a lot more in me.
Maia: Mm-hmm.

(dog barks)

(music playing)

Gloria: Oof!
Michael: All right?

Don't ask me.
You're dancing, dancing.

Here we go. Here you go.

All right, you want
some food? Huh?

Can I get you some food?
Cramps.

Huh?
My right hip.

Yeah.
How's that ankle, huh?
Little swollen.

Maybe you can put a little...
strap some ice on that?
(phone chimes)

Yeah?
Uh-huh. You dancing?

Yeah, that's nice.
Oh.

(clears throat)
This is Dr. Price.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

You don't have to do this.
No.

Dance.
You got to stop.

Jesus Christ.

This is getting
out of control.

Jim:
Hey, hey!

anything for you.

I will do anything
to help you...
(liquid trickling)

Come on, talk to me!
Pick me up!

Come on.

Yeah, this subway tile's

You guys did such a good job.

Dan:
Thank you!

It's coming along.

And you're going to Iceland
next week, man?

I've always wanted
to go to Iceland.

Yeah!
When are you leaving?

Next Wednesday.
I'm fucking excited!

Oh, I bet.
It's honestly the most
beautiful place on Earth.

Yeah, what are you gonna do
when you get there?

Oh, well, I got the
whole thing planned out.

We're going to ReykjavÃ­k,

and we're gonna
land there first.

Uh-huh.
I got one of those
Mercedes Sprinter RVs.

And we're gonna camp
all the way around
the countryside.

Oh. On that Ring Road?
Just camping out.

Exactly!
That is...

We're bringing our bikes.
It's gonna be sick!

Hello, hello!
Oh, hey, man!
Hey!

What's up?
Oh, not much.

You know,
a slave to the job.

Oh, I get it.

It's what vacations

I know, and you're
going to Iceland. Say hi...


Iceland?!

Oh, I fucking knew it!
(phone chiming)

Iceland!
Damn, you motherfucker,

I knew it!
Dude, it was my second guess!

Motherfucker!
Just...

Hey Jim, what's up, man?

Jim (on phone):
Hey, you around?
My lady friend needs some help.

Yeah, happy to help.

(playful growling)

(instrumental music playing)

Hello?

Hello?

Hello?

Oh, hey, Gloria!

I'm friends with Jim.

Jimmy.

Yeah, Jimmy.
How are ya?

Oh, Jesus.
You okay?

I'm dancing.
Yeah, he said you're doing
a dance marathon.

Oh, hi.

Oh, wow.

You're gonna dance
for a whole nother day?

Well, that's what they say.

Well, Jim asked me
to get you a little something.

No, Jimmy...
To help you out here.

Maybe this'll help.

Do you want me
to light it for you?
Oh.

Sucio.

Sucio?
Mmm.

I'll dance with you.

You're sweet.

Here you go.
Everybody left.

Everyone left?
Mmm.

Yeah, I imagine
it's probably pretty hard
to do this without people here.

It's not child's play.

No.

Pretty good, huh?

This is Amnesia Haze.

Oh!

You know, it's like, uh...

Mm, I'm not afraid
of death, you know?

What?

Never have been.


Mm-mm.

Oh. Still dancing.

Mm-hmm.
Still dancing.

Before you came,
I was really thirsty.

And I was thinking about
the caves of Lascaux.

Lascaux?
You know 'em?

In France,

where the Neanderthals
and Homo sapiens

gathered together
at the same time,

there was overlapping.

And...

the ones who made
the art won.

That's what they saw

in the layers
of the caves at Lat...

No, Germany,
not Lascaux.

And they...

sang.
