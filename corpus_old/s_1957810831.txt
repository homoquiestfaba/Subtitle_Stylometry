Hello.
Hey.

Let me put up my monitor.

I'd like to withdraw
$25 from my account.

Big bills.

Yeah, I prefer big bills

Do you have a paper
I could borrow?

Yeah.
Thank God it's Friday.

It's been one of those days.

My neighbor knocked
on my door at 5:00 a.m.

Uh, yes, ma'am.

<i>And what do you look like?
Are you Black, white, Hispanic?</i>

with any groups. It's just me.

<i>Okay.</i>
Yeah.

<i>Okay, my officers are asking if
you let the employees leave the bank.</i>

<i>Brown?</i>

<i>Brown?</i>
Nah.

I... I can't do that. I can't
do that. I can't do that.

As long as everybody stays
calm, nobody gets hurt, okay?

I promise I-I won't hurt nobody,
but I can't let them go. Sorry.

I'm... I'm gonna let y'all out

if I detonate the bomb, okay? Okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

Ma'am, I need to speak to
somebody, a negotiator or someone.

I'm running out of time.
I just...

<i>I do have someone on the

Uh, the bank.

<i>What is their number,
can you ask them?</i>

<i>Confirm I have the right one.</i>
She doesn't have the bank number.

She could call the land line. One, eight...
<i>- I could find it.</i>

<i>Brown, what kind of clothing

Why are you asking me that?

What kind of clothes... Why?

But why are you asking me that?

Why did you
just ask me that question?

You got the sniper on me?

I don't want them to snipe me. I don't want

<i>Yeah, I'm online here.</i>

Do you have someone

<i>If you want to speak with him,
you will need to tell me.</i>

Ma'am, I do not have as

<i>Hello, they're going to call. And once
they do that, you can talk with them,</i>

I ain't going to hurt you. I ain't gonna

Okay?

Why don't you

Uh, what do you like?

Go to the club?

They didn't kill him?
Mm-mmm. No, sir.

He got to be white.

Estel, can you get on the phone
with the network?

But call 911 first. This woman

I gotta go to my desk for that.
Okay.

That's fine, and shut
those doors again, okay.

They come in here,
they gonna shoot everybody up.

Spray and pray. That's how they do.
Okay.

When? When?

When you first asked me to.

Okay. Okay. It's all right.
Forgive me.

Okay.

Is there another dial-out number
I could use here?

I need to contact my people, make sure
they know what's happening, you know?

Don't want to have
everybody worried.

You could use that one over there.
Yeah?

Yeah. I'm going to leave here.
Don't want you to do anything.

I'm just going to move
over there, take a call, okay?

and there's a man
holding up the bank.


There is a man holding us up.

[line ringing]

<i>Hi, this is Cassandra Deets. Drop
what you're gonna ask at the beep.</i>

[message tone beeps]
Come on, baby.

We could use some help.

Ma'am, are you there?

[line ringing]

<i>Hi, this is Cassandra Deets. Drop
what you're gonna ask at the beep.</i>

[phone rings]

Hello?
<i>Hey there.</i>

<i>Is this the Windy Hills
Wells Fargo?</i>

Uh, yes, ma'am.
This is the Wells Fargo.

<i>Uh, yeah, I need to talk

Unfortunately, uh, Bridget is

Sorry to hear that, ma'am.

I'm sorry.

How much money do you need, sir?

I can get it for you.
[line ringing]

It's sitting right up there.

[automated voice]<i> You have reached
the voice mailbox of...</i> [Kiah]<i> Kiah.</i>

I don't want the bank's money.

I just want the cash...

that those people took from me.

That's all I want.


Okay. Okay, it's okay! It's
okay. I got it, I got it, I got it!

Go! Go! Go!

What happening? Who's shooting?


It's all clear.

He's gone.
<i>Estel, do you need me?</i>

[Rosa crying]

<i>Are you okay in there?</i>
Sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

It's just a reflex. I'm sorry.
<i>You still have a visual on him?</i>

No. No. I'm sorry,
okay. I apologize.

Ma'am, I apologize, okay?
I did not mean to do that.

How come y'all letting people
walk up to the entrance?

It seems like y'all
could do better than that.

You gotta get us out of here.


Hello?
<i>Yes, I'm here.</i>

I still don't have a damn
negotiator, and I'm wondering why.

Where's my negotiator?

Hello?

<i>All right,
hang on just a second.</i>


Sir, we can really help you.
Please, um... Please don't!


I had a button made, okay.

You see this?

We got kids.
Please don't, sir.

I need my negotiator. Somebody...
Somebody to come down and talk!

To talk! That's all!

Where's my negotiator?
Please, ma'am, just...

<i>Sir. Just hold onto the phone
right here...</i>

I've been holding on.
I've been holding on though.

I've been holding on though.
I held on.

<i>If we get disconnected,
I'll call you right back, okay?</i>

<i>Okay?</i>

You gonna have
my negotiator ready for me?

Ma'am?

<i>Yes, sir, you just hold

<i>I'll get him on.</i>
Okay.

[busy signal beeping]

[hangs up receiver]

I'm sorry, y'all,
I had to do that.

Any of y'all ladies

I could do to use the restroom.
All right, go on then.

[Rosa breathing shakily]

You okay?

[door creaks, closes]


[typing on phone]

[phone rings]

Hello? Okay. <i>I have
Major Riddick on the phone.</i>

Okay.

Check on Estel
in the bathroom, okay.

Make sure she good, aight?

<i>You there, sir?</i>
Uh, yes, I am.

<i>Hello, Mr. Easley.
My name is Major Riddick.</i>

<i>Now you tell us
what's going on in there, okay?</i>

The Department of Veterans Affairs...
Estel?

Estel.

They left me destitute
and homeless and, uh...

I'm... I'm going to be on the streets.
So I need your assistance, sir.

<i>All right.
What can we do to help you out?</i>

Well, pay me my money.

That's the whole reason why we
having this conversation, sir.

<i>All right, how much...
How much is that exactly?</i>

Estel, I think we're gonna be
on the TV. Turn it on.

We're gonna be on one of
the channels. Sorry about that.

<i>Well, would you be willing to come
outside and talk... talk to us about that?</i>

Sir, I'm not coming outside.

<i>All right, what are your
intentions right now?</i>

Well, uh,

my intentions are to blow up this
place if my demands aren't met.

I told y'all before. I don't know why
I have to repeat myself, but okay.

Uh, you know, I'm serious, sir.
I will blow this place up, sir.

<i>- Okay. Okay.</i>
Oh, sir, most importantly,

I want to talk to my daughter.

I can't seem to get through.
<i>All right.</i>

<i>Call you back in a little bit, Mr. Weasley,
okay?</i> Yeah, that is absolutely fine.

[busy signal beeps]

Okay.

[hangs up receiver]

What you think? Think
the conversation was good?

Yes. I think it was a
good conversation. You?

Yes.
Yeah.

Yeah.

[dialing on phone]

[line ringing]

[cell phone buzzing]

Mom?
Mmm.

Mama?
Mm-hmm.

[buzzing continues]

Mama.
Mm-hmm.

Mom.
Mm-hmm.

Someone must really
wanna talk to you.

Okay, baby. My phone...

Okay.

Okay.

Let me see.

Okay, baby.

Hello.

calling you all morning.</i>

<i>Why you ain't
pick up your phone?</i>

All right, all right, all right.
I'm up now, all right?

I just... Why you call me so many
times? It's not even your number.

That's why you should have picked up your
damn phone. I've been callin' and callin'...

I had a patient die at four o'clock this
morning. I'm gonna go back to sleep.

Oh, no. Don't do that, okay?
Hey, look, uh...

I'm in the middle
of something and, um,

depending on how everything works out,
I... I might go to jail for a long time.

Okay. Listen, Brian, I...

Are you off your medication?

Don't do that, Cass.

<i>I was just calling
to tell you that</i>

<i>if something
were to happen to me...</i>

<i>I'm trying to do right, okay?</i>

<i>I'm trying to right something
here, and I'm in a little situation.</i>

<i>And I just wanted you to know
I'm just trying to do the right thing.</i>

<i>I'm trying to make the
right decisions.</i> Yeah...

And I'm just trying to tell you
that everything I do...

Everything I do
is for you and Kiah.

Mm-hmm.
<i>Everything.</i>

Yeah, well, uh, Brian, I don't...

I don't really know where
you're going with this, so...

I don't know what...
Okay, thank you. [chuckles]

You know what, you right.
Put my daughter on the phone.

<i>All right. But don't you be
spooking her like you did.</i>

I never spook our baby.

<i>Yesterday you told her how you
got thrown on the street in handcuffs.</i>

She needs to know how this
world treats people like us.

<i>I'm just letting her know. She's
about to be in the world herself.</i>

Yeah, all right, Brian.

I'm not going through this
with you again, all right?


Kiah!

<i>Your father's on the phone,
Kiah.</i>


<i>She got reason to be.</i>

Cassandra...

I'm holding up the bank, and now's not the
right time to be ignoring my calls, okay?

<i>I've got hostages. I'm holding
up the bank.</i> You're not... [laughs]

<i>So, could you put my daughter
on the phone, please?</i>

Thank you.


Hey, hey, hey, baby girl.

Don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

Hey.

I just wanted to let you know
that I love you, okay.

Are you apologizing
and picking me up?

<i>You gonna be mean to Daddy?
You ain't gonna give Daddy a break?</i>

<i>Baby, you know
I'll always tell you the truth.</i>

And, uh, I hurt you.
I did.

<i>Well, you shouldn't have
given me your word.</i>

I apologize, baby.
<i>That's not telling the truth.</i>

You hate when people don't
tell you the truth. <i>I know. I know.</i>

Baby, you know, sometimes when people
steal from you, you've got no choice.

You gotta get it back.

And when I do,
I'm gonna get you a puppy.

Are you for real?
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

<i>Yes. That's the first thing
on my list.</i>

Okay, call me when you're ready.
Love you. Bye.

Don't hang up. Hey.
[busy signal beeps]

What did your father say?

He got money, so he's
gonna get me my puppy.

Just like your damn mama.

You look scared.

You scared?

I am.

I told you...

if I die today...

I die alone.

[helicopter approaching]


[gunfire in distance]

[phone ringing]

[picks up receiver]

Hello?

<i>Hi, is Bridget back yet?</i>

Ma'am, the bank is being robbed.
I'm the one robbing it. Do not call again!

[Brian sighs]

Come on, man.

Come on.

[news reporter on TV
speaking faintly]


[news reporter on TV
speaking faintly]

Kiah. Baby,
go back to your room.

Why I gotta be in my
room, Mama? Listen.

When I know what I need to
know, I'll let you know, okay?

Please, baby. Just
go back to your room.

Thank you.


My ex-husband... same thing
happened to him almost.

[Estel sighs]

I, um...

I'm scared.

But I feel compassion for you.

You know, my son
and, uh, I... [chuckles]

...we go to downtown Atlanta
on the weekends,

pass out to the homeless.

And they have stories.

People judge. They underestimate
how folks get in their position.

I know stories like yours.

They fought for the country,

and they come here and they
don't get approved, and I'm like...


I'm sorry.

[cell phone buzzes]

Who's that?


An old friend.

It's your ex-husband.


I mean, if... if it is, you
probably should hit him back.

Ain't nothing harder on the
heart than reaching out to an ex

and not hearing from them.

I see you love your family.

My close family.

My daughter,

Kiah.

Maybe if you let us out,

we'll tell them how good you been to us.
They're not gonna kill me?

They're not gonna kill me?

Did you tell me about your
family and your husband

and your good times

'cause you think I'm a fool?

No.
Try to soften me up? Is that what it is?

You think I'm dumb or slow?
Is that what it is? No. Not at all.

'Cause people be doing that a lot.
Thinking I'm a fool, thinking I'm slow.

I... I don't know if that's
what you was doing, ma'am.

Brother, you're not a fool.

I'm not a fool?
Okay. I'm not a fool.

I'm just scared. [chuckles]

That's all. Scared.

Okay.

I understand.

You gonna turn the TV off.
This is not working.


Did y'all just turn off the TV
in the bus... in the business?

You've got to let me know
what he's doing inside the bank.

Excuse me if I'm not doing
exactly what you need of me.

I don't know what y'all are doing. We
need someone to negotiate with him now.

[police chattering]

Hey, how you doing?

Riddick
is setting the perimeter.

Wants the area clear of any
potential bombs or co-conspirators.

Okay. We got four
SWAT units here.

Cobb County PD, plus Marietta.

Cobb sheriff's team is out.

Got the dogs.

[dog barks]
Smyrna PD.

We got the FBI, the GBI.

Everybody here.
Got yourself a party.

So how many snipers we got?

Uh, three units,
as I understand.

But like I said,
there's a lot going on.

That's the new chief?
Yeah. That's him.

[line rings]

[phone rings]

WSB-TV tip-line. This is
Lisa Larson. What's your tip?

<i>Hello, this is, uh,
Brian Brown-Easley.</i>

<i>I'm heisting a Wells Fargo
on Windy Hills Road,</i>

<i>and I have a bomb and hostages.</i>

You're what?

<i>Just calling to let
y'all know.</i> Uh...

You're at the Wells Fargo...

You're at the Wells Fargo now,

at the bank...
Holding up the bank

and you're calling us at WSB?

<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

Uh, what was your name again,
sir, please?

<i>My name is Brian Brown-Easley.</i>

Brian Brown-Easley.

Okay, you hold one sec.
<i>Okay.</i>

I want you to sit here,
close to the camera.

Lisa's got the Windy
Hill robber on the line.

All right, I'm hot.

You got sound?


We're recording.

Okay, thank you. Um...

And how would you like to
be addressed? Is it Brian?

<i>Or... Or Mr. Easley?</i>

Brian's good.
<i>Okay, Brian.</i>

Why are you holding up
a bank today, sir?

<i>Because I'm a nobody to the VA.</i>

You know, just so we
can verify who you are,

do you have a social
security number or something?

You trying to steal my
money too, like the VA?

<i>No, no, no.</i> [chuckles]
Trying to take my cash?

No, I'm good. I'm not
trying to steal your money.

This is...
This is just so we can help.

<i>Ma'am, just so you know,
I don't have a criminal record.</i>

<i>I mean this is not
my day-to-day.</i>

Well, but you say you have
bombs, right? Where'd you get that?

Oh, I can't give you
that information, ma'am.

<i>Well, is it something that
could, you know, level the bank?</i>

Probably gonna
take out the whole room.

<i>What kind of bomb?</i>

Semtex.
<i>Semtex?</i>

Take care now.

You too.

[siren blares]
[police radio chatter]

[helicopter flies over]

Wells Fargo security</i>

<i>and see if they have the cameras
inside that we might be able to access?</i>

[indistinct radio chatter]

Major Riddick.

Sergeant, you up
to speed? Indeed.

Okay, we're ready
to conference in.

We're conferencing in.
[phone beeps]

Ma'am, I'm... I'm not a thief.

<i>Okay, I haven't taken anything
from the bank.</i>

<i>I'm a decorated marine.
I'm a lance corporal.</i>

Who's this on the phone?


So why is the suspect talking
to a reporter and not us?

We were just buying time
until you decided to show up.

<i>Two tours Iraq.</i>

Camp Fox and Taqaddum.

Honorable discharge.


<i>And did you make friends? You know,
along the way that you've kept up with?</i>


but we lost contact, you know.

I don't really check in with
nobody or everybody these days.

I kinda stay to myself.

<i>So the VA...
What's going on there?</i>

[typing on keyboard]

Okay. Okay. Thanks.

So it looks like this payment
was redirected

to a college you're using
your GI Bill at, to cure a deficit.

Good news is, you're all
caught up on payments.

I was not behind on anything. Damn, I
overpaid on that Windows '08 bullshit.

Disability checks never are
confiscated unless there's an unpaid bill.

Does an unpaid bill
sound familiar?

I've been over this with
the VA helpline. Twice.

I called the-the VA crisis-line.

I called, uh, Lincoln Tech.

I been down to the office, but you...
you know what the problem is, ma'am?

You don't write nothing down.
[sighs]

If you put that pen to that paper,
you would have that information.

Please, please don't raise
your voice, Mr. Easley.

It's just a suggestion.

I ain't raising my voice.
That's who's got your money.

I have two jobs.

Two.

I've been ill.

I had to take leave, so I'm
reliant on this disability check.

Ma'am, don't dip into my money
and call it a day.

You gonna have me on...
On the streets.

I'm a grown man.

I won't be able to feed myself.

We have programs for those
who are food and housing insecure.

You can call the helpline or you can
take a number and wait in that line.

Okay.

Thank you.


[service desk chimes]

Yeah, they said I still owe,
which is a damn lie.

It's a lie.

very frustrating.

<i>It was. I'm not a psychopath.</i>

I know what I do
and I know what I don't.

I know, I hear you.
<i>Truth.</i>

I hear you, Brian.

Do you?

What station is this again?
<i>WSB-TV, why?</i>

<i>We're recording right now,
we live, on TV?</i>


I'll take that as a no.

<i>Well, what it means is that</i>

<i>we're not gonna exploit you
for ratings.</i>

<i>So we're gonna wait...</i> I need the
world to see what's happening here.

Can you do that for me, ma'am?

Can we do that?

<i>Please.</i>

Major Riddick,
are we allowed to go live?

Hey, uh, put the TV on WSB.

to get you two out.</i>

<i>Don't try nothing. Just
stay put until we get there.</i>

<i>Our priority is the protection
of life inside the dwelling.</i>

<i>We're now running a multi-agency
operation to get these hostages out safe.</i>

[interviewer]<i> At what point do you have to change...</i>
Ma'am.

You have
a police officer on air,

but the man who the situation
is about is nowhere to be seen.

Does that make sense to you?
Have you got kids?

You know I do.

<i>Well, then you know why
you called here first.</i>

Why'd I do that?

Because we are not
going to let your children...

Yours and mine...

<i>Watch you blow up that bank
on the air.</i>

[officer on TV] <i>The suspect,
I should say, is workable...</i>

local. Yes, but I cannot confirm that.</i>

<i>And what can you tell us...</i>

So what's it look like
out there?

<i>to do with this outcome.</i>

regarding that at this moment.</i>

They got a lot of people
waiting for me?

[helicopter whirring]

[police radio chatter]

[cell phone buzzes]

Hello?

<i>Cassandra Easley?</i>
Yes.

<i>I'm Agent Jackman of the FBI. Can
you confirm your current address?</i>

[police chatter]
[police dog barks]

other family we could contact?</i>

<i>My brother. But we don't talk.</i>


Hey, everybody.

Riddick, right? Yes,
sir. Real pleasure.

Fine job out here.
Got everything you need?

Yeah, snipers are in place. Area's
clean. Uh, no sign of an accomplice.

Now that Bernard's here,
we're ready to rock and roll.

Good, good. Atlanta's
watching you today, son.

[Brian]<i> Okay, this is good.</i>
No pressure.

what's happening over there...</i>

Let's just give him five more
minutes. Let him wind down.

Lisa...

can I ask you a question?

<i>Sure.</i>

Is life hard for you?

It's hard for everybody I know.
They...

Is it really hard, like...

Seems like everywhere I turn,
they...

You know, my own brother
put a hit out on me.

How did he, uh...

I don't know.
I don't know. They said...

They said he put
20,000 on my head.

Brian, who said that?

The streets is talking.

He a part of some secret
society, some cult like that.

I don't really mess with him,
but they real, real sick people.

Just four kidnapping attempts
on me last year.

You know that? Four.



We gotta stop this.


<i>Uh...</i>

<i>Well...</i>

You know what?

I don't need a translator.

I need to be on the camera.
Can you send somebody down here?

Oh. Well, we have, um...
We have reporters out there.

Mark said that it can work, uh...
You can meet him at a window.

Yeah, we have reporters
out there, uh...

<i>But how would we do it?
Is there a window...</i>

<i>I'm not going near the window.</i>

I do not want to get shot.

Coming through. Coming through!
[person] Hey!

[person 2] Sir!
Stay away from that bank.

Tell your reporters
to stay the fuck off the phone.

You're jeopardizing
his life and yours.

That reporter...
You have been warned.

As you can see, this is
a very volatile situation.

Don't you have a... a long lens that
zoom in that you can see me with?

I'm asking about a long lens.
Oh, long lens. Let me ask.

We're checking on that for you.

<i>Because that's a good idea.
Keep you safe.</i>

prevent that. Hold on.

Major. We haven't even talked to this
guy yet, and you're letting them film him?

What are we doing here?
What is this?

What is what? You're
highly emotional, Sergeant.

Sir, my professional opinion?

This some bullshit.

May I start
a direct line of communication

so someone trained in
this field can talk to him?

trying to divert traffic...</i>

Just push redial.

Yeah, I'm back.

<i>Suspect exits the bank,
he will not leave the sidewalk.</i>

<i>Are you clear on that?</i>

<i>Suspect exits the bank,
he will not leave the sidewalk.</i>

send somebody down here?

Ma'am, ma'am,

I'm not going down there, okay?

I do not wanna get sniped.

Okay, I kinda hear him
talking in the background.

<i>He's still on
with the media, right?</i>

Uh-huh.

We don't play that around here,

I'll tell you that much.

[police chattering]


<i>Brian, calm down.</i>

<i>I need to be on camera, okay?</i>

[engine starts]


[breathing heavily]

Look, they're telling me

that it's just going to take a minute to
locate the camera equipment we need.

But it's coming. Okay?

You're lying.
<i>No, sir.</i>

You're lying to me right now.
I can hear you.

You're lying, I hear it
in your voice. <i>No. No.</i>

You know what,
we're gonna wrap this up.

<i>No, no, no.</i>
We're gonna wrap this up.

<i>Don't do that. Hey...</i>

Wait, my, uh...

God. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

That's all I've been told!

Is to wait!
<i>Brian.</i>

What do I need to do

to get the attention
that I need right now?

Right now!

Right now, ma'am!

Brian. Brian, calm down.

<i>Calm down.</i>
Is this what I need to do?

<i>No. We're gonna...</i>

<i>We're going to take care...</i>
This what I need to do? Okay.

Okay.
[detonator beeping]

Is this what you need?

Is this all the motivation you
need to get me what I need?

You have hostages
in here, ma'am!

Hostages, and they scared!

They scared for their
damn lives! <i>Brian...</i>

I need a phone call!
<i>Brian,</i>

you have my undivided attention.

I don't need
your undivided attention!

I need the attention of the VA!

Not you!

[Riddick] Yeah, we're ready.
[WSB staff] <i>All right. We're gonna do this.</i>

You got it.

Brian...

you get me this phone call?</i>

<i>Hey, Brian...</i> Or do I
have to blow this bitch up?

<i>Brian, they just told me the negotiator wants
to call you on this line, like, right now.</i>

Negotiator
is on the phone, ma'am?

You're not lying to me
right now?

The negotiator is
on the phone? <i>Yeah.</i>

'Cause we can't go back and
forth no more. We can't do that.

No, no, no. So... So... You go talk
to him. And then you call me back.

[detonator continues beeping]

Okay.

[beeping stops]

Okay, that's... that's a start.

That's a start.

Ring him through.
Okay.

Yeah.
She's doing it right now.

I apologize.

[Rosa crying softly]

What are we going to report?

Everything.


<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

a hostage standoff at a Wells Fargo</i>

with Team 2 coverage from
our news chopper in the air,

and a team on the ground.

The suspect made exclusive contact
with our seasoned producer, Lisa Larson.

<i>This is</i> Channel 2 Action News. <i>We
start with Keith James live in Marietta.</i>

We appear to have a
very volatile situation here,

where a man has barricaded
himself inside a bank with...

<i>...an explosive device and a
story that he needs to have told.</i>

<i>Police are no longer calling this a
robbery, rather a hostage situation.</i>

<i>And ten to 15 minutes ago,
the sheriff's SWAT team arrived.</i>

And now to Mark Cavanaugh.</i>

<i>He's live on the other side
of this standoff with police.</i>

<i>Mark, what can you tell us
about the suspect?</i>

<i>Well, I can tell you
the area has been sealed off.</i>

<i>I've also been assured that
the public is not in danger.</i>

<i>Now, the suspect inside that
Wells Fargo told us he's a marine,</i>

<i>and we've worked with several
agencies to confirm that he is in fact</i>

<i>Lance Corporal
Brian Brown-Easley.</i>

Daddy.

Huh?

Larson had with the former marine.</i>

<i>I just want to say...
He's calm and composed</i>

<i>and came across as caring.</i>






Does she look like a Gollum?

[phone rings]

Hello?

<i>Hi, is this Mr. Easley?</i>

<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

<i>This is Eli Bernard, chief
negotiator for Marietta PD.</i>

<i>Damn, they sent me the big dog.</i>

sergeant, but that doesn't matter.</i>

<i>I'm just pleased
to be talking to you.</i>

Why you pleased?

<i>I like to help people.</i>

<i>And it looks like
you can use some help today.</i>

Yeah, you the chief.
Then we good, man.

People know the truth
when they hear it. <i>I do agree.</i>

My mama said show me a liar
and I'll show you a thief.

Right.

<i>- Your mama sound like a smart woman.</i>
Oh, she's smart. She was.

I'm sorry.
<i>No. No sorries.</i>

We all die
at our appointed time.

Yes, we do. So tell me, Brian,
what can I do for you today?

Is it okay if I call you
Brian? <i>Absolutely. Uh...</i>

<i>Sir, I know
you know why I'm here.</i>

<i>And I just simply want
my money back. That's all.</i>

From the VA, right?
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

Yeah, I've had some problems
with Veteran Affairs myself.

It's difficult when they
drag their feet. <i>Right.</i>

<i>Hey, what branch of service
you in?</i>

Marine.

<i>Semper fi, sir.</i>

Where'd you train?

<i>I'm a West Coaster.</i>

<i>MCRD, San Diego.</i>

Okay, okay. So you one
of them Hollywood brothers

with the veneers
in your mouth, huh?

[Bernard laughs]

Shooting bubble gum bullets.

[Bernard laughs]

I'm from St. Louis,
Missouri.

But yes, sir,
a Hollywood marine I am.

<i>So tell me, sir, how can we
put this back in the VA's hands</i>

<i>versus the bank tellers?</i>

send over the cash and fix it.</i>

<i>That's all, okay?</i>

<i>you need help with?</i>

<i>Brian?</i>

Yeah, I need you to help me find the words
to tell my ex-wife and my daughter that...

that I'm gonna die.

<i>Sir, with all due respect,</i>

<i>it is my responsibility to make
sure that you get out of here alive.</i>

Yeah, I understand,

but we both know they
going to kill me, man. They...

We both know I'm dying here.

You know.

Ain't nothing for me out there
but bullets.

At least everybody gonna know.
They gonna know how the VA do, man.

They gonna know.

Everybody will see.

had an ex-wife.</i> [chuckles]

<i>I got one of those
too. Painful.</i> [sniffs]

<i>Anybody else in your life I
can contact?</i> Like a woman?

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>I had but one deep cut in
my life, and I married her.</i>

Well done you, sir.

She beautiful.

Yeah, actually, uh,
I had thought about her...

right at the moment
I decided to do...

what I'm doing right now.

<i>When was that moment, Brian?</i>

[breathing heavily]

[grunts]
[crowd gasps]

[Brian shouting]

Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!


I don't wanna...
I'm not gonna leave!

I'm not leaving until... No!
[handcuffs ratcheting]

No!

I want my cash!

Where's my money?


<i>In front of all those brothers.</i>

I tried to go about it
the way we trained, but...

sir, they've taken
everything from me.

Everything.

I apologize.

<i>For what?</i>

Well, that... that another
human being, a fellow marine,

<i>had to go through so much.</i>

<i>How much money
does the VA owe you?</i>


That it?


worth more than $892.</i>

You're worth more than $892.

I'm worth nothing.

I am nothing.

I'm gonna die tonight...

and nobody will care why.

CNT's up and running.

Let's get you in there
so we can hear y'all.

Look...

This is what we're going to do,
okay? Brother to brother.

I'm gonna call your ex-wife
and daughter.

I'ma tell her that we have talked
and we're going to work this out.

<i>Then I'm going to call you back.</i>

<i>Is that okay?</i>

Okay. <i>Now, after
I've done that, Brian,</i>

<i>I'm gonna need you
to do me a favor.</i>

I'm going to need you
to let one of the ladies go.

Can you do that for me?

<i>Brian, you still there?</i>

What about the cash?
What about the money?

I give my word as a marine
and on my daddy,

you let one of them go,
and we will sort this out.

They're gonna come in that door
and crack my head open.

Ain't nobody coming in there
and cracking open your skull, man.

No. No, no, sir.
Not on my word.

Nigga, please, you don't control these
people, man. You ain't got no power.

Don't do that to me now.
Don't you underestimate me.

Not me.

I'm gonna call your family and
I'll call you back in a moment.

<i>All right?</i>

Okay.

[busy signal beeps]

Don't you ever, ever disrespect
me or cut me off when I'm talking, sir!

Give me the ex-wife's number.

[reporter on radio] <i>A man has
taken over a Wells Fargo bank</i>

<i>and is threatening
to blow it up.</i>

<i>He apparently has an explosive,
some sort of backpack or package...</i>

[cell phone buzzes]

Hello? [Bernard]
<i>Hello, Ms. Easley.</i>

<i>I'm Sergeant Bernard from
the Marietta Police Depart...</i>

Is he dead?

<i>No. No, ma'am.</i>

<i>No, Brian is still
very much alive.</i>

<i>Say, you got Face Time?</i>

Yeah.
<i>I just want you to see me.</i>

Uh, yeah, I do. I do. I do.
Hold on.

<i>Okay, good.</i>

I am pressin' that button...

right about... now.

<i>Hi.</i>

I gotta tell you, I'm not too
much for all this technology,

but let's just say
it's a pleasure to see you.

Yeah.

<i>First of all, I want to let
you and your daughter know</i>

<i>I do this day in and day out, and I
know a good man when I see one.</i>

<i>Your husband's a good man.</i>

Yeah. Yeah, I know that. I know that.
He wouldn't... He wouldn't hurt a spider.

<i>He has these episodes,
sometimes,</i>

<i>but nothing like this,
nothing this bad.</i>

Has he ever been violent
towards you or your daughter?

<i>Violent? No. No. Hell, no. He
loves that child with his whole heart.</i>

<i>That's good to know.</i>

<i>And before I go, is there
anything I can help you with?</i>

Yeah. Yeah, you can tell me why
the FBI is on their way to my house.

I didn't... I didn't...
I didn't do anything wrong.

I apologize, ma'am.
That's just procedure.

This here's my number.

If they do anything you
don't like, you just call me.

Make sense?

<i>Yeah, it does.</i>

<i>Is there anything
you want me to tell Brian?</i>

Yeah.

Yeah, tell him that I...

Tell him that Kiah says,
"Don't do nothing stupid."

<i>Okay, ma'am.</i>

<i>I'll make sure
to pass that along.</i>

All right. Thank you.

<i>You're welcome.
Bye now.</i>

cameras live any moment now.</i>

[officer 2]<i> All units, suspect does
not leave the perimeter with the bomb.</i>

[phone rings]

<i>I spoke to your ex-wife, man.</i>

We actually video talked, but...
<i>Good, you did?</i>

She's a lovely lady.

<i>They okay?</i>

She and your daughter
are doing just fine.

<i>Told Cassandra she can call me
if she needs anything.</i>

That's mighty fine of you.
Did you call the VA too?

<i>To tell the truth,
that's going to take some time.</i>

But I did
what I said I was going to do,

so, how about you release
one of those ladies?

I'ma release both of them
when the money's in my account.

I was really clear.
<i>You gave me your word, marine.</i>

Now don't do that.
Do not do that.

I did not reply, sir.

Now, you got me there.
<i>Okay.</i>

It's just, uh,

<i>I care about you, Brian.</i>

<i>I care about you
just as much as I care about</i>

<i>what them ladies
must be going through.</i>

<i>you're good at your job.</i>

<i>But I need you to go do it.
Just call the VA.</i>

<i>10% to 50% disability. Right?</i>

How you know that?

Well, the VA just
sent over your file.

<i>You were hurt in Iraqi Freedom.</i>


<i>getting shot in the heat.</i>

<i>You... You were shot, right?</i>

No, I was injured.

I was. Which means
you're just like me.

<i>You've been through worse.</i>

<i>You just gotta push through,
Brian. I'll be here to help.</i>

I understand
that you having conversations

that you're supposed to be having
with the VA, but what you need to do,

rather than trying to
straighten me out,

<i>is call them,
then have them call me.</i>

Because you know what you did?
You gave me your word, sir.

You did that.

So if that isn't the conversation,
then we don't need to talk.

<i>Come on, Brian.</i>

They taught us better than this.

No, no, no, no. <i>We can
fix this. This is human error.</i>

I'm gonna die
because of that human error.

Sleep on that.

Shit.


[cell phone buzzes]

answer that. It's Brian.

There'll be a moment
when you can. Just not now.

Hold on, baby.

[buzzing continues]

[tosses phone]

Come here.

I understand he is a local,
but I cannot confirm that.

[line ringing]

<i>Hi, this is Cassandra Deets...</i>

[phone rings]

<i>Don't put the phone down.</i>

Since you didn't let those ladies out, you
can at least let me speak to one of them.

Hold on.

Negotiator wants to talk.

Estel.

Hello.

<i>Hi, who am I speaking with?</i>

Estel Valerie.
<i>Hello, Ms. Valerie.</i>

This is Sergeant Bernard.
Is everyone all right in there?

[smacks lips]
No, we are not.

What are you people
doing out there?

<i>Ma'am, we're doing
everything we possibly can</i>

<i>to get y'all out of there
safely.</i>

Well, how long does it take to
put money into a man's account?

Estel, just please
try to stay calm.

I'm perfectly calm.

<i>Okay. We're trying, ma'am.</i>

Well, try harder, please.

[phone rings]

WSB-TV tip-line. This is
Lisa Larson. What's your tip?

Absolutely.
Uh, what is your address?

<i>The remaining feed is up now.</i>

Can you put Brian
back on the phone, please?


I'm about to leave this car
and go over to the van.

When I'm out there,
is there anything you'd like?

Maybe some smokes?

Okay. I can do that.

<i>What kind do you like?</i>

Newports. Newport Longs.

Brian,
when I buy these cigarettes,

someone is going to have to
leave them at the door for you.

We got a plan for that?

<i>Can't you do it?</i>

Okay.

You give me a few minutes to buy those
cigarettes, and I... I'll meet you there.

[hangs up receiver]

That's some bullshit.

I ain't going near that.

You know what,

they're not going to fix it.

I will.

I'm going to put your money
directly into your account.

That's not what I need to
happen. So, no, thank you.

Money is money.

Why you care about
where it comes from?

If I cared about the money, I'd have had
you do that when I walked in, but I didn't.

So, no, I do not need that.

You think the VA
got their own printed money?

We're the bank.

We get it back.

No.

I want their money.

So you set on dying?

How many times I gotta
hide my son from the news?

I'll tell you what.

When he asks me, "What did
you do to stop him from dying?"

I'm gonna look him in the eye...

and know that I tried.


you're owed into your account,

and let's please go home.

Look, you can bump it
to your... your wife.

Or your daughter.

I don't care,
but I need you not to die.

Okay, Brian?

Brian, I need you not to die.

Not today.

Okay.

I'm gonna handle this. Right?

I should probably...

If I'm gonna
leave her something,

I should probably call
Kiah, right? Mm-hmm.

You need some credit
on... on the phone?

Yes, ma'am, I do.
Okay. That's on me.

Okay.
I'ma need that number, okay?

Estel might be losing it.

I reckon she's going to take
matters into her own hands.

Okay, well, that's a problem.

We still got her
on the phone, right?

Why is that a problem?

If he finds out

that she put the money
in his account and not the VA,

it just might trigger him.

We don't know.

Hell, he doesn't know.

Whoever is talking to her
should tell her to stop.

In fact, we should kill all bank
communications except for the phones.

except for the phones.

Let's go.

[typing on keyboard]

I got the phone credit,
but your account...

it's erroring.

Why... Why would they do that?
It just doesn't work?

Try again.

[phone rings]

Hello.

Man, why would you...
Brian, look at your phone, man.

You're on CNN.

CNN?

I'm on CNN?

<i>People are listening
to your story.</i>

They got pictures of you
all over Facebook and Twitter.

Mm-hmm.

Okay, uh, what they saying?

know that you're angry.</i>

<i>Hell, most of them know
what's behind it.</i>

<i>It ain't no secret
that the VA is fubar.</i>

<i>You got them
on the back foot now, brother.</i>

<i>You hear me?</i>

So everything you say,

everything you do,

it matters.

<i>I don't know that it does.</i>

<i>It matters. You matter.</i>

where you are right now.</i>

Thank you for the call,
Hollywood.


One of y'all can go.

that he owed the college money.</i>

though it says it is.


Once a student wants out,
stops showing up,

school tells us
they're defaulting.

Meaning what?
We gotta take their money.

Pension, disability,
whatever we can get.

The kicker is,
that wasn't Brian.

This is on them.

Why didn't the VA make it right?

Give me a pack
of the Newport Longs.

6.50.

Uh, you got matches?

All right, listen up!

Prepare for a hostage release.

Got ourselves a swap.

Got a light?

Got matches?

I know you got a light.

Does anybody have a light?

Why don't you, uh, give him
a blowtorch while you're at it?

He has a detonator
attached to a bomb, sir.

Not a stick of dynamite.

SWAT command, let me know
when you're ready for hostage release.

SWAT prepare for the exchange.</i>

Guys! Hey, guys!


Now, ladies, we don't have
much time. You have to decide.

You can't put that on us. It's not fair.
I know.

Rosa, you can go. Go.

No.

Cannot leave you here.


You got to decide.
I'm...

Well, I think it's probably best
I have a senior manager here,

you know, in case they try to...

They try to shoot me.

As soon as the cigarettes
are at the door,

all three of us will go get it.

Estel, I need you to open
the door, hold it open.

And, Rosa, I need you to grab
the cigarettes, pass it on back,

move off.

Then, Estel,
you lock the door behind her.

That clear?

Okay.

Good.

You hot?

Not really.

No?

I think I'm burning up.
Excuse me.

Come on.

Come on. Let's go.

We got to go.

We got to go.

You gotta be kidding me.

[line ringing]


Hey, Baby Ruth.
Hey. Hey, baby.

I just wanted to let you know
that I'm gonna be okay.

You know, whatever happens...

and you gonna be okay.

<i>My baby gonna be fine.</i>

Am I?

Baby, why would you not be?

You don't understand. You're
the most brilliant person I know.

<i>Yeah.</i>

But Mommy says you in trouble.

Well, tell Mommy...

Tell Mommy
I'll be just fine. Okay?

<i>Now, you know what we do.</i>

Can you pray with Daddy?

If he comes back out,
he will shoot me.

If he had a gun,
we would have seen it by now.

Rosa. Rosa.

Rosa, come on.

I can't.
You the one supposed to be free.

Bitch, come on.

I can't move.

What the hell
is taking SWAT so long?

They'll let us know
when they're set.

"Those that dwell...

in the shelter
of the Most High...

<i>shall rest...</i>

shall rest..."



Okay, baby.



"I will say of the Lord...

He is my refuge...

my fortress...

my God, in whom I trust.

Surely he will save me
from the fowler's snare...

and from the deadly pestilence."

Amen.


<i>Daddy...</i>

<i>are you breathing?</i>

I am, baby.

I'm breathing.

I am.

Thank you for your prayer.

Thank you
for praying for me, baby.

I needed that.

<i>Daddy,</i>

can you get out of trouble?

<i>Oh, baby, you can always get...</i>

Just do right by people.

You understand me? Wherever

What was that?
I think it was a rescue.

Who authorized the rescue, Chief?
You had hostages in there.

Find out what that was.
Was that a flash-bang?

Where are the hostages, Chief?

You said you wanted a peaceful
negotiation. What happened?

Look, we saw
a window of opportunity

and we made contact
trying to extract the hostages.

Did you kill him?

I have no further comment
on this matter.

When will that information
be available?

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

Thank you.

We're on our way.

Excuse me.
Excuse me!

Is he dead?

You'll have to contact
your local PD, ma'am.


Hello? I have to what?

Sir!

Excuse me, please.
Talk to me, sir.

Just talk to me.
Ma'am.

Ma'am. Ma'am.
Did you kill him?

Ma'am. Ma'am!

You'll find he may have
turned the weapon on himself.
