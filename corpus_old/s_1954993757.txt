Hey, Wally? Take a look at these,
will you? I've made some changes.

<i>Hi. Leave a message at the beep
and we'll get back to you.</i>

<i>Hi, honey. It's me.</i>

Too bad you're going away
this weekend. I miss you already.

<i>But I'll tell you what.
Why don't I knock off early...</i>

<i>and I come home for lunch
and see you off, okay?</i>

<i>Love you.</i>

Terrific.

-Boss, you've got a visitor.
-Clint.

Hope you don't mind
me popping in like this.

Oh, no.
I'm always glad to see you.

Wally, give us
a couple of minutes, will you?

-Have a seat.
-Thanks.

Shut up.

Problem, sheriff?

There ain't but two people in this
whole town worth going fishing with.

I'm looking at one and
you're looking at the other one.

-What you're weekend like?
-I'm wide open.

Joanna's heading to the city today.
Spending the night with a girlfriend.

-Going shopping tomorrow.
-Well, we'll make the night too.

Let's get some fishing poles
and sleeping bags...

-and catch some trouts.
-You got it.

I'll pick you up at five.

Big hand is on the twelve,
little hand is on the five.

You can't miss it.

Slow it down!

What are you doing in there, Duke?
Nobody let you out?

Come here. Come here.

Yeah. Come on. Come on.

Go get it. Go get it.

That's it.
Stay out of those flowers.

<i>Honey, I'm home!</i>

Honey?

-Did you get my message?
-Yes...

but I have doctor
appointment at two...

and then I'm
meeting Maggie. And if...

If I don't head into the city now,
I'll never make it, so...

Well, guess I'll just
have to fend for myself.

I guess so.

Oh, that's okay.

But if you try to call me tonight
and I'm not here...

I want you to know the truth.

Sam and I are going fishing.

Yeah, the knife's been invented.

You'll never guess
who came by again today.

Bill Scorby.
Made another offer.

A million and a half.

Well, he's persistent.
I'll say that about him.

If he wasn't so damn sleazy,
I would kind of find it flattering.

It's an awful lot of money,
sweetheart. I mean...

maybe we should consider it.

I would sooner sell
the business to the dog.

Besides, who's looking
for a buyer?

What would we do
if we sold the business?

We'll get the hell out of here.
We can go back to New York.

-You ever think about that?
-Joanna.

You ever think about
taking your old job back?

-Wait a second.
-Do you ever think about me?

I have done nothing
but to think about you.

Do you think I left you alone
in New York for five summers...

and traveled two thousand miles
so I can come here and fish?

No. I've built this house for us.

This was our
dream house, remember?

Away from all that craziness.
Quiet, fresh air.

A place where we could
raise our kids.

Clint, we've been trying
for over an year and a half...

and I'm still not pregnant.

We'll just keep trying.
It will happen.

-I want out of here.
-Joanna, we had an agreement.

You said you would
give this town a chance.

Come on, this is where I grew up.
This is my home.

I want this to be our home.

I've built this house
because I love you.

This? You know what this is?

One big maze. And I'm the rat.

Don't make it sound
like I dragged you here.

Well, that's how it feels,
sweetheart.

I have to go.

Have a fun date.

-We don't do this enough anymore.
-No, we don't.

So, how are things
on the home front?

They're okay.

Forget I asked.
It's none of my business.

Well, you know Joanna.

She grew up in the city.

So the transition hasn't been
easy for her, but she's trying.

That's enough for now.

-This answer your question?
-Yeap.

I can't tell you how surprise
we were to see you come back.

-How glad we were.
-Yeah, sure.

-I mean it.
-Well...

New York city? Ten years?

The only wood I get my hands on
was a pencil between my fingers.

I had to come back.

She'll come around, Sam.

-I know she will.
-I hope so.

You and me.

Together we'll own 20% of the most
exclusive clinic on Beverly Hills.

You'll be on
a first name basis...

with every movie star,
producers and all in town.

All of them with
substance abuse problems.

All of them willing to pay me
500 bucks for an office visit.

I'll leave him.
I'll get a divorce.

Joanna, we're looking at
a year in court.

Maybe more.

And who is to say
what you'll end up with.

This clinic is a cash machine
just waiting for us to plug into it.

You want that as much as I do.
I know you do.

Cort, please.

Look, maybe
you loved Clint once...

but you end up there.

Right in that county in USA,
sitting in the front porch...

watching the peasants puke.

That's not
what you deserve, is it?

No.

I can make this happen.

All it takes is money.
And it's easier than you think.

-How easy?
-Did you enjoy your dinner tonight?

Yes.

Did you notice anything
missing in the aquarium?

We ate one of those?

In the Orient,
these are a great delicacy.

Extremely difficult to prepare.

If I've made the tiniest slip, we
wouldn't be alive to talk about it.

I extracted this from
the ovaries of the fish we ate.

This it a toxin.

-How does it work?
-The recipient has a cardiac arrest.

Quick and clean.

It's almost tasteless.
You can...

You can put it in his food.
Put in the drink. Whatever.

I never knew a murder
could be so pure.

Pure.

I like that.

Make sure he takes all of it.

Understand? All of it.

I can't do this.

You're asking too much. I...

-I won't.
-You don't mean that.

I'm sorry.

So am I. I only wanted
what was best for you, Joanna.

-Will I see you again?
-I don't...

think that would be fair.
To either of us.

Do you?

No.

I hope it all works out
for you, Joanna. I really do.

Okay.

Okay.

Honey, I'm home.

<i>-Joanna?
-Upstairs.</i>

Honey, you have to see
all these trout.

Talking dinner for days.

Dinner can wait, can't it?

Yeah, I think so.

I love you.

Well, here I was ready to
role up my sleeves.

-Clean some fish.
-I thought we had steak tonight.

I had fish last night.

Do you need any help?

-No?
-No, that's okay.

-Well, I'll be at the workshop.
-Okay.

It's about time...

-You scared me.
-I'm sorry.

I did it again.

Now, you didn't cook
all this food just for me.

I don't know where
my appetite went.

-I want to propose a toast.
-What?

A toast.

Sweetheart, you know,
I had some wine earlier and I...

I'm just not feeling very well.

Joanna, just toast with me.
Please.

Come on.

Yeah.

To you, Joanna.

Everytime I look at you...

I don't know how I got so lucky.

Sweetheart.

Honey, please.
You're hurting me.

Joanna...

Joanna, help me.

Joanna...

No!

Die.

Why don't you just die?

Damn you, die! Die!

<i>-Hello?
-It's me.</i>

<i>-Joanna?
-It's done.</i>

<i>-What?
-It's done.</i>

<i>I see. Now, listen,
just stay calm.</i>

<i>You've already done
the right thing.</i>

<i>-What is that?
-You called your doctor.</i>

<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

Alright.

Don't seem right a man
this prime having a heart attack.

-I don't understand it.
-A case like this is always a chock.

But they happen
more often than you know.

A man as healthy...

A man as seemingly healthy...

as Mr. Goodman seldom
exhibit symptoms beforehand.

This is such a waste.

-Look.
-What?

The dog. Can't somebody
please make that dog shut up?

He's just upset
like all of us, Joanna.

I'll take him of your hands
if you like. Until after...

Until things settle down.

Coroner.

What about an autopsy?

I don't think that's necessary,
but I'll defer to the coroner.

-I see no reason for it, Sam.
-Alright.

-Sheriff.
-What?

-Death certificate.
-We're just about done here, Sam.

Alright.

Thanks.

-I'm truly sorry about this, Joanna.
-Thank you, Sam. That means a lot.

You're trying to give me
a heart attack too?

Made it all sound
so neat and simple!

-Joanna, keep your voice down.
-Well, it wasn't!

It took forever. It was horrible.
You should've seen him.

Look, Joanna, this is a very
tense moment for the both of us...

but let's just
get a grip here, alright?

We can't afford
to get sloopy now.

We have a ways to go
before we're out of the woods.

-It's over. It's done.
-You have business arrangements.

-You have a funeral. You have a wake.
-No. No wake.

-Joanna...
-Not after what I've been through.

You're gonna be alright?

Yeah, fine. Thanks, doctor.

You've got to relax.
You've got to keep it together.

And you've got to think straight.

You understand that?

I love you, baby. And we'll get
through this somehow, okay?

And if there's anything else
that you need, Ms. Goodman.

Anything at all.
Fell free to call me.

Anytime of the day or night.
That's what I'm here for.

-Thank you, doctor.
-You're very welcome.

Joanna, Helen and I
are here for you.

Anything you need. Alright?

Thank you, Sam.

That girl is very destroyed.
She's devastated.

I thought you handled yourself
very well in there.

-If you don't mind my saying so.
-Not at all. Thanks.

-Alright. Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

Stop. I mean it now.
Come on, Duke.

Come on.

Come on, this way. Right here.

Sam, it late. Come to bed.

In a minute.

You shouldn't be
drinking beer at this hour.

You'll be in and out the bed
through all night long.

I'm only drinking a half a bottle.
That'll help me sleep.

-Split it with me.
-I'll take a sip.

Take two.

I was just thinking about the way
he was after his parents died.

Damned pimply kid
was always in trouble.

-You set him straight.
-I sure did.

I put a fear of God
into that boy.

Turned out to be
a fine young man.

Sometimes life just comes along and
kicks you when you don't expect it.

And just knocks the wind
right out of you.

I just can't believe
that he's gone.

Well, there he is.
Bagged and tagged.

Now he's gotta be
pumped and dumped.

First day jitters?

You'll get used to it.

After a while,
they all look the same.

Stiff.

Well, help me peel it.

Quintan Funeral Home.
Quintan speaking.

Yes, Dr. Van Owen.
How can I be of service?

Are you sure?

People often regret
that decision later.

Be that as it may.
Ms. Goodman is very specific.

She does not want a wake.

Now, first, you've got
to get familiar with the tools.

Now, this here, little sharp knife.
This is a scalpel.

Now, over here, we have
a pourer fluid injection system.

Manufactured in Urbana, Illinois.

Now this little baby pumps the
embalming fluid into these holes.

Right here.

While we drain the blood out
through this hose right here.

You ever changed
the oil in your car?

Same thing.

Now, stay with me, boy.

The big artery is right here.

Reflex action.

-Happens all the time.
-Are you sure?

Hell, I once had one set both
arms up and try to go for a coffee.

Now we just make
the incision right here.

-Hell.
-Earl?

Never mind the juice. This one
goes in the ground this afternoon.

They went cheap on us.
No wake, no deal.

Even set up his own suit
to bury him in.

Use that pine cast
at the workshop.

The water damaged one?

Sure, just slipe
a coat of varnish on it.

Why waste a showroom model?

We're not gonna make
a deadly squad on this job anyway.

How is that new kid working up?

Fine.

Just fine.

May the Lord claims our
departed brother in repentance...

for as the good book says...

"The night is far spent,
the day is at hand.

Let us therefore cast off
the works of darkness...

and let us put on
the armor of light.

For whether we live,
we live unto the Lord...

and whether we die,
we die unto the Lord."

We now command
Clint Goodman soul to almighty God.

<i>Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.</i>

<i>For dust thou art,
and dust thou shalt return.</i>

-I wanna make a toast.
-No, no toasts.

Come on. I wanna make a toast.
Here, come on.

To my beautiful darling.

The grieving widow.
What a performance.

-Here.
-Cheers.

Who was that old lady
that you threw your arms around?

In a paroxysm of grief.
Who was that?

I have no idea.

-That's it.
-What?

I've had it with that dog.

Dog? Forget the dog.

Forget the dog.

Now, come on. Forget the dog.

-Is that a gun?
-Well, it ain't a can of apo.

What are you doing?

Heyi, Duke!

-What?
-What a good boy!

Stay.

Damn! I've missed!

Are you nuts?

Wait. Come here! Come here!

You're crazy.

Go.

Go!

Yeah.

-What do you got?
-We have boiled chicken.

No.

-Strawberries.
-Oh yeah.

There's somebody at the window.

-It's the dog.
-What?

It's the dog

The dog.

There are no leans or claims
on your joint assets, Ms. Goodman.

This contains your
husband's crucial documents.

Bank accounts, CD's
and so far.

Now, as to the disposition
of the business...

I believe there's a Mr. Bill Scorby
interested in buying it.

Yes, I know Bill.

If you want, I'll give him
a call right now.

Please.

I understand that his offer
stands at a million and a half.

I'm willing to accept, if payment
can be made within 48 hours.

In cash.

Yeah.

Honey, I'm home.

-Sam.
-Just thought I'd stop by...

-and see how you're doing.
-That's very kind of you.

-Would you like to come in?
-Thanks. I can't stay long though.

Can I get you something to drink?
Some coffee?

No, thanks. But I wouldn't
turn down something cold.

How about a beer?

Not when I'm on duty
but thanks anyway.

-I have soda. Do you want a diet?
-Why bother?

I didn't mean that...

-I didn't mean anything.
-No problem. I'm used to it.

I remember when Clint
was building this house.

Did it with his bare hands.

He had a real relationship
with wood, that man.

Sometimes I think he was happy
picking splinters out of his fingers.

I notice the
"For sale" sign out front.

The place seems so big
now that Clint is gone.

There's too many memories.

I hear you're selling
the business too.

I wouldn't know the first thing
about running a business.

I think you're doing
the right thing.

I'm sure Clint would've
wanted to see it go to Bill.

I like to think so. I mean,
Clint always spoke so highly of Bill.

So you'll be leaving town?

We'll miss you.

That rainstorm really kicked up
some mud last night.

Yes, it did.

Sheriff, you're
making me look bad.

You're spending more time
with my patient than I am.

I wouldn't know about that, doc.

I better say goodbye.
I've gotta be on my way.

Cort...

So...

-what did the sheriff have to say?
-He asked me all kinds of questions.

When am I leaving town,
am I selling the house.

I see.

<i>Did you thank him
for his concern?</i>

<i>He even knew I was
selling the business two hours...</i>

<i>after I walked out
the lawyer's office.</i>

-Let's leave tonight.
-Honey, honey.

Right now.

Hey, you're shaking.

If you're worried about the
country boy with a badge, don't be.

I mean it, Cort. I cashed all
the accounts today. Let's just go.

<i>The real money comes tomorrow
when you sell the business.</i>

<i>-We need that money for the clinic.
-Cort, please.</i>

Now, look. You listen to me.

<i>All you have to do is hang in
with me on more night.</i>

<i>And before you know it...</i>

we'll be in Beverly Hills
sipping margaritas by the pool.

-Did we do the right thing?
-We did the only thing.

All he ever saw was
flapjacks and babies.

<i>Getting you pregnant was probably
the best thing he ever did.</i>

If it wasn't for that, you never
would've come into my life.

And I took care of that
problem for you, didn't I?

Yes.

<i>Like I'm gonna take care of all
of your problems from now on.</i>

<i>-You know I'm right.
-Yes, you're right.</i>

No.

That's too easy.

Sra. Goodman, I believe
we have an appointment.

Would you like to count it?

No. I'm sure it's all there.

Sra. Goodman, I just want to say
how bad I feel about Clint's passing.

Getting the business this way...

I'm sorry. What?

You'll get over it, dear.
Just takes time.

Yes.

Can I see you out?

Thank you. Thank you.

Goodbye.

Yes!

The whole damn thing
is a disgrace.

First that wife of his puts
him under pretty damn quick.

We didn't even
have time to embalm him.

And now this.

This is how I found it.
I didn't touch a thing.

-What happened here?
-I don't know, sheriff.

Looks to me like
somebody dug him up.

Jesus Christ.

This could ruin me
over night if word got out.

Is there anyway
we can keep this quiet?

Dig up the coffin and take it
to my home, not to the station.

Then come back and fill
the hole in and cover it all up.

And don't say this to anybody.
I don't want any questions...

until after I finish
my investigation. You understand?

It's a hell of a thing when
they start stealing bodies...

right out of the ground.

Who would do a thing like this,
that's what I've like to know.

So would I.

<i>-Hello.
-I need you over here right now.</i>

<i>The doctor's not in, but leave a
message at the sound of the bip...</i>

<i>I'll return your call as soon
as possible. Bye for now.</i>

<i>Cortland, take up the phone.</i>

<i>Someone's been in the house.
He may still be here.</i>

You better be on your way.

Please, Cortland.

My God.

Duke.

You're very good dog.

Yes, you are.

Stay.

Okay. Stay.

Okay.

Let me just...
Stay there.

Well, Joanna.
Don't ask me what is this.

How are my beautiful girls?

You love your daddy, don't you?

Yes, you do.

And your daddy love you.

<i># So make it one for my baby
# And one more for the road</i>

<i># You wouldn't know it
# But I'm a kind of poet</i>

<i># And I've got
# A lot of things to say</i>

<i>Dr. Van Owen, you are now
six months behind on the rent.</i>

<i>And you've ignored
three eviction notices.</i>

<i>I'm coming by on Monday with a
federal marshal and a court order...</i>

<i>to have you physically
removed from the property.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, but you've left me
no choice in this matter.</i>

<i>Cortland, take up the phone.</i>

<i>Someone's been in the house.
He may still be here.</i>

<i>You better be on your way.</i>

Joanna?

Joanna, darling?

Joanna?

Hey, baby.

It never would
have worked, darling.

Too much of a slob.

<i>Joanna?</i>

<i>Joanna? Joanna?</i>

<i>-Cortland?
-It's time we have a little talk.</i>

I would rather blow
your brains out.

Joanna?

Joanna?

Joanna, you can come out now.

Sweetheart?

I'm starting to get
real annoyed here.

No!

<i>No!</i>

I'm sorry.

-Are you alright?
-Are you crazy?

-Why did you hit me?
-I thought you were...

-When you came down here, I...
-What?

I thought you were him.

Somebody knows?

-Who is it?
-I don't know.

But he's locked us down here.

Did you see him?
What did he look like?

He was wearing a mask.
Like a welder's thing.

I couldn't see his face.

I think I shot him.
Maybe he's wounded.

He sounds pretty healthy to me.

He's moving the furniture.

I planned it so carefully.
Every last detail.

And some lunatic comes along and
starts playing interior decorator.

Joanna, who did you tell?

-I didn't tell anybody.
-Are you sure?

Of course I'm sure. You think
I took an ad from the paper?

-I thought that was you.
-You thought that...?

You thought that
I came to hurt you?

Joanna, how could you think that?

-I love you.
-I'm sorry.

You're sorry?

Here.

You want me to burn this?

-I'll burn it right now.
-What are you talking about?

I'll burn the whole thing.

Everything I did, I did for you.

I love you.
Joanna, hell, I'd die for you.

Sweetheart, I didn't know.

I didn't know. I'm sorry.

-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-It's alright. It's alright.

-What are we going to do?
-We're going to get out of here.

Right now.

Alright.

Alright.
Stand back, stand back.

Alright.

Wait.

What?

What is it?

-These are blanks.
-What?

They're blanks. Somebody's cut off
the ends and put out the pillars.

These are nothing but
gunpowder and air.

Who are you?

Alright. Alright.

That's clever. Very clever.

Well leave here
in about thirty seconds.

-It nearly took my face off.
-We're stucked down here.

This is great.
This is just great.

We've got Jason upstairs
and Cujo in the front yard.

And I'm having a real good time.

You've got a serious
attitude problem, pal!

Talk to me!

Honey, you don't like the house?
I can always remodel.

-What?
-Listen.

-What?
-It's quiet.

-How long we've been down here?
-About eight hours.

Feels like a month.

I have this figured it out.

I know who it is.

-Who?
-It sounds farfetched.

You won't believe this.

-Who?
-Your redneck sheriff.

-Sam?
-Who else could it be?

-Who else could've figured it out?
-Why hasn't he arrested us?

You don't get it.

There isn't going to be an arrest.

He wants a piece.

Maybe he wants
the whole damn pie.

I underestimated him.

He's not as dumb as he looks.

-But it's gonna cost him.
-What do you mean?

I'm going to rip out his heart
and shove it down his throat.

And I'm gonna laugh
when he chokes of it.

Yes, indeed.

I'm going to rip his heart out
with my bare hands.

And I'm gonna enjoy that.

Sooner or later he's gonna
have to open that door.

And he's gonna have
to make his terms known.

And whatever they are, I'll agree
to them. Nice and friendly.

With a big smile on my face.

Cooperating every inch
of the way.

"Happy to do business with you.

Whatever you want, pal.
Whatever you say.

Just name it, it's yours.
No problem here."

And when we're finally
feeling all warm and charity...

and he gets close enough
to take that money...

I'm going to beat him
to death with the shotgun.

And then I'm gonna dance
out of here. As free as you please.

I'd like you to burn
the money now.

-What are you talking about?
-To prove how much you love me.

Burn it all right now.

-You were ready to do it before.
-This is our ticket out of here.

-Think for a moment.
-You love me?

-Yes, I love you.
-You'd die for me?

You know I would.

Here's your chance, you bastard.

No!

Wait a minute here.

You had this planned
from the start, didn't you?

Was never about me.
You used me.

now you want that clinic
all to yourself.

There never was a clinic,
you dumb bitch.

No, baby. I'm booked on
a one-way flight to the Tropics.

I'm gonna seat on the beach earning
18% while I diddle the locals...

and maybe, just maybe
I'll get off for a change.

Come here.

I'm not gonna lie here, darling.
This is really gonna hurt.

Well? You're gonna
waste that on me?

No.

No.

-This is for him.
-Good.

-Go on.
-What?

-Go on.
-You go.

Come on.

-Come on, go on.
-You make me sick.

Hello?

Looks like we're gonna
work this thing out.

Come on, darling.
Turn on the light.

It's not here.

-The light?
-The dining room

The front door was here,
wasn't it?

Yes.

Look, I can tell that you're not
ready to discuss this seriously.

So I'll tell you what, you let
me know when you are ready...

and we'll be in the basement.

Damn it. Damn it.

-Joanna?
-I'm right here.

Look, we're here to negotiate.
In good faith.

And you're making me angry.

Fine. Let's seat in the living room,
seat on the couch...

put our feet up,
discuss this man to man.

I want to get out! Damn it!

Stop it.

Just stop it!

-What?
-I said stop it.

Look...

let's go fifty, fifty here, pal?
What do you say?

It doesn't get
any fairer than that.

Come on, talk to me! Please?

Look...

She's the one you want.

-She killed him.
-It was his idea!

Shut up.

You didn't have the guts
to do your own dirty work.

-You filthy coward.
-That's it!

Cort!

Cort!

Cort?

That's good. That's good.
That's clever.

That's very clever.
Cut her out entirely.

I mean, it's my thinking exactly.

Fine. Alright.

That window is sure
is a squid side.

I don't mind telling you.

I bet I know how to buy
my way through it.

Well, here it is.

Fifty, fifty.

Well...

sixty, forty.

Seventy, thirty.
It doesn't get fairer than that.

I'll tell you what.

It's yours.

Every dime, okay?

I mean, this is it.
This is my final offer.

I just want out of here, Sam.

Okay?

Please.

Sam.

Keep it.

Cort?

Please, why are you
doing this to me?

Like a rat in a maze.
Remember?

Clint.

Our child, Joanna...

was it a boy or a girl?

I suppose it doesn't matter.

No!

No!

Duke.

This is Sheriff Eberly.
We've got a 904 in progress.

I don't know. Better get
the fire department out here.

Put more water pressure, please.

-Well?
-There's nobody in there.

-Nobody?
-We searched from one end...

to the other. Nothing.

If you're looking for corpses,
you're looking in the wrong place.

Chilly today.
Should've worn my top coat.

I came to pay my respects
to a friend, he's buried here.

Did you know him?

No.

Died last week. Died suddenly.

I never...

Never had the chance to tell
him how much our friendship...

really meant to me.

Maybe he knows.

Hey, mister?

I don't know who you are,
but don't come back here.

Ever.
