A robin in a cage
calls the wrath of heaven ...

Can not you even be serious?

I have to laugh.

No, I think it's not boring.
I just do not know how to unravel it.

This is poetry, you nerd
No dry physics.

Did you just "nerd"

the Predictable. When light for example.

We know exactly what happened,
when sodium nitrate meets water. Boom!

But no, the turbulence
Qualms of the previously calculated.

Since she has misunderstood what.
But she already understands that some people

for their livelihood
have to work. - Now is time well.

My goodness,
sometimes you're something of stubborn.

What should I do
so are you satisfied?

I want you to stay here.
With me. Just this once.

You know my family
I must go there.

Einstein's universe
is a universe of order,

in principle, everything is predictable
Whereas Heisenberg theorized,

the world is chaotic by nature
and ultimately not predictable.

Your missing me terribly.

You're also soon end, yes?

So then I wish you a nice
Thanksgiving. - I wish you well, Greg.
