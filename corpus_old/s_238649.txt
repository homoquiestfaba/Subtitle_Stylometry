A TEENAGE
GIRL FALLS SIX STORIES,
THEN WALKS AWAY UNSCATHED.

A MAN BURSTS INTO FLAMES
WITH NO SIGNS OF BURNS.

ONE THING'S FOR SURE:
IT'S GETTING WEIRDER
OUT THERE EVERY DAY.

BUT THE TRUTH IS SPOKEN HERE.

HELP ME.

WHAT?

SMILE, LOSER.

NO NEED TO RUN ANYMORE, EMMA.

YOU'RE AMONG FRIENDS.

HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

WAIT, WHAT'S GOING ON?

ALL YOUR QUESTIONS
WILL BE ANSWERED.

RIGHT NOW, TIME TO GO.

CHECK OUT THESE SHOTS, ADAM.

TERRIFIC. UPLINK
TO SANCTUARY DATABASE.

SHALIMAR, JESSE, GREAT WORK.

WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME
WHO THE HELL YOU GUYS ARE AND

WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

SORRY, EMMA. I'M ADAM.

AND THIS IS MUTANT X.

EMMA, YOUR ASSAILANTS
WERE MEMBERS OF A
SECURITY WING OF GENOME X,

A BIOTECH FIRM
WHICH IS ACTUALLY A SECRET
BRANCH OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE.

NOW THIS IS
A VISUAL CLOAK AND...

PLEASE DON'T PANIC.

I CAN'T SEE.

IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

SO, WHY DO
THEY CARE ABOUT ME?

IT'S YOUR
TELE-EMPATHIC GIFT.

YOUR POWER TO SENSE
THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS AND
TO INFLUENCE THOSE FEELINGS.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

PRETTY COOL, HUH?

IS THAT WHAT I LOOKED
LIKE WHEN I FIRST SAW IT?

NO,
YOU JUST STARTED CRYING.

KIDDING.

SHALIMAR AND JESSE AND YOU
ARE ALL CHILDREN OF GENOME X.

GENOME X CONDUCTED A SECRET
HUMAN GENETICS PROGRAM WHICH HAD

THE UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES
OF CREATING MEN AND WOMEN WITH

SPECIAL ABILITIES LIKE
YOUR TELE-EMPATHIC POWER.

I KEEP TELLING YOU:
I DON'T HAVE ANY POWERS.

NOW, YOU'RE AWARE OF THESE
ODD STORIES THAT WE'VE BEEN

HEARING ABOUT RECENTLY.

CURIOUS EVENTS, INEXPLICABLE
MYSTERIES, HUMAN ODDITIES.

YEAH, BUT I NEVER BELIEVED
THOSE STORIES WERE TRUE.

YES, ALRIGHT, SOME OF
THEM ARE FAKE, SOME OF THEM ARE

HOAXES, BUT TO AN ALARMING
DEGREE, IT'S THE CHILDREN OF

GENOME X THAT ARE
BEHIND SUCH PHENOMENA.

SO, IT'S NOT ALL ALIENS AND
CRYSTALS AND RE-INCARNATION,

HUH?

YEAH, WELL OF COURSE NOT,
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT JESSE AND

SHALIMAR CAN DO.

THERE ARE PERHAPS A THOUSAND
CHILDREN OF GENOME X. NOW, SOME

OF THEM KNOW WHO AND WHAT
THEY ARE, BUT SOME OF THEM ARE

TERRIFIED AT THE CHANGES
THAT ARE HAPPENING TO THEM.

WELL, I STILL DON'T
GET WHY YOU KIDNAPPED ME.

WELL, I PREFER
TO CALL IT RECRUITMENT.

SO, ARE YOU ONE
OF THESE CHILDREN TOO?

NO, I WAS CHIEF
BIO-GENETICIST AT GENOME X.

THERE WERE TWO
MEN AND ONE WOMAN.

THE WOMAN,
SHE ATTACKED LIKE A TIGER.

ONE OF THE MEN SEEMED TO BE
ABLE TO GO FROM INTANGIBLE TO

MASSIVE AT WILL.

AND THE SECOND MAN GRABBED
THE GIRL BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO

GET TO HER.

THAT SOUNDS LIKE
ADAM AND HIS PEOPLE.

OUR GS AGENTS
ARE NEW AT THIS.

WELL, THEY HAVE TO GET BETTER
-- AND FAST, MR. THORNE.

YES, MR. ECKHART.

YEAH.

AH, GOOD TO GO, HUH?

DESPITE
YOUR GENETICALLY ENHANCED
ABILITIES, THE CHILDREN OF

GENOME X ARE NOT SUPER-HUMAN.

I KEEP TELLING YOU,
I DON'T HAVE ANY...

IT'S WIDELY
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO
RECOGNIZE THE TOLL THAT

THESE ABILITIES TAKE
ON YOUR BODY, MIND AND SOUL.

SOUL?

SOUL.

THERE'S A SPIRITUAL
SIDE TO YOUR CONDITION TOO.

MANY OF THE
NEW MUTANTS ARE UNDER THE
DELUSION THAT THEY'RE GOD.

NOW, I'VE DESIGNED THIS VDD
TO DIAGNOSTICALLY CALIBRATE YOUR

GENETIC ENHANCEMENT AND TO
IDENTIFY ANY ADJUSTMENT TO YOUR

DNA THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED,
SINCE YOUR NEW MUTANT DNA,

IT'S IN A CONSTANT
STATE OF EVOLUTION.

WELL, THAT WAS TOO WEIRD.

KIND OF LIKE HIM MYSELF.

YEAH, ME TOO.

HELPS ME GET IN
TOUCH WITH MY POWERS.

WELL, I DON'T
HAVE ANY POWERS.

AND I'M CERTAINLY
NOT A FREAK LIKE YOU TWO.

FREAK?

JESSE IS VERY SENSITIVE.

SHALIMAR IS VERY TERRITORIAL
AND VERY PROTECTIVE OF THE

PEOPLE SHE LOVES.

AND THAT INCLUDES JESSE.

CALL ME PARANOID.

BUT I FIGURE THE PARANOID
WILL INHERIT THE EARTH.

I THOUGHT YOU'D
OUTGROWN CARTOONS.

I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT ALL
THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN GOING ON

AH, IT'S CRAP.

AND THE INTERACTIVE
HOTLINE'S GOT TO BE A SCAM.

WHEN YOU TWO ARE FINISHED,
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE

STEPPING UP TO
THE BIG LEAGUES TOMORROW.

THE DEAL WITH CARTER'S A GO.

I HEARD ABOUT ALL THAT
BUSINESS LAST NIGHT, MASON.

SOUNDS LIKE ADAM TO ME.

YOU SEEM ALMOST AMUSED.

THAT YOU DON'T DESPISE
HIM FOR BETRAYING YOU REMAINS A

MYSTERY TO ME.

THAT YOU HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE COLLAPSE OF YOUR

IMMUNE SYSTEM WOULD HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT, EH?

YOU WERE ALWAYS
TOO HARD ON ADAM.

AND YOU WERE ALWAYS
TOO EASY, PAUL.

AND THAT'S HOW
HE STOLE YOUR DATABASE.

WHICH I HAVE
NEARLY RECONSTRUCTED.

SO WE CAN MAKE
AMENDS FOR THE HORRIFIC
MISTAKES WE'VE MADE.

I SHOULD HAVE KILLED ADAM
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

AND NOW BREEDLOVE
INTENDS TO GO TO THE PRESS
AND EXPOSE EVERYTHING.

AND I'LL NEVER GET THE CHANCE
TO BRING ADAM TO THE JUSTICE

THAT HE DESERVES.

WELL,
WE CAN CHANGE ALL OF THAT.

WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

WELL, I CAN'T COERCE HER INTO
ADMITTING SHE'S A NEW MUTANT.

FINE, I GUESS WE'VE DONE
EVERYTHING WE CAN, THEN.

MAYBE THE NEXT STEP IS TO
GET HER OUT OF TOWN

-- UNDER ECKHART'S RADAR.

I'LL GET
JESSE STARTED THEN.

GOOD.

NORMAL PEOPLE DON'T WANT
SUPER-POWERED FREAKS NEXT DOOR.

I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE
TOO THRILLED ABOUT HAVING NEW

MUTANTS AS COVERT OPS EITHER.

WELL, WE PUT THEM
IN THE FIELD AS AGENTS,

NO ONE
WILL KNOW ABOUT IT.

SORRY TO BARGE IN LIKE THIS,
PAUL, BUT I WANTED MR. THORNE

TO HAVE A LOOK AT SECURITY
SO HE'D BE ABLE TO BE

READY FOR YOU
WHEN YOU GO PUBLIC.

THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA.

SINCE I'M GOING TO THE PRESS
NEXT WEEK WITH FULL DISCLOSURE

OF WHAT'S BEEN
HAPPENING HERE SINCE THE
INCEPTION OF THIS PROGRAM.

AT LEAST CALL ME FIRST.

HAVE TO APPROACH
THIS WITH FINESSE.

I'LL GIVE
YOU A HEADS-UP.

THANKS, PAUL.

YOU SHOULD COME DOWN
AND VISIT US MORE OFTEN.

A WEEK DOESN'T
GIVE YOU MUCH TIME.

WOOH.

SO I GOT HERE A LITTLE EARLY.

THOUGHT I'D TAKE HER
OUT FOR A LITTLE TEST DRIVE.

WHAT?

YOU TOOK IT FOR A SPIN?

YOU GOT ANY IDEA WHAT WE COULD
GET FOR THIS AT A CHOP SHOP?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WE"?

UNLIKE YOU, I SET
HIGHER GOALS FOR MYSELF
THAN GRAND THEFT AUTO.

RIGHT ON TIME, I SEE.

MR. CARTER,
YOU REMEMBER BRENNAN AND TONY.

IT'S A BEAUTY.

I BET IT TAKES THE
CURVES AT 120, HUH?

I MEANT THE HICKMAN AND
WRIGHTSON SECURITIES BUILDING.

NOW, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
HAVE ONLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

SECONDS ONCE THE ALARM
IS CUT TO GET IN AND GET OUT.

WHEN YOU PICKED
MY POCKET THIS MORNING,
YOU GOT YOUR HANDS ON THIS.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT HAS THE TWIN.

THESE TWO KEYS NEED TO
BE ACTIVATED SIMULTANEOUSLY.

NOT TO WORRY, MR. CARTER,
WE WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

YEAH, SEE THAT YOU DON'T.

BECAUSE THERE'S
ALWAYS SOMEBODY THAT WANTS
YOUR PLACE ON THE FOOD CHAIN.

YOU.

YOU GOT STONES OF STEEL, DOG.

TAKING A JOYRIDE
IN THE CLIENT'S CAR.

NICE.

YEAH.

SO, NOW YOU SEE WHY
A CHOP SHOP ISN'T AN OPTION.

WHAT'S UP?

I DON'T KNOW.

I'VE BEEN
HANGING AROUND.

THIS WAY.

WELL,
I'LL SAY ONE THING.

THIS MUST BE ONE
HELL OF A BOOK STORE.

YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

ADAM...

AND A PRETTY GIRL.

IT'S ALMOST READY.

GOOD.

EMMA, SAY HELLO TO RUBY.

YES, THE PLACE IS A MESS,
BUT I AM SPOTLESS -- TRUST ME.

YOUR MIND, IT'S
AN OPEN BOOK TO ME.

RUBY'S A TELEPATH.

I PREFER ESPER,
IT JUST SOUNDS...

SEXIER.

OH ADAM, YOU TOLD
ME SHE WAS SPECIAL.

YOU DIDN'T TELL ME HOW SPECIAL.

WELL, COME ON, LET'S GO.

JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIES.

ALLISON, VINCE,
THIS IS EMMA.

WHAT'S UP, ADAM.

ADAM.

HEY, GIRL, WHAT'S UP.

WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

THIS IS A NEW
MUTANT SAFE HOUSE.

SAFE FROM WHAT?

YOUR ASSAILANTS LAST NIGHT, THEY
WERE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

SO, WHAT'S YOUR POWER?

I DON'T HAVE ANY POWERS.

AH, POWER OF DENIAL.

SO, YOU READY TO LEAVE TOMORROW?

WE'RE GOING TO
GET YOU OUT OF TOWN.

WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A
NEW IDENTITY, A WHOLE NEW LIFE.

WELL, WHAT IF
I DON'T WANT TO GO?

WELL,
THE PEOPLE WE RESCUED YOU
FROM LAST NIGHT WILL TRY AGAIN.

AND THEY'RE NOWHERE
NEAR AS FRIENDLY AS WE ARE.

WHY DON'T YOU SHOW HER AROUND.

YEAH.

IT'S TOO BAD ABOUT EMMA, HUH?

YEAH, NO KIDDING.

ADAM HAD A LOT
OF HOPES FOR HER.

NOW IT'S
STILL JUST US.

WELL,
WE'VE BOTH SEEN THAT
KIND OF DENIAL BEFORE.

YOU OKAY?

FINE, WHY?

WELL, SHE WAS PRETTY
NASTY TO BOTH OF US.

YEAH, SHE WAS ALSO
SCARED OUT OF HER WITS.

STILL, IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE
ANOTHER WOMAN ON THE TEAM.

I'M WITH YOU ON THAT ONE.

I THOUGHT SHE WOULD
HAVE MADE A GOOD FIT.

"WHEN GENOME X WAS CONCEIVED,
WE SAW OURSELVES AS PIONEERS

IN A NEW FRONTIER OF KNOWLEDGE.

MEN AND WOMEN WITH THE
POWER TO REMAKE THE WORLD.

THE POWER TO PLAY
GOD WITH THE GENETIC CODE.

ALL OF US AT GENOME X FEEL
ENORMOUS GUILT FOR THE HARM WE

HAVE CAUSED IN MANIPULATING
DNA AGAINST THE LAWS OF NATURE."

SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, PAUL.

AND WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

I DON'T
SHARE YOUR GUILT.

"THE GOVERNMENT OWES ENORMOUS
REPARATIONS TO THE VICTIMS OF

GENOME X FOR THE HORROR
INFLICTED ON THESE INNOCENTS."

CAN'T PUT THE DEMONS
BACK IN THE BOX AFTER
THEY'VE BEEN RELEASED.

THERE'S NO NEED FOR THEM TO
SUFFER WITHOUT COMPENSATION.

THE ONLY THING THIS
COMPENSATES IS YOUR GUILT.

YOU CREATE THESE ANOMALIES
AND THEN MAKE IT BETTER BY

APOLOGIZING, AND LET SOMEONE
ELSE CLEAN UP AFTER YOU.

PERHAPS IF YOU RECOGNIZED ADAM
FOR THE CRIMINAL THAT HE IS,

YOU WOULDN'T
BE SO SELF- DELUDED.

MR. THORNE.

BEFORE YOU WENT OFF THE DEEP
END YOU SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED

WITH ONE OF
YOUR INNOCENT VICTIMS.

WHAT?

THAT'S RIGHT.

DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE TO ME, DR. BREEDLOVE,

BECAUSE I'M A CHILD OF
GENOME X AND, QUITE FRANKLY,

I WOULDN'T HAVE GOT THIS
JOB IF I WASN'T SO SPECIAL.

IF ONLY YOU'D
KEPT YOUR MOUTH SHUT,

EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE.

BUT YOU HAD TO
BEAT YOURSELF UP WITH GUILT
OVER THE MESS YOU'VE MADE.

AND NOW I HAVE TO USE
YOUR LEMONS TO MAKE LEMONADE.

IT WAS NICE OF HIM TO REBUILD
THE DATABASE BEFORE HE DIED.

IT WILL MAKE TRACKING THESE
ANOMALIES THAT MUCH EASIER.

SO MUCH FOR THE PAPER TRAIL.

YOUR NEW IDENTITY.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

HEY.

TELL JESSE I'M SORRY
FOR THAT "FREAK" CRACK.

I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

IT'S ALREADY FORGOTTEN.

I GOT TO TELL YOU,
GIRL, I UNDERSTAND YOUR
DECISION COMPLETELY.

WHAT DECISION?

NOT TO JOIN MUTANT X. I
MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE EVERY NEW

MUTANT'S A HERO.

DID EVERYTHING GO AS PLANNED?

FIVE HUNDRED
TREASURY CERTIFICATES,
EACH WORTH TEN GRAND.

FOR A TOTAL OF TEN MIL'.

OH, WELL, ACTUALLY
THAT'S TWENTY MILLION.

SINCE THE CERTIFICATES BELONGED
TO YOU ALREADY, THAT'S TEN

MILLION AND ANOTHER TEN
FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY.

SMART BOY.

A THIEF WHO KNOWS
HIS INVESTMENTS.

I'D KEEP AN EYE ON
HIM IF I WERE YOU.

WHAT, HE PAYS US CHUMP CHANGE
AND DOUBLES HIS TEN MIL'?

THAT'S THE NATURE
OF THE BUSINESS.

HOTLINE.

CAN I HELP YOU?

YEAH.

IS IT TRUE YOU'RE
OFFERING MONEY FOR STORIES.

IF THEY'RE INTERESTING.

DO I HAVE A FREAK FOR YOU.

THIS GUY NAMED MULWRAY, BRENNAN
MULWRAY, SHOOTS LIGHTNING

FROM HIS HANDS.

AND HE'S A THIEF TOO.

WITH DR. BREEDLOVE'S DEATH,

I HAVE SET
IN MOTION SEVERAL SWEEPING
CHANGES IN OUR OPERATION.

STARTING WITH AN
EXPANDED BUDGET THAT WILL
AFFECT ALL DEPARTMENTS.

WE HAVE OPERATED UNDER
COVERT CONDITIONS SINCE

THE INCEPTION OF THIS PROJECT.

THAT NEED FOR
SECRECY HAS BEEN BROUGHT
HOME BY THIS BRUTAL MURDER.

A HEINOUS CRIME THAT WAS
COMMITTED BY A PRODUCT OF THE

PROGRAM, WHO SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO BREAK INTO OUR ARCHIVES

SECTION AND BURN
THAT HISTORICAL LANDMARK TO
THE GROUND IN THE PROCESS.

GENOME X WILL
NOT BE COWED, CORRUPTED OR
CO-OPTED BY THESE CREATURES.

INSTEAD, I HAVE BEEN MANDATED
TO CREATE THE GENETIC SECURITY

AGENCY TO PROTECT THE WORLD
FROM THIS RAPACIOUS MENACE.

WHILE OUR
PURE RESEARCH CONTINUES,
THIS COVERT FORCE WILL

TAKE THESE ANOMALIES
INTO CUSTODY UNDER A
CLOAK OF ABSOLUTE SECRECY.

I KNOW I CAN COUNT
ON YOU ALL TO DO YOUR BEST
IN THIS TIME OF TRANSITION.

THANK YOU.

THAT WENT WELL, DON'T YOU THINK?

WELL, THEY SEEMED HAPPY.

DON'T GET CARRIED
AWAY, MR. THORNE.

THEY'RE ALL JUST
EASILY BOUGHT BY FLATTERY
AND BIGGER PAYCHEQUES.

STATUS?

OH.

WE HAVE A LEAD ON THE ELECTRICAL
ANOMALY FROM OUR TAPS ON

THE PROXY BLUE HOTLINE.

MAY I?

DO I HAVE A FREAK FOR YOU.

THIS GUY NAMED MULWRAY, BRENNAN
MULWRAY, SHOOTS LIGHTNING

FROM HIS HANDS.

AND HE'S A THIEF TOO.

NICELY DONE.

THANK YOU.

WELL, LET'S START PERFORMING
THE JOB THAT WE WERE BORN TO

DO, SHALL WE?

INDEED.

SO HOW WELL DID YOU
KNOW THIS BREEDLOVE?

HE WAS MY MENTOR.

HE WAS THE GUY WHO STARTED
GENOME X. NOW, WITH HIS DEATH,

EVERYTHING I FEARED
HAS COME TO PASS.

OKAY, THE HYDROFOIL
LEAVES IN FIFTEEN MINUTES.

LET'S GO.

WHAT?

OH MY GOD.

WHAT?

IT'S THEM.

THEM?

THE GUYS THAT WERE AFTER ME.

DAMMIT.

ADAM?

ADAM?

I AM SO SORRY.

LOOK, EMMA USED
HER POWERS TO DITCH ME.

I'LL CHECK IN LATER.

WELL, SO MUCH FOR DENIAL.

WE GOT TO FIND HER.

YEAH.

CAN'T LET SOMEONE WITH HER
ABILITY TO MANIPULATE THE

FEELINGS OF OTHERS BECOME
THE TOOL OF OUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

BINGO.

ADAM, I'VE ACCESSED
THE SATELLITE DATA FEED.

THANKS, JESSE.

NOW ALL WE HAVE TO
DO IS FIND ALLISON'S CAR.

ON THE TRAIL, ADAM.

THIS SEAT TAKEN?

HEY, NO.

HAVE A SEAT.

I WAS KIND OF
HOPING TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

ACTUALLY, I SAW INTO
YOU THE OTHER NIGHT.

HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

IT'S A GIFT.

I THOUGHT
I COULD SENSE SOMETHING
SPECIAL ABOUT YOU TOO.

OH YEAH?

YEAH, BUT IT'S...

IT'S NOT A MIND THING.

YOU SEE,
I FOUND OUT I COULD THROW
OFF SPARKS WHEN A KID.

YOU KNOW, BEING THAT...

THAT DIFFERENT WAS JUST
ASKING FOR A WORLD OF HURT.

SO I ALWAYS
FELT LIKE A FREAK.

NO ONE EVER
SAW YOU DO IT?

NO, LIKE I SAID,
I KEEP IT TO MYSELF.

SAME WITH ME.

ONE DAY I'M SALESGIRL OF THE
MONTH AT LEVERMAN AND STOKES

AND...

YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW PERSUASIVE I
CAN BE WHEN IT COMES TO

MISSES AND PETITES.

NO, I DON'T THINK
I'D BE SURPRISED AT ALL.

NEXT DAY,
I'M TRAPPED IN SOMEBODY
ELSE'S PARANOID FANTASY.

NO ONE WANTS TO BE FRIENDS WITH
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW YOU'RE

FEELING AND CAN MAKE
YOU FEEL ANY WAY YOU CHOOSE.

BUT I USED TO LOVE TO
GET DATES TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS

SATURDAY NIGHT.

YEAH, I'LL BET.

OH, NOW YOU JUST USE
YOUR POWERS FOR GOOD?

I DON'T THINK
I'D CALL THEM POWERS.

COMES AND GOES, AND WHEN
THEY'RE HERE I DON'T HAVE A REAL

GOOD HANDLE ON THEM.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

HERE, TOUCH MY HAND.

TOUCH MY HAND.

NICE.

THERE'S THIS GUY, ADAM.

HE THINKS I CAN
LEARN TO CONTROL MY POWERS
WITH A LITTLE TRAINING.

NOW HE'S GOING
TO BE PISSED AT ME.

HE WANTED
ME TO JOIN HIM.

I JUST GOT SCARED.

WOAH, WOAH,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING, ARE YOU?

THE LADIES ROOM.

SENSATIONAL.

MIND IF I JOIN YOU, MR MULWRAY?

I'VE GOT IT, ADAM.

HALFWAY DOWN THE
500 BLOCK ON DARIEN STREET.

I'M ON MY WAY.

I TRACKED THE CAR.

WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU.

THE QUESTION IS:
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

I CAME HERE TO MAKE
YOU THE DEAL OF A LIFETIME.

FAST CARS.

HOT WOMEN.

ALL THE MONEY YOU'LL EVER NEED.

SEE, THE...

THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A MAN OF
YOUR TALENT, THEY'RE LIMITLESS.

TALENTS?

DON'T BE COY.

I'VE BEEN WATCHING
YOU FOR A LONG TIME.

REALLY?

HUH?

YOU KNOW, AS...

AS TEMPTING AS THAT
MAY SOUND, I THINK I'LL PASS.

I WOULDN'T DO
THAT IF I WERE YOU.

SHE'S HEADED
FOR THE SKYCOURSE.

SHE'S NOT ALONE.

I'M ON MY WAY.

YOU GOT HIM.

NEVER USED IT
AGAINST A PERSON BEFORE.

IS HE DEAD?

I DON'T KNOW.

DID YOU REALLY
THINK WE'D COME AFTER
A GUY LIKE YOU WITHOUT

BEING PREPARED?

THIS IS NOT GOOD.

NO, IT'S NOT, IS IT?

WE KNOW YOUR M.O., MR. MULWRAY.

AH, DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO DO THAT?

PISS US OFF, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
TO BEAT YOU SENSELESS ANYWAY.

YOU KNOW, ANYTIME YOU WANT
TO MAKE THESE GUYS JUMP THROUGH

HOOPS WOULD BE FINE WITH ME.

I CAN'T.

I LOSE IT WHEN
I'M STRESSED.

GREAT.

YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

IT'S GOING TO MAKE MR ECKHART
VERY HAPPY TO TAKE YOU ALIVE.

BRENNAN!

STOP.

LET THEM GO.

THIS ISN'T OVER YET.

ADAM.

I'M SO SORRY.

I DIDN'T MEAN TO
CAUSE ALL THIS TROUBLE.

AND NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
THE DANGER WE'RE ALL IN.
