The war had all but ground to a halt
in the blink of an eye.

Lucian, the most feared and ruthless
leader ever to rule the Lycan clan...

...had finally been killed.

The Lycan horde
scattered to the wind...

...in a single evening
of flame and retribution.

Victory, it seemed, was in our grasp...

...the very birthright of the Vampires.

Nearly six centuries had passed
since that night.

Yet the ancient feud proved unwilling
to follow Lucian to the grave.

Though Lycans were
fewer in number...

...the war itself had become
more perilous.

For the moon no longer
held her sway.

Older, more powerful Lycans
were now able to change at will.

The weapons had evolved,
but our orders remained the same:

Hunt them down and kill them off,
one by one.

A most successful campaign.

Perhaps too successful.

For those like me, a Death Dealer...

...this signaled the end of an era.

Like the weapons
of the previous century...

...we, too, would become obsolete.

Pity, because I lived for it.

Bloods!

lt's all right. lt's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

You're acting like a pack
of rabid dogs!

And that, gentlemen...

...simply will not do.

Not if you expect to defeat
the Vampires on their own ground.

Not if you expect to survive at all.

Pierce! Taylor!

Put some clothes on, will you?

We have a serious problem.

l'll have to run a few tests.

lt's definitely an irradiated fluid
of some sort.

Ultraviolet ammunition.

Daylight, harnessed as a weapon.

You expect me to believe
that a mangy animal...

...came up with a bullet specifically
engineered to kill Vampires?

No, l'm betting it's military.

Something they stole.
Some sort of high-tech tracer round.

l don't care where
they got these things.

Rigel is dead, and Nathaniel
could still be out there.

Let's gather the Death Dealers
and go back.

Absolutely not. Not now.
Not for a random incursion.

The Awakening is a few days off,
and this house is in unrest as it is.

Random? They opened fire on us
in full view of the public.

-And from what l heard in that tunnel--
-You said you didn't see anything.

l know what l heard,
and l know what my gut tells me.

There could be dozens
of Lycans down there.

Who knows, maybe more. Hundreds.

We've hunted them
to the brink of extinction.

Kraven's right, Selene.

There's not been a den
of that magnitude for centuries.

-Not since the days of Lucian.
-l know that, Kahn.

But l'd rather you prove me wrong
by checking it out.

Have your men tighten things up.

l'll have Soren assemble
a search team.

-No, l want to lead the team myself.
-Absolutely not! Soren will handle it.

Hundreds, really?

Viktor would believe me.

-l'd never treat you like that.
-Of course not.

Now run along and make sure she's
dressed and ready for her guests.

-lt's a waste of time, you know.
-What is?

l doubt Viktor would want you freezing
in here, staring at his tomb for hours.

No, he'd want the Death Dealers out
there, scouring every inch of the city.

Kraven. l'll never understand
why Viktor left him in charge.

He's a bureaucrat, not a warrior.

We need to get you ready.

-For what?
-The party.

Amelia's envoy will be here
any minute.

Oh, yes.

You should definitely wear this one.
lt's perfect.

They were after you.

He's attractive...

-...for a human.
-Who's attractive?

l planned to have you
at my side this evening.

Take Erika.
She's dying to be at your side.

lf you ask me, you take this warrior
business far too seriously.

You can't undo the past,
no matter how many you kill.

And besides...

...what's the point
in being immortal...

...if you deny yourself
life's simple pleasures?

Do you see this human?

-What of him?
-l'm beginning to think the Lycans--

Blast!

Put on something elegant
and be quick about it.

Kraven, l'm serious.
l think they were following him.

Other than food,
why would Lycans stalk a human?

Any progress?

Let's find out.

Negative.

You heading home?

Yeah, Nicholas gave me
a couple hours off.

By the way...

...he said you did a terrific job
tonight with the surgery.

Yeah.

Take it easy.

We were ambushed.

Death Dealers, three of them.

-And the candidate?
-We lost him.

You lost him?

Look at this mess.

Ag rounds. High content.

Prevented him from
making the change.

No use in digging out the rest.
Silver's penetrated his organs.

Regeneration's impossible
at this point.

Let's take these out.

Relax.

The Vampires didn't realize
you were following a human...

-...did they, Raze?
-No.

l mean, l don't think so.

-You don't think, or you don't know?
-l'm not sure.

Negative.

l really must have a look
at this Michael.

Must l do everything myself?

Our noble houses may be
separated by a great ocean...

...but we are equally committed
to the survival of the bloodlines.

And when Amelia arrives
to awaken Marcus...

...in just two days' time...

...we shall once again
be united as a single coven!

We want to thank our hosts
for their generous hospitality.

He comes in, he does his job
and then he goes home.

Other than that,
I don't know what to tell you.

Interns work around the clock.
We don't have much of a life.

You know where we can find him?

No.

You can try him at home,
or you'll have to wait till he gets back.

He's not in some kind
of trouble, is he?

This is Michael. I'm not in right now.
Please leave a message.

Michael, it's Adam. The police were
just in the hospital looking for you.

They were convinced you were
involved with a shootout.

I told them there's no way
you'd be involved with that...

...but they're looking for you.
Right now.

Why are they after you?

Shit!

Hello, Michael.

What the fuck is going on?

Stop the car.

Stop the car!

Back off!

Okay.

Okay.

All right.

But you've lost a lot of blood.

lf you don't stop the car,
you'll get us both killed.

-l'm not screwing around!
-Neither am l!

Shut up and hold on.
l'll be fine.

Shit!

A second escape. lmpressive.

Perhaps Raze wasn't
overstating matters.

Raze didn't bring back this.

lf Michael is indeed The Carrier,
the Vampires could--

Relax, old friend.

l've tasted his flesh.

Just two days till full moon.

Soon, he will be a Lycan.

Soon, he will come looking for us.

lt's a shame we don't have more.

Positive.

Lay still. Your skull's
taken a good knock.

You've been unconscious
for a while.

Do you have any idea
why those men were after you?

Where am l?

You're safe.

l'm Selene.

So, for once, the rumors were true.

The whole house has been absolutely
buzzing about your new pet.

-Are you going to try to turn him?
-Of course not.

So why did you bring him here?

He saved my life.

-Why are you here?
-Kraven sent me.

He wants to see you. Now.

This is completely unacceptable!

You go against my orders and spend
the night away from the mansion...

...with a human? A human you've
since brought back to my house.

As far as l'm concerned,
this is still Viktor's house.

Look, l don't want to argue.

Understand that Michael is somehow
important to the Lycans--

-So now it's ''Michael''!
-Would you just hear me out--

lt's beyond me why you're so
obsessed over this ridiculous theory.

Lucian wouldn't be a bit
interested in a human...

...Michael or otherwise.

Wait a minute.

You're infatuated with him,
aren't you?

Now, that's a ridiculous theory.

ls it?

Leave us!

l sure hope you never get
pissed off with me.

Hold on.

Check this out.

Go ahead. Squeeze off a few.

Eject the mag.

You've copied the Lycan rounds.
Silver nitrate.

A lethal dose.

They won't dig these out,
like our usual rounds.

Straight into the bloodstream.
Ain't nothing to dig out.

Tell me, Kahn.

Do you believe Lucian died
the way they say?

-Kraven telling war stories again?
-That's my point.

lt's nothing but an ancient story.
His story.

There's not a shred of proof
he killed Lucian, only his word.

l've never underestimated
Kraven's lust for advancement...

...but Viktor believed him
and that's all that matters.

-Where you going with this anyway?
-Nowhere.

Engaging Death Dealers in public
and chasing after some human...

...was not what l had in mind. You
were told to set up shop and lay low!

Calm yourself, Kraven!

The human doesn't concern you.

And besides, l've laid low
for quite long enough.

Just keep your men at bay, Lucian.

At least for the time being.

Don't force me to regret
our arrangement.

You just concentrate on your part.

Remember, l've bled for you
once already.

Without me, you'd have nothing.

You'd be nothing.

Of the scores of brave souls
who entered Lucian's fortress...

...a single Vampire survived:
Kraven...

...who was richly rewarded
for not only setting the great blaze...

...but for returning with evidence
of the Lycan master's demise...

...the branded skin,
cut from Lucian's very arm.

l've been looking for you.
He's been bitten.

Your human,
he's been marked by a Lycan.

-Did Kraven put you up to this?
-No.

l saw the wound with my own eyes,
l swear it.

But what about the Covenant?

You know it's forbidden!

And ever since he bit me,
l've been--

l've been having these hallucinations
and these delusions.

All l know is, it feels like
my skull is splitting in half.

Okay, so a full-grown man bit you?

Jesus.

Are you sure this wasn't a dog?

l said, it was a man.
lt was a man.

-Okay, l got it.
-He was after me.

-And that woman from the subway--
-What woman?

Haven't you been listening to me?
She took me hostage!

All right.

Just-- Please.

l'll help you get this all sorted out,
all right? l'll be right back.

Let go, Michael.

Let go.

Just calm down, okay?
l'm gonna be back in a minute.

-That's a promise.
-All right.

Please forgive me...

...but l desperately need
your guidance.

To my knowledge...

...an Awakening has never been
attempted by one such as myself.

The elders hold the power to organize
their memories and thoughts...

...into a single, cohesive vision...

...a detailed record of their reign.

I can only hope Viktor
will hear my plea.

Please forgive me,
but l desperately need your guidance.

l apologize for awakening you
ahead of schedule...

...but l fear we may all be
in grave danger.

Especially you, my lord,
if left in your weakened state.

For l believe that Lucian
is alive and well.

Here. Now. ln this very city...

...preparing to hit us
during the Awakening ceremony.

Even more disturbing...

...is that if l'm correct...

...it would mean that Kraven
is in league with him.

What's so pressing?

Take a look.

Selene!

I want to speak with Selene!

ls that Michael?

-ls it Michael?
-What the hell is going on?

What's happening to me?

I'm coming out.

lf you go to him, you'll never
be welcome in this house again.

Now that Viktor's awake, we'll see
what he has to say about that.

Get in.

Look, l warned her. l warned her,
but she didn't listen.

-l should've told you sooner.
-Told me what?

Her human, Michael...

...he's not a human at all.

He's a Lycan.

What?

What's this ruckus?

Never come here again.
They'll kill you.

Why? Who are you people?

Leave us.

Like it or not, you're in the middle
of a war that's raged for 1 000 years.

A blood feud between
Vampires and Lycans.

Werewolves.

Consider yourself lucky.

Most humans die within an hour
of being bitten by an immortal.

The viruses we transmit are deadly.

And if you bit me,
l'd become a Vampire instead?

No, you'd die.

No one's ever survived
a bite from both species.

By rights, l'd stop the car
and kill you myself--

-Why are you helping me?
-l'm not.

l track down and kill your kind.

My only interest is finding out
why Lucian wants you so badly.

Do you know why l've
been awakened, servant?

No, my lord.

-But l'll soon find out.
-You mean when you find her.

-Yes, my lord.
-You must let her come to me.

We have much to discuss,
Selene and l.

She has shown me
a great many disturbing things.

Things that will be dealt with
soon enough.

This coven has grown weak,
decadent.

Perhaps l should have left someone
else in charge of my affairs.

Still...

...her memories...

...are chaotic.

There's no sense of time.

Please, my lord,
let me summon assistance.

You're in need of rest.

l've rested enough.

What you will do
is summon Marcus.

But he still slumbers, my lord.

Amelia and the Council members
are arriving tomorrow night...

...to awaken Marcus.

Not you, my lord.

You've been awakened
a full century ahead of schedule.

l'm seeing these things,
these hallucinations.

They're not hallucinations,
they're memories.

You've been bitten. His memories
have been passed to you.

This is one of the places we use
for interrogations. lt should be safe.

-Ziodex lndustries.
-We own it.

First there was synthetic plasma,
now this.

Once it's approved,
it should be our newest cash crop.

lt's cloned blood.

What are these for?

Lycans are allergic to silver.

lf we don't get our bullets out quickly,
they die during questioning.

What do you do with them after?

We put the bullets back in.

-How are things progressing?
-We're ready.

Why do you hate them so much?

l've already told you,
we're at war.

So you're just following orders?

Why can't you just answer
the question?

Fine.

Something was in the stable...

...tearing our horses to pieces.

l couldn't have saved my mother.

Or my sister.

Their screams woke me.

My father died outside,
trying to fend them off.

l stood at my door...

...about to run
to my nieces' room when....

Twin girls.

Barely 6 years old.

Butchered...

-...like animals.
-Jesus Christ.

The next thing l knew,
l was in his arms.

The war had spilled into our house.

He'd been tracking the Lycans
for days.

He drove them off and saved me.

-Who?
-Viktor.

The oldest and strongest of us.

That night,
he made me a Vampire.

He gave me the strength
to avenge my family.
