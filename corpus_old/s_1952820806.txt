Taqi.

It hurts.

It's Apuna!
Can you hear me?

Apuna?

Yes.

He stole it.

What?

He's crazy!

He stabbed me.

Can you stand?

He stole it...
What?

...so I took it.

What?

Don't let him have it.

What did he take?

My radio.

He stole it, but...

I took it back.

Hold on!

Miqu!

Miqu! What did you do?

Apuna!

Did I kill him?

Yes.

That's enough!

It wasn't my fault!

You saw it, right?

He was trying to kill me!

I saw it.

It's not my fault, right?

Get on. We'll go home now.

You crazy motherfucker!

Enough!

We're going home.

What are you going to do?

What are you going to tell them?

Stay away from there!

It's my sled!

We can't bring him back.

If we do, they're gonna take me.

We're not going to take him back!
Do you hear me?

Yes, I hear you.

What will you do?

I don't know.

We can say he fell through the ice.

Or a bear got him.

They won't believe you.

They will if you tell them.

There's a crack down that way.

I could take him there.

No one will know.

I fucked up.

Help me, Apuna!

You're my friend!

He has a son.

I'll raise him.
I have a son too.

I'll take care of him.

His son is like my nephew.

I'll teach him how to hunt.

I'm done with that!

If they send me to jail,
who's gonna raise my son?

Or his?

You?

That's what will happen
if you take him back.

They'll send me outside,
down South,

I'll never see my son again.

I'll never hunt again.

Don't take him back.

Take my sled!

And my dogs! Anything you want!

I said, stay away from there!

OK.

Let's take him off.
