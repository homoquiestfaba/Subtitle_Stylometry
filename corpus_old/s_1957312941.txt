<i>We lived in a decent house.</i>

<i>I had two sisters,

<i>This is me

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(DOOR OPENS)

Thank you, Glasgow!
Goodnight!

(ALAN PANTING)

Jesus Christ, have you got
your sister's make-up on?

I'm not a pooftie, Dad.

Well, why are you
poncing about like one?

You're a bloody disgrace.

I'm just pissing about, Dad.

You should be on the street
with your football.

Go and wash that shite off,
go on.

(DOOR SLAMS)

You should be on the street

playing football, you wee cunt!

<i>â™ª There was a soldier
A Scottish soldier</i>

ALAN: <i>It's a cliche,</i>

<i>but I never felt
I fitted in with my family.</i>

JOHN: I just don't get it.

Ah, but your mates
don't spend it on make-up

and posters of men
dressed up as tarts.

ALAN: <i>I loved my ma
and my sisters.</i>

JOHN: You're not a kid.

ALAN: <i>But Dad hated
everything I did.</i>

You get nothing in this life
if you're not prepared to work.

ALAN: <i>And Grandma
just hated me.</i>

ginger bastard.

(YOUNG ALAN WHISTLES)

ALAN: <i>I had
two obsessions back then,</i>

<i>serious now,
music and money.</i>

I've got an <i>Advertiser.</i>

Do you want an <i>Advertiser,</i> sir?
Put your money in the box.

There you go, thank you.

(MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)

(YOUNG ALAN WHISTLES)

Oh, wee man,
are you into your music?

Yeah.

You like T-Rex?

Aye, so what?

Nothing, they're fucking cool.

(BOY SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)

Do you like Thin Lizzy?

Do you know
they're playing the Barras?

Fuck off, are they
playing the Barras?

Aye.

Next week.

Cockney Rebel supporting.

YOUNG BOBBY:
You mean in the Barras, aye?

Bobby.

"Rebel, rebel".
Fucking ace, man.

Go get the other copy, Bobby.
I'll buy it you.

Aye?
Aye.

So, where the fuck do you make
that kind of money?

See, so I get 4p
for every newspaper I sell,

but they cost 15p.

Now if I turn up
an hour early though,

five instead of 6:00,
there's no one around.

<i>So, I take a load of extras,
sell them on top.</i>

YOUNG BOBBY:
<i>They don't count 'em?</i>

YOUNG ALAN: <i>No.</i>

Guess how much
I made last week.

Don't know.
Guess.

A fiver.

Twenty.

I'm gonna be a millionaire

What, selling
fucking papers? (LAUGHS)

Fuck off, Bobby,
I'm just a rebel.

BOTH: Rebel!

(JOHN EXHALES)

ALAN: <i>Dad was
a talentless bastard,</i>

<i>but he had one skill.</i>

<i>He could smell money,
like a pig with truffles.</i>

(DOOR SLAMS)
ALAN: I earned it.

He's not lying, Dad.

Mom, I earned it.
I swear I did.

I'd just sell a few extras,
I take.

You mean steal.

Dad, I actually
increased circulation.

Oh, it's okay
to steal from the people

paying your wages,
he's doing them a favor.

Dad, it's not fucking stealing.

No, no!
Don't you dare!

You think
you're clever, Alan,

but you're not clever,
you know nothing.

Oh, John, John!

Darling, let me see you.
Oh, you're bleeding.

Jesus.

It's no good, Ma,
I can't make it stick.

You'll have to go to A&E.

All right. Well then,
you take him, Laura.

(YOUNG ALAN BREATHES HEAVILY)

and if anyone asks, Al,
you fell when you were out.

Okay?

That's my good boy.

ALAN: <i>It was shameful</i>

<i>if Social Services
paid you a visit back then.</i>

<i>Like most families,
we sorted out our own mess.</i>

ANNOUNCER ON RADIO:
<i>Hear the band</i>

<i>the whole world

<i>Oasis, live

ALAN: Mate, slow down a minute.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Where rock rocks.</i>
Mate.

RADIO PRESENTER:
<i>Wow, that gig is sold out.</i>

<i>These guys, they are
like the new Beatles...</i>

ALAN: <i>The 1960s,
they basically buried Jesus,</i>

<i>and Bowie was
the new messiah.</i>

<i>I wanted to walk
where he walked,</i>

<i>and do all the things he did.</i>

(MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>But, I didn't have any talent,
which limited my options some.</i>

JOHN: Okay, son, you're
gonna be Murray's apprentice.

This is a big opportunity.
Right.

Hey, hey, hey,
don't embarrass me, all right?

(CAR HORN HONKS)

Good boy.

(YOUNG ALAN BREATHES HEAVILY)

(METAL CLANGING)

ALAN: <i>I tried
not to embarrass my dad,</i>

<i>but that didn't stop his mates

<i>and spraying my balls red.</i>

You fucking wee tube.

ALAN: <i>As an initiation.</i>

Fucking bastards.

Fucking...
You dirty wee ginger bastard.

I'm not... Oh, no.
I can explain.

TV PRESENTER:
<i>President Kennedy...</i>

ALAN: <i>People talk about telly
in reference to history.</i>

<i>You remember watching
the news about Kennedy,</i>

<i>or the moon landing.</i>

<i>Queen's Coronation.</i>

YOUNG ALAN: Fuck.

<i>That.</i>

<i>There was only one historical
televised event in our house.</i>

<i>They're a group
called the Sex Pistols.</i>

ALAN: <i>And that
changed everything.</i>

<i>â™ª I am an anti-Christ</i>

<i>â™ª I am an anarchist</i>

<i>â™ª Don't know what I want</i>

<i>â™ª But I know how to get it</i>

<i>â™ª I wanna destroy

<i>The new craze, they tell me.</i>

<i>â™ª Your future dream

<i>â™ª 'Cause I</i>

<i>â™ª I wanna be anarchy</i>

<i>â™ª In the city

ALAN: <i>Musicians
are such boring people.</i>

<i>Why should talent have anything
to do with rock and roll?</i>

<i>Why should music be
in the possession of people</i>

<i>so</i> (BLEEP) <i>dull?</i>

TV PRESENTER: <i>I'll say
nothing else about him.</i>

(BREATHES HEAVILY)
<i>We'll be back tomorrow,</i>

<i>I'll be seeing you soon, I hope,
I'm not seeing you again,</i>

<i>from me though, goodnight.</i>

ALAN: <i>Now there
were new rules.</i>

<i>There were no rules.</i>

<i>I didn't need talent,</i>

<i>I just needed a guitar
and some mates.</i>

(GUITARS PLAYING)

We have Andrew Innes
on lead guitar.

And on the bass guitar,
the wee ginger bastard himself,

Alan McGee.

(YOUNG BOBBY SHOUTING)

(DOOR OPENS)

Look at this, son. Is this
this new punk rock thing?

Aye.

What's the name of this outfit?

(YOUNG BOBBY GRUNTS)

The Drains.
The Drains.

Well, I don't want you
blocking the drains, Bobby.

Just keep it down
a wee bit, eh?

Aye, see you, Dad.

The fucking Drains, eh?

(DOOR CLOSES)

Your dad's cool, Bobby.

What's that thing
he was wearing?

Ah, he's into his politics.

He'll run for Parliament
one day.

Aye, he's a socialist.

My dad talks about socialists.
Fucking hates 'em.

Oh, what's your old man into?

Just boring stuff.

What's all this Grandma Barr
tells us, painting your pubes.

Oh no, Dad. That was
just fucking some...

Are you fucking mental?
What's gotten into you?

This is all that punk rock shite
they've been talking about, aye.

Hey, this is a decent house.
On, aye.

Hey, if I so much as hear you
mention those sexy pistols,

you'll wish you were never born.

Now get that shit off.

You look ridiculous.

YOUNG INNES:
<i>And what have we got up here?</i>

Lena Zavaroni,
The fucking Bay City Rollers.

Ah, let's go to London,
let's just fucking go.

My Dad'll never let me
go to London, Innes.

Doesn't matter,
you're nearly 18.

(PUNK ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

JOHN: Do you know
what punk means?

It's American slang
for homosexuals in prison.

<i>â™ª I got a feeling
inside of me</i>

<i>â™ª It's kinda strange
like a stormy sea</i>

<i>â™ª I don't know why
I don't know why â™ª</i>

Have you ever even
been to London?

Do you know anyone there?

No, I can be whatever
I wanna be in London.

My dad'll skin me alive,
you daft cunt.

Fucking do you for kidnapping.

And you
for kiddie fiddling, Alan.

You come and join us when
you've got some pubes, eh, Bob.


We've only just started
going out with each other.

You're a ginger prick, Alan.

You've got a chance to become
a qualified electrician.

You cannae just leave.

Innes, it's in here, man.

Can you hold that for us, pal?
Right, here we go.

It feels like
you're running away from me.

<i>â™ª I can't stop â™ª</i>

Wanker.
(YOUNG BOBBY LAUGHS)

YOUNG ALAN AND YOUNG INNES:
Oh, fuck off.

You two, out.

Fucking hell, right.

I'll get you in the Freemasons,
we look after one another.

Fucking hell!
Piss off.

I'll write to you
every day, Yvonne.

Fucking pen pal.

(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

YVONNE: No!

YOUNG ALAN: All right.

Think about the future,
son, eh?

I'm always thinking
about the future, Dad.

It's you that's not.

ALAN: <i>Los Angeles,</i>

<i>land of the back stabbers,
the vacuous, and the soulless.</i>

<i>They say in London,
you're never more than</i>

<i>six feet away
from a sewer rat.</i>

<i>Well, in LA, it's the same,
except here, it's dealers...</i>

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
ALAN:... <i>whores, pimps,</i>

<i>and fucking agents.</i>

Sup, man, how you doing?
Good to see you, Rich.

Don't mind if I do, huh?
(ALAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

You Brits
are fucking crazy, man.

You come to LA, you hang out
in a fucking hotel room.

That's why you guys
are all pale.

So, we got the, uh...

Got the what?

The gear.


I'm fucking with you, man.
Got the fucking gear.

It's strong though, man.

Okay, that shit's like
some new shit that's come in.

People are going crazy
over that shit.

That is all there.

ALAN: <i>Forget everything
in that last voice-over,</i>

<i>I fucking love LA.</i>

Later, bro.

I've got it, I've got it.
Yeah, I'll call you.

Cheers, Rich.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

(PHONE RINGING)

Hey, Felipe, yeah.

Oh, yeah, that's right,
yeah, Gemma, it's the magazine.

Yeah, some interview, yeah,
show them my poolside table,

<i>take in a couple of smudges.</i>

<i>Yeah, lovely, love you.</i>

(ALAN SIGHS)

YOUNG INNES:
Oh, this is fucking great.

Well, what do you think?

It's a shithole, Innes.

That may very well be the case,
but it's fucking free.

Where do we sleep?

Anywhere you like.

What the fuck, man?

It's London,
what did you expect?

I'm a nihilist, man,
there's nothing to it.

ALAN: <i>So anyway,
I'd left a decent job,</i>

<i>decent home, decent birds,</i>

<i>to move into some London
shithole with my best mates</i>

<i>and some random smackheads.</i>

Thought I got scurvy once.

Scurvy?

Yeah, scurvy.
Can you spell that for me?

Yeah, S-C-U-R-V-E, no, Y,

fucking one of them.

Scurvy is like
a medieval disease

that pirates would get
from not eating properly.

ALAN: <i>We settled down,
despite the squalor.</i>

<i>By the time we got to London,
punk was over.</i>

<i>It had left all these various
counter-cultures in its wake,</i>

<i>all wanting to be seen
and heard.</i>

<i>We spent our dole money
making a demo.</i>

Bobby's learning bass
with Caesar McNulty.

Altered Images?
Aye.

Throb's learning guitar.
It's in the demo.

Just smell that, Alan.
Do you know what it is?

B-O? Fish?

It's the smell of possibilities.

Laughing Apple.

Hopeless this morning.

No.
Laughing Apple.

I heard this job's
going at British Rail.

British Rail?

I could go London to Glasgow
line to see Yvonne.

Fuck Yvonne.

No, no, let's face it,
one of us needs a job.

You can't run a venue
and press records

and promote a band
on 13 a week, can we?

Laughing Apple. Greatest band
to come out of Scotland!

Laughing Apple, Laughing Apple.

Laughing Apple! Greatest band

Cunt!

(BAND TUNING INSTRUMENTS)

ALAN: <i>We sorted out our line up</i>

<i>with that nihilist

Are you sure about him?

I didn't say he could play,
I said he had a kit.

It'll be fine.

Hello, we're the Laughing Apple

Come on, lads and lasses.

ALAN: <i>But even though
we weren't selling out gigs,</i>

<i>I was still spending every penny
pressing our records.</i>

Ah, good.

ALAN: <i>Surprisingly.</i>

We sold all the other copies.

You have?

Oh, yeah, yeah,

Tell that to your pal, Innes.

Had a kidney pack up
and moved back.

Drugs, no doubt,
that and living in a shithole.

ALAN: <i>Innes
was more into the scene</i>

<i>than just the music,
and he did lose a kidney.</i>

No, mam, he's on the mend,

and his dad says
he can move back

only if he gets a place
at Uni though.

But we've got
a new guitarist now,

and he's more sensible.

(CROWD CHATTERING)

GEMMA: <i>So, you were
shooting for the moon,</i>

but you still had
a boring job, huh?

Come on, all jobs are boring,
when you think about it.

Even being a millionaire
is bloody monotonous, you know.

As soon as someone
makes a million,

all they can think about doing
is making another million,

another million,
another million.

Well, hence drowning in money.

I told you that?

Your dream,
your recurring nightmare.

Have it on a sandwich,
you'll be great.

Thank you.

at the Jesus and Mary Chain
concerts.

People can say what they want.

(BACKGROUND MUSIC PLAYING)

WOMAN ANNOUNCER:
<i>That happened tonight</i>

<i>accompanied by,
no doubt, rioting.</i>

It's Jesus and Mary Chain.

ALAN: <i>You see, magic isn't about
pulling rabbits out of hats,</i>

<i>but it is about making
something materialize.</i>

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Hailed as the most
controversial band

since the Sex Pistols.

JIM: We're not remotely
like the Sex Pistols.

The comparison's silly.

Don't particularly
like them, so...

We're a very commercial group,
you know.

Some say that
the Jesus and Mary Chain

is all about aggression,
violence.

You know what The Beatles did

when they were doing it
in the '80s?

We've got our eyes
on the pop charts, you know,

direct competition is, like,
Culture Club and Duran Duran.

DUTCH INTERVIEWER:
The New Musical Express

compared it with Joy Division
for its intensity.

Joy Division were fucking shite.

We don't even
like being mentioned

in the same breath as them.

Joy Division were boring.

(RECORD SCRATCHES)
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

ALAN: <i>Conjuring
success and victory,</i>

<i>but these days, that's in film,
and TV and music.</i>

(CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

<i>See, if you possess
a certain understanding,</i>

<i>you can make it work
in your favor.</i>

(CHATTERING CONTINUES)

Gonna be bigger than U2.

<i>We were being magicians
with Creation Records,</i>

<i>we were like
accidental alchemists.</i>

<i>Sometimes we seemed
to turn shit into gold.</i>

Alan, bank statements.

ALAN: <i>And sometimes,
much as we loved it</i>

<i>it just stayed shit.</i>


(SONG PLAYING IN BACKGROUND)

<i>â™ª So young</i>

Look, is it just the cash flow,
because if it is...

I'm afraid it's the maintenance
of your overdraft and loans.

I'm about to do a deal

that is gonna turn
everything around.

What's that?

Demos of future releases,
chart material, pure pop.

Hits!

Alan, the money you earn from
managing the, uh, Mary and...

Jesus and Mary Chain.
Jesus and Mary Chain,

you can't keep funding a label

out of your own pocket.

Why not?

Some of these acts I've got
are gonna be bigger than U2.

I've done the research,

and the fact is, the record
industry in this country

ain't what it used to be.

Comedy is the new
rock and roll, Alan,

Newman and Baddiel, they just
sold out Wembley Arena.

"That's your Mom that is!"

They're very good, but do you
have an act that can do that?

Will any of they?

No.

What you have is a very small,
potentially healthy, business

with a thick
and lowering glass ceiling.

What we have to do
is minimize the venture,

try and increase the profits

and then use them to address
the charges on your debts,

just run a small tight ship.

It's not the '60s anymore, Alan.

Or?

Or you lose everything.

Thanks a bunch, Nostradamus.

Catch you later, eh?

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Joe, I've just been meeting
the biggest cunt of my life,

I mean, everyone,

every fucker in the office
10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

Whilst we appreciate

everything that's going on
at the moment.

Shut up, Ed!
It's the fucking bailiffs.

Who? The bailiffs?
ED: Oh, man!

No, no, no, no, we've got
a band called The Bailiffs.

No, no, no, no.

Demos, promos, white labels,

anything you can find
in this box, any value.

ED: TV piece.


Later.

Uh, you're Alan McGee?

As I live and breathe.

Demos, promos, white labels.

Worth a fortune.

Sorry, boys, just on the phone
to New York closing a deal.

Got a band that are gonna be
bigger than U2, unbelievable!

How much was it again?
Â£400. (LAUGHS)

Nae sweat.

<i>Uno.</i>

<i>Dos. Tres.</i>

Go on, Dick.
At this rate, how long?

(JOE BELCHES LOUDLY)
ALAN: How long can we survive?

At this rate?

Alan, we're already dead.

You know,
on a long enough timeline,

the survival rate
of most things is zero.

Shut up, Ed. How long?

If we can somehow maintain
this line of credit

we've got about a month.
Month?

It's not bad, we can fix it.

Rome was built in a month.

That's not exactly the same.

Shut up, Ed.

We'll have to postpone
the next release, just fuck it.

We do that, we're not
a record label anymore.

Well, I mean,
how could things get any worse?

I'm pregnant, Alan.

You see, by then, me and Yvonne
had already split up.

<i>But we hooked up one night
on the rebound</i>

<i>and she got knocked up,</i>

so, we're separated.

It doesn't look like we're gonna
get back together, does it, so...

Get a fucking grip,
you stupid ginger gargoyle.

ALAN: <i>See, Yvonne had had enough</i>

<i>of the all-nighters</i>

<i>and the bands crashing over,
and poverty.</i>

<i>She was having a baby
and all of that was gonna stop,</i>

<i>whether I liked it or not.</i>

<i>And pretty rude about it.</i>

You horrible goblin.

So, you just weren't ready
to be a father?

I had no say.

I'm keeping it.

You have no fucking option.

The truth is we'd drifted apart.

You can't afford to divorce me.

You've got no choice, pal.

But see if she'd said something,

anything at all,

begged me to stay, I would have.

But when someone tells me
I don't have a fucking option,

that's when I'm
at my absolute worst.

I've got to prove them wrong.

So, you guys split, divorced?

Yeah, she kept the poxy semi,
gave birth to Daniel.

Met someone else,
you know, good man.

Bit of a boring cunt, mind.

Waiter!

ALAN: So now,<i>
I was officially single.</i>

Thatcher's a Nazi.
Yeah.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

Disgrace to feminism.
Yes!

ALAN: <i>Free to make
an absolute twat out of myself</i>

<i>at any opportunity.</i>

MAN: Turns out I went
to the doctors and it was piles.

WOMAN: Yes!


Bobby!

Oh, fuck off.

Ah! We, we played a fundraiser

for the striking miners
last week.

A fundraiser?

Yeah, we raised a few quid,
didn't we, Ed?

Fundraising isn't gonna help
the oppressed of this country.


You have to be
out there, rioting.

Yeah, but that's never
gonna happen, is it?

Oh.

What do you mean?
Of course, it's gonna happen.

Look at the Sandinistas
and Nicaragua.

Yes!

I'm right behind
the Sandinistas,

but there's kids
going without food

in those mining villages
in Yorkshire.

What a bourgeois thing to say.

Stick to making
your little records.

Yeah, fuck off, go on.

Stay away from politics.

Thanks a fucking bunch, boys.

Man! She's right.

<i>â™ª Up and away

<i>â™ª Up and away</i>

<i>â™ª Up and away</i>

<i>â™ª In the cold light of day</i>
You alright, Mary?

Aye, I'm good, and you?

Still teaching?

Aye, primary school.

I can handle
the little school kids.

Keep up the good work, eh?

Children are our future.

(TAP RUNNING)

Alright?

ALEISTER: <i>Please allow me

<i>The name is Aleister,

That's a song title

<i>Ideas are everywhere.</i>

<i>You have only to reach out

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(LAUGHING)
Who is Aleister Crowley?

<i>Aleister Crowley,
author of</i> The Book of Thelema

<i>do what thou wilt, the cultist
and prophet. My hero!</i>

Famous poet, magician, artist.

Your father
has a particular mind.

He only wants what
he believes is best for you.

Oh, yeah!

The Stones
wrote that song about him.

That's right.

I once slept with faith
and found a corpse

in my arms when I awoke.

And yet another night,
I drank and danced with doubt

and found her a virgin
in the morning.

They called him
the wickedest man in the world.

He was into child sacrifice.

No, that's a myth.

He was really talking about...

(CAMERA CLICKS)

You know...

(CAMERA CLICKS)

Wanking.

<i>I was wrong
and handled the narcotics.</i>

Get to fuck.

<i>Calm down.</i>

(PARTY MUSIC PLAYING)

Who's he talking to?

Anyone that'll listen.

Anyone of an independent mind

<i>must be one
who resists authority.</i>

A rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>Take my advice, young man,
let go of your past.</i>

Well, let's round it up
to a nice even number then.

I'll pay you for five next time.

ALEISTER: <i>Stay on the path
you have chosen.</i>

<i>â™ª Rise you make me â™ª</i>

ALEISTER: <i>If enough people
agree with and follow the rebel,</i>

<i>then we finally
achieve greatness.</i>

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

ALAN: <i>Crowley was right,
we were rebels.</i>

<i>So what if you are
going out of business.</i>

<i>We keep doing what we did best,</i>

<i>signing bands</i>

<i>that were fucking genius.</i>

(FAST-PACED MUSIC PLAYING)

(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>We keep running till the wheels

Here's to excess!

Apparently it leads to

William Blake?
(GLASSES CLINKING)

<i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.</i>

He might have been describing
the entertainment industry.

How do you keep the label going?

I have a dream,
we can do this, boys.

ALAN: <i>Well, I gave that speech
about tightening belts,</i>

<i>squeezing money
out of every angle.</i>

<i>Facing the record pluggers,
stepping up fly posting.</i>

<i>Fight of our lives,
all that fanny, and then Ed.</i>

Of all people, Ed pipes up.

Or...

Margaret Thatcher had
introduced this thing called

The Enterprise Allowance Scheme

under
the Conservative Government

allows you to have Â£40
a week extra, it's free money.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Whoever thought I'd be grateful

to this fucking witch.

Only joking,
this bit never happened.


You were running
Creation Records

on Â£40 a week each?

We were the coolest label
on the planet

and running on empty.

(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

Why has he got
such a way with women?

You know why?
Go on.

'Cause he listens,
or rather he pretends to.

It's a bad example, yeah.

Where the fuck have you been?

But what's the point in that?

I mean, look at her, she's not
gonna have sex with him, is she?

Got more chance than you have
talking to Male Silly Bollocks

dancing with himself.

That's what's brilliant
about it.

Lovely talking to you, darling,
sorry your boyfriend's a tosser.

Hey, big day tomorrow. Yeah?

It's fine, I know
what I'm doing, piece of piss.

Are you sure you don't
want me to come with you?

Uh, excuse me?

Alan fucking McGee.

MITCH: <i>I'm not gonna
bullshit you, man,</i>

<i>there's no need.</i>

<i>You know what we do,</i>

<i>and you know
we're fucking good at it.</i>

Let's face it, Al,

you have got a very,
very cool record label.

And with us behind you,

you could become
a very wealthy man.

So, we are owned
by a corporation,

but they let us do
what we like, you know?

The bean counters
just leave us alone

to get on and make great
rock and roll records.

Great!
Good, yeah, fuck!

Yeah, bottom line.

I'm just like you, Al,
a maverick.

Difference is,
I do my thing on the inside,

that's the only way
to get results.

Are you sure? Okay.

People say to me, "Hey, Mitch,
you used to have that

real cool record label,
what happened?"

And I say to them,
"Well, really cool is great,

but it didn't get me
that Chateau in the Ardennes."

Or that Primrose Hill postcode,
you know what I mean?

ALAN: <i>I've got
a vivid imagination.</i>

Everyone wants to get rich, Al.

And if that means
getting fucked in the arse

every once in a while, so what?


But it's the kind of pain
you forget.

Like childbirth.

You alright, Al?

Sorry? Yes.

Uh, what were you saying?

I was saying,
have we got a deal?

ALAN: <i>Corporate
always fucks what's cool.</i>

GEMMA: <i>Wait a minute,
you turned down a deal</i>

<i>from a major record company
and went to a loan shark?</i>

ALAN: <i>Yeah! See, corporations
want to own you forever.</i>

<i>The loan shark
just wants his money back.</i>

<i>It's a more honest transaction.
You don't pay them...</i>

We break your fucking legs.

But eventually, you did
sign with a corporation.

Eventually,
but on our own terms.

We weren't doing it
for ourselves,

we were doing it for the bands.

ALAN: <i>We had a couple of
indie hits in the charts,</i>

<i>I paid them back
and we were flying again.</i>

<i>See, fuck that mullet cunt!</i>

<i>I didn't need a chateau
in the Ardennes,</i>

<i>whatever the fuck that is.</i>

<i>All I needed was
some mothers' little helpers,</i>

<i>Dixies, Damies,</i>

<i>Bobbys, Bennys,</i>

<i>Charlies, Farlies,</i>

<i>Jellys, Fannys,</i>

<i>Red Devils, Black Bombers,
Purple Hearts,</i>

<i>Special Teas,
a wee bit of Les.</i>

<i>Everything was absolutely fine.</i>

(WOMAN SCREAMING)

Exactly how long has he been
in the fucking studio?

Which studio?
This is their fifth.

Kevin Shields is a genius.

Shut up, Ed!

He's absolutely killing us!

You know we're already up to
Â£250,000 in a recording.

He'll fucking ruin us.

There's no fucking end in sight.

Hey Joe,
you get yourself down there,

get on the desk,
you're a brilliant engineer.

You can get this fucking
mixed by the end of the week.

He won't let me near him.

He's not even
returning our calls.

He's got this sonic vision.

Shut up, Ed.

He'll have a fucking hole
in his head when I'm done.

I've had to re-mortgage
my own house.

Jesus.
I know.

You own a house?

I don't need this shit!

My mother's sick
and I've got a money-spunking

mad, fucking genius
who won't return calls.

Fuck this!

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

Excuse me, Sir, can I help?

I'm here to see my band.

Which band?

My Bloody Valentine.

Oh, right, yeah.
Uh, are you Alan McGee?

(BAND MUSIC PLAYING)
Yeah, can you let me in, pal?

Well, I've been instructed
not to.

Instructed not to
instructed by whom?

The band, Mr. Shields.

(BAND MUSIC PLAYING)

Fuck off, jobsworth!

Who do you think's paying
for this fucking studio?

Who do you think's paying
your fucking wages?

Now get in there
and drag that slippery cunt

out here now, Kevin!

If you don't calm down, Sir,
I will have to call the police.

Aye, good idea, call them.
I want to report a robbery.

That's my fucking name,
you've had everything I've got.

<i>Of course, he's a genius,
but two years?</i>

It's not the money
but I suppose it is.

It's gonna cost us
half a million.

But what really hurts
is that we believed in him

and he treats us like this.

I know the man's
a sonic pioneer.

I know
he's pushing the envelope.

I know he's making
futuristic music

but the problem is, by the time
we get to release it,

the future will be
a distant fucking memory.

We'll all be long dead,
I'm not a philistine,

I know art takes time,
but come on, man,

two weeks to master one track,
two fucking weeks.

Oh, cheers, pal, if you can
just drop me here, that's great.

We're not a taxi service.

That's perfect, thanks.

(MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE)

MAN: Not for me,
a load of fucking shit.

<i>But from every negative
comes a positive.</i>

What the fuck is this place?

It's where
the young blokes hang.

This is my scene, man.

Ooh, nice.
Thanks.

(EERIE DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

ALAN: <i>They called it acid house</i>

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

What are you...
What are you drinking?

What's that?

What is it?

ED: Ecstasy.

ALAN: <i>No one
was drinking, just water.</i>

Hydration.

ALAN: <i>I fucking hate water.</i>

Give it 20 minutes.

ALAN: <i>But it was
when ecstasy kicked in</i>

<i>that I really fucking got it.</i>

<i>See, in the old days, it was
cheap speed made in bathtubs.</i>

<i>Or prescription uppers,
Dixies, Bombers,</i>

<i>both of which are
pretty anti-social.</i>

<i>And nobody could afford cocaine,
that was far too chic.</i>

<i>But this stuff, E's,
cheap and friendly.</i>

<i>A revelation and a revolution.</i>

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

<i>It all became clear
in that instant,</i>

<i>pop culture never dies.</i>

<i>It reincarnates.</i>

<i>Everything was
going to be alright.</i>

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

The future has arrived, Ed,

we gotta get Bobby
into this, Gillespie,

he'll fucking love it, man!

ALAN: <i>And then, Ed, again
of all people, Ed pipes up.</i>

We should put acid records out.

Ed, you're a genius, man,
yeah, definitely.

I'm telling you, man,
I've got it all planned.

Definitely.

We can start sampling
bits of film, Alan,

and I know all the DJs.

(NEWS REPORT

All these records that

Where the fuck are we
gonna find the acts, eh?

Manchester.

Manchester?
Yeah.

(MUSIC PLAYING ON TAPE RECORDER)

If I ordered a chicken
sandwich and an egg sandwich,

which one do you reckon

What?

DICK: <i>Alan!
Is he in here, where's Alan?</i>

<i>Is he alone?</i>

JOE: <i>You know what?</i>

He's gone.

He's gone where?

Alan, he's gone.

What do you mean, gone?

Gone to Manchester.

What, for a meeting?

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

ED: <i>Alan feels like
he needs to be submerged</i>

<i>in the waters of acid house.</i>

<i>I wonder where he got that from.</i>

It's him and his fucking
silly bollocks.

Alan doesn't need to be
in Manchester.

He needs to be
in London with us.

Running this
record label, remember?

Good luck trying to
get him back, Dick.

Much better drugs up there.

Yeah, how is it little fishes
can swim with the big sharks

and not get eaten, huh?

Faster, more nimble.

<i>I could be like BMG,

<i>You notice a scene
rising up an A&R,</i>

<i>arsehole has to take it
to an executive arsehole,</i>

<i>who's got to take it
to the chairman arsehole,</i>

<i>and if they agree, they take it
to the lawyer arseholes.</i>

<i>And when that's done,</i>

<i>they all go to
their marketing arseholes</i>

<i>and, when everyone's
got their fingers</i>

<i>out of each other's arseholes,
they might sign a band.</i>

<i>And by then, everyone's
missed the fucking boat.</i>

<i>With Creation, it was just me,
and I'm at the scene.</i>

<i>I had first choice.
I had the artist signed,</i>

<i>recorded, pressed,
and spinning in clubs</i>

<i>before the corporates could
open a bottle of chardonnay.</i>

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

You left your business,

all your stuff,
without any warning.

ALAN: Yeah, well,
that's rock and roll.

It was just like grab a bag

and fuck off someplace,
no planning, no packing.

Shite like that

just vanish.
No, not when you have

a business.

The boys all had it
under control.

Besides, when I got back,
I was totally rejuvenated.

I need that Polygram
contract now!

<i>We were a solvent business,</i>

<i>flying by the seat
of our leather pants, maybe.</i>

<i>But getting away with it.</i>

All right, yeah.
I've got a splitting headache.

I'll get you some water, okay?

There you go.

Taking drugs

It's paracetamol,
he's been having headaches.

Dad, please. Dad. Da.

<i>They say,

<i>losing your mother

Sorry about all this.

I mean,
they insisted on staying.

I can get rid of them
if you want.


Let them sleep.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

We were living
the rock and roll

even more than the bands were.

Surely that made things
harder to get done?

No, not really, because
we only did something

if we really believed in it.

And somehow,
an album would just,

like, appear, materialize,

and suddenly, everything
would just make sense.

<i>â™ª Together as one</i>

<i>Wished that you would have

I'm down to one kidney.

You cunts would have

You off your head?

ALAN: <i>I suppose
we were a victim</i>

<i>of our own success.</i>

<i>Three international hit albums.</i>

<i>We'd done amazing by ourselves.</i>

<i>â™ª Come together as one</i>

ALAN: <i>But we had
to move forward.</i>

<i>â™ª We are together</i>

ALAN: <i>Not for us.</i>

<i>We owed it to the bands

<i>Acts that would never leave,

<i>by the whole world.</i>

<i>â™ª Because together</i>

<i>â™ª We got power</i>

<i>â™ª Apart we got power</i>

<i>and grow up.</i>

<i>â™ª Today on this program

<i>â™ª Gospel</i>

<i>â™ª And rhythm and blues â™ª</i>

So what if we're owned

They let us do
pretty much what we liked,

the bean counters leave us
to get on with making records.

Yeah, but I'm a maverick.
I'm doing my thing inside...

<i>No matter how much smoke
they blew up our asses,</i>

<i>Sony didn't care that we were
the coolest record label</i>

<i>on the planet.</i>

<i>And all the critical acclaim
meant fuck all to them.</i>

<i>We had to deliver a band</i>

<i>that were gonna sell
multi-millions.</i>

<i>A band that could
justify their investment.</i>

<i>â™ª I was blind

<i>on a cheap, away day return.</i>

<i>I hadn't packed a bag,
didn't even have a toothbrush.</i>

(WHISTLE BLOWING)

What time's the next train?

Oh, that's it for tonight.

Next one's 6:00 a.m.

I'll get this one then.

Hold on!
No! Sorry!

Oh! You again,
you jobsworth cunt.

Cunt!

<i>See, this jobsworth prick.</i>

<i>This prick didn't know it,
he changed history.</i>

Fuck!

Fuck you!

All right, Susan.

Yeah, I missed the bloody train.

I know. Got any plans?

Well, if you're not sick of
the sight of me,

I've got 18 Wheeler
playing down at King Tut's.

Get there early,
check out the support, maybe.

Oh, come on, Alan.
Dad's never exactly been good

at showing affection, has he?

Too late for affection,

just appreciate
a wee bit of recognition.

He still thinks
I'm a deluded wee punk.

He does not. He recognizes
you're doing well.

He's just torn.

Torn?

Aye, he doesn't understand
all this music business stuff.

He's frightened you're
gonna fall on your arse.

Ah, see,
he wants me to fall down

and just stay the fuck down,

but I keep getting back up.

He does not. He just wants you
to have a job with security.

ALAN: Security?
Talk about delusional.

I've got a company with Sony,
for fuck's sake.

Oh, I know.

You're Thatcher's little
wet dream you, ain't you?

You're an entrepreneur. (LAUGHS)

I don't care
who you're friends with.

You're not booked.
So you're not playing tonight.

(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

What, you want a slot?

I'll give you a fucking slot
in your throat.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

What are you drinking?

Vodka tonic, please.
I'll get us a seat.

MAN: Fucking cunts.

Double vodka and tonic,

double Jack Daniel's
and Coke, please.

Hey, hey.

You're Alan McGee.

Local boy done good.

What brings you home, pal?

Oh, just a bit
of family business.

Any of this lot yours?

Aye, 18 Wheeler.

And then my pal, Debbie,
is on support.

What was that back at the door?

It's just some Manchester band
giving me some fanny

about saying they were booked
to play tonight,

but it's the first
I've heard of it.

Looked like
it was going to kick off.

Aye.

Hope not tonight though,
because I've got no bouncers.

But don't tell them that.

Better squeeze them
in somewhere.

You don't want a bunch of
Manc scallies kicking off.

Trust me. I lived there.

I will, Al.

Gave them 20 minutes.

Give the DJ time
to go for a shite.

What they called?

Oh, it's a crap name, man.

Oasis.

Malcolm, Malcolm.

Go and have a fag.

It's 20 minutes,
you understand?

We start proceedings with
a band who should be called

Fucking Cheeky Bastards.

I'd like to welcome
to the stage,

Oasis.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Get on with it.

I mean, there's you talking
about the recognition you need

with your own dad, and you're
not even paying attention

to your own wain.

He's just a kid,

and that's your family.

Dad's got a grandson
he doesn't even see.

Do you think that doesn't
disappoint him?

(SUSAN CONTINUES RANTING)

<i>â™ª People say

(SONG ENDS)

Nice one.

Did you hear that?

Yeah. Good band.

Good?
They're fucking amazing.

Hey, man, come here.

Who do I talk to?
What, in the band?

Aye, who's the leader?
Joan of Arc.

He's the only sensible cunt
amongst them.

Do you want a record deal?
You what?

Do you want a record deal?
I'm Alan McGee...

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, cool.

I know who you are.

You're not already signed,
are you?

No.

Have you got a manager?
No.

Do you want a tape?

I don't need a tape,
I've heard and seen enough.

Mate, calm down.

You've had a drink,
and you're a bit excited.

Take a tape.

ALAN: <i>That tape had most of</i>

Definitely Maybe <i>on it.</i>

PRESENTER:
<i>The fastest-selling album ever.</i>

<i>Twenty-five weeks
in the charts,</i>

<i>with singles like...</i>
CROWD: Live Forever!

Rock 'N' Roll Star!

ALAN: <i>See,</i>

<i>Noel had been writing songs
since he was 16,</i>

<i>and Liam...</i>

<i>Liam was just a born rock star.</i>

<i>Give it up for Oasis,</i>

<i>making their TV debut
with</i> Supersonic.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Put this on it.

My bouncer has nicked
the headliner's rider,

so we're gonna do one.

Big fan of your label.

BAND MEMBER: Hey, hey.

ALAN: <i>It was a case
of right place,</i>

<i>right time.</i>

<i>Synchronicity.</i>

Fuck you!

<i>From the moment I was born,</i>

<i>I was meant to miss that train.</i>

<i>Some people's destiny
was to meet particular people,</i>

<i>or go to foreign lands.</i>

<i>But my whole life
had been leading up to me</i>

<i>missing that fucking train.</i>

Now you had one of
the biggest bands in the world.

Finally, bigger than U2.

(BOTH LAUGH)

Where does it go from here?

Well, for me, it's a party
in a club on Sunset.

You coming?

I'd love to,
but I have a deadline.

Hey, can we meet up again
when I'm back in London?

I can do an update piece.

Absolutely.

Oh, if there's one thing I love
more than being talked about,

it's being written about.

I just wish I could write it.

What're you talking about?

It's a puff piece,
mainly photos.

Oh!

Tell them to get the fuck...

Go and sell it to <i>Rolling Stone</i>
or someone.

Tell them Alan McGee
is up there with Brian Epstein,

Peter Grant, Malcolm McLaren,

as one of the greatest
rock managers in history.

That's what
I'd tell them anyway.

You're so modest.

Modesty gets you
nowhere. Listen.

I know
that every fucker out there

knows that I'm talentless.

But I'm a situationist, huh?

Yeah.
I make things happen.

Sheer determination,
I... I get it.

You do.

Well, let's definitely
meet up in London.

I... I might be in a position

where I can write a piece
that matches your ego.

That's a very noble ambition.

Good luck with that.

Hey, oh, can I have my glasses?

Thanks.
Have fun at your party.

ALAN: <i>Like I said, LA,</i>

<i>land of the soulless...</i>

WOMAN: <i>Cheers.</i>

ALAN:
<i>...the vacuous,</i>

<i>the back stabbers,
and, of course...</i>

Oh, hey, man.

ALAN: <i>...the wannabes.</i>

So Noel and Liam,

is it true they just
beat up each other?

What?
The brothers,

do they beat the shit
out of each other on stage.

Right.

(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

Nice shoes.

Oh, you like them?

Got them in Japan.

By some miracle,
they've survived Glastonbury.

Are you English?

Scottish.

Ah.

And this Glastonbury, is it...
Is it close to Liverpool?

I love The Beatles.

It's a festival.

Like Burning Man,
but with rain and mud,

and fucking awful toilets.

Cool!

So, what brings you to LA?

Bit of business.

Huh, yeah,
what is it you do?

I own a record label.

Really?
Hmm.

Wow, that is so interesting

because, um,
I'm a singer-songwriter, um...

Della.

Will you...
Will you take a listen?

I mean, it needs work,

but it has my number
on it on the back.

ALAN: <i>Now,
one of three things</i>

<i>can happen here.</i>

<i>She gets what she wants.</i>


ALAN: <i>I get what I want.</i>

<i>I'm like a cross
between Joni Mitchell</i>

and Patti Smith.

Creation would be
the perfect label for me.

How do you know
I own Creation?

<i>Or, we both get
fuck all and jog on.</i>

Don't try and hustle
a hustler.

I've got people listening
to demos all day long.

Thank you.

Fucking asshole.

Alan!

ALAN: <i>You see this, Charlie?</i>

<i>He's someone else
that's gonna change my life,</i>

<i>and not for the better.</i>

Yo! Cheeky fucking...

ALAN: <i>I couldn't
remember his name</i>

<i>for the life of me.
But when you've done enough drugs...</i>

Rambo, I'm with him.

ALAN:
<i>...you just open your mouth,</i>

<i>and say the first name
that comes into your head.</i>

All right, Ralph?

I was just talking about you
the other day to, um,

oh, what's his name,

tall fucker with the piggy eyes.

How are you, darling.

I'm good, Ralph. You?

Yeah, really great.
Actually, really smashing.

How was rehab?

Fantastic. Best ever.

I'm producing again.

No way!
Yeah, I know.

Back in the zone.
I'm being totally

different this time,
I swear to God.

A little bird told me

you are fucking killing
the music business.

World domination time.

Too modest. Um...

Fancy a cheeky toot?

I shall live and die in LA.

ALAN: <i>There are
a million Ralphs in LA.</i>

<i>Rastafarians who left
the public schools of England</i>

<i>to be Hollywood producers.</i>

Of course, they conned me
out of the inheritance.

But who needs a fucking castle.
Chin-chin.

ALAN: <i>Never seen
a frame of anything</i>

<i>he's produced, and I don't think
anyone else had.</i>

<i>Just met at some forgotten
Hollywood bash somewhere.</i>

<i>That's the thing about cocaine.</i>
Shall we?

ALAN: <i>You end up
sniffing it off toilet seats</i>

<i>with total strangers
who become your best friend</i>

<i>for the next few hours.</i>

RALPH: Ah!

What's your new movie about?

Oh, I met this amazing,
really charming young man

from Compton,
called Hercules the Reaper.


Actually, oh, this place
is absolutely moribund.

Let's go to his club.

Club?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

It's right up your Straza.

Let's go.
Come. Tidy up.

Here we go.

Oh, Christ.

RALPH: Give us
a couple of beers, will you?

This is the life.
Love this town.


So, what is this film?
Is it like some kind of, uh,

documentary or a...
No, it's a biopic.

The story of a man's
incredible life.

Well, it looks like
a vanity project

because he's paying for it all,
but it's not.

<i>Forrest Gump</i> meets
<i>Boyz in the Hood.</i>

<i>Forrest Gump?</i>
RALPH: Yeah.

What's that about, then?
More like a black <i>Forrest Gump</i>

with good music,
you know.

We're lucky,
we'll have them singing songs

and shooting each other
in the playground.

I hate biopics.

Yeah, let's hope nobody else
sings like you, you cunt.

We'll see.
Do you need some music for it?

I don't, what,
your kind of music?

unless you're gonna black up.

(PARTY MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey.

Herc, my brother.

This is my very
good friend, Alan.

Where are you?

He's a major player
in the music biz.

Major.


Thank you.

Hello, how are you?

Ralph tell you?
They're making a movie about me.

What?
A movie, yes.

Some real shit.
Rags to riches.

RALPH: But Alan's
just like you, Herc.

He's from the hood.

What?

Well, in the UK,
we call them council estates,

but they're really
the same thing.

It's just lots of poor people
crammed into suffering together.

Hmm, I'd like to visit
the UK one day.

Not at the moment, though.

Feds won't let me
leave the country.

Oh, the Feds
are persecuting Herc, Alan.

They're all up in his shit.

They won't give
a brother a break, right?

Right, well...

Brother, take it to the VIP.

Laters, homes.

You.

In here.

What's happening?

Whatever you like, my friend.

What happens in Compton,
stays in Compton.


Hello, ladies.
This is my friend, Alan.

He's terribly shy.

MAURICE:

RALPH: Oh, Sleeping Beauty.

Welcome back.
(MAURICE BEATBOXING)

This is Maurice.

Fucking fantastic.

(MAURICE BEATBOXING)
(FLY BUZZING)

I said... I said you might
give him...

Give him a record deal.

Maurice, you haven't already
got a record deal, have you?

Shit. I didn't...
I didn't think of that.

He might... He might already
have a record deal. I don't know.

Ricky ticky tick.
Ricky ticky ticky ticky

ticky ticky tick tick.

Ralph.
This is...

Ralph.

Ricky ticky tick.

Ralph, can I have a wee word?
Yeah, yeah, sure.

As I say, you're on
my soundtrack, I swear.

(SERENE MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

How did we end up
in a fucking crack den?

I know.

It's awesome, isn't it?

(ALAN SIGHING DEEPLY)
Alan, no-one's going to jack you.

They all know
I'm down with Herc's crew.

(ALAN EXHALING)

Looking at that lovely
lolly there, it reminds me,

there's a fabulous
whore house over there

I used to frequent.

Let's pop in for some breakfast
and a happy ending, hmm?

Take...
Take me to the hotel.

All right, Grandpa.

There we go.

Ah, I'm afraid
I can't take you up the hill.

The reverse is a little
unpredictable on this thing.

It's all right.


Oh, well, better out than in,
as Mummy used to say.

Oh, now listen, tonight,
there's a fabulous bash

in Topanga.
Porn producer friend of mine.

Wall to wall totty.

Fancy it?
I'd better not.

Fine, well,
I'll give you a tinkle later,

in case you grow
your cock back.

One for the road?

(L OUD METAL MUSIC PLAYING)

ALAN: <i>I don't believe</i>

<i>that anybody feels
the way I do about you.</i>

<i>Exhaustion, panic attacks.
It's a breakdown, Ed.</i>

<i>Looks like the rock and roll</i>

<i>has finally caught up
with me, eh?</i>

ED: I'm gonna stay with you
as long as it takes.

I need you to get me
the fuck home.

I can't stay here.
This place is evil.

Hey, how you doing?

Nice and cozy.
You're all right, mate.

Just some Valium.

You don't need that.

You know, a fear of flying
comes from

the fear of
not being in control,

and that's caused by
the fear of

not feeling worthy
of your position.

And that leads to
all sorts of things,

like excessive drink,
excessive drug-taking.

For fear of actually
engaging in reality,

because in reality,
we're not in control.

That's why God gave
everyone an ego.

To feel like
we're important enough,

to feel like we're in control.

(SOOTHING MUSIC PLAYING)

That's pretty deep, Ed.

You've got so many people
that love you, so many.

You're gonna get
all the help you need.

I just want you
to get better, Alan.

(SUSAN SOBS)

(PEPPY MUSIC PLAYING)

GEMMA: <i>Heck,
this joint took some finding.</i>

ALAN: <i>Avoid
central London these days.</i>

<i>How long are you in town?</i>

GEMMA: <i>Uh, four days.</i>

<i>I'm doing a piece on
Bono with</i> Rolling Stone.

Ouch!
It's been years.

Tell me about it.

You're doing really well.
I read a lot of your stuff.

That Lou Reed piece.

The memories
of Michael Ronson piece.

You read that?

Hey, I heard that you had
Bill Clinton

come and crash at your house.

He was looking for
somewhere free to crash.

He's a tight cunt like me.

So I think someone from
the Labour Party hooked it up.

Oh, yeah, I wanted to
ask you about that.

You'd taken some time off.

ALAN: <i>Now,
call it what it was.</i>

<i>It was a breakdown.</i>

<i>â™ª She said maybe</i>

ALAN: <i>Agoraphobia.</i>

<i>Or agoraphobia
as the Americans call it,</i>

<i>which makes it sound like
some kind of luxury wool.</i>

<i>No, it ain't woolly.
It's fear and dread.</i>

<i>It's all around you,
and it's far away.</i>

<i>It's just fucking terrible.</i>

I went to therapy,
all that jazz.

Just get better.

Yeah, all right.

See you soon.

(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

Fuck.

Come in, come in.

Oh, no. No, no, no.
No, here.

Oh, sorry.

It's okay.

Talk about predictable, eh?

WOMAN: I suppose I was
feeling extremely pressured.

I mean, my parents
are high-flyers, you know?

And I wanted them to be
proud of my achievements.

All of the time, though.

Did you read the info
on the Alcoholics Anonymous?

I'm with Groucho Marx.

I wouldn't want to join a cult
that would have me as a member.


They're not a cult.

I started self-medicating.

Prozac, Valium, beta-blockers.

Me too, but I was writing
myself prescriptions

for ecstasy, speed,
coke, acid, whiskey,

<i>almost every day.</i>
(BANGING ON DOOR)

I've been trying to
contact you. Where you been?

I've got something here
that'll liven you right up.

ALAN: <i>If there's
one thing dealers hate more</i>

<i>than not being paid,
it's being paid.</i>

<i>You owe them,
they've got the upper hand.</i>

<i>Pay off the debt,
and they lose interest charges.</i>

You don't have to
settle the tab yet.

How much is the tab?
How much?

ALAN: <i>They're
no different to bankers.</i>

<i>It's exactly
the same transaction.</i>

Thank you.

But Alan,
you're my best customer.

There we go.
There we go, all right?

All right, well, look,

give me the money
for that next time.

ALAN: <i>They just
have a better product.</i>

Oh, shit.

(DOOR CREAKS)

That's Alan's dealer.

He's not in the kitchen, is he?

Where is he?

That was my dealer
just round, eh?

Flushed it down the pan.

At least your ones
were over the counter.

(WOMAN SCOFFS)

it's not important

what type of crutches
we all use.

See, what's important
is getting to the root of

why we needed those crutches
in the first place.

TONY BLAIR ON TV: <i>Education,
education and education.</i>

Susan's gone to meet a doctor.
He's got a clinic.

ALAN: <i>Crutches?</i>

<i>Oasis were becoming
the biggest band on the planet,</i>

<i>and here I was,
a shivering mess.</i>

<i>It's like I was throwing
the best party in the world,</i>

<i>but got shit-faced
the night before,</i>

<i>and was too
hungover to join in.</i>

<i>Was I the ghost at the feast,</i>

<i>the mythical creator
of this world,</i>

<i>hosting this party
in my absence?</i>

<i>Truth is, no one gave a fuck.</i>

<i>The party just rolled on,
whether I was there or not.</i>

What the fuck?

I replaced it with cold tea.

You're a man.

It's up to you what you do
with your life, son.

I don't want this to come
across the wrong way, but...

Oh, go on.

Bottom line is,
it was fun.

I was having a good time.

I could afford it.

The only person
I was putting at risk was me.

If someone had said to me,

"Hey, Alan, all that shite
is gonna fuck you up one day,"

well, truth is,
I still would have done it.

And you know something?

If I wasn't
such a fucking lightweight,

I wouldn't be sitting here
right now,

in this circle of whatever.
I'd be out there,

be out there
with my mates, right now.

If I had the constitution
of some of the rock stars

I was looking after,

I'd still be out there,
taking everything in sight.

Hey?

It was exceedingly dull.

It's just noise.
Put it back.

(MIMICKING INSTRUMENTS)
Music does not exist in science.

Why is it, some noise...
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

<i>See, what you call something</i>

<i>completely changes
perceptions of it.</i>

<i>You say "nervous breakdown,"
people think "funny farm",</i>

<i>but you say rehab,
now you're cool.</i>

I've got millions riding
on a bunch of noises

that it's impossible
to even quantify.

It's enough to make anybody
absolutely crackers.

<i>You're an industry casualty.</i>

<i>It's like membership
to the "Terminal Fame Club</i>

<i>"of Rock and Roll Fatality."</i>

I can come back tomorrow,
if you like?

No, I'm good, I'm good.

Everyone's asking about you.

Oh, yeah?
What did you tell them?

That you're ill.

Just tell them the truth, Dick.

It's nothing to be ashamed of.

What, that you're in rehab?

Yeah.

It's pure rock and roll,
isn't it?

Thank God for that.

I was running out of illnesses.
You know, I told <i>The Guardian</i>

that you was having an operation
to remove piles.

Fuck off, what did you
tell them that for?

Well, I had it done.

Could you not
think of something

a bit more sexy than piles?

Well, maybe
we should tell them

that you're having
plastic surgery on your penis.

Okay, tell the world
I've got a tiny cock.

How's that sexy?
No, no, no, no, no.

You're gonna have
a penis reduction.

Christ, Dick, just
stick to the rehab story.

Keep my cock
out of the press.

Okay.

This came for you as well,

It's, um... It's addressed
to you personally.

ALAN: New Labour?

But, it did get me off
the rollercoaster for a while.

<i>As soon as I got out though,</i>

<i>I knew I needed to reconnect.</i>

<i>I started
going to see my bands again.</i>

<i>It felt strange
watching them straight.</i>

(MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>I was still the same Alan.</i>

<i>Only now I was seeing things</i>

<i>that I would remember
the next day,</i>

<i>and most of it...</i>

Till the day
you fucking die.

<i>...wasn't worth remembering.</i>

Just gotta get
in your own world, man,

you know what I mean,
like, sort it out.

Everyone gets told
they're worthless,

you know what I mean,

like, you've gotta prove it,
ain't you?

Maybe one day
they'll sit up and listen.

As you were, Alan.

What's he like, eh?

<i>And I'd lost Joe.</i>

<i>Creation was becoming
too corporate</i>

<i>for our in-house anarchist.</i>

I think this is as much as

Dick could squeeze out,
you know.

I'm sure it's a fortune.

Please stay.

Nah, not for me.

Bloody rock and roll.
All them corporate tosspots.

Been a blast, though.

Yeah.

â™ª Here they come</i>

<i>â™ª La-la-la-la-la-la</i>

Come on!

<i>â™ª La-la-la-la-la-la
The part time punks</i>

ALAN: <i>And there he went,</i>

<i>the world's
wealthiest anarchist.</i>

<i>And in true
unconventional style,</i>

<i>went on to marry a midget.</i>

You know what, Ed?

I just realized I don't know
any of these people.

You resented Sony.

No, it wasn't resentment,
it was more

I'd given my favorite toy
to the big boys.

Now I had nothing left
to play with.

So, is that when you started
getting into politics?

Well, they do say politics
is rock and roll for the ugly.

<i>I started hooking up
with Malcolm McLaren.</i>

<i>Sex Pistols
were my favorite band,</i>

<i>and I was in awe of him.</i>

Ennui's a killer, Alan.
Everything I've done,

the shop, the clothes,
the Sex Pistols,

the opera, the hip-hop,
the art,

was all a reaction
against boredom.

Since man learned to
harness fire,

and build shelter
and clothe and feed himself,

boredom reared its ugly head.

All creativity, all culture
is a reaction against boredom.

You've done hedonism,

and you need to find something
to stop you from falling

into that
claustrophobic comfort.

We are alchemists
of magical stuff.

We take boredom, and we weave it
into a spectrum.

A gift that often bestows.

We are masters
of other people's destiny.

You've always
voted Labour, right?

Mom always voted Labour.

What do you think
about this Tony Blair dude?

I think he's giving them a real
chance of winning the election.

Did Noel agree with you?


Good on him.

Listen, we can help.
They fucking love us.

They want us to get involved.

You can't tell him what to do.

British music brought
Â£8 billion into the...

<i>But you can
lay out the facts</i>

<i>and trust that he'll do exactly
what you want him to do.</i>

We represent all this
cool Britannia bollocks.

They still didn't
win the election.

But they will, this time.

It's fucking obvious
it's the right idea.

PRESENTER:
<i>And the winner is Oasis!</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

Politics isn't that much
different from entertainment.

<i>Seven people
in this room tonight</i>

<i>will give a little bit of hope
to young in this country.</i>

<i>That's me, our kid,
Bonehead, Guigsy,</i>

<i>Alan White, Alan McGee,
and Tony Blair.</i>

<i>And if you've all got
anything about you,</i>

<i>you'll get up there and shake
Tony Blair's hand, man.</i>

Why, because it's like, uh...

It's like selling
an idea, right?

Correct.

Packaging and selling.

Ah, Alastair Campbell,
Communications Director.

We spoke on the phone.
And you are Alan McGee.

Where's Tony?

Oh, Tony can't be with us,
I'm afraid.

Have you met Peter Mandelson?

Mandy!
Mmm-hmm.

We've got Peter to thank
for the modernization

of the Labour Party.

The man is a political genius.

Peter, Alan McGee.

Oh, super.
Man of the hour.

Ah! Dying to meet you, Alan.

Can't tell you how much
we appreciate your help.

(REPORTERS SHOUTING)

Do you really think
that it's a good idea

for pop stars
to get involved in politics?

Do you think you can influence
the future Labour government?

What's in it for you, McGee?

Well, we're all big fans
of The Oasis, and The Blur.

Blur aren't one of my bands.

It's all Britpop, isn't it?

Spice Girls?

No.

MAN: Silly.
(CHUCKLES) Thank you.

Sweet boy,

saving me once again
from humiliation.

Nothing in it for me.

I pay something called
income tax on my earnings.

They're supposed to be spent

helping people
less fortunate than me.

I just want to see others
given a chance.

Not what I was expecting at all.

I'm sure.
I can't imagine any of this lot

on a picket line
or a demonstration.

New Labour.

Modernization.

Can you understand
why some people might think

that this is a publicity stunt?

Some sort of hype?

Creation Records
doesn't need any hype.

We look after the biggest band
on the planet.

Alastair is going to
want to talk to you

about the campaign song.

We're expecting great things.

FEMALE REPORTER: Does this mean
that you might possibly stand

for election yourself one day?

Me?
I think Alan...

Are you taking
the fucking piss?

(ALL LAUGHING)

That's all the questions
we're going to answer right now.

Alan's a very busy man.

(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

I genuinely believed
in Tony Blair.

<i>He was a man that
wanted to progress the party</i>

<i>without scaring away
the working classes.</i>

<i>â™ª In a different life</i>

<i>â™ª In a different light
than I did before</i>

<i>â™ª And I've found the cause â™ª</i>

That's the campaign song
he chose.

Mmm-hmm.

It's house music for people
who hate house music.

Well, somebody
in Peter's team suggested

that maybe Oasis
could do a cover of it

for the campaign theme.

<i>â™ª Things can only get better</i>

Let's face it, that's shite.

<i>â™ª Can only get better
now I found you</i>

<i>â™ª Can only get better â™ª</i>

Under a Labour government,
things can only get better.

<i>â™ª Things can only get better</i>

<i>â™ª Can only get better
now I found you</i>

<i>â™ª Things can only get
Can only get</i>

(PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

ALAN: <i>We helped them win.</i>

<i>We were invited to the podium.
Everybody saw us on TV.</i>

<i>It was all part of the circus.</i>

<i>But then came the invite
to Chequers.</i>

<i>The very private
country residence</i>

<i>of the incumbent
prime minister.</i>

Hello, hello.

ALAN: <i>To walk in the footsteps</i>

<i>of leaders and kings</i>

<i>like Churchill,
Eisenhower, Gorbachev.</i>

Did you know
Tony used to be in a band?

Yes, I heard about that.

<i>Great thinkers
and world leaders discussed</i>

<i>means of peace and laws
for the betterment of mankind.</i>

Now, Kate,
come and let me show you

around our little pad.

You'll love it.

See you boys later.

ALAN: <i>A wee ginger tool
from Glasgow...</i>

What a place
you've got here, Tony.

Oh, it's a bit ostentatious
for my taste,

but, yes, I suppose
it is magnificent.

ALAN: <i>...in the court of kings.</i>

We need to get started
on this new deal

for unemployed musicians
as soon as possible, please.

Right, yes, uh, Chris Smith's
your man. He's not here.

JIMMY: Now then,
now then, now then!

Ha-ha-ha.

TONY: Sir Jimmy.

JIMMY: Anthony, Anthony,
Anthony, my dear boy.

TONY: Ah!

JIMMY: Oh! (CHUCKLES)

Oh, have you met Alan McGee?

JIMMY: I do not believe
he has had the pleasure.

ALAN: <i>Jimmy Saville.</i>

All right?

Um, Mr. Britpop, I presume.

ALAN: <i>Everyone in music knew.</i>

<i>Malcolm told me.</i>

<i>Johnny Rotten even said it
on the BBC in the '70s.</i>

JIMMY: Sir James...

ALAN: <i>It's hard to believe</i>

<i>all these royals
and politicians didn't know.</i>


Excuse me.
JIMMY: Eh?

Oh, yes, the little girl's room

is just across the hall,
young lady.

You'll get used
to the lie of the land,

over the course of the weekend.

CHERIE BLAIR: Tony's band
was called Ugly Rumour.

TONY BLAIR: That's right.

ALAN: <i>Jimmy Savile,</i>

<i>one of the most prolific
child rapists in history.</i>

Did you see the way
Blair was sucking up to him?

Oh, he makes my skin crawl.

You don't understand,

that beast is the sickest cunt
in show business.

What have we done?

Try the chamomile tea.
It's out of this world.

<i>See, this decade,
it started with a bang,</i>

<i>and ended with an explosion.</i>

<i>What we wrestled
out of the hands</i>

<i>of the dullest cunts on earth</i>

<i>got taken back, and they
weren't losing it again.</i>

<i>Corporate disguised itself
as hipster,</i>

<i>and indie just disappeared.</i>

<i>They were gonna do
whatever they wanted,</i>

<i>no matter
what the people thought.</i>

GEMMA ON RECORDING:
<i>My next guest on the couch</i>

<i>is music industry guru,
kingpin,</i>

<i>and former head
of Creation Records,</i>

<i>who brought us the likes
of Primal Scream,</i>

<i>Jesus and Mary Chain,
and, of course, Oasis.</i>

<i>He's political,</i>

<i>occasionally controversial,
and he's a great friend.</i>

<i>He is, of course,
Mr. Alan McGee.</i>

And roll VT.

ALAN: Beaming lights.

PRESENTER: Alan McGee,
the man with a masterplan,

whose Creation Records
went supersonic

by taking him from Brit Rail
employee to Britpop president.

But some might say he went from

rolling with it
to rolling in it,

by selling his shares
little by little to Sony

before collapsing the label.

Did he slide away?
Whoa, wait a minute, whoa.

Is this a stitch-up?

PRESENTER: Leaving
the bands all around

the world without contracts.
What is that?

No.
What is your first question?

PRESENTER:
One thing's for sure.

Creation Records didn't live
forever, know what I mean?

Stop that racket.

You can edit it in afterwards.
What's your first question?

Uh, what
happened with Creation?

Why did you shut it down?

It was mine.

I made it. I folded it.

No one got hurt.

Most of the bands
got re-signed to Sony.

We didn't need Creation anymore.

Yeah, but why kill it?

It doesn't make any sense.

Why not?

Look, I built the biggest
independent record company

out of nothing.

I discovered and signed
the world's biggest act,

and reignited a record industry
I was told was dying.

CD sales went up 800%
between '89 and '99

with me on the charts.

And overseas sales
made the UK more money

than the motor industry.

My bands did that,
and everyone else,

Pulp, Blur, Radiohead,
benefitted.

I got a whole country
into E's and dance music.

And then I got them
into coke and rock and roll.

And once I'd done that,
I got political,

and went and put
some of the biggest cunts

on God's green earth
into government.

Mandy Mandelson, what a tool.


Tony Blair, they made out
they cared about social justice,

when all they cared about
was keeping hold of power

and lining their own pockets.

Who got them to make
a new deal for the musicians?

I did.

Despite George Martin's
objections.

That's government policy.
I changed that.

Anyway, Blair
had me ex-communicated,

because I tried to turn
Malcolm McLaren

into Mayor of London.

Ex-communicated!

Who does he think he is,
the bastard Pope?

See, you give them
a little bit of power,

they lose all touch
with reality.

Christ, look at me!

I lost it
when I got a bit of power

running a record label.

I know how those fuckers think.

Look, Gemma,

there is magic
in this world.

<i>â™ª Hold on</i>
Some people are alchemists.

<i>â™ª Hold on</i>
It chooses you.

<i>You become able to make
things happen because of it.</i>

Able to manifest destiny.<i>
â™ª Don't be scared</i>

<i>â™ª You'll never change...</i>
You see, if I'd fallen off

of that ladder
when I was a kid,

this world
wouldn't be the same.

Everyone I touched,

everyone I worked with...<i>
â™ª May your smile</i>

<i>â™ª Shine on</i>

...gone on, been a success.

<i>â™ª Shine on</i>

Even you, Gem.

It's a Midas touch.<i>
â™ª Your destiny</i>

<i>â™ª May keep you warm â™ª</i>
Excuse me if I'm wary

of what I apply
my skills to next.

That's a lot to take on board

for someone
that hasn't been in your shoes.

But why don't you
try and change

the way that you fit
into your environment,

rather than try and change
your environment?

I mean, friends, family.
Build a bridge.

Don't try and change
the course of the river.

Hmm. (SCOFFS)

Yeah, you're right.

Listen, everybody,
sorry about that.


Scrap that shite.

Let's... Let's go again
from the beginning.

Huh?
Really?

Roll VT.
Did I say that right?

PRODUCER: Roll VT.
Right.

My guest on the couch
is music industry guru,

<i>kingpin, and former head

ALAN: <i>See,
I don't really believe</i>

<i>it's about bridges or rivers.</i>

<i>It took me a long time
to realize.</i>

you push against...</i>

Dad! Dad! Dad!
