Recognize this face?

What did you say this guys name was?

I didn't

His name is Andrew Kunain, he's 27 years old,
family lives near here.

No, Judge de Silva, Andrew de Silva,

his father used to come in here all the time,
buy cigars... Kohibas

Kohibas, the man's got taste.

Well, he was supposed to be some tycoon
in the Philippines or something

And he's rich too.

Yea, but I heard he had to leave the country,

cause he was involved in some
embezzlement of some stocks.

I find out his last place of residence was
some dump in San Diego.

We found a lot of S&M toys.

Ahh, that was Andy.

He loved toys.

A lot of the people I talked to
knew him pretty well.

Seems like he could never tell the truth about himself
for more than 5 minutes at a stretch.

Well, he did make up some fantastic stories.

Most of them were so pretentious,
so phony they were laughable.

I don't know who believed him.

He once told me that he was married to a Jewish woman,

and his father in law was head of Israeli Masondin.

Still I found him so adorable.

You liked him a lot.

Well, he was young, attractive, entertaining,

what's not to like.

Cute and a little mean,
an irresistible combination.

Any way, I just fell in
love with him.

Seems like a lot of your people did.

My people!

People like you... I mean

Ohh, I have nothing more to say, officer.
Uh, I'm not...

Good bye Offcer!
... listen, you know...

Touchy.

Would you please tell us anything
you know about him.

From what I heard, as child he was never
deprived of anything.

He was the only one that the family sent
to private school.

Ohh, he was so flamboyant.

You should have seen the first time
that I met him.

He was beautiful, not just physically.

I mean, he was incredible charming, even when you
knew that he was bullshitting you,

it was still hard to turn yourself off of him.

You saw him in his tailored blazers,
smoking his fat Kohiba cigars.

He made it hard to say no.

Forgive me for being blunt, but are you saying
you had an affair with him?

You're asking me if slept with him?

Uh huh.

I wish!

Nooo.

Guess who, ducky.

Up for a little business tonight?

What kind?

Yea, I thought so...
well, I'll see you at the restaurant.

Ciao.

Shit!

Good evening sir, how are you doing tonight?
Very well.

I'm sorry sir, I didn't see you there.
That's alright, you're forgiven.

Thank you!

Cheers!

Hey, garcon, put this all on
my house account.

Ok, Mr. Kunanin

Presents for later

Ladies and Gentleman, as well as you
not so deliciously gentle,

if I might interrupt the festivities for a moment,

we are gathered here to bid a heartbroken farewell
to one of the most beloved and respected confrers,

an individual of great wit,
a blessing to any gathering.

Where are you off to, Andy?

San Francisco. I've been invited to
the Versace show.

Who invited you?

Gianni!
Gianni Versace?

The man himself.
Vodka cranberry, double!

Where are you really off too, Andy?

I think I found him.
Found who?

Double vodka and cranberry sir.

Thanks. Put the tip on my tab
give yourself a fifty.

Fifty dollars sir?

You heard me!

Jesus Andy, don't you think
you should take it a little easy?

Thank you Mr. Kunanin.
Call me Andy, love.

Think you should take it a little
easy with these too.

Look, I'm flying back to Minnesota,
take care of some business,

bring me back into my millions.

When did you ever touch a million?

Minnesota... more valuable antiques?

Of course!
The only antiquities you're going to find, my dear Andy,

are old gents, filled with even older money.

Ahh, do I detect a note of jealousy, love?

I don't even know you anymore.

People don't know me,
they think they do, but they don't.

Excuse me sir, you have an invitation?
No, but I know Gianni.

What's your name?
Andrew.

I'm sorry sir, but you're not on the list.

Gianni!

Don't you remember me?

Elago de Como?

You remembered. Can I come in?

Sorry sir.
Gianni!

No, no...

...NO! Versace!

Hi everyone...
Mr. Versace has chosen the models for our Milano show.

Congratulations to those that were chosen,
everybody else better luck next time.

Says names...

Ok everybody, follow me now and
I'll give you the information

you'll need for your agencies, this way.
Thank you!

Excuse me, Ms. Versace!
You didn't call my name!

What is your name, young man?

Andrew.
Andrew Kunanin!

I'm sorry but your not on the list.

He promised!

Gianni! Could we talk about it.

No, Buena Sera.

The boy looks good. You don't like him?

Not bad. K
Why not then?

Something in his eyes worries me.

What?
este prea disperat!

Gianni!
Areverdeci!

Donatella, Donatella... he promised!

He promised, he promised... Fuck!

That guy was stupid, the way he pushed himself at you.

Well, Antonio, not every man is born with the genius
of Michelangelo or the brain of Galileo.

Some of them are rejects, desperate people.

Their behavior is motivated by their
own biological juices,

so they maybe they become not
only devils but victims too.

Yes, they too could have become angels,
if not for some superior plan.

We're all in the hands of God.

There's our car.

So how was Italy.

I barely had time to say Hello and then back to Milan.

How are things here?

We'll be ready for the exhibition in Milan and Florence, but
we're going to have to push for Paris.

Then push!

This is my paradise. Miami.

Welcome home Mr. Versace.

So, what shall it be tonight? Prust?

No!...

Antonio, por favore, what are all those
security cameras they put everywhere?

Must we have them. I don't like being
spied on in my own house.

Gianni, that shouldn't bother you.
Ok, ok, but I wouldn't worry about it.

I never worry, except for my mother.

I found it, Truman Capote.

Bella... let's go to bed.

I probably not sleep

You available?

Surprise!

What are you doing here?

You don't look happy to see me.

Andy, it's over.

At least invite me in for a drink?

Nice. Verrry nice.

Wow, you must be doing really well for yourself.

You look tired.

Just came from the airport. Flying tourist with Walmart
crowd can be so exhausting.

Do you have some thing a little stronger
than coke and I don't mean orange juice.

You kept all your bad habits or just that one.

Pour it yourself,
I'm getting dressed.

You know I forgot something.

David, this is for you.

Rolex?

Just a thank you

Thank you for what?

For turning my life around.

Did I, Andy? Did I turn your life around?

Do you like it?

Where'd you get it?
I sold my Mercedes.

I don't want it.

Then why don't you give it to Jeffrey?

Why don't you give it to him yourself?

So you are still together?
Da.

Andy, why do you think I left San Diego?

Because you hated your life there with me and
you wanted to start a new one with Jeffrey.

I couldn't stand watching your little charade, posh parties,
unpaid tabs at the expensive restaurants.

I just couldn't stand watching what you were doing.

To you?

To our friends, Andy, to yourself.

Huh, well at least the sex was good.
Come on... you know I couldn't stand that shit.

What shit?

The S&M, leather, the whips, kinky games, fits of jealous rage,
you almost choked me to death that night.

You're shit was out of control.

So you really didn't care for me, did you.

Andy, I did care for you.

Sky Vodka... cool.

Andy, I still care about you.

So much, that you stole Jeffrey away from me.

I didn't steal anyone away from you.
Jeffrey couldn't stand it anymore than I could.

That's not true.
It is true.

The how and why it happened.

Andy, you don't belong here.

You have to go!

Go where?

Anywhere find your own salvation.

Should I even ask if you have
a place to stay in town?

Well, I do now love.

You haven't changed a bit have you.

You come waltzing in here acting the same way that
made me happy to leave you behind in San Diego.

What did you think you were going
to accomplish by coming in here?

Did you think that I was going to have missed you so much that I'd
be so grateful to have you grace me with your presence,

that I'd fall on my knees and thank God
we were together at last

...where are you Andy... what planet?

I wish that Jeffrey was here so that both of you could nag
at me in stereo. You would like that wouldn't you?

You think I'm enjoying this?

I cared about you. I just can't bide watching
you destroy yourself again.

I guess that's as close to an I love that
I'm going to get this evening.

If you have to, stay here, but,
if you're staying, stay on the sofa.

You know the way I work, when I have an inspiration,

I sleep with it and, if in the morning, the thought
is still in my head, then it's worth working for it.

Come on, let me see.

What did Donatella say?
She thinks it's fine.

I think it's a little to much, Gianni!
It is.

Then it's fine. If I trust my sister, then so should you.

Don't you think this is a bit too much?

But Donatella... if the neckline weren't down to the ankles,
she'd think we were too conservative.

What have I always told you it's never too much,
never too little, never too anything.

For the prices we ask, people want to buy some fun.

And if Madonna buys Versace, everybody buys a Versace.

HAl la cjnckjsv And remember it has to
be ready for the show in New York.

Yes.

Oh, and Antonio, is the cafe open?

The cafe is notorious for being open 24 hours, ahh?

Yea, right I'm still on Italian time.

AN, Miami

Buna ziua, Gianni!
Buna!

Coriere de la serra, La repulica si Junrale.
Here we go.

Mr. Gianni, People magazine just came out and
Madonna's inside wearing your clothes.

Bella

Bonjourno, Sr. Versace

Don't forget to roll your R's my dear.

Bonjourrrrrno, Sr. Versace.
Brava, Brava

Something good?

Madonna looks fantastic in a Versace.
Nu crezi?

Sr. Versace it's so great to have
a star like you here with us.

No, darling, I'm not a star.

I'm just an artist who's been blessed.

A star is someone who spends half of his
life looking for success

...and the other half hiding behind
a pair of dark glasses.

Uhhh, Shit!

Hello.

<i>- Andy, un it's David. I'm going to be late tonight,
can you fend for yourself?</i>

Ahh, how late?

<i>- Late, Late...</i>

Jesus, David.

<i>- Don't get huffy, you're a guest.
We've got a lot to talk about but for now</i>

<i>let me take this at my own pace.</i>

Ok, then, I guess I'll see you when I see you.

"La naiba omule":)))

<i>You've reached Jeffrey, I'm not in,
please leave a message.</i>

Are you still coming Jeffrey,
I REALLY want to see you.

There he is.

All hands, ten but for Admiral Trail.

David?

And how is my admiral, hmm.

Never quite got that far, Andy.

David?

Where is David?

He called just a few minutes ago.
Said he was hung up at the office.

Is that a tired old cliche or what?
How thoughtful.

Let me take these off your hands.

Make yourself comfortable,
I know you know your way around.

David?

...what happened to the TV?

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TV?

Nothing serious, David just got a
little too excited last night.

Now tell me what have you been
doing with yourself?

First, tell me what brings you to Minneapolis?

What do you think?

Disapproval of my drinking, Jeffrey.
You were always fucking disapproving.

Not disapproval, Andy, concern.

You sound like David.

Cause we both cared.

So much that you had to leave?
Maybe we both got sick and tired

...of hearing ourselves talk.

Maybe you and David had more to talk
about amongst your selves.

That's it! Believe what you want to believe,
about us and about yourself.

Look, I'm sorry.

Please don't go.

Wait for David.

Got an idea.
Let me whip something up, spaghetti.

My famous spaghetti.

He's not coming is he?

Well, sooner or later he will.
He does live here.

I just wanted some time to talk.
Just the two of us.

You were my best friend.
Maybe the only true friend I ever had.

And when you left, and then when
David left, do you know how lonely felt?

Not for long I'm sure.
I deserve that.

Look at him. Bless by God. It's so easy for them.

Don't you think you're blessed by God?

Andy, you have all the smarts...

Do I have to hear this fucking lecture again?

Do you know him, Versace, The King of Fashion.

His clothes are shit.

You don't like him?
I hate him!

You hate him, well I think he's great.

I think he's shit!

And you wonder why I walked out on you. This is
exactly what I'm talking about, Andy.

...All you want to do is hear that your
life is hunky dory.

You don't want a friend, just an echo.

You piss and moan about these people on TV having
what you don't have, but you won't work for it.

You'll go down on any old man with a fat wallet. Jesus,
Andy if you'd just did something with yourself.

You have all the gifts, you always did.
You're just too God damned lazy.

Shut up!

No, no not this time, Andy.

You asked me to come here,
you wanted to talk, we're going to talk.

You want it easy, but then you want
sympathy because life's not easy.

Fuck you and David both!

You're two of a kind, you belong together!

You have your nice jobs and you're
nice places to live.

I worked my ass to get where I am.
The naval academy and...

Blah, blah, blah

And so is David you want it easy don't burn
my air because you number didn't come in.

Get the fuck out!

Fine, but don't expect David to put up with
your crap any better than he did in San Diego.

You want to keep playing your poor
little me, nobody loves me.

You're going to be out in the cold, on your own and
I don't think you can hack it on your own.

Oh, no!

Fuck you! Fuck You! Fuck You!

...AND FUCK YOU TOO!

Don't!

Andy, what's going on?

It's not what I wanted.
What happened, what you do.

Oh my God, oh my God?

Cine-i ala, did you kill him?

it's done you don't have to ask yourself how much you
care about me, you say you do.

It's not a matter of caring, this is murder.

It's a matter of killing me, David.
That's the choice.

I can't kill you, that's not a choice.

We all have choices, David,
and all choices have consequences.

...It's your decision!

Breaking News Story, local residence are stunned by
the viciousness of an apparent homicide at the home of

prominent architect, David Madigan.

Sources within the police department have
revealed that as of yet they have

...not confirmed the suspect or the motive.

Get these guys out of here!

Everything's under control...
there's lot blood in there, go see.

Here's my report.

San Diego.
He flew in yesterday. His name's Kunanin.

Andrew Kunanin. Do we have ID reports.

Here it is sir, his airline tickets.

Long way from San Diego. Where did it happen.

In the kitchen.
Good, come on.

Jesus Christ,who's blood is it?

There is no body, I no body was found.

When we got the call, it took us
5 minutes to get here, sir.

We know who owns the house.

Well if the resident was the victim,
his name's David Madsen.

He was an architect.

A resident of Minneapolis for a year and guess what

He's from San Diego?
Yup.

Gay?

If he is, he's still in the closet.

Are we certain that the victim is dead?

If that's his blood, he's dead!

If he looks like this TV,
I'm sure he's dead.

Question is, who was the victim...
Kunanin, Madsen, or a third party.

And who called it in.

A voice at a telephone from some payphone,
wouldn't identify himself

Did we trace the call?

We couldn't, he hung up too quick.
We couldn't get a location.

This is the murder weapon sir.

Jesus... violent

It's Jeffrey you son of a bitch,
you killed Jeffrey!

Now that you know how does that change things?

How do you mean, how does it change things, you freak!
He was my friend, he was your friend!

If he was my friend, he would still be alive.

David, do you think I could've
hurt David unless I had to.

Had to, what the hell could've happened
to make you think you had to.

David, I can't explain it to you right
now because the way you're feeling now

you couldn't possibly understand it.

All I know is that I need your help and, you have to
decide whether or not you're going to give me that help.

I just need a few days and then you can do
whatever you want, tell the cops anything, I don't care.

Please, if we ever meant anything to each other.
Don't pull that shit, not now.

Then why don't I make it easy for you.
No

See you do love me... you have to help

The report goes on to say the police found a bag
with Kunanin's name on it and the remainder...

Stupid asshole, how could you leave that behind?

I can't do this anymore.

Here are the keys, go...
I don't want to know where.

Hey, David!

I like fishing.
Oh, no... Look it's a body!

Let us do our job.
Let's see what we've got.

Madsen, David Madsen.

Alright, take him away.

Here's our second victim.

You find him here too
Yep

Who's this? Jeffrey Gale?
Yep that's him.

So, Andrew Kunanin was in
love with David Madsen.

David Madsen, 33, successful architect,
ex marine, based in SanDiego.

Left town about a year ago to start
his own business in Minneapolis.

He had some kind of relationship
with Jeffrey Gale, anyway,

these two left San Diego and
moved to Minneapolis.

Some of my investigations have led me to
believe that Kunanin may have thought

the relationship they were having
constituted as some sort of betrayal.

Anyway, the truth is we don't know what his motivation
might have been, but we're searching for one.

I'd like to announce now ladies and gentleman,
the beginning of anationwide manhunt for Andrew Kunanin.

I want to wish you all good luck.
Happy hunting.

Thank you.

May I?

Your tush is already in the chair... my name is Giorgio

...my name is Giorgio.
Giorgio Armani?

Ohh, noo, and what is your name young man?
Gianni.

Versace?
Touche!

What about AIDS, isn't that a motivation?

True, we cannot discount the possibility of AIDS.

But there is no solid evidence
that Kunanin is HIV positive

and if so that that's what sparked
his revenge killing spree.

But if that is the case, it will be easy to catch him,
we just have to find his past lovers.

Even if that is the case, it doesn't
answer the question.

Why, why? would AIDS spark him
to be a crazed murderer.

I mean thousands of people have AIDS
and they don't go on killing sprees.

Unbelievable...
here's your money.

Tell me when I'll see you again pal.
In hell!

Only $300...
Fuck!

It is now certain the young man came to Minneapolis
from Southern California, probably San Diego.

The FBI is conducting a nation
wide manhunt for this man.

He was last seen driving through Chicago's gay
neighborhoods in a gray Jeep Cherokee

he allegedly stole from his previous victim.

This young man is known for preying on elderly,
wealthy men.

He is known to be ruthless and
will stop at nothing.

If you see this man you should call the FBI
or your local police immediately.

Fuck!

Stop, come back here you're stealing my car!

Help, help, help

You're not dead yet?

Fuck you!

This will shut you up!

Don't you know life is shit?

Here you go, buddy that's one cranberry vodka,
that'll be four dollars

Shit...

Hey buddy, don't you want change for this

Shit!

I just saw that guy you were looking for.

Yea it was him! In a green Lexus!

Hey you...

Yea, is this your red truck?
Yea, why?

That's why!

What can I tell you...

He can blend into any crowd.

... He could go anywhere,
he doesn't have any strong ties to anyone.

Hang on a second, that's my other phone...

...yea, hold on, hold on... ok,

45 year old care taker, cemetery, William Reese,

predatory...

Yep... so what did he take?

Just a GMC red pick up, 97

The found the Lexus?

Yea, outside the cemetery gate,
and he yanked out the cell phone.

That's to let us know that he knows we're on to him.

Yea, ok, yea, I got it.

The spotted a red 97 GMC truck headed south.

Miami, like any big city in America
has these places...

...what did you call them.

What, enclaves?
Yea, enclaves!

Yea, this is one the capitals of the gay
culture in the United States.

OH no, you have the Village in New York,
West Hollywood in Los Angeles,

You know what, you could be the next
fucking victim so think about it.

Sir, FBI

Yes, I know this man, De Silva

De Silva?
No, Kunanin!

Whatever his name is,
he's no longer in this hotel.

Can you tell us where he went?

No, no I'm sorry, I don't know,
is there something else I can do for you?

No nothing, we're late again

Permiso?

Gracias, adios

Housekeeping

Go away!

You people are the FBI!
You're supposed to be the best!

I've a spree killer loose in my city and you
don't have a clue where the fucking bastard is!

What I really mean is, that we've got this
guy who hasn't been all that sneaky,

he's been walking around practically with a
sign on him that says "Me Killer, You Victim"

...still, we can't find him. You FBI honchos,
the best of best have been in town 2 weeks already

...and you have NOTHING, WHY, dammit, why?

Why don't you tell us why, Chief?

Look at this we're talking about island
that's only 7 miles long

with a transient population that fluctuates constantly.

We got tourists from all the world, we've got
a pretty high flying gay community,

we've got a pretty high flying straight community,
we got a large Latino immigration population

we're talking about a city that hasn't
looked the same two days in a row

Tell me something Chief where are all the
flyers I told you to print up, huh?

I haven't seen a fucking flyer anywhere!

Well, that's not exactly true, is it?
No?

Remember that it was the flyer
that alerted the Pawn Clerk.

So, these fucking flyers are supposed
to be papered all over street corner,

warning people about this nutcase, now we
didn't even see any for at least a week

There out there now!
Good!

Look, this kind of massive alarm
is just a logistical nightmare!

Wait a minute...
Oh really

Law enforcement is just like every other
government agency, it's a damn bureaucracy

...it's what help up Kunanin's prints at the
Pawn shop, it's what help up the damn flyers

everything takes a long time
to get done,

down here in the South cause
everyone's so sun struck

no, everyone's so FUCKING LAZY!

Listen you guys, I know the beach
like the palm of my hand and

I'm telling you I don't what it good it's goin
to do to paper theplace with flyers.

People hang out here to have
a good time gay or straight.

Nobody wants to hear bad news.

If own a club, a bar, a restaurant,

what the hell do you think it's going to do for your business
to hang a flyer in the window that says,

"Oh, by the way, we have a
killer lose in the neighborhood!"

What can I help you with?

Tuna sandwich on rye, to go

Tuna sandwich? On rye? To go?
Yea

Hey, hey?

Where the hell is my sandwich?
It's coming right up

You know what, eat it yourself,
shithead.

Political Science.

the semester starts.

OH, dorm life, don't you love it?

Dorm life, oh, Ms. Thang, that's so de clase

I have an apartment at the Forte towers.

Really, I have a lot of great friends
who live at the Forte Towers,

...what floor are on?

You know a friend set it up for
me and I really haven't been there,

so watch me not be able to find my own place.

well listen, I've gotta go, ok

baby, we'll talk later or
something like that.

I've got things I've gotta do.

We can talk some other time.

Sure, we'll hook up.

This week looks bad for me, but I guarantee
you'll hear from me again.

Ok, buh bye!

Where'd the bitch go?

Who cares! Fuckin' whore!

sweetie, what took you boys so long?

It's been 20minutes
my God!

What'd you think he was going to do?

Take an electric chair and wait
for you to get here?

Where is he?

Out killing Miami Beaches' chief
of police for all I care.

I'm the fucking Chief of Police

Then you'd better watch out.
Thank you very much

Thank you

You sure it was him?

Roller blades?

Now what would he be doing
on roller blades?

Come on, now do me a favor and
just stay there

and keep your eyes peeled, alright.

Do you mind? My desk please?

Why, of course, Chief.

So, what's up?

Well, we're slowly closing in on him.
slowly?

What, we play low key and
hope to lure him out?

Or turn up the
heat and flush him out?

No, now that we've got him in ou
sights I'm afraid to do anything

that would make him move
cause then we'll lose him again.

Look this guy's desperate and he's broke
and he knows we're closing in on him.

I don't think he can get out of Miami.

I say se turn up the heat, we hit the
street and we coordinate a search

like Miami has never seen before.

God dammit!
What's a matter?

Well, he's gotta figure we're closing in
on him and he's gotta be worried

What do you mean?

Kunanin loves being center stage right?

If he figures the show is
just about over,

I'm afraid he's going to plan to go out with a
big bang and makes sure the world never forgets

Kunanin's room is right around the corner.

Damn!

We're late again!

Don't forget to let us know if he comes back
for his things, alright.

Mario, fetch a car

Mario, don't fetch a car,
we can walk to the cafe.

We're going to be late
to the movies.

No, we have time

Gianni, what is it?

-That guy on roller blades

... I've seen him somewhere before.

You look worried.

I can't explain why,
but yes,

I feel troubled

You have no peace since you
came from Europe.

Gianni, I see a
constant cloud in your face.

-Maybe there is no peace on earth

for those who are too successful.

You've seen millionsof faces
in your life...

Buena sera, Gianni

Welcome home

Salud

It was glorious.

 It was like being on another planet.

It is a shame you must come
back to earth.

No really, earth is not that bad
...you know.

According to the saints and
the sages, 

...to belong to the earth is part of the
grand design of nature.

Now, don't you feel better?

Here's your margarita Mr. Versace

How many times have I told you
to roll your r's?

MARRRRGARRRITA

Ok, let's rush, I don't want to miss

the beginning of the movie.

3 for contact.

$18 please

... thank you.

Has the early show started?
No, but it's about to.

Is it crowded?
Are you kidding?

On a Monday night? The three of you
could spread across six seats.

Gianni!

Coming

Good morning, you're up early

There are already people on
the beach.

I'm going to take my 
walk to the News Cafe.

Call ahead to prepare my magazines
and a couple of croissants.

Ok, I'll prepare breakfast.

Mr. Versace!

I saw your Paris show on TV

VERY NICE!

I think you're out of this world,
Mr. Versace.

Thank you.

Bonjourno ... Mr. Versace,
here's your magazines

Mr. Versace ... here's the
croissants you ordered.

Everything alright, you're
not smiling

Ah, one of those days..

You didn't walk your normal
route this morning.

Maybe, I wanted to be closer
to the ocean.

Ciao

Gianni, no

I saw him, I saw him running
that way.

Where's Versace

He's in number eight

Somebody brought in Gianni
Versace

I'm sorry, you can't be in here,

 you'll have to wait in the
waiting room.

I'll send out a doctor as soon as
we know anything

It's ok Antonio, we'll have to wait.
It'll be ok Antonio

Doctor, can you tell us his
condition?

This is a hospital, please
quite down.

Is there anybody here that's the
family of Gianni Versace?

I am Antonio DeMico,
I am, I am family.

I am Jamie Cordona,
I am family.

Mr. DeMico, Mr. Cordona, I am sorry
to tell you that

 Mr. Versace is no longer
with us.

Doctor, please, can you give
us a statement?

Yes, yes, I can.

Mr. Versace was in cardiac arrest whe
they brought him in 

his heart had stopped about
20 minutes before they brought him in.

He was systematically brain
dead at the time

Mr. DeMico, please give
us a comment.

I'm sure the whole world is
waiting to hear

the reaction of a close 
member of the Versace family.

What can I say?

There are no words to describe
this kind of tragedy. 

I am devastated.

My heart is bleeding.

I just want to die

Hey, it's me Andy.

 I didn't know who else to call.
 I need a passport.

<i> Andy you can't be serious.</i>

It's just a passport!

<i> My God Andy! Everyone in the world
is looking for you.</i>

That's why I need your
fucking passport!

<i> I can't Andy, I just can't!</i>

Is there somebody else I can call?

<i> I'm sorry Andy...</i>

You don't know how sorry
you're going to be!

Ladies and gentlemen, please
hold your questions.

The spree murderer has been identified
as Andrew Kunanin

...of San Diego, California.

Kunanin has been on the top of the FBI's most
wanted list for several weeks now.

I'd like to turn it over now to special
agents' John Jacoby

and Bernie Rogers of the FBI.

Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.

Our ballistics reports indicate
that the bullets found

in the body of Gianni Versace
match the ones found

 in the victims David Madsen of Minneapolis

and William Reese of New Jersey
killed earlier this month.

We believe that Kunanin is till on the island.

How can you be so sure, Agent Jacoby?

Well, for one, we have found a vehicle
in a parking garage on Collins Avenue, 

the vehicle is a red GMC pickup and belonged
to Mr. William Reese of New Jersey.

vicivsvnsdsds

In addition, we have been combing
Miami Int'l Airport

since this morning and have found nothing.

WHAT IS YOUR PLAN?
WHAT IS THE FBI'S PLAN?

Who's the next victim? Madonna?

Very funny

We have a plan...

...a very good one.

Now if you'll all just be
patient,

we'll get information to you as
soon as it comes up.

Thank you.

Hello...
yea, this is detective Rogers.

Yes mam.

You saw Kunanin...

...you saw him in, in,
in Israel.

I believe you.

Believe me, I believe you.
Would you hold on please.

We don't expect to see Kunanin

...this guy says he saw Kunanin
 in Alaska!

Hold on mam 

Hey, what you doin here?

 GET OUT!

No! You get out!

Shit!

Yea, yea, I've got that sir.
And your phone number is?

Take you time, slowly sir!

Speak English, please,
only English

Wait, hold it sir.

My name is Fernando Garrerra,

yes,... I am the caretaker of
the houseboat, in the beach

I go inside the house...

I walk in...
... I didn't know.

I look up and there's a man with a gun,
he shoots at me `Bang', I run

What do you mean,
shot at you?

The bullets fly over me...

Who shot at you?
The man in the TV

Where are you?

In the houseboat, in Miami Beach

WHERE, WHERE!?

At 5215 Collins Avenue

Are you sure it was Kunanin?

Alright, slow down now, please,
only English.

I am telling you, he is the
man on the TV,

...I see all the time 2, 3
days ... he's here!

Alright, alright sir.

We got him

Fuck you...

...FUCK YOU ALL!

I am Fernando Garrerra,
he's still inside the boat.

Seems like we're late again

I think you're right.

You guys take it in

...you guys stay back

It's him... Andrew Kunanin

God damn him!

It's a Versace!

You think they knew each other?

I don't know.

That's funny... I heard two shots. 

He had to be dead after the first one.

Maybe somebody else killed him.

da...Maybe ...

Excuse me, I was just wondering
what you're doing here?

I'm here for my Gianni.

Did you know him?

Yes

God Bless you.

See what Kunanin did?

Well, the way Kunanin lived,
as far as I've seen it,

is fuck you to people and that's
the way he died.

You want answers, you want to
know why, well FUCK YOU.

Reason people want to know is because
you get this fear about the guy next to you,

right, and you wonder what could make
somebody become this kind of horror.

There just looking for something, you know,
it's an omen, a danger sign, a red flag.

Damn!

It's funny. It's like there
were mirror images of each other.

Gianni Versace was this successful,
powerful, brilliant gay man

which is everything that Kunanin wanted
to be but couldn't become,

so he had to do the only thing
 he knew how to do,

which was steal somebody else's fame.

Yea!

We are people hooked on celebrity.

We buy supermarket
tabloids, we're addicted.

There's no sense to it.

That we're more interested in movie stars,
 fashion designers

and tycoons than brain surgeons.

And any student of religion can tell you that
people create their own God

if that's kind of people we are then somebody
like Andrew Kunanin was inevitable.

Maybe one day the Devil will change
back into in an angel.

Unfortunately, it won't be
in our time.
