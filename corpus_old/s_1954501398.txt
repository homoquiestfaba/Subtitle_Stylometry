  Â¶ Sometimes when I wake up,
     I just feel so high Â¶

  Â¶ I feel like walking on top
       of a rainbow sky Â¶

  Â¶ Where the grass don't grow
        and women know Â¶

       Â¶ Time flies by Â¶

       Â¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh Â¶

  Â¶ I move my hips down low Â¶

          Â¶ So-o-o-o Â¶

  Â¶ You'll notice where I go Â¶

     Â¶ And when the lights
      are low, low, low Â¶

        (Phone ringing)

   Â¶ You're gonna pick me up
     and never let me go Â¶

             WOMAN:
       Brandy. Hey, girl.

      BRANDY, OVER PHONE:
   <i> Hey, girl. Where you at?</i>

    Yeah, hey. We're, uh...

       we're still about
  eight hours outside Houston.

       <i> Are y'all driving</i>
       <i> straight through?</i>


Yeah, we're going to stop,

       maybe grab a bite,
    clean up a bit and then,

  you know, we'll see my dad,

   we'll spend a night or two
             there,

   and then we'll be in L.A.
    by the end of the week.

   Just in time for that<i> CSI</i>
            audition.

                      (Exhaling)

  Babe, can you put that out?

            Goddamn.

  <i> You guys find a place yet?</i>
           Koreatown.

      Sandra got us a cute
         little studio.

              <i> Oh.</i>
             I know.

 Um, but, you know, we're still
   on a really tight budget.

 I have a couple thousand saved
     from my student loans,

and what Kevin saved up
       this past

year while I was
finishing school.

         <i> You're happy?</i>
          Yeah, we are.

          <i> And Kevin?</i>
 He's helping me with my lines.

         He's the best
        boyfriend ever.

           <i> Exciting.</i>
 Okay, yeah.

We're really excited
  to see you too.

       <i> Okay. Bye, chica.</i>
           Bye, girl.

       Â¶ To sing a song Â¶

       Â¶ To sing a song Â¶

   Â¶ We're gonna pick me up Â¶

    Â¶ And never let me go Â¶

      Â¶ Because the day Â¶

        Â¶ Is long gone Â¶

       Â¶ And yesterday Â¶

   Â¶ Will never come again Â¶

    Â¶ There is no right... Â¶

              You're killing me.

               What do you think
               about the script?

Honestly?

                    Is that bad?

It's wonderful.

               I thought so too.


Kevin...

What's this?

                        A box...

                 made for rings.

Oh, my...

                 I wanted to ask
                 your dad first,

            but I couldn't wait.

  I can't wait to spend the rest
       of my life with you.

   Â¶ You're gonna pick me up
     and never let me go Â¶


   Â¶ You're gonna pick me up
     and never let me go Â¶

  Â¶ You're gonna pick me up Â¶

    Â¶ And never let me go Â¶

        All right, go tell them.

           I'll get the luggage.

       (Doorbell ringing)

                     Daddy? Dad.

       It's Mo and Kevin.

His car's still
in the garage.

                    Call Billie.

Aunt Billie?

Where's Daddy?

    I should have been here
           with you.

I'm sorry.

I was planning on telling you
     when you got here.

And I was coping just fine
     till last night.

       Billie should have
           called me.

This isn't her fault.

This was my decision,
   and mine alone.

 Well, I could have, you know,
     been here with you...

            helping.

What could you have done?

     I would have made you
         do the chemo.

Sweetheart, I taught you never
  to give up on your dreams

because you feel obligated
        to a man.

And that includes me.

    We should have at least
         discussed it.

There's nothing
they could do.

           (Sighing)

              Dad.

Hey, what's this?

Kevin, come here.

     I'm really sorry, sir.

        I wanted to wait
       to ask you first.

Enough of that "sir" stuff.

From now on...

                Oh, my God. Dad!

                          Dad...

                       Nu-Nurse?

                          Nurse?

Come on.

Whoo!

              Dad?
I'm okay, honey.

Sit down. I'm okay.

       Her mama
really liked you, son.

Congratulations.

           Thank you.

                 We can't leave.

I know.

        How long do you think
     they'll hold our apartment?

I mean, they have our deposit,
      so, uh, you know,

maybe a month.

                   What about
                your fellowship?

It's unpaid anyway.

                  You should go.

              That's the perfect
                 opportunity.

I'm not leaving.

                But you saved up
                  all last year

               so you could take
               that opportunity.

With you.

That's our money.

It's for our future.

                     I love you.

I love you, babe.
                            Hmm.

                     Miss Moore?
              Yes?

Hi, I'm Dr. Jones, your father's
      attending physician.

                   I missed you
                  the other day.

            Um, Dr. Cook,
     the hospital administrator,

                needs to see you
                   right away.

             Is there a problem?
Well, Monica,

your father's benefits have run
 out for his hospital coverage.

      It would only cover
         hospice care.

    I-- I don't understand.

   This is an itemized sheet,

  showing that he's exhausted
    his acute care coverage

        in the hospital.

    But we have an excellent
     hospice program here.

 Of course, it could be costly
          for patients

who don't have outside coverage
 or assistance, you understand.

        How much are we talking?

   Well, it's a considerable
            amount.

      You know,
it depends on factors

 like how long he'll be here,
which could be several months.

          There's also
       home hospice care.

     We could have someone
 take care of him at the house.

              No.

                         Monica?
              No.

         No. If my dad
       is dying this way,

we are getting him the very best
      care until the end.

     Until the end, Kevin.

    I have some money saved.

                    We have some
                    money saved.

Okay.

   We have to come up with...

            $15,000,

 which has to be paid at once.

      And then, of course,
 there's next month's billing.

            15,000?

            COOK:
It's all right there, Monica.

And I wish I could pay
     half of it.

Not a fun part
  of my job.

But the facts
are the facts,

           so we have
       to figure it out.

    Okay. Uh, not a problem.

 We'll have the cheque for you
        in the morning.

                       Let's go.

                     You said...

It's our money. I know.

                        $15,000.

                   That's half
                 of our savings.

It's okay.

             I'm selling my car.

            I'm paying you back.

                      I promise.

        Well, who's that
        handsome fella?

       Is that my Kevin?

Hey, Billie.
                             Hi.

             How you holding up?

It that your famous
  tuna casserole?

                    You know it.
Well, then I'd say things

just got considerably better.
                      (Laughing)

Let me bring you to Monica.
             Okay.

                       (Sighing)

                 I'm going to go
                  check on Dad.

              The tuna casserole
                 was terrific.

Thanks, darling.

              Be there in a bit.

                       (Sighing)

           This is going to take
            everything we have.

                  And then some.

                       (Sighing)

         We need to get him
    the best treatment there is.

                 I don't care
              what I have to do.

    Don't you think
I love my brother enough

to make that happen?

 You were in junior high
when your mother got sick.

I was the one there,

      helping your dad
make all the hard decisions.

In his first bout
  with cancer,

I was the one that was
   cleaning bedpans

and helping raise you.

So don't come around here

spending money you know
    you don't have,

like you're the only one
   that gives a damn.


Look...

sweetie.

You've got Kevin
to think of too.

  I mean, he has put
his entire life on hold

    to stay in Tallahassee
so that you can finish school.

And he is doing it again.

For you and your father.

That is a good man.

As hard as you're fighting
     for your father,

 you need to protect
your relationship too.


Monica Moore?

                          Tasha?

Yes.

                             Hi.
Hey.

Mwah. Oh!

               You look amazing.

         I hardly recognize you.

  I mean, I'd ask how you are,
but obviously you're doing well.

I am.

Okay, so tell me,
   what is new

with HSPDAs favourite
    Ophelia, huh?

You still at FSU?

                     I was.
               I just graduated.

Big part (Unclear)?

                   Oh, this.
               My fiancÃ©, Kevin,

   he-- It's one of his scripts.
        He's a screenwriter.

Cool. The dynamic duo
    or something?

Okay, so why y'all
   in Houston?

       (Snapping fingers)
    Ah, ah, ah, ah. Monica.

         Stop talking.

       Get back to work.

You work here?

                   Mani or pedi?

               This ain't right.

         Come on, tell me, girl.
             What's going on?

          Dad's sick.

  Kevin and I actually thought
   we were on our way to L.A.

   and just passing through.

         Oh, my-- He's been sick
         since high school, huh?

                   I'm so sorry.
Thanks.

       I mean, you know,
  it's a rough time for sure.

     There aren't many gigs
           in Houston

 for a highly educated actress.

      I mean, Aunt Billie
     got me this job here,

    but it barely scratches
 the surface of Daddy's bills.

                You ever thought
                 about dancing?

               I've been working

        over at Hidden Treasures
            for a while now.

         I could talk to my boss
                 for you.

  Uh, I don't know that Kevin
    would ever let me strip.

         Why not? Y'all can make
               quick money?

          Take care of you
   and your dad's medical bills.

         I don't know.
    It sounds kind of dirty,

      showing my vajayjay
    to a bunch of perverts.

          No offence.

                    (Laughing):
                  Your vajayjay.

  It's a topless bar only, okay?

            The clientele,
     they're not some hood rats.

            They're businessmen.
             They're executives.

                    Contractors.

                  Seriously,
              it pays the bills.

          Takes care of my rent,
                my tuition.

          Fills my refrigerator.

            Doesn't even include
                 the perks.

                 Whatever.
          It's not for everyone.

                 Think about it.

                           Okay?

Okay.

                      Thank you.

         See you, girl!

Girl, see what
hard work does?

Pays off well.

Hard work, good tips.

               Â¶

      What am I thinking?

Monica.

                           Shit.

Monica Moore.

Hey, girl.

                            Hey!
Hi.

What's going on?

Change your mind?

               No, I stopped by
              to return the tip.

                It was too much.

      Come on,
it's not pity money.

  Just helping
a girlfriend out.

Seriously, want to come in?

           I got a bus to catch.

Really?

  Come on, I'll give you
a ride home. Check it out.

                           Okay.
Okay.

     I usually work nights,

    but I just have to pick
         something up.

       You want a drink?

  Okay, give me just a minute.

    (Hip-hop music playing)

             EMCEE:
       Two for one drinks
     till Friday night now.

   Â¶ Take it to the ground Â¶

 Â¶ Show me that you know how Â¶

             Â¶ If you're ready Â¶
        Â¶ Let's be out Â¶

      Â¶ Take you straight
         to the house Â¶

     Â¶ Let me open up that
       brown, brown... Â¶

             EMCEE:
    Up on the main stage...

   Â¶ What's my name again? Â¶

Only a thousand
  this time?


Just kidding, sweetie.

   Don't forget now, I'm only
   working nights next week.

     Okay, you ready to go?

                   What's wrong?

I hate the smell
of nail polish.

                      (Laughing)

         Is it hard,
dancing for those strange men?

           Maybe the first time.
               But that's it.

        I mean, after that it's,
               you know...

                   What is wrong
                     with you?

     My daddy's latest bill
just came in the mail yesterday.

You really make all that money
     by dancing on stage?

                        Sort of.

                  Brandy booked
                 that<i> CSI</i> pilot.

               I know I would
           have gotten that gig.

You would have.

         Sandra said Brandy
   screwed the casting director.

      I mean, at least if you're
          going to have sex,

 you might as well get something
        out of it, right?

Where is this coming from?

  God, I just miss performing.

    I mean, at least you can
          still write,

       even in the midst
          of all this.

Why are you being
   like this?

       I'm just thinking
      about Daddy's bills.

Well, when I sell my script,

     we're going to have
all the money we ever needed.

     But we need money now.

                       (Sighing)

              I...

        I think I could
      make money dancing.

With a dance company?

              No.

     Tasha showed me around
  the club that she works at.

          You know...

        I mean, at first
       it seemed strange.

          I was like,
       Can this be legal?

             But...

  after a few minutes, I mean,
  it all seemed pretty normal.

You went to a strip club?

   I saw a guy just give a chick
               $300.

                And Tasha said
              on the night shift

          that you can make
     up to $700 or more a night.

    I mean, I figure if I danced
             every day,

  I could make back our 30 grand
     in less than two months,

          and pay Daddy's bills,
            and then maybe even

 swing a few flights out to L.A.
          for auditions.

              Or for you to take
                   meetings.

   Just until things get settled
            with Daddy.

        And then we'll move out,
          you know, as planned.

    Â¶ Drinking muddy water Â¶

   Â¶ And sweet, sweet wine Â¶

     Â¶ Why would you put it
         to the test? Â¶

   Â¶ You're going to whip up
         such a mess Â¶

  Â¶ What in God's green world
      were you thinking? Â¶

     Â¶ What kind of poison
is your pretty mind drinking? Â¶

  Â¶ Well, anything you want Â¶

     Â¶ Anything you want Â¶

          Â¶ Is yours Â¶

    Â¶ All you've got to be Â¶

     Â¶ All you've got to be
           is sure Â¶

                   What the fuck
                      is this?

                 (Keys jiggling)

   (Flipping light switches)

                  Light are off.

         (Both sighing)

                        Kevin...

Yeah?

              I've been thinking
                about the club.

      I mean, it's not that much
        different than acting.

       It's just playing a role.

      I went topless in two
of your student films, remember?

      Besides, it's quick money.

I know this guy at work.

He sells weed on the side.

              Quick legal money.

               I'm about to lose
                    my Dad.

                 What would I do
                 if you got shot

              or landed in jail?

It's not going to happen.
     It's just weed.

     No. Dancing is the only way
         to make money fast.

                And you know it.

    This isn't just about Daddy.
          This is about us.

           If we get stuck here,
             we'll never leave.


We can try it
 for a week.

                      (Laughing)

I promised your dad

  I wouldn't let you
give up on your dreams

and while I'm making progress,
        you're saving.

And besides, I always wanted
sexy lap dance from my baby.

                           Okay.

There's got to be
 some rules now.

                           Okay.

There's no dancing at that club
       if I'm not there.

         What if you're at work?
We'll figure it out.

I'll be there to walk you
  to and from the car,

otherwise it's just not safe.

             Okay.

    And as soon as I've made
    enough money, we're out.

Number two, there's no drinking
   at that club, all right?

Stay sharp. It's just work.

Number three:

      no outside parties,

              VIP.
          MONICA: Ew.

  You think I want some creep
       to finger-bang me?

No, just...

     just stage
and lap dances only.

Number four: we don't see
  anybody from the club

outside the club.

           (No audio)

And number five:

no drugs.

        You are the one
       that smokes weed.

I do smoke weed.

And lastly...

     no turning me down
when I want some good loving.

             Okay.

And that last rule
starts right now.

      Thank you for being
         so open-minded

    and wanting to try this.

         And I promise

       you'll get plenty
      of good love-making.

             KEVIN:
       I better get that.

   Â¶ W-W-W-W-Work it, girl Â¶

       Â¶ Work it, girl Â¶

  Â¶ Your body perfect, girl Â¶

  Â¶ Ooh, you a working girl Â¶

        Â¶ Twerk it, girl
        twerk it, girl Â¶

  Â¶ Your body perfect, girl Â¶

  Â¶ Ooh, you a working girl Â¶

        Â¶ Work it, girl
        work it, girl Â¶

  Â¶ Your body perfect, girl Â¶

  Â¶ Ooh, you a working girl Â¶

        Â¶ Twerk it, girl
        twerk it, girl Â¶

  Â¶ Your body perfect, girl Â¶

  Â¶ Ooh, you a working girl Â¶

      (Cell phone ringing)

           You want to get that?

Uh, no, no. I'm good.
 We're good. Sorry.

                Still no answer?
No.

   So, what? If he doesn't show
 you're just not going to dance?

I promised him I wouldn't.

   Hmm. Good luck with that.

What does that mean?

   Girl, having your man sit
 in the club while you dancing?

   That's going to throw you
         off your game.

        Going to put you
     on Matt E.'s bad list.

    Cost you a high roller.

High roller?

        We got a regular client,
                well off.

                 You know,
           they're a high score.

   You see my girl out there
        on stage, Lexus?

    She is a top moneymaker.

     She got Chicago, girl.

  The finest man in the city.

           Baby Girl,
        you're up in 10.

        And you'd better tip out
          when you dance here.

What's her problem?

          She just mad
     because she can't work

       that pole no more.

       So, you going on?

      (Cell phone ringing)
Um...

I-- I apologize.

    You know,
I need 30 seconds.

                       Go ahead.

Uh, hey, babe.
      Babe, where are you?

The meeting just started
    20 minutes ago.

      Did you get the job?

Um, I don't know.

 He's just looking
at the storyboards.

  Well, I'm on in 10 minutes.
   What do you want me to do?

            <i> Kevin,</i>

 we've been working up for this
      the past two weeks.

       If I chicken out,
        they'll fire me.

Uh...

you know, just--

Just do it.

I'll get there when I can.

         Are you sure?

Yeah.

       Okay. I got to go.

Monica?
             What?

I love you.
           Okay, bye.

            Â¶ Yeah Â¶

             Â¶ Ah Â¶

Monica?

Monica Moore?

              No.

   Sherry. My name is Sherry.

              Oh.

       How long you been
     dancing here, Sherry?

         Since tonight.

That's crazy. You look exactly
        like this girl

I went to junior high with.
I had a huge crush on her.

I want five songs.

        They're 20 each.
       That's like $100.

I know how much they are.

                        What...?

        Wait. You can't do that.

What the fuck are you doing?

        What's going on?

I want my money back.
 What are you doing?

   He had his hands all over me.
          Can he do that?

   Uh, can I just steal her away
       for a second, boo-boo?

Yeah, yeah.
                   Thanks, baby.

What are you doing?

                He had his hands
                  all over me.

Okay, well, Matt E. let's them
touch anything but the na-na.

  Okay? So when you're
on the floor, that fine.

In the VIP...

              I don't remember
            you telling me that.

Well, I did tell you that.

 Okay, dancing on the main stage
             is okay,

        but walking the floor
     is hustling for lap dances?

Monica, calm down, okay?
                  I can't do it.

         Okay, well,
you're going to have to, okay?

First time, it's the hardest.
    After that it's fine.

I told you, okay? Drink this.
                     What is it?

   It something
to make you relax.

Drink it. I promise.
  Close your eyes.

I don't know.
Look and think

that he's like Brad Pitt
     or something.

           (Sighing)

    I'll pretend he's Kevin.

    (Hip-hop music playing)

     Â¶ Girl, what your man
     done for you lately? Â¶

Â¶ Yeah, I know you like the way
    I rap over break beats Â¶

  Â¶ Somebody come beside me Â¶

  Â¶ I'm grinding with a girl Â¶

      Â¶ And she be having
           my baby Â¶

      Â¶ Yeah, did I forget
          to mention Â¶

  Â¶ If you wanted to give her
          attention Â¶

    Â¶ All you had to do-- Â¶

  Â¶ It's got that cut, colour,
      clarity and karat Â¶

      Â¶ Every rich in here
     is trying to inherit Â¶

Â¶ In the pages to the rule book
    I'm gonna tear it out Â¶

          Â¶ Your pussy
   like my favourite jeans Â¶

   Â¶ I'm gonna wear it out Â¶

      Â¶ Big-ass titties Â¶

 Â¶ You all that and then some Â¶

         Â¶ Fat booty Â¶

     Â¶ You got all of that
        and then some Â¶

     Â¶ You got all of that,
    it add up to a big sum Â¶

    Â¶ Let's practice making
   a little girl a big sun Â¶

        Â¶ Ooh, emphasis
      on the "practice" Â¶

   Â¶ I'm like General Custer
 with bedroom battle tactics Â¶

     Â¶ Eating up the pussy,
   no resting for rematches Â¶

         Â¶ Ripping off
 the surgeon general warning Â¶

      Â¶ On the mattress Â¶

       Â¶ I ain't playing
 till your man game over, man Â¶

       Â¶ And you see-see
  done-done this thang again Â¶

       Â¶ It's only right
  that I be fit with a queen Â¶

          Â¶ 'Cause I'm
     the California king Â¶

    Â¶ Wanna Cali-fornicate Â¶

   Â¶ Put your back up, baby Â¶

    Â¶ Drop it to the ground,
  make them squares go crazy Â¶

     Â¶ Girl, what your man
     done for you lately? Â¶

Â¶ Yeah, I know you like the way
    I rap over break beats Â¶

  Â¶ Somebody come beside me Â¶

  Â¶ I'm grinding with a girl Â¶

      Â¶ And she be having
           my baby Â¶

  Â¶ Did I forget to mention Â¶

  Â¶ If you wanted to give her
          attention Â¶

    Â¶ All you had to do-- Â¶

     Â¶ You know, your body
         like a snake Â¶

Â¶ There's venom in your denim Â¶

     Â¶ Don't know how much
          I can take Â¶

     Â¶ Before I'm standing
         at attention Â¶

  Â¶ I see you work it, baby Â¶

    Â¶ The main perk, baby Â¶

     Â¶ You got my grown ass
drooling like the Gerber baby Â¶

     Â¶ Turn around with it,
 show me your La Perla, baby Â¶

    Â¶ To the ground with it,
   drive a nigga stir-crazy Â¶

   Â¶ Apply a little pressure
    and get it right back Â¶

     Â¶ You got your girls,
    and what you tell them Â¶

    Â¶ You'll be right back Â¶

  Â¶ Building up steam, girl Â¶

      Â¶ God as my witness,
what you got in them britches Â¶

      Â¶ Should be labelled
           obscene Â¶

  Â¶ 'Cause I ain't never seen
       half the things Â¶

 Â¶ That you do in them jeans Â¶

    Â¶ Do you bang with it? Â¶

     Â¶ I'm gonna just lay,
     you can rock with it Â¶

  Â¶ I'll take you to the crib,
       do a whop in it Â¶

  Â¶ Go ahead, make them drop,
         I'mma watch Â¶

      Â¶ And it's not that
        I can't dance Â¶

     Â¶ It's what you ought
          to lean to Â¶

     Â¶ That ain't a pistol
         in my pants Â¶

 Â¶ I'm just happy to see you Â¶

               Â¶

               How much money
           did you make tonight?

About 700.

What's wrong?

                        Nothing.

                Just going to...

                here on the lip.

             Babe.

    No, no, no, no, no, no.
        No. No kissing.

      I got all that stuff
      from the club on me.

         Men and smoke.
        I got to shower.

       Besides, I'm sore
    from all that walking...

         and grinding.

                     Yeah, sure.

         Can't we just
     do it in the morning?

           Make sure you wash up
                 real good.

              I don't know where
              that money's been.

      What's that supposed
            to mean?

                        Nothing.

     Look, I'm in control.

    If you want me to quit,
           I'll quit.

        Â¶ Just cruise Â¶

                  Let me ask you
                    a question.

      Humour me with this.

         How is it that
        y'all over here

         just drinking
         my fine liquor

     and just having a big time,

       but ain't one of you
 out on the floor making a dime?

           How is that possible?

            Matt, don't I always
                  tip out?

              Hmm.

Yes, ma'am. Yes, you do.
                            Yes.

That is-- That is a good answer.
     That is a good answer.

        But like y'all,
  I have a J-O-B too, don't I?

         Just like you,
     to stay on top of you

          to make sure
      you're doing yours.

     Oh, you know I always
            tip out.

         I am the club.
         You know that.

        Say it. Say it.
                      All right.

           (Laughing)
               All right, Lexus.

               You are the club.

   But the B-F-L is the eagle
       shits every night.

              Me.

 That means you're tipping out
             to me.

                 Ain't no joking
                   about that.

          That's just how it is.

             EMCEE:
      Tip your waitresses.

      They're working hard
         for you guys.

       What up, Matt E.?

Chicago! My man.
Good to see you.

Roscoe! Roscoe!

        Good to see you.

          (Laughing):
            Chicago.

       How are you, sir?

Listen, I got the VIP room
perfectly set up for you.

     Of course, of course.
All right?

You got your friends with you.
              Yup.

          Hi, ladies.

              ALL:
              Hey.

   There goes my luxury ride.

            ROSCOE:
    I got the VIP all set up
          for you now.

                   Thanks, baby.

           What's up?

           So, uh...

   when are you going to let me
 taste some of that sweet stuff?

Hmm.

Never.

                      (Laughing)
      Oh, it's like that?

             What?

     I got diabetes anyway.

 That's why you only get a 50.
             Here.

         Mmm, Jade Lee,
      my favourite jewel.

What's up, baby?
                             Hi.

Mm-hmm. Say hey.

                    How are you?
Better now.

Mmm. Look at you.
                           Yeah.

That's what I'm talking about.
          You ready?

             Yeah.
          Absolutely.

Yeah.

  Watch yourself
around those guys.

             EMCEE:
    Tasha to the main stage.

               Who's the newbie?

That's Monica.

     She goes by Baby Girl.

            CHICAGO:
 Yeah, she's sexy as hell, too.

               Get her up here.
             I want to meet her.

She don't work the VIP.

  Someone in VIP
wants to meet you.

     He's a movie director.

      Told him you wanted
       to be an actress.

           Seriously?

     Babe, you can show him
       your screenplays.

                  Oh, no. Just--
                     Just you.

              Oh.

          I'll keep him company.

             Okay.

           It's okay.

I know we said no VIP.
   This could be your big break.

               Whatever gets us
             out of here faster.

You sure?

             Nope.

Mwah.

                             Hi.
              Hi.

         (Men laughing)

              Hi.

                    Meet Monica.

             MATT:
  You need anything, boss man?

      Yeah. Uh, tell Lexus

      to bring me a bottle
        of Dom PÃ©rignon.

       You heard the man.

             EMCEE:
Sugar. Sugar to the main stage.

   And after that, Baby Girl.

               Sorry about that.
                  She's crazy.

  Uh, Jade Lee told me that
you're in the movie business?

                      (Laughing)

          You could say I dabble
               a little bit.

I'm an actress.

                         Really?

             How come you're not
                in Hollywood?

I was actually driving
   to Los Angeles,

     until we discovered
that my dad's cancer relapsed.

                          Man...

Trying to make money
  to care for him.

             Sorry to hear that.

            You should let me
         help you out with that.

                  That's $1,000.

Thank you.

Um...

                        Chicago.

 You're Chicago?
You're a director?

                      (Laughing)

       Not unless you're talking

            about a couple
      of horror movies, boo-boo.

Give me a minute.

   Wait, I just gave you $1,000.

             EMCEE:
      Come on, gentlemen.

      Tip your waitresses.

    Chicago is trying to give me
      $1,000 to dance for him.

            Isn't he with Lexus?

No, everybody's dancing
     with Chicago.

Come on, nobody's been offered
   that much money, though.

Take it.
                   Are you sure?

       I mean, I can't be making
              any enemies.

No. Get the money.
   Take it. Go.

             EMCEE:
    Tasha to the main stage.

             So, Monica tells me
               you're a writer.

I am.

              So, where were we?

Uh...

you want that dance?

      So this is your first time
             in VIP, huh?

          Anything goes up here.

                       Even sex.

Well...

you'll have to get Lexus
if that's what you want.

                     Oh, really?

           You think that's what
                  I want?

$1,000 is a lot
   of money

just for a dance.

           I don't want a dance,
                sweetheart.

            I just want to talk.

Talk?

              I think we got off
              on the wrong foot.

       Let me reintroduce myself
                to you.

           Hi, my name is Jorge.

      My friends like to call me
               Chicago.

Monica.

My friends call me Mo.

                       Pleasure.

You've been drinking.

I'm pretty sure you just broke
       rule number one.

                You broke a lot
               of rules tonight.

 I think we need to re-establish
         some guidelines.

So how'd you like your first
night stripping in the VIP?

    I didn't actually strip.
         I just talked.

      Something you and I
 aren't doing a lot of lately.

  That's all
I'm doing now.

Just talking.

You like what you do?

You look like you were eating up
  all the attention up there.

         It's just acting to me.

  So those guys touching
your breasts and your ass,

    that's just
method acting, huh?

    I look like I enjoy it.

      The client is happy.

     They buy more dances,
    and we make more money.

      Tonight that's all
the client wanted, was talking.

                           Yeah.

                     That's all.

So, who's your new BFF?

            Chicago.

     Well, Jorge, actually.

           He wasn't a director,

             but I think he owns
               a record label.

       He gave me $3,000
        to help us out.

  Just for talking?
Sounds like bullshit.

    Bullshit? I'm just trying
to make money for my dad and us.

Don't let the money
    change you.

   How much longer you here for?
   KEVIN: Uh, we're not sure.

    We're waiting to find out
 what happens with Monica's dad,

and then we're going
to head out to L.A.

How about you two?

          Boyfriends?


                             No.

         Ahem, so, um,
       what do you write?

   I picked up some freelance
          copywriting.

   And I'm currently working
         on a feature,

tentatively titled<i> A Man's Guide</i>
    <i> to Understanding Women.</i>

          (Chuckling)

    That sounds intriguing.

I told him it's going to take
     more than one movie

to understand women.

               You need at least
                  two sequels.

Thanks for inviting us over.

   You guys ever roll before?

           Roll what?
           (Laughing)

                     (Chuckling)

 You're so sweet and innocent.

   Uh, never taken X before?

I don't really
do any drugs.

   Um, I mean,
I've heard of it.

It's harmless, actually.

Just takes your sense of touch
   to a whole nother level.

                         Mm-hmm.

             LEXUS:
       Feels like magic.

             You have to try it.
                It's so cool.

                Oh, but I get it
               if you're scared.

        (Both laughing)

I'm not scared.

You want to try it?

                 If you want to.

Okay.

            MONICA:
          Let's do it.

 Okay, Lexus,
truth or dare?

                           Dare.


I dare you...

to kiss Monica on the lips.

              Which set of lips?

The mouth, you nasty whore.
                      (Laughing)


       Â¶ Your hands glide
         down my skin Â¶

       Â¶ You breathe out,
       I breathe you in Â¶

      (Jade Lee laughing)

               See? That wasn't
              all so bad, right?

                 Okay, Jade Lee.

                  Truth or dare?

Dare.

                   I dare you...

                  to give Kevin
                a VIP lap dance.


                       JADE LEE:
                         Okay.

           (Laughing)

        How do you feel?

             LEXUS:
       Don't worry, girl.

       It's just a game.

         Â¶ I work you Â¶

        Â¶ Control you Â¶

          Â¶ I got you
       where I want you Â¶

            Â¶ Now Â¶

   Â¶ Love until the sunrise Â¶

       Â¶ We're going deep
         into the end Â¶

       Â¶ I'm calling out
          your name Â¶

           (No audio)

       Â¶ A shadow's dance
         against her Â¶

      Â¶ You're holding on
        to me so tight Â¶

      Â¶ Don't let me go Â¶

     Â¶ 'Cause here I come Â¶

       Â¶ Mmm, mmm, mmm Â¶

             LEXUS:
       <i> It's just a game.</i>

        (Shower running)

             EMCEE:
       Two for one dances

       on Thursday night.

       Two for one dances
       on Thursday night.

 Come back to Hidden Treasures,

where you get two for one dances
       on Thursday night.

     Hope to see you then.

      Don't forget to tip
        your waitresses.

           Tip them.

        (Both laughing)

So, listen, listen.

When you get off work,

I want you to come over
 to my house tonight.

                You know I don't
                    do that.

      What? Relax.
It's not even like that.

   I'm having a little
get-together at my place,

       and I want
all of my friends there.

Just as a party.

                           Okay.

                           Sure.

          (Chuckling)

             But I get your hat.

It looks nice on you.

                  Handsome cash.

You're just taking
 all of my money.

        (Both laughing)

 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going, baby?

     Just going to the VIP, man.

       No, no, no.
This is for VIP, not BAP.

     That stands
for Broke-Ass People.

You want to go upstairs,
you got to have a bottle.

     Okay, how much is a bottle?

$500.

           Roscoe, I don't have
         500 fucking bucks, man.

I know. That's why it's for VIP,
            not BAP.

       Roscoe, that's my fucking
             fiancÃ©e, okay?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I know. I know.

Hey, easy.

      Kev, you got to go.

  I ain't saying
you got to go home,

but you should go home.

        For what? What do I have
             to go home for?

Causing problems
  in my club.

         I'm not causing
 any problems in your club, man.

Look, I like you,

     and I tell
a lot of people that,

     but I really like you,
and we talked about this before,

    but dancers that bring
their boyfriends into the club,

it just doesn't mix.

It's bad for business.

What's that I always say,
         Trudy?

             TRUDY:
 It's fun visiting Disney Land,

     but it sure ain't fun
         working there.

  Your mouth
to God's ears.

       Now, look, Kevin,

 in all my years
in this business,

I've seen everything.

   Hell, Roscoe and I
we've done half of them.

   But there's one thing,
one thing that never changes.

And that is...

     it's the money
that brings the girls in,

   but it's the attention
that keeps them coming back.

Now your little baby doll,
    your sweet Monica,

she's upstairs right now,

and she's had a taste
    of this life.

And she ain't coming back.

                  That's cute,
               but you're wrong.

            She's not like that.
                   Sorry.

Well, either you're leaving...

or she is.

It's your choice.

             EMCEE:
     Last call for alcohol.

           Last call.

             LEXUS:
      And she didn't even
         have my money.

     Where's Chicago, girl?

           (Laughing)

        Oh, over there.

Looking good, ladies.

            Hi. Good to see you.

Don't hurt nobody.

           (Laughing)

Wow.

               He's been waiting
                    for you.

Yes.

Hey, beautiful.
              Hey.

    Glad you could make it.

Of course.

Your place is fabulous.

                   Ha-ha.
           Thank you, thank you.

       Come on. Come and meet
   some of my friends. Let's go.

           What's up?

Oh, man. I'm good, I'm good.
       Good to see you, brother.

Meet a good friend of mine.

 Monica, meet Wesley Jonathan.

Wesley Jonathan,
 Monica Moore.

               Nice to meet you.

   I own all
of your movies.

                  Oh, thank you.

         Yeah, Chicago says, uh,
         great things about you.

He does?
                         Mm-hmm.

           CHICAGO:
And you know the mayor, right?

Mayor Williamson,
  meet Monica.

    The pleasure's all mine.

                      Thank you.
A friend of mine.

    (Indistinct chattering)

        I am so jealous.

     Give me a little bit.
         A little bit.

           Ooh, yeah.

          And Scipio.

Rap star.

               Nice to meet you.

      And you know Pauly.

A good friend of mine.
   Keith Robinson.

Keith.
          How are you?

I'm good, how are you?
I'm great. Pleasure to meet you.

Pleasure to meet you
      as well.

I love your music.

                   Oh, well,
              thank you so much.

Yeah.
                           Yeah.

       Good to finally meet you.

      Give me one second.

Okay.

          (Whispering)

                    Hey, girl,
                  you look good.

           So do you.
                      (Laughing)

    (Indistinct chattering)

Excuse me one second.

                           Okay.
(Clearing throat)

        (Glass clinking)

   Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

   can I have your attention,
  please, just for one second.

       (Music turns off)

    I have a special request
         from the host,

    the master of ceremony.

 He wanted to do a special song
   for the lady in his life.

   It goes a little something
           like this.

      Â¶ They say that love
        is contagious Â¶

       Â¶ It ain't a thing
 or no one that can save you Â¶

   Â¶ When you've been touched
    it takes over, amazing Â¶

                    Â¶ And 24/7 Â¶

                 Â¶ That person,
                you're craving Â¶

   Â¶ Baby, that's you, yeah Â¶

   Â¶ Baby, all of this love Â¶

   Â¶ I want to give to you Â¶

           Â¶ Monica Â¶

      (Guests applauding)

Wow.

             KEITH:
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

         Salud, salud.
   Y'all party tonight, man.

           All right?
 Let's go, let's go, let's go.

Where the hell
  you been?

It's 6:00 in the fucking
        morning.

               Me and the girls
              got a bite to eat.

            Must have lost track
                  of time.

I was worried.

                    Sorry, babe.

Next time, call.

        Almost made enough money
       to cover Dad's next bill.

Whatever.

Good night.

      (Rock music playing)

      (Cell phone ringing)

            <i> Hello?</i>
         Hey, beautiful.

            Chicago?
  <i> You still got those dreams</i>

 <i> of being a Hollywood actress?</i>
   How'd you get this number?

   <i> Come on. You know I know</i>
    <i> everybody in the city.</i>

     A good friend of mine,
     a big movie producer,

    is throwing a wrap party
      for his latest film.

       He invited me out.
  I want you to come with me.

           Um, where?

             <i> Here?</i>
    No, it's in Los Angeles.

            I can't.
I'm at the hospital with my dad.

You sure? I mean, we could take
  the red-eye out right after.

            I can't.

      I mean, I was going
to compensate you for your time,

    but I'll just check you
    when I get back in town.

           No, wait.

            I'll go.

          Okay, cool.

Meet me at the club
   in two hours.

All right, bye.

      (Phone beeping off)

                    I see how
                you look at her.

              I know something's
                   going on.

            Are you fucking her?

     I'm watching the game.

                  What about me?
                     My music?

                      Answer me.

         (Turns TV off)

Lexus,

you don't ask me questions.

You answer them.

Am I fucking clear?

             Okay.

             Yeah.

Good.


There's my Baby Girl.

       I didn't wake you, did I?

                      (Laughing)

      People wonder why we don't
     have photos of us together.

Where are you going,
    sweetheart?

             Work.

     And you need to rest.

Oh.

I slept enough today.

  You remember that time
I was visiting you at FSU,

and I caught you in that car
       with some boy?

             Randy?

Randy.
        Dad, he's just a friend.

              I've told you that
               a million times.

            I just needed a ride
               across campus.

 I know. I shouldn't take a ride
      if I can walk myself.

            Because if you do...

You'll owe him a favour.

             BOTH:
       And you never want

         to owe anybody

         for something
      you can do yourself.

                      Take this.

        A hundred bucks?

           (Sighing)

           What about
      my field trip money?

 Look, just get something to eat
    for you and your brothers,

                and pay the rent
                up at the motel.

  I'll take care of it tomorrow,
            okay, Auri?

           Okay, Mom.

               Hey, Mr. Roscoe
             will get you a cab.

                     I love you.

      I love you too, Mom.

      (Cell phone ringing)

             Yeah?

   What time are you coming?

   Okay, I'll meet you in the
 parking lot like I did before.

           Okay, bye.

          Mmm-mmm-mmm.

        I think you need
        to slow it down.

What?

        You and Chicago
      are getting closer.

      And maybe that's not
          my business,

   but you have a good thing
          with Kevin.

      It's rare. Special.

You're right.

It's not your business.

    Just don't get sucked up
        in the bullshit.

            MONICA:
Chicago's just trying to help me
     with my acting career.

  He's never asked me for sex.

   I've never even given him
          a lap dance.

         Yeah. So far.

So far? Sugar, I ain't you,
           okay?

   I'm not going to be living
 in a motel with my three kids.

    I got a plan.
I know what I'm doing.

                            Hmm.

              Hey.

         Did you read my script?

           (Sighing)

       I think it's time
 to take a break from writing,

and focus on us making the money
  we need to get out of here.

    Can't do it all myself.

       What, are you kidding?
    What do you think I'm doing?

    I'm busting my ass at Kinkos
          for minimum wage.

             I'm whoring myself,

            begging to sell copy
              for spark plugs.

            And let's not forget
               about the year

          I fucked my life away
         in Tallahassee for you.

I'll get you the rest
  as soon as I can,

that way you can stop holding
 all your little sacrifices

over my head.

     What'd you have to do
    for this kind of money?

I sucked a big,
  black dick.

       Watch your fucking mouth,
                Monica.

                Watch your
          fucking mouth, Monica.

I didn't do anything,
       Kevin.

I called you all night
     last night.

(Clearing throat)

Why didn't you pick up?

           My battery died.
     It's tired, just like I am.

Tired?
              Yeah, tired, okay?

  I'm sick of all your put-downs
        and your neediness.

                    Your jabs.
                 I'm sick of it.

 Your dad's bills
are almost paid up.

When's enough money enough?

                 Our goal is 30.

                   Is that okay?

Is that our goal?

           Our goal?

             LEXUS:
    <i> When was the last time</i>
     <i> you talked to Kevin?</i>

           Not since that night.

   You haven't
fucked him again?

       I'm not trying to move in
            on Monica's man.

          Plus, I didn't think
        you'd want me to anyway.

She wouldn't even notice.

That dirty bitch is too busy
      jocking Chicago.

      I mean,
what did Kevin say?

           He doesn't trust her.

      He said he goes through
   her purse every now and then.

   Besides, you and Chicago have
   that off-and-on relationship.

  She's just a new piece of ass,

          and once he gets tired
             of looking at it,

     he's going to be right back
            to you anyway.

           So, what do you care?

I just do.


                  What about us?

        I mean, you said we were
         going to start a family

                  once the move.

We will.

   Just let me get through
this thing with Chicago, okay?

                      All right.

  (Sultry rock music playing)

       Â¶ I love the way Â¶

     Â¶ You put on a show Â¶

     Â¶ You're so electric Â¶

Do you ever feel anything?

        I feel the beat
         of the music.

 And I think about how many 20s
           I'm owed.

           (Laughing)

              Why?

 The look I see
on Monica's face

when she's giving a guy
     a lap dance.

It's like she likes it.

      She always tell me
when the guys are touching her

and kissing on her breasts,
     grabbing her ass.

It's like she feels nothing.

It's like someone's
touching her elbow.

I just want some truth.

             EMCEE:
    Two for one drinks here,

         Friday nights
      at Hidden Treasures.

      Â¶ Just hold on to me
      if you're drowning Â¶

               Â¶


Now, does that feel like someone
  trying to touch your elbow?

So, what else do you do?

   Besides producing music,
what are your other businesses?

                I work in sales
               and distribution.

     I got to go out of town
for a couple of weeks on Sunday.

 I would like to spend some time
     with you before I leave,

                 if that's okay?

I don't know.

Kevin and I are going through
         some stuff.

        Can I be frank with you?

   If you were my girl, I would
 never share you with strangers.

Kevin wouldn't either,
 if we had a choice.

                        Come on.

              You don't really
           believe that, do you?

   I mean, that's the difference
      between a boy like Kevin

              and a man like me.

      I'll find a way to get you
           out of that club.

   My dad says
be careful of men

who give you something
     for nothing.

            I say what I mean,
          and I mean what I say.

                         Always.

Hey, babe.

Babe, I'm tired.

Babe.

Just get off.

                     I'm trying.

Wait, just back off.

                       (Sighing)

          When was the last time

            you visited your dad
              at the hospital?

    Why are you bringing him
           into this?

I'll give you some
  this weekend.

I promise.

          I love you.

        I love you, too?

           (Sighing)

      (Phone line ringing)

               Â¶

     Â¶ Come spend tomorrow
        with me, yeah Â¶

            Â¶ Yeah Â¶

    Â¶ She was so yesterday Â¶

Fuck.

Â¶ Spend tomorrow with me, yeah Â¶

            Â¶ Yeah Â¶

    Â¶ She was so yesterday Â¶

      (Phone line ringing)

      (Cell phone ringing)

     Â¶ Come spend tomorrow
        with me, yeah Â¶

         So, what did you think?

I liked it.

                You're not lying
                   to me, now.

        You know you can tell me
               the truth.

 You know strippers
never tell the truth.

You ever think about
    that night?

                     What night?

The night we took the X.

          That's crossed my mind
               a few times.

Well, it's crossed my mind
 like nine or ten times.

       Tell me something true
    about you that no one knows.

My name is Julie.

    And one day,
I want to have a kid.

And I'm going to name him
         Arthur,

just like my father

that I love so much.

       Matt said my take
        was to be 50/50

   in the VIP room last week.

      No, hell, no.
No, he wouldn't say that.

Nobody would say that
       to you.

       So now I'm a liar?
   You're calling me a liar?

There's no call
for that, Momma.

She's going to pay me
  what she owes me!

     Listen, you know what?

           First off,
      it's not your money.

  Secondly, he's not your man.
      You are delusional.

       Oh, you calling me crazy?

         I don't know.
If the shoe fits, then wear it.

 So if you can't handle
what's going on in here,

   I'm saying you're the one
     who's leaving, not me.

         You're fired.

   What the hell is going on
            in here?

     Huh? Look here, Pearl,

         I can hear you
    all the way downstairs.

      Roscoe, she's fired!
          Who's fired?

      Momma, you ain't got
        to be like that.

Are you on medication?
        You need to be quiet,

because you ain't no better than
  nobody else, not tipping out.

   I think all y'all bitches
         are stealing.

   Kelly, Pearl, I can't have
   this confusion back here.

       Now, Momma Pearl,
           look here.

You ain't got authority
    to fire nobody.

     Okay? And at least not her.

           She been here so long
              she got tenure.

  Forget it, Roscoe. You know
    what? I'm tired of this.

      You want your little
       thousand dollars?

         You take your
    little thousand dollars.

I'm going to go out there
    and strut my ass,

  and make twice that amount.

            ROSCOE:
        All right, look,
that's enough of this bullshit.

        I want all y'all
    back on the floor. Now!

             WOMAN:
              Oh!

          Oh, oh, oh.

           And you best mind
       your business, Baby Girl.

             EMCEE:
  Up next on the main stage...

                  PEARL:
         I don't like that girl,

     thinking she's better than
   everybody else, try to be me.

Yeah. She's trying to steal
      all our money.

 All up in Chicago's face, man.

             PEARL:
        Mm-hmm. I know.

 I see everything that goes on
          around here.

             LEXUS:
  She's fucking up our chances
    of getting out of here.

You want her out?

                Most definitely.

I'm going to block her.

       What are you going to do?

Don't even worry
  about that.

         Billie came by
      the hospital today.

               Oh, yeah?
      Did you give her the money

     for Daddy's new specialist?

             I did.

  Oh, and, um, Brandy called.

   We had a really nice talk.

                           Yeah?

       She wanted to know

   if those were Jimmy Choo's
         or Louboutins

that you wore to the wrap party
         last weekend.

                           Oh...

                     Uh...how--?

                How did--?
          What did you tell her?

      What did I tell her?

    That's what you're going
           to ask me,

    is what did I tell her?

    When were you going
to tell me you went to L.A.

with one of your johns,

    or were-- Were you ever
       going to tell me?

      Is that that fucking
          Chicago guy?

        Kevin, lower your voice.

No, I'm not going to lower
    my fucking voice.

        Kevin, lower your voice.

                I refuse to have
               this conversation

       in the middle of a diner.

                          Jesus.

   You refuse a lot of things
          these days.

      You already refused

       to read my script,

        and you refused
      to have sex with me.

 Why don't you go and have your
 boyfriend pick you up tonight.

                Kevin, you know
               nothing happened.

          Kevin, stop.
   You know nothing happened.

        I swear to you.

    I did it for the money.

          Â¶ Midnight Â¶

          Â¶ Got a text
      on the cell phone Â¶

   Â¶ There you at the door Â¶

 Â¶ Look through the peephole Â¶

        Â¶ Rain dripping

 Â¶ Unbutton your trench coat Â¶


            Â¶ Shit Â¶

      Â¶ Sweat dripping off

  Â¶ Glass of wine, last time Â¶

        Â¶ Glass of wine,
          last time Â¶

  Â¶ Glass of wine, last time Â¶

        Â¶ Glass of wine,

  Â¶ Glass of wine, last time Â¶

        Â¶ Glass of wine,

Â¶ Glass of wine, glass of wine Â¶

        Â¶ Glass of wine,
        glass of wine Â¶

       Â¶ Welcome to your
      bachelorette party Â¶




        Â¶ Oh no, oh no Â¶

            Â¶ Hey Â¶


    Thank you
for picking me up.

          Yeah, girl. Of course.
                 What's--

                What's going on?

    Kevin found out
Chicago took me to L.A.

and really blowing up
      my phone.

I mean, Kevin was so pissed.

He just left me here.

           Monica, don't do this
                to yourself.

You know, I thought
 I was in control.

I wasn't.

I thought there would be
    no consequences

with all this money.

Sure was right.

                         Well...
Just got sucked in.


I haven't seen my dad
   in over a week.

I barely look him
   in the eye.

Why does it always end
    so fucked up?

              Here's a question.

           You still love Kevin?

I never stopped.

             Well, there you go.
               Got your answer.

Girl, I need to find him.

We got to work this out.

    Well, hello, lovebirds.

            Lexus, it's not what
               it looks like.

             Relax.

    You see, Jade Lee and I
   have an open relationship.

   Just like you and Monica.

            You see,
    you got a certain thing

  that I can't give Jade Lee.

     Although I'm not sure
 what Chicago could give Monica

        that you can't,

    by the looks of things.

                    He doesn't
                  give her that.

    Whores only love money.
Everything else is just an act.

             Lexi.

Hey.

Where have you been?
   I was worried.

      Welcome to my world,
       you fucking whore.

           Excuse me.

             Kevin.

Why are you going
through my things?

What are you doing?

          What the fuck is this?
Those aren't mine.

Those aren't mine!
          What the fuck is this?

                   Stupid bitch.

               All the surprises
                    you got?

    That's not mine either.

Kevin, the only time
  I've ever done X

  was that one time with you.

                         Wait...

             What are you doing?

What does it look like
      I'm doing?

      I can't believe
I was walking around guilty.

            Guilty?

           For what?

              I fucked Jade Lee.

          I fucked the shit
     out of Jade Lee last night.

                    We both
               got jungle fever.

I never cheated on you,
     you asshole.

            At least I can admit
                 what I did.

    If you're going to have sex,

            you might as well
        get something out of it.

               Ain't that right?

You really don't know me at all,
            do you?

             Kevin!

     The woman that I loved
        was a good girl.

      She loved her family
     and she loved herself.

   You're just a cheap trick.

         What the fuck
       is wrong with you?

What the fuck is wrong
      with you?!

                        (Crying)

I'm gone.

          Good. Leave.

    I'll tell you right now,

    Chicago's twice the man
        you'll ever be.

          You're never
      going to do anything

   with those shitty stories.

    (Ring clacking on floor)

  It's probably for the best.

       Acting, stripping.

        You were always
    just an attention whore.

          (Sniffling)

           (Sobbing)

Monica, you're late.

I was starting to think
       you quit.

What's wrong
 with you?

     (Sultry techno music)

      (Jade Lee giggling)

Bitch, what the fuck?

You're planting shit in my purse
      and in Kevin's head?

     What the fuck are you
     talking about, bitch?

        (Both screaming)
     JADE LEE: Get off me!

     (Police siren blaring)

      (Cell phone ringing)

Hello?

       Yeah, we'll accept
          the charges.

          It's Monica.

         Where are you?

           All right.

             (Phone beeping off)
What happened?

     Fucking bitches, man.
     Fighting in the club.

      Going to go get her?

           Hell, no.

        Let her ass sit in there
              for a minute.

   Let me tell you something,
             Black.

   The minute you go running
         after a woman

     is the minute you lose
        all your power.

     Oh, man, I know that.

        Everything I do,
       every move I make

  is situated so I don't have
to jump when people want me to.

          It's about outsmarting

        the man or woman
          next to you.

   Making them think they got
a choice when they really don't.

           Checkmate.

      My feet always hurt
     at the end of the day.

Trudy, is Monica here?

        She went to jail
         for fighting.

She went to jail
 for fighting?

             Yeah.
Goddamn. Thank you, Trudy.

           Good luck!
Thank you, Trudy.

       I can't stand him.
    He always orders water.

            Monica!

           (Laughing)

            Monica!

               Â¶

Thanks for getting me out.

                     No problem.

           I'm sorry.

        So, what are you
          going to do?

          About what?

      Monica, I like you.

          I really do.

          But I can't
      keep sitting around

       while you chasing
some broke fool all around town.

                 I'm laying it
               on the line here.

                  But you got
               to make a choice.

          It's either him or me.

      He's gone. He left.

           Listen...

      I got to go to L.A.
          on business.

          My birthday
       is in three days.

         Come with me.

             Okay.

    Â¶ How did we get here? Â¶

       Â¶ Eyes wide shut Â¶

       Â¶ I got my eyes Â¶

         Â¶ Wide shut Â¶

       Â¶ I got my eyes Â¶

         Â¶ Wide shut Â¶

       Â¶ I got my eyes Â¶

         Â¶ Wide shut Â¶

     Â¶ I'm totally blind Â¶

How about...

a VIP lap dance?

                      I'm ready.

  Â¶ Dreams are made of love Â¶

       (Monitors beeping)

You sacrificed your life,

having a family of your own,

   to be there
for Monica and me.

Years...

you'll never get back.

Thank you.

                       I'm okay.

I'm so afraid.


            No. Don't be afraid.

                Don't be afraid.
               You're not alone.

                 I'm right here.

(Breathing heavily)

I'm so tired.

I'm so goddamn tired.

          You just need to rest.

                      Just rest.

           Just close your eyes.


                  Â¶ This little
                 light of mine Â¶

                    Â¶ I'm gonna
                  let it shine Â¶


                Â¶ Let it shine Â¶

  Â¶ Let it shine, let it shine Â¶

       (Monitor beeping)

             Â¶ Everywhere I go Â¶

                    Â¶ I'm gonna
                  let it shine Â¶

      (Monitor flatlining)

                        (Crying)

         I'm taking you shopping
                tomorrow.

             Okay.

   I need to get a new phone.

  I want you to start looking
    for us a place out here.

    I'm going to be spending
     a lot more time here.

 And I hate staying in hotels.

I need to stay close to my dad
  for a little while longer.

Okay.

   What side of town
do you want to live on?

                Beverly Hills
             or Bel Air is fine.

  And I'm going to start you out
          on an allowance

              of $5,000 a month.

       And we got tickets
     to the opera tonight.

The opera? Oh, you know what?
We should go to a Lakers game.

         I spent $6,000
 on three tickets to the opera.

       Now I got to run out
 and take care of some business,

   but I'll be back at 7:00.
        Please be ready.

You're leaving?

Come on, we just got here.

                     Look at me.

                   You don't ask
                  any questions.

                You answer them.

               Be ready at 7:00.

               Hey. What are you
                  doing here?

Is Lexus here?

                        No. Why?

It's about Monica's dad.

I need to reach her.

                      (Scoffing)

           I-- I can't help you.

                      I'm sorry.
Hey...

this is serious.

         Do you see what she did
               to my face?

Yes. I get it.
  I'm sorry.

Things got so screwed up.

Julie...

did I do something?

               I just thought
           you were here for me.

           (Dialling)

      (Phone line ringing)

             Black?

       Where is Chicago?

    I've been here for hours
        waiting for him.

           Whatever.

           (Sighing)

              MB?

           MB. MB...

          My Bitches.

            Vontela.

             Lexus.

           (Sighing)

            Oh, no.

              No.

         (Snaps closed)
        No, no, no, no.

           (Sighing)

           (Dialling)

      (Phone line ringing)

          Aunt Billie?
          How's Daddy?

       Â¶ She is silent Â¶

   Â¶ Quiet and thinking about
 what she thinks of everyone Â¶

   Â¶ Can see it in her eyes Â¶

     Â¶ Hoping that she will
           confide Â¶

       Baby girl. Monica.

    Â¶ But she shuts her out
          and hides Â¶

       Â¶ And the meadow Â¶

      Â¶ Never leaving... Â¶

       Chicago, I'm done.

        I'm going home.

        I just found out
         my father died

        while I was here
   wasting my time with you.

          I know about
        the other girls.

      I saw your pictures
          and videos.

          Don't worry.

  Now you have one less bitch
     asking you questions.

        I'm out of here.

       I'll be goddamned.

           (Laughing)

               Â¶

       Â¶ I've been asleep
         for so long Â¶

       Â¶ I can't remember
    when I wasn't dreaming Â¶

    Â¶ Must be one of those Â¶

   Â¶ The angels are keeping Â¶

  Â¶ Sometimes I feel so sad Â¶

       Â¶ You really feel
that it's yours for the taking Â¶

     Â¶ Joseph wandered in Â¶

        Â¶ That winter Â¶

     Â¶ When I was waking Â¶

     Â¶ Playing the piano Â¶

     Â¶ In the painted sky Â¶

      Â¶ We were laughing Â¶

          Â¶ Hey said,
   You've been here before Â¶

       Â¶ And so have I Â¶

   Â¶ Those same blue chords Â¶

      Â¶ Playing a melody Â¶

      Â¶ Oh, whoa, Joseph,
with your eyes of many colours Â¶

   Â¶ Sometimes I really feel
      it will come true Â¶

 Â¶ Everyone will take a slice Â¶

  Â¶ Understand the sacrifice Â¶

       Â¶ For what we do Â¶

I think we need to talk.

Oh, and the baby's
   not Kevin's.

           My time is money,
       so if you want my time...

              A manicure is $60.

But the sign says--

             I don't give a damn
             what the sign says.

                             Ow.

                         Monica.

             What?

               Look, I just want
                 to apologize.

     You did what you did.

         And it's over.

How'd you find me?
               I ran into Tasha.

   Look, I just want you to know
           it wasn't me.

  I don't know what you mean.

                    It was Lexus

        who put the condoms
  and the ecstasy in your purse.

              I didn't even know
              anything about it.

       Where is she now?

                 She's in Vegas.

            Chicago promised her
              some lounge act.

                 But we all know
                  how that goes.

                   I just, um...

                 I just thought
                you should know.

   None of it really matters
            anyways.

                 It does matter.

             You loved him once.

            Girl, and I know
        that he still loves you.

         Have you talked to him?

   No, not since that night.

           You know where he is?

       No. And why do you
         want to know?

                  Because I know
                  where he's at.

                         Do you?
You know what? You're done.

                      (Scoffing)

                Same old Monica.

   And what about my other hand?

You're done.

           Jade Lee,
       whose baby is it?

The truth.
                          Truth?

        Don't you know strippers
          never tell the truth?

           Hey, were you telling
                 the truth

         when you told Kevin
    that you never feel anything

             during a lap dance?

   Or how about that his writing
             is shitty?

      Were you telling the truth
           when you told him

   that Chicago is twice the man
              he was?

                   The truth is,

             you still need him.

             And I know he still
                  needs you.

                           Here.

            You should call him.

      Â¶ Those lights are Â¶

 Â¶ Still waiting ahead for me Â¶

      MONICA, OVER PHONE:
          <i> Kevin, hey.</i>

         <i> It's Monica.</i>

    <i> It's been a long time.</i>

    <i> Um, I know you probably</i>
           <i> hate me,</i>

        <i> but I realized</i>

       <i> I never told you</i>
      <i> about your script.</i>

      <i> The one you thought</i>
         <i> I never read.</i>

         <i> Well, I did.</i>

  <i> I've been thinking about it</i>
         <i> a lot lately.</i>

        <i> And about you.</i>

  <i> I guess when you're alone,</i>
<i> you get perspective, you know?</i>

<i> Well, I-- I just wanted to say</i>
   <i> I hope you're doing okay.</i>

  <i> I'm back at the nail salon,</i>
      <i> working part-time.</i>

     <i> I booked a small role</i>
       <i> in an indie film.</i>

  <i> Go figure, they're actually</i>
     <i> shooting decent stuff</i>

        <i> here in Texas.</i>

       <i> I'm still hoping</i>
      <i> to get out to L.A.,</i>

    <i> but I'm just taking it</i>
       <i> a day at a time.</i>

  <i> Well, I guess I'm rambling,</i>

  <i> but no matter what happens,</i>

        <i> I just want you</i>
     <i> to have a good life.</i>

           <i> Be happy.</i>

          <i> I love you.</i>

             <i> Okay.</i>

             <i> Bye.</i>

               (Clearing throat)

                   Mani or pedi?

  I know you got
about three hours.

             Kevin.

         I missed you.

              I...

         But I thought
        you were in L.A.

  I'm finally making a movie.

       You're in Houston?

    Just told the producers,
       "Tax incentives."

      It's an interesting
          topography.

   Raw, undiscovered talent.

          I'm so sorry
       about everything.

     We both made mistakes.

      Do you think we can
     put it back together?

  We never really needed it...
       except each other.

  Someone heard that I, uh...

        sold my script.

          Oh, my God.
      This is your script?

     That is the best news.

           The best.

         That's great.
     I am so happy for you.

             How could I forget?

      Â¶ 'Cause she got me
  in the heat of the moment Â¶

        Â¶ Oh-oh, oh-oh Â¶

Â¶ She got me in the heat of it,
         I can't lie Â¶

   Â¶ I'm just a little bit Â¶

         Â¶ Taken back Â¶

      Â¶ How she caught me
  in the heat of the moment Â¶

   Â¶ Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh Â¶

     Â¶ Yeah, she caught me
in the heat of it, I can't lie Â¶

   Â¶ I'm just a little bit Â¶

      Â¶ Taken back by it Â¶

             Â¶ Oh Â¶

        Â¶ Do-do-do-do-do
         do-do-do-do Â¶

       Â¶ Do-do-do-do-do Â¶

               Â¶

    Â¶ The light that shines
          inside you Â¶

     Â¶ Can be found in any
      box of chocolates Â¶

    Â¶ Or inside of any case
           of wine Â¶

   Â¶ But I can state my case
          for hours Â¶

      Â¶ And pretend I hate
  your flowers one more time Â¶

       Â¶ One more time Â¶

    Â¶ The light that shines
          inside you Â¶

         Â¶ Can be found
   in any box of chocolates Â¶

        Â¶ But the truth
        is that I love Â¶

  Â¶ When we talk on the phone
          for hours Â¶

     Â¶ How come, how come Â¶

  Â¶ I still believe in love? Â¶

    Â¶ After so many years Â¶

    Â¶ After so many tears Â¶

         Â¶ I've shed Â¶

    Â¶ Tick-tock is the clock
          that talks Â¶

    Â¶ When I sing all night,
   'cause it makes me happy Â¶

      Â¶ It makes my hunger
         seem longer Â¶

    Â¶ But it makes my spirit
         get stronger Â¶

    Â¶ So I cry for the world
      that cries for me Â¶

      Â¶ Pray for the world
      that prays for me Â¶

       Â¶ And I don't care
     how you do your hair Â¶

   Â¶ As long as you love me Â¶

   Â¶ Just love me, love me Â¶

          Â¶ Love me Â¶

    Â¶ The light that shines

       Â¶ One more time Â¶

    Â¶ The light that shines
          inside you Â¶

     Â¶ Can be found in any
      box of chocolates Â¶

    Â¶ Or inside of any case

    Â¶ After so many tears Â¶

     Â¶ After so many years,

         Â¶ I've shed Â¶

            Â¶ Shed Â¶

            Â¶ Shed Â¶

               Â¶

   Â¶ I can stare at the sun Â¶

   Â¶ But only for a moment Â¶

      Â¶ It looks just like
         she's going Â¶

   Â¶ What I see in my view Â¶

   Â¶ Is wonderfully created Â¶

   Â¶ Oh, she's such a lady Â¶

 Â¶ All the stars are aligned Â¶

  Â¶ The universal chemistry Â¶

      Â¶ And ain't no place
        I'd rather be Â¶

     Â¶ And ain't no place Â¶

       Â¶ I'd rather be Â¶

Â¶ 'Cause this time is different
