You all right?

Ron.

Are you okay?

How could somebody
do something like this?

Some gruesome stuff.

Yeah.

And just one town away.

Makes you wonder...

What's next?

Yeah.

What is this?

At least tell how it's gonna work.

All you need to know
is the air will burn.

The air will burn?

Trial number four,
absolute perfection.

Yes!

Perfection!

Absolute perfection.

I'm gonna get you!

<i>' No'.!</i>

Ron, do you have to get the kids
all riled up right at bedtime?

No, I don't have to.

I just want to!

Let's go, family prayer.

Cindy, Jason, come on.

Ron.

<i>All right, Ron, your turn.</i>

I think we should have
Cindy say it tonight.

You never say it anymore.

I will another time.

Dear God, thank You
for everything in the world.

Please keep us safe.

Please bless our blessings.

We ask that You
can watch over us,

that we can be a good family.

Did you get what you needed?

What did I tell you
about you and your questions?

With liberty and justice

for all.

Very good, Rachel.

All right, who can tell me what number
President Thomas Jefferson was?

Oh, me.
I know!

Jason?

18?

No, Thomas Jefferson
was number three.

Oh, yeah,
that was my next guess.

All right, children,
show me you know what to do.

Put the crayon down.
Come on.

If it was an emergency,
you'd stay low and crawl.

Hey, Max, this one for real?

Oh, it just went off again.

Stupid thing.

Hey, Dorsie!

Where's Penny?

Out being a teenager!

Come look at this.

What?

I'll get it in the morning.

I ask you to do one thing.

You keep this place running

while I take care
of the important stuff.

One thing!

Cunningham, it's David.

Yeah, I got your check.

Your investments about to pay off.

Get Parker,
be in Cokeville on the 15th.

Here comes the biggie.

Hey, what's up?

I got to figure this out.

I can't sit in there having everybody
tell me they got all the answers,

when every piece of scum just
keeps giving me more questions.

That body in the motel
last week...

Where are the answers
for that guy?

Love you, Dad.

That's just too much of a coincidence
to just be a coincidence,

'cause I love you too.

Love you, Cinderella.

Penny, we're not leaving forever.

Yeah, well, however long it is,
it's gonna seem like forever.

It's gonna be an adventure.

Does it bother you
that I'm going to help him?

No, he's your brother.

Yeah, I know.
You should go help him.

Maybe it could give you some time
to think things through.

Look, Claudia, I-

I'm sorry.

I want us to be a close family.

Well, maybe you could start

by saying family prayers
with us again.

It's all the cop stuff
you see, isn't it?

I just have a hard time
saying those praying things

when the world
I live in is filled with-

Mom!
In a minute, honey!

It's already been
about a million minutes.

We'll talk when I get back.

I hope so.

Love you, Dad.

That's just too much
of a coincidence.

I forgot how pretty it is here.

This'll be where we make our mark.

It smells like somebody
already made their mark.

The dump?

Really?

We pull into town, and the first place
we hit is the dump?

Cut him some slack, Penny.

You know he's brilliant.

He just needs us to support him.

Oh, look, he found us
an empty bottle.

Yeah, he is brilliant.

Don't you think it's kind of weird
that he hasn't told us the deal?

They're here.

David.
Hey, David!

Good to see you.
How you doing?

You got here okay?

Oh, yeah.

We're, uh, just excited
to get going.

Yeah.

Not long till you
see what you bought into.

They gave you money?

Come on, David,
we're like kids at Christmas here.

I'll tell you what] am ready
to let you in on.

I did it.

I've proven mathematically
how I can die and come back to life.

That is just fantastic.

He's been working on that for hours.

Yeah, that's really great, David.

But, anyways,
what's your big idea?

Now, you're going to have
to wait till tomorrow

for the full business plan,
but for today, here's just a taste.

We're good with that.

You ready, Dorsie?
Yep.

You ready to see this, boys?

Uh-huh.
Let's see it.

Ready?

No!

Whoa! Whoa.

The air will burn.

<i>Whoa'.!</i>

Now, just imagine
that times a billion, huh?

So what, are we going
in the firework business?

That's a good way
of looking at it, boys.

Fireworks is gonna take us
into the brave new world.

I told you.

He's one of the smartest guys
I've ever known.

Did you see that?
We're going into the fireworks business.

All the way to the top.

That can thing part of the biggie?

David, I got to tell you,
I am excited.

Big day.

So what's with the painted windows?

I bet he's got to keep it cool
for the fireworks.

Hey, thanks for everything.
Anytime.

When's Dad get home?

This afternoon.

Are you all ready for your test?

Yep, for sure.
Oh, good.

So you know all about Wyoming?

Okay, what is the capital of Wyoming?

. Easy.?

It's W.

Jason.

Got to go, Mom.
Love you.

Love you.

Be safe at school!

Pull over right here.

This...

This is the day we lead people
into the brave new world.

Our enforcer has been outfitted
with five blast caps

placed in cans filled
with gunpowder, aluminum dust, flour,

and it will explode
in the air like confetti.

The gas will explode
on a delayed fuse,

Which will ignite
the particles in the air,

and the air will bum.

Walls will collapse,
and everybody inside

will immediately move as reincarnate

to a world I preside over.

Hold on.

What walls collapse?

Who's inside?

The chosen ones.

The children
of Cokeville Elementary School.

No, really.

What's the plan?

This is a religious community.

They'll do whatever it takes
to get their children back.

No, really.

What's the plan?

This is the plan.

Blowing up little kids is the plan?

It's a good plan.

12-4 to base.

Go for base.

Yeah, Nadene, anything going on?

Well, with you two cops out of town,

I can finally get
some work done around here.

10-4.

Come in!

Come in!

They're going back in.

The biggie's about to happen.

Daddy, what are you gonna do?

You just do as you're told.

You ready?

David, does this have anything to do

with when you
were the town marshal here?

The air will burn.

I'll be back in about an hour.

One more mess-up,
and I'll shoot you.

Hello.

Miss Cook, we're holding
the school hostage.

Don't push any alarms.

Don't call for help.

We have guns, and this is a bomb.

I need just pull this trigger,

and this building,
with everybody inside of it,

will be blown sky high.

Try and hit me over the head
or anything like that,

and I will pull this trigger
when I go down.

Do I make myself clear, Miss Cook?

Stop!

Get over here.

Get over here!

Are you crazy?

I can't believe you would do this
to little kids!

I am not going to do this.

Keys.

Get out of here!

You're no daughter of mine,
no daughter of mine!

It was so tempting

that Goldilocks
set about helping herself.

First she tried a spoonful
from Papa Bear's great, big bowl.

"Ow! " she yelled.
"Too hot!"

Next, she tried a spoonful from
Mama Bear's medium-sized bowl.

"Brr, too cold. "

Finally, Goldilocks tried a spoonful
from Baby Bear's tiny, little-

What exactly are you doing here?

Quiet, lady.

You've got to be joking.

This is my room.

No, this is my room.

Now sit down and shut up.

Follow me.
I have a surprise for you.

What kind of a surprise?

Come and see.

Is it a birthday?
Yeah.

Come to room 4
for a special surprise in room 4.

Come on.

Carson, wait for Mommy!

Sweetie, Mommy will be
right back, okay?

Good. Come right on in.
Thank you.

Hi, Ashton.
Sit down.

Hello, hello, hello.

Thank you.
Come right in.

Come in.

What is this?
Sit down, please.

Hello, thank you.

Welcome.

Go to the back.
Sit down. Be quiet.

Hi, Ben.
Hi, Gracie.

Do you know where
Carson's class is?

Urn...

they might be in room 4.

Okay, let's go to room 4.

How you doing, Pal?

There's your friends.

Come in.

Oh, no, I've got to go.

No. Come in.

You may want to stay.

We have a problem here.

What's going on?

Help me! Help!
Help, please, somebody!

Somebody, I need some help!

Please, please, some-

Please, I need to talk
to a police officer!

This is very important.

There's no officers here right now,
but I can help you.

Please, you need to listen to me!

Something very bad is gonna happen
if we don't talk to the police!

No, listen to me.
I need to talk to the police.

What is wrong with you?

Why won't you get me
a police officer?

Miss, what's the trouble?

Listen to me.

My dad has a bomb,
and he's gonna blow up the school.

If you don't believe me,
come out to my van!

Hey, we didn't know
what he was gonna do!

He's gone crazy!
He used to be real smart.

<i>' Tina?</i>

These are all mine.

Missiles ahoy.

Here I come.

Beep, beep, beep.

What's going on here?

Are you the principal?

Yes, I'm the principal.
What's going on here?

This is what's going on here.

David Young?

Just your old town marshal
here for a friendly visit.

Barn, bam, bam, bam, bam,
ham, barn, barn, barn, barn, barn.

Yes, sir.

What is it you want?

Bam, bam,
barn, ham, bam, barn, barn, bam.

<i>' Shut</i>

I am sick and tired of all this noise!

This is the most important day
of my life,

of our lives!

So shut up and let me focus.

And give me some space!

I want you to go back to your office.

Call the authorities.

Tell them I want $2 million
for each child.

Tell them I'm prepared to stay here
for ten days,

if necessary.

It might take Congress that long
to raise all that money.

And if you're not back in 15 minutes...

I'm gonna start shooting...

Shooting.

One by one.

Anybody runs out, I shoot a kid.

Listen, kids, do as you're told.

Keep quiet.

Everything will be all right.

Max...

it's gonna be
a brave new world.

Max, the brave new world

is basically the idea
of reincarnation.

Hey!

Let the authorities know.

Kids, this is an experience
you'll all tell your children

and your grandchildren all about.

So let's get out
some paper and crayons,

and it'll all be nice in here.

Nadene, there's a mad man
here at the elementary school.

He's got a-
We know.

We've been notified.
How could you know?

Teachers, we need
each of you to count up

how many children you each have
from each of your classrooms.

Yes?

You're not supposed
to say the same word so many times

in a sentence.

"Each. "

You said "each" three times
in the same sentence.

I have 18.

10.

15.

14.
15.

12.

14.

That's 98.

That's right.

Base to 12-4.

Base to 12-4?

Ron, we have a situation
down at the elementary school.

Base to 12-4.

Hey, mister,
I was looking at your guns.

Pretty cool guns,

but why didn't you get an AK-47?

AK-47?

That would be illegal.

How long do you plan
on being here for?

I don't know.
Two days, three, ten?

Excuse me, ma'am.

Um, I left my baby in the car,

and I need to go out and get her.

You left your baby in the car?

I know, I know. I thought
I was gonna be just a second.

Let me tell you something.

You never leave a child like that.

Please, just let me go get her,
and I'll bring her right back in here.

I promise.

You're not going anywhere.

Are you a mother?

Because if you were, you would unders-
Sit down.

Please, just can we just talk and-
Sit down!

Like a brave new world-
Okay, all right.

He told us we were gonna start
a fireworks business.

Nadene, you better start
calling some parents.

Hello?

Hello?

Glenna, the kids are in trouble.

What kind of trouble?

She has no one
to take care of her.

I don't even think
she has a kid in the car.

Excuse me again.
I, uh...

I was just thinking,

maybe you could send
somebody else to go get her?

No.

Okay, well, then could you
just go get her?

Please?

She's my baby.

Thank you.

It's a gold sedan,
and it's parked in the drop-off,

and she's in a car seat.

Hey!
Shh.

I want you to stack
some tables and chairs

and make a barricade
so nobody can go through there.

Why can't we just shut the door?

'Cause the bathrooms right there.

Kids.
Bathroom.

Nadene, I've got to get
a truck over there right now.

You better let the clergy know too.

Hello?

At our school?

Oh, it's all right.

It's okay, it's okay.
Come here.

Get that off.

You come with me?

Big jump. Come on.

Your mommy was bad.

Verlene...

I've read about this kind of thing.

If he starts to sweat,

that's when we're in real trouble.

We can't just sit here.

We've got to do something.

Oh.

Give her to me.

Oh, sweetie.

Are you all right?
Mm-hmm.

You're okay.

I'm sorry I left you.

Mr. Young?

The children are getting sick
from the smell of gas.

Can we take it out of here?

Can we at least open the windows?

Look, this could cause you real trouble

as more and more
of these kids get sick.

At least for now,
they're doing what they're told,

but if they all get sick...

<i>Do it.</i>

But listen, don't you try nothing.

These children are precious.

I'll only shoot them with a .22.

This is a .45.

This is for the teachers.

Your lives don't mean a thing to me.

And your principals
got one minute to get back,

or I start shooting.

The way he's got this bomb triggered,
I don't know what to do.

What do you think he wants?
I don't know what he wants.

I don't know if he knows what he wants.

One minute he's talking
about wanting money.

The next he's ranting about this bomb
creating his brave new world.

What's that?

Ben said it's something
to do with reincarnation.

Got to go.

I'm here! I'm here!

I told them.

Now what?

Now the White House.

Base to 12-4.

Go for 12-4.

Ron, we have a situation
down at the elementary school.

How far out are you?

About two hours.
What kind of situation?

Some lunatic
has taken over the school.

The elementary?

He's demanding a ransom.
That's all we know.

Are my kids in there?

Nadene, the FBI's on the line.

Nadene!
Got to go.

Oh.

He better not touch my kids.

I hope we're not gonna have
any trouble.

Your breath smells like Peaches.

Well, I haven't been eating any.

Peaches is my dog.

Hey, kids, kids,
we're going to play a game.

Kids, hey.

Come on, sweetie.

I'm gonna make a square,
a magic square.

What's a magic square?
What's that?

And no one is allowed
inside this magic square

except Mr. Young...

And Doris.

Back up, guys.
Give me some room.

Back up.
Give me some room.

Can you give me some help?

Okay.

Mr. Robbins,
what happens if somebody

goes inside the magic square?

<i>Then, uh...</i>

They're out of the game.

Okay, let's get a desk
for Mr. Young to sit on.

Oh, yeah, everyone will know.

Have you guys been on TV before?

You will now.

Hey, lady'?

Is this your first time
kidnapping helpless, little children?

Yeah, it's my first.

But David...

<i>Oh...</i>

he has lots of great ideas.

Even better ones than this?

Yeah?

But why are you doing this?

Well, my brother
is really sick in a hospital,

so we're gonna send them money
so they'll keep

taking care of him
so he can get better,

so he can-

Four "so"s.

Do not try to enter the school.

Stay back.

The police will be here shortly.

Stay back.

It will only hurt your children
to push past barricades

and go into the school.

Teacher, are we going to die?

We can't die.
We're just little kids.

I'll be right back, loves.

Mr. Young?

Mr. Young, I have
a proposition for you.

You can keep me.

You can shoot me
to make your point.

I'm fine with that.

But would you please
let the children go?

I'll do whatever it takes
to keep them safe, Mr. Young.

Mr. Young?

The best thing you can do
for these kids, lady,

is sit down and shut up.

How can a genius think around here?

What do you want?

Back off, little man!

Come on, Jason.

Oh, you're all sweaty.

Help me get this off.

The commissioner's here.

Nadene.
Hey.

Now, I understand
this guy wants money.

I'm ready to write him out a check.

How much does he want?

$200 million.

Say again?

$200 million.

For those kids,

I'll sell my entire ranch
if I have to, but...

I don't have-
I know.

I know.

The whole town couldn't.

Hey, Billy, watch this.

Magic foot in the magic square.

Do you think this is funny'?

Do you think this is a game?

Go ahead and try it again.
We'll see who wins the game.

Try it, big man!

Try it

Hey, hey, he doesn't understand.
He's just a little kid.

Shh, keep it down.

Hey.
Shh.

It's all right, sweetheart.

<i>I...</i>

I got to get out of here for a minute.

Oh.

I'm gonna put this on you.

You can only move your hand
about this far.

Okay.

Don't even scratch your nose.

When I come back,
this is all gonna end.

Mrs. Young, do you have children?

A child kind of opens up
your ability to care for others,

don't you think?

Oh, it sure did for me.

Would you want your child subjected
to this kind of terror?

I can tell you're a good person.

This wasn't your idea, was it?

Sometimes you just got to do
what it takes to keep the peace.

This is keeping the peace?

David is a visionary.

He's brilliant.

He figured out with a calculator
how to die and then come alive again.

Amazing.

What a mind.

Okay, then...

so don't get critical.

Forgive me.

I think it's the gasoline.

I...

I've got just such a headache.

Oh, me too. I...

Children, go!

Children, stay low.

Get up!

Stay away from the flames!

Kids, kids, come to me!

Children, go!

Get down! Get down!

Go! Go!

I can get you out.
Kids, come over here!

Stay away from the flames!

<i>' Go, go!</i>

Kids, get away from the building!
Run!

Hey, look, when I get there-
It went off.

The bomb went off!

12-4 to base!

12-4 to base!

Nadene, you got to talk to me!

How could You let this happen?

'Cause You're not even there.

Hurry, hurry, get out.

Are there any children
left in the room?

If there are any kids in the room,
come to me.

Kids, follow my voice.

Oh, come on.

Gather on the far lawn!

On the south lawn!

<i>Jase, you doing okay?</i>

Honey, do you want
anything to eat at all?

Cindy's doing okay,

but he isn't coming out of it.

He just keeps watching
that cop show over and over.

Give him some time.
Ron, he needs help.

I'll see what I can set up.

It's my fault.

No child should be subjected
to that kind of terror.

I should've been there to protect them.

Where was I?

Try it, big man!

Mr. Hartley?

Are you all right?

He's been in there a long time.

Almost two hours.

Should I be worried?

Mr. Hartley?

How's he doing?

Well, that's a good question.

I think you and Jason need to sit down
and have a nice, long talk.

Yeah, you're right.
He's a good doctor.

Why don't you go play for a minute?

I'll grab your mom,
and then we'll talk, okay?

Okay.

Hey.
How did it go?

Oh, it went great.

I guess there's a few things
he hasn't been telling us,

so I think it's time we have a talk.

Ron, don't interrogate him
like he's a suspect.

Jase, the doctor
said that we should talk.

Do you know why he said that?

Don't you want to talk to us?

It's just-

I'm scared.

Don't be scared, honey.

You can tell us anything.

It's about that day
with the mean guy.

Okay.

Well, the thing is,
what I didn't tell you

was that there were other people
in the room with us.

You mean the teachers?

What other people?

The ones all in white.

One was a lady.

She stood by me.

She said that what those people
were doing was very bad

and that the bomb was gonna go off.

She said if I stood by the window,
everything would be okay.

So she helped you?

Did she tell you her name?

But I think it
was Grandma Meister.

Jase, Grandma Meister
lives in Pinedale.

She wasn't at your school that day.

Okay.

That's Grandma Meister.

That's her.

That's the lady you saw?

That's my angel.

I think that's just too much
of a coincidence

to be a coincidence.

Jase, why didn't you
tell us about this before?

'Cause I knew
you wouldn't believe me.

What do you think?

You don't want to know what I think.

Say it.

I'm just not buying his angel story.

I think it's his coping mechanism.

You don't believe our own son?
Y

You know how I think.
I need proof.

So you treat your son
like a criminal?

That's how it works.

I'm trained that way.

Well, then go find your proof.

Maybe Jason wasn't the only one.

You're the sheriff's investigator.

Look into it.

Okay.

I'll pay some visits around town,
see what I can come up with.

Anything at all?

Anything out of the ordinary?

Well, the first thing
I'd tell you is the fact

that the fire alarms went off
for no reason a couple of times

in the days just before the bombing.

Those alarms prepared
the kids in a big way.

They learned to get
out of a room quickly,

to stay low, to crawl
if they needed to find air,

but nobody knows
why the alarms were going off

or why now they've just stopped.

And then I'd look at that business
about the magic square.

If Ben hadn't been prompted
to put that down,

there would've been kids right up
next to the bomb when it went off.

They'd have ended up just like Doris.

But don't you think
that's just coincidences?

Maybe.

But I don't think so.

Then I saw Rich Haskell.
He's the bomb expert.

Hartley, when that bomb went off,

there shouldn't have been
any survivors,

but then there wasn't near as big
an explosion as there should've been.

One big factor was that the meat-head
just happened to choose a milk jug

as the container to put the gas in...

a container that leaked.

Now, the fumes that it gave off
got them to open the windows.

Can we at least open the windows?

<i>Do it.</i>

He let them keep the doors open.

'Cause the bathrooms right there.

Those openings created
a vent for the blast.

Also, the leaking gas
ran down into a can

that he had filled
with aluminum particles and flour.

They were designed
to shoot into the air on fire,

creating an even bigger explosion.

It would've been
like the air was on fire.

Now.

But with it wet,
it couldn't happen.

See, those things I understand,

but there were just too many things
that I cannot explain,

like only two of the five
blasting caps went off.

The wires that were set to trigger
the other blasting caps were cut.

They weren't pulled out,
they weren't ripped,

but cleanly cut,
like snipped with wire cutters.

If those wires
had been connected,

it would've kill-

it would've killed everyone
in the room.

And then...

The cartridges that
he had rigged inside the bomb

started exploding.

Now, you tell me.

How did the walls get all pocked up
and damaged

Without shrapnel
going through people?

It doesn't make sense.

It doesn't make sense.

He wasn't that stupid.

He wasn't that stupid.

I don't think he would have picked
a milk jug that leaked.

I think whoever
or whatever cut those wires

made the milk jug leak.

Well, we can think a lot of things,

but here's a fact.

In his journal, the guy bragged
about how many times

he assembled the bomb, tested it,

and every time it worked
exactly the way he planned,

except this time.

What do you make of that?

Unexplainable things
happen all the time.

I don't know. Maybe the guy
just messed up this time.

And cut his own wires?

Well, that's just the bomb side of it.

Then there's the other side of it...

The walkers.

Katie, can you tell
Mr. Hartley what you told me?

Katie, he wants to hear from you.

Well, I was coloring,

and then when I looked up,
there was this lady standing there.

She was all in white.

She told me that she loved me

and that my brother
would come and get me

and everything would be okay.

And then I looked down for a second...

And when I looked back up,
she was gone.

Then my brother came
and took me over by the window.

when the bomb went off,
she was right there to get out.

And her sister claims
that she saw something too.

I was coloring,
and when I looked up,

I saw angels all around where
the tape on the floor was.

The angel people,

they stayed between us and the bad guy.

One was a lady, and she stood by me.

Rachel, what did the lady look like?

It was like a white dress.

What kind of hair?

Like yours but more curly.

But my same color?

Excuse me a minute.

Look at this.

That's her.

That's my angel.

Except without the glasses.

That's my mother, Mr. Hartley.

She died when I was 15.

Oh, she must've come back
to watch over them.

And there were others.

The Sorensen girl said a woman
helped her out of the room.

We got to get out of here!
Come on!

Go, kids, go!

Then when I got out the door,
the lady was gone.

Jennie later identified
the woman as her aunt

who died ten years ago.

So again it was an ancestor?

Yeah.

What's that about?

Who else?

Who else would care more
about us than our own family?

Can't you see?

You can't see
what's going on here?

I don't know what I see.

You are such a cop.

Every adult and every child
made it out of that explosion alive,

and you haven't the humility
to thank God for blessing us.

Hey, bud.

Come here a minute.

You Okay?

Did we wake you?

Good.

There's something else
I want to talk to you about.

Jase, was there anything else

that maybe you didn't tell us?

Anything at all?

It would really help your dad
if you could think of something.

Yeah, I know something else.

Light-bulbs.

Right before the bomb went off,

lots of angels came down
through the ceiling.

They looked like light-bulbs.

Light-bulbs.

You mean like this?

Uh-uh.

Like that.

There was an angel
for everybody.

They were holding hands
in a circle around the bomb.

Then when the bomb happened,
they went fast up into the ceiling.

This guy had police training.

He knew what he was doing
with that bomb,

but it didn't work
like it was designed.

It should've gone out,
but instead it went straight up

through the ceiling.

Why don't you go on upstairs,
okay, honey?

I'll be there in a minute.

There is no way
Jason could've known that.

There's something else that I learned
that happened that day.

Do you think this is funny?

Do you think this is a game?

Go ahead and try it again.
We'll see who wins this game.

You want to talk miracles?

I'll tell you a miracle.

Try it, big man!

Try in

That me and every other officer

just happened to be
out of town that day,

because I know
that if I would've been there,

I would've stormed into that room
with so much hatred for that man...

I probably would've gotten myself
and everyone else killed.

But without me
and the other cops,

there was a chance
for it to go another way.

Hey, he doesn't understand.
He's just a little kid.

<i>Hey -</i>

Let's say a prayer.
Pass it on.

Let's say a prayer.
Pass it on.

Let's say a prayer.
Let's say a prayer.

Allyson, you say it.

Why me?

Because you're
the smartest in the class.

Dear God,

We need Your help today,
especially if the bomb goes off.

Most every child prayed
sometime during the crisis...

<i>Not because
somebody told them to...</i>

But because they wanted to.

And they weren't the only ones.

Please, God, please.

They won't allow us to be
on the elementary school grounds,

but we can do something right here.

I may get fired for doing this,

but if anyone wants to,

please join me in prayer.

The entire high school got together

and knelt in prayer.

Praying for their
little brothers and sisters,

their moms and their dads.

Prayers for their safety were going on,

not just throughout the town...

12-4 to base!

Nadene, you got to talk to me!

But as the news spread,
throughout the whole country.

The man and his wife have herded
the entire student body

into one classroom.

They are demanding a ransom,

and we understand that that ransom
is $2 million for each child held.

The nearest hospital
is in Montpelier, Idaho,

which is about 30 miles away.

That hospital and others are gearing up

for what could be a disaster
of epic proportions.

Maybe even the world.

Dear God...

Even then you couldn't bring
yourself to pray?

It'd never worked before.

Why should it then?

Hey.
It's all right, sweetheart.

We pray that we will all be safe

and that everyone will live.

We pray in Jesus's name.
Amen.

Amen.

I got to get out of here for a minute.

But if you ask me,

the most amazing thing...

Is that even though these kids
and these teachers

were terrorized for two hours
by a raving lunatic...

<i>So many of them turned
and went back into that room to...</i>

make sure that everybody was out.

They went into a room
that was on fire

that they could barely breathe in,

with a madman and his guns

and cartridges
exploding everywhere,

trying to help others.

You're gonna be okay.
Come on.

Is there anyone still in here?

Me.

Cindy.
Oh.

Out the window.
Go, go.

Ben?

And one of them that was saved
at the end was our Cindy.

I got her.
I got her.

Take her!
I got her.

<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

Oh, my babies.

Oh, my goodness.

Where's Daddy?

Ron, it's all right in front of you.

I see it.

But I don't-

Hop out, bud.

I'm staying with Dad.

Well, I'm not staying.
I'm going in.

We'll meet you right here
after class, okay?

Be good.
Bye, bud.

Hi. Hey.

Hi.

What?

I shouldn't be here.

I thought I could do this for Jase,
but I can't.

I've got so much hatred
for those people,

and I know they're dead,
and I'm glad they're dead.

Ron, I love you.

You're the greatest man I know,

but I will not raise our children
seeing you like this.

You had better figure out
what's real in this world

and what's not,

or you could lose us.

Hey, come on, you guys.
Let's go to class.

It's only natural that our faith
is tested when bad things happen,

to ask ourselves, if God is in control,

then why didn't He stop this?

Why did He let those people
enter the school?

Why did He let any
of our innocent ones get hurt?

And not just the children
and those in room 4.

We've all been wounded

because those
we love the most have been hurt.

And because we're human,
it's only natural

that we have feelings of hatred
towards those that did this,

but hatred toward them
is a dead-end journey.

Hatred towards them
is like drinking a poison

and hoping it will kill your enemies.

It doesn't work.

What will work, what will save us
from a lifetime of hatred and loathing

is the same thing that saved
our children in that room...

Prayer.

We've all witnessed the miracle
of how prayer can save lives.

Now let's let it heal our hearts.

<i># Pray He is there #</i>

<i># Speak #</i>

<i># He is listening #</i>

<i># You are His child #</i>

<i># His love #</i>

<i># Now surrounds you #</i>

<i># He hears your prayers #</i>

<i># He loves the children #</i>

<i># Of such is the kingdom #</i>

<i># The kingdom of Heaven #</i>

<i># Heavenly Father #</i>

<i># Are You really there? #</i>

<i># And do You hear and answer
every child's prayer? #</i>

<i># Some say that Heaven is far away u#</i>

<i># But I feel it close around me
as I pray #</i>

<i># Heavenly Father, I remember now #</i>

Dear God, please forgive me.

<i># Something that Jesus
told his disciples long ago #</i>

<i># Suffer the children to come 10 me #</i>

<i># Father, in prayer
I'm coming now to Thee #</i>

<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

Can you forgive me?

Let's go find your mom, okay?

Come on.

<i># Father, in prayer
I'm coming now to Thee #</i>

We knew that a miracle
had happened,

and there was a spirit
about the town.

We loved each other.

It was a gift, and we knew it.

We know that there are people

on the other side who care.

We know we're not alone.

We know.

I know I'm here for a reason,

and it's my children and my husband.

And I was saved that day

to be a mother to them

and to teach them

that not everyone
in this world is good,

but that we can forgive

and that we can move on.

Doris Young told us that...

Kids, this is an experience
you'll all tell your children

and your grandchildren all about.

And she was right.

I will tell my children
and my grandchildren

over and over

of the miracles of that day

and that prayers are answered.

I know that He protected us that day.

He sent His angels to protect us,

and I'm not ashamed
to be a voice of that.

Before I go to bed at night,

I check on my four children.

They are miracles to me.

They wouldn't be here if I wasn't here.
