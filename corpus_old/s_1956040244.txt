Where's miss, uh,               
single black female tonight?    

           Oh, who? My roommate?

Hey. She's always here.         

       <i> She's out of town</i>       
       <i> for the weekend.</i>        

Why didn't you say so?          

                     I just did.

                          Mm.   

         Okay, you come with me.

          - Ha ha ha.           
          - All right.          

          ( laughing )          

                      You first.

                      Like that?

Mm, like that.                  

Oh. Oh, wait, wait, wait.       
Wait, baby, hold on.            

     - What's wrong, baby?      
     - Hold on a second.        

Um, you know                    
what's wrong, babe.             

                I'll be careful.

Uhh. Wai--                      

Baby, I'm serious, okay?        

                      All right.

           Store down the street
           still open?          

                  Go down there,
                  grab a pack.  

A pack?                         
You only need one.              

           We'll see.           

     Hurry back                 
     before I fall asleep.      

        Don't you move.         
      I'll be right back.       

    ( turns on television )     

           <i> This room</i>

            Dwayne.             

       Baby, is that you?       

  Woman:<i> Dwayne, stop playing.</i>  

   I know you're just trying    
          to scare me.          

              Aah!              

         ( screaming )          

       Somebody help me.        

              Aah!              

       <i> ( knife stabbing )</i>

          Man:<i> Monica.</i>          

            <i> Monica.</i>            

   Hey, sorry to keep you awake.
   Guess what.                  

     <i> I just closed a deal</i>      
   <i> on our next two seasons.</i>    

       - What?                  
       - All we need now        

      is your Jane Hancock      
      on the dotted line,       

and we are 26 episodes closer   
to syndication. Cha-ching.      

   Wait. Greg, what? I thought  
   we already talked about this.

             I'm not coming back
             to the show.       

      I've worked too hard      
          on my craft           

        <i> to be stuck on</i>         
      <i> a mediocre sitcom.</i>       

     I just want to do more     
  with my talent, that's all.   

  Oh, come on, Monica. I mean,  
it's just a couple more seasons.

     Did you know<i> Baby Gurl</i>     

   <i> was ranked the number-one</i>   
   <i> urban show on television?</i>   

   Why are you pressuring me    
           like this?           

 You're supposed to be looking  
   out for my best interests,   

       not the network's.       

                     Okay, okay.
                     Okay, babe.

  I think it's time I was honest
  about this contract thing.    

       The truth is, the network
       never expected<i> Baby Gurl</i> 

 <i> to finish with high ratings.</i>  

       And quite frankly,       
 they offered me a lot of money 

     to secure your return.     

 Well, they can keep the money. 

  Well, it's a little too late  
           for that.            

  How do you think I paid for   
     my new digs in Malibu?     

Well, Greg, you need to sell it 
  because I'm not coming back.  

            Oh, come on, Monica.
            I tell you what.    

            Why don't we discuss
            this over... dinner?

        How about Crustacean?   
        You like seafood, right?

Mm-hmm, but I can't.            

I'm going camping this weekend  
with my friends.                

But look, when I get back       
from out of town,               

I'll give you a call and we can 
straighten out this whole mess  

          that you've           
  gotten yourself into, okay?   

                     Okay, okay.

Have a good weekend.            

        Yeah, you too.          
        Get out of here.        

         Emma, can you          
     come in here, please?      

          Yeah, Greg.           

I'm going camping               
this weekend.                   

                  Really? Where?

       I don't know yet.

       $8 DVDs. DVDs, $8.       
     Come on, people, DVDs.     

    All right, make it five.    
          Maybe five.           

             Oh, good brothers,

                  <i> Barbershop V.</i>

       - How much is it?        
       - $8.                    

 Hold up, man.                  
 That shit ain't came out yet.  

I give you five for it.         

         $5? Come on, I'm trying

Give him five.

                Troy, baby.     
                What's up, dawg?

                         Hey, D.

     - Oh, man.                 
     -<i> How you doing, man?</i>      

When did you get out?           

                      Yesterday.

Ah. For real?                   

    - Yeah.                     
    - Slinging DVDs already?    

              I got to get paid.

Not slinging DVDs, you ain't,   
baby. Get with the program.     

     Nah. They done scared      
       a nigga straight.        

       Word? Hey, cool.         
       Stay broke, then.        

        <i> That's why you</i>         
      <i> dressed like that.</i>       

  - Dang. Where you get this?   
  -<i> Oh, you dig that?</i>           

Beverly Hills, man.             
You know how I roll.            

Little something                
I scooped up.                   

  The whip or the white girl?   

  Man, you still a fool, man.   
  Get in the car. Let's roll.   

        I got somewhere         
       I wanna take you.

         Troy. My boy.          

       - How's it going?        
       - Good.                  

            - Tania.            
            - Tania.            

    Man, you ain't still        
    fucking them dudes, are you?

Ooh, oh, this is nice.          

           All right.           

Okay, girl, remind me           
why I'm going camping again?    

   Because you're my best friend
   and you want me to be happy. 

Yeah, right. Okay,              
so hanging out in the woods     

just pop in your head           
or something?                   

   Okay, it'll be different,    
   but it'll be fun, you'll see.

Yeah, different.                
That's what I'm afraid of.      

 <i> Girl, look, just some things</i>  
 <i> black folks don't do, Monica.</i> 

I think hanging out in the woods
is very high on the list.       

 No, Freida. Some black folks do
 enjoy hanging out in the woods.

    It's niggas that don't,     
  and at some point, sweetie,   

       you have to decide       
       which one you are.       

       Oh, wait. No, no, no, no.
       Calm down.               

 - I don't know how you do it.  
 - How I do what?               

I mean how do you date          

a fine-ass honey like that      
for two years and not hit it?   

                Ain't easy, bro.

   But after all that stuff     
   that happened with her sister

       and everything,          
       you know what I'm saying?

Yeah, well, you're              
a better man than me,           

but who knows? Maybe all        
that'll change this weekend.    

I'm gonna break it in.          

             I'm counting on it.
             I'm counting on it.

          Woman:<i> Whoo.</i>          

       ( starts engine )        

          All right.            
          So we want to do that.

        Want to have a good time
        while you're doing it.  

        Smile and work the john.
        Work it.                

           But the first rule is

your pimp always come first,    
you got that?                   

    Excuse you, motherfucka.    

    Frosty, look what he did    
         to your shirt.

Good looking out on the hook-up.

               Yo, ain't nothing
               but a word.      

                     ( mutters )

             Yeah.              

        <i> Wait. Shut up.</i>         

           Is it me,            
   or has that car behind us    

       been following us        
       for the past hour?       

           Say what?            
     Switch lanes, Dwayne.      

     Let's see if this fool     
     following us.              

              What it look like?

See, he switched lanes, too.    
He's stalking us.

      Please. You are not       
      that big of a star.       

Wait. Mr. Stalker,              
we're over here!

    ( indistinct utterance )    

         Wait, Dwayne.          
     I think that was Troy.     

                          So?   

So? Aren't you gonna stop?      
That is your cousin.            

Dwayne, stop the car.           

Hope you know what you're doing,
Monica. Troy's bad news.        

    Stacy:<i> And you're giving</i>    
      <i> this person a ride?</i>

Cuz, am I glad                  
to see you, man.                

     What's up, Troy?           
     You remember Monica, right?

Of course.                      
What cracking, Baby Gurl?       

   Hi, Troy.                    
   You need a ride somewhere?   

Hell, yeah.                     

                 Uh, one second.

Hold up. Wait.                  

      What are you doing?       

  How you gonna offer him a ride
  without asking me first?      

    I shouldn't have to ask.    
    He's your cousin.           

      We have to help him.      

    We don't have to do nothing.
    Troy's a grown-ass man.     

      Look, you're the one      
      that's always saying      

      you wish your family      
      was closer, right?        

       I mean, at least         
       you've<i> got</i> family.       

Yo, D, man, she is right, dawg. 
   I mean, he is your cousin.   

                All right, fine.

Make a decision. Come on, man.  
My feet are killing me.         

          Where you going, Troy?

Going to Big Mama's house       
up in Oakland.                  

          All right, we're going
          to Yosemite.          

I can take you as far as Fresno.
After that, you're on your own. 

  All right, cool.              

            - Troy.             
            - Huh?              

  We don't have to remind you   
  to be on your best behavior?  

You won't even know I'm here.   

                It's a bad idea.

      Man, it sounds like       

    they're getting restless    
       back there, babe.        

         Did you bring          
    any of those comic DVDs?    

         Nah, I didn't.         

    But we could always watch

 - No.

This is how you live            
when your girl's got            
a number one hit show.          

       Johnny: Hey, all,        
        check this out.         

Oh, whoa. No, no, no, no.       
Yo, come on, man. Please, dawg. 

Come on, man, the owner's       
a huge art freak, all right?    

He's very sensitive             
about his shit.                 

          So let's not fuck with
          his shit, please.     

       - All right, dawg.       
         - Sorry, man.          

What'd y'all do with--          
Was there something in this?    

                     Where what?

         ( gibberish )          

     Man, damn, Troy.           
     That shit ain't even funny.

       Didn't I say             
       don't fuck with his shit?

 Could you be any more stupid?  

   Just a dumb mask. Wasn't like
   I was gonna kill somebody.   

           Hey, babe.           

     ( indistinct chatter )     

     -<i> Okay. </i>                   
     - Keep an eye on him.      

     ( indistinct chatter )     

        Well, I'll be a monkey's
        second cousin. Dwayne.  

You got to be kidding me, right?

            <i> Monica.</i>            

I don't believe this shit.      

        So, we're driving along,
        minding your business,  

     when all of a sudden, boom,

        my tire blows           
        like a hooker on Sunset.

         Ha ha ha. I try to call
         the local tow company  

        with my cell phone, but 
        I couldn't get a signal.

Mm. You honestly expect me      
to believe that?                

      It's the truth, Baby Gurl.
      Isn't that right, Daffy?  

   Hmm? Actually, it's Dapny.   

    What was my line again?     

Greg, let me talk to you        
for a second.                   

Okay, cut the crap.             

   I'm dead serious, Monica.    
   This was totally unrehearsed.

    I got a flat tire, and      
    the heavens were kind enough

       to place me              
       in the reassuring company
       of friends.              

And you didn't follow me up here
to get me to sign the contract? 

        It's funny, I never even
        thought of that.        

( sighs )                       

All right, you can              
stay here tonight,              

but you have to be gone         
by morning, okay?               

                  Scout's honor.

So it looks like you two        
worked everything out.          

          Yeah. He's gonna leave
          in the morning.       

Okay.                           

All right, Gregory,             
so you and your friend,         

you guys can sleep in the spare 
 bedroom down in the basement.  

    Troy, you got the couch.    

   Come on. I'm your cousin.    
How you gonna give me the couch?

 <i> You can sleep outside, then.</i>  

    Right. Oh, and don't get    
        too comfortable.        

         You're leaving         
      in the morning, too.      

         And for the rest of us,
         this weekend's gonna be
         off the chain.         

             Yeah.              

       And we got hiking,       

                 we got camping,
                 rock climbing, 

                    and fishing.

       So if I were you, I'd get
       a good night's sleep,    

 <i> 'cause after tonight, we're</i>   
 <i> gonna be sleeping out there.</i>  

      ( thunder rumbles )       

         But, Dwayne,           
         it's raining out there.

     Don't worry about it.      
 Storm's gonna pass by morning. 

  All right, let's wrap it up.  
   See y'all in the morning.    

     - Turn in, baby?           
     - Yeah, sure. Why not?     

               I think I'm gonna
               turn in as well. 

   -<i> Freida, you coming up? </i>    
   -<i> Yeah.</i>                      

            Hey, hey, thickness,

       you need somebody        
       to keep you warm tonight?

It's warm enough                
from your hot-ass breath.       

      Look, if you don't scream,
      I won't holla.            

Yes, you will once I kick you   
in the balls.                   

Why don't you leave me alone?   

       What do you think?       

     Mm, I like. I like it.     

                 Come here, you.

Mm. Thank you for putting       
this whole thing together, baby.

I know it's gonna be            
a great weekend.                

I love you so much.             

                I love you, too.

      <i> Why did you make me</i>      
         <i>   come up here?</i>       

    - What do you mean--        
    - You know I don't like     
      your friends, Malik.      

   - Stacy--                    
   - And they don't like me.    

Now you just overreacting,      
all right?                      

        Who's my bitch?         
        Who's my bitch?         

                           I am.

       ( woman screams )        

What the hell was that?         

 Monica?                        

        Johnny, wake up.        
    I think Monica screamed.    

             <i> What?</i>             

        ( both chuckle )        

               Look.            

         No, he didn't.         

            Aah,                
            I'm getting married.

Congrats, Baby Gurl.            

          Oh, my God.           

     ( indistinct chatter )     

Oh, my God, Monica,             
it's beautiful.                 

     ( indistinct chatter )     

Way to go, playa.               

   Aw, that's a nice rock, D.   

  - You know how I do, buddy.   
  - You know what, man?         

I say this calls for a toast. 
  What y'all think?             
Yeah.                         

     T, there's a couple bottles
     of bubbly in the kitchen.  
     Go handle that.            

I'm on it.                      

  Yo, Johnny, man,              
  find some music on the tube.  

 - Get some sounds up in here.  
 - That's a great idea.         

Let's get this party started. 
Yeah, party!                  

                            Uch.

          Man on radio:         
  <i> A brutal and bizarre murder</i>  
  <i> in the Los Angeles area...</i>   

                  Wait a minute.
                  What's this?  

      <i> ...reeling tonight.</i>      

     <i> At this hour, police</i>      
  <i> are scouring neighborhoods</i>   

     <i> looking for this man,</i>     

          <i> 35-year-old</i>          
     <i> Kondray Deon Booker,</i>      

      <i> also known as K.D.</i>       

      <i> He's wanted in the</i>       
<i>gruesome murder of Tanya Walsh.</i> 

     <i> Her dissected corpse</i>      
<i> was found earlier this evening</i> 

    <i> in Fremont, California.</i>    

  <i> Also, police have released</i>   
     <i> this composite sketch</i>     

    <i> of a man they believe,</i>     
 <i> based on eyewitness accounts,</i> 

  <i> may be Booker's accomplice.</i>  

     <i> If you may have seen</i>      
     <i> either of these men,</i>      

       <i> you are urged to</i>        
  <i> contact police immediately.</i>  

  <i> Again, if you have any idea</i>  
     <i> of their whereabouts,</i>     

<i>call your local law-enforcement</i> 
      <i> agency right away.</i>       

      <i> Up next in sports,</i>       

    <i> a familiar face will be</i>    
     <i> walking the sideline</i>      

 <i> at Staples Center next year.</i>  

      Well, if ain't nobody else
      gonna say nothing, I will.

   What's up with your cousin?  
   Is that fool psycho, or what?

  <i> 'Cause I ain't in the mood</i>   
           <i> for this.</i>           

     Yo, Troy's a lot of things,
     but he ain't no killer.    

            You saw the drawing.
            It was Troy.        

          Maybe it was somebody 
          that looked like Troy.

                 They don't even
                 give a name.   

   Didn't he get out of jail    
         for something?         

       I don't know, man.       

         Look, if it's gonna    
         make y'all feel better,

      I'll go talk to him       
      and clear this all up now.

                        Yo, cuz.

Damn, cuz. Don't be             
coming up on me like that.      

Almost made me drop the bubbly. 

          Relax, man.           
     I need to talk to you.     

           What's up?           

       Is there anything        
      you want to tell me?      

     <i> It's all right, man.</i>      

  I got my salad tossed once,   
 but I swear I didn't like it.  

   Troy, I'm talking are you    
   in some type of trouble?     

Oh, no, not me, cuz.            
I'm a law-abiding citizen now.  

             So you don't know  
             anybody named K.D.?

              Who?              

              K.D.              

  Nah, it doesn't ring a bell.  

  Cool. They're just paranoid,  
        then. Coming up?        

     Yeah. Just let me grab     
         some glasses.          

            See you in a minute.

             Fuck.              

                         Yo, yo.

 Hey.                           

So, what'd he say?              

   - I got to pee.              
   -<i> Bathroom's right there.</i>    

He didn't do it,                
just like I said.               

You don't believe him, do you?
-<i> Actually, I do.</i>               

             Yeah, likely story,
             Dwayne.            

  - So where's Mr. Clean now?   
  - He's right behind me.       

Now can we please get back      
to the celebration?             

 I hear that.                   

        Damn! That fool         
        done cut the lights out.

    ( overlapping chatter )     

I'm getting me some out of here.

        Malik: Oh, shit.        

     Hey, what's going on?      

       ( flushes toilet )       

     Where'd everybody go?      

         - ( bang )             
         - ( screams )          

 Greg, if you're trying to get  
laid, this is not how to do it. 

     Cut it out, you guys.      
       This isn't funny.        

           You guys?            

 Uhh. Why do I always do that?  

              Aah!              

         ( screaming )          

    - Did you hear that?        
    - I didn't hear nothing.    

    - It sounded like Dapny.    
    - Dapny who?                

      We can't just             
      leave her like that.      

   That girl could be in        
   serious trouble up there.    

We have to help her.          
Look, forget that "we" stuff. 

Nobody told her                 
to stay behind.                 

Besides, it's Greg's girlfriend,
so let him go get her.          

           I never said that.   
           I never said that.   

           Wait a minute, y'all.
           Monica's right.      

             We need to find out
             if she's okay.     

Are you out of your mind?       

   Fine. If y'all are willing   
       to have her death        
       on your conscious,       

     then go ahead, leave,      

  but I'm going back up there.  
   Who's gonna come with me?    

          I don't see her, dawg.

 - Dapny?                       
 - What are you screaming for?  

  Maybe she fell or something.  

Why didn't you yell out, "Troy, 
over here. Come kill us, too"?  

    Look, I say we leave now    
    while we're breathing.      

      ( women screaming )       

           Oh, damn.            

           ( yells )            

 Stacy:<i> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i> 

       Get to the phone.        
       Get to the phone.        

        Get to the car.         

         Freida: Shit.          

          To the car.           

          Wait for me!          

     Greg: Push over, guys.     

            What does he mean by
            "who's next"?       

Who cares?                      
Fire this up, Dwayne.           

    - ( engine turns over )     
    - Dwayne:<i> Come on.</i>          

    Freida:<i> Hold up, Dwayne.</i>    
     <i> Why aren't we moving?</i>     

 I don't know.                  
 It won't turn over.            

Maybe somebody should get out   
and look under the hood.        

   Yeah, what about you, Johnny?
   Man, you know about cars.    

Yeah, I sell cars. I don't know 
shit about fixing them.         

It wouldn't matter anyways.     

    You aren't even wearing     
    any fucking shoes.          

        I know.                 
        My feet are killing me. 

Oh, baby.                       

       Oh, Jesus Christ.        
       Pop the hood. I'll do it.

I can't see anything.           
I hope he's okay.               

             Caprice,           
             I'm sure he's fine.

       It's not like there's any
       wild animals out there.  

  No, no, wild animals,         
  just Dwayne's psycho cousin.  

What's he doing out there?      

  What you trying to do, give us
  a heart attack or something?  

    Sorry about that.           
    It's dark as hell out there.

Look, are we ready              
to roll, or what?               

               I don't think so.

 The alternator cables have been
 cut on both the cars.          

            - What?             
            - Damn.             

         Someone doesn't want us
         to leave.              

        Caprice:<i> Oh, no,</i>        
     <i> what are we gonna do?</i>     

Shit, Monica, I left my two-way 
in the house. You got yours?    

                   No. I left it
                   in the room. 

        Great. Now what?        

 - Oh, wait, wait. I found it.  
 - Yes!                         

 - Okay, go and call the po-po. 
 - Shit.                        

     <i> I can't get a signal.</i>     

     Dwayne:<i> Yo, try email.</i>     
    <i> Maybe that still works.</i>    

        Good idea. I'm gonna try
        to email my assistant.  

       <i> All right, cool.</i>        

All right, y'all, the way       
I see it, we got two options.   

One, we try to make it back     
to the nearest cabin.           

That's 10 miles away.           

 Please.                        
 It's dark outside.             

Or we take our chances,         
go back in the house,           

 and wait for help.             

No way. I'm not going back      
in there with that maniac.      

    I ain't staying in here.    

    Look, Dwayne, you guys      
    brought us all up here.     

     This is your problem,      
     so fix it.                 

Why you always trying to do--   

   Look, why are we sitting here
   pointing fingers, huh?       

      <i> Now, we can't help</i>       
        <i> what happened.</i>         

       What we need to do is    
       focus on what to do next.

          And that is?          

<i> Survive. The storm is supposed</i> 
   <i> to break in the morning.</i>    

      I say we head back inside 
      and wait it out till then.

    - You call that a plan?     
 - You got a better one, Stacy? 

             Actually, I think  
             that's a good idea.

            If we stay in here, 
            we're sitting ducks.

        Exactly. Come on, y'all.
        Troy's only one person. 

          He can't kill us all. 

       We're safe as long as    
       we stick together, y'all.

Thank you. Finally somebody's   
using their brain.              

Yeah, okay, whatever.           
Let's just do something, please.

Then it's decided. We find      
a place to wait and hide.       

Push comes to shove...          

I got something for him.        

         What was that?         

            - What?             
            - What?             

Girl, don't start               
with this stuff.                

       No, I really heard       
       something.               

       It was coming from       
       over here I think.       

 It was making a ticking sound, 
 you know, like tick-tock.      

           Tick-tock.           

   - Tick-tock like a clock.    
   -<i> Yes, exactly like a--</i>      

             Sorry.             

Ooh, you're getting on          
my last nerves. You know what?  

  - I'm sorry.                  
  - Everybody just stay calm.   

   Stacy: Can we just get       
   to the game room, please?    

Okay. Before we go              
any further,                    

let's make sure                 
everybody's here.               

So when I yell out your name,   
just yell "check," okay?        

    - Freida?                   
    - ( indistinct chatter )    

"Check" is fine, Freida.        

           - Caprice?           
           - Check.             

            - Malik.            
            - Here.             

           - Johnny?            
           - Present.           

 - Stacy?                       
 - Don't be ridiculous, Monica. 

   What are we, preschoolers?   

      Freida: can you just      
      say "check"? Damn.        

All right, check.               
Happy now?                      

           Thank you.           
           Dwayne?              

          Yeah, baby.           

   - Greg?                      
   - ( whispers ) Yeah, here.   

    Okay, everybody's here.     

     <i> Wait. What about me?</i>      

            Why y'all act like  
            y'all just saw O.J.?

        ( women scream )        

            Johnny.             

           Oh, shit.            

We made it. We're alive.        
We're alive.                    

     Freida: We gonna die.      

No, not if we maintain          
our composure.                  

              We can't panic.   
              Do you understand?

       - We can't panic.        
       - Caprice:<i> Johnny?</i>       

                 Oh, my God,    
                 where's Johnny?

  No, no, Johnny!               

Caprice, just calm down, okay?  
I'm sure Johnny's all right.    

        No, he's not. He's dead.
        I know he's dead.       

   - He's not dead, Caprice.    
   - ( mutters )                

Oh, my God, Dwayne. You have to 
go out there and find Johnny.   

   Caprice, I think             
   that's a good idea, okay?    

  Look, Johnny's a smart guy.   
  He knows where we are.        

   We'll find him. He's probably
   just hiding out right now.   

Come on, in the meantime,       
I suggest that we all settle in 

    and try to remain calm.     

        Come on,                
        can you do that?        

        I promise you...        

     He's gonna show up,        
     all right? I promise.      

( sobs ) Oh, Johnny.            

        How much longer         
     are we gonna sit here?     

         Until the storm breaks,
         Greg.                  

It's been over half an hour     
since we heard anything,        

     <i> and I'm going crazy.</i>      

      Go get us some food, then,
      'cause I'm starving.      

How could you possibly          

think of eating                 
at a time like this, Freida?    

             Because I'm hungry.

              And besides, I got
              a fast metabolism.

Oh, so that's the problem.      

 <i> Look, y'all, Freida's right.</i>  

By the looks of the storm,      
we're gonna be here for a while.

          We need to find Johnny
          and get some supplies.

      <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>     

     Who's coming with me?      

          Honestly, I'd go, D...

          ( indistinct chatter )

          Greg. Greg.           

   Me?                          

Can I get back to you           
on that?                        

   Damn, I'm not going          
   back out there by myself,    

    and one of y'all need       
    to stay with the ladies,    
    so who's it gonna be?       

                I'll go, Dwayne.

 - This is pitiful, man.        
 - Hold on, Monica, I'm coming. 

   Wait, Malik. You don't have  
   to prove anything to anybody.

Stacy, look, I'm                
a grown-ass man, all right?     

          Really? So why are you
          shaking, then?        

     Let's go, D.               
     Let's go find Johnny.      

Maybe if I run into Troy,       

maybe I can get him to do me    
a special request.              

                   Funny, Malik.

You guys, be careful, okay?     

      ( cell phone rings )      

      - Wait, wait.             
        Maybe that's Hope.      
      - What?                   

        - That's weird.         
        - Dwayne:<i> What?</i>         

           All it says          
           is "picture loading."

        ( women scream )        

          Oh, my gosh!          

     <i> ( chainsaw revving  )</i>     

       Shoot him, Dwayne.       

   I can't! My gun's jammed!    
   Haul ass!                    

        Get in the room.        

     <i> ( chainsaw revving )</i>      

       Run, Caprice. Run.       

              Aah!              

   -<i> What are you doing?! </i>      
   - He was outside the door.   

           It's Caprice, though.
           Let her in.          

Wait, we don't know that        
for sure.                       

       Well, wait.              
       What should we do?       

What do you mean? It's Caprice! 
Let her in. Move, Stacy.        

   - What, you gonna move me?   
   - Get back.                  

Shh. Uh, quiet.                 

 Caprice, are you still there?  

      ( thunder crashes )       

     - ( chainsaw starts )      
     - Aah!                     

    - Caprice?                  
    -<i> That's it. Stand back.</i>    

      Everybody get back.       

      - Dwayne:<i> Damn it. </i>       
      - What's up?              

          Oh, my God.           

         It's Caprice.          
    Get away from the door.     

Back away from the door, baby.  
Back away from the door.        

        You killed her.         

He was right outside the door.  
What was I supposed to do?      

               Help your friend.

Yeah. That's kind of hard to do 
when you're dead, Monica.       

   Freida:<i> Look, she's right.</i>   
   <i> If we had let Troy in...</i>    

    <i> he probably would have</i>     
        <i> killed us all.</i>         

  - Does have a point, Monica.  
  - ( cell phone rings )        

          Aah. Oh, no.          

               Baby, what is it?

    It's Troy again.            
    He asking, "Who's next?"    

         Dwayne:<i> Shit!</i>          

 How did he get                 
 your phone number, anyway?     

Dwayne probably gave it to him. 
Ain't that right, Dwayne?       

   All right, that's enough,    
   Stacy. All right?            

 So what's our next move, man?  

         I don't know, man.     
         I don't know right now.

Why is he doing this?           

       Ain't it obvious? He's   
       getting rid of witnesses.

   We're the only ones who could
   bring him to justice.        

No, man. Something's wrong.     

       I'm telling y'all,       
     Troy is not a killer.      

  Okay, well, who else          
  could it be, then?            

             Wait. Wait. I know.

Who?                            

       Maybe it's the Boogeyman.

Stacy, baby.                    

    Right, Dwayne? Because      
    it couldn't possibly be     

the only person                 
unaccounted for in the house.   

Oh, no, that would just         
make too much sense.            

       Oh, Stacy, please.       

           Look, I know what it 
           seems like right now,

       but I cannot wrap my mind
       around the situation.    

Really? Okay, why don't you     
tell that to Dapny?             

No, better yet, Dwayne,         

why don't you go                
and talk to Johnny or Caprice   
for that matter                 

After all, you are              
somewhat responsible.           

                  Stacy, I said 
                  that's enough.

Stacy, it's my fault, okay.     
If you want to blame anybody,   
blame me.                       

I was the one who told Troy     
he could come.                  

    Monica, don't try to take   
    the blame for me, all right?

               You don't have to
               stick up for me. 

         It's half my decision  
         as much as it is yours.

      As for Stacy, if you      
      don't like my suggestions,

    you're more than welcome    
    to leave. The door is there.

      ( thunder rumbles )       

          That's what I thought.

Now, if you can't come up with  
something to help us,           

then I suggest                  
you chill the fuck out.         

      Hey, y'all, I got an idea.

    Why don't we flip the script

            and become          
            the hunters instead?

     No, seriously, Malik?      

Stacy, just hear me out         
on this one, all right?         

Now, the ball is in             
Troy's court now, right?        

He's controlling the game.      

He's got our backs to the wall, 
and he knows that we're afraid. 

        No shit, Kojak.         
        Why don't you tell us   
        something we don't know?

 So what do you want us to do,  
 go after Troy?                 

        - Yeah, why not?        
        - ( mutters )           

Aw, come on, y'all.             

             Malik, hold on now.

                Yo, Malik's     
                on to something.

                I'm telling you,
                think about it. 

      The last think Troy       
      would expect is an ambush.

        He's probably sitting   
        relaxing thinking we're 
        all cornered and scared.

Exactly, y'all. We can lure him 
into the open and jump him.     

    Ha ha. Sounds               
    fucking brilliant, guys.    

      Let me know how           
      it turns out, okay?       

      Don't sweat it, man. Look,
      if we're gonna do this... 

   we're gonna need something   
   that's gonna lure him out.   

       We need some bait        
       that gets him out.       

   -<i> What are we gonna</i>          
   <i>  use as bait? </i>              
   - Something he likes, man.   

    Uch, you must be hitting    
    the pipe with both hands    

   if you think I'm gonna go    
   for some mess like this.     

       Come on, Freida,         
       it's virtually foolproof.

     Yeah, and I ain't the fool.

We'll be with you the whole     
step of the way, all right?     

Every step of the way,          
we'll be right there with you.  

Now, once he gets too close,    
bam, we will blast his ass.     

             It'll work, Freida.

             Who do I look like,
             Dwayne, Boo Boo?   

      I ain't leaving this room,

    and there's nothing you can 
    say or do to change my mind.

             Absolutely,        
             positively nothing.

        Now, you sure this check
        ain't gonna bounce      

          when I try to cash it,
          right?                

  - Freida, you have my word.   
  - Mm-hmm.                     

     Look, I found some burgers.
     We're in business now.     

All right, run this by me again 
to make sure I'm clear.         

        All right, look,        
    you're gonna stay here.     

   <i> Malik and I, we're gonna</i>    
  <i> go over behind the counter.</i>  

      When Troy comes in,       
   just try to distract him.    

-<i> We'll take care of the rest. </i> 
What if something go wrong?   

 Come on, Freida, ain't nothing 
      gonna happen, baby.       

          <i> We got you.</i>          

  Now look, I'm trusting you    
  to use this if you have to.   

            Mm-hmm.             

                     Whoa, whoa.

Good luck.                      

                      All right.

      Hey, Monica, could we talk
      for a second?             

What is it, Greg?               

        Monica, I know you think
        I came up here          

      <i> to get you to sign</i>       
        <i> that contract.</i>         

  Now it's as if looking death  
          in the face           

   has given me an entire new   
     appreciation for life.     

      I mean, this whole        
      fucked-up nightmare       

      has made me realize       
       what's important.        

  You. You're important to me.  

   You really have no shame,    
            do you?             

    No, Monica, I'm serious.    

         I consider us          
  more than business partners.  

  <i> I mean, we're like family.</i>   

       <i> I'm your brother</i>        
     <i> from another mother.</i>      

     Oh, stop there, Greg.      

    The answer is still no.     

          Monica, please.       
          I'm begging, pleading.

            Don't do this to me.
            We need each other. 

No, Greg.                       
What is wrong with you?         

  In case you haven't noticed,  
 there's a psycho in the house, 

  and he's trying to kill us.   

   The last thing on my mind    
      is that stupid show       

     or your damn contract.     

          Now, please,          
      just leave me alone.      

    Okay. We'll talk later.     

          ( sizzling )          

        - Are we ready?         
        - Yeah.                 

      - Freida, you cool?       
      - Mm.                     

         Now look, you see Troy,

        remember to say his name
        loud and clear.         

      <i> That's the signal.</i>       

     All right, I got you.      

      ( thunder rumbles )       

     Man, this better work.     

   ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶    

             ¶ Me ¶             

    ¶ Happy birthday to me ¶    

      ¶ It's my birthday,       
       it's my birth-- ¶        

      ¶ It's my birthday ¶      

     Hold up. Aw, hell, no.     

    I know you ain't trying     
       to eat without me.       

        ( hinges creak )        

Yo, Freida,                     
you see anything?               

       Mnh-mnh, not yet.        

  So you still think            
  your cousin's innocent, huh?  

I'm not so sure anymore.        

       Them burgers smell gooder
       than a motherfucker.     

  <i> You ain't never lie, dawg.</i>   

           Yo, Freida, look out!

          ( screams )           

      That's what you get       
 for messing with Miss Freida.  

      <i> ( thunder rumbles )</i>      

You okay, baby?                 

          ( grunts ) Not really.

Look, I know this might not     
make you feel any better,       

but at least we're still here,  

and at least                    
we have each other.             

           I just don't know why
           he did it, Monica.   

     This ain't like Troy.      

Why don't you just go ask him?  

   ( door opens and closes )    

     ( footsteps approach )     

Looking for this?             
Ach. Thank God it's you, man. 

Come on, help me                
untie these ropes.              

        - Can't do that.        
        - How come, man?        

Come on, we cousins.            
Why you being like this?        

     Don't try to play me.      
You know what the fuck you did. 

          I don't know          
    what you talking about.     

    The killings. You killed    
 that girl and half my friends. 

   - Why?                       
   - For the millionth time.    

I didn't kill nobody, man.      
You got to believe me.          

    How do you explain your face
    on the 11:00 news           
    as a wanted murderer?       

That's all K.D., man.           

        Thought you said        
   you didn't know him, Troy.   

Okay, I lied,                   
but I ain't kill nobody.        

We was all chillin'.            
It was all good.                

K.D. got real hot.              
He started trippin' 'cause      
Shorty wouldn't let him hit it. 

    <i> I told him to be cool.</i>     
    <i> He don't listen to me.</i>     

Then I turned around,           
he was stabbing her, man.       

And he kept stabbing her,       
and I got scared, so I bounced. 

        You so innocent,        
 why don't we go to the police? 

'Cause K.D. and his people      
ain't no joke.                  

See, I'm not safely tucked away 
in the hill like you, bro.      

I'm on the streets.             

As soon as word got out         
that I snitched,                

then lights out,                
I ain't going out like that.    

So I figured I just hide out    
until they caught him.          

I never thought they was        
gonna finger me, too.           

  You talk a good game, Troy.   
   I ain't buying your shit.    

         You going down for what
         you did here tonight.  

I didn't do nothing.            
I swear, man.                   

  How do you explain this gun   
        I found on you?         

I stole that from K.D., man,    
for protection.                 

   What about you trying to     
   attack Freida in the kitchen?

I was after the burgers, man.   
I was hungry.                   

 Oh, yeah? And what's this, huh?
      Huh? What's all this?     

       Man, homeboy rich.       
 He ain't gonna miss that shit. 

      Why is it every time      
    something bad goes down,    

          your ass ain't nowhere
          to be found?          

Okay, I'm gonna be honest.      

I been kind of                  
robbing the place,              

but I swear on my mama, I never 
killed nobody in my life.       

On the real, though,            
you need to talk to your girl.  

          Who? Monica?          

Hell, yeah, I saw her dragging  
Caprice down the hallway.       

 - What you trying to say, man? 
 - I caught her red-handed.     
   It was her!                  

   - What you trying to say?    
   - She didn't see me.         

You trippin', man.              
You trippin'.                   

     Get out of here, man,      

before I'm the one that's end up
       wanted for murder.       

 Yo, Dwayne, I'm innocent, man. 
     You got to believe me.     

     Tell it to the police.     

    Dwayne, it was her, man.    

          ( mutters )           

¶ We shall overcome ¶           

 ¶ We shall overcome ¶          

   You know what? Keep it up,   
     and I will come over.      

          ( chuckles )          

¶ Kumbaya... ¶                  

         Greg, shut up.         

   Yes, please. Shut up.        

       Look, I'm getting worried
       about Dwayne.            

   - Malik, could you just--    
         - Say no more.         

        I'm on the case.        

         - Yo, Freida.          
         -<i> Yeah.</i>                

 - Can I have the gun, please?  
 - Unh-unh, my brother.         

   You gots to get your own.    

Guess it's official. Everybody's
     lost they damn minds.      

       -<i> Malik. </i>                
       - What now, Stacy?       

                Would you please
                be careful?     

I'll be fine.                   

          Yo, Dwayne.           

       You in here, man?        

               D.               

            Dwayne.             

               D.               

        Oh, shit. Fuck.         

  God, please give us a break.  

          Looking out.          

          Keys. Keys.           

            Jackpot.            

      Start, baby, start.       

       ( engine starts )        

        Yeah. Ha ha ha.         

            Girl...             

  Hey.                          

You okay?                       

                   I don't know.

 It just seems like every time  
 something good happens to me,  

         something bad          
   has to happen to me, too.    

      I mean, one minute,       

     it's the happiest day      
          of my life,           

      then the next minute,     
     I'm running for my life?   

   I don't know how much more   
      I can take of this.       

What are you                    
talking about, Monica?          

You are                         
a natural-born fighter.         

   <i> I don't know many people</i>    
      <i> who've been through</i>      
     <i> as much as you have.</i>      

  <i> I mean, with losing you mom</i>  
      <i> and all that drama</i>       
       <i> with your sister</i>        

     all at the same time.      

And even now,                   
in this crazy situation,        

you handling it, and not        
too many people can do that.    

        I really didn't         
        have a choice.          

   <i> No, we all have choices,</i>    

but it's what we choose         
to do with them that counts.    

Look, we both made it out of    
the bottoms of New Orleans.     

We gonna make it                
out of this, okay?              

          - All right.          
            - Okay.             

      ( thunder rumbles )       

                      Thank you.

No problem.                     

                  I needed that.

                            Aah!

         Easy, cowboy.          

Damn, Freida,                   
put that thing away.            

  Y'all, I think I found a way  
  out of here. Where's Malik?   

   - Where's Malik?             
   - He went looking for you.   

   What? Stay in here,          
   lock the door, and don't move
   until I get back.            

What is it, baby?               
What's wrong?                   

          Just do what I say,   
          all right? Okay? Damn.

        ( door closes )         

                    Don't worry.

Malik is dead, isn't he?        

                   I don't know.

  <i> I just don't know anymore.</i>   

             Malik.             

 Malik.                         

Come on, 'lik.                  

   Troy!                        

   I'm gonna kill you, Troy!    

      I'm gonna kill you!       

     What is going on?          
     What's taking them so long?

Relax, Monica. We tied          
that fool up pretty good.       

Troy can't come in here         
and hurt any of us anymore.     

      ( cell phone rings )      

                     ( screams )

  What?                         

"Four down, five to go.         
Who's next?"                    

     That's not right.          
     Only three people are dead.

                Caprice, Johnny,
                and Dapny.      

   - Who's the fourth person?   
   - Dwayne.                    

      - Malik.                  
      - No, Stacy, Stacy.       

Wait a minute. Let me go.       
I done had enough of this.      

           Oh, shit.            

                       Oh, baby.

Monica, what are you            
doing out here?                 

I thought I told you            
to stay in the room.            

        - Are you okay?         
        - I'm fine.             

             I thought something
             happened to you.   

Malik's dead.                   

                           What?

I think he found Troy           
trying to escape.               

         Oh, my God. What are we
         gonna do now?          

I think I found                 
a car outside and it runs.      

              Okay. I'll go tell
              the others.       

Have everybody meet me          
out front, all right?           

  - I'll bring the car around.  
  - Be careful.                 

Hurry up. I'll be fine.         

      So glad when this is over.

        I do have other clients,
        you know.               

Don't care if it ever           
rains again in my entire life.  

      ( thunder rumbles )       

Think they'll give Troy         
the chair?                      

Maybe I could option his story  
for a movie of the week.        

                   Greg, please.

Aw, you're right.               

Can only hope for               
an after-school special.        

             They're leaving us.

They're trying to leave us.     

 Greg:<i> Monica wouldn't do that.</i> 
     <i> She's my best client.</i>     

Well, guess what.               
Your best client just left you. 

     I can't believe this.      

  <i> Yeah, if they think they're</i>  
   <i> leaving us high and dry,</i>    

<i> they got another think coming.</i> 
         <i> Now come on.</i>          

     <i> We need to find Malik</i>     
 <i> and get the hell out of here.</i> 

     <i> Move your ass, Greg!</i>      

          Yes, ma'am.           

      What are you doing?       

             Do you even know   
             where we're headed?

        Been walking in circles.

Would you shut up               
so I can concentrate?           

Oh, thank God.                  
There you are.                  

Look, Dwayne found a way out,   
so come on. Follow me.          

        Where's Freida?         

              Where's Freida?   
              No, where's Malik?

       I'm sorry, Stacy.        

        <i> Malik is dead.</i>         

It looks like Troy escaped      
and killed him.                 

            <i> Sorry.</i>             

      Okay. Look, it's all about
      my survival right now.    

And right now what I want to    
know is where the fuck is Dwayne

              and when the fuck 
              is he coming back?

      He found an old car       
        out by the shed,        

        and he should be        
 bringing it around any minute. 

We have to meet him out there.
That is bullshit, Monica.     

           I saw you get        
           in the Jeep with him,

      and the two of you        
      were planning to leave us.

      No. No, you didn't.       

  I was upstairs looking for you
  and Greg and Freida.          

 You really expect me to believe
 that load of garbage?          

        Look, Greg and I saw you
        sitting in that Jeep    

       as plain as day, so don't
       you dare try to deny it. 

   Greg:<i> Monica, we saw you.</i>    

What are you guys talking about?
       I was right here.        

    Cut the soap-opera bullshit,
    Miss Baby Gurl.             

                It is not flying
                with me, okay?  

Look, Stacy, listen to me.      

    <i> I promise you, I swear,</i>    
      <i> I was right here--</i>       

         Uh, ladies...          

Monica:<i> Who you calling a liar?</i> 

           Ladies...            

    ( both arguing at once )    

         <i> Uh, l-ladies.</i>         

       ( whistles ) Hey!        

      - What, Greg?             
      - What is it, Greg?       

              I think you should
              see this.         

             Oh, my God, Dwayne.

            <i> Dwayne!</i>            

     ( indistinct chatter )     

                    Come on. No.

 ( screams )                    

He's dead. He's dead.           
We have to get back to the room.

             He's right, Monica.

         -<i> Oh, no! </i>             
         -<i> He's right.</i>          

     ( indistinct ranting )     

Monica, I am so sorry.          

This just doesn't make          
any sense.                      

   If he was able to get Dwayne,
   we don't stand a chance.     

    Wait. Oh, my God.           
    Freida. Where's Freida?     

She went to look for you.       

    Oh, my--                    
    We have to find Freida.     

                 M-Monica, wait.

      <i> ( thunder rumbles )</i>      

Wait. You're not leaving me     
in here by myself.              

                 Move it, Stacy.

         You're right.          

          Who's there?          

    Oh, no. Troy, you trying    
   to catch us sleeping, huh?   

    <i> Make me come over there</i>    
      <i> and blast your ass.</i>      

     It's your last chance.     

              Aah!              

      Oh, my God, Freida.       

      ( thunder rumbles )       

    Shouldn't we be running     
   in the opposite direction?   

             Shit.              

           <i> Caprice?</i>            

     ( knife being thrown )     

          ( screams )           

          <i> Oh, Freida.</i>          

           Why is he doing this?

     - I'm out of here.         
     - ( cell phone rings )     

Wait, Stacy.                    

           - Jesus!             
           - Oh, God.           

Come on, let's get to the car.  
Let's go!                       

         Monica:<i> Quick,</i>         
    <i> let's get to the Jeep.</i>     

    Wait. Don't come any closer.
    Don't come any closer.      

             Where my cousin at?
             What are y'all deaf
             or something?      

             Where my cousin at?

        Okay, it's okay.        

Troy, Dwayne's dead.            

You killed him.                 

                           What?

But the killing                 
doesn't have to continue.       

     What are you talking about?
     Man, shut up. Shut up, man.

               Shut the fuck up.

Listen to me, Troy,             
If you put the knife down now,  

this can all end right here.    

          You got a lot of nerve
          telling me this.      

 I saw you kill Caprice, and you
 probably killed Dwayne, too.   

        But right now, I'm gonna
        kill you. Get your--    

            Tell your white boy 
            to put the gun down.

      Greg, shoot his ass.      

         Troy, you don't have to
         do this. Please.       

Greg, what are you waiting for?!
         Shoot his ass!         

  - Let her go.                 
  - Fuck you. This for Dwayne.  

           Shoot him!           

    Greg:<i> Did you see that?</i>     

Monica:<i> Why was he accusing me?</i> 

     He's a psychopath, and     
     that's what psychopaths do.

        - Now let's go.         
        - Wait.                 

        <i> Where's Stacy?</i>         

The Jeep!                       

          Stacy, wait!          

         Sorry, Dwayne.         

                   What a bitch.

      ( engine sputters )       

       Come on, damn it.        

Oh, my God. Oh, no.             

  Come on, you piece of shit.   

         Shit. Damn it.         

              Aah!              

             Aah!               

                Stacy, run. Run.

       -<i> ( gunshot ) </i>           
       - Get out of here!       

      ( Stacy screaming )       

                Monica, get back
                in the house.   

              Aah!              

      I did. I shot Troy.       

      No. No, it can't be.      

  I don't understand. If Troy   
  isn't the killer, then who--  

       You're so stupid.        

            No. No.             

Guess I won't be needing        
those anymore.                  

  Hey, Monica, is that any way  
   to greet your big sister?    

     Greg:<i> Oh. You know what</i>    
<i> this could do for Sweeps Week?</i> 

 - Please tell me you can act.  
 -<i> Shoot her, Greg.</i>             

     - She's crazy.             
     - Don't call me crazy!     

    Somebody could get shot.    

         Damn.                  
         This job is killing me.

          <i> Greg. Greg.</i>          

              Sign the contract,
              Monica.           

              Don't let the show
              die like this.    

        Don't die, Greg.        

I'll sign!                      
I'll sign!                      

        Oops, too late.         

    Don't worry, little sis.    
I'll sign the contract for you. 

   Why did they let you out?    
  You're obviously still sick.  

       I let myself out.        

That place is for crazy people. 
Do I look crazy to you?         

         Why are you doing this?

                  When Mom died,
                  I took you in.

           I even gave you a job
           on my show,          

            <i> and you still tried</i>
            <i> to kill me.</i>        

              Aah!              

       And now you killed       
        all my friends.         

First of all, that wasn't a job.
       I was your flunky.       

Yeah, I tried to kill you, and I
killed all your stupid friends, 

  and I'm gonna kill you now,   
but that doesn't mean I'm crazy.

        That just means         
  I'm very fucking pissed off!  

    How'd you even find me?     

 I stopped by your fancy house  
          in the hills          

   and took a few souvenirs.    

       Dwayne's sidekick.       
          My car keys.          

Yeah. Remind me to thank        
your late, great boyfriend      

for leaving such detailed       
directions behind.              

Once I had those,               
it wasn't hard to find          

 <i> a group of bougie-ass niggas</i>  
      <i> on a camping trip.</i>       

            But why?            
    Why kill all my friends?    

    The don't have anything     
        to do with this.        

   They're the only ones that   
   know how to tell us apart.   

 And we both know there's only  
room for one of us in Hollywood.

     <i> I couldn't have your</i>      
 <i> little buddies spoil my plan.</i> 

    It won't work, Veronica.    

  Everyone will know that you   
broke out of that insane asylum 

     and tried to kill us.      

   That's where you're wrong.   
     It's the perfect plan.     

   Troy, the wanted convict,    
        takes the blame,        

<i>you get to visit Mom in heaven,</i> 

      and I get to return       
     to my own hit TV show.     

 And now, it's time to complete 
       the perfect plan.        

         So long, sis.          
    Give my regards to Mom.     

           ( click )            

     Come back here, bitch!     

  You can't run forever, Mon!   

              Uhh.              

          You can run,          
      but you can't hide.       

           ( grunts )           

         Where are you?         

     Getting tired of this.     

              Aah!              

    Why are you doing this?     

   Ugh. Getting my life back    
        and yours free!         

          ( sobbing )           

    You don't have the guts.    

             Drop the ax, bitch.

      Shoot her. She tried      
     to kill you, remember?     

     No, Troy, shoot her.       
     She's my twin sister.      

She killed Dwayne.              

              She's lying.      
              She killed Dwayne.

  No.                           

This is some fucking weird shit.
     Y'all got some issues.     

Both of y'all shut the fuck up. 

   That's for Dwayne, bitch.    

Oh, thank you.                  
Thank you.                      

Thank you. I'm so sorry         
I blamed you.                   

I should've known you couldn't  
do anything like this.          

         It's all right, Shorty.
         I'm used to it, man.   

        Niggas like me always   
        getting blamed for shit.

But you're not hurt.            
But how? I saw--                

   Who says crime don't pay?    

Well, I'm just glad you're okay.

    Now come on. We have to     
 get out of here and find help. 

      We can't just leave       
    everyone here like this.    

               Yeah. I feel you.

Damn, man.                      

  Fuck.                         

Damn, this bitch                
killed everybody.               

I got to roll.                  

          Wait for me.          

Oh, no, can't do that, cuz.     
I roll solo.                    

        What? You can't just    
        leave me here by myself.

     Besides, how you even gonna
     get down the mountain?     

             Both cars are dead.

 I'm walking.                   

Oh, don't be stupid.            
The next town is 10 miles away. 

Look, Veronica stole my car,    

so it's got to be               
out there somewhere, right?     

You go look for the car,        
I'll go look for the keys.      

  Aw'ight, but when we get to   
    the bottom of the hill,     

        I got to bounce.        

          And, Troy...          

             Yeah?              

          Be careful.           

   Oh, don't worry about me,    
     Shorty. I'm straight.      

     Now stay dead, bitch.      

Come on, I found the car.       
Let's bounce.                   

          You think             
          she's really dead now?

Hell, yeah, that bitch dead.    

               Did you shoot her
               in the head?     

Yeah. Yeah.
