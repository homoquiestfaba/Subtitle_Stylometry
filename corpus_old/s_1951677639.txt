Hello.

Breathing pretty heavy
over there.

Just a dream.

You sure you're okay?

Do you want me to leave
or something?

No, stay.
I'm gonna go get some air.

You know you got two
different shoes on, right?

One's a little newer
than the other.

Anything else?

Thanks for stopping by.

What the hell
did you just do?

How did you get up there?

Be strong, fellows.
We going, baby. Come on.

One of us has to move on
some of that. Oh, yeah?

Well, some of us already have.
Hi, Dory.

Hey, Tommy. Hey, Dan!

Looking good,
all right.

Thanks, Trev.

Referring to the endless array
of women, dickhead.

How can they all be in love
with me? Exactly, how can they?

Incoming, gentlemen.

Oh, my sweet mama and papa.

See that smile she gave us?
Yeah. Looked like a toothpaste ad.

Whitest teeth
I've ever come across.

Faster, faster!
Punch hard, punch hard.

Heel! Good!
All right, Jensen.

You work hard and you get
results. That's how it happens.

Nice, Kyle.

Excellent.

Now, who else has some good
stuff to show me today, huh?

All right, Millman. Nice.

Tight. Lower your shoulders.
Good. Keep it tight.

Good, good.

I want to show you something, Coach.
Don't waste energy. Keep that mouth shut.

Good.

Millman. Millman!

Sorry, Coach.

Sorry doesn't mean anything.

I can do this.

I've been working on it.

Get over here!

Nobody on this planet can do
what you are trying to do.

You are great up there, Danny.
You're one of the best I've seen.

You're gonna rank even higher
than you did last year,

and you might make it
through all the qualifiers if

you don't
kill yourself first.

Tommy, you're up.

What's he trying to do?

Three consecutive flips
before he dismounts.

Anybody ever done that?
Nope.

That's why
he's trying to do it.

Thinks it's gonna make him
lord of the rings.

Only, with Middleman, it's where he tries
to tear both arms out of their sockets.

All right, the next qualifying
heat is six weeks from today,

and you know what I say.

Don't think
this is gonna happen

just 'cause you're pretty
and can do a handstand.

You think I'm kidding?

And I've got footage of your
competition you need to see again.

Help you with something?

You can tell me
how you did it.

You like things explained.

Don't you?

How we doing tonight?

Look.

That roof's gotta be at
least 10, maybe 12 feet high.

No human can make a vertical
leap over four or five feet, tops.

I know. I'm a gymnast.

Toughest men's sport in the
world. Most people don't know that.

The Spartans of ancient Greece
were gymnasts, too.

They vaulted over bulls.

Trained their elite warriors
that way.

Did you know that?

I know more than you think. And
you think more than you know.

But knowledge is
not the same as wisdom.

Yeah? What's the difference?

You know how to clean a
windshield, right? Yeah.

Wisdom is doing it.

I train seven days a week,
50 weeks out of the year.

Why so much?
Are you serious?

I am a heartbeat away
from qualifying.

Qualifying for what?

You watch the Olympics?
No.

Thanks for stopping by.

Look, even as good as I am,

I gotta do everything I can
to make sure that I qualify.

There's a lot you'd have to know before
you could understand what you saw.

Go. Ask me.
Ask me something.

Ask me anything.

Are you happy?

You said
I could ask you anything.

What does happy
have to do with anything?

Everything.

My dad's got plenty of cash,

school's kind of a breeze,
I get straight A's.

I got great friends,
I'm in great shape,

and I only sleep alone
when I absolutely want to.

So why can't you
sleep at night?

Yesterday, you came here
at 3:00 a. m. Now, tonight.

That's two nights in a row.

What are you? Some kind of a Quickie
Mart philosopher or something like that?

You need some philosophy?

No, thanks, Socrates.
I get enough at school.

Last question.

If you don't make the Olympic
team, what will you do?

If I don't what?

You must have thought
about it.

What the hell
are you talking about?

What's the problem?

I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

You're a freak. And I don't
need you freaking me out.

Thirteen.

Fourteen.

Your exit sign's lit, Middleman.

Fifteen.

Sixteen.

Hey, there, beautiful thing.
So, this is what you do for fun.

Seventeen.

Eighteen.

Did I pick up that maybe you and
Dory hooked up the other night?

Come on, Dan-o.
It's all you.

Nineteen.

She told you that?
Is it true?

We're supposed to be friends,
man.

What does
that mean, exactly?

It means you're a jerk who
treats his friends like dirt.

Somebody grab my beers.

Somebody grab mine!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Come on, guys.

Hey, Dan, what's the matter
with you, man?

With friends like you, who
needs assholes, right, Dan-o?

Calm down. What? You
want to fight Tommy?

Who does he think he is? He's
pissed at you, all right? Is it true?

I thought Dory was old news.
All right?

So, excuse me if she
comes banging on my door.

Why? Why, Dan?

Listen to yourself.
Dory was Tommy's girl.

I said I thought it was over!

Just go back
to your party, man.

Okay. Yeah, I will.

Hey.

You want these?

You're really cute.

Jesus!

Susie, you okay?

Yeah.

Sorry.

What's the matter?

Couldn't sleep again?

What would you say
if I told you

that I keep seeing those shoes
in a dream I keep having?

I'd say maybe
you're still asleep.

You can live a whole lifetime
without ever being awake.

Hey, Socrates.

If you know so much,

how come you're working
at a gas station?

This is a service station.
We offer service.

There's no higher purpose.

Than pumping gas?
Service to others.

How we doing tonight?

Japanese style, huh?

So you know Socrates?

Is that what you call him?

I bet he loves that.

You eat here with him
every night?

Actually,
I think one's for you.

I see you've met Joy.

Hey, big Buddha.
Hi, little Buddha.

Joy, this is Dan.

We met.

Socrates.
Socrates.

Bon app√©tit.

You look hungry.

Joy do all that?

She live around here?

She related to you
or something?

You need to start asking
better questions.

What?

Slow down.
You might taste something.

You sure got a lot of rules
about stuff, don't you?

Not rules. Things I've learned
from my own life experience.

That's why I'd say
your eating is sloppy.

Who cares?
You do.

That's the difference
between us, Dan.

You practice gymnastics.
I practice everything.

If I was your trainer,
no meat.

Seriously?
None.

I could probably
handle that.

No TV, no alcohol,
no drugs and no sex.

And that's why I'm glad
you're not my trainer.

So, this diet and your training
are making you all you can be?

Absolutely.

So, how long
can you stand like this?

Name it.

Five minutes. On the table.
Done.

You move so much as a muscle,

and I get to call you Jack
for the rest of the night.

Jack?
Short for jackass.

What time is it?

What time is it?

What time

is

it?

What

time

is...

My son, Jack.

Thanks for stopping by.

Everyone tells you what to do
and what's good for you.

They don't want you
to find your own answers.

They want you
to believe theirs.

And let me guess.
You want me to believe yours.

No.

I want you to stop gathering
information from outside yourself

and start gathering it
from the inside.

What are you, part of
some cult or something?

People are afraid
of what's inside,

and that's the only place they're
ever gonna find what they need.

Why can't you sleep?

Is it because,
maybe, late at night,

when all the noise dies down and
you're lying there in the bed,

and there's nobody around but you,
then, maybe, you get a little scared?

Scared because suddenly
everything feels so

empty.

You tell me you want to be more than
just someone who gets up on those rings

and performs
a well-practiced stunt or two.

You tell me
you want to be someone

who uses his mind and his body

in ways that most people would
never have the courage to,

and I will train you, Dan,

to be a real warrior.

Is he all right?

What's going on?

Kyle. He took a bad fall.

It's fine. I'm fine.

It might be broken.
No.

We'll need an x-ray.
No.

It's all right, Kyle. It's
all right. It's all right.

I mean it, Coach.
I know.

It doesn't feel like a break.

They're just gonna have
a look at it, that's all.

I don't need it looked at.

And I said you did.

Let's go.

Put it in a sling.
I don't need a sling.

Rider down, man.
Bad break.

You don't know that.
It could be a sprain.

I mean, he's a casualty,
Tommy-boy. He's our best horse man.

Where do you think
that leaves us, huh?

Trevor, get off that thing.

Or what?
Like you don't want it?

Except you suck
at the pommel horse, Middleman.

I just never focused on it.

That's 'cause you got
one big show and only one.

Lord of the rings.

Yeah? Want to see
what I can do?

Don't embarrass yourself.
Go play, little boy.

Jesus Christ, did you both
just see them take Kyle away?

I mean, Jesus,
what if he's done?

Don't get in my face about it, all right?
Jesus, go hold his hand if you want to.

Sometimes,
I don't like myself very much.

My first thought was about how maybe
Kyle's fall could work out for me.

People are not their thoughts.

They think they are and it
brings them all kinds of sadness.

Toss me that wrench.

I'm not what I think?

Of course not.

The five-eighths.

The mind is just
a reflex organ.

It reacts to everything.

Fills your head with millions
of random thoughts a day.

None of those thoughts
reveal any more about you

than a freckle does
at the end of your nose.

Take a swing at me.
What?

What are you doing?

Come on. 10 bucks if you
can slap me on the cheek.

Come on. Take a shot.

Knock it off, man.
I don't want to hit you.

You don't want to hit me?

I don't want to hurt you.

I guess I'll just have to
keep slapping you then.

Did you notice how the right
leverage can be very effective?

What if I were to tell you

that's what your training,
even your life, is about?

Developing the wisdom
to apply the right leverage

in the right place,
at the right time.

Take out the trash.
You take out the trash.

The trash is up here.

That's the first part
of your training,

learning to throw out everything
you don't need in here.

How?

Meet me tomorrow on campus.

Strawberry Creek bridge.

Where the hell are you going?
Poli-sci. Where are you going?

I'm going to pommel horse
try-outs.

I forgot.

Less than an hour.
Hey, hey! Wait up.

Tell them to hold up
for me, all right? What?

Soc!

Soc!

Listen.
I totally forgot about this.

Now, I got this thing
at the gym.

It's pretty important.
Can we make this quick?

Sure.

Hey!

Hey! I'm talking to you.

What the hell is wrong with you?
You said you were in a hurry.

So you pushed me off the
bridge? I emptied your mind.

You what?
I emptied...

No, you didn't.
You threw me into the river.

And while you were falling, tell
me, Dan, what were you thinking of?

I don't know!

Were you thinking about school? No!

Grocery shopping?
No!

This thing you had to
hurry off to? No! I was...

The present.

Devoted 100% to the experience
you were having.

You even had a word for it.

You're out of your mind.
You know that?

It's taken
a lifetime of practice.

We want you
out of your mind, too, Dan.

What is that you do?

Some kind of
martial arts move?

I didn't see it coming.
You weren't paying attention.

Even now you're not.
Your mind's filling up again.

You're missing out
on everything that's going on.

There's nothing going on.

There's never
nothing going on.

Take out the trash, Dan.

The trash is anything that is keeping
you from the only thing that matters,

this moment.

Here.

Now.

And when you truly are
in the here and now,

you'll be amazed at what you can
do and how well you can do it.

Until we know more about Kyle,
we need the horse covered, so...

Anybody who wants
a shot at it, gets a shot.

Where's Millman?

All right,
next man up. Trev?

You know I'm superstitious,
Coach. I gotta go last.

I'll go.

All right.

Millman, where the hell
did that come from?

Soc!

Hot damn! I wish you could've
been there. You would've loved it!

I used your trick.

I used your mind trick and it worked.
It totally worked. I was awesome.

It's not a trick. Yeah, well,
whatever it is, I used it.

I took out the trash,
and I mean Trev?

Trev's the one guy
I'm always going up against.

You should have seen me.
I demolished the guy.

You know, I wasn't worried
about what did happen,

or what might happen,
what could happen.

I just got up there
and I cleared my mind.

And I was flawless.

Listen, I'm jumping in
with both feet. All right?

Whatever you tell me to do, I'm gonna do.
No beer, no meat, no girls, no problem.

How long did you stay
that way, clear and flawless?

"I demolished that guy.
You should have seen me. "

You're in the past.

Gloating.

You're not in the now, living.

You haven't learned anything.

Go home.
Training's over for tonight.

Wait a minute.

Wait a minute.

Go home, I said.

Hey, Dan.

Why do we have to be all the way up
here, where we could kill ourselves?

I was hoping
you could tell me.

God!

What do I keep trying for?

I'll never make this cut.

Dad was right.

I'm gonna make him right if
I don't find a way to do this.

Will I ever forgive myself
if I don't make this cut?

Where the hell is Millman?

Too good to show up
for practice, now, I guess.

I don't know how to handle these
kids. What do I say to them?

They're talking,
but their lips aren't moving.

I'm not their mother.
I'm their coach.

Coach thinks
I'm worthless.

I am worthless.

I'm a worthless piece of shit

and Millman's always
gonna be better than me.

Am I reading their minds?

Maybe you just never really
listened to them before.

I've only got four qualifiers
left. I've got to get new mats.

I can't stick this double double.
My line's not straight on the bar.

I'm such a worthless
piece of shit.

You gotta be doing this.
Otherwise I'm losing my mind.

Sometimes you have to lose your
mind before you come to your senses.

Millman!

It's about time you showed up.

Thanks for joining us.

Go home, I said.

What did you just do to me?

You have to be strong
if you're gonna do this, Dan.

What did you do?

Where I'm gonna take you, some
of the things I'm gonna show you,

you're gonna need strength.

And you're gonna need
to trust me.

So it's hot as hell,
and this penguin,

he's pushing his broken-down
car past the 31 flavors.

So, suddenly he's practically
burying his face in a large vanilla

when he sees
a service station.

So he goes over, the mechanic
opens up the hood and says,

"Looks to me
like you've blown a seal. "

The penguin wipes his mouth and says,
"Hey, screw you! It's ice cream. "

What's up, Tommy?
Hey, Trev.

Hey, what's up with
the rabbit chow, Middleman?

All right, I got another one.

A man, a duck and a big-breasted
nun walk into a bar, right?

So, this old guy
did this high jump.

Did this really high jump.

And?

I'm kind of doing
what he tells me

so I can find out
how he did it.

Wait a minute.

You're letting somebody
else coach you? No.

Well, what's he doing to you?
'Cause you look like crap.

I don't know.

I don't know
what he's doing to me.

You better get away from it,
Middleman.

We got qualifiers in four weeks and you're
looking like a worthless piece of shit.

Hey!

Joy, right?
Mmm-hmm.

I need to talk to you
about our mutual friend.

Socrates?

If he didn't tell you his
name, you won't get it from me.

Yeah, why didn't he tell me?

I mean, I don't know anything
about the guy.

I'm serious.

All right? He's supposed to be making
me stronger, making my life better.

It's just the opposite.

What's he doing?

What are you worried about?

I want to know
who I'm dealing with here.

Come on, come on.
Tight. Keep it tight, Danny!

No! No, you're shaking!
You're shaking!

What the hell
are you doing up there?

Yeah, I'm off today.

Oh. You're off, huh?

Well, you've been off for
one hell of a streak, Millman.

First you're a dream on the horse and
now you can barely stand up straight.

Huh?

Next time you're tired, go take a
nap instead of coming to practice.

Ike, your key?
Yep, all right.

Voyeur.

How we doing tonight?

How am I doing?

I'm tired, I'm hungry
and I'm horny.

How are you doing?

I need some answers tonight.

I need to know that this...

That this is all going somewhere,
and I need to know it right now.

I mean, what kind of a warrior trains
by sitting around scrubbing toilets?

When you become a warrior, you
learn to meditate in every action.

Scrubbing toilets?
Letting go of attachments.

Like your pride.

Giving up your addictions. Yeah,
name one thing I'm addicted to.

Talking.
Especially interrupting.

Knowing everything,
when in fact you know nothing.

You really think that this is going
to expand my awareness of anything?

My game is off! My coach
probably thinks that I'm on drugs,

and I'm thinking...

I just don't have any more
time for you right now.

All you have is right now,
Jack.

Did you just call me
a jackass again?

'Cause, you know, I'm really starting
to wonder how someone with the life

that you've managed to put
together can teach me anything.

I mean, are you really happy?

Maybe you're just a case of someone
who, not having made much of themselves,

says that the world is lost and
all these things don't matter.

Be happy with less, right? Less
than what? Less than nothing?

I call you a jackass
when you act like a jackass.

Like now, Dan, when you're
letting your emotions control you.

This isn't emotion!
This is common sense!

You know what?
Let me tell you something,

whatever your name really is.

When I get what I want,
I'll be happy.

For real and forever and
anything else I say it'll be.

'Cause I will make it happen.

Three, two, one!

Drink! Drink! Drink!

Danny, good.

That's it, Danny.

Steady.

Good. All right, come on!
Bring it home!

That's what I remember about
you, Millman! You were good.

I needed this.

Needed to escape.

Lucky me.
Yeah, and lucky me.

You guys
are in such great shape.

So if I wasn't
in such great shape,

wasn't on the gymnastics team,
just had a regular body,

you wouldn't be into me?

If I didn't have this body,
would you be into me?

Hey, Middleman.

I don't know what to say.

Hey.

Got the whole team here.

You ran a red light, man.
Can you believe that?

You gotta get better, man,
'cause...

You ran a red light.

...whose ass
am I gonna kick at practice?

Don't waste your energy.
Keep that mouth shut.

Dan?

Dan?
