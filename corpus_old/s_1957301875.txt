Here it is --

four years after
my mother's death,

and it seems as if
everyone has moved on

except for me.

The reflections
of my hurt and pain

have had a tendency
to stagnate me.

It used to take me only
a day or two to write a song,

but I've been
picking this song up

and putting it back down
going on about four years now.

Where did all my inspiration go?

Where are all the answers
to the questions in my head?

Lord, I don't hear
your voice anymore.

Have you left me, too?

Have you left me, too, Lord?

Have you left me, too?

-Man, it is hot as hell in here.

It don't make no sense.

You know I was downtown.

I think I seen Harriet Tubman
catching a cab.

-You got that right.

-Yeah, you sure right.

But it ain't too hot for you
to grind it out in that studio,

though, right?

-Well, I was thinking.

-You ought to be trying
to come up with a song

that's gonna be a big hit
on the R&B charts

and stop thinking.

You need to be writing!

-No, Freddy, Alicia.

She wants to enter this new
songwriters competition,

and if she wins, then,
you know --

-Listen, listen, listen.

If she don't win,
and she loses,

tell her she's got a job
at my law office,

or on my new record label.

The same go for you.

-No thanks to
the office thing, bro.

It's a gospel competition.
-Uh-huh.

It's gonna be held
at the Berklee School of Music.

So if she wins, she'd get
some scholarship money.

-Oh, that's cool.

-I just need to be,
uh, you know,

trying to find the money
to help her be able to do it.

So I was, you know...

-I can't help you, sorry.

But I see she's following
in the footsteps

of her famous daddy.

-Real funny, Fred.

My break is on the way,
I'm telling you.

What is wrong with you?
What is --

Man, you know,
you going through something.

You need some of them
little Prozac.

That's what you need.

You having them
mood swings, man.

One day, you're talking
about doing one thing,

and the next thing,
you're talking about

doing something
totally different.

"Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, Fred, man.

I think I'm gonna leave
this R&B thing alone,

and I'm going to focus
on my music and my ministry."

That's what you be saying, man.
Your moods be changing.

Hey, look, man, you got
something to drink in here?

Oh, okay.

-I'll have you know
I still am, bro.

I'm just doing R&B
to help me get the gospel.

That's all.

-Let me get this right --

You're going to use
the Devil's doors

to get into God's house?

-Look who's preaching.

I can talk...
'cause I grew up with you.

I know you.

Look, I know
all about your dreams

and all your aspirations,

all the things that you've
ever thought about, Gary.

You share them with me, man,

and there's a lot of things
people want to be

that simply ain't
meant for them.

Dude, you're 35 years old, man.

You got a kid.

You're not gonna be
no R&B singer.

I-I-I keep trying to get you
to grasp that concept, man.

Ain't gonna happen.

You ain't gonna be, uh, uh, uh,
no little Teddy Pendergrass.

Or little Luther Vandross, man.

I'm telling you.

You don't seem to get it.

You know what?
You know what I've been doing?

I've been worshipping God
on my face.

Mm-hmm, prostrate
and everything.

-Really?
-And you know what he told me?

He been talking, too.
Do you know what he told me?

Nothing.

-Exactly.
-[ Laughs ]

Man, I ain't been to church
in a long time, though.

I don't -- Guess what.

I don't even believe in God
no more.

Uh-huh.

[ Speaking gibberish ]

Mamasay mamasa mamakusa!

I think I'm feeling
a touch from God.

Mm-hmm!

Hallelujah!

Yes, Jesus!

You remember Pastor Jones?

Remember he used to say,

"If the God you serve
is so powerful,

and he supplies you
with all your needs

according to his riches
and his glory, ha,

then why, my brother, ha,

why, my brother,

are you still so poor,
and you're so broke?

Ha, uh-huh.

If the God you serve
is so powerful,

then why, my brother,

are you still calling
all your friends

to drive you to and from
the work? Huh-huh.

If the God you serve
is so powerful, uh-huh,

then why is your home
going into foreclosure,

and you're calling me, saying,
'Freddy, huh, Freddy, huh,

Freddy, can I borrow
a little money?'

and I say, "No, you can't.

No, you can't."

Somebody say yeah!

Yeah, ha-ha!

Somebody say hallelujah!

Somebody say, God is real!

No, he ain't, ha-ha!

Hello, somebody.
Hello, church.

Oh, you don't want
to say nothing to me?

I say hello, lights.
Hello, lights.

Hello, lights.
-Real funny.

-Hello...

A-ha.

-I'm just messing
with you, man.

-And the first shall be last,

and the last shall be first.
-Shall be first.

You've been using
that same tired line

since high school, man,

and you're still in last place,

and you're still broke.

-Where all this criticism
come from, bro?

-Man, I'm not
criticizing you, man.

I'm playing with you, man.
I'm your buddy.

-[ Sighs ]
-You know what, man,

you a little defensive.

You need that Prozac.

You know what, bro?
I'm messing with you.

You know what you need?

Know what you need?

You need a drink.

-Oh, really.
-Yeah, yeah.

Me, you, and the fellas
go down, hang out,

have a couple of drinks,

bring a couple of ladies.

You remember Anna?

Pow, pow, Anna!
Pow, pow, Anna!

You know what I'm saying?

Hey, look at me, baby.

You know how Freddy do it, baby.

-I know how Freddy do it, baby.

And that's what I'm afraid of.

-What's that supposed
to mean, man?

-Well, I'm just saying,
you know, bro, you -- you --

you -- you -- you know,
you a little free

with the ladies.
-No, no, no.

It's more like the ladies are
a little free with me, player.

Uh-huh.
-Oh, they free with you?

-Uh-huh.
-Okay.
-Free with Freddy.
-Okay.

-I call them Free Freddy.

Mm-hmm.

Uh-huh.

And I don't know why
you talking, Mr. I'm Married.

Gary, you ain't nobody, bro.

-Well, at least
I'm with one person, okay?

-No, now you with one person.

I remember back in the days,

you was a sinner
shaped in iniquity.

Mm-hmm.

We used to go up in the church,

"Hallelujah, hallelujah,
hallelujah,"

get our praise on just
for the attention, Gary.

Then we was in the club,
"Don't stop, get it, get it,"

spanking up,

spanking up some booties.

You was a little player, Gary.

You was a player, player.

I remember the first time
you seen Alice walk

across that stage.
-Don't go there with me, Freddy.

She had that big
Jennifer Lopez booty.

-Don't go there with me, Freddy.

Now you let my wife
rest in peace, okay?

You know nothing about her.

Last thing she needs
is people like you

trying to commentate
on how she passed.

-Look, man,
I'm sorry I brought it up.

-I told you,
don't go there, Freddy.

-I said I'm sorry
I brought it up, man.

-Freddy. Shut it up, Freddy.
-Saying you was a player, man.

-I told you not to do that.
-You was a player, Gary.

-Don't go there with me, Freddy.

Wow.

[ Chuckling ] Wow.

Wow, okay.

Alright.

I see you're a little sensitive.

It's all good.

It's all good.
My bad.

Wow, man, we've been friends
almost 20-something years.

I can't even joke with you.
It's all good.

So, uh...

when is Sheila coming home, man?

-Here she come now.

-Oh.

-Oh. Hey, baby.
-Hey, baby.

-How are you?
-Mm.

-Hey, hey, hey.
How you doing, Sheila?

-Oh, hey, Freddy.

How you doing?
-I'm good.

I was telling your husband
how proud I am of y'all.

You know, y'all got a great
marriage and everything.

-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

-Mm.

-How was work today, baby?

-It was fine, honey.

It was fine.

-Hey, uh, listen,
I got to roll out, uh, Gary.

I'm still going to see you
at the studio tonight, right?

-Yeah.

-About what time?

-9:00-ish
-[ Scoffs ]

-Oh, that's cool.
-Unreal.

-How you gonna bring it up
when she's standing there?

-Dude, I thought y'all had --
-I'm warning you, Freddy.

You pushing it.
-Don't -- No, don't...

-Oh, you pushing it.
-No, you pushing it.

-You -- I thought --
-Freddy...

you would work out going in
the studio with your wife, man.

-I want you to see your way
out the front door, bro.

That's about enough for today.
-You tripping, dawg.

-That's about enough for today.
-I'm finna pray for you.

-Pray for yourself.

-You standing in need
of prayer, bro.

-Pray for yourself
at the same time.

-No, you standing in
need of prayer.

[ Speaking gibberish ]

-Freddy!
-Mamas--

Please.

-Sheila, what was
that all about?

You just totally made me
look stupid in front of Freddy.

-Well, you just
basically said,

"Forget about my wife
who's standing there.

I don't have to ask her
if I can go out tonight."

-Sheila, do we have
to go there again, huh?

You know what I'm trying to do
with this new R&B album.

-Oh, the album.
The album, really?

-I swear, man.
-You know what, honey?

You've been talking
about this album forever.

Gary, we need some help
around here.

Why haven't I seen
your check from work?

Hello?

Tell me something.

-Uh...

-"Uh"?

-I invested in a new guitar
for the band.

-Oh, okay, you invested.

You invested.
You know what?

You really need to stop
with that fake terminology.

You're not investing
in the band, Gary.

You're wasting money on it.

Honey, come on.

Baby, I've been with you, what,
through thick and thin.

Okay, but for
the last six months,

it's like I'm paying
all of the bills around here

while you're too busy
playing rock star.

-Why can't you just
support me, huh?

-Support you?
-Yeah, support me.

Support you? How come you
can't support me, Gary?

I'm not asking
for the spotlight.

I just need a little bit
of your attention, baby.

That's all I want...

just a little bit of your time
and your attention

every now and then.

-Okay, I'm sorry.
Alright?

I will do better.
-Okay, yeah.

You've been saying
you'll do better

since the beginning of time.

I really don't know
what to believe anymore.

-Baby, we ain't been happy
in some time now, huh?

I mean, we ain't slept in
the same bed in over six months.

I know time is not
the real issue.

What's the real problem?

We used to go out.
We used to enjoy one another.

Something has changed, baby.

Something has changed.

What can I do to make things
right right here, right now?

What can I do
to make things better?

-I just need you
to hold me, okay?

Just hold me every now and then

or just -- just give me
some attention, baby.

I feel like I'm crying out.
You're not listening to me.

I'm crying out,
and you're not listening.

Is that too much to ask?

Is it?

[ Knocks on door ]

-Hello?

Hello?

Hello?
-Are we expecting company?

-It's your mother and father.
-That's my daddy and his wife,

and who told them
they could come over?

-Gary, it's your mother
and your father.

-It's my dad and my step-mama.
-Okay, okay.

-Hello?
-Hey, Ms. Lisa.

-Ooh, God is good, ain't he?

-Hey.
-Glory to God!

How you doing?
You look good.

-Alright.
-Y'all gonna be mad and stuff?

Uh-huh, he look mad.

Wh-What is all this, children?
-Ah, ah, ah, I'll do that.

-This young woman
ain't never learn

how to keep no house right,
Lord Jesus.

What's going on in --

Decorations all jacked
and everything, honey.

Why you keep following me?

I ain't fixing to steal nothing
in this raggedy house.

I mean, hey.

Wait a minute.
I got discernment.

I feel something right here.

-What?
-Let me...

-Honey, you got that lying,
lusting demon in you.

[ Indistinct shouting ]

Close that door!

She don't even go
to church on TV or nothing.

-Miss Lisa.
-Ha, hey, hey.

Jimmy, help me.
She ain't saved.

I'm trying to get her saved.

She just sitting over here
being fat.

Look at her,
got her little tight pants on.

Look at her.
-Y'all are talking crazy.

Look here, man,
the older I get,

the longer that ride
seems to get, man.

Dad, you stay around the corner.
-That thing ain't no corner.

That thing a whole piece
now, man, shoot.

-Did you walk or something?

-No, Lisa, she drove.

I'm just tired from watching her
jump curves and things.

-Ah, Jimmy, go and tell them
about your blessing, go.

-Oh, thank you, baby.
-Hey, son,

did I tell you
about my job offer?

-Job offer?
-Yeah.

-You are too old
to be working, Dad.

-Well, you know, we got one
on the way, so you know...

-Oh.
-...a little extra money

won't hurt nobody,
now, would it?

-Oh, my goodness, really?

-Sure, I got a mouth to feed.

-That's just nasty.
-I didn't say nothing

when y'all two hooked up
and did it.

-Dad, we're, uh, young.

-Look, man, I ain't too old.

I can get that thing
and drive it down like a hammer.

-I get it. Don't I get it?
-Dad, Dad, Dad!

Yeah, you get in that thing.
-Come on, Dad. Come on, bro.

-Well, I was just trying...

-You've only had
a couple years, please.

-I mean, son, look,
you have something for so --

for so long, you know,
you drive it so hard,

you'll tear that thing up.

-[ Giggles ]
-You know?

There's time for something...
There's time for something new.

There's time for something new,
you know, just...

What? Say...

Y'all look like y'all seen
some daggum ghost or something.

Say, "Hey,
want to take a picture?

Snap, snap."
-Are you finished?

That's enough, bro.
Please, Dad.

-Well, you know what, baby?

I think it's really sweet
y'all still got

all that fire
in your relationship.

It must be nice, huh?

-Fire?
-And desire.

I always did like that song.

-B-But wait.

I think y'all mind
in the daggum gutter, man.

We talking about getting
one of them Ford Geos.

-Ford Geos, Ford Geos.
-Oh, thank you, God.

-My buddy, Hank, went all
the way to Israel on 5 cents.

That's crazy gas mileage.

That's good gas mileage,
ain't it?

That is good.
-Hey, son,

how many miles can you
get to a gallon?

Probably go from here
to California on about,

what, $4 or $5 --
something like that?

That wouldn't get me
a lot of gas.

About $8 a gallon before Barack
got up in the office, wasn't it?

-Dad, what are you talking
about right now, huh?

-[ Sighs ]

Look, son.

Listen, son.

I'm just saying, I mean --
Look, yeah --

I mean, gas was pretty high,
I'm just saying.

-Okay, Gary, don't be
like that with your father.

Just let him talk, alright?
-Would you just tell him

to stop, okay?
-He doesn't have to stop.

No, she...
-My dad is an actor, okay?

Been an actor his entire life.

-You know what, Sheila?
Don't worry about it.

You know what?

Because see, son, one day,
you're going to look for me.

I'm going to be
already gone to a home,

sitting next to Jesus,
at the right hand of my father.

I feel something in my left leg,
right there.

-What is it?
-I can't hold it.

I see you, Jesus.

Hey.

Don't leave me.
Don't pass me by.

Hold me tight
in the midnight hour.

â™ª If anybody asks you â™ª

-Now that's my song right there.
-I'm going there.

â™ª Where I am going â™ª
-Where you going, Jimmy?

â™ª Where am I going â™ª

â™ª I'm going there â™ª

â™ª If I could take their pain â™ª
-Take it, Jimmy. Take it.

â™ª I'd run this way â™ª

I'm out! Pow, I'm out of there.
-Boy, you better run.

You better run.
-â™ª Until I see my savior â™ª

â™ª Face-to-face â™ª

â™ª Oh, oh â™ª

â™ª I'm going up that yonder â™ª

-Say what?

â™ª I'm going up that yonder â™ª
-Say what?

â™ª I'm going up that yonder â™ª

â™ª To be with my Lord â™ª

â™ª Whoa, oh, oh â™ª

â™ª I'm going up â™ª

[ Mumbling ]

-Say what?

-â™ª I'm going â™ª

-â™ª I'm going up â™ª
-What's wrong, Jimmy?

What's wrong?

-â™ª Ooh â™ª

-I think I'm dead.
-You're dead?

You dying right here
on the couch?

[ Sobbing ]

Y'all see?!
Is his spirit around?

Y'all just...

Oh, let's take a trip, yeah?

Don't nobody see what we...

â™ª Precious Lord â™ª

â™ª Take my â™ª

â™ª Take my hand â™ª

â™ª Come with me â™ª

[ Sobbing ]

Lord, Jimmy, get up now.

-What? Wait.
Wait a minute.

-Why is it so hot up in heaven?

-Dad, get up.
Get up, get up.

Come on, get up.
I told you.

-I thought I died for...
I thought I was dead.

I'm sorry.

I'm still here, though.

Thank you, Jesus.
-Where the baby at?

She didn't come
to the funeral!

-She wasn't there?
-She wasn't there, Jimmy.

I was crying and saying,
"She wasn't there."

I thought I seen her.
-Wait a minute,

What baby are you talking about?

Felicia.
-Alicia.

Her name is Alicia.
She's not a baby anymore.

She don't even know
the girl's name.

But, look, her head was this
big last time I saw her.

-It was smaller.
-No, Alicia is 16.

-Felicia is not no 16.

-Miss Lisa...

-Call me mama.
I married your dad.

We family now.
-Yeah, we together now.

-Miss Lisa...
you just seen her last week.

Okay?
-See, that's what wrong.

Families just don't visit
like they used to.

-No.
-A week is like 5 years.

I'm getting too old for that.
-It's too long.

-I got to see you everyday.

-Wait, wait. It's her.

-...that I'm ugly, girl.
She's just so jealous of me.

I can't stand...

Oh! They just get
on my nerves, girl.

Oh.

-Hold on.
Pinch me, Lisa.

I'm-a pinch you, too.
Well, we still...

We still alive, but...
-I'm alive.

But she walks by like we daggum
an invisibles or something.

-Invisible.
I ain't no invisible.

-You know what, Lisa?
-Huh?

-It ain't the kid's fault.

It's these no good parents,

ain't raising their kids right.

That's how the parents are
these days, ain't it?

-Well, excuse the hell
out of me.

-Now, son, is that
really called for?

-How you gonna
come up in my house

and, basically, tell us
we not good parents

and expect me not
to get upset, huh?

-Well, I tell you,
I'm going to die, boy.

Look here.
-Gary, baby.

All he trying to explain to --
-I didn't ask you, lady.

Boy, I tell you.
Boy, look here.

Woo!

Look, son, I might be
a small piece of leather...

-Small.

-...but I'm well put together.

-Look at them guns.
Look at them guns.

-Boy, I will slap you
so daggum hard, boy,

your eyelids are gonna
be talking in tongue,

talking about migity-migity-
migity mac daddy.

"I'm crazy."
I'm crazy.

-He crazy.
Look out.

-Okay, I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm sorry.

-I know you're sorry,
but daggum it.

What's wrong with this guy?
-Alicia.

-I don't know, baby.
-Alicia!

Come in here and say hello
to your grandfather

and your, uh...

step-grandmother.
-Hold on.

L-Let me call you back.
-Oh.

-Hello, everybody.

-"Hello, everybody."

Girl, we ain't
no daggum immigrants.

-I ain't Mexican.
-Come on.

Give your Gramps a hug.
Wait, wait, wait...

â™ª That rope, that rope,
That rope â™ª

â™ª That rope, that rope â™ª

â™ª That rope, that rope â™ª

â™ª That rope, that rope â™ª

â™ª That rope â™ª
Wait, I'm lost.

Where am I at?
-Where you at?

Got her.
-Oh, you gotta hook her.

You hooked her.
-You want some, too?

You want some, too?

â™ª That rope, that rope â™ª

â™ª That rope, that rope â™ª

â™ª That rope, that rope â™ª

Get her.

-You're just so pretty.
Look at you.

You're so pretty.
-Yeah.

What you about to do, girl, huh?
-I'm-a set the table.

Why don't you come help me?
-Okay, I'll come help you.

I'll watch her.
She lies.

I mean, hey.

Hey, praise the Lord.

Good.

-I tell you, man,
you know that child now,

she about that age,
man, you know?

Maybe need a little more
fatherly attention.

Don't you think?
Just a little bit more.

You know.
-Attention?

-Yeah.

-I know you just come up here
talking about attention.

You mean the kind of attention
that you gave me growing up?

You know what?

Maybe if you didn't spend
so much time chasing women,

like you apparently still are,
maybe you would have had

more time to spend with me
and my mom at the house.

-How about that?

-Gary, you almost died, son.

I almost turned around
and killed you.

You know that?

I thank God for Jesus, son.

I almost took your heart
out your chest right then.

I'm-a say it one
daggum time, Gary.

Lower you daggum voice.
Shoot.

-Well, Dad, don't
come in here

trying to tell me how
to raise my family,

seein' you never had time
to raise your own.

Why don't you save it?
-Oh, Gary, come on, man.

-Save it.
-Gary, just listen a bit.

-Save it, Dad.
-Gary, just listen.

-I don't want to hear it.

-Look, son, all I'm saying is

that you spend
so much time working, man.

If you don't start spending
no time with your family,

you may have
some problems, son.

[ Scoffs ]

You know, look, son.

I'm not talking about this
from some --

some stuff I read
from a comic book, son.

I learned it from
personal experience, man.

-Why are we still talking
about this, Dad?

I-I'm --

I'm just saying, son, I'm --

[ Sighs ] Look, son.
I know what I did was wrong.

I know I wasn't there
for you and your mama,

but, man, if I could
just rewind in time,

I sure enough would.
-Well, that's just it.

You can't rewind time.

And I know I ain't perfect,
but at least I'm here

for my family
when they need me the most.

-Look, son,
why don't you take a...

Ain't you going to
by that studio tonight?

Why don't you take her with you?
She like that music and stuff.

Why not spend some time
with her at studio?

She like that music stuff,
too, don't she?

Take her with you.

-Gary.

Gary, it's getting late, baby.

-Alright. Thank you.

I'm-a go on and get up
out of here and go

to my other job now, okay?

-Other job, huh?

With you and the band?

-Yeah.

We working on a new album.

-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

-You know, son,
you'll go a whole lot further

if you just did gospels.

That's what --
I tell him all the time.

-Dad, did I ask you
about my career?

Besides, I'm still
gonna do gospel, okay?

I'm just...
I'm just doing R&B to get to...

get to gospel
and my real passion.

There's no money
in gospel anyway, okay?

-Well, how much
you made in R&B so far?

-Get him, boy.

Multiple by zero, Jimmy.

What's that?
-That's still zero, ain't it?

-He ain't got no money in R&B.
-He still broke.

[ Laughter ]
-Oh, whoa.

[ Laughter stops ]
-[ Coughs ]

-That's not the point.
Alright?

I got to go, man.
-I didn't get to eat nothing.

She back there playing
with them Oodles of Noodles.

He ain't get to eat.
Just hungry.

-Don't worry about it, Lisa,
'cause, apparently,

we ain't wanted, either.

So we're gonna go on
over to the house.

We're gonna go --
[ Laughs ]

-Look at her. Look at her.
Look at Alicia.

Look at her head
on top of her body.

-It's just so pretty.

-Look at her.
She's scared of us.

Let's go, woman.

-You just look at her.

-â™ª That rope, that rope â™ª

And her cheeks,
tight and everything.

Just pretty.
-Bye, Gramps.

-Bye.
-Alright.

Y'all be good now.
-Bye, y'all.

-Uh, Daddy.
-Yes, baby?

You going already?

You only been here
about an hour.

-Baby, you want to be
a cheerleader, right?

-Whoever said I wanted
to be a cheerleader?

-Well, then, I gotta go make
this money so that you can be.

Okay?
-But, Daddy,

I thought we were going
to the movies tonight.

Whoever said I wanted
to be a cheerleader?

I want to be a musician
like you.

You know, a songwriter
and everything, like you.

-Listen, I want you to
go to college, okay?

I want you to be a doctor
or a lawyer or something.

-But --
-Life is no fun with no money.

-Daddy,
you used to always tell me

that it's about
enjoying the life

that God has blessed us with.

Right?

-Yeah.

I said that?
-Yes.

You and Mom would always
tell me that it was about --

-Alicia.
Hey, baby.

How's your little gospel
competition coming along?

It's coming along alright?
-It's going.

Hey, Daddy, you wanna hear
the song I been working on?

Let me show you.
-Baby, listen.

Listen, listen.
-I got the words.

I will listen to every single
song you've written tomorrow,

when I get you home
from school, okay?

Right now, I want you
to get your books.

I want you to go to class

and make
your old man proud, okay?

Okay?
-Okay, okay, Daddy.

-Okay.

I will see you two pretty ladies
a little bit later.

-[ Sighs ]

-[ Sighs ]
Bye, baby.

-Bye-bye.

-Little girl,

don't you ever disrespect
your father like that.

Do you understand me?
-[ Scoffs ]

-Your father works hard
to make sure you have

everything on your back,
do you understand?

-What are you talking about?

-Why would you
bring up your mother?

-Why wouldn't I?
She was my mother.

-Well, you know what that
does to your father.

-Well, only if you knew
what it did to me

to see you constantly hurt him.

-Hurt him?
Hurt him?

Little girl,
I'll have you to know

that I love your father
very much.

Do you understand me?
-Whatever, Sheila.

I'm not even gonna get
into it with you tonight.

-Oh, no, no, no, no.
Wait, hold up, hold up.

No, I want to hear
what you got to say.

-You know...

there's this scripture
in the Bible that says

what goes on in the dark
will be revealed in the light.

You ever read that scripture,
Sheila?

-Yes, Alicia.
I happen to know it very well.

So, what does that have
to do with me, honey?

-Why do you play so stupid
with everybody, huh?

You walk around here as if
you're this perfect person,

condemning everybody else,

when the truth is,
you ain't nothing but a che--

-Now you listen to me,
little girl.

I love your father very much,
and there is no way in hell

I'm-a let you or anybody else
separate that.

Do you understand me?

Now you know you're little
gospel competition costs

a little bit more
than your daddy can afford,

so you would want
to be nice to me.

That's what I thought.

Now if you don't mind,
it's getting a little late,

and I need to go to bed.

-[ Sobs softly ]

Everything has changed

since this woman has come
into my father's life.

â™ª Sometimes I feel
like you don't care â™ª

â™ª In times of trouble,
you're not there â™ª

â™ª But God is always there â™ª

â™ª By my side â™ª

â™ª You miss out on
my cries for help â™ª

â™ª You only think
about yourself â™ª

â™ª You've changed so much
over the years â™ª

â™ª You've changed in time â™ª

â™ª Don't you know
that you changed â™ª

â™ª You changed, you changed â™ª

â™ª But my God remains the same â™ª

â™ª I give it all to you â™ª

â™ª Because I know â™ª

â™ª Know that you will
fix it in time â™ª

â™ª You used to tell me
how beautiful I was â™ª

â™ª You showed how much
you loved me â™ª

â™ª But I wonder what happened â™ª

â™ª This time around â™ª

â™ª I wish that I could tell you â™ª

â™ª Without living
my life in regret â™ª

â™ª I wish that I could
express myself â™ª

â™ª But I'm afraid
it wouldn't help â™ª

â™ª So I'll just keep
my thoughts â™ª

â™ª My thought to myself â™ª

â™ª You changed, you changed â™ª

â™ª But my God remains the same â™ª

â™ª Oh, whoa, oh, oh â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª I wish I could just
go back in time â™ª

â™ª But I can't,
so I'll just â™ª

â™ª Live â™ª

â™ª Oh, whoa, oh-oh-oh â™ª

â™ª I â™ª

â™ª I'll just live â™ª

â™ª I'll just li-i-ive â™ª

â™ª I'll just live â™ª

â™ª I'll just li-i-ive â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I know that you
will fix it in time â™ª

â™ªâ™ª

-Oh, good morning, Alicia.
How you doing, baby?

-Better than you, I'm sure.
-Oh, come on, honey.

Can we just stop
all this hateration? Huh?

I mean, really, must we continue
on like this, honey?

-You know,
is it an educated issue,

or you really have
no understanding, do you?

You can't just cook a meal

and expect
for everything to be okay.

-Woo!

-Hey, hey.

How are my two favorite,
prettiest ladies

in the world doing?

Huh?

Baby, we finished
our third track tonight.

Tried to get the best of us,
but we got it done.

-Good.

-It's so hard
to lay tracks of music

with Freddy not being there
in the studio.

-Will somebody spare me, please?

Hey, Daddy.
-Yeah?

You know, the songwriting
competition is next month,

and I really want
to do a good job,

so I was wondering if you could
help me with the lyrics --

-Princess.
Listen, listen.

I will...
Just give me a second.

Let me get in for a minute.
I will definitely listen to it.

Okay? Give me --
Give me a minute, baby.

Let me relax.

-Gary?
-Yes, ma'am?

-You know what time it is?

-Yeah, I know.

Listen, we got carried away
last night.

-Uh-huh.

-But you know I got
to do it, baby.

You know my dreams.
-Yeah.

I know.
-My dream is to never

have to ride on the back
of a garbage truck again...

-Mm-hmm.

-...to not have to feel bad
about apologizing

for working all those
long night hours.

-Mm-hmm.

-My dream is to come
in this house,

sit on my throne,

order people around for us
just by saying a word.

Huh?
What you think about that, huh?

-I feel you, baby.
I really do.

But we need you here.

We do.

-I know. Listen...

Listen, Sheila, I know
I haven't been holding up

my end of the bargain
on our responsibilities, okay?

I know that.
Alright?

And I know that we should
spend more quality time,

but, baby, things
can only get better.

-[ Scoffs ]

-Believe it.

-Alright.
You know what, Gary?

You know what I've decided?
I'm not gonna get mad.

I am not gonna get mad anymore.
You know what?

If you feel like you want
to stay out all night long

to get your work done,
then you go ahead.

You go ahead.

I don't ever want to be
a hindrance to you

or to anything that you
feel like you have to do.

Trust me.

-Seriously?
-Mm-hmm.

-You gonna make me start
singing gospel again,

all this good news
you telling me.

-Well, now, you know
with the good news,

there's gonna be
some bad news, too.

-I don't want to hear
no bad news.

-Well...
-No bad news.

If I want to hear bad news,
I'll turn on the TV.

-[ Sighs ]

-Let me guess.
Let me guess.

Um, you can't make it
to the show Friday night,

is that it?
-No.

Gary, come on, you know
how I feel about those clubs.

I mean, it's just no place for
a good Christian woman to be.

-Come on, Sheila.

-What?

-Sheila, come on, baby.
We went through this.

We go through this all the time.

A club is simply a place
where people socialize.

-Man, Freddy can't come.
Now you too, huh?

-Would somebody spare me,
please?

-What'd you say?

-Uh, nothing, Daddy.

-I thought I heard you
say something.

What'd you say?

-Nothing.

Gary, let me talk
to you for a minute.

Listen, something
going on with Alicia.

I mean, I just don't get it.

It's like we're not
connecting anymore.

I just think you need
to talk to her.

-Oh, come on, baby.

-What? I'm --
-She's young.

You know how y'all women are

when you're young --
young and fresh.

-Gary, listen to me.
I'm serious.

You need to talk to her.

Alright?

-Okay. Alright.
Alright.

If that'll make you
feel better, alright.

-[ Sighs ] Okay.

Woo.
I'll see you later, baby.

You leaving?
-Yeah.

Bye, Alicia!

-[ Scoffs ]

-Alicia.

What's wrong with my girl, huh?
What's wrong?

-Nothing, Daddy.

I'm just doing my usual
rehearsal for the day.

Excuse me.

-Your usual rehearsal
for the day?

Is everything alright
in school?

You know, I ain't seen no
report card in a little while.

-Daddy, if I brought you
my report card,

would you even have time
to look at it,

or would you just glance over it
like you do everything else

and say, "Keep it up,
my little princess."

I find it so funny
that you always seem

to find time
to spend with Sheila

whenever she cries about how
much she wishes you were around,

but your very own
flesh and blood

just gets the crumbs
off the table.

-Alicia, don't talk about
your mother like that, okay?

-She is not my mother!

My mother is in Heaven.

You remember?

She passed away of cancer.

She was a real woman,

unlike that fake lady
that lives here.

-Alicia, I'm sorry,
but your mother

is no longer here
to take care of you, okay?

-[ Scoffs ] Daddy,
it's not like anybody's here

to take care of me
either, Daddy,

so what do you expect
for me to do?

Just sit up here
and constantly watch

how this woman really
doesn't love you

but still at the same time --
-You watch your mouth.

That's what you --

I don't know
what's gotten into you,

but this woman helps
with the bills.

-Some sense.

Some sense, Daddy.

That's what's gotten into me.

I mean, Daddy, why can't you
just open up your eyes

and see that this woman
really doesn't love you?

Daddy, you used
to take me to church.

Now you're not even concerned
whether I go or not.

Daddy, you used to read
the Bible with me.

Now you don't even read
the bible yourself.

That woman is
your first-class ticket

straight to Hell.
-Alicia!

Now, that is a good
Christian woman there, okay?

Now, just because I don't
go to church on Sundays,

you know why,
it's because I work.

I don't know why you acting
like you don't know that.

And it don't make
a person more spiritual

because you go to church
other than the next one, okay?

Now, you remember that,
Miss Self-Righteous.

-But you been spiritually
blind ever since you --

-Look!

Now, I don't know what the hell
has gotten into you,

but you will not
talk to your father

or your stepmother like that,
you understand me?

-[ Voice breaking ] I'm sorry,
Daddy, I was just trying to --

You were just going
to your room.

â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª Oh, oh â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª Searching for so long
to rectify my own lifestyle â™ª

â™ª But it seems that I,
I only make it worse â™ª

â™ª You said that
you would help me â™ª

â™ª Overcome all my life's fears â™ª

â™ª But it seems that I,
the less I feel you near â™ª

â™ª So I â™ª

â™ª So much more â™ª

â™ª I need to find a way
to find myself â™ª

â™ª Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª

â™ª So much more â™ª

â™ª I need to find a way
to find myself â™ª

â™ª My life has been â™ª

â™ª So upside down
ever since I walked away â™ª

â™ª Although I heard your voice
begging me to stay â™ª

â™ª It's been so hard
trying to keep my head â™ª

â™ª Above the river shore â™ª

â™ª In this life,
I know you want me to have â™ª

â™ª So much more â™ª

â™ª I need â™ª

â™ª I need to find a way
to find myself, oh â™ª

â™ª So much more â™ª

â™ª Lord, I need, yeah â™ª

â™ª I need to find a way
to find myself â™ª

â™ª You said that
you would help me â™ª

â™ª You said that
you would care for me â™ª

â™ª You said that you would
never forsake me â™ª

â™ª You said you would help â™ª

â™ª Said that you would give me â™ª

â™ª You said that you would
never forsake me â™ª

â™ª I need something
more than this â™ª

â™ª I need something
more than that â™ª

â™ª I need to find a way
to find myself â™ª

â™ª Lord, I need â™ª

â™ª Something more, yeah â™ª

â™ª I need to find a way
to find myself â™ª

â™ª Lord, I need â™ª

â™ª Lord, I need â™ª

â™ª Can you help me find
a way to find myself â™ª

-â™ª Baseball bat â™ª

â™ª How about a baseball bat â™ª

Daggum door ain't
never been locked

in the middle
of the daggum daytime.

â™ª Peanut butter jelly
with a baseball bat â™ª

â™ª Peanut butter jelly
with a baseball bat â™ª

â™ª Lord Jesus â™ª

Whoa.

Hey, man, you here.

I -- Sorry,

I wanted to come by
and fix this here door

as a little surprise for you.

This thing going to hang off
the daggum hinge the other day.

Son, do you realize that...

You realize it's boards in
the back of this house, son?

[ Mumbles ]

-It's what?

-There's boards back there.

I'm just wondering if you
knew there was, like,

people back there,
sets and things.

Look, here, son.
Where everybody at, man?

-Sheila is at work,

and Alicia's at school,
of course.

-And you sittin' here typical,
like a 21st-century man,

looking broke, busted,
and disgusted.

-Dad, don't start with me
right now, please.

-What you got to eat, man? Hmm?

-You don't know my situation,
so I would appreciate it

if you laid off the corny jokes
for a while, okay?

-I ain't say it was
typical of you.

I just said it was typical
of a 21st-century man.

-Okay. Whatever.
what do you want, Dad?

-[ Clears throat ]
Alright.

I really came by
to get something to eat,

but since you ain't got nothing,

I'll just eat this chicken
in my pocket I had from earlier.

Boy, it's...

Oh, boy.

Mm-hmm.

Hey, son.

What? You want some?

-No.
-It's fresh.

Look, son.

Why aren't you at work, man.
This ain't like you, man.

-Well, Dad, if you must know,
I got laid off.

It's only temporary, though.

-What, about two or three weeks,
something like that?

That's crazy, man, dadgum.

[ Quietly ]
Four to six months.

-Boy, I thought you said
four to six months.

Boy, I thought I --
I heard some stuff, boy.

-Four to six months, yeah.

-Yeah, but...

You fired, man.

Lookit...
That's the --

â™ª Jesus on the mainline â™ª

â™ª Tell him what you want -- â™ª

-Dad, please.
Please, come on, Dad.

I'm just saying,
you need a dadgum job.

Son, look.

How in the world...
I'm just asking a question.

Just...
It's a general question.

How in the world
do you get fired

from picking up dadgum trash?

I'm trying to analyze here.
I mean, maybe --

Were you pulling off too fast

before your partner
can jump on the back?

Look...

It take time, Gary,
for that man to get on the back.

Pick that garbage can up,
he says, "I'm ready to go."

You can't pull --
You can't pull off

too dadgum fast on 'em, Gary,
that's all I'm saying.

What happened?
Talk to me, son.

-They s--

They said I wasn't picking up
the trash fast enough.

-Gary...[ Sighs ]

that's worse.

Son, how fast...

...do you have
to pick up trash...

to keep your dadgum job?

Doggone it.

What...

[ Grumbles ]

Son, when --

when was the last time
you been to church?

Man, that's what you need,
some Jesus in your life.

Boy, I tell you.

-I don't know.

I'm -- I'm going --
I'm going Easter, though.

-Easter?
Easter, son?

Well, some of us got
to work, remember?

-Son, is everything
about work with you, man?

Wh-When do you spend time
with your family, huh?

-You know what,
like I said before, Dad,

you the last person need
to be talking about

spending time
with somebody family,

seeing you didn't spend no time
with your own.

-Look, son, that's really water
up under the dadgum bridge,

now, man.

Like, you walk around the house

with your cowboy boots
on all you want to,

complaining about,
"Well, spending time

with the family.

Look, son,
but every man needs some help

from time to time, son,

and right now is one
of them dadgum times.

Your life depends on it, man,

just as much
as your daughter do.

Now, look, man, I-I ain't
no genius or nothing like that,

but all I'm saying is this --

Alicia is really trying
to tell you a lot of stuff, son.

You might need to stop
and listen to her.

She trying to tell
a lot of information.

That's all I'm trying...
-What she trying to tell me?

Dad, what's she trying
to tell me, huh? What?

What's she trying
to tell me, huh?

-Well, son...

Well, son, she think
that just maybe --

just maybe now --
that Sheila might be

having an affair on you, son.

-Dad, I don't need to be
hearing this right now.

-Son, I don't blame you.

I -- It's hard to hear
the dadgum truth.

I know it is.
-I know the truth.

I know what you saying
ain't true, okay?

I swear, I feel like people
don't want to see me happy

no more, man.

-Gary, that ain't
true at all, man.

-No, it's like ever since
I messed up with Alice,

people just been holding it
over my head for the longest,

and I tell you,
I'm getting sick of it.

-Look, man.
You talking crazy, man.

-She would always tell me,
"If you could just get one job.

You don't work enough."

But she the same one who said,

"Whatever it is you want
to do in life, baby.

I'm right there for you."

-Son, you talking crazy, man.

Look, do you need some chicken
or -- or what you need, man?

'Cause you need something
to eat or something.

You talking crazy here.
[ Chuckles ]

Go on and get
a drumstick out, man.

Go ahead.

There's still some meat
on the bone.

-She found her satisfaction
elsewhere, Dad.

Son...

what is you talking about?

[ Chuckles ]

-Alice --

Alice found her satisfaction
in -- in drugs.

S-Say what, son?

-Sh-- She didn't die of cancer.

-Son...

I had no way of knowing.

I mean, y'all were
back in Atlanta.

-How could you?

You was always off
doing your thing.

You remember that, huh?

She found her satisfaction
in drugs...

the very thing she would
preach to our daughter about.

"Let's go to church.

We don't want to be late
for Sunday school."

This went on for 10 years
of our marriage.

I took her to church.

I took my daughter to church
every Sunday,

and Sunday school.

I wasn't one of these parents

that would just,
you know, send them.

I would get up with my daughter.
I would take her.

Next thing I know,
I'm not doing enough.

Then I'm doing too much.

And I just feel like
life is just --

it's just one big circle,
you know?

And it never stops,
and it never makes sense.

I don't even know what
to do right now, Dad.

W-Well, son...

it sound like that's
what your problem been

all the time, son.

-[ Sniffles ]

-Son, it sound like you been
doing it for everybody else,

but you forgot to do it for God
and for yourself.

Look, I'm gonna take a seat.

Look, man, when you try

to please
everybody else around you,

but forget to please God
and make sure that he's pleased,

man, ultimately, man,
you going to please nobody.

Look, man.

You know, let's talk
about this young man.

Let's talk about this young man.

This man was bright,

"edumacated," you know,

had a good J-O-B,

But he had a huge dream
and a huge vision, you know,

and folks became
so attracted to that man,

and I learned something
from watching him.

You know, you come across
one of three kind of peoples

in this here life.

One kind of folk,

they the kind of people
who they result-happy.

They cling to you, you know,
like a vine, and they --

they push into
the result so fast,

or they try to anyway,

and if it don't happen
as fast as they want it to,

then they'll turn
their backs on you.

But then you got some
other kind of folk.

These are --
These are the kind of people

who -- who -- who,
they do just enough --

they do just enough, son,
to stick close enough to you

so that just in case
you ever blow up

and that dream
ever come to pass,

they can jump on board,

you know, like the garbage man.

Jump on board like they been
there with you all the time.

But then -- but then, son --

but then, son, you got a few --
a few genuine peoples.

Just a couple of them --
a very rare breed of folk.

These the people who love you
just because you're you,

you know?

Man, these folks,
they put their blood,

sweat, and tears in all
your little projects, man.

Then won't ask you for a dime
when it's all over.

You understand what
I saying, son?

-Yeah, I think so.

-Son, listen.

Out of curiosity, son,
did you and, uh...

Did you and Sheila pray
before y'all two got married?

-Yeah. I mean...

of course we prayed.

-Son, I'm not talking about
at the ceremony, son.

I mean, did y'all two
really pray.

-I don't know, Dad.
I was excited.

You know, she was excited.

-Son, you can't marry somebody
out your emotions.

That don't last long
at all, son.

-I know, okay.

Alice had been dead for a year.

I was ready to move on.

-Look, son, you know that song
I used to sing for you?

â™ª A bird in the hand â™ª

â™ª Better than a thousand
in the bushes â™ª

â™ª Ooh, young Jesus â™ª

You still don't get the words
of that song, do you?

Look, the point of that
is like this --

You got a bird in the hand,
better than 1,000 in the bushes.

See, watch his.

Now, you got your one bird
in your hand.

That's Alicia.

Don't let go of that one bird

to reach down for all them
other birds out in the bushes

that fly away from you as soon
as you reach out for them.

Hold on to the ones
that love you right now, son.

Don't let her go.

You feel me, son?

-Yeah, I feel you, Dad.

-Well, that's what's up then.

What else you got planned
for the rest of the day, man?

Yeah.

-Well, I -- I, uh...
I got a job interview, so...

But, um...
-Oh, yeah?

I was --
I don't know.

You think I should
maybe cancel it

and spend some more time
with my family?

-Gary...

did your mother drop you
on your head, son,

when you was young?

I told her she need to be
more careful with you.

-Look here, son.

You see them lights up there?
You see them lights?

How them lights stay on, son?
Talk to me.

How them lights stay on?

-I -- You got to work.

Oh, wait.
So say it again?

-You got to work.

-Alright.
Now, what does work bring?

Work it out.
Process of elimination.

What does work bring?

-It bring --
It brings money.

-Okay, so you got to
work to get money.

Money what keep the lights on,
right? Alright.

So now, if you don't work,
what you want to do --

you want to eat, right?

You ever get hungry
every now and then, Gary?

Hmm?

Chicken, no chicken?

-I get it.
I get it, Dad.

-Look, son. If you don't work,
you don't eat, man.

-You don't eat.
I understand.

-Go to the dadgum job interview.
Get a job, son.

Duh.
Man...

That's an easy one, man.

You have a good one, son.
-Alright, Dad.

Phew.

Oh, Alice.

[ Chuckles ]

It seems like yesterday
we was just holding hands,

walking through the park.

â™ª You don't miss your water â™ª

â™ª Till your well runs dry â™ª

You remember that song?

I would come in
singing some R&B.

You would come in
singing some gospel

with your beautiful voice.

You sure were beautiful.

Everybody misses you, you know?

Gramps misses you.

You know I miss you.

If you could just show up
one more time,

it would make it so right.

[ Notes plucked on guitar ]

Your touch can make
the world brand-new again.

â™ª Together,
we can change the world â™ª

â™ª Helping every man,
boy, and girl â™ª

â™ª With a simple melody â™ª

â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª Together,
we can change the land â™ª

â™ª Help the spiritual
cripple to stand â™ª

â™ª And walk in destiny â™ª

â™ª Together,
we can see the rainbow â™ª

â™ª Have God's promises â™ª

â™ª Continue to glow â™ª

â™ª I can feel your hands
of mercy upon me â™ª

â™ª With you beside me â™ª

â™ª And I don't know
how I can make it â™ª

â™ª And I don't know
how I can take it â™ª

â™ª Without you in my life â™ª

-â™ª Me and you will make
a great team together â™ª

â™ª With the power of God â™ª

â™ª We could change the weather
in other's lives â™ª

â™ª From stormy days, through
the sunshine and the rain â™ª

â™ª Me and you would
be an influence forever â™ª

â™ª Now if I could just
hold your hand â™ª

â™ª Maybe I could understand â™ª

â™ª Why all good things
must come to an end â™ª

â™ª And I didn't know
how I could take it â™ª

â™ª And I didn't know
how I can make it â™ª

â™ª Without you in my life â™ª

â™ª Oh, oh-oh-oh â™ª

â™ª Yes â™ª

â™ª Yeah! â™ª

â™ª H-e-e-e â™ª

â™ª And I didn't know
how I could take it â™ª

â™ª And I didn't know
how I could make it â™ª

â™ª without you in my life â™ª

â™ª Whoa, oh-oh â™ª

â™ª Without you in my life â™ª

â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª Without you â™ª

â™ª Without you in my life â™ª

â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª I don't know if I can make it
without you in my life â™ª

â™ª Yeah, without yo-o-u â™ª

â™ª Without yo-o-ou â™ª

â™ª In my life â™ª

-Thank you for walking me home
from school today, Kenneth.

-But, Alicia,
I do that every day.

-Um...

Listen, why don't you
come inside for a while?

I mean, my dad's always working,

so I know he won't
be home for a while.

-Well, what about your mom?

-First of all, she's not my mom.

She's my step-mom.
She lives here.

-Okay, your "stepmom"

if that makes you
feel any better.

-Thank you.

Sheila is at work.

She won't be getting off
until about 6:00.

-And what does she do again?

-She's a guidance counselor.

Are you thirsty?

W-What kind of music
do you like?

-Let's see.

I have some...

BeyoncÃ©.

Oh, I got a little
"Rock the Boat,"

you know, that song
where Aaliyah is like...

â™ª Rock the boat â™ª

â™ª Rock the boat â™ª

â™ª Rock... â™ª

-Yeah, okay.

That's fine.

-Okay.

Well, Kenneth, you know,

you and have had so many
discussions on life,

you know, on family
and everything,

but I never hear you talk
about your mother and father.

You dress nice.

I mean, what do they
do for a living?

Well, my mom and dad left me
when I was only 2,

so my Uncle Freddy took me in.

He's my uncle,

but I call him my dad.

He's a lawyer.

And my mom --
or my aunt, rather --

she -- she left
when I was only 7.

-Oh. Why did she leave?

-Well, people say
she was unhappy.

And my dad admits
that it was all his fault.

He always said to me,
"Son, no matter what you do,

make sure you spend
more time with your lady

than with your boys."

-That's true because
your boys can't do for you

what a woman can.

-[ Chuckles ]

-Yeah, they most definitely
can't do everything a woman can.

-Yeah, I guess so,
but anyway...

-I'm kind of thirsty.
You have anything to drink?

-Yeah, we have some OJ
and some water.

-I'll take some OJ.

-You don't have
to take anything.

I'll give it to you.

-Baby girl...

you better stop playing.

[ Chuckles ]

That makes me feel
right at home, then.

-Do you want it with ice?

-I'll take it anyway
you want to give it to me.

-Wh-What you say?

-Nothing.
-Oh.

-Just that I'm really thirsty.

-Okay, well, I'll go ahead
and get that for you.

But I know how you feel about
that whole attention thing.

It's like, if you can't get it
from the ones you love,

then who can you get it from?

I mean, like, take my daddy.

My daddy is always working.

He's always trying
to buy me something

or trying to impress my stepmom.

But I miss my mama so, so much.

It's like I would give the world
just to have one moment

with my mama and daddy again.

It's like she had
this touch about her.

Like, every time
I would feel down,

she had this thing about her
where she could just touch you

and make you feel better,
you know?

She would always tell me,

"Never let a man tell you
what you can and cannot be."

She'd always quote
this one scripture

from Timothy 2: 4 and 12.

She'd say, "Let no one
despise your youth,

but be thou an example
to the believers in word,

in faith and...

in purity."

-How did she die?

-Well...

I guess I was kind of young
when it -- it happened,

but she had cancer.

I guess everybody thought
I was just too young

to really understand, you know?

-Man, that's real messed up.

-What you say?

-Nothing.

-You know what, Kenneth?

It feels really good
to just be able to talk

to somebody about your problems,
you know?

-Yeah, baby girl.

We can do all the talking
you want to.

-You know, I....

Sometimes, I wonder
what's the purpose in living.

It's like it's this
big rule book

that you have to live by,
and as a child,

you're told that
if you break the rules,

then you won't be successful,
but the funny thing is,

it seems like the ones
that are the most successful

are the ones
that break all the rules.

There is just so much
I don't understand about life.

[ Sighs ]

But...

I think I'm ready to break
one of the rules, Kenneth.

A-A-As crazy as it may seem,

I think I want you
to be my first.

[ Sultry funk music plays ]

-[ Chuckles ]

[ Music stops ]

-Oh.

-Help me.
-What?

-But, Alicia, I mean,

are you sure
you want to do this?

-I...

-This is something that
you can never get back.

-What is it?
Am -- Am I ugly?

D-D-Does my breath smell
or something?

What's --
What's the...

-No, that's not it.

-Well, let's stop talking
about it

and go through with it.

[ Sultry funk music resumes ]

-Oh.

[ Music stops ]

-But you not doing this
because you want to.

You just doing this out of pain.

You're trying to fill
an empty space

with an empty action,

and when it's all over,

you're just gonna feel worse.

You should wait until
it's worth something.

You don't have to be
like everyone else

for me to like you.

I like you because
you can't dance.

I like you for you.

â™ª You don't have to hurt
anymore â™ª

â™ª You can reach for the stars â™ª

â™ª In the sky above â™ª

â™ª So let no man â™ª

â™ª Stop you now â™ª

â™ª You've come too far â™ª

â™ª To live in doubt â™ª

â™ª He'll lead you
to your destiny, oh â™ª

â™ª You're my queen â™ª

â™ª You're my queen â™ª

â™ª You never have to try and be
something that you're not â™ª

â™ª Just stay true to yourself â™ª

â™ª God, he'll be your help â™ª

â™ª And lead you to your destiny â™ª

â™ª The tears,
you've had so many â™ª

â™ª You've cried yourself
to sleep â™ª

â™ª Thinking no one cares
about your suffering â™ª

â™ª When all your hope is gone â™ª

â™ª Find a brand-new song â™ª

â™ª It's a thing only
queens can see â™ª

â™ª You're a queen â™ª

â™ª You're a queen â™ª

â™ª You never have to try and be
something that you're not â™ª

â™ª Just stay true to yourself â™ª

â™ª God, he'll be your help â™ª

â™ª He'll lead you
to your destiny â™ª

â™ª You've sacrificed so much â™ª

â™ª Trying to taste
this sinless dream â™ª

â™ª I know sometimes it feels like
it's far beyond your reach â™ª

â™ª When all your hope is gone â™ª

â™ª Find a brand-new song â™ª

â™ª It's a thing only
queens can see, yeah â™ª

â™ª To truly get
the chance to shine â™ª

â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª

â™ª Oh, girl â™ª

â™ª Spread your wings
and fly, girl â™ª

â™ª Spread your wings and fly â™ª

â™ª Spread your wings
and fly, girl â™ª

â™ª 'Cause you're my queen â™ª

â™ª You're my queen â™ª

â™ª You never have to try and be
something that you're not â™ª

â™ª Stay true to yourself â™ª

â™ª God, he'll be your help â™ª

â™ª He'll lead you
to your destiny, yeah â™ª

â™ª You're my queen â™ª

â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª

â™ª Oh, hey â™ª

â™ª You just stay true
to yourself â™ª

â™ª God, he'll be your help â™ª

â™ª He'll lead you
to your destiny â™ª

â™ª Yeah â™ª

-Thank you, Kenneth.

Oh, Gramps...

Uh, how did you get in here?
-Shut up.

How did you get...

-Just shut it on up.

-How did you get a ke--
-I caught you red-handed.

Just shut up.

Thought I heard Michael Jackson
outside.

So what's your name, son?

-It's Kenneth.

-"It's Kenneth."

You don't got a fu--
a last name, son? Huh?

Trying to be smart?
What's your full name, son?

-It's Kenneth Woods.

-[ Chuckles ]

See, son...

I see what your wood do,
Kenneth Woods.

My question, well...
My granddaughter --

My question is,
what won't you do, dadgummit?

Hm? Now, I'm-a ask you
one more dadgum time

before I slap your end.

What's your full name, son?

It's Kenneth Woods, man.

I'm a get --
-Oh, hey, Dad? Daddy?

What -- What are you
doing home so early?

It's only 3:30.

-What's your name, son?
-Kenneth Woods, sir.

-Hold on.
Pause.

Now, why does he want to get
all nice and courteous

when he walks in dadgum house?

Hm? Y'all answer me.
Look, I'm...

But I'm the crazy one, though?

Un-pause.

-What you doing in my house?
-Uh, nothing.

-About to get your behind
to whoop, huh?

-And one of these stakes
is right there.

-Sir, I was just
walking her in the house.

-Ain't you Fred's boy?

-Yes, sir.

Wait -- Wait a minute.
-Well, I'll be...

-Gary, listen, Gary...
-Sit down.

-Fred's boy was about to be

your daughter's baby daddy, man,

right there on the plastic.

I seen it right with
my own two dadgum eyes.

-It's been a long time.
Boy, you growed up, huh?

Where's your father at?
I go by the house.

There's a sign on the door,
"We'll be back later."

-Yeah, well, he hasn't been
feeling too well lately.

-Hm.

-Yeah, there's a lot
of that going around, huh?

I try to call him.
He don't call me back.

You know, me and him used to...

Dad...

let the boy breathe, okay?

-Oh, I'm sorry.

Me and him used to chase
skirts and everything.

I, uh...
I've been looking for him.

-Ah, well,

too much hasn't changed
about that, either.

-Alicia, did you invite him
to the cookout on Saturday?

-Oh, yeah.
You should come.

My dad is, like,
the best cook in the world.

-Man, well, y'all...

Boy, y'all got some lying demons

in the dadgum house, boy.

That boy can't cook
dadgum toast.

-Dad, I think I hear
Lisa calling you.

-What? Say, I don't hear Lisa.

-Eh!
-What?

-Ehhh!
-Where Lisa?

I hear Lisa.
-Yeah!

-I hear her calling.
-Boy, you got some good ears.

-Eh!
-But, son,

I got something for you.

You think I'm crazy, don't you?
-Yeah.

Do -- Do you think I'm crazy?

Watch this here.

-[ Gasps ] Huh!
[ Sultry funk music plays ]

[ Music stops ]

-What grade you in, boy?

-I'm in the same grade
as Alicia -- 11th.

-Hm, you gonna graduate on time?

-Yes, sir.

-You know what, Kenneth?

You should never
try to be normal.

You understand what I'm saying?

Normal people,
they don't amount to nothing.

You know,
we just work day-to-day,

check-to-check,
hoping we got enough money

to save up
at the end of the month

to take our family out
for a Popsicle or something.

-[ Laughs ]

A Popsicle? Heh.

-That's funny, huh?

See, that's funny to you
because you probably

a little rich boy, huh?

I ain't mad, though.
That's a blessing.

But you just
keep it up in school,

so you never end up normal,
like me, alright?

You don't want that, do you?

You don't want that, do you?

-No.
-Do you?

Boy, I'm talking to you.
Is you deaf?

-No, sir.
I don't want to be like you.

-Okay. Uh, what --
what school you go to, bro?

I attend --
-Ah, Daddy...

would you please stop
badgering my guest?

-I'm just encouraging the boy.
-Come on, Ken.

-Listen, man.
Listen...

come on out to the cookout
on Saturday,

bring your father, alright?

Maybe you can get in contact
with him because I sure can't.

-Well, I'll see you Saturday,
Kenneth.

-I'll see you...
-[ Clears throat ]

-...Saturday, too, Alicia.

And be blessed, too.

And remember,
when the prices go up,

the blessings go down.

-[ Sighs ]

-Hey.
Hey, babe.

-This is Kenneth.
-I know you.

-Uh, yeah, I teach at
Magnolia High School.

-Uh, Kenneth.

-Yeah, nice to meet you.

-Hm.

Well, uh...
-Well, I best be going now.

-Okay, well, I'll see you
Saturday, Kenneth.

-Okay, Alicia.

[ Door closes ]

-What was that about?

-Seem like a pretty
nice boy, Alicia.

You like him?
-Ye--

Well, he seems pretty cool.

-Yeah, he seem like
he's alright.

That doggone Freddy, though.

-Ooh, Jesus.

Excuse me.

-Daddy, what are you
doing home so early?

I thought you had
to work late tonight.

-Well, baby, listen.

I've been doing some serious
thinking lately, you know?

I know I haven't always

been there for you,
like I should be.

I been so consumed
with what I'm doing.

I decided to maybe,
you know, take the day off,

spend some more time
with you and Sheila.

-Oh, her again?

[ Scoffs ]

-Alicia, do you have to
go there with me again?

-[ Scoffs ] Wow.

-[ Sighs ]

-Gary...
-Yes?

-What are you doing home?
-Well, I was...

-I thought you were gonna work
overtime or something.

-Well, I was just telling
Alicia, you know,

I, um...

I've been doing some
serious praying, you know,

and I -- I know that I haven't
been the best husband.

I haven't been the best father.

So I decided to take the day off
and spend some time with you.

-Oh, really?
Take a day off?

The way that the bills
are growing,

did you really think
that we can afford

to have you take a day off?

-Yeah, I felt the need to.

Listen, if I'm not careful,

my little girl will
be a grown woman,

and I won't have nothing
to do with it.

-Gary, you're gonna have
everything to do with it.

She's your daughter.

How do you provide
the clothes on her back?

You're there.

You make
all the sacrifices you can

for the little girl.

Baby, I...

You know what,
is this about the gospel money?

Is it? Is this about
the gospel competition money?

You know what?
Don't worry about it.

I already put the money up.

I knew you were
gonna ask for it.

I don't know if I like
the way you talking

about my daughter like that.

I know that.

-Well, do you know she talks
about me the same way?

Did you know that?

-Okay, listen. Come here.
Come here. Listen.

I don't want to argue
with you, okay?

I am off work today.

You are off work today.

Let's celebrate, baby.
Let's celebrate.

-Oh, God, Gary.
What are we gonna celebrate,

the 20th day of us
being home at the same time?

-Yeah, that's --
that's cool.

Baby, let's go out.
Let's go out.

Remember we used to dance, huh?

Huh?

Huh?
-[ Chuckles ] Gary.

Oh, snap.
You know what?

-Huh?
-I totally forgot, baby.

I --

I got to do some paperwork.

I told him I'd come back
and finish up

all of the filing
and everything.

I can't believe I forgot, baby.

You know what?
I'll be back early, I swear.

-So the day I get off, you --

you suddenly have
to be at the office?

-Gary, I'll be back.

I promise.

It'll be early.

-Okay.
-Love you, boo.

-Be safe.

-Bye, Gary.

-As I said before,
Ms. Washington,

um...

we're just trying to,
uh, close this case out.

Um, I feel bad about your son,

but there's nothing
I can do about it.

-What you said?

-Ms. Washington, I've said
this over and over again.

There's nothing we can do for...
-Did you? Okay, so anyways,

I don't know
what you talking about,

but I'm-a say what I got to say.

Look, I got three kids, okay?

And what I need you to do is
help me get my three kids back

because they just giving me
the runaround.

It makes me...
It gets on my nerves and stuff,

and I need you...

Okay, this is
the paper they gave me

the last time,
and they told me,

"You can get your kids back,
Ms. Washington.

You can get your kids back,"
and I said, "Well, that's cool,

'cause I'm Shaniqua
de Shaquan Washington,

and you don't play me
for no fool,"

so they said I can
get my kids back,

then they found that crack...
-Ms. Washington, Ms. Washington.

-...that one time.
-Ms. Washington,

you're rambling.

-I'm trying to tell you
my story about the crack

when they found it
and took my kids.

So, they found the crack.
They took my kids.

And, you know, that was dirty
when they took them

and, you know, little,
little de Shaquan was sticky,

but she was gonna be alright.

And, um, okay, so when
they found it and stuff,

and then I said, "I just
slipped up that one time,"

and then the lady was like,
"We don't really care,

'cause we gonna take your kids."
-Ms. Washington, please.

I got a few more clients
coming this afternoon.

-So, they more
important than me?

-I'm not saying that.
-What you trying to say?

-I'm saying we need
to tie this up,

and I will get
in contact with you,

or somebody from my office
will get in contact.

-You know what, every time
I come here to see you,

and I be trying
to have you help me,

you always give me
the runaround.

You always constantly
telling me stuff,

and you give me the runaround
about what you going to do,

and then you don't never evers

do nothing
that I need to happen.

Going on like you ain't never
seen a little bit of gnat

and some little lice
or something before.

You -- And you act like
you always been rich.

-Ms. Washington, please, uh...
I think we need to wrap this up.

Please?
Thank you so much.

Um, I will be in contact.

-So, what, you gonna
call security on me?

-If I have to, I will.
-You know what?

You real janky because
you can keep this, keep that,

and you ain't gonna never
gonna help me out,

do what I need to do,
and you just be showing me

attitude every time
I come in here,

and I'm done with you,
'cause you done forgot

what you done came from
with your roots,

and you know what?

For my inconvenience,
'cause you inconvenienced me.

Excuse you.
-Ooh.

-That's why I say, "A mind is
a terrible thing to waste."

Wow. Wow.
-Hey.

-Hey, baby.

-Hey.

-Mm.

-Hey.
-How you doing, baby?

-I'm good.
Look, I got your call.

I came over as soon as I could.

What's going on?
You sounded worried.

-I am.

Um...

We need to talk
about a few things.

-What'd you want to
talk about, baby?

-Um...

Let me just get right
to the point, baby.

We got to stop this.

We got to break it off.

-Freddy...

[ Laughs ]

Freddy...

come on, baby, mnm-mnm.

Not Mr. Don't-Stop
Get-it-Get-it.

Freddy, you know what,
you say that all the time,

and then what happens, huh?
-I know.

-We always end up right back
on top each other, don't we?

-I know, baby,
but this time, I'm serious.

We've got to stop this thing.
It's getting dangerous.

-[ Scoffs ]
Now, I understand

you ran into my son
the other day.

-Yeah.
He came over to the house.

I didn't know he and Alicia
were such good friends.

-That's what I'm talking about.

He's seen us together.

-Freddy, that's no big deal.

Baby, look,
I can make up something.

I can make it seem like, what?

We were just having
a business meeting, or...

It's no big deal.

-Wow.

-What?

-That's not the only reason
I think we need to break it off.

-Freddy, come on,
you losing me.

You know, I --
I think you been drinking

a little bit too much lately.

What's going on?

-I went to the doctor
the other day and I'm not...

I haven't been
feeling well lately.

-Well, that swine flu
going around now.

Well, what? Baby, come on.
It's probably nothing.

-Sheila,
can I ask you a question?

Do you...

Do you think God will
give me another chance?

-Freddy, what are you
talking about?

-You know, out of all the women
in the world I could've met,

I met you --

a married woman,

my best friend's wife.

It's like the cycle just goes
around and around, Sheila.

-Freddy, stop.
You're losing me.

Alright?

-Let me ask you
another question.

Do you think
God will forgive us?

Huh?
-Freddy...

-I was reading the Bible
the other day, Sheila.

-[ Scoffs ]
-Something I haven't done

in about 20 years.

And I came across
this scripture, uh...

Samuel 2:12,

and -- and -- and it talked
about this poor farmer,

who was out in the woods,
and he found a lamb,

and he took the little lamb in,

and -- and he fed the lamb,
and h-he gave the lamb water,

and he cleaned the lamb,
and he even let his --

his lamb sleep
with his children,

and he held the lamb in his arms
like it was one of his own.

And there was a -- a --
a -- a rich farmer

who lived not too far away
from the poor farmer,

and then a stranger
came to town one day,

and you know what
the rich farmer did?

He took that lamb,

and he sacrificed that lamb
from that poor farmer

and gave it to the stranger,

and God,
it said in the scriptures,

condemned that man,

the rich man.

Sheila, I am that man.

I am the man who turned you

against the one
who honestly loved you.

I am the man who turned you
into a hypocrite.

Look, stop talking
like that, Freddy.

You go into that church...

every Sunday,

and you put your mask on.

And you praise Jesus,
and you shout "Hallelujah"

to the preacher man
every Sunday, Sheila!

And you got that mask on like
nobody can see who you are,

and you keep that mask on
for a few pleasurable moments,

and then God takes that mask off

for the whole world to see.

Bad company...

corrupts good manners, Sheila.

Don't you see that?
-No, wh-wh-wh--

What does all of this mean,
Freddy?

What are you talking about?
-We -- we -- we -- we -- we --

We've been doing wrong so long,

you can't even see
what's right anymore, Sheila.

Think about it.
-Okay, fine.

You know, baby,
if you want to stop this,

we can just try and stop.
-No, we can't try!

We can't try.
We got to do it.

I kept...

I kept reading
that scripture, Sheila.

And it talked about
two deaths --

two deaths as I kept reading on.

And, you know, [chuckles]
I-I grew up in church, Sheila...

and I -- and I...

As I got older,
and I start becoming

more successful in my practice,

I start looking at all the lies
and all the deceit

and all the stuff
that went on in church,

and I lost -- I lost --
I lost favor with church.

I-I-I just got confused,

and I shut it all down,

and I stopped believing
in God, Sheila,

[voice breaking] and now
God is punishing me.

-God is not punishing you,
Freddy.

What are you talking about?

What are you talking about?

[ Sobbing ] Sheila...

I went to the doctor.

And the doctor told me...

God, I don't know
how to tell you.

-What is it, Freddy?

The doctor told me I had
full-blown AIDS, Sheila.

-Oh, God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my god, Freddy.

Freddy...
-[ Sobbing ]

-Oh, my god.

Oh, my God.

-Shh.

Oh, shh.
Be real quiet, Lisa.

Look, he's sleeping,

Okay?

Wh-- You --
-Shh, shh, shh.

-You walking too loud, Lisa.

Stop all that dadgum
stomping now.

Good thing we got
light feet, though.

And he smell like old
Pink moisturizer

or something.
-Yeah, he immersed.

He needs some of that 'tussin,

You know, the kind
you rub on like this?

I sure can't wait to
get my son some --

some -- get some good
old-fashioned ribs and things.

-Yeah, me, too.
-It's barbecue time.

It's barbecue time.

-What are you doing here
so early?

-Huh?

-Morning.
-It's 5:45.

Why y'all here right now?

-Well, look, son, I don't...

Y'all don't know how
to make no dadgum barbecue.

Can't wait till 10:00 a.m. to
get that grill good and ready.

You got to start early, mama,
at 5:45 in the morning.

Look, that way, get that
good old-fashioned grill,

put a little bit
of that gasoline --

just little bit of gasoline
in that thing --

-Yeah.
-...put that meat on top

of that grill, make one
of them good old-fashioned.

-[ Imitates sizzling ]
-That's the sound

you're looking for
right there, man.

That's it.

-Okay.
Whatever, man.

-What's wrong, precious?
You look a little stressed.

-Nothing, Ms. Lisa.
-Nothing?

-Nothing.
-You know what?

-I know what will get you right,

a mouthful of Grandma's
famous old coleslaw.

You see, I start off with
the cabbage and the carrot,

and then you put in a pineapple,
kiwi with the fur on it,

then cherries, bananas,
grapes, and onions.

Then you wrap it up
in a burrito,

put it on the grill, right?

When you put it on the grill --
Mm, this gum is good.

You want a piece?
Let me see if I got...

Never mind, but anyway,
then we take it off the grill.

After about five minutes,
you open it back up,

put a little moonshine.

My cousin Brita over
there at the corner,

she got some moonsh--
I mean --

Well, don't tell her I told you.
That's a secret.

Okay, so anyway,
you roll it back up,

dip it in Listerine, shut up,

put it in the freezer,
four seconds.

When you pull it out, lay it out
like a cinnamon roll,

and then you just cut it up
like that right there.

Ooh! Get you right.
-Okay.

-You might need a little extra
freshener for your restroom.

It -- It goes
straight through you.

But other than that,
it's good. Look.

-I'm still alive. Look at me.
-He's still alive. Look at him.

Look at him, just go on.

-Look, son, I'll tell you what.
-You're welcome.

-I tell you what,
go on and get your rest, son.

We'll be out back, go on,
get the grill ready,

for sure how we do it,
old-school way.

Alright, son.
Go and get some rest.

Alright?
-Oh, this is the first phase.

Burrito on the grill.

I'm-a be back with coleslaw
on the grill.

Burrito.

Hallelujah, burrito!

[ Door closes ]

-Sheila?

Where you been, baby?

I've been waiting up
all night for you.

I thought something
happened to you.

-Uh, I'm sorry, baby.
I just...

I fell asleep at the office.

Ah, you feel asleep
at the office again?

-Yeah.
-Listen, I keep telling you,

when you get tired,

pack up and leave early.

You -- you good?
-Yeah, I'm alright.

-Whew. I've been worried sick.
I slept on the couch.

-Let me get you
some -- some juice.

Have a seat, baby.

-Uh...
-Wow.

Whew.

Baby, you should have
seen the band last night,

boy, whew.

Like, our best performance ever.

I mean, everything
was incredible.

I'm talking about
the soloist was great.

The vocalist was great.

Don't feel bad about not
being able to make it, baby,

but I will tell you this --

We...

are on our way.

Freddy wasn't even there.

I mean, you know, the cat
that we rent the studio from,

the homey?
-Yeah.

He wasn't there
like we expected.

There's been a lot of rumors
about him lately.

-Yeah, so --

-I just hear my friends down
there talking about, you know?

-What you say?

-How was your solo last night?

-My solo...

You know what?
It was like...

It was like the first time
when I picked up the instrument.

It was like the first time
I ever played.

I mean, I can...

It was like this angel
was sitting on my shoulder

singing and humming

and telling me
every note to play.

It was actually pretty amazing.

It was --

It was a special night.

-That's great.

Gary...

I got something
I need to tell you.

-Really?
-Yeah.

-Okay. Well, I got something
I need to tell you, as well.

-Okay.
Well, you go first.

-Okay.
Well, Alicia...

You know, she's been worried

this songwriter's
competition,

and, you know,
she's been bugging me about it,

so she decided to submit
one of her works early

just to kind of,
you know, test it out,

and, baby...

I didn't know my daughter
was this talented!

I mean, I'm listening
to her song.

It is blowing me away.
I'm talking about...

The song is talking
about integrity

and --and -- and honor,

pointing it all back to Christ.

-Yeah.

-I'm thinking to myself,
"I better start taking time

and listening to her music
before she become famous!"

So, anyway,
she submitted the song

to the cast
and director yesterday.

Of course, he was surprised
that, you know,

she submitted it kind of early,
and when he listened to it,

it automatically made her
a finalist.

-Wow.
-Yeah!

He says, "Listen. You submit
one more song like that,

he's gonna introduce
her to some people

that can help her get
in the music business."

-Wow.

-Ain't that great, baby?

-Yeah!

It is a blessing, baby.

-Sheila, what's wrong?

Let me guess.

We don't have the money

to submit the rest
of our material, right?

-No! No, it's not that.

It's not about the money, Gary!

-Well, what is it then?

Gary, I...

[ Sighs ]

You're a good man, baby.

You're such a good man.
-Well, thank you.

-I mean, I think
you're an amazing man,

and I think you just have
this extraordinary vision.

I just don't feel
like I could just...

-There's my little princess now!

-Good morning, everybody.

-I was just telling your stepmom
how proud of you I am.

-Oh, really?
-Yes!

-I'm sorry, baby.

What were you telling me...
gonna tell me?

-I'll tell you later.
-No, you don't have to wait!

No, Gary!
I'll just tell you later!

-Daddy!

-Daddy...
-Yeah.

-What time do you want me
to tell Kenneth to come over?

-Um, just tell them they can
come over about 8:00 a.m.

You know, the earliest,
the better --

the earlier, the better,
'cause I'm going to be here

fellowshipping
and preparing all the food

and making sure
all the food is ready.

Listen to me.

Your mother would be
so proud of you.

I'm proud of you.

Everybody is so proud of you.

-Daddy...
[ Both chuckle ]

I'm so glad that
you're happy and everything.

-Yes, I am!

-But s-sometimes, I wonder
what life would be like

if mom was still here,
you know?

-Hmm.

You know what, baby girl?

I sometimes wonder
the same thing.

-You know, she was my refuge.
-Mm.

-It was like,
I could tell her anything,

and she would honestly try
to understand me, you know?

-Yeah.

-She did have a way of helping
you understand life, huh?

-Like nobody else.

Daddy, these past four years
have been really hard for me

since she's been gone,
and -- and I...

Of course, I never wanted
to bring it up in your presence

'cause I knew it
had to be painful

for you to lose her,
you know?

-Yeah, it was.

-She could sing
like nobody's business, Daddy!

[ Laughs ]
-She could.

-She would always tell me
to keep my journal

because life is one big circle,
and -- and if you mess up,

you can record
what you did wrong

and make it better
the next time.

-That sounds like her.
-She said,

"That's what makes
a good songwriter

or a preacher or a teacher,
or whatever else holds

a great amount
of responsibility."

-She's right.
-When you can go

through something without
allowing it to kill you,

just write it down
and help someone else live.

-Yeah.

-Daddy, do you
believe in angels?

-You know what, princess?
I, um...

I think I'm starting to!

[ Chuckles ]

Alicia, I know that, uh...

I haven't been
always there for you.

I've been so wrapped up
in -- in -- in --

doing my thing that I never
thought about you doing yours,

and for that,

I want you to know
that I'm sorry.

-Daddy, don't feel bad

'cause I know I haven't
been acting right either.

I have something very important
I need to tell you, Daddy.

-Why does everybody got
something important

to tell me right about now?

-It's about Sheila...

-Okay.

-...and Mr. Freddy.

-Okay.
What's wrong?

-[ Sighs ]
-Well -- Well --

You know, Kenneth and I are
really good friends, right?

-Uh-huh.

-I've seen Mr. Freddy
here one night

while you were at his studio.

-What are you trying to say
to me, Alicia?

-Oop! Belisha!

Put the fire out, baby!

Put the fire out!

Man, they don't make grills like
they used to make them, man.

Look...

we put a little more gasoline
in that doggone thing.

We done blown it up and stuff.

-What?
-Don't worry about it!

Lisa, she out back
fanning the fire.

-I'm-a go by the bathroom.
What's wrong?

What --
I'm going...

She a fire marshal, man!
Chill out!

I'm-a go by the bathroom.
My bladder about to fall --

Gramps! Gramps.

I told him.

-Told who?
What'd you tell him?

-My daddy!

-What'd you tell him, Alicia?

-I-I told him about
the late-night creeps...

-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-...and the man coming over here

to spend time with Sheila.
-Whoa, whoa, shut up!

What'd he say?

Talk, honey.
Talk.

He -- He didn't say anything.

-Nothing?

-Well, I didn't quite get
to the "late-night creeps" part.

I-I tried to tell him,
but I got distracted.

-What could be that
doggone distracting

to where you couldn't tell...

This may be a little bit
above your league, okay?

Maybe a little bit
too big for you.

-I don't know why, Gramps!

I'm telling you,
that lady is mean!

-But I'm not saying that you --

that you ain't
telling the truth.

All I'm saying is,
my bladder is 88 years old.

I got to go
to the doggone bathroom.

Talk to me about this
in a minute.

Doggone!

-[ Sighs ]

-Still working on your
little music, huh?

-Yes.

I'm only so far from winning
this competition,

and I'll pay you back
everything I owe you.

-What you owe me?

Little girl, you can't
hardly pay me back

what you owe me for everything
I've done around here!

-Yes, I will,

since you feel
like I'm such a burden.

-"Burden" ain't the word.

-Let me ask you a question,
Ms. Alicia.

You believe in God?

-Yes. Why wouldn't I
believe in God?

-Well, if there really is a God,

why He let good people die, huh?

I mean, if there
really is a God,

then why won't He stop
the spread of corruption, huh?

It's like you spend all
your life trying to be somebody,

and then, ultimately,
you just end up nowhere.

Then along come little,
good people like you

talking about how God is
and how good God is.

Well, you know,
if your God was so good...

How you know?

You ain't even lived yet,
little girl.

Sheila, I know you feel like
your life is falling apart,

but that's not a reason
to blame God, ugh.

Little girl,
just sit over there

and write your little
innocent music,

and maybe after you've gone
through something,

you can tell me
about my problems.

You understand?

[ Chuckles ]

You know I met your daddy
in church?

Mm-hmm.

He was wearing this white shirt,

this red tie,

and he had on these little
brown khakis.

He was quite a gentleman,

but I just knew
something wasn't right.

Oh, he was still in love
with Ms. Alice.

Never quite got over Ms. Alice.

You know, I met your mama
before she died.

People still tryin'
to cover up the fact

that woman died
from a drug overdose.

Don't nobody want to
say nothing, though!

-You don't know
what you talking about!

The hell I don't!

-I don't want to hear this,
you liar!

-Why the hell would I lie?

Why would I lie, little girl?

Sit down.

You know what, Alicia?

When I look at you,
it's like --

it's like I can see myself
in you or something.

You remind me so much of me.

[ Chuckles ]

You know, my daddy
was one of them

big-time preachers
at a church in Atlanta.

[ Sighs ]

He used to --

He used to make sure that
I was there all the time.

I used to play my little music.

I used to sing in the choir.

I was even giving piano lessons.

He made us go to church
every single Sunday,

and then he made us feel like,

"Well, if we didn't go
to church this Sunday,

then we were sinners."

He made it seem like those
little four red brick walls,

that was our only way
to ever become somebody.

It was the only way into heaven!

Everything was fine, too.

One day I walk in.

I walked into
the pastor's study.

And there my daddy is...

on top of one of
the church members.

And instead of him saying,
"I'm sorry, baby!

I'm sorry, baby,"

he never even addressed it.

He just kept going
Sunday after Sunday,

as if nothing ever happened.

So, you know what?

I just learn to do
what I've seen.

Okay?

If that means playing church,

then hey...
[ Glass thuds ]

...I'm just a product
of my society.

You know,
your mama played church?

Oh, yeah.

Your daddy --
he about to jump

right back in the game, too.

So, you know,
your life is young, honey.

You need to enjoy it
while you can.

-[ Sniffles ]

[ Sobbing ] Everybody is
not like your daddy!

That's why I don't care
about this one!

Alicia!

-[ Sobbing ]

What's your problem, child?

-Gramps!
Why didn't you tell me, Gramps?

-Look, I-I heard what she said.
-How could you --

How could you hold
the truth from me

when you know my momma
was my very reason for living?

-Alicia, that's not
what's important right now.

-What's not important?

What's not important?

-What you're going through.

-It has no real importance
right now

You could use
your same music and stuff.

I mean, all the...

People always got
something negative to say

when you try to do something
positive with your life,

but what you have
to learn how to do is,

know who you are inside.

Think above everybody else's
negative comments and things.

Put it like this --
Fly up in sky.

Fly in the sky, yeah.

Come on.
Pick your stuff up, man.

â™ª Life can be so strange
with this twist and this turn â™ª

â™ª And people can appear to
be mean at various times â™ª

â™ª So, you try to compress
your feelings inside â™ª

â™ª 'Cause it hurt and made you
ball up in your mind â™ª

â™ª But fly in the sky,
where no one can hinder you â™ª

â™ª In the sky, where nobody
can discourage you â™ª

â™ª In the sky,
where your greatest dreams â™ª

â™ª They come true â™ª

â™ª In the sky â™ª

â™ª Hey, hey, hey â™ª

â™ª In the sky â™ª

Come on.

Just try it out, you know?

Alicia...

it's gonna be alright.

â™ª They will conform to the ways
of this, of this world â™ª

â™ª They attempt to get you
to go along â™ª

â™ª with their schemes
and their, their plots â™ª

â™ª They misconstrue
the Word of God to â™ª

â™ª To, to, uh, justify â™ª

â™ª But just stay firm
in the faith â™ª

â™ª Keep your eyes on the prize â™ª

â™ª Fly in the sky,
where nobody can hinder you â™ª

â™ª In the sky, where nobody
can discourage you â™ª

â™ª In the sky,
where your greatest dreams â™ª

â™ª They come true,
in the sky â™ª

â™ª Oh! â™ª

â™ª In the sky â™ª

Pick your stuff up! Come on.
Pick your stuff up and yell!

â™ª You gotta believe
in your dreams â™ª

â™ª Yes, you do, yes, you best
believe in your dreams â™ª

â™ª But you got to believe â™ª

Yeah, believe
in your dreams!

Pick up this dream, girl!
Pick it up! Uh-huh, yeah.

â™ª Believe in your dreams â™ª

â™ª You got to keep on
pushing forward â™ª

â™ª Pushing forward, yeah â™ª

You know what I'm talking about?

â™ª Keep on believing
in your dreams â™ª

[ Vocalizing ]

â™ª Believe in your dreams â™ª

Walk with me!
Come on, baby!

â™ª You can move
around the world â™ª

â™ª But you must believe
in your dreams, girl â™ª

â™ª Believe in your dreams, girl â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

"Walk by faith
and not by sight."

Look at that!

â™ª Believe in your dreams, yeah â™ª

-Hey, d-d-did your dad say
what time he was...

would be home?

-I hadn't heard from him.
I don't know.

-You haven't seen him?
-I haven't seen him.

-What about, uh...
your grandfather?

Nobody's here?
-Sheila!

-[ Sighs ]

-Sheila!

-Hey, Gary.

Let me just say something
to you, bro.

Please.

-Hey!
-Daddy!

-I just got a phone call!

I just got a phone call
from your people at the office.

Where were you last night?

Where were you last night?
-Gary -- Gary --

Gary, I was at the office.

-That's not what I heard,
Sheila!

-Gary! Gary!

[ Indistinct shouting ]

-Oh, my God.

-[ Groaning ]

-I tried to be there
for you, Sheila.

-Gary, please,
just listen to me.

-I I was just trying to be
the man you wanted me to be.

-Gary, please...

-Alicia, I'm sorry.

You've been trying to tell me,
and I didn't listen, and I --

I apologize, Alicia.

-[ Voice breaking ]
It's okay, Dad.

-Gary, please.
Come on.

Just let me explain.
-Get your stuff and get out!

Okay, Gary, please,
just let me explain.

Get your stuff and get out!
-[ Screams ]

Lord, I don't know why
You make us the way that You do.

Sometimes, I feel like
You made a mistake with me.

Life goes by so fast,
and I wasn't ready for it.

I-I guess it is true
when they say,

"What goes around,
comes around," huh?

I just wasn't ready, Lord.

What do I make of myself now?

Where do I go from here?

-You go on.

You keep living your life.

You know, there are
many generational curses

that have hindered this family
for a long time,

and I couldn't
take it any longer,

and that's why I left.

This cycle will continue

until someone breaks the curse.

Gary, I know that
you try to do your best...

but you cannot allow Alicia

to grow up
not knowing our mistakes.

I don't know why that's such
a major issue with parents.

We just don't want to tell
our children the truth,

but how can we expect
for them to grow up

and be better people
if we never share with them

the mistakes that we made

and the things
that we went through?

[ Sighs ]

Life is short,

and you're only here
for a short amount of time.

You know,
the most important question

that any person can
ask himself is...

"Where will I go

when the lights go out?

Will my soul find rest
beyond the river's shore?

Where will my soul be?"

It's either Heaven or Hell.

Gary...

I know that you try to do
what's right,

and that's good,

but even I learned that
if you try to do what's right

without first asking God
to show you,

you can find yourself
deeper in quicksand

than when you started.

[ Sighs ]

But God...

God -- God can reach down
into that quicksand

and pull you out

without leaving
a grain of sand on you.

-So, what do I do?

-Just do like I did...

and say...

"Father, I'm sorry."

-Father, I'm sorry.

-"Please forgive me."

-Please forgive me.

-"Make me over."

-Make me over.

-Make me over.

"I've put some things
before You, dear God."

-I have put some things
before You, O God.

-"I've put some things
before You, dear God,

but now I put You back
as the head."

-But now I put You back
as the head.

-"And now, I put
You back as the head.

-You are my Savior."

-You are my Savior.

-You are my Savior.

-"Now and forevermore."

-Now and forevermore.

-Now and forevermore.

-"Even after my lights go out."

I'm finally finished.

Now I understand

the importance of trusting You.

I thought You left me,

but now I see that You were only
giving me room to grow.

Pain and suffering

and persecution,

that's what brought
about triumph

in my everyday life,
as well as in the competition.

Now I know that if I never
would have went through

what sometimes appears to be
hard times and dark times,

I never would know how
to appreciate the light.

[ Sighs ]

â™ª I can see miracles â™ª

â™ª Flowing through me â™ª

â™ª I can see healing â™ª

â™ª Coming to my family â™ª

â™ª Lord, You gave me
the eyes of Yours â™ª

â™ª So I could see how to love â™ª

â™ª You gave me
the eyes of Yours â™ª

â™ª So I could lay out
in integrity, oh â™ª

â™ª Now I'm letting
go of my pain â™ª

â™ª In You,
I have so much to gain â™ª

â™ª Because of You, O God â™ª

â™ª O God, O God, O God â™ª

â™ª My life will never
be the same â™ª

â™ª You deserve all
the honor and praise â™ª

â™ª You mended my heart â™ª

â™ª So I could give
you all of me â™ª

â™ª I lift up holy hands â™ª

â™ª I give all my praise
