human beings closest encounter before death

I lie in the Coffin

whilst rites are being performed

but I am not dead

this is a Thai custom

to bluff the god of death

to dispel bad fortunes

difficult for lots of people to believe

but I believe

and not only me alone

today,in a thai province,thousands gather for a strange ceremony

to lie in a coffin to rid one of bad fortunes

bullshit

After the coffin ceremony

I can feel the bad luck

leaving mine body

when I leave the coffin

I feel that life has a new meaning

My daughter was in coma

I wrote her name on paper and prayed in the coffin with it

She woke after a week even doctors call it a miracle

my mother had stomach cancer

we tried all types of cure to no avail

that is why I brought her here

she will become better after it

tens of thousands attend it over the 3 days

making it the world's biggest live burial and Guiness record

when are you coming back to Hong Kong

everybody is in a panic about it

cannot have a wedding without a bride

Unusual happenings with their coffin ceremony

I am not an expert

Every one have his curiousity

why did he die

this was taken less than 1 hour before his drowning

we went for excursion after our graduation

we raced to see who could reach the shore first

trying to impress the girls

he was chasing after me

suddenly he disappeared

at Joe's funeral ceremony

only his mother did not shed a tear

after his cremation

she told us the real reason

I cause the death of my son

I had stomach cancer

but I never mentioned to anyone

I don't want him to worry

the doctor said it was terminal

 it was terminal and I don't have long to live

later,someone told me about the coffin ceremony

I don't belief in these things

but then I thought, why not?

that is when I went to the ceremony

when death is right in front of you

you try to evade it

after the coffin ceremony

I did not feel any difference

but the doctor told me

my stomach cancer is gone

how do you explain

this and Joe's death

is there a relationship to it?

because on the day of Joe's death

the doctor told me this news

that my cancer is gone

do you know?

you cannot escape retribution and bad luck

you can only pass it on to your loved ones

auntie, are you better?

did you see it?

see what?

just a while ago..

honey!

honey!

my honey!

give me child back to me!

give my child back to me!

are you alright?

any connection to what is happening now?

I have collected a lot of information

recording what has really happened

Surachai....43 years old

colon cancer, went to the coffin ceremony

on 17 July 2004

was cured 1 week later

would have died if nothing miraculous occured

Suhontha,67 years old

went to coffin ceremony 27 April 2001

few days later, heart problem improved

but at the same time, grand daughter seriously injured

anybody encountered supernatural happening?

only one!

happened 5 years ago

but I cannot reveal too much about this case

unless someone has experienced it before

why did you go into forbidden area?

I saw a woman entering the area

No woman in the temple

only female ghost!

why do you look so pale?

nothing

how long have you been a grave caretaker

even before you were born!

taking care of the dead

makes me treasure my life

how many bodies have you cremated?

3248 including the one inside

did you cremated a woman and child recently?

I have booked tomorrow's ticket for you

thank you

remember our school days?

I dried your hair

sleep in the same room

eat instant noodles together

wear the same clothes

play truant together

fall for the same guy

sorry, talked too much

never mind

what I meant was

my dad died of liver cancer

I don't want to die the same way

I eat proper meals

took care of my health

I exercise everyday

follow the rules of good health

you are very well now

right but not Jack

Jack is dead

he died because of me

don't say that

I was thinking when I lie inside the coffin

why is it not Jack

he smokes everyday

why is it not Jack

it is not fair

I am sorry to hiim

what do you want from me?

what do you really want?

what do you want me to do?

I want to go and see Ah Chan again

please

Chris!

I cremated alot of bodies

never met with anything unusual

none we could not burn

if there is a preparation problem

like the burial door that is stuck

or the burner could not lit

or the coffin keep shifting

then we bury them here

they should be waiting for you

Chris?

Chris?

Chris?

No!!! Chris?

Chris?

Chris?

Chris?

Chris?

No!

Mariko?

Mariko!

Mariko?

You lie in the coffin once more

death is not death, it is actually life

death before dying 

sawaadee khrap

how are you, Chris?

I am well

This is Nan

Sawaadee Khar

She is Sue

Ah Chan told me about your problems

my condolences

Chris, why is this happening?

Life keeps revolving nonstop

but was broken by us

how to resolve it

I haven't done anything

the night I found May's body

Mariko fell into coma

she's been in coma since 

she died 5 years ago

sorry, I did not know about it

it's all right

both my parents died when I was young

thinking of my loved ones leaving me

makes me feel more terrible than being dead myself

apologies

I could not help you much

you have been a great help

I am sorry, May

If I had known I will harm the both of you

I would not have joined the coffin ceremony

It's not Mariko's fault

he could have been a good man

when I got home

the house was on fire

I wanted to save him

but I failed to do so

you left me because of him?

If he is your child

I would have stayed behind

I am sorry

Chris....

I missed you

the same with me

I have to leave

will we meet again?

My cancer has returned

After the second coffin ceremony, my cancer returned

and I did not see Jack again

I have been under therapy for some time now

it has been unbearable

but life keeps revolving

I will not try to stop it again

Do I look like your bridegroom?
