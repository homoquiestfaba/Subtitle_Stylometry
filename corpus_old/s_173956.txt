I don't have custody of the kids.
Yeah.

You know what?
I don't get custody.

It is an insane pathetic joke,
what I've had to go through.

Right now, right now she doesn't know
where the kids are, do you?

Do not taIk about me as a mother.
Are they at home?

I'm so sick to death of you taIking about
me as a mother

and what I've done wrong!
They at your sister's? Where--

they're probabIy at a firehouse
somewhere. She'd just drop 'em off

with a fireman, you know?
Do not taIk about that!

I am sick of you accusing me
of not being a good mother!

Are they at home? Are they at home?
Seven years I've been a good mother!

A perfect mother?
I can't have custody.

Just remember when we went out.
Just remember how you--

Right now. Where is Tim
right fucking now?

Don't you taIk about me
being a mother. I hate you!

Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't you just kiss my Ieft nut?

I toId you this was a bad idea.
You know what, Ken?

A bad idea wouId be to Iet your cIient
waIk outta here today and drag

this thing out for another year, wasting
more time and wasting more money.

The onIy good idea is to Iet
me and John do our job

and mediate this thing right here.
You wanna hear the crazy thing?

I know it doesn't feeI Iike it,
but we're making progress.

Mm-hmm.
We settIed the deaI with the cars.

Let's see, that takes us
to frequent fIyer miIes. We're fIying!

Those are mine.
I want them.

You know what we're gonna do? We're
gonna spIit 'em right down the middIe.

How'd that be, Mr. Kroeger?
It wouId be no-not good at aII!

I earned those miIes!
Yeah, you earned them fIying

to Denver to meet your whore.
Oh, Lord.

WeII, she's not afraid
to express herseIf sexuaIIy

if that's what you mean.
She's a stripper, for God's sake!

She is not!
Her name is Chastity!

She is white trash!
Same as you.

HiIIbiIIy!

That's it,
go comatose for me, baby.

You shut your mouth when
you're taIkin' to me!

HoId it. This is getting confusing.

You didn't aIways hate each other.

There had to be some nice moments,
during the courtship, maybe?

Or the wedding?
The wedding had to be fun!

You have your famiIies together.
You have your decorations.

FamiIies coming together.
That's a nice moment.

What'd you have to eat?
Crab cakes.

Are you kidding me? Crab c--
how couId you not have a good time

eating crab cakes? I Iove 'em.
Crab cakes, I Iove crab cakes.

They're phenomenaI.
And did you have a band?

Did you have a band? Good or bad?
Yeah.

Who gives a shit? It's a great band,
it's a bad band, it's Iike pizza, baby.

It's good no matter what.
That's true. You got them...

There's music in the air!
...pIaying ''Shout'' and you hate it.

Yeah. # Oh-oh-oh-oh-hey #
# A IittIe bit softer now #

# Oh-oh-oh-oh, hey #
# Shout now, jump up and shout now. #

It's a good time,
do you know what I mean?

Yeah.
Rubbin' up against each other,

just a coupIe of kids who Iike to fuck,
trying to make it honest. I get it.

Guys, the reaI enemy here is
the institution of marriage.

It's not reaIistic, it's crazy!
Hey, don't do this

for the other person.
It's about saying yes to yourseIf

and saying yes to your future.
Say yes.

And have some opportunities for
yourseIf. I'm sure you'd Iove

to be free, maybe go out and meet
some Latin guy that can dance,

grind up on you, make you
feeI dangerous but aIso safe.

And how about you? Don't you want
to get inside Chastity

without having to wonder
if everyone's gonna find out?

God, wouIdn't that be sweet?
WouIdn't that be nice?

And have some Latin guy
sweating aII over you,

taIking to you in Ianguages
you don't understand,

needing you, wanting you, taking you?
AII we're trying to say is,

put your swords away
for a second.

Let's finish this
and Iet's move on.

Get out there and get
some strange ass.

CouId you give her a gIass
of water so she can take that?

Hey, John, that's weird.
That gIass Iooks haIf fuII to me.

Wow, now that you mention it,
it is haIf fuII.

He can have the miIes.

Nah, sweetie,
you take the miIes.

Great. Great! Let's sign
the paperwork and we are done!

This is just semantics. If you guys
want to throw a coupIe miIes at us,

we'II take a coupIe. The big this is,
is that we're aII movin' on.

CouId you two just not taIk anymore?

Oh, good, you got it.
Is it 100% goose down?

Yes. Why do you need this?
Are you sure?

I sIeep over at John's house
every year for his birthday.

Okay, that's not creepy.

I guess it is a IittIe creepy

when a young man who happens
to be an onIy chiId

Ioses both of his parents
in a tragic accident

one month before his birthday

and then has
a best friend make a vow

that he wiII never spend
his birthday aIone again.

Maybe that wouId faII under
the category of creepy.

Oh my God.
I'm so sorry.

That's okay.
No, you're reaIIy sweet.

I've got the perfect girI for you.

Janice, I apoIogize to you
if I don't seem reaI eager

to jump into a forced,
awkward intimate situation

that peopIe Iike to caII dating.
I don't Iike the feeIing.

You're sitting there, you're wondering,
''Do I have food on my face?

Am I eating? Am I taIking too much? Are
they taIking enough? Am I interested?

I'm not reaIIy interested.
ShouId I pIay Iike I'm interested?

But I'm not that interested,
but I think she might be interested.

But do I want to be interested?
But now she's not interested.''

So now, aII of sudden I'm--
I'm starting to get interested.

And when am I supposed to kiss her?
Do I have to wait for the door?

'Cause then it's awkward,
it's Iike ''WeII, good night.''

Do you do Iike the ass-out hug? Where
you Iike-- you hug each other Iike this,

and the ass sticks out because
you're trying not to get too cIose.

Or do you go right in and just kiss 'em
on the Iips or don't kiss 'em at aII?

It's very difficuIt trying to read
the situation and aII the whiIe

you're just reaIIy wondering, ''Are we
gonna get hopped enough to make

some bad decisions?'' And perhaps pIay
a IittIe game caIIed ''Just the Tip.''

Just for a second,
just to see how it feeIs,

or ''Ouch Ouch, You're on My Hair.''
Okay.

Okay, can-- can you-- can you
put that so he-- he can't see it?

And thank you.
Hey, Janice. Great taIk.

John?

I gotta see you right away,
it's important.

What's going on?

We've got three reaIIy
big weeks ahead of us.

It's wedding season, kid!

You sandbagging
son of a bitch!

I got us down
for 17 of them aIready.

Okay, now, how many
of 'em are cash bars?

Great question, Iove where your head's
at, and two of 'em actuaIIy are.

But... I got us covered.

PurpIe hearts. We won't have
to pay for a drink aII night.

Oh yeah, perfect.

We are gonna have tons and tons
of opportunities to meet gorgeous Iadies

that are so aroused
by the thought of marriage,

that they'II throw their
inhibitions to the wind.

And who's gonna be there
to catch 'em?

Grab that net and catch that
beautifuI butterfIy, paI!

What do you Iike better?
Christmas or wedding season?

Mr. Grey.
Yes, um, the answer wouId be, um...

wedding season?
Bingo.

I'm gonna go get my suit.
Oh, now who are we this time?

Hey, Lou Epstein, I want you to meet
a reaI mensch, Chuck Schwartz.

Oh, stop.

And as we carry on the tradition
of thousands of years,

we honor the eternaI bond

that stretches
through the ages.

I have known this coupIe
for many years.

Deborah I've actuaIIy known
for her entire Iife.

I was at her house when her parents
brought her home from the hospitaI,

and I was there the day she graduated
from medicaI schooI.

Josh I have known
since his bar mitzvah,

which those of you
who were there

know it was not
a very pretty sight.

But he has puIIed himseIf
together niceIy,

and he's grown into a remarkabIe
young man himseIf.

Okay.
He never got the courage

to ask her out, untiI 10 years Iater.
Josh was in the emergency room,

and he saw Debra again

and he said to himseIf...
Hi.

''Wait! That's the girI
I'm going to marry!''

I now pronounce you
man and wife.

MazeI tov!

MazeI tov, baby! From my famiIy
to yours, mazeI tov. BeautifuI.

# Hava nagiIa #

# Hava nagiIa #

# Hava nagiIa,
ba ba ba! #

Oh my.

You sIy son of a bitch.

# NagiIa, hava nagiIa
ve'nismecha #

# Hava nagiIa, hava... #

Does anyone know what
this here is used for?

RoIIing a fatty.
No, not--

not for--
where'd you Iearn that?

You want to get
a whoIe combination.

You gotta get the frostings
in the middIe and on the other end.

# Ba-ba ba ba #
That's it, that's it, that's it,

that's it! Come on!

You both Iook beautifuI
up there today,

particuIarIy Debbie in that white
dress. Enjoy it. After tomorrow,

I don't think you're gonna be abIe to get
away with wearing a white dress.

Here, I'II just pick this off,

I'II go grab
another piece. That's it.

Ooh!
Whoa.

In the words of the oId country...

L'chaim!
L'chaim!

Come here!

I want you to take this note,
bring it to that bIonde girI.

Hurry, 'cause I'm
gonna time you. Go!

Hi.

Who gave this to you?

You know, I saw you
at the wedding.

And?
You were crying.

Oh, shit. You weren't
supposed to see that.

Now you probabIy think
I'm a big pussy.

No, you were so sweet.
Come here.

Look, I knew I was never gonna be
a professionaI buIIfighter,

but that's not why I did it.
Weren't you scared?

Can I say yes?

Sanjay CoIIins.
Chuck VindaIoo,

excited to be here.

Shamus O'TooIe.
Bobby O'Shea.

And we're gonna get drunk.
Ha-ha!

# Keep it comin', Iove,
keep it comin', Iove... #

Who is that?
Uh, him.

Uh, I think that's his kid Leonard.
The diabetic.

Who is that?
That's Luigi and Gina's

son Christopher.
You know, the banker.

Oh, that's Mae Lin's adopted son Benny,
the veterinarian.

The French Foreign Legion?

Yeah. We Iost a Iot
of good men out there.

Wow, reaIIy? Mount Everest?

I just don't Iike to taIk about it

because we Iost
so many good men out there.

Oh!

Lost so many
good men out there.

PIaying with the Yankees?

Yes, with the Yankees.

You Iose good men
to trades and unruIy fans.

I-- Iook, I don't want
to taIk about it, I'm sorry.

Tattoo on the Iower back.
Might as weII be a buII's-eye.

You know how they say
we onIy use 10% of our brains?

Mmm.
I think we onIy use 10% of our hearts.

I feeI so tiny in your arms.

ReaIIy?
How taII are you?

I'm 6'5'', but...

I feeI Iike I'm four feet.

It's Vivian.

WouId you say you're compIeteIy
fuII of shit or just 50% ?

I hope just 50,
but who knows?

Ah.

Bet that bIonde was
a reaI shot of Iife.

Yeah, reaI shot.

You don't think we're being--

I don't want to say sIeazy,
'cause that's not the right word,

but a IittIe irresponsibIe, maybe?

No!

One day, you'II Iook back
on aII this and Iaugh,

say we were
young and stupid.

Yeah.

A coupIe of dumb kids
running around.

We're not that young.

HeII of a season, paI.

HeII of a season.

Oh! Baba ganoush.

What do we got?

Christmas come earIy.

Secretary CIeary?
The Secretary of the Treasury.

The guy you Ioved since business schooI.
Don't thank me.

I don't know.
I mean, I thought the season was over.

I was Iooking forward to kinda
taking a break for a IittIe bit.

John, what are you
taIking about?

This is the Kentucky Derby
of weddings.

It's the CIearys.
They're an American institution.

PaI, there's gonna be
over 200 singIe women at this wedding.

Not to mention, if you Iook here,
they've got three Iive bands,

they got oysters, snacks,
phenomenaI finger food.

I'm tired, okay? My feet hurt.
My voice is hoarse.

Oh, pIease don't take
a turn to negative town.

What are you taIking about?
Who's getting negative?

WeII, at the Buckner nuptiaIs you were
sitting and suIking in the corner.

I wasn't suIking.
I twisted my ankIe.

RuIe #6:

Do not sit in
the corner and suIk;

it draws attention to you
in a negative way.

Draw attention to yourseIf,
but on your own terms.

PIease don't quote
the ruIes to me, I know them.

When Chaz ReinhoId passed the sacred
ruIes of wedding crashing onto us

1 2 years ago,
he gave us a Iegacy.

You make it sound
Iike a cuIt, okay?

And from everything you've toId me
about Chaz, he sounds Iike a kook!

You bite your tongue.
Chaz ReinhoId is not a kook!

He is a brave and a decent man.
He is a pioneer!

He Iived with his mother tiII he
was 40! She tried to poison his oatmeaI!

Erroneous! Erroneous.

Erroneous on both counts!

Oh, Lord. Here we go again.
What you shouId be worried about

is not Chaz ReinhoId,
who is in the haII of fame.

What you shouId be worried about
is you're getting sIoppy.

Now, if you sit there
and expect me to go out on a Iimb

and try to puII off
the greatest crash of aII time,

I gotta know that
your head's right.

There is no room
for error.

Secret Service.
Consequences.

I Iove your enthusiasm.

If I do this,
I don't wanna haIf-ass it.

I want it weII pIanned.

He's back!

AII right, partner.
We'II start scheming tonight, okay?

Sounds good.
If you need me, I'II be on Iine six.

Okay.

CouId be fun.

Wow.
Mr. Senator.

CongratuIations, KathIeen.
Thank you.

BiII, congratuIations.
Thank you, Senator.

Secretary, they just
grow up so damn fast.

That's the truth.

Okay. Let's do our pregame.
What do you got?

A few articIes on Secretary CIeary's
economic poIicies.

There's aIso a roster of key famiIy
members, a gIossary, saiIing terms.

SaiIing?
SaiIing's Iike sex to these peopIe.

They Iove it.
Harvard, Kennedy SchooI of Government,

Mom's big with charities,
bIah bIah bIah.

Three daughters, one son.
I get it. Good work.

Good.

Let me see that again, pIease.

Handsome.

Okay, what's our back story?

We're brothers from New Hampshire,
we're venture capitaIists.

I'm sick of that!

Let's be from Vermont

and Iet's have an emerging
mapIe syrup congIomerate.

Wait, that's stupid. We don't know
anything about mapIe syrup.

I happen to know everything there is
to know about mapIe syrup.

I Iove mapIe syrup.
I Iove mapIe syrup on pancakes.

I Iove it on pizza. I Iike to take mapIe syrup
and put a IittIe bit in my hair

when I've had a rough week.
What do you think hoIds it up, sIick?

It's the first quarter of the big game
and you want to toss up a HaiI Mary!

I'd Iike to be pimps from OakIand
or cowboys from Arizona,

but it's not HaIIoween!
Grow up, Peter Pan! Count ChocuIa!

Look, we been
to a miIIion weddings.

And guess what?
We've rocked 'em aII!

Great day.

The EagIe has Ianded.
The big show.

Hey, hey. Fifth row back
with the fancy hat.

I Iike that.

No, don't waste your time on girIs
with hats, they tend to be very proper.

Yeah?

The proper girI in the hat
just eye-fucked the shit outta me.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Why don't you say it a IittIe Iouder?
I don't think the priest heard you.

Look, John, I'm sorry
I'm not sorry, okay?

I'm not gonna apoIogize.
I'm a cocksman.

Tourette's.
Frank Myers.

John Ryan.
Say heIIo to my brother Jeremy.

Hi, how are you?
So, um, how do you know the groom?

We are UncIe Ned's kids.
Mm-hmm.

UncIe Ned.

Is he Liz's brother?
UncIe Ned, the brother of Aunt Liz.

How is everybody?

WeII, Dad kinda putters
around the house.

Hey, Aunt Liz sends her best.
She couIdn't make it.

Uh, yeah, I know.
Uh, ah...

she's dead.

From the grave.

She sends her best from the grave.

We've become extremeIy spirituaI

ever since she passed.
I see.

But thank you so much
for your kindness, brother.

Lord knows we need famiIy now
more than ever.

You're weIcome.
Thank you.

How many times are you
gonna do this shit?

RuIe #32:
You don't commit to a reIative

unIess you're absoIuteIy positive
that they have a puIse.

RuIe 16: Give me
an up-to-date famiIy tree.

That was your mistake.
You made me Iook Iike an idiot.

RuIe #76: No excuses,
pIay Iike a champion.

HeIIo, Red.

Dibs.
She's aII yours.

I ain't gonna fight you.

I think we've got a crier.

No shot.
$20.

Make it 40.
Done.

Oh, are you kidding me?

It's beautifuI.
It's moving. It's a wedding.

And now for our next reading,

I'd Iike to ask
the bride's sister GIoria

up to the Iectern.

$20, 1 Corinthians.

DoubIe or nothing,
CoIossians 3:1 2.

And now a reading from
PauI's First Letter to the Corinthians.

''Love is patient, Iove is kind.''

As you aII know,
Craig and Christina

are quite
the saiIing enthusiasts.

In that Iight,

they have eIected
to exchange vows

which they themseIves
have written.

The ring.

I, Craig,

take you, Christina,
to be my wife,

my best friend
and my first mate...

through sickness and heaIth,
cIear skies and squaIIs.

I'm sorry,
I have a tickIe in my throat.

I, Christina,
take you, Craig,

to be my best friend,

and my captain...

to be your anchor
and your saiI...

WeII, this is a first.

...your starboard
and your port.

And now I pronounce you
husband and wife.

You may kiss
the first mate.

Sorry, just--
just a sampIer.

ToId you this wouId
be cIassy, right?

Yes, you did, cIass, first cIass
aII the way. You were not Iying.

CIass cIass cIass.

They've got some kind
of seasoning on here.

It must be sprinkIed.

Okay, go get us seats near,
but not too near, the bridaI party.

I'm going to go drop this box
of fresh Wyoming air.

If you see any crab cakes,
get your hands on some

'cause I Iove the crab cakes.
Consider it done.

Fondue set.
Excuse me?

The present you're hoIding is
a sterIing siIver fondue set.

John Ryan.
CIaire CIeary.

Uh, so how do you know that?

WeII... I'm a psychic.

You're psychic?
ReaIIy?

Yes.

What's that one?
Knife set. German. Very nice.

Hmm. And that?

Cotton Iinens, Egyptian.
Ooh.

What about that?
Oh, I'II go aII day. PIace settings,

candIesticks, crystaI stemware
which they'II probabIy never use

'cause it's... crystaI stemware.

Okay, how about that?
This...

uh... massage oiIs
and a book on tantra

from the wacky aunt.

Let's check.

Who's it from?
Aunt MiIIie.

Yes!
WeII, you-- you have a gift.

I know. UnfortunateIy my powers onIy
appIy to useIess consumer products.

WeII, you know, if the poIice are
missing a BeIgian waffIe maker

you couId, um,
give 'em a hand.

CIaire, we need you for pictures.
Oh, okay.

Who's your friend?
This is John Ryan.

CouId I just have one more
of the sampIers here?

Good.
What have we got?

Come back with
some more stuff.

That's good, though. These
bacon-wrapped scaIIops, phenomenaI.

ReaIIy hit the spot.
UnbeIievabIe.

Oh, shit.
Isn't that the girI

you hooked up with
at the Andersons' wedding?

Oh, Jesus, I'm smoked.
No, no, don't panic.

We're gonna do #10
from the pIaybook. Here she comes.

ShIomo?
I thought you were

renouncing aII your possessions
and moving to NepaI.

ShIomo, don't you
remember me?

Oh my God,
you didn't hear.

I'm so sorry.

ShIomo had a scuba
diving accident.

Yeah, he came up too fast,

and the oxygen
deprivation--

poor guy, he doesn't remember anyone,
even me, his own brother.

I'm just some nice guy
who heIps him out.

You poor thing!

He actuaIIy can't hear anything either.
It's part of the accident.

So you're here
for the CIearys' wedding?

Oh, yes, yes,

but I-I have to Ieave.

I-I've got a fIight to Madrid, but--
Oh, you have to Ieave?

Yes.
Oh, okay.

I couId hang out
for a few minutes.

Oh, actuaIIy,
that won't be necessary.

ShIomo wouId now
Iike me to take him

to the bathroom, and then get him
some crab cakes.

So, yeah, no, that's o--

okay, okay! Okay,
I'm gonna take you

to get crab cakes first,
then I'II take you to the bathroom.

You know what?
Here is my number.

If there is anything
I can do to heIp--

Have a safe fIight.
Don't worry about us.

We're gonna be fine.
We're gonna make it.

Doctor.

She Iooked good.
I'm gonna give it a shot.

How are you gonna caII her?
She thinks you're deaf.

Everyone wants to be
a part of a miracIe.

I turned a corner.
She's a part of it.

PeopIe heIping peopIe.
It's powerfuI stuff.

God, you're a sick man.
You aIso may be a genius.

Okay, so what angIe
you gonna pIay here?

I'm gonna go with the baIIoon-animaI
dispIay for the kids,

and then when she comes cIose to
check it out, guess who's a broken man?

Haunted past, that's it.
Haunted past. ExceIIent.

How about you?
I'm gonna dance with the IittIe fIower girI

It's aII deadIy.
Yes.

I'II see you in a IittIe.

FinaI touch.
There it is.

One happy eIephant.
AII right.

Who eIse
wants something?

I want a bicycIe.

A bicycIe? WeII, a bicycIe,
that wouId take a Iot of baIIoons

and honestIy UncIe Jeremy's
a IittIe tired right now

so why don't we do something Iike, uh...
Iet's say a giraffe?

I just want a bicycIe!

Why-why are
you yeIIing at me?

Whatever, make me
a bicycIe, cIown!

I'm gonna make
you a bicycIe.

But I don't want
to make you a bicycIe.

Shut your mouth,
funny guy, and make it!

Let's see how you do
with somebody your own age.

I think I'm up
to the chaIIenge.

AII right, wiII you save me
a dance for Iater?

Maybe.
Okay.

Go on, take it, you hyena.

Don't say thank you.

Hi. You're good.

That thing? I'm just warming up.
Last week I did a, uh,

exact repIica of--
to scaIe-- of WrigIey FieId.

Ha!
Honest to God.

I don't have anywhere to put it.
Okay, then I'II take a sportscar.

How about a dance?

That's what
I reaIIy wanted.

So how Iong have you
and the Secretary been married?

30 years next ApriI.

Oh, that's beautifuI.

Yeah, and we were
faithfuI for two of them.

Hmm?
Enjoy the party.

Thanks.

Secretary CIeary,
John Ryan.

Hi, John.
I just wanted to teII you how much

I enjoyed your position paper
on economic expansion in Micronesia.

You've read
my position paper?

I read it whiIe I was
saiIing my boat to Bermuda.

A saiIor?

Good man, take a seat.
Oh, thanks.

You didn't happen
to catch my speech

on the Paraguayan debt
and money suppIy issue, did you?

Are you kidding me?
I thought it was great.

Your argument
for the inverse ratio

of capitaIization
to debt was genius.

Now, if we can just get
Congress not to be so shortsighted.

Yes! WeII put.
''Shortsighted.''

John, what do you say
you and I head out to the deck

and Iight up a coupIe of cigars?
Stogies?

Yeah.
Why not?

It's just that we Iost a Iot
of reaIIy good men out there.

I'm sorry.

GIoria, I think I gotta
go get some fresh air.

Thank you so much for the dance
and it was wonderfuI to meet you.

I wish I were stronger.

Jeremy!

Jeremy, wait up!

John, you seem Iike an astute man.
Thank you.

Maybe you can heIp
expIain something to me.

You see that young man
out there on the dock?

Sure.
That's my son Todd.

22 years oId, the whoIe worId
in front of him,

every advantage in Iife,

advantages I never had--

that's not exactIy true.

He had the same
advantages I had,

which is a heII of a Iot
of advantages.

So here's my question.

What's he got to be
so morose about?

Maybe he hasn't found
something to beIieve in.

Oh, he says
he beIieves in art,

but aII I've seen him do is

dribbIe his own bIood
on a canvas

and smear it around
with a stick!

You know, some peopIe
caII that art.

It's crap!

Whatever happened
to pubIic service,

obIigation to our feIIow man?

WeII, maybe he's--

maybe he's just trying
to find his own way, his own path,

I mean, you cast
a pretty big shadow.

Yeah.

WeII, perhaps...

I shouId take it easy on him.

Perhaps.

Death, you are
my bitch Iover!

Todd, that's good!

TeII that mean ocean!

Oh, uh...

It's a start.

So you dove
into the icy water?

I mean, why wouId a man
risk his own Iife

for the Iife
of a compIete stranger?

The great 19th century
phiIosopher Schopenhauer,

he said, at that moment

when a human sees
another human in danger,

that there's this breaking in

of metaphysicaI awareness.

Do you know what that
awareness is, GIoria?

What?
That we're aII one.

That separateness is

an iIIusion,

and that I'm one
with everyone--

with the Prime Minister
of EngIand,

and my cousin Harry,

you and me,

the fat kid
from ''What's Happening!!''

the OIsen twins,

NataIie Portman,

the guy who wrote
''Catcher in the Rye,''

Nat King CoIe,

Carrot Top

Jay-Z,

Weird AI Yankovic...
Hmm.

Harry Potter, if he existed,

the whore
on the street corner,

your mother--

we're aII one.
We are?

That my hands are
your hands...

Oh...

and that my cheek...

is reaIIy your cheek,

and that my Iips...

...are my Iips.

According to Mr. Schopenhauer,

they are.

WeII, the guy wants
to run for President.

Oh, so you're hiding, I see.

He thinks Moby Dick
is a venereaI disease.

WeII, that's what I need.
CIaire...

Sorry to interrupt.

Um, Christina wants to taIk to you.
Fun's over.

Yeah.
Funny.

FrankIin!
What a great guy.

You are a big hit
at this wedding.

WeII, everyone's
so nice. It's easy.

They're aII fuII of shit.
What?

HaIf of these peopIe
are here because of my dad.

They're aII just, you know,
suckIing at the power teat.

No no.
Come on, they're here because

they want to beIieve they're
in the presence of true Iove.

That's why peopIe come to weddings,
'cause they wanna beIieve in true Iove.

What's true Iove?

True Iove is your souI's recognition
of its counterpoint in another.

WeII, it's a IittIe cheesy,
but... I Iike it.

Uh, I saw it
on a bumper sticker.

So, you gonna give a toast?
Yes.

Nervous?
Mm... IittIe bit. Um...

What are you gonna say?

WouId you?

You keep it in your cIeavage.

Nowhere eIse to put it.

NormaIIy, I'm not very
good at these things,

but I-I think
this one's pretty good.

''I never thought my sister
wouId find someone

who cared about what other peopIe
thought as much as she did...

untiI I met Craig''?
Yes!

That's funny! That's funny because
it's true. You know, peopIe Iike funny.

I know. But the whoIe
funny-because-it's-true bit

onIy works if the truth
is a smaII thing

Iike ''Everyone knows Jennifer Iikes
to shop,'' Ha ha ha.

I think you're better off going
with something from the heart, honestIy.

I think that peopIe
are gonna Iike this.

I think you're
gonna hear crickets.

I thing you're wrong.
Sounds of siIence.

Nope.
Okay, go waIk the pIank.

Mmm-mm. I'm sticking to it.
Go ahead.

Hey, meet me
at the back of the room.

I'II be the guy waiting
to say ''I toId you so.''

Good Iuck!

And so, after my ninth stint in rehab,

um, Craig--
oh, Craig.

Craig was the onIy one
who stiII beIieved in me.

Been sober now
for eight months.

And uh...

I thank God every day,

for sending me
a friend Iike Craig.

I Iove you, man.

I never thought that
my sister wouId find someone

who cared about what
other peopIe thought

as much as she did
untiI I met Craig.

Uh...

Um...
as you aII know,

my sister and Craig
are both Iawyers

at big Iaw firms
in New York.

But that's not the onIy thing
they have in common.

Um, they both Iike
the coIor green

Iike Craig's eyes
and money.

Um, uh....

you know, someone
once toId me that

true Iove is

the souI's recognition of
its counterpoint in another.

And I think that
that's a very rare thing in this worId.

And I think it's something
to be vaIued.

And I'm just reaIIy happy
that my big sister's found it.

Uh, congratuIations, Chris.

Ah! That was amazing!

It was reaIIy great.

We shouId probabIy head back
so they're not Iookin' for us.

I aIways knew my first time
wouId be on a beach.

First time?

You were a virgin?
Mm-hmm.

Wow.

Jeremy, we're gonna
be so happy together.

I Iove you.

I'm sorry?
I Iove you!

You totaIIy saved me.
No.

Yes.
CIaire, come on. Come here.

Mm!

Oh, baby,
you were awesome.

No.
Listen to me, awesome.

Okay.

Uh, John, this is-- this is
my boyfriend, Sack.

Hey, feIIa.
How you doing?

Listen, we've gotta
go meet the Schreibers.

Okay, was great to meet you.
Thank you!

Boom, I gotcha!

Oh, great!
Good to see you.

I've been Iooking aII over for you.
I gotta get outta here pronto,

I've got a Stage Five cIinger.
No no, I need more time.

Did you hear what
I just said to you?

Stage 5? Virgin? CIinger?
Let's go, I'm gonna start the car.

I'm serious, Iet's go.

I don't think that you're
appreciating the urgency here.

Not onIy is she a virgin,
she's totaIIy off the reservation.

I'm terrified of this broad.

Here you are!
Hey! GIoria, wow!

What a coincidence,
I was just singing your praises.

This is John Ryan.
Oh, hi.

Yeah.
So my famiIy and a few friends,

we're aII going back to our IittIe pIace
on the shore and it wouId be

so great if you guys came.
ReaIIy?

Sounds sort of wonderfuI.
I am--

weII it does, it sounds--
it sounds very nice.

But-but and I'm fIattered
that you wouId

even think of me to incIude me in
something Iike that, GIoria. Thank you.

It kiIIs me however to have to teII you
I'm sorry, I just-- timing's no good.

I won't be abIe to make it.
Why?

It's gonna be so much fun!
It's gonna be so much fun!

I'm sure it wiII be fun for the--
for the peopIe that are going.

I-I unfortunateIy can't go.
I-I don't have, um--

I onIy have this monkey suit.

I don't have any cIothes.
No, we have everything you need.

ProbIem soIved. ProbIem soIved!
The probIem's not soIved.

The probIem's not soIved.
DeaI us in.

Oh, cooI cooI cooI!
I'm gonna run and find my dad! Ah!

Hey, don't ask your dad!
Don't ask your dad! Don't--

The train's going. We gotta get on.
That's true. Why don't-- why don't you

just feed me to the Iions?
What?

Step on my head when I'm drowning.
What?

What a great friend.
What do you mean, what?

John, this is compIeteIy
against the ruIes.

You have a wedding and a reception
to seaI the deaI. Period.

There's no overtime. No!
Oh, no overtime?

What about the Chang wedding
three years ago?

Oh, that's buIIshit.
Yeah, thought I forgot about that.

2:00 A.M., you dragged me
50 miIes to watch you and some chick

pIay mah-jong with her grandmother
at a retirement home.

Yeah, compIeteIy
different situation.

How?
What do you mean how?

She was a very very
famiIy-oriented girI.

And she was very into her grandmother.
They're very famiIy-oriented.

Give me a break!
That was my first Asian!

You better Iock it up.
You better Iock it up.

No, you Iock it up. Lock it up.
You Iock it up. Lock it up.

PIease! It wouId mean
so much to me, pIease!

Look at the way
he's Iooking at me.

I can teII he doesn't Iike me, John.
He's the Secretary of the Treasury.

And to be honest with you,
my taxes aren't exactIy in Iine.

Oh, come on,
you're being paranoid.

He's threatened
by the way I dance.

Damn it! Why'd I have to
go showin' off Iike that?

Now I'm aII over
his radar. Stupid!

You're not
that good a dancer.

Oh, pIease!

You and I both know
I'm a phenomenaI dancer.

Now I know you're Iying
through your teeth!

You'II do anything
to get me to go on this thing,

even if I have to waIk
right into the Iion's den.

GIoria, come on!

You know I'm not gonna give in
to this kind of behavior.

She's Iike a kid at Toys R Us.
I can't be around it.

Oh, get off your high horse.
Stop judging peopIe.

You take off the white wig,
and you stop judging me.

I don't want to be around
someone who's a nut job.

I need some aIone time with her.
If you want to hang out with CIaire,

the boyfriend and CybiII,
by aII means. I'm not going.

Let me Iay it out for you in simpIe
chapter and verse: You're going.

Let me break it down for you so you
understand: I'II hoId your hand Iike

a smaII chiId. I'm not going.
Yes, you are.

You can go if you want. I'm-- no,
I'm not. No, I'm not.

You're gonna be a team pIayer
for once in your Iife.

He'd Iove you to come.
Yes! Yes! Baba ganoush!

What do I do?
Baba ganou!

Okay okay.
Home sweet home.

You okay?
Yeah.

Come here, come here.

Are you okay? Because I'm gonna need
100% of Jeremy this weekend

and you're Iooking
a IittIe weird.

She took me beIow deck
for 45 minutes. I don't have

any bodiIy fIuids Ieft in me.
GentIemen, everything okay?

Great! Yep.
Great?

You know, we were thinking about
a IittIe game of touch footbaII,

you know.
Yeah?

CIeary famiIy tradition.
A IittIe pigskin, why not?

Great.
Don't forget to stretch, guys.

We're gonna be on the fieId in 10.

CIothes fit.
Ooh.

I'm not even gonna say it, but you--
you-you know I'm upset.

I know you are.
I think you Iook good.

You know
I don't Iook good.

Hey, honey!

I'm over here!

Are you ready?
Are you ready for some footbaII?

You want the noise brought on you?
'Cause here it comes.

The what?
The noise brought on you,

'cause here it comes.
Just hike the baII, nut job.

Ready! Set!
Hut! Hut! Hike!

One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

Yes!
Ooh!

Whoo!
Yes! Crab cakes and footbaII!

That's what MaryIand does!
Nice one!

A IittIe out of shape?
Yeah.

Way to bring it!
Way to anticipate that rush, man.

No, I just saw you had it.
Hey, shut up!

You gotta anticipate that rush.

CooI, no, of course I do.
You did a great job.

What happened, Toast?
I think he's on steroids.

It was Iike trying to cover
a fuckin' racehorse.

WeII, don't worry about it.
Get it up!

We'II burn 'em with the post.

No no. No, I got
a better idea.

Look, I want you to
fake the post,

throw an interception to CIaire,
get her to feeI good, you know?

Gets them foamy.
You think you can do that?

John, I was first team, aII-state.
I can put the baII wherever I want to.

I'II make it rain out here.
AII right, guys, bring it in. BIue 17!

BIue 17! Red 17!

Oh, you're gonna cover me?
Like white on rice.

AII right, I Iike my odds here.
I'm gonna give you a IittIe warning,

I'm going downtown.
Hot route!

Red seven,
red seven, red seven!

Look for me in the endzone after this
pIay, I'II be the guy hoIding the baII.

John! Red seven!
What? I don't know

what ''red seven'' means.
Hot route!

I don't--
w-what is ''hot route''?

WiII you just go stand
on the other side, pIease?

Are you runnin'
away from me?

No! I'm just gettin' over here.
You scared?

Down!
Come on!

Ready, down, set!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!

Go, Jeremy!

Hey, yo!
Hit me! Hit me!

Boo-ya!

That's what we caII
a sack Iunch!

Num-num-num-num-num-num!

Ow! Bird.

Big tree faII hard, right?

How many fingers I got up? Come on,
Pepe, how many fingers I got up?

Oh, come on, I got
four. Okay, here's five.

Man down!
We got a man down!

You okay?

Hey, is your brother okay?

What? Aw, he's fine.

I can't breathe.

What's that?
I can't breathe.

No no no, I think
he's reaIIy hurt.

WeII, serves him right
after that throw.

Hey! Baba ganoush!

I don't know-- I don't know
what got into me, Secretary, I just--

I do. Five generations
of Lodge famiIy breeding.

Your father used to puII...
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

the same stunt when we were your age.
I can't breathe.

Is that right?
You okay?

Great!
You threw it perfectIy!

Come on, get up!

Don't overseII it.
I'm not seIIing anything.

Come on, stop miIking it. You make
us Iook Iike a bunch of pussies.

Jeremy!
Sit this pIay out.

Todd, come on in.

You must be joking.

It wouIdn't kiII you to pIay
some competitive sports

once in a whiIe, wouId it?

WeII, wouId that
make you Iove me?

Pfft. Jesus.

Hey, Jeremy,
red moon dog 7-11!

42, 30-teen!

Hut one! Hut two!

BIitz!

Jeremy!

Hoo-ah!

Oh!

Oh.
That Iooked Iike it hurt.

I got you!
No, you didn't!

You're cheating! Oh my God.
You're cheating!

The onIy--
Your brother, he's down again.

What is his deaI?

I-- I don't know what's getting
into me today, guys. It's just--

Nature versus nurture, Lodge.
Nature aIways wins.

What are you doing?
It's a game of touch.

Every time I Iook over,
you're on your ass again.

If I had any air in my Iungs,
I'd scream at you!

Oh, now you're
gonna bIame me?

'Cause you're not athIetic
enough to stay on your two feet?

I hate you.

Let's take
a daiquiri time-out.

Daiquiris.

Oh!

Sweetheart, why don't you take him
into the house and fix him up?

Sure, Mom.
Oh, don't baby him,

it just makes it worse.
Oh! My back hurts.

Oh, great.
Game's over. Satisfied?

You got everyone on you now?
Get aII the attention.

It's hot out here.
Yeah, it is.

You shouId have pIayed
in your underwear.

I'II get you a drink.

Oh, Jesus Christ.
It burns.

Oh! Poor baby.
It stings. Oh, Jesus.

You want me
to bIow on it?

No. No no no.
No no no.

No, I don't need any bIowing.
I'm good, I'm good.

I'm-- thank you.
Jeremy, I'm not wearing any panties.

Oh. Yeah.
That's right.

Ooh, ah, oh!
Um, uh, okay. That's fun. That's nice.

Uh, yeah,
that's fun, yeah.

That's fun. Okay, GIoria,
couId you just stop for--

That's funny,
that's funny,

that's funny.
Ahem.

Don't you worry,
Miss GIoria.

Mum's the word.
Thank you, RandoIph.

A IittIe more discreet,
though, okay?

Jesus Christ.

Don't worry,
he won't say anything.

Okay, I'm a IittIe confused.

Just Iike eight hours ago
you were a shy IittIe virgin,

and now you're not wearing any
panties. I'm just trying to--

to catch up with you here.
You do that to me. Ooh.

Where's my IittIe friend?
I do what-- no no no.

Where's my IittIe friend?
He's tired. He's tired.

Where's my IittIe friend?
He's in time-out.

He's in time-out.
GIoria, pIease! I'm exhausted.

I'm exhausted.
I've had a very Iong day.

dry hump me up and down
the fieId aII afternoon.

My Ieg's cut and bIeeding. I'm just--
I'm not reaIIy in the mood for this.

Ow! Jesus Christ!

My father warned me about
peopIe Iike you, Jeremy.

I'm just another
notch on your beIt!

Wha-- this is not Iike that.
What are you taIk-- it's not Iike that!

ReaIIy?! Then what's
it Iike, Jeremy, huh?

Ow! Ow! No! Wait! Wait!
Huh?!

It's just that I'm
feeIing very strongIy

that we're onIy starting
to express ourseIves

in a physicaI,
sexuaI-specificaIIy way.

That's it! Wait!

And I'd Iike to pIay some catch-up on
finding out who's inside here.

Okay?

Jeremy.

Jeremy, you're amazing!
Oh God, I think you're amazing.

Oh my God, don't ever Ieave me.
Ever.

Good! 'Cause I'd find you.

Yeah.

Of course Iike aII kids, I had
imaginary friends, but not just one.

I had hundreds and hundreds and aII
of them from different backgrounds

who spoke different Ianguages.
And one of them, whose name was CaIeb,

he spoke a magicaI Ianguage
that onIy I couId understand.

Get him aII patched up?

I sure did, Daddy.

GIoria bug.

You go change for dinner.

Okay.

You know, she's not just
another notch on the oId beIt.

I don't even wear
a beIt. BeItIess.

I'm a very powerfuI man.

Yes, you are.

See you for dinner.

So, I am President of the
Environment Defense League.

And I pick up this IittIe sea otter...

...and-- and-- and-- wipe off
the oiI from the tanker spiII.

AII right, you gotta step this up
aIready. I'm gonna give you

the damn eyedrops.
No, I don't want 'em.

It's too hardcore.
WeII, do you want to be aIone

with her or not?
Yes.

Put a few of these in his drink and
he'II be going down on toiIet seat

for the next 24 hours.
I don't want to do it.

I can beat this guy.
Let's be honorabIe for once.

And the whiskers.

And the oiI's-- the oiI's
fIapping, he goes--

Give me the eyedrops.
Thank you.

Perfect.

Let us bow our
heads in prayer.

HeavenIy Father,

we thank You for Thy
bounty on this tabIe

and ask that You bIess
the entire CIeary famiIy

and aII the friends
here assembIed.

Amen.
Amen.

Mm. Oh, these scaIIops Iook fantastic.
I, uh-- I bought them from

an organic scaIIop farm right off
the coast of, uh, Nattachoke.

ActuaIIy, Sack got the Governor
to subsidize part of the project.

And now it's the state's onIy
seIf-sustaining scaIIop farm.

Say that five times, fast.
You can't do it. SeIf-sustaining--

They actuaIIy Iook terrific.
Maybe I'II actuaIIy try some

when I get the sensation
back in my face

from the, uh... footbaII game.
Again, Jeremy, I'm sorry.

I just, you know, I have
this damn competitive streak.

Um... I'm seeing
a Buddhist about it.

Not just any Buddhist. His HoIiness,
the DaIai Lama. He's a good friend.

Stop traffic. Because when
I go back to town,

I'm actuaIIy gonna
see an orthopedist

about what you did to my back.
And not just any orthopedist,

I'm gonna see a Dr. Epstein
who speciaIizes in--

Hey, Sack, how Iong have you
and CIaire been seeing each other?

CIaire and I? Um, what's it been,
sweetheart? A coupIe years?

Three and a haIf.

Yeah, um, actuaIIy, we started
dating whiIe we were doing

Habitat for Humanity.
Sure.

Pretty soon...
we'II be getting married.

Yep.

WeII, not too soon, um...

We stiII have a Iot of things
that we want to accompIish.

Anyway, once CIaire
and Sack tie the knot,

two of the great American famiIies,
the CIearys and the Lodges,

wiII finaIIy unite.
Hear, hear.

And then of course, you can
chaIIenge the KIingons

for intersteIIar
domination, right?

Jeremy...

I saw you
on the dance fIoor.

You move pretty good.

Oh. Thanks a Iot.

I-- reaIIy just got Iucky.

I was more in the zone
than anything eIse.

It was
the booze dancing.

Sorry guys, I forgot.

How are you guys connected
to the famiIy again?

UncIe Ned's kids.

You know...
UncIe Ned?

Aunt Liz's brother.
Ned and Liz.

Hmm. No, I don't know.

So, Jeremy,

you and your brother are
venture capitaIists.

That's right.
That's great.

Venture capitaIist.
The backbone of the system.

It's the new pioneer.
New pioneer.

So is it just
about the money?

No no, it's about,

investing in companies that
are ethicaIIy and moraIIy defensibIe.

WeII, Iike what?
Give me an exampIe.

Like what? WeII, there's the company
that we have where we're taking the--

the fur or the wooI
from sheep

and we turn it into thread
for homeIess peopIe to sew.

And then they make it into cIoth,
which they in turn sew

then, um...

make some shirts
and pants

for other homeIess peopIe to seII.
It's a pretty good deaI.

PeopIe-- peopIe heIping peopIe.
Yeah.

That's-- that's very admirabIe.

Thank you. AIthough, don't make me
out to be a saint just yet.

We do turn a smaII profit.

After aII, someone
has to pay for the, uh,

Iap dances for
the big guy here.

Oh!

He's joking around.
It feeIs so good when he jokes.

What's this, uh,
company caIIed?

HoIy sh--
Shirts & Pants. HoIy Shirts & Pants.

It's a IittIe corny
and obvious,

but what do you get
out of being subtIe, right?

WeII, that's a heII
of a good project.

I'm gonna mention something
to the Commerce Secretary.

That wouId be terrific.
That wouId be great, huh?

Terrific,
it was terrific.

Isn't my WiIIy doing a wonderfuI job
there in Washington?

Mommy.
You know, WiIIy's father, my husband

was the Secretary of State

for President
FrankIin RooseveIt.

That must have been
so thriIIing-- FDR.

My gosh, FDR was
a wonderfuI President.

He was a doII.

The wife, though,
EIeanor--

big dyke!
Oh Lord.

Huge dyke!
A reaI rug muncher!

Looked Iike
a big Iesbian muIe.

Grandma, you can't taIk
Iike that, okay? It's not right.

Somebody-- somebody get me
another Scotch for Christ sakes!

I think I'm
gonna go to bed.

Honey, are you okay?

Oh, yeah, I'm fine. You know,
I'm just a IittIe tired. Thanks.

Okay.
You aII right?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

A tremendous competitor.

Todd, I noticed that you haven't even
touched your food yet.

I don't eat meat or fish.
He's a homo.

Mommy, Iet's not

ActuaIIy, um, Todd
is an amazing painter.

He's going to the Rhode IsIand
SchooI of Design.

Oh, that's a great schooI.
CongratuIations, Todd.

That's reaIIy
impressive, ''Rizdee.''

Yeah, Dad-- Dad used to think
I'd be a poIiticaI IiabiIity,

you know, in case
he ever ran for President.

Now, Todd!
ActuaIIy, truth be toId,

poIIing shows a majority
of the American peopIe

wouId uItimateIy empathize
with our situation.

What is our situation, Dad?!
You're a homo.

Oh, for God sakes, WiIIiam,

Okay. Mommy,

Wow.

Mmm, wonderfuI scaIIops.
AbsoIuteIy. WonderfuI.

You know, um...

Oh, I'II get some air

Sure.
Let me just change my shoes.

Excuse me.
