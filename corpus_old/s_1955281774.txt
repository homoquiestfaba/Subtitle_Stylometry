Freeze, motherfucker!

Fuck!

Goddamn it!

He jumped, he's going
down to the ninth floor,

the ninth floor!

Mike, he's on the ninth floor.

Goddamn it, now stop!

I said stop, motherfucker.

Shit!

Relax, relax, relax!

Just get the fuck off me!
(Chris grunts)

Freeze, goddamn it!
[Nick] Oh, shit!


You're pretty, motherfucker.

Did little Nicky fall
down and get bruised?


Shut the fuck up, Nicky!

That's gonna leave a mark, Nick.

When the fuck did you turn 5-0?

Why'd you run out on us?

Man, fuck you!

Hell, this is bullshit!

Shut the fuck up!

All you had to do was
give us a name, man.

Man, you ain't got nothin' on me, man.

One name, you could've walked.

Man, I didn't do nothin'!

Chris.

What's this?

Oh, hell no, you know
that shit ain't mine!

Shut the fuck up.

Looks like some high
quality cocaine, Nick.

Get up, you little shit.

Took you a long time for this, Nick.

You know that shit ain't mine!

Nick, this is Officer
Donnelly, I'm Officer White,

you're under arrest.

[Nick] Fuck you!
Nice to meet you, Nick.

You have the right to remain silent.

So, what's the verdict, Harris?

Lookin' fine, real fine.
(Denise laughs)

I'm talking about the bus.

The bus is a piece of
shit, but it looks great.

Is this the best they could do?

Yeah, this is the
pick of the motor pool.

I can do the best for
the youth of America.

Speakin' of these young
Americans, what we lookin' at?

You're gonna love this.

First up is Cecile Washington,
also known as "Ce-Ce."

Fresh out of a 28-day stay.

And that?

Since the home, like
mother, like daughter.

What do we have here?

This one is Nicholas Gordon.

a real wannabe badass.

Oh yeah, he's a badass all right.

Next, Ray-Ray,

Raymond Martin.

He came up in the streets with Nick.

Who's Cinderella?

some little lost girl,

she started a fire at school.

And that earned her a spot
here with the wild bunch?

Whole school burned down.

Next, we have Eddie Jasper.

He don't look too tough.


for the African-American people.

He'll debate your ear off,
but he's pretty harmless.

He was just at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

All right, listen up.

You already know me.

The gentleman to my right
is Lt. Harris Redding.

We will be your chaperones
on this little excursion.

Just where the fuck are we goin' again?

Didn't your mama ever teach you it's

it's not polite to interrupt
others? Understand?

And watch your fuckin' mouth, boy.

Nick, we're going to Lakahachee Canyon.


Listen up, badass number two,

you start showing some R-E-S-P-E-C-T,

else you gonna find
out what it mean to me.

Shit, bro, get with the times.

Don't be quoting that 1960s shit at me.


It's Lakahachee Canyon, all right kids?

It's 200 miles away.

We're gonna be there for 90 days.

We're doing some renovations on a home

for some youthful
offenders like yourselves.

Any questions?

Yes?

Do you think that maybe
we'd be able to call home?

Call home?

So you can talk to Mommy?

No, I just thought that...

No, you don't think!

You just listen, little girl.

Until told otherwise,

Miss Martinez is your
mommy and I'm your daddy.

You got that?

everybody on the bus.

All right, all right.

Let's not make this any
worse than it has to be.

no clowning around.

When do we stop and get
somethin' to eat, man?

I'm starving.

We stop when I get hungry.

Yo, are you sure this thing is safe?

Man, quit complaining.

This thing'll get us there
and halfway back. (Chuckles)

(instrumental R&B music)

Hey, Charlotte?

How you holdin' up?

I can't believe I'm even here.

None of us really wanna be here.

But, we gotta suck it up and
make the best of it, right?


What do you say we pull
over and grab a bite to eat?

Sign back there said
there's a place up ahead.

Sounds good.

Oh, hell no! This has gotta be a joke,

what the hell are we stopping here for?

What's wrong with here?

It's a damn rat hole.

Then why don't you guys crawl right in

and make yourselves at home?

Look, bitch!

You keep talkin' like
that, you're gonna be

drinkin' your food
through a fuckin' straw!

All right, everybody, now listen up.

No one wanders off, okay?

Neither Harris or myself
wants to come lookin' for ya.

It's gonna really piss us off.

(birds chirping)

Okay! Use the bathroom if you have to,

get something to eat and get back on board.

You mean we gotta eat here too?

That's affirmative.

Then, we gotta get back on the road ASAP.

And number two, hurry up.

Why?

Because that's number
two, hurry up, now let's go.

(Ray laughs)

Sorry I asked.

Any other questions?

Are you wearing any panties?


Let's go.

Ce-Ce, aren't you gonna go?

No.

We don't have another
stop for a really long time.

I'm okay, okay?

Is this about Ray-Ray and
Nick, 'cause believe me,

I can take care of them.

I don't need nobody taking
care of nothing for me.

I'm just not hungry, is that all right?

That's fine.

Suit yourself.

(blow dryer)

What the fuck are you doing?

I'm just arming myself,
I need condoms, man.

Don't want some little
bastard talkin' shit about me

20 years from now, you know
what I'm sayin'? (Chuckles)

You actually think
you're gonna get somewhere

with these crazy bitches?

That Ce-Ce's pretty fine.

Ce-Ce's a cold fish.

Well, a couple months
out in the damn boonies

might just warm her up
if you know what I mean?

Now, Miss Martinez, she's fine.

Martinez?
[Ray] Yeah.

Man, she's a cop.

Oh well, I mean damn, she
ain't no cop when she naked.

Ain't nowhere to pin the badge. (Chuckles)

Hey, Charlotte.
Hey.


Where's Ce-Ce?

Still on the bus.

You spoke to her yet?

About what?

Anything?

No. She's hardly said two words to me.

Why?

I don't know I'm just trying to

figure that girl out, you know?

Good luck.

(dramatic music)

Hey, you doin' okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Need a little catnap, let me know, okay?

You ever driven one of these things?


I'll bet you could.
(Denise laughs)


What was that?
Didn't sound good.

What is going on now?

Looks like we're fucked?

Okay everybody, just calm down,

we're gonna pull over and check it out.

I knew it, I knew it.
(suspenseful music)

I wanna get a closer
look at this engine.

Okay, I'm gonna try to
get someone on the cell,

get some help.

Look, can we get some air up in here?

I'm dyin' of carbon dioxide.


Something funny, bitch?

It's "carbon monoxide," moron.

That's the sort of thing
you would've learned

had you made it past the third grade.

Look, motherfucker,
I'll show you third grade.

All right you guys!

Just settle down, okay?

Yeah, sure.

I heard some crazy shit about

people that live in places like this.

Yeah, those chainsaw
families out here and shit?

Crazy fuckers be wearin' a brother's face

like a Halloween mask and shit.

Ooh, shit yeah.

And you don't even wanna
be trying to barbecue,

you know what I'm saying?

Keep your mouths shut and
your asses in the seats.

(engine hisses)


Engine's gone.

Luck is one thing we're
shit out of just now.

Can't get a signal on
the cell phone, either?

Why does this shit always happen to me?


(Ray imitates eerie sound effects)

Well, looks like one of us
is gonna have to go for help.

One of us.

You ever been in the woods?

No, not really.

It's okay. I love the great outdoors.

to happy, Miss Charlotte.

Shut up!
(both laugh)

Now listen, why don't
you take the guys with you?

I think it's safer that way.

Maybe I would feel
safer if they're with me,

for your sake.

Listen, take the cell phone,

maybe you can get a signal
out there somewhere,

call for help.

Great. Maybe I can order pizza.

Let's get the troops.

(dramatic music)

I want you boys to stay close.

I don't want anybody gettin' lost.

We're all lost.

Yeah but, we're all lost
together. Big difference.

Man, this place is fuckin' creepy.

Yeah, I hate trees.

This ain't so bad.

I grew up in the country.

I bet you did.
(Nick laughs)

I bet you just a regular John-Boy Walton.

Good night, John-Boy. (Laughs)

Yeah. Somethin' like that.

Are there like, any
wild animals out here?

We're in the fuckin'
woods for fuck's sake.

We're surrounded by wild animals.

Punk ass bitch.
Fuck you, man.

You know what the hell I mean.

Cool it, cool it!

Cool it!

There actually are a couple of things

you need to look out for. Me for one.

There's bears, there's
coyotes, there may be snakes.

I knew that shit.

Fuckin' always lookin'
over my shoulder, man.

Lions and tigers and bears, oh my.

Hey.

I think I see something.

Over there.
Civilization.

It's as close as we're
ever gonna get to it.

Come on, let's go.
Whoa! Whoa.

Now look, he last thing we wanna do

is go barreling down there

and have somebody getting
their head blown off.

What you're gonna do is
you're gonna follow me,

and we gonna take it nice and easy.

We don't wanna scare nobody.

Who, us?

Look, I'm not playin' with you, Nick.

And we don't know who's down there.

are, I bet the last thing

they're expecting on their front porch

is four Black dudes from LA.

Not all the sheets there
on the beds are here.

Look, whatever. If you guys
just listen to what I say,

we'll be all right. Let's go.


I think we done found hillbilly heaven.

my neighborhood was bad.

All right guys, chill out.

Remember, we don't wanna
scare these people.

We need their help.

Come on, let's go.
(Eddie coughs)

(Harris knocks on door)


Great, nobody home.

Screw it man, I just say we break in.

Forget, Nick.

Well, excuse me, sir.

I mean we're stranded out here,

what the fuck else we supposed to do?

Yeah, it ain't like we
trying to rob the place

or nothin' like that.

Let's just go inside, use
the phone, and get some help.

We can wait.

Somebody'll be home eventually.

Eventually.

This place looks like a junkyard.

How do we know anybody even lives there?

Well, it's obviously not
abandoned, there's lights.

You guys just hang tight here,

I'm gonna go up the hill and see if I can

signal on this piece of shit.


He ain't gonna get anybody
on that thing, not out here.

I heard that.

Man, it's cold as shit out here!

I heard that too.

I'm not about to sit out
here and freeze my ass off.

So, what you gonna do?

This is some bullshit, man.

I'm 'bout to make myself at home.

Thats what I'm sayin'.

Oh, man.
(instrumental R&B music)

(cell phone beeps)

Middle of no-fuckin'-where.

Fuck!

Hey, where's the light?

Ow, shit!

I'm tellin' you, man,
you guys are goin' too far.

You heard what Redding said,
he's gonna nail you two.

Come on, man, hurry up!


Where's Ray-Ray?

Eddie?
(suspenseful music)


Damn! Where's the light?

(weapon cocks)
Oh, shit.


Damn, you crazy redneck bitch!


Don't even think about it unless

you wanna end up layin'
there with your friend.

Just as easy to have two of your

dead carcasses hauled outta here as one.

Three wouldn't other me none either.

Just calm down for a minute, please.

(coughs and wheezes)

Jesus, he's still alive.

Leave him!

He may be dying.

Listen...

Listen, you're trespassin' on my land.

And that gives you the
right to shoot somebody?

God gave me the right, but
the pleasure was all mine.

Bitch!
(weapon cocks)

Don't say I didn't warn ya.

It will not be like this.


Don't fuck with my kids.

(Ray-Ray coughs)

Damn, way to take care of business, sir!

Y'all talk about
double, just stay still.


[Ray] It hurts!
I know, I know.

What are we gonna do?

Guys, help me get him up, come on, man.

(groans, coughs)

All right, you think you
remember how to get back?

Yeah, I think so, what about you?

I'm gonna hang out here
and check this place out,

look for a phone.

If I can't find one,

I'm gonna go get some help somewhere else,

but, just go, get outta here!

(Ray groans)

All we wanted was to use your phone.


left Mr. Redding back there alone.


He told us to go!

Besides, he can take care of himself.

You saw the way he took
that bitch's head off.

See, that's what I'm talking about, man.

(Ray groans)

What the hell was that?

Damn, it's another gunshot!

There's more bullets flying around here

than in South Central.

Jesus, Mr. Redding,
we gotta go back, man.

Look man, there's nothing
we can do for him now.

You don't know that.

Look, I know I ain't goin' back there.

I hear a gunshot, my ass goes
in the opposite direction.

All right, now let's go.

Miss Martinez, do you think that

the guys are okay out there?

We should've stuck to the road.

Would've been longer, but
it would've been safer.

Think we're gonna be here all night.

That wouldn't surprise me.

Listen, why don't you lie
down and get some rest, okay?

There's no use in both
of us being up all night.

Miss Martinez, I can't sleep.

I know.

Well, why don't we just...
See what's coming.


Hello?

What the hell happened?

Alabama bitch shot him!


Is he okay?


(gasping, wheezing)
(suspenseful music)


Help? Does it look like we got any help?

Shit, we helped get a
bullet put in Ray-Ray's ass.

That's the kinda help we got.

We need some medical
help, we need some guns.

We need the Air Force.

We need the S1Ws!

Where's Redding?

He told us on to on ahead.

He went to look for a phone,
but I don't think he found one.

Damn these woods!


Where's the light?

Where's the light?

Where's the light?

Where's the light?

Where's the light?


The bleeding stopped.

have to get help for him fast.

Well, we sure as hell aren't
gettin' anywhere on this bus.

And Who knows how far
behind us those bastards are?

Let 'em come.

Look, This ain't no time for you

to be gettin' no brass balls.

They probably killed my partner!

They're probably gonna
be killing us next!

Fine, let 'em fucking try!

Look, if that's the way you wanna be...

What are you doing?

I'm taking charge!

What are you, fucking nuts?

Are you?

Miss Martinez, please!
(suspenseful music)

Okay, okay, okay, I'm okay.

It's just that Redding was like my...

What, homie?

Yeah, I know how you feel.

But, right now, it ain't
no time for revenge,

we do that shit later.

Right now, we got to survive.

All right?

Where' s the light? Where's the light?


We've been walking for over an hour,

we've gotta find something soon.

Just keep moving, that's all we can do.

How's Ray-Ray doin'?

up, I'm getting tired.

dude is gettin' heavy.

Yeah, look, we are all tired.

Can't we just stop for a few minutes?

stop right here, all right?


But, just for a few minutes.

Look, why don't you sit down?

You look like you've had it.

(breathes heavily) I ain't stoppin'

till we're out of here.

God, I'm freezing.

Yeah. Can we build a fire please?

How'd I know you'd be
the one to suggest that?

Hey, lay off her, bro.

We all got our skeletons in our closets.

Yeah, and I'm not about to be one.

Look, jackass, we build a
fire, somebody's gonna see it.

Look, if I'm gonna die
out here, I'm dying warm.

Where the fuck are you going?

To take a piss. Is that okay with you?

Hey, look over there. There's a light.

Oh, thank you Jesus! Indoor plumbing.

Look, not so fast.

I'm not walking into
another ambush. Not again.

If we are gonna do this, we do this slow.

I'll take point.

Nick, this is not a game.

I know, that's what I've been saying.

This is war.

(suspenseful music)

What the hell is all this shit?

Look, don't move, all right?

I ain't here to hurt you,

just as long as you don't
give me any problems.

Look lady, we don't want any trouble,

we just need some help for my friend.

Then, you've come to the right place.

You and your friends
are welcome in my home.

Come in, my dear, come in.

You must be cold and tired,

and your friend, better
get him inside too.

(suspenseful music)
(door squeaks on hinges)


I'm Kadja Boszo.

Hi, I'm Denise Martinez.

I am really sorry for breaking
into your house like this,

but, we're desperate.

I understand.

Do you have a phone we could use?

No, I am sorry.

Do you have a car that we
could borrow to get some help?


Look, my boy Ray-Ray's
hurt real bad, all right?

He's gonna die if you
don't get him some help.

Look, can you help him or not?

I can help him if he
wants to stay with us,

or I can help him if he wants to leave.

Either way, I can be of service.

(tribal music)


What is she doing?

I think it's Voodoo.

What?
Voodoo.

What kind of bullshit is that?

people think it can heal.

Yeah, sounds like you're one of 'em.

Listen to me, we don't have
a lot of options right now.

Can you save him?

I can try.

You better do more than just try.

Now who's out of control?

Back up!

That what you're holding is suddenly

getting very heavy, isn't it?

Too much of a burden.

So many people in the
history of this troubled path

have carried its weight.

Put it down, my friend.

Put it down.

Okay, everybody,

just let her work.
(suspenseful music)

(insects chirping)


He's resting.

Is he gonna live or what?

I don't know, it's up to him now.

So much for your black magic.

I knew all that shit was bullshit.


believe in nothing than something.

Yeah, I think I heard that
on a fortune cookie somewhere.

My grandmother used
to believe in Voodoo.

But, she always told me
to stay away from it.

Said the price could be too high and

end up in the wrong hands,
or some shit like that.

She was very wise.

I remember she told me a story once

when I was really young about a spirit.

An evil spirit named "Killjoy."

"Killjoy"? What kind of fucked up

name is that for an evil spirit?

She told me the story
about this boy who turned to

black magic to get revenge on
a gang that was bullying him.

He tried to summon the spirit
of Killjoy, but failed,

and the gang ended up murdering him.

But, that wasn't the end.

Killjoy resurrected the body,
brought him back to life,

and used him to get revenge
by killing the gang.

The boy thought that
Killjoy was serving him,

but in truth, Killjoy was using the boy.

Using him to kill, to get stronger.

Is there supposed to be some
type of moral to this story?

Yeah. Don't be messin'
with this crazy shit.

(eerie music)

Nick, don't wander off.

Look, I need some space, all right?

I'll be back when storytime is over.

It'll be all right.

He's got a lot of anger.

Doesn't everybody?


Man, this is one fucked
up road trip. (Scoffs)

Yeah, you got that right.

I sure could use a hit
of somethin' right now.

Anything to escape this crap.

Let's get some rest, okay?

We'll go for help in the morning.

(clock ticks)

[Nick] Maybe I can help.
You holdin'?

Maybe.

What you got?

Look, first tell me something.

What?

You don't actually
believe that Voodoo bullshit

you were spoutin' off in there, do you?

Yeah, I believe it, I
grew up all around it.

What you gettin' at?

Gettin' at trying to save Ray-Ray.

Wait, are you thinkin'
what I think you're thinkin'?

Look, I'm not just gonna
sit by and let him die.

But, black magic ain't nothing
to be fuckin' around with.

Shit, I will do whatever
it takes to get Ray-Ray back.

Well, I still say you don't
know what you're fuckin' with.

Look, do you wanna get hooked up or not?

Well, what do you
want me to do about it?

I want you to conjure
up that fool, Killjoy.

(suspenseful music)

I'll take care of the rest.

The sun, the moon,
the air, and the light,

we beg you hear our cries tonight.

(wolf howls)

The earth, the soil,
the flesh, and the dust,

we beg you, Killjoy, appear to us.

Come on girl, keep goin'.

The sun, the moon,
the air, and the light,

we beg you hear our cries tonight.

The earth, the soil,
the flesh, and the dust,

we beg you, Killjoy, appear to us.

(dramatic music)


What the fuck's wrong with you?

Ce-Ce?

Damn, are you all right?

I thought you were dead or something.

[Ce-Ce] No, no, I'm fine.


I don't know.

You don't know? What do
you mean you don't know?

Shit, let me tell you then.

Killjoy, your Granny
and her spooky stories,

that crazy witch back
there and her black magic,

it's all bullshit!

I knew it, man, I'm outta here.

Wait!

What about our deal?

You said you could fix me up.

You said you could deliver.

(both sigh)

Well, maybe we could work something out.

What do you say?

They're still not back.

You know, I told them,

I warned them it was dangerous out there.

You're all in danger,
more than you realize.

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about the dark one, Killjoy.

You talking about that story that.

Ce-Ce's grandmother told her?

Yes, I'm afraid so.

What's a fairy tale got to
do with our situation here?

Killjoy's no fairy tale.

He is real and he's coming for all of you.


He's been summoned, I
can feel his presence.

(breathes heavily)


It's Ray-Ray. Something's
wrong, please come, come on.

came alive real fast.

Well, you offered the right incentive.

Yeah.
So, what you got?

Look, about what I said earlier...

Yeah?

I don't know, it's just that...

I don't know, I was just...

Wait! You do have something, right?

You fucking bastard!

You just lied to me so I'd get with you.

You fuckers are all the same.

Look, I lied to save Ray-Ray.

Shit, you weren't
complaining a minute ago.

Whatever! You still lied.


(suspenseful music)

Fucking bastard!


Fuck him, fuck him!
(eerie circus music)

(Killjoy laughs)

I'm back! (Laughs)

Who is that?

Whoo! Feels great! (Laughs)

Hello?

All right Nick, quit fuckin' around.


Nick?

Nick! Oh my God!

(Killjoy laughs and rattles shed)

Who is that?

Oh my God!

I see you in there. (Laughs)

Hello. (Laughs)

(teeth chattering)

(Ce-Ce screams)


Ah!

Ugh!

I hate sloppy seconds.


(Killjoy laughs)

(trees rustling)


(door creaks open)

Where you guys been?

Like I told you, I needed some space.

Where's Ce-Ce?

She's not here with you?

No, I thought she was with you.

Look, I'm not her keeper.

Well, you just left
her there outside alone?

Look, she's a big girl, all right?

She can take care of herself,

I'm not her fuckin' babysitter.

Nick, wait.

Look, I told you I
don't know where she is!

It's not about that, Nick.

It's Ray-Ray.


He's gone.


We took him outside to the barnyard.

Kadja's there with him now.

Why?

I don't know, she
was just goin' on about

we were in danger now.

I think we should all just stay here.

I can't believe you're
listening to that Voodoo bullshit.

That bitch has that you
guys all conned, man.

Nick.

Where you going?

I'm gonna say goodbye to my partner.


Goddamn it.

Miss Martinez, when all of this is over,

are we still gonna have to go
back to the detention center?

I don't know, okay?

What's it matter? Anywhere
is better than here.

Look, you guys,

everything's gonna be okay, all right?

Everybody's gonna come back.

Soon as the sun comes up
I'm gonna go for help, okay?

I still can't believe
anybody lives like this.

No phone, no electricity,
no running water;

it's crazy, it's worse than the ghetto.

To each his own, okay?

Speaking of which, I'm gonna go out to

that pump in the back and get some water.


If she thought it was that dangerous,

would she be out there?

Besides, it's just out back.

She's not responsible
for you guys, I am!

And I think we should all just stay here.

I'll hurry.

(door opens and closes)

(suspenseful music


"Little House on the Fuckin' Prairie."

(water pump squeaks)

Oh no, they got LA tap water out here?

There we go, Beverly Hills tap water.

(Killjoy laughs)
Hello?

(suspenseful music)
Is somebody there?

Ce-Ce. Is that you?

Come on out, girl, Miss
Martinez is gettin' pissed.

Ce-Ce?

Are you in there?

Come on, talk to me, girl.

Ce-Ce?

Oh God, blood! Oh God, oh! (Screams)

(Killjoy laughs)

(water pump squeaks)

(Killjoy laughs)
What the fuck?

Ooh, enough of that.

Put on a happy face, all your troubles

are almost over, for good. (Laughs)

Stay the hell away from me, man.

Ooh, I thought everybody loved a clown.

You come near me, I
swear I'll fuck you up!

Ooh.

Temper, temper my friend.

Here, let me cool you off. (Laughs)

Here it comes. (Oohs and aahs)


You're fuckin' crazy, dude.

think that was funny?

No.

Well, then how about this?
(Eddie grunts)


Now, that's funny. (Laughs)

Whoo, ugh! (Laughs)

(water pump squeaks)


I'm glad you're back.

Ce-Ce hasn't come back yet,
now I'm worried about Eddie.

He left the house?

Yeah. He went to go get some water,

but, he still hasn't come back yet.

I was about to go look for him.

No, you mustn't.

Why not? I mean I just
can't leave them out there.


But, what about the others?

It's too late.

Now what are you sayin'?

I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

Your friends are gone and you will be too

if you leave here, he's waiting out there.

Who?
Killjoy!

Killjoy?

believed in this shit, why?

Why is he coming?

Tell them about it, Nick.

They need to know.
(clock ticks)

What is she talking about, Nick?

Nick?

What?

I was just trying to help Ray-Ray out.

Damn you, Nick!

Look, Ce-Ce and I
went out into the woods,

she did some kind of
ceremony thing, I don't know.

Is that true?

Yeah, but it didn't
work, it was all bullshit.

Yeah, well where is Ce-Ce?

Look, I told you I don't know!

All right, we got into an argument

in the woods and she ran off.

It's the last I saw of her.

Why didn't you say something?

Say what?

You don't actually believe
Killjoy exists, much do you?

I don't know, okay?

All I know is that I
don't know where Ce-Ce is,

and I don't know where Eddie is.

I don't know where they are.

Jesus Christ, Nick.

What, are you trying to get us all killed?

I don't believe in this
Voodoo bullshit anyway.

You know what, man? Fuck y'all.

Wait! We're not gonna split up.

Yeah, Nick, come on,
we need to stay together.

I'm outta here.
(door opens and closes)

Great.

So, what are we gonna do now? Pray?

That sure sounds like a good idea to me.


(insects chirping)
(suspenseful music)

(Killjoy laughs)

Ce-Ce, is that you?

Look, I'm sorry about what
happened earlier, all right?

(Killjoy laughs)

Is that you, Eddie?

Man, ain't no time for your bullshit.

Shit ain't funny, man,
quit clownin' around.

real funny, brother.


What the fuck are you supposed to be?

Me? I'm the one you and
your girlfriend asked for.

She was sweet, by the way. (Laughs)

Man, where is she?

Who, her? I tore off
a piece of that myself.

Several (slurps) pieces. (Laughs)

And now, it's your turn.

Turn for what, man?


Shit, I don't think so,
my circus freak brother.

Oh, don't shoot. No, no, no, no, no, no.

(Killjoy groans)

(laughs, tsks)

What the fuck?


Missed me, missed me, now
you've gotta kiss me. (Kiss)

Fuck it. Guns are for
pussies anyway, man.

I'm gonna cut that fuckin'
smile off your face.

Aw, don't you know a smile is just

a frown turned upside down, huh?

I told you it's time to die.

Here.

Oh?



you fuckin' Bozo wannabe?


I'm not doing anything.

Your life appears to be
in your hands. (Laughs)

Ah!
(Nick grunts)

Oh, that's gotta hurt.

Ooh, ooh, let's give you a
smiley face, come on, come on!

(both shouting)

Ooh, does that hurt? Does it, does it?

Perhaps again.

Ah!
(Nick grunts)

Ooh, are you bleeding, are you bleeding?

Yes you are, good. (Laughs)

How 'bout one more?

Oh, you still have an eye left.

Let me see what I can
do about that. (Grunts)

(Nick grunts)


Oh, come on now baby, smile.

People need to get more
fun out of death. (Laughs)

Lost in darkness, in secrets concealed,

we plead with thee, let truth be revealed.

Lost in darkness, in secrets concealed,

we plead with thee, let truth be revealed.

Lost in darkness, in secrets concealed,

we plead with thee, let truth be revealed.

(suspenseful music)

Lost in darkness...

Are you sure this thing is working?


I can feel him, he is near.

Are you ready>

Yeah, we're ready.

Now you come.

Charlotte, come on,
we have to trust Kadja,

she knows what she's doing. It's okay.


(Killjoy laughs)

What was that?


What does he want from us?

He wants all of us, and
his power is very strong.

(Killjoy laughs)
(skull buzzes)

out, wherever you are. (Laughs)

Shut up, shut up, you shut up!


Mere tricks.

Oh, Killjoy's quite a prankster.

He likes to taunt and tease
before moving in for the kill.

who'll have the last laugh.


I must face him.

You stay here in the
house, you'll be safe.

Listen, I can't let you
go out there all alone.


Listen, Charlotte, you
just stay in the house, okay?

Kadja said it's safe here.

You just find yourself a place to hide.

No. Miss Martinez, what about you?

I'm scared.

I know, I'm scared too.

But, you just stay here, you'll be safe.

We'll be back.

Here, for your protection.

(suspenseful music)

(breathes heavily)

(wind blows)

(Killjoy laughs)

He is near.

You better find a place to hide yourself,

you shouldn't let him see you!

I'll deal with this thing from here.

But...
Go, hide now!


piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy.

Here, piggy. I know
you're out here somewhere.

Hello? Where are you, little piggy?

Come out, come out,
wherever you are. (Laughs)

Come out!
(Denise gasps)

Come on, piggy, don't be a chicken.


Come out little chicken. (Clucks)

All right, time's up, copper!

Where are you?

(breathes deeply)

Lord of the spirits, to you I do call.

Lord of the night, of the
moon, of the stars, hear me!

I was going to save
you for last. (Laughs)

This is going far enough,
I won't let you hurt them!

Well, you know, I've got things to do,

people to kill. (Laughs)

(suspenseful music)


Martinez, it's me, it's me.

Calma, we gotta get out of
here before he comes back.

Where did you go?

Is not important.

Come on, you've gotta
get back in the house.

I know. We gotta get outta
here, come on, let's go.

Let's go.

Get back, you devil,
I'm not afraid of you.

Come on, baby, is that the
best you've got? (Laughs)


Ooh, what was that?

You're on your way to
hell where you belong!

Ooh, hmm.

Well, let's see here.

What shall I wish for?

Why don't you quit while you're ahead?

No! (Screams)
(Killjoy laughs)

(strangles, shrieks)

What are we gonna do?

Lock the door.


Miss Martinez, maybe
everyone is not dead.

Someone could be out there
finding us help right now.


Honeys, I'm home. (Laughs)

What a great spread.

Let me guess, some...

Bed, Bath and Beyond the Grave. (Laughs)

Come on, you sick fuck!

Whoo, oh!

So, you like to play rough, huh?

Good. I like spunky girls. (Laughs)

I'm not goin' down that easy.

Oh, yes you are.


What's that you say?

Can't we all just get along? (Laughs)

Leave me alone, you psycho circus.

a very, very naughty girl,

haven't you, Charlotte?

And we all know what happens
to naughty girls, don't we?

Lord of the black
spirit, to you I do call.

Lord of the night.

Yes, smartass, go ahead, go on.

Lord of the night, of
the moon, of the stars,

hear me,

hear me.

Lord of the night...

Yes, son of night, moon of dark, yeah.

I guess the only question is

how long is this going to take, huh?

As long as it has to.

Oh, that could be a very,
very long time, my child.

You see, I have all of an eternity.

How 'bout you?

Fuck you.

Boring!

Boring!

Boring!

Has anyone ever told you what

an insufferable bore you are, Charlotte?


What about you put down the book,

and I'll give you a 10-second head start.

What do you say, huh?

No?
(Charlotte screams)

Just when our game was
getting so exciting.

Why can't you enjoy yourself, huh?

Leave me alone. (Whimpers)

Why are you doing this to me?


Mr. Redding? (Whimpers)

of the pranksters, child,

that's the oldest trick in the book.

I won't fall for that.

(cocks weapon)
(dramatic music)

What?

You sir,

are not on the guest list!

Daddy's runnin' a little late,

but, this party's 'bout to get started.

Oh finally, someone worth
dropping everything for.

(gasps, whimpers)

Ooh, it's a big gun, I'm scared. (Growls)

What the hell?

it's rude to crash a party?

You know what?

I hate the great outdoors.

And I really fuckin'
hate clowns. Let's go.

Come on, then, come on.

Ha! (Laughs)

You're forcing me to be
rude to my other guests.

They're right over...

Well, they were here just a moment ago.

Take that, you sick bastard.

(Killjoy shouts, flesh sizzles)

You killed my friends, you bastard!

(screams, flesh sizzles)


This party's over, brother.


Mr. Redding, we thought you were dead.

Oh, my God.

Looks like I didn't
make it in time, did I?

(birds chirping)
(indistinct police radio)


Miss Martinez, you're alive.

Oh, I have something to tell you.

Where is he?
Shh, he's gone.

We can go get some help now.

Miss Martinez, you don't even know...

(both gasp)

Harris, I thought you were dead.

I told you I'd be back.

Couldn't leave my girl.

(cell phone rings)

Let's get outta here.

Ma'am, you have a phone call.

Hello?

Mom!

No, I'm okay now.

It is so good to hear your voice.

I'm on my way home now, yeah.

(dramatic music)
(indistinct police radio)

(hip-hop music)

â™« Yeah, yeah, Killjoy, Killjoy two,

â™« Comin' back at ya

â™« (laughs) Watch out
for those clowns, y'all,

â™« Killjoy

â™« All of our lives, we
had to push and fight

â™« Doin' our time and payin' our price

â™« We made some wrong choices,
we made some wrong turns

â™« But, we can't look back
now, why didn't we learn

â™« Why oh, why did it go down like this

â™« We were doin' our time
when we started this trip

â™« And I was taught clowns
supposed to bring us smiles

â™« I never was taught
one could take our lives

â™« Don't ever play with
that old black magic

â™« 'Cause suddenly your life
could end in one big tragic

â™« As soon as love bloomed
and we all became friends

â™« That sick circus clown
would snatch it all to an end

â™« Why, oh why, did it go down like this

â™« We were doin' our time
when we started this trip

â™« And I was taught clowns
supposed to bring us smiles

â™« I never was taught
one could take our lives

â™« We were trying to learn
how to better our lives

â™« Was the beginning to the
end to all of our surprise

â™« We had an addict, nothin',
why, two gang-bangin' thugs

â™« And let's not forget
our little Miss Firebug

â™« Miss Martinez, Mr.
Redding, yeah, they rode too

â™« And that was some of the
whole second Killjoy crew

â™« So, we loaded the bus
and rode on our merry way

â™« For that 200 miles, that 90-day stay

â™« Why, oh why, did it go down like this

â™« We were doin' our time
when we started this trip

â™« And I was taught clowns
supposed to bring us smiles

â™« I never was taught
one could take our lives

â™« Why, oh why, did it go down like this

â™« We were doin' our time
when we started this trip

â™« And I was taught clowns
supposed to bring us smiles

â™« I never was taught
one would take our lives

â™« Killjoy

â™« Killjoy

â™« Killjoy â™«
