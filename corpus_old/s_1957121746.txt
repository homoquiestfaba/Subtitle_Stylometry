[inaudible murmuring]

JJ, you know, Cutter says
he's going to win today.

Cutter who?


Will do.

Thanks, buddy.

Does everything check out?

Yeah, it's checked out.
Just relax.

All right.

Relax.

CUTTER MCCULLOUGH:
You ready for this?

What do you think?

Hey, guys.

JJ SAWYER: Hey, Tammy.

CUTTER MCCULLOUGH: JJ, you're
not taking Hiroto from me.

They're mine.

JJ SAWYER: Yeah?

Why don't we let them decide.

Let's decide right now.

JJ SAWYER: Hey, it's not my
fault you lost everything.

You're going down, JJ.

Save it for the race.

CUTTER MCCULLOUGH:
Yeah, let's do it.

Good luck.

Thanks.

I can't lose, Cliff.

CLIFF: Just relax.

Thanks.

STU: If you win, you're in.

You lose...

Don't make the news.

Let's win this thing.

[ominous music]

ANNOUNCER: JJ Sawyer
moving up in the turn.

So far, he's been holding back.

For a lot of fans
watching today,

this is a two-man
race between Sawyer

and Cutter McCullough
in the pole position.

Best friends from the small
town of Farewell Bend.

They were teammates
until McCullough

split up, making them rivals.

Sawyer pulling in to what
will be his final pit stop.

She doesn't feel right.

Like how?

I don't know.

Sounds like the mix is off.

CLIFF: OK, let's go.

Coming in awful close.

CLIFF: Yeah, I know.

OK, go.

I don't know what's
going on in there, JJ.

Maybe we ought to pull the plug.
No.

Listen to me kid.

I can't promise it won't
blow up in your face.

Button her down.

Do it.

Let's go.
Let's go.

Come on.

ANNOUNCER: It looks
like an exciting finish.

We're coming to
the final two laps.


Cutter.


Hey, aren't you JJ Sawyer?

That's right.


You know, I wrapped
my nose around a power

pole trying to be you.

You're racing again?

No, I just drive
the truck, man.

[music playing]

Fair enough.

Good to see you.

[phone ringing]

What's the good word, Chuck.

CHUCK [OVER PHONE]: Looks
like we need the car a day

earlier than we thought, JJ.

You're kidding me, right?

CHUCK [OVER PHONE]: They jacked
us around on the schedule.

There's nothing I
can do about it.

Any problems, JJ?

Yeah, you know, I've taken
every back road already to make

up time but, hey, no problem.

Unbelievable, unbelievable.

[phone ringing]

Son of a bitch.

[truck honking]

Oh, man.

You all right?

JJ SAWYER: Yeah,
I'd be a lot better

if you were chasing
that son of a bitch

that just ran me off the road.

Hey, aren't you...

Tom Hodges, how
are you doing, JJ?

Long time.

Yeah.

Deputy Hodges.

Well, they call
me Sheriff now.

It's what happens
when you single

handed stop an armed
bank robbery in progress.

Oh, yeah?

You did that?

No, I just ran for
office, and they elected me.

Yours?

Nah, it's a team truck.

Still in racing, huh?

Yeah, just driving.

SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
That's a bad leak.

You want to get that checked.

Yeah, man, I...

I'm just so late already.

Long haul.

JJ SAWYER: You could say that.

Oh, well, then you want to
get your rig checked for sure.

I know just the place.

So, you know, how
long has it been?

Like 10, 15 years?

At least, at least.

Well, he hasn't changed much.

Yeah, I'll bet.

Follow me.

JJ SAWYER: All right, just
keep an eye on me then.

[music playing]

[truck honking]

You want to lift into town?

JJ SAWYER: Nah, nah, I
think I remember the way.

All right, welcome back, JJ.

Thanks.

How you doing?

Hello.

Hello.

[ominous music]

Cutter.


CLIFF: OK, how can I help you?

JJ.

Hey, Cliff.

Well, what do you know.

Well, I know Tom Hodges
has a real sense of humor.

It's good to see you.

You too.

Wow, JJ Sawyer.

What are you doing here?

I took a little
detour off the pavement.

Wow, the great JJ goes
off the outside edge, huh?

It happens, you know.

Yeah, I got power
steering went out on me.

I got a leak anyway.

Maybe check it out.

Power steering.

Hey, Bodie.

Bodie.

Check under that rig
for me, will you?

The power steer...
this is a priority.

Power steering.

Tighten that, would you?

Good place.

Shangri-La, such as it is.

Not the same as
working the crew.

You know, I got off the circuit.

After the accident, I just...

I got my own crew now, and...

got a car in there?

Sure do.

Take a look?

Yeah, sure.

[music playing]

CLIFF: Wow, now that
is a piece of art.

What do you top her out at?

They have guys for that.

Ah, right.

Do you mind?

No, go ahead.

I do miss it.

It still gets my blood up.

Drink?

Ah, I don't know.

Come on.

All right, maybe
I'll have one.

Why not?

Take a load off.

To old friends.

To you.

Oh.

Oh, that's good.

You want to see her?

JJ SAWYER: No, no,
I got a deadline.

Are you sure?

She'd probably like to see you.

How's she doing?

Took her a few years
to get over my brother.

It was a hard time, but, you
know, I was there for her.

You heard about the wedding?

Yeah, congratulations.


JJ Sawyer rolling
into town now.

That is a coincidence.

How's that?

I don't know.

Why not?

Come one, step out back.

Step out back?

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
grab your drink.

I'm not taking no for an answer.

All right.

Where you taking me, Cliff?

Fair is fair, JJ.

You showed me yours.

I'll show you mine.

But before we do...

Yeah, all right.

I'm glad I'm walking, all right.

Wait for it.

I'm waiting.

Wait for it.

[ominous music]

Yeah, you're not dreaming.

That's really it.

That's Cutter's car.

I rebuilt it myself.

Yeah, I made a few
changes here and there.

You know, make it
good for the street.


I only just finished
it, and you show up.

Tammy doesn't even
want to look at it.

I'm out of here, Cliff.

You know, it's strange, huh?

I mean, I finish
it, and you show it.

What do you suppose that means?

Doesn't mean anything.

CLIFF: No, it does.

It does, JJ.

It can't be a coincidence.

This is fate talking.

JJ, listen to me.

Nobody was supposed
to get hurt, OK?

It was Cutter, and
he put me up to it.

Put you up to what?

You car, we sabotaged it.

I mean, he needed his
sponsors, all right?

He needed... he needed Hiroto.

You sabotaged my car.

Son of a bitch.

Ah.

Cutter had something on...

on one of your pit boys.

TAMMY: Hey, hey, what in
the hell is going on here?

What are you doing here?

I'm sorry.

You OK?

You all right?
Ah.

What happened?

[ominous music]

Do the best you can.

[ominous music]

Hey, we need a car.

Some drinking and fast driving
will make you feel better.

That trucker really
kill your dad?

How would I know?

Hey, maybe we should
get him to kill mine.


Oh, ow.

Show some respect, dude.

I think I'm in love.

[ominous music]

How you doing?

Hey.

Hey, give me your lager.

[phone ringing]

BARTENDER: There you go

Thanks.

OWEN: [inaudible] Oh, god.

OK, wait.

You got to help me.

If you bleed on me,
I'll kick your ass.

I got my ass kicked
by a girl, man.

You did.

Whoa, check it out.

Whoa, dude, that is sick.

Oh, man.

Let's have some fun.

Let's do this.

Check the trunk for a six pack.

See if it's our lucky day.

I will.

Yeah, woo.

OWEN: Oh.

It's roomy in here, man.

Seat belts and everything.


[car revving]

Taz.

Hi, how can I help you?

I'm supposed to
fill out a form.

JJ, come on in.

It's OK.

You made it.

Yeah.

SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
The state police

caught your friend
in a speed check

before he ended up
killing somebody.

That's good.

SHERIFF TOM HODGES: Yeah,
what happened to your hand?

JJ SAWYER: Oh, I stuck it
where it didn't belong.

How's your rig?

JJ SAWYER: Well, I think I
might need a new mechanic.

Oh, Cliff's the best, JJ.

He's good people.

You fill out this part.

JJ SAWYER: All right.

Sign it there.

You were the first
citation I ever wrote out.

You and Cutter back when
you were both hell raisers.

You didn't have any
time for me, and I

guess I rode you too hard.

You know what, Tom?

I'd rather not reminisce.

Fair enough.

I used to drive out to Craig
Loop and see your folks a lot.

They were always
talking about you.

Oh, JJ is going to come
back home real soon.

Here you go.

Filled it out.

Signed it.

You can write it up
any way you want.

What's your rush?

Hey, what do you
want from me, Tom?

So I didn't show
up for the funeral.

That's between me and
them, and my maker.

SHERIFF TOM HODGES: Right, you
quit on everybody, didn't you?

Let me tell you something.

Nobody blamed you
for that accident.

You did that yourself.

The town lost a hero that day.

It didn't need to lose two.

You could learn
something from Cliff.

So could you, Tom.

TAMMY: Compliments
of the management.

It's parked out on Main.

So what happened back there?

Nothing.

TAMMY: Funny, that's
what Cliff said.

So you just knock out your
old friends for the fun of it.

Look, it was my fault, OK?

Some hello after 17 years.

Hello, Tammy.

You look great.

Oh, gee, thanks.

So do you.

What are you doing here, JJ?

Leaving.

No, you already did that.

Talk to me.

What do you want me to say?

I don't know.

Stick around for a while.

You'll think of something.

There's nothing
for me here, Tam.

Thanks for the truck.

It's good seeing you again.

[music playing]

[air hissing sound]

JESSE: Hey, let me go.

Let go of the can.

Hey.

Let go of the can.

Now, why did you have
to go and do that, huh?

Freedom of expression.

Oh, yeah?

Hey, put me down.

I will scream rape.

You start screaming, Picasso.

Hm, you keeping
busy, huh, Jess?

JJ SAWYER: Yeah,
painting my truck.

I though you'd be
long gone by now.

Same here.

What's your excuse?

One of the perks of the job.

I see your canvases are
improving, young lady.

Nothing personal, but it means
we don't have to clean it up.

Yeah, well, somebody has to.

Take it up with her mother.

[phone ringing]

[music playing]

[inaudible slurring]

No more of this crap.

I should have buried
you a long time ago.

[rattling noises]

Come on, Jesse.

Let's go.

You?

It's great having
you back, JJ.

[music playing]

This is nuts.

tear your guts out, and then

I'm going to crush you.

[humming noise]

Cutter?

You sure do pick
your spots, don't you?

Look who's talking.

Look, Jess,
Sheriff Hodges is not

going to keep doing us favors
just because he's a friend.

Whatever.

What do you want from me?

I want you to think
about what you're doing.

OK, all right.

I want you to be responsible.

Oh, yeah.

Like hanging out at speed
ways and partying and getting

knocked up.

Jess, I want you to
do better than me, OK?

Yeah, you wouldn't want
me repeating your mistake.

That's not what I said.

Yes, it is.

[music playing]

[car revving]

[knocking on door]

DEPUTY JACKSON: Sawyer.

What's up?

Do you mind opening your
trailer for me, please?

What for?

Just open it.

Great.

Knock yourself out.

I need you to do it.

Anything in particular
you're looking for?

Yes, sir.

A head.

[music playing]

OFFICER: I'm just going to
need you to stay right here.

SHERIFF TOM HODGES: Robbery.

He shows up, tries to stop it.

Then they cut
his head off, yeah.

Unless they took the car
to make us think a robbery.

Then they meant to kill him.

Yeah.

Who'd have it out for Cliff?

And want to cut off his limbs.

Listen, I got
Sawyer inside waiting.

Good, thanks.

She's going to take
your statement.

You mind telling me
why I'm sitting here?

SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
You don't know?

No, all I know is
one of your deputies

came sniffing around my
truck looking for a head.

It seems that
Cliff has lost his.

His head?

Yeah, I hear you two had
a real knockdown drag out.

JJ SAWYER: Yeah,
yeah, but when I left,

his head was firmly
attached to his shoulders.

You can ask Tammy.

Does she know?

She found the body.

Oh my God, I got to see her.

Not so fast.

Come on, Tom.

Now, why would I
do that to Cliff?

Why?

Come on.

SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
You know the story, JJ.

It's practically a
legend around here.

Yeah, well, in case
you've forgotten,

I'm the one that lived it.

Now, if anybody was out
for revenge after 17 years,

it would be him.

Not me.

SHERIFF TOM HODGES: So
Cliff wanted revenge.

JJ SAWYER: I said if.

All he wanted was
to show me his car.

That is a real coincidence,
wouldn't you say?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, that'll be real
neat, wouldn't it, Tom?

Every legend needs it's bad guy.

Well, I know you're
a quitter and a loser.

I just wondered how
far you'd fallen.

Sir.

What you got, Ron?

Besides the obvious?

Yeah.

Vehicle went over
him post-mortem.

You mean they cut his head
off and then drove over him?

Mm.

Man, that's mean.

Mhm.

I make the time of death
approximately 9:00 PM.

9 o'clock last night.

Are you sure about that?

Yeah, give or take.

OK, thank you.

What's wrong?

Well, JJ was in our office
at 9 o'clock last night.

OK.

[ominous music]

What could I have
learned from Cliff

that I don't already know?

That I didn't do it.

I didn't kill him.

I can't ask him
that, but in my office

you said I could learn
something from Cliff.

Would you care to
be more specific?

You can go.

They sabotaged my car.

Cliff and Cutter.

That's what caused the accident.

Cliff told me.

That's why we got into it.

Sounds a lot like a motive.

I didn't do it.

Go now.

JJ SAWYER: Well,
there's something else.

The car.

What about it?

JJ SAWYER: It's crazy, but
when Cliff showed me that car,

it was like Cutter
was still in it.

Like he never left
after the accident.

You better get out of here.

[ominous music]

Now, I got you.


JESSE: You're never
honest with me.

You just say what you
think I want to hear.

How many of many of my dads do
you have to kill anyway, huh?

Tammy, it's JJ.

Tammy.

Say, what happened?

They took his head, JJ.

Now, Jesse's like a complete
alien, and I don't know.

I don't know.

I mean, maybe this is it.

This is where I lose her
forever too, you know?

No, don't say that.

My family is breaking
into a thousand pieces, JJ.

And you are in the
middle of it again.

Why?

I mean, why are you here?

Why did you come back?

Why?

Why?

Why, JJ?

[music playing]

39-2 to station.

I'm in pursuit of
a custom race car.

No plates.

Location is the
Peacock Lumber Yard.

Copy that.

Who's ever driving that
car is our prime suspect.


I mean, we had a
good marriage, mostly,

I mean, until all his pain
finally caught up with him.

I think Cutter was
Cliff's only gravity.

Then he just started
drinking more and more

and obsessing on that car.

Then all this stuff with Jesse.

I just thought we were going
to get through it, you know?

Has it really been 17 years?

Yep.

And how about you?

You tore yourself up
with guilt, didn't you?

JJ SAWYER: You know, Tom
Hodges thinks I did it.

Your kid thinks I did it.

Who would do
something like this?

How long has Cliff
been working on that car?

I don't know.

A year, maybe.

Why?

Did he ever say
anything to you about it,

about anything that sounded
maybe a little strange.

No, he didn't say anything
to me about it after I told him

I wanted to see it crushed.

JJ SAWYER: Well, when
he showed me the car,

I got a weird feeling.

Feeling?

JJ SAWYER: Like
something was in it.

Something like what?

Like Cutter.

Like he never left it.

Like... like he was
really pissed off.

Like a ghost?

And you think that this
ghost is what killed Cliff?

Might be.

My god, you're insane.

No, Tammy, come on.

I...

No, JJ, get out.

JJ SAWYER: Look, Tammy...

JJ, get out.

[ominous music]

Oh.

[radio chatter]

[music playing]

[phone ringing]

[screeching car sounds]

[phone ringing]

Yeah, I got a
little hung up, Chuck.

I'm on my way.

CHUCK [OVER PHONE]: On your way?

You got to be here already.

JJ, do I have to
spell it out for you?

Your job is riding on this.

Yeah, not any clearer
than you already have, man.

Asshole.

[banging noises]

[music playing]

OK, OK, OK.

JJ SAWYER: Comfy up there?

Crucify me later, dude.

I seriously have to pee.

Here, use this.

Yeah, right.

I just love burgers.

You know, I could eat
burgers every day.

If I had to get a job,
I'd get a job at Mickey

D's just for the burgers.

Yeah, well,
finish it up quick.

You know, I didn't expect
you to dive off like that.

Yeah, well, you
could've said something.

Yeah, and I could have emptied
my bladder in your truck too,

but I didn't.

I was tempted.

Hey, you know, I don't
need this right now, kid.

OK?

I got enough problems of my own.

If I don't get that
car delivered on time,

I'm going to be serving
fries at Mickey D's.

Just think of the discount.

Call your mom.

No way, I'm not
going back there.

Where do you
think you're going?

Well, I don't know.

I could stay with
you for a while.

You know, just until I
figure something else out.

And how would
that work exactly?

Oh, right.

I guess not with you
killing my two dads and all.

Look, your mom...

My mom.

Hey, listen to me.

Your mom needs you right now.

You're all she's got,
and I'm taking you there.

So let's go.

No way... give me that.

Hey, that is good stuff.

Hey, just come on.

Let's go.

You know, you
don't need to take

me to wherever you're
going, just drop me off

at San Francisco or something.

Get real.

[car revving]


Come on.

That was my dad's car,
and there was no one in it.

Just get in the truck.

SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
Call the state police.

Let them know.

TAMMY: Tom.

I don't have time
right now, Tammy.

Jesse's missing.

She never came home last night.

I've already checked all the
usual places, and, you know,

she was so upset
about Cliff, and...

what?

SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
Do you know if she

went off with Taz or Owen?

Maybe, why?

Because somebody
found Taz this morning.

He was dead.

Owen?

SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
They're looking.

No.

SHERIFF TOM HODGES: But
there's been no sign of Jesse,

so she's probably
still all right.

Probably?

We'll do everything
we can to find her.

You know that.

But right now, I have a
murder spree on my hands,

and my only suspect
has left town

in the middle of the night.

JJ?
Yeah.

TAMMY: You know, he was saying
some really crazy things

yesterday.

SHERIFF TOM HODGES:
I know what he said,

and I should've locked him
up when I had the chance.

What if she's with him?

Then we'll bring her back.

I'm going with you.

I don't think that
would be a good idea.

Tom Hodges, I'm
going with you.

I don't see it.

It tried to kill us.

Jess, we're safe
inside this truck, OK?

It can't get us in here.

Oh, I'm freaking
out right now.

JJ SAWYER: Yeah?

Join the club.

OK, there was no
one driving the car.

Whatever's in that car
is after me, not you.

Oh, yeah.

It took out half the market
trying to make us road kill,

but it's only after you.

Is that what happened to my dad?

Oh, great.

Frankencar, it's alive.

You know, I liked it better
when I thought you did it.

The car is haunted, isn't it?

How would I know?

It's my first Frankencar too.

Is it Cutter?

I know he's my real dad.

They told me.

Is it him?

I don't know what it is.

I don't.

Come on, everyone knows you
two were like mortal enemies.

It's just a story.

I mean, it's something
they cooked up just to hype

the races.

Really?

JJ SAWYER: Yeah, Cutter and
me, we used to race around,

you know, knock over a
mailboxes, chase girls.

I mean, all the
stupid stuff guys do.

Some guys.

I mean, we did.

Cutter and me, we were friends.

Was he like you?

Like me?

Am I like him?

No, you're like your mother.

Ouch, right between the eyes.

And you asked for it.


Well, speaking of your mother.

Well, this out to be good.

What's going on?

SHERIFF TOM HODGES: Get out, JJ.

Hands behind your head, now.

JJ SAWYER: All right,
take it easy, Tom.

Up against the truck.

Out of the way, Jesse.

What?

Up against the truck.

What are you doing?

Jesse.

Hey, I was bringing
her back, Tammy.

It's not his fault.

SHERIFF TOM HODGES: You're
lucky you didn't harm her.

We'd be doing this
Old Testament style.

You're making a mistake.

Yeah?

The only mistake I made
was letting you walk

away, you murdering psychopath.

It was the car, Tom.

Enough of the damn car.

JESSE: He's telling the truth.

No, it was dad's car.

It was his racer.

I saw it, and it
tried to kill us.

JJ SAWYER: Will you
listen to her, Tammy?

Stop it.
He didn't do anything to me.

He didn't do anything wrong.
TAMMY: Jesse, stop it.

Jesse.

JESSE: Stop it, let go of me.

Let go of me.

Hey, Tom.

She's telling the truth.

I'm telling you the truth.

All right, let's do this.

[music playing]

Get in.


Tammy, Jessie, come on.

Come on, let's go.

Get in the truck.

JESSE: No, we can't leave her.
Just get in the truck.

Come on.

DEPUTY MONROE: I'm stuck.

Pull my arm.

OK, I'm going to
get you out of there.

I'm going to pull
your other leg.


Where'd it go?

I don't know.

It's gone.

Again.

JJ SAWYER: Yeah, again.

Look, I'm sorry I didn't
believe you earlier.

It's all right.

I didn't believe
me at first either.

I mean, really?

It was this car
that killed Cliff?

It's haunted, mom.

Yeah, that's impossible.

Duh, but this guy's
too nice to say it

even though he pretends
to be a jerk face.

That car is coming after him
and everyone gets in its way.

And what?

It's haunted by Cutter?

Why would he kill
his own brother?

Ghost, undead, evil.

Look, the important
thing is that we

get somewhere safe, all right?

I can't find my cellphone.

Let me use yours.

I don't have one.

JJ SAWYER: Well, I
know you've got one.

JESSE: No, no, that privilege
was recently suspended

for unspecified reasons.

Oh, you think
maybe your behavior

had something to with it?

All right, all right.

Hey, forget about
the cell phone.

Well, what about this?

Breaker, breaker, 10-4.

Give me that.

Give me that.

Breaker, breaker, we got
an emergency situation.

Anybody out there?
Come back.

[radio crackling]

Anybody out there?

[radio crackling]

We're in the middle of nowhere.


You shut up.

You got all the lingo.

You got all the moves, you know.

You can have my job
now that it's open.

Oh, forget it.

Who wants to drive a truck?

JJ SAWYER: Oh, you
got something better?

Anything.

All right, go ahead.

Name it.

Oh, makeup.

Makeup?

You mean like selling lipstick?

No, no, not what
they sell at the malls.

You know, like... like
your fashion shows

and shoots and stuff like that.

JJ SAWYER: Yeah, that's good.

I hear they make good money.

Yeah, they do.

It's a serious profession.

You know, there's lots of
schools for it and stuff.

Yeah, that's good.

That's good.

Whatever.

You handled that
well back there.

She likes you.

Well, no accounting
for good taste.

Look, I just learned more
about my own kid in this truck

than I have in the past year.

You know, I caught her
up there in the sleeper.

She's got a lot of questions
about her dad, but I was...

I was good.

I... you know...

I made it sound like Cutter
and I were good friends, and...

Yeah, I didn't talk to
her about Cutter much.

It was just too hard.

What about you?

What about me?

Do you have any questions?

Questions about what?

Well, maybe why I went
with him and not you.

Because you loved
him more, right?

No, are you kidding?

Cutter was a mean guy.

All he cared about was himself.

I've had a long time
to think about this.

You were a good guy.

Cocky, but you were
better than most of them.

I just couldn't handle it.

Pretty lame, I know.

So what did Cliff say to you?

He said that you and
Jesse kept him going.

[beeping sound]

Why are we slowing down?

Believe me, kid.

It's not by choice.

What do you think it is?

I don't know,
but it's not good.

Now what?

Now, I go check underneath.

Well, I'm getting out.

No.

No, you're not.

JESSE: Oh, like
sitting here's really

going to stop a majorly
pissed off ghost from getting

its eternal revenge.

Don't you guys watch movies?

I got a life.

You mean a truck, and some
really smelly socks and a...

Cool it, Jess.

Look, you can get out but
stay close to the truck.

Yeah, keep your eyes peeled.

That's all I'm saying.

[ominous music]

Well?

I don't see anything.

Transmission?

Yeah, I'm afraid it might be.

Figure it's toast?

This baby's not
going anywhere.

Well, how about we just take
a nice walk through the middle

of nowhere, huh?

Hello?

You've got a race
car in the back.

You were never like her
when you were her age.

No, she gets the
attitude from her dad.

Probably be needing this.

You know, she's
just like her father.

She's just like you JJ.

[music playing]

What?

I really screwed things up.

So Jesse's mine?

She's my kid?

You know something, lady?

Your timing sucks.

You know that?

Sucks.

Yeah, well this might be the
last chance I have to tell you.

[ominous music]

[ominous music]

All right, Jesse,
come on, let's go!

Jesse!

Jess!

[suspenseful music]

[crows cawing]



Let me go!


[engine revving]

Jess!

Jesse!

TAMMY: Jesse!

Jesse!

Jesse!

Jess!

Jess!

[engine revving]


Jess!

Is she driving the car?

No, she's not.

I'm a little rusty.

Hang on.

[Tyre screech]

No!

No!

Stop!

Stop!

Stop!

This is what he wants, me
chasing him one more time.

But why?

To get back at me
for what happened.

It was an accident.

Yeah.

It was an accident, wasn't it?

There are no accidents, Tammy.

What happened?

What happened, JJ?

He did something, didn't he?

Cutter did...

It doesn't matter right now.

Well, yes, it does!

No, all that matters is
that we get our daughter back.

What do you want from me?


You're not my father!

You are never my father!

I hate you!

You hear me?

What if we don't catch it?

We will.



Where is it?

No, no!

I hate you!

I hate...


Let me out!

You hear me?

Let me out!

Stop!

Stop!

He knew Jesse was yours.

[music playing]

Stop!


[Tyre screech]


It's going home.

We may have a shot here.

How?

There it is!

Come on, faster!

God, we're never
going to catch them.

Not like this.

God, he's going to kill her.


Not while I'm
still on this Earth.

Now what are you doing?

What are you doing?

Getting out.

No...

You gotta trust me on this.

It's all right.

Mom?




I'm trapped!

Help!

I'm going to get you
out of there, Jess!

Kick it!

Kick the windshield!

Harder!

Come on, kick it!



JJ!

Stay there.
It's OK.

Jesse?

I'm OK, too.

[engine revving]

All right, what
are we going to do?

I got a plan.

Oh, yeah, right.

Here's the plan.

I'm going to run
as fast as I can.

You get you and your
mother out of here.

Can you handle that?
Sure, sure.

But what about you?

I mean, that car won't
stop for anything.

That's what I'm counting on.

Listen, you tell
your mom I think she

did a great job raising you.

Three dead dads.

That's got to be
a record, right?

That ain't going to happen.

Go.

[suspenseful music]

[engine rumbling]

[engine growling]

Come on, you son of a bitch.

Sweet!


I thought I told
you to get lost.

So you really did have a plan.

You did it!

Yeah, this used to
be my favorite hiding

spot when I was a kid.

Used to go skinny
dipping right out there.


OK, you know what?

I have had enough
horrors for today

without adding that image.

Yeah.


OK, all right, now
that we're all here,

I have some questions.

She knows.

She knows?

Don't look at me.

Oh, yeah.

Lots of questions.

Yeah, well, you know, there's
plenty of time for questions...

Ah, no, uh-uh.

You not getting off that easy.

[eerie music]


No!

It can't!

All right, get in the car.

Get in the car!

[cricket chirping]

It'll never stop.

It'll just keep
coming and coming.

It's pretty clear
I'm the one he wants.

I need you two away from me.

I mean, we can't just
leave you here, JJ.

Yeah?

What are you going to
do to help me, Tammy?

I mean, your ex-boyfriend
is a freaking demon!

And what are you going to do?

You're just going
to keep running,

what, till you run out of gas?

And then what?

You got a better plan?

Because if you do, I'm all ears.

I mean, let's say
he does get you.

I mean, how do we know he's not
going to keep coming after us?

Right, because you
think he only wants you.

We need to find a
place a car can't go.

Jesse, that car
drove out of the lake.

JJ SAWYER: Hey,
she's got a point.

I mean, that car may be
haunted, but it's still a car.

Dude, that car is alive.

JJ SAWYER: Yeah.

So that means there's gotta
be some way to kill it.

Whoo-wee!

Look at that!

Don't get to meet a race
car stopping around here.

Whoo!

It's nice.

You folks in an
accident or something?

Yeah, you could say that.

Is that yours over there?

Yeah.

Mind if I borrow the keys?

What?

Now.

Or you're going to be sorry
than you could possibly imagine.

Look, mister.

I think you folks
might need some help.

Give me the keys.

Don't bother calling the Sheriff
because he's already dead.

You're going to get these
back, I promise you.

I'll go get a truck...

JJ...

...and I want you to
drive as far as you can,

and then drive some more.

JJ, how

It doesn't matter.

Just be safe, OK?


Hey, hey hey, hey.

It's OK.

It's OK.

You're tougher than all of us.

No.

Look, Jess, you know, I
wasn't there for you growing up.

But I can do this.

You just have to let me, OK?

Now go.

Come on.

Sorry I tagged your truck.

Next time I'm
pressing charges.

Get in!

Jerk-face.

Hey!

Not so fast, mister!

OK?

Now don't try anything funny.

JJ SAWYER: Wouldn't think of it.

You said you shot the Sheriff?

No.

And I didn't shoot
the deputy either.

I said nothing funny!

So why are you so bloody, huh?

What happened to the Sheriff?

I said, what happen
to the Sheriff?

All right, OK.


Go!

TAMMY: Oh, God.

JJ, it's too late!
Great.

Son of a bitch!

Hey, run!

Get out!

What?

Get going!
Get going!

You heard me!

OK!

[suspenseful music]

[Tyre screech]

[engine rumbling]

[gun firing]

Back, get back!


Jesse?
Yeah.

You all right?

I'm OK.

I'm all right.

[engine rumbling]

No.

No, no.

It's impossible!

Go on.

Get back in the truck.



[engine rumbling]

Hey, how are you doing?

How can we do it, huh?

How could we just
leave him like that?

Baby, JJ's got a plan.

You mean the plan
that you did somewhere

out there on the road?

Hey, don't give
up on him yet, OK?

Like you did?

Yeah, like I did.

I like him, mom.

So do I.


It's OK.

All right, old buddy.

Catch me if you can.

[engine revving]

Come on.

Oh, my God!

Come on, you son of a bitch!

[Tyre screeching]

Where did you go?



[engine starting]

Come on!



Cutter.



[engine starts]

You made it.

Longest 15 minutes of my life.

Jesse?

She's not here.

She's safe.

She's a great kid.

She really is.

You're ready for this?

Because he's coming.

You better believe it.

I haven't seen that
look in a long time.

Come on, let's do this.

[engine revs]

Come on.

JJ, there's something wrong!

What are you doing?

No!

JJ, I don't know
what's going on!

I can't stop it!

Don't get out.

[engine revs]

No, JJ!

Don't do it!

I got to do this!

I got to end it!

[suspenseful music]

[engine revs]



Yes!

Ugh!

Get off of my dad.

Yeah.

Right.

[exhales deeply]

I think it's over, guys.

Anybody?

Uh.
No.

No, thank you.

Let's get out of here.

[eerie music]
