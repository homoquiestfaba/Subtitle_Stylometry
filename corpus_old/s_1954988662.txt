[Woman screaming]


[Man crying]

Jesus.

Oh, Jesus.


Fucking monster!

Just let us go.
Just let us go.

[Man speaking in Russian]

Why are you doing this?

Oh, God.


Just let me go.

Let us go, please.

Shit.

What are you doing?

What is that?
What is that?

What are you doing?

No, no, no.

What... what is it?

Where are you going?

What are you doing?

[Man coughing]

Shelly, I can't see you.

I can't see you.
I can't see you.

I can't see you.

She did not respond favorably
to the formula.

Such a pity.

I'm afraid...

Your wife's heart
couldn't take it.

Her heart just burst

From the intense
blood pressure.

You sick fuck.

I swear to God,
I swear to God,

I'm gonna fucking kill you.

I'm gonna fucking kill you!

Wait, wait, wait.

Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

Wait, my daughter.

What about my daughter?

Where's my daughter?
Where's my daughter?

Where is she?
Where is she?

What did you do to her?

You need not be concerned.

Please.

Who the fuck
are you?

Who are you?

Why are you
fucking doing this?

Do not think me a madman.

While the rest of the world

Will soon regard me

As a liberating angel,

Your destiny

Is to become the carrier
of a plague so deadly

That your cities will succumb
within days,

Your country within weeks,

As a harbinger of death,

Which your capitalist society
truly deserves.

Don't do this, please.

You don't have to do this.

Please don't.

You're fucking insane.

Please, please,
you don't have to do this.

Please, please.

Once the outbreak has spread,

The whole world will isolate

And contain your borders.

Perhaps it will spread
to Mexico.

Oh, God.

Canada?

Unlike the failures

Of my past, this time,
I'm confident I will succeed.

Please stop.

Oh, yes, yes.

There will be the side effects,
of course:

The unnatural, uncontrollable,
random bone growth,

Lesions and ulcers
of the epidermis,

Increased salivation,

And then rage will set in,

Insane rage,

And finally...

The bloodlust.

Please don't.

Please don't do this.

No.

I will be quick.

After all,
I am not a sadist.

No, no, no, no,
please don't.


Oh, my God!

God has nothing...
Nothing to do with this!

Try not to move.

Oh, no, no, no, no.

[Blade whirring]


[All yelling]

[Electricity zapping]

Subject's metamorphosis
is near completion.

Rage is coursing
through his veins.

Your thirst for my blood

Is becoming insatiable,
unquenchable.

[Screaming and growling]

Rage!

Rage is perfection.

Looks like the ecstasy
they took finally kicked in.

Holy shit.

Look at them.

They're practically fornicating

In public.

I guess you weren't kidding

When you said
Olivia goes both ways.

Look at her working it.

Yeah, but I've
never seen Kat act

That whacked in the head.

She must be stoned
out of her mind.

I'd better stop this,
or she'll never forgive me.

Pris, think about it.

Kat is old enough
to do whatever she wants.

You're not her keeper.

No, I'm not,

But I'm her best friend.

And if you want
to keep it that way,

Sit back
and leave her alone.

How can I?
I mean, look at her.

She's obviously
so messed up,

She doesn't even know

What she's doing.

What if she does?

Look, if Kat and Josh want
to sexually experiment,

Let them.

It's not that big
of a deal.

And they're only going
to resent you for it

If you try to stop them.

I've known Kat
for 20 years.

I've never seen her act
like that before.

Well, maybe she has...
Just not with you.

Let it go.

Besides, you got me,

And I am a trisexual.

What does that mean?

It means I will try
anything you want me to.


*

So how are you feeling, Kat?

Fucking amazing, man.

This shit is intense.

It's like magic,
isn't it?

I've saved these hits
for a long time

For just the right occasion.

And tonight's the night.

What do you say, baby?

Let's make some memories.

Let's make the whole night
of those moments.

The three of us,

We'll make the kind of night
we'll all never forget.

Hell, yeah, I'm down.

Shit, we could all
be dead tomorrow.

Let's live.

*

[Light rock music]

*

[With English accent]
You love it, don't you?

Oh, baby, harder.

You are,
without doubt,

One piece of exquisite
fucking ass.

Oh, God, I love
your sexy James Bond accent.

That's right, baby.

I'm the commander.

Shaken, not stirred.

[Twig snaps]

Hold on.
Hold on.

Baby, I'm almost there.

Shh.

What is it?

It's nothing.

Why do you always
pick these goddamn spots

In the middle of nowhere?

After that time your old man

Nearly caught us
in the El rey motel,

I'm not taking
any more chances.

Why the hell did you
have to bring him up?

Shh.
Forget about him.

You're with a real man now.

Who's the commander,
you slapper?

That's right, baby.

You are the commander.

Who's the commander?

Fuck me off.

Oh, yeah, baby.

You are.

Harder, harder, harder.

Harder, harder.

Fuck me!

[Both screaming]



[Echoing scream]

* when you wake up
in the morning *

* and the light
is shining through *

* and you see
the dead man reachin' *

* and reachin' out for you...

*

Ooh, damn!

I want to lick you
in places

You haven't washed yet.

That's right.

Don't be shy, sweetheart.

Let's see 'em.

Show us your tits.

Come on.

A little more.
A little more.

Oh, man!

Oh, yeah, right, okay.

Get in that winnebago.

Man.

Wild thing,
how you doing this morning?

You look miserable.

Good morning.

Hey.

Where'd Kat go?

I don't know.

Probably back
to the winnebago

To use the bathroom
or something.

Is she coming back?

Why?

What do you have in mind?

You know, I have
this problem.

I'm always horny as hell
when I wake up.

What are you gonna do
about it?


Oh, my... you just...

You just fucking
puked on me.


What happened to you?

I don't want
to talk about it.

I just have to use
your bathroom.

Oh.


[Bird shrieks]

[Suspenseful music]

*

[Birds screeching]

Do you two know why
this pond is so special?

No.

Is it magical?

Well, yeah.

I guess in a way,
it is, sweetheart.

You see,
a long, long time ago,

Your great-great-granddaddy
brought your grandpa here

And taught him how to fish.

A few years after that,

Grandpa brought your daddy
and I here

And taught us
how to fish.

I hope that when
you're all grown up

And have your own children,

You'll bring them here too,
teach them.

Yeah, it can become
a family tradition.

I don't like the worms;
They're icky.

Yeah.

Uncle Ben,
why'd daddy have to die?

Your daddy loved you a lot.

He still does.

He's just up in heaven now.

I miss him a lot.

I think mommy does too.

Of course
she does.

I do too.

You know, he always wanted
to bring you out here one day.

I'm doing this
for him.

That's why I brought you
out here; Do you understand?

Uncle Ben?

I have to go to the bathroom.

Uh-oh.

Well, do you have to go
number one or number two?

One.

Okay, okay.

You see those bushes
right over there?

You just go down
behind those bushes

And go ahead and potty.

Ew, I don't want
to go out here.

Isn't there a bathroom around?

Don't be a baby, sadie.

No, no, honey,
there's no bathroom.

Okay?

If you want to go potty,
you just have to go

Behind those bushes
and just go potty, okay?

And now,
here's a tissue for you.

Just go, already.

You're scaring away the fish.

Take galeppy.
Okay.

Watch your step.

All right, now,
you hurry on back, okay?

And you watch out
for poison Ivy.

I don't like this,
not one bit.

[Bird squawking]

[Rock music]

Hey, Jay.

How long has pris known Olivia?

Um, I don't know...
A few months, maybe,

Ever since Olivia
started working with her

At dimski records.

Why?

Dude, she's fucking hot.

Total boner material.

You have no argument here.

I feel like such an asshole
for puking on her, though.

Yeah, I know what you mean.

I'd feel like a asshole too

If I just puked all over a girl
I had a menage a trois with.

Fuck you.

I'm embarrassed enough already.

You know what frightens me?

Kat was into it more than I was.

Dude, you should have seen
the two of them going at it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.

Me and pris went over there

And watched for a while.

Yup, took some video.

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
downloaded it on the Internet.

Bullshit.
No, you didn't.

It made Paris Hilton famous,

Pamela Anderson,

Tommy Lee.

No, I mean it.

There was something strange
about last night.

It freaked pris out too.

I mean, she's been best friends
with Kat forever.

But it was weird.

I can't tell if she's mad

At Kat for what she did
or jealous

That Kat never came on to her.

Uncle Ben, I'm bored.

Really?

Well, we just got here.

I want to go home and play
the new Xbox you bought us.

Well, we're only
gonna be here

Another hour or so.

What's your favorite game?

Star wars.

Star wars.

How about that other game
I got you, phantasm?

I like that too,

But mom took it away
because it was too scary.

Too scary?
She did, huh?


Sadie!

You okay?

Uh, okay, Louie.

You just stay here
and be careful, okay?

All right.
I'll be right back.

Sadie!

Sadie!

Sadie!

Sadie!

Sadie, you answer me now!

Uncle Ben?

Sadie!

Sadie!

Sadie, for God's sake,
answer me.

Sadie!

Sadie!

Oh!

[Vulture shrieks]

Oh, God!



Uncle Ben?

Uncle Ben.

Sadie?

Uncle Ben?

Uncle Ben.

Are you okay?

Uncle Ben?

Are you guys okay?

Uncle Ben, are you guys
hiding from me?

Sadie.

Uncle Ben.

Uncle Ben?

Uncle Ben.


[Rock music playing]

*

You guys want
to smoke a joint?

Jay, is it okay?

Shit, yeah.
Just open the window.

Where are we going?

A local told me
about this shortcut.

It should take about an hour
off of our time.

Hope that local guy
wasn't fucking with you.

I've seen a hundred
shitty horror movies

That start out like this.

Chill out.

Trust me, all right?

I know what I'm doing,
especially when I'm high.

[Man grunting]

Where are we?

Oh, God, not again.

Hey, Olivia.

Look,

I don't know
what was in that shit

You gave us last night.

I was pretty fucked up.

And the party's over now,
so why don't you get

Your fat ass off
of my boyfriend's lap?

Hey, Kat, all I'm doing
is sharing a joint.

There's no need to get all
bent out of shape over it.

You're so beautiful.

I'm flattered you would even
consider being jealous of me.

The truth is, I would rather
steal you away from Josh.


[Flies buzzing]

Kat, you're suffering
from misplaced anger.

You really enjoyed
last night.

I could tell.

I'm an expert.

You just can't handle it
right now,

And you're taking it
out on me.

It's the shock

Of discovering
your repressed

Bisexuality.

Honey, the only thing
that I'm repressing right now

Is the urge to beat
your fucking face in.

That's it.

[All yelling]

What are you doing to her?

You burned me.

You did it to yourself,
you crazy bitch.

I'll show you crazy.

Stop.

Come here!

Chill out.

You two,
fucking knock it off.

I'm serous;
I'm driving here.

Damn!

Shit, Jay, look out!

Oh, shit!

[All scream]


Oh, shit.

Shit, shit, shit.

Fuck!

We just hit somebody.

Fuck.

We got to find him, man.

He could still be alive.

I fucking doubt it, Jay.

There was nothing I could do.

He was fucking standing there

In the middle
of the fucking road!

Fuck!

I just...
I just killed a man.

Stay the fuck away
from me, Kat.

I mean it.
What?

This accident isn't
Jay's fault; It's yours.

You fucking
distracted him.

God! Olivia's right.
You are fucking crazy.

Asshole!

Bitch.

Damn.

Oh, God.

Shit.

God.


Get it off!
Help! Get it off!

The crazy bastard
was trying to kill me.

Shit!

Oh, my God.

What... how can he
still be alive?

There's nothing
fucking left of him.

[All scream]

Where the fuck
did he go?

Where did he go?

Something pulled him
back under the rv.

Josh, let's go
check it out.

Jay, be careful!

What is it?
What is it?

It was big-ass
fucking birds.

[All screaming]

In the rv!
Come on!

Come on! Go!
Hurry up!

Come on, Jay.
Get in.

Hurry.
Shit! Get in!

Everybody, be quiet.
Be quiet.

[Vultures shrieking]

[All yelling]

Ah my ears!

[Clattering on roof]

Where's it going?

Ah! Ah!
It's in the bathroom!

Josh, be careful.

Be careful.

I got your back.

Shit, there's nothing in there.

Maybe they're gone.

[Glass shatters]

[All screaming]

[Vultures screeching]

[All screaming]

Get him off me!
Get him off me!

Jay, look out!

Get him off me!

Get him off me!

Swing at him!
Swing at him!

Shut the door!
Shut the door!

Come on! Come on!
Get back in!

Let's get out of here.

Come on.
Let's go.

Go. Come on.
Get out of here.

Get out. Get out.
Get out.

Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.

Hurry up. Hurry up.
Hurry up.

Hurry.

Take this.

Let's go, Jay.
Come on.

Come on!
Let's go!

Suck on this, motherfucker.

[Vulture shrieking]

[All screaming]

My eyes!

No! Jay!

[All screaming]

[Gas hissing]

This way!

Come on!
Go this way!

Run! Go! Run!

[Vultures shrieking]

What was that?

Oh, fuck!

They're behind us!

They're in front of us.

God, they're everywhere!

[Vultures screeching]

They're everywhere.

What are we going to do?

Come on!
Go! Run!

Come on, Olivia!

Come on!

Run!

Run!
Don't look back!

Run!

Keep moving!
Let's go.

I don't feel good.

Those monsters
took my Jay!

I'm sick.

Why is this happening
to us, Kat?

Jesus, please let this
be a dream.

Pris... pris!
Listen to me.

I need you to be strong
right now, okay?

You want to make it
out of here alive?

Why is this happening?

Is God punishing us?

I don't know, pris!

I don't know what the fuck
is going on, okay?

Just be strong.

[Pris sobbing]

Come on.
It's time to go home.

Are we
going home now?

Yeah,
Olivia.

We're going home.

Come on; We gotta go.

This way?

I don't see anything.

I think we're safe.

Here.

Is this a game?

'Cause I don't want
to play it anymore.

Careful. Look out.

It's nice here.

We're all
going to die.

Those things are
demons from hell.

The devil must want
our souls.

Stop it, Olivia.

You're scaring me.

Don't talk like that, please.

They're coming
for us, pris.

Can't you hear them

Drawing closer
and closer?

Shut up!
Stop it!

You're in shock,

Olivia.

You don't know
what you're saying.

You're sick.

Kat, listen.

About what I said before.

I didn't mean it.
You're right.

Everything that's happening now,
this is all my fault.

If I hadn't picked
that stupid fight with Olivia,

Jay would still be alive,
and we'd all be safe...

Listen...

Driving home in the rv.

No, it was an accident.

It's not your fault.

I am a fucking
crazy bitch.

It was an accident.

It was nobody's fault,
all right?

You're okay, babe.

It's all right.

But that guy.

Those birds.

What the hell
is going on?

I don't know.

But we're gonna
get out of here, okay?

Promise?

Promise.

Oh, babe.

[Suspenseful music]

*

I know a secret.

What is it, Olivia?

What's your secret?

No.

Give me your hand.

Come on.

Here, take this.

Oh, my God.

What are those?

Shit, those are nests.

Oh, my God.

Shit. Shit.


Get back.

Pris, stay back.
Get away.

Come on.

Jay!

Oh, Jay!

You killed my friend,
you bastards.


Bitches!


Olivia!

Olivia!

Get them off me! Kat!

Get it off her leg!


Help me!

Olivia!

Olivia!

Josh, do something!

Olivia, no!

[Vulture shrieking]

[Vulture shrieking]

My ears.

God, it hurts!

Shit, where'd it go?

Come on, you fucker.

Josh!

It's right behind you!

Josh!

[Vulture shrieking]

Come on.

[Both yelling]

Kill him, Josh!

[Vulture screeching]

Kill it!

Come on, Josh!
Hurry!

Come on.

Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

There's some more.

Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on, go!

Keep moving!
Go!

[Vultures shrieking]

Come on;
They're right behind us.

They're closing in.

Get in the cornfield.

Go!

Go. Keep moving.

Let's go. Come on.

Go, go, go.

Come on!

Come on, pris.
Get up.

Get up. Get up.
Get up. Let's go.

Come on.

Keep moving.

Josh?

Pris?

Josh!

[Vulture shrieks]

[Kat screams]

It's just us.
It's just us.

It's okay.
It's us.

Come on;
Let's go.

We got to get
out of here.

Duck!

Come on.
Come on. Go.

Come on; Let's go.

Go, go!

Yeah, all right.

They're right behind us.

Come on. Go!

They're coming.
They're right behind us.

Come on.

[Vulture shrieks]

It's bolted shut.

Come on.
We got to go around.

Let's get it open.

Get inside; Let's go.

Come on.

Come on.
Move. Move.

[Girls screaming]

Pris, get in.

Come on, pris.

Come on; Get in.

[Pris screaming]

Get in here; Come on!



This is creepy.

Josh.

What the hell is this place?

Josh.

Oh, God.

No.

No, no more.



Pris!

[Electricity zapping]

Josh!

Josh!


Josh, get up.

[Electricity zapping]

Hee-haw!

[With Russian accent]
Do you want me
to beat you, gooey?

You must remain
very, very quiet,

Or there will be no beating
for you tonight.


[Skin crackling]

Please forgive me.

I am not myself today.

You see, I died

And was resurrected
as this pathetic thing

Which you see
standing before you,

The living embodiment
of my mistakes.

I am Dr. Viktor vasilienko.

And who are you?

What's the matter?

Cat got your tongue?

K...

Kat.

My name is Kat.

What an amusing coincidence.

Well, Kat,
I cannot tell you

How happy I am
that you and your friends

Decided to intrude
upon my domain,

Except, of course,

For the loss
of mathius.

I consider this

An opportunistic
turn of events.

Most convenient as well.

Please don't hurt me.

I'm afraid I cannot make
such a promise.

There will be pain,

Unbearable pain.

But it is all
for a worthy cause,

One greater than any
single person's destiny.

Don't do this.

No, don't do this.

I have developed
an overwhelming urge

To pluck out your eyes
and eat them.


Do not fear.

I can suppress
such desires.

After all, I'm not a monster.


Your friend has become
a bride of rage.

[Suspenseful music]

*

You shall be one as well.

No.

No! No!

No!

No!

[Garbled speech]

Get away from her,
you fucking freak.

That's right;
I'm talking to you,

You little bastard.

I'm gonna shove that monkey
up your ass.

Misfit!

Get away from her,
you perverted wretch.

You little fool.

I need her
for my experimentation.

If she expires,

Then you can have
your way with her.

No, no.

Sometimes you disgust me,
misfit.

You're both conscious.

Good.

However, you will
have to wait your turn.

I'm not yet finished
with your friend.

What kind of fucking madhouse
is this?

One which I am most proud of

And one which
your simple mind

Could not possibly
comprehend.

Why are you doing this?

What have you done
to pris?

Subjects for my experiments
have become quite scarce,

Due to the vultures...

That is,
until you three appeared.

And now...

It's showtime.

[Drill whirs]

You monster!

How could you?

How could you?

She never hurt anyone
in her entire life.

A most admirable trait,
I assure you.

Gooey, put your finger
right there.

Good boy, gooey.

I shall now administer
the new test serum.

There is no time
to follow proper procedure.

I am forced to improvise
my technique.

We shall soon learn
if the formula is successful.

What if it isn't?

What about pris?

What's gonna happen to her,

You bastard?

She will die.

I will then infect one of you
and try again.

Why are you doing this to us?

Life passes so quickly.

I remember everything

As if it happened
just yesterday.

As a boy, I vowed

Upon the premature graves
of my mother and father

That I would one day eradicate
for all time

This curse of humanity

Which had taken them
away from me,

A disease called cancer.

I devoted my every waking moment
to study.

Nothing would stop me
from my goal.

I was not only the youngest

But the world's leading
biological engineer.

I was considered a genius,
a Mozart,

A Da Vinci in the field
of genetics.

I eventually succeeded

Where all others before me
had failed.

I discovered a cure for cancer.

Before
my scientific breakthrough

Could be announced
to the world,

My government collapsed
due to Western influence.

My research and discoveries
were confiscated, stolen

By ignorant, greedy individuals.

These same findings
were later sold

To various Western interests.

The pharmaceutical conglomerates
ignored

The potential benefits
to humanity

In favor of their own profits.

It is more profitable
to treat the disease

Than to cure it
once and for all.

Instead of
the nobel peace prize,

I was ostracized by my peers,
who branded me a charlatan,

A madman.

Those who profited from my work

Saw to it
that I was hidden away.

The state condemned me for life

To a hospital
for the mentally insane.

They tried to break me,
to destroy my mind.

Why they did not just kill me

I will never understand.

I knew then
that somehow, some way,

I would have my revenge.

I could not contain my rage
any longer.

I was forced to kill to survive.

My dark side was unleashed,
my hatred unbound.

All who stand in my way,
be damned.

I learned the names
of the institutions

Who had purchased my findings
and sought them out.

Everywhere, I was misled,

Told lies of denial
and of complicity.

Still, I tried to convince
someone to release my cure.

It was a waste of time.

I begged, and I pleaded
with your press

To publish my story.

My credibility was ruined.

It was then I decided to punish

This self-righteous,
capitalistic society.

If needed, I would use
terroristic methods.

I created a genetic disease
to wield as a weapon.

[Melancholy piano music]

My rage, my wrath,
my revenge, my plague.

This contagion is spread

Through the exchange
of bodily fluids.

It is unstoppable.

Once infected with rage,
there is no hope for survival...

Save one.

My antidote.

Only when my full research

And the crimes of these
institutions against humanity

Are revealed
will I stop this plague.

Ignore my demands...

[Bottle clatters]

And rage will devour you.

Rage was designed to infect

Only human beings,
not wildlife.

I had not put
into consideration

The unique enzymes present

In the digestive system
of the vultures.

These creatures discovered
one of my expired subjects

And ingested
his mutagen-tainted flesh.

Doing so, a new strain
of rage was created,

One which could infect
every living thing

On the face of the planet.

My attempt

At extortion failed,

My cure no longer sufficient.

A new antidote must be found.

So the vultures threw

A monkey wrench
in your crazy scheme.

Yes.

The vultures could spread rage

To the four corners
of the earth.

The results would be
apocalyptic.

This is not your daddy's
bird flu.

Shh.

Josh.

I cannot believe this.

The serum,

It has failed.


Bring me the next one, boys,

And make a pot of coffee;

It's going to be
a long night.

Josh!

Hey.

Pick on someone

Your own size,

You half-pint
transvestite freak.

Get me out of here!

Hurry!

Get me out of here!

Josh!

How dare you jeopardize
everything I have strived for?

Did I not tell you

The fate of the world
rests in my hands?

You stupid fool!


[Gun clicking]

Untie me!

Josh, untie me!

[Speaking Russian]

[Kat screams]

[Vasilienko yelling]

Pris!

There's nothing
we can do for her.

We gotta get out of here.

No, I can't
leave her here!

That freak
went down here.

Come on; Let's go.

Come on.
Get in. Go!

[Vulture shrieking]

[Electricity zapping]



He's blind!
He can't see us.


Josh! Help me!
Help!

Kat, run!

[Crunching noise]
[Josh screams]



Please don't do this.

I'll do anything you want.

Anything!

Please, just don't kill me.

You want to play,
you little fucker?

Let's play.

Like that?

How does that feel?

Yeah, I'll fucking kill you!

Freak!
I'll kill you!

Damn straight.

Yeah, you like that?

Here's another!



Are you all right?

Where's the little freak?

He... he stabbed me.

Then I beat him to death.

I think I know the way out.

This way.

He was right there.

Shit.

Where'd he go?

Die!

Die, you fucking evil
oompa-loompa!

Freak!

Kat, he's dead.


Shit!

Let's get out of here!

Come on! Go!

Come on, Kat.

We made it, Kat.

We're gonna be okay.

[Suspenseful music]


No!

Josh!

Just where do you two think
you are going?

Josh!

I cannot allow you to escape.

Josh, get up.

We must rebuild

And carry on.

Let her go, you crazy madman.

Do you think I would allow
a whelp such as yourself

To stop me after all
that I've been through?

My little Kat,
I cannot

Let you run away.

There is still so much
we have to do.

I have a plan.

No!

No, no, no, no,
don't be upset, my dear.

Together,
we can save mankind.

You will be the Eve
of a new age.

Wake up, Josh!

No, no.

Please, no!

Don't do this!

Please, let us go.

Embrace the moment.

This is your destiny,
your purpose in life.

I wanna go home.

You are home.

No! Let us go,
you fucker!

One bite, and you
will be infected.

I know that through you,
I will discover the cure.

I sought to save mankind.

Look how I am repaid
for my sacrifices.

The world is not worthy
of my benevolence.

Let it be damned.

With the cure,

You and I shall
repopulate the earth.

Our progeny will be immune,

Become fruitful,
and multiply.

A new utopia shall rise
form the ashes.

I'd rather die!

You have no choice
in the matter!

I have become a God.

Nothing can stop me.

Wrong, asshole.


(Vasilienko's head)
Over here!

Come and get me.

Idiot!

I'm behind you!

You useless idiot,
I'm over here!

No, no.

No!

Josh!

Did he hurt you?

I'm all right.

Let's go.

Come on.

[Glass shattering]

You okay?

Come on.
Let's go.

Do you think
we've been infected?

I don't know.

But we'll know
soon enough.

How far do you think it is
back to town?

It could be 10, 15 Miles,
if we're lucky.

[Ominous music]

[Vultures shrieking]

[Kat screams]

No!
