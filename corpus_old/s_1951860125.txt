You need a man,
a red hot loving Stan.

If you wanna be satisfied,
I'm your guy, forget Kai

You need me, 790,
I have the technology

for thee, sweet pea.

No, me...
Me

Me
Me

Why should she want you?

Because I'm a man, you're a can.

You're a man? That's news.

Well, you're a can - not news!

At least I can sing.
So can I.

Since when? You're not
wanted here, leave!

You leave!

You!

You!

I'm leaving.

Where are you going?

Yes, where?

To wake Kai.

What for?

Yes, what for?

To sing to, to talk to, I don't know.

Zev, come on now. You know dead man
only has a limited amount of

He has enough protoblood to last
for months.

Months fly by!

And cryostasis gives him years.

Look, if you wanna sing gorgeous,
sing to me!

Sing to me!

I know how to open his pod myself,
you know

Yeah, but I'm almost certified.
It's a delicate machine,
you gotta have the touch.

Exactly - so you're excluded.

Stand aside and let me direct Zev.

I know what I'm doing.

Since when?

Just open it.

Not like that, you got
the order all wrong.

I kill you now in the name
of His Divine Shadow.

Stan!

Oh yeah!

Kai!

We must freeze him, now.

Wait - the key! He has to give
up the key to the Lexx
or we're helpless.

That's true. It's up to you Zev.

A living key must pass to
a living creature.

Stanley? Give me the key.

Captain Stan...

Stanley, I need it to save you,
to save us all.

You're cute.

Please Stan, please..

I'm late for work -
I gotta - I gotta...

Come on, Stanley, surrender the key!

Surrender the key to me.

Oh yeah.

Isn't it wonderful how some days
turn out?...

I don't understand

why you insist that I keep wasting
countless hours executing your search.

We should be celebrating!

Just keep looking.

As you wish, luscious dish.

The protein regenerator was able
to repair Stan's hand before.

Why wouldn't it work now?

Stan's heart is shattered.

He would suffer brain death
long before we could repair it.

That wasn't your fault, Kai.
It was Stan's.

He didn't work it right.

I am aware of that.

You are not His Shadow's assassin
anymore.

Stan might disagree.

But you also saved his life
many times - mine too.

I have ended countless more lives
than I have saved.

No, that wasn't you,
that was His Shadow controlling you.

Ah! Ugh!

What?

Horrible news!

What?

There's hope for Tweedle!

This is MedSat medical terminal,

proud home of the finest physicians
in the Quadra system.

If it's broken, we can mend it.
If it's bleeding, we can stem it.

If it's spreading, we can halt it.
If it's sagging we can lift it.

MedSat -
where medicine is at.

Professional. Affordable.

Receiving patients now.

Will that do?

Lexx -

set course for that satellite.

As you request, captain.

MedSat medical terminal,
this is Zev of B3K.

I'm acting captain of
the space vessel Lexx.

We've an emergency with one of
our crew,

and we need to bring him aboard.

What is the nature of your
medical emergency?

Our captain has had his heart
badly punctured.

One moment please.

Do you have a Q4A5 planet
insurance waiver?

No...

A D class standard waiver?

Sorry.

Any waivers of any kind?

No.

Then cash will be fine.

Pardon?

Precious metals or bankable equivalent.

We have no precious metals
or bankable anything.

Then your situation becomes
a class 1313.

What's that?

Ignored.

You can't do that.

I'm afraid I have no choice.
Policy is policy.

We will pay you, later.

I'm sorry, MedSat does
not accept credit.

This is an emergency!

I understand.

Please inform the next person
to appear on the screen.

Hey, lady - watch.

Lexx - blow up that little
red moon we just passed.

As you command, captain.

I'm Dr Flag

chief administrator of this facility.

I understand that you have
a medical problem?

And a money problem.

We aren't the sort to get
hung up over money,

when a person's life hangs
in the balance.

How can we help?

Once again I apologise
for your initial reception.

Our primary responsibility
is to help people in need

regardless of their financial situation.

I am pleased to inform you that
your captain has been assigned
to a top surgeon,

the very eminent -

Dr Kazan, at your service.

Let me add my voice to the criticism
of your rude welcome.

I promise you that the quality
of surgery here on MedSat is better
than the administration.

They sometimes forget that -

human lives are at stake!

What caused the injury?

I punctured him - with this.

It was an accident.

A beautiful, wonderful accident.

We'll fix him up, as good as new.

Don't knock yourself out...

Quiet!

My team is the best of the best,

but this looks like no mere
cardial rupture.

His heart has been pulverised.

I won't feed you any promises but -

what would we be if we didn't try.

Let's go people.

Let's get to work.

Dr Kazan seems to know exactly
what he is doing.

Ha - if he knew what he was doing,

he would promptly kill Tweedle
and then himself.

Maybe I should get you rewired
while we're here.

I only say these things because
I'm crazy about you.

He must be some kind of warrior.

Those clothes, that hair
That weapon.

There's no question that he's
potentially dangerous -

beautiful incision, doctor.

And yet he's strangely benign.

Curious...

Very curious...

Cauterise that artery, please.

Splendidly done, doctors.

Yea!

The dream is over...

I have to admit it was touch and
go there for a while,

but there is no reason your captain
shouldn't make a full recovery.

Thank you Dr. Funz,
Dr. Veezra.

Good luck then.

Thank you.

Good luck.

Thank you.

It will be some time before he wakes,
as much as a day or two.

We have some rooms available, if you -

Thank you, but I will stay here
with Stanley.

As you wish.

Then perhaps some food
would be in order.

I do not eat.

How about you, Zev?

Would you care to join me for dinner?

Oh, I'd like that.

Let's go then.

You are not going anywhere -
Òû òîæå íå åøüyou don't eat either

But darling -

No, you're going to stay here with Kai.

Stan needs you.

You need me.

to save you from that shifty hack
of a physician!

So heartless. So cruel.
So delicious.

Dr. Kazan! Dr. Kazan!

Dr. Kazan

did you hear? It's official.
I've made a complete recovery.

That's excellent news Mrs. Deebee.

My tumour's gone. My pains are gone

and I've got the rest of my life back.

And all because of you.

I'm only one member of a highly
dedicated team, Mrs Deebee.

Doctor, I am dedicated to you.

Isn't he just so good looking?

Thank you.

Shall we?

The gallant crew of the Lexx.

I have to say that I feel
rather ordinary next to you.

To Zev.

May your every wish be realised.

I - wish to be kissed.

Show me that trick you do with
your hand again.

I can do many tricks with my hand.

How exactly did Stan pass it to you?

I don't know...

he transferred it to me as he was dying.

Was it automatic?

or did it require an act
of will on his part?

I don't know. I really don't know
how it works.

A beam of energy locked inside your body -

mysterious, alluring, powerful -

very much like you.

Go on...

You have a force, a burning vitality.

I know you. It sounds crazy,
but I do.

You wear your destiny on your skin.
You're one of the chosen

I wouldn't go that far.

Zev - where do you see yourself
in five years?

I don't know - maybe on a nice planet
I can call home.

with someone special.

What's wrong?

I can't do this.

not with you.

I shouldn't have seduced you into
accepting what you already know.

I lied, Zev.

I'm not ordinary.

Not next to you, not next to anybody.

What I really feel is that
you are my equal.

You and me, Zev, are meant to be
partners in greatness.

Your home will not be a hut
on some swampy outback planet -

That's not what I had in mind.

your home will be the entire universe.

aboard the starship Lexx,
with me at your side.

You want to join the crew?

We'll be the crew - you and me

What about the others?

Leave them behind.

I can't, not just like that.

Be bold, Zev. don't compromise
yourself for sentiment.

Together we can own the universe.

You know this is what you want.

You are one of the chosen,
we both are. Seize your fate.

Can't we just have sex instead?

Look -
I need you. You need me.

We will make a great team.

But if you insist on making a foolish
choice, to stay with the others -

What is so foolish about it?

Stan is weak and pathetic.

Kai is an undead freak of science,
and the robot is a cartoon!

Who do you think you are?!

Forgive me my darling. I've offended you.

It's just that I - I so hoped
this next step would be unnecessary.

Kazan here. We're away. Be careful.

It couldn't be simpler.

Take me to Zev, come back,
and Stan will still be here.

Zev wants to be alone.

No, she only thinks she wants to be alone.

what was that?

What was what?

I heard something.

Ah! What's that? It's - Zev! Zev!
Zev! Zev!

Hi there.

Everything we want...

Anytime we want it.

Dream it...

Take it...

Status...

Money... A place beyond money.

Power... Raw and unlimited.

And nothing else matters.

First thing we learned in medical school.

We've even got matching tattoos!

Tattoo?

We suspect the key can be released
as an act of will.

We know it can be released
at the point of death.

And as doctors, we know that the will
can be broken at the point of death.

So, better to offer us the key,
if you can.

Should we have to go in there
and try to get it...

things could get ugly.

I used to be ugly.

None of us wants that...

The risks are enormous.

Why die for those ridiculous
characters you call a crew?

We're your friends. They're
your handicap.

My friends?

Ah, it could be so special. Good luck.

Bye bye - ah!

You're welcome.

We're ready. Are you?

Dr. Kazan! Dr. Kazan!

Dr. Kazan! Dr. Kazan.

I've looked everywhere for you.

Help me. Help me.

My dear, relax.

you've got all the help you need
with our Dr Kazan.

they are releasing me tomorrow,

but I do not want to leave
without thanking you again.

I owe you my life, doctor.

What you owe me, you insipid old cow,
is a fortune in bills.

so trade in your gratitude for some cash.

But doctor, really -

And here's the best part -
there was never anything wrong with you.

not a thing...

You never had a tumour.

We went in, poked around,

messed things up a little
to ensure your speedy return...

emptied your purse
and sewed you shut.

What? I didn't have a tumour?

Mrs. Deebee - you are a tumour!

Last chance, Zev.

Close your eyes, concentrate
and surrender to me.

No.

The hand that heals
becomes the hand that steals.

Let's start with an artery probe.

Look how quickly his flesh
reconstitutes - fascinating.

Perhaps we could dissolve it in acid.

A brilliant idea, from a brilliant woman.

Do you hear me, sir?.

Yes, I can hear you.

I have to say, you are hard to kill.

That has not always been the case.

So, the question is - how do we kill you?

The answer is, I am already dead -
as you soon may be.

I'll bet you're feeling
a little angry right now.

Feelings don't enter into it.

You should be thanking us for our efforts.

For a creature like yourself,

eternal peace would be a blessing.

On some other occasion, perhaps.

The acid didn't work.

Why don't we just keep him frozen?

Because if he ever thaws out,
he will certainly come after us -

won't you, my friend?

Yes I will.

We can blow up MedSat
with him on it when we leave.

That won't stop you, will it?

No.

Besides, I can't resist the challenge.

It seems clear that you will
be able to rematerialise unless

we break you down into subatomic particles.

Our satellite drive is powered by
a plasma beam from the ion furnace.

I'm going to redirect that beam
right into your face.

What do you think of my plan, dead man?

Fire away.

Your plan might break up MedSat too.

Not if I'm smart - which of course, I am.

I used to believe that the doctor thing
was selfless and noble.

I would say "What would we be,
if we didn't try?".

and actually mean it -

then it just became a line.
Guaranteed panty remover.

It worked on you.

Of course, being a love slave

your panties aren't exactly
glued on, are they?

What I do is not noble,
Zev, far from it.

But I do beautiful work.
Perfect work.

on undeserving losers...

Poor you.

Patients are wallets...

wallets with entrails,
and I reach my hands down into those
greasy guts and stitch them up -

for what? Little dribs and drabs of money.

But not any longer,
because I will have the Lexx.

At least you're honest.

Honest, young, gifted and gorgeous!

We don't have to do this, Zev.

Let me have the key.

Never!

Dr. Kazan - I think maybe you
should hold off on the juice

Excuse me?

There's something about her DNA
that's a little - unfamiliar...

She's got the key to the Lexx
buried in it.

Maybe, but that's not what I mean.

I need more time to analyse
her cell structure.

You don't have it.

I'm telling you that there are some
truly abnormal elements.

So figure them out, that's your job.

I'm keeping the key.

We'll see about that.

This will sting a bit -
a lot, actually.

Wake up Tweedle...

wake up!

Guh! Wake up.

Tweedle, wake up -

Yes!

Come on!

Vital signs?

20%

18%

12%

8%

More.

5%

3%

More.

She'll die!

Die? Maybe...

Obey - certainly.

Give it up Zev.

More.

2%

1%

She's at the point of death.

Well, well - I knew it.

That's right.

that's right...

come to papa...

looking good...

Oh my...

um, doctor?

Not now, Berg.

Excuse me, but I insist that -

I said not now, Berg.

I win - again.

Doctor - she's not entirely human.

I can't hear you, Berg.

She's not all human.

Not human? What the hell is she then?

Some kind of reptile.

A reptile?

I saved your captain.

I saved him.

I know where Kai is.

If you kill me now,
you don't know where to find him.

I'm too beautiful to die!

Zev!

Zev, where are you, Zev?

It wakes.

Where am I?

MedSat medical terminal.

MedSat? What is this stuff?

The doctors who healed you have taken Zev.
We have to find her!

The wrap!

What's the matter with this thing?

Get the wrap off my eyes,
I'm losing control!

We're gonna hit 'em, do something!

Aah! Eat the robot!

Zev! Is it you?

Zev?

I told you that doctor was a quack.

Come on, follow her.

I'm trying.

Try harder.

I hate you.

Come on!

Wow! And that was just a test.
This is definitely going to work.

OK - full power.

Zev! Darling! No! No!!!!!

We have to do something.

I believe we are too late.

No, no...

Goodbye.

Thank you.

I had a good life with you guys.

I did all right for a girl
who grew up in a box

You can't die. You can't...

I'll miss you.

Zev...

I love you.

No!

What are you doing?

Bringing Zev home.

Forever, by the Zev, Zev...

Forever by Zev I did lay...

I'm gonna turn the Lexx around.

and I'm gonna blow the MedSat
medical terminal into dust! Hear hear!

That's revenge. Do you think
it is an acceptable motivation?

I don't care.

Those who did this to her are already dead.

Well, that's just gonna take
some of the fun out of it.

Zev died saving us.

It would not be her wish.

Yeah, just like her.
Deny me everything.
