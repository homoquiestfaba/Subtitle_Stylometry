Kimi!

Kimi, don't stop! Keep going!

No more! Please stay away!

Kimi!

Don't you dare touch my daughter!

On G'throd ai'ek geb'ey'k!

Yyrg-Sorhoth ngah 'ngai' yzhro'k.

First it rains, now it's hot as hell.
Damn fools are obsessed, I tell ya.

Good morning, Koba.
Nice to see you, too, Koba.

Mornin'.
There you are, Yoshiken.

They're just getting
to the important part.

What is it? Something the matter, Taka?

It's nothing. Just my imagination.

Well, those kids are sure having fun.

They don't hold a candle to our Kimi,
though.

Hey, Koba, why don't you scrounge up some
scrapped AC units and fix 'em up for us?

We could die o' heat stroke at our age.
And poor little Kimi!

You think I can find one for each of us?
Don't be dumb.

Kimi's doing fine, and the rest of us
old fogies know how to grin and bear it.

I say give me iced water or give me death.
That's good enough for me.

What the hell happened?

You gave it death, by the looks of it.

Well, that's certainly one way to
escape the heat. Permanently, at that.

Sometimes, Yoshiken, you scare me.

What a surprise. Everyone is helping
with the funeral procession

and you lazy coots are taking it easy.

Speaking of nut jobs,
look who just showed up.

Momo, Wada, you two are lifesavers.
Thank you. You're far too kind.

I am exhausted.

The nerve. Day drinking on the morning of
the funeral. Don't you lot have any tact?

You got it all wrong. Alcohol plays
a crucial role in funerals everywhere.

The drinking of spirits represents
purification and alms-giving.

Is that so? In that case, I'll join you.

What about you, Wada?

No, thank you. You know I don't drink.

How much longer can this tradition go on?
How's it still going strong?

Not even the gods they're worshiping
know the answer to that.

It'll probably start dying out
in the coming century.

Well, I for one hope it lives on...
that Kurosaki funeral procession.

<i>The origins of thetorii gates</i>
<i>are long forgotten,</i>

and all that's left now
are rituals and songs.

It's probably related to the Kurokado
people who once called Kurosaki.

Perhaps those ceremonies
could be the remnants

of unheard-of ancient tribal communions.

Another lesson, professor?

Kurosaki's very own
Mr. Know-It-All lives up to his name.

You can joke all you want to
but these traditions

are more important
than any of you realize.

Kimi, you're here?
Kimi!

Hi, Taka! And Koba, and Yoshiken,
and Momo, and Wada!

Good morning!

Why's it so hot?

It feels even hotter
than last summer, doesn't it?

Maybe it's that global warming
I keep hearing about.

All right, enough with the chit chat,
you ninnies.

Can't you see our little Kimi is dying
of heat stroke over here?

How about we use the outdoor sink
to cool off, hmm?

I tried that. But the water's only hot.

Feels like I'm on fire.

If I don't get out of this heat
I think I'm gonna be sick.

I want to have shaved ice!

The store room!
The store room!

I always wanted to know what was
down here. I had no idea it was so big.

Long ago, there was a war.

Everyone in town came together
and built this as a safe place.

The last time we were down here
was before Kimi was born.

We were looking for Old Man Kojima.

That's right. Kojima.
After he went missing,

we searched the complex from top to bottom
and eventually found him.

Since it was winter, he was frozen solid.

Wait, you mean something bad happened?

How could you say such a thing
in front of Kimi? You're scaring her.

You're the one who brought it up,
you know.

That's when we found out
what Kojima was up to in here.

He was taking things from all over
Kurosaki and keeping them in this room.

I don't remember digging out
this area one bit.

Maybe the tunnel leads
to a natural cavern.

Something stinks.

If I remember right...

Hah, I knew it!
Oh, wow!

It's huge! Just like the ones
they use at the shop!

That's right! With this baby we'll be
cooling off with shaved ice in no time!

Oh, careful you don't pull something!
You're nearly 80!

This is nothing.

You'll be able to get this
working again, right, Koba?

Of course I can. I've fixed up everything
from appliances to warships.

Perfect. Then let's head back.

You're not going back with them?

Well, aren't you?

Let's explore!
Let's explore!

<i>Let's find the treasure!</i>
<i>Let's find the treasure!</i>

The owners of all this stuff may be long
dead, but we ought to tidy up in here.

There's even more junk in here
than I remembered.

Hey, Taka, look at this!
It's a weird doll!

<i>That's akokeshi doll,</i>
<i>probably from Tsugaru.</i>

Check out this weird fan! It's got a girl!

Oh, I think that's
from some anime or another.

Look at that! It's some kinda weird...
Hold on. What is that?

Why, this is a zoetrope.
It's older than I am.

Let's see here.

If you spin it like this
and look through here...

Wow, it looks like it's moving!
How'd it do that?

Your mind fills in the
blanks between images,

tricking your eyes into seeing movement.

It's called an optical illusion.

Optical illusion.

When I used your binoculars,

your eyes look super small when I look
through it from the wrong direction.

Was that optical illusion?

In a sense, yes, but not exactly.

This here should explain it better.

The length of these two lines
is exactly the same

but one looks longer than the other. See?

It does! But why?

The human eye is easily deceived.

There are many ways to convince it
that the lies it sees are the truth.

It's an optical illusion.
Optical illusion. Okay! I won't forget.

<i>That must have been</i>
<i>an optical illusion, too.</i>

I wonder what this thing is? Hmm?

You okay?

What in the world? A dog?

It still has a collar.

Why on Earth would Kojima bring that here?

Is that...

I don't believe it. This is a huge find!

Ruins?
Yeah!

Kojima's storeroom appears to have been
built in an unexplored ancient cave!

I think this thing I found may
have belonged to the Kurokado.

Just look. Doesn't it look like
an artifact?

Is that supposed to be a star or an eye?

If this symbol is part of an unseen
written language,

it'd be the discovery of a lifetime.

You know what we should do?
Start a large-scale excavation!

Yoshiken, get that idiot to shut his trap!

It's too hot for his bullshit!

He's right. Can't this wait
until after it cools down, Taka?

We can't waste our time waiting.
We also found a dead dog in that place.

Did something happen?

I just saw Kimi
and she was as pale as a ghost.

See? This is exactly why we need
to do something about what's down there.

Yeah, you're right.

We can't take any chances
when it comes to our little Kimi.

Hey, Koba, why don't
we lock up the storeroom?

At least until we figure out
what to do with it.

Sure, I'll go and put
a padlock or something on it later.

I suppose that will have to do.

By the way, Wada,
what was that call you got earlier about?

I nearly forgot. We've got quite
a few new people moving in.

We're about to have a lot
of new neighbors.

<i>Who would willingly move into</i>
<i>a run down old building?</i>

Remember Tsurie Fisheries?

<i>I heard they hired more people. They need</i>
<i>somewhere to live, so here we are.</i>

<i>Their representative said his name was</i>
<i>Kishide or something like that.</i>

Yes, that's right.

It's as I said before, I found no evidence
that either the local subsidiary

or the language school
had any knowledge of the matter.

Yuri, you're missing out on
the scenery. It's gorgeous outside.

Pass. The ocean and some mountains?
No, thank you.

And guess what, Mommy?
It was the creepiest thing!

A dog! A dead dog!
It was all dried up like beef jerky!

And that room was a big surprise already!

I had no idea there was an underground
room down there in the first place!

Finding new stuff like that
is so much fun!

You never know what'll happen next
and everything's a surprise!

I seem worried?
That's just an optical illusion, Mommy!

Ah, sorry!
I forgot to change the calendar.

See you later, Mommy!

Anyone home?

Uh... hello?

Oh, sorry about that.

I should have known that
so many new faces would startle you.

You must be Mrs. Wada,
the building manager.

My name's Seiichi Koshide.
I'm with Tsurie Fisheries.

These are technical interns.

Basically, my job's to act
as a troubleshooter for them.

Wait a second. Are they all foreigners?

Yes, and they've traveled
all the way to Kurosaki

to study Japan's advanced technologies.

Good afternoon. My name, ma'am, is Rubel.

My friends are still learn the language,
but they are good people.

It's such a pleasure to meet you.

Hello. It is nice to meet you.
Hello. It is nice to meet you.

Right, yeah.
Okay, then. Good day.

Sorry, only one more thing.
I have for you the gift.

Here, sweets from homeland. Please enjoy.

Of course. Thank you. Good day.

My wife will drop by later.

Why'd it have to be foreigners?

Yes, your husband told me
you'd be stopping by.

Oh, good. I'm Keiko Koshide, and
this is our daughter. Say hello, honey.

I'm Yuri.
It's quite the pleasure to meet you.

My, what wonderful manners you have.

I'm so sorry we've been causing
such a fuss around the complex.

My husband connects businesses with
foreign technical interns for a living.

There seems to have been
a miscommunication and, well,

if any issues come up, please let us know.
Don't give it a second thought.

I'm sure he'll be fine,
and if you need anything, just ask.

It's nice to see so much youth here after
having only old folks in this building.

Is Hideo your husband?

Where are your manners?
No, it's fine. That's my son.

He's going through a rough patch.

And he's become a bit of a shut-in.

I'm sorry. We didn't mean to pry.

<i>No worries. He sometimes</i>
<i>goes for walks at night</i>

<i>so if you ever run into him, be sure to</i>
<i>say hello. He means well. He really does.</i>

<i>Those new residents</i>
<i>are causing quite a stir.</i>

<i>That's an understatement. The whole</i>
<i>thing's got my wife worked up in a tizzy.</i>

An apartment complex full of elderly folk
who've never left the country

encountering foreigners
for the very first time.

This situation's one big powder keg.

And old lady Wada's primed to set it off.

Only if you don't do it first.
Need a light?

I give it to people
straight up no matter what.

What's that big fella doin' over there?
Who knows?

Hey, now.
Attitudes like that are the problem.

Friendships start with hello.
All right, then.

I'll go introduce my...

Good morning!

Well, good morning, Kimi!
It looks like you're having some fun!

What are you doing? Come down and join us!

But there's too many people!

Wait, something's wrong.

Kimi, stay where you are!

Optical illusion!

Are... are you all right?

You saved me.

Kimi, you crazy little girl!
You could have gotten yourself killed!

Now, now, she's fine.
That's all that matters.

Young man, because of you,
Kimi is safe and sound.

Sorry, can you understand me?

Should I speak English?

No, it's okay.

I am strong, you know. It was no problem.

Your name is... Young Man?

It's confusing, since "kimi" can also mean
"you". That's her name. Kimi.

And you? What shall we call you?
Kanchan.

Can I put you down, Kimi?

Thanks for your help, Kan.

I was wrong about you, kid. You're not
so bad. But you still can't have our Kimi.

Don't take that old fart seriously.

More optical illusions!

Sorry if I scared you. Is your name Kimi?

I'm Yuri Koshide. I'm ten.

I moved in here today.

You must be the new girl I heard about!

Hi, I'm Kimi! I'm nine!

And you said your name is Yuri?

That's right. I'm just happy to meet
someone here who's around my age range.

Can you and I please be friends?

Of course! Yes, please!
Then let's mark the occasion!

Oh, wow! Is that a camera?

So skinny. And you get to have your own?
Pretty much.

I wonder where we can get
some prints made?

So what do you like to do for fun here?

Nothing much. Go to the beach, I guess?

And school. But everyone here's super
nice so I love living in Kurosaki.

I see.
I hope I can come to like it here, too.

Wait, I know! Wanna see something cool?

There's this real neat spot down here.
You're gonna love it.

You sure? This place is creepy.

Stupid thing.

Don't just stand there. Come on, let's go!
Go, go!

Hey, Kimi?

Where did she go?

This is bad. Seriously, this isn't funny!

I got you back real good.

Oh, my God. You're such a jerk, Kimi!

What is that thing?

This thing? It's a mummy dog. A real one.

Don't stick stuff like that
in someone's face, you jerk!

I take it back.
I don't wanna be your friend anymore.

I'm sorry.

Kimi!
That wasn't me. Really, I swear.

Is someone down there?

Kimi, what was that?

I don't know, but it came from down there.

Let's go look.
What? No way! Are you kidding me?

But isn't it just as scary
to stay back here?

Fine! In that case, I'm gonna go first!

I'm older than you so it's my job to keep
you safe, so stay behind me.

Got it?
Yeah. All right.

Is this another room?
Maybe. Turn your light on?

What are these?

Did that creep from earlier draw these?

They're all monsters! I'm scared!

Coming!

Well, now.
If it isn't Kimi and Yuri, was it?

Good evening!
Good evening!

What brings you here? Ah, that's right.

I made a big block of ice
for that shaved ice machine.

I made it in our freezer.
It'll be ready to eat tomorrow.

Wow, really? I can't wait!

But that's not why we stopped by.

We're here because we found this thing.
Here.

Oh, wow.
This is from that place I used to own.

I can't believe you remembered that.
Where did you find this?

We found it earlier.
We think Hideo dropped it.

We'd like to return it to him personally
Is that okay, Momo?

I suppose so, but you'll have to talk
to him. He'll get angry if he sees me.

Hideo? We're sorry, but we saw them.

All of the drawings in that room?

<i>But we won't tell Momo about them.</i>
<i>I mean, you hid them for a reason.</i>

<i>It was because you didn't want her</i>
<i>to start worrying about you, right?</i>

Those drawings make me think
you're in a lot of pain.

They made me scared
and now I'm really worried,

but just know that I'm on your side.

So, my dad gives the interns advice
when they get really sad or really angry.

He knows doctors and stuff
so I think maybe he can help you out.

And also we brought your pen.

AUGUST 18, 2000
Friday

What the hell happened?
I haven't the slightest.

We should clean this up, though.

If Wada sees this, she'll lose her mind.

Where's that God-awful racket coming from?

Yes?

What are you people doing?

Sorry, but miss,
we are have now our morning prayers.

It is very important. Our prayers...
What prayers?

Who gives a damn?
You people messed up our washing area!

What's with you foreigners?
Is this some kind of cult or something?

It's just like I said.
It's time we calm down a bit, Wada.

This is your prayer ritual? We're sorry.

Many of those who live here
aren't used to your practices.

It's not my fault their prayers sound so
demonic! Don't touch me, wrinkly bastard!

Looks like Wada's extra grumpy today.

I wish she'd just get along
with the new people.

Ah, I know! Shaved ice!

I bet it's just too hot.
That's why everyone's angry.

So if they want to, we'll eat yummy
shaved ice and all become friends.

Momo?

Momo? Hideo!

An optical illusion?
