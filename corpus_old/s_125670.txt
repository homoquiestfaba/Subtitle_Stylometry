PRINCETON UNIVERSITY - SEPTEMBER 1947

Mathematicians won the war.

Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes...

...and built the A-bomb.

Mathematicians, like you.

<i>The stated goal of the Soviets</i>
<i>is global Communism. </i>

In medicine or economics...

...in technology or space...

...battle lines are being drawn.

<i>To triumph, we need results... </i>

<i>... publishable, applicable results. </i>

Now who among you
will be the next Morse?

The next Einstein?

<i>Who among you will be</i>
<i>the vanguard of democracy... </i>

<i>... freedom, and discovery? </i>

<i>Today, we bequeath America's future</i>
<i>into your able hands. </i>

<i>Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen. </i>

MAN 1: It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

MAN 2: No, he wants it all for himself.

It's the first time the Carnegie Prize
has been split. Hansen's all bent.

MAN 1: He has his sights set on
Wheeler Lab, MIT's military think-tank.

<i>They're only taking one this year. </i>

MAN 2: Hansen's used to
being picked first.

MAN 1: Yeah, he's wasted on math.

MAN 2: He should be running for president.

There could be a mathematical explanation
for how bad your tie is.


NEILSON: Thank you.

Neilson, symbol cryptography.

Neils here broke a Jap code.
Helped rid the world of Fascism.

At least that's what he tells the girls,
eh, Neils?

The name's Bender. Atomic physics.

NEILSON: And you are?
SOL: Am I late?

BENDER: Yes, Mr. Sol.
SOL: Oh, good. Hi.

SOL: Sol. Richard Sol.
MARTIN: The burden of genius.

There he is.
So many supplicants, and so little time.

Mr. Sol.
How are you, sir?

MARTIN: Bender.
BENDER: Nice to see you.

BENDER: Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
MARTIN: Thank you.

I'll take another.

Excuse me?

MARTIN: Pardon me.
I assumed you were the waiter.

BENDER: Play nice.
SOL: Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.

MARTIN: Honest mistake.

<i>Well, Martin Hansen. </i>

It is Martin, isn't it?

Why, yes, John, it is.

I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

I've read your preprints...

...both of them.

The one on Nazi ciphers...

...and the other one
on nonlinear equations...

...and I am supremely confident
that there is not a single seminal...

...or innovative idea in either one of them.

Enjoy your punch.


Gentlemen, meet John Nash...

<i>... the mysterious West Virginia genius. </i>

<i>The other winner</i>
<i>of the distinguished Carnegie Scholarship. </i>

BENDER: Okay.
SOL: Yeah?

BENDER: Of course.

[Choral music plays on record-player]

CHARLES: [Coughs] Oh, Christ.

The prodigal roommate arrives.

Roommate?

Oh, God, no.

[Music slows to a stop]

CHARLES: Did you know that
having a hangover...

...is not having enough water
in your body...

...to run your Krebs cycle?

<i>Which is exactly what happens to you</i>
<i>when you're dying of thirst. </i>

So, dying of thirst...

...would probably feel...

<i>... pretty much like the hangover</i>
<i>that finally bloody kills you. </i>

John Nash?

Hello.

Charles Herman.

Pleased to meet you.

PLAYER: [Outside] All right! Well done!

CHARLES: Well, it's official.
I'm almost human again.

<i>Officer, I saw the driver who hit me. </i>
<i>His name was Johnny Walker. </i>

Whew.

CHARLES: Well, I got in last night
in time for...

...English department cocktails.

Cock was mine...

...the tail belonged to a particularly
lovely young thing with a passion for...

...D.H. Lawrence.
You're not easily distracted, are you?

I'm here to work.
Are you? Right.

I see. Crikey!

Is my roommate a dick?

Hmm?

Listen.

If we can't break the ice...

...how about we drown it?

CHARLES: So what's your story?

<i>You the poor kid that never got to go</i>
<i>to Exeter or Andover? </i>

Despite my privileged upbringing,
I'm well-balanced.

I have a chip on both shoulders.


Maybe you're just better with
the old integers than you are with people.

JOHN: My first grade teacher said
I was born with two helpings of brain...

...but only half a helping of heart.


CHARLES: Wow! She sounds lovely!

The truth is that I...

I don't like people much.

And they don't much like me.

But why,
with all your obvious wit and charm?


Seriously, John.

Mathematics...

Mathematics is never going to lead you
to a higher truth.

And you know why?

Because it's boring. It's really boring.

You know, half these schoolboys
are already published?

I cannot waste time
with these classes and...

<i>... these books. </i>


Memorizing the weaker assumptions
of lesser mortals!


I need to look through...

...to the governing dynamics.

Find a truly original idea.

That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.

It's the only way that I'll ever...
Matter.

Yes.

MARTIN: All right, who's next?
SOL: I've played enough go for today.

Come on.
I hate this game.

Cowards, all of you!

None of you rise to meet my challenge?

Come on, Bender. Whoever wins,
Sol does his laundry all semester.

Does that seem unfair to anyone else?
Not at all.

MARTIN: Look at him.
BENDER: Nash!

Taking a reverse constitutional?

I'm hoping to extract an algorithm
to define their movement.

Oh.

Psycho.

SOL: I thought you dropped out.
You ever going to go to class or...

Classes will dull your mind.

Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

Oh, I didn't know that.

Nash is going to stun us all
with his genius.

Which is another way of saying
he doesn't have the nerve to compete.

You scared?

Terrified. Mortified. Petrified.

Stupefied by you.

No starch.

Pressed and folded.

Let me ask you something, John.

Be my guest, Martin.

Bender and Sol here correctly completed
Allen's proof of Perron's conjectures.

JOHN: Adequate work...

...without innovation.

I'm flattered. You flattered?
Flattered.

MARTIN: And I've got two weapons briefs
under security review by the DOD.

Derivative drivel.

But Nash achievements: zero.

I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual question coming?

What if you never come up
with your original idea?

MARTIN: How will it feel
when I'm chosen for Wheeler...

...and you're not?

What if you lose?

You should not have won.

Hmm.

I had the first move, my play was perfect.

The hubris of the defeated.

The game is flawed.

MARTIN: Gentlemen, the great John Nash.

CHARLES: You've been in here
for two days.

You know Hansen
has just published another paper?

I can't even find a topic for my doctorate.

Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

This is a group playing touch football.

<i>This is a cluster of pigeons</i>
<i>fighting over breadcrumbs. </i>

<i>And this is a woman who is chasing a man</i>
<i>who stole her purse. </i>

John, you watched a mugging.

That's weird.

In competitive behavior,
someone always loses.

Well, my niece knows that, John,
and she's about this high.

See, if I could derive an equilibrium...

...where prevalence is
a non-singular event...

...where nobody loses.

Imagine the effect that would have
on conflict scenarios...

When did you last eat?

When did you last eat?
Currency exchange?

You know, food.

You have no respect for cognitive reverie,
you know?

Yes. But pizza...

Now, pizza I have enormous respect for.

And, of course, beer.

I have respect for beer.

I have respect for beer!

[Indistinct chatter and laughter]

BENDER: Good evening, Neils.
MARTIN: Hey, Nash.

Who's winning? You or you?

BENDER: Good evening, Nash.
SOL: Hey, guys. Hey, Nash.

WOMAN: He's looking at you for sure.

Hey, Nash.

<i>Neils is trying to get your attention. </i>

BENDER: You're joking.
SOL: Oh, no.

Go with God.
Come back a man.

Fortune favors the brave.
Bombs away.

Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success...

...dramatically improve with each attempt?

This is going to be classic.

Maybe you want to buy me a drink.

I don't know what I'm required to say...

...in order for you
to have intercourse with me...

...but could we assume
that I've said all that?

Essentially we're talking about
fluid exchange, right?

So, could we just go straight to the sex?

Oh, that was sweet.

WOMAN: Have a nice night, asshole!

NEILSON: Ladies, wait!

CHARLES: I especially liked the bit
about fluid exchange. It was...

...really charming.

PROFESSOR: Walk with me, John.

<i>I've been meaning to talk with you. </i>

The faculty is completing mid-year reviews.

We're deciding
which placement applications to support.

Wheeler, sir.
That would be my first choice.

JOHN: Actually, I don't really have
a second choice, sir.

Your fellows have attended classes.
They've written papers. They've published.

I'm still searching, sir, for my...

Your original idea.
Governing dynamics, sir.

It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid
it's just not nearly good enough.

May I?
Thank you.

I'm working on manifold embedding.

My bargaining stratagems
show some promise.

If you could just arrange another meeting
with Professor Einstein.

I've repeatedly asked you for that.

I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...

John.

Do you see what they're doing there?

PROFESSOR 2:
Congratulations, Professor Max.

MAX: Thank you, sir. Thank you.

It's the pens.

Reserved for a member of the department
that makes the achievement of a lifetime.

Now what do you see, John?

Recognition.

Well done, Professor.

Well, try seeing accomplishment.

Is there a difference?

You haven't focused.

I'm sorry, but up to this point, your record
doesn't warrant any placement at all.

Good day.

PROFESSOR:
And my compliments to you, sir.

MAX: Thank you so much.

[Poignant instrumental music]

JOHN: I can't see it.


CHARLES: Jesus Christ, John.

I can't fail.

JOHN: This is all I am.
CHARLES: Come on, let's go out.

I have to get something done.
John!

I can't keep staring into space.
John, enough!

JOHN: Got to face the wall,
follow their rules, read their books...

...do their classes.

Come on! Go on, bust your head!
Kill yourself.

CHARLES: Don't do it. Don't mess around.

Bust your head! Go on,
bust that worthless head wide open.

JOHN: Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is your problem?

It's not my problem.

And it's not your problem.

It's their problem.

CHARLES: Your answer isn't,
"face the wall."

<i>It's out there... </i>

<i>... where you've been working. </i>

[John gasps]

That was heavy.

That Isaac Newton fellow was right.

He was onto something.
Clever boy.


JOHN: Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it in a minute.

CHARLES: [Laughing] Oh, God.

NEILSON: Incoming, gentlemen.
SOL: Ay-yi-yi.

Deep breaths.

SOL: Nash, you might want to stop
shuffling your papers for five seconds.

I will not buy you gentlemen beer.

BENDER: We're not here for beer,
my friend.

JOHN: Oh.

Does anyone else feel
she should be moving in slow motion?

Will she want a large wedding, you think?

Shall we say swords? Pistols at dawn?

Have you remembered nothing?

<i>Recall the lessons of Adam Smith... </i>

...the father of modern economics.

"In competition...

SOL<i>I</i>NEILSON: "...individual ambition
serves the common good."

Every man for himself, gentlemen.

BENDER: Those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

MARTIN: I'm not going to strike out.

SOL: You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

SOL: Nobody move.

<i>She's looking over here. </i>
<i>She's looking at Nash. </i>

MARTIN: Oh, God.
He may have the upper hand now...

<i>... but wait until he opens his mouth. </i>

<i>Remember the last time? </i>

BENDER: That was one
for the history books.

Adam Smith needs revision.
What are you talking about?

If we all go for the blonde...

<i>... we block each other. </i>

<i>Not a single one of us is going to get her. </i>

<i>So then we go for her friends... </i>

<i>... but they will all give us the cold shoulder</i>
<i>because nobody likes to be second choice. </i>

Well, what if no one goes for the blonde?

<i>We don't get in each other's way... </i>

<i>... and we don't insult the other girls. </i>

That's the only way we win.

That's the only way we all get laid.


Adam Smith said:

"The best result comes...

"...from everyone in the group
doing what's best for himself."

Right. Incomplete. Okay?

Because the best result will come...

...from everyone in the group...

...doing what's best for himself...

...and the group.

If this is some way for you
to get the blonde, go to hell.

Governing dynamics. Adam Smith...

...was wrong.

SOL: Here we go.
NEILSON: Careful, careful.

Thank you.

"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T."

[Indistinct muttering]

[Muttering continues]

[Dramatic instrumental music]

You do realize this flies in the face
of 150 years of economic theory?

Yes, I do, sir.

That's rather presumptuous, no?
It is, sir.

Well, Mr. Nash...

<i>... with a breakthrough of this magnitude... </i>

<i>... I'm confident you will get</i>
<i>any placement you like. </i>

<i>Wheeler Labs... </i>

<i>... they'll ask you to recommend</i>
<i>two team members. </i>

PROFESSOR: Stills and Frank
are excellent choices.

Sol and Bender, sir.

Sol and Bender
are extraordinary mathematicians.

Has it occurred to you that Sol and Bender
might have plans of their own?

BENDER: [Laughing] We made it!

Wheeler, we made it!

Cheers, cheers, cheers!

Okay, awkward moment, gentlemen.

Umm...

Governing dynamics.

MARTIN: Congratulations, John.

BENDER: Toast! To Wheeler Labs!
SOL: To Wheeler!

THE PENTAGON 1953 - FIVE YEARS LATER

MAN: General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

Dr. Nash, your coat?

Thank you, sir.

General, this is Wheeler team leader,
Dr. John Nash.

Glad you could come, Doctor.
Hello.

Right this way.

GENERAL: We've been intercepting
radio transmissions from Moscow.

<i>The computer can't detect a pattern, </i>
<i>but I'm sure it's code. </i>

JOHN: Why is that, General?

GENERAL: Ever just know something,
Dr. Nash?

Constantly.

GENERAL: We've developed
several ciphers.

<i>If you'd like to review</i>
<i>our preliminary data? </i>

GENERAL: Doctor?
JOHN: [Voiceover] 6-7-3-7.

<i>0- 3-6... </i>

<i>8- 4-9-4.</i>

<i>9- 1-4-0-3-4.</i>

I need a map.

JOHN: 46-13-08, 67-46-90.

<i>Starkey Corners, Maine. </i>

48-03-01.

91-26-35.

<i>Prairie Portage, Minnesota. </i>

These are latitudes and longitudes.

There are at least 10 others.

They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.

Extraordinary.

Gentlemen, we need to move on this.

Who's Big Brother?
You've done your country a great service.

Captain!
Yes, sir.

Accompany Dr. Nash.

What are the Russians moving, General?

Captain Rogers will escort you
to the unrestricted area, Doctor.

<i>Thank you. </i>

ROGERS: Dr. Nash, follow me, please.

[Over radio] <i>None of those</i>
<i>who said they don't like the method... </i>

<i>... have told us any other method</i>
<i>they could use that would be effective. </i>

DRIVER: It's Dr. Nash.
GUARD: All right.

WHEELER DEFENSE LABS
MIT CAMPUS

Thank you, sir.
Home run at the Pentagon?

Have they actually taken the word
"classified" out of the dictionary?

Hi. The air conditioning broke again.

How am I supposed to be in here
saving the world if I'm melting?

Our hearts go out to you.

Two trips to the Pentagon in four years.

That's two more than we've had.
It gets better.

Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

You know, the Russians have the H-bomb,
the Nazis are repatriating South America...

...the Chinese have a standing army
of 2.8 million...

...and I am doing stress tests on a dam.

You made the cover of <i>Fortune</i> again.

Please note the use of the word "you,"
not "we."

That was supposed to be just me.


Not only do they rob me
of the Fields' Medal...

...they put me on the cover
of <i>Fortune</i> magazine with these hacks...

...these scholars of trivia.

Exactly what's the difference
between genius and most genius?

Quite a lot.

He's your son.
Anyway, you've got 10 minutes.

JOHN: I've always got 10 minutes.
BENDER: Before your new class?

Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?

You are a doctor, John, and no.

You know the drill,
we get these beautiful facilities...

...MIT gets America's great minds of today,
teaching their great minds of tomorrow.

Poor bastards.
Now, have a nice day at school.

The bell is ringing.

[Door opens]

The eager young minds of tomorrow.

[Loud jack-hammering outside]

STUDENT: Can we leave one open,
Professor? It's really hot, sir.

Your comfort comes second
to my ability to hear my own voice.

JOHN: Personally...

<i>... I think this class will be</i>
<i>a waste of your... </i>

<i>... and what is infinitely worse... </i>

...my time.

However, here we are.

So you may attend or not.

You may complete your assignments
at your whim.

<i>We have begun. </i>

Miss.

ALICIA: Excuse me!

ALICIA: Excuse me!
FOREMAN: Hey, hey!

ALICIA: Hi!

<i>We have a little problem. </i>

<i>It's extremely hot in here</i>
<i>with the windows closed... </i>

<i>... and extremely noisy with them open. </i>

<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>if there was any way you could... </i>

<i>... I don't know, maybe work</i>
<i>someplace else for about 45 minutes? </i>

FOREMAN: Not a problem.
ALICIA: Thank you so much!

FOREMAN: Break!
WORKER: Got it!

FOREMAN: Let's go. Clean it up a little bit.

As you will find in multivariable calculus,
there is often...

...a number of solutions
for any given problem.

As I was saying, this problem here...

<i>... will take some of you</i>
<i>many months to solve. </i>

For others among you...

...it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

PARCHER: Professor Nash.

William Parcher.

Big Brother...

<i>... at your service. </i>

What can I do
for the Department of Defense?

Are you here to give me a raise?
Let's take a walk.

Impressive work at the Pentagon.
Yes, it was.

Oppenheimer used to say, "A genius
sees the answer before the question."

You knew Oppenheimer?

His project was under my supervision.

Which project?

JOHN: That project.
PARCHER: It's not that simple.

Well, you ended the war.

We incinerated 150,000 people
in a heartbeat.

Great deeds come at great cost,
Mr. Parcher.

Conviction, it turns out, is a luxury
of those on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

I'll try and keep that in mind.

PARCHER: So, John, no family...

<i>... no close friends. </i>

PARCHER: Why is that?
JOHN: I like to think it's because I'm a Ione wolf.

But mainly it's because
people don't like me.


There are certain endeavors...

...where your lack of personal connection
would be considered an advantage.

JOHN: This is a secure area.
PARCHER: They know me.

PARCHER: Have you ever been here?

JOHN: We were told in our initial briefing
these warehouses were abandoned.

PARCHER: That's not precisely accurate.

[Low radio chatter]

[Dramatic instrumental music]

[Radio transmits Russian speaker]

PARCHER: By telling you this...

<i>... I am increasing your security clearance</i>
<i>to top secret. </i>

Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

Get it?

What operation?

Those are a good idea.

PARCHER: This factory is in Berlin,
we seized it at the end of the war.

<i>Nazi engineers were attempting to build</i>
<i>a portable atomic bomb. </i>

The Soviets reached this facility
before we did, and we lost the damn thing.

The routing orders at the Pentagon.

They were about this, weren't they?

The Soviets aren't as unified
as people believe.

PARCHER: A faction of the Red Army
calling itself <i>Novaya Svoboda</i>...

...the "New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb...

...and intends to detonate it on U.S. soil.

Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

PARCHER: Man is capable of as much atrocity
as he has imagination.

<i>New Freedom has sleeper agents</i>
<i>here in the U.S. </i>

McCarthy is an idiot, but, unfortunately,
that doesn't make him wrong.

<i>New Freedom communicates</i>
<i>to its agents... </i>

...through codes imbedded in newspapers
and magazines...

...and that's where you come in.

<i>You see, John, what distinguishes you... </i>

...is that you are, quite simply...

...the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.

What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?

Commit this list of periodicals to memory.

PARCHER: Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes, decipher them.

DOCTOR: Place your chin on the chin rest.

DOCTOR: Stare into the light.
TECHNICIAN: Pulse 88, regular.

DOCTOR: Okay, this may be
a little uncomfortable.


PARCHER: It's got a little zap to it,
doesn't it?

He just implanted a radium diode.

Don't worry, it's safe.

<i>The isotope decays predictably. </i>

<i>As a result, </i>
<i>these numbers change over time. </i>

They're the access codes to your drop spot.

So what am I now, a spy?

[Knock at door]

JOHN: Come.

Boy, you must be really important.

It's all right, Mike.

What are you working on?

Classified.

Everyone waited half an hour.

JOHN: For?
ALICIA: Class.

<i>You missed class today. </i>

Oh. I suspect that...

...nobody missed me.

ALICIA: The problem
that you left on the board...

...I solved it.

No, you didn't.
You didn't even look.

I never said that the vector fields
were rational functions.

Your solution is elegant.

Though on this particular occasion...

...ultimately incorrect.

You're still here.
I'm still here.

Why?

ALICIA: I'm wondering, Professor Nash...

...if I can ask you to dinner.

You do eat, don't you?

On occasion, yeah.

Table for one.
Prometheus alone chained to the rock...

...with the bird circling overhead,
you know how it is.


No, I expect that you wouldn't know...

Leave your address with my office.
I'll pick you up Friday...

...at 8:00 and we'll eat.

One more thing. Do you have a name,
or should I just keep calling you "miss"?

JOHN: Governor...

...may I present...
Miss Alicia Larde.

PHOTOGRAPHER:
Professor, please. You and the governor.

Wait, one second. I'm sorry.

ALICIA: I want a copy of this.
First big date and all, you know.

<i>So, you boys need to look good... </i>

...which is not a state
you find yourselves in altogether naturally.

There. Better.

I'm surprising him.
You just keep on surprising him.

Professor.

[Ambient party noises]

God must be a painter.

<i>Why else would we have so many colors? </i>

So you're a painter?

That's not actually what I said...

...but, yes, I am.

ALICIA: Here.

Me.

Your date.

Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

ALICIA: [Laughing] That's a plan.

Champagne would be lovely.

<i>I'll be outside. </i>

I will get the champagne.

ALICIA: Oh, thank you.

Thank you for that.

No, keep it.

I believe in deciding things
will be good luck.

Do you?
No.

I don't believe in luck.

But I do believe
in assigning value to things.

Oh.

ALICIA: I once tried to count them all.

I actually made it to 4,348.

You are exceptionally odd.

I bet you're very popular with the girls.

A pair of odd ducks, then.

Mmm.

Pick a shape.

What?

Pick a shape, an animal, anything.

Okay.

An umbrella.

[Poignant instrumental music]

Do it again.

Do it again.

JOHN: All right. What would you like?
ALICIA: Do an octopus.

[Dramatic instrumental music]

[Dog barks]

[Alicia chuckles]

ALICIA: You don't talk much, do you?

JOHN: I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

I don't mean work.

I find that polishing my interactions...

...in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.

I have a tendency
to expedite information flow...

...by being direct.

I often don't get a pleasant result.
Try me.

All right.

I find you attractive.

Your aggressive moves towards me
indicate that you feel the same way.

But still, ritual requires that we continue
with a number of platonic activities...

...before we have sex.

I am proceeding with those activities...

...but in point of actual fact...

...all I really want to do is have intercourse
with you as soon as possible.

Are you going to slap me now?

How was that result?

MARCEE: What are you doing?

Trying to isolate patterned reoccurrences
within periodicals over time.

And you?

You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

Do I know you?

My uncle says you're very smart
but not very nice...

...so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

And who might your uncle be?

CHARLES: The prodigal roommate...

...returns.


JOHN: Come here, Charles.

My sister got herself killed in a car crash.

Not too far now, Marcee!

<i>Her cowboy husband was too drunk</i>
<i>to know that he was too drunk to drive. </i>

So, I took her in.

She's so small.
She's young. That's how they come.

I'm at Harvard...

...doing the great author's workshop.

D.H. bloody Lawrence.

I really do think
you should buy yourself a new book.


CHARLES: Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.

How are you, John?

At first, all my work here was trivial...

...but a new assignment came up and...

I can't really tell you any details.

Top secret? Black bag? Black ops?

Something like that.

And...
Yes?

Well, I met a girl.

No! A human girl?
Homo sapien.

A biped?
Yep. And contrary to all probabilities...

...she finds me attractive
on a number of different levels.

God, that's wonderful.

There's no accounting for taste, is there?

Should I marry her?
Oh, God. Right.

I mean, everything's going well.
The job is fine. I have enough money.

It all seems to add up.

But how do you know for sure?

Nothing's ever for sure, John.

That's the only sure thing I do know.

WAITER: Good evening.

JOHN: Alicia, please don't be angry.
I just lost track of time at work...

JOHN: . . Again.
ALICIA: Mm-hmm.

I'm sorry.

I didn't have time to wrap it.

Happy birthday.

JOHN: The refractive faces of the glass
create a full wavelength dispersal...

<i>... so if you look inside, you can see... </i>

ALICIA: Every possible color.
JOHN: Every possible color.

Yeah.

Remember you said that time, God must
be a painter because of all the colors?

At the governor's house you said that.

I didn't think you were listening.

I was listening.

It's beautiful.

[Both chuckle]

Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?

Because I need some kind of proof,
some kind of verifiable, empirical data.

[Nervous laughter]

I'm sorry, just give me a moment...

...to redefine my girlish notions
of romance.

A proof?

Verifiable data.

Okay.

Well, how big is the universe?

Infinite.

ALICIA: How do you know?

Because all the data indicates it.
But it hasn't been proven yet?

You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?

I don't, I just believe it.

It's the same with love, I guess.

Now...

...the part that you don't know...

...is if I want to marry you.

[Indistinct chatter and laughter]


Smile for the camera!

Well done!

Congratulations.

WOMAN: You look beautiful.

SOL: Hi, how are you?

WOMAN: Bye-bye.
MAN: 'Bye, now.

<i>Be safe! </i>

[Gate opens]

CAMBRIDGE, MA - OCTOBER 1954

Get in. Hurry.

They're following us.

Who is following us?
The drop has been compromised.

PARCHER: Get down!

Stay down.

[Horns honking]

[Tires screeching]


PARCHER: Take this.
JOHN: I ain't shooting anybody.

Take the goddamn gun!
No!


PARCHER: You stay back. Don't move.


[Tires screech]

ALICIA: John?

Hi.

Where were you?

JOHN: Sol...
ALICIA: Yeah, I talked to Sol.

<i>He said you left the office hours ago. </i>

Why didn't you call me?

Are you all right?

ALICIA: Honey?

[Bolt locks]

ALICIA: John...

...please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

<i>John, open the door. </i>

Come on, open the door! Let me in!

Talk to me!

John!

ALICIA: [Shouts] Open this door!


WOMAN: Watch for cars, kids.

[Door bangs shut]

PARCHER: John.

William.

<i>This is not what I signed up for. </i>

Every time a car backfires or a door slams...

I understand better
than you could possibly imagine.

You need to calm down, John.

PARCHER: Now listen.
We're closing in on the bomb...

<i>... in large part due to your work. </i>

Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?

William, my circumstance has changed.

Alicia's pregnant.

I told you attachments were dangerous.

<i>You chose to marry the girl. </i>

<i>I did nothing to prevent it. </i>

The best way to ensure
everybody's safety...

...is for you to continue your work.

Well, I'll just quit.

You won't.

Why would I not?

Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

<i>You quit working for me... </i>

...I quit working for you.

Parcher!

SOL: John, you all right?

ALICIA: John?

JOHN: [Angrily]
Turn it off! Turn off the light!

Why would you do that?

Why would you turn the light on?
What is wrong with you?

You have to go to your sister's.

JOHN: I left the car out in back.
Take Commonwealth, no side streets.

Stay where it's crowded.

ALICIA: John, I'm not going anywhere!

JOHN: When you get to your sister's,
wait for my call.

Get your things.
I'm not leaving!

Stop! Stop it!

JOHN: Please, Alicia.

I'll explain when I can.

[Dramatic instrumental music]

HARVARD UNIVERSITY
NATIONAL MATHEMATICS CONFERENCE

MARCEE: Uncle John!

<i>Uncle John! </i>


Hey, baby girl! [Marcee giggles]

Wow, someone needed a hug!

I saw you on the slate,
and I thought to myself:

"How can I miss seeing a guest lecture
by the inimitable John Nash?"

CHARLES: What's wrong?

I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

Now you tell me, what is it?

WOMAN: Professor Nash!

Welcome!

After?

JOHN: So, we see that the zeroes
of the Riemann Zeta function...

...correspond to singularities...

<i>... in space-time... </i>

Singularities in space-time then...

And conventional number theory...

It breaks down
in the face of relativistic exploration.

[Ominous instrumental music]

Sometimes our expectations
are betrayed by the numbers.

Variables are impossible
to assign any rational value.

MAN: Professor Nash!
