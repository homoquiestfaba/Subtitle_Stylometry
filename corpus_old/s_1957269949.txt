Hi.

Tag, you're it.

Oh, sh--

Hey.

Hey, I'm driving this
gigantic truck I just got.

Come out to the curb.

Yeah, I'm already on the curb.

I'll see you in a sec.

Can't believe this is
the last of it already.

Yup.

So you want me to use the truck
to drop you off at work?

You need the truck for the
last bit of the stuff, right?

Yeah, but what if your
car doesn't start again?

That won't happen, but if
it does, I'll ride my bike.

The truck is a gift to you.

Oh?

You deserve a gift. You're
starting work tomorrow.

Well, it's just another
dog training client.

Yeah, well, you'll find
something else soon.

Yeah, I just feel like I'm taking a step
backwards training people's dogs again.

I'm sorry, it's--it's
not your fault.

Well, technically no.

Well, I mean, I guess
I'd be more excited

if I felt like you were more
excited that I came back.

Hold on.

We're re-doing the phone call.

What?

Here, you're in Chicago, I'm in L.A.,
you're telling me you're moving.

All right.

Aren't you gonna answer?

Never on the first ring.

Hello?

Hi. It's me.

Hey, kind of a bad time.

Did you have something
you wanted to tell me?

Yes.

I miss you and I'm moving back.

I'm leaving my job.

That is exciting news.

I can't wait.

I love you.

I can't wait for you to be here.

Thank you. I

believe you.

Good.

All right, now we can drive.

Okay, 'cause that
was ridiculous.

Everything in my brain tells me that
she doesn't deserve a second chance.

You know, but it's my mom,

it's like something in
my gut tells me I just

need to make up with her and start over.
I can't shake it.

Harry, try to think of your gut instincts
as you, on your death bed, um,

sending a message back in time.

You can-- It's okay.

You can argue with your
instincts all you want,

you can try to outthink
them but in the end,

you're only gonna hurt yourself if
you don't at least acknowledge them.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Harry, we're really
on to something.

No, no, I know we are, but if
you're gonna show up late,

you at least gotta
shower or something.

I mean, you look
like you got TB.

Sorry, I just-- I had
to ride my bike here.

My car wouldn't start and I was
moving somebody this morning.

Moving? Are you a
moving guy or a shrink?

He was helping my daughter move.

He's been a good boyfriend.

They've been together
for seven years.

Six years.

Six years.

That's exciting.

Yeah, I just I didn't
realize that when I was

letting you sit in on
my therapy sessions

that I pay for that that
it was a family thing.

How are you doing with
your night terrors?

I just didn't realize that he's here
because he's humping your daughter.

Excuse me.

Dude!

Whoa!

Watch where you're going!
You almost killed me!

Are you okay?

Yeah, no, I'm fine, just kind
of rolled the knee a little.

Here.

I will give you the
kind of moral support

that only a stranger can provide to
you, while I wait. While you wait.

Well-well, thank you.

You're welcome.

I'm Johnny Knoxville,
by the way.

It's nice to meet you, Johnny.

Ben actually.

So, Ben, are you always
this uncoordinated

or is it like a Clark
Kent kind of thing

where it's an act to cover
up your superpowers?

Yeah, actually that's
exactly what it is.

Yeah?

Yeah. Yeah, I used to do the
glasses thing, you know,

but then I just started
amping up the number of times

I throw myself off moving
objects every day.

I like that.

Actually, I was
kind of distracted.

I was watching this girl read
a book over by that tree.

I do have pretty good book reading
skills though so, thanks for noticing.

You should see me
dunk, really good.

Really? Like basketball?

Yeah.

Wow.

Hmm. How tall are you?

You don't believe me?

I'm good, I'm really good.
I play every day.

Okay.

They're naming the
courts after me.

-Really? What, these courts?
-Yeah,

yeah. Nadia's Courts of Wonder.

Hmm, okay. I can buy that.

Wow. Well, thank you.

You're welcome.

Look at that.

Started right up, I didn't even
do nothing, I looked at it.

Of course it starts now,
I have nowhere to go.

You're still gonna get me courtside
tickets for Friday's game?

Why? Why would I do that?

I just fixed your car.

You fixed nothing,
you looked at it.

I looked right at it!

That-- you know--

And it works.

Looking at it counts
for nothing, sorry.

I'm a Jedi.

No, you can do that on your own dime.
You did nothing but look.

Whatev. How'd, uh,
move-in day go?

Good, went well. Except for
me having to convince her

that I'm actually happy
about her moving back.

Ouch.

What?

You got that girl's number
at the park, didn't you?

What? No.

Ben?

What?

I'm gonna tell your mother.

I've met her, I've met
your mom, she loves me.

She'll believe anything I say.

There's nothing to tell.
I didn't get her number.

I'm--I'm a happily
girlfriended man.

You talked to her for
five solid minutes.

I'm sure she was just hideous.

I don't know.

A beast.

She very well could have been.

Could have looked like
you for all I know.

You wish.

Oh, dude, did you show
her the magic trick?

No, I did not try the magic trick.
I don't care--

Why not?

I don't care if it works.
I'm not doing--I'm not--

It always works.

I'm not becoming that guy.

It works every time.

What works?

Start it?

Uh, yeah, seems to be.

It was working just fine
until you showed up.

Good to know.

So you'll take it in tomorrow?

I still don't know why you didn't just call
me for a ride to work, man, I'm like--

How are you gonna
give me a ride?

You barely fit on your moped.

Okay, Amy, you're
obviously bad luck.

Get 50 feet from the premises.

Ben,

let's start this car. We
can do this, go team.

Okay.

You don't deserve this bike.

Someone should take this
bike away from you.

Hey!

Uh.

You okay?

Uh, um, I'm okay.

Well, you know, I'm pretty good at making
people forget about their bad dreams.

Really?

Mm-hmm.

What is that-- is
that your superpower?

Superpower?

Yeah, well, are you the
nightmare destroyer?

Uh, all right, I guess.

And that happened one
time with one person.

That's just a stupid
thing to say.

Okay, Tammy, let's not get back into the
affair, at least not for right now.

What about him makes
you feel he's absent?

He doesn't look at me the
way that he used to.

It's like he's replaying a movie
in his head or something.

I have a stressful job.

You're a butcher!

You try carving animals up all day
and tell me it doesn't affect you!

There was a pig yesterday
that reminded me of Harrison.

I'm sorry, um, who's Harrison?

Cat.

Our cat.

May I ask something?

Uh, Tammy, when you
feel like he is absent,

are you worried that maybe he's thinking
about the woman he had an affair with?

I don't know, maybe.

Maybe these issues
are connected.

We're gonna need some more friends
for Texas hold 'em, you know that?

Eh. I got plenty of friends, man. They all
just think they're too cool for poker night.

Hmm. What are they doing
that's so cool right now?

Knowing those guys, probably
off playing tug-a-bros.

What is tug-a-bros?

Oh, it's great. It's
when two dudes--

No! Just-- I don't
want to hear about it.

Oh yeah, you're
married, that's right.

I'm not marr-- I'm
not even engaged.

You've discussed when this
is gonna happen though.

Well, kind-kind of, yeah.

You have a date picked out.

Yeah, well, March
of next year was--

it was thrown around
out a little bit but--

A particular Saturday in March?

The tenth.

You're married, dude.

That's good though, I'm
glad, I'm glad for you.

I'm glad things are good.

There's one, maybe one slight problem but
problem's maybe too strong of a word.

You like dudes.

No.

Big hairy dudes.

It's, uh, the girl.

I keep having this dream
about her, like, not like--

just a dream about her, it's like the
same dream though, like, every night.

Stop dreaming about her.

Doesn't seem to be that easy.

Do you love Amy?

Yeah.

Then quit dreaming
about park girl.

You've been together
what, six years?

She's gorgeous and
she is cool as hell.

And you've got a sweet
job working for her dad.

Just

hold it together.

I will--okay, I'll
hold it together.

Hold it together, Ben.

I'm holding it. I'll stop, I'll
stop dreaming. Let's-- yeah.

Okay, and checkmate.

It smells nice in here.

So your grandma's cool with us
using her place as a poker den?

She's out of town for like 3
months, I rule the roost.

All right.

Well, fix me a vodka prune.

I can do a vodka prune.

Nice.

Coming right up.

Hmmm.

Why are you so old?

I mean, I should have winned by
now 'cause I took your king.

Honk, honk.

Honk, honk.

Hey. I know you.

Yes, wow.

Hi.

Hi.

How's your knee?

What? Oh, my knee, it's fine.
Yeah.

I assumed it gave out again

and you spent the last few
months in a cast or something.

Yeah. I did, it's been brutal.
Do you live around here?

No. Actually I just
moved up to Sacramento.

Oh, so what are you--
what are you doing here?

I guess that is kind
of weird, isn't it?

I guess I jogged like 300 miles.

Okay. Oh, well, as
confusing as that is,

it's, uh, it's good to
see you again in person.

Usually it's through long
lens photography... ?

Yeah. No, I--um--

This is gonna sound stupid.

No, no, you can sound stupid in front
of me, I'm basically a stranger.

Okay. Uh, well, I've just have
been having this recurring dream

where you're shooting
hoops in the park.

So I mean, I don't
know why, it's just--

it's weird I know, we
just met the one time

but I'm sure the trauma of like
a bike accident, you know,

and being laughed at by a pretty
girl which was fine but...

Hello?

Oh, no, I'm coming
now, I'm sorry.

Uh, I'll be there
in like 10 minutes.

I know.

I'm just going for a
jog, I ended up in L.A.

Okay, well, what time are
you gonna get there?

Hey, next time, you let
him steal your bike.

Who's that? Ben, who is that?

Ben?

What?

You're up.

Forgot you gave me a key?

Good thing you didn't have
some hussy in your bed, huh?

Yeah.

I made breakfast,
blueberry pancakes.

Oh, I have pancake stuff?

Well, I brought the blueberries.

I figured if you're taking me to a fancy
restaurant, I should make you breakfast.

Yeah, what's the difference
between Zopiclone and Drixoral?

Hello, just thought you might be a girl that
gave me her number in a dream last night.

Sorry to bother you, sir.

No, I'm not insane.

Have a nice day.

Ah, screw it.

Hi, this is Nadia.

Please leave a mess--

Perfect timing. Oh, my God.

I saw that.

No, you didn't.

Yeah. We're meeting here
so you can propose?

Yeah--not here, here, like in the
restaurant for lunch, here as a surprise.

I'm sorry.

I'm totally blowing it.

I mean, I was kind of expecting it
anyway, but this is really blowing it.

It's fine. Let-- we-- just-- we
can forget this ever happened,

we can just-- we can have lunch or
talk and another time we'll do this.

You're so flustered.

Of course I'm flustered, you
caught me, you saw the box.

Now you're gonna have to
act surprised in there.

Well, then just do
it some other time.

Well, now you're gonna know, you're gonna
like expect it if I take you anywhere.

No, I won't.

You will if I bend down to tie my
shoe or something, you'll freak out.

Then just do it now.

What, just-- what here?

Yeah.

This is gross, this--there's a trash can.
It's not very romantic.

Really, I don't care, I just
want to see the ring now.

-Really?
-Yeah.

What are you doing?

What?

You can't just whip it out!

Oh, right. Of course, sorry.
Okay.

Um,

all right.

Amy, the last, uh, six--

the last six years,
um, of my, uh--

I had this planned
out, I promise.

It's okay.

Um, it'll come back to me
inside, I'm sure it has to.

Does the concrete
hurt your knee?

A little.

Yeah.

Amy, will you marry me?

Yes, yes, yes. Oh,
my God, I love it.

Aww.

Yeah!

There he is.

Here I am.

You're a good man.

Well, thank you.

Have you ever had a
really good scotch?

No.

Sit down.

So what do you think about
taking over my practice?

What?

I know I said that I thought I had a few
more years in me, but lately, I don't know.

Well, I-I would love to, I
don't expect it or anything.

Susan's getting antsy, she's talking
about living in Europe or something.

I'm not there, but I
do want to travel.

Well, I'm shocked.

You're not that shocked, you know
I've been grooming you for this.

I can't think of a better
person to hand the reins to.

You should grow some scruff or something,
though, so people take you more seriously.

Okay. I'll try.

So...

is she the girl of your dreams?

Uh... I'm sorry. Let me...

These freaking cell phones.

Hello?

Hey, I missed a call
from this number.

Uh, this is Ben. You gave me your
number yesterday-- er, last night.

I did? Um...

That's the thing. I'm not-- I'm
not exactly sure how, um...

You know, I think you
have the wrong number.

So let me get this straight.

Goofy girl from the park
shows up in your dream

and gives you her phone number,

and you are crazy enough to remember it
and call her when you wake up today.

Yes.

Uh-huh.

And you believe it was her
that answered the phone

even though whoever that
was said she was not her.

But her voicemail said Nadia.

Voicemail?

'Cause voicemail is the word of God.
Remind me,

did you not just get engaged to be married
today - to the lovely Amy Randall?

Yes, that was also today.

Okay. So that's that.

Okay. But what are the odds that I
would just randomly call a Nadia?

No, no, no, no more dream
girl stuff, all right?

Just what are the odds?
What are the odds?

In Sacramento, one in 2,500.

But what are the odds that you would
get a stranger's correct phone number

while you're in REM sleep and your
girlfriend's in the next room

cooking you blueberry pancakes,

what are those odds? One in 18 million?
Maybe 19 million.

All right, I need to stop.

I gotta-I gotta stop thinking
about her, connecting with her.

There's something about
her, man, she's like...

basketball and...

Ben, stop that. Did you not
get engaged to Amy today?

It was today, yes.

Then why are you here hanging out
with me in my grandmother's house?

Dr. Hinton.

Hi.

Hi, Ben.

Um, do you have any
time to get together?

Sure. What time?

Like, now?

So do you like doing sessions
out of your house now?

Oh, I love it, it's great.

It's so much easier.

Everything okay?

Yeah, I just, uh...

There's something
kind of happening.

It's a little different, I
guess, I just wanted to--

I thought maybe you'd be a good
person to talk to about it.

Sorry.

One second.

Dr. Hinton.

Eddie, are you all right?

Are you having a hallucination?

Do
you want me to call 911?

Listen to me, I want
you to do me a favor.

I want you to sit down,
take a deep breath.

And we've talked about
this before, Eddie.

They're not real. Do you think you're
gonna be able to make your 4 o'clock?

'Cause I'm with a patient. All right.
You'll be okay.

I'll see you at 4 o'clock then.
Okay, bye-bye.

Sorry.

If I was your patient
and a therapist...

So?

So I... I asked Amy
to marry me today.

Oh! Oh, honey! Oh, that's great.
Congratulations.

Thank you.

Well, she said yes, didn't she?

Yeah.

Well, try to look excited.
Stop furrowing.

Sorry, that's just, you
know, it's a big day.

Yes, it is. Oh, James
would be so proud of you.

Oh, thanks. You think?

Of course, of course.
I wish he was here.

Me too.

You know he was exactly your
age when we got married?

Re-- no, I didn't know that.

Mm-hm. So now you finally
know what true love is.

Ooh, honey, look at this.

The Paradise Mountain,

a series of graceful arches

invite you through a covered front
porch into the large main hall

where the reception takes place.

In the 1940s, the site was a brothel
operated by gangster Mickey Cohen.

That was in the '40s,
gives it character.

It's in Sacramento?

Yeah.

Hmm, no. I don't like that,
that's not gonna work.

What's wrong with it?
My aunt lives there.

Yeah, I don't know.
Sacramento, it's-- no.

"Where you getting married?"
"Sacramento", it sounds-- that's gross.

Okay, well, we could go
somewhere more exotic.

Yeah, I don't know,
something, it's just--

It's like, it sounds
like a body part.

Okay, well, we can keep looking.

Playing horse by yourself?

Hey, asshole, you're gonna
kill somebody with this thing.

Seemed like that bike was just
getting you into trouble anyway.

I guess.

Ladies first.

Thank you.

Oh. Nice shot.

Thanks.

So you're a shrink, huh?

Yes, I am.

You're taking over
for Amy's dad.

Good luck with the new practice.

Yeah, thanks.

Did you always want to do that?

Um...

I don't know.

I went to the army for a few years after
high school and then realized I hated it.

That's cool.

And then just kind of
fell into psych, I guess.

How about you?

You tell me.

Tell you?

Tell me what I do.

You're a headhunter.

That's right.

Sounds dangerous.

Like hiring people
for businesses.

Ah.

Although I could take someone out too
if you need it. For the right price.

So why did you say I had the
wrong number when I called you?

Well, my boyfriend
was next to me.

You're engaged, aren't you?

Yeah.

I am.

So how do we know these
things about each other?

You don't see the pattern here?

You're not even here right now.

This bike sucks.

Is Amy keeping you up at night?

Don't answer that.

Okay. All right, well...

I'll call.

Yes, I'm not gonna call.

Okay, I'll call.

Hello.

Oh, hello.

What are you doing?

Uh, just kind of standing here
wondering what the hell is going on.

How about you?

Pretty much the
exact same thing.

So that was...

So that was you, you were
there just a few minutes ago.

Playing horse with you, yeah.

And the guy tried
to steal my bike.

But you let him this time.

Right, so you've dreamed times
where I didn't let him?

Every night.

How is this happening? I
don't-- I don't understand.

I don't know. I gave you my number
in a dream and then you called me.

So where are you? Can we,
like, meet up or something?

Well, I just moved to
Sacramento, remember?

Oh, right. I was hoping
that part was just me.

I have to go.

Sure, uh, all right...

Those candles are
quite expensive.

You would not believe if I
told you what they cost.

So when's everybody
else getting here?

Funny you should ask.

I'm very good at magic.

Yeah, I could probably blow
your mind with a trick or two.

All right, show me one.

Hold out your hands.

Your taste in dÃ©cor is...

interesting.

Well, I'm an old soul.

Now

I want you to concentrate
very intensely

on how many hands you have.

It should still be two.

Should it?

Uh,

one second, this isn't over.

Give me a second to, uh,
take care of something.

Don't you dare. I'm
about to put on

a closing move

and you are ruining my life.

Love, Mark.

Yeah, that's all taken care of.

Now where were we?

Mark! Mark, it was-- It was her.

Come on in.

It's her, it was her number. She's
in the dreams, she's like with me.

We're like connected, like
we read each other's minds

in the dream. Like I know stuff about
her and she knows stuff about me.

This is Amanda, by the way.

Oh, hi. I'm Ben.

But, so I called her
and it was her number

but she said it wasn't 'cause
her boyfriend was there.

Uh, I have an idea.

You should go call your fiancÃ©e.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's-- okay.

It was nice meeting you.

Just wanted you to know it is
her number, so I'm not crazy.

Clearly.

Have a nice...

candles.

He's a sweetheart.

Isn't he the therapist?

Yeah, and he's quite good.

Oh, these are beautiful.

Thank you. You know, I
really love what I do.

Oh, that's great.

So is it just you or is it like
you have a crew of photographers?

Well, we have different
photographers

that will follow the bride
and some for the groom,

just really depends
on what you want,

how many people you have,
you know, certain--

Who's that?

I don't know. I'll see.

Sorry.

No, don't worry about it.

But we have different
packages you can choose from

but you know you can't put a price tag
on the most special day of your life.

You're way too pretty for that.

Hey, you got a delivery.

Uh, yeah.

If you could just
sign right here--

Shh, shh, yeah, okay. Thank you.

Right there.

Yeah, I just want to-- I
ordered two of these,

I just want to make sure
I ordered the right--

Yeah, this is the-- Okay.

Dream suppressors, this
is the right one, cool.

Wait, if I just
suppress my dreams--

No, I need to control my dreams,

I need to dream about driving a Ferrari
or hanging out at the White House

or shooting hoops with a pro
basketball player or something, right?

I mean, 'cause if she's
still having the dreams

and I'm still having the dreams
and I just don't remember,

that's not good--
This makes no sense.

No. If you could just
sign right here.

Okay.

I shot that in Santa Barbara.

You know, do you
like that backlight?

Yeah, I love
everything about that.

It's beautiful. Yeah.

Um, who was that?

Oh, I don't know,
just wrong number--

house, wrong house, it was a
delivery guy, I don't know.

-Okay.
-So do you do engagement photos, too?

Absolutely. And we also love to go
to the location you're engaged at.

Did you propose locally?

-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

Great. Where was it?

Just...

parking lot.

Yeah.

You know these photos are also
from Santa Barbara as well.

Yeah.

And there's a little different
lighting but if you...

Germany came out of
the League of Nations in 1933.

Hitler began to
systematically undermine

and eradicate the provisions
of the Versailles treaty,

the disarmament clauses and
been long since abandoned

and Hitler achieved
a minor victory

and he withdrew Germany from
the League of Nations--

No.

You know, we could
meet in other places.

Or do you just love
parks and fields?

I kept thinking it was you
that must be into them.

Whatcha reading?

An encyclopedia, I guess.

Reading about Nazis?

Apparently.

Okay. That's pleasant.

I do like the letter N though.

Nadia.

Nad--hmm, let me read that.

Nadia,

a strange girl that haunts your dreams.
May be armed and dangerous.

It doesn't say that!

It does.

All right, well, let's see
what it says about you.

I won't be in there,
that's the N book.

No.

It's the B book.

Oh, how did you do that?

Ben, cute, uncoordinated, quit the
army 'cause he couldn't take it.

Ouch.

I didn't quit the army, I just
got out, soon as I could.

That's right.

So how do we know things
about each other?

'Cause we're here.

Where is here, exactly?

I know you.

I've always known you.

Did you ever dream
about me as a kid?

Yeah,

I did. I always
wondered who you were.

We used to run
around on the beach,

in the woods, at the playground.

Did we take over a
mini golf course?

Yes. We were, like, 10.

We stormed it and we took it over,
we had giant clubs and swords.

All of a sudden there was a moat
around it and nobody could get in.

We ran that joint.

We did.

How did it end?

I don't remember. I assume lots
of mini golf happened, but...

I wonder how this is gonna end.

Are those your dog
tags from the army?

Oh,

yeah, they are.

You've never done this with
anyone else before, have you?

No.

This is new.

Trust me.

Eight, nine, ten, eleven...

That's you.

Yeah.

This was my backyard growing up.

Twenty. Ready or
not, here I come.

Oh, yeah.

He ditched me.

Who?

My brother.

He locked me out for a
long time and I cried.

I'm sorry.

It's all right.

Show me something.

This works.

Is this where you grew up?

Yeah, it is.

Do we get to find a
little you in there, too?

I guess.

Come on.

The other dinosaurs eat
this one because it--

because it looks like waffles.

Oh, you're adorable.

Just like I remember you.

You really loved him.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

You lost him.

Yeah.

You wanted to serve like he did.

I didn't realize that when I,

when I said that you couldn't take it.
I-- I hadn't seen it.

That's okay.

C-can we go somewhere else?

Yeah.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

I wonder what's in our picnic.

You want some?

I don't know, I feel like
we're gonna get busted.

Busted?

Yeah, we're both
in relationships.

This is a dream, remember?
We're asleep.

Don't say that.

What's wrong?

Last time you said that things
unraveled and I woke up.

Uh-oh.

You better kiss me.

Yeah.

Why haven't you?

'Cause I know when I do that,
there's no going back.

No, no.

-Come on, Ben.
-Stop.

Remember when I showed
you this at camp?

No, no, no, no.

It's your favorite magic trick.

No, stop.

Where did you go?

Sorry.

How's this even possible?

I don't know.

We only met once.

I need to see you.

Ben,

I don't think--

I know, I just-- I feel like, I just
need to see you once more, in person.

Why? You're engaged.

I don't know, there's got
to be some reason for this.

You need to live your life, Ben.

I have a life too.

Whatever this is, I'm sure it'll pass
and we'll just be able to move on.

All right, well, I gotta
get back to work.

Okay.

All right, I guess
I'll talk to you...

I don't know if we should
keep talking on the phone.

Hey, Harry Wendell has
agreed to do the one on one,

he's coming in at 3:00.
You good with that?

I'm a leader at my job.
I have to do things,

I've got people who look up to me,
I have a reputation to uphold.

Sure, well.

Just tell yourself I'd like to do
things well but I don't have to.

Okay.

Try saying it.

I'd like to do things
well but I don't have to.

How do you feel
when you say that?

Still feel like I have to.

Well, let's say if you lost
your reputation, then what?

I'd like to keep it.

Sure, but

is that needed for your success?

I suppose.

What makes you successful?

Me?

Yeah, I mean, is it
your job, your wife?

FiancÃ©e.

FiancÃ©e.

Is it 'cause of the gig here?
The old man?

No.

How do you know she's the one?

Umm.

Okay, let's--

I want to get back. Let's
not waste your hour.

All right, fine.

Have you gotten in
touch with your mom?

No.

Hi, sorry. I just have to grab...
one thing...

Oh, hey, we were just talking
about your daughter.

No, not really.

Yeah, really, we were. That's
all we've been talking about.

That is a half truth.
We touched on...

Yeah, he certainly touched
on your daughter.

Well, it's not my session.

So are you doing this
for college credit

or you just always dreamt of
being a second rate therapist?

Okay, I...

I need to tell you something.

I want to be married.

I...

I love you, Amy.

It's not my fault, I just--

I didn't choose this.
I just-- I-I dream.

I can't control my dreams.
You've been...

my partner.

She'll be cool 'cause she loves you and
she'll understand and she'll kill you.

Mark's a good friend of mine,
so I won't charge you much.

Oh, cool, thanks. I
appreciate that.

Mark said you got engaged a few months ago.
Congratulations.

I did. Thank you, yeah, it's...
great.

So she's giving
you trouble, huh?

No, I mean, it's not
her, it's completely me.

She's great, I want to marry her,
I completely want to marry her.

She's beautiful, she's
a wonderful fiancÃ©e

but there's this thing happening
with this other girl and it's--

No, no, not like
hap-- not happening,

I'm not doing stuff, it's
like, it's all in the dream.

I don't know what Mark told
you exactly but that's--

it's completely like
that and I'm gonna stop,

I'm gonna tell Amy everything.

I just have to fess up and then
just like see what happens, right?

That's what-- she's my fiancÃ©e,
I-- You would do-- do it--

would you, would you--

Yeah, no, so I
shouldn't, should I not?

I shouldn't tell her.

So she's giving
you trouble, huh?

Yes, I think it's the starter.

She'll do that.

All righty, give
me half an hour.

We'll see what we can do.

Oh, gotta go, he's here.

Okay.

Bye.

Who was that?

I was talking about my dress which
you're not supposed to know about.

Not that I could do it justice.

They're expensive for a reason
and trust me, it's worth it.

You want to know
how much it costs?

Not really.

Five.

Five, what?

That's a lot, right?

Well, my dad paid for it.
So it's on its way.

What, $5,000?

Oh, and he put a deposit
down on the location today.

It's non refundable, so
can't change our minds now.

Non refundable?

You said you like
the Herald Gardens

and the deposit was
more than the dress.

Can we go inside?

Why? Do you need to
use the bathroom?

No.

Okay. Well, then let's go.
I'm starving.

Amy, I've been dreaming--

I just got a picture
of my dress.

Oh, you can't see this.

Amy, okay.

Look, before you or your dad spend
any more money on this wedding,

you need to understand,
there are things

that happen to me
that I can't control.

Ben?

There are things...

Ben, don't worry about
the money, okay?

My dad is happy to
pay for everything.

He loves me, he loves
you, he loves us.

Every time you get close to a
big thing, you doubt yourself.

Just believe in yourself, okay?

I shouldn't have told you how
much the dress costs, I'm sorry.

Okay. It's not about the dress. It's
not-it's not the deposit. It's me, okay?

Do you want to get takeout
and go over budgets

or do actually want
to go out with me?

Hmm?

You waiting for someone?

I feel like I want to
say something but...

it's silly, 'cause I don't even
know what this is, you know?

You don't have to.

Is this it?

What do you mean?

We...

We can't keep doing
this forever.

We're cheating.

Well...

well, no, it's not--

It's not that simp--
I mean, we're--

Look, I don't even-- we're not
even really here right now.

Don't say that.

Why?

It's gonna go away.

It won't go away.

We just have to keep
moving, remember?

There's something about
the way you look at me.

It's so full, like there's
so much behind it.

How do I make you feel?

Home.

Wow.

What?

I just-- I was expecting
a list of things, it's--

It's perfect.

Why don't you ever ask
me about my boyfriend?

I like to pretend
he doesn't exist.

This is the only
place I see you.

What about when you get married?

When you have kids?

Are we still gonna do be
doing this every night?

I don't know.

You need a clarity moment.

That's how all big
decisions happen, right?

My grandpa used to say that.

Everything becomes
clear in one moment.

And you just know
that it's right.

I like that.

I need to let you go, Ben.

What do you mean?

I need to try to
dream alone again.

I need to try not
to see you anymore.

W-Why? Why would you do that?

You know why.

Goodbye, Ben.

Goodbye? I don't
want to say goodbye.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Don't do this.

Nadia?

Nadia?

I'm right-- can you see me?

Nadia?

Come on, Ben, where'd
you put your phone?

Where's the phone?

Hey.

Is that my phone?

Who's Nadia?

Uh...

"I felt like I was
flying last night."

"I can still feel you."

Okay, I understand, obviously,

it looks like I'm cheating
or something, I'm not.

What is it then? There
are tons more in here!

I'm not cheating on you.

Yes, you are!

I've seen her once in
real life, that's it.

Real life, what does
that even mean?

She's... I can't
explain it, she's--

Don't bother.

It's not, uh...

look, I'm not saying I'm
completely innocent, okay?

I've done--

I-- I'm not cheating on
you though, I'm not.

Don't give me that shit.
I saw the texts!

You're sleeping with her.

S-sleeping? I'm not
sleeping with her.

I've touched her one time
on the hand, that was it.

Do you think I'm an idiot?

I mean, I see the way you look
at me now and it's not the same.

And I thought you were just
nervous about the wedding-

Amy...

-or maybe you didn't
know if you loved me.

Amy, I-I'm telling you, I see
her when I sleep, that's it.

You can't respect our
relationship, obviously,

but you could at least respect me
and not treat me like I'm stupid.

Here.

No, you know what?

You cheated on me, I'm taking it.
I'll sell it.

Hey, wait, wait. Call,
call Mark, he knows.

Don't.

Ben?

Mom, when I came here
before and I told you

that I proposed to
Amy, there was more.

I was gonna ask you something
but I didn't want to.

I thought you would think I
was crazy or hallucinating,

like your crazy client,
that Eddie guy.

Okay.

I might be crazy, I could
be, I could be hallucina--

What do you mean? W-w-what
are you hallucinating?

When I sleep, I dream, I connect
with-with this girl Nadia

and I'm completely in love with her.
And we, like we don't do anything-

-Ben...
-it's just--

it's all-it's all in our dreams.

And I completely deserve
what just happened to me.

Amy just broke my phone--

Ben, Ben, Ben, slow down.

I'm sorry but this
is inappropriate.

These are my office hours.

What? Your office hour--
What are you kidding?

I'm supposed to schedule
a session with my mom?

I may have just lost two
girls in the period of

-this morning.
-Ben.

-I need your help, mom.
-Benjamin!

Hey.

I'm Eddie.

If you want to wait till his session
is through, then we can talk.

No, I have to get
to work anyway.

If I still have a job.

Sorry.

I didn't know if you want
me to come in today or not.

I would have called but
my phone's broken.

I can explain. It's
not what you think.

Just, please leave.

I love her. You know, I
screwed up but I do love her.

Who?

Who?

I don't know who
you're talking about.

Are you talking about my daughter or are
you talking about this other woman?

Well, Amy, I love Amy.

There's that look again.

What look?

I should've seen it.

When I asked you if she was
the girl of your dreams...

Maybe it is time to retire.

-Look, I-I haven't--
-Just...

I need you to leave.

Thank you.

What?

That's it, just... thank you...
for everything.

Oh, hi.

Hey.

Thank you.

Will you sign right there?

Yeah.

Sorry about last
time, by the way.

Yeah.

I know what's in
these this time.

Good.

Dream suppressors?

No, actually, now I
want the dreams.

This is like some kind of sleeping
pill on steroids kind of thing,

like supposed to bring
on lucid dreaming.

That girl from before is
like blocking me out now,

so I'm trying to reconnect
with her in the dreams.

I really hope it works.

Sorry I asked.

Come on, sign it.

Great.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Can you see me?

Hello? Can you see me?

I'm sure she's around
here somewhere, man.

Yeah, I know. I'll keep looking.

You don't even seem excited.
We're shooting hoops.

No, I... I am. Sorry.

You need to get a grip on reality
and ease up on the sleeping pills.

You know they're naming these
courts after me, right?

What, Nadia's courts?

Do I look like a Nadia?

Hey, Amy, it's me.

I miss you.

I don't know if you get my voicemails
but I just wanted to say hi,

and I hope you and your
dad are doing well.

Uh, give me a call sometime.

Nadia, number 217.

Hi, I had dreams about
a girl, might be you.

And I know this sounds crazy.

If you are the right girl,
you will know who I am.

Nadia 218.

She's there, and then
she just disappears.

This is when you're
asleep though, right?

Yes, yes, as in my
dreams, I just--

I get a glimpse of
her, and she's gone.

Mm-hmm. You can't call her?

No, I don't have her number.

Amy destroyed my phone

and then by the time I looked at the
bill with Nadia's number on it,

she changed it or
disconnected it or something.

Can't do a web search
for her, you know,

go along look her up,
Nadia in Sacramento?

How many could there be?

2,500.

Right.

You know, you look
really tired for a dude

who's been dreaming for
the last few weeks.

Well, I haven't been
sleeping that much.

I was doing the sleeping pill
thing, then trying to wean myself.

Got insomnia most of the
time, it's a blast.

Ugh. I had insomnia once. I'd
watch cartoons to fall asleep.

You say you only met her

one time in real life, right?

Yeah.

How do you know that
wasn't also a dream?

So you're saying I just
made her up, completely.

I'm not saying it, but
it's like, you know,

if that is going to help you move
forward, then I'm saying it.

Okay, you know the texts from her
broke up my relationship with Amy.

You're saying I bought a phone
and a plan and I texted myself.

Well, let's hope not.

Could you stop it? You
do this all time.

I'm trying to help my
friend here, okay?

If he can get past
what's-her-face,

he could get back
together with Amy, maybe.

Maybe she's dead.

Amanda--

No, seriously, wait. Her
number's changed or gone.

She's not appearing in
his dreams anymore,

maybe it's because she
doesn't have a choice.

Maybe you're chasing a
ghost now or something.

If she were alive, she'd
let you find her.

She's dead.

I'm sorry, that's awful.
She's alive.

Let's make cookies.

Have you had her
chocolate chips?

So what is it you plan on doing?

Wandering the streets
of Sacramento,

asking people if
they know a Nadia?

What if she's like me?

What if everybody
thinks she's crazy

and she's only blocking me out 'cause
she thinks I'm getting married?

Okay, Ben, look,

I think Nadia is not what
we want to be focused on.

Okay, I don't need a
session now, mom.

Okay, I'm not, I'm not,

but we need to concentrate on who
is with us now, who is real.

Amy is real.

Amy left me.

Because you--

Sit down.

You were scared to get
married, that's not uncommon.

Commitment can be really scary but you
have come up with a dream scenario

that Amy cannot
possibly live up to.

You need to tell her the truth.

What is the truth?

Well, first you could
try telling yourself

that you never met Nadia.

I did meet Nadia.

Try saying it out loud.

I'm not-- I don't-- No, I
don't want to do that.

Ben, you know yourself, very well,
that when people vocalize something,

it can validate their feelings.

Just try it.

Fine. I never met Nadia.

And that it was all in your head
and you created it out of fear.

This was all in my head. I

created it out of fear.

How does that make you
feel when you say it?

I miss dad.

What do you think
he would tell you?

You know, I made a
promise to him...

couple years after he was gone.

What was it?

You don't have to tell me.

And you don't have
to listen to me.

But, you went into the
army because of your dad

and you became a therapist, I
think, in part because of me.

What you need to
ask yourself is,

what does Ben want?

What do you want?

Hello?

Amy?

Hey.

Hey, what's up?

What are you doing?

Uh...

just...

Do you... Do you want to get
breakfast or something tomorrow?

Breakfast? Um...

I don't know. I'm sorry I
haven't called you back.

My dad said I should've let you
explain the whole dream thing.

Even though it sounded
completely bogus

and something that a
cheater would say,

I'd like to see you.

Let's just talk.

Yeah, yeah. Let's do that.

Where do you think you're going?

Got to meet Amy for
breakfast, I'm 3 hours late.

Well, your car's broke.

Hey, asshole, now let
me get this straight.

When you were trying to stop
dreaming about Nadia, you couldn't.

She decides not to see you again
and boom, she pulls it off.

Yeah, basically.

Well, girls love to
sleep, she's good at it.

Better than you obviously.

Go to Sacramento, find
her in real life.

She has a boyfriend, she
blocked me out for a reason.

She doesn't want to
be a home wrecker.

Right.

Not that there's much
of a home to wreck.

Amy dumped you, brutally.

Yes, thank you.

So what, now you're the closest
thing I can get to Nadia?

The guy I almost
hit in the park?

You're losing in real life and you
can't even dream that your car works.

How about dreaming that
you win for a change?

I'm trying.

You can dream that you're shooting hoops
with a professional basketball player.

So dream that you find
her, that she sees you.

That's what I'm trying to do.

Try harder. What are you
sitting there with me for?

I don't know!

You probably feel bad for
almost killing us on your bike.

She's probably
dreaming right now.

Where is she? What does she see?

I mean, focus.

I don't know.

Where is Nadia?

What is she looking at?

Where is she?

She's...

dreaming about when she
was on the phone with me.

I gave you my number
in a dream and, uh...

and you called me.

But your boyfriend was there?

Yeah.

So where are you? Can we
like meet up or something?

Well, I just moved to
Sacramento, remember?

Oh, right. I was hoping
that part was just me.

Uh,

I have to go.

Well, I'd just like to see you.

But I guess we will.

I guess so.

Wow. Um, well...

Bye.

You're dreaming this
right now, aren't you?

She's remembering.

Quit looking at me.

Stop looking at me and him.

It's 10 o'clock.

What, is this thing broken?

I was calling you, you
weren't answering.

What happened to breakfast?

Took too many sleeping pills.

What, are you trying
to kill yourself?

It's kind of weird
being back here.

It's like going back to an old
school you had or job or something.

You know, I found that
medication you bought,

the dream suppression stuff?

So were you really having
weird dreams or something?

I'm sorry.

Well, that's good.

Considering forgiving you.

No.

You--

I'm sorry that

that you moved back here for me.

I'm sorry. It took me six
years to tell you this

but I'm not the
right guy for you.

I wish I was.

Really?

Could have fooled me since you've
been calling me all the time.

I know.

"Amy, I miss you.
I want to talk.

Why won't you just please
answer your phone?"

I'm sorry, look, I--

And now I finally wanna
talk and you're over it?

Okay, great. Let's be over it!

She broke your phone again?

How many times is that already?

I'm going to Sacramento,
I'm finding Nadia.

You're going all the way
to Sacramento, really?

How are you even
gonna find her, man?

Are you just gonna bang on
people's doors all day,

until she happens to answer?

I don't know, man.

Come on.

But I've been thinking about it.
I'm trying to figure out,

like, is Amy in my head,
is Nadia in my head?

Which one is in my head and my heart
and like which one to follow.

Maybe Nadia is both.

Or maybe it's Amy versus
my head and my heart,

but

if this connection that I have
with Nadia is one in a million,

then I got to follow it, right?

I got to go there, I got
to follow my heart.

It's how it works.

But what if we're
not a statistic?

What if this is the first time
this has ever happened to anybody?

You know they put wheels on
that thing for a reason, right?

Rolls along right behind you.

But I know with my head that it's
completely irrational to go up there

'cause she has a boyfriend
and she blocked me out.

Good, my car is still here.

They were threatening
to repossess it.

But, it doesn't matter if Nadia
is my head or my heart--

Ben, stop.

Just wait a second, dude.

You don't know where
this girl lives!

She's got a boyfriend,

she said she can't
see you anymore,

and you're so sure
about this chick,

you're gonna drive
seven hours to maybe

find the girl of your
dreams, literally.

And you were about to get into
that car without giving me a hug?

Sorry.

If this boyfriend of hers has
half the connection with her

that you've got,
you'll still win.

Thanks, man.

I love you, buddy.

Love you, too.

Oh, that's not good.

Come on!

That's a shame.

Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

I'll figure it out, man.
I'll ride, I'll hitchhike.

Come on, I can fix
this in 3 hours.

You're not a mechanic.

Well, at least wear a helmet.

Thanks again, I appreciate this.

Hey, no problem. You know,
hey, true love, right?

-Sure.
-Yeah.

Where should I drop you? I'll
take you right to her door.

Uh, I actually have no idea.

No idea?

No.

I'll find her.

I'm gonna feel it out.

You're just gonna feel it out?

Now, w-wait a minute, let
me get this straight, now.

You only met this
girl once in person,

but you-you keep
connecting in dreams

and talking to each other and she
gave you her cell phone number

and you called the number from the dream
and it worked and it was her, right?

Yeah.

H-how are you
supposed to find her?

Where do you want
me to take you?

I-I don't know how
I'm gonna find her.

You come to Sacramento on
a whim from Los Angeles

and you don't know where she lives
or where she works or anything?

Are you buying this?

I don't buy it.

I don't think I buy it either.

What's going on?

You got me all upset
now, just get out.

Get out.

What? I-I don't
feel like this is--

I don't feel like this
is the right spot.

Well, I feel like this is the right spot.
Am I speaking English?

Yes.

Well, then get out.

All right.

Thanks.

All right, Nadia, where are you?

Come on. Excuse me?
Do you know a Nadia?

Have you met a--

Come on.

Excuse me, do you know a Nadia?

Have you ever met-- Do you--

Excuse me, have you-- Do
you guys know a Nadia?

-No, no, no.
-No, sorry.

Are you guys from around here?

Listen, don't touch her.

Ow, hey, whoa, I'm just
asking a question.

I don't care.

-Sorry.
-Walk away.

You might have a friend named--

Hey, I said don't touch her.

Stop it, stop, stop!

Come on.

Hey, how's it going?

You don't know if there's a motel
or anything around here, do you?

Sure, actually, you go out this
way, take a right, two blocks,

there's a boots inn.
You can't miss it.

Okay. Two blocks, all right.
Well, thank you.

-You have good night, buddy.
-You too.

Great,

I lost my wallet.

So what's next? You need 10 bucks
just to get through the night?

Try somebody else, pal.

No, man. That's not--

that's not what I'm
doing, I actu--

I just had a really long day.

You lost your wallet,

like that's your
opening gambit, man?

Like that's how you
start this con, right?

You go, oh, I lost my
wallet, take pity on me.

I drove up from LA, actually had
to hitchhike some of the way,

just trying to meet
a girl, actually.

Did I leave my "I give a shit" bumper
sticker on the van? Because I don't.

Is this your van?

Yes.

Would it be possible for me to
maybe sleep in your van for,

I don't know 20 minutes
or something, is that--

Oh, just 20 minutes
to nap in my van?

No, you can't nap in
my van, that's weird.

That's really crazy.
You're crazy.

No, man, I'm not, I'm not crazy.

Back it up, back it up.

Okay, okay.

I have pepper spray.

Bye. Never mind.

Pervert.

A little bright, but comfortable like this.
Comfortableâ€¦

We came all the way
up to Sacramento

and this is what
you're dreaming about?

Uh, I'm trying.

-Hey, focus. Focus, focus, focus.
-Focus. All right.

Focus on Nadia.

Stop talking.

507 Oakwood. Okay, remember.

Oh.

You okay?

Did you have a bad dream?

I don't know.

Well, you know, I'm pretty good at making
people forget about their bad dreams.

What number was it?

A little after 1:00, 1:30.

No, no, no. What's the address?

Address? What address? What
are you talking about?

I need-- I need to write
something, I need--

Give me a pen, give me a pen.

Your bike sucks.

And he sounds like--

Hey, what's up, man?
Oh, give me this.

407, 407.

Yeah, that's me.
Yeah, that's me.

This is that stuff I was talking about.
You're gonna love this.

407...

She giving you trouble?

Excuse me?

See? This is what
I'm talking about.

You can't take notes
on your hand, Ben.

No, no, I wasn't taking notes.

Hello? Are you mental?

Uh, sorry.

Told me not to call my mom.
Said she was a loser.

What? Hey, I didn't say that.

You called his mom a loser?

No, I didn't say that.

What is he, 26, 27? You're gonna
let him take over your practice?

I know, he can barely move a
mattress without needing a break.

He smells like onions.

He does smell like onions.

Gross.

Oh, Oakwood! It was 54--

What?

-What?
-What are you talking about?

Right, Oakwood! 542 Oakwood!

Oh, I'm sorry. This
session is just--

-Disaster.
-Disaster.

750, 750.

We're playing 101, 2s and 3s,
to 21, you're losing. 17-0.

Yeah. No, stop, it's an address.
It's in Oaktree.

It's not an Oaktree,
it's Hemlock!

Ben, you're late. Have
a seat on the slide.

No, uh-- no. I want to find...

Look, there's no oak here.

Is he on medication?

I think he is, found
some weird pills.

Rose, 5-- 507, no.

Ben, do you want help me out? I'm
trying to run a session here.

No, I don't want to be a shrink.
Will you just call your mom already?

That was rude.

You're having trouble?

4--7--

Having problems?

Honey, have you met Harry?

No, but I'd like to.

This is your daughter?

-Hi.
-Hi.

Wow. How tall are you?

6'3", 195.

It's true.

Will you guys stop
saying numbers, please?

Got a 1,600 on my SAT.

Really?

Harry runs a hedge fund.

Ben, you're gonna miss the bus.

You can't sleep here.

Hey, that's my bike.

This bike? You know
this bike sucks.

Ben, you can't sleep out here.

You can't sleep here.

You can't sleep out here, Ben.

You can't sleep here, Ben.

You can't sleep here!

507, Woodoak. That's
it, that's it.

507, okay, remember,
remember, Ben.

You can't sleep here.

You can't sleep here.
You can't sleep here.

You can't sleep here.
You can't sleep here.

Sorry.

For 57 years I've been
sleeping here, remember that.

Fifty-seven years I've
been sleeping here.

Fifty-seven.

Watch it.

Hi. I found you.

Um, sorry, this--

okay, it's late. I
want to say something.

On my last day in the army...

I tried to give my
sergeant all my stuff,

my gear, my uniforms,
everything,

and I tried to give him
my dog tags and he said,

these aren't for me.

These are for the love
of my life someday.

And I said, how will I know?

And he said, when you don't
have to think about it.

With Amy, I almost
gave them to her

but I had to think about it
and that was the problem.

But with you, I know you
must be the love of my life

'cause

I don't have to think about it.

Who are you?

You're just a guy that
I met in the park.

This is only the second time I've
seen you when I've been awake.

And it's the second time
I've seen you and, look,

you don't have to see me

ever again here or

anywhere, but

I made a promise
to my sergeant...

and to my father. So

I have to give these to you.

I didn't say I wasn't
gonna take them.

I'm single now, by the way, I
don't know if you're still--

if you have your
boyfriend, if he's...

How could I?

Do you snore?

Yup.

Do you flail around?

Yup, got the jimmy legs.

Jimmy legs? Uh-oh.

What about you?

Well, yeah, I got
the jimmy legs.

Jimmy arms,

I even got a guy named Jimmy
that wakes me up every 3 hours,

busts into the room. Is
that gonna be a problem?

No, no, no problem.

Okay.

I'm also unemployed now.

I quit my job today.

Today?

Yeah.

My plan was for you
to support me.

-We're screwed.
-We're screwed.

Tell me something I
don't know about you.

You know everything about me.

Prove it.
