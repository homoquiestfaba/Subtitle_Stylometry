Claire.

Help!

Anybody!

Tonight's top story,
the notorious serial killer,...

...Edward Wojowski's gruesome
reign of terror over the city...

...of Pittsburgh came to an end
today with the escape...

...of one of his would-be victims
from an abandoned steel mill.

Unconfirmed police reports
indicate that the killer,...

...popularly referred to
as The Survivalist,...

...was killed by an unidentified
female when she escaped,...

...despite severe injuries,
to South Side Hospital.

How are you feeling?

Okay.

Well, I've looked at your
x-rays and the CT scan.

There is some ligament
damage to your knee.

It's gonna require therapy
and a bit of time...

...to completely mend.

Your eye on the other hand,
well, there's been some damage.

Best thing we can do is
leave this bandage on...

...for the next week,
let nature run its course.

I'm afraid you're not gonna
get all of your vision back,...

...but there will be some improvement.

Thanks.

My most pressing concern right now,...

...is for your state
of mental well-being.

A traumatic event like this,...

...it's gonna be difficult
for you to get over.

This is the number of a friend of mine.

He can help you get through this.

Give him a call.

He's a good guy.

But like your eye, it's
gonna take some time.

No, no, no, no.

No!

No, no, no.

No, no, no, no.

No, no no no no, no, no no no no.

No.

This is, uh--

Monday, May 5th.

This is the interview
with Penelope Warren,...

...by detective Jake Mosser,...

...relating to the events
of April 29th to May 2nd.

Can I get you a water, coffee,...

...something like that, Miss Warren?

No, no I'm fine, thank you.

I'll try to make this as
brief as possible, Penelope.

Um, well, Penny.

You can just call me Penny,
I mean, everyone does.

Well--

Everyone did.

Okay then.

Penny, uh--

I'd like you to take a look
at this photo, if you will.

Can you tell me, uh, who that is?

Um--

Yeah, that's him, that's the--

That's the man that murdered,...

...and killed all my friends,...

...and that killed my fiance.

The man I killed with an ax.

Let the record show that
Miss Warren has identified...

...Edward Wojowski, also
known as The Survivalist,...

...as her assailant.

Well, uh--

I think that's all we're gonna
need from you, uh, today.

There'll be a hearing regarding
the murder of Wojowski.

I don't expect that
you'll be needed for that.

Uh--

Given the circumstances,...

...I don't believe that
anyone would think that you...

...acted, uh, in any way other
than your own self-defense.

So I hope that now you can...

...start to get past this and,
uh, move on with your life.

How?

I beg your pardon?

How exactly am I supposed
to move on with my life?

All my friends are dead.

My fiance is dead.

They were butchered by that--

That maniac.

Penny, uh, I look at you and,...

...I can see it.

You're a survivor.

Apparently so.

No, no.

No!

No, no, no.

No, no, no, no, no.

No no, no no no no.

No.

Tell me what you see, Penny.

He's--

He's tall.

And he's angry.

It's hard, I can't--

I--

There's so much blood
in my eyes, I can't see.

He has a knife.

I--

I think he knows where I am.

What, what are you doing?

Nothing.

I, I'm too scared to move.

It's, it's so cold.

I'm so hungry and my eye,...

...my eye hurts so bad.

You're vulnerable right now.

Okay, let's talk.

The effects of an experience
like this continues to...

...undermine your own confidence, Penny.

The violation you sustained
at the hands of Mr. Wojowski,...

...well, this is something that
we'll surely be dealing with...

...for quite some time.

But in the end, we'll be
able to overcome it together.

All right?

Whatever you say.

Okay, good.

Now will I be able to
see you again, Friday?

Okay.

Thanks, doctor.

Okay.

No!

No!

Are we having more nightmares?

Oh, yeah.

You know--

I thought they'd be
getting better by now.

Well, these things take time.

I'll give you a prescription,
something to help you sleep.

Yeah, thanks.

I mean, I think the hardest
thing that you're facing...

...right now is how to
reinsert yourself...

...into your old life, Penny.

My old life is gone, Dr. Lentz.

I mean, there must be something, surely.

Have you tried
going back to work, uh,...

...what is it exactly
that you do again?

Um--

â™ª Our darlin' she's turned
into a savage â™ª

â™ª She's a warrior â™ª

â™ª There's no stopping her â™ª

â™ª She's a warrior â™ª

â™ª There's no stopping her â™ª

I was an entertainer.

An entertainer.

Well maybe that's
the medicine that we need.

We're told today, the remains
of Edward Wojowski...

...were laid to rest in
an unmarked grave.

Potters Field will be
the final resting place...

...of the man who terrorized
the one and a half million...

...residents of the
greater Pittsburgh area.

But the question on the minds
of the relieved people...

...of this city is, who is
this woman who stopped...

...the bloody trail of death
and suffering...

...that The Survivalist blazed?

Sources say the woman
is in her mid-20s,...

...a local model and dancer.

Little more is known about this
woman some Pittsburghers...

...are calling a hero, but
rest assured, WPXX...

...will continue searching for answers.

This is Alicia Hayes reporting.

â™ª High-class trash,
white, black, talks back â™ª

â™ª React, kick ass, likes a
beer in a champagne glass â™ª

â™ª Melodramatic, fucked up and again â™ª

So tell me what you see.

I--

I can see the light.

I can see it a little.

But--

Okay.

I'm sorry, Penny,...

...there was just too much damage
to the cornea and your iris.

So then, that's it?

Well, look at this way,...

...you still have excellent
vision in your other eye.

It's important to look at positive
things at a time like this.

Yeah.

Positive.

Like, we can get rid of that crutch
and give you a knee brace.

Great!

Thank you.

So how's it going with Dr. Lentz?

Well, you know.

It's going.

Penny Warren?

Yeah?

Hi, I'm Alicia Hayes, WPXX News?

I'm not interested
in giving any interviews.

Look, I was just wondering if we could--

No, no, no, I'm not.

No, no interviews, just watch your hand.

I'm just gonna leave my card
here for you, Penny!

Just in case you want
someone to talk to!

Lady, I have enough people...

...that I have to talk to as it is.

I can't drive.

I can't work.

I can't, I can't even make a sandwich.

Fuck.

I don't have enough money
to pay for physical therapy...

...for my leg.

I don't even have enough
money to pay you, doctor.

Edward Wojowski squatted
in the steel mill,...

...and you know, he had no family.

It's not like I can sue his
estate or anything, can I?

There's just, everything
is just now, it's just me.

I'm just, alone.

You're angry.

Well I'm glad all that money
towards your college degree...

...didn't go wasted, doc, 'cause
you're fuckin' right I'm angry.

That bastard took everything from me!

He took everything!

He took my vision, he took my leg.

He took the--

He took the only man that I ever loved!

God.

And you know what,
doctor, you know what?

Why, why did he leave me?

Why didn't he kill me?

'Cause this life wasn't meant for me.

I wasn't supposed to deal with
all this shit 'cause my life...

...wasn't this shit.

Fuck.

You should feel free to let it out.

This is a safe place.

Safe? Yeah, hm.

I thought my house was
a safe place, doctor.

I thought the woods was a safe place.

You know what?

Safety, there is no such thing
as a safe place, I mean,...

...safety is just,
it's just an illusion.

What I'm gonna do is prescribe
you something a little bit...

...more powerful,
a more powerful dosage.

You need time, you need
time to heal yourself,...

...to heal your psyche.

Yeah.

Thanks.

Shit!

Hello, Penny.

Oh god, lady, do you not get the hint?

Well if I did, then I wouldn't be very
good at my job now, would I?

Hey, I just wanted--

Jesus.

Don't fuckin' touch me.

Now you listen to me and you listen
to me real fuckin' good,...

...news lady, now is the time
for you to start backing off.

Okay?

But people wanna know!

What?

What do they exactly wanna know?

Do they wanna know how it feels
to have everybody that you...

...care about butchered?

Or maybe they wanna know how
it feels to have to go through...

...the rest of your life
looking like a fuckin' freak.

I planted an ax in a guy's skull, bitch.

So maybe that should be
a hint to you,...

...to leave me the fuck alone.

I planted an ax in a guy's skull, bitch.

No, no no, no no.

So what do we got?

Look familiar?

Did you check her back?

Um, not yet, I wanted you
to see her before I moved her.

No scrapes on the back
of her ankles or her legs...

...that I can see here.

What do you think?

Did you check to see if there's
any defensive wounds...

...on the arms or hands?

Nothin' even under her nails.

I know, I can't figure it out.

She let somebody do this?

It's happened the same way.

I mean, look at the body positioning.

Everything is the same as the last time.

And my question is, if
that's not Wojowski,...

...then who the hell are
we dealing with here?

Coming.

Oh, Detective--

Mosser.

Mosser, sorry.

Um.

Come in, come in.

Thanks.

Um.

I was just, um--

Oh, do you want some
coffee or something?

Sure, that'd be great, thanks.

Just give me a second.

This is a nice place.

So uh, how are you doing, Penny?

The truth?

Of course.

Pretty fuckin' bad.

Well I'm sorry.

It's a hell of a thing.

You took a man's life, right
or wrong, it changes you.

It changes you.

My first year as a detective.

Domestic disturbance.

You know, more police officers
are injured on domestics...

...than any other type of call?

No, I didn't know that.

What happened?

Well--

That's not important anymore.

People were in danger,
I had a choice to make...

...and I made it, simple as that.

I'd do it again if I had to.

Well, I think I'd do it again.

So, um--

Oh, I'm sorry, did you come--

Did you need anything from me?

I didn't know if I forgot
to call you or, did you--

Penny, we found a girl's body,...

...up in the woods
on the hill this morning.

By the reservoir.

We haven't, uh, IDed the girl yet,...

...but she was stripped naked
and killed with a survival knife.

Just, um--

Just like--

Yeah, the trouble is, what's
left of Edward Wojowski is...

...in an urn in the Potters Field.

I know, I saw him cremated.

So what are you saying then?

We're just not sure.

There's been a lot of media
coverage of these events.

Sometimes we get copycats.

People looking to grab a headline.

The other possibility
is that Edward Wojowski...

...was not working alone.

That he had some kind of
a partner on the outside.

We just don't know.

Well there's--

There's, um--

I'm sorry, detective, I'm--

I'm not, I'm not feeling that well.

Penny.

Penny, are you all right?

Yeah.

I'm fine, detective, I'm
just not feeling that good.

Can I call someone for you?

There's no one left to call.

I'm sorry?

Um.

Nothing, can you just
make sure that the door...

...is locked on your way out?

I'll--

Can I call and check on your tomorrow?

I feel bad leaving you like this.

Okay, um, great, thanks.

Yeah, I'll talk to your tomorrow.

I'll--

You, uh, you take care.

Shit.

The city of Pittsburgh is
breathing a sigh of relief...

...this week knowing that one of
its most dangerous denizens,...

...Edward "The Survivalist"
Wojowski, is dead.

This is the steel mill where
Wojowski ate, slept...

...and tortured his victims.

Now police are not letting any
reporters into the building,...

...but here at WPXX, we've
gained exclusive information...

...regarding the woman who
some are referring to as...

...the one who got away.

This is the home of Penny Warren,...

...who would have been
The Survivalist's ninth victim,...

...before her daring escape
last Tuesday...

...during which she managed
to kill her captor with an ax.

I attempted to interview
Miss Warren the other day,...

...but found her unwilling to
talk about the recent events.

Evidently, this is a woman
who is still dealing...

...with the trauma from recent events.

And now, we have unconfirmed
reports that another body...

...has been found in
the woods in Mount Oliver.

It's obvious that this is
a story whose conclusion...

...has yet to be decided.

Until then, we'll be working
to keep you informed.

Alicia Hayes, WPXX News.

You know, I really hate to see you
withdrawn like this, Penny.

I don't know, doctor, I've been--

I think after all I've been
through and, you know,...

...all the killings and stuff,
like, maybe,...

...maybe it changed me, somehow.

Well, you are who you are
and nothing can change that.

I don't know, I've been
having these dreams,...

...like, these awful dreams.

And my temper, I'm just so angry.

Well, well of course you're angry.

I mean, your life has been
turned upside down,...

...and as far as the rest,
your body's adjusting...

...to the medication and you know,
these things take time...

...and we will work them out.

You know, the world has a lot
to offer, and I'm afraid that...

...you're missing out on some
of these things, and uh,...

...despite what you think, you're
a young and attractive woman...

...and uh, I'm sure that there's
something out there for you.

Penny?

Penny?

Hello?

Penny, it's Dr. Lentz.

Uh, you missed your appointment
this morning,...

...and I was wondering if
uh, everything was okay.

I'm a little concerned.

No, doctor.

Everything is most definitely,...

...not all right.

Well, if you feel better about coming
over here to see me,...

...or I can come to see you--

I...

I think it's best if you just--

If you just stay away from me.

Well Penny, I could be there, like,
in around 10 minutes if you want--

Goodbye, doctor.

Penny, you didn't answer
my call last night.

How'd you know I was here, detective?

Please, call me Jake.

Okay.

How'd you know I was here, Jake?

Now, I don't want you to take
this the wrong way.

Oh god, please don't tell me
that you're following me.

Penny, I just wanted to be sure
that you're okay.

After what I've been through?

You don't think I have enough
reasons to be paranoid?

I just--

I did it because I was
worried about you.

Whoever killed these girls--

I gotta go.

Penny, wait.

No, no.

Fuckin' get away from me!

Let go of me!

Why me, Jake?

Let me give you a ride home.
No, no!

You answer me.

There is a maniac out
there killing girls,...

...and you're stalking me?

Look at me, I'm
a mangled ex-stripper,...

...with a gimp leg, I can't work.

I gotta ride god-damn public
transportation on top of...

...all of that, I got some major...

...anger issues.

As you, might be able to tell.

So, uh--

Is that a yes?

I know that reporter lady's
been harassing you.

I'll see what I can do
to get her to quit.

Good luck.

She's almost as tenacious as you.

You know, it seems like everybody
is trying to help me, but--

The more they try--

I don't know.

I don't want anything from you, Penny.

I don't have an angle, really.

I just--

Just, just--

Want you to be okay.

There's something that you should see.

What?

This is it.

What's it?

Where they buried his ashes.

It's over now, Penny.

Now you can...
Move on with your life.

I found out the victim's name.

Megan Shamonski.

Turns it she works at The Cricket.

Danced under the name Sunny St. Claire.

Stripper.

Well, it fits The Survivalist's profile.

Yeah, more than you know.

Guess who else worked at The Cricket.

Guess who knew Sunny.

Oh, shit.

Jake.

This Warren girl.

She's caught up in something
that's far from being over...

...and the fact that you're seeing her--

I'm just...
I'm looking out for her, Kim.

She's been through hell.

Everybody she knows is dead, she's--

She's all alone out there.

You understand that, right?

No.

I don't.

And what if she's
more involved in this...

...than either of us know?

What then?

I mean, god, she could be
so messed up in the head...

...she doesn't even know
what she's doing anymore.

And what if she's acting out,...

...everything that happened to her?

Well then, uh--

I guess I'd--

Be the first to know.

Won't I?

Oh hey, how are you doing?

It was nice of your mom...

...to let you borrow her car.

Come on, I get 400 miles
to the gallon in this thing.

I told you, I can't handle tequila.

Fuck.

I'm sorry.

I can't.

It's--

It's all right.

Fuck you, it's all right!

I'm sorry.

Stay away from me, Jake.

Stay away from me
or we'll both be sorry.

I mean it.

Go!

Obvious that Penny Warren
knows more about this...

...than has been revealed.

This reporter wonders why
the police are just allowing...

...a material witness to withhold
such potentially valuable...

...information.

Lieutenant Jake Mosser, the
detective in charge of the...

...ongoing investigation even
contacted me earlier this week...

...and pressured me to abandon
WPXX's reporting on the subject.

More young people are dying, detective.

Instead of covering it up, you
need to bring in this woman...

...and do whatever it takes
to find out what she knows...

...about this new murder.

Penny?

Did you watch the news
tonight, Dr. Lentz?

Yes, I saw it but uh, you really
shouldn't take much stock...

...in what a TV reporter has to say.

You know they're just after--

No, um, I wanna know,...

...do you think there's
a part of me that died...

...along with my friends?

The good part of me.

Penny, you have to realize
that there's a lot of guilt...

...that's associated with when
someone survives an incident...

...where others die.

You know that, don't you?

Bullshit!

Bullshit.

I don't want any of your psychological
PhD opinion crap, okay?

I wanna, I wanna know...

...if someone kills another person,...

...if something inside
of them breaks,...

...that allows them to go and kill...

...someone else again and again.

Penny, are you taking your medication?

Penny?

Penny?

Never mind.

Sorry I called you so late.

Penny?

Penny!

No, Steven, I think it's
a perfectly worthwhile...

...allocation of my time, actually.

Well I think it's a good idea because...

...no one else is going after her,...

...and if I can land this, I can
scoop Channel 4 and WPPG.

Well tell Lou and the others
that they're fucking pussies...

...and they need to strap it on...

...if they wanna play
with the big kids, okay?

Okay.

Well I'm gonna go take a shower.

Yes, Steven, I'll be naked.

That's how people take showers, naked.

Freak.

You?

Penny!

Penny, I know you're there.

Will you just answer on the phone?

Penny, something's happened,
we need to talk.

Penny, Alicia Hayes was
killed last night.

They're gonna make me bring you in...

...if you don't talk to
Detective Hatherton.

Where's Detective Mosser?

Oh, he's not doing this
interview, Miss Warren, I am.

God, okay.

You know what? I really
don't need to see that, I get it.

Look, Penny, you've been
through a hell of an ordeal.

I get it, I do.

But there are people dying out
there and they're people...

...that you have crossed paths
with and you have no alibi...

...for either night.

So what I need from you,...

...is a reason why I shouldn't
think you're completely crazy,...

...and that you're not
responsible for all of this.

Jesus.

All right, well.

So, am I under arrest?

Not technically, no, but you
are a person of interest...

...in an ongoing investigation.

Okay then, well.

I'm out of here.

Hatherton.

You gotta suck it up, sister,...

...or you'll never make it
through all this shit.

Who's there?

I think you know.

Oh, god.

Just get out.

Leave me alone!

I think you know that's impossible.

I can't leave, because
I'm a part of you.

No.

No, no, no you're not me.

You're--

You're not me, you're a lie!

No, Penny.

I'm the only real truth.

Open your eyes and you'll see,...

...I'm the part of you
that you can't face.

I'm the one that got you
through all this blood...

...and all the shit,
and all the death.

Take my hand.

Why?

Why are you here?

I told you.

I'm here to free you.

Free me to do what?

To fulfill your destiny.

There's work to be done
and I can't do it alone.

You've been suffering for weeks.

You must be exhausted.

Don't worry.

I know how to make the pain go away.

Yeah.

So do I.

Hello, Dr. Lentz.

Jesus Christ!

Penny, you scared me!

What are you doing here?

You left your door unlocked.

That's a very dangerous
thing to do, I mean,...

...anybody could have
came walkin' in here.

Well, at least I'm glad it's you,...

...but what are you doing here?

I don't understand. Did we have
an appointment or something?

I don't, I don't get this.

You see, I have come to a point of,...

...self-realization.

Penny, you need help.

That's right.

Everybody wants to help me.

Penny, this is not, this is not good.

Here.

Penny, you can't quit
these cold turkey,...

...they're too strong!

Without, you know, side-effects?

Headaches and nausea,...

...and irritability and anxiety,
oh I know.

Trust me, I know.
Penny, Penny, please.

Please.

I decided I needed my own life back.

I decided I needed to tell
what was real and what wasn't.

Penny, I don't understand.

I can't believe it took me
this long to figure.. out!

You and your fuckin' drugs!

You killed that reporter!

She had a big mouth.

She was putting everything
together anyways.

She was gonna figure things out.

Yeah.

And what did Sunny do to you?

Why did you kill her?

Why did you kill any of them?
Stop it.

I had to do it, I had to kill them.

They were putting things together
like that bitch detective.

She had to learn how to mind
her own fucking business.

Please stop hitting me.

Why me? Why me?

Tell me, why me?

After everything I've
been through, why me!

Stop it.

Please.

Give me some god-damn answers...
And maybe I'll think about it!

I will, will, just please, please
stop fucking hurting me.

I was Wojowski's doctor.

He came to me four years ago.

I tried to keep him off the books.

He was perfect for what
I was trying to do.

He was like clay in my hands.

He had been abused his
entire childhood, and--

I had always wondered
what all that anger...

...would be like in that powerful
huge individual like him.

Would there be an outlet for it.

And you gave it to him.

You gave him my friends.

And me.

I needed to know.

Medicine needed to know.

What makes someone kill.

Is it a switch that you pull off and on?

Is it--

Is it something that can be
controlled and I needed to know!

What made you kill, Penny?

What made someone like you
take another man's life?

I killed Wojowski because I had to!

But you?

I'm gonna kill you because I want to.

Killing me...
Only proves that I was right.

Fine.

You were right.

They're gonna be coming
for me soon,...

...because of what you did,...

...you and that monster
that you created.

Whatever.

I guess we're gonna see
how this all ends, huh?

Dr. Lentz!

Dr. Lentz, we need to speak
with you, it's very important!

It's about a call you made
to one of our detectives.

Detective Hatherton.

Dr. Lentz!

Doctor--

Is there anybody here?

If there's anybody here,
show yourself right now!

Damnit, Penny.

Kim?

Fuck.

Jake.

What have you done?

Do it.

Go on.

Shoot me.

Blow me straight to hell.

You honestly think I give
a shit anymore?

Why?

Why her?

I didn't kill her.

I found her like that
whenever I got here.

And the doctor?

It was him.

He was your copycat.

It was him right from the beginning.

Just the puppet-master
pulling all the strings.

I checked his cell phone records.

There were dozens of calls
made to a prepaid cell phone...

...purchased by him
with his credit card.

Most of them around the time
that you and your friends--

Yeah, he was training Wojowski,
right from the beginning.

Just pushing him over the edge,
just a little bit to unleash...

...that killer that was inside of him.

He did the same thing to me.

I killed everybody I cared about.

And anybody that got in the way.

Like Sunny and that reporter.

And Kim?

He wanted to see just
how much I could take...

...until I just went right
over the edge.

Well I guess he found out.

I guess he did.

Then why not come to me for help?

Penny, why did you bring
me back here, to this?

This is where it all began for me.

If Lentz was right...
Then whatever it was inside of me,...

...that just woke up whenever
I killed Wojowski--

It's not gonna end,
it's never gonna end.

And--

Those dreams.

The dreams are just getting
more and more vivid,...

...and more and more frequent.

You didn't kill Sunny,
and that reporter.

Penny, I believe that.

Well, maybe I didn't.

But I wanted to.

I could actually see myself doing it.

And if that's the way the rest
of my life is gonna be,...

...then I don't even wanna live.

No.

What Lentz started,...

...is gonna finish...
Right here, and now.

You know, they made so many
of these in the 80s.

I was a little too young to
remember but I checked.

Turns out that you can
buy a bunch of 'em...

...on the internet next to nothing.

I don't know if it was Wojowski
or if it was Lentz...

...that chose it, but,
whoever it was did a good job.

Just all sorts of goodies that
you can just store in here.

Whatever you're
planning on doing, don't.

We can go to the prosecutor about--

About Lentz.

With all that you've been through,...

...I'm sure that we can work
something out.

I'm sorry, Jake.

I really am.

You know this game, right?

You run and I chase.

If Lentz was right, then I kill you.

If not, you get away and
you bring back a posse...

...to come and get me.

Either way,...
This is gonna end today.

Go.

Stay there!

Don't move.

Penny.

This isn't you.

Stop acting like you know me, Jake!

You don't know me, you
don't know the real me!

There's something behind these
eyes that are just screaming!

And it wants to kill everything!

Penny.

It's not--

It's not you, it's, it's
everything that's happened to you.

It's Lentz and all his
bullshit theories.

The real you can choose
who you wanna be.

I know that you know I've--

I've come to care about
you a great deal.

Shut up!

There isn't enough going on
that I gotta worry about...

...some detective having
a schoolboy crush on me.

Come on!

I'm just trying to help you
remember the girl you were...

...before all this happened to you.

No.

No.

No, there's no going back.

Not for me.

Well--

Then I guess--

You're gonna have to kill me then.

I guess so.

And, if you kill me, that means--

Oh, this thing, that's inside you,...

...that means that is
who you really are.

No.

No more mind games, no more nothing.

This all ends.

I'm, I'm sorry, Jake.

Yeah.

Me too.

Damnit.

Fine.

Go ahead.

Just make it quick.

Come on, Penny.

What the fuck are you doing?

I told you.

I just, wanted to help you.

Well you can't, can you?

Mosser!

There is no way on earth
I'm gonna let you...

...interrogate that woman.

Yeah, you and the DA try and stop me.

Chief will have your badge for this.
