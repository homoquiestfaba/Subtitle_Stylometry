There is one all-time greatest
moment in the history of sports,

and it happened
in the 1932 World Series.

The story goes that in the bottom
of the ninth inning with two outs,

a full count
and the tying run on base,

Babe Ruth raised his arm and pointed
to the center field bleachers.

No one believed it,
because nobody had ever done it before.

But The Babe
was calling his shot.

On the next pitch, the Great Bambino
hit a towering 400-foot home run.

And even although he'd been
a hero before that,

that's pretty much
how he became a legend.

Thirty years later, a kid named
Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez...

became a neighborhood legend.

It was in the greatest summer
of my life...

when he taught me
to play baseball,

and he became my best friend.

And he got me out of the biggest
pickle I'd ever be in.

Come over at 9:00.

All right.
See you later.

I moved to the neighborhood
two weeks before school let out.

It was the same summer
that Dodger Maury Wills would
break the stolen bases record.

It was the same summer
that Dodger Maury Wills would
break the stolen bases record.

So with something
that incredible going on,

it should've started off with loads
of great things happening for me,

but it didn't.

I was from another state,
and I didn't have a single
friend in a thousand miles.

It was a lousy way
to end up the fifth grade,

'cause I had zip time
to make friends before summer.

And that's about
where it all started.

My real dad died
when I was just a little kid.

My mom had married Bill about a year
before we moved to the Valley.

At the time, he and I were still
getting used to each other.

[ Knocking ]
Yeah.

Um, Dad?
Mm-hm m?

I -I mean Bill.

Remember you-- you promised
you'd teach me to play catch?
Mm-hmm.

Um,

w-well,
could you teach me?

Yeah. Sure.

Okay.

Okay?
Thanks.

Sorry.

[Man Narrating] I'd followed them
to the sandlot once after school.

I'd never seen any place like it.
[ Boys Shouting ]

It was like their own little
baseball kingdom or something.

It was the greatest place
I'd ever seen anyway.

Bertram.
But they were good,

real good.
Come on, Bertram!

And all I had was a plastic toy mitt
that my grandmother gave me...

for my birthday when I was six.

But when I finally got up enough guts to
go out there and try and make friends,

I found out that they never kept score,
they never chose sides,

they never even really
stopped playing the game.

It just went on forever.
Every day they picked up where
they left off the day before.

It was like an endless dream game.
Come on! Come on!

There was only eight of them,
so they didn't have a whole team.

So even though I didn't know
how to play, I figured
I could be the ninth man...

and maybe just stand in the outfield
somewhere and take up space.

Squints!
Of course, if I'd have known what was
gonna happen when I got there,

I got it!
I probably never would've gone.

Nice catch.
Yeah.

Come on!
[ Rustling ]

[ Dog Barking ]

[ Clattering, Banging ]

[ Growling ]

Come on, Benny,
hit a homer!

Come on!
Hey, batter, batter, batter!

Whoa!
Watch out!

[ Boys Shouting ]

[ Screams ]
[ All Laughing ]

Okay, I'll get it!
Get it.

Don't be a goofus. Don't be a goofus!
Don't be a goofus!

[Rumbling Sound, Dog Growling]

Throw the ball back! Come on!
Yeah, hurry up!


We are waiting!

Come on! Throw it!

[Boys Shouting]

[ Shouting Continues ]

Come on, toss me the ball!
Come on!

Come on!

[ Boys Laughing ]

Oh, my God!
[ Laughing Continues ]

My life's over.

Did you see that hand?

[Boys Chattering, Laughing]

[Man Narrating]
If it wasn't for Benny,

I never would've made
a single friend that summer,

'cause all the rest of those
guys thought I was a lost cause.

Even before we became friends,
[ Mechanical Whirring ]

Benny and me were connected, connected
for the one moment later that summer...

when I'd get us all
into the biggest pickle...

any of us had ever seen.

[ Knocking ]

Night, hon.
[ Grunts ]

Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.
It was an accident.

Scotty, have you made
any friends yet?

No.
Why not, honey?

'Cause I'm still new.

I don't want you sitting around in here
all summer fiddling with this stuff...

like you did last summer
and the one before.

I know you're smart,
and I'm proud of you.

I want you to get out into the fresh air
and make some friends.

Run around,
scrape your knees, get dirty.

Climb trees, hop fences.

Get into trouble,
for crying out loud.

Not too much, but some.
You have my permission.

How many mothers do you know who
say something like that to their sons?

[ Chuckles ]
Well, none mothers, I guess.

Honey, I want you to make
some friends this summer. Lots of them.

Yeah, I know.

But I'm not good
at anything, Mom.

Face it,
I'm just an egghead.

Honey, you'll always be just an egghead
with an attitude like that.

[TV: Indistinct]

[ Whispering ]
Well?

Well?

He's too busy, Mom.
Oh, no, honey, he's not.
He has some time.

You go on back out there
and ask him.

[TV Continues ]

Uh, Bill, uh--
Yeah?

I mean, Dad, uh, can we--

I mean, could you, like you said,
teach me to play catch?

Yeah. Sure.

But I gotta get
this done, okay?

Okay, thanks.
All right.

Bill?
Yeah?

Uh, couldn't you take a break
and teach him now?

Mom, it's okay, really.
Honey,

I said I would, and I will,
but I'm under the gun here.

How long could it take?

Can't you spare half an hour
and show him now?

Mom, really, it's okay.
All right.

Okay. I'll get my glove.

See? I told you.

Oh, great.

All right, Scotty, get down
to that end of the yard.

Okay.

Now, the key to this game
is keeping your eye on the ball.

No matter whether you're in the field
or at bat, eye on the ball, okay?

All right. Uh, yeah.
I think so.

Where the ball goes,
your glove should go. Got it?

Okay.

Okay. All right.

[ Grunts ]

Darn. Sorry.

It's all right.
All right.

Um-- Uh, here.

Okay.

Okay, I'm ready.

Eye on the ball, okay?
Got it?

Okay.

If the ball moves,
move your glove. Got it?

Yeah.

All right. Here we go.

Okay. You just need a bigger glove.
Throw it back to me this time.

Throw it back.

Okay. Scotty,
keep your eye on the ball.

Okay. Got it.

Okay.

Ow! Oh, my eye!

Ow! Ow! Oh!

Ow! Ow!

What happened?
[ Groans ] My eye.

Honey, get some ice. Ice.
No, I got it.

Here you go.
Those were for dinner.

Oh!
-Just hold it up there.

Nice and hard.
Press it against-- Yeah.

I just took my eye off the ball, Mom.
Yeah, but you caught it.

[Groaning]
-Just keep that on for, like, an hour.

It'll still be black,
but it won't swell.

Sorry.

Gotta watch out
for that curve.

[ Crying ]

Hey.

I'm gonna play some ball.
We need an extra guy. You wanna go?

No. Thanks.
Why not? Don't you like baseball?

Oh, yeah, but--
But what?

But my glove--
it's busted.

Uh, see? Now I can't go.
Thanks, though.

It's okay.

I got an extra one.

Come on. Let's go.

Mom, I'm gonna go
play some ball!

I'll be back
in a little while.

Come on. Let's go.

And I'm Babe Ruth.
[Boys Chattering]

Listen. Ready?

Check this out.

[ Muffled ]
I'm the Great Bambino.

[ Boys ]
What?

I'm the Great Bambino.
[ All ] What?

I'm the Great Bambino.

[ All ]
Oh!

Who's that?

What?

[Scotty Narrating] I had no idea
who they were talking about.

What did he say?
What, were you born in a barn, man?

Yeah, what planet
are you from?

[Scotty Narrating] But there was
no way I could let them know.

You never heard
of the Sultan of Swat?

The Titan of Terror?

The Colossus of Clout?
The Colossus of Clout!

The King of Crash, man.
[Scotty Narrating] So I lied.

Oh, yeah, the Great Bambino.
Of course.

I thought you said,
"the Great Bambi."

That wimpy deer?

Yeah. I guess. Sorry.

Anyway, Scott, that's
Timmy and Tommy Timmons,

Mike "Squints" Palledorous,

Alan McClellan--
we call him Yeah-Yeah--

Bertram Grover Weeks,

Kenny DeNunez
and Hamilton Porter.

We call him Ham.
Guys, this is Scott Smalls.

Hi.

Yeah, um, wel I, he's gonna play with us
'cause he makes nine.

Now we've got a whole team. We're
wasting time. Let's go to the sandlot.

Benny, it's 9:00 in the morning.
It's 9:00.

Why'd you bring him, Benny?
'Cause there's eight of us,
and he makes nine.

Why'd you bring him, Benny?
'Cause there's eight of us,
and he makes nine.

Yeah, yeah, so would my sister,
but I didn't bring her.

With nine guys we've got
a whole team, Yeah-Yeah.

No. With Elswenger
we had a whole team.

Elswenger could catch.
And throw.

Come on, Benny, man.
He ain't game.

You saw the way he threw.
Yeah.

You already fill up all
the empty positions since
Elswenger moved to Arizona.

Right. And now I get to rotate
eight positions instead of seven.

I need the practice, guys.
You're the best on the team.
You don't need any practice.

No, you don't.
You're the best, man.

Come on, Benny, man.
The kid is...

a L-7 weenie.

Yeah, yeah.
Oscar Mayer even. Foot-long!

Dodger dog! A weenie!
[Boys Laughing]

What are you laughing at, Yeah-Yeah?
You run like a duck.

Okay, okay, but I'm-- I'm--

Part of the game, right?
Mmm, yeah.

Now, how come
he don't get to be?

'Cause he's a geek, man.
He can't catch.

Man, base up,
you blockheads.

Smalls, you take
left center, okay?

Okay. Um, where
exactly is that?

It's over there, man.

Here?

That's left.
I said left center.

Okay. Right.

Here?

Come on, Benny, man.

He's never gonna catch the ball anyway.
Let's just play.

What a jerk.
Yeah-Yeah, get two.

Come on!
Throw it in here, Bertram!

Nice.
Wow!

Good job!

Hey, Smalls, throw it to second.
Okay.

[ Gasps ]

Come on, Benny.
He's never gonna catch it.
He's not gonna catch it.

[ Grunting ]

Oh! I told you, Benny.
We told you.

[Dog Growling]

Come on, Benny.
Why'd you do that?

A square, Benny.
The kid's a square.

[ Growling Continues ]

Come on. Throw it in.

What the hell's he doing?

I don't believe this.

Here. Sorry. Sorry.

You can throw it, you know.

No.

I can't.

I don't know how.

Thanks for taking me here,
but I think I'd better go.

Hey, hey.
You think too much.

I bet you get straight A's
and shit, huh?

No, I got a "B" once.

Actually an A-minus.
But it should've been a "B."

Man, this is baseball.
You gotta stop thinking.

You just have fun.

I mean, if you were having fun,
you would've caught that ball.

You ever have
a paper route?

I helped a guy once.

Okay. Well, chuck it like
you would throw a paper.

When your arm gets here,
just let go.

Just let go.
It's that easy.

How do I catch it?

Just stand there and stick your glove
out in the air.

I'll take care of it.

About time, Benny.
My clothes are going out of style.

They already are, Squints.
Shut up!

I told you, Benny.

Smalls, throw it to second.

Okay.

[ Groans ]

Not again.
[ Spits ]

We're wasting time, Benny.

Please catch it.

Please catch it.

Please catch it.
Please catch it.

Yeah!

All right!
He's all right.

I told you so, man.

Okay.

Let's play some ball.
Yeah, let's play some ball.

All right.
I knew it... all the time.

Yeah!

[Dog Growling]

[Fence Rattling]

[ Gasps ]

I'll show you some more
tomorrow, okay?

Okay. Bye.
You did good.

See you later, Ham.
8:00 tomorrow.

8:00, Benny?
Yeah. See you later, Smalls.

Bye. See you tomorrow.

Benny, wait!

Your glove.
Keep it, man.

Thanks!

Oh, yeah.
Hey, Smalls.

Um, bring a T-shirt
and jeans tomorrow, okay?

Oh, um, you got a fireplace?
Oh, yeah.

Yeah, why?

Throw that hat
in there, man.

Oh, yeah. You know,
it was the only one I had.

Not anymore.
Wear my old hat.

8:00 tomorrow morning.

Thanks, Benny.
Great. 8:00.

Mom, guess what?

Hamilton "The Babe" Porter.
[ Chuckles ]

"Long-ball" Porter.

Come on, DeNunez.

[ All Laughing, Taunting ]

Yeah, okay.
Yes, I see it. Yes.

[ Boys Shouting ]

Whoa!
[Boys Laughing]

You call that pitching?

This is baseball,
not tennis.

Give him a tennis racket.
Give me something to hit.

All right, Ham.
This is my heater.

I dare you to hit it.
You'll be sorry.

Give that boy a bigger bat.
You want the heater,
I'll give it to you.

Give him a basketball.
Maybe then he'll hit it.

[Clattering]
Oh, man!

Yeah!
That's how you do it.

Ham, you idiot.
Now we can't play no more.

Great, you idiot!

Hit me with the heater.

Stupid idiot!

Low and outside.
Just like I like it.

I'm gonna hit you!

Wait a sec. I'll get it.
[Ham] 1932 called shot
World Series by The Babe.

Called shot by the Babe.

No!

[ All ]
No!

[Boys Shouting]

Smalls, come back!
Hey guys, I'll get it!

Smalls!
Smalls!

What are you doing?
Smalls, wait!

Guys, what are you--
[ All ] Smalls!

Get off!
Guys, I gotta get the ball!

No, wait!
Get off of me! Now!

You're gonna get yourself killed!
Killed, man, jeez!

Stop!

Holy crap,
you could've been killed.

Yeah, yeah, truly.
What are you doing?

You guys were leaving,
so I just thought I'd hop the fence--

If you were thinking, you
wouldn't have thought that.
You can't go back there.

Then how do we get the ball back?
We don't.

We don't.
It's history.

It's history. Kiss it--
Kiss it good-bye. Shut up, Tommy.

It's gone, man. Gone.

Game's over, man.
We'll just get another ball tomorrow.

Yeah.
We'll never see it again.

Why not?

[ All ]
The Beast.

What is that?

Smalls, listen to me.

Go to that fence... real slow,
and be quiet.

But... I-I think--
No, no, no. No, no.

-Just go and peek through that hole.
But I--

-But I saw something. What's back there?
-It's okay. Just go.

-Just go.
Go, Smalls.

Come on, Smalls.

[ All ]
Shh!

[Boys Whispering]

Shh!

Shh!
Be quiet.

[ Growling ]
[ Gasps ]

Something got the ball.

W-What was that thing?

[ All ]
Camp out.

# In the jungle
the mighty jungle #

# The lion sleeps tonight ##

Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

My mom made me put on my jacket,
Shut up!

and then she made me do the dishes.
[ Boys Laughing]

Your poor little mommy
made you do the big bad dishes.

Hey, you want a s'more?
Some more what?

No, no, you want a s'more?
[Boys Chattering]

I haven't had anything yet,
so how can I have some more of nothing?

Shut up!
You're killing me, Smalls.

All right. Who cut one?
These are s'mores stuff.

Okay, pay attention.
Bertram!

First you take the graham.

You stick the chocolate
on the graham.

Then you roast the 'mallow.
No, it's my sleeping bag.

When the 'mallow's flaming,

Yes, it is yours.
It has a yellow stain on it.

you stick it
on the chocolate.

You're gonna set the place on fire.
Then...

you cover it with the other end.
Make me one of those.

Yeah, me too.

Then you stuff.
I don't like that chocolate stuff.

Kind of messy, but good.
Try some.

Okay. Quiet, you guys.

[ Chattering ]
Shh! Shh!

Quiet! Are you trying
to wake it up?

It just went to bed.

What just went to bed?
[ Boys ] Shh!

The Beast.

Oh, yeah!
Shh!

-Jeez.
Dang.

Shh.

Now quiet.

The legend of The Beast
goes back a long time...

before any of us
could even pick up a baseball.

Back to a place
called Mertle's Acres.

It all started about, mmm,
20 years ago,

when thieves kept stealing junk
from Mertle's Acres junkyard.

So Mr. Mertle, the guy
that used to own the place,

got him this new pup
from the dog pound.

He fed him whole sides of beef...

and turned the pup loose
in the junkyard.

And the pup was grateful.

[ Thunderous Footsteps ]

And so, in a few weeks,
the pup grew into The Beast.

And he grew big,
and he grew mean...

so that he could protect the junkyard
with only one thing on his mind:

to kill everyone
that broke in.

And he did, and he liked it a lot!
[ Men Screaming ]

The Beast was the most perfect
junkyard dog that ever lived.

A true killing machine.

But after a while, the cops started
getting phone calls from people...

reporting all the missing thieves,

the ones The Beast had killed.

It added up to about 120--

173 guys.

It's true.
[ Growling ]

They never found a single body.

Not one. Some people say
they all got away.

But we all know
what really happened.

The Beast ate them.

He ate them bone and all.

The Beast was too good
at his guard dog job,

so the police said
he had to be retired.

My grandpa, Squidman Palledorous,

was police chiefback then.

He ordered Mr. Mertle to turn
his backyard into a fortress...

and chain up The Beast
and put him under the house...

where he could never get out
to eat children and stuff.

That's where he's been for 20 years.
[ Growling ]

And that's where he'll be
for the rest of his life.

Because Mr. Mertle
asked the cops how long...

he had to keep The Beast
chained up like a slave,

they said until forever.

Forever. Forever.

Forever. Forever.

Forever.
[ Echoing ]

And so, The Beast sits there
under that lean-to,

dreaming of the time when he can
break the chain and get out,

dreaming of the time
he can chase and kill again.

See, man? That's why
you can't go over there.

Nobody ever has.
Nobody ever will.

One kid did, but nobody
ever seen him again.

That ain't true.
Yeah, it is.

He got eaten.

Nuh-uh.

No. None of that's true.

You guys are just making this up
to scare me.

Oh, yeah?

Stick your head
out that window...

and look down.

[Scotty Narrating] That night I
learned that more than 150 baseballs...

had gone over that fence and not one
of them was ever seen again,

even when some brave kid...
[ The Beast Growling ]

worked up enough courage
to peek over.

Because when they went over,
they vanished.

I knew it was true.

Because when I looked down in there,
[ Growling Continues ]

I didn't see a single solitary one.

[ Chain Rattling ]
[ Screaming ]

He's down there.
You bet he is.

Whatever goes over that fence...

stays there.

It becomes the property
of The Beast...

forever.

Come on, give it to me.
No, I wanna carry it.

Come on. I paid for it.
I wanna carry it.

Oh. Whoa!
Give it to me.

# There goes my baby #
Jeez Louise.

What's the matter?
Jeez.

# Movin' on down the line #

Come on, let's go. We gotta get--
No!

We gotta get to the sandlot. Let's go.
# Did she really love me #

[ Chattering ]
# Was she just playin'##

Come on. Let's go.
Okay.

[ Panting ]
I'm sweating like a pig.

Let's go! Come on!

Where you guys been?
We've been waiting here forever already.

Aw, Squints was pervin' a dish.

Shut up. I wasn't.
Yeah, yeah, you were.

Your tongue was hangin' out of
your head, and you was swoonin'.

Oh, Wendy Peffercorn,
my darling lover girl. [ Chuckles ]

I said shut up!

I've got a lot of things
on my mind.

This pop isn't working, Benny.

I'm baking like a toasted cheeser!
It's so hot here!

It's 150 degrees out there.
You can't play baseball.

You have to call it for the day.
You gotta listen to him, Benny.

Vote then.
Anybody who wants to be...

a "can't hack it" panty waist...

who wears their mama's bra,
raise your hand.

Yeah, I can handle that.
[ Chattering In Agreement ]

Fine, fine, fine!

Be like that.

So what are we gonna do?

[ Laughing ]

Scam pool honeys!

[Scotty Narrating] Benny would've
played ball all day, all night, rain,

shine, tidal wave, whatever.

Baseball was the only thing
he cared about.

But of all the things
we ever did besides baseball,

going to the pool
was what he tolerated best.

Even though none of us had
ever seen a Playboy magazine,

which we constantly lied about,
Hi.

we figured going to the pool was
the next best thing to being there.

I remember you.
Oh, sexy.

Hey, girls.

Cannonball!

[ Women Screaming ]

[ Scotty Narrating ] It wasn't really
the pool honeys like we said,

because if any one of them
had come up to any one of us,
we'd have just peed our pants.

We all went because--

well, because Wendy Peffercorn
was the lifeguard.

Aw, man.
Yeah, yeah. Too cool.

[ Timmy ]
She don't know what she's doing.

[ Tommy ]
She don't know what she's doing.

[ Benny ]
Yeah, she does.

She knows exactly
what she's doing.

I've swum here every summer
of my adult life.

And every summer,
there she is,

lotioning, oiling,
oiling, lotioning.

One day it became too much...
Smiling.

for Michael "Squints" Palledorous.
Smiling!

I can't take this no more!

Move!
And he did the most desperate thing...

Lotioning, oiling.
any of us...

had ever seen.
Lotioning,

oiling.

[ Chuckles ]

What's wrong with him?
What's he doing?

Three summers of this.
I think he finally snapped.

I don't know. But that's the deep end,
and Squints can't swim.

[ Shuddering ]

[ Giggles ]

[ All Shouting ]

[Shouting Continues ]

Somebody help him!
Squints!

Somebody help him!
Come on!

[ Shouting Continues ]

Move back. Move back.

Okay, I got him. I got him.
Come on up, Wendy.

Everybody move back.
Move back. Roll him over.

Never mind! Never mind!

Come on, Squints.
[ Exhaling Forcefully]

Come on, Squints.
Come on!

Squints!
[ Exhaling Forcefully]

Come on, Squints. Squints.
Come on, Squints. Come on.

Wake up.
Come on, breathe, would you?

Come on, Squints!
You can do it! Pull through, bud!

Come on, man! Come on!
Yeah, yeah. He looks pretty crappy.

Squints! Come on, man.

Oh, God, he looks
like a dead fish.

[ Boys ]
What?

You guys, he planned that!
He knew what he was doing!

# Oh, magic #

Michael "Squints" Palledorous
walked a little taller that day.

We had to tip our hats to him.

He was lucky she hadn't
beat the crap out of him.

We wouldn't have blamed her.
What he'd done was sneaky,

rotten and low... and cool.

Not another one among us
would've ever in a million years...

even for a million dollars had the guts
to put the move on the lifeguard.

He did.
He had kissed a woman,

and he had kissed her long
and good.

We got banned from the pool
forever that day.

But every time we walked by
after that,

the lifeguard looked down
from her tower,

# This magic moment #
right over at Squints...

and smiled.
# While your lips are close to mine ##

[ Boys Laughing, Chattering ]

# O beautiful #
[ Knocking ]

Get your glove and come on.
What's the big deal?

Night game. Come on. Come on.
Mom, I'm going out!

# In liberating strife #

# Who more than self #

[Fireworks Whistling]
# The country loved #

[Scotty Narrating]
There was only one night game a year.

Guys, wait up!
On the 4th of July...

the whole sky would brighten up
with fireworks,

giving us just enough light
for a game.

We played our best then
because, I guess, we all felt
like the big leaguers...

under the lights
of some great stadium.

Benny felt like that
all the time.

We all knew he was gonna go on
to bigger and better games,

because every time we stopped
to watch the sky on those nights
like regular kids,

he was there to call us back.

You see, for us,
baseball was a game.

But for
Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez,

baseball was life.

[ Boys Shouting ]
# And every grain divine #

Okay, hit it!
Yeah, yeah, come on, Benny.

# O beautiful #

# For spacious skies #

# For amber waves of grain #
[ Fireworks Whistling, Crackling ]

# For purple
mountain majesties #

# Above the fruited plain #

Now wait a minute.

I'm talking about--

# America #

# Sweet #

# America #

You know--

# God done shed His grace
on thee #

# He-He-He crowned thy good#

Yes, He did.

# In a brotherhood #

Man!
# From sea #

# To shining sea ##

[ Boys Shouting ]

Come on! Hurry up!
First!

Run!

Back off!

Yeah, yeah!

Throw it in! Throw it in!
Get him! Get him!

Come on! Come on!
Come on!

Come on! Hurry up!
Go, Benny!

[ Groaning ]
Oh, damn!

Oh, no!

It's easy when you play with a bunch
of rejects and a fat kid, Rodriguez.

Shut your mouth, Phillips.
What'd you say, crap face?

I said you shouldn't even
be allowed to touch a baseball.

Except for Rodriguez,
you're all an insult to the game.

Come on! We'll take you on
right here, right now!

Come on!
[ All Shouting In Agreement ]

We play on a real diamond, Porter.

You ain't good enough to lick
the dirt off our cleats.

Watch it, jerk.
Shut up, idiot!

Moron!
Scab eater!

Butt sniffer!
Pus licker!

Fart smeller!
[ Sniffing ] Ah!

You eat dog crap
for breakfast, geek.

You mix your Wheaties
with your mama's toe jam!

[ All ]
Yeah!

You bob for apples in the toilet
and you like it.

Ooh.
You play ball like a girl!

[ Laughing ]

What did you say?
You heard me.

Tomorrow.

Noon. At our field.

Be there, buffalo-butt breath.

Count on it,
pee-drinking crap face!

[ All ]
Yeah!

Let's go!

[ Chattering ]

We're gonna kick
their butts tomorrow.

Yeah!

Good job.
-Jerks.

Play ball!

Hurry up, batter.

It's gonna be a short game,
and I gotta get home for lunch.

[ Snickers ]
That's one.

You know, if I had a dog
as ugly as you,

I'd shave his butt
and tell him to walk backwards.

The heater.

Here it comes.
I dare you.

Strike three.
You're out.

Hey, is that your sister
out there in left field, naked?

She's naked.
Shut up, Porter!

Hey, hey, hey.

I'm just trying to have
a little friendly conversation.

Come on. You think
she'd go out with me?

Come on.
Show me your stuff.

Let's see what you got.
Hey, batter, batter, batter!

Take him out!
[Boys Shouting]

Come on!
Bring it in!

Oh! Beat ya.
[ Shouting Continues ]

Throw it to third!

[Scotty Narrating ]
We were all walking on air that night.

It had been a solid victory.

In fact, we beat the crap
out of those guys.

So we all went to celebrate.
