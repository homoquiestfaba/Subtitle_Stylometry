Oh, no.

Oh, this is not it.

All right, time for plan B.

All right, boys.
Let's get this place set up.

Sheila Mother-fing E.

Thank you, ladies.

Okay, everybody, settle down.
Settle down.

Welcome. We're gathered here
today to lay 2021 to rest.

Yes!

And I'll be honest, guys,

I started out this year
feeling very hopeful.

I had a whole vision
board party.

I had on there that Drake
would finally answer my DMs.

Yes!

2021, you literally had one job:

don't be 2020.

Yes!

But in the end, 2021 was
less of a new year

and more of a 2020 variant.

But we're not here to mourn.

Because I am declaring that
this right here, this,

is a celebration.

Woo!

Woo!

Megan, hey, so,
we talked about this.

Can you...
Oh.

Mm-hmm.
Okay.

I was, oh! Sat on my purse.

Scoot over, dude.

Where was I?

Yes, outside, things were
starting to slowly open up.

And then bam, we got hit
with the Delta variant.

And I was like,
oh my God, what's next?

The AKA variant?

I've seen "Stomp the Yard,"
okay?

White people, I am referring
to a movie about

a historically Black college.

Also, two historically
Black sororities.

We see you, Kamala Harris.

2021, you were quite a year.

You know, one day, we were
doing crossword puzzles,

listening to meditation apps
and teaching ourselves

how to convert a closet
into an office by

following along on
a TikTok video.

That was very informational.

Then suddenly, y'all,
game changer.

The vaccine was available
and we all got vaccinated

and the pandemic ended!

It's so funny
because it's not true!

But this year, we never quite
actually knew where we stood

with the pandemic.

2021 played with my
emotions so much,

I thought we were dating.

'Cause at first we was
cool, like, oh my gosh,

you do like me, stop.

And then it was like, wait, you
don't want to put a label on it.

What do you mean
we're just friends?

Like, am I ever
going to get a ring?

I'm asking so many questions.

Is this why I'm still single?

Because one thing I am ready
to leave behind

in 2021 is being single,

because look at me!

What a girl got to do
to get a date?

Okay?

Hey, Drake if you're listening,
I am great with kids.

Somebody toss me a baby,
come on, quick.

But at the end of the day,
okay, at the end of the day,

2021 was not a total bust.

So tonight, I have gathered
some of the funniest women

to help me celebrate 2021
for all that it gave,

for all that it tried to give,

and for all that it
would have given

if everybody just
got vaccinated.

By saying our goodbyes to it.

So to start things off for us,
here is the one, the only,

Chelsea Peretti.

Thank you, Yvonne.

Dearly beloved gathered
mourners of so many

different important topics,

tonight I'm here to say
goodbye to a very special

proprietary video
conferencing software program

whose name incidentally
rhymes with tomb.

Womb?

That's right, gang. Zoom.

Oh, yeah.

The best part about Zoom was

it gave us the opportunity
to work no matter what.

It allowed us to work
when we were sick.

Mm-hmm.
Right.

Distraught. When our children
were in grave danger,

we could still work.

Thanks for that, Zoom.

Thank you.

Zoom, because of you no longer
were our homes

a little safe zone
we could return to

after a long day at the office.

It was just all one big office.

Zoom, you gifted us
tropical beach backgrounds

that covered up our
putrid piles of laundry.

Mm-hmm.

Graciously masking our
unsustainable lifestyles

so we could continue
to be efficient cogs

in the wheels of capitalism.

All this with just
the click of a button.

I was clicking my button
last night.

You will not do this today.

Not today.
I'm not doing anything.

To me you're just
a little dark cloud...

Please don't make ice noise
while I'm talking.

I'm sorry little brat, I think

Zoom's going to be
around for a long time.

Don't you say that!

Oh, Zoom!

Without you how will
I make eye contact

with a bunch of people
that I can instantly tell

aren't going to do
business with me

and make it last for an hour?

Without you, how can I avoid
in-person socializing?

Um, I'm sorry, I thought
you liked

our backyard masked hangouts.

Oh, Stephanie,
you innocent lamb.

Baa.

That's because you don't drink
coffee compulsively.

My breath is not mask friendly.

I brought a quote.

"It's so hard to say goodbye."

Boyz II Men.

And they were right.

Goodbye to fixating
on my own dumb face

while pretending to listen
to 10 people drone on endlessly.

That's what I'm talking about.

And now, in Zoom's honor,

let's do a moment of
frozen silence.

I'm going to count you in.

One, two...

That was special.

It be like that,
it be like that.

And now the awkward
Zoom goodbyes.

Bye everyone.
Bye, great meeting.

I loved what you said.
Okay, bye.

Leave meeting, leave meeting.

Where's the red button?
Where's the red button?

Now her name may
mean something sweet,

but she hella spicy.

Dulce Sloan, everybody.

Hello.

Hello. Mmm.

Friends, I do, I did, I will.

Yeah!

Greetings, mourners.

This was the year we,
as a society,

collectively said goodbye
to being an asshole!

Now, there's so many ways
to be an asshole.

Being a milky white
Karen, screaming on the floor

of a Victoria's Secret like
your mother didn't raise you.

To being a happy
go lucky talk show host

who danced to a very
different tune

behind closed doors,
and yet, still off beat.

Oh!

And executive producing Jeopardy
just to name himself the host.

Quick clue, it was not
Levar Burton.

We love him.

For the longest time,
these assholes were allowed

to hide in plain sight.

They harassed.

Mmm!
Berated!

And acted as conservators
of their daughter's estates.

Free Britney!

Uh-uh, girl, the podcast
already freed her.

My tweet freed her!

Our tweeting freed her!

Yeah!
Yeah!

But after this year
the receipts came out

like cancellation confetti.

A reckoning happened,

and being an asshole
has gone to that great

NDA in the sky.

Yep, yep.

But for some reason, our
tolerance for them disappeared.

And I can't exactly put
my finger on why.

Actually, I can.

We got stuck inside again!

We got stuck inside.

And there was no hope.

And we lost it.

And everybody snapped,
we snapped.

I snapped like
Snap, crackle, pop.

We gone! We snapped!

And we needed to direct
our rage and frustration

at something tangible
to restore some justice

in an unjust world.

And assholes are right there
for the mass public shaming.

Uh, Lynae, what
is the expression

you're always using
on Instagram?

I'ma keep it Black,
but I'ma keep it brief.

Ah, that's the one, okay.
That one.

Now, you can't get away
with shit anymore.

Because right now everyone
is carrying around

the most powerful weapon
on earth.

A hydrogen bomb.

What?

No, friend. A smart phone.

Oh.

Now, listen, you can't be rude
to a hostess at a restaurant

and not think she's going
to go viral on TikTok

telling the world about it.

You can't go on stage and
be flat out homophobic.

No.

And you can't be a movie star

and privately tell women
you want to cannibalize them.

You cannot have your pussy
and eat it, too.

For the rich, powerful assholes,

there'll always be
public apology tours

and a Notes app mea culpa.

And eventually, that asshole
will join The View.

Oh!

Or be on "Dancing
with the Stars."

Or show their dick
that no one wants to see

to a bunch of aspiring comics

and sell out entire theaters
in Boston and Chicago

a few years later.

Yo.

You know what?

I gotta get canceled.

Mm-mm.

I've been playing this
all wrong.

I got to get canceled!

And I know exactly what to say.

Uh-huh.

All are.

No!

And that's why you can't mangy

to the

which is why I

Ha ha!

Oh...

Dulce, Dulce, hey.

I just got off the
phone with Hollywood.

This is my agent.
What's up, darling?

You're the next James Bond.

Ah! Look at Jesus.

Let's go.

Look at Jesus! Won't he do it!

I got canceled.
Can you do a British accent?

Oh, yeah,
I can do a British accent.

She can do a British accent.

Chip, chip, cheerio,
come get these towels.

We're doing this all wrong.

Wow.

All right, y'all, get ready, and
I do mean prepare yourselves,

because anything can happen when
Megan Stalter takes the stage.

Megan?

I'm just gonna touch up my face.

My magic 8-ball.

Just a second.

Okay.

Um... hi, yucky bitches.

Kidding.

You're all nice.

Well, most of you.

Um... anyways,
we are gathered here

to bid farewell to our
sweaty, beautiful

drunk friends with benefits,
Hot Vaxx Summer.

And if you don't know what
I mean by Hot Vaxx Summer,

you may know her by
her Christian name,

Slut Girl Summer.

Whatever you call her,
she was our horny little season

that could get it in
and get it down.

Reverse cowgirl style.

Wine me, dine me, 39 me.

Which is like 69,

but... shorter with
longer tongue.

And a shorter time.

That makes sense.

Anyways, even though she only
lived for a brief sticky season,

Hot Vaxx Summer gave me
a lifetime of memories

and unidentifiable
phone numbers.

Like hot accountant with hair.

Spooky Michael, he was fun.

Woman who looks like
Susan Sarandon, but mean.

She wasn't mean, but
she looked mean.

It was hot. It was really hot.

You don't have any idea
where this will fit.

Let's just say that.

Dizzy just thinking about her.

Anyway, when I think
about Hot Vaxx Summer,

I'm reminded of her
most important lesson:

sure, you can be vaccinated
against Corona virus,

but you cannot get vaccinated
against HPV.

Oh, actually, you can.

I love that energy, girl.

No, Meg, there's a real
HPV vaccine.

Love your spirit, biotch.

She don't even know me.

Anyways, Hot Vaxx Summer
is survived by

Force FiancÃ© Fall.

The only comfort I derive
from this is

how fitting it is that
in her final act,

Hot Vaxx Summer is
getting laid... to rest.

Love you, cunt.

My God!

Thank you.

Woo-ooo!

That was... very Megan.

Oh.

All right.

And now we are going to hear
from someone very special.

Guys, she's a little nervous,

so please join me in giving a
very warm welcome

to the extremely funny
Aparna Nancherla.

Girl, I have got
to take this off.

I can't look like this, hold on.

I hear you. Let me put it up.
Thank you.

Hi.

Hello.

Salutations.

So, um... anyone here
from out of town?

No crowd work!

Okay, I was just trying
to connect to my fellow humans.

Well, I'm here to say
goodbye to the hermit life.

This was the year we took off
the quarantine sweatpants

and put on the
socializing sweatpants.

Which are in fact
the same pants.

They were.

It's all about intent.
Like money laundering, you know?

I remember when
my hermit life all began.

I was watching TV, one of my
many friends who is a screen,

and, uh... it suddenly blared,

"Breaking news!
The CDC recommends"

everyone stay inside
indefinitely.

"Yes, we will continue to
be this ominous and vague."

You know, with my
bubbly personality,

pathological addiction to drama,

and cocaine filled
social calendar,

this was a big sacrifice for me.

But like millions of others,
I answered the call of duty,

even though I prefer texts,
I've made that very clear.

I immediately adopted
two small hangry cats.

I always bought a
Himalayan salt lamp.

No, I still don't
know what it does,

and yes, I have licked it
more than once.

I organized all my
mystery cords.

I advised my therapist
on jazzing up her background.

I stayed in shape by
doing the same workout

as Jennifer Lopez's
character in the movie "Enough."

Being a hermit was
a natural fit for me.

Actually, did you know
the word hermit

comes from the Greek word,
Eremites,

meaning "of the desert?"

Yeah, I know that because
I took an online Greek class

for eight days.

Day nine, the free trial
ended, so, you know...

Mm-hmm.

You know, without the
shackles of society

and peer pressure, I became
the most fully realized

version of myself!

Good for you!

I see you, girl.
Live your truth.

But then it all came
crashing down.

Oh.

Okay, I'm done crashing.

Reintegrating to society
was culture shock.

You know, my mind erased things
that weren't important anymore

like how to make small talk.

I tried to bring up
the weather recently,

and I said, "Oh, Sun,
Moon to rain, huh?"

Luckily, I learned
a few new tricks

from a very credible source
known as WikiHow.

If you're at a social function
where you don't know anyone,

try walking up to a stranger

and reciting an interesting
fact in an enthusiastic tone.

Like, "Hello",

did you know the word hermit

comes from the Greek word,
Eremites,

"meaning of the desert?"

Next, always have exit excuses
locked and loaded

whenever you're at a party.

For example, "Oh, I have to go!
I forgot I'm a doula!"

We're always on call."

Or, "Oh, the line to the
bathroom is very long."

I'm going to use mine."

And finally, don't forget about
your non-verbal communication.

You know, here's some classic
facial expressions

for everyday settings.

The "listening" face.

The "I think this story
is supposed to be funny"

"but it's not really
going anywhere" face.

The "I spaced out for
30 seconds and am now"

"overcompensating" face.

And finally, the "I have
clinical depression"

"and constantly remember that
none of this matters" face.

That's actually my resting
face, so...

Oh, I have to go,
I forgot I'm a doula!

We know that's a lie.

Duty...

Best of luck, Aparna,

and I hope you have a
safe and healthy delivery.

Thank you, it's my first time.

All right. And now...

Laying to rest something
gone far, far too soon.

Please welcome X Mayo.

That was fast.

I'm very good.

Ladies, I am here today
to lay to rest

"My Body My Choice"
bumper stickers.

R.I.P.

The slogan had a great run.

It was a mindset, a movement.

And a hard-earned victory
we won decades ago.

And it was a bumper sticker
that proudly declared

to all who passed, yes,
I am a white woman,

and I am listening to
Alanis Morisette in this Subaru.

But then 2021 happened.

And the Supreme Court
had the caucasity

to roll back
reproductive rights.

Unless you're rich.

First things first,
now that the Supreme Court

has ruled that our bodies
ain't none of our business

sex can have more consequences
than it has in a long time.

Now every time you hook up,
you have to ask yourself,

would this stranger
with no bedframe be

a good co-parent to my child?

No!

He don't even have sheets,
ladies.

Which is why I have a very
special presentation for you.

Hot wordless man?

Yes!

Ladies, I present
the 2021 Fuckbook.

Here are the people
you can have sex with

without the risk of
an unwanted pregnancy.

Yes, take a look.

This married family
values senator

and only man who's needed
a circumcision for his neck.

If he gets you pregnant, you
won't stay pregnant for long.

You may even get a private jet
to a clinic in Puerto Rico.

Mm-hmm.

All right, next step.

We have your Dad's
golf friend, Alan.

He's not going to let
a little mistake ruin things

for him and Eileen, oh, no,
she put him through law school.

Sleep with Alan, consider your
reproductive rights restored.

And last, you're going
to love this one.

Oh, yes.

Yes, the safest sex
of all is sex with yourself.

We all laughed at Gwyneth
Paltrow's vibrating jade egg

and now look at us,
we're sitting on them.

Facts, facts.

Which brings... you can go.

Which brings me to
another helpful idea

and you know how much
I have to get politi-cal.

But we need to regulate sperm
like we regulate guns.

Yes!

Everyone needs a sperm permit.
A spermit.

Speak on it.

And if that doesn't
solve everything right now,

as a special surprise,
one lucky audience member

has an IUD under her seat.

Ooh!
Yes, everybody look.

Oh, oh!

I got it.

Yes.

I never win these things.

Woo!

Sorry we can only afford one,
ladies, they're so expensive.

Mm-hmm.
That's it.

But let's just be clear,
this is not about

the horizontal mambo,

the ooey-gooey ciabatta.

The two headed beast.

You can just say sex.

Right, it's about so much
more than that.

It's about things hopefully
everyone agrees on.

Ending the cycle of poverty
by ensuring

people aren't forced
to have children

they cannot afford to raise.

And the government's interest
in babies shouldn't stop

as soon as they're born.

Yes!

And season three of "Succession"
took way too long to come out.

Yeah!

And where the
fuck is "Boondocks"?

Yeah!

What I'm saying is
we have to keep fighting.

Let's be honest, many of you
thought a new president

would solve all of our problems,

and that is because many
of you are white.

Yeah!

And ultimately, even though

"My Body My Choice" bumper
stickers are gone,

we can honor their legacy
by not giving in to apathy.

By not falling asleep
behind the wheel

because do you know who
sure as shit hasn't?

The motherfuckers who thinks
the vaccine

turns you into a magnet
and thinks JFK Jr.

Is a guy living in his van
in Pennsylvania.

They're dying for us
to lose momentum,

but will we?

No!

That's right, because if we
can muster up enough

fan outrage to bring back
our favorite cancelled show,

"The Connors"...

It's a good show.

Then we can do it for
our reproductive rights.

So I stand here before you today

itching in lace.

To ask you one simple question:

will you take this
fear and anxiety

and commit to doing everything
you can to make sure

we unfuck what they fucked up

so we can get back to fucking?

Fuck yeah.

That sounds real good to me.

And with that...

I have plan B for everybody.

All right, let's go...
One, two, three.

You're not gonna get pregnant,
you're not gonna get pregnant,

you're not gonna get pregnant.

Yes!

Thanks, ladies.

Wow, okay.

The ooey-gooey ciabatta.

Can't lie, I'm interested.

All right, ladies, we have
said goodbye to so much tonight,

but before we...

I'm sorry I'm late.

But you know I am
a living legend.

Miss Fonda, please.
It's an honor.

The podium is yours.

It's an honor.

Hello, my name is Jane Fonda,
I'm um...

Thank you.

Oscar, Emmy, Golden Globe
winning thespian.

Environmentalist,
political activist, arrestee.

And either I'm Grace
or Frankie, I'm not sure.

Um... Google me.

This year we said goodbye

to Ignoring the Climate Crisis.

The world's top 200 climate
scientists have called this

a code red moment for humanity.

Texas froze over.

Then the ocean caught fire.

New York City subways turned
into white water rapids

and Seattle got hotter than
that hotty from "Bridgerton"

who has nothing on you, dear.

Woo!

When things get
this cataclysmic,

I usually file for divorce.

Now that's a legend!

You probably assume that
I'm up here ready

to give a doom and gloom speech.
But no.

I've had a martini and a doobie
and I'm feeling kinda hopeful.

The fossil fuel corporations

aren't going to give up
fracking our future

and buying off our politicians,

so... we might as well
look at the bright side, right?

Mm-hmm.
Okay.

Nobody talks about how
the haze from wildfires

creates such incredibly
flattering light.

And sure, sea levels are rising
at an accelerating rate,

but doesn't that mean there's
more ocean front property

becoming available?

My grandson might never
see a coral reef,

but he will snorkel high
above the gorgeous

underwater city of Miami.

Plus, protesting the fossil
fuel industry is amazing cardio.

If I hadn't been
arrested repeatedly,

I wouldn't have this butt.

Stepping into police vans
has replaced my Stairmaster.

Talk about resistance training.

Yes, clever word play.

So basically, unless major
corporate polluters

are held accountable

and we vote out the politicians
beholden to them,

our days are numbered.

If it's just fossil
fuel corporations,

does that mean I shouldn't
feel bad about

my Fiji water soaking bath?

No, you should feel very,
very bad about that, Maggie.

Oh my God, Jane Fonda
knows my name!

That's not your name.

It is now.

So, let's enjoy the earth
while it lasts.

I'd like to propose a toast

to the planet.

Our only home.

And now if you'll excuse me,

I have to go scrub the oil
off a blue whale

down on Huntington beach.

Wow.

Jane "fabulous at any age"
Fonda. Oh my God.

We should all be so lucky.

Because if I'm being honest,

with everything that's going on,

I don't know about
y'all but I am tired.

Mm-hmm.

Nah, nah, scratch that,
I'm "tiH'd"!

With a capital "H'd."

Actually, if you don't mind,

I can't live like this no more.

Take them off!
What am I trying to prove, ok?

Do it.

Do it, do it, do it!

My foot hurt.

As I was saying, a hoe is tired.

And that's why I'm saying
goodbye to hustle and grind.

We live in a culture that
celebrates being on and popping.

All the time? Everywhere
we turn, we're being told.

That we always have
to be hustling.

What you doing?
What are you doing?

What are you doing?

You know, you work five jobs
and you have #nodaysoff.

You at the gym.
Yeah, you, at the gym,

and posting it on the 'gram,
look at me, it's leg day.

Ah!

Because if you don't post it,
did it ever happen?

Well, did it happen, Morty?
We get it.

Close your shirt up.
Close your shirt!

Close your shirt!

Just saying, like, what if
I'm too tired to go to the gym?

This is how tired I am,
my shoulders are high.

Just like this. I'm so tired.

We're so afraid that
if we just sit down

for one dag'gone second,
we're going to be left behind.

Left behind where?

They're already going
to space without us.

But this year, so many of
us said, you know what,

mmm-mm, enough is enough.
Yes!

And Black women who have had
to hustle and grind

twice as hard led the charge.

True!

"Simon Biles put her
3'4" feet down

and she stopped tumbling just
to prioritize her mental health,

and you know what?
She still won a medal.

Naomi Osaka taught us that,
"mm-mm" is a complete sentence.

"I don't want to"
is a good enough reason.

And Meghan Markle was so tired,

that that chick gave up
a whole entire castle, y'all.

That's how tired
Black women are.

We don't even want to be
princesses no more!

Speak for yourself, honey.

Okay, first you want
to be James Bond,

now you want to be a princess?

I'm trying to take over
England, baby.

No, everybody's tired,
even essential workers.

They rightfully asked,
"Y'all, if we're so essential,"

then how come y'all won't
provide us with,

"I don't know, a living wage
and health care?"

'Cause if covid don't get
you, a milk crate will. Ah!

I got that challenge
on my first try.

Oh, really, your first one?

You want to show us?

It takes me two hours
to set it up.

I'm too tired to even mess
with you right now, Aparna.

That's how tired I am.

You know, this was a year
that it became crystal clear

what we really wanted.

Some people moved out of
big, expensive cities

to live slower lives in
smaller towns closer to family.

And other people traded in
high powered corporate gigs

they have been working towards
since graduation

only to pursue their dream

of selling homemade
snicker doodle cookies

or mimosa scented body scrubs.

If anyone's interested
in hand-knitted dog booties,

you can visit my Etsy store.

Rachel, you got an Emmy
and an Etsy?

Girl, ain't you tired.

I love dogs.

At some point I'm going
to have to answer

to my mama when she asks,

"When are you going to stop
posting on Instagram

and give me some grandbabies?"

How does she think
I'm supposed to get the man

to give her these grandbabies?

Do you understand how
hard it is to explain

what a thirst trap is
to an immigrant mom?

Let me show you.

That is a thirst trap.

Basically, y'all, the
pandemic made me realize

that life is short.

And tomorrow's not promised.

So Drake, you really need
to answer my DMs.

And I'm proud of us,

because we're all
ending this year

very differently
than when we began it.

We're getting rid of everything
that did not serve us,

and we are embracing these
newer, beautiful versions

of ourselves

with a new set of priorities.

I mean, what are we all
working so hard for

if we can't enjoy
the fruits of our labor?

Yeah!

So tonight

I'm putting down
hustle and grind.

Bye bye.

And I am picking up
ease and flow.

Mmm.

Because you know what? Resting
is being productive, too.

When you're rested up,
you can show up for you

and for the people and causes
you actually care about.

You can't pour from
an empty glass.

And speaking of glasses,

it is time for me
to fill me up. Hello.

That's right.

Yeah!

So, as we bid farewell to this
year, let's raise a glass.

Pour out a little liquor for our
homies that couldn't make it.

No pouring out.

Okay, well, more for me.

So as we leave 2021 behind,

I am going to vow
to stay hydrated, hello,

moisturized, and
apparently BFFs with Jane Fonda,

'cause she looks amazing.

I'm gonna relax.

I'm gonna be rich and married!

Woo!

And I'm gonna go platinum again.

Oh my gosh, Alessia Cara?

Hey, Yvonne, love all this.

Girl, we are about to
do an in memoriam.

You have to sing.

No, I wouldn't want to...
intrude.

Mm-mm, stop it. I insist.

No, I really, I couldn't.

I ain't gonna beg you.

â™ª Every night in my dreams â™ª

â™ª I see you, I feel you â™ª

â™ª That is how I know you go on â™ª

â™ª Far across the distance â™ª

â™ª And spaces between us â™ª

â™ª You have come
to show you go on â™ª

â™ª Near, far, wherever you are â™ª

â™ª I believe â™ª

â™ª That the heart does go on â™ª

â™ª Once more, you open the door â™ª

â™ª And you're here in my heart â™ª

â™ª And my heart will
go on and on â™ª

â™ª You're here â™ª

â™ª There's nothing I fear â™ª

â™ª And I know â™ª

â™ª That the heart does go on â™ª

â™ª We'll stay â™ª

â™ª Forever this way â™ª

â™ª You are safe in my heart and â™ª

â™ª My heart will â™ª

â™ª Go on and on â™ª

You sing it.

Have a healthy and
happy new year, loves.

See you guys in 2022.

What a year.

Hello.

It's really special
to be on a set

with all women.

Come up.
Okay.

And then back down.

Yeah, be pregnant.

There we go.

I like candids.

Ma'am!

There are going to be
a few reactions.

Guys, we have one more
shot before...

Oh my gosh, Jane Fonda walks in.

The air in the room just goes...

This?

Or...

If covid don't get you,
a milk crate will. Ah!

She went full James Brown.

Do y'all want a different read?

You're a little dark cloud
that just passes...

What'd you say? What'd you say?

Please don't do that.
I can't hear you.

So we can get back to fucking!

That sounds real good to me.

Aparna, you be fucking?

Oh, yeah, when I can.

And now I'm gonna sing.

Don't play that piano.

â™ª Divorce daddy don't â™ª

â™ª Divorce daddy â™ª

â™ª Don't leave â™ª

â™ª Get thee behind â™ª

â™ª Cause what? Joy today â™ª

See you again next year.

All in a day's work.
