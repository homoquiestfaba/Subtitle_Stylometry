NARRATOR: Due to the content
of the following motion

Picture... [music playing]

MAN: Slip.

That's right, Dan.

NARRATOR: Viewer
discretion advised.


Hi.

Hi.


Justice in this
country has faltered.

Issues that were once black
and white are now gray.

And perhaps the greatest blow
to this state's political right

Is the outlying of
capital punishment.

And what does that mean?

It means we're having a
blowout clearance sale!

Hey, I got gas chambers.

I got electric chairs.

I got...

Hi.

That's right, Dan.

Now only 39.99.

Only used once.

OK, twice.

But he was real thin.

Made in Holland.

Real wood.
That's wood.

Wood, wood.

[Harmonica playing]

Did you hear about Luke?

Luke?

What happened to Luke?

He's riding through
Apache country.

They strung him up, left
him to bake in the sun.

Apache justice.

It must have taken him
six days to die of thirst.

I've seen worse.

Me too.

Well, who hasn't?

Hey, no one has
suffered more than me.

I lasted 20 days in the
desert, no food or water.

My tongue swollen, blinded
by a scorpion sting.

I had to crawl by my sense
of touch till I found water.

It was a miracle that
I made it at all.

Goddamn cakewalk.

Summer vacation.

COWBOY 1: Hey, I ain't
saying I ain't seen worse.

I'll tell you about pain.

I'm working at a
blacksmith's shop.

Horse kicks me across the room,
breaks my neck, snaps my spine.

And I gouged my eyes out
on two red hot pokers.

I'm laying there, totally
paralyzed, couldn't move.

I crawled across the
room with my tongue,

Forged a new nervous system
out of clay, used my face.

Stood up, popped my eyes back
in, finished shoeing the horse.

Don't tell me about pain.

It still hurts when
I... when I look.

So what was the painful part?

I've put in new eyes
three times this month.

Yeah, well, who hasn't?

I'm just telling you
the last time I did it.

COWBOY 2: It's not
as bad as the time I

Fell off the cliffs of Carmel.

Fell 1,000 feet to the
rocks below, broke into 53

Pieces, washed out to sea.

Sharks smelled the blood
from 600 miles away.

They ate me in
seconds, shit me out.

I washed back ashore.

It took me 10 years to put
myself back together, boys.

At times, I just
wanted to give up.

Quitter.

It happens to everybody.

COWBOY 1: At least
you were still solid.

Not like me.

I was digging for gold
in the high Sierras.

I dropped a match.

Blown up crate of dynamite.

Floated like a fine
mist for 17 years.

Finally, I condensed
on a window.

I had a chance to heal.

You talk about pain, boys.

I still get a twinge in
my knee when it's cold.

Nothing matches the time
I almost bled to death.

No wound ever shed more blood.

I thought I was Old Faithful.

COWBOY 2: My bullet wound did.

I bled for a week, a
month, pumped gallons.

Oh, yeah?

Did you ever see a wound
bleed more than this?

Right through the artery.

A wound like that will
kill a man in minutes.

The most painful one ever known.

COWBOY 2: From a glass cut?

Don't make me laugh.

Flesh wound, mosquito bite.

All the same.

You want to see pain?

Hot, searing metal burning
through my bone, point blank.

Now you got blood and pain.

Bullet wound.

That can't do no serious damage.

That's like saying
your goddamn grace.

Amen.

Now with this dull blade, it'll
probably take me 30 minutes

To cut all the way through.

Then we'll be swimming
in blood, boys.

COWBOY 2: Swimming?

Shit.

I'll drown us.

Top that.

Whole back of my brain's
been sheared off.

COWBOY 1: Ain't much to lose.

You've never seen
so much blood.

You're making it easy
on yourself, both of you.

I work with my hands.

[Bones cracking]

Don't tell me.

I once through my
spine out on a dare.

I had to crawl
home with my lips.

Stop sawing, Bill.

I think he's got us.


Axes, guillotines,
rifles for firing squads.

That little syringe
that... wardens,

Can you still kill
in your state?

Give me a call.

I got it all.

Look at this
fabulous gas chamber.

It could have spent
the rest of time

Eliminating the world's
scum from the earth.

But now it's a sauna, a
play room for the kids.

You'll always know
where they are.

[Music playing]

NARRATOR: It.

A tractor is always there
when you least expect it.


My patient, Ted Smith,
displays the most severe

Case of multi personality
ever documented

In psychiatric history.

This study of his
four complete personas

Will guarantee me
international fame and fortune.

The movie rights alone!


Yes, Mrs. Palnor.

Doctor Dolbrite, Ted
Smith is here for his one

O'clock appointment.

Wonderful.

Send him in.

Uh, which Ted Smith is that?

Randy Ted Smith.

Ah, yes.

A teenager.

Hi.

Hi, Doctor.

Uh, Sir.

Uh, Dol... uh, Dolbrite.

Doctor.

Sir.

Hi.

Hello, Randy Ted Smith.

How are you feeling?

Oh, I'm OK, Doc.

Well, shall we begin
where we left off?

If you want.

That's fine if you want to.

If, um... I mean, if you
want to, that... that's

Fine because if... if,
um... what'd you ask me?

Now Randy, we're here to
do what you want to do.

I'm here to help you.

You must consider
me your friend.

Are you still having
difficulty talking to girls?

No.

Yeah.

If they're there,
and I have to look.

No.

Uh-uh.

DOCTOR: That's fine.

You can't expect
too much too soon.

You have an abnormal
fear of women.

It may take years before you're
comfortable being with one.

Ironic, but that's the
only kind of relationship

That will cure you.

I... I am kind of
seeing this one girl.

Drop her.

She's a slut.

You must accentuate
the negative.

It's more positive.

Now, I'd like to try some
word association with you.

It's very simple.

I say a word, and then
you say the first word

That comes to your mind.

This will help me to understand
your subconscious desires.

TED: Hey, OK.

The first word is nipple.

Bottle.

Breast.

Chicken.

69.

70.

Screwing.

Wood shop.

You're obviously
obsessed with sex.

This, compounded with
your fear of women,

Has led to your severe state of
psychopathological micro macro

Neuro organic condition of
external internalization.

Don't you agree?

TED: Well, I didn't...

I'm not trying to put
words in your mouth.

No.

DOCTOR: Right?

I don't know anymore.

Um, look, I'm just
saying, Doc, I mean,

Every time I go out with a
girl, it's the same thing.

We go out, and I like her.

And, well, I think she likes me.

And... and then it all starts.

Tell me about it.

OK.

Every time I go out with a
girl, it's always the same.

CREEPY VOICE: Just friends.

Just friends.

Oh, Randy, I feel
a little awkward.

I like you.

I really do.

But...

Gee, Sissy, what's wrong?

I want to be just friends.


CREEPY VOICE: Just friends.

Wendy.

Just a kiss?

You said you loved me.

I do love you, silly,
but like a brother.

A brother?


We've always thought of
you as one of the family.

But keep it just friends.


CREEPY VOICE: Just friends.

I had a wonderful time,
but I have a boyfriend.

But you didn't say...

CREEPY VOICE: Just friends.

No.

No, please don't.

Wait.

Like a brother to me.

Just friends.

No sex.
TED: No.

No.

Spend money on me.

Like a brother to me.

Just friends.

I just want a... I
just want a... a kiss.

No.

No.

Just friends.

Just friends.

I don't want to die a virgin.

Just friends.

No!

Welcome to the Time
Channel, cable's

Newest network and television's
only 24 hour time service.

It's 11:53 in New York.

Now off to Spidey Upman,
our correspondent overseas.

Hi, Roger.

I'm here in beautiful, sunny
Greece at the Svoronish Fish

Docks just outside of Athens,
where the time is 6:53.

Back to you, Rog...

[Music playing]

MAN: Slip it on.

Hi.

Welcome to Verne and Ralph's
Tractor Emporium and Bait Shop.

This here is Ralph.

He's my brother.

Say hello, Ralph.

He's my brother.

OK.

This is a frying pan.

This is an egg in a frying pan.

Any questions?

Hi.

My name's Julio, and this
here is my brother Buck.

OK.

This is a blender.

This is a tennis
shoe in a blender.

Any questions?

DOCTOR (NARRATING):
My last session

With Ted Smith made me nervous.

The Randy personality is
becoming too well adjusted.

The officers from the American
Psychiatric Association

Arrive today.

To ensure my place in
history, it is imperative

That they witness the
shredded mental fabric

Of this intensely demented man.


Yes, Mrs. Palnor.

Sir, Ted Smith is back.

Oh, that would be
Lieutenant Ted Smith.

SECRETARY (ON PHONE): Yes, sir.

Ask him to come in.

Atten-hut.

As you were.

Well, Lieutenant Ted Smith.

I see you still have a need
to control and dominate.

Not at all.

That's absurd.

Mister, you have an ashtray
clearly visible on your desk.

You're in violation of city
ordinance 509-306-589-182,

Which clearly prohibits the
use of smoking paraphernalia

In a public place
of less than 20

Foot by 32 foot with a ceiling
of 10 foot by one inch.

Mister, you will remove
your ashtray now.

Now, Lieutenant, you know if I
remove this ashtray as you have

Ordered me to do, I
would be reinforcing

Your delusions of
grandeur and perpetuating

Your mental illness.

Now shall we begin by reviewing
our last session together?

Communist faggot
queer pinko bastards.

That about sums it up.

Let's move on.

Now I'd like to try
an exercise with you.

Push ups?

I can do 170 in 39 seconds
flat, 494 squat flats.

No, it's not that
kind of exercise.

It's designed to demonstrate
your creative aptitude.

By building something useful
out of common objects,

You can develop self confidence.

We'll start with
three common objects.

A toothbrush.

TED: Yeah.

DOCTOR: A balloon.

TED: Mm-hmm.

DOCTOR: And half a
pastrami sandwich.

When do I begin?

You can begin now.

TED: Here you go.

I didn't have to
use the toothbrush.

DOCTOR: I don't think that
shows any aptitude at all.

You're obviously
still a failure.

How do you account for that?

Because of the decay of the
infrastructure of society,

The infiltration of undesirable
minority groups, ethnic

Affiliators.

Why if I was running
this country,

I'd do things differently.

I'd be the cotton swab that
takes the wax out of the ears

Of this great nation.

I'd be the deodorant to rob
the stench out of the armpit.

I'd be the douche to
take the vaginal odor out

Of every God-fearing Christian
that walked this earth.

We went into business
so that we could live.

So live a little.

No.

We went into business
so you could live,

And I could get an ulcer.

[Music playing]

MAN: Slip.

It.

On.

Slip it on.

I could never wear
one of those things.

Oh, you've got to now, man.

You've got to.

BUSINESSMAN 1: Hi.

Um, how about a cognac?

BUSINESSMAN 2:
Anything on draft.

BUSINESSMAN 1: Here, let's put
it on the company credit card.

BUSINESSMAN 2: Let's not.

There's no money in the bank.

You worry too much.

Yeah, well.

If Parker pays us tomorrow...

BUSINESSMAN 1:
Jesus look at that.

BUSINESSMAN 2: Out
of your league, pal.

Don't take it too hard.

Thank you.

Thanks.

I think she likes me.

I think you're dreaming.

In fact, you only read about
women like that in your dreams.

You know what I'm saying?

Cheers.

BUSINESSMAN 1: Uh-oh.

That's it.

That's it.
Don't even-

That's it.
Stop.

That's it.
No.

That's it.

Bad time.

Here, let me get that.

That's, uh, a great brand.

You're very attractive.

Thank you.

What was that I saw you slip
into your pocket a moment ago?

Nothing.

Yeah, right.

So where's your wife?

BUSINESSMAN 1: Wife?

Who... who can afford a wife?

I hope that you are
the discrete type.

Oh, yes.

I'm... I'm very discrete.

You have wonderful hands.

Thank you.

And you have wonderful...

Hey.

You want to try
to keep it decent?

Do you want another drink?

No, no.

Come with me.

BUSINESSMAN 1: Where to?

My place.

You're so beautiful.

Don't stop.

Freeze!

What the hell?
What's this?

Guns!

Get out of my house.

This is a private home.

What are you doing?

Do you know these people?

No!

I said freeze, mister.

Marijuana, sir.

Hey, wait a minute.

A .38 revolver, sir.

Hey, wait.

Now I have a permit for that.

You guys got a warrant?

OFFICER 1: Read 'em
and weep, mister.

Hey, wait now.

I'm not a criminal.

What are you looking for?

No condoms, sir.

That's it.

No condoms.

Just as I suspected.

Condoms?

You're looking for condoms?

What do you think
I'm looking for?

Drugs?

Guns?

BUSINESSMAN 1: Well,
who are you guys?

We're PRICs, mister.

BUSINESSMAN 1: No kidding.

Prophylactic Regulatory
Intercept Commandos.

BUSINESSMAN 1: This
is a joke, right?

OFFICER 2: Mister, there's
one thing I don't kid about.

I'm talking serious.

You bet your goddamn
sweet guarantee you.

You find this funny?

You think there's something
funny about spreading

Sexual diseases?

Well, I don't think so.

That is why it is now
a crime to partake

In unprotected sexual activity.

You're crazy!

How... how will you ever
enforce a law like that?

OFFICER 2: What you got
in your bloomers, mister?

What do you think?

I think it's a
concealed weapon.

Confiscate it, Sergeant.

Hey, wait a minute.

Ow.

SERGEANT: How long have
you known this man?

Uh...

OFFICER 2: Five years?

Why?

SERGEANT: You'll be found guilty
unless you've been sexually

Active with him only in
a monogamous relationship

For five years.

Well, a... actually,
we just met.

He seduced me.

That's harassment.

Offering helpful promptings to
a witness is perfectly legal.

What the hell is that?

Blood testing machine.

This machine will
determine your blood volume

Relative to your gamma globulin
fraction of immune serum

In your blood, indicating
any foul inactive diseases

Inside you.

Ow.

I don't have any
infectious diseases.

DOCTOR: Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Are we so sure now?

Is that why you're
so ready to dip

Your missile without the
protective silo sleeve?

You're so familiar with your
blood at a microscopic level

That you're ready
to sink your bayonet

Free of any vulcanized sheet
of temporary lamination?

I don't think so.

Do you have any idea how
much I hate you, mister?

I don't know what
you had planned.

You were going to take her
to a movie, weren't you?

Yeah.

And maybe you'd take
her to a restaurant,

Have a little
something nice to eat.

Weren't you going
to do that, boy?

Weren't you?
Weren't you?

Weren't you?
Weren't you?

Yes.
Don't you eyeball me.

Look at me.

Don't you eyeball me!

And then you were
going to take her home,

Whisper sweet gentle nothings
into her ear, get her real

And feel comfortable with you.

Weren't you, boy?

Then maybe you'd take her
home, sit by the fireplace,

Have a little glass of wine.

You probably drink that
white wine, don't you, boy?

You probably drink that white
Chablis kind of blanc wine

'Cause you're a faggot
ass penis smoking,

Dick smoking, butt slamming...
Boy, I know your kind.

And then just when you had
her really trusting you,

Just when you were thinking
every day you're apart

Is just agony and every
day together is just bliss,

That's when you'd get her.

You'd tell her things
you didn't even mean.

Wouldn't you, boy?

Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you?

Yes.

Don't lie to me.

Yes.

You really would?

You're disgusting, more
than I thought you were.

And then you'd take off those
little silky under things

She wears, and
you'd lick and kiss

Every supple rosy kind
of cheek kind of fat kind

Of part of her body.

Wouldn't you, boy?

And you'd like it
too, wouldn't you?

Yeah.

You make me sick.

And then when you
least expected it,

You'd look at her right
in the eye, leaning over.

You'd nibble on her lip.

And then blam-o.

Yeah.

In fact, that was the idea.

You know I'd kill every last
one of you if I had the chance.

Give me a terrorist
bombing any day.

It's much more honest.

OK.

Finished, gentlemen.

So what now?

The test results will
take six months to process.

So I... I guess I'm free to go.

Take the evidence, corporal.

Ow!

You'll be required to
wait for said test results

At the expense of the
state at a duly appointed

Place of incarceration.

You're putting me in prison?

Where they have an
adequate supply of condoms.

Ow!

Don't pull on that.

Young lady, are you all right?

Yes.

I think so.

SERGEANT: Good.

Test her, doctor.

What?

No!

No, please.

Please, no.

No.

Well, good work, sergeant.

We're living in an era
of sexual confusion.

Gone are the days
of promiscuity.

At the slightest
hint of behavior

Preparatory to fornication,
PRICs will move in.

If the offending couple
are found not wearing

Any form of
contraception, we will

Confiscate the weapons used,
in this case, penis and vagina.

So remember, always
wear a condom.

I'm wearing one now.

Remember, it's not
only a good idea.

It's the law.

You know something, sergeant?

I always liked you.

Got a condom?

[Music playing]

Hello, I'm Dan Tip.

And I'm Maria Gonzalez Smith.

Welcome to the "World
at War," the show

That brings you man's
deadly territoriality

Live into your living room.

That's right, Dan.

Democrat or Communist,
rebel or army, today, man

Will carve his own fate,
as the stakes are ultimate,

And the outcome is
yours to decide.

For our up close
and personal feature

Tonight, let's go to Charlie
Pinebowl and the Khyber Pass,

Where the ruthless
heroin trade has turned

This long and treacherous
mountain passageway

Into a deadly no man's land.

Charlie.

Thanks, Dan.

I'm standing here in the most
violent spot in the world.

Hi.

My name's Verne.

This here's my brother Nason.

We'd like to talk about our...

Thanks, Roger.

We're here in the gardens
of the palace of Versailles

Just outside of Paris,
where it's 5:53.

Hi.

My name's Verne.

This here is my brother Cleotus.

Oh, we have been in the tractor
business for quite some time

Now.

We have many tractors
for you to choose from.

Well, we have yellow
tractors and all kinds

Of other yellow tractors.

And we have one or two red
ones, like this one here.

So come on down to Verne's
and Cleotus's tractor bonanza

Sell out.

And remember our slogan.

Hi, I am a tractor.

It's 12:51.

Some of Ted Smith's
personalities

Are beginning to meld.

His recovery rate
is much too rapid.

This poor, tortured man may
soon find peace with himself.

I can't let that happen.


Yes, Mrs. Palnor.

Uh, Roger Ted Smith is
here to see your, Doctor.

Roger Ted Smith.

Send him in.

Roger Ted Smith.

Oh, yes.

The army vet.

How you doing, Doc?

Hello, Roger Ted Smith.

It's quiet.

Real quiet.

I like that.

Yes.

I know, Roger, that
sudden loud noises

May cause you extreme trauma.

I'm terribly sorry, Roger.

I didn't mean to frighten you.

I wasn't scared.

I was, uh, just
developing some film.

Mind if I smoke?

DOCTOR: Certainly not.

Go right ahead Why
don't you sit down?

I like to stand.

Then stand.

Why can't I sit?

Do whatever you like.

I'll stand.

It's a little bright in here.

Don't you think, Doc?

Oh, I don't know.

Do you think it's
too bright in here?

No.

Why do you ask?

You seem a little
jumpy today, Doc.

Well, shall we begin?

So how have you been since
the last time we talked?

Well, I'm nervous,
tense, hair loss,

Diarrhea, premature aging.

Good, you're improving.

Anything else?

Well, I, uh... I went to
the movies the other day.

DOCTOR: What did you see?

"Platoon."

"Platoon."

A movie designed to make you
relive your most terrible

Nightmares and anxieties.

Good choice.

What did you think?

Well, it brought back a
lot of memories for me,

What I was doing in the '60s.

See, I played a lot of
army when I was a kid.

Some of us came back
a little messed up.

You're doing fine, Roger.

Can I get you
something to drink?

Maybe another cigarette?

TED: No, thanks.

Don't smoke.

Gave it up years ago.

Yes.

Please continue.

Yeah.

I was there back in '72.

Billy's backyard.

That must have been very
difficult for you, Roger.

How do you feel about it now?

TED: Well, I'm OK now.

Sometimes I still
have nightmares.

Nightmares?

Yeah.

Sometimes I can still hear the
sounds of Billy's backyard,

Still hear it like it
happened only yesterday.

The sounds of Billy's backyard.

Bang, bang.
You're dead.

Am not.
Am too.

Am not.
Am too.

Am not.
Am too.

Am not.

Am too.

Oh.

Look, I'm sorry.

This is not going to work.

I got too much on my mind.

I'm sorry.

That's OK.

Don't worry about it.

This has never,
ever happened before.

It happened just
a few minutes ago.

Well, it's never happened
twice in one night, OK?

Jesus.

Honey, just relax.

TED: I don't know.

You've been working too hard.

You're just tense.

Just relax.

OK.

OK.

I'm concentrating.

Honey?

Mm-hmm?

Honey?

Mm-hmm?

Did you put the dog out?

I'm sorry.
OK.

I'm sorry.
All right.

I drifted.

It was a drift thing.

The dog, and I drift.

Go ahead.

Relax.

I'm very calm.

OK.

I think I, uh...
This is, uh... yeah.

Wait, wait.

There's just a hair.

I got a hair.

I'm OK.
All right.

Start again.
Here we go.

Here we go.
Wait, wait.

OK.

OK, now.

I'm thinking.

Just relax.

I'm totally relaxed.

I don't have a
care in the world.

I'm fine.

Wait a minute.

I think I feel something.

I think I feel something.

Do you feel something?

I think I feel something.

I think I feel something too.

Really?

Mm-hmm.

What?

Disappointment.

Oh, forget it.

Just forget it, all right?

Do you have this
problem in your own home?

Men, tired of the constant
embarrassment of not being

Able to rise to the occasion?

No lead in your pencil?

No starch in your collar?

Is your dick soft?

Well, worry no longer.

Your troubles are over.

And with her is our new
contender Annette Donahue.

Hello, Annette.

Hello.

BILL: Would you like to tell
us something about yourself?

No.

OK.

Let's get on with the game.

As you know, I'll be setting
you up with various obstacles

That you'll have to overcome in
order to win cash and prizes.


Yes, Eleanor?

That's not really true.

Is it, Bill?

BILL: Sure it is.

I've overcome every one of
your stupid obstacles every step

Of the way.

BILL: Yes, you have.

I've told secrets
about my husband

That's ruined his career.

I paraded around naked
for millions to watch.

I let you piss on me.

That's right.

And Boris, what do
we have for Eleanor

For being such a good sport?

ANNOUNCER: For being
such a good sport,

Eleanor has won
absolutely nothing.

Aw.

I'm sorry.

This isn't funny anymore.

BILL: We're just having
a little fun, Eleanor.

You can bet that today's
game is for real.

Whoever answers
this next question

Will get a chance at
our first obstacle

And today's grand prize.

Yes.

I want some cash now, damn it.

Clothes, washer,
dryer, anything.

I've earned it.

Answer the question
right, Eleanor,

And you might really
win something this time.

2 plus 2 equals...


Yes, Eleanor?

4.

That's absolutely right.


That's scary.

How do you select
people for this show?

By brain damage?

OK, Eleanor.

Your obstacle is
really quite simple.

Let's see some cash first.

Sure.

Boris, what is
Eleanor going to win?

ANNOUNCER: She's going to win
this incredible grand prize.

$1 million in gold.

Bullshit.

Really.

On the level, Eleanor.

Prove it.

What if I were to hand
you $20,000 in cash

As a down payment?

Yeah.

Now you're talking.

This is the first thing
you've actually given me.

All right.

Your task is quite
simple, really.

But today, because
the prize is so big,

We're really going to test you.

Our archers are set up on
the other side of the stage.

What?

You'll have 30 seconds to run
across their target course,

Retreat a tiny sewing needle
from the center of any

Of three bullseyes, and return
to me before the buzzer sounds.

Whoa.

What are the
archers going to do?

They'll be blindfolded and
shooting at their targets.

Fuck you.

You were the track star
in high school, Eleanor.

Fuck you again.

You'll have 15 seconds.

Well...

And there's plenty
more of this.

I don't know.

All right, Annette.
Step down.

Wait, wait.

All right.

15 seconds.

That's right, Eleanor.

Boris, start the clock.

Eleanor, go!

Oh, too bad.

She was so close.

Oh, you bastard.

She's done it.

She got the needle.

Let's see what
you've won, Eleanor.

Boris?

ANNOUNCER: For winning today,
Eleanor has won nothing!

Oh, I'm sorry.

No, I'm sorry.

That's.

Right $20,000 in
counterfeit bills.

What?

I'm sorry.

I'll kill you.

Oh, somebody get me some help.

Well, that's our
show for today.

Tune in tomorrow when
Annette Donahue becomes

Our first place contestant.

And Annette, your first
obstacle will be to fuck

The Olympic wrestling team.

Looking forward
to lots of prizes?

Yes.

I bet you are.

Goodbye for now.

DOCTOR (NARRATING): I am
encouraged by my last session

With Ted Smith.

Each personality is a
book deal in its own.

The officers of the American
Psychiatric Association

Arrive in 21 minutes
to access my findings.

Once they see him, I will be
recognized as the greatest

Psychiatrist of all time.


Yes, Ms. Palnor.

MS. PALNOR (ON PHONE): Ted
Smith is here for his five

O'clock appointment.

Oh, yes.

Tony Ted Smith, the
fourth and final one.

Ask him to wait a minute.

TED: Doc, how's it hanging, huh?

Hello, Tony.

How are you?

Hey, forget about it.

You know what I'm saying?

So what are we going
to do today, Doc?

Huh?

Color in some coloring books?

No, Tony.

Today we're going
to do something new.

These are ink blots.

I'm going to show you
these abstract shapes,

And I want you to tell me
of what they remind you.

Doc, you got entirely too
much free time on your hands.

You know what I'm saying?

What do you see in this?

That looks like a dick.

Good.

And this one?

That looks like a little dick,
like the other one, but little.

I see.

And this one?

You know who that looks like?

That looks like my friend Larry
Rubble, who sat in front of me

In the third grade.

Un-fucking-believable.

Just like him.

What a dick.

Tony, I think we should
concentrate on the things

That particularly bother you.

That way, I can really
get under your skin.

I mean, in a helpful
way, of course.

You know, Doc?

You know what bugs
the shit out of me?

I hate monsters.

They're such dicks.

I don't like the way they look.

I don't like the way they smell.

And I don't like
the way they dress.

You know what I'm
talking about, Doc?

The other night, right?

Check this out.
Follow me on this.

This is brilliant.

The other night, I'm
having a nightmare.

I must have been sleeping
because that's usually what

I'm doing having a nightmare.

I don't know if you knew that.

Write that down 'cause you
may, you know, use that later.

So I'm laying there, right?

And I'm dreaming about
these friends of mine.

It's spring break.

We're getting ready to go out.

They want to do the crazy shit.

I'm serious.

I'm saying, yo,
what am I, stupid?

What am I, crazy?

What am I, an asshole?

What am I, retarded?

What am I, a moron?

What am I, a nutcase?

What am I, a shrimp bag?

I know.

Let's go to Daytona Beach.

Like, totally boring.

Like, everyone goes to Daytona
for spring break, you know?

Like, let's do something,
like, totally different.

Ah, I got it.

Let's go to Vegas.

WARREN: I hear the women
in Las Vegas are beautiful.

What difference could that
possibly make to you, Warren?

Thanks, Spike.

Why are you always
putting me down?

Cause it's easy.

You're an asshole.

Well, Bobby and I have
come up with an idea

That's simply grand.

There's this neat house
over in the Everglades.

The people that lived there
moved a long time ago.

We can probably rent
it for the whole week.

Sounds swell, doesn't it?

You just used the word
swell in a sentence.

And the price is
quite affordable.

Why is it so cheap?

Is it a dump?

Well, as Bobby said,
it is in the Everglades.

That sounds, like,
totally different.

And, well, it is
kind of secluded.

We'll be all alone.

And, well, 12 kids got
killed there just last week.

Lets go.

Party!

BOBBY: It's agreed then.

Yo, yo.

Wait a second.

Wait a second.

What are you guys, crazy?

What are you, stupid?

What are you, morons?

We're college kids.

We're supposed to be
going to Fort Lauderdale,

Drinking beer, getting sick,
vomiting on each other,

Laugh at each other's underwear.

You know, that kind of... but no.

You guys want to go to
this deserted swamp area

Where there's no phone or people
for just hundreds of miles.

And well, 12 kids got
killed there last week.

What are you, a moron?

Oh, Tony.

You're such a stick in the mud.

Yeah, come on, Tone.

It'll be swell.

There's that word again.

Oh, why don't you come?

I'll make it worth your while.

Spike, I wear a condom
just talking to you.

BOBBY: All right.

Let's vote on it.

All those in favor, say aye.

Aye.

All opposed, nay.

What am I, a fucking horse?

It's decided.

We leave tomorrow.

Somehow, I get the feeling I've
seen this whole thing before.

[Music playing]

Well, this is it.

Jesus Christ.

Like, I totally got to go pee.

Oh, isn't it adorable?

Like, you guys.

I can't believe this.

The door is totally wide open.

Like, come on.

You know, Spike, I'm glad we're
going to have this time to get

To know each other better.

The truth is, I never
really had the nerve to tell

You how I feel about you.

And well, I wrote
this poem for you.

And I hope you like it.

Oh, shit.

I want you to have it.

It sort of says
everything that... that...

That I never could.

And I just wanted...

Thanks, Warren.

I know I've seen
this someplace before.

"13 Fridays,"
"Thanksgiving, Part Two."

Where have I seen...
Hey, did you see that?

That was a point of view shot.

Whenever they do a
point of view shot,

That means there's a
monster or something

Looking out the window at us.

A point of view.

Now what are you going to say?

Tony, what the heck
are you talking about?

I'm just saying, I see one
more point of view shot,

I ain't going in the house.



Whoa.


.

Whoa.

Radical.


Hey, let me the
get that, lamb pie.

Aw.

Why don't you join the
others in the house?

I'll get the rest of this.

Oh, pork chop.

Isn't he sweet?

What are you, crazy?

Looks like rain.

Of course it's going
to rain, you nimrod.

It's going to thunder
and lightning.

The window's going to howl.

We're going to have monsters,
more point of view shots,

Bada-bing, bada-bong,
with kibbles and bits.

It's going to rain.

BOBBY: Hey, come on, Tone.

You've been watching
too many movies.

All right.

Going in the house.

Please don't cut to
a point of view shot.

I'm begging you.

Don't cut to a
point of view shot.

Damn.

How come I got nine cards?

You guys are talking too much.

Are you cheating or what?

Wait, is it my turn?

It's my turn.
OK.

Gag me.

I can't believe how
totally boring this is.

I'm going out of my mind.

Where's all the action?

Aw, guys.

Come on.

It's not so bad.

Look, later we can
toast marshmallows.

And we can sing songs
around the fire.

I can't believe this.

Spring break.

I'm stuck in a haunted
mansion with some bitch

Who wants to break
into a rousing

Chorus of kumbaya, my lord.

Like, where's Spike?

She found out she had to do
a nude love scene with Warren.

So she cut out.

God, do you think
that she'll be OK?

What are you, kidding me?

It's raining out.

The wind is howling.

I got trees moving.

Just point of view shots.

The music has been totally weird
since we walked in this place.

Yeesh.

She's dead.

She probably won't even
get a screen credit.

Bummer, we're all out of beer.

Well, since I'm the only
one here without somebody,

I might as well be the one
that goes down and gets it.

Hey, Warren.
Come on.

Cheer up.

We're talking about Spike.

You can do better than her.

You think so?

Heck, yeah.

Thanks, Bobby.

I needed to hear that.

Come here, you.
Huh?

Come here.

What's the matter, huh?

Don't worry about it.

Don't worry about
nothing, all right?

Look at it this way.

Now that Spike's dead, she'll
probably be a lot nicer to you.

Huh?

Now get out of here,
you little fucking...

Hey, Warren, it's down
there next to that funny

Looking star thing
painted on the floor.

I bet some Jewish people
must have lived here.

Wait.

Boy, this stuff looks dangerous.

How'd that happen?

Oh, shit.

I cut my hand.

This looks serious.

Bring some bandages!

And Bingo was his name-o.

There was a farmer who had a
dog, and Bingo was his name-o.

G-O.

A guy could bleed
to death down here.

Bingo was his name-o.

Hey.

This could get infected, and
then I'd really be in trouble.

Can't you hear me up there?

Golly, all this excitement's
made me kind of sleepy.

Yeah, me too.

I guess it's time to turn in.

Good night, Karen.

Good night, Julie.

Good night, Rick.

Good night, Bobby.

Good night, Rick.

Good night, Julie.

Good night, Karen.

Good night, Bobby.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Shut up, will you?

Good night.

Sweet dreams.

Yeah, fuck the both of you.

Hey, uh, Karen, want to come up
to my room and see my etchings?

Totally awesome, yeah.

I'll be up in a few minutes, OK?

Great.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey.

Come here, you.
What's the matter?

What are you, crazy?

What are you, stupid?

What are you, a moron?

What are you, nuts?

What are you, retarded?

You can't have sex.

Hey, don't worry.

I brought protection.

No, you moron chipmunk breath.

If you have sex, you're
guaranteed to die.

Absolutely, you'll bite it.

Whoa.

I didn't think Karen
would be that good.

That's not what...

We're all gonna die.

I know it.

I just wish I could remember
where I've seen this before.

Like, what's an etching?

OK.

So far, everything
is hunky-dory.

As long as nobody does nothing
stupid like have sex or go

Looking for somebody in the dark
alone, we should be all right.

Excuse me.

Where did you go?

No, no, no.

Where did you go?

I was over there.

I came here to stop.

You cut away.

Who'd you cut away to, huh?

A monster?

Did you cut away to a monster?

Yes, you did.

Don't ever cut away to a
monster when I'm in a scene.

That scares me.

You stay with me.

I'm going to the bathroom.

You stay with me.

This way, I know I'm safe.

All right?
You come with me.

Hi, Tony.

Whoa!

Oh, Julie, you scared
the piss out of me.

There's piss all over.

I thought you were a big
monster with a bloody machete.

Nope.

I'll... I'll just be a minute.

I just have to wash
my face, comb my hair,

Brush and floss my teeth,
shave my arms and legs,

Moisturize, do my nails, tweeze
my brows, and, um... oh, yeah.

Weigh myself.

Tonight?

Well, yes, silly.

What was that?

Huh?

Oh, don't worry about it.

It's probably just
Warren or something.

We got the camera with us.

It's OK.

Listen, uh, I'm crazy about
you, you know what I'm saying?

I'm nuts.

And it's making me nuts
that I'm crazy about you.

You know what I mean?

Tony, you know
that Bobby and I are

Going to be married as soon as
daddy finds him the right job.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I know that.

I'm just saying, you
know, like, after we

Get out of here, maybe, uh, you
and I could, uh, get together.

We are together now, silly.

I'll let you know
when I'm finished.

But that's not...

Like, where's Warren, you know?

He's been gone for, like, ever.

Totally.

Don't worry about Warren.

He probably went to get
himself something to eat.

You know how much he likes food.


Like, Warren was
really feeling low.

You don't think he'd do
anything, like, stupid, do you?

Uh-uh.

What are you doing?

It's called... it's
called foreplay.

Oh, OK.

What's the matter?

Like, my straps keep
falling down, you know?

Where are you going?

I'm going to have
to go regroup.

I mean, freshen up.

Hold those thoughts.

Oh, and, like, bring some
puzzle cards back with you, OK?

And for her and my
protection, should be enough.

Ow!

Karen, girl, like it or
not, I am yours tonight.

Like, totally.

Hey, come on, Julie.

You in there or what?

Julie?

Oh, no.

Julie?

Julie?

Julie?

Julie, please answer me, Julie.

This is how it always starts.

I come looking for you.

I say, Julie, Julie.

You don't answer.

The music gets very strange.

The camera angles get weird.

See?

Julie, please don't be
dead behind in the bathtub.

Please don't be dead.

Oh, god.

Please.

Oh, thank god.

Whew.

You can straighten
the camera angle.

She's not dead.

Thanks.

That would be terrible
if she was dead.

I would hate to see
that, all chopped

Up in pieces in the bath tub.

You know, cause I
ain't fucked her yet.

Let me just have a bowl.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Oh.

I knew this would happen.

Christ on a crutch.

He's dead.

No shit, Dick Tracy.

Somebody chopped his
fucking head off.

Hey, Tone, Tone.
Calm down.

You don't know for sure.

You're jumping to conclusions.

We don't know if
somebody murdered him.

Who knows?

Maybe, um... maybe it
was just an accident.

An accident?

What are you, fucking retarded?

Like he was throwing up in the
toilet, and the lid came down,

Cut his head off.

What are you, a moron?

What are you, a shrimp basket?

What are you, an air head?

What are you, a ratchet wrench?

What are you, a hubcap?

Tony, Tony.

Hey, listen, man, you are
under a lot of pressure here.

Shut up.

Maybe we should
warn the others.

Fuck the others.

I'm out of here, pal.

I'm leaving.

Hey, Tone, you
can't just leave.

Yeah, watch me.

Oh, now, did you see that?

See what?

Over there.

What?

Well, show him.

Oh, come on.

That is not fair.

Hey, I don't see anything.

Yeah?

You are an asshole.

And so are you.

Rick?

Rick?

Rick?

Rick?

Rick?

Rick?

I just don't... don't
even believe this.

We have just got
to think rationally.

No, we don't.

We have to panic.

We have to get hysterical.

We have to freak out.

Well, call the police.

I don't even have
to check, man.

I know that the phone wires
have been cut already.

Haven't you ever
seen this before?

What are you, a moron?

What are you, stupid?

What are you, crazy?

What are you, nuts?

What we gotta do is
get out of the house.

Like, what's going on?

There's so much noise.

I totally can't sleep.

Like, where's Rick?

Listen to me, both of you.

Rick is dead.

Yeah.

Oh, god.

And we don't even
know how it happened.

Yes, we do.

There's a maniac running around
the house, chopping people up

And drop kicking them
into toilet bowls.

"Nightmare With an Elm,"
"Chainsaw Monster."

Don't you people
go to the movies?

Oh, Bobby, I'm so frightened.

Oh, don't worry, honey.

I'm here.

Oh.

You know, I really hope I die
next because the both of you

Are making me nauseous.

I'm getting out of here.

Move over, bimbo head.

Like, Warren's been missing
for quite some time now.

Maybe I should go
check on him alone

In the deep, dark
basement alone.

Like, you guys wait here.

Maybe I should go with you.

Like, why?

What could possibly happen?

Gee.

Warren!

Warren?

Warren, are you,
like, down here?

Warren, like, if this
is some kind of joke,

Like, it's not funny.

Warren?

Warren?

Is, like, that you behind the
slightly open door with light

Shining through and blood
all over the doorknob?

I think so.

Warren, like, if you're
trying to scare me, like,

It's totally not going to work.

Totally disgusting.

Grody.

Warren?

Everything's going to be OK.

We're going to get married.

We're going to have kids.

They're going to play football.

Where's Karen?

She's down in the basement
looking for Warren.

You let Karen go down
in the basement alone?

Why?

You think she needs our help?

Forget it.

She's already dead.


Sounds like she got
it in the throat.

Oh, who's doing this?

Bobby, what's going on?

Thank god the electricity
hasn't gone off.

Don't say that!

Oh, what are you, stupid?

What are you, crazy?

What are you, nuts?

Don't anybody mention the
doors being nailed shut.

[Hammers banging]

That's it.

We're all dead.

I'll probably go next.

Then you, Bobby.

Julie, it'll just be
you and the monster.

You'll run around the
house for a while.

You'll trip, sprain your
ankle, rub it till February.

Then you'll probably lean over.

He'll pop you in the eye
with a knitting needle.

The cops will show up.

You'll spend the rest of
your life in the crazy bin

With a severe case
of looney tunes.

But it's just one
guy against all us.

We can beat this guy.

Yeah.

Assuming the dead
don't reanimate.


Sorry.

Did you see that?

They just cut away.

We only have a few minutes left.

Well, I'm not going
to give up this easy.

I'm taking charge.

Oh, Bobby, what
are you going to do?

Yeah, Rambo, what now?

Tone, you take Julie.

Go to our bedroom.

I'll go to the kitchen.

I'll get some weapons,
knives, anything I can find.

Wait, wait wait.

You want me to take your
girlfriend up to your bedroom

When you go through the
kitchen to get knives?

Good plan.

Wait for me there.

Don't let anybody in
and lock the door.

Oh, Bobby, please be careful.

Oh, come on, honey.

I'll be all right.

Now go.

Oh.

Do you think he'll be OK?

Well, nope.

Huh?


This is simply awful.

This is terrible.

I hope Bobby's OK.

We're sup... oh, we're
supposed to be married.

What am I going
to tell my father?

Look.

What am I going to do?

If you were to think...
Maybe I'm nuts, all right?

Maybe I'm crazy.

But Bobby knew what
he was doing when he

Stayed down there, all right?

He's an asshole.

He's a shrimp boat.

He's a retard.

He's a moron.

He's a biscuit head.

You know what I'm saying?

No.

Look, the man knows
what he's doing.

He's a grown man.
Let him do it.

All right?

No, you don't understand.

What?

Well, Bobby and I never, well...

What?

You know.

What?

Well, you know.

Things that are yellow.

No.

Things that begin
with the letter L.

No.

We... we didn't...

Things that don't have
hair on their armpits.

No, Tony.

Things with sweaty...

Oh.

I don't want to die a virgin.


Let me get this straight.

Bobby bites it down
there in the basement.

Then it's just me and you left?

Yes.

I'll be right back.

Oh.


He's behind the couch.

Behind the couch.

Oh, don't act like
you wouldn't do it.

All right?


What am I, crazy?

Is he...

Oh, yes, he's very...

Oh.

There were too many of them.

They overpowered me.

I took out three of
them all by myself.

You know, Bobby... he
wasn't very strong.

But I did the best I could.

I did it for you, Julie.

How many are there?

Oh, everybody's dead, just
like I said it would happen.

They're all walking
around with a zombie look.

They're killing stuff
that ain't even alive.

It's un-fucking-believable.

Hey, look, it's just me and you.

We're the only ones left
with a few precious moments.

Oh, no.

Uh, listen, before Bobby
died, he said one thing.

What?

What did he say?

He said, Tony, do me a favor.

What am I, nuts?

He said that?

No.

He said, Tony, you
gotta do one thing.

Before I die, make
Julie a woman for me.

He said that?

Yes, he did.

Make sure you get a close up
of this because she's got a set

Of tits like you... Oh, god.

Oh.

Oh.

You sure you're a virgin?

Oh, wait a minute.
Wait.

Whoa.

What am I doing?

If I have sex, I'm gonna die.

If anybody has sex in these
movies, they always die.

It's a Hollywood law.

Tony, life is not a movie.

You think so?

Yes.

Fuck it.

Oh, wait a sec.
Wait a sec.

What?

You're in my light.

Oh.


Are you getting this?

This is un-fucking-believable.

Here, zoom in over
here one time.

And no pubic shots.

She's a good girl.

Yeah.

Oof.

Yeah.

Bark like a dog, you
four-legged bitch.


I'm doing this for you, Bobby.

Hey, I'm sure he
really appreciates it.

Could you move to the
left just a little bit?

Hey, could you guys
keep it down out there?

I can't concentrate.

Hey, come on, fellas.

Just give me five seconds.

Oh, come... I wouldn't
do this to you.

Oh, man.

Bobby.

Oh.

Oh, shit.

No.

No.

No, Bobby, no.

I didn't like it.

I didn't like it.

Bobby, no.


TONY: Watch the hair.

Forget it.

I'm already dead, you asshole.

There's no one left to kill.

Got any twos?

Go fish.

I knew this would happen.

What are you, stupid?

What are you, crazy?

What are you, a moron?

What are you, retarded?

Gee.

So what do you think, Doc, huh?

Am I crazy or what?

Well, I think you're on the
road to a speedy recovery.

You think so, Doc?

Well, sure.

I mean, it will take
years yet, of course.

You know, Doc, no one's
ever believed in me before.

DOCTOR: Tony, what
happened to your accent?

Tony?

Why are you calling me Tony?

My name is Ted Smith.

Yeah.

I'm Ted Smith.

No, it can't be.

Doc, I... I feel
like a new person.

You've... you've changed me.

I... how can I ever thank you?

You can't be cured.

My boats, the movies.


MS. PALNOR (ON PHONE):
Dr. Dollbrite, the members

Of the Academy are here.

I'll send them right in.

No, wait.

You don't know what you've done.
Maybe not.

But I know what
you've done for me.

You've freed me from
my mental prison.

I'm forever grateful.

No, don't you remember?

You were traumatized
when you were three.

Boo!

three years old.

You're going to the bathroom.

What do you see?

I see the man
that saved my life.

How could I ever repay you?

You're not listening.



What does that look like?

It looks like an ink blot.

It's a dick.

No, no.

You can't come in.

My patient has had a relapse.

He's incredibly violent.

Hello, gentlemen.

No.

He'll rip you to pieces.

He's got a gun.

Just like in the
movie, "Platoon."

Remember?

Remember?

Squirt, squirt, Roger.

Billy's behind you.

Get in the credenza.

TED: Isn't he marvelous?

Look, Lieutenant, they're
not wearing condoms.

Confiscate the evidence.

They want to be your friends.

That's it.

Just friends.

Just friends.

Dr. Dollbrite, it is indeed
a pleasure to meet you.

Indeed, you have a
most amazing patient.

I'm Dollbrite.

He's... he's Randy Roger Tony.

Tony, look.

They all look like dicks.

That's it.

They're all dicks.

Just dicks.

Just dicks.

He built a clock
out of a balloon

And half a pastrami sandwich.

We want to give you
this check for $1 million

To help further your research
in the pioneering study

Of schizophrenia.

We also want to
take your patient

With us for further research.

No.

That's my check.

I need it for socks.

Someday.

Someday, I'll have all
the socks in the world.


What am I, an asshole?

What am I, a scumbag?
