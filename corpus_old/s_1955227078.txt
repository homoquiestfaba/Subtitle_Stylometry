[Music playing]

Good evening, Herr Doctor.

Care to join me for a drink?

I would not stoop
so low as to drink

With you, Count Bloodspit.

You know what I find funny
about virgins, Herr Doctor?

At first, they don't go down
so well, but after a while,

The swallowing becomes easy.

The difference between
you and me, Herr Count,

Is while you find evil
amusing, I find it diabolical!

Oh, Doctor.

You were always so negative.

Why must you always
be so party pooper?

I think, Count Bloodsplit,
I will be the one

Having the party tonight.

Again, with the stake!

Goodbye.

[Thunder booming]

Oh, he won't get far.

He's not as young
as he used to be.

[Music playing]

Ah, Doctor.

You would've been here much
earlier in your younger days.

Oh, Count, in
your earlier days,

You would have been
in Paris by now.

Eh.

Paris is so boring, Herr
Doctor, not like your mother.

My mother?

You know what I like about
werewolves, Herr Doctor?

You can cut off their
heads and they'll

Grow back in five minutes.

Pity your mother
wasn't a werewolf.

That's it!

I will end this evil now.

[Theremin playing]


What you mortals do not
understand, Herr Doctor,

Is that you are not match for my
superior super natural powers.

Thank you.

However, if you did
want to defeat me,

You would have to take
the crest from my coffin

And stop me going back into
the mirror world to regenerate,

But that's not going to happen
now, is it, Herr Doctor?

By the way, how do
you like your steak?

[Blood squashing]

[Music playing]

I don't think we will ever
find Count Blaughspich, Doctor.

How many times have I told
you not to use this name?

It is Blaughspich!

He sucks the blood
from people and spits

Them out like an animal!

He's not to be referred
to by his real name!

But he has disappeared, Doctor.

He has vanished into the night
like... like those wretched

Souls that he has demonized.

Like... go on!

Say it!

Like... you know, like...

Like my mother!

Yes.

Yes, yes.

First he takes my legs,
then he takes my mother!

She loved that man.

He was her boyfriend!

No, no, Mr. Hansome.

He will not be far.

He cannot go back into the
mirror world without this crest

That we took from his coffin.

We desecrated his coffin.

He must have this crest to
get back to the mirror world!

The mirror world?

I do not understand, Doctor.

The mirror world is where
all the vampires come from.

That is why they cannot
see their reflection

In the mirrors!

I would like to see the
mirror world, Doctor.

Oh.

Would you like to see bad
breasts, fleshy thighs,

Und girly front bottoms?

Yes.

Then so be it!

We will go into the
mirror world, Mr. Hansome!


[Lighting cracking]

[Music playing]

[Cheerful music]

[Knocking on door]

The door!

Come in!

Herr Doctor!

Yes, yes.

What is it, inspector?

It's the
Burgermeister's daughter.

Oh, that whingeing bitch!

What does she want now?

No.

The other one.

Oh, it's the virgin?

Oh, I'll be right there.

First, Doctor, I beg of
you, please, some medicine.

Oh, yes.

I was just preparing
your take-aways.

[Music playing]

How long has she been like
this, Herr Burgermeister!

The bees!

They fucked me with
their sharp little cocks!

Daddy Daddy, I need stinky.

Aw!

Please, Doctor.

Help her.

Please, help her.

Like the filthy bee, I have
fucked flowers of nature, too.

The daffodil and the tulip.

The daisy and the rosebud.

And I have learned that the cock
of man cannot fuck with nature.

Yes!

We must take her temperature,
Herr Burgermeister.

Mr. Hansome?

Thank you.


Are you sure that is the way?

It seems unorthodox
to me, Herr Doctor.

Well, hands up anyone else
who went to medical school

In Hamburg!

Otto!

Come back, Otto!

Otto?

The mark of the vampire!

Surely, you don't
believe in vampires.

The wolfman, maybe.

The Frankenstein, of course.

But vampires?

I don't know what to believe
in anymore, Herr Burgermeister.

But there is one thing I
do believe me in, vampires!

[Music playing]

[Lighting cracking]

Do you know what she
did, your cunty daughter?

[Bat screeching]

Take something warm with you!

Fuck me, I have
seen better heads

At a zombie urine convention!

Sure Right.

As we all know, the Count
has had his coffin desecrated

And is suffering from
insomnia, which makes

Him one very grumpy crocodile.

Now I don't want any
of you, shitheads,

Annoying him in
anyway, or it will

Be night of the headless
vampires around here.


What the fuck are
you doing, lad?

I got naughty secrets.

When it comes to dick licking,
you're an idiot savant!

I hope you all haven't packed
your bags because the way

You've been behaving,
you won't be coming

Back with a [inaudible] will!

Yes.

What's... what's
under your dress?

It's not a fucking dress!

And if you have to
know, I'm free pushing!

That's right, lassie.

Six hundred year
old ginger pubes

Matted together with
dried, Scottish ball sweat.

And if that doesn't make your
fur burger weep, nothing will.

[Theremin playing]

Master?

Did you sleep well?

You... what are you doing here?

When [inaudible] the body,
mopped the coffin and ran

Round the castle into the trees.

Enough!

I don't like werewolves.

They are a lower breed.

They are dirty,
smelly creatures.

The only thing we have
in common with them

Is our love for the full moon.

Why do you think that is, huh?

My mommy has six titties.

That's it!

Someone has go to go!

I nominate Rufus because he
always hides in the toilet bowl

And tries to drink
my girly lemonade.

I nominate Dorian because
he's [inaudible] crawled down

My puppy hole and
laid eggs in it.

day, there was millions

Of buggers about his groan...


I nominate Rufus because
he's got bottom rabies

And he chewed up that... the good
book, "Big Boobied Homegirls.'"

Just open the fucking thing.

It's time to go Rufus.

[Scottish bagpipes playing]

Who wants hot chocolate
with marshmallows?

Ja!

Yeah!

We must hurry, Mr. Hansome.

If there's any chance of saving
the Burgermeister's daughter,

We must catch her before sun up!

It would be faster, Doctor,
if we took the hand break off.

The break never comes off!

[Music playing]

[Bell ringing]

Cleaning the toilet.

When you clean the
toilet, you must remember

To clean in an
anti-clockwise direction,

Ensuring that you get all of
the poo poos off of the bowl

And leaving behind very a large
quantity of smelly ammonia.

What to do if there is dick
dribble on the rim of the bowl.

Cut off dick.

Ah!

So you are the new maid?

Yes, Countess.

I have been here 120
years, come January.

You know Otto killed
the last maid we had.

She was my maid!

I don't like maids.

They go through my things
and steal all my clothes.

It wasn't me, it
was Dorian, I swear!

I bet your wearing my
underwear, you naught maid.

No.

No, Countess!

On your stomach!

No!

No, Countess!

Please, don't look
at mt fat ass!

Please, it's too big!

You know what happens to
maids who steal my underwear?

No!

Don't expose my shame!

Oh, I see what you mean.

You dirty, dirty maid!

Dirty, dirty maid!

Dirty!

Dirty, dirty maid!

Dirty maid!

Dirty, dirty maid!

Dirty!


Is my ass wobbling?

What's wrong, Master?

I'm dying.

I'm sick.

I'm sick, too, Master.

I was talking physically.

Is this about the
mirror world, Count?

Yes.

I need to go back into the
mirror world to regenerate.

Don't go!

To become young again.

Like puppies.

Tell us about the mirror world.

Please?

There's flesh.

Oh!

Naked flesh?

There's naked titties!

Oh!

Dirty!

And pussy!
Oh!

Stinky!

That's nice.

Stinky!

He's scaring me.

Shut up, doggie.

Little doggie!


Tell... tell us more
about the mirror world.

[Cheerful music]

More!

Please!


He blessed me with tummy cum!


Count?

Tell me... tell me again
about the mirror world.

Nothing you need to know about.


Master?

Your sister is awake.

Fuck!

And I'm not cleaning that up.

I'll clean it up.


[Music playing]

went up the water spout.

Down came the rain and
washed the spider out.

Out came the sun and dried up
all the rain and itsy bitsy

Spider never came out again.

Come in!

Come in!

Come in!

Come in, you're...
You're breaking up!

You're breaking up!

Come in!

[Radio static]

In transmission.

Wake up, Doctor!

Wake up, Doctor!

No, master, no!


Where am I?

You missed it!

You missed it!

Missed what?

[Ice cream truck music]

When you fell over, Doctor,
I carried you up the stairs

And I noticed there was
some people in the bushes.

They were fondling each other.

At first, I did not want to
see... want to look at them,

But I was drawn to
their sick love!

It reminded me of
my school days.

I didn't know you went
to school, Mr. Hansome.

Yes, I won a javelin
throwing scholarship.

And while I was there, I had
a liaison with a older woman.

I don't think I can
go again, Bedelia.

10 times is enough.

Oh.

But I think I can make
you go again, my dear.

[Circus music]

Now I'm ready!

Enough, Mr. Hansome!

We must continue.

By now, the Count
will have surrounded

Himself with intelligent
killers that will stop nothing!

We must go!

Now!

[Crow squawking]

[Music playing]

Ah!

You're awake, my dear.

My, my, Otto.

Aren't we looking handsome?

You look so juicy, my dear.

How long have I
been asleep, Otto?

Oh, 200 years, or so.

200 years!

But you looked so
beautiful asleep, my dear!

You had that dead
quality about you.

And where is my handmaiden?

She uh... she met with an
unsavory accident, my dear.


Give me what I need, Otto!

[Music playing]

Give me what I need, Otto!

Otto, give me what I need!

Give it to me!

Darling, give me what I need!

[Music playing]

But why are we here, Doctor?

The Count is no
ordinary vampire.

No ordinary?

No.

We need help to fulfill my
quest to kill the Count.

How will we be killing him?

We must seek advice from
my old school professor.

I'd like to meet the old...

No!

He does not like strangers.

I must go in by myself.

Otto?

Wake up, darling!

Otto?

Otto, I want to play.

Wake up!

What!

What are you doing?

I want to play, darling.

I'm busy.

What are you doing?

I'm thinking!

Otto, you took my
handmaid and I need

Somebody else to play with.

Dorian!

So, darling, can you tell me
what my dear brother has been

Up to while I've been asleep.

Well, he made a monster, and
it played mommy bounce with me,

And then it's thing
fell off, and it died.

Oh, poor baby.

But the Count blamed me.

And he beat me with a stick.

But that's not the worst of it.

He's been flesh worshipping,
and playing with cheerleaders,

And he squandered
the family fortune.

The Doctor's been
chasing the Count,

And destroyed the
Count's coffin,

And now he can't be resurrected.

Now... now he must go back
into the mirror world.

Interesting.

But I must say, your
flesh is very soft.

And your legs!

Your legs are like
highways to heaven.

The gates of heaven.

Little doors, little doors!

Open up little doors!

Let Dorian in!

Is it clockwise,
or anti-clockwise?

Hmmm.

DORIAN: No, Countess!

I'm sorry, Countess.

I didn't mean to touch
your stick stuff.

You mean my cunt.

You think I'd let a
peasant like you fuck me?

[Drill spinning]

I do the fucking around here.

[Drill spinning]

No, Countess!

No!

[Drill spinning]

No, Countess!

No!

Countess!

[Drill spinning]


[Music playing]

How long will the professor be?

The professor won't
be long, Doctor.

Good.

I had a patient,
a man in wheels.

Good.

Good.

I used to have to
loofah his body.

Good.

I think it's essential.

Only, he had a rather
stinky little doctor.

No.

When I was in medical
school with the professor,

We specialized in organs.

We were the envy
of all of Hamburg.

For a time.

Do you like my organs?

Well...

Doctor?

Indeed, but only from a
mental standpoint, of course.

Lovely blanket you
have there, Doctor.

My mother knitted this blanket.

She knitted it from the wool
from my pet lamb, Herman.

Herman?

And what happened top to
little Herman, Doctor?

Well, very sad.

Herman... we had to eat
Herman for Christmas.

We were very poor,
my mother and I.

Did you eat even the organs?

There was some
potatoes, too, I think.

Potatoes?

Yes.

Doctor.

Yes?

Getting a little
hot, are we, Doctor?

Well, I am a professional.

I'm used to...


Would you like some
of my organs, Doctor?


It's getting
rather hot in here.

Yes!

Yes!

Oh!

Professor, the Doctor's
here to see you.

What are you doing here?

I was... I was your...
Your favorite pupil

In medical school in Hamburg.

Doctor...

Uh, yes!

My... we... we were both
thrown at the same time.

Oh, yes.

Oh, of course.

Well, I remember.

I was... you were there?

Yes, of course.
Of course.

We... we were the ones...

In the early... in the early
days of the great experiment.

It would have changed
the world, if they only

Had let us, Herr Professor.

Ah, yes.

What a great challenge
to our intelligence.

What a great leap forward from
the syphilis to the phallus.

The phallus and the syphilis.

The... the... the putting
the brain in the penis.

But anyway, yes.

But I... Of course, I have
continued with my experiments.

I can see you're
very busy, Professor.

In fact, I have done
something to myself,

Which anyone could do in
the privacy of their home!

What's that?

I have inserted a
brain into my scrotum!

Of course!

Of course!
That's...

Why didn't we think
of that before?

Genius, Herr Professor.

Genius.

I have to work.

You know, I am a very busy man.

What do you want?
Oh, yes.

Yes.

Uh... I am here for your advice.

You need help?

I can see you need help!

Nurse Balloon!

Bring some legs!

We will have you
walking in no time!

Nurse Balloons!

Nurse!

Where is that woman?

Nurse?

Ah!

Yes, Professor?

Nurse, we... we need
some legs for the Doctor.

No, no.

No, Herr Professor.

It is not... it's not the legs.

You see these?

You know what they're full of?

Brains!

Yes.

Oh!

Thank you, Professor.

Oh, yes.

Don't mention it.

Oh, you can mention it.

Yes, so?

Oh, yes.

The evil... the evil
Count Von Blaughspich,

He... he's a vampire,
Herr Professor.

A vampire?

A vampire, yes!

Yes!

A blood sucking freak!

I have the ancient text.

Oh, please.

Please, help me!

It should have something of
the story of this evil, wicked,

And very nasty, nasty monsters.

But what is needed, is surprise
with this wooden banana...

Of course!

And this tool!

And the crest!

Oh, Professor.

This is so simple.

The stake goes through the
crest and then into his heart!

Boom!
Boom!

Boom!

There!

Of course!

Of course.

He will never suspect!

Is there anything I can do
to repay you, Herr Professor?

Yes.

Yes.

In the name of science, I want
you to give me your gonads.

[Scottish bagpipes playing]

B-A-Y!

B-A-Y-C-H-E-Y [singing]

[Scottish bagpipes playing]

Oh, shit.

Oh, very nice, Angus.

I never realized you
were such a sissy.

Keep your insults
to yourself, lassie.

I'm all man and don't make
me life my dress to prove it!

Mind if I sit down?

It's your ass.

You can inject it with
monkey pocks, for all I care!

Angus, darling, how long
have you known my brother for?

You know very well how long.

I've been asleep 200
years, I don't know

What dimension I'm in anymore!

It was after some
fucking medieval war

In the 15th Century.

I was rendered with amnesia.

I didn't know who I
was, or where I was.

I was walking along this
road through the mist.

I see this castle
up ahead of me.

It lights up in the dark.

And I approached up to the door,
opened the door... you wouldn't

Believe what I've seen.


[Scottish bagpipes playing]


I like him.

What do you think, my dear?

He's... he's OK.

I think I'll keep him.

Go and give him eternal life.

That was 600 years
ago and I've never

Regretted a century of it.

The Count is like
a brother to me.

So do you trust
my brother, Otto?

ANGUS: Aye.

Would you give
your life for him?

ANGUS: Aye.

Would you take a knife and slit
your own man ovaries for him?

Let's not get nuts here.

It's a shame, what happened
to the family crest.

A shame

Ai.

It is.

Well, it's strange,
don't you think?

ANGUS: Strange?

In what way?

Well, those idiots downstairs
told me that Otto was away

And you were in
charge of his coffin.

Ai.

That's right.

So how did the
Doctor and his peasant

Get past such a big,
strong man like you?

What are you suggesting, woman?

That I let them in?

Don't be defensive, darling.

I'm just curious.

One night, while I was
polishing the coffin,

They snuck up behind me and shot
me in the heart with a crossbow

From behind the door!

And they ripped off
the lock and did their

Filthy, clandestine maneuvers.

They ripped off the lock?

Ai.

With a crowbar the size of
an elephants nether trunk!

You mean, this little thing?

Ai.

One that looks like that
one, but not that one.

Angus, I know every little
bat dropping in this castle.

You don't think I know
the lock, the protector

Of my brother's coffin chamber?

Mmm.

Maybe I'm wrong.

Maybe I should go and
see Otto about this, eh?

Wait!

Where did you get it?

That idiot, Rufus, dug
it up from round the back.

The nerve of that
dirty commoner!

He proposed to me.

Wanted to use it as
an engagement ring!

Oh, there, there, darling!

Tell mommy.

Tell mommy everything.

The Count had been
gone for five days.

I started to get bored!

Oh.

I thought you might
be hungry, Angus.

Ai.

I am!

Set it over there for me.

[Circus music]

Tell me about the circus, mama!

There are acrobats, and
midgets, and lions in cages,

And clowns!

No clowns!

No clowns!

No clowns!

This is a very momentous
occasion, Mr. Hansome.

I've been waiting for
this for over 10 years!

Once we take the crest
from the Count's coffin,

He will not be able to
return to the mirror world

And we will defeat his evil!

Now stick it in!

Stick it in?

Stick it in!

Stick it in!

DOCTOR: Get it off!

Get it off?

DOCTOR: Get it off?

MR. HANSOME: Get it off?

DOCTOR: Oh, focus!

Let me do it!

Good job, Mr. Hansome.

Now we must go
before they see us!

No!

Are you sure this
is going to work?

Just tell Master you got shot
in the heart with wooden arrow

And then they broke
open the lock!


Go and bury this where
no one will find it.

Where no one will find it!

Understand?

[Music playing]


Poor, Otto.

He's so sick.

Someone should put
him out of his misery.

Come on, we have work to do.

[Jewelry box music playing]

Oh, just one more
time, Miss Lily?

No!

Please?

No!

Just one more time, please?
No!

No more.

All finished for now.

Dorian?

Yes, Miss Lily?

May I ask you something?

Oh, yes, Miss Lily.

Do you think I have a fat ass?

Can I touch it?

No!

Again, do you think I would
look nice with breasts?

But... but your
boobies, Miss Lily?

What about them?

They're so big and juicy.

Juicy, huh?

You like my boobies?

Oh, very nice.

You would like to have
some just like mine to hold?

Oh... oh, yes.

Touch touch?

And to rub.

Oh, yes.

It will never happen.

They're too perfect.

You could never have
breasts like mine.

Do you know, Dorian,
what I like to do

Late at night in my coffin,
before the sun rises?

What?

I like to touch my nipples.

But you don't

Why don't you listen
to the lovely music.

[Jewelry box music playing]

You know, Mr. Hansome, looking
up at these stars reminds of...

What?

My mother.

She was so dedicated to hygiene.

Mother wants to
play slippery seals.

This is the hoop.

In the hoop it goes.

Bad boy!

You filthy seal!

Yes, you are mother's!

You are mother's boy!

In the through hoop,
you filthy seal!

In through the hoop!

Dirty seal!

You dirty boy!

Yes!

Mommy's!

Yes, mommy's seal!

[Seal sounds]

Yes!

Yes, yes, you filthy boy!

[Seal sounds]

And don't let me catch
you idiots doing it again!

Oh, Master.

Baby wants to play with
those toilet titties!

Where are you talking the tray?

Um, I'm talking it to your
younger sister, Bloodvena.

She's awake.

Bloodvena's awake?

Yes, Master.

I was just taking her
this light refreshment.

Why don't you rest your
pretty, little, stinky feet.

Let me take this to Bloodvena.

Goodbye.

Yes, Master.

[Music playing]

So, Bloodvena, my dear, do you
like the tea Otto made for you?

Yes, Otto, but I see
danger in the tea leaves.

Yes, Bloodvena.

You were always
the most beautiful

And the most intelligent.

You are right.

There is danger.

But anyway, how have you been
keeping yourself, my dear?

Oh, you know,
terrorizing orphans,

Looking for virgins, the usual.

But I'm bored, Otto.

When can we go back
to the mirror world?

Unless we get the
crest from the doctor,

We shall never see the
mirror world again?

The doctor?

Is that the funny little
man in the wheelchair?

I don't think it will be very
difficult to get rid of him.

Ah, so you know
the doctor, my dear?

Well, that's only
half our troubles.

That bitch sister
of ours is awake

And she's trying to
claim half the castle.

But she can't do that,
Otto, because I own a third.

Oh, that's right.

I forgot.

I'll take care
of the doctor, you

Take care of that old bitch.

Together, Otto.

Together, my dear.

[Electric waves]

Sing Twinkle for me.

twinkle little star...

Who's the star?

You are the star, my Count.

Sing!

wonder where you are...

It's not where you are,
it's what you are, you idiot!

I'm sorry, my Count.

wonder what you are...

Silence!

THE COUNTESS: Otto?

What do you want?

Does this belong to you?


No!

It doesn't belong to me.

Now get it out of here,
you filthy, dirty thing!

Smells like mommy's pissy tits.

Go!

You, sing!

Yes, Count.

the world so high...

(SINGING IN UNISON) Like
a diamond in the sky.

twinkle little star...


wonder what you are.

[Music playing]

I'm mature.

You call that mature?

Mmm.

You're a real hot doggy.



[Music - "here comes the bride"]

And that is what
love is all about!

[Theremin playing]

Who is it, Herr Doctor?

It is the youngest of
the Count's sisters.

Be careful, Mr. Hansome, she
has the power of hypnosis.

Only the untrained and idiots
will fall into her spell!

[Sound of stabbing]

Are you sure we
should be doing this?

Of course, we should!

Besides, I have a
little present for you.

I heard that you, uh... you have
trouble turning into a bat?

Well, I have news for you.

Fly-fucking-agra?

I don't need Flyagra tablets!

I can turn into a
bat any time I like.

I can turn into a
bat six times in one

Fucking night, if I choose to!

Fly-fucking-agra, you
skanky, fucking twat!

Darling, let's feed Otto.

[Theremin playing]

So to what do I
owe this pleasure?

Oh, Otto, darling,
you're looking so weak.

I've made a little food for you.

Food, my dear?

Made by your own hands?

All by myself, Otto.

With no one watching?

Well, uh... Angus, he
maybe watched a little?

I was watching.

Ah, so Angus was watching
you make the food, huh?

Oh, how very sweet.

Well, if Angus was
there, I guess it's OK.

Let's see.

Uh, uh, uh.

Angus first.

Oh.

I couldn't possibly fit
another thing in me.

Just one spoonful!

That's it.

Open up.

The little train is coming.

Oh!

Here comes the choo-choo train!

Choo!

Choo-choo!

Choo-choo!

You tried to poison me, huh?

You fucking cunt!

I will break your skinny,
little chicken neck!

But I promised daddy I wouldn't.

[Crashing sound]

I'll get you for this, Otto.

You!

I expected better from you.

Master, I have a
confession to make.

I'm the reason the crest
was stolen from your coffin.

Oh, I know.

Lily told me the day I got back.

Now I want you to get all
those idiots together.

Go downstairs.

We are having a meeting.

We are getting rid of
that cunt of a sister

Of mine once and for all.

She... she stuck that big noisy
thing up my... my butt pocket.

She spanked my ass so hard,
it was red raw for a week.

She tried to blackmail me
and I found her farting around

With my [inaudible] collection.

She tried to poison me.

My own sister.

She cut off my
puppy [inaudible].

Oh, we're having a
little meeting, are we?

What are we talking about?

We were just discussing...

Where to go to
get a bite to eat.

Yes, my dear.

Oh, goody!

I'll get changed!

See you then!

Lily?

Yes, Master?

Meet me upstairs
in five minutes.

These are the ruins of the
Counts old castle, Mr. Hansome.

What happened to
it, Herr Doctor?

It was five years ago
today, I followed him here,

To his castle full of freaks.

And with a wave
of his hand, he of

Destroyed the whole place, like
a temperamental child kicking

Over his building blocks.

But fear not, Mr. Hansome.

He does not possess
these Same powers.

He has been too long
without his crest.

Mmm.

I, too, once had building
blocks, Herr Doctor.

Look!

[Bell ringing]

MR. HANSOME: Who are
they, Herr Doctor?

They are the sisters of
sorrow from the mirror world!

But Doctor, how can they
survive the sunlight?

Ah!

They are merely an
illusion, a reflection

From the twisted bowels
of the mirror world.

But they do have the
power of a zompires!

Zompires, Herr Doctor?

Ah, yes, Mr. Hansome.

The unholy union between
the vampire and the zombie.

Hurry, Mr. Hansome!

We must kill them!

With this?

No, Mr. Hansome!

They must be dismembered.

Use this.

I will wait here, Mr. Hansome.

I will be judging you
on grace and poise.

[Chainsaw buzzing]

More throttle!

Chop!

Chop!

Chop!

[Bell ringing]

[Music playing]

Such an amateur display
of tactics, Dr. Ludwig.

How pathetic.

Even your tires are flat.

Well, let us look at the
score board, shall we?

I think it is three nil, my way.

You will have to play
much better than that

Against the Count, Doctor.

Bring it, bitch!

In fact, I was going
there right now!

Then we will see what is what!

Well, I shall see
you soon, Doctor!

Not if I see you first.

Doctor!

What?

I liked the one on the left.


It's the scent of
stinky maid milk that

Gets my squirt sacks rumbling!

There is nothing better
than upside down sex.

I don't know.

I think maybe doggy style...
I like doggy style, Master.

It's nice.

You know, on all
fours, like a dog.

It's cool, you know.

I don't like dogs.

I don't like bum sex,
but I like bum nuts.

Woof!

Woof!

[Toilet flushing]

Lily?

Yes, Master?

I have a plan to get rid of
that cunt of a sister of mine.

What's the plan, Master?

Well, first, you
stay here and...

Yes.

Yes, Master!

And last of all...


Yes, Master!

Master?

Master?

Cunt.

Men.

So Otto wishes to eat
out tonight, does he?

This could be his last supper!

Are you sure no one
lives in this house?

I'm sure.

Do you think we'd be going
in, if anyone lived there?

Let's go.

Did she die in the house?

Oh, for fuck's sake, Annie!
Just get in there.

Let's go!

Well, did she, Rodney?

What are you talking about?

Did the old lady
die in this house?

Look, all I know is there was
a big scream and by the time

They knocked the
door down and got in,

There was just a pool of blood
and a lady's in the middle.

Come on, Rodney.

Can we go to McDonald's now?

Get fucked, man.

He's just shitting us.

We'll have a smoke
first, then we'll go.

Shit!

I forgot the matches.

Could I offer you a light?

[Thunder booming]

Oh, so tasty and young!

You are exactly what I need!

Oh, such a pretty, pretty boy.

Care for a suck?

Yes.


Tastes like young [inaudible].

[Music playing]

Oh, you're all...
You're all naked!

You look sexy!

Oh, thank you.

I feel sexy.


I'm coming!

I'm coming!

Coming!


Look, Mr. Hansome!

There's one of the
Count's vampires!

Quickly!

Use this!

[Music playing]

No!

Good shooting, Mr. Hansome!

I'm not afraid to die!

I've had a good life and
I've had a lot of great cunt!

Fair ones, hairy ones,
trimmed ones, baldies,

And my favorite, stinky pies!

No!

No!

OK.

[Scottish bagpipes playing]

Don't... Don't worry
about him, we have to go!

[Thunder booming]

[Music playing]

Come, Mr. Hansome.

We must go and find the Count!

But careful, we must go into
the room full of crystals.

Don't touch anything!

Oh, Countess!

That was so fantastic.

You are the most beautiful,
the most sensual,

The most erotic dead
woman I have ever known.

Tell me something I
don't know, darling.

[Crashing sound]

What was that?

It's the doctor.

Countess, quickly!

You must leave!

You must leave now!

You turn into a bat.

It's the only way to
save yourself, go!

Quickly!

What about Otto?

It's probably already
too late for him.

Quickly, go!

You must leave now!

Turn into a bat and fly away!

Don't worry about me.

You think I'm
worried about you?

[Bell ringing]

[Evil laughter]

Goddamn, fucking, old whore!

I'll fucking teach you to
spank me, you evil little cunt!

[Squashing sound]

Master, I've done what you said.

Your sister is dead.

Ah, good work, Lily.

Now I have to go back into the
mirror world to regenerate.

But I can't risk taking you with
me, but I will be back for you.

I promise.

Now you know what we have to do.

Yes, Master.

Goodnight.

[Cracking sound]

I think, Mr. Hansome, we
have found his special room.

Ah, ja, Doctor.

Special?

[Music playing]

This... this will be the
last day of your life!

We are here to do business,
not your filthy, dirty things!

COUNT BLAUGHSPICH:
Where is the crest?

Oh, yes, Count.

Despite all your theatrics,
I still have this!

It's beautiful, Doctor.

The mirror world?

I should like to go back there.

Come!

That's it!

Closer!

Closer!

[Ray buzzing]

You!

Peasant Boy!

You promised me a virgin!

But I did bring a virgin!

Here is your virgin.

A mommy's boy virgin,
are you, Doctor?

Never mind.

I just booked myself a ticket
back to the mirror world.

Passenger!
