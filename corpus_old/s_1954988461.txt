Hi, my name is Mickey Hauser.

And I'm the chief spokesman
for the clarity Clara

Clean corporation.


I'm here today to tell
you about an exciting new

Development, that's sure
to knock your socks off.

Our scientists have been
toiling away in the laboratory,

Concocting a product
that'll help you

Hardworking folks at home,
in ways you never dreamed of.

It's called ClarActix!,
and it's going

To be your number one
cleaning system solution.

Now I know you folks at
home or in the office,

Want to spend more time with
your work or with the kids.

And that's why we've
employed the active cleansing

Ingredients of the chemical
compound, trithorazexamine,

Whose capabilities are no
less than modern magic.

Holy smokes, look at
the mess we've got here.

Let's give it a try, shall we?


I can barely see through all
these residue and buildup.

All I do is spray it on.

Trithorazexamine cuts
into grime like a knife,

Dissolving the bonds
between the molecules.

There.

Isn't that better?

[RADIO NEWS]

(RADIO VOICE) Getting
across the Hudson

This morning is a mess.

We have about a 45 minute
delay at the Holland Tunnel;

30 minutes, low level GW bridge;
one hour on the upper level.

Early gains on Wall
Street have all but

Evaporated in Monday's
African trading.

As investors eye new bred
marketing developments

And the latest
corporate records.

Oil prices this year
are at record highs.

Dow Jones industrial
average up 35 points.

[RADIO INTERRUPTION]

(RADIO VOICE DISTORTED) Clara
Clean corporation is rumored

To be considering
massive lay offs

In the manufacturing divisions.

Public face and
spokesman, Mickey Hauser,

Nearly a decade ago.

In weather news, a heat wave
that is pounding the west coast

This past week, is making
its way across the country.

[RADIO INTERRUPTION]

[ALARM CLOCK]

(RADIO VOICE) It's mid
afternoon in midtown Manhattan.

The heat index is at
about five degrees,

At a sweltering 70
percent humidity.

Winds crawling along at about
two or three miles per hour.

It's all going to contribute
to that stifling feeling...

Young children, senior citizens,
and anyone with breathing

Problems, such as
asthma, emphysema,

Should stay inside
as much as possible.

With windows and doors closed,
and keep your ACs on high.

We're looking at a
red hot afternoon

Today in New York City.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is terrific.

This is really good.

This is something different.

Um.

Yeah, I mean, it's a little,
it's a little too green.

This too, this is amazing.

Yeah, I think so.

Yeah, this has a lot of
spirit to it, you know?

This is great.

This is great.

I like the salmon tones
in the background, there.

This tree is really
interesting too.

I mean, I'm pretty enthusiastic
about this picture.

I'm pretty enthusiastic
about this picture.

OK.

I like it.

I like it a lot.

I don't think we can use it.

But I like it, OK?

OK, let's go to the next one.

This, this is wonderful.

I mean, I mean,
this kind of fog.

And the fog
collects in the back.

Yeah.

I see what your... I see where
you're going with this one.

But it makes it look like
it's almost out of focus.

I don't think...
I... I... I get it.

I don't think, I don't
think everybody will.

This is not so good.

Um, it's kind of a mess.

What else do you have?

This too, is excellent.

It's too bad it's not in focus.

So more stuff like this, in
focus, and not as shitty,

Would be great.

No, I don't like this.

What else do you have?

That's it.

That's it?

That's all you could find?

In one hour?

Yeah.

I mean, it's not easy
to find high rez,

Unbranded images in an hour.

Sure it is.

Well, it's not easy to find
ones that you're going to like.


Leaky ceilings, rotting
beams, lead paint lace growing

In the backyard, that you can't
eat without getting poisoning.

You know what I want?

I want like a nice
fucking arcade room,

A Foosball table...
That's what I want.

I don't want to hang out
in a shit hole anymore.

This one's your
boyfriend's firm.

They're just starting out.


One week.

That's how long we've got
to get this pitch together.

One week.

OK.

Kimble, I think you're having
a hard time understanding

That, uh, this has
to be fantastic.

OK.

When I say fantastic,
I mean, fantastic.

[BREATHING HEAVY] Fantastic.

Fantastic.

It really has to be fantastic.

They'll only have a week
to put this together.

If it turns out to be
anything less than fantastic,

I'm going to remember who has
brought this to my attention.

Doug?

I don't like any of these.

OK.

We need something new.

OK, um, we've exhausted
the possibilities

With the Energy Counts
Services, have we not?

Maybe we could go on a trip.

To where?

I just think, I just think
we need our own pictures.

I mean, finding them.

Yeah.

Yeah, bro.

What're you guys talking about?

I got an idea.

We're going to go camping.

I was just saying
to Doug, I... I

Think that the stock
photography, these database

Images we're working with are
trying too hard to capture

The over... the overall
image of the woods.

We need pictures
that work for us.

Yeah, I was thinking maybe...
Maybe the key is kind of,

Let's get it, let's get
specific about it, OK?

Go into the individual
aspect of the forest.

Yes.

The little details
of the forest.

The mushrooms, there are
acorns, there's squirrels.

You know, I was
thinking, what about

Looking at systems
on a smaller level?

That's great.

Yeah, it's perfect.

It's great.

Like mushrooms,
flowers, green, moss...

That's great.
That's great.

I love that.

And actually...

Really do...

Listen, what
you're trying to say

Is that we need to align
the photographic vision

Of this project, with
the vision of our pitch.

Well, yeah.
And what is our pitch about?

What is our pitch about?

Go...
Well, that's what I saying.

Go.

Tell me, what is it about?

Our pitch is about tranquility.

No.

Our pitch is about peace.

No.

Our pitch is most
importantly I think,

I think, it's about clarity.

I mean... And...

I mean, themes could
emerge naturally...

These pictures...

From the, whatever
we, we chose to...

These pictures,
they aren't clear.

We found those through Quark.

These pictures don't align.

So we need better pictures?

That we know that we can use!

Right!

So, more aligned...

With the clarity of our pitch.

Yes.

All right, we're
going to do this.

Uh, you and me, we're
going to take pictures.

You're gonna write copy.

Excellent fucking
idea, Richards.

Here, give it to me.

Total fucking immersion, bro.

All right.

I'm gonna get the car.

You guy get the gear.

And then we're gonna go.

OK?

It's our first... yeah,
it's our first major job.

I'm really, uh, I'm
really excited about it.

I don't know when
I'm getting paid, OK?

I don't know.

OK, I know.

I know.

Well, we have to pay our dues.

What was that?

A car just went past.

I couldn't... I didn't
hear you, it was a truck.

Oh, yeah.

Well, I'm gonna have
it finished real soon.

I just have to finish up
a couple of, more details.

It's coming along great.

OK, Dad, OK.

I'll talk to you soon.

Yeah, I love you, Dad.

Bye.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Yeah, we're going to
be there in a few hours.

Hey, roll up the fucking window.

Sorry, what was that?

Oh.

Oh.

Yeah, I'll tell Ben.

Really?

Oh.

OK.

Well, I'll call you
when we get there.

Bye.

Who was that?

That was Ivan.

He's, uh, very excited
that we're coming.

And he's planning a barbecue.

I love barbecues.

You've met him
before, Ben, right?

What does he do?

Nothing.

He's going to be an
engineer, but uh... what?

Well, he just what, sits
around, cooking barbecues?

Yes, it's a shame.

What're you
supposed to tell me?

Uh.

Tell me.

I can't tell you.

Why not?

Because you wouldn't let
me touch your mustache.

Please tell me.

But it's so beautiful, Ben.

Chow down.

But it's so beautiful.

Yeah, it's sweet, ain't it?

It's so soft,
it's a special one.

All right.

All right!

What did he say?

What's that?

Tell you what?

What did he say?

All right, it's
his special guest.

So just file that away
in your mystery file.

Who?

Maybe it's question mark?

It could be anyone.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

Hey Sonia, do you get
reception out here?

Yeah, I guess we're kind
of out of range, huh?

You know, I think I can, uh,
get a signal if I hold it

Up like that, and use a headset.

You can use it
any time you want.

Just ask.

Hey Doug!

Doug!

Come help me get some fire wood.

[CAMERA BEEPING]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

[WHISTLING MELODY]

Uh, I'm going to go
help Sunny with the tent.

K, will uh, Ivan and everybody
know where to find us?

Yeah, I mean, they're
from around here.

Cool.

You know what to
look for, right?

Yeah, sure.

You want something that's dry.

Not uh, alive, because
it's wet in the middle.

Maybe get some logs
for, for later.

Hey, is your girlfriend
going to be all right?

Because you know, she can't
use her PDA or whatever.

She's fine.

Uh huh.

I mean, I could handle it.

I'm just saying.

We, you know... we have
a, we have a, you know...

We have a process for...

I was just thinking,
like out here,

She's not just your girlfriend.

Yeah.

No, I uh...

So you know?

Yeah, I know.

OK, great.

Keep it up, man.


Piece of shit.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

[CAMERA BEEPING]

Hey.

Give me a hand.

Hey.

Hey.

You getting some
good shots, man?

I got a few.

Yeah?

I think we're going to kill.

What?

The bitch.

It's gonna fucking kill.

Yeah, I hope so.

Hey.

I trust your eyes, Ben.

Thanks, Doug.

You're welcome.

Kimble's going to put your
uh, shit in his layout

While we're out here.

I thought he was
just doing copy.

No.

We brought all this gear.

We're gonna do this right.

Makes sense.

I got an idea.

The shots you were
just taking, give those

To him when we get back to camp.

Um...
Can I look at some of them?

I'm going to get
some better ones later.

Can I see what you've got?

No, I'm going to
get some better ones.

All right.

Hey, uh, you didn't
get any fire wood.

[DISTANT CHATTER AND ACOUSTIC
GUITAR STRUMMING]

over my head comes down...

With the light in the
mouth of your soul.

Do you know any
of these people?

A few of them.

I used to come down here
with Kimble on breaks.

What are they doing?

Singing?

I guess.

What?

Um, it sucks.

Well, I think they're kind
of going for a revival thing.

He looks like a clown.

Shut up.

What?

Who's that?

Summer Day.

What?

That's her name.

That's her name, Summer Day?

Her parents are hippies.

She's kind of a hippie
too, don't you think?

Yeah.

Hot, though.

You fuck her?

No.

Did you try?

Mm hm.

Not hard enough
though, obviously.

She had a boyfriend.

So?

Did she want you?

Yeah, you did.

Yeah, she did.

Does she have a boyfriend now?

I don't know.

Does it matter?

Shut up.

It doesn't.

Ben, serious, I'll tell
you what you should do.

All right, go over there,
with your uh, sexy mustache

And cigarette a-dangling.

Go over there, in the
direction of Summer Day.

And just put your
arm around her.

You don't even have
to introduce yourself.

Just... just do it.

She knows who you are.

Pretty soon, uh, we got a
couple of cuddle bunnies

In the corner of the party.

Step two, take her
out in the woods.

Mm.

Find a nice little path.

Let her lead, though.

It's kind of creepy...
Which is better.

Because then when you don't
murder her, it'll build trust.

All right, so find a nice
spot out in the woods.

And start kissing on her.

You which part to kiss?

The base of her neck.

You know why?

That's where they
got the peach fuzz.

And at this moment,
you should run

Your hand real
slowly up her thigh.

Underneath her dress.

Just take your
hands, and just kind

Of shove it up into her asshole.

Sort of like the
birth of a dinosaur,

Like, ooh, twist it
in and out like that.

I swear to god she'll
poo like a pigeon.

It's not a joke.

It works every time,
I guarantee you.

Go try it.

Yeah, OK.

You going?

Yeah, I'm gonna go...

All right.

Get her.

I wanna hear about it.

I'll do something else.

Richards, hey...
[MIMICS BIRD NOISE]

[MUSIC PLAYING]



[BREATHING HEAVY]

I think these are yours.

Yeah, you're going to
have to let that go.

That was... thank you.

If you wanted to, maybe you
could stay the weekend with us?

If you don't have plans.

You know... you know
what we should do?

What?

We should go swimming tomorrow.

You want to go
swimming tomorrow?

There's... I know a place.

We'll go.

Tomorrow, OK?

Yeah?

OK.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Because when we build change,
and we don't... you know,

When we discussed it.

Why?

Because you know,
we work on things,

You know, we'll improve it...
We'll work on it together.

So that's...

I think you've worked
enough on your own

To know what works
and what doesn't.

Well, I mean... you know,
let me show to Doug.

I think you're
better than Doug.

And I think you're
better than Richards.

Hey.

How'd it go?

What?

Last night.

Oh, it went great.

You didn't fuck her, did you?

No, I mean, we had a,
we had a great time.

Great time?

Yeah.

You do what I said?

Yeah.

I put my arm around her and
tried not to say anything...

No, that's not what
I'm talking about.

Yeah.

Maybe later, Doug.

Hey, Ben.

What?

You're gonna swim
with your glasses on?

Uh, I guess not.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

I can't see anything.

The sun is too fucking bright.

Sonia?

How are you doing?


You doing OK?


OK.

You can tell me if
anything's bothering you.

Is anything bothering you?

No.

OK.

So after I get
back from Indiana,

I'm going over to backpack
in Europe for a couple months

With a friend of mine,
who's been doing work

With refugees from Afghanistan.

Wow.

So it's going to be amazing.

Yeah.

And then when I get back, I
don't know... I had this plan

To set up, like
this after school

Music program in
low-income areas.

Maybe in um, Boston or New York.

I'm really hoping
for Boston though,

Because I've never been there.

But I've heard it's
really beautiful.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Cool.

Uh, but I hear it's
hard to park in Boston.

Which might be a problem.

But, but maybe that
means there's less cars.

So that's a good thing.

No cars is good.

What about you though?

You... it seems like your
business is going really well.

I keep hearing really
good things about it.

Yeah.

I mean, advertising isn't
really my thing, exactly.

But...

Really?

Yeah.

Whats, what's your thing?

Um, um, well, I've
been painting recently.

Really?

That's awesome.

Like um, abstract stuff?

Or Cubist?

Um, more like portraits.

Oh.

I'm working on this
portrait of my dad.

Uh huh.

I'm really struggling
with it actually.

Like with the face.

Like, like the nose and
the eyes, or something?

It's more like, I can't,
I can't see it properly.

If that makes sense.

Yeah.

Uh, I think I'm... I guess
I'm going to get out.

OK.

Are you gonna get out now too?

I'll be out in a little bit.

OK.

See you later.

Happy birthday.

I heard today was your birthday.

Oh.

Don't move.

You look perfect right there.

Hello... oh, nice.

Very nice.

Fuck.

Fucking shit, look at that.

Is today really your birthday?

Are you 18?

Hopefully.

Where you going?

I got you a cake.

Hey.

You see where Summer
and Doug went?

I don't see them.

I asked you if you
saw where they went.

No.

OK, thanks.

Why don't you go do some work?

Yeah.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

These images are
trying too hard

To capture the over... the
overall image of the woods.

You know, I think the essence
is, as opposed to, uh, I

Think that's fine
for some of the work

That we've done in the past.

But...

We need pictures.

We need pictures
that work for us.

I was thinking about a
more individual approach.

Perfect.

Go.

Go with that.

Yes.

The little things in the forest.

Like, like mushrooms,
acorns, squirrels...

More like kind of specific...

Details, that's great.

That's great.

That work together.

And actually...

Listen, what you're trying to
say is that we need to align.

Let's see what you've
got for me, young man.

Well, this will make
quite the nice photograph.

The curve of the tree reminds me
of a beautiful, flowing ocean.

Quite the talented eye
we've got here, folks.

I'm wondering, what is the
blurring supposed to represent?

Ah.

We're you planning on
taking that one again?

[MAN SCREAMING]

Poor exposure can
lead to shallow depth

Of field and improper focus.

I can see that you're
having some problems.

You might want to
check your lens.

You might want to try ClarActix!

Hm.

That glass sure
could use a cleaning.

What you like a free sample?

Would you like a try?

When the dirt and the
grime become obscene,

Just call your friend,
Ms. Clara Clean.

When the fuss and the muss
make you want to scream,

Don't worry... she's
here, Ms. Clara Clean.

And if your windows
won't stay clear,

Throughout the harshest
weather, try ClarActix!

You'll see.

Now, isn't that better?

So, um, have you...

No.

You didn't let me finish.

Doug and Summer have
not yet returned.

So you are expecting them?

Why would I not?

OK.

You ready for this?

You ready?

Mm.

Yeah.

All right.

The whisper of a summer breeze,
the chatter of a thousand

Leaves.

ClarActix!

Brand window cleaner gives you
front row seats to the greatest

Show on earth,
your own backyard.

ClarActix!

It brings you closer.

Yeah.

Yeah.

It's a... that's pretty
awful, there, Kimble.

Uh.

Do you think maybe Sonia saw
were Summer and Doug went?

Why are you worried?

Because.

Because why?

Because.

Summer knows her way back.

Yeah, right.

What?

Nothing.

OK.

What if they're not lost?

What does that mean?

I mean, what if Doug
got then lost on purpose?

Why would Doug do that?

Because Doug's an asshole.

That's not a very
helpful attitude.

I just really think
we should do something.

We are doing something.

What are we doing?

We're waiting.

Hey, I'm working.

And you should be working too.

I was working.

Well, then give me
the photos you took,

So I can upload them
on to the computer.

I need to get some
different ones.

OK.

I think we should
go look for them.

Where?

I thought we could
go down to the water,

And then retrace our steps back.

Uh.

It's already getting dark.

Yeah.

So that means we have
to leave right now.

Yeah.

All right.

I'll go tell Sonia.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

were you unhappy

With the pictures you took?


you seemed unhappy.

(YELLING INTO DISTANCE) Hello!

didn't turn out so hot.

(YELLING INTO DISTANCE) Hello!

I've been having

A lot of trouble
getting work done.

I've thought that uh, nature
would, uh, help me focus

My brain, but I've
been very distracted.

Sonia?

Yeah.

I've been having trouble
focusing my camera.

What?

I think my lens is busted.

I want to use Doug's camera.

Well, Doug has Doug's camera.


You know, he's probably not
doing anything with Summer.

It's not like you even
know her that well.

I slept with her last night.

You did?

You couldn't tell?

No, I couldn't tell at all.

No, I had like
a... I had like a...

Hey, his camera
bag is still here.

I had like a vision,
when I slept with her.

It felt really, really good.

And...

Yeah, I feel like
that too sometimes.


Doug!

something in my brain.

And I guess it had
always been there,

But, but I never
noticed it before.


Look at this.

It's busted.

Doug!

Doug!

I found it by the wall.

What is that?

Wait a minute.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Did you think this was funny?

Did you like that?

Why didn't you just come?

I called you.

What?

I want to get off
the phone here.

You called me?

You know what I mean.

I don't know what you mean.

What are you talking... we
weren't even around here.

Kimble?

What?

You want to look at this?

Sonia thinks we were hiding
in the trees around the camp

This entire time.

Really?

Yeah.

And she said that she
heard noises like branches.

And then she thought
she heard whispering.

Huh.

I think she's just
having a little (HIGH

boop-bip, ' withdrawl.

You think that maybe Summer and
Doug are playing a trick on us?

OK.

[CLEARS THROAT] That's
right by the camera.

Wait, don't skip that one.

Go back.

Fuck!

Ah.

Take the card out.

I-I can't.

I can't.

Take the cart out.

I can't because the
computer erases the data

Off the card when it transfers
it into the computer.

What?

It's default setting.

Fuck.

[HEAVY SIGH]

Sonia and I think
that we should

Wait until morning
to go back into town.

In case, Doug and
Summer come back.

They're not coming back.

Well, I'll stay here then.

And wait.

Whatever.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


[FIRE CRACKLING]

Ben?

Yeah?

Ben?

Heh.

I want to tell you
about something, Ben.

Oh, yeah?

I think it'll help
you with your problems.


I think it'll help you see
just a little bit more clearly.

Would you like me to
tell you about that, Ben?




Well...



[MUSIC PLAYING]


What is that?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Let's get him in the light.

Where are his clothes?

Come here.

Doug?

Doug.

Doug.

Come on.

Get a blanket.


Now, Sonia.

Give me that.

Want to drink some of this, huh?

Well, he's a doctor, right?

Just want him.

[ENGINE RUNNING]

Great.

Where the fuck is Summer?

I don't know.

What are we going to do?

Well, we waited
and Doug turned up.

Maybe we should just...

Uh huh.

Wait until morning,
and then walk.

Walk where?

Walk to a cellphone signal.

What the hell was Doug
doing with his car?

I don't know.

[FIRE CRACKLING]

I think that...

Hey!

[MUSIC PLAYING]


[WINCING AND GAGGING]

What did you do to her?

What did you do to her?


Doug!

[HEAVY BREATHING] Doug?

Doug?

Doug.

look up from your desk

And think to
yourself, my goodness,

What an awful mess my
windows have become?

I've got a product that'll make
your glass so crystal clear,

You'll swear you could stick
your arm right through it.

And you look like you could
use a little window cleaning.

Would you like to
try a free sample?

Wouldn't it be
better if you could

See without those
glasses of yours?

Maybe you can.

When was the last
time you really tried?

Now when I look out
over the edge here,

All I see are jagged rocks,
bushes, and a few sap roots.

What do you see?

I'm not going over there.

Oh, don't worry about me.

I'll wait right here.

Go on.

Take a look.

There.

Isn't that better?

Come with me, Ben.

Sonia.

Sonia!

Stop!

Just listen to me.

What are you going to say?

We have to wait for
them to come back.

No.

We have to leave.

I have a plan.

I have a plan about how to
deal with the situation.

No, you don't.

You say you have a
plan, because you think

That's what you're
supposed to say.

Just listen to the plan.

Why don't you think
for yourself for once?

I'm gonna say
this one more time.

And that's the last time
I'm going to say it.

Listen to me!

Listen to me!

Listen to me!


[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello?!

[MUSIC PLAYING]

[DETUNED RADIO NOISES]

[SCREAMING ECHOING]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

I didn't mean to.

I really didn't.

[FIRE CRACKLING]
