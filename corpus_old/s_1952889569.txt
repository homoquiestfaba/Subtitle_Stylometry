Dead Sexy
thriller,2001

Are you more relaxed now?

-How should l do it?
-What?

-Chalk. How do l draw a body on water?
-You should've brought your watercolours.

Twenty-seven years on the force
and l never got to swim on the job.

Nice night for it, Steve.

-Here, before you catch a cold.
-Thanks.

-You McBain?
-Yeah.

Detective Keith Rackles.

Captain Snyder said you'd be here.
He didn't say you looked this good.

You shouldn't have told me either.

So?

-What you got?
-She fell from somewhere up there.

Busted her nose on the bottom of the pool.

Good thing she hit the water,
otherwise we'd have a real mess.

Hey, you.
You shooting for P.D. or Playboy?

-What shall l do with the body?
-Just--

Go ahead and fish her out
and get me a sample of the lipstick.

You got it.

Lipstick.

Look, all l'm saying is,
this is my crime scene.

You're the new kid in town,
so you need to sit back and take notes.

Really. l never sit back.
And l left my pen with your modesty.

l've had experience
handling women like you before.

-Yeah, who?
-My ex-fianc√©e.

That explains the "ex."

-Get a load of this fucking place, Rackles.
-Billy, what are you doing here?

Waiting to meet the girl of my dreams.
Where did you find this one?

That's Detective McBain.
Just transferred down from Frisco.

You get tired of the cold weather?

No. Just the idiots.

You'll have to excuse Billy,
he hasn't quite evolved yet.

So what's up?

Well, the bed's been slept in...

...her clothes are on the floor
and then there's this.

Was she alone?

-Desk clerk says she checked in alone.
-Neighbours see anyone coming or going?

-Nobody saw nothing.
-Sounds like a jumper.

Girls go nuts for champagne.

Yeah, and every dick thinks he's a Romeo.

Well, l wouldn't know about that.

Her name's Georgia Gaines,
investment broker.

Single. No boyfriend. Never been married.

Front desk said she checked in alone.

And no one saw anyone
entering or leaving her room.

What do we have on the girl?

Her neck was broken, probably on impact.

Her only possessions were her coat
and her handbag which contained...

...a change purse and some makeup,
an empty clasped envelope...

...and a champagne bottle...

...and one glass, her lipstick on it.

Textbook jumper.

-You know girls when they get hormonal.
-Good work, Detective.

-You got something to say, McBain?
-Yeah.

l think she was pushed.

By who, the lnvisible Man?

The champagne bottle was half empty.

The coroner told me the blood-alcohol level
showed she only had about one glass.

Well, maybe she nursed
the same bottle for hours.

The medical examiner also found
high levels...

...of methylenedioxymethamphetamine
in her system: MDMA.

The love drug.

"Methy" what?

Ecstasy.

She would not have taken ecstasy
if she'd planned on being alone.

Well, maybe her date didn't show up
and she grabbed some pills and...

...washed it down with a little bubbly
and said bye-bye to the single life.

Do you think Georgia Gaines
is the only one with this M.O.?

Robin Stone, six months ago, downtown.

Dee Phillips, Manhattan Beach, last month.

Both blonde, young,
beautiful investment brokers...

...found dead in a hotel room,
wearing lingerie.

No prints in the room except theirs.

Both sipping champagne
and popping ecstasy.

Where'd you find the time to dig this up?

They were also both wearing lipstick
that was smudged over by another lipstick.

l took samples of the smudge...

...and compared it to the one
Georgia Gaines was wearing.

lt came up with a three-way match:
Burgeon Rouge.

lt's a lipstick imported and distributed
by a small company called Antoinette.

Three girls turn up dead
wearing the same shade of lipstick.

lt's more than just a coincidence.

l think the workings of a serial killer.

Robin Stone was your case, Rackles.

What would l know about lipstick?

l want you to find out more about this girl
and put out an APB...

...in case another victim
with the same kind of evidence turns up.

l don't want to hear of another incident like
the one you started with Detective Trainer.

l started?

l want you to keep your emotions in check.

ls that clear, Detective?

Yes, sir.

Now get the hell out of here, all of you.

l don't believe this. He started it.

He's a rookie, he doesn't know any better.

You've got to learn to just blend in.

Blend in?

-l don't have a $1,000 watch.
-Try $5,000.

How does a rookie cop get a $5,000 watch?

Let's just say,
rich kid who wanted to be a cop.

God, that is good.

l guess that APB worked.

Malibu precinct called me right away.
The victim is Heather LeBow, 24.

Colorado driver's license.
UCLA student lD.

She was wearing that
"Baton Rouge" lipstick.

Burgeon Rouge.

-l suppose you know that.
-Stop spitting, it's a crime scene.

What do you want me to do, swallow?

What do you have, Steve?

Her neck's broken, ribs are broken...

...hip is shattered,
abrasions around the throat.

l need to know if she was strangled
before she was thrown off the cliff.

Check the neck abrasions
for any traces of fabric.

l'm looking for a scarf or gloves.

-Follow me back to the station?
-Would "no" be out of the question?

Secure the area. Put an officer on it.

l want impressions of all the tyre marks,
footprints, treads, anything you can find.

Gotcha.

Won't do you any good to argue with her.

What's he doing here?

He came to help secure the crime scene
and watch the show.

Get off my car.

The girls were all strangled.
They all had sex with the same man.

The medical examiner found fibres of black
leather in the abrasions on their neck.

We're thinking a pair of gloves.
We found this.

lt's a tape found in the answering machine
of our cliff-jumper, Heather LeBow.

<i>-...tower. Good evening.
-Hello?

<i>Hello?

-So?
-lt was the last phone call before she died.

The caller hung up
a few seconds after she picked up.

-The caller wanted to see if she was home?
-Apparently so.

We're going to have it digitally enhanced
so we can identify the clicking.

And then there's this.

l cross-referenced the numbers
in the girls' personal telephone books.

l came up with one number the same,
different names next to it.

Paul and Peter both at 555-2808.
And Pancho at 555-2808.

Phil at 555-2808.

So l'm going to run a check on the number
to find out who it really belongs to.

What is it?

"Call Pat at 555-2808."

Hello?

Detective McBain?

Who are you?

l'm Pat. Pat Pollard.

You're Pat? l thought....

My assistant called you.
l've been expecting you.

Do you want to put that thing away
so that we can talk?

Go ahead. l'm listening.

Four women are dead.

They've been listed
in the obituaries as suicides.

But you might want to look at it further.

l can help you.

<i>But it has to be kept confidential.

<i>All right. You and me.

<i>Come into my office.

Have a seat.

Do you drink a lot of champagne?

lt was a gift
from one of my antiques dealers.

l have a warehouse full of old furniture...

...but that's not my main business.

The four girls?

They were my girls.

So, you are a madam?

lt all started out quite accidentally
at one of my parties.

A rich diplomat met one of my friends,
a beautiful, young, former Miss Louisiana...

...who was studying
Business Administration at UCLA.

They both got pretty drunk...

...and he propositioned her $1,000
to spend the night with him.

She kept bragging about how good
she was, so he upped the offer to $3,000...

...which she refused.

Then he offered me an additional $2,000
if l could convince her.

Which l did.

My girls are the best in the business.
The classiest.

What about the men, your customers?

They range from royalty to tycoons,
bank owners...

...to young, spoiled brats.

Unfortunately, four of my girls
have turned up dead...

...and that's not good for business.

Why didn't you call the police sooner?

l don't trust the cops. Not in my business.

But l heard about you,
the new girl in town.

l figured you're a lot like me.
Trying to survive in a man's world.

You? You won't fuck me.

l'll need to see a list of all your clients.

Especially the ones
who may have been with all four girls.

l can arrange that.
There were three of them...

...and they were all referred to me
by Lilliana, a girl l let go.

-Lilliana--
-She has her own business now.

l'll give you her number.

That's as long as we reach
some sort of agreement.

Right.

You're in the furniture business.

Lilliana?

You found me.

Well, yeah, not without a little work.

-You had questions about the murders?
-Yeah.

Do you know if any of your clients
slept with all four girls?

Three of them did.

<i>Do you know which one might've been
with them on the nights they were killed?

<i>It's impossible for me to say.

<i>I'm in the introduction business,
not the pandering business.

l make my introductions, take my cuts...

...and my clients are free to call the girls
when they want to.

Who were these guys?

Charles Denmore,
a real estate broker from Orange County.

Gerardo Orlando,
a horse owner from Temecula.

And the third?

Lilliana, this is an investigation
into a murder.

His name is Blue.

Blue....

<i>That's the name he goes by.
All the girls wanted to be with him.

And why is that?

Because of the way he makes them feel.

Do you think he would have slept
with all four girls?

Yes.

But Blue didn't kill them.
He's not capable of that.

And what makes you so sure?

Trust me, l know. He slept with me first...

...and l'm still alive
to talk about it, aren't l?

Do you think any of your clients
have any kinky habits?

All men have kinky fantasies, darling.

But l don't recall
any of them involving murder.

What about drugs?

Did anybody like to use ecstasy?

l can't speak for the other two gentlemen...

...but Blue didn't need to use that.
He could love all by himself.

Can l meet him?

You won't be disappointed.

Bad idea.

Well, somebody's got to get close enough
to get into his world.

Well, maybe it's a little too dangerous.

For what? For woman?

l was going to say, it might be better
if l do it since he's a sort of Valentino.

You're worried about me? That's cute.

l'm worried about the case.

Maybe l misjudged you.

You wouldn't be the first.

Maybe your fianc√©e misjudged you, too.

-A little too late for that, isn't it?
-Yeah.

Spit out the window.

So, what's a babe like you
doing without a guy?

Excuse me?

Or are you one of those lipstick lesbos?

ls that real or are you just testing me?

So, l'm right. You like chicks.

Chicks. Yeah, l like chicks.

FYl, you've always got
an open invitation, right here.

The day l become that desperate...

...that's the day l'll be a lesbian.

Do you think l could watch?

You might hurt yourself.

Charles Denmore,
real estate developer from Tustin...

...single-handedly put Laguna Niguel
on the map.

Lives in Newport. Wife, no kids.

Gildardo Orlando,
has a ranch in Temecula where he breeds...

...world-class thoroughbreds.
Has a 3-year-old aptly named Call Girl.

Won second place,
Kentucky Derby last year.

Rutherford Dresden.

Ripe age of 40,
one of the richest men in the state.

Just inherited several conglomerates
from Daddy.

One being Antoinette Cosmetics.

You want to know what they manufacture?

Lipstick: Bludgeon Rouge.

He's single, he lives in Pacific Palisades
and his friends call him "Blue."

Good job, Rackles.

lt's a good start.

But we need to dig further
into all three of them.

So divide and conquer.

l'll stay on Dresden.

Fine.

You two handle the others. Now beat it.

<i>-...tower. Good evening.
-Hello?

<i>Hello?

<i>-...tower. Good evening.
-Hello?

Metropolitan precinct.

Yeah. Hold on.

Got a call for you. Line 1.

-McBain.
<i>-So I called him.

Who?

<i>Blue. I told him I had a girl
he had to meet.

When?

Midnight.

<i>-Tonight?
-You said you wanted to meet him.

<i>Hold on.

-Where's Rackles?
-Poker game.

-Where's Captain Snyder?
-Poker game.

Okay.

<i>-Where do I go?
-The Century Towers Hotel. Suite 2600.

He's my best client,
so don't dress like a hooker.

<i>Don't act like a cop,
unless he tries to kill you...

<i>...which I doubt he'll do.

<i>He's going to sweep you off your feet,
darling.

<i>I told him you were new...

<i>...and you were one of the best girls
I'd seen in a long time.

<i>And I told him your name was Grace.

-Hi. l'm--
-Grace.

Lilliana said l wouldn't be disappointed.

-Are you?
-That remains to be seen.

There's $5,000 in the envelope next to you.

$5,000.

That's what l was told.

You are beautiful.

Thank you.

-Do you have anything to drink?
-Champagne?

Great.

Only one glass?

l don't drink.

Well, l don't drink alone.

-Could you excuse me for one minute?
-Yes.

Make yourself at home.

You know, l was thinking
that maybe we'd go see a show.

Great. l love shows.
l hear <i>Phantom is back.

Not that kind of show.

What kind of show?

-What do you think?
-Not exactly what l had in mind.

Wait here.

-l had a great time tonight.
-Me, too.

l think it would be a little more fun
to wait until another time.

You're kidding.

No.

-Come on.
-Good night.

l got your message.
Been looking all over for you.

What the hell are you thinking about,
seeing him alone?

-Well, everybody else was playing cards.
-Then you don't go.

lf he'd tried to kill you,
l wouldn't have been there to stop him.

l'm tired. Let's talk about this tomorrow.

We're not talking tomorrow,
we're talking about it now.

l'm your partner.

Okay. He didn't kill me. Good night.

l had no idea you owned the place.

How do you think l find all my clients?
How do you think l found Blue?

So, how was he?

He was everything you said he'd be.

l bet he wouldn't sleep with you,
would he?

How did you know that?

You're special.
You're something he's looking for.

l bet he's saving you.

For what?

lf he didn't sleep with you,
it means he likes you.

So did he pay you?

Yeah.

$5,000 and you didn't even have
to sleep with him.

lf you ever get tired of hassling people,
you can always come work for me.

My cut.

-l can't believe l'm actually doing this.
-That's what l used to say.

That pill l swiped from his briefcase
turned out to be plain old aspirin.

-No trace of ecstasy?
-No.

Maybe you looked in the wrong place.
Maybe he laced the champagne.

-Did you get a sample of it?
-No.

Did you look in his room
for any black leather gloves?

No.

Any lipstick?

What about the other suspects?
What have we got going there?

We're working on that.
They're both clean right now.

And neither of them drive a Mercedes.

Am l missing something?

Forensics found tyre tracks at the cliff site.

The tyre comes from a special edition,
a convertible Mercedes.

So, l was wondering,
what kind of car does Blue drive?

-We took a limo.
-How convenient.

Yes, it was.

We just got a call from the San Pedro P.D.
Blue's mother died in 1972.

-Do you want to know how?
-How?

She jumped off the St. Thomas Bridge
and went splat on a passing barge.

-She kind of favours you, McBain.
-Get out of here.

Here's the weird part.

When they pulled her body out,
she had on a fresh coat of red lipstick.

Trainer, l want to see the full case file.

See if Blue underwent any psychiatric
examinations after his mother's death.

McBain, stay with him.
See where he leads.

Mr. Dresden's room is just down the hall.

Thank you.

By the way,
my manager told me to ask you:

Will you be shooting anything?
l mean, the walls are kind of thin.

lf l do, l'll use a silencer.

Cool.

-Hold it!
-Please don't kill me!

You can keep the money.
lt's in the envelope.

-Where is he?
-He's late.

He left me roses and a card
and told me to enjoy the room.

A man in a blue Porsche, did you see him?
Can l get my keys, please?

Shit.

Strange finding you here.

Yeah, l know what you mean.

l have a confession.

Look, l hardly know you.

l was here to meet another girl,
but l backed out.

Why?

l couldn't stop thinking about you.

-Really?
-Really.

You want to go for a ride?

You didn't tell me
you lived in such a dump.

Yeah, well.

Do you live here alone?

No, actually,
l live here with my housekeeper.

-l could give you the grand tour.
-That would take about a week.

l could stretch it out to two.

So, do you bring
all your women back here?

No.

Why me?

You're not like the other women.

-Hi.
-l didn't wake you up, did l?

No. l woke up on my own...

...which is kind of funny
because it's your house...

...and l probably should have been
the one to leave first.

Yeah, well, l really couldn't sleep.

Work usually helps.
l made some hot chocolate.

-Did you want some?
-No, l'm fine. Thanks.

ls that your mom?

Yes.

-She's beautiful.
-Thank you.

Actually, you two could be sisters.

Where is she now?

She's dead.

-l'm sorry.
-That's okay.

She committed suicide when l was a kid.

lt must have been hard on you.

Then, it was a relief.

She'd been cheating on my father.

You knew about it?

Oh, yeah. She used to take me with her.

Actually, l was the one who told my father.

l'm sorry.

l loved my mother
and l know she loved me...

...but when she died,
we were on pretty bad terms.

Anyway, this is for tonight.

About the money--

No, l gotta keep this relationship
in perspective just for me.

Okay.

l'll be downstairs.

You get dressed
and l'll give you a ride back to your car.

Shit, Rackles!

Drama club.

Tell me, do you still know how to act...

...or do you find it hard
to separate your work from reality?

What the hell are you doing in my house?

lt's cold outside.

So, what, you just broke in?

Hell, no, l'd never do that.

Go home, Rackles.
lsn't it past your bedtime?

McBain, l'm worried about you.

Clearly, Blue finds you sexy.

l just don't want to find you "dead" sexy.

He hasn't been proven a killer.

Oh, really? Well, what about his mother?

You think that was just a coincidence.

You know, you may find this hard
to believe, but he loved his mother.

He doesn't love anyone.
That's why he sleeps with whores.

-l'm not a whore.
-l didn't say you were.

-Fuck off, Rackles.
-You slept with him, didn't you?

Get out of here!

l swear to God,
l'm going to call the Captain right now.

l'm sure he'll be happy to hear from us
at 2:00 in the morning.

You only pressed six numbers,
but you can hang it up. l'm leaving.

Look, if there's anybody that has a problem
differentiating reality...

...and work, it is you.

Have you got some personal vendetta?
What is it?

Well, Charles Denmore, Gildardo Orlando...

...they're all squeaky clean, McBain.

The tyre tracks don't match.
So, Blue? He's our only suspect.

Then get another one.

Did you check his tyres?
Maybe he put custom tyres on his car.

Good night!

<i>I just got the case file
on the mother's suicide.

They weren't able to do an autopsy.
The father had the body cremated.

The coroner's report mentions
that she had a broken neck.

They assumed that was caused
by her collision with the barge.

But take a look at these marks.

These marks look just like the ones
we found on the other dead girls.

l talked to the cop who found her body.
He's retired now.

He doesn't think she jumped.

Why's that?

She left her car on the bridge,
but they never found her keys...

...not on her body, not in the car.

So they fell in the water. So what?

Blue was missing
when they found her body.

When they picked him up,
he had her keys in his pocket.

How did the San Pedro P.D.
get involved in all this?

l told you. They called me.

-l mean, how did they know about it?
-l don't know. Maybe from your memo?

Do we have anything
on that psychiatric evaluation yet?

l put a call in to the DA.

lf the state required him to see a shrink
after his momma went bye-bye...

...they'd have a record of it.

Good. Keep me posted.

How well do you know Billy Trainer?

Don't tell me you want to do him, too.

l never mentioned Blue in my memo.

So maybe he did a little homework himself.

You're not the only one here
who wants to make a good impression.

You said he was from
a wealthy background, right?

Do you think he knows Blue?

l told you, it's an 18th century Newport.

l can't let it go for anything less than $250.

Listen, l'm going to have to call you back.
All right? 'Bye.

Were you talking about a girl
or a piece of furniture?

What's the difference?

Well, have you ever tried to hump
a piece of furniture?

Yeah, my first husband.
Gave me splinters.

l haven't seen you in a long time.

So how are you doing?

Better.

Why do you still keep a picture
of her here?

Because she was beautiful.
What are you doing here?

l can't imagine you're here to reminisce.

Actually, l need to talk to one of your girls.

Do you have one in mind,
or do you want me to pick?

<i>-...tower. Good evening.
-Hello?

<i>Hello?

<i>Hello?

-Hey.
-Hey, how are you doing?

Good. What you got?

l've cleaned it
and even digitally enhanced it...

...but l'm still not sure
where it comes from.

There is one thing, though.

The word "evening" gets stretched
right after the first click. Listen.

<i>-...tower. Good evening.
-Hello?

<i>Hello?

My VCR does that when l press "Pause."

Exactly.

Whoever left the message
was playing a videotape on their VCR.

Maybe we can find out
what was on the tape.

Good possibility. Let me check it out.

McBain, you've got a phone call. Line 2.

Thanks. Can we get somebody
to make some fresh coffee?

-McBain.
<i>-Kate, this is Lilliana.

Hi. What's up?

<i>Blue called.

He told me to tell you
he can't see you anymore.

Why didn't he call me himself?

He didn't want to hurt you.

<i>-Was he planning on hurting me?
-He didn't mean for things to go that far.

He wants them to stop before they do.

Well, l guess he finally came around then?

<i>He'd only hurt you anyway, darling.

l was wondering when you'd show up.

You could have talked to me in person.
l can take rejection.

l was in meetings all day,
and Lilliana volunteered to call you.

That's not what she said.

Well, that's Lilliana.

Why didn't you take the money
l left for you the other night?

You know why.

Made you feel like a whore?

No. Made me feel.

-Now, Grace, l can't do this.
-Do what?

A relationship. l haven't had one
in a long time and l'm not about to start.

l thought you said you didn't drink.

l didn't...

...until l met you.

They're all hookers.

l slept with every one of them.
Now they're all dead.

l got to stop seeing you, Grace.

l don't want the same thing
to happen to you.

lt couldn't, could it?
You didn't kill them, did you?

Of course l didn't.

After all the loss l've suffered in my life,
do you honestly think l could kill someone?

-Why didn't you just go to the police?
-l did go to the police.

Right after the first two girls
got murdered.

l thought it was a strange coincidence.
l didn't want them to think l was involved.

l told them everything
about my relationship with the girls.

The same thing happened with my mother.

What do you mean?

The cops,
they asked me all kinds of questions.

They asked me
if l pushed my mother off the bridge.

l was 13 years old.
She was everything to me.

l thought because the suicides
were similar...

...that they might think
that l had something to do with it.

Good morning.

Good morning. Didn't you sleep late.

-lt's 6:30.
-Yes, but l get up at 5:00.

"l get up at 5:00."

-Do you want some cereal?
-Yes, l do. Thank you.

<i>I'm Lynn Hightower. Good evening.

<i>Updating our earlier story, about the boy...

<i>...lost in the San Bernardino Mountains--

Doesn't Lynn Hightower
anchor the evening news?

When l go out at night...

...l like to tape the news
so l can watch it in the morning.

<i>The discovery was made today
by a couple of hikers...

<i>...who were hiking
in the nearby mountains.

<i>I'm Lynn Hightower. Good evening.

We'll get back with you
as soon as we know something.

Okay, great. Thanks. 'Bye.

Where is everybody?

They're interrogating a hooker
who claims Blue killed those other girls.

Rackles was right about him.

So, how long did Georgia know Blue?

Georgia had been with Blue several times.
Finally, she came to me.

She was worried.
He'd wanted her to take ecstasy.

She was afraid, because she knew...

...Robin and Dee took ecstasy
the nights they were killed.

lf you knew these things,
if you knew that he might be the killer...

...then why'd you go
to the Century Towers Hotel to meet him?

l didn't know it was him.

Not until l got to the room
and l saw his note.

Patty told me l was seeing
a man named Rutherford Dresden.

Well, didn't you know
that Rutherford Dresden is Blue?

l do now!

Bullshit. Who's been talking to you?

Nobody. l knew he wouldn't try
to hurt me because...

...l heard he loves blondes.

Hell, he'd probably go nuts over you.

Did you know one of your girls
came into the station this morning...

...and in a sworn statement
told me Blue killed those other women?

You must be referring to Carla.

That's right.
Does she have any reason to frame Blue?

l don't think Carla even knows Blue.
She's not his type.

Really?

Carla told me Georgia Gaines
was afraid of Blue.

Where did she hear that from?

From Georgia, the night before she died.

-They were friends.
-Friends? l doubt it.

Why would she lie?

How would l know?
l'm their agent, not their shrink.

Had any visitors lately?

Just an old customer.

What did he want?

To see one of my girls.

When you worked for Pat...

...did you ever come across
a client named Rackles?

Yes, l remember him. He was a detective.

Did he know Blue?

-They have a history.
-What kind of history?

Robin Stone.

-The first girl that died.
-What about her?

She was engaged to Rackles.

When Rackles found out
Blue was sleeping with her...

...he threatened Blue.
He had to be restrained.

Robin died a week later.

"Back off, bitch?" ls that supposed
to throw me off your trail?

What are you talking about?

You hid a statement from Blue
in your filing cabinet.

l'm talking about how you asked Carla
to lie about him.

Where did you hear that one?

You're just doing your damnedest
to try and set him up, aren't you?

You don't know what you're talking about.

l know Robin Stone was your fianc√©e.

When you found out
she was screwing around with Blue...

...she turned up dead
and you tried to pin it on him.

You even threatened him.

l see you've been talking to Lilliana.

Did she also tell you that he filed
a restraining order against me?

l never even went near him.

Why didn't you tell me about Robin?

-lt wasn't relevant.
-lt's a conflict of interest.

Maybe l have trouble sleeping at night.

Maybe l have other reasons
why l want the case to end...

...but l haven't framed anybody.

Why did you call Pat to find Carla?

Carla called me. She left Pat's number.

How else do you think we brought her
in here for her statement?

l haven't told anyone to lie,
and l disregard a half-assed statement...

...because l believe he came in here
to cover his sorry ass.

Just like he filed
that restraining order against me.

-That's crap.
-He's a liar. He's a lowlife liar.

He's manipulating Lilliana
just like he manipulated all those girls.

Now, he's manipulating you.

-You don't know--
-You're falling for him.

Just like that suspect up North.

You can't keep your pants on.

Fuck you.

He's withholding evidence.

Maybe he's putting together a case.

Well, then he should have told me!

So he didn't tell you. So what?

He asked a witness to commit perjury.

So call Kenneth Starr.

Do you have any proof of that?

l'll get it.
You get Carla in here and l will get it.

Why don't you sit this one out, Detective,
before you get transferred again?

Captain Snyder.

We'll be right out.

l just received a copy of Dr. Strober's
psychiatric evaluation of Blue...

...after his mother's death.
ln a nutshell, it states...

...that Blue was sexually molested
by his mother countless times...

...between the ages of 10 and 13.

Did the doctor suspect
Blue killed his mother?

Not according to his notes.
But l did some checking and discovered...

...Dr. Strober is an old school buddy
of Blue's father.

You're suggesting the father
asked him to lie?

No, l'm saying that Blue's father...

...paid Dr. Strober to say...

...that Blue was incapable
of murdering his mother.

l hope that helps you sleep better at night.

Six months after the case was closed,
an apparent suicide...

...our good Dr. Strober moved
from a two-bedroom in Encino...

...to a six-bedroom in Bel Air.

lf Blue is the killer, seeing this woman
may have been a trigger for him.

Because she looks so like his mother...

...it brought back all these feelings
of lust and rage.

So he went out to re-enact
his childhood trauma...

...on other, more accessible women...

...who resembled his mother.

And to make it even more real...

...he asked them to wear
his mother's lipstick:

Burgeon Rouge.

Detective McBain looks more like
his mother than any of these women do.

Why didn't he kill her?

Maybe they're so much alike
he wants to reverse the pattern.

ln order to undo what he already did.

Remember, he's struggling
with two very powerful emotions:

Rage and lust. He's highly volatile.

Who knows which one
will ultimately triumph.

Good morning.

You keep late hours, Detective.

How did you find out?

lt seems somebody sent me this article.
Very interesting.

Who gave you that?

l don't know.
There wasn't a return address.

lt seems that you have a habit
of sleeping with men you're investigating.

lt's a bad habit for a cop.

You know, if l were you,
l'd take a good look at your partner.

You know he's had a hard-on for me
ever since Robin Stone got murdered.

lf you ask me, he's the one that killed her.

She found out how he was getting
the money to pay her.

How was he getting the money?

Police impound.
He was stealing confiscated drug money.

Check it out. This is for you.

lf you want to see me later,
you know where to find me.

'Bye.

-Hi, Anton.
-Hi. lt's on the house.

Have you seen Blue?

Not yet.
But l will personally send him over.

How about Lilliana? ls she around?

Not tonight. Tonight she has a date.

l thought she didn't do that anymore.

She does that for $5,000.

Anton. Century Towers Hotel?

How did you know?

Yeah. Detective McBain.

l got an attempted homicide
at the Century Towers Hotel.

l need backup immediately.

-Did you see his Mercedes?
-Yeah.

-She checked into room 2600.
-What are you doing here?

l heard the call on my radio.
l was only a block away.

-All right, watch the front. l'm going up.
-Sure you want to go up alone?

Okay, whatever. Take the stairs.

Stop!

He's probably on the roof. l met him here.

Stay here. Cover the stairs, all right?

Drop it!

Kate.

Put the gun down!

Why?
Do you think l'm trying to shoot you?

Put the goddamn gun down!

Kate, someone killed Lilliana.

Put the fucking gun down!

He's up here.
lt's the only place he could go.

Drop it, Rack!

Forensics found a used lipstick
in his pocket...

...and her perfume on his clothes.

The guy from lnternal Affairs told me...

...they'd been investigating Rackles
for keeping confiscated drug money.

Apparently, he had a safety deposit box
with $40,000 stashed in it.

Billy found a box of clasped envelopes and
a video of the newscaster in his Porsche.

He'd been framing Blue for months.
No denying it.

Too bad he won't be around
to defend himself.

Guess l owe you an apology, Detective.

You're right about Blue.

Who knows, you may even have been right
about that guy up North, too.

Where's McBain, do you know?

She went home early.

l wanted her to see the coroner's report
on Detective Rackles.

-l'll take it for her.
-All right.

You know, it's weird.

We ran a DNA test on hair we found
in that dead girl's hotel room.

lt didn't match Rackles'.

lt was somebody else's.

Who did it belong to?

Somebody who liked to swim. l found
traces of chlorine on the hair sample.

You scared me.

How you doing, good-looking?

l heard about Lilliana.

All over the news. You okay?

Yeah, l'm fine. Coming in?

He always wanted my life,
even before Robin Stone.

He tried to shake us down for money
or he was going to close down Lilliana.

Then we introduced him to Robin Stone
and he shut the hell up.

Well, he can't have your life now.

Yeah. That would be a neat trick.

l'm so glad it wasn't you.

Yeah, me too. l'd look horrible
in prison orange, wouldn't l?

Come on.
