In the twinkling
of an eye.

More... more!

More, more!

Later...
Magic is very exhausting...

and I am 542 years old.

Oh... you don't look
a day over 200.

Yes, I'm still as bad as
ever I was.

We'll continue after
I've got my rest.

Thank you for not telling
your friend the Demon.

He's not my friend,
he's my husband.

He keeps me in that box
because he's so jealous.

I saved you from him.

And now you must make love to me,
while my husband sleeps.

If you don't,
I'll wake him up...

and he'll rip your head off.

Oh, not again, Sayid.

Giafar,
I had that dream again.

The Demon's wife, she tried
to kill me, so I killed her.

You've had it now
for five years...

ever since your late wife
tried to do the same thing.

I murdered her...
It was an accident, Sayid.

It was an accident!

Allah is just.
You're free of her, Sayid.

I'll never be free of her,
she haunts me still.

Don't let her.

Don't you forget, I have to take
a wife by the next full moon...

or the kingdom will be given
to my dear brother.

May he rot in hell!

Your father wanted you
to marry.

I can't take another wife, she'll try
to kill me too, they all will!

You must.

You lose the kingdom unless you
marry as quickly as possible.

I know what it means...
even the Demon was betrayed...

the dream tells me all wives
are treacherous.

No, no, you just had
a bad experience, Sayid.

There's only one way to deal with
wives, they have to be executed.

Well, I'm sure we've
all felt like that.

I will marry. There will be a
wedding and a wedding night...

but in the morning,
I'll have my wife executed.

I'll kill her before
she kills me.

She can't be a princess of the blood,
her death would cause problems.

Pick me a woman from
the Harem, Giafar.

Someone bright and happy...

and with no thought
for the future.

And in secret...
now send for the Chief Executioner.

But that was not the end
of the story.

After Douban was beheaded,
the King licked his fingers...

and turned to the page
in the dead man's book.

He stared at the words,
and then slumped forward...

dead!

The pages of the book
had been poisoned...

so that the King, wetting his finger,
had executed himself.

Here again, mistress.

That's the sixth time
this week.

These people sit for hours
just listening...

it's a miracle.

People need stories more
than bread itself...

they tell us how to live,
and why.

Sorry I'm late, father.

This is my daughter, Scheherazade.
She's my strong right arm...

you may speak freely
in front of her.

How is the Sultan?

The Sultan is being eaten
by the worm of madness...

it reminds me a little
of the case of Gilgamesh...

the king of Urak when his friend,
the grand warrior...

Can you cure the Sultan?
No... only Allah can do that.

How was Gilgamesh cured?
It was a young woman who did it.

No one knows how... a complete
amateur. Beginner's luck.

That sort of thing can be really,
really distressing...

for an experienced professional
like myself.

When did Schahriar
become so ill?

When I played with him as a child in
the palace he was always so happy.

Everybody loved him.

Madness creeps in unseen
and floods the soul.

You're no help!

Patients often say that,
but what do they know?

Should I get
a second opinion?

Why not?
I can come back tomorrow.

I didn't know Schahriar
was this ill.

I've been trying to keep it
from everybody.

You look terrible, father.

Oh, it's only natural. I have to deal
with the worst kind of madman...

a madman with power!

You understand
what is needed?

I know my job, Sayid.

You wish your bride to be executed
the morning after the wedding.

Early.

There are certain procedural
problems, Sayid...

as I will be executing
her after the wedding...

it means she will be Sultaness...

who by tradition cannot be
hung or beheaded.

Details... details!

Never fear, Sayid, where
there is a will, there is a way.

I can strangle her.
That's what I want.

But, I can't use hemp rope...

...not on a royal throat.
Must I be crossed at every turn?

But there's no objection
to silk!

A silk rope would fulfill
all legal requirements...

rely on me, Sayid.

They haven't seen
each other for years.

That's enough, girls.

Scheherazade.

The Sultan's going
to kill us!

Who told you that?
My mother.

She got it from the cook...

who got it straight from the Chief
Executioner's Assistant, it's a secret.

And her mother's never wrong.
I heard it from a handmaid...

...who heard it from one of the guards.
He's going to marry one of us.

In the morning after the wedding he
is going to have the bride executed.

He's mad, isn't he?
And it won't stop there.

He'll get a taste for it
and kill us all!

I'm sure it's just a rumor.

Don't worry,
I'll talk to my father.

Father, I must speak with you.
What are you doing here, child?

Put some clothes on,
Father, it's urgent.

I blame your late lamented mother,
it's all her fault.

Please be quick, father...

or they'll say you're meeting women
in the steam room.

The women in the Harem are frightened
that it won't stop at one girl...

the Sultan may get a taste
for killing them.

If Schahriar wasn't the Sultan he'd be
locked away till the madness passed.

He was such a loving boy...

we used to climb his father's
favorite peach tree.

One day I fell and cut myself.

He bound up the wound.

Oh, what am I going to do, child?
I can't go through with this.

I can't pick a poor girl
from the Harem...

knowing I'm condemning
her to death!

I may have a way out
for you, father.

I'll marry
Sultan Schahriar myself.

I won't let you sacrifice
yourself for me.

I'm not doing it for you, father...

I'm not even doing it
to save the girls in the Harem...

I'm doing it for Schahriar
and myself.

I love him.

No, you love the boy he was,
not the man he is.

That boy is still
there in him.

You'd have to dig very, very deep
to find him, he's changed completely!

It's not just betrayal
by his wife and brother...

absolute power has eaten
his soul. I know him...

you think you can change him,
but you can't. No one can.

I don't believe that.
Scheherazade, listen to me, listen!

You are all I have.
I beg you.

I beg you!

Don't do this!

I can save him from himself...

I don't know how...

but I've made up my mind.
I know I can do it.

Daughter, when you walk out
onto that balcony...

you'll be married and you will have
signed your own death certificate.

If you love me,
please, please, please...

...please, don't do this.
I know what I'm doing, father.

You don't. You have no idea
what you're doing.

Sayid, your brother, Schahzenan,
wishes to offer his blessings.

May they choke him.

He wants to be reconciled...

it would be good, Sayid,
for peace.

Think of the people.

Show them you're
brothers again.

Schahzenan, kill him! Kill him!

Oh, my love.

Traitor!

No, no.

I hope you have better luck
this time, brother.

Your late wife loved me
from the first.

How will we know
when Sultan's ready?

Be cool.

I think pink will suit
the Sultaness.

You have such good taste, Chief.

Sayid, do you remember me?

From when we were children.

We played together here
in the palace, then I went away.

I don't remember anything
about my childhood.

What's to remember?
I was a child! Why should I?

What is it, Sayid?

I don't trust you.

There's something going on
I don't know about.

Your Giafar's daughter,
yet he let you...

marry me.

Oh, I dream too much...

forty nights...

can't sleep...

so I dream.

My father always takes a glass
of wine and a biscuit...

before going to bed.

This isn't a night when
a man is supposed to sleep.

There.

Is something the matter?

That biscuit has sesame seeds...

I don't like sesame seeds...

Did I say something funny?
No.

It's just that "sesame"
remind me of this wonderful story...

would you like to hear it?

I don't like stories.

You will this one.

It's about Ali Baba
and the forty thieves.

Forty thieves?

Forty nights of dreaming, and now
Forty Thieves... That's strange!

Yes, but no stranger than
the story itself.

You see, Ali Baba was a poor young
man who lived outside Damascus.

His best friend had a hump,
four legs...

and very big teeth.

Saffrow was one of the wisest
camels in all Syria.

Ali Baba's only family was
an older brother, Cassian.

I know Saffrow, I know.

Cassian!

Wake up!

It's time to get up.
Come on.

Unlike his young brother,
Cassian was so lazy.

I told you
I don't like stories.

A master storyteller
once told me...

the audience must be hooked
in the first moments...

otherwise you've lost them.

I'm lost.

That's because I haven't told
you about Black...

Black Coda.

At the time the Kingdom was being
ravaged by savage gangs.

Black Coda led
the most murderous of them.

A monster.

Black...

Coda.

No one was safe.

What's he got to do
with Ali Baba?

He made Ali Baba rich and famous.

No caravan could travel
without fear.

They never Knew when or where
Black Coda would strike next.

He was a master of disguise.

Meanwhile, Ali Baba was collecting
firewood to sell in the local market.

He was a really good-hearted
young man.

It's a slow way to make
a fortune, Abdul...

and I've so many good ideas
for making money...

like my scheme for watering plum trees
with alcohol to grow stewed plums.

I don't care what you think, Saffrow,
I think it's a good idea.

You think that's trouble,
do you, Saffrow?

I think you're right.

Saffrow's warning saved Ali Baba.

Animals can be cleverer
than their masters.

And you can trust them.

Open Sesame!

Down!

Open Sesame!

Down, boys!

Down.

Open Sesame!

Saffrow!

Saffrow! We're rich!

Have you ever seen
anything like it?

Only in your wildest dreams!
Well, not in your dreams, in mine.

It's raining.

Mother, bring in the washing.

No, it's not raining, your mother's
been dead for five years. Get up!

What's for breakfast?
Fresh air.

Why are you sleeping on the edge
of the bed?

So I can just drop off.

Well, get up...
I've got something to show you.

We're going to have
to move house...

in case the robbers find out
who was in their cave.

I want my share.

Of course.
I don't want it all for myself.

What half-and-half?
Half-and-half.

I'm going to the cave to get my share.
No, it could be dangerous.

I can take care of myself.

If you must go, take Saffrow,
she knows the way.

She'll see you don't get
into any trouble.

Saffrow's a camel!

"You don't think I need a camel
to look after me, do you?"

Both Ali Baba and
Saffrow nodded.

There was no question
in their minds...

that Cassian certainly needed
someone to look after him.

Why was Cassian
any different from Ali Baba?

Ali had something Cassian
never had...

a good heart.

You think a good heart
can protect people?

Have you ever known anyone
with a good heart?

No.

Well, anyway, with Saffrow's help...

Cassian found the robber's cave.

Open!

What is it?

Open... open.

Ali Baba had given to
Cassian two biscuits...

to remind of the password.

"Open sesame!"

Down boys!

Down!

I must get Saffrow.

Open... open!

How was it, then?
Open...

Open... Open.

Open.

Open... open corn!

Open barley!

Open Sesame!

Open Sesame...

that was it.

Open Sesame...

Meanwhile, whilst Cassian
was getting himself Killed...

Ali Baba had hired himself
a young serving girl, Morgiana...

to help him now
he had money.

What was this Morgiana like?

Some said she was beautiful.

But she was certainly clever...
and very independent.

She sounds like you.

Like me?

Oh, no, she wasn't like me.
Not like me at all!

That's everything, sir.

Saffrow...

where's my brother?

Where's Cassian?

Oh, poor Cassian!

I should have tried harder
to stop him.

Don't blame yourself.

Come, we should leave
as soon as possible.

No, we must take him with us.

Is that wise?

When the robbers come back
and see the body's gone...

they'll know Cassian
had friends or family...

they might try and find you and do
to you what they did to your brother.

I know you're right Morgiana,
but he must have a decent burial.

We can't... we can't leave him for
the vultures to pick on his bones.

He's my brother.

Black Coda's men move
through the city.

Robbers find nothing wrong
in robbery...

except when it happens to them.

I feel... sad.

But don't you like
your new house?

Of course I do.

I just wish Cassian were here
to enjoy it with me... I miss him.

It's natural...

he was your brother.

Everyone should
have good fortune...

but it just much better...

if there's someone
to enjoy it with.

And so the evil Black Coda
walked up to the city gates...

ready to slaughter Ali Baba
and everyone in his house.

What's the matter?

Nothing, Sayid.

What happened to Ali and Morgiana?
What happened next...

and did Black Coda
kill them...

and... don't you know?

Of course I know,
but I'm tired.

It's already morning.

It can't be morning, morning never
comes for me, it's always night.

I've lost track of time.

So... you won't go on?

Yes...

but storytelling's
best done at night...

at least for me...

I mean, it's hard to create the right
atmosphere with the sun shining...

don't you think?

It's a trick!
A trick to trick me!

No!

No!

What is it, Sayid?
I want you...

to meet somebody!

Who are these men?

Friends, Sultaness.

Please, stay calm.

Stay back!

Sayid!

Sayid!

Sayid!

No.

No.

Please, stay calm.
Stay back!

Sayid!

Sayid, no...

You will finish the story
of Ali Baba tomorrow night!

I sit in the bazaar,
telling stories...

but if the audience isn't
interested in what I'm saying...

it walks away.

But if your audience
isn't interested...

you're dead.

I thought it would be easy
but it isn't.

I almost lost it before
I got started.

I've told you before,
the first moments are vital.

I paused at a good point...

with the thieves sneaking
into Damascus to kill Ali Baba.

Sneaking in how?
In what?

A wagon.
Too ordinary...

it has to be something
more exotic...

your starting your story again...

you have to hook
your audience again.

How?
I was walking last night past...

the Great Mosque
in the street of Sighs...

exactly an hour after sundown...

when I came face to face...

with Death.

Had he come for you?

See...

you're hooked!

As I was saying, Black Coda brought
his whole gang into Damascus...

in a wagon,
to murder Ali Baba.

But it was
no ordinary wagon.

The wagon was carrying
an amount of stone jars.

How did Black Coda
explain the jars?

What's this, old man?

Forty jars of lamp oil...

for the royal palace.

Forty jars of oil...

that's clever...
that's very clever...

obviously Black Coda had
a black heart...

but a very bright brain.

He had that, alright.

Naturally, Ali had no idea
of the danger he was in.

He didn't tremble...

when he should have trembled.

How're we going to protect him,
Saffrow? He's a dreamer!

What about all those schemes
for making money?

He needs someone
to look after him.

Yeah... I love him...

but does he love me?

Your a camel,
what do you know about love?

I'm sorry...

your a wise camel,
aren't you?

There's a wagon parked
in the street outside.

It's a merchant, lady,
with jars of oil for the palace...

he asked permission to leave
his wagon there for a few hours.

Did you check him closely?

Yes, lady.

How much did he give you?
Nothing, lady, nothing!

Isn't there any more oil in the house?
We have to buy some tomorrow.

Didn't you say that merchant
had some jars of oil?

Yes.

He won't mind us talking
a little for the night.

We'll pay him
in the morning.

Life often turns on such
small things...

as a flickering oil lamp.

Praise be to Allah... it can't be
long before the killing starts.

Morgiana, this man's got
a marvelous idea...

for breeding termites
with wooden legs...

I think I should invest...
They've come, Ali!

Who?

The murderers you stole
the money from.

I've got an idea...

follow me.

Chief?

Chief, is that you?

Any moment now.

Hear that men?
Any moment now!

Excellent.

The Black Coda's men.

Black Coda's men
hung like ripe fruit.

It was all over.

Well. Not quite.

Ali Baba threw
a magnificent party...

to celebrate the defeat
of Black Coda and his gang.

Nostradem!

The chief attraction was the most
famous entertainer in all of Islam.

Their jokes enthusiasm the town.

It day to celebrate...

because with the help
of my friend, Morgiana...

Black Coda's gang have been
crushed like...

beetles.

Ask if Morgiana will dance for us,
Ali Baba...

she's a beautiful dancer!

Morgiana.

I didn't know that, Morgiana.

I can't dance a step.

I'll show you.

Morgiana!

That's not funny.

Not funny at all.

Morgiana,
what have you done?

They all kill!
Women are born to hell!

They kill without reason!

She had her reasons.

I... I saw the
tattoo when I offered him wine.

Oh, what would I do
without you?

Is that the end
of the story?

No, no, no.

Faisal and his wife, Safil...

from Constantinople,
were at Ali Baba's wedding.

Faisal had designed
Morgiana's wedding dress.

He was one of the
best tailors in the East...

but both he and his wife always
looked like they'd been stuffed...

by a good taxidermist.

At the wedding...

they met an extraordinary friend
they hadn't seen for years.

Who?

A hunchback.

His name was... BacBac.

Good name, BacBac.

BacBac liked it too...

in fact, BacBac liked most things
about himself... even his hump...

without it, he may not have become
the Sultan's favorite Jester.

I've always supported my family,
they've never wanted for anything...

apart from uncle Abdulah,
he's wanted for bigamy and murder...

in that order.

Anyway, back
in Constantinople...

Faisal invited BacBac
to supper...

and BacBac never
turned down a free meal.

You know Prince Sinbad?

Oh, he is so ugly even starvation
won't look him in the face!

I tell you, I tell you...
no tide would take him out...

when he eats a banana,
he eats it sideways.

And his wife!

Oh! Her face is all dried
and wrinkled like a prune!

She's the sort of woman
you have to look at twice.

The first time,
you don't believe it!

At her wedding,
everyone kissed the groom!

BacBac?

I think he's dead.
Dead? He can't be dead.

You're fooling us, aren't you, BacBac?
Another one of your jokes!

He must have suffocated.

Probably a bone, a fish bone
got stuck in his throat.

Poor BacBac. We must tell
the authorities.

They'll blame us.

It was an accident!
They'll still blame us...

he was the Sultan's favorite...

"There they go, the people whom
killed poor little BacBac."

We'll lose all our customers!
Reputation shattered...

credit destroyed,
income lost.

What're we going to do?

We could take him
to that old physician next door.

It's too late for a physician,
he needs an undertaker.

I mean leave him there...

Let someone else take the blame...

that sounds good!

Calm!

Come on!

He is heavy!

We'll leave him here.
Good.

Come on.

Who's that?

Can I help you?
We came to see Dr. Ezra...

for our friend,
if it's not too late.

It's never too late
with Dr. Ezra.

You wanna bet?
I'll get him...

your friend doesn't look
too good.

Let's go.

Come on, hurry.

Ezra, we have a customer.

Another penniless vagrant?
No, he's paid...

he's outside on the landing.

Show him to me, my dear,
before he gets away!

He's waiting on the stairs.
Be careful...

I can't see where he...

Ezra... Ezra,
Ezra, speak to me!

You must wear your
glasses, Ezra...

how do you feel?

I don't know.
You don't know, you're a physician!

So I'm a physician...

so what else you want you
should tell me?

Sir... your friends said
you don't feel very well.

I'm sure my husband
can help you...

No, he can't.
Of course you can.

No, I don't think so.

He's dead.

The fall down the stairs!
A terrible accident!

It's worse than that.

He comes here for medical
treatment and he ends up dead!

What will this do to
your reputation, Ezra?

He looks familiar.

The Sultan's Jester!

Alas, poor BacBac.

I knew him well.
We're doomed!

We'll be blamed...
we're foreigners!

Help me carry him upstairs...
hurry!

It's amazing how quickly people
can improvise when they have to...

the Ezra's had to
take a gamble...

forgetting that gambling
is only a way of getting nothing...

for something.

There's nothing worse than being
alone in a strange city.

Lift his arms up,
so he'll slide down easier.

It's as if he doesn't like
what we're doing.

Nonsense!
He'd see the funny side of it.

Oh, Buddha, show me a sign...

say I'm not forsaken in
a foreign land...

Robbers! Thieves!

My hands are lethal!

Dead.

I told you about my hands!

I know you...

the famous BacBac...
the Sultan's Jester...

Why did you come down
my chimney?

It's a joke to set
the whole town laughing...

well, the laugh's on you,
Jester BacBac...

no, the laugh's on me...

they'll say I murdered you...
I'll be hanged...

Think of something, Hi-Ching,
think of something...

Murder! I'm being attacked!

You'll get no money from me!

You'll get not a penny from me...

Guards, guards, seize this man...

he just tried to kill me!

Instead, you killed him.
I... I did... splendid!

You're drunk.

This is BacBac...
Drunk?

The Sultan's Jester.

BacBac?
And you killed him.

Why should I kill him,
we haven't even been introduced?

That is for a judge to decide.

And when he has,
we'll hang you!

The trial of Jerome Gribbin
was the social event of the season.

The judge in the case
was the venerable Judge Zadic.

Judge Zadic was totally
incompetent...

but being a judge,
nobody had noticed.

...which I suggest is death,
death by hanging.

Why did you kill him?

I thought he was trying
to rob me.

BacBac rob you?

Forty years administring
justice...

worst excuse I ever heard!

I made a mistake.
You certainly did...

all Constantinople will miss
poor BacBac...

we will never see the like
of him again...

A fellow of infinite jest...

"infinite jest",
that's a good one...

write that down, clerk,
before I forget it.

BacBac lightened our lives...

he gave us laughter,
rich and overflowing...

laughter from the heart.
A heart as big as he was small...

we knew him, we loved him...

we laughed with him...

we'll remember him
all our days.

I sentence you to hang.

Assassin!

No, no, please, no!

No, no, please! No!
Who is this Chinese person?

I killed the poor hunchback.
I stuffed him in the alcove.

No! No!

I killed poor BacBac, and dropped
him down Hi-Ching's chimney.

No! I killed poor BacBac.

I don't understand...
I killed him...

...my hands are lethal!
I tripped over him in the dark!

He's very short-sighted.
You can't hang a man for that!

It was a fishbone!

I'm still the best tailor
in Constantinople!

My head's splitting...
Order in the Court! Order! Order!

I'll have a lamb shish-kebab!

Your Majesty.

Who killed my funny
man Jester BacBac?

I did!

Who do I hang, Sayiddi?

Nobody.

It was an accident!

Besides being my Jester,
Master BacBac was my friend...

and if I knew him right
he would've appreciated...

the manner of his death,
it was his final jest...

dear BacBac didn't have
to be alive to be funny...

even dead, he made us laugh!

As the crowd were
leaving the courtroom...

the most famous magician
in Africa, Mustappa...

passed by on his
way to Samarkand.

He was a charismatic man with
piercing eyes a seductive voice...

and a manner that would freeze
friends at twenty paces.

But he came into a room
the mice jumped on chairs...

but he isn't the hero
of this story.

Who is then?

Eh... Sinbad...

Aladdin.

No!

Cheat.
It's all a cheat.

That race was fixed!

No question...
anyone could see that, Aladdin!

Honest men like us go for
a day at the races...

and get cheated blind out
of our hard earned money.

It just shows honesty doesn't pay.
Let's get back to work.

Sorry, excuse me.

My purse!
I've been robbed!

What's the matter, sir?
That young rogue...

the one who bumped
into me picked my pocket!

I saw which way he went.
This way follow me!

Stop thief!

Who's in the coach?

Let's find out.

Who's that?

Princess Zobeide,
the Caliph's daughter.

Come on. Let's get out of here.
I'm in love!

Come on!

There they are.

Where did you come from?

From the other side
of the world. Africa.

What do you want with me?
Stay calm, Aladdin...

do I look like I'm with
the Caliph's guards?

I'm always calm.
How do you know my name?

I was a friend of your late father.
I didn't know he had any friends.

Oh, very few... just me.

Your father was so crooked...

he could hide in the
shadow of a corkscrew.

You did know him!

Do you want to become rich?
Yes, but quick!

It's the best way.

Business? Shady business?

Shady... shifty... shadowy...

but profitable.

What do I have to do?

First of all, I have
to check your suitability...

Good.

Meet me tomorrow outside
the city gates at dawn.

Here's a small token
of my good faith.

And so Aladdin and Mustappa
left Samarkand.

He didn't trust Mustappa, but
when there was money involved...

Aladdin was prepared
to take a few risks...

I don't want to boast,
but I've never met anyone...

who can live with me in a
straight fight, magic to magic...

So what do want me for
if you're so powerful?

All power has its limits...

I want you to retrieve
an object for me...

I can't get it myself, for reasons
too complicated to get into...

its to do with
the rules of magic...

they're tiresome,
but they must be obeyed.

Why pick me?

You didn't believe I was
a friend of your father's?

Not for a moment...
so, why me?

I saw larceny in your soul.

What do you want me to do?

I want you to go into a tomb...

You'll find an old lamp there.
I want you to bring it to me.

What tomb?

There.
How much?

We'll discuss that when you get back.
No, we discuss it now, or I don't go.

Fifty gold pieces.

Please, don't insult me...

and don't ask me to trust you.
I don't even trust my own shadow.

Two hundred!

Done!

Here's half.

You gave it to easily.
I should have asked for more.

You do so remind me of me
when I was young!

Here now take this ring...

rub it if you get into
any kind of trouble.

Trouble?
What sort of trouble?

Two hundred is not enough!

A deal is a deal!
Don't try and betray me...

if you do, I swear
by Hector's feathers...

you'll never see
your wedding day.

Who's Hector?

My pet raven and
my best friend.

Aladdin didn't Know what Kind
of trouble he was getting into...

if he had, he wouldn't
have taken the two hundred...

on the other hand,
he probably would...

Go on... go on!

Aladdin, have you got
the lamp?

Hand it up to me... it'll be
easier for you to get out.

It's no trouble, I can get up myself.
Pass it up to me... there's a good boy.

I'm not a good boy!

Give it to me or
you'll make me very angry.

I'm angry already!

Do you think I'm gullible enough
to fall for that old trick?

You ride off with the lamp,
without paying me what you owe me!

It's an insult to my
professional integrity.

You get your lamp
when I get my gold!

You think I'd ride off?
Yes! You've got those shifty eyes!

You cheap street scum!

I resent the word "cheap".

I was going to raise you up...

now I cast you down!

You want the lamp?
Keep it, damn you!

Damn you!

This was a crisis.

And in a crisis, there's nothing
more effective than magic...

Who're you?

Omar Khayyan! I'm the Genie
of the Ring, who else?

Look...

Stamp of authenticity!

But before I answer
anymore questions...

what color was my smoke?

Was it blue? If it was blue, it means
that I am melancholy and sanguine.

That means that I need
more "me" time.

What do you want.
I have enemies, I have a migraine...

What do you think I want...

I want out!

I always about you,
never about me.

Get me out of here,
take me home...

put me out, I'm on fire.

Allah! Allah! We're going to die!
I don't want to die!

Come on, pull yourself together!

Please spare me, I'm only seven
hundred and nineteen years old!

I was going to repent,
I was going on a diet, oh, please...

Get us out of here!

Have you ever heard
of the magic word please?

Because I work for you
doesn't mean you...

can treat me like some sort of
manslave or a eunuch or less than that!

Are we understood?

The light! The light!
I cannot see!

I am blind! It's too bright!

My body is aching!
I shall go home.

Salaam.

I don't understand.

Why would Mustappa pick
the best rogue in all Samarkand...

to get this piece of junk?

It's demeaning!
It must be worth something...

or he wouldn't have gone
to all the trouble.

You're right, son.
Maybe it's a priceless antique.

Don't just stand there
like a leaning tower of jelly!

Talk to him!
Why me?

I'm just a poor,
weak widow-woman!

It's your lamp!

Good evening.

Friend?
Speak up...

insignificant mortal lowly one!

Who are you?
Who am I?

Who am I?

Have you not heard of me?

I am the Lamp Genie!

The Lamp Genie!

Wishes, avarice, dreams, power...

premature and violent death...

Well, scratch the last one.

You're like the Genie of the Ring?

Like the Genie of the Ring?

I who oppose the will of Heaven?

Never!

His powers are as nothing...

as compared to mine!

Are you two related?
No.

Well, maybe. I don't know.
The tests were inconclusive.

What can you do?
What can I do?

What can I do?
I don't know.

How about anything...

for starters?

And that was the beginning of it.

Aladdin, a rogue, a son of a rogue,
from a family of rogues...

found he could have
everything he ever wanted.

All he had to do was ask.

So? So?

So what did he ask for?

We can save that for tomorrow night.
I want to know now!

Not tomorrow night!
It's your fault!

You made the story so gripping
with your wit and your charm and...

and your beauty.

What's my beauty got to do
with story-telling?

Because I lose interest for a moment,
I see your face and I can't leave.

Please tell me
what happened to Aladdin.

Sayid... tomorrow night.
I order you!

It wouldn't be the same story
if I was ordered to tell it.

It's all tricks!
Remember what happened...

to Mustappa when
he lost his temper.

He lost his wonderful lamp.
Tell me!

Tomorrow night!

Chief, now!

Just wait till tomorrow night.

Tomorrow night.

Tomorrow night.

But he wasn't laughing, was he?
No that's right. He wasn't.

I let you live so you could
finish the story of Aladdin...

you should at least get it right.

Now...

there was a storm,
wasn't there?

Yes, there was...

You were saying?

I am your humble and
obedient servant.

What? I didn't get that!

Oh, nothing,
just a mere technicality...

the fine print on my contract,
so to speak.

You have to obey me, don't you?
I, obey you?

I should cast you
into a sea of torment...

I should have you trampled in...

yes, you can have anything
you ever wanted.

How about stopping the rain?

I'm sure there must be another...

wish I can grant your exalted Lord
and Master Aladdin...

I'm in love with
the Princess Zobeide...

...the Caliph's daughter...
Love?

I don't know her, but I've seen
her across a crowded street...

It's usually across a crowded room,
as strange as that may seem.

I want her!
I can give you things, Master Aladdin...

but when it comes to the human
heart, I am powerless.

You can have anything
in the world...

you want and all you
can think of asking for...

is for some young chit of a girl
who isn't good enough for you!

Genie, you can give us things?
You've got it in one, Mother.

Not so much of the "Mother". I'm young
enough to be your granddaughter.

Things, like money...
I've never heard that request before.

You would be the first
to ever ask for that.

Bushels and bushels of money!

With money,
you don't need magic!

Are you sure that's
the way you want to go?

I mean, money is great and all,
but everybody asks for money.

Why not ask for something
new and exciting?

Okay, how about some
sort of flying machine?

What?

A flying machine?

So you could fly all over the world?
You could have drinks...

and someone
could serve us peanuts!

A flying machine! Maybe we should
just stick with the money.

Make way for the lovely
Princess Seleh Alcouz of Souman...

Aladdin's mother put
on an extraordinarily...

vulgar display of wealth...

but as usual, it worked.

We have more petitions,
Your Majesty, they're important.

Your son Gulnare
doesn't think so.

Wake up.
