<i>The thing that astounded me</i>

<i>when I first saw Aspen was
that we had so much room here.</i>

<i>It was an individual utopia.</i>

<i>You could dance to the music
of your own cash register</i>

<i>and then go off to a concert</i>

<i>while your daughter
sat on a rock in the river,</i>

<i>listening to a famous
painter talk about art.</i>

[man 2] <i>It's a lifestyle,
it's freedom.</i>

<i>It's freedom of expression,
freedom of thought,</i>

that we're really
fighting for.

[machinery rumbling]


<i>Aspen had become
a corporate utopia,</i>

<i>a valley of the idle rich.</i>

<i>As the new money poured in,</i>

<i>they didn't want dirty hippies
moving into Aspen</i>

<i>and frightening away
the big spenders.</i>

[cash register dinging]

They are raiding our forest.

<i>They're living like animals.</i>

Mescaline, marijuana,
my good God,

this isn't the way of
American life.

These freaks
will be thrown in jail.

They add nothing to
the Valley and take much.

the greed heads' interest</i>

<i>to grind up the Valley
and sell it for gravel.</i>

<i>But it's not in my interest.</i>

[relaxed rock music]

<i>I'd come to Aspen to
escape politics,</i>

<i>but the bastards had
gone too far.</i>

<i>And so we decided to do
something about it.</i>

[man 3] <i>The next sheriff of
Pitkin County!</i>

[crowd cheering]
[rock music]

Quiet everybody, quiet.
The results are coming in.

Precinct one, Ricks.

a beginner's knowledge</i>

<i>of how to run
a political campaign.</i>

<i>We were like a bunch of
wild-eyed amateur mechanics,</i>

<i>rolling a homemade racing car</i>

<i>onto the track
in Indianapolis.</i>

Hunter, 182.

[crowd cheering]

We just won the DMS, man!

[crowd cheering]


<i>Like a man who had started
some kind of bloody gang fight</i>

<i>by accident.</i>

<i>But when the going gets weird,
the weird turn pro.</i>

[relaxed country music]

[crowd chanting]

My fellow Americans
share with me today

the majesty of this moment.

[music continues]

"Break it up, break it up,</i>

<i>go back to your dorms."</i>

And then they all started
marching or walking towards us

with their bayonets

<i>and from there it
was just chaos.</i>

fired its weapons indiscriminately,</i>

<i>killing four people.</i>

[music continues]

for this fish</i>

and this bounty that we are
about to receive.

And, er, Juan and Hunter
for catching the fish.


Good job, Juan.
Good job, Juan.

Did you have fun?
[Hunter] We had fun.

We saw some raccoons.

What else did we see?

Deer.
[Hunter] Deer.

Too bad we didn't have our gun
when we were fishing, right?

What would we have done
to those deer?

Kill them.
[singsong] Yeah.

deer to die.

They're meat,
but they're animals too.

Mm-hm.
There're humans that's up in their habitat.

I don't understand your logic.
Continue.

They're humans to them,
we're deer to them.

That is a good point.
I like it.

I don't want to kill a nature.

Yeah but you will because
otherwise you'll starve to death.

And then I'll bury you
out there in the woods.

Can we go back to
Frances-cisco?

Juan, this is the most
important piece of advice

I'm ever going to give you.
Okay?

You looking at me?
Right there? In the eyes?

Never move to a big city.

They won't let you take a shit
in your own backyard.

Juan uses the potty, right?

Yeah. I shit in the potty.

[laughs loudly]

Juan with a zinger!

[upbeat music]


"Lax narrative structure needs
more personal involvement."

I guess they want me to become
a goddam parody of myself.


Are you okay? What happened?
[woman] I just threw up.

Well, I pulled out
every single time.

It must be the fish.
[woman sighs]

physically.

Shut up.

I'm going to go down there
tomorrow and

do an investigation.

[pleasant music]

the nightmare of failure</i>

<i>that is gripping America,</i>

<i>the notion of
beating the system</i>

<i>by fighting it gave way to
the numb conviction</i>

<i>that it made more sense in the
long run to flee or to hide</i>

<i>than to fight the bastards</i>

<i>on anything vaguely
resembling their own terms.</i>

<i>We're turning into a nation</i>

<i>of whimpering slaves to fear.</i>

<i>Fear of war, fear of poverty,</i>

<i>and fear of random terrorism.</i>

<i>Fear of getting downsized</i>

<i>or fired because of
the plunging economy.</i>

<i>Fear of getting evicted
for bad debts</i>

<i>or suddenly getting locked up
in a military detention camp</i>

<i>on vague charges of
being a sympathizer.</i>

[cows mooing]

Hey! Your cows are fucking
shitting all over my property!

Eating my lettuce!

It's open range!

Open range?
Wanna keep my cows off of your lawn,

then build a fence!
Hey!

[gun shots]
[shouts indistinctly]

You hear me? Yeah!
[engine revving]

[upbeat music]

[cows mooing]

What will our tourists say

when they hear it
in the news about Aspen?

gained the reputation of being</i>

<i>the hippie capital
of the world.</i>

on our street corners,</i>

exhibitionists running
around our golf course naked,

LSD dealers lurking
behind our schools.

I'll tell you what
they're going to say.

"Next year, we're going to
Vail."

<i>Next time you come to Vail,</i>

<i>you will find new lifts
and new courses,</i>

<i>but the same friendly skiers.</i>

So I don't think the hippies
are bad people

but they are bad for business.

I'm sorry, I have a question.

Do you think of Aspen as a town
or as a commodity?

If you're trying to
make me feel guilty

for promoting
our beautiful town,

it's not going to happen.

It is moral and legal to
sell a good product

and we've got
a good product here, folks.

I don't think the reason that
any of us moved here

was to increase the town's GDP.

Okay. Thank you.

Now I'm very interested to hear
what our sheriff has cooked up

to keep the freeloaders from
setting up shop in this town

and we will all be judging him

come election day.

We don't want a repeat of
the summer of love do we?

[audience shouting]
[Peggy] I don't understand.

Please, please, hey!

How are we supposed to judge him
if he's running unopposed?

That's the last question
I'll take from <i>Aspen Times</i>.

Sheriff, take it away.

[engine revving]
[rock music]

With additional resources,
the help of my wife, and...

some chalk from my kids,

I was able to put together
the map you see in front of you.

It shows illegal campgrounds,

tenement-style apartments located
here, here, here, and there.

There are exactly 844 known
transients in Pitkin County

and all but 50 are jobless.

[engine revving]

And of course,
The Jerome Hotel.

Everybody knows that's where
they're congregating.

Most of the problem's...

Right here.

[engine idling]

[upbeat music]

We're getting soft, sheriff.

We're not tough like
we used to be.

They're coming into our bars
asking for free drinks,

contributing nothing to society.

I told them we don't serve
long hairs in here.

Wrap it up, Ricks.
So I took out old Hickory here

and I gave him a two-handed...
[Eve] Okay. Sheriff...

Put it back, wrap it up.

That's enough, Undersheriff Ricks.
Folks, I'm sorry about that.

Um... what is that smell?

Ladies and gentlemen,
I submit this slag as evidence

that Pitkin Mining Corporation
is sodomizing our river.

And I'd like to know what our local
government is gonna do about it.


This is not on the agenda.
Right. The agenda.

three weeks ahead of time

so we can review it.
Right.

Mine Co. is not
breaking the law.

Well, they're certainly
violating some type of statute.

I mean go up there and
tick around, do your job.

That's not really what a sheriff does.
[Hunter] Why not?

Well, we have a strict purview.

[Eve] Okay, this is not on the agenda.
Strict purview. Purview.

[Eve] Sheriff, please.
Purview.

Mr. Thompson, I'm going to
have to ask you leave.

purview, you mean.

I don't need to go anywhere.
I'm here at a town hall forum

exhibiting my rights...
[Sheriff Whitmire] Undersheriff Ricks,

show this man out.

and get this, okay come and get it.

Seriously?

[audience members shouting]

I'll show you runs
this fucking town, Thompson.

If you're not okay with it
being dumped here,

you shouldn't be okay with it
being dumped in the fucking river!

You pig.
[cell door rattles, bangs]

Burl, loitering, 30 dollar fine,
30 days in jail.

Man, if I knew I was
blocking the sidewalk,

I wouldn't've been standing there.
What'll it be?


Jail it is, Burl.

Del Mar, noise complaint.

30 dollar fine, 30 days in jail.

I was just playing the fiddle.

Very noisily.
That's jail, Del Mar.

Thompson, you made bail.

Oh, yeah.
Right. Peace joker.

Hey, be free.

You know I pay
your goddam salary, Whitmire.

It doesn't get dropped in
your mailbox by a stork.

Well, I don't make the laws,
I just enforce them.

Yeah, that worked real well
at Nuremberg.

[Sheriff Whitmire] All right, Thompson.
[Hunter] Hey, man,

your badge is a shield because you're
supposed to shield us from harm.

All right, Thompson.

So did I make
the front page headlines?

"Hunter Thompson,

people's champion,
ruins janitor's day."

How about, "Today's pig is
tomorrow's bacon."

[country music]

[laughter]
[indistinct chattering]

Peggy, those swine
are running a racket in there.

Yeah. You got so caught up
in national politics

you forgot it's the local stuff
that actually socks you.

I mean, you should've seen
the freaks in that place.

You know, locked up
for absolute bullshit.

Fuckin' playing a fiddle in
public, blocking the sidewalk,

or speaking one's mine at
a town hall meeting.

Yeah. Speaking of that town
hall, if there really are

844 of those freaks
hanging around Aspen,

we might as well
put them to use.

No one's ever needed more than 700
to win an election around here.

You have enough to start
a third party on your hands.

But those freaks can't vote,
they're drifters.

Mm. Colorado law.

Only have to have
lived here for 30 days.

Huh.

This town needs an animal.

Oh, no, hey now...
[Hunter] Whoa.

Benton, you look like you
could use an anchor rope.

Oh, I have plenty of
anchor rope my friend.

Give that a try.
Thank you very much.

Good to see ya, Hunter.

This is fucking awful grass,
man.

What you're tasting, Hunter,
is a little pipe tobacco,

pure pipe tobacco that
I soaked in some PCP.

So don't worry about it, don't worry.
[Hunter] Oh, my God, man.

Don't waste it, don't waste it!
I'm fucking...

just go out of jail, I'm really
not trying to trip right now.

if you just got out of jail...

Here, one more.
[Benton] Come by the studio,

you're hanging out with the pigs...
[mumbling indistinctly]

Come on man. Don't hog it.

Okay.

[film reel clicking]

And two packs of
Dunhill, please.

be paying cash?

No, just put it on my,
um, account.

As per usual.

Hunter, I'm sorry.
Come on.

All right, well then give me the
bag of [indistinct] and the tampon.

Thanks.

What are you doing
playing around with that thing?

I'm a filmmaker.

If you're a filmmaker,
what are you doing

working at the grocery store?

Young Ed Wood?

[ambient music]

[engine revving]

[Sheriff Whitmire, echoing] <i>Exactly
844 known transients in Pitkin County.</i>

[Peggy, echoing] <i>...to win
an election around here.</i>

<i>You have enough
to start a third party.</i>

[Hunter, echoing]
<i>I could be Muhammad Ali.</i>

I could be Muhammad Ali.

I could be Muhammad Ali.

I could be Muhammad Ali.

I could be Muhammad Ali.

I could be Muhammad Ali.

You can get it,
you motherfucker!

I know we can.
Hunter, Hunter, stop. Where have you been?

I was in jail.

You've been in jail?
Why didn't you call me?

They didn't even give me
a phone call.

This Whitmire motherfucker,
Undersheriff,

Dig Nicholas, the whole works.

Fucked me hard.
You're fucked up.

I have news, good news.

<i>Rolling Stone</i> called.

What did they say?

There's a plane ticket waiting
for you at the airport.

You're going to San Francisco.

I don't want to go to
San Fran... cisco.

I want to focus on my book

and I'm gonna just stay here
and work on the book.

You're going to San Francisco.

If you don't, Juan and I are.

are going to San Francisco?

Oh, yeah.
You look like you're bluffing.

You're going.

Of course I am.

[rock music]

[airplane engine roaring]

[upbeat music]

[Hunter] <i>Hey!</i>
[man] Hunter, thanks for coming out.

Jann. John.
It's pronounced "Yann,"

pretty sure you already
knew that.

My son, his name is Juan.

Nice to meet you, Han.
Sit down, man, uh...

How's it going?
Thanks for bringing me out.

I just read the Derby piece.

Love this subjective,
first person,

crazy travelog thing
you got going on.

Yeah? You like it.
What else you been working on?

The last two years...

working on this death of
the American Dream book

and chasing the story,

2,000 pages deep,

I'm in Chicago

and those fucking cops,
they beat the shit out of me so bad,

gave me such a goddamn concussion that
my doctor tells me I can't work on

any more long form journalism.

So I'm writing articles.

Long form, short form.

You can write 500 words.
You can write 5,000.

Just, uh, give me a pitch.

What does Hunter Thompson
want to write?


Why mess with a proven formula?

You could send me
across the country,

spitting venomous
bullshit at all things

that people love and respect.

And I could go to
the Super Bowl, Mardi Gras,

St. Patrick's Day parade,
America's Cup,

the DNC convention,
maybe even Vegas.

The only thing I can guarantee

is that I'll come back with
fear and loathing.

Well um, we're not really
in the business of

sending writers out fishing
with massive expense tabs

hoping they'll catch a story,
you know?

Yeah?
We just can't afford it.

But if we can narrow it down
a bit to something specific...

Well... um...

So you're not into those ideas.

I mean, look.

What about... the weird mechanics
of a hostile takeover bid

of a small town?

What's your angle?

My angle is that
you're looking at

the next Sheriff of
Pitkin County, Colorado.

Oh, well who's going to
vote for you?

Who isn't going to vote for me?

All of your people are
going to vote for me.

The weirdos, the wobblys,
the hippies, the heads,

the bikers, pot heads,
progressives.

Most of all, the freaks.

The freaks?
You should see the freaks.

They're everywhere
and they can vote.

People forget that.

500 bucks for 5,000 words.

Deal.

[soft, upbeat music]

[Hunter yells]

This could change everything. No more
rejection letters, and no more spec articles.

I could become
a full-time columnist.

It's a good idea.

You were right, Sandy.

You were right.

[soft, upbeat funky music]

[engine revving]

How much does the Sheriff make?

8,000 dollars a year.

Okay, so you'd still get
to write things,

like parking tickets.
Oh!

My wife.

My wife with the knife.

[soft, upbeat funky rock music]

â™ª Yeah â™ª

[man vocalizing]

[typewriter clacking]
[upbeat, funky rock music]

Power is our priority.

These swine must be broken,

fucked and driven from the land.

All right, so what's the plan,
Hunter?

We're gonna stop those
ski pants in their tracks.

do, man? The system's rigged.

We don't vote because
there's nothing we can do.

I mean, look what
happened to Kennedy.

[knocking]
Peggy, wake up.

I'm running for Sheriff.

We are going to start
a third party.

God, Hunter.

Sounds like fun.
It sounds like a lot of work.

You're at the bar
all day already.

Hey, I'm here to bail out Joker

and the rest of those freaks.

[typewriter clacking]

You really want to
start a third party

or do you just want to
start a party?

I mean, it's going to be
really fun, but no,

I'm dead fucking serious.

I mean, the house has been
prime for the taking.

It's a crazy plan, Hunter.

It's not a crazy plan.


Joker.

Yeah, brother.

All right, Hunter, what do
you need from me?

I need you to make the posters.

Are you down?
You're really sincere?

I'm sincere.
Come on.

Let's do it.

All right. If you're serious,
I'm in.

[man] You know I'm in.
Good.

Propaganda.
I'm in.

[typewriter clacking]
[soft rock music]

the freak kingdom.</i>

All the decisions we make
should be recorded

and available
in the public library

for anybody to listen to.
No backroom dealing.

Mike has generously
offered the bar

as our campaign headquarters.

And as well as using the bar
for the campaign,

we'll do a Freak Power
Happy Hour.

Freak Power Happy Hour?
[Mike] Yeah.

Yeah, and we'll take
10 percent of that

and throw it into the war chest.

Why do we need money?
Airtime.

I think we can run
this campaign for free.

I think that's the revolution.
[Hunter] No, no, no, no, no.

We need to run propaganda
that will make the fatbacks

fear waking up every morning
and putting on their radio.

Aye, aye.
Yes.

And while we're on the subject
of flogging the noggins,

when I imagine
your campaign poster

I see this giant cyclops owl

with drips coming
out of its face and talons.

You know, I had a dream
the other night

and I pictured a giant
two-thumbed red fist

clenching a peyote button.

Ooh.
[Peggy] Okay. All right.

We have two weeks left until
registration closes.

We need all 844 of our people

to be registered
by October second,

and that's not even
the hard part.

Then we need to get them
to stick around

until November to vote.

And this is the location of all
the freaks in town.

We don't need anyone to
clean up to vote.

They can vote dirty or naked as
long as they turn up.

And do it quietly. We don't want to
scare the boujees into a counter attack.

What are you, in high school?

You can't even vote
until you're 21.

Yeah, but maybe if Hunter wins,

he can get me out of
going to Vietnam.

That's right, Young Wood. Worst case
scenario, I will drive you to Canada.

[upbeat, funky music]

things I've learned out here</i>

<i>is that there are all kinds of
very able people wandering around</i>

<i>with no place to use
their energy.</i>

<i>If we can put this unused
energy to work,</i>

<i>we'll have a hell
of a tool on our hands.</i>

<i>Our movement was
a strange combination</i>

<i>of Woodstock vibrations,
new left activism,</i>

<i>and basic
Jeffersonian democracy</i>

<i>with strong echoes of
the Boston Tea Party ethic.</i>

Three words,
Hunter S. Thompson.

I was wondering
if I could talk to you

about Hunter Thompson's run
for Sheriff of Aspen?

I'm Hunter S. Thompson
and I'm running for Sheriff.

Are you guys interested in
registering to vote?

This blue line represents
the Democratic voters.

We've got 920 of those
registered in Pitkin County

and then 1,102 Republicans.

And as of right now
the Independents

are all the way down
here in the 700s.

These Democrats, man,
they're DOA, okay?

Two party system's out.

Are you guys gonna
register to vote?

I don't know, man.

Voting's just one of those
things that, like,

not everybody does, you know
what I'm sayin'? [chuckles]

So we're starting a new party.
Are you interested in registering to vote?

No? I'm running for Sheriff.
[woman] No.

[man] No, not really into it.
[Hunter] No? You don't want to register?

[man] Not really.
No, sorry.

I'm just here for the party.

Really? All right.
Be a fuckin' slave then.

freaks and weird night people</i>

<i>of every description,
but most of them</i>

<i>would prefer jail or
the bastinado</i>

<i>to the horror of actually
registering to vote.</i>

You got no power,
you're powerless.

All right, keep goin'.

[upbeat, funky music]

[birds chirping]

I got six.
Oh, well,

I got a grand total of four.


I got six, which means an
average of one person an hour.

I mean, what did we think? We were going to
wave a magic wand and get Hunter elected?

We need to shock them out of
their political complacency.

[taser clicking]
[Hunter] A savage and mind-bending campaign

with no quarter given.

Our posters must torture
the outer limits

of political gall.

Our platform so
massively unsuitable

and yet perfectly sensible that
the good citizens of Aspen

will try to rush us
out like lepers

and the most apolitical
drug children

of the most degenerate
outer communes

will come rushing to our defense
saying I must vote.

[taser clicking]
What we need, what we are is Freak Power.

[man] Freak Power.
Freak Power, man.

I think that we should ride
this wave of votes

that you're going to get to do

some creative ballot measures
alongside, you know.

Put an end to this highway
they keep talking about,

or use zoning against
the greed heads for once.

Like generally make it
harder to build

a tar pit next to our river.

You know what would
be really great

is if we could come up with some
kind of ballot measure

that actually got
the long-hairs to show up

and actually pay attention to
that part of the ballot.


<i>Tentative platform, 1970.</i>

<i>We will sod the streets
at once.</i>

<i>Rip up all city streets
with jackhammers</i>

<i>and use the junk
asphalt after melting</i>

<i>to create a huge parking and
auto storage lot</i>

<i>on the outskirts of town.</i>

[motorcycle revving]

<i>We will change the name Aspen</i>

by public referendum
to Fat City.

What for?
To prevent land rapers, greed heads and human jackals

from capitalizing on
the name Aspen.

Young Ed Wood over here will now

be attending
Fat City High School.

Fat City Liquor.
Ski Fat City?

would no longer exist,</i>

<i>and the psychic
alterations of this change</i>

<i>would be massive
in the world of commerce.</i>

Ski Fat City.

[sheep baaing]

<i>Drug sales must be controlled.</i>

<i>My first act as Sheriff
will be to install</i>

<i>on the courthouse lawn,
a bastinado platform</i>

<i>and a set of stocks

<i>dishonest dope dealers

Hunter Thompson's promising
affordable housing

to all locals for life.

He plans on banning
automobiles from downtown.

Aren't you sick of being
harassed by the police?

So do something about it. Vote.

If you get caught with a doobie
twice in Colorado,

they can give you
the death penalty right now.

Cops should never be
armed in public.

<i>of individuals

<i>keep swarming
in here each autumn</i>

So we can count on your vote?
Yeah.

Yeah. I'm... I'm voting
for Hunter.

I'll vote for Hunter.
Sign us up.

I'm voting for Hunter Thompson.

Fat City.
Fat City.


[soft, upbeat funky music]


Um, yes, I have seen 'em.

But I believe it's best
we just leave 'em alone.

He's more trouble than...
Take it down, Carol.

...he's worth. What?
Every last poster, take it down.

Mayor, what you're seeing
in front of you here

is the freedom of speech.
All right, all right. Get out.

I can't hear it. Go.
All right.

Oh. This is a cross-section of
peyote in the center.

Get out, Carol.
All right.

[soft rock music]

Uh, lower.

Keep goin'.

What are you doing?

Oh, 72 of our voters
were disqualified.

Did they tell you why?
Some of them forgot to write their age.

Some of them don't live here.

Someone wrote their
name in as Teepee Bob?

I don't think those are valid reasons.
Okay. Come with me.

I think we should go
to the library.

It's Freak Power Happy Hour.

Yeah. We were just
gonna get drinks.

[insects buzzing]

Parker's squad is in
the library.

Who cares?

It's not their place.
Let's go get 'em.

[Ricks] Show me your hands. Hand up, eyes up.
[cop] Hands!

Oh, is that Thompson?

Peggy.
Ooh, you got us, Ricks.

This is a library for
Aspen residents,

this is not a library for
transient journalists.

You are the corniest man
I've ever met.

You know you can't write, Thompson.
Peggy, what are you doing here?

We're researching a story,
Ricks. You want the front page?

Why are you hanging out with
Peggy so much, Thompson?

Whole towns wondering.
She's my campaign manager.

I mean, are you gonna
arrest us or what?

Let me get back to fucking
reading and doing my job.

If you're resisting, I will.

Resisting?
Come on, man.

Let us get back to work.
Stop wasting our time.

they're doing nothing wrong,

but someday you will be
doing something wrong,

and I will make a point of it.

I am not fuckin' around.

government was in fact designed</i>

<i>for change and it was time we
made us of that very design.</i>

All in all we found 72
disqualified voters.

Excuse me, wait. Excuse me.

Sorry, nope.


a look at this.

Yeah, as you can see here.

you don't need to establish
physical residency in Aspen

nor do you need a valid ID.

And then here it says
very clearly

that any person
who files a frivolous claim

against another
person's right to vote

commits a misdemeanor
in the first degree.

Sheriff Whitmire,
it seems as if you've just

witnessed them commit, uh,

10 first degree
misdemeanors apiece.

Each of which carries a 30-dollar
fine or 30 days in jail.

You get what you want.

You can keep the 72
voters on the rolls

and we'll get on with
business as usual.

No Eve, I can't let you do that.

Folks, you will be arraigned
in two weeks from today

in front of the city magistrate.
Is that understood?


I have stood by you
all these years

and if you think I'm gonna
sit by and let you turn on me,

you've got another thing coming.
This is bullshit, Carol.

Just because it's law doesn't
mean that you have

to follow it if it's stupid.

You've seen these transients
come into our town.

You've seen what they've
done to our youth.

You are no longer fit
to be Sheriff,

and that is why I will resign
and run against you.

What?

Everybody get out of my office.

Now. Everybody out.

Success.

I got it all here.

[soft rock music]

So we got our 72 votes back

and contrary to a lifetime
of experiences,

the law might actually
be on my side.

It's not just the 72.

It's not just the 72.

Ricks is running
against Whitmire.

Those idiots have split the
entire electorate.

Barr any major fuck-ups,
a month from now

we're gonna be running
the town of Aspen.

[typewriter clacking]
[gentle country music]

[people chattering]
[music continues]


Yeah.

And don't come back!

<i>The countdown is on us.</i>

<i>I can feel it,
an iceberg of loose ends</i>

<i>is about to flip over and
dump all these freaks</i>

<i>out of hiding for a national
nervous breakdown</i>

<i>with nothing sacred and
no-holds-barred</i>

<i>and God's mercy on all those
left out in the open.</i>

We're trying to get
together a list

of endorsement for
Hunter Thompson for Sheriff

and put it on the radio.

Uh, would you be up for that?

Hunter Thompson
is the only candidate

who has the imagination
and intelligence

to be a law
enforcement executive.

Elect Hunter Thompson Sheriff.

If you don't want that person
in our government.

We're a clean town
that the tourist

is not afraid to come to Aspen.

If Hunter Thompson wins,

we're gonna have murders here.
[gunshot]

Hit it, Joker.
[razor buzzing]


<i>The nation's freaks are
no longer willing</i>

<i>to stand politely by,
incredulous at the disparity</i>

<i>between what could be done
and what is being done.</i>

So why are you doing this?

For the look on Whitmire's face

when I call him my
long-haired opponent.


Thank you, Joker.

Thanks for bailing me out.

[Hunter grunts]


[man] <i>Savings on...</i>

It's coming on, it's coming on.

All right, here we go,
here we go, here it is.

[man over phone] <i>And this is 10 dollars
for you from all of us at the hospital.</i>

I appreciate that.
Every dollar counts. Thank you.

You guys are doing
great tonight,

and I have a special
guest for you.

Um, come on out.

Hello, Aspen, Pitkin County.
[Eve] Undersheriff...

Thank you, Eve.
[Eve] Yes.

Former Undersheriff Ricks
is joining us.

He is running against
Carol Whitmire

for Sheriff of Pitkin County.

<i>Well thank you Eve for
having me this evening.</i>

<i>I'm very excited.</i>

your plan look like?</i>

<i>Whitmire could not get
the transient,</i>

<i>long-haired hippies
out of town,</i>

<i>but us blue collar men with
our shovels and our pickaxes,</i>

<i>we will promise to
clean this town up.</i>

Oh, dear.
[Ricks] It's an exciting time...

[phone ringing]
Okay. Let's take another call.

[Ricks] ...in Aspen.
<i>Thank you for your support.</i>

Huh-hey, uh, this Bud Screw.

I'm down by the school
handing out Quaalude

to all the kiddies.
[Eve] <i>I'm sorry.</i>

Oh, another one.
[Ricks] That was weird.

Hello?
Hello, Miss Eve?

Um, I found your broomstick
and it reeks of Whitmire.

Peggy Clifford, Aspen Times.

I was wondering, is this
a fundraiser to bail out

your seven friends who were
arrested for election fraud?

Is anyone screening these calls?

That's... that's that
Thompson crew.

This is nonsense.

And I can tell you one thing,
they're not gonna stop at prank calls.

They're going to show up at
the ballot boxes.

<i>We're not gonna take it
in Aspen.</i>

<i>We're not gonna take it
in Pitkin County.</i>

<i>You guys need to show up
and vote.</i>

[phone ringing]

[Eve over phone] <i>Hello?</i>
[in German accent] Hello.

This is Martin Boreman.

[Eve over phone] <i>Thank you
for your call...</i>

[in German accent] I believe the
Undersheriff's plan to form a posse

is the final solution to
Aspen's hippie problem.

What we need is an excuse to
access the weapons

that he is stockpiling.

What we need is a flat out
ding dong riot.

Heil-ho Mire!

[Eve on TV] <i>We're gonna
cut to commercial.</i>

<i>Let's cut to commercial.</i>
[Ricks] <i>It was probably one of those hippies with...</i>

[gentle music]

[man on TV] <i>Hunter Thompson is a
moralist posing as an immoralist.</i>

<i>But Hunter represents
something...</i>

Young Wood!
[crowd cheering]

against him is he's a visionary.</i>

<i>He wants too pure a world.</i>

If this is a joke,
you should drop out.

Now. Like right now.

<i>It's the best of both worlds.</i>

<i>I write the article,
I win Sheriff.</i>

I mean, it's a good
ending to the story.

Trust me.

I do.

Sort of.
Until the wheels fall off.

[Sandy chuckles]
[soft electric guitar strumming]

[soft rock music]


[music continues]

[Sandy chattering indistinctly]

[fire crackling]
[music continues on radio]


Should we shut this party down?

Hunter, you can't
shut this down.

You bought the ticket,
you've gotta take the ride.

There aren't enough freaks to
vote for me to win.

There aren't enough of them.

Freaks are anyone who
isn't making

a million dollars by selling their
neighbor's land out from under them.

It's the good and
respectable folks

who just want to raise
their family here

without being told what to do
by a bunch of corporate suits.

And I have much more in
common with them

than those other people,
you know, I do.

I mean, hunting, freedom,
fucking liberty, justice,

stay the fuck off my property.

Walk into the Red Onion and tell them
exactly what you just said to me because

what they don't realize is
that they're freaks

and if they don't get on board,

their Aspen isn't going to be
around very much longer.

All right, so we hit
the Red Onion,

we hit the retirement homes,
we hit the cowboys,

and we give it to 'em.

I gotta get out of here.

[gentle rock music]

is a far bigger thing</i>

<i>than any ephemeral argument
about peace or drugs or hair.</i>

<i>We're going to deal with
the buggers head on</i>

<i>and on their own turf
and beat them.</i>

What does Freak Power mean?
Is it some kind of code?

Uh, Freak Power, you know,

it's a crude piece of
political theater.

This works, maybe too
well at the expense

of the serious action.

Seizing control of
the government

and returning it to
the hands of the people

who actually live here,
not just the land rapers

and the real estate pimps
who are trying

to sell this town from under us.

Aspen needs to keep growing.

Yeah, but when things move
extremely fast,

they move, you know, recklessly.

As you can see.
Just walk around.

All right, Peggy.

There we go.

Shoo.

An impressive performance,
Mr. Thompson.

Care to comment for the paper?

I'm incredibly high, Peggy.

Oh God, on what?

The notion of
changing the world.


Nice change.
[laughing]

Let's get the fuck outta here.

[upbeat, groovy rock music]

â™ª And what mama told me â™ª

â™ª Papa told me too â™ª

â™ª Yeah my mama told me â™ª

â™ª Papa told me too â™ª

â™ª Well I shouldn't be here â™ª

â™ª Trying to sing these

â™ª Wish I had listened

â™ª Yeah I wouldn't be here tryin'

Hey guys.

Free <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
I want you guys to read this

if you want to know what's
happening to our town.

Heil-ho Mire!

[upbeat, funky rock music]

Man, I think you'd do better
buying all these things up.

Buying them up?

Suppressing my own press?

Censoring myself
in the interest of victory?

Why would you not wait
until the election was over?

No one's going to run an article
about a lost election.

Yeah, but you gave up our whole
campaign strategy here.

This is supposed to
be a campaign

about self-preservation,
not self-promotion.

Well think about it this way,
you know,

in case we lost, you know,
we get our tactics out there

and someone else somewhere,
you know, might...

Anyway, we're not going to lose
and now the world knows.

Hunter, small towns don't like
making headlines.

It only happens when they're
destroyed by tornadoes

or they're inhabited by
mass murderers.

Incorrect. You guys are
absolutely wrong.

Okay. We'll just salvage
the campaign now, shall we?

He let his ego write
this whole thing.

That fascist haircut's
going to his head.

[gentle rock music]

I can run for Sheriff or I can
write an article about it.

I don't understand
what the problem is,

but apparently it had
a negative impact on

the way that people in the town
perceived my intentions.

a fight that you believe in.

I just feel like up until now
you haven't believed in this.

You're right. [grunts]

All right, you can do it,
you bastard.

All right, let's do this.

[tense music]

Contrary to widespread
rumors and a plague

of wishful thinking,
I, Hunter S. Thompson,

am dead serious about
my candidacy for Sheriff

of Pitkin County, Colorado.

<i>The Sheriff's office could be
used to good effect.</i>

To help slow development,
stop pollution

and end consumer fraud.

<i>My aim is to encourage
citizen participation</i>

<i>in government as was advocated
by our founding fathers.</i>

<i>We either have
a participatory democracy,</i>

<i>or a police state.</i>

The only power
we have is the vote.

And as the war rages on
in Vietnam

and as civil rights continue to be a
deep, dark stain on our nation's history,

I believe we can make it work
here in Pitkin County.

[music continues]


I don't know, I mean...
[Hunter] Yeah, I'm really sorry, guys.

I had some bills to pay as
Young Ed Wood knows.

I have a bit of a fuckin' tab
at the, well, everywhere.

And more importantly, I thought
I'd get the story out.

Well it seems like it
worked out, man.

There's volunteers and
reporters from everywhere.

Phones ringing off the hook. We're even
getting cash donations for the war chest.

Really?
[Mike] Yeah.

I'd fucked everything up.

Young Ed Wood!

Listen, if you're going to
be skipping school,

at least capture
the success story.

You still probably want to check
in with Peggy though.

She seems pretty upset.

That article threw her through a loop.
[goat sneezes]

Hey. Hey, Spiro.

Was that a face fart?

[gentle music]

[Hunter mumbling]

<i>Hey.</i>
[taps]

Can you get Peggy?

Get Peggy.

Hey, um, I'm really sorry Peggy.

That was demented behavior
on my behalf, you know?

We should have most definitely
put it to a vote.

It just...
it wasn't yours to sell.

You gave away
our entire strategy.

I fucked up. Can you forgive me?

If you're serious. I mean, do you
really want to make this thing work?

Of course I want to make
this thing work.

Okay well if you do,

we've given away the element of
surprise, so you better ace the debate.

Okay, prison conditions.
What do you think about prison conditions?

They need to learn a craft,
you know, a trade.

You know, construction,
home improvement.

People need to leave prison
better citizens

than when they enter prison.

[soft, funky music]

Dear Lord, let me win
this election.

Let me take back Aspen.

Be there for me,
and I will be there for you.

Um, marijuana.

We're gonna need to
lock up all of

the for-profit drug dealers
and legalize marijuana

and other drugs in general.

I know exactly what he's doing,

what they're all doing.

They're trying to bring in
voters into Aspen

to create some kind of
a communist experiment.

That's what they're doin'.


â™ª I'm lookin' for some justice â™ª

â™ª I just wanna be free â™ª

What about these permits for
the roads downtown?

Fuck roads. We need to return
this town to nature.

Grass is good.

â™ª I seen high, I seen low â™ª

â™ª And I lived
everything in between â™ª

â™ª There's nothing that I know â™ª

Do you think I'm gonna win?

Maybe you might win or
maybe you might not.

I love you.

â™ª And I seen
everything between â™ª

â™ª I keep on going forward â™ª

â™ª 'Cause the only thing
I know is me â™ª

â™ª Maybe it's just a dream â™ª

I'm ready if you guys are.
I'm set.

[man on TV] <i>Presenting live,

<i>When we're under siege,
what we do is we circle the wagons.</i>

<i>That's who we are.</i>

<i>I mean, I've been here
my whole life.</i>

In fact, I used to do this job

with just a flashlight

That's Mine Co.
[audience laughs]

Lookie here, you're about
to elect a man

that calls police officers pigs.

The only pig
in this town is you.

When I become Sheriff,
I will put Thompson in jail,

and that's... that's my promise
to you, Aspen.

All right, Glenn, it's 1970,
not 1870 all right?

We cannot expect people
to have respect

for law and order until
we teach respect

to those we've entrusted to
enforce those laws.

Well, tell me how you're going
to keep the peace

when you're high on marijuana?

<i>I don't really like marijuana.</i>

<i>I much prefer more active
things like acid and mescaline.</i>

So what you're telling
everybody right now

is that you would use mescaline
while you're on duty?

Maybe on the slow nights.
[scattered laughing]

Marijuana laws are
one of those reasons

that have engendered
this lack of respect

that cops complain about
across the country.

<i>You get a whole generation
who grew up felons,</i>

who know the law is ridiculous,

but they're told
all this gibberish

that dope rots your brain and
makes your feet fall off.

[audience laughing]
I mean even the cops know it's a silly law.

<i>But I did ask you a question.</i>

Carol doesn't know
what he's doing.

He wasn't ready for this.

No more land rapes,
busts for flute playing.

<i>Fuck the tourists,
dead-end the highway</i>

<i>and zone the greed heads
out of existence.</i>

Create a town where people
can live like human beings

as opposed to slaves to some
bogus sense of progress

that's driving us all mad.

Oh my goodness. What is Ricks doing?

[crowd chanting]
Drop out, Ricks.

Drop out, Ricks.

[bleeping]
[audience shouting]

[tone beeping]

Okay.

I really don't know about
Mr. Thomson's big ideas

and I don't think they really
concern the Sheriff.

In fact, I don't think he really
wants to be Sheriff,

but I do, so what I say to you

is why don't you play your
games somewhere else?

I think Aspen's ready for it.

Not only for a new
kind of Sheriff,

but a whole new style
of government,

the type of thing
Thomas Jefferson had in mind

when he talked about democracy.

Citizens having a real hand in
shaping their own destiny.

And in this era of the automatic
bureaucratic rebuff,

it may seem radical
or even freaky,

but it is the concept on which
America was founded.

That means this isn't

we need every single last

That lunatic is refusing to let

that 75-year-old woman
cast her ballot

until she shows him her
birth certificate.

[Mike] What?
Fuck. Man, come on.

Jesus.

turn into this.

physically remove him.

I'm sorry, ma'am.

You're a fuckin' mess.
Jesus.

Hey look, your zeal is inspiring

but we're going to have
to replace you.

It's for the best interest.

Wood...
[tranquilizer fires]

Oh! Why did you do that?

You nodded at me to shoot him!

No! I told you to replace as
the fucking poll-watcher, man.

Yeah, man.
Come on.

Get him in the back.

Yeah. Get in there.

Replace the poll-watcher, Wood.

Fuckin' hell.
[Mike] Oh, shit there's...

the fuckin' pigs are here.

Damn. Oink, oink.

Shut the fuck up, man,
or you'll be in trouble.

All right.
Stay in the vehicle, Hunter.

Shut the door.
Stay in the vehicle.

I don't know why
I'm being pulled over.

All I know is that you can pull
someone over if you suspect a crime.

You can't pull me over
hoping to find one.

I got one question.
Have you been drinking, Hunter?

Maybe mescaline, but you'd have
a hard time proving that.

You'd be surprised.

Mike it's not funny.
[laughing]

Who's the guy in the backseat?

Oh, this is our friend.

He's a poet, Alan Ginsburg.

Never heard of him.

Mr. Ginsburg why don't you step
out of the vehicle?

Oh, here we go.

[Sheriff Whitmire]
Yeah, here we go, Hunter.

Come on, Alan. Let's give
the Sheriff an oratory.

Oh, yeah.

[Hunter grunts]

What, is this guy trippin'?
He's just hopped up?


Where the hell is he goin'?

You know, I... I don't think that
was Alan Ginsburg after all.

[Sheriff Whitmire]
Are you not gonna help this man?

He's running around like
a crazy chicken.

He's your friend.

You know, he was a con man,
I'm sure of it.

Good work.

Mr. Ginsburg!

[Hunter and Mike laughing]

that lunatic.

[Hunter] Pigs.
Two birds with one stone.

[Sheriff Whitmire]
Alan Ginsburg!

Alan!

Oh, hell.

That's probably not
even his name.

cached 600 of our voters.</i>

That means we have at least
150 of our Freaks

who have not made it
to the polls yet,

and they close in two hours,
people.

We need to scour
the park benches

or we will lose this thing.

Time to rouse the stragglers
with a blizzard of enthusiasm.

[people chattering]

This is Hunter S. Thompson
and I was wondering

if you were gonna get out
and vote today?

Um...

Yes.

The freaky one.
That would be me.

Well, that's very disappointing.

[people chattering]
[phones ringing]

Mike will be making some grub.

There'll be satchels of brain
rattling drugs for everybody

who wants to end this
on a high note.

[crowd cheering]


There will be a party but please
keep working for now.

I want you working
like coal miners

at a cave-in! [chuckles]

[phones ringing]
[typewriters clacking]

Hey.
What are you guys doing here?

things are going. Have you voted yet?

Voted?
The polls close soon.

Vote. I have to vote.

Come on, Juan, let's go exercise
out constitutional rights.

I'm driving.

Okay. Good idea.

Someone take my cattle prod.

I'm going to vote.

Have you been to the polls yet
this afternoon, sir?

All right, we're down to
the last two hours.

You're going to have to
leave work early

if you want your vote to count.

All right.
Thank you very much.

Thanks for your support.

You don't even have any hair.

I mean you had the craziest
hair in the world.

[Hunter chuckles]

This might be our next Sheriff,
right there.

Hey.
Juan, this is the poll-watcher.

She will be making sure there's
no corruption happening.

How are we doing?
About even.

Wow.
Yeah.

You are?
Excellent. You hear that Juan? We're even.

He is.
Let's go vote.

Good luck, Hunter.

All right, buddy.
We need some privacy.

Here we go.
I know which one to take.

No. First we need to vote.

So who are we gonna vote for?

We've got Ricks.

What do you think about Ricks?

[Juan grumbles]
What about Whitmire? Whitmire?

[Juan grumbles]
What about Hunter Thompson?

Is that the one?
Yeah.

All right, let's vote for him.
But Whitmire I'll steal a cupcake from.

All right, perfect. Here we go.

Voting sticker, buddy.
Ow.

[Juan mumbles]
[Hunter sighs]

In the end,
we're not all that different.

[Hunter and Juan oinking]

[Juan speaking indistinctly]

<i>Okay everyone, phones down.</i>

The polls are now closed.

All right. Thank you all so much
for your hard work.

What's done is done.
Now we wait.

So let the party commence.

[people cheering]
Thank you.

Let's head to the bar!

[people cheering]

Oh.

You realize that we are
actually gonna win big.

Feel this, we're gonna win big!

If we win it'll be by
less than 25 votes.

Politics is addictive.

We must be very careful not to
show any signs of addiction.

I think right now, Hunter, what you
need is another sip of the mescaline.

I do.

That is not what
he needs right now.

Feels good.

Yeah, they believe
we're gonna win.

They believe this is
the start of a movement.

They believe in you, Hunter.

You gotta decide if
you want them

to remember you
for all this or for this.

Yeah, but if it wasn't for this,
I'd be an accountant.

Oh, come on.
But it's true.

Say it enough and you might
end up believing it.

Well, I'm gonna go to my room.

This is worse than waiting
around in the maternity ward.

All right, we'll come get
you when you win.

Sheriff.

[soft, upbeat funky music]

[door slams]
[Benton] Hunter, man, you gotta get out here, man.

[Hunter] Shut up!
[Benton] You gotta get out here.

Come on!
[woman] Come on, Hunter!

[crowd yelling] Hunter! Hunter!


already gearing up</i>

<i>for the presidential
campaign in '72.</i>

<i>They seem to think that
I could beat Nixon handily</i>

<i>with the same kind of
campaign we ran here.</i>

You gotta get out here, man!

[people cheering]
[soft acoustic music]

like Aspen can elect a Sheriff</i>

<i>running on
a Freak Power platform,</i>

<i>then the vote might still
be a viable tool,</i>

<i>and it might still be
possible to alter</i>

<i>the mean, fascist drift
of this nation</i>

<i>without burning it down
in the process.</i>

[rock music]
[people chattering]


There he is.

[people chattering]
[soft, upbeat music]

[people cheering]

[people cheering]

Quiet everybody, quiet.
The results are coming in.

Precinct one, Whitmire 182,

Hunter 210.
[cheering]

And for precinct two,
precinct two, precinct two!

Ricks 23, Whitmire 131,
Hunter 158.


One more, one more,
one more, one more!

precinct three Ricks 10,

Whitmire 137, Hunter 182.
[cheering]


We just won the thing in Aspen!


Relax.

Relax.

Okay, okay, precinct four
precinct four.

Whitmire 204, Hunter 173.

[crowd booing]

Precinct five, 320 for Whitmire,
148 for Hunter.

I think, uh,
it doesn't look good.

Precinct six.

Whitmire 300.

Hunter...

90.

The silent majority.

[Hunter sighs]
Well...

Anyway, they won't have
Hunter S. Thompson

to kick around anymore.



Politics, you know?

[man 2] What do you
think you proved?

I think, um,
I unfortunately proved

what I set out to prove,

which is that um,

the American dream
really is fucked.

No, it's not.

Maybe I didn't prove that.

Maybe I just proved, you know,

there's no place in politics

for a baldheaded lunatic, right?

[film reel rolling]

[Hunter sighs]

We ran the county line

between the necessity for
winning and the weird possibility

that we could win
on our own terms.

And that alone has made
this campaign

worth all of the effort.

All the effort.

I won't dwell on the past

but just to say that

this is the best piece of advice
I'll ever give you:

if you ever get
a chance to sweep

the fat backs off their feet,


don't fuck it up.
[soft music]

[cheering]
[clapping]

[bottle pops]


We won, we won, we won!

people usually get</i>

<i>the kind of
government they deserve</i>

<i>and they deserve
what they get.</i>


party lines didn't really</i>

mean much in this county.

We realized that laws,
we must have laws,

and we've got to obey these laws

and without laws
we've got anarchy.

To Aspen.
To Aspen.

<i>The day after the polls close,</i>

<i>That is one of the key things
I learned in these years</i>

Yeah!

<i>Anybody who thinks that it

the Cook County jail</i>

<i>with a broken nose and
no phone access</i>

stomp your ass in the shower.</i>

<i>That is when you wish
you had voted.</i>
