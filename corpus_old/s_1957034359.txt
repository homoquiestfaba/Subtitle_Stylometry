Everyone have fun!

â™ª

Here we go!

â™ª


â™ª

â™ª

Hello.

Kids! Come here.

Learning to play music isn't just
holding the instrument and playing.

You have to practice certain
exercises, and learn to read music.

I arrived in Cateura in 2006 to
work as an environmental technician.

My job was to work
with families that collect

recyclable materials
from the landfill

and sell them as
their source of income.

They are known as gancheros.

â™ª

My job was to educate them about
better ways to collect and sort garbage.

â™ª

As I began to better understand
the situation of families in Cateura,

I realized that the
future of most kids is

to work with garbage
just like their parents.

â™ª

Here in Paraguay, the social conditions
often limit the ability to dream.

If you're born in the wrong place,
you don't have the right to dream.

â™ª

(demonstrating rhythm)

Count with me.

â™ª

When I was young, music was the first
thing that gave me a sense of purpose.

(rhythmic clapping)

Thus, I decided to teach music
to the children of the gancheros.

Follow my count.
Your mind is wandering.

When I started to offer
music classes in Cateura,

the news that I was offering free
music classes spread very quickly.

And many kids showed up.

More kids than instruments.

(rhythmic clapping)

We did have a few instruments
that people had donated.

But we didn't have enough instruments
for all of the kids that wanted to learn.

(demonstrating rhythm)

And I said to myself, "We have to do
something to get more instruments."

(demonstrating rhythm)

â™ª

However, a community like Cateura
is not a safe place to have a violin.

â™ª

In fact, a violin is worth
more than a house.

â™ª

I met ColÃ¡ when he was working
in the landfill as a ganchero.

â™ª

ColÃ¡ saw that I was teaching music
and one day he approached me.

He told me that he had
experience working in carpentry.

â™ª

Favio asked me, " Do you think we
can make instruments from garbage?"

So I thought about
the idea for a while.

And then Favio brought me a real violin
to see if I could make something similar.

I took all the measurements
and went to look for a metal can.

And I told him, "That's what
I'm going to use to make a violin."

â™ª

It was a continuous
process of trial and error.

â™ª

I asked myself if it was something
that could be used to play music

or if it would be
completely useless.

â™ª

(plucking violin)

â™ª

(playing violin)

â™ª

When I played the first violin, it
was a moment of enlightenment

because we realized that it could
function as a real musical instrument.

Then we figured we could
make other types of instruments.

â™ª

I could use this to make a drum.

â™ª

This drum has an
X-ray for a drum head.

â™ª

I can use this to make a cello.

This weird-looking cello
is made from an oil can,

as well as a wooden
spoon used for cooking.

The tuning pegs are
made from wooden spoons,

a water spigot,

and a size 12 heel
from a women's shoe.

Two nice pieces of wood from a palette that
I can use for a cello, bass, or violin.

â™ª

No one believed that we could make
musical instruments from garbage.

â™ª

But in the end,
we made them all.

â™ª

â™ª

Play using the
top end of the bow.

â™ª

Today is the first day you're playing
this song. You're going to make mistakes.

But don't let that
upset you. Alright?

You have to keep trying until
you get it. Alright, let's start again.

â™ª

In the beginning, I
felt really frustrated

because nothing I played
sounded as good as I wanted it to.

â™ª

Hold on a second.

No.

In a good orchestra, all of
the violins sound the same.

That means you have to
play the same notes in unison.

Your technique is what makes
the instruments sound different.

That's why your
technique is so important.

Let's try it again.

(demonstrating rhythm)

â™ª

One day, my grandmother saw a
flyer for guitar and violin lessons.

And without asking, she
signed me up for classes.

â™ª

I used to dream
of being a singer.

I love music, especially rock music. I'm
a fan of the Beatles and similar groups.

I used to think, " How great
would it be to learn to play music."

Before, if you wanted to study music,
you had to pay for classes in AsunciÃ³n.

â™ª

But then I found this opportunity for
music lessons with recycled instruments.

I never imagined that it would
be free. Especially nowadays.

â™ª

I live with my dad...

with my mom...

with my sister,
and with our pets.

â™ª

You have to cut
all of the knots.

Otherwise it's
hard to work with.

I worked as a ganchero in the landfill
for two years from the age of 16 to 18.

â™ª

In the landfill, I was fortunate to
find lots of different cassette tapes.

One of the best tapes I found

was an album by Phil Collins.

His music was a huge
part of my life back then.

After that, I started to learn about other
music that I didn't even know existed.

Those groups included Led
Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.

This is one of the most important
things that I've taught my daughters.

Musicians from
all over the world.

I have always been interested
in the three great composers.

Mozart,

Sebastian Bach,

Ludwig van Beethoven.

Jimmy Hendrix. Sex Pistols.
Who has never heard of them?

All my life I tried to be part of a
band, or have an instrument to play.

But I never had
that opportunity.

Bye, mom.

â™ª

My closest friends
are the violinists.

Which are MarÃ­a...

â™ª

Natalia...

â™ª

And Tania.

â™ª

My most precious
possession is my violin.

â™ª

I treat it like a jewel.

â™ª

I have other beautiful things like
bracelets, rings, and necklaces.

But I'm starting to pay less
attention to those things.

Now I'm focusing
more on my violin.

â™ª

Hey guys. How are
you? Go on inside.

Hey, how are you Jorge?
Spectacular.

Can I have your
attention for a moment?

Someone heard about our orchestra
and has invited us to play at an event.

That means we have only a few
days until our first performance.

The piece of music that we
will be playing is "Ode to Joy."

Because it's the piece of music
they want to hear that night.

And the main part of the song
will be played by the first violins.

â™ª

Try it again.

â™ª

Much better.

Everyone in the group is unique.

Some of us learn the
music faster than others.

Some of you are very focused, but
others have trouble paying attention.

Those are the
dynamics of a group. Ok?

So we have to help those who have
trouble focusing and learning. Understand?

You must stay focused.

One ice cream
cone each. Just one.

Hold on to that. There you go.

Why did you fool me?

The melancholy
is going to kill me.

And now, without
you, my life is over...

(singing a round)

(radio playing)

(dog barking)


All done? Nice work, MarÃ­a.

Do you like how it looks?
No.

â™ª

Who put the
strings on this violin?

â™ª

The strings are on backwards.

â™ª

Our instruments are out of
tune. We need to tune them again.

â™ª

Are you sure you have the
correct piece of sheet music?

Then what's wrong?

One, two, three and...

(demonstrating music)

No. One more time.
Last time through.

â™ª

Let's give a round of applause

for director Favio ChÃ¡vez and the
Recycled Orchestra from Cateura.

For your enjoyment.

â™ª


â™ª

Just to be on stage at this
point is an accomplishment for us.

â™ª

How well we play is secondary.

â™ª

The challenge we were faced with

is how to convert our small
orchestra of recycled instruments

into an actual
symphonic orchestra.

â™ª

We started to think that
we could play music for real.

â™ª

About 25 years ago, this
creek was clean with white sand.

We used to call it Arroyo
Moroti in the GuaranÃ­ language.

That means "white creek."

We used to wash clothes here.
And kids would bathe in the water.

It's a shame.

When my family moved
here, there was just this creek.

There were no gardens.
There was nothing.

We couldn't plant anything because
when it rained, everything would flood.

We have to plant along the
creek to prevent erosion of the soil.

If you don't build up the
riverbank, your house could flood.

When it rains hard, the
water can reach this high.

But thank God it doesn't
flood here anymore.

â™ª

I'm convinced that the environment
and the deterioration of our surroundings

determines our quality of life.

And I always wanted to
do something about that.

â™ª

I thought I had the answer to the
problem of dealing with garbage.

But reality taught me otherwise.

â™ª

The recycling project that brought
me to Cateura in the first place failed.

â™ª

It failed because you have to change
the entire system beginning at the source.

â™ª

But my failure, as if by magic,

caused me to persist with
the idea of the orchestra.

â™ª

(applause and whistling)

â™ª

â™ª

Ok. Stop. No, no.

â™ª

Ok.

Make the notes rounder.

As a group, we have our first
international presentation in 10 days.

â™ª

We have received an invitation to
perform at the Rio +20 World Summit,

an international conference
related to environmental policy.

We still have a
lot of work to do.

Not just musical improvement
but also emotional preparation.

I don't want to call
anyone out personally.

But preparing for an important event
is not only about learning the music.

You also need to prepare
yourselves personally.

We must develop
proactive attitudes.

Proactive attitudes are the ones
that help accomplish our goals.

So, we need to focus on the actions
that help us achieve positive results.

You all are not like the kids on
the streets, or like any other kid.

Preparing for this trip is
not just about the music.

It's much more than that.

You got it? Help each
other out. We're a team.

Our strength is in our unity.

â™ª

Play louder.

The violinists have the hardest
job out of the entire group.

They need to have a different
attitude than the others in the group.

When they doubt their abilities,
the instrument doesn't sound good.

â™ª

They may not feel confident
about the music they're playing,

but they still need to feel
confident about themselves.

Why aren't you playing?

I am playing.

No you're not.
You're not playing.

Let's play through
it one more time.

â™ª

Oh, no.

Don't be scared to play.

(demonstrates music)

â™ª

Play without fear.
Don't be afraid to play.

â™ª

Tania doesn't really have a
father. He is absent from her home.

â™ª

He abandoned the family. So
she's living with her mother now.

â™ª

Her mom works all day, so Tania
has to take care of her younger siblings.

â™ª

She's like the second
mother of the family.

â™ª

We had a small family problem,
and things weren't so good.

Now I'm living in my aunt's
house. A little distant, but that's all.

I don't see anything
wrong with that.

As a mother, I can tell you that supporting
all of my kids is very difficult.

I'm not always able
to be there for them.

But at least I try to give them advice
about how to take care of themselves.

I used to see Tania walk by my
house, but I didn't know who she was.

Are you going to
take your instrument?

No, it's at the school.

Oh, you have it there.

You look so pretty.

â™ª

I met Tania the day I
started violin classes.

â™ª

I was impressed
by how she played.

â™ª

She inspired me
to play the violin.

I initially wanted
to play the guitar.

But when I saw Tania play the
violin, I also wanted to play it.

â™ª

We could try to practice Monday,
Wednesday and Saturday.

Tania is emotionally closed off.

We can practice
at MarÃ­a's house.

When we ask her about her
life, she won't tell us anything.

â™ª

My best friend is MarÃ­a
because she's a good person.

And she is able to keep secrets.

â™ª

If Tania is around a lot of new
people, she can be very shy.

But once she gets to know
you, she will be your friend.

She's your ally. She's
always looking out for you.

She's a great friend.

(singing melody)


How many girls do we
have? Four? No. There are six.

Remember, these
shirts are for the concert.

What do you think of
this color? Opinions?

Alright. We're done
here. Thank you.

Let's go.

â™ª

This is the first time that
I will fly in an airplane.

It will be my first
time in a hotel.

And it will also be my
first time seeing the ocean.

But the most exciting part is to see a
new country, and be with my friends.

I think all of the clothes
I own will fit in here.

Let me know if you like these.
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

You can't give them to me each
for 450 guaranÃ­? No discount at all?

480 each, right?
Yes.

Alright, let's go. Thank
you sir. See you later.

â™ª

One time MarÃ­a was practicing
violin and left her bow in the bed.

And when I went
to bed I broke it.


What is the gesture that EstÃ©ban
always uses? Something like this...

Favio understands your unique
language and gestures, right?

I think he's almost ready
to publish a new dictionary...

Spanish - EstÃ©ban,
EstÃ©ban - Spanish.

Favio will ask him, " Is
your drum kit ready yet?"

He responds, "Yes, I
just need to..." (gesture)

What he is trying to say is " I
need to turn my kick drum around."


I have a hearing problem.

When I was eight years
old I had the mumps.

It's a disease that affected my
throat here, as well as my inner ear.

He has always been
very hyperactive.

He would play rhythms
on anything he could find.


It's something that
makes me feel free.

It's my personality.

Playing the drums liberates me.

â™ª

We took him to a doctor and he
said he could no longer play drums.

He became very depressed by
this diagnosis. Very depressed.

He didn't want to do anything.

It was like they had stabbed
me with a sword right in the heart.

They told me that I
needed to use a hearing aid.

But I decided to keep
playing the drums.

I don't want my
problem to hold me back.

â™ª

This is our last rehearsal
before our trip to Brazil.

We're making sure all the
instruments are working correctly.

There is still a
lot of work to do.

Before a big event, I
always have trouble sleeping.

Or I have nightmares that
I forget to do something.

Or that there's some
kind of major problem.

I never have enough time to anticipate
all of the challenges that will arise.

I need to double-check all
of the children's documents

to make sure they
are all good to travel.

All of the violins
play an "A."

â™ª

Alright. Let's try it
this time but with effort.

â™ª

First of all, you all are
fighting with the notes.

â™ª

Each note should sound crisp.
But your notes sound muddy.

You're tripping over the notes.

We have been invited to perform,
and there are high expectations of us.

I know we're not big
stars like other groups.

But we still have to
give it our best shot.

This screw is totally stripped.

To be a musician in
the Recycled Orchestra,

you not only have to learn to play
music with these particular instruments,

but you also need to solve the
problems that the instruments always have.

Thus, each member of the orchestra
is both a musician and a luthier.

I'm going to remove the
dents from this instrument.

It needs to be more round,
as close to a circle as possible.

Give it a try with the car jack.

Give it two more turns.


Alright, that's good.

No, I don't want any right now.

Without music, my life
would be meaningless.

â™ª

Here in Paraguay, there is
a very important document

that children need
in order to travel.

Their parents must go to a court

to sign a document

that authorizes their children
to travel to other countries.

â™ª

I'm on the way to
find Tania's father

because he needs to sign the authorization
for Tania to travel to Brazil.

â™ª

Tania's father told me
that if I didn't look for him,

then he would not guarantee that
he would show up to sign the papers.

â™ª

Today is the day that the kids'
parents have to sign the paperwork

because the judge has to meet
with us today, at this very moment.

If Tania's father doesn't show up, then
Tania won't be able to travel to Brazil.

â™ª

I don't remember the
last time I saw my dad.

â™ª

Things were very
rough with Tania's father.

He was very violent with us. He drinks
a lot. And I couldn't take it anymore.

â™ª

That must be
very difficult, Tania.

â™ª

From what I've heard, it's hard for
children who grow up with that situation

to turn out okay in the end.

Is he in the landfill already?

I don't know. You'll
have to go check.

Go ask his boss.

I'm just going to stand by
the entrance to the landfill.

I'll just be here a second
and then I'll leave for town.

â™ª

We'll be right there.

They told me I had
permission to enter the landfill.

I can't find Eugenio.

â™ª

I'll make a call over the radio.

Find out if he's over
there in the landfill.

â™ª

Hi.
I waited for you.

When?
Yesterday.

No, I told you to be here today.

â™ª

Come over here, Eugenio.

Sir, your identification please.

And the identification
of the children.

It's more difficult
working with the

parents than it is with
the kids in Cateura.

Your address, sir?

Sonia JazmÃ­n? Sonia?
Tania. Tania.

Tania, right.
Do you have your ID card?

Go to the fourth window.

â™ª

What's up, mom?

Do you have everything ready?

What else are you
taking with you?

â™ª

I've put too many clothes
in here. Nothing else will fit.

â™ª

(announcer on TV)

â™ª

When the plan takes off,
it's going to shake a lot.

â™ª


But that's normal. And
it's only for a moment.

Would you like to go, Dad?

Yeah, I'd like to go see
the Brazilian women.

â™ª

Bye, Dad.

â™ª

Finally.

â™ª

Nati, where is your side locker?

It's number 5.

If you need soap, the woman at the
front desk said that they have some.

Wow. Check this out.

Come over here and
sit with me in the window.

Five more minutes.

The anxiety I feel
is overwhelming.

I have goosebumps.
I'm excited and nervous.

(announcement over loudspeaker)

Look, don't be nervous. There
are going to be a lot of people here.

Be sure to smile.

The only moments when you need to
be serious are when we finish a song

and we're about to
begin the next one.

Because we don't know
what's going to happen.

I still don't know the order of
the songs we're going to play.

But this is a great opportunity to show
off the orchestra and represent Paraguay.

How does that sound?
Everyone excited?


We play all types of music.

For example, we play classical
music that you've probably heard before.

But I'm sure you've never heard
Mozart played with garbage.

â™ª


â™ª


â™ª

We're going to the beach!
We're going to the beach!

â™ª

(roosters crowing)

What was your first impression when
you saw the ocean? Tell me about it.

I was like, wow.
With my mouth open.

Most people don't get to leave
here. It isn't possible for them to travel.

The experiences you are
having now are wonderful.

It's hard for you all to understand
the magnitude of your experience.

But in the future, this will be an
unforgettable experience for you.

To those who traveled, I wanted to tell
you that the audience enjoyed the concert.

You all played very well.

That's the result of working hard. When
we make sacrifices and are responsible,

we will receive
recognition from the public.

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª

When the video about the story of
our orchestra was posted on the internet,

lots of people around the world
became interested in what we were doing.

We decided to take
you to Cateura tonight.

Not because of the
poverty or the filth,

but because of the incredible
imagination and ingenuity

of the people who live there.

(cheering, applause)

Look at this.

Look at this!

I mean...
That's a fork, people.

Get this, a group of kids in Paraguay
actually made all of the instruments

out of things that
they found in the trash.

'Cause although they
play classical music,

they do it on instruments they've
made completely out of garbage.

The video is having a huge
impact in the world of social media.

(news reporters speaking
in various languages)

â™ª

On one hand, all of this
attention was a good thing.

But on the other it
was a huge challenge.

Because we were thrown into
unknown situations at a frightening speed.

(loud rock music plays)

You like this speaker?

My dad really likes
rock and heavy metal.

We grew up listening
to that type of music.

Here we go!

â™ª

I have always been
a fan of Megadeth.

â™ª

They're like gods to me.

â™ª

I had the idea to take a
picture and send it to them

to let them know that they
have fans in our orchestra.

â™ª

With some other members of the
orchestra who also like Megadeth,

we painted their band name in
the middle of a Paraguayan flag.

We took a picture of us holding
the flag and our recycled instruments.

I posted it on my Facebook page
and shared it on David Ellefson's page.

â™ª

He responded to us, and we
began emailing back and forth.

â™ª

When I heard the story
about the kids in Cateura,

what really hit me was

the human spirit is the
same and connected

all around the world.

Music is a language that
transcends all languages.

When people are
attracted to something,

because it's very organic
and it really touches their heart

or it speaks to their spirits...

And it's certainly how I feel
about going down to Paraguay...

Something that, for
me, it speaks to my heart

and it feels
like it's a calling.

So, this is it. All right.

Meeting Ada, she's
like my hero, you know?

I'm a fan, it's like I'm actually kinda
nervous traveling down here to meet her.

This is a cool moment.


Can you come here?

Where is Ada?

Here she is!

Ada!

How are you? How are you?

How are you?


I'm so excited.

Lots of emotion.

Aw, I know, me too.

Me too.

I can't believe it.

She cannot...
she can't believe it.

She can't believe this.
I know, I can't believe I'm here either.

This is really wonderful.

She... she is my
favorite new rock star.

â™ª

Okay.

David, this is Favio.
Hey, Favio.

Hola, how are you?
Hello, hello, hello!

Glad to meet you.
Thank you, nice to meet you too, yes.

We're going to tour the school.

Wow.

So that's what this
is, it's a school?

(cheering, applause)

How are you?

Hey everyone. Do
you recognize this guy?

(group shouting)
Hey, how are you?

Hola.


I'm a big fan, so...

He is a big fan
of the orchestra.

(scattered applause)

I know that from Facebook.

I've seen that,
yeah, that's the one.

When you started communicating
with the kids via Facebook,

the first thing Ada said was,
" He knows that we exist!"

Just want you to know you've inspired
me for new music moving forward.

So, please continue and
never stop what you're doing.

So, thank you.

(applause, excited chanting)

Stylistically, two
totally different genres,

different instruments,

but the heart is the same.

For me, I would love this to
be something that our band

can continue in some
way, shape, or form.

(chickens clucking,
pigs snorting)

â™ª

ColÃ¡ is such a good person.

That's why I fell
in love with him.

I fell in love because
he's my type of man.

â™ª

We work together and
help each other out.

â™ª

I could never have imagined that things
would turn out as good as they have.

We now have everything we need.

We've been able to
add on to our house.

Even though it's not the prettiest
house, for me it's beautiful.

â™ª

I used to worry all the time
because it gets very hot in the landfill.

ColÃ¡ almost died working there.

â™ª

He was in the hospital
for one month and 22 days.

He got sick from
working in the landfill.

â™ª

But now he doesn't work in the
landfill as a ganchero anymore.

He only goes there to
bring home food for the pigs.

Sometimes he brings home old cans and
metal containers to make his instruments.


I like my work better now

because I'm making
something beautiful

for someone that
loves to play music.

It's an instrument
they can play.

It's something they
will appreciate and love

because what we're
making is a thing of beauty.

I'd like for us to take a
look at some new music

that our friend who just
visited asked us to practice.

I listened to this song on
YouTube. It's a song by Megadeth.

Have you ever heard this song
played with an actual orchestra?

No.

It's likely that they will
play this with an orchestra.

With our orchestra in Denver
in the United States on August 2.

It's very exciting to know I'm
going to play with Megadeth.

It's an unexpected surprise.
It makes me very happy.

â™ª

To play with a rock band and
be recognized internationally,

and to play in
the United States.

That's my dream.

Opportunities like this one are like
a train that passes only once in a life.

You have to take the chance even
though you never feel totally prepared.

This is where you're
going to be playing tonight.

It's a lot different when
all the people get in here.

The energy level
is gonna be way up.

They're going to be
excited and nervous.

When Megadeth gets here,

you guys are gonna
rehearse on stage with them.

Make a right at
this door back here.

So, she's gonna mark
the floor for everybody.

You guys, I want you to be
really aware in that back row.

You're really close to the edge
of the deck, you gotta be careful.

You guys, the band is
gonna come on stage now,

so get into your spots.

We have Ellefson,
where's Mr. Mustaine?

Hi.
Hi.

What's your name, honey?
Tania.

Tania? Okay.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

Very honored to meet you.

Click, click, one,
two, three... right?

Is he hearing you?
He's gonna have that.

He's gonna... we're getting
him some earbuds right now.

So he'll know
that it's coming up.

No, that's no good.

No, no, that's a good pedal.

My pedal broke during the trip.

During the trip, it's broken.

He can... tell him,
he can have mine.

I'm gonna give that...
That's my gift to him.

He can have it, okay?

He said you can have
his pedal. It's a gift to you.

You keep it, all right?

Thank you, thank you very much.
My pleasure, my pleasure.

Thanks for playing with us
tonight, it's gonna be great.

Thank you.
Yeah, no problem.

Do you know how
loud it's gonna be?

(plays guitar riff)

How is the volume for you?

(plays guitar riff)

One, two, three... right? Right?

That's it.
Okay.

â™ª

Don't rush it. Don't rush it.

â™ª

The drummer's nailing it.

Dude, the drummer is
totally throwing down, man.

Wood chips flying.
Yeah.

Just saying watch yourself.

â™ª

Have fun tonight, okay?

â™ª

Hi, hi, hi.

Awesome.
One more time.

â™ª

Have fun tonight, okay?

Thank you.

From South America
to North America,

with the gift of music, let your Holy
Spirit shine through tonight on that stage.

Goosebumps.

All right, let's go do a show!

â™ª

Here we go.

(audience cheering)

Have a great show.

â™ª

They're walking right now.

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª You take a mortal man â™ª

â™ª

â™ª And you put him in control â™ª

â™ª

â™ª Watch him become a god â™ª

â™ª

â™ª Watch people's heads a'roll â™ª

â™ª

â™ª A'roll â™ª

â™ª

â™ª A'roll â™ª

â™ª

â™ª Just like the Pied Piper

â™ª Just like the Pied Piper

led rats through the streets â™ª

â™ª We dance like marionettes

swaying to the symphony â™ª

â™ª Swaying to the symphony â™ª

â™ª Of destruction â™ªâ™ª

(crowd cheers)

Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for them.

Landfill Harmonic
Orchestra from Paraguay.

(crowd cheering)

God bless you guys. Thank
you for coming up here.

We're so proud of you.

â™ª

The Recycled Orchestra,
a group from Paraguay,

made a stop at Saskatchewan this week
to spread entertainment and inspiration.


â™ª

Three shows this weekend,
first one in Winkler today.

Two in Winnipeg tomorrow, and
then they're continuing across Canada.

â™ª

Now they're taking their
spectacle to Amsterdam.

â™ª

Queen Sofia of Spain attended a concert
this morning in Madrid's National Theater.

The concert was performed by the
Recycled Orchestra of Cateura, Paraguay.

So what is it that makes the difference
and allows these kids to be on the stage?

It's opportunity.


â™ª

Please welcome the
Recycled Orchestra of Cateura!


â™ª

I always feel like
I'm living in a dream.

â™ª

But that eventually
I'll wake up.

â™ª

Who would have thought that the Recycled
Orchestra of Cateura would go so far?

They are preparing for a
tour throughout South America

with the heavy
metal group Metallica.

Cateura! Cateura! Cateura!

â™ª

That's when one of the
girls said we touched the sky.

â™ª

(speaking in Spanish)

â™ª

(raindrops plunking)

In Paraguay, major floods have displaced
thousands of people in recent weeks.

According to the
latest count, there are

around 43,000 families
affected in the country.

According to the National Emergency Agency,
this number represents 214,000 refugees.

This is the largest
flood in over 20 years.

Families in Cateura are
being forced from their homes

due to the flooding.

â™ª

The flood refugees are
living in makeshift camps

and in unsafe structures of plywood
and plastic in streets, parks, and plazas.

With the passing of
each hour, the number of

families forced from
their homes increases.

â™ª

Right now, the Cateura
landfill is totally flooded.

This could lead to serious
environmental consequences.

That used to be my house.

â™ª

When the rains began
and the river swelled,

the water level began
rising very quickly.

â™ª

I had to sell all my pigs because
I have nowhere to keep them.

â™ª

That's where my instrument
workshop for the orchestra used to be.

â™ª

My greatest hope at the
moment is the Recycled Orchestra.

â™ª

We had to move like refugees
right next to the landfill.

I was able to save this
can to make a violin.

â™ª

The flood is affecting
everyone here.

My family is being affected...

my relatives...

my friends...

â™ª

And everyone I know
here in my neighborhood.

â™ª

It's really sad to see all of this in our
community where we live and grew up.

â™ª

The majority of the population
doesn't have anywhere to go.

â™ª

There are times when nature
can be so unforgiving with mankind.

â™ª

We're surrounded on all
four sides by rising water.

We are about to be
flooded out of our home.

We have to find a
way to get out of here.

The flood is upsetting me a lot.

When I see all of
the flooded homes...

Especially my own...
it makes me really sad.

To see people in the
streets asking for help.

Those are baby clothes,
sweetheart. For a baby.

â™ª

There are many people that think only
of themselves and aren't willing to help.

It's really tough to
leave your neighborhood

where you were born and grew up.

â™ª

My mom is very
troubled by all this.

She didn't want to
abandon our home.

â™ª

I've lost everything.

I feel helpless. I
don't know what to do.

â™ª

For a while, the
water was rising very

slowly, and then out
of nowhere it rushed in.

â™ª

And that's when I lost hope.

I'll meet you there
on Wednesday, okay?

We're trying to find housing options
for families of kids in the orchestra

who have lost their
homes due to the flood.

As an orchestra, we want to find a
new home for the affected families.

â™ª

When the water recede,
I'll carry everything

to my house by
myself if I have to.

â™ª

No one can say,
"That woman is lazy."

I work hard. I'm a fighter.

I'm a fighter.

I'll never abandon
this neighborhood.

â™ª

What worries me the most is my wife.
She is desperate to return to our house.

I can't sleep at night, so I
pray to God and the Virgin Mary.

â™ª

I pray that the
floodwaters recede.

That winds from the
south blow away the rains.

â™ª

For right now, the orchestra is
allowing us to stay in the school.

If the orchestra had not allowed us to stay
here, we would be living on the streets.

But living on the streets
is not a safe option.

â™ª

In the future, I'd like to find a
permanent home with my family.

â™ª

Good news. The level of the Paraguay
River decreased 3 cm in AsunciÃ³n.

And the water level
has stopped rising.

For the first time since May, the
level of the Paraguay River is not rising.

The floodwaters are
receding due to the

decrease in the level
of the Paraguay River.

â™ª

The floodwaters were very
close to reaching my house.

But we were very fortunate,
and our house did not flood.

After nearly two and a half
months, the floodwaters are receding.

Families are moving
back to their homes.

This entire area is
starting to come back to life.

â™ª

â™ª

We're going to do whatever it takes to
rebuild our homes and our neighborhood.

â™ª

I'll fight to the end.

â™ª

Let's take down
the " For Sale" sign.

Hold the ladder for me.
Don't worry, I got it.

Take this. It's for you to keep.

The idea is for several families from
the orchestra to move here to live.

The plan is for you
to move here directly.

You won't be going
back to your old house.

Do you agree with that plan?

I'm always going to be by her
side. I'll always support and help her.

Over there you can see the
landfill. And there is ColÃ¡'s house.

â™ª


â™ª

Alright, let's see
what the problem is.

We'll get this fixed in no time.

Since we started making the instruments,
everyone in the neighborhood knows me.

Kids say to me, " Don ColÃ¡,
can you make me a violin?"

It makes me happy that all the kids
know who I am, and they appreciate me.

â™ª

There you go. All fixed.

Thank you, Don Cola.

Thank you. Don't forget
your bow, little fella.

(softly playing violin)

Very good. Just the last few
notes. Everyone play together now.

(all playing together)

Let's try it again.

(all continue playing)

â™ª

My dream is to become a
professional violin teacher.

I want to have lots of students
here from the community

and give them the opportunity
to dream like I have had.

â™ª

In the future I'd like to be
a professional musician.

I don't see myself
doing anything else.

â™ª

During all these years
with the orchestra,

I've learned to value my friends, family,
and those who support what we are doing.

Who can help me hang this tarp?

â™ª

We need to spread it
out and tie it up somehow.

â™ª

Use the wire to
hang it up there.

â™ª

Be careful, ColÃ¡!

â™ª

Done.

â™ª

I bet they ate all the food.
We'll be the scavengers.

That's plenty.

Manioca?
Yes.

â™ª

Just to let you all know,
I'm not going to cry.

â™ª

I'm not going to cry.

Happy Birthday to
you! Tania! Tania!

â™ª

No! You're going to make me cry!

(clapping and singing continues)

â™ª

Music is a unifying force.

If you have talent,
and you work hard,

it is possible to fulfill
your dreams in life.

Hello, good evening.

My name is Favio ChÃ¡vez.

I am the Recycled Instrument
Orchestra of Cateura conductor.

Sorry my English finito.


Good evening. It's a
pleasure to be here.

Our goal is to show that
culture is a basic human need.

That music can change lives.

And even when we live in the
most unfavorable conditions,

we must never stop dreaming.

To have nothing is not
an excuse to do nothing.

Thank you very much.


â™ª

(cheering, applause)

â™ª

(singing in Spanish)

â™ª

â™ª In the heart

of our music â™ª

â™ª There are echoes
each of us brings â™ª

â™ª And the song of the world

runs through us
all when we sing â™ª

â™ª Gives life to everything â™ª

â™ª Cateura â™ª

â™ª Come with me now â™ª

â™ª Cateura â™ª

â™ª Oh, how we will sing â™ª

â™ª Cateura â™ª

â™ª You gave us music â™ª

â™ª We give back the dream â™ªâ™ª

(singing in Spanish)
