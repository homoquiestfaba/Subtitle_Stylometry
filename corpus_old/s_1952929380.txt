man: For some it has been
given to know

the secrets of
the kingdom of heaven.

But for others,
they are in parables.

Breakfast!

( water running )

Phillip!

You look nice.

That's because
I'm going to church.

I'm not going.

It's my only day off.

Are you gonna
come down here

and have a civilized breakfast
with your son?

I'll go get him.
Thank you.

Dad!

man: You know how you can feel
what's bothering someone

just by looking at 'em?

Dad?

( blowing raspberry )

That was Phillip.

â™ª Those that can't
quite function â™ª

â™ª In society at large â™ª

â™ª They're going to
wake up on this morning â™ª

â™ª And find that they're
in charge â™ª

â™ª But those
the world's set up for â™ª

â™ª Who are really doing
quite well â™ª

â™ª They're going to

â™ª Today was

â™ª Molecules decide to change

â™ª Laws of physics

â™ª And youthful

â™ª Yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª Today was

â™ª Oh no â™ª

â™ª Not just another day â™ª

â™ª Today was supposed to be

Mom?

( weeping )

Oh, God.

Sorry.

( crying )

I can't do it.

woman: So the sex is not
mixed up with love or intimacy

or emotions or connections

or any of that kind of
bullshit.

I mean, that notion of love
is so pre-Gloria Steinem.

It's so 1950s
"mother's little helper,

bake me a pound cake in
Gary, Indiana."

woman: Jamie, I know.

I mean, for fuck's sakes,
I am a liberated woman here.

I am a postmillennial girl.

Having sex is not something
I should be made

to feel guilty about.

I mean, men don't feel bad
about it when they do it,

so why should I?

Jamie, you're so right.

( ding )

( moaning )

Okay.

Well...

Thank you.

Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

You're welcome.

Yeah.
Or...

I'm sorry, thank you.

That was, um...
that was fine.

So what are you doing later?

It was nice to have
met you.

( sighing )

man: It ain't always easy to
see the upside of shit.

man: Welcome to
the Bordasch/Newman Agency.

Thanks for joining our
focus-group family.

Today your moderator is Fred.

What we have is a market-
prototype presentation.

It's a mockup,
it's not a finished commercial.

What we're doing and what we
need your help with

is to figure out

how what you see
on the television screen

makes you feel, okay?

And don't pay any attention
to the cameras.

Our writers are just
observing your reactions

and that's why on the piece of
paper that I gave you,

under the heading,
"My thoughts,"

we want you to
write your thoughts.

Okay?

So let's start.

man: Holzhammer Chowder.

Phillip Katz.

V-2-6-3-F.

Sex doesn't have to be
confused by love or intimacy

or emotions or connections.

Men don't feel bad about it
when they do it.

So why should you?

Mmm...

Holzhammer's Clam Chowder!

Mm-hmm!

Holzhammer's Clam Chowder.

Tastes like
a bowl of heaven.

Holzhammer's Clam Chowder.

Tastes like
heaven in a bowl.

All right.

Don't forget to indicate which
catchphrase appeals to you.

Phillip Katz,
I think you have what it takes

to be a Clio Award winner!

But you're not there yet.

Take for instance this
commercial you did today.

It's fun, it's zany,
it has a hook.

But...

what exactly are you trying
to say to the world?

What am I trying to
say to the world?

Phil, tonight, I'm gonna
ask you to do something.

I want you to stay here
in this revered firm,

in this historic
downtown building.

I want you to formulate and
fulminate and fabricate.

I want you to dream
fruitful dreams all night long,

until you come up with
exactly what you,

Phillip Katz, junior
copywriter extraordinaire,

wants to tell the world--

What you want to
tell the world.

About?

Clam chowder?

Resolve the pitch.

Taste the creamiest chowder.

Holzhammer's.

Taste some creamy
clam chowder.

( phone ringing )

This is Phillip.

Mrs. Katz: I don't think
it's healthy

for you to go
back to work so soon.

Hi, Mom, how are you?
I made dinner

and I don't appreciate you
letting it get cold.

Phillip: Pestering a chowder,

the nagging chowder.
Hello?

Are you there?
Yeah.

Hello?

Yeah, I'm here.

Your father
didn't satisfy me.

He never did.

( dial tone )

â™ª Come, come like sugar
my love â™ª

man: Tippy, a furry
gerbil that talks.

Everyone loves talking
rodents.

More talking gerbil.

Mmm...

â™ª These images
that burn my eyes â™ª

â™ª Like the thumb prints
of the sun â™ª

â™ª Oh sugar pill â™ª

â™ª I believe you â™ª

â™ª Oh sugar pill â™ª

â™ª I wanna
eat you up â™ª

â™ª Up, up... â™ª

It made your father jealous...

... that I was gonna be
a professional.

I left school for him

so he wouldn't feel
so bad about himself.

Now look.

â™ª Now I am blissed out â™ª

â™ª I have
kaleidoscope eyes â™ª

â™ª I'm light as cotton â™ª

â™ª I am wide
as the sky â™ª

â™ª This is where
my thoughts come to die â™ª

â™ª And I am happy â™ª
( alarm clock beeping )

â™ª Oh sugar pill â™ª

â™ª Oh sugar pill
oh sugar... â™ªâ™ª

man: Our paths crossed
only once,

but we both had a profound
effect on each other.

See, most people,
they just walk by,

nobody even looks you
in the eye anymore.

And they all
say the same thing...

"I'll get you on
the way out."

Are those helping you?

Excuse me?

The pills.

What needs of yours are
being met by taking them?

Needs?

Uh...

My mom's doctor
gave them to me.

Bingo.

Tell the man what he won.

( chuckling )

Do you see the difference
between the question

I asked you
and the answer I got?

I asked you what needs
are being met

and you told me your
mother's physician said

that they were
"permittable."

Hey, lady!

It's not what you are,
it's who you are.

I want to see your
shoulders back and your chin up

the next time you
walk by here

so I know that you're
thinking better of yourself.

( chuckling )

Ha-ha.

You talk like that
to everyone?

Only my disciples.

Wanna enlist?

( change rattling )

Uh...

I don't have any change.

Let me get you
on the way out.

My message was not intended
to guilt you

into acting charitable.

Yeah, if we--

You and I can empathize,

if I can tell you how your
actions impact my needs.

Let me get my coffee
and I'll take care of you.

Thanks-- thanks.

You ought to
loosen up that tie.

You wear it like a noose.

The only truth
is your own truth!

A noose?

My... my father just--
he just--

He just hung himself.

Congratulations.

woman on TV:
Sorry to interrupt

your regular scheduled
programming,

but we have breaking news
here at the Channel 8 desk.

Channel 8, hard news 24/7.

What we are hearing
unofficially

is that they are
predicting the sun

has anywhere from one week to
six months of hydrogen left...

Phillip?

... before it runs out of fuel
and collapses

onto itself completely.
Phillip Katz?

Do you want a receipt?
They have been furiously

making calculations
about the amount of hydrogen

Ieft at the core of the sun
and it does not--

The sun's dying,
you wanna fuck?

( tape rewinding )

Do you want a receipt?

Yeah.

What did you mean by
"congratulations"?

Where are my manners?

Gabe.

Phillip Katz.

What's alive in you, brother?
Huh?

You see, I used to be
a divorce attorney,

pulling people apart

when I could have been
putting them together.

Y'know, what I meant is that
we are all born preloaded

with the tragedy
of our parents dying.

The worst is over.

You're halfway home.

Well, now you don't
have to worry about

what he thought about you,

how he made you feel,
what he taught you,

how he punished you.

What the fuck
did he know anyway?

He took the easy way out.

Now you can be your own man
and look to yourself.

( humming sustained pitch )

That's the $10 version.

Out of this event,

out of this grief,
out of this mourning,

from this corner on,

you will be known to us as

Son of Morning!

Thanks for taking the time to
connect with me.

Now go and be the change

you wish to
see in this world.

( dog barking )

Oh...

man: Returning now to
a Channel 5 special report.

Welcome back to our continuing
coverage of Planetary Panic.

We know you've got a lot
of options to choose from

here in
the South Florida area...

( multiple TVs blaring )

woman on TV: If it were
only for this

Earth would probably be
spared, but new research...

man on TV:... begin when the
core temperature reaches

around 100 million Kelvins.

Waves and extreme
rainfall events,

floods, possibly
wind events, like storms.

More bad news
for the ailing sun,

this time out of Belgium.

Climate models predict that
over the next five days,

we are likely to see a rise
in global average temperatures

of maybe 1 or 1 Â½

... all report severe
disruptions

in cellular service today,

responsible for global system
mobile communication...

Mom?

I've taken a job
at a coffee shop.

Do you think you're
gonna be okay?

I have nobody.

There's a special
prayer service for the sun.

I can't go.

I need you to come with me.

In layman's terms,
if you would, please, sir,

tell us a little bit about
the mechanics

of what's going on
with the sun right now.

Well, Jim, there comes a time
in the life cycle of every star

when man...

Each man must
ask his Father,

his Holy Father,

to forgive him his sins

and to forgive us
the sins of humanity,

to quench the fiery storm above

and relieve us
of the dangers of the vacuum

of His might.

God has forgotten us,

abandoned us
because we have forgotten Him.

We have abandoned Him.

God has forgotten you

because you
have forgotten Him

and because you,
my children,

have abandoned His church.

All He asks of us,
all He asks...

Clam chowder?

... is more talking gerbil.

( speaking in
foreign language )

( screaming )

( chanting in Latin )

Holy...

( all shouting )

Stop that!

This is a church!

Phillip!

I'm in a church in Boca.

I have a breaking story.

I'm gonna get an interview
and this is gonna be big!

This one's for you.

man on TV: Sorry to interrupt,
but it looks like

we have some
breaking news for you

in an exclusive report
from Channel 5

entertainment reporter
Josephine Tuttle in Boca Raton.

Josephine: In 1858, it was
Lourdes, France,

where Bernadette Soubirous saw
the Virgin Mary 18 times.

On October 13, 1917,

it was Portugal where hundreds
of spectators

claimed to have seen
Our Lady of FÃ tima in the sky.

Now, almost 90 years later,
another miracle has occurred,

this time in the exclusive
South Florida resort town

of Boca Raton.

Welcome.

My name is Thomas.

I'll be your concierge

for the duration
of your stay with us.

Josephine: There was
pandemonium inside

the Third Nicene Church
of Boca Raton

where tears of, yes, blood

flowed not from the eyes
of the Virgin Mary statue

but from an actual
congregation member

known for the moment only as
"Phillip. "

Come on, come on,
come on...

Members of the small
ecumenical congregation

came out today to pray for
the health of the sun,

but what they found was
an entirely different

kind of "son" altogether.

This was the scene
just hours ago,

a fervor of hysteria
to see, touch and hear

the man that many are already
calling a modern-day messiah.

( siren blaring )

Sorry, sir,
are you still resting?

No.

Am I in a hotel?

That you are.

The owner should be arriving
in town a week Thursday.

He'd very much like to
come up for a meet and greet,

probably be accompanied
by his usual

coterie of
derelict child stars

and strung-out
supermodels.

Should be mildly amusing.

He's footing the bill, so...

You've received
a great number of gifts.

Just here in the living room.

Oh, my God.

Most of them are from fans.

There are a few
from corporate sponsors

wanting endorsements,
no doubt.

And there's a delegation
from the governor's office

that wants
to meet with you.

What's going on?
Sir?

What is this?

What is what?

This-- this real?

This is real?

Well, I suppose that really
depends on your

definition of reality.

If that's all,
sir, have a blessed day.

And you might stay away
from the windows.

The Romans
are growing restless.

They're running low on bread.

And you are, as I'm sure
you've realized by now,

the circus.

( gasping )

( doorbell ringing )

( knocking )

I'm sorry, are you
in the middle of a bath?

I can wait outside
until you're done.

Atmospheric.

You like it
atmospheric, huh?

Who are you?
Josephine.

Oh, I'm Phillip.

I know.

Did you arrange all this?
I did.

I just happened to
be at the church,

praying for that sun thing,
or against it.

Whatever.

You understand.
So you saw what happened.

I did, I saw
what happened to you

and I realized immediately

that you were gonna need
a friend,

someone to insulate
you from the wolves

and the succubi.

Hi, Mrs. Katz.

I'm David
from Alchemy Talent.

You spoke to my assistant.

Flew in from the coast on the
first red-eye I could catch.

Can I come in and talk?

Sure.

Great.

This is Chad and Jim.

Could they come in, too?

Josephine: I want you to
be able to trust me.

There's gonna be many other
so-called news journalists

and they're
gonna promise you things:

money, trust, confidentiality.

They'd even do things,
sexual things.

They're all whores.

I was at the church
with you, praying.

I was touched...

... by what you did.

I appreciate all this,
I really do, it's amazing.

I just don't think that what
they say about me is--

I just think
that the blood...

The blood.

... from my eye,

I think it was
because I stopped taking

my stress medication.

Oh.

That was not stress.

That was not the result of not
taking stress pills.

Forget about those pills.

Don't ever mention those
pills again, ever, to anyone.

Okay, I-- I--
I am pretty sure

that I'm not what
they think I am.

I'm pretty sure
I'm not what you think.

I want to help you.

I want to do a one-hour

exclusive in-studio
interview with you.

Just you and me.

And the lighting guy.

The sound guy, the cameraman
and the grips.

Just you getting
your message across.

You'll have to pull up
your breeches

and you have to
grow some balls

and just accept your destiny.

Mmm.

Mmm... this is
delicious cheese.

Mrs. Katz, we've done
a little research.

We know about the refinancing.

We know about the second and
third mortgages on this house.

I told him.

I'm not good at finances.

I told him.

What am I, an economist?

Mrs. Katz.

Mrs. Katz.
Mrs. Katz.

Your husband also left a
sizable debt in his business.

I warned him
every day for years,

but he never listened to me.

Nope.

Your student loans
are out of control.

Five graduate degrees.

A Master's in Ornithology.

What is that, even?

Birds.

You are the king now

and the people deserve to
know what their king

is dreaming
about, don't they?

I've been having a dream.

Huh.
Mmm, mmm...

Actually, I've been having it
over and over again.

What is that, Brie?

Maybe you're right.

Of course I am.

About what?

Maybe my dream has some
significance for the world.

I'm sure it's very important.

All told, you're down,
give or take,

about a half
a million dollars.

I did the best I could.

If I could get ahold
of your son...

If you could convince
Phillip to sign with us.

Mrs. Katz.
Mrs. Katz.

Mrs. Katz.

We're gonna let people
know who you are,

what you've done,
what you're going to do.

Mrs. Katz.

Mrs. Katz.
Mrs. Katz.

You'd be out of debt
by the end of the month.

So I don't want to
pressure you,

but I need to let my
boss know in the next hour

or he's probably
gonna fire me.

Do we have a deal?
Do we have a deal?

man: In response to the rapidly
escalating situation,

an emergency multinational
conference of astronomers,

astrophysicists, and...

Is he the son of God, or...
He is the son of God.

I think he's the son of
the son of God, no?

Grandson of God.
Yeah, that works.

So that's what
we're gonna go with?

He's the grandson of God,
then, because--

No, that or we can
just stay with "messiah,"

if that makes it easier.

It's up to you--
I think that's better.

I think that "grandson,"
it limits

the audience potential
in terms of demographics.

Oh, fine.

Great, we're sticking with
"messiah" then, perfect.

Laurel, looking forward
to your story next week.

Next week?

Are we even gonna be
alive next week?

Has anyone heard
anything about the sun?

Have you all forgotten about
the fact that the sun

is about to turn into

a massive
fucking vacuum cleaner?

I told you before, if you
can't control this sun thing,

I'm gonna yank you

and replace you
with the weekend girl.

All right, boys.

Sandy.

Henchy.

Gentlemen... Iet's dance.

You ready?

I can do that.

Okay, what we need
out of him for sidebars,

has he performed any miracles
that we don't know about?

Has he been arrested,
misdemeanors or fines?

Does he have a girlfriend?

Is he gay, does he have
a gay lover, if so, who?

Josephine, this is Frederick.
Hold on.

Frederick.

... the network decided
to carry the interview.

Nice work.

The network's decided
to pick up the feed.

Phillip, you're gonna become
a nationwide phenomenon,

bigger than Je--

Bigger than The Beatles.

Oh, my God.

man: Counting down.

Ten... nine...

Woo!

This is gonna be huge.

Is this not
gonna be great, huh?

I love that kid, I goddamn
love that kid, right?

( tone ringing )

Now that you
have the spotlight,

the attention of the people,

what is the message that
you'd like to get across?

What is it that you'd like
to say to the world?

Yeah.

( chuckling )

Look at him, there he is.

That's God.

What you feel,
what you really feel.

It's a complete
and total clusterfuck.

Next question,
go to the next question!

Josephine, go to the next
question, please.

You've chosen to reveal
yourself here in South Florida.

What made you choose this
particular locale

for your cotillion?

Did she just say
his cotillion?

Say something!

Say something,
you ruinous prick!

There's been a lot of
speculation,

particularly in
the blogosphere,

that you've come to the Earth
to make some sort of sacrifice

for the sun so that
it doesn't die.

( phone ringing )

Channel 5.

It's his mom.
Are you crazy?

I'm not gonna put
that idiot's mother

on live national television!

Hey, remember that guy
I fucked the other day?

At the coast bar?

Say something.

Patch her through.

His mom.

His mom.

What?

The messiah's mother.

Messiah's mother!

Messiah's mother!
What?

The fucking messiah's mother's
on the phone!

Uh-oh!

Phillip.

Phillip, I don't
think it's fair

you get to have all the fun.

Mrs. Katz--

Phillip, there are hundreds
of people outside our house

holding candles.

They keep asking me
if I'm a virgin.

I'm a widow!

Push into his eyes.

( chanting in Latin )

( sighing )

â™ª No one's famous â™ª

â™ª We're all strangers â™ª

â™ª Now I can't even
talk to you â™ª

â™ª No one's famous â™ª

( phone ringing )

Hello?
Mrs. Katz.

I have David from
Alchemy Talent for you.

David?

I'm surrounded.

They won't leave.

Hi, this is David.

David, what do these
people want from me?

Hello?

I have David.

David?

Yeah, hi, I'm here, hi.

I-- I called him
on the phone,

I did what you said.

Mrs. Katz.

Mrs. Katz,
you need to go to him.

He's your son and this
is his time of need.

Also, I pitched him
really hard at the staff lunch

and it could not have
gone better.

Go to him,
go to him, Mrs. Katz.

Go to him and make
him understand

what he needs to understand.

Oh, I gotta take this.

All right,
let me know how it goes.

David?

( group applauding )

The governor asked me to
come down here today,

meet with you

and figure out
what we have in common

and see how we might be able
to work together

over the course of
the next couple months

before the election rears
its ugly little head...

yeah...

to see what you
want to accomplish

and to let you know
a little bit about

what we're looking to do.

Sounds good.

If there was one thing--
policy-wise,

you understand, policy-wise--

if there was one thing
that we could do to help you,

to help get you on our side,

what would that
one thing be?

Uh, one thing?

Yeah, policy-wise,
I'm talking, policy-wise.

Whatever you want us to do to
help you with this--

You know, the thing
that you're doing to--

to help the... sun.

The sun?

We're talking about things
like stem-cell research,

fetus rights,
oil drilling, gay marriage,

that kind of thing.

See, we are willing
to go far for you.

We're willing to go
very far, very far.

I mean, we'll even reverse
suffrage if you want.

( chuckling )

Well, one thing...

policy-wise,

that-- that--
that I would want--

In my district,
people are concerned about

prisoner recidivism.

Is that
a concern of yours?

Yes.

Are you pro-life
or pro-choice?

Do you like babies?

Yes.

Yes, yes!

He's pro-life.

Somebody write that down.

Now, Mr. Katz, all we're
looking to get from you

in return, of course,

is your endorsement
for the midterms.

( knocking )

Sir, do you
have a minute?

Bob, I'll call you back.

What's up?

There's someone
I think you'll wanna meet.

Send her in.

Thank you.

All right.

Let me hear your story.

Well, it all
started in a bar.

man: Good afternoon,
Palm Royale.

Hello, I'm Gabe.

How are you doing?

How may I
direct the call?

Thank you for taking the time
to connect with me.

I have an urgent
need to connect with

my good friend,
Phillip Katz.

Phillip Katz,
transferring now.

Thank you.

( ringing )

( beeping )

Hello?

Hello?

Phillip, it's me, Gabe.

You didn't
forget me, did you?

Thomas: Due to the volume
of calls,

the messiah will not be able to
personally attend to your wish.

Please accept the messiah's
gratitude for your call

and have a blessed day.

( dial tone )

Hello?

Hello?

man on TV:
... 80%f the world,

what many people are
describing

as a good old-fashioned
miracle.

It seems that with everyone's
eyes and ears on Phillip Katz,

the sun has continued puzzling
astrophysicists

as to what this latest
release of radiation means.

Scientists the world over are
going back and forth

about whether
the sun's core

is shrinking or expanding.

One thing is certain,
the sun is very unstable.

There are no precedents
for these reasons.

It seems all we can do is pray

and hope that our new messiah
has some ideas of his own

about stabilizing the sun.

Maria?

Maria: Theological experts
worldwide

are poring over the
copywriter's past work

significance of anything

for condensed oatmeal.

man: All right, thanks, Maria.

Some of you might recognize
Maria Sanchez

from the weekend desk.

She'll be taking over duties
from long-time anchor

Laurel Sanders,
who's on personal leave.

Your indulgences
have arrived, sir.

These came in
the mail.

They're from Asia.

Really?

How exotic, sir.

There you are.

I hope you're
puckish, sir.

This may tide you over.
Thank you, Thomas.

Bon appÃ©tit.

man on TV:... trying to
catch a glimpse

of our savior-- Josephine?

Josephine: Tom, the crowds
outside of this historic hotel

have not subsided.

Anything else for you, sir?

Thomas.
Your Grace?

She looks so sad.

No one is giving up hope.

Maybe I can help her.

Phillip, Phillip, Phillip!

Hi, how are you?
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

I'll leave you to it,
then, shall I?

I'm Phillip.

( screaming )

Are you all right?

Sorry.

No, no, don't worry.

It's fine.

I like your shirt.

( screaming )

I saw you on
the news and I--

You were very beautiful

and you looked like
you were troubled

or upset for some reason.

And I thought maybe you'd
want to come up here and chat.

What can I do for you?

Bleed on me.

( thundering )

I've been having this
recurring dream about the sea.

It's one of those lucid dreams
people talk about,

Iike, when you're
awake within your own dream

and you know it's a dream,

but you know you're
awake in the dream.

I can't figure out
what it means.

People seem to think
that this dream

might have some
significance for the world.

Maybe for the sun thing.

Would it be okay if
I invite some friends over?

Sure.

man: Mr. Katz, it's about
the endorsement.

We are prepared to
offer you $5 million.

That's weird...

woman: Where's the motion...

( phone ringing )

St. Mary.
Who?

Sir?

St. Mary of
the Catholic Church.

I've never heard of her.

( phone ringing )

woman: Then after 1:30, you have
a meeting with the ambassador.

Then at 4:00, you have tea
with Prince Harry,

followed by...

Jesus, fuck, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

â™ª Well our mamas
they left us â™ª

â™ª And our
daddies took a ride... â™ª

Come on.

Shit!

â™ª And we held
our head up high â™ª

â™ª Well we once were
the jesters â™ª

â™ª In your kingdom by the sea â™ª

â™ª And now we're out to be
the masters â™ª

Over here!
Come on!

Come on, play with us.
I love you, Phillip!

â™ª We want to feel ya â™ª

â™ª We don't
mean to kill ya â™ª

â™ª We come back to
heal ya â™ª

â™ª Jangling soul â™ª

â™ª Edward and the â™ª

â™ª Magnetic Zeros â™ª

( coughing )

â™ª Well your laws
are for dummies yes â™ª

â™ª Your institution's dead â™ª

â™ª I say we're out to
blow the trumpet â™ª

â™ª To wake you
all from bed â™ª

â™ª From bed â™ª

â™ª We want to feel ya â™ª

â™ª We don't
mean to kill ya â™ª

â™ª We come back to
heal ya â™ª

â™ª Jangling soul â™ª

man: My guest tonight,

Jamie Johnson, on a very special
edition of "Sunbeat Now."

First of all,
this is really big news

you're breaking here on
"Sunbeat."

You're pregnant with
the messiah's child.

How exciting for you.

I'm just happy to bring
attention to the plight

of the single expectant
mother/celebrity/author.

Now, you dated Phillip
before he was famous.

He wasn't even
Phil the Messiah then.

The question everyone
wants to know,

and forgive me for asking,

how is Phil the Messiah
in bed?

Puta.

( giggling )
Come on.

Is he a giver or a taker?

Does he try to
satisfy you

or does he just
take care of himself?

All those intimate details
are in my book,

"Immaculate Deception."

No, you don't.

( laughing )

So the messiah in bed...

That's the deception.

Glenn, unfortunately,

even God doesn't know
how to please a woman.

Mrs. Katz.
Mrs. Katz.

Mrs. Katz, you look great.

Don't worry.

He's gonna love you.

( birds chirping )

( whistling )

( clearing throat )

I was told you
wished to speak with me.

Yes.

Hello, I'm Mrs. Katz.

Ahh.

How may I be
of assistance?

I'm here to see Phillip.

He's my son.

I'm not at liberty to grant
access to his person.

Okay, what room is he in?

Madam, I cannot allow the
release of that information.

I want to see my son!

( birds crowing )

( cell phone ringing )

If you'll excuse me.

Hello?

It's me, Josephine.

I need to see Phillip now.

If you'll have a drink
in the vestibule,

you never know
what the cat may drag in.

( phone ringing )

Hello?
It's me, Josephine.

I'm outside.
Outside where?

Outside your door.

Shit.
Shit?

Shit what?

What shit, what?

I can't let you in right now.
Why not?

Do you have
a girl in there?

Phillip, are you
aware of what's on TV?

If you have an opportunity,
grab it by the balls!

I'll meet you
down by the pool.

Did you do it,
did you fuck her?

I slept with her once,
briefly.

Don't tell me,
I don't want to know.

I have to do the right thing.
The right thing?

I hope you mean
an abortion.

You're pro-choice, right?

Well, yes,
but not officially.

People think you're becoming
decadent.

We don't want to
give them ammunition.

If this is my responsibility,
I need to get in touch with her.

Well, we need to do
an interview.

Something positive,
something upbeat.

People are freaking out
about this sun thing

and we need to
give them something

simple and straightforward.

If you don't
give them a message soon,

you run the very real risk

that they are
going to turn on you.

Don't you understand?

I want to
give them a message.

I want to have a message.

I want to save
the sun from dying.

I don't know how.

I don't know what to do.

If you don't come up with
something to sell them,

they're gonna think
that you took advantage

of this whole sun thing
for your own benefit.

Took advantage?

I never said
that I was any of this.

You're the one that made me
into all of this--

You took advantage of your
position in life.

That was your choice.

I didn't mean to,
I just sort of fell into it.

Listen.

The message doesn't matter.

It's how you
make people feel

about the message
that counts.

Mrs. Katz: Phillip!

They wouldn't let me
through to your room!

I-- I need to talk to you

about these
men from Hollywood!

( screaming )

Hold on, Mom, I'm coming.

No, you can't go out there,
there's a lot of photographers.

I have to help my mom.
Hey, Keith!

You can't afford any more
bad press right now.

She's my mom, I have to--

Hey, hey!

Get off me.
I'm drowning!

Don't you know who I am?

Do you watch the news?
Throw her a noodle.

I'm the second coming of--

You are both
going straight to hell!

I want your first
and last names,

you are both
going straight to hell!

Get the fuck off me!

Glenn on TV: Boffo for
Jamie Johnson's booty,

reported to be good for
not six, not seven

but eight digits.

Pat on the back
for something she claims

to have written in less
than three weeks.

Thomas, I need your advice.

Thomas.

Do you think that I'm...

Lord of all things?

Not quite sure that
I'm qualified to make

that sort of decision, sir.

I bled from my eyes
in a church.

Well, I pissed blood once
after eating bad shellfish

off the coast of Argentina.

Didn't seem to grant me
any magical powers.

So you don't think I am?

I'm an employee, sir.

I have no opinion.

As the son of God,
I command you

to tell me what you think.

I thought it was
the son of the son--

Oh, all right, fine.

As the son
of the son of God,

I command you to tell me
what you think.

Excuse me, sir,
but the point is,

this is a very difficult time

for people living
on the Earth.

There's all this business
of the sun going on right now.

The sun up there, not you.

Uh, may I?

( "Hava Nagila" playing )

Uh, I'm so sorry.

They're preparing
a bar mitzvah next door.

I'll ask them to turn it down,
shall I--

( music stops )

Oh, divine intervention.

Phillip, there's really no need
for you to be so worried.

What's happening
to you is nothing new.

You're not the first.

I have concierged
for rock stars,

for film icons,
for football players.

When they can no longer
distract the public

by throwing a football
or lip-synching a song,

they move on...

and look for someone else
to distract them.

Right now...

it's your turn.

The world is looking to you
for its distraction.

But what if
I'm not divinely chosen?

Chosen, not chosen.

Does it really matter?

Lead or be led.

Serve or be
served.

I chose to serve.

Ended up being towels
and cheese, mostly.

I need to do something
important,

something that
will change things.

Why not make a speech?

A speech!

I need to get to work.

Well, don't forget your
visage de guerre, sir.

Thank you, Thomas.

Thank you for
everything.

Thank you, sir.

Ooh, can I have
the ch-- Yeah.

Thank you.

( "Hava Nagila" playing )

man on TV: Back to our exclusive
special on Jamie Johnson,

mother of the child
of the son of God.

Hello in there?

What do you want?

She mentions that she never had
a long-term relationship...

Leave me alone!

For Christ's sake, can't you
all just leave me alone?

I'm not here for
your son, Mrs. Katz.

I'm here to help you.

If you have
something to say,

say it before somebody
else does.

man: Truly amazing.

And who should
I make it out to?

Son of Morning.

Is that with an "O"
or with a "U"?

Whatever you feel is right.

First I want to thank you
for taking the time

to connect with me.

When I listen to you speak,
I feel a sense of loss

and because I have
a need to feel hopeful,

I'm requesting that
you hear my need

and refrain from
spreading your message.

My message?

Yeah, your example.

You are profiteering off
of a gift.

Your time's up.

You'll need to buy
another book.

No, no.

Your campaign of vulgar
opportunism is distracting us

from the hope that Phillip
brings to all of us.

You can't talk to me
like that.

I'm famous.

This-- this is not
your salvation.

This is your destruction!

Get the fuck out of here
or I'm calling the cops.

I-- I hear your
requests to feel safe.

My need for you to hear
my pain was not meant.

Time's up.
No, no, no, wait.

It's impossible
for us to talk

and listen at the same time.

Do something with your life,
you sad piece of shit!

I apologize on behalf of
your childhood caregivers.

You are loved,
you are needed.

Security!
No, no, no!

Security!

Just...

We are not immune to
a disease

of our own creation!

Security!

Give me that,
give me that!

Security!

( screaming )

( thundering )

( bell ringing )

Sir, there are some
gentlemen waiting.

They're from the state
attorney general's office.

They wish to speak
with you.

Do they have
an appointment?

No.

Thomas, I really
can't see anybody

until I'm done writing
my speech.

Hmm.

man on TV: Here at CCA, we
have Jennifer with the story.

Jennifer?

Jennifer: Peters'
immediate claim

after the slaying of
Jamie Johnson

was that Phillip had
ordered him to kill her

and her unborn child

in order to attract attention
to Peters' own

nonprofit conflict-
resolution charity.

Public reaction has
soured overnight

for the fledgling savior.

Shall I let
the gentlemen in?

What?
I'd rather not get involved.

You don't have to
get involved.

Just-- just-- just tell
them I'm in the bath.

Mustn't forget.

The owner of the hotel
has rung up.

He's asked me to
leave this with you.

What is that?

Oh, shit!

Right, well, I'll just let
the gentlemen in, shall I?

And then, unfortunately,
I'll have to be off.

I'm serving
champagne cocktails

in the Manatee Lounge.

Sir...

good luck.

â™ª Suppertime in the hole... â™ª

( pounding on door )
Mr. Katz!

woman on TV: Investigators
believe that Phillip Katz

may have been compensating
Peters for the future murder

of Jamie Johnson
and her unborn fetus.

( pounding on door )

â™ª Suppertime â™ª

â™ª Old Saint John
on death row â™ª

â™ª He's just
waiting for a pardon â™ª

â™ª Old Saint John
on death row â™ª

â™ª He's just

â™ª Jury on trial

â™ª Jury on trial
I testify â™ª

â™ª I got to keep on runnin'
'til the well runs dry... â™ªâ™ª

Mr. Katz.

You have a martyr complex?

No.

Yet you claim
to be the messiah.

You say so, not me.

I can assure you,
I didn't say so, Mr. Katz.

( thundering )

They.

Sir, who are "they"?

More talking gerbil!

Come on!

Who are "they"?

More talking gerbil!

Sir?

( thundering )

Who are "they"?

Everybody-- the television,
the Internet.

Everybody.

Sir, the deposition panel
was formed--

Yeah, we're not here
to discover

what everybody else thinks.

We're here to find out what
Mr. Katz believes.

I spoke to the lieutenant
governor, a personal friend,

and he is less than thrilled
with this massive cornhole

you have dumped on his doorstep.

He has given this
panel judicial authority

and we can hold you
in contempt, boy!

Sir, do you claim to be
someone called--

Are you the Son of Morning?

And, if so, is it "sun" with
a "U" or "son" with an "O"?

And is it "morning,"

Iike in the "sun" with a "U"
or is it "mourning,"

Iike in a bereavement?

Mr. Katz, are you
the Son of Morning?

He's not cooperating.

Were you in any type of
correspondence

with a gentleman by
the name of Gabriel Peters?

No response.

Did you ever instruct

Gabriel Peters
in question to murder a woman

by the name of Jamie Johnson,
or anyone else,

in the name of something
called "The Son of Morning"?

( screaming )

More talking gerbil.

Is he on drugs?

No, not that
I'm aware of.

Well...

maybe he should be.

Dr. Villager,
do something about him,

would you, please?

â™ª There's nothing
to do here â™ª

â™ª So just
whine and complain â™ª

â™ª In bed at the hospital â™ª

â™ª Coming and going â™ª

â™ª Asleep and awake â™ª

â™ª In bed at
the hospital â™ª

â™ª Tell me the story of
how you ended up here â™ª

â™ª I've heard it all
in the hospital â™ª

â™ª Nothing's sufficing â™ª

â™ª Doctors on tour â™ª

â™ª Somewhere in India... â™ª

man on TV: I'm the only one?

I'm the only one that knew
this dude was a fraud?

Come on, the messiah?

Really?

He had you?

Well, guess what?

I'm the messiah's black friend,
how about that?

( phone ringing )

Hello?

woman: Mr. Katz, you have
a telephone call

from your mother.

Would you like to
accept the call?

Yes, please.

Hi, Mom?

No, it's Josephine Tuttle.

How are you?

No response.

Did you hear the news?

What news?

Jamie Johnson was a fraud.

She was never pregnant
to begin with.

She used you
to sell her book.

Do you have any reaction
to that?

â™ª Don't stop,
don't stop â™ª

â™ª Put out the fire on us â™ª

â™ª Bring the buckets
by the dozens â™ª

â™ª Bring your nieces
and your cousins... â™ªâ™ª

( knocking )

Hey there, pal.

How you doing?

It seems from the tests
we conducted and examined

that you, my friend,
are suffering from

some highly elevated
levels of cortisol.

What do I have?

Well, in my opinion,

you got one big case
of being stressed out,

clinically.

Not a heck of a lot
more than that.

So what I'd like to do

is I'd like to get you
on these for awhile

and see how that works out.

Depending on your reaction,
we'll go from there.

I'd like to keep
you for observation,

out of the spotlight
for the time being.

Okay.

Oh, and, Phillip,

try to find an outlet
for all this anxiety, huh?

Otherwise, you're never
gonna make it, buddy.

â™ª Run â™ª

â™ª Run â™ª

â™ª Run to your grave â™ª

â™ª Run â™ª

â™ª Run â™ª

â™ª Run to your grave â™ª

â™ª Run â™ª

â™ª Oh run â™ª

â™ª Run to your grave â™ª

â™ª Run â™ª

â™ª Oh run â™ª

â™ª Run to your grave â™ª

â™ª 'Cause they're coming â™ª

â™ª For your brain but â™ª

â™ª They will leave â™ª

â™ª With your head â™ª

â™ª They've got money â™ª

â™ª And science â™ª

â™ª But they will leave
you for dead â™ª

â™ª Sleep â™ª

â™ª Sleep â™ª

â™ª Sleep in your tomb â™ª

â™ª Sleep â™ª

â™ª Oh sleep â™ª

â™ª Sleep in your tomb â™ª

â™ª Don't bury your body â™ª

â™ª With your diamonds â™ª

â™ª 'Cause you know they-- â™ªâ™ª

( sighing )

Mom?

Mom?

Phillip?

I'm so sorry, I--

I wasn't prepared
for visitors, I...

What visitors?

I would've gotten ready.

I would've
made myself up.

Presentation is five-tenths
of the...

the thing.

What are you
talking about?

Phillip, do you know
Katherine Jayne?

Katherine Jayne?

It's the Katherine Jayne
disaster supply kit for women.

This is going to improve
the lives

of men-less women everywhere.

It's so that when
something happens bad,

a woman can remain refreshed
and looking her best.

Feel my skin.

How does that feel?

When did all this happen?

When?

When you were at
your five-star resort,

fantasy hotel

with your fabulous
celebrity friends.

When I was left here alone
to fend for myself.

That's when Joyce came here,

and she said that
I would be the best person

to get these supply kits
to women who need them.

More talking gerbil!

You're not the only one

who can save people,
you know.

I'm going to bed.

I'm tired of being
unappreciated.

I need to resolve myself.

Clinically.

man on TV: In a meeting today
at the global site in Geneva,

a consensus of the world's
leading stellar scientists

have concluded that the
terrestrial sun's

recent increase
in flare activity

is actually the result
of a normal cycle

and does not
represent the final stage

in the death of our sun,
as many have believed.

I have something to say.

Okay.

On television.

You had your chance,
your 1 5 minutes are up.

But I know what
I want to say now.

I have a message.

Please?

I don't know.

You owe me.

I'm doing this bullshit
piece on sea turtles

at Spanish River Beach.

I could try to
pull some strings.

I might be able to get you
a few minutes

between traffic
and sports with Fritz.

Thank you.

This is Josephine Tuttle
reporting to you live

from Spanish River Beach
here in Boca Raton

with Phillip Katz,

who one time,
not very long ago,

was thought by the majority

to be man's
last hope for salvation

from fear of the dying sun.

I have covered
Phillip's story

from the day he chose to
reveal himself

to a small congregation
here in Boca Raton.

There's been some
confusion as to whether Phillip

may have been some kind of
false messiah.

In this live interview,

Phillip Katz will finally
reveal his story to the world.

Now?
Yeah.

What I've learned,
from my experience,

is that when the world
is about to end,

food tastes better,

fabrics feel softer,

the air
smells better,

dreams seem more real

and people...

People are very strange.

We live in
and are educated by a system

that is supposed to protect us,
but it doesn't protect us...

( horns honking )

... distracting us from our
compassionate nature.

But if something
is missing in your life,

you can't look to another
person to fill that void...

( horns honking )

I can't tell you what
the clam chowder tastes like.

You have to taste it
for yourselves.

( exhaling )

Gabe: We have tried before,
we have failed.

But we must try again.

We love to build people up
and then break 'em down.

Maybe it's pointless,
maybe it's justified,

maybe we're just constantly
disappointed in each other.

It's hard to say.

But hey...

I saw the sun
rise this morning.

â™ª Well I lost
my innocence today â™ª

â™ª I could feel her
in my bones â™ª

â™ª My bones
my bones, my bones â™ª

â™ª My blood, my blood
my blood, my blood â™ª

â™ª I woke up tired and scared
and sad â™ª

â™ª Soaked drained
I felt so bad â™ª

â™ª Today, today, today â™ª

â™ª What you still, you still
you still, you still â™ª

â™ª Won't you say
you say, you say, you say â™ª

â™ª What you feel, you feel
you feel, you feel â™ª

â™ª Which is nothing
but hollow feelings yeah â™ª

â™ª I am done
I just don't care â™ª

â™ª And forget happiness â™ª

â™ª I'm fine â™ª

â™ª I'll forget
everything in time â™ª

â™ª I swear I didn't know â™ª

â™ª You know me â™ª

â™ª How I can't let go â™ª

â™ª And we're not gods â™ª

â™ª We're just hacks â™ª

â™ª All that life
amongst the cracks â™ª

â™ª The scars the siege
that breaks â™ª

â™ª The ugliest scenes
the worst mistakes â™ª

â™ª And everywhere
I see her face â™ª

â™ª Such a beautiful child
such an awful waste â™ª

â™ª And there's
no innocence like hers â™ª

â™ª Just emptiness and nerves â™ª

â™ª And this light â™ª

â™ª From the window
of my car â™ª

â™ª She'll never see it â™ª

â™ª Oh my God â™ª

â™ª I was so surprised â™ª

â™ª It blew up
in my face â™ª

â™ª Lord I lost my nerve â™ª

â™ª Oh my God â™ª

â™ª Oh my God â™ª

â™ª Oh my God â™ª

â™ª And I tear â™ª

â™ª I tear â™ª

â™ª So hard â™ª

â™ª And I tear â™ª

â™ª I tear â™ª

â™ª So hard â™ª

â™ª And I beg
and scream â™ª

â™ª I was wrong â™ª

â™ª It's over
she's gone â™ªâ™ª
