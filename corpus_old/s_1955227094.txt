[Car honking]

[Bell ringing]

[Water dripping]


Fuck!

Oh, God.

[Woman screaming]


You got me, Scarlet.

I'm all yours.

Scarlet!

[Music - "what is a victim?"]


What is a victim?

What is revenge?

Was she a victim to them?

Was I too late to stop them?

Soon enough they'll
be the victim.

I will find those motherfuckers.

Eulogy I write in blood.

One bullet wasn't enough
to fuckin' kill me.

Let them be to be.

When they see my tattooed body,
I want them to know my face.

Let them be the victim.

Let them be the victim.

What is a victim?

One by one, becoming victims.

What is a victim?

Seek revenge, my crime of hate.

What is a victim?

I will make them know my weapon.

What is a victim?

I will make them
know their fate.

What is a victim?

We should take him
out to the gutter.

Everybody know what happens
when you fuck with us.

You think Scarlet
would like that?

Dukes was crystal
clear about all this.

Clean as a whistle.

Fuck that.

You know I ain't cleanin' up no
brain tissue shit on a Sunday.

Motherfucker can kiss my ass.

[Music - "what is a victim?"]

BRICKS: (SINGING) Slipping on
the floor and guts and organs,

Crack your fuckin' skull
and laugh at myself.

Duct tape and rope
and all my playthings,

Little vengeance
to relieve my pain.

They'll know the
meaning of victim.

They'll know the meaning of

Pain!

Poindexter, where's my gal?

Fuck you.

Your buddy didn't last five
seconds in the ring with me.

How long you think
you're gonna last?

Now, who sent you?

Think real hard.

You know where she is?

Who?

Oh, fuck.

Fuck.

Sure, Dukes, no problem, clean
up some blood, no problem.

[Phone ringing]

What the fuck?

Don't move, man.

Who sent you?

Something about, maybe, Dukes?

Hear he's still working.

You ever been in love, Dex?

I got a wife, man, and a kid.

Yeah, well then you know
it makes you a better man,

Makes you stop and
smell the rhododendrons.

I need her, and you're
standing in my way!

Nothin' personal.

Fucking guns.

Right answer.

[Phone beep]

What the fuck is this?

Fuckin' pig.

Fuck!

Yeah, you think that's funny?

Huh?

You little fuck.

Fuckin' dead man,
your best friend.

You tell this Dukes asshole
he's number one on my shit list.

Eugene Raymond Hicks.

They know your name.

They're coming for you.

Lucky for me, I'm going by
Bricks these days, Mr. Bricks.

pills, Tuesday the noose,

Wednesday the gun.

Thursday the juice, Friday
the fun, Saturday I'm gone,

Sunday sleep eternally.

Sunday suicide
demons walk with me.

Love is murder.

Murder is love on
a Sunday suicide.

Sunday suicide, maybe love is.

I think love is
suicide, suicide,

Suicide, suicide, suicide,
suicide, suicide, suicide.

Sing, sing off-key.

She used to sing to
me, but now woe is me.

If I kill this man,
I'll surely go to hell,

But I'll drag him down with me.

If I kill myself I'll surely go
to hell, but it'll be just me.

Sunday suicide.

Sunday suicide.

Love is murder.

Murder is love on
a Sunday suicide.

Sunday suicide.

Suicide, suicide,
suicide, suicide, suicide,

Suicide, suicide, suicide.

I'm coming for you, baby!

You OK?

Come in.

I'm gonna need
these for evidence.

They look good.

I look like shit.

You look good to me.

I just wanna go home.

You're safe here.

I'd be safer at home with
my Daddy's Glock in my lap.

Trust me.

No one knows you're here but me.

How long?

Until every 'i' is dotted
and every 't' is crossed.

I want to do this right.

Everything's going
to be all right.

Bullshit.

Tell me what happened.

I mean one minute you're there,
the next minute you're not.

The mic got zip.

How'd he get past me?

PROSTITUTE: Stay the fuck
off of me, ugly bitch.

PROSTITUTE 2: (SARCASTICALLY)
Why don't you suck my dick?

Look at that
turkey, turkey clit.


PROSTITUTE: Your pussy smell
like rotten flounder, bitch.

PROSTITUTE 2: That's a dick.


I guess the batteries died.

Quite the fucking coincidence.

Don't push me.

Do you know the shit
that I have been through?

Trying to find you,
going on my own,

Pissing off the higher-ups.

I couldn't sleep.

I kept hearing these
thoughts of finding

You dead in the fucking gutter.

I need to know.

Did he...

Did he what?

Jesus, Moretti,
did he touch you?

He is dead.

You did your job, you
protected your partner.

It's over.

Then how do you explain these?

Go home to your stupid
fucking wife and back off.

Fuck this.

[Woman screaming]

I'm no one's victim, victim.

Bloody, broken, beat-up,
that's all he sees.

Purple bruises, they
blossom on my wrists,

A reminder I can still
feel you inside me.

Stockholm syndrome.

You left your bloody kiss.

Torn up, so torn by you.

No one ever hurt me.

You ripped me in two.

Torn, I'm so torn by you.

No one ever hurt me.

You fucked me good.

What is love?

I know that I should feel sick.

What is love?

I don't feel so sick.

Split in two, two different
minds, ripped open wide,

I'm feeling torn.

I'm so torn by you.

No one ever hurt me.

You ripped me in two.

Torn, I'm so torn by you.

Taste that shit.

Mother fuck you.

Die like you should.

Victim, victim, I'm
not a victim, victim.

Just a little scarred,
scarred, and I will heal.

Here, you get well

Hey, hey, hey!

Nancy boy, Nancy boy.

You know, the polite thing
to do is to say you're sorry.

I own one of these
buildings over... woah, uh...

Don't fuck with me.

Uh, uh we better go.

Who is it?

[Doorbell ringing]

Brother, how are you?

Let me in, asshole.

You don't look too good, man.

Jesus Christ, what
happened to you?

Fucking nasty.

Don't worry.

It's not as bad as it looks.

Where's Jenny?

What do you want with Jenny?

I need a nurse.

She works at a vet's office,
man that ain't the same thing.

Mother... Yo, Jenny.

Bricksy!

Jenny!

Beat it!

What the hell happened?

Don't go fuckin'
around with that,

You're just gonna make it worse.

Does it hurt?

Yeah, baby, it kills.

I guess the rumors I
heard about you were true.

What have you heard?

I heard you were in
trouble, the cops.

Yeah, just stitch me up
and I'll be on my way.

I gotta go into work
and get some stuff.

Fuck that.

Needle and thread, stitch me up.

OK, just keep
applying pressure.

You're freaking her out, man.

She ain't used to
seeing shit like this.

Cops been around here?

No, man.

No way.

This is all I got.

Mmm, fuck yeah.

It's gonna hurt.

Bring it on, baby.

Got a girl.

Hot shit.

What's her name?

Scarlet.

She's pretty.

Yeah.

She better have a
golden fucking pussy.

You ever been in love, Jas?

Sure, lots of times.

I see her, right?

In my brain.

It goes on repeat.

Gotta have her.

Gotta have her.

This is gonna sting.

Fuck!

Wake up this morning
with a bullet

Hole in my fuckin' skull, and
all I got to remember my girl,

And a few memories
floating in and out.

But I got a lead on the
dead man who took her,

Pig by the name of Dukes.

I want what's mine.

The only place you're headed
is the morgue, my friend.

Fucking with the pigs?

Nah, I'm thinking more Puerto
Rico, my girl a little bikini,

Mmm yeah.

Don't move.

Fuck this.

Everything's gonna be fine.

[Woman wimpering]

If you touch me, I'll
cut off your fucking balls

And feed them to you.

I swear to God.

said, forgive and forget,

But revenge is the only way.

I'll do anything to get
this demon out of my chest.

Forgive.

Forget.

Forgive.

I can't forgive nothing, forgive
nothing, forgive nothing.

I can't forgive,
forgive, forgive.

I won't.

Maybe with your face off,
starting nice and clean,

Already ripped my soul out,
came out nice and clean.

Evil nights have found me,
never wanna be like this.

Evil nights have found me,
never wanna be like this,

Never wanna be like this.

Forgive nothing, forgive
nothing, forgive nothing.

I can't forgive,
forgive, forgive.

I can't forgive.

Gotta love the demon now.

They cannot live.

Gotta love the demon

No god forgives.

[Phone ringing]

Mr. Kent, have you heard
from a certain friend of ours

Recently?

It depends.

Spill it and that drug
charge is kaput, my man.

Do you wanna go back on
a bullshit drug charge?

Prison wasn't kind to you
the first time, am I right?

He's hurt.

He's weak, but he's alive.

Don't underestimate
this rapist motherfucker.

Think of your sister.

You want her in danger?

You gonna get the case dropped?

You can do that?

You're not just
sh... shittin' me?

You help me out and the judge
won't even hear your name.

He's here, at my
sister's in Queens.

You're done, Bricksy.

Shit!

You're out through
the worst of it.

I always do the stitches
after the neuters.

Pretty good if I say so myself.

Yeah, aces.

Got any happy pills?

Let me see what Jasper's got.

Fuck.

Yeah.

JENNY: Bricksy, come here!

You drunk asshole.

You want?

Yes.

Enough.

Let me see what he's got.

Yeah.

Pick one.

That's it?

How come you don't come
around anymore, huh?

You didn't even
come for Christmas.

No.

Beat it, Jenny.

When you asked Jas if he's
ever been in love before?

Well, I have and it's torture.

SCARLET (VOICEOVER):

No, look.

I am not going to fuck
you, Jenny, but thanks.

Come on, Bricksy.

Come on, baby.

SCARLET: (WHISPERING)
Oh, Bricksy.

[Phone vibrating]

Pick up the phone, you asshole.

Now, hit me!

What?

Fight me.

Who the fuck?

Open up!

Motherfucker!

He's in here!

You fuck!

JENNY: Get off of him!

Fuck!

JASPER: What the fuck is that?

What the fuck is this?

JENNY: What did you do?

Jasper!
JENNY: No!

JASPER: I can't go back in, man!
JENNY: No!

PROSTITUTE 2: We got

SCARLET: You stalking me?

You like that?

Out in the street with
your ass hanging out?

We fucked a few times.

Doesn't give you the
right to follow me around

Like a fucking dog, does it?

You want me to be your dog?

You want me on my knees?

'Cuz I'll do it.

I put a background on you.

Yeah?

You were in prison
for 10 years.

So what?

Fuck off.

I don't do criminals.

Mess with me.

I'll have your ass
back in prison so fast.

Yeah?

I knew your daddy.

What?

He got the picture
of you in his wallet.

You were 15.

Recognized you the second
you walked into that bar.

How did you know my father?

I saw him around.

I helped him out.

He helped me out.

What could you have possibly
done to help him out?

You want the truth?

Whatever you're
implying about my father,

He was a good cop, the best.

Yeah?

What about you, huh?

You a good cop?

Absolutely.

Even though they got you
out here on pussy patrol?

Forget you knew me.

Forget you knew my father.

I can't.

They way your daddy
talked about you,

You're like an angel
come from Heaven.

And now you're mine.

Get off me.

Leave!

I don't want you.

Listen to me!

Where the fuck have you been?

You hungry?

Am I free to go, officer?

What's the news?

Well, there's been
a complication.

Like what?

He's alive.

alive, where is he now?

Alive, alive, bad
feelings tonight.

I can't think.

I can't feel.

I can't move I can't see.

I can't think.

I can't feel.

I can't move.

I can't be free.

Bad omen tonight.

My scarred I stare
out in the night.

Forgive me, my partner.

Forgive for what I must do.

Forgive me my partner.

I must leave you.

Forgive me my partner.

Forgive.

I know it's in you.

I know I swore an oath.

I know I'm breaking the code.

Hey!

Let go of me!

Calm the fuck down

You are nothing to
me, don't touch me.

Let me take care of this.

I don't need you.

You fucked up.

He's still out there.

I'm not gonna let you leave.

So eat.

He's bleeding.

He's on the move.

So I'm gonna go call them in.

When they do, I'll be there.

And I'll stick a gun
right up his ass.

When this is all over,
I want a new partner.

No fucking way.

You got a problem with me?

Tell me right now.

I want a new partner, asshole.

Well, I want a... I want
to a fucking reason.

Your wife hates me.

There's a reason.

That's bullshit, bullshit.

Amy kicked me out.

So what?

She'll take you back.

She always does.

For good this time, she says.

Bitch.

Fuck her.

Found something of yours.

What about my fucking gun?

Found that?

Sorry.

So I can, uh, stay
here tonight, right?


[Phone ringing]

Officer Dukes.

It's me, baby.

BRICKS: (ON PHONE) Is he
there with you right now?

This Dukes motherfucker?

What do you want?

You.

To see you again.

Forget it.

It's not gonna happen.

You ever been in love, Scarlet?

and I ain't fuckin' dead yet.

What do you think that is?

Look...

Love, baby, love.

You hurt me.

That's not love.

Bullshit!

Take my guts, take my
heart, take my soul.

It's yours!

SCARLET: I don't want it.

You ever killed a man, huh?

See the life leave his body?

Once.

How'd it feel?

Like it did the world a favor.

It's a waste of
life, just like you.

You want me dead?

Come get me.

You're already a
dead man walking.

You think you're
gonna last the night?

I'm gonna keep coming for you.

I'm never gonna stop.

I'll keep killing everyone
that gets in my way.

You want to be
responsible for that?

The warehouse.

Meet me in two hours.

No pigs.

Just me, alone.

Sounds like a big risk.

You gonna turn me down?

I got a date with destiny.

You gonna wear
something pretty for me?

SCARLET: No!

No!

[Scarlet crying]

BRICKS: Tell me you love me.

Tell me you love me.

[Sounds from TV]

SCARLET: I'm freezing
my nuts off out here.

[Dukes laughing]

[Phone ringing]

Amy.

I'm at work.

I'm working, working.

AMY (ON PHONE):
Oh, I got the kids.

I made fucking baked ziti.

I don't know I'm
going to be home.

No, I have no fucking clue.

Amy, I'm at work.

AMY (ON PHONE): Your
mother, you know,

She's gonna be all
up in my business,

Why do I have to
do all the work?

I don't know when
I'm going to be home.

It's not a nine-to-five.

I can't tell you I'm gonna
be home at a certain time.

I'm just telling
you, I... [inaudible].

AMY (ON PHONE): I don't
fucking appreciate this.

No, no, no, no, no.

AMY (ON PHONE): Are you
all with that bitch?

I don't fuck with
this shit, like...

I love you, I just...

AMY (ON PHONE): Don't lie to me.
You know I don't...

Fuck!

Police!
Police!

Purple dress, where'd she go?

Purple dress, where'd she go?

I don't believe you.
Pink?

No!

Purple dress!

Where'd she go?

Over there.

Get the fuck out of my way.


[TV sounds]

[Music - "betray"]


All my fault, betrayed!

Why'd you leave?

Betray.

Anger, rage, betray.

Why'd you go?

I blame myself for this crime.

Betray.

Tell me why.

Betray.

Therefore you betray.

Run away.

Betray.

Wanna cross the line.

Gonna cross the
line, lose my mind.

Gonna cross the line.

Breakdown.

Break my code, break my oath,
lost my honor to ra... Betray,

Betray the badge, the badge.

Where's your loyalty?

Betray, betray, the
badge, the badge.

Fuck the thin blue line.

If I find out that
you fucked him.

If I find out I will lose it.

If I find out he will feel
police, police brutality.

[Phone ringing]

What am I doing here?

DUKES: Sit down.

You a good cop?

SCARLET: Absolutely.

It's hard sometimes
to be a good and a cop

Because, sometimes, you
gotta do bad things.

I need your help.

Where is he?

Your brother helped me.

He did the right thing.

Yeah, and he paid
for it, didn't he?

Where is he?

I don't know.

Tell me you little cunt.

He's a dangerous man, Miss Kent.

He doesn't care
about anybody or you.

He doesn't care about you!

Fuck you!

What about him?

You want him alive?

Either he dies in the
streets like a dog,

Or he comes in peacefully.

He'll never give himself up.

He'll die first.

Then that's how it will happen.

You sealed his fate, Jenny.

Scarlet.

What?

Scarlet what's-her-face?

She's that missing cop
in the news, right?

Moretti.

He said something about
being in love with her,

Going down to the islands.

That's... that's all I know.

He murdered your brother.

I met him a few times at
a dive on 36th, Wonderbar.

He knows some guys there.

Now get the fuck out.

Thank you.

JENNY: Please!

Please, please!

Bricksy.

[Music - "brick by brick"]

brick, I threw myself up.

Brick by brick, I
tore myself down.

Brick by brick,
won't do it again.

Two by two, four by
four, six by six...

[Bar chatter]

Staple gun!

It's over there, Bricks.

Christ.

I cannot have him
coming in here, man.

You see?

There's something
wrong with him.

He's gonna come
here, bring the cops.

When was the last
time you ID'd, Mike?

Do you ever ID anybody?

You fuck up, we get shut down,
and you go back to jail, Mike.

I hear you.

Handle it.

And you, MJ, are you
ever gonna come in here

And pay the fucking tab?

You have any money?

I thought... I thought you did.

[Music - "brick by brick"]

BAND: (SINGING) Brick by
brick, I threw myself up.

Brick by brick, I
tore myself down.

Brick by brick, I
threw myself up.

Brick by brick, I
won't do it again.

Won't turn away like
I did last time.

Brick by brick, brick by
brick, brick by brick.

Two by two, four by four,
six by six, eight by eight.

Brick by brick, I put myself up.

Brick by brick, I
tore myself down.

Brick by brick,
won't do it again.

Brick by brick, won't
let myself down.

Won't let myself fall
away like I did last time.

[Bricks screaming]

Fuck!

the air I breathe,

Victim inside me, accident
casualty of his greed,

Of his greed.

Your daddy's a killer.

Your mommy's a killer.

Hand in hand beneath the skull
'til you bleed, 'til you bleed.

Heartbeat.

My life is a crime scene,
nothing but body bags.

Nothing but open wounds.

Two twisted hearts
bleed inside me.

My life is crime scene, inside
my guts, inside my blood.

Bullet hole inside my heart.

One twisted heart will
bleed to death tonight.

Heartbeats,
heartbeats, heartbeats.

Start the fire.

We burn the fear.

Fear the fire and
burn the bridge.

Shed my skin, let me
burn just a little bit.

Shed my skin, let me
burn, let me burn.

Heartbeats.

My life is a crime
scene, nothing but body

Bags, nothing but open wounds.

Two twisted hearts
beat inside me.

My life is a crime scene,
inside my thoughts,

Inside my blood, a bullet
hole inside my heart.

One twisted heart will
bleed to death tonight.

Heartbeats.

MAN (VOICEOVER): (SINGING) All
of the pain has come at once.

All that I used to
be has changed in me.

DUKES: Hey, shithead!

Lose the hood.

Lose it!

So you're the
coward with the gun.

We can do this the easy
way or the hard way.

Fuck you!


[Bricks growling]

I live by a code.

BRICKS: Kill or
be killed, right?

What did you do to her?

Did you touch her?

Did you rape her?

Fuck.

You ever been in love?

Fucking psycho.

She left me, my
wife, kicked me out.

She tore my heart in
two and pissed on it.

You should fight for her.

Without her, you're
breathing stale air.

Your dick should be
getting hard every time

You think about how she smells.

You should be so
hungry that nothing can

Fill the holes in your guts.

She's not the one
I'm fighting for.

[Church bells]

VOICE: (SINGING) When
you're left with me

Every moment, every day,
through the good times

And the bad, my only love.

SCARLET (VOICEOVER): Bricksy.


As the sun sets, my
soul grows cold again.

Back to where it all began.

It's like a death in the
family, I'm home again.

Write a eulogy, give it all
I've got, walk through the blood

And take that shot.

Write a eulogy, spare the
daughter and bleed the son.

BRICKS: Yo.

Who's there?

I think I'm hurt, baby.

Looks like it.

Yeah.

Oh, baby.

Oh, baby.

Oh, baby, oh.

Ha, one tough chick.

Don't you forget it.

This is a gift from my father.

He wanted me to be able
to take care of myself.

Mano y mano, is
that what you want?

SCARLET: (SINGING)
What you have to see...

BRICKS: (SINGING)
Such a pretty face...

SCARLET: (SINGING)
Such an animal...

BRICKS: (SINGING)
You know I love you.

SCARLET: (SINGING)
If you had control

BRICKS: (SINGING)
There's no control.

SCARLET: (SINGING) You
could save yourself

ALL: (SINGING) Now.

Only one will leave alive
tonight, bathed in blood.

BRICKS: (SINGING) Wanna be hard?

Wanna be tough?

Willing to fight when you
know you've had enough?

SCARLET: (SINGING)
Do you know how

Long it takes to earn
respect and prove

You're not a weak bitch?

BRICKS: (SINGING)
Respect is blood.

SCARLET: (SINGING)
Respect is love.

ALL: (SINGING) Respect
is love and domination.

All it took was two
hits and I was fucked.

You fucked me.

I coulda broke
your jaw you know,

But I didn't want to ruin
such a beautiful face.

SCARLET: (SINGING) This
is the last goodbye.

I fought too hard to
watch my dreams die.

BRICKS: (SINGING) No
bloody, white picket

Fences, no second chances.

This is the last goodbye.

ALL: (SINGING) Blood in,
blood out, perverted fantasy,

Ecstasy.

This is the last goodbye.

Goodbye.

SCARLET: (SINGING) I'm not so
sorry that it ends like this.

BRICKS: (SINGING) I'm not
so sorry for what I did.

SCARLET: (SINGING) Words
are useless, only the gun.

BRICKS: (SINGING) Our
sins bathed in blood.

Son of a bitch.

Yes.

Your heart beats for me
only because I let it.

Now, tell me you love me.

I hate you.

Say it!

No!

Tell me you love me.

No!

Tell me.

Say it!

I love you.

Only you, baby.

Only you.

Do it.

Do it.

That's my girl.
