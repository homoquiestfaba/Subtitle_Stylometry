Brick Bardo: It's
a cruel world.

It's kind of lonely when
you're only a foot tall

like this little Ginger
who got shrunk by aliens.

Maybe a visit from
Dollman will cheer her up.

I know meeting a chick my
size would make me feel better

about being stuck
on this planet.



Play time.




A Bum: Uh-oh.

Look at this place.



A Bum: Make all the
fucking noise you want.

Don't mean nothing.

I'm here and I'm
warm and I'm dry.

Well, not too dry.

But this is my port
in the storm.

Good evening, everyone.

Hope you don't mind sharing
your home with me for the night

and if you do, fuck you.


Judith Grey: Sir,
I'm here at Toyland.

Now whoever it was I heard
before has dropped into one

of the main storage bins.

Over.

Over is right, Grey.

I told you that house
is off limits.

What the hell are
you doing there?

Judith Grey: My job.

Bullshit.

You're on suspension; remember?

Judith Grey: Sir, like I
told you before, I have known

for months that there's
something going down here.

I don't want to
here this shit, Grey.

Judith Grey: Sir, I'm going

to give you my stakeout
position.

Yeah. Standing
in front of my desk.

I'm sending a unit to pull
your ass out of there.

You're done, Officer.

Judith Grey: Not yet.



A Bum: There's more
fun than [inaudible]

[Laughing/Horn]


Thanks for helping
us out, asshole.

rid of this creep.


Judith Grey: Jesus Christ.

Not quite, slut.


You're full of this shit.

It takes magic to
fight magic, bitch.

Judith Grey: [Inaudible]

Miss me, miss me.

Now you got to kiss me.


Drop the gun.

Now.

Judith Grey: You
guys don't understand.

Do it.

Judith Grey: Look, I'm a cop.

You were a cop, Ms. Grey.

Turn around.

Judith Grey: What?

Up against the wall.

Move it.

Judith Grey: You don't
know what you're doing.

I was firing on a suspect that
escaped through that air duct.

Uh-huh.

You're under arrest.

Judith Grey: What's
the charge?

Discharging a firearm

in the city limits
will do for starters.

This is for your
own good, Ms. Grey.

We don't want anybody
to get hurt.

Judith Grey: Okay.

I've been staking out this
place for months waiting

for these suspects
to make a move.

And now they finally do
and you guys come along

and fuck everything up.

You have the right
to remain silent.

Judith Grey: No,
it's the goddamn toys.

Go after the toys.

Anything you say can
and will be used you.

Judith Grey: You're
letting the toys win.

Let go! No!

Yeah, right.

Well, thanks for coming
along when you guys did

but I probably would
have been able

to handle the weirdo
by myself, of course.

You never know when
you've got to put it all

on the line in this job.

You know what I mean?


Who would have thought
a good looking broad

like that going psycho.

Psycho.

All bitches are crazy, squirt.

Don't look so surprised,
jerk weed.

I know all about women.

Nice [inaudible], half pint.

You've got shit for brains.

I can use someone like you.


Hey, hey.

Rise and shine all you, rodents.

It's a great day to play
hooky and hit the beach.

So come on.

Let's blast out under the
blue skies and crank it.

Ginger: I'd love
to rock out, pal.

Do you know anyone that
will come and get me

down off this kitchen counter?

Brick Bardo: Perfect.

Sheik in a bottle.

All I got to do is find her.

Hey, buddy, you seen a girl
around here about my size?

Huh?

Brick Bardo: What's
the matter?

You never seen a cop before?


This is perfect, baby.

Just the thing to
drive GI Joe insane.

Will you get the
hell out of here?

Look, you're a
public figure now.

Okay. Let's face it.

There aren't that many foot
tall cutie pies running

around out there and the
public has a right to know.

Don't you have any
respect for freedom

of the press for God's sake?

Knock it off.

You're scaring me.

Oh, I think I wet myself.

You could have at least
used a bottle opener.

What do you want?

Collins: An exclusive
interview

with you wearing a teeny
wienie little bikini.

Then you'll leave
me alone forever?

All right.

Collins: Great.

Great. Just give me
a couple of days.

I'll put some wardrobe together.

I'll call Barbie's people.

Maybe they'll give us a loan.

I'll see you later, doll.

I can hardly wait.

[Scary music]



Brick Bardo: The
exterminator is here.

Don't worry.

You're not dreaming.

Ginger: Who are you?

Brick Bardo: Bardo.

Brick Bardo.

The neighbors call me Dollman.

Ginger: Dollman?

Brick Bardo: Not really.


Ginger: I don't
understand any of this.

Did you get shrunk like I did?

Brick Bardo: Come on.

I'll fill you in.

Ginger: Gross.

A month ago I would
have just questioned.

I never know anything so
small could be so scary.

Brick Bardo: Yeah.

Nightmares come in all sizes.

Judith Grey: I
saw your interview.

You know where they are?

Collins: You're
wasting your breath.

Judith Grey: You know,

I can make life very
difficult for you, Collins.

Collins: Yeah.

Look, cop or no cop.

I don't have to give
up a damn thing to you.

Judith Grey: All
I need is an address.

Collins: Ever since
we ran this story,

I've had people dropping out
of trees making me huge offers

to tell them where these
two little freaks are; okay?

Judith Grey: Fine.

So what does it hurt you
to help me a little bit?

Collins: I made a
promise to be discreet.

Judith Grey: What?

Your big offers weren't
big enough.

Collins: Let's just say my
integrity means a lot to me.

Look, you and I don't
have to negotiate

on a cash basis, do we?

Judith Grey: Give me a break.

Collins: You've
got assets, baby.

You should learn
how to use them.

Well...

Judith Grey: Maybe
you're right.

Collins: I always
figured that the cops

and the press should learn how
to cooperate with each other.

But I can't give up anything
until you give something to me.

Judith Grey: Fair enough.

But I've got to have
something, just a taste.

Just so I know that your
information is good, you know?

Collins: It's the best.

this tough.

Okay. Okay.

It's a little nothing
town called Pahoota.

Judith Grey: Pahoota?

Collins: Pahoota.

Judith Grey: Pahoota?

Collins: Yeah.

I can drive us there.

We can spend the
night on the road.

Judith Grey: Sure.

How about when hell
freezes over.

Collins: What?

What is this?

Judith Grey: Thank
you for your cooperation

with my little investigation
of media ethics.

Collins: I'm doing
a story on you.

When I'm done with you,
you're not going to be able

to get a gig as a
crossing guard,

you little prick teasing slut.

Okay. I didn't mean to call
you a prick tease; okay.

[Scuffling noises]

Brick Bardo: You
well done yet?

Ginger: Can't be
too thin or too tan.

Brick Bardo: Or too small.

Ginger: Very funny.

Brick Bardo: Well, these
fire stones that Onteros used

to get them to 400 degrees.

People get so tan
they were toast.

Ginger: Would I
be a babe on Onteros?

Brick Bardo: Yeah.

You'd do all right.

Ginger: Wow.

That almost sounded
like a compliment.

Brick Bardo: Maybe it was.

Ginger: You don't talk too
much about your home, Bardo.

Brick Bardo: Yeah.

I'm too far away from it.

Ginger: Miss it?

Brick Bardo: Not anymore.

Ginger: Then you should
be able to talk about it.

I told you how I got
into this whole mess

and I don't even know how
you ended up on earth.

What's Onteros like?

Are there bug-eyed
monsters all over the place?

Is it real dangerous?

Brick Bardo: Hell.

Your kitchen is dangerous.

Ginger: Come on.

So you're a cop; right?

Brick Bardo: Yeah.

I was a cop.

My beat was Angel City,

a high tech armpit
of a city on Onteros.

My job was to nail every
intergalactic scumbag I could

get my hands on.

I was damn good at it.

That pissed some people off.

Disappointed you didn't get
to kill anyone tonight, Bardo?

You're through.

You goddamn psycho.

Brick Bardo: Hell.

I didn't give a shit about
anything except doing my job.

Screw was a wart on the
asshole of the universe.

We've spent the better part

of the last five eons
trying to kill each other.

You're a very
violent man, Bardo.

Brick Bardo: Yes, I know.

It's a violent universe.

I bet you'd thought you'd
seen the last of me.

Brick Bardo: I am seeing
the last of you, Screw.

After our last encounter this
is all they managed to salvage.

I'll see if I can
remember the first time.

Conglan bank job.

I blew off your left arm.

Most of my left foot.

And then there was
the space extortion.

What did I take?

Two or three legs.

Among other things.

And the last time all I
remember was your head rolling

around in the parking lot.

I didn't think it
was enough to save.

Modern medicine.

They're doing some
wonderful things.

It's too bad your lovely
family couldn't benefit

as I have.

But then I think even our best
doctors couldn't have done

anything with what
was left with them.

Brick Bardo: What
do you want?

You've always
screwed up my plans.

But this time you won't have
a chance because you're going

to be in tiny, tiny
little pieces.

I've heard about this
custom made monster they use.

Don't worry, Bardo, I'll
take good care of it.

Start with his left hand.

How does it feel to be
on the other side, Bardo?


Brick Bardo: I don't know.

You tell me.


Brick Bardo: Screw left
the guts of his buddies behind

and took off to save this
grungy neck and that's

about all that was left.


I stole a unit from
the police garage

and chased his ass half
across the universe.

[Machine noises]


They played a little
rough for my tastes

so I gave them a quick
lesson in manners.


Drop the weapons.

Let go.


Brick Bardo: Her
name is Maria.

She reminded of a girl back
home except she was a hundred

times bigger.


Maria: I didn't
mean to scare you.

You are so small.


They'll be back.

Brick Bardo: I'm
not going anywhere.


She took me home to a pit she
shared with her ten-year-old son

and a bunch of noisy neighbors
who thought I was a freak.

I would have found a
way to beat the hell

out of there except
Maria needed some help.

Get away.

All of you.

Brick Bardo: She had
guts and wouldn't roll

over to some neighborhood
scumbags

who are running the streets.

What? Your little
friend going

to come over and beat me up?

Maria: Help!

Somebody help!


Brick Bardo: I
nailed them all.

It felt damn good,
like I was a cop again.

I had a thing for Maria but
it just wasn't in the cards.

Besides I was running low
on ammo so I said good-bye.


So I figured quiet
wasn't such a bad idea.

Ginger: Quiet where?

In Pahoota?

I think you came to the wrong
place, Brick, believe me.

I've got a story that
will match yours.

It even involves space aliens.

Only this one wasn't
shorter than earth people.

He just like to make
earth people short.

[Music with machine noises]

Guys from space wanted the music
and the babes that went with it

so they used the station to play
the intergalactic dating game.

And we were the bachelorettes.

The idea was to shrink
us down to portable size,

put us in their ship,
and take us home.

The first one to go was
Cookie, the waitress.

A very good friend of mine.

Then they went after Bunny.

They really played
with her mind.

Then they came after me.

Actually it felt kind
of good at first.

Then it got bogged out.

Before we knew it we ended

up in these tacky
little space bottles.



The DJ and some guys
from town fought the monster

and got them to return the
other girls to normal size.

But they chased them away before
they got a chance to rescue me.


Where's Ginger?


Ginger: That was
about as trapped

and alone as I ever want to be.

Help! Help!

I never real knew what being
lonely was until... until...

Brick Bardo: You're
not trapped, Ginger.

You're not alone either.

Ginger: I'm glad
you're here, Brick.


Ginger: Brick, behind you.

Judith Grey: Sorry.


So now I guess I'm Miss
psycho cop of the year.

Brick Bardo: How long
did they suspend you?

Judith Grey: Six
months depending

on the outcome of my hearing.

Brick Bardo: Does
your captain back you?

Judith Grey: Are you kidding?

He's the one that had me busted.

Brick Bardo: We had a
captain like that on Onteros.

He was a real jerk.

Every time he got
his ass in a sling,

he'd use me for the fall guy.

Judith Grey: Sounds like
we work for the same guy.

Brick Bardo: Except your pain

in the ass was bigger
sort to speak.

Judith Grey: So are
you going to help me?

Ginger: You mean hunt
down the possessed toys?

Judith Grey: I
didn't imagine them.

Ginger: Come on, lady.

This whole thing sounds crazy.

Toys that come to
life and kill people

to help a demon from hell.

Tell me another one.

Judith Grey: Okay.

Hey, how about a girl who
gets shrunk by a monster

from outer space and lives
with your alien boyfriend

in the kitchen drawer, huh?

Ginger: Ha.

Judith Grey: Do
you believe that one?

Brick Bardo: Ladies, please.

Ginger: She's already been
kicked off the police force

for being nut-so.

Said there was some chicken
delivery guy who fought the toys

with you the first time.

Why don't you ask him for help?

Judith Grey: I did.

He won't talk to me.

He won't talk to anybody.

He's... he's scared.

Ginger: That's convenient.

Judith Grey: It's true.

Brick Bardo: What
about your kid?

They might want revenge on
the both of you for screwing

up their plans a year ago.

Judith Grey: Yeah.

Well, I took him to my sister's.

He'll be safe there.

Ginger: You're acting
like you believe her.

Judith Grey: Bardo,
partner up with me.

You can go where those toys go.

You're the perfect size to
help me kick their butts.

Brick Bardo: I'm kind of
liking the quiet, Ms. Grey.

Judith Grey: It would
be a hell of a job.

But if you can't, you can't.

I'm sorry to waste your time.

I thought you might
still be a cop.

Brick Bardo: Wait a minute.

Ginger: Brick, don't.

Brick Bardo: I
am still a cop.

Ginger: I just don't want
anything to happen to you.

Brick Bardo: I can take care
of myself, maybe this lady too.

I just never had a partner
who looked like you.

Ginger: You're a little
compact for her, aren't you?

Brick Bardo: I
didn't mean it that way.

She's a cop in trouble.

Okay. You got me.

Judith Grey: Great.

Ginger: Actually
you've got us.

Brick Bardo: Wait.

I don't want you tagging along.

Ginger: The hell I'm not.

She might decide she wants to
play house with the Dollman

and I'm going to be right there

to show her who's built
better for the job.

Besides I'm nurse.

If anything does happen to you,
somebody's got to patch you up.


Brick Bardo: What's
the layout?

Judith Grey: Two floors

with an air conditioning system
running through the whole place.

Brick Bardo: You can flush
the toys out from one side.

I can bait them from the other.

Ginger: If they're there.

Judith Grey: We'll
see them soon enough.

Brick Bardo: If we
bust this case at all,

it'll square it for you.

Judith Grey: You
know, I don't even care

if the department
knows about this.

I just want to kill
those little bastards.

That's far enough.

Get the hell away from her.

[Suspense music]

You can do all this shit.

What do you need me for?

The first asshole
was just an accident.

We need a steady supply of blood
to reach our full strength.

I can get you all the
hookers you need as long

as you keep your
end of the bargain.

You're going to protect us
until we can summon the master?

Yeah. As long as he gives
me everything that I want.

No problem.

Believe me.

Your life's going to change.


Judith Grey: Quiet.

Brick Bardo: Get me inside.

I'll take care of that.

Judith Grey: Set.

Brick Bardo: Set.



Baby, you're mine.

[Suspense music]

This one's back for
another ass kicking.


Officer Grey doesn't
give up easy.

[Suspense music]

Ginger: They don't
look alive to me.

Judith Grey: Yeah.

Well, this is just kid stuff.


Brick Bardo: I
haven't been hunting

since I landed on this planet.

This ought to be fun.

Judith Grey: The toys
come in through that duct

so they can be any place
in the whole building.

Brick Bardo: So
let me in there

to meet the sons of bitches.

Ginger, you take cover.

Ginger: I'm no
wimp, you know.

Brick Bardo: Yeah, I know,
baby, but you don't have a gun.

We do.

[Gun shots]

Jesus. Who's out there?

Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Who?

Brick Bardo: Drive them back.

Judith Grey: They'll
stick their heads out again.

They love to play this
cat and mouse shit.


Hey, bitch, how
much ammo you going

to waste before you give it up?

Judith Grey: That
much, you little bastard.

Hey, don't fuck
with my friends.

I thought I got rid of
you, you crazy broad.

I'll be damned.

More living dolls.

Judith Grey: Put
the gun down.

Hey, I'm not sharing
this shit with anybody.

[Gun fire]

Brick Bardo: Nice
shooting, officer.

I wish I were 5 feet
taller, no offense.

Judith Grey: Thanks.

We don't have much time.

That was two of the toys.

But there's more and
they can go anyplace.

It's your turn now, Bardy.

Good luck.


Look out.


Judith Grey: See.

I wasn't kidding.

Brick Bardo: Hang
in there, Judith.

Judith Grey: Just
finish the job; okay, Bardo?

Brick Bardo: Count on it.


Brick Bardo: Wait.

This is no good.

We don't know this place.

They can jump out anywhere.

Ginger, we need to find
an advantage point.

Ginger: Look up there
where we can get out.

Brick Bardo: I can't do that.

Ginger: If we get out of
here, we could get some help.

Brick Bardo: I can't.

I made a promise cop to cop.

You wait here.

Look. I'll compromise.

I'll see what I can do up here.

You go [inaudible.]

Ginger: I don't
want to leave you here.

Brick Bardo: I don't like
the idea either, Ginger.

I really don't.

[Music/fighting]

Ginger: Brick, watch out.

[Fighting/noises]

Ginger: Brick.

Brick.

[Chasing noises]

Ginger: Brick!

Brick Bardo: Ginger.


Ginger: Brick,
up here in the bins.

[Chasing noises]

Why don't you join the
party in the next room?

Better watch that first step.

It's a killer.

Ginger: Brick.

Brick, get up.


Have a nice baby nap, Bardo?

Ginger: Brick.

Brick Bardo: I'm okay.

Are you all right?

She's a bit tied
up at the moment.

Brick Bardo: Ginger,
what's going on?

Actually it's more
like what's coming off.

you this is a party.

You might even call it my
bachelor's party before my big

wedding night.

Brick Bardo: Wedding night?

You heard right, shithead.

Me and the doll chick
are going to engage

in some marital bliss
and start a family.

Brick Bardo: What the
hell are you talking about?

You're a fucking toy.

That's right.

I'm a fucking toy and come
midnight that's exactly what

I'll be doing to doll chick.

But first I want
to have my party.

Let's start up the
entertainment, boys.

[Music playing]

I love it.

It's really going
to tear you up.


That's done.

This is the best bachelor
party a guy could ever ask for.

Brick Bardo: You said
something about midnight.

What's going to happen?

The master arrives.

That's what's going to happen.

Brick Bardo: The master?

Who's he? A fucking Ken doll?

That's real funny, jerk-off.

We've got a couple minutes.

I suppose I could tell you the
whole story before you split.

About 67 years ago on Halloween
night some dipshit tried

to give him a body by letting
the master do the nasty

with some bimbo.

Unfortunately they
blew it somehow

and the kid was born dead.

So being the real brain
trust that they were,

they had some rug rat trick

and treaters bury the
demon baby in the ground.

They didn't realize that some
day some yo-yos would build this

warehouse over the burial site.

For 66 years the master was
a prisoner inside the corpse.

Looked like he'd never
get another chance

until that pregnant slut
Judith Grey showed up.

Her holier than thou spirit
helped to fuck up everything.

That was a year ago and here
we are again, Halloween night.

The master says it's
going to go inside me.

And then the doll chick
here, she'll have a kid

and finally the master will
have the body he needs.

Oh, by the way, I got my baby
doll a baby doll nightie.

It's for later when we
make baby doll love.

Gentlemen, start your engines.


Looks like this is
the end of Brick Bardo.

[Eerie noises]

Brick Bardo: Run.

Get the hell out of here.

Split him a new asshole.

[Buzzing noises]

Grab that whore.


We're still going to bump
and grind, baby-cakes.


[Struggling noises]

[Suspense music]

Oh, now come on.

Baby.

Ginger: No.

Just relax.

Ginger: Stop it.

Take it easy.

Ginger: Stop it.

It's going to be fun.

Just think of it as
kind of a baby surprise.

Ginger: Get away.

Maybe sort of
like a little prick.


It's almost time for
your big bang, baby.

Put it on, cupcake.

I don't want to lose
the romantic mood.

Ginger: Put it on yourself,
you perverted mutant rat.

Fuck it.

You won't need it anyhow.

We're going to be

in our birthday suits
once we get started.


Brick Bardo: Eat this.

[Gun shot]


Brick Bardo: Pop
goes the weasel.

Hey, hey.

Easy. Oh, you like to struggle.

Well, I like the
rough stuff too, baby.

You know how babies love
to nibble on things.

Ginger: Stop.

Get away from me.

Get away.

Open sesame.


Witching time.

Ginger: Stay away from me.

Stay away.

And away we go.

Ginger: What?

It's happening.

I'm changing.


I think you'll truly
enjoy this, my dear.

Ginger: No.

Get the hell away from me.

Get the hell away from you?

You've got it all wrong.

I'm going to get
the hell inside you.


Too late, Bardo.

Drop the gun or I'll
kill the girl.

Brick Bardo: Bullshit.

You're not going to kill her.

You need her.

I've waited this long.

I can wait another year.

It depends on you.

Well, it seems your Dollman
doesn't think as much

of you as you believe.

Ginger: Don't
listen to him, Brick.

Now drop it on the floor.


Ginger: No, no.

Get over here.

Here's the plan, Bardo.

You try anything and
I'll break her neck.

Do we understand each other?

Brick Bardo: Yeah.

Now, tell you what?

I'll let you watch me do
the nasty with Ginger.

You'll be the first to
experience my human birth.

Ginger: No.

It will be a real
honor for you.

Ginger: Don't listen
to that creep, Brick.

Remember he's still just a doll.

How wrong you are, my dear.

I have all the tools
necessary now.

Ginger: All the tools.

[Gun fire]

Brick Bardo: Ginger.


Ginger: What are
we going to do now?

Brick Bardo: Call the cops.

Tell them Judith Grey died
in the line of duty and after

that we've got to find
our way back home.


Brick Bardo: Pahoota.

What? You say you
want to come here?

Brick Bardo: I
said Pahoota, pal.

What's the matter?

You don't hear so well?


Brick Bardo: Step on it.

We're a little short of patience
if you know what I mean.
