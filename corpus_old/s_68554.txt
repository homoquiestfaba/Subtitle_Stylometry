A crossing guard?

I almost trusted you.

Just a sec.

Sweetie, is that water
hot enough foryou?

Oh, it's fine.
Thankyou.

Stupid.

How many times have I told her

Seeyou later, sweetie.
Okey-dokey.

Ineverkeptbullets
in thegun. Honest.

Oh, no.

Ican'tbelieve
IaccidentallykilledDick.

Sure wehadourproblems, but,
come on, whatcouple doesn't?

Dick wasbasically
aprettyniceguy...

sometimes.

You wanna know another thing
I love about this little filly?

Not really.

The way she screams for me to call her
''puddle britches'' while we're in bed.

That's not--
That's not true.

Come on, it's cute.
You're cute.

So cute, I could
just chewyou right up.

Please. I just had
cocktail weenies.

Beforeyou chew me up,
I have to use the ladies' room.

So, Tina,
can I come back toyour place?

How drunk doyou think I am?

Guess not.

Hello?

Dick? Hello.

What am I gonna do with you?

Sorry. I'm so sorry.

Sorry.

Hello, 91 1 ?

I just shot my boyfriend,
but it was an accident.

I really don't think
thatjail time is a good idea.

That's not right.

Hello, is this 91 1 ?

Oh, hi.

Hey, listen, a stranger
just broke into my house...

and got my purse
and took my gun out ofmy purse...

and shot my boyfriend
and hid him in the basement.

That's not gonna work.

Hello.
Mom, I have to talk toyou.

Well, I have to talk toyou too.

What I have to tell you
is very important.

Well, Colleen,
mine is important too.

Is that Colleen?
Ofcourse it's Colleen.

Ijustsaid, ''Well, Colleen. ''

Tell her to watch out
for dust mites.

I have to tell you something...

very important about Dick.

Listen, sweetie. I just sentyou
some clippings from magazines.

You know, different hairstyles.

Some ofthem wouldlook
justdarlingonyou.

Oh, and some,
you know, diets too.

Tell her about the dust mites.

Sweetie, haveyou heard
from Peter recently?

No, Mother, I haven't
heard from Peter...

because he married my former
best friend, Pamela Grinder.

Remember?

Well, maybe ifyou wore
your hair differently--

All right, well,
thanks for the advice.

Bye.

I think she's mad.

This day was really
goin'down the tubes.

Itallstartedwitha visit tomylocal
alcoholicpsychic, Madame Hugonaut.

You have to believe.
Oh, I believe.

I see a man, a husband.

A boyfriend?
Yes, that's it.

And, well, he's going on a trip.
A very long trip.

No.
Yes.

He's very secretive.
He does not tell you everything.

Well, he's going to Rome.

I thinkyou're mistaken.
Dick hates pasta.

Mistaken?

Madame Hugonaut is never mistaken.

And your husband--
Boyfriend.

Whatever he is,
he's not going alone.

He's taking a young woman.

A crossing guard.

A crossing guard? No.

I seriously doubt that Dickwould--
Yes, a crossing guard.

I call them ''The Sirens
ofthe School System''...

with their long legs
and their bright blue eyes...

and the way theywave
those stop signs around.

''Oh, stop. Stop. Stop!''

Madame Hugonaut?

A few days ago...

he got into...

a mishap with a car.

Yes!

Yes. A fender bender
in the parking lot.

Doyou see the other man?

The handsome man
in the black car?

Idiot! I'll handle this.

What in the hell wereyou doin'?

Obeying the law.
What wereyou doing?

I was backin' out.
You were driving like a maniac.

Wow! Cool car.

-Colleen, mind your own business.
-You were the one driving like a maniac.

Yeah? Why don't we get
the cops here and see?

There's no need to get the cops here.
It's a little fender bender.

Oh, no, look.

See, your light thingy
is all crushed.

Doyou understand that ''mind your
own business'' means ''shut up''?

Why don't we leave her out ofit?

She's innocent.
She's cute too.

Stop trying to change the subject.

There's no subject, buddy.
I'm getting in my car, and I'm leaving.

It was nice meeting you.

Hope I run intoyou again soon.

I seeyour husband
and the crossing guard...

having an affair.

They're running offto Rome
together. Capisce?

Ifyou went home this second, you would
see her standing at the doorway...

with the bags all packed
waiting to leaveyou.

Mark mywords.
Go. Go.

That so-and-so
was taking my clothes.

I suppose his crossing guard
was my size too.

I could kill him again.

Hello?

Iknow who this is.

You verymeanlady! You'renever
going tospeak tomyboyfriendagain!

Who's thatyou're ringin' up, Daniel?
This woman I metyesterday.

Hope to run intoyou again.

Danny.
Hey, Sis.

I've got something to tell you.

-Jared, he's--
Danny!

Why don'tyoujoin me
in theyard?

Some ofthe boys have
a game offootball goin'.

Seeya, Sis.

Hey, Danny!

Would you be so kind as to favor us
with one ofyour beautiful songs?

Not today, Mike.
Come on.

Sorry, Mike.
I don't sing anymore.

Back toyour game, boys.

Did you rub Dick Rasmusson yet?

He ran into me.
What?

I was trailing him, you know,
trying to get a good shot at him...

and he backed into my car
not more than 20 minutes ago.

Did you rub him?

No, I didn't have an opportunity to.
He was with a woman.

In the name ofthe wee man, I asked you
to pop this guy over a week ago.

I need this to happen now!
I know.

I'll do it.
I'll ''X'' him tomorrow.

I transferred you from
the accounting department...

to the hit man department,
what, twoyears ago.

Yes. So?

So in that time, how many people
doyou thinkyou've actually killed?

Technically?
Sure, technically.

I don't know.
I'll tell you: none.

Rien. Nada. Nothin'. Zilch.

In twoyears, you haven't
doled out so much as a black eye.

Frankly, I'm disappointed.
I expected more from an American.

Senator Dove.
What about him? He's dead.

Senator Dove
died ofa heart attack.

He had a heart attackwhile I was hiding
in his closet waiting to kill him.

Not a true rub.
Areyou saying I'm yellow?

I'm not sayin' you're any color.
I'm sayin' maybeyour heart isn't in it.

Maybeyou should get back to accounting
whereyou don't have to kill people.

I can kill people
as good as the next guy.

Aye, Danny, care to favor us with
one ofyour beautiful songs today?

I haven't sang in twoyears.

Come on, Patrick. You know our Danny
hasn't sang since Mary broke his heart.

Ah, yes, the Mary incident.

Oh, Dannyboy

Iloveyouso

Could we please forget
about the Mary incident?

Jesus. Don't bite
the head offus.

We wasjust sayin' you could be
one ofthe great singers ofour time.

All the great singers are Italian:
Frank, Dino, Tony--

That'sjustyour opinion.

It's also my opinion you should shut
your gob! All great singers are Italian.

-Just like the mobsters.
You watch it, Tommy.

I'm Patrick.

I'm sorry.
You watch it, Patrick.

What did I do?
Notyou, Patrick!

Ifthe Irish can't sing,
then what about Bing Crosby?

Oh, forget Bing Crosby. The man
talked his way through every song.

What aboutJohn McCormick?
Yeah.

Our Danny can sing
as good as him.

Sure. He should be
up on the stage singing.

Yeah, I'm not a singer.
I'm a hit man.

And I'm gonna kill Dick Rasmusson.

I'll implement my new plan tomorrow.
What's that?

I'm gonna get to him
through his girlfriend.

Oh, whoop-dee-do.
Seems like quite a plan.

You're not pressing charges, areyou?
What a coincidence.

You and your boyfriend...

ran into me at Target.

Ex-boyfriend, actually.

Ex-boyfriend?
Yeah.

Things reallyweren't
working out verywell.

You are Colleen Gibson, right?

Yes.
The artist?

Yes.

I'm Daniel Gallagher.
I'm an art dealer.

I just thought I'd stop by
and take a look at some ofyour stuff.

Oh.
Can we go toyour studio?

I don't have a studio.

Doyou paint
down in your basement?

Well, yes,
but we can't go down there.

Why not?

Just 'cause it's messy
and there's rats.

But I'll tell you what.

I have other paintings in the garage
ifyou'd like to see those.

Sure.

Welcome to the
Colleen Gibson collection.

This is nice.

So, I call this one Red.

I see.

This is Green.

Makes sense.

Let me guess. Blue.

Yes. How'd you know?

A lucky guess.
You have a very distinctive style.

Well, yes, but...

as you can see, I'm sort of...

running low on ideas.

Yeah? Why don'tyou buy
a 64-box ofCrayolas?

I know art, and these are--

Well, they're pretty great.
They're truly neat.

And they're great.
They're really great.

Blue is my favorite one.

Mine too.
There's a lot ofblue in there.

Guess I kind ofdid it
in my blue period.

You know, like Picasso
had a blue period.

You know, I love his stufftoo.

Well, how much
doyou want for this one?

I don't know.
I've never sold a painting.

Two hundred dollars.

Sounds about right.

Thankyou.

I have one more thing to askyou.
What's that?

Out.
Out?

Out. I wanna askyou out, seeing
as your boyfriend is an ''ex'' and all.

Well, it'sjust that...

you know, the breakup
is still so new.

I'm just sort of
getting used to it.

Well, you have two hours
to get used to it.

I'll be back around 6:00.

I've got some errands
to attend to. Okay?

Bye.
Seeyou.

Who is it?
It's me.

Who?
It's me, Colin.

Sorry.
Howyou doin'?

I'm okay.
Good.

Where'd you get that painting?
I just bought it.

That sure is blue.
It is, isn't it?

I didn't want to leave it out
in the car in this neighborhood.

That would look really good
over the new sofa Mollyjust got.

How much doyou want for that?

Wanna buy it?
Sure.

I think I'm gonna keep it.
Sentimental reasons.

I'll giveyou 500 bucks for that.
Five hundred?

Yep. There is
a lot ofblue in there.

No, I don't know.
I think I'm gonna hang on to it.

Think ofit as
my retirement gift.

Retirement gift?
What, areyou retiring?

I'm goin' back
to get my genealogy degree.

Lot less dangerous
than this Mafia business.

You know, Colin,
we're not in the Mafia.

We're Irish.

You know what?

Just take the painting.
It's fine.

I know where I can get
another onejust like it.

Yeah?
Yeah, it's fine.

What doyou know?

I'm an art dealer
after all, huh?

I'm an art collector.
That's good.

Molly's gonna love this.
She loves blue.

That's great, Colin.

You Scotch-taped him to a chair?

Can you believe
I forgot the rope?

I had to use Scotch--
Look how sticky that is.

It sticks to the wool.
Yeah, it's sticky.

Hey, Pee Wee.
I'm sorry.

Wejust got caught up
in a little gangland small talk.

Howyou doin'?

Okay. Colin?
Yeah?

Let's do it.
Okay.

Let's do it.

Let's go.

Went to mass this morning, right?
Had my gun.

Then, a couple minutes agoyou came in
the door, and I gotyou with a painting.

Looked again-- gone.
Believe that?

You're offthe hook, Pee Wee.

Don't do it again, because--

No. Wait, wait.

One second.Jared said
we have to ''X'' this guy today.

We don't have a gun.
I know that.

But what I can do is
I'll find something...

with which we can bludgeon our
good old friend Pee Wee to death with.

I know this sounds
terrible, Dick...

butyour death...

has really opened me up.

Creatively, I mean.

Crossing guard?

Where in the world
did you meet a crossing guard?

Crossing guard, remember me?

Last week, back ofmy car?

That loose spring
took a chunk out ofyour ass.

Oh, you little siren.

You guys are cops, aren'tyou?

We are, in fact,
plainclothes detectives.

I knew it. I can smell a cop
with one nostril tied behind my back.

I myselfam a private dick.
Name's Dick Rasmusson.

You've probably seen
my television commercials.

Areyou trying to findsomeone?

Someone who's lost
ormissingorhiding?

Hello, I'm Dick Rasmusson,
andI'm aprivate dick.

Ifindpeople
who don't wannabe found.

Trying tolocate
an oldlover, friend...

husband, wife, child?

I'myourman.

You'reprobablyright.

I'myourman.
Callmeat 1-200-IMA-DICK..

That's 1-200-IMA-DICK..

Remember,
that's 1-200-I-M-A-DICK..

You guys here on some kind ofstakeout?
A prostitution ring or somethin'?

Nope.
We'rejust horny.

Like everybody else.
I'm workin' right now.

Doin' a little tail job.
The adultery thing.

I'm tailin' a big-time mobster.

Ain't nobody here
but us and that nurse.

He's not here today.
He usually is, though.

He comes here almost every other day
for a different woman. Fantasy thing.

Takes them to the Pink Flamingo for
the old ten toes up and ten toes down.

A real romantic guy.

Eitheryou fellas attached?
You know, lady-wise?

Ifwe were married,
doyou thinkwe'd be here?

Well, I got a girlfriend,
but I got a big surprise for her.

She's not gonna be
my girlfriend for long.

Why not?
Well, I'll tell you--

The sad thing is, I've seen his ads.
Me too.

And I kinda like 'em.
Me too.

Hello?
You over him yet?

Is this Daniel Gallagher, art dealer?
Youknowit.

I'll be there in an hour.

Found some murdering devices.
Gotta go.

That's nice.

Informants.
Always have the best stuff.

Not for long, though.

Okay, now...

everybody's gotta be real quiet
while I drive.

Just wanna say that this is your
first legit rub, and I'm proud ofyou.

Go get him.

Wait a minute.

You got any last requests, Pee Wee?
You want a cigarette or somethin'?

I've always liked the wayyou sang
''When Irish Eyes Are Smiling.''

Come on.

I don't sing anymore.
Come on, man!

You gotta do it!
Come on, Danny!

Hello? I just asked you.
That's what I want.

It's part ofthejob!
You wanna be a murderer now!

This once, okay?

That was beautiful, Danny.
Simply beautiful.

Thankyou. Thanks.

Sorry. It's gettin' late.
I gotta go. I got a date.

It'd be great ifyou could
play through for me.

Yeah. You were so close though, Dan.
Just bash his head in.

You can do it.

I got some things I gotta do.

And maybeyou could
tellJared that I did it.

Break the eighth?
The eighth?

The eighth commandment:
Thou shall not lie.

That doesn't sit
too well with me.

Right. Okay.

You'll do it though, right?
Yeah.

Okay. I'll--
I'll seeyou guys later.

Thanks for the song, man.

Yeah, sure, Pee Wee.

These are nice.
Thanks.

My set is shit.

Ifyou can-- ifyou can't,
you can't, but ifyou can--

right before I make contact...

let me know ifmy left arm
is straight.

You know what?

Whywould I waste a perfectly
good driver on your thick skull?

Molly don't love blue
as much as I love golf.

Wow. It's beautiful.

Come here tojog or fish?

Oh, my family. They like
to come out here and shoot.

Shoot?

Wow. An armed art dealer.

See that target down there?
Yeah.

Showyou how it's done.
Okay.

That's not that bad.

Wanna try?
Oh, no.

Not really, no.

Haveyou ever fired
a gun before?

Not really, no.
It's simple.

Youjust aim and shoot,
that's all.

Kind oflike hair spray.
Yeah.

Here. Give it a try.

Go on.

Thereyou go.

Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

I don't know.

Shooting targets sure can work up
an appetite. You know what I could eat?

What?
A big red, bloody steak.

I can probably arrange that.

So tell me more about Dick.

Where is he?
No, not Dick.

I don't even want
to think about him.

I'm just curious, that's all.
Like, where areyou sending his mail?

Why doyou ask
so many questions about Dick?

What areyou,
a cop or something?

I'm the opposite ofa cop.

An art dealer's
the opposite ofa cop?

No, I wasjust curious...

as to why Dickwould
leaveyou, you know?

I mean, you seem like
a really nice person.

Thankyou.
That's very flattering.

What doyou saywe go
start having a little fun?

Oh. More shooting?

No. No more shooting.

Somethin' more romantic.

You know what I don't
understand about Dick?

Oh, forget Dick.
He's gone.

You make it sound like he's dead.

I wish he were.

Hey, you know what
this party is missing? Music.

Oh, sure.
I've got some tapes in there.

What's this?
It says ''Me.''

What is it?
It's nothing. It's a secret.

IfI had a secret,
I'd tell you.

Areyou tryin' to tell me
you don't have any secrets?

You're changing the subject.
We're talking about that tape.

No dice.
I'm not above tickling.

Oh, no.
Please, please.

I used to fancy myself
something ofa singer.

Oh, cool.
So let's hear it.

Why not?

Because it'sjust not
a part ofmy life anymore.

It'sjust a stupid dream,
that's all.

Don't say that.
What happened?

I had this girlfriend.

Really serious girlfriend.

Her name was Mary.

She thought my singing
was silly, so...

she finally left me
for another guy.

I thought I'd change careers,
try somethin'...

more manly, you know?

Art?

Yeah, well,
I mostly deal in...

like really manly art.

And I don't sing.

Ifthat's the wayyou wanna be.
But I still wanna hear that tape.

Sorry.

I think singing is very manly.

Really?

Really.

So, please,
can I hear the tape?

Butyou have to promise me
not to laugh.

I promise. I cross my heart.
I hope to die.

Well, let's hope nothing
that drastic has to happen.

Oh, boy.

Oh, man.

Here we go.

In Banbridge Town
in the CountyDown

Onemorning lastJuly

From aboreengreen
cameasweetcolleen

You're good!

You're really, really good!

You shouldn't be an art dealer.
You should be a professional singer.

That's really sweet ofyou to say.
I'm not being sweet.

I mean it.

It's never gonna happen,
but thanks.

Never say never.

So I told you
one ofmy secrets.

Nowyou have to tell me one of
your secrets thatyou don't have.

Well, here's one.

I think I'm falling foryou.

I have another secret.

It's a little harder than
the ''I'm falling foryou'' variety.

What is it?

I know this looks really bad.

That's Dick. He's--

Wereyou gonna say dead?
Yeah.

I'm just gonna tell you
the whole truth, okay?

I killed him.
But it was in self-defense.

Well, I guess self-defense
really isn't the proper term...

but it was--
it was an accident.

Soyoujust pointed the gun
at him and bang, right?

Well, it wasn't that simple.

That's really--
That's amazing.

It's amazing.
Wow, what a coincidence.

Why doyou say
it's a coincidence?

You and Dick, you know?
And you killing Dick.

When you put it like that,
you make it sound so mean.

Well, hey, listen.

Dickwas a grade-A asshole,
Colleen.

I guess you're right.
Ofcourse.

Colleen, this is--

This is really great, but...

maybe not right here.

Daniel?

''Dearest Colleen,
sorry to leave so early...

but I had some business
to take care of.

I will be back soon. Daniel.

PS I took Dickwith me.''

I've been keepin' track.

Hi, Hurley.
I've been keepin' track.

This here's the 37th corpse that
Jared and the O'Reilly family boys...

left here in my dump,
and it don't make me too proud.

Don't tell meyou've accidentally
stumbled upon a conscience.

Well, recently I've been gettin'
a feeling that someone or...

something's been watching over me,
watchin' everything I do.

Maybe it's God.

Don't go all nutty on me
and the O'Reilly family, okay?

We payyou good money to useyour dump
as our private graveyard.

I know. I'm just
out-loud thinkin'.

Just out-loud thinkin',
that's all.

Hey, what variety is this?
Is it a snitch?

Turncoat? Some three-time loser
couldn't come up with the cash?

Private dick.

That's a first.
Why'd you plug a dick?

I don't know.
Jared wanted it done.

Don'tyou ask questions, boy?

What ifJared wanted your grandmother
done? Would you ask him why?

What areyou getting at?

I'm just sayin' I don't trustJared
any further than I can throw ajukebox.

And I can't throw
ajukebox too far.

Now why doyou figure
he wanted a dick killed?

I don't know.
Just doing myjob.

Maybeyou oughta think
about whatyou're doin'.

I'll think about that.

Have a nice day.

Oh, Hurley?

Ifyou see God around,
tell Him to have a nice day too.

Hold your fuckin' horses.

Hello,Jared.
It's you.

I did it.
I got Dick.

You don't believe me?
Go ask Dick.

I'd like to.
Take me to the dearly departed.

Areyou doubting me?
I'm doubtin' nothin'.

You and me will go look
at the dead fella...

then grab a bite
ofbrunch or somethin'.

Okay, but I wantyou to know
I'm hurt in here.

Ah, you're hurt in here.
I feel your pain.

Now...

let's you and me go look at
that dead body, hmm?

He's gone to the saints,
all right.

Goodjob.
Thankyou.

It's about time
I got a little respect.

Don't be so sensitive.
I loveyou like a brother.

Pay no mind to me.
I'm justjaw whackin'.

Let's get out ofhere.
I gotta dump Dick's car.

Hold on toyour pint.
Did you check him for dough?

Dough?
Backwhen I was a hitter...

I got an extra hundred a weekjust
from goin' through dead guys' wallets.

Typical dick. No green.

Some ofthese guys work their
tails off for nothin', you know?

Look at this.
One punch away from a free latte.

Some guys have no luck.

Doyou like them lattes?

Fair play toyou.
Only idiots like that stuff.

What else we got?

Jesus Himself.

An engagement ring.

The stupid bastard.

This guy's a regular
CrackerJack box.

What else we got?
Air tickets.

He was goin' somewhere.

Rome!
Rome, Georgia?

No. Pope-y Rome.

Come on.
Get me outta here.

So, why'd you want
this Dick fella killed anyway?

I wanted him killed
because I wanted him killed.

Is that good enough foryou,
question boy?

Come here. Here.

What is this?

That's an envelope, brains.
Inside is the prize: three names.

Windsor, Stuart and Tudor.
Who are they?

Three big-time drug dealers.
Oh, they're bad.

They stiffed me last week. I want them
turned into stiffs this week.

They hang out in the warehouse by
dock five all the time, playin' cards.

I'd like them killed
by the end ofthe week.

I can't.
I have things to do.

Like what?
You're a hit man. You kill.

No. Sorry.
Danny, let's face it.

You seem to have developed a nose
for this kind ofbusiness.

I need you, Danny.
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

Ayear ago,
what was your big dream?

What does this have to do--

You wanted to be a great Irish singer.
Here's the deal.

You make five hits for me, and
I will install you, as the headliner...

at the Shillelagh Room.

Shillelagh Room.

I don't wanna be a singer.
Ofcourseyou want to be a singer.

When I said,
''the Shillelagh Room''...

a wee light went on in your eye
I haven't seen in quite some time.

You want to sing.

Okay, okay, I wanna sing.

Ofcourseyou do.
So make the hits and get the gig.

What ifI don't?

Then I'll have to kill you.

Whereyou been?
I dumped him.

Dick?

Yeah, Dick.
Where?

Don't worry.
Nobody's gonna find him.

That is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

You know,
I never meant to kill him.

But he reallywas ajerk.

He was a liar.

You'd never lie to me, right?

No, I neverwould.

What am I gonna do about Dick?

We are going to act
as ifnothing's wrong.

'Cause when the cops come, and they
will, they'll come packin' questions.

Is there a social event or something
you and Dickwere planning to go to...

like a play or--

Well, I was planning on throwing him
a surprise party tonight...

but I guess that's
right out the window.

No, that's perfect.
Go ahead and have it.

But Dick is dead.
I know.

Who throws a party
for a dead man?

Somebodywho doesn't know he's dead,
right? Go ahead and throw him a party.

You're right off
the suspect list.

Now, where was I?
Oh, yeah, Colleen.

-I'm going to marry her.
-I wish I had some rice to throw atyou.

Take a gander at this.

Ever seen a rock this big before?

How can some two-bit gumshoe such
as yourselfafford such a luxury item?

Haven't been selling
your body, haveyou, Dick?

That big mobster I was
tellin' you about, the tail job?

He's got a wife who's willing
to pay through the nose for the truth.

And, ofcourse,
I don't have anything against that.

So I bought Colleen this ring.
Sounds like real love.

Call it whatyou want.
I call it securing my investment.

Not following you.
Colleen's worth a mint.

Or should I say someday
she's gonna be worth a mint.

Her old man invented
the rosy-red grapefruit.

I love those.
Once he kicks...

hervalue goes through the roof,
and I wanna get in on the ground floor.

I got an appointment with ajudge,
and then we're offto Rome.

Rome, Italy?

What other Rome is there?
There's a Rome, Georgia.

Who the hell would honeymoon
in Rome, Georgia?

I bet it happens.

Anyway, tomorrow I'm gonna
come home in the middle ofthe day...

when she's not expecting me,
and without saying nothin'...

I'm gonna play ''Leavin' On aJet Plane''
on the guitar.

Afterwhich, I'm gonna
ask her to marry me.

''Leavin' On aJet Plane''?

Oh, man, that's a classic.
I love that song.

Sad song for a happy occasion.

Admittedly.
It's the only song I know.

Maybe she'll thinkyou're
runnin' offwith anotherwoman.

Colleen's not that smart,
and even ifshe did think that...

she'd probably run offcrying.

You don't know Colleen.
Women are unpredictable.

Ifyou'll excuse me...

I have some compromising
pictures to mail.

I entered you.

Excuse me?

I saw a poster
at the grocery store.

You know that
radio station, WXI U?

They're having
a talent contest...

and the winner gets
a thousand dollars...

and a recording contract.

Colleen, I'm not ''singer guy.''

I'm ''art dealer guy.''

Butyou have
such a beautiful voice.

You have a talent.

It'd be criminal not to use it.

I can't.

Forget that old girlfriend.

Mary.

Yes, Mary.

Forget about her.
She's the past.

I wantyou to sing.

You have to believe in yourself,
'cause I believe in you...

and I don't want to be wrong.

Good.

Now that that's settled,
let's get some brunch.

I can't.
Why not?

'Cause I have to get rid
ofthe murderweapon.

Hey, cuz.

How did I know I'd find you drinking
in the middle ofthe afternoon?

I don't know, cuz.

I guess you're one
ofthose clairvoyants, huh?

Hey, how's the hit man
business doing?

Would you keep
yourvoice down, please?

Look, I got a favor to askyou.

''Mr. Fancy Pants'' has to ask
old ''Mr. Down And Out'' for a favor.

This ought to be rich.
Shut up.

Here.

A gun.

And to think those damn nuns
wouldn't letyou out ofseventh grade.

That's hilarious.
Wait a second.

Don't tell meyou finally
went and killed somebody.

Look, I need you
to ditch this for me, okay?

Why don'tyou ditch it?
You're the hit man.

I just sell sinks
for a living, remember?

Don't kid yourself, Rex.
You assist a man who sells sinks.

I can't ditch it 'cause
I have a lot to do today.

Why don'tyou have one of
your Mafia friends ditch it foryou?

How many times do I have
to tell you we're not the Mafia?

We're Irish.

Okay, okay. Take it easy.

Look, I don't want to get
involved with any ofthis crap.

Maybe this will alleviate
some ofyour fears.

Two hundred dollars?

Good.

Take the gun and throw it
in a lake or something.

Nothing's gonna happen
unless you screw it up.

Colleen.
Yeah?

I hate to be a party pooper,
but my legs are getting cramped.

All right.
We don't have to hide anymore.

Something must have
happened to Dick.

Can we eat the cake?
Sure.

I got it.

Hello?

Hi, Danny? You told me
to call this number at 9:00.

What?

You said to call at 9:00.
What the hell areyou talking about?

It's 9:00 and you said to call.

Oh, yeah?

Screwyou too, then, Dick!

Boy, you're not gonna believe this.

That was Dick.
He is at the airport.

He's running away
with anotherwoman.

Guess the surprise party's off.

Wow, look at the time.

Seeyou.

Night.

Seeyou.
Yeah.

Gosh, that was really smart.
It was, wasn't it?

Now the police won't suspect
anything when Dick turns up missing.

I don't know.
Something could go wrong.

No, nothing's gonna go wrong.
Everything is gonna go right.

We got awaywith it.

But I'm a killer.
Butyou're really good at it.

I am?
Yeah!

You should be proud ofyourself.
You're a natural.

Lots ofpeople can't do whatyou do.
Really?

Yeah, really.
Who's that?

I don't know.
Somebody probably forgot something.

Let me get it.

Hurry back.
Okay.

Yes?

You Colleen Gibson?

Yes.

O'Halloran.
Murphy.

May I helpyou?

You're on the wrong side
ofthe fence to be asking questions.

What side am I on?

The wrong side.
How well you know Pee Wee Greelitch?

Who?
-John Greelitch.

Nicknamed ''Pee Wee''
due to his immense girth.

I don't know anyone named Pee Wee.
Funny.

He knewyou.

At least well enough to be beaten
to death by one ofyour paintings.

What?

Just spill your guts
about Pee Wee Greelitch.

I don't understand.

Pee Wee was beaten to death
byyour painting.

Perhaps you could shed some light
on this interesting scenario.

Painting was blue.
Real blue.

I sold that painting.

I sold it a long time ago
at an art fair.

Now we're getting somewhere.
To whom?

I don't remember.

Ifthere's one thing I hate,
it's a poor memory.

He was a large man.

With brown hair?
Yes.

Brown eyes?
I believe, yes.

Perfectly round head?

Yes, it was a spherical-shaped head.
Damn!

That's Pee Wee all right.
You described him to a tee.

Sorry to disturbyou, ma'am.
I guess our hunch was wrong.

That's all right.

All right, ifthat's it--

Good night.

You were great.
You handled those cops like a real pro.

You really led them
down the wrong path.

I don't supposeyou can tell me why
the painting I sold you yesterday...

ended up in the head
ofsome dead thug.

I sold that painting at my gallery.

Where is your gallery?
It's down by all the other galleries.

I want to go.
Now?

Yeah, I want to go now.
It's closed.

But I assumeyou have a key.
Yes.

I have a key.

No.

You're not a gallery owner, areyou?
I don't want to makeyou mad.

You have ajob that's
gonna make me mad?

We have to go somewhere private.
Then I'll tell you.

We're in my house.
How much more privacy doyou need?

This is private?

I'm sensing something is wrong.

Yes, something is wrong.

I've had a pretty crummyweek.

I accidentally killed my boyfriend
because he was cheating on me...

and now I found out
thatyou're not an art dealer.

I can explain.
Areyou a porn star?

No!
Areyou a Republican senator?

Areyou in the Mafia?

Yes.

Yes, but we're not the Mafia.
We're Irish.

Areyoujoking?

I'm a hit man, but I swear I have
never killed a person in my life.

That's a good one. You're a hit man
who's never killed anyone?

Doyou think it's easy to admit
I'm a hit man who can't kill?

It's embarrassing.

I hopeyou see the irony here.
I am a hit man, okay?

I have never broken a law
in my entire life...

and you, the innocent artist...

just killed her boyfriend!

To compare my murder,
which was an act oflove--

Wait, oflove?
You didn't love Dick.

He sure as hell didn't loveyou,
but I do.

Do what?

Loveyou. Okay?

I loveyou.

You said, ''I loveyou.''
Yes.

I loveyou.

There, I said it.
I loveyou.

Really?

I dumped a body foryou.
I got rid ofa murderweapon.

Where I'm from,
that's love.

I loveyou.

Excuse me.

I have to go talk
to a wayward relative, okay?

What areyou doing?
Get rid ofthat thing.

No, listen.
I'm beginning to grow attached to it.

I think it has special powers.

Just get rid ofit
or I'll kill you.

All right,
it's gonna make Christmas...

real uncomfortable
for the families, huh?

Stop being such a dick.

Asshole.

That was fun.

I could do that
every night ofmy life.

That's a nice thought.
It's probably not gonna happen.

I'm in dutch with my boss.

How dutch?

Dutch dutch.
What's this?

They're drug dealers.
Scum ofthe earth.

They sell crack
to schoolchildren.

You're supposed to kill them?

Yes.

But I can't do it.

Yes, you can!

Yes, you can.
It's not that hard.

It's likejumping off
the high board.

Youjust have to decide to do it.

Sure, that's easy foryou to say.
You're a natural.

I can't do it.
I'd take the gun, and I'd...

point the gun
and it makes that...

horrible exploding sound.

That's all right.

It's all right.
You're still a good person.

AndJared, he's my boss
and he's my brother-in-law.

He threatened to kill me
ifI don't kill these people.

Jeez.
Think he's serious?

I once saw him stab a guy
to death with a soup spoon.

We'll just go run away somewhere.
SomewhereJared won't find us.

I have some family money.
He's gonna find us whereverwe go.

I just have to face the fact...

that I'vejust got
a few days to live.

But I'm gonna make them
the best few days ofyour life.

There has to be some way out.

I got it.

What?
I'll doyour hits.

No.
Yeah, I'll doyour hits.

I'm not gonna haveyou
do my killing for me.

I'd do anything foryou.

Come on, it's the least
I can do foryou.

Come on.

I loveyou.

Really?

Now, when you kill them,
you have to make sure they're dead.

Yeah, I know.
You told me that already.

Just make sure
to put a bullet in their brain.

You told me that already too.

And ifanything goes wrong--
I get the hell out. I know.

All right, give me the gun.

Give me the gun.

It has a silencer attached.

So I don't wake up
the whole neighborhood.

All right. I know.

I'll seeyou later.

Colleen.
Yes?

Just be careful.

Let's go get some dinner.
What?

Maybe Chinese or something?

Were they there?
Oh, yeah.

Did you--

Oh, yeah.

Areyou sure?
Yeah. Yeah.

Come on. Let's go.
I'm starving.

Whateveryou say.

''WallyLemon.:
kiddiepornographer. ''

Is this whereyou put Dick?

Yes.

It's fitting.

Oh, God!
What's wrong?

Look at my dress.

This is the third good dress
I've ruined doing thisjob.

Blood doesn't wash out so easily.

Don't worry about it.
We're done. You're done.

That's five.
That's the deal I made withJared.

Good.

Nowyou can headline
at the Shillelagh Room...

and win the WXI U talent contest.

Yes, and we'll be on...

Easy Street.

You know what I think?

Would you please stop doing that?

I think that day ofreckoning
I was talking about is coming.

I can feel it.

Who is that man?

Just a crazy old man.
Let'sjust go.

He's dirty.

It's gonna come.

That's it.

Five.

I'm through.

Here's number six.

No,Jared.

You said after five I'm done.

I meant after six.

You know, this whole...

killing thing--

It's really getting on my nerves.

Well, ifthat's the way
you want to play it.

You love Ivy, don'tyou, Danny?

What areyou getting at?

Be a shame ifanything
was to happen to her.

Besides, I thought
you'd want this one...

with this being the man that stole
away the lovely Mary's heart.

You want me to whack the Tuner?

Tony ''the Tuner'' Moretti
has been muscling in...

on my salmon-poaching racket,
and he has to pay.

See, life is fair sometimes,
isn't it, Danny?

Just do this last hit.

Pick up the envelope.

Saveyour sister.

Daniel, I really loveyou.

I just don't know ifI can
keep on killing foryou.

Colleen,just one last hit.

And we're through.
Jared promised.

All right.
What's his name?

Tony ''the Tuner'' Moretti.

DidJared tell you
why he wanted him killed?

I don't know why he wants him killed.
Hejust wants him killed.

Well,jeez, Daniel...

doyou ever ask any questions?

Ifthey asked you to go
kill your own grandmother...

you thinkyou'd bother to askwhy?

What areyou, a ''question-aholic''?
What's that supposed to mean?

Hello?
Danny, this isJared.

Yoursisterhadanother
one ofheraccidents.

The doctorsaidshe'dbe fine,
butyoubettercome outhere.

Okay.

I'll be there as soon as I can.

Hey, Ivy.
Doyou love me, Danny?

Sure I do.

Then killJared.

I don't think that would be
a wise career move on my part.

I want him dead, Danny.
He's fooling around behind my back.

He wouldn't do that toyou.

Stop taking his side.
He treats you like an idiot.

Doyou really think he's gonna
letyou headline at the Shillelagh Room?

How doyou know
he's fooling around on you?

I hired a detective.
Some clown named Rasmusson.

Who's apparently skipped town,
because I can't get ahold ofhim.

Anyway, he mailed me
these pictures...

taken at the Pink Flamingo Motel.

That's when
I took the sleeping pills.

He's doing a nun?

She's not a real nun.

According to Rasmusson,Jared likes
to go to this fantasy strip club...

and pick up these strippers
who dress in these kinky costumes.

All right.

All right.

I'll do it.
I'll rubJared.

Danny, that's the nicest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

Would it be fair to say thatyou're not
the best lunch companion right now?

I've been neglecting you.
I know it.

I'm really sorry. Let's try to enjoy
the rest ofour meal, okay?

Okay.

This is Mary, my old girlfriend.

Yeah, I know.

Danny, I'm sureyou know the Tuner.
Hi. Howyou doing?

So doyou want to sit down?

Wejust ate, butyeah, sure.

What, Tuner?

Doyou want to go to the restroom?

You want to use the phone.
Yeah, sure.

The Tuner--

He's gone to a dark,
secluded part ofthe restaurant.

Yeah. Alone.

I guess I'd better powder my nose.

So, how areyou, Danny?

Great. Fine.
How areyou?

I can't take it anymore.

It's so awful
living with the Tuner.

I never understand
a word he says.

He's so violent.

Unlikeyou, Danny.

You were always so gentle.

I guess I made a big mistake
when I leftyou.

Yep, I guess you did.
Yeah.

Is there anyway
I can win you back?

Use the phone?

No.

Just be a minute.

I'm sorry.
This is the wrong secluded hallway.

Sorry, Mary.

See, I found a really special gal.

I understand.
I guess this is good-bye, then.

Yeah.
I'm moving to Nebraska to find myself.

Yeah.
Great, yeah.

Did you--

No, I didn't,
and I want to go home.

There'sbeenamisunderstanding.

There'snomisunderstanding.

You're leaving, and you're never
coming back as long as you live.

You're not gonna visit me.

You're not gonna call me.
You're not even gonna think about me.

This killing is making you
a little bit temperamental.

I'm not temperamental, I'm mad.
There's a difference.

You asked me to kill
your ex-girlfriend's boyfriend.

That's not a normal
relationship request.

That was a coincidence.

Yeah, sure.

Just like the rest ofthem.

You'rejust using me
to get whatyou want.

I almost trusted you.

Good-bye, good luck
and get out.

And Daniel?

Yes?

I hopeyou do really crummy
at the talent show tonight.

Hi, I'm sorry to disturbyou, sir,
but did you know...

that the LordJesus Christ
watches your every move?

Yes.

Yes. You're a brother in the spirit,
just like me.

Forty-two.
Psalm 42 is one ofmy favorites too.

''The deer that--''
Forty-two.

There's 42 dead bodies
buried out there in thatyard.

You know what? Brother, I think
I'm gonna come back tomorrow.

There's 42 dead bodies out there.
Let go ofme.

You need to sober up.
You take me.

No! Let go ofme! Help!

Let go ofme, you fat retard!

That's it, hurt me!

Spank me!
Call me Cheesy-weezy!

Come on!

Sorry to interrupt.
Danny, what areyou doing here?

Now I see whyyou wanted
Dick Rasmusson killed.

All right, Danny.
I'll giveyou $2,000 not to tell Ivy.

Whatyou don't understand is you're
just my boss, but Ivy's my sister.

Oh, my God!

Put the gun away, Danny.
No.

Danny, I orderyou.
Put the gun--

You always told me the one
with the gun gave the orders.

Oh, my God. He's gonna kill us.
No, he's not.

He doesn't have the guts.

That's whatyou think.
You can kill him,just don't kill me.

I'm premed.
Shut up!

What is the deal
with crossing guards?

They're the sirens
ofthe school system.

You know what
your problem is,Jared?

You can't see what's
right in front ofyou.

What's right in front ofme,
Danny, is a dead man.

I'm talking about love.
Ivy loved you!

Who's Ivy?
Shut up! Love is a rare thing,Jared.

You ought to hold onto it
when you get an opportunity.

What the hell
areyou talking about?

I'm talking about killing you.
And her!

Go on. Pull the trigger.
You don't have the guts. Go on!

I will.
Do it!

I will.
Go ahead!

I knewyou didn't have the guts.

Who's been making your hits?

We're back.
You remember us.

Ofcourse I rememberyou.
We got an anonymous tip.

From some guy.

So I guess Daniel did find
a way to get back at me.

Excuse me?

Nothing.

This tip led us to ajunkyard.
Ajunkyard with 42 bodies in it.

All dead.
One ofthem was Dick Rasmusson.

A PI.
And one punch short ofa free latte.

Sad, really.
And his death too.

But here's where
the story gets weird.

A few days ago, me and Murphy
were in a strip bar.

We get horny like everyone else.
And we meet this PI.

A real clown named Rasmusson.
Said he had a gal.

A gal named Colleen.
A gal he was going to marry.

What?

Ofcourse, we didn't put
two and two together until after 5:00.

And that's quitting time.

You don't seem real surprised
that Dick's dead.

I am surprised.

I'm just shocked.

Don'tyou think it's strange
that one day some mob goon...

is killed byyour painting,
and the next day...

we're digging the body ofyour fiancé
out ofa pile ofpop cans?

There's even more.

We found this punk sink salesman
shot to death in the park.

And the slug the lab pulled out ofhim
matched the slug in the PI.

We haven't found the gun.

I thinkithas specialpowers.

Don'tscrewitup.

Oh, man.

Two bodies. One gun.

That's whywe want
to search your house.

Well, you'll need a search warrant.

First place we check in any suspicious
murder case is the basement.

All novice killers hide
theirvictims in the basement.

Some psychological thing, like burial.
I think it symbolizes hell.

It's burial.
Hey, cool, a guitar!

This thing's out oftune.

Probably has something to do
with this bullet hole in the back.

That would do it.
Hey, there's blood on this guitar.

A little vinegarwould take that out.
I'd use dish soap.

I hear the teakettle boiling.

That was a door locking,
wasn't it?

Yeah. I think so.

Did you do it?
Did you kill him?

Not quite.

But I detained him...

and when he wakes up...

he's gonna be pissed.

Soyou gotta get out oftown.

Two tickets to Rome.
Areyou coming with me?

No, I'm going to the talent show
to sing my heart out.

Then I'm gonna find the woman I love
and ask her to marry me.

Good-bye, Daniel Gallagher.

Welcome to the WXI U talent show.

I'm Dash Davis,
butyou know that.

Okay, tonight we have a lot
ofgreat folks here to entertain us...

and I am just standing
in the way up here.

So let me introduce
a bunch ofniceyoung men...

''Screaming Blood Monkey.''

Push!
Come on, push!

Bye, Daniel Gallagher.

And now, ladies and gentlemen...

getyour handkerchiefs
and yourwhiskey bottles out...

as here is Daniel Gallagher
to sing ''Danny Boy.''

Isn't that Daniel Gallagher?
One ofJared O'Reilly's boys.

What's he doing here?
I don't know.

Let's arrest him
and ask questions later.

Wait a minute.
What?

It's ''Danny Boy.''

Inpeace untilyoucome tome

So then I discover that not only
does he want me to bump off...

his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend,
he's gonna turn me over to the cops.

Probably so he can, you know...

live happily ever after
with his angel, Mary.

Wow, that does suck.
See, I told you.

Untilyoucome

To

Me

Thankyou very much.

Well, that's the big finish.
I better go plug him.

Thankyou very much.

That song is dedicated
to the woman I love.

Yeah, Mary.
Colleen Gibson.

Keepyour metal
in your pockets, boys.

I'm only here for one chicken.
Oh, Danny boy.

You can sing,
butyou sure can't kill.

I knewyou never made any ofthose hits,
starting with Dick Rasmusson.

Say hello to Saint Patrick.

Who areyou?

I'm Colleen Gibson.

And I'm a hit man.

Excuse me, pardon me.
Sorry about that.

And I'm a very,
very dangerous woman.

-Jared O'Reilly, you're under arrest.
For the murder of Dick Rasmusson.

I didn't kill Dick Rasmusson.

He did kill Dick Rasmusson.
He told me so himself.

A confession.

No, no, wait a minute.
I killed Dick Rasmusson.

I'm a very dangerous hit man!
She didn't kill anyone.

She's nothing.
Oh, yeah?

I've done it before.
What's one more?

What areyou so angry about?
Well, for one, there's Mary.

That's a nice place to start.
She means nothing to me.

Besides, she moved
to Nebraska to find herself.

All right, but there's also...

the anonymous tip the police got
about the bodies in the dump.

Sorry to interrupt, but the anonymous
tip was from a guy named Hurley.

Okay, so I guessed wrong
on that one.

All right, O'Reilly.
Down to the station house with you.

What happened toyour eye?

I was ironing a shirt,
and someone telephoned me.

I would never turn you in.
I loveyou.

You don't love me.
I do loveyou.

IfI didn't loveyou,
would I giveyou this?

It's not a gun.

Colleen Gibson,
will you marry me?

Should I kill you...

or marryyou?

Marry him!
Marry me.

I loveyou.
I honestly loveyou.

You said the most important thing
in the world is trust.

It's what every relationship is made of.
You gotta trust me on this.

I loveyou.
I loveyou with all my heart, Colleen.

You gotta believe.

I wasn't really gonna kill you.
I wasjust really mad.

That's understandable.

And the winner is Daniel Gallagher.

I won!

Thankyou.
Thankyou.

That's our show.
WXI U, I'm Dash Davis.

I parked out back
for the quick getaway.

Colleen! Greatjob.
I am so proud ofyou.

You know, you really do have
a gift for this whole killing thing.

I know!

Maybeyou could directyour talents
in otherways, though.

You know?
Something more artistic, less deadly.

How about opening a dress shop?
No.

I want to fence stolen goods.

People always like a good soap store.
Numbers running!

Flower stall?
Racketeering?

Anyway, no more killing.

But I'm good at it.
No more killing!

Okay, no more killing.

How about extortion?
