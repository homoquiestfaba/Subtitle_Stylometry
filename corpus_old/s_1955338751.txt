Vicky: [laughing] it's a
perfect night for evil.

Vicky, it's so dark and
creepy, i get scared at night.

Are you sure hawk is
going to be there?

oh, did i say hawk
was going to be here?

Oops, sorry, Ruby. - awww...

i must have been confused.

I meant to say there'd be a
giant guardian dragon here.

[sighing]

Vicky, that dragon
is gonna bust us.

I can't get hawk,
if I'm expelled.

â™ª

Vicky: we'll see about that.

â™ª

Cyrus: huh?
Ruby: huh?

relax and keep quiet.

I made this with ingredients
from potions class.

With this, I'll have the gate

and the power to get hawk
and whatever else you want.

â™ª

dragon: [gasping]



yes! with access to the gate,

i can finally initiate
my master plan.

Soon I'll be the greatest
fairytale villain of all time.

[snoring]

yahoo! hawk is gonna be mine!

Ruby, just be quiet.
You're gonna wake...

dragon: huh?

Ruby & Vicky: ohhh...

the guardian dragon!

Run!

â™ª

huh?

â™ª

snow white: today,
in dragonology,

we'll be focusing
on dragons' hair.

she's a guardian
dragon, you know?

you must be in control of
your dragons at all times.

All right, dragon, open up.
dragon: unh-unh.



now, laugh.

[gagging, laughing]

regularly check for cavities.

rose: that's amazing,
professor snow white.

dragon: [groaning]

class, pay special
attention to the teeth

and the bite on the dragon.

students: wow. [applauding]

one wrong bite and a dragon
could take your arm clean off!

[gagging]

[stomach rumbling]


so, pay close attention
to a dragon's mouth,

and always keep your eyes on it.

[gagging]


snow white: you know,
dragon breath mints

aren't the worst
idea in the world.

Dragon: [chomping]
huh?

[chomping]
oh.

[gulps]
did you just eat my apple...

After inhaling a thousand
apples this morning?

This is the last straw.
Give it back!

students: [gasp]

snow white: bad! Bad! bad boy!

huh?

joy: pretty spry
for an old lady.

Professor snow white?
Hm. look.

everything is ready.

good timing.
Come along, class.

We have a special announcement.
[chomps apple]

students: huh?

What could it be?
I don't know.

[groaning]

â™ª

Travis: whatever it is, i
hope it doesn't take long.

I wanna get home.

rose: really? I'd stay
in a fairytale land

24/7 if i could.

snow white: attention!
Attention, students!

[growling]
what's going on?

Why did they bring us here?

we have reason to
believe that someone

tried to use the gate
without permission.

So, for everyone's security,

we must increase the magic
walls on this area.

What?
Shhh.

until all work is completed,

no one can use the gate.

That is all.

wait, so, does this mean
i get to have my first

sleepover in the fairytale land?

hm? mm-hm.

that's so cool! Yahoo!

rose, wait a minute.
Rose, we have to...

Rose! - rose: [laughing]

rose!
Huh?

aren't you
forgetting something?

Huh?
Your parents.

They don't know you
go to regal academy.

uh-huh.

aren't they gonna flip out

when you don't
come home tonight?

ah... um... aw...

uh, granny?

rose's parents are
going to be worried sick

about her if she doesn't
make it home tonight.

We have to do something for her.

snow white: very
well, watch this.

[snaps fingers]

[magic whooshing]

snow white: mirror magic!

[gasps] is this gonna help me?

rose in mirror: hi.

Wow!
I help you, rose.

I'm rose. I'm rose. I'm rose.

Travis: oh, man, i think
she's found a friend.

[laughing]
rose in mirror: [laughing]

you are so real.

mirror rose, go
to rose's house

and take her place on
earth for tonight.

Mirror rose: yes.
So cool!

I can't believe how
realistic mirror rose is.

She even walks like me.

huh? - hmmmm...

[head bonks]
Travis: are you kidding me?

It's acting so weird.
[head bonks]

there's no way your parents
are gonna fall for that.

you're home early.

Did you forget your keys?

i have arrived in rose's
place on earth for tonight.

I'm rose. I'm rose. I'm rose.
uh, are you okay?

[head bonks] mm-hm.

[head bonks] mm-hm.

mom: honey, i heard a noise.
Was that rose?

Is everything okay? - mirror
rose: [head bonking]

yep, just rose being rose.

[head bonks]

cool! That is so me.


wow, you get to
sleep over here.

[laughs] hey, do you guys
wanna have a slumber party

at cinderella castle?

i guess so, but no
pumpkin carriages.

The last time, it
took me a week to get

all those seeds out
of my Ivy hair.

hawk: no need for carriages.

Travis &amp; rose: huh?

tonight, ladies,
you ride in style.

Yah!

rose: fairytale sleepover!

Come on! yahoo! [laughing]

astoria: i changed my mind.

The pumpkin carriage
was quieter.

rose: I'm so excited, i
think I'm gonna pass out.

cinderella: girls,
welcome to the ballroom

of cinderella castle.

Rose, are you feeling all right?

You don't look well at all.

[groaning] I'm great.

allow me to introduce you

to my other guests
for the evening...

Lots-of-legs and the
three Billy goats gruff.

[laughing]

they'll stay with us, too?

Best fairytales ever!

here we go again.

tell me how you
beat the troll.

hello, young ladies.

your grandmother invited us
here to practice our dancing.

cinderella: that's right.
They are my best students.

you dance, too, with
all your little feet?

oh...

i have so many questions
about all of this.

well, mm-hm.

those questions
will have to wait.

You three need to get settled.

Tonight is a school night,

and i know you wouldn't
think of being rude

by pestering my guests, rose.

aw, granny.

cinderella: that's
quite enough.

Now off to your room.

oh, my room! This is my room.

Pumpkin seeds, i
have a real bedroom

in a real fairytale castle.

uh, rose, haven't
you been here before?

oh, yes, joy, but i
do this every time.

of course, you do.

Vidal, off the bed.

It's not polite to jump on
someone's bed, vidal. okay?

Cinderella: [screaming]
all: huh?

that sounded like granny.
Come on!

â™ª

rose: it came from in here.

Granny, what's wrong?

Huh? oh...

wait a minute. so cool.

I'd love to see the
hall of shoes full.

it looks like just one
glass slipper is left.

[gasps] the actual
glass slipper!

the other glass
slipper is gone.

It hasn't been there in ages.

That's not the
problem right now.

This is something different.

A thief in this castle

has been pilfering
my collection,

and he took the great
majority of my shoes.

a thief? are there
any suspects?

maybe the shoemaker elves
who help me with my shoes.

Lately, they've been acting
strange and avoiding me.

no! i love shoemaker elves

almost as much as i love shoes.

It can't be them.

There has to be some way
to prove their innocence.

you girls need to let this
go and head back to bed.

I couldn't live with myself,
if any of your shoes...

I mean, any of you
were put in danger.

â™ª

rose: all right.
'night, granny.

[clock ticking]

rose: now this is
the fairytale life.

astoria: well, we sleep in the
fairytale world every night.

i hope you don't brush
vidal like that every night.

You're gonna spoil him.

Isn't that right,
my little king?

rose: did you just put
king on a satin pillow?

Hey, check this out! Go, gigi!

What makes tonight special
is that the three of us

are having a sleepover together.

you're right. So, what's next?

on earth, when we
have sleepovers,

we tell each other
secrets like...

when you were a little girl,

what did you wanna
be when you grew up?

oh, I've only ever
had one dream...

To one day become the
headmistress of regal academy.

me? i used to just
wanna find my prince

and become a bride.

[insect buzzing]

but now...
[insect buzzing]

[gulps]
[gasps]

but now i wanna
be a food critic.

rose: from the
time i was little,

I've always loved shoes.

I dreamed about being
a shoemaker elf,

and now i can't stop thinking
about the poor shoemakers

in this castle and
the missing shoes.

it doesn't seem right
to just blame them.

you know, I've
always wanted to

study shoemaker elves in person.

joy &amp; astoria: uh-huh.

oh. [laughing]

i think we need to go
solve the mystery.

yes!

I'm in, but i need
to bring vidal.

Dogs have excellent noses and
it might be a huge help.

Do you wanna go solve a mystery?

Well, guys, ready to
catch some bad guys?

Joy &amp; astoria: [gasp]
[whimpering]

or not.

don't worry, astoria.
I still have gigi.

I'm sure he'll be useful.

whatever.

Let's just get our regal armor,

or we'll ruin our uniforms.

rose: [laughing]

ah... hm...

you don't know how
wardrobes work here yet.

Wardrobe, wardrobe,
on the floor,

bring our armor to your door.

rose: oh!

dragon: [yawning]

rose: [gasping]

can't a forge dragon
take a nap in peace?

astoria: sure, after
you suit us up.

dragon: oh...

[breathing flames]

rose: ha, ha, nice.
Astoria: let's go.

[chandelier clicks on]

Mr. lots-of-legs, could you
come with us for a second?

it's nothing bad.
We want you...

all: hm...

[gasping]

Mr. lots-of-legs, we
just have a few questions.

not now, ladies, not now.
I've got this...

Uh, nothing important.

Nothing you'd be interested in.

rose: wait! come back!

uh, gotta go.

all: [panting]

all: [thudding]


the elves don't
like to be seen.

They work on the
shoes late at night,

and vanish before first morning.

okay, spill it. They're
good elves, right?

They could never turn bad and
actually hurt shoes could they?

who can say?

When elves get angry, there's
no telling what they'll do.

joy: well, that was
a lot of dead end.

wait. look at
what's on the ground.

It looks like ripped up
pieces of shoe leather.

no! those are
more of our shoes!

Who could do such a thing?

And here's a 2013 maryjane and this?

this was a vintage
1963 almond toe.

Ah! when will the hurting stop?

maybe it's the shoemaker
elves doing this, after all.

No ordinary thief would know
how to take these shoes apart.

Vidal: [barking]
that's my dog!

quick, back to the room!

Vidal!
[barking]

all: [gasp]

astoria: it's the elves!
Shoe thieves! get them!

what's going on? oh...

â™ª

can i come?
Rose: [gasping]

gigi: [squeaking]

ah, wait for me!

â™ª when you have
walked in my shoes â™ª

â™ª you can say you
understand me â™ª

i just wanna be friends.

â™ª while i can seem
to be confused â™ª

oh, there! come on, hey!

Please!

she's not normal.

come on, miss future
bug food critic.

rose: eeeeee!

â™ª I've got all i need

â™ª I've got all i need

what's this about a trap?

both: [gasping]

careful.

ack! ribbit!

â™ª i could lose it, oh

â™ª but i will not go

â™ª I'm right here on my feet

please, just take me with you.

I'm dressed for shoe land.

You know, shoe land, the
magical land of shoes!

Elves: [gasping]
rose: please wait.

â™ª watch me run my feet

â™ª i have everything i need

oh, such great shoes.

Just take me up to
your shoe land.

elves: [laughing]

â™ª I'm on my feet

â™ª yes i can

â™ª i am on my feet â™ª

hi.

either you let the
shoemaker elves get away,

or we just caught the
largest elf in history.

laugh, if you want.

I got the best souvenir
ever for my collection...

Elfie boots, elfie boots!

joy &amp; astoria: [laughing]

[loud clattering]
all: [gasping]

that came from
granny's office.

Let's go!

all: [gasp]

it's lots-of-legs. he's going
through your granny's desk.

What do we do?

get away, you thief!

him? the thief who
lost his shoes.

out of my way, ladies.

why would lots-of-legs
steal the shoes to wear

and then leave pieces
of them on the ground?

we should return to
the scene of the crime.

â™ª

All: [gasping]
what is that?

i don't know. But
i don't like it.

check it out.

[grumbling chatter]

oh, my, great. Let's
go get your granny.

[growling]


[heavy thud]

[grumbling chatter]
both: [screaming]

no! please, no!

Take the others, but
let me save the shoes!

seriously?

you finally caught us.

both: huh?

Billy goats gruff?
You're eating shoes?

Gross. why?

because we're Billy goats.
We'll eat anything.

kinda makes sense.

but why?

Why would you destroy
poor, defenseless shoes?

eating shoes is the ultimate
way to experience shoes.

when you wear shoes, they
just sit on your feet.

When you eat them, they
become a part of you.

forever.

makes sense to me.

eat shoe with us, child.

do it. eat the
shoe and join us.

uh...

Billy goats gruff: join us.
join us. join us.

oh, yum!

that's crazy.

astoria: rose, snap out of it.

gigi: [squeaks]

are you back with us, rose?

rose: yeah. Joy, get 'em!

â™ª

frog magic!

[magic whooshing]
all: [bleating]

yeah! [laughs]

oh.

[magic whooshing]

pumpkin magic!

[pumpkin thudding]

pumpkin, hold the prisoners.

get in there!

frogs: [grumbling]

all right, hold on.

I've been practising my driving.

[heavy thud]
rose: oops, sorry.

Oh, my bad. [laughing]

fantastic. We
caught the thieves.

and gigi was useful, so there.

and it turns out i
was right all along.

no, you weren't.

Literally, no one her guessed
it was the Billy goats.

oh, right.

â™ª

cinderella:
nicely done, girls.

rose: yep.

Now we know what happened
to all those shoes.

I'm sorry i was
in your office.

I was looking for lotion
for my leathery skin.

it turns out that the elves

were just scared of the
Billy goats gruff,

and with the goats gone, they
were able to buckle down

and fix all of my shoes.

thank goodness.

One thing. what happened
to the mirror me?

â™ª

[heavy thud]

[object shatters]

[chair clatters]

i think rose's new school
is really doing wonders.

i agree.

She seems quieter
and more dignified.

totally and more graceful.

[slamming wall]
mm, I'm okay.
