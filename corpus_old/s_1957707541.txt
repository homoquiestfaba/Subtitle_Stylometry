<i> (hazel)</i>
     <i> my name is hazel king.</i>

<i> Sometimes I look back</i>
      <i> on my past</i>

<i> and it feels like it belongs</i>
  <i> to somebody else.</i>

<i> But then it all comes</i>
      <i> flooding back.</i>

<i> And the girl I left behind</i>
   <i> isn't really gone.</i>

<i> She's just buried with him.</i>

<i>And I know better than anyone..</i>

<i> ...Nothing stays</i>
        <i> buried forever.</i>


what will it be?

What's in the tuna melt
     besides tuna?

Cheese.

Why don't you have
     garden burgers, hazel?

Because no one would
      order them, rudy.

Why won't you go out with me,
  hazel?

Because you're broke
    and unattractive, willy.

Is the club sandwich on rye?
 - Nope.

Well, I'd order the garden
      burger if you had them.

No, you wouldn't.
   - You're right. I wouldn't.

I'm not unattractive
        once you get to know me.

You're more unattractive
    once you get to know you.

Ah, that's what my ex-wife said.

Who do you think
        I heard it from?

What's the soup of the day?

Minestrone. Every day.

How can you call it
      the soup of the day?

I don't. You do.

I call it the only soup
     we've got.

How about garden meatloaf?
      Why don't you have that?

Okay, you fellas have
      been coming in here

two to three times a week
    since I opened the place.

Every time it's the same thing.

Willy wants to know
   why I won't go out with him

even though you know
you got a better chance

of banging carrie underwood.

And carl wants to analyze
the menu even though

you knows it hasn't changed
 since the bush administration.

And rudy wants to know
why we don't serve healthy items

even though you know
     you wouldn't order them

if you had to.

So, what'll it be?

Tuna melt.
       - Minestrone soup.

Bacon cheeseburger.

Fantastic. Javi.

What, diego hasn't
              showed up yet?

No.<i> Yo no soy</i> dishwasher.

[speaking in foreign language]

okay!

Anything else?
   - No, I'm good. Thank you.

Oh, stop. Get out of here.
  - Thanks.

Mom, you can't afford
to keep comping the cops.

A little goodwill can
           make the difference

between them showing up
  in five minutes or five hours.

Is travis going to order
     anything or is he just here

keeping an eye on you?

He's not like that.

Okay. Um, did you
             check back on five?

Steak and eggs.
Moving like he's on death row.

Alright.
      Well, you got more tables.

Four's having coffee
and two's sharing a donut.

Listen,
I need to ask you something.

You do?
            - Uh-hmm.

Can't wait to hear that.

Mom. I was wondering if I
  could get that college money.

Oh, are you returning
to college?

Well, yeah. Someday. Maybe.

Honey..

College money is for college.

That's why they call it
     college money

not hand-it-over-to-your
    tweaker-boyfriend

so-he-can-blow-it-all-in-
    vegas money.

I'm wasn't going to
       give it to travis.

And what makes you think
        he's a tweaker?

                 you're so evil.

We want to get a place together.

Over my dead worm-infested body.

I'm 19. We love each other.

Joy, his love
            will get you beat up

or knocked up or dead broke
     or all three.

You don't even know him.
        He's a good person.

And he doesn't have insane
      ideas about who I am

like I'm some sort of genius who
could make it through pre-med.

So, you're saying he swayed you
with low expectations?

Honey, come on, give yourself
   some credit, okay?

You made it into a great school.

Will you stop always trying
     to make me what you want?

You don't know me.
     I don't even know who I am.

You're my daughter.

And who's my dad? Hmm.

Are you ever going to tell me?

'cause I've been trying to
      figure it out on my own

but it must be some
           sort of state secret.

Please keep your voice down.

Forget the money.
      We'll figure it out.

<i> Anything</i> to get out of here.

My girls, too. At that age.
Always in a mood.

Why did you order 18 bucks
    of food if you had no money?

Another deadbeat.
       - Knock it off.

Can't pay your check?

I'm so sorry, um..

...No.

Lose it all in vegas?

I lost it all. Not in vegas.

      get that deputy back here.

Come here.
          - What?

Don't judge.

Unless you've lost everything,
 you can't know what it's like.

He's robbing you
and you're nice to him.

Go help table seven.


you know, I mean, she's not,
she's not wrong to be angry.

Well, I've never been
a thief before.

I just haven't eaten
in a couple of days, so..

You got anything? A watch?
      Pocket change?

No, nothing, nothing
that you would want, no.

Well, you're not
               from around here.

No. La.

Did you come in off the bus?

Yeah. Bus.

What did you do in la?

Cardiothoracic surgeon.

[utensils clattering]

I'm not a dishwasher!

Can you wash dishes?

Job pays minimum,
free meals.

Your bathroom will be
the men's room in the diner.

There's a outdoor shower
behind the kitchen.

I promise not to peek.

I'll take it.

Thought you might.

Hazel king.
          - Elliot.

Elliot morgan.

Stop!
          - Hey, hey..

Ah, it gets colder here at night
more than you might expect.

I-I'll bring you
some extra blankets

and a towel and a bar of soap.

She doesn't get it.

I don't fit in at college
       or anywhere around here.

The only place I fit in
         is next to you.

You know somebody's gonna
take that place out

from under us if we don't
rent it quick.

That money is yours, joy.

You better come up
with a way to get it.

Come here.
Alright, I gotta go.

Get outta here.
        - See you soon.

See ya.

[car revving]

some homeless guy eats your food
and can't pay for it

so you give him a job
      and a place to sleep.

Are you running a diner
or a shelter?

I don't think he's homeless,
   baby. I think he's just lost.

He could be a serial killer
   for all you know.

We probably won't
        wake up tomorrow.

We can't keep going through
  dishwashers like paper plates.

If I give him a place to sleep,
he's more likely to stay.

I don't understand you.
    - Oh, get in line.

You've known travis
       for two years.

He's the man
      that I want to marry

but you wouldn't piss on him
  if he was on fire.

You've known this deadbeat
    drifter a couple of hours

and answer his prayers.

I know people, joy. And
hopefully someday you will, too.

Leave those.
Give me your feet.

Really? Oh, my god!
      - Uh-hmm.

I was so hoping for this,
    but I was too scared to ask.


ahh!

About my college money..
   - Ah! Joy, not again--

I'm not asking
    for you to give it to me.

But maybe I could borrow some?

Nice try, but no.
       - I'll pay it back.

[car screeches]

[horn honks]

I said no.

And I assume my continuing
   to remind you

that travis will bring
     nothing but misery

will only drive you
       closer to him.

Definitely.

Great.

Hey, I need you at breakfast.

It's gonna be a busy day.

Love you, too.
        - Joy, 6:00 a.M!

[indistinct singing]

I tried.
Even said I'd pay her back.

She's hanging onto her fantasy

that I'm gonna be
the world's greatest doctor.

Maybe your family could--

I'm not taking anything
         from them.

They've got the money.
    - Yeah.

And they'd make me pay for it
   the rest of my life.

Okay, so..

If we got married right away

it could be mom's
wedding present.

[both laugh]

[car revving]

[speaking in foreign language]

but joy no love travis.

[speaking in foreign language]

a thing.

[speaking in foreign language]

did you just say when your
   cousin dated a chicken?

He dressed it up.
    Took it to<i> restaurantes.</i>

It was a thing.

What, like, a chicken?

T-the bird?
          -<i> Si.</i>

How is your cousin
       dating a chicken

similar to joy dating travis?

It really pissed off his mama.

Uh-hmm?
            - Yeah.

A chicken?

[knock on door]

you up?
            - Yeah.

We're gonna need
       all hands on deck.

Everybody's going in to
     vegas for the fight.

Let's go.

I'll be right..

...There.



I'll have the club sandwich.

No, wait. Scratch that.

What kind of cheese
     on that club sandwich?

American.

Why don't you have soy cheese,
 hazel?

Because it tastes like
     bubble wrap, rudy.

How would you feel about going
  line dancing with me, hazel?

Like a torture victim, willy.

What's the soup of the day?

Manhattan clam chowder.
    - Really?

No. Minestrone. Every day.
Which we've been over.

With the fat-free beans?

Yeah, sure. Diet beans.

Diet beans?
          - Diet beans.

Hey, I'm getting
        the hang of this.

We're falling behind out there.

Just go bus some tables,
    alright.

You, you want me to finish?

Let it go. Go!

Now, go.

You're late.

We went to the races
in laughlin.

You could have called.

I'm not a child, mother.

No, you're an adult and adults
have consideration.

That's part of what
makes them adults.

Why are you hiding the
side of your face from me?

I'm not.
         - Yes, you are.

No, I'm not.

That piece of shit.
      - It was an accident.

Javier, you're in charge.

Mom, don't hurt him.
         His family's dangerous.

[speaking in foreign language]

-<i> que pasa?</i>
         <i> - Su</i> boyfriend.

[speaking in foreign language]

bad news.

[dramatic music]

[music continues]

        'judge janice?
        Total screamer.'

dude. She's like, eighty.
    Moaner.

No, dude, screamer.
I can always tell.

Yeah, like hell you can.

[car revving]

hey, who's that?

Man, just keep your mouth shut.

I'll handle this.

Hey, travis.
       Can I have a word?

Mm..


I'm busy.

Won't take long.
       - What is it?

Can we talk in my car?

'why can't we talk right here?'

'cause I'd like to
        speak in private.

Well, what you say to me,
    you can say

to old conrad back there.

Damn straight.
        - Alright.

I came here to tell you that
  you're a walking argument

for birth control and you don't
have the balls or the brains

that god gave a field mouse.

And if you ever go
          near my daughter again

I will kill you and your
    entire inbred family.

Are you done?
      - Not even warmed up.

Well, conrad here and me
    was just wondering if

just by looking at a woman
you can tell if she's a screamer

a moaner, or she lies there
   like she's dead.

'now, I'm of the opinion
  that a-a fine looking cougar'

such as yourself has gotta be
  a world champion moaner

even though I-I personally,
   have never been

all up in your business
     to find out.

'can't say I haven't thought
  about that, hazel.'

so, what is it, cougar mama?

Are you a screamer? A moaner?

Or you dead?


what the hell?


get up!
         - You're dead!

Get up.
        - Bite me, bitch.


don't hurt. Alright, alright!

Get up.

You broke my nose, you bitch.

Yeah, I'm just getting st--
  - I'm calling the cops!

And that will be the last thing
you ever do.

Turn.
             - Oh..

Oh, my god!
          - Don't move!

Hazel, please just let me go.

Get in the car.
       - What? No, no way.

Get in the car or I will
    shoot you in the face.

No, my nose.

'wait. Hazel, hazel,
      I didn't mean to.'


[dramatic music]


now, be still.

Come on, sunshine.

          there you go.

You're alright.

There you go.

What is that?

[travis whimpers]

yeah. I know.

I know, I know what
           you must be thinking.

What a bizzare coindence

that a grave dug to the
     exact dimensions of my body

is out here in the
            middle of the desert

where nobody will ever find me.


no coincidence.

[travis grunts]

I dug this hole
      the first day we met.

Because I knew this day
     would happen.

I knew you would hurt
      my daughter

and I knew that I would
     then have to kill you.


you know, people think it's easy
digging a grave in the desert

but I'm here to tell you
    that's bullshit.

This took me two days.

There's nothing that
      a mother wouldn't do

to protect her child from harm.

And you...Are harm.


seems like a, a shame to waste
 such a hard dug grave

on your bitch ass, but..

...I can't have two days
    digging for naught.

So, here's what we're gonna do.

We're gonna find out..

...If you're a screamer

a moaner...Or dead.

Argh! Please! Please!

Wrong answer.

It was an accident. I swear!

Please, please, please,
   you don't want to do this.

The hell I do.


[door shuts]

    'that's right, baby girl.
    We're free.'

'we're finally free.'

[mellow music]

[instrumental music]

<i> - tu mama?</i>
           <i> - Si.</i>

I'll help you find your<i> familia.</i>

<i> Gracias.</i>

[music continues]

I want to know
             what happened, mom.

Travis and I exercised
a robust exchange of ideas.

And?

And he's leaving
the state immediately

and will never go
near you again.

No way.

Struck me as firmly swayed.

give me the keys to the bronco.

No. You're working.
    Or you're supposed to be.

I have to find travis.

No, you have to bus your tables.

Mom, what happened?

Travis said that he thought
it would be best

if he left california entirely.

You know who his family is,
     right?

They're criminals, like,
        violent criminals.

So be happy they're
not your in-laws now.

They're gonna want payback.

Joy, I am not afraid
of these people.

And I'm gonna do whatever
I have to do to protect you.

Then I'm going someplace
     where you can't protect me.

That's your prerogative.
   - Yeah.

You're damn right it is.
   - Language. Volume.

       did you even think
       for a microsecond

how kicking travis out of the
  state would make me feel?

I don't want that.

What is our mantra?
      - Ouch.

Say it.

"he raises a hand,
       I raise a fist.

He raises a fist,
        I raise a gun."

words to live by, baby.

Yeah. You get the gold star
   for parenting.

Joy, it's my job to teach you
   how this world really is.

Like your mom did?

My childhood is my childhood

which will never be
             your childhood.

I love travis.

You don't know jack squat
       about love.

That's funny coming from you.

Knowing that you've never loved
anyone in your entire life.

I love you, joy,
more than you'll ever know.

That's not what I mean
          and you know it.

Everything good here?

Great.

Hey.

You know that guy?

Nope. No, I don't.

It's my hobby.
           I, I love old diners.

Can I get you anything else?

No. Just the coffee. Thanks.


[dramatic music]

[horn blaring]


hi.

Hey.

You alright?
         - Yeah.

Fresh air...Bad dream.

You wanna talk about it?
   - No. Not really.

Goodnight.

'hang on a sec.'

umm..

...Joy seems to think that
    you're some homeless killer.


well, we all have our secrets.

Yeah, well, if yours come
       knocking on my diner door

like that guy taking pictures--

hey, I told you,
I don't know him.

Good.

Make you a deal..

...You tell me your secrets..

...I'll tell you mine.

Oh, that's a deal
         you don't want to make.

Look, I worked my ass off
       to build this place.

I can't have trouble.

You are not gonna get it.
Not from me.

Okay.
          - Goodnight.

Goodnight.

[dramatic music]

[car engine cranking]

[dramatic music]

[music continues]


who are you, what were you doing
in my diner this morning?

Freelance reporter,
       taking pictures

of your dishwasher, lady.

Why?
   - He killed his girlfriend.

Check the computer.

'drunk driving accident
     in la, 2016.'

he did four years
        for manslaughter.

Well, how is this news now?

Because before he crashed
  that car...Your dishwasher..

...Was a famous heart surgeon.

if I catch you in my diner again

I'll use your nuts for chilli.


[speaking in foreign language]

hang on, javier. Hold on.
   <i> - Rapidisimo. Gracias.</i>

Hey, the other day,
   you had a girl in your van.

Who's that?
          <i> - Que?</i>

The girl in your van?

[speaking in foreign language]

my cousin. She's shy.
    - Bring her in next time.

You want to keep having this
  conversation or help me cook?

           got dishes.

I'll have the patty melt.

No, wait. Scratch that. That.

How big is the patty
      in the patty melt?

Quarter pound. Butter.
   - Cooked in vegetable oil?

I'm going to the drag races
     this Saturday.

That sounds life changing.

Haze, could you do a kale salad?

Can you do an irish jig?

What's the soup of the day?

What I'm really thinking

is how I can ever get you
    to go out with me.

I'm not yanking your chain,
     hazie. I'm serious.

You might be surprised
     how good we get along.

I'm not talking permanent,
    just...Company now and then.

Get a dog, willy.

She didn't say no.

[joy sniffling]

here.

He knew it was wrong, you know.

Right away, he apologized.

Yeah, they do that.

Doesn't mean it won't
      happen again.

Mom, he's good.

He's so good.

You'd know if you'd just
    let yourself see it.

I'm sorry, baby,
    but good doesn't do that

to somebody they love.

I gotta get out of here.

Yeah, okay, you can clock out.

I wish I could clock out
    of my life.

   hey, don't talk like that.

Joy. Joy.

                 leave me alone.

[dramatic music]

[softly gasps]

phil.
      - Well, hello, hazel.

Long time.

I'd say about 20 years.

How you been?

Surviving.
          - Von's out.

How?

One of the counts got reversed.

Okay, when?

Tomorrow night, 9:00 p.M.,
   same place.

I'll be there.
     - Oh, I know you will.

Oh, isn't that joy, huh?

She's a beautiful young lady.

You did real good there.

See you soon.

Hey.
             - Hey.

Did you eat?
         - Yes.

Javier left some fried chicken
  for me. It was very good.

Very good.

Yeah, he's the best.

Is joy still upset?

For now.

Wel, it's hard to let go
    of someone you love.

Speaking from personal
     experience?

What are you guys talking about?

I'll let you ladies
       have your evening.

Goodnight. Goodnight, joy.
  - Night.

Loser.

Feeling a little better?

Trying not to feel
              anything at all.

Okay, let's get
something straight.

I'm allowing you to sulk.

Allowing me?

I don't need your permission.

Joy, you've had a shock.

But what's happened
       has happened.

And the best way to get over it
 is to plan for a better future.

Because trust me, little girl

I want you to get out of this
  town even more than you do.

Oh, after keeping me in
     a cage my entire life?

Yes, I made you study.

You made me the weird girl
 that nobody wanted to talk to.

Except for travis.
      - Oh, god!

Well, I'm not going anywhere
  until I figure out

what happened to travis.

Poof! He disappears!

And he just leaves his truck
    and his business?

And he doesn't call me, or his
  family, or any of his friends?

You know, the only possibility
  that makes sense..

Is what, joy? What?

Did you hurt him?

You don't actually believe that
I can hurt someone, do you?

No.

And for the record, I would
do whatever I needed to

to protect you, but I give you
my word, when I left travis

he was very much alive
and leaving california.

I believe you.
        - Thank you.

And I don't believe you.

I think he might be dead, mom.

Baby, he's not worth this.

Joy? W-where are you going?

'joy? Joy?'

[upbeat music]

[people cheering]

â™ª put it all on the line â™ª

â™ª put it all on the line â™ª

[cheering continues]

â™ª they see me.. â™ªâ™ª

hey.
    - Thanks for texting me.

I needed to get out.

What happened to your eye?
  - I fell.

If you say so.

So have you talked
       to his family yet?

They hate me.

Racist douchebags.

I wonder if they'll make
       a missing persons report.

They don't want the cops getting
involved with their shit.

Travis's dad is doing time.

So? They've all got records.

Well, we were gonna
    break away from all that.

You know, get our own place,
  make a new start..

God, I-I can't stop obsessing.


this is it, right here.

           get in on this. Yeah.

[siren rings]

oh, shit.
       Cops, let's go! Let's go!

Oh, shit!

Hey, joy.

Let's go.
   I'm here to take you home.

Let's go.

[fire crackling]

[car rumbling]

I owe you one, luis.
     - Oh, don't mention it.

That was the most excitement

I've seen on a night
      tour since, um..

Well, long time.

Uh, griddle's gonna be ready in
 about 30 if you want breakfast.

Actually, my partner and I
   really need to get back.

You know, paperwork.

Plus, my wife will have
  breakfast waiting for me, so.

Thanks again.


[keys rattling]

[speaking in foreign language]

again?

[speaking in foreign language]

where's yours?

I-I have no time.
I have to<i> casa.</i>

I'll see you tomorrow,
I have to go<i> casa.</i>

Okay,<i> adios.</i>
    - 'hey, see you, javier.'

[elliot sighs]

hey, boss.
Mind if I join you?

Yeah, sure.

so it's a hell of a day
today to be on our

on the floor all by yourself.
Are you okay?

No, actually, I could
         use a quadruple bypass.

Do you know of
        any good heart surgeons?

I've been googled.

You know that guy that was
      here the other day?

The one taking pictures?

The one you said
                you didn't know?

Yeah.

He's a reporter.

And h-how do you know that?

I paid him a visit.

What do you mean
      you paid him a visit?

You do know him.


[dramatic music]


yeah.

Yeah, his father
           was a patient of mine

and he died on my table and..

...Walter blamed me for it.
     Like a dog and a bone

he just keeps draggin' my name
  through the mud and..

      well, you know, eventually

I'm going to get my medical
     license reinstated.

The medical board is gonna
     have a issue with this so..

Well, I had a conversation
with him.

I might have persuaded him
not to run it.

[music continues]

you know the thing
           he never got right is

that they, they painted me
      as this rash, arrogant..

...Vain surgeon
      with a shiny career.

A fancy car, a beautiful fiance,
 but what they never get right..

When I asked her
   to marry me, she said yes.

Her love, it changed my life.

And I was so happy.

And then in an instant,
     I just...Boom.

I lost everything.

[music continues]

[clears throat]
               I'm sorry, hazel.

It's, I didn't mean to
     just take it out..

Dark road of my life,
   so thank you for listening.

It's like doing me a favor.
  - Sure.

I could actually use
a favor myself.

Yeah. Anything.

I have to go to vegas tonight.

For fun times?

            no.

I'm from there.
It's never fun.

Uh, joy..
           - Yeah.

If she does anything
or if anybody shows up that

you think I need to know about,
will you please reach out?

Yeah. Absolutely.

I should be back by breakfast.

Are you sure?
           You don't sound sure.

I'm sure.

I can never get out
of vegas fast enough.

[music continues]

thanks.

[instrumental music]

[doorbell buzzing]

heard you were coming,
but I didn't believe it.

        last time I saw you,
        you were in high school.

You were a lot smaller.

Yeah. I believe I was, yeah.

Uh, arms out for me. Thanks.

Alright.

â™ª I told my baby sugar.. â™ª

right on time as always.

Well, well, well.
      My little girl hazel.

Welcome home.

It warms my heart like
     a microwave to see you.

It's poppin' corn right now.

Congratulations on your release.

Who knew the world had
  little luck left in it? Sit.

You want a drink?
       - Uh, no, thanks.

No, no, no, no. You want
    some of my good bourbon.

To celebrate our reunion.

Did I ever tell you
       where I found

this little gemstone, phil?

Remind me.

Squatting in an alley downtown.
Hooked on smack.

'servicing salesman
      behind the el cortez'

for ten bucks a pop.

What were you, 16?

Fifteen.

But I saw something in her,
   same as now, no fear.

None.

A pure predator.

So I brought her home,
     cleaned her up.

Trained her for what
       she was born to do.

Man, did she prove me right.

Hey, phil, where's
       the burbon, huh?

My girl.

All those years...
   You never came to visit me?

Couldn't stand
      seeing you in a cage.


thanks for caring.
    - What do you want, von?

Our work continues.

Perry gamble is in town.

I need him...Met.

[instrumental music]

you must know a dozen
      other contractors--

I've never known a
  contracting artist like you.

And there's no one else
  who can get closer to perry.

I'm retired.

I'm...Rusty as hell.
   I got a bad back, bum feet.

Advance up front, per usual.

I can't do it.

I'm sorry. I, I know
       I owe you big time.

But I-I-I can't do it.

I won't.

You're worried about joy.

'a mother's instinct.'

'her boyfriend's disappeared,
  she's..'

'...Emotionally unstable.'

'god forbid she does
       anything reckless.'

that would be a tragedy.


[music continues]

I can never say no to you.

Perry's got a suite at the ibis,
he's only in town a few nights

so you have to move fast.
    I don't have to tell you

there's no room for failure.

And when have I ever failed you?

Good girl.

No. If I was that,
           I'd be no use to you.

[upbeat music]

mr. Chen? Perry gamble.
     Thank you for coming.

     'uh, let's talk
     in my suite, alright?'

[indistinct chatter]

[music continues]

[tap water running]

[door shuts]

[dramatic music]

hello?

Turn those off.



thought you were a burglar.

It's the only place
     where there's no drama.

Join me?

Yeah.

[instrumental music]

so...You made it home.
     Safe, sound.

Fun times.

Have some.

It's, uh, good stuff.

[exhales deeply]

             that..

That is the first alcohol
  I've had since the accident.

Oh, god. I'm so sorry.

No. No. I, um..

I've wanted to experience
       as much...Guilt and grief

and self-loathing as possible
  without anything

to take the edge off. See, I'm
 some sort of a-a champion

at numbing my feelings.

In med school, it was lithium.

No shit.

For depression and anxiety.

I was a heroin addict.

Jesus. When?
         - 'uh-huh.'

fourteen, fifteen.

No shit.

I just wanted to escape.
    Felt trapped.

Story of my life, really.

Always wanting to escape,
   but just ending up trapped.

I guess that's sort of
    what joy is feeling, huh.

Well, that..

...Is a feeling that I
    do not want her to have.

  that feeling can make a girl
  do horrible things.

Like what, hazel?

Well, let's just say that

I've...Secured the
   presidential suite in hell.

Actually, I would say
    that the only good thing

I've ever done is raise joy.

Yeah.

You got sober.

Yeah.

How, how'd you do that?

A benevolent master.

Only that ended up
       being a trap, too.

There was a time that,
     that I felt free

where I was raising joy, and
  starting the business, and..

...And the monsters were the
  ones that were locked up.

And you, how do you feel now?

It's okay, you know, the secrets
you tell in the dark..

...They don't count
       in the daylight.

[elliot clears throat]

goodnight, hazel.

I knew you were in here.

[instrumental music]

[music continues]

[shower water running]

oh, I forgot.

I gotta grab this. Alright.
  - Okay.

[clears throat]

well..

You promised not to peek.

That was before last night.

                      yeah.

How'd you sleep?

Not long enough.
       - Yeah.

Yeah, me neither.

Last night--
         - was awesome.

Yes, it was.

Umm...It was a first for me.

First time havin'
sex in your diner

or first time havin' sex
with one of your dishwashers?

One of those.

How about you let me blow
my first paycheck...On you.

Take you out, proper dinner?

Um, I can't. I have
           to go to vegas again.

Okay, well,
      another night, then.

Yeah, yeah, we'll see.

Mom.
             - What?

Customers are coming in.
   - Okay.

I'm gonna..
I-I'll see you in a second.

Yeah.

[upbeat music]

â™ª oh baby â™ªâ™ª

      ...Then the girl puts
      the silkiest piece

of otoro on my tongue.

I swear to god, the best
    I had in my life.

Whoa!
           - Watch it.

Oh, my god.

Hazel?
         - Perry gamble.

Damn, woman.
         What's it been?

A dog's age.

Ooh...Damn.

Still fine. Still mine?

You held up
           pretty fine yourself.

Girl, we gotta hang.

I-I-I got a suite upstairs.
   A-a view of the strip..

Um, no, I, I can't.

I'm-I'm waiting for everyone.

It's, it's girls night out.

Nah, we got us some
   serious catching up to do.

[music continues]

baby.

Okay. Yeah, yeah, we do.

Yeah, we do.

Come on.
           - Okay.

[hazel giggles]

damn, you look good.
     - Thank you.

And then when you karate chopped
that kid in the throat.

                        stop.

You're not supposed
             to remember that.

You know what? Enough with..

How is business?

Umm, a whole new world.

Yeah?
             - Yeah.

I'm almost completely legit.

You? Legitimate?

It's true.
          - Really?

On the inside, I developed
    relationships with people

who know people who have cash
  they need to park somewhere.

Substantial cash.

So...You're washing money?

<i> Investing</i> money.

Vegas is growing again.

Stadiums, tech hubs,
      arts complexes.

[dramatic music]

      'growth needs cash.'

and that's where I come in.

I am sort of a...Matchmaker.

Sounds legit.


you and me.

Runnin' and gunnin'.

Best times of my life.

Yeah, I know what you mean.

Why did you leave?

What?

That night. Our last night.

All those years ago.
      You just took off.

And I never heard
        from you again.

Until tonight.

I just had to change things.
  Everything.

Yeah, I guess I can
       relate to that.

But still..

...We shared a lot, you and me.

Yeah. You can say that again.

I've never had anything
     like that since.

Me neither.

Then why did you leave?

I mean, really?

Perry, I knew if I stayed,
   I wouldn't live to see 30.

I loved you, hazel.

I loved you too.

Ever since then I've
       been trying to find

that kind of connection again
  but I never have.

Me neither.

[instrumental music]

to us.

To us.


[knock on door]

I'm busy!

[knock on door]

I'm sorry. If he-if he
          knocks a second time--

yeah, go.

Sorry, boss. Mr. Chen,
       he wants you to join him.

'and he's insisting.'

      uh, tell him I'll be
      right there.

Um, my, uh, biggest
       chinese investor--

it's, it's fine.
     Go, do what you need to do.

Not gonna run away?

No. I'll be here.

[music continues]


I'll be back.

Okay.

           'let's go.'

[mellow music]

[music continues]

[phone chimes]


how's the storage shed, elliot?

It's comfy, joy. Thanks.

Bet that's not the worst place
 you ever slept.

You'd win that bet.

'what's at the bottom
of elliot's list of crash pads?'

prison.


mom, did you know
    that he's been to prison?

Yes. Can we drop it, please?

What crime?


vehicular manslaughter.

Told you he could have
     killed someone.

It was an accident.

A drunken accident?

Yes, joy.

[metal clanking]

I was drunk at the time
         of the accident

and at the death
             of my then fiancee.

             well..

...I'm sorry that that happened.

Thanks.

I was a husky.

U dub. I went there.

Really?
          - Med school.

Right.

Elliot was a
  cardiothoracic surgeon in la.

Prior to
    aforementioned accident.

Our dishwasher is
        a heart surgeon?

Bet you didn't see
            that coming, did ya?

   'joy was pre-med at u dub.'

for the eight months
       that she was there.

What happened?
                Why'd you leave?

College is a joke.

College is a racket.
     - Exactly!

Well, see, what you gotta do
    is you gotta figure out

that they're playing you,
and then you have to play them.

Now, if you want, I can
         teach you how to game

the entire pre-med curriculum
   'cause once you learn that..

...Then college is a breeze.

Okay.

What made you want
       to be a doctor?


um, I've always been broken.

And I thought that if
        I could fix other people

that I might be
             able to fix myself.

[mellow music]

did that ever work?

Yeah.

For fleeting moments.
           I guess it did.

What about you?
   Why do you wanna be a doctor?

I want my life to matter.

What matters more
       than saving lives?

[elliot chuckles]

that's right.

When you're right, you're right.

[music continues]

[upbeat music]

hey, phil, you remember me
      telling you about a punk

on the inside,
       begged me for protection?

Remind me.

He was so scared he'd vomit

just thinking about the showers.

Then he came to me.
      - You gave the word.

Nobody touched him.
      - Not a finger.

What do you think would've
happened without my protection?

[dramatic music]

nothing good.

Right. Nothing good.

All that stuff
       could still happen.

And worse.
       I saved her goddamn life.

She would've died
    in that alley if not for me.

And now, when I need her
 and what, she's goes straight?

I put you in there
              for a reason.

My reason. You understand?
  - I understand.

Yup.

I can't control her.
You-you have to understand that.

Don't you tell me
      what I have to understand.

All I can do is--
       - just shut up!

Time's running out.

I need to know everything
    she does before she does it.

Everything.

You will.
  - Get him out of here, phil.

[instrumental music]

can I ask about something
  you don't like to talk about?

Sure.

Are you in money trouble?

What makes you ask?
     - These trips to vegas.

No, uh, honey,
that's just business.

What kind of business?

Old business.
It's nothing to worry about.

You know, I do worry.

Even though I'll hate you
       until the day I die.

And I was thinking..

...If you need
             the college money--

what, no. I don't..

It's-it's just an old debt
   that I gotta pay back.

That's all.
          - Thought so.

It was either money
or a new man. And must be money.

Seeing how you and elliot are
such happy little bang buddies.

Young lady..

Don't even.
                It's so obvious.

How?

Well, for one thing

you can't keep
          your eyes off his ass.

It is a great ass.
      - It is.

Joy.
            - It is.


but it's not like you
      to mix work with pleasure.

That can get messy.
           And<i> you</i> hate clutter.

      'it's not messy yet.'

have you given
any thought to

what he said about
you going back to school?

Well, it's not like there's
     anything keeping me here.

So, is that a yes?

Don't get your hopes up.

I just haven't ruled it out yet.

I'll see you in there.
    - See you.

â™ª it's too late â™ª

â™ª I'm sorry.. â™ªâ™ª

he made his mole today.

Oh, then you know
               what I'm having.

Hey, hazel, how many
      people coming through here

every day would you
        say you know personally?

Well, probably half,
    maybe a little more. Why?

We're getting multiple reports
  of young girls gone missing.

You know, coyotes bringin'
them over to join their families

in the area,
and the girls never showin' up.

What do think's going on?
   - I don't know.

Could be a lot of things.

None of them good.

Yeah, hang on. Javier!

[speaking in foreign language]

...Missing girls?

It's very sad.

[speaking in foreign language]

they need to be protected.

If you see anything suspicious--

yeah.
      I've got your number.

Thanks.

             thanks for waiting.

Something to drink?

Wow.

   well, lunch just got
   a whole lot prettier, joy.

You were here the other day.
    You know my mom.

We go way back.

Way back to what?
       - I got this.

Four needs a check.
 - Introduce me to your friend.

And two needs to be cleared.

Nice meeting you.
       - Yeah.

I assume you have
               a message for me.

Von wants me
       to remind you that

perry leaves town
        tomorrow morning.

Well, you can remind him that
  I've never failed to do a job.

Ever.

He'll be glad to hear that.

Joy seems to be
       doing a lot better.

Joy is none of your business.

Oh, well, you see

that's where you're wrong.

Joy is very much my business
until the job gets done.

Clock's ticking, hazel.

[dramatic music]

hey, joy.

This is for you.
               Nice to meet you.

What did that guy want?

Nothing. Just some jerk
         from high school.


hey.

Hazel.

Hey. Can I help?
    - What? What do you want?

Can I help?
        - No. You can't.

Alright. Do you wanna
talk about it?

No, I don't.

       just need to think.

I just need to think.

I'm not your enemy,
           you know that, right?

Well, I don't know
     that you're my friend.

In fact,
    I don't know you at all.

Well, actually, you know

a lot more about me
than I know about you.

Well, I can't help that.
    I'm not as notorious.

Whatever that guy said to you
inside, don't take it out on me.

I warned you
     I'm not always so nice.

Yeah, well, you weren't kidding.

Okay.

You wanna know about me?
   - Yeah.

I am cold. I am calculating.
  I never drop a grudge.

And I always have an exit plan.

And everything that
    I care about is in there.

Joy. Javier. The people
     that I see everyday.

This place that I made here.

And I have to protect
     the people that I love.

Okay.
             - Okay!

Okay.

[instrumental music]



hmm.


I have to go to vegas.

Again?
          - Yes, again.

And with..

...Any luck,
         it'll be the last time.


look at me.
          - Hmm?

Hazel, look at me.

Look at me.
          - What?

I'm not goin' anywhere.

I'm right here.

[instrumental music]

it'll be okay.

'where you going?'


[instrumental music]


[instrumental music]

[music continues]

[knock on door]

ye-yeah.

Hey.

Can't sleep?

Wow.

You look, you look hot.

Uh, I can't.
      I have to leave now.

This late?
     Why are you goin' now?

Well, the guy that I work for
sometimes keeps odd hours. So..

Listen, joy's really
thinkin' about

going back to school

and, and I wanted to
 thank you for that.

           yeah.

Don't go.

Don't go.

[instrumental music]

whatever you
          think you have to do..

...Don't! Don't do that.

I-I can't. I don't,
I don't have a choice. Um..

And this, this is,
it's very sweet

but it's not happening again.

It's good.

And it's messy.

And I can't have clutter.


okay.

You're the boss.

Exactly.

[instrumental music]


hey. Yup.

She's on the way.

Yeah.

[instrumental music]

[gun cocks]

[music continues]


bellman brought this up.
  - Ah, okay. Alright, thanks.

You can't stop me! Get away.
 - Ma'am. Ma'am.

(male #1)
     'but boss doesn't
     want to be disturbed.'

I'm his wife.

Baby.

Think you could surprise me?
 - Who snitched?

Nobody can keep
     secrets from the boss.

You really set this up for me?

Baby. Baby. Baby, baby.

It's all for you.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.


[instrumental music]

[music continues]

he said he wanted to see me.

Alright. You know the drill.
 - Yeah.

What the hell hazel?
            Hazel, really?



help me get a bourbon, philly.

Ah..

It's hazel.

Check it out.
         - I got it.


[intense music]

[music continues]


[gun cocks]


[instrumental music]


hazel, what are you doing?

[music continues]

come on, honey.
   We can work this out, huh?

After all we've been through,
  it can't come down to this.

[music continues]

you're my girl, right?



I'm finally gonna be
      free of you.

We're a good team.

A great team.

Don't let your..

Don't let your emotions
   take you down the wrong path.

This is the right path.
     It's the only path.

You need me, hazel.

You'd be dead a long time ago
  without me.

And I'm the only one
      that's gonna be there

when you slide back
       into the shit.

And you know you will.

You think joy's
             gonna stick around?

Or elliot?
   - You think this is funny?

Elliot works for me.

If you don't believe me,
        you can ask him.

I own him like I own you.

You don't own me.


this is for mom.

And this is for joy.

And this is for me.

I saved your life.

The only good thing that
came out of what you made me

is that I can do this
and still live with myself.

Dad.


[instrumental music]

[horn honking]

[instrumental music]

[music continues]


[music continues]

[music continues]

hey. Morning.

[speaking in foreign language]

javier, how much
      do I have to pay you

before you get a new van?

That one runs<i> bien.</i>

How long you've been
      working for me?

Sixteen, no, seventeen years.

Yeah.
  - Since my youngest was five.

Since joy was two.

I'm gonna buy you
       a new set of tires.

No, no, no, no, no.
      - Yeah.

For your loyalty.
      - You don't have to.

[speaking in foreign language]

after all, if we don't have
loyalty, then what do we have?

[instrumental music]

honey, you don't have
   to do breakfast. I got it.

Oh, that's okay.

You had a long night
            and everything.

How did it go?
        - Good.

What about that debt?
     - Paid in full.

Get any sleep?
        - No.

Will you ever tell me
           about it someday?

Sure.

No, you won't.
        - No.

I love you, baby.
     - I love you too, mom.

(male #2)
            'psst.'

shh.

Hey, mom.
          - What? Yeah.

Can I borrow the broncho?
   - Now?

Some friends want me
to come over.

I won't be long.

What about break..

I'll have the denver omelet.

No, wait. Scratch that.

Now, on the denver omelet

can I substitute the
             ham for wheat germ?

If you hate yourself.

How'd you like to go to
         a john denver concert

with me, hazel?

I'd like that, willy.
     - Really?

Because john denver's dead.
  - Oh. Right.

Was the denver omelet
      invented in denver?

Phoenix.
        - Get outta here.

Uh-huh, in 1862, union general
 wade jefferson denver

created the, "denver omelet"
  in phoenix, arizona.

Well, I'll be damned.
     - I made that up.

Why would you do that?

To spice up the day.
I don't know.

How about
         a kenny rogers concert?

Also dead.

Of course.
           What's wrong with me?

Can you do an egg
            white omelet, hazel?

I could, rudy,
      but I choose not to.

Toby keith's alive.
      - His music sucks.

I don't even know
               what I want.

Me, neither.
         - Me, neither.

Okay.

For the first time ever,
    we're going to introduce

That's where I choose
      your meal at random

and you accept the result
    without complaint.

Okay?

Okay.

Willy. Sausage scramble.

Rudy. Blueberry pancakes.

Last but not least, carl.

Bacon and egg sandwich.
