Looks like they had a quiet night.

My army of souls.

Ready to travel to distant lands.

Was she crying?

No. She was awake.
They just need to be cuddled.

You spoil them.

Of course I do.

A spider bit me.

Shut up.

Wanna wash windshields today?
Thieves! Little bastards!

Beat it!

One-eye! One-eye!
Go fuck yourself!

Little thugs.

It's our turn to sing today.
Great.

I remember it. But that was
the year I had to leave.

You never got to sing it?

Just in rehearsals.
Mami was really sick.

It's better if you wait.

You need to wear your shoes.

They hurt me. They're too small.

Well, put them on
before you go inside the school.

He's so bad. He hangs out
with that gang that tortures the dogs.

Liar!

Shut up!

Take care of the stove.
And do what you can with him.

Which one do you work in?

The Posada Santa Marta.

Do the mothers leave you tips?

Not many.
But if you need diapers, it's heaven.

I've only got ten cents.

Tough shit.

Can you rent it?

How much?

Ten cents.

You don't bring it back,
I break your arm.

If you can catch me!

Six bags of trash I emptied.

People are so filthy.

Is she here yet?

As always.

Any problems?
214 as usual.

Not enough pressure in the shower
and the AC is too loud.

Witch.

They want to be mothers and they
can't even take of themselves.

Good morning, ma'am. Excuse me.

Your clerks said I should ask you
if there's any work.

Right now there's nothing.

I'm available right away...

Really, there's nothing.

I can do whatever.

I can cook, clean. I can...

If I hire you,
I have to pay the others less.

It's already tough for them
to make a living.

I understand. Thanks.

Is there somewhere else I could...?

I'm sorry.

A crazy woman.

Breast strokes
right through the ice cubes.

Must be the Aryan blood.

Her people are mostly Swedish...
Lutherans.

Buenos días. Rubén.
Buenos días. Sennora.

And will the ladies
be taking a liquid this morning?

And why not?

A fruit plate, por favor.
and a joo-go of orange.

It's jugo. Not joo-go.
Give me a break here.

You're so good at it.
I studied it.

Yeah, but you've got an ear.

I just sound like some old cracker.

It will arrive suddenly.

The children are so adorable.

You just wanna bake them
some cookies and give them a bath.

Morning, ladies.
Hi.

Our water sprite in her element?
Building her calorie debt.

Don't I wish I had one of those.

Is Eileen coming down?

We knocked,
but she said she's not hungry.

Ga"s missing a lot of meals.

She's on a budget... Eileen.
I'll say.

Woman gives two centavos
to some little beggar boy,

it goes right in that notebook of hers.

She doesn't bitch and moan
about the prices like some people.

Bargaining is a respected part
of the culture here.

If you don't complain,
they take advantage of you.

Besides, she's a professor.

She's in clerical.
At a university.

Which probably pays worse
than publishing.

I think her husband is between jobs.

Unemployed.

Actually, no.
I think he's freelancing.

He's looking for a job
and hasn't found one yet... unemployed.

So they lied on the application.

Or he got laid off after it went through.

Do you suppose the fellow back there

could do me up a pair of eggs,
over easy, so they're not runny,

but they're not scabby on the outside?

I will order it done.

And bacon... crispy, so you break it.
You don't tear it.

We will attempt to comply
with this, sennora.

And fruit plate?

You take the even ones
and I'll take the odd ones.

Excuse me. Socorro?

Right? Ascension?

I knew it was some religious holiday.

Buenos días...

Can I get another one?

They're Catholic.
So?

That might make a difference
down here with the agency people.

If somebody stipulates that the kid
has to be raised Catholic, yeah.

They can do that?
Why not?

Seems like under the circumstances...

Beggars can't be choosers.

I think that might be the motto
at the orphanage...

Maybe faith is different.

You must've told them
you'll raise yours up in your sect.

Religion.

And that child's parents
have no say in the matter.

She's been skipping dinner
a lot, too... Eileen.

Room service.

No, I don't ever see any trays
in front of her door in the morning.

Maybe we oughta find
a way to treat, then,

and just not make
a big deal about it.

Easy, easy now. You're so lucky.

You'll have a car
with its own little house.

You'll go to a pretty school

with all the Yankee kids.

You'll have perfect teeth

and a huge bedroom.

Let him breathe.

The expert.

My grandmother did this job,
and my mother, too.

They did it nature's way.

Nature's way?

Breast-feeding.

Wet nurses?

Right here.

Have you ever tried it?

Wash your windshield?

Wash your windshield?

She's only 30.
How can she be sick of men already?

That's what she said.
She's a dyke.

She is not.

She might as well be one
with the attitude she's got.

Have you seen her tattoo?
How can you see anything?

She won't wear a bathing suit
like a normal person.

It's an ankh.

What's an ankh?
Her tattoo.

Right, but what is that?

And where is it?
It's on her heinie.

How did you see it there?

What's an ankh?

She pulled her pants down for me.

I told you she's a dyke.

We were talking about tattoos
and she showed me.

Wes has got a snake

wrapped around a dagger
on his shoulder.

Your husband has a snake?

Am I the only one
who doesn't know what this is?

It's a symbol. It's Egyptian.

For what?
It means you're a lesbian.

Stop.

She says it symbolizes life.

I can't believe
they're gonna give her one

when there's so many of us,
with husbands, who want to adopt.

Oh, come on.

A child needs a father.

I grew up without one.

I had four.

Stepfathers.

My mother always said she hoped
the next one would turn out better.

Oh, Lord. I can't look.

That oughta be a crime.

They look pretty happy.
They're underfed, but happy.

Makes me miss my puppies.

What are they?
Jack Russells.

We raise about a dozen at a time.

My George can get them fed on schedule
and give them their shots, but...

...they need their mama.

I can show you
how to swim if you want.

As if.

You are afraid?
Fish urinate in this stuff.

You think I'm gonna
stick my face in it?

You are here alone?
With my posse.

With your mother.

I appreciate that.

You are a punk?
That would be stretching it.

You are a beach boy?
Student.

And this is like a field trip?

Have you been to a disco here?

We have a lot of club.

Everybody on the beach can see that.

Would you like to go with me to one?

What's your name?
I'm Reynaldo.

Sorry, Reynaldo.
I've got socks older than you are.

Good run?

Terrific.

We're just deciding whether
Leslie should have a kid or not.

Do you wanna vote?

Whoever she gets,
I hope they've got no sense of fashion.

I'm sure in New York she looks fine.

She's what, a proofreader?

Editor... fiction books.

She gave me one she worked on.

What was it like?

Kinda racy, lots of language.

Language?
Curse words.

She's gonna have to get an au pair.

Can she afford that?
She's in publishing.

If she is a lesbian,
she won't have to worry.

They'll have it all organized.

Mom...

The one in 214...

Don't mess with the shower.

But she complained.

This woman...

changed rooms three times.
She's done nothing but complain.

Wait for Herminio.

And clean your glasses.

We should take it apart and leave it
a few days, see how she likes it.

Great idea.
She'll be in my face, not yours.

Wait for Herminio.

If you're going to watch this crap,
you should get cable.

Leave it alone.

I can fix it.
You?

Who's done more damage
with those pliers

than with your Molotov cocktails?

I'd like to light...

214 up.

Listen, Mister.

We don't threaten our guests here.

Understand?

Why do we have to kiss
their imperialist asses?

They're our guests.

It's how we make a living.

And if you don't have a job,

the judge sends you back to jail.

You and Uncle Ernesto,
selling babies!

We provide a service.
A service...

for rich Yankees who...

Would you be happier
if the rich mothers came from here?

Parasites!

Fat, corrupt...

When I'm dead,
you can invite your terrorist friends...

fleas and all, to live here for free.

But until that day,

we provide food and lodging

of high quality
to those who can pay.

And clean those damn glasses!

She never got fatter,
which is a miracle

with the crap kids eat these days.
We had no idea of her condition.

Do you know what month you're in?

Maybe the second.
The third at the most.

They don't tell us anything.
When I was a girl...

Have you considered an abortion?

That's not an option.

And raising it?

She's barely fifteen.

There are a lot of mothers who...

Not Celia.

So what now?
We bring it back here

or give it up there?

We'll arrange that later.

And Celia... what do you think?

Consuelo.

That's your name for her, or theirs?

That's her name.

That she was given by...
By her birth mother.

We plan to change ours to Henley.

Your husband's name?

So they'll call him Junior?
They'll call him Henley, Jr.

You know, they can't say their J's.

You making fun of me?
No, really, it's genetic.

Leslie, don't be mean.

It'll be, "My name is Henley Yunior."

Which one do you like?

You visiting here?
Si.

I don't know what to buy.

Thank you.

Damn it!

You can't use that if you can't read.

It's mine!

That's really beautiful work.

I'd like something wider... cover this up.

Birthmark?
It's a burn.

Ouch.

That's how I learned what "hot" meant.

Knocked over the steam iron?

I was playing with the knobs
on the stove,

which my mother had told me
not to do a million times,

and she had a skillet in her hand,
so she grabbed my wrist...

God.

"You don't obey your mother,
this is what happens."

That's awful.

She never had to
repeat herself to me again.

Kids have to learn sometime.

Well! They saw you coming.

Is Herminio here?

Not yet.

I'll be in the bathroom.

Water pressure, my ass.

You ladies are braver than I.

Looks like Hemingway's rec room.

What's "sea food" again?
Mariscos.

What's the difference
between grouper and snapper?

Is there one?

I'll have a mojito with lime,
not lemon.

They know how to make 'em.

I didn't see any limes on the counter.

Una cola?

What did I say?
That you wanted a tail.

I'm hopeless.
Daiquiri, por favor.

Agua?
You didn't order bottled.

It's a restaurant.
It's in the guidebook.

Personally, I plan to get out
of this country with my plumbing intact.

Where's Miss Congeniality?

She's off to run a marathon
before lunch, work up an appetite.

She likes to keep fit.

And Hitler liked a parade...
woman is obsessed.

What's the name of that movie

where all the housewives
turn into perfect-looking clones?

Her husband is gorgeous.

You met him?
I saw a picture.

Hiking in the Rockies,
glowing with health.

She's very sweet.
She's upbeat.

She's been waiting here
longer than the rest of us,

and she's still got a positive attitude.

I trust her as far as I can throw her.

That's because you're from New York.

That's 'cause I'm from planet Earth.

Someday, one of her microchips
is gonna misfire.

You'll see the real Skipper.

She'll open her mouth,
this thing with six heads will come out.

There have been plenty of nasty things
to come out of your mouth.

Thank you.

Guess how many seafood places
called "El Pescadero"

there are in this neighborhood.

We ordered you
the bacon cheeseburger.

If it's 2:30 here, then in Virginia...

It's 2:30. It's the same latitude.
Longitude?

I have to call Henley.

Poor thing.

Yeah, house in Newport,
estate outside of D.C.,

boat bigger than my apartment?

They almost split up.
Jennifer and Henley, Sr.?

That's not the best time
to be adopting a child.

Maybe we should rat her out
to the agency.

Maybe raising a child together
will help their marriage.

My daddy always said
that children were the glue

that held a marriage together.

In my parents' marriage,
I was more like the hammer.

My mother used me
to bang dents in my father.

If they really are
on the verge of breakup,

I would hope that whoever
was providing the personal references...

Had the good sense to lie
when necessary.

How can you say that?

'Cause if you're clueless enough
to ask somebody

who'd slag you
on an adoption reference,

you deserve what you get.

The whole thing is such a game.

They're just doing
what they think is best.

For their bank accounts.

Why do you think
they've got us down here for so long?

They're gonna make us
earn our babies.

It's part of the balance of trades.
It's not like that.

I'll bet you two pina coladas her Henley
will fly down here some weekend,

make a donation
to Our Lady of Perpetual Red Tape,

and they'll fly off
with a little bundle of joy.

You sound so bitter.

I have been here over two months.

Pregnant women wait nine.

Yeah, but they get to throw up
and develop varicose veins.

Leaving Sunday with a baby.

Wouldn't that be awesome?

I called them yesterday and...

they said they'd let me know
if anything...

If you make yourself a nuisance,

they stick you at the bottom of the pile.

Well, you're not here, Henley.
I'm here.

No, I don't think you should call
the Korean people.

This isn't
the commodities market, Henley.

Right.

Right... yeah.

I just miss you.

You know, there's a lizard in my room.

No, a lizard, not a blizzard.

No, I said a lizard,

like a chameleon, a gecko...

A lizard. Yeah.

It makes this little noise
at night, it's nice.

Okay.

I miss... Hello?

I didn't say
they don't have papaya.

I said "papaya"
is another word for "pussy."

Pussy words?
Vaginal euphemism.

Beaver, clam...

Nobody here ordered clams,
did they?

The lower on the food chain you eat,
the better the nutritional value.

Though the risk of toxicity increases.

Thank you for sharing.

There is probably every disease
known to man down here.

Elephantitis, beri-beri...

The thing for all of us to worry about
are the infant syndromes,

like... where the mother
is intoxicated.

FAS.
And drugs.

Crack, all that.

They have crack here?

Then there's the genes.

What do you do about genes?
My point exactly.

You could adopt a ticking time bomb
and never know it.

It's the same with birth kids.

But birth kids, you know both parents.
You know family history.

In my family, sometimes
people are born with six toes.

On one foot.

People assume
that if they have kids,

they'll inherit all their favorite qualities.

If you get dealt a weak hand,

you can always train it
out of them, but it's work.

Roll up a newspaper.
I'm serious.

If they are born
with some kind of disability...

racial, cultural, whatever...
you make them aware.

They've got some catching up to do,
and you stay on their case.

I think you just watch them
and see who they are

and encourage what's best in them.

Mine had better be calm.
The one-neurotic-per-family rule.

Appetizers. Skipper, any damage
this is gonna do to my wellness,

I don't wanna hear about it.

Can you read this?

Sure. It's about a goat.
Will you read it to me?

Maybe later.

Look! Look!

Think we can sell it?
Did they use it?

If they did, nothing came out.

What is it?

If Mom had had one of these,
we wouldn't be here.

They arrange it all.

We just sign the papers

and hand over the baby.

Her?

Mute like always.

I don't think she understands
how serious this is.

Can I help you?

I need to buy jeans a size bigger.

Maybe two.

And this one?

It's cheaper, but it only pays
if all the numbers come up.

And then?

If you win,
you're king of the world.

I'll take just one.

No, gracias.

Ladies, ladies,
if you choose one of them,

the others, they go away.

How much is it?

Whatever you think
is reasonable is fine.

I don't know, what is this,
four dollars?

That is very reasonable.

Are you available?
Absolutely, yes. Always.

Blanca's learning to use a computer.

In school? They have that now?

They've only got one.
The students take turns.

So if she wants to go to the moon...

You need it for everything
these days.

To clean rooms?

The Royal Princess has a computer

that says which rooms are ready
and which need cleaning.

But the maids?

The maids just clean.

We're too old to learn that stuff.

Want to walk to the beach
if there's time left?

The waves scare me.
The waves?

I can't swim.

Right, you're a mountain girl.

I really think
Blanca's going to graduate.

If some guy doesn't nail her first.

We made a deal.

She graduates
without getting pregnant,

and I don't wring her neck.

My sister used to threaten
to sew me up.

It didn't work.

You think the American mothers
eat the same stuff we do?

Sure.

But they always want it
cooked without lard.

Are they Jews?

How long have you been a guide?

I'm not, but if you're with me,
the others won't be bothering you.

We appreciate it.
Thank you.

Your English is very good.
I wish that was true.

How did you learn it?
At the movies.

We have a cinema here
and the actors speak in English,

and... they...

They write under.
The subtitles.

Right. It's a very good school,
believe me.

If you're not a guide,
what do you do?

Now it's very difficult for us,

for all the people here,
and we have crisis.

We have economics crisis.

Politics as well.

We have had some trouble.
You're out of work?

Yes.

I was building houses and...

Office, schools...
Construction.

Yes, but that...

Business is not so good now.

It's a pity.

You girls...
are you here for your vacations?

We're adopting babies.

Sure. It's our greatest exportation.

They're gonna get hit on
whether we're with them or not.

Maybe they'll meet some Latin hunk.

They're not looking.
It's still good for the ego.

Are you... looking?

For a guy?
I figured I've given that enough time.

I better get this baby thing started
before I'm too old.

It's tough being a single mother.

But you've only got a fight
on one front.

You think the kid should go to bed
at 6:00, there's no big debate.

You're getting a girl, right?
Rebecca.

What's yours again?
We haven't decided yet.

I'm not gonna be one of these ones

where there's lots of choices
about the basic stuff.

It's gonna be, "Here's your
breakfast. Eat it or go hungry."

She's not gonna call me
by my first name

or have a cell phone
by the time she's 15.

Tough love.

I see these women in New York,

it's like their daughters
are their best friend.

They go to the same hair salon,
the same shrink?

Forget it. I wanted more friends,
I'd host a slumber party.

You think Zorro hung out here?

I'm not certain
what you wish me to do.

Your petition has been filed,

the placement procedure
is underway, so?

We're paying you.

I have to comply
between both your wishes

and the laws of my country.

So we do all the paperwork
and you just pass it on?

It may appear that way,
but I can assure you that everything is...

They said that we had to hire
a local lawyer or it was no dice.

That's one of the regulations, yes.

If you are unhappy, I can always
recommend you another advocate,

but to change at this point
might prejudice your case.

So you've got us over a barrel?

At this rate, the baby will be
talking full sentences before I get it.

I don't wanna have to undo all that.

Undo?

These are crucial months for learning!

I understand this.

What I want
is for you to move our file

from the bottom
of whatever pile it's on to the top!

Sennora...

If we receive our child by...

...the end of this week,

there will be some kind
of bonus in it for you,

on top of your usual fee.

The government doesn't
permit us to accept any kind...

The government doesn't have to
know anything about this, do they?

Unless, of course, there's someone
that you have to pay off,

and then you just let me know
the amount, and I will make sure...

I will pretend
you never suggested this.

Bonus or not, it's still your job.

Believe me,

you don't want my husband
to have to come down here.

I will do my best effort,

but I promise you nothing.

DOESN'T SPEAK SPANISH

It's Ernest.

Hey, brother. What's up?

The American ladies bugging you?

I'm here with a client,

a Nancy Hightower.

The one in 214.

She's a witch.

Rubén and the rest of them
want to poison her,

but she's paid up through Monday.

Two months, one week.

Could you live
with an early departure?

It would make you happy?

Get her out of here!
The sooner, the better!

I understand perfectly.

What did the judge say
about Buho's case?

That my nephew
is an enemy of the state.

Tell him Che is ancient history.

Okay. See you Sunday.

I have made an inquiry.

I was right here.
What did they say?

No promises have been given,

but your paperwork
is entering the final phase.

That's what you said the last time
I got you on the phone.

Yes, but this is the final phase...

...of the final phase.

I believe that your hopes
will soon come to fruition.

I'm sorry,
this is an inquiry from the Ministry.

Araceli will see you out.

So we have a deal.
If the Lord is willing.

Buenas tardes.

You must forgive us, madame.

But here we don't accept
American Express for our children.

But there is a cash machine
in the lobby.

Ministry of Human Services,
please, the Director.

Attorney Buendia calling.

You'll never get one
of our precious children...

even if you torture me to death.

Gonzalo, how are you?

Buendia here.

Listen, buddy,
I've got a big favor to ask you.

I'm allowed to visit the kids...

but only if her sister is there
in the room with us.

She doesn't trust me one bit.

Before, I would have flipped out.

But now...

now I try to think
before I say anything stupid.

That's all.

Thank you, Wilfredo.

And now, our visitor.

Would you like to say something?

I don't know how many of y'all
are gonna understand this,

but my name is Gayle,
and I'm an alcoholic.

You figure they had
a lot of hangings here?

Burnings at the stake,
your basic Inquisition-type stuff.

They had the Inquisition
over here, too?

Sure. It just happened
a few years later.

Kinda like The Beatles
coming to America.

Are you religious?

Not really.

For the interview,
I said I was Ethical Culture.

What's that?

If you're Jewish,
it's like the last resort...

Orthodox, Reformed,
Unitarian, Ethical Culture.

Gayle is heavy-duty born again.

She's not obnoxious about it, though.

She doesn't, you know, proselytize.

Oh, that's how you say that.

As far as I know.

Are you gonna send Rebecca...

Are you gonna send her
to public schools?

Sure, send her off
with crayons and a flak vest.

I'm serious.
So am I.

She's gonna have to bump up
against the real world at some point.

This thing where they're
interviewing four-year-olds

to get them into the right daycare,
so they get into the right prep school,

so they can get into
Yale early admissions?

It costs a fortune,
but it is your kid's future.

I figure if she doesn't absolutely
despise me by the eighth grade,

I'm ahead of the game.

At first the Spaniards
was inside these walls

and our people was outside.

Then the great general Jose
de San Martin arrived with his army,

and the Spaniards were beaten.

Thousands of people
was losing their life.

I thought you weren't a guide.

I was in school for some years.

This is our history. I have brought
my children here to show them.

How many children do you have?

Graciela, Eugenio, y Marisol.

Are they in school?

When it's possible, yes.

May I ask you,
which of the United States

you are living in?

D.C.

That's where the White House is.
Actually, it's not a state, it's a district.

Also, we have a place
in Rhode Island.

The smallest of them all.

I'm from Colorado.

Have you ever visited?
No.

But I have a great desire to do this.

Do you know
this city of Philadelphia?

Sure.

Someday I would like
to find a job there.

Why in Philadelphia?
It's the Cradle of Liberty.

I'll show you
where a dangerous piracy

was driven to the sea.

This way.

Do you think he'd be insulted
if I gave him more than four dollars?

Is my son good for anything?

He's still very young.

Young?

He's past thirty.

Age isn't just years.

Children are a curse.

I know. We've got eight.

Eight! How do you support them?

With great difficulty, ma'am.

His father gets mixed up
in politics, goes into exile.

I thought all that was over.

First the government
wanted to kill him, now I do.

Living with a Spanish girl
who's half his age, right?

The man is totally shameless.

Off playing the fool...

while I'm stuck with these...

whining mothers

and all the bills to pay!

Men get mixed up in politics
like it's no big deal.

Then get the military pissed off.

And who's left to order the linens?

This is better on my table,
but it's too bulky to bring down.

I'm okay.

Are you manipulating my aura?

Something like that.

You have to see
where the hot spots are,

where the energy polarizes.

That really deep stuff is sort of...

Don't worry,
I don't do anything too intense.

I think I feel something.

There's quite a knot in here.

Something emotional.

Do you do this on children?
Sometimes.

They get most of what they need
from, you know, handling.

Do you think that they can tell

if it's not their real mother
that's holding them?

You're gonna be the real mother.

If I were to breastfeed...

The idea of letting
someone else's suck on me.

I guess I'm not that maternal.

You're not a mother yet.

Now visualize an emotional state

and try to send it all
to one specific part of your body.

Like?
Why don't we try anxiety?

How'd you come up with that one?

Try to put it all here.

Do you think Henley's
too much of a load? As a name?

Names aren't so important.

He's just not gonna look
anything like his father,

and to have this whole
"junior" thing laid on him...

Your husband
must feel strongly about it.

Well, we looked through a name book.

We both really liked Joshua.

There's way too many of those.

We had a Joshua.

You had a little boy?

The first one was gonna be Cody
if it was a girl, which it was.

I was young enough.
We didn't ask for an amnio.

And you miscarried.

I've read that...
sometimes they end,

and the mother didn't even know
she was pregnant.

This was in the last trimester.

Oh, God.

That's terrible.

They said she,
they knew it was a she by then,

"She's not gonna be viable.
You'll have to carry to term."

So you had...

It was like a delivery,
but without the same spirit.

Nobody brings a video camera.

And with Joshua?

He was born with his lungs
not properly formed,

and with Gabriel,
it was his heart. Turn over.

There was another one?

Gabriel.

Did they both...
Lived.

Joshua lived about two days,

and Gabriel hung on
for a whole week.

They were incredible.

You're not drinking enough water.

What?
Your kidneys.

This tells me
you're not flushing well.

How...

I can't...

How do you get past that?

Losing...

...losing three babies.

Imagine that you're made of light

and that you're spreading
outward into a black sky.

Lie down.

Excuse me.
With your permission.

No, come on in.
You can work around me.

I'm writing to relatives
in Ireland... big family?

Me, too. How many?

How many?

Five brothers, four sisters.

There's nine of us.

Old-fashioned Catholic, I guess.

There were six of us.

Three older brothers,
but two are dead now.

And I take care of the little ones.

Whoever this little girl is
that I'm getting, my daughter,

she's got a roomful of cousins.

My daughter.

Listen to me.

Don't think I've called her that before.

Do you speak any English?

It's pretty weird, you know.

Because you have no idea
of who it is you're getting, really.

But you can't help have
these ideas, these... fantasies.

I have this day in my head.

And I used to daydream it

even when I thought
I could have my own kids.

It's early winter...

...and there's snow.

We get some serious winters
in Boston.

You don't have snow
down here, do you?

Snow?

A snowfall.

Like the state, right?

It's a day when there's no school.
It's a snow day.

And I let her sleep late.

And she's little,
but she's old enough to go to school.

She's third grade, maybe.

And I let her sleep late.

I come in, and she's this
little, warm bump in the bed.

And I say, "Darling, it's a snow day.
I'm gonna let you sleep."

You enjoy it more if you know
you're getting extra,

that usually you'd be up
and brushing your teeth.

Finally, she gets up
and she comes out in her pajamas,

and I make her cocoa with...

you know those little
marshmallows on the top?

And then we talk about
what we're gonna do that day.

And you can hear the snow shovels
outside crunching.

The plows rumble by every
once in a while, scraping the streets,

and it's still falling, so it stays
clean on top of everything, white.

Then I get her dressed...
all the layers.

Although now it's a lot less
with the polar fleece.

And she can do most of it herself,

but you help
because it's a pleasure.

Her arm on your neck
while she balances to put her boots on.

No thought of it.
You're just an extension of her body.

We go to the Common,
or we go way out to Jamaica Pond,

depending on the weather.

And she's just bold enough to skid out
away from me a little bit.

Shaky, but she keeps looking back
to see if I'm watching her.

She always comes back
to lean on me and rest.

And there's zillions of kids,
and they're all ages.

They're zipping around
and that makes her really excited,

but mostly,
she just wants to be with me.

Just the two of us.

And then later, when I take her
to Shakey's or Ground Round,

whatever seems like a big treat to her,
and I let her order french fries,

as long as she
has some of my soup, too,

and she tells me stories
about her classmates,

or she tells me stories
that she's made up, or...

...whatever.

We sit and we talk in the booth.

And we're surrounded
by other mothers and their kids.

And I am just one of them, you know?

And then later...

...when we walk home
from wherever I can park the car...

...there is the sound of our feet
on the new snow...

...her taking two steps to my one.

Then maybe if they haven't shoveled
the walk, like they usually don't...

...I go in front,
to break the way for her.

This is ignoring the fact that
I am supposed to be at work, right?

I'm the one with the job.

I have a little girl up North.

I named her Esmeralda.

She'll be four years old
on the ninth of April.

Maybe she lives where it snows.

Who knows?

I was so young.

I had to take care of
my brother and sister. I had to work.

The nuns...

they came to see me.

They said that...

it would be best to give her up.

Sometimes when
a new group of mothers comes,

I pick one.

A good one.

I try to...

imagine her face,

her voice.

When I think of Esmeralda

with her other mother
up there in the North,

I hope that my little girl...

has found a mother like you.

I didn't get any of it.

Excuse me.

I'm sorry.

Reynaldo.

Celia.

What's up?

Nothing much.

Zoila said you were looking for me,

with some big news.

Zoila doesn't know shit.

You still hanging at the beach?

No, I've had...

I've been sick.

Better now?

It'll be over soon.

Great.

We're going to Miami.

Who knows how long.

What do they have in Miami
we don't have here?

It's 'cause
my mother's old-fashioned

and has to drag me everywhere.

You look different.

The boss.

See you around.

I don't think so.

Who'd you rob to get this?

What's it to you?

There's not enough left
to buy doughnuts.

Forget about it.

Little shits.

I brought these.

They'll do.

A passport costs forty thousand...

with a birth certificate, too,
it's sixty thousand.

And the plane ticket?
That depends.

Toronto, Chicago, New York, Miami,
it's riskier but you get there.

If you want to fly to Mexico
and cross the border...

And Philadelphia?

No direct flights to Philadelphia.

Is there a way I can pay half now
and owe the rest?

What do I look like?
Come back when you can pay.

One, two, three generations
without a father...

or with one who's
unemployed or in jail.

Children need role models.
They need a dream to follow.

Instead we have
this permanent despair,

kids growing up with no concept

of work or responsibility.

This is why I won't go out
on the streets alone after dark.

Sure, there were excesses
in the past,

but when I was a girl,
we had a sense of dignity.

Now, this is more like it.

How many stars are next to this
in the guidebook?

We'll be fine as long as you
don't get into the wine list.

I'm treating.
Come on.

No, I want to.

No...
I don't... no.

One last drink and that's it.
It's ridiculous.

Nobody here wants them.
And why not?

Because they've fucked us
from every angle...

economically, psychologically,
politically.

It's more than just them.

Another round, please!

Imagine our lives
if they just disappeared.

How come they need so many?

Can't they breed their own?

They're too busy making money
to procreate.

Or maybe it's their technology.

I don't trust those microwaves.

It's just another form
of cultural imperialism.

We supply the raw material
and they refine it.

You think they'd let us
bring their kids here?

Lots of opportunity up there.
For whites only.

Hector, my Cuban friend,

he was in Panama
when they kidnapped Noriega.

Too bad they didn't kill him.

And he told me

that the Yankee invaders...

were from every race!

Chinese, Latinos, Blacks, Whites.

Exactly my point.

That's where I'm heading!
That's what I'm saying, too!

If it comes to a showdown...

the little bastards shooting at us
will be our own.

An order of cheese empanadas
for two...

chicken soup...

roast pork with rice.

And two margaritas.

Les.

I'm sorry, I forgot.

I'm sorry.

Make that one margarita
and one pina colada

without rum.

Without rum.

Twenty minutes.

I'll start timing them in half an hour.

No big hurry.

Do you think the others
think we're being anti-social?

There's no rule that says
we have to do everything in a group.

Of course, if the dog lady
and Miss Triathlon weren't here...

Skipper is a good person.

You cut people a lot of slack.

It's just her...

...her exterior is a bit intimidating.

Did you order the cheese thingies,
the turnovers?

But of course.

I eat any more cheese,
I might never poop again.

I got the opposite problem.
Still?

I know the location
of every flush toilet in South America.

Their stuff is worse than our stuff.

I just wish I could speak it like you do.

You don't need to understand
the words to watch TV.

Stupidity is the universal language.

She was
a Communications major... Nan.

That's news.
At Kansas State.

She told me she went to
the University of Missouri,

majored in Political Science.

What did she tell you
her husband does for a living?

Engineer.

High school chemistry teacher.

You're kidding.

"They get through a year
with my George,

they know that periodic table
backwards and forwards."

Wow.

If I tell you something,
you promise not to pass it on?

Only if it's really juicy.
She steals.

Steals what?

Off the maids' carts.

I've seen her take a half dozen
of those shampoos, soaps,

those little mints
they put on our pillow at night.

You're shitting me.

She just fills her pockets with them.

I suppose she assumes it's her right.

It's... furtive.

Furtive. I love it.

I was halfway down in the stairs,

so she didn't know I saw her,
but she just looked both ways,

and she just dug right in.

And everything is so cheap down here.

She always seems so in control.

Most of your serial killers
are totally methodical.

Come on.

I know you guys
aren't supposed to dis anybody,

but you gotta admit,
she's a sociopath.

Is that anything like a psychopath?
With a lower body count, yeah.

Then why are we letting her
have a child?

You have to know
how to handle these people.

They've got an inferiority complex.

Lord knows
they have reason to have one,

but you have to know
what's bark and what's bite.

You don't think every one of us
couldn't have finished our business

and been long gone by now?

They just wanna hold your feet
to the fire a little,

make the gringos squirm.

That's exactly how I felt when they were
doing all that fertility testing.

Like they were making up new stuff
just to try on me.

I had two operations.

One was a tubal ligation
and this other thing.

I never totally understood the point.

Nothing, right?
It must work for somebody.

It works for the doctors.

You don't wanna know
what those bastards put me through.

They had me on this stuff
with nun's pee in it.

Is this a regular doctor?
Italian nun's pee?

It has some kind of a hormone?

From women of a certain age
who haven't been sexually active.

I've read about it.
It's a racket.

They tried to talk my George
into some business with his gonads.

I thought he was
going to choke the intern.

Here we go.
London broil, baked potato.

I think we scored, ladies.

We could say something.
To who?

To the people at the agency down here.
That would go down real well.

"In light of the persistent and malicious
disappearance of our pillow mints,

we the undersigned..."

So what do we do?

I don't know.

Be really good mothers to ours.

Pray for Rosemary's baby.

This is serious.
I know.

It's life, though.

Do you know how many manuscripts
we get submitted every year

where the basic story
is the mom's a fruitcake?

It's a whole genre.

So, we're what,
afraid to rock the boat,

get the ministry riled up,

throw a little hitch
into that adoption schedule?

We just don't like her, that's all.

The kid, whoever it is, will survive.

Where we gonna sleep tonight?

Don't worry about that.

Put it here.

Gold is the best. Gold and silver.

None for me?

Maybe a little bit. Later.

Crabs and Goats...

very soon you may realize
your forgotten dreams.

And for our Twins.
it's best to lay low...

Tonight you can be the big winner
in the National Lottery...

Here's Lady Luck herself...

Miss Esperanza Natividad.

Virgo never needs to say
she's sorry.

Scorpions will enter
a period of stress...

especially if they try to rise
to a higher level.

Lions...

should never live with Fish.

Remember that the race
goes not always to the swiftest...

and that youth is the land
of the possibility.

The Road of Knowledge...

is blocked by the prejudice
of the smug.

And to follow the crowd
is to lose your way.

Aquarians...

it's time for reflection...

to learn the lessons of the past
and apply them to the future.

On the other hand. Libra...

expect a change that will
turn your life upside down.

I see irreversible events...

grave warnings
in the movement of the planets.

We must obseve their orbits
with caution.

There are forces in life
we can neither explain nor control.

Our fotune is not accidental...

but a confluence of energy.
negative or positive.

Great days are coming!

You have unlimited potential.

We must remember...

that life offers
as many oppotunities

as there are stars in the sky.

The Heavens
don't determine our destiny.

but if we listen carefully
to their signals.

we can smile at tomorrow!

Hey, look, buy this from me.

Look, I'm selling, I'm selling...

a book, please. It's about a goat.

Look, I'm selling a book.
It's really interesting, about a goat.

Sir, I'm selling a book.
Please, sir.

It's really cheap!

Eileen Mulroney.
I got here as soon as I could.

The traffic was...

Have a seat, please.

You, too?

Looks like it.
That's great.

Congratulations.
Likewise.

I left mine at the hotel.

Be my guest.

Thanks.

It was so sudden.

I had a pretty good idea.
You did?

I lit a fire under my lawyer
yesterday.

Spread some money around.
Really?

Got their attention.

Put in a good word for you, too.

Thank you.

In two minutes,
my life will never be the same.

Her name's going to be Esmeralda.

Did I tell you that?

Who knows what lies ahead for you?

Maybe a wonderful life.

Ready.

Good luck, my love.
