With Great Respect to Dan Aykroyd,

In Loving Memory of
Brandon Michael Mulvihill

and
Collin James Cole

We begin the story
on a dark and cold night...

...night...

In the middle of no where...
out in the woods...

...woods...

...in those woods, an old man was experimenting
in the dark arts...

...dark arts...

dark arts?

yeah, witchcraft and stuff

wait... I though a witch was a chick

the old man would spend years by himself experimenting
on corpses that he dug up at the local graveyard

some say...!!!

that he would begin to build an army of the
undead to take over and rule the world...

...the world...

but something went terribly wrong...

the corpses overwhelmed him
and consumed his flesh


dude... stop ruining the story

sorry

after killing their master
they would wait for years for their next victim

knock it off

after having nowhere to go
the corpses would return to the earth in which they came

they would bury themselves in the ground
in these very woods

can you hear them?

can you hear them underneath us right now?


dude, stop with the lame moan!

that wasnâ€™t me


whatcha reading Ed?

ahh it is 58.27 on the ecto wave length

what is that a class five?

no, barely a class four

Letâ€™s book this ghost da-no!

Itâ€™s â€œletâ€™s book â€™em, Danno!â€

you stupid commie
where are you from, Fakestain?

Move!

Right there fella.
For you, the war is over.

Alright kids this is the part where
you shield your eyes

Iâ€™m closing the trap in three... two... one...

How did you guys get here so fast?

We were on the neighborhood
when we picked up on this phantasm signal.

Whatâ€™s this?

Give me that.

You ainâ€™t 21 are ya?

um, ahehem... yeah dude

Yeah right.
Pavel!

nice!

Ed
looks like youâ€™re driving

shouldnâ€™t you kids be at home studying?

dude, it is Saturday

you know, you really shouldnâ€™t drink alcohol

Studies have shown that alcohol leads to a decrease
in brain function.

drugs are bad too

and... drunk driving and... abortion is...
...well I donâ€™t really have an opinion on that

who are you guys?

Weâ€™re the Ghostbusters.

RETURN OF THE
GHOSTBUSTERS

 If thereâ€™s something strange 
 in your neighborhood 

 Who ya gonna call? 

 GHOSTBUSTERS 

 If thereâ€™s something weird 
 and it donâ€™t look good 

 Who ya gonna call? 

 GHOSTBUSTERS 

 I ainâ€™t afraid of no ghosts 

Who are you going to call indeed?

the Denver Ghostbusters

those paranormal eliminators
who protect the safety of â€˜Joe Publicâ€™

Ed Spengler,
nephew of ghostbusting great Egon Spengler

team leader, scientist and television star

Pavel Karnov
trained by the best after the fall of the iron curtain

I like what I do

Neil Anderson
ladies man, and self proclaimed bad ass

excuse me, are you guys worried that youâ€™re
gonna put yourselves out of a job?

out of a job?
are you crazy man?

as long as people keep dying
there will always be ghosts

what about the activists
that are rallying around the rights of ghosts?

look

I am a real busy guy

would you like an autograph or something?

the Ghostbusters arrived in Denver three
years ago, and defeated Freddy Krueger...

How come channel 4 gets all the sensations?

these guys are a joke man

theyâ€™re better than anything you two
have turned in in the past week

our story last night was great
I mean

the firemen prevailed, the kitten was rescued
and...

shut up

it was a story of hope

April, I thought you
were better than this

channel 4 is getting all the news

I just hope the advertisers
donâ€™t find out about it and pull out

you know...
we need something good

like these Ghostbusters
are a hot item right now

Ghostbusters?

oh... ok... so...
Iâ€™m better than stories about
kittens trapped in trees

but Iâ€™m not quiet good
enough for real news

April, I know youâ€™re bitter
about the anchor position

but I need you in the field

this is embarrassing chief
I need a real story

now...

there are these Egyptian
artifacts coming into town

Fredericâ€™s team is on this

theyâ€™ve got an interview set up with
Dr. Konstantin

heâ€™s the chief archaeologist

Fredericâ€™s pieces are so flat

come on
put me on this one chief

Yeah!!!
give us a chance

I tell you what...
if you can get an appointment
with the Ghostbusters

Then Iâ€™ll give you a follow up
interview with Dr. Konstantin

Just like you let me have that
anchor position right chief

April

Letâ€™s just take it

if we get a hold of the
Ghostbusters by tomorrow then

we could have the production in post
by tomorrow afternoon

mmm... in time for
the evening news...

now that would be good
competition for channel 4

Mr. Jenks, I really donâ€™t think
that this is a good story

I donâ€™t wanna take it

you should be thanking
me for what I give you

Now just take it,
go and do your job

[computer beep] Uh Oh!

good morning sunshine

you know how Ed always compares
a human brain to a sponge

yeah yeah

with the soaking up
information and stuff

yeah

it feels like somebody used
my brain to clean a toilet

and then tried to ring it out

big night
last night?

yeah
I hit it pretty hard with a friend

Pavel?

Jack Daniels

where are the guys anyway?

Edâ€™s TV show they are
taping this afternoon

No, those punks donâ€™t get a day off
if they get a day off I get a day off

look

hold down my calls, cuz once
my ass hits that couch

Iâ€™m not getting up until dinner time

Quantum Leap reruns all day

[phone ringing]

I AM NOT HERE

Good Morning
Denver Ghostbusters

I am sorry
none of them are available

no maâ€™am
I... OK... hold on

Neil she wants to talk to you

give me the phone

hi maâ€™am
how you doing?

yeah great

look, we are pretty
booked up over here

swimming in specters and such
let me see if weâ€™ve got any openings

youâ€™re gonna regret it

itâ€™s looking like the last Wednesday of
the month is the earliest

so I think Iâ€™m gonna pass
you back off to my secretary here

You go ahead and give her your number
weâ€™ll get back to you as soon as we can.

thanks a bunch for calling

Iâ€™m sorry about that maâ€™am.
Iâ€™ll have â€™em call you back.

yeah, and your number was...
ok... and your name was...

APRIL HUNTER

APRIL HUNTER!!!
APRIL HUNTER!!!

channel 8 news April Hunter?
the hot chick?

You said you werenâ€™t interested.

the hot chick...
what she want? she want an interview?

she want me?

She wanted to meet the Ghostbusters.
I told her youâ€™ll call her back.

did you get her number?

Yes, off course I got her number.

Itâ€™s right here.

alright! alright!
call her back, tell her I can
meet her this afternoon ok?

but Ed and Pavel are
taping this afternoon

Who cares, theyâ€™ve
got their own lime light.

Itâ€™s time for me
to get a piece, alright.

Besides, donâ€™t you think Iâ€™m professional
enough to handle one little interview?

 Itâ€™s Ed Spengler. 

 Heâ€™s the science nerd. 

greetings and welcome to the show

Iâ€™m Ed Spengler, the science nerd,
and this is my esteemed colleague:

Pavel Karnov.

Now today weâ€™ll be putting the finishing
touches on the neutron accelerator.

For those of you joined us at home,
donâ€™t forget proper protection.

good point Pavel

Thatâ€™s why I recommend a level 4
radiation suit, complete with 2, not 1,

but 2 layers of lead paneling,

a heart monitor, and a gamma ray tuned
built in Geiger counter.

But since we donâ€™t have any of that
weâ€™ll use safety goggles,

and rubber gloves, which can be
purchased at your local hardware store.

This is good opportunity to support
local business, not corporate whores.

now... Pavel we need to speak
kindly about our sponsors

Once this miniature reactor is finished
weâ€™ll be able to generate

an energy field by converting
hydrogen into helium.

woo, it sounds very dangerous

it is

thatâ€™s why we have
the sub-atomic housing set

to counter the intense
gravitational field and heat

thatâ€™ll be generated by the process

for those of you following along at home
donâ€™t forget your sub-atomic house?

ok, you see here, we got
the standard proton pack

ok, we got... little knobs here to adjust
stream length

and stream intensity

I donâ€™t know what that does

uhm... yes, thatâ€™s very interesting
but could we perhaps get some footage of
you firing it for the story?

in here?

why not?
youâ€™re professional arenâ€™t you?

well...

yeah...

yeah...

damn straight I am a professional
we can do that, sure why not

alright Gallagher get this

Iâ€™m on it

you guys are gonna
wanna step back a little

there we go

a little further

yeah...ok.
are you guys ready?

oh yeah

alright letâ€™s go ahead
and switch this thing on

alright

Iâ€™ll give you guys a little show
here we go!

ok...

ok.. uhm...

hum...

ah... yeah...

see I am a professional
you see that

the ceiling is now on fire

and Iâ€™m not worried

maybe you should

yeah
absolutely

hold this

that about does it for the
fundamental particle chamber

we should now be able to
positively and negatively charge

electrons at a rate similar to
that found in small stars

like Gary Coleman or would he
be considered a small has-been?

What you talkinâ€™ â€™bout Pavel?

this here is the protection grid
for the ecto containment unit

itâ€™s been upgraded from the old system
and it is now all digital

So you keep peopleâ€™s souls
in a computer.

well.. yeah...
I gue... yeah

thatâ€™s right
actually... uhm...

let me just show you
if you...

go right here...

just... just a second
itâ€™s ok uhm...

well... well itâ€™s... uhm
itâ€™s fine it does this all the time

we should step back

coming back in 30 seconds

 [music?] 

hello

ED!!!

quick youâ€™ve gotta get back here man
the containment unit is trying to

p...p..perjurate

what?

what did you do?

I donâ€™t know I was just
clicking on somethin...

is that an alarm
I hear in the background?

maybe

yes

alright, Iâ€™ll be there in
six and a half minutes

Pavel youâ€™re gonna
have to take over

what?
what should I do?

itâ€™ll be easy, just
talk to the camera

there is only a few minutes
left to the show anyway

ok

Do not touch anything!

hey where the hell are you going?

I got to stop the containment unit
from purging

canâ€™t you just wait
there is ten minutes left to the show

in ten minutes half the city
will be vaporized

besides Iâ€™ve got Pavel
covering for me

so weâ€™ve been at this for a few years now
so thatâ€™s pretty good

the boys back in Manhattan
they get sued all the time

weâ€™ve been lucky
weâ€™ve avoided that issue

so I had this dream last night right
more like a nightmare

I was trapped in these movies
and I couldnâ€™t get out

does that ever happen?

what?

youâ€™re 30 seconds late man

I got held out coming
out of the studio

Neil, Iâ€™ve told you a million times do not mess
around with the containment unit

especially the protection grid

will you relax man?
itâ€™s for a news story

I figured we could use the publicity

Hi, Iâ€™m April Hunter
from channel 8 news.

Ed Spengler, paranormal
elimination and investigation

so...

I suppose youâ€™re curious as
how the containment unit works

actually yes I am curious

well, itâ€™s pretty basic really
we are all made up of atoms

which are basically electrical particles
vibrating and bouncing around

now the law of conservation states
that energy cannot be created or destroyed

so when a person dies, their
life energy disperses throughout the galaxy

to heaven or hell or whatever
it is you believe in

but sometimes for whatever reasons
some of that energy sticks around and

uhm, thatâ€™s what keeps us in business

harvesting souls

electrical anomalies
Miss Hunter

psychokinetic energy

and with the encoder I built
we can convert those ghosts into a signal

and from there itâ€™s a snap
to store â€™em in the computer

provided Pavel hasnâ€™t crammed
the memory full of porn

like I said

itâ€™s simply erratic residual energy
left over when a person dies

weâ€™re not talkinâ€™ Danteâ€™s
inferno here

and who are you to decide
the fate of humanityâ€™s souls?

first off, we bust
â€˜bad ghostsâ€™

and frankly, â€˜goblinsâ€™ have killed
in the past making it quiet serious

my colleague is right

our clients call us when
they have a problem

if our work wasnâ€™t satisfactory
then we wouldnâ€™t get paid

so what it really comes
down to IS your money

look, donâ€™t make me
your â€œstraw manâ€

weâ€™re scientists here

well...
Iâ€™m a scientist

Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m just trying to be
the objective reporter here

get the facts straight

well then get this straight

around here people
consider us heroes

we help people in this town
and we do damn fine work

believe we have
everything we need

thatâ€™s it

bye

hey

wait a second

wait up

I cannot wait to see the
footage on this guys

I think this is gonna
make a great story

I think it went really
well in there

well, youâ€™re in luck
hopefully itâ€™ll air tonight

very very cool

very cool

you know what, you never
thanked me to saving your life in there

he saved my life

you know if I recall correctly
it was uhm... Mr. Spengler

that turned off the containment
system before it went critical

if anything you almost
ended my life

come on

ouch!

hey wait a minute

wait wait wait wait

how about I make it up
to you over dinner?

dinner?

Shut up!!!
Shut up!!!

I gotta a 12 pack with
your name on it

Iâ€™d love to, I really would but I uhm..
I gotta another interview to do

yeah but, is he a celebrity?
I mean... come on

yeah he is
Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve heard of him

Klaus Konstantin
heâ€™s been in the news quite a lot

yeah, rings a bell

so what?
you date all your assignments?

no, just the ones
that arenâ€™t jerks

come on

weâ€™re here on location near
the ancient Egyptian city

of CinÃ©polis where
Dr. Klaus Konstantin

and his team have made a
remarkable discover

tell us about it professor

well sir, it would appear that
what we have discovered

is in fact the amulet of
Anubis

and what is...
what is that?

the amulet of Anubis is
an ancient talisman

fabled to carry the powers
of Anubis

the most ancient guardian of
the under world

according to ancient
Egyptian beliefs

sounds very... old

Ed, how many times are we
gonna watch this tape?

Iâ€™m very worried
about this story Neil

all right letâ€™s hear it

well, Iâ€™ve been researching this amulet
that Konstantin has recovered

Anubis is an incredibly ancient god,
the god of the underworld according
to ancient Egyptian myth

He was responsible of escorting souls
through the after life to their final judgment.

He was also responsible for
feeding souls of sinners to Ammit...

the eater of the dead.

so, what?
no heaven?

no anything

being fed to Ammit meant the soul would vanish
into an oblivion with no further hope of existence

so Konstantin can eat souls
with this amulet thingy

well... sort of

if he figured out how to decipher it
he can open up a gateway
to an alternate dimension

the after life or Hall of Two Truths according
to ancient Egyptian mythology

Pavel, youâ€™re just in time, Ed is
making another apocalypse prediction

and weâ€™re going to be studying the find
in my lab in Denver later this week

Professor Konstantin!

what?
you know him?

Iâ€™ll tell you what, you stay here and
day dream about Konstantin all you want.

Iâ€™m hitâ€™n the bar

you down?

you buying?

you driving?

itâ€™s a deal comrade
letâ€™s drink

letâ€™s do it

if this talisman actually carries
the powers of Anubis

Iâ€™ll be interested in
finding ways to harness â€™em

perhaps as a weapon

for the good of
mankind of course

what are you up to professor?

hereâ€™s the crate you
asked for professor

excellent

thank you

the amulet of Anubis

something Iâ€™ve been searching
for my entire professional life

where are the the rest of the
crates from the expedition?

theyâ€™re on their way
to the museum

well Iâ€™ll need some time
with this one

Iâ€™ll bring it back tomorrow

personally

alright
whatever you say sir

oh...

ahhh
sir?

I donâ€™t know if this is something
youâ€™d be interested or not

but a couple of us are gonna go
down to Chuck E. Cheese

a little later on try to pick up some MILFS

some what?

yeah, you know thereâ€™s lots of them that
hang out there for some reason

mechanical puppets or something
I donâ€™t know

but I didnâ€™t really wanna tell you,
they just asked me to ask you so...

you wanna do it or not?

some other time perhaps

I have a later engagement

wow
with a woman?

%$^&*@! of course with a woman

a nice beautiful reporter woman

is it so hard to believe
that a man...

that a man like me

can find love

no...

no!!!

I mean yeah but
itâ€™s not because your crippled

alright itâ€™s because
youâ€™re not very good looking

and...
donâ€™t take that the wrong way

you know youâ€™re not very good looking
just look in the mirror, goddamn it

quiet

Iâ€™ll see you tomorrow

alright, stay and fondle your
little amulet or whatever

have a good time without me

so Pavel, tell me what you know
about professor bubble boy

I just donâ€™t think he is a
nice fellow, thatâ€™s all

hey look, weâ€™re on
television 8

ahh... for Christâ€™s sakes
can somebody change the channel in here?

I donâ€™t wanna see her

hey, I know whatâ€™s up
youâ€™re sweet on this reporter girl arenâ€™t you?

what?
no way man! argh

no... no...

well...

sort of

yeah...

definitely

why donâ€™t you just ask her out?

what the hell do you know
about women anyway?

women just like
confidence, watch this

hello lady

I know someone who
wants to beat your ass

oh yeah?! who?

my balls

youâ€™re cute

see

you gotta be shitting me man
itâ€™s the worst line Iâ€™ve ever heard

ah geez! Are these crack pots at it again.

what was that chief?

these Ghostbuster freaks,
theyâ€™re crack pots

idiots like them give the
country a bad name

you know what I think,

I think your mouth makes
this country look bad

makes it smell bad too

hum

what do we get here?
piss?

is this your beverage of choice
at this fine establishment?

you smart mouth

hey! youâ€™re better watch
what you say to me

Stupid face!

I say whatever I want
sausage tits

no you wonâ€™t
sausage face

why donâ€™t you uh, stop...

repeating my insults and adding
the word face to â€™em, you moron?

hey, relax comrades, OK?

hey, blow it out your ass
your communist pig

hey!

whatâ€™s up?

Bring it on you butt hole!

whatâ€™s that thing
youâ€™re working on?

well... by using miniature
micro fusion reactions

it creates quantum leaps in atoms
forming super charged electron particles

this in turn causes the protons to be held together
at 10,000 times the force in a standard proton pack

sounds complicated

elementary really

itâ€™s a prototype of a
new pack Iâ€™m working on

I call it the neutrino pack

[phone ringing]

Ghostbusters

hi Annie, itâ€™s Neil

ITâ€™S NEIL

Hello

hey Ed

can you come
pick me and Pavel up?

what? you guys
canâ€™t walk home?

not without posting bail

alright, I guess Iâ€™ll have to
TiVO American Idol

that interview...
that was a lot of fun

that was a lot of presence

thank you very much

I had a wonderful time
tonight April

thatâ€™s great

well... uhm...
this is my place

April itâ€™s lovely

April

darling

youâ€™ve been addressing
me as mister all night

Please call me Klaus

Mr. Konstantin

KLAUS: What is it?

I like you a lot
I enjoy your company greatly

I just had to do an interview
and thatâ€™s all that I really...

Just one moment please

hello

good evening Mr. Konstantin

can this not wait until morning?

the rest of the board wanted
me to call as soon as possible

what information does
the Congrie have to send?

theyâ€™re pulling funding
for you project Klaus

What!!! You canâ€™t do this

Iâ€™ve only begun deciphering the...

the board feels the company has already
lost enough money on this project

theyâ€™re not seeing the
results you promised

I said the damned amulet
would take time to decipher

youâ€™re not being fair

we have a dead line to meet
weâ€™re going to go with another project

you back stabbers!

we had a deal

Lab Rat Enterprises produces weapons
for military use, Mr. Konstantin

youâ€™re talking about some sort of â€˜god stoneâ€™
that consumes the souls of the living

yes!...

and what greater weapon is there!?

an offer is on the table
that we canâ€™t refuse

goodbye

sons of bitches

you said the amulet was for
educational purposes

you said that it was for
the good of mankind

it shows what
the hell you know

There isnâ€™t enough money in education to pay
for a Greyhound ticket to Wichita.

youâ€™re two face jerk

listen here you little tootsie roll

Iâ€™m a scientist,
we donâ€™t work for free

live with it

you are just trying to
make a quick buck

and itâ€™s disgusting,
you are disgusting

and what do you know? hum?
what do you know?

youâ€™re just a media whore probably
sleeping youâ€™re way to the top

and the only reason youâ€™ve got this job
is because youâ€™re so young and pretty

argh!

how dare you strike me,
Iâ€™m a powerful scholar!

Iâ€™ll have you, Iâ€™m a powerf... arhh
sweet harvesty!

Jesus!
ED

you look like hell

late night

so... did the ratings come in?

yeahhh

thatâ€™s what I wanna
talk to you about

did we get the new time slot?

look Ed, donâ€™t get me wrong,
I like you, we all like you

we think you do a good show,
but itâ€™s just...

you donâ€™t really connect with
our younger audience

this is a science show

kids arenâ€™t gonna be interested in this unless
it has some overrated actor playing
pranks on other celebrities

or pimping someoneâ€™s ride

this is an educational show, doesnâ€™t the
government pay for part of this?

yeah...

but...

we also lost three advertisers last week

so youâ€™re canceling the show

no no no no no

definitely not

so whatâ€™s the problem then
do you want me to be funnier?

weâ€™re replacing you

what?

we need someone who can
connect with the kids,
someone cooler

someone street smart

someone...

jive!

like who?

Iâ€™m not interrupting anything,
am I Robert?

Levar, come on in
I like you to meet Ed Spengler

oh... alright, nice to meet you,
I heard so much about you

youâ€™re a Ghostbuster,

how are things?

uhm... couldnâ€™t be better

sorry I have to meet you like this
but... hey... Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll get by

youâ€™re soul harvesting
business is doing good

what is it with that term?

what else are you
supposed to call it?

the same thing weâ€™ve always called it,
busting ghosts

now look Rob, Iâ€™ve been hosting
this show for six months

Iâ€™ve got two PhDs,
heâ€™s not qualified

actually I have a PhD and Iâ€™m
working on my second

come on heâ€™s like fifteen

actually heâ€™s the youngest ever to
receive a PhD from Cornell

heâ€™s like the black Doogie Howser

thank you, and Iâ€™ve written a
New York Times best seller

give me a break, anybody whoâ€™s
been published is on that list

Dr. Phil is on that list
for a diet book.

a diet book!

well... letâ€™s just say heâ€™s
not exactly in shape himself

I know this is tough to grasp
look Ed, Like I said, we like you

weâ€™ll keep you in mind
for other shows

hey, and why donâ€™t you use your â€˜talentsâ€™ to
benefit mankind instead of enslaving its afterlife?

maybe Iâ€™ll save a soul for you

seems like you could use one

ser setam shamzoozoo nerhuntai
umpatcha

nah furie shahm shahvin

Ammit sudin je Klaus Konstantin

miri hi ni pertet

I request the power and accept the burden

Anubis, god of the two halls

I request the power and accept the burden

damn it

whatâ€™s wrong here?
I did everything

I deciphered the language

of course

I need to power the amulet

and the only way to do that
is with a celestial sacrifice

of course

a human soul

not something I can pick
up at the super market

or Seven Eleven

and how long can I contain
it for as long as I need it

...trap the ghosts then we can store â€™em in this
containment facility as long as necessary

actually, indefinitely if need be

Ghostbusters

there, now thatâ€™s news

April your ratings are up

hardly, I mean that story was nothing

all we had to do was point the camera and
that idiot blabbermouth did the rest

they were cool though

yeah... so whatâ€™s next chief?
something a little bit more exciting?

next? this is a gold mine,
people canâ€™t get enough of this stuff

I want you to go back to these folks

back?

hell yes

this is a gold mine

I wanna week long exposÃ©

I want to show the city what is like
to be a Ghostbuster for a week

no! no no no no

you sent Frederic to Egypt you made Adam anchor
what do they have that I donâ€™t?

April, youâ€™ll get your chance yet

now just do your job,
go out there, dig up some dirt

so this is all about
making them look bad?

no, itâ€™s about business

this isnâ€™t right

Itâ€™s not about right or wrong itâ€™s...
I just donâ€™t like the idea of making them look bad

hell...

April, Iâ€™m trying to do you a favor, this is good stuff,
I want you to be out there I want you to...

ok April, if you do this for me, Iâ€™ll make
you anchor by the end of the month

anchor... wow...
I just...

now go, go do your job ok?

and show some enthusiasm, will you?

oh, Iâ€™m enthused

greetings

oh...hello!
may I help you?

yes, Iâ€™m here to see the Ghostbusters

ok... well theyâ€™re on a case right now
would you like to make an appointment?

yes, whatâ€™d you have at the earliest?

theyâ€™re pretty busy

it looks like

the first available would be next Thursday

ssssssssssleeeeep

itâ€™s beautiful

he hey! buddy!

do you have any change buddy?

change?

yeah! you know nickels, dimes, quarters...
you know, anything like that would be great

oh god! youâ€™re repulsive

Iâ€™m not picky so...

why you ask a man in crippled,
a cripple man for change!?

why donâ€™t we see what this thing is?

I have seen one of those,
is there money in there?

you should be the first to find out

disgusting man

I have your pathetic soul

my first one

hahahaha


with this offering, I accept the gift and the
burden of some of your great power

hahahaha...

Ha Hahahaha!...

hoh, oh Hahahahaha!

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha...

wo, wo, wo, whoa

let me try the new pack this time

I donâ€™t think so I still to test a bit

come on man, why do
you getta have all the fun?

look, Iâ€™m taking a big enough risk by bringing it
here already with all the press coverage weâ€™ve been getting

thatâ€™s such a BS
you know what?

just let me try the new pack,
I mean whatâ€™s the worst that could happen?

look, this is not a piece of equipment to toy with
if it goes critical it could detonate a 60 gigaton explosion

or worse

collapse on to its self creating matter so
dense that it becomes a black hole

why is it that every time we get a new piece
of equipment, you dive into the science talk?

all I wanna do is try out the new pack
and I donâ€™t see what the big deal is

come on Ed, just let him try it

even Pavel!, come on man

alright, alright
I just want you to take it seriously

I take everything seriously, you know that

serious is my middle name

thank god you guys are here

how many are there?

uhm, more than one for sure... uhm
this isnâ€™t too much trouble, is it?

only for your bank account pal

Iâ€™m sorry, there is a â€œno smokingâ€ in here

thanks

my P.K.E. integrated cellphone
seems to be malfunctioning

whatâ€™s the matter?
you ran out of minutes there, jack ass?

It definitely is a strong signal

Pavel!
use your ecto motion tracker

right

Iâ€™ve got something here

multiple signals, front and behind

what? where man?
I donâ€™t see anything

look sharp people

theyâ€™re closing

there

good evening

please forgive me for my intrusion
I promise to be brief

yes

damn it, you go that way, Iâ€™ll go this way

you could just told me, gee

Neil, you wait here

hello, channel 8?

you might wanna send someone down
to the Mayan Theater

quickly

the Ghostbusters are
attacking the staff

noooo, the Ghostbusters

no the Ghostbusters,
theyâ€™re attacking t...

Ghostbusters

theyâ€™re taking their
god damned souls

Ed, we might have something here

what is it?

a whole bunch of ectoplasm

yeah, Iâ€™ve got some in here as well

yeah, thereâ€™s a lot here

on the ceiling

well, whatâ€™s a lot?
weâ€™ve seen loads of this stuff before

itâ€™s... bubbling?

is that a question or an observation?

goddamn Iâ€™m good

Neil,
quick turn down the electron flow

where?

You IDIOT!

what happened?

You just completely destroyed a SOUL!

destroyed?- I told you to turn it DOWN!

I donâ€™t know how to work
this goddamned thing

Can you comprehend the implications
of what you just did?

You just completely obliterated a soul!

well, it was bad right?

ED!

Ed come on!

an unknown source has claimed that
the Ghostbusters are responsible for putting
the employees of this theater into comas

however...

comas?

one of our packs malfunctioned
and destroyed a ghost

so the Ghostbusters are
now murdering spirits

wait a second, that was an accident

April, what the hell are you doing?

Iâ€™m doing my job, just like you

Do you know anything about these comas?

look, I donâ€™t know what the hell went on out here.

That was the scene downtown tonight
when the Ghostbusters started attacking innocent people.

Uh, the new pack wasnâ€™t thoroughly tested, and it
somehow malfunctioned, and a soul was destroyed.

It was my fault really. I just
should have tested it more thoroughly.

Ed Spengler, leader of the Denver Ghostbusters,
also built the machine that destroyed the ghost.

Ed and team have been under scrutiny,
questioning the ethics behind what they do.

And tonightâ€™s instant has caught the
attention of the federal government,

Who will reportedly seek to pass legislation on
â€œghostbustingâ€, as well as dealings with the afterlife.

Get that [beep] camera out of my face!

A cease and desist has already been
ordered on the Denver Ghostbusters.

As more coma victims continue
to pile up across the city.

April

Whatâ€™s the deal wh..Why are
you trying to make us look bad.

Itâ€™s nothing personnel Neil, itâ€™s just the news.

Yeah, itâ€™s just bad news.

Yeah well, bad news is the only type of news that sells OK.

People donâ€™t like hearing about happy stories

They like hearing about stories that make their
miserable little lives seem a little bit better.

What really happened in there Neil?

I donâ€™t know. We came down here. It was a routine bust.
come outside, and this

Everybody thinks weâ€™re...

bad.

I donâ€™t think that youâ€™re that bad.

Then why do the story?

I donâ€™t... I donâ€™t kn... my boss, he just
thinks that this will help my career and I jus...

Alright... alright.

Why donâ€™t we just...

Why donâ€™t we talk about it over...

dinner.

What do we want?...
GHOST RIGHTS!!

When do we want it?...
NOW!!

What do we want?...
GHOST RIGHTS!!

When do we want it?...
NOW!!



Hey!

You awake?

Oh... uh, I mustâ€™ve dosed off.

You better go home and get some sleep.

Yeah.

Hey!... where are you going?

Ahh.. Can it MacGyver! I donâ€™t
need anymore of your crap.

Iâ€™m taking April to dinner.

Oh, oh, hurts dunnâ€™t!

Ohhh!



What, no Jaguar?

Itâ€™s in the shop.

Oh, OK, thanks.


Sparks in the air tonight.

Dropping off or picking up?

Um, neither...

Uh, good evening maâ€™am, this is uh, Agent J.

Iâ€™m Agent K. Weâ€™d like to ask you a few questions.

We found this man behind your establishment.

Did anybody see or hear anything this evening?

No, I was playing video games all night, and earlier
I was watching â€˜Batman and Robinâ€™, and then before...

Iâ€™m not looking for an alibi tonight maâ€™am.
Iâ€™m just lookâ€™n to ask ya a few questions.

Wait, â€˜Batman and Robinâ€™? The television
show or the crappy George Clooney movie?

I didnâ€™t think it was that bad!

Oh please... all the cool, icy, chill, freeze, analogies.

My god, the bat suit had nipples on it!

Ok... First of all, we need to get this man to a hospital.

Second!...

Any movie with Uma Thurman
in it is ok in my book man.

Weâ€™re gonna need an ambulance at 7345
South Seventeenth Street. I got a 10-20...

I got a 10-Fif...

Whatâ€™s the code for comatose?

I got a coma guy!

This is very strange.

Iâ€™m getting a zero-point-zero reading on the P.K.E. Meter

What does that mean?

The P.K.E. Meter detects even the
slightest amount of psycho kinetic energy.

Every living soul on the planet
emits at least some signal.

This man...

He has no soul.

What is he, a politician?

No, it appears that someone or
some...thing has stolen this manâ€™s soul.

Iâ€™d like to get him inside, I could do a few tests.

No can do doc, we got the
ambulance on the way right now.

This guy appears to be in the same condition
that the other were at the Mayan Theatre.

Are they alright? I havenâ€™t heard anything.

Theyâ€™re all down at St. Maryâ€™s

Theyâ€™re still alive but...
Sleepâ€™n it off like this guy.

Iâ€™m afraid this doesnâ€™t look to good for your company sir.

I swear, I had nothing to do with this.

If I can get him inside, I could run a
few tests and I can figure all of this out

Murderers!

Messâ€™n with ghosts isnâ€™t good enough,
now you have to mess with the living.

Wait right here.

So, should we take the body inside?

Yep.

Hey well, I had a great time tonight.

I did too. We should get together and do it again sometime.

Definitely, only I pick the place next time. Ok?

What, no fish tacos?
No, no fish tacos! [Laughing]

Those were good!

Yeah, Iâ€™m thinking something a little
bit more authentic. Italian maybe... candles?

Yeah, we can do that.

But hey, Iâ€™m tired, Iâ€™m gonna get to bed.

Yeah I...

I got stuff to do too, so.

Ok

night
good night

Oh, hey, drive careful

Hey, itâ€™s me!

Yeah, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m talking about.

Bye

Hey I saw that you pussy.
Too lame to go in for the kiss?

I..Iâ€™m not lame!

Yeah, whatever. Bet you havenâ€™t been laid in years.

NEIL: kiss my sack!

You donâ€™t wait long to get back on the wagon, do you?

How the hell did you get in here?

The window was open.

Iâ€™m calling the cops.

Iâ€™ve decided to give you one last chance...

To join me!

Your legs...

Lying about secret weapon contracts is one thing...

Pretending to be in a wheelchair is just desp...

I am offering you one last chance to be my QUEEN!

Forget it! Get out of here, you freak!

Alright...

But first thereâ€™s something Iâ€™d like to show you.

How the hell did you get that!

Iâ€™m calling the police.

They cannot help you.

No!...No!... NO!...NO!

Hey, whatâ€™s going on in here?

Miss Hunter, you ok?

Iâ€™m fine! He was just leaving!

Good day

Sorry for interrupting, it sounded
like something was going on in here.

No, everythingâ€™s fine now thank you.

Can you please make sure that that gentleman
finds his way out of the building completely.

Will do.

Hey! You!

Sir, Iâ€™m gonna hafta ask you to leave the building.

I donâ€™t know what the problem is!?
I was just trying to show her something.

I donâ€™t think sheâ€™ll wanna see anything youâ€™ve gotta show her.

Well then perhaps, youâ€™d like to see.

Hey, good morning boys.

April! What are doing here?

Good morning lady. Iâ€™m making blintza

Yeah, you wanna stay for breakfast?

Sure.

And this morning my superintendent
was unconscious in the hallway.

Itâ€™s strange, Konstantin is walking now too.

So, your saying that Konstantin has one of our traps?

Thatâ€™s what it looked like, yes.

If Konstantin has one of our traps he
may be able to figure out how to use...

Wait wait wait. Ya know, I heard that if you look into
that thing while itâ€™s closing it can make you impotent.

What, like you canâ€™t go when you need to?

Thatâ€™s incontinence.

I think you get that too.

Is that true?
Ask Ed.

Ed, are you impotent?

Dr. Stantzâ€™s theory is that the
eyes are a window into the soul.

Therefore if a living person were to
look into the trap, as it was closing,...

It could steal their life
essence, rendering that person...

What! A flesh craving zombie Ed?

In a comatose state.

Pavel?

What!?

Do you think that Konstantin would ever
intentionally steal a personâ€™s soul?

Wait a minute, why the hell would he know?

I think he would do anything to unlock his amulet.

I knew it!

I knew you knew more than than
you wanted me to know you knew.

What do you know?

Pavel is a former student of Konstantinâ€™s

What the hell is going on here Pavel?

Are you working for him?

So what, Ed gets to know about your past,
and you keep it a secret from me?

I didnâ€™t think it was big deal.

Big deal!? This guyâ€™s stealing
souls, for Christâ€™s sake.

And as far as Iâ€™m concerned, youâ€™re an accomplice.

And you! You son of a bitch,
you coulda clued me in on this.

Please, calm down.
No! This is bullshit!

I take enough of Edâ€™s crap,
i donâ€™t need it from you too.

Neil, there are more important things
going on here than you and your ego.

Ego!...
you think I have an ego.

Why donâ€™t we ask her,
do I have an ego?

Well...a...itâ€™s...just

Oh thatâ€™s just great! I guess Iâ€™ll
take me and my ego and get outa here.

You can help them stop Konstantin.

Great... Iâ€™ve ruined everything. Ed, Iâ€™m sorry.

No itâ€™s not you fault.

Along with the city revoking our business,
now, Iâ€™ve driven Neil away.

Did the bureaucrats take all of your equipment?

Well, we still have the neutrino pack and a couple of traps...

And Iâ€™m very thankful that for now they
havenâ€™t touched the containment unit.

Face it Ed, Ghostbusters are finished.

[Earthshaking Boom]


Oh my...

Whatâ€™s happening? He mustâ€™ve opened a portal.

Oh! Youâ€™re big! Youâ€™re big! Yeah, alright!
Destroy me! Yeah, yeah, destroy me.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, give it!


So let me get this straight.

Some madman, with the powers of
the underworld has summoned...

Some thing!

Thatâ€™s gonna devour every soul on the planet.

Ammit, the eater of the dead, your honor.

The powers of Anubis.

Forget it! I donâ€™t care!

But this... this is not gonna happen in Denver.

This doesnâ€™t really happen anywhere, mayor.

And soon it could be everywhere.

Like Starbucks.

Can you stop it?

Possibly

First we need to evacuate this area of the city.

The psycho kinetic readings for these coordinates are
off the charts. If we could isolate the threat here...

Done, what else do you need.

Well if itâ€™s not too much trouble weâ€™d like our uh...
equipment back.

Hello.

Hi.

Why are you sitting there like that?

Look kid, if itâ€™s all the same to you, Iâ€™d really
just prefer not to be bothered right now. Ok?

MOM: Allison come on, weâ€™re leaving!

Sounds like your momâ€™s calling you anyway, you donâ€™t wanna get in trouble.

Whatâ€™s wrong?

I...

I had a fight with some friends, is all.

My father says that fighting builds character.

My parents have a lot of character.

Teh

Maybe they should quit.

MOM: Allison!

Well, I havta go. Weâ€™re leaving the city.

Leaving the city? Why?

Havnâ€™t you been paying attention?

Arenâ€™t you a Ghostbuster?

Are you going to save us?


You know weâ€™re going too, right?

Itâ€™s much too dangerous.

Well, if you fail the worldâ€™s going to end anyway.

Sheâ€™s got a point.
Alright, letâ€™s rock this kasbah

Uh, sir.

Camera 17 is sending us a feed.

Itâ€™s April

Whatâ€™s she got?

Broadcast that! Interrupt all feeds.
Get New York and L.A. On the lines.

Some sort of ghost tornado, erupting from
downtown Denver, a â€œsoul-nadoâ€ if you will.

Denver at this point has been evacuated,
the mayor has sent out another warning...

What!

Denver could be facing Armageddon first hand.

It would seem that the Denver Ghostbusters are the
worldâ€™s only hope at this point as the â€œsoul-nadoâ€...

Nafu shem seti Ammit

Aiki rockto nayga

Ammit shahmsay

Nafu shem seti Ammit

I thought you guys were out of business.

Weâ€™re here by order of the mayor.

The system is so screwed up these days.

Isnâ€™t sort of of clichÃ© that every time that
thereâ€™s a â€œdisasterâ€ you get to meet the mayor?

Klause, you must stop this! This is
madness! You donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing!

I am a god! And I know exactly what Iâ€™m doing.

Ask Pavel.

Cleansing the earth of evil huh?
Precisely!

You were a better man before, this power has corrupted you.

A better man?
A CRIPPLE IN A WHEELCHAIR!

I was never a better man! No!

Being a man is nothing compared to being a god.

And I plan to release this planet from the wickedness of man.

Not everyone is WICKED!

Well, you canâ€™t make an omelet without
breaking a few eggs now can you.

These arenâ€™t eggs weâ€™re talking about.
These are peopleâ€™s souls!

Iâ€™ll do what it takes to stop you.

Show me your best Ghostbuster.

HAHAHaHahahahahaHA!

Is that all youâ€™ve got?

Here, let me try.

Ammit nechfnissy city Ammit
Meri ey!

Nufair shadam cham sity..

Meri ey!

ha ha ha ha ha ha

They are still in the building and there...

Thereâ€™s a... giant... ghost... dragon thing
flying over Denver!

GHOST DRAGON THING!

Holy SHIT!

...giant monster that looks like the ghost of...
FALKOR is terrorizing downtown Den...


Ed, You take care of that,
Iâ€™ll stay here.

Pavel...

Ed, I couldâ€™ve taken care of this a long time ago.

This time, heâ€™s not gonna get away.

Be careful!

You too.

Lavar?

What are you doing here?

Iâ€™m here to put a stop to all this nonsense.

Oh good, we could really use your help right now.

n... Iâ€™m here to stop you.
What you do is wrong.

Iâ€™m placing you under citizens arrest.

Levar, weâ€™re trying to save the world here,
canâ€™t we set aside our differences?

OK, setting aside all of our differences...

WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!

Iâ€™ve never seen a ghost that big before.

But you can stop it though, canâ€™t you?

I... thought you didnâ€™t want us
meddling in the affairs of the afterlife.

I.. t-take it back.

Iâ€™m glad youâ€™ve come to your senses Pavel.
I could use you.

As we destroy the world, Iâ€™ll need an assistant.

I donâ€™t think so.

Youâ€™ll be worshiped as a god.
money, power, it will all be yours!

What good is money and power when
you have no one to share it with.

Well I donâ€™t plan to destroy â€œeveryâ€ human.

But, those that except me as their god,
will be spared.

Join me Pavel.

The proton cannon seems to have no effect on the beast.

Can you go any faster?

Hell yeah!

This is a big ass dragon.

What it is that thing?

I have an idea.

What?

AN IDEA!

No I heard you.
Whatâ€™s your idea?

Well weâ€™ll... Weâ€™ll herd it.
Like... like cattle.

What will it be Pavel?

You already know my answer.

Your death shall be swift.

ahnas san seda...

[indistinct chanting]


WHOOOAA!

TV: ...in pursuit.

Ye Haw!

Oooh!

Well that does it for stupid snake...

Face!

You came, You saw,...

You kicked itâ€™s Aaasssss!

NICE!

YES! Nice going guys!

Ed!

I failed!

I couldnâ€™t stop him.

Letâ€™s try this.

Alright, closing trap.

What!

No, this canâ€™t be!?

NO! Those souls are MINE!

MINE!!!


Ha! Itâ€™s too late!

The portal cannot be stopped!

[Roaring!]

Blastage!

Now Lavar!

Here goes nothing.

Go full stream

Itâ€™s hopeless!


Bad dog!
No Biscuit


Donâ€™t let him get into the portal!

Thereâ€™s enough energy in that
alternate dimension to fuel his amulet.

If he gains enough power,
heâ€™ll be able to keep it open permanently.

eh no. This never ends, so what do we do?

Ed!

Let me think a second!

Ed, thereâ€™s something wrong with this thing!

Oh No! The packâ€™s gone critical, itâ€™s overloading!

What the hell does that mean?

The sub-atomic housing is overheated. The matter
is beginning to collapse into the antimatter.

Thatâ€™s BAD, right?!

For THIS dimension.

yes

Yes!

YES!!

Unlimited Power!

Unlimited Power!


YES!

Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters!

Dy-no-mite!

oh... Oh, this better be on YouTube tomorrow!

It looks like the world will keep itâ€™s souls after all.

atta girl!
Oh sheâ€™s goood!

I knew youâ€™d be back Neil.

well...

I guess I couldnâ€™t let you steal my limelight, could I!

ahh..

Oh! God! yeah

Hug, precisely what I was thinking.
alright

Hell no!

no

Good work Lavar!

Thanks, Ed. You know, I was wrong about you.

Pavel, Iâ€™m really glad youâ€™re one of the good guys.

Hey man! What do you think happened to Konstantin?

Well...

Heâ€™s Toast!

There is still no sign of the Ghostbusters
who hours ago entered the strange building.

and we have still not...
Here they come now.

What was it like in there?

Well I gotta tell ya...
that... was a close one!

uh, The threat has been eliminated. all we havta
do is return these souls to their rightful owners.

Iâ€™m gonna do a special on my show of
how Lavar Gorden almost died... twice.

I think I will go to Disneyland.
Hi Mother.

Were there any human casualties?

uh, the cripple.

Nobody cares about him.

Ya know, Whatâ€™s important is that we get
these souls back to their rightful owners.

and Ed here, is gonna describe the
device thatâ€™s gonna do, just that.

oh um...

yeah I created a device that uh captures psycho
kinetic energy and polarizes it so that uh...

you can use the electromagnetic
aura that is a residual, um, result tu...

can you edit this out later?

Ed, weâ€™re live.

uh um, as I was saying psycho kinet...

What are your feelings now that youâ€™ve come out OK?

You know what, thatâ€™s... thatâ€™s...
thatâ€™s enough OK.

Thereâ€™s no feelings...
and thereâ€™s no more pictures.

Weâ€™re going home, weâ€™re tired.
Guys weâ€™re outa here.

I will call you...
maybe...

Thought we were getting to be their friends.

And the day is once again
saved by the Ghostbusters.

Iâ€™m April Hunter from Channel 8 News, reminding you...

Donâ€™t be afraid of no ghosts!

Clean up crews will be working around the clock,
cleaning up the rubble from last nightâ€™s epic battle.

Turns out that the Ghostbusters
were ALWAYS on our side...

as I pointed out months ago...
or weeks...

Depending on what type of calendar you use.

Welcome back to â€œScience of the Universeâ€.
Iâ€™m Ed Spengler.

And Iâ€™m Lavar Gordon.

Now today is our Ghostbusters Special.

Thatâ€™s right! weâ€™re going to be taking a
look at the technology that saved the world.

 Ghostbusters!
