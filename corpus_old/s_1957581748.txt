WHERE'VE

PA! COLLEGE IS

I'M NO PREACHER,

SO WHY GO?

VERY WELL...
WHAT IS THIS "JOB?"

BASEBALL -

YOUR FATHER KNOWS A THING OR TWO
ABOUT BASEBALL ON MILL HILL.

I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT
BOOTLEG WHISKEY

ELSE AROUND YOU IS DOING IT.

NOT IF YOU
KNOW BETTER.

I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ANY MORE.

PA, WE'RE NOT
DONE TALKING!

WHAT MORE
IS THERE TO SAY?

YOUR PARENTS ARE OPPOSED TO YOU
PLAYING BASEBALL AT A MILL.

PA, DON'T YOU

I WANT THIS MORE THAN
ANYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED.

LIFE IS NOT ABOUT

I GOTTA DO THIS!

THIS IS MY
FINAL WORD.

FINE...

FROM SHOELESS JOE JACKSON
ALL THE WAY DOWN.

AND THEY ALL HAVE
ONE LITTLE SECRET.

I SUPPOSE YOU'RE
GONNA TELL ME.

IT'S ALL ABOUT
A LEVEL SWING.

RIGHT NOW YOU'RE SWINGIN'
UP AT THE BALL.

YOU'VE GOTTA LEVEL OUT SO
WHEN YOU STRIKE THE BALL

IT'S LIKE A HAMMER
HITTIN' A NAIL.

AND THIS IS
THE HAMMER.

MADE IT MYSELF.

IT'S THE BEST BATTING
COACH I'VE SEEN.

C'MON.

TAKES A LITTLE BIT
OF PRACTICE BUT...

[WACK!]

IT'LL FLATTEN OUT
YOUR SWING.

AND THE WEIGHT'LL
INCREASE YOUR BAT SPEED.

I NEED SOMETHIN'.

GIVE
IT A TRY.

[WACK!]

LIKE I SAID, TAKES
A LITTLE BIT A' PRACTICE.

I CAN SEE.

YOU GOT ANY GOOD IDEAS
FOR READING A CURVE BALL?

NEVER SWING AT A PITCH
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN.

WATCH HIS RELEASE UNTIL
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S THROWIN'

AS HE LETS IT GO.

AND JIST GOTTA HANG BACK AND
WAIT 'TIL IT DROPS INTO ZONE.

EASY TO SAY,
NOT QUITE SO EASY TO DO.

YOU GOT AN ANSWER
FOR EVERYTHING.

BEEN AROUND A WHILE.

KEEP THE HAMMER
AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

HERE'S YOUR
BUCKET OF NAILS.

[WACK!]


[WACK!]

[WACK!]

[CHURCH BELL RINGING]

[CHURCH BELL RINGING]

I WON'T BE HERE FOR LONG

OF THE CHARLOTTE
SPINNERS SCOUT.

SAY, HOW DO YOU PLAY AND
TALK AT THE SAME TIME?

WELL, YOU GET USED TO IT
AFTER A WHILE.

SOMEONE'S ALWAYS TALKING
IN THIS EAR

WHILE I'M TRYING
TO LISTEN WITH THE OTHER

WHEN I PLAY THE PIANO
FOR THE MILL CHURCH.

HAVE YOU BEEN?

NO, NOT YET.

I'M SURE I WILL.

WHY DON'T YOU PLAY
SOMETHING FOR ME.

NO, NO, LIKE I SAID
IT'S BEEN YEARS.

NOW I CAN TELL YOU
HAVE NICE HANDS -

FOR PLAYIN' THE PIANO
AND FOR PLAYIN' BASEBALL.

NO, IT WOULD NOT
BE A GOOD IDEA.

DO YOU LIKE

NOT MUCH.

BUT DADDY WILL

MAY BE DRIFTING FOUL.

FRAZIER'S TRYING TO CHASE
IT DOWN FOR THE OUT.

AND FRAZIER HAS IT.

TWO OUTS.

NEWTON'S DOWN
TO THEIR LAST OUT.

LOOKS LIKE PIKE SPANGLER IS
A RUN-OF-THE-MILL HITTER TODAY.

NEWTON NOW LOOKS FOR RELIEF

FROM THEIR ROOKIE
RIGHT FIELDER,

WILL WRIGHT.

WILL HAILS FROM THE
UP-TOWN SIDE OF NEWTON,

AND THIS IS HIS FIRST
YEAR OF ORGANIZED BALL.

WRIGHT MAY BE NEWTON'S
LAST CHANCE FOR A WIN.

NOW HE'S AT THE PLATE...

THERE'S THE WINDUP
AND THE PITCH.

STRIKE.

IT'S A STRIKE.

THAT WAS A SWEET ONE BUT
THE NEWCOMER PASSED IT UP.

0 AND 1 THE COUNT.

NEXT PITCH IS A BREAKING BALL:
HIGH AND OUTSIDE.

ONE AND ONE
THE COUNT.

STRIKE.

WRIGHT SCANS
THE STANDS.

MAYBE HE'S LOOKING
FOR INSPIRATION.

ONE AND TWO
THE COUNT.

THERE'S THE PITCH-

[WACK!]

IT'S A LONG LINE DRIVE
WAY OUT TO CENTER FIELD.

THE CENTER FIELDER'S
BACK TO THE TREES.

IT'S GONE!


A LONG HOME RUN
FOR WILL WRIGHT.

NEWTON TAKES THE LEAD,
TWO TO ONE,

AND WILL WRIGHT HAS TIPPED
THE SCALES FOR HIS TEAM.

WHAT A GAME FOR
IRON WILL WRIGHT,

THE NEXT BIG STICK
AT NEWTON.

THERE'S THE WINDUP
AND THE PITCH,

AND THAT'S
STRIKE THREE.

THAT'S THE LAST
OUT FOR NEWTON.

WE GO TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE NINTH.

WITH NEWTON AHEAD ON
WRIGHT'S LONG HOME RUN.

NOW IT'S UP TO YOUNG
CHICK SPANGLER

TO SEE IF HE CAN HOLD THE LEAD
FOR THREE MORE OUTS.


HE'S OUT!

THAT'S ONE DOWN,

THAT LONG HOME RUN IS LOOKING
BETTER AND BETTER FOR NEWTON.

STRIKE THREE.

AND THAT'S TWO DOWN.

ANDERSON'S DOWN
TO THEIR LAST OUT.


BALL.


[WACK!]

IT'S A LONG FLY BALL,
ITS WAY OUT TO CENTER FIELD.

THIS ONE'S DEEP.

WRIGHT'S GOING BACK, BACK, HE'S
AT THE TREES, AND HE'S GOT IT.

NEWTON WINS, NEWTON WINS,
NEWTON WINS!

[TRUCK ENGINE]

C'MON, WILL,
SHE AIN'T HERE.

AN' I FER ONE DON'T WANT TO BE
HERE WHEN TH' SUN GOES DOWN.

HEY.

[WACK!]

DON'T STAND THERE WITH THAT
STRAW IN YER MOUTH. C'MON.

MIGHTY SORE LOSERS.

GINNIE'S HERE
IN THE TRUCK.

OH-YOU'RE
GINNIE'S FATHER?

THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M GINNIE'S FATHER.

LOOKS LIKE YOUR
SWING'S LEVELING OUT.

YOU'RE SWING
AIN'T BAD EITHER.

WHERE D'YA

WELL, I MADE IT.

IT'S A HOBBY OF MINE-
MAKIN' BATS.

GOOD THING

GREAT GAME,

THANK YOU!

AND YOU PITCHED

THANKS.

ALRIGHT, LET'S GET

I THINK I'LL HAVE
A DOPE AND A LIME.

LET'S ALL
HAVE ONE.

FINE.

A WHAT?

IT'S NOT AS BAD
AS IT SOUNDS.

JUST COCA-COLA
WITH A SQUIRT OF LIME.

DADDY'S FAVORITE.

SHOELESS JOE SPECIAL!

THAT'S RIGHT.

NOW, THERE'S A MAN WHO COULD
TEAR THE COVER OFF A BALL.

WAIT, YOU SAW
HIM PLAY?

STILL SEE HIM ONCE IN A WHILE
'ROUND THE GREENVILLE AREA.

EVEN AFTER THAT
BLACK SOX TRIAL.

HE'LL ALWAYS BE A HERO
TO THE MILL.

YOU KNOW THAT WHOLE SERIES
HIS BATTING AVERAGE WAS .375.

AND HE SET A WORLD SERIES
RECORD WITH 12 HITS!

AND THEY BANNED HIM
ALONG WITH THE TAKERS!

ONE OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS
THAT EVER STRODE THE DIAMOND.

HE WAS A NATURAL.

SPEAKING OF FAMOUS
BALL PLAYERS,

DID YOU BOYS HEAR
THAT BILLY SUNDAY'S

GONNA BE HOLDING A MEETIN' IN
THE COUNTY SEAT THIS MONTH?

BILLY SUNDAY?

I HEARD ABOUT HIM
MY WHOLE LIFE!

I'LL BE GLAD TO TAKE ANYONE
WHO CARES TO GO.

COUNT ME IN.

SURE.
SOUNDS INTERESTING.

HERE WE ARE.

THANK YOU!

THANK YOU,
SIR.

I HOPE YOU
ENJOY THAT.

AIN'T NOBODY GONNA.
HE'S OUR BEST HITTER.

SUIT YOURSELVES.

YOU JUST MIGHT WISH YOU
HADN'T LEFT IT UP TO ME.

ALRIGHT, WILL,
COME HERE.

GRAB A HOLD OF THAT
AND TELL ME WHATCHA THINK.

MAYBE A BIT THICKER
THAN I'M USED TO.

ALRIGHT...
LET ME SEE.

I THINK I KNOW

MORE LEMONADE?

YES,
THANK YOU.

IT'S A LOT LIKE
MY MOM'S.

GINNIE, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR MOM?

WELL, IT'S NOT
A LONG STORY.

SHE DIED
WHEN I WAS BORN.

BEEN DADDY 'N ME
EVER SINCE.

I'M SORRY.

WHAT'S YOUR
MOM LIKE?

SHE'S A HUGGER.

AND A TEETOTALER.

ME TOO!

UM, TEETOTALER,
THAT IS.

YEAH, SHE'S
A TEMPERANCE WOMAN.

WHAT DID SHE THINK ABOUT YOUR
LEAVIN' TO PLAY BASEBALL?

WELL, TO BE HONEST, SHE AND PA
WEREN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT.

THEN WHY'D
YA LEAVE?

IT'S NOT THEIR
LIFE TO LIVE.

DO YOU REALLY
THINK IT'S YOURS?

WHO ELSE'S
WOULD IT BE?


ALRIGHT, SON,
YOU'VE GOTTA NEW BAT.

SHE'S A BEAUT.

YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAIN IT
OR DOUSE IT UP

WITH SOME LINSEED OIL
TO SEAL IT.

MUCH OBLIGED.

THINK I'LL STAIN IT
BLACK FOR GOOD LUCK.

HOW MUCH DO
I OWE YA?

IT'S YOURS.

BUT NOT FOR LUCK.

GOD'S GIVEN YOU A GIFT.

USE IT
FOR HIM.

THANK YA.

GOOD TALKIN' TO YA,
GINNIE.

GOOD NIGHT,
YA'LL.

'NIGHT, WILL.

GOOD NIGHT.


HEY TOWN BOY...

WHY DON'T YOU TRY
THIS ON FOR SIZE?

[GRUNTS AND GROANS]

YOU IDIOT!

THAT THING COULDA
KILLED ME!

A SHAME IT DIDN'T.

EVERYTHING JUST GOES
YOUR WAY, DON'T IT?

WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU GIT BIT?

A COPPERHEAD
WON'T KILL YA.

JUST MAKE YA SWELL UP
AND HURT A LITTLE.

I RECKON IT SERVES
YOU RIGHT.

[SHOUTS IN PAIN]

YOU NEED TO GET
THAT LOOKED AT.

I'VE BEEN
SNAKE BIT BEFORE.

IT AIN'T NOTHIN'.

NO, YOU NEED TO GET
TO A DOCTOR!

I DON'T NEED
ANY HELP FROM YOU!

YOU KNOW, PIKE, PROB'BLY WENT
TO GIT HIM A JAR A' SHINE.

YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD
DO WITH A JOLT YERSELF.

MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU JOINED
THE TEAM FOR REAL.

I THINK MAYBE EVEN
MY MA'D UNDERSTAND

IF I TOOK A SWIG
AFTER WHAT I SEEN TONIGHT.

YA REALLY THINK SO?

NO.

BUT I'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT
THE FUSS IS ALL ABOUT

IF I DON'T AT
LEAST TRY IT.

HERE'S TO
THE TEAM.

WELL?

THAT'S THE WORST STUFF
I'VE EVER TASTED!

NOBODY EVER LIKES
THEIR FIRST SWIG.

BUT IT'LL GROW
ON YA.

YOU'LL SEE.

AND NOW I KIN OFFICIALLY TOAST
YA AS A BONA FIDE MEMBER

OF THE NEWTON SLUGGERS.

WELCOME ABOARD,
TOWN BOY.


STRIKE ONE.

[WACK!]


[WACK!]


[WACK!]


[CAR ENGINE]

[WACK!]


WAY TO GO
IRON WILL!

[CAR HORN]

CAN WE GIVE YOU
LADIES A LIFT?

NO, THANK YOU.

CAN I PICK YOU UP LATER
AND BRING YOU BACK?

NO, THANK YOU.

HEY, THAT BILLY SUNDAY MEETIN'
IS COMIN' UP ISN'T IT?

THIS FRIDAY NIGHT.

YOU RECKON WE CAN CARRY
YA'LL OVER IN MY AUTOMOBILE?

THAT WON'T BE
NECESSARY.

GINNIE, WHAT'S
WRONG WITH YOU?

WILL, DO YOU
HAVE ANY IDEA

HOW MUCH THE BOYS IN
THE MILL LOOK UP TO YA?

I DO HAVE QUITE
A LITTLE FOLLOWING.

YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT JUST BASEBALL

THAT THEIR GONNA
FOLLOW YOU INTO.

IMOGENE, WE CAN COME
INTO TOWN ANOTHER DAY.

LET'S GO.

WAIT, GINNIE.
WAIT A MINUTE, GINNIE.

WAIT A MINUTE.

DON'T FOLLOW ME.

LOOK, I KNOW HOW THINGS LOOKED
AT THE GAME THE OTHER DAY.

I THOUGHT YOU
WERE A CHRISTIAN.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

WERE YOU DRUNK?

GINNIE, LISTEN.

I PROMISED MA BEFORE I LEFT THAT
I WOULDN'T EVEN TOUCH A DROP.

WHAT YOU SAW AT THE GAME
THE OTHER DAY -

THAT WAS JUST
THE TEAM DRINKING.

WELL, IT LOOKED LIKE YOU
WERE GOING RIGHT ALONG

WITH THE REST OF THEM.

YEAH, I KNOW, THEY DO KINDA
GIVE ME A HARD TIME ABOUT IT.

YOU'RE SURE WE CAN'T
GIVE YOU A RIDE NOW?

THANKS FOR THE OFFER
BUT WE'LL WALK.

LET'S GO.

CHICK, LOOKS LIKE I'M
BACK ON THE WATER WAGON.

WHAT?

WHY?
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

NEVER MIND.

BUT I'M DONE
DRINKIN' FOR GOOD.

I MADE UP MY MIND.

[CAR ENGINE AND MUSIC]

I KNOW OF A WORLD THAT
IS SUNK IN SHAME,

WHERE HEARTS ARE
FAINT AND TIRE,

BUT I KNOW OF A NAME,
A PRECIOUS NAME,

THAT CAN SET
THAT WORLD ON FIRE.

IT'S JESUS CHRIST,
THE SON OF GOD.

THIRTY-TWO YEARS AGO I WALKED
DOWN A STREET IN CHICAGO IN

COMPANY WITH SOME BALL PLAYERS
WHO WERE FAMOUS IN THIS WORLD.

SOME OF THEM
ARE DEAD NOW.

IT WAS SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

AND WE GOT TANKED UP AND WENT
DOWN AND SAT ON A STREET CORNER.

SAY, I NEVER GO BY THAT PLACE,
BUT I THANK GOD FOR SAVING ME.

IT'S VAN BUREN STREET,
CHICAGO.

WELL, AS I SAY, WE SAT DOWN ON
A CORNER AND ACROSS THE STREET,

A COMPANY OF MEN AND WOMEN
WERE PLAYING ON INSTRUMENTS

AND SINGING THE OLD GOSPEL SONGS
I USED TO HEAR MY MOTHER SING

BACK IN THE LOG CABIN
IN AMES, IOWA

AND BACK IN THE CHURCH WHERE
I USED TO GO TO SUNDAY SCHOOL.

AND GOD PAINTED ON THE CANVAS
OF MY MEMORY A VIVID PICTURE

OF THE SCENES OF OTHER
DAYS AND OTHER FACES-

MANY HAVE LONG SINCE
TURNED TO DUST.

AND I SOBBED
AND I SOBBED.

AND A YOUNG MAN STEPPED
OUT AND HE SAID,

"WE'RE GOING DOWN
TO THE RESCUE MISSION.

WON'T YOU COME
DOWN AND JOIN US?"

I SAID,
"WHAT WILL I HEAR THERE?"

HE SAID, "YOU'LL HEAR DRUNKARDS
TELL HOW THEY'VE BEEN SAVED.

"YOU'LL HEAR GIRLS TELL
HOW THEY'VE BEEN SAVED

IN THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT."

WELL, I TURNED AND I SAID
TO THE BOYS, "WE'RE THROUGH.

WE'VE COME TO THE PARTING
OF THE WAYS."

AND I TURNED
MY BACK ON THEM.

ONE OF THEM LAUGHED,
ONE OF THEM MOCKED ME,

OTHERS NEVER
SAID A WORD.

THIRTY-TWO YEARS AGO, I TURNED,
AND WENT DOWN TO THAT MISSION,

FELL ON MY KNEES AND
STAGGERED OUT OF MY SIN

AND INTO THE ARMS
OF THE SAVIOR.

SAY, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN WASHED
IN THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB OF GOD?

HAVE YOU EVER TURNED FROM
YOUR OWN SINFUL WAY OF LIVING

AND ASKED JESUS
TO SAVE YOUR SOUL?

I WONDER IF THERE
IS SOMEONE HERE TODAY

WHO WOULD ASK JESUS
TO SAVE HIM.

HE HAS MADE ALL THE
DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE.

HE'LL DO
THE SAME FOR YOU.

JESUS SAID, "I AM THE WAY,
THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE.

NO MAN COMETH UNTO
THE FATHER, BUT BY ME."

GOD HELP YOU
TO DO IT.

RODEY,
LET'S SING A SONG.

I'VE WANDERED FAR
AWAY FROM GOD.

NOW I'M COMIN' HOME.

THE PATHS OF SIN
TOO LONG I'VE TROD

NOW, I'M COMIN' HOME.

COMIN' HOME, COMIN' HOME,
NEVER MORE TO ROAM;

COMIN' HOME, COMIN' HOME,
NEVER MORE TO ROAM;

OPEN WIDE,
THINE ARMS OF LOVE

LORD, I'M COMING HOME.

KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE LORD.
W.A. SUNDAY.

THANK YOU,
SIR.

YOU'RE WELCOME.

NICE TO
MEET YOU.

YOU TOO.
GOD BLESS YOU.

MR. SUNDAY,
I WANT TO THANK YA.

YOU'RE WELCOME, SON.

EVERYTHING YA
SAID TONIGHT,

IT WAS LIKE YOU
WAS SPEAKIN' TO ME ALONE.

I GAVE MY HEART
TO CHRIST TONIGHT.

YOU'LL NEVER
BE SORRY, SON.

WHAT'S THE NAME?

CHARLES SPANGLER.

CHARLES.

I GREW UP
IN THE MILL.

MY DADDY
WAS BAD TO DRINK.

SO MY FOLKS NEVER TOLD
ME HOW TO BE SAVED.

GROWING UP IN A CHRISTIAN
HOME WON'T SAVE ANYONE.

MY OWN BOYS,

THEY HAVE THEIR STRUGGLES,
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

EVERY SOUL MUST COME
TO CHRIST FOR HIMSELF.

IT'S NOT A
FAMILY DEAL.

HEY, UM, THIS HERE'S
MY FRIEND, WILL WRIGHT.

(MR. SUNDAY)
HELLO, WILL.

WE PLAY BASEBALL
FOR NEWTON MILL.

IS THAT RIGHT?

JOE JACKSON GOT HIS START
DOWN HERE, DIDN'T HE?

THAT'S RIGHT, SIR!

OH, IT'S A GREAT GAME.
I LOVED IT DEARLY.

BUT, AS I
SHARED TONIGHT,

I FOUND A HIGHER CALLING
WHEN I FOUND CHRIST.

THAT'S WHY YOU
LEFT BASEBALL?

WELL, I PLAYED FOR A FEW
YEARS AFTER I GOT SAVED,

BUT I FELT LIKE I WAS-

LIKE I WAS WEARIN'
SOMEONE ELSE'S SHOES.

I STILL LOVE THE GAME...

YOU ROUNDED THE BASES
IN 14 SECONDS.

AND NOW I ROUND THE PLATFORM
IN 2 HOURS.


YOU RECKON' YOU
COULD SIGN MY BIBLE?

SURE.

NICE TO MEET YOU.

THANK YOU, SIR.

CHICK, WE'RE SO GLAD
FOR YOUR DECISION!

THANK YOU
FER INVITIN' ME.

I'VE BEEN
PRAYIN' FOR YOU.

THANKS FOR THET -
IMOGENE.

HAVE YOU TALKED WITH HIM ABOUT
CHRIST BEFORE?

I DON'T RECOLLECT.
MAYBE I HAVE.

WILL - WHEN DID YOU
ASK CHRIST TO SAVE YOU?

WHEN I WAS
REAL LITTLE.

I CAN'T HARDLY
REMEMBER.

BUT YOU DO REMEMBER
IT HAPPENED?

YEAH, MY MA PRAYED
WITH ME.

MAY I SEE WHAT MR. SUNDAY
WROTE IN YOUR BIBLE?

SURE.

"TO WILL, KEEP YOUR EYES ON
THE LORD. W.A. SUNDAY."

SO, UM, EZEKIEL, WHAT DID
YOU THINK OF MR. SUNDAY?

WELL, I'M THANKFUL FOR HIS
STRONG STAND FOR RIGHT.

GRANTED THE WAY HE SLANGS
UP THE GOSPEL

IS A BIT UNDISTINGUISHED
FOR A PREACHER,

BUT HE DOES SEEM TO CONNECT
WITH THE COMMON MAN-

WELL, I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU HERE!

WILL!
OH, MY DEAR BOY.

LIKE I SAID,
SHE'S A HUGGER.

MA, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
A FRIEND OF MINE.

YES, DEAR.
OF COURSE.

THIS IS GINNIE DOUGLAS.

SHE'S A SECRETARY
DOWN AT THE MILL.

I'M PLEASED TO MEET YOU, MA'AM.

AND I YOU,
GINNIE.

HOW DO
YOU DO?

I KNOW
THE YOUNG LADY.

HOW ARE YOU,
VIRGINIA?

I'M DOIN' FINE,
MR. HAMPTON.

IS YOUR
FATHER HERE?

YES, HE'S OUTSIDE GATHERING UP
THE BOYS IN THE TRUCK.

UH, VIRGINIA'S
FATHER IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR THE BOY'S RECREATION
DOWN AT THE MILL.

IN FACT, IF YOU
WOULD EXCUSE ME,

I'D LIKE TO GO THANK HIM FOR
BRINGING A GROUP OUT TONIGHT.

LADIES.

MR. HAMPTON TELLS ME YOU'RE AN
APPRENTICE MACHINIST, WILLIAM.

WELL HE'S JUST
PUTTING IT KINDLY.

I JUST LOOK
AFTER THE LOOMS

AND THEN IF SOMETHING
GOES WRONG THEN,

I GO AND GET
REAL HELP.

WILL'S TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT YA.

GOOD THINGS,
I HOPE?

YES.

I'M SO PLEASED TO HEAR ABOUT THE
PROMISE YOU ASKED HIM TO KEEP.

HE TOLD YOU?

WELL,
I'M GLAD HE DID.

WILL?

YES, MA?

I'M THANKFUL THAT YOU HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN THE PROMISE

THAT YOU MADE TO ME THE NIGHT
YOU LEFT HOME.

CAN YOU LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND TELL ME YOU'VE KEPT IT?

MA, THIS IS HARDLY
THE TIME OR PLACE

TO BE TALKING ABOUT
PERSONAL MATTERS.

WHAT IS THERE
TO TALK ABOUT?

OKAY,
I TRIED IT.

BUT I HATED IT.

I JUST PROMISED MY PAL
THE OTHER DAY

THAT I WOULD NOT EVEN
TOUCH ANOTHER DROP.

WILL,
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

IT'S OKAY, MA,
I'M DONE FOR GOOD.

WILL, WILL YOU COME
HOME FOR A VISIT?

I CAN'T, MA.
I'M SORRY.

I'M A JUST A BIT TIED UP
TONIGHT.

PA, YOU'LL BE GLAD TO KNOW
I'M HITTING WELL.

I MIGHT MAKE IT
OUT OF THE MILL.

IS THAT RIGHT?

WELL, IF NOT TONIGHT,

MAYBE SOME SUNDAY YOU CAN MAKE
IT HOME AND BRING YOUR FRIENDS.

I'LL SEE IF I CAN MAKE
THAT WORK, MA.

WE'D BETTER GO.

SO ANYWAY, PEP,
THIS MR. SUNDAY

HE DELIVERS HIS SERMONS
LIKE A MAN ON FIRE.

SAYS IT DON'T MATTER
HOW RICH YA ARE-

OR HOW SMART YA ARE-

OR EVEN HOW FAMOUS.

EVEN IF YOU MAKE THE HALL OF
FAME- IT AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

YOU GOTTA PUT YER
FAITH IN CHRIST ALONE.

OH, SPANGLER,
ARE YOU PREACHIN' OR PITCHIN'?

I'M PITCHIN'.

THEN SHUT UP
AND PITCH.

'TWEEN YOUR FOOL PREACHIN' AND
YOUR BROTHER'S FOOL SNAKE BITE,

WE'RE THE WORSE OFF
FOR THE BOTH A' YA.

AND AS FOR YOU, WRIGHT, YOU
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE SLEEP WALKIN'.

LET'S SEE SOME
PEP OUT THERE.


READY TO GO?

I...I GOTTA GET SOMETHING
TO DRINK.

I THOUGHT YA'S
ON TH' WAGON.

YEAH, I JUST,
I DON'T KNOW.

I JUST DON'T
FEEL LIKE MYSELF.

WILL, YOU BETTER
STAY AWAY FROM IT.

LOOK, I'M GLAD YOU'RE A
CHRISTIAN NOW AND EVERYTHING,

BUT JUST CUT IT OUT,
DOGGONE IT!!!

WHEN YA FIRST COME,
YA NEVER TOUCHED IT.

WHEN I FIRST CAME,
YOU WANTED ME TO!

I'M AS SORRY AS
I KIN BE FOR THET.

YOU KNOW THE BIBLE SAYS TAKE
A LITTLE WINE FOR THE STOMACH.

YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT,
DID YOU?

YOU'RE USIN' THE BIBLE
TO JUSTIFY BOOZE?

HEY, MR. HOLY ROLLER,
JUST QUIT TRYIN' TO SHOVE

RELIGION DOWN EVERYBODY
ELSE'S THROAT!

HEY, JOHN.

HEY, CHICK.

HEY, CAN YOU GIVE ME
A HAND A SECOND?

SURE, WHAT DO
YOU NEED?

TURN THAT THING
ABOUT A QUARTER TURN.

OH, YEAH, THAT'S
GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.

THANK YOU.

CAN I ASK
YA SOMETHIN'?

SURE.

D'YA KNOW CHRISTIANS
THET DRINK?

THAT'S A LONG STORY.

THERE ARE SOME
CHRISTIANS THAT DRINK.

WHOLE DENOMINATIONS
ALLOW "MODERATE DRINK."

I DON'T SEE HOW
THEY CAN JUSTIFY IT,

BUT THEY SAY AS LONG
AS THEY DRINK IN PRIVATE

OR DRINK JUST A LITTLE BIT THEY
WON'T HEAR ANY DIFFERENT-

EVEN THOUGH IT'S AGAINST
THE LAW OF THE LAND.

BUT THERE'S ONE THING
I DON'T HEAR 'EM SAY.

WHAT?

THEY'RE DRINKING

SO THAT GOD WILL BE
GLORIFIED IN THEIR LIVES.

RECKON NOT.

BUT THAT IS BIBLE.

"WHETHER THEREFORE,
YE EAT, OR DRINK,

OR WHATSOEVER YOU DO,
DO ALL TO THE GLORY OF GOD."

PEOPLE DON'T OFTEN THINK
ABOUT GOD'S GLORY.

THEY THINK ABOUT THEIR
OWN PLEASURES INSTEAD.

PROHIBITION'S TH' RIGHT THING?

MAY SURPRISE YOU,

BUT SOMETIMES I WORRY ABOUT
THE EFFECTS OF PROHIBITION.

I FEEL LIKE
IT'S MADE IT HARDER

TO REACH SOME PEOPLE
WITH THE GOSPEL.

REALLY?

IF CHRISTIANS EVER
COME TO THE PLACE

WHERE WE THINK WE CAN
MAKE PEOPLE ACT LIKE

THEY KNOW THE LORD EVEN WHEN
THEY DON'T, THEY'LL HATE US.

AND MAYBE RIGHTLY SO.

THE CHOICE TO COME TO CHRIST
IS A CHOICE MADE IN THE HEART.

IT CAN'T BE FORCED
ON SOMEONE.

NOW, I KNOW THAT LIQUOR
IS THE BANE OF OUR SOCIETY.

AND I KNOW THAT LIVES ARE BEING
SAVED BY THE 18TH AMENDMENT.

BUT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM
IS STILL SIN

AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO
THAT ROOT IS FOR JESUS CHRIST

TO CHANGE THE HEART OF A MAN
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

MY PA WUZ
BAD T' DRINK.

HE LEFT AFTER LITTLE
BO COME 'LONG,

WENT BACK T' TH' MOUNTAINS
T' SELL MOONSHINE.

HE GOT REAL MEAN WHENEVER HE
GOT A SNOOTFUL OF THE STUFF,

SO WE WERE KINDA HAPPY
WHEN HE FINALLY TOOK OFF.

I HATE T' SAY IT.

I'M SORRY TO HEAR
THAT, CHICK.

GIVE ME A HAND.

PICK IT UP JUST A LITTLE.

THERE YOU GO.

ALRIGHT.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M DOIN' WRONG.

I'VE ONLY BEEN A CHRISTIAN
FOR A FEW DAYS.

BUT, IT SEEMS NO ONE ON
THE TEAM KIN STAND ME.

EVEN WILL.

HE SAID I'M ACTIN'
LIKE A HOLY ROLLER.

WILL SAID THAT?

YES, SIR.

BUT THEN, I GIVE HIM
HIS FIRST DRINK.

I KNOW I'LL HAVE
TO ANSWER FOR THAT.

GINNIE TOLD ME HE TOOK
A PLEDGE NOT TO DRINK.

I THINK HE DID,
THEN HE WENT OFF IT.

I'M AFRAID HE GOT
A TASTE FOR IT NOW.

WELL, MAYBE YOU AND I -
OR GINNIE -

ONE OF US CAN
TALK TO HIM.

DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE HE'S
A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN?

I RECKON.

HE DON'T TALK MUCH
ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

CHICK, DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD TAKE FRIDAY OFF?

I'M TRYING TO ORGANIZE A DAY
TRIP FOR THE MILL BOYS,

AND I SURE COULD
USE A HAND.

AH, YOU CAN
COUNT ON ME.

DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE ALRIGHT
IF I BRUNG WILL ALONG, TOO?

HE'D HAVE TO BE
BONE DRY.

DON'T YA WORRY.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF THET.

I'LL BRING LITTLE BO.

HE'S GOT A SOFT SPOT A MILE
WIDE FER THET BOY.

THET'LL DRY HIM RIGHT OUT.
GUARANTEE IT!

WELL GOOD.



OH, LOOK...

[EXCITED SCREAMING]

[EXCITED SCREAMING]

ALRIGHT, EVERYBODY STAY
TOGETHER AS A GROUP.

AND NOBODY IS TO GO OUT
IN THE WATER

DEEPER THAN WHAT
YOU CAN STAND IN.

RIGHT?

RIGHT.

AND THESE ARE YOUR
TWO LIFEGUARDS.

YOU DO WHATEVER
THEY TELL YOU TO DO.

OR ELSE I'LL PUT YOU IN
THE BACK OF THE TRUCK

WITH ME AND GINNIE,
RIGHT?

RIGHT.

AND EVERYBODY KEEP YOUR
LONG JOHNS ON ALL DAY!

RIGHT?

RIGHT.

SAY RIGHT?

RIGHT!

GO IN!

[EXCITED SCREAMING]

PRISONERS HAVE BEEN
SET FREE!

YEAH.

I SEE YOU LIKE TO
SPLASH, HUH!

CAN I BE NEXT?

YEAH,
YOU CAN BE NEXT.

OKAY,
YOU TOO.

LINE UP
FOR CANNON BALLS!

I HOPE I'M NOT
INTERRUPTIN'.

WELL, YA ARE,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

THAT THE INTERRUPTION
IS UNWELCOME.

WILL, I WANTED TO ASK
YA SOMETHIN' ANYWAY.

ALRIGHT, ASK AWAY.

ALRIGHT...

WELL...

WILL, HAVE YOU KEPT YOUR
PROMISE TO YOUR MAMA?

WELL, I GUESS THERE'S NO
USE TRYIN' TO FOOL YA.

I KEPT IT TIL THE NIGHT PIKE
INITIATED ME TO THE TEAM

WITH A FULL GROWN
COPPERHEAD.

THEN, I STARTED DRINKIN'
WITH THE TEAM.

I WAS TOO ASHAMED TO TELL
YOU ON THE ROAD INTO TOWN

AND SO I TOLD YOU ABOUT
THE PROMISE I MADE

AND I SET OUT
TO KEEP IT.

HAVE YA?

I DID FOR A WHILE.

I DON'T KNOW.

SOMETIMES I KINDA
FEEL LOUSY WITHOUT IT.

WILL,
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

I KNOW.

MY PA HAD A BROTHER THAT DRANK
HIMSELF TO DEATH, AS THEY SAY.

THAT'S WHY HE NEVER
WANTED EITHER OF US BOYS

TO EVEN TOUCH IT.

THEN, WHAT POSSESSED
YOU TO DO IT?

UH, I JUST FIGURED I WAS OLD
ENOUGH TO MAKE MY OWN CHOICES

AND NOT DO WHATEVER
MY PARENTS SAID.

SO, YOU DIDN'T TELL
THE TRUTH THAT NIGHT.

NO. I'M SORRY,
GINNIE.

WILL, YOU NEED
TO GET HELP.

NO, I DON'T NEED HELP, I JUST
NEED TO QUIT IT, AND I WILL.

IN YOUR OWN STRENGTH?

WELL, I'M NOT GONNA LET
ANYONE ELSE DO IT FOR ME.

LOOK, GINNIE, I'VE NEVER
KNOWN ANYONE TO CARE ABOUT.

I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO TELL YOU THIS,

BUT I CARE ABOUT YOU
AND WHAT YOU THINK.

THEN STOP PLAYIN'!

WHAT?
BASEBALL?

I MEAN - LIFE!

NO. NO, I CARE ABOUT YOU TOO,
WILL WRIGHT.

TOO MUCH TO IGNORE
YOUR WALK WITH GOD.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

YOU JUST ADMITTED THAT YOU
WANT TO DO IT ALL ON YOUR OWN.

YOU!
IT'S ALL YOU.

YOU'RE TOO PROUD
TO GET HELP.

WILL, ARE YOU
A CHRISTIAN?

WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

I TOLD YOU I'VE BEEN
A CHRISTIAN MY WHOLE LIFE.

I KNOW THAT'S
WHAT YOU SAY.

BUT I DON'T SEE-

WHAT?
WHAT DON'T YOU SEE?

WILL, ARE YOU A CHRISTIAN
IN YOUR HEART?

OR ARE THEY
JUST WORDS YOU SAY?

YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

GINNIE, I'VE BEEN
WRONG AND I'M SORRY.

WILL YOU FORGIVE ME
AND GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE?

FORGIVE YOU FOR WHAT?

FOR DRINKIN'.

I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE LIED TO YOU.

GINNIE, I KNOW IN
MY HEART I CAN QUIT.

I'LL EVEN GET HELP.

ARE YOU JUST SAYIN'
THAT TO PLEASE ME?

GINNIE, I'LL DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

NO! NO YOU CAN'T
JUST DO WHAT I WANT.

WILL, IN YOUR HEART DO YOU
WANT TO PLEASE JESUS CHRIST

BECAUSE YOU BELONG TO HIM,
BODY AND SOUL?

OR DO YOU JUST
WANT TO PLEASE ME?

CAN'T I DO BOTH?

THIS FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN US -
WHATEVER IT IS - IT HAS TO END.

I'M SORRY, WILL.

BUT I AM NOT
HELPIN' YOU.

GINNIE.

I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T...



[DISAPPOINTED MOANS]

HEY SLUGGER.


WILL, WILL, DO YOU HAVE ANY
IDEA HOW MANY PEOPLE

ARE LOOKING FOR YOU?

C'MON, C'MON.

NO, NO, THIS WAY,
REMEMBER?



YOU'RE UP.

C'MON, WRIGHT!
WE NEED A RUN!

IT'S THE FINAL PLAYOFFS,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!


LET'S GO.

[DISAPPOINTED MOANS]

TO HIT THE BALL.

C'MON SCOOP,
GET THET TOWN BOY OUTTA HERE.

TAKE HIM OUT.

IT'S OKAY, WILL.
YOU'LL HIT IT NEXT TIME!

THERE AIN'T GONNA BE
NO NEXT TIME, WRIGHT.

YOU'RE OUTTA
THIS GAME!

YOU'RE OUT
OF THE NEXT ONE, TOO.

YOU'RE A DISGRACE
TO NEWTON MILL!

BUT, IF I DON'T PLAY THE FINAL,
THE SCOUT WON'T SEE ME.

YOU DON'T WANT NO SCOUT
TO SEE YA!

OUTTA ALL THESE MUGS,
I EXPECTED MORE OUTTA YOU.

HEY TOWN BOY,

BET YOU NEVER BEEN
CALLED A DISGRACE

TO A MILL BEFORE,
HAVE YA?

SHUT UP, PIKE.

FINALLY GET TO SEE YOU
RIGHT WHERE YOU BELONG.

AT THE BOTTOM A' THE HEAP 'NEATH
A WHOLE TEAM A' LINTHEADS.

I SWEAR,
DON'T PUSH ME.

YEAH?

I SEEN THE GAME, YOU COULDN'T
HIT ME EVEN IF'N YA WAS TO TRY.

THERE HE IS,
CHICK!

PIKE,
LEAVE HIM ALONE!

YA HERE THAT,
IRON WILL?

MY LITTLE BROTHERS,
THEY'RE TRYIN' TO HELP YOU.

THEY WANT ME
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE.

WATCH OUT WILL!

BO, GO HOME.

THE BOTH OF YOUS!

THIS HERE IS BETWEEN
ME AND THE TOWN BOY.

I AIN'T FIGHTING
A ONE-ARMED MAN!

DON'T YOU WALK
AWAY FROM ME!

[WACK!]

I SAID-
LEEEEAVE ME ALOOOOONE!!!!

[WACK!]

C'MON BO? BO.

NO. NO!!

WILL, WHAT DID
YOU DO?

YOU KILLED HIM.

YOU KILLED HIM!!!

NO. PLEASE, GOD, NO!

HE AIN'T DEAD!

HE'S STILL
BREATHING!

PIKE, WE GOTTA GET HIM
TO THE INFIRMARY!

RUN AHEAD
AND GET THE DOC.

PIKE!

IT'S A BAD BUMP, BUT HE'S
BREATHING STEADILY NOW.

AND HE'S GOING
TO BE OKAY.

WILL,
BO'S NOT DEAD.

HE'S KNOCKED OUT
BUT HE AIN'T DEAD.

DON'T DO
ANYTHING CRAZY!

JUST LEAVE
ME ALONE.

NO, I'M NOT GOIN'
ANYWHERE.

THEN I'LL GO-

NO, YOU'RE STAYIN'
'TIL WE TALK.

THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS HOW
MUCH I HATED YOUR BROTHER.

HOW I WANTED
TO HURT HIM BAD.

BUT IF BO DIES-

BO AIN'T GONNA DIE.

YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!

I KNOW HE'S
IN GOD'S HANDS.

WE KIN PRAY FOR HIM.

DON'T - TALK TO ME -
ABOUT GOD!

YOU WON'T EVEN
PRAY FOR HIM?

GOD WON'T HEAR
MY PRAYER.

SURE HE WILL.

GOD HEARS
ALL PRAYERS.

YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR
BIBLE LIKE I DO.

THE BIBLE SAYS IF THERE'S SIN
IN MY HEART, GOD WON'T HEAR ME.

THEN GET RID
OF THE SIN.

THET'S ALL THE BIBLE
I DO KNOW.

MR. SUNDAY SAID, IF YA TURN FROM
YER SIN, GOD'LL FORGIVE YA.

HE WANTS TO.

THAT'S ALL THERE IS
TO BEIN' A CHRISTIAN

JUST ASKIN' JESUS FORGIVENESS
FOR YER SINS.

IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE.

WHY NOT?

MY WHOLE LIFE
IS A LIE.

I'VE ALWAYS SAID WHATEVER
PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR.

BUT IN MY HEART I NEVER
TURNED FROM MY SIN.

YA KIN CHANGE THET.

I'VE HEARD ABOUT BEING
A CHRISTIAN FOR SO LONG-

IT'S NOTHIN'
BUT WORDS.

DON'T JIST
SAY THE WORDS.

MEAN 'EM.

IT AIN'T THET
HARD TO DO.

I WOULDN'T EVEN
KNOW HOW...

WILL, ARE YA SORRY
FOR YER SINS?

I AM.

DON'T TELL ME.

TELL HIM.

I AM SORRY
FOR MY SIN.

GOD, I'M SORRY FOR GOING AGAINST
YOU AND GOING MY OWN WAY -

FOR SAYIN' THAT
I WAS A CHRISTIAN

AND DOIN' WHATEVER
I WANTED TO DO.

I'M SORRY - FOR EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE DONE AGAINST YOU.

GOD, FORGIVE ME
FOR MY SIN.

PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

WERE YA JUST PRETENDIN'?

NO.

LET'S PRAY
FOR BO. OKAY?

YEAH.
OKAY.

[KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK]

YEAH.

CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

SURE, COME ON IN.

I HEARD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

BUT, YOU DIDN'T HEAR
ALL OF IT.

I ASKED THE LORD
TO SAVE ME.

IS THAT RIGHT?

I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO LOOK
SOMEONE IN THE EYE BEFORE

AND TELL THEM THAT
I KNOW I'M A CHRISTIAN.

BUT I CAN TODAY.

THAT'S AN ANSWER
TO PRAYER, WILL.

BUT THERE'S STILL SO
MUCH I DON'T KNOW.

WHEN I LEFT HOME -
THAT WAS WRONG.

WHEN I BROKE MY PROMISE
AND STARTED TO DRINK -

THAT WAS WRONG.

LETTING MY TEAM DOWN BECAUSE
OF MY DRINKIN'...IS MORE WRONG.

LYING AND ACTIN' LIKE
I'M SOMETHING I WASN'T.

I'M SO WRONG;
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET RIGHT!

I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I SHOULD
PLAY BASEBALL ANYMORE.

IT'S BEEN MY
WHOLE LIFE -

I - I JUST
DON'T KNOW!

IS BASEBALL
REALLY THE PROBLEM?

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

WELL, WHAT DID
BILLY SUNDAY SAY?

HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THE GAME ITSELF.

HE SAID HE FOUND
A HIGHER CALLING.

YOU'VE GOT A NATURAL
GIFT FOR BASEBALL.

I'VE WATCHED YOU DEVELOP IT
ALL SEASON.

YOU'VE GOT A GIFT FOR
WORKING WITH THE BOYS.

I'VE SEEN THAT
THIS SUMMER, TOO.

MAYBE YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO
TAKE ALL THAT GOD'S GIVEN YOU

AND BRING GLORY TO HIM.

I'M WILLING TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

THEN HE'LL MAKE IT
CLEAR TO YOU.

"IN ALL THY WAYS
ACKNOWLEDGE HIM."

HE'LL DIRECT YOU.

FIRST OFF, I HAVE A LOT OF
APOLOGIES I NEED TO MAKE.

SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD START.

CAN I SPEAK TO GINNIE?

WILL! BO'S AWAKE!
HE'S FINE!!

HE JUST WOKE UP.
HE'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT.

CAN I GO SEE HIM?

THET'S WHY I COME
TO GET YA!

CAN I COME
BACK LATER?

SURE, GO ON.

MRS. SPANGLER, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT WHAT I DID.

HAS BO -
IS HE AWAKE YET?

DOC SAYS IT WILL TAKE A COUPLE
OF DAYS FOR THE GOOSE EGG

TO GO DOWN
BUT HE'LL BE FINE.

HE'S UP.

I'M SO GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.

IS IT OKAY IF
I GO AND SEE HIM?

AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE
ASKED ABOUT YOU FIRST THING.

REALLY?

YES.

HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
FEEL BAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED!

HE DOES?

THERE IS NOTHIN'
YOU CAN DO

TO DIM THAT BOY'S ADMIRATION
OF YOU, WILL WRIGHT.

HE'S WAITIN' IN
THERE FOR YA.

GO ON IN.

IT'S AMAZING.

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,
I FEEL FREE!

IT DOES KINDA SEEM LIKE YOU'RE
BOUNCING OFF THE CLOUDS.

TO THINK FOR SO LONG I LIVED
TRYIN' TO ACT LIKE I WAS FREE -

I NEVER KNEW
HOW IT FEELS!

AND NOW I BET YOU'RE
JUST ITCHIN' TO GET BACK

INTO THE BATTER'S BOX.

WELL, THAT
I DON'T KNOW.

I APOLOGIZED TO THE TEAM
AT PRACTICE,

BUT SCOOP SAYS
HE STILL WON'T PLAY ME.

I CAN'T BLAME HIM.

THEN THE SCOUT MIGHT
NOT SEE YA PLAY?

HE MIGHT NOT.

BUT WHO KNOWS?

MAYBE SCOOP'LL CHANGE HIS TUNE
IF I SHOW UP AND ACT RIGHT.

I HOPE SO.

IT USED TO MEAN THE WORLD TO ME
IF I CAUGHT THE EYE OF A SCOUT.

I KNOW.

DON'T GET ME WRONG.

IT'S STILL THE CHANCE
OF A LIFETIME.

BUT THERE ARE SO MANY
OTHER THINGS I CARE ABOUT

MORE THAN BASEBALL.

LIKE...

WELL, BO -
HIM BEING OKAY.

I'M GOING TO GO SEE HIM AT THE
HOSPITAL RIGHT BEFORE THE GAME.

THAT'S A
GREAT IDEA.

AND OF COURSE,

I WANT TO BE RIGHT WHERE
GOD WANTS ME TO BE -

THAT MEANS THE
WORLD TO ME.

THAT'S THE BEST THING.

YEAH.

AND, WELL...

WHAT?

FRIENDS - THAT I'VE MADE
WHILE I'VE BEEN HERE.

GINNIE, I KNOW I TOLD YOU
AT THE LAKE THE OTHER DAY,

BUT I GOT
TO SAY IT AGAIN...

YOU'VE BECOME
MY BEST FRIEND.

I FEEL THE
SAME WAY.


POPCORN!

PEANUTS!

PEANUTS!

PEANUTS!
POPCORN!

IRON WILL!
YOU GOTTA GIT GOIN'.

THE FIRST INNIN'.

OKAY,

BUT YOU KNOW I'D

TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE
THERE, TOO, RIGHT?

IT'S OKAY.
I'M GETTIN' BETTER.

GOOSE EGG
GOIN' DOWN?

SOME.

CAN YOU HIT A HOME RUN
FOR ME TODAY?

I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL EVEN
GET A CHANCE TO BAT, BO.

WHY NOT?

WELL, GOTTA SAY IT.

I WAS LIVING FOR
MYSELF, BO,

AND I MESSED UP PRETTY
BAD FOR THE TEAM.

BUT THEY'LL GIVE
YOU ANOTHER CHANCE.

THEY JUST GOTTA!

WE'LL SEE.

BUT, HEY, I PROMISED TO GIVE YOU
A PLAY-BY-PLAY OF HOW IT WENT

WHEN I GET BACK, OKAY?

OKAY.

THANKS FOR COMIN'
TO SEE ME!

THANKS FOR BEING
MY BIGGEST FAN.

WILL, HIT ONE...
OUT...FOR ME.


NO!

NURSE! WE NEED
SOME HELP HERE!!

I'LL GET
THE DOCTOR.


ANYBODY SEEN
WRIGHT TODAY?

PROBABLY SLEEPIN' OFF HIS
MOST RECENT SPIFFLICATION.

I SEEN THET KINDA FLASH

BUT HE'S DIFFERENT!
I KNOW IT.

THEN WHY AIN'T

GINNIE, THANK YOU

I KNEW YOU'D
WANT TO BE HERE.

WILLIAM, I HAVE TO SAY I'VE BEEN
A BIT NARROW IN MY PERSPECTIVE

ON WHAT YOU COULD DO
WITH YOUR LIFE.

I'VE BEEN A BIT NARROW
IN MY PERSPECTIVE

ABOUT A GOOD
MANY THINGS.

BUT I AIM

THERE ARE NO STAINS ON
THE PAGES OF TOMORROW.

THAT'S RIGHT, SON.
THERE AREN'T.

WELL, YOU READY?
