Hell no!

Every time we barbecue,

What?

Man, why y'all trippin'.
l did bring something.

What'd you bring?

Beer, l brought beer.

Fool, you brought one 40-ouncer

Excuse me.
Damn!

How 're you doing, baby?
My name is Hay Love.

Hi.

Hey, Brisco, look who's here!

About time.
What the fuck took you so long?

Your mamma wouldn't let me go.

You keep talking that shit and l'm gonna
stop using Vaseline on your sister.

Pedro, let me help with your brew!

What you bring?
Pedro, why you trippin'?

What you bring, Hay Love?

That ass.

Damn! That's you?

Yeah.

Let me introduce myself

and tell her

Oh, no, no, no, no.

She don't like being
bothered while she eats.

Yeah, right, fool.

Look out!
Pedro!

Let me handle that brew.

Let me handle that brew, Pedro.
You can handle these nuts.

Hey, put this on the grill.
Oh, now l'm Benson.

No, just kidding.

What is it?
Carne asada.

Put that shit on.
Yeah.

Hey Brisco, you got some bones?
Oh, hell yeah.

Oh, yeah, yeah, hold up
a second though.

Hey homie, take a picture
real quick. l got my camera.

Picture of the homies.

All right.

You can't be hangin' no dominoes.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

Fool, you can't hang.

That's why l beat your ass

seven games last week
and took $200 from you.

Don't act like
you are used to this.

What the fuck?
So you're a history teacher now?

That was last week,
l'm talking about right now.

You'll never beat me again,
or take another dime from me.

Domino, motherfucker!

Am l a history teacher?
Yeah, l do current events, too.

You owe me 200 more
dollars and l want it.

Whatever man,
l'll get you that.

You guys be cheating!
l'll beat y'all ass.

Man, forget these dominoes,
let's get some bud.

Why you saying ''let's,''
like you got some money?

Man, l ain't had no bomb-ass bud
in about three months.

Well, let's get some.
From where?

My homie Big Will.

Wait a minute,
don't he live in 8 trays?

Man, he don't bang.
He just sell bud.

He may not bang, but all of them
fools around him do.

Them 8 trays
is crazy as a motherfucker.

My homie Cesar, plenty of bud.
He'll give it us for free, too.

And his daddy is Mexican mafia.

Well, we got to do one.
We need bud.

l ain't fucking with them.

Let's roll to my boy Cesar's then.

We'll be up out of the house
before his pops knows we're there.

l'd rather do that,
because 8 trays

is feuding with the little
knuckle heads from around here.

Homie, l'd say let's just get
something to drink and kick it.

What? We got drink.
We need bud.

Hay Love,
do you have some money?

Man, y'all know
l'm waiting on my check.

l'm just trying
to hook y'all up.

l mean, l might just want
to take a little hit.

Just like l thought.

lf you gonna charge me
for a couple of hits,

you can have
my last two dollars.

Two dollars?

Hit what?

Who got the bud?

Oh, shit!
Ray Ray?

When you get out?
Two hours ago.

What's up, Hay Love?

Uh, nothing.
You still a bitch!

Yeah, yeah,
pretty much.

Roll me up a fatty, fool.

Uh...
You heard me, bitch!

Roll me up a joint!

Hold up, homie,
we ain't got no weed.

Where you going?
l don't know.

Hay Love, where you going?
l don't know.

Hey homie, we was
trying to decide

on where we were going
to get the bud from.

Either Pedro's homeboy
or Hay Love's people, Big Will.

Big Will from 8 trays?

Man, he don't bang,
he just sell bud!

Yeah, well you go on with me.

What? We haven't decided
if we goin' over there or not!

l decide! l need to handle
some of them fools anyway!

l don't bang.
What you want from me?

Shut the fuck up, you go!
Homie, hold up.

You can't just be
kidnapping people and shit.

That shit's foul, man.

You just got out of jail.
Mm-hmm.

Shit don't work
like that no more.

Times have changed.

People get shot
for that shit now!

So, should l shoot
you motherfuckers?

Oh, shit!
Ray Ray's got a gun!

You just got out two hours ago.
How'd you get a gun already?

Ray Ray, calm down.

Do l look nervous? Brisco!

Do l look nervous?

No, actually you look
pretty fucking calm.

You know why?
Hay Love, do you know why?

Because 10 years in prison made you
realize that violence is not the way?

Hell no! Smoking fools
ain't no thing to me.

l'd kill all you motherfuckers
then sit down and eat cheesecake.

Get one big fat-ass pastramis from
the hamburger stand down the street.

Pedro, they still make
them pastramis?

Yeah.
Cool, we can get one on the way.

Man, l don't know!
Oh, oh! l'm sorry.

l have to apologize
to you, Hay Love.

Somewhere along the line
you got the impression

that you have a choice.

But if you don't get
your ass in that car,

l ain't gonna be mad,
but my gun...

gonna be pissed off.

Bye y'all.

l really need some bud now.

Man, l feel you but...

is fuckin' with your boy Cesar
and his father really worth it?

Man, after that shit, l'd steal some
weed out of the FBl evidence room.

You know what l'm sayin'?
l need to get high.

Well, let's do the damn thing.
Yeah.

Ray Ray, what you doing, man?

This is where they hang out at.

That's what l mean.
What the fuck are you doing?

Ray Ray, what you doing, man?

l'm gonna eat this pastrami,
then l'm gonna go over there,

and smoke either all
or some them fools.

For what?
When l was in the pen,

one of the homeboys
was talking shit to me.

So where is he?

He's still locked up.

So you mean to tell me you gonna shoot
up everybody except for him?

That's the way it goes, player.

What you want with me?
l'm gonna run!

Oh, you gonna run out on me?
Man, l ain't got no gun or nothing.

There you go.

What the fuck you want me
to do with this, throw it?

That motherfucker might work.

This old-ass gun,
who's is it, Wyatt Earp's?

Don't be shaking that motherfucker
around, it might go off.

What?

All l'm saying is, if you got
to sneeze or something,

you better put
the motherfucker down first.

Oh my God!
Why you soundin' like a little bitch?

l-- l-- uh--
Look, when l was in the pen,

all l could do is think
about smoking 8 trays.

When them motherfuckers
were fucking with big Ray Ray,

they didn't know
who they were fucking with.

Uh-uh-uh--
But it's too late.

Now l'm about to kill
all their asses.

l'm gonna go down to smoke--

what the fuck is wrong with you?

( gasping )

Hey!
( gunshot )

Oh shit! Oh shit!
Oh shit!

Hold up, hold up.
Hay Love!

Antwon!
Nigga don't be calling me that shit.

They call me Bit Ant!
No problem, Big Ant.

l mean, Bii-ig Ant.
l mean, Big, Big, Big, Big Ant!

Who's this nigga, cos?
We gonna off this nigga, or what?

Hell no,

What you doing with this fool?

Man, he kidnapped me.
l was just trying to get some bud!

You been taking care
of my little niece?

Yeah! Oh, hell yeah!

l went there
and dropped some diapers.

What? Nigga, she 12!
Oh!

You better get your ass
over there and help my sister.

That's what l'm gonna do
when l leave here.

l'm leaving here, right?

Damn, this is the boonies.

l thought you said he lived
in Hollywood Hills or something.

They do. When l called,
he gave me this address,

and said meet him here.

Oh!

Hey!

Hey, Will.
What's up, man?

How you doing?
What is up with the desert ranch?

This is where my dad
has his monthly fights.

Fights?

Hey, man, these are my boys,
J-Rob and Brisco.

Hey, what's going on?
Yeah.

What's happening?
Chillin'.

So, what's up with those fights?
My dad has these bad-ass fighters.

l mean, bad-ass dudes
that know all kinds of martial arts,

you know, like kick boxing,
grappling, all that shit.

He invites them here
once a month to fight,

then he invites some wealthy
friends over to bet on them.

You think we should be
knowing all this shit?

Don't worry about it bro,
my dad's cool. Come on in.

Man, you know,
no disrespect,

l just think we should just get a little
bud from you and then we'll roll out.

Nonsense.
Pedro, come on!

Just for a minute, man.
Yeah.

ln and out.

Come on, it'll be quick man.
He's right.

Just for a second.
All right!

Just for a minute.
Yeah, yeah.

Pedro.

You guys want anything to drink?

No, l'm cool.
Me too.

Pedro?
That's all right.

Lighten up.
Why are you guys so uptight?

lt's my dad, isn't it?

Oh no, man!
Hell no!

Yeah, it is-- you guys heard
all this crazy shit in the news

about how he's this crazy
maniac mob killer.

Naw.
Man, l ain't heard nothing.

l don't even watch the news.

You need to meet him.
l'm gonna go get him.

No, no, wait!
Hold up, hold up, Cesar, Cesar!

Damn!

What's up, Pedro? l ain't trying
to see this motherfucker.

What the fuck
you want me to do?

Speak some
Spanish or something

and get us up out
this motherfucker.

You got us caught up in shit.

Fuck you, J-Rob. You wanted
the weed as bad as l did.

l didn't.
Hey, guys...

this is my dad,
Fredrico Sanchez.

Hey, boys!

How you doing, Mr. Sanchez?
( laughs )

Sir.
Stop that Mr. Sanchez and sir stuff.

We're all family here.
Call me Fredrico.

Ooh! As a matter of fact,
call me Fred.

How are you, big guy!
Fine, Mr. Sanchez.

Not Mr. Sanchez, it's Fred.
Come on, say it.

Fred.
Ahh! There you go!

And how are you?

Oh, l'm-- l'm-- l'm fine sir.
Uhh-- ooh.

Fred.
Ahh.

Ahh, ooh.

And how about you?
l'm cool.

Yeah, huh?
Uh-go-goo!

See? l told you guys.
Pedro, didn't l tell you?

Yeah, yeah, you told us.
My dad's the coolest.

Well, thank you, son.
No problem.

l love you Dad.

l-l-l love you too, son.

Oh, Dad, can my friends
come to the fight?

Well... l guess it's okay.

As long as they know,
it's something

that cannot be spoken about
beyond these walls.

You guys understand, right?

Of course.
Definitely.

Don't even worry about it, Fred.

l guess it's no problem!

Now will you guys
have a drink?

Yeah, that's--
-Yeah, l'll have a drink.

l'll have a drink.
What do you suggest, Fred?

Oh, well, we ha--
we have excellent brandy.

That's cool.
Three brandies!

You want anything pop?
Oh, no.

l'll be right back.
Man, this is cool, big Fred.

l am glad you are
enjoying yourself.

Thank you for the hospitality.
Fuck you, you little bitch.

What's wrong, Fred?

You, call me Fred
one more time...

l swear l'll stick this fucking spoon
in your worthless throat, huh?

Oh my God!

l don't know how you three

hairy horse nuts know my son,

but l do know this,

my son means everything to me.

His mother died
when he was 11 years old,

God rest her soul.

The woman was a saint.

And after she died,

l protected him.
l sheltered him.

Private schools,
nannies, everything,

to keep him away
from losers

like you three.

Now, he's all grown, he likes,
as you would say,

to do his own thing!

And l cannot stop him,
and lf l try,

he will hate me.
But l can protect him.

So...

if he so much as catches a cold,

while he is around you,

that would be a vacation

compared to what l would do

to you three pieces
of pig shit.

Hey, Dad.
Hi, son!

Oh, ha, hey, you boys,

better get out there--
Mariano's about to fight!

And you know he's
your favorite, son.

( growls )
Let's go!

Out of all you stupid asses,

you seem to be the least stupid.

Uh... thank you.
Shut up.

l'm holding you personally
responsible for my boy.

lf anything happens to him,

l'm just going to kill
your friends, but you--

l am going to have
a doctor on the scene.

And every time my men
almost beat you half to death,

l'm going to have
the doctor bring you back.

That way l'll be able
to kill you five times.

ls your little brain able
to comprehend this?

Mm-hmm.

Well...

get the fuck out of my house,
you 're stinking idiot.

l see you were back there
talking to my dad. He's cool, huh?

Yeah, ice cold.

Oh, here come the fighters.
This is gonna be good.

What kind of satanic shit
is this, man?

l don't know, but weed or not,
l'm ready to bounce.

l've been ready to bounce, let's go.

What is bounce?

Oh, it means
giving thanks to the host.

Ahhh! l just hope you're not talking
about running out on my son.

That would make him very sad.

And when he gets sad,
l get mad.

No, sir.

Never.

Wouldn't think of it, sir.

Hey, Mariano.

This is gonna be good.
Let's go.

Ladies and gentlemen,

you are about
to witness a challenge

between two
major forces of nature.

Our current opponent,

weighing 260 pounds,
the Highlander...

versus our current
champion, weighing 275,

Mariano Big Dog.

Gentlemen, let's fight!

 How many niggas come to brawl
 Fight music

 Another motherfucker on the wall
 Fight music

 You come down right to your fall
 Fight music

Catching niggas
from the side of the car

 How many niggas come to brawl?
 Fight music

 A motherfucking fight on the wall
 Fight music

 You come down right to your fall
 Fight music

Catching niggas
from the side of the car

lntroducing the man of the year

From manic it's simply clear
when you examine you can fear

Like all of the sphere,
half cannibal half bear

Actions you spare if you know
a nigga badder than this

Laughing at all you fagots
some more

You still bat about as fast a dog

You can crash like a car...
natural fall

After the judge, rehab, and the ball
you won it all from cash wars

So you ask for a job
forget the predictions

Sickest niggas that listen
and even if you critics is bitchin'

My mission, pay the ammunition,
put on a hard hat

Don't call us relax
while l'm on combat

Study the opponents
l told you attack

Checkin the sources
for the niggas all that

Categorize a niggas rhymes all that

lt's a new testament
of an exclusive specimen

Diggin my boots in the best
of the niggas crews

No hype, no journalist writes
no sound bytes

Just a night of 1,000 mics
surrounding you sight

Pound for pound of might
now pounds of strikes

Shout out your price...

( chorus repeats )

Yeah!

( growling )
Yeah!

Mariano!

Hey, thank you, Cesar!
We're out of here, bro.

l thought we were
gonna chief one.

Oh, you know,

my boy J-Rob, you know?
He got the shits, bro.

Yeah, yeah,

l think l need
a cork or something.

l'm going with you guys. Dad!
No, no, no.

Dad.
ls everything okay, son?

Yeah, l'm gonna go
with my friends.

Hey, why don't you stay here with me,
son, you know, hang out?

Yeah, yeah, why don't you
kick it with pops?

Stay with the pops.
Ain't nothing like family, homie.

l've been here all day.
l want to get out for a while.

But Cesar--

Dad, you're not about to start treating
me like a child again, are you?

No, son, no. Go.

Go.

Thanks, Dad.

We'll be back later.
C'mon, guys, let's go.

Yeah.

Make sure you call my sister.
Tell her what l did for you.

Tell her to make some tacos tonight.
All right then, fa sho.

Baby, you rollin' with the greatest

Comin' threw
with nothin but the latest

Blowing trees, l tried to tell
these fools they can't keep up with me

Slippin' and slidin', drippin' and
ridin', on the streets clean mobbin'

Deep, in the back
keep ya heads bobbin'

Watch at the bus stop
as my trunk drop

When l stack up, wheels lookin'
like mirrors as they creep up...

Hey, we need to hurry up
and get this motherfucker home.

We need to make sure
nothing happens to him.

'Cause if it does,
our ass is grass.

Let's tell him we got to do something
and he got to go home.

Man, that's stupid.

You got a better idea?

Anything is better than that shit.
Fuck you!

Fuck you, punk!
Hey, this ain't gonna get us nowhere.

We're all a little upset.

l'm upset, he stupid.
You stupid.

What're you doing? Get over here
and smoke some of this bud.

Be right there, homie.

Come on, big dawg,

let's smoke this bud
so l can get back home.

You just want to smoke out
and go to the pad?

Yeah, that's why l'm here.
l can't smoke in front of pops.

So we just go hit this bud
and take you home.

Yeah, dude, what the fuck?
l mean, is that all right?

This might turn out to be cool.

Let's smoke this bud
and get rid of his ass.

l'm with that.
Yeah.

Fire it up, homie.

Oh, hell no, dawg,
l'm the one that's most stressed out.

Let me hit that shit first.

Be careful, that ain't the regular

Bro, let me
tell you something, homie.

( Jamaican calypso playing )
 J'american...

Ya, in the place mon

When the shot is a hot list,
Hollywood, nuff respect...

Just like that?

( laughing )

What's up?
Hey Love.

Man, weed got y'all acting like that?

lt's the bomb-diggity!

Man, y'all need to listen

Hay Love, man.

What you need to do
is come over here and hit this joint

and calm down.

On the moon.

And then tell us what happened.

l ain't never had no problem
smoking no weed.

l mean, that's what all the shit

( coughing )
Mama!

Now what you get
to tell us, dawg?

They got Ray Ray.
They got him.

l tried to tell him--

l tried to tell him let's get
some weed but he wouldn't listen.

He took out a gun,
and he gave me one.

See?

Damn, that's a raggedy-ass gun.

Then what happened, dawg?

Then he was talking shit to me,
and they snuck up behind us,

and bam!

Blood, brains and pastrami meat
all over me.

They got Ray Ray.

How'd you get away?

You remember that ugly bitch
l got pregnant?

Shaniqua.

Yeah, she ugly
and her baby ugly.

But l tell you what,

So today, l love ugly.
Viva la ugly, viva la ugly!

Oh shit.

Ahh, shit!

Ahh, shit!

You stupid motherfucker.
Ahh, shit!

Oh, shit!

Oh, shit!

You killed him!

Shoot yourself.

Shoot your damn self. Do it now!

Hold on, Brisco.
Fuck that.

lt was an accident!

lt doesn't matter.
We're still dead!

Accident?
You are fucking accident!

What we gonna do?

We gonna kill Hay Love.

No, l don't like that plan.
What good is that gonna do?

We call Fredrico, we'll tell him some
stupid-ass fucking retarded idiot

came in to rob us,
and he shot Cesar,

and we shot him,

and to prove it we'll take
Hay Love's dead body.

l don't like that plan.

We can't do it, Brisco.
Yes we can, yes we can.

Pedro, he trippin'.

Oh, no! Y'all gonna kill me?

Please don't kill me, please.

l'll do anything.
Wait a minute, l got a gun.

Y'all talking about
how you're gonna kill me.

l'll kill your motherfucker ass!

Homie, the trigger and the firing pin
fell off the gun when you shot it.

Nobody can use this gun.

We'll kill him with garden tools.

And that way
it'll look like we was mad.

We just went crazy!

Brisco, you trippin'.

You think of something!
lf you don't like my shit,

y'all think of something.

What you thinking, Pedro?

Just got to call Fredrico
and just tell him what happened.

You remember what he said
when we was there.

He just gonna kill y'all one time.

He gonna kill me
like five fucking times.

What?

Look, it doesn't matter.

We fucked up,
whether it was an accident or not.

His son is dead.
He deserves to know.

l ain't calling.

Make this motherfucker call.

Me?
Yeah, you stupid-- you did it.

l don't know what to say!

l'm gonna get that shovel, you get
the rake, let's bash his fucking head!

All right, all right, hold on, you damn
maniac gardeners, l'll do it!

Well, do it then.
Make the fucking call.

Damn, what's the number?

555-7395.

Hello, l don't know
how to tell you this but...

we accidentally
domed your son.

Oh, domed means...

shoot him in the head,
by accident though.

l'm sorry, but y'all need to come get
him or something-- he just lying here.

She taking it hard, man.

l know, ma'am, l'm sorry.
lt's fucked up.

Hey Love, who're you talking to?

l guess, his mother.
His mother?

She keep talking about ''my son, my son,
he's only eight years old!''

Does this motherfucker
look eight years old to you?

l don't know, l guess she's
delirious or something!

What number did you dial?
The number that you gave me.

555-7395?

95? l thought you said 7399!

Woman: Hello?
Oh, never mind.

You stupid.
Give me the phone.

l'll do it.

Mr. Sanchez?

There's been an accident.

Cesar didn't make it.

What did he say?
What did he say?

Before or after

he said
he was gonna kill us all?

Slowly, except for Brisco.

He said something about
killing you slowly times five.

And then there was just
a lot of screaming and crying.

Let's just call the police
and say it was an accident.

For what?
We still going to jail.

And they can get us
in prison just as easy.

We need help.
We got to hide.

And where are we going to hide?
They can find us anywhere we go!

We fucked!
We need to call Krago.

Yeah, that's your homeboy, right?

He'll know exactly what to do.

Who's he?

When we was kids, he used to be
in this fucked up abusive foster home,

so he ran away

and l used to take him
clothes and food and Cool-Aid and shit.

Why haven't l met him?
l never even heard of him.

He's a criminal.
He a baller though.

Shut up.
He's my dawg, though.

He just do his own thing
and l do mine.

Our lifestyles just don't mix.
Until now.

Oh, where's mommy?

Look, look, who is that?

That's mommy.
''Hi mommy, l miss you.''

Want some candy?

Look, ah, oh!

Ooh, candy!

Yay!

So many hopes and dreams

cut down--

cut down by some maggots

that don't deserve
to live another day.

l just want them to suffer.

Consistent pain
is all l want for these parasites.

Did someone call?

Can you bring them to me?

Sweetie, for the right price
l can find 2 Pac.

Then go,
go and do what you do.

Come on, come on

l'm gonna need y'all to bounce

Bounce, bounce

Bounce, baby

l'm gonna take y'all
for a ride

Come on, come on

Come on!

Seat belts on

l wish these scary motherfuckers

Watch ya tone, bitch

Why is my hot ass attire
as high as my tone?

l'm slagging these fools...

Hey, Krego,

That's my nigga, man.

Spider always
wants to hit a nigga.

What's up, Krego?
Oh, man, l can't complain.

l can see that.
Oh, yeah.

Hey, shit, we need your help.
Oh l know you need my help.

lt's a long story.

Listen...

That's some deep shit.
How did you know that, man?

How do l know that? l know everything

Look, man, that shit was an accident,
l'm telling you, dawg.

What l don't know is how you get

Hey, what's up?!

That answers the question.

Man, l got worried.

Y'all got honies back here,

Y'all back here partying while l'm

Look, l told you back in the days, man,

you gonna get caught up, homie.

You gonna get hit.

'Cause certain niggas

That's why when l did my shit,
right, l was on the low.

That's why l didn't hang out.

l know, homie,
no disrespect, dawg,

but l ain't really got time
to hear that shit right now.

Yeah, nigga,
you're right about that. Shit.

So, what should we do?

The first thing is--
this Fredrico nigga is for real, man.

Remember that Fredrico nigga?
Hell yeah, he wasn't no joke.

See, he powerful
and he got connections, man.

So, l've been thinking, right,

ain't nothing
you can do really at all,

you know what l mean?

He gonna catch y'all,
and he gonna smoke y'all niggas.

Tony.

Unless l change who y'all are.

What?
What?

What you mean?
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

Hey, y'all gots to roll.

Everybody beat it.
Everybody split.

Remember what
l told you though.

What l mean is, l gots
to change who you niggas is.

You mean like switch lD's?
'Cause l ain't got mine right now.

But l do got the little temporary one
DMV gave me, though.

Hay Love, shut up!

Y'all come on over here, man.
You crazy, nigga!

You know, as soon as l heard about what
was cracking l got something for you.

Oh, you knew
l was gonna come to you, huh?

Of course, nigga.
l'm the only nigga you can come to.

Who else?

You were the only one
l could come to, man,

when l was goin' through the shit
l was goin' through.

That's right.
Everybody knows this.

Which is why y'all got to get
the fuck out of my house.

l don't want Fredrico
coming over to this motherfucker.

Y'all can't blow up my spot.

Thank you, brother.
l know what you mean.

Now look,
when l tell you all this shit...

got to keep an open mind.
Y'all with me?

She's real cool.
lt's real easy.

Plastic surgery.

What?
Like titties? Ah, hell no!

lt's gonna be some big ass titties,

just as gonna be Hay Love with
big ass tities. Ain't gonna know it's--

Hay Love, shut up.

You don't care
if you get some big ass tities?

They talkin' about our faces, man.

You are talking about our faces, right?

Of course l'm talking about y'all
motherfuckin' faces, man.

Y'all look like y'all need to change
your faces any-motherfuckin'-way.

We gonna get
some tities on our faces?

Baby! Come here, baby.
Come here.

Get this nigga, take him in there,
and give him a motherfuckin' drink.

Or l'll shoot him
my goddamn self.

lt'll be Krego Fredrico, motherfucker.
Get him out of here.

This nigga crazy.

That's why you are all
in the shit you all into, man.

l don't know about this, dawg.
ls there something else we can do?

Bra, you don't
understand me, man.

This nigga ain't no motherfucking joke
y'all niggas is fuckin with, man.

l know, man, l know! But...

man, you're talking about
changing who l am, man.

Man, l ain't talking about changing
who you niggas is, man.

Who you are
is on the inside humming.

And nothing
could change that, you dig?

But the outside
is what needs to be changed.

Only thing is gonna be different
is the way y'all look.

He ain't gonna make us
look all crazy and shit, is he?

Yeah, l don't wanna look
all fucked up and shit.

You already look fucked up!
You crazy.

That ain't what's gonna
switch about the game.

l'm gonna make you look tight.
Well, fuck it then. Let's do it.

Y'all listen,
and y'all listen close, man.

Now that we got
Hay Love the fuck out of here.

These people, right?

Listen close,
how can l break this down spot?

Give it straight, dawg.

Now these people,
they're more dangerous

than the niggas
that's trying to fuck you all up.

You know what l mean by that?

They are not for play,
you understand?

Fuck it, where do we got to go?
Arizona.

Damn, they ain't got no local branch?
Yeah.

Hey hell no, man,
these niggas are discreet, nigga.

And they don't want a gang
of motherfuckers all in their mix.

Only a handful of people know
where these motherfuckers is at.

And they wanna
keep it that way, Brisc.

So, what do we do?

Well the first thing is,
you take you some money,

and you go to this location.
l'll write it down for you.

ls that the place in Arizona?
You're damn right.

Then what?

Then you go to the location
and they'll tell you what to do.

Y'all move fast,
and we're so slow.

Man, this shit sounds
like highly expensive, man.

How much
is all this shit gonna cost?

We'll get to that later!

Brisc, fuck with me,
work with me, man, goddamn!

And the second most important
motherfucker thing,

is this motherfuckin'
little dandy right here.

Let me find that shit
out of my motherfuckin' pocket.

Ha.

There's this card, you dig?
You understand?

Now without this card...

they definitely--
and insequently,

if you motherfuckers
show up without this,

they're gonna blow y'all
motherfuckin' ass off.

Remember, these niggas
is as crazy as the niggas

that's trying to blow
your head off now.

lf not more.

Y'all can't drive that bucket
y'all got out there, man.

Then how the fuck
are we supposed to get there?

You go grab Hay Butt,

and y'all motherfuckers
meet me in the garage.

Ha ha ha ha ha

Like a nigga baby,
like a nigga baby

Oh yeah,
yeah, oh yeah...

Oh shit!
Let's hit the club!

Oh, hell yeah!

Oh, shit man,
how much cheese is this?

This little bag, right?

That's for y'all surgery.

Y'all can get all hooked up and shit,
you know what l'm saying?

But this big bag though...

that's for y'all
to have a new life.

Mainly you, Brisc.

You know, when l was young,

you used to always
look out for me, homie, always.

l'm a nigga, man.
You know what l'm saying?

Shit! Without you...

l wouldn't be
the boss l am today.

lsn't that right?
Hell yeah.

He always said you kept it real, man,
looked out for him.

lt's my time to return
the favor, dawg.

Thanks, dawg.

You're my nigga, man.
Keep going strong.

You hear me?

Now get the hell
out of here, man.

Don't look back either, homie.
And take Hay Butt with y'all.

Y'all get you something like that
when you go wherever you go.

Yeah.

Well, you just bring
bad luck to yourself.

See, this is exactly
what l'm talking 'bout.

Ex-ac-tly!

You let some of them little
young-ass hoodlums

rent your property

and the next thing you know,
you pullin' down police tape.

You ain't never lie.

You damn right l ain't lying.

That the same thing happened
other day on 55th and Central.

What?

The other day,
at 55th and Central.

Lijah, what the fuck
do you be saying?

The other day
at Fifty-''fithe'' and Central.

Oh, shit!

Could you help me up and shut the fuck
up before you say anything?

Oh, motherfucker!
Where is my cane?

Do you want to just die?

Help me up! All right, nigga.

l got it, nigga.

Oh, Superman strong now.

My cane.
l can't get that motherfucker.

Sure, get it later.

Lijah, why can nobody understand
what the hell you be saying?

Everybody understand me just fine.

You just don't listen!
And that's your problem.

Oh, l listen!

But it sounds like you got shit
and shoestrings all over your mouth.

Listen!

Listen for what?

l already know everything!

Only thing
somebody could tell me

is some shit l already know.

Well, Lonnie, l swear for God,

you crazy enough
to be a maniac.

Now, the man can't listen,

and the man don't know
what he doing.

And the man who don't know
what he doing,

and the man is going be his own demise
and the Bible said that!

Bible said what?
What l just said!

Listen.

Listen for what?
l can't understand your old ass.

You old too.

l'm 23 days younger
than your ass.

You ignorant, too.

Lijah, l ain't thinking
about your ass.

Yes, you are.

You're a crazy fool.

( laughing )

Boy, you know you love me.

Lijah, you can go pee blood on the side
of that tree for all l care.

You're the one with the bad kidney.

Fuck you, Lijah.

Yeah, okay, well, you know what?

Lonnie, you seem to talk
a whole lot of shit.

Oh, you got up?

Yeah, l walk.

Sometimes l really think you
think you can get some of this!

Get some of what?
There ain't shit there!

You're certainly like a vulture.
Come get the meat, nigga.

What's the matter with you?

You are too old to be trying
to fight a motherfucker.

You trying to give me a case.

Now, that was amusing.

Now, l told you damn reporters
stay from around here.

They came and got that boy
out of here a long time ago.

Now you...

you and your ugly-ass
cameraman turn around,

and get the hell off my property.
Tell 'em.

That's what we're trying to do.

The boy went out
with his own family--

you need to do
your family and friends.

Can't do that.

First l have to find
who is responsible for all this.

Oh, hell no! Hell no!

You mean to tell me that
you understand what he's saying?

Perfectly.

Listen!

Get the hell off my property
and take this crazy-ass fool with you.

Sorry, sweetie.
lt ain't that easy.

Oh, l see.
l'm gonna have to go get my pistol.

What they doin'?
l don't know.

Does this look like a pistol?

Run, Lijah.

Damn! You too stupid to run!

Lonnie, l ain't gonna put
no pressure on my back leg.

Shit, l'd rather get shot than let
this bunion swell up on me again.

We just need to ask some questions
about your tenants and his friends.

A snitch? No problem.

Lonnie, don't you dare
snitch on them boys.

Look here, Lijah.
l give a damn about being a snitch.

We ain't in prison.

And if we was,
l sure would cut your ass.

There you go, there you go, trying
to be an old-ass gangster!

Boys!

l'm sorry, sweetie.
What is it that you need?

Where are they?

That l couldn't tell you.
l don't know.

What can you tell me?

l know they left.
They left everything--

checkbook, wallet and all.

Where can a man go
with no money, l.D. or nothing?

Maybe he has a friend
who has money.

That bunch?

They couldn't put enough
together to buy a pack of ketchup.

And l guarantee that's two dollars
more than your ass got.

Shut your ass up
before l push you.

Maybe he asked other friends
that might be able to give him money.

So he can live for a while.

Oh, that l couldn't tell you.

Ahh, yeah! There is this
one guy who lives uptown.

He'd be partying with them celebrities,
a lot of them sports stars,

and all them other assholes.

They got a lot of money--
they don't know what to do with it.

What'd they call him? Uh...

Damn!
What'd they call him?

He's a ghetto superstar.
Ghetto superstar.

How do you know this?

My nephew told me.
He around their age.

And they are friends?
No, they just talk.

But?

But when he was younger,
Brisco used to take care of him.

Will you stay your ass still--
you're makin' me nervous.

ls this them?

That's all of them.

And where does
this ghetto superstar live?

You go all the way
down Main until it ends,

you make a left,
and it's right there.

My Aunt Mabel used
to own the house next door.

Your Aunt Mabel's a ho.

You hater.

Well, thank you, gentlemen.

That's it.
Have a nice day.

What would
your old ass do with that?

l'd do some tricks.
Boy, l'd flip.

Boy-- boy, you don't know me!

You don't know me.

Not like l knew your mama.

Snitch!
Fuck you.

Fuck you!

l was saving your life.

Get my cane.

Why did l bring
this old motherfucker?

Get these
fucking directions right.

Men, we got cheese,
a bomb-ass ride.

Homie, let's stop by the club and get
some honies or something.

Hay Love, your life is in danger, and
all you can think about is the club?

Man, l said honies t--
We need to keep moving.

You right, let's just stop by the mall
get the new joints that just come out.

Man, we ain't going to no club,
we ain't picking up no ladies

and damn sure ain't going
to no motherfuckin' mall.

Hay Love, you really need to shut up.
lt's your fault we in this shit.

My fault?
Both: Hell yeah!

Man, y'all was the ones in the garage
smoking weed with him.

He didn't die from too much weed.

He died 'cause
you put a bullet in his head!

Fuck you, Pedro!
Huh?

Trying to make me sound
like Dirty Harry or somebody.

We wanted some weed,
he had the weed.

He smoked the weed,
y'all smoked the weed.

l smoked the weed,
and because l was high off the weed,

l accidentally split his wig.

But, if y'all want
to blame me, fine.

l still think, obvious,
it was the weed.

( water splashes )

l hope you don't mind,

the water looks so inviting.

Besides,
l didn't want to wake you.

lt's all good, baby.
Handle your business.

lt's your bad ass.

Well, you're pretty calm.

l mean, for a man
who has a gun pointed at his head.

You must have had something like this
happen to you at one time or another.

l've been there before.
lt ain't shit.

Well good,

'cause l love a man
who can handle his shit under pressure.

l'm glad you dig it.

l'll dig you too, shit!

You look real calm,
cool, and collective.

Extremely casual for a motherfucker
about to smoke a nigga.

You like it?

Fuck, l love it. Shit.

Well, l'm glad you like it, but...

who said anything about killing?

Why don't we just cut
through the bullshit?

l know why you're here, man.
l don't know where the homies at.

Shit.

And if l did, l wouldn't tell you shit
any motherfucking way.

So why don't you just grab
your motherfuckin' monkey

and get the fuck
out of my motherfucking house.

l don't know shit
and l wouldn't tell you shit anyway.

Why don't you just shoot me.
But do something, shit.

Power tool time.

Baby, are you sure
there's no other way?

'Cause l really hate working like this--
making a big mess and everything.

Fuck you!
And fuck you, too!

Get to drilling.

Damn, l hate these tough guys.

Well, well, well.

Somebody has outlived
their usefulness.

You don't know
what the fuck that is.

That can be my cousin's address,
you crazy psycho bitch!

Fuckin' bitch.

Well, l guess l'm gonna have
to check it out anyway.

You're not gonna tell me shit!

Baby, let him finish his nap.

( hip-hop music plays )

Whenever my peeps is near,
you need the streets clear

( flatulence )

( urinating )

Hey, what's happening?
What's up, man?

How the hell did we

l've been asking myself
that same question.

l hate to say it, but,
Hay Love was right.

The weed.

You know l was
thinking the same thing?

But to actually say
Hay Love is right out loud--

Keep that shit to yourself.
Yeah.

Hey, man, l'm hungry.

Man, l'm starving.

For real.

Where is Hay Love?

He went over there
behind that bush.

Behind what bush?
l don't see him.

Yeah, me neither.

You think something wrong?

Hay Love!

Oh shit.

Hay Love!

Wait!
Wha--wha--what?!

What the fuck is wrong, Brisco?

How did you wipe your ass?

Brisco, stop!

How?

Man, l don't think that's really
any of your business.

Homie, that's a legitimate question.

l'd like to know that myself.

Okay, that's three of us
against one. How?

l was gonna take care of it
next time we stopped.

Oh, man!
Nasty ass!

Nasty!
That's foul, homie. That's foul!

You ain't riding in the truck with us.
What do you want me to do?

You better get your ass in the back,

The surgery!

Plastic surgery?

Oh, yeah, yeah. l thought it was

Okay. Who's first?

( laughs )

Whoa, Rufus

Let me get my boy out of the tub,

Y'all go and chill.

Homeboy one of them Cajuns.

Did he just have on drawers?
Man, hell yeah, he did!

Shit!

Boy, sit your ass down.

We got company.

And you better well
damn behave, boy.

Yes, papa.

This here,
this is my boy Benny.

He got his head fucked up at one
of a them big monster truck accidents.

He ran out on the dirt track when this
motherfuckin' big monster truck,

his favorite one,
won the competition.

He ran out, slipped on the mud,

and got ran over
by one of them big ass tires.

And then, the exhaust
from the truck burned his face off.

l'm retarded.
Boy, you're not retarded.

Your head just got smashed
and your face is burnt.

But you're not retarded.
Now you shut up!

Yes, papa.

Anyway, doctor said
he got the mind of like a...

four, five year old,
some shit like that.

But he's dumber

so l think it's more like
a two or three, huh?

Now, who got the money?
Oh, yeah, here you go.

There you go.

l hope it's all there
'cause l'll kill if it ain't.

lt's-- no, it's there.

Man, the money there.
Sir, we don't want no problem.

Shut up before l pull

Panties man, like a girl?

And that goes for you,
you little señorita.

'cause if it wasn't,

l'd shoot y'all in the head

Can l see your panties?

All right, sir.
Call me Rufus, pretty eyes.

Rufus, we're just going--

Oh, no, it ain't like that.

Big shots, papa.

And he know--

Sir, l swear it ain't like that.
Big shot, huh?

This right here,

You know what?

Now, y'all sure? 'Cause

No, no, no.
We got some time on our hands.

Benny, let's go get our pretty little

Excuse me, pink panties.

Next time that motherfucker say

J-Rob, be cool.

Man, let's just drink this lemonade

Probably be easier.

Rufus:
Here's your lemonade.

Here you go right there.

There you go.

Here's to my new pretty friends.

Ooh-wee!

Boy, you sure

Okay. Hey, Rufus,

Roll up out of here.

Yeah, give him the card.

Give him the card, bro.

Oh, shit!
Wait, wait! Everybody calm down!

No, l gots to kill you.
Benny, cover your ears.

Yes, papa.

Don't look nervous now, fellas.
The hard part's done.

Let me get this straight, Doc.
You can make us look like anybody?

make you look like someone else.

Exactly like somebody else?
Come on, exactly!

Oh, damn!

Make me look like that little
faggot on Soul Train.

No, make me look like Billy D.,
the young one though.

Oh, hell, no! Denzel.
Make me look like Denzel.

Wait, wait. Hold up.

to make him look like Denzel?

A whole lot more.

No, just make us look
like somebody else.

Wait a minute. What celebrity

Spike Lee?
Never mind.

Rufus:
Go on and get your asses in there!

Are these the ones

Yes siree, Bob.

Well, l got special plans
for these two.

Ladies, take our patients in the back.
Let's get them ready.

This is what

This is the way Hay Love's

Damn!
What's up, boys?

Jay Rob?
Brisco?

Ah shit! Pedro?

What up?

Oh, look at this motherfucker.

Man, l'm about to get me

and a credit card.

Then like Superman,

But if you ever need
my services...

Thank you.

Hey, Doc,

You mean those two
that was chasing you?

Yeah.

Let's just say we made sure

of extra surgeries.

Wow.

( muffled talking )

You know these people, boss?

These are the guys

and this one being shorter,

but will never forget their faces.

Take care of them.

We get away we got plenty greens
and we life-long Henny friends

Swig cognac and see the day go by

and l'm keeping me a plastic Glock

'Cause surviving

What's up, nigga?

You caught me with your wife.

Last time l got high,

But l'm gonna tell you what...

Why you gotta bring my momma--

You said that

You know my momma's been gone?
You know my momma's been gone, no.

You know what else
