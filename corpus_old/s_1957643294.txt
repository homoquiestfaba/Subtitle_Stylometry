[Narrator] There once lived
 a gentleman from a fine family

whose hard work made
 him very, very rich.

His life was filled with beauty.

Not only was he blessed with
 a loyal and loving wife,

but a most attractive daughter.

(calm music)

Sweet, kind, she was as
 lovely inside as she was out.

Life, however, is not
 always predictable

and darkness passed
across the man's future

and his wife took gravely ill.

A few weeks later,
  she passed on.

Winter came and
 covered everything in
 a blanket of white.


And when the sun
 brought springtime,

the rich man had
 found a second wife,

who brought along
  her two daughters.

Like their mother, they had
 nasty and wicked hearts.

This did not bode well for
  the rich man's daughter.

Sometime later, the rich man
 left on a long business trip.

But you just came back.

It can't be helped, I'm sorry.

Now what might I
 bring back for you?

Well, I--

A beautiful dress,
 my wonderful husband.

And candy.

Lots of cherries covered
 with thick, creamy chocolate.

And pearls!

A long magnificent strand

to adorn my long and
 magnificent neck.

And you, my daughter?

I need nothing, Father.

I wish only that
  you return safely.

I shall.

Until then, farewell!

I miss you already, Father.

What did you say?

Nothing.

Then stop wasting time
and go do your chores!

(stepsisters laughing)

[Narrator] Blinded by
  his love for his new wife,

the father didn't see what
 was happening to his daughter.

The cruel stepsisters
 immediately took
 away her bedroom,

her fine clothes, and
  made her do all the chores

around the house while
 they had all the fun.


The father had no idea she
 was sleeping on a straw mat

in front of the fireplace.

And although the
 fire kept her warm,

the ashes and cinders
 drifted across her,

making her look dusty and dirty.

The stepsisters made fun of
 her and called her Cinderella.


(lively music)


I miss you, Mother.

(mysterious music)

Why, Cindy,
 you've been crying.

You're alive?

Would I be talking
 if I wasn't alive?

No, but...

Who are you?

I'm your fairy
 godmother, of course.

I didn't know I...

Nonsense.

Everybody has a fairy godmother.

Well, almost everybody.

You can fly!

Oh, I can do all
  sorts of things!

Watch.


But I just hung those up!

No problem.


Oh, I wish you were
 here all the time.

I am, my sweet.

And I know everything
 that's going on.

Then you know about my
 stepmother and stepsisters?

Their deeds will
  not go unpunished.

You have my word.

Now, no more tears, promise?

I promise.

Good.

Pleasant dreams, my child.

And fear no longer.

Good night to you,
 fairy godmother.


Oh, too bad Cinderella
can't play with us.

Somebody has to
  do all the chores.


Cinderella!



Now look what you've done.

You frightened me.

When you finish
 cleaning up your mess,

the floors need to be
scrubbed, the curtains cleaned,

and the silver polished.

But I just
 polished the silver.

Well, do it again!

I want to see my
 face in every spoon.

What?

What's happening?

What is going on here?


You cheated.

I did not.

Did too.

Did not.

Did too.

Did not.

You did!

Besides, it's my turn anyway!

No, it's my turn.

Move!

(tinkling music)




[Narrator] Meanwhile, the
king's son had just come of age.

And the king and queen were
anxious for the handsome prince

to choose a wife from the
 rank and nobility in the land.

Do you think he likes her?

Well, if I could
 see, I could tell you.


My father is the
  Duke of Rockingham

and he is very, very wealthy.


My grandfather was
  even wealthier.

Wealth isn't important to me.

Our collection of fine
 art is the most exceptional

in the land.

Save yours, of course.

Huh?

Quick, dear, he's coming.

Well?

Isn't she lovely?

I will not marry
 someone I don't love.

But--

I have an idea.

We will hold a grand ball

and invite all the eligible
 young ladies we can find.

Yes, a magnificent
 ball, a feast!

Surely you'll be able to
find your princess then?

I will agree
 under one condition.

Speak, my son.

The choice is
 mine and mine alone.

Agreed.

The invitation shall
 go out immediately!

(upbeat music)


(stepsisters laughing)

I got it, I got it!

It's mine!



It's here!

The invitation is here!

The king and queen request
 the pleasure of your company

at the grand ball to be
held at the royal palace

three days hence.

Oh, mother, that's wonderful!

But I need a new dress.

Me too, me too, me too!

Not to worry, my children.

You shall have
  whatever you need.


May I go to the ball?

That's hardly
 possible, Cinderella.

You certainly don't expect
 me to buy three new dresses,

do you?

Well, I just
 thought it would be...

Besides, you can't even dance.

Come, girls.

There's so much to do!

I will not cry.

I will not cry.

I will not cry.

[Stepmother] Cinderella!

(owl hooting)

[Narrator] The night
 of the ball arrived

and the kind-hearted
 Cinderella tried her utmost

to help her
 stepsisters get ready.

â™ª The time's approaching

â™ª The carriages were called

â™ª To take the young
ladies out to the ball â™ª


â™ª Oh, so pretty in satin

â™ª So pretty in lace

â™ª With ringlets of curls
around every face â™ª

â™ª It's the chance
  of a lifetime â™ª

â™ª A chance to begin anew

â™ª A chance to capture
  the heart of the prince â™ª

â™ª And make your
  dreams come true â™ª

â™ª The time is here

â™ª The carriage is called

â™ª The trumpeters herald
the start of the ball â™ª

â™ª The pretty young ladies
  are ready to dance â™ª

â™ª But no one will give
 Cinderella a chance â™ª

â™ª It's the chance
  of a lifetime â™ª

â™ª A chance to begin anew

â™ª A chance to capture
  the heart of the prince â™ª

â™ª And make your
  dreams come true â™ª

â™ª I missed my chance
 of a lifetime â™ª

â™ª I missed my
 chance for romance â™ª

â™ª All my dreams are
 turned to dust â™ª

â™ª I never had a chance

Everything ready?

Oh, please can I go?

Won't you please reconsider?

Well, she did
 help us get dressed.

Alright.

I've just emptied a bowl
  of lentils into the ashes.

Pick them out of the fireplace
 before our coach arrives

and you can go.

Oh, thank you, thank you!

How will I ever do this in time?

[Fairy Godmother]
 Not to worry, Cindy.

We'll take care of it.



Oh my goodness!


I don't suppose you've
finished, have you?

I did what you asked.

So you have.

(ominous music)


Except for that one.

But the rest are in the bowl.

I said all, not all but one.

Our coach is here.

I will not cry.

I will not cry.

I will not cry.


Come on, Cindy.

Stop it before
  you drown us both.

I know I promised
 not to cry, but...

Oh, it's alright.

I understand.

Why, even fairy godmothers
  cry once in a while.

Follow me.

Where are we going?

You, my darling Cindy,
are going to the ball.

To the ball?

But how?

Now get me a pumpkin.

A pumpkin?

Yes.

Yes, you know, a
 round orange thing.

A pumpkin.

But how will a pumpkin
get me to the ball?

Enough with all the questions.

Leave it to me.

In the meantime, get me
 four mushrooms, six lizards,

and a rat.

A what?

How strange this all is.

You haven't seen anything yet.

Now go, go!

The fun's just beginning.

Birds of a feather,
 come back together.

Scoop it clean, my
 crested companions.

I couldn't find any lizards.

Well, look in
  the watering can.

Now hurry!

I found the lizards!

Well done, Cindy.

Now place it here.

What do you want to
 do with these things?

Don't worry.

Now stand back, my darling.

The fun has just begun!


(gasps) Oh, I
  can't believe it!

But how can I go to
 such an elegant affair

in these wretched rags?

Not to worry.

It's beautiful!

But...

Yes, I know, I know.

Glass slippers?

How unusual.

Not a bad touch, if
 I do say so myself.

Come, it's time to go.

One last thing.

You must not remain at
  the ball beyond midnight.

Why not?

If you stay a moment longer,
 the charm will be broken

and everything will change
  back to its old self.

Before midnight, I promise.


What is it?

Well, (laughs) nobody's perfect.


Be gone, my Cindy.

And have the time of your life!

Remember what I told you!

Be home before the
  clock strikes 12.

I will, fairy
  godmother, I will!

(lively music)

I must say, dear, you've
  really outdone yourself.

Everyone who is anyone is here.

If this doesn't
 get our son a wife,

I don't know what will.

We have the finest orchestra
 all the way from Vienna,

the most important
  chef from Paris,

and the most beautiful
  young ladies in the land.

Alright, girls, get
 in there and get him.

You can do it, now go!


Would you honor me with
  a dance, your highness?

I understand you
 have feet like wings.

I beg your pardon?

Dance with me!

I'm so much more graceful.

You are not.

You dance like a stork.

That's a lie!

It is not.

Is too.

[Short Stepsister] Oh yeah?

Well, you're a dunce.

[Tall Stepsister] Am not.

[Short Stepsister] Are too.

[Tall Stepsister] Am not.

[Short Stepsister] Are too!

What do you suppose happened?

I've never seen anyone as--

Your face is like...

You're the most beautiful
  young lady I've ever seen.

I'm flattered.

Thank you.

May I escort you inside?

It would be my honor.


[Announcer] Ladies
 and gentlemen,
 announcing the prince!


The prince?

What a charming creature.

Charming indeed.

What grace.

What elegance.

What nerve.

And who is she anyway?

(upbeat music)

That's the gaudiest
 dress I've ever seen!

And those shoes.

Who ever heard of
  glass slippers?

He'll soon tire
 of her, you'll see.

[Narrator] But the prince
 did not tire of Cinderella.

He danced only with her for
 the rest of the evening.

So entranced was
  Cinderella with the prince

that she forgot all about her
 fairy godmother's warning.

(clock chiming)

(gasps) Oh no!

Forgive me, your
highness, but I must go.

Wait!

I don't even know your name!

Please, please let me
go before it's too late!


No!

(breathing heavily)

Did you see a lady
 come running out?

She ran into the
 maze, your highness.

But she looked more like
a peasant than a lady.

[Prince] Hello?

Oh no, no!

Hello?

Come back!


[Narrator] Afraid
 to get caught,

Cinderella left her
 glass slipper behind

and fled into the night.

(tinkling music)

How could I have
  lost you so soon?

I know he must love
 me, but I do love him.

But how will he ever find me?

â™ª Where has she
 been all my life? â™ª

â™ª I'm drawn like a
 moth to her flame â™ª

â™ª I'd make her my princess

â™ª I'd make her my wife

â™ª But I don't even
  know her name â™ª

â™ª How can I find her?

â™ª Where could she be?

â™ª Without her I
 won't be the same â™ª

â™ª Without her my heart
 will never be free â™ª

â™ª But I don't even
  know her name â™ª

â™ª He's the one I've
 been waiting for â™ª

â™ª The handsome
 prince of my dreams â™ª

â™ª I've never felt
  this way before â™ª

â™ª Afloat in a sea of moonbeams

â™ª Could this be love
 the way that I feel? â™ª

â™ª Will I ever see him again?

â™ª I have to know
  if love is real â™ª

â™ª Without him my
world will end â™ª

â™ª Where have you
 been all my life? â™ª

â™ª I've been waiting
 for someone like you â™ª

â™ª Will you be my princess,
  will you be my wife? â™ª

â™ª My darling, yes, I do

â™ª Come back, come
 back, I love you so â™ª

â™ª Save me, they're
  tearing me away â™ª

â™ª Darling, tell me your
name before you go â™ª

â™ª I can't hear you

â™ª Oh please, help me stay

â™ª Where has love
 been all my life? â™ª

â™ª Why is love
 leaving this way? â™ª

â™ª Who will console me
and kiss away my tears â™ª

â™ª When love has gone away?

â™ª When love has gone away?


(slow music)

(crowd chattering)

Hear ye, hear ye.

Let it hereby be known

that the royal prince
 requests all single ladies,

regardless of rank or stature,

to try on this
 unique glass slipper.

Furthermore, whomever
 this slipper shall fit

will become the
 bride of the prince

and be the princess of the land.

(crowd chattering)

[Narrator] The prince
traveled over hills and valleys

in search of his true love.



But alas, no one was
  found to fit the slipper.

The prince was growing
 weary of his fruitless quest

as he turned up the road
  to where Cinderella lived.

(horse neighs)

(gasps) He's here!

The prince is coming.

Cinderella, close that door
 and come here this instant.

My feet are freezing!

And mine are boiling.

Oh, stop complaining.

The idea is to get them
to fit into the slipper.

But my foot will never
shrink enough to fit.

And I don't think that
mine'll get any bigger.

They better.

Cinderella!

Dispose of these buckets.

May I try on the slipper too?


Absolutely not.

You're much too
  dirty to be seen.

As soon as you dispose
 of these buckets,

go upstairs to the attic and
 wait until I call you down.

But I...

Do as I say.

Now!


Good afternoon, your highness.

We've been expecting you.

Won't you please come inside?


If only I could
 try on that slipper,

the prince would know
 I'm the one he loves.

Isn't there anything you can do?

I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

Oh, please, hurry!

The prince won't
be here forever.

One thing you
 must learn, my dear.

Never rush a fairy godmother!


Push harder, dear.

I'm trying!

Stop, before the
  slipper shatters!

Then I shall never
  find my beloved.


Sorry, Mother.

Next?

Oh, I just adore glass!

Oh, no, no, I'm afraid
 your foot is much too small.

Perhaps if she tried again.

Don't you have
 any other daughters?

No, I...

I was told you
 had three daughters.

(laughs) Well, actually I do.

But Cinderella's
 only my stepdaughter

and surely she
 couldn't be the one.

(distant singing)

That voice!

It's her!

â™ª The handsome
 prince of my dreams â™ª

â™ª I've never felt
  this way before â™ª

Louder!

â™ª Afloat in a sea of moonbeams

â™ª Could this be love,
 the way that I feel? â™ª

I have heard that
 voice in my dreams

ever since we danced.

I'm sure it is her!

With all due
respect, your highness,

it's only Cinderella.

Bring her down here at once!

[Stepmother] But
  your highness...

At once!

Fetch her.


I pray that I am right.

You wish to see
  me, your highness?

No, please.

Be seated.

A perfect fit, my lord.

I knew it.

She was lucky!

There must be some mistake.

A mere coincidence.

It can't be Cinderella.

It is possible, my lord.

(dramatic music)


Hmm, what's this?

The other slipper.

I lost only one the
 night of the ball.

We shall see.

You are the one!

You shall be my bride.

Oh.


No, sire, she
  cannot be the one.

Why, look at those ragged
  clothes, that dirty face!

I did not fall in
love with a fancy dress.

Nor can a few simple
  ashes conceal her beauty.

It is Cinderella I love.

And I you, my prince.

[Narrator] A few days later,

the prince and
Cinderella were married.

It was a grand and
  glorious ceremony,

and Cinderella looked
  more beautiful than ever,

while the prince was happier

than he ever
 dreamed he would be.

Cinderella's father had
returned from his trip

to give away the bride,

but she never told him
  how much she had suffered.

And when her
 stepsisters apologized

for their thoughtlessness,
  Cinderella,

with a goodness
 that knew no bounds,

saw to it that they
 married two handsome lords.

Cinderella and the prince
 lived in comfort and happiness

for the rest of their lives.

And while Cinderella grew
  to be a beautiful woman,

it was her good grace
  that was far more precious

than her beauty,

and her forgiveness that
  was a jewel beyond price.

As all who hear this story know,

only true kindness is worthy
 of a fairy godmother's gift.

For without kindness,
 we can do nothing.

But with it, anything and
  everything is possible.

â™ª Lovely as a flower blooming

â™ª On the first of spring

â™ª Roses blossom to her touch

â™ª She makes the
  song birds sing â™ª

â™ª Dream on, Cinderella
