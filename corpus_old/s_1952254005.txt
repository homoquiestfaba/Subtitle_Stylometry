[birds chirping]

[somber piano music]

Hey.

Daniel.

I'm leaving.

Okay, I'll drive you to the
airport.

No, no, no, I called a cab.

I thought you said you
wanted me to drive you...

No, I changed my mind.

But didn't you say....

No.

Danny.

I want you to think about
what I said last night.

You know what I want.

[phone ringing]

Thanks, thanks, I'll be right
out.

I can't think right now.

Danny.

Hey, you know I love you.

You're going to have to think
about that sometime.

Sometime is coming up.

Happy birthday.

Oh man, hey wait.

Thanks for remembering.

Sure.

I like the new chair.

Yeah, it's good.

It's much more visual than
the last one.

Think so?

Yeah.

Not very
comfortable though.

Yeah, visually it didn't work with
the cushions.

Looks great, sucks to sit on.

I'm representing the firm
for the Athens job,

Charlie told me that I might have to meet
with Bob at the architectural site,

they need expertise on the
architectural structural system

so I might be a little
longer than usual.

If I go to Sydney I'll give
you a call okay?

Let you know when
I'm coming back.

Wait.

We'll talk when I
get back, okay?

But Rusty I'm really, really
tired of living in a hotel.

It's the Tropical!

Janice Joplin died here;
it's like the hottest hotel in Hollywood.

Yes, but I want something
more permanent.

Say hi to Bob for me.

Yeah.

This one is May 1936.

Well that's good,
but not good enough.

Has to be 1935
and July please.

I've got it, June 1935.

June?

June's good, I
could approve June.

It's a month before
the house was finished.

Let's see.

Color is good!

Design is good,
texture is good...

uh, oh, what's this?

What?

Do you see it?

Look, there's a crack.

Yes!

Fuck!

Keep looking.

You can't even see it!

Garret it has to
be perfect, okay,

you can't put your name on
something unless it's absolutely

perfect, we just have to
keep looking that's all.

Rusty I need a minute.

Sorry, still looking.

Rusty, we'll find a sink okay,
can we have a minute please?

How are we supposed to
find a sink if we're talking?

This is serious.

I got a call from the
Howell's last night.

What?

They're not upset
about the house I hope.

The house is perfect, they can
not be upset about the house.

They love your work.

Okay.

And that's the thing, they
want you to design a house

for their daughter.

Did they find another
Frank Lloyd Wright to restore?

No, they want you to design this
one from the ground up and I

told them it's the chance
you've been waiting for.

They're nightmare
clients, nightmare clients.

I thought I was going to have a
nervous breakdown in the last

house I did for them.

You think you're going to have
a nervous breakdown on every

project we do.

What about the noitra, I mean
I've spent three years of my

life on this project.

You said I should put my
whole life into this project.

Rusty listen to me, I think that
we need to get you moving past

the (inaudible)
restorations, okay,

I mean people are starting to
think that that's all you do.

I got a call from a Russian
magazine last week

about your last restoration.

Magazine, Russia?

Yeah, Russia and I think
they want to do an interview.

Russian magazine?

Rusty I don't think
it's a good idea,

I think it will only perpetuate
the whole restoration thing and

not showcase your
design work.

Should I do an
interview in the magazine?

Rusty the point is even people
in Siberia only think that you

do restorations, okay.

I mean you need to break
out, make some other kind of

statement, move
towards your own creativity.

I don't want to
make a new statement,

I like this statement, I want
to make this statement over

and over again.

I'm about refinement,
I'm a perfectionist,

I've looked at 200
sinks for this job alone!

The house is for
their daughter, okay.

It's her wedding present.

I mean it's on a mountain
top in the desert!

You're going to build a
house from the ground up,

I want you to be creative okay!

And, and, and you're talking to the
Howell's this afternoon, for us!

So you had this
planned all along?

Yeah, you're damn right I did
buddy because I'm the master

planner and you're the
master designer and,

and, you're the
greatest partner in the world,

I just want you to
fuckingg grow.

I don't want to grow.

Well you're going to
grow starting right now.

You know this is in
your best interest!

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

You're such a
fuckingg bastard.

You're an asshole.

You're what?

I'm assigning Rusty
to a new project.

But Rusty is doing my house.

Yes, and it's almost finished.

I'm taking over, I'm going
to handle all the details.

ls this your idea Rusty?

This is my idea actually.

Rusty is going to be designing
a house from the ground up.

He's moving past restorations.

What restorations?

I spent five million
dollars on this property,

now it's just a restoration?

I didn't say that, l
didn't say anything like that.

We spent every weekend looking
for vintage plumbing Rusty.

We even flew to the
Philippines to look at veneers.

And now you're just
dumping me for some new project.

I didn't dump you guys.

I'll be taking over the completion
aspect of the project.

ls this what you want Rusty?

Well I mean he is the boss.

I'm not the boss, I'm Rusty's
business partner and the house

is almost complete
and Rusty is moving on.

Like hell he is!

I'm calling my
lawyers right now,

I'll see both of you in court.

I thought that went well.

Good, good...

Well, we're going
to the Howell's now,

so we'll get back.

So tell Rusty about the site.

Yes, um, we called Garrett
to see if we could get you to

design a house for our
daughter on some land

we have up in Mullholland.

Yeah, well of course l
would have to see the property,

you know feel it out,
get an idea of the land.

Mother bought it years ago,
I haven't done much with it.

lt's about ten acres.

Ten acres, my God
on Mulholland.

More or less.

lt's some pretty spectacular
views if I say so myself.

Mr. Price, well Rusty,
if I can call you Rusty.

Oh, of course, I think I spent
about two years trying to get

you to call me
Rusty, Mrs. Howell.

Elaine.

Elaine.

The thing is Rusty that we're
so pleased with what you did,

we just wanted to give the
same pleasure to Brookie.

Uh huh.

You see Rusty what she
means-- what we mean is well,

turns out there's this
Gio Ponti up in the hills.

lt's unpublished and it's
unknown as well as untouched

and has been perfectly maintained
by the original builders.

Heard about it this
morning when I was playing golf.

And, um, well Rusty, we traded.

About 15 minutes before
you got here.

You would love it Rusty.

lt's got all the original furniture
that was built for the house.

lt was built by Venezuelan
copper magnet for his wife in

1955, she wanted to
be a film actress.

So you guys aren't
actually building anything?

That's right my boy,
we're giving her the Ponti.

The Gio Ponti.

We just went right ahead and
did the deed over martinis.

Beautiful, perfect.

That's great.

Our Two Architects.

Yeah.

Okay.

Okay, I'll call you later.

Rusty!

Look, I'm really
sorry, okay I didn't know.

I didn't know!

I mean, who trades
properties, right?

l've got some more news.

Being sued over the noitra.

Just got a call
from our lawyers.

Look Rusty, I'm
really sorry, l, l...

I didn't know!

Excuse me, do you have anything
stronger here than beer?

We have wine in
the case over there.

Could you help me find
it, I didn't see it.

You know why don't
you keep looking,

we're open all day.

Hey!

Would you get the man
his wine!

Do you want some wine?

Actually I want a dry martini, but
I don't think he'll get it for me.

Let me show you the
wine, it's over here.

Give me the keys.

What?

The keys, give me the keys.

Where am I going to sit!?

A taxi.

Nice.

I'm Denny.

I know you from somewhere.

Where?

You're a porn star aren't you?

I knew it when you
walked in and I thought,

that's what I want.

Aporn star.

I knew I wanted you
when I first saw you.

I'm positive.

Yeah?

I'm not worried though.

I'm going to cure it.

I'm going to find a way.

I'm going to create a system, my body
is going to metamorphis AlDS away.

Fuck me.

I want you to fuck me.

I have to get a condom.

I have some.

Can I stay with you
for a couple of days?

Hey.

Hey handsome.

You're awake.

Hey are you part Asian?

Pure English.

You look kind of
Asian when you're asleep.

You're watching me sleep?

Yeah, first time I made it
was with a Hawaiian guy.

I'm starving, let's
order some room service.

They don't have room
service at the Chopper,

but we have to go
to the coffee shop.

Hmm.

So let's go to the coffee shop.

Nobody's watching.

What are you looking at?

You.

Well, what do you see?

I don't think you're
too sure of yourself.

And you think too much
too, it gets in your way.

That's pretty sharp.

I can go on.

I really, really had a
great time last night.

Yeah, you were really fun.

You made me feel
like somebody else.

Well maybe you just felt like
yourself for the first time.

I really like you Rusty.

So what are you doing
for the rest of the day?

Any big plans?

Thought I would just
hang out with you.

Would you put some
lotion on my back,

I can't reach it.

You know you should
moisturize twice a day,

it's good for your skin.

You're the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time,

you know that?

I need a hundred bucks.

Expensive cigarettes.

I need some crystal.

I need it for the pain.

I don't think so.

Hey, a lot of fucked up
shit has happened to me,

and I don't mean this as a put
down but you haven't got a clue

of some of the shit
l've been through,

you just don't fuckingg know.

Let's just think about it later.

I was in some videos Rusty.

We can rent one of them when we
get my crystal and you can fuck

me and watch me being
fucked on TVat the same time.

How's that sound?

Porn star.

Where you going?

I'll be right back.

I'll go with you.

No, stay here,
I'll be right back.

Hey.

Hey, you going to be around?

What time should I come by?

Okay, I want a
hundred bucks worth.

I know, I know!

Listen I'll suck
your cock, relax.

I know I owe you!

No way man!

No, you've got to
give me a break!

Okay, okay, two hundred bucks.

You're still going to
give me a bag right?

Yeah, and the blow job.

Listen, take a
fuckingg bath will you?

Wow, look at this.

I was going to come get
you when I was ready.

Wow, this looks great.

What is it a martini
from a can?

And that's not all.

After that you're
going to fuck me.

Well that sounds great too.

But first, you're going
to go to your wallet

and take out a couple
hundred bucks.

And then....

And then?

And then we're going
to go get my crystal.

Uh huh.

And then we just
fuck and fuck and fuck.

Denny, there's no way I'm going to
give you money to buy crystal.

There's no way.

I think way too much of you now
to just let you kill yourself.

You told me you have AlDS, can't
be good for you to smoke crack

when you have AlDS.

Crystal has
nothing to do with AlDS,

okay, there's no connection,
nobody's proved anything.

Denny, you're killing yourself.

So you're not going
to give me the money?

lt's not about money.

So give it to me then.

Not for you to buy drugs.

Fuck you man.

Hey.

Hey.

So I just came from
the lawyers'office.

Oh great.

What is going on?

Huh, I mean are
we still partners?

Youi hungry?

Meat, uck!

My girlfriend would have a fit.

We're on this yogurt diet thing
and she wants me to clean my

intestines with her.

Ahhh, but think what this
meat will do to your intestines?

Yeah, give it to me!

So Denny, huh.

What's going on with that?

I think I'm in love with him.

I want to hold him forever and
God he just needs somebody to

help him.

That's what you
said about the noitra.

That was a wreck!

Yeah, first look, couldn't
wait to get your hands on it.

Right, because it needed me.

Yeah.

So why did he run away?

Denny.

Denny.

His name is Denny.

Yeah, I know, why
did Denny run away?

Just now?

He was mad because I wouldn't
give him money for crystal meth.

Jesus.

And do I like him when I don't
give him money for it or when l

do give him money for it?

I mean I'm not his parent right?

Should I just use him and fuck
him like everybody else does?

He's not a house Rusty.

You can't restore him.

I just really like the way
I feel when I'm with him.

Yeah, I can imagine.

I mean seriously, it's like the
first time in my life I'm not

thinking about chairs or
noitras or rights or houses,

I can just like be in
the moment with him.

[lawnmower running]

[door closing]

Rusty look, I apologize
for getting pissed.

Accepted.

Come on have some of the
breakfast you brought.

I'm not all that hungry now.

Oh, come on sit down.

This is my friend Garrett.

Garrett.

Denny, right?

He's my partner.

Business partners.

I want to make
Rusty my partner too,

not for business
though, for pleasure.

Hmm.

Yeah, Rusty's a good guy.

I don't know that
many good guys.

Okay, well, you two have
something to talk about.

Yeah, I'll see you in court.

You don't have to go.

I'll work on that.

Oh, he's straight.

Straight?

I know a lot of straight
guys that like to fool around.

Come on stay.

Oh, well, you know
not this one, okay.

I have to wash my hands.

So tempting,
really, but the hands.

I'm sure.

She can smell meat
on me for miles.

Rusty...

I'm sorry I freaked!

I really like you.

I can't buy you crack.

Crystal.

Whatever.

Nobody's proved anything.

Look, it's a
homemade drug right?

And AlDS weakens the immune system
and crystal goes after your

kidneys and God
knows what else.

lt makes me stronger,
it's like medicine.

Have you ever even tried it!

lt can't be good for
you in your situation.

But you don't know,
you've never tried it.

There's nothing you're going
to say that's going to make me

think it's good for you.

I'm telling you, it
makes me stronger.

I'll go to a doctor and
he'll say the same thing I will.

Doctors -- doctors
don't know shit!

I care too much about you to
let you do this to yourself....

You don't care, if you
cared you'd help me!

He really likes you, you know.

He likes fuckingg me.

No, he likes you a
little bit more than that.

I don't really see
it, but you know.

[door slamming]


I'm sorry I made you mad.

I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

This would be the last time.

I can't help you.

This makes me feel so sexy.

I want to be sexy for you man, l
want you to fuck me all night.

I can do that
without crystal.

No, it makes it easier for me
to take your big cock.

You can fuck me for hours
and hours, come on.

Come on.

I don't have any cash.

There's an ATM in the lobby.

Come on porn star, l
want you up my ass so bad.

Come on.

Wait here.

Hey.

I got the money.

l've got to get the
shit from my guy,

he's making
another batch right now.

You've been a bad boy
though haven't you.

You owe Roger some money.

But l've got the money,
l've got all the money.

What about the
interest you owe me?

lnterest?

You want the shit?

Yeah.

You need to take
your clothes off.

Fuck you.

Fuck you.

Close the door.

Good boy.

Go on.

That a boy.

Stay there.

Let me look at you.

Get over here on
your knees.

Get on your knees.

You're going to
suck my dick.

Finally.

He has to go get the stuff.

Oh, so we have to wait longer!

Come on let's go.

We're just, all I'm
thinking about is cops.

You know you need drugs.

Just think about us
going out tonight.

I will be super
horny and ready to play.

Just think about touching me
and coming in me over and over.

[door closing]

You want a smoke baby.

No, I'm going to
take a shower though,

I feel kind of dirty.

Do me a favor.

Close the blinds.

No, I need them to see.

But I like it
dark when I'm high.

Yeah, are you going to
be ready to go out?

Yeah.

Just...one...hit.


Okay, this belt with that
outfit would be so cool.

I love this club.

lt's going to be so fun.

You look sexy.

I am sexy.

Yeah, you are fucking sexy.

Don't leave me.

I'm so fucking scared,
just don't leave me okay.

Promise me you
won't leave me.

Hey, hey don't worry, hey.

Don't worry.

Worry about what?

I never did this before.

You're with me now.

No, these are great.

Excellent.

We've got to get one
thing straight, okay.

I do what I want to do.

I'm really into you
Rusty and I like you a lot,

but I don't belong to you.

I thought we were going
to be together tonight?

We are, but that doesn't mean
that I can't do what I want.

Doesn't mean that l
don't like you more.

Come on you don't see me kissing
some other guy that I don't know.

Look, I might be yours,
but you don't own me.

Got that?


Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

You are such a
bastard you know that!

Yeah l've been
called that before.

I'm sure of that.

Come on, going out with somebody
doesn't mean anything.

You're the one that I like.

You're the one that
I want to be with.

Yeah, right.

lt's true.

You two are so sexy!

God, it is hot in there!

I'm getting married!


Hey, so are we!

You have to use my bridesmaids,
if we can find them!

Well, let's go find
your bridesmaids!

We're going to go
find the bridesmaids.

Let's go.

Boy are you hot,
you got any drugs?

lt is truly hot in there.

Yeah.

Yeah I don't really
like clubs anyway.

Aren't you Russell Price?

You know I saw a lecture on the
Elwood renovation you did two

years ago at the
Phoenix Art Museum.

I work at a firm in Phoenix.

Yeah, I remember that.

Yeah.

Did you ask a lot of
questions at that one?

A lot of people asked questions.

You remember me?

No, I didn't ask any questions
but I remembered your work,

I loved it, I thought the
house looked better after your

restoration, honestly.

Everybody says that and I keep
telling people that the building

materials now are so much
better than they were then,

you really can't make....

lt's a complement, but
you did a fantastic job.

Oh, okay, thank you.

I was really impressed.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Hey.

Who the hell is this?

Hey go get the car, we're
going to go to a party

with the bridesmaids.

Yeah,just a second.

No, now!

Sexy come on, come on,
let's go,

we're going to party
with the bridesmaids.

Let's go!


What's it like being gay?

lt's cool.

You know I'm kind of
in love with Daphne.

I fantasize about
having sex with her.

Well do it!

I'm getting married silly!

Hello...?

Why aren't you
out there with him?

I don't smoke.

You ever been with a woman?

No.

Do you want to?

Uh, nope.

Grosses me out.

Too bad.

Cause you're hot.



Hot.

Twenty bucks if I can watch.

Twenty-five, thirty!

[door slamming]

Why were you looking at me?

Why were you looking at me?

She asked why I'm with you.

Well that's an
interesting question.

He said because you were kind.

Rusty is kind.

He really likes me.

He wants to take care of me.

I never really met
anyone like him before.

What's the matter
baby, you want to go home.

Ah, let's go home.

We're going to go.

All right.

I want to be with you.

Please keep me with you.

Don't let me go.

Want a hit baby?

Sure you don't want to try?


''Hush now baby''


''I see you dancing...''

''...in the moonlight''


''Hush now baby,''

''I see you dancing...''

''in the moonight...''

''Hush now baby,''

''I'm in love with you''

''Hush now baby,''

''I see you dancing''

''Hush now,''

Rusty?

Hey Roger.

Hey, it's Denny.

Listen I'm coming over, I want a
couple hundred dollars worth, okay?

Yeah.

No, no, no blow
jobs this time,

l've got the money
cash man, all cash.

Fuck you man!

You don't want cash!

Well, maybe Antonio
does, maybe I'll call him.

Sure.

Yeah, a couple of rocks.

Maybe we'll do the
blowjob thing next time okay.

All right, I'll see you
in a little bit.

Bye.

[door slamming]

Rusty?

Um, who are you?

I'm with Rusty.

Where is he?

I don't know.

Asleep.

Who are you?

And what are you doing here?

Rusty loves me.

Rusty loves you?

Rusty loves you?

What the fuck is this?

[door slamming]

Wait, wait, wait...hold on.

I love you.

Hey.

Sorry I never said
it to you before.

Awe, I don't have to
say it back though do l?

As long as you kiss me.

Huh, huh.

Love you, kiss you, l
love you too buddy.

Let's go.

Can't remember the
last time I did this.

Yeah.

lt's nice to get
out of the office.

We're going to be
late for our movie.

There's a meteor shower tonight,

maybe we should just
do that instead.

I don't think we can actually see
any stars through the weeds here.

We have to drive to the desert
for any kind of visibility.

Hey, where's the crack whore?

He's not a thing.

Okay, where's Denny?

He is in a drug den
of his own making.

Oh.

Hear from the lawyers?

Yeah, I got a bill already.

You know I thought you were
pushing me out of the way so you

could take credit.

I was.

Asshole.

You were getting too big.

Well that is over with.

Yeah, be careful
what you wish for huh?

Denny?

Denny!

Okay well, l've been a
little distant I know.

I'm going to make up for it.

So what's up?

Just thinking.

About me?

Well, yeah, actually.

I mean you're a
really good looking guy.

You know a blond muscular guy
doesn't exactly have a hard time

in this town.

Who are you?

lt's kind of a big question
for breakfast don't you think?

I just-- I want to
know, how did you get here?

I mean you're a beautiful
guy and you pick me up in a

convenience store?

You don't have anybody?

lt's a little hard to believe.

What happened?

I don't think so, okay?

lf this is going to work out
between us then I have to know.

Honest.

I don't even know where to start.

From the beginning.

The beginning.

I don't even know where that is.

Start somewhere.

Well l've always
been an athlete.

So I got into football.

Well you look like an athlete.

I was good.

Fast.

Fastest white boy you ever saw.

lt got me out of a bad life.

You know bad neighborhood.

See my neighborhood
you had to fight,

you had to be a
tough mother fucker.

So I learned early on
that I had to be tough.

So I got into
boxing, into football,

and football got me a
scholarship to college.

Until then I had never
really been out of the 'hood.

Then I met these guys, you know
back in the 'hood I could never

tell anyone that I liked guys
or they'd of fuckingg killed me.

I met these guys one
night at a club in LA.

They treated me
like a fucking prince.

You know what that felt like,
to be treated so fucking special

after the way I grew up.

lt felt so fucking good.

Those guys wanted me, they
fucking wanted me and I fucking

loved it.

So what was a guy like me to do?

So I quit school and I moved in with
one of the guys I met that night.

Really nice guy,
little older, rich,

and he took care of me.

Took care of me for awhile.

Then he moved on.

Yeah, found another
kid to take care of.

And I was over it too at that point.

I was...

....but I couldn't go
back to school at that point, yeah...

...lost my scholarship.

School seemed kind of
stupid anyway if I couldn't play

football, I mean what
was the point really?

But I had my body.

By then I knew how to use it.

And that's when l
met the video guy.

He's the one that got
you started with crystal.

That's when the jokes
got pretty bad, yeah.

You see...

...he liked me to do
a lot of guys,

you know cause
that was his thing,

lots and lots of guys.

So he'd get me high.

And it just made it
that much easier.

Just made it easier.

Then one day I woke up kind of
in a haze but I could hear him

on the phone selling
me to this pimp...

like a piece of fucking cattle.

That was it for me.

I packed my bags and I got out.

And I have been on the
streets pretty much ever since.

Yeah, every now and
again I meet a guy I like,

but you know it's hard to...

What do you get out
of hearing this man?

I feel like I'm selling
my soul or something.

Don't!

Just don't!

God you are so
fucking full of shit,

just like everybody else making me
feel bad telling you all this shit.

Denny I love you....

You don't love me!

You don't fucking know man!

Look at you!

You've got money,
you've got friends,

you've probably got a boyfriend
to go back to once I'm gone.

You're just fucking using me and
you don't even fucking know me.

I'm trying to...

Fuck you, fuck you!

I'm sorry Rusty.

And I'm really sorry Denny.

lt's just not working out.

I don't think it's
going to work out.

So do you need a ride someplace?

No, I'll just get a taxi.

No, I'll give you a ride.

[birds singing]

Can you take me
to Echo Park?

[dog barking]

So Echo Park,
where now?

Where do you want
me to drop you?

I guess this is okay then.

I don't really want to go.

I never felt like this before.

I'm so confused right now.

Can't we just wait a little?

Come on.

I don't want you to go.


[humming happy birthday]

Hey so, uh, you know l'd
sing happy birthday,

but I don't really sing,

so you know
happy birthday.

Thank you.

I'm not going to eat it
either, it's too many carbs.

That's, you know, that
one is from yours truly

and it's not a book.

Come on sit down.

On that?

Yeah, sit, try it out.

Try it!

Really?

Try it!

Oh, hey, wow, that's
fun it's -- yeah- happy?

Well this one is from Daniel, so
why don't you open it up and see

what he got you.

Go on kiddo.

Okay, I would just
rip that right off,

you know...but.....

What is it?

Wow!

Wow that is really neat.

Yeah, he's really--
this is really neat.

And look he noticed how
into chairs you are.

He's a really great guy Rusty.

Definitely seeing him
in a much different way.

He really likes me doesn't he?

Yeah, yeah, I don't
know what he sees in you,

but he sure does!

God, I love it.

Let me see it.

No.

Come on, let me see
it, let me see it.

You'll hurt it!

I'm not going to
hurt it, give it to me.

Careful.

What am I going
to do sit on it?

Come on.

Careful!

Gimme.

That's cool.

So I am quitting.

You're quitting,
you're quitting what?

You're quitting love?

The chair
hunt- for comfort,

because I mean....

Our Two Architects,
I'm quitting.

What?

And you can have
all the restorations,

it's yours.

Are you out of your mind?

What do you think
you're going to do?

I made a few phone
calls today.

Going to help out with
some design projects,

couple free lance jobs.

I got a lead on an interior.

You're going to go
out on your own?

Yeah, I want to be creative.

Well that's cool,
I mean, you know.

Yeah!

Happy birthday.

Thanks.

Two chairs.

Yeah, one for me
and one for you.

That's really nice.

lt's not quite homey yet.

Well, I don't think you have
homey in your genes Rusty.

Come on, I just got
the concept recently.

I'm still learning.

You and your little buddy?

Well, nobody's ever really
called me little before,

I mean I lost a little
weight, but I think it's stress.

I meant your drug friend.

I don't get it.

Guess I don't have to.

Right?

Well he got me confused.

I didn't mean him I meant me, how
I don't mean anything to you.

Sorry, I didn't want to
bother you with any of this,

I just didn't want to leave
things hanging, so...

I deserve better.

Yeah.

You do.

You deserve better.

I'm going to go move in
with some guys from the firm.

Huh.

I'll call you later.

lt shouldn't take me
long to get my stuff.

Hello.

What the fuck's wrong with you?

I'm fucked up.

Yeah.

Go and get him.

I don't want to make him do
something he doesn't want to do.

Uh, he's hurt Rusty and
newsflash he's hurt because he

likes you, he loves you.

For Christ sakes,
don't you love him?

Hold that, I'm not giving it.


Wait Daniel, don't go,
don't go, please!

I want you to stay.

I love you.

I love you.

Too late Rusty, l
don't think you care,

I don't think you can care.

I can!

I do care!

Come on, I don't want you to go.

Well I'm not sure
that I want to stay.

I want you to stay.

That's not enough.

I want you to want
to stay then.

Say that again.

I want you to want
to stay with me.

Come on, come back
inside, come on don't go.

Come on.

I don't think I'm right for you.

You're wrong, you
are right for me.

You're perfect the way you
are, you don't need fixing up.

Yeah, but why now?

Huh?

Rusty you've been pushing me
away for so long that I'm not

going to go back to
the way things were.

Because I'm
learning what love is.

I know that I liked houses
because they can't reject me,

and I know that
sex isn't love

but it can be a
handy substitute.

And I know that love isn't love
unless it's returned to you and

I know that you love me.

And I love you.

That's why l
don't want you to go.

Come on.

Come on, come back
inside, come on.

Come on, you don't
really want to go do you?

ls this too corny
cause I kind of like it?

I love it.

You want to go back
to my place?

Yeah.

I'm starting to like
the tropical too.

Really?

No.


Good.

Good?

I just made a deal with
Mr. Howell over a martini.

lf I design a pool
house for his daughter,

I get a quarter acre
off of Mulholland.

A house?

For us.

So this is like a
lesbian moment right?

Definitely,
right, get the U-Haul.

So you want to get married?

Well, okay.

lf that's how you feel.

This is how I feel.

Where do you want to do it?

I don't know.

Wherever it's legal this week.

I'll look into it.

I'm not sure.

Just as long as it's this week.

No more premarital sex.

Yeah, I don't
know about that one.

Good.

I love you.


Hush now.....

Hush now...
