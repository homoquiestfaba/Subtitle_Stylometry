[ Grunts ]

OK.

Let's do it!

Are you there?

[ Clanging ]

[ Thunder ]

[ Loud thunderclap ]

Show yourself, please!

[ Crashing ]

This can't go on!

I've waited way too long
to face you!

This should have been settled
a long time ago!

Please! Let's end this!

I'm willing to do anything!

[ Thunderclap ]

There must be a way!

No!

N-no!

NO!

[ Screaming ]

Oh, I can't do this.

Do what?

This! Just being here!

I feel so vulnerable.

Where's George?

I don't know, but he better
be dead or dying somewhere.

I can't believe he's not here!

It's early!
He'll make it, don't worry.

In the meantime, relax!
They're gonna love you!

I don't want them to love me.

I want them
to love my paintings.

OK, Nick, you need to get over

this whole
tortured artist thing.

I mean, look at me!
You don't see me

worried about what the critics
write about my plays.

Because you haven't had
any produced yet, Margie.

Minor detail!
The point is,

I don't write for the
critics, I write for myself.

So if they hated your plays,

you'd just be content
and keep writing them?

Yeah, of course I would!

That is such a lie.

Two things you need

more than anyone else
I know are love and money.

Hmm.

Here she is!

The star of the evening,
Nicky Wickersham.

Although after tonight,
she'll be known only as Nicky.

Oh! Well,

you're assuming
that I'll survive the night.

It's first-show jitters.

Nicky, you know Darren Peters?

One of Boston's most
important art critics.

How do you do?

The... oh, sorry.
This is my friend,

Margie Mancuso.

It's a pleasure.

Pleasure's all mine.

I understand the first
axiom of an art show

is "never ask
a critic what he thinks."

Well, I think that...

Celia has unearthed,
shall I say, another...

marketable jewel.

Well, let's just hope

the market goes
bullish on jewels.

[ Chuckling ]

Well, we'll know early Monday,

when Darren's review
hits the stands!

Oh, I don't think
you'll have to wait that long.

Would you ladies excuse me?

Yeah.

He hates me.

What are you talking about?

He was eyeballing you

like you were
the only porterhouse

at a tofu picnic!

Tell her, Celia.

Would you try to look
as if you want to be here?

Believe it or not, people
don't want to buy paintings

off an artist who can't
look at her own work!

I love my work.

Well, tell them, not me!

What does that mean?

I... I think
what she's saying

is the only difference between
an artist and a prostitute

is what they're selling.

And I'm not selling?

Name your price!

Damn the critics!

You're late.

The market dropped
200 points at closing.

We were losing a fortune!

Steven didn't want me to leave,

but I told him I had
more pressing business

than, you know, half
a million investors.

Well, those are the instincts

that make you a good
investment broker.

Hmm!

Now you, go work the room!

Huh? Get out there.

[ Grunts ]

[ Chuckles ]

A toast...

To the most beautiful
woman in all of Boston,

and the man lucky enough

to be her husband for 365 days.

Mmm, 361. Our
anniversary is next week.

Ah...

Oh!

I was saving this

till next week, but...

Seeing you work
that room tonight...

Happy anniversary.

George!

Oh, go on, open it.

OK.

[ Chuckling ]

It's a brooch!

You don't like it.


I mean, honestly,

it's like nothing
I've ever seen before!

Oh, come on, Nicky!

That's just a nice way
of saying that you hate it!

No, George!
It's... I just...

I didn't expect for you
to buy me a brooch.

I didn't!
Well, buy it.

It's... it's a family heirloom.

It's been passed down
for almost 200 years,

and judging by your reaction,

that tradition is
soon to be eradicated!

Ouch!

No, I love it,

and I think that
it is very beautiful.

OK, now you're just
lying out of guilt.

I love it.

And I'm gonna prove it to you.

Well, how are you gonna do that?

Mmm!

Like this.

[ Chuckling ]

Oh!

[ Laughing ]

Good morning!

Great morning!


What got into you last night?

[ Chuckling ]

You. And a bottle
of champagne.

Oh. Well...

I have to get you
drunk more often!

Don't count on it!

Once a year is
good enough for me.

Hey!

Didn't anyone ever
tell you that it's rude

to run out on a girl
first thing in the morning

after she worked as hard
as I did last night?

I have to get to work early.

Our big hitters took a bath,

and Steven is gonna
be all over me

to get it back by
the end of the day.

He puts too much
pressure on you.

Well, it's called
responsibility.

And I like it.

Hmm.

[ Sighs ]

[ Sighs ]

I...

[ Groans ]

Don't mess with my head, Celia.

Was it good or bad?

It was good!

And bad.

[ Sighs ]

They didn't like it.

Oh, relax, Nicky.

It was a good first show.

You impressed all
the right people,

but there were
just some concerns

about your staying power.

So are you saying

that the critics didn't...

No, no, certainly not.

Oh no, Dylan.
That's too high.

Bring it down,
so we can light the corners.

Anyway, I think it's fair to say

that the critics were bemused.

[ Scoffs ]

Bemused?

Yeah, well, they don't
know what to make of you!

They can see your talent, but
they question your commitment.

[ Sighs ]

It's all about
ego and reputation.

Everyone wants to find
the next big thing,

but no one wants to risk
their reputation finding it.

And you didn't help matters

with your introverted
behaviour last night.

I'm just really uncomfortable

talking about my art!

I don't want you to talk
about your art with the critics!

Talk about sex,
drugs, rock 'n' roll.

Show them your passion,

and they will
talk about your art.

Remember something.

Critics survive by destroying

more careers than they create.

Go away,

and paint something that
grabs you by the throat.

Or the crotch.
I don't care.

Your next show is much more
important than your last one.

It always is!

My next show?

Of course.

I'm gonna make you famous

no matter how much
you fight it. Now go!

Hey!

What are you
doing home so early?

What happened?

My, um...

My father died.

Oh no!

[ Sighs ]

They, um...

They don't know what happened.

Some kind of accident
on the island.

[ Sighs ]

I know I wasn't very
close with him lately,

but I didn't expect to...

Oh, baby.

This is so beautiful up here!

I mean, it's...
it's breathtaking!

It's inspiring.

It's all right.

George!

I understand how you
feel about the house,

but you can't hold the whole
state of Maine responsible!

Well, maybe not the whole state.

[ Nicky chuckles ]

I should paint up here.

OK, now don't get any ideas.

We're up here to bury my father,

put the house up for sale,

and then get back to
Boston by next Monday.

Oh, look at this place!

And you grew up here.

Well, I went to school out here.

I, uh...
grew up out there.

So that's it, then?
That's your father's island?

That's it.

Wickersham Island.

Forty acres of nothing with
a house in the middle of it.

So how do we get out there?

It's no different
than the big city.

We take a taxi.

I didn't know you could
handle a boat like that!

Yeah, well, it's all
part of the mystery

that is Wickersham Island.

It's kind of sexy.

Yeah?

[ Chuckles ]

What's wrong?

Just creeps me out.

What does?

The house.

You know, there are
people in Shoal Harbour

that actually
believe it's haunted.

Oh my gosh.

Look at this place!

George!

It's fantastic!

When was it built?

Uh, I think it was 1840.

By my, uh...

great-great-

great-great-grandfather,

Jebidiah Wickersham.

I'm sorry.

You're the descendant

of a Jebidiah, and
you never told me?

In most metropolitan cities,

that could be
cause for annulment.

Uh... yeah, well,
I was kind of really hoping

that we could name
our first-born son, um...

Jebidiah.

No? 'Cause I'm
totally kidding.

Seriously, even as
a joke, that is disturbing.

I'm just trying
to lighten it up.

I know.

[ Footsteps ]

Did you hear that?

[ Footsteps ]

Sounds like footsteps.

Why would there...

Sorry. Didn't mean
to frighten you.

Who are you?

Peter Hughes.
Caretaker. You George?

Yes, I am.

Your dad hired me a while ago
to keep an eye on the place.

I live in the
servants' quarters.

He didn't tell me
anything about you.

Well, he didn't tell me
anything about you either.

I was the one
who found him, you know.

Over there.

By the window.

[ Clearing throat ]

How is that possible?
It's easier than you think!

He was getting on in years.

He gets on that stool
to fix something...

a broken curtain hook!

And he reaches up,

maybe a little too far!

He loses his balance.
He gets tangled in the cord.

It could all happen

in a matter of seconds.

There aren't any
broken hooks up there.

I'm not saying I know
exactly how it happened.

Oh!
The point is,

George, your father died
in a tragic accident.

What if it wasn't an accident?

You saying he was murdered?

Makes more sense, doesn't it?

Who would wanna kill
your father, George?

What about that...
that caretaker?

Peter?
He's a good kid.

Your father thought
the world of him!

He was always
in trouble, no parents.

The kid was on
a fast train to nowhere

until George
straightened him out!

He was devoted to your father.

What if it was someone
that followed him out here,

but that he didn't know?

Someone coming
out to rob him, or...

That's right. They could
still be on the island.

Have you searched it?

I'm sure down there in Boston,

you got all kinds
of motives you could find

for any accident
you stumble across.

But up here, when
we hear the sound of hooves,

we don't exactly
go looking for zebras.

Yeah, well, apparently you
don't look for answers either.

George!

You're upset.

You've been away a long time.

We went over every
square inch of this island,

and of course, this house.

There was no evidence
whatsoever of foul play.

It is what it appears
to be, George.

A tragic accident.

I personally prefer

that scenario
to the alternative one,

which is suicide.

Thanks for the coffee, ma'am.

Hi!

Is this the servants'
quarters, where Peter stays?

Stayed.

I'm telling him he's out of here
when he gets back from town.

OK.

So you were raised
with servants, huh?

[ Chuckles ]

No. The old
Wickershams had servants,

before the market
crashed in 1929.

Were they really rich?

Filthy.

This place was actually built
to be their summer house.

After the crash, they lost
everything but this place,

so the family moved
out here permanently.

Shortly after that,
my great-grandfather,

the first George Wickersham...

He died out here.

So have all the Wickersham men.

[ Thunderclap ]

Grandpa Jebidiah?

The grand patriarch?

Yup, that's him.

Good old Jeb Wickersham,

who made the family fortune.

Kind of like the Kennedys.

He was like Joe, the father,

except he didn't
make all his money

running moonshine for the mob.

[ Chuckles ]

How did old Jeb
make his fortune?

Um, he was a sailor
turned merchant

who, as I understand it,

became one of the
first shipping magnates.

Hmm.

[ Sighs ]

George?

Mmm?

Do you think this
house is really haunted?

[ Scoffs ]

All I know is that
my grandfather thought so.

[ Thunderclap ]


That's a nasty storm!

Oh, for the...

The generator just crapped out.

George!

I have a really bad
feeling about this.

Can we just do
it in the morning?

Not if we want power.

I think I've found the problem.

There's a loose wire
on the sparkplug.

Will you pass me the pliers?

I don't see pliers!

They're up by the...
near the screwdriver tray.

It's so dark,
I can't see anything.

OK, look.

Honey, they're right here.

Look. Those are pliers.

George!

You guys all right?

That thing could
have killed you!

You! You did this!

You pulled that wire
to get us out here!

What the hell are
you talking about?

I want you off this island
by the time the storm passes!

Get out of here!

George, calm down!

Are you OK, baby?

You saw him, Nicky.

That sparkplug
wouldn't fall off.

Someone loosened it,
and it wasn't you or me.

But how would he know
when it was going to fall?

Because he's the one
who loosened it!

I think he killed my dad,
made it look like an accident,

and then tried to do the same
thing to you and me last night.

What would his motive be
for trying to kill your father?

The bigger question
is what's his alibi?

He told Sheriff Lindy he was
running an errand for Dad.

Errand? Dad lived
in Shoal Harbour.

Peter lived out on
the island. It doesn't add up.

There's something more than
just an accident going on here,

I can feel that.

But how can we be sure
it wasn't a suicide?

I mean, we don't know
your dad's state of mind.

Listen, I know what
a suicide looks and feels like.

I was in that house
when my grandfather...

...killed himself.

My dad told me that
it was an accident,

that my grandfather was cleaning
his gun and it discharged,

but what my dad didn't know
is that my grandfather

was seeing things, and
secretly telling me.

What things?

The, um...

The spirit of a woman.

Well then, that's how
the rumour got started.

The rumour's been around
as long as the house.

My mother thought my grandfather

started believing
the haunting stories

because, you know,
he lost his mind.

Did you think he was crazy?

He wasn't crazy.

Anything that happened out there

after that just
added to the legend.

And that's what this...

Peter is up to.

He knows that if my dad's
death looks like an accident,

people will just
blame it on the curse.

Oh, my lands, is that Georgie 4?

As I live and breathe,

I didn't think I'd
ever see you again.

Yeah, well...

death happens.

It certainly does.

And I'm sorry for your loss.

I truly am.

I'm Nicky.

I'm George's wife.

Sorry, this is...
Virginia Roberts.

You're every bit as pretty
as 3 said you were.

You know, he carried your
wedding picture everywhere.

Who's 3?

Georgie 4's father.

I named him 3 because he's
the 3rd George Wickersham.

Well, that makes sense!

[ Chuckles ]

Hey, why don't you join us?

Oh, I have to get back to
the shop. I don't have time.

And... and what
is it that you do?

Oh, studio portraits,

restorations,
little bit of everything.

You're a painter!

No, no, photographs.

I also run
photographic workshops.

Excuse me. I have to
go use the restroom.

I don't blame you

for selling that place.

Not one bit, Georgie 4.

Please!

So, Virginia,

have you ever been
out to the island?

Oh, my lands,
many times over the years.

I've taken all
their family portraits.

Ah. And what do you
think of the house?

It's beautiful.

I just hope whoever
buys it is told the truth.

The truth?

George hasn't told you?

It's haunted!

Oh yeah, so I've heard!

But, uh... come on, Virginia.

I mean... you don't
really believe that, do you?

What I believe is irrelevant.

I can't wait for you
to see it, Margie.

It's so beautiful here!

I'm inspired to draw
like I've never felt before!

I'm so excited.

I can use all the
inspiration I can get.

Are there any good
wine stores up there?

Um, no.

Pack wisely, leave
your pumps at home.

Come ready to write.

Hey, any handsome neighbours

looking for
desperate housewives?

[ Chuckles ]

It's an island, Margie.

We'll be the only ones on it.

Hope she doesn't
have too many bags.

I know. She will, though.

Love you!

Margie!

Nick! Hey!

Listen, uh, I'll
catch up with you later.

Yeah, you bet.

OK!

Oh my God, I can't
believe you own an island!

I know. It's amazing, right?

That's so cool! Billionaires
and movie stars have islands.

What was he saying to you?

Oh! Is he hot, or what?

He was talking about

some unfinished business
on the island or something.

Hope it's me.

Margie!

Hey!
How's it going?

Good.

This everything?

That's everything!

Travelling light.
I'm surprised!

Oh yeah!

What are you doing here?

I live here,
Mrs. Wickersham.

Remember?
I used to live out there.

The night George's
father died, you left.

Sorry, is that any
of your business?

Don't have an alibi, do you?

You don't need an alibi unless
you're accused of something.

Nicky!

Be careful on that island.

Wickershams aren't
always welcome.

I don't believe
in that curse story.

I know someone
killed George's father,

and I'm gonna find out who.

Let me know if you do.

How you holding up?

I'm OK.

I know I wasn't
very close with my dad

when we were together, but...

I really did love him.

I never doubted that.

It's just, after
my grandfather died,

we just stopped talking.

It was like he
shut the door on me.

I always felt like he had a...

...a sense of relief
when I left for college.

I'm sorry you didn't
get a chance to meet him.

He would have loved you.

Your mom's there too?

Yeah.

Half of Shoal Harbour
came out when we buried her.

That was the saddest
day of my life.

Grandparents, aunts, uncles,
they're all buried here.

This graveyard is why I left.

Made me feel like
I would die here, too.

You're not gonna
die here, George.

How can you be so sure?

Because I'm an artist,

and artists feel things
that non-artists can't.

You're gonna grow old,

and watch Georgie 5
have Georgie 6.

[ Chuckling ]

I think we have to
leave now, Georgie 4.

Right. Thanks.

Why don't you go
with them down to the dock,

and I'll just meet you inside?

God, I love you.

Oh, I love you.

[ Sighs ]

What is this legacy of secrets

that has my husband
so troubled, Jebidiah?

Nothing like a good
old family funeral

to bring out the best
and worst in people.

Why are you here?

To pay my respects.

And to show you and your husband

you're not as smart
as you think you are.

I'm gonna trust you
keep this to yourself.

I didn't know he was
coming here alone that night.

Money order receipt?

$83,000.

That's all he had, except
for this house and island.

Who's Pamela?

The other woman.

I don't understand.

The old man had a girlfriend
who lives up the coast.

Nobody knew, not even
me until that night.

He asked me to give her that
money order with a letter.

Said it was urgent.

When I got back,

he was already dead.

So what was the big secret?

He'd been seeing
her for 22 years.

But he made me swear
not to tell anybody.

I would have died for that man.

He was like a father to me.

I feel like
I'm betraying him now.

But I can't let his only son

think that I killed him.

We owe you an apology, Peter.

I would have thought
the same thing.

Oh...

I'd, uh,

like to stop out tomorrow,
pick up my tools,

if that'd be OK
with your husband.

Of course, yeah.

I'll talk to him.
I'm sure it'll be fine.

I know it's a shock,
George, but it makes sense.

Of course it makes sense.

It's my family all over.

Secrets and lies.

God, I hate this place!

[ Sighs ]

I can't wait to sell this house

and put this all behind us.

You know what's sad,

is George wanting
to sell this place.

You can't let him!

It's not my call.

What are you talking
about? You're his wife!

Can you believe this place

has been in his family
since before the Civil War?

I'll tell you what
do to. Divorce him.

[ Chuckles ]

No, hear me out.
You divorce.

You get a great lawyer,
you divorce him,

take the house and the island

in a community
property settlement.

He doesn't want it anyway.

Then just remarry him
and do what you want with it!

If you weren't certifiable,
I would consider it.

[ Laughing ]

I have been thinking, though.

You know what I would really
love to do with this place?

What?

I'd love to turn it
into a retreat.

You know, for artists.

Like, painters and
writers and poets.

Maybe work out something with
Wrenfield College, the students

could come and
do a course for credit.

Yeah. Oh, do it!

You should absolutely do it.

George wouldn't have
to be here, would he?

OK, look. Maybe if
you just tell him

what you wanted,
he would reconsider!

I don't know.
He's pretty adamant.

Oh, come on.
He is your husband.

Give him one of those romantic
evenings guys just dream about,

and he'll be adamant
that you do it.

It doesn't work that way
once you're married.

Oh, come on! It works that way
before, during and after.

[ Giggles ]

I need two good-size heads,

about yea big, maybe this big.

OK. Would you
rather go yourself?

No, I need to
stay here. Work.

Then go to work!
I got your list, Nicky.

I'm pretty sure I can handle
a supply run on my own.

OK.

Well, lookee here!
Peter told me

there was another Wickersham
back on the island.

Hello, Mr. Trinkle.

Sorry about your dad.

One of a kind, that one.

Thank you.

Uh, Mr. Trinkle,
this is my wife, Nicky.

Cal Trinkle!

Shoal Harbour postmaster

and rural route carrier.

Nice to meet
you, Mr. Trinkle.

I asked Cal for
a ride out to get my tools.

Couldn't haul them in my kayak.
I hope you don't mind.

It's fine.

We used to come out here

every Wednesday,
remember, George?

Rain or shine, wind,
sleet, hail, snow,

you know the poem!

Yeah.

You know, your mom never failed

to offer me a bit of lunch!

That's your cue.

Oh!

Um, would you care
for something to eat

while Peter collects his things?

Well, that's kind
of you, Mrs. Wickersham.

I don't mind if you do!

He doesn't mind if you do.

OK.
Go. Enjoy your meal.

Dearie?

Yes?

Thirty-five years,
every Wednesday!

Nicky told me about Dad's...

...situation.

Thank you for your discretion.

I loved your dad.

I mean, I know I wasn't his son,

but he was the closest thing
to a father that I ever had.

That would make us,
uh, brothers, would it?

God, I hope not.

Come on, let's start over.
Good to meet you.

Peter?

Hello?

Peter?

Hey!

Is everything all right?

Yeah. We had a little talk.

Your husband, he's, uh...
he's a nice guy.

Well, I think so.

It's too bad we had to meet
under these circumstances.

I think his dad would have liked

us all having
beers or something.

Oh! Whoops!

Sorry!

What is that?

I don't know.

I didn't even know it was here.

Kind of creepy, huh?

Look at this... AH!

[ Screams ]

[ Laughs ]

First time in here?

Yes, it is my
first time in here.

[ Laughs ]

I kind of had this idea
to turn this place

into, like,
a bunkhouse or something.

A bunkhouse?

You planning on
turning this place into a ranch?

No, like more of
a retreat for artists.

There you are!
What are you guys doing in here?

I was telling him

about my plans to renovate.

Renovate, huh?

You know, I'm pretty
good at doing that.

We can put in a new door,
a kitchen area here,

and a living room there.

Sounds perfect.

Sounds like a pretty
expensive renovation.

Not really. It's mostly
just paint and plaster.

Yeah, but what
about your labour?

Ah, we'll just call it
a wash for 5 years of free rent.

Are you serious?

Yeah, why not?

I've always wanted
to start my own company.

Shoal Harbour Renovations.

This could be
the job to launch it.

Well, sounds great!

I just have to get
George on board first.

How you gonna do that?

One step at a time.

[ Laughing ]

Hey!

Hey.

So, I'm gonna ask you something.

OK.

And I realize that
it is insensitive,

and maybe, you know,
out of line, but...

I gotta ask!

How would you feel

about me staying here
for a little while?

Oh, Nick.

OK, wait. Wait, wait.

I could make myself
available to the realtor,

maybe spruce the place
up a little bit.

You go back to Boston, work,

and I can stay up here and...

Explore!

Explore what?

Well, Celia said

that my new work needed
to be more passionate.

This place...
inspires the passion!

[ Scoffs ]

I just... I wanna paint up here.

Just for a little while,
just to see how it goes.

No.

OK.

Really?

It's not like you asked me

to not sell the place.

Besides, who am I

to question the muse
of an artist, huh?

I'll leave early on Friday,
and be back up here by night.

[ Chuckles ]

You're the best, George.

Mm-hmm.

You're just good at working me.

And you gotta remember
that island living

isn't what you're used to.

You can't run out to the store
when you need something.

I will keep things well stocked!

Please,

please, be very careful.

You know?
There's no 911 out here.

I'm gonna be fine, George.

Besides, Margie's gonna be out
here working on her new play.

That sounds like a plan.

[ Sighs ]

George...

Why did your father believe
that he was gonna die out here?

[ Sighs ]

I don't know.

He probably thought

it was all part of
the Wickersham curse.

What is that?

Curse? Why do you...

why do you keep saying that?

Isn't that what it is?
Something that haunts you?

So if the curse
killed your grandfather,

it was gonna
come after your dad?

Well, that's why he
didn't come to our wedding.

[ Scoffs ]

Because he was afraid

that this curse would
follow him to Boston.

That's why he always
had an excuse,

you know, to avoid us!

Are you listening
to yourself right now?

Well, what else would it be?
I mean, it makes perfect sense!

God, that's why he never
invited us to come visit him!

Yeah, that and his secret life!

No.

He was protecting you.

Because he loved you.

Can we just talk
about this tomorrow?

All righty!

Medication time!

Thank you,

Nurse Cratchit!

Mmm!

Hey!

Whoa! You better
slow down there, sailor!

Ah, come on.

Let a guy enjoy
his last two days of liberty.

I'm back in Boston
the day after tomorrow.

Mmm.

Oh! That's different than
your usual stuff. I like it.

Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

I've been doing some pretty
good drawings, but I'd really

love to get my paints up here.

I'll just bring 'em
back next Friday.

How about you? Can I bring back
some tools of your trade?

Hmm.

Dozen pens, bottle of Dom,

and a desperate actor
looking for work?

I'm glad I asked.

[ Chuckling ]

That's reasonable.

[ Both laughing ]

Totally reasonable.

You know, I'm not so sure

about leaving you
here with Margie.

She could be a bad
influence on you.

Why?

Think I might start writing?

[ Chuckles ]

You see? You know?

I think this island
is bringing out

another part of
your personality.

Really? Good, or bad?

Oh...

Um...

Well, I gotta say good.

Mmm!

Mmm...

Or, uh... or maybe bad!

Yeah. Definitely...

Good bad.

[ Laughing ]

Oh, you are so beautiful.

[ Giggles ]

I got a deal for you.

I'm always looking
for a good deal.

Mm-hmm?

You, um...

You tell me what you want...

Uh-huh?

And I'll do it.

Uh... OK!

Oh! Um...

Well, what I really want...

More than anything right now...

...is to keep the house.

What?

[ Chuckling ]

Keep the house?

I wanna use it as an art house.

For me...

Maybe other painters,
and writers...

Just for a year.

[ Sighs ]

Mmm...

OK, I don't think
that's a good idea.

No men. Only women.

Maybe some young, hot co-eds
from Wrenfield College.

[ Both laughing ]

Oh...

[ Moaning ]

Yeah...

[ Laughing ]

OK, where would they stay?

The servants' quarters.

Mmm.

The house...

would be for you.

And me.

[ Chuckling ]

We'll open up all these windows,

and this room will
become a common room,

where they can show their work.

OK. What's all this

gonna cost?

Peter's gonna do it for free.

Well, that's a good price.

What's the catch?

Therapy. Or guilt.
Take your pick.

Right.

[ Chuckling ]

I was thinking we'd put,

like, a dozen bedrooms upstairs,

but this is what
I really wanted to show you.

It's really creepy, right?

Yeah.

Do you know what
it was used for?

No idea.

Looks like some kind of...

...cell.

I got a year to make a go of it!

I think it was the tax
write-offs that convinced him.

Oh, excuse me.

I think it was something
else that convinced him.

Hmm?

[ Both laughing ]

Silly.

Be safe.
Don't worry.

Bye.
Bye!

â™ªâ™ª Beautiful summer â™ª

â™ª Watch all the sadness
we had going home â™ª

â™ª Reach out for better

â™ª We know

â™ª Beautiful lover

â™ª Now that our hopes
are so high, let's move on â™ª

â™ª We treat each other

â™ª You know

â™ª Beautiful summer

â™ª Watch all the sadness
we had going home â™ª

â™ª Reach out for better

â™ª We know â™ª

Hmm.

Sounds wonderful.

How many grad students do you
imagine staying at one time?

Well, I'd start with 4 girls.

I'd have two courses,
one painting, one drawing,

and if everything goes well,

I could handle 8 during
the second session.

And this is the
complete proposal,

as well as your course
objectives and syllabus?

Yes, but I would be
open to any suggestions

or ideas that you have.

Well, um...

I'd love to help you
make this happen, Nicky.

I'll talk to the dean
first thing in the morning.

Oh, yes! Thank you
so much, Joan!

[ Laughing ]

Oh! Wow, sorry.
That's OK!

Bye!
Bye.

So you managed to convince

Georgie 4 not to sell?

[ Chuckles ]

That house has been cursed

since the day it
was built, Nicky.

And what do you know
about the curse?

No more than anyone else.

Over the years,
the Wickersham males

have had a high incidence
of unfortunate accidents

on that island.

Legend has it that
their summer house

will continue to claim
the lives of the Wickersham men

until their bloodline
is eradicated.

You said "men."

Why men?

Don't know.
It's just the legend.

[ Chuckles ]

Well, I don't put
much stock in legends.

In my head, I'm an artist,

but my feet are firmly
grounded in reality.

Any artist worth their salt
relies on their instincts.

What do your instincts
tell you about me?

Oh!

That you're...

a caring, sensitive woman.

Baloney.

[ Chuckles ]

Your head tells you
I'm a crackpot.

But I'm old, and must be sweet,

so don't offend.

[ Chuckles ]

So what do your
instincts really tell you?

That...

You've had a life of pain,

of disappointment.

Anger.

But you're at peace now.

Something deeper.

You're sick.

My instincts were
right about you.

I'd love to see
your art sometime.

George?
You're a broker,

not a carpenter.

Think maybe we should wait
till Peter comes out to help?

I think I can climb
a ladder as well as Peter.

Yeah, but you don't
look as good doing it.

Now, just wait a minute!

George may have a mini-keg
instead of a 6-pack...

Whoa-ho!

But he looks pretty good to me.

Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

Now, could you pass me
the cordless drill,

if you're not
too busy over there?

Anyway...

I was thinking

that the students could each

make dinner one night
a week, Monday through Thursday.

Friday, I'll cook. Saturdays
is "fend for yourself,"

because I figure they'd wanna go

into town for the weekend.

Oh, that sounds great.

The only problem,
really, I see is Peter.

Why is he a problem?

Well, Nicky, I think he's
the wrong kind of inspiration

for a secluded group
of young female co-eds.

I heard that!

Would you please stop?

Do you know how hard it was

to get him to say yes?

Oh-ho, Nicky, I bet it was!

NO!
Oh my God!

Oh my God!

George! George!

George!

Oh my God!
Check if he's breathing!

I can't tell!

My God!

What do we do?

I got a call the other day
from Gary Hanson.

You remember him from your show?

No, not really.

Well, he was asking about you.

He said: "Whatever happened..."

[ Machine beeping ]

Did you hear

what I said?

"The female Andrew Wyeth."

That is a compliment, Nicky.

Listen, Nicky.

I'm saying this as a friend,

and not as an art dealer.

You need to start
painting again.

I can't.

I'm not pretending
to understand your grief.

God knows, if my husband
was in a coma for a month,

I couldn't leave my house!

But I am not an artist,
Nicky, and you are.

And the way that
artists deal with life,

the good and the bad,
is through their art.

George wouldn't want
you to stop painting.

No matter what.

Honour him with your gift.

Bye.

Finished up the bedrooms

at the top floor
of the servants' quarters.

Thanks, Peter.

You didn't have to do that.

Well, it's no big deal.

I really wish you'd let me
pay you for your work, Peter.

Not a chance.

You gonna finish it?

I don't know yet.

Well, for what it's worth,
I think you should.

It'll only raise the value of
the place when you do resell it.

[ Nicky sighs ]

[ Moans ]

[ Chuckles ]

What is that?

[ Sighs ]

[ Sighs ]

My God!

This is from the 1800s.

[ Sighs ]

[ Sighs ]

What is this?

â™ªâ™ª No, no, no â™ª

[ Phone ringing ]

Wait, Peter. I'll get it.

â™ª No, no, no â™ªâ™ª

It's Nicky.

Your timing really sucks, Nicky!

It's not too late
to call, is it?

Uh, actually, 5 minutes
later would have been better.

What's up?

Well...

I'm in Maine, on the island.

I decided to finish the retreat.

Uh... are you sure
that's a good idea?

No.

But I think I needed it somehow.

Anyway, I just...

I really wanted to talk to you,

and I'm gonna be
in Boston tomorrow,

and I was hoping that
we could do breakfast.

Um... how about, um, lunch?

I'm gonna be working late.

Yeah. The cafÃ©, 2:00?

Sounds good!
See you tomorrow!

Hmm!

Now, don't make
a liar out of me.

[ Giggling ]

Everything looks all right.

We'll see what the
blood tests turn up,

but at this point,
I wouldn't worry about it.

I have never gotten dizzy
like that before, Doctor Burke.

You're under a lot of stress,

which is normal, considering

George's condition.

Have you been eating regularly?

Yeah, not really.

Hmm. Why don't we start there.

Three meals. Daily vitamin.

Take it easy, and I'll call you

when I get the results
of your blood work.

I found it in this creepy room,

hidden behind a stone wall.

What is it?

I'm not sure,

but I'm gonna take it
to Prof. Shockley.

I'm pretty sure that it belonged
to George's distant grandfather,

the one that built
the summer house.

And I found it with this glass
plate negative of a woman.

It must be over 100 years old.

And look at this.

Mmm, it's sweet!

You know what?
I remember taking this.

Margie, look close.
Behind me and George.

What? Creepy little room?

No. Look at the
shadow behind us.

Doesn't it look like a shape?

Like there's a person
standing behind us?

No. All I see is a room.

It's a shipping ledger.

Mm-hmm.

So what exactly is it used for?

It's the way a ship's captain

kept track of his
shipping transactions.

The list of items are logged

under the date
they're acquired here.

This is where it
was paid for, here.

The number of the item,

and the location
where it was purchased.

So these dates, 1854-1855,

those were the actual
dates that they were written?

Well, assuming it's
authentic, and it appears to be.

Have you read through
the whole ledger?

No, I haven't.

Ah. Well, it's in
incredible shape.

Well, I found it in
a sealed strongbox.

Ah, OK.

Look at this.

Oftentimes, this type of captain

would make log notes
in the ledger like this.

"High winds made for

"a quicker turn around the horn.

"Lost crewman Joyce
to a bout of scurvy."

Not exactly Hemingway,

but it might make for
some interesting reading.

And there may also be
some monetary value to it,

based on the history
it's documenting.

Mmm.

Oh my God.

What's wrong?

Prof. Shockley,

please tell me
I'm reading this wrong.

No, you're not reading it wrong.

And I don't think
there's any question

that it's of
historical value now.

Does your husband
know about this?

N-no!

No, I don't...

I think he would
have told me if he knew

that his family was...
buying and selling slaves.

There's no way he
could have known.

Selling slaves is not

something George would
have kept from you.

I know.

It was a secret that
Jebidiah tried to bury,

and that's why it was
hidden in this wall.

George didn't know.

But maybe someone did.

What if the legend of
this house being haunted

is somehow tied
to Jebidiah's secret?

The glass negative.

What?

Remember? I told you
about it in Boston.

Yeah.

What if the person
in that glass negative

is somehow tied to the spirit
that's haunting this house?

I need to make a print of it.

I haven't seen
one of these in decades!

Where did you get it?

I found it at the summer house.

Do you know who it is?

No, I was hoping that
maybe you could tell me that.

Can you make a print
off of something this old?

I guess. It's a bit tricky,
but I've done it before.

I should have a few by tomorrow.

I found a ledger that indicates

that Jebidiah Wickersham was
buying and selling slaves.

Oh, my lands!

Now, my instincts tell me
that it's all tied to the curse.

I know this sounds weird,

and I haven't told anyone,
not even my best friend Margie,

but I feel like the curse
has a hold of George.

That doesn't sound weird at all.

I feel like

if I can figure out
a way to make restitution

for the Wickershams'
transgressions,

this curse, or this
spirit, whatever it is,

will give me my George back.

I'll do whatever I can to help.

You don't think it's dangerous

for me to stay
out there, do you?

The legend says

that the curse
is tied to the bloodline.

But I'm not
a Wickersham by birth.

Your instincts
are better than mine.

I don't question them,
and I don't think you should.

[ Engine starting ]

Where's the hammer?

No, no! No, no!

Hello? Hello?

Come on, Nicky. Where are you?

[ Ringing ]

I don't know.
She must not have it with her.

No biggie. She's probably
already back from the island.

We'll check around
town when we get there.

[ Grunts ]

No, no.

Don't do it!
Don't do it,

don't do it!

[ Sobbing ]

Oh, my lands!

[ Thumping, creaking ]

Is somebody there?

[ Creaking ]

No!

[ Creaking ]

[ Sniffling ]

[ Woman wailing ]

[ Gasps ]

Who's there?

[ Woman wailing ]

Is somebody there?
Who's there?

[ Wailing ]

[ Screams ]

What are you doing in here?

I was just...

looking for a hammer,
and the door shut on me!

It looks like somebody
locked it from out here.

That's impossible.
I was the only one here.

It was so dark in there.

I think it just started
to mess with my mind.

I swear to you,
I started to hear voices!

What kind of voices?

Margie, it was like
there was a woman weeping,

like, crying or pleading
for help or something.

Oh! God, I would have
totally freaked out.

Where were you?

I thought you'd
gonna be back sooner.

We tried to call your cell,
but you didn't pick up!

Peter wanted to show me some
of the sights of Shoal Harbour.

Is that right?

Mm-hmm.
And how were they?

We didn't make it past

the high school
make-out spot, Baker's Bluff.

The guy has got
a PhD in kissing.

[ Chuckles ]

Nicky, I...

I hate to bail on you,

but I have to be in Boston

for a meeting the
day after tomorrow.

My agent just called
me this afternoon.

Sorry.

Of course! No, no.

Yeah, I get it. I totally
understand. It's fine.

I'm leaving in the morning.
Why don't you come with me?

I hate the idea of you
going there alone.

It's fine! I could just have
Peter stay until you get back.

Yeah, I hate that even more.

[ Laughing ]

What about this curse thing?

If there's anything

to it, I just...

The curse is against
the Wickersham bloodline,

and George is in Boston,

so I'll be fine.

Come here.

a merchant dealing in goods.

These people are savages

taken from jungles
and put in homes.

How bad can it be for them?

I'm reluctant, but
they offer so much money,

I can't say no.

[ Sighs ]

I know it's wrong,

but the woman moves me
like no other.

She is called Kimmika,

the daughter of a king,

and she rouses
the most basic passion in me.

I want to own her

as much as I want
her to want me.

[ Phone ringing ]

Hello?

Nicky, this is Dr. Burke.
How are you feeling?

Good! Very good, actually.

Haven't felt faint
since I've been here.

Hope you're not
calling with bad news.

I am calling with news.

We just got your
blood tests back,

and it looks like
you're pregnant.

Nicky?

Are you there?

Uh, yeah! Yeah, I...

Now, you'll have to
come in for a check-up,

and start on pre-natal vitamins.

Are you sure?

100%. You're pregnant!

Congratulations!

Is it a boy or a girl?

I don't know yet.
It's too soon

to tell.

What do you want?
Boy or a girl?

I want...

...to be able to share
whatever it is with George.

[ Machine beeping ]

I just want it to be healthy.

I wish you would come with me.

I'm gonna be fine, Margie.

I just need to...

figure out the mystery
behind this Wickersham curse,

and then I'll be back
in Boston the very next day.

OK.

[ Phone ringing ]

Sorry.

Hello?

Nicky, I made a print
off your glass plate.

I think you should see this.

I'm just at
the cafÃ© with Margie.

I can be there in a few minutes.

I'll put on a fresh pot
of coffee. Just come right in.

Considering the age, we're
lucky it's as clear as it is.

I made the enlargement
so as to get a better look

at the details.

Oh, it's amazing.

Do you recognize the building
she's standing in front of?

It's the servants'
quarters on the island.

Right.

I wonder who she is.

Hmm! It's anybody's guess.

There's something
else I want you

to have a look at. Right there.

Oh my God.

It's the brooch.

It's the Wickersham
family brooch.

It certainly is.

Why is that a big deal?

Maybe she was
a Mrs. Wickersham.

It's Kimmika.

Who?

She's an African princess

that Jebidiah wrote
about in his ledger.

I need to get
back to the island.

Whoa!

Whoa, hold on!

I think this is getting a little

too complicated for
someone in your condition.

Margie.

[ Sighs ]

You're pregnant?

I just found out.

Certain crystals
are charged with an energy

that is directly in tune

with a person's life force.

And that energy
can be tapped into

if one understands
the power of it.

You think that crystal

call tell the sex
of an unborn child?

The energy of the child

and the energy of
the crystal will interact,

causing it to spin.

Clockwise for a boy,
counter-clockwise for a girl.

What if it's both?

Shh!

Clockwise.

It's a boy.

Oh Nicky, it's wonderful!


What are you talking about?

It's a Wickersham!

He's the last of the bloodline.

You're afraid of the curse.

But the baby's not born yet.

I mean, how can the curse
possibly know it's a boy?

I could be wrong!

[ Phone ringing ]

Hello?

Hey Nicky, it's Peter.

Listen, I'm not gonna
make it out there tonight,

so there's no need
to come pick me up.

What's the problem?

There's a storm coming,

and I gotta get this roof
patched before it hits.

OK, I'll meet you
at the dock at 9:00.

I'll give you the keys.
9:00 it is.

Lock it up out there tonight.
It's gonna be a rough one.

Yeah, OK. Bye.

[ Sighs ]

The idea of owning her

fills me with passion
I can barely contain.

I will log her
"died in transit,"

then take her home.

The house for the servants
I plan to employ

will be where I keep her

until she offers herself to me
of her own free will.

Kimmika refuses my advances.

It's her proud heritage
as the daughter of a king.

My wife has
discovered my secret,

and left me no choice
but to kill Kimmika.

Oh, no, no! Not tonight.

Not tonight!

[ Clinking ]

[ Gasps ]

[ Grunting ]

Oh God!

[ Grunting ]

OK, OK.

[ Sobbing ]

[ Gasps ]

[ Banging ]

[ Gasps ]

[ Gasps ]

[ Gasps ]

[ Woman wailing ]

[ Grunting ]

[ Grunting ]

[ Screaming ]

[ Screaming ]

[ Grunting ]

She was brought here as a slave.

I think that the curse is tied

to the necklace
she's wearing somehow.

Your instinct may be right.

This brooch is
a symbol of royalty

to a number of African tribes.

Well, he wrote
that she was a princess.

Well, then this is the
equivalent of the crown jewels,

with tremendous
value to the family.

Valuable enough that
it would allow her spirit

to seek revenge
if it were stolen?

[ Scoffs ]

I'm an anthropologist,
not a spiritualist.

But if I were so disposed,

I would think that the emotion

tied to such a powerful
piece of jewellery

would lend itself

to revenge at any cost.

I need your help, George.

The curse that's haunted your
family is now our son's legacy.

Kimmika's hatred allows her

to cross beyond her world
into this one.

I know she's holding

onto you, George.

I know she's keeping you
from coming back to me.

I need to break this curse.

I need to end it for you,

and for our son.

But I need your
love to guide me.

[ Sighs ]

I can't do this on my own.

He strangled her
with his bare hands,

and then he buried her
on the island somewhere.

Oh, my lands!

I've been researching
afterlife activity,

and what would cause
a spirit to haunt a house.

Every source that I've read

says that a violent
or tragic death

would cause the victim
to stay here.

I'd say this qualifies!

They're not all malevolent,

but I would say that
his treatment of Kimmika

would certainly
justify her rage.

Listen to me, Nicky.

There are no guarantees
in the spirit world.

You've got to leave this
place, and never come back!

I can't do that.

I can't risk losing my baby.

You could lose
his life and yours

if you go back to that island!

And the history of that family

would indicate that that's
the most popular outcome.

Do you understand that?

It's not something
I want to do, Virginia.

It's something I have to do
for my husband and my son.

Every instinct I have in my body

tells me this spirit
has a hold of George.

He needs me to do this,

and I'm not gonna
let my fear condemn him.

This is a very powerful crystal.

It promotes positive energy
and repels negative energy.

I'll get it back to you soon.

[ Engine starting ]

Where are you, Kimmika?

Is that an invitation?

[ Gasps ]

[ Grunting ]

[ Gasps ]

Oh my God!

Oh my God, she had a baby!

He killed her and her bloodline.

Rest in peace, Kimmika.

I'm so sorry.

[ Chuckles ]

Please don't look at it yet.

It's so bad.

Well, you're not painting
for me, Bobby-Ann.

You're painting for you.

Trust your instincts!

It's really nice! Keep going.

Thanks, Nicky!

Yeah.

There's Georgie 5, all changed

with a nice dry diaper.

Thank you, Auntie Ginny.

Hi, handsome!

Hey, baby.

[ Squeals ]

Pretty!

Thank you!

Oh, this came for you yesterday,

but I wanted to give
it to you myself.

What brings you out?

I heard you guys were
having a symposium out here.

Do you even know
what that means?

It's the Greek word
for a drinking party.

I got it!

What?
It's the grant cheque

for the Wickersham Island
Summer Artists' Retreat.

Yes! Nice!

Let me see it!

Well, I think we
should have a symposium.

Yes, we should.

You are amazing.

Not only do you
turn a haunted island

into a haunt
for starving artists,

but you saved my life.

Not bad for a woman who
had to find the courage

to show her own art.

Well, I'd rather take on

an angry ghost than
a jaded art critic any day.

[ George chuckles ]
