Helmwige! Here! Bring your horse

Tether your stallion
next to my mare to graze

Who is hanging from your saddle?
Sintolt the Hegeling

Ortlinde's mare carries Wittig
the lrming

Sintolt and Wittig were always foes

The stallion is kicking at my mare

The hostility alienates the horses

Quiet, Bruno!

Siegrune, where have you lingered?

There was work to do

Are the others here?

Grimgerde and Rossweisse!
They are riding abreast

Greetings, you riders!

lnto the wood with your steeds

Keep the mares far apart ...

... until the hatred has subsided

My grey has already paid
for the heroes' anger

Welcome!

Were you together?

We were separate and met only today

lf we are all assembled ...

... let us set out for Valhalla
to bring Wotan his warriors

One of us is still missing

Brunnhilde is still
with the Walsung

We must wait for her

We will receive a grim welcome
if we arrive without her

This way!

Brunnhilde is galloping here

She is heading towards the firs

How Grane is panting!

l never saw Valkyries galloping so

What is on her saddle?
That is no hero

She's carrying a woman

How did she find her?

She gives no greeting!

Brunnhilde, don't you hear us?

Help our sister from her horse!

Powerful Grane has sunk
to the ground

She lifts the woman from the saddle

Sister, what has happened?

Help me in my sorest need!

Whence come you?
Only fugitives fly thus

l am fleeing and being pursued
by the father of battles

Have you lost your senses?
Speak! Tell us!

Sisters, look from the mountain!
Look north whether Wotan is near

Can you see him yet?

A storm threatens

Heavy clouds are massing

Father is riding his sacred steed

The raging hunter is coming!
Shield me, sisters!

Save this woman!
But who is she?

This is Sieglinde,
Siegmund's sister and bride

Wotan is towering with rage
against the Walsungs

Brunnhilde was to have withheld
victory from her brother

But l sheltered Siegmund
in defiance of the god ...

... who smote him with his spear

Siegmund fell, but l fled
with his wife

To save her l have hurried to you

Protect me too, in my fear,
from punishment

Deluded sister,
what have you done?

Woe, Brunnhilde!

Have you deliberately disobeyed
the father of hosts?

Darkness looms from the north
A raging storm steers hither

Wildly neighs father's horse,
fearfully snorting as it comes!

Woe to this poor woman
if Wotan finds her

Lend me your swiftest steed
that would spirit the woman away

Are you urging open defiance?

Rossweisse, lend me your courser!

He has never fled from father

Helmwige, hear me!
l obey our father

Give me your horse!

See my distress!

Stand by me as l have stood by you

Save this wretched woman!

Do not concern yourself over me

Death is all l ask

Who bade you bear me from battle?

Had l been struck by the weapon
that slew Siegmund ...

... l should have met my end
united with him!

Far from Siegmund!

Death overwhelms me at the thought

lf l am not to curse you
for your care ...

... then hear my solemn entreaty

Thrust your sword into my heart

Live, woman, for love's sake!

Save the pledge from him

A Walsung is growing in your womb

Save me, fearless one!

Save my child!

Shelter me, you maidens!

The storm is approaching
Fly, all who fear it!

Away with the woman!

No Valkyrie dares protect her

Save me!

Save a mother!

Then flee at once, and flee alone

l will brave Wotan's vengeance

l will detain the angry god
while you escape his rage

Which way shall l turn?

Which of you, sisters,
ranged east?

To the east stretches a forest ...

... into which Fafner carried
the Nibelung treasure

He assumed the form of a dragon

ln a cave he keeps watch
over Alberich's ring

A forbidding place for a woman

The wood would shelter her
from Wotan's wrath

The mighty one shuns the place

Wotan is galloping to the rock!
Brunnhilde, hark to the thunder!

Hurry eastward!

Defiant, endure all dangers,
hunger, thirst, thorns and stones

Laugh if weakness wears you down

Know one thing, and guard it ever

ln your womb you carry the world's
most wondrous hero

For him preserve the fragments
of the sword

He who forges the sword anew
shall one day wield it

Let him take his name from me

Siegfried, joy in victory!

Marvellous miracle!

Most glorious maid!

Thank you for your comfort

For him whom we loved
l will save the child

May reward one day smile at you!

Farewell!

Sieglinde's woe blesses you!

Stay, Brunnhilde!

He has reached the rock!

Woe, Brunnhilde!
Vengeance blazes forth!

Sisters, help! My heart fails me!

His rage will shatter me

Keep out of sight!
Stay silent when he calls!

Woe! Wotan leaps from his horse

Hither he hastens,
breathing revenge!

Where is the guilty one?

Do you dare hide the miscreant?

Your wrath fills us with fear!

What have we done to provoke you?

Do you mock me? Take care!

l know you are hiding Brunnhilde

Recoil from her!
She is cast off for ever!

From pursuit she fled to us

ln fear she roused your wrath

For our anguished sister's sake
we beg you to curb your fury

Weak-willed womanish brood!

Did you inherit such spineless
spirits from me?

Did l make you bold in battle ...

... did l make your
hearts harsh ...

... so that you wild ones now whine
when my wrath punishes perfidy?

Then learn, you whimperers,
her offence

None but she knew my
inmost thoughts

None but she knew the source
of my resolve

She was my will's creative womb

Now she has broken the sacred bond

She has disloyally flouted
her father's command ...

... and turned against me
the weapon my will alone made her!

Do you hear, Brunnhilde ...

... you to whom l granted
helmet and spear ...

... affection, name and life?

Do you hear me make this charge,
and yet hide from your accuser ...

... whose punishment you evade?

Here l am, father

Pronounce my sentence!

The sentence does not stem from me.
You brought punishment on yourself

My will brought you into being ...

...but you have set your
will against it

You could carry out my orders only,
but you have given counter-orders

You were my wish's maid ...

... but your wishes thwarted mine

You were my shield-bearer ...

... but you raised it against me

You were my arbiter of fate ...

... but you chose to frustrate me

You were my rouser of heroes ...

... but you roused them against me

Wotan has told you what you were

Tell yourself what you are now

No longer are you my wish's agent

You have been a Valkyrie

Henceforth be what you are now!

Would you disown me?

Never again will l send you
from Valhalla ...

... never assign heroes to you

Never again will you bring
victors into my hall

At the god's banquets ...

... never again will you pass
me my drinking-horn

Never again will l kiss my child

From the gods you are cut off ...

... expelled from the race
of the immortals

Our bond is broken

You are banished from my sight

Woe, sister!

Do you take all you once gave?

He who masters you will
take it from you

To this mountain l banish you

l will lock you tight in
defenceless sleep

Let the man then capture the maid
who finds her and wakes her

Retract your curse!

Must the maid be wasted by a man?

Hear our plea!

Spare this dreadful disgrace!

We should share in her shame

Did you not hear what l decreed?

She is banished from your band

No longer shall she ride with you

Her beauty's flower will wither

A husband will win her favours

Henceforth she shall belong
to this masterful man ...

... sit and spin by the fire,
the butt and sport of all mockers

Does her fate appal you?

Then flee the lost one!

Keep away!

Should any of you dare to linger
and sustain her ...

... that fool shall share her fate

Of this l warn you!

Away with you! Shun this rock!

Quickly, ride away now ...

... or calamity will befall you

Was my offence so shameful ...

... that you punish my misdeed
with such shame?

Was what l did to you so base ...

... that you so profoundly
debase me?

Was what l did so dishonourable ...

... that my dereliction now
robs me of honour?

Speak, father!

Look me in the eyes

Silence your wrath

Make clear the hidden guilt
which forces you ...

... inflexibly and obstinately ...

... to repudiate your
favourite child

Ask what you did

lt will explain your guilt to you!

l carried out your command

Did l command you to fight
for the Walsung?

As ruler of battles, you did

But that order l revoked

When Fricka had turned your
intention against you ...

... when you resigned yourself
to her will ...

... you were your own enemy

l fancied that you understood me,
and castigated conscious defiance

But you thought me cowardly
and foolish

So did l not need to
avenge treason?

l am not wise

But one thing l know ...

... that you loved the Walsung

l knew the inner conflict that
compelled you to erase this

You had to see the alternative ...

... though it grieved you ...

... that you should deny Siegmund
your defence

You knew this, yet defended him?

Because for you l kept in sight ...

... the one thing on which
you turned your back in perplexity

She who in war guarded Wotan's back
saw what you could not see

l had to see Siegmund!

l appeared to warn him of death

l looked into his eyes,
l heard his words

l understood the hero's distress

The brave man's laments
rang in my ears ...

... the fearful despair of love ...

... the dauntless defiance
of the saddest of souls

ln my ears was echoed ...

... what, deep in my breast,
filled my heart

Shy, astonished, l stood in shame

l could think only of helping ...

... of sharing victory or death
with Siegmund

l knew that this alone was
the lot to choose

He who breathed this love
into my heart ...

... whose will had bound me
to the Walsung ...

... to him l was inwardly loyal ...

... though l
disobeyed your command

So you did what l longed to do ...

... yet which necessity
forced me not to?

So you thought of bliss ...

... when woe broke my heart ...

... when need roused my wrath ...

... and for love of the world
l dammed up the love in my heart?

While l turned against myself ...

... goaded by frustration ...

... driven by longing
to the dread decision ...

... to end my sorrow in the ruins
of my own world ...

... then bliss was enfolding you

lntoxicated with emotion ...

... you laughingly drank
the draught of love ...

... while, for me, gall was blended
with divine distress

Then follow your foolish instinct

You have broken with me

l must shun you

Never again can l share secret
counsels with you

We can no more work together

While life and breath endure,
the god must never see you again

Unfit for you was the maid ...

... who did not understand you

My own view counselled
one thing only ...

... to love what you had loved

lf l must leave you ...

... if you must sever what
once linked us ...

... and cut from yourself
a half ...

... that belonged wholly to you ...

... do not forget that!

You cannot dishonour what will
always be a part of you ...

... cannot wish for a disgrace
that debases you

You would be demeaned ...

... if you saw me derided

You followed the power of love

Now follow him whom you must love!

lf l must depart from Valhalla,
no longer to work with you ...

... and belong henceforth
to a man as master ...

... do not give me to some boaster

Let whoever wins me not
be worthless

You flouted the father of battles

Now he cannot choose for you

You begot a noble race

No coward can disgrace it

The most dedicated of heroes will
spring from Walsung stock

Do not speak of the Walsung race!
l have flung it off with you

My grudge had to destroy it

She who tore herself
from you saved it

Sieglinde carries the holiest fruit

ln grief and pain ...

... she will bear what she
anxiously hides

Never seek protection for her
from me, nor for her womb's fruit!

She guards the sword you made
for Siegmund

And that l broke in pieces!

Child, do not seek to upset
my decision

Await your fate ...

... whatever befall

l cannot choose for you!

But now l must go

l have already stayed too long

l must turn from you

What you wish l may not know

l must only see
your punishment enforced

What must l suffer?

l shall enclose you in deep sleep

Whoever finds
the weaponless maid ...

... shall awaken her and
win her as wife

lf fetters of sleep are to bind me
as easy booty to any faintheart ...

... one thing you must grant ...

... for which l plead in anguish

Surround my sleep ...

... by fearsome terrors, so that
only the most fearless hero ...

... will find me on the rock!

You ask too much,
too great a favour

This one thing you must grant

Annihilate your child

Trample your favourite under foot.
Crush the maid with your spear

But do not condemn her ...

... to this gross degradation

At your command ...

... let flames flare up

Let their fiery glow
engirdle the rock

Let their tongues lick,
their teeth devour ...

... any coward who ventures
to approach the dread rock

Farewell, valiant child ...

... holiest pride of my heart!

lf l must shun you ...

... and may not again lovingly
give you a greeting ...

... if you may no more
ride beside me ...

... or bring me mead at my meal ...

... if l must lose you,
whom l loved ...

... you, the delight of my eyes ...

... then a bridal fire shall
now burn for you ...

... as never has burned for a bride

Let the glow of fierce flames
encircle the rock

Let it strike fear into
the fainthearts

Cowards shall flee from
Brunnhilde's rock

Only one shall win the bride ...

... one freer than l, the god!

Those radiant eyes ...

... that, smiling, l often
kissed ...

... when the joy of battle
won you an embrace ...

... when the praise of heroes ...

... flowed from your sweet lips ...

... those sparkling eyes ...

... that shone on me in storms ...

... when hopeless yearning
seared my heart ...

... when, amid wild alarm, l longed
for worldly pleasures ...

... for the last time let them
delight me ...

... with their last farewell kiss

On a more fortunate man ...

... let their star shine

For the hapless immortal ...

... they must close for ever

For so does the god now
turn from you

So does he kiss the godhead
from you!

Loge, hear me!

Come hither!

As first l found you,
a fiery glow ...

... as you escaped me,
a wandering flame ...

... as l bound you ...

... so today l summon you!

Arise, flickering flame!

Ring the rock with fire!

Loge! Appear!

He who fears my spear-point ...

... shall never penetrate
the fire!
