<i>Oh, no.</i>

<i>Go away.
Get out of here.</i>

<i>â™ª I never thought
I was someone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Who would take
the wrong turn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But here I contemplate â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª As this slow flame burns â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I went to run and hide,
you know â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I've had a rough patch â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But that doesn't mean
they'll get â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The final laugh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So close the curtains â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And lock the door â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm out of my mind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I want more â™ª</i>

<i>All right. Test.</i>

<i>â™ª I want you by my side â™ª</i>

<i>Amaya is gonna love this.</i>

<i>Nice, that was fast.</i>

<i>Okay, let's see here.</i>

<i>This thing runs so much faster</i>

<i>than my old piece of crap.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Holy cow.</i>

<i>â™ª I never thought
I was someone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Who would take
the wrong turn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But here I contemplate â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª As this slow flame burns â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So close the curtains â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And lock the door â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm out of my mind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I want more â™ª</i>

<i>There you are.</i>

<i>It's nice to see your face.</i>

<i>â™ª Drive across the desert â™ª</i>

<i>I know, I know.</i>

<i>Just remember
who has two thumbs</i>

<i>and gives the best massages
in the world.</i>

<i>Hmm?</i>

<i>â™ª And send â™ª</i>

<i>- Hang on.
â™ª Send the letters â™ª</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>So I haven't ironed out
all the bugs yet</i>

<i>but, um, okay,
you know what, just...</i>

<i>You ready?</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>I got a new computer today.</i>

<i>It's much faster
than my old one.</i>

<i>â™ª Prettiest plains
From state on to state â™ª</i>

<i>Can you, uh,
do you understand it?</i>

<i>â™ª If I had the time â™ª</i>

<i>Oh, I just... I just added
a new feature.</i>

<i>So, uh, when the app
doesn't understand a word,</i>

<i>you just... you just type it in</i>

<i>and it automatically
connects you to the ASL site,</i>

<i>and then there is a
video tutorial on how to do it.</i>

<i>Oh, damn it, damn it.
Hold on, hold on.</i>

<i>One sec, sorry.</i>

<i>Um...</i>

<i>Anyway,
I got the idea from, uh,</i>

<i>from when you told me
how hard it was</i>

<i>for you to understand me</i>

<i>when I'm on Skype.</i>

<i>â™ª And lay... â™ª</i>

<i>So, what do you think?</i>

<i>Amaya, can you... can you type?</i>

<i>You know I can't...</i>

<i>â™ª And if I had my way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'd drive on all day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª From state on to state â™ª</i>

<i>Amaya... slow down,</i>

<i>there's door...</i>

<i>â™ª I'd watch rivers dance â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª From east on to west â™ª</i>

<i>Sorry, yeah,
it's the door, door.</i>

<i>I...</i>

<i>Okay. All right, all right,
all right, all right.</i>

<i>I'm not moving.</i>

<i>Oh, no, no, no. Come on.</i>

<i>No, no, no.</i>

<i>Come on... come on. Ah, shh.</i>

<i>What is wrong with you?
Come on, let's go!</i>

<i>Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.</i>

<i>â™ª And move â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Across the plains â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And send â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Send the letters â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª From all â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The places you've been â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And if I had my way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'd drive on all day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And cross
the prettiest plains â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª From state on to state â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And if I had the time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'd drive on all night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What you get
ain't always what you earn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You give love
but get none in return, no â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Some get lessons
but they never learn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Some are dropped by a fire
but they never burn, no â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You give love
and you shall receive â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Never take more
than you need, no â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Make more love
and plant more seeds â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You know,
roots become branches â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Therefore plant more trees
Yeah â™ª</i>

<i>Okay, how about, uh...
we go analog, huh?</i>

<i>- Little doo-doo-doo.
There's a...</i>

<i>There's a warm-up round
before AJ's?</i>

<i>You guys, I got this for Nari
for her birthday</i>

<i>because I guess
I'm trying to compensate.</i>

<i>Rolling on the floor
laughing my ass off.</i>

<i>All right. Um, uh...</i>

<i>Hi, MTV.
My name is Kendra.</i>

<i>I live in Malibu.
I'm into blank</i>

<i>and I love to have a good time.</i>

<i>Okay, Matias, do you wanna
go first and then...</i>

<i>- Matias.
Hi, my name is Kendra.</i>

<i>I'm from Malibu.</i>

<i>I'm into having sex
on top of a pizza</i>

<i>and I love having
a really good time.</i>

<i>Hi, my name is Kendra.
I'm from Malibu.</i>

<i>I'm really into
the systematic destruction</i>

<i>of an entire people
and their way of life...</i>

<i>...and I'm ready
to have a good time.</i>

<i>Uh, hi, my name is Kendra.</i>

<i>I'm, uh, from Malibu,</i>

<i>and I'm into snorting coke off
a clown's boner and...</i>

<i>- What?
...I love having a good time.</i>

<i>Matias, I can see the pores
on your face.</i>

<i>- What is going on over there?
But like in a good way.</i>

<i>That actually looks like you're
calling from the year 2018.</i>

<i>I mean, it's a full
30 frames a second.</i>

<i>I don't think
you're ready for this.</i>

<i>Oh, my God, and stereo even.</i>

<i>I got a new laptop.</i>

<i>What, actually new?</i>

<i>Eh, it's, like, newish, yeah.</i>

<i>- Yeah, Craigslist.
Ow, ow!</i>

<i>But unfortunately, like, everyone now, 'cause
they can see what he really looks like,</i>

<i>everyone on Facebook's just
like, blup, unfriending him.</i>

<i>Oi, so what? Are you guys gonna
come over or what?</i>

<i>Um, we were gonna come over</i>

<i>- but then, um...
No!</i>

<i>...I started having
some severe...</i>

<i>- No!
...heartburn and...</i>

<i>I told you
he was gonna do this.</i>

<i>I never bail when it's
at one of yours.</i>

<i>Lexx, come on,
help me out here.</i>

<i>I mean, I'm cool with Skyping.</i>

<i>It's subway and bus
from my place, so I'm...</i>

<i>Skype clearly works for me...</i>

<i>You guys are so old.</i>

<i>AJ, it's... AJ, it's 3:00
in the morning in London.</i>

<i>Damon stayed up just for you.</i>

<i>Oh, come on, guys, guys,</i>

<i>I got chips and I've got dips</i>

<i>and I, uh,</i>

<i>I got some killer...</i>

<i>I got some killer buds.</i>

<i>Some what? Say that louder.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>What? What?</i>

<i>I got some killer bud.</i>

<i>Yeah, I know. I heard you. I
just wanted Linda to hear, too.</i>

<i>She's not gonna...</i>

<i>She still thinks marijuana
is illegal here.</i>

<i>Uh, and also, Serena, hello,</i>

<i>I sliced you a rabbit bowl.</i>

<i>Really?</i>

<i>And third, guys, how many times
do I have to tell you?</i>

<i>It is not just the government.</i>

<i>It is the circadians
and the Bilderbergs</i>

<i>and the Illuminati
and corporations.</i>

<i>Why do you think Facebook
and Twitter are free?</i>

<i>- Because you're the product.
'Cause we're the product.</i>

<i>Yes! They own
every single thing you post!</i>

<i>And everybody assumes that,</i>

<i>"Oh, it's just...
it's just pictures and shit."</i>

<i>All they really care about
is targeted marketing.</i>

<i>But the Internet,
as you know it,</i>

<i>is just the surface.
You guys are just like...</i>

<i>Oh, you just float
around up there</i>

<i>without a care in the world
but it is a...</i>

<i>It is a...
it is a deep goddamn ocean</i>

<i>and there are sharks
swimming below you.</i>

<i>They're just gonna...
They're gonna come in</i>

<i>from right up behind you when
you don't even see it coming,</i>

<i>and they're just... Hello?!</i>

<i>No, no, I'm here.
I mean, keep going.</i>

<i>Well, they're gonna come,
they're gonna get you,</i>

<i>and then it's just sayonara,
you know.</i>

<i>It's... That's it!</i>

<i>It's not just sharks
down there, guys.</i>

<i>There are leviathans
and krakens and colossuses.</i>

<i>Um, right, I believe the proper
plural is "colossi", mate.</i>

<i>You know what,
Google "Skyhook," okay?</i>

<i>You will shit yourself.</i>

<i>It is total integration</i>

<i>of Wi-Fi and cell towers,</i>

<i>GPS, IP address detection,</i>

<i>Bluetooth device tracking,</i>

<i>even those Fitbit things</i>

<i>you like to run around with,</i>

<i>they can track you
through that.</i>

<i>What are you doing, Lexx?</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Stop it. That's not funny.</i>

<i>Well played. Well played.</i>

<i>It's not funny, Serena.</i>

<i>Help me!</i>

<i>I just want to...</i>

<i>...get it through your heads!</i>

<i>Oh.</i>

<i>Someday.</i>

<i>Someday what?</i>

<i>You hope we get eaten?</i>

<i>No, actually,
I really hope you don't.</i>

<i>Aw, you're worried!</i>

<i>Like a big, ol' cuddly
teddy bear, huh?</i>

<i>Yeah, a teddy bear
in a survivalist bunker</i>

<i>with a year's supply
of food, guns and ammo.</i>

<i>Oh.</i>

<i>No! No!</i>

<i>No...</i>

<i>- What was that?
That was my...</i>

<i>That's my impression of Nari
being attacked by a dick.</i>

<i>Oh, right.</i>

<i>Yes. Aw!</i>

<i>â™ª Nari â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wanna get in your cary â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Because you make me
feel naughty â™ª</i>

<i>- Oh, my God.
â™ª When you're around â™ª</i>

<i>Is no one offended by...</i>

<i>â™ª Nari â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You drive a hybrid â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wanna get my bit â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª In between you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But then there's â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Serena â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Who comes in â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With her devil horns â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Serena... â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wanna piece of you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Piece of... â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Gonna get my freak on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Gonna get my freak on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Tonight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm gonna get my freak on â™ª</i>

<i>Oh, wait, oh, wait!
Oh, wait! Uh, hold on.</i>

<i>I'm gonna play it now, okay?
Check it out.</i>

<i>I just got these new speakers.</i>

<i>Turn it down!</i>

<i>- AJ, turn it down!
All right. All right.</i>

<i>All right. All right.
Hold on, hold on. Hold on.</i>

<i>You guys see that, though?
Look at my new box.</i>

<i>Bam! Bam!</i>

<i>Bam! Yeah, right?</i>

<i>You would love the way your
shit sounds up close, Lexx,</i>

<i>or you would if you were
comin' over but you're not.</i>

<i>I can't. Subway and bus
from my place, remember that?</i>

<i>Before we start,
there is something</i>

<i>that we wanna tell you guys.</i>

<i>- Oh, wait, wait, wait!
Ooh.</i>

<i>Should we wait for Amaya?</i>

<i>I don't think Amaya's
gonna be comin'.</i>

<i>- Bam!
Oh, yeah!</i>

<i>Bam!</i>

<i>Bam!</i>

<i>- That is amazing.
Can I... Can I see it?</i>

<i>- Closer. Closer.
Closer, closer, closer!</i>

<i>I wanna see it.</i>

<i>- Oh, it's great.
Wow!</i>

<i>I am so happy for you guys.</i>

<i>- She asked me.
Okay, no, no, no, no, wait,</i>

<i>you gotta tell us everything.</i>

<i>I was having my morning cup
of inspirational tea</i>

<i>and I swig back
the little last bit of it.</i>

<i>Basically,
I almost choke on this</i>

<i>because it was in the cup.</i>

<i>Were you just watching her
drink it the whole time,</i>

<i>just going like,
"She's gonna find it soon."</i>

<i>Well, yeah. But... she puts
milk in her tea, you know.</i>

<i>- So it's like cloudy.
Awesome, guys.</i>

<i>It's my mom's ring.</i>

<i>- It's your mom's ring?
Aw! That's, aw, that's...</i>

<i>Oh, my God!
Did you... Wait, did you, uh,</i>

<i>did you ask Nari's dad for
permission and did you film it?</i>

<i>Please say you did because
oh, my God, I just...</i>

<i>I loved the look on his face
when he found out</i>

<i>that you two weren't,
uh, roommates and I just...</i>

<i>I would really
love to see that.</i>

<i>AJ, it's not the time.</i>

<i>It was cool when you
stood up to him,</i>

<i>that's all I'm sayin'.
It was just sweet.</i>

<i>Serena, is your...
Is your mom excited?</i>

<i>- Yeah, she's really excited.
Cool.</i>

<i>I just, um...
You know...</i>

<i>Uh, the cancer has progressed,
so it's...</i>

<i>It's... um,</i>

<i>it's moved
into her brain and,</i>

<i>uh, they have her
on life support, though,</i>

<i>and they're really trying
some aggressive treatment,</i>

<i>so it's...</i>

<i>I wish I'd asked her sooner</i>

<i>so we just had more time,
you know.</i>

<i>I remember when
I had to put my dog down.</i>

<i>Oh, my God.
You're so bad at this.</i>

<i>I am so... No, I am so thrilled
for you guys, you have no idea.</i>

<i>I always thought Matias and
Amaya would be the first to...</i>

<i>Nice recovery, mate,
but still it sucks.</i>

<i>Well, oh!
And hey, um, by the way,</i>

<i>by the way...
â™ª Ha, ha, ha â™ª</i>

<i>What is that sound?</i>

<i>Universal Life Church,</i>

<i>fully certified,
took five minutes online,</i>

<i>I can totally marry you guys,
that's right.</i>

<i>That says "wedding officiant"?</i>

<i>- Yep.
Yeah, there's nothing</i>

<i>more romantic
than being married</i>

<i>by the last guy
you ever slept with.</i>

<i>Uh, that is the only guy, Lexx.</i>

<i>Nari?</i>

<i>Ooh!</i>

<i>Nari?</i>

<i>Nari...</i>

<i>â™ª Take me down â™ª</i>

<i>No, no.</i>

<i>- â™ª Take me down â™ª
No.</i>

<i>â™ª To the bank
beside the river â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I need a little rainfall â™ª</i>

<i>This is Amaya's
favorite sunset spot.</i>

<i>â™ª Everything is so loud â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Constant ringing
in my ears â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I don't wanna be â™ª</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>â™ª Without you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And don't you
worry anymore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We've had these
trying times before â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You know it will be okay â™ª</i>

<i>Hi.</i>

<i>Look, I know... I know you're mad
at me, and I know, we've both...</i>

<i>we've both been busy,
but I feel like...</i>

<i>I know, I... I've been spending</i>

<i>a lot of time on this app,</i>

<i>but I've been doing it</i>

<i>so that we can...</i>

<i>So that we can
communicate better.</i>

<i>Amaya.</i>

<i>I went... I went
to the ASL class, uh...</i>

<i>No. No, I'm just, uh...</i>

<i>Uh, Amaya!</i>

<i>Damn it.</i>

<i>Hey, guys,
I'm gonna head out real quick.</i>

<i>Uh, what's up?
Where are you going?</i>

<i>Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'll explain later.</i>

<i>All right. Bye then.</i>

<i>Is everything okay, Matias?</i>

<i>Uh, sometimes that guy.</i>

<i>I believe in the truth
and Damon believes in the lies.</i>

<i>Damon believes
in the hard lies</i>

<i>and I believe
in the crazy truth.</i>

<i>All right.
No, no, it's not impossible,</i>

<i>it's just...
it is improbable, but...</i>

<i>Thank you, Captain Spock.</i>

<i>Uh, that is Ambassador Spock.</i>

<i>And we are nothing
without our chain of command.</i>

<i>Hah, you're such a nerd, dude.</i>

<i>Hey, what the hell?</i>

<i>Sounds like someone
is meditating or something.</i>

<i>Matias, are you okay?</i>

<i>I thought you
were going somewhere.</i>

<i>What's goin' on?</i>

<i>Mate, Matias, what's going on?</i>

<i>Do you wanna share...
share your screen, mate?</i>

<i>Whoa! That looks like the
wallpaper's actually moving.</i>

<i>Yeah, it is.
It switched when I connected.</i>

<i>Connected to what?</i>

<i>I, uh, I have no idea,
this river thing.</i>

<i>All right.
That's an overlay network.</i>

<i>You've been bouncing it
everywhere.</i>

<i>- What's an overlay network?
Uh, hey, Damon,</i>

<i>Damon, you gotta
translate that, man.</i>

<i>Oh, um, sorry, uh,</i>

<i>it's so no one can track you.</i>

<i>Shit! This is...</i>

<i>- Dude, this is darknet.
Yeah, probably.</i>

<i>- Damon, what's darknet?
Uh, it is part of the Internet</i>

<i>that isn't or can't be
indexed by a search engine.</i>

<i>It's where you find marketplaces
for bad shit, basically,</i>

<i>like, um, Silk Road.
Damon, you know about that.</i>

<i>It was all about drugs,
illegal IDs,</i>

<i>stolen credit cards, exploits,</i>

<i>even assassination for hire.</i>

<i>Lolita City,
which is all about child porn</i>

<i>- and, like, fan fiction...
Okay, AJ, we got it.</i>

<i>- Yeah, definitely... yeah.
Yeah, maybe you should</i>

<i>just leave whatever
that is alone, Matias.</i>

<i>Oh, whoa! Okay.</i>

<i>It looks like
an old-school PBS.</i>

<i>Charon is the ferryman
of the dead.</i>

<i>"The ferryman of Hades
who carries souls</i>

<i>of the newly deceased
across the river Styx..."</i>

<i>Styx, sorry.</i>

<i>"...and Acheron that divides</i>

<i>the world of the living
from the world of the dead."</i>

<i>Dude, whose computer
did you buy?</i>

<i>I didn't... I didn't buy it. I...</i>

<i>There's, um, there's a cyber
cafe that I've been...</i>

<i>that I've been working at
and I... I don't know,</i>

<i>and I noticed this computer</i>

<i>was sitting in the lost
and found for the last,</i>

<i>I don't know, three or...
three or four weeks.</i>

<i>Wait, well, hang on,
you stole someone's computer?</i>

<i>No, I didn't...
I didn't steal it, I just...</i>

<i>Hold on, mate. You told me
you bought it on Craigslist.</i>

<i>I felt like shit
the moment I took it.</i>

<i>I don't know
what I was hoping for.</i>

<i>I just... I kept having
to go there</i>

<i>because I wanted a better
computer to work on my app with</i>

<i>and then my thing was just
moving so goddamn slow</i>

<i>that I thought whoever's
laptop this was, I mean...</i>

<i>But look here, look,
when I... I went on Facebook,</i>

<i>all of this stuff auto-filled.</i>

<i>Norah C. IV, oh!</i>

<i>Pretentious twat.</i>

<i>Only an elitist asshat
would have that kind of name.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah, okay,
Alistair Jeffcock.</i>

<i>Hey, Jeffcock
is a family name, Lexx.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

<i>It's a fake name.</i>

<i>Guys, it's "Charon" backwards.</i>

<i>Charon IV, Charon IV, yeah.</i>

<i>He's one of them.
He's one of them,</i>

<i>and whoever they are,
they must...</i>

<i>This is where they meet up
to trade.</i>

<i>Trade what?</i>

<i>Well, one of them
was actually sending me</i>

<i>private messages earlier.</i>

<i>It was, uh, Charon68.</i>

<i>Oh, the poor schmuck
never made it to 69.</i>

<i>Yeah, here.</i>

<i>"Just processed the transfer.
You'll have it soon."</i>

<i>It's like he's placing an order for
something he already paid for.</i>

<i>Matias, go back
to the beginning.</i>

<i>Well, the computer
was acting strangely,</i>

<i>so I ran a Disk Utility
and it said</i>

<i>the drive was full, so...</i>

<i>I was lookin' around
and I found this, uh,</i>

<i>this folder, right?
It was...</i>

<i>hidden, invisible,
and it's got videos.</i>

<i>- Nine hundred and sixty gig...
Show us.</i>

<i>No, wait, wait, wait.
Look at those addresses.</i>

<i>That's here, that's...</i>

<i>the ones on the east side,
and...</i>

<i>I think it's okay.</i>

<i>- He's been wardriving.
Totally.</i>

<i>- Translate, guys.
Um, okay, hackers drive</i>

<i>through neighborhoods,
trying to scoop out</i>

<i>Wi-Fi addresses
of any unsecured</i>

<i>or vulnerable routers
so they can...</i>

<i>Hackers can activate
the camera on laptops</i>

<i>and phones and disable
the indicator lights</i>

<i>so you wouldn't even know
that they were on.</i>

<i>- Oh!
Even the director of the FBI</i>

<i>- says he keeps his covered.
Yeah, so think about that</i>

<i>next time you're servicing
your porn addiction, AJ.</i>

<i>- So this guy's good.
Yeah, this takes mad skills.</i>

<i>He might be a goddamn maestro.</i>

<i>Oh, more like a goddamn psycho.</i>

<i>- Yeah.
Hey, did you open that link</i>

<i>in the folder,
the one called "Account?"</i>

<i>Wait, that... that's just
from a couple of minutes ago.</i>

<i>Bitcoin, that's not
a real currency, right?</i>

<i>It's cryptocurrency.
No middleman, no banks.</i>

<i>It's 10 million.</i>

<i>That's $10 million, guys.</i>

<i>Whoa, wait,
this is a joke, right?</i>

<i>Um, dude, are you... Are you
being serious right now or...</i>

<i>All right, the exchange rate
right now is 663.02</i>

<i>per XPT</i>

<i>- times 16,263.52.
Yep.</i>

<i>- Yep.
Ten million change.</i>

<i>Yep, 10 million.</i>

<i>- Do you see that?
It's almost 11.</i>

<i>Free money
just sitting there.</i>

<i>No, no, there's no such thing
as free money, AJ.</i>

<i>I hate to burst your bubble.</i>

<i>He's talking about the money.</i>

<i>Then say something.</i>

<i>Wait, wait, don't...</i>

<i>Type, uh, "For what?"</i>

<i>Hello, hair.
He's talking about hair.</i>

<i>AJ, for once in your life,
just put a cork in it.</i>

<i>Method... what's he...</i>

<i>What is that?</i>

<i>"A surgical procedure
in which a hole is...</i>

<i>drilled into the skull."</i>

<i>Oh, my God, this is...</i>

<i>Oh, shit!</i>

<i>Oh, my God!</i>

<i>Oh!</i>

<i>No, no, no, no, Matias!</i>

<i>- Matias!
Just shut it off!</i>

<i>Matias, shut it off!</i>

<i>All right, all right,
all right!</i>

<i>That's him, isn't it?</i>

<i>Don't answer.</i>

<i>Contributions?</i>

<i>Charon 68,
the first thing he wrote</i>

<i>was that he liked
the last contribution.</i>

<i>Um, go back to the video folder</i>

<i>and scroll all the way
to the bottom.</i>

<i>Just go all the way down.</i>

<i>No, Matias,
don't open it, please.</i>

<i>- Just...
No, just open.</i>

<i>No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, I don't...</i>

<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>Uh, no, no, no, no, okay.</i>

<i>- No, I can't... I can't...
Oh, God.</i>

<i>Out of this one,
out of this one.</i>

<i>I can't watch that.</i>

<i>Okay, these are
custom videos, these are...</i>

<i>Guys, that's what
they're trading.</i>

<i>AJ, I don't...
I don't... I don't...</i>

<i>No, no, this is... Okay.</i>

<i>Show me the most recent one.</i>

<i>Nari.</i>

<i>The last one,
it's a small file.</i>

<i>It's smaller
than the other ones.</i>

<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

<i>Just open it.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Wait, wait, stop.</i>

<i>This can't be real.</i>

<i>Matias, go to the end.</i>

<i>Go all the way to the end.</i>

<i>Why is he looking
at the camera?</i>

<i>- That was it, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

<i>Well, then he might not
have her yet.</i>

<i>She's still in her bedroom,</i>

<i>all the other girls weren't.</i>

<i>Look, he chooses a girl,</i>

<i>shows her to the rest
of the group,</i>

<i>and waits for someone to pay.</i>

<i>And someone just paid,
so this is...</i>

<i>- this is the next girl.
We have to report this, Nari.</i>

<i>Oh, we have her address
so just we can do</i>

<i>- a reverse phone look-up?
Guys, I'll be right back,</i>

<i>- I'll be right back.
Matias!</i>

<i>Matias, I'm not...</i>

<i>Look, please, I'm not...
No,</i>

<i>please just give me
one second.</i>

<i>Hello, hello!</i>

<i>Hello!</i>

<i>Kelly?</i>

<i>Kelly!</i>

<i>Kelly!</i>

<i>Hey! Hey, hold on, one second.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Uh, yeah, we did.</i>

<i>Okay. Well,</i>

<i>he must have figured it out
'cause we got him.</i>

<i>Yeah, sure thing.</i>

<i>Thanks.</i>

<i>Sorry, that was
the pizza place.</i>

<i>I guess the driver called,
couldn't figure out</i>

<i>where we were or something,
I don't know. Hi!</i>

<i>- Is, um, is Amaya with you right now?
No.</i>

<i>I mean, I just got in,</i>

<i>and I think Amaya's
in the shower.</i>

<i>Well, can you possibly get her
for me right now?</i>

<i>- Oh, wow! What?
Uh...</i>

<i>- Okay, are you there?
Hello, hello?</i>

<i>I can hear you.
Are you still there?</i>

<i>- I just can't...
Kelly, I can't see you.</i>

<i>- I can't see you.
Uh, where'd you go?</i>

<i>- Hold on a second.
Yeah, is that</i>

<i>- on your end or...
No, I think it's my end.</i>

<i>Yeah, sorry, hold on.</i>

<i>God! God! Kelly!</i>

<i>Kelly!</i>

<i>Kelly!</i>

<i>Kelly!</i>

<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya,</i>

<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya!</i>

<i>Hey! Come here, come here!</i>

<i>Can you see...</i>

<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya!</i>

<i>Don't go in there,
don't go in there,</i>

<i>don't go in there,
don't go... don't...</i>

<i>stop, stop, stop!</i>

<i>Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.</i>

<i>Come here, come here,
come here.</i>

<i>Come here, come here.
Good, good.</i>

<i>Shit. I... it must...
it must be a bug,</i>

<i>or something.
Your computer called mine.</i>

<i>Um, uh, Kelly, Kelly's, um,</i>

<i>She's... she brought a...
she brought a guy home.</i>

<i>He's... she's... don't, don't,</i>

<i>don't disconnect.</i>

<i>I'll wait for you.
I'll wait... I'll wait for you.</i>

<i>Hey!</i>

<i>Hey!</i>

<i>Can you please sit down?</i>

<i>Please, please, just please
don't hurt her.</i>

<i>I'll do anything
you want me to do,</i>

<i>I will do anything, I promise.</i>

<i>How are you doing that?</i>

<i>How can I give... I can't give
you the laptop if I can't...</i>

<i>Wait just one second,
could you wait?</i>

God.

<i>Okay. Be calm. Just be...</i>

<i>Matias, Matias, Matias,
Matias, okay.</i>

<i>Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, I'm here, I'm here,</i>

<i>- I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
Listen, here's the plan, okay?</i>

<i>Nari is going to meet you down
at the police station,</i>

<i>there's one that's half
a mile away from your place.</i>

<i>You need to bring the laptop
with you, because every...</i>

<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait,
where's Damon? Where's Damon?</i>

<i>No, no, no, no, we need...
we need Damon.</i>

<i>- Damon! Damon! We need Damon!
What? Matias!</i>

<i>- We need Damon right now! Damon!
I'm sorry!</i>

<i>- Have we called the police or what?
No, we're not calling police.</i>

<i>We're going to the police,
okay? Matias...</i>

<i>We don't have a lot of time, okay?
We need to help this girl.</i>

<i>- Matias!
Yeah.</i>

<i>- I know there's a lot going on, okay?
Uh-hmm.</i>

<i>But you need to trust us,
and you need to move fast.</i>

<i>Get the laptop,
go down to the police station.</i>

<i>- I will be there, okay?
No.</i>

<i>- I have a friend that will meet us.
We can't.</i>

<i>He knows how to deal
with this kind of situation!</i>

<i>- Yes! Yes, yes, yes, you can.
No, we can't... we can't...</i>

<i>It's not... it's not real.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>It's, um...</i>

<i>It's a... it's a game.</i>

<i>I made the whole thing up.</i>

<i>It's a game.</i>

<i>Lexx, you were... You were totally
onto me from the beginning.</i>

<i>Wait, I'm confused.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Yeah, it's, um, it's a game.</i>

<i>It's my game. It's the one
I've been working on.</i>

<i>Damon, Damon knows.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, I'm lost.
I what now?</i>

<i>I told you I was... I told you
I was writing something.</i>

<i>- Matias, I'm...
Uh, yeah, man, you said</i>

<i>you're writing something,
you didn't say playtesting</i>

<i>- or implementing.
Well, yeah, I wanted to be...</i>

<i>I wanted to get an actual
response out of you, you know.</i>

<i>I mean, if you... If you knew what was
coming, then it wouldn't feel real.</i>

<i>That way I could, you know, I could
tell if it actually could work.</i>

<i>It is game night.</i>

<i>- Holy shit, man!
Asshole.</i>

<i>- Oh, my God!
I guess that means it was pretty good, huh?</i>

<i>Matias, this is not funny.</i>

<i>It's... actually, it's not,
it's not supposed to be funny.</i>

<i>- It's actually, uh, it's a horror transmedia.
Oh, holy shit... It's an ARG.</i>

<i>- It's an alternate reality game.
Exactly, yeah.</i>

<i>It's a... it's a test of what you would
do if the experience actually happened.</i>

<i>- Wow!
Wow. That was bloody...</i>

<i>- Wait, AJ, were you in on this?
Hell no!</i>

<i>I had no...
I had no idea about this.</i>

<i>Where... dude, where'd you...
Where'd you get those videos?</i>

<i>- That is some dark shit.
Yeah.</i>

<i>Yeah, I know, I know,
it's just horror films.</i>

<i>What... hah! Okay, well,
you must have dug into some</i>

<i>really obscure shit,
because I have seen everything</i>

<i>and I haven't seen any
of those videos that you...</i>

<i>What if we'd called
the police?</i>

<i>Well, ideally you would...
you would register to play</i>

<i>with your cell number,
so if, you know,</i>

<i>by the time you logged in,
if you called 911,</i>

<i>it would hack your phone
and you would get a recording</i>

<i>like the bad guy hacked
into the phone.</i>

<i>Wow!</i>

<i>That, you know, it's crazy.</i>

<i>- Phew!
Wait, the...</i>

<i>I went to that ASL class,</i>

<i>or the... or the...
or the first one,</i>

<i>the first one, at least.</i>

<i>And then... and the guy,</i>

<i>he was... he was...
he was teaching the class,</i>

<i>he was talking about</i>

<i>how hard it was
for a hearing-impaired person</i>

<i>to have a meaningful
relationship with someone</i>

<i>who couldn't sign.</i>

<i>And then... and how it builds
this special bond,</i>

<i>the ability to communicate
with someone</i>

<i>in a... in a special way
that would...</i>

<i>And you're right.</i>

<i>I'm really fucking scared,
Amaya.</i>

<i>I mean, I've never cared</i>

<i>about anyone or anything</i>

<i>the way I care about you.</i>

<i>The night we met at the bar,</i>

<i>I...</i>

<i>the music was so loud, and...</i>

<i>I saw you
and I remember thinking...</i>

<i>Oh, why bother?</i>

<i>That a beautiful person</i>

<i>wouldn't be able
to hear you anyway,</i>

<i>it's so loud.</i>

<i>I didn't know you were deaf.</i>

<i>I didn't know</i>

<i>that all that noise
wouldn't matter.</i>

<i>I mean,
that's what I want for us.</i>

<i>I want nothing else to matter.</i>

<i>I want nothing
to be in the way</i>

<i>of how much I love you.</i>

<i>I need you
to come here, okay?</i>

<i>I need you to get here
as fast as you can, okay?</i>

<i>Take the subway, okay?</i>

<i>Matias, what was
with them Roman numerals?</i>

<i>- Like, why the Roman numerals?
Oh, yeah.</i>

<i>- What do you mean?
That's weird.</i>

<i>Well, in the game,
instead of Charon's</i>

<i>just like being like a,
you know, Charon 4,</i>

<i>like the number four,
it had an IV.</i>

<i>And what about the girl
in the video,</i>

<i>the one who was next?</i>

<i>What about her?</i>

<i>Where'd you get the video?</i>

<i>Sorry, guys.
I got to take this.</i>

<i>It's the... it's the
Puppet Masters.</i>

<i>- No problem.
Mute your mic, Lexx.</i>

<i>- Yeah.
Mama!</i>

<i>Lexx, mute your mic!</i>

<i>- Oh, my God.
She does this every time.</i>

<i>Yeah, you are louder than her.</i>

<i>Oh, my God. Mama.</i>

<i>I love how loud she is
on the phone to her mother.</i>

<i>It's just like,
straight up, like, bam.</i>

<i>I know.</i>

<i>You guys,
we do not have to play a game.</i>

<i>Let's just chat.
Let's just hang out,</i>

<i>and, um, you know,
what if... you guys,</i>

<i>maybe we should do
a guided meditation together.</i>

<i>Um, no.</i>

<i>I really did think
that was real for a second.</i>

<i>I'm gonna be honest.
I was totally there.</i>

<i>That was the most fun I've had,
in, like, two years.</i>

<i>Ugh. Good one.</i>

<i>Matias, Matias.</i>

<i>I have more questions, man.</i>

<i>Yeah, here,
I'm sorry. What's up?</i>

<i>Is it better, like,
that we did it as a team,</i>

<i>or as a solo experience?</i>

<i>And also...
and like how the hell</i>

<i>are you handling
the decision tree?</i>

<i>Like, say, if we had decided</i>

<i>to do something
with the bad guy's money,</i>

<i>if we'd taken it,
then how does that ripple</i>

<i>through the rest of the story?</i>

<i>Hello? Matia...</i>

<i>Oh, bloody hell,
he's away with the fairies.</i>

<i>- Matias!
Hold on, I'll be...</i>

<i>I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.</i>

<i>How long are you
gonna be gone this time?</i>

<i>Are you there?</i>

<i>Are you there?
Can you hear me...</i>

<i>Hear me?</i>

<i>Good.</i>

<i>Then watch this.</i>

<i>You get the computer back</i>

<i>when I get Amaya back.</i>

<i>You get the money back
when I see on the news</i>

<i>that Erica Dunne is back home
safe with her parents.</i>

<i>You stupid motherfucker.</i>

<i>- All I want is my laptop.
All I want is Amaya.</i>

<i>You don't understand</i>

<i>what you have gotten
yourself into.</i>

<i>- You killed Kelly!
No, I didn't.</i>

<i>If you lay a hand
on Amaya or Erica,</i>

<i>you'll never see
any of that money.</i>

<i>Shut the fuck up and listen.</i>

<i>- They do not let girls go.
What are you talking about?</i>

<i>The Circle,
the people I work with,</i>

<i>all the other Charon clients,</i>

<i>they monitor
all Bitcoin accounts.</i>

<i>They're gonna think
I'm trying to cash out.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Hello, hello!</i>

<i>I lost your screen.
What's going on?</i>

<i>- What's happening?
I don't... I don't know.</i>

<i>Oh, God, they pulled you
across the river, didn't they?</i>

<i>Hey, you know what?
I'm just... I'm gonna close it.</i>

<i>No!
Do not close it.</i>

<i>They're gonna know
you're not me.</i>

<i>Are they talking to you?</i>

<i>What are they saying?</i>

<i>They're saying...
they're saying recite the code.</i>

<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>You just put a bullet
in our head.</i>

<i>You stupid... Okay.</i>

<i>Listen to me.</i>

<i>If they find out</i>

<i>that I lost that computer, they're
gonna kill me, they're gonna kill you,</i>

<i>and they're gonna kill anyone
else that might have seen it.</i>

<i>Just give me the code then.</i>

<i>Give me the money
back first and then...</i>

<i>No. Fuck you!</i>

<i>I am 10 feet away from Amaya,</i>

<i>and I will put a knife
in her throat</i>

<i>and disappear before
she even hits the ground.</i>

<i>I think you're a dead man
who lost $10 million.</i>

<i>This can be so easy.</i>

<i>I return Amaya,
you return the laptop,</i>

<i>and it'll be like nothing
ever happened.</i>

<i>No, you killed Kelly!</i>

<i>No, I didn't.
I just bashed her head.</i>

<i>She'll wake up and think
it was a robbery or something.</i>

<i>We have no time for this.</i>

<i>Return the money.</i>

<i>No, no, no. No, no, no. No.</i>

<i>When Erica Dunne is home safe,</i>

<i>then you get the money.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>You better hurry up.</i>

<i>They said this is
your last chance, Charon IV.</i>

<i>Okay, okay.</i>

<i>Type A-B-Y-S-S-U-S.</i>

<i>Second word:
A-B-Y-S-S-U-M.</i>

<i>Third word:
I-N-V-O-C-A-T.</i>

<i>Oh, wait, they're typing
in all caps.</i>

<i>- Should it be in all caps?
Just fucking send it.</i>

<i>Okay. All right.</i>

<i>They're asking
why you drained the account.</i>

<i>Tell them I switched
from Bitcoin to Ethereum.</i>

<i>They're asking why.</i>

<i>It's a better exchange rate.</i>

<i>I got a tip.</i>

<i>Are they buying it?</i>

<i>Yeah, think so.</i>

<i>We'll be there soon,
you'll get Amaya.</i>

<i>And you'll get your laptop.</i>

<i>If I let Erica go,</i>

<i>they're gonna think
that she escaped and...</i>

<i>they're gonna lose faith,
they're gonna hold me liable.</i>

<i>Yeah, but you'll have
$10 million</i>

<i>to help you figure out
how to disappear.</i>

<i>If anything goes wrong
between here and there,</i>

<i>you're both dead.</i>

<i>He's lying to us.</i>

<i>He's back. Matias.</i>

<i>Yo. What?</i>

<i>- Okay, Nari, it is just a game.
I found her. Okay?</i>

<i>- I found the girl, Matias, from your video.
Found who?</i>

<i>She's real.
Her name's Erica Dunne.</i>

<i>She is real,
and she's really missing.</i>

<i>No, Nari, I know, I know.
I just... That was a...</i>

<i>Is it... Is it just
a placeholder or like...</i>

<i>Yeah. No, it is, it is,
it's a placeholder.</i>

<i>Dude, that's messed up, man.</i>

<i>Where did you even
get the video?</i>

<i>LiveLeak.</i>

<i>Yeah, someone on the inside</i>

<i>just must have...
must have leaked it</i>

<i>or something. I don't know.</i>

<i>Why would you use that video?</i>

<i>Okay, you know what?
Send the link.</i>

<i>Nari, that's ridiculous.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Who's that?</i>

<i>Is that... Is that Amaya?</i>

<i>Turn on your video, love.</i>

<i>- Matias?
No, no, no. Get him off.</i>

<i>- Matias, is that you?
How do we get this person off?</i>

<i>Does anyone know
how we get this person off?</i>

<i>- Stop it.
Wait, what's going on?</i>

<i>Come on, Matias.</i>

<i>Are you... you sneaky
little bastard.</i>

<i>He's playing us.
It's still the game.</i>

<i>No. No, guys, do... hey,
listen, do not click the link.</i>

<i>- Is this the link?
Do not click the link.</i>

<i>Do you hear me?</i>

<i>Guys,
we didn't click the link,</i>

<i>but the video's playing anyway.</i>

<i>Same here.</i>

<i>- What the...
What is it?</i>

<i>That was senior year.
That's December.</i>

<i>That's actually
McLeary's Pub, yeah?</i>

<i>- This is so cool.
What does this have</i>

<i>- to do with the...
I don't know.</i>

<i>Wait, guys,
where is Lexx?</i>

<i>She's probably still getting
a bollocking from her mom.</i>

<i>Lexx!</i>

<i>- What is that?
That's Drill Bit.</i>

<i>- That's an exploit.
What is an exploit?</i>

<i>It's a hacking tool.</i>

<i>Lexx!</i>

<i>Weird.</i>

<i>Are you calling Lexx
right now?</i>

<i>Yes,
I'm calling Lexx right now.</i>

<i>Wait, wait,
I thought she was...</i>

<i>Where is she?</i>

<i>Okay, I am lo...</i>

<i>Is she in on this, Matias?
What's going on?</i>

<i>Is that the German place?</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>Did she just jump?</i>

<i>Oh, my God! Help!</i>

<i>Matias?</i>

<i>Was that Lexx?</i>

<i>Jeez.</i>

<i>Matias, please, talk to us.</i>

<i>This is just...
This is the game.</i>

<i>That wasn't her.</i>

<i>Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, how close are you?</i>

<i>How close... how close
are you to the subway?</i>

<i>Okay, okay, can you...
Can you do me a favor?</i>

<i>Can you... Can you stay
on the call?</i>

<i>And just keep your...
keep your phone in your pocket,</i>

<i>or whatever,
just stay on, okay?</i>

<i>Just trust me, okay?</i>

<i>And when you...
and I'll explain it to you</i>

<i>when you... when you get here,
all right?</i>

<i>Wait, no.
Nari, Nari, Nari, Nari,</i>

<i>- who are you calling?
I'm calling Lexx.</i>

<i>Don't. Please,
do not call her right now.</i>

<i>- Okay? Please, just trust...
Straight to voicemail.</i>

<i>Okay, guys. Hey, listen to me
for a second, all right?</i>

<i>No more calls, all right?
We just... you can...</i>

<i>you can leave your phones on,</i>

<i>- but just don't...
Why?</i>

<i>There are automated calls,
it's part of the game.</i>

<i>I just... I just wanna make sure
that they're going through.</i>

<i>Bullshit, Matias.
Bullshit, okay?</i>

<i>- Okay, Nari, Nari.
I have had enough.</i>

<i>I swear, if you don't start
talking now...</i>

<i>Matias is playing with you.</i>

<i>No. No, no,
I am calling the police.</i>

<i>Nari, Nari, please.
Do not do that.</i>

<i>- Please, hang, hang up the phone, Nari.
No, I am not.</i>

<i>- I am gonna call the police right now.
Calm down, guys.</i>

<i>Just give me one more second,
please, just one more second!</i>

<i>Guys, it's real.
The whole thing is real.</i>

<i>Just, just listen to me, all right?
The reason I said it was a game</i>

<i>is because he said if anyone
knew or if anyone disconnected,</i>

<i>- he would kill Amaya and then he'd come after all of you.
Who?</i>

<i>Charon! Charon, Charon IV.
The guy whose laptop I took.</i>

<i>Okay, Matias. We get it.
I'm kind of done with this now.</i>

<i>Just... can you shut up
and listen to me, please?</i>

<i>Please. He can hear
and see everything, all right?</i>

<i>I mean, he, he found
Amaya's apartment.</i>

<i>She was the first person I called, so he
must have been able to track her somehow,</i>

<i>- or, or, or I don't know.
You're serious? You're being serious right now?</i>

<i>She's on her way over here,
and he's following her.</i>

<i>Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
So, so there is no game.</i>

<i>This is all
actually happening?</i>

<i>Oh, my God. He-he killed Lexx.</i>

<i>I... No...
I-I-I don't know.</i>

<i>But he... he pushed her.
He-he-he bloody killed Lexx.</i>

<i>If he was with Amaya, then how
could he have done that to Lexx?</i>

<i>That's exactly the thing.
It wasn't him.</i>

<i>- It must have been one of the others.
The other what?</i>

<i>The other... the Charons.
The ones who buy the videos,</i>

<i>the ones who pick the girls.
They must have figured out</i>

<i>- that the laptop got stolen.
Oh, my God.</i>

<i>Guys, they're not just gonna
let that evidence float around.</i>

<i>So, all those videos,
they're all...</i>

<i>This is damage control.
They're doing a clean-up.</i>

<i>If they found Lexx, can they
find the rest of us, too?</i>

<i>I am ghosted online.
They can't find me.</i>

<i>Okay. He's right, he's right.
You need to get to AJ's house.</i>

<i>No, wait. Do not... No!
If these guys are that good...</i>

<i>they can track cell phones, they can track
cars. Do not lead them to my place.</i>

<i>Just listen to me, guys. You have to stay
online and act like nothing is wrong.</i>

<i>What we can't do is sit around, wait
till someone shows up at our door.</i>

<i>Wait. Wait, wait.</i>

<i>How do we know
he's not listening now?</i>

<i>Because of Facebook chat.
The green light,</i>

<i>it goes off
when she loses connection.</i>

<i>That's why I told her
to take the subway.</i>

<i>So when she'd lose connection
and went underground,</i>

<i>then I could tell you guys what
was fucking happening, all right?</i>

<i>Look, there's no service in the station,
but there's Wi-Fi in the subway cars.</i>

<i>So, as soon as she gets
on that train,</i>

<i>she's gonna have Wi-Fi again,
and so will he.</i>

<i>All right? Let's just...
Can we just... can we just...</i>

<i>Can we just play a game in the meantime,
act like nothing is happening?</i>

<i>- I'll give him the laptop when he gets here.
Wait. If he's watching,</i>

<i>if he saw what happened to
Lexx, then doesn't he know?</i>

<i>I don't... I don't know.
He hasn't said anything yet.</i>

<i>So, uh, so it might have happened
when he didn't have connection or...</i>

<i>Yo, AJ. AJ, AJ, dude,
get the hell out of there.</i>

<i>- Get out. Get out of there.
AJ, get out of there now.</i>

<i>- AJ... AJ, get out!
AJ, get out.</i>

<i>Jesus Christ, Mom,
what are you...</i>

<i>God.</i>

<i>All right, all right, um,
all right, listen.</i>

<i>I transferred all of the money, all of
the money into my account, all right?</i>

<i>- Just temporarily.
Why didn't you tell us?</i>

<i>Why, why didn't you try
and warn us?</i>

<i>How could I have
warned you, Damon?</i>

<i>If I did, Amaya would be...</i>

<i>And I just did it
as insurance, all right?</i>

<i>What, what about the laptop?
Isn't that enough insurance?</i>

<i>He's, he's not gonna hurt
Amaya when you got...</i>

<i>- Not just Amaya.
You've got all his evidence!</i>

<i>Erica Dunne.</i>

<i>I told him he would get
the money back</i>

<i>once I knew
that she was free too.</i>

<i>Oh.</i>

<i>Matty, you are so dead.</i>

<i>What the hell else
was I supposed to do?</i>

<i>You saw what he does
to those people.</i>

<i>What'd you think was gonna
happen? You think he was just</i>

<i>gonna take the laptop
and walk away?</i>

<i>I know what
I'm asking you to do is...</i>

<i>Amaya's gonna be here
in five minutes,</i>

<i>and I can't promise you that
in those five minutes</i>

<i>that no one else is gonna
show up at your door,</i>

<i>but...</i>

<i>Guys, if we don't do this,
Amaya's...</i>

<i>Please.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>So, uh, who wants to go first?</i>

<i>I'll go.</i>

<i>Yeah, well, that one sucks.</i>

<i>Um, my gym teacher got fired</i>

<i>for adding blank</i>

<i>to the obstacle course.</i>

<i>Too much cocaine.</i>

<i>Velcro.</i>

<i>Uh, depression.</i>

<i>I like Velcro.</i>

<i>Thought depression
was pretty good.</i>

<i>All right, I'll go.</i>

<i>Uh, or do you wanna go, Damon?</i>

<i>- Yeah. Yeah, all right.
Yeah? Um, all right.</i>

<i>Um, uh, in his new action,</i>

<i>in his new action comedy,
Jackie Chan must fend off</i>

<i>- ninjas while also...
Hey, uh, Nari.</i>

<i>Uh, Nari, we're, we're,
we're trying to play.</i>

<i>- Uh, uh...
Sorry.</i>

<i>A horse with no legs.</i>

<i>- What, uh, what is...
Right?</i>

<i>Uh, go around...
going around punching people.</i>

<i>- Yeah.
Yeah.</i>

<i>That's... you would pick that.</i>

<i>That's pretty good try.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Matias, give me access
to the laptop.</i>

<i>System Preferences,
Users and Groups,</i>

<i>Add User, make sure you give me
administrative access.</i>

<i>Wait, I'm just...
What are you gonna be doing?</i>

<i>I am gonna back-up
all the videos</i>

<i>and I'm gonna go
through location services,</i>

<i>in case we can find out
where the laptop's been,</i>

<i>then maybe we can find
the missing girl.</i>

<i>Wait, what do you mean?</i>

<i>Are we...
don't worry, okay?</i>

<i>What are you... what... no.</i>

<i>You guys, my friend
on the force,</i>

<i>he's coming over here, so...</i>

<i>Um...</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Um, blank.</i>

<i>Awesome in theory,
kind of a mess in practice.</i>

<i>Um, uh, the swim team,</i>

<i>all at once.</i>

<i>Okay, he's gone.
AJ, AJ, AJ,</i>

<i>as soon as Amaya
gets to my place,</i>

<i>you disconnect,
and you and your mom</i>

<i>get the hell out of your house.
All right?</i>

<i>You're the only one
who might not be safe.</i>

<i>Uh, Damon's in London,
they can't get to him.</i>

<i>And Nari's got a friend
on the force,</i>

<i>so, so the cops
are already on their way.</i>

<i>Okay, listen,</i>

<i>you guys cannot stay there.</i>

<i>No, no, no.
We're not going to.</i>

<i>Wait, wait, wait, uh...</i>

<i>Um...</i>

<i>Hey, um, Amaya's...
Amaya's gonna be late.</i>

<i>She says there's something
wrong with the subway.</i>

<i>Do you, uh... do you guys...</i>

<i>Can you guys play
a little bit longer?</i>

<i>- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I, um, totally.</i>

<i>- Okay.
Hey, uh, Serena?</i>

<i>Serena, Nari.</i>

<i>- Serena?
Guys.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Uh, sorry, guys. Um, Nari's
skipping this round.</i>

<i>Uh... Matias,
can we play something else?</i>

<i>I'm getting, getting sick
of this game.</i>

<i>- How much longer?
How much longer for...</i>

<i>Where did the subway
break down?</i>

<i>Let me... let me just...
let me ask.</i>

<i>Uh, it's, uh,
Western Boulevard.</i>

<i>Western Boulevard.</i>

<i>Not far. Uh...</i>

<i>What's going on
with Nari?</i>

<i>Bathroom.
She's not feeling well.</i>

<i>Might be a while.</i>

<i>Oh, you know what, fuck around
all you want, asshole!</i>

<i>- AJ! Dude!
I got this shit all tied up!</i>

<i>- Do your worst!
It's gone, it's gone, AJ.</i>

<i>I am so sick and tired</i>

<i>of all you sheeple not being
sick and tired enough</i>

<i>to get off your...</i>

<i>...sick and tired...</i>

<i>sick and tired...
sick and tired...</i>

<i>That's the way
to avoid data corruption</i>

<i>when using parallel SSD.</i>

<i>...a corruption...
corruption.</i>

<i>The protest going on at the,
uh, Great American Mall</i>

<i>in downtown for Flint,
Michigan, for that dirty water.</i>

<i>That went on,
so, I'm gonna pack up</i>

<i>all my stuff,
go downtown to the mall,</i>

<i>and have some fun.</i>

<i>Go downtown to the mall
and have some fun.</i>

<i>The beautiful Second Amendment
that is keeping it legal</i>

<i>to have a storehouse
of assault weapons</i>

<i>and explosives...</i>

<i>assault weapons
and explosives...</i>

<i>weapons and explosives...</i>

<i>911, please state
the nature of your emergency.</i>

<i>I am sick and tired
of all... the corruption.</i>

<i>Sir,
is this a real emergency?</i>

<i>I'm gonna pack up all my...</i>

<i>assault weapons
and explosives.</i>

<i>Go downtown to the mall
and have some fun.</i>

<i>Sir, can you
tell me your name?</i>

<i>Jeffcock is a family name.</i>

<i>Wait...</i>

<i>They made that call
two minutes ago.</i>

<i>AJ, you need to get out of...</i>

<i>Police!
We have a search warrant!</i>

<i>No, I...</i>

<i>AJ, just get on the ground
right now, all right?</i>

<i>AJ, get on the...
get on the damn ground!</i>

<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get on the ground!</i>

<i>- Get on the ground now!
What's going on?</i>

<i>- Where is your son?
The basement.</i>

<i>Wait, wait, wait. What's this
on the screen right here?</i>

<i>- What's on the screen?
It's AJ's desktop.</i>

<i>- What is...
They're into his computer.</i>

<i>They're uploading something.</i>

<i>- Police, open the door!
I can't. I'm on the ground.</i>

<i>Open the door
or we'll break it down.</i>

<i>Okay. Okay, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

<i>- Stay down.
Oh, my God!</i>

<i>Open the door!</i>

<i>I'm coming! I'm coming!</i>

<i>- No! AJ!
No! No! No!</i>

<i>- AJ! No!
Stay on the ground.</i>

<i>- No. AJ!
Don't! AJ!</i>

<i>- No! No, no, no. Stay!
No!</i>

<i>AJ! No! AJ!</i>

<i>No! No! No!</i>

<i>Gun, gun!</i>

<i>Oh, my...</i>

<i>Suspect down.</i>

<i>Oh, AJ.</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>Fuck.</i>

<i>Matias, Damon...</i>

<i>Oh, my God!</i>

<i>Oh.</i>

<i>He's gonna kill Amaya</i>

<i>as soon as that train
reaches the station.</i>

<i>No, Nari is on her way there
right now.</i>

<i>- What?
Yeah, she's gonna try</i>

<i>and get there before
they can get to her.</i>

<i>I can...
I can get there faster.</i>

<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>

<i>What...</i>

<i>what's going on?</i>

<i>Bye, love you.</i>

<i>So, here's the only thing.</i>

<i>We were gonna tell them
tonight,</i>

<i>and over Skype.</i>

<i>Do you wanna...</i>

<i>Do you wanna not
tell them tonight or,</i>

<i>- or what...
No, it's perfect,</i>

<i>because this way,</i>

<i>Damon gets to be there
for the news.</i>

<i>AJ will be fine.
He's a big boy.</i>

<i>- Uh-hmm.
He's a big boy.</i>

<i>Big boy that'll
probably show up a lot</i>

<i>in symbolic protests.</i>

<i>That's probably true.</i>

<i>On a white horse.</i>

<i>- Like, he would love that.
Yeah.</i>

<i>Or with a boom-box.</i>

<i>Just John Cusack style.</i>

<i>And then we can put him
at your parents' table.</i>

<i>That'll be all the energy
we all need.</i>

<i>They're not coming, so....</i>

<i>You think they would magically
change their minds</i>

<i>and become modern?</i>

<i>I mean, I'm just...
their only daughter, so...</i>

<i>My mom.</i>

<i>No, your mom's gonna be okay.</i>

<i>- No. Nari.
She's... No, she has to be.</i>

<i>She's never gonna leave
that hospital.</i>

<i>Well, then, then,</i>

<i>let's, let's get married
tonight in her room,</i>

<i>and, and we can bring
the paperwork and...</i>

<i>In the ICU?</i>

<i>And she'll be our witness.</i>

<i>Yes, yes.</i>

<i>I love that idea.</i>

<i>But it's not the point.</i>

<i>I don't want you
to have to choose</i>

<i>between me and them.</i>

<i>That's...</i>

<i>It's not fair.</i>

<i>I don't want you
to have to choose.</i>

<i>I don't want you
to have to choose.</i>

<i>Wait, it's... That's Nari.</i>

<i>Wait.
Who, who, who is that?</i>

<i>That's my mom.</i>

<i>Oh, God!</i>

<i>No, no, no! No, no!</i>

<i>I will do anything.</i>

<i>Stop this right now!</i>

<i>I will do any...</i>

<i>Please!</i>

<i>Please, don't do this.</i>

<i>You can have me.
I don't care,</i>

<i>just, please, stop!</i>

<i>Please, please,</i>

<i>please, please!</i>

<i>Oh, God!</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>No, I can't.</i>

<i>I can't.</i>

<i>I can't.</i>

<i>No, no.</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>I won't.</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>Nari.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>Dammit!</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>Oh, God!</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>Nari!</i>

<i>Nari!</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, Serena,</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>Serena, Serena,
get out of there right now!</i>

<i>Serena,
oh, get out of there.</i>

<i>Serena, get out of there
right now!</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>Listen to me.</i>

<i>I want you to listen to me,</i>

<i>whoever I'm talking
to right now.</i>

<i>Amaya, my...</i>

<i>She has nothing to do
with any of this, okay?</i>

<i>She hasn't even...
she doesn't even know</i>

<i>I found the laptop,
all right?</i>

<i>The guy who lost it...
the guy who lost it,</i>

<i>he's, he's on the subway train
with her.</i>

<i>He's wearing a gray hoodie,</i>

<i>this is all his fault, okay?</i>

<i>She has nothing,
nothing to do with it!</i>

<i>Please!</i>

<i>I'll delete everything, okay?</i>

<i>You'll have nothing
to trace back to me, I swear.</i>

<i>If, if you kill him...</i>

<i>I don't care what you do to me,</i>

<i>I don't care what you do to me,</i>

<i>but just please leave Amaya
out of this!</i>

<i>No, no, no,
no, no, no.</i>

<i>Baby...</i>

<i>okay?</i>

<i>What?
Slow, slow, slow, slow.</i>

<i>Slow.</i>

<i>Um...</i>

<i>Go, go.</i>

<i>Go, go.</i>

<i>All right, uh,
you're going to get her, man?</i>

<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

<i>All right, just make sure
you leave the computer open</i>

<i>because I got to keep
downloading the video files.</i>

<i>- Uh, okay.
Now, Matias, just be careful,</i>

<i>- yeah?
Yeah.</i>

<i>You're there, aren't you?</i>

<i>Guess what?
I have been recording.</i>

<i>I've got the whole thing.</i>

<i>You should have dealt
with Matias.</i>

<i>He was gonna give
the computer back.</i>

<i>He was gonna give it back
and forget the whole thing,</i>

<i>but that is not
what I'm gonna do.</i>

<i>You see this?</i>

<i>Do you know what this is?</i>

<i>This is coordinates.</i>

<i>This is everywhere
that computer has been.</i>

<i>This is going to lead them
to Erica Dunne,</i>

<i>and every single girl you took.</i>

<i>You are finished!</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>- Damon, Damon, what's up?
Matias,</i>

<i>Matias, he didn't lose
the laptop.</i>

<i>Charon IV, he left it
there deliberately.</i>

<i>He wanted it to be found.
They all wanted it to be found.</i>

<i>See, it was a lure.
They were phishing.</i>

<i>Uh, from the moment you entered
your Wi-Fi password,</i>

<i>they were in, they've had
control this whole time.</i>

<i>Damon, I'm sorry,
but what are you...</i>

<i>It was a lie.</i>

<i>They're setting us up.</i>

<i>We did everything
they wanted us to do.</i>

<i>We moved the money.
We copied the videos.</i>

<i>They're gonna make it look like
it was us the whole time.</i>

<i>What? I... I'm sorry,</i>

<i>but how did you... hello?</i>

<i>Hello, hello?</i>

<i>Okay, I'll be right there.
I'm almost there.</i>

<i>I'm a second away.
I'm a second away.</i>

<i>Inside, where?
Inside where?</i>

<i>What building?
Amaya, what building?</i>

<i>What building are you in?</i>

<i>I told you to go to the park,</i>

<i>where we had
our first kiss, Amaya.</i>

<i>What pin... what pin
are you taking you about?</i>

<i>Amaya, I didn't...
I didn't send you anything.</i>

<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

<i>Amaya, Amaya, no!</i>

<i>Listen, listen.
Amaya, that's not me.</i>

<i>No, Amaya, that's not me!</i>

<i>Don't, don't, don't, don't.</i>

<i>Don't listen to any of it.</i>

<i>Amaya, please.</i>

<i>Amaya!</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Hello, hello.</i>

<i>Hello!</i>

<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

<i>Why?</i>

<i>It is game night.
It is game night.</i>

<i>It is game night.
It is game night.</i>

<i>It is game night.
It is game night.</i>

<i>It is game night.
It is game night.</i>

<i>Help me!</i>

<i>I'm Erica Dunne.</i>

<i>Can you hear me?</i>
