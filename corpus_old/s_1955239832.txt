What's one about?

It's a comedy ma'am.

It's a comedy?

Comedy, comedy

Is it funny?

I don't know ma'am.
I haven't seen it.

He hasn't seen it.

Hasn't seen it?

No, no.

I hope there's
no swearing in it.

I don't want swearing.

No, there's no swearing in it.

She hates swearing.

I'm not sure ma'am.

I can ask the manager.

He's gonna go ask the manager.

Ask the manager? No swearing.

No swearing.

For fuck's sake.

We need
to talk, Barbara.

Hey guys, could you turn
off your phone please?

Are you, Barbara?

Who is this Mr. Stick?

Hey guys, could please
turn off the phone?

Thank you.

Come in.

Come on guys, come on.

I'm trying to watch
a movie, all right?

Please just turn it off.

Hey shut off your
own phone jackoff.

We paid to watch the movie too.

Yeah, well you're
not watching it.

Hey, who are you old
man the local movie cop?

Kiss my ass.

Mr. Lee, I can check the
replacement unit in the morning.

Check
it now Johnson.

No morning, too late.

It's almost five o'clock.

You said it
Johnson, almost five o'clock.

So get working.

Yes, sir. Okay.

Dammit, son of a

I told that bitch to get
her own set of paper clips.

My god it's not like I'm
being paid to babysit her.

Yes, yes.

Exactly, exactly.

That cow needs to get a life.

No, no one respects
her up there.

Even corporate is
losing patience

Ma'am.

I'm trying to tell you

I can't stand that lady
Excuse me ma'am.

They get on my nerves.

Excuse me.

I promise you

I think I'm having

Not at all.

<b>STRESSED TO KILL</b>

<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

Well, you certainly
look a lot better

than you did the
last time I saw you.

How you feeling?

Lucky, apparently
you removed an elephant

that was sitting on my chest.

Interesting analogy,
I suppose I did.

Thanks for saving
my life, doc.

Well, you're
welcome, Mr. Johnson,

but you know you're
not out of danger yet.

I know, but you believe
me this was a wake up call.

Yes, it was, and you
can choose to blow it off

as a bump in the road
like a lot of guys do.

I promise ya it'd be a mistake.

What do you do for a living?

Inspecting and install
fire safety equipment.

Do you like your job?

Better than being stuck
in an office all day.

I hear that, but
is it stressful?

For the most part
no, outdoors on my own.

It's good work.

Well, do you have any hobbies?

What do you like to do?

I like to travel.

We used to do that a lot.

My wife has other interests now.

I see

It's 156 over 118.

Is that bad?

Well, let's just say
if it gets any higher,

you could be
visiting the morgue.

What do the numbers mean?

Well the top number
is the pressure

in your arteries
when your beats.

The bottom number
is the pressure

between beats when
your heart's at rest.

If you want to see another
set of birthday candles,

you're gonna have to get
these numbers way down.

120 over 80 ideally, a
little higher's acceptable.

Tell me if you had to pinpoint

the persistent stresses
in your life right now,

what would you say?

I guess people.

Yeah people.

A lot of assholes
out there, doc.

Sometimes I can't take it.

I understand, Bill.

Hell I agree with ya.

But you gotta learn
to get along them

as hard as that may
seem, and you need

to identify and get the
more persistent ones

out of your life completely.

How do you suggest I do that?

It's not easy to say.

Be creative.

I'm sure you'll come
up with something.

I want you to take
your blood pressure

every day and record it.

That'll tell ya if
it's working or not.

All right, okay, I'm on it.

Thanks doc.

Bill, you do not
need that much butter.

I'm not one of your
fatass clients, Vera.

Give me my toast!

No, but you don't
need that much fat.

You know you're headed for
another heart attack, Bill,

if you don't change your ways.

Thank you.

I cannot believe that you
drink those shakes dude.

They're terrible.

I had the strawberry.

Tasted like an old sock, Billy.

Wouldn't even feed
that to my dog.

Can't even clean
the floor with it.

I don't know how
the hell you do it.

What do

you mean you want
to see other people?

Are you breaking up with me?

My God, this has never
happened to me before.

Really?

Are you dumping me?

Yes, yes, he is dumping you.

Plastic bitch, hopefully
into a landfill.

Jesus,
Billy.

Brother, that was
straight cold, seriously.

It's been two weeks now right?

How you feeling man?

I think I'm ready
to go back to work.

Work?

Vera, she still busting
your balls, is that it?

It's her hobby.

You're supposed to be
home relaxing man, you know.

Chill out, smell the roses.

You got to take
care of that ticker

of yours, that's
what's important.

Somebody better
tell Vera that.

Hey!

What the hell!

You ever hear of 'excuse me'?

Hey!

Hell no.

Son of a bitch.

Hell, Billy
don't, stop Billy!

Billy! Don't do it man!

Hey!

Let it go, Billy!

Jesus Christ.

Jesus, Bill?

What happened to the show?

What show?

I only asked you
to do one thing,

my Celebrity Dance Off.

Why didn't you record it?

Why don't you just watch
the show when it's on?

Honey, I'm sorry, I hate,

I can't stand that thing.

You say that, Bill,
but when you got

nothing else to do all day long

but hang out with your
lazy-assed friend,

it's a little disappointing.

Disappointing?

I'm just saying.

Honey, I did not hang
out with Stan all day,

we just had lunch, all right.

I just had other things to do.

Like what?

Like getting the oil changed.

Getting stuff for work.

For work?

You're not going back to
work already, are you?

But what about
your yard project?

You mean, your yard project.

Bill, your doctor told
you to take it easy.

It's only been two weeks.

My blood pressure is down.

Yeah, that's hard to believe.

Billy, the doctor
told you he wants you

to avoid a stressful
environment.

That's why I'm going
back to work, sweetheart.

I'm just saying.

Crap!

Sweetie, no one's gonna

throw you out on the street.

And no one's gonna sell
all your things, okay?

Well, they got to send
you a letter first.

They better not.

I have nowhere else to go.

Well, what
else is wrong, honey?

I have
other bills, you know.

What about my Botox?

All I hear is words,
words don't mean crap,

Stanley, or pay
my bills, so talk.

Honey, I ain't got
nothing else I can give you.

I mean I don't and
if I did, I would.

And I told your lawyer that.

And he told me that
you're a filthy no-good liar.

He said chemist's
makes serious money.

Chemists with
three ex-wives don't, okay?

God, listen honey, I, I
need to go, all right?

Listen, I'll call you back later

and we'll work
something out, okay?

Don't
you hang up Stanley.

God! Jesus!

I love you, baby.

She's suing you
for the third time,

and you're giving her that shit?

It's my way of keeping her

psychologically medicated, Bill.

I mean, it's where I
need her to be right now.

Where you need her to be is

in a coffin six feet
under the ground.

That's a bit harsh.

So what's up?

I need a loan for a lawyer.

How much this time?

You already owe me a grand.

I do?

Well, tax time, that's
right around the corner.

We can work it out.

Okay, but after
this time that's it.

Yeah,
thanks buddy, yeah.

You know you'd be better off

using my three grand
to hire a hitman.

Now where might I
find one of those?

Hell, I don't know, internet?

Why don't you look for
three for one special?

Three ex-wives for
the price of one.

Interesting that you bring
up the subject of poisons.

They have a fascinating
history, you know.

What would you say is
the fastest acting poison?

How fast?

Kills you
instantly? Right away!

Well, I don't know too many
that have worked that fast,

but you know there are several

that bring almost
instant paralysis.

You know, you're dead like
thirty seconds later.

That's good enough for me.

Why are you so suddenly
interested in poisons?

I'm just a curious cat.

Curiosity killed
the cat, my friend.

Cat should have been
more damned careful.

Okay, I got a raccoon
tearing up the yard.

I got to do something.

Little bastards!

Excuse, girl, Veronica
can kiss my hairy rearend.

She is not the boss of me.

It's hard to believe she's
still got a damn job.

She got to be blowing
somebody in Contracts.

Sweet Jesus!

You were coming
to bed an hour ago.

What are you doing in
here on a Friday night?

You know I still
remember a time

when people knocked,
even on Fridays.

Sorry, did I interrupt
you jerking off or something?

No, I did that earlier.

Now I'm planning our future.

I can only imagine.

Well, you're going to
need more than a plan

if you ever plan to
be someone, Bill.

I am someone, sweetheart.

I'm Bill Johnson.

I'm perfectly happy
with that, okay?

Life isn't just a
dress rehearsal, Bill.

You really need to step it up.

I got a few
surprises up my sleeve.

I believe that this is

what you were inquiring about.

A little Hollywood,
don't you think?

Hell no, I don't want
you to be mistaking it

for, you know, cough syrup.

How much punch does it have?

Let's put it this way.
They ain't getting up.

Who's they?

I don't know.

I should be asking
you that, mystery man.

Raccoons? Yeah.

Hey, that work
colleague you mentioned

is he fat and bald?

Are you talking about
Flip, Flip Feinstein?

Hell yeah, he's uglier than
both of us combined, Billy.

His name is Flip?

Yeah, but everyone seems
to call him, Big Boy.

He seems to fancy himself
quite the lady's man.

You're kidding me?

Yes, I'm kidding.

Well, you seen the guy, right?

Hell, I'm thinking
the last woman

that actually touched his
wiener was his mother.

Yeah, she was changing
his diaper. Yeah.

Yep, I should be home
around seven o'clock.

What the hell?

No problem.

Come on buddy, get your stinking
tank out of my driveway.

Mother fucking
bastard, ridiculous.

Hey zip cat, were your
ears painted on or what?

Are you having
a bad day, buddy?

You're in my driveway.

I got to go to work.

Okay, I gotta go.

So that's how it is?

Jesus, this guy's on the tank.

Son of a bitch, this
guy's gonna kill somebody.

Son of a bitch.

What's your problem, faggot?

You want a date or something?

Hold on man.

You are my problem, asshole.

You don't quit driving like
that you're gonna kill somebody.

I can't hear you
man. I can't hear you.

Shit.

Are you crazy?

Nice job, Mr. Johnson,
I'm very impressed.

Whatever it is you're
doing seems to be working.

Care to share your secret?

Not yet, it's still
in the testing stage.

I see, well other than that,
how's everything else been?

You staying out of trouble?

For the most part yeah,
I did go back to work.

I don't know, it
may be a bit soon.

You still need to take it easy.

I can't relax at home, doc.

Does your wife work?

From home.

I see, all right, but
just don't overdo it, okay?

Yes, sir.

Now listen to me.

You're not recovering
from a cold.

The heart means business.

Thanks, doc, I understand.

Brent! Brent!

Sir, over here.

Don't tell me we got
transferred now back to traffic?

No sir, no, no, this
isn't a traffic case.

In fact, I think this
man was murdered.

You want to enlighten me?

Come take a look.

What am I looking at?

Here.

You see that dart?

Yeah, I got eyes, I can see.

That didn't kill him.

No, sir, but I believe
that this one did.

It was removed from
the victim's neck.

I'm guessing poison.

Dear God, not again.

No refuge from these
inconsiderate bastards.

Lionel, you know

no, nothing personal to it,

I despise all men,

actually I despise...

all women too.

Come to think of it,

I despise everyone.

Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

Could you keep it down please,
it's kind of a small theater.

Could you turn off
your phone, too?

Thank you.

Screw him, the guy
thinks he owns the place.

I know.

Jesus.

Hold the
phone up a little higher

so they can see it on the TV.

Let's go
this Indian place.

I hate Indian food.

No, it's
good for your skin.

Excuse me, I just asked you

politely to please keep it down.

Who the hell are you?

Shut your pie hole!
My turn to talk.

I paid fourteen
bucks for a movie,

I don't pay to listen
to your mundane bullshit

or to watch you wave your
stupid phones around.

Don't you shush me!

I'm doing this for you, too.

Hell, I'm doing
this for all of you.

Not one of you sons-a-bitches
have the balls to complain.

Turn the phone off and keep

your mouth shut until
the movie is over.

Thank you.

Fuck you.

Please!
Give it to me.

Yeah, baby!

Come on!

Baby.

Fuck,
Flip, give it to me.

Come on,
turn around baby.

Yeah, hell yes,
baby, hell yes.

Ashley? Hey.

What are you doing
here? What a surprise!

Come here.

What are you trying to do?

Give your old man
another heart attack?

I'm sorry, Daddy.

I did call the house,
but there was no answer.

That's all right, I'll
forgive you this time.

It's good to see
you. You look great.

You're looking good yourself.

Much better than how
Mom described you.

What were you expecting?

I, I don't know, I thought
you'd be in bed at least.

Really?

My God,
look who's here.

Hey

When did you drop in?

An hour ago?

You staying for dinner?

I'd love to, but
we're heading back

to Atlanta for dinner
date at Dave's parents.

How are his parents doing?

They're fine, still on
that exercise kick, Mom?

It's not a kick, Ashley,
it's a way of life.

That's just great.

Dad's looking pretty good?

Well, I don't know
what you call good,

I mean, he's still
not out of the woods.

What woods would
those be dear?

This is V.

Daddy, Mom never stops
just pounding away, does she?

Yeah, yeah, your Mom's
a regular jackhammer.

What's going on, Sweetie?

I don't know to tell you this,

but I really am surprised
to see you looking so good.

I mean, it's great,
don't get me wrong,

It's just that when
Mom said there was

all kind of complications,
after the heart attack,

and that's why you
guys needed the money,

I, I expected you to look
like crap and you don't.

What money?

For the operation?

After your insurance
got cancelled?

What operation?

Your bypass?

The bypass,
yeah, how much money

was that again, Sweetie?

$150,000.

Your mother asked
David for a $150,000?

Well, she asked David if
he would ask his parents.

They were cool. They
were happy to help.

When was this?

Couple days ago.

Mom's going to be mad as hell
at me for telling you this.

She made me promise
not to say anything.

Not a word.

Scout's honor?

Scout's honor.

Daddy, next operation,
it, it's serious, right?

It's serious.

Well, don't die
me, Daddy, okay?

I'd hate to be left
alone with Mom.

I'm not going anywhere,
not for a while.

You better not.

You know how much I love you.

I love you more.

That's debatable.

And
embedded in the necks

of both victims were
needlelike darts.

The police suspect the
needles contained a poison,

which killed the victims
soon after impact.

Here they come.

Okay, back
up, give us some space,

give us some space, please.

Detective?

Give us a minute, please.
Put that camera down.

Detective!

Give us a second, please.

Detective, please,
early reports suggested

there was a witness
in the theatre.

We have
several witnesses, yeah.

According to the wife
of the victim, here,

the husband, he had some
sort of scuffle here

with some man prior
to the incident.

I don't think that
individual is involved.

If he could indulge me and
come down to the department,

have a coffee with
me, I can clear him.

And I'll just be the
old fly on the wall.

Enough of the questions,
enough of the questions,

put the cameras
down, please, man.

Give that girl

on her knees and pray to
God she wears those shoes.

Mr. Gates, the last
victim of the individual

some have called "The Dart Man"

died while watching the
critically acclaimed

Oscar nominated, "Six
Bullets for Barbara."

Holy Shit,

He
Was 73 years old

and leaves behind a wife

He did it.

And three dogs.

That son of a bitch did it!

What?

Johnson, that you?

Who else would it be?

Yes, Mr. Lee, yes, it's me.

Welcome back
to the rat race, Johnson.

I'm sorry, but
plans changed this morning.

I need you back at Bells,
pop off right here.

No, Mr. Lee, I'm five
minutes from the barracks,

it'll take me ninety
minutes to get back to Bell.

It can wait
till the afternoon.

Bell building more
important, more money.

Mr. Lee, I'm not
working this afternoon.

What?

Why you not tell me that?

You know I'm on half days
for the next two weeks.

I had a heart attack, remember?

Half day no good
today, I already short staffed.

I need you help me out.

Okay, what the hell,
all right, I'll do it.

I said I'll do it, I'll
do it this afternoon.

Why are you
still on phone, Johnson?

Get cracking!

Yeah, so that's what I
was trying to tell you.

What?

Well, if they expect me to
do that, they can pay me.

Do I look like a charity?

No, you look like an
island with an elephant legs.

What, what kind of
validation I need Jemma?

I know, I'm beautiful.

Well, he's a wimp, I
wouldn't date his ass either.

Have you seen the
kind of car he drives?

A ugly truck with
a tray in the back.

Get real, McNeil!

Well, I done heard every
excuse in the lexicon, darling.

My ex-wife's gouging
me, I'm still trying

to pay my college loans,
I prefer to eat at home.

The cracker

My parents lost their
savings on Wall Street,

and I'm still trying to
help them out, yeah, right.

Kick him to the curb baby.

He is not going to put
a ring on your finger.

Well, at least not
the one you deserve.

He don't deserve you, you need
to get with someone who does.

You should try a dating site.

Yeah, a Jewish dating site.

Who gives a shit that
you're not Jewish,

by the time he finds
out, it'll be too late.

Dear.

Gosh, excuse
me, it's my floor.

Is she all right?

Hello!

Is that you William?

No, this is Santa Claus.

William's out back
feeding an elf.

Well Santa in case you happen

to be driving that
sleigh of yours,

I suggest you stop by my
place on your way home?

There's something that
Billy and I need to discuss.

Why? What the
hell's so important?

Don't you watch the news?

Okay.

All right, I'm here,
what's going on?

Jesus, get in here.

You're all over the news.

That douchebag at the movies,

some guy in a car, Jesus, Billy.

What are you doing man?

You're running around
killing people.

Some detective thinks
that the same person

might responsible for
both murders.

Brilliant?

My doctor said to
eliminate stress from life.

Yeah, and you
took his advice.

Clearly, it's working.

I had a rough couple of days.

Yeah?

Tell me about it.

All right, so Vera's
exercise program

now includes
screwing her clients.

And the client she's
screwing is your buddy.

Big Boy?

And screwing in the park

is the exercise
program she has him on.

You, you actually saw 'em?

Yeah, I saw him, and let
me tell you something buddy,

she wasn't changing
his diaper either.

Jesus, Billy,
hell no, hell no.

And on top of that
I just found out

that Vera conned David's family

out of a whole bunch of money.

And she's probably
going to use it

to hire a lawyer to take
me for everything I have.

Maybe run off with Big
Boy, who the hell knows.

Is that all?

No, no, actually it's not.

I also killed a fat hog
in an elevator today,

and it didn't do shit
for my blood pressure.

So after three murders, my
solution is no longer working.

What's going on with you?

You gotta be better than me?

And you're gonna, you're
gonna want to shoot me

with one of them
damned darts of yours,

when you hear what
I got to tell you.

Sweet Jesus, all
right, okay, hit me.

God, I gave
Thelma the three grand.

You are a lunatic.

And, of course, she lost
it all, gambled it all.

I mean, she is pissier
than ever, Billy.

She is definitely suing me.

Congratulations Stanley,
you are officially

a bigger fucking idiot
than I thought you were.

The money was for your lawyer.

I know, I know,
and I wholly intended

to give it to him, I did.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, but after
you banged her all night,

your brain turned to mush
and you thought 41 years

of insanity would be
cured with three grand?

Well, she was
starting to sound

real reasonable,
Billy, I mean, really.

Yeah, yeah,
yeah, about the time

she was having a
screaming orgasm?

Yeah, yeah, you know, it
was right about that time.

I'm sorry, Billy, I didn't...

Shut up, shut up or
I'll murder you, too.

All right, I got to kill her.

That's what has to happen.

You owe me.

You owe me Thelma's murder.

No, you can't be serious?

Yes, I'm serious.

If this friendship's gonna
survive, she has to go.

She started murdering
you the day she met you.

No, it can't be a dart
or the same poison for her.

That'll lead the
cops straight to you.

You're not thinking about
shooting her, are you?

That's what the
bitch deserves.

No, that'll be dumb.

Besides, I want to be
close when I do it.

I want to see the
life force leave.

All right, all right.

Maybe cyanide in
spray form, yeah.

Two, maybe three
blasts in her mouth,

almost instant paralysis,

it'll look like a heart attack.

Is it detectable?

Nope.

You positive?

Yeah.

We gotta find a
way to get to her.

Doesn't she still
live with her mother?

Hell, she even work?

Why would she want to do that?

She's got me working for her.

The only time she ever leaves

the house is to
go see her lawyer.

And I'm paying for that, too.

Not for long.

Hey, she still in that
twelve step program?

What are you doing today?

Taking care of a problem.

You forgot your phone.

No, I didn't.

Wait, wait, wait.

Damn.

No, no, no, that stays here.

What?

The cell phone, it's
a tracking device.

Gets pinged by cell towers.

That's how cops place
you at a crime scene.

Seriously?

Seriously, It's
called triangulation.

Anybody that brings a
cell phone with them to do

a crime is just
asking to get caught.

What do I do now?

Leave it here and turn it on.

That way if you're
ever suspected,

it looks like you
were home all day.

That's neat.

All right, let's
rock and roll.

Yeah, shit.

Jesus, there she is, Bill.

She's right on time.

At least she has one
positive attribute.

Okay, remember all right,
two blasts and then she's down.

You sure about that?

You wanna test it?

No, no, just fine,
take your word for it.

You know if she doesn't go to
the bathroom, we're screwed.

She'll use it, her
bladder is like a sieve.

Good luck.

Thanks.

Last time I went
to an AA meeting,

I wasn't planning on
killing anybody but myself.

Yeah, yeah.

Help, my goodness.

I'm sorry, someone
help me, please.

My God!

Miss, could you help me?

I have taken a tumble,
I'm so sorry, dear.

I'm so embarrassed.

Are you all right?

I'm so sorry, I can't just

Thank you.

Do you need medication?

Thank you, my...

Bill?

I never liked you,
Thelma, you're mean.

She didn't suffer, did she?

It was just like you said.

Couple of blasts
and she was gone.

Thank you.

That's what friends are for.

Who invited Big Boy?

He invited himself.

He's the one who
introduced me to Thelma.

Why does that not surprise me?

How ya feeling?

Like Houdini after a
spectacular escape.

Sautéed onions and
peppers, that sounds good.

Good afternoon, Mr. Kelly.

You don't mind if
I sit down, do you?

Well actually I wanted
to spend some time alone.

Thank you, I appreciate it.

Sure

Detective Jordan, I don't want

to be here, to
tell you the truth.

It's your day of grieving.

I just got a few questions,
the old routine stuff.

What kind of questions?

This concerns the
death of your ex-wife.

By the way that was a
very lovely funeral.

Well thank you very much.

I didn't know you were there,
did someone invite you?

No, no, I invited myself.

Part of the job, sometimes
we attend the funeral

of a murder victim
just to take a look.

See who shows up, it's
not uncommon sometimes

even for the killer to attend.

Did you, did you say
murder victim, Detective?

My Thelma, she, well she
died of a heart attack.

Yeah, we thought that
at first, but the coroner

he found traces of
cyanide in her lungs.

Now how crazy is that?

Your ex-wife being
murdered like that.

Murdered? Cyanide?

Are you absolutely certain
of that, Detective?

Yeah, I'm quite sure.

You okay?

Who on earth would
want to kill my Thelma?

Mr. Kelly, I'm sitting
here kind of hoping

you'd help me figure that out?

All right, look,
I'm not a cop, man.

I'm not going to
hurt you, all right.

Look, I'm gonna lift
the lid a little.

Be cool.

What do you want?

Nothing man, nothing.

Hey, you're the guy that shot

the convenience store
clerk back there?

You saw that?

Yeah man, it was awesome.

Somebody called the cops,
they're on their way.

Goddammit, what can I do?

Think they'll find me in here?

Probably man, I mean they
always look in dumpsters.

Your plan was kind of weak.

Plan, what plan?

Why'd I shoot that guy?

He already gave me the money.

I just need a fix,
can you help me?

Yeah man, I can help
you, I can ease your pain.

Okay, please help
me out of this shit.

Hey who, what's
that on your neck?

I got like a bug or something?

Nighty night.

Crap.

Hello?

Buddy, hey, it's Stan.

He's kind of dopey
Billy, you know.

I mean, he talked real slow.

Here, here.

If he's so dopey, why
did he come see you?

I don't know, it was
pretty informal, really.

Routine he said, yeah.

Hell, he even
picked up the check.

You had an informal
meeting with the detective?

It was just some
questions about Thelma.

You know, when's the
last time I saw her?

That was one, did anybody
have any problems with her?

Yeah, that was another one.

Here
at the convenience

store
But you know

he did mention the
cyanide though.

He mentioned
the cyanide, Stan?

You told me cyanide was
undetectable, you said that.

Well that's
what I thought.

That's what you thought?

Yeah

You didn't
know it for sure?

Sir, there
was some speculation earlier

that the killer of the
convenience store shooter

from earlier this
afternoon may have been

the work from "The Dart Man"?

It's a routine investigation,
that's what he said.

Buddy, there ain't
nothing routine

about Thelma's death now
that they've found cyanide.

How many people do you think

die naturally of
cyanide poisoning?

If you would stop glamorizing
him into being some kind

of super hero, because he's not.

People, we have, we
have a pathetic loser

here on the loose
who is randomingly

killing people for the
sheer pleasure of it.

For a dopey guy, he's
doing a pretty smart job.

Soon he'll be wanting
to have coffee with me.

Well he kind of sort of
did ask me who you were.

But I know he seemed more
interested in Flip, Billy.

In Flip?

Yeah, yeah, well I,
I guess he thinks he's,

he looks more like a
criminal than I do.

Yeah. He wants
to have coffee with him.

Coffee, what coffee, what?

What is it with
this guy and coffee?

You have sacrificed here

a moral imperative for
sheer sensationalism,

and that is unacceptable,
unacceptable.

Paul Jordan, good
night and good luck.

You ask me if I'm close?

I'm close to having a
nervous breakdown, thank you.

I don't think there's
any reason to panic.

I think we're going to be okay.

No, we are not going
to be okay, Stan.

I don't like the
sound of any of this.

The fact that he's
already talked to you

let's me know that he's onto us.

Don't you think you're over
reacting just a little bit?

No, no, I do not
think I'm over reacting.

I think I'm under reacting.

All the shit I got
going on at home

and now you bring
this to my door, too.

Your damned ex-wife.

Don't matter whether
she's dead or alive,

she's still fucking us both.

You do not agree to any
more coffee meetings

with this detective, right?

I don't care if he pays or not.

You're under no
obligation to talk to him.

Okay, I won't, but what
the hell are we going to do?

I'll figure something out.

Come in.

You have a moment?

Yeah, sure.

We really need to talk.

Okay, let's talk.

Here?

Yeah, what's wrong with here?

Why not?

Bill, it hasn't been so good
with us for quite a while.

That's a shocker,
get to the point.

All right, I want
you to move out.

It can't go on like this.

You want me to
move out of my house?

You want me to move out of my
parents' house, are you crazy?

I'm divorcing you,
Bill, you're gonna have

to move out sooner or later.

Is that right?
Who's the lucky guy?

What are you talking about?

There's no one else.

I'll move out of this
house when I'm dead.

Close the door.

I'm sorry.

Get your ridiculous
clown face out of here.

Hey it's Bill, isn't it?

Do I know you?

Not if you don't watch TV

No sir, I don't.

That's okay, we can't
arrest you for that, right?

I'm Paul Jordan, a detective.

This is Detective Brent.

Yeah, that's some cool
rig you got here Billy.

What, are you in the
extermination business, man?

No sir, I'm in fire safety.

Yeah, what? Now
that's 30 years on the job?

Shit, the older
I get, the worst I see.

I thought I saw the worst.

Hey gentlemen,
if you don't mind,

I got places to be,
I'm a schedule today.

Hey, don't let us hold
you, go split, that's cool.

But you know, you're not,
you're not curious, man.

How I know your name?

No sir.

No?

How about you, Brent? Curious?

Yeah, I find it
extremely curious.

Well, I assumed
you ran my plates.

No, I didn't need to.

Your buddy Stan, he
gave me your name.

He's cool, I like Stan.

We had a long chat,
yeah, very cool.

Yeah, Stan's a great guy.

Yeah, but he didn't
mention me to you?

No sir.

Bam! I'm disappointed.

That's wild, yeah.

So, what is it with
you and Stanley then?

You're not, you're not
particularly close?

We've been friends
for years, we're close.

But you don't talk?

Yeah, we talk, yeah.

Well, I mean, there's
things you don't talk about?

I'm not his wife, Detective.

Well, that's
probably a good thing.

He's already had three.

Hey gentlemen, do you mind,

could we get to
the point, please?

Shit, there's no
point, there's no point.

We're going to go.

No, I'm not gonna rain on
the parade, so to speak, man.

But I'll tell you something
I could not do your job, man.

Being on the road all
day, all day with assholes

Breathing their shit,
I'd snap, I'd snap.

Fuck it, I'd take a few of
them out, yes siree bob!

It's frustrating
some days, yeah.

I like to drive.

Yeah?

People aren't so bad.

Man, that is beautiful.

Somebody's been a bad boy.

You drinkin' and drivin' Billy?

You been a bad boy?

You got a problem
with the sauce?

Not any more.

You gentlemen have a good day.

You too, Bill.

Think about it, man,
we'll see you soon.

Bill, someone's at the
door, can you see who it is?

Shut up, Vera.

Billy boy.

Is everything all right here?

What?

I've been knocking here
for five minutes, you know.

You certainly take
your goddamned time.

Is there something here going
on that I don't know about?

You all right?

Detective, do you
know what time it is?

Yeah, it's five
after midnight.

You make a habit
of visiting suspects

at five after midnight?

Suspect? What are
you talking about?

You consider yourself a suspect.

Suspect, for what?

You done something I
need to know about?

No! You been a bad boy?

No! I'm here.

When a guy gets a
visit from the police

after midnight, he tends
to assume the worst.

Yeah, well, you know,
that ain't a bad point,

but you know, not
when the visit is

in an unofficial capacity,
don't give me that shit.

Unofficial capacity?

Yeah.

Detective, what do you want?

You said you liked to drive.

I drove over here.

I brought my truck,
I got my rig.

You showed me your rig,
I want to show you mine.

That's all, we'll
go for a drive.

You want me to
look at your truck?

Yeah, I drove it
all the way over here.

Five after midnight you
want me to look at your truck?

Billy, you see that rocker?

I'm only rockin',
when you're ready.

So what do you think?

These are the streets, Bill.

What streets?

The streets I drove
twenty years, man.

Most of my soul grew right here.

Yeah, most of my soul.

You don't mind if I
call you Bill, do you?

No, everybody else does.

Yeah. That's
funny stuff, man.

That's
funny shit, you know.

I got to do more of that
funny stuff back, you know.

Everybody else does.

Shit.

You see that place?

That's bad people, Bill,
I mean bad.

We'll burn that to the
ground, you and me.

With every one in
it, nobody cares.

And I mean nobody.

You see what I'm saying?

I'm still loving the
skunks here, man.

It's the funny stuff, you know,

the funny stuff,
it just slips away.

It all comes from a place,
you know, the rage and shit.

Rage, you know rage, right?

Sure is a scary area.

I don't know, I think
it's not scarier than this.

So what's going on, Detective?

Why the hell did
you bring me here?

You know, I got
to get home, I got

to work in the morning.

I know, you got
to exterminate.

You got to exterminate problems.

I'm in fire safety.

I'm talking about
those bugs, Billy.

Those bugs, who is going
to exterminate them?

Cause somebody's got to do
something before it's too late.

They got to be
exterminated, you know.

Like crops
just like that.

That's how you exterminate
them, not with poisons.

Now you got to watch, you
know, you cut and run.

You got to watch, man.

You got to watch,
that life just leaves.

That's a high, it
really is a high.

This is a high like there's
nothing else on Earth.

You up for it, Billy?

Think you mad like me?

You ready to
exterminate?

Maybe you want to go
after the big bugs?

The black colored
mother fuckers!

Yeah, the mood calls, crush
them into the goddamned floor.

You don't need them, we're a
team, we'll make a difference.

Be like Gods! Be like Gods!

What do you say?

I'm not so sure
about that, Detective.

Paul!

I call you Bill,
you call me Paul.

Okay, Paul.

Good.

You see that shit?

That's what I'm talking about.

You gonna let that shit slide?

You gonna let it slide, are we?

No fuckin' way, why Billy, why?

I tell you why, cause they
don't own the goddamned street.

We do! You get it?

Look, I got to
get home, all right?

I ain't gonna take this shit.

What do I got to do?

I'm gonna show you a real man

exterminates real
vermin and real quick.

You watch! You watch!

Come here mother fucker!

What the fuck?

The fuck?

And that's how
you do it, Bill.

That's how the
professionals do it.

You know, not with
this chicken shit.

Using a blow dart, a blow dart,
I got a blow dart.

I'm gonna blow you to death.

Get the fuck outta here, man.

That's for pussies.

Shit, come on man, you're turn.

My turn for what?

Crush some bugs.

Come on, pick one
out, kick some ass.

Pick one out and kick some ass.

I don't think so.

Yes, crush a bug!

I don't think so.

Get out of my truck.

What?

I said get out of my truck.

What the hell?

Fuck, piece of shit.

Jesus, what are ya doing?

Get the fuck out

-of my truck.
-What!

What the hell are you doing?

You having a crisis, Billy?

You having a crisis?

You have a little
crisis of a conscience?

My conscience is fine.

I'm not into hurting people.

Don't give me that shit.

We're not talking about
people, those are the insects.

You got to crush a bug, Billy.

Yeah, you gonna crush a bug.

I'm not doing it.

Yeah, you're
gonna crush a bug.

-Come on, come on.
-I'm not

doing it!

Yeah, you're gonna do
it, cause you know why?

Cause you promised.

I didn't promise.

Yeah, you promised, yeah,
yeah, you promised.

You said it, you said it.

I didn't promise you.

We're partners,
we're partners.

We're not partners, Detective.

Paul! Paul!

I'm going home.

What did you say to me?

I'm going home,
I can't do this.

I'm going home.

You going home, Billy boy?

Are you good with
a blow dart, Billy?

Please! Please!

Are you good with a blow dart?

Please!

That's interesting.

No.

That's really real,
real interesting.

Hey, you're good.

Yeah, you're good and ready.

Billy boy.

Boy!

Jesus, Billy, boy,
you look like hell.

No, I look
like hell.

Good God, it's 3
AM, what's going on?

I just spent the evening

with your coffee
loving detective.

And for a stupid guy, he
pretty much knows everything.

He's about this close to
sending us both to jail.

He's got nothing on us, Billy.

He's nuts! He's scary nuts.

And he ain't gonna stop
until he's buried us both.

He's harmless, Bill.

He just took me down
town, in an ice cream truck,

and tried to goad me
into hurting somebody,

to, to confirm his suspicions

that I'm the killer
he's looking for.

He even beat up his own
partner to make his point.

He's nuts.

Yeah that,
that is a problem.

So what, what are you gonna do?

No!

What, what are we gonna do?

That's it, what are we gonna do?

I'm coming, I'm coming,
you impatient bastard.

Stan the man,
put it there bro.

Big Boy, thanks for coming.

Yeah, get in here,
so how's it going?

If I told you the
truth, you'd be green

with envy and want
to kill yourself.

Yeah, yeah, I know,
it sucks to be me.

Yeah, yeah.

So well hell you're lookin'
mighty fit there Big Boy.

I got to tell ya.

All that exercise shit must
be really working out for you?

Yeah, it's working out.

Ain't exactly shittin' pounds,
but I'm having a ball trying.

Yeah, yeah.
You know I, I hear that.

Yeah Vee, she's, well she's
a real fun lady, ain't she?

She is, indeed, lots of fun.

Lot of fun?

I'm awful sorry about Thelma,
you must miss her a lot.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Things are definitely different.

Now that she's
gone and all, yeah.

Sure bro, that gal was
a habit hard to break.

Yeah, yeah, say you know I've
always been a little curious

Were you two you
know ever a thing?

You know, you know, yeah.

You mean way back when?

Yeah, yeah, you know, back
when you hand balled her to me.

Yeah.

Sure we were.

Tell you the truth
about that one, buddy.

Thelma would never let me plow
the Hershey highway, right.

I was pretty cool with
it for a while anyway.

She had every right
to deny the Big Boy

access to the promised land.

And I had the right to
seek access elsewhere.

So when I found it it
was just about time

to say bye-bye baby to Thel.

That's when you happened along.

Now that what
you're saying is

I broke her in
actually?

Well, not exactly.

On the morning of the
night you first showed up,

she finally gave me all
access pass

Course I was already a month
into my new relationship

by then, so didn't
mean shit, so to speak.

Well that
definitely does suck

to be me then, doesn't it?

I guess so.

Hey, after I take a piddle,
you want to get high?

A little

Yeah, yeah, sure, why not?

Certainly couldn't hurt.

The switch, the light
switch it's on the wall there.

Yep, got it.

All right, yep.

Come on, there you go
promise land.

Hey Vee!

Stan, what are you doing here?

Billy's not an
idiot, you know?

He knows all about you and Flip.

What do you mean?

What the hell are
you talking about?

And the money,
yeah, the money.

Ouch, what is this?

You were never good
enough for Billy, Vee.

He deserves so much
better than you.

Please.

Don't bother, you're done.

Bill?

What are you, what
are you doing here?

What's up?

Jesus, I've been looking
everywhere for that bad boy.

Where did you find it?

You left it in Stan's.

Stan, Stan.

You wanna, you wanna come in?

I just made some coffee.

Sure, what could it hurt?

You take cream?

I like to live dangerously.

Me too.

It should be my motto,
careful, it's hot.

Vee says hey

Cool, tell her I say hey.

How's it going with Vee?

Losing weight,
reaching your goals?

You know, to be
honest man, it's tough.

I'm still eating like a slob,
so that doesn't help things.

What about the sex?

Sorry?

The sex.

What are ya talking about?

The sex, Flip, you know.

Where you take your penis,
insert it into my wife's vagina,

thrust it vigorously
back and forth.

That's the sex.

My question is, are you
losing any weight doing that?

Jesus, it was her idea man.

I didn't want to do it.

I was never comfortable.

I told her it wouldn't end well.

Just answer the
question, Flip.

Are you losing weight
fucking my wife?

No, no, no, I'm not
losing any weight.

Then what's the point?

She's a lousy lay.

Bill, I didn't
know what to say, buddy.

It's over, I'll stop.

I'll never touch her again
or contact her.

You don't understand.

I don't want you to stop.

You're welcome to her.

I was done with
that shit years ago.

I just didn't have the
balls to cut it off.

You will not stop
fucking my wife!

You got that?

What?

I'm giving her to you.

She's yours, I'm
transferring ownership.

God, this is crazy.

Think of it as an
early Christmas present.

I don't understand.

I don't expect
you to understand.

I forgot, I got
something for ya.

Okay

You mean, in your pocket?

You want me to reach
in your, in your...

guys, big deal,
straight, we like girls.

Big deal, let me
get this, I got it.

Okay, okay, reach into your
pocket, it's no big deal.

What's this?

This will exponentially
enhance your pleasure.

Having sex not only with my wife

but with other
men's wives as well.

What the hell are...

Shut up, you'll thank me later.

Okay, okay, whatever you say.

You like to get
high, don't you?

Sure, sure
I'm the Big Boy.

I always get high baby.

It's gonna blow your mind.

All right.

Blow your mind, but
the ladies love it too.

Okay.

Yeah

See you just open your mouth,

yeah put in there, give
yourself two squirts.

Yeah?

It's like a time machine
back to the sixties,

so just relax, ride the wave.

Sweet dreams Big Boy.

Surely goodness

and mercy

He shall receive
blessings from the Lord,

righteousness of God
and his salvation.

He restoreth my soul.

He leadeth me in the paths

of righteousness
for his name's sake

Yea, though I walk
through the valley

of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil,

for thou art with me, thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me.

Thou preparest a table before me

in the presence of mine enemies.

Thou anointest my head with
oil, my cup runneth over.

Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow me

all the days of my
life, and I shall dwell

in the house of
the Lord for ever.

Lord of Host, he is
the King of Glory.

To thee Lord, do
I lift up my soul,

my God trust in thee,
let me not be ashamed.

Do not let my enemies
triumph over me.

Thank you for coming, Mr. Lee.

No problem, Johnson.

No rest for wicked, Johnson.

See you back at
work in two hour.

What?

Is there a problem, Johnson?

Actually yes,
yes there is, yes.

Johnson, you're too serious.

Relax, I make joke, you take
week off, full pay.

What the hell was that about?

Apparently my boss is a
comedian but only at funerals.

Thank you, man.

I owed you one, buddy.

I owe you a lot more.

Take care pal.

Are you okay?

All right, I almost
forgot to give you this.

Daddy, what's this for?

I don't think I'm
going to need it anymore.

I'm feeling a lot better.

It's just you and me now.

Yeah, I can live
with that, come on.

The Dart
Man, whose real name

is Flip Feinstein,
took his own life

after killing Vera Johnson,
his personal trainer.

Cell phone records
and a business card

placed Mr. Feinstein at the
scene of the final murder.

Poison, a box of darts
and a blowpipe were

also recovered from
the Dart Man's...

Guess is wasn't that
Johnson guy after all?

You were wrong this time, boss.

It appears that way,
especially with the blinds.

I was real sorry to hear
about your wife, Bill.

Thank you, doc, it was rough
but we're getting though it.

You know, all things considered,
you look damned good.

I feel good.

Looks like you
were able to remove

those persistent
stresses in your life.

How did you do it?

Took your advice.

And you were right, get
rid of the big problems.

The small ones
don't mean nothing.

Well, ain't that the truth.

So what are your plans now?

I'm just going to take
it one day at a time.

You're a wise man, Bill.

And whatever it is what
you've been doing, don't stop.
