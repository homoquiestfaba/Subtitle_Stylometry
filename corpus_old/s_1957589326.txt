(distant siren wails)

â™ª You didn't have to buy me bread â™ª

â™ª I'll eat yesterday's instead â™ª

â™ª I think my clothes will be just fine â™ª

â™ª I like to wear them more than twice â™ª

â™ª And you can rest your eyes â™ª

â™ª They needn't work for
me, please compromise â™ª

â™ª And sparkle â™ª

â™ª Sparkling Touria â™ª

(lively chatter)

Really?

It's like 10.

Wine, it's called Malbec.

It's from Argentina and it's
really expensive, for you.

I'm happy for you two.

You could try to sound sincere.

I was, it's really expensive.

Thanks, bro.
I promised one hour.

Could you try just a little?

I mean, I'm here, is Mom here?

Look, she's making the effort.

Can I please have one person on my side,

without having to beg?

Like tonight or for life?
Look, just try, okay?

Amy, listen, I'm sorry
for being rude earlier.

I really just wanna say
I am happy for you, okay?

So, if you'd just please refrain
from kissing other guys...

Alex!
What, they don't know?

Can we not do this tonight?
Okay.

What I was trying to say is,

welcome to our incredibly
dysfunctional family.

You're gonna fit right in.

That is seriously the sweetest thing

you've ever said to me.

Okay.

Love you, bro.

You too.
Mm-hm.

And you, I guess.

He's sweet.

What?

(lively rock music)

(sighs) Are you guys serious?

Our older brother died of lung cancer,

and you think it's a
good idea to smoke here?

(man chuckles)

Sorry, dude.

Thank you.

One hour.

(woman clears her throat)

Hey.
You're...

You first.

Your brother died of lung cancer?

Oh, uh, yeah.

This is how I remember him,
it makes me feel closer.

What was his name?

Aron.

My brother's name was
Carter, also in the past tense.

I only bring that up 'cause
he died of lung cancer too.

Do you mind?

Uh, yeah, not at all, go ahead.

How old was Aron when he passed?

20, and Carter?

Also 20.

Sadly, it seems like we
already have so much in common.

Yeah, dead family members
and having brown hair.

I'm weak.

How'd you know?

One of the guys you kicked out of here

went to apologize to
your brother for smoking.

Narc.

All right, so I'm guessing,

you don't have a dead brother either?

You'd be right.

So, what're you doing out here?

Well, I was outside, talking
to a guy named Gary about

his job as a corporate accountant
for Kaiser Permanentic.

Yeah, I thought accountants were aware

that nobody wants to hear about their job.

Then your brother made a quick
announcement, apologizing

for the lowlife on the
patio who's gonna die alone.

I thought, you know, that
sounds like more fun.

So, why don't you wanna be here?

Well, we've all gathered
here to celebrate two people

who made a plan to celebrate
this same shit in the future.

So, it's a little
redundant, in my opinion.

Cynical.

Inside every cynical person,

there's a disappointed idealist.

Hemingway?
Close.

George Carlin. (chuckles)

So, what are you doing at this party?

I live across the street.

Yeah, they invited me to be polite.

I'm guessing they probably
wanted to avoid that

awkward conversation with the
weird girl who's always home.

You're always home?
I work from home.

So is there a live-in boyfriend
or a boyfriend in general?

Skipping the whole "I
work from home" thing?

Well, I'm positive that it has

something to do with the internet.

You're probably like a food
blogger or a YouTube celebrity.

I mean, either way, I'd
be disappointed, so.

Wow, okay, first, no boyfriend.

Second, not a celebrity, I'm a translator.

Okay, so what was your last job?

The United Nations.
Oh, shit.

That's something.

Are you CIA, KGB?

Be honest, are you a spy?

(chuckles) Okay, your turn.

Impress me.

I am a line cook at
a restaurant downtown,

that is famous for steak sandwiches.

That's the moment
you chose to be honest?

Sexy.

I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu.

To make sandwiches.

Everyone likes sandwiches.

You wanna get outta here?

(chuckles) What part
of this conversation

made you think I wanna leave with you?

Just kidding.

Hey, let's go.

â™ª I'm a soldier now â™ª

â™ª Let me show you how â™ª

â™ª Show you how to break â™ª

â™ª I'm a soldier now â™ª

â™ª And the war of love â™ª

â™ª Has brought me to my knees â™ª

[Cook] Red was quite an ambitious color

to wear to someone
else's engagement party.

[Woman] Yeah, I wanted to,
you know, kind of fit in.


I thought you said you live like

five seconds away from there?

I do, but we have to
stop at the store first,

unless you think one bottle's
gonna be enough for tonight.

Then you're buyin'...

You guys comin' from that
ruckus down the street?

No.

No, sir, we're just out for a walk.

This is how it starts.

You know, I moved to this
neighborhood 'cause it was safe.

Fuckin' Obama.

Leaves the borders open.

Little brown people are just
seepin' into this country.

Pretty soon, mark my words,

this place is gonna be
infested with illegal aliens.

You know, I'm gonna have to
start locking everything down

in the front yard here, or
they'll be stealing it all.

You know what I mean?

Totally.

Well, you two have a good
night, you seem like nice kids.

You take care of her now, stay in school.

God bless America.

What a patriot.

[Woman] To say the least.

Should we steal his stuff?

Oh, everything. (chuckles)

â™ª Move closer to me â™ª

â™ª There's no other single
place that I'd rather be â™ª

â™ª You got me twisted and turnin' â™ª

â™ª Got my temperature burnin' â™ª

â™ª I can't stop till I make you mine â™ª

(hushed chatter)

Hey, what're you doin'?


It's started.

â™ª 'Cause I'm waiting and
they're out there shaking â™ª

â™ª Baby, you, you got me thinking of you â™ª

â™ª Lately, now, now I know what to do â™ª

â™ª Come take my hand â™ª

â™ª We can fly up to the stars
till we can't see land â™ª

â™ª Move closer to me â™ª

â™ª There's no other single
place that I'd rather be â™ª

â™ª You got me twisted and turning â™ª

â™ª Got my temperature burning â™ª

â™ª I can't stop till I
make you mine, baby â™ª

(peaceful folk music)

Holy shit.

â™ª Open up your hand, and you'll fall out â™ª

â™ª You fall out, you'll fall â™ª

â™ª Open up your hand, and you'll fall out â™ª

â™ª You fall out, you'll fall â™ª

â™ª Open up your hand, and you'll fall out â™ª

â™ª You fall out, you'll fall â™ª

â™ª Open up my hand â™ª

â™ª And I'll fall out â™ª

(woman moans)

(woman pants softly)

Tonight ended better than I thought.

Eh, it was okay.
Excuse me?

I'm just trying to stall.
What are you stalling?

I don't wanna leave yet.

Did you plan on leaving?

No, I'm just trying to get
myself emotionally prepared

for when you kick me out of here.

You can stay.

Yeah?

I don't think I've ever done that before.

[Woman] What, have sex?

No.
(woman chuckles)

No, like, push a girl's
hair behind their ear.

Mm, never?

[Man] No.

Girls like that.

[Man] Why?

I don't know, I can't explain it.

It makes me feel safe.

And beautiful at the same time.

Don't think I ever wanna leave.

[Woman] Then don't.

That's movin' a little
fast, don't you think?

[Woman] Do you?

Nah.

[Woman] Me neither.

So, it's settled, then.

I'm never leaving.
(peaceful guitar music)

â™ª Put yourself into the
place that's bitter blue â™ª

â™ª Wrap yourself inside
the softly burnt tissue â™ª

â™ª Drop your mind and put it on the shelf â™ª

â™ª Care about others and
worry about yourself â™ª

â™ª And I wanna go to the
place that's bitter blue â™ª

â™ª To the place that's bitter blue â™ª

(man clears his throat)

[Woman] Hey.

Today, you get toast,
as you were too lazy

to cook for yourself.
You just do it better now.

Oh, says the chef who relies
on Chef Boyardee at home.


This better not have been
the moldy bread on the counter

and you just picked off the spots.

You are so weird. (chuckles)

(phone clicks)

How was work?

(phone clicks)

How was work?

Uh, it was fine, just
one job, took 20 minutes.

(phone clicks)
(distant thunder rumbles)

What was it?

Uh, it was correspondence
stuff, textiles or somethin'.

(phone clicks)

Hey.

I'm here.

I hope so.

I need your utilities before next week.

Well, I'm glad you still need me.

[Man] Look, don't be dramatic, Alex.

(phone clicks)
(distant thunder rumbles)

Jaime, stop!

Can we go somewhere?

Why, are you gonna get out of bed?

I will.

You wanna go to Disneyland?

Anything.

Seriously, we can go anywhere.

I'll run your errands with
you, I just wanna be with you.

I know, but you live with me.

Okay, so surprise me, then.

I want mystery.

Wait, is this because I took a piss

with the door open yesterday?


[Alex] Okay.

Alexandra.

Hey.

Look, I'm just finishin'
up work emails, okay?

Give me a few minutes and we
can walk down to the corner

store and I'll get you
that dirty sexy chai.

It's raining outside.

I don't wanna walk out there,
I fucking hate the rain.

Well, it's about to
stop and I love the rain.

(distant thunder rumbles)

Did we move too fast?

(distant thunder rumbles)

On Fridays, all the
foreign exchange kids would

skip class and this one time,
we go back to the dorms,

and we were so drunk, I
couldn't believe we made it,

and everybody passed out, even
though it was like seven PM.

But I stayed up, talking to
this German guy, Christian,

who's actually the
reason I started smoking.

Mm-hm!

And, uh, I don't know, it just happened.

And you were 19?
Mm-hm.

I had dated before that, but,

I was so awkward, I never
really went very far.

Wow, really?

(chuckles) Yeah.

So, when did you lose your V card?

I thought we weren't
supposed to discuss numbers?

I didn't ask you for a number,

I just asked you for the first one.

Yeah, I know, but
you always get so weird

about this kind of stuff.

Come on, you asked me, now go.

How old?

15, like a normal person.
Mm-hm, and to who?

This girl, Becky, a
little neighborhood slut.

(both laugh)

And Jeff.

Wait, (chuckles) what?

Yeah.

[Waiter] Table's ready.

You care to fill me in on the details

of that little number?
(Jaime chuckles)

You can't just drop
something like that, like,

"oh, I lost, my first
time was a threesome."

Okay, okay.

Yeah, so Becky was her name,
and she convinced me to have

a threesome with her and her
goth-ass saxophone teacher.

And he would come over every
Thursday and supposedly

teach her lessons, but her
parents wondered why she

wasn't getting any better and
what they were paying him for.

Anyway, we got really high,

and hooked up in her dad's jacuzzi.

All three of you?
All three of us.

Yeah.
(chuckles) What a creep!

Yeah, yeah, I guess he kinda was.

But you know, I think he hooked up

with a lot of his high school students.

I wonder if he's still teachin'.

In prison.
In prison, probably, yeah.


It's so weird to look
back at it like that.

You know, like it makes me feel so old.

[Jaime] Right?

I mean, I think about middle school kids

doin' half the shit that I used to do.

Oh, they are children.
They're children, thank you.

Thanks.

Children acting like idiots.
Yeah, well...

God, but it's so funny,
'cause at the time,

you think you're so adult, you know?

And looking back, it's
like, no, I was a baby.

I was actually a kid.
Right.

I mean, I think about older
people thinking of what

I was doin' back then, just
fuckin' and smoking weed.

For sure, your parents never
caught you doing that shit?

Like, at least your mom did, right?

But one time, my step
dad caught me in his truck

with this girl and he
beat the shit out of me.

Oh, my god.
Yeah, yeah.

I mean, they knew I was messin' around,

but that was the first time
anybody acknowledged it.

I'm sorry.

Well, I was used to it by then.

And you never knew your real dad?

As well as an
eight-year-old knows anybody.

Is that how old he was
when they got divorced?

No, they never did.

He was hit by a train.

How does that even happen?

By standing in front of it?

[Alex] Oh.

Yeah.

Well, my mom said it was
a blessing in disguise.

'Cause he wasn't a very happy person,

but then again, neither was she, so.

I'm so sorry.

Don't be.

I mean, I turned out all right.

Oh, god.
Right, Alex?

Yeah!
Right?

Yeah, very well adjusted.
I turned out all right.

(chuckles) Idiot.

(Jaime chuckles)

Hey.

They're gonna love you.

[Jaime] Your parents are
nothing like you made them seem.

[Alex] I didn't wanna freak you out.

That was some nice light conversation

we had goin' on in there.

I never thought about building a wall

at the border of Mexico.
(Alex laughs)

I'm sure that'll solve
all of our problems.

Oh, fuck.

I've never spoken to him that way before.

Yeah, well maybe nobody's
spoken to him like that before.

That's the problem.

That's the problem.

That is definitely their problem.

That's definitely the problem.

Wow.

What?

So, what do you wanna do?

You wanna go home?

Hm?

No.

Fuck that.

I feel too good to go home.

Oh!

You feel too good to go home, hm?

Mm-hm.

(Jaime chuckles)

Well...

What should we do?

Hm?

(Alex chuckles)
What should we do?

Skee-ball.

â™ª Strange nature to feel your tether â™ª

â™ª Strange to feel anything at all â™ª

â™ª Strange knowing the
circle goes forever â™ª

â™ª It's hard to tell if
I was bound to fall â™ª

â™ª Spent my whole chasing rainy weather â™ª

â™ª In the rivers and the
valleys of my heart â™ª

â™ª It took some time but
now that we're together â™ª

â™ª Speakin' soft, your
voice inside the dark â™ª

â™ª 'Cause in a new way â™ª

â™ª In a new light â™ª

â™ª We could be there â™ª

â™ª On a new high â™ª

â™ª And if it feels good â™ª

â™ª And if it feels right â™ª

â™ª As imperfect as love is â™ª

â™ª We could coexist â™ª

You were great last night.

(Jaime chuckles)
Thank you.

Well, I stretched, ate a banana.

No, the sex was average.

May have been the most
awkward dinner of my life,

but I'm so proud of you.

Happy birthday, Alex.

Thank you.

What're we gonna do with that?

Mm, compress it?

Oh, could we make a marinara?

With that?
(Alex chuckles)

We grew that, bae!
(Jaime chuckles)

(sighs) You know, it's time to roll.

(Alex moans)
Come on!

I'll make you a special
breakfast for your birthday,

and then take you on a little adventure.

Where?
It's a secret adventure.

I don't like secrets.
Everyone likes secrets.

No, no!
I gotta go.

Come on!

[Jaime] I'm goin' to make you breakfast.

It's my birthday! (groans)

Is this one of your hangover shakes?

Well, it's not my daddy issues

we were drinking away last night.

(chuckles) Oh.

And this will keep you looking young,

long after you should be.

Do I want that?

[Jaime] Everyone wants that.

[Alex] Oh, wait, can
we not do the raw egg?

Why?

It's good for you.

Plus, Arnold told me to do it.

Well, I'm not trying
to be a bodybuilder.

Do you realize how long it would take

for you to actually look like that?

Okay, what about salmonella?
What about it?

It's in raw eggs!

No, it's in every
20,000 organic raw eggs.

Well...

First, why do you know that?

And second, I don't
wanna take that chance.

Life is the chance.

Oh, really?
Yes.

Life is the chance of dying.

If you wanna be a fucking statician,

your chances of getting
shot to death, one in 325.

Your chances of getting electrocuted,

one in 5,000.

Your chances of getting
killed in a plane crash,

also one in 20,000.

So, no going back to Italy for you.

Okay, okay, we get it, we get it.

(Jaime chuckles)

I just like to keep my options open,

if that's okay with you.
It's not okay with me.

'Cause that's your problem.

You're so busy with the what-ifs,

that you're not lookin' at the what-ares.

Oh, is that my problem?
That is your problem.

(chuckles) Oh, thank you for telling me.

Can I put this in the...

(sighs) Do it.

Mm-hm, okay, well, I'm
gonna hop in the shower.

Will you please let me know when

my food poisoning shake is available?

Ah!
(Alex chuckles)

(phone vibrates)

(melancholic music)

â™ª And I don't want you back â™ª

â™ª Sittin' here thinking 'bout â™ª
(Jaime moans)

â™ª How time changes everything and â™ª

â™ª I don't think I'm the same girl â™ª

(Jaime moans)
â™ª Anymore â™ª

â™ª Oh, look and see â™ª

â™ª Sent my world upside-down, inside-out â™ª

â™ª Couldn't get a grip on â™ª

â™ª Oh, anything â™ª

â™ª Since that's the hand I'm dealt â™ª

â™ª I'll find a way to
stand on solid ground â™ª

â™ª On my own â™ª

â™ª Two feet â™ª

â™ª Still I find myself wonderin' â™ª

â™ª Why it all comes out around â™ª

â™ª The same old story,
over and over again â™ª

â™ª Guess I'll try again â™ª

â™ª After all â™ª
(Jaime sobs)

â™ª After all â™ª

â™ª One more thing â™ª

â™ª Wait a minute while the
world is spinning round â™ª

â™ª In your head â™ª

â™ª Loved you with all I could â™ª

â™ª But now it's time
for me to love myself â™ª

â™ª Just as good â™ª

God damn it.

Great!

Thank you.

It's not like this is cliche or anything.


Jaime!

My fucking hair dryer.

Still have the key?

Yeah, I never took it off it.

Balances out my keyring.

All your stuff is in this box.

I kept the juicer, because let's face it,

you don't really use it.

You know, I uh...

I looked up what you yelled
at me out the window.

It's colorful.

Yeah?
Bravo, yeah.

Did you have to look
that up in the dictionary,

or did you have to find like
an actual French prostitute?

You know what, Jaime,
just stop it, okay?

I didn't come here to fight you.

God.


Remember that, huh?

Yeah.

I thought you were gonna burn these

in a witch circle or something.

Look, Alex, I'm not erasing you.

Like I am not pretending
like this never happened.

But you weren't perfect, either.

Well, no one's perfect, okay?

So, you can get over yourself.

You're just coming at me from ego.

Because you were blind-sighted,
and I get it, it's fine.

But just know that
that's what you're doing.

You could just cut the shit, Alex.

I love you.

Jaime.

Really?

[Alex] Yeah.

Why do you love me?
Why do I love you?

You see, you see? (chuckles)

You do that.

You repeat the questions
just so you can like

have more time to think and I hate that.

Why don't you just say
whatever is on your mind?

Just like it's the first
thing that comes out.

Yeah, because your shorts,
they're cute and they're tight.

That's really romantic, Alex.

Yeah, okay, sorry.

Just give me a second!
Okay, just ask me.

Ask you?
Mm.

(chuckles) Right, okay.

So, why do you love me?

You're my nightmare.

After I met you, my fears of
snakes and spiders and heights,

they just seemed so childish
compared to my fear of you with

someone else.

And then...

I saw what you did.

And I realized that we
don't share the same fear.

That is not fair.
Okay.

What, do you think you're so smart,

interpreting what I was doing?

Analyzing that somehow
my definition of love

is inferior to yours?
I didn't say that.

Yeah, but you think it, Jaime!

You think, "oh, I wouldn't
have done anything like that,"

because your feelings are
so much more pure and noble.

Oh, fuck yeah!

You didn't think that
you were gonna have to put

any more work into this relationship?

Holy shit, oh, right.
Yeah, you say, no, look.

You say that you love me.

You say that you're afraid of losing me.

And now what?

You're done?
Look, I put in work, okay?

I changed my fucking work
schedule to fit yours.

I cook for you, I clean for you.

I chose to spend time with you.

Okay, you know what? God
damn, spending time is not work.

That is the good part.

The real work in a relationship
is the exhausting practice

of working through the
little shit that you hate

about each other and trust me,
Jaime, I have done the work.

Oh, really?
Yeah, really.

Okay.
Yeah.

What I did shouldn't be
a no-going-back mistake.

I think it's a matter of opinion.

It's completely irrational.

The way that you were
treating me and the way...

[Jaime] Oh, this is
your fucking phone now.

My phone, what...
Yes, your fucking phone!

You know, on that one thing,

there are 1,000 different
ways for you to cheat on me.

And I hate that thing.

Every time you are on it, I am wondering,

who the fuck are you talking to?

Who are you setting up
your next fuck date with?

That's not what I was doing!

[Jaime] Okay, if only
I could believe you.

Oh.

If the only thing I
had to worry about was

what you were doing when I wasn't around,

I mean, that is one thing.

But what you did...

You were five feet away from me.

I was just talking.

Okay? I was just talking.

I wasn't...

I am sorry that I am, I want
more in my life, Alex, I do.

I am not obligated to stay
in this rent-controlled

rat box forever, just
because I lowered myself

to your fucking standards!
That is so fucked up.

My standards are me.
No.

Jaime, no, my standards are me.

[Jaime] Do not get this twisted.

Hey, you know, why don't you go fuck

one of your little rich buddies?

You know, and see if they'll
give the life that you wanted.

Hm, Jaime?

You know, I'm sorry that I am not sorry,

but that shit doesn't matter to me.

This whole little tough girl
act, I know it's not you.

And that you're just acting
tough so that this hurts less.

So let's just stop, okay?

You know, the only
comfort I have in this,

is knowing that you're
gonna hurt a lot worse.

I'm sorry.

All right? I was scared.

I was scared, baby, I
didn't, come on, please.

What if our flag...

Hey.

Leave my key on the table, all right?

(Alex chuckles)

Fuck.

(moody folk music)

â™ª Have you had any dreams
about me in a while â™ª

â™ª Does it hurt you too much
to forget what you loved â™ª

â™ª Or what used to make you smile â™ª

â™ª Do the clouds in my head
silhouette what I need â™ª

â™ª Or am I stuck in a haze
of the memories engraved â™ª

â™ª On the pieces I'll never read â™ª

â™ª And I saw your love â™ª

â™ª But it couldn't see me â™ª

â™ª Everything you're looking for â™ª

â™ª Is everything I'm trying to be â™ª

â™ª I found your love â™ª

â™ª Standing next to me â™ª

â™ª And everything you're searching for â™ª

â™ª Is everything that I can't see â™ª

â™ª Everything that I can't be â™ª

â™ª Will the trails of our
love ever set with the sun â™ª

â™ª Or will I wander around
in the canyons we found â™ª

â™ª When we were broken and young â™ª

â™ª I've come alive at the
seams of what we used to be â™ª

â™ª Or am I learning enough
to forget what I loved â™ª

â™ª Or what used to set me free â™ª

â™ª I saw your love â™ª

â™ª But it couldn't see me â™ª

â™ª And everything you're looking for â™ª

â™ª Is everything I'm trying to be â™ª

â™ª And I found your love â™ª

â™ª Standing next to me â™ª

â™ª Everything you're searching for â™ª

â™ª Is everything that I can't see â™ª

(peaceful acoustic guitar music)

â™ª In my silence â™ª

â™ª I am myself â™ª

â™ª In my sound, I'm not mine â™ª

â™ª I am everywhere â™ª

â™ª And I am nowhere â™ª

â™ª All at once in my mind â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª In my mind â™ª

â™ª In the right eye â™ª

â™ª I'm authentic â™ª

â™ª In the left, I am a fake â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª In my mind â™ª

â™ª And I don't want to
take over the world â™ª

â™ª I just wanna know where
I belong within it â™ª

â™ª Been fighting myself in the
phone booth for days now â™ª

â™ª It's just so hard to tell
which side is winning â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª In my mind â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª This is all at once â™ª

â™ª In my mind â™ª

(upbeat music)

â™ª They say it rains in California â™ª

â™ª I suppose there are worse things â™ª

â™ª Well, should the rain
begin, I'll just stay in â™ª

â™ª And make you sing to me â™ª

â™ª We will always chase the light shine â™ª

â™ª Shadows always far behind â™ª

â™ª And should we have to sleep â™ª

â™ª I'll always be for him
for all to remind me â™ª

â™ª Of our love, our love, sweet love â™ª

(man speaks foreign language)

Me, I'm a-Mark, Mark, my name's Mark.

I'm the wine rep from West
Wines, are you the owner?

Not yet.

Is she here or...

Nope.

What do you do?

The chef de cuisine.
Ah, very nice, very nice.

Well, what do you say
there, chef du cosine?

Can I buy you a drink?

You, uh, you smell real good.

You like a flower, you know?

Like a really nice-smelling flower?

Hm.
You heard that before?

Oh, I'm sorry, that was my partner.

My figure skating
partner, he's gay, though.

I'm a figure skater. (chuckles)

Really?
Yeah!

I mean, I'm not a professional, but,

I've been doing it since I
was nine, so I'm pretty good.

But you know, the glory days of skating

were really in the 90s.

We didn't have a TV, but my
mom's friend recorded like

every single Winter Olympics from 1980s.

So I would just watch them like
over and over and over again

and my favorite was Nancy Kerrigan.

Oh, she was the best.
She was the best!

Aww, yeah, oh my god, I
just do it now because

I wanna stay in shape, plus
the outfits, they're amazing.

Totally amazing.
Yeah!

The most amazing.

Tonya Harding was my favorite, though.

She really brought the
competition down to their knees.

Wait, that's not funny.

She was amazing, but she had demons.

Wait, are you saying
that because you think

that you're funny or are you saying it

to try to feign interest so
that I'll sleep with you?

Would you be mad if I was
just trying to sleep with you?

Probably not, but, oh my god.

Let me tell you about the French judges.

Don't even get me started.

They are just so much, I just hate them.

Oh my god, there's this one named Pierre.

He is just, I just, oh my god.

What was Pierre like?
Don't even get me, oh.

Sorry, I'm just getting
a Snapchat from my sensei.


Oh.

What belt are you?

There are no belts
in Muay Thai, actually.

That is a common misconception.

Muay Thai is more of a dance.

It's beautiful, but it's also very deadly.

It's violent, but I'm not
training in it so I can kick

some random guy's ass on the
street, even though I could.

I could.
Sure, yeah.

Great, that's good.

But it's an art form and
the Thai history is very rich.

Have you ever seen the movie Ong-Bak?

What was that?
Ong-Bak.

Ong-Bak.

Thai movie, Tony Jaa?

No.
Man.

No, I don't think so.
Yeah, am I boring you?

No, no, not at all.
Okay.

He's this Thai actor,
super sick martial artist.

And this whole thing is like,
here, watch, I'll show you.

So. (clears throat)

Oh, (chuckles) okay.

Come at me.

I'm sorry, you want me to come at...

Come at me.

(chuckles) I don't think...
Just stand up.

Oh, no, no thanks.
Come at me.

Just come at me.
That's okay.

Come at me, bro.
I don't think so, not today.

It's more a second date type thing.

Oh, you're saying you
wanna go on a second date?

(Alex chuckles)
Yes?

It worked!

It worked.

Those Muay Thai moves.
Welcome to my world.

(Alex chuckles)

Well, cheers to that.
Yeah.

Hey, Alex.

I'm not calling to beg for
you back, or to say that I was

wrong or that you were wrong
or anything crazy like that.

I just, I took a little trip, and um,

I just, I see things clearer now.

If you wanna give me a ring,
you know, to talk things out,

or to get anything off your
chest or whatever, I'm here.

And, um, yeah, so give me
a ring, give me a ring,

and then we'll, uh, we'll chat.

Okay.

Okay, cool.
(peaceful guitar music)

â™ª Fair winds and far places â™ª

â™ª In between and distant spaces â™ª

â™ª For you, for me â™ª

â™ª For us â™ª

â™ª Draw you a map of all
the places we've been â™ª

â™ª Yellow can mark where we began â™ª

â™ª Amaliada â™ª

â™ª Amaliada â™ª

Oh, I gotta...
Oh.

Okay.

â™ª We'll sit in the cracks till
the grass meets the masses â™ª

â™ª Goodbye â™ª

â™ª City lights â™ª

â™ª Goodbye â™ª

â™ª City lights â™ª

Hey.

How you doin'?

Good.

I'm on a date.

Good, good.

Me too.

Oh.
Yeah.

Good.

Yeah, mine's into Muay Thai boxing.

It's very bad ass, very intense and...

You know.

That's very dangerous of you.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Mine's a figure skater.
Oh, wow.

She's very flexible.
Okay. (chuckles)

Where is she?

She's, uh, she's grabbing some dinner.

She right there? Yeah.

[Jaime] She's a hell of a cook.

What do you want, Jaime?

I just want, I...

I wanted to tell you that I forgive you

for everything that happened, okay?

And that it's okay that
we're apart right now.

(clears throat) Awesome.
Yeah, excellent.

Wonderful, fuck.
Fuck.

[Mark] Sorry about that,
my mom's goin' nutty today.

What's up?

This is Mark.

Jaime.
Hi.

Hi, Jaime.
Pleasure.

How are you?
I'm well.

Well.
Hi!

And this is Missy, Missy, this is Alex.

Alex, Missy.
Hi, Missy.

Missy, Mark.
Hi, Missy.

Hi, it's so nice to meet you.
Hi, nice to meet you.

My god, you're so pretty.
Oh, thanks!

Yeah.

It was crazy running into you,

but I actually think
that we have to leave.

Wait, how do you two know each other?

We stole a tomato plant.

Mm-hm and an American flag.

And an American flag.
Gangsters.

You guys remind me of my punk rock days.

You were not punk rock.
I am so punk.

I used to have blue hair, I swear to god.

Wait, you guys were like crazy?

Were you like crazy teenagers?

No, we weren't crazy teenagers.

It was last year.
Yeah.

Yeah, nope, totally
used to be punk rock.

I was all into NOFX until they sold out.

But I still steal stuff from Walmart.

That's hard, that's
super hardcore, dude.

(Alex chuckles)

We should go though, right?

Yeah, we're making spaghetti squash.

He's trying to cut back on carbs.

Aww, dieting?

No.

It sounds like you're dieting.

I'm not dieting.
That's good.

I'm not dieting.
It's good for you.

It's a sweet squash, bro.
Yeah, sweet squash, bro.

Thanks, bro.
I do Muay Thai.

Oh, I'm an athlete too, I figure skate!

Really?
Yeah!

Solid, solid.
I can tell.

Yeah, oh wait, hold on.
(phone vibrates)

Hold on a second.

Do you wanna get...
Yes, I do, yeah.

(upbeat music)

â™ª Met her at the Roosevelt Hotel â™ª

â™ª Never seen a girl like you before â™ª

â™ª Walkin' on the beach and I'm all yours â™ª

â™ª Lovin' on the California shore â™ª

Repeat after me.

I take this ring as a sign of my love.

I take this ring as a sign of my love.

And as a symbol that we all share.

And a symbol that we all share.

In token and in pledge.

In token and in pledge.

Of my constant faith and abiding love.

Of my constant faith and abiding love.

Exchange your vows.

Oh. (chuckles)

(clears throat)

Jaime, I must confess, I,

kind of wrote these vows this morning.

(clears throat)

You always say that the
first time I try something,

I usually screw it up
and you're usually right.

But I got this one thing right.

I usually try to play the cynic and find

whatever's wrong with
the situation, but now,

this one time, I can't
find anything wrong,

because you're perfect.

And I vow to always
wave our flag together.

To rob racists together.

To plant our seeds together.

And with my whole heart,

I vow to always be
grateful that I get to be

the one that brushes your
hair behind your ear.

I love you.

I vow to support your dreams,

however outlandish they may seem.

I vow to make you smoothies
when you are tired from cooking,

and keep the statistics on the hold.

I vow to be your rock
when the tides are high,

and your oak when the sun is hot.

And your willow when the storms roll in.

Hey!

What the hell?

Run, run!
Run!

I told y'all twice already!

(elevator dings)
(elevator music)

(group chuckles)

Whoa!

I vow to not get you arrested.

(group chuckles)

Okay, okay, okay.


I need to make it official,
I need to make it official.

Okay, the acceptance of the
offering of their families

that you have each other and the blessings

of all these good people
here with us today.

(group chuckles)

I now pronounce you husband and wife.

Kiss.

Good.

(peaceful atmospheric music)

Oh, it's time to go.
(Jaime squeals)

(Jaime giggles)

â™ª This place is gonna drag me down â™ª

â™ª I can't remember where
I'm supposed to go â™ª

â™ª You think you've got me figured out â™ª

â™ª So light me up, my luminol â™ª

â™ª Watch me glow â™ª

â™ª And I know I don't belong â™ª

â™ª I knew it all along â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I'm just a space cadet â™ª

â™ª With nowhere to lay my head â™ª

â™ª And after all, I can't
know anything at all â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I'm just a space cadet â™ª

â™ª With no one to make my bed â™ª

â™ª So reel me in â™ª

â™ª And just send me off â™ª

â™ª And just send me off â™ª

â™ª Send me off â™ª

â™ª Just send me off â™ª

(Jaime chuckles)

(Alex chuckles)

[Jaime] Ah. (chuckles)

Yeah.

The muscovado was a mistake.

I think the third cotton
candy was actually the mistake.

Cheaper than a
four-tier German chocolate

from Decadent Designs for 120 people.

(groans) Yeah, my
mom's gonna be so pissed.

Totally.

She just inherited a
completely ungrateful,

disrespectful, pain-in-the-ass daughter.

And she doesn't even know it.

Such a good pain in
the ass to have, though.

Aww.

It only took you three-fourths
of a decade to figure it out!

Yeah. (chuckles)
(Jaime chuckles)

Thank you.

You're welcome.

For what?

For being cool with this whole thing.

Well, there was nobody
to pay a dowry to,

so your family can keep the goats.

(Alex chuckles)

I mean for everything.

I know.

And I swear to you,
one day I'm gonna get you

that four-tier Decadent Design cake.

I'm gonna get you the
four-course sea bass.

I'm gonna get you the DJ

who plays way too much Village People.

It was perfect.

It was fun.

Mm-hm.

It was perfect, it was
just, it was novel, all right?

Someday I just wanna get you the...

Stop.

You're not my fairy godmother,
this is the 21st century.

Yeah.


You know, I used to have
to cater these, like,

$100,000 weddings.

Cooking for everybody.

And I used to think what a ridiculous,

extravagant waste of
money they were, but also,

I always thought that I was gonna waste

that money on somebody, someday.

You also thought that
marriage was an outdated

and idiotic institution
designed to make women property.

Well, they are.

(Jaime chuckles)
So, you're mine now.

(both chuckle)


I have no idea what we're gonna do.

Well, we are at least
bound legally now, so,

no matter what happens,
if one of us succeeds,

the other will get something.

I like the way your mind works.

Yeah.

(Alex chuckles)

Oh.

I know we weren't supposed
to do presents or anything,

but I got you a little something.

You're breaking the rules.

It's really small, just take it.

[Jaime] Oh, it's beautiful.

It was my grandmother's.

It was her St. Matthew's pendant.

We weren't religious or anything, but,

she always thought it had magical
powers that kept her safe,

and I...

I liked the idea of you
always being safe, so.

So, what is he, like, the patron saint

of protection, or love or...

Accounting.

(both laugh)

Apparently, he was the
Jewish tax collector

who worked for the Romans.

Grams never knew that, I just
let her live in ignorance.

Got a St. Matthew, the
Internal Revenue Saint.

(both chuckle)

Don't go convertin' on me.

I love it, thank you.

[Alex] I'm glad you like it.

So, as long as we are
already on that subject,

I got you something too.

(gasps) You're breaking the rules too?

Birds of a feather.

Hm.
Here.

Aww.

Thought I already had
the key to your heart?

I will drown you in the ocean right now,

you cheesy bastard.

Sorry.

Key to the dog house, got it.

No, it's to a run-down
shack on Mar Vista.

You're gonna keep me that far away now?

No.

It's the old Husure.

The one that we were looking at?

Yeah.

Oh, my god.

It's gonna need some
work, but, it's yours.

My restaurant?
Yes.

No, but we looked at
it, we can't afford it.

I might have pulled some strings.

What strings?

It was gonna be like four years

before we had a down payment, we can't...

Maybe I took out a couple of loans,

and we may have to move into the attic,

and I may have told your dad
it was for a real wedding.

(Alex chuckles)

You lied to Roger?

He's gonna be furious.

He deserves it.

He so deserves it.
Mm-hm.

(Alex sighs)

I believe in you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Alex.

[Alex] Yeah.

We still have to have
our first official dance.

But we had it with Mr. Dance-A-Thon.

[Jaime] No, like the slow
kind, silly. (chuckles)

Okay, are you gonna sing?

Get your phone, come on.

â™ª Oh, my little gypsy girl â™ª

â™ª Pull out all the stops for her â™ª

â™ª Oh, my little gypsy girl â™ª

â™ª And if you wanna see this land â™ª

â™ª I will be your gypsy man â™ª

â™ª She hangs up all the stars like pearls â™ª

â™ª My little gypsy girl â™ª

â™ª Hangs up all the stars like pearls â™ª

â™ª My little gypsy girl â™ª

â™ª I pull out all the stops for her â™ª

â™ª My little gypsy girl â™ª

â™ª And if you wanna see this land â™ª

â™ª I will be your gypsy man â™ª


Just a minute, please.

Jaime, they're ready for you now.

Just a minute.

It's five minutes.

It'll be over and you
can leave, I'll clean up.

(Jaime sighs)

If there's fucking sub
sandwiches out there...

Alex would be appalled.

"Plebeian food."

Maybe you have been spoiled
for the last 20 years.

This is how we do it, Jaime.

We get up, we put on our faces,

and we go and do what needs to be done.

I don't know half
those people out there.

[Woman] Well, they knew Alex.

I don't care.


Alex was my child.

Long before you were married.

You don't have exclusive
rights to this grief.

And neither do I.

We share this.

And so do they.

Now.

If my memory's correct...

You have a promise to keep.

It's gonna be so bad.

â™ª There's a ghost in this house
and she watches me sleep â™ª

â™ª She leaves doors unlocked
and she's light on her feet â™ª

â™ª There's a ghost in this house
and she rattles my bones â™ª

â™ª She's haunting my heart
and shaking my soul â™ª

Alex, my love.

The award-winning culinary artist,

was a fiery sex puppet.

Because of his natural athleticism,

he was simply out of my control.


Alex's sex life was lived
outside of the bedroom.

In the living room as
well, and the garden,

where you are all gathered today.

Everything he did when it came to work,

or that one half of a half-marathon,

beginner's swing dancing,
not paying bills on time,

knowing what offsides means in football,

and not being a cheating
asshole like his dad, Roger.

He did what he wanted
without fear of failure,

and did it well, a true bad ass.


I loved Alex madly.

I worshiped the...

I loved Alex madly.

I worshiped the ground
my husband walked on.

He truly just wanted one thing.

He wanted to make sure I, Jaime,

knew how much love he felt for me,

and the infinite amount of
love he tried to give back.

He wanted me to know how
beautiful the world became

when he saw it through my eyes.

And how he will be
forever grateful for that.

So, there you have it.

Alex, one boss, hot-as-hell bad ass,

brilliant bombshell minx,
who should've been a spy.

Also, global warming is real,
Roger, stop being a dick.

Hashtag best eulogy ever.

I'm out, bitches.

Peace.

â™ª Every knock on the wall,
every motionless creak â™ª

â™ª Someday she'll be gone,
then maybe I'll rest â™ª

â™ª All alone in my bed
till I miss her to death â™ª

â™ª All alone in my bed
till I miss her to death â™ª

â™ª There's a ghost in this house
and she talks in her sleep â™ª

Every word, you promised.



Oh, just by your evil laugh, I can tell,

I am gonna regret this decision.

(Alex chuckles)

No, you can't look.

That's the whole deal, not
until you're up at the podium.

And if you cheat I will haunt
you for the rest of your life.

And that's supposed to scare me?

Yes, it is.

You're afraid of me in real
life, just wait till I'm a tree

or a supernatural being or something.

I'll make the Texas Chainsaw
Massacre guy look like

fucking Matilda.

[Jaime] Fine.

Hey, Barb, how do you spell ejaculate?

What?

I'm kidding.

Calm down!

Maybe kidding.

(Jaime chuckles)

I'm gonna take off for the night.

You guys okay?

I have cancer.

Hey, Alex.

Thanks, Barb.

Sorry about...
I'm fine, Barb.


Alex?
Mm, yeah.

E-J-A-C-U-L-A-T-E.

[Jaime] Not funny,
Barb, not funny at all.

I actually don't like that word.

Think I'll avoid it.

Lucky.

(Jaime sighs)

So, you've been goin' for a while now.

How long am I gonna be up there for?

I don't know, this is a first draft.

Do you wanna invite your dad?

Oh, yeah, make sure
he's there. (chuckles)

Okay, it's your funeral.

Good one.
Thank you.

How are you feeling?
I'm a little tired.

Maybe you should, uh...

No, not yet, I'm almost
done, I'm almost done.

Okay, I think I'm done.

Great.
No, no, wait, wait.

Oh, wait. (chuckles)
(Jaime sighs)

"Suck that."

Okay, I am done.

Are you sure?

Yeah.

Jaime, you are a very talented writer.

Scary talented, I'm sure.

(Alex chuckles)

You know what, can
we just take this off?

[Jaime] Yeah.

So, one more?

You're finally catching on.
Yeah.

(Alex retches)

(Alex groans)

All of the thin ones were in
the wash, I found this big guy.

You know, just holler if you get too hot.

Just let me know, all right?
Thank you, thank you.

Yeah, no problem.

Alex.
Look, I'm fine, I promise.

No, I'm gonna go see
if I can't find Barb.

No, don't.

Look, why not?

Will you just sit here with me, please?

She's probably still here.
Jaime, sit down.

Take my hand.

Oh, my god.

(Alex chuckles)

I'm fine, nothing's wrong,
I just, if you call her,

the moment she comes in here,
she'll give me something

that puts me out and I
don't want that right now.

I'm having too good of a day.

You consider this a good day?

Yeah, I haven't laughed
this long in a while.

I'm exhausted.

Why don't you go to sleep?
Mm, no, not yet.

I like right now.

Tell me a story.

A story?

You know all my stories.

It doesn't have to be about you.

You know all my stupid stories.

Okay, tell me a funny one.

A funny one?
A true one.

A true one, a funny true story?

Something I've never been told before.

All right.

Okay, hold on.

In 1989, Mexico City,
(peaceful atmospheric music)

was dealing with their biggest pollution

and traffic problems
ever, it was unbearable.

So the government decided they
had to do something about it.

They had to come up with a solution

to solve this traffic crisis.

So, they came up with a plan that depended

on the last digit of
your license plate, okay?

If it was odd, then you
could drive on these days.

If it was even, then you can
drive on these days, right?

They predicated that
this would ease traffic,

that it would solve
the problem of exhaust,

that it would cause cars to
be exported out of the city,

'cause people wouldn't be drivin' as much.

Seems like a pretty wise plan, doesn't it?

[Alex] Yeah.

So what do you think happened?

Did they enforce it?

Yeah, they did.

Then it worked?
Nope.

Why?

Because people, they
just bought more cars,

so that they could drive on the day

that they couldn't drive before.

Exacerbating the pollution problem,

because they were just
buying crappy old cars.

In turn, it made Mexico City
the biggest polluting city

in North America.

Sorry, that didn't make any sense, did it?

No, but it was funny. (chuckles)

It was funny, thank you.

[Jaime] Look, you should
really get some rest, okay?

Jaime.

[Jaime] What's goin' on?

I've always been so sure about
every decision I ever made.

Even if it became a mistake,
I've just been sure.

You know that.

I love that about you.

Choosing you was the most unsure,

scariest moment of my life,

and I only just now realized why.

And why is that?

It's because it wasn't
my choice to begin with.

It just happened without me
knowing, so it felt different.

Somewhere along the way,

it could've been when I first met you,

but it happened.

And we laughed and screamed
and we fought to protect it.


The same butterflies I felt
the first time I saw you,

I still have today.

I don't think we can take
credit for the first ones, but,

the way I felt when I heard
your footsteps come in the door?

We earned that.

That was earned.

Hey, Jaime.

Just because I'm gone, doesn't
mean it can't happen again.

No, I can't.

Hey.

Life could always be worse.
Oh, yeah, how is that?

Driving in rush hour in Mexico City.

(Jaime sobs)

It's okay.

It's okay.

(Jaime sobs)

Come up here.

Come on.

(peaceful atmospheric music)

(food sizzles)

Good morning, Jaime.

(Jaime speaks foreign language)

Good morning, you want the usual, sweetie?

Yes.
Okay.

Now, what have we here?

Three-letter word, a cool can.

Ice.

Perfect.

How are you doing?
Oh, you know, the usual.

Your bagel should be out in just a second.

Thank you.
Yeah.

How's it goin'?
Good.

[Waitress] Good, what can I get for ya?

I'd like to have a
peppermint herbal tea, please.

All right, you got it.
Thanks.

Are you stuck?

[Jaime] Yes.

Well, maybe I can help.

Six-letter word.

Solanaceae.

Fruit from Mexico, good for the heart.

Orange?

Orange I tried, it
contradicts four-down.

[Waitress] Oh, I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

I'm sure.

Nightshade.

Too long.

Nope.

Solanaceae is a nightshade,
it's a plant from Mexico

and it spread through colonization.

Debatably, it's a vegetable too,

but there are over 10,000
varieties worldwide.

Tomato.
Tomato.

Tomato.

Tomato is a plant that was originally

harvested by the Mayans.

It has a lot of lycopene in it
which is good for the heart.

(bright atmospheric music)

â™ª I know you want it, you got it â™ª

â™ª And honest, you oughta
just take a long walk â™ª

â™ª This ain't the summer you
thought you were dreamin' up â™ª

â™ª Six months ago â™ª

â™ª Where has the time gone â™ª

â™ª What happened to Mexico â™ª

â™ª No reason to ride on anymore â™ª

â™ª And with the punches we
roll, I even sing along â™ª

â™ª I met a girl and she
plays like a favorite song â™ª

â™ª For some reason, I'm lost â™ª

â™ª And love feels so far from home â™ª

â™ª And it reads like a short novel â™ª

â™ª And it goes on and on â™ª

â™ª It goes on and on â™ª

â™ª Just like a dream â™ª

â™ª Yeah, it's just like a dream â™ª

(upbeat music)

â™ª Met at the Roosevelt Hotel â™ª

â™ª Never seen a girl like you before â™ª

â™ª Walkin' on the beach and I'm all yours â™ª

â™ª Lovin' on the California shore â™ª

â™ª Now I'm thinking am I dreaming â™ª

â™ª Wake me up from this feeling â™ª

â™ª She hangs up all the stars like pearls â™ª

â™ª My little gypsy girl â™ª

â™ª Pull out all the stops for her â™ª

â™ª My little gypsy girl â™ª

â™ª If you wanna see this land â™ª

â™ª I will be your gypsy man â™ª

â™ª She hangs up all the stars like pearls â™ª

â™ª My little gypsy girl â™ª

â™ª Waited seven years now for tonight â™ª

â™ª There's never been an
angel dressed so white â™ª

â™ª We talk about the Roosevelt Hotel â™ª

â™ª And dancing to our
song you know so well â™ª

â™ª Now I'm thinking ain't this something â™ª

â™ª I promise you a whole life's loving â™ª

â™ª She's hangs up all
the stars like pearls â™ª

â™ª My little gypsy girl â™ª
