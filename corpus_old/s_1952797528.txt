No.

Please... Please.

l beg you.

l beg you.

l'm only here to help you.

Hello. Uffizi.

Fucking pig.
This is going to hurt.

You want me. don't you?
Take that cross and shove it up your ass.

Oh. not nice.

l want to lick you

and suck you dry.

Uffizi. no!

No!

Death...

is the inevitable consequence of life.

Our bodies are doomed to fail.

Some. unfortunately.

are doomed to fail sooner than others.

Failure is the most important lesson

you will learn
in the medical profession.

Some of you secretly
indulge the conceit

that you will succeed
in the face of God.

that you will learn to defy death.

l know.

l did too. once upon a time.

Are you lovebirds quarrelling again?
No.

We're just discussing Lizzie's
favourite subject. my impending demise.

That's it. l'm outta here.
No. no. l'm done. l swear. Honest. OK?

All better.

Where's Kenny?
There. paying down his student loans.

Could you be more obvious?
What?

You were dealing drugs
to Professor Whelan?

Knock-off Viagra. actually.
He'll be fishing on that rod all week long.

And you're all right with that?
As long as his old lady's cool.

Here.

Would you put that thing away?

Lost again.
Here. Hose down those willies. girl.

l can't. lt's a work night.

You'll put him to bed?
No. l'll stick a light bulb up his ass.

Turn him into a beer sign.

Home by midnight. l mean it.
Get outta here. Mom. Kids wanna play.

Midnight.

Here's to MOB.
What's MOB?

Money Over Bitches.

Fire sale. Where do you want him?
Put him on four.

On four.

We got something special for you today.
What do we got?

Homicide. suicide.
natural causes. or what?

l'm gonna go with ''or what''.
One. two. three. lift.

Grabbed him on a field
near Jackson Square.

Someone hung him on a cross
and burned him alive.

That's pleasant. That's really nice.

All dressed up for Ash Wednesday.

Blessed and cremated at the same time.
Later.

Do you mind giving me a hand here?
Boss left early.

l got a midterm in 90 minutes. No one
told me l'd have to process another DB.

Are you kidding? l love this shit.
Thanks.

OK. We're definitely
gonna need some dental plates.

Can a body burn this much on its own?
Not without an accelerant.

Get me some scrapings. will you?

Excellent.

That's weird.
These burns are mostly superficial.

Hey. Luke. check this out.

Liver and all the other organs are white.
like they've never touched a drop of blood.

You know what this means. don't you?
Educate me.

He got his blood from somewhere else.
Come on.

You have a better explanation?
Contact with water turns liver tissue white.

Elizabeth. the guy was found
hanging from a cross. burning.

At dawn.

No way. No.

Check his teeth.
No. no. This is crazy.

Tell me l'm bullshitting. Check his teeth.
Fine.

l guess l'm full of shit.

That's weird.

Christ!
What?

Oh. shit.

Shit. l was right.

l was right!
Shit. we've got a vampire.

We bagged us a vampire. We bagged
us a vampire. We got us a vampire.

Oh. shit.

l'll be right back.

Where are you going?

Yeah?
Lowell. OK. don't go all academic on me.

Lizzie. what...?
l got something down here.

Something that can't exist. but it does.

At least. l think it does.

You found a what?

A vampire?
You don't believe me. do you?

Well. it's not that l don't believe you.
l just...

You know. l understand. really.

l mean. God. l wouldn't believe me either.
especially if l was you.

You may look dead...

Garden room.

You have a body on your slab
unlike any other you have seen.

Who is this?
Opportunity.

l want the body
and l'll make you rich to get it. Hello?

A body was delivered here in the last hour.
badly burned.

There was the strangest call just now.
Who was it?

l haven't a clue. but whoever it was just
offered 30 million large for our friend here.

l'm waiting for the punch line.
You just heard it.

What does this mystery caller
want with the body?

Do the math. 30 mil is pocket change if we
can figure out what makes this thing tick.

lmmortality on sale
at a morgue near you.

Wait. OK. hold on a minute.
We need to think this through.

Why don't we get some experts in here?

Who? The CDC?

The FBl? The NRA?
Fucking Pete Corello?

Jesus. Elizabeth. think. Why is it that not
one single vampire has ever been found?

lt's because they disappear.
or someone makes them disappear.

along with any credible witnesses.
Men in black.

Remember the John Doe from the fire?
No. no. we can't.

We'll make a switch. Who's gonna know?
Luke!

So they get some drunk
instead of a vampire. So what?

They'll put the body away
in some secret stash.

This is insane.
No. Elizabeth. Not doing this is insane.

$30 million. $30 million for the secret
of eternal life. or business as usual.

Excuse me.
Yes?

l'm here to give last rites.
lt's a little late for that. isn't it?

Never too late to save a soul.
Someone'll help you in a minute.

l don't have a minute.

Can l help you with something?

Yes.

Yeah. it must be this one.
Thank you.

What the hell took you so long?
Go. go. go!

Mr Big wants us to meet him
at the last turn-off before the interstate.

Fuck me. Shit. Fuck.

Get out. l'm driving.

Elizabeth Blaine.

You don't know who this investor is
or even if his money is real.

l know. Lowell. l know.
Like l said. l just...

l'm not condoning what you did.
Elizabeth. not for a second.

but there's a right way
to do the wrong thing.

That's all l'm saying.
We have to protect ourselves.

OK. Then...

all l can say is...

is welcome aboard.

Just listen.
Here's what l want you to do.

Take the body
to my parents' old house.

The place is a wreck
but it's empty and it's isolated.

We can start testing it there.

and find out what it really is before
we bring in your man with the money.

When will Lowell be here?
About two hours.

He and the guys
had to make a pick-up.

A pick-up of what?
350 pints of blood. give or take.

l guess it pays to be connected.

Lowell got the research grant
to put UNO on the map.

They'd probably have given us the blood.
Sure. if we hadn't stolen it already.

lsn't that right. Lowell?

OK. lowlifes. that'll do.

Clamp on.

Secure his hands and legs.
Sure.

Like he's gonna be going somewhere.

He's good to go.

Poor little asshole.

March 1 0. First trial.
To infinity and beyond. sweetie.

l don't know about this. guys.
l think l prefer the guy dead.

My mom says it takes one person
to do something stupid.

but it takes a whole bunch of people
to do something really stupid.

Fuck it. Think about the money.

Now...

let's immerse him.
Enough talking. Let's dunk him.

All right. Come on. Luke.
All right. Watch the cord.

Put that over there.
Careful.

Easy.
You got him?

OK.

OK.

Ready?

All right. Let it go. Let it go.

All right. he's in.

All right. l'm hooked over here.
OK.

All right. He's all locked in.
What now?

All right. guys. From here on out.
whatever happens happens.

lt's been. like. two hours
and not even so much as a ripple.

The dude is dead. man.

Maybe we need virgin blood.

Why?

Didn't Elizabeth BÃ¡thory
always bathe in virgin blood?

No. No. cos when my blood
touched its skin. it reacted.

There goes the virgin theory.

l was acing ethical problems
in modern medicine this semester.

Come on. Do something.

Anything.

All right. All right.

We fish him out. All right?

See what happened. or didn't.

l think we melted him.

Somebody wanna tell me
what's going on up there?

Nothing. This is just such a...

Oh. God!

Oh. God!

Grab him!

Stake it!
Get the blood off.

Stake it!

Get the blood off!
Stake it. Hurry!

Staking it won't be necessary.

lt's a sun gun.

Who the fuck are you?
l'm the money. But you can call me Eric.

We're so screwed.

We have to call the police.

Are you kidding?
How are we gonna explain this?

We can't just leave her here.
Kenny's right. No police.

What? lt's over. Lowell.

You understand? lt's over.

l don't know what the hell happened
up there. l don't even wanna think about it.

But Tanya's dead.
We have to deal with that.

All of us.

Elizabeth. we can't help Tanya.

Not now.

Think about what we saw.

what we learned.
what we can still learn.

Am l supposed to be
comforted by that?

My God. What is happening here?

Forget it. We have to call it in.

There's no other way.

Luke?

Luke.

l don't believe it.

l think what they're trying
to say. Elizabeth.

is that we've all just crossed the Rubicon.
There is no going back.

Forget the fuckin' Rubicon.
What about our money?

First. l only represent the money.

and second. it seems
l'm the only one around here

who's been acting in good faith.

So l propose we all start
working together on the off chance

that some good
can still come out of this nightmare.

Good. l believe there's usually
a shovel in the barn.

l'm so sorry. Tanya.

l'm so sorry.

Stake it! Stake it! Hurry!

lncredible.
The electronics don't record him at all.

Of course he doesn't show up
on a video monitor. He's a fucking vampire.

Where is she?
Your girlfriend?

lt's a sun gun.
His girlfriend.

Who the fuck are you?
l'm the money. But you can call me Eric.

lt's all been arranged. We'll move
the subject to a more secure location.

begin testing it for real.

How much more real
does it have to get?

We know he's alive. Kenny.

We just don't know
what's keeping him alive.

Or if that essence can be transferred
to somebody else.

l just got through planting my best friend
in somebody's back yard.

Excuse me if l don't give a shit.

Unless this essence can bring her back.
l'm just here to get my money.

Tanya's dead. lt doesn't work on cells
that are already dead.

No?

Well. how does it work. Lowell?

Does it work on diseased cells?

Would it work on that? Cells from some
palsied piece of shit in a wheelchair who...

Oh. my God. that's you!
You're missing the big picture.

Sure. You won't just be sitting there with
your Nobel prize. you'll be dancing with it.

l suggest keeping your students in line.
Professor.

This won't go well for any of us.
Thank you for the advice.

lron chains painted with liquid silver.

ln his weakened state.
they should hold him easily.

Weakened state. my ass.

lf you ask me. he's looking better.
even without our help.

Ultraviolet light.

He gets out of line. you dial this up.

Turn it down.

Turn it back down!

Any of you come down here.
wear your shades or you'll fry your retinas.

Oh. and be sure to keep
the generator fuelled at all times.

You should all get familiar with these.
in case you need to use them.

Spear guns.
The harpoons have been plated with silver.

so please. don't bang them around.
or it'll flake off.

Shooting him through the heart
will certainly slow him down.

Now. here's a testament
to Ockham's razor.

Elizabeth?

You OK? Elizabeth!
l'm fine. l'll be out in a minute.

OK.

Why do we get stuck
with all the disturbing-the-peace calls?

Some chick screaming
her head off all night.

Come on. man. l call that a party.

l'm telling you. Hodge. Fletcher would have
you running here every time his dog barks.

That's not all.
Last night Fletch calls up St Jude's.

Tells Father Harry there's some kind of
demonic ritual going on out here.

like he expects Harry to send out
his favourite exorcist or something.

l'd pay to see that.

Hello?

Holy Christ.

Police. Get up.

Slowly.

Now turn around.

You an exorcist?

Not exactly.

Put your hands on your head
and turn back around slow.

There's no need for that. officer. l'm done
here. l'll leave you to your crime scene.

Jesus. What the hell happened here?

Jimmy!

Jimmy. get up here! Now!

lt's best if everyone stays calm.

You answer me. man.

What the hell are you doing here?

Friends forever?

When we were in the tub.
he must have bit me.

How sick is that?

Your lucky day.

Close your eyes. officer.
and count your blessings.

When you open them.
this will all be over.

This is a scraping of skin from our subject
before we immersed it in the tub.

and this blood is from Kenny.

Regular unleaded.

Look at the replication.

lt's just like...

cancer.

but without the chaos.
Amazing.

That's not the question.
We're getting to that.

Not fast enough.
Are you OK?

l just wanna get the answer we came for
and get this over with.

We're here to see what its blood can do.
so let's get on with it.

OK.

We'll need to draw at least 25cc
of our new friend's blood for starters.

Any volunteers?

Who's your daddy?

Where's Luke?

Good question.

Don't ask.

You are not like them.

Take from me.

but first...

you must stop...

the sun.

Dial down the lights. All the way.
Fuck that.

lf you want the blood.
then dial down the lights.

Bloody Americans.

Neck.

Everything you know...

is about to end.

You can see from these samples how
my muscle fibre has deteriorated over time.

You'll have to admit.

l'm pretty much
the poster boy for cellular degeneration.

We all gotta be good at something.
Right. Lowell?

That's right. Kenny.
Do the honours.

Now let's see
what the vampire blood does.

That doesn't look good.

lt's killing off the host cells.
Wait.

What's going on?

They're taking over.

lf it's replacing the cells it's killed.
when do you stop being you?

lt won't change who you are.
just make you better.

lt'd turn you into fucking Superman!
Or pure refried evil.

Where have you been. Luke?
Shopping.

You know. evil's just a state of mind. fella.
that's all.

He's right. you know.
lt's just a subjective term.

Meaningless in a clinical setting.

ls it? ls this the new you. Lowell?

Here's the new you on holy water.

lt's fucking acid.
You threw fucking acid on it!

So what are you saying?

What l'm saying is that
that thing out in the pool is a monster.

l know better than you cos l stole it.

Don't pretend it's something else.
We all know what it is.

No. what are you really saying?
Are you with us or against us?

l gotta know who my allies are.

Answer me when l talk to you!
That's enough.

Now. you listen to me.
We are all in this together. right?

Nobody's backing out here.
so let's just take it down a notch.

OK?

OK?
OK.

We all know it's a vampire.
Nobody's kidding themselves here.

The trick is to separate the disease vector -
the evil. if you will - from the cure.

Right. Like a vaccine.

Where you take what makes you sick
and you turn it into a cure.

For lack of a better term. yes.
Get my point. Luke?

Yeah. Lowell.

l get your point.

That dude is a major-league liability.

Why the seeds?
Vampires are compulsive counters.

He'll want to stop and count every one
before moving on.

And the net?

They can't pass any knot
without untying it.

Where do you get this stuff?

Basic cultural literacy.
Hey. Luke.

l know how you feel.

All l'm asking is you give them a chance
to see if any good can come out of this.

Elizabeth. let's just call this for what it is.
OK? This is all about Lowell.

Yeah. it is.

l'm sorry. l've been watching
the only man l ever loved

die inch by inch
over the last three years.

Three years!
l know that. but that's not...

No. no.

Lowell is everything to me.

You understand? Everything.

Do you know why
l took that job down at the morgue?

No. Tell me.
Lowell made me do it.

Yeah. He said that l didn't believe in death.
couldn't handle it. didn't think it was real.

l still can't handle it. Luke.

We lost Tanya.
Please don't make me lose Lowell as well.

Can l help you. Father?

My name is Uffizi.
l come at the behest of Father PÃ©rigord.

Who is it. Paul?
Father Uffizi.

Father PÃ©rigord sent him.
What brings you here?

l understand a man
was seen stealing holy water.

How do you know that?
You mentioned it to Father PÃ©rigord.

l'd like to talk to the boy who saw him.

He has basketball practice till five.

l'll wait.

l don't want trouble.
Excuse me?

l've heard the stories. Valestrama. Tibet.

lf what they say is true. then
you have committed unspeakable acts.

Then God will judge me.

Not you.

Show him downstairs.
And see to whatever else he needs.

Luke.
Bad time. Lowell.

l need you to understand...
l need you to understand.

She's too good for you.

Maybe. Maybe you're right.

But don't forget one thing.
What's that?

Despite my obvious limitations.
she chose me. not you.

So l suggest you get over it.

Once again.
he's free in the world.

l'll do what l must. Your Eminence.
As always.

He's not like the others. you know.
He was the first.

The betrayer.

An immortal being. cursed by God.

His face may change
with each regeneration.

but the evil within him is constant.

Any harm you do to his body
will be meaningless - meaningless -

unless you can set his soul free.

He is not deserving.
All men are deserving. All men.

We are not just
the instruments of God's vengeance.

Even you.

Yes. Your Eminence.

You must grant him absolution.

Only forgiveness can end his damnation.
and allow him to die.

Remember. Christ forgave.

And. in the end. so must we all.

Elizabeth.
''Oath of God'' in Hebrew.

is it not?

The noble caretaker of the dead.

giving names to the nameless.
comfort to the damned.

And now. taker of blood.

What's wrong. bloodsucker?

Did you think my blood
would be limitless?

Better that you protect
what you already have

than seek more where there is none.

Oh. yeah.

This is it.

Kenny?
l'm sorry. Professor.

Couldn't wait.

Hope this won't affect my grade.

l was flunking anyway.

That's OK. Really.

l've got this whole new take on medicine.
Very Darwinian.

lt's called survival of the...

What is that word?
Kenny...

No. no.

Don't tell me. l've got it right here.

On the tip of my tongue.

lt's...
Lowell?

Better get back to your honey.

Kenny? Lowell?

Where's Lowell...
What's going on?

What do you think?
Kenny took off with the last blood sample.

Don't look at me!

There's more where that came from.

The vampire's dry.
Tell me there's more!

The blood we had just ran out that door.
Hey. asshole!

Stand back. you fucking Yank.

Better keep that thing close by.

Help me.
Are you all right. honey?

Up. up and away.

What are you doing?
Protecting our investment.

Nice.

Almost makes you dizzy. doesn't it?

Lowell? Oh. God. Lowell!

Lowell! You OK?

Jesus...

Lowell...

Oh. God...

This is my fault.

l made this happen.

There's a pulse.
lt's weak. but it's there.

Luke. help me.
Help me get him into the locker room.

What the fuck...?

Get the fuck down!

No! No! No!

Come here. You know what l got?

l got hooya power.
Kenny. wait.

Shut the fuck up.

You little prick.
you were gonna spoil my party.

No. no. no.

What have we got here?

You here to give me a whipping. Dad?
Have l been that bad?

l'm not what you think.
You're exactly what l think.

You want my soul. Father?
Do you want my soul? ls that it?

No. God gets your soul.
l just want your head.

Oh. God. No. please.

Where is it?
What?

Play games. you die.

l don't know
what you're talking about.

Where's the body?

Not far. Not far.

Six or seven blocks east.

Old swimming pool.

Tell them l'm coming.
Yes.

Yes. l will.

l thought you said
that thing was bled dry.

l'm not taking blood. Luke. l'm giving it.

What?

Why?
lt needs to replenish.

Oh. no. l know what you're thinking.
There's nothing you can do for Lowell now.

l have to try.
What if you get infected?

lt's a little late for that. don't you think?

Jesus. When?

Back in the morgue.
l cut my finger on its tooth.

You mean this whole time you...?
l haven't turned.

Not yet. as far as l can tell. Look. look.
My body's fighting the infection.

Luke. if we save Lowell
he can find a cure and save us both.

You have to help. Luke.

Jesus.

Stay away!

Get back!
l'm only here to help you.

l killed my own cat.

How could l do that? How?

What's wrong with me?

lf that thing
so much as twitches.

l'm frying the bastard and
pulling you off the line. You understand?

You sure about this? lt's not too late.

Yeah.

Elizabeth?

We are the only truth. Elizabeth.
There is no other.

Elizabeth?

Who are you?
Who am l?

Gilles de Rais... Vlad Tepes... El Hazarid...

Dagobert... Proximus... Uther... Caligula...

lscariot.

And so many more that l've long forgotten.

Elizabeth!

Are you all right?
l don't know.

What happened? Where's Kenny?
Dead. Very dead.

You killed him?
Yes.

No. No. somebody beat me to it.

And that same son of a bitch
is coming for us.

Just one guy?
One guy. One guy?

Yeah!
Yes. one guy!

And here's the kicker.
He's a bloody priest.

Priest?
Priest from hell.

Whipped Kenny's head clean off.

lt's the guy from the morgue.
Elizabeth. Elizabeth!

Where's Lowell?

He got hurt.
How bad?

Bad.

Where is he?
Where is he?

No!
Stay back.

Eric. come on.

That fuck's...
Listen.

lt is down to you and me. man.
OK? We can't go losing it now.

You said he's coming.
How long until he gets here?

l don't know. l don't know. He went
to deal with some bird that Kenny...

Ten minutes. maybe less.

Lowell?
Come back to me. please.

Lowell.

Lizzie?
Yeah. it's me. l'm here. l'm here.

Help me up.
OK. take it easy. OK? Take it slow.

OK?

OK. All right. OK.

Hold on.
Can you hold onto my shoulders?

OK. You ready? You ready?

Up.

You're OK. Come on. Hold on. Steady.

OK. OK.

Are you all right?

What's it like?

What's it like?

lt's like...

sex.

Oh. yeah.

Yeah.

OK.

OK. lemme go.

You sure?
Yeah. let me go.

Yeah.
Welcome back.

Sorry. lt's...

not that l don't appreciate
everything you've done for me. Lizzie.

l really. really do.

lt's just that. well.
we've reached the end of the line.

l don't understand. l thought...

You thought what?

That we were in love?

No. no. You were in love.

l was in need.

l don't believe you.

You don't believe me?
Let me paint a little picture for you. Lizzie.

Your investor?
The mystery man with the money?

The one who called Luke in the morgue.
put this whole crazy thing together?

You were sleeping with him.

No.
That's right. Twisted limbs and all.

Love hurts. bitch.

Yeah.

Eric's an old pal from college.
And he's quite the handyman.

Unfortunately.
like myself. he's flat-out broke.

But not for long.

1 5 years ago. l was a struggling
medical student. just like you.

And l worked in a morgue. just like you.

And then one day it happened.
Something l couldn't explain.

A vampire. a revenant being.

showed up on my slab.

And before l even had time
to think about it.

this old priest comes.
and he claims the body.

Then he asks me if anyone's examined it.

And l can see in his eyes:
if l say yes.

l'm dead.

And then the implications hit me.

The possibilities. The power!

And so l went across the country
working at morgue after morgue.

hoping that l'd find another one.

And then. my body began to fail.

And l needed eyes and ears.

Someone to help me do
the things that l couldn't.

Did you think you were the first one?

You were the fifth.

Just another watchdog.
But you were the first one to bark.

You deserve to die.
l almost did.

But l don't want you to think
that l'm not eternally grateful

for everything you've done.

We have to go now.

Last one. guv.

That was a real jilted-bitch thing to do.
No.

This is a jilted-bitch thing to do.

Lowell?

Picked a bad day to become a vampire.

What do you want?
Step outside.

Step into the cleansing light.

What's it gonna be. Eric?
Go for the blood. or go after Lowell?

Bollocks!

Back up. Back up.

Wash away all that is unclean.

Come closer.

Go ahead. l'll still live forever.

But will you want to?

Holy shit!

Fuck!
Luke. get it.

He has to untie the knots.

The seeds!
47. 81 2.

Oh. shit.

Count this.

7 37. 898.

99.

Oh. shit.

Oh. my God!

Shit!

What do we have here? A priest?

A priest with a secret.

Easy! We had nothing to do with this.

You have everything to do with this.

You're turning.
Leave me alone.

Your infection must have been slight
to begin with. lt can still be reversed.

How?
Sunlight. Take her into the sunlight.

Pray there is enough left of what is human
to survive the destruction of what is not.

We can do this. We're gonna do this.
The agony will be unimaginable.

No matter how strong her will. she will
fight her way back to the darkness.

You must not let her. Do you understand?
Yeah.

Good. Because l will be there if you fail.

l could use somebody like you.

Let's go.

Almost there.

Wait. wait. Stop. Luke. OK?
Just gimme a sec.

No. Elizabeth. Come on.
Look. l know you're afraid.

Come on. you can do this.
Come on. Come on.

He said the light was gonna cure you. OK?
You can do this.

Get out of here. Luke.
You can't help me.

Elizabeth. come outside with me.
Come on. you can do this. Come on.

Come on. it's not too late.
lt is too late.

lt is too late.

l know you're still here.

You can't leave until the sun sets.

Very noble. what you said to the girl
about the sunlight purging her of evil.

But she's too far gone.
and you know it.

You know she will die.

Better by her own hand than mine.

l like that.
You're more ruthless than l am.

How does it feel
to exist in both worlds.

darkness and light.

and yet belong to neither?

lf you must know...

it sucks!

May the Lord who frees you from sin
anoint you and lift you up.

What is this? Last rites?

You're giving me the last rites?

May Christ who called you. Christ whom
you betrayed. Christ who forgives you.

may Christ take you to himself.

May angels lead you to Abraham's side.
l cannot die.

l absolve you of all your sins.

in the name of the almighty Father.
his blessed Son and the Holy Spirit.

l don't want his forgiveness.

You have it nonetheless.

l deliver you now unto his judgement.

Don't you wonder. priest.

ever since you first
stared into the abyss and saw nothing?

Don't you want to know the truth
before you take my head?

Silence!
l knew him.

Knew your Christ.

Shared his agonies. Bore his secrets.

There is nothing you can tell me
that l don't already know in my heart.

l knew him better than anyone.

Better than his own weeping mother.

He loved me like a brother.

l could show you how it began
and how it will end.

No!

No! No!

No!

Lies! Lies!

Lies! Lies!

Look around. All is death.

Don't you think it's time
we put an end to it. once and for all?

l'll find you.

l'm counting on it.
