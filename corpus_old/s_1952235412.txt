I'm just trying to ask you out.

I'm not trying to negotiate
a nuclear arms treaty.

The citizens of Metropolis
have a right to ask.

Our sophomore year
was really a breakout year for us.

Breathe.

The audience really wanted to see
Lois and Clark together.

<i>I couldn't believe I was getting paid
to write Superman.</i>

For us, the second season
was a whole new beginning.

When I first did the show
I thought that...

...this is going to be a smash hit
from the beginning.

Then we started to air it,
and it wasn't a huge hit. It did okay.

But season two was the one
where we hooked everybody, I believe.

I think season one
got everybody interested.

But season two hooked everybody in.

That was our-- Our sophomore year
was really a breakout year for us...

...as opposed to a sophomore slump.

I saw your light.
Is this a bad time?

It was probably the most...

...I ever looked forward
to driving through a studio gate...

...every morning,
was the summer of 1 994.

Lois, come on.
You haven't said a word since 1 866.

You are the lowest
form of life imaginable.

We were told,
''Come up with great stories, have fun.

But open up the world
somewhat to the idea...

...that it's Lois, it's Clark,
and it's Superman. ''

And those are to be thought of
in equal parts. ''

The first season we were
just starting to build an audience.

But the advantage of having
a second season...

...is you see in the first season
what works and what doesn't...

...script-wise and relationship-wise.
That's what you focus on.

Maybe this is fate
giving us a second chance.

Nice. You rehearse that one?

Improvised on the spot.

I approached it
like studying football film.

I watched the shows and I said, ''That
works for the character, this doesn't. ''

So I would try to modify things
based on that.

It was a very natural role.
It was very fun.

<i>I modeled my Superman character
after Christopher Reeves' character...</i>

...and the way he played Superman.

So that was simple,
that was Superman.

But the Clark character was just
very well written and came naturally.

-You are Superman.
-No. Lois, Superman is what I can do.

Clark is who I am.

My idea was that Superman
is a man of action.

He comes in, whoosh, whoosh,
saves the bus, goes away.

Let him go. And then let Clark
do all the rest of the stuff.

Plus it was more comfortable to act
in a regular suit and tie and glasses...

...as opposed to in the tights
and the whole nine yards.

We started season two
with new cast members.

And we lost Michael Landes.

We brought in a whole new Jimmy
Olsen with a whole new attitude.

You guys are not gonna believe
what just happened.

Just the guy we were looking for.

They were concentrating on different
areas, and we got a very talented...

...very good actor, who's a really
good guy, Justin Whalin...

...who stepped in and played Jimmy
Olsen in season two, three and four.

Because I had just stopped doing
a series for Warner Bros...

...between hearing about it,
auditioning the first time...

...to getting the part was about three
or four days. So it happened very fast.

Coming in and doing it this way,
you have a season already in the can...

...that was fairly successful...

...and the audience already has fallen in
love with the characters on the show.

And I remember it took a while
for the fans to kind of warm up...

...to the idea of me doing the part.

Coming in and taking over a character
that's been established...

...on a show that's been established,
it's a daunting thing to do for any actor.

But Justin came in with a pedigree.
Justin had won an Emmy before.

Your report on Schott.

Got fired last year along with
his secretary. About a month ago...

...a warehouse was rented in her name.

If you ask any actor, exposition
is probably the toughest thing to do.

Because it's-- You're trying
to give information in a useful way...

...that is somehow still interesting.

Teri and Dean
are really driving the story...

...and Lane is basically
throwing orders around.

Jimmy comes in
and gives the information...

...that's necessary
to continue the story.

It's easy to memorize stuff
that's about emotional interchange.

But when you're trying to memorize
this street, that guy's name... .

I did a lot of exposition.

That was kind of my deal,
I was the exposition king.

You have the same villain every week,
at some point...

...your Superman
doesn't look too super.

We got rid of Lex,
he was dead at the end of season one.

Well, I love John Shea,
and he's a fantastic actor.

Lois.

When will you ever learn?
I always get my way.

He was suave and debonair
and a good rival.

Superman has a lot of
different villains...

...to conquer and deal with.

And we certainly came up
with a number of different, fun villains.

It was great for us to have
a different enemy in each episode.

When you're on a show and they bring in
a big name, they call it ''stunt casting. ''

I think it helped kind of having
a fun guest star each week...

...that was recognizable in other roles
who came to our show...

...and entered Metropolis
and our little town.

We had so many great actors
that came in who were recognizable.

When Raquel Welch came in to play
that role, there was no one better...

...for that role than her.

I'd like to be alone with Superman.

So it was really fun for us
to kind of create characters...

...with these people in mind, and times
it would be the other way around.

We'd create a character and we'd say,
who can we fit in this mold?

As the show got more popular,
that, as it turned out, was a lot easier.

As time went by,
you got bigger and bigger names.

People who used to not take your
calls, or say they were unavailable...

...were suddenly available.
And it was always great fun to see...

...guys like Peter Boyle on the show,
or Bruce Campbell.

I think those guys are good
and they're fun.

l was a big fan of Superman
growing up.

I think Dr. Gretchen Kelly really--
She was just a great opportunity...

...to bring in this weird, sick humor.

Playing baddies are always fun.
I mean, that's sort of a golden rule.

You get to finally do all of the stuff
that you never get to do.

The second season we tried
to heighten the production value...

...and give it a more specific look.
It had a really glossy look.

Kind of a comic-book look. And work
on things like the visual effects...

...which came a long way
between season one and season two.

Every year,
the more you did certain effects...

...you certainly develop better
techniques, and that's a lot of fun.

We went from an outside house
doing visual effects...

...to guys that we had inside
working with us...

...and took a lot more risk with the
visual effects and with special effects...

...and tried to up that quite a bit
because it just looks so great.

So we did a lot more
in the way of visual effects...

...and in the way of integrating
that into the stories.

It was really fun to see
how we'd improve year-to-year.

One of the fun dynamics
in season two was the fact that...

...Lois did not know that Clark was
Superman. And we played with that a lot.

He'd be having a conversation and then,
''I forgot to do my laundry. '' Run off.

Excuse me, I have to... .

I have a dentist's appointment.

I'm gonna call Jimmy.
I'm gonna get a hot dog.

One of the things the writers
liked to write for Clark...

...is him having to explain a way,
you know.

''Where did you go?
What were you doing?''

I'll be right back.
I forgot my mail downstairs.

I have to return this video.

It's really important.

-I have to go.
-Where?

-You guys stay here, it won't take long.
-What won't take long?

The thing that I have to do in the place
that I'll be back from in just one second.

Does he do that a lot?

Constantly.

Often Clark would be stuck in a situation
where he couldn't go become Superman.

He'd have to do something on the sly
and not get caught.

And Lois wouldn't see it.

I can't believe he ignored me like that.

Made it nice and humorous.

He'd use some super power, whether
it's super breath or his laser vision...

...or whatever it happened to be,
to sort of solve the problem.

-I'm good.
-Yes, you are.

The biggest thing that came between year
one and two was the number of letters...

...we got from people that wanted
to get the two together.

It was always something that we fought,
but the audience really wanted...

...to see Lois and Clark together.

They were trying to bring us together,
they're gonna start to get together...

...they're gonna get together, and then
someone would come in between.

What would you say
if I asked you out sometime?

Are you asking me out?

Either someone for her
or someone for my character.

It makes it a lot of fun,
playing a jealousy thing.

Hi.

We wanted to make it feel like
they were getting closer and closer...

...and then pull them apart fast.

Every episode was a dance with them.
And that's what made it so fun.

You had these two people
who were so much in love...

...and the audience is going, ''Yeah, get
them together. They should be together. ''

But if you bring them together,
all the heat's gone.

It was great, the tension
between the two characters...

...trying to get them together.
And letting them just finally date...

...and fall in love. They've been falling
in love since the moment they met...

...but they didn't even realize it.

<i>When I really felt
like Lois & Clark was really working...</i>

...was when the tension
was excruciating.

When it was like, ''Come on!

You've got to be kidding me! Kiss him!

He loves you! ''
Or, ''Tell her the truth! ''

And then to not deliver on that,
I think, accentuated the tension...

...and that's what makes
a good romantic story.

In the second season you really
hone in on what you see is working.

The characters have a voice and there's
so much to do the second season...

...because it's already been tested
and it's already kind of been proven.

<i>I think Lois & Clark
really, really, was clicking.</i>

Writing season two was just,
it was great. It was so fun.

Smoking.

It was a wonderful season. It was a
season, again, where we hit our stride...

...and found a real nice niche
in television.

And people really started tuning in.
