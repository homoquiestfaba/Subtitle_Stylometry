Make it stop.

Make it stop.

Sir, is there
anyone else in here?

Is there anyone
else in here, sir?

Let's get you outta here.

It was a accident,
a horrible accident.

And I'm sorry,

but we should consider
the event's consequences.

Wait, you said
there were no charges.

Yeah, I mean, maybe
some civil cases

from other tenants
in the building,

but nothing, nothing criminal.

The report says arson.

The report also says that
Thomas is not a suspect.

But he could have died?

Two people did die.

Your brother will need to
recover physically and mentally.

Tekiah was so beautiful.

And the baby...

There will be consequences
that will affect

his well-being once
his memory sets in.

What do you mean?

Guilt, grief and
responsibility.

Sometimes they're
deadly as cancer.

What is this?

A possible solution
for Thomas's future.

Is this safe?

Perfectly.

So you see, it's a
simple procedure.

I present to you the
first human application

of the Envision implant.

Thank you.

Any questions?

What will
control the visual images

of the subject?

Subconscious
need, desire, and emotion.

They're intertwined with the
reality of the physical world,

enhancing his experience.

It is based
on dream resourcing?

Like a waking
dream, secondary to reality.

With medicine and
ongoing counseling,

we'll be able to steer the
patient towards contentment.

His memories?

The worst are removed

with chemically-induced amnesia.

He'll create new and
less painful ones.

This is
theoretical though, right?

Thanks
to Mr. Shepherd,

theory becomes practice.

He will show the world the
true value of Envision.

Around and around we go.

Where we'll stop, nobody knows.

Come on, Iris.

Don't tell
me you're getting old

on me already, old man.

No, I just have to work.

You don't have to work.

Well, I don't
have time for this.

What if we're
stuck in here forever

and we could only look at each
other through the glass...

Okay.
But never touch.

But we're not.

Yeah, but what if we were?

I don't know.

It would be a terrible waste.

Why?

I don't have time for this.

Tell me.

Why would it be a waste?

Because I don't
like to browse.

It would be torture, a waste.

You think looking
at me for an eternity

would be torture?

I mean, yeah,
if we couldn't...

It's all in your head.
Touch isn't.

Yeah, well, you
could always touch yourself

and I could...
Look, look, look.

Masturbation lacks the
element of surprise.

Come on, I gotta go.

Okay, kiss
me, then you could go.

Iris, come on,
Iris, Iris, please.

People are watching.
Exactly.

Don't disappoint them.

All right, there, there.

Can we go?

Can we go?

Come on, come on.

If you really, really want to.

This ain't even fair.

You so cute.

This, this ain't right.

This...

Well, look, we definitely
got some bills to pay.

I, I seriously gotta go.

Look at you,
my little sellout.

Always so responsible.

Now what would I do without you?

Only you would think earning
a living is selling out.

What, this guy again?

Man, what is he doing now?

Well, it looks
like he's blocking the doorway

and talking to himself.

Oh, where you going?

To clear the doorway.

So his memories are returning?

No, but he was been
a bit strange, though.

He has conversations with
people that only he can see.

He doesn't seem happy.

Perhaps
there's a subconscious need

to connect with
his wife and child.

I mean, these last couple
years have been real,

real rough on us, Doc.

Shouldn't we be concentrating

on Thomas's well-being?

Well, that's why we're here.

We had our firm draw
up these papers for you.

We want the
procedure reversed.

It's worked perfectly.

He's living a full life.

He spends too much
time in his own world.

Yeah, he's livin' a lie.

Perhaps the truth is worse.

This is not working.

The legal order's been
served and come on, baby.

She's still in defib.

Damn it.

Come on, Iris.

Give us some help here, huh?

Nothing.

I just don't, I just don't
understand what's goin' on.

I, I'm sorry, she's gone.
No.

No, nah, this, we,
this isn't happening.

I'm sorry.

Nah, nah, she's not dead.

Sir, where are you going?

You shouldn't be
alone right now.

I just wish that
we could've met her.

Yeah, Jackie, you
would've loved her.

She was so funny.

Now how are you
really doing, anyways?

Like if you need anything,
we got you, okay?

Yeah, well, I think
I'm fine, thanks, though.

Hey, Jackie, you tell 'em yet?

Not now, Larry.
Tell me what?

If not now, then when?

What?
Not now.

Look like you'll
be an uncle, buddy.

Jesus, Larry, really?

What?
I'm sorry.

Oh, you, you're
really pregnant?

See?

I mean, my brother's going
through so much right now.

Do you really think that he
wants to hear our good news?

No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, man.

I forgot about that.
No, Larry.

No, no, it's fine.

I think it's pretty cool

and I'm really
happy for you guys.

Really?

Jackie, yes, you're
going to be a great mother.

See, I told you
he'd be happy for us.

Oh, shut up, Larry.

You can be so
insensitive sometimes.

Okay, actually, thank
y'all for the coffee.

I actually got somewhere to be.

Now, see, now
he's leaving, Larry.

See?
No, no, no, it's fine.

I really have somewhere to go.

Yeah, see, he got
somewhere to be.

You can't blame
everything on me.

Okay, but we really need

to have a conversation
later, okay?

All right, but
can you do it later?

Okay, are you really okay?

Yeah, it'll be all
good, but whatever.

I'm really happy for you guys.

I love you guys.

And I'll see you
later, all right?

Okay.
All right.

I'll see you, all right?
Okay.

All right, man.

All right, see you, Tom.

All right, Larry.
Love you.

Love you, Jack.

You are such an idiot.

You are such an idiot.

Do you know what?

You know my brother.

He's a mess right now.

When has your brother
not been a mess?

You get on my nerves.

Still ain't get no eggs.

Yup, sleeping on
the couch tonight.

No, I don't know.

Do you?

Only if you want her to.

Look, I'm don't
want to be rude...

But there's always
a way around it.

Really?

Cause it looks like
you may be wrong.

But it's not too late for you.

She doesn't have to be gone.

I don't want your
card or your advice.

But you need
them both, Thomas.

How do you know my name?

And have you had any other
hallucinations recently?

No.
Can you see

the old woman right now?
No.

Do you think I'm going
crazy, Dr. Keller?

Well, under the circumstances,

I think what you experienced

was a perfectly normal reaction

to the loss of somebody special.

You said that this
old woman said...

She said she didn't
have to be gone.

She knew my name.
Right.

Well, what that tells me is
subconsciously you're still

in the denial stage,
searching for hope

or some strand of
Iris to cling to.

Well, I mean, I miss her.

Of course you do.

But the mind is a very
powerful, very mysterious place

and you need to be careful not
to lose touch with reality.

Iris is gone, Thomas,
and I think you need

to let her be gone
in order for you

to move forward in
a healthy fashion.

Yeah, I know.

Acceptance is our goal here.

That's what I can offer.

Whenever you're ready.

Oh, damn, it's closed, shit.

Tom?

Tom Shepherd?

Whoa, Tekiah, you look great.

Thanks, you look busy.

Good morning, Thomas.

You can go right in.

How do you know my name?

Everything will be explained

to you right after the analysis.

Analysis?

Welcome, Thomas Shepherd.

Please step forward carefully.

Hello?

Who is this?

Please carefully step forward.

Thomas Shepherd,
30-year-old male.

Current account
active for two years,

three months and 14 days.

Credit approved,
searching hard drive.

What is this?

What is this place?

Current status of Iris Mone,

terminated by Thomas Jefferson.

No, no, that's not true.

That's not right.

Hey, what is this place?

Screw this.

Please remain calm.

Please remain tranquil.

It's good to see
you, Mr. Shepherd.

I came here for some answers.

Okay, Mr. Shepherd, I
think it's very important

for you to know the
terms of our agreement,

that we usually don't reach out
to clients in such a manner,

but these are extraordinary
circumstances.

Your previous agreement
is null and void.

Null and void?

What the hell is this?

This is your contract.

I've never been here before.

No?

My life has been nothing

but positive since
I went to Envision.

I was depressed and
couldn't deal with life.

And then I contacted Envision
and my whole life changed.

Everything I ever wanted
is an imagination away.

I get all the best parts of
my life every single day.

Mr. Shepherd, what we
do is provide a state

of conscious delusion.

Conscious, what?

Can you speak some English?

Okay, okay, fundamentally,
it involves you

opening your
imagination to the point

where fantasy and
reality can coexist.

You have one job in reality,

but in your mind you
have your dream job.

You can invent your
perfect life partner,

create opportunities
and your experiences.

We allow you to
customize your life,

guaranteeing success,
happiness and joy.

This is crazy.

This, this, this
isn't even possible.

Well, unfortunately,
due to legal reasons,

your experience
has come to an end.

What?

What experience are
you talking about?

Can you stop talking in code

and start clarifying
some things for me?

Okay, would you rather
be happy or aware?

Happy or aware?

What do you mean aware exactly?

Let me ask you a question.

What is it that you
think you do for a living?

I'm a writer.

I'm working on a novel.

Really?
Really.

Okay.

It's all right, Tom.

I'm not out there or in here.

I'm in here.

So what do you want to
have with the salmon?

I don't know.

What you think?

I don't know.

Well, I was going to
make a little salad.

We could do like Brussels
sprouts or asparagus

or mashed potatoes or something?

Let's do the sprouts
with some mild select.

Okay.

We about to have a good night.

Oh, let's go.

How you open this shit?

How you open it?

Excuse me, sir.

You can't smoke in here.

Oh yeah?

You can't drink that, either.

And how do I even
know if you're real?

You ever thought
about that, huh?

Thank you, whoa, whoa, fellas,
fellas, whoa, whoa, fellas.

I'm just trying to get my drink.

Y'all gonna let them
do me like this?

Hold up, fellas.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, fellas.

Come on, man, y'all gonna
let them do me like.

No, I just want my beverage.

I just want my beverage.

I just want my beverage, man.

Man, let go of me.

I just want my beverage.

Is that too much to ask?

Man, you know what?

Get off me.

Y'all gonna tear my hand.

You know what?

You two are nothing.

Without me, you
wouldn't even exist.

I just want my drink, man.

No, let go of me.

Tom, time to go, man.

Nice digs, huh?

I feel like crap.

Yeah, I know, man.

Let's go, man.

I hate seeing you
in here like this.

I think this is
where I belong.

Why would you say that?

I think I've done some
pretty messed up things

that I can't even
fully remember.

Yeah, I mean you were drunk.

You trashed the liquor store.

Not cool, but I mean it's
definitely not anything.

No, no, no.

Not last night, Larry.

Over the last few years.

Yeah, Tom, listen...

Then I get a
visit from a doctor

from the Envision
Medical Project.

What?
Having these horrible,

painful flashes of memories.

I don't even know
what's real anymore.

What was the doctor's name?

Faust, Dr. Faust.
This bitch.

But like I, what?

You know her?

She's real?

Yeah, I know her.

Let's go, man.

Let's get out of here.

What's going on, Larry?

I'm not sure,

but I'm going to
check out a few things

and we're going to figure
this out, all right?

But for now, get
yourself cleaned up.

I brought you a
shirt, man, all right?

Everybody used to smoke.

Look, I don't know
what I am, honestly.

I'm just out of,
who's this Dr. Faust?

I'm thinking she's
part of this whole

fuzzy dream reality thing
I've been experiencing lately,

with these horrible feelings
and these flashbacks

and she's talking about
she's here to help me.

I'm going to look into
it for you. I got you.

All right, man.

Like whatever, man,

but thank you, Larry.
Yeah.

I don't know,
but thank you, man.

Like thank you for
coming down here,

but don't tell
Jackie about this.

Nah, don't worry.
Her being pregnant, just...

Don't worry about that.

Are you going to be okay?

I don't know, I don't know.

I really just need to take
a walk, clear my head.

Just sort some things out.

Hey, but if you
need to talk...

All right, man,
all right, yeah.

I'm out.
Damn.

Shit, shit.

What the?

Tom?

Mr. Campbell, good morning.

Damn, what the hell
happened to you, man?

I haven't been myself lately.

Look, no worries.

I just need them free whale
edits on the desk by 5:00.

You pull that off for me?

What?

Free what?

The book, man.

The one we've been
working on for six months?

Oh, that's the
book I'm editing now.

You kid, man.

You crazy, Tom.

I had a rough time, man.

Yeah, I can see.

Damn, you smell like
a frat house, brother.

I know, I know, I'm sorry.

Well, man, I've
been letting a lot

of this weird behavior slide
'cause you do good work.

I do?

I do.
Yeah.

I mean when you show up.

Look, man, pull
yourself together

for appearances, all right?

I will, I will, I am.

Look, man, we all
have our issues.

Appearances, all right?

Appearances, Tom.
Appearances.

And Molly's so pretty
with her freckles today.

Oh, and we had toast with jam
and we played hide and seek.

Heat.

Y'all real?

Can you feel it?

Can you feel the heat?

How was court?

It was fine.

It was fine.

What are you doing?

Dr. Faust contacted Thomas.

The fuck?

She did?

That's what he said.

We did serve her that order?

Well, yeah, I mean,
which means it's not right,

but it's not illegal.

Weird.
Yeah, it is weird.

Yes, but not illegal?

Yeah, why was all this stuff

in Thomas's office
upstairs in the attic?

This is strange.

I don't know.

You think that he was working
on this before the fires?

Apparently so.

What are you thinking?

I don't know yet.

Julie, Julie Newl?

Yes.
Someone will

be with you shortly.
Thank you.

Good luck, Tekiah.
Thank you.

Oh, don't worry.

I'm not your
competition or anything.

I'm not here for anything.

Oh, that's such a relief.

Tell me about it.

I'm in no shape
for an interview.

Sorry, I had to wait long
enough so they wouldn't think

we were together.
Okay, thanks.

What can I get you?

Oh, I'll have
a coffee, please.

Sir?

What she said, coffee.

All right, then.

So, how you doing?

You look really, really great.

I mean, your kid looks
great, but you...

Thanks, he's my world.
Yeah, wow.

I've been drinking
mostly, a lot.

Pretty much all the time.

Tom, you're
not homeless, are you?

I honestly, I mean,
I really don't know.

I haven't checked.

I had a small little
campfire in my bathroom

a couple nights ago, but...

Oh my God, Tom.

It's okay, it was okay.

Who was she?

She was, she was...

She was everything I imagined.

Like she was the one, if you
believe in that sort of thing.

She was so funny.

We even talked about
having kids and...

Wow, I am such a
lunatic, you know that?

Why is that?

It's, we couldn't, we
couldn't even have kids.

I mean, that's a
long story, whatever.

Can I ask you a question?

Of course you can.

Okay, if you could choose
between being truly happy

and being aware, what
would you choose?

What do you mean, Tom?

What do you mean being aware?

Okay, like what if you could,

what if you could trick yourself

into believing something like...

Never mind, this is
a stupid question.

Never mind.
No, no.

How you been?
No, it's not stupid.

Ask me.
Yeah.

Well, all right.

What if you could
be truly happy,

but in order to do so
you would have to live

in some sort of dream
reality la-la land?

This is so silly.

It's not silly.

I would choose to be aware.

You'd rather be
miserable in reality

for the rest of your life

rather than being
happy in la-la land?

I'm a mom now.

I have Carter.

I have to be conscious.

I can't live in a dream land.

Besides, reality is
what you make it.

You don't have to be miserable.

Right, I mean, I
guess that makes sense.

You're talking about
the drinking, right?

Sure, the drinking, yeah.

You know they have
programs for that?

Tom, I know you don't want
to hear this and it's hard,

but you can't drink this away.

Sooner or later, you're
going to have to deal with it

and you're not going to
be miserable forever.

Trust me, I promise.

What happened
between us, Tekiah?

Time, life, you know.

No, what happened between us?

You, me, why didn't we work?

And I honestly can't
remember why we broke up.

I don't know.

There you go, sir.

Can I get you anything else?

Sir?

Listen, Why don't
we get out of here?

We'll go to the park and then
you can come by the house

and wait with me for Carter.

I don't, Tekiah, it's...

It's a bit too soon for me.

Boy, stop, all I
was talking about

was getting some warm
food in your belly.

Oh, right, right, right.

I'm so sorry.

That sounds great, I'm sorry.

Okay, let's not make
this any more awkward

than it already is.

You got your PJs on, babe?

Yes, Mommy.

All right.

Bedtime in 10 minutes.
Yes, Mommy.

You can't drink in here
around my kid, Tom.

This is what I came here for.

I'm a mess, but
I'm not a scumbag.

I'm sorry, it's just
that promised after Tyler,

that I would never have a drunk
in here around Carter again.

Look, listen, I don't
have to stay here.

I can go home.

No, no, you need
a friend right now.

And I want Carter to
meet my old friend, Tom,

after I clean you up a bit.

What?

You don't like the beard?
No.

Gee, I was going
for the war gate look.

It's not working.

Nah, nah, but look,
all jokes aside.

Are you comfortable
with me staying here?

It's kind of random.

Random is what we do.

If it's not broke,
don't try to fix it.

Thanks, you are a dear friend.

Goodnight, Mister.

What we watching, big guy?

"Tom and Jerry."

Oh, those guys
are my favorite.

Really?

Yeah.
Mine, too.

Good morning.
Hey, good morning.

"Tom and Jerry" is on.

I put some shaving cream
in the bathroom for you

and there's a bag of
clothes by the closet.

Stuff I've been
meaning to get rid of,

but help yourself to
whatever you like.

Yeah, okay, appreciate it.

Wait a minute.

Both of us just come
out of heavy situations

and I don't want either of
us to get the wrong idea.

You know what I mean?

Yeah, thanks for...
You can't live here.

I'm sorry, it came out harsh.

I didn't mean it like that.

No, it's okay.

I was planning on going
home today anyway.

I feel like such an idiot.

Nah, you're not an idiot.

You're just a good mother.

You don't have to leave today.

You could...
Nah, I gotta go back home

and check on some
of these damages.

Besides I was thinking
about what you said earlier

and I think you're right.

About what?

I want to try being
aware for a while.

What's this?

Just feels good to be
right about something.

It's amazing, we have
so many little people

crammed into this tiny,
little spot on the planet,

trying to connect with
everything except each other.

What's wrong with us, Doc?

People are scared.

Scared of what?

We're all just people.

Scared of not getting
what they desire,

what they desperately seek.

Love, self-fulfillment, meaning.

And what's this?

This is somehow supposed
to fix everyone's problems?

No, it's not for everyone,

but I simply wanted
to provide an option

when there wasn't one.

An alternative to a life of
grief or despair, sadness.

I mean, I have been
having a rough time.

So we're going to
extend your contract.

No, I'm done and I'm
done drinking, too.

Now I see why you've
been having a rough time.

Huh?

Drinking is one thing.

The dextromethorphan that's...

Dextro what?

DXM, it's a hallucinogenic.

It makes the Envision process
vivid and unpredictable.

I think you should
take a few days and...

Nah.
Yup, yeah.

Just take a few days without
the drinking and the DXM

and let me know
what you think then.

You are the Doc.
Absolutely.

Take these and it will
subdue the effects

and give you a glimpse
into the real world.

I just want you to
make the right decision

in the right frame of mind.

I'll see you in a
couple of days, Doc.

Hey Jack, check this
out, listen, listen.

Can you please put
some clothes on, please?

My brother is going
to be here any minute.

It's your brother.

It's not the Dalai Lama.

Just listen.
Come on, Larry.

Larry, I can smell your
sour ass from over here.

Like that's nasty.
I took a shower last night

and you best just listen.
It's a new day.

What up, what
up, what up, y'all?

Hey.
She's late for a nice game?

You smell sour ass?

No.
Shit.

Really, Larry?

Really, really?

Look, this pregnancy done

gave your sister
a bloodhound nose.

Yup, I can smell...
Can you smell the future?

Yup, and it smells
like sour ass.

You're right, yup, sure can.

Anyway, how's work going?

Work is horrible.

I have a really horrible job.

Horrible?

I thought you loved your job.

So did I, but I don't.

I'm actually looking
for something new today.

Okay, but just know that
we still need to have a talk.

Sure, but what about though?

We need to wait, legal stuff.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
is this serious?

What legal stuff?

Well, sorta, yeah.

Like we just need to sort
out a couple of things

and then we go from there.

Just wait a couple
of days, all right?

So Tom, check this out.

You appreciate this.

So you know how
they got, nowadays,

they got these different things

for lonely people to
meet up with each other?

They got speed dating.

They got online dating.

Real loser stuff, date nights.

All that bullshit?

Larry, you're starting
to worry me, man.

Like this is the second
time you said we needed

to talk about what's
really going on,

but you're not really
saying nothing.

So what's this about?

This about the arrest?

The doctor?

It's not about the arrest.

I, well, we will talk.

Just trust me.

Just trust me, Tom.

Give me a little bit more time.

You know me a lot of years,

so you know I got
you, all right?

So Tom, check this out.

Listen to this.

"Living in the city
breathes the people that are

"in dire need of
human connection.

"For all those souls who yearn

"for a little human interaction,
we have the solution."

All right, what I'm
about to say next

is probably ridiculous.

Most ridiculous thing you
ever heard, all right?

This new thing is called...

Y'all ready?

It's called cuddle parties.

What the hell
is a cuddle party?

A cuddle party.

What is that?

Well, apparently is a
party where you cuddle.

They cuddle at the party.

You made it up.
I kid you not.

Check it out.

Whatever, Larry.
Cuddle party shit.

What'd I tell you?

See the thing.

I want everyone here to know

that this is a very
safe environment, okay?

Everyone here is here for
the same basic reasons,

so we need to feel like
we can trust each other

before we start our journey.

That's why you guys are
going to hold hands.

Now some ground rules.

This is not about sex people,

so no touching each
other's delicates please.

Accidents are accidents
and that's fine,

but let's just be respectful
so we can all share

in a powerful experience.

Now, let's start by stating
some personal boundaries.

I just don't want
any dry humping, okay?

I just don't want a massage
from someone's crotch.

Okay, I think that falls

under the "no sexual
behavior" category.

Okay, but last week
this really lonely guy

was dry humping me and it made
me a little uncomfortable.

Okay, I understand
that, thank you.

And don't rub my ass

for more than five
seconds at a time.

I don't like that either.

Okay then, anyone else?

What, what are you
doing back there?

Massaging you.
What?

It feels like I'm
being examined.

Thomas, why don't you
try to put more emotions

in your fingertips?

Let's truly connect here.

Let the love pour from you

until we're just laying in
a big pool of love together.

Yeah, yeah, that sounds nice.

I'll try.

Yeah, that's it.

What, wait, why'd you stop?

I'm sorry, this
is too weird for me.

I can't, I can't do this.

Thomas, don't you want to
truly connect with someone?

Don't you want to be loved?

Yeah, we can love you.

We can all love you together.

Oh, no, no, no,
ma'am, no, no, no, no.

Not like this.

This, this isn't real.

This, this, I can't, I can't.

You're just a bunch of
waitresses smiling at me

while you take my order.

Sir, can I help you?

I was here to
see some friends.

This is not a safe place.

You should move along.

Okay, what's going on?

A fire in the scene, come on.

Was anyone hurt?

A woman and her child died.

Oh my God.

Sir, sir, it was a
couple of years ago.

I was just here.
Relax.

I hate this neighborhood.

Sir, are you okay?

This is it.

I'm so sorry, Tom.

We never thought you
would do this to yourself.

Just relax and rest.

I promise we won't let this
happen again, I promise.

You can't help her, Thomas.

This is the past.

You can't help him, either.

What's done is done.

Hey sweetie, how was your day?

Great, I finished.

That's great.

This could be my big break.

That's the
Envision company story, right?

Yes, yes, and
you won't believe

what this company was doing
to get the FDA to sign off.

Did you think of a title?

Yeah, I think I'm going
to go with "Imprisoned."

What?

I thought it was funny.

Are you getting sick?

Just a little cold,
baby, that's all.

You need
to take some medicine.

There's some cough syrup
in the cabinet, all right?

And I'm going to
go check on Carter

and then we'll celebrate.

Cool, cool, cool.

Where those fancy glasses?

Sir, is there
anyone else in here?

Make it stoop.

Sir, sir, is
there anyone else in here?

Make it stop.

Sir, is there
anyone else in here?

Let's get you out of here.

Tom, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

Doctor, thank you so much
for taking care of him.

It's my pleasure,
Mrs. Sullivan.

No, you were right.

We should have trusted you.

I'm so sorry.

You did what you
thought was best,

so no apology needed, seriously.

He's waking up.

You.
No, Tom, Tom, relax.

She's trying to help.

She's trying to help.

It's okay.
No, no, I remember, no.

Tom, she's trying to help.

No, no, no, I remember.

Time to take your crazy pills.

Funny, Iris.
Fine, more for me.

We get out today.
Can't wait.

How's the head?
Focused.

So Doc, how's our guy doing?

Thomas seems to be coping
and as far as Dr. Faust goes,

she no longer has
direct contact with him.

What happened?

Thomas has strong negative
feelings towards the doctor

and he blames her
for his situation.

There were a few incidents,

but he's calm now.

He's talking to Iris,

His dead girlfriend?

She is not dead.

She was never alive.

She was an illusion.

Well, are you sure that
Thomas is going to be all right

when he leaves?

The delusions manifest
themselves physically,

a result of the implant,

but psychologically he
is in perfect health,

except for an unknown
amount of memory loss.

He has an imaginary friend?

He's not on any medication.

He is not diagnosed
with a disorder.

We couldn't keep him here
even if we wanted to.

Okay, so will he hurt
himself again or anyone else?

Mrs. Sullivan, he is perfectly
safe to himself and others.

His attempt to hurt himself

was just him processing
this new reality.

Now that he's come to
terms with it, he's fine.

Even Dr. Faust?

Just keep that bitch away
from my brother, Dr. Keller.

That's something
we're going to have

to manage together,
Mrs. Sullivan.

All right, Doc.

We'll be by to pick him
up tomorrow afternoon.

Released already?

We don't even know
what he remembers.

No, I'll handle it, no police.

Hey, Larry, man, he
looks just like you.

Yeah, I was kind of
hoping he would get my brains

and Jackie's looks, but...

Larry.
Driving here.

Tom, are you all
right, like really?

I'm fine, I have some time
to think about some things

and sort 'em out.

And?

I'll be fine, Jackie.

You're gonna have
to stay with us for a while.

Why?

Because I can take
care of myself.

We know you can, but you need

to be someplace
that's really safe.

I mean, we got plenty of room.

Well, I don't want to be a
burden on you two or anything.

Nah, we got
plenty of room, Tom.

You got evicted while
you were in there.

Yeah, all your things are
at, we have all your stuff.

All right, well, thanks, guys.

Oh, your friend can come to.

Larry.
What?

Is she back there?

How about you keep your
eyes on the road, Dad.

Got you, got you.
I'm sorry, Tom, I'm sorry.

It's cool, it's cool.

I'm meeting up with her later.

Seriously?
Yeah.

Maybe we should bring
back a rose for old Agnes.

It's like her life didn't
mean anything to me.

Well, not entirely
meaningless.

What do you mean?

You really are crazy,

aren't you?
Certifiable.

Don't you remember?

You've seen Agnes before.

What do you mean?

You really are crazy,

aren't you?
Certifiable.

Don't you remember?

You've seen Agnes before.

I can't remember her.

It's like a blank space.

And you're not making
this no easier.

Thomas, I can only show
you what you want to see.

Thomas, what are
you doing here?

Honestly, Doc, I came here
to break in your office,

but I'm glad you're here.

And I see you've done
most of my work for me.

Thomas, leave it alone.

Tell me about Agnes.

It was the implant.

What?

No, you have no idea

who you're getting
involved with, Thomas.

Okay, Dr. Keller,
Brenda, I need your help.

Do you have any idea of
what it's like to not know

if your life is real or
some imaginary world made up

by your subconscious?

To love someone with
every fiber of your being,

only to find out they
don't even exist?

Everything I believed
in, everything I loved,

everything that makes
me who I am is gone

or never existed.

Do you even care how
that makes me feel?

How many lives have been ruined?

How many people have
you and Faust killed?

Do you think I
wanted this to happen?

Do you think I meant
for Agnes to die?

She was my sister.

What?

She was my sister.

I only wanted to help her.

Agnes was the only
survivor of a car accident

with her husband and her child.

I just wanted to create
a better life for her.

If it were the implant
that killed her, Doctor,

why am I still alive?

You're supposed to be dead.

You should be dead.

I want to die.

I want the pain to go away.

You took everything away
from me, even peace.

I tried to get her to stop.

I was too afraid
to go to the police

and she wanted me to keep silent

and she used it against me.

How much longer do I
have to live, Doctor?

We don't even know
why you're still here.

Nothing has changed
since Agnes's death.

You could expire at any time.

There were no warning
signs with my sister.

All right, okay, Dr. Keller.

Well, before I expire,
understand one thing.

You and Faust will pay
for what you've done.

Iris, what are you doing here?

I came to help, Tom.

There's no use, Iris.

I don't have much time left.

I know, it's the implant.

You knew this whole
time and didn't tell me?

I'm so sorry, Tom.

Remember, I can only show
you what you want to see.

Well, Faust is going to pay.

There are other crimes

and we'll see it wait to
the local new station.

I got to find that envelope.

What do you remember
about the last time

you had it?
Practically nothing.

Hey, that's too much.

You can't take that much.

Relax, baby, it's just
a little cough syrup.

It's not gonna kill me.

Look, check this
out, look, look.

Daytime, non-drowsy, I'm okay.

Right, did you
find the glasses?

Yeah, yeah, I did
find the glasses.

Oh, so you moved them?
Just pour.

We were drinking and I...

The cough syrup.

I didn't wake up.

They died because of me.

Hey, you didn't do this, okay?

Come on.

Iris, I'm dying.

But you're not,
so stop acting like it.

Iris, hurry up,
wake up, wake up.

Could you get off me, please?

You okay?

Pull yourself together, Tom.

Imaginary, ring a bell?

Come on, let's go
find that envelope.

I'm so sorry, Thomas.

The good Dr. Keller
managed to come to grips

with her own kill.

It was gonna go to mid-40s.

It was quite the breakthrough.

You're late.
I can't believe

you let this chick
get the jump on you.

A little help, please?

She's a little old
woman, that's embarrassing.

I see the implant
is still working.

I thought things could work out.

Not good, Tom.

You killed her?

Oh, did our dear doctor
tell you about your wife, too?

My wife?

Yeah, she was actually an
unfortunate, unnecessary,

unintended, I mean, like
unintended, seriously,

ended up a casualty of war.

Casualty of war, I suppose.

Oh, did you mean someone else?

Agnes Blythe?

Oh, on the contrary.

Mrs. Blythe was a child
in psychiatric medicine,

a product of
scientific development.

And you, sir, are the
evolution of that science.

Don't move.

It's because of you
that we were able

to move forward with Envision.

It is because of you that
I figured out the cause

for Mrs. Blythe's untimely death
and it also because of you.

You get the credit.

That she's kind of like a
modern day scientific hero.

The human trials you
were so bent on stopping

through your little
research articles

were made possible
because of you.

And that cough syrup you
unwittingly started drinking...

You see, it contained a missing
chemical to our equation.

You see, dextromethorphan,

that's contained
in the cough syrup.

You see, it stopped
the Envision implant

from overloading your synapses.

The overload of synapses is
what caused Mrs. Blythe's death.

Her neurotransmitters
stopped functioning

and all of her natural
functions ceased to a bullet.

You surviving the first fire
was a convenient mistake.

That won't happen again.

I said get out.

Okay, okay, breathe, breathe.

You trying to burn
down the house, ma'am?

I'll show you a fire.

That's really not necessary.

That's really not necessary.

Not exactly.
Get out.

Thomas, don't leave
me, don't leave me.

I got a article to rewrite.
No, no.

It's okay, it's okay.

I won't play with fire.

So Larry, y'all gonna
give the little guy name

or what's up?

Well...
I was thinking

about naming him Little Larry.

Oh, hell no, nope, nope.

We gonna name him after
someone who's really special.

Hey.
Nope, I mean,

we were really thinking

about naming him
after someone special.

Who?

No, no, no, not me.

No, no, no, but we were
thinking of naming him Carter.

Carter?
Yeah.

Only if you cool
with it, though.

What you think, big guy?

Looks like a Carter to me.

I say we let her win, Carter.

Wait a minute, wait,
wait, wait, you're leaving?

Yeah, I've
got some work to do.

Wait a minute, you're leaving?

Yeah, I've got
some work to do.

Yeah, you got fired the
same day you got evicted.

Larry.
It's all good.

Lar, I appreciate
the support and all,

but this research is,

works on me, so perhaps
I'm not unemployed.

I like to say I'm freelancing.

All right.
All right.

Well, where are you going?
