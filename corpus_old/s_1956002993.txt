(SIREN WAILING)

BOY: (WHISPERS) <i>Shh. Listen.</i>

<i>This all happened a while back
in the town I'm from.</i>

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

<i>I can't swear
to every last detail,</i>

<i>but I can swear
to most of them.</i>

(POLICE SIRENS WAILING)

<i>So I don't care
what the newspapers said,</i>

<i>or what your parents told you.</i>

<i>Before the storm came in</i>

<i>and blew the whole world
to the ground,</i>

<i>this is what really happened.</i>

(ENGINE REVS)

(TIRES SCREECH)

(FOLK ROCK MUSIC PLAYING
ON STEREO)

I'm going down
to see your father.

You gonna come?

(FOLK ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES)

Daniel, If I wanted
to talk to something

that didn't talk back,
I'd get a cat.

(LOWERS VOLUME)

You think this is easy
for me, huh?

You think I'm just...

It's not, okay?
It sucks. It does.

But it... It just kills me

to see you pissing
the whole summer away

just doing nothing
with yourself.

I'm meditating.

I'm leaving in 10 minutes.

I'd like it
if you came with me.


BOY: <i>Daniel Middleton's father</i>

<i>was just the kind of guy
they don't make anymore.</i>

<i>He lit his cigarettes
with a match.</i>

<i>Like a cowboy in an old movie.</i>

<i>And he changed the oil
in his car all by himself.</i>

<i>He fought in Vietnam,
for Christ's sake.</i>

<i>He went to church.
He loved his wife.</i>

<i>People liked him.</i>

<i>But when he died,
Daniel was so fucked up</i>

<i>he quit his paper route
without giving notice.</i>

<i>And after a week,</i>

<i>Mrs. Schrader
would phone the police</i>

<i>to report
that the Puerto Rican kids</i>

<i>had been stealing
her newspapers.</i>

<i>He burned the records</i>

<i>his father bought him
for his birthday.</i>

<i>Elvis, fucking Johnny Cash,</i>

<i>Frank Sinatra.</i>

<i>He thought
it would help him move on.</i>

<i>He told his mom
it was an accident,</i>

<i>but the school psychologist</i>

<i>told her
it was something else.</i>

This is what we call
a cry for help.

You're spending the summer
with your Auntie Barb.

DANIEL: <i>Fuck.</i>

Watch it, that's family.

And mind your mouth,
you're in a goddamn cemetery.

Do I get any say in this?

Daniel, if I wanted your
opinion, I would've asked.

Sending me away
for the summer.

What a clichÃ©.

You know what I did
the summer after high school?

You mean before you
started drinking at breakfast?

You know...

I hope by this age

you have a little bit
of your father in you.

Just a little.

(POP ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

BOY:
<i>When Daniel Middleton arrived,</i>

<i>the town wasn't too different
than any other.</i>

<i>It was hot in the summer
and cold in the winter.</i>

<i>And when it was Christmas,</i>

<i>you were just six months
away from the 4th of July.</i>

<i>And on the Fourth of July,</i>

<i>you were just six months
away from Christmas again.</i>

<i>People love Jesus
and macaroni salad.</i>

<i>And they hung American flags</i>

<i>above front doors
that they never locked.</i>

<i>Everyone had two kids,</i>

<i>and mowed their lawns
on Saturday mornings.</i>

<i>Some of the old people
even still had a milkman.</i>

<i>A lot of things
happened that year.</i>

<i>America went to war,</i>

<i>Freddie Mercury died of AIDS,</i>

<i>and I turned 13 years old.</i>

<i>And, in Hyannis,
Massachusetts,</i>

<i>it was the hottest summer
in 68 years.</i>

(POP ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES)

<i>There was the parade
on Saturday,</i>

<i>and then on Sunday,
the summer birds would show up</i>

<i>and change the whole town.</i>

It's delightful.

BOY: <i>They came
from Connecticut and New York,</i>

<i>and had white cars</i>

<i>and white clothes
and white teeth.</i>

<i>And their kids
always had names like...</i>

Tanner.
Kendall.

BOY: <i>There were two types
of people in this town.</i>

<i>There were the summer birds,
like these guppies.</i>

<i>And then there were
the townies.</i>

Save your shit, we're late.

(AUNT BARB COUGHING)

BOY: <i>Look, see,</i>

<i>Daniel Middleton
wasn't either.</i>

<i>He wasn't a townie because
he didn't grow up here.</i>

<i>And he wasn't a summer bird</i>

<i>because his family
wasn't rich.</i>

<i>We din't have a name
for people like that.</i>

<i>But whatever it was,
you didn't want to be it.</i>

<i>Something changed inside
Daniel Middleton that summer.</i>

<i>I never did figure out
what exactly caused it.</i>

<i>Wonder if he ever did.</i>

(HIP-HOP MUSIC BLASTING
ON STEREO)

GIRL: You a summer bird?

What? Yeah. What?

Are you a summer bird?
No.

Are you from here?

Yeah. Wait...

Are you from here?
What? What?

Are you from here?
No, no.

Okay.
Okay.

(BLUES MUSIC CONTINUES)

BOY: <i>It was 96 degrees</i>

<i>the first time he saw that
cold-blooded motherfucker,</i>

<i>Hunter Strawberry.</i>

<i>And Hunter Strawberry
wasn't sweating.</i>

<i>Oh, I forgot to mention,</i>

<i>these summer birds
absolutely love to get high.</i>

<i>I mean, these fuckers
smoked tons of weed, man.</i>

<i>Every chance they could.
Even the adults.</i>

<i>And they had to get it
from someone.</i>

<i>They'd come in
for a new muffler</i>

<i>and leave with a bag
of the best shit</i>

<i>south of Route 6.</i>

<i>Plus, they felt less guilty
buying their drugs here</i>

<i>than off
some little Portuguese kid</i>

<i>down at the harbor.</i>

<i>I mean, if you
were on the Cape</i>

<i>during the late '80s
and early '90s,</i>

<i>you knew who he was.</i>

The boy's a criminal.

Waste of talent.

Wicked fucking hot.

Bad.
Cool.

BOY: <i>Everyone knew
the stories.</i>

<i>You'd hear them in a
locker room or at a barbeque.</i>

<i>Or at a sleepover
or something.</i>

<i>Like the one where they said
he was kicked out of school</i>

<i>'cause he boned
Principal Finney's wife</i>

<i>in the butt without a condom,</i>

<i>and never called her back.</i>

<i>But how many
of these stories were true?</i>

<i>No one really knows.</i>

I heard he drove a motorcycle
180 miles per hour

at night, in a thunder storm,
without a helmet.

I heard his cock
was 10-inches long.

Eleven, idiot.

I heard he burned down
an ice-cream shop

for putting sprinkles
on his cone.

Hunter Strawberry
does not like sprinkles.

BOY: <i>But there was
that one thing</i>

<i>everyone could agree on.</i>

I heard he killed a man.

BOTH: I heard he killed a man.

I heard he killed a man.

Fuckin' killed him.

BOY: <i>But at the end
of the night,</i>

<i>everyone had gone home,</i>

<i>we're still just a townie.</i>

<i>And he knew that's all
they'd ever see in us.</i>

<i>He sold weed
to this guy yesterday.</i>

<i>And banged his daughter
the night before.</i>

<i>But, you see,
that's the thing.</i>

<i>In public, they all look
the other way.</i>

<i>Nobody was proud
that they knew him.</i>

RADIO ANNOUNCER:
<i>Mainly clear skies today.</i>

<i>It hit 90 in Boston.
Tenth time that's happened</i>

<i>so far this summer season.</i>

<i>And it's still toasty
in the late afternoon hours...</i>

HUNTER: What happened to Adam?

What's your name again?
Uh, Daniel.

Dan. Well, my mom...

I'm gonna call you Danny.

Danny. Okay.
Yeah.

Danny? Why Danny?

'Cause it's cool.

Take that. (SNIFFS)

Yeah, yeah.

WOMAN: Honestly, fuck you.

Yeah. Fuck you!

BOY: <i>She was the biggest fox
in 50 miles.</i>

<i>Most kids I know
would've chopped off a nut</i>

<i>just to touch her hair.</i>

<i>Phil Lambert once stole
a pair of her underwear</i>

<i>from the girls' locker room.</i>

<i>And he has the picture
to prove it.</i>

<i>I mean, like,
every boy in town</i>

<i>used to jerk it to her.</i>

<i>I know I did.</i>

<i>Still do.</i>

<i>Before he and his prom date</i>

<i>were killed by a drunk driver
on the Mass Pike,</i>

<i>Ricky Worrel
swore on his mother</i>

<i>he saw her naked once.</i>

<i>He said if you rode your bike
past her house</i>

<i>at just the right time,</i>

<i>you could steal a look
in her bedroom window.</i>

<i>He promised everyone she had
a mole on her left tit</i>

<i>which, if true,
would be the closest thing</i>

<i>to an imperfection
ever documented about her.</i>

<i>Too bad he was alone,
no one could back him up.</i>

<i>That Bazooka Joe</i>

<i>would be the closest
he ever came to kissing her.</i>

<i>He kept that piece of gum
until the day he died.</i>

<i>Others had better luck.</i>

<i>Freshman year in high school,</i>

<i>she was dating a senior,
Kirby Wells.</i>

<i>He was the first kid in town
to get a tattoo.</i>

<i>But when he drowned
that summer in Louis Bay,</i>

<i>she didn't bat an eye.</i>

<i>Or so the story goes.</i>

<i>But Kirby Wells
wasn't her only ex</i>

<i>that wound up dead.</i>

<i>By junior year,
she was dating a linebacker</i>

<i>on the Boston College
football team.</i>

<i>And he would drive up
from Chestnut Hill</i>

<i>every weekend just to see her.</i>

I play football.
BOY: <i>But when she dumped him,</i>

<i>he was so heartbroken
that he quit the team.</i>

<i>And then,</i>

<i>when he heard
she had a new boyfriend,</i>

<i>the poor bastard hung himself
by the neck.</i>

(CAR DOOR SHUTS)

It smells
like fucking shit in here.

Can you take me home?

(GIRL SIGHS)


Come on, gorgeous.

Enough with the hysterics,
all right?

You're embarrassing yourself.

Suck a fucking dick, asshole.

Who's the river rat, huh?

Or you could just stay here.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(LIGHTER CLICKING)

Want one?

What?

Oh, no. No, thanks.

I have asthma.

That blows.

He looked like a real...

He looked like a real asshole.

And how would you know that?

He was eating Raisinets.

Food of...

Food of assholes.

(RADIO SWITCHES ON)
(CLASSIC R&B MUSIC PLAYING)

(GIRL LAUGHING)

What?
What are you laughing about?

(CLASSIC R&B MUSIC CONTINUES)

Wanna hear a joke?
(SWITCHES RADIO OFF)

Sure.

You're not going to laugh
'cause it's not funny.

Okay.

Okay.

So, this

man walks into a man
with his pet... (STAMMERS)

(CLICKS TONGUE) This, um...

Just gonna start again.

This man walks into a bar
with his pet giraffe.

And the giraffe just
goes to sleep on the floor.

And there's a bartender
in the bar,

and he says, "Hey, hey,
what's that lyin' there?

"Can..." You know...

And the guy says,

"That's not a lion,

"that's a giraffe!"

(CLICKS TONGUE)
That's my joke.

You're dumb.

What's your name?

Uh, Daniel. But people

call me Danny.

Why Danny?

'Cause...

It's cool.

I don't really think
it's cool,

so I'm just
gonna call you Daniel.

Cool?
Cool.

Very cool.


Hey, what... What's your name?



(PATTING POCKETS)

Fuck.



(CLASSIC R&B MUSIC RESUMES)

You know,
I drove her home last night

in my car.

And, uh...

I just, I can't get her
out of my mind.

Her nails were, like,

painted black

but she chewed 'em down
real low and, uh...

This look she gave me, man...

This fucking look...

I don't even know her name.

What would you say
if I told you

I wanted
to start selling weed?

No, don't tell me this is
about fucking pussy.

No, no.

Nah.
It's about pussy.

No, no, no.
(COUGHING)

Wow, I'm, like, really high.

I'm, like, really high.

HUNTER:
Where's this chick live?

What?

Where does this girl live?
She...

Oh, just, like,
over near the airport.

Oh, fuck.

DANIEL: "Oh, fuck" what?
Uh-oh...

Did you bang her? (LAUGHS)

She's got, like, a penis
or something? (GIGGLES)

She's my sister,
you little shit.

Well, is it cool if I...

Just leave her alone.

Okay.
"Okay"?

No. No "okay." I'm serious.
Yeah, no, dude.

I'm serious.
Yeah, yeah.

Leave her the fuck alone.
All right. Okay, okay.

Yeah.

Don't tell her
I said anything.

She doesn't talk to me
anymore.

Why... Why not?

She's gonna get outta here.

She's gonna go on
and live a good life.

Yeah.

Okay, all right.

All right, forget her,
you know.

I still want
a piece of your action.

Why?
Look, look,

cops are all over you, dude.

Nobody know...
Nobody knows me.

You're serious?
Yeah, I'm...

(SNICKERING)
I'm serious.

Why not?

Exactly.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Yeah.

DANIEL: <i>So what's
the standard pricing?</i>

A gram goes for 10 bucks.

We call that a dime bag.

That's what
we smoked at the party.

Exactly. Good,
you're a fast learner.

What's this one?

That's 3.5 grams.
We call it an eighth.

It's 30 or 40, depending
on how good the bud is.

Most people
wanna buy those things.

What about this bad boy?

That's a zip. It's an ounce.

So it's 200 bucks,
give or take.

If more people bought these,

my life would be
a lot fucking easier.

Well, we should sell
more of those.

Yes, we should sell
more of these.

But you can't make people
buy what they don't want.

And how can we
make them want it?


You're a smart little fuck,
you know that?

You're too smart
for your own fucking good.


All right?


BOY: <i>And so it began.</i>

<i>Over the next month,</i>

<i>they sold all up and down that
town and five towns over.</i>

<i>And if you were like me,</i>

<i>which means
you were getting stoned</i>

<i>in lower Cape Cod that summer,</i>

<i>you were getting it
from Hunter Strawberry</i>

<i>and Daniel Middleton.</i>

OFFICER: You're new
out this way.

Yes, sir.
That wasn't a question, pal.


And when the air's so heavy
you can't breathe,

the nights turn long
and sleepless

and the stars feel like
they're burning out above you.

The whole world

feels like it's

folding in.

When you long
for cooler times,

do you know what it is

that's gonna tear you apart?

No, sir.

You will soon.

See you further down the road,
Mr. Middleton.

HUNTER: <i>Yeah,
that sounds like Calhoun.</i>

DANIEL: <i>Who?</i>

Calhoun. That's his thing,

just putting the fear of God
into anyone

that'll fucking let him.
Okay, yeah.

He scared the shit out of me.

He's been on my back
for fuck knows how long

and I'm still here.

Hey, I don't know about you,

I don't wanna end up
in Walpole

getting fucking butt-raped
by a skinhead in the showers.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
take it easy, bro!

No. I had a half pound of weed
in the back of my car

when he pulls me over.
That's insane.

Keep your fucking voice down.
Hey, I'm serious.

Right now, the risk
versus reward is all fucked.

Yo, what do you want?

Can I get you, uh, a beer?

You want an ice cream,
some sprinkles on it?

No, you don't get
what I'm saying.

If you're starting
to fucking shake already,

Then maybe this isn't the
fucking thing for you.

We have a choice,
we have to choose.

You're fucking confusing me.

You want to be the guy that's
putting gas in those cars

or you want to be the guy
that owns the gas company?

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

That's good.
Yeah.

DANIEL: So what do
we have now,

25, maybe 30 customers?

Altogether about
a pound a week, right?

HUNTER:
That's good fucking money.

DANIEL: That's great money.

Look, the problem is

we're dealing dime bags
to teenagers.

All right? We need customers
who buy in bulk.

A month ago, you didn't know

how to use a fucking bong.
Right?

And now you're trying
to tell me how to flip weed?

Have I disappointed you yet?

Look, the problem
isn't with the demand.

It's with the supply,
all right?

By the time it gets to us,

it's already been through
a load of hands, like,

everybody's taking their cut.

We would need to find someone
who can move heavyweight.

All that shit comes
through Portland, anyway.

Oregon?
No, Maine.

But that's besides the point.

One of those
big-time motherfuckers

is not gonna want to deal
with two fucking kids.

(MUFFLED MUSIC PLAYING)

DANIEL: We'll see.


Look, are you gonna tell me

what the fuck
we're doing here?

Or... Like, who
are you looking for?

That big-time motherfucker.


All right.
No, no, hold back.

My cousin said this guy will
talk to me only if I'm alone.

It's cool. Don't worry.

I'm not worried.
Yeah. You're not worried.

You're cool,
you're not worried.

(MIMICS SCHWARZENEGGER)
I'll be back.

Hey.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, little man.

You can't just be sneaking up
on people.

Sneakin', sneakin'
like a little snake, huh?

Sorry.

I heard you had...
I heard you had weed.

Yeah, there's pussy

I heard you sold weed.

Come here.

Who are you?
Uh, I'm Taylor, Daniel's...

Taylor's cousin Daniel.

You a narc?
Uh, what?

A narc.
A narc?

Taylor didn't tell you
I was coming?

No, Taylor didn't tell me

You're not a narc, huh?
No.

Taylor didn't tell you

I was coming?
(IMITATES MOCKINGLY)

You cool?
Yeah, I'm cool.

Cool. Okay.


Huh? Wanna party?
All right.

want to buy some weed.

I heard you had weed.
Like, a lot.

Like, as much as you can get.
Oh, really?

Pounds, you know?

Pounds?
Mmm-hmm.

Tons?

Well... (GRUNTS SOFTLY)

I'm a little high,
so let me get this, uh...

You come to my place...

I don't know who you are,
little snaky.

You don't know who I am.

And you ask me
to sell you pounds of drugs?

Let me tell you something.

I look like a jungle monkey

<i>Earlier that day, Gary Pinkus,

<i>It was also the same day</i>

What, uh...
What happened here?

Oh, just a fight.
I don't know.

Naughty.
Yeah.

I'm guessing
I should see the other guy.

Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

Why?

It's an expression.

So how long have you
been following me for?

Following...
What, following you?

I haven't been following you.

Can you smell my sunscreen?


(SOFTLY) Good.
Thanks.

I'm looking for Epsom salt.

Get in.

I'm not into any of...
DEX: I'm not asking.

(CASH REGISTER DINGS)

(SING-SONG)
I've been watching you.

Longer than you'd be
comfortable with knowing.

You've got reach,
I've seen that.

You're, uh, smart, careful.

But not careful enough.

That kid whose head
you split open,

he shits into a bag now,
but he's alive.

You're lucky. However,

you caught my attention.

Which means before long,

you'll catch the wrong kind
of attention.

Look, I don't know how close
you've been watching, bro,

but I've been around the block
a few times

so I know
that the cops out here

ain't worth spit in a bucket.

I'm not talking about cops,

bro.

You know what your problem is?

Got a feeling
you're about to tell me.

You're selling dime bags
to tourists.

You're sitting
at the penny slots

trying to take down the house.

Yeah, well, it's doing
just fine for me so far.

All right. I'll tell you what.

If all you're looking
to do is, uh...

Is scratch together
enough cash

to buy the Traci Lords'
videocassettes,

I'll settle this tab
right here.

We part ways. No love lost.

Something tells me
you're looking to do more

than blow
your itty bitty loads

into your tube socks.

Amen to that.

Amen to that.

All the running around,
all the, uh,

transactions...

Keep it up.

It'll end one of two ways.

Either you'll be in Walpole

getting raped by a skinhead
in the showers

or...
That is exactly what I said.

Which, I can assure you,
is not pleasant.

Or the homeboys
from Jamaica Plains

are gonna come out here
and take all your...

You've made
your fucking point.

Ooh.

Oh! Thank you, ma'am. Hello.

Yes, yes, yes.

Your job

is to find people who are
looking to buy in bulk.

HUNTER: And what's your job?

Hmm?

What's your fucking job?
Ah.

The man I work for who,

sure as the sky is blue,
you will never meet,

will provide you with as much
product as you can handle.

My job is to make sure
you pay us back on time.

What does your boyfriend do?

My boyfriend here, he drives.

He also occasionally
hurts people,

but that's another story.


this isn't some sort of,
like, sting operation?

How do we know
you're not cops?

That's a good question.
A very good question.

Cops can't do that. Sit down.

Okay.

Um... Sit down?

(DEX HUMS)

What happens from here on

is something
of a trial period.

We front you some weight,

you have till Thursday,

and not a second more,

to flip it
and pay us back the principal.

Whatever you make over that,
that's yours to keep.

That's two days.
Mmm-hmm.

That's a shit fucking deal,
man.

How much are we talkin' about?

Two pounds. Good shit.

Better than anything
around here.

It'll sell like, um...

Like cold cherry ice
on a hot summer night.

How about five pounds?

Think you can handle five?

That shouldn't be a problem.

But what if something happens?

What if we... What if
we're late? What then?

You've seen the movies.

Five pounds? Are you out
of your fucking mind?

Now we're caught up
with those cocksuckers.

They're exactly
what you said we needed.

Five pounds.

That was fucking dumb.
I have a plan.

What?
What is your fucking plan?

Trust me.

What if it doesn't work?
It has to.

Now give me
one of them cigarettes.

Yeah.

Don't lie to me.
Don't play me for a fool.

Yeah.

You were at the fireworks

I hear some summer bird

This is very romantic but what
the fuck are we doing here?

You know, you remind me of...

There was a boy
a few years back.

Kyle Tate, right? Yeah,
I know all of the stories.

I look like someone
who wants to spend

the next 20 years
rotting away up in Walpole?

I'm not gonna go out
like that.

Not like that.

You ever thought about
just giving it up?

Yeah, sure. And do... Do what?

Go to college.
Get a job, maybe.

I don't think that
meatloaf dinners

and a white picket fence

are in the cards for me.

Well, how do you imagine
this is gonna end?

Look, if you were
gonna get me,

you woulda got me already.

McKAYLA:

I used to catch them
in those glass jars.

It always reminded me
of how planes looked

when they're

Why'd you stop?

Kept dying.

Got depressing.

I think you should

start collecting
the fireflies again.

You can't hold on
to everything.

I think some things you can.

Then I hope you're good
at being hurt.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

All right. So what?

So, last time I checked,
it wasn't illegal

for your old man
to be a fucking fuck-up.

It's a little hard
to tell now,

but half a lifetime ago,

your dad was the coolest thing
in 100 miles.

Yeah.

Kind of guy who could
break a girl's heart

just walking into a room.

Jimmy Strawberry.

Yeah, see, we was
thick as thieves, me and him.


We, uh...

Got into some trouble.


They were good times.

You know, part of me
likes to believe

that it was him who saved me.

That he knew who he was.

And he knew
where his life was headed.

And he didn't want
that life for me.

The choices that we make

ain't always about us.

DANIEL: <i>I've never
really said this before...</i>

Uh...

But I think I might...

Whatever it is
that you want to say...

Wait.

And if you still wanna tell me
when summer's over...

Tell me then.

(CLASSIC R&B MUSIC PLAYING)

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

DANIEL: Hunter?
You hear what I said?

There's this guy
up in Portland,

he's got good stuff.
Good prices.

He wants to meet us.

What does... What does
Dex think about this?

Dex doesn't know.

What?

Dex doesn't know,
but, you know,

I can imagine
that it's gonna be fine.

All right. All right, am I
missing something here?

We got the best weed hookup
in the whole of the northeast.

And you want to
fuck it up, for what?

This guy...

He's not selling weed.

HUNTER: Oh...

So you think you're
a cocaine dealer now.

This is gonna be more money

than either of us
have ever seen.

Is that... Is that really
what this is all about?

What else would it be about?

You don't think
any of this shit through.

You don't, man, do you?
Cocaine.

All I'm saying is
how long are you

gonna be Dex's errand boy?

We're not the only guys
he sells to,

why in the fuck should he be
the only guy we buy from?

'Cause that's just how
this shit works, Danny.

That's how it's always worked.

I don't have to
explain that shit...

Okay. If we never upended
how things worked,

we'd be on that corner right
there selling nickle bags

and dime bags to summer birds
and teenagers.

If Dex finds out, and he
will find out, look at me.

Don't...

...come running to me.

That stuff that
people say about you.

Any of that true?

(McKAYLA SIGHS)

HUNTER: Hey, who was that?

Stop, wait. Will you...
Will you just talk to me?

McKayla, please.

I'm sorry about Mom, okay?

I know that I hurt her.

I don't expect you
to forgive me.

I don't expect it. I'm...

I'm just...
I'm trying to be good.

I'm trying
really fucking hard.

All right? I need...

I can't do this on my own.
Stop selling drugs.

You know,
it's not that simple...

How else am I supposed to...
How? Okay. All right.
