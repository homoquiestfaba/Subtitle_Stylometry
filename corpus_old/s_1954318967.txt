<i>Every town has its legends.</i>

<i>Every neighborhood</i>
<i>has its boogeymen...</i>

<i>A killer with a hook</i>
<i>for a hand...</i>

<i>A drifter</i>
<i>who snatches children...</i>

<i>The witch who lives</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

<i>Ours growing up in</i>
<i>staten island was cropsey,</i>

<i>about an escaped mental patient</i>
<i>who lived in these buildings</i>

<i>who would snatch children</i>
<i>off the street.</i>

<i>This urban legend turned real</i>

<i>when five neighborhood children</i>
<i>went missing.</i>

<i>It was these disappearances</i>
<i>that led us to examine</i>

<i>the real crimes behind</i>
<i>the cropsey urban legend.</i>

<i>A grisly discovery</i>

<i>of an arm and a leg</i>
<i>sticking out</i>
<i>from a shallow grave.</i>

<i> And what we</i>
<i>discovered was a connection</i>

<i>to an institution</i>
<i>with a shocking history.</i>

<i>This is what it looked like,</i>

<i>but how can I tell you</i>
<i>about the way it smelled.</i>

<i>It smelled of filth,</i>
<i>it smelled of disease,</i>

<i>and it smelled of death.</i>

<i> Understanding</i>
<i>the real story behind cropsey</i>

<i>inspired us to investigate</i>
<i>other urban legends</i>

<i>and the true crimes</i>
<i>that may have influenced them,</i>

<i>and what we uncovered</i>

<i>was a truth more horrific</i>
<i>than any fiction.</i>

This is where
we thought that cropsey lived,

in these buildings here.

It's very easy
for an urban legend

to come out of
something like this.

Yeah, and we didn't
think anything of it

until kids started going missing
on staten island,

and then we were like,
cropsey is real.

But do you think
every urban legend

has truth behind it?

Yes, I think you have to have
some form of like truth

to gonna go off of.

There's a lot of
other urban legends

in a lot of other communities

that have some form of truth
behind them.

Uh-hm.

And what's interesting
is all these communities

have all these places.

<i>Well, every kid is lured to</i>

<i>or fascinated by the old house</i>
<i>at the end of the block.</i>

These are the stories
that fuel your nightmares,

and these are the places
that fuel your nightmares.

<i>So why are you here tonight?</i>

You hear stories.

We just want to see
what it's about, I guess.

<i> What do you guys</i>
<i>expect to find out here?</i>

People who died here
are supposed to be the ghosts.

<i> You believe</i>
<i>that there are devil worshipers</i>

<i>in the woods here?</i>
Oh yeah, I do, I do.

Somebody said they were doing
freaky experiments

and crap like that.

<i> Why do we believe</i>
<i>these urban legends?</i>

<i>Maybe we need to believe</i>

<i>because the reality is too much</i>
<i>for some of us to bear.</i>

<i>An old legend that actually</i>
<i>happened this time...</i>

<i>- Many more cases</i>
<i>of contaminated treats...</i>

<i>I know she suffered, a lot.</i>

<i>He pulled a knife</i>

<i>and tied me up</i>
<i>with electrical tape.</i>

Oh, God.

<i> And so instead,</i>
<i>we created our own monsters.</i>

<i> The</i>
<i>36-year-old building contractor</i>

<i>who reportedly dressed</i>
<i>like a clown...</i>

<i>At least three young boys</i>

<i>buried under his house.</i>

<i>And maybe that's because</i>

the truth is more terrifying
than we could ever imagine.

<i>- I got seven down</i>
<i>and.</i>

<i>Seven down!</i>

<i>I've got a child victim...</i>
<i>I need rescue.</i>

<i> For Rachel and me,</i>
<i>this is an attempt</i>

<i>to uncover the source</i>
<i>of our nightmares</i>

<i>as we pull back the curtains</i>
<i>on what it is we all fear...</i>

<i>because urban legends,</i>
<i>as scary as they may be,</i>

<i>are really just warnings for</i>
<i>something much more dangerous...</i>

<i>the reality that may have</i>
<i>started it all.</i>

<i>The hook is one of the oldest</i>

<i>and also one of the scariest</i>
<i>urban legends.</i>

<i>A teenage couple</i>
<i>are making out in their car</i>

<i>while parked at a lover's Lane.</i>

<i>As the two are</i>
<i>about to go all the way,</i>

<i>the radio interrupts them.</i>

...Are killed by an LA gunman...

<i> A crazed maniac</i>
<i>with a hook for a hand</i>

<i>has escaped</i>
<i>from the local insane asylum.</i>

<i>The frightened girl</i>
<i>demands to go home</i>

<i>as the frustrated boy</i>
<i>guns the engine.</i>

<i>Later, as the boyfriend</i>
<i>goes to open his date's door,</i>

<i>he sees dangling</i>
<i>from the door handle,</i>

<i>the maniac's bloody hook,</i>
<i>ripped from the socket.</i>

The hook urban legend

probably came to be
in the mid-1950s.

<i>One of the interesting</i>
<i>appearances of the hook</i>

<i>was in November 1960</i>

<i>when it actually appeared</i>
<i>in the dear Abby column,</i>

<i>and it's something that a</i>
<i>lot of people would have read.</i>

<i> But dear Abby</i>
<i>wasn't warning teenagers</i>

<i>about escaped madmen</i>
<i>with hooks for hands.</i>

<i>Urban legends</i>
<i>are more mysterious than that</i>

<i>and never quite so literal.</i>

<i>Despite its name,</i>
<i>the hook is a cautionary tale</i>

<i>warning teenagers everywhere</i>
<i>about the dangers of sex.</i>

<i> The hook</i>
<i>urban legend captured something</i>

in the era that people
were interested in.

<i>It captured a certain amount</i>
<i>of danger being involved</i>

<i>in teenage sexual behavior</i>
<i>and in teenage car culture.</i>

<i> For the teenagers</i>
<i>in texarkana, Texas,</i>

<i>this wasn't just</i>
<i>some cautionary tale.</i>

<i>In the early spring of 1946,</i>

<i>a masked man</i>
<i>known as the phantom</i>

<i>attacked four couples,</i>

<i>most of whom were parked</i>
<i>on lover's lanes.</i>

<i>The attacks, which killed five,</i>

<i>were said to coincide with</i>
<i>the full moon,</i>

<i>hence the nickname</i>
<i>the moonlight murders.</i>

<i>And although there were</i>
<i>numerous suspects,</i>

<i>the phantom was never caught,</i>

<i>allowing his enduring legacy</i>
<i>to haunt this town</i>

<i>for more than six decades.</i>

So this is South robeson
and this old highway 67.

The murder site
is somewhere around here,

but that's what we've got to
kind of figure out.

<i> It was a rainy</i>
<i>Sunday morning on march 24</i>

<i>when a passing motorist noticed</i>
<i>Richard Griffin's oldsmobile</i>

<i>parked on a lover's Lane</i>
<i>off highway 67.</i>

<i>Inside he found Griffin, age 29,</i>

<i>and Polly Ann Moore, 17,</i>
<i>lying in the backseat.</i>

<i>Both had been shot</i>
<i>in the back of the head.</i>

<i> Hey, guys,</i>
<i>how are you doing?</i>

<i>What we're doing is</i>

<i>we're investigating</i>
<i>the phantom killer.</i>

They had a lot of speculations
on who did it,

but it was never...

no one was ever
brought to justice.

Did you hear stories growing up?

All I ever heard was
don't go to spring lake park.

Really?
Uh-hm.

Why?
It's kind of
creepy out there,

so we were always afraid
to go there.

<i>But did you still go?</i>

No.

<i>We're having a little trouble</i>

<i>finding out where the area is</i>
<i>because everything's changed.</i>

Well, I can take you
out there to the road

and point to almost the spot.

Right about there.

Uh-huh.

<i>On that side?</i>

On that side.

<i> Like the couple</i>
<i>in the urban legend,</i>

<i>Griffin and Moore</i>
<i>had been attacked</i>

<i>while parked on lover's Lane,</i>

<i>highlighting the warning</i>
<i>behind this campfire tale,</i>

<i>but what the residents</i>
<i>in texarkana didn't know...</i>

<i>because it wasn't reported</i>
<i>in the papers...</i>

<i>were the horrific details</i>
<i>behind this real-life crime.</i>

They had found evidence
of blood and a blanket...

Uh-hm.

And they believe
that she was raped

out in front of the car

and then put back in the car.

<i>The first double murder</i>

<i>didn't cause</i>
<i>a lot of excitement.</i>

All kinds of crimes
were going on in texarkana,

but they didn't recognize
until sometime later

that this is a different
kind of crime.

The term "serial killer"
wasn't in vogue then...

And no one recognized
this as a serial killing.

<i>The main suspect</i>
<i>was youell swinney</i>

who was an ex-convict.

<i> Youell swinney</i>
<i>and his newlywed bride,</i>

<i>a former prostitute named Peggy,</i>

<i>had been arrested</i>
<i>for stealing cars.</i>

<i>Under questioning,</i>
<i>the wife confessed</i>

<i>that her husband</i>
<i>was the phantom,</i>

<i>but refused to sign a statement.</i>

<i>Although the case</i>
<i>quickly fell apart,</i>

<i>the judge still sent swinney</i>
<i>away for life</i>

<i>as a habitual car thief.</i>

No evidence directly
correlating...

<i>No physical evidence.</i>

They had his wife's statement,

but they could not use that
without her permission.

There had been a lot of
other suspects, hundreds.

People had theories

and all kinds of rumors
had been bouncing around,

but it's normal in any event,
especially when there's mystery

as there was always mystery
in this one.

<i>Texarkana is nothing</i>
<i>like other towns.</i>

It seems to be wallowing
in the notoriety.

Documentary team in town

to shoot a part
of texarkana history.

This week,
some texarkana residents

will have the chance
to appear onscreen

<i>in a documentary film</i>
<i>of the phantom killer.</i>

So what should we make
of all this?

The conclusion is simple...

texarkana will never
escape its past.

We should give up trying.

<i> It was a half moon</i>
<i>on February 22</i>

<i>when Jimmy Hollis, age 24,</i>

<i>and Mary Jeanne larey, 19,</i>

<i>were attacked</i>
<i>on a secluded</i>
<i>lover's Lane.</i>

<i>Both survived after a car</i>
<i>scared the assailant away.</i>

<i>Around midnight,</i>

<i>Mary Jeanne larey</i>
<i>and Jimmy Hollis</i>

<i>were making out</i>
<i>in the front seat of their car.</i>

All of a sudden,
a guy appears with a gun,

wearing a mask over his head,
white,

two holes cut out
for eyes and mouth.

He tells her to run.

He chases her down
and then starts to attack her,

basically sexually assaults her
with the barrel of his gun.

She said she'd much rather
have been killed like the others

than to have been left
the way she was.

<i> While the attacks</i>
<i>on lover's lanes in texarkana</i>

<i>didn't specifically</i>
<i>involve a hook,</i>

<i>the phantom's sickening crimes</i>

<i>created an equally horrifying</i>
<i>metaphor.</i>

<i> One of the victims</i>
<i>was actually sexually assaulted</i>

<i>with the barrel of a gun,</i>

and so we have the idea
of a foreign metal object

being used in this way
which seems to be

psychologically
behind the idea of the hook.

<i>In the hook story,</i>
<i>we have the hook</i>

<i>about to penetrate the car</i>
<i>when the boy drives away</i>

<i>and the hook is then ripped</i>
<i>from the hand of the murderer.</i>

<i>So we have the idea</i>
<i>of penetration</i>

with a foreign metal object
as already part of that story,

and that in fact happened
in the texarkana cases.

<i> But the sexual assault</i>
<i>was only part</i>

<i>of the phantom's</i>
<i>trademark signature.</i>

These two people
are the only ones

who ever saw the phantom.

Both... wearing masks.

<i> Right, they both said</i>
<i>the guy was wearing a mask.</i>

So this is the whole thing,

where the whole white
mask thing came from.

<i>The phantom's disguise</i>
<i>was another chilling detail</i>

<i>as it also helped to popularize</i>

<i>the most widely known</i>
<i>retelling of the murders</i>

<i>in the 1976 cult classic,</i>
"the town that dreaded sundown."

<i>The movie was thought to be</i>
<i>one of the first slasher films,</i>

<i>having predated Halloween</i>
<i>by two years,</i>

<i>and its take on the phantom</i>

<i>would influence generations</i>
<i>of cinematic boogeymen.</i>

<i>The director,</i>
<i>Charles b. Pierce,</i>

<i>blurred the lines</i>
<i>between fact and fiction</i>

<i>by telling the film</i>
<i>in full documentary style.</i>

<i>It was Sunday, march 3, 1946...</i>

<i>the beginning of</i>
<i>a reign of terror</i>

<i>for the people of texarkana,</i>
<i>a terror so indelibly imprinted</i>

<i>that today, people</i>
<i>still speak of it fearfully...</i>

<i>only the names</i>
<i>have been changed.</i>

<i> Now I think</i>
<i>everybody in texarkana</i>

<i>knows about the story</i>
<i>of the phantom killer,</i>

<i>but there's a lot of</i>
<i>intermingling</i>

<i>of facts and legend</i>
<i>between the movie</i>

<i>and the actual</i>
<i>phantom killer case.</i>

<i>This is Casey Roberts,</i>

<i>media manager</i>
<i>at Texas a&m, texarkana.</i>

<i>He's done extensive research</i>
<i>on the crimes</i>

<i>and brought us</i>
<i>to one of the locations where</i>

"the town that dreaded sundown"
<i>was filmed.</i>

A lot the... kind of landmarks

from both the original case
of the phantom killer

and the movie
<i>the town that dreaded sundown</i>

have gone away over the years,

and this particular house here

<i>was used in one of</i>
<i>the big scenes.</i>

<i>It was Friday, may 3,</i>

<i>when Virgil and Katie starks</i>
<i>were attacked in</i>
<i>their farmhouse</i>

<i>just outside of town.</i>

<i>Virgil was shot</i>
<i>and killed in his armchair...</i>

<i>While Katie, shot in the face,</i>

<i>ran out of the house.</i>

<i>Everybody seems convinced</i>
<i>that youell swinney is the guy,</i>

but you're saying...

Youell swinney would have
been easy to pin it on,

<i>and they needed to</i>
<i>pin it on somebody.</i>

The one person that...

I haven't been satisfied
he was cleared...

<i>was a young man</i>
<i>that committed suicide</i>

<i>and left a note saying</i>
<i>that he was the phantom killer.</i>

<i>It's just part of the legend...</i>
<i>the son of a prominent family,</i>

and it had the connections to,
you know,

cover up his dirty deed.

<i> Hoping to dig up</i>
<i>more information,</i>

<i>we went searching</i>
<i>through the microfiche</i>

<i>of the texarkana gazette.</i>

<i>Promising lead proves dud.</i>

So this is the mention
of that, youell swinney.

The officer had been
trying to validate

the story of a woman.

<i>The woman's statement</i>
<i>followed so closely</i>

<i>to the known facts of the case</i>

<i>that they are almost positive</i>
<i>that she was telling the truth,</i>

and at one point,
they were almost to the point

of announcing a break
in the case.

Subsequently, however,
the woman said

<i>that neither she nor her husband</i>

had anything to do
with the slayings.

<i>It's interesting.</i>

So they don't call him
the phantom at all in this,

but we just saw, literally,

the advertisement
in the newspaper

for the movie that is showing,
<i>the phantom speaks.</i>

This is the movie
that they theoretically

pulled the name from,

<i>and right here at the newspaper,</i>

<i>one of the guys said,</i>

'well, why don't we call him
something...'

we need to call him something,
let's call him the phantom.

<i>We had just witnessed</i>
<i>an important step</i>

<i>in the creation</i>
<i>of any urban legend...</i>

<i>the naming of the boogeyman.</i>

<i> One of the roles</i>
<i>that urban legends play...</i>

<i>and this is</i>
<i>an ancient function...</i>

is that they will put
a name on something

that gives people
fears or anxieties.

<i>That gives the person</i>
<i>some feeling of control.</i>

So give the murderer a name...
he's the phantom murderer.

<i> The mask,</i>
<i>the movie, the phantom.</i>

<i>These were the crucial elements</i>
<i>that would help create</i>

<i>texarkana's very own</i>
<i>urban legend...</i>

<i>a legend that would only</i>
<i>continue to grow</i>

<i>with screenings of</i>
"the town that dreaded sundown"

<i>held every year in</i>
<i>texarkana's spring lake park.</i>

All of this area was part
of spring lake park...

At the time and this is where...

a couple of the places
where the murders happened.

<i>That was where lover's Lane was.</i>

You basically
set up the screening

that you have of
<i>the town that dreaded sundown</i>

at spring lake park.

Yes, we do it every October,
and because of the history,

we like the idea of having this
out at spring lake park

since that's where some of
the murders take place at.

We started getting
some phone calls saying

that they didn't think
it was right,

that there were
still families in town...

That, you know,
that were affected by this.

<i>The police concern was</i>

that it was going to
cause somebody else

to have the idea
to start doing it again.

A film crew was in town
last month...

And there's a new movie
being made?

What we've heard is
that it was actually a remake

of<i> 'the town</i>
<i>that dreaded sundowns</i> .'

it's you know, just probably
a more modern version of it.

I've heard that the storyline
of the movie

is about a copycat
that comes out

from the screenings
that happened at spring lake.

Are you serious?

That's the first
I've heard about that.

Well, you know,
imitation of life, I guess.

<i> While it may seem</i>
<i>shocking to some,</i>

<i>the screenings</i>
<i>at spring lake park</i>

<i>were especially appropriate</i>
<i>because it was here on April 14</i>

<i>where the phantom</i>
<i>turned larger than life.</i>

Four hundred yards

from the entrance
to spring lake park...

where the sign is...

they found
Paul Martin's car empty.

<i>In yet another attack,</i>

<i>not only had the phantom</i>
<i>murdered two teenagers</i>

<i>in the center of town,</i>

<i>but their deaths</i>
<i>would incite a panic</i>

<i>that would grip texarkana</i>
<i>and never let go.</i>

<i>Betty Jo booker, age 15,</i>

<i>was a saxophonist</i>
<i>for a high school band</i>

<i>called the rhythmaires</i>

<i>that played weekend shows</i>
<i>at the local vfw.</i>

<i>At 1:30 A.M.</i>
<i>that Saturday night,</i>

<i>she left with a</i>
<i>childhood friend</i>
<i>named Paul Martin, age 16,</i>

<i>who was supposed to drop</i>
<i>her off at a slumber party.</i>

<i> Paul's body was found</i>
<i>lying on its left side.</i>

<i>Blood was found further down</i>

<i>on the other side of the road</i>
<i>by a fence.</i>

Right over here,
Paul Martin's body was found.

<i>He had been shot twice,</i>

and then he crawled
across the street, over to here,

and then whoever did it
shot him again twice.

They said he put up a struggle.

He had a bullet
through his hand...

Right.

Raised his hand,

probably begged
not to be killed, and then...

<i>They found him</i>
<i>at 6:30 in the morning.</i>

<i>Betty Jo booker</i>
<i>was nowhere around.</i>

<i>Although supposedly</i>

<i>only the names had been changed</i>

in<i> the town</i>
<i>that dreaded sundown,</i>

<i>one of the most egregious</i>
<i>fictionalizations</i>

<i>had Betty Jo booker</i>
<i>playing the trombone</i>

<i>instead of the saxophone,</i>

<i>the reason being to show</i>
<i>a more terrifying demise.</i>

<i>The scene was so memorable,</i>

<i>some people in town actually</i>
<i>think that's how she died.</i>

<i>The actual site</i>

<i>of where Betty Jo booker's</i>
<i>body was found,</i>

<i>along the edge</i>
<i>of a forgotten road,</i>

<i>had eluded many.</i>

<i>Lost in time</i>
<i>when a section of the park</i>

<i>was turned into housing,</i>

<i>this was one mystery</i>
<i>we were determined to solve.</i>

<i>She was found two Miles away</i>

<i>from Martin's body.</i>

<i>The road's closed.</i>

<i>Here's where we think</i>
<i>this road continues on.</i>

<i>See that line</i>
<i>between those two trees?</i>

Totally.

<i>That's the road</i>
<i>that's been overgrown.</i>

Keep that flashlight down.

Just turn it down.

Look at that.

<i>This looked exactly like</i>
<i>the older road.</i>

<i>It is the old road basically</i>

<i>that we just went through</i>
<i>somebody's backyard to get to.</i>

<i>What is it?</i>

<i>It's a big spider web...</i>

<i>It's halfway between</i>
<i>the two ends.</i>

<i>This is Betty Jo booker,</i>
<i>15 years old.</i>

<i> Shot twice,</i>
<i>once to the left rib</i>

<i>and once in the face,</i>
<i>to the left cheek.</i>

<i> Well, she's fully</i>
<i>clothed...</i>

<i>Fully clothed, yeah.</i>

<i> Her overcoat</i>
<i>has been buttoned up,</i>

<i>and her hand</i>
<i>was put in her pocket.</i>

<i>Strange.</i>

<i>See that picture for a second?</i>

<i>Doesn't it look like it?</i>

It must.

<i> Like if you're</i>
<i>looking at it like that,</i>

<i>add 60 years.</i>

<i> It could be.</i>

<i>I feel bad, though.</i>

You know, we're never going to
really know who killed her.

<i> What happened to</i>
<i>Paul Martin and Betty Jo booker</i>

<i>out on these roads</i>
<i>over 60 years ago</i>

<i>was horrific enough.</i>

<i>Their deaths</i>
<i>didn't need to be rewritten</i>

<i>for more blood or Gore.</i>

<i>Coming out here, you realize</i>
<i>that real life is just as scary</i>

<i>as any horror film...</i>
<i>and sometimes even more.</i>

<i>This is Marc bledsoe,</i>
<i>a former probation officer</i>

<i>who was obsessed with the case</i>

<i>and conducted his own</i>
<i>investigation.</i>

I developed a passion,
I guess in the '90s.

I saw the film, of course,
when I was a seventh grader,

and I was pretty scared

because of the way
the film ends.

It shows the boots

and said he could still
be walking the town.

<i>I wanted to know</i>
<i>what the truth was.</i>

<i> Bledsoe was one of</i>
<i>the only people</i>

<i>to interview youell swinney</i>
<i>in recent years.</i>

<i>Swinney, who was out of jail</i>

<i>and living in</i>
<i>a Texas nursing home,</i>

<i>had suffered a stroke</i>
<i>the year before,</i>

<i>making his speech</i>
<i>difficult to decipher.</i>

Fifty... sixty years?

<i>But she said you and her</i>
<i>were together</i>

<i>at spring lake park.</i>

Hear that?

They drove out there together
at spring lake.
What did he say?

<i>No, I wasn't.</i>

<i> Who do you think</i>
<i>was the main...</i>

I don't know.

<i>You wish they'd catch him.</i>

<i>Hm, interesting.</i>

<i>Hi. I just wanted</i>
<i>to check one thing.</i>

<i>They told me</i>
<i>you all were videotaping?</i>

<i>Have you all signed the thing?</i>

<i>Ugh!</i>

I feel like
there was more there.

<i>Despite being so close,</i>

<i>we still didn't have</i>
<i>an answer as to who</i>

<i>the phantom really was...</i>
<i>and we probably never will.</i>

<i> What happened</i>
<i>to the phantom killer</i>

<i>no one really knows.</i>

<i>Some believe he was convicted</i>
<i>of another crime,</i>

<i>and today he is still serving</i>
<i>his term in a Kansas prison.</i>

<i>It's these lack of answers</i>

<i>that allows a legend to endure</i>

<i>for the teenagers in texarkana.</i>

<i>So, what do you think</i>
<i>the next chapter is</i>

<i>in that legend?</i>

Probably more ghost stories,

maybe more kids
trying to scare other kids.

Do you think it will ever end?

I think eventually
it will fade out,

but I wouldn't be able to say
for how long.

I mean, legends
last for a long time.

<i>So this is the tree where,</i>

<i>because of the movies,</i>
<i>some people think</i>

<i>Betty Jo booker was actually</i>
<i>killed with the trombone.</i>

<i>I think why this is so</i>
<i>kind of important</i>

<i>is because so many people</i>
<i>believed the fiction,</i>

<i>and the fiction became reality,</i>

<i>and in this town...</i>

I really think
what's interesting is...

they can't separate the two.

Well, I think it's more
romantic, though,

to believe in the myth

than to have the facts
in front of you.

<i> You have the</i>
<i>whole town coming out</i>

<i>and watching a fictionalized</i>
<i>version of that,</i>

<i>and that's just like little kids</i>

<i>telling a fictionalized version</i>
<i>of what really happened.</i>

<i>That's what an urban legend is.</i>

<i>Where does the truth end</i>
<i>and the fiction begin?</i>

<i>At this point,</i>
<i>no one quite knows.</i>

<i> Texarkana today still</i>
<i>looks pretty much the same,</i>

<i>and if you should ask people</i>
<i>here on the streets</i>

<i>what they believe happened</i>
<i>to the phantom killer,</i>

<i>most would say</i>
<i>that he is still living here</i>

<i>and is walking free.</i>

So right now,
we're driving into Houston.

We're going to investigate
the urban legend

of the candy man.

<i>The name candy man</i>

<i>has a lot of</i>
<i>urban legend references.</i>

<i>Obviously, one of the most</i>
<i>well-known is the film Candyman</i>

<i>based on the clive barker</i>
<i>short story</i>

<i>about an urban legend expert</i>
<i>investigating the boogeyman</i>

<i>who haunts the cabrini-green</i>
<i>housing projects in Chicago.</i>

<i>With my hook for a hand,</i>

<i>I'll split you from your groin</i>
<i>to your gullet.</i>

<i> Here the Candyman</i>
<i>uses a hook,</i>

<i>just like the well-known</i>
<i>hook urban legend</i>

<i>where it was probably</i>
<i>appropriated from,</i>

<i>but the film's villain</i>
<i>wasn't the first candy man.</i>

<i>The original was, in fact,</i>

<i>a very real monster behind</i>
<i>one of the most horrific crimes</i>

<i>anyone could ever imagine.</i>

<i> We've all heard the</i>
<i>same story about Halloween.</i>

<i>Little Johnny had been warned</i>
<i>never to go trick-or-treating</i>

<i>at any house he didn't know,</i>
<i>but he didn't listen.</i>

<i>Instead, he convinces</i>
<i>his friends</i>

<i>to go get candy</i>
<i>from this one weird house.</i>

<i>Later that night,</i>

<i>as they're all digging</i>
<i>through their loot,</i>

<i>there's this scream.</i>

<i>All the kids</i>
<i>are rushed to the hospital,</i>

<i>but it's too late.</i>

<i>Johnny's dead from eating</i>
<i>candy laced with poison,</i>

<i>and all the other kids</i>
<i>had their mouths ripped open</i>

<i>from swallowing</i>
<i>razor blades and glass.</i>

<i>They never did catch</i>
<i>the person who did it.</i>

<i>Turns out, Halloween</i>
<i>really comes from</i>

<i>the ancient custom of druids</i>
<i>collecting kids for sacrifices,</i>

<i>and apparently these murders</i>
<i>were committed by those</i>

<i>who still carry on</i>
<i>that evil tradition.</i>

<i> So does our modern-day</i>
<i>custom of trick-or-treating</i>

<i>really stem from evil druids</i>
<i>and child sacrifices?</i>

<i>It's highly unlikely,</i>
<i>but there's no denying</i>

<i>that something very sinister</i>
<i>is out there</i>

<i>instilling panic and inciting</i>
<i>fear every Halloween.</i>

<i>There's one magical,</i>

<i>haunted evening each year</i>
<i>when all the scary creatures</i>

<i>come out to prowl through</i>
<i>every neighborhood.</i>

<i>Most people enjoy having</i>
<i>trick-or-treaters</i>

<i>come to their doors,</i>

<i>but there are a few people who</i>
<i>will do things to hurt kids.</i>

<i> The first documented</i>
<i>case of tainted candy</i>

<i>happened on long island in 1964</i>

<i>when a housewife</i>
<i>named Helen pfeil,</i>

<i>upset with older kids</i>
<i>for trick-or-treating,</i>

<i>handed out dog biscuits,</i>
<i>steel wool,</i>

<i>and poison ant buttons.</i>

<i>Although pfeil testified</i>
<i>that it was just a joke,</i>

<i>she was still found guilty</i>
<i>of endangering children.</i>

<i>This fear really took root</i>
<i>in the 1970s</i>

<i>when outlets like newsweek</i>
<i>were reporting</i>

<i>that several children had died</i>
<i>from poison or tainted candy.</i>

Some schools stopped
celebrating Halloween.

They stopped using the word
"Halloween",

and they start talking
about having a fall festival.

New Jersey passed a law of
specifying penalties for people

who were caught contaminating
Halloween treats.

<i>In the 1980s, hospitals</i>
<i>began offering X-ray treats.</i>

<i> All nextcare urgent</i>
<i>care locations</i>

<i>are offering free candy x-rays</i>
<i>through tomorrow.</i>

We haven't had any instances

where we found
any tampered candy,

but you read it in the news

and you see all of these
crazy pictures online,

and so, you know,
if I were a parent,

I would be a little bit
concerned as well.

<i> We don't worry about</i>
<i>ghosts and goblins anymore,</i>

but we fear this maniac,

this anonymous person
who is so crazy

that he presumably poisons
little children at random.

I think about how much fun
Halloween is.

I also worry a little bit
about the things

that can spoil
the fun of Halloween.

Those kinds of things scare me,
too, but in a different way.

<i>The one case of tainted candy</i>

<i>that seemed to bring</i>
<i>this nightmare to life</i>

<i>happened on a rainy Halloween</i>
<i>night in Pasadena, Texas.</i>

<i>The perpetrator</i>
<i>of this evil crime</i>

<i>is known to some</i>
<i>as the man who killed Halloween</i>

<i>and to others as simply</i>
<i>the candy man.</i>

<i>On October 31, 1974,</i>

<i>after trick-or-treating</i>
<i>with their friends,</i>
<i>the bateses,</i>

<i>Ronald o'Bryan let his son</i>
<i>Timothy, age 8,</i>

<i>and his sister Elizabeth, 5,</i>

<i>each pick out a piece of candy</i>
<i>before bed.</i>

<i>Timothy, still wearing his</i>
<i>planet of the apes costume,</i>

<i>chose a giant pixy styx,</i>

<i>one of five</i>
<i>that his father had gotten</i>

<i>from a neighborhood house</i>
<i>that night.</i>

<i>Ronald had divvyed up</i>
<i>the other styx to his daughter,</i>

<i>one of the bates' kids,</i>

<i>and a local boy</i>
<i>named Whitney Parker.</i>

<i>The sugar inside</i>
<i>had clumped together,</i>

<i>so Ronald rolled the styx</i>
<i>in his hands</i>

<i>before pouring the powder</i>
<i>down his son's throat.</i>

<i>Minutes later,</i>
<i>Timothy was violently vomiting,</i>

<i>and after being rushed</i>
<i>to the hospital,</i>

<i>he was pronounced dead.</i>

<i>The cause...</i>
<i>cyanide poisoning.</i>

I was off duty at the time
on Halloween night

when I received a call
from one of my detectives.

<i>I drove to southmore hospital,</i>

and what I saw
was very, very disturbing...

not only because there was
a child there that was dead

that had cyanide foam
coming out of his mouth,

<i>but it was a small,</i>
<i>blond-headed young boy,</i>

<i>and I looked at this child...</i>

and I had at the time
a small, blond-headed,

eight-year-old son
lying in a bed in my home...

and it absolutely
just almost destroyed you

to see something like that.

<i> Had you ever heard</i>
<i>of the idea of</i>

<i>candy tampering before that?</i>

<i>I had heard about it...</i>

<i>I had never seen it personally,</i>

but you know, you're always
concerned on Halloween,

<i>and the next night</i>
<i>we had a grieving father,</i>

a grieving mother,
and a grieving little sister.

I put my arm around
Mr. o'Bryan's shoulder

and I promised him,
"I promise you we will catch

this individual
that did this to your son."

<i> Timothy's death</i>
<i>was a terrible blow,</i>

<i>not just for the family,</i>
<i>but for many in Pasadena.</i>

<i>As crowds of o'Bryan's</i>
<i>fellow churchgoers</i>

<i>flooded the cemetery,</i>

<i>Timothy's father quickly</i>
<i>reduced the mourners to tears</i>

<i>as he sang a hymn for the boy</i>
<i>who was now in heaven.</i>

I introduced myself
to Mr. o'Bryan

and said I'm a reporter
for the Houston chronicle.

Is Mrs. o'Bryan
available to talk?

He said, you know,
she's really, as we all are,

just torn up about this,
but if you want to talk,

come on in,
and I'll try to talk to you.

<i>And he said, you know,</i>
<i>I held my son in my arms</i>

<i>while he died, and I cried.</i>

I thought
that they had been victimized

by a random crazy man, lunatic.

<i>The original suspects</i>
<i>were people in Pasadena</i>

who were living inhabitants
of the homes

where they did
the trick-or-treat.

<i>4108, 4106,</i>

<i>-102.</i>

<i>Right here.</i>

<i>4102.</i>

<i>So right here</i>
<i>is the bates' house</i>

<i>from where o'Bryan</i>
<i>and the bateses</i>

both went trick-or-treating.

<i>After the funeral,</i>

<i>the police took o'Bryan around</i>
<i>the bates' neighborhood,</i>

<i>but he couldn't</i>
<i>remember the house</i>

<i>where he had gotten</i>
<i>the pixy styk.</i>

<i>Finally, he ID'd a neighbor</i>
<i>named Courtney Melvin.</i>

<i>Ten, right here</i>
<i>where this blue car is.</i>

<i>This is Courtney Melvin's place,</i>

<i>so basically Courtney</i>
<i>was out on his lawn.</i>

<i>O'Bryan was driving by,</i>
<i>fingered this guy</i>

<i>as being the person</i>
<i>where he got the pixy styx.</i>

<i>The only problem being</i>

<i>Courtney Melvin</i>
<i>had an airtight alibi.</i>

<i>As the killer continued</i>
<i>to elude police,</i>

<i>the nature of his crime</i>

<i>only seemed to confirm</i>
<i>everyone's worst fears...</i>

<i>a fear that still</i>
<i>resonates today.</i>

<i>Do you know about the crime</i>
<i>that happened?</i>

Oh, yes, you're talking about
the candy man.

<i>Yeah.</i>

Uh-hm.
It was the first time

that I heard of people
doing that...

And then I heard of them
putting more cyanide

and razor blades.

I've heard fish hooks.

<i>The way society is getting</i>
<i>right now, I mean,</i>

you don't ever know
what's going to happen.

I'm like, nope, no candy until
I look, you know, through it.

<i>What are you looking for?</i>

You know, an open wrapper,

just seeing if anything
has a hole in it.

You don't trust nobody.

<i>- Yeah.</i>
Can't.

I actually heard
about some guy doing it

in this neighborhood one time,
but...

What's that story.

I think he actually lived
over there by the ditch.

And they do all sacrifice crap
over there during Halloween.

Do you think there are
satanists around?

There probably is.

I mean, knowing this
neighborhood...

there are sickos around here.

<i>Tonight is Halloween</i>

<i>and children will be out</i>
<i>to trick-or-treat.</i>

<i>We hope that the treats</i>
<i>will be many</i>

<i>and the tricks ingenious.</i>

<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>people give children</i>

<i>bad things on Halloween.</i>

<i>In shreveport, Louisiana,</i>

<i>an old legend that actually</i>
<i>happened this time.</i>

<i>Halloween is on Sunday,</i>

<i>and there is a spreading fear</i>
<i>that this year,</i>

<i>the real Halloween scare</i>

<i>will be many more cases</i>
<i>of contaminated treats.</i>

<i> The term that gets used</i>
<i>is "Halloween sadist".</i>

People assume
that the Halloween sadist

was some crazy person who,
for some reason...

presumably you know,
some psychological problem...

<i>gets pleasure or satisfaction</i>
<i>from hurting little kids.</i>

<i>Many people believe</i>

<i>the Halloween sadist</i>
<i>was behind Timothy's death,</i>

<i>but the real culprit</i>
<i>was more horrific</i>

<i>than anyone had ever imagined.</i>

It's down here,
I think, on the left.

<i>All right, so gray,</i>
<i>how do you want to do this?</i>

I'll just, I'll hang back here.

<i> Okay.</i>
<i>So we're going to go up.</i>

I'm not totally into this.

I can understand.

I can understand
why you'd want to do this...

<i>Yeah.</i>

It just makes me feel
a little uncomfortable.

Knocking on someone's house

and telling them
what tragedy happened here.

<i> Well, you wouldn't</i>
<i>want to know?</i>

Oh, hey, how are you?

Hi, how are you?

Hey, sorry to bother you.
We wanted to talk to you.

We're doing a documentary
and wanted to talk to you

about the family
that lived here before.

Do you know him?

Do you know
Ronald Clark o'Bryan?

Uh-uh.

No, you have no idea about him?

Nah, don't worry about it.

Thanks very much.

You want to know?
Do you really want to know?

Do you really want to know?

So the guy who lived in here

was a guy named
Ronald Clark o'Bryan.

He gave his son
a poison pixy styk.

Yeah.
He killed...

That's right.

<i>On Halloween night,</i>

<i>eight-year-old Timothy o'Bryan</i>
<i>of Pasadena, Texas,</i>

<i>died after eating a piece of</i>
<i>trick-or-treat candy</i>

<i>that contained cyanide.</i>

<i>Today Pasadena police arrested</i>
<i>the boy's father,</i>

<i>30-year-old Ronald o'Bryan,</i>
<i>on murder charges.</i>

<i>Police refused to</i>
<i>discuss the case</i>

<i>other than to say</i>
<i>the district attorney believes</i>

<i>he has sufficient evidence</i>
<i>to file charges.</i>

<i> After receiving a call</i>
<i>from an insurance agent,</i>

<i>police discovered o'Bryan</i>
<i>had taken out a large policy</i>

<i>on his kids but not himself</i>
<i>nor his wife.</i>

<i>Even more damning,</i>

<i>he had talked to</i>
<i>numerous people</i>
<i>about death by cyanide</i>

<i>and had even tried</i>
<i>to buy the chemical</i>

<i>from local companies.</i>

<i>All evidence pointed</i>
<i>to Timothy's father</i>

<i>as the killer which,</i>
<i>as horrific as it sounds,</i>

<i>makes some sense,</i>

<i>and that's because</i>
<i>the Halloween sadist is a myth,</i>

<i>and the notion</i>
<i>of candy tampering</i>

<i>is really an urban legend.</i>

The idea that this is
a big social problem is a myth.

I can't tell you
nobody has ever contaminated

a piece of candy,

but I can't find any evidence
that anybody has ever been hurt,

seriously hurt or killed,
from a contaminated treat

picked up in the course of
trick-or-treating.

<i>If there's no such thing</i>

<i>as the Halloween sadist,</i>

<i>who is, in fact, doing that?</i>

Probably the kids.

<i>If you think about it,</i>

<i>this is a terrific</i>
<i>kind of prank.</i>

<i>It's easy enough</i>
<i>to come by a pin,</i>

<i>easy enough to stick it</i>
<i>in the candy bar,</i>

and then run in and say,
look mom,

there's a pin in my candy bar...

and you become the object
of the concerned attention

of your parents
and possibly even the press

and the police.

<i> While the fear of</i>
<i>tainted candy may be hysteria,</i>

<i>Timothy's death was real...</i>

<i>but was it really conceivable</i>

<i>that a father could kill</i>
<i>his own child...</i>

<i>and if so, what kind of monster</i>
<i>was Ronald Clark o'Bryan?</i>

Look at that lying
son of a bitch.

<i>I thought just like Mr. o'Bryan</i>
<i>wanted us to think...</i>

that there was some maniac
out there

randomly giving these poison
pixy styx to little kids.

That's exactly what
he wanted us to think,

and that's what we thought.

It's hard to accept
that a human being

was willing to do that,

and it's still difficult
for all of us.

The people in this case were
forever affected by what he did

and by that,
I mean the bates kids...

he was going to kill
his friends own two kids...

and little Whitney Parker,

and he would have
killed his daughter

if the ambulance and police
hadn't gotten there so fast.

No good prosecutor wants to go
to trial at all on anything

unless they believe
in their own heart

that the defendant is guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt,

and seeking the death penalty
is just an extra dimension

of care and consideration
that should be given.

You wanted to keep the case.

I sure did.
Why?

I wanted to hopefully
have a hand

in seeing that justice was done

and that he would die
for what he did.

<i>It took a jury only 45 minutes</i>

<i>to find o'Bryan guilty</i>

<i>and another 75</i>
<i>to sentence him to death.</i>

<i>In a fitting irony,</i>

<i>he was scheduled to die on</i>
<i>October 31, 1976, Halloween.</i>

<i> I have stated</i>
<i>from the very beginning</i>

<i>that I had absolutely</i>
<i>nothing at all to do with this.</i>

<i>I maintain that now,</i>

<i>and I'll willing</i>
<i>to take a polygraph now,</i>

<i>just like I was</i>
<i>from the very first time</i>

<i>that they arrested me.</i>

<i>Because I have no guilt,</i>

<i>I'm not worried about what</i>
<i>happens to my physical body.</i>

<i>When I die,</i>
<i>I know where I'm going.</i>

<i> You're going straight</i>
<i>to hell, buddy.</i>

<i> All these appeals</i>
<i>have been turned down</i>

<i>appeal after appeal,</i>
<i>and everybody is saying</i>

<i>you will be executed</i>
<i>this Saturday.</i>

<i>This could be</i>
<i>your last news conference.</i>

<i>What are your final thoughts?</i>

<i>As long as I have</i>

<i>verifiable options open to me,</i>

<i>I will pursue them.</i>

<i>Are you ever going to change</i>

<i>your proclamation of innocence</i>
<i>or...</i>

<i> No,</i>
<i>why should I? It's the truth.</i>

<i>When you consider victims,</i>

<i>the victim of this crime</i>
<i>actually turns out to be me.</i>

<i>O'Bryan had been sent</i>

<i>to Texas's infamous</i>
<i>huntsville prison</i>

<i>which to this day,</i>

<i>houses the most active</i>
<i>death chamber in the us,</i>

<i>but this was 1982,</i>

<i>and after a lengthy debate</i>
<i>in the supreme court</i>

<i>and numerous stays of execution,</i>

<i>o'Bryan was to be one</i>
<i>of the very first inmates</i>

<i>to be executed with</i>
<i>the reinstituted death penalty.</i>

<i>Yet, despite his crime,</i>

<i>o'Bryan still managed</i>
<i>to find his supporters.</i>

There were people

who were in favor
of saving Ronald Clark o'Bryan

in spite of
the overwhelming evidence

and the horror of the crime.

Their position was

we are categorically
opposed to the death penalty.

There also were
counter-protestors

who were in favor
of the death penalty.

<i>They included a lot of students</i>

<i>from the university located here</i>

<i>including many who complained</i>

about what had happened
to Halloween.

This is Ronald Clark o'Bryan.

Mr. o'Bryan is 39 years old.

It looks like you are
going to be executed.

Would you agree with that?

It's a possibility.

I've been aware
of that possibility

since the sentence
was handed down.

It doesn't make it right.

It's fair to say

that nobody gets any joy
out of executing anybody,

but it is also clear
that most Americans

want to get on with this.

<i>They are upset</i>
<i>that you're alive.</i>

I-I can see that point, sure,
but here again,

I don't think
that revenge is right.

I don't think society
is entitled to revenge.

<i>You are accused of ruining</i>
<i>Halloween for everybody.</i>

Well,
that's a matter of opinion.

<i>March 31, 1984,</i>

<i>the day of o'Bryan's execution</i>
<i>had finally arrived.</i>

<i>He was to be executed</i>
<i>just after midnight.</i>

<i>As the hour approached,</i>
<i>the frenzy outside</i>

<i>reached a fever pitch.</i>

<i> Demonstrators</i>
<i>were outside the prison</i>

<i>waiting for the announcement</i>
<i>they wanted to hear.</i>

<i>Parents of other murdered</i>
<i>children joined the vigil.</i>

You know, how could anyone do
something to their own child?

<i>Dying together.</i>

What all of us would give

to have the chance
to have ours back.

<i> Do you think Halloween</i>
<i>will ever be the same again?</i>

<i>Oh, I don't think Halloween</i>
<i>has changed a great deal,</i>

<i>except maybe gotten</i>
<i>a little safer.</i>

<i><i>At exactly 12:40 A.M.</i>

<i>O'Bryan was injected with</i>
<i>a lethal cocktail of drugs,</i>

<i>twice the normal amount,</i>

<i>to account for</i>
<i>his 250-pound weight.</i>

<i>After o'Bryan's eyes fluttered,</i>

<i>his chest heaved,</i>
<i>and it was over.</i>

<i>Ronald o'Bryan,</i>

<i>the man fellow inmates</i>
<i>called the candy man,</i>

<i>was killed by lethal injection</i>
<i>this morning</i>

<i>at a huntsville, Texas, prison.</i>

<i> Ronald o'Bryan</i>
<i>went to his deathbed</i>

<i>never admitting</i>
<i>that he killed his own son.</i>

<i>But in a final statement,</i>

<i>the condemned man</i>
<i>did ask to be forgiven.</i>

<i>Also to anyone</i>
<i>I have offended in any way</i>

<i>during my 39 years.</i>

<i>I pray and ask your forgiveness,</i>

<i>just as I forgive anyone</i>
<i>who offended me in any way.</i>

<i>Ronald o'Bryan is dead.</i>

<i>His ex-wife sees the execution</i>
<i>as the end of a nightmare,</i>

<i>and a chance</i>
<i>for a brand new beginning.</i>

<i> For many the idea</i>
<i>that we were killing the man</i>

<i>who killed Halloween</i>
<i>seemed justified.</i>

<i>O'Bryan had to die</i>
<i>so we could have our fun back.</i>

People were celebrating it,
there's no question about it,

<i>but it was</i>
<i>kind of a catharsis, really,</i>

<i>and people welcomed the event.</i>

He really had not just
desecrated the family tie,

<i>but he had actually</i>
<i>in some fundamental way</i>

<i>desecrated the idea of Halloween</i>

by taking a scary story
and literally making it true.

<i>What he did is</i>

<i>he used the urban legend</i>
<i>as a smokescreen.</i>

<i>He used it as an alibi.</i>

<i>I couldn't have done it</i>

<i>because this is</i>
<i>the sort of thing</i>

that an anonymous
creepy killer would do,

and we all know that
because of urban legends.

<i>In the ultimate irony,</i>

<i>o'Bryan's decision to enact</i>
<i>the tainted candy myth</i>

<i>turned fiction into reality,</i>

<i>allowing the candy man</i>
<i>to continue haunting Halloween</i>

<i>for generations to come.</i>

Look, it's right there.

<i>Mr. o'Bryan, your case</i>

<i>has probably created terror</i>
<i>in the hearts of parents.</i>

<i>In fact, I'm told</i>
<i>that the inmates</i>

<i>occasionally refer to you</i>
<i>as the candy man, is that so?</i>

<i>A babysitter is watching TV</i>

<i>after putting the kids to bed</i>

<i>when she gets a call</i>
<i>from a mysterious stranger.</i>

Hello.

Have you checked the children?

What?

<i> Thinking it's a prank,</i>
<i>she hangs up.</i>

<i>A few minutes later,</i>

<i>the same mysterious man</i>
<i>calls again.</i>

Hello?

Have you checked the children?

<i>Only now the question ends</i>

with a devilish laugh.

<i>The babysitter reports the call.</i>

Hello, could you
get me the police.

I've been getting
weird phone calls.

<i> After a few minutes,</i>
<i>a hurried voice calls back.</i>

Leave me alone!

<i> Jill,</i>
<i>this is sergeant sachar.</i>

<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>We've traced the call.</i>

The caller is in the house.

<i>The calls are coming</i>
<i>from the house.</i>

<i>It's coming from</i>
<i>inside the house.</i>

<i> Just at that moment,</i>
<i>the babysitter looks over</i>

<i>as a man is coming</i>
<i>down the stairs.</i>

Well, that really happened
to a girl in my hometown.

Oh, yes. I'm sure it did.

I'm sure most of you grew up

thinking that this happened
to girls in all your hometowns,

but it didn't.

<i> Yes, the babysitter</i>
<i>and the man upstairs</i>

<i>is a popular urban legend,</i>

<i>but is there any truth</i>
<i>behind it?</i>

<i>One would think so</i>
<i>considering all these examples,</i>

<i>but when dealing</i>
<i>with urban legends,</i>

<i>the truth is never</i>
<i>quite what it seems.</i>

<i>When I think babysitter,</i>

<i>I think about me babysitting</i>
<i>as a teenager</i>

and how fearful I was.

You know,
being in a strange house,

hearing strange sounds,
not being familiar,

but what was interesting

is that I started researching
babysitters,

thinking that I wouldn't
have a hard time

finding a case of a babysitter

<i>by following some kind of</i>
<i>death or kidnapping,</i>

the children upstairs
being killed or whatever.

It's very difficult to find
any true crimes

to connect
this urban legend line.

<i>One thing that's interesting</i>

<i>about babysitting is that it</i>
<i>doesn't increase your danger</i>

of being attacked at all.

<i>It would be</i>
<i>a completely random event</i>

<i>for a babysitter to be attacked</i>
<i>during a house burglary,</i>

<i>but it induces anxiety</i>
<i>because suddenly</i>

they're responsible for
these other people's kids,

<i>and it has nothing to do</i>
<i>with your potential</i>

<i>for becoming a crime victim...</i>

<i>but it may be getting it</i>
<i>expressed in stories</i>

<i>in which the babysitter</i>
<i>becomes the crime victim.</i>

<i> You would think</i>
<i>with the amount of babysitters</i>

getting killed
in popular culture now,

like, we would have just like
gotten a case immediately.

Oh, it took me
to going back to the '50s

to actually find one.

We found this case
of janett christman

here in Columbia, Missouri,
which is why we're here.

<i>My name is Carol Haley holt,</i>

and I was a very good friend
of janett christman

from first grade
through the time of her death.

<i>It was march 18, 1950.</i>

Janett was babysitting
for the romack family

out kind of in the west edge
of Columbia...

it really wasn't
in the city limits.

<i>It was kind of an eerie night.</i>

<i>I also was babysitting,</i>
<i>and I just felt uneasy,</i>

<i>and that was unusual for me</i>

<i>because I did</i>
<i>quite a bit of babysitting...</i>

but I just felt that something
was going on about 12 o'clock,

and I even got up
to check the door

and make sure it was locked,

went in to check
the little boy...

he was fine.

And then the next morning,
the phone rang.

My mother went in to answer

<i>and told me that janett</i>
<i>had been killed</i>

<i>while she was babysitting.</i>

<i>I had heard that</i>

there had been a phone call
to the police.

Well, Mrs. romack tried to call

to check on janett
with the thunder,

and she was afraid
the little boy might wake up...

and she tried to call
and received a busy signal.

<i> What the romack</i>
<i>family didn't know</i>

<i>is that janett</i>
<i>had called the police</i>

<i>while she was being attacked,</i>

<i>but the only thing they heard</i>
<i>were desperate screams.</i>

<i>Unable to trace the call,</i>

<i>the police were helpless</i>
<i>to stop her murder.</i>

Janett had skin
under her fingernails.

She had many abrasions
on her body,

<i>but the final thing was</i>

that she was strangled
with an ironing cord.

I know she suffered a lot
before she finally succumbed.

<i>Janett christman's death</i>

<i>shocked the small town</i>
<i>of Columbia, Missouri,</i>

<i>but despite being one of</i>
<i>the most publicized crimes</i>

<i>in the past 60 years,</i>

<i>her murder</i>
<i>has never been solved.</i>

So right now, we're looking
for ed romack's house

where janett christman
was murdered

while she was babysitting.

1015 should be
somewhere along here.

<i>So then it must be that one.</i>

<i>That house right there?</i>
<i>Right there, right there.</i>

<i>Quick question for you,</i>

<i>is this where ed romack</i>
<i>used to live?</i>

<i>Is that this house?</i>

<i>Maybe.</i>

<i> But you don't know</i>
<i>anything about it.</i>

Uh-hm.

About two years ago,
this car pulled up

and they were out there talking
and pointing here at this house,

and they said
we're trying to figure out

which house where a girl
was babysitting a little baby,

and she got murdered and raped.

<i>Uh-hm.</i>

And I said, no,
it's not this house,

it's that one.

<i>Uh-hm.</i>

It was a man talking to me.
He said, "I was the baby."

<i>No!</i>

<i>Wow!</i>

And a different woman that
lived across west boulevard,

and she had been
raped and murdered

sometime within close
to that time.

<i> Jenkins is it?</i>
Yes.

<i>Jenkins, right.</i>

We went to...
I went to the trial. Yeah.

<i> Marylou Jenkins</i>
<i>was the other reason</i>

<i>we were in Columbia.</i>

<i>On February 6, 1946,</i>
<i>marylou, age 20,</i>

<i>was home alone</i>
<i>while her mother was out</i>

<i>caring for an elderly neighbor.</i>

<i>The next morning she came home</i>
<i>to find marylou dead.</i>

<i>Much like janett christman's</i>
<i>murder four years later,</i>

<i>marylou had been raped</i>
<i>and strangled</i>

<i>with an electrical cord.</i>

<i>A mentally-challenged man</i>
<i>named Floyd Cochran</i>

<i>who had been arrested</i>
<i>for killing his wife</i>

<i>was charged with the murder</i>
<i>and quickly executed.</i>

<i>Do you think Floyd was innocent?</i>

I think
he was likely innocent

of killing marylou Jenkins, yes.

He did kill his wife
in likely a domestic dispute,

but just from reading
the trial transcripts,

it just didn't seem like
he had the wherewithal

to kill and rape a young woman.

Mary Beth brown
is a researcher

who helped shed new light
on these old cold cases.

<i>She believes</i>
<i>the eerie similarities</i>

<i>between the Jenkins murder</i>
<i>and the christman murder</i>

<i>four years later</i>
<i>only proves</i>
<i>Cochran's innocence.</i>

They were both young woman,
they were home by themselves,

they were both found
with electrical cords

wrapped around their neck,

but cords that weren't attached
or torn from the appliance...

they were actually cut.

The whole location thing
is the one that really gets me.

<i>Like how close was it?</i>

<i>Within two blocks.</i>

<i> Do you think</i>
<i>that the same person</i>

who killed marylou Jenkins
also killed janett christman?

That's my personal opinion,
but yeah.

<i>And who do you think did it?</i>

I've been told several people,

but more than any other name
was Robert Mueller.

<i>Robert Mueller</i>

<i>was a high school friend</i>
<i>of ed romack's,</i>

<i>and it was the romack's house</i>

<i>where janett was babysitting</i>
<i>that night.</i>

<i>The romacks told police</i>
<i>that Mueller</i>

<i>had often commented</i>
<i>on janett being a virgin</i>

<i>and had eluded to knowing</i>
<i>intimate details of the crime.</i>

<i>Although Mueller had been</i>
<i>taken in for questioning</i>

<i>and passed a polygraph,</i>
<i>the police still felt</i>

<i>there was enough evidence</i>
<i>to arrest him.</i>

<i>However, a grand jury</i>
<i>refused to indict,</i>

<i>and Mueller was never tried</i>
<i>for janett's murder.</i>

<i> I am working</i>
<i>on a documentary,</i>

and I'm interested
in a cold case

that I've been researching.

I wanted to see
if there was any information

that you could give me.

Okay, is that...

did you just like
do something on your system

and you see
there's nothing there?

<i>Despite numerous efforts</i>

<i>to reach out to police,</i>

<i>they were less than responsive.</i>

<i>Christman's case was too old</i>
<i>to warrant attention.</i>

<i>However, we were able to</i>
<i>track down some old case files.</i>

This deputy testified
that romack told him

Mueller had known janett

and admired
her well-developed form.

<i>Oh my God!</i>

<i>There's her leg.</i>

<i>There's the phone.</i>

That's the cord
around her neck, right there.

<i>It's one of those irons</i>
<i>back then with the thick cords.</i>

<i>That's the window</i>
<i>that was broken</i>

<i>that supposedly</i>
<i>whoever did this</i>
<i>went in and out of,</i>

<i>but the venetian blinds...</i>

<i>if someone were going</i>
<i>through there...</i>

<i>they'd be totally ripped up.</i>

The piano, look.

That's the window...
oh, look.

<i>That's the broken glass</i>

<i>and that's why they're saying</i>
<i>nothing is disturbed</i>

<i>because look at the area</i>
<i>around it.</i>

So, inside job.

Uh-hm.

Mueller's wife,
according to the deputy,

had called the girl to baby sit
at the Mueller home that night

and found she had already
been asked by Mrs. romack.

<i>So, Mueller tried to get her</i>

<i>to baby sit that night.</i>

Must have been.

And she was already
babysitting the romacks...

which was how he would know
she would be alone.

I agree that it sounds
like he did it,

but maybe, maybe he didn't.

There's no solid proof,
no hard evidence.

<i> Joan sorrels is another</i>
<i>researcher studying the cases.</i>

<i>She believes other crimes</i>

<i>happening in Columbia</i>
<i>at the time</i>

<i>might be connected</i>
<i>to these murders.</i>

There were rapes

that had occurred
within that period

between the Jenkins murder
and the christman murder.

Tell me about those.

Yeah. Well, there was a rape

that was within two blocks
of the christman murder.

The girl was raped by a man
that wore a mask...

Really?

And when you read the stories...

the reports
of the christman murder...

when they're talking
about Robert Mueller,

<i>it turns out that he was</i>
<i>interested in the theater</i>

<i>and that he made masks.</i>

There was a black man named
Jake Bradford that they charged,

and he had already been in jail,

and he was charged on the rapes.

You assume he was innocent.

Of that.

They took the wrong man,
they really did.

Would you say that Columbia
has like a history of this?

Well, you remember
that I was graduating

from high school in '51.

You would go
to the mu football games

and you would stand up
for Dixie.

What does that mean?

The song<i> dixies</i>...

Uh-hm, okay.

That's a confederate song.

Uh-hm.

Columbia was really primarily
a confederate town.

Basically this is the story
of a young girl...

<i>We came here to investigate</i>

<i>an urban legend,</i>

<i>but what we found</i>
<i>was truly shocking...</i>

<i>the unsolved murders</i>
<i>of two young girls,</i>

<i>a series of brutal rapes,</i>
<i>and the possibility</i>

<i>that men were being falsely</i>
<i>accused and even executed.</i>

<i>In all honesty, the truth</i>
<i>was more unflinchingly real</i>

<i>than we could ever</i>
<i>have imagined.</i>

<i>So right now, we are headed</i>
<i>to hinkson creek.</i>

This is where
a lot of people went to park

back in the '50s, and '40s,
'50s, '60s and still do now.

Yeah.

We just wanted to see
about all the other rapes

that were happening
other than the two houses.

This is the creek
where they're saying

there were a ton of rapes
happening around here.

<i>That.</i>

<i>This is where</i>
<i>the college students go in,</i>

<i>and there's like a car</i>
<i>right out over there</i>

<i>and they just flashed</i>
<i>their lights</i>

because they didn't want us
to walk in on them.

What's down here?

Uh, where they dragged the girl.

<i> Dragged?</i>
Dragged from the car.

There was a couple making out.

Some guy came out of nowhere

and then at gunpoint
pulled one of the girls off

into the woods... and it was
right near Halloween...

and basically this guy
put a mask over his head

<i>and then he put a mask</i>
<i>over the girl's face,</i>

<i>and then he raped her.</i>

I think the more scary thing
was being a woman,

being a girl between
1940 and 1950, in this area,

knowing the amount of things
going on.

I wouldn't have wanted to be
a babysitter back then.

I wouldn't have wanted
to be by myself

in one of those houses.

Most teenagers in the us
go through a period

when they baby sit
at least once or twice,

<i>and it feels very terrifying</i>
<i>to the person who is doing it,</i>

<i>But it's not actually dangerous</i>
<i>almost at all.</i>

<i>I mean, there's no reason</i>
<i>to imagine</i>

<i>that any killer would even know</i>

<i>that a babysitter was on duty</i>
<i>in the house,</i>

<i>and it makes the most sense</i>
<i>if you think about the fact</i>

<i>that maybe he knew she was</i>
<i>going to be there babysitting</i>

and maybe
he did this specifically

to torment the babysitter,

and that is
exactly what happened,

they think,
in the Columbia case.

<i> Was somebody tormenting</i>
<i>the babysitters in Columbia...</i>

<i>and was the same person</i>
<i>responsible for the sex crimes</i>

<i>that had terrorized this town...</i>

<i>and finally</i>
<i>was this same person</i>
<i>Robert Mueller?</i>

<i>Hoping for some</i>
<i>additional insight,</i>

<i>we turned to a profiler</i>
<i>in Kansas City,</i>

<i>a former German national</i>
<i>named Peter brendt</i>

<i>who was willing to review</i>
<i>our case.</i>

<i>So in your opinion,</i>
<i>the same killer for both girls.</i>

<i>Yes.</i>
<i>This is too specific</i>

<i>if you add</i>
<i>all of the details together.</i>

Do you think
that marylou Jenkins knew him?

<i>Well, there was no sign</i>
<i>of forced entry on the door,</i>

<i>so at least from the sight,</i>
<i>she must have known him,</i>

<i>and he was non threatening</i>
<i>to her.</i>

Right.
Now let's talk about christman.

<i> Oh, well,</i>
<i>this is a lot more specifics</i>.

<i>If you see</i>
<i>there comes an offender,</i>

<i>he breaks a window.</i>

<i>The victim runs to the kitchen</i>
<i>where the phone is,</i>

<i>and he walks in</i>
<i>through the front door.</i>

<i>Now, why would he do that?</i>

<i>He would do that</i>
<i>only if he knew one detail...</i>

<i>ed romack had shown her</i>
<i>how to use the shortcut.</i>

<i> Peter had brought up</i>
<i>an interesting clue...</i>

<i>one that many had overlooked.</i>

<i>Romack testified</i>
<i>that he had shown janett</i>

<i>a loaded shotgun</i>
<i>by the front door.</i>

<i>By breaking the window,</i>

<i>Mueller would distract her</i>
<i>away from the gun</i>

<i>so he could safely</i>
<i>get inside the house.</i>

<i>He knew how long he would need</i>
<i>around the house,</i>

<i>through the front door</i>
<i>into the kitchen.</i>

<i>So he knew every feet</i>
<i>of the route.</i>

Do you think it was Mueller?

<i>He fits the bill,</i>

<i>but a lot of other males</i>
<i>of the town</i>

<i>would fit that bill, too.</i>

<i>And the problem is</i>
<i>he passed his lie detector.</i>

<i>Now, if you have even 20%</i>
<i>to 40% cycle passes it makes...</i>

<i>a lie detector,</i>

<i>especially an old model</i>
<i>from the '50s,</i>

<i>um, well, it's worthless.</i>

Now the other interesting thing

is that the rapes and murders
stopped when he left town.

<i>Well, that looks not good</i>
<i>on the other side.</i>

<i>What was it, half a million</i>
<i>young males went to Korea?</i>

<i>So he wasn't the only one</i>
<i>who left the area.</i>

<i>I mean he would</i>
<i>so nicely fit the bill,</i>

<i>but that's the risky part</i>
<i>with profiles, yeah?</i>

<i>A profile states</i>
<i>not who the killer is</i>

<i>but what the killer is.</i>

<i>I think it's interesting</i>

<i>that he thinks whoever this is,</i>

he knew her...
he knew both.

<i> Although we'll</i>
<i>never be able to prove</i>

<i>who committed all these crimes,</i>

<i>the evidence strongly suggests</i>

<i>that janett christman</i>
<i>knew her killer.</i>

There really is not
a strong tradition in America

of strangers coming in
and killing babysitters.

<i>Babysitters killing</i>
<i>small children, yes,</i>

<i>but the stranger</i>
<i>on babysitter story</i>

just doesn't connect up with
a widespread real social fear.

<i> What the babysitter</i>
<i>and the man upstairs</i>

<i>seems to be about</i>
<i>is this warning</i>

<i>about this kind of</i>
<i>responsibility.</i>

If you're taking
this responsibility,

you have to take it seriously.

So, you have this voice
that calls her up on the phone

and almost like a conscience,

asks have you checked
the children,

<i>and she hasn't</i>
<i>checked the children,</i>

<i>and that's one of the reasons</i>
<i>why she doesn't know</i>

<i>that they've been murdered.</i>

<i>I think it makes more sense</i>

<i>to look at it in a simple way</i>

and say the babysitter is
dealing with her own anxieties

of being potentially the cause
of the children's death...

and the killer upstairs
is the killer upstairs for her.

The tragic case
of janett christman

<i>only goes to prove</i>
<i>bill Ellis's point</i>

<i>that our portrayal of the man</i>
<i>upstairs is incorrect...</i>

<i>and that's because the truth</i>
<i>is more terrifying</i>

<i>than we can ever imagine.</i>

<i>Janett christman</i>
<i>knew her killer,</i>

<i>and if it's true</i>
<i>that her killer was Mueller</i>

<i>as so many in Columbia</i>
<i>have suggested,</i>

<i>then the man tormenting her</i>
<i>that fateful night</i>

<i>wasn't any stranger.</i>

<i>So now we go from</i>
<i>Columbia, Missouri,</i>

<i>to Chicago in the 1980s...</i>

<i>from the small town</i>
<i>to the big city.</i>

<i>For some,</i>
<i>it is a loss of innocence,</i>

<i>and nothing speaks to that loss</i>
<i>more than clowns.</i>

<i>We used to think of clowns</i>
<i>as fairly happy characters.</i>

<i>Yes, sometimes</i>
<i>they were sad or hapless,</i>

<i>but ultimately they were</i>
<i>harmless caricatures.</i>

<i>Of course, clown faces</i>
<i>were exaggerated and garish,</i>

<i>but that's because of</i>
<i>the far distances</i>

<i>between the audience</i>
<i>and the ring.</i>

<i>It wasn't the clown's fault,</i>
<i>or was it?</i>

<i>Before modern times,</i>
<i>the clown...</i>

<i>or more appropriately</i>
<i>the Jester...</i>

<i>was considered</i>
<i>a mischievous trickster</i>

<i>whose special role</i>
<i>allowed them to mock nobility.</i>

<i>Jesters served to entertain,</i>
<i>but it wasn't all smiles.</i>

<i>These clowns had a mean streak,</i>
<i>and they played it to the hilt.</i>

<i>But what was it</i>
<i>about the clowns of today</i>

<i>that turned them</i>
<i>into something evil?</i>

Breakfast.

I'm hungry.

<i> Some believe</i>
<i>it was when we brought clowns</i>

<i>out of the big top</i>
<i>and into our homes</i>

<i>via birthday parties and TV,</i>

<i>that things</i>
<i>really began to change.</i>

We see you here as bozo.
Who are you really?

<i> Had that</i>
<i>suspicious gleam in the eye</i>

<i>been there all along?</i>

<i>Did we finally just put</i>
<i>two and two together to realize</i>

<i>that clowns were creepy</i>
<i>or even worse...</i>

<i>dangerous?</i>

<i>The news at 5.</i>

<i>Chicago police warned parents</i>

<i>about a man dressed as a clown</i>
<i>who is approaching children.</i>

<i>Police say a clown</i>
<i>tried to lure boys</i>

<i>into his pickup truck</i>
<i>last Tuesday evening.</i>

<i>Police have issued</i>
<i>two community alerts</i>

<i>regarding the clown sighting</i>
<i>near some southside schools</i>

<i>as well as</i>
<i>some westside schools.</i>

<i>No one can say for sure</i>

<i>where in Chicago</i>
<i>it happened first or even when,</i>

<i>but they were out there,</i>
<i>snatching kids off the streets.</i>

<i>They trolled playgrounds</i>
<i>and schoolyards.</i>

<i>Sometimes they used</i>
<i>balloons or candy</i>

<i>to lure the gullible ones.</i>

<i>But ask anyone</i>
<i>who has seen them,</i>

<i>and they'll all tell you</i>
<i>the same thing...</i>

<i>it was the white van</i>
<i>they saw first</i>

<i>and then that face</i>
<i>behind the wheel</i>

<i>painted white</i>
<i>with a maniacal smile.</i>

<i>We call them the killer clowns,</i>

<i>and they only wanted</i>
<i>one thing...</i>

<i>to kidnap kids just like us.</i>

<i> Police are saying</i>
<i>that the suspect</i>

<i>wears clown make-up, a wig,</i>

<i>and sometimes</i>
<i>he carried balloons.</i>

<i>The latest pair of incidents</i>

<i>occurred near playgrounds</i>
<i>at 83rd and mackinaw...</i>

They were running out
of the playground area.

To prey on children
at this time, you know,

right around the time
that they want to go out

and do trick-or-treating
is unfortunate.

We should emphasize
that nothing has happened...

no child has been hurt...

but certainly these incidents
that have been near children

is making it very uneasy.

<i> In 2008, this was</i>
<i>one of the reported sightings...</i>

South mackinaw...

one of the theoretical
clown abductions

where apparently he was hiding
in the playground

with some balloons...

Or he was in a van
or he was in a truck.

<i>I mean, no adult</i>
<i>said they saw this.</i>

<i>Something was going on</i>
<i>with these children</i>

to feel the need
to alert adults.

You doing a documentary?

Yeah, we are.

<i> Do you believe</i>
<i>that really happened?</i>

Yeah, oh sure.

<i> Why do you believe</i>
<i>that happened?</i>

Well, people told me, you know,

that they actually seen that.

Was it just one incident
or was it...

No, it was like a couple weeks
or you know,

a month or something like
that it was going on.

<i>Did they ever catch the guy?</i>

I'm not sure.

I think they did
because it stopped.

Definitely
it was a true incident.

Uh-hm.
Uh-hm.

So, he believes...

He believes it.
It was-it was real.

I think there could possibly
have been a clown here.

It's hard to discern.

A white van
and the guy had a mask...

Uh-hm.
...Of a clown.

One of our friends' daughters...

yeah, and she was holding on

like for dear life to the fence.

<i> Really?</i>
Yeah.

<i> Do you believe</i>
<i>it really happened?</i>

I believe so.

We have tons and tons
of pedophiles

in this community.
I always log on to it.

<i> Really?</i>
Oh yes.

Dressing as a clown?

Yeah.

That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

No.

<i>But you never saw the clown.</i>

No, but we saw people
that acted like that person...

trying to lure...
tell the kids.

I saw him right in the store
and I warned the store owner.

I'd like for people
to hear the truth

Not a lie.

Now I don't know what to think.

<i> Walking away,</i>
<i>it was hard not to believe</i>

that there must be
some truth to this.

Could all these people
really be wrong?

Maybe our fear of clowns
isn't just in our heads.

<i> Coulrophobia</i>
<i>is the fear of clowns.</i>

It is so widespread now
that, you know,

everybody knows that people
are afraid of clowns.

Everybody knows that something
is up with clowns,

<i>and the last couple of decades</i>
<i>have just been confirmation</i>

<i>of everything they ever feared.</i>

<i>But what's even more disturbing</i>

<i>is that these phantom clowns</i>
<i>didn't just appear in 2008.</i>

<i>There was a similar sighting</i>
<i>17 years previously,</i>

<i>in the fall of 1991.</i>

<i>From the number of</i>
<i>alleged sightings</i>

<i>coming from practically</i>
<i>all over Chicago,</i>

<i>police are theorizing</i>

there may be more
than one phony clown

out roaming the streets.

<i>This is a comment.</i>

<i>"I've seen the same van</i>
<i>with the clown driving</i>

<i>when we was on the westside</i>
<i>playing,</i>

<i>and I can recall the van</i>
<i>stopping in the alley</i>

<i>and the clown trying to</i>
<i>lure me to the van.</i>

<i>That scared me worser</i>

than living in cabrini-green
projects."

<i> The mention of</i>
<i>cabrini-green was telling.</i>

<i>It had been one of Chicago's</i>
<i>most notorious slums</i>

<i>where kids faced</i>
<i>rampant poverty and</i>
<i>violence on a daily basis.</i>

<i>But how does a kid process</i>

<i>these overwhelming</i>
<i>societal issues</i>

<i>that are just too big to fix?</i>

Have you ever like
heard of any talk

about any scary place
on your block,

<i>a place nobody went to?</i>

Every block is a scary block...

So much shooting
and killing out here.

You guys think clowns are scary?

Clowns?
Yeah.

No.

<i>Killer clowns.</i>

Killer clowns.

We've got a real shot here,
Bernadette.

An entire community
starts attributing

the daily horrors of their lives
to a mythical figure.

<i>Sometimes we create monsters.</i>

<i>Sometimes we just need</i>
<i>to put a face on our fear.</i>

Aren't you going to say hello?

This is where there was

another series of
clown sightings back in '91.

<i>They called this clown sighting</i>
<i>the homey the clown sighting.</i>

<i>Back in the early '90s,</i>

<i>there was a popular show on,</i>
<i>in living colors.</i>

Huge character on there,
homey the clown.

Now let's show them
how homey gets back at

Mr. establishment.

Sure.

I mean, this is only one
of many, many places

all over Chicago.

<i>There was a real citywide scare.</i>

<i>The Chicago police</i>
<i>were being called.</i>

<i>There were reports in the news.</i>

<i> Isaiah Thompson</i>
<i>was a local reporter</i>

<i>who grew up in Chicago</i>
<i>and wrote about the clowns</i>

<i>that seemed to be lurking</i>
<i>on every corner.</i>

<i>Somehow-you know,</i>

<i>I don't know that anyone</i>
<i>knows how, you know,</i>

<i>this whole city,</i>
<i>especially like this whole</i>

<i>public school network of</i>
<i>thousands and thousands of kids</i>

<i>all believe the same thing,</i>

<i>so it seems like</i>
<i>this larger force of nature</i>

<i>that sort of visited itself</i>
<i>upon the kids of Chicago.</i>

<i> What the kids in 1991</i>
<i>didn't know</i>

<i>was that Chicago had</i>
<i>an even earlier clown scare.</i>

There was another clown scare
phenomenon previously in 1981.

It's been said that that one
started in Boston.

Uh-hm. You think '81,
you think '80s,

you think Steven king,
you think<i> poltergeist.</i>

No, that started in '82,
<i>poltergeist,</i> '86 for<i> it.</i>

This was all before any of that.

<i> It's easy to see</i>
<i>how poltergeist</i>

<i>could have helped</i>
<i>spread a clown scare.</i>

<i>And of course,</i>
<i>Steven king's it...</i>

Ah-ha, I'll drive you crazy
and I'll kill you all.

I'm every nightmare
you ever had.

I am your worst dream come true!

<i> But the fact</i>
<i>that the 1981 scare</i>

<i>preceded these cinematic</i>
<i>killer clowns was telling.</i>

<i>This wasn't just kids</i>
<i>watching some movie,</i>

<i>not when this fear</i>
<i>was everywhere.</i>

<i> Clowns appear</i>
<i>in California in 1967;</i>

<i>in Newark 1980;</i>

<i>Boston; Providence;</i>

<i>Omaha; Phoenix,</i>
<i>Arizona in 1985;</i>

<i>Chicago; Galveston,</i>

<i>Texas, 1992;</i>

<i>Washington; Maryland;</i>

<i>Scotland, 1991;</i>

throughout a large portion
of Latin America

from Mexico to South America
in the mid-90s.

<i>The question of</i>
<i>how it's being spread</i>

is a very interesting one
because you have an age group

which doesn't have
an enormous amount of contacts

<i>and especially</i>
<i>in a pre-Internet time.</i>

Elementary schools
communicating with students

in other elementary schools
on the other side of town

is very unlikely.

How it's transmitted is really
one of the most intriguing,

perhaps unsolved mysteries
about it.

<i>All over the world,</i>

<i>kids were seeing killer clowns,</i>

<i>but it could have been</i>
<i>any monster...</i>

<i>zombies, vampires, witches,</i>
<i>why clowns?</i>

<i>Maybe our fear points</i>
<i>to an even larger issue.</i>

<i>Maybe it was the clown's</i>
<i>loss of innocence</i>

<i>that made them</i>
<i>that much more scary</i>

<i>because it spoke</i>
<i>to our own loss.</i>

<i>For those born</i>
<i>into a generation</i>
<i>of stranger danger,</i>

<i>where missing kids appeared</i>
<i>on every milk carton,</i>

<i>clowns represented a world</i>

<i>that had turned</i>
<i>almost evil overnight,</i>

<i>and that's because</i>
<i>it's here in Chicago</i>

<i>where the notion</i>
<i>of killer clowns</i>

<i>became a reality.</i>

<i> Police found</i>
<i>the decomposed remains</i>

<i>of three bodies.</i>

<i>They suspect there are several</i>
<i>more bodies buried here.</i>

<i> And the most</i>
<i>evil of them all was pogo,</i>

<i>the alter ego of one of the</i>
<i>most prolific serial killers</i>

<i>in all of history,</i>
<i>John Wayne gacy.</i>

<i>Gacy was a sadistic</i>
<i>serial killer</i>

<i>who brutally slayed 33 young men</i>

<i>between 1972 and 1978</i>
<i>in the Chicago suburbs.</i>

<i>Though many have portrayed</i>
<i>gacy as an actual killer clown,</i>

<i>the truth behind</i>
<i>his demented persona</i>

<i>is not so simple.</i>

<i>How many bodies</i>
<i>did you find here?</i>

<i> Twenty-nine,</i>
<i>twenty-seven under the house...</i>

Uh-hm.

In the crawlspace,
one under the driveway...

And one under an extension
that he put on the garage.

<i>This is Bob egans</i>,

<i>a former prosecutor</i>
<i>on the gacy case,</i>

<i>and cook county detective</i>
<i>Jason moran.</i>

<i> When we first saw</i>
<i>the pogo the clown pictures,</i>

<i>we went, oh my God,</i>

<i>is this guy acting as a clown</i>
<i>to get victims...</i>

that's what we thought,
but it wasn't that at all.

He was doing that because
he was the center of attention,

and everything he did

was to make himself
the center of attention.

I still don't like clowns.

And I'm an adult
with a gun and a badge.

And it might be
from being a child

during that time because
if you look at pogo the clown,

he was a very creepy clown.

If you look at the pictures,
the make-up around his eyes

when he was portraying pogo,
was triangular,

and the make-up around his mouth
came up to points.

<i>Clown experts said</i>
<i>clowns do not have</i>

<i>any sharp points on their faces.</i>

Why?

Because it scares kids
and it connotes evil.

And so do you think
gacy did this on purpose

to connote evil?

It was subconscious?
No, I don't think at all.

I think it was
purely coincidental.

He wasn't...

I don't think he was
thinking of that for one second.

<i>I'm telling you, that's exactly</i>
<i>what we believed at the time.</i>

Pogo the clown issue
was the subject

of a lot of conversation
during the trial prep.

<i> Although gacy never did</i>
<i>kill anyone dressed as a clown,</i>

<i>he did tell police clowns</i>
<i>could get away with murder,</i>

<i>leading many to believe</i>
<i>his signature clown look</i>

<i>was in fact a true reflection</i>
<i>of his inner evil self.</i>

<i>Ken melvoin-berg</i>
<i>is a noted historian</i>

<i>who understands</i>
<i>the dark side of a clown.</i>

It doesn't matter the type
of mask that you're putting on...

whether it's a clown face...

it's to hide who you are
a little bit

and to be somebody
a little bit different.

It's oftentimes the opposite
of what we portray ourselves

in our day-to-day lives.

So somebody who is
a truly evil person like gacy

puts it on
to sort of offset that.

<i> What happens</i>
<i>when people costume</i>

<i>is that they're playing with</i>
<i>these internal personalities...</i>

<i>they're repressing</i>
<i>the normal ego...</i>

and they are allowing
some internal personality

to become dominant.

And so you put on
the clown make-up

and you are no longer yourself.

<i>You then become someone</i>
<i>that is unpredictable,</i>

possibly dangerous,
possibly violent.

Game on, my friend.

Ha-ha-ha-ha.

<i>Clowns have always been</i>

<i>a huge thing for us</i>
<i>here in Chicago</i>

unlike any other American city

where we have clowns
and clown stories

and clown mythology
and clown history

that no other city
in the us has.

<i>It started off a long time ago</i>
<i>in the 1890s</i>

<i>when the columbian exposition</i>
<i>brought clowns around</i>

<i>just to entertain folks.</i>

<i>Going forward in time</i>
<i>a little bit,</i>

up into the 1950s, like Bob bell

who was the original
bozo the clown.

<i>The bozo set is still at wgn</i>
<i>in the building,</i>

<i>and it's allegedly haunted.</i>

In the late '70s is when
you had John Wayne gacy.

<i>Shortly after is when</i>

<i>a clown panic happened.</i>

So for people like me
who are a little bit sadistic,

to me it's made it
that much more interesting

because people
are that much more scared

of clowns these days.

The thing is
that all of the people

that were children
in the 1980s and 1990s

are adults now,

and are telling these
terrifying tales of clowns

to their children.

Speaking of the connection
to clowns in Chicago,

the one site that you guys
have got to see

if you haven't been there before
is showmen's rest

which is a monument
to the circus and clowns

in a cemetery.

<i>Buried in Chicago</i>

<i>were the clowns</i>
<i>and other circus performers</i>

<i>who died in one of the worst</i>
<i>train wrecks</i>

<i>in American history.</i>

<i>On June 22, 1918,</i>

<i>after its conductor fell asleep,</i>

<i>a train plowed</i>
<i>into the idle sleeper cars</i>

<i>of the</i>
<i>hagenbeck-Wallace</i>
<i>circus.</i>

<i>Those who weren't killed</i>
<i>in the initial impact</i>

<i>burned to death after</i>
<i>the wooden cars caught on fire.</i>

<i>In all, 86 performers</i>
<i>were killed.</i>

<i>With so many burned</i>
<i>beyond recognition,</i>

<i>they were buried in a mass grave</i>

<i>in a section</i>
<i>of the Chicago cemetery</i>

<i>called showmen's rest.</i>

<i>One of those who survived</i>
<i>was Joe coyle,</i>

<i>a famously jovial clown</i>

<i>whose act became</i>
<i>perpetually sad and morose</i>

<i>as he took to dressing in rags.</i>

<i>Coyle would play a sad clown</i>
<i>for the rest of his life.</i>

<i>Joe coyle spoke bitterly</i>

<i>as he lay on a stretcher</i>

<i>and told how his wife</i>
<i>and two babies</i>

had joined him only recently
and how all three

had been crushed to death
at his very side.

"The kiddies had been so glad
to see their daddy," he said,

"I wish I could have died
with them."

Here, look. See that?

Baldy.

Baldy, 1918, June 22.

They said they
only could name him baldy

because that was the only name
they knew him by

<i> Maybe it all started</i>
<i>in Chicago</i>

<i>with the deaths of these clowns.</i>

<i>Maybe all it takes</i>
<i>is a little tragedy</i>

<i>to unlock the even</i>
<i>darker places</i>
<i>in our mind.</i>

<i>One thing is for certain...</i>

<i>there's no going back</i>
<i>to the innocent clown.</i>

<i>The scales have been tipped</i>
<i>and the evidence proves it.</i>

<i>Clowns can do scary things.</i>

<i>They can even become killers.</i>

<i>...314, shooting</i>
<i>at century theaters.</i>

<i>14300, east Alameda Avenue.</i>

<i>They're saying somebody</i>
<i>is shooting in the auditorium.</i>

We got seven down
and.

Seven down.

I've got a child victim...
I need rescue.

<i> Breaking news</i>
<i>coming out of aurora, Colorado.</i>

<i>A scene</i>
<i>of a shooting this morning.</i>

<i>A movie theater</i>
<i>where "the dark knight rises"</i>

<i>was being shown.</i>

<i>On July 20, 2012,</i>

<i>James Holmes commits</i>
<i>one of the worse mass shootings</i>

<i>in recent history.</i>

<i>But if the massacre itself</i>
<i>weren't horrific enough,</i>

<i>James's costuming</i>
<i>was an ominous testament</i>

<i>to the allure</i>
<i>of a very specific clown.</i>

<i>Introduce a little anarchy,</i>

<i>upset the established order.</i>

Then everything becomes chaos.

I'm an agent of chaos.

<i> Holmes's embodiment</i>
<i>of the joker,</i>

<i>a villain</i>
<i>who has come to represent</i>

<i>the ultimate destruction</i>
<i>of our civilized world</i>

<i>is no coincidence.</i>

<i>In our never-ending attempts</i>
<i>to sanitize society,</i>

<i>we sometimes reap what we sow.</i>

<i> In a sense,</i>
<i>you can really look at it s</i> as

a possible backlash.

He felt this compulsion
to water the clown down

into this cartoonish,
harmless being,

<i>and maybe underlying traits</i>
<i>of the archetype</i>

<i>just came back with a vengeance.</i>

<i> Holmes's joker-fueled</i>
<i>rampage not only signified</i>

<i>that the clown's transformation</i>
<i>from innocent to evil</i>

<i>was finally complete,</i>
<i>but it also revealed</i>

<i>what was truly lurking</i>
<i>inside of us all.</i>

We think of ourselves as one,
and in fact we're really

kind of a parliament
of personalities.

<i>The killer clown</i>
<i>is one of our personalities,</i>

<i>it's part of us.</i>

And so therefore,
we have to be very careful

not to let the killer clown out
except, in a safe way...

except in a playful way.

See, madness as you know,

is like gravity.

All it takes is a little push.

<i>The babysitter killer,</i>

<i>the hook man,</i>
<i>the Halloween sadist,</i>

<i>the killer clown...</i>

<i>what can we learn</i>
<i>from these urban legends</i>

<i>and from the true crimes</i>
<i>that may have inspired them?</i>

<i>Maybe these monsters,</i>
<i>despite our overwhelming desire</i>

<i>to believe otherwise,</i>
<i>just aren't real.</i>

<i>By presenting false boogeymen,</i>

<i>our urban legends are helping us</i>

<i>to make sense of crimes</i>
<i>too wicked to comprehend.</i>

<i> An urban legend,</i>
<i>even though it can be scary,</i>

<i>it's not nearly as scary</i>
<i>as the actual murderers</i>

that live in the world with us.

<i> But peel back the</i>
<i>layers of any campfire tale,</i>

<i>and you'll understand</i>
<i>the inherent truth</i>

<i>that despite our need</i>
<i>to believe in an evil,</i>

<i>in a darker force,</i>
<i>it just isn't true.</i>

<i>In the end,</i>
<i>the only real boogeyman</i>

<i>is the one that lurks</i>
<i>inside of us all,</i>

<i>waiting for just</i>
<i>the right moment to emerge.</i>

<i>So what's the lesson</i>
<i>behind this cautionary tale?</i>

<i>The warning here is simple...</i>

<i>be afraid, not of the story,</i>

<i>but of the storyteller.</i>
