We would like to look
through the anomaly

at an astronomical object

over the triangle

and see if they seem obscured.

The object I just slewed to
a little while ago

is now no longer
in the database.

Erik, the cattle have scattered
through the entire field.

Something's definitely scared them.

What the hell is that
in the sky?

That thing is big and spherical.

Yes, it is. It's got
a black dot in the center of it.

There's something that
I'd like to get your eyes on.

There. There.
Oh, what was that?

That's the brightest thing
in the sky!

There is a ranch
in Northern Utah.

It is considered the epicenter

of the strangest and most
disturbing phenomena on Earth:

Animal mutilations,

bizarre UFO sightings

and unusual energies that have
proven harmful to humans.

For 20 years,
the federal government

tried to find answers
and failed.

Now a new team
of dedicated scientists,

researchers and experts
has taken over.

They are determined to solve
the mystery and reveal...

...The Secret
of Skinwalker Ranch.

So, Kaleb just came in
after being out on patrol

and mentioned
that it looks like

we have a downed cow
out here in the field, so,

Kaleb, Thomas, myself...

We're gonna go check it out.

Oh, man, she doesn't
look good, does she?

Yeah, she's not
doing well... at all.

Boy, her eyes don't
look good, either.

Yeah, she doesn't look
very healthy at all.

Hey. Oh, you're good.

You're good.

Oh, come on up, girl.

Get up. Come on.

How many years did we go

without any cattle having
any issues whatsoever,

and now we're drilling,

we're doing all kinds
of stuff, and all of a sudden,

two out of three years, we've
got cows that are in bad shape?

How's it going?
Good. How are you, Donavon?

Good.
Good to see you.

Good to see you, too.

Morning, Richard.

Hey, Tommy.
How are you?

Good. How are you?

Oh, doing pretty good.
Good to see you out.

Yeah, good to be out.

So, uh, we got this cow

that's down here
that we called you about.

There's one cow now

that's starting
to separate herself

from the group, and

appears to be struggling.

My first thought is
to always notify the rancher.

These animals don't belong
to us.

512 acres is a lot
of ground to maintain,

and we bring the cows on
to help keep the grass down.

You know, I don't... I don't
know what the deal is with her,

or what her problem is,
but hopefully,

you can look at her
and figure out what's going on.

Well, let's go see
what she's doing.
Okay.

It's not that mysterious

for a cow
to get sick on a ranch,

but there were several
odd coincidences about this cow

that Thomas, Dragon and Kaleb
found acting bizarre

out in the south field.

One... this happened
only a couple nights

after our telescope
and rocket experiment

where two different UAPs
appeared in the sky.

I am getting something
on the 1.6.

Two... those UAPs appeared

just after Erik detected
another dangerous

RF radiation reading
of 1.6 gigahertz,

and the cows got all spooked
and started running around.

Erik, the cows have
pushed in on us.

And three...
This cow is acting strange

in the exact same location

where a cow actually died
two years ago

just as a UAP appeared
in the sky above it.

This herd seems pretty docile.

Do you ever see

aggression out of cows
anywhere other than here?

Well, what seems weird to me

is when you have one cow
out of the whole herd

that starts going mental.

And I've never had that

on our ranch.
Hmm.

Only here?
Only here.

Wow.
Interesting.

That's very interesting.

Just as we have many
scientific instruments,

sensors and cameras
deployed across the ranch,

we also speak
of the animals here

as bio sensors.

And it's natural
for us to wonder

whether there might be something

connected
to our recent experiment.

Well, see, there's, uh...

Yeah, she's starting to move.

Get up, get up.
There. Good deal.

It's weird. It looks like
she's trying to move all...

She's gonna go down, Donavon.

You got to get in front of her.

Wow.

She's down, she's down.
Yeah. - She might be...

Yup. See, now she starts...
Yes.

Getting aggressive right there. Shh. Shh.
Yeah.

Shh.
She's got a gaze on us.

Dad, I got her, I got her.
Get back!

He's on her.
Get back! Get back!

Luca, back.

Come on.

Ah.

Let her... let her lay down.

She's really in distress.
Yeah.

What I think we'll do,
Tommy, is take her home,

and see if she acts
any different at home.

She's totally agitated.

I think there's something going
on. I don't know what it is.

I don't like thinking about it,
I don't want to be around it.

It's a mystery.

Sorry this happened.

We appreciate you coming and
bringing your animals out here.

Hopefully, this doesn't sour you
on the place too much.

Well, we'll see.

After Erik and I
heard about the cow,

we decided it was time
to reach back out

to someone
who we know was not only

a former investigator
on the ranch,

but also had his own experiences
with bizarre cattle incidents...

Retired Army Colonel
John Alexander.

Thanks for coming out. We appreciate it.
Okay.

Colonel Alexander was
a key member

of billionaire
Robert Bigelow's team,

who studied phenomena
on the ranch for two decades,

starting back in 1996.

Hey, guys.
You remember Colonel Alexander?

So, given everything
we've been experiencing

recently at the triangle,

which now seems to be affecting
the cattle, as well,

we were grateful
that he agreed to come back

and share information that
could help our investigation.

So, is this the first time
you've been back to the ranch

since the Bigelow era?

Been a couple decades.

Wow.
Looks a little different.

The topography looks the same.
The rest of it

has kind of, uh...
has been updated quite a bit.

I was a colonel in the Army,

I was in special operations,

and finally, as director
of advanced system concepts.

The second career was
Los Alamos National Laboratory,

where we did all
the non-lethal weapons concepts.

I had just left Los Alamos,
and in mid '95,

Bob Bigelow decided
to create NIDS...

National Institute
for Discovery Science...

And I was the first
NIDS employee.

NIDS was formed for the purpose
of looking at UFOs.

Skinwalker presented that
and so much more.

We would like to see

if you have some insight
from your past here

that might spur us
into some other experiments

that we might like to do.

So, during the time
that you guys were here,

can you, uh,
think of a specific

event that was the most
disturbing or impactful?

Especially something, like, with a cow?

I wouldn't know where
to begin with that one.

Um, when NIDS was created
in mid '95,

Terry Sherman was prepared
to sell the ranch,

and so, Bob Bigelow
made him an offer.

After he s... bought the ranch...
So he stayed on

as the ranch manager?
He-he stayed on

as the ranch manager.

So it was calving season.
Terry went out,

found a newborn,
tag it and weighed it.

Drives across, as you know,
perfectly open field,

finds another newborn, tags it
and weighs it, comes back.

And the mother's going berserk,
and calf one is dead.

Not only is it dead,
but there's about 40 pounds

of stuff is missing.

It's eviscerated,
exsanguinated,

ear had been sliced off.

Hearing the strange details
of this calf

being mutilated in broad
daylight reminds me again

of the cow that died
after we first stimulated UAPs

to appear above the triangle
two years ago.

What in the world?

Tom Winter ton found the cow
right after it died,

and alerted us
to go investigate it.

The meter's just going crazy.

Almost immediately,
we began detecting high readings

of RF radiation
with our TriField meters,

so we got out of there.

What we'll do is go forward
very slowly.

But then, we reviewed
the surveillance footage

that captured the moment
of the cow's death

and saw a UAP
in the sky right above it.

Since that day, we've wondered
if we might have stopped

a mutilation from happening.

But it's also very curious

that both the Bigelow team
and our team

had cows die under very
inexplicable circumstances

right after we first began
investigating phenomena

on Skinwalker Ranch.

It made me wonder
what other similarities

we've both experienced.

What's really interesting is,
a lot of times when we do have

these anomalies, we are
detecting a strange signal

that we can't identify
at 1.6 something gigahertz.

Okay.
And, so,

I guess the question
we would have is,

during the time
that you guys were here,

did you record or see things
that looked like this signal

at 1.6 gigahertz?

Well, as you know, I've dealt

with the UFO phenomena
quite a bit,

and-and that is one
of the perplexing aspects,

is things like
these sort of signals.

And these things occur
in many, many areas,

and why is it that we see things
that shouldn't be there,

and don't see things
that we should see?

Yup.
For instance, we would set up cameras, and say,

"Okay, we're gonna...
If it's happening here,

we're gonna watch
in that location,"

but you get nothing,

and things
would happen off camera.

Sometimes
the most important data

are the ones we can't collect.

The fact that something
is interfering, which is

very often the case here.
Right.

So, the other thing
I wanted to ask you is,

we've heard
about opening portals.

Uh, what can you tell us
about those?

The closest to
what you're asking

is the incident out at...
near the second homestead.

You know,
something moving through

the Russian olives out there,

through the trees.

We were aware of kind of
a slight distortion.

You didn't see a thing; It was
more of distortions moving.

After their investigation ended,

the NIDS team put forth the idea

that a portal connected
to another dimension

causes the phenomena
that happened on the ranch.

I don't know
if that could really explain

what's happened
during our experiments,

but we've seen some crazy stuff
at Homestead Two as well.

Last year,
we used thermal imaging

at night to capture
a circular temperature vortex

that was at least
20 degrees colder

than any of its surroundings.

Oh, whoa.

And when we reviewed
our footage, we saw something

moving erratically
in front of the homestead.

Now, I'm still not ready to say
a portal or a wormhole exists

on Skinwalker Ranch,
but it is amazing

that other researchers

and scientists believe
that it could.

So what I'm taking from this
is that there is a long history

of unusual phenomena
without an identifiable source

in this basin.

And I'm learning that there
were no answers produced

as a result
of the previous research here.

That's kind of surprising.
Right.

Because that burden
that we're bearing today is

that our own conclusions
don't make sense to us yet.

It's been a frustration,
almost become a joke.

Yes, but I think you're
operating under the illusion

that you're in control.

You're not in control.

There's an "it"
that's in control.

Whatever "it" was seemed
to know how we would respond

before the event even occurred.

It was not responding

in a way
that we would anticipate.

And every time
you tried to anticipate,

it would just morph to something
a little bit different.

Like I say, you like that?
Try this.

I'm really interested in how
you arrived at that impression,

that overall assessment
of what was going on here,

from having experiments
not go as you planned

to there being an "it."

When a physical event
had occurred,

something would happen.

Theoretically,
can some of these happen, yes,

but when you look
at it practically,

it just makes no sense at all.

It was when "it" decided

to present us with something
that the events occurred.

We inherited this narrative

that it's dangerous
to dig on the ranch.

My question to you is,

are you aware of any exercises
during the Bigelow era

where they may have
done experiments

that included
digging and watching?

I'm familiar with that.

The digging

was to see if some sort

of phenomena
would manifest itself.

If we can do something
that will cause a response.

And sometimes incidents happen.

While we've got you here,

we could take you around

and show you some places
on the ranch.

You show us where you think things happened.
Well, yeah,

well, one of my areas
of interest is revisiting

where some of these events took place at.
That would be great

for you to tell us that.
That'd be helpful to us.

Yeah, that'd be very helpful.
So, uh,

with that in mind,
I think we should load up

and head out.

This particular area is...
This is the triangle?

Yeah, it's been...
The infamous triangle.

I'll tell you, it's really more

about phenomena in the sky
above the triangle than actually

on the triangle.
Oh, yeah.

Colonel Alexander told us
a lot of different stories

about phenomena they had seen
back in the Bigelow era.

So, what we thought was,
him showing us

where these things happened
might give us some insight

of where we might want
to do some experiments

to reproduce it
and maybe capture some data.

This place look familiar to you, John?
Oh, yes.

The story that sticks with me is

your account
of the portal opening up.

Oh, yes. Well, it was
a little bit farther up.

Back in the NIDS days,
multiple eyewitnesses

have written
about these phenomena.

Maybe there is some connection

with whatever
these phenomena are,

what they've seen in the past,
and what we're seeing today.

It was around this corner
right here

where we had
the radiation spikes.

Uh, near this cistern.

Well, that's interesting because
this is one of the few areas

I have some old pictures from.

Y'all measured for gamma rays
and stuff like that?

Yeah, what...
They used the TriField meters

and whatnot, but, uh...
You know why this is open?

Do you know why that's open?

I don't know why
that's open, either.

I wonder who opened it up.
Uh...

'Cause I don't... Someone's
been here and opened this up.

It's always closed.

It usually is closed
because we don't want anyone

or anything falling in there.

Yeah, somebody's opened this up.

Two years ago, I was exposed
to dangerous levels

of ionizing radiation coming
directly from this cistern

that left burns
on my hand and face.

Ever since then, we've had
radiation sensors placed

all around the ranch
just to be safe.

And seeing the lid off this
cistern is not just curious.

It's concerning.

I don't know why...
That...

It's heavy, too.
It ain't just...

It is.
Yeah.

You got it, Tom?

Why is that open?

Somebody opened it.

I'm just trying
to figure out who.

We need to get
to the bottom of that.

Did y'all have weird stuff
like that happen?

You know, things being
one orientation,

and you come back,
and it's moved?

Yeah, but it's...
The problem was like this...

You notice it after the fact.

So, where do you think
the, uh, portal was?

From... out in the field. Yeah.
Oh, from out there?

Oh, show us...
show us where that is.

Yeah, out in this general area.

And it's sort of moving
through the treetops here.

Again, it was more of
a distortion.

This was early evening.
Our guys were down there,

and it was kind of
a disturbance.

You didn't actually
see a thing.

It was more
of distortions moving.

Just so I'm clear,
it was almost like

the cloaked movement...
Yeah, like something moving

through the treetops.
Okay.

A disturbance...
Mm-hmm.

...in the visual spectrum
as it goes across.

They only were able to see it
through the night vision

cameras? Is that correct?

Yeah.
Okay.

Okay.
Well.

So, why don't we head that way?

Let's go up through here
so we can avoid the water.

Okay, you lead the way, Thomas.

It's a good thing to reach out
to people that have been here

and other research efforts
to understand this place.

This is a strange place.
Weird things happen.

Anybody that has any insight...
That's gonna be useful data.

The caretakers
that were here after,

uh, the Shermans left,
had indicated that

Bigelow's team...
They actually used a bulldozer,

and done some trenches
here in this field.

It was more a disturbance.

The intent was not
to dig, per se. It was just,

we'll screw with things
and see if...

See if you could stimulate it?
Oh, yeah.

To quote Travis,
they were trying

to poke the hornet's nest?

Yeah.
I see.

Do you know,
did they ever feel

like they got a response
from any of that?

Yeah. Well, we just discussed
the one with the portal.

Yeah.
You get something like that...

Sure.
It wasn't like we tried

to orchestrate the response.

It was, do we get a response?

What does that look like?
Okay.

Yeah.
Listening to you talk about it, you know, I...

in the back of my mind I say,

"Well, if Bigelow's team
dug there once,

"I want to go dig
there again and see

if strange things happen."
Right.

We dig again
to see if it's repeatable.

Yup.
And so, do you reckon

that if we were
to come in and dig again,

we would get a response?

Um... don't know.

Where you dig
makes a difference.

Well, we find support
for the idea that when

we do things, we do see what
we interpret as a response.

Right.
And so, that's what we're weighing out right now.

How do we proceed with that?

Well, while we've been
standing here talking,

I've been scanning
over this field.

Mm-hmm.
You know, for it being a level

field, I see a pretty good
bulldozer-width indentation

right here
between these two trees.

Oh, yeah.
I think

that that would be a great spot
to come in and dig again.

Oh, that would be
a real good idea.

Then see what happens with the front.
Yeah.

Well, John, thank you so much
for coming out here.

I know we're losing daylight, so
we want to get you back safely,

so, if we pile in and head out?
Whenever you're ready, so...

Yeah, let's head back.
Okay, thank you. - Yeah.

Colonel Alexander

and the previous team
witnessed so many

stunning events that really

laid the foundation
for the research

that we took forward
to present day.

The information and insight that
he had shared with the team

helped shape the nature
of our investigation.

Well, we all got quite a bit
on our plates.

After Colonel
John Alexander told us

that the NIDS team dug
near Homestead Two,

and stimulated
what they believed

to be portal activity
on the ranch,

Thomas rented
an industrial-sized bulldozer

so we could dig
in that exact same area

to see what might happen.

Oh, here he comes.

What's up, Thomas?
How was... how was

your sports car ride over here?

Rough.
Yeah, I'll bet.

I'll bet it was.

So I'm thinking we just go down,
what, four or five feet?

That makes sense. The height of
the blade or something, right?

Or until we hit water, I guess.
Yeah, yeah.

I don't want to bury that.

So you maybe take
about a-a foot off first,

and we can look at it, and then,
take another couple of feet.

Oh, yeah.
Then maybe get down to where...

Maybe something like that?
Yeah, that sounds good.

Well, it goes without saying,

we need to just keep an eye
on ourselves.

If you start feeling
anything funny,

obviously,
let somebody know, because

when you dig,
bad stuff actually does happens.

Yeah, so if you guys see

anything start to elevate, let me know...
Yeah.

And I'm gonna shut her down.
I'm gonna sit here and watch.

I'm gonna sit here
and watch constantly

while you're doing it.
I'm not gonna let you

be out here digging
without this... without one us

being out here with a Geiger counter.
Yeah.

Yeah. What are you reading?
Right now,

we're at normal background.

12. Yeah.
12 micro?

As a precaution
for this experiment, Erik had

the spectrum analyzer
scanning the area

for the 1.6 gigahertz RF signal,

and we both also had
Geiger counter devices

to look out for harmful spikes
in gamma radiation.

When we dug last year
in the south field

near where the cow died,

we detected gamma rays
three times the normal level.

All right, I think, uh...
I think we got it covered.

Thomas, you ready to dig?
Yeah, I'm ready to dig.

Rolling this D8 dozer across...
This is definitely

the largest bulldozer that has
ever been on Skinwalker Ranch.

Nothing unusual.

After seeing

some of the data
that we've received

after digging other holes
on the ranch,

it'll be interesting
to see what happens.

That looks like that may be a
little harder to dig, don't it?

It does.

Hey, Dragon, Erik,
y'all seeing anything?

Yeah. Me, either.

Ugh. That's not good.

We really haven't

even gotten that deep down
in the soil

when the bulldozer
just bogs down and dies.

This big of a dozer should be
able to handle this very easily.

It's just another event
in a long list of experiments

that haven't gone the way
that we planned.

So, guys, I didn't shut it off.
It bogged down, and it-it died.

But, uh, it's telling me
it's got a dead battery.

Didn't they just put
two new ones in it?

Like, an hour ago.
Yeah.

I got to tell you,

I wish
I had a voltmeter out here.

So why don't we run back

and get one just to see? - Yeah.
Yeah.

It doesn't look
like that's going anywhere.

It was like, here we go again.

We just get started digging
to stimulate a ranch response,

and the fully-charged battery
in the bulldozer dies.

I'm gonna keep fidgeting
around with this.

Yeah, yeah. All right.
Maybe it'll...

Okay.

Man, were you expecting that?
No.

Was that the ranch responding?
I don't know.

So while Erik
and Dragon went back

to the command center
to get his voltmeter,

and also
to process the collected data

from gamma ray detector,

the rest of us hung back

just in case something even
more strange would happen next.

Hey, Bryant,

I want you to see this.

We've got a couple flavors of
strangeness going here, Bryant.

Look! What the actual hell is this?
What?

While the guys were trying
to fix the bulldozer,

I saw a massive spike
in radiation

in our gamma ray detectors
stationed near Homestead Two

in the area
where they were digging.

It could be very dangerous
for anyone in that location.

This is not seven!
Is that 3400?

It's almost 3500.

These are very inexplicable
spikes,

as if something artificial
could be generating them.

You got to get those people out of there.
Okay.

That... that's...

What's wrong?

Erik pulled the data.
There was a spike at 3400.

3400?
3400.

Everybody out of here now!
Everybody out.

Erik just picked up a gamma ray
source that was 3400

micro roentgen per hour.

That's a significant dose.

That's enough dose ray
that it could be dangerous.

In terms of gamma rays,

that's almost 300 times
what would be normal and safe.

You guys, come on.

We had to immediately
evacuate the area

and go see if we could get to
the bottom of what's going on.

Erik was like,
"Go get 'em out of there."

What's going on, Erik?

Travis, you got to see this.

You are not going to like it.

I want you to see...
This is what we just logged

in that field between Homestead
Two and Homestead Three.

Okay, now, look.
Holy...

Look what we got.
Yeah.

And I want you to see...
Look at that.

It's-it's almost
3,500 micro roentgens per hour.

Now get this. You've got other
strange behavior here that...

Uh-oh. Zeroes. Yeah.
Zeroes.

Something has interfered...
Oh.

...with the data collection
process.

There's three hours missing here.
It's gone.

It's gone.

What's really weird is,

there was a big spike
in the gamma rays,

and then, there was
a complete hole in the data,

meaning the meter said
zero radiation.

A gamma ray detector
can't do that.

Even if you put it
in a lead box,

it's still gonna give you some
background reading, not zero.

Here's the thing.
So, either we're getting

these horrible gamma rays

at this level... Okay.
Yeah.

...or something's hacking us.

Either one isn't good, but

we got to treat it
like it's the gamma rays

'cause that's the most dangerous
right now.

If this is saying,
"Don't dig here,"

then that's the big,
blinky sign that says,

we need to dig right there.

Right.
And that's what I've said from day one.

And I guess...
this only reinforces that.

My question in response is,

what is the smartest way
to follow up,

and what is the safest way
to follow up?

Well, the smartest,
safest way, the first thing

we got to do is,
we need to determine

what this is, right?
Mm-hmm.

If something was to happen

to any of us,
I mean, this is bad stuff.

Now that the radiation levels
are back

to normal, I think
we should wait until tonight,

and go back out there to see
what else we can stimulate.

We'll be careful
like Dragon wants,

monitoring the whole time
with Geiger counters

and the spectrum analyzer,

but we need
to keep poking this nest

to see what we can reveal
about Skinwalker Ranch.

To be honest, I'm not worried
about going back out there,

if you're there monitoring.

All right, great.

Thanks, Erik.

Yeah, right in here
in all these damn weeds.

We waited until nightfall

to go back out
near Homestead Two

to see if we could stimulate
more phenomena to appear

that might prove or disprove

Colonel Alexander
and NIDS' theory

that a portal might exist
on Skinwalker Ranch.

All right, I want to get where
I can see the bulldozer.

Well, I think we can see it...

Yeah, it's right there.
Yeah, there it is.

Let's get our stuff set up.

Now, the plan was
to set up a safe distance

from the dead bulldozer

and use what's become
our tried-and-true method

for stimulating phenomena.

Watch your hand.

Launching a rocket.

We are ready to launch!

We also set up a spectrum
analyzer to look out

for any strange RF energy.

Okay, so this is up and running.

And we put a Geiger counter
right next

to the stalled bulldozer

to check for any more
dangerous gamma rays.

That's really, really low.
Good. That makes me happy.

We also brought out

a night vision
monocular scope so that

we could safely observe
from a distance

if anything weird happened
over there.

At this stage
in the investigation,

safety was still paramount,
as always.

Going hot!

But we all agree that we need

to be aggressive
in order to get some answers.

Thomas, you ready?
Yeah, whenever you are.

All right, here we go. Five,

four, three,

two,

one.

Oh, got the chute.
We got the chute!

It's coming down
right over here.

Coming down fast.

The chute hasn't opened.

Boom!

Now, Kaleb, you got it?

Oh, yeah, it landed
right in a tree.

I'm looking for any UAPs.

I don't see nothing.

While Kaleb's getting that,
I'm gonna go over here and check

the instruments and stuff.

He may need some help.
I don't know.

Kaleb, you need help?

I got it.

I can't figure out why
the chute didn't open, though.

Erik, are you doing
something at 1.6?

I'm not broadcasting.

What are you seeing?

A signal?

1.60000...

When the chute failed to open,

and the rocket crashed down
near the homestead,

I didn't want to jump
to conclusions,

but then, right on cue,

Erik's spectrum analyzer
registered that freaky,

1.6 gigahertz energy level
that has coincided

with almost every phenomenon
we've witnessed out here.

You want me sweeping around? It's...
Yeah, yeah, I do.

Something was starting
to happen.

Oh, whoa, whoa! Right there.

The one signal went away.

Go back the other way.

Well, it's coming back. Oh,
right there, right there. Stop.

So, it's very directional?
Yes.

That's southwest.

That's right
where the rocket just went.

Yeah.

Are you kidding me?

Thomas's thought
to turn the antenna

connected
to the spectrum analyzer

was brilliant
because it clearly showed us

that the 1.6 gigahertz signal

was coming from
the same direction in the sky

that the rocket
had just flown through.

The question was,
what the hell was it?

Let me... let me go up
and down with it.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.

Suddenly, two signals
right when you did that.

So, look, we've got three peaks.

That means nothing to me.

Well, it doesn't mean a lot
to us except,

usually,
if it's a communication signal,

you'll see one big one
in the middle

and then, two smaller ones
on the side.

At equal distances.
And that's kind of

what we're seeing,

but this one's coming
and going, which is odd.

Want to try and listen to it?
Yeah.

It's chirping in frequency.

That's a communication signal
or something.

That's...
So all that disappears

when you go off down here?
Yeah, yeah.

I mean, it's got
to be right there, and...

I mean, it's got to...
It's a small, a very small cone.

That's interesting.

So, if it were
a deep sky object,

in 15 minutes, it'd be gone.
Mm-hmm.

Because of the rotation
of the Earth.

From my experience
as a rocket scientist,

this sound frequency was

like the kind of communication
signal you would get

from a satellite
orbiting the Earth,

or even farther out in space.

Listen to that!

But the signal was coming
from the area

above the ranch
where we shot the rocket,

and it was pointed directly
at Homestead Two.

So, what would be broadcasting
a communication signal

like that, and where
could it be coming from?

Okay, so you say it's pointed

to where we just
shot the rocket.

So, what? That's our message,

and this is the message
coming back?

I mean, I know that's a stretch,
but , after everything

that's gone down today,
I have no clue.

That's not a...
I don't know.

I swear that sounds
like a communication signal.

It stopped.

I don't know what elsep
to say about it. I mean,

everything's been quiet,
except for that thing.

But, yeah, the Geiger counter
hadn't had a single

thing over, like,
15 or 16 all night.

Good.
I know.

Good.
Right?

Uh, confusing, but good.

We've had a hell of a day.

That mysterious 1.6 gigahertz

frequency sound
suddenly stopped.

Now, I'm not sure, but to me,
it sounded like some sort

of communication signal.

It's crazy to think about,
but we need to try

and figure out what
in the heck it could be

and why we're receiving it.

All right, well,
let's-let's load up.

All right.
Okay.

What's going on, Erik?

Well, I'm looking through some footage.
Yeah?

Yeah, I've got something
to show you.

The day after
our night experiment

at Homestead Two, Erik called
us in to review something

in his surveillance footage

that got him both excited
and a little freaked out.

You know, we've got
all these new cameras out

at the homesteads,
so, you know,

I-I get plenty
of critter activity.

We have a lot deer,
we have a lot of...

At night, we have birds

and bats, especially.

But between all of that,

once in a while, we get some
things that just don't fit in.

You know? You know what it looks
like when you've got a,

you know, moth, or a, you know,
some kind of insect, or

a piece of debris flying
across your field of view.

But I've got something here
that doesn't fit in.

Really?
Yeah.

It happened just last night
after our experiment.

I'm gonna play this real time.

So, what camera are we looking
at specifically here?

This is out
at the Carriage House.

Now, Car... That's the thing
across the road

from Homestead Two, right?
Yeah.

So, looking back toward
Homestead Two? It's that one?

Yeah.
Okay, so across the canal.

Yeah.

What on Earth is that?

What the hell is that?

Okay, so,
let's play this through,

and I really want your thoughts
on what this might be.

Oh, it's behind the tree,
so it's far enough away.

Right.

Play that again.
Sure.

You can see
the other particles around.

So, it's leaving a trail.

Go back, Erik. Go back...
Sure.

About, um...
Sure. Yeah, point out the trail.

Is that camera lag?

It could be.
Stop right there.

Uh-huh.

You can even see the trail
behind it.

Now let it... watch it go.

It leaves a trail
behind it as it goes.

All right, stop. You see it?
Sure.

You see it back there?

Now, what's the frame rate
of this camera?

Um, these are set,
I believe, to 24. I...

Well, that's not moving much faster than that.
No.

So it shouldn't be causing
frame delay.

I mean, there's frame rate...
There's a black line

through the center
of this thing.

Interesting.
If you look,

there's a line going
right through the center of it.

And it's like this.

So, let it play
and see if it continues.

Okay. Yeah.

Yeah, it stays through it.

Let it keep going.
Okay.

So it's not a bug
inside the field of view

because it goes
behind this tree, right?

Well, it's not...
Look at the bugs, Travis.

You can see the bugs zooming by.
Yeah.

This thing looks like a balloon

floating around on the wind.
Yeah, and then it goes

behind the tree over here.

Yeah, but the movement is ver...
Yeah, that one.

...is very organic, I would say.

It's-it's irregular,
it's not even just

smoothly moving
through the scene.

Well, the interesting thing
is, you look at the grass

and the trees.

I don't see really
any wind, you know?

Good point.
And so you see it, it drifts over to the right with

no wind going that direction,
and then it drifts and

just slowly... Like I said,
it almost looks like

a balloon just floating around.

That's not being
affected by the same forces

that are
carrying the rest of it.

It's not a balloon,
because a balloon would have

been more stochastically,
nautically moving about.

And that looks like
it's moving with intent.

Comes along, decides
it doesn't want to be here,

and it decides to go off
this way.

This is unique.

I...
You know, and it's...

I don't think
I've seen anything...

You've never shown me
anything close to that.

Well, it goes in front
of those trees and behind

that tree, so that tells us
it's at least 30 feet away.

So it's about
the size of a volleyball.

Think of it this way.
In one night, one span there,

we see a strange
communication beam,

and then we see this thing.

Is there a connection?

What's particularly
bizarre about this phenomenon

is it happened just
after our rocket experiment

at Homestead Two

when we heard
that really strange

1.6 gigahertz signal.
It all looks to be connected.

I just don't know how
or why yet.

In the beginning,
it almost looks like it changes

shape a little bit to me.

Is it more, though, that,

looking at the end
would be a circle,

but then as it turns,
a cigar shape,

because you're
getting more of a 3D...

Just like this, right?
If you're looking at this

end on, you think it's a circle, right?
Sure.

If you look at it like this,
it's like a line or something,

you know, cigar-shaped.

I'll tell you
what it reminds me of.

The Tic Tac, the UAP video.

The UAP that appeared in

the Tic Tac video
that was recorded by

the USS Nimitz group in 2004

appeared to be cigar-shaped
when viewed from certain angles.

But it was reported to look more
spherical by the Navy pilots

when it flew
straight towards them.

Do any of those objects move
around so organically, like...

As we see here?
Yes, and they amorphously

change shape, depending
on the direction they turn.

So, we've measured a signal
many times when we've seen

phenomena occur specifically
around 1.6 gigahertz.

We're seeing whatever this
thing is,

and interestedly enough,

at the same instant, we see
this signal at 1.6 gigahertz.

It's pretty bizarre.

It's crazy is what it is.

I don't know what to say
of this,

but I would say you've captured
a UAP on camera here, Erik,

and we don't know what it is.

Well, this is just
one more case of

strange activity
out at the homesteads.

You know, Homestead Two is
a place where we see

a lot of this stuff.

So, I'm not going
to be satisfied

until I've spent some time doing

some image processing on this.
Sure.

And I'll come back
to you guys and

let you know if I find anything.

All right. Thanks, guys.
Good job, Erik.

Our fascination,
our speculation about the ranch

phenomenon and about
how the ranch fits into

the larger picture has
only been elevated.

We realize we're
not dealing with a simple

problem set,
but one that is very complex.

All of this new data
that we have tells us there are

some really weird anomalies.

We don't know
what's causing that.

There's so much data.

What is the next
level of experimentation

that we need to do
to determine what this is?

You can't just go dig everywhere
under the ranch to find this.

We're gonna have to
find a better way to look deeper

under the surface to
figure out what's causing that.

The presence
of a signal or a frequency

that seems to attend
the events and the activities

on the property may be
our greatest discovery yet.

I had always hoped
that these activities would lead

to our ability
to hopefully communicate

with the entities
involved with the ranch.

Now, I believe
what we may be seeing is

communication back to us

in ways that we had
not anticipated

here at Skinwalker Ranch.

It looks like
something's collapsed here.

That tells me
that was done to hide something.

There was an area
I found on this mesa slope,

and it lead to this open cave.

I'm pretty sure this is it.

What were they hiding
in that mesa?

Popping smoke. Look, look,
it's getting sucked in.

You guys really
stirred the old hornet's nest.

Look, they're movin'.
I've never seen this many

mysterious lights in the sky.
