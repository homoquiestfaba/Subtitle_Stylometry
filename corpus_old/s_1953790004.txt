Oceanic flight 815

Crashed in the south pacific
on september 22, 2004

We all gonna be okay,
do you understand me?

48 people survived
on an forgotten island

with no hope for rescue

we think they would gone by now

and they soon learned

this is our island

they were not alone

the only reason you live on it

is because we let you

What if everything

That happened here
Happened for a reason?

I'm one of the survivors
Of flight 815.

No!
After 108 days...
jin!

Six people found rescue.

So we can go off the island?

But the friends
They left behind...

he wants us To move the island.

Vanished.

Where's the island?!

This is the story
Of the six who came home...

ladies and gentlemen,
The survivors of oceanic 8-1-5.

Their experience
as it unfolded...

you're being watched.

And how they came
To realize...

we made a mistake.

That destiny was calling.

Some very bad things happened.

I think it wants us
To come back.

And everything
That they lived for...

we're going
On vacation, baby.

Loved for...

how do you know he's alive?!

Fought for...
why would they want
To murder her?

And died for...

he's dead. It's over!

Hung in the balance...

somebody knows we're lying.

And beckoned them...
we never should've
Left that island.

To return.

Lost
the story of the oceanic 6

Are we really going home?

Yeah, we're really going home.

The survivors
Of oceanic flight 815

Believed they'd finally Found rescue 

when a freighter Transporting A team
of scientists Arrived near the island.

But rescue was not
The primary mission.

This is charles widmore,

The man whose boat
Is parked offshore.

What does he want?

Charles widmore was
A mysterious and powerful man

And the nemesis Of benjamin linus,
The leader of the others.

Widmore had been trying To
locate the island for years,

And he staged The recovery of flight 815
To keep anyone else From finding the island.

Get your ass out here
Right now.

Another team From
the freighter arrived...

with orders to capture ben.

I'm not coming out
Of this house.

And in the process,

Ben's daughter alex
Became a casualty.

So if you want to kill her,
Go ahead and do it.

So the survivors made a deal.

What was the arrangement?

They, uh, help us free you,

And we let 'em off the island.

Fair enough.

The helicopter is yours.

You have a safe journey back.

So we can go off the island?

That's it?

That's it.

But john locke Believed
their destiny Was on the island.

If you have to go, 

then you have To lie
about everything.

It's the only way
To protect it.

It's an island, john.

No one needs to protect it.

It's not an island.

It's a place
Where miracles happen.

Let's go, freckles.

I've seen enough of this rock.

Let's go for a ride!

Jack, kate, sawyer And their friends
Left for the freighter By chopper,

As the science team
Took others by boat.

But the chopper
Was leaking fuel...

hey.
So sawyer took action.

???

Why are you telling me this?

Just do it, freckles.

Sawyer!

Sawyer helped his friends And
made his way Back to the island,

Where locke assumed His new role
As leader of the others.

Hello, john. Welcome home.

But with the freighter
Still offshore,

Ben went deep below The orchid
station To move the island

So charles widmore Could
never find it again.

There it is! The boat!
I see it!

The chopper Reached
the freighter,

Only to find that it was
Rigged with explosives.

wait!

It's jin!
wait for me!

Turn around!
We can't do it!

Jin!

What are you Doing here?

Decided to take a dip.

What you celebratin'?

I'm not celebrating.

Is that our boat?

It was.

With the freighter destroyed,
The chopper had no choice 

But to return to the island.

Yeah, what is that?

But the island was gone.

That's it, people!
We're out of fuel!

I can't believe he did it.

He moved the island.

No, he didn't.

You got another explanation,
Man, i'd love to hear it.

There's a boat out there!

Hey!

We're gonna have to lie.

Lie about what?

Our plane was discovered
On the bottom of the ocean.

Well, someone put it there--

Someone who wants everyone
To think that we're dead.

So what do you think's
gonna Happen to us 

when we tell them That
that wasn't our plane?

What do you think's gonna happen
To the people That we left behind?

Just let me do the talking.

Throw them a rope!

Penny?

Penny widmore Was
desmond's long-Lost love,

And she'd been searching
For him for over three years.

I love you, penny,

And i'll never
Leave you again.

Onboard penny's boat,

Jack planned the next move,

While kate focused on aaron,
The son of claire,

An oceanic survivor Who
went missing on the island.

I think we should
say He's mine.

After everyone we've lost--

Michael, jin and sawyer...

i can't lose him, too.

Sawyer's not dead.

But he's gone.

Kate...

tomorrow morning, i'm gonna have
To convince everyone to lie.

Are you with me?

I have always been with you.

Well, are we all
Okay with this? 

Kate?
Yeah.

Sun?

I don't think
We should lie, dude.

I mean, the island disappeared.
We all saw it. It's gone. Bloop!

You think anyone's
Gonna believe that?

We need to protect the people
That we left behind, hurley.

I don't want to spend The
rest of my life lying. Do you?

No, but 

i don't believe
We have a better choic

And so it began.

Jack and his fellow survivors
Said good-Bye To penny and desmond, 

and began Their
long journey home.

News of their miraculous
rescue Spread quickly,

And before they made their way
Back to civilization,

They'd become Instant celebrities.

There's a lot of press
That want to speak to you.

They're referring to you
As the oceanic six.

The oceanic six
Were finally home,

A moment they never
dreamed Would arri.

But the life That awaited them

Was not What they'd hoped for.

And with the world waiting
To hear their story,

The lie was about to begin.

It happened really fast.

I remember the impact,

The plane fiing up with water.

A group of us got To
the emergency door, and, um,

Got out before it went down.

Given The amazing circumstances
Surrounding the survival Of you six,

It is possible there are any
Other survivors from the crash

Yet to be discovered?

No. Absolutely not.

Mom?

Hello?

The survivors Tried
to adjust to a new life,

And for hurley, It seemed the island
had Followed him all the way home.

Surprise!

Interesting choice of theme.

Yeah, mom really doesn't
Get it, dude.

It was clear That family and friends
Could not begin to understand

What the survivors
Had been through...

hurley grew troubled...
turn around!

When he began having encounters With
oceanic survivors Who died on the island.

Help! Help!

What the hell
Is wrong with you?

Are you trying to get tossed
Into the nuthouse?

Because if that's What you want, I can
make that happen Right now, my friend.

You can? 

Thank you!

But it was becoming clear...

jack!

The decision to lie
Would always haunt them.

I don't think we did
The right thing, jack.

I think it wants us
To come back.

Hurley--
And it's gonna do
Everything it can--

We're never going back!

Never say never, dude.

The events of the rescue had
An even greater impact on sun.

She was unable to move past
Jin's presumed death

And took out her pain
On her father.

??? two people are responsble
for his death.

you are one of them.

Without jin, The birth of
her daughter Was bittersweet.

i miss you so much.

But sun's grief

Soon turned to vengeance.

Excuse me. Mr. Widmore?

I'm sun kwon.

You mentioned
that you and i Had... 

common interests.

Why don't you tell me
Exactly what they might be?

To kill benjamin linus.

The oceanic six Were not the
only people To leave the island.

After rning the wheel, Benjamin linus
was transported To the tunisian desert,

10 months in the future,

And it wasn't long Before ben made
contact With the oceanic six.

I just want To bury
my wife in peace.

Mr. Jarrah,

There'a woman outside.
She says she knows you,

But she wasn't on the list
Of family members.

Nadia?

After the rescue, Sayid was
reunited With his long-Lost love.

But their reunion
Would be short-Lived.

She had been run down
by a car In los angeles,

And ben claimed he had proof
That widmore was responsible.

Why would these people
Want to murder her?

I don't know,
But they did.

And so an alliance was born.

Sayid became
an assassin For ben,

Exacting ben's vengeance 
from Nadia's death???

Who is next?

Good morning. 

Is this your First time
in the seychelles?

Sayid went on killing...

until there was no one left.

You've taken care Of everyone
who posed A threat to your friends.

It's been a pleasure
Working with you, sayid.

So that's it?

What do i do now?

I suppose you should
Go live your life.

You're free, sayid.

Shortly after the rescue,

Kate fulfilled the promise...
she made to sawyer On the chopper.

Hey, cassidy.

Oh, my god!
I saw you on the news.

What are you doing here?

Sawyer sent me.

Kate knew cassidy
Before the crash,

But neither were aware
They shared another connection.

What a coward.

He was trying
To do the right thing.

He was trying
To get away from you.

I told him
He had a daughter.

He never so much as lifted
A finger to try to call her.

So now i'm supposed
To think he's a hero

Because he told you
To come here and help us?

Hell, i bet this money's
Not even his, is it?

My father Couldn't
stand eulogies.

"The only good thing About a wake
Is the free booze," he'd say.

For jack, Coming home
provided him The opportunity

To say good-Bye to his father
Christian, who died in sydney.

I loved you. I miss you.

But a visitor from australia
Came to the service

With shocking news for jack.

My father didn't have
A daughter.

Yes, he did.

She was on your plane, Too.

Her name was claire.

Claire's mother was unaware
That aaron was her grandson.

But jack and kate
Were left stunned.

But when kate was tried For the
murder Of her abusive father...

the defense calls
Dr. Jack shephard

To the witness stand.

Jack was there for her.

I only have
one question For you.

Do you love the defendant?

No. 

Not anymore.

The charges against kate
Were dropped.

Hey. I just wanted to tell you
That what i said in there...

i didn't mean it.

"'And yesterday, Things
went on just as usual.'"

Jack moved in
With kate and aaron.

It seemed that all
were happy-- A family.

I'm so glad
That you're here.

Me, too.

Do you really think

That i'm good at this?

Yeah.

You're good at this.

Will you marry me?

Of course i will. Yes.

Kate was happy
To begin a new life.

He's refusing to take his meds,
And he's stopped sleeping.

But hurley's encounters
With dead friends continued,

And one gave him a message
To pass on to jack.

You're not supposed
To raise him, jack.

Do you think
he means aaron?

Take your meds, hurley.

Just take 'em.

Hey, jack?

Charlie said someone's
Gonna be visiting you, too.

Soon.

Jack slowly began
To lose control...

jack?

And for good reason--

He saw his dead father.

Jack began drinking
And taking pills.

And to make matters worse...

i gotta go. Jack's home.

He stopped trusting kate.

Why won't you tell me?

Because he wouldn't
Want me to.

The promise she made to sawyer
Was coming between them

And ultimately brought
Their relationship to an end.

I'm the one who saved you.

You can't do this. All right? 

'Cause i can't have You
like this around my son.

You're not even
Related to him!

What was this thing
Before you guys blew it up?

A dharma station.

For what?

There was a man named
desmond Living down in it.

He was pushing a button every
108 minutes to save the world.

Really?
Really.

The survivors left behind
On the island...

son of a...

found themselves In an
extraordinary situation.

Bitch.

When ben turned the wheel Below
the orchid station To move the island,

It caused
A serious side effect.

Oh, no!

The oceanic survivors And
the scientists From the freighter

Began flashing through time.

Whatever ben linus did,
I think dislodged us.

Dislodged us from what?

Time.

They flashed to numerous
Time periods on the island

And met the others
In the 1950s.

Your name is widmore?

Charles widmore?

What's it to you?

Charlotte?
But the flashes...

charlotte!

Charlotte!
Were slowly killing them.

Daniel faraday Knew
the situation was serious.

Please let this work.

But he had an idea
How he might find help.

Oh! Oh! Whoa. Whoa.

Do i know you?

Desmond, my name is
Daniel faraday.

I need you to go back
To oxford.

I need you to go there
and find My mother. 

Her name is--

Desmond?

We're leavin'.

Leaving to go where?

Oxford.

Desmond's search
For faraday's mother

Uncovered clues that led him Directly
to a confrontation With charles widmore.

I need to know where i can
Find daniel faraday's mother.

Haven't seen or heard from
My daughter for three years.

Just answer me this--

Is she safe?

Where's faraday's mother?

She's in los angeles.

But on the island,
The flashes continued.

What's going on?!

Turn around slowly.

Jin?
Sawyer?

Jin!

Jin survived The
freighter explosion

And had been flashing
Through time as well.

Where is sun?

Hey, john.

Richard Alpert found locke 

And told him the only way
To stop the flashes

Was to bring back those
Who'd left the island.

How am i supposed
To do that?

You're gonna
Have to die, john.

We have to go Back
to the orchid.

Excuse me?

That's where all this started.
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

Locke returned to the location
Of the orchid station.

Aah!

Aah!

Hello, john.

What are you doing down here?

I'm here to help you
The rest of the way.

And he turned the same
wheel That ben turned.

Say hello to my son.

In the process,
The time flashes stopped.

I think it's over.
I think john did it.

Now what?

Now we wait for him
To come back.

But sawyer and his group were
Left stranded on the island

In 1974,

And they had no choice
But to join The dharma initiative.

Locke was transported Three years
into the future... to the tunisian desert,

Where he was soon found By men
working For charles widmore.

I met you when i was 17.

How long has it been for you
Since we first met?

Four days.

That's incredible.

Widmore wanted
To find the island,

So he helped locke
In any way he could.

The folder contains
Your people's whereabouts--

Everyone that was
On the island that left.

Mira. Tienes un visitante.

But locke's task Would
prove to be difficult.

I know how it sounds, sayid,
But you have to trust me.

I'm not going back.

Hello, hugo.

Hey, susie, Am i talking to
a dude In a wheelchair right now?

Yep.

Whoa, dude!

I need you to come back
To the island with me.

What?
And not just you,
But everybody who left.

No, i'm not going
Anywhere with you!

Kate, i don't think
You understand--

No, you made yourself
Perfectly clear,

And the answer is no.

Locke grew discouraged,

But his situation
Soon became dangerous.

This turn of fate Gave locke
another chance To prove his case.

What are you doing here?

We have to go back.

Of course we do.

Jack, the people i left
behind Need our help.

We're supposed to go back.

Because it's our destiny.

How many times are you gonna
Say that to me, john?

Good-Bye, john.

Your father says hello.

What?
The man who told me how
To bring you all back--

He said to tell His son hello.

He said his name
Was christian.

My father is dead.

He didn't look dead to me.

You leave me alone,

And you leave
The rest of 'em alone!

Locke had failed,

And for him,
There was only one option.

Wait, please. John, stop!

What-- What are you doing here?
John, just calm down.

What do you want from me?
Please, let me help.

Answer the question!
I'm trying to protect you!

No! Widmore came to me.

He saved me.
No, john, he used you.

Charles widmore is the reason
I moved the island--

To keep him away
So that you could lead.

I can't lead anyone.
I couldn't get any of them.

I couldn't get a single one
Of them to come back with me.

Jack booked a ticket.
What?

A plane ticket from los angeles
To sydney-- Tonight.

Whatever you said to him,
John, it worked.

And if you got jack,

You can get The rest of them.

I know we can do this, John.

You haven't even Been to sun yet.
Let's start with her.

I promised jin that
I wouldn't bring her back.

Jin is alive?

He wanted me to tell her that
His body washed up on the beach.

He gave me his wedding ring To prove it.

All right.

I don't know Where we go from there,
But we'll Figure something out.

I know where we go.

There's a woman Here
in los angeles-- Eloise hawking.

Eloise hawking?
Are you sure?

Yeah, why?
Do you know her?

Yes, john.
I know her.

Aah!

I'll miss you, john.
I really will.

Jack began taking frequent
Trips across the pacific...

excuse me. Can i get Another
one of those, please?

How about A newspaper instead?

And during one flight home,

He learned that locke was dead.

For the first time, Jack reazed that
he and locke Need one another...

and their ultimate destiny
Was on the island.

Hello?
It's me.

I just need to see you.

Why did you call me, jack?

Been flying a lot.

Why?

Because i want it
To crash, kate.

I actually close my eyes,

And i pray
That i can get back.

I have to go.

We were not supposed To leave.

Yes, we were.

Good-Bye, jack.

We have to go back, kate.

"We have to go back"?

I spent the last three years

Trying to forget All of the horrible things
That happened On the day that we left.

How dare you ask
me to go back?

But jack wouldn't let go,

And he soon found
An unlikely ally.

Heo, jack.

Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you.

Did he tell you that
i was off the island?

Yes, he did.

He told me...

that after I left the island,

Some very bad things Happened,

And he said that
I had to come back.

I'm here to tell you That the island
Won't let you come alone.

All of you have to go back.

We're gonna have
To bring him, too.

Sayid had no intention
Of returning to the island.

But with locke dead, He was serious
about Protecting his friends.

I want you to come with me.
We're not going back, are we?

No.

Just somewhere safe.
Wait here.

Hey, he's got a gun!
Come on! Get out of here!

I thought it was supposed
To be a safe house.

Jack found new purpose

And joined ben To convince
his friends To return to the island.

Okay, let's go get 'em.

Police have now identified Hugo reyes...

but their task Had
become more difficult.

...member of The infamous oceanic six.

Looks like we have
A change of plan.

Jack brought sayid To the hospital
And was able to revive him.

All right. Sayid, you've been attacked.

Where is hurley?

At his parents' house.

Hello, hugo.
Aah!

Get away from me.
Hugo, I know you're in trouble.

I have a car Waiting
fous out back.

No way, dude.
We all want the same thing--

To go back to the island.

If you come with me,
You won't ever Have to lie again.

Let me help you.
Never, dude.

Hey, you got me!

That's right! You got me!
That's right!

I killed 'em.
I killed 'em all.

Just get me away from here.

Ben's plan was in jeopardy.

Hello. Who's there?

But kate's problems
Were just beginning.

You have to go back.

Don't move.

Don't you touch my son!

Claire?

You can't bring him back, Kate.

Don't you dare
Bring him back!

And her fears...

were soon valited.

Miss austen? We're here to
get A blood sample from you

And one from your son aaron.

Why?

To determine your relationship
To the child.

Please, may we come in?
Get off my property.

If you won't comply,

Then i'm going to have to
come back with the sheriff.

Then come back
With the sheriff.

The possibility of losing aaron
had become a reality for kate.

And as she set out To find answers,
Jack was there to help.

Somebody wants aaron.

What?

There's a lawyer in there.

His clients--
They know we're lying,

And they're gonna Take him away.

Look, i gotta go, all right?
Get in or don't.

The path led them To a motel room
Occupied by claire's mother...

oh, my god.

Who was presumably in l.A.
To take her grandson Away from kate.

So jack made an appeal.

Ms. Littleton,

i understand that You
feel the need to do this.

But i need you to know

That everything that
Kate and i have done,

It was for aaron.

Who's aaron?

It was clear That claire's
mother Was not after aaron.

But that night,
Kate would learn who was. 

Hello, kate. It's okay .

He's with me.
He's with you?

He's here to help us, To help
everyone That we left behind.

It's him-- He's the one
Who's trying to take aaron.

No, you-- You don't understand.
No, jack, she's right.

Sun was ready

To exact the revenge She
long sought For jin's death.

Who the hell Do
you think you are?

Why don't you leave me
And my son alone?

Because he's Not your son, kate.

Move away, kate.
Sun, what are you doing?

Sun--
I said move away!

Sun, listen. I know
You think you're helping--

If it wasn't for you,
Jin would still be alive.

I didn't kill your husband,
Sun, because he's not dead.

You're lying.
No, sun.

How do you know he's alive?!

There's someone Here in los angeles.

Let me take you to them,
And i'll show you the proof.

Someone? Who?

The same person That's gonna show us
How to get back to the island.

Is that what this is about?

This is insane.
You guys are crazy.

Kate--
Jack, don't!

Sayid, where are you going?

I don't want any part of this.
And if i see you or him again...

it'll be extremely
Unpleasant for all of us.

What's a glass
Of that run you?

Whatever it is,
It's worth it.

I don't understand why Someone would
pay 120 bucks For a glass of anything.

If you knew what my drink cost,
Why did you ask me?

You so much as flinch
And you're dead.

I was hired To
bring you to guam.

Who hired you?

The family of peter avellino--

The man you killed in cold blood Last year
on a golf course In the seychelles.

You're going to answer
For what you've done.

Take it.

Before ben brought jack
And sun to eloise hawking,

He provided sun with
proof That jin was alive.

John gave it to me.

Why didn't locke
Tell me himself?

I don't know, but all those
People back on the island,

Jin included,
Need our help.

Will you come with me?

Yes.

What are you doing here?

I assume The same thing you are.

You're looking For
faraday's mother, too?

Eloise hawking was
Daniel faraday's mother

And the person who knew How to get
the oceanic six Back to the island.

What is this place?

The dharma initiative
Called the lamp post.

This is how they
Found the island.

She explained that The
island was always moving.

Consequently, the group Had a very small

There's a commercial airliner
Flying from l.A. To guam--

Ajira airways flight 3-1-6.

It must be that plane.

Excuse me.
Am i really hearing this?

You're all going back
To the island? Willingly?

Yes.

I came here
To deliver a message.

Daniel faraday sent me here.

He wanted me to tell you That he
and all the people On the island 

need your help.

But i am helping, dear.

Consider the message Delivered.

So that's it.

We just get on that flight,

And we just pe that it works?

No, that's not all, jack.

What's this?

It's john locke's Suicide note.

He is going to heLp you get back.

John is going To be a substitute.

A substitute for who?

You need to, As best you can,

Recreate the conditions
Of the original flight,

Which is why you need to give
John something of your father's.

That's what you have to do.
This is ridiculous.

Oh, stop thinking
ow ridiculous it is

And start asking yourself

wether or not you believe
it's going to work.

Jack was not Entirely comfortable
Taking such a leap of faith.

But when he paid A visit
to his grandfather,

He made a timely discovery.

Are these yours, granddad?
Those were your father's.

For kate, A return to the island Was
the furthest thing From her mind.

Aaron? Aaron? Aaron!

But when she nearly lost
Aaron in a supermarket,

Is this your mommy?

She began to question If she was
the right person To be his mother.

As scared as i was,
All i could think was,

It's about time.

I mean, why would i
Expect him to be taken?

Because you took him, kate.

I had to take him.
He needed me.

You need him.

Sawy broke your heart.

How else were you
Supposed to fix it?

Mrs. Littleton,
I'm kate austen.

I know who you are.

Though it was the hardest
Decision of her life,

Kate knew what
needed To be done.

He's waiting for you.

I told him That
you're his grandmother,

That you'll take care

Coming in off a sub rolling Into port right about now.

So we ain't got much time.

You want us to say We came in

Everyone gets knocked
out Before the trip,

So no one meets each other
Until we process 'em.

Your name's gonna be On the list.

So when you get in there,
Just wait for 'e To call your name.

When they do,
just smile, Step up,

And work assignments.

Everybody say,
"namaste."

Namaste.

The remaing survivors
From ajira flight 316

Were trying to sort through
A mystery of their own.

My name is john locke.
