There lies
a sleepy little village,

with the biggest
Christmas spirit.

Look for it on a map,

and you won't be able
to find it.

It is said

that only those in need
of the village's particular joy,

can find their way

to its quiet, welcoming streets.

"And once
these special visitors arrive

in this magical little place,

they experience
a holiday season like no other,

and are reminded
of who they really are

and the true joy and peace

that is the meaning
of Christmas."

Did you really read this book
when you were my age?

Only about a thousand times,

and now,

it belongs to you.

An early Christmas Eve present.

Because you,
my sweet darling girl,

are a very special person

with a very special gift,

and you know
what that means, right?

I will grow up
and do very special things?

That's right.

As long as you follow
your heart and your dreams,

you cannot fail.

But all of Talia's dreams

are filled with pirates
and fairies, sir.

Hey, my dreams are fun!

Look who it is.

Well, happy holidays, Anderson.

Thanks.

I wanted to ask

if Talia could come out
and play with me.

But my dad just got home
from his work trip.

He's reading me my new book.

You should stay and listen.

Actually,
your timing is perfect.

I was just about to whip up
some hot chocolate for us.

Talia, why don't you build
a cozy fort

and you can read it to Anderson?

"The village is ruled

by a beautiful fairy queen

and her handsome king,

but everything you want
was there,

you just had to ask."

I bet I could find Wunderbrook
on a map.

All I'd need is my compass.

No way, it's impossible.

It says so
right on the first page.

You have to have
"forgotten who you are

and forgotten how to dream".

Whatever that means.

Besides, the evil witch
would chase you

and force you out of town,

and then the princess

would give you
a kiss on the cheek

and grant
all your secret wishes.

Secret wishes and kisses?

I don't remember
that part of the story.

Because
I'm making up my own parts.

Thank you.
Thanks.

You're welcome.

Talia is going to be a writer
when she grows up,

because she's always daydreaming

and making things up.

Yeah, I'm going to be famous,

and everyone
will read my stories.

I know you are.

So, what are you going to be

when you grow up, Anderson?

Our teacher says
I should be a doctor.

I think that sounds
like a wonderful idea.

Are you okay, Daddy?

Are you still tired
from your medicine?

A little,
but nothing to worry about.

I'm heading upstairs now.

Don't get into any trouble
down here.

Okay, love you.

I love you, too.

What's that flyer say?

"Good for one free week
at the Gingerbread Inn,

offer will not expire,

transportation provided.

Where is it?

It says "Close by,"

but close by to what?

I guess it's a mystery,

just like Wunderbrook.

I bet nothing bad
ever happens there.

Hi.
Hi.

Do you really have to move away?

Yeah, my mom's
renting out the house.

She wants to be closer to
my aunt and uncle for a while.

She says this house
is too much for one person

since my dad died.

I got you something.

It's so you can
keep writing down

all your stories.

Thank you, Anderson.

I love it.

Maybe you can send me some
in the mail?

When you're feeling better.

I have something for you, too.

I wanted you to have
your own copy,

so you wouldn't forget about me.

Did you hear that?

Hear what?

I thought I heard...

Never mind.

I'm going to miss you.

Me too.

As time continues to pass,

dreams are often in danger
of making way for reality,

but where there is passion
there is hope...

For one dreamer at least.

Hey!

Hi!
Tal!

I'm so excited to see you!

Looks like your
creative juices are flowing.

Oh, no, not exactly.

Just some
exhilarating inventory.

Well, the store looks fantastic.

Thanks so much
for hosting my event,

and so close to Christmas.

Are you kidding?

We have a literary sensation
in our midst.

Come look.

I have a surprise for you.

You ready?

Ta-dah!

Oh!

"Sensation" might be
a bit of a stretch,

but I appreciate
your enthusiasm.

I don't suppose your publisher
gave you any feedback

on my manuscript?

They just got back to me.

They said it was cute,

but they don't think
your stories

are a fit for their brand.

They prefer edgier material.

Right.

Okay.

Well, thank you for trying.

Yeah.

Look.

Someone's in your reading chair.

That's where Miss Talia
reads us her stories

about Mr. Snowflake.

Sloane,
this is my neighbor, Ryan.

And your biggest fan, I see.

Today, Sloane is going
to read part of her book.

She's a real
professional writer.

Talia wondered

if she would ever
find her voice,

or those who would
appreciate her gifts,

while unaware
a friend from the past

was searching
for answers of his own.

Chief, hey, it's, uh,
it's Anderson.

You gotta get somebody
to cover my next procedure.

No, I'll be okay,

I just need a couple of days
to clear my head

and get some rest.

I'll keep you posted.

I'll be back soon, I promise.

Thanks, Chief.

Doubting oneself
does not make for a happy heart,

especially when
that inner conflict spreads

to the loving bond
between two souls.

I got some gifts
for the nieces and nephews,

I just need to find something
for your parents.

Any thoughts?

Keith?

You don't need my two cents.

I'm sure
whatever you pick is fine.

Okay.

Did you remember
to call the plumber?

The leak is getting worse.

I'll do it myself.

Where have I heard that before?

As Diane contemplated

if this was her last Christmas
with Keith,

another soul was desperately
holding onto something

that was already gone.

Bea, honey, I'm home.

How was your day?

I went grocery shopping.

I picked up some of
that almond milk you like.

So fancy.

Remember when it was just
half and half?

Oh, I ran into your friends
from the book club.

They sure miss
having you around.

Little did
these struggling souls know

the forces that would
bring them all together

were already in motion.

Why bother,

you already know
what they're going to say.

"Thank you for your interest,

but we are unable to proceed
with your material

at this time."

like it's really no joke.

Did you say something?

Oh, sorry, no,
I'm just talking to myself.

Have we met?

Sorry, never mind.

You know, I do that a lot
because I read quite often

and so between
all the characters

I envision in my head,

and all the people
that come through this door,

there's just
a lot going on, right?

I also talk a lot.

Talia?

Is that you?

From Rockford Elementary?

Anderson?
Yeah.

What?!
Yeah!

Hi!
Hi!

Wow!

How long has it been?

Not since you and your mom
moved away, right?

When did you come back
to Seattle?

I moved back
into my family's house

after I got my Master's
in writing.

Cool.

I wish I'd known,

I would have invited you out
for coffee or something.

Oh, you know, and I actually
kept meaning to look you up,

but I didn't think
you'd remember me after so long.

Of course, I remember you.

So, which section is yours?

Do you use a nom de plume?

More like a nom de calculator.

This is actually my store.

Oh.
Yeah, which, you know,

requires a surprising amount
of math,

and sadly, not as many
clever turns of phrase.

Ah, well, that's too bad.

I always liked
reading your stuff.

Not that running your own store
isn't also fantastic.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It is, no,

I just,
yours was the only fiction

I ever really got into.

Oh, that's nice.

Well, um, I still dabble,
of course, right?

In fact, publishers
are considering my work

as we speak.

Cool.

What about you?

What about you, what do you do?

I am a surgeon.

Oh!
At Seattle Medical.

But I'm taking
a bit of a vacation.

Oh, hence the need
for reading material?

Yes.

Okay, so, what are you
in the mood for?

Can I offer you
a nice juicy mystery, or...

Maybe something
a little more uplifting

would be a better distraction?

Just what the doctor ordered?

Something like that.
Okay.

So, what you have planned
for the holidays?

My mom's away this year,

but I have other plans.

Loads of plans.

Lots.

Great, well,

we should do that catch-up
after the holidays.

I would love that.

Yeah.

Um, here,
put in your contact info.

Ah, still ordering me around
like old times, huh?

Some things never change.

All right.

Thank you. Here you go.

I think you'll like this one,
it's on me.

Well, thanks.

Text me, and we'll get
that catch-up on the books.

Yeah. Sounds good.

All right.
Okay.

See ya.
Bye.

"I still dabble?"

Good grief, Talia,
you're so lame.

Hey, Mom, guess who I saw today.

Anderson!

Yeah, from back in the day.

Do you remember him?

Oh.

Single?

I have no idea,
we didn't get into all that.

I know, I wish we could
spend Christmas together, too.

Yes, for sure, absolutely.

Okay.

I love you, too.

Bye.

Oh.

Hello?

Hi, Robyn?
It's Talia!

Um...

I know it's been a while,

but I was just wondering

what you were up to
for the holidays?

Oh, dear.
I'm afraid this isn't Robyn.

This is Judy,

and you've reached
the Gingerbread Inn.

I'm sorry, the Gingerbread what?

The Gingerbread Inn, dear.

I'm assuming you called

about the special
getaway promotion?

Deluxe private room,

three home-cooked meals a day,

access to all
festival activities.

That... Wow, that sounds lovely,

but I was actually just trying
to call my friend.

Well...

maybe it's fate.

Those who need it most
tend to find their way to us,

and you're in luck.

We only have two openings left
for this season.

Do let us know soon
if you change your mind.

Okay, great, thank you,

uh, but I will say, um,

I probably will just stay put
and celebrate with my friends,

but I do appreciate the offer.

Very kind.

Okay.

Thank you.

Bye.

Hmm.

Hey, Jenny, it's Talia!

Yeah, hey, I was just wondering
what you were up to this week?

Oh, that's right, yes,

I forgot you were
with Rick's family.

Okay.

All right, well, have fun.

Bye.

Hi, we spoke
earlier this evening.

Yeah, you know,
I've been thinking,

and I changed my mind.

I'd be thrilled
to accept your offer.

Where in the world am I?

Wunderbrook?

Be right there!

Welcome to the Gingerbread Inn.

I'm Judy, and I'll be your host.

Is everything okay?

I don't know.

I'm having major deja vu.

You know, this place
looks a lot like the...

Never mind, never mind.

It's just my imagination
working on overdrive again.

Ignore me.

Okay, I'm clearly exhausted.

I was, like, nodding off
in the car ride over here.

Thank you for arranging that,
by the way.

We are delighted to have you.

Please...

accept your welcome basket.

Oh!

I asked you three times
to pack an extra charger.

Why didn't you email me
the task list?

Talia, meet Diane and Keith,

two of our other guests.

Oh, and this is Charles.

My husband, Miles, is bringing
you some spare clothes.

They're not exactly
fashionable, but...

Oh, I appreciate the generosity.

I didn't expect to be staying,

so I just brought
my fishing gear.

Oh!

Jake, what's the matter?

A car was detoured our direction

on the way up the coast,

and the driver says
it's running funny.

I told him to come on over.

He's grabbing his suitcase.

Anderson?

Seriously?

Yeah, I think? Hi.

Hi.

You know each other?

Uh, yeah,

but we haven't seen each other
for like almost 30 years.

Yeah,

and now it's twice
in the same week.

He's stalking me, it's fine.

Sounds like kismet to me.

Really?

Well, I'll go see
if I can figure out

what's going on with that detour

and take a look at your car.

I'm sort of the
Jake-of-all-trades around here.

Get it?
Yeah.

Well, that would be great.

I'm sure I'll figure it out
by the morning.

Well, gotta get going,
lots to do.

Oh, and in the meantime,
I've got an extra room for you.

I've got some lovely desserts
in this other room.

I'm just going to turn in.

I should probably
get some work done.

I'll be upstairs, okay?
Okay.

I don't want to get in his way,

but I'm not very hungry,

so I'm just going to go read.

And then there were two.

This way to the dining room.

Delicious hot cocoa for you?

Oh.
Yeah, thank you.

Well, I'm hoping to figure out
what's wrong with the car.

I'm aiming to get out of here
as soon as I can.

I'm sure he will.

Excuse me.

So, I thought you were
stay-cationing in Seattle

with loads of plans.

Oh, yeah, uh,

I may have embellished that
a little bit.

Ah.

Okay, you have to admit

that it's a wild coincidence

that we're both here, right?

Okay.

It was synergy.

Ah, I thought the word
was "kismet".

Only five visitors this year.

Not a ton,
but we can make it work.

Maybe.

Assuming they have
a successful stay with us.

I can't wait
to meet the new people.

I have so many questions.

I told you, Izzy,
you're not to bother the guests.

I won't, Mom, I promise.

I don't know
why you're all so excited.

Interlopers,

that's what they are.

I wish they'd all just
stay away and leave us be.

Oh, Mildred,

I know it's hard for you
to forget the past.

Maybe this season
we can change how you feel.

Now, we only have
until the conclusion

on the Night of Wunder,

on the 23rd, same as every year,

to get everyone sorted.

We all have our roles to play

and not much time to do it.

So...

let's get to it.

Ho! Ho! Ho!

And so, Mildred
reluctantly pondered her role

in the fate
of this year's guests.

What obstacles
could she lay in their paths?

Apparently,
the road to the cabin

is going to be closed
longer than they thought,

and my car is still
out of commission.

Please.
Thank you.

Yeah.

So, I'm going to try
and book a Ride-share

so I can take off.

You sure you want to leave
so soon?

There's something
in the air here.

Keith, the plumber said

he could start
on the repairs today.

Our house flooded,

which is why we had
to clear out last minute.

Then I found a flyer
for this inn.

It was in the mailbox
without a stamp.

It was the oddest thing.

What about you, Charles?

How did you find your way here?

Oh.

Boredom.

I've fished every fishing spot
there is to fish in Idaho.

You came all this way to fish?

And to think.

Yeah.

I got a little lost
on the way...

found my way here somehow,

Judy offered me a room.

I figured I'd better stay put
before I really got lost.

How about you, Talia?

Well, I called the wrong number

and Anderson got re-routed
on a detour, so...

It's kind of like a force
drew us all here

or something, right?

You haven't changed a bit.

That overactive imagination
still working double-time.

Hi! I'm Izzy.

Judy and Miles are my parents.

Can I show you all around

before you get started
with your day?

My mom said it's okay.

Oh, our very own tour guide!

I'll pass.

I'm not in the mood for a tour.

Sounds good to me.
Yeah.

Keith?

I should finish my brief.

There's so many places
you can visit.

There's
Mildred's Miracle Tavern.

It's the nicest
restaurant around.

Even though Mildred isn't always
the nicest person around.

Don't tell her I said that!

I swear, it's the oddest thing.

I just know
I've been here before.

Impossible.

I've never seen you,
and I never forget a face.

My mom says
it's like a super power.

Oh, well, that's impressive.

Okay, but continue, Izzy,
this is so exciting!

And it'll get even better.

The tree lighting is tonight.

The official start
of our Wunder Week.

"Wunder Week"?

Okay, I know
I've heard that before.

Me too.

Maybe a client...

What do you and Keith
do for work?

Oh, we're both lawyers.

I just made partner at my firm,

and Keith is a public defender.

What about you, Anderson?

What do you do?

I just became an attending,

so I supervise
my own group of residents.

Surrounded
by doctors and lawyers.

Suddenly,
I feel deeply inadequate.

Aw, when you're a big,
hot-shot author,

you'll forget all about us.

Aw, you sound like my dad.

He passed away when we were ten.

He was just
my biggest cheerleader.

I miss him every day.

Hello there.

You interested
in something to go?

Got anything on tap?

Can I see a food menu?

No substitutions, no exceptions.

Don't worry,

the only thing I'm allergic to
is excessive pleasantries,

and I don't think that's going
to be an issue here.

Goulash is my specialty.

I'll have
a specialty goulash then.

To stay.

Can I ask you something?

This whole village

looks like a Christmas elf
exploded on it,

but here, not so much.

I used to go all out.

For years,
this was the place to beat

for best storefront
on Main Street.

And then?

I'm over it, as the kids say.

You and me both.

I wish it was January already.

Oh, Charles!

This is where
you've been hiding.

Not hiding.

I just prefer to avoid
the holiday hoopla.

Oh.

I can recommend the goulash.

No substitutions.

Sounds perfect.
Three orders?

Sure.

So, did you have a good day?

I did.

I had a pleasant enough
conversation with Mildred.

She's... interesting.

This place is nice.

Yeah.

Hey!

Now, that is the kind of service
you do not get in the city.

It's a little too good.

Keith would send it back.

He'd be suspicious
it'd been sitting out too long.

How'd you kids meet?

Oh, we were on rival quiz teams.

I beat him during the round

on the billboard charts
of the '90s.

So how'd you go from rivalry
to romance?

He said since I bested him
in front of his friends,

the least I could do
was join him for dinner.

After that, we were inseparable.

Ah, young love at its finest.

It's all so fleeting.

Okay, we better get this in.

It's the opening night
of Wunder Week.

Uh, hello?

Can you guys hear me out there?

Welcome, residents and guests.

I'm Mayor Miles,

and starting tonight,

we kick off our Wunder Week.

Inspiration
for your next project?

Oh, no,

I can't even think about
another project right now.

I'm tapped...

and honestly,

the writing thing...
isn't really happening for me.

Well, that's a shame.

I liked getting your stories
in the mail.

I was sad
when you stopped sending them.

You don't have to say that.

Anyway, that was a lifetime ago.

We should buy some souvenirs
when the market opens.

I don't know if this is a season

we want to remember.

Let's light it up!

What do you say, folks?

Okay!

Three, two, one!

This village would look
even more picturesque

if it were snowing,

don't you think?

What did I tell ya?

In Wunderbrook
a little magic goes a long way,

but there's so much to do,

and such little time.

Chapter three.

Only five days until
the Night of Wunder deadline,

and no one is making
significant progress.

Personally, I'll be glad

when the tourists
stop infesting our home.

Every year, we give and give

and are left
with nothing in return.

I'm sick of it.

That's not true.

We're left
knowing we helped someone

overcome a challenge
in their life

and move forward.

The problem isn't just
receding tourism.

If we fail,

visitors won't have the ability
to find their way to us anymore.

Oh, this looks good.

Ready for
the ultimate taste test?

Oh, so glad
you guys could make it.

We have to guess
the different flavors

in the hot chocolate.

Oh, fun!

When we were first together,

Keith and I used to try
new restaurants once a week,

and guess the ingredients
and the spices in their dishes.

Blindfolds at the ready.

Okay.
It's time to get tasting!

All right. Thank you.

You first.
Me first.

Definitely smells like coconut.

Gold sprinkles?

I was just about to eat this.

Ah!

Hey, you guys are cheating,
I saw that.

Weird. Your sister said
she sent our gifts here,

but the courier couldn't find
the address.

Maybe the village
is unincorporated.

Off-grid.

That's odd.

We already
tried that one, Keith.

Yep, I know.

Just wanted a second taste,

if that's all right with you?

Okay, come on, Keith.

Let's go, drink it up!
Time's a-ticking.

Okay, tastebuds
on the prize, right?

Right, so you'll listen to her.

Yeah, because she doesn't
treat me like an employee.

Um...

I'm going to go back to the inn.

Thank you.

You're doing better
than I thought, Dr. A.

Thanks.

You can just
call me Anderson, Izzy,

and yeah,
maybe I can add hot cocoa

to the short list of things
that I can make.

Maybe you can make one
for your girlfriend.

Wait...

Do you have a girlfriend?

No, I am married to my work.

What about you, Talia?

You got a boyfriend
back in Seattle?

No, no, the only relationships
I've been in recently

are from the romance section
in my bookstore.

So you're both single!

Um...

well...

Thanks.

So, what kind of
"wunder" ful joy

did everybody get up to today?

You'd know if you joined in.

The festival
is a community event

and right now you're
part of that community.

I used to love the holidays.

But it's just...

it's not the same

going through the motions
without my Bea.

Is that your wife?

My high-school sweetheart.

We were married 42 years.

She did the bookkeeping
at my shop.

She was a whiz with numbers.

Couldn't style her hair
to save her life.

Sounds like
you made quite the duo.

We did.

She passed

three years ago.

Cancer.

I'm sorry, Charles.

I'd give anything
to see my Bea again.

Just for 10 minutes,

even if all we did was bicker.

She brought so much color
to my life.

You still deserve
to experience joy, Charles.

Did you know that Charles
is a widower?

Sorry?

I just overheard him
telling Judy.

He misses her so much,

and here I am,
constantly at odds with Keith.

I just...

I feel so horrible.

Do you want to come in
for a minute?

Yeah.

I'm a pretty good talker,

but I think I might be
a better listener.

Have a seat.

So, what's really going on
with you and Keith?

Besides a flooded house.

He never listens to me.

He just tunes me out,
like I don't even exist.

I'm sorry, Diane.

Maybe it's normal
in a long-term relationship?

I don't know.

I filed for divorce.

Oh.

I haven't served him
the papers yet.

I wanted to wait
until after the holidays,

and I thought maybe this trip

would be our last chance
to reconnect,

but he's...

You know, enough about me.

How about you and Anderson?

I've been sensing a vibe
between you two.

No, no, no.

We're just old friends.

Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?

Oh, no.
We were just chatting.

Yeah.
Were your ears burning?

Should they be?

No, they shouldn't be.

We were just...

wondering
where everyone was.

And here you are!

I mean, not just you,

like, everyone, all the people.

Well, I am here,

and everybody else
is going downstairs.

Miles invited us for story hour.

That sounds like fun.

Yeah.

Shall we?
We shall.

Okay. Let's go.

Oh, this looks like story hour
at my bookstore.

What's a story hour?

There are kids
in my neighborhood

whose parents
struggle to find childcare.

So they come,
and they read books,

and they hang out.

I tell them
some of my own stories, too.

Well, I used to anyway.

I would have loved
something like that as a kid.

However, um, this event
isn't quite the same.

Our tradition

is to create
an original holiday story

every year.

How does it work?

We all take turns.

Whoever has the microphone
is the storyteller.

Izzy, why don't you kick us off?

Okay.

There once was a lonely snowman,

who wanted to meet
a special snowlady

and fall in love.

Ooh...

Uh, so, he joined an app...

called the Icy Connection...

Uh... hoping to find a match.

And...

all anybody ever wanted from him

was advice on how not to melt.

Hey, no, this is...

This is
from real-life experience

from the five minutes
that I spent on a dating app.

Here, take it for a spin.

Uh, no, no...

No, no, no, no
Here you go. Your turn.

Hey, aren't you the pro?

Fine, okay.

Um...

but when the snowman
looked in the mirror,

he wondered, sadly,

why he could never frolic
in the sun,

and so began
his existential quest

to understand
his elemental nature,

for how could he ever partner

with another snowy creature,

knowing that a terrible,
puddly fate

awaited them both?

Oh...

Then what happened?

Well, he moved
to the North Pole, of course,

where he would be safe
to find love all year round!

Oh!

Brilliant!

Okay, here.

Okay, that is
a tough act to follow.

I know, right?
Show-off.

No, but, really,
you have a gift.

Maybe it's time to pick up
that pen again?

Oh, hey, Mildred,

I just stepped out
to get some air.

Are you joining us or...

Jake asked me
to bring you these.

Looks like the roads
are open now.

Your car seems to be running
just fine.

You're free to leave
and be on your way,

bright and early tomorrow.

Thanks.

Something the matter?

Nice stunt with the keys.

Classic, Mildred.

Stunt?

I was just returning a man
his property.

Mildred, you have to let
things unfold

the way they are meant to

until we've helped them
sort their lives.

I am just playing my role,
and you know it.

Besides,
the magic is almost done.

Tick tock, tick tock.

Will Mildred's meddling ways

obstruct
the townspeople's quest?

Chapter four.

Oh, hi.
Hey.

You got your keys back.

Yeah, yeah, looks like
the detour is cleared up,

and my car is okay.

So, you're heading out?

Actually,

I don't know.

I was putting some stuff
in my trunk,

and I suddenly had
this overwhelming feeling

that I needed to stay.

It's hard to explain,

but I hope you're okay

sharing a bit more
of your vacation with me.

I can live with that.

All right.

What's up?

Oh, I found this
by my door earlier.

You didn't leave it there,
did you?

No.

No, I can't
claim credit for that one.

That's strange.

Anyway, I love it

and I've been writing
all morning.

What about?

Well, I'm noodling
on a holiday story

about this village,

and its precocious
resident tween.

Ah, so Izzy is your muse.

Well, I'm available to be
your first reader,

whenever you're ready to share.

I might take you up on that.

All right.

Let me guess,

you're responsible
for that notebook's appearance?

If only I could wave my wand

and have them all
face their inner demons.

You know we can only provide

a positive,
uplifting experience.

Our guests have to figure out
their issues on their own.

You've practically been
all over the world.

I have, everywhere
but the North Pole.

Oh, I'm so envious.

You know,
I get to travel, too, you know,

yeah, when I read.

Well, put some of them
on your bucket list.

You know, I don't actually
believe in those.

My dad had this whole endless
list of places he wanted to see,

and he barely made a dent in it.

It just broke my heart,

but feel free to regale me
in more of your adventures.

So, where to next?

I'm not sure I'm going
to do it again this year.

Why?

You have
too many responsibilities

as an attending?

Not exactly.

Uh...

anything you want
to get off your chest?

I hate kale.

There, I said it.

Okay.

Excuse me, Charles?

Jake?

I'm supposed to play Santa,

but I have to set up
the grounds for later.

Would you be willing to step in
and play Santa for me?

Ah, I don't think so.

Get him to do it.

Anderson?

He doesn't have the gravitas
or the wisdom for it.

I don't know
what we're talking about,

but I think I'm insulted?

Since I have you,

would you two be willing
to play Santa's elves?

Uh... hold on,
are there costumes?

Yes!

See, Charles?

Everyone wants in.

Please, I'm begging you.

There's no one else,
and the kids are waiting.

I'll give you an hour.

Merry Christmas.

Here to make your wish?

I'm...
here to fix Santa's beard.

Who's in charge here?

Where's Jake?

What's wrong with my beard?

If you're going to do something,

you can't do it halfway.

You sound a lot like my Bea.

She was an all or nothing girl.

She sounds like a wise woman.

You were lucky to have her.

I should, um...

get back to the tavern.

Okay, who's next?

Climb aboard, Izzy.

You know, Anderson,

if things don't work out for you
at the hospital,

I see a future for you
in elfin arts.

Haha.

Tell Santa your wish, kiddo.

Mr. Santa,

this year, I'd like to wish
for a bicycle,

a dollhouse,
a sewing machine, a...

Whoa!

Slow down, young lady.

Mr. Santa,

most of all,

I want to see
my new friend, Charles,

smile again.

That's a very generous wish.

Well,

that was shockingly exhausting.

Yeah,

and actually,

I was kind of hoping
to sit on Santa's lap,

but the kids
had dibs on his time.

Childhood has its perks.

What would you have wished for?

Oh, well,

there's a first edition
of Jane Austen's Emma

that I've been coveting.

What about you,

a new stethoscope or something?

No, no, I've got
plenty of those.

Actually, I like...
I like your idea.

I think I'm plagiarizing you.

Yeah?

I've been meaning to read
more Jane Austen.

Oh!

Oh, ho!

Hey there.

You burst in here like
you're running from someone.

No, no, I'm just...

I'm avoiding a conversation
with Diane,

to be completely honest.

Oh.

We need to sit down
and have a real conversation,

but I just freeze up
every time I see her.

Hmm.

Tell me more.

I forgot to call the plumber,

which is just a tiny thing,

but it's another example
of me just freezing up.

She treats me like an employee,
not a partner.

Reminds me of me and Judy.

I'm always letting something
fall through the cracks.

Is it really about the plumber, though?

Who knows?

Ever since Diane made partner,

she's been so stressed
with work.

I just want to go back
to when things were simpler.

When was the last time
you had a date night

that was just about
the two of you,

not your task-lists?

Huh...

No idea.

We've been so caught up
with our frustrations,

not our romance.

May I suggest

taking a time-out
from the acrimony?

Try to remember

why you fell in love
to begin with.

Yeah.

Thanks.

I have to admit,
this place is pretty magical.

Do you have the same events
and artisans every year?

Pretty much.

Most are annual traditions,

but some are new,

and we escalate,

as we get to the final
Night of Wunder.

Wait, "Night of Wunder"?

Okay, that is not a coincidence,

that is straight out of a book
I loved as a kid.

It was...

Oh! A Wunderbrook
Christmas Story.

Oh, yeah!

A Wunderbrook Christmas Story.

I knew this seemed familiar.

Okay, so you've read it, too?

Oh, yeah.
I loved it back in the day.

My cousin and I
would read it to each other

over and over again.

That's what Talia and I
used to do

before she moved away.

Hold on a second.

My mother gave it to me, too.

Hey, are you,

are you familiar

with A Wunderbrook
Christmas Story?

Sure, it's a classic.

Why do you ask?

It's just, it's been
a favorite of ours

since we were kids, so...

I'm surprised it's still popular

with your generation.

I'm going to turn in.

Goodnight.

Okay.

We've all read
the same Christmas book,

and we've all
mysteriously arrived

in the same village?

I know my imagination
is a little overactive,

but this is too much.

What is going on?

Excuse me a second.

How was the...

What can you tell me
about "inner conflict"?

Is that the name
of a rock 'n' roll group?

I'm afraid
I'm not too up to date

with my pop-culture facts.

Level with me, Judy.

There's something
very curious going on here.

Have you been sneaking
into my spiked eggnog reserves?

I'm serious.

Wouldn't you agree

it's a little odd

that all five of your guests

have old copies of
A Wunderbrook Christmas Story?

Not really.

It was a major best-seller
in its heyday.

Okay, but all your events
come from the book.

How do you explain that?

I admit,
we borrow some of their ideas.

I didn't realize that was
a copyright infringement.

Right.

Of course, it isn't.

I'm sorry I came at you
with so much intensity.

I just sometimes get an idea,
and I run away with it, and...

yeah.

Goodnight!

Wunderbrook's secret

was kept safe
by the Fairy Queen,

but for how long?

Chapter five.

Hello?
Earth to Talia?

Oh, hi.
Hey.

Sorry, I'm just looking up
images of Wunderbrook,

trying to refresh my memory.

I thought Judy talked you
out of that conspiracy theory.

Ooh, I just lost my connection.

Maybe that's
not such a bad thing.

Oh.

Thank you.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Mm!

For today's activity,

you are not casual
Christmas enthusiasts.

Instead,

you are craft specialists.

Aye-aye, Captain.
What are we making?

Christmas stockings,

and if you'd like,

you can leave them
on the inn's mantel

as a memento of your stay.

I just thought it was about time

I joined the merriment.

Let's get started.

That looks...

interesting.

I have a vision
for a baroque design,

but I think my eyes
might be bigger

than my artistic aptitudes.

Well, it's the thought
that counts.

Oh, yours is perfect, Anderson.

Looks like you're putting
your surgical dexterity

to good use over there, Doc.

Thank you.

So, Diane and I will be
flying out of Seattle

when we go home.

I thought we could make
a date night of it.

Really?

Oh, that's so nice.

I don't remember the last time
we had a date night.

Do you have any suggestions
of restaurants that we can go to

for a special occasion?

Yeah, Francesco's.
Francesco's.

You've been?
Yeah.

I've been dying to go.

I took my first ever
dating-site match there

a few months ago.

She spent the whole dinner

asking me about
her mom's medications.

Oh.

Well, he's married
to his work anyway.

Aren't you?
Yeah.

For years I was consumed
by my surgical residency,

but...

now I think

maybe I am ready to find
the right person

to share my life with.

Well, you better
get back on that app then.

You know, I actually
think it's better

just to meet in real life,

you know, more organic.

Yeah, like Keith and Diane did.

Oh, when we first met,
I wasn't looking to settle down.

We were so young.

But when you know...

Jake called to check in.

Sounds like the group

is really starting
to open up to each other.

Good,

but sharing stories

isn't going to be enough
to complete our mission.

You know that.

No, but it is a step
in the right direction.

Perhaps, but beyond that,

I think Talia is starting
to put things together.

She's clever, that one.

Relax, honey.
It's a good sign.

She's using the gift
of her imagination.

How did you get to be
so optimistic?

Would you have me be
any other way?

You know I wouldn't.

Isn't that fun?

Ah, there you are!

Diane and Keith are going to
come hang their stockings later,

but you guys can do it now.

Okay.

So cute.

Oh, that looks so good.

Are these past Wunder Weeks?

Yeah.

Indeed.

We used to get
a lot more visitors here

in the past,

but quality over quantity, right?

Oh, Miles,

you forgot to take a photo
of our group this year!

Again!

Oh.

Get in there. Great.

Aw, you guys look great.

Okay, ready?

Say "tinsel"!

One, two, three!

Tinsel!

Got it!

Hey.

You okay?

You look upset.

Still mulling
the Wunderbrook connection?

Oh, no, no.

I'm just about to head
to Mildred's to write.

I need a quiet space

and no one's ever there.

Yeah, thanks.

I just, um,

keep thinking
about Keith and Diane.

I hope they work it out,
you know?

Yeah.

What about you?

You, uh, thinking about
going back to the app?

Maybe?

Like I said,

dating hasn't been a priority
in a long time,

but...

I'd like to make it one.

And you?

Gonna get back out there?

Oh, uh, no...

I don't know.

The next guy on my radar

will probably think
I'm too outlandish.

Yeah, like
my last boyfriend did.

That's just 'cause
he didn't realize

what a catch you are.

Oh, well,

he is not the first guy
to accuse me

of getting lost in my daydreams.

Well, I always thought
your overactive imagination

was part of your charm.

Besides, isn't teasing
what boys do

when they have a crush?

Why do you think
I was always coming around

to give you a hard time?

Can we talk?

Yeah.

I feel like
we've become strangers, Keith.

I definitely feel
the distance between us,

especially
since you went for partner.

I feel it, too,

and I know I ask a lot,

and that I've been
putting work first,

and it's hard on you,

and us.

Thank you,

for acknowledging that.

But it's not all on you, D.

I know I haven't adjusted
as well as I should.

I just...

miss you.

We were always
each other's rocks.

I'm your rock?

You miss me?

Yeah.

Well, I can be
pretty great, huh?

I know you're going to make
a great partner,

and I'm here for you,

that's never going to change.

I just need my partner, too.

I need you, Diane.

I need you, too, Keith.

I need you.

The magic wish...

kiss...

Um, Mildred, can I get
a little more coffee?

I'm on a roll here
with my story.

You're brave.

Hmm?

Only a select few ever make it

as professional writers.

Personally, I couldn't handle
the disappointment.

Well, that's true.

I mean, it hasn't always
been easy.

You have to have
the perfect storm

of luck,

talent,

and circumstance.

It's probably more likely
to win the lottery.

Yeah.

Well, thank you, Mildred,

that's really sage advice.

Wunderbrook's charm

may be helping some,

but others' dreams
remained challenged

by a sprinkle of doubt.

Chapter six.

Where's Diane and Keith
this morning?

I don't know.

They're usually up
before everyone, aren't they?

Let me guess,

you're imagining some scenario

in which they're trapped
in the bottom of a well?

Please, that's so basic.

Are you leaving?
So soon?

We are.

We talked last night.

Really talked.

How'd that go?

We realized
we missed what we had,

and as a wise person
once told me,

it's all so fleeting.

We want to make
our marriage work,

and as lovely
as this village is,

and as warmly
as we have been welcomed,

we need to spend some time
with each other.

Get back to why we fell in love.

And it's been so good
getting to know you.

You as well, but don't think
you're getting rid of us

so soon,

we're going to visit you
in Seattle.

Goodbye, Diane.

It was so nice to meet you, man.

It has been our honor
having you here with us.

Thank you, everyone.

Happy holidays, everyone. Bye.

Happy holidays.

Enjoy the rest of your stay.
Merry Christmas.

Did you hear that?
Yeah.

Maybe it's coming from outside?

Must be it.

Well, today
is our famous market day,

not to be missed.

Charles.

Something I can help you with?

Um, I don't suppose

you've got any extra
Christmas decorations around?

Are those...

decorations?

Nope.

Judy let me borrow them
from the inn.

Thought you and I
could spruce up the joint.

I told you,

I'm over all that.

Well, get under it.

You know, I never thought
I'd celebrate the season again,

but my time here
has been quite eye-opening.

How wonderful.

Another satisfied customer.

Judy will be tickled.

Frankly,

I've been bitter
about the holidays,

but if I'm being honest,

it's because I've been lonely...

and I think
you might be, too.

Come on, humor me.

A little tinsel
never hurt anybody.

Fine,

but if anyone asks,

you broke in here
and did all this yourself.

Consider me guilty as charged.

Here.

I made it myself.

You made this?

For me?

With my eyesight,

my skills aren't
what they used to be.

Try not to judge
the workmanship.

It's perfect.

No one has thought
to do anything this nice for me

in a very long time.

Thank you.

I got you an ornament
with a surgeon's mask,

and it is so you.

Do you want to see?

Yeah.

Isn't it cute?

Yeah.

Yeah, thank you.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I just... I don't know.

I don't know if I can continue
to practice medicine.

Look, I'm not very good
at letting people in,

but you're also
not just people, so...

I'm going to share
something with you

that I'd really like
to stay between us.

Yeah, you got it.

All right.

A few weeks ago,
I had a patient in

for a routine appendectomy,

which ordinarily is a procedure
that I can perform in my sleep,

but the patient developed peritonitis

and then sepsis,

and I couldn't save them.

Oh, Anderson,

I'm so sorry.

Was this the first patient
you've lost?

No,

but it is the first
that I've lost

since I've become
the attending in charge,

and it was devastating.

I had to deliver the news
to the family,

which is something
that I've had to do before,

but something about this one
was different.

I don't know.

I have one job,

and that is to save
their loved one,

and I couldn't do it,

and I've been on leave
ever since.

The hospital put you on leave?

No.

I put myself on leave.

Was there something
you could have done differently

for the patient?

No.

Okay, well then, it sounds to me

like you're punishing yourself

for something that was...

sadly unavoidable.

What if it happens again?

Anderson, do not let
one incident derail you

from what you were born to do.

You're a doctor.

That is your calling.

Well, speaking of your calling,

would you let a few rejections

derail you from your career?

That's your calling.

Not the same.

If you say so.

Anyways, thanks for listening.

It felt good
to get that off my chest.

Can we keep it between us?

Of course, of course.

I'm always here for you.

I know.

Same.

Oh!

Now, what is going on here?

You've never seen
Christmas spirit

on display before?

Well, it looks fantastic.

I think we're just about done.

You'll have to come back
at night

and see the lights in action.

It's a date.

And then she giggled!
Mildred.

I saw it with my own two eyes.

Charles was positively buoyant.

He must derive his own joy
from uplifting others.

That's an intriguing notion.

Perhaps that's Mildred's gift.

Helping others find joy
by challenging the status quo.

And maybe she finds
her own joy along the way.

Maybe.

But I think
Charles also has a crush on her.

Oh, I see.
"Takes one to know one."

Isn't that the relevant phrase?

I see the way
you look at Anderson.

No.

No, no.

I look at him normally!

Ooh, the lady
doth protest too much.

I admit nothing...

And hypothetically,
it wouldn't matter anyway.

We've just resumed
our friendship

and I would never want
to jeopardize that.

So, you think telling him
how you feel

could jeopardize
your relationship?

Hypothetically?

Okay. He may have had
a schoolboy crush on me

when we were kids,

but he needs
an accomplished woman,

someone further along
in their career.

I do not fit that description.

Okay, but what if
you're wrong about that?

Is it simply Christmas cheer,

or is something
even more magical

spreading through Wunderbrook?

Chapter seven.

Hey.

Morning, sunshine.

Morning.

Bought you something.

Oh, thank you.

Look at you helping out.

It's like you're teacher's pet.

No.

Oh, it's true.
You guys are basically

the king and queen
of this village.

No, we're not!

That's absurd.

No, I meant you're the mayor

and Judy's
basically in charge of things?

It's all a group effort.

Good morning!

We're on our way to grab
the bells for the procession.

The princess and the fool...

just like in the book.

What?
What?

Oh, sorry.
I think I'm still half asleep.

Oh, back again, huh?

You're going to get
sick of my cooking.

I doubt that.

But I'm not here to eat.

I'm here to invite you

to accompany me
to the procession tonight.

You're going to that?

I was planning to finish
my year-end accounting tonight.

Mildred,

it would be my honor

to escort you this evening.

Maybe.

If I can find the time.

You look beautiful.

Not that you don't usually...

You just...
You look extra radiant.

You look pretty good yourself.

Judy lent me this coat.

Isn't it great?
Yeah.

Shall we?
Yes.

One for you.
Thank you.

One for you.

I am not exactly
a musical prodigy.

Well, these bells

have a way of maintaining
a harmony all on their own.

He means try your best.

You okay, Charles?

Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

I was just...
I was hoping that...

it's okay.

My mom and Uncle Jake
have to lead the procession.

I'll walk with you!

That's very kind, young lady.

Well, shall we?

My dad would get
such a kick out of this.

He loved pageantry.

What do you mean?

He said I was born
to do great things,

but I have zip
to show for myself,

other than a career that stalled
before it even began.

I sometimes feel like
I let him down.

You could never.

Look, it's
a really tough industry

and he would be so proud
of how hard you tried.

It's just, like,

whenever I try
to consider my future,

it's paralyzing.

It's almost like

I can only imagine
the worst-case scenario

when the subject is myself.

Is this a mid-life crisis?

I don't know
anything about that,

but I do know

that your father loved you
more than anything,

and it has nothing to do
with your accomplishments.

Thanks, Anderson.
That means a lot.

Now, please,
no more compliments,

otherwise it's going to go
to my head.

May I have this dance?

You may.

Just don't expect me
to trip all over your feet.

I've got some moves.
Yeah?

Yeah.

You're fashionably late.

But you look lovely.

Shall we?
Oh. Okay.

If you insist.

Aw! Could they be any cuter?

Looks like love is in the air.

Mildred, when I first
arrived here,

I was such a miserable Grinch.

Well, it takes one to know one.

I'm not exactly
the life of the party.

Maybe not,

but in this short
amount of time,

you've brought so much color
back into my life.

Thank you.

Now, don't tell anyone
I said this,

but...

I'm glad you showed up here.

Did you hear that?

Yeah.

I have been racking my brain

trying to figure out
when I've heard that before...

And do you know when it was?

I'm going to tell you.

It was when my dad

gave me a copy of
A Wunderbrook Christmas Story.

And I heard it again
when I gave a copy to you.

Really?

Hang on a second.

Excuse me.
Judy, Miles.

Hi.
Hi.

Could you guys please just admit

that something magical
is going on here?

Magical?

Christmas is a magical time.

I'll admit that the village
has its quirks,

but isn't this a bit much?

Okay. Five disparate people
show up

through very strange circumstances

to the same town,

all coincidentally having read
the same fairy-tale story?

It is completely improbable

without some
otherworldly explanation.

Not to mention,

all five of us

had very obvious
emotional challenges

we needed to overcome.

Keith and Diane's marriage
was falling apart,

Charles was grieving,

I'm clearly a disaster,

this guy has lost a patient...

Uh-uh!

Enough is enough.

Imagination is one thing,

but this is crazy.

What will you
accuse us all of next?

You have got to stop
living in your daydream

and pay attention
to reality, dear.

So you all think I'm ridiculous?

Your mind is obviously
playing tricks on you

so you don't
have to face the truth.

Which is?

That you have been so afraid

that you've allowed
your dreams to fail.

Wait, that's not fair.

Well, at least
she didn't abandon

a well-earned profession...

Something that could
actually save peoples' lives.

Mildred! I thought
you had turned over a new leaf.

How could you?

And a leopard
doesn't change its spots.

This is what happens

when you invite me
to these things.

I asked you
to keep that between us.

I'm sorry.
It just slipped out.

Yeah, you really
got carried away.

Maybe Mildred's got a point.

So much
for my active imagination

being part of my charm
then, huh?

It's not like she was
so off-base about you either.

I'm sorry, everybody,

you don't deserve us
messing up your night.

Anderson, let's go for a walk,
let you decompress...

I'm just going
to go back to the inn.

I'm taking off
first thing in the morning.

But the Night of Wunder is...

Something I'll have to miss.

Though truth
is welcome in Wunderbrook,

some truths can cause
more heartbreak than healing.

Is there anything I can do
to change your mind?

Judy, you've been
an excellent host.

I gotta be on my way.

Okay, well, if you must go,
we understand.

Please do come back
and visit us again?

Thanks for everything.

Oh! Hey, Charles.

Dramatic night last night.

You're not kidding.

I don't know what to make of it.

I'm turning it around
in my head.

Charles, are you okay?

I don't...

Something's not right.

Judy! Anybody!
I need some help here!

Where's my phone?

Charles, can you hear us?

Do something.

Judy? What's wrong?

It's Charles.

His breathing was shallow
and he fainted.

I didn't know...
Anderson, help him, please.

We think he's having
a heart attack.

I need my medical bag
out of my car.

On it.

Well, Charles is settled
into his room.

His blood pressure
dropped suddenly,

which mimics a heart attack.

But he just needs to hydrate
and up his sodium intake

and he'll be fine.

Thank goodness, you were here.

Thank goodness,
I had left my phone.

I thought I had it.

Just glad it all worked out.

So, how did it feel,

getting back into doctor mode?

It felt...

it felt like my calling.

It is, Anderson.

This is your gift.

And the world needs it.

The world needs you.

Okay, is this a prank?

Because if it is,
it's not funny, all right,

especially after
the day I've had.

Judy,

I think it's time

we told the good doctor
the truth.

Wait, start over here.
You lost me.

So...

so you're telling me

that this town is from
a made-up Christmas fable?

Yes, Anderson.
It is.

And the chimes?

The first time it rings

is when someone
receives the book.

The second time,

it signifies
the healing was successful.

We know it's a lot to take in,

but this is all very real.

So she was right?

About everything?

I gotta tell her...
No, wait, wait.

You can't.

If she knows the truth,

it'll interfere with
the integrity of the process.

I see.

You know, for a made-up village,
you guys have a lot of rules.

Come in.

I won't stay,
but I heard what happened.

I brought you
some of your favorites.

Extra sodium,

as per Doc Anderson's
instructions.

How come you went after
him and Talia like that?

I heard about your reputation,

but you were so biting.

I don't recognize you.

I wish
I could make you understand.

But please believe,

I'm still the same person
you invited to the procession.

Rest up, Charlie.

Ladies and Gentlemen!

Welcome to the most magical
night of the year!

Welcome to the Night of Wunder.

Pretty "wunder" ful, huh?

You're still here?

Turns out there's no place else
I needed to be.

I...

I heard Charles is on the mend.

Are you okay?

Yeah, yeah,

I think I got my sea-legs back.

Thanks to your encouragement.

I'm really sorry...
I...

Please. Ladies first.

I'm really sorry

that I revealed
your private information.

I just got caught up

in this crazy conspiracy theory

and it just slipped out.

It's okay.

I'm sorry
that I took Mildred's side.

I, of all people,

should know how anxiety
can take hold.

Truce?

I think I can live with that.

And I promise,

that is the last time

I'm going to let
my imagination run wild.

I actually convinced myself

that I was
in some magical world.

It's so embarrassing.

And I got obsessed.

It's so silly.

I'm so sorry.

I meant what I said before.

It really is part of your charm.

Truly.

I got you a bit of
an early Christmas present...

More of a re-gift.

Are these my old stories?

Yeah.

"He held onto them,"
she thought,

"even when I was ready
to let them go."

ine.

My old stories?

What, you actually kept these?

Yeah. Yeah. I found them
while I was packing.

I... I thought your dad

would want you
to have those back.

I'm speechless.

Thank you.

Wow.

Are those your stories, Talia?

Oh.

I get it.

I've gotten it wrong
this whole time.

I kept thinking

that my dad's greatest fear

was that I wouldn't become
some big, fancy author.

But his greatest fear

was that I would become stuck,

which is exactly what happened.

I have been
in this holding pattern

since he passed,

just so terrified.

I think because he was so young,

I've been afraid
to imagine my own future.

And I've let it hold me back
from so many opportunities.

I am a writer.

This I know.

It is my calling,

it is in my bones,

it is in my heart.

I'm not questioning that.
I am a writer.

But that's not
what this is about.

This is about my own fear.

I have been so afraid
to do what I love

or be with someone that I love

because what if
I lose them, too?

I am done living in fear.

I am done!

Do you hear me?

Looks like it worked, Mildred.

All part of your big plan.

I always believed in you.

That was...

I'm not done.
Okay.

Anderson...

I have feelings for you.

You keep me grounded,

you give me the space
to be exactly who I am...

and ever since we were kids,

you've always made me feel
like I'm special.

There's nobody
more special to me than you.

I have feelings for you, too.

Can you say that again?

I always have.

Your joie de vivre
puts a smile on my face.

And after spending
this time with you,

I can't imagine
my life without you.

Shouldn't you be resting?

Didn't want to miss all the fun.

And besides,
I have a proposition.

I don't know
what happened last night...

And that doesn't matter.

What matters is that I know you.

I want to stay in Wunderbrook.

Indefinitely.

If you'll allow me?

You do?

I do.

Well, I mean,

I guess I could get used
to having you around.

Besides, you're pretty cute.

Nobody has ever asked us
to stay before.

This is unprecedented.

We'll have to consider
all the ramifications...

Stay, Charles.

We know you'll make

the perfect addition
to our ranks.

So, does this mean

we get to tell everybody
about everything now?

Tell us about what?

Okay, I think I need a minute
to process this.

That makes two of us.

So, you all aren't
making this up

to humor me for some reason?

I knew it!

I knew it wasn't
just my imagination.

So, I'm actually
inside a magical world?

So, you're
the king and the queen?

And the freckled princess?

And the witch and the fool.

No offense.

Hey, someone's gotta do it.

So, my dad came here

in time
of his own inner conflict...

and that's why he gave me
his copy of Wunderbrook.

In case you needed it some day.

This is so incredible.

You all are going to help

so many people
for generations to come.

Maybe not.

Why would you ever stop?

We won't.

But the popularity of
A Wunderbrook Christmas Story

is waning more and more
each year.

It's only a matter of time
before people stop showing up.

But hey, why be so maudlin?

We had a successful group
this year,

and just in the nick of time,

so tonight, let's celebrate.

Everyone, get out there
and enjoy this...

Night of Wunder!

We insist!

So...

so where were we?

I can't really recall.

Maybe I need to borrow
some of Miles' mistletoe stash?

I don't think
we're going to need any.

You were right, you know.

About Wunderbrook?

No. About kismet.

And as this year's story

comes to an end,

the fate of Wunderbrook's future
has also been secured,

thanks to a new best-seller.

I knew you had it in you, Tal.

We all did.

Congratulations, Talia.

You did amazing.

Almost ready for your speech?

I gotta get back
to the hospital soon.

Ready as I'll ever be.

Hey, you look familiar.

Nope, nope,
not doing that again.

I hope you've found

everything you were
looking for, sir.

I'm quite sure I have,
thank you.

Now my part of the tale

has come
to its happy conclusion,

for I, too,

have fulfilled my destiny
of passing on my story.

Good afternoon.

Thank you so much for coming
to this book launch...

Who's that guy, Miss Talia?

Oh, that is Wunderbrook's
newest resident...

The noble knight.

Here, this copy is for you.
