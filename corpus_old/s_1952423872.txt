Sorry.

It's going to be okay.

Just don't think
about it.

Yeah.

I just hate hospitals.

Dang it.
What?

I left my book
at the house.

You know, in case
we have to wait.

Shoot! Um...

I'll look in my purse.

You rock.

You left it
on the table.

Thank you.

Promise me you're not
gonna leave, all right?

You're not gonna take off
when they put me under.

I promise.

I would never leave.

Woman: Isn't that always
the way it works?

Man: You'd think you see somebody
with a crutch, they're gonna help 'em out.

Right, naturally.
Don't even hold the door.

All right, you stay there, please.
Give me one moment.

I can at least
get out.

Let me just
get the crutch.

Wait, wait.

I can just stand.
Come on.

The brace.

You're awesome.

I love you. Be careful.
Love you. Thank you.

I'll be right up.
All right.

Woman #2: What's this I hear
about you taking the morning off?

Woman: Kevin has
orthopedic surgery today.

Aww! You're such
a good girlfriend.

I told you about it.
He's always there for me.

He's amazing.

I think the bank could
go one day without me.

You don't mind
covering, right?

Of course.
Of course.

So when do I get
to meet him?

I don't know.
It's been fours months.

I'm back. I wanna meet him.
I know.

I just have never been
in a relationship before

where it's
actually going well.

How can I help you?
Hi, where's outpatient surgery?

Squeezed you in under the wire, huh?
What do you mean?

We're shutting down
for renovations on Saturday.

Most of our patients have already
been moved to County West.

Oh.
Go through those doors

and take the elevator up.

Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

Tell him we'll give him
an extra basis point.

If he's worried
about the rates

and us not being
competitive,

tell him to just look
at our rates.

Listen, Craig's
been on this case.

Just have him deal
with it.

If you have any questions,
call Craig.

Okay, bye.

Hi.

Hey, baby.
Any trouble parking?

No, but I did finally speak
with Christine,

who wants us all

to grab a pizza
this weekend.

Her words.

All of us.

The best friend that I never get to meet?
Yes.

That's a biggie.

"Heart disease?" No.
"Rheumatic fever?" No.

"Snoring?"
Sometimes.

Really?
Yeah.

So you're sure you're okay
with this whole introduction thing

to your friends?
That's a big step.

No.

Every time I introduce
her to anybody,

it's sort of bad luck.

Well, don't you worry.

Because you are
not gonna lose me.

Ever.

"Social Security number"?

I've been having the hardest time
writing on this.

Oh, here, lean on this.

Ahh. Thank you.

So you must be
Kevin Peterson.

I am.
I'm Amanda.

Hi.
Hi, I'm Mary.

Hi, nice to meet you.

Dr. Harding will be in in a moment
so I just wanna check some things out.

Okay.

It's all done.
Thank you.

Does your wife
mind waiting outside?

Oh, well,
we're not married.

I don't mind.

Do you have a place
I could grab a coffee?

We have a cafeteria attached
to the lobby downstairs.

Perfect. Thank you.
You gonna be okay?

Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.
Don't leave me though, right?

Promise?
I promise.

Cross my heart, promise.

Okay.

You take care of him.

Oh, how long
will it be?

About an hour.
An hour? Really?

Yep.
Well, good luck.

Thank you.

See you in an hour.

Just tell him that he has to sign
the request form in person.

Yeah, he has to come in.

He already knows that.
Just do it.

I'll tell him
if I have to.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Let him know I'll call
him back this afternoon.

I'll call you back,
bye.

Let me please.
Thank you.

Sorry.
There's a garbage...

Yeah.
Right there and another one.

Oh, thanks a lot.

I'm Cooper, by the way.
Cooper, I'm Mary.

Mary.
Pleasure to meet you.

You want some company?
Sure.

Well, okay.

So what are you-

What am I in for?
I wasn't going to say it quite like that,

but yes.

My wife,
she has breast cancer,

and well,
she's up in chemo.

How's it going?
I'm sorry.

Small improvement.
We're keeping our fingers crossed.

So we'll see what happens.
I'm sorry.

What about you? You're not here
for the coffee, right?

I'm just here
for the day.

My boyfriend's having
orthopedic surgery.

He tore his A.C.L.

hiking and flared up
an old football injury.

He hurt himself, huh?

Yep. Keep telling him
to take it easy.

You don't like
hospitals, do you?

Does anybody like hospitals?

Except for the doctors
and nurses?

I've been doing this
every week for six months.

And I can't wait till
they shut this place down.

Believe you me.
Sorry.

Wow, look at you go.

It's my job.

MIT said that 90% of people
who use smartphones

feel more stress.

Only 90%?

I mean, look at you. You're sitting
in a hospital waiting for your boyfriend,

and you're working.

What happened to the days
where you could say,

"I'm out of the office,"
you know?

Well, sir,
to the good old days.

Cheers, Mary.
Cheers.

Kevin.

Man over P.A.: Monica Hernandez,
your party is ready in post-op.

Jeanette Stevens,
Mary Turner,

your parties are ready.

May I help you?
Yes, please.

Hi. My boyfriend
was having surgery,

and I just want to see
how much longer it's going to be.

Certainly.
What was his name?

Peterson- Kevin Peterson.

You're sure?
How are you spelling it?

P-e-t-e-r...

s-o-n. Peterson.
Peterson with an "O."

I'm not showing anyone
in our system with that name.

Okay, well, he's definitely
having surgery.

Do you happen to-
Orthopedics.

Do you happen
to remember the room number?

Yeah, it was right down the hall,
actually. This floor.

What about the doctor's name?
Room 714.

Harding.
Dr. Harding.

Dr. Harding's off today.

I'm sorry.

There's no one
in our system

with the name
Kevin Peterson.

Well...

Are you sure it could have
been in this hospital?

Perhaps it was
in another hospital.

We've stopped doing
outpatient procedures at this time.

Okay, I was here.

We drove together.

During pre-op,
I was in the room with him.

Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
What was the nurse's name?

No, what was her name?
Amanda.

Amanda.

Do you know her?
Doesn't ring a bell.

Okay. Maybe orthopedics
she's in.

Are you sure that he just
didn't leave without you?

I have the keys.
I have the keys to the car.

Okay? I just wanna know
where my boyfriend is.

Can you please help
me find him? Thanks.

I'm sorry.
He's not in our systems.

This is ridiculous.

Would you like me
to page him for you?

Thank you.
That would be great.

Kevin Peterson,
can you please dial 9

and come
to the courtesy phone?

Kevin Peterson,
please dial 9.

Kevin Peterson, please dial 9
at the courtesy phone.

Hey, this is Kevin.
Do your business after the beep.

Sweetheart.

Ma'am, you cannot use
your cell phone.

I'll be two seconds.
You cannot use your cell phone.

I have this nurse that's driving me
absolutely crazy.

I'm at the nurses' station
on the floor that had a room-

714 was on the last
place I saw you.

Right now it is-
it's definitely been over an hour.

I can tell you that much.
It's been hours,

and I've looked everywhere.
I can't find you.

The second you get this message,
okay, you call me.

Okay, baby.

You call me, okay?
Love you. I love you.

Hi, we met this morning.

You told me where

to check in
for outpatient surgery.

Kevin Peterson is
a patient here.

His doctor is Dr. Harding.
Okay.

He is my boyfriend.
I can't find him anywhere.

Do you remember me from earlier?
I remember you.

You were by yourself.
I was.

I dropped him off
in the parking structure, okay.

I don't make mix-ups,

and my computer is giving me
the correct information.

And there is no
Kevin Peterson.

Perhaps it's new information,
or something's changed.

I'm looking at my computer printout
and I don't see a Kevin Peterson.

I heard you. Okay.
Thank you.

Excuse me.
Yes, can I help you?

Yes, please. I'm looking
for someone who's missing.

Missing
He's 35,

6'1", dark hair,
dark eyes.

I haven't seen anybody
by that description. I'm sorry.

He's wearing a brace
on his left leg.

Are you okay?

Ma'am, are you okay?

Excuse me.

Yeah, this is Holloway
in the lobby.

Yeah, I've got a young woman
who's looking

for an unidentified male.

Hi, I'm looking
for a patient

that's in recovery
named Kevin Peterson.

Never heard of him.

Thank you.

Hi.
Hi, excuse me. Can I help you?

Hi, yes, I am looking
for Kevin Peterson,

Dr. Harding's patient.

Great, I understand.
This is a restricted area.

I think he's just back there.
I understand, ma'am,

but I need you to leave
the restricted area.

He is an outpatient.
He's recovering.

This is recovery.

Excuse me,
excuse me. Hi.

I'm sorry.
I'm very busy right now. I'm very sorry.

Okay.

Hi.
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm with a patient.

Look, ma'am, I really need you
to get out of this area.

Security, can you
take her away, please?

Ma'am, this is
a restricted area.

Ma'am, I'm sorry. This is a restricted area.
You have to leave.

Can you please escort me
to Dr. Harding instead?

Yes. You have to
get out of here.

It's a restricted area.

This is her.

And this is Miss Markham,
our hospital administrator.

Thank you. Hi, thank God.
How can I help you?

I'm Mary Walsh. My boyfriend
had surgery here this morning.

He's missing.
Missing?

Yes.
I told her there was no one

who's checked into this hospital
by the name of Kevin Peterson.

Okay, well, he had
orthopedic surgery-

A.C.L.- this morning.

His doctor
is Dr. Harding.

Evidently, neither one
of them are in your system.

And no one's in his room.

Okay, well, obviously there's been
some kind of mistake.

That's what I've been trying
to explain to you.

Come with me, please.
Let me see what we can do.

What time this morning was it that you
and your boyfriend arrived?

About 7:15.
Surgery started at 8:00.

Okay, and you're the one

who arrived here with him.
Correct.

Okay.

Oh...
Rewind that a hair.

Wait, stop.

All right,
these numbers don't-

These times don't coincide.

Keep fast-forwarding,
please.

We weren't even out
of bed yet.

Okay, keep going.

Okay, right here.

We were already here.

Back it up, please.

Okay, now...

rewind it just a hair.

Wait, wait.

Wait, did you see that?

Turn it back.

Go back a bit.
Play it from this point.

Good.

Keep playing, please.

Pause! That's him.

Right there.

That's him.

He's wearing the green
and gray striped shirt.

Color accuracy is difficult to determine
on closed-circuit cameras.

You've gotta be kidding me.
That's him. He's right there.

Markham: Miss Walsh.

Mary:
I'm looking at him, you know?

He may not be in your computer,
but he's right on your security camera.

Do you have a copy of his hospital
appointment record?

No, it was on him.

Oh God.

It might be in his
computer bag in the car.

I will have my team
look for him,

but you know I'm understaffed.
Yeah.

Where do you think
you're going?

I'm gonna go call somebody who
can actually help me out here.

I just didn't think there was
anything conclusive on that.

Do what you can,
but...

You got it, Miss Markham.
Thank you.

Yeah, come in.

Man: Breathe in...

...out, in...

out.

How is it, Doc?
It's 160 over 100.

You still taking
the medication?

Every day.

What about work?
What about it?

I don't know, Rich.

Something like this
takes time.

You don't wanna rush it.

Heaven forbid.

I'm gonna increase the dosage though.
Okay, thanks.

But I really need you
to take it easy, man.

Whatever you say, Doc.

All right.
See you on Thursday?

Wouldn't miss it.
All right, take care.

Franklin here.
Woman: This is dispatch.

We've got reports of a missing person
at County Memorial.

Are you still there?
Yeah, I'm still here.

What floor?

Mary: When I arrived,
he wasn't in his room.

So I went down
to the waiting room

and waited there
for a good couple of hours.

Started getting
increasingly concerned

and went back to his floor
and spoke with the head nurse

and learned for the first time
that he was not in the computer system.

We have looked. No one by the name
of Kevin Peterson was scheduled

for anything today,
not even a check-up.

What about the nurse,
this Amanda?

We don't have anyone
on staff by that name,

and the doctor that he was supposedly-
Dr. Harding.

scheduled with
is on vacation.

Look, if you could just access Kevin's
insurance records.

I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

Why?

The insurance company will
only release information

to the policyholder's
spouse.

Okay, but this is an emergency situation.
He's missing.

I'm sorry. The hospital
can't release any information

to a non-family member
without a court order.

Detective...

I'm getting
really really worried

that something bad's
happened to him.

Can you please help me?

Okay, first of all,

I can't file a report
for 24 hours.

24 hours?

I'll be honest with you,
Miss Walsh,

most of the time we get
a call saying a spouse

or boyfriend or whatever
is missing,

usually they just up
and left.

Have you considered
the possibility

that your boyfriend
might have walked out on you?

I could see how you two
would think that,

but that's just
not him, no.

How long have you been together?
Four months.

Markham: That's not a lot of time
to get to know someone.

Maybe your relationship
isn't what you thought it was.

No, I trust him.

Detective Franklin:
Do you have a picture?

Maybe, wait.

I think.
Hold on, I think I do.

Yeah, right here.

Can you make
anything out?

Markham:
No.

Well, it's not
the best picture.

It's something.

How about a description?

He's 6'0",
maybe 6'1".

Around 190.

Brown hair.

Brown eyes.

He was wearing
a green

and gray shirt today
and shorts

because he has
on a huge leg brace.

And he was using a crutch.

Shirt was
long-sleeved.

Security has their people
searching the entire hospital

and no one has seen anyone
matching that description.

I'll see
what I can find.

In the meantime,
I need you to sit right here.

I feel very awkward

just not doing anything
and staying here.

Miss Walsh, the more cooperation
I can get from you,

the faster this can go
for everyone.

All right? Okay?

Okay.
Thank you.

Thank you.

If you hear anything,
give me a call.

Anything I can do to help.
Thank you.

Thank you.

I'm sorry.
Me too.

Will you excuse me
for a minute?

Yes, of course.

Have you seen a male Caucasian,
mid 30s, dark hair,

wearing dark shorts,
green sweatshirt?

Excuse me, you wouldn't happen
to recall seeing a male Caucasian mid 30s,

wearing a gray-striped
hoodie with shorts?

No.
Okay, thank you.

Could you tell me where
the outpatient surgery is?

Yeah, if you just keep going
straight down the hall

you'll run right into it.

Woman:
Can I help you, sir?

Yeah, I couldn't help
but notice

there are no patients
on this level.

Yeah, everyone's been moved
to another facility.

They are shutting this entire hospital down
Saturday for renovation.

You mean no one has been
in any of these rooms today?

No. Are you looking
for someone?

I'm fine, thanks.

You wouldn't happen
to know

of a nurse named Amanda,
would you?

Amanda? No.

No, no one.
Are you sure?

I'm the head nurse.
I would know.

Thanks.
Have a good day.

Franklin: Excuse me, I'm looking
for a patient by the name

of Kevin Peterson...

Excuse me,
I'm looking for a guy,

mid 30s, 6' tall-
Kevin Peterson.

He's wearing
a striped hoodie.

You wouldn't happen to recall
seeing a male Caucasian, mid 30s,

wearing a gray-striped
hoodie with shorts?

Woman: No.
Kevin Peterson checked in, mid 30s.

I'm looking for a patient
by the name of Kevin Peterson...

By the name of Kevin Peterson...
Kevin Peterson, checked in today.

Gray-striped hoodie with shorts...
Woman: No.

Woman: Look, I just clock in
and I clock out.

You do not recall hearing the name
Kevin Peterson today? Is that right?

Woman: No.

Mary: Chris, I'm in the security room
at the hospital.

I took Kevin in
and he's missing.

Look, slow down, okay?
You're scaring me.

What's going on?
Nobody just disappears.

No, he is missing.

I haven't seen him since the surgery.
I feel like I'm going crazy.

What are you
talking about?

Saw him in pre-op. Boom,
went back to the room, gone.

He's not even in the computer system.
He's missing.

Okay, sweetie, you know,
you just met Kevin.

Maybe...

He didn't leave me,
honey.

Oh my God, sweetheart.
I'm not saying that he left you.

I know we've only been
together for four months,

but I have been waiting for him
my whole entire life.

And I'm not gonna let someone
take him away from me.

Okay, do you want me to come there?
What do you want me to do?

Do you want me to call the police?
You're scaring me.

No, I already called the police.
That's why the detective's here.

I think I hear
somebody coming.

Everybody's acting really strange.

There's something
real off here.

I think they're all crazy.
Or I'm the crazy one.

So please, please,
just keep checking in.

If I don't answer,
come find me, okay?

I'm having the hardest time
writing on this.

Oh, here, lean on this.

Ahh. Thank you.

So what's going on?
What's going on? Well, Miss Walsh,

Detective Franklin is out
looking for your boyfriend.

It's been over an hour.

It's a big hospital.

You know, I think
I'm gonna look myself.

Listen, I can't
have you doing that.

I can't have you walking around
the hallway scaring other patients.

Do you understand?

Hi.
I've been to all seven floors

and not a single person
has seen him.

Okay, um...

Then please,
I have to file a report.

I told you he needs to be
missing for 24 hours.

24 hours is too long.
Anything can happen in 24 hours.

Please, file a report.

What does Kevin do
for a living?

He's in insurance.

Well, at least
he's covered.

Have you ever been to his office?
Meet any of his colleagues?

No, he's freelance.
He works from the house.

But I did,
while you were gone,

jot this down for you.

Wait, you just happened
to remember it?

I'd appreciate it
if you ran it.

I'll see
what I can do.

In the meantime, is there anybody
else I could talk to?

Anybody who knew
he'd be here today?

What about family?
Ooh! His mother.

She lives in Florida,

but he was gonna put her number
into my phone in case of an emergency.

I just totally forgot.

Thank you.

Okay.

Wait.

The number you have reached
is not in service at this time.

There is no new number.
No luck.

He must have input
a wrong digit.

He's always been bad
electronically.

Shoot!

You need proof.
You need some sort of evidence

that this is real,
that he actually exists,

don't you?

Antidepressants.
I, uh-

I have a prescription
for that, so...

Holloway: That kind of
says it all, doesn't it?

Please hand that to me.

I'll be right back,
Mr. Holloway.

Where are you going?

May I have
my medication back, please?

Detective Franklin,

we have people here
she can talk to.

I'm sure Miss Markham
could arrange something.

All right, I'll run
the Social. I'll be back.

You got it.

Come on.

Wait wait.
Just stay out of the way.

Come on.
Your brace.

Do you want your bag?

No, just leave it
in the back. That's fine.

Thank God.

Where is it?

Okay, wanna come
upstairs now?

Shoot!

Holloway:
It's not under the seat.

Shoot!

Wanna come upstairs now?

It's not here.
What's not here?

His bag. It has
his computer in it,

all of his information-
everything.

Somebody had to have
gotten into the car.

What makes you think that?

Because the bag was here
this morning. Now it's not.

It was right there.
Miss Walsh, we need to speak with you.

Now.

I have the only set of keys.

Now.

We're in the middle
of a huge transition.

I've got patients to move,
equipment to transport.

Every minute that I
or my security team

spends chasing phantoms
on surveillance cameras

or finding you trespassing
in a restricted area is one less minute

we're able to do our jobs.

Every minute you don't spending
looking for Kevin is a minute wasted.

Mary, I checked seven
floors of this building.

I checked with every
nurse's station.

I checked the emergency room.
I checked the intensive care ward.

What about the wing
that's being renovated?

Franklin: Yes.

And?
And no one

reported seeing
your boyfriend.

No one can even confirm that
he was in this hospital.

Just what do you suppose
happened to him?

I don't know.
Holloway: Look, there are 23 exits

in this facility.
Six are manned by my men.

Eight are alarmed and the rest are
carefully monitored by cameras.

If anyone left this building

under any manner
of duress

we would know about it.

Well, obviously, you're not
looking hard enough.

Detective...
Detective Franklin.

Detective, who is it?
Really?

Okay, thank you.

What did they say?

We ran the Social Security number
you gave me.

Good, okay,
what's the next step?

It belongs to a 50-year-old
African-American woman.

Well, that's obviously
a mistake.

Not ours.

I ran the number
you gave us.

No, that's impossible.

Okay, run them
again, please?

Dr. Bensley,
thank you for joining us.

I'd like to introduce you
to someone.

Hello, Mary.
Hello.

Markham: Dr. Bensley is our
hospital psychiatrist.

I don't need
a psychiatrist.

Did you get the prescription
I sent over?

I did. Quite a
potent dosage, Mary.

Would you mind coming
with me for a moment?

Yes, actually, I would.

It doesn't need to be
voluntary, Miss Walsh.

Excuse me.
Excuse me!

Right this way, please.

This way.

Okay.
Come on.

So you've been treated for psychiatric
issues before, hmm, Mary?

Answer the question,
Miss Walsh.

I...

I checked myself in
when I was 22.

I was in grad school.
I was under a lot of stress.

I was there for three days.
That's it.

I don't see how
that's relevant.

What are you doing
on antidepressants?

Oh, you think
I'm making this up.

You think that,

what, my imaginary
boyfriend went missing?

You're an only child.

Your father left
when you were young.

Your mother died
earlier this year

in a hospital.

Yes, February.

She went in
for a routine check-up

and never checked out.

She had a blood infection.

So it's not surprising
that your subconscious

would choose a hospital
to fabricate-

It's not my subconscious
anything.

Oh my Lord!

This is real.

He was there for me.

You know, I remember
her funeral.

He was at it.
Kevin?

Yes, Kevin.

I know it's hard to lose somebody
you care deeply about, Mary.

It's very understandable
how someone in your situation

could suffer
a psychological break.

You work long hours.

You've lost your emotional
support system. You're alone.

It's only natural for the brain
to reach for something,

anything, to grab onto.

He drove us here.

He did.

And I remember the ride
like the back of my hand.

He- he- he was-

He was chewing on the lid
of his coffee cup.

It's this little nervous habit that he has.
Sorry.

I know that it all
must seem real.

It seems real
because it is real!

I remember walking through
the parking structure.

Memory is a very vivid
and powerful sensation, Mary.

It is real!

This whole situation
is real.

And he's here.
He was here,

He's somewhere
right now in this hospital

and we're wasting time!

The nurse advised me
to get coffee,

said the surgery
would be an hour.

It was 25 minutes,
and he's gone.

It was real.

It's all right, Mary.

Can I just have
a moment alone?

Take all the time
you need, dear.

I'll be in my office
next door.

Okay.

Mary, I-

Security.

Want some company?

Do you know I was just here
for a checkup today?

Doctor told me I need
to take it easy.

Then you call.

I gotta tell you, this job can really
take its toll on you-

your health,
your marriage.

You're married?

Was.

Marriage, it can be
a funny thing, you know?

You commit yourself,
you hand your heart over to someone,

but it always seems like
it's the little things

that keep
chipping away at it-

Little disagreements.

She-

she hated the fact
that I was a cop.

And you know what?

Maybe-
maybe she was right.

I don't know.

I was working a gang shooting
over in Glassell Park,

and my partner and I,

we traced the shooter back
to his girlfriend's house.

He'd been shacking up there
for a couple of weeks.

And we had the kid cornered,
so we went in.

He was unarmed,
gave himself right up.

What we didn't know that his girlfriend
was in the house.

The last thing I remember
before I blacked out...

was watching my partner...

his dark lifeless eyes

as he fell to the floor.

Now look at me.

I've got a desk job
and high blood pressure

and a doctor telling me
how to live my life.

What I'm-

what I'm trying
to say here is that...

I understand what
you're going through.

Can you please tell
Dr. Bensley

that...

he can just do whatever needs to do,
all right?

Mary's behavior
is definitely indicative

of someone in the midst
of an emotional breakdown.

And yet I never met anyone
with such conviction

in her delusion.

She absolutely believes that everything
that's happening is real.

She's emotionally lost.

Yeah, this Bensley.

Listen, I wanna put Mary Walsh
under 72-hour observation.

Mm-hmm.
Possible mental illness.

Mr. Holloway,
this is J.J.

I have her
in the hallway.

Switching to camera 2.

I'm following her
along the hallway.

I have her.
Do not lose her.

Sir, it looks like she's heading towards
sublevel "B"- boiler room and laundry.

We only have limited
coverage down there.

I'm en route right now.

Dr. Bensley, what are
we dealing with here?

Is she dangerous?

It's impossible to say.

Acute perception
of persecution, paranoia.

You just never know
how someone like this will act

when pushed too far.

No, no.
No cameras, none.

No parking lot.
No exits.

No. I can't find
her anywhere.

We only got a couple of cameras
operational in that area,

so it's not gonna be easy.
I'm gonna keep on scanning.

Wait, I think
I've got something.

Boom! Camera 4 in the boiler room.
She's wearing blue scrubs.

It looks like she's heading
towards the morgue.

She's running. She's on the move.
I'm gonna lose her.

You had a chance to talk with her.
Is she currently on meds?

Yeah, quite
a potent dosage.

Okay, so this could be some sort
of psychotic reaction.

It could indeed.

Hello.

Kevin:
Hello, it's me.

My God, Kevin.

Where are you?

I don't know.
Somewhere in the hospital.

What's happening?

Listen to me, okay?

Don't trust anyone.

I don't know how many people
are involved in this.

It's very important,
okay?

What do they want?
I don't know.

She has to be close by.
She couldn't have gone too far.

Check all the rooms
on that wing.

Look around you. Where are you?
Where are you right now?

I'm in a bathroom
somewhere.

Are you okay?
Are you safe?

Where are you?

I don't- hold on.

Um...

I'm in the morgue.

Can you get down here?
No, no! Leave me alone!

Kevin.

Kevin. Kevin!

Kevin.

Miss Walsh.

Miss Walsh, you in here?

I got her. She's heading
towards the parking garage.

Oh my God! Oh my God!
Are you all right?

Are you all right?

This is a first date.

We don't kiss on the first date.
Third. Fifth date.

Gonna wait?
This could take awhile.

I think I've done
all I can do.

Sorry she sent you
on such a wild goose chase.

Yeah, it happens.

Good afternoon, Doc.
Detective.

Cooper: Hi, Mary.

Hello.
Shh.

I heard what happened.
These are for you.

Hey, it's gonna be okay.

The doctor thought you needed
some more time to recuperate.

The cop- I think
he might have left.

Thank you.

They think I'm crazy.

I'm not.

I'm not crazy.

No, you're not crazy.
That's why I came down here.

I want to discuss the situation
about Kevin

and how you could
see him again.

You do wanna see
him again, right?

Do you know
where he is?

Now don't get yourself
worked up, young lady.

You did make quite a spectacle
of yourself, Miss Walsh.

The emotional outburst,
the panicking.

We expected that,
but the accident.

Oh, my my, Mary, I mean,
you've got to be more careful.

"Mary Catherine Walsh, unmarried,
regional operations manager

for the Empyrean
International Bank. "

You rent a condo in Reseda.
Your mother died four months ago,

but the bank got your house
in the reverse mortgage.

That's true.

How do you know this?
I did my research.

But your bank,
on the other hand,

recently received
from the federal government

a $2 billion bailout.

Now I've seen
the bonus structure,

rewarding
their executives

while letting their customers
go bankrupt, huh?

And you have access
to unlimited funds.

Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him!

So...

How much?
$10 million.

I've taken the liberty
to get Kevin's computer.

Inside here you'll find the account
and wire routing numbers

of a bank account
in the Cayman Islands.

Once I receive confirmation
of funds received,

I'll let your boyfriend go.

Shit.

I have no Wi-Fi signal.

I checked it myself.
It's fine.

Yeah, I don't have a wireless signal
in this room.

I need a hard line.

I need to move
to a different location.

Yeah, it's me.

Yeah, cut off
Peterson's finger.

No, wait! Wait!
Tell him no.

Look at this right here.

This is our signal.
There is none.

I've tried every
single network,

and there's nothing.
Hold that for one second.

I need you to move me
to a place

where I can plug in
a different computer.

I can get it done
in no time, okay?

Yeah, all right.

I've got 26 minutes till the cutoff,
which is exactly how much time

you've got to find a computer
to get me my money.

You're being watched.
We know everything you do.

If you fail, Kevin dies.

If you tell anyone,
Kevin dies.

If you leave the hospital,
Kevin dies.

Got it.

Here's your clothing.
I found it downstairs.

Meet me on sublevel "B"
when you're done.

Wonderful.

Miss Walsh?

Mr. Holloway, that crazy
Mary Walsh lady is back

wandering the halls.

She's looking for a patient
that does not appear to be in our system.

She needs be escorted
out immediately.

I'll alert Miss Markham.
Thank you.

We have footage of Miss Walsh
in the trauma recovery room.

J.J., punch up everything on level 3,
would you, please?

Thank you.
You got it.

Holloway: There you go.
I wanted somebody on that door.

Unfortunately,
the nurse stepped away.

You don't really think
she's dangerous, do you?

I'm not taking
any chances.

Besides, with her injuries,
her well-being is my responsibility.

Trust me. She's still here,
and we will find her.

I have my people turning
this place upside down.

Well, let me know the minute
you hear anything.

I'm going back upstairs.

You got it, Miss Markham.
Thank you.

$10 million.

$10 million.

Please work.

Hello.

Mary: Kevin.

Mary, Mary.
Oh, Kevin.

Are you hurt?

He's fine.

Let him go.

The receipt.
I need to email a confirmation code

to complete
the wire transfer.

So I would suggest
that you let him go now.

Move it!

Honey.

I thought I lost
you forever.

The code, come on!

Done.

Come on, let's go
up those stairs.

We could get away.
Just go right up those stairs.

Well, I'm glad
you made it safely.

I understand you're from Missouri.
Is that correct?

Yeah, Kansas City.

Is that near St. Louis?
Other side of the state.

Excuse me one second.

Royal Cayman Bank & Trust.
This is Barry.

Yeah, Conyers.
Yeah, it's me.

Did it go through?

Yes, sir. As a matter of fact,
it's pending right now.

We're on, guys.

Thank you, Miss Walsh.

Great work, baby.

I mean, fantastic.

Kevin: It's a good thing too.
Just in time,

'cause this brace is really starting
to make my leg really stiff.

Kevin,
what are you doing?

Cooper: Haven't you been paying any
attention? There is no Kevin Peterson.

Kevin.

Oh my God.
Where are you?

I don't know.
I'm in the hospital somewhere.

Can you get down here?

No, no, leave me alone!
Kevin.

There is no...

Kevin Peterson.

Kevin, Kevin!

Kevin.

Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him.

Oh, my.

So how much?

Franklin: What about the nurse,

this Amanda?

So you must be Kevin Peterson.
Yeah.

I'm Amanda.
Markham: We don't have anyone

by that name.
See you in an hour.

Mary: Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
What was the nurse's name?

Mary: Uh, no...
Amanda.

My boyfriend is Kevin Peterson...
Come here, come here.

...and we can't find him.

My wife,
she has breast cancer.

Well, she's up in chemo.

That's him
right there.

Color accuracy is difficult to determine
with closed-circuit cameras.

You know, Detective Franklin,
we have people here she can talk to.

I'm sure Miss Markham could
arrange something, if need be.

Mary:
Everything is a lie?

Everything
is a lie?

Every- every-
everything-

everything is a lie.
Don't take it personally, Mare.

Mare bear.
Don't touch me.

The man you fell
in love with...

he's not real.

I'm a real idiot.

Didn't he tell you about his time in prison?
That's where I met the guy.

Believe me, if I was any younger,
I would have done this myself.

No no no, Coop.
You couldn't handle her.

She's a real tiger cat
between the sheets.

Oh, I don't know, Coop.

I think you could
have handled her.

Holloway: All we had
to do was sit back

and watch you lose it.
It was simple.

Mare bear,
for old times' sake.

Come on in.
Don't you dare touch me.

Don't touch me.
Allow me.

Boys, I think
it's time to go.

All right, Holloway,
you know the drill.

Amanda.

I'll send you a postcard.

I'm sorry.

Victoria Markham's
office, please.

It's Detective Franklin.
Tell her it's urgent.

What do you mean she disappeared?
Where'd she go?

Look, I think she's telling us the truth
about her boyfriend.

She's messed up in something.
I don't know what it is.

I think she's in some kind of trouble.
Just find her.

Just find her!
I'm on my way there right now.

Whoo!

$10 million feels good,
doesn't it, babe?

Baby, gimme a kiss.

You know,
I almost feel bad.

Amanda:
Oh, yeah, why is that?

Almost, but I can think of
10 million reasons why not.

Come on! Up!

Get up those stairs.
Come on!

Don't fight me!

Yeah, you're a fighter,
ain't you?

I believe Stevie once said
you were an animal in bed.

Easy easy.

Shh!

Yeah.

Damn, you're fine.

I wanna show you something.

All right.
Yeah.

Maybe I shouldn't let
you go just yet.

What are you reaching
for down there?

It's my phone.
What about your phone?

The transfer.

You know they were talking
about the transfer?

Yeah, what about it?

It's still pending.

Really? You pulling another one
of your tiger moves?

Is that it?
I could take that money

and I could transfer it
right into your account

with just the click
of a button.

What do you mean
I could have the money?

I'll prove it to you.
I'll do it right here. Look.

Slowly, do it slowly.

Let me see. Oh!

Mary,
where's my little lamb?

Mary!
Where you at?

Holloway:
Mary!

Mary.

We got 23 exits.

We checked 22.

Really? You think
I did a good job?

Yes, you in the naughty
nurse's outfit

was
really something.

Thanks, baby.
I was so nervous.

Hey, look,
don't get too excited.

Give Holloway a call.
All right.

Kevin: Hello, Holloway.

Sounds like you're
out of breath.

Mare bear...

is that you?

I can hear you breathing.

And I know your breath.

Where's Holloway?

You didn't kill
Holloway, did you?

I didn't know
you had it in you.

Mary.

Mary, listen to me.

I'm coming for you, Mary.
I'm coming down there.

You just stay put, sweets.
We can sort this all out.

I'm coming for you.
Damn it!

Holloway screwed up.
She's not dead.

Just relax. I'll get the money, okay?
We'll get the money!

I thought you said
you knew this chick, Steve.

I do. I told you, she's smart.

Hello.
Barry: I'm afraid there's been a problem.

The wire's
been reversed.

Cooper:
What are you talking about?

The bank recalled
the money.

Can't do that.

It's not my call, sir.
That's not good enough.

Sir, there's nothing more
that I can do, okay?

It's not on my end.
I did what you told me to do.

I did what you asked me to do.
I'll get them to rescind it.

Sir, do whatever
you have to do, sir.

I'm sorry.

We gotta go back.
Get us back to the hospital.

I'll take care
of it myself.

I'll put a bullet
in her head right now.

Turn around here.

Son of a bitch!

There she is!

End of the road, baby.

All right, you take the wheel.
Meet us topside.

Woman:
All units, three armed suspects

spotted in hospital parking garage
driving silver sedan.

All units respond.

Shh shh shh.
Wait wait.

Where'd they go?
I don't know.

Where'd they go?
They went that way.

Chill out!
You stay right here.

You hear me?
Right here!

I need backup
at County Hospital now.

Mary honey,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

Mare bear.

No! No, don't hit her.
We need her information.

Honey, Mary.
He's sorry.

Mare.

Mary: Please stop!

Cooper, put the gun down.

You're a smart girl,
Walsh.

There's no good way out of this.
Don't be stupid.

I'm gonna put my gun down.

I'm gonna do it
right here.

I'll go my way.
You go yours, okay?

Drop your weapon,
Cooper.

Coop...

you okay?

Kevin:
Whoa whoa whoa!

Where'd you get a gun,
honey?

Put it away.
Stay where you are.

Whoa whoa whoa.
Baby, I'll put this away.

Take it easy.

This is a whole
different side of you

I've never seen.

And how do you feel
about that side?

I like it.

I like it a lot.

Me too.

Baby, this whole thing
has gotten completely

out of hand.

You were never
supposed to get hurt.

Okay?

Look,
we can work this out.

Okay, listen,

forget these guys, okay?

Why don't you and I
just take the money?

You can resend it.

We'll take it. We can be anybody
we wanna be.

We can go anywhere we wanna go.
Think about that.

No no no,
it started off about money,

but now, I mean,

honey,
everything's changed.

I would hate for you

to see four months

of wasted time
and effort.

I would really hate it.

It would hurt me.

Yeah, that's what
I'm saying.

So you and I, we could take
the money together.

Right here.

And it could happen
just with the push of a little button.

We can go
anywhere we want to.

We can be anybody
we want to.

Think about it.

Baby, that sounds
pretty fantastic.

You...

always told me
I was priceless.

Baby, you are priceless...

to me.

Just didn't know

that I was
a $10 million catch!

No!

Mary.

See now, I'm gonna have
to break up with you.

For real!

Mare!

Mary.
Mary, don't move.

Stay right there!
Don't move.

I'm gonna come to you.
You're okay.

Stay right there.

Okay.

I'm sorry.

Thank you.

Detective Franklin.
Mm-hmm.

Before we go up there

and see all those people,

I just wanted to ask,

why did you believe me?

This.

You left it in the chapel.

What about this?

The last chapter.
Take a look.

The whole thing,
it's right there.

Couldn't even come up
with something original.

Why don't you keep this
for evidence?

You gonna be okay?
Sure I am.

Gonna just keep on living

one day at a time.

How about you?
I called my wife.

You did?
You got me thinking.

Maybe I let her go
too easily.

I am proud of you, kid.

Come on. Let's get you
to a real hospital.

Okay?
Then the games can really begin.
