"DEAR MR. BARLOW,

"THE SMALL SIZE OF OUR STAFF

COMMENTS ON SUBMISSIONS.

"NEITHER THIS, NOR THE
RETURN OF YOUR MANUSCRIPT

"REFLECTS ON THE
QUALITY OF YOUR WORK.

"THANK YOU FOR THE SUBMISSIONS
AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUBMISSION.


YOU GOT SOME MAIL.

<i>HE SAID.</i>

<i>POLITE OF HIM NOT TO CALL
IT BATHROOM WALLPAPER.</i>

HEY, HOW THE HELL THEY
PULL THAT OFF, ANYWAY?

THESE REFUGEES.

THERE'S HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF THEM.

TAKE 'EM FROM HERE,
MOVE THEM OVER THERE.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW HARD
IT IS JUST TO GET 2 PEOPLE

TO AGREE TO DO THE SAME THING,

SHOW UP AT THE SAME PLACE.

HAVE THE SAME OBJECTIVE.

WELL, YEAH, OF COURSE YOU DO.

NO AMENDS MADE LAST NIGHT, HUH?

WOMEN.

YEAH.

JESUS CHRIST.

HIM, TOO.

YEAH.

YOU WANT A JOB?

I COULD USE A JOB.

I NEED SOME MONEY.

GOT A BIG HOUSE NEEDS PAINTING.

THANKS, MONROE.

VELMA SAID SOME OLD BOY
FLASHED HER AND MARILYN

OVER AT THE FOOD
WRANGLER THE OTHER DAY.

PULLED IT OUT WHERE
THEY WERE PARKED,

BY THE CHARITY CLOTHES DROP.


WHERE'S THE HARM?

JUST WHIPPED IT RIGHT ON OUT.

HOW BIG WAS IT?


YEAH, I ASKED THE SAME QUESTION.

VELMA SAID SHE DIDN'T
LOOK. BUT MARILYN...

COULD PICK IT OUT OF A LINEUP.

SAID IT WASN'T NO
BIGGER THAN AN ACORN.

WELL, YOU'RE THE BEST HOUSE
PAINTER I EVER SAW, BOBBY.

BUT YOU DON'T
REALLY LIKE IT, DO YOU?

SEE, I LOVE PAINTING.

I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

BUT I GOT NO TECHNIQUE.

OF COURSE, FRANCIS BACON SAID,

"IN PAINTING,

"YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, NOT HOW."

OF COURSE, HE COMMITTED SUICIDE.

DAMES GET A LOOK AT THE ACCUSED?

VELMA. MAKE, MODEL,
YEAR, COLOR, PLATE.

SHE'D HAVE GOTTEN HIS SHOE SIZE IF
HE HADN'T OF BOOKED OUT OF THERE.

CREAM-COLORED '78 CHEVY PICKUP.

HUH.

WITH A WHITE TAILGATE,
KIND OF LIKE A BUNNY.

SHIT. WE GOT HIM, NOW.

VELMA.

HELL, YEAH. SHE'S
THOROUGH AS A BY-GOD.

DON'T GET UP.

YOU SAY YOU GOT NO TECHNIQUE.

WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

THAT YOU DON'T THINK YOU'RE
ANY GOOD AT PAINTING, OR WHAT?

NOT THAT, SO MUCH.

I... I MEAN, I GOT NO TECHNIQUE

FOR GETTING UP IN THE
MORNING, EITHER, BUT HERE I AM.

YEAH, WHY IS THAT?

I MEAN, YOU'RE
SITTING ON FORT KNOX.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT
HERE, BREAKING YOUR BACK?


EVERYBODY'S GOTTEN A JIG
THEY GOTTA DANCE ABOUT WORK.

FORT KNOX, HARD
KNOCKS, PLAID SOCKS,

<i>WORK IS JUST WORK,
BROTHER, AND I THANK YOU.</i>


MR. AARON.

YES, SIR.

HEY. HEY.

WHAT YOU GOT TO
SAY FOR YOURSELVES?

I CAN'T THINK OF A THING.


YOU EVER HEAR OF THIS PLACE?

I CAN'T EVEN SAY IT.

WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

WELL, LOOKS LIKE A WAR
OF SOME KIND OR ANOTHER.

NOW, WHAT THE HELL DO THESE
PEOPLE GOT TO BE FIGHTING ABOUT?

DON'T HARDLY NEED
MUCH OF A REASON.

YOUR DADDY AND I HAD A REASON.

YOU AND MONROE DID, TOO.

"DID, TOO," WHAT?

TALKING ABOUT RE-ENLISTING.

SHOOTIN' SOME OF THEM
BOYS OVER THE SUB-SAHARA.

OH, RIGHT IN THE
SUB-SAHARA, HUH?

HOW'S YOUR LEG?

OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

MIGHT HAVE TO CUT THE DAMN
THING OFF AND GET RID OF IT.

DID YOU GET THEM WAY
BACK WHERE IT'S COOL?

YOU BOYS LOOK LIKE
YOU NEED SOME COOLIN'.

HEY, I PUT THIS ONE TO

WELL,

WE HAVE HAD A NICE LONG CHAT

ON THE PORCH HERE, HAVEN'T WE?

WE TALKED ABOUT THE
GARDEN CLUB MEETING

I HAD TO CANCEL,

ABOUT THE PHONE CALLS I
HAD TO MAKE TO CANCEL IT.

HOW MANY CALLS DID WE
MAKE ON THIS PHONE, ALAN?

12, MAMAW.

12.

AND AS THE SUN

WENT FROM A FRIENDLY-
MORNING SMILEY FACE OVER THERE

TO A HOT, ANGRY BLAZE UP THERE,

WE DISCUSSED THE SUMMER WEATHER

AND BEING HERE IN IT

WITH NEITHER A HOUSE
KEY NOR A DADDY IN SIGHT.

[Mrs. Barlow] WHAT
ELSE DID WE DISCUSS?

BIKES, MAMAW.

BIKES.

WE SAW A BICYCLE
RACE, RIGHT OUT HERE.

AND WE COUNTED
THEM AS THEY WENT BY.

ONE OF THE GROUPS OF CYCLISTS

WAS SO LARGE, WE LOST COUNT.

AND WE WONDERED, WHAT DO
YOU CALL A GROUP OF CYCLISTS?

A... A CLUSTER?

A HERD?

A GAGGLE.

PELOTON.

A PELOTON OF CYCLISTS.

YOU KNOW A WORD LIKE THAT,

AND YOU DON'T KNOW
THE MEANING OF "MORNING."

I'VE BEEN PRETTY BUSY.

AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO DO, GETTING THEM FED,

MAKING AN EMERGENCY
RUN TO THE DRUGSTORE.

EMERGENCY RUN?

NEVER MIND.

HOT, BLAZING SUN HALF THE DAY.

I SAID I WAS SORRY.

NO, YOU DIDN'T.

NOT A WHIFF OF IT.

I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

IS THAT YOUR MOTHER</i>

<i>BROUGHT THE KIDS TO YOUR HOUSE</i>

<i>AND SHE HAD TO

<i>CRAWLING OUT OF SOME

THIS IS THE FIRST NIGHT</i>

<i>THAT I'VE HAD TO
MYSELF IN 2 WEEKS?</i>

<i>HERE YOU ARE, CHATTING ME UP.</i>

YOU IN THE BATHTUB?

NO.

NO.

THAT'S JUST THE SOUND
OF YOU PISSING UP A ROPE.


WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER?

MARILYN?

UH, WELL, UH, IT'S

IT'S MORE LIKE A RECEPTION.

WE WENT OUT TO VEGAS TO
MAKE IT LEGAL ON THE CHEAP.

WELL, SHE DIDN'T WANT
HER OLD MAN PULLING

SOME CRAZY SHIT
DURING THE VOWS, AND

I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU
TO STAND UP WITH ME, BUT...

WHEN YOU'RE IN THE FUNERAL GAME,

FOR HER TO SEE A WEDDING

<i>"WANTS TO SEE THE
REST OF THE BOOK.</i>

<i>"IF IT'S ALL GENUINE BARLOW,</i>

<i>"YOU'RE OUT OF THE SLUSH
PILE. ARE YOU READY?"</i>

AM I READY?

<i>"CHEERS. BETTI D."</i>

â™ª [Tom Waits singing
<i>Long Way Home]</i>

<i>â™ª WELL, I STUMBLED
IN THE DARKNESS â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª LOST AND ALONE â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª THOUGH I SEEN HER GO BEFORE â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª SHOW THE WAY BACK HOME â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª IS THERE A LIGHT UP AHEAD? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª CAN'T HOLD ON VERY LONG â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª FORGIVE ME, PRETTY BABY â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª BUT I ALWAYS TAKE
THE LONG WAY HOME â™ª</i>

IT'S SOMETHING, AIN'T IT?

GET IN, I'LL TELL
YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

HE'S REALLY OUT OF IT.

YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO REPLACE
SOMETHING SO OLD AND BEAT-UP?

YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE.

A FEW DETAILS ARE OFF, BUT,

IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE
ORIGINAL TO BE A MINOR MIRACLE.

ISN'T IT, HONEY BOY?

HE WAS SO HYPER
ABOUT GOING FOR A DRIVE.

I HAD TO GIVE HIM AN EXTRA DOSE.

I MIGHT'VE OVERDONE IT.

OH, HEY, MY CAR'S BACK THAT WAY.

SLIDE OVER.

WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
ME WHERE I TELL YOU?

US THERE IN ONE PIECE.

[Velma chuckling]

[Pig squeals]

I THOUGHT WE'D TAKE A DRIVE OUT TO
THE BOULEVARD OF BROKEN HUMAN HEADS.

YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST
TIME WE COME OUT HERE?

NO.

I SWEAR, NOTHING'S REAL TO
YOU, EXCEPT WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD.

YOU GET RAPED IN JAIL?

MET A COUPLE OF NICE GUYS,
IT NEVER WENT ANYWHERE.


GUESS IT'S NOT
EXACTLY STATE PEN.

BUT YOU KNOW,

YOU EVER NOTICE HOW,

YOU KNOW, THERE HE IS?

YOU EVER HAVE A JOB HE DIDN'T GET
FOR YOU OR WORK RIGHT ALONGSIDE YOU?

EVEN PULPWOOD AND LUMBERJACKING.

BET YOU NEVER KNEW
HOW MUCH HE HATED THAT.

IF YOU'D HAVE JUST LET
HIM GIVE YOU A MILLION OR 2,

NEITHER ONE OF YOU WOULD
HAVE HAD TO WORK SO HARD.

COURSE NOW, HE MIGHT NOT
EVEN REMEMBER HE'S RICH.

YOU KNOW, HE'S MISSING
WHOLE CHUNKS OF HIS LIFE.

I KNOW HE REMEMBERS
THE WAR, 'CAUSE I QUIZ HIM.

BUT, YOU KNOW, HE MIGHT NOT
REMEMBER OWING HIS LIFE TO YOU.

NO. NO.

HE SAVED MY LIFE.

HALF OF ONE, 6 A
DOZEN THE OTHER.

I DON'T THINK HE'S
EVER COMING BACK.

I MEAN...

HE'LL PROBABLY BE
BETTER THAN HE IS NOW,

BUT IF HE WAS COMING
ALL THE WAY BACK,

HE'D BE WAY FARTHER
ALONG BY NOW.

IT'S ONLY PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM
BEFORE WILL REMEMBER THAT HE...

WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

THEN AFTER A WHILE,

WE WON'T REMEMBER EITHER.

IF...

OK, OK, HERE'S THE THING.

I... I CAN'T ASK NOBODY ELSE.

IT'S GOT TO BE YOU.

WHAT I REALLY WANT

IS FOR THE KIND OF MAN
HE WAS TO BE KNOWN.

WILL YOU TELL THE
STORIES? WRITE SOME THINGS,

SO THAT WE DON'T EVER FORGET.



<i>WE SAW HALF THE SHOW.</i>

COMES BACK TO YOU, DOESN'T IT?</i>

<i>â™ª WATER'S JUST SOAKING THROUGH â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª OFF THE BACK OF A TRAIN â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª THOUGHT WE'RE
HEADED FOR LIGHTENING â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª HAT FULL OF RAIN â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª AND I KNOW THAT I SAID â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'D NEVER DO IT AGAIN â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I LOVE YOU, PRETTY BABY, BUT I
ALWAYS TAKE THE LONG WAY HOME â™ª</i>

UP HERE BEFORE YOU SINK.

GOD, THIS IS HOW BEAT I AM.

I WENT OUT TO TAKE
THE LAUNDRY IN.

JUST LAID DOWN HERE.

I BEEN WATCHING THE STORM.

DO YOU THINK IT'S OVER?

YOU KNOW, YOUR BOY, HE WOULDN'T
SETTLE FOR A BOOK TONIGHT.

NO, HE WANTED A REAL STORY.

I TOLD HIM, "ALAN, YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO TELL ME ONE. I'M JUST OUT.

"MY BRAIN'S..."

SO HE STARTS RIGHT
IN, "ONCE UPON A TIME..."

AND THE NEXT THING I
KNOW, HE'S SHAKING ME.

HE SAYS, "YOU CAN'T FALL
ASLEEP YET. IT'S NOT OVER."

I OPEN MY EYES.

THAT COWBOY LAMP.

THE SHADE'S RIPPED. I'M
STARING RIGHT AT THE LIGHT BULB.

AND IT BLEW.

USUALLY IT'S WHEN YOU
FLIP THE SWITCH, BUT...

I'D NEVER SEEN ONE
JUST GIVE OUT LIKE THAT.

JUST A TINY LITTLE POP.

I COULD FEEL IT RIGHT
DOWN MY SPINE, LEON.

INTO MY BONES.

IT'S LIKE THAT CARTOON
LIGHT BULB, YOU KNOW?

ABOVE YOUR HEAD,
ONLY THIS ONE WENT OFF.

NO IDEA.

NO IDEA I COULD BE THIS TIRED.

NO IDEA ABOUT ANYTHING.

I JUST SAT THERE, AND HE TOLD
THE REST OF THE STORY IN THE DARK.

SOMETHING ABOUT...

OH, GOD, HE WORKED
IT IN JUST THE WAY YOU...

THE ARMY SHOT OUT
THE SUN WITH A BAZOOKA

OR SOME DAMN THING LIKE THAT.

JUST GOT UP AND CAME OUT HERE.

IT MUST BE LATE.

[Thunder claps]

I'LL LET YOU GO TO BED.


WHY'D YOU COME HERE?


SOME...

SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO ME, BUT, UH...

I FORGOT WHAT IT WAS.

[Thunder claps]

GOOD NIGHT.

[Tom Waits] <i>â™ª I'LL PUT
FOOD ON THE TABLE â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª AND A ROOF OVERHEAD â™ª</i>

ALL TOMORROW â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª FOR THE HIGHWAY INSTEAD â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª WATCH YOU BACK,

<i>â™ª ONE THING'S FOR

<i>â™ª I ALWAYS TAKE

WAS LEON, OR BARLOW,</i>

<i>OR ANY EPITHET THAT MIGHT APPLY.</i>

<i>LIKE A LOT OF WORDS, THE
NAME DIDN'T MEAN MUCH.</i>

<i>HE COULDN'T GET ANYONE
TO DO ANYTHING HE WANTED.</i>

<i>BUT AT LEAST HE
KNEW WHAT HE WANTED.</i>

<i>HE REMEMBERED WIND,
THE MUSIC IT MADE.</i>

<i>HE THOUGHT IT MUST SOUND
THE SAME IN HIS OWN LUNGS</i>

<i>RUSHING THROUGH THE
DARK CORRIDORS OF THE BODY.</i>

<i>HIS CURSE WAS REMEMBERING.</i>

<i>IT WAS ALSO A BLESSING.</i>

<i>THAT WAS EASY TO FORGET.</i>

<i>HE WAS SURE THAT
WHATEVER IT WAS,</i>

<i>BACK THERE IN THE DISTANCE,</i>

<i>IT COULD CHASE
ANYONE DOWN IN TIME.</i>

<i>NO ONE WOULD BE SPARED</i>

<i>AND FEW SPARED THE GRIEF</i>

<i>OF LOSING THOSE
WHO WOULD GO BEFORE.</i>

<i>THERE WAS NO BLAME, THEN,</i>

<i>TO LAY AT THE
FEET OF THE LIVING.</i>

POINT TO YOURSELF, YOU
GOT TO POINT TO YOURSELF,

SO HE KNOWS WHO
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

MONROE, WHY DO
YOU CALL HIM BOBBY?

WHY DOES HE CALL YOU BOBBY?

I DON'T KNOW, SON.

ONLY THE OLD STRUGGLE</i>

<i>TO HOLD ON OR TO LET GO.</i>

<i>THERE WAS ONLY THE
STORY OF THE LOST FAMILY</i>

<i>RUNNING ALONG IN
THE NIGHT STREETS,</i>

<i>RUNNING FOR HOME.</i>

<i>WHATEVER THEY WERE RUNNING FROM,</i>

<i>HE KNEW HE HAD TO
SAVE THEM FROM IT</i>

<i>AND THAT HE WAS THE
ONLY ONE WHO COULD.</i>

[Train chugging]

<i>THEY WERE RUNNING.</i>

<i>RUNNING.</i>

<i>RUNNING.</i>

<i>THE WIND WAS BLOWING</i>

<i>AND HE COULD FEEL
THE COLD NIGHT AIR.</i>

<i>HE COULD SEE THE ROAD.</i>

<i>TO FIND OUT WHERE IT LED,
HE HAD ONLY TO GO THERE.</i>

<i>AND HE RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD,</i>

<i>NOT KNOWING HOW IT WOULD END,</i>

<i>KNOWING HE HAD TO KNOW.</i>
