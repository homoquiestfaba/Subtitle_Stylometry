104 
You will say something

Usual, but this time, 
the incidence was 980 nanometers. 

185 
Alerts are sent 
through ERLAP or TINYTIM ... 

186 
The other machine takes 
the signal and there is communication. 

187 
Usually we take infrared 
Marks From the universe. Right? 

188 
This was different. 

189 
We believe, that I believe

273 
You have to say much 
you two. 

274 
The robots are coordinated with 
machine remote control. 

275 
And serve 
a common purpose. 

276 
We need to know 
what is that purpose. 

277 
You said the satellite 
plate was robots.

current machines. 

288 
We know, however, that

407 
Are you okay, I mean. 

408 
Yes, I think so. 

409 
Only I do not know 
what happened there. 

410 
Usually I say, 
when dancing with a girl. 

411 
X-orefeis with many? 
-Too many! 

412 
Thus explains the extraordinary 
Your dancing skills. 

413 
Give me a few minutes 
and will be hell to pay. 

414 
Will you set foot! 

415 
I had a platoon of men 
under my command. 

416 
We had a convoy 
out AP'TI Basri. 

417 
We have reached a turning 
street. 

418 
We threw a rocket 
a home. 

419 
He hit the ground 
just below us. 

420 
I said to my men 
to remain motionless ... 

421 
... and ran home. 

422 
'Acted very quickly. 
It was an ambush. 

423 
I went home and I was looking 
that we shot. 

424 
One group fired 
against my husband. 

425 
I heard the shots ... 

426 
... and I went out 
as fast as I could. 

427 
Until we get all 
my men were dead. 

428 
You did what you believed 
that is correct, right? 

429 
What is this? 

430 
Earthquake? 

431 
I think not. 
Better get dressed. 

432 
Jake, what happens? 

433 
Not stop the signal. 

434 
What do you mean? 

435 
They are coming machinery. 

436 
Stay here! 
'I am coming soon! 

437 
-Where did you get? 
-It is for''rainy day''. 

438 
Madison, come on! 

439 
Get in! 

440 
Go! Go! 
SUBrip-TIMING [GMTeam] 

441 
What happened, Joe? 
I think I won. 

442 
-It seems not. 
-What does that mean? 

443 
It destroyed the 
quickly. 

444 
Not our fault. 
Met their goal. 

445 
Do you see any military? 
No! 

446 
All systems and 
communications have been interrupted. 

447 
Networks, defense ... 
Off! 

448 
-We are our own. 
We got company! 

449 
-What is this? Push throttle, Joe! 
-I have sanidosei! 

450 
-You can run, Joe? 
-Try! 

451 
Saving! 

452 
-We must go from Town. 
-Go into the desert. 

453 
They have understood everything. 

454 
They took over the planet. 

455 
You're fine. 
Do courage. 

456 
Everything will be fine. 
You can do it. 

457 
Missed, right? 

458 
Everything will be fine. 
Do courage. 

459 
Over here! 

460 
Come get up. 

461 
Madison, get the gun. 

462 
Get into the van. 

463 
Let's get outta here. 

464 
-Go to Bannon. 
-Just get out of here. 

465 
-Jake will be okay? 
-Fine. 

466 
Lucy comes to help 
take care of 'Amy. 

467 
The 'Amy was my classmate. 
How? 

468 
Great. If physicians 
not had a pacemaker put ... 

469 
... would not be with us 
to see the end of the world. 

470 
We have to draw. 

471 
Bite them. 

472 
Count to three. 
Ready? 

473 
On three? 
Or as you say three? 

474 
1.2 and after I take. 
Okay? Ready? 

475 
One ... Two ... 

476 
Three ... 

477 
Quits! 
Almost came out, Joe! 

478 
You're fine. 

479 
Do courage, Joe. 
We will tie. 

480 
We will stop 
bleeding. 

481 
Hold it. 
Everything will be fine. 

482 
Everything will be fine. 

483 
-What is this place? 
-They destroyed my city. 

484 
The leveled. 

485 
We have refugee camps 
until you see what we do. 

486 
We are many. 'Men, 
women and children ... And families. 

487 
And if we find? 

488 
This will be done sooner or later. 
But expect the best. 

489 
We are prepared 
for the worst. 

490 
Th'aftoktonisoume. 

491 
If they are, will die 
on our own terms. 

492 
Do not be afraid. We carried - 
theimenoi. You will not come this far. 

493 
All you hungry? 

494 
Dr. Summers, what is the difference 
between aliens and Alien; 

495 
Good question. 
Thanks for the respect. 

496 
The best way 
to describe the ... 

497 
An alien attack 
as a friend. 

498 
Eventually, 
the conflict ... 

499 
wonder how ... 
would defeat. 

500 
This Alien attacked 
as an enemy. 

501 
And I could 
understand anything. 

502 
The aliens attack 
of defense. 

503 
The Alien attack without 
challenge ... Cold. 

504 
I think so. 
-Sorry about the beans. 

505 
When I was mayor paretheta 
the best meals. 

506 
Now, what is the canned. 

507 
Ate when I was 
student ... The love you! 

508 
You know why we are so 
''lucky''; Why us now? 

509 
-Why they came, Dr. Summers? 
-This is the big question. 

510 
For natural resources 
air, water ... 

511 
I saw something to put 
water. 

512 
Contaminate water. 

513 
We are destroying. 

514 
Mayor! 

515 
Something moves in the chest! 
My God! The pacemaker! 

516 
Only I see death. 

517 
It should be obvious as possible. 
We must survive. 

518 
Look ... Destroyed 
almost everything. 

519 
What next? 
Our water? 

520 
Not if we get 
first in the water. 

521 
What does this mean? 

522 
Our resources are getting less. 
Without water, you th'antexoume much. 

523 
We must survive. 

524 
Is it right ... If you get out alive 
in this invasion ... 

525 
... all the natural resources 
disappear. 

526 
You have a plan? 

527 
The aqueduct 
Los Angeles. 

528 
Come, have a job. 

529 
The water supply system 
of L. Angeles brings water ... 

530 
... the only, 
340 miles away ... 

531 
... and AP'TIN Valley-Owens, 
240 miles away. 

532 
-On entering the city? 
-From here. 

533 
Three separate sources of water. 
About 70% of drinking water. 

534 
-How far is it from here? 
-About three hours. 

535 
-We see, though. 
-We will follow the pipeline. 

536 
Goes south, From the Mojave. 

537 
You will have, of course, 
roof ... 

538 
When we come, 
how to destroy? 

539 
-How many have dynamite? 
-About two hundred. 

540 
Guns? 
We have a small arsenal. 

541 
We'll take what we have. 
The women will stay here. 

542 
If you want to stay with 
their families, you understand. 

543 
"I will come. 
-Me too. 

544 
-Joe, got injured. 
-A little hack is. 

545 
-You come too. 
-Are you sure? 

546 
The bastards killed her uncle 
me. You will lose nothing with. 

547 
We are seven. More, 
it attracted attention. 

548 
We'll go on foot. 
Low and fast. 

549 
We will be together. 

550 
Let's get ready. 

551 
Is that all? 

552 
-Joe, you know what? 
No, but I learn quickly. 

553 
Do not aim. 
Madison carefully. 

554 
Ready everyone? 
-If you're ready and you. 

555 
-How long is the pipeline? 
-Approximately 270 meters. 

556 
There is an opening right 
just before the wire. 

557 
Everyone OK? 
Joe, how is the leg? 

558 
I can not s'efcharistiso 
quite. Well I am. 

559 
Any idea where we are? 
Out AP'TI Santa Klarita. 

560 
More From the hill is 
the freeway 405. 

561 
Then, the Kaskeints. 

562 
Continue. 
Joe, you can walk? 

563 
Well I am. 

564 
Low! 

565 
Quiet. 

566 
They understood that a 
will enter the pipeline. 

567 
-Close all the hiding places. 
-What do we do now? 

568 
-Follow plan. 
-Uncovered? Crazy? 

569 
Do you have any better suggestion? 

570 
Come on, come on. 

571 
-If you do not succeed? 
-We will succeed. 

572 
-Joe, how is the leg? 
-I press on the nose! 

573 
-How have we come? 
-A few miles away. 

574 
It's miracle 
not encountered any so far. 

575 
Luck is on our side. 

576 
Idiots, I must see 
doctor. How walking around like this? 

577 
Not walking around. Thanks 
to cover. 

578 
-Wounded; 
-A hack is. 

579 
The rest of the team 
was not so lucky. 

580 
The Task Force. We wanted to go 
gaiopoiisis factory. 

581 
Unfortunately, the plan failed. 
We detected. 

582 
-What works gaiopoiisis? 
-Do not you know? 

583 
-Who are you? 
Van-Paimpergk and my friends. 

584 
We went to the aqueduct. 
Contaminate water. 

585 
I do not just pollute. 
This will improve for them. 

586 
Water is simply 
part of the equation. 

587 
Transform the world 
the atmosphere temperature. 

588 
Surveying, 
ecology, everything. 

589 
-How do you know? 
-The Russians had captured one. 

590 
The tortured until he revealed 
codes of memory. 

591 
How-torturing a machine? 
-I wish I knew. 

592 
It affects the motherboard, 
kid's hard disk. 

593 
I do not give a damn 
what the Russians. 

594 
All I know ... 

595 
They fight to death 
or destroy themselves. 

596 
How many stations gaiopoiisis 
there? 

597 
World; Nine. 
The three already off. 

598 
In Japan, the House garia 
and South Africa. 

599 
We will traverse 
fourth. 

600 
-Where are they? 
Four-mile From the L. Angeles. 

601 
They use their power, 
to create other machines. 

602 
Disabling channels, 
stop playback. 

603 
We will reduce the number of 
at best. 

604 
War-damage. 
-By now, it's carnage. 

605 
-What do we do now? 
-Changes to the draft. 

606 
Damn! Fire! 

607 
Perfect! 

608 
Yesterday was more 
one hundred groups. 

609 
The attack failed us 
and divided. 

610 
We seek 
our team. 

611 
We discovered that 
if you shoot in the chest ... 

612 
... destroyed instantly. 

613 
Blow up half the building. 
The other half contains butane. 

614 
It is sufficient to provoke 
explosion ... Volunteers? 

615 
Show readiness to go back. 

616 
If you go, 
we have hope. 

617 
If you blow up the factory, 
might have a chance. 

618 
We will remain in the plan. 

619 
Jake, what's the plan? 

620 
I got an idea. 

621 
How are you? 

622 
We have ten seconds. 

623 
Go. 

624 
Get out of here. 
Run as fast as you can. 

625 
-Madison, we can go. 
-You s'afino. 

626 
You must go!
