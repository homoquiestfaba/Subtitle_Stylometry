I'm choking back tears.

This was a big fight
in the writers' room.

It set like the danger level very high.

Please kill her.

It's one of my favorite
moments in "Teen Wolf,"

and the fans are still grieving about it

and we're still grieving about it.

So just put your werewolf
claws away and... and chill out.

Can I stop screaming?

It's hard to believe

we've made 100 episodes of "Teen Wolf."

So to celebrate, we will be looking back

at the top-ten moments
of the entire series.

_

_
Divine move.

Divine move?

You think you have any moves at all?

You can kill the Oni, but me?

Me?

I'm a thousand years old!

You can't kill me!

Ooh!

Ooh, Dylan O'Brien!

"I'm a thousand years
old. You can't kill me!"

Oh, watching that, I fell in
love with Dylan right there.

The way that he said it, his face.

Oh, he was so damn hot!

I was like, "Okay."

"You can't kill me" was
more than just a, you know,

"You can't kill me
because I'm this powerful

Nogitsune but I'm
inhabiting your best friend."

I think out of any villain on the show,

Void Stiles has been...
has been my favorite.

One thing about comedic actors...

and Dylan O'Brien is a great comedian...

they all have a little
bit of darkness in them,

and once you tap into that darkness,

you can exploit it.

That was the only time
I've ever really...

gone into myself and be like,

"Wow, this is the epitome of acting."

'Cause like Dylan and
I couldn't be closer,

we couldn't be more friendly.

We couldn't have been different.

Our dynamic as Void Stiles and Scott

to Dylan and Tyler.

Loved it.

I think it definitely was
one of those moments on set

where you knew it was gonna
have a lasting impression.

It really makes you appreciate

the talent that is in this show.

I wanna eat a big bowl
of Dylan O'Brien-Os.

_

_

It's something as a fan...
It's cool!

... you really wanted to see.

You wanted to see
someone fully shapeshift

and I was glad it was Derek.

You've always wanted to see that?
Yeah.

Give me a sec.

Something tells me
this is gonna be same...

yup, about the same.

Oh, we finally get to
see him in his wolf form

and kill Kate.

Please kill her.

You're...

you were dead.

No.

I was evolving.

In our mythology, developed the idea

that, uh, that was the
highest state of power

that a werewolf could achieve,

becoming a full wolf.

What about True Alpha?

That was... that's pretty high too.
Okay.

Well, it's interesting to think

that might be an ability that only

a born werewolf can have.

So would Scott ever develop it?

We'll have to wait and see.

What do you think?

Maybe Scott, instead of
turning into a full wolf,

maybe he just turns into a bigger Scott.

Like a... like a Hulk.

He's just this really big Scott.

Well, this is unexpected.

The show brings people together,

and whenever we go to Comic-Con,

we're one of the biggest entities there

strictly because of the fans.

The energy in the room

at a "Teen Wolf" convention is hyped.

Everybody there has one thing in common

and it's that we all
love this show so much.

I started a "Teen Wolf"
convention called Howler Con

and now we're going on four years.

It really makes you feel
like you are part of a family.

Like we are a wolf pack.

I think MTV really created the space

to have that kind of
relationship with the fans,

that they feel like they're
a part of making "Teen Wolf."

I'm so glad this moment
made it in the top ten.

I love it.

I love it!

_
You find an anchor, right?

_
Find your anchor.

My anchor was Allison.

I don't have Allison anymore.

Then be your own anchor.

I feel like that's one of those lessons

that you can get from a show

that you don't think that you can get.

It really demonstrated
how Melissa has always

pushed him to be the best
Scott that he could be.

He could not be the leader of this pack

if he didn't have Melissa as a leader

to show him first.

Sweetheart, let me tell you something

no teenager ever believes.

You fall in love more than once.

It'll happen again.

I promise.

And until then...

be your own anchor.

That line... that whole
scene kind of changed my life.

I was able to hear "be your own anchor"

and breathe and get through

whatever I was trying to get through.

That scene came out
of my life, actually.

When I was going through a breakup

and was really depressed about it,

my own mother said, "You love
more than once in your life."

And that stayed with me.

Just to know that you...
you are all you need

is a very like powerful statement

for... for "Teen Wolf" to be making.

It is one of Melissa's first
big like awesome moments.

I wanted really to show

great relationships
between parents and kids,

and to show them be
heroes in their own right.

And it really is one
of the most touching

mother-son relationships in... in TV.

_

_
Peter!

Malia.
What?

The only way we were able
to break through the Hunt...

... is with an emotional connection.

Dang.

Wish I could help.

I love the scenes in the train station.

I think it's just such an epic set

and I loved that Malia and Peter

have this beautiful
family moment in that set

because it was... just made
it that much more iconic.

In a TV show like ours, to...

which moves very fast through plot,

we have the capacity to
take a villain like that

and sort of humanize him.

Uh, to an extent.

And that's why we decided
to give him a daughter.

Malia.

And I love seeing their
relationship together.

Say it like you mean it.

Dad.

Please wake up.

Dad.

Malia saying "Dad" to Peter

is kind of like saying "I love you,"

where you can't... you can't go back.

It's said.

It's an important
moment in "Teen Wolf" too

because it shows something

that we've always tried to communicate,

which is heroism doesn't necessarily

need to come from brute strength.

It can come from emotional connection,

and I love that about it.

And that's so cool because all Peter is

is brute strength, you know?
Mm-hmm.

It shows that he, you
know, he's got a heart

somewhere in there...
Yeah.

... beneath the... the pecks.

Who would be crowned best dancer?

Probably Dylan O'Brien.

Dylan and Posey would be the...

the king and the king
of the dance floor.

I've seen Shelley put
it down a few times.

She does this thing
where she kind of is able

to move her body and kind of
sexily look over her shoulder.

Who's the best dancer on "Teen Wolf"?

That would be me.

And my best move, uh...

You can't choose just one.

Fandom of the Year goes to...

"Teen Wolf"!

Thank you, thank you.

You guys drive our show.

You make it worthwhile.

We just love you guys.

And so this means the world to us.

I think the unique
thing about "Teen Wolf"

and the cast with their fans

is that they're so involved.

It's really important to us...

to see... see that interaction
and have that with them.

I think that they just feel that real,

sincere, genuine love for them.

I've gotten to travel the
world and meet "Teen Wolf" fans

and hearing their stories.

I know that will always reign supreme

in how much I feel
like I know all of them.

I think that's really what's
made it so special to me

is the sense of community.

Everyone who is a fan of "Teen Wolf"

is... is a pack.

100 episodes is extraordinary to me.

And it's all do to the fans.

So this next moment is one
of my absolute favorites.

â™ª _

Lydia!

No!
Don't!

_

Lydia discovering that she's a Banshee

was a pivotal moment for her character.

It seems like as soon
as you know Lydia Martin,

there's another side of her
that we didn't know was there.

Unbelievable.

You have no idea what you are, do you?

The wailing woman.

A Banshee, right before my eyes.

Lydia finding out she was a Banshee

meant that the show had...

a clairvoyant, basically,
that could predict death

more than just a sniff.

It's more like a curse.

You need someone to
discover the dead bodies.

This gave us a great excuse
to have it always be her.

It made Lydia part
of the pack, you know?

We all... we all had this
thing in common with each other.

This just adds more diversity

and coolness to the pack as a whole.

Just seeing her scream
for the first time,

you're like, "Oh my God."

Like it was just haunting.

I would say I always
had a bit of a, I guess,

louder scream,

and I actually slightly
ripped my vocal cords,

uh, while screaming for the
first two or three years.

Who doesn't want a raspy voice, though?

Yeah, sexy.

_

_

This moment of Scott
becoming a true Alpha

and breaking through the Mountain Ash

is so important because most Alphas

have to actually kill another Alpha

in order to become an Alpha.

That's when we came
up with this idea that

by being a really good person,

by sheer force of will,

he could make his eyes
go from yellow to red.

It was like, you know,
when like Luke Skywalker

gets his lightsaber,

or when Captain America
gets his shield, you know?

It's like now Scott has his eyes.

I think in that moment
Scott really changed

and like metaphorically becoming a man.

I'm an Alpha now.

Now it's Scott McCall
and Scott McCall's pack

and we're ready to roll with him.

It's one of my favorite
moments in "Teen Wolf."

Me too.

Who is most likely to
steal something from set?

We have a couple kleptos.

Uh, Ryan Kelley.

I feel like Ryan Kelley would be someone

who would steal something on set,

and I really have
nothing to back that up.

I took the name plate,
I took my shirt, um,

and I'm gonna have it
all framed in nice things,

and I may have taken some other things

but I can't tell you about that.

Me.

I am most likely to steal everything.

I've stolen everything already.

I know I've stolen a couple of things.

Um, actually, from this locker room.

A lot of socks.

Oh my God.

I don't ever leave socks.

I have so many socks now.

Thanks, MTV.

Okay, so we can't talk about
the top moments of "Teen Wolf"

without talking about this one.

_

_

Stydia is so sweet.

I think I wanna add them
to my morning coffee.

The Stiles and Lydia kiss/reunion moment

was one of the biggest payoffs

of one of the longest
running threads in the show.

This was a big fight
in the writers' room

between people who
wanted Stiles and Lydia

to get... get together

and people who didn't.

And then it's just I
watch those moments,

those scenes where
they're perfect together.

It really satisfied six years of waiting

for like, "Yes, please just be together.

You belong together."

I didn't say it back.

You don't have to.

Mwah.

Mwah!

You don't even have to
be a fan of "Teen Wolf"

to recognize how powerful this scene is.

I loved that Jeff said
it has to be organic

and that it's just
not gonna be one season

they're all of a sudden dating.

Everything changed in that moment.

Yeah, that's a great moment.

She's got those lips.

Yeah.

She pulls away and it's
just the look in her face

is so sweet and... oh, I love it.

Love it.

Yeah, I think it's great.

I love those guys.

I miss them.

Aw...
Shut up.

â™ª _

_
When Stiles was a little kid...

he couldn't say his first name.

Not sure why.

It pretty much rolls off the tongue.

But, uh,

the closest he could get was "mischief."

One of "Teen Wolf's"
longest-running mysteries

is not a supernatural questions,

it's not about monsters
or lower mythology;

it's what is Stiles' first name?

We've been waiting for
it, we've been wanting it,

and now that we have it,

we can't pronounce it.

Uh... isn't it Midavich Stilinski?

Can you say the name?

Mieczyslaw.

Mieczyslaw, that is beautiful!

Mieczyslaw.

I will praise Jeff Davis forever

that it was something difficult.

I still can't remember how to spell it.

I don't think I could
spell it right now.

No.

I had to write it down.

Did Scott know what his name was?

Yes.
Do you think he did? Okay.

Stilinski revealing
his name in that moment

among all those people felt perfect.

I have a son.

His name is Mieczyslaw Stilinski,

but we call him Stiles.

I remember.

Towards the end of "Teen Wolf"

there were a lot of revisions
for the scripts, each episode.

Linden walks in and in rehearsal...

I thought Linden was
just pulling a prank

and in fact that was
actually Stiles' name.

We thought it would be
some like funny payoff

to find some wacky name

but instead it was the
most like heartbreaking

and heart-wrenching reveal

and is one of the most
creative and moving things

that "Teen Wolf" ever did.

What I love about "Teen
Wolf" the most is when

not just a person
watches the show for fun

but it's actually affected their life.

The fan art is especially
meaningful to me.

I wanted to be a comic book artist

when I was a kid,

and to see that people
are inspired by the show,

uh, to make their own artwork,

it's just incredible.

I put my art online and someone from MTV

decided to reach out, and it's
opened my world in so many ways.

I can't thank "Teen Wolf" enough

for giving me that
opportunity to really see

how my art impacts people.

I won their walk-on role contest

and then to say that my first

professional acting job
was my favorite show...

that... that's amazing.

We ended up making a
rap video that MTV saw

and we eventually became
known as The Wolf Pack Girls.

We literally have no idea
where in life we would

both be right now if it
wasn't for "Teen Wolf."

I've had kids come up to
me as well and say that

the way that teens are portrayed

and the way that, uh, gay kids

are portrayed on the show

have changed things for them.

That's powerful.

â™ª _

_

I can't.

I can't take your pain.

It's because it doesn't hurt.

Allison dying in Scott's arms

was one of the biggest
moments in "Teen Wolf."

Because the show started
with Scott and Allison.

That was their first love.

It was the first like real relationship

that we got to see develop on the show.

We got to ride that wave

as if we were Scott's best friend.

And the fans are still grieving about it

and we're still grieving about it.

I can't watch the scene.

I have trouble watching...
Do you really?

It's like watching
one of my children die.

It's okay.

Allison...

It's okay.

It's okay.

It's okay.

It's perfect.

I'm in the arms of my first love.

The first person I've ever loved.

The person I'll always love.

In the same way that Scott
became his own anchor,

Allison became her own heroine.

She wasn't just a love
interest; she was a hero.

And I think this moment

was raising the stakes for the show.

It brought in themes and ideas

and... and, uh, that
we hadn't tried before.

Real tragedy and real loss.

And it was something that Scott

had never gone through.

This was really, really big for Scott

and it kind of changed
the way that I played him

throughout the rest of the series.

The person that's least
likely to text back

is probably Khylin Rhambo.

It's not that they are
never gonna text back

but sometimes it might take a few days,

and that's Holland.

That answer's easy, it's Hoechlin.

He doesn't text.

Tyler Hoechlin, 100% every time.

He's impossible to get a hold of.

I don't know if he's...

like he has some app on his phone

that just texts don't come through.

Pick up, brother, I'm here, I love you.

Call me.

It was so hard to pick just ten moments,

so here's a bonus.

Yes!

_

Watching the premiere of "Teen Wolf,"

I was such a huge fan of
like the movie "Teen Wolf"

as a kid growing up

and so I was like, "All right,
how are they going to do this?"

But then I realized like watching it,

I was like this is
actually like terrifying.

This is where the teen becomes the wolf.

This is the scene that really

pulls you into the show.

It set like the danger level very high

from the very beginning.

It's a huge moment
in "Teen Wolf" history

that needs to be part of this top ten.

_

I think by far the...
the biggest fan response,

um, and... and for me personally...

whenever... whenever somebody asks me

what's the most pivotal, crazy,

most powerful, impactful
moment on the show,

it's the "Scott, you're
my brother" moment

where Stiles saves my life...

or Scott's life.

It felt a little like
your life, didn't it?

It did, yeah.

I think it speaks to

how close you and Dylan are.

Scott, just listen to me, okay?

You're not no one.

Okay, you're someone, you're...

Scott, you're my best friend...

okay, and I need you.

Scott, you're my brother.

All right, so...

so if you're gonna do this, then...

I think you're just gonna
have to take me with you.

Oh my God.

"You're my brother."

That was what like forged them into

more than just a pack, you know, it's...

Strengthen their bond.
Yeah.

I mean, so much of the show is Scott

saving Stiles,

and in this scene we
see Stiles saves Scott.

One of the most powerful things to me

about that scene is the words he speaks,

uh, "If you die, you're
gonna take me with you."

Uh, in a dark time of my own life,

someone spoke those exact words to me.

I think that will always go down

as one of the best moments
in "Teen Wolf" history.

So good, so sweet.

I'm... I'm chocking back tears.

Should I let them fly?

I can't, no.

Don't wanna mess up my makeup.

You have no makeup on.
You're right, I don't.

You guys have singlehandedly
made "Teen Wolf."

We love you, thank you
for sticking around.

I know it's been a crazy,
insane, heartbreaking ride.

I hope you guys enjoy the
final episodes of "Teen Wolf."
