[Winston Churchill]
Twice in a single generation,

the catastrophe of world war
has fallen upon us.

Twice in our lifetime
has the long arm of fate

reached out across the oceans

to bring the United States
into the forefront of the battle.

[Franklin D. Roosevelt] Our American
merchant ships must be free

to carry our American goods
into the harbors of our friends.

And our American merchant ships
must be protected by our American Navy.

has fallen upon the sailormen,

and we have lost nearly 3,000 lives

in a hard, unrelenting struggle,

which goes on night and day

and is going on now
without a moment's respite.

delivered by this nation,

whose navy believes in the tradition

of "damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead."

[thunder rumbling]

let your holy angel be with me,

that the evil foe may have no power
over me. Amen."

[water running]

[water stops]

[piano music]
[chattering]

Merry Christmas.

[chattering continues]


Cigars?

"Yesterday, today and forever."

That's beautiful. I'll put it on my tree.


All right.

Monogrammed.

What's this?

Congratulations.

Your first command. At last.

Aw.

After all those years of being fitted
and retained, a Fletcher-class destroyer.

You deserve it.

I knew after Pearl Harbor
they would be needing men like you.

I report to Norfolk
right after the first of the year.

Norfolk? Not Treasure Island?

That's the navy in a nutshell, isn't it?

Yeah.

Then the Caribbean
for training and tactics.

Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba.
Rum and Coca-Cola.

Mm.
Then active duty.

Come with me.


I mean it.

So I can ask you to marry me
on a tropical beach.

Oh, I'd like that, but we can't.

The world has gone crazy, Ernie.

Let's wait until we can be together.

I will always be looking for you, Evie.

No matter where I am.

Even if I'm a thousand miles away,

I will be hoping I'll see you
come around the corner.

Because when you do, it's...
It's the greatest feeling in the world.

Morning.
[men] Morning, Captain.

Charlie, how are the overnights?

Convoy's three days into the Pit.

No contacts, no incidents,
except on your ship, sir.

Two bored sailors with time
on their hands, which became fists.

Who?
Shannon and Flusser.

Crew's getting nervous, Ernie.
Sleep well, sir?

I've never had the gift
for sleeping on board.

Hmm. And I can't sleep anywhere else, sir.

Amen.
[man] Amen.

Sea's a bit high to serve hot food.

I could manage a ham steak
and eggs for you, sir.

This will do. Thank you, Cleveland.
Aye, aye, Captain.

Report to the commanding officer.
Clear the room.

Uncover.


Explain yourselves.

Flusser.

I regret the incident, sir.

Shannon.

I too regret the incident.

I will tolerate no more fisticuffs
on my ship.

So...

"restore the relationships you have
damaged and fill me with peace."

Sir?

[man on PA] Captain requested,
bridge, sir. Captain requested, bridge.

Repetition will bring hell
down from on high.

Back to your duties.

Count your blessings.


[man 2] Aye.

Sir, good morning.

Escorts Eagle and Harry are

We're pursuing the target.

Dicky, Greyhound. Cover the right flank.



Eagle, Harry, Greyhound.

What is your ETA
for resuming new stations?

Greyhound, Eagle.
We can be at our station in 20 minutes.

Harry, sir. We're now four miles
to port of the convoy.

Yes, I know, Harry.
Return to your station at best speed.

Sir, I relieved Mister Carling.
Have the deck and the conn.

Mister Watson, we have a target
bearing 087, range 15 to 20 miles.

my sheepskin coat. You'll find it.

Aye, aye, sir.

Combat, Conn. Charlie.

We're running down a likely sub
bearing 087, range 15 to 20 miles.

I'm hoping it shows up
on your surface radar.

[man blowing pipe]

[blowing stops]

Now hear this, now hear this.

This is the captain.

We are running down the target.

Let us attend our duties well.
This is what we've trained for.

with only a radar bearing.

Let's have our eyes on him.

Aye, aye, sir.

[waves crashing]

Target's disappeared, sir.
Fell off the radar about six miles out.

What's this, Charlie?

Looks like he's dived, sir,
by the way the pips faded out.

He must've seen us, sir.
Got his air and dove.

Pips had him on course for us
and the convoy, sir.

Can you plot a search radius?

I could, sir, but in ten minutes,
the radius would be three square miles.

Give me a course to intercept

if the target maintains this course
at six knots.

Aye, aye, sir.

Conn, Combat.
Course to intercept is 096.

Warn me two miles out from this intercept.

Aye, aye, sir.

Nothin' but the captain's trousers

Just return to station.

Congratulations, sir.

Shall I steer a course for the debris
to verify the kill?

No, Mister Watson.

Convoy is unguarded.
Take us back to station.

Aye, aye, sir.
Helmsman, bring us back to station.

Eppstine, is it?

Eppstein, sir.

Good work. Thank you.

It's why I'm aboard, sir.

Hey, Cap, pulled this corned beef

Gotta eat, sir.

Nah, take that to Lieutenant Cole.

I bet he's worked up an appetite.

Now, Mister Dawson.

It's from the Admiralty, sir.

They've intercepted

It's our first U-boat.

Congratulations, sir. Fifty less krauts.

Yes. Fifty souls.

Aye, sir.

Sir, after that last pattern,

Yeah. What can we do
about this damn interference?

It's not interference, sir.
I checked everything.

The pilot light's on, no surge currents,

and I reset the overload relay

I could reset it again, but we're gonna be

Aye, sir.


Krauts call it a Pillenwerfer, sir.
It's German for something.

"Pill-thrower."

Yes, go on.
Uh, I'd never heard of one before,

but I got a buddy who was on the Kidd,
and he had one on his first crossing.

It's a mechanical decoy
about the size of an icebox,

and it shoots out gas
like an Alka-Seltzer.

The krauts just drop it in the water,

and it hangs there
while we waste depth charges on it.

Detail it in your after-action report.

Make sure all the other operators
are familiar with it.

I... I should've caught it sooner, sir.

No, you did good work. Thank you.

How many of them will there be
before you join them?

The Gray Wolf is so very hungry.

Your women will learn of your dying...
Greyhound to all escorts.

And weep into the long night before...
Switch TBS traffic to channel Zebra.

They turn to the arms of their lovers.

Aye, aye, sir.

Mister Harbutt.
Sir.

Keep apprised of Eagle's target bearing
and notify me when we're two miles out.

Aye, aye, sir.

Sir, it's about the consumption
of depth charges.

Yes?
Last pattern makes 32 cans fired.

How many full patterns do we have left?

None, sir.

We're down to six charges.

We pulled everything from below
last watch, if you recall, sir.

Yes, yes, of course.
Thank you, Mister Flipper.

It's Fippler, sir.

Mister Fippler, we must leave off
the firing of full patterns.

What I was gonna suggest, sir.

"Wise as a serpent, harmless as a dove."

[radio: buzz]

Captain.
I know it's risky, Charlie, but

we need to break protocol.

How soon can we reach air cover?
No more zigzags, no evasive maneuvers.

Aye, aye, sir.

[radio: buzz]

Go, Charlie.

We can be in range
of air cover in 24 hours.

That's 0800
if we shift to a direct course, sir.

Thanks, Charlie.


Took a header.
Gave me something more to do.

That for the captain?
Yeah.

Man hasn't had a bite to eat

[continue yelling in German]
Get clear, Dicky. Clear!

[Ernie grunts]
[men screaming]


[Watson] Dicky's clear!
All mounts, commence fire!

[crewman shouting]
[man] Get some water in there!

Dicky, Greyhound. What is your damage?

Greyhound, our guns couldn't depress
far enough to do any damage.

But, at 20 yards, the shells
went right through us without detonating.

Are you seaworthy?

All three hits
were well above the waterline, sir.

We'll have our holes patched,
and we'll be back in the hunt.

Very good. Return to your
screening station at best speed.


Damage Control reports fire,

How bad was he hit?

Sir?

George Cleveland.

Completely mutilated, sir. All of them.

the earthly remains of Anthony Pisani,

Daniel Marx,
and George Cleveland to the deep,

looking for the general Resurrection
in their last day

and the life of the world to come,
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

at whose second coming
in glorious majesty to judge the world

the sea shall give up her dead,

and corruptible bodies of those
who sleep in him

shall be changed
and made like unto his glorious body

according to the m-mighty working

whereby he is a-able to subdue
all things unto himself. Amen."

Distress rocket at rear of convoy!

Left standard rudder.
Left standard rudder. Aye, sir.

Harry, Dicky. Greyhound.
Eagle has been hit.

I am going to his aid, rear of the convoy.
Maintain your sweep. Go easy on your fuel.

[Dicky] Aye, sir.
[Harry] Aye, aye, sir.

Messenger, my glasses.
Aye, sir.

[helmsman] Aye, sir. Heading up the lane.

Sir.

That's Eagle and Cadena.

Circle them at one mile
to cover the rescue.

Helm, left standard rudder. Come to 225.
Left standard rudder...

Eagle, Greyhound. What is your status?

We were hit forward of the engine room
and have a fire below deck.

Some casualties.

The Kong Gustav was hit first,
sank in three minutes.

We saw no survivors.

It's a bad afternoon, sir.

How seaworthy are you?

We have a five-degree list at starboard,
and we're down at the stern,

but we'll tow all right up to five knots.

We have a flap of plate sticking up,
scooping in the sea.

The list gets worse if we make any speed.

We must keep you afloat, Eagle.

We'll do all the sea allows, sir.

Very well. Greyhound out.


We're steady on course 225.

And we're at standard speed
with fuel conservation.



Sir, I stand relieved.
Mister Carling has the deck and the conn.

Very well.

Mister Carling,
Cadena has Eagle under tow at four knots.

Continue circling.
We'll hold the screen at rear of convoy.

Sonar, standard sweep to starboard.

Sonar, Bridge.
Search to starboard, standard pattern.

Greyhound, Eagle. Greyhound, Eagle.

Greyhound.

Request permission to abandon ship, sir.

The collision mats were not big enough.

We have a 15-degree list now,
and the main deck is underwater.

Well, I'm sure you've done all you could.
Permission granted.

She's been a good home, sir.
It's been an honor sailing with you.

We'll be praying for you.
Godspeed, Captain.

Thank you for a job well done.

Thank you, Cleveland.

I'm Pitts, sir.

Thank you.
Sir.

I need Mister Cole.

XO requested, bridge.

You wanted to see me, skip?


Harry and Dicky are low on depth charges
and fuel, as are we.

I can offer only scant protection
to the convoy.

We need air cover, Charlie.

Do...

Do I break radio silence
with a message to the Admiralty?

Or does that let the wolf pack know
just how vulnerable we are?

What would the message be?

"Help needed urgently."

No. "Help needed." That means "urgently."

"Needed" isn't needed. Just "help."

That's all the Admiralty needs to hear
for a modified rendezvous point.

The Germans might miss a message
as short as that.

I wouldn't need to take this risk
if I'd been smarter yesterday.

What you did yesterday got us to today.

It's not enough, Charlie.
Not nearly enough.

Message from the Admiralty, sir.

Some of it's badly scrambled, sir.
I've done my best with it.

XO to the bridge.
Aye, aye, sir.

What are these scrambles?

I think coded numerals, sir.
But I'm sure of that.

"Expect aircraft.

His challenge, 'Uncle William.'
Your answer, 'Baker Dog.'"


Charlie. Message from Admiralty.

Reinforcements dispatched.

But it's only partially deciphered.

Put together a team,
see what else is there.

Aye, aye, sir.

[radio: static]

[Gray Wolf, on radio] Greyhound!

Your flock is not safe from this wolf.

We can always find you
in the night to kill you.

Escorts, Greyhound.

Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry?
Divert all further TBS traffic

to channel Hotel. Execute.

[Gray Wolf howls]

Thought these were numerals,
but it was "Point X-ray."

"Modify rendezvous point to Point X-ray."

Mm-hmm. How soon?
Something like four hours, skip.

Sir.

[Ernie] Messenger.
Yes, sir.

Go to my cabin and bring me my slippers.

Aye, sir.


Ah, thank you. Return those.


Ah.

Yes, sir, we got two skunks

They're heading straight for us.

Just two hours to the rendezvous point,
Ernie, God willin'.

All escorts, Greyhound. I have
two surface targets off to starboard.

Maintain your screens.

Mister Watson,

I'd like more coffee, please.

Aye, sir.

[garbled radio transmission]

[Gray Wolf] Greyhound.

Guten Morgen, Greyhound.

Did you think you had slipped away
from this Gray Wolf?

No, you did not. You will not.

The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt,

not the hound on the run.

You and your comrades will die today.

"Admiralty to Greyhound. Welcome.

Kindly make verbal report

Diamond, Greyhound. Diamond, Greyhound.
Do you hear me?

Loud and clear, Greyhound.
We hear you had a bit of a rough go of it.

Yes, sir. In the last 48 hours,

we've lost seven ships from the convoy.
Two others were damaged.

And the condition of your command?
How are you holding up?

I took a round from a sub
on our portside deck. Three were killed.

But you are seaworthy?

Yes, sir. Dicky and I fought him
out on the surface, and we got him.

Uh, my escort group sank three others.

Four U-boats? [laughs]
Bloody good job, Greyhound.

We will be relieving you now
and taking the convoy on to Liverpool.

You take Dicky and Harry

and make best speed
to the naval yard in Londonderry.

Sir, I request I stay with the convoy.
I have 56 hours fuel at economical speed.

No, that's an order, Commander.
We'll see the convoy on from here.

I need you to take Dicky and Harry
back home.

They're not fit to stay in the game,
understood? Off to Derry with you.

Aye, aye, sir.

Tell me, Greyhound, just curious,

how many crossings
does that make for you now?

This was my first, sir.


Well, let's hope next time's a bit easier,
eh? Admirable show, Commander.

Thank you, sir.

Dicky, Harry. Greyhound.

Dicky here.
Harry here.

You are relieved of your screening duties.

Aye, aye, sir.

Steady on 087. Starboard echelon.

Helm, mark your head.
