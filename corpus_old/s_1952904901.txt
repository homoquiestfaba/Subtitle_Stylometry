I've got it, I've got it!

Pick him up, pick him up, pick him up

Oh,damn!

Right, always engage him on the left

We need three points
Left

Hey when you two guys are  ready?

Check off

Go! Go! Go!

Left! Left! Left!

And that is how is done baby!

Good game!

Good job man,
you're ready to play again?

No more!

Would?- What?
Afraid of your one on one

Whatever, this isn't my game

Really? So, what is the game?

Alex!

What? They've gone.

But don't never do that here

You're kidding, right?

Why are you gonna put
that gay shit all the time?

What?

I  just wanna be able to play ball

and not make some kind of
social statement, okay?

It was just a kiss. Come on.

Trevor! Trevor!

Look, I was just fooling around

Look, promise me you stop with
all the civil rights show

Civil rights show?

Okay?

Give me at least, you know,
hug it out...

No one's watching

Well, this is romantic...

Whatever...let's go

Hey, you've seen my keys?

One,two, three, four, five,six...

One,two, three, four, five,six...

One,two, three, four, five,six...

Nice, let the music carry you body. Yes...

Back straight young man, this is a waltz

Do you wanna dance?
What?

Alex, I think you've  my keys, do?

You wanna dance?
Answer the question

We're going to the club tonight, okay?

I don't think we can waltz in the club

You've just promised me
you wouldn't do this

It's just a waltz

Excuse-me boys.

Are you here
for the dance lesson, jaa?

Yes
No

Actually we're on our way out

No! He is on his way out.

I'm not trying to make a statement.

I just wanna dance
with my boyfriend!

You'll need a dance partner, jaa?

No! He can dance alone

All right everyone.
Eyes on your partners.

We'll take it from the top.

And you young man
will dance with me, jaa?

All right, ready?

One,two, three, four, five,six...

Right...chin up...

very nice

You got be kidding me

You're a very good dancer young man

Now everyone, let's take it from the top.

This time with music.

You there.

Young man, what are you doing
standing there?

Get ready to dance, jaa?

Now, just place the hands
where they need to be.

You put your hand there,
your hand on his shoulder.

Very nice...Very nice...

Your hands up in the air...
Hold them like that...

You lead, jaa?

All right. Ready?

One,two, three, four, five,six...

One,two, three, four, five,six...

very nice.

One,two, three, four, five,six...

Very good...Chins up...
Hands straight...

Fine...you win!

What? What you want me to do?

It shouldn't be this hard.

You should be dancing!

I don't like feeling like a freak,
okay?

I don't need that.

The only reason everyone
is looking at you,

it's  because you're making
such a big deal out of dancing,

not because you dance with me.

Alex! Alex

Hold on to these, okay?

Just while we finish dancing

And who are you gonna dance with?

This is not my game.

You will have to lead this on.

Waltz.

Afraid of a little one on one?

So, will I be seeing you both
next week?

Yes!

Wonderful. That will be
25 dollars a piece, jaa?
