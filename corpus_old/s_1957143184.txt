Name?

Vincenzo Bugeja.

Student.

He was caught throwing
stones at the soldiers.

What's your name boy?

Luigi Collins.

Luigi,

were you throwing stones
at the soldiers too?

And what did he do?

Nothing.

He stood by, watched the rioters

and did nothing to stop them.


Name?

John Abela, 17 years old,

he was caught in the
middle of the riots.

I saw what you did.

And what did we do?

[reflective music]

Look, these are all boys.

Did you catch the ringleaders?

We made numerous arrests.

That's not what I asked you.

All right, take them away.

Load them into the truck.

Take them straight to prison.


[birds chirping]

[tense music]

[plaintive music]

My, my,

the garden has come
up beautifully.

Yes, Sir.

What's your name?

Yes, Sir.

Do you understand me?

Yes, Sir.

[Hunter titters]

Beautiful work.

Thank you.

Thank you Omar.

Fergie.

Your car is ready, Sir.

Thank you.

[footsteps echoing]

[fly buzzes]

Blasted flies.

[speaking in a foreign language]

all we'll need

to round up the agitators.

I insist we send a
strong message,

shut down these
clowns permanently.


What is being proposed
here is insane.

We cut off the head,

the body will fall.

We cannot do what we want,
there are laws.

We are the law.
The war is over.

Sir, I'm still in touch
with their leaders,

I can bring them back to
the negotiating table.

If we do nothing

that'd just be inviting
more riots, more mayhem.

Now you all remember what
happened last February,

they paralyzed the whole
island with their strikes.

And then went on the rampage,

looting and burning shops
and government offices.

You're being overly dramatic,

they just threw some eggs
at the Malta Chronicle,

that's all.

A cowardly attack on the
freedom of the press.

The freedom of the press?

The Chronicle writes what
we tell them to write.

Now, our authority's
being challenged,

over and over.

The gloves have to come off.

Sir, this island is vital.

Precisely!

And that's why we
have to act now.

We have to protect
our interests.

loyal subjects

for over a century.

Some of these people
are more British

than the king himself.


Have you done your
homework, man?

Have you not read what's
being written?

Sir, our severity has helped

to increase their ill behavior.

War against civilians

brings only pain.

And you,

of all the people in this room

should know what I'm
talking about.

How dare you mention that.

My boys died for their country,

like any decent British
soldier would do.

I have always done my
duty to the crown.

Really?

And what were you doing
during the war?

Gentlemen, gentlemen!

May I may remind everyone

that we represent civilization.

I expect a mannerly
conduct from all of you.

Fergie, you have been
somewhat silent.

We're in a pickle, sir.

Any bright ideas?

I believe it would be reasonable

to make sure that
politicians know

that if they incite any
more violence,

we'll fight fire with fire.

How about that?

It's just awful.

Awful.

It has been a long night.

I want to thank you all
for your advice.

I have made my decision.

There will be no arrests tonight

and no deportations.

I do not wish to rock
the boat further.

But, if any trouble starts
[suspenseful music]

then we will quash it

by all means necessary.

Make sure their people
understand this.

We'll reconvene tomorrow
morning to follow proceedings.

Goodnight gentlemen.

If I may,

we should move some
troops closer to the city

just as a precautionary measure.

[engine rumbling]

[tense militaristic music]

Tell me private,

where is your gas mask?

Gas mask?

I don't have a gas mask.

They didn't give you a gas mask?

Do we need a gas mask?

Private, everyone
needs a gas mask.


Stick with us, private,
we'll look after you.

This is Corporal Bell,

I'm Private Colebrooke.

What's your name?

Private Love.

[calm music]

[man whistling]

[birds cawing]
[waves breaking]

I know, I know.

It's not exactly The
Ritz in Paris,

but it'll do the regiment fine.

Squad A, lower quarter.

Squad B, upper quarters.

Well, come on, move
your arses men!

Sharp!

Sargent.
Corporal.

Corporal Bell!

There'll be a room
inspection in another hour,

have the men ready.


Let's go, let's go, let's go.

Move it.

Come on, hurry it through,

hurry it through,
hurry it through.

Inspection in an hour,
you heard the sergeant.

How long have you been in
the army, Private Love?

Eight months.

Well, don't let yourself

get too worked up
about it, Private.

This isn't the war,
this is Malta.

Thank you Corporal Bell.

["Voi Che Sapete" by W.A.
Mozart]

[singing in a foreign language]

Thank you for coming, Dr.
Sceberras

I'm very concerned about
tomorrow's demonstration.

These constant transgressions

are making certain people
uncomfortable.

Our children are
dying of hunger,

that should make everyone
be uncomfortable.

Why won't you trust me?

I've given you no reason not to.

But this striking and
protesting business

has to stop now!

[ominous music]


[door creaking]

[suspenseful music]

The rifle and the bayonet

are the primary weapons

of the individual
infantry soldier.


Ah, very good Jenkins.

Get to the back son.

Private Love, let's see
what you've got.

Port arms son.

On guard.

Charge!


And now, what the bloody
hell was that?

My grandfather can do 10
times better than that

and he's been dead for
the past 30 years.

Get to the rear, you're
doing it again.

Double quick time.

Captain Ferguson.

Is it confirmed?

Speak.

What's going on?

The Union flag has
been torn down

from the university building.

More British than the
king himself!

This circus has got to
be shut down.

Send in the troops.

It will be wiser

if we let the Maltese
police handle this.

will only make matters worse.

kind of a message

are we sending to these people

with us sitting here idle.

out to their politicians.


It's a sign of weakness.

Quiet!

I need some time alone.

Colonel, Major you are excused.

[reflective music]

What am I to do?

[suspenseful music]

go, go.

Move it.

Look lively.

[people screaming]

Right slope formation.

Point men join.

[tense music]

The demonstrators have
attacked buildings,

here,

here,

and here,

setting them on fire.

I have dispatched two squads.

Their orders are to clear
sectors one, two and three.

A second wave will follow
within the next hour.

The city will be
surrounded by nightfall.

The protesters?
[titters]

nothing but rats in a trap.

[reflective music]

[fast-paced music]


Right, at ease lads.

[tense music]

Corporal!

Yes, Sergeant?

Right, situation on the
ground is as follows.

Protests have turned violent

and the bastards are making a
mess of the place as we speak.

We're gonna restore order
the British Army way.

Any questions, son?

Do we have any intelligence

on the number of hostiles?

It's an outright rebellion
against King and Empire.

Everyone is a bloody hostile!

Yes, Sergeant!
All right.

I'll take squad A, you
take squad B.

We meet up here as soon as
you've cleared up your target.

Got that?
Yes, Sergeant.

Right, squad A with me,

double quick time, march!


double quick time, march!

[suspenseful music]
Come on, keep moving.

Come on, Price, hurry up.

Tall halt!

At ease.
[tense music]

Where the bloody hell are we?

[tense upbeat music]

Bloody hell!

What a charming place.

Right lads,

maintain your composure.

Port arms.

Quick march.

[shouting in a foreign language]

[toilet water splashing]

Squad halt.

Right men, stand down,
two minutes break.

Under the arches, move, move.

Keep your eyes up.

Good God, man, you stink.

With all due respect Corporal,

look at your helmet.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Well spotted Love.

Go and wash that in the
water fountain.

Please take it quick.

Corporal.
Thank you.

All right, Colebrooke, down.

[clearing throat]

[tense music]

I don't like these
narrow streets.

Next time it could be
a lot worse than shit

raining down on us from above.

Right, we are here.

We need to get to here.

We can try the rooftops.

Yes, good.

Good idea.

Not just a pretty face,
Colebrooke.

Not just a pretty face!

Thank you, Corporal.

[rifle cocking]
[upbeat suspenseful music]

Move.

Move!

Get out the way.

Colebrooke.

Colebrooke!

Let's go.

[men laughing]

[speaking in a foreign language]

[men cheering]


Right lads,

for King and Empire.

One section, right flank.

Two section, left flank.

Three section, extremes.

One section,

move!

Two section,

move!

Three section,

move!

What in God's name do
we have here?

All right lads,

glory waits for no man.

Open it.

[men chanting]

I should be topping up my tan,

not dealing with this shit.

Hey!

Do you know how much
fanny you're gonna get

when you go home.

Girls love a hero.

But,

maybe get a shower first.

Fix bayonets.

Colebrooke, Jenkins, Price

keep the rear.

Yes, Corporal.

The rest of you with me.

Let's show these bastards
who they're fucking with.

Charge bayonets.

[tense upbeat music]

[Bell grunts]

Stay low.

Stay close to Bell.

Do what he does, yes?

So,

how did that feel Love?

There are two dead
civilians outside.

So what?

With me.

Fuk Britin.
[laughing]

Educated by fucking monkeys.

Jenkins!

All clear, Corporal.

Good.

Do a head count please.
Yes, Corp.

Get out.

[Bell laughing]

Oh, you are in so much
trouble now boy.

And a thief.

Sit down.

Sit down.

Now...

Now,

fuck Britain.

F-U-C-K

B-R-I-T-A-I-N.

Fuck Britain.

And when you can spell
Britain properly,

you can wear the
Foreign Service hat.

Oh, I'm sure that was
something lovely.

After him.

Uh, uh, uh!
[soldier shouting]

[soldier shouting]
[Bell laughing]

[rifle thuds]

Oh, geez.

[man screaming]

Leave him, man.

[man coughing]

Do I get a medal, or what?

[audience applauding]

[telegraph ticking]

Ah, still here.

I thought you'd left.

I've been out on the streets.

I've been here for six years

trying to make it work
between us and them.

And you destroyed all
that in 24 hours.

Our actions were necessary.

There are dead people,

innocent people.

Well, everything has its price.

It's just the way the
world turns.

Margerie and I gave up
our boys for the cause.

They were ordered

to ride bravely towards
the enemy fire.

They were barely 20.

Spilled their blood for us,

in the mud,

in a French field.

We could barely
pronounce the name.


Where is the morality

in that?

Hmm?

I'll ask the governor to
commission a public enquiry.

[plaintive music]
[chickens clucking]

[suspenseful music]

[soldier shouting]


I smell the blood of
mortal scum.

Right flank.

Wreck the place!

[desks thudding]

[glass shattering]
[tins clattering]

They tell me

that the situation seems
to be well in hand.

That's correct, Sir.

Our casualties are at 0%.

Then why do I still
hear gunfire?

[rifles fire]

I beg your pardon, Sir,

but there's the President of
the Maltese Assembly inside.

He's asking for an
urgent meeting.

Do you think

history will be

charitable to us?

Our troops behaved gallantly

and with honor, Sir,

in very difficult circumstances.

I believe history will
extol our efforts

to secure the Empire.

Sir,

what shall I tell your visitors?

[rifles firing]

[tense music]

[rifles firing]

Corporal.

Beautiful view.

It's not bad.

Get your gear together,

we're moving out in five.

Wonderful.

I can't wait.

What's wrong with you?

I think some days are just
best forgotten.

Don't you?

We've done good today.

It depends on your
definition of good.

We've seen blood before,
Private.

We'll see it again.
[tense music]

[rifles firing]

[rifles firing]

Great to see you, Sergeant.

Well considering you took
your time to get here, son,

well, sort this mess
out yourself.

Go on.
Yes, Sergeant.

Front three, point men.

Move, move.

[tense upbeat music]

Go, go, go.

Don't shoot.

Don't shoot!

Don't shoot!

[tense upbeat music]
Colebrooke.

Colebrooke, what happened?

[Angela screams]
Don't move.

[bayonet punctures]

[Carmelo groaning]

[somber music]


clear the area.


Private Love, all right?

What happened here?

Speak up lads.

[Carmelo groaning]

[speaking in a foreign language]


[man coughing]

[poignant music]


Did he leave?

Yes, Sir.

He insisted I gave you this.

[poignant music]

What's wrong with you?

Nothings wrong.

We did our duty.

I know.

Do I need to worry about you,
Colebrooke?

No, no need to worry.

You sure?
Yes.

We're in this together.

One of us goes down,
we all go down.

Private Love is right.

Yes, but they were
civilians and you know it.

And I was trying to protect you.

We did what we had to do

for King and Country,

that's our story!

Us

or them.

Are we in agreement?

[ominous music]

[waves breaking]

You awake?

I couldn't sleep.

John?

[dog barking]

[poignant music]

[birds cawing]

Enter.

7734434.

Private Colebrooke.

Carry on.

Sir!

Remove headdress.

[typewriter keys clacking]

Tell us what happened.

[typewriter keys clacking]

Come on, we don't have all day.

Came under attack.

[typewriter keys clacking]

Louder.

Please.

We were under attack, Sir.

It was us or them.

Dismissed.

[typewriter keys clacking]

Sir!
