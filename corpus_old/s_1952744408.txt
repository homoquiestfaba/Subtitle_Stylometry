<b>THE BIG BANG</b>

Where is she?

Thiele îþi cares what the fuck?
I care, I care much.

Is it alive?
Want to know where he is, Cruz?

Want to know how it feels? When talking.
Every detail damned.

I can not see. I need a doctor.

Do you one as soon as we say
what the fuck is going on.

I think faking. Orbe're not a date.
I think fucking faking.

No. I heard of anything like this.
Head injury.

Will see again. In time to watch it
the judge in the eye when it condemns.

Condemns me? Why?

Choose. You did something mess... five dead.

Five?
Yes...

I think you need to talk...
With a Lawyer?

Why you need a lawyer?
You're not arrested.

So what's with these handcuffs?
Why do not you Tell me where is it, if it's good?

Because I ask questions here
and you answer.

My client... is alive?

I really do not know?

Play with us as if you're thinking.

If the standby to leave him, sitting here all night.

We do not want to think about and you do not want
to ask questions, Cruz. We want to answer.

Reflex.

I am a human lie detector.

If you do not tell the truth, you knock the ring-Thi
water head. And you love me.

Ready, ready...

Sorry, sorry.

Come on, entertain us.

You were there the night began.
Tell us.

He does it again. Not thinking, not shoot
time. A how do I say?

Well, Poley, but tell him Hairdressers
disappear. Shaver's loþiunea kill me.

Skeres?
Yes?

Do you like Adam Nova?
Actor?

It's good. I think I make good money.

20 million film.

One of the best players getting paid
in history

and I had to tell him
that everything is finished.

Shortly after his affair Nova
with a mogul,

mogul has paid a detective for low Speth
to throw mud in Nova.

Nova hired me to find out what kind of mud
that tabloid expose.

What information exists about Adam Nova?
What else brings out this time?

I'm terrified.

We all have our little perversions.

Contrary to the words of science,

DNA is not well structured.

Adam, an open or not?

Mica is a perversion of man's Nova
albino named Russell.

These two have the habit to mix viagra
with methamphetamine

and hold the organ in the group by 48 hours.

Damn!

What's up, buddy?
It's your fault!

Let me see!
Wait fucking pervert!

Nova is finished.

When things like this
get on the internet

that is moving at light speed.

Suppose you want to get paid.

Wait here. Be right back.

Adam, stay a little!
Show me the fucking pictures!

Leave me the fuck alone!

Whatever it is, I can arrange.

We all have small perversions, but build
closets to hide them.

But there is always fear that one day,
someone comes into your closet,

flashing light and there in the corner,
is your weakness.

But the biggest fear of all...

... Afraid of being exposed.

Want to explain?

Lotion after shave or cologne?
What? After Shave Lotion.

What is your problem?

How is it that happens whenever
shit, you always find your base?

What is it with the skewers?
Astrophysics. Is called Russell.

It disappeared a white dwarf as a supernova.

It's 2:00 in the morning.
I am tired of Los Angeles.

Village to bury evidence
human tragedy,

loþiunea village barber's cheaper.

I too finished to go home.
He and I go to that office to hate me.

Perhaps the fault is my favorite jacket,
permanently destroyed

but once in, I do not like
my occupation.

Should I go home...

... I stick to the tub...

... And to let water spill on my head.

But all I can do is to go back
at my own crimes.

You're a private detective.
Yes... I was a private detective.

Maybe someday I'll be in the FBI
and I cut out my way among others...

I want someone finds you.
Have someone in mind?

My name is Anthony. They call me "The Pro".

Well, Anton, listens...
Today I was treated a dog the way it

treats a fire hydrant. Currently,
I'll leave aside work...

Lexie is called.
Persimmon Lexie. It's my daughter.

Whoever it is, I'm sure
he's in bed, dreaming of jumping rope.

Shame it would be your wake.

What's the joke here?
What does catch?

That's your girlfriend?

I wrote.

I wrote and I each Wednesday
for five years.

Perhaps you have a giant box of crayons.

But that's nothing, there is no house
given with the address.

Where did it ISPA and punishment?
What did you do prison?

No stamps or stamp mailbox.

Prisoners in federal prisons
letters were opened.

ISPA and I was it a life sentence in
in Lompoc, but they released me.

Really?
Now we have to find.

But she is not the Minkowski.

It and So come on, go to Minkowski.

If îþi write a letter and a perfume
with Chanel No 5,

I believe if I tell you that over
on today?

That's worked here.

Ask him.

No bother. I've already said.
I never saw her.

I do not know who he was.

How many guards do you think I put down?

Who the hell are you?
Where is Minkowski?

Where you go when you die.

How it seems thi?
What the fuck, man?

Do not answer the questions with other questions.

Now you want to slow down and bring them to town?

I go?
Again?

What the hell?

A Persimmon Lexie know you're on?
Shit!

Asshole!

Right hook. Like a speed train
that appears behind the corner. And, I remember.

10 years ago, everyone had heard of Anton
The Pro Protopov.

Let's get out of here!

It was on the line. He joined
bang for the money.

Sorry... shit!

Skinny Faddeev, head of the Russian mafia
Los Angeles.

Do not be stupid.
We know who it was... Faddeev.

Are you sure that you know. So you know
and that the grandson's ready

to be the next heavyweight champion.

The Pro gave Anton Protopov
30 million in exchange

fall of his third round match
nephew's presentation.

But Anton The Pro does not really know and tea
concept.

Of course, if your opponent and crush îþi

and then you put down to be counted,
nobody believes you.

It's a idioþenie.

Anthony's career in The Pro Boxing
had end.

Man, there!
Do you have pictures, letters, find it.

I do better without your help.

Sometimes... I do not know...
React, and the right?

How do you find?
Leave, I find myself.

Skinny's nephew died of Faddeev
injuries in less than a week.

I saw that fight.

I saw Anton The Pro.
At that mãscãriciul finished.

It sounds good to me, but I bet that was
the last time you saw anything like this.

Why the hell are you laughing?
No answer. Faddeev?

Skinny Faddeev ruining his career
a heavyweight boxer,

i, and let be killed and his nephew lost
30 million.

And another thing. Do everything without announce
Mafia in Las Vegas about the deception.

Instead, and assume responsibility for
Is this colossal disaster

and try to make peace
the boys in Vegas.

Skinny decide to adjust scores
The Pro Protopov Anton.

Three days later, they found the Skinny
Prostranstva the kitchen.

It was hard to make the difference between
former employer and boron and.

It's the same blood mixed with boron and
Skinny's Faddeev,

that you and I seek, I have found
Protopov's dirty laundry.

Coming down the hall.

Wait, you bastard!
Allow the bottle down!

Hands up!

Eraþi there, I will have him arrested.
Yes, we were.

So what? Do not wait and on.

How does this relate to finding
a dancer?

What does a broken condom
with your birth certificate, Poley?

It's cause and effect.

By the way, I'm gonna be sick.

And Skeres and I pretend
I do not see that.

Skeres and I, and I Skeres
we pretend that we do not see.

You think you're better than me, no, Cruz?

We are workers, some immigrants Facebook
fãgãduinþei in this country, no hairdresser?

But I'm the one who has the badge.
Please for the last time

tell us what you do, everything you know
until now.

And if not? Poley strikes me?
I might regain his sight.

I'll do anything to help you.

As soon as we say,
exit much faster here.

No, I do not care. Tell me if
it's good, if it's alive.

You first.

Agreed.

The Pro Anton was sentenced life
Skinny Faddeev for his murder.

Suddenly, after five years without releasing
conditioned, is released. Free.

Someone else has confessed the crime.

A Vegas thug who had already
300 years

for murder, rape, kidnapping.
He claimed that he killed the Faddeev.

Because I had not Faddeev
to arrange a match in Vegas.

He sustains that was staged by Anton
blood and everything and boron.

So what?

So what? You really think so?

Enough with the mafia. Skip to the girl.

If you do not you understand the point of view
Mafia don

then you will not understand anything
to reach the diamonds.

What diamonds?

Where was I?

A life sentenced to 2 m and 136 kg
released from prison and looking all

his girlfriend. Not so it's a romantic?

Cut. I filmed. Who's next?

So you gave today raided my club?

You heard, right?
Yeah, right. How did you find me?

We've been looking in the right place.
Trouble with the candle you doing?

The fact that your legal name is Puss
was a surprise.

Then came the name of your house
Production

and here I am... in a warehouse
on an artist at work.

I never saw this cãþeaua.
Fair enough.

Herman Minkowski died four years ago.
You bought the building a year later.

Who would you get it sold?
Widow's. Dancer and actress.

Harder, for God!

What's up?

And one that puts an ever-changing
another.

The conclusion is that all are created equal.

Only not know where that disappear.

Between... and not ever leave.

Stop!

Minkowski's widow has no name?
Zooey Wigner.

Appears in the movie and you?
And he appeared in Hitchcock's.

Lights. Camera. Filmaþi, fucks!

It took me about 30 minutes to find it
Zooey on the Internet.

Susþii that when you saw
Puss last time?

Yes.

You'd be surprised.

Puss morning that the day was still there.

And why be surprised?

If you had not, it means you've broken and
fucking back.

A well-arranged black.

Was needed and solidly bãtãu
to make such damages.

What the hell you are talking?

Zooey Wigner.
Story and us about it.

I found it to any of the agents.

And it's not listed as client
any manager.

I found it on a Web page
UCLA Medical Center.

Her drug dependence
profits went through

won by her late husband
the striptease club.

Her only talent is acting
to behave like a sick patient

that BC residents and test the
medical talents.

Friday suffering from autophagy.

Disease that causes people to eat-and
of your body

for sexual stimulation.

Fucking job.

But... my recovery clinic pays...

... and an apartment in El Segundo.

Take a look at this.

It looks like a girl who worked at the club
some time ago.

You remember her name?

No... that's not the problem.

I do not remember too much...
at that time.

Take them. You're the actress. Professional.
Your time is valuable. Significant.

Significant? I pretend
that I eat alone.

What is the significance here?

Wait. Maybe Jules...

Or just Julie... I think.

Ouroboros. Plato described it as
first living creature in the universe.

A timeless and perfect creature.

A snake which its own tail and swallow.

Everything has significance.

Nice. I bet you did a
to feel better.

I suppose that you were in the apartment
Zooey Wigner's that night?

No. What surprise me this time?

Yesterday, Zooey Wigner was found

floating face-up
in her apartment in the basement.

Floating?
Someone let the water flow in the tub.

But you've never been there
and suppose that Anton.

No. I was at Kepler.

What învârþi? You seem torn down.
I'm fine.

Kill me when you see how you suffer.

I'm thinking I do tele evangelist.
It's a booming business.

What's the time?

I'm looking for someone who is presumed to exist
but nobody saw it.

And that?

Always you doing person
disappeared, the other outside.

The soul mate.
It's not about me here.

How to not...
It's for a client.

It's a task.

Is anyone after me. It may be customer
or else.

Are you thinking about serious things?
Nothing serious, someone signs on the skin.

I'm gonna be interested. But remember you thi...

Love sees not with eyes,
but with the mind.

Cupid is blind.

What are you talking?
Love...

You knew what was going to happen.
Always knows.

And do that thing. Cruz,
What the hell are you talking about?

Jazz.
What is it?

Sex, a heartbeat and soul.

Skeres, you're married, right?
Divorced.

May Îþi remember your love, right?

I have kids in college and Alimony
payable.

I did for love stories.
Sorry.

Close your eyes...

and I'll show you my secrets.

Can you love me and you without shame
or fear.

I am a missing person
in your heart.

Your only true love.

Anton was right. No one stood
at that address.

Wherever he would write, Lexie Persimmon
hiding.

Excuse me. Mrs... Mrs...

Just a moment.

Until recently, these letters came
the place is vacant.

They were sent by someone through the mail,
someone who had signed for them.

And?

Are American linden postal employee.
Do not take bribes.

No, no, not making money, but please, help me.

We need to address. It is very important.

Ask the San Celeritas.

Where?
San Celeritas, New Mexico.

Thanks.

I returned to the office for some
shirts and clean underwear someone.

Then I realized that no client
follow me and my Facebook.

The Pro Anton had no reason
rãscoleascã to my office.

You have to be traced one
when he first came to me.

He had a bag when he came, but not the time
left. Or want to know what is there...

... Or know about letters
and where they find.

Really? Why?
I did not know, Poley.

I had time to read them all.

San Celeritas, New Mexico, is a city
left in an area under development.

Anton and dancer that...
She did not know...

... But he wrote?

What idioþenie! As listen
shit?

I do not know. Space and time
are relative, Poley.

Time slows down
if you reach the speed of light.

Things are getting smaller, more dense.

The faster you travel and,
the smaller and more insignificant you are.

Oh... what fun...
Are only the laws of physics, Poley.

You know what you? I think the wait.

Tepþii abhorrent and even more
than on the hard.

You're one of them and you, right?

Stay on topic.

I know you play with us. -Thi recalls,
to tell you can read thoughts.

You could read it to you
in a book with illustrations.

What did you say?

I know you're love to me.
But listen here...

If I do bad, if I do something
irretrievably.

You never know where the diamonds!

What diamonds?

They are on their way to New Mexico...

Lexie is like and if I found
San Celeritas,

instead of which have been sent
letters.

We decided to drive, clear my mind
to think about whether giving up on this job...

and ez to me to my house somewhere...

I keep wondering why Faddeev Skinny

would be paid 30 million Anton
in advance.

And where is the money?

And what a dancer, which represents
dream of any man, choose to hook up

the worst nightmare of Darwin?

I was thinking her one.

Woman picture...

I say that if they find
Lexie on Persimmon,

if that's her real name,

I say that one searches for King Kong...

... And this will be the end.

But I thought.

Not even a minute.

Your place is not here.
So... where?

Besides people like them... red aura,
substantial, solid...

blue and evlavio and i...
mostly yellow.

Intellectuals.

Your aura is gray. You're full of contradictions.

But you have a vibration and red like crimson.

It is extremely rare on this earth,
but... there's something dark about you.

There's more to visit here?
No!

An old air base closed in 1962.

Here we were testing the V2 rockets
nemþi captured.

Then he bought a Kestral...
Simon Kestral?

Yes. Isolated and visionary billionaire
Simon Kestral.

No one has ever seen.

But he bought San Celeritas
and whatever is underneath.

There are some tunnels that you say
that lead to sweet,

where you think it's a military base
filled with aliens and secret underground tri.

But you do not believe that's the and a.

No. And you can not go there.
Because of the collision.

Collision?
Particles collide with each other.

Sorry, you breakfast?

Where will I find?

I do not know, man. And I just
that your place is not here.

A recognize you?

Can you take the sauce?
Sure.

Sorry.

Know the A, sir?

E of Sikhism. He said
that God is real and eternal.

Very cool.

Yours is the building?
No, I just work here.

Who is the chief postal lime?
He who owns the place.

Orders are ready. I have to go.

When you finish work?

About 14 minutes after I start to put it.

What are these?

Screw traces left by particles
subatomic

that move the liquid hydrogen
a magnetic field.

I have seemed familiar.

You must understand that everything behaves

nebãgatã into account that a particle
until something is observed.

Multiple simultaneous states of reality.

When you see something, anywhere
in the universe, to change.

And if that work is involved
in a relationship with something else, and he changes.

At the same time.

And it's faster than light.

Nothing is faster than light.

Release magic...

... And atom.

It's made of electrons, protons and neutrons.

Protons and neutrons
are alcãtuiþi of quarks,

which are united by the gluon.

Gluons are bosons, and bosons
elementary particles are

which is the fundamental forces
of nature.

You're here for...

Because... in two days
90 m underground,

two beams of protons
will face each other at lightning speed.

Nothing is faster.

And you may find it right here
and in the middle of desert.

What's your finds?
Apogee. Particle divine.

And you are here...

I'm looking for someone who is presumed to exist
but nobody saw it.

And in the middle of desert.

I aims to someone, but do not know who.

Really?

How the service works Zip?

Mail? Not working.

People use Priority Mail
or electronic.

Mail goes into a normal drum.

People come and take what is theirs.

When I say everything I know.

About 260 letters
about lonely dancer

and former boxer who became obsessed.

A beautiful woman who found a way

and to share their deepest passions
without fear of consequences.

Because I chose to give love and
a man who never gets out of prison.

Until... out of nowhere...

... To exit it.

But until that time...

... Boxer has been informed.

Nonsense!

Sorry, Poley. The Pro Anton
Do not expect to seeing daylight.

So she told her
which finds diamonds.

Yes, diamonds...
Right.

Lexie is not waiting for Persimmon.

The Pro Protopov like Anton to come
seek it.

You must be very, very specific.
Do not have much time.

Why?
For that morning is coming soon.

And if you want to explain to local policemen and
how did everything...

You need every detail.
Every fucking detail.

Tic tac, tic tac...

Why did you decide to discussion
However the waitress?

We need your name and password cafe
for Arbitrum Inc..

<i>Every week take Lexie Persimmon
envelope of the drum from Planck's Constant</i>

<i>you send us a sealed envelope
by Priority Mail.</i>

<i>Since Fay has never met
Lexie on Persimmon,</i>

<i>it probably came after the program.</i>

<i>The only witness to this event
week was a digital camera</i>

<i>from ATM's at Arbitrum.</i>

Why the hell was important to see and the
her letters?

Because I started to wonder if.

Persimmon Lexie even existed...

beyond imagination.

Simon Kestral surfing
and smoking grass on the beach in Tahiti Papara.

He had an idea.

Why revoluþionat
microchip technology.

At the age of 60 years,
12th century is rich and the world...

and is totally alone.

Damn!

The hell, man.

Ã knew guys are sick.

I work for one of the largest firms
security in the country.

Sustain the government and the private sector.
Why?

Because they see self defense and protection
neapãraþi of a debt of honor.

Take it literally.

I asked them to bring me up to see us
and you brought me to see.

I'm Simon Kestral.

Since this does not give you hand
because, the way it tabloids say,

am and the strange
people that do not reach other instant.

But not only have a bunch of lies.

Come on.

I'm sorry you're here without a jacket.

But you were little...

What the hell, Jack?

Ez Revan and I'll face you.

You can start right now.

No.

You're in a circular tunnel
13 km

90 meters in San Celeritas.

Over 27 hours

8 magnets producing
10 mega joules of energy

will guide two beams of protons
which will be held simultaneously.

Is going round at each other

at 99.999% the speed of light

and will face right there.

We will recreate conditions
3 tenths of a second after the Big Bang.

Beginning of the universe...

13 billion years ago.

Have questions?

Some good.

Why is my hell you're interested?
You know he'll tell me. Because you're not residents.

Over 27 hours I'll find something
that there should be theoretically.

But nobody has seen.
Funny. This is exactly what I was doing.

You know why?

Yes, they're a private detective
and I was hired to find out.

Because I already know why we are here.
We knew from the beginning.

Really?
Who was the last time?

We are sensitive creatures
involved in an infinite universe.

And infinite extrapolation
of our evolution

will make us to become gods.
You understand?

After all, we need to know the secret

his magic wand.

If something divine in all bodies

of all galaxies,
in the universe is expanding,

if you and I were smaller
than a single atom,

where it came from all over this table?

Do not tell me.
Particle divine.

10 with congratulations.

Tomorrow morning at 7:00,
technology worth 5 billion

I will answer the big question
of all time.

Why do men have nipples?
You're a philistine.

The reason we are here
is to find out how we got here.

What's the trick,

which is divine mechanism
that gives form and substance to everything.

Any other questions
a waste of time.

That's the only thing worth pursuing
in the universe... brother.

Looking for a woman.
Îþi lives your life in vain, Ombre.

To live in the city of my hours in advance

making significant questions
about a person,

What's the point?
Love.

I went to him.

I have received from the chief's security

an invitation to dinner, that evening,
home to Kestral.

He told me he's someone who wants
to know him.

I needed sleep.

We need your name and password
from the ATM digital camera.

But I could not abþine.

I had a bag full of thoughts
a beautiful woman

and hidden desires with someone.

<i>I'm the one you're dreaming,
when bãieþelul became man.</i>

<i>I was made for you...
and only for you.</i>

<i>We amestecaþi, you and me,
in our own universe.</i>

Yours forever, Lexie.

<i>PS I did as you asked.</i>

<i>They were exactly where you told me that they will be.</i>

<i>In their vault in the ground,
where they belong.</i>

Because I do not need
The bogaþii materials.

I got you...
For the rest of life.

Where is It?
How the hell did you get here.

You found it? What are you doing here?
He's with you?

Shut tract for a moment.

Did you follow.
I know that.

What is this place?

The land that makes you think.

Stay here and you will be mayor.

What the hell is this... what the hell is that?
You know what e.

No.
Where did you say that will be?

In the ice.
What?

Wooden box
that gave me a Skinny.

What Diamond, hairdresser?

Those diamonds.

Skinny Faddeev which gave them
The Pro as Anton's price to drop.

Wait, u and resin...
No, do not fool Poley, do not.

Anthony believed that there will never exit
prison

and was in love with his girlfriend
the correspondence.

So he told him where he finds the girl.

A and E.
Where?

In the closet.
In the closet?

Anton's room
the Hotel Roosevelt.

Conflict diamonds worth
30 million dollars

were hidden in the chandelier from the ceiling.

Conflict?

You know...
always worried me,

why he paid his attorney Anton
in advance, as to throw the evidence?

But if the attorney believed that Faddeev
something that is hard to sell the free market,

Diamond couple of hands
of unknown origin

Anton and would be realized, but...

Faddeev they still wanted them back.

Especially after killing his nephew Anton
and confused fighting.

Think you're too much.

Compared with you, Poley,
and to make and asparagus.

This is my favorite vegetable.

Damn!
Stops you!

Stops you!

What is it,
What the hell do not you understand?

No need to touch me.
Do not touch.

Bravo, so violent.

I need diamonds.
Where the diamonds now?

Back on earth, where is this place?

What does that mean?
She hid them?

Yes, yes, yes.
And reach it.

First, I had to explain Anton

I found that her Lexie Persimmon.

Then I had to find
if you know...

Who is my city.

Maybe Baratva. Mafia.

I have chased me,
now you're watching you.

Why would I track the Mafia?

I think about it.
I think þinând account of ice.

Diamonds? Why?
Because I killed him Skinny for them.

So he did.
Yes.

Q and jewelry will back
after I gave in the bar.

I wanted to kill his nephew.

I feel bad.
But the Skinny...

I stood in his way.

No I did not want him to kill him.

But I did it.
Sometimes... I do not know... but...

I had to. I know.

When you and another convicted confesses
Skinny that killed Faddeev,

are confused

because I know that I am the one
who did it.

But now I think Mafia
I wanted out of jail

as to lead them to diamond.

Anton... you're a genius.

Now we have to protect my Lexie.

First you need to find her.

It has diamonds.

And you... if one finds you,

will not only lead them to it.

It was late when I received phone
from Fay

and I accessed the site Arbitrum ATM.

I started looking in the ATM records

after a model.

Someone receiving a letter
and by sending it via Priority Mail.

Lexie has ceased to write Persimmon
8 weeks ago.

The so that only the first 4 weeks
of the 12 available on the server

were relevant.

At any time dubiþa security
would stop and take me to dinner.

And then I understood.

Suddenly, my quest to end.
I found who I was looking for.

Detective, I'd like you to know
on my wife.

Julie... ã acquainted with Ned Cruz.

A real private detective.

This honest man and devoted existence
on earth

to imply that the lives researched
the people of others.

Hello.
Hello.

It's a Remorse.
A town to fish and parasite.

The attached shows one of belly fat
the great city,

Eating iþele left and its parasite.

E of Los Angeles
his distinguished career house scene.

It's an artifact from your past

San Celeritas up.

I'm glad you Russians holders.
It will be fun.

You're a parasite on and you, Mr. Cruz?
No.

So why do it to my husband and the
to say such ugly things?

Well... they are just words.

Words are important to you?

When you hurt.

That's fucking deep.

Detach shows up, Detective.

Niels Drula geckos.

PhD from MIT at age 13.

At age 16 he finished school.

Professor of theoretical physics department
University of Geneva in 20 years.

Chief Physicist at the particle accelerator
The San Celeritas.

It's cursed by a neurological disease.

He sees numbers as shapes and words
and color.

Is called synesthesia.
Psyche bored objects.

A and the inner life that is
very rich.

I envy above all else.

Îþi will give a lecture.

Niels? Let's eat.
Okay.

Once I thought that we live in his universe
governed by Newtonian mechanics.

Cause and effect.

Newton was elegant, yes,
but certain principles have emerged

and everything changed.

The electron can be two different things
in two different places

at the same time, so be
Cause and effect e... ridiculous.

You can not predict, with some security,

what will happen to happen.

Talk to me divine particle.

When the universe was created...

Thanks.

It was an equal amount of matter
and antimatter

and should have annihilated each other
leaving only an empty space.

That does not explain how the universe is
as mass.

There is no explanation why we are here
in the physical sense.

Instead, unless there

a special particle, mysterious

which actually gives mass...
all things.

In a sense, these particles
must exist

but I've never seen.

It's like love.
You know that there

one can feel,
but I never saw her.

What happens tomorrow?

We recreate the existing conditions
a tenth of a second after the Big Bang.

Protons will collide at the speed of light.

Quarks and gluons will release their
enough energy to create.

Higgs boson particle's,
divine particle.

It is unstable and fragile.

It will take less than a millionth
of a billionth

of a billionth, of a second...

if needed.

But we'll see for the first time
in history.

Questions?

Yes.
The woman who serves us, it's Indian...

is dressed in white, is hurt.
Why?

Is called Prabha and her husband
died down there.

There have been many accidents.
A former engineer and made a mistake.

There have been many mistakes.
More? Compared to what?

He got caught.
Þintuit as something larger than himself.

He broke the rib cage.
Yes. He broke my heart.

It was his fucking fault.

Blame him?
You can bet,

Because the only error
are human.

We make wrong choices knives.
Unfortunately we have no time to regret them.

Unlike my wife too lonely.

He made some wrong choices you ite
long ago.

Please...

That's why you're here. Do not you?

Let me guess.
A man searches.

Maybe I'm just me.

What's the worst thing that can be
happen for several billion technology.

If there is human error
here in Mexico?

A black hole.
What?

A black hole.

Theoretically, the impact of so much energy

could create a black hole
you can swallow the earth

or perhaps create ciudãþenii
I can start merging

and to transform our planet
snowball into a small area.

We do what we fear.

You came here in the penultimate moment.

Ultimate spiritual quest.

Because God is the Wizard of Oz.

He's the man behind the curtain.

And tomorrow... I'll be behind the scenes.

You should store my things
and to leave

a small ball of shit
the prenatal position, because...

as far as her look,

it is inconsistent in comparison with what
will happen tomorrow when you press the button.

The idea is that you're a jerk slightly.

Your coming here, trying to muddy shit
about me

is a cosmic mess.

You fucked.
You're at the show of magic.

Who can not live without you know
As did the trick.

All you'll do
is to ruin the rest of us.

I think you two need to go.

Do what you do.

Speak... do amor,
does not matter.

Tomorrow morning I'll be on stage 7

with God...

directly linked to what appears on the pipe.

What do you think will happen tomorrow morning
7:00?

There are some hidden variables,
so be it is difficult to predict the outcome.

But I think in one way or another,
Tomorrow at 7:00,

Kestral Simon will be close to God.

Geckos went home and Kestral
descended from the accelerator

to do whatever the hell to do,
8 hours before the show.

Julie and me...

I went for a walk.

You really came here for me?

Yes... yes.

I am what are you doing?
Yes.

How do you know?

You're exactly what you want.

How do I know that others are not you men
I knew that?

You looking at me because I want to see.

You must stop defining myself
as having many men who see me.

You father complex, the so-i?
Yes.

My clothes off for him, if you're interested.
Is your husband.

You know, it's about the same thing.
For him and not just a metaphor.

As a trophy or a symbol that you seek,
always looking for something.

What?

You know... you know... inside.

We sit on top of him. Right now.

Accelerator.

Here the particles collide.
It's crazy.

I'll blow up everything in front.

You know... a big problem here.

Kiss me.

No. Not yet.
Listen. It's here.

Who?
Anton The Pro's here. Protopov.

What?
Oh... Okay, listen.

You can help.

But you must be honest.
Has been going on?

You did it because you were single?
I've written for the paper he wrote

about a boxer that was
to, and spend the rest of life in prison?

It may be worth several million dollars.

Wait, do not know what you talking.

Mean 30 million dollars
life in high style with which you have the usual.

Stops you, and you confuse me.

Where did you get that?

We buried it all.

Did you flush?

My pictures, all things in the past
I'm right here.

Listen, what you say makes sense.
Why have this complex?

Why do geckos?

No, not deny.

I have seen, was recorded
coffee shop.

Why did you use to raise Niels geckos
Mail and send letters to tell you?

What letter?

Let me see.
Who is Lexie Persimmon?

Jeez.

Lexie!
Shit!

What the hell is that?
Do not know?

Come on. Gotta run.
Where?

There. Get out there. Now!

Anton, wait! Listen to me!
It's not her. It's not Lexie Persimmon!

I can not stop.
You want to fight, tough guy? That shot me.

I can not. You're my client.

Lexie!

How cliché. Come on.

It's open.

What the hell is happening?

Where are we?
Niels E's house.

It's geckos? Wait a little.
Who knows.

Minkowski that you danced to?
Who would take your picture?

He should have.
Geckos was a striptease club?

Yes. He brought in one night my husband.
Niels made us acquainted.

Shit!

Lexie!

Who's this?

A guy who believes
you're the woman of his dreams.

What?

Okay, let's go.
Lexie!

Niels?

Lex Parsimoniae?
What does that mean?

The Latin phrase
a philosophical concept,

known as Occam's razor.

In a language that Poley
one can understand,

means... "All things being equal."

The most simple solution, is the best.

If this means
that a lone physicist

began a sexual relationship for five years
by correspondence

the life of a convicted murderer
to prison.

... It was safe, perfect.

Murderer receives love
and physicist receives treatment.

Women who consider themselves to be.

At night, in the privacy of his home,

strikes hidden
without fear of being discovered.

This means that Niels geckos.

Lex's Parsimoniae.

Persimmon Lexie.

You wrote letters, yes?
What letter?

Did you... did you read?
Yes.

Do not understand.

God...
And that comes after you cut.

Need to know. In his last letter
must be said to tell you that out, huh?

Yes.
Of course we have calculated the possibility that

and I realized that would come after me.

Wait a little.
What?

I did something wrong?

Where are the diamonds?

Lexie!

Come here, come here.
Do not make noise.

Well, Anton! Enough!

Hi Anton.

Niels geckos calculated the probability
as Anton Protopov to find it.

Lexie?

Based on its results
and he bought a gun.

Do not look like you.
Yes.

Lexie're not mine.
You're the man.

They are both at the same time.

Please... please put the gun down.

I can love.
What? No! Where is she?

I'm here.
No!

I'm here.
Wait!

No! Stops you!

I love you.

Drop your weapon!

That's all I remember.

Until I came and I could see something
and I have emerged.

I do not know who is alive or dead.

All I want... all you need to know,

if Julia is good.
That's it.

Bravo.

One more thing.

Who was.
Who broke the party.

This... this is simple.

The guy who watched him Anton
and then told me,

type walk with a Lincoln Town.
I can not describe.

One is a fucking sociopath,

and has not finished primary school
because I did not like.

The other is a family ruined

who has not achieved anything in life.

The third type

wearing brown shoes and a black suit

it can not distinguish
between good and evil.

How the hell can you describe it
if you have not seen?

You're right, Poley, but you know something?

There had to see him to admit that
Hairdressers loþiunea's unfortunate.

Nobody knew better story
The Pro Protopov Anton

better than you guys.

You see...

you work for so long a homicide
and organized crime,

but you are not the best
than the bad guys.

Bad boys!
Bad boys.

You know, Anthony was right.

He was released from prison
by Mafia

on a full testimonies
a triple loser

that He might lead to 30 million
Faddeev's stupidity is worth.

And you guys, you guys,
or you work for the Mafia

furaþi times that money for you.

But you been, boys,
all the time.

All the time.

That's funny.

Anton does not care about diamonds.

On my advice, he hid.

Poley... well.

Get up.
Lift, Poley.

Pick it yourself.
Do not have time.

Lift it.

This one is fucking end.
Do not know where the diamonds.

Poley killed each other.

Shut the fuck up.
Fuck you, Poley!

What did you say?

Who the hell gave the bar here?

What are you doing here?
Statham Statham Statham.

Who Killed Puss?

Your client.
Why?

You followed the so-called your survey.

He did not like
African-American personality.

What about Zooey Wigner?
Anthony had no where to know where she lives.

You... bastards.

You have pursued me from the medical center.

I left, I have entered
you waved badges

who have visited before and then

then, then... Poley Poley has pursued a home

trying to get information
and he lost his temper and.

You did not.

Yes.
Shit...

However, you can not clean this mess.

There are too many dead ends.
It's misery, misery.

He's right.
I have, but we can not arrest him.

It was a bad idea.
And you... you!

You're a fucking sociopath!

I'm gonna come as terribly ill
if you touch me, you piece of shit.

I'll be sorry?
What?

What?

Hairdressers stops him before he kills
again.

I have not killed anyone.
Not yet.

Okay... here's one to be.

Anton exit it from decay kid
and has been associated with you.

So you and find the correspondence
that was fucking diamonds.

Typical of you, you've chosen the path of the dead
and destruction.

Now it's morning and at any time
someone will find

a high guard, neck broken,
home to Kestral.

Geckos does not appear to work
and come up to him.

They found few traces of yours,
everybody dead

in a real bloodbath.

What... what is it?
The weapon has a Anton.

The one you will find your fingerprints,
Besides bodies.

You can not... you can not use it.
It's unregistered.

See... I like my loþiunea.

I like the color of my shoes
and I like that...

at the end of the day I defeated Cruz.

You might not find diamonds
but you're reward my efforts.

22 Poley will use gun
geckos it's killing your girlfriend.

Wait a little. What?
Yes, it was here all along, isteþule.

Thi Imagine what will happen.

Wait.
No, no. No!

Skeres!
Got a better idea?

You're in front of you confesses partners
and to go to jail?

I do not think they'd love your partner.

Shit...

I know where the diamonds.
Do not tell them. We will kill anyway.

Where are they?
Propose me a deal.

No.
Then go to hell.

Well...

Okay, okay, okay.
I know where they are.

I know where I am, but I do not see.

And Julie knows, but knows he knows.

With my help you can drive
them directly.

If you kill, nobody can show thi
where they buried the geckos.

It's up to you, man, it's your decision.
It's your decision.

Open the trunk!
Poley!

If ferent engine running
can can put a little air here.

Dr geckos do not answer the phone.

Go to geckos. Bring it.

The detector is turned on?
All systems are all right, sir.

Tic tac...

Dig.

To show you what the hell?

You're a jerk, a barber.

A great villain.

If he had a contest for the largest
scoundrels in the world.

Exit of the second.
Yes? Why not first?

Because you're a jerk.

Five years before retirement.

Damn!

I got here.
Who cares? Continue to dig.

I care, you bastard.

Maybe I should stay one minute
to think that metaphysics is very bad.

Bad decision.

Yes... you found a great moment
for it.

I fucking knew.
Now!

It helps me, you know?

Come on, damn!
You put me in it.

How about 30 million dollars
boy?

Damn!

Take the gun, take his gun!

What the hell is that?

What the hell is that?

What is?

Shit!

Sit down!

Damn!

You okay?
No. I dropped the gun.

Let's see what we fãcuþi.

Damn!

Lord!

Shit!

Maximum speed!
I can not, I can not!

We can not go faster?
Damn bitch!

Damn!

Coming directly after us.

Christ...

Are you okay?

Fuck.

So, you were blind all along?

You are not logged and you came to love everything
and to see what comes out?

Most of the time, yes.
More or less.

I mean, Newtonian mechanics
century and is seventeen.

Cause and effect are figments.

Reality, that is reality
is a sinusoidal function.

It's only the probability
nothing is safe.

I mean, you do everything.

You and I face a gecko.

And diamonds worth 30 million.

You should really give them back.
You know...

In Angola, or Liberia

or Côte d'Ivoire and
or in the Republic of Congo.

Or something like.

I do not know.

But God, really love this machine.
