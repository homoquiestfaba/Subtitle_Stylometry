Dear diary ... 

2 
Now I am sure that my parents 
do not care if I die. 

3 
Last night I went to the room 
while watching television. 

4 
Fell dead on the floor. 

5 
And they did nothing! 

6 
I think the TV ruins everything, 
up with spontaneity. 

7 
When my parents are seeing the 
news of the nine, turn off everything. 

8 
Sometimes even sleep!

Dear diary ... 

10 
Today I spoke with Walt Stilman 
about masturbation. 

11 
He said I had to be careful 
not to spill sperm in hand. 

12 
We put a little in the microscope 
and found some crazy moves! 

13 
I do not believe that 
make us be deaf. 

14 
Well, I hope not. 

15 
Would be the worst thing in the world 
can not listen to Diana Ross! 

16 
She is my favorite singer! 

17 
I had already decided to be Diana 
Ross on Halloween! 

18 
Diana suffered much prejudice 
in early career. 

19 
This is what will happen to me. 

20 
Dear diary ... 

21 
I became the best friend of 
Pinky Farraday. 

22 
You think a guy named 
Pinky would be, well ... 

23 
You know ... But it is not! 

24 
He is the team intermediate 
of baseball! 

25 
Being his friend is so important 
for me! 

26 
It is almost like being popular! 

27 
I think if someone appeared 
with a gun 

28 
and threaten to kill the Pinky 

29 
I offered to die in 
dee place. 

30 
He really deserves life! 

31 
Dear diary ... 

32 
Everyone invited to Cathy 
Quinn to go to motel. 

33 
But Cathy Quinn invited me! 

34 
She said she did not mean anything. 

35 
It would be a control experiment only. 

36 
But to tell the truth ... 

37 
I have no problem 
I check in! 

38 
Not that that is not attractive. 

39 
Because I have other 
concerns. 

40 
Dear diary ... 

41 
Already decided what I will be. 

42 
And I spoke to the Pinky 
I decided. 

43 
I said ... 
Pinky ... 

44 
I decided that I will be 
actor of theater. 

45 
Cool. 

46 
Pinky is so comprehensive! 

47 
He encourages full 
my decision. 

48 
Great! 
Again! 

49 
Dear diary ... 

50 
Last night was 
completely happy! 

51 
Pinky took me home 
after the test. 

52 
I told the stupid of Wallt 
Stiltman that felt by Pinky. 

53 
He said I should be careful 

54 
because he had heard of that 
boys were with each other ... 

55 
It was something gross. 

56 
And I could end 
makes me a pervert. 

57 
Or worse! 

58 
I decided to do the treatment sessions 
of shock voluntarily. 

59 
I hope that I stop to make 
to have erotic dreams with men. 

60 
And with Pinky. 

61 
Dear diary ... 

62 
Today Mary and Zapatelli 
Fancine Antoniello 

63 
They told me that boys 
were talking about me in the back! 

64 
They said I was like 
a girl. 

65 
I could kill me by 
of it! 

66 
Of course I denied it! 

67 
Even said I could show 
that was not true! 

68 
And when finished, turned their backs ... 

69 
And my friends were watching me 

70 
As if I actually had 
killed me! 

71 
So I decided to no longer Diana 
Ross on Halloween! 

72 
Dear diary ... 

73 
Today rehearsed my 
funeral. 

74 
It was one of those days! 

75 
The worst day of my life! 

76 
I called home to Pinky 
last night. 

77 
His mother answered. 

78 
She said the Pinky 
could not talk. 

79 
I should not try to talk 
with him again. 

80 
Decided to write for a long Pinky 
letter telling what happened. 

81 
I know that he knew nothing. 

82 
The next day, I gave the letter 
for Pinky. 

83 
s for lunch, he gave me another. 

84 
He said I was a fag. 

85 
A pervert. 

86 
And perhaps I do not deserve 
even alive. 

87 
Ok, I have ceteza ... 

88 
But perhaps it means I 
Pinky and the ... 

89 
We are not friendly? 

90 
For those interested to ... 

91 
Now I am prisoner of my 
own life! 

92 
My mother found my diary. 
And read. 

93 
My father also read. 

94 
I am now without a future. 

95 
A concern to most! 

96 
Pray for me! 

97 
Bye! 

98 
Father Jon came in 
visit today. 

99 
He took me for ice cream. 

100 
Should have known! 

101 
I mean, we are not religious! 

102 
But only after I asked for 
my Sunday, 

103 
Sitting in the front seat of the car 
him as a goofy, 

104 
it was realized that everything had 
been combined with my parents! 

105 
The penis begins to grow ... 

106 
Getting tough. 

107 
And then the man falls 
the vagina of women, 

108 
that is already naturally lubricated. 

109 
I swear it was something repulsive! 

110 
And when I thought it was 
the most disgusting possible, 

111 
I would never think that making sex 
the rest of my life horrible, 

112 
Trevor ... 

113 
You had hope ... 

114 
I am talking about sexual desire ... 

115 
the other kid? 

116 
Be honest with me. 

117 
Can you help me if honest. 

118 
Already, for example ... 

119 
another boy wanted to play as ... 

120 
I am not wanting to suggest anything ... 
But, as .... 

121 
Pinky Farraday? 

122 
I decided to start a new life. 

123 
I will change. 

124 
First, I painted my hair 
and eyebrows. 

125 
After ... change of name. 

126 
My identity. 

127 
After ... change of school. 

128 
E. .. Maybe go to Mexico, 

129 
And from today, for sure 
change of religion! 

130 
Trevor. 

131 
Dear diary ... 

132 
Today in English the teacher 
asked me to read my writing. 

133 
The topic I had 
chosen 

134 
was the loss of innocence, 
as represented in literature. 

135 
The loss of innocence is 

136 
for an experience 
without explanation. 

137 
The character needs 
experiencing the loss. 

138 
Must be involved 
in their experiments. 

139 
Need to react with 
spontaneity. 

140 
To be injured. 

141 
Need to survive ... 

142 
The experience must be important 
enough to be remembered. 

143 
Must cause a change 
in character ... 

144 
The teacher gave me ten 
by writing. 

145 
Nobody knows who copied 
everything from a book. 

146 
Pinky still ignores me ... 

147 
I must be invisible ... 

148 
Dear diary ... 

149 
Sometimes I imagine that I live 
somewhere exotic in the tropics. 

150 
Sometimes ... 

151 
I imagine that I will be famous ... 

152 
and that everyone will want to take 
photos by my side. 

153 
Sometimes I imagine that ... 

154 
I will die soon. 

155 
And everyone will regret. 

156 
Everyone at school is 
saying that I am gay. 

157 
You should be giving the man! 

158 
But when I look not 
I see nothing different! 

159 
I do not understand! 

160 
My life is now a 
obvious tragedy! 

161 
Dear Mom and Dad ... 

162 
I do not want to think not 
I thought about it much ... 

163 
I thought ... 

164 
I tried to kill me, but not 
said ... 

165 
Do not think that the fault is yours. 

166 
Happens ... 

167 
Please give my collection of Diana 
Kristin Ross to Manistera ... 

168 
like that of Diana as much as me. 

169 
And, please ... 

170 
If you can ... 

171 
Tap Endless Love 
at my funeral. 

172 
It is my favorite song! 

173 
And do not cry much. 

174 
It would be much worse if I 
still alive. 

175 
His beloved son. 

176 
Trevor. 

177 
The hospital told me that ... 

178 
Nobody is taking kills many 
aspirin. 

179 
But I guarantee that ... 

180 
I would not have a headache 
by at least a year! 

181 
I think they were kidding. 

182 
Well, I found that nurses 
in the hospital .. 

183 
His name is Jack. 
He is super cool! 

184 
Actually, Jack is just a volunteer. 

185 
But it is as a nurse. 
Well younger! 

186 
Jack told me that when the 
people try to kill ... 

187 
They have to go back and live 
all over again! 

188 
And the idea of having to live with my 
parents in a life outa me depressed. 

189 
Jack said I would not have to go back 
in the same family ... 

190 
And I said, with the luck I have, 
back! 

191 
Jack told me that from now on 
I should live my life day to day. 

192 
Thus, in the blink of an eye, 
come tomorrow. 

193 
Honey ... 

194 
I want to go now? 
In a minute, Mom. 

195 
And when Jack thought that I invite 
for some heavy festivals 

196 
to suicidal gay teens ... 

197 
He showed me two tickets 
for a concert of Diana Ross! 

198 
Cool! 

199 
Okay, I do not know if out of tickets, 
or because of Jack. 

200 
But decided to live! 

201 
At least until tomorrow.
