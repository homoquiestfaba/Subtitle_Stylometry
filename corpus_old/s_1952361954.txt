How are you doIng?

Oh, oh, oh, and I heard

through a lIttle bIrd

that you guys rented the Earnshaw
lakehouse for us for the entIre weekend

That's lIke a dream come true for us

We had to rent It for the whole weekend

but we don't get to stay the whole weekend

because we have to go to MIlan tomorrow
for Roxanne's fashIon show

Oh my god! that's a shame Oh, but
you're goIng to have so much fun In MIlan

J. Lo and Marc Anthony
vacatIoned there last year

And It's rIght up the street from lake Como
where George Clooney has a vIlla

You know, I read too many of those magazInes
what can I say?

Come on, I'm sorry
Sorry, I can't stop talkIng

Here we are backIng away
ashamed...rIght?

Oh, and Tom CruIse got marrIed there too

Thanks for lettIng me know
What?

Well I don't understand why you
had to rent It for the whole weekend

You pay for the whole weekend
because It's a holIday

and they won't
rent It to you for one nIght

So your frIends are partyIng all weekend
whIle you're stuck In dreary old MIlan

Well that was nIce of you

Well It was nIce of us
It's your money too Isn't It?

Yeah. It's your money
It's hIs money

It's my money. Lets' put all
our cash In a pIle and splIt It

That's a nIce hat
It brIngs out the death In the room

I'm sorry, I'm nervous
It's the funeral, I get weIrd

There he Is

Joe Hollywood
Mr. BIg Shot agent

Do you thInk he represents Hulk Hogan?

No way

Then he aIn't that bIg Is he?

By the way, If anyone asks,
RIta Is an exchange student

I thInk I just sat on
your addIng machIne

Now I know what
happened to the fIsh tank

Coach Robert "The Buzzer" Fernando

was a caretaker by professIon

What a wonderful word that Is to
descrIbe hIs devotIon to hIs fellow man

he truly took care

When Robert knew that hIs tIme was short

He told me there was one specIfIc man he
wanted to say a few words to memorIalIze hIm

So I'd lIke to ask Lenny Feder
to come up now

I'm sorry

I'm not prepared at all
I ... I'm

I feel very honoured
that ... that

Coach asked me to do thIs but uh ...

I also feel terrIble, because
I haven't seen the coach In so long

And um... he always wanted me to
come Into town and see hIm and uh ...

I got caught up In
what I've been doIng and

I regret It

I understand that the St. Mark's team
of 1978 was the only champIonshIp

team that the coach ever had

and uh ...
That's very ImpressIve

I've got to say, judgIng from
the talent we had to offer

I mean, belIeve It or not

RobbIe and Marcus were
actually shorter In back 1979

Yeah but those guys had a skIll
that you never masterd

They knew how to pass the ball

Looks lIke somebody has to learn
how to pass the Kentucky FrIed ChIcken

I'm kIddIng
I'm kIddIng

We're sayIng goodbye to
a bIg part of our lIves

All of us

You affected everybody In hIs room
and um ...

I hope we get to lIve our lIves lIke you

Have no regrets
when lIfe's fInal buzzer sounds

So uh, let's all bow
our heads In sIlence

(sIngIng LucIano PavarottI)

Don't get so mad there RobbIe

So how are we feelIng about Rob's gIrl?
Are we happy for hIm?

Oh my god, the SaInt Polly Grandma?

She seems all rIght
She's pretty

You know. In a "me In a wIg"
sort of way

When uh... Ben FranklIn was
flyIng that kIte, It had the key on It

That was to her apartment

You know what?
I've gotta say

he seems lIke he's In love you know

Well he was In love
wIth the fIrst three wIves too

The cheater, the beater
and the eater

Yeah

You know, hIs problem Is he's
always so overly In love so quIck

and then one day he snaps
and then It get's ugly In a hurry

Coffee Mr. Feder?

Uh... No, no, no, no
I'm good, I'm good

I mean I thank you

That's cool of you to voluntarIly
want to gIve me coffee

Just uh... you drInk It you know
