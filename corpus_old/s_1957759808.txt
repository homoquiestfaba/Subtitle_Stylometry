Guess who stole the map.


Hallelujah! (laughs)

Yeah! I got this.

(whoops, laughs)


The map to the legendary

We will become the most
powerful villains in the world.

Okay, let's get a move on.

We leave for Asia tonight.

Ah, for crying out loud.

Oh. (grunting)

Whoa. (laughs)


Whoa. (yells)

Hurry up. I got a bunch of

Roger that on the copy.

Step on it, sister.


Hurry up! Come on!

Off! Off!


I got it. I got the stone.

Party's over, old man.

The Vicious Six has
a new head honcho.

You just got played

Whoa! Hold on.
I started this group.

We're a team.

Where's your loyalty?

Oh, please. We're villains.

There's no such thing.

It's time

Hello, Mr. Gru.

We've received your application

A recent opening
has become available,

and...
And?

Your interview is tomorrow at noon.
(whoops)

Dyn-o-mite!

(exclaiming in Minionese)

BELLE BOTTOM:
Please go to 417 Main Street.

The password is:
"You're no good."

"You're no good." Mm-hmm.

Now, get up on the down stroke,

Explode? Oh.

Oh, no, no, no, no!

Hey! I heard that!

â™ª â™ª

Come on. Let's go tell

Gentlemen, to the basement,

aka our new evil lair.


This is fantastic!

Oh, construction

Oh, great job, Ryan.

Wh-What?
Never mind.

Adrien, Mack, looking good.

Hey. Good, good.

Okay, everybody, get over here.


Now, listen up.
Buckle your overalls.

Hold on to your goggles.

The Vicious Six wants
to meet me.

(Minions gasping)
Tomorrow.


Mini-Boss!

Mini-Boss! Mini-Boss!

All right, all right.
I'm not mini.

Please stop calling me that.

And also, they haven't
accepted me yet.

Oh.

Okay, fine, fine.

Because you had a nightmare.

But just tonight.

The Vicious Six is ready

to rewrite the rules
of villainy.

Villains of the world,

in three days,
when the clock strikes midnight

and the Chinese New Year begins,

this bad boy's power is
gonna be unleashed.

With the power of the Zodiac,

we're gonna take out
the Anti-Villain League.

And the Vicious Six will be

the most powerful villains
on the planet.

Can you dig it?

(TV crashes)

Do I dig it? Do I dig it?

I don't dig it.
There's nothing to dig.

They thought they could
leave me for dead, huh?

Kick me to the curb
like a piece of old meat?

Oh, they got no idea
what's coming.


Um...
Oh, I'm gonna make them suffer

for what they've done to me.
Uh, Mr. Knuckles?

Oh, boy.
Hey, Mr. Knuckles.

What?

We, uh, just wanted to make sure

we'd be getting paid this week.

What a mouth on you.

I'm paying you with knowledge.

You are? Oh!

Lesson one: Always be prepared.

Lesson two: The Belgian
five-armed nose pick.

And lesson three:
The Lithuanian haircut.


(all grunting)


That's worth
all the money in the world.

Hey, guys, forget about it.
(groaning)

You're gonna get paid.

But first, we got to get
my stone back.

â™ª I see a bad Gru a-rising â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna interview

Oh, you want to come.

(speaking Minionese)
Yeah.

Right, right.

Okay. (sighs)

and responded
to my "help wanted" ad...

"Who are these tiny tater tots?</i>

<i>And where did they get
so much denim?"</i>

<i>And you just wouldn't quit.</i>

Come on in.

Huh?

We've had some great times

but the thing is,
the Vicious Six,

they're the big leagues,

and you guys are...

great, and so...

Uh, the job you did
on the lair...

A-plus.

It's just,
what I was thinking is that

there are a lot of
other villains in the world.

You know?

Uh... (whimpers)

Look, I think I just need
to fly solo on this.

See you later, alligators.

Okay.

Send the first one in.

They're ready
to see you, Mr. Gru.

Oh, good.

Great.

Oh...



(grunts nervously)

(Gru clears throat)

Distinguished villains,

my name is Gru.

I feel like I'm talking too loud

even though our proximity

doesn't require
this kind of volume.

("Volume" echoing)

(clears throat)

(normal volume):
If you told me when I was ten

that I would have the chance
to fill the shoes

of my favorite villain ever,

Wild Knuckles, I would say,

"You got rocks in your head."

But now that I'm 11
and three quarters,

it makes a lot more sense.

All right, who let the kid in?

I thought he was a tiny man.

What's wrong with you?

You seriously think a puny
little child can be a villain?

Um, yes.

I-I am pretty despicable.

You don't want to cross me.

Evil is for adults

who steal powerful
ancient stones and wreak havoc.


And not for tubby little punks

who should be at school,
learning,

taking a recess,

sucking his thumb.

(villains laughing)
"Sucking his..."

Come back when you've done
something to impress me.

Who's next?

I am Wing Man,

the next member
of the Vicious Six.

Behold, the power of flight!


All right, joke's over.

Showtime.

This is a big one.

Yeah, yeah.

To the left. That's right.

What are you doing here?

Okay, just get on.

Which way did he go?

There's that little thief!

Go! Go, go, go!

Come on, come on, come on!

Yay!

Yeah!

â™ª All the young dudes â™ª

â™ª Hey, dudes â™ª

â™ª Carry the news... â™ª

They all said the kid
couldn't be a real villain.

(frightened yelp):
Well...

this kid just stole something

from the worst villains
in the world.


When I bring it back to them,
they are going to say...

a terrible mistake.

Please join us. Please, Gru."

And I will say, "Yes!
(Minions cheering)

I will be the newest member
of the Vicious Six."

Now all I need is Otto.

Where is Otto?

Uh, uh, Otto le come-ay.

No, not "Otto le come-ay."

He needs to "come-ay" now.

(Minions grunting)

Otto!
Mini-Boss!

There you are.

Did you just trade my future

for a Pet Rock?!

Uh... si?


Otto, where was
this birthday party?

Uh, uh...
(speaking Minionese)

This is unacceptable.
Unacceptable!

I told you guys
that you weren't ready

for the big leagues,
and you have proven me correct.

(speaking Minionese)

All you do is mess
everything up.

Up? Pump it up!

â™ª Do a little dance... â™ª

(grunts angrily)

No play-a music a! Ah!

(yells)
(music stops)

My mom was right.

You do not belong here.

You're fired!

(all gasping)

I'm going to find that stone.

When I get home,
you all better be gone.

Mini-Boss...
(speaking Minionese)

And, Otto, close your yapper!

Oh.

Josh.

Si, si.

â™ª I'll say goodbye to love â™ª

â™ª No one ever cared
if I should live or die... â™ª

Uh, Gru.
(speaks Minionese)

Por favor. Por favor.

â™ª Time and time again... â™ª

Kevin, no.

I will be better off on my own.

â™ª And all I know of love is
how to live without it â™ª

(thunder rumbles) -â™ª I just
can't seem to find it â™ª

â™ª So I've made my mind up â™ª

â™ª I must live my life alone â™ª

â™ª And though it's not
the easy way â™ª

â™ª I guess I've always known â™ª

â™ª I'd say goodbye to love â™ª

â™ª There are no tomorrows â™ª

Oh, no.

I thought you'd be impressed.

Could I just speak

(grunts, gasps)

Wild Knuckles!

Oh! Oh!

You're alive?

Wow. My favorite villain
is also my kidnapper?

This could be
a great opportunity

if you don't kill me.

Shut up and give me the stone.

Oh, yes, the stone.

Here's the thing about that.

Kind of a funny story.

Give it to him!
(whimpers)


going to go south

very quickly.

What the heck is this?
(rock clatters)


(Gru screaming)

Where is it, boy?

I don't have it!
I don't have it!

I know you're hiding it
somewhere.

I'm not. I'm not. I swear.

Cross my heart and hope to die,
stick a needle in my eye.

Don't actually do that, though.

Somebody bring me a phone.

Call home.

It's ransom time.

No, no, no. My mom will
probably pay you to keep me!


Call!

Worked like a charm.

All right, let me cut
to the chase here.

I need a genius mad scientist.

You want to come work for me?

No, I am done with villainy.

Off to happier horizons.

Goodbye, little chap.

Por favor.


(whimpering cheeps)

Oh, all right, all right.

Fine. Stop with the face.

I'm in.

Want to see something cool?

â™ª â™ª

Oh! Are you kidding me?

(women gasp)

(Gru laughing wildly)

MINIONS: Big Boss!
Big Boss! Big Boss! Big Boss!

"Big Boss." I like that.

("You're No Good"
by We yes Blood playing)

â™ª Feeling better â™ª

â™ª Now that we're through â™ª

â™ª Feeling better
'cause I'm over you â™ª

â™ª I learned my lesson,
and it left a scar â™ª

â™ª Now I see
how you really are â™ª

â™ª You're no good,
you're no good â™ª

â™ª You're no good â™ª

â™ª Baby, you're no good â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna say it again â™ª

â™ª You're no good,
you're no good â™ª

â™ª You're no good â™ª

â™ª Baby, you're no good â™ª

â™ª I broke a heart
that's gentle and true â™ª

â™ª Well, I broke a heart
over someone like you â™ª

â™ª I'll beg his forgiveness
on bended knee â™ª

â™ª I wouldn't blame him
if he said to me â™ª

â™ª You're no good,
you're no good â™ª

â™ª You're no good â™ª
