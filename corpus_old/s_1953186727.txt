How do I look?
Great.

I lost 20 pounds.

Jenny Craig doesn't have anything on me.
It's for my Playgirl shoot.

Wouldn't put it past you.

No, that's one of the rumors I
heard, that I was gonna do that,

but wish it were true.
He's all yours now.

Hey.
That's a good makeup.

So, Drew, I was doing some
research on you last night.

I am the most researched
man in America.

I have a wife run off,
and I'm interesting.

Oh, you are interesting,
believe me.

So, Drew,
Stacy was your fourth wife.

You really been
married that many times?

That's right.

Such bad luck with wives,
why do you keep doing it?

You like vanilla, I like chocolate.
I like being married.

I like to belong to somebody.

And, you know, I'm a romantic.

What's so great about marriage?

Honeymoons.

Okay.

And Kathleen Savio
was wife number three.

Beautiful girl. And fun.

We laughed,
did some comedy between us.

And then,
of course, she changed.

How long did the honeymoon
last with her?

Not long enough. The honeymoons
never last long enough.

Drew. Okay. Drew.

Justin!

I told you, I told you
the kids were gonna hear us.

Justin, you have to wait
until we say to come in.

But Zach's taking soda bottles
out of the fridge again.

See, but you couldn't be quiet.

No, you were getting too
much loving from Big Daddy.

Did you hear what he said? He said Zach
is trying that soda-bomb thing again.

All right, I'll put
the fear of God into him.

Drew!

Justin, close your
eyes and go out. Go on.

You could have told
him to go out first.

He has a right to know why
they call me Big Daddy.

Yeah? Have you been inside
a men's locker room lately?

You know, maybe I don't have
to come back here and finish.

Drew, I'm teasing.

Well, maybe I'm teasing, too.

You're gonna have
to wait to find out.

So,
what's the little guy do?

He's taking candies and he's
putting them in the liter bottles

and shaking them
so they explode everywhere.

And I mean it,
they're exploding everywhere.

Is that why your
hair's so gray?

You know what? I kinda like it.

It makes me look sort of, I
don't know, suave and debonair.

Sergeant Peterson, yo!
Man, what you doing here?

Just keeping the peace.

Guess that's what you do, you
keep this here town humming.

I still ain't forgot
what you did for me,

helping me out with
my little problem.

I know you didn't mean to steal that money.
You were gonna give it back.

Yeah, and if it wasn't for you,

I'd be sitting in
a cell right now.

Right. Need anything, call me.

All right, I will do that.
You take care now.

All right. All right.

Man, you got everybody and their
brother owing you favors.

I'll take a look around.

Excuse me... Stacy.

Are you the one who called us?
Yes, I did.

And have you seen the husband?

Yeah. He's been running through here.
He has scissors.

Well, that's nice.

Yeah. He's a little crazy,

but love will do that to you.

Love will do that to you.

Mmm-hmm.

You seem a little young
to know anything about love.

Little young for you.

I see. You think
I'm flirting with you.

I definitely think
you're hitting on me.

You see,
if I didn't know better,

I'd say you were
flirting with me.

Regina!

Duty calls.
Hey, where's my wife?

Your ride's here.

All right.

Let go! Come on! Man!

So, what happened?

Some crazy drunk.

Hey, you see that cop
over there?

The one on the left?

Do you think he's hot?

No. He's like 50.

" Ride into the
sunset once again."

Okay. Make sure you brush your
teeth, and no staying up past 10:00,

even if Aunt Sofia lets you.

Don't worry, boys. What your
mother don't know won't hurt her.

Yeah, I know you. You let them stay
up late and watch scary movies.

It's a lot more fun than
going to the stupid party.

Then don't come.

Right. And then
you'll pout for a week.

I don't pout.
It's not my style.

You don't pout!

What should we call those
little comments and digs?

Being a jerk? Being an ass?

It's like this every month with her.
It's like clockwork.

Hey, guys!

It's too much.
It's too much. Thank you.

Love what you've done with the place.
Love that shade of gray.

You remember how bad
it used to be?

City spent 1.8 million
refurbishing this.

Took someone in and come out
with a case of lice.

I mean, come on. Tell me you
couldn't be comfortable in here.

It's almost like a motel room.

We can try out the cot.

I bet you've done that already.

What are you talking about?

I'd rather catch lice.

Why don't you stay
in there for a while?

Very funny. Open up.

You said you'd prefer the lice.

Let me out of here!

You son of a bitch!

Hey, Drew, we don't want
the captain coming down here.

Do you know how much
I hate you sometimes?

Sergeant Peterson.

Why am I not
surprised to see you?

Well, I'm surprised to see you.

You must have some kind
of a magnet inside you.

Nice bike.

" When you came around
you knocked me down. "

" We can keep it like a secret. "

" Nobody will ever know. "

" I should have told you
a long time ago. "

A subtitle made possible by R3V0LV3R.

You own a plane?

Yeah.

Yeah, it's fun to
fly over Lake Michigan

or across to Madison
for lunch or something.

Wow. You must have a lot of
money to own your own plane.

Yeah, I do all right.
And I own some businesses.

Do you know Suds over on Elkins Street?
That's mine.

Gosh. I can't imagine
what that feels like.

I'm always worried about money.

Well, you should let me take
you out for steak and lobster.

I've never had lobster.

You are so beautiful.

So, then, you're taking me out?

I'd like to take you out.

But I think there's something
you should know first.

I don't care how old you are.
I just don't.

Technically,
I am still married.

Technically?

Good morning.

You are such a liar!

Hey, you cut it out.

I'm so sick of your lying!
Where were you?

You're late!
I'm not late. I was at work.

You're lying every time
you open your mouth!

You know what, I'm tired of your psycho talk.
I'm sick of it.

What do you mean you're sick of it?
Mom, are you okay?

Justin, get upstairs.
You psychotic bastard!

Your mom's acting crazy.

Don't you dare act like I'm the crazy one!
I am not crazy!

Stop fighting!

Drew, you're not serious!

It's all yours.

No. You can't buy me a car.
It's too much!

It is okay for you to
let me take care of you.

I just wanna make
your life perfect.

You already do.

You wanna make
out in the backseat?

Well, he bought me a car. It's
just proof he's getting a divorce.

Or it proves
his wife is stupid.

Look, will you stop harping
on Drew using me, please?

She's just jealous she doesn't have
a boyfriend who'll buy her a car.

I am not. There's no way I would
sleep with someone just for a car.

Hey, I didn't know
he was gonna buy me the car.

So you just like screwing
guys older than your dad?

Stop it! Be nice.
You're my sister. Come on.

This sister is nice to me.

What I wanna know is why
you've never bought me a car.

I'm gonna check on the chicken.

Look, you guys, I don't care
what anyone thinks, okay?

Drew is sweet to me.
He wants to take care of me.

Stacy,
he still lives with his wife.

Not for much longer.

Okay,
what if Kathleen wakes up?

She won't.

What if the boys wake up?

They're not gonna wake up.
Come on.

Look, I can just get a room
at that motel again. Come on.

No, no, no, no.
It's fine. Hang on.

I'm really not sure about this.

So what? It's still better
than the backseat of a car.

Hi.

Let's see if we can guess what
Kathleen's problem is today.

I found this letter
in our mailbox last night

telling me how stupid
I am that I don't know

my husband is having an affair.

What are you talking about?

You're cheating on me, Drew.

This doesn't even
have a signature.

Is this one of your mind games?
Shut up!

I'm sick and tired
of your crap!

Just get out of here!
Get out of my house!

This is my house.

Don't ever forget that.

Don't touch me.

Never, ever touch me again.

Don't be so dramatic.

Drew, hi.

Hi. Kathleen got a letter...

Kathleen got a letter saying that
I was fooling around on her.

You better tell me
that that wasn't you.

Drew, it wasn't.

She's gone and thrown all my
crap out all over the yard.

I'm gonna have to find
somewhere else to live.

Well, good. Now maybe we
can get a place together.

That would go over really big
with the divorce judge,

me shacking up with my
girlfriend who's half my age.

Kathleen would bleed me dry.

I thought you said
you wanted us to be together.

I do, but on my terms.

Well, maybe I have terms now.

I'm pregnant.

And I'm keeping it.
I already decided.

Hello, madam. Checking in?
Hi. Yes.

Are you mad?

My heart just was
leaping out of my chest.

I'm so, so happy.

Now nothing else matters.

They're here, and they're
gonna throw your ass outta here!

Or maybe they're gonna put
the crazy lady in cuffs.

I am not crazy!
You broke in here!

Technically,
I still own this house.

Hey, Jimmy. How you doing?

About the same as I was when
I was out here two days ago.

I want him arrested.

Kathy, you know
I'm not gonna do that.

I have the right to protection!

I just came for my
socks and underwear.

You liar! I wanna
see what's in that bag!

You see what
I have to deal with?

It goes in the man cave.

The den, you moron.

Butthead.

Hey, honey, wait till you see how
cute the crib looks in the bedroom.

It's so adorable.
I put the sheets down

and the bumper and
the spinny thing.

Mobile. It's called a mobile.

Yes. That. It's so cute. Our
baby's gonna love it so, so much.

And it matches everything.

All right.
Where's the camera?

'Cause if she
starts going ballistic,

I'm gonna have some
evidence this time.

Don't worry.

I'm not gonna deprive your
baby of having a father.

I already agreed
to the divorce.

But I'm not going to
sign those divorce papers

until you sign this agreement

that we still have to negotiate
the property settlement.

See, I don't think
"negotiate" is the word for

what your lawyer's
trying to do to me.

Well, I think he's
doing a great job of

getting the judge to
consider what's fair.

"Job, " that's the word,
but put "blow" in front of it.

You want your
quickie divorce or not?

You got a pen?

I'll get a pen.

I feel sorry for you.

You actually
believe he's a catch.

Well, I don't care
what you think.

I used to be you,
and one day you'll be me,

and you'll regret the day you
ever laid eyes on Drew Peterson.

I will never be like you,
mean and bitter.

Look, this house is gonna be
full of love and laughter

and I'm sorry if
that makes you jealous,

but you had your
chance with him.

It's my turn.

You can have him, little girl.

He's all yours.

You really waited
to get married

just so you'd fit
into this dress?

Well, that and so we'd have
more fun on the wedding night.

Please don't put
that image in my head.

Stop. Come on. Look at Lauren
and Rick, okay? He's older.

Eleven years, not 30.

Who cares? I have the
family I've always wanted.

You mean the money you always wanted,
the house you always wanted...

Brianna, it's her wedding day.
Let her be happy.

I'm sorry. I just have a hard time
believing that this guy made you happy.

Yeah, well, there won't
be money for much longer.

Kathleen gets half of
everything in the settlement.

The hearing's next month,
then poof, that money's gone.

He could have stayed with
her, kept all that money,

but he chose me
and our perfect baby.

He loves me.

I don't know how
you do it, Drew.

How you get these luscious
women to keep marrying you.

Justin.

Tell your Uncle Glenn here that
Big Daddy's got it going on.

Big Daddy's got it going on.

Yeah, I'd say so.

Hi.

Hey, now, you're
supposed to wait for that.

I know, but I couldn't
wait another second.

So you married Stacy

but there were several calls to

the Bolingbrook
Police Department

to settle fights between you
and Kathleen, 18 calls in all.

A lot of those calls were made
by me, to protect me from her.

She says that you
broke into her house,

that you held her down on the
stairs and threatened to kill her.

Right. Well, if you knew Kathy,

you would know
how ridiculous that is.

You know,
if I were to go to hell,

and the devil would say, "There's
nothing I can do to you."

"You've already been married
to Kathy Peterson."

She says that you
broke into her house,

that you held her down on the
stairs and threatened to kill her.

Well, I'm a police officer.

I don't work for the power
company or the phone company.

And if I were to get involved in
some sort of domestic dispute,

or get physical, you know, with
my wife, I could lose my job.

And I kinda challenge anybody out
there who's ever even seen me mad.

Come on. Let's go, guys.
Got to get back to your mom's.

But wait. They haven't
finished eating yet.

If I'm two minutes late,
Kathleen will say

I'm violating a court order.
So, let's go.

Okay. Well, guys,
it was a really fun weekend!

I love you!

Race you to Mom's!
Wait up!

They don't love me back.

Don't worry.

Soon, they're gonna think you're
the best mom in the world.

I promise.

Hey, honey, the clothes you
put in the wash last night,

I'm happy to do your laundry.
Just put it in the hamper.

I can fit
through the doggy door.

Why don't you guys
walk back to my house,

and I'll figure out
where your mom is.

But I...
No. No buts. Go on.

I don't know why you just
don't go in yourself.

Because I'm not stupid.

Well, how does
that make you stupid?

Because Kathleen accuses me
of all kinds of things.

She gets restraining orders, and
so I just can't go in there.

I need somebody else to do it.

Kathleen?

It's your neighbor, Brad.

Kathleen?

Drew? Drew!

Drew!

What am I gonna tell my kids?

What am I gonna tell them?

Hey. Joe Hosey with the Herald.

I got word there was
a suspicious death here

with the ex-wife of one
Sergeant Drew Peterson.

What do you think?
Is there a story?

Here he is.
Why don't you ask him?

If you say what I told you
to say, you'll be fine.

I know. I just hate the way they stare
at me when they're talking to me.

They're like zombies.

You'll be great.

Hey. Joe Hosey with the Herald.

I'm checking into a possible
story on your ex-wife's death.

I'm sorry to disappoint you, but
there's really no story there.

Is it okay that
I quote you on that?

Well, I'm really sad about it, and
my boys are really broken up.

That's what I'm
thinking about right now.

Today is just a formality,
sort of pain in the ass.

Where was your
husband after 9:00 p.m.

the night before
his ex-wife was found?

Um, he was
putting Austin to bed,

and then we went to bed
together around 10:30.

So, to your knowledge, he was
sleeping with you the entire night?

Um...

You know, I'm sorry.

It's just, it's kind of hard
being questioned like this.

We just found out
that I'm pregnant again

so I think that the stress
is not good for the baby.

No need to stress. I'm just
getting through paperwork here.

The results of
the autopsy came back

with the cause of death
being accidental drowning.

Accident. Oh...

Thank God.

Come on. Try and steal it.

Come on. Try and take
it from me. Come on.

Come on. Guys!

That's not very enthusiastic.

Your mom wouldn't want you
moping the rest of your life.

Hey, guys.

Things aren't that bad. Stacy's
been taking good care of you.

The new neighbors just moved in.
Let's go say hi.

Why would you wanna do that?

You got a baby in the house.
You got a baby in there.

You got guys right here. What do
you wanna go over there for now?

Well, I want to go say hello!

Why wouldn't you
be staying home?

Fine. If you don't wanna go with
me, I'll just go by myself.

Used to be, a man could keep his
woman pregnant in the house.

Yes!

That was so nice
of you to come over.

You didn't have
to bring dinner.

What was that sort of
unusual flavor in it?

Pumpkin spice.

Pumpkin spice in the chili?

Yeah. It's a trick
my sister, Lauren, taught me.

She's more like my mom
than my real mom ever was.

She took off
when I was 12, so...

And, by the way,
if you just take this road,

you can get to the market way
faster than hitting the light.

You are so sweet
to show me around.

It's no problem. I don't get
out much with four kids.

Well, if you ever need me to
watch them, I'm right next door.

Oh, thanks.

How are the boys doing?

Zach's better, but not Justin.

Karen, sometimes he cries so hard,
and it just breaks my heart.

But I'm legally
adopting both of them.

I don't want them ever to
think they don't have a mom.

This is the house Drew shared
with Kathleen and the boys.

This is where they found
her body in the bathtub.

Wow. It's so close.

I know.

Actually, Drew used to
sneak me into the basement

when we first started
seeing each other.

I used to freak out thinking.

Kathleen was gonna wake up
and come beat me up.

He brought you into the house while
his wife was still upstairs?

Honey, Stacy, that's not right.

Well, he had to. I mean,
everyone knows him in this town.

And, plus, she was horrible.

Yeah, I guess it
really wasn't right, was it?

Come on, man. You don't get it.

I just needed
the money for some food.

Are you idiots eating meth now?

Hey, I wouldn't
put it past him.

No, man. My girl. She just
found out she's pregnant.

My wife is pregnant, and you don't
see me out there nabbing purses.

When's Stacy gonna pop anyway?

God, I think her due
date was last week.

And, trust me, you do not
want this to happen.

I mean, they're all
hopped up on hormones.

You think your girl is a nightmare
when she's jonesing for tweak?

Wait till she
becomes a big, fat,

sweaty monster.

All right, Drew.
I think you're scaring him.

He should be scared.

The woman he fell in love with
is about to disappear.

Speak of the devil.

All right. Come on.

Let's go. It's your lucky day.

My wife's water broke, and with any
luck, I'm gonna have a baby girl.

Can I get a ride back?

Don't push your luck.

So pure, like an angel.

Don't worry. Daddy's not gonna let
any of the dirty boys get you.

No, ma'am.

What are you saying to her?

Don't lose this one.

I'll find the
other one eventually.

Well, you need one now.

I mean, I can't be out at work at
night and not know you're safe.

You need to answer that.

Honey, I always
answer when you call.

Not all the time.

So answer this
on the third ring.

You're not serious?

I gotta know you're safe.
I gotta know where you are.

Okay, fine. The third ring.

Looks good.

Get out of here.

Don't fall.
I won't.

Does it look straight? Yeah.

It looks perfect. Good.

I knew you'd be good
at this decorating thing.

Aw.

What are you doing?

Mommy's here. Yeah! It's okay.

All I ever wanted was a little girl.
I got exactly what I wanted.

I just hope Drew
will let us be happy.

Why wouldn't Drew
let you be happy?

Oh, I'm just being hormonal.

Zach's graduation is this Friday.
Do you wanna come?

Edward Taylor.

Ryan Bates.

Jacob Roberts.

God, I wish they
would get to Zach already.

If I don't go home and feed
Kaitlyn soon, I'm gonna burst.

Why would you be talking
about your boobs here?

What's wrong with you?

Timothy Stevens.

Casey Robinson.

I want to know what guy
you've got in your head

that you're worried
about your boobs for.

Oh, my... Stop!

Zach Peterson.

Yay, Zachie!

I'll ask you once again, please,
hold your applause until the end.

Heather Miller.

Joseph Baker.

Walter Young.

You guys should have seen Stacy.
She was so cute.

She was blowing kisses
and waving at Zach.

I love the way she
looks after these boys.

Sounds like you two are close.

I adore her.

She said she wishes
you were her mom,

which makes me so glad to hear,

especially now
that I may not...

What?

We are waiting on some
test results for Lauren.

Oh.

I'm sure everything will be okay.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey, Glenn, you don't have to
put all the beers in the ice.

Not everybody's
gonna drink one.

Hey, Drew told me to put them all
on ice, I'm putting them on ice.

Drew?

Drew, why are you
looking at my phone?

Because I worked undercover, and
I can read people like a book,

and I can read you.

There's nothing
to read on there!

I know that when
you're blowing kisses around,

you're trying to reel in a guy,

because that's how you got me.

I was blowing kisses
to our son, Zach.

I'm gonna check your e-mail.

What? You can't do that!
There's no one else, okay?

You can't just read my e-mail
without asking me permission.

I can do whatever I want.
I paid for it.

No, you can't.
This is not your...

Stacy?

How's the hot-dog
situation out there?

I don't know.
You'll have to ask the boys.

I'll go check.

Honey, is everything all right?

Everything's fine.

Drew just threw me
into the TV, but...

Wanna help me make
some more margaritas?

Stacy's friends and family have accused
you of being controlling, mean.

What do you say to them?

Well, I'm not perfect.

And anytime you're
under a microscope,

people only want
to see the negative,

and any of the positive gets
washed under the blankets.

Why would you want to work?
I don't understand.

I make enough money.
The kids need you here.

Drew, it's next door.

I'm just gonna walk next door,
do a little paperwork for Karen

while Austin's in preschool.

She's gonna let
me bring the baby.

But it's a slap in the face. I mean,
it's like you think I can't support you.

Honey, don't feel that way. Why
do you have to feel that way?

Any man would.

Any man from 1960.

Look, women work now. I was
working when you met me.

But I told you I was gonna
take you away from all that.

Okay, well,
what if I want to work?

I mean,
I just go a little crazy

sitting in this
house every day.

See? I thought this
is what you wanted.

It is. It is.

Why can't we just be happy?

I am happy.

This is Karen.

Karen, where's Stacy?
Is Stacy there?

Yeah. She's about two aisles
over in the grocery store.

Look, is she there or not?

I just said she was.

You know, you don't need to check
up on her when she's with me.

How do I know what you
two are doing together

when you're out there
on your little trips?

Come on. Listen,
you want her to be with me.

I mean, the most
trouble she's gonna get into

is buying trashy magazines
at the checkout stand.

Why don't you
give her some space?

Is that Drew?

Gosh. He's probably
been trying to call me.

I left my
cell phone in the car.

Okay, will you just
watch Kaitlyn for a minute?

I gotta call him back.

It's not even dark, and
you're dragging us by here?

You used to just do it late at night,
which, you know, I get, but...

No, you don't.

Hey, I'm married,
too, remember?

Yeah, but I've seen your wife.

She's not exactly
a stone-cold fox.

Hey! Watch it!

I'm just telling the truth.
I mean, look at Stacy.

I mean, she's like a flower.

You know,
in bloom and, you know,

putting her
scent out everywhere.

And don't tell me
that you can't smell it.

I ain't touching that one
with a 10-foot pole.

That's right. You keep your
damn pole away from my wife.

You're yanking my chain, right?

Those boys are my nephews. I can
take them out for an ice cream cone.

Yes, you can.

It's just Drew
will be mad at me

if I let you take
them without him knowing.

He knew I was coming today.
I left him a message.

But he didn't tell me. If you
just wait till he calls back...

He's not gonna call you back!
Okay?

It's part of his little game
to screw with me.

You know what?

You're probably part
of that game, so fine.

You win.

Sofia, wait. Look, I know
the boys wanna see you!

So let them come out and see me!
You're not those boys' mother.

I think you know
what happened to

their mother just
as well as I do,

and Drew will go
to hell for it.

Wait...

Was that Kathleen's sister?

Yeah. Kathleen was
exactly the same way.

She used to come over all the
time and say nasty stuff to me.

She said I was gonna end up just like her.

Thought it was Drew.

Hey, Rick. Is everything okay?

Oh, no.

Your sister
will be dearly missed.

She was a strong woman.

She'd accepted this
as God's will.

He's full of it.
She fought so hard.

Yeah, but she knew
it was coming.

When I saw her last week, she
kept looking at me so funny,

asking if I knew
how short life was.

Don't waste one day
being unhappy.

That's what she said to me.

I love you very much.

Hey, you're blubbering
all over this nice suit.

I got a box of Kleenex
in the car.

I hate this.

I hate it. She didn't
even make it past 30.

This is kinda good
for you, though, right?

I saw the way
you were touching Rick.

I know you're
sleeping with him.

All those times you told me you were
going to the hospital to see Lauren,

I know you were
sneaking off with him.

My sister's in that casket.

You see? You didn't deny it.

You're disgusting. I can't
even look at you right now.

I wanna know how many times
you banged him.

Just tell me.

Was it five?

Ten, Twenty?
God, stop!

You forget that I know

that you're not the kinda girl
that lets marriage stop you.

You forget that I know
what kind of whore you are.

Oh, my God!

Don't ever hold me down again!

I can't do this anymore.

We're done, Drew. It's over.

You know you're
not going anywhere.

Yeah. You're right.
I'm not going anywhere.

You are. You're moving out.

Kathleen was right about you.

She was right about everything.

I want you out!

And if you don't go,

I'm gonna make life
very difficult for you.

And I know you know
exactly what I mean.

I was an ass last night.

A jealous, insecure ass.

Yes, you were.

I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

I'm trying to make it better.

Okay, well, you can't make it better.
Not anymore.

But I know how much
you love these kids.

You wouldn't
break up our family

over one stupid fight, are you?

One stupid fight, Drew?

You're upset.

Your sister died.
Just need a little time.

You leaving is not an option.

Four kids? Isn't that overkill?

No. I love being a mom.

It's amazing being a mom.

I just need to not
be a wife anymore.

Okay, but why call me?

I mean, we dated
a really long time ago

and I'm not into the kid thing.

Don't flatter yourself.

I'm not looking for a new guy.
No, I don't know.

I guess I just needed to talk
to someone who knew me before.

I used to be
really brave, right?

Yeah. You climbed out of
the window of my truck

to grab a beer out of
the cooler in the back,

while we were
speeding on the highway.

I was just trying to remember
what it felt like to be brave.

And I remembered
you used to take me to the...

What?

Is there a problem, Officer?

Well, there's
definitely a problem

if you're sleeping
with my wife.

Whoa, whoa.
We're just having lunch here.

Stop, there's nothing romantic here, okay?
He's just a friend.

Then why didn't
you tell me about it?

I'll leave you two alone. No,
no, you should eat your lunch.

I'm not hungry.

I said you should
eat your lunch.

You can't do that.

Who are you gonna call?

My wife should
be able to go out,

have a meal with a friend.

So, eat up.

You know we have to go back
for my car at some point.

You can't keep my keys forever.

I'm not keeping your keys,

but I'm not gonna let you
drive when you're so upset.

God, of course I was upset.
That was horrible!

Our relationship
is not gonna work

if you want to run
around with other guys.

There is no relationship, Drew.
I just told you, we are done!

I'm the one who
should be pissed off.

You're running around
with a guy in secret,

and I'm willing to forgive and forget,
but you gotta meet me halfway.

All I have to do
is get a lawyer.

I'm not gonna let that happen.

I'm not gonna lose my wife,
my kids, and my house.

I've worked too hard.

Stacy, honey.
Hey, are you okay?

He won't leave.
He's never gonna leave.

Honey.

Hey, listen to me.
Don't worry about him, okay?

You can always leave.

He won't let me go.

He'll kill me
before he lets me go.

What?

Hey, did he threaten you?

It doesn't matter.

It does matter.
Yes, it matters. You matter.

I'm already dead.

I really needed to
speak with you, Pastor.

I have to leave him.

I have to end my marriage.

I want you and Drew to come
in and talk to me, together.

You don't understand.

I'm terrified of him.

Where are you going?

I told Brianna I would help
paint her new apartment.

But if you're gonna
lose it, I'm not gonna...

Why would I lose it?

You should go.

What?

Go be with your sister.
It'll do you some good.

Do you like it?

So, the last time you saw Stacy

was the morning of
October the 28th?

Correct.

Would you care to walk us through
the events of that morning?

I had come home from the night
shift, and she was just waking up,

and she told me that she was going
to paint her sister's house.

And you talked to her?

I wished her a good day
and told her to have fun,

and she left, I believe
around 11:30 in the morning.

But you talked
to her after that?

I got a call.
I was out running errands

and she told me that
she'd found someone else

and that she was leaving,
just like that.

Hi. So, yes, of course I'm
gonna help you paint your apartment,

I will be there by 10:00.

But I just wanted you to know,
I think I'm gonna get a new phone.

You know why.

Okay. Talk to you in
a little bit. Love you.

Do you know where Stacy is?

No. But I've been
wondering about her,

'cause she hadn't
been answering her cell.

Yeah, I know. I've
been calling her all day,

and I'm worried out of my mind.

Where's Stacy?

She didn't show up to paint with me today.
She won't answer her phone.

What's going on, Drew?

She left me.

So she finally did it, huh?

She called me on the phone, and she
said that she was with a new guy

and she was leaving.

No. Wait a minute.
Stacy wasn't seeing anyone.

Did she tell you
she was seeing someone?

Daddy,
when are we gonna eat?

She left without the kids?

Stacy? Stacy?

Wait a minute.

Stacy would not leave those kids behind.
I know her.

Those kids are
everything to her.

She wouldn't leave them behind.

That's what
I would have thought.

But that's what she did.

And I don't think
she's coming back.

Stacy told me she'd
asked Drew to move out,

and that she wanted a divorce
but he wouldn't agree to it.

The thing is, she...

She told me that
she thought that.

Drew would kill her if
she ever tried to leave.

I told you it was useless
to call the police.

I don't work with Bolingbrook. I'm a
detective with the Illinois State Police.

Prior to this morning, I've never
even met Sergeant Peterson.

You'll still protect him.

I can assure you both

that we will investigate
this objectively.

Stacy threatened to leave me
almost every month,

sort of, you know, coordinated
around her menstrual cycle.

You know,
so I'm kind of not surprised.

But I'm sure she's laughing her ass off
now, with you guys coming after me.

No one's coming
after you, Drew.

I know these boys.

They'll treat you
fair and square.

It's very early.

She's only been
missing 24 hours yet.

But she's not.

She's on a beach
somewhere with a new guy.

Maybe she'll do you a favor and
call her sister sometime soon.

I wouldn't hold my breath.
She likes seeing me squirm.

Listen, I'm a police officer. I
understand you have a job to do.

But I would really appreciate
some space. I mean...

I just got left.
My kids just got left.

So I take it
no one's found her yet.

I love that girl so much.

I really think
she might be dead.

Sweetie, let's just hope you're wrong, okay?
Let's hope you're wrong.

Oh, God, I hope I'm wrong.

Stacy's friends and family
immediately called the police

and said they thought
you had done something to her.

That's right.
Did that surprise you?

Not at all.

You know,
whenever something happens

the suspicion always
falls on the husband.

If I were the investigating
officer, I'd feel the same way.

Joe, look alive. Yeah.

Alive and kicking. No worries.

Got a missing-persons
story for you.

This young lady says her...
Sister?

Her sister disappeared under
suspicious circumstances.

If there's anything to it, I'll
need the story no later than 5:00.

Sorry about that. Editors, they don't
always have the best bedside manner.

I don't care. I just wanna find
out what happened to my sister.

So, why are the
circumstances suspicious?

I think her husband
did something to her.

She has four little kids.

He says she left them, but I
know she would never leave them.

And what's your sister's name?

Stacy Peterson.

Her husband's Drew Peterson.

He works for the police
department in Bolingbrook.

Drew Peterson?

Now to a mystery in Illinois.

What happened to the wife
of a police sergeant

who vanished over the weekend?

She is his fourth wife.

His last spouse died in
her home three years ago,

and now investigators...

Aberdeen.

Joe. Just the man I need.

Hosey will know.
He does his homework.

Most of the time.

The missing wife is the fourth wife?
Yeah.

The third wife? Drowned in the
dry bathtub, so they say.

I even talked to Peterson
at the last inquest.

Wait a second. You know him?

Well enough to get
me some face time?

He's been
shooting all of us down.

Well, then, I should go see
if he'll talk to me first.

What do I got to do,
put a sign on the door?

Drew doesn't
want to talk to you.

I know, and I can't
say that I blame him.

But I've interviewed him before,
and I quoted him accurately,

so, if he wants to get
his side of the story out.

I recognize you.

You feel like telling me
what's up with your wife?

Why not?

There goes my new best friend.

I was just making
the kids some eggs.

I haven't made
breakfast in a while.

Guess you'd better
get used to it now, huh?

Just call me Mr. Mom
from now on.

So, where do you
think your wife is, Drew?

On a beach somewhere,
getting laid.

I don't know.

He's got crap luck for wives.
I'll tell you that much.

You can say that.

You know, where does she
put the whisks, huh?

I spoke with Stacy's sister.

I wouldn't do that.
She's always hated me.

She told Stacy that
she'd regret marrying me.

And did she?

I guess she did at that.

I've known Drew seven years.

Okay? He's a good guy.
He's a great guy.

I'll get it.

You see,
it's times like this where

you really know
who your friends are.

He's the one who found your last
wife dead, in the bathtub, right?

Correct. He had that honor.

You do realize why all the
reporters are out there, right?

Slow news day?

A possible murder of
a beautiful young lady

isn't exactly boring news.

You know,
you have a lot of nerve

coming in here and
talking to me like that.

If she doesn't
show her face soon,

a lot of people will say the
same thing, like the police.

No, I don't think so. I mean,
those guys, they all know me.

Drew?

Sergeant Peterson,
we have a warrant

allowing us to
search the premises.

I guess I was wrong.

Hi. The state boys
are searching my house,

so I wondered if the kids
could come here for a minute.

Absolutely.
You boys come on in.

Thanks.

Hey, kids, really take care of
the little ones for a minute

so I can have
a little talk with Karen.

Yeah. There's some popsicles in the freezer.
You boys can help yourself.

Come on into my office.

I thought we could talk
in here without the kids.

They've heard all of this yammering.
They don't need it.

Been a long time since
I banged a girl in a bathroom.

Sorry. I'm probably just trying
to make light of things.

Just tell me what you want.

I want to thank you for being
so good with the kids.

And hopefully
you can be around more,

'cause it's hard now
with Stacy run off.

Is that what you told them,
that she left them?

No, I told them
that she's on vacation,

and that I'm hoping
she comes back soon.

Yeah. So do I.

And I know that, you know,
you and Stacy were talking

and I'm not gonna deny that we
didn't have our rough patch,

but I love her.

Okay.

I mean, I'm pissed at her.

I wish she'd show her face.

But I love the girl.

And I wouldn't do
nothing to hurt her.

I'm gonna go check on the boys.

Justin, honey,
didn't you want a Popsicle?

Hey, sweetie, you okay?

You know, he's gonna be fine.

Sweetie, I know you're
worried about your mom.

We all are.

But don't you worry. The police
are asking a lot of questions.

Nobody should
talk to the police.

No, honey, no. Listen to me.

We should all talk to the police, all
of us, tell them everything you know.

Stacy isn't the only wife of Drew
Peterson you should be talking about!

This is my sister Kathleen's death
certificate, Drew's last wife.

I've said all along that her
death wasn't an accident,

but did anybody
listen to me? No!

Are you listening to me now?
Ask yourself this question.

Ask the police this question.
There he is.

Why do bad things keep happening
to Drew Peterson's wives?

Please, leave me alone.
Leave my little world alone.

Leave my family alone.

We are gonna start with
the search for Stacy Peterson,

the young mother
from Illinois who

has been missing
for two weeks now.

Her husband, police sergeant Drew
Peterson, is now considered a suspect

in what investigators have upgraded
from a missing-person case

to a possible homicide.

Hey, guys, come on in. Dinner's
almost ready. Come on.

Grab your sister and clean up. Come
on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

Thanks for picking
them up from practice.

I'm trying not to go outside
with all those cameras.

Look, Drew,
Justin must have asked me

about 20 times,
"Where's Mommy?"

Look, you gotta tell those kids
that Stacy's not coming back.

But I don't know that
she's not coming back.

I mean, she could get tired of
hanging out with what's-his-face.

There is no what's-his-face,
and you know it.

You see, the problem is that
you think that you know Stacy,

but you only know the side
she wants you to see.

I mean, I caught her having
lunch with some guy.

She had lunch with some guy,
and she had to die for that?

She had lunch with some guy,
and you made her disappear?

Hey, you watch your mouth. No.

'Cause I am sick of
going on with your little act.

You and I both know that Stacy
didn't run off with someone.

You did something to her.

Get the hell out of my house.

Don't you dare touch me!

I will open that door, and 50
reporters will hear me scream.

The true colors of a nasty
bitch come out eventually.

I hope you had fun
visiting my kids,

'cause you're never gonna
see them again. Get out.

Round-the-clock searches have turned
up no sign of Stacy Peterson,

and the police
have now declared

the young mother's disappearance
a potential homicide.

Go, go, go.

I just got a tip that Peterson's
brother's in the hospital.

Overdose.

Glenn, Glenn, Glenn.

You tried to kill yourself?

You couldn't
even get that right.

You know, you're like a chick.

You got that little voice inside
your head just yammering away.

Yammer, yammer.
You got to tell it to shut up.

Be a man.

And a real man, he never folds.

Ever.

Today, searchers in
Illinois are still.

Today, searchers in
Illinois are still

trying to find
23-year-old Stacy Peterson,

the police sergeant's wife who's
been missing since last month.

And now investigators are
taking an even closer look

at the death of the
sergeant's previous wife.

The latest from
NBC's Kevin Tibbles.

Day 12, and the
search continues on foot,

on horseback,
even on all-terrain vehicles.

So, we're looking for volunteers
to help us search for Stacy,

and we want people to put up these
posters in their homes and businesses.

We're also selling these bumper
stickers, and people can buy them

and that's gonna help us
pay for the search efforts.

You think the police aren't
doing enough to find Stacy?

Well, we're not gonna give up.

And starting tomorrow,
people can meet us

at the Westside Community Church.
Somebody's coming out.

That's where we're gonna have
our staging area, and people...

Here he goes again.

Park in front of your house,
see how you guys like it.

Do you plan on joining
any searches to find her?

Wow. You are so hot.

Isn't she hot?

Well, just hours
after state police

officially declared Peterson a
suspect in his wife's disappearance,

he continued his bizarre
dialog with the media.

As you can see here...

Hey!

Someone's jumpy today.

What are you doing here?

I got to talk to the captain.
Maybe he wants my autograph.

I've become
a media sensation now.

He's gonna suspend you,

without pay is what I hear.

Well, he's gotta do that.

He's gotta protect
the department from

all the B.S.
that's flying around.

I'm sure when it's over,
I'll be back.

There's something
else you don't know.

Lay it on me.

State boys got a court order
to exhume Kathleen.

They're gonna do
another autopsy on her.

Well,
that's a job you don't want,

digging up that corpse, been
in the ground all this time.

Yeah.
I think they ought to just.

Let her rest in peace,
you know?

I mean, this thing's
getting out of hand.

I gotta go see the captain.

Hey, maybe I should
screw with him.

Maybe I should tell him I'm gonna
sue him for wrongful dismissal.

Really see the smoke
come outta his ears.

And finally, Drew,
what's life for you now?

I think my silence has painted
me guilty in the media.

I walk into a room and, you know,
you can hear that kind of hum

with the establishment.

"Drew Peterson's here."

"Drew Peterson, Drew
Peterson, Drew Peterson."

This isn't me. This is...
You know, I'm a jokester.

You know, I'm usually the
guy who's kidding around

and having
a good time, you know,

living life and
all that it brings.

Nineteen years.

Nineteen years on the force,
my wife runs off,

the media gets a hard-on,

and they show you
the door. Sayonara.

It's a raw deal.

That's exactly what it is.

Not that
I'm looking forward to it,

but it might be
a good thing to finally

sleep at nighttime
for a change.

So, this is
a good thing for you.

Well,
it'll be a legal nightmare.

I may have to sell
this to pay for a lawyer.

You haven't
gotten a lawyer yet?

Guy who hasn't done anything
wrong doesn't run to a lawyer.

You still think
Stacy's out there?

It's all
the information I have.

I mean, I think she's
where she wants to be.

I wish she'd pop her head up, put an
end to all this.

2-1-2. New York. Peterson.

It's The Today Show.
They wanna have me on.

Let's start with
NBC's Kevin Tibbles,

who has some new developments
in the investigation into

the death of Drew Peterson's
previous wife.

Kevin, good morning to you.

Good morning, Matt.

While Illinois State Police
continue to search for

the missing fourth
wife of Drew Peterson,

the state's attorney here

has had the body of his third wife
exhumed to perform another autopsy.

Hey, Joe, what's going on?
Did something happen?

Yeah. Something big.

The coroner's
office just released

a new autopsy
on Kathleen Savio.

They're saying that because of
all the bruises on her body,

she was the victim
of a forced drowning,

that she was murdered.

WXIR. Jay in the a.m. It's 8:25.
Good morning, Chicago.

Great to have you aboard. Hey,
special guest in the studio.

It's the notorious
Drew Peterson

who got booted from the Bolingbrook
Police Department last month!

Thanks, Jay.

Well, I'm just telling it like it is, my friend.
You can appreciate that.

No, it's fine. It's my motto.

Well, how are you doing
now that the police have said

maybe you've killed not only
one wife, but maybe two?

Well, they're trying
to make me sweat.

And you know, it's a game.

Now, wouldn't it be easier to
just say you bumped off your wife

than say she left
you for another dude?

Well, but that's what happened.

And Stacy was

irrational and a basket case.

She would ask me for a divorce every
month around her menstrual cycle.

I don't want to
hear about that.

Now, I tell you what,
I'm gonna sponsor a contest.

I am going to find you a woman
that will stick around.

In fact, let's call the contest
"Win A Date With Drew!"

What do you think?

That'll be fine.
I'd be up for that.

You're not worried about
no one entering the contest?

Because, let's face it,

all your wives don't have any
luck in the longevity department.

Well, if they get with me,
they're gonna get lucky.

As long as they're hot.

I'm not sure if we can find
anybody hot on the radio.

Tell you what, the phone
lines are burning up right now.

Let's take some calls. Let's
find you a date here, okay?

WXIR.
Back with more after this.

We have like 40 people
out here searching for Stacy.

Most of them
don't even know her.

So my question is,
where's her husband?

You know,
where the hell is Drew?

I don't know what
the police are doing

but they better start making him
answer some questions like,

"Why aren't you out here
looking for your wife,"

"the mother of your children?"

"You know, children who miss
their mother desperately?"

I mean, if you
think she's still alive,

then why aren't you
out here looking for her?

Drew, the Win
A Date With Drew contest

made all kinds
of news yesterday.

Is the dating
game gonna happen?

Well, hi.
How you doing? No, sir.

It looks like it's
not gonna happen.

And what was
the thinking behind that?

Well, it was all
part of a comedy bit

we were gonna do. It's all
meant to be in good nature.

And they were setting up
contestants for me

and they got so much heat over
it that they pulled the plug.

Drew, you seem so upbeat.

How is it that you
are able to stay upbeat

when your wife has been missing
for so many weeks now?

Well, you know,
you do what you can.

And I'm not gonna sit in a
corner and cry about it.

It's just like, you know, personally,
I grieve, but I do that all alone.

And what about your kids?

How are they feeling
about the disappearance

and what do they
think of the fact

that you have
been named a suspect

in a potential homicide?

Well, the little ones are sad.
They miss their mom.

But, you know, I guess this isn't
what I agreed to talk about.

I didn't agree on any
restrictions on conversation.

In fact, I'd never do that.

Well, then,
I guess I have to walk away.

It's been nice talking to you.
Have a good day.

Well, there you have it.

Drew Peterson, not willing to talk
about his wife's disappearance

but willing to talk
about the dating game.

Whoa, whoa, wait.
So there's no dating game?

Now how are you gonna get laid?

You think I need a stupid
radio program for that?

Come on.
Drew's gotten more tail than

anybody in this
entire bar combined.

He doubts my charismatic power.

Big Daddy's gonna get it done.

Oh, I get a demonstration.

Sorry.
I don't mean to interrupt.

He likes them young,
doesn't he?

And they go for him, too, man.

He studies their body language.

He can tell when
a girl's insecure.

He picks the ones that grew
up in messed-up situations

and are all
desperate for security.

Still, I don't get why
hot chicks go for him.

I know. It's weird.

The guy is an arrogant,
misogynistic ass,

and yet I have fun
hanging around him.

Yeah, don't tell Drew
I said that.

Although if I did say it to his
face, he would probably just laugh.

I think I may have
found wife number five.

Told you.

The strange case of
missing mom Stacy Peterson

has just gotten
a little stranger.

Her husband, Drew, who police
call a suspect in the case,

is now apparently lonely
and looking for love.

Just months after the
disappearance of his last wife,

Drew Peterson has
announced to the world

that he is engaged
to be married again

to single mother Chloe Roberts.

Peterson invited cameras inside
his home to meet his new fiancé.

Miss Roberts is
just 23 years old,

the same age as Stacy Peterson
when she disappeared last October.

When asked about the cloud of suspicion
hanging over her new fiancé,

Miss Roberts expressed
disbelief in the allegations.

No, I don't think he hurt Stacy.
I know him. He's a good dad.

He's got a real good heart,
and he'd never hurt anyone.

So you
feel safe with him?

Yes, of course.

I'm moving in with
him this weekend.

This single mother...

It's like a lamb to slaughter.

I got a call from some
producer in Las Vegas.

I guess they're making a movie
about a whorehouse or something.

They want me to play a security
guard, keep the Johns in line.

Nice.
How perfect would that be?

Why is she doing that?

Don't pay any attention
to her. She's nuts.

I sure hope I don't have to put
up a sign for you one day.

Don't talk to my girlfriend.
Stay outta my life.

I'm in your life until the world
finds out what happened to Stacy,

so get used to it!

I know Stacy
used to come here.

She used to say
the nicest things about you.

Look, I was thinking that you might
want to sponsor a fundraiser.

We still do searches
for her every Saturday.

The media's not interested
in Stacy anymore, you know.

All they want to talk about is
Drew and his new girlfriend.

Yes, I saw that.
Very disturbing.

What?

Stacy confided in me
something about her husband,

and it's weighing very
heavily on me what to do,

whether to go to the police.

It was Drew's night off.

We went to bed together.

But when I woke up in the middle
of the night, he was gone.

I heard him come in,
so I went downstairs to see,

and he was putting
clothes in the wash.

He never did laundry. Never.

That doesn't mean
that he hurt her.

When they found
Kathleen's body,

I asked him where he
had been that night,

and he said, "You know
exactly where I was."

I was so upset.

But then the autopsy came back an accident.
I thought, "Oh, thank God."

It wasn't an accident.

Drew killed Kathleen,

and I think I helped
him get away with it.

And now I think
he's gonna kill me.

You never call.
You never write.

Work's been busy.
It's about to get busier.

There's a big Drew-and-Stacy
story that's about to break.

Thought you might
like a heads-up.

You mean you thought
you'd come here

and try to get a quote from
me before anybody else.

I'd take a few quotes.

All right. What's going on?

Stacy's pastor is gonna be on
Greta Van Susteren tonight.

He'll be saying that Stacy
told him you killed Kathleen.

Chloe.

Chloe, come on!

All of the things they say
about me, all of the things,

and you're gonna let
this one thing bother you?

I can't deal with it anymore.

You got to ignore it.
It's part of a game.

I don't want to
play this game anymore.

I told you I didn't want to go
on TV, and you made me do it.

You told me it was fun.

Everyone I know thinks
I'm pathetic and stupid.

I mean,
I let you cast a spell on me.

I don't know how you do it, but
I can't be this stupid anymore.

Do you know what's stupid?

What would be stupid
would be to let go of

all of the good that we've got.

Drew, you're scaring me.

No, I am the one who's scared,

because you made me
fall in love with you,

and now you're
ripping my heart out.

Everything all right?

I have to go.

At a time when the body of Drew
Peterson's third wife has been exhumed

comes a stunning announcement today
from Stacy Peterson's pastor.

The pastor has
come forward with

allegations that
Stacy confided in him

her fears of being
murdered by her own husband.

The body of Kathleen
Savio was found in...

Where'd you get that opener?

Give it back to me.

I don't think so.

Fine. I'll just
change the code tomorrow.

Do you think
that would stop me?

Going to prison's
gonna stop you.

I'm not going anywhere.

I'm untouchable, bitch.

Tonight, exclusive.

His fourth wife
disappeared without a trace.

His third wife ended up
dead in a bathtub.

And now Drew Peterson
is in the hot seat.

Let's get to it right
now on Larry King Live.

We welcome to Larry King
Live here in Los Angeles.

Drew Peterson,
who is a suspect in

the disappearance of
his fourth wife, Stacy,

and still a question mark over
the death of his third wife.

Why'd you come here, Drew?

I wanted to talk to you

and maybe clear up some
misconceptions in the public.

Are you in love with Stacy?
Very much so.

A lot of people
believe that Stacy is dead.

Think she might be alive?

I do.

Drew, you're a bright guy.

Do you begin to
think that the public

might say that if
it looks like a duck

and it acts like a duck,
it might be a duck?

Well, they don't have all
of the duck's information.

Because if they knew the facts
about me they would know

that there's no way that I could
be involved in any crime.

Head to CNN.corn/LarryKing
and weigh in.

Do you think Stacy Peterson is dead?
We'll be back after the break.

What do you get when you
cross a pig with the media?

Nothing, 'cause there's
some things a pig won't do.

You know, every day I come out
here, there's more flowers,

cards from California, Kansas.

Oh, God.

You think I would
have accepted it by now.

What could you
have done different?

I don't know.

I should've gone over there when
I knew something was wrong.

Why'd they come back?

The same old story,
telling lies about me.

They really think you
killed Stacy, don't they?

The only thing that matters
is that you know the truth.

And you know the truth,
don't you?

That's right.

Glenn, come on. You've got to
start answering your phone.

All right,
I can't have you out there.

Losing your little
mind again. All right?

And I don't want you talking
to those state police guys.

They're idiots, okay?

They're gonna bungle this, and
there's no reason to talk to them.

So call me.
And, remember, we're family.

Illinois State Police,
Detective Franklin.

I remember you and Stacy
at your wedding.

Happy as clams.

And I thought, "Man, they
might actually make it."

I always knew
this day was coming.

Still, cheating on you,
that don't seem like her.

That's exactly like her.

And I know that
we're not blood brothers,

but I always felt
that you and I were

closer than some real brothers.

Yeah, I mean,
you know I love you.

Would you love me if you
thought I killed someone?

I guess I would, I mean...

I kinda always
thought you killed.

Kathleen.

This is my phone.

I want you to hold on to it,

but I do not want
you to answer it.

All right?

I want you to help
me move something.

Do we need gloves?

No.

Meredith, thank you.

Meredith, thank you.

Now to some potentially major
developments in the Stacy Peterson case.

Two Chicago newspapers
are reporting this morning

that a relative
of Drew Peterson

may have unwittingly helped
remove her body from their home.

NBC's Kevin Tibbles has the latest on that.
Hi, Kevin. Good morning.

Startling revelations
this morning, Matt,

that a relative of Drew Peterson
allegedly told a friend

he helped Peterson carry a...

...disappearance
of Stacy Peterson.

The young Illinois mother
vanished last October,

and her husband
remains a suspect.

He is the Romeo who
was either extremely

unlucky with women
or something worse.

...that Drew did
something to my sister.

This is just more proof, and I
think they should arrest him.

Illinois police sergeant Drew
Peterson has been named a suspect

in her disappearance and is
now under renewed scrutiny

in the death of
his previous wife.

How much more do
the police need

before they move in
to make an arrest?

They have his
stepbrother saying...

"I helped carry Stacy's
body out of the house."

Stacy told me she
was afraid of him.

She was afraid that
he would kill her.

She said to me,
"I'm already dead,"

and those were her exact words.

If anything happened to her,
it's because he killed her.

And he'll make it
look like an accident.

And I think they should arrest him.
He needs to be arrested.

He killed her. She was
afraid that he was gonna kill her.

He held me down... She
said to me, "I'm dead already."

...and put his
hands around my neck.

He should be locked up.
He needs to be arrested.

I was already dead.
The guy's dangerous.

He killed her. Killer.

Zach, I need you to watch the gang.
I got to go buy some luggage.

Daddy's headed to
Vegas to be a TV star.

I thought you were
already a TV star.

Well, I'm a media sensation,
but there's no money in that.

You're only a star when
they pay you to be on TV.

Please, just answer
one quick question.

Over here, Drew, over here.

You're wasting your time, guys.

I'm not leaving for
Vegas till tomorrow.

We better go catch up.

This is it, Karen, the day
you've been waiting for.

Get out of the car and put
your hands where I can see them.

Drew Peterson, I have a
warrant for your arrest

for the murder
of Kathleen Savio.

I guess I should have
returned those library books.

Hey, Drew! What do you
have to say now, Drew?

Guys, make sure you get my good side.
Have a look at my new bling.

You have the right
to remain silent.

Anything you say
can and will be

used against you
in a court of law.

You have
the right to an attorney.

If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

Beginning with
breaking news in Illinois.

Former police sergeant Drew
Peterson has been indicted

in the murder of his third
wife, Kathleen Savio,

and he was arrested hours ago
during this traffic stop.

Peterson also remains the prime
suspect in the disappearance

of his fourth wife,
Stacy Peterson.

1400 hours commence rec...

I was gonna be
state police myself,

till I found out that
my mother and father

would also have to be brother
and sister, so ruled me out.

You know the drill,
Mr. Peterson. Strip.

See, now I get it.

You just want to have
a look at my package.

Well, I can make that happen.

No problem.
