Hello?

Hello.

<i>Hi.</i>

[MUSICAL CHIMES]

How are you? Fine. You?

Fine. Good!


Where's the gate?

Bye.

Bye.

[IN EFFEMINATE VOICE] You know,
when Sonny gets an idea in his head...

he's just a mad man.
I thought he was gonna kill me.

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Attica!

[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]


BOY:
Whoo!

You're Billy's sister, right?
Yeah.

You seen him around?

Oh, Ollie.
Speak of the devil.

Yeah. Come on, man.
I told you, not here.

OLLIE:
I'm sorry, man.

I forgot what you said.
BILLY: All right. Hey, go see Dad, yeah?

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

â™ªâ™ª

CONRAD:
William Wyatt.

My name is Conrad Sean Lewis.
You will call me Mr. Lewis.

<i>BILLY: And the uncles,
the aunts, the cousins...</i>

<i>nieces, the nephews
that lived in those walls.</i>

<i>A gibbering pack of tree apes
that said nothing, nothing, nothing...</i>

<i>and said it loud, loud, loud.</i>

Let me be the first
to welcome you to the BCFB.

After you.

BOY 1:
There's a new guy.

CONRAD: You're in luck.
You're just in time for dinner.

Table 4, Elvis.


[FORK TAPPING]

Stand up, new boy.

Stand up.

BOY 2:
Ooh...


Were you eyeballing me, new boy?

I don't know, but I
don't think I was, sir.

Did I say you could talk?

BILLY: You kind of implied permission, sir.
What?

The implication was that
you wanted an answer.

When I want an answer,
I will tell you, understood?!

I just asked you a question,
new boy!

Certainly even you, sir, can see
how confusing this is becoming.

[BOYS MURMURING]

BOY 3:
Chill, chill, chill.

Lucky.

MONTGOMERY:
You've been here exactly five minutes.

That's an impressive beginning and
an ominous portent of things to come.

My name is Montgomery De La Cruz, the
director at the Bernville Camp for Boys.

I wanna welcome you.
I know it might seem hollow...

because there's got to be
some other place you'd rather be.

Isn't there?

I'm waiting.
Some other place I'd rather be...

Some places, sure.
A simple yes or no will suffice.

Yes.
Thank you.

But you didn't do very well in those other
places you'd rather be, now, did you?

That's hard to say, sir. I haven't actually
been to some of the places I'd rather be.

BOY 4:
Tough guy over here.

Come with me.


BOY 5: What made him think
he can get away with this?

BOY 6: Get out of here, man.
Eat in silence.

[CHATTERING STOPS]

Now, Mr. Wyatt, you and I are
gonna engage in witty byplay...

but perhaps when you have
a tad less energy...

and not in front
of the general population.

Do we understand each other?

I doubt it, sir.

You're a very clever boy, Billy.

We don't get
a lot of clever boys here.

I imagine you're gonna be
a very refreshing challenge.

But be careful. I think it was
Albert Camus who said...

that a man can hang himself
with too much cleverness.

Yes, sir. Yeah.
We'll see you tomorrow.

Ooh. Actually, it wasn't Camus
who said that.

It was Billy the Kid.

Good night, sir.

NATHAN:
Hey, that took some balls, man.

I'm Nathan Stein.

Billy.

So, what did you do?
Yeah.

I burnt my parents' house down.
Oh, okay.

What about you?

Dope, cars, rock 'n' roll.

Yeah. Dope.


You all right?
BOY 1: Oh, shut your mouth.

Yeah.

[BOY 2 SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

I'm the sickly one.

Every institution needs one, right?
Yeah.

I read that in the brochure.
BOY 1: Why don't you faggots kiss...

so we can get some sleep?
Good night, Billy.

â™ªâ™ª

OLLIE:
I'm sorry, man. I forgot what you said.

Hey, go see Dad, yeah?

Hey, it's cool, man.

But I'm gonna push you a little bit
for talking to my little sister.

My dad's in the car over there.

You got them all fooled,
don't you, man? Whoa.

Bet your dad's real proud of you.

Hello, Sweets.
MAGGIE: Hello.

How are you? How was school?
It was all right.

Hey.
BILLY: Hey.

[BELL RINGING]

[BOYS RAPPING AND CHATTERING]

LIONEL: Everyone turn to Page 55
where we left off.

Oh, wow.

Page 55. You guys must have been
at this for months.

Shut up.

"With school turning out more
runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers...

grabbers, snatchers..."

[BILLY CLAPPING]

Mr. Wyatt? Your first day, right?

I can get you caught up
if you haven't read this.

Oh, I read it.

Okay. Then it shouldn't be a problem
for you to continue with today's reading.

Please. Bring your book
and come up front.

[BOYS MURMURING]

BOY 1:
Gay James Dean.

"Grabbers, snatchers, fliers
and swimmers...

instead of examiners." Critics...

knowers and imaginative creators.

The word "intellectual," of course...

became the swear word
it deserved to be.

Class, you may write "shit, yeah"
in the margins.

LIONEL:
Enough editorializing, Mr. Wyatt.

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

You always dread the unfamiliar.

We must all be alike.

Not everyone born free and equal.

Yeah, because freedom can suck my...
LIONEL: Mr. Wyatt.

[BOYS LAUGHING]

Your knowledge of the book
is impressive, but I'm warning you.

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

Gentlemen.

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

[BOYS LAUGHING]

When you're ready to take this seriously,
I will welcome you back.

But for now, get out.

[BOYS JEERING AND CHATTERING]

BOY 2: Get out, boy! Get out!
BOY 3: Yeah!

BOY 2:
Get out!

BOY 4: Oh, no, come back.
BOY 3: Yeah!

If you all find Mr. Wyatt so amusing, all
of you, get the hell out of my classroom.

Come on, man. We didn't do nothing.
I'm not cleaning up rocks.

CONRAD:
I understand this gathering...

comes courtesy
of everyone's favorite funny man.

Billy Wyatt.
BOY 1: What's up with this guy?

Now...

here's what you sweethearts
are gonna do.

You're gonna move all these rocks
at the bottom...

up there.
They're in my way down here.

Now, I don't know how many rocks
exactly will fit up there...

so it's possible a few
might have to come back down.

But we'll see.

Maybe by then...

Billy won't seem so funny anymore.
BILLY: How's this for funny?

A rabbi, a priest and a hooker...
Hooker.... walk into a bar.

Now, the bartender, he's like,
"This is a joke, right?"

[IN DEEP VOICE] Oh, no, no. No.
I know you're out there, Conrad.

I can smell you breathing.
Word of advice.

Shut the hell up.

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
That is four words, technically.

BOYS:
Ooh...

BOY 2:
Damn.

Anybody else?
BOY 2: Damn.

â™ªâ™ª

Hey, let me ask you something.

BILLY:
Ask away.

How'd you do that thing in class?

When you looked up from your book
and kept reading...

like you had it memorized.
I did, you know. I mean, I do.

I have this memory thing.
Eidetic memory.

I'm supposed to know
what that means?

If I read something or see a picture
of something just once...

it sticks with me forever,
with perfect clarity.

That's awesome.
Oh, you think so?

How'd you like to have the menu
of IHOP on 23rd and Broadway...

dancing around in your head 24/7?

Got it from my father. He has it.

Bet your dad's pretty pissed
at you now, huh?

Yeah.

Let me ask you something else,
Mr. Memory.

BILLY: Yeah?
What's that Greek myth...

with the guy in... That carries...
Sisyphus.

Yeah. He pushed the rock up that hill.
Great story.

He carries rocks up the hill
for 20 years.

He got, as you can imagine,
completely buff.

A Greek princess falls in love with him.
They get married.

He mounts her atop Olympus on
the hourly basis until he dies at 200...

after which, they made him a god.
Really?


No.

Shit.

NATHAN: Billy, you're bleeding.
Huh?

NATHAN:
On your back.

BILLY:
Whoa.

You fell, funny man.

Go to the infirmary.

WOMAN:
I tell you what, Dwayne.

I have a job. So you don't need
to send me those checks...

that you weren't
even sending me anyway.

[PHONE RECEIVER THUDS]

How long you been sitting there?
I don't know.

What's wrong with you?

I got a kind of cut on my back.
Take off your shirt.

Just like that? Not gonna
ask me out to dinner first?

At least tell me I'm pretty.

What's your name?
Billy.

Nurse Simms.
Now, off with that shirt, bright eyes.

Oh, man.

That bad?

What happened?

I fell.

Uh-huh.

We have a falling epidemic here.

Just gonna clean it.

BILLY:
Do I need stitches?

I don't know. I don't think so.

That's good because I hate needles.

Me too.

Turn around.

â™ªâ™ª

Can you breathe okay?

I don't know.
Feels like I broke something.

Rest.

[BUZZER SOUNDS]


All right, so the black guys
don't talk to the Latino guys.

And the skinheads don't talk to
the black guys or the Latino guys.

And nobody talks to the crackers.

I love clichÃ©s.
Yeah.

And nobody but nobody
talks to me.

I'll talk to you, Nathan.
I'll talk your goddamn ear off.

You're crazier than I thought, man.

See that guy? It's Carlos Fuentes.

He's the alpha dog, <i>El</i> Gato.
How can he be the alpha dog...

and called The Cat?
His moniker contradicts his position.

Because he shot a guy. In the eye.

Behind a Five Guys. He shot him
with a burger in his mouth.

Jesus.

And they put him in here?
Yeah. Mexican Mafia.

He's totally connected.
That shit is far-reaching.

Some kind of family thing, I think.

You got your pads on all backwards, bro.
Oh.

Thanks. Am I good?
Yeah.

All right.

[WHISTLE BLOWS]

BOY 1:
Yo, Nathan got J.T.'s old helmet.

[BOYS LAUGHING]

BOY 2:
Make him the waterboy.

MAN: All right. For those of you
who just recently joined the team...

my name is Coach Carmichael.

You might remember me from my days
playing linebacker for the Eagles.

All right. Football...

If he says football is a lot like life...
COACH: Football is a lot like...

I'll barf blood on his cleats.
A lot like life.

[BILLY RETCHING
THEN NATHAN SNICKERS]

You find something funny, Stein? Hm?

No, sir. No.

Since you like to laugh so much,
maybe we crack you up officially. Dye.

BOY 3: Yeah, J.T. Show him what's up!
BOY 4: Here's your tough guy.

You ball?
I was defensive end...

back at Erasmus Hall. Yeah.

I broke a dude's collarbone
so I got kicked off the team.

Part of the game.

He was our quarterback, so...

Son, you got Eagle potential.

A little one-on-one.

See if you can blow past Mr. Dye.
Run to daylight, pussy.

Sir, Nathan is a pussy.
He's a international pussy.

He's a real-deal pussy.

I, on the other hand...
BOYS: Ooh!

Damn.
BOY 5: Yo, that's my boy right there.

BOY 6:
Get up. Get up, son.

What'd you say?
BILLY: Nothing.

BOY 3: Like a rag doll.
BOY 5: You want another one?

He just said something nasty
about your mama.

BOYS: Ooh...
Oh, is that right?

â™ªâ™ª

Do it again.

BOYS:
Ooh!

Down!
BOY 7: Yeah, J.T.

What'd you say about my mama?
Nothing.

But you hit me like that again,
I might.

I think I busted something.

BOYS:
Oh...

BOY 8:
Son of a...

BOY 9:
Peas from last weekend.

I bet you won't be
verbing me no more.

Verbing? Would that be
in the eyeballing family, sir?

Do it again.
BOY 10: Come on, man.


BOY 11:
Do it, J.T., do it.

BOY 12:
Man.

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

Nah, I guess I wouldn't.

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

COACH: Again.
Stay down.

BOYS:
Ooh...

Do it again.

BOYS:
Ooh...

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

Again.

BOYS:
Ooh...

Do it again. Again.

BOYS:
Ooh...

BOY 13:
Straight embarrassing.


BOY 14:
This is getting ridiculous now, man.

Do it again.

BOY 15:
Oh, man.

COACH: What are you doing?
BOY 15: He's done. He's done, man.

COACH:
Hey!

Get back here!

Nice hit, Mr. Dye.

<i>BILLY: "Why is it," he said, one time
at the subway entrance...</i>

<i>"I feel I've known you
so many years?"</i>

<i>"Because I like you," she said.
"And I don't want anything from you."</i>

You smell nice.

Like morning.

Don't.

<i>Okay.</i>

Whatever you did...

you're too smart to be in here.

You wanna talk about it?

You have a first name?

I sure do.

You let me know
if you change your mind.

â™ªâ™ª

Come on.

Conrad.

You got me the job.
Lord knows I need it.

And I will do it,
but I will not do you.

Not again. We've been down
that road before, Connie.

And it was a really short, boring trip.

[TILL CHUCKLES]

â™ªâ™ª

[DOOR HANDLE RATTLING]


<i>â™ª I'm not gonna listen â™ª</i>

Hey, Emmit.
Dance with Conrad, will you?

I don't dance.
The last time I danced was with my wife...

and she danced right out the door,
which is where I'm headed.

Y'all have a good night.

<i>â™ª Big trucks are whining â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª On the pavement floor â™ª</i>

Damn.

Take it easy.

BILLY:
Y'all need...

mm...

an IHOP.

No, y'all need
to find another place to sit.

That's what I'm saying. Y'all had
an IHOP, I'd be in there having...

the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity.
Instead, I got this.

Bernville, in all its downtown
downtrodden splendor.

Where you need to be at, son?

Don't get all existential on me, officer.

I'm gonna ask you one more time.

Where you need to be?

The Bernville Camp for Boys.
Get in the car!

Shotgun.
In the back, boy.

Let me see if I got this straight.

You broke out of camp tonight
so that I could take you back tonight?

And why, you ask? Well...

why did Sir Edmund Hillary
climb Mount Everest? Uh...

Why do dogs lick their balls?

Why did Sir Edmund lick his balls
at the summit?

So, what did you do
to land yourself in there?

Shot a man in Reno.

You're a little too young
to know about Johnny Cash.

My dad taught me.

And what does he do?

Next caller, please.

You may wanna die, but I don't.
Put that smoke out.

[TIRES SCREECH]

I suspect respect
is your biggest problem, son.

And if you lucky,
somebody won't have to beat it into you.

Now, that ain't my style.

But I ain't too old to change.

Get this cleaned up...

and me and you gonna be okay.

Yes, sir.

[ROCK MUSIC
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

<i>â™ª Blow out your candle
It will not... â™ª</i>

[MUSIC STOPS]

Let's go, sweetheart.
BILLY: Unh.

CONRAD: Compliments of Mr. Wyatt's
late-night outing...

he will be wearing
the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo!

He will wear it today,
tomorrow and for as long as I say!

This is not the only tuxedo
I have in stock, Mr. Dye.

Any one of you even think
about going AWOL, Mr. Stein...

I will outfit all you fish in a flash.

Now, back to your spades.

Spade.

BOY 1: Look at his eye.
BOY 2: Hey, yo, chill out.

NATHAN: Hey, Bill.
BOY 3: This good? Like this?

Here.

Uh, I stole it from breakfast.

What is all this?

It's the community
construction program.

I've been here for like two months...

and nobody seems to know
what the hell we're building.

BOY 4: Coming through, coming through.
Whose sweet ride?

It's Montgomery's.

It's his pride and joy.
He'd have sex with it if he could.

Maybe I'm giving him too much credit.

Maybe he has.
Mm-hm.

You better hide that shit.

Hey, if you could have sex with any car,
what kind of car would it be?

Phantom.

But, you know, I'd be thinking
about a Jag so, you know...

Yeah, I know.

Ahh. The fruit juice of human kindness.

I want you boys to drop down
and give me 50.

Please and thank you very much.

I'm waiting.

I believe you boys
were admiring my automobile?

In the parlance of the street,
she's cherry.

Now, you guys are light years from this,
but we do have a trustee program...

that allows those who get in
the program and stay in the program...

the privilege of working on my car...

and drinking lemonade
as the sun sets.

It's an incentive program, if you will.

Mr. Wyatt, how many is that?


Eight percent.

I want another 50.

CONRAD: Come on, Stein,
I haven't seen you do one good one yet.

Don't make me help you!

Push with your arms!
I can't.

CONRAD:
Push! Give me one fucking good one!

[NATHAN WHIMPERING]

Push! Come on, you weakling.

One fucking push-up. Two...

three, four. You waste of space.

Push! All day! We'll do this all day!

LIONEL: "'Everyone must leave
something behind when he dies'...

[BILLY WHEEZING]

Oh, wow, if it's Bernville,
and it's autumn and it's after 6, ooh...

don't be caught dead without
the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo.

Made from the finest Dacron in Akron,
rubber capital of the world.

It is smart, dashing and now,
the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo.

If you gotta be bad, but you wanna
look good, this is the tux for you...

and you, and you and you.

It comes in a rainbow of colors,
red, yellow, tan and brown.

The Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo!

It is a veritable clusterfuck of a tux.

Any takers? Five ninety-nine.

It's 7.99 at Walmart.
What about you fellas over here?

No? No takers? You guys over here?
Rainbow of colors. Rainbow.

Oh. Jeez.

You can't sit here, man.
I can't and...

And yet I am.

I just wanna say thanks, man.

For what,
carrying your weak ass to the Infirmary?

No, no, no. This morning at the site,
you came to check on me.

What?

You were checking on my well-being
after my night out. It was very Oprah.

Seven-thirty, just spew this shit out.
Oh, oh.

I'm a vessel. This shit just comes to me
from the universe.

I put it back out there.
I'm a channeler. I see things.

It's what I do. Hold on.
J.T.: Believe this shit?

I'm pretending I'm Christ trying to
get the waiter back at my table...

at the Last Supper.
I just found a fly in my fish.

CVS.
CVS what?

"CVS what?" "CVS wh..."
CVS, man, the drugstore chain.

You're a regional manager by 40.

Yeah, you'll train somewhere
in northern Virginia...

but you end up back in Pennsylvania.
Three perfect kids, a beautiful wife.

You'll be living on Philly Main Line
adjacent and driving a Jag.

Doing your best not to bang it.

Oh... You're just begging to get beat,
you know that?

That's bullshit, man.

Uh-oh. Six Flags! Six Flags!

<i>BILLY:
We need not to be let alone.</i>

<i>We need to be really bothered
once in a while.</i>

<i>How long is it since you were really
bothered about something important?</i>

<i>About something real.</i>

Ray, you are the shit.

Get up and get out of that.
Where am I going?

You got a visitor.
Forget it.

I can't. You ought to see her,
true piece.

I don't have all day, Wyatt.
Mm-hm.

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

CONRAD:
Mrs. Wyatt.

Billy.

Permission to return to population, sir?

Sit down, son.
Go to hell.

Okay, I'm gonna sit.

Will you get your hands off me?
Okay, okay!

There. Yeah, thank you!

MRS. WYATT: Billy, I just... I've...
I've been thinking about you.

[VOICE BREAKING] I just wanted
to know if you were okay, and I drove...

Nobody asked you to.

Is everything all right?

I just wanted to see my son.

BILLY:
Permission to return to population, sir.

Jesus Christ, Billy,
please stop staying that.

I know, I know
I've made mistakes, but...

Permission to return to population!

MONTGOMERY:
Okay, all right, Billy. Come with me.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Wyatt.
Just give me a minute.

Hey, hey, hey.
BILLY: What?

So, what's the story?
There's no story.

Yeah, but she's your mother.
That's not my fault.

MONTGOMERY:
So you won't talk to her?

BILLY: No, I'm not gonna talk to her.
CONRAD: Here you go, ma'am.

BILLY: You can throw me back
in there, but you cannot open my eyes.

MONTGOMERY:
Maybe not this time.

What do you want me to do,
want me to handle it?

Yeah. Please.

All right. All right, man.
Pl... Thank you.


Mrs. Wyatt. Uh...
Yes.

I'm sorry, he just...

He just doesn't wanna talk to you.
No, no, I'm sorry.

Sometimes these boys
need extra time to adjust.

You can't blame yourself for it.
I know.

Uh-huh. Okay, I should go.

Sorry.

I'll walk you to the car.

Here you go.
Thank you.

BILLY:
Whoa.

Does Conrad know about this place?

CARLOS:
Yeah.

And he's cool with it?

Yeah. Conrad's an idiot,
but he ain't stupid.

He knows outside this place
there's more of me than him.

So Conrad makes allowances.

Conrad, Carnalito, is a pussy.

He's a pussy for you, <i>El</i> Gato.

For Guillermo,
he's a pussy with a whip.

That douchebag's liable to bury me.

Isn't that what you want, Guillermo?

What are you, high?

Yeah.

But I'm right.

Why you wanna die so bad?

Huh?

What did you do?

Nothing.

Man, you come in here
taunting the bull, man...

in the center of the ring.
Calling Conrad out on his shit.

Whoa.

Going head to head with J.T.

BILLY: Jesus, man.
Messing with De La Cruz.

What is this shit?
De La Cruz, man, heh, El Diablo.

I don't know
about Montgomery anymore.

That's the devil's greatest trick.

What you doing in here, Billy? You best
let that shit out before it eats you alive.

What did you do, Billy?

I gotta know.

BILLY:
My mother was here today.

I can't even look at her.

How do you ever go home?


Fuck!

Hey, hey. Don't.


[SIREN CHIRPS]

Oh, man.

What the hell, Billy?

Good evening, Sheriff Till.

Get in the car, Billy.

Yeah, see you around, officer.

WOMAN [OVER RADIO]:
Sheriff <i>Till?</i>

<i>When you're done there,
we need you back at the station.</i>

You know what I think, Billy?

Any father who teaches his kid
about Johnny Cash...

things ain't so bad.
You know what?

You do not talk to me
about my father, okay?

And you don't talk about me.
You don't know me.

Well, you talk to me
like a gentleman, Billy...

or you shut the hell up.
Come on, Billy.

I don't belong in there, man.

Things happened that shouldn't
have happened. They just...

kept happening.
What things?

Oh, come on. Why does everybody
wanna know all of a sudden?

Because they figure
it's written all over your face.

I can't say it. I don't...
What do you want me to say?

I don't know what to say.

Fair enough.
Yeah.

Yeah, I'm messed up here, officer.

Come on, Billy, stop. Billy. Shit!

No, no, no. Come on, just let me go.
Come on.

Look, what are you doing?
No. What...?

Come on, Billy. Come on,
calm down. Come on.

BILLY:
Come on, man. No one's gonna care.

TILL:
Come on, Billy.

Let me go!

TILL:
I still gotta take you back, Billy.

BILLY: You don't know what goes on
in that place.

Sure I do.

No, you think you know the Bernville
Camp for Boys, but you don't, man.

Life is the Bernville Camp for Boys.

Oh, Jesus Christ. If you're winding up
for the heavy meaning-of-life pitch...

you'll have to do better than that.
Know what? Shut up and listen to me.

Yes, sir.

All right?
Yes, sir. I'll shut up and listen to you.

High school is
the Bernville Camp for Boys.

Afghanistan? The desert version.

The police academy
was the Bernville Camp for Boys.

Hell, my marriage was a lot like that.

The whole world
is a Bernville Camp for Boys, Billy...

and the only way out is through.

That's bullshit.

The only way out is to not get in.

Well, you've managed to get yourself in,
and I've gotta take you back.

I know.
Yeah.

Can I ask you something?

What?

You gonna finish that?

[DOO-WOP MUSIC
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

Stay down, Billy. Stay down.

This is it.
BILLY: Mm-hm.

Home sweet home.

Take care of yourself, kid.
Yeah. See you soon.

I'm pretty sure you will.

NATHAN:
I feel like I'm shitting a river of fire.

Nathan, man, why don't you let me
take you to the infirmary?

I got juice. I could hook you up
with a bed with a view.

Because the first time I complained,
Conrad said that I was faking...

and that if I bitched again,
I wouldn't be faking anymore.

Yeah, but I could talk to Nurse Simms.
She'll listen to me.

Nurse Simms? You mean
Mother Teresa on animal tranqs?

Oh, yeah, I know...

[DOOR OPENS]

I told you, Stein.

You shit twice a day,
morning and night.

Sometimes these things
are beyond our control, Conrad.

Out! You pull up those pants
and get out of here right now!

I can't. It won't... It won't stop.

You slam that sphincter shut
and get on your feet...

or I will kick you so hard,
you'll shit from your eyes!

An image you could've kept to yourself.
Get that goddamn bucket!

Give me that bucket, Wyatt!

BILLY:
Damn it, Conrad!

CONRAD: You shit off my schedule,
you will shit in my bucket!

BILLY: Conrad!
Please.

Not to pull focus from Nathan here,
but let me ask you something.

In your trailer,
how do you live with yourself?

You shut your mouth.
For example...

at night, after you've tried to throw
a jack, but you can't get it up...

and the loneliness settles in.
CONRAD: Shut up.

You realize you're nothing but
a Cro-Magnon fleck of worthlessness...

who can only get his nut off
by watching a sick kid shit in a bucket.

How do you live with yourself, Connie?


You shit in that bucket!
This bucket is your friend, faggot!

You will take this bucket with you
wherever you go!


â™ªâ™ª

Permission to use
the laundry room, sir?

Thank you.

â™ªâ™ª

Stop! Stop!

Get off of me. Stop!

Stop.

You and me, Jew lover.

Relax. Boys will be boys.

[BOYS COUGHING]

BILLY: Carlos, thanks for
having my back last night.

[CARLOS & BILLY
SPEAK IN SPANISH]

What are you gonna do
when you get out of here?

Get thrown back in.

But not here though.

In with the big boys.

It's cool though.

Top of the heap, you know?

Okay. Um...

Let's say fate was kind.

Okay. Fate's a fucking magician.

I'm gonna feel the wind in my face...

and the silk of thighs
wrapped around my neck...

like the wings of angels.

You...

<i>are</i> no <i>longer El Gato.</i>

Yeah. That's your day job.

<i>But at night, en la noche...</i>

you're reading your poetry
at Papalote's...

while the chicks from Marin...

mm-hm...

they're swallowing your yarn.
You're getting more kitty than a vet.

Ooh-whee. Aw...

[BILLY SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

Take me with you.

<i>BILLY: We cannot tell the precise
moment when friendship is formed.</i>

<i>As in filling a vessel drop by drop...</i>

<i>there's at last a drop
which makes it run over.</i>

<i>So in a series of kindnesses...</i>

<i>there is at last one,
which makes the heart run over.</i>


Nathan, what are you doing?

I'm having the perfect dream.

I'm 7 in Michigan. Genesee County.

And I'm with my parents at this place.

I think it's called something like, um...

the Miracle Twin Drive-In
or something.

And I'm in my pajamas
in the backseat of the car.

And I'm in that state where
I'm not really asleep.

I'm not fully awake.

And...

next thing I know, I wake up
and it's morning, and I'm in my bed.

I have no idea how I got there.

And next door, I can hear
our neighbor cutting the grass.

Nathan...

why'd you burn
your parents' house down?

There was some bad shit
happening with my sister.

[NATHAN COUGHING]

My father would...

He'd do stuff to her.

And my mom wouldn't believe her.

So I stole all my mom's jewelry...

and sold it and gave the money
to my sister.

And she took off.

And I couldn't go back.

So I burned their house down.

Figured it would be
a nice goodbye present.


I'm sorry.

You got a sister, Billy?

No.

Hey, I didn't...
I didn't burn it down all the way.

I just kind of...

This would be a weird place to die.

Don't you think?

[COUNTRY MUSIC
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

BILLY: Mags, what are
your five favorite movies, right?

And do not say Twilight in this car.

Fine.

<i>Remember Me.</i>

<i>The Runaways.</i>

<i>Uh, Water for Elephants.</i>

<i>Valentine's Day.</i>

<i>And the</i> fifth would <i>have been
Snow White and the Huntsman.</i>

But we all know what happened...
TouchÃ©. TouchÃ©.

<i>â™ª If they ask me â™ª</i>

Ask me my five favorite films.
Where's this coming from?

It's what I was thinking about in Trig.
Number one, Scarface.

Two, Godfather! and II,
which I count as one.

<i>Three, Bronx Tale. Four, 8 Mile.</i>

<i>Five, Boyz n the Hood.</i>

Heh. You know you're white, right?


Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, don't, no. Oh, I love, yes.

Oh, come on.

<i>â™ª Or hang around for you' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Well, I make it pretty good
Until that moon comes shinin' through â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And then I get
So doggone lonesome â™ª</i>

I'm sure you know
what you're talking about.


You know, Nathan,
you really look like shit.

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

MONTGOMERY:
Gentlemen, please. Gentlemen.

It has come to my attention that this
year's community construction project...

has, shall we say, stagnated.

What the hell was it
supposed to be anyway?

I have no idea.

MONTGOMERY: This was supposed to
be something created by you as a group.

Something of lasting value.

He'll say "future generations."
MONTGOMERY: Something for posterity.

I'm slipping.

MONTGOMERY: Groups of the past
have chosen to construct...

a large double-truck recycling bin for
the St. Thomas Fundamentalist Church.

We've had a backstop for
the Will Stevens Memorial softball field...

over at Redding.

And my favorite,
from the fall of '09 population...

a pair of oak picnic tables
with matching benches...

for the Pennsylvania Lenape.

Now, I don't know.

Maybe this year's project
of the outdoor chapel...

"Outdoor chapel"?

Has just not been
as inspiring as I'd hoped it'd be.

But never in the history
of the Bernville Camp for Boys...

have we not completed a project.

Now, I am more than open
to hearing suggestions...

as to how we might gain
some inspiration in moving this forward.

And you may discuss this
amongst yourselves.

But make no mistake...

this project will be completed by you
one way or another.

So get on it, gentlemen.

You have two weeks.

Sir. Sir. Sir.
BOYS: Oh...

We know right now.
We know exactly what we wanna build.

We do?
BILLY: We do.

Sir, in the spirit of the Bernville Camp
for Boys' outdoor chapel...

I'm picking up a transcendental vibe
from the entire group.

And I feel more than confident in saying
we'd like to jump the tracks, if you will...

and build right here on the premises,
for posterity and future generations...

our very own drive-in movie theater.

[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

MONTGOMERY: Yes, but...
That's very interesting.

But we don't have cars here,
so what would be the point?

Okay, no cars, right. Literal crowd.
But, come on, I mean...

Well, can we give it up and let go for the
Bernville Camp for Boys movie theater?

Come on now!
BOY 1: Yeah!

Come on, who's got the spirit today,
boys? I got the spirit today!

Can I get an "amen"?
BOY 2: Amen.

Can I get a "hallelujah"?
BOY 3: Hallelujah.

BILLY:
That's right, boys! Give it up!

[BILLY WHOOPING]

I'm talking about our very own...

nostalgia-laden, kickass...

blast from the past, customized...

glamorized, actual-sized!

Give it up, hermanos, and brothers
and Fourth Reichians! Give it up!

Give it up!

Amen!
BOYS: Amen!

Hallelujah!
BOYS: Hallelujah!

Amen!
BOYS: Amen!

Hallelujah!
BOYS: Hallelujah!

That was a terrific speech, Billy.

Terrific. Tell you what I'm gonna do.

You boys build it, and I'm gonna find us
a projection system. How about that?

BOY 4: Yeah.
BOY 5: Yeah!

MONTGOMERY:
That was...

That was really wonderful, Billy.

It was really, really inspiring.

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

Can I get an "amen"
one more time, brothers?

Hallelujah!

So now what, valiente?
What?

What you mean, "what?"
This is your damn idea, fool.

Yeah, exactly. I brought the idea.
I'm the genesis. I'm...

I'm the well from which
the idea for the theater sprung.

Beyond that, I have nothing.
I have no actual skills.

NATHAN:
Wait, we know how.

Earl knows.

Go ahead, man. Tell him.

Don't be putting your hands on me.
Yeah, well, then come on, bitch!

Whoa, whoa! Jesus Christ.
J.T.: What's up?

It's for the movie theater, damn it.

J.T., chill.

Just bend over.

Or tilt. At least tilt.

Can I just-J'? Just a tilt.

Thank you.

Holy shit.

EARL:
It's a pretty simple design.

My grandfather designed a bunch
of drive-ins before they shot his ass.

The Circle Drive-In in Scranton?

That's his.

I got blown there once. Or twice.
BOY: Yeah, right.

That's a lovely visual.
Earl, just continue.

EARL: <i>Need about 12 sheets of
one-inch thick marine-grade plywood.</i>

We have that already.

<i>About four times as many
truss clamps.</i>

<i>About 242-by-6s.
That'd give us our base.</i>

<i>And about nine 2-by-4s to shore it up.</i>

Oh, we're gonna need some
laminated acetate for the screen.

Where are we gonna get that?

<i>BILLY:
Sheets. We could use sheets?</i>

<i>EARL:
Yup. Sheets will work.</i>

Sheets will work. Sheets will work.

A little push.

What do you think, man?

Yeah. I know.


You okay?

No. No.

Should I get the bucket?
No. Screw the bucket.

[IN EFFEMINATE VOICE]
Oh, it's time for Screw the Bucket.

I'm your host RuPaul
on this week's edition.

Shut up, Billy. Not now, man.

Guard.

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Guard!

You know, actually,
I think I'm feeling a little better.

Well, I think you look a little better.

And that is my
informed medical opinion.

I'm just a little tired though.

Then I prescribe...

sleep.

He came in with bronchitis
and an intestinal infection.

It's just getting worse.

He's a pretty sick kid, Billy.

Then why isn't he in a hospital?

Um, I've got orders.

You're a nurse.

And I'm just learning
to live by the rules.

Until my shit is straight,
I've gotta do what I'm told.

Gotcha.

How long have you been clean
or straight or you know?

Seven months and 18 days.

I keep waiting...

for the hunger to stop.

I keep waiting...

to be still.

I keep waiting like a good girl.

I keep waiting...

for you to say something.

Maybe you can't get really found...

until you get really lost.

No.

Please.

Sorry. That's just too weird.

I mean, I'm supposed to be a nurse.

You're supposed to be a kid.

And that's just...
That's too weird, even for me.

Weird isn't wrong.

I know. I know.

Sometimes it's amazing.

And sometimes it is wrong.

And sometimes it's both.

Like now?

Yes.

Neither of us needs
any more weirdness, Billy.

I'm sorry.

It's not like I've never
heard "no" before.

â™ªâ™ª

It's not "no." It's... It's "wait."

What's up, Montay? Montiago.

<i>Montel Williams. The Full Monty.</i>

You know, your work with the outdoor
theater was really, really impressive.

I really, really didn't do that much.

I think you've done
a lot more than you realize.

Oh. Okay.

Is there a tux on my golden horizon?
No. No.

But I'm impressed.

I'm so impressed that
I'm gonna assign you trustee status.

Does that mean that I get to get out
of this hellhole early? No offense.

None taken. And not exactly.
Come here.

I wanna show you something.

I want you to meet...

The White Goddess.

Monty? We have to get you a woman.

I want you to care for her
like she's truth and beauty on wheels.

I can do that.

You know, I employ three
different types of polishes on her...

throughout the year.

In the fall, a medium carnauba,
and it's always...

You always polish in straight lines,
never in circles.

Straight lines.

We're back in the cotton field.

Oh, Nathan, you see your boy?

Who gonna help you now?

a bit all over the place here...

aesthetically speaking.

What do you really think of me?

Oh. That's like a wife asking her husband
if she looks fat.

I'm not going there.
Come on, please tell me.

Okay, you look fat.

You seem to be
on some kind of mission, huh?

Boy, I'd love to know what that is.

Hell-bent on saving every boy
here at the camp.

What with all your speeches
and your prognostications.

Is that a word?
I don't think that's a word.

But, you know, you're on a roll.
So carry on, please.

Open it.

Why open it? I lived it.

All right, then.

Shouldn't be that difficult
refreshing your memory, huh?

Grand theft auto. Vandalism.

Dealing mushrooms
and sampling your own wares.

And you got busted by the police...

at 4 a.m., naked on a corner
in Riverdale, wow.

I don't mean to get technical, sir,
but I was wearing socks.

You think I don't know anything,
do you?

Just like anybody
who's ever tried to tell you anything.

But I'll tell you, I do know one thing.

I know what it's like to lose a father.

When I was 13 years old,
I found out my father had cancer.

And the next two years,
I just watched him wither away.

Brought him home from the hospital so
he could spend the last few days with us.

I remember one morning
I was going to school...

and I heard the TV on
in the living room.

And I thought my father
was just watching The <i>Today Show.</i>

But he wasn't.

He wasn't watching anything.

He was...
He had a plastic bag around his head.

He decided to beat God to the punch.

So, you see,
I do know what it's like to lose a father.

And everything around you
just becomes so stupid.

Your friends, your teachers.

And you know
what really pisses you off?

Is everybody's cockiness.

Thinking that everything
is so important, so dramatic.

Like everything's gonna last forever.

The day we buried them...

I looked across the street
from the cemetery...

and there was this guy
mowing his lawn...

like nothing had happened.

And it made me insane.

Billy, do you know why you're here?

Not because you dealt drugs
or you... Or you stole a car.

Please don't.

Because you need
to learn a lesson, Billy.

You need to learn that
no one gets away with anything.

Not with all your jokes,
and all your charm and all your talk.

You know, that's just bullshit.

BOY:
Whoo!

OLLIE: Hey.
Hi.

You're Billy's sister, yeah?
Yeah.

Have you seen him around?
BILLY: Mm-hm.

OLLIE: Speak of the devil.
Ollie.

Come on, man. I told you, not here.

I'm sorry, man, I forgot what you said.
That's cool, man.

Why don't you go see Dad?

<i>MONTGOMERY: You've been
begging us to beat you for it.</i>

<i>But I'm not gonna do that, Billy.</i>

I'm not. I'm gonna teach you
how to live with it. By admitting it.

â™ªâ™ª

<i>You were at the wheel.</i>

And if you hadn't been wasting time
with your dealer...

y'all would've made it.


Oh, don't, no. Oh, I love, yes.

Oh, come on.

<i>â™ª Or hang around for you' â™ª</i>

Let me give you
a little father-son, Billy.

You're driving in your car...

you turn on the radio.
Your girl's riding shotgun.

She's got her hand on your knee.

Dad, we got a little girl
in the backseat here.

A song comes on the radio...

the kind of song makes you drive
until it's over...

so you crank it up.

If she says "turn it down"...

dump her at the next corner.

Does Mom ever turn it down?

Not once.

What was that thing
with the kid there?

Dad, it was nothing.

<i>â™ª Sometimes I think â™ª</i>

Doing the right thing
is never nothing, Billy.

<i>AH that's over. From now on,

<i>Not punishment.

Hey, Billy.

Some lemonade would be nice, huh?

Okay, there's nothing
you can do for him.

And don't waste your time with
some heroic fantasies either, all right?

Focus on your own salvation.

Hey, Billy, can you get that?

Hello.

Yes.

Who's calling, please?

Who?

Hey, we have an emergency.

Please hurry.

MONTGOMERY: Mr. Wyatt.
Come out of the car immediately.

BILLY:
Shit!

Mr. Wyatt. Mr. Wyatt,
get out of the car.

Now, if you come out right now,
no one's gonna get hurt.

Mr. Stein's gonna be taken care of.
You understand?

Ain't that some shit?

MONTGOMERY: Come on, Mr. Fuentes.
I want you to back up right now.

I see you, Guillermo.

MONTGOMERY:
Take everybody with you.

CARLOS: You got this place high up
in the Sangre de Cristo mountains.

You can't think of the last line
of your fifth novel.

You got one baby bouncing
on your knee and another on the way.

Your neighbor's playing his horn.
And it's sunset.

All around you,
your world is painted red and gold.

Then it comes to you,
the last line of your novel.

Tomorrow doesn't have to
be yesterday.

What the hell's going on?
Go ahead, handle it.

Just do whatever you have to do,
I don't care.

Just handle it.

â™ªâ™ª

Do it.

Go ahead, do it.

Come on, Conrad.
What the hell you doing?

I'm not shooting a kid.
Where you going?

Come back here, you coward!

Time to go home, Billy.

If you go back to your dorms right now,
nothing will happen to you, understand?

Go, go, go for it. Go.

Come on, come on.
The only way out is through.

Do it, you crazy motherfucker!

MONTGOMERY:
Wyatt, it's your last chance.

[BOYS CHEERING]

Go, Billy!
MONTGOMERY: Come on.

You guys have to get going now.
Come on, get to it.

[SIREN WAILING]

MONTGOMERY:
Get them!

What are you doing? Go get him!
The kid just stole my car!

<i>BILLY:
Don't ask for guarantees.</i>

<i>And don't look to be saved...</i>

<i>in any one thing, person,
machine or library.</i>

<i>Do your own bit of saving.</i>

<i>And if you drown, at least die knowing
you were heading for shore.</i>

I got him. I got it, I got it.
You got it?

BILLY:
Hey.

Hey. Nathan.

Hey. Don't you die, man, okay?

You're the first dude
who could stand me in a long time.

You too, Billy.

<i>Thank you.</i>

TINA:
<i>Billy!</i>

Billy!
EMT 1: Sir, can you step out, please?

Thank you.

Can you hear me? Okay.
No, he's unconscious.

<i>EMT 1:
He's breathing. Can you pull him out?</i>

EMT 2:
Look out for his head. Grab his legs.

BILLY: His sister.
Just please try to find his sister.

Yeah, okay. I'll try.

<i>TINA:
People like us...</i>

<i>we find each other all the time.</i>

<i>BILLY: But that's the wonderful thing
about man.</i>

<i>He never gets so discouraged
or disgusted...</i>

<i>that he gives up
doing it all over again...</i>

<i>that he gives up
doing it all over again...</i>

<i>because he knows very we"
it is important and worth the doing.</i>

[TIRES SCREECH]

[DOORBELL RINGS]

[SIRENS APPROACHING]

Billy? What are you doing?

It's okay, Mom.
Why are you here?

Why are you here?
OFFICER: Billy Wyatt?

Turn around slowly
and put your hands behind your head.

It's okay, Mom.
I just came home to say I'm sorry.

It's gonna be okay.

MRS. WYATT:
I am sorry too. I love you.

BILLY:
I love you too.

MRS. WYATT:
I've waited so long to hear you say that.

[HANDCUFFS CLICKING]

You love me?
Yeah, I love you.

You love me.
