We did not know what was happening. 
 We were away from our house.

I took the suitcases involved

It was my old violin.

There was a speeldoos in

 There are only new buildings.

New buildings, but your father

 included.

I have now to college.

Come, Simcha. Let's go hiking.

Thank you.

Outside service.

Wait here, then I'll get you so.

You have it easy, Atilla. 
 Your legs z jn still good.

I have some pain. The blood flows 
 right to my feet.

That said the doctor himself.

Yes, he can easily talk.

Doctors, they sit all day on their 
 hole and still get well paid too.

But I do not.

From early morning until late at night 
 by the leg. And for what?

For a bunch of Jews.

And how long will that Jews ongoing

They think that all of them. 
 - I must just like the children. alleen even de kinderen halen.

Did they against me 
 or monsieur le concierge?

Can I use the pram here

That sounds all politely. 
 Do you not, Atilla?

Schoft.

Did you have something?

No, that was the dog. The poor beast 
 krjgt no word between.

This is Chaja, the new kindermeisje.

He may hand you do not give 
 according to the thora.

A man may only his own wife 
 touch.

I do not want that woman in my house.

You had to wait on me. 
 She is a poor woman.

I need help, Leibl. 
 I can not do it alone.

Why not someone from our faith? 
 - That there is not.

She is there practically naked.

She is good with the children.

She is no better than a gomer.

Papa called her a gomer.

He has returned to his pants geplast.

In school, you do.

Will we go buy bread? 
 For the ducks.

These are ducks.

Can you say that?

You know what the duck say?

They say kwak-kwak. 
 Can you say that?

I think you understand everything I say.

Like your new job a little bit?

You will pay no more pants, I see.

What does gomer?

In the Bible is a gomer 
 a sinful woman. Why?

Great. He called me a whore.

Who? 
 - Mr. Kalman.

For him, every woman in miniskirt that.

Can I just proposals? 
 I'm Yakov Apfelschnitt.

I'm an old friend of Chaja.

And how hot you?

He is four and he still does not talk.

Maybe he has nothing important 
 saying.

But a child should talk 
 by that age.

Rabbi Sem Malov, who is a genius 
 called ...

... spoke no word on his eighteenth.

But when he began to talk, 
 he knew the whole Bible from his head.

Simcha not do. 
 Soon you fall in the water.

In Selma, on the occasion 
 from her birthday.

Nice blouse, dearest. He'll be.

But you should really let your hair.

How do you find my hairstyle? 
 Yesterday get things done.

A new hairdresser. By Mrs 
 Goldblum. Try him again.

Maybe I do that.

They would have been 48 today.

It was her own decision.

She was so beautiful. And a good pianist.

An alcoholic, she was. 
 - After they returned.

Can we now eat our soup?

Hot chocolate. They did 
 the poison in hot chocolate.

What did they have to do? 
 Kippensoep?

They have five children.

One of them has red hair. Simcha.

He is such a baby, you would have him 
. With those funny slaaplokken.

Ready?

Why now?

Why on her birthday? 
 - Let the past rest anyway.

Do you want to bury the past 
 under a pile of cake?

Are you forgetting? They left you 
 seem to accumulate in Auschwitz.

Does. And you want to forget.

Forgotten. I would not talk about it, 
 and that you know.

A man is what he is 
 and not what he was 30 years ago.

Yes, but Selma is dead. She has so many 
 ago and you have no compassion.

And why? Because they are always there but 
 is talking about. Ever again.

Scream not. And your family? 
 Your father, your mother.

You never talk about. 
 Is this normal? Is this normal?

Is it normal to two old 
 suitcases to dig?

You with your cards and your books.

And but walk. The whole city, 
 as a crazy.

Rather an insane 
 like you do.

You make flight path. 
 You pretend nothing happened.

I'm open.

You think that leaving the 
 because you do not want to think.

caketrommel I get back. 
 Then I can at least the door.

AIs I have a little time on stamps 
 hear, I killed him.

Chaja, look're still agree. 
 What a beautiful blouse.

You look beautiful. 
 Such a fine, warm family.

Keep the doors. 
 I am them to the polishing.

dirty Jews. They live in filth.

Mumps you that there is not even much more 
 about.

Good attention at school, boys.

Leibl, put some money down for Chaja. 
 It's payday.

Be nice to Mom.

Wait for me.

You can not. The floor is wet.

Alstubieft, the children are tired.

You hear that, Atilla? They are tired.

They are the whole afternoon in the park 
 and now they are tired.

And now they come with their dirty 
 pram by my clean swing.

What can we care? We let ourselves 
 not offend by that horror.

What did you say?

Oh, dear.

Will we see the trains go?

Look, we can take a picture. 
 Or is that also forbidden?

OK, we'll make a picture of your 
 as duck.

Look, duckling.

It is almost seven hours. 
 You would come back for four hours.

DThe concierge did not let us. Now snap 
 why I have moved the others.

Do not pay attention to him. Seven hours, 
 what a time to come home.

We know what we are against him 
 to say, hey Simcha.

Say something. 
 - They are hungry.

Mrs. Kalman, something he has said. 
 Go on, Simcha.

Help me out. Open the door.

He said "quack." Really.

Simcha, say 'quack-quack. "

spying on me?

out of the way, asshole.

Why are you doing this? It is pointless. 
 This is not it?

Yes, you're right. It was not.

I remember the river.

You think I'm an old fool, eh.

You're right, I'm an idiot. 
 I do not know what I got.

I feel cheated.

I think I begin to be old.

In four years he has never said anything 
 and suddenly he says' quack-quack. "

Very wisely, quack-quack What's there 
 more to say about life?

Especially if you are brought up. 
 Chassidim They are idiots.

What do you mean?

Their curls, their kaftan 
 and their stupid ideas.

What did you say to them?

Nothing, but they still live in ghettos 
 from the old Europe.

Hundreds of years of imprisonment 
 and humiliation.

They walk around in prison clothes 
 from that time. Why?

Watch me. I Wear 
 clothes from the prison camp?

The ghetto walls are cases and 
 those pious chassidim build them again.

I gotta go. Simcha wait.

What is that? 
 - A secret.

A gift for me?

Do not leave without saying: 
 I love you.

I love you, Daddy.

I love you. I do love you.

You know what I'm going to do?

I am of that army buy tickets. 
 Many detailed.

I have a gift for you.

Would you open it?

Duck.

Wheel.

Nose.

Lamp.

Simcha.

What is that thing?

He said something.

He speaks, he speaks.

Framework, boiler, table ...

... shoes, duck, quack.

Leibl, guess what. It is a miracle.

The elevator is out of service. 
 I had to climb all those stairs.

This is also caretaker never 
 If you need him.

Wat is dat?

A miracle. Leibl, listen.

Wait, wait.

Let him now. He is fond of. 
 - I do not want such a toy in the house.

You learn nothing.

Simcha can talk, sir Kalman.

It's true. You've heard it yourself.

He has a lot of words. 
 Listen, listen.

Simcha, say something. Say 'duck'.

Duck. Talk, Simcha.

You heard him "quack" say? 
 Kwak-quack.

My son says "quack" while he 
 would have to say his prayers ...

.. and the four questions 
 during the seider.

Duck, wheel ...

Come on, Simcha.

I pee in my pants.

The four questions for the seider 
 I teach them you, it's easy.

Chaja, I can not.

Of course it does, you have another two weeks.

Why should I learn this?

Because you should ask your father 
 to the seider.

And if you're father ...
I am a duck.

Then you duck the first Orthodox 
 with red sofa and a lure Keppel.

What is going on? 
 - We make clean for Pesach.

All breadcrumbs have gone. 
 No yeast with Pesach.

How you doing, honey?

I will not pee in my pants, huh? 
 - No, do not worry.

They should to the kitchen

They need not to the kitchen.

Eight days Pesach.

I would lie on the ground 
 and eight hours sleep.

There must be done so much for tonight.

m And a man I have nothing.

He not only sells chocolate, 
 he thinks chocolate.

Fortunately sold Moses no chocolate.

Then we had the Promised Land 
 never met.

Take your children 
 to the park?

I they can not now have on the floor.

Will I come tonight to help? 
 Or is that also forbidden?

Would you do that? It is not prohibited. 
 Not with Pesach.

What's here?

Get your hand away, then I can read.

There is "quack-quack-quack."

Am I?

What do you think of the new decorations?

Awful.

I see them as primitive schideringen 
 from troglodyte ...

... that too little language 
 for a simple call.

And how are you exercises, 
 Simcha sir?

Excuse me ... I have to tell you. 
 Stinksok is here.

You let no grass grow on.

Do you mind?

No, you can have him.

Are you going out?

Yes, eating.

Do you have a boyfriend?

Good for you.

Are you going to swim tomorrow? 
 Or is it very late tonight?

No, my friend should go to bed early.

And now, Simcha ...

Come on, Simcha.

He can not.

But I do.

Good, Simcha.

Very good, Simcha.

But you made a mistake 
 in the first question.

You said 'matses eat. " It must have 
 'eat only matses. " Tell me.

It is not fair.

Why do so? 
 He has practiced in weeks.

Would you ask her to stop?

No, I take it for your son. 
 It is not fair to him.

Send her away.

No, I am not going away.

Then I go.

Chaja not do.

Leave this room immediately. 
 - No.

How can you treat as your son?

These are the rules. And under my roof 
 you respect my rules.

I respect your rules, 
 and your faith.

But your religion has no respect 
 for others.

Why you called me a Gomer? 
 Because I am otherwise? Me dressed differently?

Leave this room. Now.

I understand you do not. Dares you not 
 to keep your son?

These are my late father 
 and my little brother.

They were my eyes hung 
 in the camp.

We should all watch.

You know why they were 
 hanged?

Because they refused the refugee problem 
 to spit and curse God.

And you dare me to say 
 I have no respect?

My god ...

He seems to Simcha.

Excuse me.

Please ...

Go now.

Excuse me.

Please ...

How Stinksok?

Boring.

And your new friend? Are you in love?

Is he cute?

How old is he? 
 - Four.

Four?

He has red hair. He is so sweet 
 with its small slaaplokjes.

Slaaplokjes?

They are chassidisch 
 - Oh, those guys. Creep.

What do you mean, 'freak'?

Well, with those weird clothes from them.

That's just their pregnancy.

I had my mother not 
 play with Jews.

O no?

Are they not very 
 goj that you are?

I'm not goj. 
 - O no?

I'm Jewish 
 - You look out not Jewish.

Is that a compliment?

Excuse me. But you got me 
 never told.

Your father has still not that lure.

The Jews are talking to itself 
 to thank. They do not adjust to.

Fit? Or they adapt 
 or not, they were killed anyway.

You know what I mean. 
 - No.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Are you still mad at Dad?

And Dad on you?

Are you with us? 
 - Sure, honey.

Well, I will you finally learn 
 the liftdeur close to doing.

Chaja, my hand.

Simcha racing.

You've torn my uniform. 
 - Racing.

Jewish pig. What do you do?

This is not my job. 
 - Is children sometimes hurt your work?

You've torn my uniform. 
 You have to pay.

You have to pay me.

Mrs. Kalman.

You never believe it. 
 - What is it?

He wanted to hurt my hand. 
 - Who?

He wanted to hurt my hand. 
 - Who?

The concierge. He is a fascist.

Does it hurt? 
 - No.

He was able to break him. 
 He threw the liftdeur so close.

He is common. 
 - He always cries.

You can not let go of your hand.

My husband talk with him later 
 He is afraid of my husband.

But we can make him angry. 
 - Why not? That Bastard.

He comes to children and called us 
 dirty Jews.

Swearing does not hurt. 
 - You must fight back.

No, let's drink tea.

But it is wrong.

Is his coat really broken?

Yes, and I pay him. 
 I still prefer to go dead.

We can not rejoice 
 about the fall of our enemy.

But there is nothing that we have him 
 up to help.

Thank you for what you've done.

This uniform must be paid. 
 The franc is your 1500 costs.

You have already to another?

Sure. I got two. 
 One in the laundry.

Well, then I go to the landlord 
 in Brussels.

Well, then I go to the landlord 
 in Brussels.

Chaja, I would not be bothered. 
 - That krjgt But you do.

The landlord is already looking for an excuse 
 to all of you on the street to throw.

Tell him I've torn your coat 
 because you are one of the tenants attacked.

It was a joke. 
 - Just kidding? His hand was almost broken.

He does nothing wrong. And I?

You have my uniform in rags 
 torn and you'll pay for it.

I have people behind me. 
 An entire organization.

Chaja, we pay it.

No, that will not hog cent.

None cent.

Do you take orders from your staff? 
 - Give me a break.

One more word about that stupid 
 uniform ...

One more word about that stupid 
 uniform ...

What did you say? Open up.

I demand respect.

Get sorry.

I got a uniform for my work.

How else they know who I am?

I can not do my work 
 without uniform.

Ik kan m'n werk niet doen
zonder uniform.

None cent.

Day.

You can not.

I'm doing the cleaning.

You can sleep here. 
 - I go home when I want.

Ik vraag geen toestemming
aan die vuile fascist.

I ask no permission 
 to that dirty fascist.

Why not? I will not let me lock.

And the kids? 
 You give them a bad example.

Maybe it's a good example. 
 - Off 'window climbing and break your neck?

No, stand up for yourself.

I think they are right. 
 - Me too.

Come off.

Do not. It is dangerous. 
 What are you still stubborn.

The Bible is full of strong women. 
 Good afternoon, everybody.

Chaja, please do not break your neck.

Nope.

May the Almighty protect her.

I did it.

Excuse me, sir. Jews also live here?

If you see someone that another

 to stop.

If necessary by force.

The concierge is still blazing. 
 About a week he calmed down.

The concierge is still blazing. 
 About a week he calmed down.

We pay your course. 
 And next week you can begin again.

You would not leave his chest?

It is better for a week 
 truce to hold.

It is no truce 
 but a capitulation.

Simcha, come on.

Go to your mother.

And who then execute the ducks? 
 - That is what other people do.

How long is a week? 
 - A little night sleep.

Maybe they are back.

You need at least a nice new wallpaper.

Hello. There's visit.

These are my wife and my daughter.

Good afternoon.

Your husband was a pit at the graves 
 on private land.

He said he was looking for two pieces of baggage. 
 Two suitcases from the war, is not it?

We will not do more, huh. 
 Otherwise, we must take action.

Antwerp is not a sandpit.

If everybody just goes graves, 
 there is just nothing left.

We have to take your shovel.

Is that real?

Yes, the agents can scoop 
 better take.

Thank you for giving my husband 
 home has brought.

Goodbye, sir.

Do you want a slice of cake? 
 - No, thank you

Let me give you a piece for the road. 
 Just one.

Do you know what John F. Kennedy actually 
 said when he said: LCH bin ein Berliner?

Yes, I know.

I am a donut. 
 Ein Berliner is a donut.

he had to say: LCH bin Berliner.

But he told 
 the whole world: --

I am a donut.

Oh, my boy. My poor son.

I do not know what to do.

Take a bath, pull clean clothes on ...

... drinking a cup of coffee and I give you 
 a delicious slice of cake.

That is not to say.

I do not know what I should 
 with my life.

Tomorrow you go chess.

And I go back weaving. 
 As we have always done.

Sir Apfelschnitt.

I get a glass of water for u.

I just wanted to go Kalman. 
 The truce is over.

An old uncle of mine taught me 
 to never bring bad news ...

... without a bit of good news.

The good news is that your father 
 weather is going chess.

He sent me four times reports.

The bad news is 
 that Simcha Kalman dead.

Did you hear me?

Did you hear me?

He drowned in the pond 
 in the park.

Friday.

His mother picked him ...

... but he was gone.

And yesterday, on the Sabbath, 
 they found him in the pond.

When I was on my bench in the park Saturday ...

...came two firemen 
 in diving suits to the pond.

When I heard who they were looking for ...

... I stayed.

There is a whole crowd gathered, 
 mainly gojim.

They have a nose for trouble.

His father was there all morning 
 been with a few chassidim.

Even the rabbi was there.

Friday was Mrs Kalman ...

him search in the park.

And she took his toy in the water.

duckling on wheels.

His father stood in the pond 
 and held the toy in his hands .

... as if the child so he could retrieve it.

Why did you come?

Have you no decency? 
 No respect for the dead?

Nobody wants to accuse you, 
 but you're not really welcome here.

accuse Me?

Simcha You took it every day 
 to that pond?

child, barely four years old, 
 that could not even swim.

True or not?

Simcha You took it, 
 he so alienated from his parents.

How could you do that?

Speak not. We must look 
 for the will of the Almighty.

You can better go now.

No

Many daughters of Israel have 
 been brave ...

... but you have surpassed them all.

You still get money from me.

It is a pity the little boy.

I wished him no harm again.

I just wanted him to learn a lesson 
 the liftdeur. It was the principle.

This work is not easy, you know.

went past it, but my legs 
 do the very last time around.

The blood flows to my feet. 
 It said the doctor himself.

You're just as guilty as the water, 
 the trees or the ducks in the pond.

Those were his accomplices to death.

The water because it did nothing else 
 than embrace him.

Trees unemployed because they were watching.

And the ducks because he was lured 
 by their croak.

And you, Chaja ...

You did all you could do.

You loved Simcha Kalman.

This is wrong.

I'm sure, 
 it is totally wrong.

This is not the right place. 
 - It is not wrong.

You have not read the map.

I read all cards before 
 you were born.

Look, this is the right place. 
 It must.

Here was the house ...

And when we arrived ...

From the right, and when we turned around. 
 - No, we came from this side.

When we went to the right. 
 - Yes, but then left.

We never find them. 
 - We find them.

All we need very Antwerp 
 spade.

Please, Chaja ...
on, dig.
