<i>A billionaire playboy...</i>

(Sara screams)
<i>Lost at sea.</i>


<i>Compelled by his father's</i>
<i>dying confession...</i>

I didn't build our city.
I failed it.

No!

<i>Oliver Queen made a promise</i>

<i>to one day right</i>
<i>his father's wrongs.</i>

(Robert's voice) This is
your responsibility now.

My responsibility?

<i>But first...</i>

Aah! Aah!

<i>He had to survive...</i>

You want survive? You kill.

To forge himself into a weapon.

<i>Five years later...</i>

<i>He returned home...</i>


<i>But not as Oliver Queen.</i>

<i>As something else.</i>

What happened to you
on that island?

How did you survive this?

<i>He punished the wicked</i>
<i>and corrupt...</i>

What do you want? Aah!

<i>Delivering justice</i>
<i>outside the law.</i>

I do what's necessary.

(Brakes screech)

You're no hero.
You're a killer.

<i>His allies were few.</i>

There's more than one way
to save this city.

I'm gonna help you?

<i>His enemies many.</i>

Who needs two bullets
in the chest?

Are you ready to die?

<i>It soon became clear</i>

<i>that the</i> real <i>threat</i>
<i>to Starling City...</i>

Oh, my God.

<i>Was far more deadly</i>
<i>than he had ever imagined.</i>

In six months,

the organization's vision
will be complete.

And it would take everything...

You might just
have a chance.

<i>He learned.</i>

No, you can't!

Why should I trust you?!

You should make up
your mind.

You have failed this city.

Oliver Queen is alive.

The Starling City resident
was found by fishermen

in the North China Sea.

(Reporters shouting at once)

Queen is the son

of Starling City billionaire
Robert Queen,

who was also onboard

but now officially confirmed
as deceased.

When Oliver Queen returned home
<i>to Starling City,</i>

<i>he was not</i>
<i>the same spoiled rich kid</i>

<i>who had disappeared at sea.</i>

The Oliver you lost might not be
the one they found.

<i>The lavish life</i>
<i>he had once taken for granted</i>

<i>now seemed foreign.</i>

what else did you miss?

Super Bowl winners--giants,
Steelers, Saints, Packers.

A black president--that's new.

What was it like there?

(Water lapping)

Cold.

<i>Everything around him</i>
<i>had changed,</i>

<i>beginning with his mother.</i>

Walter and I are married.

And I don't want you to think
that either one of us

did anything
to disrespect your father.

<i>His sister Thea</i>
<i>had grown up fast.</i>

Where did you get these?

Thank you,
daddy's A.C.L. tear.

Ollie!

No one's called me that
in a while, Speedy.

Worst nickname ever.

<i>Thea had been managing</i>
<i>her grief</i>

<i>in less than healthy ways.</i>

My brother and my father
died.

I went to your funeral.

You can't come back here
and judge me,

especially for being
just like you.

<i>This</i> me--the best I could do
with what I had to work with.

So what'd you miss the most?

Steaks at the Palm?
Drinks at the Station?

Meaningless sex?

Laurel.

Everyone is happy
you're alive.

You wanna see the one person
who isn't?

Hello, Laurel.

Hunt has an army of lawyers,
and they are ready to bury us.

You and I against many.
I love those odds.

Why do you hate me?

<i>Oliver's ex-girlfriend</i>
<i>Laurel Lance</i>

<i>had become an attorney,</i>

<i>going after Starling City's</i>
<i>corrupt and powerful.</i>

<i>Laurel was tough.</i>

Why are you here, Ollie?
<i>She had to be...</i>

To apologize.

<i>After what Oliver had done.</i>

I never meant--
she was my sister.

(Sara screaming)

Sara!
Aah!

Sara!

I couldn't grieve
because I was so angry.

That's what happens

when your sister dies
while screwing your boyfriend.

It should've been you.

I'd hoped that
you'd rot in hell

a whole lot longer
than five years.

No! No! Help!
Dad, she's out there!

She's not there!
She's gone.

<i>Laurel wasn't the only one</i>
<i>who was angry.</i>

Did you even try to save her?

Did you even try to save
my daughter?

Okay, let's go, partner.

Fine.

<i>Her father,</i>
<i>Detective Quentin Lance,</i>

<i>never recovered from the loss</i>
<i>of his daughter Sara.</i>

Let's go.
(Clears throat)

<i>He wasn't ready to forgive,</i>

<i>but Oliver was much better</i>
<i>at letting go.</i>

How much do you know about your
own so-called friends over here?

<i>His best friend</i>
<i>and former girlfriend</i>

<i>had grown close.</i>

Well, I guess
they never told you

that they've been screwing
while you were gone.

Look, man, I--

Tommy...

It's okay.

<i>Oliver's homecoming attracted</i>
<i>all types of attention...</i>

What the hell?!

<i>Including the wrong kind.</i>


Mr. Queen!

(Taser crackles)

Did he make it to the island?

Did he tell you anything?

Uhh! Aah!

(Robert grunts)

I'm not the man
you think I am.

I didn't build our city.

I failed it.


Did you father survive
that accident?

(Exhales deeply)
<i>You can survive this.</i>

Make it home.
Make it better.

Right my wrongs.

But you gotta
live through this first.

Survive.

No!

What did he tell you,
Mr. Queen?

He told me
I'm gonna kill you.

<i>Oliver's time on the island</i>
<i>changed him,</i>

<i>and his assailants</i>

<i>were the first to find out</i>
<i>just how much.</i>

But he couldn't allow anyone to
<i>know what he was capable of.</i>

Nobody can know my secret.

(Bones crunch)
Aah!


<i>Robert Queen had left his son</i>
<i>with a list of names--</i>

<i>people who had done wrong</i>
<i>by Starling City.</i>

<i>It was his dying wish</i>

that Oliver would make them pay
<i>for their crimes.</i>

<i>Five years on the island</i>
<i>of Lian Yu</i>

<i>had prepared him mentally</i>

<i>and physically.</i>

<i>It would his mission</i>
<i>to rid his city, one by one,</i>

<i>of those who were using</i>
<i>their powers to destroy it.</i>

You remind Grell, I put him on
the bench, I can take him off.

I will turn him into
a cautionary tale.

Yes, Mr. Hunt.

And this attorney--

(electricity crackles)

Uhh!
Get in the car!

<i>Oliver wouldn't be able to</i>
<i>carry out this justice</i>

<i>as himself.</i>

<i>He needed to live</i>
<i>in the shadows.</i>

<i>He would have to become</i>
<i>someone else...</i>

<i>something else.</i>

You're gonna transfer
$40 million

by 10:00 p.m. tomorrow night.

Or what?

Or I'm gonna take it,
and you won't like how.

(Slaps hand)
He was wearing a hood.

A green hood.

And he had a bow and arrow.

We'll put out
an A.P.B. on...

Robin Hood.

He said he would be back here
by 10:00 p.m.

Make sure you're here first.

He's never gonna get in.

(Electricity powers down)

(Elevator bell dings)

Uhh! Uhh!

You missed.
Really?

(Metal clanks)

(Helicopter whirring overhead)

Tell me you saw that.

Untraceable?!

It is $40 million!

Find it!

(Exhales deeply)

How did he do it?

<i>His war on Starling City's</i>
<i>cancerous criminal elite</i>

<i>had begun.</i>

<i>But Oliver never imagined</i>
<i>the extent of the disease...</i>

<i>or just how far it had spread.</i>

My son knows nothing.

You know, Robert didn't tell him
anything that could hurt us.

And he has no idea that
the yacht was sabotaged.

Where'd he come from?

Working from his father's list,

Oliver Queen systematically took down

<i>the worst of Starling City's</i>
<i>corrupt and powerful...</i>

Please! No, please!
Marcus Redmond,

you failed this city.

Please don't! Please don't!

<i>Administering brutal justice.</i>

Aah! Aah!

You're gonna testify
in that trial.

You're gonna confess to having
Victor Nocenti killed.

Please, no! Aah!

<i>No one knew</i>
<i>who the vigilante was,</i>

<i>but his exploits</i>
<i>quickly became notorious.</i>

This guy gets more airtime
than the Kardashians.

This city used to be different.
People used to feel safe.

Afraid we're gonna be next?

(Siren wailing)

<i>He gained the attention</i>
<i>of the law...</i>

Freeze!

Bow down, hands up.


<i>And earn notice from enemies</i>
<i>he didn't yet know existed.</i>

A modern day Robin Hood.

Jason Brodeur.

Adam Hunt.

Warren Patel.

Tell me you see a connection,
Moira.

He's not targeting the rich.

No, he's not.

He's targeting the list.

<i>Secrets and lies were critical</i>
<i>to survival,</i>

<i>so to the public,</i>

<i>he was the rich playboy</i>
<i>he had always been.</i>

I miss Tequila!


<i>To the Russian</i> Bratva,

<i>he was a captain.</i>

<i>And after earning</i>
<i>their trust...</i>

Pleased to meet you.

<i>They provided</i>
<i>valuable information</i>

about the criminal underground.

<i>But to Oliver's family,</i>
<i>he was a ghost.</i>

I felt closer to you
when you were dead.

Look, I know it was hell
where you were,

but it was hell here, too.

You gotta let me in, Ollie.

You gotta let <i>someone</i> in.


I wanna introduce you
to someone.



<i>To his new bodyguard</i>
<i>John Diggle...</i>

So...

<i>Oliver would be an extremely</i>
<i>difficult assignment.</i>

You're ex-military?
Yes, sir.

105th Airborne
out of Kandahar. Retired.

I don't want there to be
any confusion, Mr. Queen.

My ability to keep you from harm
will outweigh your comfort.

(Car door opens and closes)

(Car horns honk,
tires screech)

<i>Years before,</i>
<i>Diggle's brother was murdered</i>

<i>by a vicious assassin</i>
<i>called Deadshot,</i>

<i>who had recently returned</i>
<i>to Starling City.</i>


Aah!
(Woman screams)

<i>Oliver faced off</i>
<i>with the killer...</i>

Uhh!

<i>And took him out,</i>

<i>but not before</i>

<i>one of Deadshot's</i>
<i>signature poison-laced bullets</i>

<i>ended up in Diggle.</i>

<i>After saving</i>
<i>his bodyguard's life,</i>

<i>Oliver decided it was time</i>
<i>to let him in on his secret.</i>

You're that vigilante.

Starling City is dying.

It is being poisoned
by a criminal elite

who don't care
who they hurt.

And what are you gonna do?

Take 'em all down
by your lonesome?

No, I want you to join me.

Here's the security footage

from the Exchange building
shooting.

<i>While investigating</i>
<i>the Deadshot incident,</i>

<i>Detective Lance made</i>
<i>a shocking discovery.</i>

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

Wait, go back 10 seconds.
What is that?

(Taps button)
I'll be damned.

What the hell is going on?!

Oliver Queen, you're under arrest

on suspicion
of obstruction of justice,

aggravated assault...
What?!

Acting as a vigilante,
and murder.

Who's your attorney,
Mr. Queen?

<i>The accusation made for</i>
<i>an unlikely alliance...</i>

Dinah Laurel Lance, Your Honor.

<i>And drove a wedge</i>
<i>between father and daughter.</i>

You hate the hood
and you hate Oliver,

and you want more than anything
for them to be the same person.

<i>Oliver managed</i>
<i>to beat a polygraph.</i>

Are you the man in this picture?
No.

<i>The truth he</i> did <i>tell...</i>

I didn't want to talk about what
happened to me on the island

because the people that were
there tortured me.

<i>Had an effect on Laurel.</i>


How did you survive this?

There were times
when I wanted to die.


In the end, there was something
I wanted more.

You don't--
Laurel, you don't have to go.

<i>House arrest provided Oliver</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

<i>to prove he wasn't the Hood,</i>

<i>with a little help...</i>

<i>From Diggle</i>

<i>as the vigilante.</i>

An arms dealer was attacked
across town tonight

by the vigilante.
In light of that,

all charges against your son
are being dropped.

Thank you.

<i>Once he was free,</i>

<i>Oliver and Diggle went</i>
<i>back to work.</i>

Ow! Uhh!

Variable acceleration.

Fighters work
at the same pace.

You switch it up, throw your
opponent off his game.

That was nice.
Where'd you learn that?

His name was Yao Fei.


<i>After the shipwreck,</i>

<i>Oliver landed</i>
<i>on the island of Lian Yu.</i>

<i>He soon discovered...</i>

Aah! Aah!

<i>He was not alone.</i>

<i>First he met Yao Fei...</i>

(Speaks indistinctly)

<i>Ex-Chinese military</i>

<i>exiled to the island</i>
<i>for a crime he didn't commit.</i>

<i>Also on the island?</i>

Do you know what
this island is named?

Lian Yu.

Mandarin for "Purgatory""

<i>a mysterious militia</i>
<i>with bad intentions.</i>

Aah!

<i>After Yao rescued Oliver...</i>

<i>He sent him to meet</i>
<i>another ally.</i>

your throat.

(Strained voice)
Yao Fei sent me here,

and I'm pretty sure it wasn't
so you could kill me.

<i>Slade Wilson was Australian</i>
<i>secret intelligence service,</i>

<i>stranded on the island</i>
<i>after a failed operation</i>

<i>to extricate Yao Fei.</i>

Everybody is in this life
for themselves.

Learn that
at Australian spy school?

No. I learned that here.

<i>He taught Oliver that to</i>
<i>survive and escape the island,</i>

<i>he would have to fight.</i>

You have no skill,

no strength,

no training.

I told you,
I'm not a soldier.

Aah!

Aah!


There might be a fighter
inside of you after all.

You know, one of these days,
you're gonna be straight with me

about what really happened
on that island.

Absolutely.

Aah!
Aah!

But not today.

<i>Diggle was the only one</i>

<i>who knew the truth</i>
<i>about Oliver's double life,</i>

<i>but there was another</i>
<i>who Oliver turned to regularly.</i>

Felicity Smoak?

<i>Felicity Smoak--</i>

<i>Queen Consolidated's</i>
<i>I.T. superstar.</i>

I was at my coffee shop
surfing the web,

and I spilled a latte on it.

These look like bullet holes.

My coffee shop is
in a bad neighborhood.

So a friend of mine is running
a scavenger hunt.

I first need to get
through this.

This is a military-grade
cryptographic security protocol.

My buddy Kevin is starting
an energy drink company.

Could you please do
a spectral analysis?

If it's an energy drink,

why is it in a syringe?

I ran out of sports bottles.

<i>Felicity was also a resource</i>

<i>for Oliver's stepfather</i>
<i>Walter Steele.</i>

I was hoping you could
look into something for me.

Discreetly.

I'm your girl.

<i>When Walter found a mysterious</i>
<i>diary in his wife's possession,</i>

<i>Felicity helped him decode it.</i>

<i>It was information</i>
<i>too dangerous to hold.</i>


I think we're past the point
of conversation, Moira,

which means something
must be done about it.

Mr. Malcolm Merlyn.

<i>Malcolm Merlyn was a titan</i>
<i>of Starling City industry.</i>

<i>He was also Tommy's father.</i>

My wife would've liked you,
Laurel.

Their relationship was complex.

Well, I wish I would've
known her.

She passed away before
Tommy and I became friends.

She was killed, Laurel.

There's no need
to be polite about it.

<i>Merlyn was also</i>
<i>a man with secrets...</i>

<i>Secrets he would do anything</i>
<i>to protect.</i>



And he won't be harmed?

Nor will he ever discover your
involvement. You have my word.

What's done is done.

No, Moira.

It's just beginning.

(Man, modulated voice)
We must send a message.

(Arrows whoosh)

<i>When the dark archer</i>
<i>first appeared,</i>

<i>it seemed he was just</i>
<i>an imitator</i>

<i>in a different color hood.</i>

<i>But when he drew Oliver</i>
<i>into a fight,</i>

<i>his purpose was</i>
<i>curiously specific.</i>

I know about the list,

and the man who authored it
wants you dead!

Aah!

Uhh! Aah! Uhh!

Oliver knew he was dealing with
<i>somebody more than a copycat.</i>

The other archer told me that
somebody compiled the list.

I always assumed
it was my father.

I think there's someone else
out there,

someone who's more of a danger
than the archer.

And I am gonna take him down.

<i>While Oliver was focused</i>
<i>solely on the list...</i>

Leo Mueller,
you have failed this city.

<i>Others expected more of him.</i>

Maybe you can
make a difference

if you think beyond the scope
of those pages.

I'm sure your father
wouldn't mind.

No, you don't get it.

My father died
so that I could live.

Every name that I cross off
this list honors that sacrifice.

Oliver, there's more than
one way to save this city.

Not for me.

It sounds like you have a narrow
definition of being a hero.

I'm not a hero.

<i>Hero or not,</i>

<i>more of his missions took him</i>
<i>outside of the list.</i>

Aah!

<i>He took down drug dealers...</i>

Enjoy
the fruits of your labor.


<i>Psychopathic murderers...</i>

<i>A family of thieves.</i>

Drop your weapons!
I got this!

No! Uhh!

<i>And at times,</i>
<i>he showed compassion</i>

<i>towards those driven to crime</i>
<i>by the city his father failed.</i>

It wasn't his fault.

(Breathes heavily)
I turned my son into this.

If your dad could've
seen you this week,

the way you cared about
the people he had hurt,

the way you stepped up
to try to help them...

I'd say he'd be
pretty damn honored.

I can't imagine

you want the death
of an innocent young woman

on your hands,
not with your principles.

Aah!

(Yao Fei) No!
Hey!

Uhh!

<i>Shado was Yao Fei's daughter,</i>

<i>brought from mainland China</i>
<i>to Lian Yu</i>

to use as leverage against Yao.

No.

<i>It soon became apparent that</i>
<i>Shado was not an ideal captive.</i>

Let the girl go.

No!

<i>And she proved she was</i>
<i>her father's daughter.</i>

Shado, along with Slade Wilson,

<i>trained Oliver to fight.</i>

<i>She coached him in skills</i>

<i>she had learned</i>
<i>from her father.</i>

Showoff.

on the jet's heat trail.

on my mark.

<i>When the island militia</i>

<i>attempted to down</i>
<i>a commercial airliner...</i>

We need to reprogram
the missile.

<i>Oliver and his allies...</i>

(Missile whistling)

Let her go.

<i>And when tested,</i>

<i>Oliver put everything he had</i>
<i>learned from Slade and Shado</i>

<i>into practice.</i>

Uhh!

I got your message.

Is there a reason we can't
do this face-to-face?

<i>Oliver, as the vigilante,</i>

<i>began covertly helping</i>
<i>Laurel Lance</i>

<i>to defend people</i>
<i>the law couldn't protect.</i>

What's in here?

Leverage. Enough to help save
Peter Declan's life.

As an attorney, I never would've
gotten a file like this.

I always thought the law was
sacred. You fixed everything.

Now what do you think?

I think there's
too many people in this city

who only care about
themselves.

They need someone like you.

<i>Her connection to the Hood</i>

<i>complicated</i>
<i>Laurel's relationships</i>

<i>with her father...</i>

He's a damn criminal,
and you've worked with him.

That makes you an accessory.

I am trying to save
an innocent man's life.

No.

You're breaking the law.

<i>And her boyfriend.</i>

So you met up with
the hood guy? Knowingly?

Laurel, he's a murderer.

You sound like my father.

Well, I hate to break it to you,
but he's right.

She's been working with
the hood guy.

And there's some sort of
infatuation thing going on here.

I--
fix this.

Before it becomes something
that's unfixable.

<i>Oliver had trouble</i>
<i>being honest,</i>

<i>but that didn't</i>
<i>stop Felicity...</i>

Hi.
Hi.

<i>From coming to him for help.</i>

Can I trust you?

You've dropped some
fairly ridiculous lies on me,

and...

Yet I still feel like
I can trust you.

You can trust me.

Then I have something
to show you.

Where'd you get it?

From your stepfather.

He said it belongs
to your mother.

This is
your father's notebook.

He kept a list of all the people
in Starling City

who owed him favors.

I've been researching some of
those names online,

and, uh,
they're not good people.

The only way
to keep this family safe

is for everyone in it
to stop asking questions,

including you, Oliver.

<i>But there were still</i>
<i>too many questions left to ask.</i>

I made it clear to him
persuasively

that his plans endanger
the undertaking.

I didn't have to make
the usual threats.


<i>Oliver was concerned</i>
<i>about his mother...</i>

What's the Undertaking?

I don't know.

But with all this talk
about threats, it can't be good.

<i>And determined to find out</i>
<i>everything she knew.</i>

What are you gonna do?


Moira Queen,

you have failed this city.

Please don't kill me.

Do you know anything
about the Undertaking?

I am a mother.

Please don't take me
from my children.

<i>Oliver couldn't help</i>
<i>but show his mother mercy.</i>

I'm not gonna hurt you.

<i>He should've known better.</i>

(Siren wailing in distance)

<i>After he escaped...</i>
(Car alarm chirps)

<i>He went to the one person</i>
<i>at Queen Consolidated</i>

<i>he could trust.</i>
Whoa!

(Strained voice) I'm not gonna
hurt you, Felicity.

How do you know my name?
Because you know my name.

Everything about you just became
so unbelievably clear.


<i>The Starling City Vigilante</i>
<i>attacked Mrs. Queen...</i>


Can you help me?
He's... really heavy.

taken him to a hospital.

Felicity, listen. Trust me.
He'll be fine.

He's been through a lot worse
than this.

<i>Once Oliver was stable,</i>

<i>Diggle and Felicity</i>
<i>addressed the obvious.</i>

I was thinking all this
would be more of a shock.

Oliver brought me a laptop
riddled with bullet holes,

had me trace the black arrow,

and research a company involved
in armored car heists.

I maybe blonde,
but I'm not <i>that</i> blonde.

(Monitor beeping steadily)

I guess I didn't die. Again.

Cool.

<i>Felicity was officially</i>
<i>part of the team.</i>

<i>The Glades is a notoriously</i>
<i>rough side of Starling City...</i>

Hey!

<i>Known as a breeding ground</i>
<i>for all manner of criminal.</i>



His name is Roy Harper.

(Knocks on door)

where I lived?

A little thing called
the Internet.

<i>Thea Queen was not</i>
<i>a cooperative victim.</i>

You know, you showed
some real sac coming down here,

the Glades in the middle
of the night...

You must not know the value
of a vintage purse.

Hey, can I give you
some advice?

Stay out of the Glades.

<i>As it turns out,</i>
<i>Roy's advice was sound.</i>

Where's downtown at?

I-I-I don't know.

Maybe you can give us
some directions.

Or better yet, some money.


You're bleeding!
Yeah, I know.

That's what happens
when you get stabbed.

This could sting a little.

Oh, don't tell me
a tough gangbanger like yourself

is afraid of
a tiny little needle.

Well, just think about
something else.

Like what? (Inhales sharply)

<i>Thea was charmed</i>
<i>by Roy's bravery...</i>

I was waiting for this.

Waiting for what?

<i>But not by his life</i>
<i>as a petty crook.</i>

This is home, sweet home
for me.

You either starve
or you do things

that mean you're lucky enough
to make it to 21.

Yeah?

Uhh!
Roy!

<i>A deranged vigilante</i>
<i>called the Savior</i>

<i>looked to make an example</i>
<i>of Roy.</i>

More on the story
out of the Glades.

The kidnapper seems to have
another victim.

You know him?
Uh, Roy. He's my friend. (Sniffles)

I promise you
he's gonna be okay.

Felicity, show me a map...
(Taps key)

Of sites of the abductions

and where we've seen the signal
so far. (Typing)

<i>Diggle and Felicity traced</i>
<i>Savior's location</i>

<i>to Starling City's</i>
<i>abandoned subway.</i>

Don't do it!

<i>After Oliver rescued him,</i>

<i>Roy reconsidered</i>
<i>his life's purpose.</i>

I was gonna die.

But you didn't.
Yeah, because of him.

I can't go back to the way
things were, Thea.

I c-can't just go back
to being nothing.

I can't explain it,

but it feels like my life is
connected to his.

<i>The incident provided clarity</i>
<i>for Oliver as well.</i>

I've seen that map before.

It's an old map of
a decommissioned subway line.

It runs underneath the low-rent
district of the city.

of our faces the entire time.

My father, the other archer,
the Undertaking...

Whatever the plan is, it's all
connected to the Glades.

which we set for ourselves,

is only months from fruition.

There's hope on the horizon
for everyone in Starling.


We won't fail this city.

And I think I speak
for everyone here

when I say we're all with you,
Malcolm.

<i>But privately,</i>
<i>Moira had misgivings...</i>

I wanna get out.

That's, uh, a lot to confide
in me, Moira.

<i>As did a colleague.</i>

I've gone along with this
for as long as I can stomach.

Frank Chen recommended you.

He said you could help us
with our problem.

How can we be of assistance?

Malcolm Merlyn.

I want you to kill him
for me.

(Malcolm, amplified voice)
The true humanitarian

in the Merlyn family
was my wife Rebecca.

I like to think that if the man
who murdered her knew her,

he would've helped her to
her car, made sure she was safe,

instead of stealing her purse
and shooting her.

(Beep, alarm blaring)

please exit calmly...

<i>Malcolm Merlyn was not</i>
<i>an easy target.</i>

Tommy.

Come with me.

<i>He would not go down</i>
<i>without a fight...</i>

<i>A fact that took his son</i>
<i>by surprise.</i>

Wait!

Let's go!

How did you know
how to do that?

What?
Kill.


(Rapid gunfire)

Dad!


<i>Oliver arrived in time.</i>

Stay back.

I'm not here to hurt you
or your father.

I said stay back.

If you don't let me
help you now,

he's dead before
anybody gets here!

Why should I trust you?!

<i>But there was no time left</i>
<i>for secrets.</i>

'Cause you always have.

Oliver.

(Gasps and groans)

Dad. Oh.
Take it easy.

<i>Thanks to Oliver...</i>

The Vigilante saved you.

He did?

<i>Malcolm Merlyn was alive.</i>

<i>But thanking him wasn't</i>
<i>foremost in Tommy's mind.</i>

I know you have
a lot of questions.

Yeah.

(Inhales deeply)

Yeah, but for now,
just the one.

Were you ever gonna
tell me?

No.

<i>Tommy's distrust of Oliver</i>

quickly grew to include Laurel.

When you first got home,

I didn't think that you had
changed much.

But you have, and...

It's nice to see.



You still love her,
don't you?

It doesn't matter how I feel,

because of what I do,
I could never be with her.

So you don't have anything
to be afraid of.

She is <i>never...</i>

ever going to know
my secret.

It doesn't matter.
She knows.

I know.

But if she ever found out
who you really are...

She would choose you.

(Laurel whispering)
You can't be serious.

I'm not sure that I'm ready
for the kind of commitment

that you're looking for.

And I don't want to hurt you
in the long run, so--

(voice breaks) You're lying.

I am not a liar.

If you've changed,
and I know that you've changed,

you would never do this.

Well, then I guess

I haven't changed as much
as we all thought then.

<i>And Tommy's rejection...</i>

Will you please
go talk to Tommy for me?

<i>Produced</i>
<i>a self-fulfilling prophecy.</i>

And say what?

Say that
you and I are over,

that you're not
still in love with me.

I can't do that.

Why not?

Because it wouldn't be true.

Thank you for coming, Frank.

<i>Merlyn's survival forced Moira</i>
<i>to cover her tracks.</i>

Malcolm knows.

I had no choice

but to turn over what
they've discovered... (Exhales deeply)

The money that you paid
the Triad to assassinate him.

(Arrow whooshes) The money I--
(Inhales sharply)

Moira!

Mr. Merlyn thanks you
for your loyalty.

<i>Moira's paranoia</i>
<i>began to boil over...</i>


You lied to me.
We had a deal!

<i>And so did she.</i>

You promised if I cooperated
with the Undertaking,

Walter wouldn't be harmed!

He hasn't been.
I'm a man of my word, Moira.

I think we both know better
than that.

Turn on the camera.

Oh, Walter.

Like you said, Moira,
we have an agreement.

Walter would stay
in my custody

until the Undertaking
was complete.

We're both in this together.

<i>And Oliver learned</i>
<i>the startling truth</i>

<i>about his mother.</i>

She's working with
Malcolm Merlyn.

And they're
planning something.

Something...

Terrible.

Hey, mom.

<i>After uncovering</i>
<i>his mother's involvement</i>

<i>with Merlyn's plot,</i>

<i>Oliver confronted her</i>
<i>yet again.</i>

Tell me the truth.

I don't know what you mean.

I think you do.

Couple of months ago, when
I showed you Dad's notebook,

you seemed to know
something.

<i>When she continued</i>
<i>to be evasive...</i>

You need to stop asking
these things.

I <i>can't.</i>

I <i>need</i> to know.
(Electricity powers down)

<i>Oliver used</i>
<i>more drastic measures.</i>

(Dart whooshes)

Oh.

Oliver.

(Dart whooshes)
Ohh.

(Breathes heavily)

Moira Queen,
you have failed this city.

Please, do not hurt my son.

Tell me what the Undertaking is,
and I won't have to.


Uhh!
No!

Malcolm is planning
to level the Glades!

How?
There's a device.

He says that it could cause
an earthquake.

Why would you get involved
in something like this?

My husband.

He was lost. He...

His decisions left me
vulnerable to Malcolm.

And I had no choice.

I had to protect my family
and my children.

This device, where is it?

I don't know.

If you don't tell me,
I can't stop Merlyn.

Oh, you can't stop him.

It's too late.

<i>Finally, Oliver understood</i>
<i>his true mission.</i>

It's the Undertaking.

I was just treating the symptoms
while the disease festered.

I stop the Undertaking,
I wipe out the disease.

Merlyn's plan is what I returned
from the island to stop.

For the past five years,

under the threat for my life
and the lives of my family...

<i>Moira finally decided</i>
<i>to come clean.</i>

I have been complicit

in an undertaking
with one horrible purpose--

to destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

The architect of this nightmare
<i>is Malcolm Merlyn.</i>


Yes, and I have proof
that he has killed dozens

in pursuit of this madness.

Is it true?
Did you kill all those people?

I did what I had to do.

Malcolm Merlyn,
you are under arrest!

Don't move!

Dad, no!

Stay back.
I don't wanna hurt you.

You can't,

and you can't stop me.

This red line here

is a known fault that runs
right below the Glades.

For about a mile,
the fault runs underneath

the old
10th Street subway line.

Dollars to doughnuts,

the seismic device is
somewhere along there.

(Cell phone chimes and buzzes)

I know were Merlyn is
keeping the device.

I need someone I can trust
to deactivate the device.

(Sirens wailing)

(Man on TV) Earlier today,
Moira Queen, C.E.O. of...

<i>News of the impending disaster</i>
<i>had already reached the Glades.</i>

<i>As Detective Lance searched</i>
<i>for the device...</i>

(Man on TV
speaking indistinctly)

<i>Everyone prepared</i>
<i>for the worst.</i>

(Man, amplified voice)
Proceed out of the Glades

in an orderly manner.

<i>Oliver and Diggle moved in</i>
<i>to take Merlyn down.</i>

Welcome, gentlemen.
I've been waiting for you.

I wanted to see you watch
your city die.

Uhh! Aah!

Aah!


You should see something

that looks like a circuit board.
Okay.

Felicity talked Detective Lance
<i>through disarming the weapon...</i>

Do you see a timer?

(Continues beeping)
7 minutes.

Okay.

<i>While Oliver battled</i>
<i>to stop its damage.</i>

Cut the blue one.
All right, I got it. I got it.


Oh!

(Beeping resumes)

Holy God.

(Tires screech)
Roy!

Thea tracked down Roy Harper...

Roy, stop! Look!
(People screaming at once)

The device is about to go off
any second!

<i>But she couldn't persuade him</i>
<i>to abandon his home.</i>

I leave any of them behind.

Look, I-I know you said
you have something to prove,

but you're not the vigilante.

I can't do this unless
I know you're safe.

Then you better haul ass
out of here, too.

With chaos erupting everywhere,

<i>Oliver had one final chance to</i>
<i>prevent complete destruction.</i>

Don't struggle.
It's over.

Don't worry.

Your mother and sister will
be joining you in death. (Groans)

Aah!


(Beeping continues)

(Powers down)

Oliver, Lance did it.

It's over.

If I've learned anything
as a successful businessman,

it's... (Exhales sharply)


Redundancy.


(Electricity humming)

There's two of them.


Oliver Queen came back to right
<i>his father's wrongs.</i>

<i>He couldn't have imagined</i>
<i>how severe they were.</i>


Uhh! Aah!

<i>He returned to a city</i>

<i>suffocated by corruption</i>
<i>and violence...</i>

Laurel!

The damage seems to be
contained

on the east side.
Laurel.

Go. Go, go, go.

<i>And he fought</i>
<i>to make it better...</i>

Please! Help me!

<i>To make the people around him</i>
<i>better.</i>

(Strained voice) Tommy.
What are you doing here?

I love you.

<i>True heroism is defined</i>
<i>by sacrifice...</i>

I'm right behind you!

Dad!

<i>And real heroes...</i>

No!
No, Laurel!

<i>Are the ones</i>
<i>who give up the most.</i>

Come on. It's too late!
It's too late. (Sobbing)

(Speaks indistinctly)

Tommy.

Is--is Laurel safe?

Is Laurel safe?

Yeah. You saved her.

I'm--I'm sorry.

(Voice breaks) No.

Don't apologize.

And--no.

Tommy. (Crying)

<i>After the tragedy</i>
<i>in the Glades,</i>

<i>we must wonder...</i>


<i>What will Oliver Queen</i>
<i>become now?</i>

<i>Something else yet again?</i>

<i>Perhaps something...</i>

<i>Better.</i>
