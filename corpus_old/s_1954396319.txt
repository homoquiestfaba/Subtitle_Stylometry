       upsetting for him.       

       No one's ever dared      
         to go in there.        

     You think that's gonna     
         cause a ruckus?

        >> Get over here!       

  Mike Boettcher: What is that? 

            >> R.P.G.           

       Camera Man: R.P.G.?      

          >> Oh my god.         

>> That thing is straight out   
of China, like, yesterday.      

            >> Yeah.            

Mike: How could they            
get out of China?               

>> Yeah. That thing's           
brand spanking new.             

      >> I'm down here, on      
       Objective Richmond,      

and, uh, first platoon can't    
get to the first                
series of building.             

        They keep finding       
        more ammunition.        

     They keep finding more     
     mortar fuses.              

  They keep finding more stuff. 

   >> I don't know what it is.  

It's a rifle. Bolt              
action of some sort.            

 Mike: What does that look like?

    >> Six to seven R.P.G.'s,   
     probably eight mortars,    

    a couple box of fuses...    

>> Definitely an indicator that 
  we caught them by surprise.   

             Break.             

      [suspenseful sounds]

We've got contact up on the

 Holding six, moving three six. 

>> Yeah. Roger. Where are you   
     getting fire from?         

          What target?          

   [indistinct radio chatter]

        Mike: My name is        
         Mike Boettcher.        

 For the past thirty-four years,

my job has given me a front     
row seat to history.            

     As a war correspondent,    

it's taken me to some of the    
worst places on the planet.     

     [dramatic music plays]     

Everything that I have achieved 
in my career has come at a high 

price. It cost me my            
relationship with my            

family and my son. I've         
missed Christmases,             

    birthdays, graduations...   

           [chuckles]           

You name it. So                 
when it was time                

for me to re-embed with U.S.    
Troops in                       

Afghanistan, my son, Carlos,    
decided he was coming, with     

or without my permission. He    
said, "I need to know why you   

chose your work over us." As    
much as I wanted to             

say no, I realized this could   
be my last chance               

to reconnect with my son. So    
off we went... together,        

father and son. The             
only trick was...               

we had to come out of           
there alive.                    

        [dramatic sounds]       

       [rock music plays]       

       [helicopter whirs]       

      [helicopter passing]      

>> Looks like they attached two 
different wires to try          

and make an I.D., maybe         
stretch out the wire            

so they could get further away  
from us, when they              

detonate, gives themself a      
better chance to get away.      

>> For power? Where             
does it go to?                  

    >> Right into the house.    

>> Well, I know, uh, I know in  
his house. I can see that.      

I meant, when it goes in here.  
Where is it                     

     getting the power from?    

      [inaudible response]      

      >> Hey, Gould, Gould!     

   [indistinct radio chatter]

Camera Man: What were           
you saying again?               

         [radio chatter]        

>> He's next to the vehicle.    
Why?                            

 >> So you're a good luck charm?

            >> Whoa!            

    >> Whoa! Son of a bitch!    

      >> Yeah, still warm,      
           still warm.          

>> Yeah, we got a bunch of      
these that we were just shot    

at by the enemy from that       
hillside. This is               

a Dishka round, uh,             
little over twelve              

millimeter diameter, round,     
very deadly when it hits you.   

     [dramatic music plays]     

            [gunfire]           

Chris Fields: And               
then watch me.                  

Hey, I'll either go up, left,   
right, or back.                 

            [gunfire]           

     >> He's still too low!     

     >> Oh, nice. Good shot.    

     >> One person injured.     

      >> They are reporting     
  everything's okay right now.  

            >> Good.            

   >> It's not gonna be okay.   

They don't, they don't know     
what's about to hit 'em.        

         [radio chatter]        

  >> Roger that. I need to go   
  tothe left of that.           

   There's a rat drill on the   
   left side of that.           

    Give me, uh, three shots    
    rightthere for right now,   

       so we're gonna you       
          right on her.         

            [gunfire]           

      [jet passes overhead]     

       >> Yeah! Good hit!       

     [dramatic music plays]     

           [explosion]          

         >> Whoa, baby!         

           [explosion]          

    >> Two-zero-seven, dark     
    knightfour-two.             

  It's good bombs, good bombs.  

       >> There's a false       
        bravado involved.       

    They see us. They've been   
     watching us for awhile.    

They're moving in position.     
They don't think we             
can harm them.                  

      Uh, they just haven't     
         fought us yet.         

     [dramatic music plays]     

>> How close were those         
bullets coming to you?          

You were close enough to hear   
the bzzzz go by, huh?           

  >> Gunfire buzzes when it's   
  close enough to you.          

  It sounds like a bee passing  
  over your shoulder,           

  and that's when we knew that  
  things were serious.

      [country song plays]      

       [helicopter whirs]       

        >> Steve Lutsky,        
         Colonel Lutsky.        

 Lutsky was this character who  
 was larger than life.          

    He lived to be out front.   

       [soldiers chanting]      

Colonel Steve Lutsky: I expect  
these guys to risk their        

lives to get the mission done.  
I mean, mission comes first.    

I can't ask them to do          
something that I                
wouldn't do myself.             

Now, that's not saying that     
I'mlooking for a fight,         

but I can't sit in a            
truck and say,                  

"Hey, I want you to go          
risk your life."                

>> It was a fight to stay alive 
when you were with              
Steve Lutsky,                   

because he was going to be at   
that pointy end of the spear.   

    And sure enough, we were.   

>> Tag two, tag one, over.      
They saw three,                 

uh, possible insurgents.        
They went us to head            

southwest along the ridge.      
Over.                           

       [voice over radio]       

         >> They were regressing
           straight south from  
             that location.     

Staying in that low land ridge, 
they're probably                

   hiding somewhere out there,  
         behind the rock        

      the rock line, break.     

>> The problem was, the Taliban 
found us before we found them.  

          [clattering]          

       [soldiers yelling]       

       [heartbeat sounds]       

         >> I'm up here         
        [unintelligible]!       

        [dramatic sounds]       

>> The problem is, he had no    
idea where they were            

firing from. The Soviets call   
them "Ghosts," and they         

were. I mean, you couldn't...   
They were there. They were      

somewhere, and they were        
shooting at us.                 

     You couldn't see them.     

 [soldiers yelling indistinctly]

        [heavy breathing]       

            [gunfire]           

            >> Yeah.            

Snipers firing from us,         
in the tree line                

over there. Snipers             
firing at us from the           

tree line just over there,      
behind some                     

      cover, but not much.      

        [dramatic sounds]       

    >> They want us to go up.   

         >> Okay, okay.         

      [indistinct yelling]      

       >> Okay, I'm going.      

           Here we go.

            [grunts]            

            Carlos!!            

     >> I had no idea if he     
     was alive or not.          

I wasn't a reporter then. I     
was being a pop.                

      [solemn music plays]      

And the one thing I could not   
let happen was...               

was to let my son die.          

          Mike: Carlos!         

             Carlos!

            [gunfire]           

             Carlos!            

Mike: What the hell             
were you thinking?              

I told you, don't               
leave my side.                  

This is a damn war zone,        
Carlos.                         

You okay? Well, you were        
covering me, as well, right?    

         >> Roger. Yes.         

   To the best of my ability,   
             I was.             

>> I thought you did pretty     
goodat covering me.             

           [chuckles]           

           >> Thanks.           

       >> Hey, by the way,      
        their aim sucks.        

  >> Okay, ambushes along the   
  road are one of many          

     reasons construction's     
         taken so long,         

   with mountainside... Fuck.   
          I fucked up.          

      [background chatter]      

 Ambushes along the road are one

 of many reasons construction's 

    taken so long, with the     
    mountainside providing      

    no cover, and insurgents    
      offering no quarter.      

>> All right. That was good.    

       >> Any suggestions?      

    >> We're getting ready to   
      clearthat ridge line.     

       Uh, at least one of      
          them got hit.         

   Uh, we saw him go down, so   
        we're gonna check       

 for bullet trails and, uh, see 
       if we can find him.      

      A.W.T. has nothing on     
         him right now.         

      [dramatic percussion]     

        >> You all right?       

>> These are the first houses   
that they would bring him to.   

  Mike: The guy who's wounded?  

            >> Yeah.            

      [background chatter]      

  >> Hear any of the shooting?  

        [speaking arabic]       

      Translator: Yeah, we      
       heard the fighting.      

   >> One of them was wounded,  
           so you may           

 have them come down and cometo 
      your house for help.      

I understand, Polesh and Wally, 
that you're going to help them. 

  Did they come to your house?  

        [speaking arabic]       

   Translator: He says you can  
     search, uh, the houses.    

>> Oh, they already are.        
They're up there                
searching right now.            

        [speaking arabic]       

        [dramatic sounds]       

       >> Watch your head.      

    >> What the hell is this?   

   >> I, I don't think you're   
    Taliban, but I think you    

    turn the other way when     
    Taliban come through.       

    >> We had to arrest the     
    insurgents and tell them    

    they're not welcome here.   
       'Cause I want your       

  children to be safe. I want   
  you to be safe too.           

        [speaking arabic]       

       [voice over radio]       

       >> I need a roger.       

>> Yeah, we're in route at this 
time. A, uh, actually           

  developed this situation for  
        what we need, we        

 need to know when you think we 
     should come in from the    

  south, and do it right past,  
   past the way, north. Over.   

       >> Six four, roger.      

   >> That'll be six-four-six.

   traveling this direction.    

         The other way,         
       civilian vehicles.       

    They slowed down when the   
         convey passed.         

    So did a suicide bomber,    
       and inside his car,      

  he has six hundred pounds of  
        high explosives.        

     [dramatic music plays]     

    Rhyss Heeter: After we      
    realized what happened,     

        we pushed out of        
        the blast zone.         

   I got out of the truck. We   
  realized it was a "vee-bid."  

          [explosions]          

  There was a lady off to the   
  side, next to a, uh, kalat,   

 and uh, she was screaming that 
       her kids were dead.      

    I started calling for the   
      medic over the radio,     

 and we just started treating   
them, did everything we could.  

Mike: Private Richter, how long 
you been in the Army?           

Paxton Richter: Uh, exactly a   
year, sir. That was the first   

actual, uh, trauma casualty     
I'd... in my care, sir.

        hundred percent.        

>> I looked at the eyes of the  
medics, and you could see it.   

 They weren't gonna let him die.

  [melancholy music continues]  

    >> The name of the child?   
          We were more          

         concerned about        
       saving his leg than      

        getting his name.       

       >> The family has a      
       patient over here.       

       >> How's he doing?       

       >> Doing okay. He's      
      supposed to be going,     

  hopefully, to the O.R. today. 

    >> Going back to the O.R.   
             today?             

     >> I'm very happy that     
        he kept his leg.        

      We go out of our way      
      to make sure              

       people like Sadich       
         don't get hurt.        

   Mike: In the end, does it    
   change Afghanistan?          

   Probably not, but it saved   
   that kid's life,             

and maybe that kid will change  
     Afghanistan someday.       

   >> Get well. We'll see you.  

    I got a son, Jake, who's    
    ten years old.              

     Mike: Can you imagine?     

             >> No.             

Mike: Did it sink into you that 
you had saved a child's life?   

>> It did, but uh, that's,      
that's what I'm here.           

That's why all these guys that  
are out here do what they do.   

        It's 'cause they        
        just wanna help.        

      >> Afterwards, ground     
       unit came up by and      

    thanked us, and that was    
      probably the biggest      

reward, uh, that I've ever had, 
is having the                   

     ground unit come by and    
         say thank you.         

>> This all-woman crew who put  
 any men I've known to shame.   

I call it, you know, the band   
of sisters and a                
little brother.                 

>> We just consider ourselves   
  just soldiers, like, like     

 everyone else, and to us, it's 
     really not a big deal.     

  >> The countdown to hugs and  
   kisses, and this is Chloe.   

         She's so cute!         

   I'm a mom. I understand how  
     every other mom feels,     

and if I was in her shoes, that 
I'd want those people           

 to help my son or daughter out 
      as much as possible.      

        [dramatic sounds]       

        [speaking arabic]       

    >> Kids are the ones that   
        usually give all        

      the good information.     
       Taliban do the same      

        thing, from what        
       we've experienced.       

   They'll usually go tell the  
         kids where they        

    put in an I.E.D. The kids   
       seem to be the, uh,      

    the best guys to utilize    
         for references.        

        [speaking arabic]       

    >> I talked to some kids    
    here on scene.              

    They confirm Taliban had    
    placed an I.E.D.            

         here about, uh,        
     forty-eight hours ago.     

  >> The villages are the ones  
    that actually came to us,   

      and, and A.U.P. and       
      reportedthis I.E.D.       

   In my mind, I mean, that's   
         a very positive        

    step. Seems like they're    
    starting to kind of, you    

  know, support the government  
       a little bit more.       

      [dramatic percussion]     

 [indistinct background chatter]

   >> Naw, I love doing this.   

          Mike: Really?         

             >> Yep.            

             >> Why?            

  >> 'Cause right now, my job   
  is to help protect            

   these guys, make sure they   
         don't get hurt.        

        [ominous sounds]        

        [ominous sounds]        

        [ominous sounds]        

>> Yep, got the pressure plate. 

     >> Hey, they found the     
         pressure plate.        

     >> Pressure plates on      
     both sides and             

     a power source for each    
         pressure plate.        

             >> Yep.            

   >> Wire running off to the   
   side. There's a little hole  

 dug right there, with the wires
      running down into it.     

     >> It's about twelve to    
  fourteen inches in diameter.  

>> In this area, we haven't     
seen charges that big.          

       It would have done       
        some damage too.        

  >> Yeah, it's pretty, it's a  
      pretty large charge.      

    But uh, we've definitely    
        located, uh, one        

  pressure plate at this time.  
         Uh, exploiting         

         with the robot.

        [dramatic sounds]       

        [sirens wailing]        

          >> Holy hell.         

      Mike: How much you        
      think was in there?       

  >> Forty to fifty pounds. I'd 
       say probably closer      

    to the fifty pound range.   

      >> Tell all the kids      
        that they need to       

    stay away from that area,   
             'cause             

    there still could be some   
        stuff out there.        

    They're doing a lot more    
  patrolling around this area,  

and they'll continue to focus   
specifically around this area,  

 now that we know that bad guys 
 are putting I.E.D.s.           

        [dramatic sounds]       

  Mike: My intent is for us to  
  get in there, and             

      then get out of there     
          in one piece.         

            >> Yeah.            

             [sighs]            

 Well, my, my intent is always, 
           is also to           

 get out of there in one piece, 
               so.              

  >> But let's not do anything  
      fucking stupid, huh?      

   We have a mission tonight,   
           from here,           

      past those mountains,     
         into the always        

     dangerous river valley.    

>> I believe in each and        
every one of you,               

and I love each and             
every one of you.               

You're the most precious        
resource that America has.      

Trust in your brothers,         
dedicate yourself to            

American battalion              
and our mission.                

Your measure is not             
found in how                    

much time you have              
on this earth.                  

It's what you do with the       
time that you've had.           

These people have               
suffered for too                

long. Change the                
course of history               

         in Afghanistan.        

         [wind howling]         

     [dramatic music plays]     

Mike: We had marched            
for days with the               

Marines. It was summer,         
and it was hot.                 

One hundred thirty degrees.     
Unbelievable.                   

And we did it all carrying more 
than eighty pounds              

of gear on our back. We ran     
out of everything.              

We ran out of food. We          
ran out of water.               

   Mike: And then, we got,      
finally, to the location that   

   we're supposed to capture.   

This could be Gulf Company's    
new home. They're               

looking for headquarters to     
establish their                 

presence down here, and we're   
going in to check.              

It's been eerily quiet. We      
haven't had a bullet            

fired at us in over             
twelve hours.                   

      [indistinct yelling]      

      [indistinct yelling]      

  [middle eastern music plays]  

         >> This is it!         

      >> Okay, let's get a      
         team up there.         

    >> Next team, coming up!    

   [indistinct radio chatter]   

>> Roger. Fox One is clearing   
     the area right now.        

     [dramatic music plays]     

           >> Go! Go!           

            Hot, hot!           

          [explosions]          

  >> Go! Let's go, go, go, go!  

      [explosions continue]     

   [indistinct radio chatter]   

         Go, go, go, go!        

          >> Oh my god.         

    Mike: What is this here?    

 >> This is, uh, nitrate to, uh,
          make I.E.D.s.         

>> And this is pure heroine     
down here, you said?            

 Mike: So what do we have here? 

>> Walled compounds like this   
 one fill Helmand Province,     

  providing valuable cover for  
    Taliban, and for Marines.   

>> Marines say the objective of 
    this mission was met -      

  to plant their presence here  
   and to make a statement to   

  the Taliban that the Marines  
        are not leaving.        

     Mike: We knew that we'd    
    accomplished our mission,   

    and I was up all night      
    feeding stories back to     

      ABC. I was exhausted.     
          Everyone was.         

And the Marine commander said,  
"We gotta go                    
another ten miles."             

     [dramatic music plays]     

     There is a squad that's    
       surrounded. Someone      

   else has to go, and Carlos   
      came to me, as I was      

   suiting up, and said, "Pop,  
            if you do           

   this, you're gonna die." I   
   was just too tired.          

  He said, "I'll go. Not you."  

           [chuckles]           

 That's my son... saying he'll  
 go in place of me.             

   And he went, and I stayed.   

     >> Hey, do I got any       
     friendlies over there?     

        >> Right or left?       

 >> Uh, go left of the compound.
           Keep going           

      all the way over. You     
         got the dude in        

      the white turban that     
      keeps looking at us?      

            >> Yeah.            

            >> Yeah.            

          >> Naw, it's          
      definitely not them.      

          >> All right.         

    >> Set south, southwest.    

     Carlos: While movement     
       through the fields       

 and canals is slow, every step 
       the Marines take is      

  one closer to securing peace  
      in Helmand Province.      

    >> Here at Camp Koshtay,    
            the work            

   continues. The Marines are   
   now in the position          

 of setting up this base, in the
       heart of this town       

   called Koshtay, which was a  
       Taliban stronghold.      

  Mike: There's a copper wire.  
          Where is it?          

Oh, yes. And it's running up to 
that compound there.            

      A patrol this morning     
         found an I.E.D.        

 We're walking towards it. They 
 cut the command wire,          

 which is a wire that runs to a 
 device that would trigger      

  the bomb. Hopefully, that is  
  the only command wire.        

   Voice over radio: Command,   
           three two.           

    Mike: When you enlisted,    
           you didn't           

   ask for this job, did you?   

          >> Negative.          

        [engines humming]       

  Mike: The villagers did not   
  come. The Taliban             

did not attack. But the         
question now is - where         
is the Taliban?                 

      [dramatic percussion]     

          >> Stand by!          

 >> Hey, we got two people, six 
       hundred meters away      

   from us, moving southeast.   

      [indistinct chatter]      

        [distant gunfire]

       [gunfire continues]      

             >> Huh?            

       >> Hey, what is he       
         talking about?         

  Send your traffic, O.P. Rock. 

       >> I got pan left.       

      >> Shoot him, dammit!     

           [gun fires]          

      [dramatic percussion]     

  >> I shot that motherfucker   
  that walked by the compound   

  down there. I don't know if I 
     fucking hit him or not.    

 Saw him running with a fucking 
        A.K. in his hand.       

  I don't know if I fucking hit 
      that son of a bitch.      

          >> Shoot him!         

       [gunfire continues]      

       >> Hey, guns and         

  >> I hit that son of a bitch. 

             >> Go!             

          [clattering]          

  >> Did you see those fuckers? 

      [indistinct chatter]      

     [dramatic music plays]     

   Mike: Just last night, the   
    platoons of Gulf Company    

     Two-Eight Marines were     
     attacked by small arms     

   fire eleven times, uh,       
resulting in two concussions.   

  It was very lucky that, uh,   
  there were no major           

   casualties, or no deaths on  
     this march south here.

       We're taking fire!       

Mike: All I heard on the radio  
was that they were in trouble,  

  and he was surrounded, and    
there were Taliban all around,  

      and they were taking      
        fire constantly.        

       [breathing heavily]      

       [gunfire continues]

    Mike: Being reunited with   
   Carlos after that... to see  

 him alive... was the best damn 

thing I've ever seen. The best. 

     [dramatic music plays]     

   >> Initially, I was scared   
     going into it. We heard    

    that there was gonna be     
    gunfire directed at us,     

    all the way down, and so    
      there was, but after      

the first few explosions, after 
  the initial contact, after    

 the initial rat-tat-tat of the 
       A.K.-47s coming at       

us, uh, the adrenaline almost   
   fades and you being to       

       grow, if not numb,       
        then used to it.        

Mike: Carlos grew up real fast, 
  and I was so proud of him.    

  My time is almost over, and   
  now it's Carlos's             

  turn, and I believe my son is 
      going to be a better      

  storyteller than I ever was.  
         It's his turn.         

   Diane Sawyer: We want you    
   to meet two people           

who are unlike any other, the   
  only team of journalists      

 to embed for one solid year, on
      the front lines, with     

the troops here, and not only   
that - they're father and son.  

       They are Mike and        
       Carlos Boettcher.        

       >> And about twelve      
     minutes into it, I was     

   just dying. I was just, my   
   whole, it was like           

   the thing where your whole   
         body overheats,        

   and I started to feel like   
   asthmatic, which, probably   

 'cause I smoke too much, but it
     was just way too much.     

   >> Yeah, yeah, you gotta...  
         See, my joints         

   have a limited shelf life,   
   so that's why                

        you don't see me        
        hitting the gym.        

         >> Yeah, true.         

           [chuckling]          

     [dramatic music plays]     

  Mike: Carlos's time was up,   
  and after everything          

    we'd experienced here, it   
         was going to be        

 tough to watch him go back to  
 the States without me.         

   You wake up every morning,   
          facing death,         

      and you cherish every     
       moment you're with       

   the people you're with, and  
        here I was, with        

  my son, and ironically, in a  
    war zone, we reconnected.   

  It was worth the risk to be   
  a father again.               

       [helicopter whirs]       

    But, I think, deep down,    
    as afather,                 

   I was relieved that Carlos   
        was headed home,        

     because I knew where we    
         weregoing next         

   was one of the worst places  
         you could go in        

     Afghanistan. It was the    
       heart of darkness.       

        [dramatic sounds]       

Tye Reedy: Q.Z.R.               
controls the entire             

northern part of our            
area of operation.              

He controls, uh, the fighters,  
the                             

equipment, uh, the training,    
everything.                     

He's our number one target.     
It's an                         

extremely important mission.    

>> Now, you're gonna have a lot 
of young, inexperienced         

fighters, who want to go to toe 
to toe with an American,        

    and they'll get their ass   
     handed to them, because    

      they don't know what      
         they're doing.         

    They just graduated that    
        [unintelligible],       

    so they've been instilled   
       with that bullshit       

   extremist philosophy. They   
     don't know any better.     

    Let 'em come to you. Let    
            'em come to you.    

   >> We can't just air strike  
    them. It would do no good   

 to kill him or our enemy, along
       with civilians, so       

      we have to go in, put     
      boots on the ground,      

    and root these guys out.    

  Matthew Mendez: As a leader,  
       you have to, as my       

son calls it, manning up, so... 
that's what, that's what I did. 

>> This is gonna be the final   
 nail in the coffin against     

 this asshole. He's going down. 
 His abilities to               

fight in the future are gonna   
be extremely degraded. We're    

   gonna create a lot of good   
      things for the people     

  that don't have the reach of  
       security forces or       

   governments as a result of   
     this. That's all I got.    

  [all respond unintelligibly]  

Kevin Mott: I don't             
think anybody was               

necessarily prepared for        
exactly what it                 

was gonna be like,              
but some of us                  

had the worst in mind,          
mentally prepared               

that way, so we wouldn't have   

         any surprises.         

        [dramatic sounds]       

    Mike: After almost dying,   
          why would you         

       wanna come back to       
         this hellhole?         

             [sighs]            

>> I think it was... a personal 
    thing, on a level that,     

  you know, I wasn't gonna let  
  these guys beat me.           

     [dramatic music plays]     

    I've been through quite a   
        few fire fights.        

     I'm not different than     
          anybody else.         

   I wanted to get back, get    
   back in the fight,           

whether it be sitting in this   
    three shop, you know,       

 doing paperwork or whatever, I 
      wanted to come back.      

         [music swells]         

      [helicopter whirring]     

        [ominous sounds]        

    Mike: We landed at three    
         in the morning,        

    and all of us were tense.   

  >> Now, based off the map, it 
    looked like there was a,    

      a trail that we could     
       have taken to head.      

     Pretty sure it does not    
          exist at all.         

    It just some trickery the   
         imagery showed.        

   >> I'm glad we waited til    
   daybreak to actually move,   

     because somebody would     
          have actually         

  broke their leg or, or worse. 

     [dramatic music plays]     

        [speaking arabic]       

      >> Hey, Ramone, take      
         the low trail!         

  >> Going through the kalats,  
        uh, you can tell,       

 men, men did live there. They  
 just weren't there,            

 and the, uh, excuse they gave  
 of that they were,             

  um, day workers in Jalalabad, 
            you know,           

    is completely ridiculous.   

        [dramatic sounds]       

        [speaking arabic]       

          >> Hey, Zee?          

          >> What's up?         

    >> Give me eyes on that     
    bridge at your eleven.      

          [explosions]          

            [gunfire]           

>> That shit sounds like it's   
right in front of us.           

        >> Yeah, it does.       

     [gun firing repeatedly]    

    >> We have landed in the    
         hornet's nest.         

       >> Stay down. Stay       
        behind Jim Coper.       

     >> This was command and    
    controls for the Taliban,   

   right there in that valley.  

       [gunfire continues]      

      [indistinct yelling]      

       And they were gonna      
          make us pay.          

        [speaking arabic]       

  [middle eastern music plays]  

       [gunfire continues]      

>> Hey, we gotta start getting  
 them in this fucking kalat.    

Can we get the fucking sixties  
 up on this fucking hilltop?    

    >> Yeah, they're working    
        on it right now.        

>> All right, this is, this     
is them right here,             

above phase line white,         
this is us                      

down here, the grid             
liner section.                  

            >> Okay.            

>> They're righthere.           
They got packs                  

moving up and down              
this ridge line,                

generally east of them.         

      [indistinct chatter]      

       [gunfire continues]      

      >> They're there! I       
      saw 'em moving!           

            >> Fizzo?           

            >> Yeah?            

 >> Make shit start blowing up! 

       [aircraft overhead]      

        >> R.P.G. seven!        

        >> R.P.G. seven!        

          >> Oh, shit!          

           [explosion]          

         [muted sounds]         

Mike: In this muddy, friggin'   
hillside, we were surrounded,   

   and I thought, "What's it    
   gonna feel like when         

  the bullet comes through me?" 

        [dramatic sounds]       

       [gunfire continues]      

  [indistinct voice over radio] 

   >> Go ahead, one-six Romeo.  

       [voice over radio]       

   >> Six-three-six, stand by.  

      [bullets whizzing by]     

   >> Three pads, two urgent,   
          one priority.         

 >> Break, break, break, break! 

  >> Yankee, Delta, zero, four, 
      niner, three, eight,      

  six, five, four, one, three,  
              zero.             

       Mike: I was sitting      
          there on this         

   mountainside, hearing their  
      radio calls come in.      

   [indistinct radio chatter]   

  "We need choppers now. These  
      guys are gonna die."      

            >> Roger.           

   [indistinct radio chatter]   

       >> Dammit. I need        
       that Medevac now.        

   >> And you knew... choppers  
         weren't coming.        

>> Tell them, "Hey, the bird's  
  coming, the bird's coming,    

    just hang in there. The     
    bird's coming."             

      After awhile, you...      
        the person saying       

     it is getting tired and    
       under-sure, and the      

  person hearing it is getting  
      tired and under-sure.     

        >> Star cluster?        

             [sighs]            

        [dramatic sounds]       

         >> There he is!        

    [helicopter approaching]    

      >> Medevac's inbound?     

 >> Yeah. They're in the valley.

         >> Hell, yeah!         

           [cheering]           

 >> You pull in, turn sideways, 
             and...             

  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. 
      You just get lit up.      

            [gunfire]           

   >> Made multiple attempts,   
            until the           

     bird was, you know, it     
         was damaged so         

      bad, it actually had      
         to go and land         

   for immediate maintenance.   

     [dramatic music plays]     

        >> Fuck! Dammit!        

     >> A kick in the balls,    
       more than anything.      

  As soon as we got 'em here,   
  we just lost 'em              

     again. Um... So we had     
     to wait again.             

  >> It was a very low moment,  
       because you knew...      

nothing could get there to you. 
     You were on your own.      

nothing could get there to you. 
     You were on your own.      

>> It went through everybody's  
    mind that, you know...      

  this might be the day. This,  
     this might be the day.     

  Mike: You don't know who you  
      are, how far you will     

     go, until that moment,     
          when you know         

  someone is dying, and if you  
        don't get there,        

they're going to die, and you   
may die trying to save them.    

      And that's what these     
          soldiers did.         

>> Hey, tell 'em, tell 'em I    
want a gun run from             

fucking west to east, running   
     up this spur here.         

>> Arrechaga and the lead       
section had already started     

moving, roughly twenty          
   minutes before.              

    It probably took a couple   
         minutes before,        

   uh, they got ambushed. The   
         insurgents that        

     were attacking certain     
       Arrechaga realized       

    that they had caught 'em    
         in a bad spot.         

           [explosion]

      [dramatic percussion]     

      [dramatic percussion]     

  >> In the draw. Hey, they're  
      in the draw, Meyers.      

>> Roger, sir. Nine-five-nine-  
     th hr re ee e, hey,        

    we got eyes on 'em in the   
         draw now. Over.        

>> Hey! We'll provide coverage  
  fire. You guys come to me!    

            [gunfire]           

         >> Cease fire!         

   [indistinct radio chatter]   

         >> What's that?        

    >> What I heard was, uh,    
    A.C.'s down. My             

       men need help. It        
       just clicked into        

      my head. It was like      
         muscle memory.         

       You just run, you        
       just run to them.        

    >> Hey, Wade, get ready!    

         >> Ready, sir!         

 >> All right, let's get moving.

     >> Let's go, let's go!     

            [gunfire]           

     [dramatic music plays]     

Mike: In the middle of this     
battle, Specialist Lindskog,    

      this timid young man      
        who you wouldn't        

        expect would do         
        anything heroic,        

runs through a hail of gunfire, 
to try to save                  

    his fellow soldiers and     
    another Afghan soldier.     

     >> Let's go, let's go!     

            [gunfire]           

            >> Move!            

             >> Go!             

   >> Move, move, move, move,   
              move!             

           [explosion]          

     [dramatic music plays]     

   Kellis Richardson: As soon   
   as I said, "Let's            

  go," he grabbed his bag and   
  took off running.             

        He didn't ask a         
        single question.        

   He just grabbed his bag and  

     stayed right behind me.    

>> I looked back and I saw      
him grab his, his,              

his, uh, his side. He           
was our medic.                  

         >> Lindskog was        
       coherent enough to       

    talk to Sizemore and tell   
        him,"Hey do this        

      for thay guy, do this     
         for that guy."         

       >> He wanted to do       
       everything he could      

   to give us medical advice,   
            while he            

 was hit, on how to treat him.  

 >> He treated three people in, 
              like,             

    a matter of ten minutes.    

   >> Oh, he was fully alert.   
           He talked,           

  up until the point he passed, 
          uh, actually          

    apologized for not being    
        able to hang on.        

  >> When he was sitting there  
  bleeding out, he              

    apologized... for dying.    

     >> Go ahead, three-six.    

     [gunfire in background]    

            >> Roger.           

             [sighs]            

   >> How do you process that?  

 As a reporter with a camera...

           >> Fucker!           

       [voice over radio]       

   >> Roger, we don't know...   

>> Give me this radio. Get      
it on battalion.                

      >> When we gun it, a      
        three hundred and       

    sixty degree fire fight,    
       coming down on our       

     current position. You      
     should have it, right?     

         >> Fuck, dude!         

 >> I tried to let you know as, 
        soon as I saw it.       

   >> Okay, listen up. Prepare  
       to copy, all right?      

   I got two urgent surgicals.  
             They're            

   at building one-three-zero.  

            [gunfire]           

         [muted sounds]         

>> I could tell by A.C.'s tone  
of voice that, uh... I'm, I'm   

pretty sure he didn't think he  
was gonna make it out of there. 

     [dramatic music plays]     

>> Looked to A.C. like, "A.C.,  
     this is gonna hurt."       

   At that point, he was like,  
       "I don't care. I'll      

  take the pain. I just wanna   
  get out of here."             

      [helicopter whirring]     

 >> He actually, you know, did  
 us the big A.C. smile.         

 >> Couldn't explain, in words, 
 how I felt...                  

 After helping them out, having 
       to run down there,       

     all that effort... and     
       you know, the only       

       thing that I could       
        question myself,        

     which I try not to do,     
           is I could           

   have ran faster, you know.   

          >> Watch it!          

      [indistinct yelling]      

            [gunfire]           

       >> Go, go, go, go!       

            Go, man!            

            >> Shit.            

          >> You okay?          

   >> It's definitely exposed.  

          >> Get back.          

         >> Come on. Get        
        farther in there.       

        >> Hey, go in the       
         fucking doors.         

          >> Hey, Kent!         

         >> Loaded, sir.        

       >> He's right here.      

     >> All right, breathe.     

      Who else was with us?     

          >> Albright.          

    >> Albright, right here.    

          >> Albright?          

              So...             

  >> Two, three, four, five...  

        >> Hey, where's,        
         where's Meyers?        

          >> He, he, he         
       didn't make it up.       

     >> Hey, Meyers! Meyers!    

  [middle eastern music plays]  

Brit Jacobs: This is            
Strong Eagle Three.             

Got up to our over watch        

position. Uh, wasn't...         
wasn't that easy,               

uh, this time, as,              
as it has been                  

      in other operations.      

>> He actually had to fix his   
boot. His shoelace              

was busted, so we were just     
joking around a little bit.     

>> Let's talk about the         
 seven layers of hell.          

       >> Yeah. Right here      
         in Afghanistan.        

>> Well, I think we're at about 
    layer four or five now.     

           [chuckles]           

   >> I heard, like, a couple   
     Afghanis talking, like,    

      really quiet, just a      
      couple whispers,          

     and they were right in     
         the trees above        

         us, and I asked        
        Sergeant Burgess,       

 like, we don't have no A and A 
    right next to us, right?    

 And he said, "No," and soon as,
      soon as he said no...     

    I heard, I heard 'em flip   
    their, flip their weapon    

      to fire, and started      
        opening up on us.       

            [gunfire]           

        [dramatic sounds]       

  >> I'm looking at the trees,  
        just, you know...       

They're literally in            
the trees firing                

down at us. What is,            
what kind of                    

       crazy crap is that?      

   >> I started shooting up in  
        the trees, 'cause       

  they were directly above us,  
               and              

     it was all pretty much     
        chaos from there.       

        [bullet whizzes]        

Eric Matheson: We made          
a plan to get                   

the hell out of there, and,     
and make sure                   

we radioed it forward           
to the rest of                  

the element, which we did,      
and we                          

all got up out of there,        
and unbeknownst to              

us, the gun team stayed behind, 
including                       

Smith, Mark Gonzalez, uh,       
Jeremy Faulkner...              

            [gunfire]           

      [indistinct yelling]      

           >> Go, man!          

 >> That's when Jeremy was, uh, 
        shot and killed.        

    >> We can't fucking move,   
            and we're           

  waiting on this stuff -- Hey! 

       [indistinct yelling      

Bryan Smith: I heard my         
buddies saying                  

       that they were hit.      

>> I heard the radio go on,     
and I heard                     

someone kind of whimpering.     
No one                          

told me that there              
were casualties.                

I knew, because of              
that whimpering.                

>> Dusty Feldhaus, he           
was hit at least                

           five times.          

 >> ...and he was apologizing as
      if, you know, he had      

something to, to apologize for. 
I mean, naw, don't...           

  you know, "I'm sorry." What   
  are you sorry for?            

  So... you're a freaking hero. 
          We love you.          

          >> Yep. Yeah.         

         >> We miss you.        

Bryan Burgess: My               
daughter is Makayah.            

She turns four next month. My,  
my son                          

is Xander. He turns             
three in January.               

     >> Cool. You miss 'em?     

            >> I do.            

          >> How much?          

            >> A lot.           

     [dramatic music plays]     

     [singing indistinctly]     

  >> All right, Feldhaus, show  
  us how to fight.              

       [indistinct chatter      
          and laughter]         

        >> They're dying.       

  And they're fighting, not for 
       some war on terror.      

      They're fighting for      
         their buddies.         

   Mike: What kept you going?   

   >> The rest of these guys.   

 >> We all kind of saw it in us 
 to, to, to try to              

  be strong, if, if not for us, 
             for, at            

      least, you know, the      
         guy beside us.         

 >> I stayed there, even though,
           I should...          

 my, my instinct was to get the 
       hell out of there,       

  but I stayed there for all my 
       guys, my squad, my,      

    my platoon, stayed there    
        for the bastards.       

 >> They're sacrifices are not  
 going to be forgotten.         

    >> Got, um, hoisted out,    
          and that was,         

       that was good, all       
         three of them.         

        Continue getting        
  [unintelligible] to traffic.  

    We found a bunch of enemy   
   weapons, enemy I.D.s, so...  

    found the radio station.    

       [aircraft overhead]      

>> John, what, what are you     
cooking there, dude?            

           [sizzling]           

>> Um, I'm cooking up, uh,      
paratha.                        

 [speaking arabic in background]

        >> What? Paratha?

 >> Hoosa had one whole bread,  
 man.

out of your mind                
and keep going,                 

and keep moving on              
for the guys,                   

so they don't, uh, they         
don't get all                   

tripped out and stuff, so...    
just keep going.

    Go back to your mama. Go

just made him, like, reject it.

        I've done it for        

  twenty-two years. I've just,  
    I've enjoyed it, and I've

      [helicopter whirring]

      huge difference here,     

       that we reduced the      
      insurgent credibility     

     here. We went right in     
     their back yard,           

 right in their home town, and, 
         and succeeded.         

      >> It's hard to tell      
      families that their       

     sacrifice quantifiably     
       made a difference,       

       'cause they're ten       
      thousand miles away,      

      and you're trying to      
      explain that to 'em,

       their father, their

     best carry their memory    

   forward, and ensure their    
   sacrifice is for a greater   

 good, and that we'll never let 
       their memory fade.       

   >> It was hard. I knew all   
         of them, and as        

  a task force commander, it's  
      very difficult to, to     

 know that the orders you gave  
 for combat cost us.

        Ofren Arrechaga.        

   >> He was the rock for the   
   platoon. He was the,         

  uh, humor. He was always the, 
            the happy           

      guy. He always had a      
       smile on his face.       

      >> These bonds are so     
          close that...         

     you're not gonna leave     
     somebody out there to      

 get shot or die by themselves. 
 You're                         

       gonna run out there      
         and help them,         

         no matter what.        

        >> Staff Sergeant

     Staff Sergeant Frank E.    
            Adamski.            

    >> Sergeant Adamski was a   
        husband, father,        

       a squad leader, and      
         my best friend.        

        >> Staff Sergeant       
         Bryan Burgess.         

     Staff Sergeant Bryan A.    
            Burgess.            

   >> The last thing Sergeant   
         Burgess said to        

    me was, uh, "Where's my     
    chariot?" He was            

 talking about the Medevac bird.

    About the sixty that was    
    hovering above us.          

      "Where's my chariot?"     

 And I said, "It's right here."

 Specialist Dustin J. Feldhaus. 

    >> We went through thick    
       and thin together,       

    and though I am sad that    
    he's gone, I'll             

  always cherish the memories   
  that I have shared with him.  

   I love you, Mouse. Rest in   
         peace, brother.        

   >> P.F.C, Jeremy Faulkner.   

   P.F.C. Jeremy P. Faulkner.   

   >> With such a famous last   
   name, I told him he should   

        live up to it. He       
        gave back to me,        

   and no kidding, he told me,  
             quote,             

"I'm gonna make history, sir,   
    not write about it."        

 >> You'll always be remembered,
               and              

    you'll always be loved by   
        all the bastards.       

      Rest in peace, Remy.

          [guns firing]         

>> It becomes, uh, to a point,  
  that it gets to be enough.    

         [yells command]        

   >> All these men, his men,   
              dead.             

      He didn't know the        
      camera was rolling.       

  He hung back the whole time.  
  When                          

   no one else was around, he   
        walked up, and he       

  let the tears of this entire  
   war come out, right there.   

    And I could do nothing...   

        but cry, myself.        

      [solemn music plays]      

      You sit down and you      
       come to grips with       

     your life. But you have    
         to realize that        

      what you've done is       
      something important.      

    And you hope you've left    
        something behind.       

    We only do this to make     
    a difference.               

    That's why you constantly   
        keep going back,        

  keep fighting, keep trying to 
       tell these stories.      

   Otherwise, my whole life's   
        been for nothing.       

    You know something? It's    
       been for something.      

             It has.            

     [uplifting music plays]    

>> I think I have an I.E.D.     
on you.                         

We'll have to dig and find out. 

             >>Dude.            

      [children chattering]     

           [laughter]           

  >> Is she still following me? 

             >> Yep.            

        [speaking arabic]       

  Good luck with that tractor.  

  >> Hey, buddy. How you doing? 

 High, high five. There you go! 

    Fist bump! No fist bump?    

             >> No.             

        >> Oh. I'm hurt.        

         [speaks arabic]        

     [makes whooshing sound]    

>> Mott, hold the tea cup up    
    and said, "America."        

          >> "America."         

           [laughter]           

       [rock music plays]       

         >> Yeah! Whoo!         

      [children chattering]     

 Mike: What do you miss most    
about home on Fourth of July?   

        >> Spending time        
         with my family.        

 But I have my new family here, 
      so I'll spend quality     

    time with my new family.    
          To everybody          

      back home, I miss you     
         and I love you.        

     >> What kind of message    
      would you wanna give      

   Americans about what you've  
        been doing here,        

   and on this Fourth of July?  

 >> I'd say, uh, to support the 
 troops. It's, uh, it's         

  pretty tough, being out here. 

>> We're so blessed with what   
 we have back in the States,    

    and I just hope everyone    
    remembers that back home.   

>> Puts a different perspective 
on what it means to             
be American.
