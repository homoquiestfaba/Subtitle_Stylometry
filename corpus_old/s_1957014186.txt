EVAN: He moves
through this town unseen,

like a ghost,

and he kills at will every year.

The Blissfield Butcher started
his reign of terror in 1977,

and it continues to this day.

A geriatric serial killer?

Really?

Don't underestimate
a straight white man's

propensity for violence, Isaac.

I don't care
how fucking old they are.

(chuckling)
And your story...

it's bullshit, Evan.

The Butcher killed some kids,
like, in the '90s,

and then 20 years ago,
he disappeared.

The rest is just local folklore.

Yeah, but didn't the Butcher,
like, also kill

a bunch of kids at prom
way back when?

Not prom. Homecoming.

All the Blissfield Butcher
stories

are centered around homecoming.

And a new legend pops up
every year

during homecoming week
to warn Blissfield's teenagers

of the dangers
of "underage debauchery."

(sinister voice):
What will this year's story be?


(grunts loudly)

Oh, my God, Isaac!
(laughing)

I smell like cheap beer now.

Hey, there's some soda water
in the bar. That usually helps.

(door opens, closes)

(sighs)
(sets bottle down)

(door closes)

(chuckles softly)

â™ª â™ª

What is all this shit?

Ginny's dad's an art collector.

That's pretty cool.

Hmm.

(eerie voices whispering)


Wow.

The fuck's La Dola?

Hey, there's no way
to open this thing.

Are you gonna help me or not?

Uh, not with that attitude.



â™ª â™ª

(door creaking)

(steps creaking)

â™ª â™ª


Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

Mon...

Montra... Montrach...

Montrachet?

(door bangs shut)

Oh, shit.

(glass crunching)

Yeah, nice one, Sandra.
You made me drop it.

God.

God, they're gonna kill me.
(shards clinking)


This looks so expensive.

Damn it.

Y-You know, you could at least

come down and help me
clean this up.

(grunts, screams)

(muffled gagging)

"Not with that attitude." (scoffs)
(water running)

Whatever, Isaac.

(faucet squeaks, water stops)

(two slow knocks)

One moment, please.

(loud, rapid knocking)

Aggro-knocking won't
make me move any faster.

(loud bang at door)

â™ª â™ª


(panicked gasping)


(grunting, moaning)


Wait. What about me?

You're taking too long.

It's a vagina,
not an all-night drive-through.

Can we go three more minutes?
That's all I need.

You know,
that's really inconsiderate.

Yeah, 'cause guys are
always so considerate.

Maybe a handy?

(light clunks, whirs)


(body thuds)


(screams, pants)

Help!


(screams, whimpers)



â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

(shuddering breaths)

(whimpers softly)

(quiet creaking)

(soft, shuddering breaths)

â™ª â™ª

(car honks horn)
(gasps) Daddy.



(gasping weakly)

(eerie voices whispering)

(deep, distorted voices
speaking indistinctly)

(lock chirps)
(laughter)

MOM: Did you see the car
at the end of the driveway?

DAD: No.
MOM: I did.

She better not have boys over.

Oh, if she does,
I'm gonna fucking...

(both screaming)

MOM:
Oh, my God!

(both continue screaming)

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

(electronic squealing)

(squealing stops)

â™ª â™ª



CORAL:
Millie, breakfast!


Good morning.
Morning.

(gasps) It smells so good.
(food sizzling)

Banana pancakes,
Kessler family recipe.

MILLIE:
Mm.

I'll take mine to go.
Hey. No, no, no.

Come sit down.

Let's eat like a family
for a change.

Family. Right.

See? Isn't this nice?

It feels like we hardly ever
do this anymore

since your-your dad...

So, Millie,

do you have a date
for homecoming tomorrow?

I, um... I'm not...
I'm not going.

She has a date with me.

We're going to see <i>Wicked</i>
at the Anus Theater.

"Ann-is."

Wow.

What?

Nothing.

It just seems a little weird
to miss out

on a seminal
high school experience

to go see shit regional theater
with your mom.

Oh, I'm sorry. Aren't you
supposed to discourage her

from things like that?

You know it's just
underage drinking

and God knows what else
that can end in tragedy.

Oh, her night is still
ending in tragedy.

Charlene. (scoffs)

Yeah, I mean, you want to go.
You're excited, right, Millie?

Yeah. Of course.

(cell phone chimes, buzzes)

I got to go.
The sheriff says it's urgent.

â™ª â™ª


Mmm.

Pancakes are really good, Mom.

Oh. Thanks, honey.

(bell tolling)

(indistinct chatter)
(dog barking)

WOMAN (chuckles):
Keep up, ladies.

MAN:
Morning, Millie.

Hi, Mr. Daniels.


Hello. You're so cute.
(engine squeals, horn honks)

(pop music playing
over car stereo)

I love your black wiener,
Mr. Daniels.

(dog whimpers)

Joshua.

The dog is black, Nyla.

Let's go far.

Oh, my God.
(chuckling)

(engine chugs, squeals)

I-I couldn't.
Millie, you promised.

I know, but she made me
feel so bad.

Your mom's superpower is guilt.

Now you're gonna miss
the homecoming dance

to go watch some hag in
green face hanging from a wire?

Come on. Tit up.
(scoffs)

It's just a stupid dance.
Why do you want to go, anyway?

I have to shoot it for yearbook.

I'm in it for
the drunk straight boys

who will suddenly realize
they're fluid.

That sounds kind of rapey.
Good.

Have you seen what's
on the menu in this town?

(cell phone beeps)

NYLA: Is that the mailman?
MILLIE: Oh, my God.

(laughing)
Welcome to Tragicstan.

And hello.
(laughing): Oh, my...

Booker is gonna be at the dance.

This is your chance
to land that plane.

I'm not landing that plane
or any plane.

He hardly knows I exist.

Are you serious?
You're a fucking piece, girl.

Oh, I'm a piece?
Uh-huh.

Okay, barf choice of words
or not, Joshua's right.

You got it, Mill.
You just need to own it.

See?
Even Miss Word Police agrees.

You're going. That's final.

Hey, Mill, hold on a sec.

It's been a year.

You can't keep living your life
for someone else.

You've got to start
doing things for you.

Yeah, it's just...

It's not that easy.

My dad was her whole world.

I get it. I really do.

You don't want to hurt
your mom's feelings.

It's why I love you.

I just... I don't want you
to wake up one morning

and realize your whole life
passed you by

'cause you were busy
being everything

to everyone but you.

I'll see you at lunch, okay?

I love you.
I love you.

â™ª â™ª

(takes deep breath)

(indistinct chatter)
(lockers opening and closing)

(barking loudly)
(yells)

(laughs, whoops)

Millie, hi.

Hi, Ryler.

I love your dress.

Thanks.
Where'd you get it?

I... don't know.

I, um... I've had it
a long time.

I think I saw it
at Discount Bonanza.

I had to pee.
(laughing)

Did your mom use
her employee discount?

Anyway, you look adorbs,
seriously.

(girls laughing)

God.

â™ª â™ª

(sighs): Oh, my...
(school bell ringing)

(birds chirping)

And I did a common A-frame,

but with delicate detail
to the window framing.

Any dog would kill
to call this their home.

If you installed some speakers,

threw down a rug,
it'd be the ultimate pooch pad.

Sorry, M-Mr. Bernardi.

Late again, Miss Kessler.
It won't happen again.

I doubt that.
Just sit down.

It's very nice.

This woodwork is exceptional.
(sighs)

PHIL: Thanks, Mr. B.
(whispers): Hey.

Pro tip: always set your watch
five minutes ahead.

It saves my ass,
like, every time.

Thanks.

ChÃ¢teau Fido.

Come on.

Great work, Phil.

Once again,
setting the class standard.

Next up is...

oh, Millie Kessler.

Time to present your doghouse.

Uh, my presentation isn't
scheduled till next week.

This isn't debate class.

But you said the 16th.

Um, it's not ready yet.

Once again, Miss Kessler
is holding up the class.

And once again,
Miss Kessler is unprepared.

(loud bang)
(whispers): Dick.

Something to add, Booker?

Nope.

Can I just do it the 16th?

Can I just do it the 16th?

Speak up.

Oh, crocodile tear
doesn't excuse

your poor planning,
Miss Kessler.

(phones vibrating,
chiming, ringing)

(students murmuring)


â™ª â™ª

My God.

NYLA:
This is completely bonkers.

I'm in shock.

I just saw Sandra
two days ago in PE.

And now she's...
(door opens)

Oh, my God.
It's a slaughterhouse.

Are you smiling?

Everybody is freaking out.

Check it out.

Ginny was one of
my best friends. (crying)

Why?

Bitch, please.

Ginny hated Ryler

after she started that rumor
about Ginny getting a carrot

stuck in her pussy.
Don't say that word.

Whatever. Vagina.

Who would do something
like this?

The Blissfield Butcher.

He's just an urban legend.
He's not real.

Mm, four very dead teens.

It seems pretty real to me.

They're gonna have to
cancel homecoming.

Please.

Homecoming is like Christmas
around here.

They're not canceling it.

(crowd cheering)
â™ª Lights out â™ª

â™ª Follow the noise â™ª

â™ª Baby, keep on dancing
like you ain't got a choice â™ª

â™ª So come on... â™ª

Told ya.

CHEERLEADERS (chanting):
Hail, hail, Blissfield High!

Chomp, chomp, chomp,
our battle cry!

Yo, guys, check this,
check this.

When our Beavers come to fight,

feel our glory
and our might! (whooping)

Only beaver nobody would touch!

I mean, if you brown-bag
her face, she's sort of doable.


â™ª â™ª


MILLIE:
I smell like orange soda.

It's not that bad.

You should quit.
It is not worth it.

Extracurriculars look good
on applications.

As if your mom would ever
let you go away to college.

Hey.

She's late. Again.

You sure you don't want a ride?
Yeah.

Yeah, she'll be here. She
probably just stopped for gas.

You want us to wait with you?
Mm-mm.

There is a psycho roaming free.

(chuckles)
No.

I'm good. There's plenty
of people around.

And she'll be here any minute.

I'm good. Just go.

Okay.

(fingers snap)
(chuckles) Bye, Mill.

(laughs) Bye. Love you.
Bye-bye. Love you, poodle.

Thank you very much.

Love you.
Love you.

Bye.
Bye!

Goddamn it.

(phone chimes)

Shit.

(phone ringing)

Hi.
CHARLENE: She's passed out on the couch again.

Can you come get...?

You've got to be kidding me

(gasps softly)
Please don't be the Butcher.

Please don't be the Butcher.
Please don't be the Butcher.

My sister's gonna be here
any second!

She's a cop!

With a gun!

â™ª â™ª

Shit. (panting)





No!

No!

(Millie screams)

CHARLENE:
Get away from her!

Millie! Millie!

Oh, my God!

6542 to dispatch.

I need an ambulance
at my location ASAP!

Hey.
(indistinct radio chatter)

You're okay. You're okay.

It hurt him, too.
You're in shock. It's okay.

Help's coming, okay?
It hurt him, too.

It's okay. It's okay.
Help's coming.

Help's on the way.

You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

â™ª â™ª

CORAL (muffled, distant):
No, it-it wasn't my fault!

I know.
But I was just coming home.

I was gonna sleep until 4:30.

I was so tired.
I had one glass of wine.

CHARLENE: You did not have
one glass of wine!

No, you had an entire bottle
of wine to drink.

CORAL: It was one glass of wine!
Yeah, right.

Good. You're up.

How are you feeling?

Okay, then.

How's your shoulder?


Let's go get manicures
after work, huh?

Okay, then. Well, I'm gonna
give you a minute.

And, uh, I made French toast,
with your favorite:

caramelized bananas.

Okay.

Mill, come on.

Food's getting cold.

(inhales sharply)


Where am I?

Hello?

Oh, my God.
Why do I sound like that?

â™ª â™ª


What the fuck? Oh, Jesus.


Okay.
You are just hallucinating.

Hey! You got any jelly beans?
I'm sorry.

Do I have jelly beans?
You know, ice cubes.

Uh, crunch and munch.
You got some drugs, man?

Oh, my God.
No, I-I don't have any drugs.

I'm not a drug person.

Uh, may-may I ask you
a question?

What?
Yeah. Just, you know,

I'm just curious.
What do I look like?

Like, when you're seeing me
right now?

Do I look like a, um, you know,
do I look like a girl?

Girl?
Yeah.

You know, like, five-foot-five.
Very petite blond.

You're fu-fucking lying, man.

You, you, you got drugs.
You're high right now.

Oh, no, no.
I don't have the drugs.

Come on, man.
Give me some of those.

That's good stuff.
Please don't. Please don't.

I want to feel like
a teenage girl.

I want to feel like a girl.
I said... Help me!

Come on! Come back! Come back!

I'll suck your dick!

All of it!

(news theme plays)
(food sizzling)

REPORTER: I'm here just outside
Blissfield Valley High School,

where a teenage girl
was viciously attacked.

The survivor,
whose name is being withheld...

Oh, hey, sweetie.

I didn't see you there.

You're like a little ninja.

Come on.

Come on, I made you breakfast.

Sit, silly.

Come on.

Here you go.

I really want you
to try to eat, okay?


Got you some fresh pineapple.
(chopping loudly)

I know how much you love it.

It's a good juicy one, too.

â™ª â™ª

Oh.

(drops knife on counter)
(chuckles)

Mama forgot the syrup.

There you go.

Try to eat something, okay?

CORAL:
Mm.

Crispy, like you like it.

Mm.

Mm.

Oh. Oh, my word.

Yeah, okay. All right.
I guess you are hungry.

(doorbell rings)

Who on earth is...?

Hey, Mrs. K.

Hi, Frank.

I was gonna stick this
in your box,

but I-I figured
I better check on y'all.

Oh, okay.
Well, thank you.

How... how's Millie?

I heard.
It's just awful.

Well... (sighs)

I think she's
a little bit in shock,

but she's gonna be okay.

CHARLENE: Mom, this house
smells like a fucking Denny's.

Hey.

I thought you were
still sleeping.

Good morning?

Okay.

(pouring coffee)

I got it, sweetie.

Bye.
Have a good day, honey.

Be safe.
Thanks, Mom.

Okay.

Honey, I think you should go
and get some more rest.

You're not thinking of
going to school, are you?

School?

I mean, I know
your friends must be

worried about you, but...

Friends.

REPORTER (on TV):
The suspect, now identified as

Quentin Shermer, escaped
the Avondale Sanatorium,

a maximum-security facility
for the criminally insane.

Shermer, also known by locals
as the Blissfield Butcher,

murdered his mother
and infamously left

her severed head
outside a Dairy Queen in 1992.

Millie,

We love you.

Can you not, Ryler?
Piss off, Ryler.

This is not about you.

Fuck off.

of course that guy's a killer.

That gross, bloated,
sweaty face and brown teeth.

I mean, I don't think I've ever

What?

STUDENTS: What?! - (murmuring)

Miss Kessler.

I'm speaking to you,
Miss Kessler.

Stay safe, Beavers.

Hey.

Hey, how are you holding up?


(groans)
(drops tool)

(grunts softly)

Hot.

Goddamn it, Millie.

I am so sick of your constant
need for attention.

If only you would spend
a little less time flirting

and a little more time learning,

you might actually
make something out of yourself.

(students whispering)

Still nothing?

I don't think she's coming.

She's acting weird.

She was almost killed
last night, Ny.

Maybe we let her
be weird for a day.

I'm just worried about her.

Nyla, don't freak out.

(both scream)

Guys.
(panicked gasping)

Guys!

(Nyla and Josh shouting)
Guys, guys, listen.

It's not what you think.

Come on!

Balls.

I got balls.


He's still following us!

Guys!

You're Black! I'm gay!

We are so dead!

If I was,
would I drop my weapon?

I'm your friend.

Hitting's not okay, Josh.

Ow!

Just do it! Just take the...




Okay. Everyone's tired.

We've done lots of hitting.

(chuckling)

He stabbed me with this, like,
weird, old-looking dagger,

but when he stabbed me,
we both got hurt.

What do you mean?
(urine trickling)

Standing and peeing
is kind of rad.

Millie, focus.

Sorry? What?
(urine splattering on floor)

You both got hurt?
Oh. Yeah.

So, when-when he stabbed me,
he instantly got a wound, too,

but in the exact same spot,
the left shoulder.

And then, late last night,
I kept hearing

the dagger's name,
like, this weird,

like, whispering in my head:
"La Dola, La Dola."

I think the Dola caused this.

This is, like,
three gallons of pee.

This guy's bladder is huge.

Is everything huge?

Joshua.
Wha...

You know this is
the boys' room, right?

She's got a dick in her hand,
and you're wearing Chanel No. 5.

Think we're past labels.

(skin slapping)

This is ridiculous.

You guys got to see this.
This is like a floppy anteater.

JOSH:
This it?

Yes, that's it.

That's the dagger.

"La Dola,
an ancient Aztecan dagger

used in ritual sacrifice"?

Do I wipe?
There's writing on it.

I think it's Spanish.

I can't read it.

Aren't you in Spanish Three?
(pants zip)

And your point?

You should be able
to read Spanish.

Nobody pays attention
in that class.

Why don't we get
SeÃ±ora Cayenes to translate it?

CAYENES:
<i>Santa Madre de Dios.</i>

(speaking Spanish)

What does it say?

(continues in Spanish)

Uh...

<i>no comprendo.</i>

SeÃ±or Detmer,
you are in my class.

Well, I'm dyslexic.

I have a doctor's note.

<i>Ay, estÃºpidos niÃ±os gabachos.</i>

It says here, if the sacrifice
is not successful,

the souls of the two persons
are swapped

and the change becomes
<i>permanente</i> after 24 hours.

Permanent?

<i>SÃ­.</i>

Boys are so gross.


Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

I'm not a cock gobbler.

(banging on door)

Hurry up, loser.
I got to take a dump.

Uh, I-I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

I... I was... I was looking for,
for someone else. I...


How's that feel?

You like being scared?

No. I'm s... I'm sorry.
I di... I thought

it was gonna be...
(breathing heavily)

Please.


If you ever mess
with Millie Kessler

or any other kid again, I swear,

I'll make you wish your buggy,
wormy, stupid face

was never born. Do you got it?
(whimpers)


Oh, my God.
Did you just pee yourself?

Yes!
Ew!

That's disgusting.

So you're saying if I don't
stab him with the Dola

by midnight, I'm gonna be stuck
in this body forever?

Yep.
That's in, like, nine hours.

Uh, it's doable. Adjacent.

Where's the Dola?

It's at the police station
in the evidence locker.

Then we better get going
over there now.

Guys, he's here somewhere.

And he's wearing my body
and he's wearing my face.

He's like a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

And if we don't
capture him first,

God knows how many people
he's gonna kill.

What kind of a name is that?

Stupid name.

(door closes)

Miss Kessler.

You got some nerve
stepping back in this classroom.

â™ª â™ª

I'm not here for your games.

Turn that off!

(saw whirring loudly)

(yells)
No!

(both grunting)

(loud crack)
Ah! (groans)

(yells fiercely)

Self-defense.
I had to do it.

I'll see you
in the principal's office.

(saw continues whirring)




(both grunting)

(both panting)


That's what you get
for fucking with me, missy.

(yells)
Oh!




(yells fiercely)


(saw slowing)


Ma'am.

(indistinct
police radio chatter)

Fuck off, piggies.

JOSH: Is this where he is?
MILLIE: Yeah.

He'll be getting
out of woodshop.


Whoa. What am I wearing?

Stop right there.

Help! Help! Oh, my God!

It's the Blissfield Butcher!

Help me! Help!
OFFICER: Freeze!

Run!
BUTCHER: Please help!

It's him! (screaming)

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Where's the car?!

Run! - Hurry! Hurry!
(door locks chirp)

Go, go, go, go, go!
Get in the car!

(ignition sputtering)
NYLA: What's wrong with it?

It's a piece of shit!
What do you want from me?!

Uh, guys...

Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hurry! - (engine starts)

Go. Go. Go now.
Go, go!

(screams)
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Watch out!


(tires screeching)

Suspect-suspect spotted
in a shit heap!

Headed west from
the high school!

Why can't I just
have a normal life?!

Calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down, Nyla.

I just turned 18.
I could go to prison.

Nyla, can you scooch your seat
up just a little bit?

Okay, we need a plan.

They saw us with her,

so they're gonna be
looking for us now.

Ny, can you move up
a little more?

We need to get you
a disguise, Mill.

You can't be walking around in
those clothes with that face.

Everyone knows who you are.
Good plan.

Nyla, could you just do
just a little, teeny, teeny,

teeny, teeny,
just a little bit more?

You good, Mill?
Yeah. Much better.

MAN (over radio):
Suspect spotted with two youths.

Teenagers. One Black, female;
one white, eh, excited.

Heading towards
the northwest corner of town.

Hey, what the fuck? Are you kidding me?
(engine starts)

(siren wailing)
(grunts)

Shit.

NYLA: What?
It's the police.

(siren continues wailing)

Oh, my God.

It's Char.
Um...

Ooh! Up ahead, turn left.
We can mix into the parking lot.

No, no, no, no,
that's my mom's...

It's our best chance! Go!
Turn!

(tires screech)
(horn blares)

(truck horn blaring)

(Josh screaming)
NYLA: Holy shit!

(horn honking)
Come on!

(tires screeching)

MAN (over P.A.): Discount
Bonanza just wanted to welcome

all shoppers to our new...

Oh, my God. We're dead.

Come on.
We got to keep moving.

Oh.

â™ª â™ª

Shit.
Let's go.

Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

Millie, hide in here. Quick.

Do not come out
until we get you.

Look, come on.
Come on, come on.


WOMAN (over P.A.):
Ladieswear to register four.

Oh!
Oh! Oh!

Oh, I'm so sorry. I...
Sorry. So sorry.

I didn't know
anybody was in there.

So sorry.
No problem. Okay.

You all good in there?

Yeah, uh, uh, great, actually.

Thank you. Thank you.
Sure, sure.

Just, uh, trying on, uh, polos.

Wow.

I happen to be a professional
at helping men pick out polos.

What do you say?
Nope.

No, actually, I-I'm all good.
Don't be silly.

Everybody needs a second
opinion. How is the fit?

Because we have
lots of sizes here.

Oh, you know what?
It's so funny.

I bought my husband a pink polo
one year for Christmas,

and he about died.

"Pink?" He's so macho.

But guess what.
It looked great on him.

Brought out his eyes.

He had these... these blue eyes.

I bet he loved it.

I bet it was his favorite shirt.

He passed away a year ago.

Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

Listen to me.

Debbie Downer. I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to share
all that with you.

I just... You're just...
You're trying to buy a polo,

for God's sake. I...
No, no, no, no. No.

No, it's okay. It's okay.

I, um...

I lost somebody, too.

Really?
Yeah.

I lost my dad.
I'm so sorry.


You must miss him so much.

Yeah, I do.

Nothing prepares you
for this stuff, right?

I mean, we're all
just left here...

...to pick up the pieces and...

My oldest, she shut down.

She retreated into work.

And my other daughter, Millie,
she's so quiet now.

I can't figure out
what's going on inside her head.

Maybe she just needs
some... some space.

Just some time
to figure out who she is.

Yeah. (chuckles)

I guess I do smother her.

I-I don't mean to.

But I am scared.

She'll be graduating high school

and running off to college,
and then I'll be left here.

(Coral sighs)

All by myself.

But that-that's
never gonna happen.

She's your daughter, and...

...she loves you.

(chuckles)
Thank you for that.

You're so easy to talk to.

Yeah, you're great.
You're just...

Your voice,
it's so... comforting

and... very manly.

I know this is awkward,
uh, but... (stammers)

I've had such a good time
talking to you.

Yeah, it's been...
We hardly know each other.

I know, I know.
Yeah.

And I, I haven't even
seen you yet,

but I think we have
a connection, and...

I would like to know
if maybe you would like to

grab a-a coffee
with me sometime.

Ew. God, no.

No, I-I wouldn't, um...
I should never have asked you.

That was totally inappropriate.

And so what I'm saying is,

you know, um, "Oh, no."

Like, I've missed out
because we've had a connection.

You share so beautiful.

And I just would love to do
more than a coffee.

Um, even, even, have a dinner?

(chuckling): Oh. Dinner?
Yeah, I would love that,

'cause I-I feel like
we know each other so well.

You know what I mean? So it's like...
I feel that, too.

A coffee wouldn't be enough
for us. But I'm married.

Oh.
So I'm a married man.

Mom!
What?

Have you talked to Millie today?

CORAL: No, I haven't.
Okay. Where's your phone?

No, it's in my purse.
Go get it.

Call her
and make sure she's okay.

CORAL: I will!
The killer was just sighted again.

Go. Let's go. Come on.
G-Good luck to you!


What the hell is that?

NYLA: Quick, put it on.
You're scary Aaron Rodgers now.

Who?
Famous quarterback.

Green Bay Packers.
Even I know that.

You know I hate sports.

This is terrifying.
I can't breathe.

It's all we had time to grab.
Your sister's on our ass.

Let's go.
Come on.

I can't see shit.

How do killers do this?

Nyla, drive.

I'm trolling Insta.

Somebody's got to know where the Butcher is.
(grunts)

Got it.

Oh! Fuck!

Oh! Sorry.

Oh, that's your face. Okay.

Okay, I'm getting this off.

I can't see anything.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Stop, stop. If you get
recognized, we are screwed.

JOSH: Bingo.
Oh, my God. What?

Suffocating. Who's this one?
Mill.

Which one's who? Who's that?

Coming at you live,

Blissfield's unofficial
homecoming queen. (laughs)

(others cheering, laughing)

This sucks.

I want to party.
We should throw our own homecoming.

Fuck the Butcher.
Okay, sure.

And where are
we gonna pull that off

with Larkin's curfew?
The old mill.

No one would look there.

Hell yeah. That's genius.
Not bad.

Who knew little Millie Kessler
could be such a crafty beaver?

Your touch makes this pussy
drier than sandpaper,

you fucking monkey.


I can't wait to kill you.

She fucking wants me.

â™ª â™ª

I'm gonna take a piss.

Okay. Sure.

Okay, I'll go check the back.

Okay.

Oh, my God.

He's gonna kill him.
JOSH: What?

He's gonna kill him!
I literally can't understand you.

Here. Divide and survive.
You go that way.

â™ª â™ª

(roaring sound effect plays)

(cackling sound effect plays)

(bellowing laugh
sound effect plays)

Hey.

Hey, Millie.

Where'd you go?

Millie?

Booker?

Booker?

(screeching howl)
Oh!

F-Fucking...

(wailing sound effect plays)

(creaking sound effect plays)

(bellowing laugh)
Oh! (grunts)


I fucking hate this place.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, Millie?

Hey, where are you?

I just w... I just want to talk.

Make sure you're okay.

â™ª â™ª

(screams)
Booker!


Oh, my God.

Don't let him get away!

He'll call the cops!


Help! Help!


â™ª â™ª

Where the hell did you learn
how to do that?

Dad was an Eagle Scout.

Found these.

Ah.

Uh-huh.

Okay.


He's even gorgeous
when he's unconscious.

(scoffs)
(moaning)

Hey.

Jesus Chr...
Easy, easy, easy.

It's okay. It's okay.

Look, I know I look like
the Butcher, but it's Millie.

This is gonna sound really strange.
Booker.

Booker, look at me.
He's crazy.

Okay. Booker, can you
look at me, please?

Please. Booker, please.
Can you look at me?

Just for a second?

Okay, so last night, our
consciousness or our spirit,

whatever you want to call it...

Okay? It traded places.

She's telling the truth.
So, he stabbed me with the Dola,

which is, like,
this ancient mystical dagger.

(scoffs)
And now I have, like,

less than six hours
to swap back,

or I'm gonna be stuck
in his body forever.

You're all going
to jail for this.

You, too, Booker.

Unless you help me. Booker.

Dry up, bitch.

Booker, help! Booker!

Will you shut up?


Look, I know
this is crazy, okay?

And there's a lot
of voices competing.

You-you see my friends,
you know Nyla and Josh,

and they're on my side, okay?
And this is clearly not me.

Have you ever seen me
dressed like that?

I mean, I kind of like
a-a lot of what he's doing

with it, but i-it's... The point
is that you've never seen me

dressed like that, right?
Do you like that?

It doesn't matter.
Like, look,

I'm giving you
a lot of information,

and you literally just woke up.

Whew. You look great.

I-I got to get out of here.
Booker. Booker, please.

Please. Please, Booker.
No, I need to go right now.

You're not gonna stop me.
I'm gonna freak out, okay?!

"I'm not yours,

"not lost in you.

"Not lost,
although I long to be.

"Lost as a candle lit at noon.

"Lost as a snowflake in the sea.

"You love me, and I find you

"still a spirit,
beautiful and bright.

"Yet I am, who long to be

"lost as light is lost in light.

"Plunge me deep into love.

"Put away my senses.

"Leave me deaf and blind,

"swept by the tempest
of your love...

"...a taper...

in the rushing wind."

How?

I told you it was a curse.

Um...

What the hell was that?

A few weeks ago,
I found a poem in my locker.

It was anonymous.

I don't know why I did it.

I just was...

You know, it was...

It was just stupid.

(Butcher laughs)

BUTCHER:
You sad fucking cunt.

A poem in his locker?

You pathetic coward.

(muffled grunt, cough)

That's quite enough of that.

This should be his new mug shot.

Mm. (giggles)

Stop messing around.


NYLA: So the Dola's here
at the station.

We're gonna have to figure out
how to steal it

and then get it back here.

That's, like,
40 minutes round-trip.

There's plenty of time, right?

Uh, that's assuming there's someone at the station.
Hmm.

I mean, with them looking for us
and the party tonight,

the cops could have their hands full.
Hmm.

W-Where's the party?
It's at the old mill.

That's where I woke up
in this body.

He's luring them there.
That's a trap.

Then we better get moving.
And what about her?

Pronouns.
Christ, what about him?

(muffled grunting)
JOSH: My mom's out of town until Monday.

Yeah. No, I don't think
it's a good idea

to leave him here alone.
No, he's right.

Someone needs to stay behind
and keep an eye on him

just in case.
Mm-hmm.

What? Me?
It's your house.

Definitely gonna die this time.

Chill out. You'll be fine.

Wait. Wait, guys.


Leave me alone
with Murder Barbie.

â™ª â™ª

Okay, guys. He's gone.

That's Char's car.
You guys stay here.

Honk the horn twice
if you see anything, okay?

What's your plan?

Don't worry about it.

I got this. Yeah.

I've never been so stressed
and excited

at the same time in my life.

Hashtag "stress-cited."

Hashtag "nerves of steel."

Hashtag "What's she doing?"

Oh, my God.
Char, help me!

Nyla. What the hell is going on?

You were spotted
with the Butcher.

He-he kidnapped us.
He made us drive him. I...

I escaped,
but he followed me here.

Wait. He's here?
Outside, behind the station.

Okay, okay.
Just, just s-stay here, okay?

Hide under my desk. Go! Go, go, go!
Okay.

(door opens, closes)

That's so crazy.

But, you know, I have to admit,
in a really strange way,

that it hasn't been all bad.

What do you mean?
I don't know.

It's just, you know,

I felt oddly empowered
being in this body.

Like, invincible
or kind of badass.

(laughs)
I know.

It's, um... I mean,
it's ridiculous, but, uh...

I guess when you're, uh...

when you're someone
like me and you...

you know, you've been bullied
most of your life

and, you know, sort of just
put down a lot, that...

you know, it-it-it does
feel kind of good

to... just feel strong for once.

(laughs softly)

Strength doesn't come from size.

It doesn't.
It comes from up here.

And in there.

And you are a lot stronger
than you think.

(over TV): Hello.
Oh, whoa! Oh!

Oh! Oh!

(women shrieking,
clamoring over TV)

CINDY: Oh, my God.
JILL: What happened?

CINDY: Luann, are you okay?
ALEX: This one's a live one.

LUANN: I know. Hold on.
ALEX: Are you okay?

That nasty stare
does not scare me.

LUANN: He just started
trying to buck me off.

(piano music plays over TV)

MRS. DETMER: Hello!

(drops keys)

Joshy!

(muffled shouting)

Josh!

Hi, Mom.
(muffled sobbing)

You're home early.

My last flight got canceled.

Honey, why is Millie
tied to my dining chair?

Um... She...

We, um... role-play.

Mm?
I'm sorry?

We're role-playing.
Role-playing?

Yes, role-playing.

Like a game?

Sort of.
(muffled grunt)

She doesn't look like
she's enjoying herself.

(muffled grunt)
Oh.

Oh, um, that,
th-that's the point.

She's, she's supposed
to act upset.

Right, Millie?

(muffled sobbing)
She's method.

Never breaks character.

Naughty girl!
(exhales)

(women shrieking over TV)
JILL: He's eating my bracelet!

MRS. DETMER:
I'm a little confused.

(turns TV off)
Isn't role-playing

a sex game?

Is it?
Mm-hmm.

Yes. Yes, it is.

Mm-hmm. Yep.

So...
Okay, um,

Mom, I-I didn't want to tell you
until I was ready, but...

...I'm straight.

(muffled laughing)

Joshua, you are many things,
but straight isn't one of them.

Now do me a favor and untie her.

I can't.
Joshua!

Mom, I'm sorry.
(sobs)

I-I can't explain right now,
but I cannot let him go.

"Him"?
No! Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom, listen to me.

He's the Blissfield Butcher!

MRS. DETMER:
God! Joshua Michael Detmer,

I've been slinging peanuts
to assholes all week.

I don't have time for this.
No. Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom, don't!

How did you even do this? Ow!

(screams)
Run!

(both screaming)

Go, go, go, go, go, go!
(screams, pants)

(both panting)

(both screaming)

No, no, no, no, no!
Go for the windows!

Make sure they're locked!
Okay! - (grunting)

(ringtone playing)

What?

Nyla! He's escaped!

What?

Body's fucking useless!

I couldn't find him.
Are you sure he followed you?

Yes, I'm sure he did.
I swear he...

He took us, and, and...
Nyla.

What the fuck is going on?

(ringtone playing)
Don't you dare answer that.

I can explain.

Nyla, this is serious.

Put your hands up.
Please, just let me explain.

Hands up! Now!

(ringtone continues)

I want you to slowly
set the weapon down.

Now kick it over to me.

Hey, do you mind
if I come back there?

Sure.
Yeah?

My God. (exhales)

Right. I felt so far away.

(Booker sighs)

Hmm.
So...

about that poem...
Oh, my gosh.

Please don't bring that up.
(laughing)

That was a total mistake.

That was a mistake?
(sighs)

What? You accidentally wrote it
and you were just

going by my locker, and
you tripped, and it fell in?

Yes, exactly.
That's what happened.

Well, I thought
it was beautiful.

The poem.

Probably read it, like,
a hundred times.

Really?

Yeah. I mean, once I got over

how creepy it was
finding it, yeah.


I'm kidding.

I actually kind of hoped
that it was your poem.

No, you didn't.

â™ª â™ª

Millie, I've liked you
since day one.

You don't have to say that.

I know I don't.
That's why I did.

How weird is it
that I kind of feel like

kissing you right now?

Technically...

you'd be kissing a mass murderer
with yellow teeth.

You're still Millie to me.

M-Maybe we should wait
for when my hand's

not bigger than your whole face.
Yeah. No, no, no.

That's okay. That's...
It's, it's whenever you want.

I'm not going anywhere.

Fuck!

Millie, where the fuck
have you been?

I have been calling you all day.
What?

I've been calling you, too.

That is not your sister.
Nyla, shut the fuck up.

Okay. (laughs)

What is going on here?

Millie, stay out of this.

I'm just trying to help.
I don't need your help, okay?

I'm just trying to help!
I don't need your fucking help.

Back the fuck up.

Char!

(grunts)
Run, Millie!

Get your hands up.
Hands up now!

Come on, Nyla.
Pick up the fucking phone!

(tires screeching)

Charlene. Charlene! Charlene!

Over here! Charlene!

Oh, my God!

Start walking towards the cell.

Come on!


Can you listen to me?

Now!

Nyla, don't you fucking move!

(keys jangle)

Get in.
Can you please listen to me?

Move!

Hey!

No!
I'm so sorry.

Oh, my God! No!
Char, I'm so sorry.

No!

You motherfucker! Get me out!
I really thought

your hamster could swim, and
I'm so sorry that Regal died.

But this is all gonna
make sense to you later on.

I got to run. I'm so sorry. I love you! Mwah!
Guys!

We gotta go! We can't let him get away!
Let's go, let's go!

Your plan's the fucking worst.

Are you okay?
Your sister's a shitty driver.

That's not Char! That's the
Butcher and he's got the Dola.

What?
Come on, guys. Let's go!

â™ª Baby, you could be
the death of me â™ª

â™ª Maybe I'm crazy â™ª

â™ª I know you're danger â™ª

â™ª Baby, you could be
the death of me â™ª

â™ª I'm falling, fading â™ª

â™ª I'm seeing angels â™ª

â™ª Baby, you could be... â™ª

Yo-ho-ho, Millie Vanilli!

Where's my boy Booker?

Thought you guys were together.

Okay.

(lively chatter)
(dance music continues)

â™ª â™ª

So you think
you're this hot shit now, huh?

You know, I've never made
anyone's pussy dry.

I mean, look at me.

Oh, now you like it.

All right, come on.

â™ª â™ª

NYLA:
Wait, wait.

Looks clear. Let's go.

You guys stay here.

This is way too dangerous.

There is no way
we're not helping you, Mill.

We're in this together.

13 minutes left.

Or you're the Butcher forever.
(sighs)

Hey, come here,
give me your wrist.

Let me set a timer.
(watch beeps)

Oh, okay.


â™ª â™ª

Time to stab this asshole.

(dance music playing
in distance)

Well, what do you know?
Looks like we got

a little private party
going here, huh? (laughs)

Uh, are you good
at math, Millie?

'Cause the way I see it,

you have three holes,
and it all adds up.


Mm, will make it easier.

There we go. (chuckles)

What the fuck?

(Butcher shouts)


(Butcher yells)

(both grunting)

What the fuck did you do to
my friends, you fucking bitch?!

What are you doing?

(pulls starting cord)

(chain saw starts)
Whoa, whoa, look. Hey, whoa, whoa.

(chain saw revving)

What are you doing? Stop.
No, no, no.

Don't.

Please. I'm sorry.

Please, please,
please, please, no.

I'm sorry!

Look, I'm sorry!

I'm sorry! Please!

Shit, it's packed.

We'll search in pairs.
Text if you see him.

Do not try and be a hero.

Be careful, Mill.
You, too.

(dance music playing)
(lively chatter)

PHIL:
Hey, hey, hey.

What's up?
Have you seen Millie?

Uh, Millie, Millie.

Millie.

Oh, yeah.
I, uh... I saw her.

Really? Wh-Where?
Uh, this way.

Come on. Come on.

Come on.

(breathing heavily)

I'm not gonna make it.

Hey, don't say that.
There's still time.

Sh...

Oh, my God.

(dance music playing)

Hey, hey! He's here!
He killed Brett and the others.

What?! Wh-Where's Millie?
Uh, she went to find Joshua.

Oh, shit.


Where is she?

Y-You said you knew
where she was.

She's somewhere.

Millie, Millie.

Millie, Millie, Millie.

Millie, Millie.

Phil, I-I don't
have time for this.

Where...?


Loser faggot.

Wow! So self-aware. Bravo.

You tell anybody,
I'll fucking kill you.

(both screaming)

â™ª â™ª


Josh!


Get out of here.
No!

What are you doing?
Go!

I want my body back.

Come and get it.

Hey. Hey. We found him!

He's gonna kill Millie!
Right, go help her.

I'll slow them down.
Stop right there!

Come on.

(gunshot)
(all screaming)

(screaming in distance)

(both grunting)

(yelling fiercely)

Stop!
I'm trying to stab myself!

Drop the knife!
Shoot him!

(bullet ricochets)
(knife clatters on ground)

Come back with my fucking body!

â™ª â™ª


(both grunting)

Catch!

Hold him down.


(watch chiming)

â™ª â™ª


(Butcher laughing)


You're too late.


(laugh echoing)

Wait.

Where's the bell?
What?

The bell.
Uh, it didn't toll.

â™ª â™ª

Pro tip.

Always set your watch
five minutes ahead.

Saves my ass, like, every time.

Hold him down.

No! No! No! No!

(deep, distorted voices
clamoring)

(Butcher screams)
(thunder crashes)

(Butcher yells)
(voices roaring)

(gasps)
(panting)

Millie?

Who's your favorite athlete?

OFFICER: They're over there!
Hey!

No one. I hate sports.

Freeze!

Shoot that motherfucker!

(body thuds)

â™ª â™ª

(bell tolling in distance)

(Nyla panting)

(Josh chuckles)

(siren wailing)
(urgent chatter)

Um, what the fuck just happened?

That's real.


â™ª â™ª

BOOKER:
Hey.

Sorry to interrupt.

Time to land that plane, girl.
(chuckles)

Hi.

How's the shoulder?

Honestly, the best pain
I've ever felt.


So, what are you gonna
tell the cops?

A version of the truth, I guess.

Let's just hope
nobody ever gets their hands

on that thing again.

What?

So... (sniffles)

that thing...

we were trying to do earlier.

Oh. Oh!

Oh, are we, are we ready
to try that again?

I don't know.
Let's see. Let's...

That's much better.

Mm.
(chuckles)

â™ª â™ª

(Josh and Nyla whooping)

NYLA:
Yeah, Mill!

(both laugh softly)

CORAL: Millie!
(gasps softly)

Mom?
Oh.

Oh, Millie, you're okay.
I was so worried.

â™ª â™ª

(siren wailing)

(monitor beeping steadily)

His pulse
and heart rate are weak.

I don't think
he's gonna make it.

Good.

How empathetic.

If you'd seen the carnage,
you'd be glad, too.

(monitor flatlines)

Looks like you got your wish.

(knock on door)

I'm tired.
I'm gonna hit the sack.

Good night, Char.

Hey.

I love you, sis.

I love you, too... stinker.


Good night, Mom.

Good night, Charlene.

So, that application
to Boston...

I want you to go.

It's okay.
I don't need to go.

You're my daughter.

Nothing will ever change that.

Live your life, Millie.

(Coral chuckles softly)

Thanks, Mom.

(door creaks)

â™ª â™ª


You left the door open again.

(floor creaks)

Char?

(soft clacking)

Hello?

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

(thump)
(gasps)

â™ª â™ª

(panting softly)

â™ª â™ª




What's the matter, Millie?

You got what you wanted, right?

You got your body back.

Why aren't you happy?

Freeze!

(gun clicks)

Little girls
shouldn't play with guns.

(Coral yells)

(Charlene yells)

Run, Millie! Run!

(grunts, choking)

(gun clatters on floor)
(grunting)

(footstep crunches in glass)


Well, don't stop.

Keep coming.

(cries out)


I've been in your body.

I understand
why you feel so weak.


Why you feel so meager.

And all that anxiety
that you got.

Clinging to your dead dad.

You're really just
a lesser version of her.

And having to take
all those orders from

some drunk mom.
Ah! God! Ah!

That's not a life.

But it's all right.

(laughs softly)

It's okay.

We'll fix it.

(Millie groans, coughs)

You know...


I learned something
when I was in your body, too.

What's that?

Having balls sucks.

CORAL:
Take my hand!

Millie!

(Millie yells)
(Coral gasps)

(Butcher grunting weakly)

â™ª â™ª


Damn, Mill.

I <i>am</i> a fucking piece.
