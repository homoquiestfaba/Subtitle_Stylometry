Oh, boy!

My first party ever...

and it's the best party

in the world!

This jackfest?

But this is

the "peace feast,"
celebrating

the end of hostilities

between Titan and Mars!

It's the most important

social event of...

step aside,
talking brochure.

Just looking for

a cocktail waitress.

And by cock
I mean mine,

and by "tail"
I mean hers.

Would you like a mojito?

Great.

Whoa whoa, whoa whoa!

I didn't say leave.

That Gibbs fellow

gives me the hives.

What is he planning?

Yes, well at least

he has a plan,

which is more
than I can say

for Titan Force Five.

Don't worry!

Let's just say
a little bird

told me that
Titan Force Five

has everything
under control!

Wink.

Winking.

Wink.

And for you.

Oh, look,
that little boy

from the
make-a-wish foundation

thinks he's one of us!

How cute!

So I told the duchess,

"forget the soup spoon.

You could use
a good forking."


Your boy's
quite a celebrity,

Hammerschmiddtt.

He flies
combat fighters like

Chuck Yeager
with bees

on his balls...
and having

the Hammerschmiddtt
good looks

doesn't hurt him any.

Good looks must skip

a generation.

You should meet him,
now that

he's not
blowing up your

warships for a living.

Troy!

Meet Admiral Bitchface.

Sir.

The heir to Hammerschmiddtt

motors!
I'm honored.

Oh, no.

My son is a
crack pilot,

but he has the
business acumen

of a squirrel.

That's why
my daughter

Tiffany
will be taking over.

Enjoy sitting at a desk

the rest of your life, sis!

I'll be too busy

french kissing...

adventure itself!

Good thing
you've gotten

plenty of practice...

french kissing your dad's

butthole.

Sasha Caylo.

Troy Hamburgerschmiddtt.

Still flying
around in that

tap dancing
rust bucket?

Still using
dandruff shampoo

on your scrote?

If you'll excuse me.

This is my song.

* [tango] *

[gasp!]

Oh, yeah...
it's my song too!

Ooh! Ooh!

This is the way

you work a room, Sasha!

Go Sasha!

Your eyes
are on my ass!

Your eyes
are on my face!

Ooh ooh!

WOMAN:
I don't approve

of that.

Oh my God!

Is Titan Force Five
really here?

Well, a little bird told...

make your bird say where

Palmer is!

Haha, ladies.

You know, this doesn't

come naturally.

It takes thousands

of butterfly presses

for pec
control like this!

Who's next?


Move!!

Enjoy the
spotlight while you

can,
Hummersplirt.

When I catch Gibbs,

you'll be
yesterday's fishwrap.

Catch him?

He's kicking
your ass so bad,

the only way
you'll catch him

is if he literally gets

his foot caught
in your rectum.

Is that your nose hair

or have you been
snorting pubes?

Oh!

And let me tell you, VD

spreads fast
on a submarine...

cocktail wiener?

Um, no thanks...

Oh!

Perhaps you'd like a...

whore d'oeuvre?

Uh,
what the hell did you

just say to
my daughter?

Your daughter?

Well, I think
its safe to say

Sasha belongs
to the people.

At least the fun parts.

Uh, we've got a faulty

service robot up here...

Ow!

[Crowd gasps]

Gibbs!

What the hell
do you want?

I'm here to salute you,

Admiral!

A-bam!!

You can't
beat four aces.

Dammit, Gibbs...!

Lookin' good, Jojo!

You got any fries

to go with
that shake?

What shake?

This one.

[Rumbling, crowd screams]

Aw, certain
doom sure does

suck, doesn't it?

It does!

It does suck!

You have one
chance to avoid

agonizing death and

dismemberment,

but you'll
have to listen to

every word...

looks like it's
Gibbs zero,

Titan Force... Five.

Congratulations,
dip shit.

He's killed us all.

We've been
torn away from

the docking structure!

There's no escape!

So let me
get this straight,

you all
choose death?

Weird.

Just tell us
what you want.

Okay.

You remember
as a kid,

Christmas morning,
how you'd get

some
super-awesome toy?

You'd be dying to play with it

but Santa
forgot to give you

double-A batteries?

Oh,
I hated that!

Well,
that is how I feel

right now!

Because
I've got a new toy,

and it is
the coolest!

I've just stolen a cubic ton

of hyper-atomic
martian fuel!

That's a
Hammerschmiddtt

product, Gibbs.

The fuel's
inactive without

a molecular trigger-code.

In other words,

my double-A batteries.

So here's my proposal...

and there's

my counterproposal.

Zing!

My proposal is...

denied.

My propos...

foot got your tongue?

It's a play
on words.

Dammit, Palmer!

Give me
the codes or die!

Jeez!

Here's a toast...

to your face!

Mars
doesn't negotiate

with terrorists!

Oh, okay.

Well, I guess
I lose, then.

Oh, wait!

You've all
got about, oh,

five minutes

before you're
sucking down

a lava slurpee.

Oh, my goodness!

Codes or death, people.

My God, man,
where do you

store your nukes,
in a pagoda

guarded by
stuffed animals?

Oh, are we sharing

a blame pizza?

There's enough
slices for

everyone,
considering Gibbs

<i>is your rogue agent!</i>

Gentlemen,
gentlemen...

fine, fine, just relax,

I've got the
codes right here.

Prime Minister, no!

We're Martians, sir!

We'll die before
we bend over

for some terrorist
rump-pumping!

Troy and his
boyfriend make

a good point, but you're

forgetting one thing...

Titan Force Five
kicks ass!


Oh no.

This one's
personal, team!

I am the sworn enemy

of all crabs!

Here, here!

You two are...

ridiculous.

Wait!

I can't get a lock!

This thing
has no crotch!

Repeat!

This thing
has no crotch!!!

Abort mission!

Abort mission!

Hope your balls like

the taste of lava.

Say,
are you sure we don't

deal with terrorists?

It's in our constitution.

In some
obscure subsection,

or...?

In the first paragraph.

Well, fuck.

Why don't
they just form

Titan Maximum?

Because, kids, they're led

by an egomaniacal
troglodyte

who will let you all die

in a fiery hell
before he shares

even one iota of glory.

Titan Force Five
is a team,

Gibbs.

And they'll beat
you as a team.

Make way for

the awesome train!

Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-

awesooommmme!

Palmer!

WILLIE: His armor is
too strong! [Straining]

Palmer!

Dammit, people!

Start acting
like a team!

As a team, I think

that we
should form...

my idea first!

Ooh!
They're forming

Titan Maximum!

It's breathtaking!

I guess we'll
all just take

your word for it, then.

[Over loudspeaker]

Attention crab!

Put down the
convention center!

Oh, you son of a bitch!

You're about
to get punched

the fuck out!

I... l'm blind!

My God,
it took my eyes!

It overloaded our visual

systems!

I'm recalibrating
the main...

"Eh-beh-beh-beh!"

God, I wish the
crab had taken

my ears.

Oh, my goodness!

We're doomed!

Woulda been
nice to see.

Okay, let's
re-evaluate here.

You're out of heroes,

out of time,

and generally boned.

So, who votes

for giving
me the codes?

Sorry, old boy.

Not happening.

Some things are worth

dying for.

I'll take that gallon of

molten magma
up my anus!

Now! Please.

You have your answer,
Gibbs.

And I hope you heard it

loud and clear.

Gibbs?

Prime Minister!

Five... ten...

and then a slash.

It might be
a backslash.

If one
doesn't work,

try the other.

Prime Minister, no!

What?
We voted!

Show of hands.

It was this
or the volcano,

you fool!

Eew, yeah.
About that.

It's actually
gonna be this

<i>and the volcano,
I'm afraid.</i>

So...

double-cross!

Enjoy!

WILLIE:
Systems back online!

It was a
one-in-a-million

chance,
but I managed to...

can we just
wrap this up?

We're talking
buttcrack sweat at

rainforest magnitude,
people!

Push!

Push as if
saving the day

and rubbing it in Troy

Hammerschmiddtt's
ugly-ass face

and lording
it over him for

the rest of his
worthless life

depended on it!

Titan Maximum
just might...

PALMER:
Push!

Puush!!

Brilliant, Troy!

Hey, it's what

Hammerschmiddtts do.

Push!

Uhh...

nothing's
pushing back.

Did we do that?

Noooooooooooooooooo!!!

Troy! Troy! Troy!

Me! Me! Me! Me!

Alright,
team effort, right?

Let Mars get
in on the act,

y'know, spirit

of the peace
feast and all.

Dumb bastard.

After you
belly-flopped

into the volcano
like a drunk

frat boy,
the Prime Minister

gave up the codes.

Thank God the
Hammerschmiddtt

kid stepped up.

Time for a career change,

Caylo!

Fighting evil...

not so much your thing!

<i>But we won!</i>

Not him!

Us! Me!

Virtue is its own reward,

Sasha.

Ow!

Ooh, ooh, excuse me.

A little bird tol' me that

you are
Titan Maximum.

Oh, did he?

Well that little
bird told me...

you're so hot...

and sexy.

Ooh, and you're
a good kisser.

[Thud!]

This is the
greatest night

of my life!

Timmy!

Good God,
what have they done

to my sweet,
transsexual Timmy?
