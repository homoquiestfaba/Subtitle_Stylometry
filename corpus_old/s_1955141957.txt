In the beginning.

At the earliest stages of life.

We teach our young that they
must prepare themselves

to live in the real world.

Yet there are rouges among us.

That can see beyond the walls of
concrete and steel.

Into a wild land of wonder.

But how does one
find this place?

[Brushing dirt]

What is that?

What did you find there,

Let me have a look at that.

Think I found a nug.

Bring it over here.

What is it?

What have you found,

Is that what I think it is?

Well, where you going?

[Small explosion]

[Muffled yelling]

I'm tired of your laziness.

You're worthless and weak

You do nothing, you are nothing.

You sit there all day and
stare at that picture.

What is so special
about that picture.

Get back to work.

[Digital sounds and

It appears Carl, a weather
anomaly this morning.

If you're driving on the Cedar
Sky Highway this morning

watch out and give a call
to Mountain FM

if you have information.

It appears that dirt is coming
down from the sky?

Yes Carl, I think it is dirt

nothing official from
environment Canada.

If you still have...

Â¶Â¶

Every so often an event
happens in nature

That is so profound

it belies the very
foundation of reality.

Â¶Â¶

This is the stuff of
legends and lore.

A rare phenomenon, that may only
happen once in a lifetime.

Â¶Â¶

In order to witness
such an event.

We must suspend our judgment of
what we think we know.

We must let go.

Look to the sky.

And believe.

Â¶Â¶

[Heavy clank]

Â¶Â¶

Yeah!

Â¶Â¶

Once you've seen over the wall

there is no going back.

Â¶Â¶

There is no unknowing of
what you now know.

You can not unsee, what
you have seen.

The doorway is open

Â¶Â¶

In the end each of us must
decide for ourselves

which form of reality we
choose to live in.

Will you be left behind.

Or will you set yourself free?

[Escalating crowd noise]

Â¶Â¶

Whoooo!

[Crashing rocks]


Â¶Â¶

So good

[Cheering and laughter]

Â¶Â¶

[Horse neighing]

Oh yeah baby

Â¶Â¶

Dropping!

Â¶Â¶

I keep calling this stuff dirt.

Put some more dirt here
in the belly.

Ah not dirt, it's just a
bunch of water.

It's at a certain temperature,
it's the weirdest thing.

I can't wrap my head around it.

Â¶Â¶

Â¶Â¶

Yeah!!

Â¶Â¶



Â¶Â¶

Thank goodness man

Â¶Â¶

Only have 8962...

Maybe it was 82692 days left.

Then I'm going to join you all
on that range.

I'm going to be out there.

And we're going to be
free together.

Â¶Â¶

Â¶Â¶

So happy it's over.

Â¶Â¶

Â¶Â¶

The hydraulic pistons stuck on
the bucket and the door.

As you can see here.

Doesn't want to let me go.

Â¶Â¶

Â¶Â¶

Â¶Â¶

The has arrived too.

This is the most random

It usually slides out on the
baggage carousel.

This time it got dropped in
by the helicopter.

Different

Pretty cool.

It's a new experience
for my bike bag.

[Cheering and laughter]

Â¶Â¶

That's some mountaineering
footwear right there.

Â¶Â¶

Goodness... where am I?

Â¶Â¶

Four's a good time for
snowmachines to not get
stuck in traffic.
