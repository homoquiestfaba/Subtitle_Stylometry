[Sam grunts]
You saw the witch and you survived.

Maybe that can help us.


The first day of camp.



<i>- my sister was dead.</i>
[thunder]

Only Cindy Berman would expect
to clean the outhouse and not get dirty.

Tommy!

Who are you?
Nick Goode. Nice to meet you.

Deep down, you feel it, don't you?

[Tommy grunting]

Shadyside, there's something cursing us.

to Shadysiders.

The witch is real.

And she's possessing people!

Tommy Slater!
[boy screams]


Mary... she tried to kill him.




"The curse will last

until body and hand unite."

We can save Shadyside.

We have to bury this thing...

right fucking now.

[body thuds]


Where is she? The body?
I don't know.

[menacing music playing]




We know where the body is,
so all we need is the hand.

Is it still buried under the Hanging Tree?


[boy shouting] Sarah!

Sarah Fier!

[indistinct whispering voice]




Sarah!

[animals bleating]

There's one more. It's breeched.

[pig grunting]


Hold her still.

I feel it. It's fighting to get out.

Tough little bastard.

I said hold her!

Sorry!


We're going to lose her.
We're going to lose both.

No, we aren't.

Don't go wobbly on me now, Henry.

On three, all right?
All right.

One...

two...

three.

[knife plunges]
[pig screams]


[piglets squealing]

And not a stillborn among them.

You have a gift, Sarah.

It's luck is all.

Luck and a very sharp knife.

This wicked one is going to Solomon.

He's lucky to have a friend like you.
Father...

What? He's struggled so.

First his child, then his wife.
He needs someone to take care of him.

Someone strong and capable.

I'm not marrying Solomon bloody Goode,
if that's what you're driving at.

I worry about you. Is it so wrong
for a father to wish his daughter to wed?

And leave you alone
to eat up all the bacon?

Not likely.

[bucolic folk music playing]
[chickens clucking]

[cow mooing]


[indistinct chattering]

A full moon rises before nightfall.

Good night to enjoy
the fruits of the land.


[Sarah] Alderman Goode.
Sarah.

A full moon rises before nightfall.

A good night to enjoy
the fruits of the land.

Try to clean yourself up before then.

[children singing]
<i>â™ª Pastor Miller, blind as a bat â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Pastor Miller, blind as a bat! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Tried to read the Bible
And his eyes went splat! â™ª</i>

Oh, but I see you.
I've got eyes in the back of my head!

[screaming]
[Pastor Miller laughs]

Don't be a brat, Constance!
Don't be a shrew, Abigail!

Sarah!

A full moon rises before nightfall.

Good night to enjoy fruits of the land.

I'm coming too!

No, you're not.

Then I'm telling Mother.

You tell Mother and I'll cut
your braids off your head.

Don't be getting us into trouble.
You know what Mother will do.

A full moon rises before nightfall.

Holy Hannah Miller?
Don't tell me you're going.

Oh, I'm going.

In fact, I'm going with Lizzie before
to get berries from the widow.

What?

Hannah, it's one thing for Lizzie
to trade with that hag.

It's another for the pastor's daughter.

Aren't you even a little curious?

I'll only go if you go.

Please?

Girl, what's taking so long?
I need help with...

Get inside.

[door bangs]
[man grunts]

I can see a secret about you, girl.

And a good day to you, Thomas.

Don't you want to hear it,

pretty girl?

Good girl.

I can see everything.

I see all the dark secrets in Union.

[Sarah scoffs]

You must be busy.

I see the darkness in you, girl!

Be still, Thomas!


Beware, Sarah Fier.


[up-tempo folk music playing]


Sarah.

[crow caws]


[piglet squealing]

It's too much. I can't accept it.


We're practically married.
Haven't you heard?

Well, in that case, tell your father
this isn't nearly worth it.

But thank you, truly.
[Sarah] Of course.

Shadows fall on us all now and then.

My, uh...

My brother wants me to give up.

Move back to the settlement.

He says the Goode family are not farmers.

But these lands, they are fertile.
I know it.

We'll have a healthy crop yet.

The sun will shine on us.


You look like death.

Sarah Fier, flattering as ever.


Well, I'm going to lose light.

I should go.

Full moon rises before nightfall.

Nothing good comes
from those woods after sundown.

You sound like my father.

So you're going?

Going where?

[suspenseful music playing]


Shouldn't you be sleeping?

Shouldn't <i>you </i>be sleeping?
Father wouldn't approve.

Then don't tell him.

the world beyond our own. Just one bite.

with that?


The widow's 1,000 years old.

She drinks the blood of virgins
to keep her youth.



She sacrificed her husband
to become the Devil's bride.

That's how she gained eternal life.

Well, I heard she kept the company
of the natives,

and that she even fell in love with one.

That's why she was exiled.

She learned their medicine too.
Solomon told me.

He took his wife to her
after they lost their child,

but it was too late.

Are you sure this is the right way?
How do <i>you </i>know where we're going?

I've been there before. Remember
when Abigail had her ring of fire?


She was scratching like a dog
during Father's sermon.

Mother told me she'd lain with a demon.

The Devil's gift.

More like Mad Thomas's gift.

Well, whoever she lay with,
Abbi made me go to the widow with her.

And the widow fixed her with witchcraft?
Yes, witchcraft.

And some foul-smelling paste
made for whores like Abbi Berman.

[dramatic music playing]

Are we sure about this?

[eerie music playing]

Widow Mary?

Widow Mary?

[fire crackling]
[crow cawing]

She's not here.

Find the berries.

[ominous music playing]


Abbadon...

Azazel...

Beelzebub...

Moloch.

Satan.




The veil has grown thin
with the turn of the moon.

And with it,

the Morning Star rises.

Beware the Devil. He lives in that book.

He calls to you from it.

He senses you now.

And if you're not careful,

he'll bore himself beneath your skin

and he'll consume you from the inside out.


Sarah?

Get out.

Get out.

Get out!

[widow shouting] Get out! You get out!
[crow squawking]


[folk music playing]
[laughter]


[girls yelling]

Full moon rises.

To the fruits of the land.


[up-tempo folk music playing]
[laughter]

[screams]
Come to the woods with me.

Entertain yourself with someone else.

[man grunts]
Get off of me! Stop!


Don't tease me, girl.



Sarah Fier, you want a kiss too?

You know, maybe if you weren't
such a frigid bitch...

[people gasping]
[Sarah] There's your kiss.

And if you're still so eager,

I'm sure there's a mule tied up
who will overlook your flaws in the dark.

[crowd laughing]

[girls giggling]



I'm just not afraid with you.

[both giggling]

We should go back.

Should we?


This is wrong.

Doesn't feel wrong.

[Sarah breathing heavily]

Tell me to stop and I shall.

[heavy breathing]

[breathing heavily]

[twig snaps]


[twig snaps]

[ominous music playing]


Someone saw us.

They couldn't.

What if it was the widow or Caleb?

Caleb can barely find his own member.

But if he saw us, if he tells...

That spoiled piglet doesn't scare me.

They'll hang us, Sarah.

Well, let them hang us then.

I was not alive before now anyway.

[Mad Thomas laughing]

Sinners, sinners.



[inhales deeply]

[exhales slowly]

[soft banging]


[dog barks]
[Sarah gasps]


Get in, you brute.

[eerie music playing]

[Henry] Sarah! It's half six.
[gasps]

You've overslept.
I've done most of the morning work.

All right. [sighs]

I'm coming.

[Sarah sighs]

[chuckles quietly]


Merryboy, time to eat!

Oh, where are you, dog?

Merryboy?

[suspenseful music playing]

Merryboy?
[Hannah] Sarah?


You scared me.

There's something wrong with my father.

Order's furnace beckons now.

To be freed, to be released.

What is he saying?

[indistinct whispering]

I don't know.


[whispering voice] <i>Cyrus...</i>

[fly buzzing]



He's distracted,

listening to things only he can hear.

Perhaps it is prayer?


No, something is...

wrong.

I look in his eyes and it's as if...

As if something crawled in from the night
and put on Father's skin.

It looks like him, but...

[whispering]
[Hannah] He's not himself, Sarah.

Mother's gone to the meeting house.

She says we must ask God,

but I don't know which Psalm,

what passage...

He needs proper medicine, Hannah.

I will talk to your mother.
No!

She can't know you were here.

I'm not to see you anymore.

[melancholic music playing]

Not to see me?

She suspects us, Sarah.

She suspects our...

wickedness.

And now Father is sick.

Do you think...

Did we cause it?


Everything will be all right.

[door bangs]

You! You!

You won't stop until you've
completely ruined her life, will you?

Mother!
You shut your mouth!

Thomas saw you last night in town!

He's telling everyone! How dare you
bring this filth into our home!

I see what you really are, girl.

An abomination corrupting my daughter.

Born of perversion!

Goody Miller, please!

[Sarah squeals]

God knows what you are, girl!

You'd better pray for mercy
on your damned soul!

[breathing heavily]

There something you want to tell me?


No.

I heard you come home late last night.

You were out
with the pastor's daughter, weren't you?

And Abbi.

And Lizzie and...

the others.


You know, it was your mother
who convinced us to settle this land.

She was wise enough to understand
this land was special.

<i>She said she could feel it in the air.</i>

<i>The lake.</i>

<i>The woods.</i>

<i>So we put down roots...</i>

<i>and made up our own Eden here.</i>

She was a good woman.

And I fear in her absence...

I have failed her.

I have failed you both.

Father...

There has always been
a strangeness in you, Sarah.

A streak...

Something perhaps
a mother could have rooted out,

but you were raised like a boy.

I gave you too much freedom,

and now it is too late.

It's my fault.


[flies buzzing]

[ominous music playing]

[flies buzzing]


[Henry shouts] Sarah!


[pig grunting]


She ate them.

She ate them all.

[pig grunting]

Bring me the ax, Henry.

Sarah...

The ax!

[dramatic music playing]

[pig grunting]

[pig squeals]


[sighs deeply]

[Mad Thomas] The dark one has come

to harvest the bitter fruit
of the evil we have sown.

To feast on our misdeeds.


[Mad Thomas] And yet you all smile,

blind to the horrors around us.

But you see it now, don't you?

He blocks our well,

clogs it with our sin.

[man 1] It's stuck!

He takes our water.
He takes our life blood!


What's going on here?
The bucket's caught on something.

[men grunting]

[man 2] It rises!
[man 1] Yeah. Let go.

It's coming!

It rises!

A dead dog in the well!


[man 1] Get it out!
Our water! It's poisoned!

from the cup of darkness.



This is the work of the Devil.
He has come to stake our land.

Who among you has welcomed
the Devil to Union?

Whose lust?

Whose sin?

Oh, foolish Union.

The Devil has come

and cast his darkness over us.

And his darkness grows

within each of us

like a rot.


[knocking on door]

[relieved sigh]

Solomon...

I didn't mean to stop by unexpected.

I have just a, uh...

a small thank you.

It's for Sarah.

What is it?

Can you keep a secret?

And that's when I saw
something in the trees.

A figure.

Who was it?

I don't know. It was so dark.

I thought it was Caleb or...

or the widow.

But now...

What?

Now we are tormented

and the pastor is sick and...

and I feel half mad, and now I wonder

if perhaps something is wrong with me.

Sarah...
And always has been, Solomon.

I was never normal. My own father said so.

Maybe I was born wicked

and strange.

Maybe it was the Devil in the woods.


Maybe the Devil is in me.

Stop! You sound like Mad Thomas.

Perhaps Thomas is right.

Thomas is a mindless drunk, nothing more.

Look around, Solomon.
There is blight everywhere.

I... I... I grant you that, but you...

Hannah was just a dalliance, Sarah.

And if it wasn't?

What do you mean?

That's why I'm so afraid.

Do you understand?

[Sarah gasps]

just a dalliance.

[melancholic music playing]

I see.

I can't breathe. [gasps]

Listen to me...

[Sarah breathes heavily]

Dalliance or not...

one does not summon the Devil by chance.

Even the weakest heart,

the most corruptible soul,

they must make the choice.

They must extend their hand,

which you did not do.

No.
No.

You can always come to me, Sarah.

My door is always open to you.

[girl screaming]

Cyrus! Come out!
[crowd shouting]

Constance! Where is Constance?

The Devil has locked himself in there!
[man 1] Pastor! Pastor!

Brother! What's happening?
The pastor.

He's locked the children
in the Meeting House. A dozen at least.

Henry! Where is Henry?

[indistinct yelling]

Solomon!

Cyrus!



[grunting]
[banging]

Keep everyone back.

Solomon, wait!

Let me in! No!

[man 2] Stay back.


[Pastor Miller mumbling] Because they are.
We call upon which they call within.

Resigned to deficit.

Where's my husband?
[man 3] Hold them back!

What's happening in there?

Let me go! Let me go! Cyrus!
Constance!

[Pastor Miller mumbling indistinctly]

[metal bang]

[metal bang]

[pastor mumbling]
[fly buzzing]


[metal banging]

[fly buzzing]


[banging faster]

[Pastor Miller] I can see now.

I can see everything.

[door crashes open]


Our children!

[crowd shouting]




[Sarah screams]

Henry!

[Sarah gasping]


Cyrus, no!


No!

Witchcraft! Witchcraft!

Evil! Show yourself!

Witchcraft!
[Thomas] Show yourself!


[ominous music playing]

[man 1] Hear ye! Hear ye!

Good people of Union, listen!

[banging pulpit]
There is a dark

and evil force at work here.

If we are ever to end this misery...

Aye!

...then we must root out the guilty.

We must...
[Solomon] Jakob! Please, Goodman Berman!

The man responsible is dead.

Pastor Miller...
[Jakob] The pastor...

Our pastor was a man of God.

[crowd] Right.
[Jakob] And this was not him!

He was possessed by a darkness.
[crowd] Yes!

My child, my dear Constance,
and many others...

are dead.

Our futures...
[crows cawing]

...many of our entire bloodlines
have been stolen from us.

Someone must pay!


I saw some little lambs of our town...

laughing, dallying on the full moon last!

[crowd shouting]

There were some of us in the woods,
but there was no...

We drank Apple Jack. We danced.

We are young. That is not a crime!

Heathens!

You have sinned! You have sinned!

Look upon your children!

For they will bear the Devil's mark!

[crowd shouting]


<i>- Witchcraft!</i>
[crowd shouting]


But just as my brother Solomon

heroically expelled the darkness among us

by killing our afflicted pastor,

we too will punish and surmount this evil!

Yes, we will!

As survivors, our faces always will remain
toward the sun.



This scourge centers on Union proper.


I've searched the woods.
It does not extend beyond the settlement.

[woman whispers] He's right.


We are being punished,
and I have a list of names!

Oh, then show it to us! Show it to us!

Enough! Enough!

Listen to yourselves!

Speculation!

Chasing shadows!

Imagined curses!

I ask...

do you have proof?

No. Or you?

Or any of you?

I have proof!

It was some nights back when the full moon
had risen just beside the sun.

<i>As I lay sleeping,</i>

<i>she came to me.</i>

<i>She witched me and led me to the woods.</i>

She was naked...


...and riding a red mule.

Yes.

[Hannah grunts]

[Caleb] <i>The red mule became a horned man.</i>
[laughter]

And she made me watch
as she lay with the Devil.

Who?
[man] Who was it?

As <i>both </i>of them lay with the Devil.

Both of them?


No!
No!

Witches! Witches!

Witches!
Witches!

[all shouting] Witches!

Witches! Witches!

I saw Hannah Miller and Sarah Fier.

I saw Hannah Miller.

I saw Hannah Miller.

I saw Hannah Miller.

I saw Sarah Fier.

I saw Sarah Fier.
I saw Sarah Fier.



Witches! The witches!

The witches!

[indistinct shouting]

We need to get away from here!
And go where?

Witches over here!

Go! Go!


disgusting whore!


Silence! Check her for marks!

No! No!

[Hannah grunts]


No! No!

Be still, witch!

[both grunting]

[man 1] Got one!

[Mad Thomas cackles]

we will purge Union

of this...

[man 2] Witch!

...wretched pollution!

[shouting, cheering]


every inch of wood!

We will not rest
and we will not have mercy!

[all shouting] No mercy!

we will be cleansed of these anathemas!

[all shouting] Yeah!
We will have our justice!

Yeah!

We will find Sarah Fier!


[man 3] Get up!

[man 4] Find her!

[man 5] Until we find Sarah Fier!

[man 5] Where are you, Sarah Fier?

[crowd shouting] Find the witch!


[dogs barking in distance]

[man 6 in distance] Find her!
[Sarah gasping]

Father!
My fault...

[George groans]
Father!

[door opens]

[breathing heavily]



[breathing heavily]

[twig snaps]

Did you hear that?
The other side of the house.


[man 7] Open up!

[loud knocking]

[loud knocking]

[door crashes open]

[indistinct shouting]


Take your musket round back
to the Fier house.

Keep an eye on George Fier.

Keep an eye out for that witch.

[indistinct shouting]


[stick rattles]

[door closes]

Hannah?

[chains clanging]

[breathing heavily]
What have they done to you?

I am to hang on the morrow.

And if you don't flee, you will too.



You need to run.

No, I won't leave you.
You must!

[Sarah sighs]
[chains clang]

This is my fault anyway.

No.
I led the Devil here.

That is not how it works.
You do not summon the Devil by chance.

You have to make a choice.

Don't you see?

It doesn't matter if we did it or not.

They think we're guilty, so we are.

[dramatic music playing]

You're right.

Everyone believes we've done it.

So what difference does it make
if we do now?

What are you saying?
I will go back to the widow.

I will make a deal with the Devil.

Perhaps that can save us.

But the Devil...

Are you mad?

I don't fear the Devil.

Hannah,

I fear the neighbor who would accuse me.

I fear the mother
that would let her daughter hang.

I fear Union.

They lead us like lambs to the slaughter
and expect us to just follow.

Well, they will see...

I am no lamb.

[man 8 shouting] <i>Sarah Fier! Come out!</i>

When this is over,
we will leave this place.

We will go far away

and we'll dance every night,

then kiss in the broad daylight.


I can't lose you.


If they want a witch...

I will give them a witch.

[bird cawing]
[insects buzzing]

[ominous music playing]


Mary!


[breathing heavily]

[crow squawks]
[Sarah gasps]

[breathing heavily]

[crow cawing]



[dramatic music playing]

[rapid knocking]

Away, Elijah.

[rapid knocking continues]

Elijah, I said enough!
Please, you have to help me!


We're innocent, Solomon.
I know...

Hannah and I, we didn't do this!

You're bleeding.
It doesn't matter. Listen to me.

I went back to the woods, to the widow.

Sarah!
She's dead, Solomon! Someone killed her!

And there was this...

this book...

with a... a kind of instruction,
an incantation.

An incantation? For what?
Yeah.


I think someone struck a deal
with the Devil.

Offering our town.

Our town?
[Sarah] Yes.

In exchange, perhaps, for power?

Solomon, I swear it...

it wasn't me!


Sarah...

I believe you.

Who else knows about this?

No one.


[Sarah gasps]

[Caleb] Solomon!
Go! Go quickly! Hide!



[loud knocking]

Open up, Solomon!


We're looking for Sarah Fier.

There's no one here but me.

Then we're free to search.


Do not try to intimidate me, Caleb.
I am not some child!

[man 1] Come out! Sarah!


Solomon.

What's in the back room, Solomon?

[Caleb grunts]

[breathing heavily]

[man 2] Sarah Fier!

[distant shouting] Sarah Fier!
Come out, Sarah Fier!


let me check.

What do you have to hide?


I'll tell you once more.
There's no one here, but me.

[man 3] Sarah Fier! Go around the back!
She's gotta be here somewhere!

or I'll make you leave.

Come on!

[Caleb grunts]


All of you, go on!

[Caleb shouts]

[ominous music playing]

Ahriman...

Azazel...

Bael...


You!

It's you!


<i>Samael...</i>

Lucifer...

Gorgon...

[demonic chanting]


Morning Star...

[ominous music intensifies]


It's you.

I'm still me.

I've always been me.

Only I've grown tired of watching fortune
turn a blind eye to me.

How could you?

How could I what? Take what we all want?

What we all came here for?

Power, prosperity, legacy.

Consider, Sarah...

a single soul...

Cyrus Miller.

Just one.

Pastor Miller.


what no amount of praying
could ever bring.

One person every few years
seems a small price to pay.

One person?

The pastor slew 12 children!

My brother! Innocents!
[Solomon] Innocents.

Who's innocent?

Your neighbors hunt you,

forsake you, curse your name!

Everywhere is ignorance!

Dread!

Yet you resign yourself to it!

They're afraid
because they know you're different.

And you are.

Someone who refuses to settle
for the rules of these dogmatists,

who seeks more from the world.

You're like me.

I am nothing like you!

[Solomon grunts]



[Sarah whimpers]
Argh!




[screams in pain]

Sarah!

Sarah!

Sarah!

Sarah?

Sarah!

Sarah, come back to me!

[flies buzzing]

[whispering voice] <i>Sarah...</i>

[flies buzzing]



Sarah!

Sarah!



[grunts in pain]

[Sarah panting]






No!

No! No, no, no, no!

[Solomon] Stop, stop, stop!
No!

[Solomon] Stop it!
No!

[Solomon] Stop it! Stop, stop, stop!
No, no!

Please, do not make me hurt you!
I love you, Sarah! I love you!

Stop fighting! I don't want to hurt...

[Solomon screams]


No!


[screaming in pain]

No! No!

No!

[Solomon grunts]

No, no!

[Sarah sobbing]
[crowd commotion]

[dramatic drumming]

[dramatic music playing]

[chains clanking]

for practicing witchcraft

is death by hanging!

[crowd shouting] Hang them!

Hang them!


Confess!

Confess your sins or burn in eternal hell.

[woman 1] Hang her!
[Elijah] Confess!

Confess!

Confess!

[man 2] Hang them!

[melancholic music playing]



No! No!

I confess!

No! She's lying!
I walked with the Devil!

I lay with him!

I bewitched the good pastor.

And I bewitched...

Hannah Miller.

[muffled screaming]

I clouded her mind.



It was me.

[muffled screaming]


It was only me.

[tragic music playing]

It was always me.

Hannah's innocent.
[Solomon] Let her go.

[crowd shouting]



The truth will come out.

Maybe not today...

and maybe not tomorrow,

but it will.

The truth shall be your curse.

It will follow you for eternity.

I will shadow you forever.

I will show them what you've done.

I will never...

let you go.

Hang her!
Hang her!

Witch!

Hang the witch!

[tragic music playing]


[tragic music intensifies]

[gasps, choking]

The truth will come out.

Maybe not today.

Maybe not tomorrow,

but it will.

bury her somewhere else.

So no one else knows where she is.


The truth shall be your curse.

[dramatic music playing]


[dramatic music intensifies]


And everything you take

and everyone you harm,

you will feel the grip

of my hand.

I will show them what you've done.

[dramatic music crescendos]

I will never let you go.

[Hannah sobbing]

[girl screams]

[open door beeping]

You OK?

Need help?

Uh... Uh, no, sir. I'm good over here.


What brings you back here?

Where's your sister?

Officer...

Huh?


[Deena grunting]

[both grunting]

What the hell?
[shushing]

It's him!


Your sister is very confused.

and his great grandpa!

What?

from some kind of a...

a breakdown.

She needs help.

Josh?

Goode is evil!

[branch snaps]

[tense music playing]

[rapid footsteps]

[dramatic music plays]

[tires screeching]

I was back in time. I was Sarah Fier,
and Sarah Fier was innocent.

She isn't turning people in Shadyside
into killers. She wasn't a witch!

<i>We have a 5150 in possession of car 961.</i>

<i>- Suspects on their way.</i>
Josh! Listen! Solomon Goode...

Who?

Nick Goode's Pilgrim ancestor

made a deal with the Devil, then framed
Sarah to cover his own Puritan ass.

Deena!

The Goodes, they're trading us.
People from Shadyside.


[Deena] <i>Goode gives a name to the Devil.</i>
Ryan Torres.

[Deena] <i>The Devil takes over that person.</i>
[whispering voice] <i>Ryan!</i>

What?

Then that person kills and murders.


of dead Shadysiders.</i>

And Goode gets whatever he wants.

<i>He becomes Sheriff.</i>

<i>His brother becomes mayor.</i>

All of Sunnyvale gets better and better.

And Shadyside doesn't.

And the Goodes do it over and over,
again and again.

<i>One Goode from every generation
passing down the evil.</i>

[Deena] <i>Solomon...</i>
Cyrus Miller.

[Deena] <i>Solomon's son.</i>
Isaac Milton.


William Barker.

[Deena] <i>Firstborn to firstborn.</i>
Harry Rooker.

Ruby Lane.

[screaming]
Thomas Slater.


Abbadon, Ahriman...
[Deena] <i>Right to Sheriff Nick Goode.</i>

So, Sarah Fier...
He framed her!

She's the only one
who's ever figured out the truth...

until us.

And the killers came after us
to keep us from uncovering it.

Yes, to protect Goode's deal
with the Devil.

But... but, Deena?

Yeah, Josh?

were after us before...</i>

<i>now that we know the truth,
now we know about Goode's deal...</i>

[flies buzzing]
[beating]

...what happens now?


[flies buzzing]


[grunting wildly]

[Sam grunting]

[Christine gasps]

Oh, Jesus Christ!

Look at her! I told you it wouldn't work!
There's no ending it.

[Deena breathes heavily]

What is it?

We need to talk.



for rescuing poor helpless Shadysider me!

Now.
Now.

[Sheila screams]




isn't always easy either.</i>

What if that's not who I want to be?

You believe me, right? About the curse?

Yeah, of course.

I've let a lot of people die...

Nick, this isn't your fault.
But not you. I'm not letting you die.




it's real.


<i>we have to kill him.</i>

We need to kill Nick Goode.

But I called him... I thought...

I thought he could help.

We need to go. Now!


[Deena grunts]

[Deena panting]

I wanted to do that all day.

Should be up here on the right.
Are we sure about this?

["Mo'murda" playing]
<i>â™ª Mo murda, mo murda, come again...</i> â™ª

[tires screeching]

<i>â™ª Mo murda, mo murda, come again... â™ª</i>

[police siren]

You gotta be kidding me.
Yo, man, I wasn't doing nothing.

Minding my business.


Urkel?
[Josh] Yeah!

Uh...

Wanna help us kill Sheriff Goode?

Let me get my coat.

lead custodial engineer,

I ensure that all retail establishments

come equipped with the StoreSafe 250.

This is the Cadillac of store gates.

Now, the 250 prevents
your standard smash-and-grab, graffiti,

all while complying with the 70%
visibility ordinance. Best part...

Easy to operate.

And we can rig them for quick release?

Little grease, these things go down faster
than a Sunnyvale cheerleader.


so the killers will go after Deena's blood
just like they did with Sam.

And then we use that to lure them
into the stores, and then...

Welcome to the clink, motherfucker.

The killers will be locked up,
then it's us versus Goode.

OK, sure, awesome, but then what?

Like how do we take out Goode?

Are y'all serious about this?

Once they're down, how quickly
can we get the gates back open?

[Martin] Depends, but...
Why would we want to do that?


<i>Carrie, </i>cool.

We'll <i>Carrie </i>him.


[dramatic music playing]

[imitating machine gun]

[Martin blows raspberry]

Seriously?

Look at this dumbass thing.
It's bigger than a tape deck.

If you want to hear more than one album,
you got to carry all that too.

It skips if you breathe on it.

Then listen to the radio, dude.
We have a situation here.

Yeah, about that, Urkel.
Um... what's really going on here?

OK. OK, OK. OK!

Cool. There's a half-possessed
tied-up white girl.

I need you to stay calm, alright?
I promise we got this all under control.

OK.
[Josh] She's one of them, we'll save her.

We're gonna kill Sheriff Goode
and save Shadyside.

[inhales deeply]

OK.

Any tips for fighting these things?


Try not to die.

[melancholic music playing]

[Ziggy] <i>Here?</i>
[Cindy] <i>Yes!</i>


Dig!

[digging]
[Cindy and Ziggy gasping]

Get ready to run.

[Ziggy] <i>No, Cindy, no! No, no!</i>
[Cindy] <i>Let's go!</i>

[Christine gasps]

This is it.

Yep.

[tragic music playing]

[crowd shouting]
Hang her! Hang her! Hang her!

[crowd shouting]

[whistling jovially]

[sighs]
What's that?

Never seen a goody bag?
All cops got 'em, for emergencies.

This one's Sheriff Goode's.

Full of useful stuff.
There was this one ti...

Somebody planted that.</i>

Those ain't my cans.

You're right, Martin.

These are actually my cans.

Son of a bitch.


I wanted to see if you wanted
one of these, uh... headlamps.

I know it looks pretty dumb, but...

It's perfect.

Up, up... down, down.

Left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

What?

It's the Konami Code.

It's what you need.

It's what we all need.

I have no idea what...

It's the ultimate secret code.

<i>Super Contra, Castlevania, Teenage Mutant...</i>

It's a code for extra lives.

When things get bad
at school or whatever, it's...

it's what I think about,

and it helps me...

I don't know, to survive.

You are the biggest nerd.

You smell like an androgynous baby.

Everyone says Shadyside sucks
because it's full of shitty people,

that bad things happen here
because we're bad,

that we deserve what we have coming.

That's how it was for Sarah,

and that's how it's been for us.

But it's all bullshit.

OK, just because we're weird

and smart and different

doesn't mean they can feed us
through their meat grinder.

Not anymore.

It's been three centuries.

No one else has gotten this far.

It stops here... tonight.

It stops with us.

We're gonna kill this motherfucker.

For Sarah,

for Kate and Simon.

For Cindy.

For all of us.

For Shadyside.
