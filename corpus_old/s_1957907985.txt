We can be here all night long
until you talk. I don't care.

Where are the bodies at?

Help us
and we can help you, okay?

It can be the difference
between a full life in prison

or the death penalty.

Joe, come on, just talk to us.

Where are the bodies?

Right now,
we only have five bodies.

All seem to have been dead
for about a week.

Oddly enough, there's not a single
drop of blood around the house.

I'm not sure if the victims
were killed somewhere else,

then brought here.

Jesus Christ.

Shit.

Hey, get this one right here.

Seems like death of suffocation.

Has anybody been
in the restroom yet?

I didn't see any bodies, but go
ahead and get pictures of all the rooms.

Seems there's something
in his mouth.

Jesus!

Stay here.

Ma'am.

Ma'am!

It's okay.
Where is he? Where is he?

Stay here!

Shit!

Fuck.
He has a hazmat suit on!

Everyone's hands up now!

Put your hands up now!

Take your head gear off!

Take it off!

Shit!

Fuck!

Fuck.

Can you hear me?

How's everything sounding?

Did you check the XLR cable?

Dave, you always got to check
the XLR cable, okay?

Yeah, the cable's fine. It was
just the levels. We're good.

Okay, do we need to do
a sound check?

Yeah.
Okay, uh, this is Beth Stewart.

We are in Houston, uh,
doing our final video project

at the absolute last second.

Uh, blah, blah, blah.

I'm tired, I'm hungry. I wanna go home.
Good.

All right.
Good?

Okay, um...

All right.
Take one. Action.

Are we like triple sure
that everything's going...

Yes. Go, go.

Hi, this is Beth Stewart
with South Vista College.

We're standing outside Houston,
Texas, which is said to have

one of the largest missing
persons' cases in the United States.

We are at the exact location where
a family went missing 20 years ago.

Jack Stern, his wife,
and their two children.

The only thing left behind
at the scene was their car.

Not a single drop
of blood was found.

That was good. Let's, uh, cut?

How was that?

It was good. I think all
we need now is B-roll, right?

Yeah, let's, let's wrap it up.

It's good. Let's go.

Let's go!

I don't know about this project.
It's kind of lame.

We can't just go to a spot
where people went missing.

Um, yes we can.
And that's what we're doing.

There's nothing lame
about a missing family.

It's like...

I don't know
if you've ever been...

...friends with somebody
that went missing,

but I think
it's an interesting story.

I wanna do something...

Oh, my God, I...

Val, I'm...

You... Uh...

You're such a loser, John.

He's so innocent.

Do you wanna do something scary?

Yeah. Unique and scary.

Okay, I have an idea, but let's
grab food, and then let's go...

I'll see you in there.

Then we can go to my ap...
Apartment. What does he mean?

Food sounds great.
What does he...?

Guys?

Hey, guys.

That... That's not funny.

Guys!

Help.

Oh, fuck.

Dave, can you please
not film me eating?

It's kind of weird.

We need lots of behind-the-scenes
footage for the Blu-ray.

Trust me,
no one's buying a student film.

Nice shoes.

You know, speaking of jobs, have
you guys had any luck finding one?

I've got internships or calls,
but I haven't had an actual job.

No. Every time I say I'm
graduating from South Vista College,

they say
they've never heard of it.

People literally call it the 13th grade.
Oh.

But how old are you?

Twenty-eight.

John, how old are you?

Uh, 25.
Dave?

Thirty.
See, I'm 36.

It's just a college of misfits.

Nowhere to go.
Nothing to do, but...

...literally, we're just in the middle of
nowhere filming for missing people.

Oh yeah, it's not the easiest
industry to get into.

Most people that do film end up
serving coffee or working as a florist.

Florists make good money.

What about you, Dave?

Well, I did get
a call back one time.

Um, when I arrived to set,

there was a guy wearing
a superhero costume,

and a naked chick.

Are you serious?

Yup.

Did you... You s... You stayed.

Please tell me that you stayed.

It was good money.

What was the name of it?
Please tell me the name.

<i>The Incredible Bulk.</i>

Oh, my God.

Okay. Okay. Serious question.

Like it?
You have to answer it.

Are they still hiring?

Uh, yeah, just excuse
the mess, like the wall.

Oh, my God.

Val,
what the hell is going on here?

Yeah.
Okay. Yeah. I,

I should have mentioned it
before you guys got here,

but I, I do have this slight
obsession with serial killers.

Um, to be fair,
it did start very...

...like, innocent, you know,
true crime and stuff like that.

But I, I did end up
writing a serial killer.

So... -You wrote a serial killer.
Cool.

No, like...
you know...

I wrote some serial killers,
just to put 'em out there.

That's better.
Yeah.

Um, but...

You're like
the last person on Earth

I ever thought would be into this.
-No...

I know, but, like, look at all
the stuff that they send me.

They send me, like, this,
and they write me

so many letters
and they're so nice.

Like, honestly, but... They are!

I'm just...

They send me this stuff, and I guess
they don't have anything better to do.

Ah...
Yeah.

But prison.

I did want to show you guys

that I joined this,
like, secret online group.

It's like a community
of people like me.

A community
of serial killer lovers.

No, like morbid
curiosity lovers.

Don't be ridiculous, come on.
Show us.

Okay. Okay.
Uh, we use these, um...

...like, off the grid message
boards, if that makes sense.

The dark web?

I, I'm not ridiculous.

No, they, it's...

It's like an anonymous chat,
but there has been this chat

that's been going crazy
for like weeks...

Mm-hmm.
...and it's this.

It's, like, this urban legend
of this serial killer guy

who went and killed, like, 200
people over the last 20 years.

Apparently, he would...

...kidnap them and then
take them into his farm.

It's, like, in the middle
of nowhere, and he'd kill 'em.

But that's not even
the craziest part. The cra...

Like, he would
actually broadcast

these weird videos
of their bodies.

I don't know, like, I guess over an
antenna television or something like that.

But they did call him Mr. Creep.

Sounds like
creepy noodles bullshit.

Okay, I'm just...
Yeah.

You couldn't hide
a serial killer

that killed 200 people
from the public.

I'm just telling you
what I read, because...

Okay.
Yeah, it's all BS.

It... It's not BS.

You... Do you guys wanna see
one of the videos?

Apparently one of the broadcasts
were actually recorded.

Yeah, whatever.
Okay.

Okay.
I can't wait.

Creepy dolls? Check.

Scary clowns?

A mysterious broadcast signal

sending out weird videos?

Double check.

Today, I bring you
an insanely creepy urban legend

that's been flooding
the deep spaces of the Internet.

The story of Mr. Creep.

The story claims a mass murderer
who wore an old clown mask,

and went around kidnapping
people, then taking them

to a secret hideout in the middle of
nowhere where he would murder them.

The city kept the killer a secret
in order not to cause a panic.

He was said to broadcast weird
videos with the dead bodies of victims.

Some say the broadcast is still
sending out signals to this day,

but it hasn't been found.

Only one recording
of a broadcast exists today,

and we're gonna show it
to you...

...right now.

I, uh...

I come home

after working a 12-hour shift...

...I cook dinner,

and all I get
is a mouthful of insults.

Oh.

What was that?

Oh. Oh, you don't,
you don't like fish heads?

Hmm.

Well, little Johnny...

...he likes fish heads.

You know why?

Because Johnny's a good boy.

Yeah. Unlike his siblings.

Worthless...

...leeches.

Oh.

What was that?

What was that, dear? Did...

Did you wanna say something?

No. What did you say to me?

What did you say to me?

You will eat!

That's it.

Christ, Val.

And you wrote to this guy?

No, I wish. He died years
after he was caught,

but if he was alive,
of course, I would.

Why?

I don't know, he just...

Like, I know he was messed up,
and I don't know why,

because, like, it sounds crazy, but
I feel like I could have helped him.

Yeah, that's messed up.
Uh, okay...

They said that the broadcast
was still running, right?

People claim it is.

Well, then all we would need is

an antenna and an old TV,

and we could keep
this thing going, right?

Does anyone
even have one of those?

I have one.
Can we use it?

Yeah. We just need an antenna.

...watching Channel 99...

Most kids learned their
sex basics from Channel 99.

100% of it.

Where's the power?

Okay. Cool.

Jesus. We're gonna get channels
from, like, China with that thing.

I hope so.
-Definitely China with that thing.

Hmm.

All right.
I think everything is set up.

Let's see how this looks.

Uh, I think you have to...
What is it?

The channel scan.
You gotta do the channel scan.

Damn.
I guess that settles it. I guess, um...

Well...
Just Internet clickbait.

I'll just return this.

I guess...
Wait, wait, wait.

What?

I saw it too.

Don't you see?

Dammit, it...
I just bought this thing.

Check the plug.

It... It was plugged in.

I mean,
the antenna looks fine, but...

Nice, Dave.

Um, anything?
No.

Guys, we have to dig deeper into this.
-All right...

There's history here,
it's real, I know it.

And do what? There's,
like, no info on this guy.

We wouldn't even know
where to start looking.

The abandoned police station.

Wouldn't they take all their
files with them when they left?

No. It's just like
abandoned hospitals.

Like, when state funding goes,
like, everyone just walks out,

and they leave everything.
Even patient files.

Okay, well, we're not gonna break
into an abandoned police station

for a school project.
-But forget about the school project.

This is something bigger. We could
discover, like, the new Ted Bundy

that the world never discovered.

Exactly. We, we could make
a real documentary with this.

I mean, this would help our career
way more than an associate's degree

from a community college.
That we're never gonna use.

Fine.
I'm sold.

Because, honestly, we don't have

any other job offers right now.

Why don't we just take a day,
think about it,

and then come back tomorrow,

and we can talk about
your little mystery mission.

But let's just go tonight. My
adrenaline's running. Why wait?

Yeah, I agree. I mean,
I know none of us have jobs.

I have a job.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Do you hear voices?

Yes.

What do they say?

"Cool...

...to kill people."

Any certain people?

Anyone.

Okay.

And who do the voices come from?

A floating head.

A floating head?

Yes.

I mean, I really hope
something happens.

I'm really looking forward to it.
-You do?

I do.

Okay, I'm not gonna park
in the front.

This is...

...pretty shady,
so I'm gonna go to the side.

This is good.

Okay, so what's the plan here?

Well, Dave knows the layout.

You do?

Well, not really, but...

Okay, perfect.

I'll tell you what,

I'm gonna stay in the car,

and keep a watch,
because trespassing is no joke.

You guys go check it out,
and I'll keep it warm for you.

All right, Val, Dave... Let's go.
All right.

Watch out for the spiders.

Oh, my God.

That's creepy, okay.

Let's just get in, get out.

Do this fast.

Oh, my gosh.

Oh, f...

Fuck. Just jimmy it.

What are we supposed
to be looking for?

Files, pictures.

I don't know.

What was this place, a museum?

What the h...?
Is somebody living here?

Whoa.

Beth. Beth.
Val.

Holy shit.
Oh, my God. Okay.

They left everything.

Um, what are we looking for?
Do you know his name?

I know that he wore
a creepy clown mask,

and went by the name Mr. Creep,
but no, I don't know his name.

Okay, just everyone start
digging through stuff.

I'm gonna look upstairs.

Oh, my God.

Whoa.

This must be the holding area.

What the fuck?

What the hell?

Gross.

What?

Beth?

Beth.

No! Beth!
Please, please, no! Please!

Anything?

There's a door here.

That might be it.

This has to be it. Let's go.

Val.

Where's Val?
I don't know. She was just here.

Val!

Val.

Help!

Beth!

Beth!

Val.

No.
Beth!

Oh, my God.

Val.

Val!

Val!

Where are you?

Oh, my God! Dave, she's in here!

It's, uh... It's... It's locked.

Lift... Lift the lever.
What?

Hold on, let me put this down.

Val.
-Let's go, come on, let's go!

Come on, we gotta go. Get up,
get up!

They've turned on the lights.
Shit, someone's here.

Shit. Oh, my God.

Let's go. Let's go!

Wait.

Where the fuck is John?

John!

What are you doing?

Hurry up!

Get in the car, get in the car!

Hurry up, hurry up. Let's go,
let's go! We need to go!

Go, please, go, please, go.

It's okay.

It's okay, it's okay, calm down.

It's okay, it's okay. Hey, hey.

What did you see?
I saw him.

Saw whom?
I saw him, saw him.

It was Mr. Creep.
Oh, come on.

John, screw you.
You had one job back there.

Why were you even in the building?
-I went in there

to look for you guys! You
were gone for, like, 20 minutes.

Just give her some space.

Val, calm down,
calm down, it's okay.

Did you see him?
He's real.

He's real.
He's there. He's real.

It's okay. You just...
You just calm down.

I saw Mr. Creep.
He's real. I saw him.

No, he's real. He's real.

So nobody's heard from Val?

I texted her that we were meeting
here at 9:00, and she replied

with a smiley face,
so I assume she got it.

Okay.

Let's start this.

All right.. Okay.

This is most of what we found
at the old police station.

We have some old DV tapes,

some pictures
from the crime scenes,

and these VHS tapes.

And from what we read, he died
from lethal injection back in 2002.

And I guess his calling card was filming
victims in weird, doing weird things,

and he would broadcast those.

So, uh...

Luckily, Dave had a DV camera,
so we can see what's on these tapes.

Here we go.

We know there's more than
the 20 bodies that we found.

We've estimated the number
to be around 200.

Does that number
sound right, Joe?

Two hundred innocent mothers,
fathers, and children.

Even your own son.

My son...

...was a required sacrifice.

Required of who?

God.

God told you to do this?

Yes.

Why?

I was to kill my son...

...to prove my loyalty.

After that...

...I was to kill 200 people.

Then...
I was to kill my family...

...my entire family,

and then kill myself...

...and I would become God.

I see.

Does God talk to you every day?

He's talking to me right now.

What is he saying?

He's got a new list for me.

A new list of people to kill.

And who's that?

Beth.

What did he say?
I don't know. Nothing.

Did he say "Beth"?

No.
He said, "Beth."

Let me rewind it.

It's gone. The video's gone.

It's a really old tape.

Try another one.

Okay. Here.

Try this one.

That's enough tapes for today.

Have you guys gone through all this stuff yet?
-Okay.

No.

Looks like he had a pen pal.

That's an address
not too far from here.

You're not thinking
of going there.

She could have some
real information on this guy.

We're still waiting
to hear back from Val.

Let me see.

She gotten back to you?
No, nothing.

Let's just go.

I was very surprised
when you called.

It's been years since I was so deep
into that story, everything going on.

I even had a book about him
ready for release...

...but the FBI wouldn't let me
release it without giving me trouble.

So it was true?

The town was covering up
this serial killer.

Oh, yeah.

I believe it was very political.

No mayor wants
a serial killer on their books

who's killed 200 people.

But there's a more interesting
story under all that.

Like what?
Joe.

Joe Yates.

That was his name.

Just normal family man
with a boring job...

...had a terrible childhood.

How so?

Well,

his parents were pretty cruel.

They wouldn't let him
have any friends,

wouldn't even let him
leave the house.

Sometimes,
they took turns beating him...

...and then one day...

...the parents just vanished.

Lots of people had rough
childhoods, myself included,

and we didn't end up
as mass murderers.

He was... Were you starved?

Beaten with a stick
covered with thorns?

Force-fed bleach?

Locked in
pitch-black closets for weeks?

And what about his face?

Why did he have that...

Like, clown...?
Like a clown?

Like a clown.

He wore the clown mask as a kid

to escape
from the real world, I suppose.

His mother saw
how much he loved it...

...so she burned it

while he was still wearing it.

Wow.
-The doctors tried to take it off...

...but it'd already fused
to his face.

How do you know
so much about him?

I've met with him...

...many, many times
at the prison.

He trusted me.

To many,
he was a murderer, a killer...

...but to me...

I believe...

...most monsters are not born.

They're made by evil parents.

And you two...

...with that camera
and everything, wh...

What story
are you hoping to tell?

We just wanna tell the truth.

We think the people of this town
should know what really happened.

Especially the people that still have
loved ones that went missing, you know.

They deserve answers.

Oh, yes, answers.

Well...

If the truth is what you seek,
you came to the right place.

I wanna give you something
before you leave.

The manuscript to the book
I was going to release.

It has every detail
I could collect from Joe.

That would be amazing.

Thank you so much.
No problem.

No point in wasting a book.

Give me a minute,
and I'll go dig it up.

Thank you.

Yeah, I'm getting some major
serial killer sympathy from her.

This is pretty nasty.

It's a nice place though.

John!

Beth.
Evil!

He's a good man!

What do we do?

What do we do?

No, not <i>we, you.</i>
You hit her with a cane.

T... Trying to save you!

What the fuck?

Go.

Let's go!

What the fuck?
Go, go, go!

What's with the doll?

It's not a doll.

It's a...

...relic.

Where did you find it?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

It, uh, it...

...found me.

Here.

Take off the Band-Aid.
Yeah.

It looks like it's gonna need stitches.
-Okay.

Well, just put something on.
It's fine.

The hell was that back there?
I don't know anymore. It's just...

I mean, we just saw
a knife go through an old lady.

I...
Was I the only one that saw that?

No, but she was...

She was standing there.

I mean, don't be stupid.
You saw her get up.

What do you want me to do?

Did you try Val again?

Anything?

Voicemail.
I don't know.

Let's just go
straight over there.

Oh, my God!

He's here, he's here.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my...

Ah! Oh, oh, my God!
He's here, he's here, he's here.

Oh, my God. He's here, he's...

Oh, my fucking God,
fucking mother!

Oh, my God!

He...

Val, open up. We need to talk.

Try the... Yeah.

Okay, hold on.

Hold on a second.

I think we got it.

What the hell
has she been doing?

It looks like
she's been trying to find out

where the broadcast
is coming from.

She's got a software
to track the signal.

Let me see.

Here.
-It's like 30 minutes away.

Do you think she went there?

Her car's not here.

Fuck. We shouldn't
have left her alone.

I knew she wasn't okay.

We have to go find her.
Now?

Yes, now! We have to find her,

and keep this going.
Keep what going?

This stupid video? Val is
missing. We need to call the cops.

Call the cops? They won't do
anything for 48 hours, and then what?

We tell 'em, we killed an old
lady, and she came back to life?

No, <i>you</i> killed an old lady.
I...

Val is fine. We need to find
her, and keep filming everything.

For what?

Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but when, when this is all over,

and Val is safe, we are going
to have film history on our hands.

I think you guys have
lost your fucking minds.

Now, if you wanna go running
through the woods, be my guest.

But I'm done with this shit.
I'm not doing it anymore.

He's always gonna be there.
He's always gonna be there. He's...

He's always gonna find...

No...

I don't know...

I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

I don't know what to do.

He's gonna... He...

He's gonna...

He... He don't...

I don't know what to do.

I don't know where to go.

He's gonna find me.
He's gonna...

I don't know.

John.

We need to go now.

Okay. We don't know
who or what is out there.

Our main goal is to find Val
and bring her back.

Each of us is going to have
a video camera and a flashlight,

so that we can see
what we're filming.

Uh, John,
did you check Google Maps?

Uh, yeah, but it was too hard
to make anything out.

It's mostly covered by trees.

Okay, when we get there,
we're gonna split up into three.

And I brought these, just...

If you find something, if you
need help, just give it a blow,

and we should be able to hear it
from up to half a mile away.

Dave.

It works.

All right.

What happens if we see him?

Then we run.

Just keep driving.

I'm so scared.

What the f...?

It is him.

What the f...?

I, I can't.
John, turn on the lights!

Turn on the fucking lights!
I can't!

Let's get out!

Oh, my God!

Val!

Val!

Okay, I got my whistle.

Fuck! Are you kidding me?

Fuck.

John!

Beth!

Beth!

I... I don't see her anywhere.

Where should we go?
Should we ju...

I thought we parked around here.

Are you sure this is it?

I s...

What, what if this,
what if this was Val?

The whole thing is...

What if it was Val?

No man, she wouldn't do that.

From day one, she's
been leading us on this thing.

She's the one
who knew about the murder.

She's the one
who showed us the video.

She's the one
who had the location.

We're the ones who followed her.

Now we can't find
the fucking car.

Is that Beth?

Beth!

Beth!
John, wait.

Come on, man, wait up.

John!

John!

Oh, my God. Dave!

Dave, what happened? Where's John?
I don't know.

He tried to come find you
after he heard your whistle.

My whistle? It's broken.

It doesn't work.

God.
Let's just keep going.

We need to go up this river, and
the farm should be right there.

No, Beth, I think we need to
find John, and then get out of here.

It's okay, John's fine.

We just need to stick together.

What is that?

Oh, my God.
Is that a body?

Oh, my God.

Yeah. Okay.

And the bodies,
where did you put the bodies?

Just give us a location, Joe.

Bodies?

Yes. Where are they buried?

Sacred ground.

Joe, come on.

The bodies
belong to the families.

They deserve to rest in peace.

Don't you agree?

No.

Their bodies,

their souls...

...belong to me.

Beth!

Beth?

I'm sorry, guys.

What the fu...?

Hurry up!

Oh, God, Beth, no,
we need to get out of here.

It's a fucking crime scene.

Is that Val?

She has to be around here somewhere.
Where?

In a building! A building nearby!
Okay...

Val! Val! Oh.

Val!

Okay. Val!

Oh, my God. What the fuck?

Val.

Val.

Is that you?

Val? Hey!

Val.

Hey, Val.

Val!

Hey, Val.

What is wrong with...

What?

Dave?

What the fuck?

What is this?

Help! Somebody!

Help me!

No, no, no! Help me!

Dave!

Dave!

Oh, my God.

Somebody.

Help! Help!

Okay. Okay.

My G... Okay.

Oh, my God. Okay.

What...

What is this?

Oh, my God.

Dave.

Dave! Keep whistling!

Dave.

Dave. Whistle. Keep whistling.

Dave! Oh, my God.

I'm sorry. I... I'll come back
for you, okay? I'll come...

I'm sorry. I'll come back.

I'll come, I'll come.

Thank God.

Thank God.

I just want you to know you've
committed some very serious crimes here.

Crimes this country
has never seen before.

There's a very high chance
you'll get the death penalty.

Does that worry you?

No.

Why?

God has promised me
eternal life.

God doesn't help killers.

My God is...

...different.

And why is that?

Oh, I am God.

<i>Crews continue their search
for a group of college students</i>

<i>in Harris County.</i>

<i>Details are still pretty bare,</i>

<i>but so far this is what we know.</i>

<i>A call came into dispatch
around 2:00 p.m. on Saturday</i>

<i>when a woman found
an abandoned vehicle</i>

<i>on the side of the road
near Humble, Texas.</i>

<i>According to police,
Beth Stewart, Val Peterson,</i>

<i>John Riddell, and Dave Burke,</i>

<i>students at South Vista
Community College</i>

<i>were filming a school project, and
have been missing for almost a week.</i>

<i>Police say they believe
this was their vehicle,</i>

<i>and have found a backpack
inside the trunk</i>

<i>with their film equipment,
flashlights, and, oddly, a doll.</i>

<i>Friends of the students say the
group was filming a documentary</i>

<i>of the rumored murderer,
Joe Yates,</i>

<i>an internet-fueled story
of a psychotic serial killer,</i>

<i>who people claim killed hundreds

<i>Police say there is no
