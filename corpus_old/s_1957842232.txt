Mommy, can I play a game?

Jerome, take your ass outside

Where...
Take your ass outside!

<i>â™ª Baby, yeah, you come to me,

With your love stick</i>

[JEROME TALKING INDISTINCTLY]

Hey, little man.

Hey.

Your mama home?

Yeah.

You being a good boy?

Yeah.

Let me give you something.

How about if I give you $5?

My mama said don't take money
from strangers.

Oh, well,
your mom told you right.

But I am not a stranger,
so here you go.

Okay?

I got on the helicopter.

I jumped up because...

SHEILA: This is none
of your business. Get out.

No, I don't need a...

SHEILA: Ronald,
get out of my house!

You don't know
what I've been through.

I'm tired.

[RONALD SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

SHEILA: Get out!

Ronald, get out of my house now!

RONALD: Give me the gun.

[SONG FADES OUT]


[EXHALES HEAVILY]

I like your place.

Got you a nice bathroom,

nice little kitchen, it's cool.

Yeah, it's all right.


You mind getting your ass
off my bed though?

Thank you, Sky.


SKY: So...

I hear you got a promotion.

When was you gonna tell me?


I literally just
found out today.

Hmm. Well, congratulations.

Are you gonna take it?

I don't know yet. Should I?

Well, I can't decide that
for you.

Only you can.

You right.

You absolutely right.

Let me ask you a question.

What's up?

Why are you staying
in this little apartment

when you could be staying in
the house your mom left you?

You still looking
for her killer, aren't you?

[BLOWS RASPBERRY]
[SCOFFS]

No, I'm not.

I don't know.

But when I decide
to move into the house,

I'll make sure to hit your ass
up to actually help me move.

[SCOFFS]
[POLICE RADIO BEEPS]

[SIGHS]
JEROME: No?

[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY
ON RADIO] - All right, I'm out of here.

Look, did you get
everything out of my car?

Yeah, got everything.
[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON RADIO]

I'mma see you tonight?

Donuts on you?

I got it.
All right.

I'll walk you to the door.

That would be nice.

Officer. Officer Sky.

Oh, gentleman today.
[CHUCKLES]

ROBERT: You pissed me off.

No, but I don't understand. Why do
you just keep showing up over here?

You know why.

RAYVEN: I told you, we are
done! So, just...

[RAYVEN EXHALES]


You all right?


Yeah.

I'm Jerome.

Yeah, I remember you
from earlier.

I'm Rayven.

That was your boyfriend you
was in the hallway arguing with?

Ex.

How long you been living here?

Five years.

How about you?

Not long.

Couple of weeks. Two, three.

Oh, so you still fresh?

Uh, you can say that.

You're a cop, I see.

Wrong choice of living,
don't you think?

Nah, I like it.

Kind of remind me of New York.

Mmm, nah, I wouldn't know.

I've never been to New York.

Mmm.

You gotta...
You gotta go one day.

Mmm.

Maybe.

Mr. Officer.

You have a good night.
All right, you too.

Thank you.
All right.

[SIREN WAILING]

Donte, no!

No, you ain't going no god damn...
You're not going no god damn where!

Where the fuck you was at, huh?
What does it matter to you?

I've been calling your god
damn phone, that's why it matter.

My phone was dead.

DONTE: Look at you,
dressed like a goddamn whore!

WOMAN: Like a what?

Are you fucking crazy?
What you think, you think I'm playing with you, huh?

Are you crazy?
You think I'm fucking playing?

Are you crazy?
Like a whore. You bring your ass on ahead, come on!

[ARGUMENT

JEROME: Hey, man, back up.

[WOMAN SOBBING]
You all right?

I'm all right.

JEROME: You sure?
Yes.

Yo, why don't you
mind your business, yo?

So you like putting your hands
on a woman, man?

Yo, I don't know
what you're talking about.

You know what I'm talking about?

What the fuck you gonna do about it, huh?
[BOX CUTTER CLICKS OPEN]

Think you're a cop,
you think I'm scared of you?

Huh? Pig!

So that's your little
box cutter?

Yeah, I will cut
your throat, boy!


[DONTE GASPING]
Uh-huh. Hmm?

[DONTE GRUNTING]

WOMAN: Is that
really necessary, Officer?

Back up.

Listen, nigga.

Stop fighting women, all right?

I told you about this
shit last week.

I will not see you in this
fucking block no more.

You hear me?

[BREATHING HEAVILY]
[GUN COCKING]

I said, do you hear me?
I hear you. I hear you, man.

Huh, you sure?
[WHEEZING] I hear you.

You better start learning
how to call the cops

or you're gonna be
the next woman on the news.

[GUN LOCKS]

I don't need your help.

You don't need my help?

No.

Okay. You two
have a good night.

Have it your way.

I am so sorry, baby.

I'm sorry.

[PLANE ENGINE ROARING]

<i>â™ª I look in yo eyes</i>

<i>â™ª And I can see
What I'm realizing</i>

<i>â™ª Your love was a high</i>

<i>â™ª It really had me fantasizing</i>

<i>â™ª I been operating solely... â™ª</i>

[DOOR CREAKING AND CLOSING]


Hey.
Sup?


It's a form of healing for me.

Healing?
Mmm-hmm.

What you healing?

Life, you know?

The ups, the downs,
and the pain.

I hear that.
Sound like a little poem.

Life is poetry.

[RAYVEN SIGHS]

I'll let you get back
to your meditation, all right?

All right, see you later.
See you later.

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

Oi, <i>amigo!</i>

[SPEAKING SPANISH]

What you say?

[IN ENGLISH] Rayven.

If you like her,
I'll make a deal with you.

I'll give her to you.

All you gotta do is...

just pay me.
[SCOFFS]

Pay you?

Or...

You let me taste your friend.

Sky.

I'll take real good care of her.

What you think, I'm scared of you, son,
'cause you some money-making pimp

that like to hit women?
[CHUCKLES]

Yeah, I know about you, man.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah, mother fuck a.

I became a cop
because of people like you.

If you ever, and I mean ever,

mention anybody name
you may think I know again,

I'll put a bullet so far up your fucking
mouth, you won't know what hit you.

Oh, so that's a threat?

No, Mother fuck a.
That's a promise.

And I mean what I say.

I won't think two shits of it.

[BLOWS AIR]
[SCOFFS]

Try me.

Try me.
[DOOR OPENS]

[SPEAKING SPANISH]

[DOOR SHUTS]

Rayven!

Open the door.

RAYVEN: Robert, can you please
just leave me alone?

We've been done.

So you not listening to me?

[DOOR OPENS]

Hey, Jerome.

What's up, Rayven?


I'm all right, I couldn't sleep.

You up for a walk?

Let me, um,
change my clothes, all right?

[DOOR OPENS]

You look nice tonight.

You got a little date night or something?
[CHUCKLES]

You can say that.

Oh, wait. So,
like, the ex-boo?

Somebody I grew up with.

What's going on?

What's going through your mind?
[SIGHS]

Well...

I really shouldn't be telling you
this 'cause I don't know you like that,

but I don't know.

You seem cool.

Kinda feel like I can trust you.

Trust me? Don't
I feel special.

You should, because I'm a special girl.
[CHUCKLES]


Anyway...

Jerome, I'm a stripper.
[LAUGHS]

Come on, stop playin'.

No, I'm serious.

I've been dancing for some years now.
Wanna sit down?


I've been dancing
for some years now,

and I'm trying to get out of it.

So what's stopping you?

Bills.


Met him when I first started working
at the strip club a few years ago.

He was a good guy
and he helped me out a lot.

But then he started changing.

I didn't have a place to live
and he let me stay with him.

But he would literally
just take all my money.

He just became really abusive

and was, like, threatening me
all the time.

I was dumb and I didn't really wanna
believe that that's what he was doing,

but he was.

what to do.

So what you want me to do?

I don't know,
you're a cop, right?

Can't you arrest his ass
or something?

It don't work like that.

You say
he a powerful guy, right?

Plus, I'm just a street cop.

Yeah, and?

Okay, that means he gotta
have somebody on payroll.

But I can keep an ear
open for you.

All right?

Can I ask you a question?

Yeah.

Is... dancing all you do?

What, you trying
to ask me if I'm a ho?

I'm not.

I have slept with a few guys,
here and there, but that's it.

If I'm being honest...

my mother was a prostitute.

And all I know
is she died from it.

I'm sorry to hear that.

Wait. What do you mean,
from all you know?

I grew up in a foster home.

That's why I never really knew
what happened to my mother.

That's the reason
why I became a cop.

To protect women
of the streets like yourself.

But I got you.

You gonna be good, all right?

Come on, let me treat you
to some coffee.

Coffee?

That's that bougie shit.
I'm gonna need a real drink.

[CLICKS TONGUE] What you want, some Henny?
Yeah.

Want some Patron?
[LAUGHS] For sure.

JEROME: Oh, look who it is.

Hey, what's up?

What's going on, Rayven?
You okay?

I'm good, how are you?
Good.

How you feeling?
I feel good.

I actually thought
about you earlier.

Oh, yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

Yeah, I really wanted to thank
you for our long talk last night.

I really, really, really needed that.
Hmm.

So much so that...

I decided to stop dancing.

Wait, what?
Yeah.

I'm gonna enroll myself
in school.

That's what's up.
Where'd that come from?

I don't know, I just think
it's time for a change.

So I called my boss and I was
like, "Look, I'm done."

And, so, tonight is actually
my last night dancing.


kind of hoping
that you could come.

Well, first of all,
congratulations.

I'm proud of you
taking different steps.

That's a good thing.

Thank you. I mean,
I really owe it all to you.

Nah, you don't owe me, man.

[CLICKS TONGUE]
So I'mma see you tonight?

Oh, man. [EXHALES]

I don't wanna make you any promises,
but I can see what I can do, all right?

All right, I understand.

I know you're a busy man.

Got a job and all that.
[CHUCKLES]

But I do hope to
see you tonight.

Cool?
Cool.

All right, well, I'm gonna
hurry up and get out of here

'cause I got a lot of stuff
to do.

What you got there, little girl?

I got stuff to do,
it's my last night.

Mmm-hmm.
You gonna miss it.

Hopefully not.

But you, my friend, are
gonna be safe in these streets.

All right, I'll see you later on.
See you later.

Have a good night.
You too.

Damn.


All right, later.

RAYVEN: Hey!
Hey, girl!

Miss This-my-last-night-here.
I know!

Mmm-hmm.

I'm gonna miss you all, girl.
Miss you.

I'mma miss you all, too.
We're gonna miss the fuck out of you, girl.

I'm just right down the street, seriously.
All right.

Are we acting all bougie queen?
I won't! [LAUGHS]

All right, I'mma call you all later.
All right, girl.

JEROME: Hey, yo, Rayven!

Oh, girl!

You better go get your money!
No, it is not like that.

He is just a friend.

WOMAN: Yeah, that's what we all say.
[CHUCKLES]

RAYVEN: Hey.
JEROME: What's up?

What are you doing here?

You know,
I'll miss your grand finale.

Least I could do was come
to give you a ride, right?

Aw, thank you.
How was your night?

It was good. It
was really good.

Okay. Got a lot of money?

[PATS BAG] Money in the bag.
[LAUGHS]

I got you something.
Really?

Yeah, hold on.
Okay.

Aw, thank you.

So sweet of you.

Yeah, I don't know.

It's the thought
that counts, right?

It's a little sign.

Thank you.

Very sweet.

I really appreciate that.

No doubt. Shall we?

Sure.

Wait.

I wanna take you somewhere.
Take me where?

It's a surprise.

A surprise?
Mmm-hmm.

Are you down?
I'm down.

All right.
Come one.

No, wait, actually,
let me drive.

You ain't even got no license.

I don't need a license.
You a cop, remember?


You better not scratch my car, all right?
I got you.

You better not, I'm telling you.

That bag gonna be mine.

RAYVEN: You like?

JEROME: It's beautiful.

Yeah.

I come here whenever I wanna
just escape the world.

You're really spiritual, huh?

Yeah, a little.

I get it from my mother.

She used to read these
spiritual books to me before bed.

Taught me so much
about the moon.

So tell me about this moon.

Well...

That's a full moon, which
represents our inner world.

Our hidden emotions.

Our desires.

Our shadow self.

Our fears, our worries,
and our dreams.

It offers us the ability
to escape,

and learn from the past,

and creatively unlock
and express our essence.

Wow.

I didn't know the moon
had so much of a purpose.

It gets deeper.

I'm glad you're willing
to learn it, friend.

You mentioned your mother.

Where is she?

She died when I was six.

My aunt raised me.

That sounds similar to my story.

What about your father?
Mmm.

He's around, you know?

I talk to him every now and then
whenever he wants to be loving.

But...

He's not the typical type of father
that you like to show off, you know?

Yeah.
But we don't get to pick our parents.


Word.

Why do you say that?

Just the stuff he doing.

I don't agree with it.

That's probably why I'm fucked
up now and have daddy issues.

Your hands are so filthy.

You should take
better care of them.

I'll try.

You ready to go?

I'm getting a little chilly.

Not yet.

I'm kind of enjoying the moment.

Get up.

Thank you.


[CHUCKLES]
What?

Nothing.

Tonight definitely
turned out perfect.

Yes, I do agree.

Oh, and here's your jacket back.

Thank you.

Thank you for being a gentleman.

What? What's wrong?

Nothing.
What, you got a girl or something?

No, it's not that.

It's just, I don't wanna
move too fast.

I got a habit
of messing things up.

Well, look, things can only be
messed up if the feelings aren't mutual.

Don't over think it.

See you tomorrow, okay?

Well, good night.
Good night, Jerome.

[EXHALES DEEPLY]

Did you have a good night?

What are you doing in here?

I can't see my lady?


Who said you're not?

Can you just leave, please?

Oh, I'll leave...

after you give me the money
you owe me.

What money?

My fucking money, bitch!

I don't owe you any money.

You think you don't owe me?

You think you can just quit
whenever you want?

I built you,

your life, your career.

Everything about you...

I built.

I built my own damn life.

And I don't owe you.

And I'm not
afraid of you either.

So if you wanna beat my ass,
so be it.

But I will no longer
run from you.

[ROBERT INHALES]

Fine.

Have it your way.

But I'll be back.

And I want my money, Rayven.

I want my fucking money!

[DOOR SLAMS]


Lonely night?

[METAL CLATTERS]

Look, man.

I don't know who you think
you are...

I'm gonna tell you one time

and one time only,

stay away from Rayven.

Stay away from Rayven, man.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

You're making a big mistake.

[SPEAKING SPANISH]

No.

[SPEAKING SPANISH]

[IN ENGLISH] Don't bring your
ass back over here again, man.

It's my last time telling you.

Or you're gonna have
a bigger problem to handle.

[DOOR SLAMS]

[ENGINE REVS]
[SCREAMS]

Hey, get off of me!
Get off of me!

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

Who is it?
[KNOCKING CONTINUES]

Who is it?


You gotta help me.

All right, what's up?
You all right?

They're trying to kill me.

Who is trying to kill you?

Two guys. They just tried
to put me in a car.

[RAYVEN EXHALES DEEPLY]

You all right?

You all right?

Can you help me, please?

What are you talking about?
I got you.

Where they at?

They're in the front,
I left them.

I locked them out,
but I don't... [CRIES]

All right.
Just relax, all right?

I got you.

I'll be right back.

[GUN COCKING]
Just lock the door, okay?

Lock the door.
Okay.

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

JEROME: Rayven, open the door,
it's me.

Rayven.

Come on,
we gotta get outta here.

Where are we going?

Away.

Away where?

Look, you said you want
to be safe, right?

I do. But I'd still like
to know where we're going.

Look.

You asked for my help,
so I'm helping you.

Let's go upstairs and get your stuff
and get away for a couple of days.

Is that cool?

Yeah.
All right.

You ever shot a gun before?

I've been to the gun range
when I was younger, but that's it.

JEROME: Good.

You're gonna need
all the experience.

Let's go.

Let's get outta here.


Thank you.

Whose house is this?

It's mine.

Yours?

Yes, it's mine.

My mother left it to me.

Can you put your bags down
and don't touch nothing?

You don't have to be
so nasty about it.

Please. Is that better?

Look, if you're gonna be an
ass about it, I can just leave.

Because I'm really not
feeling your attitude.

I'm sorry, all right?

Just tired and...

I just wanna lay down.

So can you please

have a seat?

I'm gonna go put my stuff
down, all right?

Is this your mother?


And I thought I asked you
not to touch nothing.


I actually took that picture.

That was my first baseball game.


She used to be the only black person
in the stand screaming my name.

"Go, Jerome! Go, Jerome!"

It's crazy, man.

You all right?

Yeah.

My family actually doesn't
live too far from here.

So I was kind of hoping that maybe
we could stop by, if you don't mind.

Yeah, let's do that.

Wanna get something
to eat first?

Mmm-hmm.
All right.

Um, where's your restroom?
Right there.

All right.


[DOORBELL RINGING]

[LOCK CLICKING]

RAYVEN: Hey, aunty!
Hey, Rayven.

What you doing here?

Oh... We were
just in the area.

Okay.
Come to just stop by. This is my friend, Jerome.

Hi, Jerome.
How you doing?

Come on in. Y'all come on in.

So are you guys hungry?
I just cooked.

No, we just ate. Thank you.

So what brought you by?

Well, we were just in the area,

and I wanted to see
my favorite aunty.

Aw, that's so sweet.
I'm glad you did.

Where are you from, Jerome?

I'm from the area.

I haven't been around
in a while.

I was in a foster home
when I was younger.

Okay. Well, welcome home.

You're welcome to come by here
any time you want.

I appreciate it.

Okay?
Thank you.

Now you know
your daddy's in town, right?

Mmm-mmm. I had no clue.
I haven't talked to him.

Well, maybe it's just your luck.

Ronald.
RONALD: What?

AUNT JANET: Come on in here.

There's someone
that wants to say hi to you.

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

RONALD: Oh, man.
[RAYVEN CHUCKLING]

Hey, Daddy.
Baby. Mmm!


Look at you.

Wow.

And who may this might be?
This her friend Jerome.

RONALD: Jerome. How are doing, Jerome?
Fine, thanks.

Jerome here is from
the South Side, too.

What part of the South Side?

The 70s.

The 70s?

Well, it's nice meeting you.

Well, you know what's funny,

is that Ronald used to be
in the 70s, too.

Maybe he knew your mama.

Oh, girl. You think
I know everybody.

That's it. You do.

But I'll let you catch up
with your aunty.

Where are you going?

I got some running around to do
before I get out of town tomorrow.

Back out of town?
But you just got here.

Yeah, I know.

But I promise,

I'll make sure I get around
to see you tomorrow,

and we can catch up.

You guys staying
on the 70s, right?

Yeah. 1152.

1152.

Okay, I'll be around
there tomorrow.

Girl, you're looking good.

You're looking just like your mama.
[AUNT JANET CHUCKLES]

Damn! I love you.

I love you, baby.

I love you too, Daddy.

[BOTH MOANING]

Okay.
All right, see you tomorrow.

All right.

Where's he's going?

I have no idea.

He's been running around since he got here.
[RAYVEN CHUCKLES]

All over the place.


Mmm. You got it
smelling good in here.

What you cooking?

A little something something.
You hungry?

Yes.

Thank you.

You all right?

You seem a little off
since yesterday.

I'm fine.

Your energy is down.

What is this, your
little spiritual shit?

What's that mean?

Nothing.
No, say what's on your mind.

Stop running from everything.

What are you talking about? I ain't running from nothing.
You are!

Every time I try to talk to
you, it's like you close off.

What do you want me to say?

The truth.
The truth about what?

What's bothering you?
Nothing is bothering me.

Can I have a moment to myself
without you trying to get in my head

with this spiritual bullshit?

Get in your head?

Spiritual bullshit?

[RAYVEN SCOFFS]

Every time I try to talk to
you, it's like you...

zone out.

Please.

It's like you're purposely trying not to open up to me.
[SIGHS]

Look.

You've gotta learn to face
whatever it is you're dealing with.

Look at me.

It's okay.

You need love around you.

You're right.

I'm sorry.
It's okay.

All right, I'm just gonna... All good? It's good?
Yeah.

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

Coming!

All right.

Hey, Daddy.
Hey, baby girl. How are you doing?

Good, how are you?
I'm good, I'm good.

So you can go ahead
and have a seat.

I gotta go do something
real quick.

I'm gonna get Jerome.

Oh, okay.

Jerome, my daddy's here.


How you doing, Jerome?

I'm all right, man.

Well, how did you
and my daughter meet?

We bumped into
each other downtown.

Do you like her?

We're just friends, man.

And what kind of work you do?

I'm a cop.

You like being a cop?

When I first started, man,
let me tell you,

when I started being a cop,
I was searching for something.

That's always the case
when you...

when you're searching
for something.

Well, tell my baby girl
I love her.

I'm gonna hit the road.

Sit down now.
Excuse me.

I said sit your ass down.

You think I don't know
who you are?

You're the man
who killed my mother, man.

And you got the nerve
to walk up in my house

like you don't know
what you did.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

Man, you know exactly
what I'm talking about!

I remember you.

Your face, your voice,
them hands.

I think you got it all wrong.

Your mother wasn't...
My mother wasn't what?

A prostitute?

Tell me something I don't know.

Like, why shouldn't I
take your life, man?

[GUN COCKING]

Your mother was my best friend.

I did not kill your mother.

She was suffering.

Suffering from what?

Depression.

Drugs.

She called me and asked me
to come over to help her

'cause she was ready
to kill herself.

I loved your mother.

I would do anything
for your mother.

Jerome.

I just wanted to save your mother.
Bullshit.

Jerome.
Bullshit!

Your mother is...
I think you need to leave my house.

Jerome.
I think you need to leave my house!

<i>â™ª You're the
perfect one for me</i>

<i>â™ª Good heart and beauty</i>

<i>â™ª But we were too young,
You see</i>

<i>â™ª Our souls didn't know
Who we'd be</i>

<i>â™ª I can't believe</i>

<i>â™ª You opened from God
All the history</i>

<i>â™ª Lately, my
mind's in a frenzy</i>

<i>â™ª Going all types of crazy</i>

<i>â™ª We were meant to be... â™ª</i>

Where you going?
[KEYS JANGLING]

I'mma step out for a little bit.

Okay.

I just wanna thank you

for being the most amazing
person I have ever met.

I owe you.

Nah, you good.
You don't owe me nothing.

Hey, do you have
an extra set of keys?

I'mma go by my place
to pick up some more things.

Uh-uh.

What?

You having second thoughts?

Nah.

Keys is in the drawer
by the refrigerator.

Okay.

Jerome, you good?

I'm all right.

All right.

Can I get a kiss or something?


I'll see you later, all right?
All right.

Be safe.

<i>â™ª Just wanna know
If I can come over</i>

<i>â™ª And put these feelings
To the test â™ª</i>

MAN: That's number five!

Yeah!

Right there.
That's what I'm talking about, thank you.

Yolanda, I'm so hungry.
Me, too.

What is that, chicken taco?

No, got that a sad a.
[CHUCKLES]

What?

A sad a...
With the cheese?

No. I don't eat cheese.
[LAUGHS] Me neither.

How are you feeling now?
Good.

I'm really having a good time tonight.
Are you?

Yeah.
Well, that's the plan.

This was the best date you've ever took me on.
Yeah?

Yeah.

Hmm.
[CHUCKLES]

Ah, man.

This is my boss
hitting me up now.

What does he want?
[SCOFFS]

Don't even matter.
It's about you.

So what made you wanna watch
that gruelly-ass movie?

I mean, the previews
looked good.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

I don't remember you being
into that type of stuff before.

Mmm, I had to find myself.

You know?
Yeah.

Stop for a little change.

You came a long way.

I'm proud of you.

We both did.
I'm proud of you, too.

Your mother would have been
proud of you, you know that?

Yeah, she would have.
Yeah.

I appreciate you.
I appreciate you, too.

You know what?

When we was younger,

you used to always get me to
try to hop on that damn train.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

Yeah.
I ain't scared no more.

Let's do it.

We're going on the train?
We're going on the train. Right now.

Right now?
Right now!

Right now!
Okay, let's go. [LAUGHS]

Tell you what, Rayven?

You know what I'm talking about.

That you're back with your ex.

Look, I'm not back with her.

So what is it, then?

It's nothing.
Why would you play with my heart and my feelings

after everything that I told
you I've been through?

Look, I'm not playing
with your feelings,

and I'm damn sure not
playing with your heart.

I just seen the girl to tell her

I don't wanna see her no more.
Shut up!

You're lying.
I'm not lying.

You are a fucking liar, Jerome.

about fucking with your weak ass.

I hate you.

Rayven, don't say that.

Look...

I know you mad and all, but...

Don't put your fucking
hands on me, all right?

Or what? Hmm?

Yolanda, wake up.
Mmm.

What's wrong?

You remember
when we was young...

you used to ask me
why I never called you pretty?

I always thought you was the
most beautiful woman I ever knew.

I was just fighting
with my own insecurities.

only one who really complimented me.

You've always been there for me.

And I appreciate you.

A lot.

Look, I think we need
to just move forward.

And you find somebody else
who deserves you.

I love you so much, I swear.

You don't love me.

You call me over here
at 3:00 in the morning...

to have sex with me.

You don't want me.

You never wanted me...
I should...

No, I called you over here
to talk.

You wanted to have sex.


That shit could have waited.

But you know what?

You're right.

I do deserve better.


Thanks.

Let's get out of here.

[SIRENS WAILING]

Yeah. No, it's all good.

It really is.

No. Uh...
They're glad to see that.

Yes. Yeah.

Oh. My daughter is coming.

Okay, I'll talk to you later.

All right.

Hey.
Hey. How you doing?

I'm glad you were
able to make it.

Hot chocolate.
Thank you.

You remember?
Daddy always remember.

What?

One thing I can say for sure.

You are my daughter.

Is that your way of telling me
you had doubts before?

No. It's my way
of saying I'm sorry.

All these years I've been
taking you for granted.

Putting my responsibilities
up on someone else.

For that...

I'm sorry.

Why though?

Why would you just leave me

as if you didn't care,

knowing that I had nobody
to run to after mom died?

I don't have all the answers,

but what I can say is,
I was running too.

Trying to figure out who I am,
where I want to be at.

Sometimes as a parent,

you don't make
all the right decisions.

That's just an excuse, Daddy.

Well, that's my truth.

Well, it's not good enough.

Daddy, do you know...

what I had to do for money?



and sleep with men...

thinking that they would
give me the kind of love

that I should have
gotten from you.

Well, you did what
you had to do, right?

What?

What kind of father says that
to their daughter?

The kind of father
that is still healing, Rayven.

I'm not perfect.

I've done some messed-up
things in my life.

But I didn't sit around
and pout about it.

One thing about being a man,

a man can never
stop being a man,

and I'm man enough
to step up and say,

I'm sorry. I admit my wrong.

Life is not gonna
always be easy, Rayven.

We have to put forth

better effort to be
a better person

and good results
will show from that.

This is me asking you
for your forgiveness

and to help me

become a better father for you.

Did you kill her?

Your mother? No.

No. [SNIFFLES] Jerome's mom.

Rayven, I have never
killed another soul.

Jerome's mother
was my close friend...

and still is.

What do you mean
and she still is?

She's not dead.

<i>â™ª Baby, will you be
My boyfriend?</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, it's a button
When I drive</i>

<i>â™ª C class on the dash
Then we glide</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, baby boy,
it's a Friday</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, baby boy,
Bring it my way</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, do me up
And do it right</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, move to the left
If you ain't about it</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, it's a vibe

<i>â™ª Yeah, na-na-na-na-na-na</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, na-na-na-na-na-na</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, na-na-na-na-na-na</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, na-na-na-na-na-na</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, will you be

<i>â™ª Yeah, will you be
My boyfriend?</i>

<i>â™ª It's true</i>

<i>â™ª I don't really
Like the nice guys</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah but I just
Need me the right guy</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, tall, dark
And fast mind</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, it could be
You, you, you</i>

<i>â™ª Tell me if you
Shoot true, true</i>

<i>â™ª Tell me what to do-do-do</i>

<i>â™ª Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do</i>

<i>â™ª Na-na-na-na-na-na</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, na-na-na-na-na-na</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, na-na-na-na-na-na</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, will you be
My boyfriend?</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, will you be
My boyfriend?</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, na-na-na-na-na-na â™ª</i>

What's up?

I just want to thank you
for not giving up on me.

Thank you.

You taught me a lot,
to be honest.

Not to be afraid, to embrace it.

Why don't we get away?

You know, like,
maybe go to New York

since I've never been.

You're really stuck on this New York shit.
[LAUGHS]

I am. Let's go.

I'm down for it.
Okay. Cool.

You wanna leave tomorrow?
All right.

Baby, I've been texting my dad.

We talk.

Mainly because I needed
closure for myself.

That's good.

I asked him to meet me here.

Baby, I think
you two should talk.

Talk about what, baby?
Your mom.

Baby, to heal,
you have to be able

to face those who scarred you.

And even though he scarred me,

he has some unknown answers

that he could
probably help you with.

That man
can't help me with shit.

Baby, I forgave him.

Can you just try it for me?

Please?

Please.

Hey, Daddy.

I'm gonna
let you two talk, okay?

Baby, I'll be in the car.

I'm sorry, Jerome.

Us parents don't
always get it right.

Some do.

Some don't.

Shit. If I'm
going to be honest,

it has taken me some 30 years

and I'm still learning
how to be a father.

But one thing I do know
about your mother,

she is a fighter.

Come on, man. Stop
talking about my mother, man.

A fighter just like you.

I'm working on having a
better relationship with Rayven

and hope that includes you too.

My baby girl, she loves you.

And love is hard to come by.

Take it from me.

What's this, man?

It's the address
where your mother is.

Come on, man, you come over
here to talk about my mother, yo?

My mother's dead. All right?

Your mother's not dead.

Go see her.

RAYVEN: You got everything?

Yeah. What the hell
you got in these bags?

We're going to New York, right?

Remind me to change my shoes

before I get out the car.
All right.

Jerome, I love you.

Girl, get in the car.

Jerome, I love you.
I love you, too.

Which house is it?

It's this one right here.

You sure you don't
want me to go in with you?

I'm sure.

Okay.

I'll be right here
when you get back.

All right.

SHEILA: Who at my door?

Oh, my God.

Jerome, hey, baby.
Don't touch me!

Well, you wanna come in?

No, I don't wanna come inside.

Now, Jerome, you listen here.

You need to lower your voice.

No, you listen to me.

How could you just
leave me like that?

All these years I'm out here
searching for somebody

who killed you,
and you're alive.

Did you even think
about searching for me?

I'm sorry.

I wasn't there.
[INAUDIBLE]

But I thought of you, though.

You... [SCOFFS]
You thought of me?

Why? Can you answer that? Why?

I wasn't well, Jerome.

I couldn't take care of you. I
couldn't take care of myself.

I wasn't good for myself,
for you, and nobody else.

You gotta understand.

I couldn't do it.

You don't know what
I've been going through.

You don't know how I feel.

That is not a good enough
answer for me.

Thank you, though.

Thank you for nothing.
Jerome...

Jerome, now you
get back here right now.

I said get back here, Jerome!

Jerome!

<i>â™ª I won't cry and be mourning</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, you said
You won't leave me</i>

<i>â™ª The sun goes down, I'm
on the ground And I'm weeping</i>

<i>â™ª I just want you to know
That I want you, I need you</i>

<i>â™ª I won't leave you, no</i>
