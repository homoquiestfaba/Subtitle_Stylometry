[baby cooing]

Come on, kid.

Just five more minutes.

<i> [baby cooing on monitor]</i>

Shh... It's okay.

<i> [baby crying out]</i>

Sophie!

Sophie...


<i> [eerie music]</i>

Good morning, beautiful.

Hi, my girl.

Hi!

Hi...

Okay, let's go.

Let's go see daddy.

How would you
      like your eggs, love?

How about later?

You're supposed to
       be taking advantage

Of the fact that
       I don't have to go

Back to work right away.

I know.

I just have to get back
         to the office.

This european deal is killing me

And they're only in the office
  for a couple more hours.

Will you be home for dinner?

I'll do my best.

And what do my girls
         have planned for today?

Enjoying the sunshine,
        that's for sure.

Get some sun for me.

-Love you!
         -Love you too.

Okay maya.

It's just me and you.

You hungry?

Okay maya.

Time for a nap.
       What do you think?

<i> [camera snap]</i>

<i> â™ª â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>[television news in background]</i>

I'm sorry.

Hard day?

Interesting.

Is maya asleep?

Of course, it's after nine.

I have some good news.

And some bad news.

The european team loved my idea

For the new trading platform.

Honey, that's fantastic.

Yeah.

So much in fact,
that they want me to fly

To stockholm to
help implement it.

For two weeks.

I leave tomorrow morning.

Can you say something?

You're scaring me.

What do you want me to say?

You don't have a choice, do you?

Then I'm happy for you.

Taylor...

If it wasn't so
important for my career

And if there was any way
that I could get out of it,

You know I would, right?

I know.

You're going to be okay, right?

What do you mean?

Babe, that's behind me now.

You know that.

I know, I know.

It's just...

It's just the doctor said
that stress can exacerbate it.

Hey.

I'm fine.

I promise you.

I'm fine.

How much time do
        we actually have?

Maybe twelve hours.

Well, we better
     make the most of them.


Oh!

<i> You should have let us</i>
           <i> drive you.</i>

You kidding?

The freeways are a mess
          at this hour.

You'd be pulling your hair out

Before we even
      got to the terminal.

That's true.

Two weeks...

Two weeks.

Take care of our girl.

-Love you.
         -Love you too.

Say bye.

Say bye to daddy.

Okay, maya.

It's just you and me.

You and me...

There are bottles in the fridge,

But she shouldn't get hungry
        until I get back.

I got this.

Go have fun.

Thanks linds,
      I really needed this.

Bye baby.

Bye-bye.

Let's go, come on.

<i> [camera snapping repeatedly]</i>

[catching breath]


[labored breath]

Smells good!

I knew you'd be hungry.

You want some?

Yes, please.

Maya went down easy.

I miss her little
      chubby face already.

She'll wake up again
     in a few hours to eat.

If you're still here,
     you can see her again.

In the meantime, let's eat!

[glass clink]

<i> (taylor)</i>
      <i> thank you for this.</i>

Of course.

I don't know what I needed more.

The meal I didn't cook myself,
           or the run.

It's been tough
       without dean, huh?

Tough...

I don't know if I'd say tough.

I mean, dean is wonderful,
         you know that.

But even when he's here,

It's not like he's
     the most hands-on dad.

So what is it then?

It's just... It's been weird.

Weird?

How so?

If I tell you, you're
going to think I'm nuts.

I already think you're nuts.

That's why I love you.

Okay, tell me.

Why will I think you're nuts?

For the last few days,

I've had this
really odd feeling.

Like from the baby?

No, more like I'm being watched.

The first time it happened,
we were at the park.

I suddenly got this feeling.

Then when I turned around,

I swear there was someone
in the distance watching me.

And then it happened
again today on my run.

Okay, go ahead,
tell me I'm crazy.

No, I don't think you're crazy.

But I also don't think that
  there was anyone watching you.

This all started
          when dean left, right?

And have you ever
       been without dean before?

Not since maya was born, no.

Well, then of course
        you're a little on edge.

You'll get used
               to it, I promise.

Yeah, I'm sure
you're probably right.

Of course I'm right!

When am I ever wrong
            about anything?

[camera snap]

[red light switches on]

Hey maya, what else
   would you like to do today?

We can't stay at
        the park forever.

You don't know either, huh?

Well, if you figure it out,
          let me know.

[camera snap]

Oh, I'm sorry.

I hope I wasn't
     disturbing your photo.

No, I was just playing around.

There's usually ducks here,
 but I can't seem to find them.

Wow, that is a
       really cool camera.

What kind is it?

It's just an old one I
   picked up at a flea market.

It's good for the outdoors
        and cute babies!

She's absolutely beautiful.

Thank you.

How old?

Actually, she just
       turned six months.

Fun age.

Fun, but tiring.

You're telling me.

But I actually can't complain.

She's actually a
     pretty decent sleeper.

Not my daughter.

Her first year, she didn't sleep
more than three hours at a time.

I got my revenge, though.

Now her daughter keeps
     her up half the night.

And you know,
   I don't feel any sympathy!

Oh boy.

Nice to meet you.

Uh, I know this
       might sound weird,

But I think I've
      seen you here before?

It's possible,
   I'm here almost every day.

I'm cathy.

Cathy driver.

Taylor, hi.

And this little one is maya.

Well hello, maya.

So, do you just take photos
       of the pond mostly?

The woods, animals.

But I'd really like to
 get into portrait photography.

People...

Yeah, I prefer infants
and toddlers though,

Because they're
so much fun to shoot.

Problem is nowadays
everyone that has an iphone

Thinks they're a professional.

That's why I
still shoot on film.

It sets my work apart.

I think it gives
the photos a warmth

That you just can't
replicate with digital.

Yeah, we tried to do a shoot
    when maya was born.

They put her in those
   ridiculous vegetable costumes

Against a garden backdrop.

Maya wasn't having any of it.

I'm sure she was still adorable.

You know...

I'd be more than happy to setup
a photo shoot with maya.

Totally free, of course.

Oh, no. I couldn't--

Why not?
It's a win-win for both of us.

You get free photos

And I get to build up
on my portrait portfolio.

I couldn't.

I understand.

Just know the offer
is always open.

It was really nice meeting you.

And nice to
meeting you too, maya.

It was nice to
      meet you too, cathy.

<i> â™ª â™ª â™ª</i>

<i> [door slams]</i>

<i> [baby crying]</i>

I'm here, I'm here.

I know, I know.

<i> [baby crying loudly]</i>

Shhh.

<i> [door slams]</i>

<i> [baby crying]</i>

<i> [phone dialling]</i>

<i> 911, what is your emergency?</i>

I'm alone with my daughter.

I just heard a loud noise
          in the house.

I think someone might be inside!

Could you please come here?

<i> Alright miss,</i>
    <i> please stay on the line,</i>

<i> We have officers on the way.</i>

You okay?

My officers have been
    through the entire house.

Top to bottom.

Twice.

Let me guess, you didn't
         find anything?

I didn't imagine the noise.

It woke me.

It woke her, too.

I'm not saying you did.

But the fact remains,

We found no evidence
         of a break-in.

Can't you check for
   fingerprints, or something?

We really only do that when
  something of value was taken.

And even then, only when
  there's a strong possibility

That we'll be able to
   pull prints from somewhere.

It's not like you see
         in the movies.

Well, what about the curtains?

My six-month-old didn't
    climb up out of her crib

And open them herself.

Show me.

When I came to check on her,
  I made sure they were closed.

But when I came back,
    after I heard the noise,

They were open like this.

Look, mrs. Lewis, can I
  tell you what I really think?

Something woke you.

Could have been water in
  the pipes, air in the ducts.

Maybe even something
    falling off the shelves.

You were in a deep sleep.

You woke up
    confused and frightened.

Things you wouldn't think twice
      about during the day,

Now seem scary.

I promise you...

All of this will look
    different in the morning.

I can have a car stay outside
      your house until dawn

If it will make you feel better?

No.

That's okay, I'll be fine.

You sure?

All right.

Anything else happens,
       you give me a call.

Oh, cathy!

Cathy, over here!

I thought that
       was you over there.

I'm sorry.

I didn't even notice you
    until you called my name.

I was tracking a lady bug,
 I guess I spaced out a little.

Sometimes I get like that
       when I'm shooting.

I hope I didn't disturb you.

Oh no, I got all
       the shots I wanted.

I was gonna head home anyway.

Before you go, I wanted
     to ask you a question.

If your offer still stands,

You know, about the photos?

I would love to
       take you up on it.

Really?

Well, of course it does!

Yeah?

I just thought your offer
        was so generous.

And new photos of maya would
 be such a great gift for dean.

That's my husband.

Yes, they will make
        a fantastic gift.

I promise you.

Great, so where do we do it?

Do you have a studio, or...?

Oh, I wish.

Actually, if it isn't
     an imposition for you,

I was really hoping
    to do this at your home.

I don't know--

Or not.

You know what,
       I can rent a place.

Make it look as good.

I was just thinking it
     might be more intimate.

Maya might feel
        more comfortable.

But you know what, little maya?

Don't you worry.

You will look absolutely
    adorable, no matter what.

Listen, here's my card.

It has all my information on it.

And when I find
       the perfect place,

I'll let you know.

Cathy?

Let's just, let's do them
          at our house.

You sure?

Yeah.

Tomorrow then?

That's not too soon?

Not for me.

How about noon?

Maya usually wakes up
   from her first nap by then,

So she'll be in a good mood.

Perfect.

I am so excited, taylor!

This is going to be so much fun!

I'll see you then.

<i> And you made sure they</i>
      <i> all knew it was you?</i>

That you were
       the one responsible

For the new idea
        for the platform?

<i> I told them it was a</i>
     <i> collaborative effort.</i>

Modesty is very important
           over here.

Just don't be too modest

When it comes time
         for your raise.

You know me when it
      comes to negotiation,

I'm as tough as they come.

I really hate to say it,

But I didn't think
     I'd miss you this much.

I'm not gonna lie,
  I kind of like hearing that.

And I have a big surprise
             planned

For when you get back.

I've been thinking
     about that every night.

Not that kind of surprise,

But I promise you're
      still gonna like it.

I can't wait.

You know, you sound really good.

I have to be honest,
 I didn't want to say anything,

But the last couple of days,
    you sounded kind of off.

I'm sure I was just tired.

It's not so easy with you gone.

I'm going to remind you
    of that when I get back.

I have no doubt.

Well, I've got to get to bed.

Maya and I have a big day
            tomorrow.

Oh yeah? What?

I already told you.
        The big surprise.

Oh, the surprise.

I love you.

<i> Love you too.</i>
     <i> Goodnight sweetheart.</i>

Okay, bye.

<i> [camera snapping]</i>

<i> [doorbell rings]</i>

Hi cathy!

Come on in.

Thank you.

Taylor, I'd like you
         to meet skylar.

Hi, nice to meet you.

Are you a photographer too?

Oh no, hardly.

I just help out
        where I'm needed.

Which makes it a lot harder
        for me to say no

When you ask me to help you out.

I have a nine-month-old at home.

So I know exactly
   what you're going through.

Oh, no!

You were right,
    she's a little princess.

I told skylar that maya is going
  to make our job a lot easier.

You can't take a bad photo
             of her.

So where would you
         like to set up?

Just let me know.

Wherever you need.

Maybe let's take
       a look around first

And then we can decide
       on the best spots.

Bring the gear?

Leave the gear.

It might be nice to use
 some of this natural lighting.

Oh, cathy.

You're going to be
        using actual film

Like you did in the park, right?

Uh, normally yes,
         but we thought

We might be taking
     a lot of photos today,

So digital is just a bit more
           practical.

Plus, I can play around
   with it in photoshop after.

Okay.

Oh, this is going to be perfect.

Just perfect.

So skylar,
  do you have a boy or a girl?

A little girl.

Who keeps me plenty busy.

You're telling me.

Nine months,
     what's happening then?

I have so much to focus on,

I haven't had time to
   read ahead in my baby book.

Oh, you know.

They grow up so fast.

They're doing new things
           every day.

Growing like a weed,
        that's for sure.

I think we should start
        in here, taylor.

I already have so many ideas.

Are you okay with that?

Of course.

We're in your hands.

Okay everybody, well...

Let's get started!

You ready?

<i> â™ª â™ª â™ª</i>

<i> [camera snapping repeatedly]</i>

One more.

Big smile.

<i> [camera snap]</i>

That's my girl, yeah.

I know this might be overkill,

But I'd hate to think we brought
   any germs into this house.

You can't be too careful
            nowadays.

She may be a photographer,

But she's a mom and
      a grandmother first.

Okay, okay.

I am... Finished.

I know, it's a little weird.

I appreciate it.

The last thing I want
    is for maya to get sick.

Especially while
      daddy's out of town.

Taylor, do you mind if I use
 your bathroom before we leave?

Yeah, of course.

So, what happens next?

<i> I'll call you and</i>
       <i> we can set a time</i>

<i>To look at the photos together.</i>

<i> But from what you saw</i>
  <i> while you were taking them,</i>

<i> They looked good, right?</i>

They're great.

I'll just need to do a
    little digital enhancing.

You know, play around
     with color and shading.

So I'll need a
       few days for that.

But then I'll put it all
     on a usb stick for you.

And I'm guessing you'll want
   some actual prints as well?

Oh, definitely.

She's sleepy.

Yeah.

It's about time for
       the nap, isn't it?

Maybe she's not cut out

For the fast-paced,
       modeling lifestyle.

Yeah, I got that.

So you'll call me?

Definitely, we'll see
        each other soon.

Thank you, cathy.

Thank you.

It was my pleasure.

Don't forget what
        you promised me.

Soon as I get my
     website up and running,

I want maya to be
         the face of it!

You have my word.

Night night, maya.

Bye bye.

-Nice meeting you.
            -You too.

-Bye.
            -See you.

<i> I'll believe it when</i>
      <i> I see the pictures.</i>

I've never heard of a
    professional photographer

Giving away their work for free.

I already explained
        all this to you.

She's not really a professional.

And she's not doing this

Just out of the goodness
          of her heart.

She wants to
     build up her portfolio.

Still.

She's putting maya
         on her website.

Front and center.

Yeah, you told me.

What?

Nothing, it's just...

Didn't you say she
      had a granddaughter?

Yeah.

Maybe she had too many photos
         of her already.

I will say, it's been nice
      having your company.

Tell me again why you
    can't just quit your job

And come and stay with me
      until dean gets back.

If I could, I would.
           Believe me!

For real though,
    you've been feeling okay?

You and dean,
     between the two of you.

Yes, I'm fine.

Hey, I'm just making sure.

I know you got
       through it quickly,

But postpartum depression
           is no joke.

And it can manifest itself
        in a lot of ways.

I don't think
      this was postpartum.

I think it was just
   good old-fashioned anxiety.

That doesn't mean it
      wasn't scary, though.

I've freaked myself out
        plenty of times.

I mean, if I had a nickel for
 every time I went to web md...

You could pay for a real doctor.


Yeah.

<i> This one might be my favorite.</i>

<i> It's almost like she's</i>
     <i> posing for the camera.</i>

Like a little diva.

I don't know which one
         is my favorite.

You weren't kidding,
      they're all amazing.

I might have picked up a
   few tricks over the years.

Cathy, when people see these,

Your business is
       going to take off.

Well, from your lips
         to god's ears!

Now remember, I'm giving
       you all the files.

So if you ever want to go back

And print out any more,
       then you have them.

Cathy, I don't
     even know what to say.

This is so incredibly generous.

People would pay a small fortune
      for a set like this.

Just spread the word.

That's all the thanks I need.

So have you decided which ones
    you want me to print out?

All of them!

When did you say your husband
      is coming home again?

Uh, a week from today.

Why?

I was just thinking
     about the timing of it.

You know, if I...

But I should be fine.

I'll be able to print
      them out before then.

Some of these would look great
    in black and white, too.

Is that possible?

Anything is possible.

I don't know I
       can ever repay you.

Okay, that's enough of that.

Oh yeah?

Okay, come on sweetie.

Okay, yeah.

Good night, girl.

Sweet dreams...

Hi...

My precious...

I'll take such good care of you.

Shhh... You're going to be okay.

<i> [door shuts]</i>

What the hell?

Oh my god!

It's okay baby, I'm coming.

It's okay, maya.


[crying out]

There's no sign of forced entry,
           mrs. Lewis.

Just like the other night.

There's no sign that anybody
         was ever here.

Except now my baby is gone!

Why can't you just go find her?

Mrs. Lewis, I know you're upset.

I really do.

This is a terrible situation.

But you need to trust me.

There's nothing
    more important right now

Than you telling me
      everything you know.

Okay.

Now, let me ask you again,

There's no one you know
   who would want to hurt you?

Enemies you may have made?

Enemies?
  No, I don't have any enemies.

What about your husband?

Are there any people he may have
  had a business dispute with?

Not that I know of.

Did you work before
      having your daughter?

Yes, I worked at a
      small marketing firm.

But everyone there
  pretty much got along there.

I just...

I don't understand
    why anyone would do this.

What about fingerprints?

We're still dusting for them.

But assuming the person
            left any,

That they didn't wear gloves,

It's going to take some time
 to match them against your own.

Plus anyone else who has
   recently been in the house.

Mrs. Lewis, what is it?

I know who did this.

Last week, we met
     this woman in the park.

A photographer.

And she came here and she
      took photos of maya.

Okay.

Okay, well she must have maya!

So why don't you go
        and talk to her?

Go and talk to her, right now!

Okay, we will.

Just calm down, we will,
           I promise.

Now, this woman, you
    have her name, I assume?

Yes, yes, it's cathy driver.

Spelled like it sounds?

I think so.

What makes you think
     she took your daughter?

Because she's the
   only one that's been here.

And she's the only person
       that I don't know.

And yet you let her
         into your home?

She said she was a photographer.

I'm sure you've let people
        into your house.

I mean plumbers, electricians...

But why do you think this
   woman wanted your daughter?

I don't know.

She has a daughter of her own.

The daughter came here
          to help her.

She even has a granddaughter.

This doesn't make any sense.

Do you know where
    this cathy driver lives?

No, I had her card, but
    I don't know where it is.

It's okay, we can find out.

In the meantime, I think
    what makes the most sense

Is if I paid her a visit.

Okay.

What do I do?

You stay here in case
          anyone calls

With any additional information.

And in the meantime,
 if you think of anything else,

No matter how insignificant,
          you call me.

I have to call my husband.

And if you have any friends
       that you can call.

I don't think it
       would be a bad idea

For you to have some company.

I don't understand.

There's no flights
         for three days?

What kind of
     weather delay is that?

They say there's an ice storm

Coming down from
       the arctic circle.

No planes in or out.

He's talking to our consulate

To see if there's anything
          they can do.

And in the meantime, his company

Is trying to get him home
       through copenhagen.

Don't worry, taylor.

He'll be here as soon as he can.

By then it might be too late.

Hey, look at me.

Maya is going to be fine.

How do you know that?

Because I know in my heart
        we will find her.

I don't know why she took maya,

But there's definitely a reason.

She doesn't want to hurt her.

How about I make you some tea?

I can't stomach anything.

Besides, detective gallagher
      should be here soon.

Okay, I'll put the
     kettle on just in case.

<i> [camera snap]</i>

Did you find cathy driver?

Mmm-hmm.

Okay, what did she say?

She said she's never
  seen you before in her life.

What?

She says she's
     never seen you before.

Or even heard of you.

I don't understand.

I asked her about the park.

About her coming to your home.

The baby photos, all of it.

And what did she say then?

She denied all of it.

How is that possible?

There's only one way.

Someone must be lying.

Well it's her, obviously!

Can't you see that?

My baby is somewhere!

Can't you go arrest her?

And make her talk?

You see, mrs. Lewis,
 that's where we have a problem.

There's just no evidence
  to support what you told us.

None at all.

I'm not saying I
       don't believe you,

But I am saying
       we can't just go in

And grab mrs. Driver
        with no evidence.

Okay, you were in her house.

You must have found something.

We went through the darkroom.

She let us look at her computer.

There's no pictures that look
          like the one

You gave me of maya.

Okay, then she must
    have deleted everything!

Then there's the
      biggest issue of all.

There's just no sign of a baby.

Then she must have
     brought her somewhere.

Maybe to her daughter's house.

I'm sure her daughter
        is on it as well!

Taylor, you're exhausted.

Why don't you go
    and get some rest, okay?

And I'll talk to
      detective gallagher.

I think that's a good idea.

Mrs. Lewis, I promise you,

We're going to do everything
       we can to find her.

We're not going to stop looking.

It's okay.

How well do you know mrs. Lewis?

She's my best friend.

I've known her for years,
         since college.

And she's never been one
      to embellish things?

To make things up?

Come on, detective.

You can't actually think that
    taylor is making this up?

I mean, if that were true,
          where's maya?

I'll level with you, miss walsh.

There are three kinds
         of these cases.

The most common, an estranged
    spouse kidnaps the child.

The rarest is what
       mrs. Lewis claims,

A stranger kidnapped her baby.

And what's the other one?

Oh my god.

You can't think?
   I mean, you can't believe?

Taylor loves her daughter.

Unfortunately,
      I've seen it before.

More times than
      I'd like to remember.

But you met taylor.

Does she look like someone
  who could hurt her own baby?

What is it?

Nothing, it's not relevant.

Miss walsh, right now
     everything is relevant.

Now, if you're not willing to--

She had postpartum depression.

Pretty bad right
        at the beginning.

But taylor is fine now.

We're going to keep
     looking into her story.

But at this point,

We're gonna keep all
        our options open.

All our options.

Are the police still here?

A few are still outside,
    but they're almost done.

The detective,
 he doesn't believe me, does he?

I think he does, actually.

But he's a cop.

They need to consider
       every possibility.

But we're losing precious time!

I know.

And that's why I'm here to help.

You and I, we're
        not going to stop

Until we get maya
      back safe and sound.

Thanks, linds.

But right now, you need
        to get some rest.

Come on.

With maya gone, I could never
      sleep, you know that.

Then let's get to work.

I got you...

Skylar driver.

I got you.

Linds, linds wake up!

I'm up.

What'd you find?

It's what I didn't find
            at first.

For hours, I looked online

And I couldn't find anything
  about cathy or skylar driver.

Maybe that's not
        their real names?

No.

The cops went to their house.

Plus, I found them.

In the white pages and on
   the tax assessment website.

I hear a "but" coming up.

But that's literally all
    I could find about them.

They have zero
     social media presence.

Is that really that odd?

Maybe not for a
       middle aged woman,

But for someone
       like her daughter?

In her twenties,
      who just had a baby?

It's practically impossible.

Plus, the mother, cathy.

What type of photographer,
        even an amateur,

Doesn't blanket the web
        with their work?

So what are you saying?

What I'm saying
        is that these two

Made a deliberate
      effort not to reveal

Anything about themselves.

Unless they couldn't prevent it

Because it's in
       the public record.

Okay, I'll buy it.

But then...

Look at this.

Skylar driver, that's her?

Absolutely, a hundred percent.

When's this from?

A couple months ago.

She looks exactly the same.

A staffing company?

I looked it up.

They do mainly medical
        and tech fields.

Near here?

Twenty minutes away
        without traffic.

We're heading over?

First thing in the morning,
      as soon as they open.

[car doors shut]

Hi.

Hi ladies, how may I help you?

We're here to speak
        with ellen mckay.

We don't have an appointment.

It's extremely important
      that we speak to her.

I'll see what I can do.

We appreciate it.

Tell her it's
    regarding skylar driver.

I'll let her know.

Ms. Mckay will see you now.

That's her all right.

Just like the caption says.

That's skylar driver.

But you can't tell us how
    long ago she worked here?

All I can tell you
     is that she's no longer

An employee of this company.

Can you tell me if she left,
      or if she was let go?

I'm sorry, can you tell me again
 why you can't go to the police?

We've been to the police
   and they're working on it.

But they don't have the time
    to chase down every lead.

Look, I'd like to help you.

I really would.

But I'm prevented by law

From divulging any
      of this information.

Unless of course,
      you have a subpoena.

Do you have kids?

A boy and a girl.

Both in college right now.

Can you imagine if something
  happened to them, ms. Mckay?

Look, I really
    can't tell you anything.

I could lose my job.

And this is a good company.

The kind of place that people
don't usually leave voluntarily.

I'm sorry you couldn't
   be more of help, ms. Mckay.

But I do appreciate your time.

She's beautiful.

You know, she has your eyes.

You think?

For sure.

I hope so.

Mom?

We did the right thing,
           didn't we?

Sweetheart, of course we did.

We couldn't let this little
   angel stay with that woman.

But...

She seemed like she was
  taking care good care of her.

At least she did when
     we were at their house.

And you know that's
     what someone might have

Once said about
     your biological mother.

Can you imagine if I had
       left you with her?

Okay, so we know
       that skylar driver

Is involved somehow,
 it's not just the crazy mother.

You're sure?

I mean come on,
 you heard the same thing I did.

I heard that she was let go.

We don't even know why.

But taylor, it's a long ways
       from getting fired

To kidnapping a child.

It's too much of a coincidence.

She gets fired from her job
 right before all this happens?

No, it has to be connected.

So what should we do now?

Go back to the police?

Not without more information.

I mean, they already
         don't trust me.

I can only imagine
         what they'll do

If I accuse additional people
         without proof.

Okay.

What will we--

[banging on the window]
            [scream]

I'm so sorry,
   I didn't mean to scare you.

I overheard you
        talking to ellen.

Can I get in?

Okay.

I'm jess.

-Lindsay.
         -Taylor lewis.

I'm so sorry to hear
        about your baby.

I really am.

What can you tell us, jess?

Well, it might be nothing.

On the other hand, if I could
  help you find your daughter.

I couldn't live with myself
    if I didn't say anything.

But you didn't hear
         from me, okay?

Technically, I'm bound
   by confidentiality as well.

You can trust us.

Okay well, skylar
      was fired from here.

But before that, I worked
      quite close with her.

In fact, I was probably
 her best friend at the company.

So what happened to her?

Skylar, she wanted a baby.

In fact, I never met anyone who
wanted a baby more than she did.

And when she couldn't
  get pregnant, it ate her up.

You know she became...

Obsessive.

The desire to have a baby
 literally began to consume her.

And eventually,
        her husband left.

He simply couldn't
        take it anymore.

And work, work was understanding
    for as long as possible.

But eventually, they had
       to let her go, too.

She'd get nothing done.

She'd just sit at her desk
            all day,

Looking at mommy blogs.

So after she was fired,
      what happened to her?

Well like I said,
   she was only a work friend.

I didn't really keep in touch.

Do you happen to know
        where she lives?

I don't know the address,
  but I can show you on a map.

I mean, if she
       still lives there.

So this is it?

It looks just like jess
          described it.

What do you think?

Go right to the front door,
   try to catch her off guard?

No, if she sees me
        she won't answer.

Especially if maya's inside.

Okay, then what's the plan?

Does it look like
         anyone is home?

We should probably try
      to get a closer look.

See anything?

No, it's too dark.

Doesn't look like
  there's anyone home, though.

Let's get out of here.

We're not going to find anything
  by spying on an empty house.

Think we should try and
    talk with the neighbors?

See if they know anything?

No.

At this point I should probably
    check in with the police.

Fill them in on what we
     found out about skylar.

You want me to come?

No.

I think I should talk to
   detective gallagher alone.

Besides, I'm sure
        you're exhausted.

You should go home
       and get some rest.

Okay.

But if you need me,

I don't care what time it is,
     you call me right away.

You got that?

I do.

Thank you.

Come on.
       Let's get you home.

It ooks like it's gonna
           rain again.

Oh my god!

Skylar, look!

What's wrong?

Taylor, she's here.

Don't let her see you,
       just turn this way.

Did they see us?

No.

How'd they find us
        so quickly, mom?


If they're looking for us,

That means the cops
      didn't believe them.

But how'd they find our house?

I checked every search engine.

That information isn't anywhere.

I don't know, honey.

I don't know, but right now,

We have the advantage.

Okay?

I want to see what
         they're up to.

Follow them?

I won't get too close,
           I promise.

We'll be fine.

After all,
     they're looking for us.

Shhh... Shhh...

Look at me.

What now?

We follow the friend.

I want to know who she is.

You sure you don't want me
        to come with you

To the station?

No, it's okay.
       You should go home.

Okay.

But I'll call you first
         thing tomorrow.

We'll go out again
        looking for them.

I appreciate it, linds.

But I understand you have work.

It's time for the police
   to start doing their jobs.

Hey!

Don't you worry about work,
              okay?

I told you, I'm with you
         until the end.

I'm going to be right by
  your side when we find maya.

And we will find her.

I love you.

I love you, too.

After this, I'll
       take you home okay?

You can be with
    your beautiful daughter.

What are you going to do?

I need to find out how
    much they know about us.

What they told the police.

But taylor knows who you are.

What if she sees you?

Don't worry sweetie, okay?

Mommy's going to fix everything.

Okay?

Mommy's going to fix everything.

Okay, let's go. Come on!

That's all very interesting,
           mrs. Lewis,

But I wish you'd leave
    the investigating to us.

My daughter is missing,
           detective.

And I'm going to do anything
     I can to get her back.

And with all due respect,

I haven't seen your department
  doing too much investigating.

We've already put out
   an alert for your daughter

And distributed photographs to
 all nearby police departments.

What you should be doing
    is finding skylar driver.

So first it's cathy driver,
     now it's her daughter?

Exactly!

But didn't you
       originally tell me

That skylar driver
      had her own daughter?

Why would she kidnap yours?

Have you not been
      listening to anything

I've been telling you?

According to her co-worker,
  skylar couldn't get pregnant!

Well, maybe she got pregnant
    and didn't tell anybody.

Maybe she adopted.

There's plenty of ways to have
 a baby without kidnapping one.

Then where's my daughter,
           detective?

You tell me, where's maya?

That's what I'm trying
   to figure out, mrs. Lewis.

That's what I'm trying
         to figure out.

<i> [phone ringing]</i>

Hey linds.

How did it go?

He's not going to be any help.

He completely dismissed
    everything we discovered.

And worst of all,
          I can't tell

If he thinks I'm crazy
      or if I'm a suspect!

You're not crazy.

We'll figure this out.

We'll start again
      first thing tomorrow.

Get some sleep.

<i> [doorbell rings]</i>

Yes?

Lindsay walsh?

Yes.

Hi there, I'm detective
         cindy winters.

I work with jim,
      detective gallagher.

Do you mind if I speak with you
          for a moment?

Come in.

Thank you, miss walsh.

Please, call me lindsay.

Can I get you
       something to drink?

Water, soda?

I can make coffee if you'd like?

No, I just had dinner.

Thank you.

I assume you don't
       have any good news?

I'm afraid not.

I would never ask this
       in front of taylor,

But is it true that
    if the child isn't found

Within the first 48 hours,

Well, the prospects
         aren't so good?

Well, we're not there yet.

So let's try to
       keep an open mind.

Did you speak to taylor today
  when she went to the station?

Uh no, I didn't.

I was working on something else.

That's why I came
        to speak to you.

Jim, detective gallagher,
          wanted me to.

He said you and mrs. Lewis

Had discovered something
        very interesting.

Well, I have to be honest,
       we thought we did.

But according to taylor,

Detective gallagher
          didn't agree.

Between you and me...

Detective gallagher can get
   a little stuck in his ways,

So why don't you try me?

Well, the main thing
          we found out

Is where cathy driver's daughter
          used to work.

We spoke to a former
       co-worker of hers.

And it turns out skylar driver
       didn't have a kid.

I was under the assumption
    that she had a daughter.

That's what we thought.

That's what she and
     her mother told taylor.

But according to the coworker,
        this wasn't true.

Skylar wanted a baby,
     but she never had one.

Crazy.

I know, tell me about it.

And did you tell all of this
     to detective gallagher?

Taylor did, yeah.

Didn't he tell you that?

I'm sorry lindsay, to make you
  go through all of this again.

I know it's frustrating.

But with cases like this,

We have to corroborate
       everyone's stories.

So tell me, did you
   find anything at the house?

No, we just looked
       around the outside.

But it didn't look
     like anyone was there.

So then taylor, umm...

Detective winters,

How did you know we went
    to skylar driver's house?

Oh, well detective gallagher
       told me, of course.

Please continue, go on.

You know what...

Do you mind if I use
         your bathroom?

No, of course not.

It's right on the left.

Just be a minute.

<i> [music accelerates]</i>

What now?

We follow the friend.

I want to know who she is.

You sure you don't want me
        to come with you

To the station?

No, it's okay.
       You should go home.

Okay.

But I'll call you first

          as a suicide.

What?

We have no reason
      to believe otherwise.

Other than the fact that lindsay
    would never kill herself.

She was happy.

She loved her life.

She was helping me find maya.

We may know the reason
           she did it.

What?

We believe that it was lindsay
  who kidnapped your daughter.

You must be joking.

No, this is the most ridiculous
     thing I've ever heard.

Do you recognize this?

Yes, this was what maya was
   wearing when she was taken.

That's what I figured.

This item of clothing was
   found in lindsay's bedroom.

No...

Mrs. Lewis, listen to me.

Did miss walsh have
    any children of her own?

No.

Any nieces or nephews?

Young cousins?

Did she do any babysitting?

Not that I'm aware of, no.

Why?

We found bottles.

Baby bottles.

In her dishwasher. And formula.

This doesn't make any sense.

Look, mrs. Lewis,
       in cases like this

We usually look at
    the mother because, well,

Unfortunately that's
     what history tells us.

You really think I could
     do something like this?

To my own daughter?

No.

No, I didn't.

That's my point.

But this...

This makes sense.

Right now we don't know

Why miss walsh
       took your daughter.

Out of jealously, anger.

Something else.

But I think we need to
    entertain the possibility

That maya wasn't just taken.

We need to consider
       that she might be--

I don't care what you say.

Lindsay did not
        take my daughter.

Cathy and skylar driver did.

And she's still alive.

I can feel it.

And I'm going to find her.

Hey linds, it's me.

I just woke up.

I thought I would have
     heard from you by now,

But I guess you're sleeping?

I'm gonna text you,

But call me as soon
         as you get up.

Okay, bye.

Come on linds, pick up.

[door knocking]

Linds!

<i> [door bell rings]</i>

Linds!

Lindsay!

<i> You know what to do.</i>

<i> [beep]</i>


Mrs. Lewis?

Mrs. Lewis?

How are you feeling?

I...

I can still see her
         looking at me.

I'm sorry.

Do you have any idea
   which one of them did this?

Which one of who?

Cathy or skylar driver,
           obviously.

What is it?

We're treating this
          as a suicide.

What?

We have no reason
      to believe otherwise.

Other than the fact that lindsay
    would never kill herself.

And I'm going to find her.

<i> I don't like this.</i>

I don't like this at all.

I say we leave for
       the cabin tonight.

You need to relax, sweetheart.

Guilty women run.

Women who have nothing
     to hide, they stay put.

The police know too much.

The police don't know anything.

They originally
        suspected taylor,

Just like we assumed,

And now they're making
       a case for lindsay.

Besides...

The police aren't the ones
     we need to worry about.

What do you mean?

You two are so perfect together.

Just like I knew you would be.

What do you mean, mother?

Who do we need to worry about?

Taylor lewis.

You need to take care of
 her tonight, once and for all.

Then the three of us,
       we can be a family.

We can move away and start over.

Just like I did
        when I found you.

I say we leave her alone.

Enough people
     have been hurt already.

Unfortunately, we can't do that.

Why not?

Because if there's
    one thing I'm certain of,

It's that if we don't
    get rid of taylor lewis,

She will never, ever stop
    looking for her daughter.

How do you know?

Because I wouldn't.

<i> [eerie music]</i>

Where's my daughter?

Where is she?

<i> [phone vibrating]</i>

Oh skylar.

We did it.

Where's my daughter?

<i> [eerie music]</i>

Cathy...

If you let maya go now,
     you can still get away.

Skylar needs you, cathy.

Think about her.

<i> I don't like this.</i>

I don't like this at all.

I say we leave for
       the cabin tonight.

You need to relax, sweetheart.

<i> [eerie music]</i>

<i> [phone vibrating]</i>

<i> [eerie music]</i>

Cathy...

If you let maya go now,
     you can still get away.

Skylar needs you, cathy.

Think about her.

<i> [baby cries]</i>

Maya!

[baby crying on speaker]

You should have stayed away.


She's my daughter!

<i> (baby cries)</i>

Maya!

Hi, baby.

Thank god.

[baby crying]

Mr. And mrs. Lewis,
        please sit down.

She looks healthy.

Healthy and happy,
        when she's awake.

Otherwise, she sleeps
          like a champ.

And you?

I'm okay.

Better than last week, at least.

We're getting through it.

That's good.

Detective gallagher,

You didn't just
       invite me down here

To see how I was feeling,
            did you?

No, no I didn't.

Skylar driver was released
 from the hospital this morning.

Don't worry,
    she was released directly

To the care of marlboro.

What's marlboro?

A place where she'll
     get the care she needs.

Where she'll stay
        until the trial.

A sanitarium?

They don't really say
      that anymore, but...

I also wanted to apologize
        to you in person.

I should have listened to you.

I should have believed
          you earlier.

Over the past week,
    we've learned a lot more

About both cathy
       and skylar driver.

It seems skylar driver

Isn't cathy driver's
      biological daughter.

We're almost certain
        that cathy driver

Kidnapped skylar driver.


<i> ...When she was</i>
     <i> just a few weeks old.</i>

What about her actual parents?

Aren't they looking for her?

It looks like they died
           soon after.

Whether it was an accident,

Or cathy driver had something
         to do with it.

And then skylar, she
     wanted the same thing.

Best we can figure
       from the interviews

We've had with people,

It was really cathy driver
      who convinced skylar

That she needed
        to have the baby.

For her whole life
       she worked on her.

Drilled it into her head.

And what does skylar
     have to say about that?

On the advice of her counsel,
   she's not saying anything.

But when she gets out,
 she could come back after maya.

Trust me, mrs. Lewis.

You have nothing to worry about.

By the time skylar driver
          is released,

If she ever is,
   maya will be all grown up.

<i> You'll never hear</i>
   <i> from skylar driver again.</i>

Shhh...

<i> I love you, maya.</i>

-Yeah!
         -Yes, good one!

Come on, maya!
