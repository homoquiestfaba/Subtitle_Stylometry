I KNOW THAT CAR OF YOURS
IS IN GOOD SHAPE.

HEY, COME ON, MAN!

SO WHAT BRINGS YOU BY HERE?

REMEMBER THAT BOW-HUNTING TRIP
WE TALKED ABOUT?

I FOUND A PLACE.

UPSTATE. I FOUND IT
ON THE INTERNET.

I BOOKED IT
FOR LATE NOVEMBER.

I DON'T KNOW. I'D LIKE TO--

I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

IT'S NOT GONNA BRING BACK
BAD MEMORIES FOR YOU, FRANK.

IT'S GONNA BE FUN.
IT'S GONNA BE RELAXING.

AND BESIDES, MAN,
I GOTTA GET OUT, GET AWAY.

I KNOW YOU GOTTA GET AWAY
FROM THIS PLACE.

YOU WORK SO HARD.

I'VE BEEN PUTTING IN
FULL HOURS AT THE FIREHOUSE

AND THEN WORKING DOWN
AT GROUND ZERO.

YEAH.

IT'S BEEN CRAZY SINCE 9-11.

THE NAVY'S ASKED SOME OF US

TO COME BACK
ON SEMIACTIVE DUTY.

IF I <i>WERE</i> TO COME,
WHO'S GOING?

WELL, UH, YOU INCLUDED
WOULD MAKE IT FIVE.

YOU KNOW AL AND LENNY.
THE OTHER GUY'S A GOOD GUY.

BE FUN, MAN. BOYS' WEEKEND.

LIKE OLD TIMES.

AND I GOT JEN
AT HOME PREGNANT, YOU KNOW?

I'M UP FOR PROMOTION.

I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M GONNA
BE ABLE TO GET AWAY AGAIN.

CAN YOU BELIEVE I'M GONNA
BE A FUCKIN' DADDY?

THAT'S A SCARY THOUGHT.

ALMOST AS SCARY AS BEING
IN THE JUNGLE--

I MEAN THE WOODS--
WITH YOU KNUCKLEHEADS.

SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

IF I DON'T BAG SOMETHING,
CAN I GET A REFUND?

IF YOU DON'T BAG SOMETHING,
I'LL PAY YOUR WAY.


GET BACK TO WORK.

YEAH.

WHAT DO YOU CALL
A DEER WITH ONE EYE?

I DON'T KNOW.

NO-EYE DEER.

NO-EYE DEER.

WHAT DO YOU CALL A DEER
WITH NO EYE AND NO PRICK?

NO FUCKIN' EYE DEER.

I WAS GONNA SAY MY WIFE.

DID YOU HEAR WHAT THOSE GUYS
ARE SAYIN' OVER THERE?

I CAN HEAR THEM WITH MY
HEARING AIDS FROM OVER HERE.

WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF? GO FIND OUT
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

SPEAK TO THAT GUY.

THAT JERK RIGHT BEHIND YOU,
RIGHT THERE.

EXCUSE ME.
YEAH?

YOU GUYS GOING HUNTIN'?

YEAH.

WHAT ARE YOU HUNTIN' FOR?

ELEPHANT.

EH.
WISE-ASS.

WHAT, IS HE WRITING A BOOK?

HE'S A REPORTER.

SO WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR CASE, AL?

WELL, MY DIVORCE LAWYER
SAYS I'M SCREWED.

I GOTTA GIVE HER
HALF THE HOUSE,

HALF THE SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

YOU KNOW,
THE LAW IS ON HER SIDE.

I SHOULD'VE
JUST STAYED MARRIED.

YOU COULDN'T STAY MARRIED.
WOULD'VE COST YOU YOUR SANITY.

SO IT COSTS YOU A LITTLE
TO GET DIVORCED.

MM-HMM, AND DID IT--
SEVERAL POUNDS OF FLESH.

AL, MY DEAR FRIEND,

GET USED TO GETTING SCREWED
BY THE LAW,

'CAUSE IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
YOU'RE GONNA GET SCREWED.

YOU'RE A REAL SMART-ASS.
YOU KNOW THAT?

STOP CRACKIN' THAT FREAKIN' GUM.
YOU'RE BUGGING ME. SORRY. OKAY.

YOU'RE A FUCKIN' NUT,
CHARLIE.

ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

HEY, WOULD YOU GUYS
KNOCK IT OFF?

HEY, FRANK, YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO STAY AWAY FROM THESE TURKEYS.

STICK WITH ME, YOU'RE
GUARANTEED TO BAG SOMETHING.

MM-HMM.
YEAH, LIKE THE CLAP, HUH?

NOT REALLY, NO.
TALKING ABOUT A DEER.

YOU KNOW, SANTA'S CHAUFFEUR...

MM-HMM.

THE ONE WITH THE BIG,
RED IRISH NOSE?

YOU MEAN RUDOLPH?

YEAH. CORRECT.
THAT WOULD BE A DEER.

AND WHAT DEER
DID YOU EVER BAG?

EXCUSE ME? TWO YEARS AGO,
I BAGGED A DOE.

OH, COME ON, CHARLIE.
IT WAS, LIKE, STARVING TO DEATH.

IT COULD BARELY WALK.
IT HAD THREE AND A HALF LEGS.

I MEAN, YOU COULD'VE BEAT IT
TO DEATH WITH YOUR BOW.

OH, GOSH.
DON'T LISTEN TO THESE GUYS.

THEY ARE GONNA COME BACK
EMPTY-HANDED AS USUAL.

OH, IS THAT SO?

WELL, YOU KNOW, JUST MAYBE
I BAG MYSELF A JERK LIKE...

WHOA!
HUH?

IT'S A HOLDUP!
IT'S A HOLDUP!

HEY, TOUGH GUY,

WHO'S GONNA PAY
THE CHECK NOW, OKAY? YOU?

PUT IT AWAY, OKAY?

YEAH, PUT IT AWAY.

WHAT'S WITH THE TOY
PEA SHOOTER OVER HERE?

IT'S MY GOOD LUCK CHARM
AGAINST PUNKS LIKE YOU.

OOH!

DO ME A FAVOR.
YOU CAN SHOOT HIM LATER.

SO JUST KEEP IT AWAY,
ALL RIGHT?

HEY, CHARLIE, CAN YOU
SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY?

NO PROBLEM. ZIP IT UP.

YOU GUYS WANNA EAT,
FOR CHRISSAKES?

BY THE WAY, HOW MANY TOY BULLETS
DOES THAT GUN TAKE?

TWO, IN CASE I MISS YOU
THE FIRST TIME--BANG!

YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET YOU FUCKIN' RETARDS.

SO, FRANK,
YOU ONLY BOW HUNT OR...

FOR ME, IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

SEE, I TOTALLY AGREE.
I MEAN, A RIFLE IS BULLSHIT.

RIGHT? A RIFLE IS
FOR ATTACKING AN ARMED OPPONENT.

IT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE
IF YOUR TARGET'S SHOOTING BACK.

OTHERWISE IT'S PUSSY SHIT.

IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE

THE RAW, MEDIEVAL RUSH
OF THE HUNT,

YOU GOTTA BOW HUNT.

THE BOW AND ARROW
IS ONE OF THE FIERCEST

CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS
EVER INVENTED.

MAN'S BEEN USING THEM
FOR CENTURIES.

I WATCHED
THIS TELEVISION SHOW.

THEY HAD THE BOW AND ARROW
VERSUS A PISTOL, ALL RIGHT?

SO THEY SET UP
FOUR SANDBAGS DOWNRANGE.

THEY FIRE THE BOW AND ARROW.
THEY FIRE THE PISTOL.

THE ARROW GOES RIGHT THROUGH
THE SECOND SANDBAG,

AND THE BULLET
JUST PIERCES THE FIRST.

YOU KNOW, BY THE WAY,
THIS IS GONNA BE MY FIRST...

[IMITATES SHOOTING ARROWS]
EXPERIENCE.

UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES,
I'M SHOOTING WITH A 30-06.

IT'S KIND OF SIMPLE REALLY.
BANG, BANG! BINGO.

YOU'RE OUT THERE
IN THE FROZEN FOOD SECTION.

OKAY! TALK TO ME.

SEE, I REST MY CASE
ABOUT IT BEING PUSSY SHIT.

HEY, SNAPPER HEAD,
YOU WANNA TAKE IT OUTSIDE?

I'LL BORROW WYATT EARP'S
LITTLE PEA SHOOTER HERE.

I'LL FILL YOU FULL OF LEAD
RIGHT HERE AT THE TABLE. HEY, HEY, HEY, NO!

THE CHALLENGE
IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

WITH A RIFLE,
YOU GET OFF SEVERAL SHOTS.

WITH A BOW, MAYBE ONE.

GIVES THE ANIMAL
A BETTER CHANCE.

SCREW 'EM. THEY DON'T
NEED ANOTHER CHANCE--

ANY CHANCE.

I MEAN, WHAT DO THEY GOT--
A MORTGAGE? ALIMONY? WHAT?

HELP ME OUT HERE, AL.
ATTORNEY'S FEES? ATTORNEY'S FEES?

ANYTHING ELSE, GENTLEMEN?

CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
ARE YOU ON THE DESSERT MENU?

JESUS.

WELL, IF I WERE,

I'D BE LISTED UNDER
"SPECIALTIES OF THE HOUSE."

AND I DON'T THINK
YOU COULD AFFORD ME.

OOH!

OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT,
DILL WEED?

YOU NEED CHARM,

AND THAT COMES
WITH EXPERIENCE.

NOW WATCH AND LEARN.

HEY, UH, GORGEOUS?

HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO JOIN ME FOR A LITTLE...

[MAKES CLICKING SOUND]
DEER HUNTING?

OH, I GET IT.

YOU TOUGH GUYS NEED
YOUR INJECTION OF MACHO.

SO YOU'RE GONNA GO OFF
INTO THE WOODS AND WALK AROUND

AND SHOOT AT POOR,
LITTLE HARMLESS ANIMALS.

WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
DO SOMETHING REALLY MACHO--

SHOOT AT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT
ACTUALLY SHOOT BACK AT YOU?

FOR THE LIFE OF ME,
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND

WHAT WOULD MAKE SOMEBODY
WANT TO DO THAT.

SOMEBODY'S GOTTA DO IT.

WELL, GO KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT.

CAN I GET YOU WEEKEND WARRIORS
ANYTHING ELSE?

NOPE. I THINK WE PRETTY MUCH
SHOT OUR LOAD HERE.

WE'LL JUST HAVE THE CHECK,
PLEASE.

â™ª

<i>[MAN] â™ª WHEN YOU LISTEN</i>
<i>TO THE MUSIC IN YOUR HEAD â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª DOES IT FRIGHTEN YOU? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª CAN'T DENY IT â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª WHEN YOU KNOW</i>
<i>THAT IT'S THE TRUTH... â™ª</i>

ON THE WALL â™ª

â™ª 99 FRENCH HOOKERS
ON THE WALL â™ª

â™ª ONE OF THEM WENT DOWN
ON UGLY-FACE AL â™ª

â™ª 99... â™ª

JESUS, WOULD YOU GUYS
SHUT THE FUCK UP, PLEASE?

HEY, STEVE, WHAT EXIT IS IT?

YOU'RE DRIVING
ALL FUCKIN' INFINITY, MAN.

FOR A DOUGHNUT?

STEVE, WE'VE BEEN DRIVING
FOR FOUR FRIGGIN' HOURS HERE.

YOU SAID THIS WAS
GONNA BE A SNAP.

WE ONLY GOT ABOUT
TEN MORE MILES TO GO.

SO KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED,
WOULD YA?

LOOK FOR A LITTLE WOODEN
SIGN ON THE RIGHT.

IT SAYS "CROW HAVEN ROAD."

AND THEN IT'S ABOUT, UM,

ANOTHER HALF MILE
DOWN A DIRT ROAD.

AND ON YOUR RIGHT,
THAT'S WHERE WE MEET THESE GUYS.

WHY DIDN'T WE JUST DRIVE
STRAIGHT TO THE LODGE?

I DON'T KNOW.

THEY SAID THEY WANTED
TO MEET US HERE

BECAUSE THE PLACE IS
HARD TO FIND.

WHO ARE WE MEETING?

THE OWNER.

WHAT'S HIS NAME?

THAT'S HIS NAME--
"THE OWNER."

HE REFERRED TO HIMSELF
AS "THE LODGE OWNER" ON E-MAIL.

THESE HICKS ARE LUCKY
IF THEY HAVE E-LECTRICITY.

<i>â™ª CRAZY MOMENTS â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª OUR COMMITMENTS NEVER MADE â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª NOTHIN'S GONNA STAY... â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª HAPPENS EVERY DAY â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª ISOLATION â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª MOTIVATION... â™ª</i>

HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

A PHONE CALL MYSELF.

SORRY, BUT WE

AND THE KIDS TO WORRY.

BESIDES, YOU GUYS

IF YOU LIKE,

I DON'T WANT TO SNOOP,
BUT WHAT'S OUT IN THE BARN?

IT'S PRIVATE.

I RESPECT PRIVACY.

SO HOW LONG YOU GUYS

ALL OUR LIVES.

MOST OF US OWN LAND
UP HERE NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

THIS LAND WAS PASSED ON
FROM MY FOREFATHERS--

YOU KNOW, TRADITION.

THIS SHOTGUN--

75 YEARS OLD.

IT'S DONE A LOT OF KILLIN'
IN HER TIME.

THE WHOLE COLLECTION'S
IMPRESSIVE.

YUP.

SO'S ITS POWER.

WELL,
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

HAVE A GOOD ONE.

YOU KNOW WHAT MY
GRANDDADDY USED TO SAY?

HEY, WHOA. DO ME A FAVOR.

CAN YOU JUST
GIVE US A BREAK, PLEASE?

COME ON.

OH, YOU BOYS COME

YOU WON'T GO HOME DISAPPOINTED.

I THOUGHT THIS BEAR IS DEAD.

I'D JUST BEEN TRACKIN' HIM,
AND I REACHED OVER, YOU KNOW,

AND I SLIPPED
THROUGH HIS PAW.

OPENED MY ARM RIGHT UP.

WELL,
DID YOU KICK HIS ASS?

NO, I RAN.

DID HE COME AFTER YA?

YEAH. AFTER HE'D DONE
RUNNIN' A BIT,

I TURNED AROUND,

AND HE WAS GONE.

VANISHED.

NEVER DID SEE HIM AGAIN,

OH, MY GOD.

SEEKING REVENGE!


I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

WEATHER CHANGES

FROM SUN, RAIN TO SNOW.

WELL, LET'S HOPE
IT STAYS WARM,

'CAUSE I'M FREEZING
MY ASS OFF.

IT'S PROBABLY THE COLDEST
TIME OF THE DAY.

OVER THE MOUNTAINS,

PUSHES THE COLD AIR DOWN.

BESIDES, YOU WANT COLD.
IF IT'S TOO WARM,

THE DEER AREN'T

SOUNDED LIKE A PISTOL SHOT.

MUST BE ONE OF THE BOYS
FOOLING AROUND.



AAH!

I DROPPED ME A 200-POUNDER

OH, DID YOU?

COME ON, STEVE.
WE GOT A BIT OF WALKING TO DO.


HEY!

WHY ARE YOU WALKING SO FAST?

LISTEN, YOU'RE PROBABLY
GONNA THINK I'M PARANOID,

BUT I DON'T FEEL RIGHT
WITH THIS.

RIGHT WITH WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

WELL, I WASN'T SURE
UNTIL THAT GUY

TRIED TO SEPARATE US
FROM EACH OTHER.

THEY'RE BREAKING US APART
FOR A REASON.

AND THEN HE LIKED MY IDEA
ABOUT KICKING UP THE DEER.

YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT HE DID.

DAMN, I'D LOVE THE IDEA
IF THESE GUYS

WOULD WALK THEIR ASSES OFF
KICKING UP DEER FOR ME.

YOU GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT, FRANK.

MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. MAYBE YOU'RE
GETTING A LITTLE BIT PARANOID.

STEVE, I'M NOT PARANOID.

THEY WANT US ROAMING AROUND
THESE WOODS WHILE THEY STAY PUT,

EXCEPT WE'RE GONNA BE LIKE
SITTING DUCKS, GIVING AWAY OUR POSITION ALL THE WAY.

WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME?
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?

THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT THEY WANT.

WHAT DO YOU THINK,
THESE GUYS WANT TO KILL US?

I THINK SO.


ARE YOU OKAY?

I'M SERIOUS.

OF YOUR, UH...

NO, I'M NOT.

TRUST ME ON THIS,
GOD DAMN IT.

WHAT IF I'M RIGHT?
STEVE, WHAT IF I'M RIGHT?

I'M ALMOST POSITIVE THAT SHOT
I HEARD WAS A PISTOL.

I'M THINKING THAT
WAS AL'S DERRINGER.

OKAY.

WHATEVER YOU SAY, FRANK.

SHIT, I MEAN,
I THINK IT'S UNNECESSARY,

BUT, UH, WHAT DO YOU
WANT US TO DO?

LET'S JUST HOLD TIGHT

AREN'T YOU FORGETTING
SOMETHING?

WHAT?

WELL, YOU SHOULD
LIGHT THAT CIGARETTE.


THAT'S THE SECOND SHOT.

IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

I'M TELLING YOU,

I'M POSITIVE THAT
THAT WAS A PISTOL.

AW, JESUS CHRIST.
YOU KNOW WHAT, FRANK?

MAYBE THIS WHOLE HUNTING TRIP
WAS JUST A BAD IDEA FOR YOU.


AAH!


EVERYTHING'S COVERED
IN BLOOD.

AAH!

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO HER?

GO OUTSIDE
AND KEEP AN EYE OUT.

I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS ONE.

STEVE, GO!

NO.

SO YOU'RE THE SICKO CHEF.

YOU--YOU WAIT
TILL THE OTHERS CATCH YOU.

NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE
EVER!


SWEETHEART, WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE HOSTILITY

AFTER THE BLOW JOB?

OOH.


I LIKE TO TASTE MY MEAT
BEFORE I EAT IT.



WHAT DID YOU DO WITH HER?

I TOOK CARE OF HER WOUND
AND TIED HER UP.

SHE AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE.

I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD
LEAVE HER LIKE THAT, FRANK.

WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

WE LET HER GO TO REJOIN
THE GENERAL POPULATION

SO SHE CAN GIVE AWAY
OUR POSITIONS?

OR WE PRANCE AROUND WITH HER
LIKE A WOUNDED ANIMAL?


DAMN.

THEY GUTTED HIM.

I CAN'T FUCKIN' TAKE IT,
FRANK.

I CAN'T FUCKIN' TAKE IT.

THEY'RE SICK.


THEY'LL FUCKIN' KILL US ALL.

THEY'RE KILLING
FUCKIN' EVERYBODY.

WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
STEVE, CALM DOWN.

THEY'RE DEAD OUT THERE!

KEEP YOUR FUCKIN' HEAD

YOU LOSE YOUR HEAD HERE,

OKAY. OKAY.

NOW THEY'RE OUT THERE

THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

NO. THIS IS WAR.

I'M GONNA LOOK AROUND SOME.

DON'T MOVE.

STEVE, JUST BE STILL.
JUST STAY RIGHT HERE.

STAY AND DON'T MOVE, OKAY?

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

HURRY UP.

HAVE YOU HEARD FROM LENNY?

<i>NO. DID YOU TRY CALLING THEM?</i>

YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

I'VE CALLED STEVE A BUNCH

AND I ALWAYS GET THAT

"THE CUSTOMER HAS TRAVELED

BUT A FEW TIMES
I'VE LEFT MESSAGES,

I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA WHERE THEY WENT.

[HANGS UP PHONE]

DID YOU REALLY THINK

WE WERE HUNTING BY OURSELVES.

NOW IF YOU'D LIKE

ON A LITTLE SECRET.

YOU HAVE DISCOVERED HUNTERS
OF A DIFFERENT KIND...

HUNTERS THAT HUNT THE MOST
DANGEROUS GAME OF ALL--

MAN.

YOU'RE SICK.

AM I?

THINK ABOUT IT.

MAN IS THE GREATEST ANIMAL
ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

NO OTHER ANIMAL EQUALS
HIS PASSION FOR LIFE.

WE'RE ALL PART
OF AN INSTINCT

TO HUNT AND SURVIVE.

THE ANCIENT RACES,
THEY KNEW IT.

THE CANNIBALS, THEY KNEW IT.

MAN WAS DESIGNED
TO EAT HIS OWN KIND.

YOU KNOW, THE ONLY MAMMAL
IN GOD'S CREATION

THAT DOESN'T EAT THE PLACENTA
AFTER ITS YOUNG'UNS IS BORN

IS MODERN MAN.

NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU DIDN'T DIE,

BUT I DO KNOW THAT IF ANY
OF MY HUNTIN' BUDDIES IS HURT,

I'M NOT JUST GONNA KILL YOU,

I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE LONG, SLOW, PAINFUL.

SO WE'LL JUST WAIT HERE

FOR A COUPLE
OF MY FRIENDS TO SHOW,

AND THEN WE'RE GONNA FINISH
THIS LITTLE GAME

AND AFTERWARDS,

FEAST ON THE PRIZE.

YOU FEAST ON THAT.

BITCH.

STEVE, WE GOTTA HURRY.
THERE'S OTHERS COMING.

COME ON.

[MAN GROANING]

MORE BLOOD. I'M GONNA
DRINK YOUR BLOOD, BABY.

SO WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS,
YOU'LL BE OUT OF MY HAIR,

SO I CAN BE THE CAREFREE,
FREEWHEELING GIRL I WAS

BEFORE YOU IMPREGNATED ME
AND TIED ME IN THE KITCHEN.

THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S REAL FUNNY.

LOOK, BABY,
I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED,

BUT IT'S GONNA BE FINE,
OKAY?

ALL RIGHT.

AND I HAVE NO FUCKIN' IDEA
WHAT I SAID.

[PEOPLE CLAPPING]


FUCK YOU.

THIS FUCKIN' ARROW OUT

WITHOUT PISSING
SPECIAL EFFECTS OFF,

I'D JAB YOU ONE IN THE NECK!

[MEN LAUGHING]

BESIDES, YOU GUYS
DON'T KNOW MY WIFE.

IF I DON'T CHECK IN,

SHE'LL CUT ME OFF PERMANENTLY
WITH THE OLD BRACIOLE HERE.

WELL, AIN'T NOTHING WRONG
WITH MASTURBATION.

IT IS SEX WITH ONE YOU LOVE.

[MEN LAUGHING]

IT'S A SMOKEHOUSE.

<i>[MAN] â™ª CRAZY MOMENTS â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª OUR COMMITMENTS</i>

WHAT'S WRONG?

FOR HUMANS.

<i>BUT THE TRUTH IS LEFT UNSAID â™ª</i>

THEY'RE EATING US?
LET'S GO.

WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?


ACTUALLY, IT WAS...

I KNEW IT WAS COMING,
TOO.

YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

WHAT DO YOU CALL A DEER
WITH ONE EYE?

I HAVE NO IDEA.


I KILLED YOU?
I DON'T KNOW.

THAT'S THE PUNCH LINE.

OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

FORGET IT.
I'M NOT DOING THE JOKE.

KEEP ROLLING.
START FROM THE TOP. GO AGAIN.

â™ª IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US
JUST THE TWO OF US â™ª

<i>â™ª SOMETHING EVER EKING... â™ª</i>
