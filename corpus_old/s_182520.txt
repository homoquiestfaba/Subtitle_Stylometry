BLOOD RAIN

Directed by
KIM Dae-seung

That hostess keeps staring at you.

You think it's the first time ?
Every port I go, it's the same.

For a man, strength is everything !

Strength ?

If you've got any strength left,
put it into your work.

Yes, sir.

Grandma !

Is our cute little girl back ?

Stop feeding her !
We'll have nothing left.

Someone's fallen in !

Out of the way ! Who fell in ?

This is a disaster !

Why can't you be more careful ?

These goods cost more than any of you.

Subtract it from his salary.

If that's not enough,
you pay the rest.

... and keep them from misfortune.

Provide them with days of plenty,

give the farmers a good harvest,
protect the paper mill,

and give the fishermen a bountiful catch.

This cup will bring peace to the island.

Have you found the missing crewman ?

Ahem... not yet...

He may try to steal the secrets
of our paper manufacturing.

Find him for certain,
discover his objective,

and find out what
he has been doing all this time.

Blood rain has fallen !

You scoundrels !

Why are you doing this again ?
Take him away.

Father, please stop this !

The wrath of heaven is coming !

The commissioner is coming !

May the Great king of the sea...

bless us with fruitful years.

Here is the captain.

Spare me a little gratuity, will you ?

Are you drunk again ?

How many times has it been ?

Don't think we will keep
feeding you money forever.

Don't be unreasonable.

You know this small tongue of mine
can put you in great danger ?

For the occasional coin
I can be kept silent.

Don't be so stingy.

Come to the port after the shamanic ritual.

I live thanks to your generosity.

Is the game over yet ?

I'll bring some money later,
so deal first.

Hey everyone, we set sail at dawn,
so don't drink too much.

Hey, don't think you can sail off
so easily with my money.

Hey you, I'll find some way
to cover your pay, so brighten up.

Yes, captain.

The mood is dark enough already.

To cheer you up,
Let's go see the ritual...

Don't you know that outsiders
can't go near the ritual ?

Do you want to bring on misfortune ?

I'll be watching over you all night !

Won't you bring this man some food ?

I'm on my way.

What are you doing ?

The summerheat is at its peak.

Do not concern yourself.

It may be the last time for me.

I should at least offer my respects.

My lord, please don't say such things.

Please stay healthy,

and continue blessing us
with your benevolent rule.

Benevolent rule ?

Don't you know this village
has no ruler besides our king ?

Are you trying to make me
into a traitor ?

If you speak such
reckless words again...

I am filled with shame, my lord.

Have you been living comfortably
after tearing my body to shreds ?

Commissioner KANG !

Your blood shall soak the ground
and your flesh stripped to the bone !

Captain, something
terrible has happened !

Fire !

Put the fire out !

What is this ? Fire !

Fire !

Put the fire out ! Oh my God !

What happened ?

What were the guards doing ?

Just put out the fire !

Save the paper first !

Go and save the paper !

Day 1

It's just a small island,
but due to the paper mill,

it has become the
province's wealthiest area.

Most of the paper is sent
to the mainland or to China,

but twice a year it is paid
to the government as tribute.

The burned paper was of the highest
quality, destined for tribute.

Sir, we have almost arrived,
please try to bear it a bit longer.

You must have suffered
during this long journey.

I am JO Dal-ryong,
the man who wrote you.

This is the emissary,
came to investigate the case.

I am Officer LEE Won-kyu.
Is there another port on the island ?

No, this is the only one.

It may have been arson,
so no one should leave this island.

It is absolutely forbidden.

I trust you've been well,
and all is fine with the governor ?

You knew of the emissary's visit.
What kind of reception is this ?

Are you looking for a reprimand ?

It shames me to inform you,
but this morning...

The people cleaning up discovered it.

This is JANG Hak-soo,
one of the workers at the mill.

This is the son of
Lord KIM Chi-seong.

I am KIM In-kwon.

Is your father doing well ?

Yes, sir.

I met him when I worked
as a palace guard.

He was a man of honor.

There is little bleeding
around the wound.

And as there is no swelling, he must
have died before being impaled.

It seems that whoever committed
this act bore a deep grudge.

You scoundrel !
You set the fire on the ship, didn't you ?

Stop talking nonsense.

During the ritual
you were milling about the cargo ship !

Isn't that right ?

Aren't you the one who
poaches from the sesame field ?

What a fool.

You !

Losing the ship was bad enough,
now I'm accused of murder ?

It's not true, my lord !

What did you do last night ?

I was in low spirits,
so I drank with my crewmen all night.

I'm not lying, sir !

Is this true ?

Yes, sir.

After leaving the tavern,
the captain went to sleep.

At dawn... it was close to dawn.

From the corpse's rigid condition,

it seems JANG Hak-soo was killed
a couple hours past midnight.

If the sailor's words are true,
then he cannot be the criminal.

This is Doctor NAM.

This is Doo-ho, a paper mill dyer.
He will draw the autopsy illustration.

And those men... ?

They will perform the autopsy.
Let us begin.

20 centimeters long. .

20 centimeters.

Who is this man ?

His name is JANG Hak-soo,
a lazy man...

... who usually spent his time
drinking and gambling.

While the town held the ritual,
he was gambling as usual.

Did you make inquiries about
who saw him last ?

Yes, but it appears no one saw him
after his fight with the captain.

We couldn't find any further wounds
on the body.

Was he poisoned ?

Yes, sir. I also learned a local
medicine shop grows aconitum.

That is correct. It is effective
against neuralgia and chills.

The plant's root is very poisonous.
It is used to make poisoned arrows.

What were you doing after midnight ?

I was sleeping at home.

I heard you bought
some aconitum a few days ago.

Yes, I bought it for my neuralgia.

I heard you bought
at least a month's worth.

Then where is
the remaining medicine ?

You don't have any.
Because you poisoned JANG Hak-soo.

And you impaled the corpse
to hide the cause of death !

This isn't much,
but please eat your fill.

So he has fallen ill.

I hoped to greet him
after these many years.

Did he happen to remember my name ?

Yes.

You requested your
brother-in-law's promotion

when he was
in the State Archive...

It was nothing.

I just wanted to show my gratitude,
for looking after my brother-in-law.

I hope his condition improves soon.

I will let you know
when he feels better.

You have solved the incident
in a matter of days...

It was all thanks to the Emissary.

That's not true... I did nothing.

Did you know that he is
the son of Lord LEE Ji-sang ?

Like father, like son...

Is that so ?

I have the honor to meet his son.

Surely there is no one
who hasn't heard of his Lord.

Could you tell us
about your father ?

He was very strict with me.

Even though he spent
many days away from home,

I felt that not a day passed
without his reprimands.

So whenever he came home,
I tried to stay outside to avoid him.

What did you do so wrong,

for your father to scold you so often ?

It's not that.

Each time he came home,
he gave me a riddle.

They were difficult, but he scolded
me for being wrong or not answering.

So I couldn't help but
want to run away.

I'm sure he did so
to keep you studying.

Would you mind telling me
one of his riddles ?

Would you like to try
to solving one ?

One day, he gave me this...

A 60 bo circle piece of land is
inscribed with a perfect pentagon.

A 3-square bo plot of land
yields 30 doi of barley.

Nine farmers give the landowner
80% of their barley harvest.

If, due to a drought, the yield
were reduced to 30%,

how much would
the land owner receive ?

That's quite a challenge.

It's 34 bags, isn't it ?

Using trigonometry and statistics,
we find that number,

but that's not the answer
my father wanted.

Then, did you find the answer ?

Yes, I did.

I can't come up with anything.

I hope you apply the same brilliance
to find who burned the cargo ship.

Day 2

Yes, sir.

You set the fire out of anger
at being beaten by Commissioner JO ?

No, my Lord. I was at the tavern...

This man was drinking at my tavern.
I was watching over him.

Did you serve him food at the inn ?

Yes, I served him food, then...

You spent the night
together with this man ?

Yes.

No, it wasn't like that...

At the start of the ritual,
JANG Hak-soo was at the harbour ?

Yes, lord. He was drunk and
wandering around the harbor.

When you discovered the burning ship,
did you see where the fire started ?

Maybe it was near here.

What color was the smoke ?

Blue !

Blue ?

Yes, it was a dim blue color.

You were drunk, weren't you ?

Yes, I was drinking,
and with the hostess, then...

Why is such a large paper mill
located on this remote island ?

This place has long been famous
for its sweet gum trees.

The water and sunlight are
ideally suited for paper making,

and furthermore I heard that
the mill's founder, KANG Seung-ryul,

wanted to keep
the methods of his craft secret.

Welcome, my Lord.

I will guide you.

Mulberry trees are mashed here,
and mixed with glues and dyes.

Then the pulp flows down this drain
and collects in that container.

You surely know how important
the paper tribute is.

If the tribute is late,
you will be severely punished.

I am pushing my workers
day and night to produce paper,

but it will still take
at least one month.

Who suffers most if the tribute is lost ?

The mill's owner will suffer the most.
His punishment will...

Did the murdered JANG Hak-soo
have a grudge against the owner ?

Not at all, my lord. The owner
never had a problem with anyone.

But Hak-soo held a grudge
against everyone else.

In my view, it seems
everyone is happy he is dead.

My lord, watch out !

My lord, are you hurt ?

My lord !

Quickly, get a doctor !

I am alright.

My deepest apologies.

Thank you.

My lord, the captain is here.

Let him in.

All the crew members say
they don't recognize these objects.

Do you know
where any of this came from ?

I'm not sure...
this isn't from the mast.

If they don't belong to the crew,
where did they come from ?

Has anything strange happened
recently among the crew ?

Three days before the fire,
a crewman named LEE went missing.

What kind of man is he ?

He spoke rarely, and kept to himself.
He didn't mix with the crew.

Was this his first time to the island ?

No, my lord.
Has it been three years ?

Every year he's volunteered
to come for the paper tribute.

The wound is deep,
so I applied medicine.

It should start to heal now.

Open the door.

Officer JANG !

I just heard about it in detail.

Did you get rid of Hak-soo
because of that ?

I was so worried that he would talk.

But why did you do it that way ?

Why did you impale him on a spear ?

I only poisoned his drink.
Why would I do something like that ?

You didn't do it ?

The voice of the shaman
was definitely Commissioner KANG's.

People even say
they saw blood rain.

Please get me off this island !
I can't bear it any longer.

Listen !
Tomorrow, you will be sent to prison.

I'll make a deal with
the prison guards, so keep quiet.

Even if you suffer greatly,
trust me and don't say anything.

Understand ?

Help, help me !

Please help me !

Help, help me !

Forgive me !
Please forgive me !

Day 3

What is this ?

What kind of stench is this ?

My lord !

As if punishment for high treason,
one has been impaled on a spear,

and another boiled alive.

What are they trying to hide ?

I heard Officer JANG
dropped by last night.

Please, get me off of this island !

You must explain what is happening
before we send you anywhere !

After HWANG Sa-young's execution...
The catholic traitor ?

... five anonymous men informed on
Commissioner KANG.

He was found guilty
of providing money to HWANG.

KANG was discovered
to be a Catholic,

and so to set an example to others,

the Inquisitor killed
one family member a day,

in five different ways.

What do you mean,
five different ways in five days ?

His young son
was impaled on a spear.

His daughter was boiled to death.

His wife was suffocated with paper,

and his old mother
got her head cracked.

And on the fifth day,

Commissioner KANG
had his limbs torn from his body.

Then someone is killing
the informants in the same manner ?

The informants were anonymous,
how did he know who they were ?

How should I know ?

Are you one of the informants ?

Then you must know
the remaining two informants.

We must solve the case
to send you to the mainland.

To solve it quickly,
we need to know what he wants.

How can you solve a murder
committed by a ghost ?

You're the one who killed
JANG Hak-soo.

I poisoned him,
but I did not impale him on a spear !

There must be a report
at the government office.

Take him away.

Yes, sir.

Protect me, please !
I may be next.

Put one officer on guard,
and have others lie in ambush.

If he's speaking the truth,
the murderer will come to him.

I looked in KANG's account book
at the paper mill,

and most of the towns people
were in debt to him.

But when he was charged with treason,
all had their debts forgiven.

After KANG died,

KIM Chi-seong, who owned 20%
of the mill, became owner.

Please look up there.

Catholic families have
talismans in their homes.

Before being punished,
Catholics may renounce their faith,

but for KANG not only
was that procedure omitted,

but he was executed on the island
without being sent to a court.

Perhaps his family...

So he was executed without reason ?

Perhaps the reason why
the informants were scared to appear

is because, for false accusations,

informants would be executed
by the same means as the accused.

Lieutenant LEE !

Now you are thinking dangerous thoughts.

To say that KANG's family
was falsely executed

is to imply the Inquisitor, acting
in the King's name, failed his duty.

Everything we know suggests
that KANG was not Catholic.

And someone who knows this
is taking revenge on the informants.

What are you talking about ?

What's the connection
between KANG and the arson ?

Do you mean that a traitor
has followers on the island ?

If the criminal is killing the informants,
three more remain.

So you posted that notice ?

People are reading it
and becoming even more worried.

Public sentiment is tossing
like the sea in a storm.

If we catch the criminal,
people will be put at ease.

I must meet your father.

He will know better than anyone
what happened then.

My father remains ill
from the shock of the arson.

Please wait until he has recovered.

Surely, we won't bother him
without any evidence.

As he is ill, we will wait for his recovery.

What is your reason
for staying in this place ?

Is it devotion to your dead master ?

If you are so devoted,
then why are you still alive ?

Your master died,
so why don't you follow him ?

Why do you live on with no regrets ?

That is not the case, my lord.

The cauldron where JANG died
was for mixing dye.

Was that your responsibility ?

Yes, my lord.

However I did not use it on that day.

I will ask...
When did you start serving KANG ?

I served him since I was 7 years old.

I was orphaned before coming
to the island, and he took me in.

I heard KANG taught you drawing.
Can you write as well ?

Only my name, with effort.

Is this Commissioner KANG ?

Yes.

Drawing or holding a portrait
of a convicted man is a crime,

are you aware of this ?

I didn't know that,
but they are like parents to me.

I will confiscate it.

By the way, do you think
the commissioner was guilty ?

I am asking you if the
commissioner was Catholic.

I don't know of such things.
