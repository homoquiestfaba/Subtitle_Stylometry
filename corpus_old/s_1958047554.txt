<i>What is it?</i>

<i>Can</i>
<i>you stop filming me?</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>-It's a heart.</i>
<i>-Little heart?</i>

All right,
settle down, class.

Hey.

Settle down, class?

Thank you.

We have a guest here that
would like to talk to you

about a very important issue.

-Detective Mitchell?
-Thank you.

Hi everyone.

I'm investigating
the disappearance

of your classmate,
Melissa Brown.

A daughter, a sister,

and a dear friend
of many of you.

This case has been
frustrating and heartbreaking

for all concerned.

Unfortunately, at this
point in the case,

we suspect foul play.

Any detail could be
vitally important

in helping us locate her.

And as always,
Counselor Fink's office

is always open if you
guys need to talk.

Okay?

Notebooks out.

You know this girl?

Hey, Schroder.

What's up?

Hey, so this is
kind of awkward,

but your dad is on the
board at Penbrook, right?

You want me to put in a good
word for you, don't you?

Someone else already
asked you to do that?

Yeah, just you and every other

scholarship kid at this school.

Well, difference is I'm
actually just wait listed.

So, I was thinking
maybe if your dad

could write me a letter
of recommendation

that would help swing
things in my favor?

Yeah, that's not
really how this works,

but I wouldn't expect
you to understand that.

I mean, we barely
even know each other.

We've been in every class
together since freshman year.

Right. Uh...

Maybe you should just
call my dad's office.

I have tried, multiple times.

His secretary just keeps
telling me that he's busy.

So I thought--

There you go.

He's a busy guy.

His dad's a fucking
congressman, bro.

Busy guy.
What the fuck do you expect?

Hey, are you still having your

Heaven and Hell party tonight?

Do you see this man's face?

Yeah, it's to be expected.

It's a theme party, in
case you didn't catch that.

Hey.

Hey.

Well, what was that?

Um, we're gonna go to
a party tonight.

-His party?
-Yeah.

Yeah, no way am I going.

Yes, it's gonna be fun.

We hate fun.

Well, this...

Is this about Penbrook?

Okay, so what's your plan?

You're gonna, what, use
Schroder to get to his dad?

I don't know, I don't know.

I don't know, this
might be my only chance,

and you're not gonna
leave me behind.

Of course not, but
we're not even invited.

You don't have to be invited
to a high school party,

you just show up...um,

in themed costumes.

Nope!

That's your
Mama's coat, isn't it?

Huh.

Are your girls
cold or something?

Actually, I like my
body being covered up.

Thank you.

All right,
Zara.

Y'all are in the fancy part
of town, I'll tell you what.

Why don't you hand
out some of these

business cards for
me at the party?

Dad.

Actually, you can
just pull over.

Right here's fine.

Mess up this
guy's grass.

Dad, stop.

Dad, Dad, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

Stop, okay.
I stopped!

Thank you.

Thanks for
the ride, Mr. Murphy.

You're welcome, darling.

Y'all have fun.

Okay.

-For you?
-Oh, god.

You actually bought them.

Oh, Dad?

Hey, what are you doing?

I'm just gonna
walk you over there.

No, it's okay,
Dad, it's okay, your back.

I don't want you to
strain your back.

I want you to be safe.

It's okay, it's
just, it's right there.

We'll be fine.

All right, you win.

Thank you.

Okay, well, we'll call you.

I know.

'Cause if you don't,
I'm rolling right up

to the front door
in my baby here.

God, I hate how
much you love this car.

Okay, we'll call. Bye!

Not as much as I love you.

The wings look good!

-Black is a nice touch.
-Yeah, I like them.

So excited, you know?

I can hear your sarcasm.

I cannot believe
you're making me do this.

It's not
gonna be as bad--

I mean, look at them,
they're already leaving.

Clearly it sucks.

No.

-Zara--
-Please.

Come on, Eden, seriously.

Look at this fucking house!

Listen to me, okay?

I have a plan, and it's
gonna go so smoothly,

and we'll be super fast, and
if while we're here, you know,

Schroder decides
that we're besties

and he wants to
introduce me to his dad,

and then I get to go
to Penbrook with you,

then all this is worth it.

You really think that
you're gonna become besties

in one fucking night?

Schroder sucks.

-Listen--
-Schroder sucks.

I know he does.

But here's, okay--

Let's maybe not look at how
everybody else is dressed.

No, listen, it's all
gonna work out, okay?

And we're gonna be
roommates next year.

We just have to do this.

It's gonna be great.

I swear I have a plan
and it's gonna be

so quick, and then
we can leave.

You're so good at
being so manipulative.

Nope.

No, no, no, please, please.

-Eden.
-Yeah.

We're just gonna be here
for like five minutes.

Okay?

This will be so fast.

Hey, yo.

Phones go in the box.

Why?

Congressman
Schroder lives here.

You really think we'd
be throwing a party?

Here, I'll just, can you put
your phone in there, please?

You coming in or not?

I hate you.

We're gonna get
them back, right?

After the party, smart girls.

Oh, hey.

Okay.

I hate it here.

Let's go.

Okay, I need you to go
get Gooch off the table.

-What?
-Yes.

No, Gooch?

He's like a horny
trust fund baby.

Listen, the sooner you do this,

the sooner we can
go home, okay?

-You promise?
-I promise.

Please?

-Okay.
-Okay.

You got it.

All right.

-It's going right in.
-Sup.

Hi.

Hi.

Yeah, okay.

So um...

Do you wanna make me
a drink or something?

-What do I do?
-Go.

Yeah.

Yeah.

-Totally.
-Great, okay.

Alright, I guess it's just
me against you two.

Whoa, looks like you
could use a partner.

Un-fucking-believable.

So, you play the cello, right?

It's called an oboe.

What the fuck do
you do with an oboe?

Get a full ride to Penbrook.

What?!

Wow!

Well, I realize
that it's the least

competitive scholarship
for ivy league schools.

And nobody, obviously,
plays the oboe, so.

But now you're like going
for free though, right?

-Yeah.
-It's like...

Really fucking smart.

I am fucking smart.

Only way I'm getting into
college is if my dad donates

like a million dollars,
which is not gonna happen.

'Cause he calls me
his little fuck-up.

So what are you making
over there, hmm?

Yes, this.

It is a gift for your
tongue, for your taste buds.

Sorry, I'm sorry.

For you.

Oh fuck.

-Good fuck?
-Yeah, actually.

Actually It's
like really good.

-You like it?
-Yeah.

Is this gonna get me
fucked up, though?

Have you
seen my sister?

Has anybody see my sister?!

Did you see her?

-You're a liar.
-I just told you I didn't.

You're all liars!

-Is that Melissa's sister?
-You know where she is?

Yeah.

What about you?

Have you seen my sister?

This is not a
good luck, sweetie.

-My god, shut up.
-Oh, fuck!

Hey, all right, all right.

Come on, it's a party!

Get her outta here.

No, get your hands off me.

One of you knows something.

I'm not leaving here
until I find out

-where the fuck my sister is!
-That didn't fucking work.

You got that?!

-Yo.
-No, no, don't touch me.

Just go take care
of this bitch okay?

I'll drive her home.

I'll take her home.

It's in the garage.

Okay.

I'll be back.

You okay?

Mm-hmm.

Tanya, you're home.

My sister used to do this.

Tanya.

-Are you okay, honey?
-I'm fine, Dad.

Let's just get you
in the house.

-Look, I was worried to death.
-I'm okay.

Jesus.

Thinking
of stealing it?

Let me show you something.

That's what I gotta live up to.

If I don't become
president, I'll basically

be considered a fuck-up.

Well, just become
president then, right?

Can't be that hard.

Okay.

Ah, you're killing me.

Killing me.

When my family
first landed here,

a native chief gave that to my

great-great-great grandfather.

Right.

See this?

My great grandfather stole
this from a German soldier

he killed in World War II.

Still works.

Wanna hold it?

Schroder, so, you know,
speaking of your family.

Mm-hmm.

What do you think about
introducing me to your dad?

My dad?

You're really determined
to use me, aren't you?

Hmm.

What's your pitch?

Penbrook has been
my dream school

for as long as I can remember,

and not a single other
person in my family

has gone to college.

I mean, I've had no help.

I don't come from money.

I haven't had any tutors.

I couldn't afford SAT prep.

I mean, Schroder, I
have done all of this

completely on my own,
and I'm just wait-listed.

And if I could just
talk to your dad.

That's wonderful.

But it's also a lie.

You said you've done it
completely on your own,

If I did hear correctly,
and that's not true.

'cause now you need my help.

If I could just
talk to your dad.

Where are you going?

We're still on the
table, partner.

All right, you guys
ready to get fucked?

All day, bro.

All day, let's go.

Don't miss, no pressure.

Oh!

Okay, okay.

Hey, you got it, you got it.

All right.

All you, bro.

Well, you know, it was...

Fuck your fucking game.

Demon little whores.
Okay.

Ok, Zara, jeez.

-Hey!
-Hey.

Hey, what's up?

Are you drunk?

No.

I just had a little one.

Hey, Eden?

Can we go home now?

Yes, we are gonna
go home so soon.

People are gross here.

They are, I know.

Can we pause the game
for just two minutes?

-Two minutes.
-You look naked!

-Come on.
-All right.

You got two minutes.

Otherwise I'm getting
another partner.

Okay, that's fine.

Okay, I'll be right there.

Bye.

Joel, I'm coming for you.

No, no, no.
What?

No, we're just gonna
take a nap really fast.

Up here?

And then we're
gonna go home.

Yeah?

-Oh, look at those douches.
-Okay.

-Douche!
-Oh, God, Zara.

-Douche!
-No, Zara.

You're good.

Sorry, sorry, sorry.

-He's looking at me.
-Okay, come here.

Give me your hand.

-Woman, give me your hand.
-Okay, okay.

Come on.

-Ooh.
-Come on.

Watch yourself.

Steps, one, two.

There you go.

How did
you get your phones?

Zara.

Come on.

Let's get you to bed.

I don't want a roommate
who eats my toothbrush.

I want you.

I know, that's what
I'm working on, okay?

-Okay.
-Okay.

-Eden?
-Yeah.

I love you.

Love you.

Just gonna rest a little bit.

-You're my best friend.
-You're my best friend.

I'll be back.

-Forever and ever.
-I know.

Love you.

Love you.

Oh, there we go, there we go.

-Yeah.
-Great.

You gonna drink that?

Oh.

Let's go.

Let's go!

Fuck yeah, bro.

Make this cup, I'll
make sure my dad

writes you that
recommendation letter.

Really?

Okay, okay.

Shake on it.

Okay.

Yes!

Deal's a deal.

Deal's a deal.

You're killing me.

-You're killing me.
-Yes.

Okay, I'm gonna go check on
my friend, no take-backs!

Hey, guys.

Just chilling with my
girl, we're cuddling.

Zara, wake up.

What are you doing in here?

Nothing.

I was making sure she was okay.

-Okay, Gooch, leave.
-Yeah.

-Yeah.
-Get out!

I'm going. I'm sorry.

Hey, Zara?

Hey.

Zara, you need to wake up.

Zara!

No.

Hey, Zara.

Oh, hey,
can I come back--

No, Gooch, please.

Leave, get out.

Get out!

<i>Pass her back,</i>

<i>Share the wealth,</i>

<i>You recognize her?</i>

<i>Get in the car.</i>

Oh, shit.

Shit.

Hey, Zara.

Hey, Zara, I need
you to get up.

I need you to get up and help
me find a charger, please?

Zara.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Mind if we come in?

Zara actually
isn't feeling good,

so I don't think she'd like
people to see her like this.

Right.

Yeah.

Well, Gooch forgot something,

so if we could just come in.

What'd you forget, Gooch?

Like, I left in...

His phone.

He left
his phone in there.

Just trying to get it.

Got it, okay.

I actually think I saw it.

I'll just grab
it really quick.

No, that's fine.

No, I'll bring it to you guys.

It's fine.

She locked the door.

Shit, shit, shit!

Will you calm down?

It's not like she's
got the passcode.

I don't have a passcode.

What the hell is
wrong with you?

You're fucking killing me.

I kept forgetting it, guys.

Who the fuck doesn't
have a passcode?

Eden.

You okay in there?

Yeah, yeah, I'm
just helping Zara.

Sorry, just gimme a second.

How about I come in there
and grab the phone, okay?

Schroder, do your parents
have a charger in here?

Did the phone die or something?

I just wanna charge
it up so I can

call my dad to
come pick us up.

Yes.

Yes, I think that's
a wonderful idea.

Come on out, we'll
give you your phone

so you can call your dad.

I don't wanna leave
Zara in here by herself,

so why don't you just

give me the phone charger
under the door.

I can help.
Let me help.

-I can help.
-No.

I think you've done enough.

Yeah, that'd be a little
weird though, right?

To give you a charger
when you could just

come out here and
get your phone.

Schroder, I saw the video.

What?

Stop.

Stop.

Come on now.

Mm.

What, uh...

What video?

I saw you with
Melissa on Friday.

I thought you said
the phone died.

It did.

So you didn't see
the whole video.

I saw enough of it.

Schroder, where is she?

The last time that
we saw Melissa Brown

is when we dropped
her off at her house.

I swear to God.

Okay, if that's the truth,
then give me a charger

and let me finish
watching the video.

I'm not sliding a charger
under the door, even though--

I'm not leaving this
room until you give me

a charger and I finish
watching the video.

I think you're gonna think
this is all really silly

once you see this video.

Why don't you come on out?

Charge up the phone,
give you your phone,

and then we'll all watch
the video together, okay?

How does that sound, Eden?

Is that good for you?

You wanna be reasonable,
give me a charger

in the next 30 seconds
or I'm gonna scream.

30.

29.

-What we fucking doing, man?
-28.

27!

26.

25.

24!

23.

22.

21.

Everyone!

Get the fuck out!

Get the fuck outta my house!

Zara.

Zara, come on, I
need you to wake up.

Please, Zara, please wake up.

Get the fuck outta here!

Get the fuck out of my house!

Zara, come on.

Come on, I need you to wake up.

-Get outta here!
-Shit!

Go on, get out!

Go on, come on!

Wait!
Wait!

Hey, please wait!

Hey!

Wait, wait!

No!

Schroder?

Schroder?

Schroder?

No.

Fuck!

She broke my
fucking nose, man!

Hey.

Keep your
fucking voice down.

Look what you've done.

Look what you've done, Gooch.

Go downstairs.

Get cleaned up, now.

'Cause you wanna help, right?

You wanna help?

Then fucking go!

Now!

Don't get blood on my carpet.

Fuck.

Is this really
your smartest idea?

Good point.

You do it.

No way.

I hurt my shoulder, I'm done.

Oh, Kendra,

you'd like, perpetrate
this door like so easy.

Of course I could.

But I'm not risking my athletic
career for this bullshit.

Athletic career?

Let's be clear on
something, all right?

No one's gonna remember shit
about either one of you two

if they see this video.

If they see this video, it's
fucking over, all right?

Get up and knock this
fucking door down.

No, man, I'm pretty
fucked up, I can't.

I want you to think about
your father's face...

When he finds out that
you're part of all of this.

Think about how disappointed

he's going to be
when he realizes

he was right.

Oh.

You're exactly the fuck-up
he always thought you'd be.

I'm fucking empty, dude.

Move out the way.

Get up, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

Get up, get up, get up.

Listen.

Look at me, look
at me, look at me.

I need you to go
around, all right?

I need you to get the ladder
and get the phone, okay?

All right?

I need you to do this for me.

I need you.

I need <i>you.</i>

Make me proud, all right?

Come on.

You good?

-You good?
-Yeah.

I believe in you.

Get that shit.

Eden!

Yo, Eden, what
the fuck is this?

Hey, Schroder?

Schroder!

I would stop banging
on that, dude, like,

this thing looks
really expensive.

-What the fuck!
-Fuck!

Zara, Zara.

Thank God you're awake.

I don't feel so good.

Zara, get up, get
up, come help me, please.

Zara, please get up.

Zara, get the fuck up!

Oh, shit, man!

God dammit, that
thing's too heavy.

We're not getting in.

We're not trying to get in.

Gooch, what are you
doing out there?

Okay.

Hey, Zara.

Hey.

Hey.

I threw up, don't--

-You what?
-I threw up.

Your drink.

Here, sit down, sit down.

Okay.

Oh.

You okay?

-What happened?
-Why are you here?

I gotta do something.

Just say hi to
Eden really fast.

Okay?

Oh yeah, okay.

You go and rest.

Oh, why?

Ok,
ok, stop! Shroder!

It'll be okay.

I will be right back.

Okay.

Eden!

Hey, Eden.

Look.
Let us in!

I'm really sorry
about all this.

Just please gimme
the phone back.

How'd you get it here?

I don't want anyone
else to get hurt, okay?

Please give the phone back.
No.

And all this can be over.
No.

Come on, Eden.
No.

Give the fucking phone back!

-Stay the fuck away.
-Come on!

-Stay back!
-Give me it back!

Fuck!

Fucking phone.

Just give me back
the fucking phone

and this can all be over!

Where is it, Eden?!

Gooch?

What are you doing?

She won't gimme back my phone.

Zara.

You mean this phone?

Get it.

Shroder, I got it,
I got the phone!

Let go!

Let go! Shroder!

Oh, you
crazy fucking bitch!

Oh, she's
got the phone!

Fuck you.

Fucking bitch.

Fucking bitch!

What now, hmm?

Let's fucking go.

Oh hey, are you kids with
that party over on Northgate?

My daughter's there too,
I was just wondering

if it's still going on?

Nah, got broken
up, it's fucking lame.

Yeah, super boring.

Aww, shit, let's fucking go.

Let's
fucking go. This...

This is what I'm
talking about.

Zara,
Zara, come here.

I need you, I need you
to help me get his arms.

What?
Help me get his arms.

Help me get his arms!
Oh yeah!

Here we go. Fuck yes!

Woo!

What the
hell's going on?

Fucking door down!

Get him in the bathroom.

Shit.

Let's go.

Let's go!

Get him in the bathtub.

Go ahead, go ahead.

Hey, Schroder.

Fuck!

What now, hmm?

Eden!

Eden, what are we doing?

Yes, okay.
Eden, stop, stop!

-What the fuck?
-Come help me.

Do what?

That looked expensive.

No shit. Come here.

Hey.

What are you doing?

What does it
fucking look like?

-No.
-What?

You can't get a new door?

I don't want to spend my whole
weekend shopping for doors.

Let's make a deal, Eden.

Give me the phone
and I'll let you leave.

How's that?

Get up.

What the fuck?

What's going on
in there, Gooch?

Uh...

So, I'm in a tub and
she's got a hair dryer and...

Fuck, man, I think they're
gonna electrocute me!

Okay.

Let's think
on this, okay?

Let's breathe.

Let's calm down.

No, dude, no, please,
please, please.

Just get outta
here, guys, help me.

Are you seriously
crying right now?

Shut up.

Hey,
you're not a killer.

Okay?

You're just a scholarship kid--

Get the
fucking phone, Kendra!

Fine.

Yes.

I'm sending Kendra now.

Let's just not do
anything stupid, okay?

We don't want
anyone getting hurt.

Kendra, hurry!

Eden, stop.

Fine. It's fine, it's
fine, it's fine.

It's not fucking fine!

-It's not fucking fine!
-It's gonna be fine.

What the fuck?

Dude, we're not killers.

We're not fucking killers.

What the fuck are you doing?

We need to get the fuck
out of this bathroom.

How are we gonna get the
fuck outta this bathroom?

We're gonna figure it out.

I just
wanted to take her home.

I told Shroder but he
doesn't listen to me.

Listen, I need you
to tell me where she is.

He's never listened to me.

I need you to
tell me where Melissa is.

Wait.

This was all about Melissa?

If you want get out of this,

you have to give
him what he wants.

Just give him the phone back
and this can all be over.

How did he get in here?

He came in through the window.

Okay, okay, the window.

The window.

We're gonna go
through the window.

-What?!
-Okay.

No, no, no, no.

I need you to go
through the window.

Are you serious?

No way is that safe.

What if it slips?

Do you wanna get
asked instead, Zara?

That's our only option.

Listen to me,
listen to me, okay?

Please, I need you to go
through the window, okay?

Help me.

Help me!

Help me!

Fuck!

They cut the power.
They cut the power.

Zara, please.

Please, please, will you please

go through the window, please?

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

Okay.

Help me, Zara.

Help me please.

Oh god, I can't.

Yes you can, yes you can.

I'll be right behind you.

I need you to go down, I'm
gonna be right behind you, okay?

God, I can't.

I'll be right behind you.

-I'm sorry.
-I need you to go.

-Okay.
-Okay.

Oh my god.

Oh my god.

Zara, look at me, look at me.

It's okay, okay?

I need you to go.

You first.

Zara.

I'm coming, I promise,
I just can't go first!

Okay.

But your ass better
be right behind me.

Zara.

I'm so sorry.

You believe me right?

Right?

Gooch!

What's going on in there?

-Status update, now!
-Get out.

Right now.

Right now.

Go. Get out right now.

Gooch!

Kendra fell, they're
going out the window!

Zara, come on!

Oh.

Oh my god.

Please help, please help.

I'm really hurt.

Hey, do you have a phone?
I'm really hurt!

Do you have a phone?

I'm sorry, sorry.

Hey, hey.

Hey, what's your code?

What's your passcode?

Five-eight, oh-two

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Eden, I can't, I'm
sorry, I can't, I can't.

Eden!

Eden!

I got you, I got you!

Where you going?

We're going the wrong way.

You're going the, fuck, oh god.

No, no, no, no.

Schroder.

Get my phone. Get my phone.

-No.
-We gotta call someone.

We're not getting your phone.

We're not calling anyone.

We're not calling anyone until
we can Gooch's phone, okay?

Fuck the phone, man!

Do you see me?

-You fucking see me?
-Shh.

Okay, look--

I'm gonna fucking die.

Here, here.

That's not gonna do shit.

No, hold it there,
hold it there.

I'm gonna die.

You're not gonna die.

I don't
want your pills.

You're
in a lot of pain,

this is gonna help you, okay?

I don't want
your fucking pills.

God dammit.

I don't want your pills,
man, I don't want your pills.

Fucking-- I don't
want your pills.

Look at me.

I'm gonna die.

After all we've been through
you can't leave me like this.

You can't leave me like
this, you're my best friend.

Please.

-Stop fucking crying, okay!
-Fuck off!

Oh, shit!

Fuck!

You can't
leave me, man.

I'm gonna die.

You're my best friend, man.

I have to get that phone.

No, fuck the phone.

No, no.

Oh, fuck.

You can't leave me, you can't.

No, Schro, Schro!

Best friend.

And then the phone died.

So all you saw was Melissa
getting in Schroder's car.

Zara, are you not listening?

They were with her the
night that she disappeared.

So?

That doesn't prove anything.

It proves that they
lied to the cops

and that they
know where she is.

You don't know that for sure.

My god.

-Are you serious?
-Look.

If this is what
you think it is,

we're not getting out until
we give them that phone.

I know.

That's why this is
going to the police.

No, we have to give
it back to them.

Look, we can tell
the police ourselves,

but right now we need to
get the fuck out of here.

Zara, his dad is
a congressman.

So?

So?

Can you think about
that, for a second?

Who are we?

You really think anyone's
gonna believe us over them?

This is the only chance
we have to help find her.

We have to take
this to the police.

Eden.

Give me the phone.

Give me the phone.

No.

-No!
-Give me the phone!

-Zara!
-Give me the phone!

Zara!

Hello?

-Zara.
-Let go!

Fuck, Zara.

No!

Zara.

Ow!

Eden?

Please, Zara!

Eden, stop!

Give it to me!

Eden!

You up there, sweetheart?

Fuck!

Please.

Zara, please, that is
the only proof we have.

I don't care about proof.

I wanna go home!

Eden?

Dad?

Is that you, sweetheart?

Oh my god, Dad, what
are you doing here?

What the hell happened here?

No!

No!

Eden, run!

No!

Get the fuck off me.

It's over!

Now it's my turn to count.

You've got 10 seconds to
give me back that phone.

Schroder, stop!

I split your daddy's
head wide open!

Ten!

Nine!

Sweetheart, just give
him his phone, all right?

Eight!

Stop, stop, stop!
Seven!

I have it, Schroder!

Bring it to me.

Now!

Six!

Got it!
Five!

Fuck.

You.

You know, Eden, I don't
think I'm gonna invite you

to any more of my parties.

Barrett Theodore Schroder.

What's going on here?
Dad.

I didn't think you were
gonna be home until Sunday.

Well, your mother
wasn't feeling well.

You need to explain everything
that's happening now.

Right now.

Yes.

Well, you see, me and
some of my friends

were just having
little get-together,

and things got out of
hand, but I've got it all

under control now,
everything's cool,

it's all cool,
everything's cool.

No, everything is definitely
not cool, young man.

I just think we all need
to take a deep breath.

Are you fucking shitting me?

It's her fault.

She started all of this.

She stole Gooch's phone and...

Her fault?

Her fault?
Yes.

When I walked into
this mad house,

you were chasing my
daughter around with an ax!

Mr. Murphy.

I'm happy we have this
opportunity to talk this over.

Talk?

You better start
explaining a few things,

or I'm gonna go talk
to the cops, all right?

Oh.

Not necessary.

How did this get so out
of control, Barrett?

I was just trying to
protect you, that's all.

I know this is a big year with
the election and everything,

and I just didn't--

The only person he's been
trying to protect is himself.

I've seen the video.

Dad, don't listen to her--

Did you know he has
a video on his phone?

Dad--

Of Melissa Brown being
forced into his car

the night that
she disappeared?

Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

What's this got
to do with that?

What?

Gooch, Gooch, come on,
talk to my parents.

Tell them the truth.
You know what happened.

What happened, Schroder?

Tell them.

It is your phone, Gooch.

Gooch?

Why don't you just
tell us what's on it?

Why don't you?

Tell them.

Fucking tell them.

Fucking pussy, goddamn.

Why don't you find
a charger for that?

Watch the video yourselves.

Good luck getting
into Penbrook, bitch.

Oh, excuse me?

-Did you-
-Barrett.

Excuse me?

Did you not hear him?

He said, "good luck getting
into Penbrook, bitch."

Okay, well that's not the
way we're raising this house,

is it, Barrett?!

You respect women in this house.

You have to apologize.

Apologize?

For what?

Apologize!

Barrett.

I'm sorry, Mom.

Not to me, asshole.

I'm sorry, Eden.

Thank you.
Un-fucking-believable.

Excuse me.

So.

What exactly did you see, Eden?

She didn't see shit.

I saw enough to
know that your son

and Gooch and Kendra are
hiding something massive.

Oh.

Hiding
something massive.

And uh...

Where is Kendra?

Kendra.

Kendra!

No.

Hey.

Son.

What?

-Dad?
-I'm here.

Let's call
her an ambulance.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Need to
call an ambulance.

Will you
say something to your son?

What do you want me to say?

Do you want me to say
it's all gonna be okay?

That this little mess
up of his is acceptable?

Did you want me to
feel sorry for him?

I just want you tell
me how to fix it.

You amaze me.

After all these years, you
still haven't figured it out.

No matter what anybody says,
they're only going to do

what's best for them.

Not this one.

She's different.

Nah, you just think she is.

Hmm.

Darling, thank you.

I'd like to begin by
apologizing to each of you

for everything that my
son did this evening.

Barrett knows better. I
don't know quite how

everything got
so out of control.

That is not how our
family handles things.

Thank you.

Mr. Murphy.

You own a a septic
tank company?

Yeah.

Is that a good--

well sure it is,
everybody shits.

Do you know, the county
is accepting bids

for the new
municipal contracts.

I think in order to make
amends for this evening,

my husband would be
more than willing

to talk to his
friends on the board,

if that's something that
you would be interested in?

And do I understand
that you have

a scholarship to
Penbrook in the fall?

Well, that's impressive.

Unfortunately, a lot
of those scholarships

don't cover all the costs.

Oh.

Oh my husband and
I love supporting

underprivileged students.

So this might help me
feel like you're on

a little more equal footing
with the other students

next year.

And that way you
can focus on your studies

instead of all these annoying
financial distractions.

Ah, true.

Oh.
I know.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Huh.
Yeah.

You can't just buy us off.

Oh, well. I think we just--

We're not doing that at all.

The character that
you've shown tonight

is just express that
you are the exact kind

of bright young woman
that belongs at Penbrook.

Oh, yes.

If you wanted to
go to that school,

that wouldn't be
a problem at all.

Couple of phone calls.

But we would to have to
have our agreement in place.

Sure.

-Eden.
-What?

Don't.

We can't make any
decisions until we see

what else is on that phone.

It doesn't matter.

What do you mean?

Miss, your
friend is right.

No matter what you do,
it is not going to change

what transpired.

That municipal contract.

It's a big deal, right?

We have been trying
to get one for years.

How much is it worth?

We wouldn't have to worry
about money anymore.

And your dad could
finally afford his surgery.

You wouldn't have to watch
him limp around every day.

Penbrook is all we have talked
about since we were kids.

I know.

And I need you there
with me next year.

We can't let them
get away with this.

My son, I assure you, will
be dealt with appropriately.

You have my word.

You're on my side, right?

I mean, you, you have to
think about Melissa's family.

-What about your family?
-Zara.

It's your
decision, sweetheart.

We're not making a deal
until we watch that video.

<i>Schro.</i>

<i>Look at her, dude,</i>
<i>you're fucking scaring</i>

<i>the shit out of her.</i>

<i>Can we just let her go home?</i>

<i>Fuck, shut up!</i>

<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

<i>Dude, you're drunk.</i>
<i>You're fucking drunk.</i>

<i>Bro, you're</i>
<i>gonna fucking hit her!</i>

<i>Fuck this bitch.</i>

<i>Dude, no, don't...</i>

<i>Dude, no.</i>

<i>Bro, get</i>
<i>your hand off the wheel.</i>

<i>Schroder, please</i>
<i>just fucking pull over...</i>

<i>You gotta</i>
<i>chill out, man.</i>

before you do
something fucking stupid.

<i>Hey, hey watch out!</i>

<i>What the fuck?!</i>
<i>- What the fuck?!</i>

<i>Holy shit!</i>

<i>Schroder, what</i>
<i>the fuck was that?!</i>

<i>Oh, shit.</i>

<i>You just</i>
<i>fucking ran over her!</i>

<i>Fucking shit, bro!</i>

<i>What the fuck!</i>

<i>Shit.</i>

<i>Shit.</i>

That's what I was
trying to save you.

You're too young to make
a decision that difficult.

It's not really that
hard of a decision.

We're gonna leave and I'm
taking the phone with me.

Let's go.

Barrett.

Where do
you think you're going?

Back your ass up, son.

-Zara.
-I don't feel so good.

I think they've done
something to us.

Barrett, Barrett, Barrett.

Hey, come on.

Come on.

Come on.

Think about it, Eden.

Would you rather
four years in prison

or four years in the
college of your dreams?

Prison? What's
he talking about?

It doesn't
matter, come on.

These girls are responsible
for a young woman's death.

Kendra's dead?

Unfortunately.

But it
wasn't our fault.

It was self-defense.

Well, I'm sure that's what
your lawyer will argue,

but it might be a little
bit difficult finding one.

I know every prosecutor,
DA, and judge in the county,

and I'll see to it that you
serve the maximum sentence.

Kendra's dead.

This is all your fault.

Go get that phone, okay?

Get it yourself.

Come on.

Zara.

Dad?
I got it.

-Dad?
-I got it.

No, no, no.

Dad, she's getting away.

Barrett.

Oh.

You didn't really think
that I would let you

hurt my family, did you?

Hey.

There you are.

It's okay.

What did you do?

Lorazepam and propofol.

At high enough
doses, it induces you

into temporary paralysis.

Trust me, I know.

My parents used to slip
it in my food and drink

when I was a kid.

I wanted to tell the police.

But Mother wouldn't have it.

You don't have to do this.

I do.

You don't.

Don't cry.

Please, you don't
have to do this.

It's okay.

It's okay.

Come on, son.

Get outta the car.

Schroder.

No.

Gooch.

Put Kendra in the trunk.

Why?

Because she's
got a hole in her

and it deserves
an explanation.

I can't.

I'm sorry?

Gooch?

Well, you wouldn't
have to if you didn't

shoot your little film.

Go on with it.

Come on.

Do you know, Eden...

You'd have done really,
really good at Penbrook.

I should know.

I was a scholarship
girl myself.

Please.

Night night.

Come on!

Dad?

Dad.

Eden, this isn't the way.

We need to go to the police.

We will.

<i>Less than one hour ago, a</i>
<i>car careened off Winslow Road</i>

<i>and plunged into Tillery River.</i>

<i>Authorities have recovered three</i>
<i>bodies from inside the car,</i>

<i>a man and two teenagers.</i>

<i>Warning, some of these</i>
<i>images are distressing.</i>

<i>A police correspondent</i>
<i>called the deaths, quote,</i>

<i>"unfortunate."</i>

<i>Preliminary findings</i>
<i>had attributed this</i>

<i>to an alcohol related incident,</i>

<i>but as you can see</i>
<i>behind me, this is still</i>

<i>a very active scene.</i>

<i>What was at first</i>
<i>deemed an accident</i>

<i>now looks like there's</i>
<i>some suspicious activity</i>

<i>involving stab wounds</i>
<i>onto the bodies,</i>

<i>indicating some</i>
<i>degree of foul play.</i>

Hello, angel.

Mom.

Get the fuck outta my
car, you fucking bitch!

I'm gonna fucking kill you.

Fuck you, Eden!

School's gonna be
real weird on Monday.

No, no.

Asshole.

Oh my god.

It's okay.

It's okay, it's okay.

Yeah, yeah.

Okay.

Okay.

You're killing me.

I'm gonna get you home, okay?

-Okay.
-Okay.

Okay.
