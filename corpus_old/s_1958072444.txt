                Is that my case?

        It is.

            That one is yours.

                It's not to be
                taken lightly.

            In fact,
            I was kind of hoping

    he would show up himself.

Well, that's the thing
about Mr. Voight.

He never does anything he can
get someone else to do for him.

    [classical piano music
    playing]

            [chattering]

            Enjoying yourself?

Um, yeah, this, uh--

this place is incredible.

            What's your name?

Joey. Joseph.

My friends call me Joey.

                Then so will I.

                I am Serena.

So, um, you know this guy,
Voight?

    Working for him, actually.

        No shit?

                No shit.

            I'm sure he would
            love to meet you.

            There's a place at
            the end of the hall.

                Double doors.

            Be there in ten.

            Hello?

                Serena?

        Beautiful, isn't it?

Mr. Voight, I--
There was, um--

There was a woman and I--
I just--

    I'm-- I'm sorry.

            Don't apologize.
            You can hold it.

    Just answer the question.

Oh, uh, yeah, it's--
it's really nice.

    What is it?

                It's, uh--

    It's a puzzle. [chuckles]

    The only one of its kind.
    Forgotten, until now.

    And it's almost finished.

                Keep going.

    [clicking, snaps]

        [clicking]

            [snaps]

So if I solve it,
do I get a prize?

                    I do.

        [chuckles]

            [snaps]

    [gasps]

Wait, I think I got it.

            [gasps]

    [breathing shakily]

            [screams]


            Hey! Hey, anybody!

                [groans]

    [Joey] What's happening?

            I can't...

What the fuck did you do to me?

        [chain rattling]

            [grunts]

            [screams]

            [grunting, groaning]

            [chain rattling]
            [Joey groaning]

[Joey gasping,
screaming, crying]

            [screaming,
            crying continues]

    I am a penitent...

        of the Leviathan.

    Grant me this audience.

    [screaming continues]

        Grant me this boon.

    [screaming continues]

        [moaning, panting]

    Harder. Harder.

                Are you sure?
    Yeah. More.

Wait, wait, wait.
                    What?

    Turn me around.

Okay. Okay. Go.
                        Here?

            Right here?
Yeah, go, go, go.

        [both moaning]

    How's this speed? Good?

        Mmm-hmm.

                You like that?

Yeah. I love it.

            I love you.

            What?

    Wait, what?
                        What?

        Ah, okay, I shouldn't
        have said that.

Yeah. No, it's fine.

            I got caught
            in the moment.
It's fine, Trevor.

        I just think maybe we--
                Jesus Christ.

Hi.
You guys were making food?

        Yes, Nora made tapas.

            Oh.

            So, is this, uh--
            This is him?

Uh, this is Trevor.

    Uh, you told them about me?
Okay, just a little bit.

                    Okay. Hey.
        Hey.

                    How are you?
        Good.

This is my brother, Matt
and this is his boyfriend,
Colin.

            Hey.
            Hey.

    Nora, the roommate.
    Sit, there's plenty.

            Ah, sit.

    Uh, yeah, I should go.

I've got a lot of
paintings to deliver.

        It's basically, uh,
        a work day for me.
        [Riley] No problem.

                    Cool.

        I'll get my jacket.

    Uh, great to meet you guys.

            Enjoy dinner. Bye.

            [door opens, closes]

You guys just heard us fucking?
            [all] Yes.

    [indistinct TV chatter]

        [dishes clattering]

        Just say it, Matt.

            I don't like him.

You're just intimidated
'cause he's a pretty boy.

What kind of guy
hooks up with someone from
a 12-step program, honestly?

What?
Is that supposed to be a stab?

    Riley, it's not like that.
    My concern is you.

    How you're gonna handle it
    when he's relapsing.

You've been sober for months.
What, almost half a year?

        Yeah. [scoffs]

Don't take away all my vices.

    I can fuck a cute guy,
    for Christ's sake.

        Did you really
        just turn down the TV
        to listen to us argue?

    No.
No.

            God, no one takes me
            seriously here.

That's because you do it
enough for everyone.

            Yeah, well,
            someone's got to.

        The first of the month
        is coming up real fast.

    I can't keep covering you.

I know that!
Nobody is asking you to!

Tips have been shit lately.

        I'm trying!
                        Okay.

                Ry, I love you.

        I want you to have fun.

        I'm not out here
        trying to police
        your every life choice.

You just want to make sure
that I can handle myself?
Right?

Message received.
I won't see him.

    [Riley] Here's the thing.

        He's not wrong.
        That's the problem.

        He's not wrong,
        and he means well

and that makes me want to
fucking strangle him.

    I'll bet.
    I'll swing on him for ya.

            [pinball machine]
            <i> Game over.</i>
            Whatever.

    I don't need him to be proud
    of me or anything.

    It'd just be a little nice
    if he wasn't ashamed.

    Just let it go.
    We're not doing that.

                What the fuck
                are we doing?

        We are, um--

We're being lonely together.

    Why, you got
    somewhere better to be?

Yeah, I should be
looking for a job.

        You've got a job.

No, I'm-- I know.
I mean... a better job.

I'm really tired
of being broke.

            [clicks tongue]
        What?

                        What?

        Forget it.

    Your brother wouldn't
    like it, so...

Okay, well, he also
would not like me being here.

            Can't hurt him
            if he doesn't know.

    Oh, okay, right, yeah,
    but see, it, uh--
    it hurts you.

You might not be a good girl,
Riley,

    but you wanna be.

    You got a little Matt,
    just kind of
    sitting on your shoulder,

so he may be worth listening to.

        You know? Maybe?

            Hmm.

        [Trevor chuckles]

    Now you can tell me.

    There's nothing to tell.

                Tell me, Trevor.

                    Hey, stop.

            Hey, hey, come on.
            Hey.

        All right,
        all right, all right.

    Tell me.
                        [groans]

                Um, okay, um,

    so you know how
    I always make runs down
    to the warehouse district?

        Yeah.
    So, there's this one spot,

            that we used to
            drop stuff off at.

            Totally anonymous.

            Nobody's ever seen
            anyone in there.

    But, like, the shit
    they had coming in and out--

    it's like billionaire shit.

        So I pass it sometimes
        and I swear,
        it's abandoned.

            Totally abandoned,
            except for
            one last shipment.

So you wanna break in?

        Don't have to.
        I remember the key code.

                    [chuckles]

What's in the shipment?

                    Don't know.

Who does it belong to?

                I don't know.
                I mean, some--

            some rich asshole
            who's looking
            to make a profit.

    They're not gonna miss it.

                Give me a hand,
                I'll cut you in.

        You know what? I--
        Forget I said anything.

        Because, you know,
        you're trying to
        get your shit together.

    And I don't wanna get
    in the way of that, so...

    [sighs]

Shut up, Trevor.

        [thunder rumbling]


Point of no return.
You sure you wanna do this?

Yeah?

            [sniffs]

                Mmm.

        [gate opening]

            Let's go.

        [Trevor hoots]

        [exhales]

                Whoa.
        Shh.

                [exhales]

        [Trevor chuckles]

                [sighs] Okay.

                Let's see here.

    Okay.

        What do you think?

What do you mean, what do I--
Do you know the combination?

        Well, no, um,

                        I don't.

                    [grunts]

        [panting]

No chance you could get it
if I couldn't.
There's a trick to everything.

            Right. Yeah.

Let's see it.

        [Trevor chuckles] Hey.

                Let's see here.

                Can you get it?

            Can you get it open?

Goddamn.
Boxes within boxes.

                    Jesus!

    Okay.

                Is it open?

[latch clicks]

            [Trevor] Is that it?

            Fuck.

God, I thought there'd be, like,
a stack of bonds or some shit.

It's gotta be worth something.

        [Trevor]
        Let's hope so. Yeah.

        I'll take it
        if you don't want it.

    Yeah, yeah. Why don't you
    hold on to it for now?

I'll see if I can find
some kind of appraiser,

and we'll, uh--
we'll split whatever cash
we can get from it? Yeah?

                Okay.

<i>The tides were in their grave.</i>

    And the winds were withered

    and the clouds perished.

    of aid from them.

                    Shit.

                    Mmm.

                Shelley.

                Percy Shelley.

                No! Mary.

    Byron. [chuckles]
                    Fuck!

            Fucking Lord Byron.

    [door opens, slams]

    [sighs] She's fine.
    Leave her alone.

        [Riley grunts]
        [clattering]

Hey, do not fucking
leave this bed.

        [clattering continues]

                    Okay.

        [Colin sighs]

                [groans]

    [grunts]


            Missed you tonight.
            Where'd you go?

        Out.

                Drinking?

        Mm-mmm.

            Bullshit.
            You can't even
            take off your shoes.

It's-- It's dark in here.
I was-- I was trying
not to wake you up.

    [smacks lips]

Don't ask me questions
if you know
I can't answer them, Matt.

                Pills?

        No.

No, seriously. Nothing.
            Okay, let me see.

Christ, Matt.
I'm fucking clean!

    Hey, I worry about you, Ry.
    You gotta stick to this--
    Get out of my room!

        Riley, I'm not trying--

                I love you.

You love having
something to fix

so that you can feel
like a big success

in this shitty apartment.
                Okay.

I see what you're trying to do.

You don't know a thing
about what I'm trying to do.
I'm not--

    You know what?
    That's okay.
    Neither do I.

            Okay. You're drunk.

    Yeah! Are you jealous?

Are you scared?
                Sleep it off.

            And in the morning,
            pack your shit.

    You don't mean that.

        The hell I don't.

    Then say it.

Like you mean it.

    Get the fuck out!

            Get the fuck out!

        Like that? You happy?

            I don't know what's
            gonna happen to you!
            Ever!

        You wanna play games?
        You will lose, Riley.

                Pack your shit.
                Get the fuck
                out of my house.

    I thought you'd never ask!

                So long, Colin.

    Seriously, come back inside.
    It's just a bad night.

        Okay? You're just gonna
        regret this later.

                    [sighs]

                    Fuck!

        [breathing heavily]

            [sighs]

            [grunts]

            So what's your deal?

        [clicking]

            [chuckles]

                        Hmm.

            Shit.

        Did I break you?

        [clicking, snaps]

            [breathing heavily]

                        What?

        [clicking, snaps]

                [gasps]

                What?

                    Holy shit.

        What the fuck?

        [wind whistling]

    [metallic squeaking]

            [groans]

    [merry-go-round squeaking]

    [voice] That blade...

            [gasps]

    [voice]
    ...was meant... for you.

                Who's there?

    [Riley gasps]

            Come... with us.

            [gasps]

        What...

        [clicking]
        If not you...

            [gasping]

        ...bring us another.

        [snaps]

            No, no, don't--

            [gasps]

                [sighs]

What's up? Are you--
Are you having a bad dream?

                    Yeah.

            Yeah, I guess so.

    Just call her.

            She won't answer.

Wait, so you're leaving now?

                    Riley?

                    Ry?

            Hey, Ry!

                No, no, no. Hey.

        Come on. Hey.
        Hey, come on. Come on.

    Hey, what did you take?
    What did you take? Please!

        Ry! Ry! [shouts]

            Riley, thank God.
            Matt?

    Hey, hey. Yeah, I'm here.

                    Hey, hey.
            Your hand.

            Yeah, we're okay.
            No...

    Okay, come on. I got you.
    Okay, we're going down.

    [grunts] Okay, okay.

All right, you good?

I'm gonna rinse this off and
you're gonna stay awake, yeah?

    Stay awake!

                [grunts]

                    [panting]


            Huh?

    [high-pitched ringing]

    [breathing heavily]

        [groans]

        [puzzle box clicking]

        [Matt screaming]
        [chains rattling]

            Matt?

        Matt? Where--

        All right, look up.

        Did you
        take something tonight?

                Pills? Anything?

I don't remember.

            Did you mix anything
            with the alcohol?

I don't remember.

        [police radio chatter]

    [chattering]

[door opens, closes]

        There any luck?

            No. Any word?

                    No.

So, what now?
I mean what should we do?

    Should we...
    [Colin] I guess we wait.

    'Cause the cops
    can't do anything yet.

    They said a couple
    drops of blood
    on the sink isn't enough.

Apparently it m-might
not even be his.

        It's Matt's blood.

How do you know that, Riley?

        I told you,
        he cut himself on this.

What-- On that?
What-- What is that?
You didn't tell us about that.

        I don't know.
        I don't know.
        I didn't--

I was really fucked up, okay?

And I was in and out of it,
and I wasn't expecting
for Matt to just be there,

and the pills were kicking in.

        I was seeing things.

                What things?
I don't know.

    I don't know.
    It was just
    crazy, fucked-up shit.

    You wanted me to tell you.
    I'm telling you...
    Yeah, tell me about Matt.

    What he said, what he did.
                        I am.

        He-- He woke me up,
        his hand was bleeding.

He went into the bathroom
and then he never came out.

You never saw him come out.
                            No.

But you just said that
you were in and out of it,

fucking blitzed,
so what did you miss, huh?

Because he wouldn't just leave.
That's not him!

I know. I know. I know that.

So fucking think, Riley!
Please!

        I'm-- I'm trying.

I told you not to leave.

    Riley.
    No, I just need a minute.

    [door opens, closes]

        [sobbing]

    [sniffles, exhales]

        [knocks on door]

Riley.

    Whoa.

Hey.
What are you doing here?

        Kiss me.
    Hey.

What happened?

        [Riley moaning]

    [Riley screams]

            [Trevor] Hey, what?

                    [gasping]

Ry, what?
                There was a--

    What the fuck is happening?
    What is happening?
    What, what?

            Riley? What is it?
            What is it?

    I don't know.

    [sighs] Okay, um,
    how many did you take?
                    Three.

Same stuff?
    Yeah, it's the same shit.

    It's never made me
    full-on hallucinate before.

I'm not on anything right now.
Why the fuck am I
seeing shit still?

I know, I know.
That's why we're laying
all this out, okay?

    [sniffs]

How did you get it to change
from the cube into that?

        I didn't.
        It changed on its own.

    [clears throat]
                    Look.

                It's a puzzle.

        See, the pieces move.

    If you get 'em to
    lock into place,
    then you solve part of it.

            But now, it's like--

                It's... [sighs]

        It's on the next step
        for something.

                Here, you try.
    Fuck no.

                You believe me.

Yeah, of course.
I told you I don't
fuck with shit like that.

        Yeah, but you--
        you really believe me.

        What is this thing?
        Where did it come from?

I have no idea.

        So what about
        the shipping container?

            Whose shipping
            container is that?

I don't know, okay?
They never
showed up to claim it.

    So--
        And the building?
        Who owns the building?

        Well, can we find out?

            There has to be
            a name somewhere.

Riley, this feels
a little crazy.

    There are no other
    Serena Menakers.
    I just wanna talk to her.

            [knocking]
            [orderly]
            You have visitors.

[ventilator hissing]

        Serena?

Um--

Hi. I know you don't know us.

My name's Riley McKendry
and this is my friend Trevor,

and we actually have
a few questions

    that we wanted to ask you,
    if that's okay.

Maybe it's a bad time.

            Bad time? My lungs
            are rotting out.

            I'm fucking dying
            in this place.

            What's this about?

        A warehouse.

            You'd have to
            be more specific.

Your name was on the deed.

You had something shipped in?

It's still there.

        It wasn't shipped in.
        It was locked up.

            And it isn't mine.

    Well, can you tell us
    whose it is?

    How do you know about this?

            And why do you care?

            You have no idea
            whose business
            you've stepped in.

        Roland Voight was
        monstrous and sadistic.

            Roland Voight?

    Is that who you work for?

        I sorted out
        his mess of an estate.

    And that was the last thing
    I ever did for him.

            I'm not proud of
            the things I did.

            What you are after
            is dangerous.

    It ended Voight's life,
    and it will end yours too.

Or worse.
                Fuck this.

Fuck, Riley.

    Let's go. Come on.

            Riley?

Riley, let's go.

Is this what
you're talking about?

        Who opened this?

        This is not
        the first configuration.

                Who touched it?

        My brother.

    And now he's gone, isn't he?

            So you've seen them?

Roland used to see them, too.

    People thought he was crazy.

        Angels, he called them.

            You'd think a devil
            would know a devil.

                [coughing]

        Let's go.
                        No.

            [coughing]
            Give me some water.

        Trevor, go get it.
        Okay.

[coughing continues]

        I'm taking this back
        for your own good.

        Hey, why don't--
        why don't you
        put that down?

            I'm locking it up.

I'm sorry. I've got
nothing else for you.
                What?

        Come on, give it to me.
        Give it to me. Serena!

No, no.
    Serena, please give it back.

    Let go. You don't know
    what you're doing.
    Give it back!

[Serena screams]

Ow!

            [gasps]

[breathing heavily, wheezing]

    [Trevor] What happened?

            What happened?

It's okay.
I did it to myself.

        [panting]

            What the fuck
            happened in there?
        I don't know.

She-- The-- The thing
was on the table
and then she picked it up.

That proves coming here
was a bad idea, right?
    What are you talking about?

        She said that he's gone?
        How would she know that?
        How would she know that?

    Slow down. Slow down.
                How could she--

    Let's just unpack
    everything, all right?

This is a lot to process here.

    We're not in a fucking
    meeting, Trevor.
    [sighs]

        [Trevor] I'm sorry for
        trying to fucking help.

                [engine starts]

    [puzzle box clicking]

            [wheezing]

    [orderly]
    Hey, she's feeling faint.
    She cut herself pretty bad.

            [nurse] The doctor
            just stepped out.

                        Okay.
        Let me check.
        Maybe she's still here.

    She's with a patient.

            [chattering]

        [coughing]

        [rumbling, creaking]

                        Hello?

        [gasps]

        [entity wheezes]

            [Cenobite wheezes]

            [Serena panting]

        [clangs]
        [air hissing]

                [wheezing]

[Serena coughing]

            [panting]

        [chains rattling]

    [Cenobite snarling]

            [wheezing]

            [Cenobite chuckling]

            [crying]

        I'm sorry.

        [sobbing] I'm sorry.

    I'm sorry
    for what I have done.

Have mercy.

                        Save...

            your breath...

            for screaming.

    Trevor.
    Hey, come here.
                Hey.

I just found so much weird shit
about this Voight guy.

All sorts of fucked up
sex stuff. Accusations of
money laundering, too.

And then six years ago,
he just disappears.

Nobody knows what--

What? What's wrong?

    Um, the lawyer's gone too.

What? What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
                        Menaker.

    I called because I was
    worried about her hand...
    Oh, God.

            ...and they said
            she wasn't there.

    She was in the infirmary,
    and then she wasn't,

and no one saw her leave, so...

        Fuck.
                    Yeah, fuck!

    We need to get rid of that
    thing, Riley. All right?

            What are you doing?
First my brother,
and then Serena Menaker.

Same exact shit,
six years ago.

Look. In the weeks leading up to
Voight's disappearance,
there were others too.

There was a groundskeeper,
there was a sex worker,

and there were probably ones
that nobody even knew about,

and they're all
loosely connected to him
and his estate.

And they're all fucking gone.
They're all gone.

It's happening again.
I know that this guy
has something to do with it

and I know that
that thing does too.

It opens up and it--
it cuts you.

And then, when it does, you--

        [sighs]

We have to go there.

To his estate.
It's not that far.

        [phone buzzing]

[Riley sighs]
            You gonna get that?

    Yeah. [clears throat]

        Hey, Colin, what's up?

            Hey, what's up?
            How, uh--
            Where are you?

    I'm hanging out
    at Trevor's for now.

<i>Okay, where is--</i>
<i>where is his place?</i>
<i>I'll come get you.</i>

        No, that's okay.
        I'm doing stuff.

        We're all doing stuff,
        okay?

    Like, but we should be
    doing this shit together,

    'cause I don't know
    what the hell to do here.

    <i> That's the fucked-up</i>
    <i> part of all this shit--</i>
    <i> like, Matt would.</i>

        Yeah, he would.

    <i> Okay, so I'll come get you.</i>

                <i> Riley?</i>

                    [sighs]

    Trevor! Trevor! Trevor,
    what the fuck are you--

                Trevor!
I'm tossing this thing,
all right?

No one's gonna know
the difference.
            The difference is,

        I need it to find Matt.
        Don't you get that?

    Can we at least talk
    about it, please?

Talk about it?
You don't wanna talk about it.
That's why you fucking took it!

    I thought you believed me!
Well, I do. I do!

I do believe you, Riley!

All right?
            And I thought that
            I could trust you!

[gate opens]

            [sighs]

    [doorknob rattles]

            Whoa.

                [doors creak]

        [gasps]

            Hello?

    [metallic rattling]

    [electricity humming]

        [sighs]

        "Cenobite."

    [Matt whispers]<i> Riley.</i>

    [Riley breathing heavily]

                Matt?

        [Matt] Riley?

            Matt?

        [Matt] Help me.

            Where are you?

            [Matt] Riley!
            Matt!

            [gasps]

        [gasps]

        Matt?

Is it really you?

        Do you want it to be?

    Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
    I'm so sorry.

    I'm so sorry.
    I'm so sorry.

                [Matt whispers]
                Bring me back.

    [screams]

            Riley, Riley, Riley,
            it's me.

            It's Colin. It's me.

        I-- I don't understand.

It's okay, sweetie.
We're here.

            What-- What the fuck
            is going on?

and came to find you.

                How?
and we heard you screaming.

Figured you needed some help.

        Help? I don't need help.
        Help with what?

        We're just here
        to bring you home.
        No, I'm not going home.

        I'm here for a reason.
        I'm not going home.

    Could you give us a second?

Seriously? Riley--

        [Nora] Leave it.
        [Trevor] What?

on this, dude.

    We'll be upstairs.
    So glad you're okay.

        Riley?
        [Nora] Come on.
        Come upstairs.


            [sighs]

    [Trevor] Does someone
    even live in this place?

    I mean, what is this?

        Right? What are we
        even doing here, okay?

        Let's just grab Riley,

    and just get the hell out,
    all right? Shit.
    [clattering]

            Hey, chill.
                        Fuck.

It isn't the first time
we've had to track her down.
Just give her some space.

                Space. Yeah.

            All right.
            Might as well see
            what they got left.

    Um, shady.

Bingo. [exhales]

All right,
what's your pleasure, ma'am?

            We don't drink
            when Riley's around.

        Right, right.

                [sighs]

Um, okay. I'm gonna--

    I'm gonna find a bathroom
    real quick.

                Sure.

    [exhales]

                    Um,

            what is this place?

        I don't know.

        A fuck dungeon?

    What, do-- do you wanna
    tell me what this is about?

    [classical music playing]
    Fuck! Shh! Sorry!

    [Nora] Sorry. Sorry.

        [sighs]

            Gosh.

[switch clicks]

[switch clicks]

        [switch clicks]

the puzzle box,

            it has six sides,
            six configurations,

        there are three left,
        and then it says,

        "whoever possess
        the final configuration

is granted a passage
to another realm."

To an audience with God.

Riley, since when
do you believe in God?

    What I'm trying to get to
    is that this god,
    whatever it is,

offers choices to whoever holds
the final configuration.

        Get there,
        then you choose
        your ultimate desire.

Life, knowledge, love,

sensation, power, resurrection.

        You see where I'm going?

No, I don't, actually, um--

                        Matt.

            What if this
            brings him back?

Okay, Riley, um,

let's just close this up
and get out of here.
                        No, no.

    [conversation continues,
    faint]

            Colin?

    [door creaks, slams]
    Shit! Fuck.

            Trevor?

            Trevor?

            [banging on door]

    Nora?
    Jesus Christ, you scared me.
    Why did you shut the door?

You called my name,
I came back.

How the hell did you--
        Get me out of here.

    There's a-- There's a panel
    behind the bar.
    One of the switches.

Okay, okay.
Uh, hold tight, all right?

Okay, yes, Riley, this is a lot.
I know, but I was in
the playground when it happened.

It's a lot and I get it.
I get it, okay?
I saw the thing cut his hand.

I'm not questioning you.
I'm just questioning this.

            The box, you have to
            get it to change.

You have to mark a sacrifice.

And then they come to collect.

            That's how
            you get your prize.

Here, look.

Wait, where's the--
where's the box?

                I don't have it.

    Have you found it?
    Yeah, w-- which switch?

            Try all of them.

All right, all right,
all right.

    [classical music playing]

    [puzzle box clicking,
    snaps]

Fuck. Anything?
            [Nora] No!

    Have you found-- [grunts]

            [screaming]

        [screams echoing]

        [whimpering]

        Nora! Nora!

            [screams]

            No! No, no! No.

    [Riley] Oh, my God!

        Nora, hey.
        Hey, are you okay?

Are you okay? What happened?

        My back.

What the fuck is that?
What-- What the fuck is that?

        Okay, I'm-- I'm
        gonna pull it off.
        No, no, no!

        [Nora groans]
        [gasps]

    [Riley]
    There's a knife in that!

    [Colin] Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

I'm gonna try to apply pressure.
Oh, shit.

What happened? What happened?
I don't-- I don't know.
We were just in the other room.

    Fine. Help me
    get her up then.
    [Riley] Oh, my God.

There was a man in the walls.

What did she say?
I don't know. She's out of it.
I don't know.

We need to leave.
We need to call an ambulance.

    We need to leave now!
    We don't know
    what we're dealing with.

We need to get out of here.
She's in danger!
Get her up off the floor. Go!

            Fuck.

            We have to go now.
I'll load you up in the back.
All right? Come on.

            Nora?

You're gonna be okay.

                I hear bells.

What? What did she say?


    [Riley] It's happening.

    Riley, you coming with us,
    or you following behind?

    Yeah, let's get
    the fuck out of here.

        I'm coming.
                    All right.

    Hurry, go, go, go.

            [tires squeal]


Nora, hey.
Stay with me, babe.

    Come on, keep your eyes
    open for me, okay?

        [Trevor] Shit.


        [Trevor] Come on,
        come on, come on!

        [Riley] Trevor.

            Oh, shit!

    [puzzle box clicking]

What is that? What is it doing?
It's changing. I don't know.

What do you mean
you don't know?

    I don't know. I don't know.
    Changing into what?

            Where's the turn?
            We missed it.

No, the main road's left.
                No, it's not.
                I was just here.

Yeah, so were we.
All right? I--

    Fuck.

        [tires screech]

                        Go, go.
I'm going. I'm going.

            The road's blocked.

    No, we're not.
                        Go back!

        Yes, we're going
        the wrong way!

    [overlapping shouting

    Oh, God, please, God.

Our Father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

        What is it you pray for?

                What... is it...
                you pray for?

        Salvation.

        What would it feel like?

                A joyful note?

                Without change?

                Without end?

                        Heaven?

                There's no music
                in that.


Please! [groans]

            [groans]

        [screaming]

                Oh, but this.

        [strained scream]

There is so much more
the body can be made to feel.

        [groans]

        And you'll feel it all
        before we're through.

            [screams]

    [gnashing]

        [Nora groaning]

        [gasps] Nora!

            [screams]

    Nora! What the fuck?
    Holy shit.

        [engine revving]

        Hey.

            Nora!

            Nora!

            Nora.

        [all panting]

            No.

            [sighs]

You were right.
We should have thrown it away.
I shouldn't--

You shouldn't be here right now.
You guys shouldn't be here.

        We came on our own.

No, you came because of me,
because this is my fault.

We don't have time for this,
okay?

I'm sorry, but we don't, okay?

We need to call the cops,
we need to let them search.
Okay?

Maybe they'll find her.
Who knows?

    They're not gonna find her.
    You know that!
Then they won't.

But I have no interest
in hanging around here
any longer, okay?

We have to get back
to the house.

        Fuck that house. What?

Listen, that's where
Riley's car is, okay?

    There is nothing good
    in that house, Trevor.

Okay, I understand that,
but we have to make
some decisions here.

Once we get there,
then we can talk about
what we wanna do next

or whose fault it is.

    [Colin] Do not fucking
    talk down to me, dude.

I'm not talking--
I'm trying to...
Do not talk down to me.

        [Riley panting]

[The Priest] Wait.

Not yet.

Accept the pain

you have wrought.

Greater delights await.

    We wish to see you proceed.

    I-- I didn't ask for this.

        But you did.

    [panting, whimpers]

    What-- What are you?

        Explorers in the further
        regions of experience,

            of sensation's rim.

        Our gifts are boundless.

    I don't want them.

                    Yes, you do.

                Our god awaits.

            You know
            what it can offer.

        Resurrection.

Your brother's ending
was exquisite.

                    What?

Would it bring you comfort
to see him again?

    [Trevor, Colin in distance]
    Riley! Riley!
    Where are you?

Two more and he is yours.

        Feed it.

        Their pain.

        Their blood.

Unlock the next configuration
and then the last.

        No. I've done enough.

        Enough

        is a myth.

            [clicks]

                [gasps]

                    [grunts]

                [whimpering]

We will not be denied.

        Your blood
        is in our hands now.

    Ours to claim at any time.

        But the box
        I leave in yours.

            If not you, another.

            Choose. Two more.

        [Trevor in distance]
        Riley, where are you?

Riley!

                Hey, hey, hey.
    [whimpering]

        Fuck.

    Oh, shit. Shit, babe.
    What'd-- What did you do?

It wasn't me. It wasn't me.
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

        Come on, come on.
        Hey, hey. It's okay.
        Let's just go.

        Let's just keep walking.
        Okay.

            Riley? Hey.

Are you good?
Are you okay?

Are you okay? [echoing]

Hey, look at me.

            I'm not gonna do it.

What?

        I'm not gonna harm you.

                    Wait a sec.

        [breathing heavily]

            [gnashing]

    [Colin]
    What the fuck is that?

            [Trevor] Come on,
            come on, come on.

Fuck are you doing?
Let's go! Come on!

                [grunting]

    Come on, Riley. Come on.

        [gasps, grunts]

        [gnashing]

    Colin, Colin, get up.
    Colin!

    Colin, get up!
    What are you doing?
    Come on, man!

    [Riley] Colin, get up!
    Get up!

        [whimpering] Oh, God.

            [panting]

            Oh, no.

                Oh, no.
                No, no, no, no!

    [shouts]

    [Trevor] Come on, come on!
                No.

        No, no, no, no.

        [crunches]
        [screams]

        [screaming, grunting]

    [gnashing]

            Riley! Fucking shit!

        Riley! Riley!
        Riley! [echoing]

    [Riley breathing heavily]

                Riley!

                [grunts]

            [screaming]

        Riley? [groaning]

    [grunts]

        [both gasp]

            [screams]

Fuck!

    [puzzle box clicking]

        [gate creaks]

Hey, guys,
they're coming again.

What do we do?

Riley?



        Come on, hurry.

                        Come on!
            Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

                    Holy shit.

                Come on. Get up.
                Get the fuck up!

            [Riley] Move!

            [grunting]
                [Riley] Hurry.

    Shit, shit, shit.
    Oh, my God.

He's bleeding a lot.
I-- I think he's going to
start going into-- into shock.

Wait, Riley.
Where the fuck are you going?

    [groans]
    Oh, what have we done, man?
    What the hell have we done?

    [metallic rattling]

            [Trevor] Holy shit.

What the fuck did you just do?

        I-- I hit the switch.


        [Riley] Trevor?
        Oh, fuck.

    Dude, we have to
    stop the bleeding,

    or-- or at least
    slow it down a little bit.

    [Trevor murmuring]
    Fuck. Okay,
    give me your belt.

                What?
Give me your fucking belt!

Come on.
            [groaning]

Oh, fuck.
                    Here you go.
                    Fucking--

One, two, three.

                [groans]

All right. Okay, okay.

Lie him down right here.
        Okay, yeah.

            Okay, get his legs.

                    [sighs]
    No, no... [murmuring]

        We, um-- We need to find
        something for his arm.

                    Um--
        That's a lot of blood.

These are strong.

You should hold on to them
in case he needs some later.

            Maybe, um, I could
            find something
            for your hand, too.

                Okay.
                Yeah.

            Thank you.
                    Yeah.

        [raspy breathing]

            [sighs]

Are they still there?

    Yep.

            Yeah,
            they're not moving.

It's the metal framework...
I think,

that runs along
the whole house.

It keeps them out.
            It keeps them out
            for how long?

        Trevor's not gonna last.

                    What are we
                    gonna do?

    You're gonna go.

You have to take Trevor and go.
            Go where?
            What do you-- What?

They have my blood.
You realize that, right?

It's me that
they're after.
                    Stop.

Unless I give them one of you
and I'm not going to.

I'm not losing
anyone else.
                Neither am I.

        [sighs]

    Besides, I don't really
    feel like taking my chances
    with those things.

        So what else you got?

        [Trevor sighs]

    [door opens]

    [mechanical ticking]

[footsteps approaching]

[ticking continues]

            Roland!

                [whispering]
                Hey, I'm sorry.
                I'm sorry.

        Listen, things got
        a little out of control.

    [device whirring, ticking]
                Okay? I know.
                I know it--

It's not exactly what was
supposed to happen, but listen.

    Shh! Shh!
                    No, listen.

[whirring, ticking stops]
[Roland sighs]

[Roland sighs]

All you had to do
was feed the box

and bring it back.

    I did. I did, Mr. Voight.

        I did. Okay? I--

            She was a mark.
            She was a mark.

            I brought her along,
            and she ran with it.

        I mean, it was supposed
        to take her, okay?
    Coward.

You should have
opened it yourself.
You should have made sure.

Okay, okay. It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter. All right?

        She got a little
        ahead of me. So what?

        [breathing heavily]

            So what?

        She found it on her own
        and she brought it here.

                        Right?

    Things took a turn.
    All right? I admit that.

        But I'm handling it.

            We're on track.
            We're one
            configuration away.

    You're almost there.

        [device turns on]

            [gasps]

        [groans]

        [groaning]

        [grunts]

        Then finish it.

[device whirring, ticking]

    It's finishing itself.
    Just be patient.

        [growls]
                [groans]

"Patient"?
Every second is a lifetime.

            [groaning]

    Get it out of me.

            [groaning continues]

    [clicks, snaps]

    [clicks, snaps]

                [Riley exhales]

                [puzzle box
                clicks, snaps]

    [clicks, snaps]

            Oh, fuck.

            [breathing heavily]

It worked on the big one.
We have to assume that
it's gonna work on another.

            Okay, so you
            want to let one in?
Yes, I know. Just one, though.

We let one in. We lure it in.
We shut the thing behind it.

    And then I stab it.

                You're awake.

    What's going on?

Riley has a plan.

            You good to move?


[breathing heavily]

I don't guess I can
get you to reconsider?

            No, you can't get me
            to do anything.

        Even when I want you to.
        [chuckles]

                        [sighs]

                Do it.

    [metallic rattling]


I don't know about this.

I'm going out there.

                    Ry.

            Take me.

    Take me like you took them.

            [Cenobite wheezing]

took my brother.

Taken?

        We set them free.

        Release yourself.

    [breathing heavily]

        [moaning, wheezing]

            Now. Go!

            [wheezing]

        Col, why did you...
        Shh.

    [groaning, wheezing]

        [grunts]

            [wheezing continues]

                [grunts]

            [wheezing, grunting]


    [inhales, wheezes]

                [wheezing]

    [wheezing continues]

Be careful.

            [roaring]

        [Riley screams]
        The switch, the switch!

        [grunting]

            [Riley grunts]

    [Colin] Riley? Riley!

                Colin!
    [Colin] You good?

        [grunting]

        What's happening?

            [Riley] I'm okay.
        Okay.

        [breathing heavily]

[snarling, groaning]

        What's it doing?

            I think it's stuck!
Just kill the fucking thing.

    I can't.
    I don't have the box.
    I dropped it when I fell.

    [Colin] Okay, let me in.
    Let me in!

                Where is it?
It's on the floor to your left.
That's where I fell.

I ran into the thing.

            Okay.

        [Riley] Please hurry.

        I don't see it.

    [Riley]
    Okay, it's just right there,
    on the ground.

                Um, I'm not
                seeing anything,
                Riley.

I don't know where else
it would be.
I dropped it right there.

    I can't find it.
            What do you mean,
            you can't find it?

    It's not on the floor.
    I'm not seeing it anywhere.

            Oh, shit!

            Colin! Colin!
        [blade stabs]

                No!
        What the fuck?

                    [grunts]

            [Riley] Colin!

                [gasps] No.

You didn't have to do that!

The blade
would have taken them!

        Does it matter?

    The Cenobites will come,
    just like I want them to.

            [groans]

        Oh, my God.
        That's Roland Voight.

            Trevor, that's him.

In the flesh.

Such as it is.

But then he already knew that.
Didn't you, Trevor?

        [exhales]

            [Riley] You knew?

            You knew!

    You knew. You put that thing
    in my hands and you knew.

    How could you do that?
    Why would you do that?

        I'm sorry.

            Oh, my God.
            [sobbing]

        How could you do that?
He was just doing what
I paid him to.

And he will continue
to do so... [chuckles]

...because this is the best deal
of his miserable life.

            [ticking]

            [device clicks]
        [groaning]

[Voight groaning]
    What is that?
    What the fuck is happening?

    Isn't it obvious?

    I claimed my reward.

    [Roland]<i> I had experienced</i>
    <i> everything afforded to man,</i>

    <i> and still I wanted more.</i>

        <i> I chose liminal.</i>

    <i> I chose sensation.</i>

    [ticking, whirring]


    <i> But the Cenobites,</i>

    <i> their tastes were not</i>
    <i> what I imagined.</i>

    <i> They preyed on my nerves,</i>

        <i> pulling them</i>
        <i> in random cycles,</i>

    <i> stopping just enough...</i>

            [groans]

    <i> ...so I could never</i>
    <i> grow numb.</i>

    I don't know what
    they promised you.

Knowledge? Love?

    I sought pleasure.

But all they have to give...

            is pain.

It's a trick.

All of it.

        [clicks, snaps]


                Don't.

        Trevor,
        what are you doing, man?

    [Voight] Letting them in.

[Riley sobbing] No, don't.

    [metallic rattling]

                    Colin.

            What?

            Colin, go.
        I can't.

        Get up! You have to go!

        Colin, get up! I can't
        help you from here!

            You have to get up
            and go!

                Listen to me!
            Okay.

            They're gonna come!

        You have to go!
        The gate's open! Hurry!

            Go!

        [Colin grunting]

            [Voight] Watch him.
    Colin, Colin, Colin.

It's over, man.
It's over.

                    [Voight]
                    Go. Get up!

        We need him close by.

    [blood pattering on glass]

        Yes. Take it.

    I give you their blood,

        their suffering.

                Come and get it,
                you bastard.

            I'm still here,

    [shouting]
    and I demand an audience!

    [thunder rumbling]

        [Trevor] Colin!

        Colin, it's over.

        Go back to the room,
        'cause they're coming.

We're already here.

            [gasping]

            [Cenobite wheezes]

            [Cenobite wheezes]

        [device clicking]

                    [sniffs]

            [clears throat] No.

            Your chains
            can't reach me here.

        Tell your god
        I've got its disciples,
        its priest.

    What did you think I built,
    a fortress?

                I built a cage!

            And I'm not letting
            any of you go

            until it makes me
            right again.

    You reject our gift.

            Fuck your gift.
            Fuck you!

        Now take it out of me!

    Remarkable, all this.

        All for us.

        No, not for you. For me.
        I get what I want.

[The Priest] Then let us in
to address your displeasure.

[breathing heavily]

        What are you doing?
Isn't it obvious?

        Wait! [grunts]

                [groaning]

                    [groans]

            [Cenobite wheezing]

        T-- Take it back.

        Just take it back.
        I don't want it anymore.


[grunting, breathing heavily]

            [screams, cries]

            Colin?

            Colin!

    [screaming, crying]

            [screaming]

            Stop!

        Just take it out of me.
        I don't want it anymore.

        Just-- Just let me die.
        I'm begging you. Just...

                Just...

                Just let me die.
There is no retreat.

    Once a threshold
    has been crossed,

all you can do is search
for greater thresholds.

                [Colin grunting]

Not him. I never chose him.

        And yet he is chosen.

                        Marked.

Gifts can not be ungiven.

Only exchanges
can be made.

I was told that
the box is in my hands.
If not me, another.

Right?

Not him.
            Riley,
            what are you doing?

Perhaps you prefer...

            Another.

        Anything
        is better than this.

Perhaps we were wrong

about you.

You've never sought sensation.

    Your whole life,

every conquest,

all your pleasures
lie in... power.

            Power.

For your efforts,

we offer
the Leviathan Configuration.

        Riley, Riley, hold on.
        Hold on, hold on.

            I tried to stop you.

                    Remember?

                        Yeah?

        Just put
        the fucking thing down.

            Just put the fucking
            thing down, okay?
        Mmm.

                Give it to me.

            [groans]
    [Riley panting]

            [Riley quivering]

            [grunts]

[device whirring, ticking]
        [Voight groaning]

    [breathing heavily]

            [grunting]

                [gasping]

    [heartbeat thumping]

        [grunting, gasping]

    [heartbeat continues]

            [gasps]

Our power lies in dominance,

in the sovereignty of anguish.

        [laughing]

                [groans]

            [gasping]

And now,
it will be yours to wield.

                    [grunting]

            [gasping]

            [gasps]

        [choking]

            [groaning]

            No.

[The Priest]
You will know our finest gift.

    No.
                Oh, yes.

            We have such sights
            to show you.

    [Trevor screaming]

[both crying]

        Go.
                No.

I'll be fine, okay?

    Just finish it.

            [sighs]

[The Priest]
Lament. Lore.

Lauderant. Liminal.

    Lazarus.

    Leviathan.

    What would you ask
    of us?

        [Matt] Riley.

    Riley, look at me.

        Take my hand.

        Take me home.

                No.

    I've seen your rewards.
    I know my brother's gone.

        I don't want anything
        from you.

                        Nothing.

    Then you have chosen...

        A life of regret.

Knowing everything
you've done,

everyone you've
hurt and lost.

        Your suffering
        has barely begun.

    You choose to live.

To carry that weight.

Bitter and brief.

    You have chosen
    the Lament Configuration.

        [car door shuts]

    What just happened in there?

        I made a choice.

It was the right one.

Right?

    [The Priest]
    <i> Roland, it's time.</i>

            [gasps]

            [gasping]

        [gasping]

        [breathing heavily]

            [wailing]

    [groaning, screaming]

        [screaming stops]
