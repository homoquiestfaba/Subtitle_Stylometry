What's taking you so long?

I just wanted you to fix the leak.

Look, lady, to fix the leak

I need to find the leak.

(material ripping)

Hold on.

You find the leak?


I found something.

Okay, I'm ready up here.

Hang on a minute.

Okay, I'm there.

Can you confirm it's human?

Medicarpal, phalanges...

No question about it.

Hold on, Nick.

There's got to be an easier way.

When a body decomposes
in concrete

it leaves an air pocket,
vacuum-sealed.

If we do this right, it'll open
like a jar of pickles.

Ten bucks says the owner
sells the house.

By law, you've got
to disclose everything...

three bedrooms,
two baths, and a skeleton.

Okay, I'm late again.

Nick's going to work with me on that
unidentified body at Summercliff.

I hear it's just bones?
What a rush.

O.I.S. At the Jockey Club.

Officer-involved shooting.

I'll take a piece of that.

Good, I want you to double up.

Listen, these deals
are never easy

so keep me informed, please.

Will do.
I drive.

Picture that.

So what do you have for me?

I could use a rush.

Well, this qualifies, 4-26.

But I can't give you the case.

Because?

Conflict of interest.

The alleged rape victim's
an exotic dancer.

Because I used to be one,
I'll be biased?

No.

The suspect's your ex-husband.

He's asking for you,
but you can't take it.

Just let me do the prelim.

All right.

Do what you can.

But after the preliminary,
you pass it off, okay?

Thank God you're here.

Eddie.

I didn't rape that girl.

According to the police report
she's telling a different story.

I wonder what the rape kit's
going to say.

We had sex, okay?

But she was there with me 100%.

In the parking lot
behind the club.

Well, some women like
the outdoors.

Melanie know about this?

Mel and I split up a while ago.

You might want to call her
anyway.

She can loan you the money
for an attorney.

You're not going to help me?

Cath, I am in a jam here!

A detective from Sex Crime's
been assigned.

I'm going to place another CSI.

What about Lindsey?

What about her?

You want her spending Sunday
afternoons with me

at Nevada State Prison,
or the mall?

Based on the auricular surface

I'd say she died
when she was about 20.

She?

It's in the hips.

The pelvic bone is
definitely female.

You know, for a ladies' man

you don't know much
about bone structure.

I know all I need to know.

I figure she was killed

before her cement bath.

Yeah, how?

She was stabbed

at least a dozen times

a screwdriver maybe

or a spike.

No, the gouges on her ribs
are unusual.

The instrument had to be...
slightly curved

with some kind of serrated edge.

Like crocodile teeth.

Whatever killed this girl

it was not a traditional weapon.

Well, stabbings are personal.

She knew her attacker.

That's the rule.

Who are you?

Sara Sidle, Warrick Brown

Officer Joe Tyner.

Hi.

Hi.

Officer Tyner.

How are you doing?

Tell us what happened
here tonight.

He responded to shots fired

the suspect fled the scene.

Why don't you tell us
what happened here.

(tires squealing)

Unit Five. I'm in pursuit
of the fleeing 413

heading southbound on the Strip.

(tires squealing)

Get back into the car!

Drop your keys to the ground!

Put your hands on the wheel!

I didn't do it!

Whatever you think I did!

I'm looking at three strikes.

I'm not going back.

I'll show you my registration.

No, put your hands on the wheel!

(fires gun)

Then he turned

the weapon on himself

and one shot,
right through the forehead.

Where's his gun?

I left it in the jeep.

I'm going to go bag it.

Officer, we're going to need
your weapon as well.

I never fired.

Drawn but not fired.

It's just standard procedure.

It's okay. It's all right.

We're going to need
to seal off this lot.

Tyner told you
what happened here.

Whose side are you on?

The officer told me

a fleeing suspect
committed suicide.

I'm just verifying his account.

You know how this works, Brass.

Can we clear the jeep
so I can do my job?

Well, at least test the dead
guy's hands for gun residue.

At that proximity

G.S.R.'s invalid.

They'd both be covered,
no matter who fired.

Can we get back to work?

Yeah.

(light buzzing)

(door opens)

You brought the foundation
of the house to our lab.

It's a six-by-three-foot
section.

When the concrete dried

it preserved a partial
impression of our Jane Doe.

Did you find out anything
about the house?

I pulled the permits.

Summercliff was built five years
ago on nothing but desert.

That would explain
why the body was so desiccated.

House was sold
subsequent to completion

so the homeowner isn't a suspect.

Homicide is running
a missing persons check.

(clears throat)

Well, if it wasn't
for a leaky pipe

she might have been down there
forever.

I think our killer
was counting on that.

Hey.

Why would a guy speed it
all the way down the Strip

just to pull over
and cap himself?

What are you
getting at, Warrick?

Officer's weapon,
Smith and Wesson 5906.

Standard issue.

One bullet missing.

Nothing standard about that.

Brass isn't going to like this.

I don't give a damn
what Brass likes.

Like I do?

If Tyner's dirty, he goes down.

I just know what happens
when you piss off the P.D.

Yeah, it's war.

Gil Grissom?

Or should I call you
Spider Man?

It's harmless.

Of course it is.

Orange-kneed tarantula.

Nice specimen.

The tarantula's touch
is very gentle.

It leaves no prints.

They move without a trace.

May I?

Maybe I should introduce myself.

Teri Miller does not need
an introduction.

I need you to make me a face.

I didn't kill him.
That's what I told IA.

It's what I told my superior.
It's what I'm telling you.

Officer Tyner, your gun... there's
a bullet's missing from the magazine.

I don't top off.

I know it's against regulation,
but the 14th bullet

puts pressure on the spring
and the gun can jam.

Can anyone confirm your story?

It's not a story!

And no...

I don't tell people
how I carry. Do you?

Check the other magazines.

What the hell's going on here?

We're just having a talk
with Officer Tyner here.

Next time, don't start without me.
I'm the union rep on this one.

Then you should know.
Tyner's magazine... one bullet shy.

Is the expended round
still missing?

It's not in the body,
bullet's a round point

wound was a through-and-through.

I did not fire a single round.

And with a record like yours

we're supposed
to just take your word?

Five civilian complaints...

three for excessive force.

Two IA investigations.

I was cleared.

I'm sure you were.

What is that supposed to mean?
I don't have to take this crap!

Tyner... sit down, sit down.

What you do need
is for these guys

to go out and find
the missing bullet.

So what are you waiting for?

I guess it's a good thing
I sealed off that crime scene.

It's like a human Jell-O mold.

The impression's only a partial.

It's not going to be easy.

They told me you were the top
forensic artist in the country.

And Canada. I didn't
say I couldn't do it.

Give me your hand.

You'll enjoy this.

It's as much science as art.

It doesn't really
look like anything.

No light, no shadows.

No shadows, no perspective.

Now look.

So teach me.

Okay.

First I'm finishing off
the plaster mold.

We can't give her life
with only half a face.

Although not
actually symmetrical

most faces appear that way

and the thin layer of slip

makes the plaster and clay
appear seamless.

Her cheekbones and nasal spine

indicate Nordic descent.

I've seen a few
Norwegian brunettes

but your girl's
probably a blonde.

Brown eyes?

I thought you decided
she was Nordic.

But in this country, brown
is a dominant eye color

and more importantly,
brown photographs better.

You want to get her face
out there, don't you?

Yeah.

I'm sure someone needs closure

and somebody else
needs to go to jail.

There she is.

As we first reported yesterday

the remains of an unidentified
Caucasian female

were unearthed in Summercliff.

The 5'4" woman was
approximately 20 years old.

Here you go.

Authorities are asking
for the public's help

in identifying the victim.

If you have any information

please call
the Las Vegas P.D. Hotline.

Hotlines... hit or miss.

I don't know. In my experience

people usually remember
a beautiful woman.

Uh, Nick, weren't you going to go

and do the, uh... at the...?

Yeah.

Yeah, okay, I'll do that.

So I saw Eddie.

He actually... seemed scared.

Did that make you happy?

Um, no.

I'm not really sure what I feel.

You're not still in love
with Eddie?

Catherine, you have
to hand off the case.

Warrick can just double up.

Uh, Grissom,
Dr. Robbins wants to see you.

Something about your skeleton.

Okay.

You have to pass off the case.

If you compromise
the investigation

there's no going back.

You could hurt Eddie

just as much
as you could help him.

Hey. I've already seen
the marks on the ribs.

Uh-huh, but did you see

the hairline fracture
on the posterior skull?

No.

Easy to miss, but it
screams blunt-force trauma.

Also, the middle ear
has three bones.

They're dusted with sodium

and lodged against the malleus

I found a tiny ball of earwax
with grains of sand.

Salt and sand.

Killed at the beach?

Not ruling it out.

Grissom.

Hey, Doc.

Hotline's lit up.

Five callers all ID'd

the same woman

and her mother just confirmed.

I need to know what happened
to my daughter.

We're trying to figure that
out for you.

She was quite an athlete, huh?

Mm-hmm, yeah.

Did she scuba dive?

She'd just been certified.

Did, uh, Fay

before she disappeared,
go on any vacation

go diving or spend
time at the beach?

No, not that I recall.

And she, uh

lived here with you
until she disappeared?

No, she had just moved

in with her boyfriend,
Jason Hendler.

He still lives on Medley Place.

And the, uh

police interviewed him
after she disappeared?

A couple of times.

He had nothing to do with this.

Well, how do you know that?

He loved my daughter.

He was good to her.

Did they... ever fight?

The first few months of
a relationship nobody fights.

She was crazy about him.


I've given Eddie Willows
20 lap dances.

He never got rough
till last night.

In the parking lot.

Yeah, he asked me
to go for drinks

you know,
but out in the parking lot

he starts kissing on me

and I kind
of laughed it off, but...

then he grabbed me

and he slams me against the wall

and... that pig.

Hi, Evans

I'm sorry I'm late.

I'm Catherine...

just Catherine.

I'm a forensic scientist.

Scientist, wow,
you look so normal.

Thanks.

Catherine, you sure want...?

Yeah.

Are those bruises
from last night?

Yeah, a guy pinned me
against a wall.

Sexual assault nurse
collect a kit yet?

She just finished.

Why don't you see
if you can catch her.

I'd like her to get a sample
from under her fingernails.

Uh... what kind of sample?

Anything that might, uh,
show up from a... a struggle.

You'd think what that nurse took
down below would be enough.

The weird thing is...

I liked the guy.

It's not here.

Bullets just don't disappear.

Excuse me.

No one's allowed inside the tape.

I saw what happened.

Have you talked to the police?

Police make me nervous.

You guys aren't cops, are you?

We're crime scene investigators.

We need to know what you saw.

I was kind of taking a break,
hanging out in a PT Cruiser.

I was laid back in the heated
driver's seat when I heard the siren.

(siren blaring)

Put your hands on the wheel!

I didn't do it!

Whatever you think I did!

Man, I'm looking at three strikes.
I'm not going back.

Just let me show you
my registration.

No! Hands on the wheel!

And just like that,
the officer fired?

Just like that.

Missing bullet, eyewitness...

we better tell Grissom
we got a war.

I heard about your eyewitness.

A valet who joyrides.

He sounds reliable.

So, uh, how's the thing going

on Eddie Willows?

What thing?

The thing that

I told Catherine

to pass off to you.

Oh, good, um...

We just put some stuff
through the lab.

Get hold of the DMV?

I was just about to.

Warrick? Why would
you call the DMV

on a rape charge?

Okay, I didn't hand it off.

Really?

I'm sorry, Warrick.

If you want me to suave anyone,
I've got to know the shot.

I know. I'm sorry.

I'm doing this for Lindsey.

You so much as breathe on the
evidence, it's contaminated

and I end up the bad guy.

Eyes, no hands.

What's the status?

Skin samples from under
the woman's fingernails

are consistent with Ed's.

I saw some bruises

but Eddie's style
has always been very...

involved...

vigorous.

Vigorous?

She's trying to tell you
Eddie likes it rough.

Thank you, Warrick.

Eddie said that
she was into it.

He said, she said?

It's about the evidence,
Catherine.

And you may not like
where it takes you.

So how many grains of sand

in the ocean, huh?

I don't care about the ocean,
just the sand in my skeleton.

Can you pinpoint a beach?

I don't know.

I might have to do
some field research.

Hey, you think Grissom
would send me to Hawaii?

Why don't you ask him yourself?

Ask me what?

Oh, nothing, I, uh...

I was just telling
Nick about your sand.

Well, it's not sand.

It's not natural anyway.

Here, check this out.

Now, if this were natural sand,
the surface would be smooth.

Now this looks more
like Fremont Street

on a Saturday night...

rough.

Could the particles be
sediment from the concrete

where we found her?

No, no way.

I analyzed the mineral content.
It's feldspar and quartz.

That's crushed gray sandstone.

It's man-made,
in a rock crusher.

What does that mean?

It means she wasn't killed
in Hawaii.

Other than that...

he has no idea.

Is this payback, Warrick?
Is that what this is?

I was tough on you,
so Officer Tyner takes my heat?

That's how you think I work?

Brass, this has nothing
to do with anything.

The D.A. Has filed charges

and on the testimony of
a bleary-eyed car jockey

who was 40 feet from the jeep.

Eyewitness is a bonus:
Your cop's magazine

was one bullet shy.

That's you CSls,
always counting bullets.

What's he doing here?

You show up with your latex gloves
and your little fancy metal boxes

and your little powders...

You have no idea what it's like
to put your life on the line

every day!

Oh, you mean dealing
with punk-ass cops who hide

behind their union reps?

Hey!

You're just a psycho.

You don't deserve a badge.

Cut it out!

Not in my lab, pal.

Scientists!

I bet you've never
even drawn your weapon.

Yeah, I hope I never have to.

Nick, walk this guy
out the door.

Now, let's go.

Sara.

Yeah, come on, Warrick.

Let's cool down.

This is your fault, Gil.

Your nose is so
far down a microscope

you have no idea
what your people are doing.

Yeah, I know one thing:
My guys will not bend

and they will not
be intimidated.

Yeah, I sat in your chair.

Your guys have one job:
To find the evidence.

So where the hell
is the missing bullet?

Huh?

Eddie?

Catherine.

I'll take a root beer.

What are you doing here?

I knew you'd be here.

You got a routine:
Turkey club, no bacon.

You could be a detective.

Thank you.


Well, you obviously made bail.

Did you get a lawyer?

I got you and the truth.
Who needs a lawyer?

I came to tell you
how great you are.

It always comes out wrong.

When I married you, I married up.

I know that.

It wasn't all bad.

You think the bullet's
somewhere in the jeep.

It's not in the body.

It's not at the crime scene.

I like our odds.

Let's do it.

(wrench grinding)

(metal clanging)

We have searched every
single piece of metal.

I think hide and seek is over.


Yeah.

We've searched every
piece of metal.

Spare tire.

You've got to be kidding me.

The tire sucked up the bullet

and the treads covered its tracks.

We match the bullet to the cop's gun,
the case is airtight.

There's a match.

We got Tyner.

One bad cop going down.

Well, actually, Warrick, the evidence
round wasn't from the cop's gun.

It was from the suspect's.

No way.

(hard rock music)

These guys never give up
anything on their girls.

Well, let me give it a try.

Excuse me, sir.

Can we see your permits?

Oh, hi, gorgeous.

How are you?

Okay, Ted.

How are you doing?

I'm okay.
Hi.

You should've seen
this lady dance.

Was she good!

You still working with the cops?

Can't seem to get
off the night shift.

You dressed like that?

If you want to
call that dressed.

Yeah, Evans.

Hey, Ted, you heard
about this thing

with Eddie and April?

Yeah, the night guy
told me about it.

Boy, Eddie never changes, huh?

Bring back memories?

You mind if I look around?

Help yourself.

Thanks, Ted.

(doorbell rings)

Can I help you?

Ma'am, my name is Gil Grissom.
This is Nick Stokes.

Honey, who's out there?

Mr. Hendler, we're criminalists

from the Las Vegas
Police Department.

What's this about?

We're investigating

the disappearance of Fay Green.

May we come in?

Yes.

Thank you.

Did you find her?

Yes, I'm afraid we did.

She'd been dead for quite a while.

Hmm.

You always hope...

Mr. Hendler?

Would it be possible
for us to look around?

Fay only lived here for about
a month, five years ago.

I've got nothing to hide.

Thank you.

Thanks.

A trigger and a lionfish.

Yeah, that's right.

Interesting choices.

Violent, carnivorous predators.

(floor squeaks)

It's just a warped floorboard.

It's been like that forever.

Mr. Hendler, at any time,
was your fish tank over here?

Maybe, a while ago, why?

Did it ever overflow?

Or break?

Not that I recall.

You said I could
look anywhere, right?

Yeah.

Got a pocket knife?

What are you doing?

Pops out, pops in.

What do you find
inside an hourglass?

Mr. Hendler, I think
the tank was over here.

I think it broke.

I think you got water
and artificial sand

all over the place.

I'd like you fellows
to leave now, please.

Fine, we'll go.

We'll be back...

with a warrant.

So what did the rape kit say?

Nonoxynol-9,
polyvinyl alcohol, and...

Glycerin?

Yeah.

It's a contraceptive film.

What are you drinking?

Chamomile.

May I?
Sure.

Thank you.

So you used to work at
the French Palace, huh?

That's right.

My friends and I used to go there.
Really?

Payday Fridays.
Uh-huh.

Maybe I saw you perform?

Oh, I doubt it.

Why?

You would've remembered.

So, this film

it's kind of hard to detect

because it dissolves
with body heat.

And, as you know, Greg

sex can make a body pretty hot.

This stuff has to be inserted

15 minutes to three hours
before sex.

Which means that

April inserted the film

while she was still at work.

But how could she have known

to put the birth control in
before she was raped?

Exactly.

Guess where Jason Hendler
was employed five years ago?

Summercliff housing development.

A plumber, perhaps?

Close. A subcontractor.

How'd you know?

Why else would you be so excited?

Hey!

You weren't going to say

good-bye to me?

I'll meet you outside.

Thought I'd let you off easy.

But I did tack up my number

on your big fish corkboard...

Under "cold cases."

The ones that got away.

Let's hope not.

So, check it out...

the laser is the path
of the bullet.

If you were Officer Tyner

and you approached the suspect

from the driver's side
of the vehicle...

Vic was shot

in the frontal lobe

through the windshield.

There's no way I
could shoot the guy

from here and mimic
that trajectory.

The laws of physics
trump the eyewitness.

There's only one way
this could've gone down.

...show you my registration.

No! Put your hands on the wheel!


Officer Tyner
was telling the truth.

So I bet you think
I owe you one, huh?

We work. We get paid.

You don't owe me anything.

Fine with me.

He promised me a million things.

I got tired of him lying.

Like what, marriage, kids?

Music videos.

He kept telling me
he'd put me in one

but he never delivered.

And for that you
set him up for rape?


No, it wasn't supposed
to go this far, okay?

I got this friend
over at the Trop.

She got this high roller
on a rape charge.

He paid a ton
to make it go away.

Wait a minute. You think
that Eddie's got money?

He is in the music business.

He reps some bands Off-Strip.

No, I met a producer
friend of his from L.A.

And he's always throwing
money around this place.


What?

What's so funny?

Nothing.

Unless they're trying
to hide something?

I see you've cleaned house.
I thought you might.

I vacuumed up the sand.
Big deal.

Will you at least tell me
what you're doing here?

I'm working, sir.

Officer, would you hit
the lights, please?

You're getting my floor wet.

It's luminol, sir.
It dries quickly.

Surface is non-reactive.

I know what you're doing.
You're looking for blood.

My husband didn't do anything.

Why are you harassing him?

Let's try the ALS.

Why use the alternate light source

if the luminol didn't
pick up anything?

Luminol works on the surface

ALS chases the protein
molecules in blood.

It actually penetrates the wood.

These floorboards are
all made of maple.

High-end, but
they've been lacquered.

Who lacquers maple

Turn it off, Nick.

Officer, hit the lights, please.

Mr. Hendler

let me tell you
what I think happened to Fay.

On the night
of her disappearance

the two of you
got in a heated argument.

Don't you walk away from me!

Suffering a concussion,
Fay falls to the floor.

In the heat of the moment

you decide to make it final.

But Fay surprises you:
She fights back.

She pushes you off.
She crawls a few feet away

and you move in
for the final attack.

One thing that I don't know though

what did you use to kill her?

I didn't kill her.

Well, whatever the weapon

it wasn't a knife, but it worked.

You drove her body
over to Summercliff

where you were employed

the Summercliff job
less than a week.

Ask Amy; she worked
for the same contractor.

That's right.
He got a better job

in Reno.

Jason wasn't even in Vegas
when Fay disappeared.

Yeah, you painted the floors,
covered your tracks

for what, aesthetic reasons?

Five years is a long time

but eventually the past
catches up to everybody.

I didn't kill Fay!

I loved her. I still love her.

Amy, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

You still love her?

Officer, would you please

arrest Mr. Hendler?

Call my father.
He'll get a lawyer.

I'll ride along with the cops.

Bring Homicide up to speed.

This is now a fresh crime scene.

I'll get to work.

"...the instrument had
to be slightly curved

"with some kind of serrated edge

like crocodile teeth..."

Mrs. Hendler, do you and your
husband do much rock climbing?

(gun cocks)
Yes.

That's what I killed her with.

I can prove I was in Reno
when Fay disappeared.

I've got records.

You don't want to talk, fine.

But I've got a question for you.

Why do you care so much
about the floors?

I mean, Amy paints them
every spring.

It's no big deal.

Jason was in Reno.

I came here to tell Fay

that we would be
together again one day.

Mrs. Hendler, put the gun down.

Do you know he was engaged to me
when he met her?

Where are you going?

Stop it!

There was blood everywhere.

No one else could see it.

But I knew it was there.

A dead body is so heavy.

Mrs. Hendler,
I'm a good listener.

You've got to give me the gun.

I can't!

I'm sorry.

No, wait.

But you arrested my husband.

Wait!

Mrs. Hendler.

Nick, don't move.

Please.

I don't want to fire my gun
any more than you do.

For five years,

you've been washing
the blood off your hands.

Let's put down the guns.

You okay, Nick?

Yeah.

Come on.

Morning.

(bike bell rings)

Morning.

Please don't tell me

that you're in trouble
again already.

You weren't home.
I figured you'd be here.

Lindsey loves this park.

So, I thought I'd take you
out to breakfast.

Say thank you.

You're welcome.

I don't think that's
such a good idea, though.

Cath, when are we going to talk
about what happened between us?

What's to talk about?

You cheated on me.

I caught you.

I've got a new life.

Cath...

Come on...

why do you fight
the one thing we're good at?

Daddy!

Daddy!

There's my little girl.
