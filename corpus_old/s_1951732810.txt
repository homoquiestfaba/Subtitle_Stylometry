<i>We women have been
fighting for our rights</i>

<i>for way too long!</i>

<i>We have to start to speak louder
in order for our rights</i>

<i>to finally get heard
in the workplace.</i>

<i>Women are passed over
for promotion.</i>

They're passed over
for benefits.

They're passed over
for inclusion in the boardroom.

Or on Wall Street.

Today, only 10% of our
board of directors are women!

That is a crime
against women!

Today we love and respect
our elected legislator for women.

We women continue
to be used as objects.

<i>I wanna thank you
for coming out</i>

<i>and supporting our plight.</i>

Sensitivity
means so much to me.

Specially after what I went
through in my last relationship.

<i>...to be as successful
as any man on the planet.</i>

<i>And on top of that</i>

women's salary are 20%
less than men's.

Sir, would you come up
here, please?

Come on!
It's alright.

<i>We don't bite. Come on. Come on!</i>

Oh, oh!

Now, sir.

Women make 20% less
than you men do.

Please, tell all of us
that that is not an injustice.

<i>Yeah, come on,
tell us!</i>

I'd easily be willing to
give up 20% of my income

to be able to have
a multiple orgasm.

<i>Why do you worry
about work anyway?</i>

Just find yourself a man.

<i>Get him, girls!</i>

I'm starting to enjoy being
with you more and more.

Don't let that go
to your head.

The last thing I need is
another overprotective boyfriend

that gets jealous
at the drop of a hat.

I actually think you should
start seeing other guys.

Just to make sure that
I'm the best prospect.

Excuse me, gentlemen.

<i>Take a look at the beautiful
lady standing right there.</i>

<i>She's a single, natural blond that
loves aromatherapy and African art.</i>

If interested, come over and
schedule a date for next weekend.

Oh, and she's getting
a boob job next week.

And she's open to a threesome
if you find the right woman.

<i>Hey, I'm Nick!</i>

I'm Jeff.

I'm Christopher.

<i>This is really romantic.
Kidnapping me for the day?</i>

I'm so happy I finally have a
boyfriend whose sense of adventure

is more than just taking
the dog to the park.

Before I reveal the surprise,
I'd like to make a toast.

Here's to you.

In such a short time you've
opened up the door of my heart

by having me overcome my fears
of passion, devotion, commitment.

Fears I thought I'd
never be able to overcome.

I only hope that in time I can help
you overcome your fears as well.

Starting with
your fear of flying.

<i>Ándele, ándele!</i>

<i>Hola, señor.</i>

<i>Rápidamente!</i>

Mr. Fix It, Computer
Repair Shop. Please hold.

What seems to be
the problem.

She won't respond
to my commands anymore.

You know what
it sounds like to me?

Hey.
Ooh!

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Ooh, ah!

Bill Smith?
Mr. Fix it?

Lance Valenteen.

Have a seat, Bill.

So, did you love her?

Love-

Sophia?

Yes.

I'm sorry.

It was nice meeting you.

You know your way out.

But I love her.
I do.

Where did you touch her when she
wanted to forget about the world?

She loved
her head massaged.

<i>Where were her eyes the first
time you told her a secret?</i>

Hazing into mine.

First time
you saw her cry.

She lost her mother's
necklace. She's Italian-

You hurt.

I hurt her so bad.

It hurts like-
It's like-

Like only true love can.

Love.

Love that goes deeper
as the years progress.

Sorry, but I won't take a case
unless the client possesses true love.

Did you know
how I feel?

I found out a long time ago that
I was incapable of true love.

<i>Which gives me the unique
ability to help you out.</i>

<i>Research has shown that 88%
of the time a woman dumps a man</i>

<i>it's because
there's another guy.</i>

<i>Another guy we'll call
Different Dick.</i>

<i>Either she's dreaming about
him or she's already with him.</i>

<i>Sure, she may've
dumped you because-</i>

<i>He couldn't commit.</i>

<i>He was incredibly cheap.</i>

<i>He only loved himself.</i>

<i>He was hung like a South
American sand beetle.</i>

<i>But deep down inside, these women
are all saying the same thing.</i>

<i>I want a Different Dick.</i>

<i>Well, I give them just that.</i>

<i>Hi.
I'm Different Dick.</i>

<i>But I'm no ordinary
Different Dick.</i>

<i>I'm packed with information that allows
me to make you look like a better catch.</i>

<i>Get that shark
from Jaws!</i>

<i>First, we determine
why she left you.</i>

<i>Then I come up with a plan
on how to meet your ex...</i>

<i>...befriend her,
and date her!</i>

<i>Then, equipped with
knowledge provided by you</i>

<i>I turn from Different Dick
into your very own...</i>

<i>Mr. Fix It.</i>

<i>I become the epitome
of why you were dumped,</i>

<i>to prove that you really
weren't that bad after all.</i>

<i>I just didn't make Carol
laugh anymore.</i>

<i>How about this one?</i>

<i>What do you call a dinosaur
that's had sex with me?</i>

<i>A vagina-saurus.</i>

<i>Martha said
I was the jealous type.</i>

<i>If that guy hugs you
again like that,</i>

<i>I'm gonna break
his freaking jaw.</i>

<i>That's my brother.</i>

<i>I didn't know you were
from West Virginia.</i>

<i>Bonny said
I was inconsiderate.</i>

<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

<i>What the fu-</i>

<i>Now she thinks
I'm a laugh riot.</i>

<i>She hasn't yelled at me
in months.</i>

<i>I didn't have to change.</i>

<i>I'm still a hung
like a chestnut,</i>

<i>but after how
Mr. Fix It behaved,</i>

<i>well, at least
I can still get it up.</i>

<i>Thanks, Mr. Fix it.</i>

<i>Here's the rules.</i>

<i>I will not have sex
with your ex.</i>

<i>Contract will now and always
remain 100% confidential.</i>

<i>And there's a full refund
if there's no reconciliation.</i>

<i>No exceptions whatsoever.</i>

<i>Mr. Fix It Inc.</i>

But I don't know
why she left me!

Well, um, phew,
that, um-

That changes things.

<i>You know, I-</i>

I'll pay double.

Lance Valenteen,
who crashed in the final lap

of last year's
street car race,

comes back this year to win this
coveted event in record time.

After all these years,
he'll finally get a chance

to race on the professional race
car circuit. I'll tell you, Chuck,

tonight he's going to bang like
a bongo at a Santana concert.

Chuck?

Excuse me.
Chuck?

Hey, Chuck.

<i>Excuse me.</i>

Excuse me.
Lance?

I said I'd pay double.

Hello?

Mr. Fix it?

You're going down.

You're going down!

These are the guys
that won it all last year.

Yeah. The tall guy
likes it down low.

The son a bitch
is always late.

Okay.

I'm gonna take a leap of faith
and say, "We're gonna win. "

<i>Who's with me?</i>

<i>Dude, seriously, joining
this league was your idea,</i>

and you still
can't show up on time.

I was in a meeting.

We had to discuss
fixing an Internet connection.

<i>Email access.</i>

<i>Wireless,</i>

homeless, boneless...

...chicken?

A little responsibility.
That's all I ask.

Could you please just act like
a grown up for one night a week?

So guys, huh?
Next week at 7:00 sharp.

We're a team.

Yeah.
Alright.

See you, guys.
Ow!

Good game. A lot of fun. Sharp.

"Wireless, homeless,
boneless chicken"?

You know as well as I do. If their
wives find out about Mr. Fix It,

I'll never be able
to see them again.

You gonna have to stop this
lying and start being yourself.

Tonight's not that night. I got
a new client I gotta scope out.

The exploration stage.
Then I can go.

You can go, but the client
personality evaluation

reveals low self-esteem, boring
tendencies, and multiple insecurities.

So she's homely
and fat.

I'm in.

<i>The client found a note in his ex's
pocketbook saying, "Go on at 8:00."</i>

Giggles.
Comedy club, huh?

Yeah.

I hope she's funny.

That must suck.

I know.
It must suck getting old.

Staying young
is the secret to life.

Yeah. Right now the secret
to life is not waiting.

Come on!
Let's get Giggles going!

<i>Starting off amateur night,
here's Sophia.</i>

Do not talk.

Then how does one
become your friend?

Either make me laugh
or make me orgasm.

What if I can do both?

Then you will be
my very good friend.

<i>Alright, put your hands
together for Sophia.</i>

<i>Now it's time for Cherry.</i>

I can tell tha-

Do not follow me
another step,

or I will tie you down,
remove your clothes,

and make you nice
and comfortable.

Do you know that bouncer
over there?

He will pluck out each one of your
genital hairs with boiling tweezers

while wearing a blindfold.

I wonder what you have to do
to be her best friend.

<i>Um, she-</i>

<i>She loves her dog Maxine.</i>

<i>There's this dog park on her street
where she just plays with her for hours.</i>

What about this one?

<i>That one was the stud on a kennel
that got closed down last month.</i>

The poor little guy
must be lonely, huh?

Your name is Max.
Got it? Max.

Hold on.

Uh! Geez.

<i>You alright?</i>

I- I'm trying to teach my dog
how to lie down.

<i>See?
Like this.</i>

Is that a smile?

This means I'm half way
to being your good friend.

I do not like men
who follow me.

Follow you?
I just moved here.

I was showing Max
his new hangout.

My dog's name is Max.
Uh, Maxine.

Where is your Max?

He's over there.

He's studying to be
a proctologist.

Now I'm more
than halfway.

This means you have to let me
take you out to dinner. I'm Lance.

I'm new in town, and, right
now, you're my only friend.

Do not worry. Because if
you're anything like your dog,

you'll make friends quick.

Help.
Help!

<i>She loves boarding down to the
promenade to see the street performers.</i>

<i>The wackier,
the better.</i>

<i>For my finale
I will use this wood.</i>

It is no ordinary wood.

It is sacred wood.

Ooh!

<i>Now that we have
honored the wood,</i>

it is okay to destroy the wood.

<i>Thank you.</i>

Please, give your donations for
my show to the human bowling ball.

How about breaking this?

No.

This is a nice board.

I'm getting a new one.

<i>Yeah, come on!</i>

Yeah, come on!
Do it!

You can do it.

Break it.

<i>Ooh!</i>

<i>You're not making
the Porsche?</i>

So why don't you just quit
when the job gets this tough?

Please, don't yell.

Sorry.

<i>It pays double.
If they reconcile,</i>

I'll be able to get
another shot at the race.

I thought
that bird died.

<i>He was staying in my
room, but my new dog, Max,</i>

he likes sleeping in there.
But this bird, he gets restless,

<i>starts yelling,
and he won't shut up.</i>

<i>Use two hands, honey.
It won't bite.</i>

You're keeping it
in the bedroom, huh?

<i>That's why
you're still single</i>

<i>because those are
the type of girls you date.</i>

<i>That's it, baby.
Spank it like you mean it.</i>

<i>Even if I was capable of-</i>

Where would I find a girl who
wasn't a bit afraid of racing cars?

<i>Or someone who would do something insane
to see if she had the guts to do it?</i>

Or someone who could dance the mambo with
me so well that we could do it blindfolded?

<i>Cucumbers are
in the refrigerator.</i>

That's kinky.

Lance.

Kenneth.

<i>I thought I told you to keep
your ass off this track.</i>

What are you doing here?
Isn't it past your bedtime?

<i>Racers, please
prepare to race.</i>

<i>The winner,
receive your winning tickets.</i>

<i>And here we go.</i>

Three.

<i>Two.</i>

<i>One.</i>

Compliments from my dog.

That bit.

That's just disrespectful.

You can't break the rules.

You should be removed
from the track.

Good driving.
You've got a gift.

Do you give lessons?

Thanks, boys.
That was fun.

Turn off your engines, boys.
This is a man's job.

<i>Yeah, but she doesn't
like feminine things.</i>

<i>I'm smoother than you,
and I want the best.</i>

<i>Don't forget to tell her
about the chlamydia.</i>

You know, some
might just call this fate.

I call it bad timing.

<i>How is your head?</i>

Better than my heart.
You're a tough girl.

<i>I just got out
of a relationship,</i>

and I'm not looking
for another.

I do not enjoy
conversation,

specially with men
I do not know.

And I am moving back
to Italy in a month

because I hate
American men.

Do you still
want a date?

It's not my fault you cannot
handle a big set of melons.

I need to get her
fixed up for street.

We don't work
on junk yard cars here.

I thought Wally could make
every car be a star!

Wally could,
but Wally's gone.

His kids forced him
into retirement.

<i>Said he was
getting useless.</i>

He's was put out to pasture. Much
like you should do with this car.

<i>If you got your heart
bent on it,</i>

<i>leave it here and I'll take it
back to the junk yard myself.</i>

Where's Wally now?

Beautiful, isn't she?

Beautiful isn't the word.

Solid frame.

Nice, nice!

Yeah.

She needs a new
front end at least.

She looks good
to me.

Front and rear
is smoking!

Ooh, I wanna get under her
and see what she's packing.

If this left hand could still
stretch for the ninth cord,

those O'Maley widows
would be ours!

Dom-di-dom-dom.

We gotta get her
fixed up for street.

I'm sure if you guys
can help,

I'm willing to take
a leap of faith.

It takes more than a
slick car and a fast dream

and a leap of faith
to win the big race.

It's big shoulders
and wide eyes.

And steel balls.

You crashed last year because
your reflexes were too slow.

Have they gotten
any quicker this year?

<i>She'll need an engine overhaul.
All the rockers, timing change.</i>

Labor's free. You pay for the
parts we get at Mean Mike's.

That's due on the day
of the race.

<i>This way you'll have the
same chance as anybody else.</i>

<i>Assuming that your reflexes
are as fast on the track</i>

as they were
on the garage today.

There's the loaner.

<i>She loves Carlini's.</i>

<i>Specially the mussels and clams appetizer
with the eggplant Parmesan entree.</i>

<i>Although she's not too crazy
about all the cheese.</i>

<i>We'll start with
the mussels and the clams.</i>

<i>For the entree, two eggplant
Parmesans, please.</i>

Go easy
on the mozzarella.

You got this so perfect.

Sometimes you have
to take chances.

To taking chances?

I was taking a chance
the night you met me.

Dancing?

Sometimes I like to do crazy things
just to see if I will actually do them.

Me, too.

That's why I was Samurai Sal. I
was doing fine until you came along.

I wanted to give
those kids a treat.

I love kids.

They can just always
be themselves.

I hate people who have
to put on an act.

Me, too.

That's why I'm moving back
to Italy in a month.

<i>I don't have
many friends here.</i>

I haven't had
a close friend in years.

Unless you include Max.

I love my Max.
I love all animals, actually.

Except for birds.

Like rats with wings.

To our Maxes.

You said you just
got out of a relationship.

What happened
to that friend?

He was not
the best looking man.

But, uh, he was sweet
and loyal.

It's a hard combination
to find in a man.

<i>He started to do something
that I cannot stand for.</i>

What's that?

He started to do-

He started to, uh-

Started to-

How do you say?

He started to-

Hello?

Now?
Uh, yeah, no.

I must go.

Do you want me-

No.
Sit, enjoy your food

and, um, I will make
this up to you.

He started to lie
about who he was

and not being himself.

Do you understand?

Kind of.

<i>You lied.</i>

I told her
I was a Navy Seal.

What else?

That I was a master chef.

I can't even toast
a Pop Tart.

Okay, just calm down.

Calm down.

I have already devised
a plan for reconciliation.

Every girl
has got the perfect man

that she dreams about spending
the rest of her life with.

<i>Not so much as looks, you
know, but his personality.</i>

His dreams.
His desires.

<i>I'm gonna find out what that
perfect man is and become him.</i>

She'll fall for me.
Actually, Mr. Fix It.

So much that she'll cancel
her move back to Italy.

She's moving back
to Italy?

When she cancels her move,
she's fallen for Mr. Fix It.

Then,

I'll reveal that all the
reasons she fell for me are lies.

Lies told on an effort to become
her good friend for those two weeks.

<i>But now that she's cancelled the
move, she's gotta know the truth</i>

because I don't want a relationship
and I don't want to fall in love.

It'll make your lies
look like childhood fibs.

She'll be in such a tale spin, she's
gonna need someone to hold on to.

That's where you come in.

Will it work?

Take a leap of faith!

Now, do you have anything
that'll remind her of you?

I have this candelabra on my
coffee table. She loves it.

Great.
Send it to this address.

Oh, and, uh-

learn some of this, uh?

She likes it
when you speak Italian.

<i>Hello, babe,
what's going on?</i>

<i>Don't forget tonight until
10:30 all drinks 50% off.</i>

Hope you left
your cellphone at home

'cause I'm not letting you
get off so easy.

I never get off easy.

Two Jack and Cokes.
Easy on the Coke.

Gutsy.

I like a man
who takes control.

I saw you.
You like when people watch.

There's a better view
from upstairs.

This place lets people
forget their troubles.

They're much more free.

I like a girl
who can drink.

Come on.

I told you it's a
better view from up here.

Look at them.

Do you want
to be free, Lance?

Dance with me.

Dance with me.

It's been a long time since-

You bitch.

Sorry?

You gotta be kidding me.

You know this guy?

No.

Okay, pal. Why don't you
go home and sleep it off?

All I wanna know
is why you did it.

I'm gonna put this
as nicely as possible.

<i>Ugh!
Oh!</i>

I'm gonna break
your face!

<i>It's getting stuffed in here.
Let's get some air.</i>

I want to dance.

What are they doing?

I want to dance.

Let's dance.

Whoa!

Come, come.

Ta-ra.

I rescue this damsel
in distress

and all she has for me
is her laugh.

And a kiss.

Ugh!
But you are still a frog.

<i>I like a man who can dance.</i>

You like a man who can dance
and who takes control.

So far, you know,
I'm two for two.

What else do you like?
What is your perfect man?

I like a man
who is spontaneous.

Let's fly to Paris
right now.

I like a man
who is romantic.

Shall I compare thee
to summer's day?

Thou art more lovely.

I like a man
who is cocky.

Falling in love with me,
aren't you?

I like a man
who is funny.

What do you get when you cross
an elephant with a rhinoceros?

Elephino.

I like a man who sacrifices making
a lot of money to pursue a dream.

A dream which he can reach and one
which he cannot wait to share with me.

And I like a man who is in touch
with the child that lives inside,

and he likes to play
childish games,

and he's not embarrassed
to play them with me.

And I like a man who is willing
to take a leap of faith.

And I can see his faith in us
every time he looks at me,

and I can feel it in his touch
every time he caresses me.

But most of all,

I like a man who knows how
to quit when he's ahead.

<i>Every year this town holds
a Citrus Beach street car race</i>

for anyone who qualifies.
It's quite the event.

People come
from miles away to watch.

If you win, you get to race
in the Clearway 200.

Professional drivers,
professional track.

If you win in street, it's the
best chance to get on the circuit.

Is that your dream?

That's why I'm in this town.
This year's gonna be my year.

Where is
your dream machine?

It is beautiful.

I want to be the first
to give you a victory kiss.

You're not afraid
of racing cars?

Takes a lot more than that
to scare me.

Me, too.

Hi, Max.
Hello.

Hello.
Hello!

My ex has a candelabra
just like these.

He did have god taste.

Do you miss him?

<i>I don't miss the lying.</i>

And I certainly don't miss how
he always wanted to have sex

in the middle
of a touching moment.

Who is this?

<i>That's my dad.
He's a good driver.</i>

Came here to race
when I was a kid.

Did he race a lot?

He was always taking me
to see the cars.

I loved the cars. He truly
felt I could do anything

as long as I believed
that dreams come true.

He always said that.

Do you see him often?

He died
when I was 18.

He had a great smile.

When I close my eyes
and see him,

he's always smiling.

You have his smile.

Can I rip off your panties
and make love to you right now?

No!

I'm not wearing
any panties.

We shouldn't do this.

No.

Phone, phone.

Hello?

<i>Tonight?</i>

Uh, um, I'll-

<i>I'll pack some
up on the way.</i>

Okay. Okay.

<i>I must go.</i>

Good bye my... good friend.

<i>Seems like everybody's
got a girlfriend.</i>

Even I got a girlfriend.
I hate to tell you this, Lance,

but it looks like
you're the last man standing.

Sure I am.

What's the big deal
about love, anyway?

These people
seem to need it.

Do you think these people
really feel true love?

Or is it just companionship?

Excuse me, sir.

<i>Immediately after you finish
making love,</i>

do you think about how fortunate it is
to share such unconditional intimacy,

or do you just fall asleep?

What do you think?

But I don't snore,
do I, honey?

Hey, you. When you
set the alarm at night,

do you give yourself and extra
half hour just so you can hold her?

<i>Ouch!</i>

<i>When you're together
and there's silence,</i>

do you think about
what the other's thinking?

I think about the dog
I wanna get.

You don't think about me?

This place makes me sick.

Wait! This Italian
girl does crazy things

just to see
if she can do them.

Can dance the mambo
blindfolded.

Isn't afraid of racing cars
and you feel nothing.

She's a job. A job that's
about to kick in overdrive.

Oh, no.

The pretty and pig stage.

That's right.

Time to make her love me like
a montage in a bad '80s movie.

What are you thinking?

The ocean.

It's loud.

There's really nothing
to look at except water.

And it smells
like fish.

Yet, it is so soothing.

My grandma, she lives
on the beach in Italy.

And all she does is sit on her
deck and stare at the waves.

As if each one
is a different memory.

Couple more days
and you'll be seeing her.

My ex-boyfriend is here.

<i>Go say hello.</i>

<i>Grazie.</i>

<i>Just like I said.</i>

Say hi.

<i>Better keep you
in her mind.</i>

He's a sweet man.

A liar but sweet.

He actually said
that I was his true love.

It's funny.

<i>Why?</i>

Don't you believe
true love exists?

Don't ask me.

You should ask someone
who has lived.

<i>Wanna know if
we believe in what?</i>

True love.

Sure. The kind of love that grows
deeper as the years progress.

Exactly.

See if that fixed it.

Hold it, hold it.

So, what you wanna know
is if we believe in true love.

Yeah. We've all been lucky enough
to find it at least once in our life.

Don't you believe
that it exists?

I think I'm incapable of it.

<i>Incapable?</i>

You're afraid.

Look at you.
Young and vibrant.

<i>You have the whole
world in your grasp.</i>

Maybe that's why you don't
have love in your life.

You're afraid
if you fall in love,

maybe you'll lose
all of that.

And you'll end up like we did. Like, uh, they say
What do they say we were?

Useless.

Yeah.

Useless.

<i>Ah. Ah!</i>

Bingo.

You fixed it?

No. We have to go
to Bingo.

<i>If we don't leave now,</i>

we're not gonna be able to sit
across from the O'Maley widows.

Don't worry about it, kid.
You'll figure it out.

Wally and the boys
say good luck.

It looks great, Lance.
You're up.

That is for luck.

There's lot
of good racers here.

You know, I think
I need more luck.

The thin track, luck, and
sometimes play rolling-

Sun can sometimes-

<i>Lance Valenteen,
please sign in.</i>

Coming, coming!

<i>What do you think, Lance?</i>

<i>It's like
a dream come true.</i>

Spread the word, Lance.

<i>Yeah. That us old folks
ain't got useless after all.</i>

Spread the word.

How is he doing?

Not bad.

<i>You're in, Lance. Best
time, yet. See you Sunday.</i>

Too bad you're not gonna
be around to see me race.

I'm not going anywhere.

Bu- but Italy-

I cancelled my move, Lance. There
is no way I'm going to miss this.

<i>You'll have the money
for the parts, right?</i>

I sure will.

That's all
we gotta say?

And you'll give us
all those tickets?

Yeah.

You want me to pull away
after she sees me and the dog.

You got an extra
set of keys, right?

We'll just park it
round the corner.

Lance-a-rooney!

Hi, Pops. How about
dinner tomorrow night?

Sure.

I know this is gonna
sound strange.

But, uh, I was wondering
if you could wait-

<i>Tomorrow is D-day.</i>

This is how
is gonna work.

Sophia loves dogs.

She loves my dog Max.

<i>At 6:30 she's gonna
arrive at my house</i>

<i>for an evening
of dinner and dance.</i>

<i>As she walks up,</i>

<i>she'll see the local dog
catcher parked outside my house.</i>

<i>Caged in the back
will be Max,</i>

<i>being driven away
to a seemingly helpless fate.</i>

<i>Then at 6:32,</i>

what happened to the inner child
that she treasures in a man?

<i>A group of kids who
know Sophia from Go Karts</i>

<i>will tell her
they've seen her with me.</i>

<i>They'll beg her to talk
some sense into me.</i>

<i>I threatened to beat them up when
they played their loud stupid games</i>

<i>outside my house.</i>

<i>I broke a bike one time
I got so mad.</i>

<i>I love car racing.</i>

<i>My dream is to win street.</i>

Following your dream
is very important to her.

<i>More important than money.</i>

<i>At 6:40 she'll think that fixing up
my Camaro was not to pursue my dream</i>

<i>but to make a quick buck.</i>

<i>There will be two guys high-fiving
each other excited to race street.</i>

<i>Excited because
they just bought a rare.</i>

<i>Then, at 6:44
she enters my house.</i>

<i>My recently acquired house, since
she thinks I just moved to town.</i>

<i>She'll start asking
all these questions.</i>

<i>The car,
the kids, the dog.</i>

<i>Then she'll see my bird
and be like,</i>

<i>"You have a bird?
You hate birds. "</i>

<i>In an effort to calm her down,
I'll ask her to sit by me.</i>

<i>When she does,</i>

<i>I'll show her my Citrus
Beach High School yearbook.</i>

<i>She'll realize
I didn't just move to town.</i>

<i>I've lived here all my life.</i>

That's when I tell her
that everything

has been a lie.

I'm not who you think I am.

<i>I'll tell her.</i>

I'm actually... a liar.

Max was my dog,
I hate birds,

I love to do childish things. I'm new
in this town. My dream is to race cars.

They were all lies. Lies told on
an effort to become your good friend

<i>until you left for Italy. But
now that you're not leaving,</i>

I can't continue the lying, and I
certainly can't continue to see you.

<i>At that point
she'll probably stand up,</i>

<i>throw something at me,
and leave.</i>

<i>To top it off,
as she's leaving</i>

<i>she'll see my father
on the other side of the door.</i>

<i>Alive and well.</i>

<i>At 7:45 you surprise her with a dozen
roses and a sympathetic shoulder.</i>

<i>Right now, your lies are the
farthest thing from her mind.</i>

My life will be complete
if this works.

So will mine.

<i>It has to work, 'cause
she's the only one for me</i>

and I don't wanna
grow old alone.

That would suck.

Hurry up. You're the one
who wanted to do this.

I feel like
I'm 20 years old.

Alright, maybe 40.

Lad, a little help.

Oh!

<i>I can't remember
the last time I ran so fast.</i>

I don't feel
so useless now.

Did you see that,
Lance?

I'm not sure
what I'm seeing.

Surprise!

Sophia,
you didn't need to-

What I need and what I
want is seldom different.

Yes.

I'm on my way.

I have to run, but, um,
I will come back later.

We go dancing, yes?

Why do you always
get called away?

You want to see my dream?

<i>This country
is the only country</i>

<i>that does not cherish
its elders.</i>

<i>It thinks they're, um,
how do you say?</i>

Useless?

My dream is to change
all that

by showing how much
older people can still give.

Who knows?

It might even reveal
the secret to life.

She's ready for you now.

<i>I apologize, but you just never
know when they're ready to open up.</i>

<i>Grazie.</i>

<i>She was beautiful.</i>

Come.

<i>Thank you so much.</i>

I brought a friend today,
Ms. Cliverhorn.

Okay. Whenever
you're ready.

I thought about your question

and it kept me up several
nights as it did others.

I thought it was
a difficult question,

but actually
it's quite simple.

<i>When I was young,
about your age,</i>

I was fascinated
with old people.

I watched them as if they
were warning signs of life.

"Be careful or some day
you'll be old. "

It made me believe that the
secret of life was staying young.

<i>No responsibilities,
no worries, no problems.</i>

As long as I remained
spontaneous, playful, and carefree,

I would never become old.

<i>Unfortunately, possessing those
qualities had a bitter side effect.</i>

Loneliness.

When I was young I didn't notice
the loneliness, but as I got older

staying young became
more and more difficult.

<i>Loneliness, I realized,
was starting to make me old.</i>

But instead of finding somebody to be
spontaneous, playful, and carefree with me,

I continued lying to myself.

As so many do.

Until now.

The secret of life
isn't staying young.

The secret of life is finding a love
that grows fonder as you grow older.

It's what many call true love.

Because when you have true love you
feel young, no matter what age you are.

True love
makes you young.

Do you understand?

Bill. Bill!

What the hell
are you doing?

Oh, hey, Lance. What's up?
I'll be right back, okay?

How're you doing?

Who's that?

Uh, Carol.

Great kisser but not the
brightest ball in the house.

Which is good, 'cause it'll make it easier
to cheat on Sophia when I get her back.

But you were
so distraught.

I'm paying you
to do a job.

If you'll excuse me,
I need to get her home

so I can prepare
for my big night.

'Cause I hate for you to have to
give me that car and miss the race

since it seems you already used
my refund money to fix it up.

Right?

You're dating that guy
who races go karts, right?

You seem like a nice lady
but... that guy is crazy.

Look what he did
to my bicycle.

<i>You are sure
this is Lance?</i>

Lives in there?
It's him.

Sorry to tell you
all this, lady.

But he's making our lives
living hell.

He doesn't even
take showers.

I'll talk to him.

Thanks, lady.

<i>We got us
a new ride, baby.</i>

This baby's taking me
to the promised land.

Yeah!

I just saw Max
an- and these boys.

They said you've been hurting
them. You car, did you sell it?

<i>Where is Max going?
And-</i>

A bird?

I thought you hated birds.

Calm down.
Just... sit here.

I don't understand.

It's 1995.

You said you just moved here.

I needed you to see
all this because...

I'm not who you think I am.

I'm actually-

You are actually what?

I'm actually...

Mr. Fix It.

I was hired by
your ex-boyfriend Bill

to make you
get back with him.

You broke up with him
because of his lying.

I was supposed
to get you to fall for me

and then tell you
everything was lies.

His lies wouldn't look
that bad. I can't do it

because
I've fallen for you.

So thi- this is all
been a job.

Yes!

No!

I haven't been Mr. Fix It. I've
been who I've never been able to be.

Myself.

Well, I never
want to see you again.

<i>Listen to me, okay?</i>

Look, I'm in love with you.

Love?

What do you know
about love?

I can't think of tomorrow
without thinking of you.

And that makes me,
for the first time ever,

look forward
to the rest of my life.

Please!

Don't open that door.

I am actually

Karen Shawnassy.

Also known as Ms. Fix It.

My employees.

<i>Bill Smith.
Maggy Cliverhorn.</i>

Also of course your friends

<i>who hired me to prove to you that you
really are capable of love after all.</i>

I hope you realize
what a special gift it is.

Because to go through life without
love, is to never live at all.

I believe you owe us
a refund.

No exceptions whatsoever.

It's around the corner.

If it's any consolation,

<i>I was really starting-</i>

Hey, Lance.

The guys have known about
Mr. Fix It for a long time.

I'm sorry.

We just... wanted to show you
how important love is.

Well... congratulations.
You succeeded.

Come on.
I've got a surprise for you.

I've had enough surprises.

Yeah, I know, but, uh,
this one's really fast.

Hey, Lance.

It's all yours.

It's ready for action.

Listen to me.

Stay alert. Watch the
sides. Keep it even.

And do not be afraid
to make a mistake.

Even a great car
can make a mistake.

No matter how good she feels
or how good she looks.

And that's when the driver
has to be forgiving.

Because that's the only way you're
gonna get to the finish line.

I questioned early on
whether or not

you were gonna be
my last case.

You see, things started to
feel just different with you.

And the more time
we spent together,

the more caring
started to come out.

Hey.

Hey.
How's it going?

I actually think
he's really cute.

Oh-oh.

Do you think
these socks are too much?

<i>And I questioned
for the first time</i>

<i>if I was capable
of such deception.</i>

<i>And I realized
in the end that-</i>

<i>I wasn't.</i>

See, you have allowed me
to just be me as well.

I'm Karen Shawnassy.

And as of today
I've started a new career.

Race car ownership.

And, uh, I'd like you
to me my driver.

<i>Grazie.</i>

<i>Let's go win a race.</i>

Wow. Really looks good,
don't you think, ladies?

Oh, nice and firm.

It's got some miles but that
makes for a smoother ride.

<i>And I can't wait
to check that dipstick.</i>

Let's go!
