[gentle music]

[birds chirping]

Oh...

[gentle music]

Ah.


[mimicking trumpets]

[clears throat]

[mimicking trumpet]

Why aren't you ready for track?

I'm not going to tack, it's too hot.

Oh, you're going.

[grunts]
Oh, come on.

Let's go, buddy. Come on.

I got breakfast on the table. Let's go.

[gentle, upbeat music]

Oh, I really wish I didn't
have to go to work today.

Please just stay home
today. It's Saturday.

Why do you have to go to work?

Last minute client.
Needs to be done today.

I hate getting up early for dance.

What are you drawing there?
It's for Payton.

Why are your candles so crooked?

Because I don't like straight lines.

Okay.

That's a good answer.

Okay. What you drawin' over there?

It's for Payton's birthday party.

Oh, it's so cute.

But where is daddy?

Can we make pancakes?

No, baby, we don't have time.

You got to go to dance.

Good morning.

You look great.

Dad.
Hm?

I think it's time for you to upgrade

from the Tyrannosaurus text.

Tyrannosaurus text?

Cute. No, I love my phone.

I have no time or
interest in those gadgets

you kids play with.

I see how you guys are on your telephones,

walking into parked
cars, playing Pokie-man.

Pokie-man? That's cute.

You can't play Pokie-man on a pager.

This is a telephone and
I only have to charge

this telephone every few days.

You guys are constantly plugged in.

So why don't you go read
a book or somethin'?

All right, well, what
if you want to know

where every restaurant
in Manhattan is, hm?

What if I want to know where
you are all day, every day?

Uh...
Anyway...

Can you make pancakes?

Pancakes. Coming right up.

Ah!
Turkey pancakes.

All right, who's gonna eat this thing.

I will!

I love pancake lunches.

Dad, um, you'll be home by three, right?

Please, daddy.
Okay, I'll be home by three.

Now get outta here.
Promise?

Yes, I promise.
Come on girls.

go, let's gi, let's go.

Let's go. Hut, hut, hut, hut.


[upbeat music]

[phone beeping]

Michael!

Yeah?
Let's go!

[soft, upbeat music]

Would you pick up Payton's
birthday cake after track?

I'd appreciate it.

The bakery's just way out of my way.

Well, I can't today.

After track, I have a math tutor.

Math tutor?

Why? You're not doing well in math?

Yeah. Told you that like a month ago.

Remember, you took my phone away?

Yeah.

Said being good at math is in our genes?

Oh, I remember that now.

I remember that now,

Why didn't he ask me for help?

'Cause you're always on that damn phone.

Well, I figured that
because you're my father,

maybe would have just helped me

because I'm trying my best and it's-

I will help you next time, I promise.

I'll ask your mom if she
has time to get the cake.

So anyway...

How's track going?

It's fine.
Yeah?

I'm fast, but this one kid's got me beat

and I'm pretty sure it's just because

of his expensive running shoes.

Really?

Expensive running shoes?

You know what I think?
What?

I think success is
earned, it's never given-

Okay.
And I would bet money

that kid's on track more than you are.

[Michael sighs]

I'm not mad, you're just wrong, okay?

He's never even been at practice.

So you think if I buy you those shoes

that you'll be able to beat him?

Oh, 100%.

I'll tell you what, you score
100 on your next math quiz,

I will buy those shoes and I'll
be at your next competition

where you're wearing those shoes.

I mean my next exam is Monday.

Better get started, pal.

Are you serious? Don't
play with me, okay?

I'm gonna need your help.
I'm serious.

Go to track.


I'll see you when you get home.

â™ª Onward and forward â™ª

â™ª They say life aint

â™ª Searching for my home â™ª

â™ª And I go alone â™ª

â™ª I waited and stood 'till dusk â™ª

â™ª Its whispers and the melodies â™ª

[Roman sighs]

[soft acoustic music]

Good morning.

Good morning.

You're new, huh?

I am new. I'm James.

How you doing, James?

There you go, buddy.

Hey, what's this?
That's my kid's lunch.

He left it, you can have it.

Are you sure?
Positive.

I didn't grab breakfast
this morning. Thank you.

Good for me.

I'll be back at 1:30 for the car.

You got it.
Thanks, buddy.

Thanks again.

[gentle music]

Hey, good morning.

Good morning, Yarge.

What are you doing here on Saturday?

Work, work, work. Got to do it.

If you need anything, let me know.

Just give me a call on the cell phone.

Thanks, buddy.

[elevator pings]

Hm.

Good morning, Susan.
Morning, Roman.

Have you written up that agreement

for the Brooklyn ad campaign?

Not just yet.

I have a feeling they're going
to give this to someone else.

Oh how funny.

Look, you get 'em on the phone,

tell 'em you need to right away,

whether they like it or not.

I've been working on it
all night, barely slept.

And we came in on a Saturday
so they could have it tomorrow.

Get them on the phone.

[soft, upbeat music]

[phone ringing]

They're signing it.

How do you do that?

Sound reason and threats.

This is what I live for.

My specialty is to convince.

I just can't convince my family

how important this work
is, especially Mike.

Thank you, dear.

That's how it is in everyone's life.

I really don't have time to
do all this paperwork today,

not to mention, I don't want to get upset.

It's Payton's birthday.

I'm supposed to go get
the cake and the pizza

and I have to get there
early to take her her gift.

What are you guys doing?

Having a party at the house.

Her friends from school and dance class.

A little tutu brigade all day.

She was so excited this morning.

We're going to have a bunch of kids

run in the house all day.

Oh, good.

I'll be at my desk if you need anything.

Thank you, doll.

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

â™ª To you â™ª

â™ª To you â™ª

â™ª To you â™ª

[Nicole laughing]

Lily?


That was a really beautiful painting

that you did this morning.

But where was daddy?

Because daddy's always working.

Well, daddy's working
so we can have this house

and birthday parties and presents.

Yeah, but daddy doesn't
even know my favorite color.

Every time I draw him a picture,
he doesn't even look at it.

Honey, he loves your pictures.

He has them hanging in his office.

I don't think so.

Does daddy know your
favorite color, mommy?

Yeah, of course he does.

I think so.

It's teal blue.

That's a pretty color.

It is, yeah.

I like this color, or this color.

You know what I think?

I think we should all have
some more bonding time.

You know, mommy used to be an artist.

Like me?

Like you, honey.

Where should we hang this?

Up there.

Okay.

Go grab tape.
Okay.

[gentle music]

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª


You're so funny.
I know.

It's so pretty. Look what we did.

I know.

One second.

But you think it needs
a little glitter, mommy?

It does.

Let's go to your room
and add some glitter.


So what's with these
smartphones, anyway?

What's with them?

Yeah, my kids were giving me a bad time

this morning for having a flip phone.

Well, flip phones
are just about extinct.

Thank you very much.

And a smartphone has pretty much

everything you need to sustain life.

To sustain life?

So it grows food?

No, but you can order food on it.

Yeah?

Okay, what's this video call?

How does that work?

You just call a number
and you can see the person.

Yeah?

Let's call Mike.

I think Mike's smart
enough not to pick up.

Oh, come on. Let's try it.

Okay.
Cool.

Except I can't get it on the phone now.

[phone ringing]
There we go.


Hello?

Hello?

Mike.

It's me.

Dad?

Where are you?

I'm outside running laps. What's up?

Oh, I can see. Cool.

Just text me.

Wait, wait, wait.

I just want-
Just text.

I got to go. Text me.

See? He doesn't trust you.

He's very distant. You can tell.

I guess that's where
my father was with me.

Never affection, always giving orders.

You're going to have a real hard time

when that boy grows up.

He's a really good kid.

He really is.
Do you ever tell him that?

He knows it.

Okay, that's my cue. I'm going to go.

Do you need anything else?

No, I'm good.

Okay, the super's leaving
the building at one.

You'll be the only one in the building.

Okay.

The only one in the building.

[soft music]



let's go get the cake!
I know.

We're late already.

One second.


Buckle up.
Okay!

â™ª I'm a birthday cake â™ª

â™ª I'm havin' fun â™ª

â™ª I'm a birthday cake, it's true â™ª

â™ª I love you â™ª

â™ª I love you â™ª

â™ª I'm a birthday cake â™ª

â™ª I'm havin' fun â™ª

â™ª I'm a birthday cake â™ª




[Lily gasps]

I just cleaned that display case.

Okay, relax, she's just a kid.

Yeah. I'm just a kid.

What's the order under?

It's Roman.

It says Happy Birthday Payton.

You don't have a ticket number?

My husband had it.

It should be under the
name Nicole or Roman.

Okay, I can call my husband
for the ticket number.

I'll try. Just give me a minute.

[phone line trilling]

I don't have a birthday cake for Payton,

but I have one for Lily.

[Lily gasps]

For me?

You know, my husband
must have made a mistake.

It's supposed to say Payton.

Any chance you can change the name?


It's spelled P-A-Y-T-O-N.

Thank you.

Can she have one?

Do you want a cupcake?

Yes, please.

Which one would you like?

That one, with the unicorn

and don't look a mistake.
[Nicole laughs]

[mid-tempo music]

[keys clacking]

[mid-tempo upbeat music]


Let me out.

One second.

Come on, Missy.

Look at your face. Who painted this?

I didn't paint it, it's my cupcake.

Let's go.

We have to hurry, it's her birthday.

[Lily grunts]

One second. Let me open the car.


Here, do you need help?

I can help you.
Yes, please.

Better hurry.

Okay.

Buckle up.


Did you eat cake already?

I just had a cupcake.

Oh.

Well, how was it, kid?

It was good. We had chips and cookies.

Did you learn anything new?

[sighs]
Not really.

Okay, once we get home, you
really need to change this.

I'm ready.

You know, I mean, you're
not going to wear this.

Why don't you put the dress?

I don't want to wear
that raggedy old dress.

It doesn't even look nice on me.

Dad promised me he'd take
me to get a new dress.

Well, we all knew it
was not going to happen,

so I guess we're just going to make do.

[car starts up]

[gentle music]

[girls chattering]


Mommy, let me out.
One second.

Mommy.
I'm coming, I'm coming.


Let me out!
Come on.

Liliana stop.
Sugarface.


You quit whining.


Lily, you shouldn't be whining.

I'm not whining, you're whining.

Let's go.
[Payton sighs]

Okay.

So excited to eat cake.
You already had a cupcake.


[upbeat music]

Whoa, mom.

You did such an awesome
job, this is so cool.

You like it?
I love it.

Thanks, mom.
Aww.

You're welcome.

I helped.
Thanks, Lily.

Can I help with anything?

No, just go get dressed, honey.

Okay, mom.

Your dress is on the bed.

I know how much you love it.

I'm calling dad.

He promised me a new one.

[tense music]

[line trilling]

Yes, I know.

Of course I did.

Hold on a second. It's my kid.

Yeah.

Payton, what's up?

Dad, you promised me you'd
take me to get a new dress.

Payton, Payton, Payton, calm down.

I got a surprise for you when I get home.

You always have to go.

Yes I do. [laughs]

Dad?
[line beeps]

[Payton sighs]

[melancholy music]

[tires skid]

[phone thuds]


[tense music]

[lights flickering]


Not today.

[dramatic music]

[birds chirping]

Where is he?

He should be here soon, Pay.

Don't count on it.

Don't worry, hun.

He said it's not going
to be like last year.

[melancholy music]

[birds chirping]

[melancholy music]

All right, bro.

[melancholy music]

Later, man.

What's up, Pay?

Payton.

Pay, what's wrong?

You okay?

Okay...

[birds chirping]

What's her problem?

[Nicole sighs]

She doesn't think your
dad's going to make it.

Come on, he'll be here.

I know he will.

Go tell her that. She
really needs to get ready.

Her friends will be here soon.

All right.

I'll go talk to her.


[somber music]

[Michael growls]

Stop it!

Leave me alone, Mike.

Come on. You gotta get
ready for your party.

I am ready.

You're going to wear
this to your own party?

What's wrong with it?

I just, I don't know. I
thought you could do better.

I'm not wearing that ugly dress.

I told mom five times.

Okay, what do you want to wear?

This doofus. Why can't I wear this?

I mean you can, but, you
kind of look like a foot.

Ugh. I'm going inside.

Yeah, while you're at it,

why don't you go brush your teeth

with some poppy seeds and broccoli, huh?

You stink.

What do you think you're doing?

Going to go get ready.

Do you need help?

No.

Lily, where are you?


Oh, Mike's going to come and find you.

Hello?

Is anyone there?

Oh, man, this is not cool.

[tense music]

[sirens blaring]
[tense music]

[tense music]


Hey.

So I talked to dad earlier

and he said that if he wasn't back in time

for you to go ahead and
give Payton her gift.

What is it, mommy?

I don't really know
what he's talking about.

He said it's in the closet.

[soft, upbeat music]

Not there!

What am I even looking for?

I can ask him.

Check my closet.

[soft, upbeat music]

Hm.

[Payton gasps]

[soft, upbeat music]

[Payton screams]

What is it?


What's wrong?

What is it?

[Michael laughs]

I can't believe it.

Wow.

That's really nice.

Did he pick that out by himself?

Actually, no.

We went to Manhattan a few months ago.

I remember I saw this dress in the window.

I stopped to admire it

and my breath fogged up all the windows.

I remember telling him
how pretty it looked.

That's so nice of him.

You like it, Mike?

I love it.

And now you won't smell like a foot.


Good one.

Oh.

Well, I should call him to say sorry.

For what?

I said some pretty mean
things to him earlier.

Oh.

Go get dressed.

Go put it on.

Okay.

Come on. [chuckles]

[somber music]

Man...

She is never going to understand this.

Oh, I'm going to be in the doghouse

so much with my little baby.

Oh, come on, man. Don't do that.

No, no, no, no, no.

Don't roam on me.

Roaming, roaming.

Roaming.

[doorbell chimes]

Pay, come get the door.

Your friends are here.




Hi guys.

Son of a...

Hello!


[doorbell chimes]
[children chattering]

Hey guys, come on in.

Come, this way.


You're it.
Thank you guys.

See you later.

I can take it.

Thank you.

Okay.

Lesson in cool. Gotta be cool.

Gotta be really cool.


When you were a little boy,

all the lights went out in
New York, remember? [laughs]

All those people stuck in elevators.

That was such a mess.

Oh, man, I do not like this.


Oh man.

[upbeat music]
[children shouting]

Time out!
That's it, that's it.

[Roman sighs]

[children chattering]

[phone ringing]

Hello?

May I speak to Roman?

No, sorry. I left the office early.

Oh, um, good.

You know, it's Payton's birthday

and the kids are already here.

He was supposed to pick up pizza.

I would imagine he'd be
home any minute, though.

He was just finishing up the reports.

Okay.

Thank you.

[Nicole sighs]

Mike.

Come here for a second.

What's up?

I can't find your father.

What do you mean you can't find him?

I tried calling him. He's not answering.

Well that doesn't surprise me.

I talked to his secretary,
and I did the math.

He was supposed to be here hours ago.

Well did you check traffic?

No, you didn't.

[children shouting]

Traffic is backed up. See?

I don't know what to do.

Did you call his garage?

I don't know. I have no
idea where he parks his car.

You can Google it.

Okay. Mr. Tech.

I'll call 'em.

Thank you.
Mm-hm.

I'll watch the kids.

Kids, no climbing the tree.

Turn on the lights!

I'm stuck!

[children shouting]

No, it's my dad's car.

Uh, the license plate, um...

Do you know dad's license plate number?

Mm...

One second.

Okay. It is DMA...

1924.

Yeah, black, correct.

Oh.

He's checking.

[children shouting in the distance]

Yes.

Um...

Okay.

Thank you.

You, too.

It's not his.

Try another?

Yeah.

Please Mike.
We can keep tryin' 'em.

I'm going to go take care of the kids.

Okay.

[children shouting in the distance]

Hi. Yeah, um, I'm looking
for my dad's vehicle.

It is a black Discovery.

License plate number DMA1924.

[somber music]

[Roman mumbling]


[somber music]



Oh, man.

Oh man.

Oh no.

Oh no.




[papers rustling]


[mysterious music]

[phone ringing]

Hello, this is James.

Hi, yeah.

My name is Michael Juniper.

I'm looking for my father's vehicle.

I'm sorry. I can't give
out that information.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

My dad's missing, okay?

He was supposed to be home hours ago

for my sister's birthday and
he still hasn't showed up.

Okay. What's his plate number?

The plate number. It's um...

It's, I have it somewhere.

Hold on, hold on.

Hey, kid.

Did you eat lunch today?

What does that have to do with anything?

Some guy gave me a bag of lunch

and it had a birthday card in it.

Yes. That is his car.

I forgot my lunch in my
dad's car this morning.

That's this car, right?

I honestly can't give
you that information.

It's a black Discovery, okay?

Is it his car or not?

Yes, it's here.

Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

And...


Can you just tell him that his family

is worried about him if you see him?

I can do that. No problem.

[children shouting outside]

[somber music]

Excuse me, sir.

What happened over here?

We've got a single
car traffic collision.

Who was it? Anybody injured?

I can't tell you his name.

Do you know if it was Roman?

I can't tell you his name.

All right. Thank you.

It's gonna a long night.

But we gotta do what we gotta do

and it's bad enough that
we're here and that we s-

Excuse me, officers?

What's going on over here?

Texting and driving,
dude. We see it every day.

Was there anybody hurt?

We're not authorized to give
you that information, sir.

We can't help you with that, sir.

I need you to stay behind the line, okay?

Is it male or female?

We can't give you that information.

We're in no position to do that, sir.

It'd be best for you to
just move along, okay?

All right. Thanks.


[Roman grunts]



[tense music]

[Roman sobs]

This is such a messed up... [sniffles]

[Roman sobbing]
[paper bag rustling]

[Roman breathing heavily]
[somber music]

That does not work!

[Roman sobbing]

It doesn't.

[Roman sobbing]

[somber music]

We got to go, mom.

Go where?

To his office. He's gotta be there.

What are we going to
do with all the kids?

Fine, I'll just go.

No way, Mike. You just got your permit.

You can't drive without supervision.

Besides, it's going to take you two hours

to get to Manhattan at this point.

Okay? What do you want to do?

I don't know.

Fine.

I'll call the cops.
Wait.

Relax.

Let me call.

You're going to upset your sisters.

She's already upset.

[Nicole sighs]

Would you please just
go get some pizzas?

Get four pies.

Some pizzas?
Please.

[Nicole sighs]

Thank you.


[911 Operator] 911 operator.

Do you need police, fire or ambulance?

No, my husband is missing.

He was supposed to be home hours ago.

He's not answering his phone.

[911 Operator] Ma'am, this does not

seem like an emergency.

I'm sorry.

We called his parking garage
and his car is still there.

[911 Operator] Maybe he's working late?

I truly believe there's something wrong.

[911 Operator] What's the
physical address of this office?

It's 121 West 38th Street.

[911 Operator] Did you call his office?

I called the office and
everybody left for the day.

[911 Operator] Could he be running late-

No, ma'am he was supposed
to be here hours ago.

[911 Operator] Are you positive

he was coming straight home?

Yes, ma'am.

[911 Operator] It's a bit
early to file a police report,

but if you don't hear
from him by tomorrow,

you can call us back.
[Nicole sighs]

[somber music]

What'd they say?

They said it's too early
to report a missing person.

[sighs]
He's not missing.

What don't they get about that?

Mom, something is wrong.

He called me today and he never does that.

He called you?

Yeah.

I was at track practice
and I got a FaceTime

from a really strange number.

It was him just trying
to figure out the app,

but I had to go.

It doesn't feel right.

[somber music]

[Roman sighs]

Oh, man.

[Roman grunts]

Okay.

Oh, good, thank god.

Okay, let's text a little bit here buddy.

And...

[phone beeps]
Oh, come on man.

Don't do...

Return to sender? What?

Oh man.

Son of a gun.

[somber music]

Whew.



[somber music]

Oh, man.

[somber music]

[children shouting]

[doorbell chimes]

Guys, my dad's home with the pizza!

Hey.
What's up, man?

How much is it?
$60.

60?

All right, you just keep the change.

Thank you.

Enjoy.
Thanks, man.

Where is he?

He's gonna be home soon, Pay-

No!

Where is he?

Call him now.
I already called him.

What else do you want?
Mom!

Pay, I know. We tried to call him.

He didn't answer.

Why would he do this to me?

[melancholy music]

Kids, who wants pizza?


[melancholy music]

We tried to call him, Pay.

You've just got to realize dad's busy.

And his secretary left work early today

so he was even busier.

Hey, he's going to be here.

But for now you should
go and enjoy your party.

You only turn eight once.

I guess you're right.
Mm-hm.

Maybe we can have a family dinner

with him on another day.

See, that's a great idea.

I'll cook for everybody.

I just learned how to make
ramen in my cooking class.

Can I help?
Can you help?

Are you kidding me?

You make the best banana
pancakes I've ever had.

I need your skills.

Thanks Mike. I love you.

I love you too, kid.

Now go before your
friends eat all the pizza.

[children chattering]
[upbeat music]

[soft piano music]

[somber music]

There is never enough time in the day.

There's so much pressure on me.

So much pressure on me and every day.

So much pressure and every day I try

to make you guys proud.

Yep.

As I write...


Hello?

Hello?


[somber music]

Hello?

[somber music]

Son of a gun.

[somber music]


Daddy!
How is my favorite girl?


Go call your mommy for me.


Wait.

[soft piano music]


You think you can just
disappear for a week

and show up like nothing has happened?

[door slams]

[tense music]

[Roman grunts]

Hello?

Hello...

Man.

[somber music]
[Roman groaning]

Oh.

Oh, wow.


[somber music]

Ugh.

God.

No.

[somber music]

Oh.

[somber music]

It is so important to associate yourself

with people who will encourage you.

Life is not about competing
against each other

like in track, but
competing against yourself.

Who you were yesterday.

What is life really about?

Life is about money?

No.

You taught me that life is about family.

I've tried to make it
home for dinner, but...

[Roman mumbles]

So by the time I arrive,

you've already stopped wondering

if I'm gonna make it in time.

And the anger begins to set in.

What's important...

What's important...

Is what you make of your life

and the happiness, underline happiness,

is what you bring.

The happiness you bring to it.

Absolutely.

[somber music]

[cellphone buttons beeping]

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Hello?


Hi. I'm here for the party.

Where's the birthday girl?

Oh, uh, hi.

Um, she's inside.

Do you mind to keep them busy
before you start the show?

We're waiting for their
father to come home.

Sure. I'll take 'em outside
and I'll show 'em some stuff.

Excuse me. Are you hungry?

Do you want some pizza?

That's okay. I'm good.

Oh, thank you so much.

Kids, come outside.

[children shouting]

Hi.
Hi.

Come, Payton.

Hi.

[children chattering]

Hi Payton. I'm Mary.

I brought you a special
unicorn hoop today.

Can I teach you some cool tricks?

That would be so cool.

[children chattering]

Man, come on...

[somber music]

[Roman sighs]

[Roman chuckles]

My little baby.

Now there were times I've
gotten alone in the big city,

but you were always there for me.

I was afraid I wasn't
good enough for you, so,

I did the only thing I knew how. [sighs]

Oh man.

[somber music]

Yay.

But I would like to tell you, Nicole,

I love you more than
life itself. [sobbing]

Oh, Nicole.

My intention...

My intention...


My intention was to keep our
family safe and happy, always.

I am blessed.

I am blessed and happy

to have all of my family together.

To have all of my family together.

Please tell Payton, please tell Payton

I tried to get there today.

Just tell her. [sobbing]

[soft, mysterious music]

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Excuse me, is Michael there?

Who is this?

He called my garage earlier.

Did you find the car?

Ma'am, his car is parked here.

I can't give you any more information.

If you give me his address,
I could probably help.

What makes you want to help us?

He fed me lunch earlier today.

Lunch?

With a nice birthday card inside.

It's my birthday, too.

How did you get my number?

Michael Juniper gave it to me.

What's your name?

Ma'am, I spoke with a police officer.

There was an accident.

A truck crashed into a utility box.

Only one man was injured,

but they wouldn't tell me
what hospital he was in.

Did you get any other information?

No.

Okay, I'm an hour and a
half away from the city.

I have 20 kids running around the house.

Would you please give me your number

in case you get any other information?

Okay.

Okay.

Thank you.

[somber music]

Mike.


The garage just called.

There was an accident on your dad's block.

Are you serious?

We need to call the hospital
that's in the vicinity.

I'll call 'em, I'll call 'em.

[doorbell chimes]

Hey. How's it going?

Sorry we're late.

Hope we didn't miss the festivities...

Dhruv, go find Payton. Give her her gift.

What's wrong, Nic? What's wrong?

Roman hasn't called back.

Okay...

We've tried everybody,
we even tried the cops.

Okay, calm down.

[Nicole sobs]

The man called and said that there was

an accident on his block and maybe...

Slow down.

Maybe he got tired and he took a nap

or something in the office.

Yeah, I'd like to think that, but...

I highly doubt it.

Well what can I do?

I can stay here if you want.

I don't even know.

I have 20 kids running around

and by the time I get to
Manhattan, it's rush hour, so...

I'll entertain the
heck out of these kids.

Don't worry, he's going to be fine.

Okay.

Mike.

I'll meet you at the car, okay?

[children shouting in the distance]

[somber music]

Baby, come on, let's take a ride.

Can I bring my dolls?

Yes.

Uh, Payton, I'll be back. I
have to pick up dad at work.

Still?

Yeah, he had car trouble.

Do you want to, you want to come with us

or you want to stay with your friends?

Well, we already sang
happy birthday in school.

I think you should come.

[children shouting in the distance]

Ladies and gentlemen,
gather around and come see

the famous hula hoop toss.

Let's go, let's go.

Come on, girls.





Got the keys?
Yeah.



One second.
[car starts up]

Are you buckled?

[tense music]

life insurance policy

a few months ago for $1 million.

Kindly collect the money,
pay off the mortgage.

There's still 120,000 to pay off.

Use the rest to pay for
college and art supplies.

Get back and in touch
with that side of you.

I know when you became a
mom, man, you gave up a lot.

Please forgive me for that.

[tense music]


Mom, mom.

Mom?

Hey.

Hey, hey. He's gotta be
at this hospital, okay?

It's right down the
street from his office.

Okay, uh...

What don't you put the GPS and uh,

try to use the app.

You know, the new one. It
gives you the best directions.

Wait a minute. Why isn't dad at work?

He, um...

Just take a left here, okay?

I'm finding the directions.
Okay.

Let's go.

time you find this letter,

I'm not sure if I'll still be here.

[tense music]

Mike, please stay in the car.

Call the parking garage and
see if there's any updates.

Got it.
Please watch the kids, okay?

My husband is missing.

There was an accident.

I have a strong reason to believe

he was admitted to this hospital.

Name?

Roman Juniper.

When was he admitted?

I'm not sure. I'm his wife.

Hi, I'm looking for a Roman Juniper.

Okay.

We have no one by that
name here at the moment.

Is there any way to
check if he was admitted

to a different hospital?

What type of accident?

It was a car crash.

Okay.

Yes.

Can you please track?

[phone line beeping]

All right you guys, um, I'm
gonna go check on mom, okay?

Stay here.

Mike?
What?

I'm scared.

All right, you guys can come.

Come on, let's go.

Come on, fast, fast, fast.

Juniper?

Right here.

They brought a man in earlier.

He doesn't have identification,

but he fits your husband's description.

Are there any marks on his body

so that we could identify him?

Um, yes, he has a birthmark
inside his right ankle.

Okay.

Is he okay?

He's in critical condition.

When the truck hit, it
punctured his right lung.

That's not him.

I hope not.

He always has his wallet om him.

He had nothing on him at all?

No.

Nothing.

Well can you find out?

I am. I will.

It's okay, girls. It's okay.

I'm sorry.

Mommy?
It's okay.

Where's daddy?
He's okay, it's not him.

we'll look for it, okay?

charge of the eBay account.

Sell all my baseball cards,

except Shoeless Joe Jackson,

'cause that'll be worth
tons in a few years.

[melancholy music]

Susan has all the accounts
payable and receivable.

If you would like to
shut down my company...

That's up to you.

I don't want to burden you with that.

I love you.

And Mike, I wanted to come
to his next competition.

[Roman sobbing]

And my goodness, that
Lily, she is your twin.

She's your twin.

Oh, that Lily, she's my
little left handed genius.

[melancholy music]

Excuse me.

Yes?

Hi, I was called recently
about a missing person

and the family's really worried.

I'm concerned they might be
in this building right here.

Just stay calm.

If there's someone in
there, we'll find 'em.

I'm going to talk to the chief.

Okay.
I'll be right back, okay?

All right.

Thank you.
Hey chief.

This man says he's got a
friend stuck in the building.

Should I gather up the guys and go inside?

Let me notify 'em.

Command to all units, be advised,

we have a report of a person
stuck inside the building.

Please initiate procedures.

All right.

I'm going to gather up
the guys and head inside.

[Fire Chief] Okay, give me a report.

Will do.

Hey, how you doin'? I
just talked to the chief.

Just remain calm.

We're gathering up all the guys

and we're headed inside very shortly.

Okay, great. Is there anything I can do?

Stay calm. We got it under control.

Okay.

Come on guys, let's
go. Let's find this guy.

[uptempo, inspirational music]

One thing I would like
to say to all of you...

Never leave your work pending.

When then you start
something, you must finish it.

Nobody's ever half-finished
in this family.

And...

Please,

please,

please, ma..


[Nicole sobbing]

You can go see him now.

and watch the kids, okay?

Come here.

[Mike sniffles]

It's okay.

It's gonna be okay.

The lights are back on.

Thank god.

[elevator pings]

It's hot as hell in here.

Sam, go get the paramedics.

Okay, Charlie. I'm on it.

It's not him.

It's not?

No.

Let's go.

Oh!

Thank god.
Let's go.

[all sobbing]

Let's go.

Come on, let's go.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Ma'am, you can't park there.
Okay, you watch me.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down.

Calm down.

Don't you tell me to calm down.

My husband, Roman, where is he?

Did you say Roman?

Okay, he was stuck in
the elevator a few hours.

He's unconscious. He's on
his way to the hospital.

On his way to Central Hospital.

Which-
Central Hospital

These are his belongings.
Are you okay, ma'am?

[Payton sobbing]

Here are his belongings.

Is my daddy all right?

He's gonna be find, sweetheart.

Why do you have his stuff?
You need to take this.

It's what was left in the elevator.

What is this?

You need to head to the hospital.

Let's go, Mike. Come on, guys.

We have to be strong for your daddy.

Come on.
[Payton sobbing]

Let me check.

Um, he's in ICU on the sixth floor.

The elevator's just back there.

Thanks.

Let's go, guys.


[elevator beeping]
[soft, somber music]

Hi, excuse me.

My husband Roman Juniper
was admitted here.

What's going on?

He's still unconscious.

We're doing our best.

He's suffering from idiopathic
ventricular fibrillation

from the shock, but don't worry.

He's getting the absolute best treatment.

I will let you know as soon
as there is any update.

[soft, melancholy music]

So much pressure on me and every day

and the anger begins to set in.

I took out a life insurance policy

a few months ago for one...

It is so important to associate yourself

with people who will encourage you.

You taught me that life is about family.

I would like to tell you, Nicole,

I love you more than life itself.

My intention was to keep
our family safe and happy.

I am blessed.

I am blessed.

Please tell Payton I tried to get there.

Nicole, I know when you became a mom,

man, you have up a lot.

Please forgive me for that.

By the time you find this letter,

I'm not sure if I'll still be here.

What's wrong, momma?

[Nicole sniffles]

It's okay.

Your dad loved us very much.

He loves us and he gives
us the best he can, okay?

Don't cry, momma.
I'm okay.

Dad's gonna be okay. I promise.

I know he'll be okay.

[Payton sobbing]

Mike.

Could you please go get
us some snacks or...

I'm really not hungry.

Mike, please.

I don't know, get them, like muffins or...

I'm kind of hungry.
Thank you, Mike.

Yup.

Come on, girls.

Come on.

Thank you.
Mm-hm.

[melancholy music]

[Nicole sobbing]

[melancholy music]

[machines beeping]

Start the levophed drip.

It's not working.
We're going to lose him.

[doctor sighs]

Go get his wife. He's
not going to survive.

Okay.

Just you.

[somber, tense music]

[machine buzzing]

What's happening?

What's going on?

I'm sorry.

We couldn't save him.

Mrs. Juniper.

You're their only mom.
Mom.

Mommy, wake up.

I brought you this muffin.

Thank you, Lily.

His blood pressure is

We can't lose him. We

Okay.

His blood pressure's dropping again.

If you pray, please pray for him.

No.
No.

Come here.

I love you.

I need you.


I don't care if you come home late or...

Everybody's here.


I'll wear the old dress.

I love the old dress. [sobbing]

Dad?

I don't know if you can hear me,

but I need you to wake up.

I'll be whatever you want me to be.

I'll be a math teacher.
I'll get 100% on every test.

I don't need those stupid shoes.

I'll come in first every time without it,

but I need you to wake up.

[machine buzzing]

Mommy, I don't like
those straight lines.

Make them go away.

Mommy, I told you I don't
like straight lines.

Oh thank god.

[machine beeping]

All right, everyone has

Come on, we have to take care of your dad.

He's stabilized.

You can come see him now,

You're back.
Hey baby.

Hello, darling.
