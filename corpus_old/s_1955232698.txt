The mind plays tricks on you.

Now you see me,

now you don't.

You better be careful.

We're watching you.

Get out.

Now.

Teresa?

How was Mexico?

You okay?

Talk to me.

I'm thinking of doing
something bad.

Doesn't matter if it's bad,

but a knife like that is not
going to get you very far.

I know where we can
find a lot of money.

I just don't want to

do it alone.

How many people know about it?

Well,

my brothers and my sister.

That's too many people.

Look, the first rule
of being a criminal,

don't steal with more
than two people.

I really need you on this.

This is our chance.

We could have all this money and get
the things that we really want.

I, I don't think we can.

Please.

Where's grandma?

Gavin?

Gavin, open up.

I know you're in there.

Who told you I was here?

Hannah.

Lovely.

Yeah.

She's been a rat ever since
we were little kids.

You know,

I really hate seeing
you living like this.

Well, are you going
to ask why I'm here?

You know, what
difference does it make?

Why don't you just say your bullshit
speech and just leave, okay?

You know what?

I should just let you drive this
piece of shit van right back

down joy road over there, so you
can find out what just happened.

They found grandma dead.

What?

Oh my God.

Don't start that shit now.

I know you and I know these
tears they don't mean shit!

How can you say that shit to me?

I mean look how I'm living.

Oh, so what?
You're going to blame me now?

It's my fault?

Do you, do you remember when you
wanted to turn eighteen so badly?

Well, here it is. Guess what?

This is adulthood

in full effect.

It's sink or swim now kid because
you're not a little girl anymore.

And these tears, nobody
gives a shit about them.

No one cares that you're crying.

No one cares that you're broke.

And no one gives a shit if
you live in a fucking van!

Hello.

Hi.

I'm sorry.

I was just looking
at your purse.

Excuse me?

Yeah, it's, um, really pretty.

Well, thank you.

So, is that hot
chocolate or coffee?

Not that it matters.

Yeah, um, I just wanted

to buy a hot chocolate,

but, this is embarrassing, but I
don't have enough money so...

Well, I think I can help you.

Thank you.

$5?

Is that really all you
could come up with?

You're kidding?

No, um, actually,
actually I'm not.

So, why don't you reach into

that pretty little purse
and try a little harder.

You're crazy.

You're not getting this $5 back.

I don't know if you noticed but
I'm a police officer and you

know you need to go get a job.

I've been looking for a job
actually, um, for months

and not a single one called me so...
um, I lost my mom,

I lost grandma, I lost my house.

So, don't act so
surprised, okay?

Because you know the same thing

that happened to me
could happen to anyone.

I'm sorry.

I'm really sorry.

We got a call from DPD.

I was put on the case two days
after we found the grandmother.

We began our search in the
woods looking for where her

granddaughter Gavin had
parked and lived in her van.

We'd like to talk to the oldest

granddaughter Teresa,
but no one's seen her.

So, what do you really think
happened to the grandmother?

I don't know.

Well, how do you
feel about the case?

I don't.

It doesn't look like anything is
going to show up here either.

That's good coffee.

Come in.

Kelogg?

That's me.

Like the breakfast of champions.

Speaking of champions, to the
right is investigator Zod.

To the left my assistant.

I assume the administrator
at the agency contacted you?

She sure did.

Hold on.

Right.

Have a seat.

I can't sit when my
company is losing money.

Then let's get down to business.

I'll need names, addresses, shoe
sizes, bra sizes, the works.

My company makes
$100 million a year.

The money goes from the
customer's account to us.

The customer contacts us to cash
in, if we have to pay, we pay.

If we don't, we don't.

My job is to find a
reason not to pay.

Sounds like you got a
pretty fucked up job.

It's a fucked up world.

And then some.

And we're all in it.

What about you Zod?

Standing here for a few
minutes, haven't said a word.

You talk?

Only when I've got
something to say.

That works.

What about you sweetheart?

You just another pretty face?

She's fucking useless unless you
want a blowjob as a partial payment.

I never mix business
with pleasure.

That's my motto.

The envelope please.

Everything you need to start

is either in that envelope
or in Zod's head.

I hope Zod doesn't let us down.

I don't get let down, Kelogg.

I'm the guy that sends the
letters to the clients letting

them know that their
claim has been denied,

especially if it ain't legit.

All right.

Give me a few days and
I'll get back to you.

Thanks for your time.

Thank you.

Any reason why
you're still here?

Well, I thought we'd take a few
minutes to get to know each other.

Well, I hate to let you
down, but I'm not looking

to get to know anybody.

So, if you don't mind...
So, you want me to leave?

Well, you catch on fast.

Aren't you ready to work?

Well, I'm not doing anything
until this check clears.

So, you want me to leave?

You're starting to get
on my nerves, Zod.

So, in plain English
take a walk.

Get the fuck out of here!

It's been a long day.

Hey, you okay?

Mexico didn't work out.

Gavin can't be trusted.

She went there without us.

There's now two people missing.

The second being
Teresa's brother red.

One picture tells it all.

â™ª Eery music â™ª

How are you today?

I've been better.

Well, let's just get down
to business, shall we?

Your grandmother set up a trust

fund for all the family members
named on this document.

My name is on there, right?

Yes, of course,

but due to the terms of
the agreement we need the

signatures of all the parties.

All four beneficiaries,

including yourself.

Um, I was hoping Blake

would be here.

Oh, yes.

He was here.

He signed both copies and left.

What?

Hmm-mm.

Um, would you mind if

I take some time to
look over these?

But I was hired to do that.

I, I know...

I just want to fully understand what
I'm signing through my own eyes.

Oh, so now you're
practicing law.

Is that how it is, young lady?

No. Um, actually,

I want to have my own
attorney look at this.

Why?

Excuse me?

What's the matter?

You don't trust me?

No.

Hmm, fine.

Don't sign it.

Fine by me.

Don't sign a damn thing.

Let me explain something to you.

All that matters is what's
written on this document.

Not your views, not your
opinions, and not your lawyer.

So, if I were you I'd
give it a chance,

you know.

Roll the dice and

sign on the dotted line.

Let's go.

Sign it.

Piece of shit!

Piece of shit?

If I'm a piece of shit then what
the fuck does that make you?

You're the one living
in a goddamn van.

Why? Just tell me why
did you go to the

attorney's office
and then leave?

Leave before I got there?

Why?
What's the big problem?

You know what my problem is?

Fucking you know what
I've been going through.

I have no place to live.

I'm living in a fucking van
picking through garbage while

you're fucking eating real food.

Shut up.
That's what my problem is.

Come on.
Shut up.

Gavin, come on.
No.

You know what?
You come on.

I mean I used to think, I
used to think that you

actually cared about
me, but now I know.

Now I know you don't
give a shit about me.

So,

that's what you think?

You think I don't give a shit?

You know what your problem is?

Is that you never appreciate a

goddamn thing that anybody
does for you ever!

Give me something to
appreciate and I fucking will!

God!

I don't even know who
you are anymore.

I'm your goddamn sister.

That's who I am.

But you know what
that means to me?

It only means that we came
from the same fucking mother.

I hate you.

Fuck!

Fuck!

Fuck!

Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

Kelogg.

Can I help you guys?

Maybe we can help you.

You can start by telling me why
the fuck you got my sunglasses.

They were sitting on that
table over there before.

So nobody would take them.

You guys cops?

You looking to make
a police report?

Have a seat.
Come on.

Go ahead.

You haven't
answered my question.

You still haven't answered mine.

Well, fire away.

I'm attorney Kelogg.

This is investigator Zod.

And this is good coffee.

It sure is.

Listen, I know you guys aren't here
about talking about no goddamn coffee.

And now that I know that
you're both not cops,

you guys got about two minutes before
I kick you the fuck out of here.

The insurance company has a few questions
to ask about the death of your grandmother.

What do you want to know?
She's dead.

Just a couple of questions.

Just a couple of questions?

What the fuck are
you looking at?

Just answer the man's questions.

Fine.

I'll answer one question and you

better make it a good one.

Well,

I'm not going to kiss your
ass to get this information.

You don't want to talk to me?

Then don't.

Great.

Then you and your buddy can
get the fuck out of here.

I think we better leave before

something happens that
we'll be very sorry for.

Your sister is still
living in a van.

Who cares?

You're all hard Blake.
Change your mind,

you want to talk, call me.

I'm listed.
Kelogg.

Like the corn flakes.

Excuse me?

Hello?
Can I get some towels please?

My room is out of towels.

Hello?

Hey, um, it's me.

Just listen, okay?

I used the spare key

and I put, um, an envelope in a
shoebox under your bed, okay?

And, um, just don't
try to contact me.

Don't try to call me
or text or anything.

Let's just let this whole thing
play out and we'll talk after.

No. Please. No.

No. No. No.

No. No.

What am I doing here?

Gavin, Gavin.

We see you Gavin.

We know why you're here.

Do you?

It's very important that you follow
our instructions or you may die.

What?

Tell us about Mexico.

I have no idea what
you're talking about.

Aw, you disappoint us Gavin.

Is this someone's idea
of a fucking joke?

What the fuck are you writing?

There are two types of
drinks in front of you.

One of them you'll love,

which one will it be?

I drank the fucking
water, asshole.

It's hot in here.

Hello, motherfucker.

You're one annoying
son of a bitch.

Red head. Red head.

Ready to talk?

Talk? About what?

The fucking weather?

Tell us about Mexico.
Starts with the letter "M."

Assholes.

You guys said I'd figure it out.

You said if I thought hard

enough this fucking brain of mine
would figure out why I'm here.

Well, I can't.

What the fuck you keep
looking at me for?

Shall I add some more

piss to it?

Fuckers.

Dirty girl.

Oh, dirty girl.

We're watching you.

We're watching you.

We're watching you.

When someone goes missing

the answer is usually
right under your nose.

Someone trusted someone
they shouldn't have.

You just have to figure it out.

Hello?

It's me.

Are you busy?

No, I'm not.

I'd rather be getting drilled
right about now by Jimmy,

but that's not happening.

Why?

What's up?

I need to talk.

Okay, so start talking.

Well, I wanted to come by.

Well, drop by.

Wait, wait, wait.

You're not parked outside or some
strange shit like that are you?

No.

All right.

Well, I'll be here.

Okay, bye-bye.

Digging for gold?

Nope.

Digging for gold means
digging up my ass.

Got anymore piss
for me to drink?

Why don't we have a talk?

Fuck you.

I don't want to talk to you.

You don't have a choice.

Hey, I do have a choice.

Fucking piece of wood.

Oh!

Red,

you must cooperate or your
scheduled time will end sooner.

Scheduled time?

You are as nasty and
evil as we thought.

Meaning what?

It will be harder for
us to kill your soul.

It will take longer for
your heart to stop,

but don't worry it will.

Red's going to die.

Red's going to die.

Let me tell you something.

Before you brought me here,
before all this bullshit,

my life was dead anyway.

So, if you think you want
to kill me, go right ahead.

Oh, shit.

Maybe the urine is finally
flushing out your soul.

Ugh, please.

I need to take a shit.

Go right ahead.

Ugh.

Need some toilet paper?

Hey.

Fuck.

Okay, Hannah.
What's going on?

I haven't been able to sleep.

Well, I can understand that.

You've been through a lot.

A lot has happened.

Yeah, I tried talking to my
mom and she won't believe me.

She just won't
fucking believe me.

Believe what?

I can show you better

than I can tell you.

Okay. Now, if you have to

warn me about something
now would be a good time.

No surprises.

Okay.

I'll be right back.

Are you expecting anybody?

Ah!

It's just me.

God, don't fucking
do that shit again.

Fuck.

We found out about Mexico.

How, how did you
know about that?

That was a secret.

You had a secret.

We know your secret.

You've been a bad girl.

You like that?

Finally, something I do
gets your attention.

Red, red.

Shit.

Stop.

I knew it.

Why don't you just stay
the fuck out of this?

I was entertaining that guy.

Not you.

We know about your
anger problem, red.

Are you angry, red?

Or does this have to do

with your impotence?

How do you know that?

Where are you getting
this information?

That's it.

May as well face reality.

Never going to get
out of here alive.

Fuck.

We have asked you
to cooperate but you

have refused.

Still, you have survived

longer than expected.

We have studied you and even

though you're alive right now we
believe that soon you will be dead.

Please.

You are weak.

Staying alive is not an option.

Please, help me.

There's pleasure in

watching you suffer.

The pleasure of

watching you die.

Don't look at my master.

Look at me!

Look at me!

Why?

Why are you doing this?

There is no reason.

No one can help.

No one can help you.

Soon you'll be dehydrated.

Soon you'll lose
touch with reality.

Soon your heart will stop.

Dirty girl.

Oh, dirty girl.

Oh, dirty girl.

Door is locked.

I see that.

You work here or are you a cop?

Most people come here are either
cops or looking for work.

Anyone here?

Go to the back door, knock,

and start praying.

Hi, I'm detective Smith, DPD.

What do you want?

I'm investigating the disappearance
of an employee here, red Cason.

Did you know him?

Did or do?

Because I'm pretty sure those
mean two different things.

Okay, do you know him?

Yeah, I knew him.

But I don't know you.

Do you mind if I
take a look around?

Owner is not here.

I just want to take
a look around.

Look, I put my paycheck

in the gas tank, I
have two kids, no man.

You expect me to just
let you walk in here?

No.

I think I'd like some cash.

All right, thank you.

Excuse me.

I knew the secretary
was full of shit,

but I have to do what I have
to do to make sense of this.

I'm scared.

I don't even really
know this guy.

I just got a message saying
to come to his office.

Can we trust him?

He's an attorney.

Yeah, how do you know that?

Come in.

Have a seat.

Why is she here?

Is she your lover?

She's my friend.

I prefer to speak to you
on this matter alone.

Really?

Then why is he here?

I don't know that fucker.

Hannah.

I pulled a few strings.

Had the investigator check into

the documents for the trust
your grandmother set up.

My mom gave me the original
when I turned 18 and said

I had money coming.

Well, it doesn't say that now.

Who changed it?

That we don't know.

Sir, I'm not trying

to get anything.

I mean if I have money
coming that's fine,

but my other relatives didn't
even have the decency to

give her a fucking funeral.

There's two wills.

You can go to court,
challenge the authenticity

of the second one,
but that's about it.

I'm sorry.

My mom told me that my
grandmother kept money,

like literally hid
money everywhere.

You got a map for it?

Otherwise it's finder's keepers.

Thank you.

Hannah, I've got one question.

What in the hell
happened in Mexico?

Gavin's mom disappeared there.

And did any of the authorities
get back to you at all?

No.

Well, now that's strange.

Because we were told that
they found her alive.

What?

Where is she?

My mom is worried sick.

We were hoping that you would
tell us what's going on.

Yeah. Aside from what we already
know, like the fact that you have a

strange fucking family and right
now we can't find any of them.

Can I go now?

Who asked you to stay?

You got something to say?

I didn't think so.

And close the door.

There's a draft.

I never could make
those circles.

Neither could I.
I've been smoking for years.

I can't do it.

It takes talent.

It does.

Morris, DPD.

You work for Goldstein?

Yes, I do.

Is he available?

I'm sorry, but
nobody is here today.

Well, you're here.

Well, I'm just here to
finish some paperwork.

I see.

You guys drafted a
will for a family.

This will was... Yes, Gavin was
here and so was her brother.

And we gave them as
well as the others

a full understanding
of the will.

I'm not here about the will.

This is now a murder
investigation.

So, any information that
you or attorney Goldstein

can give me would help.

Detective, we don't
give information about

our cases or our clients
for any reason.

Now, if you'll excuse me.

Just one more thing.

Who hired you to draft the
will in the first place?

Keep trying, detective.

Because guesswork is the only way
you'll get anything out of me.

Surprise, surprise.

I don't think I told you.

I don't like surprises

except on my birthday.

Could've got yourself killed.

Listen.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

you move again and the first
bullet goes in your nut sack.

Whoa. I just came
here to talk Kelogg.

Put the gun away.

Okay.

Start talking.

Kelogg.

Now where would someone get
a name like Kelogg from?

Yeah.

I think my mother
was using drugs.

Why did you come to see me?

I go see a lot of people.

Don't mean shit.

Anyway, your grandmother

had a half a million dollar

insurance policy but I'm
sure you know about that.

And what's the problem?

The problem is that everyone

who's a beneficiary is
missing except you.

The insurance company thinks that's
a little more than a coincidence.

And what about Hannah?

Yeah.

What about Hannah?

The masked man.

And I don't mean
the lone ranger.

What do you know about
the interviewer?

The golden elephant?

Stop this.

You're not even a cop.

Not anymore.

But I know a rat when I see one.

Where's the money, bitch?

What money?

You've got five seconds.

One, two, three, four.

Okay.

Where?

Upstairs.

Where?
Under the bed.

Upstairs under the bed.

Go take it out.

You better be telling
me the truth, bitch.

Hey, boss.

Did you check it?

Is it all there?

It's all I found.

Where's the rest of it?

That's it.

I swear.

Sweet smell of money.

Nice doing business with you.

Have a good day, doll.

Let's go.

Here's your keys.

Gavin. You have a visitor.

This man has done no harm,

committed no crime,

and yet his fate lies

in your hands.

If you will not talk
to save yourself,

perhaps you will to
save an innocent.

Decide quickly.

Do not hesitate.

Time's up.

Hungry, Gavin?

You wouldn't even
help a stranger.

Would you help a child?

She's fresh, innocent.

Why don't you help her?

Help her.

Please, help me.

Just as we thought.

She won't even help a child.

So very disappointing.

Still hungry?

Go ahead.

Take a bite.

She was so sweet.

Wasn't she?

Last chance to talk.

You know, you did
this to her, Gavin.

How does that make you feel?

By not cooperating

you have sealed her fate.

And now you have also
sealed your fate.

Can you live with that?

Please, help me.

Please, help me.

Please, help me.

Help me.

Please, please.

Help me.

Help me.

Please, help me.

I want to get out
of here please.

Get me out of here.

Please get me out of here.

Please let me out.

Let me out.

Hey, Nancy is here.

Talk to her.

You okay?

Do I look like I'm okay?

I just had five guys break in
here and shove guns in my face.

Well, whatever is going
on you know I'm here.

Nance, I'm not who

you think I am.

What do you mean by that?

My cousin Gavin stole
$300,000 from our

grandmother's house
and we've split it,

but it was supposed
to be a secret.

Our secret.

How the fuck did they
know I had money in here?

They had keys to my house.

How the fuck did they
get keys to my house?

What are we going to do?

We?

I'm not in this shit.

But I just needed
you to help me.

No, I told you I
wasn't getting involved.

I told you.

But we're friends.

No, we're friends, yeah.
But I'm not going

to let you fuck up my life.

Nance, like I've never
done anything for you?

Like you've never
done shit to me?

You know what I'm talking about.

I never said I was innocent.

Not one time did I ever
say I was innocent.

But you know what Hannah?

I never put your life in danger.

What should I do now?

I'm not going to
even answer that.

Gavin, are you scared?

I have a letter for you.

More bullshit.

Gavin, you are not in a
position to respond.

If I were you, I'd listen.

A decision has been made
based on your evaluation.

Within 24 hours,

you will die.

Why are you looking
at me like that?

Peace, Gavin.

You got any cigarettes in there?

Your jokes are not funny.

Seeing that your death is near,

a decision was made.

A decision?

On what?

Why don't you fuckers
just kill me already?

Huh?

Just kill me.

Kill me!

Actually, if it were up to me

I'd cut your hands off and
let you bleed to death.

Your evaluation is complete.

Hey.

She's dead.

She's dead.

She's dead.

She's dead.

I told you.

Move. Vamanos!

Hola. Buenas noches.

Whatever you just said would
be great if I spoke Spanish.

Any numbers yet?

No.

Priceless.

I like that word.

Priceless.

Make a wish.

Wishes can't come
true without cash.

But what we're talking about is
worth much, much more than cash.

Yes. I can see it.

Ah, yes.

The day is coming.

Oh my God.
Oh my God.

Oh my God.

What are you doing here?

I don't know.

If both of us are here
then what about...?

I hope not.

My other sister is
not here, right?

Talk to me.

Come on!

Where's my goddamn sister?

If it wasn't for Blake
I'd be dead right now.

Just the way you
wanted it, right?

I'm sorry, momma.
Shut the fuck up.

You tried killing
your own mother.

I'm sorry, mom.

But growing up in your
house was bullshit.

I mean every fucking month
you had a new boyfriend.

You even fucked my boyfriend.

And then when he started bragging
about it at school that was it.

And fuck Mexico.

I wanted to kill you right then.

Well, I guess we just
hate each other, don't we?

But what I want to know
is who killed grandma?

I did.

She was sick.
She was ill.

And she wanted to die
and I took care of it.

You took care of it?

You both treated her like shit.

And when I found out what you did,
even though you're my goddamn kids

I knew I had to get you back.

And that's why I
took you to Mexico.

And when you found out about it,
you tried to flip it around.

Payback is a motherfucker.

Oh my God.
Oh my God.

All right, please stop.

Please, oh my God.

Please!

Oh my God.
Stop.

Listen, get off of him.

Please.

No. Oh my God.

No, no, no, no.

Oh my God.
Oh my God.

No.

Take off that mask
you motherfucker.

Ready to pay?

Did you really think you were
going to get away Hannah?

Billy.
