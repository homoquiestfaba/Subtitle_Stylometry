CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY 
    ARTISAN HOME ENTERTAINMENT

YOU BLAME ME?

YES.

OH, OF COURSE.

YES, BECAUSE I KNOW             
HOW TO LOVE.

I KNOW HOW                      
TO ABANDON MYSELF.

AND I HAVEN'T?

I WROTE THE PART
                FOR YOU.

WHAT MORE CAN I DO?

I CAN'T GUARANTEE   
            ITS ACCEPTANCE.

MAYBE YOU LOST                  
YOUR TOUCH.

MY TOUCH?

MAYBE YOU'RE LOST.

MAYBE YOU'RE DROWNING.

MAYBE YOU'RE                    
ON YOUR WAY DOWN.

WHAT IF I AM?

I'LL BE ASSOCIATED              
WITH YOUR DECLINE.

THEY'LL JUDGE ME                
FINISHED, TOO.

THEN DESERT ME.

I CANNOT.

YOU FOOL.

WHY NOT?

YOU ASK WHY.

BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

GOOD. WE'RE GETTING 
            SOMEWHERE.

ONCE--ONCE MORE.

FROM WHERE?

FROM YOUR,          
            UH, SELFISHNESS.

YES, YES.                       
YOU LOST YOUR TOUCH.

YOU'RE FINISHED,

AND THEY'LL JUDGE   
            ME FINISHED, TOO.

THEN DESERT ME.

HOW CAN YOU SUGGEST 
            SUCH A THING?

WHY DO YOU ADD THAT,            
RACHEL?

YOU CAN'T ADD THAT.

THE SCENE NEEDS IT.

BUT YOU WERE ABOUT TO           
DECLARE YOUR LOVE FOR HIM.

YES, EXACTLY.

AND AT SUCH A POINT

YOU CAN'T ASK HIM   
            A QUESTION.

WE'RE BUILDING      
            TO THAT CLIMAX.

YOU CAN'T WANDER    
            AWAY FROM IT.

I KNOW EXACTLY                  
WHAT THE POINT IS.

I CAN CARRY             
        THE EXTRA WORDS.

NO, NO, NO, NO.                 
THE RHYTHM IS ALL WRONG.

IT MUST GO,                     
"THEN DESERT ME."

"I CANNOT."

"YOU FOOL,                      
WHY NOT?"

"YOU ASK WHY."

"BECAUSE I LOVE YOU."

IT DOESN'T WORK.

I'M SURPRISED                   
YOU DON'T SEE THAT.

YOU'RE TELLING ME   
            HOW TO WRITE?

SOMEONE BETTER.

SO, THAT'S WHAT YOU 
            REALLY BELIEVE?

I'M FIXING THE SCENE.

YES, BY GIVING YOURSELF 
        MORE LINES.

IF NECESSARY.                   
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO,

COMPOSE THE PLAY FOR YOU?

[CROWD CHEERING]

[VENDORS SHOUTING]

Astergourd: NO, NO, NO.

WE ARE NOT SELLING TICKETS  
        FOR<i>  ILLUMINATA.</i>

TUCCIO'S NEW PLAY       
        IS UNDER DISCUSSION.

IN A MOMENT, DARLING.

WOULD YOU LIKE A TICKET 
        FOR TONIGHT'S PREMIERE

PERFORMANCE OF        
        <i>  CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA?</i>

ALSO WITH               
        THE EXCEPTIONAL RACHEL.

SUCH A STUPID   
                PEOPLE.

TUCCIO'S PLAY. CHRIST.

MOVE AROUND SOME MORE.

DON'T I GET ANY USE             
OUT OF THOSE BRITCHES?

AN OPENING CANNOT       
        SUCCEED WITHOUT TEARS.

I ONLY HOPE UMBERTO BEVALAQUA   
GIVES US A GOOD REVIEW.

Marta: THEY KILLED HIM!

THEY KILLED MY SON!

MY SON!


UH-UH, NO.

START FRESH.            
        DO IT AGAIN.

I WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,   
        IF YOU MUST KNOW.

I WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,

IF YOU MUST KNOW.

        I WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,

IF YOU MUST KNOW.

I...

WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,     
        IF YOU MUST KNOW.

YOU LIKE THAT ONE?

NO, NO GOOD.

NO, I HAVE A BETTER ONE.

I WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,   
        IF YOU MUST KNOW.

[WOMAN MOANING]

OHH, LEFT.

LEFT, LEFT, LEFT.


LEFT, LEFT.

THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.


OHH! OHH!

OH, YEAH!                       
OH, GOD!

OH, I'M GONNA BE--

OHH, OHH, OHH!

I'M ALMOST--

ALMOST--

I'M ALMOST HAPPY!


ALMOST?

[HORSE WHINNIES]

Man: CELIMENE!

CELIMENE!

CELIMENE!

CELIMENE!

CELIMENE!

MADAME,             
            YOU ARE A MIRACLE.

I THROW MYSELF      
            AT YOUR FEET.

I DO THE BEST I CAN.

A TENDER DEPTH.

A VOICE LIKE THE PUREST 
        SILVER PLATE

AT THE BOTTOM       
            OF THE PUREST WELL.

THE RESONANCE OF    
            A THOUSAND HARPS.

A GODDESS.

YOU ARE             
            THE SINGLE LIGHT

IN A THEATER        
            BLACK AS DEATH.

GO ON.

AH, THERE YOU ARE.

ON THE FLOOR, AS USUAL.

HOW IS IT POSSIBLE

2 DAYS AGO YOU TOLD ME          
THAT YOU LOVED ME?

MISS...

UM...

THAT IS HOW I SHALL LOOK        
10 YEARS FROM NOW.

I'M BEGINNING TO BE ABLE        
TO PLAY INGENUES.


I LAUGHED SO HARD           
    I NEARLY PLOTZED.

HA HA HA!   
HA HA HA!

Woman: OUT OF MY WAY!   
        BEVALAQUA!

YOU CRITICIZE EVERYONE, 
        UMBERTO BEVALAQUA!

YOU CRITICIZE GOD!

BECAUSE HE MADE MISTAKES.

HE STILL MAKES THEM.

OH, YOU FILTHY  
                ATHEIST.

THE HORROR OF HUMAN         
    EXPRESSION. SHIELD ME.

YOU ARE JUST            
        A HORRIFYING, HORRIBLE

DEGENERATE OF A MAN!    
        CRITIC!

YOU DON'T LIKE ANYTHING!

I DON'T LIKE WOMEN              
WITH MUSTACHES.

I DON'T LIKE CELIMENE         
  OR STANDING IN LINE,

GORGONZOLA, HEARING PEOPLE      
TALK ABOUT CELIMENE,

IBSEN, CONSTIPATION,

CELIMENE FORNICATING            
WITH A BEAUTIFUL MAN,

POLITICAL PLAYS,                
REALISTIC PLAYS, LONG PLAYS.

ANY PLAY WITH CELIMENE.

HAIR ON THE BUTTOCKS.

THESE THINGS AND YOU,           
I DON'T LIKE. EXCUSE ME.

Man: UMBERTO BEVALAQUA  
        IS HERE!

OHH!    
OHH!

BITCH.

GET AWAY. GET AWAY.

BRING IT DOWN!                  
BRING IT DOWN!

SIMONE! SIMONE!

WAIT! TELL ME!      
            WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
            "ALMOST"?

HOW CAN YOU BE      
            ALMOST HAPPY?

LEAVE ME ALONE! I'M             
IN SEARCH OF NEW EMOTIONS!

SIMONE! SIMONE!

I FEEL NOTHING                  
FOR YOU, BEPPO!

I FEEL SOMETHING FOR YOU.

YOU ARE INCAPABLE               
OF CULMINATION!

YOU'RE LATE.    
                YOU'RE FIRED.

HA HA HA!

HE WAS FINISHING        
        HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY--

<i>  EGOTISM AND BANALITY.</i>

YOU KNOW, BEPPO,                
I ONCE FASHIONED YOU

AS A LITTLE DOG                 
SNAPPING AWAY AT MY HEELS,

SO I'D OCCASIONALLY             
STOP TO KICK YOU.

BUT NOW, LIKE DUST,

YOU SETTLE AND ARE IGNORED.

AH, THE FLY IS NOT  
            WITHOUT HIS STING.

PREPARING FOR           
    YOUR BIG ROLE, DOMINIQUE?

AH, HA HA. IMBECILE.

IT'S THE FIRST TIME             
IN MY ENTIRE CAREER

THAT I'VE EVER BEEN ASKED       
TO DO A WALK-ON ROLE.

FIRST TIME.

VERY FIRST TIME.

I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

YOU NEED TO TALK.   
            WHAT ABOUT MY NEEDS?

WHEN CAN I MEET YOU?

LATER. WHEN I'M HERE.   
        WHEN I'M PRESENT.

[AUDIENCE CHATTERING]

EXCUSE ME.

ARE YOU GOING TO DO     
        MY PLAY TOMORROW OR NOT?

IF I KNEW, DON'T YOU            
THINK I'D TELL YOU?

I CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS,    
    HOPING, HOPING, HOPING.

ONE MUST HOPE.

THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE      
        COME TO THE THEATER FOR.

IT'S HOW I LIVE MY LIFE.

I MUST SEE YOUR PLAY    
        BEFORE I SHOW IT.

NOW, BE PATIENT.        
        AH, CONTESSA FONSECA.

YOU READ THE PLAY.          
THE SET'S ABOUT TO BE FINISHED.

RACHEL WANTS TO DO IT.

WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE ABOUT 
    THE LEGITIMACY OF MY WORK?

I'M NO ONE.                     
I'M JUST THE PERSON

WHO OWNS THE THEATER.           
BE PATIENT.

Orlandini:                  
    5 MINUTES.

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

I'M NOT GOING TO TALK.

YOU CAN TALK. I'M NOT   
        GOING TO RESPOND.

ACTUALLY,               
        THIS LEVEL'S NOT BAD

IF YOU DON'T MIND       
        TALKING IN A WHISPER.

MOTHER!

AHEM.                   
        I CAN'T FIND MY VOICE.

PBLBIBLBLBLT!

EVER SINCE I WAS        
        TO PLAY THE LEAD,

I'VE BEEN TALKING       
        TO TOO MANY PEOPLE.

EVERYONE WANTS          
        TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

WHY DID SHE CAST HIM?           
IT'S HOPELESS.

[CLICKING TONGUE]

MY DEAR?

YES?

ARE YOU TO PLAY     
            TONIGHT?

WHY, YES.                       
AS MAMA NUNZIA, SEE?

YES, OF COURSE.     
            OF COURSE.

AND WHO'S           
            TO PLAY UNCLE BRASI?

WHY, YOU, TO BE SURE,           
FLAVIO.

ARE YOU NOT DRESSED             
FOR THE PART, YES?

GOD HELP ME.

MY MEMORY HAS LEFT ME,  
        I'M AFRAID.

THIS IS NO PROFESSION   
        FOR AN ADULT.

WHERE'S MY HAT?

WHERE'S MY CHARACTER?

I HAVE NO CHARACTER     
        WITHOUT MY HAT!

Flavio:         
                BEPPO, MY HAT!

RAHH! YAH!

AND NEXT TIME                   
I'LL SUCK OUT YOUR LIVER.

OH, HERE THEY COME.

BASTARDS.

FUCK YOU.

HEH. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
        FUCK YOU.

FUCK YOU!

THEY WON'T DO MY PLAY.

THEY'RE HUMORING ME             
FOR RACHEL'S SAKE.

            THEATER OWNERS.

THOSE LACK-BRAINS KNOW  
        IT'S MY COMEBACK ROLE.

TUCCIO, I'M         
            MORE DEVOTED TO YOU

THAN TO             
            THE ENTIRE WORLD.

"TO THE ENTIRE WORLD."

WHO DOESN'T REMEMBER    
        THAT LINE, EH?

ALL THOSE YEARS AGO?

Celimene: OH, LOOK AT       
    HOW MANY UGLY PEOPLE

THERE ARE IN THE WORLD.

NO WONDER THEY PAY US       
        SO MUCH MONEY.

CELIMENE IS LOOKING 
            THIS WAY.

SHE'S PUT ON    
                SOME WEIGHT, EH?

AH, YEAH.

OVERRATED TART.

MACARONI QUEEN.

SCORPIONS IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

THOU WHORESON LITTLE TIDY   
    BARTHOLOMEW BOAR-PIG.

HA HA HA!                       
GOOD TO SEE YOU!

WAIT FOR ME AT THE END  
        OF THE VILLAGE STREET.

I'M GOING TO GET        
        WHAT IS NECESSARY.

I'LL BE BACK.

THEN YOU...                     
                    AHH!

AH! THAT MEANS YOU HAVE         
GIVEN ME YOUR WORD.

YOU'RE A MAN,                   
NEIGHBOR TURRIDU.

WHY IS          
                MY SWORD BENT?

IT GIVES IT A HISTORY.      
    YOU'RE A CARABINIERE.

<i>  LA FIAMMA!</i>

A HEROIC ONE.               
                    RIDICULOUS.

I WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,           
IF YOU MUST KNOW.

PUBLIC HUMILIATION.

IT'S ARTISTIC       
            SUICIDE.

SEND ME ON          
            WITH NO LINES,

GIVE MY PART        
            TO PIERO.

TO PIERO! YOU'RE        
        PLAYING MY PART, CUNT!

[MUSIC BEGINS]


[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

WAS I GOOD?

BRAVISSIMO.

HOW WAS I?

BRAVISSIMO.

BEAUTIFUL       
                EASTER MORNING.

Man:                    
    LOOK, IT'S RACHEL.

EH, SANTUZZA,                   
GOING TO CONFESSION?

GO BACK IN THE HOUSE AND
        MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

ALWAYS PROVOKING.       
        BAD EXCUSE FOR A WIFE.

You can't       
                come this way.

Rachel: MAMA NUNZIA!

AH, IT'S YOU.                   
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

TELL ME WHERE       
            YOUR SON TURRIDU IS.

YOU HAVE THE GALL               
TO ASK ME THAT?

YOU LOOKING FOR TURRIDU HERE? 
  NO! HE'S NOT!

WHEN YOU WRITE...

MM-HMM?

I PRESS MY FOREHEAD AS HARD 
    AS I CAN AGAINST YOUR DOOR

TO GIVE YOU INSPIRATION.

YOU SHOULD                      
PRESS HARDER.

THERE'S A NAIL STUCK
            RIGHT INTO MY HEART.

TELL IT                         
TO THE DEAD!



I'VE COME TO CELEBRATE  
        EASTER AT HOME,

MAMA NUNZIA.

HAVE YOU ANY        
            OF THE GOOD WINE?

AH, MASTER ALFIO.               
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

I WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,   
        IF YOU MUST KNOW.

TURRIDU WAS                     
SUPPOSED TO BRING

SOME WINE BACK                  
FROM FRANCOFONTE.

YOUR SON TURRIDU    
            IS STILL HERE.

I SAW HIM THIS MORNING  
        AROUND MY PLACE.

HE WAS RUNNING LIKE     
        HE WAS IN A BIG HURRY.

QUITE ONE OF THE FAMILY NOW,
    AREN'T YOU, MISS SANTA?

LOOK THE WAY HE MOVES.

BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL MAN.

GET OUT! NOW!

NOTE THIS.

SANTUZZA...

YOU MUST THROW YOURSELF AT  
    THE FEET OF THE CRUCIFIED!

I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

HERE IN THE MIDDLE  
            OF THE STREET?

IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

TELL ME WHERE YOU WERE          
LAST NIGHT.

HO HO!

HO HO!

WHAT DOES THIS SIGNIFY?

I WAS WHERE IT                  
PLEASED ME TO BE.

I WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,         
  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW.

I WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,   
        IF YOU MUST KNOW!

THAT'S RIGHT.

YOU KIDS, SHH!                  
                    QUIET!

YOU STILL LOVE HER.

OH, SHUT--SHUT UP!

I WON'T SHUT UP!            
    I HAVE RABIES IN MY HEART!

YOU'RE CRAZY WITH               
THIS JEALOUSY OF YOURS!

YOU'RE CRAZY WITH               
THIS JEALOUSY OF YOURS!

YOU'RE ACTING LIKE              
I--I WAS A LITTLE BOY

AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT     
TO DO WHAT I WANT!

I WANT TO DO WHAT I WANT        
WHEN I WANT TO DO IT!

UNTIL NOW--THANK GOD I HAVE     
NO COLLAR AROUND MY NECK!

WHAT WILL I DO      
            IF YOU ABANDON ME?

I'M NOT!

WHAT'S HE DOING? HE'S       
    CHANGING ALL THE BLOCKING.

I'M NOT ABANDONING YOU.

THIS IS GOOD.

THIS IS SPONTANEOUS.        
    I LIKE THIS.

NO!

I AM NOT ABANDONING YOU!

KILL ME! KILL ME!

"Blood of Judas!"

I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!           
KILL ME!

DO IT.                  
                        "Judas."

I CAN'T MOVE BACKWARDS          
OR FORWARDS!

I'M TIED TO                   
  YOUR APRON STRINGS.

I DON'T KNOW WHERE              
I AM ANYMORE.

PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE ME!

TURRIDU, DON'T LEAVE ME!

TURRIDU!

"Blood of Judas."

TURRIDU, DON'T LEAVE ME!

OHH...


MOTHER!

MOTHER, EMBRACE ME NOW          
AS YOU DID WHEN I LEFT

TO BECOME A SOLDIER,            
BECAUSE TODAY IS EASTER.

TURRIDU.            
            DON'T LEAVE ME.

WONDERFUL. I'VE NEVER, EVER 
    SEEN ANYTHING SO REAL.

TURRIDU...

DON'T LEAVE ME.

TURRIDU...

GO ON WITH THE PLAY.

TURRIDU!

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS            
WHEN AN ACTOR IS MISCAST.

TURRIDU!

IS HE DEAD?

TURRIDU!

I THINK             
            THERE'S A PROBLEM.

I DIDN'T SEE
                    ANY BLOOD.

THERE ISN'T ANY BLOOD.          
IT'S A SYMBOL.

EITHER YOUR INTELLIGENCE        
IS SUFFICIENT

TO UNDERSTAND SYMBOLS           
OR IT ISN'T.

YOURS IS INSUFFICIENT.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,       
        THERE WILL BE

A BRIEF BUT SEATED...       
        INTERMISSION.

THERE IS NOTHING I LIKE BETTER  
THAN THINGS LIKE THIS.

WELL?

HE'S ALIVE.

CAN HE ACT?

I'LL PLAY   
                    TURRIDU!

YOU ARE NOT PLAYING 
            THAT PART.

IT'S ALWAYS                 
    BEEN MY PART!

I AM THE MANAGER    
            OF THIS COMPANY.

WHAT HAVE I DONE            
    TO MAKE YOU

CONTINUALLY PUNISH ME       
    THIS WAY?

"HO HO!"    
APART FROM THAT.

YOUR PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT 
    WAS A TOOTH-PULLER.

YOU FUCKED ALL DAY!

THIS BUSINESS IS        
        BASED ON FORNICATION.

"TOOTH-PULLER"?                 
THIS TIME YOU GO TOO FAR.

Flavio: SILENCE!

LET US START            
        A GENERAL TOPIC!

LET IT BE...            
    "THE ORIGINS OF DRAMA."

I WILL SPEAK SECOND.

[BOOING AND WHISTLING]

SHH!    
SHH!

I CAN SMELL POWDER.         
        I LIKE THAT.


I KNEW A MAN ONCE...

WHO ASKED HIS WIFE...

"HOW DO YOU WANT ME         
    TO LOVE YOU?"

THE MAN BECAME INFATUATED   
    WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

"DO YOU WANT ME TO LOVE YOU 
    WITHOUT SUFFERING?"

HE FORCED HIS WIFE          
    INTO THE HUMILIATION

OF INVITING THE OTHER WOMAN 
        TO DINNER.

"DO YOU WANT ME TO LOVE YOU 
        WITHOUT CRUELTY?"

HE SPENT THE ENTIRE EVENING 
    SITTING NEXT TO THIS WOMAN

WHILE HIS WIFE          
    SAT ALONE AND SILENT

LOOKING OUT A WINDOW        
    INTO THE NIGHT.

THE OTHER WOMAN             
    RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE.

HE RAN AFTER HER,           
    IN THE RAIN,

RUNNING THROUGH THE STREETS,
    SCREAMING HER NAME.

HE DIDN'T FIND HER.

HE CAME HOME.

HIS WIFE HAD DRUNK IODINE.

"HOW COULD YOU?"        
        HE SHOOK HER.

"HOW COULD YOU?"

"I CANNOT THINK OF LIFE     
        WITHOUT YOU."

SHE...VOMITED.

"DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND

"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LOVE      
    I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU

IN LOVING YOU?"

SHE WENT ON VOMITING.

"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LOVE

I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU."

WHAT A DELUSION TO BELIEVE  
    THERE IS ORDER OR LOGIC

IN THE EVENTS OF OUR LIVES.

THIS AFTERNOON          
    YOU CAME TO SEE A PLAY,

A PLAY WITH THE ACTOR PIERO 
        PLAYING A ROLE

IN WHICH HE WAS TO HAVE     
    DIED A JEALOUS DEATH,

AN IMAGINED...JEALOUS DEATH.

AND NOW...              
    THE UNIMAGINABLE HAS STRUCK.

PIERO...

OUR PIERO...

<i>  THE</i>  PIERO...

IS GONE.

YES...

HE DIES FOR REAL.

A MOMENT, PLEASE.

HE DIED?            
    HE HAD SUCH POTENTIAL.

DID HE SAY I'M DEAD?
            I'M NOT DEAD.

SHH. YOU'LL COME BACK.

Tuccio:             
    THERE IS ANOTHER PLAY

SPAWNED IN THE STORY        
    I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU.

A PLAY OF MINE...

TO BE PERFORMED TOMORROW.

<i>  ILLUMINATA.</i>

Man: LET'S SEE IT TONIGHT!

I PAID FOR A PLAY!              
I WANT TO SEE A PLAY!

YOU FLATTER ME          
    WITH YOUR ENTHUSIASM,

BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.        
        THE ACTORS--

I AM READY!

IF YOU MUST SEE IT,         
    THEN YOU LEAVE US NO CHOICE.

THIS TUCCIO...

FIND OUT            
            HOW HE TASTES.

COULDN'T WAIT.

I'M FINISHED
                    WAITING.

THE OPPORTUNITY WAS 
            THERE AND I TOOK IT.

YES, YOU TOOK IT.           
    AND WITHOUT A WORD TO ME.

I HAVE TO PERFORM IT.       
    DID YOU CONSIDER THAT?

I WOULDN'T HAVE GONE OUT THERE  
IF I DIDN'T FEEL IN MY HEART...

AND WITH ALL MY BEING...

THAT YOU WERE READY.

YOU'RE              
    THE WORST KIND OF LIAR...

BECAUSE YOUR LIES ALWAYS  
      HAVE THE RING OF TRUTH.

Astergourd:                     
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

IF THE PLAY FAILS BECAUSE YOU'RE
IN SUCH A RUSH FOR SUCCESS,

YOU WON'T HAVE                  
A SECOND CHANCE.

MY LOVE FOR YOU     
            IS TINGED WITH HATE.

AND MINE FOR YOU                
WITH ONLY LOVE.

MY LOVE--

MY LOVE FOR YOU

IS TWISTED AND  
                FOREVER ENDING.

AND MINE FOR YOU...         
    CONSISTENT AS A FLAME.


LET'S START MOVING              
THAT SCENERY.

"TWISTED AND            
        FOREVER ENDING"?

JESUS!

THAT ALMOST HIT ME!

LOOK OUT!

OPEN UP THE CAFE.           
    FIND THOSE BITCHES.

I'M GOING TO SEE BEVALAQUA.

I HAVE NO IDEA WHY  
            I MARRIED THAT MAN.

MARTA,                          
WHERE'S MY UNDERWEAR?

PUPO!

I WARNED YOU.       
            I WARNED YOU!

HE WARNED YOU!

SIMONE,             
            YOU CAME TO SEE ME.

IT'S NOT CONTAGIOUS,        
            IS IT?

THERE'S NOTHING                 
THAT COULD KILL YOU.

Simone:                 
    HAVE YOU SEEN--NO.

I'LL WAIT FOR YOU       
    UNTIL YOU COME BACK TO ME.

OR UNTIL I DIE. OR BOTH.

DON'T COME IN HERE.         
    YOU RUINED MY CAREER.

POOR PIERO.

HE WAS SO YOUNG...

AND SO UNTALENTED.

SOME ACTORS WILL DO ANYTHING    
FOR A GOOD REVIEW.

I PRAY, SIR,                    
YOU WILL NOT TAKE IT ILL

IF I DEFEND MYSELF?


IS THAT             
            PART OF THE PLAY?

AAH!

NO. NO. WHEN I CAME     
        INTO YOUR HOUSE,

MY EYES WERE INNOCENT.

NOW I SEE               
        NOTHING BUT YOU.

WHEN I--WHEN I CAME     
        INTO YOUR HOME,

MY EYES WERE INNOCENT.

NOW I SEE               
        NOTHING BUT YOU.

WHEN I--WHEN I CAME...

WHEN I CAME             
        INTO YOUR HOME,

MY EYES WERE INNOCENT.

NOW I SEE NOTHING       
        BUT YOU.

YOU...PICK UP THE LETTER.

YES.

YOU DON'T WANT TO...

BUT YOU HAVE TO.

YOU...

OPEN THE LETTER.

AND THEN YOU...

READ THE LETTER.

Pupo: AAH!

Man: HEY,                       
HOW DID IT GO?

AAH! AAH! AAH!


SHE'S NOT READING               
THE LETTER.

SHH.

HAVE FAITH.

SOMETIMES...

IT'S NOT WISE       
            TO KNOW TOO MUCH.

IT WASN'T MY IDEA               
TO TAKE THIS GIRL IN.

DON'T DEFEND YOURSELF.

TO EVERY LOVE A HISTORY.

THE GIRL HAS NO FIBER,

BUT FLUTTERS AND        
        MARVELS LIKE A CHILD

AT HER EFFECT.

IT IS HER SECRET        
        AND HER GIFT...

AND WHY YOU WISH        
        TO HOLD HER.

YOU HAVEN'T OPENED IT?

NO. IT'S            
            ADDRESSED TO YOU.

I PREFER BETRAYALS SPOKEN

FROM WHERE THEY WILL        
    GIVE ME THE MOST PAIN.

IS THAT YOUR LINE?

NO. BUT IT WORKS.               
WRITE IT DOWN.

"MY DEAREST..."

"YOU SEE ME BEFORE YOU          
ON MY KNEES LIKE AN ANIMAL."

"TAKE ME AS I TAKE YOU..."

TAKE YOU...

"MY LOVER..."

MY LOVER...

"WHO WILL MAKE ME               
DIE OF PLEASURE."

PLEASURE.

"I BITE YOUR MOUTH              
UNTIL IT BLEEDS."

UNTIL IT BLEEDS.

IF THE LIFE             
        OF PLEASURE

AROUSES SUCH            
        A THIRST IN YOU...

WHERE WILL YOU FIND     
        A WOMAN'S LOVE...

WORTHY AND PROFOUND...

THAT LIVES ONLY         
        ON SUCH PLEASURE?

LEAVE ME.

I'VE GIVEN YOU      
            EVERYTHING.

ALL OF ME.

MY LOVE...          
            MY STRENGTH...

MY YOUTH...MY LIF.

LEAVE ME.

I CANNOT.

YOU FOOL. WHY NOT?

BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.


Duke: IT WASN'T             
    VERY ENTERTAINING.

Duchessa: I DON'T COME TO       
THE THEATER TO BE ENTERTAINED.

OF COURSE, ONE NEVER
            KNOWS WHAT IS GOOD.

THAT'S WHAT         
            CRITICS ARE FOR--

TO TELL US.

ONE OF THE MOST DELICIOUS THINGS
    ABOUT SUCH GATHERINGS

IS ONE SEES PEOPLE      
    ONE THOUGHT HAD BEEN DEAD...

FOR YEARS.

Journalist: DID YOU UNDERSTAND  
THE PLAY, MADAME CELIMENE?

NO...BUT I LOVED IT.

HOW CAN YOU LOVE SOMETHING      
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?

WELL, I NEVER UNDERSTOOD
        ANY OF MY LOVERS

AND THAT                
        NEVER STOPPED ME.


Aristocrat: EXCUSE ME.

YOU WERE THAT HORRIBLE          
HUSBAND IN THE PLAY.

WELL, NOW, IT WOULD HAVE        
BEEN A MUCH BETTER PLAY

IF THE WIFE                     
HAD KILLED HERSELF.

WHAT DOES               
        UMBERTO BEVALAQUA THINK?

I KNOW                  
        YOU CAN'T TELL ME,

BUT THIS TUCCIO         
        HAS SOMETHING PERHAPS?

NOT HIM. THIS ONE. MARCO.

WITH THE LONG LASHES.

I WISH TO MEET HIM.

MARCO!

HELLO.

HI.

[WOMAN LAUGHING]

[MUSIC SWELLS]

DID YOU SEE 
                    THE PLAY?

I HATED IT.

I LOVE YOU.

YOU'RE A FOOL.


BRAVA.  
BRAVA.

BRAVA. BRAVA.

YOU ARE PURE FEMININITY...

THE FRUIT OF                    
EXTREME COMPLEXITY.

WATCHING YOU                    
FROM 20 FEET AWAY,

I FELT AS IF                    
I SLEPT WITH YOU.

THE PLAY'S THE THING

WHEREIN I'LL CATCH  
            THE CONSCIENCE

OF THE KING.

LOOK AT THAT FACE!

OH! THOSE CHEEKS.               
THAT SMILE.

WHERE ARE                       
YOUR BREASTS?

OH, THEY'RE                     
TALKING ABOUT US.

YOU THINK THEY DIDN'T   
        LIKE YOUR PLAY?

GO FIND                 
        MY DAUGHTER RACHEL

AND HAVE SEX WITH HER   
        IMMEDIATELY.

MADAME CELIMENE.    
YES.

ONE MORE QUESTION.

OH, ONE MORE.

HAVE YOU EVER       
            IN YOUR LIFE--

PROBABLY.

I HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE      
    TO HAVE SEX WITH TONIGHT.

WHAT DOES THE PRINCE            
OF PROMISCUITY SAY?

THE CRITIC.

THE ONE YOU PIMP FOR.

"I HAVE NEVER SUFFERED  
        AS MUCH IN THE THEATER.

IF THIS IS A DRAMA,     
        I AM THE POPE."

THE UNGRATEFUL CUNT.

I DID EVERYTHING        
        BUT WASH HIS WINDOWS.

"THE ONLY ACTOR BESIDES     
    RACHEL WORTH MENTIONING

"IS THE YOUNG           
        HANDSOME THESPIAN

"MARCO FANUCCI.

"HE IS A DELIGHT        
        TO THE EYE

"AND ALL THE SENSES.

HERE IS SOMEONE     
            TO WATCH."


WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

THE ONLY GOOD REVIEW YOU GOT
    WAS FROM BEVALAQUA.

I'M SORRY.

I DON'T FIND THAT FUNNY.

HE DIDN'T SAY       
            ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

IT'S POSSIBLE                   
HE SAW SOMETHING IN ME--

HE SAW SOMETHING        
        IN YOU, ALL RIGHT!

SO MUCH FOR FINE THOUGHTS.

THAT'S WHY I'VE GIVEN UP        
FINE THOUGHTS.

NO ONE CAN LIVE UP TO THEM.

NO ONE.

I WANT THOUGHTS                 
THAT I CAN LIVE UP TO.

I WANT THOUGHTS               
  THAT ARE WHO I AM,

NOT SOMEONE                     
I CAN'T EVER HOPE TO BE.

I WANT--

SIMONE.

ARE YOU REHEARSING          
FOR YOUR BENEFIT OR FOR MINE?

HAVE YOU SEEN           
        THE REVIEWS?

NO, NO, I HAVEN'T.

WHY? DID THEY SAY               
SOMETHING ABOUT ME?

ABOUT YOU?

HOW--PUT SOME LIFE INTO IT!

Simone: OK.

UM, AHEM. SO MUCH       
        FOR FINE THOUGHTS.

THAT'S WHY I'VE GIVEN UP
        FINE THOUGHTS.

NO ONE CAN LIVE UP--

DOMINIQUE.

YES, LOVE?

WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS LOOKING      
OUT AT THE AUDIENCE?

UM, WELL, I'M HERE.

AUDIENCE IS THERE.

THEY KNOW I'M HERE.

I KNOW THEY'RE THERE.

BE RUDE NOT TO          
        ACKNOWLEDGE THEM.

THE CLASSICAL   
                TRAINING

HE HAD          
                IN ENGLAND.

WILL YOU STOP THAT AT ONCE?

SIMONE CROSSES  
                RIGHT TO LEFT.

LEFT TO RIGHT.

SORRY?

LEFT TO RIGHT.                  
YOU CROSS LEFT TO RIGHT.

NO, I CAN'T CROSS   
            LEFT TO RIGHT.

YOU CAN'T CROSS                 
LEFT TO RIGHT?

NOT EMOTIONALLY, NO.

I MEAN, I CAN CROSS     
        FROM THE RIGHT TO LEFT,

RIGHT TO LEFT,

AND RIGHT TO LEFT.

A RIGHT ANGLE           
        IS POSSIBLE.

BUT LEFT TO RIGHT?      
        I...

IT'S JUST NOT...

IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE  
        EMOTIONALLY.

I...

LOOK,                   
        I'M TRYING MY BEST.

DO YOU WANT ME          
        TO CONTINUE OR NOT?

DO YOU KNOW WHAT    
            THIS SCENE IS ABOUT?

YEAH, I KNOW WHAT               
THE SCENE IS ABOUT.

A YOUNG WOMAN LIKE YOU  
        FALLS IN LOVE

WITH A MAN WHO'S TAKEN.

THE SIGHT OF HIM

MAKES HER BREASTS       
        TREMBLE.

SHE THINKS,         
            "WHERE IS HE?

"WHAT IS HE DOING?

"WHAT IS HE         
            THINKING?

IS HE THINKING      
            ABOUT ME?"

"WHAT IS HE GOING       
        TO THINK OF MY DRESS?"

"IS HE GOING TO LIKE    
        THE WAY I SMELL?"

SHE IMAGINES HE WILL    
        RUN AWAY WITH HER,

LEAVING BEHIND          
        EVERYTHING HE ONCE KNEW.

AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

HE DOESN'T GO.

SHE'S LEFT ALONE.

ALONE.

I WAS MOVING THERE              
EMOTIONALLY.

YOU DON'T MOVE THERE.

YOU ARE THERE.

I'VE SEEN THE WAY   
            YOU LOOK AT TUCCIO.

I DON'T LOOK AT HIM.

YOU DO LOOK AT HIM.

YOU SEE YOURSELF SAILING
        ACROSS THE SEA WITH HIM.

THAT'S NOT TRUE.

WHISPERING IN HIS EAR,  
        HIS MUSE.

Dominique:                  
    YOU SUBTLE WHORE.

THAT'S WHY YOU POLLUTED     
    MY LOVE, IS IT?

FOR HIM?

Dominique:  
                    OH.

YES, YES, YOU IMAGINE   
        YOURSELF RUNNING AWAY--

I DON'T WANT                
    TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM!

THAT'S NOT TRUE.

YOU CAN LEAN AGAINST            
HIS DOOR FOREVER,

BUT HE'LL NEVER GO.

I DON'T CARE.

HE MAY HAVE YOU,                
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT YOU.

I DON'T CARE!       
            YES, HE WILL!

HE WON'T.

HE WILL!                
        YES, HE WILL!

NO, HE WON'T.

HE WILL.

I DON'T KNOW            
        WHAT I'M SAYING.

THAT'S IT, THAT'S THE SCENE.    
NOW SAY THE WORDS.

I CAN'T SAY THE WORDS.

SHE'S NOT GONNA KEEP CRYING     
DURING MY SPEECH, IS SHE?

Rachel:                         
SAY THE WORDS.

SO MUCH FOR FINE THOUGHTS.

THAT'S WHY I'VE GIVEN UP        
FINE THOUGHTS.

NO ONE CAN LIVE UP TO THEM.

NO ONE.

I WANT THOUGHTS                 
THAT I CAN LIVE UP TO.

I WANT THOUGHTS               
  THAT ARE WHO I AM.

NOT SOMEONE                     
I CAN'T EVER HOPE TO BE.

WE CANCELED ALL PLANS 
          FOR<i>  ILLUMINATA.</i>

WE DO<i>  A DOLL'S HOUSE.</i>

IBSEN?

IBSEN HAS GREAT APPEAL      
    AMONG THE THINKING CLASSES.

I HATE THAT                     
NORTHERN STUFF!

<i>  YOU</i>  HAVE TO TELL HER.

WHAT AM I           
            SUPPOSED TO SAY?

"THROW TUCCIO'S SCRIPT  
        IN THE GARBAGE"?

YOU'RE A WOMAN.

IT'D BE MUCH LESS       
        PAINFUL COMING FROM YOU.

IF THE NEWS IS UNPLEASANT,  
    YOU'RE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

YOU THINK I'M AFRAID OF THEM?   
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

I DO HAVE A CERTAIN SENSITIVITY 
TOWARDS THEIR FEELINGS.

FOR YOU TO FACE REALITY,

IT'S AS IF YOU'RE       
        HAVING A STROKE.

WHERE ARE YOUR BALLS?

GOD DAMN IT!

I CAN TAKE A RELATIONSHIP       
WITHOUT LOVE,

WITHOUT SEX, EVEN,              
BUT DON'T YOU DARE

UNDERMINE MY COURAGE            
BY IMPUGNING MY MASCULINITY!

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

WHATEVER IT IS,     
            ASK MY WIFE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.    
        I WILL.

I'M A SERVANT           
        OF YOUR WORDS.

WITHOUT THEM,

I AM THE MERE TUB OF    
        FAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU,

INCAPABLE OF SPEECH.

EXCUSE ME.

YOU WERE VERY...

EXCELLENT           
            IN THE REHEARSAL.

HERE.

OHH!

DON'T LET THAT WHORE            
GET YOU DOWN.

IF IT WAS MY WIFE,              
I'D GIVE HER ONE OF THOSE.

WHERE'S THE ELECTRICITY?

I KNOW.                         
WHAT CAN I DO?

MY WIFE IS A SKINFLINT.

Marco:                      
    â™ªâ™ª MY LOVE, SHE'S LIKE â™ªâ™ª

MORNING TO YOU, FLAVIO.

MORNING, PAPA.

GOOD MORNING.

[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS]

IT'S THE POLICE.

IT'S THE POLICE!

WHERE'S THIS        
            OLD ACTOR FLAVIO?

WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HIM?

I THOUGHT                   
    YOU'D COME FOR ME.

WHAT DID HE DO?

BY ORDER OF         
            OUR GREAT MAYOR,

OLD FLAVIO          
            IS UNDER ARREST

FOR ASSAULT         
            WITH INTENT TO KILL.

OH, MY GOD.             
        WHAT HAVE I DONE?

WHO DID HE TRY TO KILL?

EXCUSE ME, MADAM,       
        BUT...

IT WAS PUPO.

WHICH PUPO?                     
NOT THE MAYOR'S NEPHEW?

YES, THAT PUPO.

HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I       
    THROWN THAT LITTLE THIEF

OUT OF MY THEATER?

OLD FLAVIO PERFORMS             
IN THE ENTIRE REPERTORY

OF THIS COMPANY.                
HE'S IRREPLACEABLE.

YOU'RE TOO KIND.

Orlandini: IF YOU           
    CAN GIVE US AN HOUR.

I'LL SPEAK                      
TO THE MAGISTRATE.

HE'S THE MAYOR'S NEPHEW.
        MY HANDS ARE TIED.

CLICHÃ©S,                        
NOTHING BUT CLICHÃ©S.

I WON'T HAVE THEM               
IN MY THEATER.

WHAT CAN I DO?

WHAT CAN YOU DO?

YOU CAN STOP SUCKING            
YOUR MOTHER'S TIT.

I WANT TO HAVE          
        THAT WOMAN'S CHILD.

THERE'S NOTHING WRONG           
WITH YOUR MOTHER'S TIT.

I'D SUCK IT.

CAPTAIN, OUR DINNER     
        IS NOW CANCELED.

BUT, SIMONE--

I MUST TELL YOU ALL,    
        I AM HER LOVER.

HE'S UNDER ARREST!

NO, LET'S TALK.                 
WE CAN TALK.

THERE'S NO NEED FOR A TRIAL.

TRIAL?

WILL IT BE DRAMATIC?        
    WILL THERE BE A CROWD?

IF YOU WANT TO KNOW             
WHO IT WAS,

IT WAS ME!                    
  I STRUCK PUPO!

HE WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,          
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW!

PUPO WAS ALMOST BLINDED!

PUPO!

I CAUGHT THAT PUPO      
        STEALING THIS MAN'S HAT.

AND SO I CHOKED HIM,            
AND I'D DO IT AGAIN.

AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

I'D CHOKE YOU, TOO,             
IF YOU TOUCHED MY HAT!

NO, NO!

THIS THING OF DARKNESS  
        I ACKNOWLEDGE MINE.

HE DOESN'T KNOW                 
WHAT HE'S SAYING.

DID YOU SEE MY<i>  TEMPE?</i>

NOT MANY PEOPLE DID.

Rachel:                         
PAPA, PAPA.

[IMITATING WIND]

HA HA HA HA!

BE NOT AFEARED.

Pallenchio:                     
BE NOT AFEARED.

THE ISLE.

THE ISLE                        
IS FULL OF NOISES.

SOUNDS.

SOUNDS AND SWEET AIRS           
THAT GIVE DELIGHT.

GIVE DELIGHT,       
            HURT NOT.

SOMETIMES A THOUSAND            
TWANGLING INSTRUMENTS

WILL HUM ABOUT MINE EARS,       
AND SOMETIMES VOICES,

THAT, IF I THEN HAD WAKE        
AFTER LONG SLEEP,

WILL MAKE ME SLEEP AGAIN.

AND THEN, IN DREAMING,

THE CLOUDS METHOUGHT            
WOULD OPEN AND SHOW

RICHES READY                    
TO DROP UPON ME,

THAT WHEN I WAKED,

I CRIED TO DREAM AGAIN.


SHH!

[APPLAUSE STOPS]

Flavio:                         
YES, SIR.

I AM JUST A MERE SHADOW.

FOR MY CHARACTER TO EXIST,

MY HAT--

A HAT I SEARCHED FOR            
TO DRESS MY CHARACTER

IN THE MOST                     
PRECISE FASHION--

WAS A NECESSITY.

WITHOUT THAT...

I COULD NOT PERFORM             
MY TASK--

MY TASK,                        
WHICH IS THE ESSENCE

OF MY LIVELIHOOD.

WELL...

THE GREAT SHIP SAILS.

TAKE ME TO MY ACCUSER...

THIS PUPO.

[DOOR OPENS]

[DOOR CLOSES]

WELL, IT APPEARS THINGS         
ARE NOT GOING VERY WELL,

SO MY WIFE AND I...

MY WIFE HAS DECIDED           
  YOU WILL DO<i>  A DOLL'S HOUSE.</i>

IBSEN?                      
                    IBSEN?

YES, IBSEN.                     
HE HAS GREAT APPEAL

AMONG THE THINKING CLASS.

THE THINKING CLASS?

WHO'S HEARD OF THEM?

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

WHAT ABOUT          
            TUCCIO'S PLAY?

IT'S NOT FINISHED.

MY PLAY?                
    IN WHOSE OPINION?

IN UMBERTO BEVALAQUA'S.

THAT SODOMITE.

AND EVERY OTHER CRITIC.

I HATE TO REMIND YOU,           
BUT YOU ARE UNDER CONTRACT.

I TOLD YOU NOT TO SIGN IT.

AND HOW ARE WE TO EAT?

YOU AND YOUR EATING.

WHAT ABOUT MY PLAY?

YOUR PLAY?

IF YOUR CONCERN'S       
        ALL WITH YOUR PLAY

AND NONE WITH ME,

PALLENCHIO CAN ANSWER   
        YOUR DEMANDS.

UH, THE STAR'S              
    DEFINITELY MOVING

TO THE NORTH,               
    THOUGH, ISN'T IT?

HMM? WITH IBSEN...

THE OTHER ONE.

IS THERE LOVE IN THIS 
        <i>  DOLL'S HOUSE?</i>

Orlandini:                  
    NO ONE WILL SEE IT.

EVERYONE IS SEEING IT.          
HE'S THE RAGE.

YOU'D DO THIS<i>  DOLL'S HOUSE?</i>

Rachel: NOW'S           
        NOT THE TIME, TUCCIO.

FOR ME, IT IS.

MY TIME--IT'S NOT YOUR PLAY.    
IT'S MY PLAY.

OH, GOD,            
            THIS SELFISHNESS--

"MY PLAY. MY PLAY." 
            I CAN'T STAND IT.

MAYBE THIS IBSEN                
IS MORE TO YOUR LIKING.

YES.        
                    MAYBE HE IS.

GOOD.               MAYBE       
THEN DO HIM.        I WILL.

DON'T SAY MAYBE.

GO AHEAD.               
        DO HIM.

GO TO PALLENCHIO      
          RIGHT NOW.

TELL HIM,               
        "I, THE GREAT RACHEL,

"LOVER TO               
        THE MEDIOCRITY TUCCIO,

"AM HERE TO EAT.

"GIVE ME IBSEN          
        AND SOME SAUSAGE.

I AM READY."

I AM SURE, AS ALWAYS,

YOU'LL TRANSFORM        
        THE MOMENT

INTO SOMETHING...

INCANDESCENT.

Dominique:                      
TUCCIO--

IT'S HER LIFE.

LET HER LIVE IT 
                AS SHE SEES FIT.

TUCCIO, TO DO                   
THIS IBSEN PLAY

DOESN'T MEAN                    
SHE'S FINISHED WITH YOU.

ARE YOU SPEAKING
                FOR RACHEL

OR FOR YOURSELF,
                DOMINIQUE?

HOW AM I TO TAKE THAT?

WELL, TAKE IT       
            ANY WAY YOU CHOOSE.

AND WHAT IF I CHOOSE            
TO RESENT IT?

WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS          
    A LONG TIME, TUCCIO.

FRIENDSHIP              
        MUST BE TESTED

EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO HER,

IF YOU DON'T MIND           
    MY SAYING SO.

I, TO HER?

DO YOU EXPECT ME                
TO REFUSE THIS IBSEN PLAY?

I EXPECT NOTHING.

OUR LIVES           
            WIND THEMSELVES OUT.

WHEN THEY WIND TOGETHER,
        THAT IS SOMETHING FINE

AND RARE.

WHEN THEY UNRAVEL,      
        I'LL LEAVE IT TO OTHERS

TO DIAGNOSE THE CAUSE.

I'LL SEND A LETTER          
    TO THE MAGISTRATE

ON YOUR FATHER'S BEHALF.

WE'LL DO ALL WE CAN,

BUT I BEG YOU, RACHEL,

DON'T MIX               
    YOUR LOVE AND YOUR ART.

YOU DO VIOLENCE             
    TO YOUR NATURE, YOUR TALENT.

I NEED SOMETHING NEW.

TUCCIO'S PLAY--

TUCCIO'S PLAY?

BELONGS TO MY TIME.

HAS NO ENDING.

IT IS IN THE AIR
                THAT I BREATHE.

DO<i>  CAMILLE.</i>

THE PEOPLE                    
  LOVE YOU IN<i>  CAMILLE.</i>

JUST BECAUSE            
        YOU LOVE HIM

DOESN'T MAKE HIM            
    A GREAT DRAMATIST.

DO YOU THINK            
    YOU'RE THE ONLY WOMAN

THAT'S EVER             
    BEEN FOOLED BY A MAN?

CELIMENE DRAGGED HER LOVER  
        AROUND FOR YEARS

FOISTING HIM            
        UPON AUDIENCES.

HE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

HE WAS A DONKEY.

YOU COMPARE TUCCIO  
            TO CELIMENE'S WHORE?

OH, HE WAS A WHORE.             
SHE'S RIGHT.

BUT WHAT A WHORE.

QUIET.              
        THE POINT IS...

THAT THE TEST           
        OF AN ARTIST

IS IF HE CAN STAND          
        ON HIS OWN.

WOULD TUCCIO            
    BE DONE WITHOUT YOU?

NO, NEVER.                      
LISTEN...

IN TUCCIO'S PLAY,               
THE HUSBAND BETRAYS THE WIFE,

AND WHAT DOES SHE DO?

SHE DOESN'T TAKE REVENGE.       
SHE DOESN'T KILL HIM.

SHE DOESN'T EVEN LEAVE HIM.

SHE GOES ON LOVING HIM.

THAT'S HIS ENDING.

IT'S RIDICULOUS.

DID YOU EVER SEE              
  THE END OF<i>  ANTONY?</i>

DO YOU KNOW                   
  HOW<i>  ANTONY</i>  ENDS?

THE ENDING OF<i>  ANTONY?</i>

ANTONY'S MISTRESS HEARS         
HER HUSBAND'S FOOTSTEPS.

THE HUSBAND HAS RETURNED        
UNEXPECTEDLY,

SO, ANTONY,                     
OF COURSE, SUGGESTS

THAT HE AND THE LADY            
SHOULD CLEAR OUT.

"OH, NO," SHE SAYS,

"I MUST KEEP                    
MY REPUTATION."

SO, WITH THE HUSBAND            
COMING UP THE STAIRS,

ANTONY STABS HER                
THROUGH THE HEART,

FLINGS OPEN THE DOOR,           
AND SAYS,

"I KILLED HER                   
WITH THIS DAGGER.

SHE RESISTED ME."

WHAT A CURIOUS WAY  
            TO PRESERVE

A LADY'S REPUTATION.

YOU THINK SO? WELL,             
THE AUDIENCE WENT WILD--

ESPECIALLY                      
IN THE CHEAPER SEATS.

BUT NOT JUST HERE               
IN AMERICA--ALL OVER.

ALL THE GREAT ENDINGS.

OEDIPUS HAS SEX                 
WITH HIS MOTHER,

AND, WHAT?                      
HE SAYS, "I'M SORRY"?

HE TEARS HIS EYES OUT.

OTHELLO THINKS                  
HIS WIFE AND CASSIO--

HE THINKS,

AND HE KILLS HER                
AND HIMSELF.

<i>  HAMLET--</i>

EVERYBODY DIES.

<i>  PHAEDRA.</i>                      
  THESE ARE PLAYS.

SO WHY DON'T YOU DO 
            THESE PLAYS?

WHY? BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS       
TO SEE THEM, THAT'S WHY.

BUT THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY      
FROM THEIR ENDINGS.

WHENEVER I HAVE TO DO   
        A DEATH SCENE,

I THINK ONE DAY         
        I WILL REALLY DIE...

AND ON THAT DAY,        
        I'LL REMEMBER

I ONCE ACTED A PARODY

OF MY OWN DYING MOMENTS.

WHEN THE SOUL   
                REMEMBERS...

WHAT WILL IT SAY?

"I GO IN THE WIND..."

"LIKE SOMEONE           
    WHO KNOWS HIS WAY...

"THOUGH IN MY HEART,        
    I AM ONLY OBEYING

"A VOICE THAT           
    CARRIES ME FORWARD--

ALWAYS FORWARD."

"WHAT WILL I FIND       
    AT THE END OF SUCH A LIFE?"

"PERHAPS..."

"THE SECRET SWEETNESS       
    OF HAVING OBEYED MY FATE?"

"PERHAPS."

THAT IS TUCCIO'S WRITING.

IT SPEAKS TO ME.

I WILL DO         
        <i>  A DOLL'S HOUSE,</i>

BUT ONLY IF TUCCIO'S PLAY

IS GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE.


[READS ALOUD]


WHERE IS MY CHILD?          
        MY CHILD.

WHERE IS THE CHILD?

OH, MY CHILD,

OH, WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?


YOU SLUT.                       
                    WHAT?

SO THAT'S HOW YOU GET           
YOUR GOOD REVIEWS.

WHAT?

LOOK. LOOK AT THIS.             
LOOK.

HEH HEH HEH!

OH, UH, UH,                     
UH, UH, UH.

OH, MY GOD.

I--I--

YOU GO.

YOU HAVE NO CHOICE  
            BUT TO GO.

BUT HE'LL PORK ME.

THEN LET HIM AND        
        ACT LIKE YOU LIKE IT.

NO.                         
            YES!

I AM NOT. NO!

YOU GO FOR US!  
    NO. NO.

FOR THE COMPANY!                
FOR TUCCIO!

YOU'RE GOING TO GO!

I AM NOT        YOU ARE GOING   
GOING TO GO!    TO GO!

YES!        
NO, I'M NOT!

YES, YOU ARE!

OW!

I--

WHY DON'T YOU GO?

I WOULD, BUT                    
HE DOESN'T WANT ME.

I COME ACROSS                   
AS TOO MASCULINE.

THINK OF MY MOTHER. 
            WHAT WOULD SHE SAY?

KEEP YOUR MOTHER                
OUT OF THIS FOR ONCE.

JUST GIVE HIM HOPE.

LOOK...

TELL HIM YOU TOOK               
A VOW OF CHASTITY--

ANYTHING--

BUT LEAD HIM ON.

LEAD HIM ON.

LEAD HIM ON.

YOU CAN DO IT.

IT'S EASY.                      
JUST LET YOURSELF GO.

EASY, EASY.         
            YEAH, EASY FOR YOU.

YOU'RE GOING TO GO!           
  YOU'RE GOING, I TELL YOU!

YOU'RE GOING    I'M NOT GOING   
TO DO IT!       TO DO IT!

ENOUGH!             
        ENOUGH, I SAY!

YOU ARE ACCUSED

OF VIOLATING            
    YOUR OATH OF CELIBACY.

I AM A VIRGIN.

NONE OF         
                YOUR INSOLENCE.

STATE YOUR AGE.

19.


[NUNS SCREAMING]

UHH...

I'M HERE--

WE KNOW.

WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

WELCOME TO OUR WORLD.


Man: BRAVA! BRAVA!

Man: BRAVA!

Man:                    
    BRAVA! BRAVA! BRAVA!

BRAVA! BRAVA! BRAVA!

ALWAYS WEAR     
                FINE UNDERWEAR.

LEARN THAT.

I LEARNED IT    
                TOO LATE.

ENTER.

[BIRD CHIRPING]

COME IN, COME IN.

DON'T BE SHY.

FEEL FREE TO LOOK   
            THROUGH HER THINGS.

I DO.

Celimene: THE PLAY IS CALLED  
    <i>  THE VIRGIN OF AVILA,</i>

NOT<i>  THE CHILD</i>        
    <i>  OF THE VIRGIN OF AVILA.</i>

I HAVE TO GO.

SHE DOESN'T         
            WANT ME NEAR YOU.

I WANT MY MOON.

THE STAGE DIRECTIONS READ,

"THE VIRGIN ADVANCES,

"PALE IN THE MOONLIGHT,

CONVULSED WITH EMOTION."

I AM PALE.

I AM CONVULSED.

I WANT MY MOON!

Man: YES, MA'AM.



I HAVEN'T ACTED             
    SO WELL IN YEARS.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?    
        GET OUT. GET OUT.

I DON'T WANT TO SEE         
    YOUR FACE. GET OUT.


A RENDEZVOUS.

HOW DELIGHTFUL.

I'M SO GLAD                     
THAT YOU COULD COME.

PLEASE.

DO ME A FAVOR.

WHAT?

WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

TONIGHT'S NOT THE NIGHT         
TO THINK OF YOURSELF.

WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW?

WELL, WHEN WE GET THERE,        
WE'LL SEE.

HERE'S WHAT                     
I WANT YOU TO DO.


I SMELL SEX.

DO YOU THINK                    
MASTURBATION IS A SIN?

DEPENDS WHERE       
            YOUR OTHER HAND IS.

ASTERGOURD.

ASTERGOURD.

ASTERGOURD!

ASTERGOURD.

IS THAT YOU,    
                MY LARGENESS,

MY BIGNESS?

ASTERGOURD.

ASTERGOURD.

[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

OH.

WHAT HAS HAPPENED               
TO YOU?

YOU HAVE BECOME                 
SO HANDSOME.

I MEAN, YOU WERE NOT            
THIS GOOD-LOOKING YESTERDAY.

OH, GOD.

IS THE CHICKEN GOOD?

CAN I HAVE                      
A LITTLE CHICKEN?

I'M KIND OF                     
A BONE PERSON.

I LIKE TO SUCK THE BONE.

IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT       
    YOU SAW OUR PLAY UNFINISHED.

WE, UH...

OUR COMPANY HAVE BEEN   
        WORKING AT IT, AND...

IT WOULD BE...

ENCOURAGING

IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER   
        COMING TO SEE IT AGAIN.

PLEASE, DON'T BE AFRAID.

EXPRESS YOURSELF.

I SEE GREATNESS IN YOU.

YOU'RE ONE STEP FROM IT.

MAYBE I'M BETTER OFF
            AT THIS LEVEL.

NO.

NO ONE WANTS TO BE MEDIOCRE.


DO YOU--DO YOU THINK
            I'M MEDIOCRE?

I THINK...

YOU ARE PLUMP OF PALM.

WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

I'M NOT AFRAID.

YOU ARE.

YOU'RE HIDING...

FROM YOURSELF,

FROM THE WORLD.

DON'T BE AFRAID.

BE FEARLESS, HUH?

BE BRAVE.

LOVE ME.

LOVE ME!

YOU'RE EVERYTHING I WANT.

PLEASE GET UP.          
        MR. BEVALAQUA, PLEASE.

YOU'RE EVERYTHING       GET UP, 
I WANT.                 PLEASE.

DON'T LEAVE ME.                 
LOVE ME, MARCO.

DON'T GO!

AH!

OOH!

AH!

IF YOU          MR. BEVALAQUA-- 
LEAVE...

IN FRONT OF YOU                 
RIGHT NOW,

I KILL MYSELF.

NO! NO, NO.

YES! MARCO...

DON'T GO.

MARCO--

PUT THE GUN     NO?             
DOWN!           I KILL MYSELF.

YES! AAH!

AAH! AAH!               PLEASE. 
                        PLEASE.

AAH!

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,       
  PLEASE, PLEASE.

MARCO...

YOU SEE?

YOU CARE.

YOU DO CARE.

Celimene: DO YOU LIKE   
        THE WAY I LOOK?

NO?

YES?


VERY WELL. I SHALL  
            NEVER ASK YOU AGAIN.

YOU SEE?

I HAVE LEARNED          
        HOW TO LISTEN.

YOU KNOW HOW YOU LOOK.

I'M AN AGING ACTRESS.

THAT'S WHAT             
        THE CRITICS SAY.

THEY NEVER UNDERSTOOD ME,   
    AND THEY NEVER SHALL.

I MUST AGAIN            
        REINVENT MYSELF.

IT'S DIFFICULT                  
TO WIN CELEBRITY TWICE.

YOU AND I ARE GOING     
        TO GET ALONG VERY WELL.

YOU MUST LIE TO ME,             
YOU UNDERSTAND.

I'M NOT A FOOL. I DON'T EXPECT  
YOU TO PROMISE ME ANYTHING,

BUT...

THERE IS SOMETHING              
BETWEEN US.

YES, THERE IS.

OH, I'M GLAD.                   
I WAS WORRIED.

I THOUGHT I'D       
            OVERESTIMATED YOU.

I'VE GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING--

MY LOVE,

MY YOUTH...

MY STRENGTH...

MY LIFE.

ALL OF ME.

I'VE GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING.

Man:                
            EXCUSE ME, SIR.

IS THIS YOURS, SIR?

WHAT?

IS THIS YOURS, SIR?

WHAT?

DID YOU DROP THIS?

DON'T MOVE.

I'LL KILL YOU.      
            I'LL KILL YOU.

EVERYTHING I FIND,  
            I KEEP.

WHAT DO YOU THINK               
YOU'RE DOING?

HE'S GOING  
                    TO KILL HIM.

IT'S NOT YOUR JOB               
TO BE COURAGEOUS...

Man: DON'T MOVE.

BUT TO PORTRAY IT.

GET OUT OF HERE     
            BEFORE I KILL YOU!

IT'S AN EGGCUP.

MMM.

IT'S NOT VERY CLEAN     
        IN HERE.

IF THIS PLACE HAD       
        TO BE DUSTED EVERY DAY,

THERE'D BE NO END TO IT.


DON'T WORRY ABOUT               
YOUR EGGCUPS.

Bevalaqua:          
            LOOK AT THOSE LEGS.

IF I WANTED,

I COULD OVERPOWER YOU.

ONCE, IN A SCISSOR LOCK,

I HELD A MAN

AN ENTIRE WEEKEND.

WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?

YOU SEE, YOUR REACTION  
        IS TO PRETEND

YOU DON'T KNOW        
          WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

WHY ARE YOU             
        NOT WITH WOMAN?

I DON'T KNOW.

I LIKE...

SAY IT.

LOOK, I'VE TAKEN                
A VOW OF CHASTITY.

SAY IT.

SAY WHAT?

PUCKERED ROSEBUD.

WHAT?

I AM A PUCKERED ROSEBUD.

SAY IT.

NO, I AM NOT.

YOU ARE...

SUCH A PUCKERED ROSEBUD.

I AM NOT IN ANY WAY.

YOU ARE...

YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE.

I CAN CHANGE.


I CAN CHANGE.

I WILL CHANGE.

[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING        
        ON PHONOGRAPH]

A WOMAN             
            IS SO CHANGEABLE

WHEN SHE'S IN LOVE.


AHH...

OOH!

DANCE FOR ME, SALOME.

Celimene:                       
TALK TO ME OF RACHEL.

TELL ME SOMETHING

SHE DOESN'T WANT TOLD           
TO ANYONE.

PERHAPS YOU STILL LOVE HER.

I HAVE SEEN

LOVE MAKE PEOPLE QUIET.

THEY THINK

SILENCE

PRESERVES

INTIMACY.

AND ALL YOU ASK         
        IS THAT I BETRAY RACHEL?

YOU BETRAYED HER                
BY COMING HERE.

Beppo: PLEASURE                 
IS NOT ONLY HAPPINESS.

IT'S ANGUISH.

IT'S CHAOS.

A REAL CLOWN KNOWS THIS.

YOU FACE DEATH ALONE.

YOU DON'T NEED                  
ANYTHING UP THERE

TO HELP YOU.

CLOWNS...

LAUGH AT DEATH.

Bevalaqua: I'VE ALWAYS  
        BEEN DIFFERENT.

MY HAIR GROWS DIRECTLY  
        OUT OF MY BRAIN.

PEOPLE LOOK AT ME   
            WITH THEIR FACES.

THEY WHISPER,

"MACARONI QUEEN."

"INVERT."

I DON'T CARE.

THEY SAY I LIKE NOTHING.

THAT'S NOT TRUE.

I LIKE CHOCOLATE.

I LIKE CARAVAGGIO,

REVENGE,

WAITING FOR PEOPLE,

HOPING THEY DON'T COME.

EVEN IF IT IS...

A BEAUTIFUL MAN.

I LOVE THE CIRCUS, HUH?

YOU, TOO?

YEAH. I KNEW THIS.

THE SKY AT DAWN,

LONG, ENDLESS LEGS,

THE SEA IN WINTER...

PEOPLE WHO SPEAK
                VERY LITTLE,

EMPTY PLACES,

GARLIC, HUH?

ALL OF ITALY,

VIENNA--THOUGH          
        I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE--

KNACKWURST,

SECRETS...

THE DAWN,

NIGHT, AND YOU, 
                MY RARE FRUIT.

I ADORE YOU.

YOU...

ASTONISH ME.

WHEN FIRST I SAW YOU,

I FELT LOVE COME TO ME

LIKE THE DEEP THRUST        
    OF A LANCE IN MY THROAT.

DO YOU THINK I'M HEAVY?

YOU'RE A FAT BASTARD,

AND THAT'S WHY          
        I LIKE YOU.

TRUE FREEDOM

IS TO HAVE NO VANITY.

HA HA!

[BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN]

<i>  VOLARE! VOLARE!</i>

AAH!

YAAH!

YAAH!

I WISH MY FRIENDS   
            WERE HERE.

THESE OUGHT     
                TO BE SHARED.

DID YOU EVER MILK A COW?

OH, MOMMY, MOMMY, MOMMY,    
    MOMMY, MOMMY, MOMMY, MOMMY.

CAN I CALL YOU MOMMY?

YOUR NEXT PLAY--        
        YES, I KNOW ABOUT IT,

AND I WANT IT.

OH!     WE CAN SIGN THE PAPERS  
        HERE TONIGHT...

IN 5 MINUTES,           
        AND IN 3 MONTHS,

WE COULD OPEN IN PARIS,

UHH.

            WHEREVER YOU WANT.

JAPAN.

AHH.

AHH.

AHH...

PAPA.

AH.

OH.

YES.

I TAUGHT YOU TO READ,

AND LIFE WAS            
        YOUR ONLY SCHOOL.

DON'T YOU WORRY.

TOMORROW, I WILL TALK   
        TO PONTIUS PILATE

WITH MORE LUCK          
        THAN THE OTHER.

I HOPE SO.

AHH. YOU GO, HMM?

REST.

DO YOUR WORK.

ALLOW ME TO DO MINE.

YOU GO TO TUCCIO.

HE NEEDS YOU NOW, HMM?

WHAT IS YOUR HURRY?

WHAT HAS HAPPENED   
            IS BUT THE PROLOGUE.

LOOK.

LOOK AT ME.

THAT...

IS YOURS.

OH, NO.

OH, YES.

I NEED MEANING  
                IN MY LIFE.

GIVE ME MEANING.

THIS MOMENT--

IT WILL NEVER RETURN.


WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

BACK TO HER?

WHAT, TO HOLD       
            EACH OTHER'S HANDS?

TRY TO BEHAVE           
        LIKE A GENTLEMAN,

SINCE NOTHING COULD     
        EVER CONVINCE YOU

TO BEHAVE LIKE A LADY.

YOU BEAST!

AAH!

YOU LIKE THAT, HUH?

I WEEP. I WEEP,                 
THAT'S ALL,

AND WEEPING MAKES ME UGLY.

THE PERFORMANCE OVER?

NO.

NO. I NEVER                     
STOP ACTING.

I HAVE ALWAYS ACTED--

ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE.

I AM MY OWN DOUBLE.

I ACT IN THE MORNING            
WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

I ACT IN RESTAURANTS          
  WHEN I ASK FOR MORE BREAD.

I ACT WHEN I TELL MY MOTHER     
THAT I LOVE HER.

I LOVE--I ADORE                 
MY PROFESSION.

I SERVE IT CONSTANTLY.

IT IS MY ONLY FRIEND.

I'M GOING.

NO! NO.

IT'S A SLENDER CURTAIN          
BETWEEN THEATER AND LIFE.

IN THE NAME         
            OF ALL THAT'S REAL,

I'M GOING.

NO! NO! NO!

OH, YES, CARESS ME.

OH, I LOVE IT     
              WHEN YOU CARESS M.

OHH.

PLEASE!

THIS IS WHAT                    
I'VE ALWAYS WISHED...

NOTHING ON YOUR MIND            
BUT PIERO, PIERO, PIERO.

MY ONLY WISH...

THE WISH OF                     
A SMALL-PART PLAYER

WHO LONGS TO PLAY THE LEAD      
FOR ONCE IN HIS LIFE.

PLAY WITH ME, MY LOVE...

THE WORDS I WAS NEVER ABLE      
TO HEAR YOU SAY.

I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE    
    SOME BREAKFAST, MY DARLING.

HOW THOUGHTFUL.

SOME TEA.

WHY, YES.

THANK YOU.

YOU LOOK PARTICULARLY   
        ALIVE THIS MORNING.

THANK YOU.                      
SO DO YOU.

I FEEL ALIVE.

I FEEL GLAD         
            TO BE ALIVE.

SO AM I.

SOME MELON PERHAPS?

PLEASE.


WE LIVE IN A DRAMA...

MY BUTTERCUP.

AND THAT IS OUR TRIUMPH.

THE TRIUMPH

DANCE WITH ME, SALOME.      
    DANCE WITH ME, SALOME.

OH, MY!

WHAT?!

STOP! STOP, BEPPO!


IT'S BEEN A ROUGH   
            NIGHT ALL AROUND.

[HORSE WHINNIES,
                DOG BARKING]

HEY.

WHAT DO YOU THINK   
            YOU'RE DOING...

IN THE MIDDLE       
            OF THE NIGHT?


Beppo: WHERE HAS HE BEEN,   
        THAT WHOREMONGER?

[RACHEL HUMMING]

[KNOCK KNOCK]

COME IN.

WHAT NEWS?

GOOD NEWS.

<i>  ILLUMINATA'S</i>                  
  NOT CANCELED.

SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED          
SOMEWHERE,

THOUGH I REMAIN,                
AS ALWAYS, IN THE DARK.

WE'RE DOING     
                TUCCIO'S PLAY?

YES, IT'S BEEN DECIDED.

TONIGHT THE CRITICS             
ARE RETURNING,

EVEN BEVALAQUA.

HOW'D YOU SLEEP,
                MY TUCCIO?

WELL ENOUGH.

MMM.

FEELS GOOD                      
TO CLEAN YOURSELF, HUH?

WELL, I'LL SEE YOU              
AT THE REHEARSAL.

WHAT REHEARSAL?

FOR YOUR PLAY.

I HAVE NO PLAY.     
            IT'S CANCELED.

NO PLAY?                        
THEN NO REHEARSAL.

BUT YOU JUST SAID   
            THAT I--

I DID HEAR SOMETHING, YES,      
BUT IT MUST BE A LIE...

LIKE MANY THINGS HERE.

HOW DID YOU SLEEP?

I SLEPT FINE.           
        DIDN'T YOU ASK ME THAT?

HE LIES                         
RIGHT TO MY EYES.

WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

THAT'S WHAT I'D                 
LIKE TO KNOW.

RACHEL STRUCK A DEAL            
WITH PALLENCHIO.

A DEAL?

I THOUGHT           
            WE WERE CLOSED.

YOU THOUGHT?                    
YOU THOUGHT!

OUR RACHEL WOULD NOT            
DO THEIR IBSEN

IF THEY REFUSED                 
THIS CHANCE TO YOU.

WE HAVE TODAY                   
TO FIX THE PLAY.

YOU PERFORM TONIGHT.

IF THEY LIKE IT, PFFT,          
WE HAVE OUR RUN.

RACHEL DID THIS?

THAT TRAITOR.

YOU MEAN HIM    
                AND CELIMENE?

TUCCIO AND CELIMENE?

HAVE YOU HEARD?

ALWAYS THE LAST 
                TO KNOW.

TUCCIO'S IN             
        WITH CELIMENE.

WHO HASN'T BEEN IN  
            WITH CELIMENE?

YOU'VE BEEN IN HER?

SHE SAW MY RIGID BONE.

I LIVE THROUGH YOU,             
DOMINIQUE.

DON'T YOU KNOW      
            WHAT THIS MEANS?

IF HE'S CAPABLE OF  
            SLEEPING WITH HER--

BUT ARE YOU SURE            
    HE'S SLEEPING WITH HER?

THEN HE'S CAPABLE OF
            TOURING WITH HER.

TOURING     
                    WITH HER?

IN WHAT?                        
NOT THIS PLAY?

NO, BUT WHAT ABOUT      
        HIS NEXT PLAY, NEW PLAY?

HIS NEW PLAY? THE ONE       
    HE'S WRITING FOR ME?

IN PARIS.

PARIS?

YES. HIS NEW PLAY IN PARIS      
WITH THAT BITCH CELIMENE!

WHAT ABOUT YOU?         
        WHAT ABOUT THE COMPANY?

WE'RE OUT.      
                THAT'S PLAIN.

HE INTENDS IT                   
FOR NONE OF US.

NONE?


NOT ME?

NOT ME?

NO. NOT YOU.

BUT...

THAT--THAT--THAT PART,      
    THAT WAS...

BUT IT WAS PERFECT          
    FOR ME, WASN'T IT?

YES.

IT HAD ALL MY...

MY GOD,                     
    IF THIS IS TRUE...

THEN THAT MAN               
    IS A TRAITOR.

[BOYS PLAYING]

PARIS, WITHOUT ME?

HMPH.

IT'S FUNNY              
    HOW I FEEL REAL NOW.

I FEEL REAL.

I FEEL FIT TO RESPOND       
        NOT AS AN ACTOR,

NO, BUT AS A MAN,       
        PUT IT SIMPLY.

YOU BASTARD!

MMM!

MAN TO MAN.

YOU SLIMY DUPLICITOUS       
        LITTLE SHIT!

HMPH. HERE!

IN--IN--IN LIFE!

YOU BASTARD!

[DOOR CLOSES]

DO I INTERRUPT?

NO, NOT AT ALL, 
                DARLING.

THIS ENDING.                    
TUCCIO'S ENDING.

YES, FROM WHERE,

"YOU LIED TO ME,    
            AND I KNOW IT"?

YES, YES,                       
"YOU LIED TO ME..."

WE'RE STILL                     
ONE STEP AWAY.

YES, I KNOW.

DO YOU THINK IT                 
TRUTHFUL?

TRUTHFUL?

WELL, I DID,        
            BUT NOW I DON'T.

SOMETHING'S MISSING.

DARLING, WHY DON'T--    
        SHALL WE TRY SOMETHING?

SHALL WE JUST REHEARSE  
        A LITTLE?

UM, LET'S TRY THIS.

HIS NEXT PLAY           
        WILL BE DONE IN PARIS.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

HIS NEXT PLAY, FOR HER, 
        IN PARIS.

WHAT? PARIS?

YES, PARIS.     
                FOR HER.

YOU SPEAK LIKE THIS             
OF TUCCIO?

WHAT IS THE LOVE OF SOMEONE 
    LIKE TUCCIO WORTH?

YOU CLAIM TO BE                 
HIS FRIEND?

YOU FORGET, DARLING,    
        I'M YOUR FRIEND, TOO.

THEN SPEAK AS A FRIEND.         
WHAT AM I TO DO?

DESERT HIM!

I CANNOT.

YOU FOOL.       
                WHY NOT?

YOU ASK WHY?                    
BECAUSE I LOVE HIM.

AGAIN.

DESERT ME.

I CANNOT.

YOU FOOL!   
                    WHY NOT?

YOU ASK WHY?                    
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

IT'S GOOD.              
        IT'S BETTER, ISN'T IT?

CAN WE GO ON?                   
                    CERTAINLY.

YOU WANT ME TO STAY IN  
        THE PLAY, OR SHALL I--

NO, NO.                     
    LET'S STAY OUTSIDE.

OH, I SHOULDN'T HAVE            
SAID ANYTHING TO YOU.

WE MUST NOT BREATHE         
    A WORD OF THIS TO RACHEL.

IT WOULD BREAK HER HEART    
    TO HEAR IT.

SHE MUST FIND OUT               
SOONER OR LATER.

WELL, THEN LET HER      
        FIND OUT LATER.

ORLANDINI, DEATH ITSELF 
        WOULD NOT SILENCE YOU.

OH, YOU LIE.                    
DEATH COULD.

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

[BOYS PLAYING]

YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE?

YOU HAVE MY WORD.

TUCCIO WILL DO                  
HIS NEXT PLAY...

IN PARIS!

WITH CELIMENE!

YOU MADE YOUR POINT             
ABOUT PARIS.

WHY DO YOU                      
GO BACK TO IT?

OH, I DON'T KNOW.       
        NO REASON, REALLY.

PERHAPS                         
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?


NO. RACHEL, NO.

I'M JUST MAKING IT UP.  
        I'M PLAYING.

I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. 
        IT'S A RIDICULOUS IDEA.

BECAUSE HE IS CAPABLE OF        
JUST SUCH INFAMOUS BEHAVIOR.

YES,                
            HE IS VERY CAPABLE.

SO PARIS                        
HAS COMMITTED?

MMM.

TUCCIO IN PARIS?

THEY'RE RAVING          
        ABOUT HIM.

HE'S THE WRITER         
        OF THE MOMENT,

AND HE SLIPPED          
        RIGHT THROUGH OUR HANDS.

YOU LIKED HIM                   
EVEN LESS THAN I.

I? HE NEEDED        
            TO BE EDITED.

WILL YOU STOP       
            SHAKING YOUR LEG?

I'M NOT SHAKING.                
YOU'RE SHAKING.

I'M NOT SHAKING.

IT WAS YOU WHO      
            DOUBTED HIS GENIUS.

MY FAITH IN HIM     
            NEVER WAVERED.

THAT'S ALL          
            HE EVER NEEDED

WAS TO BE SURROUNDED
            BY PEOPLE

WHO HAD FAITH       
            IN HIM.

FUCK PARIS.

THEY'VE BEEN WRONG BEFORE,      
YOU KNOW.

FUCK PARIS?             
        NOBODY FUCKS PARIS!

YOU FUCK PARIS, YOU OPEN
        THE DOORS TO BARBARIANS.

YOU BANISH

HUH!

HELP ME, PIERO! 
                HELP ME!

HE CAN'T. I KILLED HIM      
    WITH THIS SWORD.

OH.

VIKINGS.                        
THE VIKING HAS ARRIVED.

VIKINGS!                
                        VIKINGS!

I HATE VIKINGS.

OF COURSE, SAY NOTHING,

NOR SHOW IN ANY WAY             
THAT WE'VE HEARD A THING,

NOR BELIEVE ONE WORD OF IT.

OH, NO,                 
        WHICH DO YOU PREFER--

THAT WE HAVEN'T         
        HEARD A THING

OR WE DON'T BELIEVE     
        WHAT WE DID HEAR?

I THINK BOTH.

I CAN'T. THAT'S VERY    
        DIFFICULT FOR ME--

NOT TO BELIEVE SOMETHING
        I HAVEN'T HEARD.

YOU'RE RIGHT. THE THING         
HAS ME IN ITS GRIP ALREADY.

I THINK--               
                    FORGIVE ME.

HA.

I ASK AGAIN, FORGIVE.

IS THERE        
                SOMETHING WRONG?

NOT WITH ME.        
            WITH YOU?

NO. NOT THAT    
                I'M AWARE OF.

AWARE? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK 
    YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE?

HUH.

THINGS HAPPEN EVERY DAY     
    THAT NO ONE IS AWARE OF.

VERY TRUE, ISN'T IT?    
        IT'S TRUE, VERY TRUE.

THINGS HAPPEN ON THE OCEAN      
WHERE NO ONE IS

AND IN ANTARCTICA             
  WHERE IT'S TOO COLD TO BE.

YES, THINGS HAPPEN              
EVEN THERE,

HAVE BEEN HAPPENING THERE       
FOR YEARS,

WHICH NO ONE IS AWARE OF.

YET THEY HAPPEN,

GO ON HAPPENING,

AWARE OR NOT.

OH, MY!

OH, MY LOVE!

MY LOVE!

MY LOVE!

MARTA!

I CAN LIVE MY LIFE      
        WITHOUT YOU.

AND THERE'S             
        SOMETHING MORE.

BY ALL MEANS,       
            LET ME HEAR IT.

I CAN'T STAND YOU.

MY EUROPEAN TOUR                
WHEN I DID YOUR PLAYS?

ALL THOSE THEATERS I TOLD YOU   
WERE FULL...WERE NOT.

FOR THE FIRST TIME              
ON A TOUR OF MINE,

THEY WERE NOT FULL.

YOUR ROYALTIES--

I SENT YOU EVERY CENT           
ACCORDING TO FULL HOUSES.

I MADE UP THE DIFFERENCE        
OUT OF MY OWN POCKET.

YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.

YES,                            
THAT IS WHAT YOU SAY.

BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER            
LOVED ANYONE.

I COULDN'T BEAR YOU TO THINK    
WE WEREN'T SELLING OUT.

HOW I'VE LOVED YOU,             
AND WHAT A FOOL I'VE BEEN!

JUST GO ON! GO AWAY!            
GET OUT!

NO, NO, NO.         
            I WON'T GET OUT.

GET OUT!

I LIKE IT HERE.

YOU DON'T LIKE IT HERE.

WELL, IF YOU MEAN   
            THIS THEATER--

YES, I MEAN                     
THIS THEATER, YES.

YES, THAT'S SO.         
        I DO NOT LIKE IT HERE.

HA. AT LEAST                    
THAT'S NOT ANOTHER LIE.

SINCE WHEN IS               
    ALL I SAY A LIE?

SINCE THE DAY WE MET.

NO. THERE YOU ARE WRONG.

THE DAY WE MET,                 
EVERYTHING I SAID WAS TRUE.

I STARTED LYING ON              
THE SECOND DAY...AT DAWN.

AS IF YOU               
        REMEMBER THAT DAY

OR ANY DAY WITH ME.

WELL, SOME ARE LESS CLEAR       
THAN OTHERS,

BUT THE FIRST DAY               
WAS THE DAY...

OF OUR FIRST KISS,

AND THAT DAY...

I REMEMBER...

HOW PALE YOU WERE               
AND FLUSHED BY TURN...

AND HOW I FOUGHT TO KEEP        
SOME SPACE BETWEEN US,

FOR I DID NOT                   
WANT TO LOVE YOU

AS DEEPLY                       
AS I KNEW I WOULD.

OH, TUCCIO.

HOW CAN YOU         
            SAY SUCH THINGS

AND BE SO HORRIBLE  
            TO ME?

MY BEING HORRIBLE TO YOU,       
RACHEL, IS PART OF MY LOVE.

I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THAT.

WHERE'S TUCCIO?

THERE.

HO HO! SO, PARIS?

PARIS?

WHAT'S PARIS?

A CITY                  
        FULL OF TARTS.

WITH CELIMENE.                  
YOU'RE COMMITTED.

TARTS                       
    AND CHEAP LOVE.

CONGRATULATIONS!                
                    YEAH!

SHE'S PERFECT FOR YOU.

I KNEW IT.                      
I TOLD YOU.

THE CHEAPER THE BETTER.

AND SHE'S THE CHEAPEST.

YOUR NEXT PLAY IN PARIS?

PARIS!

YOU'RE LIKE A BITCH.            
YOU GO WHEREVER THE MONEY IS.

WITHOUT A WORD,                 
YOU BETRAY ME.

THAT'S IT. I'M NOT DOING
        YOUR PLAY TONIGHT.

YOU'RE NOT DOING                
HIS PLAY TONIGHT? WHY?

BECAUSE SHE'S NOT,  
            THAT'S WHY.

I'M NOT DOING IT.

NO, RACHEL, WAIT!

IT HAS NO ENDING!

WHAT?

SHE DOESN'T LEAVE HIM.  
        SHE DOESN'T HURT HIM.

SHE GOES ON LOVING HI!

BUT THAT'S WHAT'S               
GREAT ABOUT IT.

IT'S ONE BIG LIE!

YOU USED TO BE              
    SO DELICATE.

I USED TO THINK,

"IF I MOVE,                 
    I SHALL CRUSH HER."

DON'T.

YOU THINK THERE AREN'T      
    ANY OTHER ACTRESSES

AND COMPANIES WHO WANT      
    TO WORK WITH ME?

OF COURSE               
        THERE ARE!

HERE? OR IN PARIS,          
    FOR THAT MATTER?

OH, FUCK PARIS!                 
THEY'VE BEEN WRONG BEFORE.

YOU THINK YOU CAN           
    TEAR ME APART

THE WAY THIS ANIMAL 
            PALLENCHIO DOES?

I DID NOT!                      
NOT TO YOUR FACE! NEVER!

WHO TOLD YOU?

I HAVE A PLAY TO DELIVER    
    IN A MATTER OF HOURS.

YOU RAMBLE ON               
    ABOUT ANTARCTICA,

DOMINIQUE PLAYS             
    THE CONSPIRATOR,

AND PALLENCHIO              
    CONGRATULATES ME

FOR GOING TO A CITY         
    I'M NOT GOING TO

WITH AN ACTRESS           
      I'M NOT GOING WITH!

WHY WOULD I GO TO PARIS

AND NOT STAY HERE

WHERE I AM SO LOVED...

SO TRUSTED...

AND SO UNDERSTOOD?

IS HE STAYING                   
OR GOING?

IDIOT. HE STAYS.

RIGHT!                          

YOU HAVE WORK TO DO.

BUT PLEASE,                     
I IMPLORE YOU,

DON'T TOUCH                     
THAT ENDING!

TUCCIO.

TUCCIO.

I LOVE YOU.

WHAT?

I LOVE YOU.

YOU SAY THAT                    
AS IF YOU HAD STOPPED

AND WANTED                      
TO BEGIN AGAIN.

I NEVER STOPPED.

I DID NOTHING           
        EXCEPT TO LOVE YOU...

IMPERFECTLY.

I SPOKE FROM MY HEART,

AND IF I WAS WRONG,

I'VE BEEN WRONG BEFORE.

IT MEANS I'M            
        IMPERFECT, TUCCIO.

BORN IMPERFECT,

EDUCATED IMPERFECTLY...

MOLDED BY               
        IMPERFECT HANDS.

IF YOU'RE LOOKING       
        FOR SOMEONE

TO LOVE YOU             
        IMPERFECTLY...

LOOK NO FURTHER.

I AM SHE.

IF YOU WILL         
            STILL LOVE ME,

I AM SHE.

FORGIVE ME.

[BOYS PLAYING]

I'LL KILL YOU,      
            YOU TRAITOR!

WAIT FOR ME!

IT'S GOING WELL.

WE ARE WINNING.

YOU'RE STAYING WITH HER.

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

YOU'RE STAYING                  
WITH YOUR WIFE.

I DON'T LOVE YOU.   
            I DON'T LOVE YOU.

I DON'T LOVE YOU.

SHE BELIEVES IN ME.

THAT'S A FINE THOUGHT.

SHE BELIEVES.

I'VE GIVEN UP FINE THOUGHTS.    
NO ONE CAN LIVE UP TO THEM.

OH...

THOUGH WHEN             
        I SAY SOMETHING CLEVER,

SHE DOESN'T             
        EVEN NOTICE.

I WANT THOUGHTS                 
I CAN LIVE UP TO.

SHE CORRECTS ME.

SHE ASKS ME WHAT        
        I WANT FOR DINNER

WHEN I'M EATING         
        MY BREAKFAST.

I WANT THOUGHTS                 
THAT ARE WHO I AM,

NOT SOMEONE I CAN'T             
EVER HOPE TO BE.

MY KISSES

NO LONGER THRILL HER...

I WANT MY WORLD...

BUT THERE ARE THINGS...

THIS WORLD...

ABOUT HER...

WITH YOU AND ME IN IT.

HER SMILE...

HER LAUGH...

THE BLUSH               
        IN HER CHEEKS...

HER...

INTEGRITY,

HER HONESTY,

HER GRIEF               
        IN MY FATHER'S DEATH...

AND HER FAITH           
        IN GOODNESS.

THESE THINGS I...

I...

THERE IS                
        NO OTHER WORD...

LOVE.

I'M--I'M SORRY, BUT...

TO KNOW SOMEBODY...

AND NOT TO HATE THEM...

I'M SORRY.

I CAN'T.

I WON'T.

Simone:                 
    I GO IN THE WIND...

LIKE SOMEONE            
    WHO KNOWS THEIR WAY,

THOUGH IN MY HEART,

I'M ONLY OBEYING A VOICE    
    THAT CARRIES ME FORWARD.

WHAT WILL I FIND AT     
        THE END OF SUCH A LIFE?

PERHAPS...

THE SECRET SWEETNESS

OF KNOWING I HAVE       
        OBEYED MY FAITH.

I GO IN THE WIND,

LIKE SOMEONE            
        WHO KNOWS THEIR WAY,

THOUGH IN MY HEART,

I'M ONLY OBEYING A VOICE
        THAT CARRIES ME FORWARD,

FORWARD...

ALWAYS...

FORWARD.

FORWARD.

FORWARD.

YOU LIED TO ME,                 
AND I KNOW IT.

I CANNOT IGNORE                 
WHAT YOU'VE DONE,

BUT I MUST NOT FORGET           
YOUR FIRST KINDNESSES,

FOR EACH HOUR IN LIFE           
HAS ITS OWN WORTH.

HOW YOU MUST BE SUFFERING

THAT YOU SHOULD                 
TORTURE ME LIKE THIS.


YOU NEED ONLY SAY,  
            "PLEASE GO."

WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LOVE           
I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU,

LOVING YOU.

I WOULD LIKE SO MUCH            
FOR YOU TO LIKE ME AGAIN.

I KNOW I'VE BEEN LESS           
THAN I COULD BE.

THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I ASK    
MYSELF IF I PLEASE YOU.

I AM NOT A YOUNG GIRL...

NOR AN OLD WOMAN.

I HAVE NO DESIRE                
TO DECEIVE YOU.

IT WOULD BE EXCITING,           
BUT HOW LONG WOULD IT LAST?

WHATEVER I COULD,               
I'VE GIVEN.

LIFE HAS SHAKEN                 
MY CONFIDENCE.

EVERYTHING I HOPED TO BE

HAS NOT TURNED OUT              
ALWAYS AS I DREAMED.

EXCEPT FOR YOU.

I CANNOT THINK OF LIFE          
WITHOUT YOU.

YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

MY HUSBAND.

MY LIFE.

I HOPE YOU CAN LIVE             
WITH THIS AMOUNT OF ME.

THE SKY HAS SOMETHING   
        SO SAD ABOUT IT.

ILLUMINATA.

MY ILLUMINATA.

THERE IS SOMETHING      
        CRUEL IN EVERY LOVE.

MY HEART                
        HAS WRONGED YOU...

AND IT HAS WRONGED YOU  
        BEFORE.

IT MEANS...

I AM IMPERFECT...

BORN IMPERFECT...

EDUCATED IMPERFECTLY...

MOLDED IN               
        MY FORMATIVE YEARS

BY IMPERFECT HANDS,

AND SO...

EXPECT NAUGHT ELSE.

BUT IF YOU LOOK FOR     
        SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU...

IMPERFECTLY...

LOOK NO FURTHER.

I AM HE.

IF YOU WILL             
        STILL LOVE ME.

I AM HE.
