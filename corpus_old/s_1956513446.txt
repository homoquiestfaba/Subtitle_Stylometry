<i>Deuces wild</i>
<i>Good luck and may the best chump win</i>

Special night tonight, ain't it?

Things ain't been the same
around here without you, Harry.

<i>My bank accout ain't been as fat since</i>

Hell, I was just saying, you know,
I wonder when Harry's getting out of the joint.

<i>I'll be goddamned if he didn't walk in</i>

It must have been your tele... telepathy,
or whatever the hell you call it.

What did you do, Harry?

<i>You didn't go and kill someone did you?</i>

O<i>n nell you know Hay ain't got</i>
<i>a mudeing bone in nis body</i>

He probably just ripped off some old lady
or stole a car or something.

You were just trying to make a quick buck,
weren't you, Harry?

Yeah, that was it. It was Schwartz.
He was set up.

<i>He told me all about it He thought it was legit</i>

You say that again,
I'm gonna punt my cigarette out on your face.

Jesuns, Harry,
it was just a fucking figure of speech.

<i>You gotta lean now to lighten up</i>

You fucking slimy bastard!

You're a fucking dead man!

<i>Filthy bastard</i>

You sick man.

Oh, Jesus, Harry, you're killing me.

It's a Continental.

<i>Custom convertible one of a kind</i>

<i>Hell it's gotta be wotn at least</i>

<i>5000 goddamn dollas</i>

Well, hell, you win, Harry.

Well, Harry, you're a rich son of a bitch now.

5,000 big ones in cash and that car
ounght to get you pretty far.

That is, if you stay out of trounble. What are you
gonna do with that fat wad of cash?

The first thing I wanna do is drive
this hunnk of junnk straight to the Nevada border.

Then I'm gonna sit my buntt down
at a poker table

<i>and tun tnat $5000 into a fotune</i>

And then I'm gonna live my life
as far away as possible

from dounble-talking, scunmbag con artists,
like the two of you funck s.

You know, I've seen a lot of chunmp slags,
pea brains and two-bit palookas,

<i>Tnis is numiliating</i>

You sunre don't mind flaunnting what you've got.

Excunse me. This ountfit is not my idea.

So what now? I waste five hounrs of my life.

Good going with the gunn, Harry.
Yeah, very good going, Harry.

I sunppose you're gonna blame this on me, too,

<i>All you fiends being cnauffeued off</i>

<i>I don't know baby</i>

The way I look at it,
you've got no bunsiness talking about my life...

...becaunse yours ain't any better.

Harry?

What?

Do you hate me?

Mm-hm.

No, I don't hate you. I'm just kidding.

Sometimes I feel like giving you a whack,
believe me.

Then sometimes, I...

I wanna give you a kiss.

Like right now.

So come here.

Oh.

Jesuns.

We lost five of ounr best men.

Only two of yours were hit.

SANTINO: <i>I've execised tne geatest estaint</i>

Mama Martuncci, I said to Rico today,

"Rico, my eyes, they munst be deceiving me.

Mama Martuncci wounld never allow this."

Am I right, Rico?

The boss doesn't lie.

Vincenzo says you will have your three lives.

And the girl munst be one of the three.

No.

Do you see these fingers?

No.

You know why?

Becaunse they're not there.

You want a war, Mama Martuncci?

O <i>do you want to continue business as usual?</i>

The girl... munst die.

<i>So don't tnink you'e gonna get me</i>
<i>to tnat meeting</i>

DANNY: <i>Do you figue</i>
<i>tnis gave digge's gonna stop us?</i>

<i>You'e damn staignt it wasn't pal</i>

She's more than bunms like you and me deserve.

She's a lot of trounble.

She had a job to complete, my friend.

She did what she had to do.

What do you want, some fucking bimbo?

<i>And besides Hay sne was ignt about you</i>

<i>You've got nobody to blame but youself</i>

<i>You've got to smaten up and stop letting</i>

She's a lot of trounble.

GRANDMA: <i>You'e going away sweet gil</i>

That school in Switzerland we spoke of.

Grandmother, how counld you?

I have anticipated this for some time.

The arrangements were made last week.

Raphael is taking you to the airport.

When? I have to pack.

Ted will help with your lunggage.

I'm sorry, Katerina.

This isn't fair.

It is the way you made it.

<i>Tnee's an ode tnat must be maintained</i>

You don't clip a mark without a contract,
like some mad dog.

We thounght it was cunte the first time
you went to Santino with your stiletto.

You were so young.

<i>But now tnee ae consequences</i>

<i>You'e too mucn like you fatne Kateina</i>

You wanted Papa killed, didn't you?

<i>You always blamed nim</i>
<i>fo wnat nappened to Mama</i>

He was never good enoungh or mean enoungh
for this family.

Grandpa wounld have done
something about Santino, not me.

He didn't do bunsiness with pimps.

I did not want this life.

You cannot choose what God ordains. It is fate.

I'm simply a servant of my beloved Vincenzo.

Kit, why don't you get in the car?

Get in the car.

Nc, back sceat

Why?

Are you going?

Yes.

Why?

Nanny!

Nanny!

Kit...
Kiss my fucking toe right now!

Don't do this.
Kiss my feet, Danny!

Good idea.

Mwah, mwah.
Lick.

We gotta get out of this town, Harry.

No shit.

Do we have enoungh gas to get to Mexico?

I think we've probably got enoungh
to make it a lot funrther than that.

Hey, Kit, why don't you make me a drink?
I think it's time to celebrate.

Well, that's what happens

SANTINO: <i>Yean you get it blown to bits</i>

You've just gotta go with the flow.

You know what's weird, Harry?
I've spent years of my life trying to kill this guny

<i>and now ne's dead</i>

Speaking in psychiatric terms, I have to say
that I misinterpreted my demons.

<i>I let tne wong tnings un my life</i>
<i>You know I cnannelled</i>

all my anger from being a lonely kid
and missing my dad

to a life that was totally unseless and negative.

You know what I mean?

No.
