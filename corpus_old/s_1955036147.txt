Let him burn!

You are going to die!

This is the last one!

We have her!

Let's go, boys!

You will never get her! Never!

I've been hit!

Keep going! Go!

You will get what you deserve.

You will get yours.

You are the damned.

He's going for his gun!

Let's go! Let's go!

Be thankful my son dragged you here
behind his horse.

There are stories of a killer on the trail.

He awakens.

Look at him.

He awakens and does not know where he is.

This one wants to steal a horse.

You brought an evil white man into our camp.

This diseased filth needs to go.

At the last village they told a story about
a killer out there killing men and taking women.

You saw him.

He was possessed by evil spirits!

Seven winters...

Seven women.

Father, it is my duty to honor my commitment
to save his life.

Go on, son.

I tried to force him into cold waters
with my bow.

When his gun overcame me he spared my life.

Your foolishness has brought a great burden.

We will find out what kind of man
you have brought amongst us.

Bring him to the sweat lodge.

Let us see how the white man likes
our peyote.

This one must go now.

This man is your responsibility.

You have honored your debt to him.

Give him your horse so he leaves and
never comes back.

May you find your way.

Crazy man!

Go now!

Crazy man.

Go. Go now!

Crazy man!

Go now!

Where is CÃ©sar?

I want to leave.

Over there.

Let's go, CÃ©sar!

Relax Guillermo, we are almost to the house!

Stay!

He will kill us all.

Let's go!

We have to get her to safety!

Listen! Listen!

Get the children!

Get into the house!

Fast! Fast! Fast!

My sister will never be with you.

Come out and face me!

If you touch her I will kill you!

I am going to kill you!

I am not afraid. I am not afraid.

Don't do it.

We can stop.

There does not need to be any more death.
