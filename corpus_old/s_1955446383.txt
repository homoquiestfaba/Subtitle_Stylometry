Hi, I'm Michael.

Paul.

I hear you're
having some trouble.

It's okay.

It's okay.

I just...

Don't understand...

Why god made me like this.

He didn't.

Trust me.

Let me tell you something.

You should never
define yourself

by your choices
or your desires.

Gay doesn't exist.
It's a false identity.

This isn't my choice.
Why would I choose this?

You always have a choice.

You wanna go to heaven, right?

Yes.

If you're
a moral person,

then you'll choose
heterosexuality

in order to be with god.

Hey.

Hey. Hey.

Where you going?

I'm gonna make us breakfast.

No.

Yeah, come on.

Breakfast
is the most important part
of the day.

I'll have muffins
at my meeting.

Muffins?

Yeah, muffins.

Blueberry.

Mmm, blueberry.

Okay, then we'll
do lunch, okay?

Mmm, morning breath.

Oh, stop it!
Get off!

It's so cool
that you work at<i> XY.</i>

Yeah. Yeah, it's rad.

You guys are like
the only cool gay magazine
out there right now.

Oh, yeah, sort of.

Hey, listen up, queens.

<i> XY</i> magazine is taking over!

It's our time to shine!

<i> Matthew Shepard</i>
<i> was an openly gay man.</i>

<i> When he went to a laramie,</i>
<i> Wyoming bar last week,</i>

<i> these two suspects</i>
<i> lured him outside,</i>

<i> pretending to be gay.</i>

<i> Now they're charged</i>
<i> with a vicious attack</i>

<i> that left Shepard</i>
<i> hanging on this fence</i>

<i> for 18 hours</i>
<i> in freezing temperatures.</i>

<i> Shepard remained on</i>
<i> life support until this morning</i>

<i> when he passed away.</i>

<i> Shepard's family</i>
<i> is grateful for support</i>

<i> from around the world.</i>

They killed him
because they were afraid,

and they were afraid
because of what
their churches tell them

and because of what
they see in movies.

It's fucking ridiculous.

I hope they get
the death penalty.

You're against
the death penalty.
Not in this case.

That's like being
for free speech

until someone tells you
something that pisses you off.

He died a slow death

after being tied to a fence
and tortured.

Exactly, a slow death
is way more painful.

They should spend the rest
of their lives in prison.

Okay, look, we need
to move away from labels

because they segment
and they lead to persecution.

People don't wanna be
perceived as gay because...

They're afraid
they'll end up like Matthew.

But we are a gay magazine.

Identifying as gay
is being part of a community.

It's recognition,
it's progress...

We've been telling the kids
in the magazine to come out,
to be proud to be gay.

They should be proud
to be themselves.

Gay and straight
are just social constructs.

Ugh. God,
you and your queer theory.

Class is in session
with professor Michael glatze.

Shut up.

Okay, okay, look.

We need to put out the message

that being attracted
to the same sex

doesn't define who you are.

Hey.

Have you been smoking?

Just one.

Small one.

It was a small cigarette.

Busted.

Letters to the editor.

Ninety percent
are some poor teen
with religious parents.

Fucking Christian
fundamentalists
should burn in hell.

Uh, okay.

In the meantime,
there is a design competition

for the halifax
international airport.

I don't wanna move
to halifax.

I know, but my father
wants me to head up
the bid committee.

It's huge.

Halifax is so boring.

Your hometown is boring.

It's not.

Olympia?
Yeah.

It's all trees
and fog and coffee.

And the birthplace
of the riot grrrl movement

and where Kurt cobain
wrote most of<i> nevermind.</i>

Oh, well...

Yeah.
In that case...

But it's
unsustainable here,

unless you're in
the dot-com movement,

and I don't wanna live
in a studio on mission street

when we're 50.

Well, we won't be.

We'll be in a big mansion
on a hill. Duh.

<i> May 21st, 2000.</i>

<i> I used to imagine myself</i>
<i> growing old</i>

<i> while living in a house</i>
<i> atop a hill in the Castro,</i>

<i> but what's more important to me</i>

<i> is growing old</i>
<i> with the love of my life:</i>

<i> Bennett.</i>

<i> So I'm leaving San Francisco</i>

<i> to live in halifax, Canada.</i>

<i> Although I'm sad</i>
<i> to leave</i> XY<i> magazine,</i>

<i> I'm excited to finally accept</i>
<i> the speaking offers</i>

<i> I've been receiving</i>
<i> this past year,</i>

<i> thanks to my work</i>
<i> as a writer and activist.</i>

What a lot of people
aren't aware of

is that the terms "heterosexual"
and "homosexual"

were only introduced
about a hundred years ago.

<i> As my mother</i>
<i> used to always say,</i>

<i> "when you help others,</i>

<i> you're helping yourself</i>
<i> as well."</i>

We often read about
more sexually...

<i> My goal is to thread a needle</i>

<i> through the fabric</i>
<i> of this country</i>

<i> and stitch together the lives</i>
<i> of gay kids everywhere.</i>

I know a lot of you

are balancing religion
and sexuality,

but I mean, come on,

what god would punish you
for finding love?

This is where I spread
my mom's ashes.

Oh, my god.

She's still here.

Mom, I'm gonna
stay here with you.

No.

Don't be stubborn.

You are not skipping
a semester to be with me.

I can help you through this.

I'm gonna be fine.
I told you.

I feel better.

Really, Michael.

I am so proud of you.

I love you so much.

Hmm. I love you.

I should've stayed.

Everyone kept saying,

"don't worry, we're praying
for her, don't worry."

Everyone's gonna die.

No amount of praying
is ever gonna change that.

You're not getting up yet.
Five minutes more.

<i> I can't believe I'm approaching</i>
<i> my one-year anniversary</i>

<i> here in halifax,</i>
<i> Nova Scotia, Canada.</i>

<i> The food is amazing,</i>
<i> especially the Sushi.</i>

<i> The people are friendly</i>
<i> and although the gay community</i>

<i> is much smaller</i>
<i> than San Francisco,</i>

<i> I have some big plans</i>
<i> to really make an impact.</i>

What's wrong with you?

Nothing.

Look, I have to find
something else to do.

I'm just not cut out
for administrative work.

Give it some time?

I have things
i wanna do.

I want my own magazine.
I want something bigger.

I want...
I want to influence people.

I can't do that here.
You're being such a shit.

We made the decision
to leave San Francisco together.

No, we didn't.

I mean,
you had to take this job.

Just like you had
to take the job
that took us to San Francisco.

Which is how you got
your job at<i> XY,</i>
so you should be thanking me.

Is this...

This is supposed to be
Mexican food?

Why don't you go to the store
and make your own food?

Maybe I will.

You'll have to ask me
for money, though,

'cause you don't have any,
remember?

Thanks.

Hey.

Hey.

You're Mike, right?

Uh, yeah.

The<i> XY</i> survivor guide
really helped me out.

Are you stalking me
or something?

Tyler.

Hi.

Hi.

I just...
I wanted you to know

I agree with everything
that you say

about gay identity
and sexuality.

I don't wanna be
put into a box
just because I'm gay.

You don't wanna be in a box?

No, I don't wanna be in a box.

You're so fucking cute.

Can I buy you a drink?

Don't you have a boyfriend?

Hmm...
He'll think you're cute, too.

It's a galaxy.

Uh, actually it's a spiral.

It's the only symbol
that means anything.

It's infinite,
no beginning, no end.

There's a beginning
and there's an end.

All right, well, there's
a more complicated one

that has no beginning
and no end,

but I can't do it
on my pancakes, okay?

How did you guys meet?

How did we meet?

Uh, San Francisco.

We volunteered at this
aids prevention organization.

And we both got arrested
protesting this
Christian coalition event.

Which is how I knew
it was true love.

Awesome.

How about you?
What's your deal?

Who are you?

Uh...

I'm a physics student.

Really?
Yeah.

Physics.
Science.

Yeah. I wanna be an astronaut,
but that's probably a long shot.

Oh, god. I'd be terrified
to go into space.

It's just, to me,

earth is just this,
like, tiny speck
in the universe.

And humans have only
been around for just
a speck of that timeline.

So it's just...

There has to be more to life
than just this, don't you think?

Totally.

Totally.

So Tyler
was really cute, huh?

Interesting.
Mm-hmm.

It is interesting, isn't it?

Very interesting.

You know why?

Because I love you so much.

And I really feel like
we're at a place
in our relationship

where there's more
than enough love to go around.

And I know that
I'm not afraid of that

and I don't think
that you are either.

Mm-mm. Maybe I am afraid.

Well, you shouldn't
be afraid

because I'm here
to protect you.
Why?

Carrot thief.

Here's our very uncool
soccer mom Van.

Whoo!

Who are these guys?

<i> July 23rd, 2002.</i>

Road trip.
Road trip.

<i> I'm driving across America</i>
<i> with Bennett and Tyler</i>

<i> for an exciting new project</i>
<i> I'm working on.</i>

I guess both beds are taken.

I don't know where
you're gonna sleep.

Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

This is the most fun
I've ever had in my whole life.

Really?
No.

<i> We are making a documentary</i>

<i> about queer youth in America,</i>

<i> because discrimination</i>
<i> against lgbt youth</i>

<i> must be eliminated.</i>

<i> I just wish people could see</i>
<i> that these kids have faces,</i>

<i> names, and voices</i>
<i> that need to be heard.</i>

Growing up in the church
and realizing that you're gay

is very difficult.

You know, your family
has never talked about it.

I mean, I'm 13

and it's the first time
I've heard the word.

And when I heard the word
and knew what it was,

then it was like,
"hey, I know that.

I understand that.
That's me."

My mom, she's trying.

She's like really in the closet
about it.

She won't mention it to anybody
or anything like that.

Like, she tries to still act
like I'm straight

and expects me to act like
I'm straight along with her

when I'm not like that.

And this was
probably more overwhelming

when I tried
to kill myself, uh...

But I felt so invisible

to everyone around me
who was straight.

There are times when I realize

that I'm just as much a creation
of god as everyone else.

Olympia, Washington.

This is kind of somber.

But even though I grew up here,

because both my parents
don't live anymore,

it feels like this place
is a part of a past

that doesn't exist anymore.

And I wasn't gay here.

I mean, you couldn't be.

There was this kid that everyone
just thought was gay

and he had to leave school
'cause he got picked on so much.

What's it like here?

Liberty is falwell territory.

So as you can imagine,
it's not very gay-friendly.

So why do you stay?

Uh...

Well, I...

I don't know. I, um...

I didn't come out
to friends and family

until last year.

And I have another year
before I graduate.

I'm a Christian.

So...

Which a lot of people
think is impossible,

but I think that's
just as ridiculous

as the anti-gay right, so...

Just a second.

Hey, sof.

Do you want us
to call them for you?

We're just gonna...
We're gonna wait with you
until he comes, okay?

Her mother just passed.
Do you mind not filming us?

So awful.

Here, let's pray.
Let's pray for her, okay?

All right, turn it off.

We just wanna ask, father,

that you would
just give her the strength

to get through this
incredibly difficult time

and we pray that you
would just fill us all

with the compassion to know
what she must be going through

because it would be impossible
for us to fully comprehend.

Just show her yourself, father,
during this time

and look to you right now,
father...

Hey.

Babe.

We gotta go.
We gotta be there at 9:30.
You ready?

Yeah.
All right.
See you in the car.

<i> I didn't come out</i>
<i> to friends and family</i>

<i> until last year.</i>

<i> I'm a Christian.</i>

<i> So...</i>

<i> Which a lot of people</i>
<i> think is impossible,</i>

<i> but I think that's</i>
<i> just as ridiculous</i>

<i> as the anti-gay right, so...</i>

<i> When I was young, I didn't know</i>
<i> that there were people like me.</i>

<i> I felt lost, alone,</i>
<i> and confused.</i>

<i> I never even told my mother,</i>
<i> my best friend, that I was gay</i>

<i> because I was afraid</i>
<i> she wouldn't accept me.</i>

<i> That's why</i>
<i> we're on this journey:</i>

<i> To let gay kids know</i>
<i> that they are not alone.</i>

<i> And you know what?</i>
<i> I learned a lot as well.</i>

<i> Because we met</i>
<i> so many amazing people</i>

<i> who've heard their parents</i>
<i> or pastors</i>

<i> tell them they're wrong</i>
<i> and yet they've come</i>

<i> to the realization</i>
<i> that they're beautiful,</i>

<i> blessed, and that god</i>
<i> loves them just as they are.</i>

<i> I mean, people who believe</i>
<i> that homosexuality is wrong</i>

<i> are gonna change their minds</i>
<i> thanks to this next generation.</i>

The sky is fucking beautiful.

What is this, babe?

Hmm?

Oh, it's stupid.

Just somebody gave it to me
on the street.

"Where will we go
when we die?"

Baby.

You guys,
where will we go
when we die?

In 2012, the world
is supposed to end.

Is that a real thing?

I hope not.

Everyone knows this.

It's what they drew
on the Mayan calendar.

You know,
the Mayan calendar thing.

That's what they drew.
It was the moon and the sun.

What? I'm curious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

We wanna know. Please.
We wanna know. Please.

I don't think
they wanna know.

Mike.

You guys go on.
I'll meet you at home.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Where are you going?

Michael?

What's that about?
I have absolutely
no earthly idea.

Baby.

I was worried about you today.
What's going on?

It's stupid.

Baby, nothing's stupid.
Tell me what.

Do you think when we die,

we just disappear
like we never existed?

No, I don't think that.

Because I know that
we'll always be together.

Baby.

Baby.

Baby, you're okay.
I'm here.

Let's pray for her.
Let's pray.

Bennett!

Bennett!

I'm really lightheaded.

It's okay. It's okay.
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

Okay.

Your heartrate
seems to have returned
back to normal.

Can you check again?

Just because your father had hcm
does not mean that you have it.

We followed
our chest pain protocol
and there's nothing abnormal.

You had a panic attack. Okay?

Where's Bennett?

He's in the lobby.

As soon as you're checked out,
you can see him.

All right?

Thank you.

<i> I was 13 years old,</i>

<i> walking along the beach</i>
<i> with my father,</i>

<i> when he suddenly collapsed</i>
<i> and died</i>

<i> from an unexpected</i>
<i> heart condition.</i>

<i> If I've inherited his disease,</i>

<i> the same thing</i>
<i> could happen to me.</i>

What's wrong, baby?

It's happening again.
I can feel it.

The tests confirmed that--
they don't know.

They don't care.

<i> Now I'm having</i>
<i> heart palpitations</i>
<i> all the time.</i>

<i> And contrary to what</i>
<i> the doctors keep saying,</i>

<i> I just know</i>
<i> they aren't panic attacks.</i>

<i> After months of fighting</i>
<i> with my insurance,</i>

<i> I was finally allowed</i>
<i> to see a specialist</i>

<i> who could definitively test</i>
<i> whether or not</i>

<i> I inherited</i>
<i> my father's condition.</i>

<i> Now I have to wait</i>
<i> for the results.</i>

Michael,
just calm down.
Calm down!

Do you know
what this disease means?

It means
i could die any minute,
just drop dead!

You calm down!

Dr. Williams?

Hi.

Thank you, god.

Thank you, god.

<i> The test confirmed</i>

<i> that I did not inherit</i>
<i> my father's heart condition.</i>

<i> Although it's</i>
<i> a massive sigh of relief,</i>

<i> I keep thinking to myself...</i>

<i> If I was really</i>
<i> just having panic attacks,</i>

<i> then what's wrong with me?</i>

<i> What am I afraid of?</i>

<i> All I know is that when</i>
<i> faced with your own death,</i>

<i> it reminds you</i>
<i> of what's important in life.</i>

<i> And for me,</i>
<i> that's helping other people.</i>

Okay.

<i> So I've decided</i>
<i> to start my own magazine.</i>

<i> I'm calling it</i> yga.

Young gay Americans.

<i> It's gonna be the biggest</i>
<i> and most sophisticated magazine</i>

<i> aimed at improving the lives</i>
<i> of lgbt youth.</i>

Hmm.

What is this?

What is this?

Oh, my god! Hi!

You didn't.

I know you
wanted one, baby.

Oh, my god!

Ooh.

What are we gonna call you?

What are we gonna call you?

Olly. Olly, heel.

I've been thinking
about the next issue of<i> yga.</i>

I think we need to address
this whole christianity thing.

What do you mean?

Well, people think that gays
and christians are enemies.

We've met so many people
who've managed to balance
their faith and their sexuality.

But we've also met
so many people whose parents

and churches tell them
they're gonna burn in hell.

Yeah, which is why
we should address it
in the magazine.

I mean, the whole "you're gay,
you're going to hell" myth

was started by mistranslations
and misinterpretations
of the Bible.

I mean, god doesn't care
what your sexual orientation is.

And the one thing
that the gay movement
doesn't understand

that I think christianity does

is that not everyone
wants to be a part
of the subculture.

I'm sorry,
what did you do
with my boyfriend?

Shut up.

I'm not gonna write like...

Gospel according to Michael
or something.

<i> It might seem strange</i>
<i> for a gay youth magazine</i>

<i> to dedicate an entire issue</i>
<i> to religion,</i>

<i> but it's too important</i>
<i> to ignore.</i>

<i> When my parents died,</i>
<i> I blamed god.</i>

<i> When I came out,</i>

<i> I distanced myself even further</i>
<i> from religion.</i>

<i> You see, I thought I was</i>
<i> too smart to believe in god,</i>

<i> that he was only</i>
<i> for the needy.</i>

<i> But after</i>
<i> a recent health scare,</i>

<i> I felt this nudging</i>
<i> in the back of my mind:</i>

<i> The presence of god.</i>

<i> And you know what?</i>

<i> I was no longer afraid.</i>

Aah!

<i> Some religious figures</i>
<i> spout hateful rhetoric</i>

<i> and try to force</i>
<i> a monopoly on the truth.</i>

<i> But the only truth is love.</i>

<i> The only sin is denying love.</i>

<i> Stop hating.</i>

<i> Start loving.</i>

You gonna join us?

Uh, yeah, just one second.

What?

Uh, you're really combing
through that thing,
aren't you?

Look, my whole life,
i thought the Bible
was full of hate...

And it's not.

There's a lot of love in here.

So your interest in the Bible
is more than just research?

Well, there's a lot
of Christian roots
in my family,

my mom, my aunt and...

Just curious.

Your aunts disowned you
when you came out.

That's not family.

I'm all for curiosity but--

i-i just feel like
something saved me,

shook me and woke me up.

And that someone is god?

Mike, he didn't save you
because you were never dying.

Okay.

"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

Don't see many people
flaunting that out in the open.

Oh.

I've seen you
reading out here before

and I thought maybe you'd
wanna come to my church.

Any Sunday,
just to check it out.

See what the mormon religion
has to offer.

The gospel teaches us
that we are the spirit children

of heavenly parents.

Now, many people ask,
are we like other christians?

Why of course we are.

We believe in Jesus Christ

and we believe
in life after death.

And everyone is welcome
at the lds church.

Christ's atonement
allows mankind to be saved
from their sins...

And to return to live with god
and their loved ones in heaven.

Did you grow up
with any kind of faith?

Not really.

My mother was Christian,

but she didn't really take
me or my sister to church,

and my father
was a Berkeley hippie,

kind of agnostic
or even atheist.

They were very good people

and I know
I'll see them again in heaven.

My mom passed away as well.

So I know how hard that is.

I was so afraid and angry,
you know?

Yeah, me, too.

It's really hard
to deal with death

when you don't know
where you're going.

But once you do,
then you have peace

and you realize
that god's not to blame.

Right.
Yeah.

Catherine.

It was nice to meet you.

You, too.

She's single, fyi.

Fyi?

What, you think
she likes me?

Yeah. Yeah,
it seemed like it.

But I mean, don't worry.
There's plenty of single ladies
looking for a husband.

I wasn't even thinking
about that kind of thing.

Oh, well, maybe it's something
you should start thinking about.

I can get you in touch with her
if you want.

Oh, um...

If you're interested.

Sure. I don't know.

Yeah?
Okay. Whatever.
Yeah, okay.

All right.
Okay, thanks.

Embarrassing me
a little bit.

<i> Welcome back to new beginnings</i>

<i> and thank you for listening</i>
<i> to our continued conversation</i>

<i> about the truth path to heaven.</i>

<i> Doctor, how would you respond</i>
<i> to other christians</i>

<i> who disagree with your angle?</i>

<i> Look, all I'm trying</i>
<i> to do is help people.</i>

<i> It just pains me so much when</i>
<i> I hear so-called christians</i>

<i> side with the left on issues</i>
<i> such as homosexuality.</i>

<i> Now, I'm not condoning hate.</i>

<i> In fact, this is about love.</i>

<i> Choosing a gay identity</i>
<i> will condemn you</i>

<i> to an eternity of suffering.</i>

<i> And I wanna save people</i>
<i> from that.</i>

<i> Whether it's abortion</i>
<i> or adultery</i>

<i> or accepting religions</i>
<i> other than christianity,</i>

<i> you must obey god's law</i>

<i> or you will not be allowed</i>
<i> into his kingdom.</i>

I'm not saying that.
I'm not saying
that it's wrong.

I'm just saying
that over the course
of thousands of years,

people with an agenda
have made christianity
what it is today.

Yeah, but the original message
is still the same,
it's about love.

You know, I would've never
pegged you as a Buddhist.

Why?

What, 'cause I don't look
a certain way?

No, I...

I don't know why
i just said that.

I'm just kidding you.

Meditation.

People get weird in their head
about meditation.

They think it's weird
or hippie.

I think it's about
developing mindfulness.

You know, it's about
living moment to moment.

And in a deeper level,
it's about knowing yourself.

That's why I started
volunteering at
the Buddhist center.

They have classes on Friday.
You should come.

Oh, I have to go out of town
for this speaking thing.

What kind of speaking thing?

It's about gay youth
in America.

No way. That's awesome.

Welcome to our very first panel

on being young and gay
in America.

Joining us is Judy Shepard,

president of
the Matthew Shepard foundation,

dedicated to
working towards causes

championed by her son Matthew
during his life.

Thank you for joining us.

Michael glatze,
former editor of<i> XY</i> magazine,

recipient of equality forum's
national role model award

as well as lambda's
literary award

for<i> XY's</i> survival guide,

participant in the
award-winning documentary

<i> Jim in bold,</i>

and co-founder
of<i> young gay Americans,</i>

which is now
a full-fledged magazine.

What does being gay
mean to you?

<i> Gay doesn't mean the same thing</i>
<i> that it meant 20 years ago.</i>

<i> And it's more important now</i>
<i> than ever</i>

<i> to make allies</i>
<i> and make alliances</i>

<i> both inside</i>
<i> and outside the gay community.</i>

<i> Gay doesn't mean the same thing</i>
<i> that it meant 20 years ago.</i>

<i> It's not about--</i>

hey.

No.

I have to walk the dog.

Hey.

What are you doing?

I need some space.

Mike--
look, I just...

I need some time
to figure this out,

to see where this
is taking me.

Why can't you come to me
for help?

We have to talk about this
before--

look, I just...

I need to get away
from this life.

Our life?
Yes.

And what exactly is it
about our life that you need
to get away from, being gay?

I don't know.

I don't know!

Okay, uh, are you
attracted to women?

Because if that's the case,
then fine, go explore.

I just wanna be with my parents
in heaven. Is that so hard
to understand?

Can you even hear yourself
right now?

What happened
to the misinterpretation
of the Bible?

It's a fucking book, Mike!

I read the Bible the same way
i read anything else,

with an open mind
and an open heart.

Oh, is that what
you call this?

'Cause the way you're talking
doesn't exactly sound
very fucking open-minded.

This relationship
has just developed
into something unhealthy.

What does that even mean?

Tyler?

You were just as
interested in that as I was.

No.

I just wanted you
to be happy

because I was afraid
you were gonna leave.

I was never
gonna leave, Mike.

I've stood by you.

I've held your hand while you
were so terrified of dying

that you created illnesses
that didn't even exist.

The truth is that
i was living a lie.

The truth is that god loves us--
shut the fuck up!

Okay.

Wait.

Please don't go.

Where are you going?

The thing
that will really kill you...

Is repressing
who you truly are.

That's what you
should really be afraid of.

So he just left this here
out in the open?

<i> I have come to a decision</i>
<i> that will be shocking</i>

<i> to anyone I used to relate to.</i>

<i> The presence of god</i>
<i> has grown strong in my life.</i>

<i> He told me</i>
<i> that my panic attacks</i>

<i> were caused by my shallow,</i>
<i> sinful lifestyle.</i>

<i> I've come to the realization</i>
<i> that identifying as gay</i>

<i> prevents you from finding</i>
<i> your true self within.</i>

<i> And we must be our true selves</i>

<i> in order to join god</i>
<i> in his kingdom.</i>

<i> Therefore, I,</i>
<i> Michael glatze,</i>

<i> no longer identify</i>
<i> as gay.</i>

Why did you do it?

"Gay activist goes straight"?

You gave the anti-gay right
the story of their dreams.

I don't know why.

I don't know.

Who pushed you?

No one.

I just wanted
to tell my story.

Look, I think
this all happened

because god needed
to teach me a lesson.

That's why I'm here,
to make it better.

Meditation is a way
of slowing down

and developing kindness
towards yourself.

Through mindfulness practice,
we develop strength of mind.

We become more present

and we learn
to appreciate our world.

<i> God works in mysterious ways.</i>

<i> He has sent me to a place</i>

<i> where I can get away</i>
<i> from the physical world</i>

<i> so that I can focus</i>
<i> on my true self--</i>

<i> a happier, healthier man,</i>

<i> free of unnatural desires.</i>

<i> At first, I didn't understand</i>
<i> why god would send a Christian</i>

<i> to a Buddhist retreat.</i>

<i> But I have faith</i>
<i> in his plan for me.</i>

<i> Desire is powerful.</i>

<i> And god is testing me.</i>

<i> But I refuse to give in</i>
<i> to temptation.</i>

<i> I've come to the realization</i>

<i> that god wants me</i>
<i> to use meditation</i>

<i> to rid myself</i>
<i> of abnormal desires.</i>

God gave Buddha the light
to be Buddha.

He did.

Michael,
what are you talking about?

I just want us
to be on the right path
for our future,

for our health,
for the afterlife.

I am on the right path, okay?
My path.

Michael, i--
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Nico.

It's the same kind of strength

that you need
to-to clear your mind.

You know, we just, we need
to find that strength

to fight what we both know
in our hearts is wrong.

We just have to fight it.

Stop, Michael. Stop.

No, I mean...

Michael, you're confused.

You're very confused
and it's at my expense.

<i> People have been asking</i>
<i> how I am.</i>

<i> Some out of support.</i>

<i> Others who think</i>
<i> I've reconsidered.</i>

<i> I've come to the realization</i>
<i> that Bennett represents soul,</i>

<i> Tyler represents body,</i>
<i> Nico represents mind.</i>

<i> Father, son, holy ghost.</i>

<i> I guess god need me</i>
<i> to complete the Trinity</i>

<i> in order to move on.</i>

<i> So I'm ready to set</i>
<i> the record straight.</i>

<i> I was a heterosexual person</i>
<i> with a homosexual problem,</i>

<i> and I took care</i>
<i> of that problem.</i>

<i> I have not reconsidered.</i>

A good number of people
have come forward

and expressed
their concern

about your being involved
with this organization.

This center is supposed
to accept everyone.

Yes, and we do.

We welcome people
of all beliefs,

but we don't tolerate hate.

I don't hate anybody.

Michael, you've written
what some would call
very hateful things.

Those are my beliefs.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

Are you okay?

I don't know...

I don't understand
what has changed, but I, uh...

Here we practice compassion.

And I'm just, I'm afraid
this isn't gonna work out.

So, because I'm Christian
and I express my opinions...

I have to leave.

That's so messed up.

That's really everything?

Your whole life
is in that one bag?

Yeah.

Do you think
you'll stay here?

I mean, San Francisco
can't be the best place
for an...

Ex-gay.

I'm not an ex-gay.
I'm just me.

Honestly, I thought
you'd be happy.

I mean, you never
really approved.

That's not true.

Then why haven't we been close?

I mean, you're my sister.

We're supposed to be there
for each other.

We can be close now.

I'm glad you're here.

And I want you to be happy--
loving whomever.

Yeah?

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

No, I can't.
What?

No, I'm sorry. Uh...

What happened?
I can't. Um...

It's not you, it's...
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Olly, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

<i> Hello?</i>

Michael?

<i> Bennett.</i>

Where are you?

<i> Are you okay?</i>

<i> Michael?</i>

I have to go.

<i> Wait, why did you call me,</i>
<i> Michael?</i>

To my friends who are trapped
in homosexuality:

I wanna thank you
for your kind comments

and keen observations
regarding my story

and my revelation that
i am no longer homosexual

and am now heterosexual.

The gay identity has been
packaged and fed to you,

and if you identify as gay
then you have eaten it,

preventing you
from further growth

and understanding
of your true self.

<i> But it's not too late</i>
<i> to save yourself.</i>

<i> If you follow my lead.</i>

<i> I am confident.</i>
<i> I am blessed.</i>

<i> I am strong.</i>

<i> I am ready to give up</i>
<i> my life for Christ</i>

<i> in order to find</i>
<i> my true self.</i>

You sure you
don't want a coffee?

I don't drink coffee anymore.

You're well?

Yeah. Why?

Just asking.

I'm great.
I've never been better.

Well, I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

So does Bennett.

Hmm.

I wish I could understand
what you're going through.

I just don't want to be
perceived as gay

for the rest of my experiences.

It's that simple.

Are you still
with Bennett?

No.

I'm, uh, going to Europe
to study space science.

That's great.

I'm going
to Bible school.

God told me
to become a pastor.

I don't want to open
old wounds or anything,

but I also don't know when
I'll ever see you again.

I want you to know
how much you meant to me.

I know you don't care anymore.

But I needed to say it.

For closure.

This whole thing...

It broke my heart.

Tyler...

I'm sorry.

But I need to live
for myself now.

Okay.

Okay.

Take care.

Now, sometimes somebody's
gonna ask you what you believe.

They're gonna say,
"you're a Christian,

all right,
what do you believe?"

Maybe they're an atheist
or a agnostic or a Muslim

or a Buddha, you know,
who knows what they are?

And you better be ready
to tell 'em.

We believe the Bible
is the word of god,

the supreme, final authority
in life and in our faith.

We believe in one god,

eternally existing
in three persons:

The father,
the son, and the holy spirit.

And we believe
the sole condition

for receiving
everlasting life

is belief and faith alone
in the lord Jesus Christ.

Thank you.

I'll have one
of those, please.

Hi, I'm Michael.

Uh, hi, I'm Rebekah.

Guess we like
all the same things.

I love it here.

I mean, I never though
I'd end up in Wyoming,

but I feel like I've
finally found my niche.

Where'd you think
you'd end up?

That's a good question.
I don't know.

All I know is that I've
always wanted to help people,

because some people
struggle so much

when the solution
is actually very simple.

It's right there
in Matthew 10:

The road may not be easy,
but if we give up our lives

for Christ, then we'll find
our true selves.

Where did you
go to college?

Dartmouth.

Wow.

And you majored in music?

In creative writing
and English literature,

but I minored
in music theory
and composition.

That must've kept you busy.

What kind of stuff
did you write?

Well, my thesis
was all poetry, actually.

Can I read some?

Oh, I don't have it anymore.

My poetry
is from a different life.

But I, um...

I'm so interested in music now
because it transcends language.

You know, it's like people
don't have to argue about it

or judge it
or misinterpret it.

They can just listen.

You know, I just play
and they just listen.

You know?

I don't know if I do,
to be honest,

but the way you say it,
i want to.

I'm sorry, I'm just blabbing.
What about you?

No, don't be sorry!
You're not blabbing. Um...

I majored in theater.

Theater? Really?
Yeah.

Yeah, it was really fun,
but it's not like
it's a real job.

I actually stage managed
a little bit after college,

but I don't know,
i felt adrift.

So I came here,
hoping to figure out my path.

Me, too.

I can't believe
you've never had Sushi.

Who hasn't had Sushi?
It's crazy.

Mm.

Oh, no.

You don't like it.

I'm sorry.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Oh...
I'm sorry.

No, I used to hate it
when my ex did that.

Always making decisions.

We can go somewhere else.
No.

No, no, no.
No, it's okay.

Are you sure?

Yes. Yeah.
You like it. It's fine.

Uh, how, um, how long ago
was the ex you mentioned?

Oh. It was a long time ago.
It was, uh...

I don't know why
i brought that up.

It was stupid.

Well, um, was it serious?

Were you gonna marry her?

It was serious,
but, um, no, not marriage.

What about you?

Oh, no, I've...

I've never been in
a serious relationship.

My parents are very,
very conservative.

Do you think
they'd approve of me?

The future pastor
i met at Bible school?

Yes, I think they'd approve.

Rebekah.

Hi.

Hi.

What?

I just...

Since when do you
wear shirts like that?

What? It's not inappropriate
and it's hot out.

You're here to serve our lord,
not distract our men.

I don't think
I'm distracting anyone.

Is this about Michael?

We are not letting what we have
get in the way of our studies.

Besides, the lord
brought us together.

It's about his past.

What about it?

You really don't know?

Know what?

Rebekah.

Oh. Hi.

Are we still meeting?

Yeah, just let me finish this.
I'll be right there.

Okay.
I'll be in the cafeteria.

Okay.

I have something
i have to tell you.

You already know,
don't you?

Are you still
attracted to men?

No.

It's in the past.

Okay, I...

God showed me the light.

He showed me the truth.

A lot of people have pasts
they're not proud of,

but god forgives, right?

My life has changed so much
since I've met you.

And my feelings for you
are real.

My feelings for you
are real, too.

But I feel like we should
just keep hanging out
and see what happens.

Maybe not settle on
anything too specific.

If that's okay.

Okay.

Hi, I'm Michael.

Now, I wanna tell you
a little secret

about a great gift from god.

This gift is a human emotion

and considered destructive
by the enemies of god.

Fear.

You can never, never,
never stop

fearing yourself.

We are our own worst enemies.

And we must fear ourselves till
the day we meet god himself.

God didn't put us here to live
our lives in constant fear.

No, of course not.

And then he scolded me
for asking questions.

Well, that's not fair.

We're here to learn

and we learn in part
by asking questions.

No, we're here to serve god,
not to identify

as the exact kind of christians
they want us to be.

I'm sorry.

Don't be.

You know what's best
because that's god
speaking through you.

You wanted to see me?

Now, you've been rallying
the students against us

as though you're
being controlled
by the devil himself.

I've learned a lot
about the Bible here,

and for that I thank you.

But I refuse to be controlled
by anyone other than god.

I follow my own path.

Yeah, and you want others
to follow you.

Perhaps it's best
if we mail you your diploma

and that you not attend
the ceremony.

I don't know if i
can stay here anymore.

Oh. Where will we go?

We?

Uh, I've been praying about it.

About us.

I told god how I feel about you
and how much you mean to me.

And you know what?

I was consumed
with nothing but peace.

Pure peace.

I love you.

I love you, too.

And be not conformed
to this world:

But be you transformed
by the renewing of your mind,

that you may prove
that good, glorious,

and perfect will of god.

That you may know that good,
acceptable,

and perfect will of god.

Which would you prefer to have?
Frosted flakes or fruit loops?

Well, obviously fruit loops.

Why? Why obviously?

Well, you're a fruit loop.

There you are.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Okay, got 'em.

You get everything?

Mm-hmm.

These are going to storage.

Well, so you can have
a little more room
for your shoes?

Shut up.

I have never seen anyone
with more shoes than you.

You can never have
too many shoes.

Get those out of here.

Hello?

<i> Hi.</i>

Hi.

<i> How are you?</i>

Good.

I finished school.

But I'm no longer
on their path.

<i> So what path</i>
<i> are you on now?</i>

My own.

<i> I'm going to be the pastor</i>
<i> of my own church.</i>

Why are you calling?

Um...

I, uh...

I got the picture
you sent of olly.

<i> I know it was months ago,</i>
<i> but I didn't respond.</i>

<i> So how is she?</i>

Oh, she's getting old.

But she's okay.

She has this

<i> stuffed animal that she</i>
<i> carries around with her now</i>

<i> everywhere she goes</i>
<i> like it's her baby.</i>

Bennett...

I should tell you
before someone else does.

I'm engaged.

To a...
Really amazing woman.

Now, I know
what you're thinking because

<i> I asked myself the same thing--</i>

<i> am I really in love with her</i>

<i> or am I only doing this</i>
<i> to be right in god's eyes?</i>

<i> And I'm truly</i>
<i> in love with her, Bennett.</i>

God went to the root
of my same sex desires

and he uprooted them.

He demonstrated
that they were abnormal.

<i> Michael...</i>

<i> I'm really glad</i>
<i> you think you're happy.</i>

And I wish you all the best.

I really do.
I think you know that.

<i> But I have no idea</i>
<i> why you would call me up</i>

<i> and use words like "abnormal."</i>

<i> I'm so sorry for the way</i>
<i> that things went down.</i>

<i> But just because we don't</i>

share certain beliefs,

it doesn't mean that
we can't still be friends.

I'll always be your friend.

<i> And I really hope</i>
<i> that this path</i>

<i> takes you where you wanna go.</i>

But I also hope that...

As you're setting out
to help other people...

<i> That you really take some time</i>
<i> to help yourself.</i>

<i> I-i am. I...</i>

<i> I'm not gonna sit here</i>
<i> and say that I know</i>

<i> I'll be this way</i>
<i> for the rest of my life.</i>

We're always changing, evolving.

And I'm open to that.

Then...

I guess nothing's
really changed.

<i> Yeah.</i>

<i> You take care</i>
<i> of yourself, okay?</i>

Goodbye, Michael.

Bye.

Here they come.
