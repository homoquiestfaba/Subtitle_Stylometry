[man narrating]
I hate to admit it,

but when I graduated
from college,

I thought I was ready
for anything.

That is until I stepped
off the train in Hangzhou.

Here I was in a country
of a billion people,

and I didn't know
a single one.

This place was different
than what I'd expected.

It wasn't at all like what
I'd seen in the Kung Fu movies
[grunting on TV]

No one else I knew stayed up
all night to watch that stuff,

but I was hooked.


The hero was always small
like me,

but he moved like the wind,

triumphed over evil

and brought the bad guys
to their knees,

and he always
got the girl.


[man speaking Chinese on P.A.]

Welcome to China.

Thank you. Thank you.

We are members
of the Foreign Affairs Bureau

of Hangzhou College.

We're responsible for the safety

and convenience of foreigners.

[man narrating]
It was incredible to me

how my whole life seemed
to lead up to this very moment.

Kung Fu lessons as a kid.

Washing dishes after school
in a Chinatown restaurant,

where I learned
to speak Chinese.

Then college, where I majored
in Chinese literature.

I was 11 when Nixon shook hands
with Mao.

By the time I was 22,
China had opened its doors.

In 1982, I grabbed the first
job that would take me there,

as an English teacher.

[camera shutter clicking]

[horn honking]


Huh?

Mr. Mark!

This is Teacher Hei.

Her name means "black."

She has agreed
to be your Chinese teacher

because you have learned
classical Chinese before.

Hi.

Do you want to talk
about your study schedule now?

He's wet now.

I will come back tomorrow
and bring the books you need.


It's too cold for you
to walk around like that.

You'll catch pneumonia.

to mix with the students

that first day,

but the Foreign Affairs Bureau,

following regulations,
provided a separate table

for their foreign friend.

[murmuring and giggling]

to teach a group

known as the middle aged
English teachers.

Most of them were
originally Russian teachers,

but for political reasons,

they had been told
to forget Russian

and learn English.

Hello.

I was very nervous.

Please sit down.

Good afternoon, Mr. Franklin.

Welcome you to China.

We are your English students.

We are sure you will be
a wonderful teacher.

Thank you very much.

But, please...

Call me Mark.

But you are a teacher.

In China,
we respect the teacher

So we must call you "Mr. Franklin."

But I'm young.

Just call me "Mark."

Then we will call
you "Mr. Mark."

Is that okay?

Really,
just Mark will be fine.

Then we call
"Teacher Mark"--

halfway Chinese,
halfway American.

Okay, Teacher Mark.

Wonderful. Already we have
solved the contradiction

All right, now that we've
decided what my name is,

why don't you introduce
yourselves to me?

Teacher Du is very fat,

so we call her Fatty Du
in our college.

She has a powerful voice.

Teacher Xu afraid
of me.

I am not.

Oh, but you are.

Teacher Cai
was a wonderful dancer

when he was a young man.

He's famous in our college

because he has
a very beautiful wife.

She's from the countryside

and has never seen
a foreigner before

but she'll get used to you,
Teacher Mark.

What's your name?

She's called Xiao Chun.

Her name means springtime.

Like the American name April.

April.

Yes.

Teacher Mark, can you also
give me an English name?

Let's see. Tell me something
about yourself.

I want to be
in the Navy.

"Sinbad"--
what does it mean?

Well, it really doesn't
mean anything,

but it's the name
of a very famous sailor.

Teacher Mark,
tell us something about you.

My hobby
is Chinese Kung Fu.

I think I've seen
every Kung Fu movie ever made.

I never saw that before.

Teacher Mark. Teacher Mark!

Teacher Mark!

[knocking on door]
He's sleeping.

to come see me any time,

so I was afraid Sinbad
had decided

to practice more English
at 5 in the morning,

but he said this is good.

what Sinbad had to do

to get me through those gates.

But somehow there we were,

in the Hangzhou Martial Arts
School, and there he was,

Pan Qingfu,
one of the most famous masters

in all of China,
a national champion.

He'd even played a villain
in Shaolin Temple,

my all-time favorite
Kung Fu movie.

I'd read that he was
as hard as his right hand,

which he developed

by punching an iron plate
a thousand times a day.

They called him
the Iron Fist.

[speaks Chinese]

calling Martial Arts Kung Fu,

but the word really means
more than that.

It's an attitude to be applied
to everything one does.

means to do something

with skill that transcends
surface beauty.

What would it be like
to achieve that,

to have a teacher
who could lead you

to that kind of mastery?

[sound of
metal clanging together]

to see right through me,

a soft American
who'd always had it easy

I wasn't sure what Teacher Pan
meant by "eating bitter",

but coming from a man
called Iron Fist,

it didn't sound promising.

I learned these characters

Want to see them?

In China,

when someone visits you
in your home,

you always offer them
tea and something to eat first.

Sorry. Sorry.

Here we go.

Oh, no. I've already eaten.
Thank you.

But you just said
you wanted something.

I did not.

I said, "You should offer
me something."

That is the Chinese way.

No, no, no.
That's wrong.

You should give it
to me anyway.

But you said
you didn't want anything.

I said that because that
is being polite.

You must still offer me
the candy.

Okay.

Now let's see
these characters.

I thought you said
you've learned them.

I did.

You must know them
by heart.

Next time,
no using the book.

You must master
each stroke

before you can go on.

Otherwise, everything
you do will be so-so.

Tell me about it.

Everything I touch
turns to so-so.

You're too impatient.

I'll come back
next week.

In the meantime,
memorize these characters.

Okay.

Thanks, Teacher Hei.
I'll see you next week.

Haven't you heard
the expression "suon ke" before?

To send a guest?

Yes.

You always walk your guest
part of the way home.


I was never sure
when the lesson was over,

only that she seemed so
determined to straighten me out

that it would be useless
to resist.

Oh, no.
You're too polite.

You don't have to walk me so far

No, it's no trouble.

It's my pleasure.

Good.
You're catching on.


No, I come here
for English books.

Your English is good.

Did you learn it in China?

Yes, of course.
Where else?

My hobby is reading
English novels.

Who's your favorite author?

John Steinbeck.

Yeah, he's a great writer.

How did you end up
learning English?

During medical school,

I studied English
in my spare time.

You're a doctor.

Kind of.

I work in a clinic.

In a culture revolution,

I was sent down
to the countryside,

and I raised pigs.

Two years wasted.

So after that,

I decided to make up for it.

What are you doing here?

I teach English here.

I wanted to come to China
since I was 12 years old.

More people speak Chinese
than any language in the world,

which I'm sure you know,

but I just kept thinking
how great it would be

to be able to talk
to a quarter of mankind,

one or two at a time, of course.

I think a lot of Americans
hope they'll find something

in China
they can't find at home.

And that was my idea
anyway.

Do you live nearby?

No, I live far away.

I have to catch the bus
before it's too late.

I'll walk you
to the bus stop.

It's on my way home.

No, you can't do that.

Good-bye.

See you later.

Hey.

What are you doing Sunday?

I'm going to the free market.

What's a free market?

Come and see.

I didn't know
you did Tai Chi.

This is just my hobby.

We have a saying here --

that a scholar should be
familiar with the literary

and the martial.
It makes for a good balance.

Could you teach me
that routine?

I'm not good enough.

If you want
to learn something,

you should always find
the best teacher.

There is a very famous Wushu
teacher here, Teacher Pan.

Yeah, I've met him.

I even asked him
to teach me.

You know what he said?

That's what I get for having
blue eyes and a big nose.

Do I look ugly to you?

No, not ugly.

Your face is very...

three-dimensional.

Be persistent.

I think you can convince him.

[bell rings]



what Teacher Pan

would show me first.

I'd always loved
the double saber

in Five Fingers of Death

and the nine section whip
in Shaolin Temple.

And how about those moves
Bruce Lee did in Fists of Fury?

than any movie.

This was for real.


My first lesson.

No whips, no sabers,
just staring.

[rock and roll music playing
on radio]

[music stops]

How much?

About $100, U.S.

Too much.

[speaking indistinctly]

These are dumplings.

Thank you.

Yeah.

I'd give anything

for a hot fudge sundae
right now.

Sunday?
This is Sunday.

about everything.

I don't remember
what we said.

I just remember her eyes,
her face,

the sound of her voice.

Okay, last week I asked you
to write a short essay--

"My happiest moment."

Let's start.

How about Teacher Zhang?

I'm a sad person.

I cannot remember
happy moment.

"I was assigned to teach here
in Hangzhou,

"far from home.

"I tried
to convince the leaders

"to let me stay
with my family,

"but it was impossible.

"I must go
where the Party sends me.

"Several years ago
my college gave me permission

"to visit my family.

"When the train arrived
in my hometown.

"My whole family was
at the station to meet me.

"I had so much
to tell them,

"but when I saw them,

"no words came out
of my mouth.

"I only stood there.

"Tears fell out
of my eyes like rain."

That was a beautiful essay.

Thank you.

Teacher Cai.

"My happiest moment --

"when I was a young man,

"I attended a dance at night.

"The music was being played,

"and the stars shone brightly.

"I saw a girl standing.

"I wanted to ask her
to dance,

"but as I'm a shy man,

"I did not dare.

"Then, I did.

"And we danced,

"my cheek touching hers.

"The room disappeared.

"The other people disappeared,

"and I could only see
the stars dancing.

"After that,

"I did not see her
ever again.

"I wonder where she is."

Teacher Cai, have you shown
this essay to your wife?

Yes, but it doesn't matter.

She cannot read English.

Teacher Xu.

My story's very common

'cause I'm a common man.

Last winter
I traveled to Peking.

My relatives there invited me
to a restaurant

famous for its Peking Duck.

First, we ate cold dishes,

such as marinated pig stomach

and sea slugs.

Then at last,
the duck arrived.

The skin was brown
and crisp and shiny.

In my mouth,
it was like clouds disappearing.

[Teacher Xu] I must confess
something, Teacher Mark.

What's that?

This story's true,

but actually,
I've never been to Peking.

My wife went to Peking
and had this duck.

And she often tells me
about it again, again.

I think even though
I was not there,

it is my happiest moment.

to start the class off

with something simple,

but I was learning that nothing
in China was simple,

especially something
like happiness.

[horn honks]

Hey, Ming.

What happened?

Oh, I got a perm?
How do you think?

Well,
it's really curly.

My parents hate it.

Yeah, well, that's parents
for you. What do they know?

I don't know
if I like it now.

Do you know this poem?


I think I know.

His house is
in the village, though.

He will not see me stopping
here to watch his woods

fill up with snow.

You wrote her name

by combining the characters
for the sun and the moon.

It meant brilliance
and enlightenment.

She was passionate
about literature.

She knew more English poetry
than I did.

She always said
what was on her mind.

It was as if
she had no time to lose.

[playing a medium-tempo tune]

Teacher Mark!
Teacher Mark!

Sinbad.

Sinbad,
what are you doing?

Come visit my family.

[baby cries]

[birds squawking]


anyone had invited me

to their home,
much less on a boat.

I was touched
by their generosity,

but it wasn’t until
what happened to me later

that I realized
the risk they took.

[playing medium-tempo tune]

[speaking Chinese]

[baby crying]

Why did you stop?

Do they want me
to play?

This is the way we enjoy music.

Sinbad, what are the two things

you think about most?

Eating and sleeping.

Come on. That can't be true.

It's true.

Our dormitory has terrible food,

and it is always noisy at night.

What about you?

What are your two things?

Well, I want
to be good at something,

like Teacher Pan.

The other thing is

I want people to like me,

especially girls.
You know what I mean?

But these things
are so easy.

All you have to do
is work hard

and be nice,

but eating and sleeping,

that's difficult

because we cannot control
these things.

You see?

I met some fishermen.

They invited me to live
with them on their boat.

You crazy boy.

How can you teach
if you live on a boat?

Did you do these?

No, my husband did.

He like to paint in ink,

but during the cultural
revolution,

he was put in prison

because these paintings are black.

I was sent
to a different camp

and couldn't see him,

but he wrote me letters.

After awhile, he stopped writing

They said he died of illness.

You're not wearing enough.

There's no heat in here.

Don't your parents
teach you how to keep warm?

I'm a big boy now.

How can you think
you understand everything?

You're so young,
so far away from home.

I'm your teacher.

If I don't care for you,
won't you be lonely?

[medium-tempo Chinese tune
playing]

[cymbals crashing]

[woman singing]

Can you understand
the words?

No, but it's fantastic anyway.

The lady in white
is really a snake spirit.

She falls in love
with a human,

but he abandons her.

Her attendant in green

wants to kill him.

[singing continues]

But the white snake
loves him so much

she's protecting him.

Doesn't he love her, too?

Yes, but she's a spirit.

So they can never
be together.

[speaking indistinctly]

But I like the last move
that she does.

We have to be very careful.

What if someone sees us?

So? That's our business.

In China, it's everybody's business.

I've already been criticized
for liking Western things.

What's wrong with Western things?

I thought that was
all right in China now.

It's not as free as it seems.

I live in a very different
world from yours.

But our worlds are getting closer.

Don't you think?

No. I can't.

I just can't do what I want,

like you.

Together we shall practice...

[speaking indistinctly]

Right. April,

why did the peasant
go to the factory?

He said together we shall
practice.


This book is really boring.

[speaks Chinese]

Let's do free talk.

Talk about anything you want.

Teacher Mark, I saw
the movieTess last week.

Did you like it?

No, I didn't enjoy it much

because of the stars
not beautiful.

You can't be serious.
Nastassja Kinski?

She's gorgeous.

Her lips are too big.

They're not too big.
They're full.

Then they're too full.

A woman's lips should be like a bug,

small and delicate.

Westerners think that
full lips are very good.

Good for what?

For kissing.


[Fatty Du]
Naughty boy!

What's the matter?
Don't people kiss here?

Of course not.

Here in China, it's quite
different from your country.

People don't kiss here.

[bell rings]

Teacher Mark,

you are honest my teacher,

so I must be an honest,
your student.

As to kissing,

this is not always true.

I have two daughters.

One is 12. One is 10.

I cannot kiss them

because they would feel
embarrassment

and call me foolish.

But every night
after they are asleep,

I kiss them good night,
very quiet, very soft,

and they don't know.

rarely revealed themselves

in front of others,
but they sought me out alone

to tell me
what they really thought.

I was teaching them
the rules of grammar,

but they were teaching me
about their lives.


all sorts of fancy moves.

It felt great!

I could almost hear the theme
music from Rocky playing

in the background,
but as soon as I thought

I was looking good,

Teacher Pan said that I was
just waving my arms around

and jumping up and down.

"You should look
like a mad tiger

"crashing down a mountain",
he growled.

"Do every movement
as if it were your last."


"Don't worry,

"it's just a broken arm."

"Don't worry,

"it's just a broken arm."

"Don't worry,

"it'’’s just a broken arm."

Where were you, Ming?
I waited all day.

It's been very busy at work.

Is something wrong?

The night we stayed out,

they needed me at the clinic.

My supervisor was very angry.

I'm sorry.

It's not your fault.

Who are you reading?

Oh, Jack London.

You know, I got into a lot
of trouble

because of these books.

I went to a medical school
to become a doctor,

but the leaders
of my college thought

I spent too much time
reading English novels.

They criticized me
for worshipping Western things.

So they punished me
by making me a counselor

in a family planning clinic.

What is this?

It's a collection
of American short stories.

I just got it.

For me?

For you.

Thank you.

Wait.

[clears throat]

What are doing?

Building up a friendship
between our two countries.

What would happen
if anyone saw you?

Well, you saw me.

What's the hell's wrong anyway?

Why is it so bad that
I want to get to know her?

Don't be a fool.
It's not bad for you,

but it's bad for her.

Ten years ago in this country,

she could have been kill
ed because of knowing you.

Don't you know that?

But that was ten years ago.

What does that have to do
with now?

My brother was killed
in Korea by Americans.

I know you had nothing
to do with it,

but not everybody here
feels the same way.

What will happen to her
when you leave China?

You've given us a very good
impression of your country.

Don't spoil it.

The political situation is changing.

You must be very careful.

[Mark's voice]
The student obeys the teacher.

Student.

The teacher cultivates
the student.

Teacher.


but I couldn't even get
a message to him.

I was afraid he'd think
I decided not to come anymore

and that he was right
about me,

that I couldn't eat bitter.

[door opens]

What are you doing here?

I have to talk to you
about something.

What happened to your hair?

My father cut it.

Why?

Because he knows you cut it.

He doesn't want me
to get in trouble.

I cannot see you anymore.

Don't do this, Ming.

Don't you see? You're a foreigner.

When your job is over,
you will leave China.

You yourself said
you could never stay here,

and I cannot leave.

My family needs me.

Teacher Mark!
Teacher Mark!

Mr. Sung wants to see you
in the Foreign Affairs Office

right now.

What is it now?

What is this of your
tearing down the school?

It was an accident.
I bumped into the wall.

I warned you.
Now I must tell you --

according to the Chinese regulations,

a foreigner who destroys property

will be punished by the Chinese law.

Understand?

You should be using
the past tense by now.

Teacher Ju, can you explain
this picture for me?

Yes, that's a picture
of an atom bomb, isn't it?


Teacher Mark,
how you feeling

when you know that your country
dropped an atom bomb

on innocent people?

We say, "How do you feel knowing?"

Not "how are you feeling?"

How do you feel?

In America, not everyone thinks

it was the right thing to do,

but most people think it saved lives.

How did it save lives?

Well, by ending the war
more quickly.

But, Teacher Mark,

it is a fact that the Japanese
had already surrendered

to the Communist Army in China.

America put a bomb in Japan in order

to make the world think
that America was the...

The victor.

Oh, yes, the victor.

Teacher Ju, how do
you know this is a fact?

That's what our newspapers say.

But our newspapers
tell a different story,

you see?

How do we know which newspaper
has told the truth?

This is easy.

Our newspapers are controlled
by the people,

but your newspapers

are owned by capitalists to make money.

So of course,
they make things up.

Don't you think so?

It doesn't matter.

Any capitalist country would do that.

It is not just your country.

was like playing a game

where the rules kept changing.

China needed foreigners like me
to come teach English,

but the officials would have
preferred to tie me to my desk

between classes rather than
risk letting me loose

to spread bourgeois ideas.

First, Ming was off-limits to me,

and now teacher Pan,
whose martial arts skills

were suddenly considered
national defense secrets.

After almost a year in China,

Teacher Hei was the only one left

who could still talk to me.

If you like,
you can practice with me.

I'll try to help you if I can.

Come on.
You can learn some Tai Chi.

Tai Chi is based on yin and yang,

the theory of opposites.

When you tap me here,

on this side,

I push you on exactly
the opposite side.

Here. Give it a try.

What's the matter?

I give up.

You've only started.

No, no, it's not this.

It's this whole foreigner thing.

I can't deal with this anymore.

I don't want
to be a foreign devil,

big nose...
[speaks Chinese]

I didn't come here for that.

I'm just a person, like them.

Mark, come with me.

You know, the Buddha
was an Indian prince.

He was a foreigner,

but we made Buddhism our own.

You are a foreigner.

It's true,

but you can make
Wushu your own.

Sue me. Sue me.

a real Chinese problem,

and I was going to need
a Chinese solution.

I found a warehouse on campus

where the Foreign Affairs people

would never think to look for us.

One of the art students
loaned me the key

in exchange
for my shortwave radio,

so he and his friends could
listen to the Voice of America.

it was so hard

to get him to teach me,
and I couldn't understand why.

Now he was defying the authorities

to teach me a weapon
he'd never taught anyone else,

and I still couldn't understand.

Why did this mean so much to him?

I like martial arts

very much.

Don't worry.

It's just a shoulder dislocation.

May I introduce myself?

My name's Pan Qingfu.

Pan is the surname.

Qingfu is the first name.

Do you understand?

Yeah.

had no phone,

I just had to wait
for him to show up.

Sometimes he'd disappear
for weeks at a time,

and I'd go crazy,

thinking maybe he'd decided
I wasn't worth teaching.

Then all of a sudden, he'd find
a way to appear again,

teach me something new

and insist that it'd
be perfect the next time.

said that about losing face,

I realized the extent
of my responsibility to him,

and it was scary,
but also wonderful,

because I began
to feel it wasn't just me

pushing myself anymore,

but also him
pulling me along from inside.

I don't understand.

In China, some teacher
s are old-fashioned.

If you study with other teachers

without asking their permission,

they think you don't respect them.

Would it help
if you talked to him for me?

Whoever ties a knot has to untie it.

You should talk to him yourself.

of working out

and trying so hard,

I'd managed to offend the one man

I wanted to please the most.

How could I get a man who said
he never made mistakes

to change his mind about me?

How could I change his iron mind?


that it was all going
to end like this,

but I did do one thing right.

The students' English improved.

I even taught them a few songs.

There were always getting them
mixed up, though.

On my birthday,
they sang Silent Night.

Teacher Mark!
Teacher Mark!

Someone important wants
to see you.

I'm busy packing.
Why don't you give me a hand?

I can help you later. Come.

[Teacher Xu playing Jingle Bells
on accordion]

# On a one-horse open sleigh

# Over the fields we go

# Laughing all the way

# Bells on bobtails ring

# Making spirits bright

# What fun it is to ride and sing

# A sleighing song tonight

[continue singing in Chinese ]


We fixed you your favorite
ice cream sundae.

Doctor Wang brought the ice cream.

Teacher Shi made the sesame sauce.

And I chopped the peanuts.

Oh, that's so nice.
I'd better try it.

Delicious.

The best I ever had.

[maracas playing]

[slow-tempo tune playing
on violin]

I can't believe you're here.

I had to see you one more time.

I have to go now.

Bye.

Get on.

Come on, Ming, live a little. Get on.

[horns honking]

What will you do, Ming?

I will read in my room and dream.

In my imagination, I'm free,

and I can do wonderful things.

I'm gonna miss you, you know?

Really?

Yeah.

You're different.

Your lectures
make everyone laugh.

You should always stay that way.

You're the one that's special.

You must know I love you.

I have to get back now.

At the bottom, I will get off.

So I will say good-bye now.

I'll take you all the way home.

No, at the end of the bridge,
I will get off.

I won't see you again,

so be good.

Now go as fast as you can.

Take that sword

back to America

and teach good students.

[Woman speaking Chinese
over loudspeaker]

You didn't have to come
all the way to the station.

You're leaving China.

I had to walk you part
of the way home.

You still don't wear enough.

I knitted this for you.

Show him.

[ripping sound]


Ow!

exactly how Teacher Hei looked

at that moment.

Teacher Pan

and Ming.

I couldn't concentrate
on the book I was reading.

It was America that suddenly
felt like some exotic dream,

and China that was real to me.

There was a saying that
it's the height of stupidity

to look for the donkey
that you're already riding on.

I had come halfway
around the world

looking for places that existed
mostly in my mind.

And while I didn't find
what I'd expected,

I did find that I was riding
on that donkey all along,

and that eating bitter
lets you taste sweet.
