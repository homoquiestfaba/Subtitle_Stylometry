Darlene: A dream come true?

It looks good.

Director: What the ... Are you kidding me?

Get out! Get out!

Darlene: Just do what he says.

Ginger: Yeah, I know. How many
years have I been doing this?

Darlene: I know, but ...

Jeffrey.

Jeff: It's the United
International Top Model Contest.

Darlene: This is Darlene.

Uh-huh.

O-oh, okay, thank you.

You're in! You're in the
Top Model Competition!

I'm so happy!

Director: Can we get
the model on set please!

Darlene: Go, go go!

You're in it too.

Director: Take your position
on the starting line.

Tilt your head up, breasts out. Smile.

Okay, you're running a race. Go.

Stop, stop! Look where you are.

Back at the starting line, and
this time, stay in your lane!

Head up, tuck your fanny in. Smile. Run!

Okay, and back to the top.

Yay.

Bring the right shoulder up a bit more.

Now look sultry.

Ginger: Aren't you glad
we moved to the beach?

Darlene: You have your
trainer this afternoon.

Where are you going?

Ginger: To the gym.

Darlene: On the skates?

Ginger: Mhm.

Darlene: You know if you
injure yourself you're going to

wreck your opportunity for
the Top Model competition.

Ginger: No.

Darlene: Darling, this is your big break.

I want you to do your best.

Ginger: I know, I will. I'll be careful.

I'm a big girl, I can take care of myself.

You've got to let me live, woman. Move.

Darlene: While I'm managing
you you'll do as I say.

Ginger: While I'm managing
you you'll do as I say.

Bye.

Man: legal, get high.

Ginger: Hi.

Madonna: I'm just about to start a show.

Ginger: Cool.

Madonna: Good morning.

Chaos: Hey, hello hello.

You need help with your plumbing?

Ginger: No.

You're in for a treat,
Madonna is one of the best.

Madonna: Oh, whatever.

Chaos: Oh, touchy. I guess I better

let you get on with it then.

My name's Chaos.

Ginger: Ginger.

Madonna: Ginger, if you
could just take a couple

steps back you can help me build a crowd.

Ginger: Over ...

Madonna: Yep, just take a
couple steps back right there.

Madonna: Hello everyone.

I'm Madonna, and I'm
about to start a show.

For the start I'm just going
to need two volunteers.

Only two, I know it's early
in our relationship to ask.

I'm going to need a man,
and a woman. Anyone?

You there, come over
here! Come on, come on!

Stand. Oh my!

Let's give a hand for our
first volunteer, shall we?

Fabulous!

Let's see. And maybe we can get

a man with the lady.

Maybe a man- There you are!

Oh, he's fabulous.

Just for a minute, it
will be a lot of fun.

Ah, give it up for our second volunteer!

Come on, come on. Bravo.

I'm going to give you a little bit of

costume because obviously
this is not enough.

Here, and here.

Take this, now let's put this on.

Come on, give them a hand, help them out.

They're doing a great job!

He looks like he's never
put on a tutu before.

Let's go, let's go, let's go.

My ballerinas, they're fabulous.

Oh yes, don't they look wonderful?

Now can get get a little bit of a dance?

Just a spin, just a spin.

Come on, a little spin.

Very nice.

Do you two know each other,
do you know each other?

No? Have you ever met this
man before in your life?

I want you to give each other
a little high five, can we?

High five.

Yes, yes! Now a little handshake, maybe?

A little handshake? Come on.

Yes, fabulous, fabulous!

Maybe just a little
hug, just a little hug.

Woman: I don't think so.
Sorry, we're not doing that.

Sorry about that. I'm sorry.

Madonna: Oh no. Well that's not-

That's not going to work.

Thank you all so much for your time,

you've been a wonderful audience.

My name's Madonna, that's
my show for the day.

I want to start again when
we get a bit more people.

If you'd like to show your appreciation

you can drop a coin in the hat.

Oh, thank you.

Chaos: I just want to
say-

Hey sexy.

Madonna: Oh, hey. You still alive?

Just barely.

What's up brother?

Chaos: Crazy as usual.

Madonna: Oh, thank you.

I don't know what's going on with my show.

Chaos: Well you've got it on video

so you can see what went wrong.

Madonna: I know what went wrong.

Chaos: All right, it's
not the end of the world.

It was just an unfortunate
choice of volunteer.

Not you, you were fine.

You made the right choice to bail.

I don't know, maybe.

I feel like you could
have rescued that one.

Madonna: Well sure, but
then I would have had

less audience and less money in the hat.

You don't know that.

But that's normally what happens

because you're stuck in your routine.

Madonna: Maybe you're right.

Of course I'm right.

Madonna: Next time I need
to take my time and play

with the audience more
before I pick a volunteer.

All right, who's up?

Chaos: It's me, I'm up. It's me.

Can I borrow your camera?

Madonna: Ooh, yeah.

Chaos: Yes, thank you.

Yes, this is a show, and I'm
going to be starting just

as soon as I finish setting
my stage and warm up.

Madonna: How are you? I
haven't seen you in a while.

I just did Paris for the first time.

Madonna: I know! How was it?

Are you kidding? It was
fantastic, it's awesome.

I've got my show really working out.

Madonna: Nice.

Ginger: That's really funny.

You guys are pretty lucky,

just traveling around
the world, having fun.

Madonna: Well you could too,
there's nothing stopping you.

Ginger: No, I could never do that.

Madonna: Why?

Ginger: I'm just not that kind of person.

Madonna: I wasn't that
kind of person either.

Ginger: I don't have a show.

Madonna: You just start, and
you learn as you go along.

Want to know the
secret of how to do it?

Just let it be easy.

Ginger: There has to be a
little more to it than that.

Nope. It's all about
surrendering to the flow,

and building up to a climax.

Madonna: He always uses the same line.

Ginger: Um. Thank you for the explanation.

But I don't think I'm any the wiser.

Madonna: We're always learning.

I mean, you saw my last show.

You can't wait until you
know everything to start.

Or you can take workshops.

Chaos does an evening class.

You don't need workshops.

Madonna: Keep it, it looks good on you.

Oh-hoh, fail.

Chaos: Here's your camera.

Madonna: Thank you.

Chaos: Thank you.
Madonna: No, thank you.

Chaos: Okay.

Madonna: I'm going to get some coffee.

Does anybody need anything?

Chaos: Oh, yes. Get me a water please.

Madonna: Thank you.

Ginger: That was great,
you were really funny.

Very inspiring.

She's a clown convert.

Chaos: That simple, is it?

I bet you think clowns all
about making people laugh.

Ginger: Yes.

Chaos: What's the
difference from comedy then?

Comedy's about being real, in the moment,

without all the pretenses we
normally defend ourselves with.

That guy, for example, the one that got

dragged out of Madonna's
show by his girlfriend?

They shared some intimate
information about themselves and

their relationship, which people
can relate to, so they laugh.

But that laughter is just footprints

in the sand, after, like spirits.

Ginger: You're deep.

Chaos: As a clown you don't
just learn about yourself,

you learn about all the
other people in the world.

And you know something?
They're all different.

Billions of them, all different,

all busy trying to tell
their story, if you listen.

Ginger: You don't think I'm listening?

Chaos: I don't even think
you're listening to yourself.

Ginger: TC said to just let it be easy.

You make me terrified of even trying it.

Chaos:.

Clown. Here you are,
being real in the moment.

Is that something you normally do?

Ginger: I try to.

Sometimes I do.

You know, most of the time.

You know what? You don't
even know anything about me.

Chaos: I'd say you still live at home.

Probably just your mother.
She's your overbearing side.

You work occasionally,
probably as a model.

You have in your room.

And you're desperately
seeking a real relationship.

Ginger: No.

Chaos: What part isn't true?

Ginger: I'm not desperately
seeking anything.

Chaos: Now that's the part I know is true.

Ginger: How?

Chaos: Because here you are,

having an intimate conversation
with a complete stranger.

Madonna: Hey, take it easy on her.

She's thinking about
taking your workshops.

Chaos: Oh, well that's a
complete different story.

In that case, you'd of course

be most welcome.

Darlene: Good, you're home.

How did it go?

Ginger: Very refreshing.

Darlene: You need to change,
we have that sponsorship party.

Ginger: I have a class I want to go to.

Darlene: I'm sorry, we have to go.

Ginger: I hate those things.

Can't drink, I don't know
anyone, and they're always old.

Darlene: Well I need you.
You're the one they sponsor.

Ginger: It's not like I see
any of that money anyway.

Darlene: You know it goes into
a trust. You get an allowance.

Jeffrey will be by in a few minutes.

Ginger: Jeffrey. Why do you always

hire these young men assistants?

Darlene: I do it for you.

Ginger: For me?

Darlene: Mhm.

You find Jeffrey attractive don't you?

Ginger: Mom!

Darlene: Oh come on,
you've got to start dating.

We took a vow of chastity but it doesn't

mean we can't go out and have any fun.

Ginger: Oh my God.

Chaos: Okay no hands, no hands.

You're late, and a little overdressed.

Ginger: Oh, yeah.

I had to go to one of my
sponsor's parties, sorry.

Chaos: Well, it's a hard
life for some of us.

Ginger: Actually very boring.

Chaos: Do you have anything
else you can change into?

Ginger: Yeah.

Chaos: Okay.

Um, Clara.

Clara that was very good.

Class this is Ginger. Ginger, class.

I'm not going to lie, since
you came in late you're

going to kind of have to
jump into the unknown.

Your structure is move abnormally,

and touch the object on
stage with your body.

And you don't know what it is.

Ginger: It's a head of lettuce.

Chaos: No, you don't know what it is.

Ginger: I'm sorry, I have no
idea what you want me to do.

Chaos: Perfect, up you go.

Ginger: No, I don't know what I'm doing.

Chaos: So go find out.

Trust it will happen.

Move in abnormal movements.

Let us know how you feel by using sounds.

Ginger: Ugh!

Chaos: No hands.

Ladies and gentleman, a big
round of applause for her.

That was really good. Thank you.

Thank you.

Welcome back.

Ginger: I feel really good now.

Chaos: That's good.

Woman: Hey, you had
some really lovely work.

I mean, you're thinking too much but once

you got off there you're a joy to watch.

Ginger: Thanks, I think.

You know, I really actually
thought I knew what a clown was.

No idea, none.

Chaos: Excellent. You are now on your way.

Woman: See you next week.
Chaos: Take care.

Do you want to walk with
me along the ocean walk?

Dancer: Hey.

Chaos: Honey.

Honey this is Ginger, a new clown student.

Ginger: Nice to meet you.
Honey is a very nice name.

Dancer: My name's Dancer.

Only Chaos calls me Honey.

Chaos: We were just about
to explore the ocean walk.

Dancer: Anything for a
new clown student, right?

Especially a young, pretty female one.

Chaos: We'll just walk that
way back to your house.

Dancer: This will be fun.

Let's take you out to play.

Ginger: That was fun.

Chaos: Yeah, you were good, see?

You just need to let it go.

Look at this guy and his funny walk.

Ginger: You don't watch people normally.

Chaos: No, you don't
watch people normally.

Ginger: That's what I meant.

Chaos: I know.

Dancer: Lovely evening. Love your shirt.

Watch, he's going to
turn back and look at us.

Let's all wave.

Let's play the hello
game, it's nice and simple.

Chaos: We don't need to
play, we can just watch.

Dancer: But the clown
student wants to play.

That's why she's here, isn't it?

Ginger: I've had a big day already.

Dancer: That's the best time to
do it, when you're on a roll.

Chaos: She likes to
pretend that she's a tea-

Dancer: I've seen you do it.

Chaos: Exactly.

Dancer: The hello game
is all about attracting

attention and making contact with people.

Watch.

Hello ladies, hello! Oh-la-la-la-la.

See? It's as simple as that.

You have a go.

Try this family.

Chaos: You're doing it
wrong, she needs a nose.

Dancer: That's right.

Ginger: Hey!

Man: Hey.

Dancer: Well done.

You try that guy.

Ginger: Wait, which one?
Dancer: That guy.

Chaos: You okay?

That's why she's not a
teacher, she's a trickster.

You can learn a lot from
her if remember that.

Dancer: Come on, that was funny.

Chaos: I guess you've
had enough for today,

but it's best not to end that way.

You up for something else?

Let's try some mimicry.

Try him.

Ginger: I can't, it's rude.

Chaos: Why?

Ginger: We don't have permission.

Chaos: I give you permission.

Ginger: That's very nice, but he didn't.

Chaos: He'll never know,
he doesn't need to.

Dancer: You have to give yourself

permission, that's the secret.

Ginger: Just give myself permission.

Chaos: She's right. He'll never know.

It's just your own inhibitions.

Ginger: Great, it's just my inhibitions.

Chaos: Yes. Off you go.

Ginger: All right.
Chaos: That was awesome.

Dancer: Nice job.

Chaos: You want to try some
play like we did in class?

You see that tree?

That's your head of
lettuce. Go play with it.

Ginger: You want me to bury
myself with a palm tree?

Sorry.

You know, I'm good. I've
had enough, it's good.

Chaos: Okay, what if I do it with you.

Will that make it easier?

Ginger: Yeah.

Chaos: Can you take a video
so she can see it later?

Dancer: Give me your phone.

Ginger: Eh, down.

Oh my God!

Hey!

I didn't even realize
we had people watching.

Darlene: Well you look like
a couple of crazy people,

of course they're going to watch.

Ginger: You know, you have no idea

what a wonderful day I had yesterday.

Darlene: Were you on drugs?

Ginger: No, mom.

Darlene: Well I was at my
wit's end. I left you messages.

Ginger: My phone was off.

You're hovering, give me some space.

Darlene: I booked you a
lingerie shoot for tomorrow.

Ginger: I told you
I don't want to do those.

Darlene: I know, but as soon as you make

the Top Model competition
you won't have to.

Ginger: I think I want to be a clown.

Darlene: Well, that's
just not appropriate.

Think of my reputation.

Ginger: I bet you think clown is all

about making people laugh, don't you?

Darlene: It obviously doesn't
matter what I think, does it?

Ginger: Whatever.

Darlene: You have a
casting this afternoon.

It's with that new designer, he's good.

Ginger: Can't they just
do it from the photos?

Darlene: Oh no, no, no, no.

No, it's a fashion show.

Come on, you- you've got
to show how you move.

Ginger: That was really
good. Maybe you should do it.

Darlene: Maybe I should.

Ginger: Maybe you should.

Madonna: All right,.

Here we go, I could just
stay here all day, why not.

Good, that's perfect, I love it.

I bet you had no idea
you were going to get-

Taste it, taste it, oh my goodness!

And for the final act,
magical juggling madness.

Before you very eyes, as promised.

Yes!

That's it, thank you everyone.

Can you bend your knees?

That's your show today,
ladies and gentlemen.

If you appreciated it
at all you can show your

consideration by dropping
a dollar in the hat.

Thank you so much, green for green.

Ginger: Hey.

Chaos: Hey.

Ginger: Hey, thanks again for yesterday.

When I showed the video to
my mom she was horrified.

Chaos: Let's have a look.

Ginger: Hey, how was that?

Madonna: I am stuck in a time warp.

Ginger: Looked like a lot
of your crowd walked away.

Madonna: I'm running on
autopilot and they can feel it.

Ginger: Well, I can't feel it.

Madonna: Well I'm just a
washed up street clown,

so what do I know?

What are you guys doing?

Chaos: Watching this improv that
Ginger and I did last night.

Madonna: Oh, well done.

I told you.

Ginger: Well I couldn't
have done it without Chaos.

Chaos: It's true.

I had to tell her to do it,
or do it with her, every time.

Madonna: Well that will
be your next challenge,

to do it on your own.

Ginger: On my own?

Chaos: Well you don't have to.

Madonna: We'll help you.

All you need is a simple structure.

Big night last night?

Chaos: Yeah, Dancer and
I did a lot of talking.

Ginger: Yeah, where is she?

Chaos: She makes more money at other gigs

so she only comes here when she has to.

Ginger: She seems ...

Madonna: Uptight? Competitive? Jealous?

Possessive in a kind of
non-possesive possesive kind of way?

Chaos: Dancer and I have
an open relationship.

Madonna: How is that going for you?

Chaos: I know it's mainly so she

can sleep around when she's touring.

And now she's getting suspicious

of the students when she's here.

Ginger: Why? Do you normally have

relationships with students?

Chaos: Never.

Ginger: Never?

Chaos: That's not what we're doing here.

Ginger: No, I- Of course,
that's not what I meant.

Besides, you have that wonderful
relationship with Dancer.

Chaos: Okay, now that we
all know about my love life.

What about yours?

Ginger: Well in my family we ...

believe in abstinence until marriage.

Madonna: Hey.

Hey.

Who's working?

Chaos: It's me.

Madonna: I think the
first thing we should do,

take you shopping for
some performance clothes.

Ginger: Okay, can you mind my stuff?

Madonna: Come on.

Ginger: Ew, dusty.

Madonna: Yes, of course they are.

Try these on.

Mhm.

This.

Hi!

Ginger: Hey!

Madonna: Howdy! Howdy ma'am.

What do you think?

Ginger: Oh, I love it, but I have

to say it's a little uncomfortable.

Madonna:
Let's find something else.

What do you think?

Ginger: It kind of feels like me.

I don't know, do you
think it's too obvious?

Madonna: No, that's
good, that's the point.

You can even do your
rollerblading in your show.

You don't have to wear
it, it's just so you

can collect money at the end of your show.

What are we going to do with this?

Ginger: Why, what's wrong with it?

Madonna: It's just a little normal.

Ginger: Well, I have my regular

appointment with my stylist tomorrow.

Madonna: Think about it.

Ginger: I like it.

Madonna: Hey, shouldn't buy one of these?

Ginger: I have never tried.

Madonna: It will be a lot better than your

rollerblades because
you can hop on and off.

Ginger: This one kind
of matches my clothes.

Madonna: Oh, yeah!

Ginger: Oh yeah.

Hi papi. Okay, okay, okay!

Chaos: I see you've been
doing a clown makeover.

Madonna: She came up good, huh?

Chaos: You know any tricks on that?

I can teach you.

Ginger: Thanks.

What am I going to do for
the rest of it though?

I mean, the skateboarding is
just the last couple of minutes.

What do I do for the rest of the show?

Chaos: Well, start with what you like.

What did you like most about yesterday?

Ginger: Teasing the men?

Chaos: Teasing the men. Teasing the men.

Ginger: Well like, I
remember this one guy,

and he didn't even see me
until he bumped into me.

He turned around and apologized,
but he had on this tight

t-shirt and his nipples poked
out, so I kind of tweaked them.

I don't know why!

It seemed appropriate at the time.

Madonna: What did he do?

Ginger: He just laughed.

Chaos: That's a good
approach for your show.

Take the men on stage,
then push the boundaries.

Madonna: And the rest is straight
street theater structure.

First you attract attention.

Chaos: Then build the audience.

Madonna: Then you make friends,

because you're going to need them.

Chaos: Organize your audience, and then

start playing some crowd-building games.

Madonna: Then you introduce
yourself and start your show.

Chaos: Drag your volunteers on

stage and, play with their nipples.

Pass the hat around.

Madonna: Nice.

Ginger: But how am I going to do all that?

Okay, okay, okay. Give me the list again?

Madonna: First attract an audience ...

Ginger: What if I can't do it?

Chaos: No, you can do it.

I mean, you know how to skate
so you'll pick it up quickly.

Ginger: Show me how.

Chaos: Okay.

Ginger: Just do it.

Pretty good.

Chaos: I'm just playing. You have a go.

Ginger: So put my foot, like right here?

Chaos: Yes.

Ginger: Okay, then?

Chaos: Keep that there and then push.

Ginger: Woo!

Chaos: Turn.

Ginger: Turn where?

Chaos: Your feet.

Ginger: No, no, no, no.

Chaos: Again!

Ginger:
how do you stop this thing?

Chaos: I haven't figured that out-

I'm playing, I'm playing.

Ginger: I hate you.

Chaos: If I jump that box, how
about you do the show with me?

Ginger: That's a deal.

Chaos: Deal.

Ginger: That box right there?

Chaos: That box right there.

Ginger: Any day now.

Chaos: Clown down.

Ginger: Give me that.

I have to go. I'm late for a fitting.

Chaos: Oh no you don't.

You don't get out of
doing a show that easy.

Ginger: No, I really have to go.

Chaos: Uh-uh.
Ginger: Give me that!

I'll be right back. I'll
be right- I promise.

Chaos: Okay.

Ginger: Hi.

Woman: Thank you for coming in.

Jamie, this is Ginger.

Ginger: Sorry about the clothes,
I was at a costume event.

Jamie: Do we have her measurements?

Woman: Mhm.

Oh, we'll let you know.

So Veronica, somewhere
in the middle, right?

Jamie: Might be somewhere in the middle.

We can't close with Veronica.
She has a horse face.

Madonna: I left the amp on for you

so you can plug in your music.

Ginger: Maybe I can't-

Maybe I'm not ready to do this today.

Madonna: You're never really
ready, it's a work in progress.

At least after you do it
you'll have learned something.

Ginger: Yeah, that I can't do it.

Madonna: Well, if you think like that,

that's exactly what you're going to get.

Ginger: You think your show's
a problem all the time.

Madonna: Because it is.

Chaos: You know, she's right.

Maybe if you thought about it differently,

your show would work out.

Madonna: Well I'm just a
washed-up street clown,

what do I know?

Chaos: You see how you're
always putting yourself down?

Madonna: It's a joke!

Chaos: Yeah, that's in
danger of becoming true.

Madonna: All right! Okay!

Ginger: Hi!

Man: Hey.

Ginger: Hello, how are you?

Hi guy, how are you?

Woo!

Hello.

I like you guys.

Oh sir, are you okay?

Bye!

Do you guys want to see a trick?

Come stand right here.

Do you want to hold my?

Wait one second.

Chaos: Oh my God, are you okay?

Ginger: I have a shoot tomorrow.

Chaos: Good thing you're
wearing those kneepads.

Ginger: You have no idea how many

problems this is going to cause.

Chaos: It'll heal quickly, it's okay.

Ginger: I told you I wasn't ready.

Chaos: Yeah, and you proved it.

Ginger: Thanks a lot.

Darlene: Ginger? Good.

Can you help me with
these groceries please?

What are you wearing?

Ginger: The clowns gave me a makeover.

Darlene: I told you I didn't
want you hanging out with them.

Ginger: Don't worry, it's
not going to happen again.

Um, I'm sorry, I fell and
bruised my leg yesterday

so maybe this isn't the best day for this.

Man: Show me.

Show me.

What have you done with your leg?

Ginger: I told you I fell.

Man: Well that's not going to work, is it.

Shame.

Is your mother here?

Darlene: You know what, you don't know

how lucky you are to have her.

This is the last time we do one

of these, especially with you.

See how I stick up for you?

Ginger: You're supposed to.

But, thank you.

Darlene: What's the story?

Oh my God.

Why didn't you tell me?

Ginger: I thought it would heal.

Darlene: Geeze, what happened?

Ginger: I fell.

Darlene: Oh you stupid
girl, you stupid girl!

You promised me you would
protect yourself, you promised!

You know what, we are just going to

go right now and get your hair done.

Ginger: Stop treating me like a child.

Darlene: Stop acting like one.

Stylist: So, same as usual?

Wash, trim and straighten?

Ginger: Actually I thought I would do

something a little more drastic this time.

Maybe something like this.

Stylist: I don't think your
mother would like that.

Ginger: Yeah, I know.

But it's my hair.

Madonna: Hey, nice hair!

How is our little clown today?

Ginger: I'm fine.

All right, I can't do it. Is
that what you want to hear?

Madonna: Hey, that's not true.

You had some really great moments.

Ginger: When?

Madonna: The lying on the ground,

and stopping people with the whistle.

That was good.

Dancer: You just got
confused with your structure.

It happens to everyone.
I mean, look at Chaos.

Ginger: Yeah, what's he doing?

Dancer: He's dying out there.

Ginger: Why isn't it working?

Dancer: He's just, not so good.

Ginger: But he is, he's great. He's ...

so original and creative.

Dancer: Aww, the clown
student loves her teacher.

Madonna: It happens to everyone.

Dancer: Him, more than most.

Madonna: I don't know about that.

Dancer: Invariably when I'm here.

Chaos: Woo.

Dancer: Well, the only good thing we can

say about that is you bailed early.

You want to meet me tomorrow afternoon?

I've got a proposal.

Chaos: Okay.

My stuff never works when
she's around. She's a jinx.

Madonna: It's emotional.

You try way too hard when she's around.

You play it safe rather than
push any of your boundaries.

Chaos: Oh, and you can talk?

Madonna: I'm just saying, just saying.

Chaos: Great hair.

Ginger: Sorry, it's
just ... trying to work

out what to do in my show so I don't fail.

Madonna: Hey, failure is good.

We learn so much more from our

failures than we do our successes.

Chaos: And we often tell others
what we need to do ourselves.

Madonna: You.

Chaos: The secret is,
don't be afraid of failure,

just push your own boundaries.

Ginger: I feel like I did that though.

Chaos: Well as you can
see, we need to keep at it.

Look at her.

She always does this,
she likes to show me up.

Ginger: Oh my God, that's so aggressive.

Chaos: It's just water.

Ginger: Yeah but it's-

It's an invasion of our personal space.

Chaos: That sounds like a
good definition of a clown.

Woman: He's shooting water at me!

Chaos:.

Ginger: Sorry.

Darlene: Gosh, you scared me.

Ginger: Mama, how much
have you had to drink?

Darlene: Don't tell me what to do.

What are you wearing on your-

What are you wearing
on your head?

Ginger: It's my new hat.

You like it?

Darlene: No.

Ginger: Okay.

You have a good night.

Darlene: Night.

Ginger: All the top models are doing it.

Darlene: They booked you
for that job, by the way.

Ginger: I wanted to stand
out in the Top Model heat.

Darlene: There's a fitting today at 2:00.

Ginger: Uh, okay. I was going to

go to the gym but I'll be there.

Darlene: I have to go. I love you.

Chaos: That is a lovely melon you have.

Now the moment you've
all been waiting for.

Come in closer, a little closer.

Give me your energy, I feel it. Yes sir.

I need a big countdown from 10

nine, eight, seven,

six, five, four, three, two, one.

Woo-hoo!

You've all been a wonderful crowd.

Right before your very
eyes, a modern day clown.

Now is the time when I must take

the most important part of my show.

If work here is has caused
you ,

which judging by the clapping and

the wonderful countdown, it has.

Now is the time to give back.

Oh, we're not smiling anymore.

Remember, the more you
give the more fun I have.

You've been beautiful and a great crowd.

My name is Chaos. This is my heart.

And this ... is my hat.

Ginger: That was great.
You just kept pushing it.

Chaos: Madonna's right,
that's my strength.

Ginger: Do you need help?

Chaos: Yeah.

Madonna: Nice work!

Hey lady.

Ginger: All right guys,
how far can you go?

Chaos: As far as you want.

Madonna: You have to
really want to go there.

Chaos: Yeah, you can't be thinking

about it as you're doing it.

Ginger: I am always doing that.

Chaos: With clown or with life?

Ginger: Both.

But I'm starting to see
you can pretty much do

anything if you just
completely commit to it.

Madonna: You know, I think you should push

the envelope with your show a bit more.

Be a little more vulgar.

Absolutely.

Ginger: Go away.

Madonna: Breaking taboos is
all about releasing tension.

Taboos about playing with food.

Taboos about sex.

Watch this.

Come to momma, come to momma!

Give it a try!

Ginger: No, not him!

Madonna: With Chaos then.

Come on!

Ginger: Okay.

Madonna: Oh, look at him.

Look at him.

Ginger: Don't get any ideas from that.

Chaos: Of course not.

Shall I give you some games to play?

Put your nose on.

See all this litter on the street?

I want you to pick it up
and give it to people.

Ginger: I'm not going to give
it to people, it's dirty.

Chaos: Oh! I'm trying to help you here

and you keep working against me.

Ginger: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Chaos: Stop apologizing.

Now when I tell you to pick up
litter and give it to people,

and you feel something, don't
stop and talk to me about it.

Ginger: But-
Chaos: Let your feelings work

for you by expressing them in character.

I couldn't make a mess!

Ginger: I don't want to make a mess!

Chaos: Yes.

Now say it as you give it away.

Ginger: I don't want to make a mess.

I don't want to make a mess.

I don't want- I don't-

Oh. I don't want to make a mess.

Man: We're okay, thank you.

Ginger: I don't want to make a mess. Oh.

I don't want to make a mess. Ew.

I don't want to make a mess.

Man: Thank you.

Ginger: I don't want to make a mess.

Woman: No thank you.

Okay, I'll take it. Thank you.

Ginger: I don't want to make a mess.

Dancer: I see you brought your new puppet.

Chaos: She's doing good,
in a kind of bumbly way.

Dancer: Why do you have
your microphone on?

Chaos: I just finished doing a show.

Dancer: Sure.

I think we need to get serious
about our relationship.

I've been offered a part in
the new Ringling Brothers show.

It's part of a duo.

They asked me who I want to work with

and I'm thinking of suggesting you.

Chaos: Wow.

Dancer: Wow?

Ginger: Oh my God, that was so much fun.

Give me another one.

Chaos: I've noticed you're
inhibited about using your voice.

So I want you to ask the
people what time it is

in a funny voice.

Ginger: But
I would never do that.

Chaos: Of course not.

Off you go.

Dancer: You really care about her.

Chaos: I like to see
all my students growing.

Dancer: You really care about her.

Look, think about the
Ringling Brothers thing.

And if we do it I think we need to

formalize our relationship.

Just think about it.

Ginger: Do you have-a the time?

Man: What time?

Ginger: The time, you know,
the time on the watch.

The thing. Oh yeah.

You are a very good man.
I love your sweater.

Chaos: I think the next step is to do

a guest spot on my show.

Ginger: A guest spot.

Chaos: Yeah, so you don't have
to do all the crowd building.

Ginger: Okay.

Chaos: Now.

Ginger: I have a fitting in an hour.

But it should only take
half an hour or so?

Chaos: Deal.

Ginger: Okay, okay. I'll be back.

Jamie: My God, your hair.

It wasn't like that the other day was it?

I actually like it.

But whether it will work for
this showing we'll have to see.

Get going, I need you
to start with Ginger.

Try the mint.

It doesn't go with the hair.

Try the pink and black.

This is okay. This I don't-

You need to go get a tan or something.

Move.

Okay.

I don't want you playing
that character on the show.

But that outfit will work.

Photograph her and bag it.

Ginger: Hey.

Chaos: I was beginning to give up.

Ginger: Sorry, it took
longer than I thought.

I was thinking about
the play this morning.

Actually quite liberating just playing

with your own personal hangups.

Madonna: No!
Ginger: Hey.

Chaos: Well that's good because now you're

going to do a make-a-mess show.

Ginger: What do I do?

Chaos: Just approach it like
we've been playing in class.

Ginger: That's it? That's all I get?

Chaos: Yeah.

Ginger: Let's do this.

Madonna:.

Gorgeous.

Chaos: And now the moment
you've been waiting for.

I give you Ginger and the
Corn Flake.

Ginger: Okay, okay.

Audience: One, two, three!

I'm so sorry!

Okay, ready?

Audience: One, two, three!

Chaos: Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the Corn Flake Queen.

That's our show for today.

If we made you laugh and clap,
by the looks of it we have,

then please show some
contribution with the hat.

Ginger: Thank you guys.

Thank you, you were great.

Woman: Great show.

Boy: Can I get a photo of you?

Woman: Can I get a photo of you two?

Ginger: Sure.

Woman:.

Ginger: Oh my God, I've
got corn flakes everywhere.

Oh my God, it's going to be cold.

You're a jerk.

I have Corn Flakes in my ear..

It's just that I thought you didn't

have relationships with students.

Chaos: You're not really a student.

Ginger: So is that what we're
doing, having a relationship?

Chaos: Not if you keep talking.

Ginger: What about your
relationship with Dancer?

Chaos: We have an open relationship so

it's not an issue for her.

Ginger: But it's an issue for me.

Chaos: You're right, it's
not going to work out.

Ginger: What did she want to
talk to you about today anyway?

Chaos: She wants me to work
with her at Ringling Brothers.

Ginger: That's fantastic.

Chaos: We're a bit too competitive.

She hasn't surrendered to
the experience like you do.

Ginger: I can't do anything
else, it's too terrifying.

Chaos: You know this was a one-time only,

you working my show?

Ginger: Okay.

You need to come up with your own show

for what you're calling
a "relationship" to work.

Ginger: That's what I want anyway.

Chaos: We need to be
two individual people,

not dependent on one another.

Ginger: All right, I get it.

I think I'm going to go.

It's been a long day.

Chaos: We need to give space for

the winds of time to blow between us.

Ginger: Hi-

What?

Darlene: Darling what
did you do to your hair?

Ginger: Uh ...

It's just time for a change.

Darlene: I need a drink.

Ginger: No, no, no you don't.

It's fine, it's not a problem.

Darlene: You sabotage
any opportunity to work,

after all that we've worked for-

Ginger: No I'm not.

The designer today, he really likes it.

Darlene: He liked it?

Ginger: Yes, and he
treated me differently.

Like I was a real person
and not just some mannequin.

Darlene: Well ...

It limits your opportunity to work.

Ginger: Okay, fine.

Darlene: So you are trying
to sabotage your career.

Ginger: What do you want from me?

Darlene: Darling, I want what

any mother wants for her daughter.

I want you to get married,
and have children,

and have a successful career
as you get older, like me.

Ginger: Saddest thing I've ever heard.

Mom I love you.

But I don't want to be you.

Good night.

Jeff: Hi.

Ginger: Hi. I don't think mom's up yet.

Is she expecting you?

Jeff: I came to see you.

Ginger: Oh. Come in.

Jeff: What happened to your hair?

Ginger: It's my new look.

You don't like it?

Jeff: It's different.

Ginger: Yeah.

Jeff: I wanted to ask you to marry me.

Will you?

Ginger: Um ... Hm.

Gee, Jeff, I thought maybe you

might ask me on a date, or something.

Because we should do that first,
to get to know each other.

Right?

Jeff: I guess.

I'm not very good at that so I thought

I'd skip to the next.

Ginger: You're bit of
a clown, you know that?

No, no, I meant that in a good way.

I've been doing some
clowning down by the beach.

Jeff: Clowning?

Ginger: Yeah.

Have you ever, I don't
know, gone bungee jumping

off a high bridge, or
skydiving, mountain climbing?

No? Huh.

Me neither, but I think
it must feel something

like what clowning on the street does.

Jeff: So is that a no?

Ginger: No?

Jeff: It wasn't a yes though, was it?

Ginger: No.

Jeff: Okay.

Ginger: Okay.

Jeff: I'll check it out.

Ginger: Yeah, the show.
Check out the show.

Thank you.

Dancer: It's the clown student
back for more punishment.

Ginger: Loving every minute.

Dancer: Now we'll see how long that lasts.

Ginger: Hey.

Did you tell her?

Chaos: What?

Ginger: Nothing.

Why's she here?

Chaos: Ringling Brothers needs a decision.

Ginger: It's obvious, isn't it?

Chaos: And she wants to get married.

Ginger: Would that be an open marriage

or the more traditional kind?

Chaos: I don't know. She
gets these ideas in her.

Ginger: This just must
be a day for proposals.

Chaos: You're down late.

Madonna: I couldn't sleep.

So, how is our Corn
Flake clown queen today?

Ginger: Unmarried.

Chaos: Dancer's here, everybody.

Madonna: I think that would
be a good title for your show,

"The Unmarried Clown Show"

The pitch is empty, who's up?

Chaos: It's me.

Dancer: Hey.

How's it hanging?

Madonna: Not bad.

I hate my show, but it's still

earning so I feel a little trapped.

Dancer: Trapped by your own success.

Madonna: Ugh.

Dancer: You want to share?

Madonna: Oh, sure.

Dancer: What about you,
clown student, do you smoke?

Ginger: My name is
Ginger, and no, I don't.

Madonna: Ginger did a great
number in Chaos' show last night.

Dancer: Mm, she did, did she?

Madonna: Yeah. I've got it on my phone.

Ginger: You did? Can I see?

Madonna: Yeah.

Ginger: Oh my God.

I love it.

Dancer: Very good.

Ginger: Ah, the colors are
so pretty on your phone.

Hey, can I make a copy of this?

Madonna: Yeah, I'll put it on
my blog and you can download it.

Ginger: Thanks.

Dancer: What you need now is experience.

Ginger: Yeah.

Dancer: You can do something
in my show if you want.

Ginger: Really?

Okay.

Dancer: Ooh, we've got a first timer.

You want to do this
one, that's a good one.

Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, there we go.

You want to do this
one, that's a good one.

Very nice ladies, watch out for those two.

Woman: Oh!

Ginger: Sorry.

Woman: Ah, ah, ah, ah!

Ginger: No, no, no. It's
okay. See? It's fine.

Chaos: I warned you about her.

Just lie down and let
your emotions settle.

When I say that's the
last time you get to do

a guest spot on my show I
didn't mean for you to go and

prostitute yourself out
with the other performers.

Ginger: She got me stoned.

Chaos: Yeah, she likes to do that.

My point is, it's better
if you get your own show.

Madonna: The Unmarried Clown Show.

Ginger: Sounds like my
mother's worst nightmare.

Chaos: Excellent.

When I gave you the other day.

Ginger: Yeah but that didn't work.

Chaos: You really didn't do
the structure we gave you.

Ginger: I tried, I just
kept making mistakes.

Madonna: There are no mistakes, Ginger.

Ginger: Yeah, because
failure is good, right?

Chaos: Yeah, and that was
the first time you tried it.

It takes many experiments
to perfect a show.

You have to do it over
and over, again and again.

That's why when you get
successful it's so hard to change.

Isn't that right, Madonna?

Madonna: Oh, no.

Chaos: Remember, no mistakes.

Ginger: Now you really
have to do something new.

Madonna: Maybe I'll take that
clown master class tomorrow.

Chaos: Yeah, I am.

Madonna: Are you really?

Chaos: It's a visiting
teacher from New York.

Ginger: Maybe I should take it too.

Chaos: Eh, he might scare it out of you.

And it's not cheap. 500 dollars.

Madonna: 500?

Maybe I'll just work on this
old thing by myself instead.

Ginger: But failure is good, right?

Madonna: Hey, listen
here, you cheeky newcomer.

Don't confront me with my
own words unless you're

ready to put it in practice yourself.

Darlene: Ginger?

Ginger: Yeah, I just
have to pee really fast.

I will be right back.

Darlene: Let me see you.

Ginger: See? I'm all right.

I just fell down.

Darlene: Have you been
hanging out with those clowns?

I told you they were dangerous.

Ginger: It wasn't while I was clowning.

Darlene: If you put yourself
out there it will happen.

Ginger: I'm supposed to stay
stuck in here with you?

Darlene: Are you on drugs?

Ginger: No. I'm tired.

I'm going to go take a nap.

Darlene: We have that
fashion show in an hour.

It better be a quick nap.

Don't worry, I'm going to take you.

Ginger: Great.

Darlene: Ginger, Ginger darling.

I thought you had three
changes this evening.

Ginger: No, I'm just doing one.

Darlene: But they paid for three.

I'm going to talk to Jamie.

Ginger: No-

Darlene: Jamie, darling. Hi.

How come Ginger only has
one outfit this evening?

Jamie: Because her hair
doesn't work with the others.

You're very lucky you
have a creative daughter,

but it's not really what
you what in a model.

Darlene: It's not what you
want in a model, is it.

Don't be creative this evening.

Ginger: Don't be creative?

Mom, you're not helping.

Just stay out of it.

Darlene: What are you looking at?

Ginger: Happy?

Darlene: Of course, dear.

Ginger: Hey, um.

There's this master class

clown teacher I want to take tomorrow.

Darlene: How much is it?

Ginger: 500.

Darlene: 500 dollars?
You've got to be joking.

Ginger: Mom, please.
This is for my career.

Darlene: This is your career!

You're running away from your
career to do all this nonsense.

Ginger: It's not nonsense.

Look, just think of it as
an advance on my allowance.

Or you can take it out of the trust.

I mean, that's my money.

Darlene: No. I'm not going to allow it.

Ginger: Wow, you're hopeless.

I wish just once you
would support my dreams.

But it's your dreams I'm
always having to live up to.

Woman: How do you want to pay?

Debit or credit?

Ginger: Debit.

Woman: Thanks.

Instructor: Take a big breath in,

and touch on whatever that place is.

And let the sound out on the out breath.

Close your eyes and take a big breath.

Now, don't listen to anyone else.

Focus on your expression and let

out a noise on the out breath.

Instructor: Wonderful work
when you let go of your habits.

Okay, who's next?

Come on, I know there's one left.

Who's hiding?

Okay, you are looking for love.

Ginger: Do I get an object?

Instructor: Nope.

Ginger: Okay.

Instructor: No taking
audience members on to stage.

Ginger: Um ...

Instructor: Don't stop, you're doing well.

Ginger: I know but I was
going to use him in my piece.

Instructor: I know, and
I'm not letting you,

because that's another exercise.

We all know you love Chaos, but what we

want to see is why you need love so much.

Keep going, you were doing well.

You were looking for love.

What are you doing?

Ginger: I was looking for love.

Instructor: We want to
see you reveal yourself.

We don't want to see you
telling us a silly story.

Go back to what you were doing

at the start, that was working.

Ginger: I'm sorry I ...

I don't know how.

Instructor: Well, thank goodness

you're expressing yourself now.

Chaos: Ginger wait.

Okay, I know what happened in
there sucked, but I warned you.

Ginger: I can't do it.

Chaos: Yet.

Ginger: Yeah, I can't do it yet.

Chaos: I think you need to
figure out why you're doing it.

Ginger: Usually this is the
point where you come over and

give me a big hug, tell me
that I'm a really good clown,

and that I should keep going.

Chaos: It doesn't matter what I say.

Ginger: It matters to me.

Chaos: See, this is what I meant

by an independent relationship.

We each need to take
responsibility for our own growth.

Can you feel the winds of time?

Ginger: Yeah, I do.

Darlene: I'm very disappointed in you.

Hand it over.

Ginger: I'm going to pay you back.

Darlene: Yeah you will.

You betrayed my faith in you.

Ginger: I kind of had a big day.

I just need to take some time.

Darlene: Maybe you should
find it somewhere else.

Ginger: I really don't need
this from you right now.

Darlene: And I do?

Ginger: Apparently.

Darlene: I am not going to
support your wayward lifestyle.

Ginger: Okay, we're talking
about a theater workshop.

Darlene: You abused my trust.

There have to be consequences.

Ginger: Fine, whatever.

Darlene: The Top Model
competition's tomorrow.

Ginger: I've actually been
thinking about that and I-

Darlene: Ginger, if you don't do this then

it's the end of the road with my support!

Ginger: This is exactly
how you manipulate me.

Darlene: It's your choice.

Ginger: Oh, my choice.

Fine, I'll do it, but I'm
only doing this for you.

Darlene: Well don't worry,
I'll be there to support you.

Ginger: I don't want you there.

Oh, and just so you know, I'm
starting my own street show.

Madonna: So exciting!

All right, last one.

Ah,.

Ginger: I love her. She's so inspiring.

Chaos: She's doing really good.

Ginger: I got a little crows
yesterday, after the workshop.

Chaos: Good for you.

Ginger: I think I'm starting
to see how this all works.

Okay.

Do you think, if I could
get three men up on stage,

I could have a competition for my love?

Chaos: Sure.

Ginger: It could be like,

a competition for my hand in marriage.

And it could be a dance
competition because, you know,

my husband has to be able to dance.

Chaos: You should try.

Ginger: Can you do it?

Chaos: If I'm in the mood.

Ginger: Are you in the mood now?

Chaos: I could be persuaded.

Ginger: Mom? What are you doing here?

Darlene: It's a big day.

We've got to get you ready
for the Top Model competition.

Ginger: I said I didn't need your help.

Darlene: Oh, I won't be
there this afternoon,

but obviously you need
my help to get ready.

Ginger: Get ready?

Darlene: Hair, makeup, facials, oh my God.

Darling, you've got to look your best.

Chaos: Your mother really loves you.

Ginger: Yeah, I promised
I'd do this for her.

Darlene: Nice meeting you.

Ginger who was that boy you were kissing?

Ginger: A friend.

A friend who's helping me
put together a new show.

Darlene: Are you in love with him?

Ginger: Mom. Can we not do the darling

inquisition right before Top Model?

Darlene: I still don't know
why you don't want me there.

Ginger: Because you have
to live your own dreams.

Jeff: I'm really excited.

Think about what this is
going to do for our careers.

Woman: Ginger Carmichael.

Man: Are you wearing underwear?

Could you take your clothes off please?

Ginger: I'm sorry?

Man: We'd like to see
you in your underwear.

Do a couple of turns up
and down the catwalk,

then stop at the end and say your name.

Ginger: Ooh.

Oh, yeah!

Oh, oh, oh!

Thank you.

Darlene: So how did it go?

Ginger: Mom, listen.

Top Model is just not my thing.

Darlene: What do you mean?

Ginger: I don't want to do it.

Darlene: You deliberately threw it off.

Ginger: Why would I say it's not my

thing if I deliberately threw it off?

Darlene: You deliberately threw the

opportunity that we've worked so hard for!

That's why you didn't want me there!

Ginger: You're jumping to
conclusions. This is not-

Darlene: Darlene.

Yeah.

Thank you.

They said you did a striptease.

And you performed an orgasm
with a fire extinguisher.

Ginger: Okay. They told
me to take my clothes off.

So yeah, I performed an orgasm
with a fire extinguisher.

Darlene: Why would you do that?

Ginger: I can't fit into
this box that you want me to.

I have to be myself.

Mom?

Darlene: I warned you about this.

You're going to have to
find somewhere else to live.

It's for your own good.

Ginger: Fine.

This is all too exhausting anyway.

Chaos: You know you're welcome
to stay as long as you like.

Ginger: Oh no, you are not getting

me into your bed that easily, sir.

Chaos: Okay, so you're
going to play hard to get?

There's a spare mattress over there.

Ginger: Good.

Chaos: But uh, I wouldn't recommend

on holding out until we're married.

Ginger: chance of that.

But, you didn't think there was

much chance in a relationship either.

So, I live in hope.

What happened with Dancer and Ringling?

Chaos: They offered me the job.

Ginger: Wow.

Chaos: But I told them
I'm not going to take it.

Ginger: I guess I'm lucky
I caught you when I did.

Chaos: Despite the inherent
foolishness of the task,

I'm now ready to form a
deep, committed relationship,

with you.

Ginger: With me?

A little fast for me.

I think I should go home.

Chaos: I thought you said you can't go.

Ginger: She.

She just wants what's best for me.

I think she'll understand when I explain.

Mom.

Sorry, I didn't know you'd
be going to bed so early.

Darlene: I'm not.

Ginger: Look, I know you told me

to find somewhere else to stay-

Darlene: I'm sorry Ginger.

Ginger: If you would just let me explain.

I think my that chastity is in greater

danger if you throw me out.

Darlene: I'm not going to fall
for that sort of manipulation.

You wanted your freedom, you got it.

Ginger: Fine. I'm just
going to grab some clothes.

Darlene: It's not a good time.

Ginger: Now you're just being silly.

Darlene: It's not a good time!

Ginger: Jeff, what are you doing here?

Jeff: Your mother and I were
just catching up on some work.

I got through the Top Model heat.

Ginger: That's great.

For both of you.

I realized I have to make
the decision for myself.

To do what I want.

Can you get out the other mattress?

Chaos: Sure.

Hey.

What's up man, how's it going?

Good.

Looks like I'm getting a job
with the Ringling Brothers.

Ginger: Are you and
Dancer getting married?

How did you guys know about that?

We haven't told anybody yet.

Ginger: Just a lucky guess.

So, are you guys
doing a show together?

Chaos: No, she's got her own.

That was quick.

Chaos: I know, she's tenacious.

Ew.

Ginger: Shut up.

Excellent.

Hi, hello everyone.

Are you having a good day?

Meet my chicken, he's my friend.

How's it going?

Hey guys, come watch.

It's not scary, I promise.

We're nice people.

Hi, how are you?

Will you stand here for me?

I promise I'll be really nice to you.

How you doing?

Can I have a high five from you too?

I love it.

How are you all doing?

I'm going to do a show
for you, is that okay?

Awesome.

I'm going to tell you all a little story

but I'm going to need you to help me out.

I need you to learn two things.

When I do this, I want you to scream like

you've never been so excited in your life.

Man: Yeah!

Ginger: Oh, he's got
it. He's totally got it.

I want everyone else match that. Ready?

One, two, three.

We don't even have to do it
twice, you guys are so good.

All right, one more thing.

When I point down I want you
to scream, "No way!" Ready?

Audience: No way!

Ginger: Try this one.

This one.

Audience: No way!

Ginger: I think you guys
got it, you're awesome.

My name is Ginger, and I'm a clown.

And today, I was kicked out of my home.

Audience: No way!

Ginger: I didn't hear you,
and you're my front man.

Man: No way!

Ginger: Yes, it's so true.

So I'm alone, and homeless, and
I think what I need to do is

find a nice, young man to take
me in and make me his wife.

What do you think?

All right, let's go man hunting.

Hi, what's your name?

Tyler: Tyler.

Ginger: Tyler, I like you.
I'll come back to you.

And you?

Jay: Jay.

Ginger: Did you see that?

I'm going to leave him for you, okay?

I don't know.

Hello

Man 1: Hello.

I'm going to need your help
on this one, is that okay?

Man 1: Yes.
Ginger: I've got one, guys.

All right. Stand right here.

There's a little too much stuff.

We're going to remove
this item of clothing.

Woo, that's much better.

We like what we see, don't we guys?

All right.

Man 1: I'm so pleased to meet you.

Ginger: You're a lot more
than that, don't worry.

So I think
but I'm getting a little hasty.

I shouldn't just choose
the first man I see, right?

Audience: No way.

Ginger: So I probably need to

have a competition, for my love.

Because love is important, isn't it?

Do you feel me?

Love is really important.

So we need two more, two
more guys to pick from.

Hi.

You, come stand up here.

You are number two.

And, hrm.

How are you?

Man 3: Fine.

Ginger: Good.

You look scared of me, I don't know.

Here for my love. Are you scared?

Man 3: A little bit.

Ginger: A little scared?

Like on a scale of one
to 10 you're like a ...

Man 3: scared.

Ginger: That will do.

Okay, get up here.

We're going to put on some
music, we're going to dance,

and then you're going to help me pick one.

What do you think about that?

All right guys, time
to get your groove on.

Guy number one, let's see what you've got.

He's brushing the shoulders.

Doing the surfer, doing the surfer.

What else do you got? Give me one more.

Oh that's going to be hard to beat.

Guy number two, what do you got?

Oh, he's got the hips.

Got the funky groove.

Show me something else,
show me something else.

Some little snake arms.

I like that, I could do that
for the rest of eternity.

What about you, what have
you got, guy number three?

Oh, he's in a club. He's clubbing.

I think he's still a little
scared. Break out of it.

Oh, there it is. Backing
it up, backing it up.

What about you, what have you got?

Oh, she's sexy. We like her.

What about you? Show me something good.

Give me a little hip bump
out here in the audience?

I think he's still a little
scared. Break out of it.

Oh, there it is. Backing
it up, backing it up.

What about you, what have you got?

Oh, she's sexy. We like her.

What about you? Show me something good.

Give me a little hip bump
out here in the audience?

Yes, well done. Come on.

Yes, well done.

Come on, you know you like it.

Everyone all together.

Dancing with our hips. I
know you've all got hips.

There you go.

Yeah, pump it up.

All right, guys.

Five, four, three, two, one.

Give me a big round of applause
for these guys right here.

By a show of hands, who thinks guy

number three should be my husband?

Woo, that was pretty good. We like you.

By a show of hands, who thinks guy

number two should be my husband?

They like you, don't worry.

You're very good.

Let me help you with that.

Guy 2: Ah, thank you.

Ginger: All right. By a show of hands,

who thinks guy number
one should be my husband?

We have a big winner.

Sorry guys, you were
very lovely to play with.

Why don't you come keep
this lady company over here.

I am all yours, what's your name?

Mike: Hey, I'm Mike.

Ginger: He's right. That's very good.

So Mike, if we're going to
be together for the rest of

eternity I think we need to
do one more test of trust.

What do you guys think?

All right, can you do that for me, Mike?

Mike: Absolutely.

Ginger: Awesome, all right.

I'm going to need you
to lay down right here.

Right on the ground in
front of these nice people.

Are you comfy?

Mike: No.

Ginger: No? That's okay.

I need you to cover this with your eyes,

you're not going to want to see this,

and maybe, you know.

Here's what's going to happen.

I am going to jump over
Mike on my skateboard.

What do you guys think?

This is very difficult.

It's never been done
before, at least not by me.

This is my first time.

Don't be worried.

Mike: I'm worried.

Ginger: It's going to be okay.

Are you okay? Nod your head.

Yes, he's fine.

I just need to take a
little measurement here.

Yeah, that will do.

We have a couple inches
to spare, it's okay.

If this works, Mike and I are

getting married for all eternity.

And if not, it's going to be

a really short term relationship.

It's okay, Mike, I've got this.

I've only been doing this for one day.

Can I get a big round
of applause for Mike?

We're going to count down from
five, four, three, two, one.

And that's it.

All right, you are the love of my life.

Come to me.

Give me a big kiss.

That's it for Mike.

Thank you guys so much.

If you enjoyed the show please
try to show me a little love.

My name is Ginger. Thank you.

Thank you, thank you so much.

Thank you.

Ladies, you're awesome, you're wonderful.

Thank you guys.

Darlene: You were really, really good.

I saw a whole new side of
you today, a whole new side.

Ginger: I think, maybe, you
just saw me for the first time.

Darlene: Maybe.

Preconceptions frequently get in the way.

Ginger: Mom, this is Chaos.

Darlene:.

Ginger: That is his name.

No preconceptions, remember?

Chaos, meet my mother.

Darlene: Nice to meet you.

Chaos: Honored.

Ginger: I'm staying at
his place, by the way.

Darlene: Don't tell me. La-la-la-la.

Ginger: Yeah, you pretend
like you don't know.

I found her and my wannabe fiance
in bed together last night.

Darlene: Oh for God's sakes,

don't be telling everyone.

Chaos: You've got a whole
secret world going on.

Ginger: No, it's her secret world.

I just happened to grow up in it.

Darlene: I love you.

Ginger: I love you.

Darlene: I'm very proud of you.

Ginger: We'll just let the
winds of time flow between us.
