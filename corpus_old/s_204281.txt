The old woman remembered
a swan she had bought...

many years ago in Shanghai
for a foolish sum.

"This bird," boasted
the market vendor...

"was once a duck that
stretched its neck...

in hopes
of becoming a goose.

And now look.
It is too beautiful to eat."

Then the woman and the swan
sailed across an ocean...

many thousands of li wide...

stretching their necks
toward America.

On her journey
she cooed to the swan...

"In America I will have
a daughter just like me.

But over there, nobody will say
her worth is measured...

by the loudness
of her husband's belch.

Over there, nobody will
look down on her...

because I will make her speak
only perfect American English.

And over there, she will always be
too full to swallow any sorrow.

She will know my meaning
because I will give her this swan...

a creature that became more
than what was hoped for."

But when she arrived
in the new country...

the immigration officials
pulled the swan away from her...

leaving the woman
fluttering her arms...

and with only one swan
feather for a memory.

For a long time now,
the woman had wanted...

to give her daughter
the single swan feather...

and tell her, "This feather
may look worthless...

but it comes from afar
and carries with it...

all my good intentions."

Hi!
Oh, Jennifer! Oh, hi!

Hi, June.
Hi.

Yeah, I want-- That's it.
How are you, June?

...the official line
of scrimmage. No gain.

Come on, do or die.
Right here. Come on, do or die!
Come on!

All right, all right,
they're lining up for a pass!
A pass, man!

It's a pass! Here we go, baby!
Fourth and seven.

Here we go. Come on!
Oakland.

All right, all right,
here we go! Here we go!

Yes. Yes. Yes!
Yeah!

Yes! I told you, man!
I told you!

Yeah, you owe me five bucks!

Every morning,
"Wave, Wave, Waverly-a!"

I do not sound like--
She's saying I sound like my--

I do not sound like my mother.
How could I be like my mother?

And you started--
She said that too.

She is right, you know.
This kind of vegetable...
What?

Don't put Chinese cabbage in the salad.
has to be, has to be boiled.

I always use Chinese cabbage--
It's bitter.

Mmm, Dad, that smells good.
Thanks.

No! No!
It will fall apart!
Someone help me now.

I can't believe they're still arguing.
Come on, picture time!

Picture time! Picture time!
All right, picture time now.
Waverly, Waverly loves it!

Aunt Rose! Rose!
Rose! Rose! Rose!

Come on, come on, come on.
Picture, picture.
We're ready.

Come on.
Oh! June.
-June. Come here.

Come on, June!
Get over here!
Get over here!

-Get over here!
-Come on!
-Oh, no, that's all right, Lena.

Come on!
It's all right.
No, really.

Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Go on!
Come on, right now.

-June, come closer, darling. Come closer.
All right, enough.

Enough. Time to take the picture now.
Come on, girls.

All right, let me check your hair.
Okay, it looks nice.

Now smile naturally, Ma.
I always do, Waverly.

You look beautiful.
No, you don't. Do a nice, friendly one.

You look younger all the time.
How is that?
I give you my good skin.

Really? You promise?
You will look like me when you are older.

Yes.
Come close.
I'm close, Mom.

But don't crush my hair.
Say cheese.
I won't.

Cheese!
Cheese!
Cheese!

Ying Ying, take this.

-My mother died four months ago.
-...$9.99.

I realized for the first time,
they wanted me to take my mother's place.

So I sat down on the East,
where things begin...

with my mother's best friends.

My mother started the Joy Luck Club,
having met all these women in church.

Auntie An Mei...

Auntie Lindo...

Auntie Ying Ying.

For 30 years,
these women feasted...

forgot past wrongs,
laughed and played...

lost and won
and told the best stories.

Each week
they hoped to be lucky...

and that hope
was their only joy.

Their connection with each other
had more to do with hope...

than joy or luck.

You win like your mother?
Uh, I only played once...

with some Jewish friends in college.
Hmph! Jewish mah-jong.

Not the same thing.
Entirely different.

Now, Chinese mah-jong
very tricky.

You have to watch
what everybody throw out...

and you keep all this
in your head.

And if nobody play well...

then the game is just like
Jewish mah-jong: no strategy.

You American girls
play Chinese, Jewish.

What's the difference?

Oh.

They were worried.
In me, they see their own daughters.

Just as ignorant of all
the hopes and dreams...

our mothers brought
to this country.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
No talking in Chinese.

Huh?
How do I know you're not cheating?

We would not cheat.
You don't know, but not we.
Ah.

You don't know, but we are your auntie,
and we are very honest people.

We will not cheat you.
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.

Hey, June, why you not
take the piano home?

You only one who play.

When I was nine years old...

my mother's version
of believing in me...

was believing that
I could be anything...

anything she wanted;

the best piano prodigy
this side of China.

I never practiced.

Lucky for me, old Mr. Chong
couldn't tell the difference.

He'd gone stone-deaf
over the years.

Me and Beethoven,
we both hear it in our head!

Okey-dokey.
Now, how many sharps...

how many flats?

What key are we in?
Z major.

What? Good.
Z major!

Now, for the recital...

more feeling...

more gusto!

I'm a girl and by me
that's only great

I am proud that
my silhouette is curvy

When I was young,
Auntie Lindo...

was my mother's
best friend and archenemy.

Their weapons of choice
were comparing their children.

Mom was sick of hearing
Auntie Lindo brag...

about her daughter Waverly, who
was Chinatown's chess champion.

That night Mom figured
I'd redeem her...

with my international piano debut.
I ask my daughter...

"Help me carry grocery."

She think this too much ask.

All day long she play chess.

I dust off all her trophy.
Appreciate me? No.

You lucky you don't have
the same problem.

My problem
worser than yours.

If I tell June
time to wash dish...

she hear nothing but music.

It's like you can't stop
this natural talent.

Being a girl

Until that night,
I didn't believe I was a prodigy.

Twerp.

In fact, I used to go out of my way
to prove my mother wrong...

that I wasn't cut out
to be the best anything...

I could only be me.

It was incredible. It was like my hands
were possessed by Mozart.

And everybody could see this,
could hear this.

I was a genius.
I had been discovered.

And then I heard it.

Maybe they didn't notice.

Bravo! Bravo!
Encore! Well done!

Here we come
Walkin' down the street

After the talent show fiasco...
Get the funniest looks from

I figured I never had
to play the piano again.
Everyone we meet

4:00. Turn off TV.
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees

Practice piano time.
People say we monkey around

I couldn't believe what she
was saying. Like I was...
But we're too busy singin'

supposed to go through the
same torture again. Forget it.
To put anybody down

What I say? 4:00.
We're just tryin' to be friendly

-Come and watch us sing and play
-I'm not going to play any more.

Why should I?
We're the young generation

What did you say?
And we've got something to say

I'm not your slave.
This isn't China.

You can't make me.

Get up!
No! No, I won't.

No!

No! No, I won't.

You want me to be someone I'm not!
I'll never be the kind of daughter
that you want me to be!

There be two kinds of daughter:
obedient or follow own mind.

Only one kind of daughter
could live in this house:

obedient kind.
Then I wish I wasn't your daughter!

I wish you weren't my mom!

Too late to change this.

That's when I remembered
what we could never talk about.

Then I wish I were dead...

like them, the babies
that you killed in China!

My mother had once told me
this strange story...

what happened
to her in China.

She said she was going to Chungking
to meet the man who was her husband.

That was the first time I ever heard
she was married before my father.

She barely had time to grab
her babies, twin girls.

That was the first time
I heard she had other babies.

I always try to picture
in my mind what really happened...

but she would never explain.

She would only say by the time
she reached Chungking...

she had lost everything.

And I said,
"Wait, what do you mean 'everything'?

What happened
to those babies?"

There were so many things about
my mother I never understood.

This is the only one
I never forgave.

The babies.

You know?
Two babies?

The babies? We all thought
that the babies had died.

But last month at a church picnic--
You know...

two babies your mother leave
on the roadside, in wartime?

It's miracle,
but we find them.

Yes! Can you imagine?
They still alive!

What are you saying?
They're alive?

I think your mother
always want to find them...

her long-cherished wish.

So after she died,
we tried for her;

writing, writing, writing.
"My--"

This is from them, those babies?
Ah, no baby anymore.

They're alive!

Oh, what does it say?
What does it mean?

It say--
See here?

They are very glad--
No, no, no, no, no.

Overjoyed beyond belief...

at last find you,
their little sister.

And they say--
See here?

How sad, how very sad...

too late to meet their mother...

now she no longer in this world.

Yes, yes.

It says--
See here?

You must come to China
and meet them...

and tell them
all about their mother.

What could I tell them?

I didn't know anything
about her. She was--

She was my mother.
What do you mean?
Tell them how smart she was...

Your mother is your voice.
how kind she was.

Everyone love her.
How sincere, how hard-working she was.

And the excellent dishes she cooked.
Even better than mine.

And how beautiful she sang.
Don't you remember?

How can a daughter
not know her own mother?

You're right.
I will tell them.

I-I should.
I want to.

June? June.

What you thinking?

Oh, those babies,
of course. The twins.

I can't believe I'm actually
going to meet them.

How sad they must have been
when you told them Mom died.

That must have been the hardest
letter for you to write.

Oh, peanut bowl empty.

Oh! Oh, I'll get us some.

All this time never
telling her the truth.

Must tell her today.
How can you not tell her?

How can I tell her what
the letter really say?

Then she never go to China,
never go to see her sister.

Am I right?
Yes, of course.

Lindo, I still think it's wrong.

It's so sad for those babies.

How could Suyuan
give them up?

To lose a mother so young...

to wonder why.

Even to this day I wonder...

how my own mother
could give me up.

That day...

when I was only
four years old...

I came upon a meeting...

that would change
my life forever.

Come here quick.

Come here.

Huang Tai Tai,
this is my daughter.

Come here, Lindo.

Come over here.

Come to Mama.

Don't keep Huang Tai Tai waiting.

She looks like a brat.

She's usually very obedient.

She's just shy today.

I didn't know it, but that day
my mother made a promise:

that when I became 1 5, I would
go live in this woman's house...
She looks so skinny.

Don't go by her looks.

Look at that lucky face.

She'll give you many grandsons.

and fulfill the old matchmaker's
guarantee to have many sons...

with a husband
I had never met before.
Come here! Come here!

Have Huang Tai Tai
take a closer look at you.

Stop stuffing yourself!.

No girl should eat so fast.

For the next ten years...

my mother treated me as if
I already belonged to Huang Tai Tai.

Look at those dirty spots!

Who would want such a dirty
daughter-in-law?

Always be careful.

Otherwise when you go
to Huang Tai Tai's...

she will disapprove of you.

My mother did not say these things
because she didn't love me.

She said these things...

so she would not wish
for something...

that was no longer hers.

And then one day...

my mother said our whole family
was moving to the south.

Everyone except me.

Remember...

when you see Huang Tai Tai...

act happy.

Really, you are very lucky.

The marriage ceremony has begun.

Bride and groom,
pay respect to each other.

Pay respect to the ancestors.

Be blessed with prosperity!

Be blessed with many sons!

That night I would meet
my husband for the first time;

the one who would
control my destiny...

decide whether
I was happy or not.

This one moment would decide
for my whole life...

whether fear would rule...

or I would.

I decided
underneath I knew who I was.

I promised myself
never to forget.

I have prayed to the gods
many days for you...

so that you were not too ugly...

or too old.

I must have prayed too hard.

Ha! Scared you to death!

I am the husband.

I make all the decisions.

You sleep on the floor.

Do it! Do it now!

The next few years,
I tried to accept my life...

to act like an obedient wife.

Every night I made
Huang Tai Tai special soup...

good for mother-in-laws.

Still, she was not pleased.

Where are my grandsons?

My son says...

you often refuse...

to sleep with him.

What kind of a wife are you?

You sleep on your side.

After that,
I slept with my husband.

Every night
I slept with him...

just like brother and sister.

Where are my grandsons?

Huh?

My son says he's planted enough
seeds in you to fill a basket.

Plenty for
ten thousand grandsons!

It's all your fault!

Always running around...

letting my son's seeds
spill out.

From now on...

you lie in bed all day.

Lie down!

Lie down!

Until my grandson comes!

Do you hear me?

Disgusting little thing!

Close all the windows!

Feel this.
I'm pregnant.

That's impossible.

It's yours!

What'd I tell you?

She's like this all the time.

What the hell's happening?

What's wrong?

Tell me quick!

It's so scary.

It's too terrible to say.

I had a bad dream.

Our ancestors came to me!

So angry!

They told me if Tyan-yu stays...

in this marriage...

he will die.

What's this bullshit?

What a stupid girl
to have bad dreams!

The ancestors said...

if the matter is
not settled immediately...

they will begin...

the cycle of destruction!

There are three signs, he said.

First, he has drawn a spot
on Tyan-yu's back.

And this spot will eat away
Tyan-yu's flesh.

Just as it ate away
our ancestor's face.

The same mole I had seen
during all those nights...

of sleeping just like
brother and sister.

Next, our ancestor
touched my mouth.

Our ancestor said...

if I don't leave this marriage...

all my teeth will fall out.

But how could I leave
this family I love so much?

I live and die
for this family.

The open spot in my mouth...

where a rotted tooth
fell out four years ago.

Our ancestor also said
this girl here...

is Tyan-yu's
true spiritual wife...

already growing his son!

It's true!

To prove it our ancestor
planted the seed in her womb.

Already ripe in one day.

Ah Ping!
Come over here!

Come over here!

If you don't believe me,
ask the matchmaker.

I told them the matchmaker
had made the wrong match...

on purpose,
just for money.

Matchmaker, how could you?

How could you?

Well...

mistakes happen in Heaven.

The hell with this!

Get out!

All of you!

Huang Tai Tai
got her grandson.

The servant girl
got her marriage.

I got a rail ticket to Shanghai.

So, you see, I still kept
my promise to my mother.

But years later, things
were somewhat different...

with my daughter
Waverly's wedding.

Ma, it's me.
Oh, Waverly-a.

You already at the beauty parlor?
No.

No?
No, I'm-- I have a headache.

Headache?
You have a headache?

So you cannot keep
your promise to your mother?

Ma!
No, don't come.
Why should I want you to come...

when all you're telling me
you don't want to come?

Ma, that's not what I said!
What's wrong with the way I look now?

I just go to wedding
with old hair.

Shit!
She always does this!

My mom always does this.

Whatever I say,
whatever I do...

whatever I think...

she always has
the perfect countermove.

As if she had been
the chess champion.

Even at that age,
I knew I had an amazing gift:

this power,
this belief in myself...

to be better than anyone else.

If someone was bigger than me,
older than me, it didn't matter.

And if they were mean,
I could make'em sorry.

Checkmate.

Congratulations.
She was--

It was the only part
of my life, to this day...

where I trusted myself
completely.

Very good.
Thank you.

Good work.
Thank you.
You did good.

I was safe there.
Very nice job.
We've been very lucky.

I still cry remembering that.
Thank you.

You not see Life magazine?
No.

I told my daughter, "Use your
horses to run over the enemy."

One fine day
She won very quickly this way.

Oh, good.
You'll look at me
Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.
Say bye-bye.
And you will know

Our love was meant to be
Bye.
Bye.

One fine day
Hi.

You're gonna want me for your girl
Ah, Mrs. Chew!

Oh, you know my daughter,
Waverly Jong, chess champion?

The arms I long for will open wide
Smart girl! Bye.

Thank you. Bye-bye.
And you'll be proud to have me

I wish you wouldn't do that,
telling everyone I'm your daughter.

What you mean? You so ashamed
to be with your mother?
One fine day

You're gonna want me for your girl
It's not that.

It's just that it's so...

embarrassing, that's all.
What? Embarrassed you be my daughter?

I'll keep waiting and some day, darling
That's not what I said.

Then what you say? Look at me!
You'll come to me

When you want to settle down
Look at me!

Oh, one fine day
Why do you have to use me to show off?

We'll meet once more
If you want to show off...

And then you'll want the love
then why don't you learn to play chess?

You threw away before

One fine day

You're gonna want me
for your girl

Waverly! Waverly!
You come back!

About time.
Boy, are you in trouble.

Sit down. Eat.

This girl not have
concerning for us.

We not concerning
this girl.

I'm never gonna
play chess again!

You can't make me!

You can torture me
all you want...

I still won't.

Did you hear what I said?

For months I kept expecting Ma
to beg me to play chess again...

but she never mentioned it,
as if I had never played at all.

Guess what? I've decided
to play chess again.

You think it is so easy.

One day quit,
next day play.

Everything for you
is this way.

So smart, so easy, so fast.

Not so easy anymore.

What she said,
it was like a curse.

This power I had,
this belief in myself...

I could actually
feel it draining away.

I could feel myself
becoming so ordinary.

All the secrets I once saw...

I couldn't
see them anymore.

All I could see was--

were my mistakes,
my weaknesses.

The best part of me just...

Check.
disappeared.

But I can't put it all
on my mother.

I did it to myself.

I never played chess again.

She needs a cut
and a perm, Trevor.

And this color of hers, it's from that
cheap black dye she's been using at home.

God forbid she'd pay to have
anything professionally done.

Why I should pay?
What for?

Why I should pay 90 dollar?
To act like you? So important.

Go to fancy barber
with torn-up jeans.

Darlene, we need
a shampoo here.

I mean, I even married
a Chinese guy to please her.

He was gorgeous.
He gave her a granddaughter.

But was she satisfied?

When we got divorced, she got
all upset like it was my fault.

I just want to show you
something. It's upstairs.

Watch out for Shoshana's toys.
And when I finally started dating again...

when I tried to hint
to her about Rich...

that we were
living together--

How could she not notice?

This was not going to go away,
even with her silent treatment.

This is what
I wanted to show you.

You know Rich,
the guy I told you about?

I don't know why he got it for me.
It's really never cold enough to wear.

You wanna try it?

This not so good.

Only leftover strips.

See? Fur too short.

No long hairs.

How can you
criticize a gift?

He gave this to me
with all his heart.

That's why I told you.
Not so good.

I wasn't going to let her
get away with it this time...

making me feel bad about Rich,
the love of my life...

who treated me
like I was perfect.

Well, aren't you going
to say anything else?

What I should say?

About the apartment,
about this!

And this!

Or this!

All of this!

We're here!
Where is everybody?

The next week I brought Rich to Mom's
birthday dinner, sort of a surprise present.

I figured she was going to have
to accept Rich, like it or not.

Oh, Rich, this is my father.
How ya doin'?

Happy birthday, Mom.
How are you?
I'm good, thank you.

And, Ma, this is Rich.

Great to meet you.
Boy, something smells wonderful.

I guess we came to the right
place, huh? Here you are.

You know, Waverly has been telling me
that you are the best cook.

I think maybe we got her.

So many spots on his face.

Of course, the night
was still young.

Thank god I already prepped
him on the Emily Post of Chinese manners.

Hi, Uncle.
How are you?

Actually, there were a few things
I forgot to mention.

Uh, let me make a toast.

He shouldn't have had that second glass...
Here's to...

when everyone else had
had only half an inch...
everyone in the family.

just for taste.

Shrimp. My favorite.

He should have taken only
a small spoonful of the best dish...

until everyone had
had a helping.

He has good appetite.

He shouldn't have bragged
he was a fast learner.

But the worst was when Rich
criticized my mother's cooking...

and he didn't even know
what he had done.

As is the Chinese
cook's custom...

my mother always
insults her own cooking...

but only with the dishes
she serves with special pride.

This dish not salty enough.

No flavor.
It's too bad to eat.

But please--

Oh!

That was our cue
to eat some...

and proclaim it
the best she'd ever made.

You know, Lindo...

all this needs is
a little soy sauce.

Oh! Uh, oh.

So, how'd your mom react when
you told her about the wedding?

It never came up.

How come?

She'd rather get
rectal cancer.

Oh.

Ma, a soft wave for body.
What do you think?

Look, she doesn't
want it too short.

Otherwise it'll be
too tight for the wedding.

And we don't want it
looking too weird or kinky.

Isn't that right, Ma?
Not too kinky?

Why does my daughter think
she's translating English for me?

Maybe I don't go.

What do you mean?
Maybe I don't go to your wedding.

Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Maybe already ridiculous.

Hair too ridiculous for
future husband's family.

I could see her face
looking at me...

but not seeing me.

She was ashamed...

so ashamed
to be my daughter.

Ma?

What's wrong?
Nothing.

Nothing.
I-- I only thinking...

thinking about my mother...

how much I wanted
to be like her.

Your mother?

She told me...

all the hopes
she had for me...

words I would never forget.

You're so lucky.

You don't have ears like mine.

You'll have a better life!

But listen carefully
to what is calling.

Can you feel in your heart...

what I am saying?

Will you always keep it there?

You know...

after today...

I will never...

give you any more advice.

In my memory, my--

my mother very
important to me...

just like her words.

Easy to appreciate memory.

Ma?

Why don't you like Rich?

It's Rich you afraid
I not like?

If I don't like your Rich...

I act polite, say nothing;

let him have big cancer...

let my daughter be a widow.

I like Rich.
Of course I do...

to allow him to marry
such a daughter.

You don't know--

You don't know the power
you have over me.

One word from you,
one look...

and I'm...

four years old again,
crying myself to sleep.

Because nothing I do...

can ever, ever please you.

Now--

Now you make me happy.

Look, look, look, look, Ma, Ma,
Auntie Ying, Auntie Ying.

I did it.
Rich!

Where'd it go?
Did it go inside?

-Oh, come on.
-God, I can't take you anywhere.

So where'd it end up?
Oh, Lena, do you want to eat?

Thank you.
Oh, here's a fork.

Okay.
Well, I'm trying.

Ta-la!
Oh!

Wow! That's beautiful, huh?

Oh, oh.

What's the matter,
guest of honor?

Yeah!
Should eat more!

Should eat more!
Too skinny!

Well, I thought you said
I was getting fat.

Auntie An Mei said that.
Why you always confusing us?
Oh, look.

June so happy,
going to China...

see her sisters at last.

Only steamed.
Can't get you fat.

How terrible for Suyuan...

to lose your babies...

never know if they
are alive or dead.

Only one thing's worse.

I was only 1 6.

Stop looking!

Ying Ying.

Ying Ying.

Open the watermelon!

Dog fart!

Ah, Lin Xiao--

Lin Xiao.

After that, everything
like this dream.

Our wedding...

our son.

Honored guests!

Thank you for coming.

I have persuaded
the famous diva, Miss Bai Yen...

to sing in honor of my son.
There he was...

with his opera singer.

This was not
his first conquest...

only the first I permitted
myself to recognize.

By then I knew what kind
of man I had married:

happiest when he was cruel.

Let me have him.

He became forgetful.

Don't touch it!

So forgetful he had not
returned by the next morning.

Or the next evening.

Who's this?

This person is a whore.

Just like you.

My son!

My son!

Listen to that voice!

Strong...

like his father!

Look at you!
Disgusting!

You make me sick!

Clean up this mess!

You hear me?

My whole life turned
in this moment.

If I had left him
or killed him...

I would not have lost
the one thing that mattered.

My mind kept repeating
a single thought.

He had taken from me
my innocence...

my youth, my heart,
everything.

So I took from him
the only thing I could.

My baby was so light
in my arms...

because his little spirit
had flown away.

And with his,
my spirit had also gone.

Years later,
I moved to America.

But what I had done in China
was always with me.

In time, I remarried...

and I had a daughter.

But Lena had no spirit...

because I had none
to give her.

Mommy?

Mommy?

Are you hungry yet?

Mom?

Mommy, please answer me.

Mommy? Oh, Mom!

As I was growing up...

there were times when Mom
went through these bad spells.

She often seemed
scared and sad.

But she would never
talk about it...

except to say that she had been
married to a bad man in China.

Over the years
Mom got better...

although it seemed like all her fears
turned into worries about me.

So now that I'm married...

and she's visiting
our new house...

I hope she can finally
be happy for me.

Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

He's very nice to me.

Nice.

Nice. Very nice.

Oh, Mom? Mom--
What's this?

Why don't you, uh, rest
in the living room?

I'll make you
some tea, okay?

I've got some
chrysanthemum tea.

What's this writing?
Mom! It's nothing.

You know. It's just
the things we share.

At least that's what
Harold calls it.

Sharing.
Everything 50-50.

So our love is always equal.

The irony is, I was the one
who started it that way.
Let's see--

Forty-one dollars.
Oh, total?

Each. What?
You don't have enough?

No, it's, uh...

it's just, uh, I was
never very good at math.

So what if I had a salad
and he had three courses?

We were equals.

Except that I work in his firm
and he pays himself...

seven times more
than he pays me.

Seven and a half.

And then last year, when we
finally decided to get married...

we agreed: love, yes;
false dependencies, no.

With most everything,
we keep track of what we spend...

then split it 50-50.

Of course we agreed early on
not to include personal stuff...

like my tampons and
feminine hygiene spray...

and his shaving lotion
and foot powder.

Honey, isn't there
a generic brand of cat food?

I mean, do they know the difference?
For crying out loud, $34.76.

But we still have these
philosophical arguments...

about the gray areas.

Like magazines I subscribe to,
which he reads...

but only because they're there.

And the cat.

Even the goddamn cat's fleas.

You gave her to me
as a birthday gift.

And now you want me to pay
to get rid of her fleas?

Ice cream you don't share.

You don't eat ice cream.

Ever since that time you got sick on
strawberry and chocolate flavor together.

I remember.

Now you must pay for half
of his ice cream?

Why do you do this?

Lena?

Hmm.

Lena, when you buy charcoal,
you have to buy lighter fluid.

Don't you know that yet? Do I
have to remind you every time?

Lena cannot eat ice cream.

What?

What are we talking about?

It's true. I've hated
ice cream all my life.

I don't touch the stuff.

Well, I assumed you were always
trying to diet or something.

Oh, yes, she's lost so much weight
you can't see her anymore.

Hmm.

One million dollars,
and the walls are still crooked.

It's bad luck.
Harold wanted to keep it
that way for the effect.

For effect? A person has to lie here
thinking she's in a coffin?

Oh!
Careful. It's not too sturdy.

Harold made it back in college.

Why do you keep it?

You put one more thing on top
and everything falls down.

Do you need anything else?

No.
Okay.

No. Nothing.

...competition.

What is a drag race?
What an idiot!

Regatta, not drag race!

I don't believe this guy!

It's cold.

Excuse me?

I said, would you close
the window, please? It's cold.

That's right for 1,000.
Takes you to an even 6,000.

Oh, there's the bell
for "Final Jeopardy."

You have 30 seconds to come up
with the right question.

Honey, move.
What's goin' on?

I don't think you should get credit
for your ice cream anymore.

Fine. You got it.
End of discussion.

Why do you have to be
so goddamn fair?

Now at 10,400, but you're
still not in the lead. Nancy--

Just what is this
about exactly?

I don't know.
Maybe everything.

The way we account for
everything. What we share, what
we don't share. I'm sick of it.

Adding things up, subtracting. Making it
come out even when it's not. I'm sick of it.

You're the one
who wanted the cat!

What are you talking about?
All right.

If you think I'm being unfair,
we'll both pay for the fleas.

This is not about fleas.
That is not the point.

Then, please, tell me.

What is the point?

I-- I just think that we
need to change things.

We need to think about
what this marriage is based on...

not this balance sheet.
Well, I know what
our marriage is based upon.

And if you don't,
then you better think about it...

before you start
to change things.

All around this house,
I see the signs.

My daughter looks,
but she does not see.

This is a house that
will break into pieces.

Mom?

It's not too late.

All my pains, my regrets...

I will gather them together.

My daughter will hear me calling,
even though I've said no words.

She will climb the stairs
to find me.

Mom?
She will be scared...

because at first
her eyes will see nothing.

She will feel in her heart...
Mom?

this place where she hides her fears.
Mom?

She will know...

I am waiting
like a tiger in the trees...

now ready to leap out
and cut her spirit loose.

Mom.

Do you know what you want?

I mean, from him.

Respect.

Tenderness.

Then tell him now.

And leave this lopsided house.

Do not come back
until he give you those things.

With both hands open.

I can't..

Losing him does not matter.

It is you who will be found... 

and cherished.
