Sometimes it just feeIs Iike Bosnia

( hip-hop music playing )

Hi, Mr. Decker.

I do have more important shit
to worry about right now, okay?

What do you think
of this, pussycat?

Very nice.
What do you think?

Ah, Nice.

Disgusting.

A high schooI.

Who wouId ever suspect
a high schooI?

It's perfect.

Just take the pictures.

You got it?

2,000 a week, pIus medicaI
and profit participation.

Start first thing Monday.

That's great.

I have enough troubIe with students
having sex Iike rabbits.

I don't need teachers
making it worse.

Yeah.

well, as a matter of fact,
you'Ve got a point there, Lyle.

I don't see any other choice
so I'm just going to have to quit.

That's my Ietter of resignation,
effective today.

Excuse me,
I'm Iate for history cIass.

He's joking, right?

No. No, he's not.

So ultimately, the aerial bombing
campaign by the United States,

faiIed to defeat the north.

Who knows why?

Man: who the fuck cares?
Hey. CharIee?

Ah...
Why was that cruciaI?

Sorry, Mr. Decker, I don't know.
Neither do I, sir.

Why the heII are we taIking about--
AII right, guys, quiet. Mick?

What's the point? Who gives a shit
about history anyway?

There it is. See?
The point is this.

It doesn't matter who has more
soIdiers or more bombs.

Whoever is the most committed
to their cause, aIways wins.

Thank you!
Okay, guys.

Thanks a lot.
AII right, Mick.

AII right, get out of here.
See you in the gym.

I'm open!
Defense.

Come on, pass it up!
Whoo-hoo!

I got this.
What?

Come on, find your zone.

What are you Iooking at?

A FOG.
What's a FOG?

F-O-G, FuckabIe OIder Guy.

Yeah? Just don't get pregnant.

You're a good teacher, Sam.

The kind we can't afford to lose.

Come on, LyIe,
we don't teach here.

This isn't a schooI,
it's a prison.

We just detain these kids untiI
they're oId enough to graduate

with dipIomas
they can't even read.

It's my Iast day.

Okay.

Macer's mother's in the hospitaI.

I need someone to fiII in
for his detention cIass.

What?

You're actuaIIy
making me stay after schooI?

WeII, don't think of it
as a punishment.

Think of it as a...
a parting gesture.

Motherfucker!

Break it up!
Take him down, Jay Tee.

Okay. Come on,
that's enough. Hey.

That's enough.

AsshoIe threatened to kiII me.
You can expeI him for that.

What?
Come on.

Detention shouId be pIenty.
What for?

You can't stop shit.
I heard you knocked up AIicia.

What happened?
Rubber too big and faII off?

What?
That's enough. I said enough.

Hit the showers.
Hey! Go on, hit the showers.

FederaI Agent GIen Prokow,
Secret Service.

As of now, this precinct and aII units
are under my direct controI

during the visit of the vice-president.

What?

BuIIshit.
You don't have the authority.

FederaI Iaw gives me
the authority.

Since when?

ApriI 15, 1865.
The day after LincoIn was shot.

You gotta be shitting me.

LyIe's reaIIy pissed.

Yeah, I know.

He put me on detention.

Oh.

You know, I think
he actuaIIy Iikes you,

God knows why.

It's not him. It's...

it's this pIace.

I don't know why
you wanna stay.

You know me.

Besides, this pIace
does have some very...

pIeasant memories.

Mr. Decker, I need to see you
in your cIassroom for a moment.

Come on, l'll be late
for detention.

l don't care.

I wanna do it one Iast time
with the teacher.

Oh, girI, what's wrong?
You aII right?

Nothing.
Get out of my face.

Listen, why don't you
come with me?

Some other Iifetime, maybe.

Come on, girI, I know
a nice quiet pIace

where we can party.

ExceIIent, pussycat.

What are you doing?

You don't want to cut
the upholstery

because it has to Iook perfect.

GIoria, teII them to be
carefuI in Hungarian.

( GIoria speaks Hungarian )

( Lamb repeats in Hungarian )

Fuck up.

We speak EngIish,

Back to work.

WeII...

I can see you're aII
as happy to be here as I am.

AIicia?
The sub in Math booked me.

ApparentIy he didn't think me
having to pee aII the damn time

was a Iegitimate excuse
for being Iate for cIass.

What is this, a maternity ward?

Look, you don't have to stick around.
Why don't you go home?

What? What?
Nah, it's okay, Mr. Decker.

I'II do my time. It's okay.

Evening, Mr. Neeson.
Hey, MiIt.

Oh, hi.

Ah, we've-- we've come

From where?
From the...

I'm an accountant.
They want more money, you see?

And before we do that,
we want to see

what kind of work has
actuaIIy been done,

because we can't just
give money--

Done here today?
Yes, today.

Today was great.
Oh, good. WonderfuI.

You shouId see the stuff

The equipment they had
here today was unreaI.

Today they had some
really good machinery in here,

and it was unbelieVable--
That's very nice. Thank you.

Hey, hey!

The gate. The door.
The thing. Chop-chop.

I've got over a ton of smack

going into the incinerator
in this van,

and it does not go without an escort.
we depart in 45 minutes.

You can't be suggesting that
a shipment of heroin is more important

than the visit of the Vice-president
of the United States.

I've onIy got so much manpower.
That's your department, Sergeant.

Mine is the protection of the second
most powerfuI man in the worId.

No question in my mind
which takes priority.

Why don't you find
something to do?

Nice tie.

Testing.

One, two, three.

Can you hear me?

Teacher, teacher...

Lamb, they are in.

ExceIIent, pussycat.
Get to the auditorium.

Set off the aIarm?

Try me.

Okay, WiIIy.

I don't need teachers

Yeah.

you'Ve got a point there, Lyle.

I don't see any other choice

That's my Ietter of resignation,
effective today.

Excuse me,
I'm Iate for history cIass.

He's joking, right?

So ultimately, the aerial bombing

Who knows why?

Man: who the fuck cares?
Hey. CharIee?

AII right, guys, quiet. Mick?

What's the point? Who gives a shit

There it is. See?
The point is this.

It doesn't matter who has more
soIdiers or more bombs.

Whoever is the most committed

Thank you!
Okay, guys.

Thanks a lot.

A FOG.
What's a FOG?

F-O-G, FuckabIe OIder Guy.

Yeah? Just don't get pregnant.

You're a good teacher, Sam.

The kind we can't afford to lose.

Come on, LyIe,
we don't teach here.

This isn't a schooI,
it's a prison.

We just detain these kids untiI
they're oId enough to graduate

with dipIomas
they can't even read.

It's my Iast day.

Okay.

Macer's mother's in the hospitaI.

I need someone to fiII in
for his detention cIass.

What?

You're actuaIIy
making me stay after schooI?

WeII, don't think of it
as a punishment.

Think of it as a...
a parting gesture.

Motherfucker!

Break it up!
Take him down, Jay Tee.

Okay. Come on,
that's enough. Hey.

That's enough.

AsshoIe threatened to kiII me.
You can expeI him for that.

Come on.

Detention shouId be pIenty.

You can't stop shit.
I heard you knocked up AIicia.

What happened?
Rubber too big and faII off?

That's enough. I said enough.

Hit the showers.
Hey! Go on, hit the showers.

FederaI Agent GIen Prokow,
Secret Service.

As of now, this precinct and aII units

What?

BuIIshit.
You don't have the authority.

FederaI Iaw gives me

Since when?

ApriI 15, 1865.
The day after LincoIn was shot.

You gotta be shitting me.

LyIe's reaIIy pissed.

Yeah, I know.

He put me on detention.

Oh.

You know, I think
he actuaIIy Iikes you,

God knows why.

It's not him. It's...

it's this pIace.

I don't know why
you wanna stay.

You know me.

Besides, this pIace
does have some very...

pIeasant memories.

Mr. Decker, I need to see you
in your cIassroom for a moment.

Come on, l'll be late
for detention.

l don't care.

I wanna do it one Iast time

Oh, girI, what's wrong?
You aII right?

Nothing.
Get out of my face.

Listen, why don't you
come with me?

Some other Iifetime, maybe.

Come on, girI, I know

where we can party.

ExceIIent, pussycat.

What are you doing?

You don't want to cut

because it has to Iook perfect.

GIoria, teII them to be

Back to work.

WeII...

I can see you're aII
as happy to be here as I am.

AIicia?
The sub in Math booked me.

ApparentIy he didn't think me
having to pee aII the damn time

was a Iegitimate excuse
for being Iate for cIass.

What is this, a maternity ward?

Look, you don't have to stick around.
Why don't you go home?

What? What?
Nah, it's okay, Mr. Decker.

I'II do my time. It's okay.

Evening, Mr. Neeson.

Oh, hi.

My name is Dennis Kaye.

Ah, we've-- we've come

From where?
From the...

from the firm that's
buiIding this.

I'm an accountant.
They want more money, you see?

And before we do that,
we want to see

what kind of work has
actuaIIy been done,

because we can't just
give money--

Done here today?
Yes, today.

Today was great.
Oh, good. WonderfuI.

You shouId see the stuff

The equipment they had

Today they had some

and it was unbelieVable--
That's very nice. Thank you.

Hey, hey!

The gate. The door.
The thing. Chop-chop.
