"COLLIDE"

Reasons,

We all got our reasons to do crazy,

and reckless in life.

Mostly they don't help you none.

Not when you are left to pick up the pieces.

But if the reason is love,

Maybe not so crazy, because people believe in love.

They know it keeps the world turning.

And right now,

That's the only thing keeping me alive.

"Cologne-Germany"

What did you do?
What did you say you wanted?

Double.

American?

It is so obvious?
No, no, no I heard you at the bar.

I mean it's like fate right?

You know two Americans in the middle of a rave, Germany?

Do you believe in fate? 
Is that a line?

That's cold ...
With lines like that you better expect it!

I'm going to start again.

Oh, HI!
Hey!

Do you believe in fate?

I guess not, it sort of takes the fun things, you know?

What if you did more exciting?

Are you high?
No, no, but...

My point is everything that happens, 
has already happened. Its fate.

Oh that's more exciting, because...
You have already given me your phone number so what is the difference?

I knew it was a line!

I did work better in my head, like the build up and everything I don't know.
I admire the ground work.

Thank-you, yeh!

I'm Casey. 
Juliette.

Juliet what?

If it's fate and we slept together you should know my last name.

What?

Wait!
Hang on!

So what are you doing here?

What this place?
In Germany.

You wanna know the truth?

Preferably...

Um I got into bad stuff in States.

43  
Nothing serious, just young and stupid and...

decided to use some of the money I had to leave, see the world.

You got to go back?
No.

Nothing to go back to.

How about you?

Originally to study.

and get away from my parents.

They did a lot of drugs...

a lot of fighting and not a lot of being parents. 

You um, you still studying?

Not, I'm not sure what I doing.

Oh, while you're not sure, you want to spend your time with me?

With you? 
Yeah!

Well, I um...

I appreciate asking and you're cute, nice and everything, but...

But I've seen here, and what you're involved in.

I have no objection, we all like to party.

It's just that in my experience, guys into that lifestyle...

It's not the guys I'm looking for.

No, I'm not your typical...
No, No I...

63 
I don't think you are.

If you ever decide to make it official... 
you can let me know.

Wow...

Anyway it was nice to meet you. 
Ya you too.

See you around.

Party boy!

What's going on? 
Stop flirting with those guys.

Seriously, Geran is waiting for us.

Look at this!

You like John Travolta?

Have you seen this movie? "Perfect"? 

With Jamie Curtis, butt aerobico.

Good film.

Acting not so much but Travolta

Shit, that man! He should have Oscar.

Who this?

I'm Casey.
What?

I've been working for six months.

What?

Casey!

Oh yeah. Casey!

The drugs they affect my eyes.

She's big time car thief of America.

Tell her how many cars you steal?

I do not know...

I guess it was one too many.

You want to make more?

Yea.
I need someone like you,

Burt Reynolds, a nobody, but smart.

And someone like you Grease Lightning, 

A nobody, but crazy.

It's time to step up.

What is it? 
Special job. A lot of money.

You in?

Yea we're in.

Hang on wait no. What it is? It is dangerous?

What kind of question is that?

Of course it's dangerous.

Do you want a safe job?

You work in IKEAs, do not question me!

If you do not want, I do not care.

You want to go out there collecting money till you get knifed?

That up to you, I clean the place to like that.

I care about my employees, offer you something better.

You want it?

Yes or no?

I just make it official 
Thank-you.

What?

I just make it official, quit my job.

Now you have no excuses to go on a date with me.

Are you serious?

Completely.

You're crazy.

No, no I'm just a risk taker and you seem worth the risk.

Come on, just one date, that's all I'm asking.

You know we've seen eachother 
every for the last month.

Yes, I have been following you around.
I'm sorry.

We should move in together.

Cool!

I love you!

Hey.
Hey, how are you?

Good how about you?

Good.

126 
You want a beer?

You look cute.

Come here.

What have you been doing?

Missed you. 
Missed you.

So?

So?

I gotta go to work.

I'm not stopping you. 
You are.

Just a little

Maybe I can be late.

Geran.
Haggen.

Well...

How's family? 
Good.

Yours?

I spend more time with horses. 
They don't ask for so much.

Yeh.

What do you ask for, Geran?

What do you ask for from me?

Equil partnership.

I see. 
We've worked together a long time.

A long time.

Never never cheat you. 
Never once.

I take risks.

Oh I know.

You take most of the return.

Of course.

I supply the product. Without which would be nothing.

I accept it. I accept it

Good

Good

157 
From a business point of view Geran.

Why should I give you what you ask me?

From the point of view of justice.

You must appeal to my better nature

That is wrong?

It is little surprise, your pedis more money

No, it's not about the money.

It is society - If

My kind keep us in our place

I know you'll say no, absolutely

I know.

But I needed to know.

I had to hear it.

Geran, the work you do, the risks you take,

They make you deserve at least half of what we earn together.

But the person you are compared to the person I am.

It forces me to reject, to refuse what you ask

It is a question of character, refinement

value, attitudinal

what you do not know anything.

Feel comfortable in your place, Geran.

Fit well in it.

But you never have a society with me,

in any sense of the word.

Look at these people,

They are there, in your little party, 
thinking it would last forever.

Do nothing forever? - Nothing

That is the point.

Let rise, to warm, to have sex.

You look sexy. 
You're so romantic.

I am a very lucky girl. For you.

Because you crazy psychopath alejanste of that shift.

I'm proud of you, Casey Stein.

It worked well

Okay, the challenge is ...

we stay in underwear, we get into the snow ...

walk around the block, naked ...

Can I stay with your socks on? - Do not

Okay, hagasmolo. - Naked ... NOW!

Â¿Quitate all, okay?

It's too cold, I'm going to stay with the boxer.

It's so cold ...!

Lying down ... NOW!

It is very cold....

Won

You're good?

Baby, come

You're good? Jules.

Now we have the blood pressure under control, you must take great care

We must prepare to face the protection clause

Sorry, but I'll be honest.

His status in this country

It does not give them a right to full medical program required

But obviously, are not you refused Hemodialysis, sorry ...

You say you need dialysis?

Yes of course.

Well, lately a kidney transplant is the only solution.

And time is critical, but we can not help you, sorry.

Why do you hide me? - What is the problem?

You listened? I need a transplant and do not give me.

You know, you're everything to me

You can imagine how I feel?

How you feel?

For.

You're good?

Shit, almost they Shot them both.

Burt Reynolds, he returned ...

I knew it.

Come in.

Do not close the door?

You look slow.

You want a woman?

Champangne, cocaine, viagra, take what you want

I just went for the money.

For that we all live, to earn money.

For that, I have horses in Turkey

You know the difference between a career and cabllo a whore?

Me neither. You want to find out?

Bye Bye.

All outside ...

Hagen Kahl, you've heard of him? - Do not

Agree.

He is the number one in this business.

Hagen Kahl Logistic, is completely legal, efficient and reliable

German all that shit.

It has extreme security

Not so legal, everyone watches their actions

Hagen Khal, has an army

Bring a lot of drugs

Which of course is not at all legal

Every six months...

A truck traveling from Rotterdam to Cologne spring.

Each truck load 4,000 cubic feet of golf balls

Filled with cocaine from Chile

The cargo is delivered to the warehouse of Hagen.

Emptying them in stock

Giving it to Geran for distribution

Geran delivers gains 500 euro

You know, easy to transport

Finally Hagen money hidden inside lel

luxury car.

5 million each.

The export in ships, that after returning to Chile

and the cycle is complete

This businessman, Purebred English and German blood

family man, but not the best drug dealer

Do not forget that. - Do not.

Now, the same type drives truck on each trip.

Does not drink or smoke, do not use drugs

no history, very reliable

No sleep for 48 hours

It does not stop to pee

Always on time. It is a psychopath.

As a terminator of driving.

A security camera on the roof of the truck.

GPS

So I need someone like Burt Reynolds

a nobody but ready

And you Chris Ligthning, a nobody but crazy.

If you descrubes like stealing the truck Burt Reynolds, you bring me

Then, you'll earn your money.

250,000 each

Now tell me...

Are you racehorse or a fucking bitch?

JULIETTE and casey

Listen, I think there is a way.

What do you mean?

We return to the United States and paid the transplant ourselves

You do not think I did not think the same?

They are almost 200,000

We can barely pay the rent.

Fails to work on the trailer and I will be what I was doing.

Hare honest money.

Money Honestly?

What you gonna do? Steal all Las Vegas casinos?

A night of glorious chaos?

There is a way to get money. I can do it.

And I can take care of myself too, but no offense.

I did long before I met you.

I go back to work only with Geran, I make real good money then ...

No, Casey.

I do not want to do that for me.

Are you all that I have, okay?

The only thing I try to do is protect you.

Promise you will not.

BOOT PUB

It's okay

Snake bite ...

Two parts of Jack Daniels and tequila part of Tabasco.

Please TPOR this is serious

I'm serious, I worked all week, and it's my day off.

And we've gone over this 100 times. I need a drink.

Yes, but CONCENTRATE two minutes and then we can drink.

I concentrate, tiger's eye.

Then we hit the truck here as we speak ...

What is that? - For real?

The burner is the bike, the cup is the car.

We crashed the bike against the car and make it look like an accident.

When the truck stops, the driver will

And that's our chance - I have it

Okay, I will take the GPS and you take care of the driver

I tell these guys dominate the pressure.

They hit you with the counterattack, always one step ahead.

This year won the League, will be great.

What? I put money in this game.

It was something you said.

I say so many things.

Yes, but mastering the pressure, stay one step adelante'.

We need a counter.

Jules

Ready.

He told me that if you died ...

I have to move on and forget about you.

Well, I can not do this.

That wait for you to die, it is not for us

We have to move, we will do whatever it takes

Let's move on

You have them ?, you have it?

Com'on com'on!

Go Go...

You're good?

We said no guns.

You said no guns

GPS disconnected

connected GPS

Continue on the road and use the GPS.

Â¿Be careful, okay?

The truck has been stolen

They try to escape through the south road

Send the team.

No answer ... no answer ...

What happens friend, where are you? We need to see Geran in an hour.

Call now, I'm in place. Now!

Good morning.

Rarely I meet people like you.

If they try to rob me, I take what's mine, but there is something ...

what I'm very attracted to, I wonder who would be this man?

Who will sent?

I wonder.

What if about you is that you're American, because my friends

They tell me you were talking while you were unconscious

It is typical of an American ...

and judging by your damn refusal to talk now that you are fully aware

I guess that makes you

an American very brave or ...

one too stupid. No, you let me know.

But you and I are confident that we can skip all this boring talk

to Silvester Stallone, you know?

You just give me the name or names of the clowns who sent you

Your idiot boss.

I was ... It was my idea.

I want you to know right now, Lord ...

that at no time have I condemned for what you did

Our line of work, is quite brutal, ruthless rather not?

You and I sitting nuna we would expect, of course not.

We fight to reach the top.

Welcome to the big stupid world in which we all live

But no one gives a shit, because that's how it is, brother.

It always has been and will be until the end

Amen ... Hallelujah ...

Great and brave World!

And...

You....

They dont know anything...

You have to drink enough water to start talking

because your mouth will become very dry from fear, you know?

That's what they told you?

Ah, yes, my father ...

My father was an officer in question quite famous during the war.

A very warm Wednesday afternoon

July 21, 1944, no ...

No, it was in 43

God, I've always hated Wednesdays.

Yes, I remember that was hidden in the coat of my father

I must have been playing hide and seek with my sister, you know?

And suddenly I discovered this briefcase, the briefcase of my father

Full of photographs of the methods of interrogation of my father.

They were horrible, disgusting. My father was sinister, disgusting and evil

and vicious beast.

And he called the sense of duty.

But people who knew him respected him, he was afraid

I hated

After he died, urinate on his grave everywhere

So suddenly I'm your son, but I have not earned their respect.

I hate the pain, hate torture, but ...

I leave that to my friends.

I only thing I do is give the final blow.

The final blow.

Well, I take a flight.

Thank you

I have to attend the birthday party of my wife, you know?

And ah my three beautiful daughters they would severly ...  

CHASTISE ME!!!

You know what women like, don't you?

So I'll leave you in good hands, okay?

Chao!

Oh, one other thing, I noticed your 
wrist band the name Juliette Marne.

They tell me that you were calling
her when you were unconscious.

417 
Leave her out of this. I promise  
she has nothing to do with it.

Americans are extraordinary 
should be all that psychoanalysis.
 
Maybe I should have it, oh am I screwed up for it?

So, finally, if you do not give us the information we need

I'm sure she will.

Auvidesein, my friend

Hey, I've got what you need, wait!

Hello Hello

What's going on?  You're good?

If I'm right, just that I have just the battery.

Where were you last night?

It was home of Matthias

But Casey, you promised me not to come back

Yes, it's not what you think

I was thinking we should leave town for a while

Just you and me, away to take a break.

Look, I saw your letter

Only me...

Do not I need all this lie, okay?

Do you know what today is, right?

Yes, I know, look ...

I go home and ... - No

I can not do this now, okay?

Jules, I'm sorry.

I'll be home soon, please. Just wait for me...

I have to go.

Jules?

He's got a gun. He's got a gun.

Autopista

Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

Listen, listen, I need you to do something for me.

Juliette is in trouble.

What? - She's in trouble.

She's at the hospital, she's heading home.

I need her out of the apartment

say to want to see a movie, whatever!

462  
Movie?  
Why in the Hell is she going to go to the movies with me?

I do not know T, just get her out of the apartment!

Okay, okay, okay.

Hello?

It's like a story Juliette and her Romeo.  

That's William Shakespeare, Brutal.

Many innocent characters of his died violent  
and meaningless deaths like,

Juliette and her Romeo. Poor Casey Stein.

Yeh that's it 12B is so

You can have it back

Tell me where, I'll drop the money, all of it!

Run, little pig, run, run. Run, 
Little pig, run, run, run.

Okay, this is Juliette leave your message!

Jules, com'on you need you to answer your phone!

I'm Sorry, I get that you're mad, 
but I'm begging you please, get out of the house!

I love you so much, just please listen to me okay!

ANSWER THE PHONE!!!

You better talk you bastard!

Hey Geran, yea, I know we messed up.

488 
You sell me out? You sell me out?

No, NO, I did not give you up! 
I didn't say anything.

It went wrong, But I busted out, but I stole a car.

It was one of Hagen's cars drop cars, okay?

It had lots of in it, Lots-a-money!

When you say lots, how much?

It's like $5.000.000 in each car, right?

And Geran look, I need $200,000. The rest is all yours.

But I need you to do something for me.

Do what?

I need you to protect my girlfriend, Juliette Marne.

Okay? She's at Kieser Straser 237 apartment 12b.

Get her out of there. 
Is that all?

Oh, Come on!

Yo this is Matthias. Drop it like it's HOT!

Matthias, I need to know what's goin on. 
Did you get Juliette?

Hey this is Casey, leave a message.

Casey, I do not know how to say 
this man but she was not there.

Just let me know she's is safe.

I think someone got here first. Call me back, okay?

Call me back!

On Three.

[For security reasons we do not accept EUR 500 banknotes]

It's too much? 
You can keep the change, okay? Keep it.

Come on. Come on, you can see I'm in a mess here.

I need your help, I screwed up.

I really screwed this up! 

I was trying to doing the right 
thing for her but it was stupid.

Told her I would not do it again.

I mean she told me, told me not to this and I promised and,

now I might of gotten her killed.

I know you do not know me, but I'm not a bad guy.

But the people chasing me.

They are going to kill the love of my life 
if I do not get to Cologne in time.

Give me that gas and let me drive out of here,

I'll be the luckiest guy alive.

You don't... I probably deserve that too.

I do but she doesn't, Okay?
  
She doesn't deserve any of this.

Thank you! You are a god damn... 

I want to kiss you but I won't, 
you know you are a saint, Thank-you!

Hey, easy!

I do not understand what you saying.

Get down, get down!

I do not understand what you say.

It's okay. Look you do not want to...  
You do not want to get involved with these guys, okay?

Just put it down. Put it down. Please.

You have to get out of here.
Let them go.  

What's your name?

Hey, please stay out of this. 

He has already made his choice. 

Name please?

Wolfgang

Sorry a little louder, I'm a little hard of hearing. 
It is the age, you understand.

My name is Wolfgang

Wolfgang?

You mean after Amadeus Mozart?

Do you speak English, Wolfgang?

Don't play his games, don't.

Please, I'm talking to my friend Wolfgang.

Sorry, Wolfy.

Do you speak the English?

A little bit.

That's good, is very good.

562 
Therefore I will speak slowly.

Do you like Mozart, Wolfgang?

Sure.
Good.

Well, you will be meeting him soon.

Listen I've been hunting deer since I was 12.

and they are five times faster than you.

And I very rarely miss.

And from this range I barely have to aim.

And I'll blow your head from here to DÃ¼sseldorf.

It wasn't a discussion.  

Now it is his time.

The painless coup de gras.

Well.

Obiously I've miss judged you, my friend.

In my experience, people who are about to die, usually cry,

or prays or beg a little.

But laugh a little, well, that is original.

You really are an exceptional young man, arn't you!

You don't see it do you?

No...!

Enlighten me, please.

I mean, you think with all your money, 
you are some how better than me.

That you are safe and in control.

But you are not...

I am in control.

Because still I have your truck.

So you should think about making a deal.


Burt Reynolds 
Did you get her?

Who? 
You know who, Juliette.

Juliette!

No. No. We were too late.
What do you mean you were too late?

Someone got there before us.

She's dead, I am sorry my friend.

I mess with you... I mess with you.

We got her! We got her!
Oh man you're face...

I wish I could see it. She here, relax! She here.

I'm confused. It is there? You got her? She is alive?

My men jsut pick her up, she's on her way.

Come here to race track.

Yeah, okay, I'm on my way. 

Bring the money, okay? 
Yea, I got the money. I got the money.

I have to warn you, 

From what I hear,
She's pretty pissed with you.

Heaven sakes Burt Reynolds!

You give me heart attack!

Next time I shoot you.

Where is she?

Where is she?

You don't see it?

Where, see what?

You Man, you.  
What?

You look like a Burt Reynolds.

Fine, You've got her right? She's here?

Compliment. You're very handsome man.

Well now not so much, gees you know.

Now like manikin.

But then, Alai im, like a statue,
like in 'Deliverance' his body.

You could lite a match off it!

621 
I just need to see her.
I just need to see her.

I love Burt Reynolds
 
Lets walk!

You say anything to Hagen Kahl about me I plan all this?

Nothing.
Nothing?

No, nothing!
And where is she?

Oh, I love this song...

Beautiful...

Hey, Hey, Geran!

No, no, no, no It's me, Burt Reynolds.

Burt Reynolds, what did I say?

No sudden moves.

I'm sorry, Yeh!

Please, the drugs are strong today!

Jesus! 

Traiganla!!!

Geran...  Geran!! 
Yeh!

That's not her!
What?

You got the wrong woman!

Hey stay cool man!
I did as you asked.

I picked her up from Kiser Stracer
237 appartment 12d!

 B!
What?

Appartment 12b

Not D?
No!

Ah... that explains everything that's
why she did not want to come.

Now she can go!
She can go!!!

You stupid ass-hole!

If anything has happened to her I swear I'm going...
DO WHAT?

I ask you, Burt Reynolds
Do What?

Where's the truck?

Tell me where the damn truck is!

No

Oh my god!

Hello?
I believe I have something you want?

Mr. Stein.

Please, please don't hurt her she's nothing to do with this.

Then give me what is mine!
Okay, okay, but...

We do it on my terms we meet 
at the Stiefe Bar in Cologne.

And put her on the phone I 
want to know she is okay.

Oh my god!

Are you okay?

He's here, Hagen is here.

Now the day is over the night is drawing near,

The shadows of the evening steal across the sky. 

What a day it has been Mr. Stain.

What a beautiful day.

I see you brought the money!

Open the case.

Yep, all seems to be in order.

Shut the case.  
Step back.

By the way I hear about her illness,

And your gallant and chivalrous desire to save her life.

I was most moved.

incidentally you're free to go, Miss Marne.

You on the other hand Casey I'll need you to 
stay to sort out this truck business.

Hi, Geran.

I need drink.

Will someone get me a drink before I die of thirst?

Have some.

That's nice!

Now...

You think I loud, brash, disgusting, 

Got no manners? Maybe yes!

But I have do have a heart and 
that heart was sliced two.

When you refused me equal partnership.

I take it you set up this little circus Mr. Stein?
Yea it was me.

So you gave yourself up to save her life.

That is most interesting.  

No, I'm not leave you. 
Look, you've got the money. You've got the money.

Why are you doing this?  

Why? Because I chose to, it's all in the game, Miss Marne.

Call it the Trinity game.

This man said, I am become Death, destroyer of worlds.

That simple.
 
Go! Go!!

Wretches!

Hey ... Stop right there.

What the hell is going on, Casey?

Geran offered me and Matthias money to steal a 
truck from this gangster that had golf balls

full of cocaine in it.

What ?
I wanted the money for you, 

to make you better,

Casey...
it went bad, I got caught and tortured me and

Casey...?
broke out and stole a car, there was 5 million Euros inside.

In there? 
Yea!

Jesus, 
Hey look, I just wanted to give you the life you deserve.

What?

If I stuck a pair of tights over my head 
and robbed a bank you think is was a dumb idea! 

Yea, yes of course, I know! 

713 
But I had to think ssome people 
may think what I did was like... Romantic.

Romantic? 
Yea.  

Well, it's kinda romantic.
Thank-you!

Wait... Wait!

Take the money. I'll find you.  

You'll be okay?
Yes I love you.

I love you.

Cola!

And cherry.

Makes cherry-coke!

723 
My daughter taught me that.

Take this.

In prison, the candy is like gold dust.

726 
I want to make a deal.

With this... how do they call Americans it...?

Rapsheet, you need a miracle.

Hagen Kahl, have heard of him?

730 
It is an outstanding member of the community.

And the biggest drug-lord in Germany.

With powerful allies, they bury such alligations.

I have hard evidence.

Even then he could still walk.

Well this through the door, then the rest, that is up to you.

I'm listening.

The truck travels from the docks in Rotterdam to Cologna,

full of golf balls packed with cocaine from Chile.

It is unloaded in Hagen's depoit and distributed across Germany.

It happens once every six months.

Except, last night the shipment was stolen.

By whom?

You think I'm a amateur?

It doen't matter.

What matters it is ...

Decoy truck.

It's like you said, you have to be 
one step ahead, have a contraataque.

Why in the hell do we need a decoy truck?

01:26:389,786 --> 01:26:43,100
It's insurance, in case of Geran try to 
killing us instead of giving us the money.

Do not forget that.

Where are we going to get a decoy truck?

We'll steal it.

A couple of days before you and 
me empty truck minimum securtiy.

And we put the decoy truck here off the hit point.

And when we finish with the stop...

we swap the trailers.

Simple.
Boom.

I can give you that truck... full of cocaine,

With Hagen Kahl's name of the side of it! 

What makes you think I'll make a deal?

It would be the biggest drug bust Cologna has ever seen. 

The press would love it and...

...your daughter would have a hero for a father.

"HAGEN KHAL The King of Drugs"

Here, this came for you this morning.

CASEY!!!

So as I said...

We all got our reasons for doing crazy things in life,

but Juliette have the operation he needed.

We'll starting a new life together.

I love you.

No one has ever told me that before.

The girls never told you that before?

No, nobody ever.

I love you.

I love you too.

So if the reason is good enough.

If the reason is love,

then maybe it is not so crazy after all.
