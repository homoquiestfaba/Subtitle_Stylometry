Found her outside, Doctor.

She was well along then.
Sally pulled the baby out of her.

The usual.
Never learn, these girls.

They give it all up for a bit
of sweet talk and a few pretty clothes

off some fancy man.

Wouldn't catch me
falling for none of that.

What about the child?

Probably best if it's carried off
with the same fever as her.

It's hungry.

They always are.

Greedy mouths

wanting to be fed
and who has to shoulder the burden?

It's a cross we must bear, Mrs Carney.

You're cold, Doctor,

get you a nip of gin to warm you.

Once it's done,
fetch Sowerberry for the box.

And get that badged and ticketed.
Yes, Mrs Corney.

Fumigate that good dress of her,
get the mud off and I'll take it.

Yes, Mrs Corney.
I'll have that petticoat and all.

She won't need that linen
and lace where she's going.

The baby...

The baby?

A boy.

I want to see him.

Let me see...

He's strong.

I'm going to die, aren't I?

We're all gonna die.

In my purse.

There's a letter.

Send it for me, please?
For the baby, please?

Ain't really my place. Miss.

You must send it.
You must.

He'll come for the child.

Can you tell him,

despite everything,

Agnes never forgot
his kindness and love.

Please, send the letter.
Please.

My son.

My little boy.

All right then, I've scrubbed you in,
now get on with it.

No sneezing, Twist!

Don't do it.
Don't eat it.

I'm hungry!

You and all.

But don't do it.

They'll beat ya.

There! There, Mr Bumble Sir!
In his mouth!

I seed him, Sir!

Thief!
I said, didn't I! I said!

Stealing!
Caught red-handed!

Punish him, Mr Bumble!

For the good of us all!
Punish him, Sir!

I will, Mrs Carney!
I will.

For what we are about to receive,

may the Lord make us truly thankful.

Amen!

Oh, Mr Bumble,
you are such a joker.

You, boy!
You! Back to your place.

What do you want?

Please, Sir.
I want some more.

What did...

What did you say?

I said,

please Sir...

I want some more.

Oliver Twist, Sirs.

I thought it best to bring him to you
to decide what to do with him, Sirs.

I wonder, Bumble, if you are not
failing as a disciplinarian.

Me, Sir?

Only today, under your guard,
a boy stole oakum to eat.

I, I thrashed the boy soundly, Sir.

Blisters, Sir, blisters!
Fresh ones!

There will be no more
filching on my watch.

They must be kept in check!
Spare the rod and spoil the child.

He didn't need to be beaten.

It's not fair.

He's only small.

You dare to speak to the gentlemen?

If we had more food,
we wouldn't need to eat oakum.

He's beyond control!

Do you know what you are, Twist?

You are an ingrate.

Here you stand,

bloated with the sins of pride,
of gluttony, of covetousness

when you should be on your knees,

praying to be forgiven!

God sees thou, Twist.
Amen.

Then he sees you, too.

We are the people who saved you, Twist.

When your own feckless mother
abandoned you at birth

by the simple expedient of dying,

we fed you and clothed you,

taught you your letters, that you might
reap the benefits of your Bible.

Gave you a roof over your head, and...
and this is how you repay us?

She must have been a bad lot.

Not a shred of decency to her.

There's bad blood here, Sir.
And blood will out.

Apologise to us, immediately.

Beg us for forgiveness for...

all that you are.
No!

I won't apologize.

I ain't done nothing wrong.

Get rid of him, Bumble.
He offends my sight!

You will hang, Twist.

You were born for it.

Your neck was made for the noose.
Do you hear me, boy?

You will dance in front
of a baying crowd...

... and then, maybe, you'll be sorry.

Pass the Stilton.

BOY FOR SALE - 5 guineas
Apply Mr MUMBLE

Two guineas.

Two?
He's little.

Then he won't take up much room,
will he?

Five is the price.
Two.

Four.

And that's final. Take it or leave it.

Oliver!

Three.
Two!

Taking the bread out of my mouth.

Follow.

He has a most melancholic countenance,

don't you think?

We can all be melancholic,
Mr Sowerberry, with

husbands urging thrift
upon their households

then spending good money
on workhouse strays.

If you want melancholy, Mr Sowerberry,
look to your poor wife.

He was a bargain, Madam.

He'll be very good for business
with a face like that.

Your poor wife who, because of thrift,

must attend church
with a shameful excuse for an'at!

Whispers and looks, Mr Sowerberry,
I hear them, I see them,

and they sting like a lash, Sir.

I dream of mere melancholy,
Mr Sowerberry. I dream of it.

Melancholy would be a merciful escape

from the deep rut of humiliation and
despair your loyal wife finds herself in

from being required
by thrift to dress as a pauper!

You have many hats...

Forty at the last count.

You can only wear one at a time.

I endure it all, Sir.

The petty counting of hats, the...
The buying of paupers...

I endure it all
out of marital duty, Sir.

I'm worn to a shadow of my former self.

My nerves are shattered,
are they not, Charlotte?

Yes, Missus!
Oh, what does he care?

He cares for nothing
but coffins and bargains!

Never marry, Charlotte, never!

Your heart will be broken
and ground into tiny pieces

by cruel husbands who don't give
two hoots for a lady's sensibilities.

If it would restore
Mrs Sowerberry's wellbeing,

I will lift the embargo on hats.

For one week only.

Well...

You sleep here...

... under the counter.

Charlotte?
Yes, Missus?

No doubt he's crawling with fleas.

Scrub him.
Yes, Missus.

Fetch him the scraps
left down for Tinker.

Yes, Missus.

Boy? Work'us.

I'm talking to you, Work'us.

You want to be careful, Work'us,

when you're sleeping in
with all them coffins.

You want to be careful
of them what's dead, Work'us,

cos they come back to life
when it's dark.

Worms dripping out
of they eye-holes.

Noah!

What d'you think to that then,
Work'us?

My name's not Work'us.

My name's Oliver.

Work'us.

Did you think it was
the dead coming for you?

Yeah, you did.

Near crying, you was.

But it's just me.

Noah?
Coming!

You're under me.
I'm above you.

Understand?

You're scared.
No.

You should be.

What's he doing down there?
I don't know, Missus.

Having a rest, maybe.
Lovely hat, Missus.

Get up.
Stop lazing around.

Come along, Charlotte. Come along.
Yes, Missus.

What's the matter?

Can't you take a joke?
I haven't done anything to you.

Why can't you just leave me alone?

But I don't want to leave you alone!

Poor little orphan.

No mother or father.

Only orphan ain't strictly true,

is it, Work'us?

Cos there must be
a father somewhere.

It's just your mother what's dead,
ain't it?

You don't know anything.
Don't I?

Heard the mister telling the missus.

He got it all off Bumble.

Mother with no wedding ring.

Means you're unwanted, Work'us.

Now, what that makes your mother?

A doxy.

Know what a doxy is?

Lifts her skirt for a few pennies.

Oh, just as well she died.

That's what your mother was.

Just a poxy doxy!

Don't you talk about her!
You don't know!

Shut your mouth about my mother!
He's gone mad!

I never done nothing!

He just went for me!
Get off me, get off!

In there! No! The lid, Charlotte!

Let me out!

Let me out!

Let me out!

Charlotte, fetch Mr Bumble.

Run!

Went for me with a hammer!

Oh, Noah!
I was afeared for my life!

He's a berserker!
Frenzied, he was.

Eyes rolling and foaming at the mouth.

He's gone rather quiet now.

And this is what you feed him?

Then this is not madness, but meat.

Meat, madam! It is a fatal error!

Good gristle heats the blood,

boils the brain in the skull.

A scientifically proven fact.

You have been over-generous.

I hope you're content, Sowerberry!

He doesn't seem to be mad now.
No-one's listening to you, Sir

not now, not ever, not after this.

I've a body beginning to niff

that requires a lined box.

I need that coffin
as a matter of urgency.

He'll slaughter us all!
It'll be me first! With a chisel!

Oh, my poor Noah! My angel!

You will all be safe with me.

I shall give him a whipping
he will never forget.

You hear me in there, Twist?

I'll take the skin off your back!

Release the miscreant.

Gone.

There was only one boy
born in that month

ten years ago, Mr Monks.

Birthed in this very place,
to an Agnes Leeford.

Oliver Twist.

I named the boy myself.

It is considered
I have a great gift with names.

The young girl died
of the childbed fever.

One of our trusties was midwife.

I'll fetch her for you.

I don't remember nothing, Mrs Corney.

Nothing at all?

The boy's mother say anything to you?

Oh, you're about
as much use as a sick headache,

you are. Coughing on us. Get out.

The boy's gone from here now. Ran away.

We nurtured a viper
in our bosom in Oliver Twist, Sir.

Caused a riot, Sir, locally.

Very violent.

Destroyed several coffins
and a splendid hat.

I myself sustained serious injury
to my buttock.

Sitting without several cushions
causes the most terrible hangwish.

No, Sir. Not the ledger, Sir.

Parish property, Sir.

More than my job's
worth to let you take it.

But the boy could be anywhere,

but his sort always
winds up back in trouble.

Mr Bumble and I might hear some news.

Perhaps Sir might like
to leave an address?

All right, me covey? What's the racket?

What?
The racket, covey.

The row. The old salt water.

What's the matter, then?
Nothing.

Hold up, covey, why you dashin'off?

I don't know who you are!
Who I am!

Well, that depends

if you're a beak or a peeler, don't it?

What?

And you obviously ain't
neither of them, is ya?

Jack Hawkins is me given,
though I'm best known

round these parts as the Artful Dodger.

You can call me Dodge.

Oliver Twist.
Just arrived, have yer?

All on yer tod?
My tod?

Your own, Oliver. Tod is on your own.

You is green, ain't ya?

Don't know nothin'about nothin'.

Dirty mare! Why don't you look first?

Might have messed me threads!
Up yours!

Some people, eh, Oliver?
No bleedin'manners.

Got somewhere to stay?
No.

I knows this gent,
a very kindly old soul,

what you might describe
as one of nature's...

philanthropists.

He has a place, it's where I kip.

Might take you in.

Got to be careful.
Being as how this old gent

is so tender-hearted,
all sorts could try their luck.

But I'll do me best for ya

and that's all I can do, ain't it?

Thanks, Dodger.

Dodge.
Come on, mate.

Got you a live one, Fagey.

Hello, my dear.

He don't know what to do with it.

It's a sausage, Oliver. You eat it.

The whole thing?
Green.

Green as a cabbage. Ain't got a clue.

The whole thing, my dear.

What about you?

Do you want to share?

He don't eat 'em. Ain't kosher.

The pig and I
are not boon companions, my dear.

Thank you for the offer though.
Eat, eat.

Look at him, he loves it.

You fill your boots, Nolly.

Nolly?

As in, short for Oliver, ain't it?

Got to have a moniker,
now we're muckers.

Like me being Dodger.

See him?

That's Handles on account of, well...

speaks for itself, don't it?

And that's Pearly,
cos his teeth is knackered.

Show him yer railings, Pearly.

And now you is Nolly.

Didn't you never have a nickname before?

No, never.

What kind of company you been keeping?

No kind of company at all,
by the look of him.

Nancy!

Let her in!

Dodge, sort him a bed.

All right, Spike.
All right, Nance.

A nice woman.

He's taking a right shine to you.

Nancy, my dear.

He wants top whack for these.

Does he indeed? Does he indeed?

Oh, you, what have I said?

Take your hat off when you're eating

or you'll never mix
with the gentry, will ya?

Care of.
Mine.

Who's this, then?
Found him today.

Oliver.
Nolly.

Oliver Nolly? Oliver Nolly?!

That's a funny name, ain't it?

You won't get yourself a girl

if she's going to be called
Mrs Nolly. Will ya?

Well, Oliver Nolly, my name is Nancy.

Do you want a seat, Miss Nancy?
Miss!

You don't call her miss
and give her your seat,

she ain't no miss,
she ain't all posh, she's just Nancy.

You shut up, you!
If wants to call me Miss, he can.

Well, ta ever so, Oliver.

I don't mind if I do...
rest my feet for a moment.

Yeah, you're a bit of a gent, you, hmm?

Very considerate.

More than can be said for this lot.

They're nickel.

Plate.

And I'm paying over the odds as it is,

and that's only because
you and I go back, my dear.

I'm the one
that has to give him these pennies.

You might want to think
about that sometime, my dear.

Right.

Soppy cow.

See you again, Oliver.

Bye, boys!
Bye, Nance!

She's a good'un, is Nance.

Me and her, we're like that.

Bill, stop it,
he ain't got it, let him go.

Bill, stop it, you're choking him!

Get off me! Ah! Give me what's mine!

Stop it.
Put him down or you'll do for him.

You'll swing for murder, Bill.
For him? I should get a medal.

Let go of him.
He'll give you your money.

Just let go.

I don't want to lose my man over this,
do I, darlin'?

Come on, Bill. Bill, let him go.

Bill, let him go. Bill!

You never flamin' learn, do you?

Get the coin.

I'll get it, I'll get it.

What you starin' at?

I'll knock your eyes out your head,
you keep starin'.

Oliver, go back to bed.
I heard you.

I was worried that you were scared.

What were you doing to him?

There ain't nothing
to worry about, Oliver.

No-one's scared. It's a game.

Bit of a laugh.

Ain't it, Fagin? It's a bit of a laugh.

That's right, Nolly, my dear.

I had a bit of pie

lodged in my gullet.

Mr Sikes here was helping me
to shake it loose.

Unorthodox, yes, but effective.

He's still lookin' at me.

What you lookin' at me for?

He's new, Bill!

He don't know.

Brand-new this very day.
How could he know, eh?

Look at the dial on it.

Proper innocent.

Say,'I never saw nothing, Your Honour.'

I never saw nothing, Your Honour.

Do that to me again

and I will drag
your guts out with a hook.

Say it again.

I never saw nothing, Your Honour.

I like you.

Bullseye!

Either you're brave,

or wrong-headed.

Maybe a bit of both, eh?
You coming or you staying?

Are you all right?
Go back to sleep, Nolly.

I know, Ezekiel, I know.

But I must bide my time.

Watch and wait.

God will provide, Ezekiel.

'God will provide.'

Very flash.

You cut a very fine figure, Nolly.

You sure I can keep these, Mr Fagin?

I can't pay you.

Small details, my dear.
Small details.

You've got a lot of handkerchiefs.
Yes,

pretty, ain't they?

Handsome.

Put one in your pocket...

Just for a moment.

In my pocket?
Yes.

See what it feels like
to be a gentleman.

Where's all the others?

They're all out grafting, my dear.

Working.
Doing what?

This and that.

Turning a quid,

earning a crust.

As we all must,

my dear, to put food on the table.

Then, I'll graft too.

Perhaps, my dear, perhaps.

Lookin your pocket.

How'd you do that?

Like many things in life,

Nolly, it's easy when you know how.

Eat, eat, eat, eat.

I have errands to run.

He hit someone with a coffin lid?

Unusual!

Why?

This geezer mouthed off'
gainst his dead mum.

Eats away at him see,

his dead mum, who she was,

never knew her,
he don't even know her name.

But anyone mouths off'gainst her,

he goes bonkers.

Tell yer,

give him a couple of fried eggs,
you get his life story.

My ear holes are throbbin'.

A blabber?
No chance.

Code of the workhouse.

See all, say now,

else someone gets a beating.

He'll keep close, it's all he knows.

A workhouse runaway.

Don't I always spot 'em for yer, Fagey?

Ain't I got the knack?
Oh, you do, Dodger.

You have an unerring instinct.

You have the knack, my dear.

You're going to teach me the graft?
That's right.

What is the graft?

Well, that's what I'm going
to teach you, ain't it?

And I'm the best.

You learn from me, you won't go wrong.

I'm like the bleedin' maestro
of the graft.

Everyone says.

Basic rules are...

Got to have your wits about ya.

Be quick on your feet.

Light with your fingers.

And keep your eyes peeled for marks.

Marks?
Don't ask questions, Nolly,

just watch. There's one.

Asking for it.

Watch and learn.

Anything kicks off,
'ave it on your toes.

My money! Stop that boy!

Grab him!

No, no, not that one, the other boy!

Watch where you're going!

Stop him! Stop him!

Oh, Edward!

They're chasing the wrong boy!

Idiot!!!

First time out and he gets pinched!

Where have they taken him?
Court sessions.

You'd better get down there, Fagin.

Me?
If he peaches on us,

you'll dangle same as me.

Get down there,

at least then we'll have fair warning.

Weren't nothing I could do, Mr Sikes.

Transport him to the colonies.

Who's next?

If you please, Mr Fang, your Honour Sir,

pickpocket.

Took a gentleman's wallet
a mere hour ago.

Name.

Speak up, for the love of God.

What?

He said,'Oliver Twist, Sir.'

Pickpocket. Blight upon our city.

A plague visited on our citizens.

Worse than sewer rats.
It wasn't me.

Oh, who was it, then...

Then you acted alone,

from base and venal instincts.

All that is left for me
to do is to pass sentence.

Prison

or the colonies...

or...

How many have I sent
to the gallows this week?

22. But it's only Tuesday.

Simple. Hanging it is.

Oliver Twist,

you have been found guilty
of the crime of...

Stop!

You have the wrong boy!
You're too late!

I sent ahead!

I came as fast as I could.

That is the wrong boy!
I'm passing sentence, Sir.

And wrong boy or not,

this is a court of law
and justice must be done.

You will be hanged by your neck

until you are dead,

and your mortal remains
shall be left to rot

in the common pit.

May God have mercy
on your vile and miserable soul.

Oliver?

Good, he's awake.

You scared him, Mrs Bedwin.
Am I dead?

Oh, poor boy.
Am I dead? Where am I?

Who are you?
I'm Rose.

And you're not dead, Oliver.
You're alive.

And you're safe now. You're safe.

Mrs Bedwin, how does the boy?

Much better, Sir.
He's got some appetite.

Just about took the pattern
off the plate.

Nice to have my good food appreciated,

that's what I say.

Lizzie will serve your lamb.

I've found some old clothes for Oliver.

Uncle, may I be excused?

I hope you scrubbed behind your ears,
young man,

because I'll be checking.

Now, I brought this for you.

It's a bit big,

but at least it's clean.

It's all right.

It don't hurt.

Let me help you.

These are fiddly, aren't they?

I'm pleased to see
you much recovered, Oliver.

I hope you will continue
to grow stronger.

Thank you, Sir.

And thank you for speaking
for me at the court.

Well, that was nothing.

Mrs Bedwin? Is he cross with me?

No, Mr Brownlow's not cross.
It's just his way,

so don't you mind about him.

He never used to be like that, though.

He was always a proud man but

kind and generous,

and, oh, the music and laughter

that used to be in this house.

But there was a tragedy,

and he's never been the same since,

and I'm here to tell you
that who's worked for him

these 40 years.

Precious little laughter now

and he can't stand to hear the piano.

Oh, he's still kind,

but it's all locked up tight.

Blames himself, you see.

Not a day goes by when
he doesn't curse himself.

What was the tragedy?

The old story, Oliver. Love.

Two people fell in love

and maybe it wasn't approved of,

maybe eyebrows would have been raised,

but to see them together,

plain as day it was real, true love,

and it should have been joyful

and all about weddings and celebrations,

but instead it ended up in heartbreak,
grief, loss...

Why?

Oh, listen to me, gossiping on.

I've said too much for your young ears.

Now,

what shall we have for pudding tonight?

Apple pie or cherry?

Both.

Uncle Robert?

Come on.
Is he really your uncle?

No. I call him that,

but Mr Brownlow's my guardian.

He looked after us,

my sister and I,
because we didn't have any family.

No parents.

Where's your sister?

She's not here.

# Abide with me #

# Fast falls the eventide #

# The darkness deepens #

# Lord with me abide #

# Who like thyself #

# My guide and stay can be #

# Through cloud and sunshine #

# Oh abide with me. #

Rose?

Let's play something cheerful.

Oh, Sir. I'll tell them to stop.
No, no, no, don't.

Rose plays very well, Sir.

She does.

We'll have to fetch him back.
Why?

He didn't peach on us in the court,
he won't peach on us now.

But in front of the Beak, you're scared.

Your voice box is paralysed.

Where he is now, who knows?

If he was square ***,
he could spill.

Sing like a bird.
Well, he won't.

Leave him where he is, Fagin.

He's got a chance. Just let him be.

But the risk,
my dear, the risk is too high.

Well, I don't want no part in it.

You'll do as you're told.

Will I?
You will,

if you don't want to
feel the back of my hand.

Bill, there's no need
for backs of hands,

no need at all. No.

And Nancy, it's all very simple.

You wouldn't have to do
hardly anything at all.

Hardly a thing.

Women.
What can you do?

'Oliver Twist.

'My dear Master Twist,

'should you wish to solve the mystery

'of your sweet sainted mother's identity

'and learn of her flawless character

'and good deeds then
come to Golden Lane today.

'I will be waiting.

'I urge you to tell no-one.

'I remain your faithful servant

'and secret friend.'

I never paid for your book.

What's that?
Well, the day

they charged Oliver with being a thief.

Seems I'm the thief.

And the poor bookseller
would like to be paid.

Mrs Bedwin, would you call for a boy

to take the money round?
Let me take it.

I'm a boy. Please, let me take it.

You?

You've done so much for me.

I'd like to do something to repay you.

Please let me take it.

Oliver!

Nancy.

You look really well, Oliver.
You look smashing.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I had a little bit to drink.

Dutch courage. Make me brave.

What d'you need to be brave for?

You just come round the corner with me

and I'll tell you.
Nancy, I can't.

I'm meeting someone.
No,

you got to come with me.

Nancy?

Are you the secret friend?

You're going to find out
exactly what I am.

Come on, sweetheart.

Get off of me!

Get off of me!
Oh, don't he wriggle!

I hate you, I hate the lot of you!

Get off! Get off of me!

Stop it!

Get off of me!
Right. Oh, letters.

Ain't you gone up in the world, son?

That's it, my boy, jab and weave,

jab and weave, Nolly.

Keep your dukes up, son!

Bill, Bill, Bill, enough! Enough!

Let me out! Let me out of here!

Let me out!

Let me out of here!

I could cosh him, that'd shut him up.

He'll tire soon enough, Bill.

Anyway, who's here to hear?

Let me out of here!
Good work, Nance.

Let me out! Let me out of here!

Let me out, let me out!

Let me out of here!

Get off of me.

Fagin's up to something.

He's got something going on, I know it.

He never went to the bookseller's.

Something must have happened.

He had money in his pocket,

and good clothes on his back.

Just a thief after all.
No, Uncle, not Oliver.

We were taken in by a thief.

Uncle...
Rose, I don't want to hear

another word on the matter!
Not another word!

Out for the count.

Dead to the world.

Here's the boy. Oliver Twist.

What would you have me
do with him,

Mr Monks?

I want him dead.

I want him wiped off
the face of the earth.

Nolly!

Good morning!

Good morning, Mr Monks.

I thought we could
speak more freely here.

I hope you don't find it too squalid.

Squalid?

No, I rather like it.

This is fraying, sir.

I hadn't noticed.
Well, it is.

We could do with some new table linens.

They've not been replaced in,
I don't know how long.

I need to do some
shopping for this house.

Whatever you think best, Mrs Bedwin.

I'll go today.

There's no time like the present.

Might I accompany you, Mrs Bedwin?

If you're going to the haberdasher's?

If you permit, Uncle?

She'll be with me, sir.

After breakfast, then, Miss Rose.

Might I enquire

why you wish the boy to be disposed of?

Is this some new sport

that gentlemen are
pursuing these days, sir?

Oh, Mr Fagin, let's not muddy the waters

with reasons and motives.

Very good, sir.
The issue is clear.

He must hang.

It's easy enough to
get a pauper child hung.

Arrange it so that the boy is caught

in a crime which guarantees the noose.

It may take time.

The right situation,
the right circumstances...

I leave the intricacies to you.

And, of course,
the personal risk to myself is...

I understand, Mr Fagin.

A life such as yours is
not one of leisure

and ease.
A man such as yourself,

harried from place to place, jeered at,

treated with suspicion

and contempt,

you could do with a friend.

I could be that friend.

And when the boy is cold

in a convict's grave,

there will be more of these.

More than you can count.

Do we have a deal?

We do, sir.
Good day, Mr Fagin.

Good day to you, Mr Monks.

And it is an honour and a pleasure

to associate with such a gentleman, sir.

Come on, Nolly. 'Ave your scran.

I brought it over special.

It's a sausage. You love a sausage.

Come on, Nolly,

don't be like this.

I told you, if it kicks off

when you're working,
'ave it on your toes.

I thought you was right behind me,
didn't I?

How was I to know you'd
get grabbed by a Peeler?

Next time, you'll know to run faster.

They were kind to me.

And now they'll think I'm a thief.

They'll think I stole off've 'em!

What you worrying about them for?

Rich people, they expect it.

Got plenty,

more than enough.

We wouldn't get it if we asked for it.

End up starving.

So, we take.

And they won't think nothin' about yer,

cos they'll have forgot about yer.

So do us a favour and
leave it out with the strops

cos you're starting
to give me the royal 'ump.

That's it, mate. Dig in, eh?

Back where you belong.
With your muckers.

Be like that, then!
See if I care!

Edward!

My dearest boy!
Grandfather.

# Bene Israel... #

# Bene Israel... #

Never trust the goyim,

Ezekiel, never!

Mr Monks wants no
blood on his hands,

But as certain as our
people ate bitter herbs,

he will put the same
cravat around my neck

as he would around the boy's.

We must ask ourselves, Ezekiel...

why would a man of means

want the boy dead? Hm?

Why does a man of means, we ask...

Who wears a crested ring,

who carries a cane topped in silver,

whose boots are of
the softest kidskin...

Want a workhouse runaway

to dangle through the trap door?

I smell a mystery, Ezekiel.

If Mr Monks will pay handsomely

to lose Oliver Twist,

then it follows that someone else

will pay handsomely to find him.

We have watched

and we have waited, Ezekiel,

for God to provide, and he has!

I knew there was something
special about young Nolly.

I will keep him from danger

and deliver him safely as his protector.

There will be no blood on these hands,

oh, no, only a crested
ring on my finger.

The only cravat around my neck

will be of finest silk,
and you, Ezekiel...

...you will have a gilded cage!

I was sorry to leave you so suddenly

when you sent me to the court to

plead the pickpocket's case. I

must have gone to the wrong sessions.

And then I received word that

may have helped our search
and I had to pursue it.

I am only sorry I

do not have happier news to return with.

Grandfather, this...

search

has gone on for such a time.

I am concerned about your health.

No, I won't give up.

So long as you are
happy to act on my behalf.

Of course.
You shouldn't even need to ask.

Your compassion

is a standard to which
I constantly aspire.

Would that I had been more
compassionate ten years ago.

We will find Agnes and her child.

I am very proud of you.

Your father would have
been very proud of you.

Fine son for a man to have.

Dodger...

Nolly, my dear?

He shut me in...

and he's taken Nolly.

Let's get us a little drink, Fagin, eh?

Thank you.

Stop picking at yourself,

yeah, or I will give you something
to really bleat about.

There was no call to
put the cosh on Dodger, Bill.

It'll do 'im good.

Death to all judges.

L'Chayim!

Where is young Nolly, then?

Don't you fret about him, he's cushty.

What've you got going on,
then, Fagin?

Nothing.

If that boy was gonna blow on us,

he'd have done it in court.

But you...

had to get him back,

stick him in a cellar, and guard him

like the Crown bleedin' jewels.
Bill, please! Please!

So suspicious and distrustful.

I just wanted to make certain

that the boy wouldn't peach on us.
That's all.

Right.

Then you won't mind if I...

use him for a spot of business, then?

A spot of business?
Drum I've had my eye on.

He'll come in handy. He's little, see.

They can get in anywhere.
I'll go with you Mr Sikes.

I'm handy. Go on. ***.

You want to take the boy with you?

Best way to stop him peaching on us

is to make him one of us, hm?

Unless of course there's some reason

you don't want him
doing what he's meant for?

No, none at all.

Although I would like to see the boy.

To check on his wellbeing.

Out of a genuine
fondness I have for him,

as I do for all my boys, hm?

Oh, yeah.

Come on, then. Get home, Dodge.

Excuse me...

I wonder if you can help us?
We're looking for a boy.

Hear that? She's looking for a boy.

How 'bout me, darlin'? Will I do?
Nah, you stick with me,

I'll sort you right out.
How dare you?!

Oh, I don't fancy yours much,

she's a right old boiler!

I'll have little Missy!
Come along, Miss Rose.

You've got me all sweaty now!
Disgraceful!

Everything up to scratch, is it?

He had a jacket. And now he don't.

And boots. Where are his boots?

You got a drink out of 'em.

Anyhow,

boots make a noise. Bare feet

don't make a whisper.

All right, are you,

Nolly, my dear?
Of course he's all right.

Little 'un here's a scrapper.

Caught him having a row with Dodger,

chucked a plate at him.

He's well able for himself...
Ain't yer, mate?

A little scrapper.

Proper little brawler.

Look at 'im!

Don't even flinch.

Why ain't you scared of me, boy?

I've seen worse than you.

Worse than me, eh?

There ain't no worse than me.

Just ain't.

I am the very worst.

Bill, leave him!

All right, touchy!

I'm just having a laugh.

Right, you seen him.

You can trot off now.

Gonna get me head down for a bit.

Wake us up later, Nance, hm?

Don't go chucking
too much down your neck

and passing out yourself, you hear?

I hear ya.

Moody mare.

Nolly, my dear...

This is very important.

When you go out tonight with Mr Sikes,

you must do exactly what he says.

Hm? Exactly.

Mr Sikes is a most...

intemperate man,

and we all want to see you
again in the morning,

don't we?

Understand, don't you?

Good boy.

Sorry.

I wanted to leave you where you was,

cross my heart I did.

I swear on everything.
I never wanted this.

I know.
You do?

You're not just saying that?

I'll get your shoes cleaned.

Now upstairs with you, and get changed.

I'll send up some hot water for you.

Thank you.

Go on, Miss Rose,
before the master notices.

And you can mind your own, Lizzie!

Miss Rose.

Sir!

My apologies.
I did not mean to make you jump.

I wasn't expecting to see you.

What a pleasant surprise.
The pleasure is all mine.

A walk in the park. Mud.

The delights of nature.

Yes, sir.

Excuse me, I must get changed.

Miss Rose?

Sir?

You do not ask if
my trip was profitable,

if I have any news of
your sister and her child?

Oh, did you...?
Sadly, no.

But we live in hope.

Yes, sir.

I wasn't ***.

I wouldn't want to get you in trouble.

Where would I go?
True enough.

Don't know what's in it.

They said it was mutton, but

it's more likely cat!

It smells nice, anyhow.

What did you get for
yourself today, Rose?

There were a couple of
very pretty pieces of lace.

I couldn't make up my mind.

I'll return tomorrow with Mrs Bedwin.

I would be happy to go with you,
Miss Rose.

I could help you make your selection

of which lace best suits you.

Good idea, Edward!

Mrs Bedwin has enough
to keep her occupied.

Tomorrow then, Miss Rose.

I shall look forward to it.
I would be honoured

to have your company,
Mr Edward, but

I also require some items

particular to a lady's wardrobe and...

I'm sure you appreciate it

would be more seemly for
me to be accompanied by a woman.

Another time.

To you, Grandfather.

To you, Miss Rose.

And to those absent from us,

who, we pray, will return home soon.

Why were you rowing with Dodger?

Weren't his fault,
you know, running away.

It's not that.
What, then?

He told.
Told what?

It was all in the letter.

The letter that got me back here.

I can't read nor write,
Oliver, so I wouldn't know.

It was about my mother.

Saying if I wanted
to find out about her,

I should come and meet someone

who could tell me what she was like.

The only person I told
about her was Dodger,

cos I thought we was friends.

And he told them.

Fagin,

Sikes.

Told them my secret.

You don't tell on friends.

No. You don't.

You never knew her, then?
She died when I was born.

I never knew mine neither.

Don't you wanna find out?
No, I don't.

Not one little bit.

I do.

You wouldn't have said anything,
would you?

You'd have kept it a secret.

I would.

You know what I reckon?

I reckon she was lovely.

And beautiful.

And gentle. That's what I reckon.

And you might not know her,
but she knows you.

She's a star in the sky, darlin'.

That's what she is.

I'd best wake Bill up.

Nancy...

I don't wanna do this.

I don't wanna go anywhere with him.

He'll take care of yer.

And the more useful you are to him,

the better care he'll take.

He ain't a bad man, Oliver.

He's just Bill.

Will we fetch the doctor, Mrs Corney?

What do you want
to go bothering him for?

She coughs blood.

And how do we know she coughs it?

She could've cut her arm
and put the blood on a rag.

Instead she coughs it.

It's a well-known trick
deployed by malingerers.

Anything to avoid work.

Put a poultice on her chest.
She'll be all right.

Don't bother me again.

Bit of a tight squeeze, isn't it, sir?
Oh, it is, madam.

We could be stuck here all night.

Now, if I just... wriggle a bit.

There we are.

Sorry, madam...
Oh, never apologise, sir,

for having an imposing
and masculine frame.

By damn, Bumble,

she is a ripe plum,

and yours for the plucking, sir.

Yours... for the plucking.

If anyone should be going
out to work with Mr Sikes,

ain't Nolly, it's me.

I'm next in line.
Hush, Dodge.

I mean, what's going on here, eh?

I'm bein' passed over, Fagey.

And it ain't right, I'm tellin' yer.

I'm keen. I'm mustard.
Got ambition, ain't I?

And I'm sat here, twiddling my thumbs

like an old woman.

And I'll tell Mr Sikes so,

straight to his face, I will.
Dodger, my dear...

You see if I don't...
Hush!

Now, you get through this,

and let me through the front, hm?

Don't take all night about it.

Move yourself.

Mrs Carney...
No, Sal, it's Molly.

I got a poultice for your chest,

set you to rights.
Mrs Corney...

She ain't to be troubled.

I can't die without telling...

Who's talking about dying?

Try and be a bit cheerful, Sal.

The letter...

The locket...

'Oliver Twist...'

Move.
What...?

It hurts, it hurts...

Shut your mouth or they'll have us...

Hush your mouth or I'll drown ya...

What?

Why are you so antsy?
Sitting up all night?

I'm merely relishing
the peace and quiet, my dear.

So what's different about Nolly, eh?

He's the same as us,

he ain't worth nothing.

Like I said, Dodge.

I'm just enjoying the peace and quiet.

Or I was.

Mrs Carney,

fetch her...

I can only tell her...

Don't fuss so, Sal, please.

Try and go easy.

Courage, Bumble.

Courage!

Faint heart never won fair maid.

Who is it?

It is I,

Bumble.

I was performing
my nightly run to the dormitories,

when I saw your lights.

I...

wondered if all was well.

One moment, Sir...

Madam...

Oh, Mr Bumble...

Madam?

Have you been crying?

I have added sugar,

though I am sure
you are quite sweet enough.

How very gallant you are, Mr Bumble.

My... My dear Mrs Corney,

might you confide
in me the reason why those

delightful eyes of yours
are so dewy with sadness?

I'm most unsuitably attired
to confide in a gentleman.

And if the board should hear

that I received a gentleman
in the intimacy of me rooms,

then they would dismiss me
and I would find myself

cast out to add to my woes.
Madam,

do not upset yourself.

We shall not tell them.

Now,

unburden yourself of your worries.

And be comforted.

Bumble is here.

It is nothing, Sir.

Just the travails that plague
every poor widow

who endures a life of penury and want,

who's friendless and alone,
whose bed is cold and unwelcoming,

whose very existence
is as devoid of love

as a desert is of orchards
and peach trees...

But,'tis nothing, Sir.

Pray, leave me to me foolish tears!

I will do no such thing.

Mrs Carney,

I must confess

you have been much
in my thoughts and now,

every fiber of my being
demands to be heard.

My very soul cries out,

I love you, Mrs Corney!

Oh!
I say I love you!

If you will be Mrs Bumble,

you will never be friendless
and alone again.

The bed shall be
as warm as Sunday beef

and in the desert of your heart,
roses will bloom!

Oh, Mr Bumble!

To be the wife of a Beadle!

Invited to parochial banquets!

It's more than I ever dreamed!

Marry me, Madam,

marry me! I burst with ardour!

Oh, yes, Sir! I am yours!

I have long dreamed of this...

Mrs Corney? It's Molly.

You must come.
Send her away.

I said I wasn't to be disturbed!

I know, Ma'am, but it's Sally.

She's going.

And she insists
on talking to you first.

Oh, Mr Bumble,

perhaps I'd better go and, er...

Do your duty, Madam, do your duty.

Then come back to me

and there will be more of such kisses.

Well?

This had better be good.

We have to be alone.

I can't let no-one else hear my sin.

Right. What is it?

It was in this very room.

A young girl who died

when her baby was born.

There's enough silly girls with babies.

How am I supposed to remember this one?

Her name was Agnes.

And the baby's name

is Oliver Twist.

Oliver Twist?

There was a letter.

What letter?

A letter she asked me to send.

But I never,

and I took something from her.

And I ain't been able
to live with what I done

and I can't die with it.

What did you take from her?

Under my pillow.

You must send the letter Mrs Corney.

Promise me you'll send it,

cos what I done to Oliver Twist

and that young girl,

it has haunted me.

You promise, Mrs Corney?

Oh, I'll see the items reach
the interested parties.

Will God forgive me

and have mercy on me?

How should I know?

Ask him when you see him.

Agnes...

I'm so sorry...

Oh, Bill,

what you done to him?
I ain't done nothin'to him.

Guns and dogs, they had.

Oh! He's been shot? Oh, darlin'!

Oh, yeah, yeah, he's your darlin'.

Give him a cuddle, that's right.

Never mind me,

all night in a bleeding pond.

I told him you'd keep him safe.
I kept him alive!

Hardly, he's covered in blood!

I could've just cracked
his neck and dumped him.

You get him to Fagin.

Then get back here,
bring another bottle.

I'm not your servant!

Do as you're told.

Or else!

With a child in my arms, Bill?

A child in my arms.

Go on,

get going.

Get'im out of'ere.

We are made, Bumble!

We are made.
Made?

The gentleman who came
asking about Oliver Twist,

Mr Monks.

It seems I have found
what he was looking for.

Admire your betrothed
if you please, Sir.

I beg your pardon?
Admire me for the presence of mind

I displayed in getting his address.

Oh and isn't he a sly one?

'The Young Master'indeed.

I will write to him immediately.

Madam, that's a private letter...

If Mr Monks wishes to buy,
then we must know

the value of what we are selling.
If we do not,

we cannot fix a price,

can we, Mr Bumble?

Shot?

He's cold as ice, Fagin,
he needs a bed.

In the eaves.

Right.

All right darlin', you're all right.

Go to work!

Now!

Get the quack, Dodger.

We should search all the markets,
wherever there are children.

Sssh, someone's coming down.

Good morning, Rose.

Thinking of your day's shopping?

Oh, yes!

Gloves and lace and pretty things.

Your shawl, Miss Rose.
Allow me.

It makes me very happy, Rose,
to see you

indulging in all the normal frivolities
of young ladies.

And why should I not, Mr Edward?

I understood from my Grandfather
that you had...

a rather upsetting time with

a street urchin, some ruffian boy?

Upsetting? No, not at all.

As you can see, I am perfectly fine.

I'm very glad to hear it.

Mrs Bedwin, shall we go?
Yes, Miss Rose.

Mr Edward.

Well?

Flesh wound. Superficial.

So he'll live?

Who is to say, the injury is minor,
but the infection...

Well, infection can set in
and turn red blood to green pus,

pink limbs to putrifying stumps

within a day.

Death is a blessed release

from the agony.

He can hear you, you know!

Last one.

Leeches.

I have leeches.

How about a poultice,
to draw away the poison?

Everything you've got. I'll pay.

Should he succomb to infection,

give me first refuse along the cadaver.

I can get a very good price
up the hospital.

Get out!

I'll nurse him.

Can you go and see Bill for me, Fagin?

Tell him I'm staying.
Happy to, my dear.

Bill.

If he dies, Bill...

He is my treasure,

my prize, my reward
for keeping the faith,

and if he dies because of you...

Shut up!

You kicked my dog.

He was provoking me.
You kicked my dog.

Nancy's with the boy,
she wanted you to know.

All right then,

off you go.

Why you still here?
I'm trying to leave.

Well, what's stopping ya?
You are, Bill.

Please,

Bill, let me go.

Seeing as you want to go so much,

let me help you.

Thank you, Bill.

Oh, look at the state of you!

I weren't born to this.

I was meant for better.

When I'm rich,

I won't have to associate
with people like you!

You won't ever be rich, Fagin.

This is all you're ever gonna be,

a fat, stinking,

'orrible little fence
lying in the dirt.

You were meant for better?

Don't make me laugh.

Well, we'll see about that,

won't we, Bill?

Won't we, my dear?

A lady? What sort of lady?

Posh lady. Young.

With a old'un. Her mum, maybe.

What would a nice young lady
want with our Nolly, eh?

Didn't say nothing?

Nah.
Good boy.

Nothing to them, neither.

Get your dinner.

You in, Scraps?
Yeah. Come on.

Nance?

Why don't you come down, Nance?

Sit by the fire?

We've drinks and cards going.

He's got a fever.

Way I see it, Nance,

he'll either die or he'll live.

Ain't nothing you nor no-one else
can do about it.

Anyhow, he's kipping.

So why don't you come down?

Have a laugh, like we used to?

Nancy?

You ain't her favorite no more,
is it Dodge?

Been knocked right off your perch,
my son.

Look at him, all broken-hearted.

He'll be blubbing in a minute,
"Oh, Nancy,

why don't you love me best no more?"

Least I've got my teeth.

What girl's gonna fancy you

with your reeking, rotten mouth?

Got breath like an open grave.

Don't bring it on unless
you can handle it, Pearly.

Nice one Dodge.

Nice.

So sorry to keep you waiting.

And how was your day, Rose?

Did you get everything you needed?

Yes, I did, thank you, Uncle.
It was most enjoyable.

That's curious then,

for Edward visited the same shop,

in the hope of finding you there.

And the haberdasher,

the one with whom you've apparently
spent most of the day,

says you haven't been
to his shop for several months.

Mrs Bedwin, would you carely explain?

Mrs Bedwin is blameless.

I asked her to accompany me.

We have been trying to find Oliver.

What?

I have been looking
and asking questions in the streets,

in the poorer areas of the city, and

and Mrs Bedwin
has been good enough to help me.

He stole from us.
No, he didn't.

He stole and ran away.

And you go looking for him?

Anything could have happened to you!

I have to know

where you are and whom you are with.

You know this!

Sir...

Keeping me safe at home
will not bring my sister back.

Knowing where I am
every minute of the day

will not make Agnes return.

I am doing everything in my power

to bring your sister
and her child home.

Dearest Uncle...

...Agnes is dead.

No.
She was my sister!

She would never have left me

these ten long years without word.
She would not have done that.

Two hearts as one.

You bought us these lockets, Sir.

Two hearts as one,
she would not have left me.

We wore them every day.

Agnes is dead.

And I pray,
I pray we find her child, I do.

But in the meantime,

Oliver is out there
and something happened to him.

I will search for him
and I will not stop

untill know he is safe,
because he is not safe.

And you call him a thief, Sir,
but I know he is not.

And if he ever were
then we can only guess why,

because you didn't see him,
and he had been thrashed, Sir.

Thrashed and beaten
till his back was scarred!

A child!

This and worse happens
to children every single day

and we sit here eating soup!
We just sit here!

Rose, you will make yourself ill.
I am not ill! I'm angry!

I am so angry!

I'm sorry.

Allow me to speak with her,
Grandfather.

You must forgive my outburst, Sir,

it was most ill-judged.

No forgiveness necessary.

Your passion thrilled me.
You thrill me, Rose.

I was wondering

what better use
could be made of that passion.

I beg your pardon, Sir?

Have you ever considered
what will happen to you

when my Grandfather passes away?

This house,

everything in it, will belong to me.

And my sister's child, Sir.
0f course.

But you could be
mistress of this house.

We could live here together,
as man and wife.

There is a...

symmetry, isn't there?

Your sister, my father,

together all those years ago,

and now, you,

me.

They loved each other.

What they were to each other
is not a reason for our marriage.

No, the reason for our marriage

is that I desire it.

Do not keep touching me, Sir,
I cannot endure it!

So...

You'll consider my proposal.

I shall go and tell my Grandfather

you are calmer and contrite.

Oh, just, a... just a curl,

come loose.

You see, Rose,

someone in your position

must learn to endure anything.

I'll take that.

I am the young master, after all?

You are tough, Oliver.

This would've decked
a man bigger than you

and here you are, sitting up.

You'll be dancing on tables tomorrow.

There.

You go to sleep now, yeah?

You'll be here when I wake up?

Well, course I will.

Sleep tight. Sweet dreams.

He'll want checking on
during the night, Fagin.

Fagin?

I'm here.

Is it done?

Not yet.

I said I wanted Oliver Twist dead,

and you agreed to do it.

But the boy still breathes.

Why?

As I told you, Mr Monks,
it will take time.

Neither of us wants to dance

on the end of a rope for murder!
I don't have time.

The situation has changed, Mr Monks?

If you want me
to perform this task for you,

you have to tell me
why it has suddenly become

more urgent?

I'll leave London
in the morning for Mudfog.

There is evidence...
Evidence of what?

You don't need to know any more.

I want the boy disposed of,
I no longer

care how you do it.

I return in two days.

If the boy is not dead,

I will do it myself...

...and you will have no gold.

Who did you spend the evening with?
Bill, put me down!

What you been doing?
I've been nursing the boy!

Don't lie to me!

What you doing back so late?
Who you been seeing?

I keep it clean. Look. Look. Look.

I thought you'd left me.
Thought you'd gone and left me.

I would never do that.

You're my man, ain't ya?

I'm your girl, yeah?

You and me,
we're together for always, yeah?

You ever cross me, Nance...

You ever do anything to betray me,
anything...

Then I swear...

...I'll kill you.

Keep in line,

ungrateful brats.

He arrives tonight.

Then we must prepare ourselves.

I'll do the talking.

What shall I do?

You, Bumble,

you shall be my valiant protector.

And by this evening, Sir,

we will be rich.

Where d'you think you're going, eh?

I was going to see how Oliver is.

He can wait.

No, Bill, I told him
I'd be there when he woke up.

What is it with you and that boy?

I just like him, that's all.

Maybe I should've got shot.

Then you'd be looking after me.

I looked after you plenty, Bill Sikes.

You get enough looking after from me.

Go on then.

What?

Bill?

Do you love me?

Do ya?

You think you can catch me out
cause I'm half-kip?

Do ya, though?

Don't start this now, yeah?

Go on, I'll see ya later.

Don't stay out all hours
like last night.

You're going, Edward?

Simply personal business,
Grandfather, should not take too long.

It's selfish of me,
in pursuing my search,

you were forced
to neglect your own affairs.

I should do more.

What if Agnes were to hear
that you were looking for her?

Time has passed,

she may have forgotten
all that I said.

And if she hasn't?

The risk of her running away again
is simply too high.

I am happy to be
your ambassador in this.

And I know you like
to keep close to Rose.

Edward,

what Rose said last night

about Agnes being dead...

Rose was upset

and I'm sure that she regrets
those words today.

Safe journey.

All right, Nance?

Nance...

Come on, Dodge.

You're early, my dear.

Nolly had a good night,

looking much brighter.

Would you like a bite to eat?
No.

Sorry, don't mean to hurt ya, darlin'.

S'all right.

Tell you what,

take your mind off it,

why don't you tell me about

that house you were staying in.

What was they called again?

Rose,

Mr Brownlow
and Mrs Bedwin.

She looks after them.

The food's lovely.

And their house,

what did the house look like?
There were books.

And a piano.

And the kitchen was really warm.

I mean the outside, darlin'.

In your head,

make like you and me
was walking right up to it.

Alright? Ready to go in.

Does the front door have a colour?

Blue.

Like a dark blue.

And the knocker's
in the shape of a lion.

A lion?

Well, how d'you like that?

Right,

that's it.

All done for now.

I got to run a little errand,
but I'll be back soon.

Leaving already, my dear?

Things to do.

I'll take good care of him
when you've gone.

All right.

Very nice.

Decent.

Misfortune

befell his other suit,

but...

we bought new clothes for the boy.

Oh, yes.

We are poor,

but honourable.

They will be so very grateful

for his return, my dear.

Soon, Ezekiel,

soon.

Deliverance from all this.

It is so close.

Uncle, I said terrible things to you,

things I truly regret. I'm sorry.

You've no need to apologise to me.

Let's not talk of it again,
it's a new day.

Uncle, I would like your permission

to continue looking for Oliver.
Rose!

We could ask someone for help.
The boy is gone!

Why persist in this?
I have to try.

Please?

I will discuss it with Edward
when he returns.

We will ask his advice.

My grandson is very fond of you, Rose.

Yes, Uncle, he...

spoke to me.

He mentioned marriage, but...
Did he?!

Oh, Rose.

You would never want for anything,

ever again.

Sir?

This just came through the door
for you and Miss Rose.

'Dear Mr Brownlow

and Miss Rose.'

Did you have a good journey, Sir?

Shut up, you fool.
Yes, Sir.

You have the items?

I do.

Show them to me.

Oliver,

wake up. Wake up...

I've got something for you.

Listen to me.

I want you to take this. Hide it.

Keep it with ya,
don't tell no-one you've got it.

Anyone comes to ya in the night,
anyone who ain't me,

you stick 'em. Hear me? You stick 'em.

Why? I don't...

I need you to keep shtoom.

Make like you're sleeping,
but anyone comes on ya,

you stick 'em
and you keep on sticking 'em.

Nancy.

Sleep, please.

For me.

I'm going to get you out of here.

I'm going to get you back
to where there's books

and sunshine
coming through the windows.

Sleeping, is he, my dear?

He is.

Nance?

Is everything all right?

No problems with Bill?

Not everything in this life
is about Bill Sikes.

I don't live in his pocket.

Nor no-one else's, neither.

She's changed.

She has.

Won't meet our eyes.

Won't stop and talk.

What does that mean?
'She don't live in Bill's pocket'?

Maybe she has a new fancy man.

Well, women is fickle, Fagey.

She's the only one
who could keep the leash on Bill.

Be the worse for all of us
if she does leave him.

Sikes running mad could ruin it all.

Go after. Light-footed and secret,
my Dodge.

Rose, go back to the carriage.
I will not, Sir.

And please, do not say it again
because I am staying.

No-one.

This is a trick.

Who's there?
You're scaring her.

Hello.

Are you Miss Rose?

I am.

And your name?

I'm Nancy.

Give them to me.

How much?

Pass it to Mr Bumble.

Thank you, Sir,

very generous, Sir.

A half sovereign, Madam.

Not enough.

The items are worthless.

They are of sentimental value only,

shame on you madam, for charging a fee

to restore a family's property.

Worthless?

Why, Mr Monks,

I would not call
this letter worthless.

A young lady,

ward to a rich elderly gentleman
falls in love with his son,

a man who already has a child of his own

and find that she's carrying
that gentleman's child out of wedlock.

It's like something you might see
on the London stage, Sir.

Very gripping, it was.

And ever so sad, so much tragic death.

There's poor young Agnes Leeford

and the father of this baby,
also sadly deceased...

Would he be your own father, Mr Monks?

Or should I call you
by your real name, Edward Brownlow?

Very scandalous.

Seems the rich are as unable

to control themselves as the poor.

Very dirty story.

But sift through the dirt...

...and you find gold.

Is that what's at the bottom
of all this, Sir?

Money?

What a squalid mind you have, Madam.

Squalid it may be,

but I'm never too far off the mark.

I see so much of human life
you see, Sir,

and you look to me
like a man with expectations.

And this young Oliver Twist,

if he were to be found,

would he be sharing
those expectations with you?

Oh, to have your inheritance halved

by a workhouse bastard.

That must cut like a knife.

This letter's far from worthless, Sir.

Give it to me.

Forty guineas and it's yours.

No.

Very good, Sir,

let's haggle ***.
Some friendly ***.

Forty guineas.

I could always send it
to the person it was meant for.

My windpipe!

Give me the letter.
Forty guineas.

Madam!

Give him the letter! I'm choking!

Forty guineas.

Give me the letter,

or I will tear his face off...

...and you can feed it
to your starving orphans.

Forty guineas.

He never run away from ya,

we trapped him, we took him back.

Why haven't you brought
Oliver back to us?

You don't know nothing, do ya?

There's no bargain to be made here.

I will offer a small reward,
that's all.

I'm risking everything

and you think I want a few coins?
Of course not!

We just want to know that Oliver's safe.
He ain't.

You have to help him.

There are those who want him dead.

Dead?

The boy has nothing.
There's a man

called Fagin,

he's to arrange it
for a man called Monks.

Monks?

He's the one that wants Oliver dead.

He's a gentleman, like yourself.

He dresses nicely,
speaks proper. He's got a

red mark going all up
his neck and face there.

Uncle.

No!

No, it can't be.

Don't tell me what it can and can't be!

I tell ya, I heard 'em!

Monks wants Oliver dead.

You're lying.
Why would I lie?

I will take the letter

and both your lives,

and it will mean nothing to me,

I will leave you

in a pool of your own blood

and deny I was ever here.

As a gentleman,

what reason would I have
to visit a workhouse?

So rather than argue

the value of a letter,

value instead...

what your lives are worth.

For in this very minute,

they hang in the balance.

Give me the letter.

That is a clever girl.

No,

not the parish register, Sir.

How will we know
who's been born and who's died?

He's gone to some place called

Mudfog,

he said, for evidence

and when he comes back,
it's to happen.

There's a workhouse at Mudfog.
It was on the list that you gave Edward.

Edward is nothing to do with this!

What you talking about
some Edward for?

Monks is the name.
You're not listening to me!

We are.
He's coming back tomorrow.

Fagin's to have the job done

or this man Monks will do it himself.

I'd bring him to you, but I can't,

you have to go and get him.

Just tell us what to do.

I'll tell you how
to find Fagin's place,

but you have to promise me something.

If I can.

That you go the earliest
light of dawn, because...

There's someone
I have to keep out of it

and I know he'll be with me by then.

I promise.

This is a hoax.

Rose.
He don't believe me,

he ain't going to help Oliver.
He will. I'll talk to him.

How do we find this Fagin's house?

St Giles, Cripplegate,

there's a tanner. Up the stairs.
There's door

with three locks.

You'll find Oliver inside.

I've gotta go now.
If you should need a friend...

Don't go against your word.
We won't.

Thank you, Miss Nancy.

That's what Oliver called me.

He called me 'Miss'.
I won't see him again, now.

You remember me well to him, will ya?

Always.

Always, I promise you.

I said, now, Rose!

Well, it's not forty guineas,

but it's enough for a wedding dress.

I think the money
would be better spent

on a doctor for my injuries,
which are extensive!

I am having doubts

as to whether we will have need
of a wedding dress at all!

Doubts?

You were not wifely, Madam!

I was choked,

my nostrils near torn asunder

and all you cared for
was forty guineas!

Oh, Bumble,

how can you say such things
to your beloved,

of course I was worried
near to death for you.

You did a very fine job
of convincing me otherwise!

He hypnotised me, Sir!

He had the eyes of a snake!
I couldn't look nowhere else,

I swear he's the very devil
and I was terrified,

all I could think of
was being back in your arms.

My heart was hammering, Sir...

Can you feel it, pounding away?

Like a trapped bird, it is...

Go on, feel...

It is pounding, isn't it?

Yes, Madam.

Oh, I'm so weak and silly, Sir.

I am still your little bunny,
aren't I?

Yes, Madam.

And I can still have
the best wedding dress, can't I?

My little bunny must have
whatever she wants.

Bill?

How you can believe a woman like that?

A woman like what?
Isn't it obvious?

A woman of the streets, a prostitute.

Or just poor.

A poor woman
who didn't ask for any reward.

And I do believe her.

My grandson, whom I love and trust,

is not capable of assuming
a false name,

of imagining vile deeds.

The Edward you know
is not the one I know.

Lies. All of it, lies.

Why would a wealthy man
want a child dead?

Because Oliver is Agnes' child!

That's what Edward has discovered.
Oliver is Agnes' child.

He must be.

He has to be.
Why else would it matter so much?

Uncle, you love and trust Edward,
but I do not.

He's threatened to cast me out

if I don't agree to be his wife.

He wouldn't.

You must have misunderstood.
You have to go to this place.

You have to do everything Nancy said

and if she is lying, which she isn't,

but if she is,
then Oliver won't be there,

there won't be a man called Fagin,

no-one will have heard of a Mr Monks

and Edward is innocent.

If that is the case,

if Nancy is lying, then I will never
speak of Oliver again.

And even though he is repugnant to me,
I will marry Edward.

Fagey, it's worse than you reckon!

Ain't no new fancy man.
Dodge!

Nancy's peached!
The peelers will be on us!

Dodger, you must be wrong.
I ain't got it wrong!

She's peached, I tell ya!

Given names! Blown on us.

None too savage, Bill.

I'm sure it can be explained,
this is Nancy!

None too savage!

There you are,

was wondering where you'd got to,
tom-catting around.

Bill...

Bill, listen to me, listen...

I kept you out,

I kept you out.

I kept you out. I swear.

I swear, Bill.

Listen, no, I kept you out.

Please Bill, no!

Don't, don't! No! No! No!

Don't! Don't!

No! No!

What was he doing here?

He was looking for her.

You'll only get a smashing yourself,
Dodge.

I don't care.

Peelers.

Peelers are coming.

We must be swift. Ezekiel.

Get up.

You're all right. Get up.

I warned you.

I warned you enough times
what would happen

if you crossed me.
And what do you go and do?

You can't say I didn't warn you,
cos I did!

That's enough now. Go on. Get up.

It weren't that bad!

You'll be all right.

Get up, Nance.

Nancy?

I'll stick ya!

You come near me and I'll stick ya
so I will!

Going somewhere?

What?

What are you
looking at me like that for?

You keep looking at me like that

and I'll blind ya.

Keep your eyes down.

Walk.

Walk!

We'll get away from London.

Move!

He's not upstairs. He's not here.

He was.

In his bed. All tucked up.

I was keeping him safe.

Perhaps he's killed him already.

Killed him? No,

I weren't never going to harm, not me!

Then what's this, eh?

I never seen that before in my life,
I swear.

I didn't want him hurt,

it was Monks wanted him dead.

Say that again.

It was Monks,
with the red mark on his face!

It was all him, not me. Get him!

Where is Oliver?

Sikes took him.

Where to, I don't know.
If I did, I would tell you.

I want the whole city searched,

every alley, every cellar,

I want this Sikes found.
I was keeping him safe

for you,
I knew you wanted him back,

I even have clothes for him,
under my chair!

I was going to bring him back,
I give you my word!

Your word ain't worth nothing, jew.

Is that your little pet?

My Ezekiel!

Get rid of it.

No...

No!

No! No! No!

Sleep tight, Nance.

Bill Sikes?

Bill Sikes! Bill Sikes!

He's not here.

Yeah, well, looks like he's been here.

Don't.

Let her rest.

His piece.

Look at the state of her.

Go on, up here.

On your feet.
I can't.

I said, on your feet!
I can't, I can't go on,

please, let me go.
I ain't letting you go nowhere.

Are you going to kill me?
I might do!

That depends on you, don't it?
How good you do.

That depends on what?
You're my protection, boy.

You're going to speak for me, see?

What am I supposed to say?
You'll say

that it weren't me what done it.
You'll say

that it couldn't've been me,

not Bill Sikes, cos I weren't...

Cos I weren't nowhere near her.

I was out here, weren't I, with you?

Near who?

Near Nancy?

What's happened to her?
Nothing!

It wasn't me.

That's what you'll say.

It must've been someone else...

Cos I would never lift a hand to her.

You understand me, boy? Never.

There's blood on your face, Mr Sikes.

Bull's-eye!

Dog!

Dog!

No, no, no, no!
You're coming with me!

You're staying with me,

I need you...

Rose! The police!

Did you find him?

It's Nancy.

What?

No, no, no. This way.

Back to London?

Stop asking questions! Move!

I hate the country. Sing something.

Sing what?
Some hymn.

Something outta the church.

Something to keep...

them away.

Sing!

# Abide with me #

# Fast falls the eventide... #

Where is Fagey?
Gone.

Peelers took him.

And us lot is going, too.

This gaff's done for.

Come with us if you want,
but know this...

I'm big potatoes now.

I'm leader.

You're welcome to it.

All right, me blades.
Crack on.

Come on then, boys.
He never had the bottle!

Come on, boys, move it!

The Master and Miss Rose
are in the drawing room, Sir.

Grandfather.
You're returned quickly, Edward.

As I said,
a personal matter speedily concluded.

And satisfactorily, I trust?

Very.

And who are these gentleman?

I hope there is nothing amiss?

And how were things at Mudfog?

Mud...?

No, I know of no such

dismal-sounding place...

You went to Mudfog

for evidence concerning
the true parentage of Oliver Twist.

Do not lie to us, Edward!

Where is it?

Gradfather.
Did you lost your mind?

This is unpardonable!

Unhand me, Sir!
I'll have that, Sir.

Her locket!
No!

Don't make this
difficult for yourself, Sir.

It is her hand.
Hold him.

To Agnes Leeford....

...deceased.

To Agnes Leeford,

a baby boy...

...father unknown,

christened Oliver Twist.

The child we've been searching for.

'My dearest Guardian,

'I write to you in hope.

'My time is very close
and I am penniless.

'I know you are still so very angry
and disappointed in me,

'but I am at your mercy
and I beg you to forgive me,

'if not for my sake,

'then for William's, the son you loved.

'We would have been married

'and I grieve his death every day,

'as I know both you and Edward do.

'I will have William's child very soon

'and even if you are not able
to welcome me home,

'could you find it in your heart

'to take the child into your care?

'I feel such love already
for this little boy or girl,

'so eager to enter the world

'and hope that you might forget
your rage

'and love your grandchild, too.

'And perhaps for Edward,

'meeting his little
half-brother or sister

'may go some way
to healing the loss of his father.

'I miss you and my sweetest
sister Rose so very much.

'Your devoted ward, Agnes Leeford.'

Well, Edward...

What have you to say?

Oh, Grandfather.

They are forgeries.

Liar! Liar!

Miss Rose, no! He's not worth it!

Come with me, Edward.

What extraordinary behaviour.

I may have to reconsider
my intentions to make Rose my wife.

You have no idea

of the web of falsehoods
that I've encountered.

Agnes' locket.
Taken from her body.

There is no limit
to some people's avarice.

And those papers are clearly doctored.

That is why I tried to burn them.
I was trying to protect you

from what is clearly
some iniquitous plot.

And I wouldn't be surprised to learn

that Rose herself is involved.

God Almighty!

Not one word of truth
has come from your mouth!

Everything is known!

You have conspired to murder a child

because he stood in your way.

Because of you,

a brave and honest young woman
has met a savage death.

And you accuse Rose?!

You have blood on your hands, Sir,

have you no shame?

How can I be ashamed, Sir,

when I am innocent?
And still you lie!

I can barely look at you, Edward.

The evil you intended for Oliver

and this is your half-brother!
He is vermin!

He is an illegitimate maggot

who would eat his way
through what is mine.

And at last, we have the truth.

I disown you.

You are no longer
the beneficiary of my will.

You are no longer my heir.

When we find him, and we will find him,

it will all go to Oliver.

You cannot do this! This is mine!

This is my house.
You will leave now

and remain in custody
until a ship sails for the Indies.

You will travel to my holdings.
You will stay there

and never set foot upon
these shores again.

Should you attempt to return,
I will have you arrested.

Grandfather, I beg you...

to reconsider.

Perhaps this is exactly what I needed

to bring me to my senses.

Please, Grandfather, do not disown me!

Pity me...

for my weakness!

You care for no-one but yourself!

Your arrogance and cruelty is repulsive.

You've hidden your true

character from me very well, Edward.

It must have amused you greatly.

I had to do something
to entertain myself

while I was waiting for you to die.

The wait has been in vain.

Goodbye...

Mr Monks.

No tender farewell, Rose?

We will find Oliver.

Whatever it takes,

we will find him.

They feed me

crusts soaked in bacon fat, Dodger.

Bacon!

They laugh at me.

You just got to sit tight,
ain't ya, Fagey?

Grit your teeth. Till you get out.

I need coin, my dear.

For legal representation in the court.
A lawyer.

There must be money.
There ain't none, Fagey.

There ain't nothing to fence.

And I'd get some, but...

These ain't working right, Fagey.

I've lost the knack.

Fagey.

Nancy's dead.

And they killed my bird.

Ezekiel.

My dearest dear

what I raised from the nest.

Are you sure there is no money?
We're potless.

I used the last of it

bribing the screw to get into see ya.

Then the boy, young Nolly.

You must find him for me,

he can vouch for me to the Beak.

He can tell how I fed him, clothed him,

gave him a bed.
Time's up.

He can tell how I showed charity!

You must find him, Dodger!

Nolly is the key!
On my life, Fagey!

I won't let ya down!

# Fast falls the eventide #

# The darkness deepens #

# Lord, with me abide #

# When other helpers fail #

# And comforts flee #

# Help ofthe helpless
Oh, abide with me... #

Go on! Get out of it!

Get gone, I tell ya!

What you looking at?

I'll have yer eyes out!

I'm Bill Sikes!

Nobody looks at me!

I'll have the lot of ya!
Bill Sikes?!

Nolly!

Nolly, wait!
Leave me alone.

You have to help!

I'm sorry for all what happened!
I'm sorry!

We're mukkers, ain't we?

Stick together!

Nolly, please! I promised him!

I have to go.
It's for Fagey!

Members of the jury...

Do you find the defendant,
Fagin the Jew,

guilty or not guilty

of dealing in stolen property,
consorting with known felons

and abduction and conspiracy

to murder a Christian child?

Guilty on all counts.

Prisoner at the bar,

before I pass sentence,

you may make a plea for clemency.

Thank you,

thank you, Mr Fang.

You see,

I never meant no hurt.

I would never have hurt...

I hoped for a reward,

for keeping him safe.

I... I would never have hurt.

You wish for mercy.

I do, Sir,

I do, I...

I don't want to die, Sir.

I don't.
Then ask Christ.

Fall to your knees, before this assembly

and take Christ as your saviour.

Renounce your faith,

your God.

Pray to Christ, Fagin.

I can't do that.

# Abide with me #

# Fast falls the eventide... #

I won't never leave you, Bill.

Ain't it I'm your girl?

Billy...

D'you love me?

I just wanted to say sorry.

Cos I didn't steal of off you.

He's here! Oliver's here!

We've been looking for you,
we've been so worried.

Looking for me?
Yes, for you.

And here you are!

You've come home!

Oh, you've come home.

Mrs Bedwin!

Oh, he's safe!

Hang him! Hang him!

Stop pushing me!

I wanna see him die!

My Dodge...

My dear.

Bull's-eye.

Out of my way!

Goodbye, Agnes.

Goodbye, Nancy.

What are you looking at?!

I'll have your eyes!

Now, the marriage begins in earnest.

Indeed it does.

Days of merriment
and nights of connubial bliss.

Stoke up the fire, husband.

Madam.

Madam?!

It's just a bit of fun, go on,
I won't do it again.

Stoke up the fire.

Bravo!

Encore!

Bravo!

Bravo!

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas, everyone!
