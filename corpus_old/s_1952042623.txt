[Alarm Beeping]

D AY ONE

Come on, Sandy. We gotta go.
I'm up. I'm up.

What time did you
come to bed last night?

I don't know. 2.00 or so.

You need to get more sleep, Charles.

MONTGOMERY COUNTY POLICE CHIEF
CHARLES MOOSE
We had a murder last night in Wheaton.

I told Jacobs to check in.

A domestic dispute?
We don't know.

<i>[Radio Newsman]</i>
<i>How will that affect our weather?</i>

<i>All on our forecast after our look</i>
<i>at Thursday morning traffic.</i>

<i>[Newswoman] A lot of traffic out there,</i>
<i>especially if you're on the Outer Loop...</i>

<i>leaving l-95 College Park</i>
<i>headed toward Silver Spring.</i>

<i>The Beltway out of Oxon Hill</i>
<i>is gridlocked...</i>

<i>with everyone leaving</i>
<i>for the Wilson Bridge.</i>

Did Lieutenant Jacobs have something he
needed to tell you at 2.00 in the morning...

that he couldn't have told you at 8.00?

I've gotta drop you at the airport,
stop by the headquarters...

go to Offcer Murphy's funeral,
get back to the airport for my flight.

You know, I might miss
Jacobs altogether.

<i>[Radio Newswoman] Chesapeake</i>
<i>Bridge and a lot of slow traffic</i> left...

<i>however, on the 95 and 395</i>
<i>between Springfield and Bridge Street.</i>

<i>If you're on your way to work, allow a lot</i>
<i>of extra time and patience this morning.</i>

<i>That's the shape of things</i>
<i>at the moment, Jim. Back to you.</i>

<i>[Jim]</i>
<i>Thanks, Christine. In the Middle East...</i>

Do you realise that
since we moved here, you haven't...

you haven't lost one offcer
in the line of duty?

Yeah, that's one thing
I don't miss about Portland.

Yeah.

<i>[Radio Newsman] The almanac says</i>
<i>the record high in Montgomery County...</i>

<i>for October 3
<i>was way back in 1954.</i>

<i>So how hot can it get?</i>

WHITE FLINT, MARYLAND

Hey. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

[Phone Ringing]
Good morning, Chief.

Good morning, sir.
I'll call you back.

I typed up the notes for your talk with
a couple Post-Its where it reads awkwardly.

Don't worry, Silvia.
My vernacular endears me to people.

Yeah. Paulson.
[Sighs]

<i>[Officers Chattering]</i>

<i>Paulson.</i>
Yes, sir.

You want to talk
about the sergeant's exam?

Ah, no. It can wait, Chief.
I mean...

You got fve minutes.
Come into the sanctum.

<i>[Gunshot]</i>

A man's gotta know his limitations.

I'm not saying don't take the test.
I'm saying give yourself...

<i>[Knocking]</i>
Chief, we have a problem.

ASPEN HILL, MARYLAND

[Quiet Chattering]

DOUG DUNCAN
MONTGOMERY COUNTY EXECUTIVE

Good morning, Mayor Duncan.
Good morning.

?? [Cartoon Soundtrack]

You're gonna miss the bus.
What?

You're gonna miss the bus.
That's okay. I'll ride my bike.

Ride fast.
Milk, honey.

<i>So I miss homeroom, maybe.</i>
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

All right?
Kiss.

<i>Sandwich? Thank you.</i>
Phone?

<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
Come on, Jack.

It's here. It's here.
Thank you.

<i>[Boy] See you later.</i>
<i>Are you in front of the TV?</i>

Is it on? See it?

[TV Newsman]
Witnesses are saying they heard one shot.

One report from a rifle or a handgun.
Yeah, I see it.

A shooting last night.
A second one earlier this morning.

I'm at the third.
I don't know what's going on.

Declared dead by paramedics.
Yeah, I'll meet you downtown.

His name has not been released.

Again, if you are just joining us...

there has been a shooting
at a local Rockville Mobil station.

Yeah, this is Doug Duncan.
I need to talk to the governor.

SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND

<i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>
[Chattering]

Three witnesses heard a shot.

It was a single shot.

One says he saw a white box truck
fleeing the scene, white male driver.

The guy was just fIling his taxi.

Okay. Here's what happens.

Every cop on the street wears a vest.
Mandatory!

I want autopsies on the bodies...
Wheaton, White Flint, Aspen Hill...

done this morning.

I want an offcer
to hand-deliver the slugs...

from the M.E.
To the ballistics lab.

I want results
from the ballistics lab today!

Chief, we've got another one!
Post offce in Silver Spring. That's three.

Four! Four, you count last night.
Damn it!

Wheaton, White Flint,
Aspen Hill, Silver Spring.

What time, Foster?
What?

The Silver Spring shooting. What time?
I don't know. Five minutes ago.

That'd be 8.37.
And our guy here?

8.12.
Twenty-fve minutes.

Look, we need the state police chopper
up over the interstate now.

We need an all-points out
for the box truck!

Chief?
He's using the Beltway.

<i>[Radio Newsman] If you'vejust joined</i>

<i>We're not sure if they're related</i>
<i>or not at this point.</i>

[Siren Wailing]

Stop chewing your face, son.
<i>At 7.40 this morning.</i>

<i>Police are still processing</i>
<i>the crime scenes, and we expect...</i>

KENSINGTON, MARYLAND

<i>[Newswoman]</i>
<i>We're outside Montgomery County</i>
<i>police headquarters...</i>

<i>in Rockville, Maryland...</i>

<i>just moments outside Washington, D.C.,</i>
<i>awaiting some news on these murders.</i>

<i>County executive Doug Duncan</i>
<i>and Chief Charles Moose...</i>

<i>are set to make a statement</i>
<i>in a few moments.</i>

I'm getting 150 state troopers to fII in
the blanks. Two hundred tomorrow.

Governor Glendening has committed
emergency funds. Don't worry about O.T.

I wasn't going to.

What are we looking at?
Hate crimes?

The guy's a world-class misanthrope.
What do you mean?

He shoots men and women,
minority and white. Hates everybody.

Charles, we're not talking
about terrorism?

I don't want to cry terrorist
if this is just some asshole with a scope.

A little panic might make people cautious.
It might save some lives.

There's no such thing as a little panic.
Not any more.

<i>[Reporters Shouting]</i>

The chief looks nervous.
Can you blame him?

The whole nation's watching.
[Shouting Continues]

Nothing like this has ever happened
in Montgomery County.

<i>Our homicide ratejust increased...</i>

by 25º% in one day.

<i>To the people</i>
<i>in the D.C. Metropolitan area...</i>

<i>be advised to be alert,</i>
<i>be vigilant.</i>

<i>There's been no consistency</i>
<i>in the people that have been targeted.</i>

<i>We are not able to assure anyone...</i>

their safety at this time.

Chief, are you exploring
connections to terrorism?

Sir, we are a large...

suburban community,
adjacent to our nation's capital.

<i>We're not gonna rule out</i>
<i>any avenue at this time.</i>

Chief, are we dealing with a professional
of some kind? A trained sniper?

<i>[Moose]</i>
<i>We do have someone that, so far...</i>

<i>has been very accurate</i>
<i>at what they're attempting to do.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Children! Supper!</i>

<i>[Newswoman] This murder spree</i>
<i>began yesterday evening in Maryland...</i>

<i>and continued today</i>
<i>with four more shooting deaths.</i>

<i>Police have launched</i>
<i>a statewide manhunt.</i>

<i>Last night the victim was a 55-year-old</i>
<i>man shot dead at a local market.</i>

<i>At 8.00 this morning, a second man</i>
<i>was shot while mowing a lawn.</i>

<i>A short time later, a cab driver</i>
<i>was killed while filling his taxi</i>
<i>at a Rockville gas station.</i>

<i>Then a woman sitting at a post office...</i>

<i>and then a second woman shot down</i>
<i>while cleaning her car.</i>

<i>Police are urging the public</i>
<i>to remain vigilant and alert.</i>

<i>There seems to be only one correlation</i>
<i>in these shootings...</i>

<i>Every victim was doing the things</i>
<i>each one of us does every day.</i>

Good evening.
Hey. How are y'all doing?

Good, good, good. I was wondering
if we can get a... get a locker.

Would that be a family membership?

Sure. You have month-to-month?

Mm-hmm.
Okay, that'll work.

This your boy?
Yes.

What's your name, baby?
You can tell her.

[Caribbean Accent] My name's John,
ma'am, just like my father.

Where's your island accent?
[Laughs]

His mother's Jamaican.
Oh.

My blood's all red, white and blue.
[Laughs]

Uh, why don't you come on over here?
I'll take your picture.

Come on.
Stand right there.

Oh, come on, baby.
Smile for the camera.

Do you want mine?
Most defnitely. [Laughing]

Now, why don't you give me
one of them smiles?

Okay.

Okay, let me run some things by you.
Right, right, right.

<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>seeing the box truck before</i>
<i>or after Chief Moose announced it?</i>

I'm sorry, but the chief
won't be giving interviews.

All questions can be addressed
through our public information offce.

<i>I'll know better within an hour.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

My offce is getting calls.

Scared people asking questions
I can't answer.

What do they want to know?
They want to know how to be safe.

<i>Asking about instituting curfews.</i>

They've killed at night.
They've killed during the day.

We can't ask a million people
to hide indoors.

We have to defne this, Charles.
<i>[Knocking]</i>

Chief, I've got Sandy.

We have to give it a name.
There is no name for it.

Sandy?
Hey, baby. I'm back. I'm home.

You okay?
Yeah, yeah.

I'll be there as soon as I can.
All right.

Chief! Special Agent Tremain
from the F.B.I.

Baltimore feld offce.

Chief, we open the door to the Feds,
they are gonna ask us to step out.

Don't worry, Jacobs.
I reached out for the Bureau.

[Phone Ringing]
[Chattering]

<i>[Newswoman] This suburban Beltway</i>
<i>community normally offers safe haven...</i>

<i>from the crime and violence</i>
<i>of the District.</i>

<i>But since the last shot rang out</i>
<i>at 9.58 this morning...</i>

<i>Montgomery County police</i>
<i>have announced neither leads...</i>

<i>nor suspects in this series</i>
<i>of random murders.</i>

<i>There are more questions tonight</i>
<i>than there are answers.</i>

<i>Paralysis has set in</i>
<i>across this quiet suburban county.</i>

<i>Citizens are behind locked doors,</i>
<i>wondering if the horror has ended...</i>

<i>as abruptly as it started,</i>
<i>wondering if this is all over...</i>

<i>if it's safe to walk the street,</i>
<i>buy gas or go shopping.</i>

<i>[Radio Newsman]</i>
<i>Has some sleeper cell awakened...</i>

<i>in the shadow of our nation's capital?</i>

<i>Authorities will neither confirm nor deny</i>
<i>that the shootings are terrorist-related.</i>

Terror...

<i>[TVReporter]</i>
<i>You said one shot, Chief.</i>

<i>Are we dealing with a professional</i>
<i>of some kind? A trained sniper?</i>

We do have... someone...

<i>that so far has been very accurate...</i>

<i>at what they're attempting to do.</i>

<i>[Newswoman] The spectre of terrorism</i>
<i>looms large in the mind of Americans...</i>

<i>and it cannot be ignored.</i>

<i>This is Connie Kingston reporting live</i>
<i>from Rockville, Maryland...</i>

<i>a city under siege.</i>

<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

<i>Chief Ramsey had a shooting</i>
<i>in the District last night.</i>

D AY TWO 6.15 A.M.

If it's connected, that's six.

Six people in 24 hours.

AIF AGENT RUSSELL STONE
D.C. Metro turned the bullet fragments
over to us this morning.

The fragments you've recovered
so far have all been.223s.

It's a common bullet. Several companies
make it. Several weapons fre it.

We can't trace it?
You haven't found any shell casings.

We assumed he was collecting them.
Or he's using a bolt-action rifle...

and ejecting the shell casings later,
or he's fring from inside his vehicle.

The shooting in D.C.
Does match the MO.

Long range, one shot, no casings.

D.C. Metro has a witness...

who saw a burgundy-coloured
Chevy Caprice leaving the scene.

African-American driver.

F.B.I. SPECIAL AGENTJACK TREMAIN
I don't think so. Spree killers skew white.

Our profle says he's late 20s,
early 30s, educated, divorced.

<i>That matches yesterday's description...</i>
<i>white box truck, white driver.</i>

We're putting together
a geographic profle.

Most likely,
he lives near where he kills.

He or they? If this is a serial killer,
okay, that's one thing.

But the press has chained this
to anthrax and <i>9/</i> 11.

Long-range assassination is a page
out of Al-Qaeda's playbook.

What if it's not Osama Bin Laden?
What if it's Timothy McVeigh?

We're looking into militia groups
up and down the Seaboard.

<i>We're referencing that</i>
<i>against weapons purchases...</i>

Wait... Wait a minute.

Referencing that against any members
with weapons training.

Lieutenant?

This guy, these guys,
whatever the hell they are...

they haven't targeted government
institutions or employees.

<i>They haven't made any demands.</i>
<i>Nobody's claimed any responsibility.</i>

So if this is terrorism,
what's the point?

What's the message?

Fear.

<i>[Helicopter Approaching]</i>

<i>[Man] Okay, listen. Like I said...</i>
<i>[Woman] Honey...</i>

[Chattering Continues, Indistinct]
[Horn Honking]

Stop worrying, Mom.
<i>[Man] Stay inside.</i>

Oh, yeah. I'll just ride my bike.

MONTGOMERY COUNTY COUNCIL
I couldn't live with myself...

knowing that we might have
done something and did not.

We have done something.
The schools are under lockdown.

It's like living in a bunker
eight hours a day.

Kids are safer in school than out.

Your kids too?
Yes, my kids too. Absolutely.

How do we make an informed
decision about the schools...

<i>without something concrete</i>
<i>from law enforcement?</i>

The chief is giving us everything he can.
Which ain't much.

I propose we shut 'em down.
Close the schools until this is over.

And tell the kids what?
Give up? Hide under your bed?

I'd rather see them scared than dead!
No one wants our children hurt.

It would only be as long as it takes
to catch the bastard.

And how long will that be?

We don't know.
What if we don't catch him?

I guess we'll be looking
for a new police chief.

[TV Newswoman]
The sheriff's department has verifed...

<i>that Montgomery County schools</i>
<i>remained...</i>

<i>under a code blue</i>
<i>lockdown status today.</i>

<i>[Newsman] And there's talk of opening</i>
<i>military bases so local school children...</i>

<i>can carry on with sporting events.</i>

Barring the apprehension of a suspect,
they plan on keeping their children
in this Halloween.

<i>They just don't want to take a chance.</i>

We will release a composite image...

<i>of a white box truck...</i>

<i>seen fleeing</i>
<i>one of the crime scenes.</i>

<i>A white male was seen</i>
<i>driving this vehicle.</i>

<i>[Newswoman]</i>
<i>That was Chief Charles Moose...</i>

<i>speaking to reporters earlier today on</i>
<i>some recent developments in the D. C...</i>

We want you to start wearing a vest.
You gonna put a million vests
on a million people in Montgomery?

No.
Then you're not putting one on me.

I want to assign a security detail
in case... in case...

I'm telling people
to go on with their lives.

Doug, the Feds have intel...
I'm going out in public. My family's...

Al-Qaeda's trained snipers
to hit U.S. Government offcials.

<i>You're the highest elected</i>
<i>officer in the county.</i>

They're killing civilians!
Now! You're a rung up the ladder.

So are you.
I carry a gun.

I'm surrounded
by people carrying guns.

I'm talking about two cops
in street clothes.

Rapid Start collects the tips,
tracks who's working the lead.

Yes, we do. We just can't say it.

Okay. Call me God.

<i>[Phones Ringing]</i>

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>We got a possible. George Lenehan.</i>

<i>He's tied to a militia group...</i>
<i>Brothers of the Cross.</i>
<i>[Moose] The rifle?</i>

Purchased a Bushmaster in 2001,

You gotta see it, John.

You gotta see that. You gotta focus.
Free your mind.

Free your mind.

I told you this 10 times already.

I returned that gun months ago.

[Jacobs On Monitor]
Yeah, I guess a Bushmaster...

<i>would be too much gun</i>
<i>for a skinhead redneck like yourself.</i>

I can handle any weapon you name.

You're a regular shit-head.
Have we found it?

No.

He could have dumped the rifle
in the Potomac, Chief.

<i>[Lenehan]</i>
<i>I guess that's what they told you, huh?</i>

Why would he do that?
He didn't know we were coming.

We haven't had a shooting
since we apprehended him.

Yeah.

Quiet weekend.

<i>[Jacobs On Monitor] You can think</i>
<i>about that a little bit longer...</i>

<i>then we'll come right back in here, or</i>

<i>We've got parents trying to get</i>

<i>home safe and sound.</i>

<i>Police won't comment on any</i>

No. Maybe David Berkowitz.

I said the schools were safe.


He went outside his comfort range

But I redesigned the profle for Virginia,

<i>[Talk Radio Host] Calls are coming in</i>
<i>from not only the East Coast...</i>

<i>States, the Pacific Northwest.</i>

<i>[Woman On Radio] The Towers,</i>
<i>then the anthrax and now this...</i>

<i>Red dots represent the victims.</i>

Red, orange, yellow and green

<i>[Agent] Correct.</i>
The cable cops say he lives
in the vicinity of his crimes.

And then he leaves it.
Hits Virginia.

You say the schools are safe...
Then he proves us wrong.

We're defning his kill zone.

Our victims have all been innocent.

<i>They have all been blameless</i>
<i>and defenceless.</i>

But today...

a line was crossed.

Today...

it got down to the children.

And whether it was
the person we're looking for...

or someone else...

<i>someone so cruel...</i>

<i>so mean-spirited...</i>

<i>to shoot a child...</i>

<i>they've given our community</i>
<i>a level of fear that we're not used to.</i>

Now, come on.

That's crossing the line.

Our children don't deserve this.

I guess it's getting to be
really, really personal now.

<i>So, parents, please engage</i>
<i>your children tonight.</i>

<i>Be there for them.</i>
<i>Tell them that they're safe.</i>

They're gonna need that.
They've got to hear that from you.

<i>And tell them that we're gonna...</i>

carry on.

<i>We will carry on...</i>

<i>because that's what we do</i>
<i>in this country.</i>

That is what we do.

<i>[Newsman]</i>
<i>That, of course, was Chief Moose...</i>

<i>of the Montgomery County</i>
<i>Police Department...</i>

<i>speaking earlier today, emotional...</i>

clearly upset over the shooting of
a 13-year-old boy in suburban Maryland.

Law enforcement offcials are...

I'm supposed to be
all facts and evidence.

I go out there, I shed a tear.

He sees that.

He sees...

He sees he got to me.

He goes out and he does it again.

<i>[Helicopter Passing Overhead]</i>

Detective Paulson...

my sources in Prince George say
that the sniper left a calling card.

You enjoying this?

Bad news is good news,
and good news is bad for business.

The message was on a tarot card.
The death card?

Mmm. What'd it say?

Are there any more cards?

Happy hunting.

[TV Newsman] As we last reported,
the child shot yesterday in Maryland...

at the Benjamin Tasker Middle School
was undergoing surgery...

<i>at Children's Hospital.</i>
Hey, you up?

<i>I'm told he's out of the operating room</i>
<i>after several hours of intense work...</i>

<i>by the county's top surgeons.</i>

<i>But there's been no information</i>

<i>[Newswoman]</i>
<i>And if you'vejust joined us...</i>

<i>there's been a very unsettling</i>

<i>A calling card was left</i>
<i>with the haunting message...</i>

"Hello, Mr Policeman. I am God."
Oh, no.

<i>Sources say that the message</i>
<i>then went on...</i>

to warn the police not to release
the card or its contents to the press.

You have to blame the press

He's the face of this investigation.

<i>The face of the investigation</i>
<i>can't go</i> off <i>half-cocked.</i>

He has every right to give them hell.

Charles, let me do this.
Is everyone on board?

Let me do this conference.
Is everyone on board?

County, state and federal.

You know it has to come from me.

I'm the policeman.

As far as I know,
the people in my community...

have asked the police department
to work this case.

<i>So I beg of the media,</i>
<i>let us do ourjob!</i>

<i>If the community wants you to do it...</i>

<i>they will call today</i>
<i>and we will have a vote.</i>

And if it's decided...

that Channel 9
or the <i>Washington Post...</i>

is going to investigate this case,
so be it.

You need to fII your ain'time
and write your columns...

so you make up news
where there is none.

<i>Each one of you is so hell-bent</i>
<i>on beating the competition...</i>

<i>that you make public information...</i>

that could, at best,
jeopardize the investigation...

or, at worst...

jeopardize lives.

[Truck Horn Honks]

<i>[Man On Bullhorn] We are</i>
<i>conducting a police investigation.</i>

<i>If you are driving a white van</i>
<i>or white truck...</i>

<i>[Newsman] There's a dragnet going on</i>
<i>up and down the Beltway here.</i>

<i>They've got all the off- ramps</i>
<i>and the on-ramps closed</i> off...

<i>and they are checking</i>
<i>all white box trucks.</i>

Open up the back.
<i>Uh, white vans.</i>

<i>There was a report that it</i>
<i>might be a light-coloured Chevy Astro.</i>

<i>Well, today they're taking</i>
<i>no chances whatsoever.</i>

<i>They're stopping any vehicle that even</i>
<i>closely resembles that description...</i>

<i>and they're, of course, asking for</i>
<i>all the identifying papetwork...</i>

<i>I repeat, you want to stay clear</i>

LAW ENFORCEMENT BRIEFING

As of this moment,
we've come up empty-handed.

D AY TEN

<i>[Murmuring]</i>

<i>[Stone] Well, what if... what if we're</i>
<i>talking about more than one here?</i>

Snipers work in two-man teams.
A spotter and a shooter.
We've covered that.

That's not what I'm saying.
Multiple teams.

Maryland has one cell.
One in Virginia.

But you're not answering
the dragnet question.

How the hell do they get away?
<i>Multiple teams, multiple vehicles.</i>

<i>[Jacobs]</i>
<i>So we could be wrong on the truck.</i>

<i>Maybe it's a white van or maybe</i>
<i>it's one of the other vehicles.</i>

<i>We don't really know.</i>

<i>[Newsman] With each</i>
<i>passing day and with each murder...</i>

<i>the sniper or snipers become bolder</i>
<i>and more ruthless...</i>

<i>but law enforcement</i>
<i>is also upping the stakes.</i>

<i>A tally shows that 390 F.B.I. Agents,</i>
<i>155 A. T.F. Agents...</i>

<i>and other government agencies</i>
<i>have now joined the task force...</i>

<i>which has also reached out</i>
<i>to the Pentagon...</i>

<i>requesting access</i>
<i>to a military surveillance plane...</i>

<i>with high-tech equipment capable</i>
<i>of tracking gunfire on the ground.</i>

<i>[TVNewswoman] In an interview,</i>
<i>Senator McCain offered...</i>

supportive words for those terrorized
by the recent spree...

<i>of sniper murders.</i>

<i>He was less supportive</i>
<i>of Chief Charles Moose, saying...</i>

<i>"I've come to the conclusion that we</i>
<i>need to have somebody in charge. "

<i>He went on to say that</i>
<i>with over 1,000 federal agents...</i>

<i>already on the task force...</i>

<i>the person to be in charge,</i>
<i>the person to look to...</i>

[TV Newsman] We've learned that
back in Portland, Moose was criticized...

when protests outside his home over the
closure of the city park turned violent.

<i>As a patrolman, Moose was disciplined</i>
<i>four times for outbursts.</i>

<i>He was ordered to attend</i>
<i>anger-management classes...</i>

to stem his rage.

<i>Despite these incidents,</i>
<i>county executive Doug Duncan...</i>

hired the chief back in 1999.

<i>[Newswoman] The latest sniper victim</i>
<i>was a 53-year-old man, Kenneth Bridges.</i>

<i>Police are said to be working</i>
<i>on a second composite sketch...</i>

<i>of a white van witnesses saw leaving</i>
<i>the scene of this most recent shooting.</i>

<i>Police are also going through hours</i>
<i>of business surveillance cameras...</i>

<i>to find something, anything,</i>
<i>that might lead to a break in the case.</i>

<i>The serial sniper has left eight dead</i>
<i>and two wounded.</i>

<i>The most recent victims</i>
<i>were shot at gas stations...</i>

<i>while filling their cars,</i>
<i>going about their daily lives.</i>

LIGHTHOUSE MISSION
HOMELESS SHELTER

I remember the boy.
He had a gentle manner.

Does this have something to do
with his I.N.S. Hearing?

Or does this have something to do
with John Muhammad?

We might be looking
at a two-man team.

I met John and John at the "Y."

We used to work out together.

His kid was nice, quiet.

He didn't say squat
without John's permission.

I personally found it refreshing...
a kid today showing his old man respect.

John claimed Malvo was his son...
or stepson.

It depended on who
he was talking to.

But that boy,
he never acted like a son.

He followed John like a zealot,
took orders like a soldier.

John Allen Williams,
also known as John Allen Muhammad.

Two years ago he was splitting with
his second wife, kidnapped his kids...

took them to Antigua.

We think that's where he met Malvo.

The boy followed him back
to the States?

Followed him clear across the country.
And back again.

<i>John called the kid "Sniper,"</i>
<i>like a nickname.</i>

I mean, he was teaching him
how to shoot, and I thought...

He taught the kid how to do everything...
how to work out, how to eat right.

The guy's a serial loser.

Two failed marriages,
two failed businesses we know about.

Only time he's distinguished himself
was in the army.

What did he do?

Qualifed as an expert
on the rifle range.

<i>He had these crazy ideas...</i>

talked about blowing up oil tankers
on the highway...

killing cops
who showed up at the scene...

and blowing up the churches
during the cops' funerals.

<i>Sick stuff. Crazy, right?</i>

We got a hit.

Yeah, we got a... It's a Chevy Caprice.
The colour's blue.

Sweet Mary.

That car's been red-flagged
in area one, two, three, four...

No less than 10 times.

Okay. Okay.

We gotta cast a wide net,
but we've gotta do it quiet.

We need every county, state and fed cop
looking for this car.

where are they headed next?

After the shelter, they stayed with a friend
from Muhammad's Gulf War company.

Where?
Tacoma.

<i>[Demeeta] Authorities will</i>

<i>Local F.B.I. Locked down</i>

<i>Firefighters are also working to remove</i>
<i>a pockmarked tree trunk...</i>

been used for target practice.

they have the names too.
