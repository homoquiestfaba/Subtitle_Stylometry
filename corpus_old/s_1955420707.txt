Also interested to know whether you're interested

To go to Sunday school sometimes.

Yes, it's called logic.

My cousin took it.

So how exactly this
teach that life begins?

I think you they're--

Bypass around things?

Yes, it's a little strange, but

Yes to focus on...
No, this is not surprising.

This school is wonderful, do not listen to them.

I think I am capable of
to think for themselves, you know?

Hello, Riki.

It's mine.

Oh, I'm sorry.

<i>And all these women</i>

Practically kidnapped

Streets

Girls kidnapped from their beds -

And then sold to be sex slaves

And it is happening right here in America.

<i>There is a wonderful organization</i>

Called <i> In his hands</i>

So I think

To Kraljevo town needs to be attached

<i>I know Larry wants</i>
<i>to talk to Bob about that</i>

<i>because I think it's a crisis.</i>

A few people talk about the global crisis.

Who would have said.

And then there's the porn.

I saw a show the other night

The entertainment industry for adults

But these girls and boys are
18, 19, 20 years

Are not much older than the children there,

And they get up every morning
i go to work,

And have sex with older men,

<i>every day</i>
<i>daily</i>

<i>on najponiÅ¾ajuci,</i>
<i>terrible, unimaginable way...</i>

No ketchup. - I'll get it, honey.
<i> No, I'll do it.</i>

Are you sure?

Yes.

I do not know, sometimes

I look at our sexual
US state

I know that God is coming.

<i>I do not know anything</i>
<i>o tom, Boni.</i>

I think that for some of these woman

<i>the more economic need</i>
<i>than sex.</i>

I have not followed.

I think for some social problem

Have to see where it arises and

<i>it seems to me that these women</i>
<i>end up in prostitution,</i>

For something else,

Be they economic difficulties

Or lack of opportunities for education.

Or inadequate sex education.

Do not be a democrat with us.

Barbara is printed
those programs for tomorrow?

Yes, I saw them at the office

When I was there before.

Good.

When an event opens tomorrow, yeah?

Well, what were you thinking?

What is wrong with you?

-Men's Nothing wrong with you, Aaron!
Ouch! Jesus!

What's this?
I do not understand.

Think, Aron.

You took something from me.

What, seriously?
It is because of this?

You... you made me feel...

What did I do?

I thought was nice.
It was not nice, it was...

What? What is it?!

It's... it's... it was
nice... it was terrible...

The way you printed

What kind of way, the autumn?

We both do,
it was our decision.

Am I wrong?

Do not uzajedno decide?

Stop!
Stop, please.

Please, stop!

Hey, come ovamo-
Get away from me!

I want to get back to
brother's birthday party.

Stop talking to me.

What are we doing?

I have no idea!

HOW HAS MODELLING ?!

What ?!

Hello.

Hello.

Do you like this?

Yes.

Henri,

I just wanted you to know that...

I'm totally willing to
... fun with you.

If you're serious.

You look really liked

Since we were partners in prayer.

Can I...
to come back to you?

Honey,

Where you been?

I ran down the street for no reason,

He chased me and now I'm back.

Hey.

It's okay...

... Hey.

You want some wine?

Hi, Bob.

Hi, Ricky.

How are you?

I'm fine, I'm fine.

Hey, Kate told me that you're not sure

The situation
companion in the camp.

So I did not know whether...
I mean, if something...

You know, you should sit down next week

I talk about this
what might be best.

OK?

OK.

I think we're all excited and Ricky.

What does it mean?

I'm not sure it's good for him

To go with a companion in the camp.

Oh, why, for what inidenta?

To be sure, I'm not sure
it was suicide

I think the guy liked pills.

I do not know.

A was the incident in
camp last summer.

What happened in
camp last summer?

I thought you-

What are we talking about here?

I think maybe now is not the time.

No no no no, come on.
What happened?

I think that was the situation in the showers.

What situation?

Well, according to a couple of our boys, Ricky...

On the shower with several boys

A
they thought that he looks...

He might have been challenged.

Oh my God.
Yes, but...

Man,

Certainly a lot of stories.

<i>The plane flying</i>
<i>and I was sick .-</i>

<i>Well, when you're in a plane</i>
<i>six and a half hours.</i>

Oh, my God, I cry.

Why?

I do not know... Mom...?

I'm... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

You know, the problem with growing up

<i>This is what has...</i>

Never grow up.

You think you're an adult, your body
peaked,

But you still... grow up.

<i>You really never ready.</i>

<i>You never actually... you're on your way.</i>

Why is this a problem?

Because you have kids.

In the fall, I want you to... izvinim-

No, Mom.
No, I will not. I will.

<i>Look at me.</i>

I want to apologize

If I ever made
to be ashamed of their bodies.

What? What do you mean?

You did not.
No, no, I did.

I'm sorry.

Tell me that's fine.

It's okay.

Listen, autumn
I want to be honest with you.

<i>Something happened to me</i>
<i>in the recent past.</i>

<i>Or, some time ago.</i>

In fact, it was the series...

Something happened to me and...

I'm not sure what will happen to me.

-Bob?
<i>One second!</i>

Riki said.

Can I talk to you for a minute?

<i>Yes, I'm coming right away,</i>

<i>Just to porbinem</i>
<i>for something I forgot.</i>

I need you to tell me
the next time you do it.

That's fine
No, that's not right.

They're a bunch of jerks.

Yes, I do.
I know.

Can not you go through
B wing to the library?

Maybe you should try it.

Yes, I think maybe.

After all, it's the end of the school year.

I think you can.

Hey.

It will be better.

Well, no, seriously!
He will.

I really think it will be better for us.

Hey Grace, have you seen Ricky?
He was looking for me?

No, sorry.

<i>Do you remember when you</i>

Do you remember when I went
i was with Mr. Matthew

When Rosie had some obligations?

Riki was still working in the best shopping,

And she needed help.

Yes, I think I remember.

<i>That was before the</i>
<i>He went to the hospital</i>

<i>on the last cycle</i>
<i>treatment</i>

<i>before you went to school.</i>

Oh, well, yes.

He was very ill,
but not so sick

You can not enjoy...
in the time he had left.

Yes.

<i>At that time, your father</i>

<i>spend more time with him</i>
<i>than I do.</i>

But the road with him...
we are very well socialized.

<i>He was... a real pleasure.</i>

However, at one point, a couple of weeks,

<i>-Mr Matthew -</i>
<i>Can you call him BB.</i>

No, I can not.

<i>One day he looked at me</i>
<i>grinning and said,</i>

"God, you you could be a movie star."

You know, he was a very handsome man

<i>even at the end.</i>

He was.

I think I'm flattered,

You know, I was careless.

Then, he continued to speak,
"God, it's true...".

And in that moment he began to
looking at me...

He started looking at me as if I
worth of attention.

<i>The first nothing happened.</i>

<i>But then you eat.</i>

<i>A couple of times.</i>

Wait.

Do you think...?

Oh, sorry.
No, it's okay.

<i>No, it's not right,</i>
<i>I did not.</i>

Does Dad know?

Yes.

How did that go?

It's not good.

But he's good, I think.

I think.

I do not know, autumn.

What about Rosie?

She does not know.
I will never know.

That's probably for the best.
-Yes.

Do you still love daddy?

<i>I do not think he's gay,</i>
<i>I mean, he's just confused.</i>

Delio's bed with him in the camp
last year, nothing happened.

Well, you've shared a bed with Logan
and nothing happened

But it does not change anything.

Comrade, Logan is not gay.

-Kuper.
What?

I'm not saying that's a bad thing,
I'm just saying that this is obvious.

It's not a good thing,
it is safe.

So, what do you think?

Well,

I think that Christ teaches us to love everyone,

Whether zavisinici,
criminals or gays.

Hate the sin, love the sinner.

Well, yes.

That surprises me.

Why?

I do not know.
I think I...

I think that's all people
immediately realized.

You think because I'm married?

<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>It's not at all the same.</i>

People do not choose your race

The way you choose to be gay.

Hello.
-Hi Dad.

Where have you been?

Oh, we're just talking.

Have you seen Ricky?

Yes.

You could be a little
with your brother, you know!

<i>I</i>
<i>I'll be back!</i>

It will be right back.

How are you?
-Okay.

You?
-I'm fine.

<i>After</i>

If you... yeah, I do not know...

If you want to go back, anyway,

Promise not to run away and scream.

Can you save me?

I can save you.

If you choked you, I would like,
I believe, I believe the...

Me, I
need resuscitation.

Thank you.
-You're welcome.

You're a great savior.
I did, always. It does not matter what.

Hey, Kate, can we talk for a moment
?

Well, I'll try to survive without you.

Okay, thanks a lot, try to...

I'm sorry, gentlemen,
forgive me, gentlemen,

Forgive me, Lord,
forgive me, gentlemen...

Stop.

I think that this is a much
things happening, you know,

Bad influence

Sexual confusion.

Well, comrade, the best we can
is to follow Christ's example.

That's it.

I do not know, it seems to me
this is very urgent.

It seems to me as if...

It seems to me that we are losing a whole generation.

Oh, well, that's what I'm talking about!

What were you doing, honey?

Watching TV.

I do not know why.

This is a beautiful night.

Do you want to leave her alone!
<i>Do whatever you want, Grace!</i>

<i>Thank you, Dad.</i>

What is it?

Well, I'm a little!

Well, I'm going to bring you, Miss Rosie.

Do you all drink alcohol?

Where is Aron went?

I do not know.

Do you know that I love you?

Of course I do.

Oh, thank you, dear.

Do you want some?

No, thank you.

Kathleen

I'm not sure for some of these
Henrijevih comrades.

What?

For those there.

Oh, Heather, and Kristina?

<i>They are very good</i>
<i>Henry's girlfriend.</i>

<i>They are beautiful girls.</i>

A Logan that he is safe
poor, right?

I'm not sure what that means, but-

In fact, I'll do it.
