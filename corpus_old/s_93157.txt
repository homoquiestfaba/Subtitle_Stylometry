enjoy the film... :)
I didn't do it!

I swear to God,
I didn't do it!

Those women were
always good to me.

I'm innocent!

I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!

John, you know me.

I have nothing to do
with any murder.

I'll kill you!

Please.
You must believe me.

Is this the man you saw commit
these terrible murders?

It's all right.
You're safe here.

Jesus loves me.
The devil loves you.

Jesus loves me...

Jesus loves me.
Jesus loves me...

The State of New Hampshire

versus Louis Wagner.

Call your first witness.

The people call
Evan Christenson.

And what did you do
when you got to Smuttynose?

When I got to Smuttynose,
I went up to the house

And went right in.
And what did you see?

I saw my wife
lying on the floor.

Dead or alive?

Evan! Evan!

Evan.

Your mother looked
a little tired.

She can handle it.

If you're not used to having
a five-year-old around...

I thought the whole point
was to get away.

If you're gonna worry
about Billie all weekend...

All right, Thomas.

What?

Nothing.

I'm looking forward
to seeing Rich.

It's been quite a while.

A weekend with my brother...
that's a rare treat.

I'm a photographer
for a magazine.

They're doing an article
about the murders.

My brother-in-law
has a boat,

and I thought he could
take us to Smuttynose Island,

Where the murders happened.
Hey, there...

We left our daughter
with her grandmother.

I thought it would be
sort of a vacation.

Jean, this is Adaline.

Adaline, this is my favorite
sister-in- law.

Favorite and only.
Caught on a technicality.

Rich introduced us
to his new girlfriend.

Hi.
Hi.

I didn't know
he was bringing anyone.

This is my husband, Thomas.
Adaline, wasn't it?

We've met, actually.

Hi. At the writers'
dinner, right?

Yeah.
Oh yeah.

Hey.
Hey. It's been too long.

Where's all this go?

Old man lays down.

Come on,
I'll teach you how to dive.

It was impossible to know
that we had 17 hours left.

Or 12... or three.

This is it?

"...the two women
were discovered in the kitchen,

strangled and bludgeoned
with an axe."

Isn't "bludgeon"
a wonderful word?

One of the best.

Oh, this one's good.
"The nude body of Anethe..."

"An-nette."

"The nude body
of Anethe Christenson

was draped with a cloth
as if the killer could not bear

to look at his handiwork
while he sipped his tea."

Imagine the psychology
of a guy who could sit

and drink tea with two women
he's just bludgeoned.

This must be
the kitchen, right?

Where they found
the bodies.

Yeah, about...

over there and...

here.

Help!

Hello!

Help!

"Although Louis Wagner
was convicted of the murders,

the matter has been debated
for over a century."

I'm working on the "Oswald
'single axe' theory" myself.

Adaline is hoping you might
read something

for us later tonight,
Thomas.

Whatever you're working on,
you know...

we're not critics.

Many poets can turn a phrase,

but most of them
don't have the balls

to tackle
the really great themes.

I'm not sure I even know what
the "really great themes" are.

Abandonment...

Ioss, castration...

That's never gonna be
one of my problems, thankfully.

Chauvinism?

That's tired,
don't you think?

What about Yeats?

The celebration
of the human imagination.

The magician.
Melancholy.

It's all melancholy.

"The room swinging
with emptiness

like an unswung bell."
Valentin Iremonger.

I think
the really great ones

use words in such a way
you can never take them back.

Yeah, they do.

"To separate from life...

from tantalizing mysteries
and salt spray...

from the grave
gypsy eyes...

and the sacred, poignant flesh
of long-limbed dancers,

unsullied,
but not for long."

She's memorized you,
Thomas.

I stole "poignant flesh"

from Rich.

I don't remember saying that.
You were drunk.

I don't think I'd ever
use that word.

That's so like you.

You probably read more
than anybody I've ever met.

But you always pretend
you'd rather be drinking beer

At a Red Sox game.
Depends on who's pitching.

How did Wagner know
the men would be gone?

Sorry. Still thinking
about the murders.

But Louis Wagner...
the man they hanged...

how did he know
the women would be alone?

He's got a 12-mile row
back to shore,

why take time
to drink tea?

And why cover one woman's face
and not the other's?

Axe murderers don't tend to have
the most razor- sharp intellects.

Maybe her eyes were open.
It was the sight of them,

the accusation.

He couldn't stand to have her
looking at him.

So it was an act
of passion.

But using an axe
requires intimacy.

Think about...

how close you have to be
to your victim...

the vibration in your hand,

and the handle as the blade
strikes bone.

The spray of blood
warm on your face,

and standing over her,
her last choking gasps.

If he had gone there
with the intent to murder,

he would've taken a gun.

I think the killer was in love
with one of the women.

And murder was the only way
he could possess her.

I like that.

Wagner... Wagner.

He came into the house.

Wagner?

He took an axe

And he swung it.
Oh God.

God help us.

Anethe...

Is she hurt?

Evan. Evan.

Is she all right?

Maren... Maren?
Evan...!

Is she all right?

Evan! Evan!

It was funny
the way I found out.

Our daughter
was in the hospital.

Jean had...

I guess neither of us
had paid enough attention

to an infection
that she had.

Next thing we knew,
she was barely breathing.

We rushed her
to the hospital.

It was pneumonia.

She was tiny...
she was six weeks old...

and had tubes going in
one end and out the other.

And she was fighting
for every breath.

And I think
in a moment like that,

you feel hope
crossing over into grief.

Nicely put, Thomas.

And they had her in this
fucking box...

an incubator...
and it looked like a coffin.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Then someone from the committee
found me in the hospital.

I got on the phone,
they told me I'd won.

Oh, I didn't have any idea.
I'm sorry.

Of course, Billie's fine now...
tons of trouble.

But it was just so unimportant
to me at the time.

I don't think I know what
it's like to win a Pulitzer.

Love is never as ferocious

as when you think
it's gonna leave you.

Thomas!

What?

Have you done something
with the wine

We're having for dinner?
The wine?

It's almost time to eat.
I've got it right here.

Open it for me, Thomas.
You're the expert.

There was a flesh wound
upon the right forehead,

separating the upper part.

The left ear
was nearly cut through,

separating it
from the head.

In my opinion,
a very heavy instrument

had to make those blows.

An axe,
in all probability.

The only people who knew

the women would be alone
that night

were Emil Ingerbretson...
'cause I asked him

to tell Maren we couldn't
make it back...

and Louis Wagner.

When did you arrive
in America, Mrs. Hontvedt?

I arrived five years ago
with my husband John.

He is a fisherman.

We left our home
because we were told

this is a land
of opportunity.

This is not it, John.

Surely this is not it?

Hello!

Sit...

and have a rest.

We don't have
any money to go back.

We'll make it.

The best cure
for melancholy is industry.

And though the winds
blew for days, neverending,

and the gulls
never ceased their cries,

we drew strength
from the rhythm of our labors.

And from God.

My husband and I grew
accustomed to the solitude.

I didn't mind the work.

I never complained.

I was brought up for this.

The wind carried off
our speech

so we spoke less.

And with work, I suppose,
we had less to say.

It is better
not to take the chance

of asking
an uncomfortable question,

or revealing an affection
for another person

that may bring
unintentioned pain.

It is wiser,
I think,

to keep silent
and preserve the bond.

I knew that I would not
be able to leave the island.

I had to bite my cheek to keep
from breaking into tears,

that once started,
might continue forever.

Can you get me
a drink, please?

Sure.

Adaline...
Shit! Quick.

Shit!

Jesus Christ.
Help!

Can you help?!

Jesus.

Something blew this way.
Here.

Thanks.
And here.

Thanks.

Jesus.

Thanks.

What's all the excitement?

Nothing.

Nicely done.

Hah!

Never get it.

There's a certain poetry
in photography, don't you think?

You know, putting a frame
around the world?

I imagine that's maybe
part of the attraction

between the two of you.

You think so, Thomas?

Makes sense.

I always felt it was more
of an animal attraction myself.

Two strays sniffing
each other in an alley.

You overreached.

I was thinking about
what keeps people together

over the long term.

So how did you two meet?

Thomas introduced us
at the dinner.

I think actually he was
trying to get rid of me,

because I was acting
like a groupie

and asking
too many questions.

Two seconds after I met him,
I was asking him

how he got his scar.

I couldn't help noticing it
in his photograph...

you know, the one in the back
of "The Magdalene Poems"?

Seemed like it would've been
so easy for him to just...

turn away a little
so it didn't show.

But he didn't.

What did he say?

I said...

that I had a car accident
when I was a kid.

The driver was drunk.

I probably read
too much into things,

but I thought it was maybe
something we had in common.

'Cause I put my arm
through a window once.

We need more wine.
Sure.

I'll be right back.

I'll get a towel.

Oh, help!

Anethe!

Anethe!

Please...

Thomas?

Thomas?
Hm-mm?

I don't think he did it.

What?

The murders.
I don't think Wagner did it.

It was the woman,
the survivor... she killed them.

Jean, I just need
a few minutes' sleep.

I can't sleep at all
on this fucking thing.

Maren.

Yes?

John?
What's this?

It's for you.
A little company, I thought.

Do you like him?
Yes.

I like him very much.
Good.

Thank you.

I'm going
to call him "Ringe."

Oh... you have a letter
from home.

Do I?
Yeah.

I thought Evan
would never write.

It's from my sister,
Karen.

Our father has died.

She's coming to America.

She can't.

We have no other bed
and no money for it.

That's all right.

I've been saving some money
for the new schooner.

It's fine.

You're seasick.
Yes, I am a little.

Welcome.

Be careful
with that trunk.

I'm sick from the boat.

I need tea and bread.

Karen...
how is our brother?

He's well.

Is that all?

Hasn't he written you?

We had one letter.

One letter
in all this time?

I'm surprised.

I thought our brother
bore you a special affection.

He's probably busy.

He was not too busy
to be a comfort to me.

He took me on a holiday
over Easter.

And to the theater.
And to supper.

And we stayed in a hotel.

He's prospered
wonderfully.

And put money by.

No doubt he will soon
meet a young woman

to turn his head.

Perhaps he'll come
to America.

Don't be absurd.

A man who prospers
in his own country

has no need to flee.

He's well, though?

And happy?

Oh yes, Maren.

Never better.

We found Karen
a domestic position

early that spring
at the Appledore Island Hotel.

I hoped the work
might occupy her.

Hi.
Hi.

You sleep well?
Yeah.

Guess I'm the last one up.

Hi.
Hi.

I thought we could
call Billie later.

I just did.

Oh.

Oh, you could have
told me.

They were going to the park.
I said you'd call later.

Is she all right?
She misses us.

She said that?

I could tell.

But it doesn't matter.
We're gonna be back tomorrow.

"Hi. We're unable
to take your call right now,

so please leave a message,
and we'll call you back."

Hello, John.

I brought a mate
from Portsmouth

to board with us.

He has some rheumatism,
and it needs nursing sometimes,

But he's a good hand.
It's so cramped as it is.

Come in, Louis.

Louis Wagner, madam.

From Germany?

I hope I won't be
a burden to you.

It's no burden.
What's one more?

Louis, let me show you
your room.

Come.

Sorry to be so stiff.

I'm afraid you will soon
be looking after me

and my rheumatism.

Do you mind
the extra work?

I never mind work.

May I see your hands?

They're strong.
That's good.

Sometimes it helps
to have my joints massaged.

Would you do that
for me?

If my husband
has no objection.

If he doesn't know,
he can have no objection.

They're waiting for you
on the boat.

It's coming on again.
I can feel it.

Would you help me
to the bed?

Please?

Thank you.

All right.
Ease me down, Thomas.

"Dear Mr. Plaisted,

I will be in Portsmouth
on April 15th,

and would very much
appreciate it

if I could meet in your
chambers that afternoon.

Please respond
by return post.

Sincerely,
Mrs. John Hontvedt."

Aren't you hot?

Do you want to swim
or something?

Take a look at this.
Tell me what you think.

What is it?

A letter Maren Hontvedt
wrote to the prosecutor.

What do you think?
Not much to it, is there?

Look at the date.
April 7th, 1875."

That's two years
after the trial.

What reason could Maren have
for meeting the prosecutor then?

Okay, I give.

Louis Wagner
was hanged three weeks

after she wrote
this letter.

Maybe Maren couldn't live
with the guilt

and she wanted to confess
before an innocent man died.

Confess?

I thought you were
snapping a few photographs,

Not re-opening the case.
Aren't you curious?

Yeah.

I want to go back
to the mainland for a few hours,

Iook around
the courthouse in Portsmouth.

Maybe there's a record
of this meeting.

We are running
a little low on wine.

Thomas
is outdoing himself, hmm?

Hey...

you all right?

So I thought...

Never better.

"And in that day they shall
roar against them

like the roaring
of the sea,

and if one look
unto the land,

behold darkness
and sorrow,

and the light is darkened
in the heavens thereof."

You're a good cook.

I'm not.

You're right.
It's dreadful.

I must be a fool
to keep eating it.

I think you are
feeling better.

A miraculous recovery,
I think.

You are
a "sister of mercy."

Are you lonely here?

No.
Of course not.

I have my dog Ringe.

Yes, your dog.

Is he enough?

I have my husband too.

Dog first, husband second...

that is the usual
order of things.

Should keep such observations
to yourself, Mr. Wagner.

I'm lonely too, Mrs. Hontvedt.
That's why I asked.

You're too young to be
a married woman.

John doesn't deserve
such a beautiful wife.

I have made
some konfetkake.

Would you like some?
Konfetkake? I don't think so.

You are the only confection
that interests me.

Perhaps I could have
just a little "taste"?

Mrs. Hontvedt,
don't be offended.

I only tease you.
You've not been teased much.

Am I correct?

You should go.

As you wish.

I would do anything
to have you.

And did the defendant cease
his unwelcome overtures?

He did not.

Women's motives are always
more concealed than men's.

So you think Jean's right
about it being the woman?

It's always the woman.

I can't see a woman
using an axe.

Lizzie Borden?
She was acquitted.

Because 12 men on the jury
couldn't see a woman

using an axe.

Maren must have used an axe
every day chopping wood.

But why would she
kill them?

When a woman kills,
it's generally a spouse.

For obvious reasons.

But her sister
and sister-in-law?

It doesn't make
much sense.

It is remotely possible
they hanged the right guy.

Come on, Rich.
What's the fun in that?

Excuse me,
but aren't you that writer?

Yeah... William S. Burroughs.
A pleasure.

I read "The Magdalene Poems"
for my class.

What'd you make of them?

Good. Really good.
Thomas Janes, right?

What are you
working on now?

An infomercial,
but don't tell anybody.

That's my brother, Rich,
the handsome one.

Can I go to the courthouse
with you?

It's not necessary.

I want to go.

All right.
