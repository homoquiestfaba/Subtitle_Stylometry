STEVE: Smile.
(CAMERA CLICKS)

Got you.

SUSAN: Okay, wait, one
more in front of the house.

STEVE: All right, now.

One, two, three.

(CAMERA CLICKS)

Oh, that's a happy family.
Thanks.

Steve, I can't
thank you enough.

If you hadn't put in a
good word with the elders...

Oh, forget it. The best
part of being a deacon

is doing a favor
for a friend.

No, this is something
special though.

There's even room
for my piano. It's just...

So, now our kids
can hang out, Susan.

Isn't that something?
Another generation.

I know. Tell Nancy
I said hello.

STEVE: Done.

Remember now, we got a pool
and a hot tub out back.

So, you all come over
any time you like,

whether we're home or not.

got a lot of unpacking to do.

You sure you don't
need any help?

No.

If you lug one more
heavy thing around,

you're liable to have
a heart attack.

And then where will
you be when we need you?

Don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere.

See you later.
Bye.

the last one, is it?

Yes. Wait.

I got it. Ready?

One, two, three, drop.

You got it. Okay.

What is this?

What?

That is just loose plaster,

probably from the drywall.

I cannot believe
we're finally here.

I think we're gonna
like it here.

Can you?
You wanna grab that part?

(BELL TOLLING)

How are you?
How are you?

Good to see you.

I'd like you to meet
the pastor, all right?

Pastor Vickers,

I'd like you to meet
Susan and Gary Wilson.

Hello, nice to meet you.
How are you, sir?

STEVE: Just moved in
across the street.

VICKERS: Oh, we're glad to have
you as part of the community.

Well, thank you.
It was a lovely sermon.

VICKERS: Thank you.
We'll see you next week.

Yes, definitely.

Good word this morning.
Thank you very much.

Listen, uh, Gary and Susan,

I'd like you to meet
Jack and Mary Bennett.

They just moved in a couple
months before you.

It's nice to meet you.

And I've already got Jack
signed up

on the building committee,

but Mary,
I'm still working on.

Well, you're wasting
your time.

I got a baby at home.

There aren't enough hours
in a day.

Well, the parenting class
sounds interesting.

You know, uh, that's
really just for folks

with really young kids.

I think they're
already full, but...

Nice to meet you.

I'm hoping you're gonna work
with the teen group.

Susan? Welcome to
our church.

SUSAN: Hey, Nancy.

Oh, my goodness,
look at you.

You are just as pretty as you
were back in high school.

You have not changed a bit.

thank you very much.

Wouldn't it be great if Susan helped
with the teen group, sweetheart?

Oh, absolutely.
It'll be so much fun.

And, you know what?
Steve can really use a backup.

I mean, between all
his committees and the farm,

he's barely ever home.

How many committees
are you on, Steve?

Oh, it's nothing.
I enjoy it.

Don't you let him
pressure you, though, Susan,

if you're too busy.

No, the teen group sounds
like fun. I'd like that.

Now, listen. They're having their
big labor day game this afternoon.

And, you know, Orin could
play on Kris' team.

Right, absolutely.
Okay.

Why don't you all come?
We will.

All right.
Lovely to see you.

Very good to see you.
Let's go, guys.

Bye, now.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Safe!

Joanne, you're looking
bright and happy today.

Oh, thank you.
What can I get you?

Hot dog.
All right.

Is that Chanel No. 5
you're wearing?

You amaze me, Steve.

is hot dogs and fries.

Your grandson is playing
a great game today.

He's a shoo-in
for all-star.

We've got
our fingers crossed.

Kris is looking
good today.

Yeah, I've been
working with him.

Is your son
on the team, too?

Yeah.

Right out there.

And dying of embarrassment
in center field.

It don't mean a thing, Susan.
Anybody can make an error.

Listen, Joanne, don't you
run with some of the girls?

Yeah. Tisha and Mary.
We jog a few times a week.

Aren't you looking for
somebody to run with, Susan?

I am, actually, yes.

Well, we meet at the levee around 8:30
after we drop the kids off at school.

You're welcome to join us.

Well, thank you.
Great.

Oh, and thanks for helping
James with our fence.

I really appreciate it.

Oh, it's nothing. Nothing.

She's married to one of the
elders, James Biggs. Great couple.

Yeah, she seems nice.

Working here is great for
getting to know everybody.

You've got a customer.

Amber Henson.
I love your new hairdo.

You look like
a movie star.

I did too lose the game.

If I hadn't missed that fly
ball, then we would have won.

SUSAN: What about all the
other good plays you had?

They only remember
the last one.


Sorry, I didn't mean to
startle you. You got a minute?

Sure. What's on
your mind?

Uh, Kris wants to know if
Orin can spend the night.

You got a pretty good swing
there, Orin. ORIN: Thanks.

So, what do you say?
Yeah, I suppose so.

You'll be sure to monitor
their TV time, though, right?

Sure.

Kris says you folks
don't have cable.

You know, they're running
a big special now.

It's okay. We don't need it
right now. Thank you, though.

Thanks for all
your help, Susan.

Thank you, Steve.
It was a lot of fun.

Bye-bye.

So, I'm meeting Joanne Biggs
and a couple of the other women

for a run tomorrow.

Yeah, I hope I can
keep up with them.

You think?

Hey.

How about one of
your famous back rubs?

Please.

For you?
Yeah.


All right.

So, you're making
friends already. Yeah.

Well, Steve set it up,
actually.

And, you know,
you're right.

We are gonna be
so happy here.

Well, that's good, considering
we've moved in and all.

(BOTH LAUGH)
No, it's great.

It's great.
For Orin, and for Emily.

This is perfect.

I know what you mean.

Remind me I said that when
the roof starts to leak.


(SUSAN SIGHS)

MARY: So, you never lived on
your own, not even for a day?

No. I loved living
with my parents.

You know, there was
no reason to leave.

I had my own apartment
before I married Wayne.

It was fun, but now I like
having someone to come home to.

(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

(HORN HONKS)

Steve.

Set your watch by him.

Oh, he's headed out
to the farm.

Didn't you know him way back when,
before I moved out here, Susan?

Yeah, I went to school
with him and Nancy,

back in Starkville,
Mississippi.

Is it true he and Nancy
were high-school sweethearts?

Yeah.

We kind of thought Steve was
out of his league... (ALL LAUGH)

Because she was
such a brain.

But, he was really
persistent.

I mean, he sent her flowers every
day until she started dating him.

I've known them
going on 10 years now,

and she just amazes me.

She supports that family while
Steve gets that farm on its feet.

Here.

Y'all! Y'all!

I hate it here.

All the kids have their
own little cliques

and no one's looking
for new members.

We just moved here
a month ago, Em.

It takes time to make
new friends.

It's not gonna
happen here. I know it.

Hey.

Sure it will.

I know just how
you feel.

I felt the same way
when I was your age.

You're gonna do
just fine.

Okay? Believe me.

You're just too special.


Okay?

(PLAYING PIANO)

(PLAYING STOPS)

It's just Mr. Glover,
sweetie. It's okay.

What are you doing out there?

I was just
about to knock.

Listen,
Nancy's working late.

I'm gonna go downtown and meet her
for supper. I need a big favor.

Could you feed the boys?

Oh, sure, uh,

if they don't mind red beans and
rice, I'll set two more plates.

Great. Thank you.

By the way, Emily, have you
tried out for any sports?

You know, it's a great way to
get involved and make friends.

No, sir.


You remind me so much of your
mother at your age, sweet but shy.

(HORN HONKING)

Daddy!

Well... There he is.

Just send the boys over.
Sure.

Emily started to open up
earlier today,

and then Steve dropped by and
made her all self-conscious.

How?

Just talking to her about how she's
sweet and shy like her mother.

And what did she tell you?

She misses her old school, she's
having problems making new friends.

Yeah. Well, it always
takes a little time.

Yeah, that's what
I told her.

But when you're her age,

time is warped, you know?

Waiting for someone to call
you could feel like 100 years.


You know, it's good you're
working with the teen group.

Maybe we should
invite them all over.

Might help her out
a little bit.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

STEVE: Smile now.
That's nice.

One, two, three.

(CAMERA CLICKS)
Aw, that's a nice one.

That's a real nice one.

I just love your parenting class,
Pastor Vickers, I hope you do it again.

Oh.
Oh, that would be great.

I would have joined
if it weren't so full.

Well, we'd always make room for you,
Susan. We never turn anyone away.

Oh, I was under
the impression

that it was for people
with younger kids.

Oh, no. It's for anybody
who's interested.

Uh. Hey, Steve, I think you had the
wrong idea about that parenting class.

Oh, well, I must
have confused it

with something else.

You know, we always have great
classes going on around here.

I wish I had time
to take them all.

STEVE: Well, Tish?

(CAMERA CLICKS)

You need to make time.

I got to go back,
check up on Nancy.

Here you go.

By the way, you're all welcome
to stop by and jump in the hot tub

when you're through here.
Night's still young.

Are you sure
Nancy's up to it?

Well, she's still in bed,
but she won't mind.

Is she sick? She's got that
little cold that's going around,

but if everybody came by,
probably cheer her up.

Bless her heart.

Hi. Come on in.

Um, I brought your mother
some chicken soup.

Uh, yes, ma'am.
She's just back there.

Thank you.

Nancy?

(KNOCKS ON DOOR)
It's Susan Wilson.

NANCY: Come in.

Hey.

Steve said you weren't
feeling well.

Oh, it's only a cold.

But, of course, Steve
insists that I stay in bed.

I mean, that's why
this place is such a mess.

Oh, forget it.

Um, I brought you
some chicken soup.

Oh, thank you.

I just had a sandwich,

so would you mind if I just
saved it for later?

No. No, of course not.

Great.

Well, thank you again.

You're welcome. Um, I'll
just leave it in the kitchen.

That would be great.
Okay.

Okay.

Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

Hey. How did your
mission of mercy go?

Not exactly like
I expected, but...

Nancy must be really sick.
Their house is in chaos.

Hey, hey, hey, girl.

Hi.

What's this?

What's it look like?
A healthy pear tree.

But, uh, why?

A housewarming present.

A little late, but it's the
thought that counts, right?

I did a little weeding in the back,
too. It was looking a little ragged.

Oh, Steve, Gary would have
taken care of that.

Oh, he's got enough on his plate
as it is. It's the least I can do.

It's never the least
you can do.

It's always
way too much.

You don't like the tree?
No. The tree is great.

But...
But, what?

Now Gary can spend the weekend
with you and the kids,

instead of the weedwacker.

Well, thank you, then.
All right.

Wouldn't say no to
a tall glass of lemonade.

Forget lemonade.

You're coming for lunch
after what you did.

I'm gonna take these in and get
cleaned up. I'll see you later.

Great.
Okay.

I'll come back.
Okay.


MR. BISHOP: Hi.

Mr. Bishop,
how are you doing?

New mailman brought me
your bills.

I don't need them.
GARY: Well, thank you, sir.

Steve's sure been busy
around your place.

Weeding and planting, up
and down in your attic. Oh.

I got tired just
watching him. (BOTH LAUGH)

See you.
I'll see you.

STEVE: Gary, what do you
think of your pear tree?

What's it doing here?

Your housewarming present. I
did some weeding out back, too.

Thank you. Mr. Bishop said you've
been in and out of the attic.

Yeah, I noticed some wire
came loose from your pole,

so I disconnected it
in the attic.

You know, loose wires
can be dangerous.

Well, you really can just
let me know next time.

to taking care of the place.

It's like
second nature now.

Well, thanks.
I'll see you later.

Well, Susan asked me
for lunch.

Well, come on in.

GARY: Hi, sweetie.
Hi.

Where are you going?
I'm so sorry.

I just realized today
registration opens at state,

and I've got to be there
to get any music classes.

Music classes? How come?

Well, I wanna
improve on my piano.

How much better can you get?

Well, thank you for
the compliment, Steve,

but, a lot better, actually.

I'll see you later.
See you later.

You okay with her
running around like that?

It's more than okay
if it makes her happy.

Huh.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Nancy working full-time, that doesn't
seem to hurt your marriage, doesn't it?

No.

We couldn't be better.

You know, you got to
keep the ladies happy.

Amen.

Oh.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Why the royal treatment?

Do I have to have
an ulterior motive?

<i>SUSAN: (CHUCKLES)
 Well, I'm sure you do.</i>

plans for you.

You do?
Mmm-hmm.

Oh, that's so
interesting,

because I have plans
for you, too.

Isn't that interesting?
Do tell.


(GARY GRUNTS)


(METAL RATTLES)

Was that the kids?

No. No, they could sleep

through a hurricane.

Besides, it didn't come
from there.

No, where did it come from?

It's probably some cat

trying to get
into the garbage.

You want me to check,
don't you?


(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE)

MAN: So, you have
everything you need?

WOMAN: Okay, Bill,
thank you.

(BELL DINGS)

MAN: Dixie Hardware,
may I help you?

Hey, Susan,
what's the big project?

Hi, Steve.

I am going to wallpaper
my bathroom.

How about you?

Well, I was gonna pick up some
supplies and head for the farm, but...

Sure is looking
like rain.

Yeah, I guess so.

No matter now,
since I'm needed elsewhere.

You know, hanging wallpaper
is but one of my many talents.

Oh, that's okay.
I'd rather do it myself.

I don't want to take you
from your work.

You let me
worry about that.

(ENGINE STARTING)

Do you remember Brenda and
Jason from high school?

Not really. Be careful.
It's crooked.

Jason ran off with
their dental hygienist,

left Brenda to raise
four kids by herself.

She started drinking.

Oh, that's awful.

Listen, why don't you let me
get up there and do that?

Don't worry.
I got it under control.

Is there something bothering
you? You seem tense.

No.

Whatever it is, you know,
you can talk to me.

I'm just real picky
about my wallpaper.

(CLEARS THROAT)
(DOORBELL RINGS)

Oh, hello, Emily.
Hello, ma'am.

Is my husband here?
Uh, yes, ma'am.

May I speak with him?
Yes, ma'am.

He's hanging wallpaper
for my mom.

Steve, what are you doing?

I'm helping Susan with the
wallpaper. What's it look like?

Well, I need you
at home.

That is, if you can
spare him, Susan.

Yes.

Uh, he's done more
than enough here.

Thank you.
And thank you, Steve.

I appreciate it.

Well, at least
it's halfway done.

Bye.
STEVE: See you, Susan.

Okay. Bye-bye.

What?

He was hanging wallpaper
in my bathroom.

Now there's a man
that needs a hobby.

Sometimes I think I'm it.

Well, is he
bothering you?

No, not really.

It's just, um, he comes
around a lot to talk.

You know, I think he gets really
lonely when Nancy's at work.

Has he ever done
anything out of line?

Made a pass, you mean? No.

No, it's not like that.
It's just...

It's inconvenient.

You know, when I've got
to get things done...

Even though he's
just trying to help, but...

Why don't you just
tell him to get lost?

I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

Well, that's ridiculous!

It's not. What about you
with the guy...

who really wouldn't shut up?

You never said anything.
It's the exact same thing.

It is not. That is
completely different.

It's not.

There's nothing wrong
with trying to be nice.

Besides, it's how I was brought
up. It's a southern thing.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

Hey!

Good run?

Yes, it was, thank you.

My legs hurt a little bit,
but, you know.

Well, if you're tight, maybe
you should jump in the hot tub.

Oh, I can't.
Thank you, though.

But I promised Emily
I'd take her shopping.

Go shopping later. Bring Emily
along. It'll be more fun.

And a heck
of a lot cheaper.

Well, we'd be in your way.

No, no, no, no. I got to
go to the farm, anyway.

You all just make
yourselves at home.

You can change right there
in the laundry room.

Thank you.

All right.

EMILY: I don't want anyone
to see me in my swimsuit.

Why not, sweetheart?
You look great.

No, I don't.

What if he
comes back early?

Well, then, we'll go home.

Okay, then.

Okay?
Okay.

Get your towel.

So, are things better
at school? A little.

Having them at
our house helped.

Good.

Mom, can we get
our own hot tub?

Yes, sweetheart, right after
we finish the tennis court.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

SUSAN: I ran into Steve today
near the grocery store.

Anything new
and interesting?

No, not really. Just...

Sometimes I'd like to shop
in peace, you know?

Is he becoming a pain?

No.

He's just
trying to be nice.

But I have to keep
reminding myself

that if it weren't
for him,

we probably wouldn't
have this house.

Hmm.

Well, I've been thinking.

Hmm?

Why don't we take Orin
camping for his birthday?

What do you
say to that?

I think
he would love that.

Would you like it?
Yes, I would like it.


GARY: Thanks a lot, Steve.

SUSAN: So, Korey, feed
the fish once a day, okay?

STEVE: Don't worry about a
thing. I got it under control.

Thank you.

Have a great time.

SUSAN: Thanks.

GARY: Honey.

Now, this one would
make a good spatula.

Don't start.

You remember,
don't you?

It was my first
camping trip.

It's not my fault I forgot
the cooking utensils.

Bacon, eggs, and grits,
all cooked with a stick.

Now, the hardest part was
eating the grits with a stick.

But, once you got
past the splinters,

it was fine.

Well, a little roughage
did you good, didn't it?

Besides, you didn't seem
to mind the skinny-dipping.

Oh.

And you didn't
seem to mind

the snuggling in
the sleeping bag.

No, ma'am.
No.

And the stars.

It was so quiet.

Mom! Dad!
I found an arrowhead!

quiet. (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

It's probably a fake.

You don't know for sure.

Check it out?
Yes.

(SUSAN LAUGHS)

GARY: Help now.
Everybody grab a bag...

(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)

Did you guys leave
the stereo on?

That's Steve's music.

Disco reeks.


Nancy?

What are you
doing here?

Orin, you take
the winner.

(MUSIC STOPS) Orin, no
fighting in the house, please.

ORIN: But, Mom, it's not
fighting. It's wrestling.

And it's not happening in the
house. Take it outside, please.

They're not doing
any damage, Susan.

They're just
blowing off some steam.

Uh, what are you all
doing here, Steve?

STEVE: Oh, man, our furnace
went out last night.

They're working on it
right now and Steve said

that you wouldn't mind.

Well, I knew you wouldn't. What
kind of neighbors would we be

if we didn't take care
of each other?

Yeah, we do apologize. We left
everything exactly as we found it.

And Steve even
fed your fish.

(BOTH LAUGH)

Uh, the boys brought their sleeping
bags, slept in the living room.

Nancy and I slept
in Emily's.

We would have asked,

excepting we had no way
of reaching you. So...

STEVE: Look, uh,

I'm real sorry if we
caused any inconvenience.

I'll do my best
to make it up to you.

Come on, Nancy.
Yeah.

STEVE: Let's go, boys!

(DOOR CLOSES) Mom, why
didn't you say something?

They slept in my bed.

What could I say?

personal and private space,

and I did not
invite them in.

I'm going to
disinfect everything.

I can't believe
they'd just move in here.

Obviously, they didn't think
anything was wrong with it.

I asked Korey
to feed the fish,

and Steve managed
to screw even that up.

Any of them belly up?

Well, no, but the chemical
balance was all off,

and I just...

He thinks he's
doing us favors, but...

I know. We could use
a few less favors.

Yes. Are you leaving?

Mmm-hmm. What are
you up to today?

Um, I'm gonna
take a shower,

and then I'm gonna
work on my music.

Hmm.
Hmm.

Hurry home.

a bad hair day. Ugh.

(TELEPHONE RINGS)

Hello?

Uh, she's in the shower.

Yeah, I'll tell her
you called.

Bye.

Mr. Glover.

Mom!

Susan!

(PLAYING STOPS)


Susan.

Didn't Emily
say I called?

Yes, Steve,
what's on your mind?

I'm, uh... I'm sorry
about the fish.

I must have misunderstood
your instructions.

If there's any permanent damage,
other than the water being murky,

I wanna
make it up to you.

Forget it.

I don't think you're
having a bad hair day.

Hey.

Hey, let's go out
for lunch, okay?

We need to talk alone.

So how does Steve know
about the fish tank?

Or that I was having
a bad hair day?

It's like he's
eavesdropping on us, Gary.

But how?

I mean, why?
None of it makes any sense.

Well, it explains
how he always knows

where I'm going.

talk to him.

He'll only lie...

Unless we have proof.

It's gonna be fine.

GIRL: Car wash!

(HORN HONKS)

GIRL: In here!

STEVE: Whoa! Water fight!

Get him, Amber.


Okay. Smile, girl.

That's nice. Okay.

Rub-a-dub-dub, everybody.

Steve, I need you
to be cashier.

I'm making a video
for the retreat.

You've shot enough, Steve.
It doesn't have to be an epic.

Did somebody wake up on the wrong
side of the bed this morning?

No, I'm sorry. I don't
mean to snap at you,

it's just, well,
we're the only adults here,

and I need you to handle the
money while I take a break.

Why didn't you say so?

Where's my mom?

She'll be right back.

How have you managed
to stay so dry, huh?

I'm collecting money
like my mom said.

Oh, good.

Hey, Amber!

Come trade places
with Em.

Getting physical
will be good for you.

Work off some of that ice
cream we're gonna have later.

JUSTIN: Emily!

No, don't!

STEVE: (LAUGHING)
Get her, Justin!

She's scared you'll wash that
blond right out of her hair.

I don't dye my hair!

JUSTIN: Hey, what are you...
How do you like it?

Honey, are you
all right? No.

Emily?

Not now.

How did Emily
get soaked?

The same way
all the other kids did.

A little water
never killed anybody.

Look, I know you're just
trying to protect her,

but, maybe it's time
you eased off a little bit.

A kid's got to
grow up sometime.

You all right,
sweetheart?

He's such a creep.

I can't stand him.

He embarrassed me
in front of everybody.

I'm sorry.

Never mind.

TISHA: Okay, Susan,
what's going on?

You haven't said
more than two words.

You'll tell me
I'm being paranoid.

Oh, come on. Give us some
credit here. Maybe we can help.

(ALL PANTING)

Okay, but don't laugh.

We won't.

I think Steve Glover
is bugging our house.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! What?

Why?

There are just
too many coincidences.

Last week, Emily told me that
she wanted someone to run with.

Five minutes later Steve's
at our door in running shoes.

Do things like that
happen a lot?

I look in the mirror
and I say,

"Talk about
a bad hair day."

The next thing I know,

Steve's right there
in front of me,

telling me I'm not
having a bad hair day.

You know, I always thought
Steve obsessed on you.

Why do you and Gary
put up with it, huh?

Well, he was very helpful,
you know?

I mean, it was a great
friendship at first.

I just wanted to give him
the benefit of the doubt.


He's a deacon in our church.
Our kids play together.

So that makes it okay
for him

to sleep in your house
without asking?

I mean, never mind
bugging your house?

Well, we don't know
that for sure.

And until we find out,
I have to be civil

because we still co-sponsor
the teen group together.

Oh, Susan,
if I were you, I'd resign.

Well, I can't.

He flirts with
the other girls.

It's not just me,
and they're teenagers.

They don't know
how to handle that.

Well, you're an adult,
and you can't, either.

Besides, he's always takin'
pictures and videos.

I just want to make sure
there's nothing inappropriate

that's going on, you know?

There's somethin' wrong here.
That's for sure.

We need to find out what.

Let's go check out
his house.

Oh, come on. Are you
crazy? We can't do that.

Sure we can! Come on!

(ENGINE STARTS)

I don't think I can
go through with this.

Come on.
He gave you guys a key.

He's invited you over thousands
of times whether he's home or not.

You're merely accepting
a standing invitation.

Not an invitation
to search his house.

You have no choice.

It's the only way you'll find
out if he's hiding something.

(BABY CRYING) Okay, but if
everything's on the up and up,

we are out of there in a
heartbeat, right? Definitely.

Aw. There's a good girl.

Come on, now.
Mama's here.

You got any cereal?

Yeah, help yourself.

(BABY COOING)

(DOOR CLOSES)

Oh, my God.
They've been robbed.

Oh, no. You've obviously never
been here. It's always like this.

Let's start in his
office, okay? Wait.

Are these really
necessary? Absolutely.

Not only will we not leave
any fingerprints,

we won't pick up
any bacteria.

(BABY COOING)

Okay, honey.


You wait here
and be good for Mama.

See a key anywhere?
No.

You look in here.
I'll check around.

Okay.

Should I check out
the bedroom?

No!

Look. I found some photos.

Anything disgusting?

Just a picture of me
with my mouth full

at the picnic
a few months ago.

look at a few of these tapes

that aren't labeled.

(INDISTINCT TALKING
ON VIDEO)

Anything?

<i>NANCY:  Open it up.
 There you go. There you go.</i>

SUSAN: Just Mr. and Mrs.
Wholesome America

celebrating
with their children.

What about these?

I think we should go.

We ought to screen a few more
of them just to be thorough.

Okay, only a few,
and then let's go.

Okay?

(BABY COOING)

MARY: Mama will just be
a minute, honey.

<i> What we've got on the final
estimates in on the building fund,</i>

<i> on the extension
 to the hall.</i>

I'm feeling smaller
by the second.

SUSAN: Oh!

MARY: Oh, my God.

That's them having sex.

That's not their bed.

It's ours!


Oh.


MARY: Okay, we're almost
ready to record.

I still don't see why we
can't just keep this original.

'Cause that's stealing.

After what Steve's
been doin' to you?

SUSAN: I know, but it...

It's just so dirty
and humiliating.

I wish Gary would get home.
He'll know what to do.

I know what you have to do,
you call the cops.

Why?

I don't want anyone else
to know about this.

Gary and I can just
confront Steve...

No, that is not enough.

There has to be
some consequences.

I don't want my kids
to know about this.

And what about his kids?

What kind of father does
something like this?

All those things you do
when you think you're alone.

And he's been watching me.

MARY: There's no sound.

Oh, my God!
That's me on the toilet.

Why would anyone...
Because he's disgusting.

(HORN HONKS)

That's Gary and the kids.

Emily and Orin
cannot see this tape.

Can you stall them? We need
to copy as much as we can.

(GARY SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

Hi, guys.
It is so nice out.

Why don't you play outside
for a little bit, okay?

What's wrong? Hang on...

Mary and I just need
to talk to Daddy and Jack

for a little bit, okay?
Go on. Okay?

Susan, what's goin' on?

When you went to the game,

Mary and I went to the Glover
house to look around.


Alone? Are you crazy?

Just...

Would you mind waitin'
in the kitchen for a second?

Yeah, sure.
Okay. Thank you.

What is this?

Turn that tape off.

We can't.

We're making a copy of it.

Steve's got a camera
somewhere. He's been taping us.

That's not possible.
Nobody can sink that low.

MARY: This tape
proves he could.

We got to get the original
back before they get home.

That'll be any minute now.

Turn it off.

I'll take the tape
back to him,

and I'll shove it up...
Gary, no, okay?

His kids are gonna be
in the car with him.

We can't have
an ugly confrontation.

Is everything okay?

Uh, you can come in
now, honey.

I'm not gonna let that sick son
of a bitch get away with this.

Whoa. What's goin' on?

Steve's been making
home movies of us.

X-rated.

Well, how?

Where's the camera?

In the attic.

Let's go.

Want me to take
the tape back?

No, I'll do it.


You stay
with the kids, okay?

Okay.

EMILY: Where are you goin'?

I'll tell you later, okay?

Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

All right?
Don't worry.

(DOOR CLOSES)

Come here. Come here.

JACK: What do you got?

Hold this. Hold this.

(JACK GASPS)

JACK: Imagine that.

His own little
entertainment center.


I thought they were back.
What are you doing?

Not that they'd notice.

Go. Let's get out of here.

Okay,
it's time to record.

Let's see where
the cameras are.

It's right below us.

Where is it?

Oh.

Mary, look, right there.

Oh, my God.
I can barely even see that.

No wonder Steve
was so gung-ho

on helping me hang
the wallpaper.

Maybe you and Gary need
some time alone, huh?

Mom, can I go over
to Kris'?

No, honey.

Come on.
It's still early.

Not tonight, bud.

I just need to talk
to your mom right now.

(ORIN SIGHS)

What do we say?

Kris is Orin's best friend.

They didn't do
anything wrong.

Things can't be like the
way they were before.


I feel so bad
for Nancy and the boys.

Me, too, okay?

But Steve crossed the line.

Now, who knows
what he'll do next.

We have to
call the police.

No!

Everyone in Monroe
will find out about it.

Look, you have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

Steve's the one that did
something sleazy, all right?

But it's my naked body
on the video.

Stay over there. Over there.

Hey, Gary, how's Susan?
We missed her at the game.

She's feelin'
a bit nauseous.

You feelin' all right?

I've been better.

Well, I guess I better
get goin' then.

I wouldn't want to catch
what y'all got.

Say hi to Susan.

Yeah.

(SLAMS DOOR)

Now, where are
the holes?

All right, I'll show you.
Come here.

Right there.

Gary, he saw me naked.
No.

And he saw us making love.

No, no.

I'm sure the only thing
he saw was my big butt.

That's it. All right?

I'm sure
he didn't see anything.

He can be up there right now.
What if he sneaks back? He's not.

Susan, honey,
calm down.

Well, maybe you didn't
find all the cameras.

Jack and I covered
every inch of the attic.

There was no sound
on those videotapes,

but Steve knew what
we were talking about.

Maybe he was just lying up
there watching us having sex.

You're gettin'
all worked up, okay?

You got to stop this
right now.

You got to relax, and you
got to come back to bed.

He has seen me do things
you haven't seen me do.

I feel filthy,
I feel invaded, I...

Did you check
the kids' rooms?

The kids are fine, okay?

Now we can do this later.
This isn't the time.

What's that?
That's a hole, isn't it?

What is that?
I'm not sure.

Has he been videotaping
our children?

I'll tell you what, I'm gonna call
the police right now, all right?

Mommy...
Mmm-hmm.

Is everything all right?

Everything is fine,
sweetheart.

Go back to bed.

I heard you and Daddy
movin' around.

Who is he talkin' to?

It's just business.
Don't worry.

Okay.
Okay.

Good night.

Good night.

GARY: Yes, I'll hold.

(DOOR CLOSES)

The police are coming to take
a report first thing tomorrow.

All right?
Okay.

Come on. Come on.

You need to
get some rest.

(SUSAN SNIFFLES)

All right, lay down.

I want you to get
some sleep.

Now I'm right here...

And nothin' is gonna
happen to you.

Okay?

I'm right here.

I'm right here.

It's okay.

What? What is it?
What? What?

I can't stay here.

It's okay. We're alone.

No, I can
feel him watching.

I just...
I can't stay here.

It's just my work light.
I'll turn it off.

No, no.
Susan. Susan.

Gary, it's the only place
I feel safe.

Did you give Mr. Glover
a house key?

We knew he had one
from the time we moved in,

and he gave us
his house key,

you know, in case the
kids got locked out

or we wanted to use his
pool or his hot tub.

So, technically this is
not a break-and-enter.

Well, what is it then, some
kind of a peeping Tom thing?

Yes, but that only applies
to people outside.

He was inside your home.

But isn't that the exact
same thing, but worse?

Well, I'm not sure.

What do you mean?

He was in our attic,
wasn't he?

GARY: Listening to us.

Is the equipment
in the attic all his?

Yes, yes.

But I assume he ran it
off your electricity.


What does that have
to do with anything?

That lets us book him
for burglary.


For what,
stealing electricity?

Well, we'll fix that when
we find the right charge.

SUSAN: It's creepin' around
in our attic

and taking dirty movies.

I've never written
that up before.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING
ON RADIO)

I'll see you.

I can stay home
if you want me to.

No, the kids will think
it's strange.

I want to protect them
as long as I can.

Are you sure?
Mmm-hmm.

I can just take
the day off from work.

I'm fine, really.

All right.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Hey, Gary,
what's goin' on?

How come the cops
were at your place?

Is it somethin'
about the kids?

Actually, they're comin'
to get you.


What do you think
I should do?

Turn yourself in.

And you stay away
from my family.

Look, for what it's worth...

Get out of here, Steve.

Mr. Glover, you do understand
your constitutional rights?

Yes, I understand
my rights.

Did you videotape Susan Wilson
and her family at her residence?

Yes, I did.

What was your motivation
for making those tapes?

It's complicated.

I'm not sure why exactly.

I sure wish now
that I hadn't. (CHUCKLES)

Maybe that I...

Have a mental problem.

What sort of
mental problem?

Depression.

I'm depressed,
so I look at naked women?

did you make?

I'm not exactly sure. Um...

Only...
Four or five, I think.

Well, will you sign
a consent-to-search form

so we can search
your house?

Sure.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Mornin', ma'am.

This is a consent-to-search
form for some videotapes.

This is what
you're looking for.

This is all of 'em?

Yes, it is.

Thank you, ma'am.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING
ON POLICE RADIO)

So, my husband tells me

that there's a problem between
your family and the Glovers.

Bad news travels fast.

Oh, well, Steve called
the elders immediately,

seeking their
spiritual guidance.

He wants to do
the right thing.

He called after he knew
he was going to be arrested.

He's cooperated
with the police

and admitted
what he's done.

What more do you
expect him to do?

I don't know.


Do you understand
what he did

to me and my family?

Not exactly.

The charge was burglary,
but what did he take?

Videos.

He made videotapes of us
in our bedroom and bathroom

with a hidden camera
in the attic.

So he's crossed some very
inappropriate boundaries.

To put it mildly, yes.

Susan, I know you're hurt
and you're angry,

but think about
Nancy and the boys.

They don't deserve to
be dragged through the mud.

You know the other kids
will be merciless.

I know. I just don't think
that I can ignore this.

Could you, if someone
had done this to you?


I think I'd try
to rise above

my own
personal embarrassment

and think
of the greater good.

It's disturbing, I know,

but it's not like
you were raped or robbed.

Besides, there's always
two sides to every story.

Ask yourself why Steve was
so obsessed with you.

Maybe you were
leading him on.

I can't talk to you
about this, Joanne.

All I'm saying
is it's no big deal.

Worse things happen
to people every day.

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)



Any of your mom's
skin flicks back there?

What?

I hear they're pretty hot.


EMILY: Everybody else
obviously knows about it.

Do you mind tellin' me
what's goin' on?

We were just trying
to protect you.

Has this got something to do with
why I can't play with Kris anymore?

Yes.

I knew it.
What did we do?

Nothing, honey.
We love Kris.

Well, then why...
GARY: You didn't do anything.

Mr. Glover did
something very illegal,

and we reported him
to the police.

What did he do?

He hid cameras

in Mom and Dad's
bedroom and bathroom.

He was taping

what are supposed
to be private moments,

and that's a crime.

So we had to report him.

I knew he was a pervert.

I knew it.

Stop.

Did he do
anything to you?

No, just the way
he looked at me...

And everyone else,
you know.

So he was watching us
on the toilet and stuff?

Yeah.

Ew, that is so gross!

Does everybody know?

Are my friends
gonna see this?

Am I naked? Are these
on the Internet?

GARY: We don't know, Em.

We haven't seen
all the tapes yet.

How did the kids
at the store know?

They don't know anything.

What if I am on it?

Sweetheart,
just calm down, okay?

The police are gonna
take care of this.

No!

SUSAN: How many people
have seen these tapes?

Only myself,
Deputy Holt here,

and Lieutenant Hagen.

(SUSAN EXHALES)

Can we fast-forward
this, please?

Do you remember what day
this was shot on?

How could I possibly
know that?

How many of these tapes
do we have to watch?

Just these four and the one
that's playin' now.

But I saw stacks of tapes
at his house.

HOLT: Well, he said
this was all of it.

Maybe the others
were rentals.

GARY: Susan returned it
to their house,

so the original
should be here

along with the other tapes
that you took from him.

It must be one of these.

No.

No, these are
a different brand.

It's not here.

This is all we've got
in custody.

Well, there must be
some mistake.

GARY: Okay.

Hang on a second.
Where are you going?

We've seen enough for today.
We'll come back.

(DOOR CLOSES)


(WATER RUNNING)



Today Steve Glover
has asked to come forward.

Steve wishes to share
something from his heart,

and I would ask you to open
your hearts to him.

Thank you, Pastor.

Today, I ask forgiveness

from God
and my church family.

I've had a problem
most of my life.

Recently, because
of depression and stress,

that problem
got out of control,

and as a result, I've hurt
some people I hold dear.

My family.

Friends.

And this congregation.

I sincerely apologize to
anyone I may have hurt.

Because of
my irresponsible actions,

I'll no longer be able
to serve as deacon

here in the church

or work with
the youth prog.

I'm grateful to the elders,

close friends, and my family

for all their love,
concern, and help,

and with the grace of God,

I'm confident

that I will be able
to become

the person
that God wants me to be.

Everyone knew you spoke
from your heart.

You've done more good than
you could possibly imagine.

That means
a lot to me, Joanne.

(CHURCH BELL TOLLING)

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

I don't know how you
controlled yourself, Gary.

If something like that
ever happened to Tisha,

I'd... I'd go crazy.

I can't believe that weasel's actually
got people feeling sorry for him.

If people knew what
he really did...

Joanne says
it's no big deal,

meaning I'm no big deal.

But Steve is.

You know, I know
a reporter at the paper.

She'd be happy to do a piece.

No, no. I do not want
my name dragged into this.

Just...
I'll see you later.

Okay. Bye,
sweetie. Bye, Mary.

Bye, sweetheart.

(PIANO NOTE PLAYS)

(DISSONANT NOTE PLAYS)

Em, where you goin'?

To put this in Mr. Glover's
front yard where it belongs.

No, you're not.

If he was a child abuser,

he'd have to put a sign
in his yard, right?

It's the law.

It is in Louisiana,
yes, but... (SIGHS)

Sit down.

Someone's got to
tell the world

what a lying pervert
he really is.

Well, that someone
is not you.

Why not me?

I hate him just
as much as you do.

I know, honey,

but I can't let you fight
my battles for me.

But you're not
fightin' them.

Susan, are you
feeling better?

I've been praying for you.

I hope you've decided to drop
this thing with the Glovers.

They're actually talking
about moving out of state.

You have no idea
the heartache

this has caused them.

The heartache
it's caused them?

(PLAYS NOTE)

STEVE: (MUFFLED) You don't
want to play with me, huh?

Did you lock the front

You want to

Thank you.

(KEYS JANGLING)

Mom, do you want me to go
to the market for you?

Well, I went
to the market...

I don't mind goin'.

No, angel, I'll do it. You
need to do your homework.

I don't have any.

Did you read my essay
on Hawthorne?

No, sweetie, I didn't,
but I will tonight.

Your father said
it was really great.

But he didn't
read the book.

I want you to read it

so we can talk about it
like we used to.

Well, I will tonight.

Okay?

I promise.

Why don't you lie down
for a while?

I'll put it by your bed
if you feel like readin'.

Maybe I will.

Isn't the rule "No sugar
till after supper"?

Mom's rule.

Well... (CLEARS THROAT)
That's my rules, too,

and I have strict
instructions to enforce that.

For how long?

Until she's feelin' better.

Nobody's gonna feel better
till we plug up these holes.

We can't do that.

It might be evidence.

It freaks us all out!


Tomorrow, your mom
and I are gonna see

the rest of the tapes,

and then after that, we can
decide what comes next.

Won't the police
just arrest him?

Honestly, honey,
I'm not sure.

I miss you, honey.

I want my wife back.

And I want you
to let me hold you.

SUSAN: Gary, I can't.

Well, then I can
come to you.

There.

Nice and comfy.

Sort of like
one of our camping trips.

If I had been smarter...

If I had been
more suspicious,

maybe none of this
would've ever happened.

SUSAN: It's not your fault.

Well, I can't help it.

When I see you
in this much pain

and there's nothing
that I can do to fix it...

SUSAN: Nobody can fix it.

Baby...

We can't go on
like this.

Okay?

I need you to
come back to bed.

It's safe.

All the cameras are gone.

No, they're not for me.

It's all right. I understand.


It's all right.
It's all right.

It's all right.

Gary.

I'm sorry.


I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

No, I don't want to
postpone it again.

I'm fine, really.

Okay. Me, too. Bye.

Hello.

My husband is not going
to be able to make it today,

so I'm just gonna view the
rest of the tapes by myself.

(PHONE DIALING)
Mrs. Wilson's ready.

There's the performer.
Yeah.

Just ignore him.

I know how hard
this is for you.

You shouldn't feel ashamed,
Mrs. Wilson.

After all, you've got
a really good figure.

Stop.

That's the Glover
laundry room.

ISABELA: Are you sure?
Yes.

He's always inviting
people over for a swim

and telling them to change
in the laundry room.

You recognize
any of them?

(VOICE BREAKING) I'm pretty
sure that's Tisha from church.

And the other one,
I can't tell,

but her wedding ring
looks familiar.


Oh, my God!
That's my daughter, Emily!

Are you sure?
Is that her with you?

Yes! Yes!
That's my daughter, Emily!

She's just a child!


HOLT: I can see how a mother
might recognize her daughter,

but I don't think it would
hold up in court.

You can barely see her.

So Steve's off the hook
because she's naked behind me?

He didn't say that.

Well, what about
the other tapes?

Did you find those?

Mr. Glover swears
he burned them.

What do you mean,
he burned them?

Well, as part of
his so-called redemption...

We have no proof
that he didn't.

Are you gonna notify
the other people on this tape?

We'll, uh, discuss it
with the Captain.

No, they need to know now!

They need to know
as soon as possible.

They go over to
the Glovers' to swim,

and most of them
are teenagers and kids.

If you don't tell them,
I will.

Mrs. Wilson.

SUSAN: Uh...

I was viewing tapes
at the police station

when I saw some video
that had been secretly shot

in the Glover laundry room.

It was people, mostly women
from our church,

changing their clothes.

(PEOPLE MURMURING)

I'm not gonna list who's on it
out of respect for your privacy,

but I just thought that
you would like to know

that it exists, um, in case you
want to do something about it.

Do you know everyone
on the tapes?

Yes.

There is, however, uh,

one woman I couldn't
quite make out,

but I could recognize her
if I saw her wedding band.

So, uh, if you'd like to talk
to me in private later, um...

Thank you.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Well, I'd, uh, like to open
this up for discussion.

Um...

Mrs. Biggs.

Since Steve has
come forward

and asked for
our forgiveness,

shouldn't we practice what
we preach and forgive him?

As I see it, this falls under
the state's jurisdiction.

It is not
a church matter at all.

JAMES: I agree.

The quicker we're past this,
the better.

Better for who?

Please, Mr. Wilson, try not
to take this personally.

We understand
that you're upset.

"Upset" doesn't begin
to cover it.

All you people care
about is damage control.

It's so stupid to think
that they'd get involved

just because some of them
were on the tapes.

Susan, wait.

I have to know,
was I one of them?

Yes.

Nobody but my husband's
supposed to see me naked.

I know, sweetie.

I'm so sorry.


I left you a dozen messages.
Why won't you call back?

It's not you.

I just don't
feel like talkin'.

You know, no energy.

Well, the best way to
energize is exercise.

When are you
gonna run again?

Oh, I don't know.

I can't stand the thought of
people starin' at me.

It just...

Nobody is starin' at you.

Do you know what Steve's
been spreadin' around?

I don't care.

He is tellin' the world
how you hit on him,

callin' on his cellphone,

prancin' around
in your skimpy lingerie,

spaghetti straps with
Aztec print, no less.

I mean, what red-blooded man
could resist?


You know,
maybe in some demented way,

he honestly believes
you had an affair.

Do other people
believe him?

Some.

He is out there
selling his story

while you're
fallin' apart in here.

For all
you know right now,

he is videotapin' some other
unsuspecting family.

He wouldn't dare.

Sure, he would.

He's not sufferin' any,
you've cornered the market.

I just thought
when it happened

to other people that...

They'd be upset, too.

They'd be angry, too.

But they don't even
want to know about it.

What's wrong with me
that I can't get past this?


Even you think
I should be over it!

No!

I think you should
make him accountable!

And you are the only one
who can do that, Susan!

I've already
called the police.

Then you try
the district attorney,

and if that doesn't work,
you try somethin' else.

Okay.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY: If a peeping
Tom looked through your window,

I could prosecute,
no problem.

Isn't this
the same thing?

No, because he used
video equipment.

But aren't there laws
against recording people

without their knowledge?

That only applies
to recording with sound.

There's no sound
on the tapes in custody.

What difference
does sound make?

Well, there is a law in
the books against wiretapping.

There's no law
against videotaping.

The laws just haven't
kept up with technology.

But he taped us
without our permission.

He doesn't need it because
he didn't do anything illegal.

Videotaping people with
or without their knowledge

is not a crime
in the state of Louisiana,

or most of the U.S.,
for that matter.

So what he did is okay?

He destroys our lives,
and that's not a crime?

Not the videotaping.

I could charge him
with unauthorized entry

or destruction of property
for the holes he drilled.

The downside to that is,

he could play those
videotapes in open court,

and I'll guarantee you, the
defense is counting on that fact

to make you back off.

I know it's unfair.

Unfair?

It's insane!

If I was mugged, they
wouldn't mug me again in court

for the purpose
of demonstration.

If we pursue this
in criminal court,

what do you think
will happen to him?

Not much.

He won't do any time
if it's his first offense.

The best you should hope for
is probation and a stiff fine.

Would he have to admit
he did something wrong?

I don't see how
he could avoid it.

Well, that'll have
to be enough, then.

And what if they don't punish
him at all, even if you win?

It's not about
punishing him exactly.

It's about healing us.

How did Mrs. Wilson obtain
the tape she made a copy of?

She obtained
the original tape

from the residence
of Mr. Glover.

Was Mr. Glover there?

HOLT: I don't think so.

So, she entered the Glover
house without permission

exactly as she alleges
my client did.

Yes. But...

You mentioned that
a couple of tapes

were burned or destroyed,
when did that occur?

Sometime after June 29th.

Where did that occur?

Some property being
farmed by Mr. Glover.

Did y'all recover
any of those items?

We did not.

(DOOR OPENS)

Well, the good news is
Glover's coppin' a plea,

so that means no public
screening of your videotape.

The bad news is

no more discovery,
no sworn testimony,

no real record
of what he actually did.

What's he pleading to?

Unauthorized entry to
an inhabited dwelling,

three years'
supervised parole

and $2,000 restitution
to you folks

for the damage
to your home.

The punishment has absolutely
no relation to the crime.

Couldn't agree more,

but video voyeurism isn't
addressed by our legal system.

Look, I know
that you're tryin' to

protect your privacy
and your family.

But if you could tell
your story,

put a name and a face to
what happened in the media,

it might make a difference.

There's gonna be more and
more of these cases, you know,

I mean, anybody can buy
a video camera

the size of a pencil lead,

and the Internet
gives people ideas,

and it's got a great,
big appetite for your privacy.

Now you're only
one of the victims,

but I think that people
just may listen to you.

Do you really think a law
would be passed quicker

if I came forward and told
about what happened to us?

You mean go public?

Relive it over
and over again?

Maybe it could be
a good thing.

When he pleads
guilty tomorrow,

that'll be the end of it,

unless you do go public
and keep this thing alive.

At least you'll know that
the next time it happens,

it'll be a punishable crime.

I don't know. It...

GARY: Susan, up to now,

the press has respected
your wishes.

You go public,
you can't take it back.

So, if I do get involved
in getting a law passed,

that might mean
some more changes.

ORIN: Like what?

Well, it would take up
a lot more of my time,

and, um, we'd have to
deal with the press,

and I won't put us through
that if you don't want me to.

It would make me
really proud.

Good night, you.
Good night.

Mom...

Are you nervous
about tomorrow?

Not really.

I'm kind of looking forward
to hearing him plead guilty.

Even if it's in
the papers and on TV?

Would that be so bad?

Yes, I hate when people
gossip about me.

Yeah, I know exactly
how you feel.

But that may be the only way

to bring out the truth.

What about your reputation?

Well, a lot of times,

reputations don't have
anything to do with reality,

like with Mr. Glover,
he's a perfect example.

And if I had to do it
all over again,

I wouldn't care what people
thought of me,

and I wouldn't try to
get people to like me.

I'd just learn to
stand up for myself.

You're doin' a pretty
good job of that now.

Well, you are way ahead
of where I was at your age.

You're very, very special.

You don't have to say that.

Yes, I do, and I want you
to remember it.

Remember it and always
stand up for yourself.

Okay.

Okay.

I love you.
I love you, too, Mom.

We'll see you
in the morning.

Okay.


JUDGE: How do you plead?

Guilty, Your Honor,
under advice of counsel.

JUDGE: I take it that
you are prepared to admit

that you did commit
this offense.

Yes, sir.

(PEOPLE MURMURING)

My clients have no comment
at this time, please.

Thank you. Thank you.

(REPORTERS TALKING
INDISTINCTLY)

Please. Thank you.

MAN: Glover, over here!
Over here, Mr. Glover!

FEMALE REPORTER: Are you going
to pursue this in civil court?

How will you feel
if he doesn't go to jail?

When my family and I were
stalked by a video voyeur,

we thought the laws
would protect us,

but they don't.

The people need to know

there's a new,
invisible threat out there,

and it's almost
impossible to detect,

and then when you do,
there's no law to stop it.

And that has to change.

Excuse me.

MARY: Millions of people would
see you, it's Leeza Gibbons!

TISHA: You could defend
yourself if Steve mouths off.

Let him whine all
he wants to, you know?

He's just
behind me now.

Is this the same
Susan Wilson

who used to be too shy to
say no to anyone? (PANTING)

Well, some of my friends
challenged me

to stand up for myself.

So come with us!

You're the one
they really want.

I can't, y'all.

Thank you, but I've got
the speech of my life to make,

and I need to
take my time for it.

<i>LEEZA ON TV: Nancy, I'm
interested in your feelings.</i>

<i>ORIN: Hey, Mom,
 Leeza's back on.</i>

<i>LEEZA: If I found out my husband
had been engaged in this activity,</i>

<i> I would think, "Who is
this man I'm sleeping with?"</i>

<i> Aren't you a little
 freaked out by his behavior?</i>

<i>NANCY:  Well,
 I was a little hurt</i>

<i> and in shock
 when I found out,</i>

<i> but I know that
 my husband's a good person,</i>

<i> and what kind of person
 would I be</i>

<i> if I couldn't find it
 in my heart to forgive him?</i>

Nancy says
Steve's a good person,

people make mistakes.

It's her duty
to forgive him.

<i>NANCY:  ...but I know that
 my husband's a good person.</i>

<i>LEEZA:  Sounds like
 you're in denial.</i>

I wonder what
she really thinks.

<i>NANCY:  No, I'm not in denial.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)</i>

<i> Wait a minute,
 would you listen, please?</i>

<i> I admit what he did,
 but he wants to change,</i>

<i> so I don't see how that
 can mean I am in denial.</i>

<i>MAN:  It's a relative
 thing, Nancy.</i>

<i> You're plainly
 still in denial.</i>

<i> Steve has got
 a double life</i>

<i> that he has not
 worked through.</i>

<i>NANCY:  You don't know that.</i>

<i>MAN:  Steve,</i>

<i> let me give you a two-word
definition of voyeurism,</i>

<i> it's called "visual rape."</i>

<i>STEVE:  We're fine.
 Things are okay now.</i>

<i> We're doin' good.</i>

GARY: I didn't lose!

I had 293 points, and you
had six, and you had eight!

(DOORBELL RINGS)

GARY: You want me
to get it?

No, sweetheart,
I'm right here. I'll get it.

(DOOR OPENS)

SUSAN: Oh.
JOANNE: Hi!

SUSAN: Uh. Come on in.

I... I hope I'm not
interrupting your supper.

SUSAN: No, no.
I'm just getting started.

It smells delicious.

Well, I hope so.

It's, um, it's my own version
of jambalaya.

<i>I, uh, saw
the  Leeza show today.</i>

Really?

I feel like such a fool.

And I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

I remember
how cavalier I was

when you asked me
how I would handle it,

and when I saw
that show today,

I realized it would kill me.

Is this the ring
you saw on the tapes?

It wasn't you.

Oh, God.

Thank you!

Thank you.

I won't keep you.

I'd like to start jogging

with you and Tisha
and Mary again...

If that's all right
with you.

That'd be great.

God bless.
You too.

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

GARY: You told a fib.

Well, she couldn't
handle that.

Besides, I'm the only one
who knows it was her.

Some year, huh?


Our dream house turned
into a bit of a nightmare.

Yeah, but we are closer
and stronger than ever.

(INDISTINCT TALKING)

(CAMERA CLICKING)

MAN 1: Mrs. Wilson.
MAN 2: We're ready to go.

MAN 1: Mrs. Wilson, what do
you hope to accomplish today?

Hi. Thank you for coming.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

WOMAN: Good to go.
We're clear.

SUSAN: Can you hold this?
Yeah.


<i>SUSAN:  Good afternoon.
 Thank you for coming.</i>

<i> Um, I'd like to talk
 to you today</i>

<i> about a subject called
 video voyeurism.</i>

<i> Think back with me
 to what you did last night.</i>

<i> Now, imagine that everything
 you did was videotaped.</i>

<i> It's hard to imagine,
 isn't it?</i>

<i> You can go into your homes</i>

<i> and lock your doors
 and let your guard down.</i>

<i> But I can't.</i>

<i> You can go into your
bathrooms and close the door</i>

<i> and assume that
 no one is watching...</i>

<i> But I can't.</i>

<i> Although this looks like
 an isolated case,</i>

<i> it very well may be happening
 to one of you today.</i>

<i> It's a crime that is
virtually impossible to detect,</i>

<i> and it will become
 more and more common.</i>

<i> The Internet
 encourages voyeurs,</i>

<i> and the equipment for this
crime is readily available.</i>

<i> This crime takes money.</i>

<i> It takes time.
 It takes premeditation.</i>

<i> It takes knowledge
 of the victim.</i>

It takes knowledge
of the victim.

It is virtual stalking,

and it should be a felony,
not a slap on the wrist.

The very nature
of this crime

makes it especially
hard for the victim.

I feel as though
I were raped.

And my family has suffered.

In ways that
I can't describe.

However, even with rape,

the victim is not asked to be
raped again in the courtroom.

So, I ask you,

if there is any way for the viewing
of these tapes to be limited,

please consider the victims.

Each time another person
saw my tapes,

I felt violated.

Voyeur victims need the same
protection as rape victims,

<i> and I feel confident</i>

<i> that the representatives
 of the state of Louisiana</i>

<i> will make sure
 that video voyeurs</i>

<i> are adequately punished</i>

<i> and that their victims
 will not suffer needlessly.</i>

<i> Thank you.</i>
