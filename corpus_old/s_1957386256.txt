(singing in Swahili)

[Mr. Ross] Three
million years old.

[Diana] Give or take
a few hundred thousand.

[Mr. Ross] That makes it

the oldest human
fossil ever found.

[Diana] If you don't
count my ex-father-in-law.

We call him Adam.

Your father-in-law?

No, no, this guy.

Adam.

The first man?

Doctor Firestone.

This might be what you
say it is or it might not.

The fact of the matter is,
you only have part of it.

The jawbone is missing.

Yes, I know that, Mr. Ross.

That's why I've come to you.

With your help, I can
find the rest of it.

You're sure you haven't
told anybody else about this?

Cross my heart.

And I'm not going public
until I have it all.

That's why I came back
to New York to see you.

Well, we've gone this
far already, I guess.

All right.

Oh, Mr. Ross, thank you!

Thank you so much!

(singing in Swahili)

Welcome back to Africa, Diana.

Thanks for the
lift, Dr. Brinkman.

Wonderful news
about the grant.

I thought you agreed
there'd be no publicity.

Well, I couldn't let a moment

like this go unrecorded.

What did you tell
them it was, a summit?

[Male Reporter] Just a
few more, Dr. Brinkman.

Yes.

[Female Reporter]
Can we get one?

No, please, Dr. Firestone.

Here we are, Diana!

I've managed to get you
all the necessary permits.

Uh,

now, there we are.

This is, this is where
you'll be digging, isn't it?

You're close.

How close?

You've got the right country.

Now, now surely,
Diana, you can trust me.

Surely.

You're not still angry about
those photographers, are you?

What have you got against
a little publicity?

Nothing, when I've got
something to publicize.

Can't we just wait til I
find what I'm looking for?

All right, Diana.

From now on, we'll
do it your way.

Mums the word.

Dr. Brinkman, the
television people are here.

Oh (laughs).

Ta-ta, Dr. Brinkman.

Diana!

You can't leave me alone,

what do I tell the
television people?

That you're having
trouble with your reception.

(singing in Swahili)

(airplane engine droning)


Hey you!

Look at you!

Miriam!

Thanks, Barry!

[Calvin] Come here!


Oh, we're so glad you're here!

How on Earth did you
get the money this time?

Well, I did everything
but sell my body.

Oh, I might've done that
too, but it slipped my mind.

So how long will
the money last?

Well, that depends on you.

If you insist on
eating, six months,

but I have a feeling
we're gonna dig up Adam

long before that!

Listen, I got real good
news, I got the same crew!

Oh (mumbling)!

Diana.

What?

Diana, now listen,
before all this hugging,

I think you ought to give
them a little speech,

something inspirational.

Oh, inspirational?

Yeah.

Right, let's go!

All right, let's go!

How's New York?

Oh, I love New York,
where else can you see

all the best British plays?

[Miriam] And how's Nairobi?

Well, the traffic,
if possible, is worse.

So is Dr. Brinkman.

I think I prefer the traffic.

(engine roaring)

(singing in Swahili)

I can't believe I'm actually
back in this beautiful place!

It's great, isn't it?

Oh.

I can't believe it!

Who the Sam Hill is that?


Whoever it is, they're digging

smack in the middle of our site.

(jackhammer pounding)

(speaking in Swahili)

(speaking in Swahili)

(speaking in Swahili)

Well, well, well, hello!

Excuse my appearance,

we don't get a lot
of visitors up here.

Who the devil are you and
what are you doing here?

Being a keen
judge of character,

something tells me you're
not happy to see me,

whoever the devil I am.

And whoever the devil you are.

I am Dr. Diana Firestone

of the National Institute
of Natural History.

These are my colleagues,
Professor Sioki and Dr. Finch.

This is our site and
we have permission

from the government to dig here!

I'm Mr. Tobias
Williams and so have I.

[Diana] So have you what?

A permit, who gave you yours?

The Ministry of Culture.

Ah, there you are then,

mine's from the
Ministry of Interior,

and since this is the
interior, I think I win.

Oh really?

Well what are you digging
for, diamonds, gold?

Meerschaum.

What?

Meerschaum, you know, pipes,
Sherlock Holmes and all that.

I know what meerschaum
is, Mr. Williams!

Do you realize that
you are ruining

one of the most important
paleontological sites in Africa?

Paleontol...

Oh, bones, you mean?

Fossils!

Well, I can assure you,
there aren't any right here.

But there is quite
a lot of meerschaum.

Now, if I may suggest...

Mr. Williams, you
do not understand!

I understand very
well, Dr. Firestone.

You want to be here.

But I'm already here
and I'm staying here.

We'll see about that!

(speaking in Swahili)


(speaking in Swahili)


Oh, very good, Dr. Firestone!

I'm impressed with your Swahili.

And your telling them
that, after supper,

to send me their
old chicken bones

was childish and unamusing.

And your telling telling them

where they might stick
their old chicken bones

was inelegant,
but not unamusing.

I always knew we made a mistake

giving the Americans
their independence.

I wasn't under the
impression you gave it to us!

But he'll have destroyed
everything before then.

[Dr. Brinkman] It'll
take time, Diana.

Yes.

[Dr. Brinkman] Be patient.

Yes!

[Dr. Brinkman] There are
two ministries involved.

I am being patient,
Dr. Brinkman,

what you are hearing
now is patience.

You do not want to hear me when

I am impatient, Dr. Brinkman,

which will be in
exactly 24 hours

if you don't get that
pipe maker out of here!

[Dr. Brinkman] Much
tact is required.

All right!

[Dr. Brinkman] There are
two ministries involved.

All right!

[Dr. Brinkman] Be patient.

Look, I understand
Dr. Brinkman

and I'm not going anywhere,
I'll be right here.

KX21 over and out.

That's Brinkman, huh?

Oh, Calvin.

What'd he say?

You don't wanna know.

(sigh) Okay if I
take the Land Rover?

What for?

Well, a buddy of mine's
local area commissioner

over in Lamasa.

Maybe he can do
something for us.

What, like run what's-his-name
over with an elephant?

(chuckles) It's worth a try.

Maybe, maybe he
hates pipe smokers.

Maybe pipe smoking's an
instrument of evil to his tribe.

Yeah well, let's hope so.

Good luck.

Okay, I'll see you later.

Oh.

I know what you're thinking.

I could have handled it better.

Diana, you know
I love you, but...

Uh oh.

Sometimes it can't hurt
to let the other person

have the last word.

Because he's a man, right?

Nnn nnn, because
he's a person.

He's an annoying person.

Maybe you didn't give him
a chance to be anything else.

I suppose you found
him fascinating.

Especially from this angle.

Oh, I don't believe it.

Don't stare.

You'll just encourage him.

You want to trade places?

No.

What do you think?

I think he's
trying to make up.

Maybe we should too.

What do you want me to
do, go scrub his back?

Well, maybe you're right.

Maybe it's time for
a different approach.

(speaking in Swahili)

Look Enjoro, an emissary
from the enemy camp.

Hmm, something tells me she's
trying a different approach.

Hmm, invitation to dinner.

Shall I tell Dr.
Firestone anything?

You tell Dr. Fire-and-
brimstone I'd be delighted

to accept her
gracious invitation.

Mr. Williams, did Sherlock
Holmes really smoke pipes

that come from Africa?

Meerschaum, yes, absolutely.

Except there was
no Sherlock Holmes.

But, if he had
smoked Meerschaum,

it undoubtedly would have
come from East Africa.

The best Meerschaum
always comes from here.

Or Turkey.

How on Earth do you know that?

Crossword puzzles.

Well (chuckles).

Um, Meerschaum,
what is it really?

It's a form of clay so light
and porous that it floats.

The word's German.

It means foam of the sea.

How fascinating.

No, really it's
boring as hell.

Tell me, how long have the
two of you worked together?

Seven years now.

We started off by finding
a very ancient rat's tooth

together near Lake Pretoria

and knew we'd make
a good partnership.

Rat's tooth, huh?

Except we never found
the rest of the rat.

Yeah, until now (laughs).

Um, brandy or whiskey?

Brandy's dandy.

Candy is dandy.

Oh, I know the
verse, Dr. Firestone.

Ogden Nash is a
favorite of mine.

Oh.

Well, now you were
telling me about your work.

(light music)

Come with me, Mr. Williams.

(mysterious music)

"Alas, poor Yorick,
I knew him well."

"I knew him well, Horatio."

Everyone thinks it's
"I knew him well,"

but what Shakespeare
actually wrote...

Anyway, it's not Yorick.

We call him Adam.

Hello Adam.

You are looking at
what could be part of

the oldest hominid
skull ever found.

Where did you dig him up?

On the site you are
presently occupying.

Last February, but the rains
came and our money ran out.

Money has a way of doing that.

We're almost certain that
they travel in family groups,

so it's very likely
there are going to be

more significant finds.

At what depth
did you find this?

Three meters.

Well, I've reached
four meters now

and I haven't found anything.

Hmm, anything your chainsaws
haven't already destroyed.

I think I've been
fairly careful.

I always am.

Now, if you'd like to
know what I think...

Why would I wanna do that?

Why not?

I just wanted to say I
found a few bones myself

downstream a little way.

Now, if you try digging there...

Then, I wouldn't be
interfering with your work.

Nice try Mr. Williams,
but I know where to look

and it's where you are.

Don't you even
want to see my bones?

Well, I'm sure
they're very nice

but I doubt that they're
anything I'd be interested in.

Mr. Williams.

Thank you.

Why don't I stop
my work altogether?

Oh, Mr. Williams, would you?

We'd pay you for
your time, naturally.

Oh, that's very
generous of you.

Oh, just think, just think
how fulfilling it would be

to be part of the most important
archaeological discovery

of the century.

Yes, right.

May I make another suggestion?

Oh yes, please do.

Why don't you stop your work

and help me dig for Meerschaum?

Are you serious?

Why not?

You were.

Think how
fulfilling it would be

to make all the pipe
smokers in the world

happier and better people.

That's rude.

Really?

You know, there's a rather
arrogant presumption

on your part that what you
do is so much more important

than what anyone else does.

Have you noticed that?

Do I think that
finding a vital link

in the history of
man is more important

than digging up clay for pipes?

You bet I do.

Maybe I do too.

And maybe all those people
who like smoking pipes don't.

Knowledge has it's place,
Doctor, but then so does
pleasure.

Don't you talk philosophy
to me, Mr. Williams.

You don't give a damn
about knowledge, history,

ecology, or anything else.

You're just in
this for the money.

And what's in it for you?

Fame and glory.

That ought to be worth a
few dollars down the line.

I wouldn't be surprised if
you already have a last name

for this Adam of
yours, Firestone.

Firestone Man, right?

Damn right, Mr. Williams.

Well, now that we
understand each other better,

I shall say good night.

You must come over and
see my camp sometime.

Oh, we can see your camp
perfectly well from here,

Mr. Williams.

In fact, we can see
it all too well.

Good night.

Oh, uh, would it be
asking too much to suggest

that you cover yourself
the next time you bathe?

Dr. Firestone, don't
tell me I shocked you.

Not at all, Mr. Williams.

It's simply the sight of
a slightly overweight,

middle-aged Englishman
lathering his bum

when I'm trying to eat my supper

has a rather chilling
effect on the appetite.

Very well then, next
time, I shall, as you say,

cover myself.

From what I saw, it
wouldn't take much.

Diana.

Well, it wouldn't.

Good night, Mr. Williams.

Thanks for dinner, Doctor.

It was truly fulfilling.

Professor Sioki.

Can't you behave yourself?

Well, I tried.

Evening, Williams.

Matter of interpretation.

Hi.

[Miriam] Well, any luck with
the commissioner in Lamosa?

No, he turned us
down, but he did promise

to talk to the minister.

What's wrong with Williams?

He looked pretty ticked off.

How should I know?

Is this just sittin' here?

Mmm hmm.

Can I...

Sure, go ahead.

(light music)

(moving to mysterious music)

(speaking in Swahili)

(wind music)

This should do nicely.

(speaking in Swahili)

help you with that.

Right about here I think's good.

You're sure we're
not in your way?

Just ignore us, Mr. Williams.

I assure you we'll do the same.

You're about as easy to
ignore as a charging rhino.

Back off, Doctor.

There's plenty of
room for everyone.

If we can't dig where we want,

we'll get as close as possible.

If I find any Meerschaum,
I'll let you know.

(upbeat music)



(chainsaw revving)


Thanks (mumbles).

(motor revving)

(speaking in Swahili)

(speaking in Swahili)


Here, Enjoro, try this.

Better.

(chainsaw revving)

(speaking in Swahili)

I hate to interrupt this
drawing lesson, Enjoro,

but, if it's not
too much trouble,

I'd like you to fix my shower.

As bands go, is that a
good or a bad day's haul?

Best we could expect
after some maniac

with a chainsaw's been
hacking up the place.

Look, I know we've
got off to a bad start.

Neighbors should
try to get along,

so, since we're stuck
here together for awhile,

we might as well behave in
a semi-civilized manner.

Meaning what?

Meaning, I'm inviting the
three of you for a Happy Hour.

Yes?

When does Happy Hour begin?

As soon as you can get there.

Miriam, Calvin?

Would you care to join the
abominable Mr. Williams

for a drink?

Oh certainly.

Count me in.

I'll be expecting you then.


(light wind music)

You know there's
something I been meaning

to ask you, Williams.

That boy who works for
you, he's Maasai, isn't he?

Yes.

His name's Enjoro.

I call him my Man
Monday through Friday.

He's a damn fine cook, too.

You know, next time you
have a dinner party,

I should send him over.

If...

Well, well, that,
that's what's confusing.

I, I thought that all the
Maasai figured camp work

was beneath them.

Well, Enjoro's different.

He's got an odd history.

[Miriam] In what way?

Well, he's not held in very
high regard by his people.

When he was just eight, his
mother took him to the city.

And years later when he
returned, he had trouble

adjusting to the old ways.

For example, he wouldn't fight.

That meant he couldn't
become a Moran, a warrior.

So, you see, he's just an
outcast among his own people.

Yeah, the Maasai are very
strict in these things.

It's always been that way.

Doesn't have to be.

Here it does.

I think I need a walk.

Want someone to go with you?

No, thank you.

Like to see the lion
stupid enough to take her on.

Your friend, she likes
to take the world

on her shoulders, doesn't she?

Well, let's just say
that when she gets her mind

set on something, it's
hard to shake her loose.

Yes, but commitment
and stubbornness

aren't exactly the
same, are they?

(lighthearted music)

(speaking in Swahili)

Enjoro, these are for you.

Thank you.


We're getting similar
samples as the last time.

Yeah.

What do you think?

Well, I reckon we're
about in the same layer

as when we found that skull.

Well, let's concentrate
everybody on grid 16.

And clear some brush
from over there.

Maybe we'll start another grid.

Okay, you got it.

Ever heard of a
thing called a camera?

Yes, but doing it this
way allows me to concentrate

on the details.

And in this business,
it's the details

that tell you how to proceed.

Precise color of a chip of bone,
the shape of a small tooth,

they can be clues to the
difference of hundreds of
thousands

of years.

Shouldn't you be off laying
waste to the countryside.

(speaking in Swahili)

Come with me, there's
something I'd like you to see.

What?

Do you have to know
the answer to everything?

Can't you just accept
the possibility

of a pleasant surprise?

Sometimes I can.

Oh, don't be such a prune.

Well, I suppose a
minute or two of insults

could liven up the afternoon.

[Tobias] Watch
your step there.

[Diana] Hmm.

(light music)

Are we almost there?

Don't be so impatient.


Miriam, Miriam!

[Miriam] Yes?

(speaking in Swahili)

Get me a flashlight.

(cow bell clanging)

Are they all yours?

They're from Tarkanan.

That train's packed with
my Meerschaum for Nairobi.

These will be packed later.

You ever heard of a
thing called a truck?

(chuckling) Yes, but
camel doesn't need petrol,

doesn't rust, doesn't
get stuck in the mud,

and they're a damn sight
more interesting to look at.

Ever ridden on one?

Well, of course I have.

(speaking in Swahili)

But not for years.

I'd like you to meet Siamba.

Well, hello Siamba.

You have beautiful eyelashes.

Here.


You'll wanna make
sure to hold onto this...

Yes, I know, I know.


(speaking in Swahili)

(comical music)


(ominous music)

[Miriam] Strange.

It appears to be an
old volcanic vent.

Let's see how far this goes.

[Man] Go carefully.

[Miriam] I'll just
check if it's stable.

Solid magma in the soil.

It's definitely volcanic.

Wait here.


Is it Adam?

Not unless he died in
the last hundred years.

Get Dr. Firestone and Dr. Finch.

[Diana] I should be
getting back to the dig.

[Tobias] You're a real
obsessive, aren't you?

[Diana] People in my
profession usually are.

A lot of demented diggers.

[Tobia] (chuckling) Not
like the Meerschaum business.

We're a happy-go-lucky lot.

[Diana] Is that all you
do, dig for Meerschaum?

[Tobias] Day and night, no.

[Diana] I meant
professionally.

Well, that depends on
what one calls a profession.

How about alligator wrestling?

You did that?

Well, you're trying
to capture live ones,

wrestling is about the
only option one has.

Then what did you do?

Sell them to zoos?

Oh, I don't like zoos.

Animals go insane in captivity.

No, we were moving
them from an area

that was being developed
to a national park

where they'd be left alone.

Well, I'd call
that a profession.

What else?

What else?

Let's see started an air
taxi service in Ghana

that went bankrupt.

A trading post in Uganda
that was nationalized.

That's official-eeze
for confiscated.

Opened a Land Rover
agency in Mombasa.

My partner pushed me out though,

Sir Gary Amunde.

Oh, represented a
whisky company in Angola

until the communists convinced
the people to drink vodka.

Want to hear more
success stories?

[Diana] Is there
anything you haven't tried?

[Tobias] I'm sure there's
one or two golden opportunities

I haven't scrambled up yet.


I'll get around to them
eventually no doubt.

(cow bells clanging)

[Diana] What did you wanna
be when you were young?

[Tobias] Promise
you won't laugh?

[Diana] No.

[Tobias] No, you won't laugh?

[Diana] No, I won't promise.

A lifeguard.

Think of it, we're sitting
on a beach all day,

basking in the sun,
gazing out at the ocean,

watching the birds
in their bikinis.

Was there ever a better
job invented by man?

Not much future in it.

Well, I've never been
too crazy about that word.

Nothing makes the
time pass quicker

than thinking about the future.

Can't wait until tomorrow,
can't wait until I grow up,

can't wait until I retire.

You know what's happening
while you can't wait?

You're life's getting used up.

Next thing you know
you're through waiting

because it's all over.

No, I'll take the present
over the future any time.

There's something
missing from all that.

What?

A career, a plan, a goal.

Those things are important
to you, aren't they?

Very.

No, they're not to me.

Well, that's the difference
between us, Mr. Williams.

You only care about the present

while my life is dedicated to
a future built in the past.

Come quickly.

Miriam has found something.

(ominous music)




(dramatic music)

[Man] Dr. Firestone.

Miriam went inside
and it caved in.

[Man] Mr. Williams,
there's trouble in the camp.

(speaking in Swahili)

Miriam!

Miriam!

IF you can hear me, answer me.

Hey, what's happening?

Diana and Miriam are down
there and it's caved in.

[Calvin] A flashlight,
anybody got a flashlight?

Here.



Ow.


(speaking in Swahili)


You okay?

(coughing) Yeah.


[Calvin] Want
me to go with ya?

[Tobias] No, you stay here

and (mumbles).


(mysterious music)

Miriam, damn it, where are you?

Miriam?

Do you hear me?

Calvin!

Pull!

(dramatic drumming music)

[Tobias] Easy.

There she is.

Grab her, help him, help him.

Careful, watch her head.


Your job is to get
back on your feet

just as soon as possible.

Don't you worry about a thing.

Calvin's gonna go to
Nairbobi with you.

You try to stay out of the
discos for a few nights, huh?

I'll talk to
you in a few days.

All right, hold on.

(light flute music)

How about some barely
drinkable tea with brandy?

No thanks.

Go ahead.

It's a light shock.

You both could have been killed.

Takes a while for
that to sink in.

I wanna thank
you for your help

this afternoon, Mr. Williams.

We were all very lucky today.

Those tunes that Enjoro
plays on his flute,

they're lovely.

I've never heard them
anywhere in Africa before.

I asked him about them once.

He said they just
came into his head.

That's what Mozart said.

He's very talented.

Just think what he could
do with an education.

Isn't what he's doing enough?

Maybe it is.

You know, that's the
first time since we met

that you've even partially
conceded a point.

There may be hope for you yet.

(speaking in Swahili)

[Tobias] Nashar.

(speaking in Swahili)

Maasai friends have come to
warn us about a rogue lion

that's killing their cattle.

I'm packing my crew over there
to help them hunt it down.

Have you ever seen a lion hunt?

No.

I'm not sure I want to.

Well, why don't you come
along just for the ride?

You can see the village
and give your bones a rest

at the same time.

All right.

We leave in half an hour.

No need to dress.

(speaking in Swahili)


Dr. Firestone, this is Nashar.

(speaking in Swahili)

I promised Nashar
he can ride up front.

You won't mind, will you?

Oh, no, no.

(doors slamming)

(engine revving)

Friendly, isn't he?

No, he likes you.

I've never seen him
take to anyone so fast.

(chuckles) Really?

(speaking in Swahili)

(speaking in Swahili)

The lion do this?

Yes.

I'd say it's pretty
old by the look of it.

That's when they're
most dangerous.

They've been pushed out of
the pride by the young lions

and they have to survive
any way they can.

That's how we
treat our old people.

You gonna track him now?

The kill isn't that fresh.

He could be miles away by now.

Let's pay our respects
to their village first.

(speaking in Swahili)

(speaking in Swahili)



(speaking in Swahili)

(speaking in Swahili)

How long have you
been teaching here?

About three years now.

Three years?

Yeah.

How many children?

About seven.

Is that Tobias Williams, huh?

Yeah, he donated these to us.

(speaking in Swahili)

He got a number
of books in there.

Really?

A number of chalks.

Chalk and everything?

Yeah.

Oh, my goodness.

We're well-equipped.

(speaking in Swahili)




Amazing people, aren't they?

Yes, and very beautiful.


Not sorry you came?

No.




I saw those books.

Quite the philanthropist,
aren't you?

Ah, they help me, I help them.

Business is business.

The teacher was really
singing your praises.

Ah, he shouldn't
tarnish my image that way.

Oh no, of course not.


But it didn't
have to be books.

It could have been bubble
gum and blue jeans.

Good idea.

I'll try that next time.




(baby crying)

You have to drink
some, I'm afraid.

Would be rude not to.

It's made from...

I know what it's made from

and I'm trying not
to think about it.

(whispering in a
foreign language)

What's happening?

They've spotted the lion
again near the cattle.

Would you like to come?

If I don't, they may ask me

to drink some more
of this pombe.

You haven't had any yet.

(laughing) You mean,
you mean you don't like

fermented milk and cow's blood?

Enough, oh please.


Mmm.

(cow bell clanging)

(speaking in Swahili)


(light music)


(speaking in Swahili)

This fellow's
a smart old lion.

He's not going to let himself
get cornered this easily.

Lost him for today.

Well, if you wanna
know how I'd catch him...

Dr. Firestone, I wouldn't
presume to tell you

about old bones.

Leave the lion hunt to me.

All right, but I still think
my idea's worth listening to.

All right, let's hear it then.

I haven't had a good
laugh in an hour.

Why don't you just stake
out his earlier kill?

Bet ya anything he'll come
back to feed on it again.

That wouldn't work.

Why?

Because.

Why?

Because it wouldn't.

Hmm.

Nashar.

(speaking in Swahili)

(speaking in Swahili)

(goat bleating)

Where's Enjoro?

I'm leaving my crew to help
protect the cattle tonight.

Enjoro has to cook for them.

They don't like Maasai cuisine.

You can't just leave him here.

You know how difficult
it is for him.

He should be
used to it by now.

He'll be all right.

Used to it?

How insensitive can you be?

Now, look Doctor,
Enjoro works for me

and I need him here.

If you want to babysit,
that's your affair.

Otherwise, get in and
I'll drive you back.

If you really
wanna help the Maasai

why not start with Enjoro?

Make the others see
what harm they're doing

to an innocent boy.

I can't do that.

Why not?

Because their tribal customs
are none of my business.

I could do a certain
amount to help them survive

in a world they want no part of,

but I can't interfere
in their culture.

It's what makes
them what they are.

Now, either you respect that

or you're part of
the bleeding problem.

You really see yourself as
the great father protector,

don't you?

How pompous and arrogant.

How very British.

And you want to interfere

before you understand
the reality.

How very American.

Good bye, Mr. Williams.

Once again, your
company has proven to be

absolutely resistible.

Where the devil do
you think you're going?

Where I don't have to see
you, hear you, or smell you.

Smell me?

I happen to wash regularly.

Try washing your pipe.

Silly cow.


(marching music)

Get in.

It happens to be 10
miles back to your camp.

All right, if that's
how you want it.

By the way, good
luck with that lion.

He should be getting
hungry again by now.

No, you're right, you can
take care of him all right.

Just tell him he's
pompous and arrogant.

That should do the trick.

Killed my appetite.

Good luck.

Roar!

Meow.

Infantile.

(speaking in Swahili)

Dr. Firestone, Dr. Firestone.

Yeah?

Lydia says Miriam
will be all right

and Dr. Calvin
will be back soon.

Oh, that's great news.

Thanks.

(speaking in Swahili)

(speaking in Swahili)


(speaking in Swahili)

(romantic music)

Well, you look
somewhat presentable.

But I couldn't
find the trousers.

You also smell
somewhat presentable.

Well, thank you.

Coming from you, that's
high praise indeed.

Don't overdo it.

Would you care to see
our exclusive wine list?

There's only one wine on it.

I said it was
exclusive, didn't I?

We said some pretty
awful things today.

I think that's rather a
hopeful sign, don't you?

Cheers.

Cheers.

I fell in love with Africa
the first moment I saw it.

Historians have been
arguing for centuries

about where the Garden
of Eden was located.

There's no doubt in my
mind it was right here.

Did you ever fall in love

with anything less
than a continent?

Hmm, once or twice.

But, you never married.

How do you know that?

Well, you act like a man
who's used to being on his own.

No, I never found a woman

who could put up with
my brand of nonsense.

My habits, my gypsy life.

My pipe.

Oh, I can do that.

Something I can do.

This bloke you was married
to, what was his story?

He was a paleontologist too.

Trouble was, his
career had peaked

and mine was just
getting started.

Not very conducive
to conjugal bliss.

Then he started wanting things
he knew I couldn't give him.

A real home,
regular meals, kids.

A wife with clean fingernails.

Silly stuff like that.

He finally got what he wanted.

What?

Jennifer.

A big, broad-hipped,
blonde who got pregnant

when he looked at her,

and loads of inherited
money in the bargain.

And he gives boring lectures
at a boring girls' school

in New England (giggles).

Oh, dear Paul (laughing).

And you?

Me what?

What are you looking for?

A single man, one
that is silent, unique,

and elusive.

Ahh, Adam.

That's right.

I already have part of him.

Rest of him's buried
out there somewhere.

(light piano music)

Maybe he's closer
than you think.

If the Doctor would
care to follow me.

Well, these are
mostly small rodents.

This is a reptile.

Where'd you get them?

Um, I told you I was
careful when I dig.

Worth anything, are they?

No.

They're well-preserved
but fairly common.

This is worthless
too, I guess.

(ominous music)

Good Lord.

Where did you find this?

About two hundred
yards downstream.

Tried to tell you that at
that first night at dinner,

but you thought I was
trying to trick you.

Is it Adam?

Why, I can't say straight off.

I'll have to measure it and
match it against my skull.

Well, how about a
nightcap to celebrate,

possibilities?

You're welcome.


Must you do that?

This is maddening.

Why don't you just join them
together and see if they fit?

Mr. Williams, do I tell you

about Meerschaum...
Meerschaum, I know, I know.

Besides, doesn't match.

Doesn't, are you sure?

Mmm hmm.

It's very close in age, but
it's definitely not Adam.

Well, (mumbles) after
all, it is a jawbone.

Okay, how about
an explanation?

About what?

Not telling me
about this until now.

Allowing me to dig
on an inferior site,

when you knew all the time...

I've already told you,
every time I talk to you,

you always knew best.

Besides...

Besides what?

If I gave you that jawbone

and it had turned
out to be Adam,

we'd never have had a chance

to get to know
each other better.

Incredible.

You mean, you were
actually willing to hold up

an important advance
in human knowledge

so we could know
each other better?

Why not?

The world has waited millions
of years for this advance.

A couple of more days
couldn't have hurt.

So, now that you've
given it to me,

I suppose you do know me better.

A little.

Just what is it
you think you know?

I know that everything
you do that I disapprove of,

your compulsiveness,
your combativeness,

your stubbornness are things
that I've come to admire.

If you're trying to
convince me that you are not

a totally insensitive ass,
you're wasting your time.

I'm not trying to
convince you of anything.

I just want to help you
with your old bones.

Just whose old bones
are we talking about?

Do you think you could
keep your mouth shut

long enough for me to kiss it?


I don't want to
hold up your work.

Now that you know where to dig,

I'm sure you'll want to
get on with it right away.

I guess the world
could wait another day.

(romantic piano music)

(romantic piano music)


(speaking in Swahili)

Good morning.

Morning.

Have a good night?

Not too bad.

If you've nothing
better to do,

how about breakfast?

Don't mind if I do.

Your place or mine?

Mine.

20 minutes.

I'll be there.


I don't know about all of this.

Next thing you know,
I'll be reading the Times

and asking you to
pass the marmalade.

Uh, would you rather we
didn't talk at breakfast?

I don't know.

I haven't had breakfast with
a human female for years.

It seems all right.

So far.

Well, it's okay with me.

I'm not sure I could keep
it up three meals a day.

Oh, well, well, you have
nothing to worry about.

I never eat lunch.


Come on, I'll show you
where I found that jawbone.

(light flute music)

I was running test
bores right along here

as indicated by these markers.

And I found the jaw right
off this last marker here.

It was exposed, right
there in the sand.

There?

Here.

Well, I guess maybe it
could have washed down river.

You're the expert.

(singing in Swahili)

Come reinforcements,
Dr. Firestone.


Mmm hmm (chuckling).

Hey.

Nothing so far, eh?

We're not through yet.

Well, if it were
easy, it wouldn't be

so much bloody fun, right?

Now you're
getting the picture.

What's wrong?

My socks match.

Just stay where you are.

And don't move.

(ominous music)

(moving to dramatic music)


Look at that.

Look at that.

What's the verdict?

It's a perfect match,
no doubt about it.

Adam you mean?

No, no your person.

The jaw fits perfectly.

What do we call him then?

Adam's best friend?

Oh, I can't be
absolutely sure.

I've ordered some
radiocarbon testing

to determine the age.

I sent some scrapings
back to the States.

All right, but
what do you think?

I've got a good feeling.

At last.

Firestone Man, huh?

No, no, no, no, no.

You found the jaw, so it's
really the Williams Man.

No, I don't need that.

You're the one in
the bone business.

It's my gift to you.

(ominous music)

Oh.

I don't understand who
would do a thing like this

to you, Enjoro.

Please tell me who it is.

I cannot.

Please.

I only wanna help.

He's not about to tell you.

Leave him alone.

I think he's been left
alone too damn much already.

All of this is because you
insisted on leaving him there.

Now, don't make more
of this than it is.

He's all right.

He is not all right!

And you won't do
anything for him

because of some
ancient tribal custom.

I took him in, didn't I?

Yeah, right, and
then you sent him back.

For only one night.

Rome was burnt in a night.

This isn't Rome
and you don't know

what the hell you're
talking about.

Now, listen to me.

He's one of those
unfortunate people

who's fallen between the cracks.

He doesn't fit in with
his own people anymore

and he doesn't
belong here either.

There are people like
that in the world

and you can make yourself very
unhappy trying to change it.

You can't change it, Diana.

This isn't your country and
these aren't your people.

People are people, damn it.

Now what the hell
does that mean?

That Hottentots and Eskimos feed

and bleed and love their kids.

That's just another one of
your glib generalizations.

You have grand theories
about the world,

but you fail to take
into consideration

the problems of individuals.

Enjoro is the victim of
two imperfect societies,

his and ours.

Leave it alone.

I can't do that.

Now, I don't give a damn if
he can be a Maasai warrior.

He's bright and he's talented
and I wanna help him.

No you don't.

You want to mother him.

And just because you had
no children of your own...


Come with me.

Diana, where do you
think you're going?

Don't take him to
the village, Diana.

Diana, will you listen to me?

If you take him to the village,

you're going to
stir up more trouble

than you or he can ever handle.

(engine revving)

Diana.

Diana!

Get out of my way.

Not until you
listen to reason.

You can't go there
and start trouble

about things you
know nothing of.

(engines revving)

We can play this
bloody game all day,

but you're not going there.

(engines revving)

Damn.

All right then,
let's have a look.

(engine revving)

Now then,

you go back to your camp.

I'll go up to the village
to pick up my men.

Of course, just try
to be reasonable,

that's all I ask.

(engine revving)

(gun firing)


You're a lunatic!

You're a certifiably
crazy person.

You have to tell me Enjoro.

You must trust me.

I can help you.

It was Nashar, wasn't it?


(door slamming)


(speaking in Swahili)



Enjoro, wait.

(speaking in Swahili)


Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.


(speaking in Swahili)


Ho, ho, ho, ho
(speaking in Swahili).



(gentle flute music)

(speaking in Swahili)




(speaking in Swahili)


(shouting in Swahili)

(dramatic music)


(speaking in Swahili)

(drumming and clanging music)

(dog barking)

(speaking in Swahili)

(goat bleating)

Hear you were nearly
killed by that lion.

Serves you bloody right.

I was nowhere near the lion.

It was Enjoro who
saved Nashar's life

and he still won't talk to him.

What's the matter
with these people?

Where is he?

I don't know.

How's Nashar?

He's over there.

I tried to help but
they wouldn't let me.

Women don't count
for much around here.

It isn't women, it's
insensitive interfering women.

You really feel
that way, don't you?

No, I'm enlightened.

I get just as steamed off at
insensitive interfering men.

(speaking in Swahili)

He'll be all right.

What about Enjoro?

Obwa tells me Enjoro has
brought disgrace on his family.

His family?

How?

Nashar's his half brother.

Obwa's their father.

I had no idea.

Now, don't tell me there's
something you didn't know.

Never mind.

How disgraced?

He acted as a true warrior.

Isn't that what
all this is about?

What it's all about is cattle.

With the Maasai, their
cattle come first.

It's a sign of every man's
wealth, his influence,

his honor.

And Enjoro, in saving Nashar,
allowed a cattle to be killed.

Allowed?

He risked his life
to save Nashar.

Diana, the Maasai
don't think that way.

Cattle are their first priority.

That's ludicrous.

Is it?

What about those little
scraps of paper called cash,

that our countrymen,
yours and mine,

cheat and kill for,
risk their lives

running into burning
buildings for.

Is that any more
absurd than cattle?

Look.

(goat bleating)


Are you all right, Enjoro?

(speaking in Swahili)

They've trapped the lion.

(dramatic music)

(engine revving)


(ominous music)

(speaking in Swahili)

They've trapped the
old boy down in there.

Rather take him out in the open.

(dramatic music)

Enjoro!

We can spot him better
from the edge of the gorge.


(ominous drumming music)




(dramatic music)



This is his last chance.

He knows it.

We can't take that
away from him.





(chanting in Swahili)


(chanting in Swahili)


Well, he seems to
have solved his problem

by himself thanks to you.

Let's hope he's really
where he belongs.

Yeah, I'm gonna
miss him, though.

So will I.

What happens now?

With what?

With us.

Oh, I don't know.

Every time we agree
something else comes along.

(chuckles) Some
people might call that

a relationship.

(chuckles) Yeah.

Some people might
call it World War III.

I, I have another problem.

What's that?

I can't call you Tobias.

That's a silly name.

Call me anything you like.

How about Toby?

Except Toby, please.

Oh, well, there, you see.

We can't even agree on that.

What are we gonna do?

Well, for a start, why
don't we save time and expense

and combine our two camps.

Oh sure, now
that Enjoro's gone,

you're looking for a new cook.

(chuckles) Not
yours, heaven forbid.

Maybe we should just let
things stay the way they are

for the time being.

Why?

Because you're changing
me and I don't like it.

Why?

Because I know who I am

and what's important in my life.

Everything you say,
everything you do

is just totally opposite
from what I want.

What do you want?

To accomplish something.

To make a difference.

You're happy just letting
things go on around you.

And you won't be satisfied

until you've got me
doing the same thing.

Well, I can't do that.

It's against everything
I believe in.

All right.

And if those carbon
tests are positive,

if you really have
found the earliest man,

you'll probably go
back to the States,

to fame and fortune,

book, lecture tour,

TV talk shows,

cover of Time Magazine.

Would that be so bad?

That depends.

If you don't care
that your earliest man

may cost you your latest man.

You could come with me.

And do what?

I belong in Africa.

I'd be useless anywhere else
and I can't change that.

Another stalemate.

(sad music)

I'm sorry I slapped you.

No, I shouldn't
have said what I did.

I guess it's catching.

From me you mean?

I don't think you've
ever stopped yourself

from saying anything
in your entire life.

You're wrong.

(door slamming)

I'm doing it right now.

(engine revving)

(speaking in Swahili)


(light flute music)



(light flute music)

(speaking in Swahili)

Something to show you.

Enjoro delivered it
then he disappeared.

It's quite good.

He was dressed as a warrior.

He's all right then?

Mmm hmm.

What's all this?

Just packing up.

We've just about exhausted
the Meerschaum in this area.

You're leaving?

Don't seem to have
a reason to stay.

You're gonna go look
for some more Meerschaum?

No, I've had enough of that.

I've got a chance to
do some construction.

A bridge near Mombasa.

Oh.

(airplane engine roaring)

You expecting anyone?

Hmm unn, you?

Well, let's go see who it is.

You go on.

It'll be for you.

I've got a lot to do here.

(speaking in Swahili)

(plane engine sputtering)

Calvin!

Ha, hey.

Miriam!

It's so great to see you both.

What are you doing here?

Why didn't you tell me?

Well, it's a surprise.

What, what, what?

We brought a visitor.

Yeah?

Well, he didn't exactly,

he brought himself.

Diana!

Oh, oh dear.

Oh, Calvin.

This is Anna Latu,
the museum photographer.

How do you do?

I had to come and
tell you personally.

The carbon test of those
scrapings you sent,

are over three
million years old.

Ohhh!
Ah, you did it.

The young man who
brought them tells me

you've assembled a whole skull.

Then, you've found the oldest,

the oldest recorded human head.

Phenomenal.

Well, (mumbling) training for.

[Miriam] This
is just wonderful.

Diana, come here, will you?

I just want a picture of you
actually holding the skull.

A record for posterity.

(light piano music)

[Miriam] When did you find it?

Well, it's a long story but
if it hadn't been for Tobias...

Tobias?

Uh huh, it's a
silly name, isn't it?

Mr. Williams.

Don't tell me it
was cooperative.

Very.

I'm sure he'd love
to see both of you.

Excuse me, Dr. Brinkman.

We'd like to photograph
you at the dig.

Oh, you can photograph
anything you like.

We have to go see a neighbor.

Excuse me, Dr. Brinkman.

Certainly.

I'm just happy to gaze at him.

Asked Brinkman
to get in the act.

In on it?

He wants to be it.

I couldn't shake him
loose with a stick.

He may deposit one before
we get back to Nairobi.

I'm afraid he'd explode.

Calvin.

Tobias?

Tobias?

Hmm.

(speaking in Swahili)

(audience shouting)

(speaking in German)

Dr. Firestone, could
you tell us please,

how long the search
has taken you.

Well, about three years.

And there were a few
problems en route,

but I always, I always
thought he was out there

waiting for me.

What problems in
particular did you encounter?

(chuckles) Well, bad
weather, ran out of money,

not getting the proper permits.

And, another question?


Dr. Firestone, Toby
Williams, London Times.

You're not the London Times.

I'm from the London Times.

Shut it and sit down.

Excuse me, Mr. Williams.

What was that first name again?

Toby.

I see.

Doctor, having found a
three million-year-old man,

have you considered
that there might be

another man out there?

Oh yes.

But the question is where?

There are encouraging
reports about some old bones

in Mombasa just waiting
for you to dig them up.

I've heard about
those old bones.

But how can I be sure
they're the same ones?

Bones don't change, Doctor.

People do.

Do they?

Do they really?

Why don't you come to
Mombasa and find out?

(crowd shouting)

You at the back,
in the turban.

Jaga Sim, Punjab Times.

Dr. Firestone, what, in your
opinion, is still to be found

in your field of expertise?

Hmm.

Diana?

The answer is yes.

[Man In Audience] That's
a very strange answer.

Yes?

I don't understand.

(audience talking)

Yes.

Yes, yes, yes.

Yes, yes, yes, what?

(chuckling) Mombasa Man,

definitely going to
be my next project.



(dramatic music)

(singing in Swahili)

The limo will take you
straight to the airport.

Oh, it's wonderful,
Dr. Brinkman.

Bye bye.

Bye.

Bye bye.

Bye.
