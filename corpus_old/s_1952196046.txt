[ laughs ]

[ screaming ]

Daddy, are you  okay?

Daddy? Daddy?

Daddy, I-I--
Everything's fine, my sweetness.

[ laughs ]
Now let's get to work.

Great idea, Boss.
I am dying for some action.

Look, I want to catch
Ransik as badly as you,

but we're going to need help.

Hey, over here!

This is Captain Logan.
Do you read me?

We read you, Captain.
Where have you landed?

We followed Ransik
to the year 2001.

Sir, he's got a whole
prison full of monsters.

We need backup.
That's impossible.

With the Time Ship destroyed,
we can't send any human help.

Our weapons are at your disposal,
but the rest is up to you.

You're our only hope.

Yes, sir. We won't let you down.

Philips, I hate these things.
You can't attend

an executive meeting
without a necktie.

Yeah, well, maybe I shouldn't even...

Philips, stop. Stop, stop!

I got to go. Sorry, Philips.

Tell them something came up.
But, sir, I-I--

Come back here, sir. Come back.

All right, you bolt brains.
Let's blow this joint.

You're going to make me kick
your butt again, aren't you?

You kicked my butt?

Let me jog your memory.
Let's rock.

All right. The more, the merrier.

I'm glad you feel that way.

Well, looky who decided
to crash our party.

Destroy him!

Okay, no more.

Get him!

Game over.

Oh, my nail!
Come on, let's go!

I just painted it, too.
Move it!

They're going to pay for this.

Come on, Nadira.
I broke my nail.

It's no big deal.

Hey, you've got nine more, right?
Oh!

Don't talk to me in
that tone of voice.

But, Na-- ooh.

Hey, ease up. What did
you do that for, anyway?

I had Nadira right
where I wanted her.

I told you to stay out of our way.
But you need my help.

I told you this is none
of your business.

What's your problem?
I'm fighting on your side.

You're not fighting at all.
You're playing.

This isn't a game for us.

You've never had to fight
for anything in your life.

Of course I have.

What? Name one thing you've
sacrificed everything for,

something that helped
everyone but you,

something you couldn't buy.

That's what I thought. Let's go.

Trip, come on.

Aah!

Those Rangers are going to
spoil our whole plan, Daddy.

Ohh.

Ah, don't fret, my dear.
[ laughs ]

We're going to destroy
the Rangers

without even getting
our hands dirty.

Ah, the mutant criminals. Perfect.

[ laughs ]

Gentlemen, this is the
young man who's going to be

taking my place at bio
synth someday--

my son Wesley Collins.
Pleasure.

It's nice to meet you.
Why don't we just go inside

and hammer out the
rest of the details?

Please, go ahead.
Oh, Dad.

Yeah?
I'll be right in, okay?

Don't be long.
This is important.

Name one thing you've
sacrificed everything for,

something that's helped
everybody but you,

something you couldn't buy.

Psst. Wes.

Come on.

What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you, to explain.

No, no. Jen made it pretty clear.

She thinks I'm nothing
but a spoiled brat.

I don't know. Maybe she's right.

She isn't right.

I have ways of knowing.
I'm from the Planet Xybria.

Our gems give us special visions.

Here, I want you to see something.

Hey, that's me.
No, that's-- that's Alex.

He and Jen, they were
going to get married.

Will you marry me?

That was before Alex
tried to stop Ransik

from escaping to the past.

Ransik struck him down
without mercy.

And Alex was gone.

So that's why Jen...

It's all beginning to make sense.
Wesley!

Wesley!

Jen.

What do you want?
You were right.

I've never had to fight
for anything in my life,

But now I have
something to fight for.

I know about Alex.

Unless we stop Ransik
neither of us will have a future.

Please, let me help you.

Time to reverse
the chrono freeze.

The Jatara is ready
for re-animation.

Begin.

The re-animator works perfectly!

Now, go! Go and destroy!

Now let's just see how
tough the cops are in 2001.

Rangers, we got trouble.
Circuit's picking up

signs of mutant DNA at the harbor.

One more chance.

Ready?
ALL: Time for Time Force!

Hyah! Ready.
Let's do it!

Yeah. Wait.

Time to use the time jet.

Let's hope this works.

Its supersonic speed will
get you anywhere fast.

Come on, let me help you, Rookie.

Whoa!

He wasn't kidding about
the supersonic part.

This is intense.

So, Wes, do you think
you can handle it?

Piece of cake. Whoo!

Let's go!

Time Force. You're under arrest.

Your days of destruction
are over, Jatara.

We're bringing you back to prison.
Not without a fight, Rangers.

Suit yourself.

Chrono-Saber!

Time strike!

Circuit, what's happening?
His mutant has been exposed.

This causes him to grow
to a tremendous size

with more strength than ever.
Oh, great, now you tell us.

So what do we do now?

That's easy.

Just sit back and prepare
to be destroyed.

[ screaming ]

It looks like he's
attacking the city.

That does it. We need help.
Captain Logan, can you hear me?

We're sending the
Time Force Megazord.

Time Fliers online.

Wow! They're incredible!

You use your chrono morpher
to dispatch the Time Jet.

Right. Time Jet online.

Let's go.

Time Force Megazord mode blue.

Whoa. What do we do now?

I'm downloadng the data. Got it.

Guys, we have to all
control it together.

Gotcha.

I don't believe it.
It's not possible.

You got nothing on us, Jatara.

Aah!

Concentrate.

Aah!

Rangers, go to red mode.
You got it, Circuit.

All right, guys,
let's break it down.

Time Force Megazord mode red.

Delpoy Saber!

Shields up!

Yeah!
Wes, try using the saber.

I'm on it.
Time Force Megazord Saber.

Engage.

Aah!

Yeah, we did it!

Back where you belong.

Power down.

ALL: Power down.
There's one down.

Glad you captured this guy.
You mean we captured him.

We couldn't have done
it without you.

No. Keep it.

Really?
Yeah. You earned it.

Besides...

we need you.

Looks like we've got a Red Ranger.

Oh! Katie, Kaite, Kaite, Kaite!

Maybe we have a chance after all.
