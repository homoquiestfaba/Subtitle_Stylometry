<i>(Roger)
And so it began</i>

<i>thirty-thousand years ago</i>

<i>a man discovered</i>

<i>his best friend.</i>

Oh!

<i>(Roger)
Dogs were man's best friend</i>

<i>and only animal companion</i>

<i>for the next 15,000 years.</i>

<i>And then..</i>

<i>(Gwen)
Cats are in the house, y'all!</i>

<i>Whoo! Whoo!</i>


<i>(Roger)
For the next 15,000 years</i>

<i>cats and dogs
fought each other.</i>

<i>Hissing and barking
and breaking things</i>

<i>along the way.</i>

<i>With the emergence
of technology</i>

<i>harmless skirmishes
grew into diabolical plots</i>

<i>as cats and dogs tried
to eliminate each other</i>

<i>as human companions.</i>

<i>Eventually, humans grew tired.</i>

<i>So, dogs and cats
had to do something</i>

<i>if they wanted
to stay the number one</i>

<i>and number two animals
in the human household.</i>

<i>(Gwen)
Actually, fish are number one.</i>

<i>(Roger)
Fish don't count.</i>

<i>Anyway, cat and dog leaders</i>

<i>worked together
to stop these plots</i>

<i>and formed
an organization called</i>

<i>The Furry Animals
Rivalry Termination.</i>

<i>(Gwen)
Or FART!</i>

<i>(Roger)
Nah, that's not really a thing.</i>

<i>(Gwen)
It's totally a thing!</i>

<i>(Roger) The purpose of
the Furry Animals Riv...</i>

<i>[Gwen clears throat]
FART!</i>

<i>[Roger grunts]
...was to monitor</i>

<i>potential plots,
feline or canine</i>

<i>and stop them
before they interfered</i>

<i>with the human world.</i>

<i>(Gwen)
The good news is..</i>

<i>...we opened up wide</i>

<i>and let loose FART,
the most silent</i>

<i>and deadly organization
of all time.</i>

<i>We were able to stop those
plots and many others.</i>

<i>(Roger) The last decade has
been the most peaceful one</i>

<i>between the two species
in centuries.</i>

<i>(Gwen)
Huh! I wouldn't say centuries!</i>

<i>(Roger)
Well, you would be wrong.</i>

[instrumental music]

<i>(Roger and Gwen)
Ah! Home sweet home.</i>

[instrumental music]

[Max grunts]

<i>(Roger)
That's me, Roger!</i>

<i>As in Roger Federer.</i>

<i>The best tennis player
of all time.</i>

<i>That's Max, my human.</i>

<i>He used to practice outdoors
on court.</i>

<i>I would fetch tennis balls
for him</i>

<i>but now, well..</i>

<i>...he does... that!</i>

[cat meowing]

<i>(Gwen)
Hey, that's me, Gwen.</i>

<i>You know, as in Stefani.</i>

<i>And let me introduce you
to my fabulous person</i>

<i>the one, the onlyZoey!</i>


<i>[thinking] Mm,
she's under there somewhere.</i>

Argh! Driving me..

..crazy!




<i>(Gwen) Yeah,
she's not really a morning person.</i>

'Argh!'


Morning, honey.
Morning, mom.

You sleep well?

Yeah, I guess.
Hmm.

This will put
some pep in your step.

Kale juice, spinach juice,
celery juice.

Yeah.

Good? Drink up.
Mm.

So close, honey.
Ugh!

State championships
are just around the corner.

I think we can
win it all this year.

Mm, mm. Yeah, for-for sure.


<i>(Roger) And they think drinking
out of a toilet is gross.</i>

Listen,
I got an alert this morning

about your workout.

Noticed your footwork
was a little slow today.

I get an alert when you miss
your target numbers.

What else do you get updates on?

Your heart rate, how much time
you spend in the bathroom

your heart rate when
you spend time in the bathroom.

Boundaries, mom!
Just saying.

In case you want some more?
I know you like it.

Hmm.


[guitar music]


Morning, Zoe-Zoe.

Good morning.

Um, let me, make you breakfast.

It's okay. I got it.
I'll heat up burritos.

<i>(Gwen) You're probably
thinking, "Gwen, you're nothing</i>

<i>but a pampered,
sheltered, housecat."</i>

<i>And maybe you're right.</i>

No way!

You can heat those up?

No wonder mine
are always so crunchy.

<i>(Gwen) But one day,
we're gonna go outside</i>

<i>and have great
adventures together.</i>

<i>Don't worry. I'll protect her.</i>

<i>I'm like a Ninja!</i>

[glass shatters]

<i>Ha! I'm okay!</i>

How was the gig last night?

Uh... fell through.

But I stayed in the coffee shop

and a new song came to me

like a gift from above.

That's great, dad.
Let's hear it.

Yeah, yeah, it's like, uh..

[guitar music]

â™ª Da da da da pa ra ra â™ª

â™ª Run run run â™ª

â™ª Gotta get away â™ª

â™ª Run run run â™ª

â™ª Show 'em something something â™ª

â™ª Run run run â™ªâ™ª

Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

See, the thing is,
I wrote the lyrics

down on a napkin
and then I forgot

and then I blew my nose

and then I put it in my pocket

and then it was just a mushy

snotty, gooey.

Nothing.
Okay.

It'll come back to you.
Yeah.

Yeah.

Don't forget, dad.

A million people
bought your first album.

Twenty years ago.

Eddie Vedder says you're
the grungiest guy in grunge.

Eddie Vedder.

Ah! Hot.

You got asbestos fingers?

Hot, hot, hot.
How do you do that?

Ah!

Mm!

Now it tastes so much better.

Dad, don't give up.

Promise?

I promise.

[instrumental music]

Bye, Gwen. Have a good day.

Bye. Love you.
Bye! Love you.

[door shuts]



[mellow music]

â™ª Hey now we'll walk
through a fire â™ª

â™ª Just to bring you the ring â™ª

â™ª Obstacles are only rocks
for the calm â™ª

â™ª It's a race
against the clock â™ª

â™ª And you've got
the perfect timing â™ª

â™ª Bring the thunder so we all
be castin' lightning â™ª

â™ª The only thing that cuts
diamond is diamond â™ª

Wait! Hold up there!

â™ª And I've been waiting
all my life â™ª

â™ª Just for this one night â™ª

Thanks.

I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

Whatever, dude. You do you.

â™ª I got the heart
of a champion â™ª

â™ª And I will â™ªâ™ª

[upbeat music]





[music continues]

<i>(Roger)
As you may have guessed</i>

<i>we are not your average pets.</i>

We are two of the baddest,
most kick-butt

FART agents you've ever seen.

Actually, we're just

risk assessment analysts.

[automated voice]
Please say the password.

Beethoven.
Incorrect.

Uh, Rin Tin Tin.
Wrong.

Air Bud.
Not even close.

Snoopy?
Negative.

Old Yeller?
Incorrect.

Scooby Doo?

Uh, Garfield.

[automated voice]
You got it, sister!

Seriously?

[clicks tongue]
I put in a request.

[upbeat music]

Hey, how was the
night shift, old Ed?

Well, back's a little stiff.

I've been meaning to order
one of those standing desks.

I meant with the monitoring.

Well, mostly,
I've been just been watching

these bubbles
float across the screen.

Hey, Ed, that's screensaver.

Oh, you and your fancy
high-tech gadget.

In my day,
we had to trust our instincts

'and communicate, and we were
out there on the streets!'

Oh! I wish they'd
sent us out in the field.

I'm dying to see some action.

We're just monitors.

Yeah! And how boring is that?

It's like I always say..

...boring is good.

Not.


Ah! Roast beef.

Ugh, I'm not gonna even ask.


on the flippity flop.


Monitors 44871 and 44872

logging in for Zone-867.

The F.A.R.T. system's
functioning flawlessly

and the worldwide threat level
remains at low.

Copy that, chief. Great news.

Yeah. If you like
rotting away at a desk.

Uploading your links now.

Carry on, monitors.

HQ out.

[buttons beeping]

Really?

with dogs and trees?'

Very complex.

Your kind would never grasp it.

Ah! Yes, yes,
you're absolutely right.

How could we possibly understand

such a sophisticated ritual?

Hold the phone. Got a canine
near the animal hospital.


Oh, I bet
he's planning something.

Just a stray.
'Looks suspicious to me.'

Could be a serious plot
against feline patients.

Ah! Not the diaper,
not the diaper!

'And... the diaper.'

Ugh! Oh!

Oh, I'm gonna be sick.
Let me guess.

Too complex
for my kind to grasp?

Nope. That's just disgusting.


Nothing exciting
ever happens anymore.

You guys have all the fun.

Take it from someone who knows

there was nothing fun

about those major plots
back in the day.

Lot of good agents,
both dog and cat

got injured, or worse.

Oh, wait. You saw some action?

Enough to know
it wasn't for me.

At least you were out there.

Hey! You ever
gave anyone the old..



What the feline is that?

[alarms blaring]

Initiate reboot protocol.
Initiating.

Probably a power failure.

(Pablo on PA)
'In case you're wondering'

'this is not a power failure.'

'But <i>failure'</i>

'is the perfect word
to describe'

'what's just happened'

'to your labyrinth
monitoring system.'

'I've shut out
all communications'

'from your headquarters
to every other station'

'in your network.'

'Just try and control
your FART now!'

Well, dude, that was a thing.

What's goin' on?
Who's doing this?

(Pablo on PA) 'I am the
most nefarious villain'

'the world has ever seen!'


Is that it? Is he done?

This is not good!

Honestly, I thought
the laugh was kind of weak.

I'm thinking needy
with self-esteem issues.

Probably a chihuahua or smaller.

(Pablo on PA)
'I'm still here!'

'I accidentally hit
the mute button.'

'Just know that
as you sit there helplessly'

'in your secret bunkers
all over the planet'

'my brilliant plan
is already sending'

'the world of dogs and cats
into chaos!'

Chaos? What kind of chaos?




You don't get away with it.'

(Pablo on PA)
'I already have.'

[evil laughter]

We gotta do something.

You canines
designed this system.

Tell me you butt-sniffers
have a backup plan.

Uh..

Oh, dear God. We're doomed.

[traffic bustling]

That's it, honey.

(male #1)
'Let's go, Max.'

That's it, kiddo.

'Follow through.'

Force him to use your back hand.

Forehand, Max, forehand.

Nice swing.

[blows whistle]

Power shot, power shot!

All eyes will be on the State
Tennis Tournament next week

as the boys gun
for the championship.

Led by local phenom

Max Harper.

'Max will try to complete
an undefeated regular season'

against Central High tomorrow

as a tune-up before
the State championships.

Follow through!
Pull over your shoulder.

Susan!

You know how I feel about you
coaching during practice.

I'm the coach.
I've got the hat.

You ordered that hat
off the internet.

I'm gonna have to ask
for the whistle too.

But, ya-uh, I'm keeping the hat.

[instrumental music]

[car horn honking]

[Max grunts]

Hey, honey.

The biggest problem with FART,
besides the obvious

is that it was designed by dogs!

We never would have needed FART

if you cats
weren't always plotting

and scheming
and trying to disrupt

nature's intentions.

Nature's intentions?

Three words, hair ball.

"Man's best friend." Period.

That's four words. Catnap!


Whoa! Where were we?

[telephone ringing]

Whoa! What is it?

[telephone ringing]

What are you doing?
That thing may be about to blow.

Why did you do that for?

Sorry. Couldn't help myself.
'Hello.'

'Hello? Pick up the phone.'
Hey, wait.

'Is anyone there?'
I think it's talking.

(Schnauzer on phone) 'Answer this
phone, you nincompoops!'

That sounds like the chief.
'It is the chief!'

Whoa! How about that?
It's a phone!

'High tech, no buttons.'

(Schnauzer on phone)
'We've been hacked!'

'Someone has shut down
our online systems.'

'This old landline is the
only way we can communicate.'

Who do you think is responsible?

(Schnauzer on phone)
'We have no idea.'

'But a crime like this has'

'Mr. Tinkles and Kitty Galore'

'written all over it.'

Knew it. Always the cats.

Watch who you're accusing,
mister!

Or what?

(Schnauzer on phone)
'Stop it, you two!'

'It appears
they have done something'

'that increases the hatred'

'between cats
and dogs everywhere.'

'It's clearly affecting
both of you already.'

Not me. He started it!

Did not.
Did too!

(Schnauzer on phone) 'Enough!
Hit the big red button!'

[instrumental music]

(Schnauzer on phone)
'Open it and eat one now!'

'Each of you.'

'They've been
specially modified'

'with lavender, valerian root'

'and passion flower.'

Hmm. What do they do?

in their beta phase.'

'But if they work properly'

'you should notice
your disdain for one another'

'begin to wear off.'

So, you want us
to be your test monkeys?

After you.
No.

After <i>you.</i>
No, no, no, no.

Doggies first.
Oh, no, please.

After you.
Rock, paper, scissors for it?

You're on. One, two, three!

What is that?
Is that a rock?

(Schnauzer on phone)
'Ah! Just do it!'

[instrumental music]

I owe you an apology.

Apology accepted.

Ooh! Your coat is so soft.

And your breath smells like
freshly mowed grass.

(Schnauzer on phone) 'We haven't
studied any long term effects yet.'

'But they should keep you guys
from killing each other'

'while you solve this case.'

Did you say <i>we</i> solve the case?
'Yes!'

(Schnauzer on phone) 'We may not
know who is behind this plot'

'but we do know where.'

'Before our computers went down'

'they were able to pinpoint
the origin of the hack!'

'It came from your zone.'

'The perpetrator
we're looking for'

'is within a five block radius'

'of where you're sitting
right now!'

Yes! We're on it, chief.

W-w-wait a second.
We're not field agents.

We're just monitors.

Who are you sending
to take a lead on this?

Who's in charge?

(Schnauzer on phone)
'Bottom line, this starts'

'and ends with you two.'

'You need to put together
a support team'

'from within your building.'

'We cannot trust outsiders.'

From within this building?

But there are only
a few other cats and dogs

that live here and
none of them have any training.

(Schnauzer on phone) 'Well,
it's up to you two to get them ready.'

'We don't stop this now'

'it could lead
to an all-out war'

'between cats and dogs.'

'The fate of canines
and felines everywhere'

'is in your paws!'

'HQ out!'

[instrumental music]

[car engine sputters]

I thought we were doing okay.

Dad, I mean
with your song royalties.

We are okay, Zoey

and we're gonna be okay, just..

...things have been a little
slow lately, that's all.

I can help.

I can get a job at the mall
or babysit.

No, no, no.
This is not your responsibility.

The only thing is..

...we may have to find
a smaller place.

Or a bigger car

with an actual backseat.

You mean, move again?

Well, just to save on rent.

But same neighborhood,
same school.

And pets, right?

I just started looking, Zoey.

We'll-we'll do the best we can.

Hey.

We're gonna be fine.

Okay?

I gotta go see about a job.

What kind of job?

A-a studio musician?

Live performance?

Um, not exactly.

'There's pasta in the fridge.'

I know. I cooked something.

Movie at 7:00?
Movie at 7:00.

Oh, hey, hey, hey!

Don't forget your guitar.

Love you.
Love you too. Bye!

Bye!


(man on TV)
'That's all the money I've got!'

Solving this caper,
we're gonna need a crew.

Qualified,
dependable specialists.

Oh, a computer expert,
a getaway driver

and master of disguise.

What are we, robbing a casino?

This is my first assignment,
okay?

Give me this!

we can only use pets

from within this building.

We've got old Ed,
but besides him..

...not a lot of options.

<i>(Roger)
There's Clyde in 6D.</i>

<i>(Gwen)
He wears a diaper!</i>

He can track someone's scent

from a mile away.

Doggie diaper. Enough said.

Um, well, how about Zelda

<i>on the fourth floor?</i>

<i>(Gwen)
Nope, cross her path</i>

<i>seven years, bad luck.</i>

Um, isn't that a broken mirror?

You want to take that chance?

Lexie in the penthouse?

<i>(Gwen)
What animal allows a human</i>

<i>to dress her?
No self-respect.</i>

<i>(Roger)
Anastasia? Leopold? Maximus?</i>

Worms, fleas,
explosive diarrhea.

And that's just Anastasia.


Okay, so that just leaves..

[all screaming]


<i>(Roger)
...Duke.</i>

Looks like we found our muscle.

Scared to death of that guy,
by the way.

Does he even speak?

<i>(Roger)
No one knows.</i>

So, that's our crew?

<i>You, me, old Ed and Duke?</i>

That's right.

The greatest team

the world has ever seen.

Catnap!


Oh, brother.
Now, let's do this!

[instrumental music]

'Thank you.'
Alright.

[door shuts]

[instrumental music]

[birds chirping]

[upbeat music]


[all chanting]
Pablo! Pablo!

Pablo! Pablo!

Pablo! Pablo!

Pablo! Pablo!

Yes. Thank you, yes!

Thank you. Yes.

Thirty four cans
will be a new world record.

(male #2)
'Go, Pablo! You can do it!'

Go, Pablo, go!

'You can do it!'

'Ha-ha! Yeah!'

'Take to the skies, boss!'

'Take to the skies!'

Oh! Ow! Ow! Ooh!


[Pablo groans]

Getting closer, boss.


Ah! Oh!

'Ow! Ah!'


So, Zeek..


The head honcho around here

'is a parrot
who can almost fly?'

'Maybe we should
nominate a fish'

'who can almost swim.'

I'm a cockatoo!

You're new to our organization.

Pets with out-of-the-ordinary
pedigree

or, POOP, for short.

So, I'll let you
slide this one time.

'The owner clips my wings'

to keep me from
flying off my perch!

Tell me, wise guy

you planning on going
to a loving family soon?

Maybe a kid to play with?
Great food?

Reverse osmosis water?
Aren't we all?

Shirley,
how long you've been here?

Agh! 15 months.

<i>Sacrebleu.</i>

Zeek, how about you?

Six hundred and twelve days.

Me? I've been here six years!

And never once taken home
as a pet.

In fairness, you guys
live up to a hundred years.

Who wants to make
that kind of commitment?

Listen, ten legs

do you know

how many puppies and kittens

have found homes

during that time?

Millions!

I don't understand.

I thought humans loved all pets.

Not as much as cats and dogs.

Which is why they're all

at the front
of the store, not us.

We're stuck back here
in the aisles

of chew-toys

and mice!

You have no idea
what that's like.

Any puppies or kittens?

No, just a bunch of weird stuff.

Funny-looking reptiles

and dopey birds.

Dopey birds.'

'Dopey birds.'

[dramatic music]

We secondary pets
never stood a chance.

Especially after they started
their worldwide

peace-keeping organization.

But as I stood on my stoop
year after year..

...eyeballing
the store computer

I came up with the idea

<i>of using online piracy</i>

<i>to hack into their
F.A.R.T. system!</i>

Oh! Diabolical!

nerd sidekick Zeek'

<i>developed the frequency
that makes cats and dogs</i>

<i>even more vicious
to each other!</i>

<i>The signal is being sent now
all over the world</i>

<i>via Wi-Fi and cell towers.</i>

'That little phone controls'

'the fate of cats and dogs'

<i>everywhere!</i>

<i>As we speak,
cats and dogs everywhere</i>

<i>are at each other's throats</i>

<i>creating mayhem and chaos!</i>

<i>Soon, they will be
rejected too.</i>

<i>Abandoned by their humans
and they will feel</i>

<i>what it is like
to be unwanted.</i>

To be unloved!


[dogs barking]



Not now, Roger.

'Sorry, I'm late.'

Roger!

Who's a good boy?

Who's a good boy, huh?

So... are you ready
for the big match tomorrow?

I guess.
'You guess?'

You've already beat
this kid twice.

You shouldn't
even break a sweat.

Uh, hey, uh

after the match,
some of the boys in the team

wanna go hit
the Go-Kart track.

I thought maybe I could too.

Oh, sweetie..

...you know you've got
a full schedule.

Ice bath, massage

film session, practice.

Right. I-it's just..

[mellow music]

Forget I said anything.

Okay.


[guitar music]

â™ª I should've stopped â™ª

â™ª When I had the chance â™ª

â™ª Now I'm in a no man's land â™ª

No man's land.

â™ª I never never never â™ª

â™ª Wanna believe it â™ª

â™ª I never never never â™ª

â™ª Thought I could leave this â™ª

â™ª Run run â™ªâ™ª

Do you like that?

Yeah?


'Hey, Zoe-Zoe.'
Hi, dad.

Please tell me
you're not selling used cars.

Customer service representative.

Man, I didn't realize

how mean people could be.

Try spending a day
in my middle school.

Yeah.

I know that you own this house.

We just, we just
live here with you.


Huh? You've been playing?
Working on something?

No. Just messing around.

Oh. Cool.

Oh, thank you.

'So..'

...having a smaller apartment

much easier on the wallet.

But..

...we need to move right away

so we're not paying double rent.

They take pets, right?

Listen, I spoke with your
Aunt Lois

and she's happy to take Gwen

'and we can visit her
as often as we want.'

She lives two hours away!

Zoey, it's..

...it's not permanent.

You know, and... uh..

I don't know..


Can we sneak her in
for sleepovers?

Absolutely.

Right?


[upbeat music]


'Okay, now, listen up!'

Whoever's behind this plot

is somewhere in our zone.

It's up to us to find him or her

cat or dog.

Well, I've been
doing this a long time

and it's always a cat

stirring up trouble.

I'd say, let 'em clean up
their own mess this time.

Easy there, gramps.

It's just as likely
that dogs are behind this

just to make us cats look bad.

Gramps?

Yeah.

That's what I said.

Or do you need
some hearing aids?

Now, you listen, sassy pants.

I might be old, but these paws

still know how to fight!

Would you stop?
There's not time for this.

'Gwen mapped out our zone.'

down, right?'

So, we gotta go old school.

Tomorrow, I say

we hit the streets!

It's up to us now!

Nope. We're analysts.

We stay right here
in our building

and we monitor the action.

Don't participate in it.

Uh, boring is good.

Remember?

Well, someone out there
knows something

'and I am fully confident
this crew can find out.'

This brand new, how do you do

out of the blue,
cat and dog crew!

Is she okay?

She's just enthusiastic.

OMG! OMG!

O-M to the G!

This is really happening.

I am outside!

Yes, Seattle.
Outside and it's wet.

It's so much more
than I ever thought it would be.

It's, it's so big.

We're only 20 feet away from
the front door of the building.

There's actually a lot more.

Oh! Look at all this space!

'So much of space!'

Too much space!
Where are all the walls?

Danger!
Danger in every direction!

Gwen, keep it together,
we've got a mission to do.

Let's just...
'Animal control, 5 o'clock!'

'Our eye in the sky.'

And it's heading right at you.

[dramatic music]

Scramble! Hide!
Outside bad!

Outside bad!
Whose idea was this?

Oh, wait, wait, check that.

'False alarm on
the animal control truck.'

My bad.
Just the ice cream vendor.

Uh, uh, think you can
get me a drumstick?

I just love those things.


[instrumental music]

Before cameras and monitors
and gadgets

we got our information
from combin' the streets.

Like in a cop movie,
just gotta find us a snitch

'a pigeon, a weasel,
a blabbermouth.'

A cheese eater!
Oh! I think I see one.

Cover me.

[instrumental music]

Okay, ankle bitter,
who's behind the plot?

Oh, boy!
I'm on to you, cupcake.

And don't think I'm fooled
by the whole Toy Group routine.

Okay, a crafty one.

Guess I need to dispense
with my good cop.

Spill the beans, purse-pooch!

Or you start losin' digits.


Fingers or toes?


You think it was too much?

[siren wailing]

Hey, sarge, FART agent 44871.

What's the word on the street?

Little small for an agent.

I'm actually just a monitor.

Long story.
Lot of domestic calls.

Mostly cats and dogs
mixin' it up.

Destroyin' property.
You got any leads?

We narrowed it down to this zone

but the perp took out
our comm, so..

...we're hittin' the streets.

Shaggy dog, in the park.
One of our informants.

'Always has the 411.'


Tell her Buck sent ya.

Hey! Hey! Keep it off
the hydrants, buddy.

'Hey, shampoodle, glace it up.'

'Hey, buddy,
where's that collar?'

Consider this a warning.

Okay, executing covert approach.

Gotta be cool, not too obvious.

Oops, uh, comin' on too strong,
okay.

Back it up, reset,
acting normal.

Okay, not feeling normal.

What do normal dogs do?

They, they sniff trash cans.

Commence sniffing.

Ooh! Rotting chili dogs.

Better get in on this.

Hey, Shaggy, I hear you've got
a poopscoop around here.

I keep my eyes open.
Uh, well..

You see anything lately?

Couple of weeks ago,
I heard whispers

that someone was looking
to hire a job.

A hush-hush kind of a job.

So, who was it?
I don't know.

They were right next to me

and this may come
as a bit of a surprise

I didn't see their faces.

Huh, imagine that.
Ugh!

Bottom line, if you need
something done around this town

you go to the cats.

The cats?
The alley cats.

But they don't come out
till the sun goes down.


me, they will cower in terror.'

'They didn't think
I was worth loving'

'so now,
they will fear me instead!'

[all gasping]

Oh, no, no, no. Hey, boss.

That ain't workin' for you.

Really?
I thought hats were scary.

Um, not that one.
Okay. Okay.

Prepare to be scared
beyond your imagination.


[intense music]

No! You don't look scared!

Of a wizard parrot?
I'm a wizard cockatoo!

Oh, well, now I'm scared!


We are getting reports
of global unrest

developing in the pet world

as canines and felines
are suddenly quarreling

at unprecedented levels.

Just take a look at these videos
sent in from our local viewers.


'Wow!'

Glad you're not involved
in any of that mess.

Right, Gwen?

You have no idea.

Zero, zero, one,
four, nine, three.

'Yeah, a 2:00 p.m. showing,
okay?'

'I can confirm you?
Alright, thank you.'

'Okay, I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.'

How did it go, champ?

Six-three, six-three.
Wow.

You put up quite a fight today.

Still, a win's a win.

Yeah, um..

Actually, I lost.

You lost?
That's right.

Okay, uh..

We can just train
a little harder next time.

You know, we've been taking
Sunday mornings off

from practice,
maybe that was a mistake.

I don't know, mom, it's just..

Maybe I wasn't
feeling it today.

Well, no fever.

Good news is,
the team actually won.

The other guys pulled it for me,
so we're still undefeated.

Hm, well, that's a..

...silver lining I guess.


While it's not uncommon
to see behavioral changes

coincide with mating seasons
or even..

...weather patterns,
but we've never seen

anything like this.

Now, we're speaking with the
manager of the Paw street market

who's already seeing this
conflict impacting his business.

People are skipping
the puppies and kittens

'and taking home reptiles,
snakes and birds.'

'All much easier to care for.'

What about the fish?
Fish don't count.

[instrumental music]

Okay, come clean
about your field agent days.

What happened out there?

Look, it was a long time ago.

I made a mistake, and ever since

I've been behind a desk,
where I belong.

What kind of mistake?

There was a moment,
there's always a moment

and I hesitated.

My partner, my mentor got hurt.

I've never gotten over it.

But listen, we can't forget
that a pet's number one job

is to be there for their humans.

Okay, okay, you're right.

And my boy Max just hasn't
been himself lately.

I've been trying to help,
but he just

he doesn't have time
for me anymore.

Huh, well, my girl Zoey
has been going

through some tough stuff too.
We might have to move.

Max sure could use
someone to talk to.

Preferably someone
who could talk back.

Zoey doesn't have a friend
that understands her either.

She just spends most of her time
on her phone.

Huh, yeah, the phones.

Max turns into a zombie
when he stares at his.

Yeah, Zoey falls asleep
with hers

on the pillow right next to her.

You know, Max used to take me
to play fetch

at the park every night.

Have humans forgotten
that their stress goes down

when they engage
with their pets?

These kids don't even engage
with each other.

Max really needs
a friend like Zoey.

Zoey really needs a friend
like Max.

Meanwhile, a deranged villain

is trying to eliminate
cats and dogs

as human pets forever.

And the only lead we have
depends

on a shifty collection
of vile street cats

who would trade their
grandmothers for a dead mouse.

Why don't you let me
go talk to them?

Are you sure you're ready?

Are you kidding?
I was born ready!

[instrumental music]


Shh!
Sorry, it's, it's a dog thing.

We like to sing along.

I don't wanna do this.'

Uh, rock, paper, scissors?

Loser has to face 'em?

You're on! One, two, three!

I'm paper, you're rock. I win.

No, I'm scissors. I win!

That's not scissors.
How can that be scissors?

That's totally scissors.

If you're gonna throw out
scissors

you've got to grow out
those nails.


Oh! Oh!

[breathing heavily]

Remember,
you wanted some action.

This is what
you've always wanted.

Prepare yourself for some
disgusting frothing mongrels

munching on dead mice.

Filth upon filth. Oh!
'Psst!'

'Over here.'

Elon Musk? I-I'm looking
for the alley cats?


(male #3)
'Then it's your lucky day.'

You're an alley cat?

(male #3) 'Why don't you
step into my office?'

You mean, come into the light?

I thought you guys
usually slept outside.

Drank out of puddles,
ate dead mice.

We did, until some rich doofus

started parking his Tesla
in our alley

and leaving the windows down.

Well, I was told by a shaggy dog

that you might have
information about a job

that was done around here?

Uh, keep it on the down-low
kinda job.

Of course, I do.
I'm the one who did it.

You?
That's right.

And I was paid handsomely
for it.

With money?

No, what would a cat do
with money?

I got this shiny ball
of tinfoil. Duh!

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Fun! Ooh!

[clears throat]
Who hired you?

Don't know.

They communicated
electronically.

Sending text messages
about a covert mission.

So, what was the mission?

I snuck into the headquarters

of a wireless phone company

got some codes
off their computers.

What kind of codes?

Wi-Fi and cellular access codes.

just to get some free internet.

Ooh!

[clears throat]
It's just so shiny. Hm!

(Schnauzer on phone)
'Oh! It's an epidemic!'

'Humans are returning
their cats'

'and dogs by the millions.'

'Tell me you've made
some progress.'

We've gathered some intel

but I have no idea
how the pieces fit yet.

Well, l-let's start with this.
What do we know?

(Schnauzer on phone) 'Well,
we know some maniac out there'

'has found a way
to ramp up aggression'

'between cats and dogs.'

And we know he shut down
our entire system

designed to prevent such plots.

And we know someone hired
the alley cats

to steal access codes
for Wi-Fi and cell towers.

And one thing has never made
sense to me.

This plot is devastating
to both cats and dogs.

What kind of lunatic
would device a plot

that hurts all of us?

Well, hard to read the mind
of a lunatic.

Especially a cat lunatic.

Or a dog lunatic.

Maybe we need to think
outside the box.

No, what if it's neither
cat or dog lunatic?

Hm?

Who stands to gain
from humans walking away

from cats and dogs?

Other pets.

So we possibly have a rouge
secondary pet

who's bent on pushing
cats and dogs aside

as mankind's favorite.

(Schnauzer on phone)
'Good working theory, agents.'

Agents! He said agents!

But how can he possibly
be reaching

virtually every cat and dog
on the planet?

Through the food? Water?

Wait! That's it!

Wi-Fi cell towers, he doesn't
care about receiving internet

he cares about sending
frequencies.

You mean like hate frequencies?

That only effect
cats and dogs.

I knew technology was evil!

(Schnauzer on phone) 'Now get to
work figuring out who's behind it.'

'We're clearly dealing
with a ferociously'

'frightening criminal.'

[instrumental music]

â™ª Oh lookin' lookin'
lookin' good â™ª

â™ª Yes I'm hot â™ª

â™ª I knew I would â™ª

â™ª This is fire baby â™ª
â™ª Burn it up burn it up â™ª

â™ª Lookin' good â™ª

â™ª So tight â™ª
â™ª Lookin' lookin' lookin' good â™ª

â™ª I'm lookin' good
lookin' lookin'.. â™ªâ™ª

none of these looks are befitting

the most nefarious villain

the world has ever seen!

No one is afraid
of a cockatoo in a hat!

I need a totally new look.

A costume that sends shivers
up the spine.

Sir, it is ready.

The costume you have been
waiting for.

Yes! My robotic mechanical
dog suit!

Finally, the world will cower
when faced

with my slobbering beastliness!

Reveal it to me.

Feast your eyes
on my greatest invention.

Looks so real!

'You wanna take her for a ride?'

Yes. Zip me up inside.

'Time for a test drive.'

Now that I'm outside..

...I must test the full
capabilities of this machine.

'Let's see,
what does this one do?'

Okay. What about this one?

And this one?

'This one?'

[Pablo screaming]

[Pablo groaning]

I just threw up!

But I swallowed it.

[mellow music]



Some other time, Roger.


You know, you're just, uh..

...you're in a little slump.

'It happens to everyone.'

We just have to decide
how to get you out of it.

Maybe a new racquet might help.

Huh?
Something with a bit more power?

Wow. Uh, thanks, mom.

You know, we could, uh, re-watch
the Australian final

between Federer and Nadal.

'That always fires you up,
right?'

Hey, Rog, you like your
breakfast? That's a good boy!

You know, we could also
watch the video footage

of my over-40's club match
against Sheila Smithers

when I took her down
in straight sets.

She was pregnant.
Who knew?

With triplets.
Yeah, okay.


Listen, Max, you know I am
so very proud of you, right?

No matter what.
I know, mom.

I'll figure it out.
Okay. Eat up, champ.

[instrumental music]

Yeah, let me, uh, let me help
you with those, sweetie.

After I..

After I take a break.

Dad, we can't move all of this
stuff to a smaller apartment.

We need to make choices.
You're right.

Okay, um..

Trash or treasure?
Treasure.

That's my high-school flannel.

Alright.
Treasure.

It's my college flannel.

Treasure, it's my unemployed
starving artist flannel.

I think we should treasure
the whole box.

We should treasure every moment,
actually label it

treasure. What else?

What about these records?
No! No, no, no!

We can't throw those out.
Are you kidding me?

Neil Young, Live Rust,
that like a..

...a rock and roll holy relic.

Psst! Psst!


Get over here!

Ah! You don't have to blind me!

Oh, here's a London band,
sort of little known.

I don't know,
the Rolling Stones.

'Okay, what's the shape
of this album?'

Octagon! What does that say?
Stop!

'That's what it means.'

Gotta keep these,
speakin' of which..

...where's your record
collection?

Here.
Are you crazy?

They're both home!
I think I have a fix.

Meet me in the hall.
Oh, and Zoey's phone, hide it!

What?
Just do it.

We're gonna give our humans
the friends

that we can't be right now.

[instrumental music]

[elevator bell dings]


Come on.

[music continues]


[elevator bell dings]

Uh, hey,
I left my phone upstairs.

Mind if we go back up
so I can grab it?

Fine.
Thanks.

I think I forgot mine, too.


Thirsty?

Just gotta hydrate.

My mom likes me to get
at least 64 ounces before lunch.

What the..

[instrumental music]

'Hello! Somebody!'
'Hey!'

'Can you hear us? Hello!'
'Anybody out there? Hey!'

Hello!

Come on.

just a minute or two.

What are the chances?

We both forgot our phones today.

I know. Great.


I don't even care if I miss
my tennis lesson this morning.

Really? I thought you, like,
ate, drank and breathe tennis

with every inch of your soul.

Yeah, well, I thought I did too.

I mean, I even named my dog
Roger, after Federer.

I don't know,
recently, it's been feeling

more like a job than a hobby,
you know?

Dude, a bit of unsolicited
advice..

Hit me.

Chill, chill and chill!

Really? Even that last one?

Especially that last one.


So where were you off to
this morning?

Guitar lessons?

Um, no.

We're moving tomorrow
and we're packing boxes.

I just needed a break.

You're moving, like,
out of town?

No. We're just downsizing,
I guess.

Same school, new building
doesn't allow pets.

You, you have a cat, right?

Gwen, as in Stefani.

Music's kind of our thing.

Wasn't your dad a musician?

He is a musician.

[instrumental music]

How long do we leave 'em
in there?

Until they realize
they're actually friends.


What? I told you
we like to sing along.

[brakes screech]

[brakes screech]

Notice anything weird
about that ice cream truck?

Uh, the terrible driving?

Yeah, and it never
actually stops.

It's like, it's always there,
just watching us.

I'll go check it out and, uh,
hey, maybe grab a drumstick.


Something's not right.
I've got a bad feeling.

Whoa!
Ed!

Oh, no.
Ed, no!

'That was too easy.'

'Your smartest agent
just walked into my trap.'

Ed!

[Pablo laughing]

Ed! Ed!

Good luck finding me now, bird brains.'

He has been watching us
this whole time.

Just, just playing with us.

We're in over our head
with this guy.

He's in complete command.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

Gas.

No, wait. Brakes!

Gas.

Brakes! Brakes!

Oh, no, a roundabout.

These things always confuse me.

Uh, maybe I should take over.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Okay. Okay.

Let me help.

pedals, lizard brain.'



Anything?
It's pitch black.

Wait, I got a,
I got a flash on my..

...phone.

It's great effort, but I think
it's time to come..

Whoa!

...down.

Ow!
Here, quick.

You okay?

Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Fine.


Um, zucchini kale bite?

"No gluten, no dairy

no soy, no grains, no sugar."

And no taste.

[dramatic music]

Uh-oh.
What's "uh-oh?"

Oh, gosh, maybe you're a little
too hydrated?

You can never be too hydrated.

Unless you're stuck
in an elevator.

Well, you have to hold it.

I-I don't think I can.

Now we have a real emergency.


Uh! We lost him.

Wait. Maybe not.

[Ed howling]

[dogs howling]


We just have to
follow the sound.

[Max sighs]

Okay, you gotta distract me.

Okay, um, what do you have
planned in the summer?

Uh, I'm supposed
to go to a tennis camp

but, you know, recently,
uh, uh..

What are you doing?

I'm going white water rafting
with my dad.

I love being out on the water

in the water, anything
water related really.

Not helping.
Sorry.

[dogs howling]

Ooh, ice cream truck,
6 o'clock.

[dramatic music]

Ed!



I knew you'd find me.

Nice instincts on the howling,
by the way.

Gotta get you untied.
There's no time.

But..
'And Roger..'

...there will be a moment.

'And there's always a moment
that you'll need'

to make a split second decision.

Don't hesitate.

Whoever kidnapped me
went inside the pet store.

Now get in there
and stop that low life.


Okay, so..

...why are you moving?

My dad hasn't come out
with a new song in a while.

He doesn't think he has anything
to say to the young audience.

And I had this crazy idea.

Like, maybe I could
write him one

and revive his career.

Truthfully, we're not moving.

We were evicted.

I'm sorry, I didn't...
No, no, it's-it's fine.

I mean, I'm here
about to pee my pants

and I'm blabbering about
my stupid tennis stuff is..

It's not stupid.

I'm glad you did.

I feel like people assume things
about others.

You know?
For sure.

I mean, it's like, no one
actually really talks anymore.

This is probably the longest

I've gone without being
on my phone.

It's kind of nice, isn't it?

Actually having a conversation.

Yeah.

Oh, God.. Okay.

You gotta distract me.

Let's hear it.
Hear what?

The song. The one you're writing
for your dad.

Absolutely not.

Do you have something more
important planned

while we're stuck here
in this elevator?

No, but i-it's just..

Dude, a bit of
unsolicited advice?

You made me realize
I was overdoing my talents.

I think you're maybe
under doing yours.

This is stupid.
Come on.

You've got this.

[guitar music]

â™ª Run run run â™ª

â™ª Run run run.. â™ªâ™ª

[siren blaring in distance]

[dramatic music]

[indistinct chatter]

[door closes]

'Ah! Like clockwork.'

Lured them right into my trap.

Zeek, clear the store.


[alarm ringing]

I'm really sorry, everyone.
We gotta leave.

Depart the premises right now,
everybody, please.

Please.
Let's go.

Where's my son?
Let's go. Sorry.

I'm sure he's outside.

What's going on?
Is there a fire?

It's a diversion. Be careful.

It might be a trap.

Okay, let's go.

[dramatic music]

Come on, you two.

Right behind you.

[alarm ringing]

[dramatic music]

Now, remember, it could be
any type of horrible animal.

A rat, python..

Or a parrot!

Aren't you a cockatoo?

Argh, the name's Pablo.

But you might know me better as

the most nefarious villain

the world has ever seen!


You?
Yes.

Perhaps you'll remember me.

After all, I watched you, Roger

get adopted
from this very store.

Uh, not ringin' any bells.
Really?

I was in the cage
right across from you.

I told you knock-knock jokes
on occasion.

Still nothin'.
I mean..

I was right in the cage.
But why?

[clears throat]
Why wouldn't I?

After all you've done to us.

What we've done?

And now it's time to pay!

Zeek, release our comrades.


[dramatic music]

Freedom!

Alright, let's go.

'Let's go.'

[indistinct chatter]


Okay, big guy,
you're our enforcer.

Time to start enforcing.


â™ª Lovely fluffy tarantula â™ª

â™ª Went up the water spout â™ª

â™ª Out came the rain and.. â™ªâ™ª


Ahh!
Get that thing away from me!

I'm allergic to spiders!

Hey, our enforcer speaks.

Yeah. Bone-chilling.

With that settled, it's time
to plan your big trip.

Trip?
'Trip?'

[instrumental music]


Hey. Someone in there?

Yes, we're stuck.

Please help us!
Please!

Okay.

Just give me a minute.

[both sigh]

Finally.

Quite the adventure, huh?

Yeah.

I'm, uh, I'm so glad I finally
got to know each other.

Yeah, me too. Thanks.

Thank you.

[mellow music]


Uh..

I guess he fixed it.

Yup.

Uh..

I, uh, I better
go take Roger out.

Yeah, you dog people
have to do that, don't you?

Mm-hmm.

[chuckles softly]

Can I come?

Yeah, yeah, of course.

Oh, sorry about that.

'Roger!'

Rog!

I'm home!

That's strange.
Where could he be?

Do you think your mom took him?

No. She's gone all day.

Rog!
Do they do this a lot?

Never. I..

What?

Uh, Roger has a GPS
on his collar

we can find him.


Oh, okay. He's not that far.
Come on.

I gotta drop off my guitar.

Stairs.
Yeah, stairs.

[alarm ringing]

In case, you have any ideas
about escaping..

I think you'll enjoy
island life.

Island? What island?

Aldabra Island, Indian Ocean.

Sunshine, sandy beaches

crystal blue waters.

Hm. Sounds kinda nice.

And no humans!



Whoa-oh.
Ho-hold on, hold on.

I-I don't get it.

We've done nothing to you.

Oh, but you have.

While you cats and dogs
were keeping the peace

with your worldwide FART system

rest of us pets sat

'day after day,
month after month'

and in my case,
year after year

waiting for human owners

that never came.

That's what this is about?

That's exactly
what this is about.

[alarm ringing]

It says he's in here.

Hey, what's going on?

Wait until they all clear.

Can't let you in.
Could be a fire in there.

In need to go inside.
My dog is in there.

No can do.

You said it yourself.

You've never been a pet.

So you don't know
what that bond is like.

I don't believe in that anymore.

And maybe you'll stop
believing, too.

'After yearning to be a pet'

'day after day
and year after year'

'on an island
where the only humans'

are skeletal remains

of long dead explorers.

Close up the crates!

So we can bid a fond farewell

to the failed cats and dogs
of Zone 867.

[alarm ringing]

Hey, I said don't go
in there, you rebels.

Uh, they'll be fine.

We've got company.

That's Max.
And Zoe.

'They tracked my GPS collar.'

Max must've noticed I was gone.

He still does care about me.

Stop him, girls.



[intense music]

Roger!
Rog!

Roger!

Humans are gonna save us.

Get rid of the humans!

I'll do better than that.

I did some late night research

that revealed frequencies

impacting the human brain.

[high pitched sound]


Geez! What is that?

[all screaming]

Ow!


Mom.


Stop it.
You're hurting them.


Close up the crates!

Well, my work here is done.

So I'm gonna make
like a bulldog and flee.

Flee. Get it? Flee?


Anyway, you all
have a nice trip.

Zeek, bring me
my iron dog suit.


[Roger grunting]

What now?
'No one hurts my human.'

Oh, my head. Ah! My head.

I just need a minute.


'I'm with you, partner.'

'If my Zoe's in trouble'

'I'd run through a brick wall
for her.'

'Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh!'

'Ooh! Ow!'

'Why couldn't you've locked us
in a paper sack?'

Didn't want you
to get a paper cut.


Nobody hurts my friends' humans.

Thanks, big guy.
Yeah, I got your back, kid.

This is so annoying.



You really care about them
that much?

We would do anything for them.
That's what pets do.

Just like they would do
anything for us.

Ow!

Ow.

[mellow music]

Hello.


Yeah. Okay.

Uh, what is this thing
I'm feelin'?

It's so... strange.

It's called affection.

It's what people do
for the pets they love.

You're a cool bird.

I'm, I'm enjoyin' it.

Enough of this!

Want me to turn up the frequency

and get that clingy,
foolish bugs off you?

No, turn it off! Let them go!

I'm a changed bird.

I-I've seen the light
at the end of the cage.

What?
What?

By the way, animals talkin',
our little secret, okay?

I got you, super bird.

Super bird? Oh..

I didn't study code
every night for two years

to watch you go soft on me.

That was not the plan.

Yeah, well, you didn't
make the plan.

I did.

I have a new purpose now.

Everyone should feel
the love of a human.

You're not going anywhere.

[device beeping]

[alarm blaring]

What are you doing? It's over.

So hand me the phone and get
ready for your new family.

I don't want a family.

And I don't wanna be trapped
in a tiny space

being force-fed crickets.

Okay, well, then
what do you want?

I want it all.

'Reptiles once ruled
the planet unopposed.'

We were here millions
of years before dogs.

Before cats, before anyone!

Not before fish!

Fish don't count.

It's time my reptilian brothers
and I once again

take our place at the top
of the food chain!

The top? That would mean that...

Exactly!
Zeek.

I order you to stop.

Bird frequency, anyone?


I gotta do somethin'.

'I gotta get to that phone.'

No, you won't make it.

There's always a moment

and this is that moment.

Cover me, partner.

Did you just call me partner?

I'm goin' for that phone.


Now that's a field agent.


Okay, girls, ready to rumble?

But first, catnap.


JK, JK.

Tap and out!
Told you I was a ninja.

Want some more of this,
cream-puff?

Oh, not again.

That's what I thought.
160 pounds of pure whiskey..



It's all mine now.


No.

No parachute!


better be up to date.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Okay. Okay.

How about that? I can fly!

If you know what's good for you,
you'll bring me that phone.

What are you doing?

Cats and dogs and humans.
Back to normal.

No!

All pain frequencies erased.

And I just disabled
your GPS micro chip.

Your owners won't know
what happened.

Are you okay?
Yeah. And you?

Yeah.


Whoo.

[indistinct chatter]

What was that?

Wait, Roger's GPS collar,
it's gone.

Disa-disappeared.

So, he's not inside.

Stupid phone.

Probably didn't even work
in the first place.

Didn't I tell you
not to go in there?

Should we head back
to the house?

Yeah.

Just ignore me.

There you are.

I saw the coolest bird.
Oh, a bird?

Dude, it's an emergency,
off the phone.

Yeah.

Alright, everyone,
sorry about that.

Do with me what you want.

This is not over.

Oh, I think it is.


Case closed, lizard.

What? No.

I think it's finally time
I retire.

There's always a moment.

Right, old buddy?

'Wait, your old partner'

your mentor, that was Ed?

I always knew he was
a field agent.

Just had to make sure he knew.

Tell me somethin', Ed.

Uh, did you get captured
on purpose?

Just wanted a drumstick.

So what about him?

Like I said, we'll talk
to headquarters

'see if they can help him
find a home.'

And him?

If you don't mind, I may
have a home for him too.

Speaking of, we gotta get home
before Max and Zoe.

How are we gonna do that?

Oh, I got you.

I can help you there.

[upbeat music]

Paws at ten and two.


Uh-oh! Hit the brakes!

Brakes, brakes! Brakes?

[Gwen snoring]

Ah! I'm here, I think I need

a full 20 hours of sleep
tonight.

I can go for a long
catnap myself.


what are you doing in here?'

Gwen?

[Max chuckles]
That's a good boy, Roger.

How did he get in here?

I don't know.

'Hey.'
Dad.

Uh, this is Max from upstairs.

Hello.
Sir.

Hey. So..

Anything exciting happen today?

Um, actually, dad,
can you sit down?

There's something
I wanna show you.

Oh. Okay.

I've been working
on your song

and this is what I came up with.

[guitar music]

â™ª Run run run â™ª


â™ª Run run run â™ª

â™ª Run run run.. â™ª

Yeah.

<i>(Gwen) Turns out,
everyone found exactly</i>

<i>what they were looking for.</i>

â™ª Didn't follow the plan â™ª

â™ª I should've stopped
when I had the chance.. â™ª

<i>(Roger)
Like a well-deserved rest.</i>

<i>(Gwen)
Like new-found confidence.</i>

Zone 867, all clear
and looking good.

<i>(Roger)
Like refocused priorities.</i>

<i>[thinking]
Just chill.</i>

Come on, Max! You got this!

â™ª Time we disconnect â™ª

â™ª Run run run â™ª

â™ª Our minds are losin' this â™ª

â™ª Run run run â™ª

â™ª Say goodbye to this â™ª

â™ª Run run run â™ª

â™ª No I ain't looking back.. â™ª

That was amazing.

That's my boy.

Wow.
Yes.

Go, champion!

You got your tennis mojo back.

I just had to do it
on my own terms.

All I had to do was
chill, chill and..

Chill.

<i>(Roger)
Like just letting go.</i>

I believe that's yours.

Thank you.
Good job.

â™ª I never never never
wanna believe it â™ª

â™ª I never never never thought
I could leave this â™ª

â™ª Run run run
it's time we disconnect â™ª

â™ª Run run run
our minds are losin' this â™ª

â™ª Run run run
say goodbye to this.. â™ª

<i>(Roger)
Like a renewed career.</i>

â™ª Run run run
no I ain't lookin' back â™ª

[instrumental music]

<i>(Gwen)
Like home sweet home.</i>

<i>(Roger)
Or even like a new family.</i>

Looking good, super bird.

Pretty bird.
You're a pretty bird.

Pretty boy. Pretty mom.

'Pretty dog.'

So unusual.

'A dog who eats crickets.'

Let me out of this thing!

Not even funny.

<i>(Gwen) So, things are back to
normal, well, sort of.</i>

<i>(Roger) Oh,
we're still agents, we just</i>

<i>go about it
a little differently.</i>

<i>(Gwen)
Yeah, like, we still go outside</i>

<i>but for reasons
other than taking on</i>

<i>world conquering villains.</i>

<i>(Roger)
And as for technology</i>

<i>sure, there's a time and place
for it in our lives.</i>

<i>(Gwen) But we have to make a time
and a place for other things, too.</i>

â™ª Run run run say goodbye.. â™ªâ™ª

Outside good, outside good,
outside great.

Any action today?
No.

I haven't seen anything.

Pretty boring.

Like I always say,
boring is good. Hm?

Like you always say?

Hey, my phone.

Roger!

Gwen!

Good boy. Ready?
