Swore I would never go back

didn't know what I had

that feels like home

own but I wound up lost

to the foot of the cross

that feels like home.

Thank you, Lexi, for
sharing your beautiful voice

with us here.

A couple of announcements first.

A very special
announcement today.

One of our young people has
decided to serve our country.

Brandon, would you stand please?

Big on doubles.

Mr. Coleman just gave
me a hundred bucks.

No way, does he think
you're going on vacation?

Yeah.
Nice.

Hey.
Hey.

Super proud of you.

Thank you, sir.
Super.

And be safe, we're gonna
be praying for you.

And we'll be anxious

for you to get back.

Thank you.

"And if you're ever
feeling scared,"

"I will be right
there by your side."

Dad.

Yeah, honey.

What's an IAD?

IAD?

A boy in my class said his
uncle was killed by an IAD.

Oh.

You mean IED.

It's a homemade explosive
used by the bad guys.

Will they use one on you?

Your dad is gonna
be really safe.

And I'm gonna have a
lot of people around me

helping keep everyone safe.

It's really important
that you know that.

I'm going because
I want to serve.

I want to serve my country.

You know, it's only
hitting me just now.

I knew this moment would
come, but I just can't.

Hey, hey.

I'm gonna come back.

I really believe that this is
what God has called me to do.

And I can't explain how,

but I know he's
gonna protect me.

Oh ten-hut, hut, hut, hut.

Where's my bunk?

I have no idea.

What's up, dawg?
What's up?

Ten-hut.

What is this?

Take that horse crap off.

Suck it up.

What?

What is this?

Are you opening a candy
store, what are you doing?

What is this?

It's what I have,
Drill Sergeant.

What, are you laughing at me?

No, Drill Sergeant.

Do you find
something funny, son?

No, Drill Sergeant.

You know what I find funny?

You brought a tub.

You are Tubby.

That's it, Tubby.

And you, were you in
a motorcycle gang?

No, Drill Sergeant.
You're pretty boy.

You're pretty boy.

Get that off your head.

What is this, huh?

Whose is this?

Who?
Mine, Drill Sergeant.

What is this?

The Bible, Drill Sergeant.

Preacher, that's you.

Yes, Drill Sergeant.

I'm on to you, boy.

I got you later, boy.

Sergeant, take care of this.

Yes, Drill Sergeant.

What a mess, what a mess.

What are we gonna do with this?

You believe in this?

Yes, Drill Sergeant.

Turn to Jeremiah 5:20.

Read it.

"You are my war club,
my weapon for battle."

Louder.

"You are my war club,
my weapon for battle."

Louder.

"You on my war club,
my weapon for battle.

"With you, I shatter nations."

"With you, I destroy kingdoms."

Kingdoms, gentlemen.

We're gonna destroy
kingdoms, right?

Sir, yes, Sir.

Put that in your
locker, Preacher.

Do you believe in God?

God?

Yeah, man.

Yeah, I guess.

Hey, preacher, why don't
you read us a story,

help pass the time, huh?

This one's from
Philippians 4:13.

"I can do all things in
Christ, who gives me strength."

You're gonna need
some of that strength

to get old Tubby over
that wall outside.

Yeah, yeah, all
right, very funny.

Come on, let's go.

Go, get up, get up, again.

Get down.

Down.

Up, down.

Up.

Tubby, down, up.

Stay, I said stay up.

Get up, down.

Up, down.

Up, get it moving.

Come on, Tubby, you got it.

Get down, get down, go, let's
go, next room, next room,

Tubby, move, next room.

What is your goal?

Might as well pass this.

Hey.

I got you.

And for the man.

Oh and it's still hot.

You're like his best friend.

I'm listening guys.

Hey listen, I like Tootsie Roll.

Homemade chocolate.

Watch this.

With a Tootsie Roll?

With a Tootsie Roll, yes.

He does this all the
time, believe me.

You hear something,

take it out of the paper.

Swirl it.

I have never seen this
before my entire life.

You can be at that for hours

if you want that
to be chocolate.

I'm just so exhausted here.

I really miss you.

Make sure the kids know

I miss being at their
soccer games, okay.

Hey Daddy.

Hey sweetie, happy birthday.

How was the party?

It was good.

We took a lot of pictures
for mama to send you.

Oh that's great.

I really wish I could
have been there.

I got this new doll,
her name is Lily.

Then I also got this bike
helmet, the bikes outside,

but I can show you that later.

And I got this book
"A Little Princess."

I've been reading it to myself

and I'm on chapter three
and it's a great book.

And I love it.

Why don't you let me talk to
daddy for a little bit, okay.

Okay.

Bye Daddy, love you.

Yeah, I love you.

Hi Honey.

Oh, you look tired.

Yeah I am.

Last night we went
on a 3:00 a.m. run

then we went back to bed.

Yeah.

Listen, I have a
pretty good idea

of where they're sending
me when we finish.

I'll be rolling into
deployment like we thought.

I don't know what
communication's gonna be like

at that point, I'll
try to stay in touch.

I want you to know
how proud I am of you

and how proud your
father would be too.

Thanks.

So tell me more about
life back there.

Anything new with.

Hurry up Preacher.

Hey, I just sat down.

Preacher.

Yeah, Drill Sergeant's
nickname for me.

It's kind of caught
on with the guys too.

I don't know if it's the fear
of war or the lack of sleep,

most everyone here wants
to know more about God.

Well, do you think I
could send some bibles?

Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

I'd rather have the computer.

Ah, listen honey, I
better go, I love you.

I love you too.

Hey Preacher, I couldn't
help overhearing,

you told your wife you're
getting sent to the war.

That's the rumor, isn't it?

Well, yeah, but that's
just, it, it's a rumor,

there's nothing official yet.

Look, if it turns
out to be wrong,

I'll gladly call her back
and tell her the good news.

But until then, I don't
want to give her false hope.

Sometimes it helps to
prepare for the worst.

Sounds pretty cynical
for the bible guy.

Yeah, well, God doesn't
promise to do everything

the way we'd want him to.

All right, well then
what does he promise.

My wife's praying
for me to stay safe.

You think she should
just give that up?

Oh leave it alone, Tubby.

If you wanted a guarantee
of staying safe,

you really chose the
wrong line of work.

Fair enough, Captain.

Chris.

Chris.

What's up?

What's up man?

Chilling, chilling.

How you doing?

Hey.

Yeah.

You know they sending
us tomorrow right?

Yeah, yeah.

You okay?

I'm good, I'm good.

I'm just.

You know I love you right?

Yeah.

What you talking about?

Just wanted to tell you,

tell you I love you.

I love you too man.

You okay?

I'm okay, I'm good.

And Al-Qaeda
terrorists trained men.

In Afghanistan.

You know, I feel
like I'm going crazy.

It's been two years and I
still, in the morning, rollover

and I go to say something
to him and he's not there.

Have you heard any more news?

Any more news?

I've heard no news.

It's, "Call this number."

Where's my husband?

"Call this number."

Can I get a hold of my husband?

"Call this number?"

Is he alive?

"Call this number."

I get it.

I get it, it's war, but
I need to know something.

We're still praying for him.

Door rear to your left, one up.

Clear left, up one.

Bravo you hot?

Bravo, Stronghold,
head down the floor,

tell me when you're ready.

Bravo ready.

Alpha move.

Moving up.

Alpha set.

Bravo move.

Alpha, other side, move.

Get your butt up here.

Chris, where are you?

Chris?

Push forward.

Oh.

Oh please God, please.

Hello.

Daddy.

Clear.

Security check.

Tubby, check the body.

Clear.

One of our members
has returned to us.

And we are so grateful and
thankful to him for his service.

With thank him, we
thank his family.

He served our country
over two years

in Afghanistan and Iraq.

And we're so happy
to have him back.

Please stand Sergeant
Brandon Williams.

How you doing, sir.

Here you go, I'm so sorry.

Thank you.

Every third, Wednesday
of the month,

I gotta come up here to the VA

and talk to an expert
about my feelings.

All I really want is for
someone to listen to me.

That's not what happens.

Instead you go in there,
you pour your heart out.

And what they do is they
type on their computer,

print out some prescription
and they send you off.

They don't care.

They're not even listening.

This way, that way.

This way.

There you go.

Hey.

Can I get a round for the guys.

Sure thing.

Did Dallas win?

I don't know.

Look at it there.

I had him two to one.

New member?

I don't know.

I just thought, I
served in Afghanistan.

Oh I can tell.

Fourth Infantry Division.

Air Force retired.

You guys just finished
a parade or something?

You wanna join us?

I just kind of want
to be, you know?

Well.

Brandon, Brandon Williams.

Well, Brandon Williams,
stop by anytime.

Thank you.

Everybody get down.

Brandon, Brandon, it's okay.

Gary, get over here, Gary.

Tom, stop, what happened?

I been following him for miles,

he swerving all over the road.

Okay, I'm sorry, he's sorry,

he doesn't know what he's doing.

He's all messed up right now.

A warning, couldn't you
please just give me a chance

to talk to him?

He's going through so
much Tom, you know that.

I'll tell you what, if he's
serious about getting help,

have him give me a call.

Thank you.

Because he's gonna kill somebody

unless we get this
straightened out.

Hey, maybe after the game
we can go for a walk?

Yeah, a walk is good.

Amber, sweetie, did
you tell your daddy

about camp this summer?

Camp?

Yeah.

Church camp, she
finally reached the age.

Is it overnight?

Well yeah.

Absolutely not.

Dad.

Honey, you're way too young

to be going off to the
woods with whoever.

It's with the church.

I don't care who it's with.

Mom.

It's okay, honey, we'll
talk about it later.

We just talked about it.

The answer is no.

And what are you
doing with a phone?

What eight year old has a phone?

Gimme that.

That we won't survive

laying our weapons down

the truth and the lyin'

done and I need you

will come to my rescue.

What brings you to Texas?

You from around here?

No, my wife was
pregnant with my son

when I was in Afghanistan

and then decided she
wanted to be with her ex.

Took my son to Tahoe and my dog.

Took everything that I
had spent three tours

going up to the house with.

All my money in my
bank account gone.

I'm on my way back to Kentucky
to be close to my son.

But nothing.

Coal trucks, coal mines,
drugs and alcohol back there.

My buddy told me to stay at
his house down here Texas

and that didn't work out either.

Yeah, can you tell me
that your time overseas.

Did you ever feel like
you saw the explosion

and the tracer rounds coming?

Hey, I'm gonna stop you there.

I don't talk about
that stuff man.

Yeah, there was one time
that we were in this camp.

Look man, I asked you.

Just came in so
fast and it started.

All right.

I appreciate what
you're doing, man.

I really do, but I'm not into
the whole counseling bit.

Adam, wait.

Sorry for pushing you, man.

Listen, love to have
you over for a hot meal,

take a hot shower.

We can throw a ball game on
and just hang out, two Vets.

You gonna eat that burger?

Take it man, it's all yours.

Maybe.

Thank you.

Tubby, you got the rear?

Yeah, I got it.

Gamma, go pull security on rear.

Alpha, we got inventory.

Let's move.

We got a live one.

Take him, take him, take him.

Who are you?

Hey, good to see you.
Hey.

Yeah.

I am sorry to just
come by like this.

If you wanna do a different day.

No, it's fine, come on in.

You sure?

Absolutely, come on.

Honey, look who it is.

Oh, hi, hi, I'm Nancy,
nice to meet you.

Come on in.

Come on.

You know what, let me go
get Amber, she's outside.

That's a good idea.

Oh yeah, you can
meet my daughter.

Daughter.

You didn't tell me
you had a daughter.

How old is she?

I might send her.

She's eight going on 15.

Don't worry, you'll be fine.

Well, any case you have
a bathroom or something,

where I can freshen up?

Oh, I'm sorry, yeah,

it's right down there to
the right, help yourself.

Sure.

Hey.
Hey.

Where's Adam.

Oh he's in the bathroom,
he'll be right back.

Okay.

Honey.

Don't worry, he's a good guy.

I know.

I just wish you would have
told me he was coming.

Well, I didn't even
know he was coming.

I mean, I invited him, but.

Look, he's been through a lot

and he doesn't have anyone
to help him like I do.

Oh, oh Adam.

Please take a seat, I'm
gonna get dinner started.

Yeah, man, come one, gives
us more time to talk.

Hi, I'm Amber, nice to meet you.

Hi.

Where do you live?

Amber.

What?

No, it's all right.

Well I guess the easiest
way to explain that is,

outside.

It's kinda like
camping, every night,

I get to look at the
stars, look for planets,

lightening bugs,
crickets and birds

and listen to them all nice.

It's pretty cool.

I wish I could go camping.

Maybe your dad will
take you one day.

I was supposed to go to
church camp this summer

but dad says I can't go.

Hey, we said, we'll
talk about it.

We said, we'll talk about it?

You said no.
Well,

I'm still thinking about it.

Why your dad's just
trying to protect you.

Hey, my dad did the
same thing to me.

I was your age, we had this big
tree in the backyard, right,

and I wanted to climb it so bad,

dad didn't want me to
get hurt, told me not to.

I came home from school one day

and he was late
getting home from work.

You know what I did?

You climbed the tree.

All the way to the
top, all the way.

But I was too scared
once I got up there,

I couldn't get back down.

Then how'd you get down?

The easiest way
possible. I fell.

Hit most of the branches
on the way down too.

I didn't break any
bones or anything,

but my dad didn't
have any trouble

keeping me out of
the tree after that.

No, seriously thank you
guys for everything.

Absolutely, it was our pleasure.

Hey, the offer still stands,

you sure you don't
want to stay the night?

I'm good.

I got it, I'm okay, thank you.

Anytime.
Bye.

Have you been gonna
those meetings with Tom?

I missed the last one.

And the one before that.

Have you been going
to any at all?

Listen.
No, you listen Gary,

you can't keep doing this.

It's not good for the kids.

I'm trying to stay
away from them.

What?

No, that's not what they want.

Gary, they don't want you
to stay away from them.

We miss you.

We want you to be with us.

Fight for us,

like You fought for our country.

Is it too much to ask you to
come to the game next week?

It's the first of the playoffs.

Could you at least call
Tom about the meetings?

It might actually help.
Listen, I'll go.

I'll go to the game next week.

It wasn't like a charm or
anything to protect us.

It was just a reminder
that God was with us.

Whatever you gotta
do to get through it.

Oh, I'm sorry,

I know you didn't want
to talk about this stuff.

Can I ask you if
you believe in God?

You could ask, but
I couldn't say.

I mean, I've had moments

where everything's just falling
into place and I thank God.

Like most people
would say, I guess.

I've had other times where,

I swear it was like, God
was just out to kill me.

I guess what you call
God, I call luck.

It's not predictable,

it doesn't discriminate,

it doesn't care about anyone

or anything it
touches or breaks.

What's that picture
up there, man?

My squad, second
tour in Afghanistan.

See that guy third
from the right?

Yeah.

That was Mikey.

Amazing man.

He had a beautiful
wife, three kids.

One night, we were
out on a night patrol,

we were ambushed from all sides.

Somehow I found some cover.

Mikey didn't.

Everything in this world
is black and white.

Everything is
either good or evil.

Nobody realizes that they've
seen the things we've seen

and done the things
that we've done.

I was in the Shah Joy District

in the Zabul Province
of Afghanistan,

that night we went on patrol
and I stepped on an IED.

It coulda killed everybody.

I'm not a bomb maker, I
don't know what happened,

but it went off but
it didn't explode.

We were you're just
covered at HME powder.

And so many guys that have lost,

that had wives and kids
and dogs and families

and the rest of the rest
of their life to live

and I shoulda died
over there man.

Hey.

Maybe the fact that
the IED didn't explode

means God has a bigger
purpose for your life.

A second chance.

And I'm sure that us
meeting was no accident.

You sound like a preacher man.

Well, that's what they
called me in the army.

If you wanna hear
someone, who's way better,

you should come to
our church tomorrow.

Everyone there would
love to have you, man.

No pressure,

it's just an offer.

In recent weeks, we've
examined the themes of courage,

love and sacrifice, as
seen in the life of Jesus.

As I've said, in many ways,
Jesus was like a soldier.

This world was enemy
territory that he entered into

knowing what would
happen to him.

But he gave his life, not
only for those who loved him,

but for those who hated him,

including the very ones who
nailed him to the cross.

Think about that.

Paul writes in Romans 5,

"Very rarely will anyone
die for a righteous person

"though for a good person,

"someone might
possibly dare to die.

"But God demonstrates his
own love for us in this."

"While we were still
sinners, Christ died for us."

But the story doesn't
end there, does it?

On the third day
after his death,

Jesus rose again.

And what that means is that
we can be raised to new life,

forgiven our sins and
made right with God.

If we simply turn
to him in faith,

turn away from our
sins and trust in Jesus

instead of ourselves

and God will heal us no
matter how broken we are.

Hey, your right, in your right.

Clear.

Keep it together Tubby,
keep it together.

I'm good, I'm good.
Okay.

Hey sweetie, what are you doing?

I'm baking cookies
for the picnic.

I see that.

And that's a great thought,

but why don't you let
Mommy take over from here

and then you can
help me frost them.

I hope Adam's gonna love these.

I know he will have those.

Let me do this and.

You're getting it
all over Mommy.

Hey Pastor, how's it going?

Brandon, hi, it's.

I'm not sure how to tell
you this, it's about Adam.

Well, what about him?

He's dead.

I have a good friend
who's a police officer,

they found him late last night.

And it looks like he
took his own life.

I'm so sorry, Brandon.

Damen right, Damen Mudrick?

You served one tour to
Iraq, two to Afghanistan.

Yes, sir.

Oh, based on your last mission,

you were awarded
the Bronze Star.

Congratulations.

I think it's fair to
say that you've fallen

on some hard times haven't you?

It's fair to say.

Do you know this man?

He was handed over
to us by the Iraqis.

They say he's Al Qaeda.

He says that you
gave him something,

something very important.

Sergeant, what did you give him?

We lost a few guys outside
the city to these RPGs,

coming inside this warehouse,

they doused the
building with gunfire.

My team took the top floor.

We were only there

to make sure that there
were no survivors.

Tubby you got the rear?

Yeah, I got it.

Gamma, go pull security on rear.

Alpha, we got
inventory, let's move.

Captain, we got aa live one.

Take him, take him, take him.

He was in bad shape.

We figured it die so.

So what?

So we left him.

Sergeant, this man should
have been a prisoner.

Sergeant, what did you give him?

We gotta get outta here.

Hurry, hurry.

I gave him a bible.

An English bible.

Hey.

Hey, good morning, Pastor James.

Good morning, may I?

Absolutely.

A bus picks her up
down the corner.

Is Brandon here?

Yeah, yeah.

It's okay, if I speak
with him for a moment?

Come on in.

Thank you.

Brandon, there's no way
he could have known.

I have heard so many stories

of people who seemed
completely fine.

You just don't know.

There's nothing you
could have done.

But you knew you could
have done something?

God.

God was there.

Just watching when Adam
picked up that knife.

He was watching as he
slit each of his wrists

and he didn't do a
thing to stop it.

God was there when Adam
was in Afghanistan,

seeing people's
limbs get blown off,

children get shot,

but he didn't stop it.

No, all he did was stop
the bomb from going off

just to make sure Adam lived
a little bit longer to suffer

before he died anyway.

That's the God I preached
to dozens of soldiers

and said he loved them and
wanted the best for them.

Meeting you was the best thing

that could've ever
happened to Adam.

God used you to
help save his soul,

even if none of us could
help save his life.

So that's it.

That's all he promises.

Nothing for this life.

Ella we made it to the playoffs.

Emma was great.

I know, Angela didn't
even miss one goal.

What is the matter with you?

You coulda hurt me,
don't you pay attention

to what you're doing?

What is going on?

I'm sorry.

I was laying on the.

I was just, I was trying
to, I'm sorry listen.

Go to your room.

Go to your room.

Right now, go, go,
it's okay, go, go.

I'm sorry, I didn't know.

Gary, you need help.

Help, yeah okay.

I'm gonna go see Tom
in his bible friends

so that they can
quote cliches at me

and tell me what a
horrible person I am.

You're not a horrible person.

But you need help, but I can't
give it to you, I have tried.

Gary, you listen
to me right now.

I will not let you
hurt our children.

Even if it means I take
them away from you.

Get the medic, come on.

Chris, Chris, come on man.

Chris please look at me.

Look at me.

Come on, come on.
We can make it.

Gotta come on.

Hang in there, hang in there.

We can stay here, we can't
stay here, man, come on.

He believed you, you know,

we all did.

Damen, I'm so sorry.

Strangest thing though,

this mission, when
we first started out,

had to clearest feeling
that I was gonna die.

Can I see your bible, I
don't have mine anymore.

Read that.

Verse four.

"He will wipe away every
tear from your eyes.

"There will be no more death
or mourning or crying or pain"

"for the old order of
things has passed away."

Chris found that
one the other day.

He always liked to read
from the end of the book.

Do you want to
know what's better

than having every
tear wiped away?

Never having to cry
'em in the first place.

I just want to go.

I need to see my family again.

Tom, it's Gary.

What time did you say
that meeting was again?

Welcome everyone,
I'd like to thank you

for coming to today's meeting.

I know it's time away from
your family, but we are family,

we have a bond of brotherhood

and it's great that
you can come here

and share time with us.

It's a safe place to
talk about things,

if you feel like
talking about it

or listen to the
experiences of others.

Thanks again for being here.

So I did a two tours in Iraq

and when I come home,
life's never been the same.

I have anger issues and
these demons in my head,

it's hard to sleep at night

and I know I'm
hard to live with,

with all the issues
that I deal with.

My wife left me.

She couldn't deal
with it anymore.

I don't have a
relationship with my kids.

It's just me,

me and the demons.

His first assignment was in Iraq

and he said, "Honey,
you stay home"

"and plan the wedding while
I go and defend our country."

So off he went

and I went home and started
planning the wedding.

But Daniel never came home.

And there was no wedding.

He called us one day and he said

that they were shipping
him out to Afghanistan

and he promised
me, he'd be back.

I'm gonna tell you I prayed
every single day for him.

As a mom, I was never so scared.

I remember the day
sitting in that chair,

right in front of that
flag-draped casket.

And I said, there is no way
that my son is in that casket.

They didn't even have
much to identify.

I know the government
made a huge mistake

and my son is gonna come home
to me, just like you promised.

You said 12:30.
Around 12:30.

12:30 again.

So you off next week.

You guys just open a Walmart?

We're the Honor Guard.

We conduct military service
for a fallen brothers.

And this is Doug,

we just slewed his casket today.

Doug was the comrade
here at the VFW Post 573.

I've known him ever
since I was a kid.

We do about a hundred
funerals a year.

A hundred?

I'm so sorry guys,
I didn't know.

That's what we do,
we continue to serve.

And we're always
looking for new members.

Hi, my name's Thomas.

I'm not really here for myself,

I'm here for my
father, these were his.

Every 4th of July, we would all

watch the fireworks together
as family, you know.

And after he came back,

he didn't want to watch
'em with us anymore.

You said they
scared him too much.

The other night my
father took his own life.

Now I gotta explain
to my little brother

why his daddy's not
gonna be around anymore.

How do you explain
to a 12 year old kid

that his dad's not
gonna be around anymore?

I appreciate everyone sharing.

Thank you for being here,
it means a lot to everyone.

Before we close, does anybody
else have anything to add?

Yeah, I got something.

My name is Gary
Newhouse, sergeant, Army.

My friends are well,
my fellow soldiers,

they call me Tubby.

I joined the military
because I needed change,

I needed a direction.

And I did get change.

You know, my unit,
we had this idea

that if we carried Bibles
with us everywhere we went,

we would be safe,
we'd be protected.

But obviously that didn't
do us too much good.

We were stationed up on a
fob in the Kunar Valley,

small ambushes day and night.

And I'd find myself asking,

where's God in all of this?

But I know now, I know
that God is with me,

he's the only reason I'm here.

Are you sure you
want to do this?

Yes sir, I am.

This is very serious.

You want to see it from a
different perspective, son?

You hand a flag to a
wife or a daughter,

you watch their hearts break
at the playing of, "Taps."

I know how hard it is.

But you have another chance.

Just don't let
your mind go dark.

'Cause when you do,

it's over.

Well, there they are.

You want me to go with you?

No, I got to do this
myself, thanks though.

Shine your light on me

know you don't need me.

Hello.

Preacher.

Damen, what's going on man.

I tried calling
since we got back,

but the number you
gave me doesn't work.

Yeah, yeah.

Hey listen, do you
remember that mission

at the warehouse
right before Chris?

Anyway, that wounded guy,

you remember I
gave him my bible?

Yeah.

You're not gonna believe this.

I can barely believe it,
I can barely believe it,

but he's still alive.

If it wasn't for you, none
of this would have happened.

What, what wouldn't
have happened?

He took that one bible,

and over the last two years,

he's been planting
churches all over Iraq.

He wasn't even a terrorist,

they were holding
him against his will.

And he's been.

What are the odds of that?

I don't know about you,

but I left Iraq thinking
that God was nowhere in it.

But because of what you did,

hundreds of people ain't
saved over there right now.

And that's not all,

Yasin, that's his
name, Pastor Yasin.

And I got to meet him.

The government granted
him asylum here.

He tried to thank me
for saving his life.

But I told him that you were
the one that gave me a bible.

He'd like to meet
you if that's cool.

Well great, I'd like
to meet him too,

and see you again.

Where are you guys?

After we last met in Jalalabad,

they put me in the military.

I refused to join

and they called me terrorist,

sympathizer to American.

They put me back in the prison.

After that, they traded
me to your government.

I have this for years now.

I have read it many, many times.

And this is what I
come to know about it.

God always will finish
the work he has started.

I think it's awesome,

he's gonna get
housing assistance.

I just wish more homeless
veterans would get that.

Yeah, I tried for it but.

Look, when I got back home,

I didn't even wanna
stay at my old place,

Chris and I shared it.

Everything just reminded
me of him, you know.

So where do you live now?

Well, I mean, I got some money.

The government wasn't
totally without sympathy.

I'll be all right.

I'll get back on my feet.

Of wrong in my life

in our bed tonight

took one to figure out

it's just you and me

eye and I can't seem to see

so blind it almost sees.

I know they're just fine

and our dreams tonight

me and see everything

when daddy is home now
