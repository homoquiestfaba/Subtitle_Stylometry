<i>[ Man Narrating ] White Mike and his father
moved after his mother died of breast cancer.</i>

<i>It ate her up- and most of their money.</i>

<i>They can't control the old radiators,
and it's very hot in springtime.</i>

<i>In White Mike's room,
old unpacked boxes stick out of the closet...</i>

<i>so he can see them.</i>

<i>Maybe you know how it is. Maybe you don't.</i>

<i>But sometimes, if you can't see
what you're finished with, it's better.</i>

<i>White Mike stripped to his shorts
and lay down on the floor...</i>

<i>so he felt a little cooler.</i>

<i>That's how it was
the first night in his new room.</i>

<i>And that's how it still is.</i>

<i>White Mike is thin and pale, like smoke.</i>

<i>White Mike has never
smoked a cigarette in his life.</i>

<i>Never had a drink.
Never sucked down a doobie.</i>

<i>He once went three days without sleep
as a kind of experiment.</i>

<i>That's as close as he's ever gotten
to fucked up.</i>

<i>White Mike has become
a very good drug dealer.</i>

So, to my mom.

To your mom.

<i>All she could think was,
"That bitch, Miss Lemky, gave me a 'B. "'</i>

Miss Lemky has had it out for me ever since she
overheard me telling Vanessa she's a lesbian.

Seriously, you hire your girlfriend
as your assistant? How obvious is that?

No! This isn't just one "B."
This is huge. This can affect everything-

getting into Wesleyan, Which law school
I attend, the firm I become partner at...

maybe even Who I marry-
assuming I don't marry Johnny Depp.

They should send Miss Lemky back to Reade

[ Class Chuckling ]

<i>Well, Lincoln became a martyr...</i>

was created a symbol of freedom and peace.

Something this country can look up to.

But the truth is, death doesn't vindicate.

It doesn't vindicate.

It may have been good for the country,

and it definitely wasn't good
for John F. Kennedy.

What are you saying? Did they die in vain?

"Four score and seven"-

probably say "no. "

here tomorrow night.

Just had a party last night.

No. I mean... famous party.

<i>Page Six, W.</i>

The kind of party people lie
and say they were at.

I could get everybody cool to come.

Sit down.

Wouldn't want it to be too big.

Don't you want to have
a famous party for my birthday?

Yeah. Sure, but-
Biggest party ever.

It'll be amazing.

Wait till you see my dress.

Not too many people though.

But it has to be huge.

Besides...

people will need
to keep themselves entertained...

in case we start to have extra fun by ourselves.

Somewhere else.

Thought you had a boyfriend.

I have lots of boyfriends.
I mean, I'm not a slut.

Of course you're not.

But different guys are interesting
for different reasons.

You're interesting for a very specific reason.

What's that?

You'll have to figure that out for yourself.

I just don't want too many people.

You want me, don't you?

Just... leave the people up to me. Okay?

Now, how about some cash for your part?

Yeah. Come upstairs.
I'll grab the money. How much?

Two grand. And I'll stay here.

Okay.

You want a beer or something?
I'm good. Thanks.

Are we inviting everyone?

Well, not everyone.

Everyone.

Well, I mean, everyone cool.

<i>- Hey, Molly.
Michael. Hey, what are you doing?</i>

Not much. Just running a few errands
for my dad actually. How about you?

<i>I'm just writing a report
on The Plague by Camus.</i>

Have to finish before break's over.
Can you believe it?

<i>Oh, my God. Yeah, I totally know The Plague.
How do you like it?</i>

Rats dying, people dying.

It's just so much death and... dying.

I'm- I'm so sorry.

No, no. Don't worry about it.

<i>- [ Sighs ]
You know, Michael.</i>

<i>I'm here for you if you ever want to talk,

Hey, listen. My dad's calling me
on the other line, so I'm just gonna go.

I'll talk to you When I see you. Okay?

Yeah, yeah. Are we still on for tomorrow?

<i>Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna see you tomorrow. That's right.</i>

All right. See you then.

<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

Bye.

<i>[ Narrator ]
Molly didn't see White Mike cry at the funeral.</i>

<i>Never saw him cry about it.</i>

<i>She saw his cousin Charlie cry about it-
and White Mike's father.</i>

<i>But not White Mike.</i>

<i>Everyone said he looked handsome
at the funeral.</i>

<i>He didn't care.</i>

<i>There was a wig on his mother's corpse,
which made him angry.</i>

<i>Wigs weren't real...</i>

<i>and he wanted real.</i>

<i>He would have rather
had seen her for the last time...</i>

<i>with her head bald.</i>

<i>I can see you. Can you see me?</i>

[ Chris ]
No, Mom. Adjust your camera.

How's Saint Martin's?

<i>Besides your father's sunburn
and the mosquitoes...</i>

<i>and those boring Jarvises down again...</i>

<i>things are going as planned.</i>

<i>- Everything okay, sweetie?
Yeah.</i>

Carmelita's nephew came in from the
Dominican, so I gave her a few days off.

<i>Thank you, darling.
You are really taking control.</i>

<i>Very adult.</i>

<i>Are you having any fun before you-</i>

I'm having a few people over tomorrow night.
Nothing too big.

<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

Actually, I gotta go.
Mark and Timmy just showed up. Guys.

Hey! Mommy dearest! How are you?

<i>Claude, you know
you are not welcome in that house.</i>

Well, rehab was great. Thanks for asking.

You look tired, Mom. You still taking
your Ambien, Xanax, Sonata, Lunesta?

Did I miss any?

<i>- I want you to leave immediately.
But I'm just settling in!</i>

<i>If you don't leave immediately,
I'm gonna get your father.</i>

I love you too, Mom.

<i>- Chris, I'm disappointed in you.
[ Pill Bottle Rattling ]</i>

<i>I think I should call the police.</i>

Mom, you have to talk to him.
Just ask him about rehab or something.

He's leaving in a few days for the Gunnery.
Just chill out, Mom.

<i>All right. Go get him.</i>

[ Mutters ]

[ Knocking ]

[ Chris ]
Mom wants to talk to you.

Claude.

Just give him the beer, okay, Al-Qaeda?
Please. Thanks.

Leave, or I call cops.

well, how about I call my foot up your ass?

Shit! He just busted out a nine-mil.
He was gonna pop a cap in your ass.

<i>[ High-pitched Voice ] So, there's a whole
lot of shit that goes down at school, huh?</i>

<i>[ Low Voice ]
Sure is.</i>

<i>Yeah, they all have bad taste in music,
and they're all assholes.</i>

<i>[ Male Voice ]
What about her friends?</i>

<i>[ Squeaky Female Voice ]
Especially her friends.</i>

<i>[ Male Voice ] Who would you kill first
if you had to kill someone there?</i>

<i>- I'd kill 'em all.
I would have to kill that Jessica bitch first.</i>

I'd take the nine-milli, and I'd be like
"pop, pop" right to the back of her head.

<i>And then I'd be dead.</i>

And I would never have to
be an honor student at Wesleyan.

<i>Everyone would cry and say
what a lovely, lovely girl she was.</i>

And the school would have
a moment of silence.

<i>And then Matt Lauer would have your mom on.</i>

<i>Diane Sawyer
would have Sarq, Gabby and Shelly-</i>

<i>Katie Couric would do an in-depth report
on high school violence.</i>

<i>[ Female Voice ]
And the most moving voice of all, Ann Curry...</i>

<i>would look directly into the camera and say...</i>

<i>"Our thoughts and prayers are with her family. "</i>

<i>[ Crowd Laughing ]</i>

<i>[ Laughing, Chattering ]</i>

Oh, no.

<i>Uh-oh.</i>

<i>- Did it all.

Oh, fuck.

<i>- Oh, no.

Oh, fuck.

[ Pounding On Door ]

[ Bell Dings ]
I'm looking for something special.

Cash only.

[ Chattering ]

Can I go now?
You know a kid named Arturo Berrara?

Uh, Arturo from the rec?

Arturo can place you at the projects
a few minutes after the shots were fired.

[ Laughs ]
Shots? No, he's lying.

I- I want an attorney.

I need to contact my father by satellite phone.

Forensics has a match. The blood on your
shoes and the blood at the murder scene.

Murder scene? What?

You murdered Nana.

And now you want to tell me
the name of the White kid you killed?

His I.D. says he's Maurice Charles
from Columbus, Ohio.

But, Hunter...

there is no Maurice Charles
from Columbus, Ohio.

[ Cell Phone Ringing ]

Yo, Warren. What's going on, man?
You back in the city?

Yeah, Well, listen, I have a-
I've got about a quarter left.

<i>- You want it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

<i>I'll take it. Meet me up on 88th.</i>

88th? All right. Cool. All right. Bye.

Oh, shit.

[ Beeping ]
Fuck!

<i>[ Jessicq's Voice ] I was just thinking that
maybe instead of us going to Bergdorf's...</i>

<i>you could just give me money
and I could go myself.</i>

Absolutely not.

You've already spent all of your vacation money.

Oh, my God. Mom!

I'm buying you a new dress
for Sara's party tonight, and that is it.

I don't want a new dress.

You have no idea how lucky you are.

Are you aware that the Mortimers
have lost 40% of their net worth?

Forty.
Yes. And they are still stinking rich.

Better not let your father
hear you talk that way.

Better not let my father meet Donnie.

I just got your report card.

Mom, I got one fucking "B."
Can we not make a media circus about it?

Okay. I was just wondering
if anything was bothering you.

No!

No.

Well, if there is, it might be time
for you to go talk to someone.

[ Chuckling ]
You want me to go to a shrink.

Yeah, a shrink. I go to one.

Three-quarters of your idiot friends go to one.

And the other quarter should go to one.

I try to fuck with my shrink.

I try to fuck my shrink.

Mine knows nothing about sex or guys.

My shrink is so stupid.

It might help to get that grade up.

This Whole Wesleyan idea-
that's between you and your father.

It has nothing to do with me,
and a "B" isn't cutting it.

Whatever, Mommy! I don't need a shrink.
I don't know What I would talk about.

You'd talk about school, boys, me.
I'm sure you'd find something.

Fine! I will go. Can I just have some money?

Absolutely not.

And I put a great little Marc Jacobs
on hold for you at Bergdorf's.

Rosa, we're leaving.

God!

I can meet you around, like, 4:00?
Is that too late?

No, not at all.

Listen, let's meet
at that coffee shop you like on Lex.

Across from that pizza place. Remember?

Yeah, yeah. That sounds good.

All right. Listen, I'll see you
When I get there. Okay?

<i>I'll see you at 4.00.</i>

<i>- Bye.
Bye.</i>

What's up, warren? I thought you were in Cancun.
How you doin'?

I gotta meet the family.
We're skiing in Sun Valley.

I leave tonight. It's boring.

I'm almost looking forward to going back to school.
Yeah, right.

No, really, man.
Harvard's better than you think.

You should come.
Nah.

You got no discipline, Mike.

Discipline?
Warren, my Whole life disciplined me.

Yeah. And so real.

Excuse me?

What, you come back here thinking
you're learning something important?

I spent the night in a fucking
construction hole there, Warren...

to save my last bag
to bring to you on 88th Street.

My dad's a waiter. All right?

To pay off his debts from my mom's cancer
and his bankrupt restaurant.

And you think you're real?
Don't be so melodramatic.

Look at yourself. Fuck off.

Hey, do you know Where Hunter is?

[ Phone Beeping ]

<i>Hey, it's Hunter. Leave a message.</i>

Yeah, Hunter. Where are you?

If you and Charlie are fucking with me,
I swear to God.

By the way, Warren's a douche.

Hunter.

You may not remember me.
Avery Kimball, your father's attorney.

I brought you some fresh clothing.

And I have your father on the line.

We'll have you out of here in an hour.

Dad, I didn't kill anyone.

<i>Don't say anything, Hunter.
You're in Avery's hands now.</i>

<i>He tracked us down.</i>

<i>We left you our itinerary. You know that.</i>

Yeah, I know.

<i>Why didn't you call me?</i>

<i>All right. I'm on the first plane there.
That's the best I can do.</i>

<i>JesusI Who could have
expected anything like this?</i>

Yeah. I know.

<i>[ Narrator ]
Hunter thought...</i>

<i>"He's the dad. Let him figure it out.</i>

<i>Let him decide what to say next. "</i>

<i>How are you feeling?</i>

Pretty shitty, Dad.

<i>[ Narrator ]
Just say it once, please.</i>

<i>I love you, Son.</i>

[ Sniffles ]

[ Inhales, Sighs ]

<i>[ Lionel ]
You need to be moving Twelve, man.</i>

I got orders off the rack coming out your hood.

Yeah?
I'm telling you, Mike.

This is What you need to fuck with, right here.

Twelve, man.

You know that girl you sold to yesterday?
What girl, man?

She's been hitting me up hard.

She wants your number.

She wants to place a tall order
for some birthday party.

But, Lionel, look.

I can't be getting involved
with this Twelve shit, man.

All right?

Is it cool if I give her your number?

White Mike's just popping, man.
You're full of questions, man.

You want some trees or not?

[ Clears Throat ]

Give her my number, man.

All right. Cool. Thanks.

[ Door Closes ]

[ Exhales ]

<i>[ Sara ]
It's gonna be a famous party.</i>

And I'll be famous.

That's What you want- to be famous?

Well, if you're famous in your school,
you're famous in all schools...

and then in the city-
or at least the part that matters.

Then you have a career.

So...

Sean's your boyfriend?

I have lots of boyfriends.
I mean, I'm not a slut.

Different guys are interesting
for different reasons.

You're interesting for-

I'm sorry.

That's a line.

I've used it before, a lot.

I think if I met myself, I'd hate me.

Why do you say that?

Because...

I'm a shallow, narcissistic bitch...

Who manipulates everyone for everything...

and freaks out royally
When I don't get What I want.

I mean, you wouldn't even like me
if I wasn't hot, right?

Who says I like you?
[ Chuckles ]

You're sweet.

Do you have any weed?
Yeah. Sure.

Bring it tonight, okay?
Everyone's bringing something.

That blonde bitch is using you.
Shut up.

Not that you'll listen to me...

not that you actually have a chance
of popping your fucking cherry.

Shut up. I'm not a virgin.

Oh, yeah? Who?
Zibby Schwartz, Southampton.

You wish.

How would you know? You weren't even there.

Where the hell did you get that?

The only tits you ever sucked on are Mom's.

You're Mama's boy.
Shut the fuck up.

I- I'm sorry. What? What did you say?

I couldn't hear you.

Chill out.

Listen!
[ Chuckles ]

You've always been her favorite.

That's Why you're going to Saint Martin's
tomorrow, and I'm not.

I found your ticket in your room.

What?

You on roids again?

Say it. "I'm a- I'm a fucking mama's boy. "

No.

Here you go.

<i>[ Narrator ]
Andrew thought, "Damn. This is a drug deal. "</i>

Is this your first time?

And the last, hopefully.

[ Scoffs ]

Since you're not planning on becoming
a regular customer, Why the weed?

This girl I know wanted it,
so I'm sort of picking it up for her.

It's her birthday.

She shouldn't smoke it
if she's not brave enough to buy it.

Yeah, I guess. You know girls.

Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]

Do you have a girlfriend?

Not really, no. She's, um-

Well, she's too good for the life I lead,
you know?

Well, listen, um-

Good luck with the girl and everything.

Yeah. Thanks for the weed.
Hey, anytime.

Good luck to you too, man,
you know, with dealing or Whatever.

I hope it works out for you.

Yeah. Thanks.

<i>[ Narrator ]
As Andrew walked away, he thought...</i>

<i>"That must be the wackest drug dealer ever. "</i>

a couple ounces for the bounces, quick?

<i>Okay, listen, I have a 4.00
at 71 st and Lexington.</i>

If you can be there in five minutes.

Oh, dude, I'm so there. Fuckin' Medicine Man.

I said fi- I said five minutes.

<i>- I'm across the street, dude.
Okay, Well, I'm here. Bye.</i>

[ Horns Honking ]

Yo, Medicine Man.
Hey.

I'm sorry. I ran into this babe.
Don't worry about it.

So What's up? How are you?
Here. Good.

Are you listening to me?
Yeah.

There's undercovers in the area.

We gotta get the fuck out of here
as fast as we can.

I will catch you at Sara's party tonight.
Will do.

See you later?
Okay.

All right.
Bye.

Hey!

Hey! What's going on?

How are you?
I'm good. How you been?

I've been really, really good.

It's been a long time, Michael.

Yeah, I know. I've just been-

A lot of late nights, you know?
It's good though.

You look tired.
Has your dad been working you hard?

I've just been working till 3:00 in the morning
every night hosting for my dad.

But other than that, yeah, it's a good gig.
[ Chuckles ]

Good.
The restaurant host. How you doing?

I'm good.

I think I need to induct someone
into the Hypocrites' Club.

Uh-oh. Who's that?

Me.

It's not that easy to make the cut, Molly.

You know that.
Oh, I don't know about that.

I just let some pretty boy
try and put the moves on me.

Oh, so What?

So What about the fact that guys like him
stand for everything we despise...

and I totally let him flatter me?

I did. And get this-
Hmm. Hmm.

Not only is he a model,
he made sure to give me his card.

But he told me exactly What pages
of What magazines all of his pictures are on.

And he had blue toenail polish.
Oh, that's painful.

Cool. Thanks.
Thank you.

I ordered us hot chocolates.
Thank you.

So, What do you think?
Do I make it into this dreaded club or What?

Well, let's see.

He's obviously pretty good-looking,
and girls are attracted to beauty.

But no, you're repelled by superficiality...

so it's complexity, not hypocrisy.

You don't get in.

Why are you the only one that gets me?

And Why can I never figure you out, Michael?

[ Exhales ]
I don't know.

Uh- Well, Blue Toes
invited me to a party tonight.

What party?

Sara something
and I guess a guy named Chris.

I don't know them.
Yeah? Let me see.

Well, um, are you gonna go?

I was, uh- I was thinking maybe
I could come by the restaurant tonight.

I haven't been by in forever, and it'd be nice
to do something When you get off.

It just gets really busy on Saturday nights.

Or you could. I mean-

It's just busy.

Yeah, yeah.
I mean, maybe some other time.

Yeah, I understand.

So-

[ Clears Throat ]

Well, um, I guess I'm gonna
go to this party then.

You are?
Yeah.

Yeah? Okay.

Um-

Okay. Well, uh-

Listen, I gotta go.
My dad's, um- he's waiting on me.

And, um-
All right.

I gotta get to work, so-
Okay.

But listen, it was really nice to see you.
Um, here.

No, I got it. I already paid.
What?

Don't worry about it.

Thanks.

All right.

Well, have fun at the party...

With Tobias the tool bag.

[ Laughing ] Is that a hint of jealousy
I'm hearing in your voice, Michael?

No, it's not jealousy.
No?

Come on. We're friends, right?

Yeah.

Bye.

Take care of yourself, okay?
You too.

No.

You need to go back in that house

I can give you something else.

As Sara lay dying, she thought...</i>

<i>"This will be famous...</i>

<i>and make an unbelievable story
when school starts again.</i>

<i>People will be sorry they weren't here. "</i>

[ Footsteps ]

Molly, I'm so sorry...

I lied to you.

I just-

You know, I didn't want you to know
I was the president...

of the Hypocrites' Club.

Why do you do it?

I mean, how- how can you do it?

I mean, there's-

There's no reason.

I think there is.

You don't- You don't drink.

You don't do drugs.

Because you like the power you have...

being sober...

around people Who are always fucked up.

But you know What?

That makes you
so much more fucked up than them.

Because Who gave you this right...

to just go around and experiment
With other people's lives?

[ Sniffles ]

No, you're right.

You're right. I'm sorry. I just-

Molly, When I get out of here,
I'm gonna call you.

No, Michael, no.

Please, don't.

Do not call me or anything
until you stop dealing.

Okay?

I'm sorry.

[ Groans ]

<i>[ Narrator ] Molly always
reminded White Mike of his mother.</i>

Hi.

I'm sorry.

Don't say that, Mom.

Okay?

Okay.

[ Sighs ]

We won't talk about it anymore.

We'll just live the best life we can.

Did you hear me, Michael?

Always live the best life you can.

<i>[ Narrator ]
You will not be remembered if you die now.</i>

<i>You will be buried and mourned by a few.</i>

<i>And what more can you ask for?</i>

<i>The world will spiral from underneath you...</i>

<i>and you're either too smart
or too dumb to find God.</i>

<i>Maybe you are angry...</i>

<i>only because the way out is through love...</i>

<i>and you are just horny and lonely.</i>

<i>You have seen that before you
lies a great stretch of road...</i>

<i>and it is windswept...</i>

<i>or blasted by the hot sun...</i>

<i>or covered in snow...</i>

<i>or it is dirt...</i>

<i>or concrete...</i>

<i>or shrouded in darkness...</i>

<i>or bright and clear so you have to squint.</i>

<i>But no matter what...</i>

<i>it feels utterly empty.</i>

<i>But there are sons who have lost mothers...</i>

<i>and mothers who have lost sons.</i>

<i>So...</i>

<i>we must live the best life we can.</i>

<i># I've had my frustrations #</i>
