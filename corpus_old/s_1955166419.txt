I don't think you realize
what a godsend you are.

Not many people jump at the
opportunity to stay here alone.

Why?

Oh, old ghost stories.

This is the oldest house
in the city, you know.

Lots of history.

A few unpleasant nicknames.

We've tried to rebuild
the reputation in the

neighborhood, but then last
winter the caretaker, well...

Yes?

Well, I really shouldn't
be telling you this.

Please.

Well, poor girl, she, she
threw herself off the

upstairs balcony.

Why did she do that?

Hard to say, really.

But you needn't
worry about that.

This really is a
lovely old house.

It will take care of you,
and I'm certain there

won't be a single problem.

Of course not, ma'am.

Good.

Will a check be alright?

Yes.

Splendid.

Oh, I mustn't keep them waiting.

I left our telephone
number by the phone.

Feel free to call any time about
anything, even to say hello.

I will.

You're a doll.

Toodle-oo.

Darling.

Poor girl.

She threw herself off the
upstairs balcony.

Yes?

Hello?

Darling, is that you?

I wanted to check in and
make sure the first night

went smoothly.

I forgot to mention to you,
please, have your references

reach out to us.

Who?

Andrew Dopling or something.

Abbott?

Yes, that's it.

They were odd.

Uh, I'll try them for you.

I still haven't received my
final payment from them anyway.

Just give them the
number I left for you.

Uh, ma'am, there's one
room that I can't get into.

Yes?

Um, the room at the
end of the hall.

Don't concern yourself
with that room, dear.

Is that understood?

It must remain
locked at all times.

Am I clear?

Yes ma'am.

Thank you again.

Goodbye, dear!
Ma'am?

Miss?

Miss?

Oh, god!

Uh, Jesus,
I'm sorry. Sorry.

I just, you dropped this.

Here.

Sorry for frightening you.

Okay.

Alright then. Bye.

Hell...

Hello?

Hello? Hello?
Hello, are you there?

Hi.

Can I...?

Is anybody sitting here?

No.

Do you mind if I sit?

Eh...

Now I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

Uh, I just hope your
boyfriend doesn't come and

hit me in the back of the head.

Don't worry.

Have you...
Been here before?

Why?

You know, I don't know.

Um, maybe I'm mistaken.

What do you mean?

Heh, I just, i-i guess
you look familiar.

I just have one of those faces.

Yeah.

Yeah, I guess so.

Hey, can I get you something?

Like what?

Uh, a drink.

Let me get, um, two gins.

Do you like gin?

Sure.

Very nice.

Thank you.

You're sure you're not
waiting for anybody?

I was waiting for you.

Heh, that's, that's funny.

It's true.

It's also very flattering.

Uh, heh.

I am gonna get another round.

You too?

Let me get, uh, two more.

Why not?

So uh, what do you
do for, uh, work?

Hm?

For work, your job?

Nothing, really.

Would you excuse
me for a moment?

W-where're you going?

I'll be right back.

Huh?

Don't go anywhere.

Okay.

You alright?

Yes.

Don't I look alright?

Oh yeah, you look great.

Thank you.

I, I'm just, uh, waiting
for another drink.

I don't know where
the bartender is.

Do you want to come
back to my place?

What?

It's not far.

There's plenty of Brandy.

It's free.

Yeah.

Yeah, uh, let me just cash out.

Alright.

Let's go.

Uh, are you joking?

Are you coming?

This is your place?

You can sit here.

Oh my god!

You know, I gotta tell
you, I never pictured you

living in a place like this.

Why not?

Well, because...

I'm sorry.

Well, they have got to
tell you this kind of

thing before you move in, right?

That it's haunted?

Okay.

So they must've gave you
a big discount, or...

Which is obviously none
of my business, but...

No. Please.

I mean, it's just stories I
heard when I was growing up.

But basically, they used
to tell us about this, uh,

old lunatic.

Used to live here, perform
these rituals in one of

trying to conjure up the living
devil or something like that.

It was kids' stories,
mostly, but...

You grew up here?

Yeah, I grew up just a few
blocks south of here,

so don't hold that against me.

Hey, uh, you know what, I
gotta be honest with you.

This isn't something I ever
really do with anybody.

The thing is, i-i just got
this big promotion, so..

Do what?

W-whatever it is
we're doing.

We're having a drink.

Oh yeah, yeah.

Of course.

It's just...

It's funny, I uh...

Phew.

It's just not every day
I uh, go out and meet

somebody like you,
who's so open.

This whole city is...

Always on the defensive,
and it's just...

It's refreshing to meet
somebody who doesn't

immediately think
you're a maniac.

You're one of the good guys.

I try to be.

You're not lying to me?

Hey.

Tell you what, does it
look like I'm lying?

Just one of those faces, Henry.

Mm, what?

No, i-I'm telling
you the truth.

I am honestly one
of the good ones.

Look, I waiting for my
friends at the bar.

Ask them!

I would never in a million
years just go home with

someone I just met, who
invited me to their house.

If I told them that,
and for whiskey?

They would laugh in my face!

I tell you what would be
really funny, we should

give them a ring later on
and tell them, tell them

that it's entirely
possible to have a cordial

meeting with someone when you
just met them at a bar 'cause...

Oogh!

Agh!

Oh god, ah...

Why did you come here tonight?

What did you expect?

You didn't even ask me my name.

Did you want to fuck me?

Agh!

Ahh!

Remember me?

Do you remember me?

Because I remember you,
Henry Sullivan.

I remember every single
thing about that night.

Why did you do it?

Why did you pick me?

What did I ever do to you?

Why did you pick me?

Answer me!

Fuck you!

Agh!

Help me.

Help me.

Help me.

Help me.

Help me.

Hello?

Darling, I want you to
listen to me very carefully.

Ma'am?

We finally got a hold
of your references.

You did?

Yes.

Dr. Abbott.

Dr. Abbott?

You never cared for
his family, did you?

We know what you did, dear.

Darling?

I couldn't let him live
with what he did to me.

But Dr. Abbott...

He says I'm okay.

He says I'm okay now.

We're not mad, dear.

We would just like you...

We would just like you to leave.

Take your things and leave.

We would just like you to leave.

I saw him walking around.

Henry Sullivan.

I saw him walking around
the street the other day.

Right in front of me.

I couldn't let him live
with what he'd done to me.

Darling?

What do you mean you "saw him
walking around the other day?"

Ma'am?

Did you do something
to somebody?

Did you do something
to somebody?

Can you hear me?

Can you hear me?

Ma'am?

Please just listen to me.

You can keep the money.

Please, just go home.

Is it true what they
say about this place?

What? Who?

That someone tried to conjure
the devil here once.

It happened in that room,
didn't it?

The one upstairs.

They made me do it.

Ma'am?

I think I'll become one
of your ghost stories now.

What?

Hello?

Hello?

What did you make me do to him?

We can't cuff the guy unless...

She said there was a murder?

I-I-I don't know.
That's...

Now we got four
guys trying to...

Hey, listen, shut the
fuck up! Alright?

Do you have the keys?
I'm sorry. Jesus!

Lighten up, will you?

It's a good story.

Come on...

Hello?

This is the one you
were here for...

You can be free.

You don't know how much of
a godsend you are, really.

Oh, well it was
fortunate for me, too.

Somebody at such late notice,
especially with our reputation.

Reputation?

With the previous caretakers.

Well, I really shouldn't
be telling you this.
