911.

Yes!

It's...
It took my little brother.

What happened?

It took my little brother!

I-I can't understand
what you're saying.

What's wrong?

What's wrong?

My little brother.

They took your little brother?

Son, let me talk
to somebody else.

I can't understand
what you're saying.

[Speaks indistinctly]

How old is your brother?

5.

5 years old?
Yes.

Somebody kidnapped
your 5-year-old brother?

Yes!

Please help him.

With no sign of the little boy,

There are some new worries
tonight.

Will he be able to survive
a full night alone out there?

When was the last time
you saw Dean?

Um... They were just playing.

He just vanished.

He's just gone.

Every 40 seconds, a child goes
missing in this country.

One of our kids
has gone missing,

And nobody's doing anything.

Many people out there may have,
you know,

Considered these children
as probably dead.

Dean Tanner ain't no different
than anyone we've already lost.

27 years, we've been asking,

"Who could take
a 6-year-old boy?"

Human beings
are violent animals.

Yeah, they just are.

They really hurt each other.

They remember finding threads
of his clothes here and there

And half of his shoe,
part of his pants.

It was kind of strange.

I don't know
what happened there.

Yeah, this is a very...
A very violent fucking place.

We know that time is the enemy,

And we know that you have to
move quickly.

But just because a child hasn't
been recovered in a week

Or a month or a year or 15 years

Does not mean
that it's acceptable

To assume the worst
and stop looking.

Well, the cops we got
in this town

Aren't worth a shit anyway.

I'm here to tell you.

They're not gonna do anything!

We're not trying
to put on a show.

We're just trying to help people
find people.

Well, then take your camera

And go into the fucking woods
and fucking find him.

You're looking for answers
to why there's people missing.

We already know about that.

We're handling it.

We don't need you flatlanders
to come in here

And start snooping around,
turning over stones.

You're opening up
a pandora's box

Of hellacious shit
that you don't want to see.


[Breathing heavily]

Mike? Mike?

Breathe, breathe, breathe.

I'm right here.

I'm right here.

It's over. Breathe.

[Breathing deeply]

It's over.

It's okay.
This is why we're doing this.

Oh, my God.

Guys, what is that?

Wow!

What is that?

What's going on?

No, I'm being really s...
What is that thing?

What?
That's not what we're taking?

[Exhales deeply]

That is, uh,
that's something else.

Josh, what is this?
What?

It's Bernadette.

Hey.
Hey now.

Seriously, what is this thing?

It's a recreational vehicle.

Does this even drive?

It moves.

Oh. Oh!

Wow.

What is that smell?

Pretty sure
it's called asbestos.

Oh, my God.

Josh, this thing's nicer
than your apartment, man.

Come on.
Are you kidding me right now?

Immediately I think
of a registered sex offender.

It's a little awkward.

Listen, things work.

Oh, I don't even think
it's registered.


Do I need a flu shot
to get on this thing?

Yeah, you do.
Look, I got beds in the back...

Actually, I got one mattress
in the back for you,

So you have to deal with that.

And then Teddy and I
will sit up front.

We'll be fine.

Teddy can do that.
I'll do across the chair here.

We got some cameras.

What?

Yeah, dad's... this is dad's
hunting vehicle, as well.

What?

That... those work?

This thing's a piece of shit.
I could get behind this.

Literally, 'cause we're gonna
have to push it, probably.

Oh, my God.

[Engine turns over]

Josh?
What?

This, uh, this isn't really
a bathroom.

No, it doesn't work, man.

Babe, if you ever want
to have sex again,

You will get out
of that bathroom.

I'm gonna hold it.
No, nothing works.

I'm gonna hold it.
That was a smart decision.

Why are there so many cameras
in this thing?

What were they doing in here?

I-I-i shudder to think.
We have four cameras.

We have two on the outside,
two on the inside.

I hate to think
of the amount of ass...

Amount of women that were filmed
in here without their knowledge.

That's making me feel
really safe,

And especially in the middle
of nowhere

With no cellphone service,
feeling really good about this.

I know this was my idea.

I know.

But...

Is this like a two-Lane road
we got going on here,

Or is this a one-bagger?

Stay right in the middle.

Really? Okay.

Maybe you shouldn't be
such a pussy.

See, it's not pulling over yet.

Now you back it up,
motherfucker.

That's right.

Bernadette!

Bernadette!

Check that out.
Back that ass up.

That's right.
Get out of my road.

There we go.
Thank you, ma'am.

Thank you, kind sir.
Is that a guy or a girl?

Thank you.

Wow.

I love that smell, though.

I'm glad we decided
to do this trip in the fall.

This is so pretty.

We are in the middle
of fucking nowhere.


[Window squeaking]

Teddy, do something funny.

Full service!


[British accent] Here we are,
in his natural environment.


Dangerous, dangerous predator,
a Joshua-cataranu.

Fierce.

Looks like your average,
garden-variety Italian.


But this gas station's
a variable greeding...

Breeding ground for joshes.

There he is zipping up.

Pants still down,
indicative of his species.

Alpha male. Here he is.

Oh, quick! Quick! Look!

He's coming closer!
Easy girl.

Oh, she's a beaut!

Drive.

Oh, fuck you!

[Chuckles]
God damn it!

Come on, Teddy.
Come on, Ted.

Stop the goddamn...

I lost paper towels!


Has he got beer?

Do you have the beer?
That's all we want.

Loaded, bro.
What are you doing?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Holy shit.

All right, guys,
you didn't say anything

About a gun in this thing.

Be careful with that, you guys.

That's the best place for it...
Just under my balls.


Are we rolling?
Picture's up. We are rolling.

We rolling. All right.

Okay, Michael.

No time like the present.

We're gonna get you to open up.

I'll be gentle.

I will do my best.
Okay. Okay.

We are shooting a documentary,

Directed by lovely girlfriend,
Anne,

About me coming back
to happy camp.

Mm-hmm. How long has it been?

Not to age yourself because I
know you're getting up there.

20 years.

The gray hair
says that already.

The gray hair is coming through
quite nicely.

It's been 20 years
since I've been back here.

I guess my biological mother
put me up for adoption.

I never knew my parents,

And I lived
with a few foster families

Until I was adopted
at the age of 9.

The tanners, Walt and Sandy,
were my parents for two years.

They picked me up
at the airport,

And that's how I came here.

I remember getting off the plane

And having, like, an airport
security person, I guess,

Escort me out, and Dean,
who became my brother,

And Walt and Sandy...

Like I said,
they were my parents...

They were waiting, and Dean had
a sign that said "Michael."

Aww.

Tell me about Walt and Sandy.

They were quiet. Nice.

They were very, very nice.

Didn't have a lot of money.

But you know, they were good
people, and they loved Dean.

Walt was an intimidating guy.

He was a big guy,
like a woodsman kind of guy.

I remember when I first met
them, he scared me,

And I remember
he had huge hands,

And he put his hand
on the back of my head,

And he just said, "you ready?"

I just kind of nodded,

Got in the car,
and drove to happy camp.

Mm.

Can you talk about
what happened with Dean?

What do you remember?


I was at the hospital,

And I just remember
for the next month

Being poked and prodded
by fucking doctors and cops

And all kinds of people asking
me that exact same question...

"What happened?"

We were playing in the backyard,

And to be honest, that's
the last thing I remember.

He was... he was...
He went missing.

How did Walt and...

Are you really gonna...?

Just how did they take it?

I don't know, Anne.

Not... not well, I guess.

After, um...

After Dean disappeared,

They kind of shut off, I guess,
and, uh...

I can't fucking believe this.

Sorry. [Sniffles]

Honey, I think this is the
first time I've seen you cry.

Great.

They took about four months
after Dean was gone.

Social services came back

And told me I couldn't live
with the tanners anymore.

They deemed the home unfit,
I suppose,

And I was put back
in the system.

I went back to San Diego,

And I stayed
with billeted families...

With foster families
until I was 18.

Guys, what is that?

Oh, my God.
What is that?

I don't know. That wasn't there
when I was a kid.

What the fuck is that?

Look at this.

Is this it?

I'm actually nervous.

Going to be coming up the town
in just a second.

Okay, good because I don't know

How much Bernadette's
got left in her.

I got lights flashing here.

What?
Yeah. Not kidding.

Oh, my... yeah, I see it.

Shit. I don't know, man.

Oh, are we here?
Oh, shit.

Yeah, the r.V. Park
is right around the corner.

Wow. Look at the sign.
What is that?

Pull over, Josh.
I want to hop out real quick.

Right h... [Sighs] Oh, God.

Just pull over.
It's okay. It's on the way.

Keep it running. It'll be fine.
Just keep it running.

[Indistinct conversation]


Ready?

[Camera shutter clicks]

This is... everybody always
communicates where they are,

Whether you go upriver
or downriver.

This is the klamath.

And if you go upriver,
that's the karuk.

That's the tribe that...

So, can you tell me
if the beer store

Would be upriver or downriver?

It would be downriver.

All right.
It's actually...

We're going downriver, guys.

It's all downhill from here.
Are we gonna make it?

If you can get it...
If you can literally...

Do you even know
what you're doing?

Move it 15 feet, then we can
coast all the way down.

Does he know what he's doing?

That's some expert work.

So, what seems to be
the problem there?

Down the road?
Okay.

All right,
just head straight down.

This is highway 96.

We're gonna take this
for about 1/4 mile,

And then elk creek
is right up on the left.

Good sign.

Oh, shit.

That's a creepy look.

Here we are.

Wow.

Come here, honey.


Yeah.
Ooh!

Look at that.


Shit!

Bernie's done.
Dude, that's smoke.

Mike, it's just down this hill?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

Is it safe to drive it, though?

That looks like your radiator.

How much further?

It's literally about...
I don't know... 1/4 of a mile.

[R.V. Door opens]

Fuck.

Shit.

Aah.

Holy shit.

Yeah, that's fucked.

Mike!

Yeah.

Mike, it's smoking.

Oh, my.

Bernie's dead.

Yeah, that's the, uh...

That's your radiator.

Do you have a mechanic in town?

Yeah. That's a claim.

We can get a claim tomorrow, but
that means, hey, you know what?

She made it.
Thank God.

Big-time stuff.
Big-time stuff.

Bernadette.
Made it to the campground.

Teddy, yeah?
Yeah.

Are you okay, Ted?

Don't fist-bump me, though.

"Hold me."

The only thing I can think of
is, you know, it's here.

We got it here.
Let's just get situated.

We can check in
a little later on.

Let's just, I mean...

[Dog barking]

[Chickens clucking]

[Rooster crows]

[Rooster crows]


[Rooster crows]

It makes you wonder.

There's a lot of people
that go missing around here.

I mean, not just in happy camp,

But people go out into the woods

And they just don't come back,
you know.

Sometimes nobody ever finds out
what happens to them.

I'll show you later, if you go
to the cemetery, you know,

There's white crosses out there,

And most of those white crosses,
that's all that's there,

Is just a cross.

There's no bodies there because
they didn't find anything, so...

About 5:00, I think I got home.

It's just starting to get dark
a little bit

'Cause it starting to get dark
early at that point.

And I got home.

There was cop cars all over
at Mike and deano's place,

And I never saw Mike after that.

I mean, I never saw deano,
either,

But, I mean,
never knew what happened.

The only thing I heard

Was that there was a bunch
of blood in the backyard,

And I think they found
a shoe or something.

I don't remember much
other than that.

Come here!

Hey, what are you doing,
little buddy?

He's buried
in the cemetery here.

I think they put up a cross
for deano,

But I think that's all
they ever did.

See you later on?
Yeah.

We're staying down at elk creek,
so we're close by.

So, you gonna be around?
Yeah, I'll be around.

We'll see you then.
Yeah, good seeing you.

Good to see you, man.
Yeah.

Nice meeting you.
It was so nice to meet you.

[Dogs barking]

[Fire sizzling]

They found two people...
Man, woman... up there.

Yeah.

I don't know how long
they'd been dead.

Didn't know
what happened to them.

Still don't know what happened
to them, I guess.

Does that happen a lot
in the woods out here?

Well, a whole lot.
Yeah.

What do you think happened
to the people up there?

I don't have a clue.

[Birds chirping]

Do you remember Mike
and his brother?

Yeah.

Do you remember
when Dean went missing?

Yeah.

They never did find his body.

They abducted Dean somehow.

He must have had some money
or something on him.

Flatlanders, you people being
lost out here in the woods,

You flatlanders
don't belong up here.

Why don't we belong up here?

Because there's people...

There's things out there
in the woods that will get you.

I've heard some screams out here
at night here at my camp.

And they raise
the hair on my back.

Really?

That's how scary it is.

Just toodle down the fucking
road where you came from

And get the hell out of here

While there's still
a little light

Before those things
come out in the woods.

Come in.

We have a reservation
for Taylor, Anne.

Okay.

And you look very familiar
to me.

You've been here before.

Yeah, it's been a while.

What is your name?
Mike.

Are you from the Turner family?
Is that...

Tanner.
Tanner.

Mm-hmm.
Mike Tanner. Yes.

That... i remember that name.

Dina?
Correct.

Yeah, I remember you.

Thank you very much.
Great. Space 14.

Thank you very much.
Thank you.

What do you guys think so far?

What's your initial impression
of happy camp?

Is it me or is this
a little creepy?

That was there when I was
a kid, actually.

I remember we came here
one time with...


With my family, and that used to
scare the hell out of us.

I knew I left my Mountain lion
somewhere.


Is that real? No.

Yes. It's real.

No, it looks... shut up.

No, no, that was a real one.

That was taxidermied.

It's a really bad
taxidermy job then.

Yeah.
It's fucking plastic.

They coated in plastic.

Yeah, it's a goddamn statue.


Does that honestly look real
to you?

For a second, it did.

Seriously, guys,
none of you climb up there.


It's breathing. It's breathing.

[Laughs sarcastically]

It's over there.
Will you help me?

Help you as in hold the camera
while you go, or come with you?

There's a market for that.

What kind of film
do you want to make?

I just want to go
to the bathroom.


Okay. This looks disgusting.

Oh, my God.

I look wretched.

What is happening?

Oh, geez.


Oh, my God.

[Belt jingles]

[Electricity buzzing]

Hello?

[Belt jingles]

Hello?

[Electricity buzzes]


Oh, my God.

[Electricity buzzing]

What the fuck was that?

Aah!

Oh, my God!

Aah! Oh, my God.

Whoa, whoa. [Laughs]
Are you okay?

Oh, my God.

You good?
This place is so creepy.

Yeah, come on.

You okay, babe?

Yeah, I'll be fine.

I'm just... ugh...
Got the creeps.


Yeah, man, it's nuts.

It just has a totally different
vibe, you know.

It's not what I was
expecting at all.

Kyle and I were...
We were friends.

Dean, Kyle, and I
used to hang out all the time

When we were kids.

I was showing Annie
around the park

And took her into the rec room
here and ran into Kyle.

I got to be honest, man.

I didn't think it would
bother me as much as it does.

But now, being back, you know,
it bothers me.

It bothers me
that they never found Dean,

You know what I mean?

Yeah,
they never found anything.

Whatever happened
to Walt and Sandy?

I think Walt ended up basically
drinking himself to death.

She, I think, divorced him not
too long after that happened...

Maybe a couple years.

And I never heard anything
about what happened to her.

A year and a half or so after
you disappeared.

So Walt... Walt...

He's buried in the cemetery
out here, yeah.

I think there's a stone
for Dean, too, there.

I haven't been out there
in years.

There is a... there is a...

I think there's a little stone,
but... yeah.

Really?

Yeah, we didn't know that.

[Voice breaking] Sorry, man.
It's just... [sniffles]

[Normal voice] It's a lot
of... it's a lot of shit

At all at once.
Yeah, it's all good, man. Yeah.

Does he have, um... A plot?

Yeah, there's...
I think they put up...

They did?

I think Walt ended up
putting up a stone

Probably about a year
before he ended up dying,

Something like that.

Well, can... can we go?

Can you show us?
Do you want to go?

Yeah, I can show you guys.
I'd appreciate that.

I'd really, really appreciate.
Yeah, not a problem.

Do you think you'll be okay?

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Do we turn up here or up there?

[Indistinct conversation]

Do you see it?

I'm gonna look.

Yeah, go.

Are you... do you want me
to go with you,

Or do you want to take a minute?

No, that's okay.
Okay.

Yeah, I'm just gonna...

[Dog howling in distance]

Yeah.

You don't want to go
in the cemetery?

I'm not going in.

Yeah.

See all those white crosses?

Most of those,
there's no bodies there.

So these are all
missing people?

Most of them.

Most of them where it's
just a cross, yep.

It's not just a few.

No, there's a ton of them.

Yep.

What's going on up here?


People go missing.
Nobody ever knows what happened.

They're just gone.

But you don't want to think
about...

You got to put something
to mark the fact

That someone's not here anymore.

But yeah, you keep looking
around here.

Dean really wasn't
the only one.

No.

There's a lot of people
disappeared.

Like I said, about...
I don't know...

It's probably twice a year
at least

It's in the news
that somebody disappeared,

And I'm sure
it's more than that.

Not really anything else
you can say about it.

[Dog whining in distance]

It's a shame.

A lot of good people just aren't
around anymore 'cause of this.

What's "this?"
What do you think "this" is?

I don't know.

Like I said,
I didn't want to say anything

When Mike was right here, but...

Oh, my God.

Yeah.

Guys, I'm gonna go up there
and talk to him for a minute.

Just... you guys just...

Hold back for just a minute,
okay?

I'm gonna...

All right.
Make sure he's okay.

Okay.

I don't want to go up there.

You guys good?

Are you okay?

Yeah. Yeah.

Thanks for showing us, Kyle.

Yeah. Not a problem.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jesus Christ!

Well, what the hell was that?

That was probably
your first warning.

You guys might want to get
back to the r.V.

Do you know that guy?

I've seen the truck before.

Probably doesn't like you
snooping around the cemetery.

A lot of locals don't like
people nosing around.

I'd get back to the r.V.
If I was you.

Don't be wandering
around at night.

Yeah, let's go.
All right.

Let's get out of here.

It was different.

It was different than I thought
it was gonna be.

Yeah, me too.

It was more emotional
than I thought it was gonna be.

No kidding.
I didn't expect that.

Yeah.

It was nice seeing Kyle,
though.

It was really nice seeing Kyle.

What did you think of him?
Oh, man.

I'd like to go to my old house
tomorrow, if that's okay.

Is that okay? Heck yes.


Yeah, if you want to.
You think so?

Mm-hmm. I do.


Oh, my God.
Shh.

What was that?

What the fuck is that?

There's something
fucking out there.

There's something out there.

Fuck this shit.

What was that?

Hold on. Stay here. Stay here.

Fuck them.

Are you...
You're going outside?

I'm sick and fucking tired
of this shit.

Teddy!

I'm not gonna be fucked with
by these people.

Stay. Come on.
Ted, don't go outside.

Pieces of shit!
Teddy! Ted!

What is he doing?

[Breathing heavily]

Oh, my God, you guys!

Sit down, sit down, sit down.

[Breathing heavily]

Josh. Josh.

[Dogs howling in distance]

Stay inside.

[Wind whistling]


Mike?



[Floor creaks]


Guys.

Hey, wake up. Guys.

Guys, I can't find Mike.


I don't know where he went.
He's not here.

I didn't...
Did you guys hear him leave?

No.
He didn't say anything?

No. I don't know where he went.

You get in a fight?

No. It was fine.
I don't know.

He's probably in the bathroom.

Will you come look with...
Will you call him?

Will you come look...
Josh, come look with me, please.

All right, I'll go.

I don't want
to go up there alone.

All right, I got it.

Thank you. Come on.

Oh, God.

Oh, that's fucking cold.

You gonna try your phone?

I'll call him.

All right.

Stupid.
No signal.

What?
No signal.

Shocker there.

Where the fuck did he go?

Fucking stupid.

This is getting ridiculous,
man.

Did you call him?
No signal.

Got nothing.
Did he leave a note?

Nothing. I don't...
There's nothing back here.

You didn't wake up
when he left?

I didn't wake up at all.

He's probably close by.
He's fine.

He's gonna be fine.
Let's just get dressed.

Let's get dressed and...
I don't know...

Maybe walk around more
and look for him.

Well, let's go look for him.
Let's do something.

I'm gonna go...
I'm gonna go crazy.

This is... i just have a really
bad feeling right now.

We can't drive.
Do you want to walk?

It's no accident
that millions of people

Wind up living in cities.

Do you know what you're doing?

Yeah, I'm... yep.

You sure?

Yeah. There's a clamp.

'Cause you're pissing water,

Like, all over the ground
right now.

No. Oh, shit!

Can you hand me the...


Why do they do these so tight?

Is this an American?

It's Mike.

I'm just gonna watch this one.

Will she hit him?

I don't know.

Push or hit?

Push or a hit?

Ball check?

Hey, big guy.
Hey.

Maybe leave a note next time,
huh?

I'm sorry.

I didn't... i thought you guys

Would honestly
still be sleeping.

I honestly thought
I'd still be sleeping, too.

Well, I went to Al's in town.

Got a clamp for the hose.

Josh, you might think about
taking surface roads,

That way we don't get caught up
in downtown traffic.

You sure?
Yeah.

It can be a nightmare.

It can take upwards
of two minutes to get through.


[Indistinct conversation]

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

What do you want?

You want to get out
and check that?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Getting out?

Yeah, there's a chain thing.

Okay, go ahead.
All right.

Yeah, there's nothing we can do
about this.

We're just gonna have to walk.

It's just right here.

All right.
Okay.

How are you doing? You good?
I'm good.

Yeah.

Come on.

Ooh.

You good?

Yeah.

Jesus.

Why am I having such a hard time
with this?

That used to be...
That pond used to be filled.

There was never any fish in it,
but Dean and I used to...

Walt got us a couple rods, and
we'd sit out there for hours.


We'd have the lines in the water

And constantly be like,
"did you get a bite?

Did you get a bite?"

Like, if anything moved, we'd be
like, "yeah, you got something."

But we never...
Never once caught a fish.

It looked a lot bigger
when I was a kid.

Oh.
Careful.

This is it, Mike?

Yeah.


Do you want to go in?

No. [Laughs]


Aah!

You okay?

I'm sorry.

This was it.

You wanted the... the real deal.

Believe it or not,
this is considered pretty...

Pretty lavish for happy camp.

It's...

So, on the other side of the
house, we had a functional...

A functional kitchen
that was hooked up to a well,

So that's where Sandy
did a lot of the cooking.

And heat came
from a wood-burning stove.

They slept there,

And Dean and I had a cot
that was here.

[Door creaks]

I didn't anticipate it.

It's very different
than what I remember,

And I didn't think that was
gonna be as hard as it is.

I remember that Dean
was always worried

Every time he'd get a new toy.

He'd always hide stuff around.

He'd always have, like, a hiding
spot under the house

Where he kept, like, a toy box
with everything that he loved.

This was...

This was some of his...

I remember I used to think,
when I was a little kid,

How neat would it be
to call somebody "mom"

And to call somebody "dad."

The one thing I never thought
about is how weird it would be

To actually call them mom
and dad when you see them.

It took a while.

It took a couple...
Almost six months, I think,

Before I could call Sandy "mom"
and Walt "dad."

Um... But yeah, it was...
It was nice.

It was nice having parents
for the first time.

And after Dean was gone,

It really just became
a matter of time.

I remember... i remember
Walt starting to drink a lot.

Sandy became very depressed.

I mean, Dean was their child,
you know.

They loved me
and I was their son.

Do you think they blamed you?
Hmm?

Do you think they blamed you?


I don't know what exactly
happened to him.

But I do believe that there is
someone else involved.

There is someone or something
that took him.

He's gone.
He's not coming back.

It doesn't matter what I think.

It doesn't matter
what I could tell them.

It doesn't matter.

It's stupid.

You can't change the past,
so it is what it is.

What do you think I'm doing?

What do you think I'm doing?

I'm trying everything I can.

We're back at the place
where I lost my brother

And I still can't
fucking remember!

What do you think I'm doing?!

What's the last thing...

I'm sorry. I think we're good.

I'm not mad at you, Mike.

I'm trying this
for your stupid film.

I'm trying to open up
as much as I can.

I'm telling you
I don't remember!

I didn't remember then.
I don't remember now.

What do you want me to tell you?
You want me to fucking lie?

You want to lie for...

No, I just... none of this
is making sense to me at all.

Well, this is it.
This is what you wanted.

This is where it happened.

[Voice breaking] I was
sitting here with Dean,

And the last thing I remember...

And then I woke up,
and it was two days later,

And everybody was poking
and prodding at me

The same fucking way you are!

And I don't know
what to tell you! I'm sorry!

Okay, I'm sorry that I can't
give you more for your stupid...

I'm gonna take off.

I'm gonna...
I'm gonna walk back.

You're not taking off.
Yeah. Yeah.

I don't...
I just need an hour or so.

Mike.

Are you guys
just gonna let him walk off?

Mike!

One of you guys go after him.

Teddy, will you...

Mike!

Mike!
Mike.

Fuck!

Ted, go check him out.

What the fuck's he doing?

He left.

He's walking to town.

You know what? Just let him go.

We're not...

I know. Come on.
Just let him go.

He does this all the time.

Freezing, and it's like
five Miles away.

Where's he gonna go, you know?

Hell if I know.

You're just gonna let him go?

Yeah, he does this
all the time.

How would you feel spilling
all this shit out, you know?

Anne.
Anne, he's leaving.

He left.
He's gone.

I know he left.

What did you do?

I didn't do anything, you guys.

You can't push him
to talk about this.

I'm not pushing him.

this is where it happened.

You're sort of pushing him.

This is where it happened,
okay? Right here in this spot.

This is the last thing
he remembers, okay?

Right here behind his house?

You could be
a little sensitive to...

You guys, I'm trying.

I didn't know any of this
was going on.

You didn't know
any of this shit?

He's never talked about this
before to me.

He painted a completely
different picture.

This is just not at all...

Do you think I would've
come up to this?

This is ridicu... this is crazy.

He lied to you?

I don't know. I don't think
he remembered it this way.

I don't think... i don't...
I don't know.

I don't know
what's going on with him.

[Voice breaking]
He's never done this before.

You guys, we got to go find him.

We'll find him,
but quit having him talk.

We got to just go.
We'll go back to town.

Where the fuck could he be?

Well, we're gonna go
back to town.

We'll find him there.

He just needs some time
to cool off, okay?

There's probably only
two places he can be.


A bar or in the woods.

Yeah.

There's not much here.

Kicking it with Kyle?

Oh, my God. I mean...

I understand it's difficult
to grow up

In the environment that he did,
but...

No, this is, like,
"environment."

This is another planet.

Mike!

Shh.

[Dog barking]

There, that's a good try.

Nice. That was awesome, Ted.
Thanks.

Sheriff's office.

Well, what we could do is...

Knock on the door?

Well, yes.

But let's try to talk to him.

Maybe he knows
some stuff about Dean.

Maybe we can talk to him

About some of the stuff
with Mike's parents,

Maybe they...
About some of the leads.

I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

Like, really?
Does it really matter anymore?

Yeah, it matters.

I mean, obviously, you saw
how upset Mike got back there.

I think we're a little beyond

This fallacy
of what you're trying to do,

And maybe we should
just find Mike

And get the fuck out of here.

That didn't work.

Maybe try the yelling thing
again? I don't know.

Guys, we just need to...

Mike!

Where is he, the bar?

Could be. I don't know.

There's another door right here,
you guys. Come on.

It's the...

There you go.

Check this out. Come on.

Go in there with her.
I'm gonna check upstairs.

Hello?

Come on.

Hello?


Did you hear that, Josh?

Hello?

Okay?

Excuse me?

Hello?


Come on, Josh.

Excuse me!

Hello?

Annie!

What?

Oh, my God. Come on, Josh.

Josh, come on.

Teddy! Teddy!

Teddy! Ted!

Ted.

Ted.

That's Mike's brother.

So many.

He's not here. Let's go.

Let's go.

I feel nauseous.

Guys, this thing is bigger
than just Dean.

There's got to be 200 people
on that wall.

At least, and then you saw
the graveyard.

Yeah, I saw it.

You guys, we got to find Mike
right now.

A little quiet there, Ted.

Is that Mike?

Mike!
Mike!

Hi there.
Mike!

No, I don't think so.

Yeah, I am.

Did you wreck it?

It's him.

What the fuck are you doing,
Mike?

What are you doing?
Jesus Christ.

We don't want you here no more.

What does that even mean,
you know what I did?

The only way you can come back

Is if you bring your brother
with you.

Go.

Just go!

Where the fuck were you?

What the fuck are you doing,
man?

[Voice breaking]
Where the fuck were you?

I told you, I wanted...
No, you're a fucking asshole.

That's what you are.

Twice... that's twice today,
you son of a bitch.

You can't have the decency
to just cut me some time.

You're the one that wanted...
the decency?

You didn't have the decency
to walk away from me

Twice today, you son of a...
Fucking asshole.

This is turning into
a fucking soap opera.

Does nobody understand...

Walk away from you, Mike.
How does that feel?

Mike, we walked around
for hours, looking for you.

Just have some respect for us,
yeah?

Do you not...

I understand the situation,
but just come on, man.

You don't know what this whole
thing was about?

All about you, bro.

What the fuck does that even
mean, it's all about me?

Just quit yelling.
What do you think it means?

We're sitting around for
three hours, looking for you.

I just said I needed a little
bit of time today, that's all.

You didn't say anything.
That's all. That's the problem.

Yeah, you just left
for the second time today.

Listen to me.

I know you're going through
some shit,

But just let us know
what you're doing.

Do you really understand?

No, I don't pretend
to understand.

But can you just tell us where
you're going for Christ's sake?

None of this makes sense
anymore.

This is not at all
what we signed up for.

This is exactly
what we fucking...

You see that?
That's exactly what happened.

That's exactly
what we fucking signed up for!

Great.
Why don't you walk away again?

I just needed some space today,
that's all, man. I'm sorry.

I know.
This is stressful on everybody.

You think I like doing this?

Fuck off, Mike.
This is retarded.


No, I'm so...

For Christ's sake, Annie,
what do you want me to say?

You know, you knew that this was
gonna be fucking difficult.

What do I want you to say?
Oh, okay. Again, all my fault.

If you run away...
You run away all day.

Just let's continue
this conversation

Maybe at another time.

Right now, let's go.

Mike.

Well, if he can walk away,
so can i.

Stop.
Get away from me.

Why don't we just go in here,
have a drink?

Maybe you can calm her down
for five seconds.

All right.

And let's get the fuck
out of here tomorrow.

Yeah, you can check out
the local bar.

Let's go to the r.V.
And have a drink.

I don't want to fucking hang
around this town anymore.

What do you want to do?
I want to go home.

You don't think
I want to stay here?

We'll get him out of here.

Have a drink and let's get
the fuck out of here.

[Indistinct conversations]

To happy camp.

* this is the worst trip
I've ever been on *


He's been gone since.

Nobody's really heard from him,
so...

I haven't heard anybody
hear from him.

Yeah.

It's a very similar story.

And they didn't find him
for quite some time.

I don't think they ever
have found him.

No, they didn't. No.

They don't know.

They remember finding shreds
of his clothes here and there.

They what?

They remember finding shreds
of his clothes here and there

And half of his shoe,
part of his pants.

It was kind of strange.

I don't know
what happened there.

It's really sad.

We were here in happy camp

The night
that that child disappeared

Right across the street.

Okay.


Everybody still
thinks about it,

Still wonders
what the hell happened.

But I never heard anything else
about that.

Was the town ever the same
after that?

No. Not at all.

Everybody still thinks about it,

Still wonders
what the hell happened.

I promised Annie I wasn't gonna
smoke for this thing.

That's the least
of our concerns tonight.

Yep.

Was the bartender
talking about your dad?

Yeah, yeah.
I kind of remember him.

I know he said
he sort of knew Walt,

But he was closer with him
than I think he was saying.

He really didn't say much.

Are you sure you knew
everything about your father?

I don't know.

Not now.

I have no fucking idea,
just to be honest with you, man.

This is totally different
than what I remember.

Tommy, come here, babe.

Yeah, here.

Huh?
You need to talk to this guy.

Who the...
I'll talk to him.

No, you don't.

You're that fucking guy
from that fucking...

Please just...

Okay.
Come on!

Annie!

[Chuckles]
That is so creepy.

What do the local economy
and bigfoot have in common?


There's no proof
that either exists.

Guys, come on.
We're right there. We're going.

Oh, my God.

Hey, look, Ted.

They give you a number to call.

Mike, hold up.

Get to the r.V., we're all gonna
pass out and be fine.

Okay.

I'm not even into this anymore,
Anne.

You guys should be warm enough.
You drank enough.

Fucking retarded.

What the fuck?

What the fuck is that?

What is it?

What the fuck is that?

Where the fuck are we?

Shh.

They take our shit?
Are you kidding me?

Is our shit gone?
Are you fucking kidding me?

Oh, my God.

This is your fault.
Everything's still...

What the hell is happening?

Because you made this
about something

Totally fucking different,
like going around asking locals

A bunch of stupid
fucking questions.

Ted?

Yeah?

Where you at?

I can't fucking believe this.

Okay, you guys, I'm...

This doesn't make any sense.
They didn't take anything.

Hey!

Hey!

Who messed with the r.V.?
Hey.

Oh, what the shit is this?
Are you kidding me?

Let's go. Let's go now.
She's moving in there.

Come on.
I see you!

They're not gonna...
Let's get the fuck out of here.

Let's go.

There's nobody here.

Who the hell's out there?

Shh. Shh. Shh.

Fuck.

Who's in my woods?

Oh, my God!

Let's go! Go!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

Get in the truck.
Get in the truck right now.

Let's go.

Go, go, go, go.
I'm going. Guys.

Geez. Oh, my...
Mike, relax.

You're gonna hit her
in the face.

What's going on, man? Come on.

It won't stay on.

Let's go!
Start the fucking car!

I'm trying, guys! Stop!

Teddy, come with me.
The fucking light.

Bitch!

I mean, this is not
fucking happening.

[Engine revs]

Get in.

Jump in. Be careful.

All right, let's go.
Aah! Oh, my God, you guys.

Everyone in, everyone safe?

Yeah, we're good. Just drive.
Just drive the goddamn truck.

Fuck.

Shit.

Guys.

You guys okay?

Oh, shit.

[Engine rumbling]

Shit. Fuck.

What is it doing?
What is it doing?

Fuck.
Josh, what is it doing?!

It's fucked!

Josh, w... [Sighs]

Teddy, come on. Teddy, come on.

Try and start it.

Teddy.

[Engine idling]

Shit!

Just clamp that fucking thing!

I can't! It's the fucking...

There's a hole the size
of my fucking hand in there.

[Engine sputters]

Go a little further.

Mike, this won't work?

No, no.
There's nothing you can do.

We're fucking stranded.

Try it again.
Josh, it's not gonna start.

Annie, it won't start.
The hose is off the radiator.

It can't fucking start.

You can try it 50 fucking times!
It's not gonna st...

I'm not staying in this town
anymore, Mike.


Son of a bitch.


You guys.

We're not staying here.

No, we're not fucking st...
We're not staying here.

What... what are we doing?

What are we,
like a mile out of town?

This is your town. You tell us.

All right.

Not even 1/4 mile back
there was a house.

There was a light on.
I'll walk to it.

I'll see if we can get
some fucking duct tape.

Mike, it's 3:00 in the morning.

Well, do you have
a better plan?

No, I don't have a better plan.

You're gonna hoof it
through the woods

To try and find a clamp
for an engine part?

I'll go back. I'll see...
They had a light on...

I'll see if they have something
to hold...

Mike's running away again
like a little fucking girl.

Oh, that's nice.
That's really fucking nice.

I was just trying to come up
with a fucking solution!

Come up with another one.

I don't know why that's
such a fucking problem.

If you want to leave us
in the middle of the woods,

Then fucking do it, Mike.

It's got nothing to do
with me leaving!

I don't want to fucking be here
anymore!

Well, you're making a pretty
good habit out of it!

All weekend long, Mike!

You know what?
Fuck you and fuck you, too!

I'm gonna go back.

I'm gonna see
if I can find something

To fix this fucking problem!

Well, find a set of tires, too,
while you're at it!

Man, fuck you! Fuck you!

Look around!
Look the fuck around, man!

You got a better idea?

You got a better
fucking idea, Ted?

No! You don't have a plan!

What do you want me
to fucking do?

Walk away then!

That's what you've been doing
all fucking weekend!

Just go. Just go.
That's not fucking fair.

That's not fucking fair!
Teddy. Teddy!

Just go back. I'll go with...

What do you even fucking know
about it anyway, man?

I don't pretend to know shit
about it, Mike!

Then why give me
such a hard fucking time?

I don't know why
that's why so difficult for you

To fucking comprehend that I
don't want to stay here anymore.

None of us want to stay here,
man.

Fine. Then let me go.
I'll be back in half an hour.

I'm just gonna see
if I can find something.

It's a solution
to the fucking problem.

You're kidding yourself.

Teddy, just go back to the r.V.
Go back to the r.V.

Fine.

You're gonna come?

Teddy?

He left.

What? Let him go.

Here, take this.

Awesome idea.

Can't wait to figure out
how fucked up Mike is.


So, you gonna keep giving me
the silent treatment?

Watch the branch.

I'm sorry, okay?

Annie, come on,
you're being ridiculous.

I should've let you know
where I was going. I'm sorry.

Mike, I'm not mad. I'm just...

I want to get out of here
just as much as you do, okay?

Can we just call a truce,
please?

Hmm?

Give me a hug.

I love you, okay?

I love you, too.

Take my hand.

I think we should build
a fire pit, yeah?

Pretty sure it has to be dry.


Did you hear that?

A lot of animals out here.

Get that fire going.
Maybe we can scare them off.

Be careful here.

God, what is that smell?

Is that your house?

Yeah.

What [Gasps]

What was that?
Mike, did you hear that?


Mike?

Mike.

Michael!

Michael!

Mike!


Mike. Mike!

Mike?

Mike.

Michael.

Michael.

What is going on?

What is going on, Mike?

Shh, shh, shh, shh.
What are these?

What do these mean?

This is a beauty.


Teddy?
What is it?

Ted, get the light.
Josh, what is that?

Ted, get the fucking light.
Josh, what is that?

I don't know, Teddy!
Get the light!

Hello?

Is that a big dog?

Wait, Josh, what is it?
I don't know.

Tell me what was going on!

I remember
what happened to Dean!

Listen. Listen to me.

We were here.
We were right here.

I was playing... come here.
I was playing.

We were sitting right here
when it started to get dark.

Dean... he said he was cold.

He said he was cold.

We heard something,
and he... come here.

What happened to him?
He got up. He got up.

What happened to him?

And I told him...

We heard something
and he was scared,

And he came behind me,

And I know that because he was
squeezing my arm!

What took him?

I don't know
what the fuck that...

Hello?

Hello?

[Creature roars]

We saw it.
Mike.

We saw it. It was big.
Mike, what was out there?

It looked like that...
And I tried.

[Voice breaking] I couldn't
save him and I tried.

Mike, what was it?!
[Twig snaps]

What is it?

Listen to me. Listen to me.
This isn't safe.

This isn't safe.
Annie, this isn't safe!

Josh, get the gun.

Go, go, go, go! Now!

Come on, come on, come on!

Move it! Move it! Move it!
Give me the bullets, Ted!


Bullets!
Here! Right here! Go!

Load it! Load it!

What the fuck was out there,
man?

Load the fucking gun!


What do we do?
We have to get out of here.

We have to get out of here,
okay?

We have to get out of here!

Run!


Aah!

[Dog barking]

Fuck.

[Screaming]
Annie!

Run!
Annie!

Teddy!
Oh, my God!

Oh, m-Mike.

Mike, come on.

Get up. We got to go now.

Run!

Go, go!
Get inside! Get inside!


Oh, my God.
Mike, what was that?

Turn off the light!

Shh. Shh.

It's okay.

[Wood cracks]
Aah! Jesus!


What the fuck is that?


Annie!
Oh, my God.

Annie!

Annie!

Aah!

[Bones crack]

Shit!

Teddy!



Help!

[Creature roars]

Ted!

Teddy!

Come on! Come on! Go! Go!

Run!
Go, honey!

Run!

Come on, come on!

Come on, run! Move! Move! Move!

Keep going! Keep going!
Go, go, go!

Run!
Aah!

Come on, go! Come on, get up.

Come on, come on, come on,
let's go. Move! Move! Move!

Oh, my God!
Come on!

Don't look! Don't look!

Oh, my God!
Annie, no!

Teddy! Teddy! Help me!
Help me!

Teddy! No! God, no!

Annie, he's gone.
He's gone, Annie. Come on.

Come on, we got to go.
We got to go.



[Creature growls]

[Wind whistling]

Keep running!
Don't stop! Don't stop! Come on!

What is that? Josh! Josh!

Oh, my God.
Aaaah!

What the fuck is happening?!
Aah!

Come on! Get in! Get in!

Aah! Oh, my God.

[Both panting]

Shh. Shh. Shh.

Just stay here. Stay here.

Oh, my God, oh, my God.

Annie, look at me. Look at me.
It's gonna be okay. Okay?


[Both panting]

[Creature growls]


I'm sorry. Look at me.

[Creature roars]

Just stay inside.

Mike. No!
Stay inside!

[Creature roars]
No!

Aah!

[Creature snarling]

[Creature roars]


[Crying continues]

[Dog barks in distance]

It was just over 700
bone fragments in two weeks,

And four people
have been identified

From those bone fragments.

And we're still finding
body parts.

And I looked up at the clock.

That's why I know it was
3 minutes to 12:00.

And I started hearing...

It sounded like an animal
being mauled.

They're out there.

They are out there.

They found a guy floating
in the water right down there.

I know in my mind that they
wouldn't be afraid of me

As I should be afraid of them
'cause they're bigger than me.

I saw one here up South fork
and I saw one in little creek.

It freaked me out
'cause I thought, "oh, my God."

And that was the first thing
I thought...

Mountain lion or something.

And all of a sudden,

It caught whiff of us
for some reason.

Wind blowing the wrong way
or something.

That bigfoot took off
up the trail.

Another of my friends gone.

People die up and down the river
here all the time.

A bear can't run that fast
on two legs.

A bear runs on four legs.

Bigfoot runs on two legs.

Oh, dude, they didn't come up
with anything about it,

But yeah, I'm running out
of friends here.

It ran up, ran around
the corner into a ravine.

That's the last we saw of it.

It stayed right in here.

It didn't leave
for about a good half-hour.

It just stayed right in here.

It was like it was watching us.

Sure, I believe in bigfoot,
but I've never seen bigfoot.

There's a lot of things that I
can't see that I can believe in.

[Somber music plays]

[Harley wood's "poor excuse
4 a human" plays]

that I like to do *

about you because it's true *

* you're a poor excuse
for a human *

* these choice words
