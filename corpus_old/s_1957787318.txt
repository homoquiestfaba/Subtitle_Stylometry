T-minus 15, 14, 13.

T-minus 10, nine, eight,

seven, six, five,

four...

Main engine starts.

[rock music plays]

[speaking Russian]

-Boo! -Ah!


[alarm blares]

Speak English, they wonâ€™t understand you.

Now, go. Go!




We canâ€™t let these monsters escape!

Once they get into the ocean,

itâ€™s over, theyâ€™ll be unstoppable.

This is the only way to end it for good.

Ah!

What have we done?

Letâ€™s go, it can be fixed!


Theyâ€™re coming, theyâ€™re coming!

I donâ€™t know how to work this thing, do you?

Donâ€™t you remember your Cosmonaut training?

Turn on the engines and hit the gas!


Figure it out, Sergei!

Theyâ€™re about the break through!

Sergei, hurry up! Thereâ€™s more coming!

Once we hit ten thousand meters, theyâ€™ll have no oxygen.

Hurry up, theyâ€™re almost in!

Nearly there!

Sergei!

I think I got it!

I canâ€™t overload it, but I can launch it!

One minute starting now!

I need more time, I need more time!

Iâ€™ll give you more time.

No, Aloysha! Come back!

Okay.




No!


Check main booster, propellant diagnostics are green.

Gyro navigation systems are online.

Orbital stabilization thrusters purged and ready.

This is Tabula Rasa to mission control,

final walkthrough complete.

All systems running at 100 percent.

We have confirmed "go" for launch by all parties.

T-minus nine minutes and counting.

Roger that, mission control.

Engineer Gilmour, whatâ€™s our status?

Green across the board, Commander, and...

and...

ooh, oh, wow, I think I shouldnâ€™t have had those tacos.

I told you not to trust that food truck.

I think itâ€™s something else.

Gilmour?

Iâ€™ll just do a couple of tests.

Iâ€™m just gonna touch here.

Ah!

Ah, ah!

We got a possible appendicitis.

No, no, no...

Captain...

-Itâ€™s just... mm. -Sheâ€™s not clear to fly.

Mission control, Engineer Gilmour

has fallen ill and needs medical attention.

We need to delay the launch.

No can do, Commander.

Delaying the launch would set us back six months.

Thatâ€™s going to be a huge setback

that we canâ€™t handle.

We will alert the alternate. Heâ€™s standing by.

Shit.

Commander Tress, alternate astronaut is en route.

Tabula Rasa, start auxiliary power units

and activate APUs.

APUs on.

Felt like this day would never come.

We are finally going to the moon.

As long as the alternate shows up.

Arming solid rocket booster

Sequence ready.

Arm and safe devices a go.

The alternate should be joining you in a minute.

SRBs and devices clear.

I know none of us are happy about it,

but heâ€™s the best at what he does...

maybe even better than Gilmour.

We canâ€™t delay this mission another six months.

Howdy, boss.

Prepped and ready to go to the moon.

I hear the commute is a killer.

Michael, for the last time,

Iâ€™m not your boss, Iâ€™m your commander.

Roger that, Commander.

Begin aero surface profile test.

Aero profile surface test activated, Commanderino.

Mission control, profile test complete.

Copy.

Proceed with main engine gimbal profile test.

Retract the gaseous vent arm.

Michael, please take this seriously.

This mission is far too important to humanity, got it?

You donâ€™t have to worry about me, Commander

Iâ€™m here to work.

Commander, power status.

Power is running at 100 percent, no alarms.

Transferring communication module power from ground

to internal.

Activating launchpad sound suppression system.

Activating main engine burn-off in T-minus 10.

Copy. Guidance is internal.

We will begin ground launch sequencer

for auto sequence start.

We are still go.

T-minus 27 seconds and counting, Commander.

Roger that, mission control.

Everyone ready to go to the moon?

Oh shoot...

What is it, Michael?

I think I left my stove on.

Remind me to not leave you alone in the galley.

Luckily, NASA has ensured this ship

is mitigated against all excessive heat forms,

just so long as we donâ€™t land in the Compton Belkovich

volcanic complex on the far side,

we should be safe, even from Liamâ€™s cooking.


Ten, nine, eight,

seven...

Starting main engine.

six, five,

four, three,

two, one.

Godspeed, Tabula Rasa.

Roger that, mission control.

Ignition.

Liftoff.


Thereâ€™s the thermosphere.

Now for the exosphere.

Wow.


Mission Control to Tabula Rasa.

That is a successful launch.

I repeat, a successful launch.

Woo!

Current navigation track to the moon appears clear

and artificial gravity magnification is complete.

Roger that, mission control.

Tom, confirm navigation settings.

Navigation settings confirmed.

ETA to the moon, 68 hours, 42 minutes, and 15 seconds.

That tracks with our settings.

Signing off for now, but will continue to monitor.

Congratulations, Tabula Rasa.

Nice work, everyone.

Now the real work begins.

Gravity normalizers engaged.

All right, Iâ€™ll be in the galley making popcorn,

if anybody needs something.

-[laughing] -What? Câ€™mon.

Howâ€™s it looking? Everything still on schedule?

Uh, sure...

just trying to make a renewable source of energy

that will support generations of thousands of people

living on the moon, no big deal.

If anyone can make this fuel work, itâ€™s you.

You led the team that discovered what,

a thousand new uses for algae?

Whatâ€™s one more, right?

Thanks, Commander, that means a lot.

You know, my dad keeps saying if weâ€™re successful,

theyâ€™ll have towns on the moon named after us soon enough.

Think about it...

Adams City.

Tressburg.

Donâ€™t go looking for condos just yet.

Go for Commander Tress.

Go for Tress.

Commander, we have a bit of electromagnetic disturbance,

probably due to the Van Allen radiation belt.

Itâ€™s nothing out of the ordinary, but...

What does that mean?

Weâ€™ve been on a bit of a run, but we should be fine.

But weâ€™ll have to adjust our landing by a degree.

But we should still be able to land in the West Crater.

Keep an eye on it.

Let Ellie and mission control know right away.

Henri and Michael as well.

Copy, weâ€™re having trouble reaching out to mission control

due to the interference, but Iâ€™ll keep trying.

Roger that.

Iâ€™m about to go on my sleep shift, but donâ€™t hesitate

to wake me the second anything changes.

Are we okay, Commander?

Be ready for anything.

Iâ€™m gonna get some shut-eye.

I suggest you do the same.

Itâ€™ll be all hands once we make our approach.

Sounds good, Commander.

Quequio satellite sighted.

Navigation holding steady?

Yes, current descent is only 46 feet from our initial site.

Final run-through at 100 percent,

confirmed by Michael, Henri, and yours truly.

Come in, Commander Tress,

we are ready to initiate orbital lunar descent.

Confirmed.

Tabula Rasa Crew, report to command module

for initial orbital lunar descent

in T-minus 5 minutes and counting.

Go back, go back!

Whoa...

Everyone, get your asses up here, now!

[alarm blares]

Status report.

Commander, we are reading that you are veering off-course

by 24.2 degrees, please advise.

Weâ€™re not getting back on-course.

Mission control, we had some interference from the Van Allen,

but we course-corrected.

Thereâ€™s no way itâ€™s causing this much interference.

Copy, Tabula Rasa.

We suggest, uh...


Hello?

Hello, mission control, do you copy?

Mission control, I repeat, do you copy?

We lost them.

Henri, Michael, we need a diagnostic

of the electrical components of the nav system.

-On it. -Copy, boss.

The hardwareâ€™s fried, the systemâ€™s completely overloaded.

Somethingâ€™s scrambling the computer to continually reset.

My electromagnetic readings are off the charts.

Interference shouldnâ€™t increase exponentially like this.

Iâ€™m not getting control, we need to do something, now.

Restart the ship.

What?

We should regain emergency control.

Oxygen and gravity are on separate systems,

so those should hold.

Captain, thatâ€™s insane.

But Commander, we have no time.

Weâ€™ll be propelled to the far side

in T-minus 95 seconds.

Itâ€™s either this, or we crash and explode.

Restart the ship.

Sheâ€™s holding.

Sheâ€™s holding.

Wait... navigationâ€™s not course-correcting.

Sixty seconds till weâ€™re flung to the far side.

We need to manually maneuver the ship.

Michael, can you slow us down by adjusting the rocket boosters?

I can keep us flying long enough to not go "kaboom."

Weâ€™ll be flung to the far side of the moon before then.

If that happens we need to get

as close as possible to the Von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n crater.

We can use parts from the Changâ€™e-4 lander

and Yutu-2 rover to fix the ship.

Michael, Henri, adjust the rockets, slow us down.

On it.

When we land, we can use the Quequio relay satellite

to make contact.

Thatâ€™s the only thing on the far side that can reach Earth.

Assuming we land in one piece.

Okay.

Anything?

Itâ€™s not working.

That was the satellite.

We wonâ€™t be able to contact mission control.

That wonâ€™t matter if we donâ€™t survive this landing.

Michael, Henri, the rockets.

Nothing yet, Commander.

Keep her as steady as possible.

Roger that, Commander.

Itâ€™s not working, we have to do it manually.

Anything?

Itâ€™s working.

[garbled transmission]

...right for the Changâ€™e 4!

Brace for impact!


Michael, Henri, are you okay?

All good, Commander.

Weâ€™re locked out of the systems.

We need to figure out a way to get back to Earth...

now.

Status report... is anyone hurt?

Negative, Commander, weâ€™re all good here.

System says no hull breaches, either.

But that Changâ€™e 4 rover was our best chance

to communicate with mission control.

It doesnâ€™t matter.

The satelliteâ€™s gone, and the only thing

on the far side of the moon that can communicate with Earth,

we destroyed.

Iâ€™ll never see my dad again.

We wonâ€™t see anyone again.

Mission control knows we crashed on the far side.

If they donâ€™t hear from us in the next few hours,

the best they can try to do any time soon

will be to figure out a way to communicate.

But that could take days or longer,

especially without the Quequio satellite.

Weâ€™re all alive.

We need to assess and see whatâ€™s available, and for how long.

Weâ€™ll probably have to get back on our own.

Of course.

Tom, Henri, status report?

Weâ€™ve lost most of our power.

Owen, please tell me life support is still functional.

Okay, okay...

Um...

we should be okay on oxygen.

We have enough in reserve to last six months.

Our food source is supposed to mimic that as well.

We are equipped to grow vegetation,

so we should get some fresh food if weâ€™re here for a while.

And so long as there arenâ€™t any hull breaches

and no one opens any doors or windows,

we should be able to maintain a moderate temperature

inside the modules for months.

And if there arenâ€™t any leaks, weâ€™ll be fine.

Iâ€™ll do a walkthrough, then a moonwalk,

to ensure thereâ€™s no external damage.

See? Weâ€™re all safe.

How far away are we from the Yutu-2 rover?

Rough estimate, about a mile.

Is there any way to contact mission control from the Yutu-2?

No, the only way to reach Earth from the far side

was through the Quequio relay satellite.

Which we destroyed.

Exactly.

So, Michael, Henri, youâ€™re coming with me

to retrieve whatever components we can from the Yutu-2 rover,

use it to get Tabula Rasa up and running,

at least to the near side, so we can make contact.

Iâ€™m coming too.

The Yutu-2 houses several spectrometers.

I could pull a whole one or scavenge it for parts.

No, if itâ€™s operational, weâ€™ll drive it back here.

You can get what you need from it then.

And what if itâ€™s not?

Then weâ€™ll be missing out on potentially life-saving tech.

Fine.

Ellie, I need the rest of you to take stock

of all the damage you can find.

Make sure all supplies and experiments

are still operational, and if possible,

chart a course back home.

Weâ€™ll need every bit of oxygen, water,

and sustenance accounted for.

We could be here for a while.

Weâ€™re on it, Commander.

And Josie, make sure the life support module

is fully operational.

If that breaks, we have no chance of going back.

Copy, Commander.

All right, team, letâ€™s suit up.

All right, itâ€™s at least a 20-minute hike.

Everyone keep an eye on your vitals.

-Copy that, Commander. -Copy.

Copy that, Commander.

Follow me.

Come on, guys, weâ€™re the first humans

to set foot on the far side of the moon.

Guys, weâ€™re a part of history no matter what now.

Stupid things!

Did you see that?

See what?

I donâ€™t know, it looked Cyrillic...

Russian, maybe.

Russian? Thatâ€™s odd.

If anything, we probably picked up

some Chinese characters from the Yutu-2.

No, no, no, it for sure wasnâ€™t that.

Let me see if I can get it pulled back up.

We have more important things to do.

Come on, can we finish this walkthrough?

Fine.

Well, Liam, it appears to be working.

Arenâ€™t you glad I came, Commander?

Okay, letâ€™s take what we need and head back.

The less of our oxygen reserves we use out here, the better.

Jackpot.

Oh, shoot.

What is it, Liam?

Bloody nose.

I hit my face pretty bad during the crash.

Liam, have Owen check you out the second we get back.

Captain, I think you should see this.

A volcanic reaction?

Unlikely...

nothing under the moon should cause ripples like that.

The moon has magma, but no active volcanoes.

Even if weâ€™re under a magma chamber, thereâ€™s no way.

Tracks?

From what, a giant moon snake?

The rover?

No, tire tread doesnâ€™t match.

Back to the ship, leave the rover!

What are those?

Sharks?

Why are there sharks on the moon?

Look, itâ€™s not moving.

I think someone must have set a trap.

Okay, but who set the trap?

Ah!

[speaks Russian]

How are they breathing?

Uh, I think they just spoke...

Russian?

First there were giant sharks, now there are Russians?

You think theyâ€™re friendly?

The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

Americans...

Welcome to the moon!

For the record, this was not in the brochure.

I didnâ€™t think it would be the Americans

who will lead my rescue operation, but how do you say...

beggars canâ€™t be choosers.

A rescue mission?

Who are you?

You werenâ€™t sent here to rescue me?

After 40 years on the moon,

I assumed somebody would want to bring me back!

[speaks Russian]

Papa, weâ€™re going to get you back home.

Donâ€™t give up hope.

What is the point?

Iâ€™m an old man, Iâ€™ve literally watched the world

pass me by more times than I can remember.

Maybe...

maybe itâ€™s time to assume...

actually, to accept that no one is coming.

Donâ€™t say that.

Yes, sheâ€™s right.

Weâ€™re more than happy to bring you back with us, both of you.

We just need to fix our ship first.

See, Papa? Weâ€™re going home.

What is up with her back?

Michael, stop. They just saved us.

Iâ€™m... Iâ€™m sorry.

Okay, let me officially introduce ourselves.

My name is Sergei, and this is Akula.

And sheâ€™s my daughter...

Adopted daughter.

Iâ€™m sorry, I...

No problem.

But hey, if you ever will try to touch my daughter again,

I will make the arrangement to send you back home

in a plastic bag, you understood?

Look, Iâ€™m sorry about my crewmate.

We can take you back to Earth with us,

but first we need to know who you really are,

and what youâ€™re doing here.

Thereâ€™s no time for it.

The hybrids can return any moment.

I have a rover just towards this ledge, letâ€™s go.

Good, I can guide you back to my ship.

Are you sure itâ€™s a good idea to have them

bring us to their ship?

We may be followed, and their ship

is our best bet to get off this stupid rock.

Mm.

Good looking forward.

Okay, change of the plans.

Now we go to our base and gather our supplies,

and when itâ€™s safe, we return to your ship

and figure out how we can get back to Earth.

Last I checked, I was the commander here.

I need to get back to my ship.

Well, we either all go to my ship

and wipe them off your trail, or we go separate ways.

They will follow you, find you,

kill you and every member of your crew.

Does it still sound like a good idea to you?

Fine, lead the way...

for now.

Quickly, get on. Theyâ€™re not far.

Iâ€™m sorry itâ€™s a tight fit, I wasnâ€™t expecting guests.

Okay, come on, guys, make some room.

Come on.

Ah!

Henri!

Hurry! Drive, we have to save him!

What are you waiting for, letâ€™s go!

They will lead us into a trap.

If they were going to kill him, they would have done so.

If theyâ€™re not gonna kill him, what are they doing?

Theyâ€™re taking him hostage.

I have to warn my crew.

No, you donâ€™t.

Get off me, I have to warn my crew!

Iâ€™m not gonna let them die!

If you donâ€™t want them to die,

then donâ€™t talk to them over the radio.

The electromagnetic waves will lead sharks

straight to your ship, and to your crew.

They wonâ€™t get a chance.

We have to save Henri.

Iâ€™m not leaving another member of my crew.

And we will, but going in there now, unprepared,

with what youâ€™re wearing, is a suicide mission.

We will get supplies at our base.

Whereâ€™s my helmet?

How can I breathe down here?

[speaks Russian]

Hey! Let me out of here!

I am Tzarina Selah.

Iâ€™m sure you have questions.

So do I.

Quickly, no time to lose.

Welcome to my abode.

Itâ€™ll take your body a minute to adjust to the oxygen

filling the ship from my algea crop.

You can take off your masks then.

So, now, we can talk.

Okay, I got one question.

How are you still alive?

Okay, I have some serious questions.

Why doesnâ€™t she need a suit?

Or oxygen?

I knew there was something "fishy" about her.

He was right.

Iâ€™m one of them.

Created to survive in all conditions.

Man, this day just keeps getting weirder and weirder.

Scouting an abandoned camp for supplies, I came across her.

She was absolutely healthy...

hungry, but healthy.

He saved my life, raised me as his own,

and taught me everything he knows.

I grew up listening to his homelandâ€™s music,

and reading the books of his people.

The ship had a fine audio system.

Thank God for Tchaikovsky,

"Swan Lake" was the only thing

that could put me to sleep as a child.

Have you heard of it?

Yes, weâ€™ve heard of "Swan Lake."

Itâ€™s a classic back on Earth.

But Iâ€™m actually a rock and roll guy, you know?

But I was not able to put my hands on it.

I even saw Elton in Moscow, in...

Wait, wait, you saw... you saw Elton John?

Yes, this thing was the best one, eh?

Can we get back on topic, please?

Okay, as much as her music taste,

Akula became better than me in many respects.

She even made some devices I wasnâ€™t able to survive without.

So, speaking of...

here, upgraded suits.

They were my prototype, but they still work.

They block body heat and electromagnetic frequencies,

rendering us invisible to them.

While keeping your own body heat

to protect you from the frigid moonâ€™s temperatures.

They also utilize an infrared communicator,

which converts sound to be undetectable.

And the oxygen?

Same like hybrids...

I convert my own.

So, they able to have it by consume algae they harvest,

and I able to extract it from the containers I grow them in.

So, thatâ€™s why my ship is full of oxygen,

and I put some on my back, you know, in my suit.

Like a makeshift oxygen tank.

Yes.

Impressive, but why are there hybrid sharks on the moon

in the first place?

Well, I was a very young scientist,

but always dreamed to become a cosmonaut.

"The great gig in the sky," I always told myself.

But we had a better and straight goal

from the government...

we have to declare the moon Soviet property.

You had just left your footprint on it,

and we were going to build cities.

So, our government created these sharks, these hybrids,

to become Cold War weapons against the United States.

So, my colleague and I lured them on the rocket

to make sure they wouldnâ€™t invade Earth.

But youâ€™re the only one here.

What happened to the other guy?

He sacrificed himself so that I could live.

Sergei, Iâ€™m so sorry.

How did you manage to survive so long?

Well, the ship was filled with experiments.

I was able to grow my own food,

collect evaporated water from plants,

and algae helped me to survive.

We found water, drilled underground.

Itâ€™s not very good, but we survive.

Look, I hate to break up this Q and A,

but a man is being tortured by giant shark people.

Michaelâ€™s right, every second weâ€™re here

is a second weâ€™re not saving Henri.

Where did they take him?

The hybrids developed a settlement

inside the largest crater in the area.

Heâ€™s likely being held there.

We need to get there now.

Henriâ€™s our mechanic.

We canâ€™t repair the ship without him.

Letâ€™s boogie.

The sharks are probably off our trail by now.

We need to try and communicate with the ship.

We need to warn the crew at all costs.

They need to avoid using anything electromagnetic.

I think youâ€™re right.

Donâ€™t let them see me.

Hey, you saw Elton John?

Man, Iâ€™ve been trying, never got a chance to.

Ellie.

Ellie, if you can hear this, do not respond...

I repeat, do not respond.

The ship is in danger of being attacked.

Any luck restoring electricity to the ship?

Not yet.

I repeat, do not respond using anything electromagnetic.

It could draw them to the ship for an attack.

Come in... Commander? Commander Tress!

-Itâ€™s not safe. -Nicole!

What was that?

I donâ€™t know.

What could be taking them so long?

It sounded like she was in trouble.

We have to go out after them.

What? No, no, no.

We were given explicit orders to remain on the ship.

Nicole put me in charge.

They should have been back by now, theyâ€™re not responding.

What if theyâ€™re hurt?

I need you to grab your medical gear and come with me.

-But... -No buts!

Josie, Tom, continue running diagnostics.

Owen, we have a crew to find.

Ah... I swear, I donâ€™t know where the ship is!

The crash took us so far off-course, I... I...

I just want your ship.

You and your crew can have everything we leave behind.

Build your little colony in peace.

We are going home.

Home?

Yes, the mother planet to us both. Earth.

Wait, wait, wait... youâ€™re from Earth?

Yes, I will rule there as I rule here.

Now tell me... where is your ship?

I... I canâ€™t tell you.

Thatâ€™s a shame. Scar!

Ah, my leg, ah!

Ah!


Now tell us, or die!

Okay. Okay. But you have to...

you have to promise me...

promise me you wonâ€™t hurt my crew.

On my honor as Tzarina, ruler of the Hybrid sharks.

Scar, prepare the guards Weâ€™re taking the ship.


Ah!

Heh, if Elton John could see me now, right?

Yeah, youâ€™re a rocket man now.

What... what are these made of?

Sharpened moonstone...

the only thing sharp enough to pierce the sharksâ€™ hides.

This stone has more crystalline structure,

and itâ€™s hold sharp edge for extremely long time.

You two really have thought of everything, havenâ€™t you?

When the alternative is death, you do what you can.

Okay, from now, weâ€™d better go forward on foot.

We donâ€™t want to let them know weâ€™re coming.

Akula, lead the way.

Itâ€™s clear. This way... stay close.

Hey, Iâ€™ve been meaning to ask you about

the booby trap you set when we met.

What about it?

I couldnâ€™t help but notice that the hybrid shark,

when it was on its back, it stopped moving.

Why is that?

Tonic immobility...

when a shark is upside-down,

it cannot move,

and itâ€™s about the only thing what can stop them.

And how many sharks are out there, dozens, hundreds?

A few dozen.

Their leader, Tzarina Selah,

only allows the very strongest to hatch.

But even with her rules, automatic parthenogenesis

asexual reproduction, started to happen.

Nature finds a way.

And how do they just pick a few to survive?

Do they just let the weak ones die?

All the eggs are cryogenically frozen in the hopes

that they one day will have enough resources

to hatch them all.

The ones that are allowed to be born,

the best and the strongest,

are trying to protect the crater.

No wonder you werenâ€™t chosen.

Everyone makes mistakes.

Now, quiet.

They can hear us.

Wow... they built a whole civilization.

Impressive, if they werenâ€™t so terrifying.

Who would have thought sharks

would have colonized the moon before humans?

Half-shark, half-human.

All teeth?

All violence... donâ€™t forget that.

Enough.

Akula, where do we need to go to get into the prison?

The other side of that large building.

They donâ€™t have heavy patrols there,

they guard the front entrance.

If we go in through the back, we should have a clear shot.

You heard her.

Letâ€™s dance.


Follow me, and donâ€™t get any blood on you.

Look what they were able to accomplish

in only a few decades.

Yeah, itâ€™s impressive, all right.

Too bad theyâ€™re all bloodthirsty killers

who would rip your throat out if given the chance.

Of course, just makes me wish we had the chance

to actually do the mission we came here to do.

Well, if they could, we sure can.

These shark hybrids have only expansion

and aggressions in mind.

They never leave their guards down...

stay alert.

I donâ€™t like this.

Something feels wrong.

We have to try.

These footprints are the only signs of them.

Nicole would do the same for us.

I guess.

Itâ€™s just spooky out here, on the far side.

Whatâ€™s that?

What?

I donâ€™t know, it looks...

it looks like a piece of fabric,

maybe from one of the spacesuits.

Oh, my God...

Liam.

And whereâ€™s Nicole, Michael, Henri?

Come in, Commander, Michael, Henri, anybody...

we have a casualty!

Back to the ship... now!

What do you think got Liam?

Thereâ€™s nothing living on the moon!

Owen, you cut out for a second...

Owen?

Owen!

Owen!

Help!



All right, if I take our location

in conjunction with the moonâ€™s rotation...

there, we have our way home.

But...

But? But what?

We have to get this bucket of bolts off the ground

and headed back to Earth in less than six hours.

If we donâ€™t, itâ€™s another four weeks till the next window.

See if you can get in touch with Nicole.

Maybe sheâ€™s with Ellie by now.

Commander Tress, this is Tom.

Come in, Commander.

You and the crew need to get back to the ship ASAP.

We only have a six-hour window to get home.

Commander Tress, come in.

Nicole?

Ellie?

Is anybody out there?

If we get attacked, remember one rule...

if we draw blood, we draw attention.

But weâ€™ve been cutting sharks all day.

Exactly... out there, where there is no atmosphere.

But here, they can smell anything.

And boy, they do love smell of blood.

God, itâ€™s hot in here.

Itâ€™s safe to take it off.

They hold prisoners at the back end of this building.

We have to be careful not to alert any patrols.

Should we take â€™em down?

We have to avoid any conflicts.

Weâ€™re on hybrids territory now.

Looks like the hallway splits up ahead.

Weâ€™ll take the left, you guys go right.

Move out.

The sooner we can get Henri back to our ship,

the sooner we can get out of here for good.

What do I do?

We only have one shot at this.

Follow my lead and take the low road.

-What? -Trust me!

Swing!

Lunge!

Stop!

We wanna keep him alive?

We draw blood, we draw attention, remember?

[speaking Russian]

He drew blood to alert the guards.

I knew we should have killed him.

We have to get out of here, go.

-Go, go, go! -Go, go, go!

Canâ€™t risk it.

We found Henri!

Henri, oh, my God.

Iâ€™m sorry, I...

I tried my best, but I just...

The ship, itâ€™s not safe.

What are you talking about?

The sharks, theyâ€™re gonna use the ship to get back to Earth.

They have an army of eggs that theyâ€™re gonna hatch there.

Earth has all the resources they need

to become the dominant species.

Why wouldnâ€™t they just use your ship?

Well, my ship is barely big enough

just for Akula and myself.

We donâ€™t have enough fuel to reach Earth,

and we operate off the Cold War time technology.

So, there is no way to plot a course.

What about your ship?

We have to get back, now.

Michael, help Henri up.

Letâ€™s get outta here.


Come on, this way.

Hurry!

Quick! In here. Theyâ€™re running the other way.

What are these?

Uh, guys?

These are hybrid shark eggs.

This must be their incubation chamber.

There are so many.

Earth would never stand a chance.

We should destroy them now.

No!

Those are innocent children.

They havenâ€™t done anything wrong.

Children?

Those are monsters, killing machines.

From what I heard about humans, theyâ€™re not better.

Should we kill all the humans, too?

If we stop them now,

we can prevent an invasion from ever happening.

Those things have millions of soldiers stockpiled,

ready to attack at any minute.

If we destroy them now,

itâ€™ll take them decades to recover, if they ever do.

Theyâ€™re sounding an alarm!

Weâ€™ve lingered here too long.

We have to get out of here, now!

Go, hurry!

Move slowly and quietly. The sharks know weâ€™re here now.

Magnificent. Just like you and me... sister.

No...

donâ€™t group me in with your kind, Selah.

From the moment I was born,

it was made very clear to me that Iâ€™m not one of you.

Where is Akula?

Akula?

Akula!

They abandoned me, and you did nothing.

I spared your life!

They wanted to kill you, but I wouldnâ€™t let them.

I knew the human would take you in.

Weak, predictable humans.

My human has shown me more kindness

from the very beginning than any hybrid ever has.

Think, Akula.

You are the link between human and shark.

I knew it then and I know it now.

We need you.

That changes nothing.

I know all about your plans.

We are returning home. To where we belong.

Not if youâ€™re going to kill off humanity.

I wonâ€™t let you.

You can watch from here or you...

we could finally go home.

[speaking Russian]

Donâ€™t scare me like that again!

Where have you been?

I heard something.

Could we steal one of the sharksâ€™ rovers

outside the building?

Yes, we have to get out of here.

Perfect. Henri?

All good, Commander.

We donâ€™t have time for this.

Michael!

Itâ€™s either us or them.

Get out! Get out!

Commander...

Commander Tress, can you hear me?

Itâ€™s no use, Tom.

We need to keep working until someone gets back.

I hate feeling so helpless.

Me too, but we have our plants,

Liamâ€™s experiments, and our back-up oxygen reserves.

We could survive for months if we need to.

Yeah, youâ€™re right.

Well, letâ€™s just...

-[clanging] -Oh!

What was that?

-The habitation chamber, hurry! -Go, go, go.

Those look like shark teeth.

Sharks on the moon... thatâ€™s what that was, yeah?

Whatever it is, we cannot let it destroy

the life support systems, weâ€™ll never make it back if they do.

-Ah! -Josie!

Which way to the rovers?

Those were children... babies.

I did what I had to to survive.

I saved our asses.

And itâ€™s not like I killed all of them,

just a drop in the bucket.

Enough! We have to move.

Theyâ€™ll be on us any second.

We have to stick together or die alone, got it?

Akula, lead the way.

Get in.

We gotta lose him.

Hold on!

Uh, heâ€™s still there.

Take him out.

My pleasure.

Nice shot.

It will be back... that wasnâ€™t a kill shot.

But you bought us precious time.

All we need, just keep moving.

Thatâ€™s an infrared communication device,

same weâ€™ve got in our suits.

Ellie? Tom?

Josie? Owen? Can anybody hear me?

This is Commander Nicole Tress.

If anyone can hear me,

we got aggressive company coming in hot.

Do what you can to arm the ship.

You must keep it safe.

I repeat, protect the ship at all costs.

All right, everyone, keep an eye out...

we donâ€™t want any more surprises, got it?

Everyone inside, hurry.

Weâ€™re too late.

Come on, we gotta help them.

How many were inside?

Four.

Where is everyone?

No bodies and no blood.

We need to go room to room

and see if we can find any of your people.

Akula, stay by me.

What happened here?


Oh! Nicole!

-Youâ€™re back! -Josie! Tom!

Whereâ€™s everyone else?

Theyâ€™re not with you?

They went looking for you hours ago, and weâ€™ve had no word.

Liam as well.

We think thereâ€™s some sharks still out there,

just not sure where.

They are sharks, right?

Yes, and thatâ€™s why we need to make sure

we have everything armed against them.

Hold on, wait...

who are they?

What are you wearing,

And why doesnâ€™t she have oxygen?

Weâ€™ll explain everything later.

Thatâ€™s Sergei, thatâ€™s Akula,

and the only thing you need to know right now

is we need to get back to Earth now,

with these two as part of the crew.

Good, I plotted us a course home,

but we only have four hours and 15 minute window.

If we repair breaches in the hull,

we can use some of our spare oxygen tanks as...

well, as the algae-based biofuel Iâ€™ve been working on

to jump-start the ship.

Great, the sooner we get off this rock, the better.

Henri, do you think you can help Tom?

Oh, my God, Henri, what happened?

Thatâ€™s how they were able to find the ship.

They tortured me.

What? You did what?

Stop!

Josie, you tell Sergei what else you need.

Akula, you come with us to the command module

to help Tom and Henri.

First, we need to repair the entrance.

And I will not let Akula to be out of my sight again.

If Nicole needs my help to get off the moon,

then you need to let me come with her.


Theyâ€™re back!

How many are there?

Ten, 20... a lot.

There are too many of them.

And this... just a stupid baby.

There is no way we can kill them fast enough with our harpoons.

We need a new plan.

Iâ€™ve got this.

-Henri, no! -Thatâ€™s too dangerous!

You have plenty of capable people here

that can repair the ship.

Josie and Tom figured out a way home,

Akula and Sergei have been stuck here for 40 years,

and all I did was give up the location.

Now Iâ€™m gonna fix it.

What is he doing?

Saving your asses... and no oneâ€™s gonna stop me.

-My mindâ€™s already made up. -Wait...

Iâ€™m the commander, I should be doing this

Thatâ€™s exactly what you need to do, Commander... command.

No, let him go.

Heâ€™s the reason why weâ€™re in this mess.

You can barely stand on one foot.

The sharks were gonna find us no matter what.

No, theyâ€™re right.

Iâ€™ll draw them away from the ship

and then Iâ€™ll take care of them.

Hopefully, Iâ€™ll be able to give them the slip,

and then together, we can get home.

If we return, I will make sure you receive

the highest possible commendations.

When we get home, Commander.

All right, everyone, take cover.

Ah!

Die, you son of a bitch!

All clear.

Henriâ€™s sacrifice wonâ€™t be forgotten.

All right, team, we have work to do.

Tom?

Yeah.

Seal off this section, plot us a course home.

Iâ€™ll take care of the breach.

Akula.

Roger that, Commander.

Follow me.

Adjusting for our new weight,

using the moonâ€™s gravitational pull to our advantage,

I think we can pull this off.

Our flight path is clear, but...

But what?

We have less time than I thought.

How much time we talking?

Twenty-four minutes and 37 seconds.

You said we had four hours!

I forgot to adjust the amount of force required

to get us to the speed to successfully

fling us to the near side.

Our initial launch didnâ€™t account for us

being on the far side.

I just fixed the hull breach.

Letâ€™s everyone be ready so we can hit that window.

Letâ€™s move.

More sharks will be showing up any second.

Oh, no.

What? What is it?

Theyâ€™re here.

Theyâ€™re loading up the eggs!

Theyâ€™re boarding the ship.

Who is that?

Thatâ€™s Tzarina Selah. Sheâ€™s their leader.


We still need to seal the interior hull

before we can take off.

Youâ€™re not wearing protective suits.

They can detect your electromagnetic signature.

Stay near electronics... theyâ€™ll go after you first.

I need to download the flight plan onto my drive.

We canâ€™t let them have it.

We have to hold on to that.


We canâ€™t risk it, we need everyone alive.

Find a place to hide, and attack only when necessary.

Everyone hide, now!

Ah!

Come on, come on...

Got it!

Oh, shit.

Tom...

Ah!

Youâ€™re a freak of nature, you know that?

Do your worst.

Stop!

We surrender.

Akula, sister.

You should have taken me up on my offer.

After all, none of this could have happened without your help.

What offer? What help?

How do you think we learned how to fly a ship?

When you were out hunting us,

we sent some hybrids to break into your ship

and learn everything they could.

I didnâ€™t know, Papa.

I had no idea.

Donâ€™t be modest.

Now you have a chance to live among your real family

and be a leader of our people on Earth.

Is it true?

She offered it, yes,

but I never considered it, not for a moment.

Sharks are not my family.

They left me for dead.

You are my family.

Exactly why we abandoned you near his ship to begin with.

Our plan was executed perfectly. All thanks to you.

I swear, I didnâ€™t know, Papa.

You believe me, right?

I trust you.

Sheâ€™s my daughter.

I trust her with my life.

Selah, itâ€™s not too late.

You could continue your good work here.

We can go back to Earth and return with supplies.

You could grow and thrive.

Just let us go.

Humans made you...

we can help you.

Iâ€™d rather take Earth for my own.

Weâ€™re leaving... now.

We need to get off this ship.

Guards donâ€™t speak English.

I donâ€™t think we can trust her anymore.

What more does she have to do?

Sheâ€™s saved your ass more times today than I can count.

Sheâ€™s proven herself to be worth not only our trust,

but our respect.

I believe you.

Thank you.

I believe you, too.

I suppose if youâ€™re in here with us, youâ€™re one of us.

So, weâ€™re good?

Sure.

Okay, maybe thereâ€™s a way out of here.

If we can get out, maybe thereâ€™s something on your ship.

No, thereâ€™s...

Oh, my God, theyâ€™re gonna torture us.

Not without a fight, they arenâ€™t.

Gotcha.


Henri!

Ah!

Tomâ€™s USB.

The flight plans!

If we can get this back to your ship, Sergei,

we can use this to get back

and warn Earth that the sharks arenâ€™t to be trusted.

We could fight!

There!

Depressurizing.

Theyâ€™ll be here any second, hurry!

It looks to be about 50 feet down.

Itâ€™s only gonna get further,

and gravityâ€™s gonna slow you down, now, go!

One at a time to be safe.

Come on, hurry!

Iâ€™ll go first, so I can catch you when you land.

Iâ€™m not a kid anymore.

I will not let you to be hurt.

Wait for my command!

Akula, jump!

Warning, hatch breach in Module Four.

Warning, hatch breach in Module Four.

-You next. -No, you!

Stop!

-Change of plans. -Ah!


Where is Akula?

Are you all right, boss?

Yeah, Iâ€™m fine.

[speaking Russian]

I wish I could take credit.

Scar...

But it was a human that killed your precious bodyguard.

Itâ€™s Akula...

and something else.

Akula.

Is that the tzarina?

It was.

Pretty sure she got some brain damage, or worse.

Guys...

My ship is not far away... run!

Over here!

Iâ€™ve set up a perimeter of booby traps

that will help slow them down.

There is a way we can destroy the rest of the sharks,

and maybe, if we are lucky,

we can destroy their ship before it gets too far.

Out with it!

What? What is it?

The nitrogen-enriched soil I use to grow crops

can be used to make an explosion.

I canâ€™t believe that I didnâ€™t think of this sooner.

There is no bomb that you can make that will reach the sharks.

Yes, but I can make the ones

that would aggravate the magma under the moonâ€™s surface.

I can fly my rocket straight into the center.

Itâ€™s the only way.

But youâ€™ll die!

Anything will be wiped out on the surface within 50 miles.

Including us.

The geo-thermal disturbance will create tidal waves of lava

that will spread easily over 50 miles.

Looks like theyâ€™re flanking us, we have to move... run.

Thatâ€™s not going to hold long.

She doesnâ€™t have much,

but controls still working, engine runs.

And we just have enough fuel for one shot.

I can do it all by myself, but I need you buy me some time.

There has to be a better way.

We donâ€™t have time.

Theyâ€™re already here.

Sergei, no!

Iâ€™ll stay with you, Iâ€™ll...

Akula, my sweet daughter,

my dearest daughter,

Iâ€™m finally ready to do something by myself.

I need you to go with Nicole and Michael,

and keep the hybrids off my back so we can destroy them.

You are the best fighter I know.

You can do it.

Spasiba, Papa.

[speaks Russian]

Keep it with you.

Iâ€™ve always saved it for the long time,

while we land in the sea.

Keep it on you.

When you land, it will do the job.

Trust me... it will do the job.

Now, go.

Please keep them off my back so we can break theirs.

Go!

You ready?

Ready?

Who could be?

Well, too bad.

Ha!

Ah!


[rock n roll music plays]

Okay, old lady...

show me what youâ€™ve got.


-Thanks. -Youâ€™re welcome.

Keep fighting, letâ€™s go!

Ha!

Ah!

[speaking Russian]


What on Earth?

Exactly!

Earth!

Weâ€™re here!

I canâ€™t believe weâ€™re here!

Papa was right... weâ€™re home, thanks to Papa.

Weâ€™ll make sure his sacrifice is not forgotten.

Papa described Earth to me, and he was right.

He said it would eclipse all of my wildest imagination.

Oh, itâ€™s beautiful, Papa!

It really is.

Iâ€™m never gonna take it for granted again.

We need to figure out how to get back.

Maybe wait till dark, plot a detailed course with the stars.

Oh, it hurts...

oh, it really, really hurts, ugh!

Akula! Where does it hurt?

Itâ€™s coming in waves!

All right, just breathe, deep breaths.

[heavy breathing]

Akula, did you maybe have any sort of...

relationship with any of the shark hybrids?

What? No!

Ah!

Akula, I think youâ€™re pregnant.

What?

How is it possible?

Automatic parthenogenesis?

Sergei mentioned it happening to the other sharks.

Akula, push!


Itâ€™s... itâ€™s adorable!

Oh, great... now we have another mouth to feed.

Ah!

Son of a bitch, these teeth are sharp!

Nicole, Iâ€™ve got to take care of my babies!

Akula!

Akula! Akula!

Weâ€™re so fu--
