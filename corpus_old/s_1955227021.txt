[Music playing]

Amazing, isn't it?

Interesting.

Let me show you around.

[Music playing]

You know, this place
was built in 1929.

Al Capone used to stay there.

[Pager beeping]

Oh, I'm sorry.

Oh, I've got to call
this phone number.

It... it's another
estate I'm closing on.

Here, use the car phone.

Oh, you don't mind?

No, not at all.

Thanks.

I'll be right back.

I'll just walk around.

Great.

Oh, hey, Brandy, don't forget
to push End when you're done.

[Music playing]

Well, this might work.

Hi.

How you doing?

You must be Rutherford.

Brandy told me you'd be by.

Nice to meet you.

Jack Devlin is the name.

Care taking is the game.

Oh.

I hear you might be
interested in buying a place.

Maybe, yeah.

Well, it's really well built.
Little bit of water damage,

But, uh...

But... but what?

Oh, well, that old house
has quite a history.

Well, uh, what
do you mean, Jack?

Well, for starters, you ever
hear of Hubert Whitehead?

Never heard of him.

Who was he?

Hubert Whitehead killed
six college students

When it was Spencer
House, a private college.

That was in 1969,
a time of love,

Peace, and the 429 Thunder Jet.


REPORTER: Ladies and
gentlemen, we are here

At the site of the Gold Coast
Correctional Institution,

Anticipating the imminent
release of Hubert Whitehead,

Convicted mass murderer of
the grisly killings at Spencer

House College 22 years ago.

It is an eerie sight
for this reporter

As Hubert makes his way toward
the gate, as, of course,

I covered it 22
years ago and have

Been released from the studio
for this momentous occurrence.

This is the first
time in state history

That a convicted mass
murderer has been paroled.

[Music playing]


Bastard.

Spencer House party.

Geeks, stay out.

Goddamn it, Hubert!

Are you nuts, bringing
a gun in here?



Hubert, please,
please don't hurt us!

I really liked your Thunderbird
with the 429 Thunder Jet

Engine!

Yeah, Hubert, really.

I think your car is really boss.


No.

No!
Yes!

WOMAN: No!


Help!

[Gun clicking]

HUBERT: Shit!

Dammit!

MAN: No!
HUBERT: Yes!

MAN: No!

HUBERT: Yeah!

MAN: No!


Party's over!


Come on.

Hey.

Are we up?

OK.

All right.

We're rolling?

Uh.

Behind me is the dormitory
at Spencer House College.

Shortly after 9:45
this evening, a gunman

Entered one of the
dormitories here

And opened fire on
several of the students.

It's been reported that four
students have been murdered

And two others
critically wounded

And not expected to survive.

Uh, police have no leads at
this time as to the gunman is.

Back to you in the studio.

REPORTER: And we now see him
making his way to the gate.

Yes, we now see Hubert Whitehead
being released from prison.

Uh, he's now coming
through the gate.

The man embracing him
is Jim Flowers, head

Of the White Doves of Peace.

Mr. Whitehead, please, uh, a
couple of questions, if I may.

Now that you've been released
from prison after 22 years,

Do you feel the penal
system become more lenient?

Well, as you, it has become
a kinder and gentler nation.


Uh, yes, please, any
other questions I may...

After 22 years of
injustice under a fascist

Judicial system,
Mr. Whitehead has

Been released in our custody.

We now plan on taking
him to his new home,

And we'll work to
secure a job for him

So he can become a
productive citizen.

WOMAN: You son of a bitch!

Hubert!

You murdered my baby!

JIM: Hubert...
Hubert... outta here!

Ladies and gentlemen, a
protester wielding a gun

Has just been tackled
by a police officer.

Hubert Whitehead and Jim
Flowers from the White

Doves of Peace and the probation
team have sped away in the car.

[Woman sobbing]

Car.

Hello.

Belong to you?

Golly.

No, he don't.

I can't believe it.

Yeah, well, it's here.
You're good, buddy.

Hard to believe.

You're here.

Home, sweet home, huh?

Hubert, I need to
talk to you, buddy.

Yeah?

Listen, before
your parents died,

All their money went
toward legal fees

To try to secure your release.

Mm-hmm.

However, they did leave you
this old house and this old car

Over here under the canvas.

Now, it's not much, Hubert,
but it's a start for you.

Jim, you've been a real
friend to me over these years,

And I promise you, I
won't let you know.

I know.
I'll...

I know you won't.

I know you won't, Hubert.

I know you won't.

Yeah, let me give you the keys
to the car and the house, OK?

And we'll be back in the
morning to take you job hunting.

Jim, thank you.

Thank you.
OK, buddy.

Thank you.
You're very welcome.

Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

You're welcome, Hubert.

Thank you.

Take care, buddy.

You take care of yourself.

So long.

Bye.


Well, Betty, 22
years I've waited

For this day, 22 years of
combing your hair in my cell.

Now we're both free.

Hey, Connie, come on over
here and look at my new T-bird!

It's got a four-barrel 429
Thunder Jet engine in it.

It's got dual exhaust.

I bought it today,
and it's all mine.

Do yourself a favor.

Come on over to the dorm
party in it with me tonight.

Hubert, I don't
care if you do have

A brand new Thunderbird with a
429 Thunder Jet engine in it.

I wouldn't go out with you if
you were the last boy on Earth,

You worm.

Yeah, you geek.


[Music playing]

Oh, Hubert, no.

He was pretty gross.

I mean, he was a real geek.

He rubbed up against
me a couple times.

Gave me the creeps.

I hated him.


Hubert?

What a geek, man.

He's so weird.

We used to bounce
basketballs off his head.

We never thought he'd do
something crazy like that,

Though, kill all those people.


Man, Hubert?

You had to do what
you had to do, man.

Cool.

Peace.


MAN: Hubert, Hubert,
Hubert, Hubert, Hubert.

MULTIPLE VOICES (SINGING):
It's time to come

Back to Spencer House College.

What are we gonna
do with that guy?

I've been watching this guy
for two hours, washing that car.

Well, you're gonna
have to get rid of him.

That... that guy's weird.

He just got outta the joint.

Why don't you gove over
there and see about it?

Come on.
Go see.

Belongs to the
guy with the suit.

Check him out.

You sure you want
me to go over there?

Yeah.

You gotta do something, Rob.

MAN: He's dangerous.

Go on!

You take care of it.

Man, I've been watching
you for a couple of hours.

You're doing a pretty
good job on this old car.

You going some place?

Yeah.

I'm going back to college.

You're going back to college?

Here.

Take good care of Betty for me.

Go on with that.

Go on.

MAN: -Oh, you don't
want that, Shirley?

MAN 2: No, go on, go on.

That's what he give me.


MAN 2: You gonna be in
the same shape he's in.

NEIGHBOR: You don't want this?
MAN 2: Hell, no.

I ain't... I ain't
drunk enough yet.

Bullshit.

MAN: Hubert.

MAN 2: Hubert.

Shut up!

This is bullshit.

Still smells like
rat shit in here.


I closed you bastards down,
you [inaudible] bastards.

Me, Hubert Whitehead!


Wonder what's going on up there?

No more parties
in the dorm room!


College, we love you.

To thy colors
we'll e'er be true.

Spencer College, fuck you
too, dear old Spencer College.


College, we love you.

To thy colors
we'll e'er be true.

To thy colors
we'll e'er be true.

Fuck you, Spencer College!

Spencer College, we love you.

Fuck you, Spencer College!


Where is everyone?

School hasn't started yet.

Registration should
have started weeks ago.

Oh, I know.

I know.

I closed them down.

Me, Hubert Whitehead.


VOICE: Gonna pay.

Shut up!


Yeah.

I wasted a freak here,
stabbed an egg head here.


VOICE: Hubert.

Shut up!

Hubert!

Hubert!

Hubert!

Hubert!

What's going on?

VOICE: Hubert!

This is crazy!


Why hasn't school started yet?

VOICE: Hubert Whitehead.

Welcome back, Hubert.

Goddamn it, Hubert.

Are you nuts, bringing
a gun in here?

Remember me?

I'm Brad Aldridge,
the star quarterback

Of the football team.

I never made it to
the pros because you

Shot me at point blank
range in the forehead,

And I died instantly.

Hello, Hubert.

I'm Pamela Sue Pierson.

Remember me?

I was head of the drama club,
but I never made it to Broadway

Because you put a
bullet in my liver,

And I lived in sheer
torture for five minutes.

Hello, Hubert, you worm.

Remember me?

Connie Firestone, your dream
girl from the Tasty Freeze.

I planned on getting
married to a nice guy,

Not a creep like you, and
having a couple of kids.

But even though Susan and I
begged and pleaded that you

Spare us, you went
ahead and put a bullet

Through my beautiful face.

And as I bent over gasping for
air, you never stopped firing.

You put another
bullet in my head.

And right before I passed
out, I lived long enough

To see you put your
gun in Susan's mouth

And blow the back
of her head off.

Hi, Hubert.

You never knew me.

I'm Jay Beardsley.

I was president of
the science club

And planned on becoming
a nuclear physicist.

That night when you shot
Brad and Pamela Sue,

I tried hiding from
you underneath the bed,

But you violently ripped
the bed back and stabbed

Me 40 times with a blue marlin.

You will never know the
pain that that big fish

Inflicted on me.

You shot me in
the back, you wimp.


Why don't you come back?

What do you want from me?

Why, Hubert, we want
you to party with us!


This game is called
quarters, Hubert.

Of course, you were too much of
a geek in college to play it,

So I'm gonna explain
the rules to ya.

First, you take a shot glass.

You fill it with beer.

Then you take a quarter, and
you clink it off the table

Into a shot glass.

If you make it in, then you
get to choose any person

At the table you want to drink.

But if you miss, then
you have to drink.

Oh, and we've changed
the rules a little.

Gun!

How'd you get a...

BRAD: If you miss, instead of
drinking, you'll be shot by me.

And I can choose anywhere
I want on your body.

HUBERT: Oh, my God.

So go ahead, Hubert.

Zap on it.

Oh, God.

Pamela Sue?


Jake?



Stop, please!

Stop!

Oh, don't be a party pooper!

Hubert, try again.

Oh, it hurts!

Oh, have mercy, Brad.

Have mercy.

BRAD: Have mercy?

Oh, that's a good one, Hubert.


Oh, of course it was!

Now you know how it
feels to have a bullet

Rip through your insides.

Continue with the game!


Ow!

How can I continue?

I can't even lift my arm.

Pick the quarter up in your
mouth and drop it off the table

Into the shot glass.

No, Brad, I can't do this.

Pamela Sue!

Sue!

Connie!



That's too bad, Hubert.

It seems you don't
have any arms left.

No!

No!

No!

No!

It's them!

I told you, it's the zombie!

They're killing me!

They're trying to kill me!

They already shot me five times.

Help me!

Help me!

Help me!

FEMALE REPORTER: Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.

The top news story at this
hour... police and paramedics

Were just called to the campus
of the now-defunct Spencer

House College by Jim Flowers,
leader of the White Doves

Of Peace, and a
probation officer

After they found paroled
mass murder Hubert Whitehead

Screaming and
babbling about being

Shot in the very room he
went on a shooting rampage

22 years ago.

There were no signs
of shots being fired,

Nor anyone being there,
except Whitehead.

Good story, Jack, but
whatever happened to Hubert?

Oh, he's locked up in
some padded cell someplace.

So let me get this straight.

Are you saying this
place has ghosts?

Uh-huh.

And then there was
the Davis family.

Oh, that was quite a story.

RUTHERFORD: Who?

Oh, well, you don't
wanna hear about that one.

RUTHERFORD: Well, why not, Jack?

Because you
wouldn't believe it.

Try me.

Vampires.

Vampires?

Did I hear you right?

Vampires.


Shit!

Why don't you let me try?

Because you'll never hit it.

Yeah, only because
you won't let me try.

Shut up.

JAMIE: I can hit it.

Get outta here.
You're a girl.

You can't shoot a gun.

Just because I'm a girl
has nothing to do with it.

All right, Jamie.

What?

Are you kidding me?

No way, man.

Uh-uh.

I'm next.

You know how to use this?

I think so.

TIM: OK.

Prop this up on your shoulder.

Take off the safety,
and you're all set.

Great shot, Jamie.

TIM: Yeah, terrific shot, Jamie.

Hi, Tim.

Hi, Laurie.

Hi, Tim.

Hi, Laurie.

Yeah.

You two make me sick.

Come on, Jamie.

Let's see if we can get inside.

Are you coming?

It was as if Timmy
truly believed

That '50s horror
film quote, "a family"

That slays together
stays together."

TOM: Are you coming?

I'm going to check upstairs.

Wait a minute!

Tom!

ADULT JAMIE

We doing in that old
house, a place where we

Played every summer for years?

You didn't have to
be clairvoyant to see

That our family was changing,
even though none of us

Realized it at the time.

It was obvious that
Timmy, the oldest,

Had discovered that I wasn't
the only girl in the world.

The time had come for
him to begin thinking

With another part
of his body, and he

Wasn't thinking of me or Tommy.

Tommy, tired of being in
his older brother's shadow,

Was finding strength to
fight his way out of it.

Unfortunately, he found most
of that strength battling

My parents, his
teachers, and the police,

Not necessarily in that order.

Sergeant Booker threatened
that one more prank,

And he was going to
put Tommy away forever.

My brother walked
right up to him

And said "you'll never take
me alive" with such conviction

That we almost believed him.

I was just becoming aware of
my gift, my gift of sight.

Down the hall... it
called me down the hall.

I could see things, things
without them being there.

Sometimes I'd see things
happening at the same time

In another part of town.

Other times, I felt that I
could almost see the future,

But I never got the
full picture, only

Pieces... pieces of the whole.

They'd come in flashes.

Sometimes, they'd
come in dreams.

If I told my brothers
about the gift,

They would have said that
I only had pieces of brain,

May have convinced
Sergeant Booker that I was

The one to be put away forever.

So I kept quiet, but
the piece that flashed

Before me now was a book.

There's a book in the cellar.

Down the cellar
stairs... find it.

It's there.

Part of me said
run, even as I began

This twisted descent down.

Did I see those things?

What was really calling me?

A comic book?

A simple comic book whose
subject would cause our

Lives to change wildly
out of control forever.

WOMAN: Jamie!

Who's there?

Help me!

My ankle is sprained.

I can't make it up the stairs.

Step into the light
so I can see you.

I can't move.

Please help me.

I don't believe you.

You're afraid of the
light, aren't you?

WOMAN: I told you to come here!

Tim, stop it!

What's the matter?

It's getting late.

I have to go.

Oh, come on.
No!


Not that late.

OK!
OK, OK.

All right.

I'll come back later when
my parents have gone to bed,

At midnight.

Oh, you mean a,
uh, midnight dinner?

ADULT JAMIE (VOICEOVER):
It was a summer of sneaking

Out the bedroom window.

Timmy's teenage desires
required something other

Than a good night's sleep.

It was a case of the
hot-to-trots gone mad.

Unfortunately, midnight
passion needs a bit more

Than a flat beer
in a tall boy can

And a stand-up
date's empty promise.

His lust turned to anger.

Then, he saw her dancing,
dancing to some unheard

Music for his audience of one.

Her slow, sultry
movements perfectly match

His internal pubescent rhythms.

Strong, pulsating,
desiring... his body

Wanted her more than his
teenage mind could understand.

In seconds, she
became the object

Of his every desire,
the perfect woman

To ignite the hot loins
of his youthful passion.

She was the midnight date
of his darkest dream.

His eyes drank in her every
curve, her every move,

Her every motion.

Her slow, undulating sexuality
sent ripples of desire

Throughout him.

With every surge of her
body, he felt closer to her.

He wanted to be deep
inside her, sharing

Her pleasure and ecstasy.

Her slow, sensuous
rocking seemed

Like ritualistic foreplay,
a pagan dance of desire

That she was using to
prepare herself for him.

He knew.

He knew that she wanted him
as much as he wanted her.

Not knowing exactly
what to do, but knowing

Exactly what he wanted, he
followed her down the hall.

Questions like
who was this woman

And what was she
doing in this house

Never entered his mind
as he followed her scent.

[Music playing]

He was entering the
domain of sweating,

Moving, open-mouthed bodies
filled with sexual desires that

Could only be
fulfilled by reaching

A screaming mutual climax that
left no one wanting for more.

He was about to become a man.

Hello.

I'm Diane.

I've been watching you.

Why?

Yes, that's right.

You know why.

I can't do this.

This is what you
want, isn't it?

ADULT JAMIE

Could actually sense
the quick, pulsing speed

Of his beating heart.

The gift swept me into the room.

I could clearly see
my brother's face.


All right, kid.

Where's your brother?

I told you already.

I don't know where he is.

I ran all you punks off from
the Spencer House yesterday.

Tom was with you.

What happened to him?

I don't know what
happened to him.

Did he go back
there to meet Lauren?

I have no idea.

I don't know.

MR. DAVIS: He's... he's
really quite an athlete.

CAROL: He's got a
lot of friends too.

I can't imagine he'd
have any enemies at all.


Did you hit or
beat Tim recently?

Why don't you just go find him?

Carol, he's just
trying to do his job.

Have you noticed any
changes, any changes at all,

In his behavior?

What are you talking about?

Drugs?

For Christ's sake, haven't
you been listening?

Why don't you cut this
bullshit interrogation

And go out and find out son?

What's going on?

Tim's been gone all night.

OFFICER: Jamie, did
your brother say

Anything, anything at all, that
might help us know where he is?

JAMIE: (SCREAMING) The lady in
the old Spencer House has him!

OFFICER: Calm down.

Now, Jamie, tell
us what happened.

Well, this woman is
staying at the house,

And Tim went over
there last night.

They started kissing,
and Tim couldn't see what

She really is, and she bit him!

Oh, come on.

She bit him?

OFFICER: Jamie, how do
you know she bit him?

I saw it happen in a dream.

What do you mean,
you saw it in a dream?

How can you be so
cruel to your mother?

Your brother is missing, and all
you can tell about is a dream?

But Mom...

That's enough, young lady.

Dad, you have to believe me.

I saw her yesterday.

I know she has him
down in the basement.

Go to your room.

It's true!

Go check on your sister.

Stewart, this is Unit 32.

We're 1097 at Spencer House.

Boy, look at this dump.

Gosh.

I don't know why
these kids play here.

Who knows?

We'll find out, though.

Boy.

I guess I'll go around back.

I'll check the place out.

What the hell for, Booker?

It's the only lead I have.

All right with me.

Nothing.

I didn't see nothing.

Well?

ADULT JAMIE (VOICEOVER):
When the police returned

And reported seeing
nothing, we knew

Than that if we wanted
to find our brother,

We would have to
do it ourselves.

JAMIE: Well?

I don't know.

I mean, this sounds crazy,
but I've seen her in a dream.

She wasn't biting my neck.

Will ya help me?


Sure.

We're gonna need a few things.

Why do we need the gun?

You never know.

[Music playing]

Let's go this way.

Wait a minute.

A cross.

I hope that thing works.

It does in the movies.

Great.

Shit.

That's Tim's blood.

I don't know.

Maybe we should call the cops.

They wouldn't believe us.

What do you mean,
they won't believe us?

We have proof.


What the hell was that?

Do you see anything?

No, I didn't...

TOM: Jamie, can...
Can you hear me?

Yes.
TOM: OK.

Just stay right there.

I'll find another way around.

TIM: Jamie, where are you?

Tim!

I'm up here, Jamie.

I'm over here, Jamie.

Tim!

Tim, wake up!

I hope your brother isn't
too thirsty when he wakes.


What are you doing here?

JAMIE: Me and Tommy
came here to find you.

TIM: That wasn't
a very good idea.

Tim, stop that.

You're scaring me.

I'm sorry, Jamie.

I'm just dying for a good drink.

Don't take this personally.


I guess your brother
couldn't handle it.

No, I stopped him with this.

That may have worked
on your brother,

But I have been here long
before your religion has.

OFFICER: Stewart, 1097
at the Spencer House.

Oh!

What the hell's going on?

She's coming!

Get back.



Give me the balloon!


You'll have to do
better than that!



Get outta here, Jamie!

Run!

DISPATCHER: Unit 1097,
proceed with caution.

Reported shots fired.

OFFICER: We need backup!

We need backup now!


TOM: Get your hands
off my sister!

I fucking mean it!

He's got a gun!

Freeze!


Tom!

We all died that night.

If I close my eyes, I can still
see them... smiling, happy,

Teasing... a true loving family.

But eventually, you
have to open your eyes

And face the bright
light of reality.

Mom and Dad never recovered.

They simply lost the
desire to survive,

And they were right, for
they had nothing to live for.

As the years passed,
my gift grew stronger.

The more powerful it became,
the deeper within myself

I hid, until I walled myself
away into my own little world.

But I closed my mind to
the reality of my vision,

Refusing to act upon what I saw.

My gift made my see.

The more I denied it,
the stronger my vision.

It was in front of
me day and night,

Gnawing, consuming, destroying.

I could deny it no longer.

Our fates were sealed.

Now all we had to do
was play our parts.

Mine required all the strength
I could possibly muster.

But the gift... my
gift from hell...

Had to reach its final end.

I have something for you.


ADULT JAMIE (VOICEOVER):
Timmy was right.

A family that slays
together stays together.

Shit.

You're crazy.

Is that it?

No, that ain't it.

This place was recently
called Gabriel Manor.

Yeah, that's right.

But wasn't he that
doctor with all

Those Harvard
Medical School awards

That... that went
off the deep end?

Oh, there's a lot more
to the story than that.

I knew you were gonna say that.

Creatures of light, spirits
of fairy, join me tonight.

I reach to the air,
oh, goddess, so fair.

Darksome night and shining
moon, east, then south,

Then west, then north.

Harden to the witch's room.

Here I come to call ye forth.

I conspire thee, oh circle
of power, that thou blessed

A meeting place of love, joy,
and truth, a shield against all

That is harmful and
wicked, a boundary

Between the mortal world and
the realms of the mighty ones.

May the goddess send you
through the grass for blade.

And as I wish, let
the spell be made!


All right.

This guy was a doper.

He's probably got a stash.

Let's find it.
OK.

You got it, chief.

He thinks this guy
has some stash.

Let's look around.

You got it.

Frank.

Hi, Miss Peters.

Hi, boys.

I guess he thought I
was closing in on him.

He couldn't take the pressure.

Heh, poor son of a
bitch hung himself.


Oh, hiya, Jessie.

Hi, Eddie.

Um, let... let me
get back to you here.

Jess, I got something
to show you.

Well, Jim, looks
like you got your man.

I couldn't have
done it without you.

Don't sell yourself short.

Well, let's face it.

Whenever I call you in on
a case, all I have to do

Is sit back and
wait for the corpse.


OFFICER: Chief!

Telephone!

Oh, hey, so what do I do now?

Consider yourself on vacation.

This is, until the
next psycho turns up.

[Music playing]

Come on, bitch.

Hi, baby!

Hi!

I got something for ya.


Here we go.

[Music playing]

Carefully, carefully!

Not to worry, my dear.

No harm done.

I'm sorry, doctor.

I'll get somebody to... hi, Nico.

Well, my boy, was it
a successful operation?

I got what you wanted, if,
uh, this is what you mean.

DOCTOR: You were careful to
make a neat and clean incision,

I hope.

After all, these are patients,
and we must take due care.

Yeah, doc.

I was real clean and neat.

The envelope, please?

You know, doc, I like being
in the medical profession.

It's, uh, very rewarding.

Here is your next
patient, doctor.

How soon must we operate?

Why, immediately.

Good.

MISS TESSBALL: Bye, Nico.

DOCTOR: Miss Tessball, please.

MISS TESSBALL: Yes, doctor.

WOMAN: What do you mean,
you can't find my dog?

My Muffin is the cutest
dog in the country.

What's the matter with
you people, that you

Can't find one little dog?

My tax dollars pay your
salary, and for that matter,

Probably the braces on your
kids' teeth and your car

Parked out there
in the parking lot.

Now get off your butt
and go find my Muffin!

Hi, Jess.

Look what the chief
got me for my birthday.

Hi, Eddie.

Hey, guys, wait up!

I gotta show you this.

Jess, I'm glad you're here.

Well, I got your message.

Oh, how was your vacation?

Short.

Jessica Peters, I'd like you
meet Special Agent Thurber

And Special Agent McGee.

Pleasure.

Jess is on a
special task force.

These gentleman are
with the Bureau.

MAN: [shout] Pick up the phone!

Thank you.

Take a look at these.

When did this happen?

OFFICER: Earlier today.

Any leads?

Well, it's the fourth one
this week, so needless to say,

We're not very happy about it.

Any pattern?

Yeah, well, that's
where it gets strange.

Seems our man is very
precise in his work.

He kills his victims
by strangulation.

We think he uses a piano wire.

He then very meticulously
extracts a body organ

And takes it with him.

Do we know why?

Well, these gentlemen
think they know.

I'll let Agent Thurber
take it from here.

Are you familiar with
a doctor Henry Gabriel?

Oh, yes, yes, I know who he is.

I know it is said that
he's one of the best

In the country in his field.

Well, he is also
one of the strangest.

Our office received
reports several weeks ago

That one of the corpses used in
the pre-med classes was stolen.

The hospital wrote it
off as some fraternity

Playing the usual college prank.

We decided to investigate.

Through our
investigation, we also

Found that a great
deal of various tissue

And organ life support equipment
had also turned up missing.

Well, how does this
involve Dr. Gabriel?

A good number of students
spoke frankly with us.

The general feeling
was that Dr. Gabriel

Was somehow behind all of this.

He often expressed the
medical possibilities

Of keeping separate
organs alive,

Assembling them
into one body shell,

And giving them unified life.

Why could he possibly
want to do this?

Well, it would appear that
our good doctor is immensely

Paranoid of the AIDS virus.

JESS: Let me see if I can guess.

He wants to assemble
his own little playmate

So he can remain safe.

But wait a minute.

How does he know that
the parts he using

Aren't from women with AIDS?

Good question.

It would seem, coincidentally
or uncoincidentally,

That all the victims so
far were recent patients

Of the hospital.

Therefore, their
blood had been tested

And was on record for any
of the staff to check.

Wait a minute.

This man is a
doctor, not a killer.

So how is it that
he's able to perform

These murders so efficiently
and without a trace?

We thought of that, so we did a
complete sweep of all the crime

Scenes thus far,
and on one of them,

There were some strange prints.

When we ran them, we came
up with those of this man.

His name is Nico
Moretti, one of the best

Hired hands in the country.

JESS: Well, why don't you just
bring him in for questioning?

If only it were that easy.

Lovely Nico's been untouchable
for almost 10 years now.

He travels under assumed
names and phony passports.

We may have a lead on this guy.

It seems we've had
several complaints

Of a loud motorcycle coming
and going from Gabriel Manor.

JESS: So you think that Dr.
Gabriel has retained this, uh,

Nico's services for
his new project?

Excuse my ignorance here,
but, uh, why not bring

In Dr. Gabriel for questioning?

Dr. Gabriel is a
pillar of society.

This evidence,
however revealing,

Is merely circumstantial.

His lawyers would never allow
us to get anywhere near him.

Unfortunately, even the
law has its limitations.

So Jess, you can
see why we need you.

What is your part of
the special task force?

Uh, let's just say that Jess
has a way of, uh, cutting

Through the red
tape of bureaucracy.

AGENT THURBER: Well,
however you do it,

I hope you catch
this wacko soon.

For all we know, this clown
could be at it as we speak.

Shit!

Fuck!

Oh, my God!

Aw, shit!

Son of a bitch!


Bitch!

You bitch!

Nobody cuts Nico Moretti!

Bitch!

Oh!

Oh.

God.

Wouldn't you rather
play nice than fight?

[Phone ringing]

Hello?

I'll be right there.


I got something here.

OFFICER: Get a line on it.

Drag it in, but take it easy.

Yeah, put the coroner on
standby and give her out 20.


It's OK.

Calm down.

JESS: Can I get through, please?

Excuse me.

OFFICER: All right.

OK.

Excuse me.

Yeah.

Yeah, OK.

When did this happen?

Uh, a couple hours ago, as
far as we can figure out.

We got a couple of
calls from neighbors

Reporting screams and a
commotion out here at the lake.

What was the
victim's first name?

Sherry.

And how long did you know her?

All my life.

Would you mind sitting down
for just a minute, please?

Chief, I've got a neighbor
here that was able to make

A positive ID of the victim.

Great work.

Do me a favor and give
her a ride home for me.

Thanks.

Yeah, right, chief.

Jess, I need to talk to
you for a minute over here.

Excuse us.

I just got off the phone
with some of the boys.

They're over at this
girl's house now.

They said the place is a
wreck... tables knocked over,

Blood all over the
girl's bedroom.

Why would he change his MO?

I mean, why dispose
of this body?

He didn't with
any of the others?

I've been asking myself
that same question.

The only thing I
can think of is,

All the others were
so clean and neat,

And then this one got messy.

Maybe he just didn't wanna
upset the good doctor.

Look, I'm going
to need the blood

From underneath her fingernails
and anything else of his you

Can get off of her.

You got it.

Great.

Um, listen, when do you
think we might expect

To retrieve our evasive psycho?

I'm going to see
someone right now that I

Think will be able to help.

Got it.

I hope so.

Be careful.

I'm getting kinda used
to having you around.


After all, I am a
witch, remember?

Deet, deet, deet, deet.


Don't be alarmed, dear.

It's only me.

Oh, you startled me.

I'm so glad you came.

The signal you sent
was very strong.

I need your help.

Yes?

Go on.

Well, I'm working on
this case, you see,

And it's unlike
any of the others.

[Phone ringing]

Hello?

Any luck?

JESS: Looks like I got
the key to the puzzle.

Did you get my package?

Yeah, I got it right here.

JIM: I was able to get you
his blood and skin samples.

Anything else?

Well, what do you mean?

JESS: Any other samples?

No, why?

I need three body fluids.

I can get the sweat
from the skin.

I've got the blood.

Oh, that leaves me one short.

Well, what do you need,
sperm or something?

That certainly would qualify.

Wh... what the hell's going on?

JESS: Look... look, I'll
figure something out.

Well, don't do anything stupid.

Don't do anything
'til you call me.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.

All right.

Look, I gotta go, Jim.

Bye.

All right, spy.

Salamander and dragons,
creatures of fire,

I call upon thee to
fulfill my desire.

By fire and smoke, I do
invoke our father from above.

Feel this right with your
might, with sacredness and love.

I cast thee, oh,
circle of power.

May this be a sacred place
for the lady and her lover.

May all that is evil be
banished by the spirit of water

And Earth, by the spirit of
air, by the spirit of fire,

By all the elements
and the human spirit.

I purify the circle.

I purify this.

I purify this circle.

DOCTOR GABRIEL: Cancel
all my appointments

For Tuesday afternoon.

Order me a quantity of
three-oh-silk for my lab.


Nico!

DOCTOR GABRIEL: That will
be all, Miss Tessball.

Yes, doctor.

DOCTOR GABRIEL: I didn't hear
from you yesterday, Nico.

Yeah, well, since
that last operation,

I've been doing some thinking.

And what were you
thinking about?

I've been thinking that I don't
know if I can do this anymore.

Not getting cold feet
on me, are you, dear boy?

Yeah, so what if I am?

I thought you found the
medical profession rewarding?

I'll be honest with you, doc.

This last one, it
got kind of messy.

I know.

I saw the newspapers.

And now I'm thinking, I'm
not enjoying it so much.

I mean, the first couple
were quick and easy.

But this last one... it was
real... it was real different.

Different?

What do you mean, different?

Look at me.

I look like shit.

I don't need this.

I'm used to a different kind of
work, a little more high class,

You know?

Hey, I'm not a butcher.

I'm a surgeon.

Certainly you are, dear
boy, but I just need you

To perform one more operation.

No way.

Forget it.

I'll pay you twice as much
as I did for all the others,

And all you have to do is
bring the patient here.

Go on.

This is the last and
most sensitive operation.

I perform this one myself.

This is your last patient.

[Music playing]

[Car horn]

Just lean on me, all right?

Go sit over there.

It's OK, all right?

Slow down.

It's all right.

Just lean on me, just
for a moment, OK?

OK.

It's all right.

It's OK.

Let's turn.

That's good.

That's good, good.

OK.

OK.

Thanks for helping me
get my bike around back.

It's OK.

Oh, I'm really sorry.

I didn't see you.

You came right out of nowhere.

Oh, gosh.

Are you sure you're all right?

I'm fine.

Fine.

It's only a scratch.

Look at you.

Gosh.

Maybe you should
change your pants.

Maybe you can help me.

My leg seems to be frozen up.

[Phone ringing]

Hi.

This is Jessica Peters.

I'm not available to
take your call right now,

But you'll leave your name
and phone number at the beep,

I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

Thanks.

Tillman, let's go pay the
good doctor a house call.

[Music playing]


WITCH: You'll have to
get this man from within.

You'll need three
of his body fluids.

Then, you will mix them together
and stir them with your root.


OK, Jensen, let's stand by.

This place is a mess.

Yeah, let's just worry
about what's inside.

JIM: Doc, open the door.

Open up, doc.

You need a warrant for this.

I got your warrant.

Doctor, what are
you doing with a gun?

Come with me, Miss Tessball.

I don't understand.

Then you will say
the verse of sight,

And you will take one drop
and place it on each eyelid.

Then, to complete
the spell, you will

Take the mixture
of fluids, pour it

Into the red candle
of the eternal flame,

Thus extinguishing his life.

Doctor!

What are you doing?

What are you doing?


DOCTOR GABRIEL: Get
out, you bastards!


No!

Doctor, no!

No!

No!

Doctor!

No!



Help me, please!

Please!

Jesus Christ, doc.

If you had to do this, why
didn't you just use one woman

And be done with it?

That would have taken all
the fun out of it, dear boy.


Jim!

Oh, Jim.

Oh, my God, Jim.

Thank God you're all right.

I was so worried about you.

I thought you were...

Come on.

We'll take you out of here.

I was so worried about you.

Just glad you showed
up when you did.

It was just awful.

What a lunatic.

I can't believe it.

I know, I know.

I got an idea, though.

Yeah?

What's that?

How about I whip us
up a love spell, huh?

Love spell?

How about an
extended love spell?

Yeah.

Like in the Cayman Islands.

OK.

How does that sound?

Sounds good.


RUTHERFORD: What is
it with this house?

How do you know all of this?

Oh, being a caretaker
has its advantages.

Heh.

I don't know if I'd
call them advantages.

Hey, give me a hand
outta here, will ya?

Thank ya.

Eh, that looks good.

Looks great.

But what is it?

Your grave, Rutherford.

BRANDY: Not bad, Jack.

Ah, thank you.

Well, I guess we'd better
go back to the office

And, uh, dig us
up another client.

OK.

What do you want me
to do with the car?

Put it back there
with the rest of them.


[Music playing]

So that's about it.

Zombies, vampires, witches,
with just a soup song of blood

And gore, all tied together
in a neat little package,

With music by Steven who?

MAN: Jude.

Oh, I almost forgot.

You'll see me, Jack Devlin,
take care of a guest.


MAN: [inaudible].

Ow.
