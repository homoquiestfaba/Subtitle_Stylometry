Nikita to abduct.

Have you any idea who?

Not really.

Any idea why?

There is a change in our
Family Tree.

My father is already deceased.

His oil and land threatening me
lose.

Why do not you call the police?

care.

I am not a babysitter but ...

I want her bodyguard are you?

Do you buddy?

I feel you

Roland, you're the only one who
I can trust.

Okay, what can I do?

Nikita, is out.

She is constantly locked
in here ...

and I can not

Fine, it could not be better with me.

We find a place where he can stay,
Indeed, we are practically family.

He is an expert in several things.
What do you think?

If I say yes then that means,
I left that house is?

Yes Ms that you can

Want a coffee for me?

Course, comes immediately.
Do you want a massage?

Nikita, he is not your slave, treatment
him the respect he deserved.

I respect him, Dad.
It is just that Voorhees ...

did everything I asked.
I understand.

Voorhees was a bodyguard who
we are lost in an ambush.

I get it. We were
always very close with him.

Mason.

Hello darling.

Our Dad has a new
beveiliger hired. Oh yeah?

Roland met Mason.

He found his answer in boxing

and correspondingly what he deserved
He paid off.

You know what this means?
What? I can step back.

Really? Yes. Come
I want to show you something.

It was nice to see you.

It is a lot of work.

Well, if I do go.
Is there much change.

Of course.

You have complex, Tommy
And Victor is very loyal.

They do everything you ask,
You're the boss.

Can we start?

Hey, listen to. You should really
not drive this car.

The inventory has arrived.

Is it readable?

Looks good.

Good.

Keep it up.
Yes.

Hey, Nikita, I have something for you.

Yes you see it here?

I Sat chains.

But not this one.
You know why?

It is a detection device.

It is rather ugly.
Turn around?

You know what that means?

Wherever you go
I can find.

That tickles.

What is it?

You do not fall on women?
Yes, I love women.

What?

Come on, we are waiting.

Coming.
You're the boss his daughter.

Come on put them urgently.

You look good.
Will he last?

Yes, he is coming.

Who is there?
Do you know him?

Jason Cross.

He is a very powerful man.

Very dangerous.

Very dangerous.

Should I be scared?

You might not?

Makes it fun. I shall return.
Be careful with him.

Ok. Let me try!

By that bastard over there and
you get in big trouble.

Mason?

I need you to talk.

Right now? Yes, right now.

I've never
just ask ...

not to do what you want.

I want you to consider
for me.

Think of your boxing career.

That is fun for us all.

If you understand where I
talking about?

Want to rumble with the chip?

Take it easy.

I do not want to pe
any problems.

I joined the Boy Scouts expelled
for eating cookies.

That sounds so stupid.

What you doing?

Come on.

You look like
'Jip and Janneke.

You dare to say much.

I am not.

Would you stay?

Where to go not the car
and give us the space.

Or drive to the chemist
or something?

I would not do
if I were you!

Hey, Nikita.
Where are you going, man?

What you, man?
They were friends of mine.

Stay away.

That is no excuse
for their behavior.

Where you going, huh?
Are you going with him now?

What would you do?

That sounds great.
Have fun together.

See the man.
We go.

Come on.

No, Daddy, Mason is out of control.

I bale of the time I
I lost to him.

Nikita?
Papa, he is in love with Esfane.

He is no different than other
men his age.

Men who quickly veelte
get everything ...

are always easy.

I wished him Roland
had given a beating.

What?

Was that a smile?

What?

Yes that's right.

Where is the former agent?

It is always Detective.

Jup, where he is, Victor?

He is to meet the city medicine.

Do you want to talk about ...

the fight in the bar?

Fight.

People from L.A.

What can I say?

Ballistic Nylon.

Popular stuff.

Smart boy.

He knows a lot.

Look out for him ..

If it is a problem.

You and your boss paid the price.

I'll let you know.

Yes do that.

I thought you forgot me?

I have some questions about
the kidnapping?

Mr. Wells has many enemies.

Most come from former
business agreements.

Where else has he
you for?

We are just friends.

I feel that I am a little
can help ...

with security problems
and the like.

We have been both agent.

He is not an agent anymore.

I no longer.

Your friend is associated
with rough people.

So if Cross?

Previously she acted together ...

When Conner's father
ran the business.

Can I ask you something?

What do you know about Cross?

He is organized.

And I think he's a
species is racist?

He believes that white and Mexicans
can not coexist.

That is crazy.

We were chasing him for years.

And no one was there to man
something about him.

Listen!

You want your friend to help.

And I want Cross.

I do not know whether we met
help?

That's what I say.

Both agents bring together
their own man.

Then we have a super deal.

Agreed.

Hey, Nikita!

Roland is back.

Is everything okay?

Feel your own safe now?

I do.

I like him, Dad.

Yeah I like him.

He gives me a secure feeling.

I guess I never updated as
someone I've felt so safe?

Except for you, Dad.

But something about him cross.

He is lonely.

But he will not
show it.

I really think he is okay,
otherwise I trusted him.

I know.

I think I'm going step.

Good.

I'm glad you're yourself again.

After all this misery.

I am proud of you.

Thank you

I'm looking behind me as you.

That is good.

Hello.

I'm hungry.

There is no food.

Do you want half of this?

Okay then.

And Tory?

Well you know what it is?

People who are bodyguards know ...

that they are at risk and
sometimes they pay ...

the ultimate price.

And I suggest that he did.

The only good reason for
innocence, seems to die?

You gave him ...

the maximum credit.

You know Manuello and Jorga
half brothers?

No.

He told me once, ...

but that he kept hidden ...

because he lives here, and ...

He is afraid to be recognized.

They have never told anyone ...

about private matters because ...

they did not trust.

I find that pretty cool.

I mean people like it ...

the way they are.

Every time I close my eyes ...

I see those men in ...

the garage shoot him ..

It is a terrible thing
for one ...

young girl like you because
experience.

It has great impact.

Yes.

The paparazzi caused
that Mason ...

The car did stop.

Look, there is one thing.

I am now.

Things will change.

It is just a nightmare.

It is not over yet, either?

It is not over.

But I care about is the rapid,
I promise.

Look, I ...

I'm sorry: that I own
behave so stupid sometimes.

I want you to know that I ...

really appreciate what you

is doing for me.

You are welcome.

Very Cool what you did with
Mason his friends.

There are so few
can fight.

Just amazing.

I have just one religion.

You know what your doing.

I was lucky.

Do you always eat that?

No.

That I wanted to say.

Are you sure you do not want to drink?

Among the work not drink young.

Why not?
You're bodyguard?

And I'm only driver.

We do not drink while working.
Understand?

I drink well water.

Yes, that's good.

Do they often?

Every Friday.

Are you serious?

Loose Saturdays.

Sometimes on Tuesday.

That is not good buddy.

Are you okay?

Is she okay?

Mason remained in the club
with his friends ...

and now he takes his
mobile no.

You know what?

He will call you soon.

There is something you have given me ...

when I was a little girl.

You're still small.

What was it?

It was an umbrella,
I think that yes.

He was very very nice.

He was hand made and ...

completely painted.

I can not believe you
still remembered.

You said in the North
owning land

You always told
fat stories.

That was really cool.

You said that you a while
have lived in Asia.

After your service.

Am I right? Yes, ma'am.

The good old days.

That was ... Chang Sahaia.

I still have that umbrella
in my room.

He is as pretty as ever.

I find that funny.

Can I bring you home now?

Yes.

Come on.

How are you?

You're late fighter.

What is it?

Why should I come?

Hey!

We need to talk.

Where is Mr. Cross?

I am.

Okay, I understand.
I tell you or.

Tell Mr. Cross:

I thank him for his offer.

But no thanks.

What?

Hear that?

He thinks he is cool.

Keep your hands off me.

Have you ever seen this?

Note.

No.

Are you psychopaths?

Keep your hands ...
Quiet.

Okay, man. Listen.

You want the girl, right?

Nikita.

I know what is on his land.

It just interests me
as much as you.

If you do this between us and the pause,
we do business.

You want the girl.

Then you get them.

We wait for your call.

Have a nice day, huh.

You are on my list man.

Hey, I have time for.

We all Controlling
who comes here, so your well.

Standard procedure.

Come, now get out here.

Roland will be angry
we have gone away.

What do you care
what he thinks?

Are your best friends now?

Why not?

He is a good score.

Jesus Christ

Where are we going?

Calm down.
This is faster, baby.

Mason?

Get out of the car, now?

I said, come from that car?

Mason do something?

Do what they say.

Roland?

Help me?

Sit firmly.

These guards chasing me
get it behind me away?

I head towards the North,
at Florett

Go back. No.

Roland?

Help me.

Get on that bike.

Keep your hands where I can see them.

Come on now.

Get on your knees.

Those guys wanted to murder me.

And they have a friend kidnapped.

Get on your knees. Yes, sir.

Give me coverage?

He is now in custody.

Report it here.

Roland, are you okay?

There are many people here ...

I think that you ...

am interviewing ...

tied to a stable chair.

I do this out of professional
Recital

and that's all I
can do.

I appreciate that.

I suggest that you contact
record with your lawyer.

This is perhaps, Texas ...

but not the Wild West

You can not just people
shoot on the street,

and then get away.

Look.

Even a citizen who witnesses
of an abduction ...

can see what is possible

what to do about it.

That's what I did.

That the court decides.

And let me tell you this:

Their death ...

and not you.

That is exactly what I say.

There is no case.

It was self defense.

John if you think:
he is wrong ...

he will avoid.

I give you my word.

Exactly.

Thanks Johnny

We have time for.

They work for Cross.
I know.

I've seen them together.

Tory Harris.

He is a lieutenant of Cross?

Yes, and?

Something intervened.

I'll be back.

Please, stay here?

Now what agent was.
He has three people slain.

Excuse me.
You're free to go.

Sodeju.

I talked to him
as you requested.

He was happy to see him today
in the church could meet.

What do you exactly
to find my daughter?

We could not find her, to
We know where she is taken.

You said that no ransom
was required.

Three of the kidnappers dead ...

were employees of
Jason Cross.

Forgive me that I am not blind.

We know of your past business
with Mr. Cross.

For your daughter in hell.

I urgently request you not
for us to hide.

Thank you.

You know what you should know
Nikita finds it.

There is another thing.

Roland Sallinger was released this afternoon
to help and I am sure ...

of a phone call from you.

Do you really think it wise?

The Chief was disappointed ...

but he knows that my word,
my deposit is

You should leave him alone he
has nothing to do.

That is not what Mason Silver
says.

He is not trustworthy.

If you have no idea who
has done or why ...

are you so sure that
he is innocent?

Because I trust him.

Now please go away.

It is late and other things ...

also need attention.

If the kidnappers contact
with you ...

I want to know immediately.

Hello?

Are you now so far
to talk?

Where is my daughter?

Safe.

Thank you.

But its still up to you?

Look, it takes more time they can
not getting found.

24 hours Conner.

And not a minute longer.

It does not take long before
it also gets the news.

Intelligence equals power.

Conner.

I do want from the uranium.

And if you dear Nikita
To look back,

give you my land ...

and 5 million in diamonds.

How can I be sure that
she still alive?

Cross you hear me?

Let's go.

Have you been able to contact them?
Yes sir, Manu is all there.

She says.

I do not know where he is?

Just keep sitting patiently.

I'll be back, okay?

Victor says he wants the items
and 5 million within 24 hours.

Have you the address of Mason?
Yes, I have an address.

I thought you do
could use?

Your religion is a
low ebb.

I did not know where else
I had to give you.

I'm nervous, okay?

Good evening.

How are you?

Well. It's better now.
And you?

Very good.

How many brothers do you?

But two.

But two.

That hurts.

They are in order and are ready
if you need them.

Are you sure?

I'm sure.

Are you sure? I know
sure. I owe you.

Thanks for yesterday.

No, thank you.

Yes I keep it.

Now do not you move?

This is good shit.

Keep it up.

Can you see it?

Man go by with cards,

I had no choice.

They said I had to testify.
I said I would not do.

I put my pride aside.
I screwed up.

Let me ask you a question.

Were you proud of your cross and then ...

you have arranged her abduction?

Look man, they said:
she would murder me.

I know you do not believe me.

But I love Nikita, and I
would never inflict anything.

She said she
would do nothing.

It was him or me, you understand?

If you love her,
protect your hair, you understand that?

Well where is she?

I do not know?

See these two dead here?

You are also like this
about 5 min

We had agreed
in the restaurant ...

on the other side of town.

Let me ask you something.

Go down here.

What is wrong here?

She sits on his lap.

You know what's wrong?

Nikita, running all kinds
danger at this moment ...

and you are home to the festivities.

Now I leave you the same risk
run as it does.

Understood? We go.

Yes, hello?

Your time is running out now.

I'm working on it.
Good.

Are we on schedule?
Yes.

I want Nikita talk?

She is not now available.

Do not worry you'll see her soon.

Where? Tomorrow 20:00.

I want some real estate deal.

Ma'am?

Will you hold him now?

No, I do not.

Cross is not stupid.

I make that mistake.

There is no police presence.

What will you do?

Just chase.

Thank you very much. Good evening.

Was it so hard to do
what we asked?

We have a problem.

You go that way Manuello.

Roland I'm touched.

Get out.

I think we need to talk?

Roland, how do you get in?

Well I have the restraint
regulated.

I know that.

I invented that
Mason has screwed you.

But I think you already know?

I had my suspicion.

My daughter trusted him
information to,

which he used against us.

What information would that be?
Where is he looking for?

5 million in diamonds.

Manuello thought I told you that?

You know?

I think there is much more
going on?

5 million is not much when you
compares with a similar robbery.

Tell me what's going on?

I understand what you meant?

I feel that we do not
on one line.

We are friends.

Sorry.

Cross and I grew up together.

He chose to become criminals

but we found something else
precious.

Uranium.

To cut a long story
short.

dearly.
