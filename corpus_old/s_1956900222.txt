(lion roaring)

(light orchestral music)

(plane engine roaring)

(fast-paced acoustic guitar music)

(elevator dinging)

(airplane engine roaring)

Can you go through with it?

Can you?


I love you, Daniel.

Is that an answer?

When I was little, my mother
always made me make promises.

Like tidy up the bed.


Promises I couldn't keep.

I always felt so guilty when I failed.


So, now I don't promise things.


Christ, Marie, I love you.

Ah, yes.

(airplane engine roaring)

When?

When are you gonna tell Alex?


In Mexico.

After a speech at the conference.

Where are my underwear?


Come here, Daniel.

Oh.

It ought to be so easy.

Shit.

Is that the time?

It's 4:30.

I've got to go.

I'm leaving for Acapulco in the morning.

[Daniel] Marie, wait.

Are you all right?

Yeah.

I am.

I'm happy.

(airplane engine roaring)

What're you doing?

Get in there.

Go on.

[Girl] Mommy, I can't find my left shoe.

(phone ringing)

Hello?

Hi.


(upbeat Mariachi music)

(speaking foreign language)

You wanted to talk to me about something.

What was it?

Can we stop pedaling this thing?

You should exercise more, Marie.

We used to play tennis all the time.

How come we don't play tennis anymore?

If you could see the clogged,
decayed arteries that I see,

even at 35 years old, you'd take exercise

a little more seriously.

What?

I was just thinking about
you and me playing tennis.

We used to laugh a lot.

-Hmm.

Yeah.

Laughing is good.

(both chuckling)

Pedal.

I don't want to.

I gotta take a leak.

I'm going in.

Just do it over the side.

No one will look.
No, I wanna go in anyway.

Shit.

I'm sorry.

It's my bad hand.

[Alex] Marie, I wish
you'd let Bobby fix that.

[Marie] Bobby's a plastic surgeon.

[Alex] Yes, he is.

The best.

Anyway, I quite like it.

(dreamy orchestral music)

(speaking foreign language)

Alex!

Alex, Alex, come here.

Move!

Alex.

Alex!

(boat thudding)

Help me!

Help me!


(people chattering)

(speaking foreign language)

Oh!

Oh, hurry!

(speaking foreign language)

(dramatic orchestral music)

(all clamoring)

(speaking foreign language)


(siren wailing)

(bells tolling)

(siren wailing)

(speaking foreign language)

What?

Where are they taking him?

(speaking foreign language)

I don't understand.

Do you speak English?

Al little.

Please.

Thank you.

He is your husband, yes?

Yes, yes.

He's my husband.

We will look after him now.

Then the doctor, he will come

and he will speak to you soon.

I must have some details.

Your name, a little about
your husband, please.

Um, Davenport.

D-A-V-E-N-P-O-R-T.

First name?

Marie.

And your husband?


Alex.

Dr. Alex Davenport.

Doctor.

His age?

39.

(dramatic orchestral music)

I should've told him before I came.

Why did I come?

This never would have happened.

What if he's brain-damaged?

God, how long will he be ill?

I should've told him before we came.

Why did I come?

Why didn't I tell him yesterday?

I feel so odd.

Where are the passports and credit cards?

Did I leave them at the hotel,

or did I leave them in that bag

on that stupid fucking pedal boat?

I'd be on the plane.

Nothing would have happened.

It might not be too bad.

Things always look worse than they are.

I should've told him at breakfast.

What if he's brain-damaged?

Why didn't I tell him?

Why?

These people looked better when they came.

I feel so hot and weird.

The passports.

Please, don't let him die.

(speaking foreign language)

Oh, excuse me.

Could you tell me what
date it is today, please?

Date?

August 15th.


We were in Carmel this time last year.

August 15, August 15, August 15.

Last year this time.

Last year.

Carmel.

Haunting me.

[Eerie Voice] Marie.

[Marie Voiceover]
It's just like some test.

I don't believe it.

It makes no sense.

It's not my fault.

The reason.

Everything, every thought I've ever had.

Oh, Christ, my imagination, my memory.

I can't.

I must separate them.

It's my imagination.

It's my imagination.

My heart went wild with memories.

Every thought of that day.

[Man] Senora Davenport.

(speaking foreign language)

(knocking on door)

Senora Davenport, please come in.

[Marie Voiceover] Is
this what it feels like?

I regret, Senora...

With a worry about right and wrong.

What to do.

Oh.

[Man] I'm afraid there
was little that we could do.

[Marie Voiceover] On my own now.

[Man] He suffered a very
severe blow to the head.

[Marie Voiceover] I'm single.

[Man] The fracture itself was small.

[Marie Voiceover] On
my own now, I'm a widow.

[Man] But the brain injury was...

[Marie Voiceover] What an old word.

Severe.

[Marie Voiceover] Daniel.

He was a doctor, no?

I got what I wanted.

Yes.

Did I?

He's a pathologist.

I don't understand how I feel.

[Man] I'm very sorry, ma'am.

We were-

At the international conference.

I know.

I listened to your husband's
paper on atherosclerosis.

Now, we will contact
the American consulate.

[Marie Voiceover] What do I feel?

[Man] To help you with the arrangements.

[Marie Voiceover] What do I want?

I regret, Senora, but in these cases

we have to perform an autopsy.

Would you like to see the body?

[Marie Voiceover] I've
never known anyone...

[Man] They're moving him now.

[Marie Voiceover] That
I fucked, or kissed, dead.


(dramatic orchestral music)

I'm sorry, ma'am.

[Man] Senora.

Thanks.

Thank you.

(dramatic orchestral music)

That blood on me was in him.

He's on my body.

I can feel him.

I can feel myself alive.

Dead blood.

Dead body.

I'm closer to him now than before.

So secret.

I'll never feel him again.

I'll never feel him again.

Never.


(dramatic orchestral music)




(speaking foreign language)

I don't understand,

the medical director wants to see me?

I thought Dr. DeMencos was
the one who was in charge.

No, this is the head of the hospital.

Why?

Does that mean the
autopsy's finished already?

I don't know, Mrs. Davenport.

The hospital called
the consul this morning.

Said that they had a problem,

asked if I could bring you over.

That's what I'm doing.

Excuse me.

(speaking foreign language)

Director, Mrs. Davenport.

Senora.

Have you told this
lady what has happened?

No.

I thought you should do that.

(speaking foreign language)

Senora, I must tell you

that your husband's body has disappeared.


What?

That autopsy had been scheduled

for eight o'clock this morning.

At six minutes before eight,

the pathologist on duty
found the plastic wrap

from your husband's body

on the floor of the morgue
and the corpse missing.

A full search of the hospital

and all the facilities
has been carried out.

No trace of the body.

The only remaining possibility is that

some lunatic,

perhaps someone who was
known to you or your husband,

has stolen the body.

No, no, no.

Someone who hated him?

It was an accident.

He was killed in an accident.

We don't know anyone in Mexico!

It just doesn't make any sense.

No.

Maybe he wasn't dead.

There is no question of that, senora.

I examined him myself.

The tests for brain death were made.

(speaking foreign language)

He was dead.

(speaking foreign language)

Shortly after seven last night,

I saw the body myself.

(speaking foreign language)

Madam, I know.

(speaking foreign language)

Anyone who has seen
dead persons as often as

Dr. DeMencos and myself knows.

(speaking foreign language)

Today I studied the
preliminary pathology statement.

(speaking foreign language)

There's no question of error.

There was no misdiagnosis,

even if there had been one,
by some unimaginable freak,

your husband, a doctor himself,
would he not have contacted

a hospital doctor or nurse about
such an astounding mistake?

Would he not contact you?

(light acoustic guitar music)

I regret the police will
have to talk with you.

This whole affair has been most regretful.

It is unparalleled in the
history of this hospital.



What's so humiliating,

I didn't even see it slipping away.

(phone ringing)



You called from work.

You were here weekends.

I don't know even where
you found time for another...

(phone ringing)


(dramatic orchestral music)


(suspenseful orchestral music)


What is this, a plot?

What, a conspiracy?

What, did she tell you what to say to me?

In case you forgot your lines
and didn't know what to say?

Huh?

Huh?

Answer me!

I'm sorry.

Listen, this doesn't change
the way I feel about you, Anna.

I wish it did.

It'd be a lot easier.


Stop it.

Stop it!

Stop it!

(speaking foreign language)


I've taken an apartment.

Here's the number.

If you need anything, call me.

Kiss me, Daniel.

Listen, please, Anna, please.

Daniel,

I'll still be here.

No, it doesn't change, does it?

(all chattering)

(plane engine humming)

(suspenseful orchestral music)

Well, Dr. Davenport's
keys are still here.

We still have him listed as out of town.

Oh, well, he was due in before me.

I just thought-

Well, maybe he got held up.

Yeah, maybe.

You picked the right
time to be out of town.

It's been a killer.

Just awful.

Losing my hair.

Hadn't noticed.

[henry] These tight hats.

They're bad for circulation.

Is that what it is?

[Henry] It's bad for the hair.

Oh.

It's okay, Henry.

I can manage.

[Henry] Well, I'm in no hurry.

It's okay. - [Henry] I'm in no hurry.

It's all right, I can manage.

[Henry] Enjoy your
evening, Mrs. Davenport.

Thanks.

Good night, Hector.

Good night.

(dramatic orchestral music)

Alex.

Alex.


[Woman] This is Dr. Corvin's office.

I'm afraid nobody's in right now.

Oh, shoot.

[Woman] But if you leave
your message after the tone

we'll return your call as soon as possible.

Thank you.

Where are you?


I'm back in L.A.

I really need to talk to you.

Alex is, I'll explain later.

But I really need to see you, though.

Please, please, please
pick up this message soon.

(dramatic orchestral music)

What have I hidden?

What am I hiding?

(line ringing)

Yes, this is Marie Davenport.

Are there any messages for me?

[Woman] No, Mrs. Davenport.

All your messages were
picked up this morning.

No messages at all?

[Woman] Oh, wait.

I'm sorry.

There was just one message.

A few minutes after noon.

It said, "Meet me in Carmel,
Monday, Cliff view Motel.

Call if you can't make it."

Was that from Daniel Corvin?

[Woman] It doesn't say who it was from.

But it came in just about an hour ago.


Thank you.


(dramatic orchestral music)

Mrs. Davenport?

Why, yes.

[Man] You're our only
guest for check-in today.

Oh, I see.

If I could have your credit card,

and if you would just sign this.

Oh, and I have a message for you.

From Daniel.

He's real sorry, but he
can't get here until tomorrow.

Thank you.

Is that all the luggage?

Yes.

I can manage.

Room's just right over here to the left.

Okay.

Thanks.

I never thought I'd come here again.

Oh, Daniel, why here?

(light orchestral music)


(breathing heavily)

(plane engine roaring)

[Eerie Voice] Marie.

[Marie Voiceover] I don't believe it.

I don't believe it.

I don't believe it.

I don't want this.

[Eerie Voice] Marie.

I choose, I choose.

Yes, yes, yes.

[Marie Voiceover] I choose.

I'm for real.

I choose.

[Eerie Voice] Bring me the priest.

[Marie Voiceover] No!

(dramatic orchestral music)


[Woman] In 1599, our Lady
of Carmel Among the Butterflies

was donated by Captain Portillo.

And thanks for the miraculous
calming of the elements

during which his vessels
were able to come about

and the crew saved from
almost certain shipwreck.

The statue itself, which is thought

to be 15th century in origin

was kept by the local Indians until 1891

when it was returned to the mission

and placed in this chapel.

[Sister] Yes, I saw her.

She's gone now.

(church bell tolling)

Daniel!

(knocking on door)

(suspenseful orchestral music)


Oh, my God!

Alex!

Shut the door.

Alex!

Don't touch me.

But you're here!

What happened?

I don't want anyone touching me.

What happened?

Okay.

Sit down.

Tell me what happened!

Please sit down.

Okay.

Al right.

Don't stare at me.

Okay.

I'm sorry.

I want you to promise me something.

Yes.

A promise, Marie.

All right.

No questions.

All right.

I ask all the questions.

The message you left for
me on the answering service.

You left that for me?

[Marie] I left it, yes.

This was an accident.

Wasn't it, Marie?

Oh, Alex, yes.

Please.

Please, turn away.

I remember swimming.

I heard that boat coming at me,

as if it were trying to kill me.

(Alex sighs)

What did the doctor say?

He told me you were dead.

I mean, I saw your-

No, no.

Afterwards.

What did they tell you afterwards?


They swore there were no mistakes.

One of them, this man said

if you'd seen dead
bodies as much as he had,

then you knew.

What did you think, Marie,

when you were told my body was missing?

I hoped you were still alive.

Why?

Oh, Alex.

Why did you leave the hospital like that?

Why?

If you tell me that

I promise I won't ask
you any more questions.

It doesn't matter, Marie.

Yes, it matters.

For Christ sake, I matter!

I mean, Alex, why didn't you come to me?

Tell me.

What happened?

I woke up in a cold, dark room.

And I knew right from
the smell of it that it was

a freezer room of the morgue.

I was lying there on a cold table.

No pad.


No sheet.

I thought it was a dream.

I thought it was a dream about work.

I was the corpse.

And then I sat up,

and I realized it wasn't a dream.

There was nobody around.

Nobody.

I just got dressed in a pair of scrubs.

Got up.


Even found a pair of old shoes.

Walked right past the main desk.

No one even noticed.

They just thought I was getting off work.

Alex, why?

Why did you do that?

Why didn't you tell them what had happened?

I thought someone was trying to kill me.

I had to leave Mexico, Marie.

I was so scared.

I just had to get out.

So paranoid.

I just had to go.

That's all.


I'm sorry.

Oh, Alex.

You're ill.

You must get some help, honey.

No.

No one can know.

Don't you see?

I won't be anything but a medical freak

for the rest of my life.

Go back to your room, Marie.

Sleep for an hour.

I'll stay here with you.

Just leave me, will you?

Come back later.

Okay?

Okay.

Marie?

[Marie] Yeah?

Lock the door.

Yeah.

Okay, yeah.

(dramatic orchestral music)

(dramatic orchestral music)

Alex.

Alex, can you hear me?

Oh, Alex, what's happening?

"Pulse fading."

60, 40, 20, 10.

"Temperature falling?"

(knocking at door)

Daniel.

Oh, sorry.

That's okay.

(thunder rumbling)

(phone ringing)

Are you trying the right room?

Well, there hasn't been
a reply there all night.

Yes, that is Mrs. Davenport's room, sir.

Try 132.

She's in 132.

Oh.

Okay, hold on.

We think we've located her.

Just one minute, please.

Okay, thank you.

(phone ringing)

[Marie] Hello?

Marie?

Marie.

[Marie] Yes.

Where've you been?

I've been trying to get you all day.


Oh.

Well, uh, I'm sorry.

[Daniel] Are you all right?

Fine.

Yes.

[Daniel] Well, I was worried
when I couldn't reach you.

You sure you're all right?

Yes.

Look, I'll be there tomorrow, all right?

I've gotta go.

Thank you for calling.

[Daniel] Okay.

Okay.

Thank you.

Yes.

(suspenseful orchestral music)

Who was that?

The desk.

No one.

The desk.

No one.

Sometimes, Marie, I have heard things.

I have seen,

seen

things I can't remember afterwards.

(birds chirping) (church bell tolling)

(speaking foreign language)

Ah, Father Niles.

Oh, yes.

There's a woman in the visitor's room.

You couldn't, could you?

You think you could-

Yeah, sure.

Just give me 15 minutes.

I'm gonna go shower and I'll be back.

No, no.

I've got the golf at half past.

I think I could do it quicker myself.

Oh.

You sure now?

Oh, yes.

35 years teaches you a trick or two.

Oh.

[Marie] Father Cassidy?

That's right.

And you are Mrs.-

I'm sorry to disturb you.

You don't know me.

I'm from Los Angeles.

Um, there's something
I'm supposed to tell you.

Go ahead.


I don't really know how to begin.

Well, why don't you sit
down and take your time?


First of all, you're
not gonna believe me.

(both chuckling)

And secondly, even though I went

to a convent school and all that

I'm not a Catholic.

I don't believe.

I don't wanna believe.

I haven't been to church since I was 15.

I see.

Uh, do you mind if I sit?

I was 15 when my mother died.

She was,

she was in a lot of
pain and very frightened.

And I prayed.

I begged God for her life.

But

that's very important,

the fact that I don't believe
in religion or any of that.

My husband doesn't either.

He's a doctor.

Well, now, the two aren't
necessarily connected.

Being a doctor and a non-believer.

I resent being here.

But I've been forced to come.

Forced?

Dear me.

Yes.

Dear me.

Last year,

almost exactly a year ago,

I came up here with my husband.

He was going to a
conference in San Francisco.

And while I was here, I met another man.

A doctor, too.

For the past months, I've
been having an affair with him.

Ah.


While they were at the
conference, I was alone.

Mostly alone,

and I went on a lot of
walks along the cliffs.

Do you know those cliffs?

I think so.

Down by the convent?

Yes.

I, uh,

I found myself looking

down on these two little, like,

like ponds, and,

down below the path, and I
felt something very strange.

It became very silent.

As if the sea had stopped moving, and

the branches of the
cypress tree began to move,

and I saw something.

Someone came out just below me.

It was,

she was,

it was a girl, 16 or 17.

She was, uh,

she was surrounded by
this golden path of light, like-

Like a halo?

No.

No, not like a halo.

It was,

it was more like a spotlight was on her,

a very phony looking light.

And she had a veil and a long, white dress.

And she looked up at me and she said,

"Marie, I am..."

She said she was,

oh, shit.

This is ridiculous.

I don't even believe

in the Virgin Mary.

Goon.

She said,

"Go and tell the priests."

Bring them.

Rebuild the sanctuary by this place.

That it may prevail.

Go and tell the priests.

"Bring them."

That was all.

A sanctuary.

"You will tell the priests.

Bring them."



I laughed.

I was frightened, but I laughed.

I mean, me of all people.

It's,

well, then it got very
dark and it began to rain

and the figure

disappeared.

I heard thunder very loud.

And I never told anyone.

Damn her.

No priests.

Until you.

Until now.

Damn her.

A sanctuary, she said?

Yes.

A church, a sanctuary.

Mmm-hmm.

Mmm-hmm.

What is your name?

Davenport.

Marie Davenport.

Look, it's trying to possess me.

It's destroying my life.

And now it's trying to force me.

It's threatening my husband's life.

It's threatening his life?

I don't understand.

You're still, despite your affair,

you're still living with your husband?

Yes.

I mean,

yes.

When are you going back
to L.A., Mrs. Davenport?


I don't know.


I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

I've done what they've told me.

I told the priest.

Now, maybe it'll be over?

Will there be an investigation?

Oh, I shouldn't think so, Mrs. Davenport.

The Church is very
careful about these things.

I suppose it comes from
the very human feeling

that if God wants us to know something,

He'll come tell us.

Silly, isn't it?

Such a great institution like
the Church can be so petty.

Prudence born of 2,000 years experience.

It'll be off your mind now.

It must have been a
terrible thing to live with.

I want to thank you for coming

and telling me about it, Mrs. Davenport.

It was nice to have met you.

Is that all then?

Mmm-hmm.

Now don't worry,

it's in my hands now.

You've done your part.

I'm sure that'll be an end to it.

Have a safe journey home.

(line ringing)

(knocking on door)

Alex?

Alex?

(dramatic orchestral music)


Are you all right?

What are you doing here?

What?

Pulse?

Yes, it stopped.

-It's as if

I went to a place,

I found a place

that knew everything.

I can't remember what it was.

A dream.

No.

Yes.

Yes.

A very bright dream.

I went to tell,

I'm helping you now, Alex.

I can't remember.

What?

(waves crashing)

Yes, it's,

it's as if you were there

with me.

Like you always are.

And I knew everything I've ever known.

Everything.

I just

can't remember now.

(waves crashing)

Peace be with you, sister.

I must speak about it now.

This is not confession.

This is not confession, Father.

But I must tell someone.

For more than a year-

Yes?

For more than a year

I've had the same dream tormenting me.

Go on, sister.

A woman, frightened, obsessed,

a woman haunted by the Virgin Mary.

The Holy Mother begs this woman

to build a sanctuary.

Is this a woman who's known to you?

No.

She's just a woman.

Quite young.

No one I knew.

Until yesterday,

when she visited with us.

-Hmm.

I know her name.

Marie Davenport.

(phone ringing)

[Woman] Cliff view Motel.

(woman chattering)

Oh, Daniel.

Oh, thank God you're here.

What the hell is going on?

(light acoustic guitar music)

What's wrong?

Alex is here.

What?

He's very ill.

He was in a terrible accident.

Jesus Christ.

Daniel, it's been so difficult.

I'll try and explain.

Did you tell him about us?


I couldn't.


You were with him
last night when I called?

It wasn't like that.

You weren't with him?

Yes, I was, but...

I left Anna.

Daniel, I'm sorry.

You're what?

You're sorry?

I'm sorry, but he's my husband.

I just can't leave him in that state.

I can't just turn my back.

I mean,

I don't all of a sudden
just hate him or something.

And it's,

it's still there, the,

all the time, the past.

The intimacy, whatever.

I don't know.

It's just,

I can't turn my back on him.

What, are you telling me
something I don't wanna hear?

[Marie] It'll be okay.

It'll be okay!

Jesus Christ.

Marie.

Do you still love me?

(light acoustic guitar music)

Yes.

I'm sorry.

Who's there?

Marie?

It's me.

I'm here, Alex.

Um,

I brought Daniel Corvin.

He's a doctor.

(suspenseful orchestral music)

I just thought

he should check and
make sure you're all right.

You left me again for two or three hours.

I was worried about you.

Alex, it's Daniel.


Do you feel any dizziness at all?

Hmm?

Any nausea?

(suspenseful orchestral music)

[Man] Some 73,000 people.


Oh, my God!

I'm sorry.

Oh, sorry.

It's my fault.

A priest always gives me a scare.

Priests always come when
you're, you know, dying.

Mrs. Davenport.

She's not expecting me, but-

Gone up to the city.

Sorry, you missed her by
maybe 15 minutes, Father.

Oh.

[Man] Someone took sick.

She took him up to the hospital.

San Francisco?

San Francisco, yes.

Thank you.

[Man] Fresno.

This ball game, statistically,

and yet only three points
up on the scoreboard.

(dramatic orchestral music)

(siren wailing)

Tell me nothing's changed.

Tell me nothing's changed.

Tell me.

Tell me.

Tell me nothing's changed.


You wanted to talk to me about something.

What was it?

(Marie crying)

(both panting)

Love me!

Love me!


Stop it.

Stop it.

Love me!

Stop it.

Stop it!

Stop it!

Stop it!

Love me!

Stop it!

Stop it, stop it!


Stop it!

Stop it!

Stop it!

Don't leave!

Don't leave.

What's wrong?

What's wrong?

What's wrong?

Love me!

What's wrong?

Love me! (sobbing)

(dramatic orchestral music)


It's all right.

It's all right.

It's all right.

It's all right.

It's all right.

It's all right.

It's all right.

Marie.

It's all right.

It's all right.

It's all right.


It's all right.

It's all right.

It's all right.

It's all right.

(knocking on door)

(shower running)

Mrs. Davenport?

I'm Father Niles.

I'm a colleague of Monsignor
Cassidy who you spoke to.

How did you find me?

I called in at the motel and they,

I just wondered if we could talk.

I'm sorry.

I didn't realize.

No.

I don't want to talk.

My husband's better.

He's much better.

Monsignor Cassidy told
me about what you've seen,

what you thought that you'd seen.

I don't want to talk to you.

To any of you.

Are you sure, Mrs. Davenport?

Yes.

My husband is fine now.

It's over.

It's finished.


I've gotta get going.

I'm gonna miss my flight.

I promise I'll be back as soon as I can.


I'll be okay.

Are you gonna be all right?

Yeah.

Oh, shit.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

You can get me another one,

you know, when all
this is straightened out.

I love you.

I know.

I know.

I'll call you.


Check that thermometer, will you?

His temperature readings aren't possible.

They checked okay.

[Man] Nobody, nobody drops

to those levels until about
five minutes after death.

This is Mrs. Davenport.

[Man] Good morning.

Good morning.

Is he-

His vital signs are stable now.

The crisis is over.

He just seemed to-

Marie.

I'm here Alex.

I'm here.

Marie.

Yes.

What is it, Marie?

What?

Why is this going on?

I keep seeing you all the time.

Always.

As if you...

What's going on, Marie?

Tell me.

Tell me!


Hold him down!

Five mil valium, stat.

[Marie] Somebody do something.

[Man] Come on.

He's calming down.


(Marie crying)

[Man] Let's go.



[Man] Damn it, get his IV back in!


It's all right. (sobbing)

Here.

It's all right.

I think we better talk, Mrs. Davenport.

(dramatic orchestral music)

And then,

and then suddenly he was gone.

It was as if I wasn't in
control of my own life,

of my own destiny.

So, I ran.

Dr. Davenport?

(footsteps thudding)

That day I'd tell him it ended.

We'd planned it.

Daniel and |I.

We'd planned that I would tell him.


I sat there with him like an assassin

beside her victim.

Only this assassin had
been given a second chance.


And there were the butterflies again

as if they were leading me
straight back to that place.

[Nurse] Dr. Davenport?

Watch my finger.

We are not made or unmade

by the things that happen to us.

It's our reaction to them that matters.

That's all God cares about.

Do you understand?


No, I don't.

A miracle,

if that is what you saw,

it's only a sign,

it can never compel consent.

There's no reason to believe
that your husband's illness has

anything to do with any of this.

But he died.

And then he came back two, three times.

Oh.

I don't know anymore.

And to most that would
seem like some kind

of demonic possession.

Yes.

Yes, it does.

But Satan

has no power over a man's life or death.

Only God touches that.

Life and death belong to God.

And everything else,

everything is ours,

yours and mine to decide.

(light clicking)

[Marie] Do you wanna go back home?

Doctor.

No, I want us both to go
back up to Carmel again.


If that's what you want.

Corvin.

Daniel Corvin.

What about him?

Why did he come to Carmel?

Did you call him?

Yes.

Why?

Because he's a doctor.

Because I was worried about you.

Why didn't you call a doctor from Carmel?

What's going on, Marie?

Did you tell him about what happened

in the hospital there in Acapulco?

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

I guess you did.

I'm sorry.

Oh, Alex.

Yes?

(dramatic orchestral music)

I wish I could remember
the last time we made love.

(thunder rumbling)

Come, lay beside me.

(dramatic orchestral music)

Just beside me, Marie.

No one will know.

You know what I wish?

I wish that we could go on.

(thunder rumbling)


Marie!

I'm here.

I'm here.

You can save us.


Alex.

Alex!

Save me.

Alex?

What?

Are you all right?

Stop it.

Alex!

Bring the priests!

What?

(Alex screaming)

(glass shattering)


Okay!

Okay!

I'm going, I'm going! - God!



(phone ringing)

Hello?

[Marie] Father Niles?

Yes?

Father, I,

I don't know what's happening.


All right.

Al right.

(knocking on door)

Monsignor.

(owl hooting)

(wind howling)

(knocking on door)

(door creaking)

(chattering prayers)

(voices whispering)

(thunder rumbling)

I know this place.


I know this place.

I've never spoken of it

or of you until last week in confession.

I dreamed a dream that happens here,

that happens to you.

(dramatic orchestral music)

(speaking foreign language)

[Eerie Voice] Marie.

(wind howling)

Marie.


(eerie voices chattering)


(thunder rumbling)



(thunder crashing)

(speaking foreign language)


[Martha] The cross!

Marie, look!

The cross!


[Marie] Nothing else?

I found something.

You saw nothing else?

Nothing.

Marie?

Marie, what did you see?

Nothing.

[Martha] Marie?

Nothing!

I saw nothing, nothing, nothing!

Mariel

I saw nothing! - What did you see?

Nothing! - What did you see?


Oh, God!

Marie?

So, you did manage to bring the priests.

Monsignor, the cross.

Look.

It's incredible.

It's incredible.

Then, you yourself saw this happen?

The sky was dark.

There was thunder.

And the sea became completely calm.

[Cassidy] But you saw.

Nothing.

I felt a presence.

It is a miracle, Monsignor.

My dream.

The calming.

His holy burden marked here
on the cliff beside our convent.

Mrs. Davenport?

(dramatic orchestral music)

Perhaps, Mrs. Davenport,

it was all just for you.

Just for me?


Things like that don't happen.

We are none of us obliged
to believe in miracles any more

than in aliens from outer
space unless we see them.

It's over.

No.

It's hardly begun.

Marie.

(light orchestral music)

Something,

something surely happened, Mrs. Davenport.

And now you are not alone in knowing it.


But I choose to deny it.

Is that what they want?

A shrine to a lie?

Rebuild the sanctuary.

What is a sanctuary?

It is a refuge.

It is a safe haven.

Have you not heard of
the refuge in marriage?

The safe haven of one's husband or wife?

The sanctuary of marriage.

It, too, is a holy place.

It's a long, hard road back to a faith

that you've once lost.

I'll be glad to walk it with you, if ever,

that would be no small
miracle, Mrs. Davenport.

To choose and to cherish

the love who made me for Himself.

Not to pass,

but to be in Him in love forever.

Late have I loved thee.

It's what we all say in the end.



Thank you.

(dramatic orchestral music)

[Daniel] Marie!

Marie!

Oh.

(dramatic orchestral music)

(light orchestral music)

(lion roaring)
