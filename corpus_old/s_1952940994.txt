Uh-huh.

Don't "uh-huh" her.

What?

I know you know better.
She knows better.

Mmm-hmm.

Okay, now, Mrs. Daniels,
you do understand

that as Maria's
appointed foster parent,

you take full responsibility
of this minor?

Okay. That's it.

CONNIE: That's it?

Yes, it is. Just follow the

And good luÂ¢l<_

Thank you.
Thank you so very much.

Thank you.

I was talking to Maria.

CONNIE:
All right, follow me.

Going to come out here,

and we are going to
put you to work.

Great.

Okay.

Let'S start
with these.

An right.

And let's set
a couple of rules.

Like what?

Like curfew at 9:00,

and you're not allowed to
hang out with your old crew.

You ain't got to
worry about that.

They ditched me
a while back.

Any more rules?

Well, not a rule,

but I would like you to start
thinking about your future,

Like, what do you
wanna do with your life?

If it was up to me...

VVl'\3llâ‚¬Vâ‚¬l".
It doeSr'l" [matter.

What about your dancing?
You used to love that.

Look, I got to get a real job.
It's not like I can make any money dancing,

Excuse me? Honey built this
studio with her dance career.

We all can't be like your
daughter, Mrs, Daniels.

Well, if anybody
could be, it'd be you.

What have you...
Give me that!

This ain't no
mirror cleaning.

Now, see, your problem is,
you are not motivated,

Now, look at that. That is what a
mirror's supposed to look like.

MR. KAPOOR: No, come on.
Please, Maria.

MARIA: Oh, come on.

Maria, please. Please. What?

I don't think you working
here is a good idea.

Why? You want to heal' me num?

I don't trust you
anymore. Okay?

Mr. Kapoor, you know me.

I messed up one time.
One time!

You know what they say.

Once you go bad,
you never go back.

Wait, no. It's...

it's once you go "black,"
you never go back.

But that makes no sense.
How can you go...

Is that what
they really say?

Hmm. I'll try 10
l'â‚¬mEfT'lbâ‚¬l' that.

Besides, Maria, I'm running a
business here, not a charity, okay?

I'd really like to help you,
but I just can't.

All right, maybe not.
But I can help you out.

Right?
And hows mar?

Hey!
Put it back.

Put what back?
I ain't got nothing.

Yeah?
Damn!

HOW did that
get in there?

I saw you take
the bracelet, too.

Hey! Nobody steals from Kapoor!

Big Lester, grab him!
Grab him!


Big Lester,
did you see him?

It was just her.

Oh, God.
These frigging kids.

Now, tell me, how did you
know she was stealing?

When she walked in, I just had
this feeling something was up.

Mmm. Maybe l cound
use you here after all.

So, I go! the job?

Yes, but on
a trial basis.

Okay.

If you screw up...
Whoop! Outside, okay?

What do you want?

I heard you were here,
and I wanted to see you.

Well, you saw me.
Now leave.

I thought we could
hang out.

Maybe catch up.

That's what you get
for thinking.

You sun tripping off
mar stuff mar happened?

Did you really
just ask me that?

You need to
get out of my face.

What did you

It ain't like we
would've shared a cell.

You did juvie.
I would've got real time.

Hen, what l got

your kind of love.

And you can keep it.

Look, I've changed.

I ain't caught up in all

I've been straight since you left.
No hustling or stealing!

for cursing me out?

Oh, I was having

That's got to be
the finest janitor ever.

Hen, yeah.

And you know what?

I think she needs some of
this pimping right here,

You got no swag and
no chance with that.

Watch me, kid.

Darnell.

I'm telling you, man...

Excuse me,
sweetheart?

(CLEARS THROAT)

Excuse me, miss?

You are far too fine
to be sweeping these floors.

What if I told you I could change
your life if you just take my hand?

Uh.,.

I'm waiting for
the punch line.

That was a joke, right?

Uh,

Awkward.

What? I don't even know...

That's how much you owe for
the stuff you tried to steal,

the mess you caused
and that bracelet.

You better
get out of my face!

What are you going to do?

First, you need to check your tone.
This is my cousin.

And please believe I will break

Cool it!
I got this chick.

She's a thief.
I caught her shoplifting.

You did that, Tina?
Brandon!

Who are you going to believe?
Me or this janitor?

I'm sure
the janitor has a name.

Who are you?

Don't worry about
who I am.

Just keep your little
hoodrat on a leash.

CARLA: Damn!

I know that chick.

Her name's Maria, She used
to dance with Luis and them.

The 718?
Mmm-hmm.

Yeah, okay.

Damn!
That was the business!

Damn, boo,
you are the truth!

Carla, really, you got to stop
talking like that to people,

What, college boy?
I mean, she knows how I meant it.

Girls can say that to
each other, all right?

Lt'S like when black folks
call each other "my..."

Quit it while you're behind.
Baby, stop.

Lail"I'll ever seen 8 New York
Clal'1CeF that Could turf like that.

Did you live in Cali or something?
No.

I learned it from
this girl I used to know.

You think you can
teach us how to do it?

Really? What happened to, "I'm
going to break your ass in haltâ€'?

Yeah, that was before
I saw you dance, though.

Whatever, Lyric.
We don't need her.

I think we do, Tina, because I've
never seen you get down like that.

So, you interested?

No, thanks.

Why not?
YOU'l'â‚¬ here an me time.

What you got to lose?

Is cleaning toilets
keeping you busy?

I bet she's going
Crawling back to the 718.

Girl, if I wasn't
on probation..

Ooh! What would you do?

You know what?
I'm just not interested.

Hey, what's going on?

It's the 718.
They're buying everybody slices.

When why?

They always do
stuff like that,

Last time, they handed
out school supplies.

My moms really loved that,
but I'd rather have the pizza.

YOU'l'â‚¬jUSI in time.

For whai?
What is all Of this?

What does it look like?
We take care of our own, Ma.

I mean, if not US, who will?

So, this is what you meant
when you said you changed?

Yeah, part of it.

I'm trying to do right,
at least.

Didr'l't Seem like it

Man, I was just
having some fun.

No.

Difll'1EI"S On me.

Thanks, but no.

I'm just trying to feed you, I
ain't trying to get you pregnant.

Okay. But I'm not staying long.

MARIA: (LAUGHS) Do you remember
your cousin's wedding?

Yo, you got so lit.

I wasn'l too buzzed to
catch the bouquet, though.

Right. After you knocked over the
old lady and the flower girl.

Oh, my gosh, it was an accident!
Nobody got hurt.

The flower girl
lost a tooth, Maria.

It was already loose.

And I gave her the bouquet
to make up for it!

True. True.
Okay, then.

Oh, man. You know, after a
while, the DJ wasn't that bad.

We danced for a while
after everybody left.

It was nice, though.

I thought about
that night a lot

when I was gone.

Have you thought about
coming back to the crew?

I'm so tempted.

You know how much
dancing means to me.

Come dance with us
tomorrow.

I know once we get back at it,
it'll be just like Old times.

That's what I'm
afraid Of.

Hey, you know I got you.

(HIP HOP PLAYING)

Is that all you missed?

You know,
we could have it all now.

I just wish you would've
listened to me back in the day,

Are you blaming me
for what happened?

Don't sweat it.

We can start all over.

(POLICE SIREN WAILS)

(Klcl<s CANS)

Hey,

I'll dance with your crew
on one condition.

Yeah, what's that?

We get on Battle Zane
and we beat the 718.

Wait, hold up.
You're trying to use us to get revenge?

That, and part of
the grand prize is that

your choreographer
gets an internship.

That'S the kind
of break I need.

Who said you were going to
take over our choreography?

BRANDON: I mean, we
could use the help.

Rigm now,
we're just winging it.

Her Stuff could
push us over the top.

Au right,
so can we get started?

No, see,
you're tripping.

AUdmOl'1S BTS if the end of the month.
Let's do this.

BRANDON;
Tina, Lyric.

Part of the grand prize
is $100,000.

I know we could
all use that money,

but with your grandma's medical
expenses, I thoug ht.,.

Why you got to
put us on blast?

No, I'm not.

Look, you know I
got your back, always.

And if you really
don't want her in,

just say the word
and I'm down.

But I think we should
do it for Grandma. I do.

And if I say no, I'm
the bad guy, right?

Pretty much.

All right,
Fine, she's in.

CARLA: Yeah!

But if she gets in my face
again, I'm going to cut her.

With what?
Your razor sharp wit?

My what?

I just said yes to you
to get in my crew.

DOf't'1i'lalk to ITIS
like that.

All right. Five, six, seven, eight.
It's one, two, three,

four, five, six
and seven, eight.

One, two, three...

One, two, yep, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

You guys got to trust
that the guys have your back.

And you guys need to turn,

and you guys need to know
that they're coming.

Three and four, five and six,

One, two, four,

Are you serious?

Get up! Ge! up!

Carla, pay attention!

Whoa!
Oh, my God!

TINA: This is So Stupid.
I'm not into it, right?

Yo, can we just stop arguing
for two seconds and focus?

How are we supposed to know what
we're doing if we can't even see?

That's the whole point.

You guys are using your eyes
and those mirrors as crutches.

You need to learn how to
trust your instincts.

Trust each other.
Think you can do il?

Just turn the damn music on already.
Shit.

LYRIC: Watch ii! Whoa!

(FAST-PACED MUSIC)

(ALL WHOOPING)

That was dope.

I got to hand it to you, girl.
You're really getting us there.

I feel like we might even have
a shot to win this thing.

We'll See! We're going to need to
come a lot stronger than this,

I know that much.

Wow! What is your problem?

I guess I can't
help telling the truth.

My bad.

Hey, I like
what you're doing.

Keep it up, and all the haters
are going to have left is hate.

I appreciate that.

Later, y'all.

PSHCG.

Same time tomorrow, B?
Yep.

Fife me.

Later, D.
You got it, bro.

Bye,


Don't listen to Tina.

She talks a lot of smack,
but she's a good girl.

Yeah, it's not her smack talk
that pisses me off.

I think
she might be right.

Was Tina right when
she said that you're

trying to win this thing
to get back at Luis?

Notjust Luis.

It's like, most of my life, people
told me I'd never be anything.

So, what is it
you wanted to be?

Honestly?

I want to be a dancer.
And I always have.

I think we
should go somewhere.

Okay. Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?

You'll see.
We're going to get cleaned up.

(MARIA GRUNTS)
Yeah.

Yeah, watch, watch.
Whoo!

How did you know
about all those places?

I'm a dance major
at NYU.

And part of our curriculum
is to experience the arts.

My head is just busting
with ideas right now.

All the stuff we could do,
like mixing the stuff we saw.

You know what I mean?
Like, if we go...

Barn! Bam! Bam!

Bam!

You know?
(CAR HONKING)

Thank you!

Do you even realize what you
do with your choreography?

It's like you're telling
this beautiful story.

What?

"Beautiful"?

Yeah, I said it.
Beautiful.

What's wrong with that? Nothing.

Just, if that's the way you step to
girls, your game is pretty weak.

You might want to take
some lessons from Darnell.

What? Are you serious? Yeah!

Darnell?

Okay, I would never
do that, first of all.

Second, I bet I do know
what impresses you.

What?

What?
What are you doing?

Yo, yo, what up, Ma?
You dig my swagger now?

Or you still fronting
like you stunting?

I'm just saying, shawty.

What's a brotha got

You need to quit.

I just want to
make you happy.

Oh,

Now what?

Now, I want you to

I've been doing that

Mr. Kapoor, you work too hard.
Do you know what you need?

Yes, an employee who

No, you need to
dance more.

No, thank you. I only dance at
the funerals of people I hate.

Come on!
Stop being so grumpy all the time.

I'm warning you, Maria.

Okay, look,
I studied the show.

All the past winners
are well-rounded.

This will help us.

Right.
And with this new style,

it's like we've
been dipped in culture.

That's one thing I know
the 718 doesn't have.

Culture.


Dipped in culture.

I don't think so.

BRANDON: Come on,
it's a good thing.

This stuff will help us.

Come on.

Fine.

KATRINA: Sorry.
Maybe next year.

You guys are wack.


I tried to Yell you, Maria,
You're just not good enough.

And those two new dancers ain't
going to save you either.

Now, beat it.

Sweetie, don't make this
difficult on yourself.

We're doing it again.

JONAS:
Well, well, well.

Now, this just got
more interesting.

(MUSIC PLAYING)


Listen, we've decided
that because of your dancing

and the obvious tension between
you and my boy Luis here,

that this Should make
for great television.

HD, welcome to
the Battle Zone.

(ALL SCREAM JOYOUSLY)

Thank you.
Thank you.

We did it.

That was insane.

It was nuts.

Not just the way
we made the show,

but the way you
stood up to those judges.

I mean, you were like, "Hell no!
Y'all are going to check us out!"

Okay, I just wanted our crew
to have a fair shot.

I give you
mad props for that.

We finally feel like
a real crew, you know?

And that wouldn't have
happened if it wasn't for you.

I respect that.

You're welcome.

You can take that one to them.
I'll get the other one.

Okay.

Make them save me
a slice, though,

I will.

I'm in.

So, where's Brandon at?

I texted him.
He must still be taking his finals.

Finals? He could've skipped
those to come celebrate, man.

You don't skip finals, bro.
That's why they call them finals,

The boy is trying to
get his edu-macation on.

That don't make him any
different than the rest of us.

We all just want to
dance for a living.

Yeah, but we don't all have
filthy rich parents like he does.

What are you
talking about?

His family owns
half Of Texas.

You didn't know?

His family makes the Hiltons
look like the Hammers.


Can't touch this.

Really_ Really?

He's good
with kids, too.

He te8Cl'1â‚¬S 3 ClaSS
with kids?

Yeah. Once a week.

You didn't know
that either?

What do you know?

Let me ask you
a serious question.

Do y'all actually ever talk or just bone?
She just be like...

Shake it, baby!

Yo, Carla.

Check it out.

CARLAI Oh, uh-uh.

She is about to be
sleeping with the enemy.

Good stuff today.

Thank you.

Watching you move
was amazing.

Stop it.

Hey, I'm serious.

Tina, is he
bothering you?

No, he was just telling me how
much he liked our audition.

No, I said I like
your audition.

You're the one who brings
the heat to this group.

Tina, did he tell you that
you're too good for us

and that you should be
dancing with his crew?

Yeah, he did, but...

Tina, he's trying
to play you.

Hey, calm down.
I told him I would stay with the HDS.

Wen, good.

But you act like I ain't even
good enough to dance with them.

I diunw say mar.

Sounds like that's
what she's saying to me.

MARIA: You know what?
Stop starting trouble.

Leave our crew alone.

Tina, are you going to
let her dis you like that?

I mean, I know if someone
in my crew called me out,

we'd battle on the spot.

Wow! I am not calling her out.
And if we're going to battle,

we're going to do it as a crew
and take your sorry ass out.

And what's stopping you?

What's stopping you?

(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

See that, Tina?

She's scared.

She's scared!

If you were on the 718, baby,
you wouldn't run from nothing.

Whatever.
