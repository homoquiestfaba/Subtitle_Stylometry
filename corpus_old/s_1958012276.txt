Hello, Presleys. I'm Barbara.

So nice to meet you.

I know. I know it's a little rough,

Oh! And have you noticed

Come on, Frank. Give me a break.


So, what? You'd rather listen
to some old white dude play guitar?

Terry Kath is one of the greatest
guitarists of all time.

is one the greatestâ€¦"

That's not true.
Jimi Hendrix is the greatest.

Oh. Did you read that in <i>Rolling Stone?</i>

No, it's a fact. Ask anybody.

Or just ask Jimi Hendrix himself.

He said Kath was his greatest inspiration.

He was a genius.

The dude accidentally
shot himself in the face.

A genius he is not.

[pensive music playing]

You know what?

I'm sorry you're so unhappy.

Okay?

Now, we're all here
trying to get a fresh start.

I'd appreciate it if you'd come at it
with a little bit more positivity.

How many fresh starts are we at now, Dad?

I lost count.

Can you come in

Come on.

[can rattling]

[paint spraying]

Umâ€¦

I don't think
you're supposed to be doing that.

Some racist douchebag
wrote my number down.

I keep getting text messages
asking for free rice.

Free rice?
[paint spraying]

[in Japanese accent] Oh! You don't know?

Asian people only eat rice.

Why not just change your number?

So, I should cave under the pressure
of institutionalized abuse?

Uh, no. I meant...

Besides, do you know
how clutch this number is?

222-POOP.

Phone numbers that good
are, like, impossible to get. [scoffs]

So, uh, Iâ€¦ I think we're neighbors.



My family just moved
into the house next to yours.

You moved into the House of Death?

House of what?
Everyone says it's haunted.

I'm an atheist, so I'm not
supposed to believe in that kind of shit,

but secretly, I'd love to die
and then, I don't know,

come back as some fierce ghost
and haunt Ted Cruz.


Anyway.

Uhâ€¦ Neighbor, we should hang.
What are you doing after school?

Oh, umâ€¦ After schoolâ€¦

Well, I, umâ€¦
I have a lotâ€¦ I have to study.

That's one thing I have to do, study.
Cool.

Okay, well, uh, I guess you know my number
in case you change your mind.

Or if you need rice.

[hip-hop music plays muffled over stereo]

Oh, what's with that face?

[woman] How was your ride home?
Great.

How about you, Kevin?
How was your ride home?

Good.

Fulton, give me your phone.
Why?

Susan said she saw your brother
walk to school this morning.

You had one job.


Kevin.

No comment.

It's not happening, bro.

Listen, I know itâ€¦ it probably worked

Sit down.

Come on.

Cool shirt.

My dad got into a fistfight
with the guy in the lane next to us

over an order of buffalo wings.

Manager threw my whole family out.
They banned us for life.

Can you talk?

Just moans and groans?

Did you, like, die here?

In this house?

You don't remember?

[wistful music playing]

Do you remember anything?

So,

it's Ernest, right?

The name on your shirt.

I'm Kevin.

[whooshes]
Whoa.

That's so trippy.

Nice to meet you, Ernest.

Soâ€¦

we can't touch you, but you can touch us?

Hmm.

[chuckles softly] Kind of like a stripper.



I need your phone.

Jeez, it's freezing in here, man.

Yo, butt munch. Your phone, come on.

Why? Why do you need my phone?

Because, unlike you, I have friends.
It's your fault Mom took my phone away.

Um, I didn't drop me
a mile away from school.

Okay, where is it? Right there? Where?
No. Fulton.

Stop! Fulton!

Get off of me! Fulton!

[pensive music playing]


[footsteps retreating]


Why are you in such a chipper mood?

What?

to be in a good mood?

You can be in whatever mood you want.
You know.

Good mood is good. It's just rare.

Hey. Let him have it.

Thank you.

Okay.

Fulton, give it to me now!
Hold on.

We have a ghost.

Okay.
No, I'm serious.

Kevin caught him on camera. Look.

That some kind of scary movie?
[Fulton] No.

[ghostly groaning]

Hey, this is pretty good.
How'd you do this?

I didn't do anything.

[ghostly groaning]

Oh shit!

Oh, we gotta show Mom.
No, no, no, no.

We can't tell her about this.
Why not?

Because she'll freak out. You know this.

Come on, pinky swear.

Seriously?
Get it up. Come on, pinky swear.

[Frank] Kiss it.
I'm not gonna...

Kiss it.

Yeah. Send me the video.

"It smelled of peppermint and rot."

Sh!

"She was a child."

My ghost is still with me.

He followed me home
from a Red Lobster six years ago,

and I can't seem to shake him.

Now, I have tried to...

Excuse me! I'm having a conversation here!

He's very possessive and a homosexual.

I am so tired.

Thank you.


Oh God, please.


Hi.

Hey, have you seen that viral video
that's been going around?

I don't do social media.
It makes me nauseous.

Well, guy finds a ghost in his attic.

I mean, it looksâ€¦ it looks pretty legit.

Oh, thisâ€¦ this isn't my book.

Mm.

It has over a thousand views.

[Kevin] Don't quit your day job.


"Cool graphics.
What are you using? Maya or ZBrush?"

"Lame-balls. I've seen better stuff
on <i>Ghost Hunters."</i>

What?
They think this is fake.

Yeah, but it's real.

Frank. Are you guys watching dirty stuff?
What are you watching?

Nothing.
Dad posted a video of... Ugh!

Fulton, I just bought those oranges!
[Kevin] God!

Worried about the oranges. Cool.

Organic fruit is expensive.
You guys are up to something.

No, we're not.

Nothing.

Where are you going?

What? He's gonna get the ghost

Yes!

We have a ghost in our attic!

Mel, I'm sorry. I should've...
And then to hear it from someone else?

Somebody who saw it on freaking YouTube?
What happened to communicating more?

Wasn't that the point of sitting through
20 sessions with Dr. Mouth-breather?

Okay. I'm out.
Kevin.

30,000. I'm so getting laid for this.

Fulton!
Get out of here.

Mel, I'm sorry.

We are moving.
No. Wait, no. No, no, no.

Wait, wait, wait.
No. No, no, no, no.

We are not gonna be like

every stupid white family
in every horror film. We are leaving.

Will you just hear me out? Please, listen.

Mel.

I don't think
you understand how big this is.

We've captured something
no one else ever has, ever,

in the history of the recorded world!

This is not up for discussion, Frank!

Okay. So who are you
gonna sell the house to, huh?

Because every dollar we have
is wrapped up into this.

Well, if it wasn't for you
and that stupid video...

And that's my point.

That's money, baby.

Look, you have guys out there right now
making millions on their channel

by playing <i>Minecraft</i>

And, Mel, we actually have a ghost!


This feels like Houston.


Houston was a pyramid scheme.
That's different.

Thisâ€¦ this is real.

but we're ready for you downstairs.

I'm so sorry. Thank you for your patience.

We'll be right down.

Look, this is important, okay?

Now, this show has a huge following.

Now, if we nail this,

I'm talking about book deals,
merchandisingâ€¦

We could be the Black Kardashians.
Don't you wanna be Kim Kardashian?


Anyway.


Fine.
You'll talk to him?

I'll try.


Hey, Ernest.

Ready to have some fun?

Are we rolling?

Oh!

[sucks teeth]

There.

Oh. So, Frank.
[chuckles]

The entire world right now is captivated
by your interactions with Ernest.

Yeah.

You know, but there's
a fair amount of skepticism out there too.

I mean, even myself. Even myself.

I was like,

"I don't think I believe
these videotapes," you know?

But now that I am here,
right in this room,

feeling what I'm feeling,

I meanâ€¦ [chuckles]
â€¦it's all very palpable, isn't it, right?

Yeah. Ernest is real.

There'sâ€¦ there's no magic here.

Soâ€¦ is he here now?


He's just shy, you know?
There's a lot ofâ€¦ a lot of people.

Uh-huh.

[inhales, chuckles awkwardly]


Frank.

Oh. Oh. Umâ€¦ [chuckles]

Uhâ€¦

Ernest!

You here, man?

[tuts] Ernest, everyone's waiting.
[Melanie inhales]

[Kevin inaudible] No.

Okay. Okay.

Listen, Frank, if you could just, uh,

fix your little hologram machine, okay,
'cause I need to get outta here.

No, no, no. There is no hologram.

Ernest!

We're outta here.
No, wait.

[Judy] We're done.
[Frank] Stop, no. Stop, please.

Justâ€¦ just wait, please?

They wanted a ghost. They got a ghost.

Yeah, they wanted a ghost,
and we gave 'em <i>The Conjuring</i>.


Oh, it's funny to you, huh?
Everything's a joke to you.

Fulton, not now, man.

We're getting tons of views
on the new video.

You posted it without my permission?
Yeah, so?

I'mma get sued, man!

[screaming on video]

Three million views in six minutes.

That's gotta be a record, right?
Mm.

Good work, man! [laughs]

Hey, kiss my ass, Pewdiepie.

[urine splashing]

Sorry. Need a minute.

You can't be in here.

Says who? Your stupid gender norms?
Beat it, roach!

[zipper zips]

Joy, what the hell?
Are you losing your mind?

No, but prepare to lose yours.

[pensive music playing]

It's not him.

Yeah, but that's why we couldn't find
a death certificate.

Ernest Scheller isn't dead.

That guy used to live
in your house though.

I cross-referenced, like,
a bunch of records to make sure.

So, who's our Ernest?
Mmm.

But I bet my left nut
that guy knows who he is.

You bet your what?
That Ernest lives somewhere in Oklahoma.

I'm still trying to find out where.

But he used to own this dive bar
that's still around.

Oh shit! That's like a mile from us.

Yeah, I know. What if we took him there?

Who?

Our Ernest?
Yeah.

Maybe they knew each other.

Maybe it was like a hangout,
and there's a trigger there.

Joy, he can't leave the house.

Heâ€¦ He's stuck there.

Are you sure?

[hip-hop music playing]
Ernest! I love you, Ernest!

Nonexclusive? [laughs]
Are you kidding me, man?

Look, I'm already runnin' original content
through my channel

and making three times what you offered,
so think about what you just said.

Think of a number and call me back,
all right? Bye. [laughs]

[hip-hop music continues]
[doorbell rings]

Frank, can you get the door, please?

No, look, I'm serious.
Like, an Ernest cartoon would be amazing.

But I want it to be
something like Adult Swim.

Have you ever seen a naked ghost?
I haven't. What would that look like?

[doorbell rings]

Frank, are you gonna get the door?
What parts would a naked ghost have?


[music stops]

[crowd clamoring]
Sorry. We're not talking to the press.

Just a few minutes of your time,
if I may, please?

And Joy was doing all this research.

Found out that the guy who lived here
used to own a bar not too far from here.

So we figured,
if we could get you to the bar,

maybe you'd remember something.


Joy.

Come on.

You're right. Sorry.

that if we could getâ€¦

[Joy gasps]


Oh my God, I'm sorry. It'sâ€¦

I love this. I'm... I'm a fan.

I just... I know I'm being annoying.

Just, this is a thing
that's actually happening, andâ€¦

Sorry.

Sorry.

Anyway.

We need to get you outside.

Are you sure you can't leave?

[mouthing words]


Have you tried?

I mean, really tried.

Okay.

Listen, Ernest.

I get it.

You've been here a long time,

and the world is such a scary place.

Believe me, sometimes it terrifies me too,

but there aren't any answers
left in this house.

If we're gonna find out who you areâ€¦

what happened to youâ€¦

it's out there.

I am so sorry to come over here uninvited.

I would've called, you know, but...
Sorry. What's the point of this visit?

[breathes deeply]

Back in the late '90s,
I was recruited by the CIA

to spearhead a program called Wizard Clip.


Wizard Clip?

Is that like, y'all just get high
and watch Harry Potter movies andâ€¦

Babe.

Wizard Clip was a textbook spook op,

hidden from most echelons
of the government.

Our field was paranormal psychology,

but our orders were
to find and apprehend a ghost.

There's nothing to be afraid of.
I promise.

Okay?

Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

Listen to me. Listen.

[sentimental music playing]

You're not alone anymore, Ernest.

I'm right here with you
every step of the way.

You got this.

[bird chirping]

[pensive music playing]

Soon as word got out that

millions of taxpayers' dollars
were being spent on woo-woo science,

we were abruptly shut down,

and the agency
threw me under the proverbial bus.

A sacrificial lamb.

It was soul-crushing.

But then along came Ernest.

Okay. Thank you so much for coming over,
but as you can see, we are busy.

I'd like to see him.

That's not gonna happen.

I don't think you understand
the gravity of your situation.

These entities, they are dangerous.

I'd like you to leave, please.

They may present kindly,
but they are never who they say they are.

I'm not gonna ask you...
Your son Kevin.

He's close to it.
I've seen it in the videos. He's at risk!

All right! That's enough! Now, get out!

This is a matter of national security.
I have a right to be here.

Then come back with a warrant.

But until that time,
get the hell out of my house.

I'll be back.

That's a promise.

[pensive music playing]

[crowd clamoring]

[door hinge creaks]

[indistinct muffled chattering]

It's him!

Shit!

Oh my God! It's him! It's Ernest!

Why didn't he do that sooner?

This is bullshit.

Wellâ€¦ [moans] â€¦I hate to remind you

about a little thing
called the Fourth Amendment.

They're harboring a terrorist.

I'm not sure a ghost
would legally qualify as a terrorist.


They'll make a mistake.

And when that happensâ€¦

we'll be ready.

You gotta go.

See? There is a connection.

I knew it.

Hold on. You're that kid, aren't you?

I don't know what you're talking about.

With the ghost in your house.
It is you! Holy shit!

Okay, thank you for your time.
We have to go.

You're a genius.

This Scheller guy
has to know who Ernest really is.

And to think that you doubted me.

I never doubted you.

Now we just have to find where he is.

<i>Ernest, come on! We gotta go!</i>

I think a warrant just fell
right into our lap.

"Ernest The Not-So-Friendly Ghost."

"Paranormal Whacktivity."

They think he's a monster now.

He saw something out there.
Like he was remembering something.

Well, it looks like
he's trying to kidnap Shirley Temple!

And why didn't you tell me
he could go outside?

That should've been my exclusive.

You're not listening to me.

He said a name,

it was, uh, June something.

So what?
So maybe that's why he's stuck here.

Something happened to him. Something bad.

Maybe if we help him remember more,
he can, uh, cross over.

Cross over?

We don't want him to cross over, Kevin.
We need him here with us.

You really
don't give a shit about him, do you?

I give a shit about us!
This is about our future.

This is about Fulton's college tuition.
It's about yours.

Don't make this about us.

It's about you.

Always is.

Hey, I'm not finished talking to you, man.

Are you kidding?

I was already in jail.

math tutoring, choir practice.

of my life, and it's exhausting.


It's a culture thing.

We have to be the best.

Prove that we belong. It's bullshit.

like he doesn't even know me.

He just sees this fake version of me
that he created.

I don't know.
I guess it's what a lot of parents do.

but they just mess 'em up more in the end.

I'll stay here.

Keep a lookout.

Honk the horn
if you see anything suspicious.

Stay out of sight, okay?

Hi.

Are you Ernest Scheller?

I'm...
I know who you are. Come in.

That's my wife, Ramona.

Suffered a stroke last year.

Can't really do much these days.

Have a seat.

Can I get you something to drink?

Um, juice, pop, pineapple juice?

Ramona loves pineapple juice. [chuckles]

Whatever you want.

No, no. No, I'm fine.


Funny thing, I, uhâ€¦

I was in a bowling league ages ago.


One day, I can't find my shirt.

I looked high and low.

Ramona said I was always losing things,

even the damn shirt
off my own back, but, uhâ€¦

I knew something wasn't right.

I didn't see that shirt again

till a couple of weeks ago
when I saw one of your videos on the TV.

Well, I've seen
some crazy things in my life, but thisâ€¦

I really can't believe this is real.

His name was Randy. Randy McGovern.

That woman next to him
was my wife's sister, Evelyn.

Dear, kind woman.

She died from, uh, complications in labor.

He had a child?

Daughter. June.

Junebug.

Randy, what happened to him?

Ramona and I never really wanted kids.

Just always thought we'd travel,
see the world.

But life had other plans for us.

After Evelyn died,
Randy sort of fell apart, I guess.

Took to drinking.

Then one day, he showed up
at our house with little June,

said he had an appointment,
needed us to watch her,

but he never came back.

Just left that poor little girl with us.
She was four.

Nobody ever heard from
or saw that man again.

Maybe something happened,
like an accident or...

Police found his car
for sale at a used lot,

uh, his watch at a pawn shop.

He took my shirt,

my driver's license.

Might have used that
to change his identity.

What do you think happened?

My guess, uh, drank himself to death.

Suicide, maybe. Who knows?

It'sâ€¦ it's hard to feel much sympathy
for somebody like that,

abandoning their own motherless child.

I can't think of a greater sin than that.

No.

No. No, no. No way.
He wouldn't do something like that.

You said it yourself.
He can't remember, right?

Maybe the reason he can't remember,
because the truth, what he did,

is too unbearable.


Randy? That's you, isn't it?

Are you sure?

Yeah.
Let's get you home.

I guess this worked out for you, huh?

I think, considering the situation,
it's a pretty fair exchange, don't you?

Now you and your family
can go live a normal life.

[wistful music continues]
[door opens]

[door closes]
Hey.

Sorry about your car.

It's just a car.

You good though?

Yeah.

[pensive music playing]

[indistinct chattering]

[scanner beeping]

[electrical whooshing]

waiting for this moment

for so long.


[wistful music playing]


[guns whirring]

No, no, no.

Stand down. I'm good.

[door closes]

[people laughing]

Come on, just right this way.
Ah, there she is.

Ah, the woman of the hour.

Gentlemenâ€¦ Oh, and lady,

please meet Dr. Leslie Monroe.

Oh, actually, I correct myself.

Agent Monroe.

She assisted us in capturing
the asset you see before you.

Very good job, yes.
[clapping]


So, now...
No, please, please, just take a look.

[Schipley laughs]


Of course you did more than just assist.
That was just...

What's the endgame?

[Schipley] I'm sorry, endgame?
[Leslie] Wellâ€¦

What are you gonna do with him?

Well, he's dead, so, uhâ€¦

whatever the hell we want.

[Schipley pats shoulder]

[wistful music playing]

[knocks on door]

[dog barking]

[door opens]

Hi, um, is Kevin around?

I haven't seen him at school.

Uh, yeah, he's just taking
a little break from stuff, honey.

Maybe come back another time?

Yeah, okay.


Hey.

You haven't responded to any of my texts.

Yeah, Iâ€¦

I haven't really felt like
talking to anyone, soâ€¦

It's okay. I get it.

How is everything?

Well, I'm grounded until I'm 80,
but other than that, super peachy.

Um, I justâ€¦ I wanted to check up on you.

Cool.

Thanks.

No, really though. Are you doing okay?

Yeah.

I'm fine.

See you around.

[door opens, closes]

[wistful music playing]

[thunder rumbles]

Hey.

It's so quiet up here now.

Feels strange. [chuckles]

It was raining like this
the day you were born.

I remember because
I was driving your mom to the hospital,

and traffic was so bad.

I thought she was gonna
give birth right there in the car.

I was petrified.

I made a promise to myself
that if we made it to the hospitalâ€¦

I was gonna be the best dad in the world.

[thunder rumbling]

It's funny.

When your kids are little,

it's easy to be a parent.

They don't see who you actually are.

They just see the good stuff.

What you want them to see.

But eventually, as they grow upâ€¦

parts of yourself that you don't like
become harder and harder to hide.

I guess

I never really figured out who I am.

I've just always chased stuff.

New places, new jobsâ€¦

hoping something would click,

and I would finally be the man
I wanted to be for you and Fultonâ€¦

and your mom.

But then Ernest came, and I was like,

"This is it."

I could finallyâ€¦

have a purpose.

I could finally be worthy.

I lost myself all over again.

I let you down, kid.

I broke my promise.

[wistful music playing]

I know you're upset about Ernest.

But you tried to do the right thing,
and that's all that matters.

You're a better man at 16

than I am at 45.

I admire you, Kevin.

You turned out great, in spite of me.

[thunder rumbling]

[ominous music playing]

[thunder rumbling]

[device beeps]

Can you face me, please? Turn towards me.

[device beeps]

Turn around.

Turn around.

I said turn around.

Comply.

Comply.

I said comply! [echoes]

<i>Comply!</i>

[wistful music playing]

[ominous music playing]

[somber music playing]

[somber music stops]

[electrical crackling]
[screams]

[scanner beeps]

[electrical crackling]
[screams]

[scanner beeps]

Comply!

[man grunts]


Yeah. Works on the living too.

[alarm blaring]


Get out of here.

[dramatic music playing]

â€¦figured it out.
Where is our Uber?

It's a Lyft, stupid.

You're stupid, Tara.
Oh my God!

We're gonna get mugged and die out here.
No, no.

It's gonna be fine.
We should go to Taco Bell!

[all exclaim]
Yes!

Wait, is that it? Oh my God!
Oh my God! Thank you!

Hi, hi, hi.

Is this for Gabby?
Uh-huh.

[girls screaming]


Holy shit, man!

Ernest, dude!

Uh, excuse me. This is my Uber.

Uh, it's a Lyft, bitch.

Bye!

Wait!

Hell yeah! [laughs]

So, which way you headed, Ernest?
[siren blaring]

You got it.

[rain pattering]

[thunder rumbling]

[pensive music playing]

Ernest?

[distant thud]

[distant thud]

[thunder rumbling]

[distant thud]

[hinge creaks]

[ominous music playing]
[man] I missed this house.

Randy, a ghost.


Fifty yearsâ€¦ I've kept this secret.

But the chickens
finally came home to roost.

I don't know anything. I swear.

You're lying. You came after me.

I was just trying to help him.
You're lying!

[Frank grunts]

Frank. Did you hear that?
Okay. All right. Yup, yup, yup.

Stay here.

Be careful.
All right.

[tense music playing]

What are you doing?
Thought I heard something!

Shit. [breathing heavily]

Me too.

Stay here.

Yeah, right.

Come on.

[tense music continues]

[thunder rumbling]

[ominous music playing]

Drop it.

Okay. Okay, take it easy.

[bat clatters]

Please don't hurt my son.

It was Ramona's idea.

She couldn't have kids of her own,
and when her sister died,

she said it was a sign from God

that Randy couldn't take care of June
without her mother.

She made me do it.
I didn't want to. She made me.

We can talk about this.
Just put the gun down.

Don't!
Okay, okay.




Dad!
Let's go!

Dad!
[Fulton] Come on!

[both grunting]

[Frank grunts]

[tense music playing]

Get away from them!


Go to Mom!


Come on!
Stop it!

Kevin, no!
[Kevin] Get in!

Kevin, no! Kevin!

[Fulton grunting]

Kevin! No! Please!


[tense music continues]

[thunder rumbling]

[tense music continues]


Little Junebug. [chuckles]

She made Ramona so happy.

That's all she really wanted
was her own little girl.

She doesn't talk to us anymore.

Maybe deep down she knowsâ€¦

[Kevin screams]
[Ernest grunts]

[both grunting]


[both grunting]

[both grunting]

[dramatic music playing]



I killed you!

[thunder rumbling]

I knew you'd come back.

[footsteps approaching]

Kevin!


[Frank screams]
Dad, no!

[Ernest yells]


[Frank panting]

[thunder rumbling]

[wistful music playing]

Kevin.

Dad.

Okay. I got you. You okay?

Yeah.
Okay.

[Frank panting]

Ernest.


Thank God.

[distant sirens blaring]

[sirens fade]


This ghost that was haunting your house
for, what, 50 years, just suddenlyâ€¦

he's gone?

It was dark.

It was raining. It was hard to see, butâ€¦

Iâ€¦ I looked around, and he wasn't there.

Whyâ€¦ why would he just vanish like that?

I don't know.

Maybe he didn't need to be here anymore.

Found the guy who killed him

and got closure.



What really happened, Kevin?

[wistful music playing]



[wistful music continues]



Hi, Daddy.

[emotional music playing]


[music fades]


Okay, let me try. Let's see.

[grunts, scoffs]

I suck. Okay.

[wistful music playing]

[wistful music continues]

[music fades]

Bye, Ernest.


Tell me what happened.

[feel-good music playing]


Oh yeah. I'm sure you're just devastated.

[Fulton laughs]
Why aren't you studying, boy?

<i>Dad, come on. It's a Saturday. Please.</i>

Yeah, and what the hell is a Saturday?

Go study.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

But I feel bad for whoever has
to deal with this shitty attic.

[both laugh]

You know, I don't really think I'm down
with you not being my neighbor anymore.

Well, I'm only like five miles away.

[Joy chuckles]
Plus, I get my car soon.

Okay. Smell you, bitch.

I know. Ka-ching!
Haunted houses are a thing now.

[both laugh]

[Frank coughs]

Figured I'd find you two up here.

Dad.
[Melanie chuckles]

Hey, the truck is loaded.
It's time to say goodbye.

Uh, last chance for y'all
to do whatever y'all were doing

or gonna do before you did.

Stop it.
Last chance.

Please save me.

[Kevin] Thank you.
I got this.

Come on. See you downstairs.

Thank you.
[Frank] Bye.

Yes, great.
[Frank] However you say bye.

Myâ€¦ my parents.
Mm-hmm.


[wistful music playing]


Do you think he can still see us?

Wherever he is?


Maybe.
