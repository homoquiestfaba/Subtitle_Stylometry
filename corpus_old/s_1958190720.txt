That's it. I can't take this anymore.

Why? No, Jamie.
It's almost over.

I'm just tired of this kind of movies.

But, I wanted you to watch this movie.

I've seen it like ten times before.

I don't understand why you want to torture me like that?

They say that fear is a great aphrodisiac

Of course, they do.

Beside, I found horror films reprehensible

The gay community is very poorly represented

Right the firsts to die or demonized

or someone is even brushing up on hysteria.

Okay, I give you that the gays usually die first

but

a case can often be made that the monster himself,

which is usually the reason we watch these movies, are

sexually ambiguous and acting up on frustrations

So, when you're cheering for Jason Voorhees

you're actually cheering for the gay community.

Whatever... Are you coming to bed or what?

There is no sexual frustration in here

Eric?

Eric?

You're trying to scare me?

Eric?

Jesus!

What?
Nothing.

Are you drinking now? Is it not like a death wish?

You're wearing that...
That is a death wish in a slashed film.

Oh. I was counting on being
impaled by someone tonight...

You! Bed! Now!

Eric?

Eric?

Are you trying to play with me?

That ain't to be that easy.

I can use this movie myself, you know?

I should know better  and then undo the creepy lock in the room.

Ah!!!
I got you!

You are awful!

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

Just jocking.

You know, someone told me that fear is a great aprodisiac.
Oh yeah...?

What you get rid of the stuff under the bed last week?

I did. Why?
