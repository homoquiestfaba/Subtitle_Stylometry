[insects chirping]

[wind blowing]
[leaves rustling]

[indistinct whispering]


<i>Don't be scared.
It's just me.</i>

[overlapping voices]

[boy] <i>I tried to tell her...</i>
[woman] <i>Can you hear me? Hello?</i>

[voices become muffled]

[voices get louder]

[voices stop]

[woman speaking Tagalog]
Did you invite me?

[animals calling]

I didn't know I was here...


Who's there?

[high-pitched screeching,
thumping]

I'm sorry, what are we doing here?

Who are you?

[high-pitched screeching,
thumping]

[ghostly voice]
Sanzaru.

[woman speaking Tagalog]
Is that your name?

[woman speaking Tagalog]
Mr. Sanzaru?

[high-pitched screeching]
[ghostly voice] Sanzaru!

[women vocalizing]

[boy speaks Tagalog]
Auntie...

[repeats in Tagalog]

Yeah?

She fell on the floor.
[distant moaning]

She was trying to get into my room.
[moaning continues]

What?

Move, move.
[woman groaning]

[bird screeches]
Dena?

[screeching continues]
Dena.

What are you doing here?

Go get the strap.
It's in the chair in there.

Okay, I'm gonna
sit you up, okay?

One, two, three.
[grunting]

Okay, okay.
[groans]

Okay.

Okay.

Are you hurt anywhere?

I was looking
for my charivari.

There was a boy
sleeping in Clemy's room.

[grunts]
Here, under, under.

Here.

[buckle clicks]
[groans]

Okay, one, two...

[groans]
...three

[bird screeches]

Okay.


[bird chirping]

He shouldn't be in that room.

Shh.

[bird chirping]

[door closes]

[mysterious music]

You okay?


[wind blowing]

[women vocalizing]

[wind chimes tinkling]

Up already?

[Dena] Morning.
Good morning.

Let me check.

Oh... sorry, cold hands.

Okay.

[woman] One...
[grunts]

One, two, three.

[sighs, urinating]

[vocalizing continues]


[chatter on TV]

It's too hard this week.

Hmm.

What's the clue?

"Harmony, as in music."

Melody.

Ten letters.
It might start with a C.

Consonance.

C-O-N-S-I-N...

Consonance.

C-O-N-S-O-N-A-N-C-E.

Consonance.

It works.

[chatter continues on TV]

[bird chirping]

When does your brother
get back from school?

What?
Your brother, when does he get off school?

He's been taking things again.

What are you
trying to say, Dena?

Oh, dear.

I'm sorry.

I'm frightening you.

It's okay.

Was I rambling again?

Just a little.
[groans]

[bird chirping]

I'm sorry.

Don't get old.
[both laugh]

[bird chirping]

[static buzzing]

[buzzing stops]

[gasps, groans]

What is it, Dena?
I...

I'm sorry.

Be patient with me.
It's okay.

I was going to say something,

but I can't find the words.

They're...

inside me.

I can feel them.

But...

Do you want to listen
to your music?

Yes, please.

Sister, it's me...

<i>Hey.</i>
[door closes]

<i>No word
from the school yet?</i>

[static crackling]

I can barely hear...
[boy] Is that Mom?

[tap running]

Hold on...
[woman] <i>Okay.</i>

Hey.
<i>Hey there, buster.</i>

<i>You didn't call me back.</i>
Sorry.

<i>You doing your schoolwork?</i>
Yeah.

<i>You've got to do all those workbooks.</i>
I will, Mom.

<i>How's it going there?</i>

It's fine.
<i>Yeah?</i>

<i>I know this is hard, but hang in there.</i>
Yeah.

<i>I love you.</i>

Okay, you too.

<i>It's all gonna work out, okay?</i>
Okay, bye.

[water running]

<i>Well, doesn't he seem
enthusiastic?</i>

[speaking Tagalog]
He just went for another run...

<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

Did you hear yet from the school?

<i>No, but I know
they're pinning it on him.</i>

<i>The other kid only got
suspended for two weeks.</i>

What?! That's all?

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>But, hey,
I wanted to let you know</i>

<i>I'm going to be staying
with Gary for a while.</i>

What do you mean?

<i>In Dallas.</i>

[Evelyn speaking Tagalog]
So you're moving there?


What about Moe?

<i>I'm not going to
wait around anymore.</i>

<i>He broke the kid's nose.</i>

It was sport!

They were playing a sport...

<i>Yeah, and he sent the kid
to the hospital.</i>

<i>Amos is going to be expelled.</i>

<i>I think we should
just face up to that.</i>

He can't stay here...

What's he going to do?

<i>You figure this one out.
He's your responsibility now.</i>

[Evelyn speaking Tagalog] I can't right now.
They need me here...

<i>the truth, Evelyn.</i>

<i>Sorry, I have to go.</i>

[Evelyn speaks Tagalog]
[hangs up]

[breathing heavily]

[â™ª]

[mailbox opens]

Hey, just give me a minute.
I'll get your mail.


You out here staying
with the Regans for the winter?

Here. Mostly junk.

Thank you.

Um, the paper?

I almost missed you!

Rick, hey there!

I hear Clem's back.
[Susan] Yeah.

Come bother him sometime.

[car door closes]

[â™ª]

She fell last night.

You know, I thought
we were past that.

Yeah, it was quite a shock.

I guess we have to start
locking up again.

Once, we found her
down here by the ponds.

She only has a bruise.
Nothing's broken.

[inhales deeply]
Are you settling in okay?

Yes. The quiet has been
very, very nice.

The irony is,
with all Clem's insisting

that Mom wants to die at home,

I'm pretty sure she never
actually wanted to live out here.

It was Dad
who liked the isolation.

Speaking of, looks like I need
to make Clemy give him a mow.

That's where he's buried?

Yeah, he and my uncle.

But it's actually
just the marker right now.

The morgue transferred him
to the wrong place

and he got lost.

Can you believe that?

it's absurd, right?


Hmm. Well, besides the fall,
is she behaving herself?

Yes. It's been lovely
getting to know your mother.

Okay. And with my brother?

I don't see him much, so...

You probably won't.
Hmm.

You should have seen the way the two of
them were living before you got here.

The house was disgusting.

Clem and my mom
have a special understanding.

[â™ª]

[wind chime tinkling]

[car doors open and close]
[quiet chatter]

[bird screeching]
[Susan] You can't get up, Mom.

If you want to get out of bed,
Evelyn has to help you.

Okay?
Mom, that's why she's here.

[bird screeching]

Are you picking me up?

Are you listening, Mom?

You can't fall again.
It's very dangerous.

[bird screeching]

You're on Warfarin.

Your blood is very thin.

If you fall and cut yourself,

we won't be able to stop
the bleeding.

Blood thinners, Mom.

It could be very bad.

Has she been this bad all week?

Mom?

Mom?

Do you understand me?

Mom?

This is different.


There she is.

Can we get her up?

You want your chair, Dena?

No? Okay.

doing to her now?

Help, then.
[bird screeching]

Hush, Pepper!

Hey, sister.
She fell.

She was night wandering.
[bird screeching]

Oh, yeah?

[screeching continues]
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

Clem, where were you?

Shh, shh, shh...

Clem! Where were you?

Mama, you can't get up.

You know that.
You know better.

There was a boy
in your room.

Oh, yeah?

He was colored.


That's Evelyn's nephew, Mama.
He's visiting.

Well, th... someone
is takin' my things, Clem.

They took my charivari.
[Susan] Mom, are you listening? This is really important.

They took my charivari.

I told him.
[Susan] I cannot be driving back and forth to Houston...

[conversation continues
indistinctly]

What's up?

Just a little dizzy.

You went on another run?

What else am I supposed to do?

You have to eat.

I don't like that stuff.

I'll make you something else.

Mom say anything about school?

your workbooks so you don't fall behind.

Yeah.

[suspenseful music]

[bird cawing]

When that's up, the doors lock
automatically, both inside and out.

That's this for the front and
back, and this goes to the garage,

and this opens
all the doors upstairs.

Clem's got copies of these,
and you can make copies of these.

[Evelyn] <i>Okay.</i>
[Susan] <i>Keep all the doors closed.</i>

<i>And wherever you don't want the
old broad needs to be locked.</i>

<i>Keep it locked, lock it behind
you, especially at night,</i>

<i>when the sundowning's
getting bad, okay?</i>


[smoke detector chirps]
[Dena, faintly] No.

I'm scared, Clem.

I'm scared all the time.

I wish you hadn't told me.

[continues indistinctly]

[smoke detector chirps]
[conversation continues]

[Dena's voice continues]


Forget I said anything.

[continues indistinctly]


Baby, please, just...
[continues indistinctly]

[smoke detector chirps]

[crickets chirping]

[woman speaking Tagalog]
My daughter...

She's right there...

I see her...

[static screeching
over intercom]


[woman speaking Tagalog]
Tell me how you are doing that.

My daughter senses you...


[woman speaking Tagalog]
Come on, answer me, Old Man...


[high-pitched ringing]

[chatter on TV]

[smoke detector chirps]

I'm sorry.
Did you say something, Dena?

Where did Clem go?

I don't know.



Did you need anything?

I'm fine, dear.

I'll just get the mail, then.


[TV chatter continues]

[Rick] How they doin'?
[car door closes]

[Evelyn] Excuse me?
The Regans.

Oh! Oh, very well, thank you.

You better tell Clem he better call
some of his high school buddies.

We're starting to think he's getting
a little high opinion of himself.

this belongs to us.

Say, do you know
this gentleman?

I swear I've never seen
another Asian around here,

but he gets mail
from time to time.

Have a good weekend.

[door closes]

[soft pounding]

[paper rustling]

Well, it's not the breaker.

Clemy.


She's still not eating.

Oh! Mama, you gotta eat.

Come on, a PB and J.
It's your favorite.

It's the blood thinners.

[Dena] Clem.
Yeah?

My charivari was in my...

It's not there
where I used to keep it.

What is that, Dena?

A charivari is like a little...

it's a charm bracelet
or somethin'.

You ain't gotta worry
about that, Mama...

I have a silver one.
It was your father's.

We'll find it for you.

It's bad luck without it.

Mama, that's not true.

I'd like to ask that young boy.

Mama, I said I'll find it
for you.

Leave it at that.
I'd like to talk to him.

I... I don't think...
No, let me talk to him right now.

[distant thunder rumbling]
[rain pouring]


a... a little silver...

in my jewel box.

Now, I know it's pretty,
but I need it.

I don't need the compact

and I don't need
seniors' things,

but my charivari I need.

I didn't take anything.

We know you didn't.

It's okay if you did,
but I need it.

Mama...

he doesn't know where it is.

Phone keeps going out.
Sorry.

[dishwasher door creaks]

you should apologize to.

He seems like
a pretty good kid.

He could be.

He's in a tough spot right now
because of his boxing.

He boxes?
He wants to.

[smoke detector chirps]

[suspenseful music]

Can I move this stuff?

Sure, just...
just stash it somewhere.

A while ago, Dena...

uh, she made me
take everything off the walls.

Uh...

will you keep an eye out
for the charivari?

<i>I just want to come home.</i>

[Anita over phone] <i>I know,
Buster, but you can't right now.</i>

<i>Listen...</i>

<i>a bad thing happened to her,</i>

<i>and there's something
she needs to tell you.</i>

Mom...
<i>Yeah?</i>

Nothing.

<i>What?</i>

You know you'll always
be my mom.

[chatter on TV]
[rain pouring]

How'd we do on last week's?

[suspenseful music]


[Dena talking indistinctly]

Why, Clem? Why?

This is something I don't...
[continues indistinctly]

I don't understand
why you'd do this.

All those children!

[continues indistinctly]

No, please, don't!
I won't shut up anymore!

[thuds]
[Dena groans]

[Dena coughing]

I hate you.

I hate you!

I don't understand
why you would do this.

I hate you for doing this
to our family.

You're a sick man.

No, please don't.
I won't shut up anymore.

I'm gonna tell everyone!

No, I won't be quiet!

All those children!

All those children!

All those children
will never stay quiet!

He won't stop!

Hey, what happened?
[door opens]


[door closes]
[Clem] You okay?

[Evelyn panting] Moe!

What happened?

I don't know.
He... he fainted.

Oh, my God, are you okay?

I blacked out.


What's the matter?

I've just been dizzy a bunch.

There's something wrong
with this place.

too hard.

[soft music]

<i>where you're from?</i>

I don't think about it much.

[water trickling]

I miss some things.

My mom's house,
it was always full of people.

Where I'm from, you don't call
before, you just come over.

Her kitchen
was always full of...

it was always full of family.

[water trickling]

Are your parents still with us?

No.

[sighs deeply]

My father left when I was young.

I lost my mom last year.

Should I put powder on this?


Were you with your mother
when she went?

I couldn't leave the States,

so my sister and I,
we paid for a nice funeral.

[sighs deeply]

Dena...

who are you talking to at night?

What?

The other night,
when I came in,

you were talking about a man
and you were very upset.

Here?

I was?

Oh! [laughs]

Oh, dear!

Sister, it's me again...

Please call back...

I can't think...

Um... [clears throat]

What does...

What does Amos know?

He won't look me in the eyes anymore...

[beeps]
[phone and power turn off]

[Dena groans]

Clem?

Patched the tire.

Should last a while now.

[tap running]
The power's out again.

It's not the breaker.

Try some sugar.

[â™ª]

Thanks.

I was thinking about...

maybe taking Amos
out on the boat.

I... I thought you were
gonna go to town.

I made you a list.

We can go tomorrow.

No, I would rather
he finish his schoolwork.


You know...

I'd check in on that
if I was you.

I'm gonna go see
about the power.

[muffled thudding]

[chatter on TV]

You haven't done any of these.

None.

So? [sighs]

It doesn't matter.

Maybe you just want to be dumb.

Maybe you just are dumb.
Do you think anybody gives a shit if I do any of this?

They don't.

I can't pretend to do that.


I know you're not my aunt.

[suspenseful music]


[muted chatter]

[suspenseful music]

[suspenseful music continues]

[knife chopping]

What's that?

It's dinner.

Can I help with anything?

You can have a seat.

You want some coffee
or somethin'?

Coffee would be good.

Uh, no, you don't have to do...
Don't worry about it.

[coffee pouring]

How's your head?

Still... [sighs]

fuzzy.

[knife chopping]

[flatware clattering]

What, you don't like it?

He doesn't like fish.

I do.


I suppose you like it better with
all the chemicals they put in it

from the supermarket.

Yeah, they want you to get
used to the taste of chemicals,

so you forget
what real meat tastes like.

That's not true.
That's a true story.

Hmm-mm.
Did you know they pump

supermarket meats
full of carbon monoxide?

It's true.

Keeps it all red.


Real meats turn brown,
you let 'em sit out for too long.

[imitates water drip]

[Dena groans]

Oh, my God.
[Dena grunts]

Dena, what are you doing?

Holy shit, Mama!

Dena, can you hear me?

We have to sit you down.
I can hear him.

We're right here, Dena.
Let's sit you down.

I can hear him.

Where's that coming from?

Shit!

Moe, get my kit by the bed.
Now!

I'm right here, Dena.

It's the blood thinners.

We have to clot
the bleeding now.

in the walls, Clemy.

Mama, you gotta relax.
Go check the top left drawer.

Hold this. [panting]

Top, top left.

I don't want this anymore.

[Evelyn panting]

[water running]

<i>She make you afraid of dyin'?</i>

But I have a faith
that guides me.

What about you?


Waitin' for her to die
has been somethin' horrific.

But, nah, I ain't afraid
of anything anymore.

Anymore?

I hope it's okay to ask
about your father.

When did he pass away?

I'm sorry to ask.

I feel like I should know.
Dena doesn't say anything.

Maybe she doesn't want to.

I'm sorry.


[sighs deeply]

[soft music]

[rain pattering]

[thunder rumbling]

[knock on door]

[rain pattering]

Hi.

Hi.

Come in.

Here, have a seat...

if you like.

You know, I just got back
from Afghanistan.

I... I didn't know.

There was this kid there
with us, didn't quite fit in.

Had narcolepsy.

Maybe he's a little off,
you know.

He would fall asleep?
Yeah.

Yeah.

So, you ever met
a narcoleptic dog before?

No. Is it a joke?

No.

I had this dog
when I was a kid.

She was narcoleptic.
She'd fall asleep all the time.

You throw a ball for her,
and she'd be runnin' hard after it,

tail waggin', all happy...

fall over sideways, snorin'.

[mock snoring, laughs]
[chuckles]

Our unit didn't treat him
too good.

That kid
I was tellin' you about.

Oh, right.

What happened?

One night,
things got out of hand.

He got beat up pretty bad.

Few of the others,
they... took advantage.

Officer asked me what happened.

I...

I didn't say a thing.

Not one word.

And the kid, he was...

too ashamed.

He killed himself?

No.

He was back on patrol
pretty quick after that.

I was on point,
checkin' for IEDs,

you know, roadside bombs.

He was maybe, you know,
here... here to the house.

Stepped on one.

I woke up in some hospital
a month later in Germany.

I'm sorry.

But one thing
didn't lead to the other.

You going to do this?

Should I?

What about Dena?

My sister'll take care of her.

I could make some good money.

Yeah, looks like it.

[sofa creaks]

Enough to eventually support
some other people, I bet.

[â™ª]

I was thinkin' about gettin'
my own place soon.

Maybe.

Somethin' I've been
thinkin' about recently.

The shrapnel entered my groin and my
left thigh in 24 different places.

I don't know what you're lookin'
for, what you want, but...

I won't be able to...

There's... there's no tone.

His pulse is fine.
Help me.

Phones are down.
Help me, help me.


He'll wake up in a second.

Moe?

Moe? [crying]

I'm sorry, we have to leave.

Um, I... I'm going to pack.

We... can you get his stuff?

No.

No. The hospital's too far away.

And with the phone line down...

Let me... I'll drive to the post
office, call the doctor.

He'll be here in ten minutes.

Ten minutes.

I'm not sure.

Sometimes I know he did.
I'm certain of it.

I have these dreams, you know.

But when I wake up...

I'm not so sure.

I shouldn't have hidden his key.

I was scared.

That's not a secret
anyone should keep.

[zipper slides]

I had this plan...
[items clattering in drawer]

I wasn't ever gonna
come back here.

But then you showed up.

Amos and I have to go now.

You don't have to go.

Well, I'm sorry,
we need you to stay.

[receding footsteps]

[soft music]

[keys jingle]

[suspenseful music]

[Evelyn] Wai...
[lock clicks]

Hey!

[rattling doorknob, banging]


[rattling doorknob]
Clem!

Hey! Clem!
[pounding on door]


[soft music]

[fire crackling]

[tense music]

I was so ashamed when they said
you were going to be born.

Everyone said you were better
off in America with Anita.

Maybe they were right.

I was afraid
I couldn't take care of you.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.



[somber music]

[woman speaking Tagalog]
My daughter...

Hear me...

The door is open...

[wind blowing]


Are you okay?

I think so.
Okay.

I need you to go to the post
office and wait for me there.

Okay.

Can you make it?

I think so.
Okay.

Okay, go. Go.

[woman speaking Tagalog
over intercom]

[woman speaking Tagalog over intercom]
My daughter...

Why won't you hear me?


Why won't you listen?

[dramatic music]


Dena, get up.

Dena?
We have to get up.

I have to get you... I can't carry you.
[Dena] Oh, Clem.

No, no.
We'll come back for him.

Oh... Oh, Clem.

[breathing heavily]

[paper rustling]

[heart beating faintly]

Why did you take
the blood thinners?

Huh?

Why?

I'll send somebody.

[breathing deeply]

[â™ª]

[Dena murmuring, sobbing]

I'm sorry.




[woman speaking Tagalog]
They say I can go now...

But everything's clear now,
Mr. Sanzaru...

Your people won't let you go...

[high-pitched screeching]
[wings fluttering]

[dramatic music]
