[Man On Radio]
Good morning, Los Angeles.
Mike Horn on CRN.

It's another fine
sunny day in the Southland.

Traffic's flowing
and so is the blood.

Today's topic is violence.

How do you feel about violence?
Have you been
personally affected by it?

Have you ever been tempted
to go over the edge
and hurt someone?

Do you think violence is
overrated, or should we all
be wearing protection?

I don't mean
the sexual kind, no.

I'm talking
bulletproof outfits.

What do you think?
We want to hear from you,
our listening audience.

Call CRN now,
and let's know what you think.
You're on the air.

Hi, Erin.
You have a nice voice.

What do you think
about violence?
I think it's awful.

We should be able
to live together
without killing each other.

But we've returned
to the Middle Ages, and we're
all behaving like animals.

Erin. What do you think
we can do about it?

Well, we need to have people
talk to one another.

Problem solving through
an open and active dialogue on
the issues confronting us all.

a little too much like
a psychologist today, Erin.

Jimmy, are you there?
You're on CRN.

Hey, dude, what's happening?

Where you calling from, Jimmy?
Sunny Santa Monica, man.

Hey, Mike,
I love your show.

[Man On Radio] Unidentified
man went berserk last night,
opening fire with a 12-gauge...

[Channels Switching]
I grew up here.

I mean, it's just not
happening like they say it is.

Thanks for calling, Jimmy.

Next caller,
you're on CRN.

I don't think we live
in particularly violent times.

Look at the past.
They were far more brutal
and uncivilized.

we've seen a decline
this century?

Oh, maybe. But I really don't
think the average citizen is
likely to experience violence.

[Mike] How so?
[Channels Switching]

[Woman] ...on acquaintances.
[Mike]
What are you talking about?

Haven't you heard about
the drive-bys, robberies and
homicides committed every day?

You're on CRN with Mike Horn.
I hope you're a bit more
connected to reality. Hello?

We want to hear from you.
Yes, you're on CRN with
Mike Horn. Hello.

I feel violence is
way out of control.

How would you rectify
the situation, sir?

I'd get all the guns
off the streets.

But that means amending
the Constitution.

That's not going to happen,
not in our lifetimes, anyway.

You're a victim too...
A victim of delusion.

[Gun Cocking]

[Man]
Everybody, down!
This is a robbery!

Get the fuck...
Get the fuck down!

[All Screaming]
Everyone, move it!

[Screaming, Shouting]


Give me the money now, now, now!

[Machine Gun Firing]

Get the fuck...

[Woman Screams]

[Woman On Radio]
459-C in progress.

Bank of America
at Victory and Laurel Canyon.

All units respond.
Code 3.

This is Morgan. We copy.
We're on the way.

E.T.A., five minutes.

Out.

[Engine Revs]

[Siren Wailing]

[Men Shouting]
Move it, move it, move it!

Move it!
[Woman Screams]

Open the goddamn safe!
Jesus!

Move it, move it, move it,

Go! Go!

[Sirens Wailing]
[Tires Squealing]

[Gunfire Continues]

Everybody, get down,
and you won't get hurt!


What the fuck
are you lookin' at?
I'll fuckin' kill you!

[Man On Radio]
Dispatch. Officer down.
Officer needs help.

I repeat:
officer down.

[Shouting,
Screaming Continue]

Put the money
in the fucking bag, you bitch!

Now, now!
Move it, move it!
I'll fucking kill you!

I'll kill you!

[Grenade Ring Clinks]
Pineapple for ya!

Vasquez!
I hit him six times...
didn't faze him!

Stay down, Chang!
They've got body armor!

Go for the head or foot!

Come on, motherfuckers,
give me your money!

Get down!
Get down!

Somebody's gonna die!
Is it you? Is it you?

[Men Shouting]

[Tires Screeching]


Okay, okay.

Ray...
Ray, I can't breathe.

Somebody get me a medic!


[Gagging, Coughing]

Tell my wife...

Get me a medic now!
Hurry!

[Machine Gun Fire]

Ted!
Hang in there, buddy!

Goddamn it!

Morgan, are you nuts?

Get the fuck out!
Move it, move it, move it!

Let's go!
Nobody move!
Everybody, stay down!

[All Shouting]

Welcome to hell.

What's your situation,
Vasquez?
From bad to shit.

We got four or five perps
in the bank with assault weapons
and body armor.

We can't fire into the bank...
There's hostages in there.

Where's SWAT?
En route.

Meanwhile I got guys down
all over the place out here,
and I can't even get to them.

You stay put...
until SWAT gets here. Huh?


Shit! Cover me, man.

So much for staying put.

Wake up!

Hey, princess.
You okay?

I'm scared.
I want to go home.

Okay. I'm here to take you home.
Come on. Let's go.
No. [Whimpers]

It's okay.
I'm a police officer.

Let's go.
I'm gonna take you home.
It's gonna be all right.

Keep your head down.
Come on. Let's go.

It's all right, honey.
Good girl.

That's it.
Come on, baby.
Mommy, I love you.

That's it.
Keep your head down.
Good girl.

Good girl. Good girl.
Good girl.


Take care
of the kid for me.

It's gonna be all right, honey.
It's gonna be all right.

[Sirens Wailing]

[Grunts]
[Tires Screech]

Freeze!

Drop your gun!
Put your hands in the air!

Hands up!

Now turn around, slowly!

Jesus Christ.

He's just a kid.

Where's the other gun?

He didn't have one.


[Machinery Whirring]

on these very streets,

A teenage boy was gunned down
by local police.

He was allegedly
a bank robbery suspect...

Who had been running from
the officers who shot him.

Authorities say he was
considered armed and dangerous,

But he had dropped
his weapon before he was shot.

Now, we have some home video
taken by a witness
during the incident.

But I have to warn you,
it is very violent...

And very graphic.

It appears that five
police officers...

Fired several rounds
at the suspect...

Who seemed to be trying
to surrender at the time.

He was pronounced
dead on arrival...

At Saint Joseph's Hospital
at 2:00 this afternoon.

Four other armed men
were also killed...

In the attempted bank robbery,

Which resulted in one of the
biggest and bloodiest shoot-outs
in L.A. history.

Fred Garfield,
Channel 11 News,

In Downtown Los Angeles.

[Tape Rewinding]

It appears that five
police officers...

Fired several rounds
at the suspect...

Who seemed to be trying
to surrender at the time.

[Tape Rewinding]

fired several rounds
at the suspect...

Who seemed to be trying
to surrender at the time.

[Tape Rewinding]

Who seemed to be
trying to surrender at the time.

He was...
[Tape Rewinding]

Trying to surrender
at the time.

You all know
that a civilian videotape...

Of this incident
has surfaced in the media.

The only thing you have to say
to any reporters right now
is "no comment."

Internal Affairs
is gonna investigate this
till we're blue in the face.

Detective Morgan,
you were the senior officer
at the scene.

Describe what happened.

Detectives Vasquez, Chang,
Grant, Boorman and myself...

Initiated a pursuit
of the suspect, sir.

And the suspect turned with
what appeared to be a weapon?

After several verbal warnings,
yes, sir.

And you state that
his heavy body armor...

Was the reason
for excessive force...

In your attempt
to neutralize the suspect.

Yes, sir.

Who fired the killing shot?

Somebody needs to answer
the chief of detective's
question now.

We all fired, Captain.

And we can't be certain
whose bullet actually...
It was my shot, sir.

He can't say that.
You can't say that, Morgan.

We all shot at him.
All right. All right.

I want you all to go home.
Take a day.

Make sure your head is clear
for your interviews.

Hey, Morgan,
why did you do that?

There's no way
you can be 100% certain
that that was your shot, man.

I wish I wasn't sure.

We're supposed to be
out of here.

You okay?

I will be.
Let's take the families
out of town for a day.

I can't. Jeremy's got
soccer practice today.
And then what?

We'll see.
Guaranteed brownie points
with the wives.

You got any information
on that kid in the shooting?

No. He's, uh,
still a John Doe.

Come on, man.
Let's get out of here.

[Children Playing]

Come on, Dad,
play soccer with us.

Later.
Come on! Please?
Please, please.

Jeremy, I told you
to leave your father alone
for a while.

Come on, Mom.
No, I mean it.

It's okay.

So you score a couple of goals
and you think you're PelÃ©
all of a sudden, huh?

I'm faster than you,
old man.
Oh, really?

Can you do this?
No.

When are you
gonna learn this, huh?

Santa Barbara?
Excuse me?

Tonight?

Let's go tonight.
Let's just take the kids.
They can miss a day of school.

Hmm?
You're as bad as Lucas,
you know that?

You're such a homebody.

We've never
been there before.

And I heard
it's really romantic.

With two kids?
Mmm.

Elaine and Lucas
can watch the kids
for a while.

I don't know.

Ah, look at those lovebirds.

Reservations are made.

Reservations to where?

Reservations to where?
[Clears Throat]

Santa Barbara beach house.

So I'm not impulsive.
Do I get a say in this?

No.
You'd shoot it down.

Hi, sweetie.
Hello, Tina.

Vacation time.

Don't fight it.
You need to get away.

Think about it.
Sandy beaches,
bright blue ocean.

No TVs, telephones
or media frenzies.

Okay. You can quit it
with the sales pitch, Lucas.
I bought it already.

You're as bad as my wife.
This is a conspiracy, man.

[Doorbell Rings]

[Doorbell Rings]

Mr. Sloan.

[Whispering, Indistinct]

My condolences.

You... You go to hell, Brown!

You killers!

What the hell do you know
about condolences?

Get the hell
out of my house!

You get out now!

Vincent,
look at me.

He was our baby.

You threw him out
into the streets.

You drove him
into that gang.

You...

Julia,

He had his choices.

I offered him a place
in this family.

He chose not to stay.

He could've stayed,

But only under your terms.

Everybody has to live
under your terms.

Or you destroy them.

Even me.

Julia.

Marcus was my son.

He's dead, Vincent.

Please, promise me,
no more killings.

Please.

It never ends.

[Footsteps Approaching]

I want you to bring
my cop up here tonight. I want
the information... all of it.

And no excuses.

Let go! It's mine!

It's my turn.
Would you both please be quiet.

It's my turn!
It's my game!

Is it her turn?
She's outside the lines!

No, I'm not.
You don't even know
how to draw.

Look!
She's doing it again!

Just give it to her.
Mom!

No! Not another word.

You wanted kids.

Three fives.

Sixes?
You always roll sixes.
I'm getting killed here.

So don't attack Greenland.
Now, now, dear.
It's only a game.

That kid's a little
Attila the Hun.

Yeah, he's a real backstabber.
Hey! You guys
are sore losers!

bringing up my Ukrainians...

To wipe you out.

I'm in Scandinavia,
and you promised you wouldn't
attack there.

All's fair
in love and war, baby.

Come and get it then,
Mr. Snake Eyes.

So who's winning here?
[Together]
I am!

Cassidy is such a sore loser.

So is somebody else
that I know.

I have no idea
who you could be talking about.

Who got sent to the kitchen
for time-out
last time we played?

Thanks for sharing that
with everybody.

What are you doing?

Daddy, look.
That wave looks like a dolphin.

You're right.
I see it. It does.

And, look!
That one looks like a whale!

Looks like a bunch
of seaweed to me.

Michelle, go help your mom
with dinner, okay?
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mr. Cassidy.

Bye, sweetheart.

Come on, big guy.
Let's walk.

That Michelle's
got quite an imagination.

She's a sharp kid.
She takes after her dad.

Who, the mailman?

[Morgan Laughing]

So vast, man.

It's like looking
into eternity.

I never tire of it.
That's way too
profound for me.

Ray... Ray, you okay?

Yeah.

Man, you have to
forget about that kid.

I can't.

We were doing our jobs.

You have to get past it, Ray.
There are people out here
who care about you. Like me.

We'll make sure
you get through it.

I promise.
Okay?

Thanks, man.

I wonder where his parents are.

[Doorbell Rings]

Devon, Andrew, Nicholas...

I want you to pay attention.

Look at these faces.
These are your targets.

No fuckin' mistakes.

Okay?
Okay, Pop.

Mr. Sloan, are you sure you
want your sons here...

Effective warriors
though they are...
to be involved in this?

You know, Mr. Brown,
at this point I don't think
that's your concern.

This is family business. Okay?

Detective Jesus Vasquez,
10-year man, vice cop.

Sergeant David Chang,
charity hound...
real do-gooder.

Officer Michael Grant,
rookie beat cop.

Officer Alex Boorman,
four-year veteran,
lives in Simi Valley...

Got a soft spot
in his heart for hookers.

Detective Ray Morgan...
says it was his bullet
killed Marcus.

Now, listen up.

Five men killed your brother.

They're all equally responsible.

If he died fightin',
I could live with that.

But they killed him
like a dirty dog.

Tomorrow, they all die.

You got it, Pop.

Andrew!

Let's go.

Don't worry, Pop.
We'll take care of it.
All right. Good, good.

Hey, Mama, you look great.
Thank you.

Get rid of the evidence.
I don't want anybody
connect me to my son Marcus.

Pray, Vincent.
Pray for the soul
of your son.

Pray for the souls
of all the men whose lives
you condemned tonight.

They're somebody's sons too.
Julia, please,
give me a break, will ya?

Pray for their families,
their children, their mothers.

Julia, listen.
I saw my mother cry
plenty of times.

When I was nine years old,
I buried three of my uncles.

When my father took a bullet,
I became head of this family.

You knew that
And when somebody kills a Sloan,
they pay.

Is that what
you told your God.

Oh, J... Julia.


[Hinges Squeaking]
[Woman Moaning]

Oh, yes.

[Dispatcher On Radio,
Indistinct]

Let's take a little time
to investigate, huh?

We could do something
better than this today.
We got time.

We got plenty of time.
You think she's over here?

I've got a good hunch
she's right in there.

Probably her little love truck
right there.
Let's get on it.

[Moaning Continues]

How many times this month, huh?
I don't know. I wonder
who she got in here this time.

Five bucks
says he's a doctor.
Five bucks he's a lawyer.

Bet.
I knock, you open.

All right.
[Moaning Continues]

Ooh-wee!

[Sighs]
Peaches, aren't we out
a little early for business?

Ah, come on, Michael.
I'm just trying to make
a living here.

Walk around the block
a few times, and I promise
I'll give you a freebie later.

If I wasn't a cop, I'd take
you up on that. But I am.
You know what I gotta do.

Oh, come on.



Watch out, Jack!


My name's Devon.
You killed my brother.

Say good night, Chang.


What the fuck?

Shit!

[Children Playing]

Focus, guys.
Focus on the job.

Hold it, guys. Hold it.
Three dead.

Christ!
Get him out of here.

Chang?
Yeah.

Shit.

Did anybody get the
video surveillance tapes yet?

I don't know.
What do you mean,
you don't know?

Those tapes should've
been secured.
Captain!

I'll take care of it.

Commissioner has arrived.

Sorry.

Shit.

Yeah.
Puttin' it down right now.
Right. Okay. Keep going.

Hey, close the door!
I'll get back to ya.

Captain, what is it?
Shut up and listen!

Four officers
were hit this morning.
All D.O.A.

Boorman, Grant, Vasquez
and Sergeant Chang.

Shit, they gunned Chang down
in the squad room
and just walked away.

That's the four officers that
were involved in the shooting
of the kid.

I'm surprised
you're still alive.

Yeah,
we took a last-minute trip.
That saved your life.

We I.D. the kid yet?
No. We got positive
confirmation on identities...

On all the other suspects
in the bank heist, but it's like
that kid dropped out of the sky.

Yeah, and somebody's makin'
heavy payback on him
specifically... somebody big.

You're the only
officer witness left.

We'll put you
in the protection program.
No way, Captain.

No what?
I want this case!

Ray!
I went to the academy
with Vasquez.

I went to his wedding.
I played soccer with Chang.

Cassidy.

Talk some sense
into your partner.

Somebody's put
a bull's-eye on his forehead.

Yeah.

[Door Closes]

Tina, I need you
and the kids to stay up there
for one more night.

I'm sorry.
I can't explain it right now.

I love you.
Tell the kids
I miss 'em, okay?

Yeah, bye.

Uh, Morgan?

I don't know how
this could've happened.

What?

Uh, well, the body
was cremated.

Yeah, it's an awful mix-up.
It was sent out mistakenly
last night to be cremated...

Instead of John Doe number two.
Who authorized that?

Chief of Detectives
Arnold Canton.

It's just
an unfortunate error, really.

He must have thought
it was John Doe number two
goin' out.

Let me see
the file on the kid.

Uh, well,
that's missing too.

Oh, great.
It's gone. Everything.

The dental records, the
blood workup, the photographs...
the whole file.

It's been stolen.

This kid's got long arms.

Somebody's trying very hard
to keep him anonymous.

Yeah.

I'm... I'm gonna
get some coffee.

We got six dead bank robbers...
five of them positively I.D.'d.

All small-time criminals
and petty thieves.

And the sixth is a kid
who's unidentified.

Whose file just happened
to disappear,

And whose body
was accidentally cremated.

We're dealing with
a highly organized
crime base here...

One that owns somebody
in the department.

And one that wants that kid's
identity concealed at all costs.

They're always one step
ahead of us, Lucas.

Problem is, who are "they"?

[Siren Blaring]

[Tires Squealing]

[Siren Continues]

[Tires Squealing]


[Radio Chatter:
Indistinct]

Think we'll find
his picture in there?

These files contain information
on every crime organization
in L.A.

He's gotta be
part of one of them.
But we need a photo.

We got plenty of photos.

Man, my eyes are tired.

Would you quit whining
and think of that
beautiful wife...

You got waiting
for you at home as soon
as we get out of here?

Got him.
You sure?

I'll never forget that face.

Sloan family.
Marcus Sloan.

Son of crime boss
Vincent Sloan.

Big daddy in L.A.
No wonder we're
catching so much heat.

Yeah.

What's up, Ray?

I know who
our John Doe is.
Who?

Vince Sloan's son.

Are you sure?

Yeah. It's Marcus Sloan.
Christ.

That explains a lot.

Don't tell anyone about this.

You know, there's an informant
inside the station.

The surveillance tapes
from the shooting
have disappeared.

Any suspects?
Yeah.

Chief of Detectives Canton
is under investigation.

Keep that under your hat.

Tell no one.

We're in with the sharks
on this one, Ray.

Jesus, we're in
with the great whites.

We have to proceed
with extreme caution.

What do you want me
to do, Captain?

Disappear, Ray.
Get your wife and kids
out of the city.

Hell, take 'em
to the middle of nowhere.

And then call me.
We'll figure out
our next move then.

You got it.

Shut the hell up, Nick,
all right?

Don't pull any of that
power-trip shit with me.

Jesus Christ, Devon.
Grow up. Maybe if you...

Please,
just chill out.
Stay out of this, Andrew.

Ass-kisser.
Boys!

Please.
Sorry, Mother.

We're all here to honor
the memory of my son Marcus,
as we truly knew him.

How should we remember him?

The way he was before,
or after...

You turned him
into a monster?

Julia, he turned on me.
It's always all about you.

Here we are...

Mourning my beautiful
little Marcus.

No body, no grave, no priest.

This is what your crimes
have done for him.

It's as if he never existed.
He exists in my heart.

You don't have a heart.

You had one once.

But it's been eaten away
by darkness.

[Canton] Sloan.
[Julia]
This is a funeral!

Honey, I'll be right back.
Wait. Please wait.

Oh, God.

What the fuck
are you doin' here?

We got a problem.
What is it?

That surviving detective,
Morgan...

He I.D.'d your son.
I want Ray Morgan dead.

Sloan.

I wasn't happy
with you hittin' Chang
at the station.

Gives us cops
a bad name.

That's too fuckin' bad.
Take a walk.

Daddy!
Dad!

Daddy!
Hey, guys.
How ya doin'?

Good.
When'd you get here?

Dad got home
late last night.

We have to let him rest.
No, I'm fine. What do
you guys want to do today?

Swimming!
Horseback riding.

Okay, how about we swim today
and horseback ride tomorrow?

Mm-mmm.
Fine.

What do you say, Mom?
Sounds good.

I missed you guys.

Yeah.
I missed you too, Dad.

Why did Elaine
and Lucas go back?

Because nobody's
after them,

And as far as anybody knows,
Lucas doesn't know
about Sloan,

So he can head up
the investigation
until I get back.

Well, I hope
that's not too soon.

I kind of like
having you around.

Oh, you do, huh?
Yes, I do.

I really do.

Daddy, I wanna go
to the mountains.

Too bad.
We're goin' to the desert.

You're both right.

We have to go
through the mountains
to get to the desert.

We're almost there, guys.

It was so great to see Elaine
and Lucas, wasn't it?

Uh...

We have to do it more often.

We will.
Promise?

Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I promise.

[Tires Squealing]


[Tires Squealing]
[Tina]
Kids, get down!

Stop! Daddy!
[Morgan]
We'll be all right.

[Tires Squealing]

[Gunshot]
[Screams]

[Tina]
Stay down!
[Tires Squealing]

[Loud Thump]


[Children Whimpering]
[Horn Honking]

Kids, are you all right?
Just hang on, okay?

It's gonna be fine.
[Horn Honking]

Oh, my God!
Christ!

[Both Screaming]

There's kids in that car.
Screw the kids.
Kill 'em all.

Daddy!

Come on, man.
My father's not gonna like this.

Morgan's mine.
I'm gonna get that bastard.

Ray!
[Children Screaming]

[Michelle Screams]

Ray!

Ray!

[Michelle Screams]
[Tires Squealing]

Make 'em stop!

Oh, I can't watch!

Hold my hand.
Don't let go.

Hang on.

[Tina, Children
Screaming]

No!

My God.
There were children
in that car.


Whatever.

Let's get out of here.

Ray.

Can you hear me?
Ray.

He's still comatose,
Detective Cassidy.

But he could still hear me.
That's what you told me
yesterday.

Yes, it is a possibility.

Father...
His eyes are moving.

Thank the Lord.

Ray, it's Lucas.

Ray.
He should be
in the hospital.

You should not have
taken him from them.

If I would have left him,
he would have been killed.

Lucas.

Thought we lost you
a dozen times.

Been in a coma a week.

Where am I?
In the Holy Innocence
Mission.

This is Father Navarro.

He used to be a doctor.

[Morgan Exhales]
They put a tracking device
on your car, Ray.

They knew where you were.

They took you to the hospital
after the crash.

But I knew Sloan
would find you there,

So I brought you here.

Lucas, the crash...

Tina and the kids...
Where are they?

I'm sorry, man.



No.

We still can't find Morgan.

Must be Cassidy, his partner,
who's also missing.

Cassidy must have slipped him
out of the hospital.

What the hell
am I paying you for?
He must be missing a week.

Nobody could have survived
that crash, Mr. Sloan.

Morgan did.

But you managed to kill
his wife and kids.

I strictly forbid that.

It was unavoidable.
Never have I been responsible
for killin' a kid.

Never.
Now get the fuck
out of my face.

Pop.

Nicky.

You here to stop me,
Father?

You have to stop yourself,
my son.

All I see is darkness.

All I feel is despair...

And hate.

Every man must choose
his own path, Ray Morgan.

Turn to God.

Ask him to show you
your path.

He will wait
until you are ready.


Ray?

We've already spoken,
Father.

Your friend Lucas
is here.

I fear
for your soul, son.

My soul?

I've lost my soul.

No soul is empty, Ray.

For two months I have
seen pain and hatred
eat you alive.

Pain will give way
to healing.

And hatred can give way
to forgiveness,

If you allow it.

Ray.

Let's walk.

I will keep
the candles lit
for your family.

Thank you, Father.

And for you.

[Bells Chiming]

Been hiding out
since the accident,

But I'm going back to town.

Elaine's in Corona,
at her aunt's house.

I have an apartment downtown
under an assumed name.

Here's the number.

Call me if you need me.

Otherwise,
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

Ray. We can bring Sloan down...
If we're smart.

I'll call Trent.
Assume everybody else
is dirty.

Watch your back,
partner.
Okay.


They tell me you haven't eaten
in three days.

Has Lucas called?

You know I would tell you
right away if he did.



Hello.
Elaine?
Is that you?

Ray.
You shouldn't be there,
Elaine.

Where's Lucas?
[Choking]
Ray...

Ray, Lucas...

Lucas is dead.

What?
I'm... I'm so afraid, Ray.
I don't know what to do.

Everybody thinks that
someone at the station
killed him.

Okay, Elaine, listen up.
This is what I want you
to do.

I want you to get out
of town.

Don't talk to anybody.
Don't tell anybody
that you've talked to me.

Get out of town.
Get as far away from there
as possible, okay?

Okay.

Ray, please...
Please be careful.



Captain Trent.

You're the only one who knew
where Cassidy was staying.

Morgan?
You're the only one who knew
I'd identified Sloan's kid.

And Lucas found
your tracking device
on my car.

No, no. You're mistaken, Morgan.

I'm coming for you, Trent.

You're confused.
Of course you are.

Where are ya?
I'll send out a unit.

You killed my wife,
my kids and my best friend,

And now you're gonna pay
with your life.

Morgan, now...
[Dial Tone]

Morgan.

[No Audible Dialogue]

The Lord forgives,
and so must man.

Father, I can't.

[Chattering, Laughing]
** [Dance Pop]

He's just having
a real tough time, and he
can't pay the payments.

Hey, I don't care if he doesn't
have the money, all right?

He's had more
than enough time to...

Hey! How you doin'?

You guys havin'
a good time?
I'll be right over.

Look. He's dead.
You understand me?

Hi, Papa.

Hi.
Hi! So nice to meet you.

God, he's so cute.
Oh, my God.
I couldn't tell you...

Hi. How are you?

You throw a beautiful party,
Pop.

Everybody's here.

So I'm dancin'.
I'm bouncin' off the walls.

Andrew's dancin'.
Nicolas is dancin'.
We're all sittin' there.

There's beautiful girls
everywhere. I start takin'
my clothes off.

Nicolas starts takin'
his clothes off.
All the girls...

[Gun Cocks]
[Morgan]
Just shut up,

And slowly walk
towards the front gate.

What the hell
is goin' on?
[Guests Clamoring]

He-yah!

No guns! No guns!
[Grunts]

[Sloan]
No guns!
[Clamoring]

[Both Grunting, Groaning]


[Glass Shatters]


[Clamoring Continues]

[Bones Crack]


Oh, Devon!


[Sirens Blaring
In Distance]

Oh, my boy!

[Sirens Continue]
[Wailing Continues]

[No Audio]

Forgive me, Tina.

[TV, Indistinct]

Sloan.

I expected you sooner.

Oh, your time's coming.

Do you dream when
you sleep at night, Sloan?

I don't. Not anymore.

No dreams, no nightmares.

Nothing. Just blackness.

Where the fuck
did he go?

Hmm.

He wants to kill me
and you.

You're our police captain.
You take care of yourself.
I want my boys protected.

I can promise both your
sons police protection.
Good.

And you, hotshot,
I want you to get Morgan.

I don't care how,
why or when,
but you just get him.

Consider it done,
Mr. Sloan.
Don't blow this.

Don't blow this.
Julia! Where you goin'?

Please, wait, honey.
Where you goin'?
Come on!

I will not stand by
and watch you
kill our sons.

Julia, you can't
blame me for that.

I have no control on this one.
Please, honey.
This is all your creation.

Julia, please. I love you.
Where you goin'?

What kind of a family
murders its own sons?

Julia!
It's over.

Your father's idea
for you to leave the country
is a good one, Andrew.

You'll be safe in Paris.

Yep.

I'll leave. I'll go.

Nicky's not gonna go though.

Nicky's not gonna
leave Daddy.

I'll leave.

I'm gonna stay alive.

And when Morgan kills everybody,

I'm gonna inherit
the whole thing.

[Siren Blaring]

[Tires Squealing]

[Tires Squealing]

[Both Grunting]


[Horns Honking]

[Horns Honking]

[Grunting Continues]

How much did Sloan
pay you to kill my family?

He paid me to kill you.
I whacked your family
for kicks.

[Horn Honking]

[Tires Squealing]

Oh, shit!

[Indistinct Conversation]

Okay, Pop.
Okay, it's just
me and you.

You and me.
I love you.

I love you too, Pop.

Hey. Where the hell's
Canton?

I don't know.
He survived the attack
that killed my kid.

Where the hell is he?
He never came back
to the station.

All right, listen.

Tomorrow you go back
to work at the factory,
like nothing ever happened.

Okay, Pop.
Mr. Sloan,
that would be suicide.

We'll be there.
When Morgan shows up,
that'll be the end of it.

Why would Morgan
walk into a trap?

Because he's destroying
my family, just like
I destroyed his.

He'll be there.
He can't wait.

Mr. Sloan?

Ah. Just the guy
I been lookin' for.
I was hopin' I could explain.

I understand.
It wasn't my fault.

Tell me the truth.
Did you ever see
a view like that?


Okay, boys, let's go.
We got work to do. Now.

[Michelle, Jeremy Laughing]

Daddy!
Dad!

[Jeremy's Voice]
Come on, Dad,
play soccer with us.

All the workers
have gone home.

Every man on the floor
is one of ours.

Good.
Everything okay
with you, Nick?

I took care
of my end, Pop.

Everything's been checked out.
I'm bringing in...

We are going to
get this done right?
Absolutely.

I don't want any problems.
I'll go back and
double check everything.

I don't want
any trouble this time.
I want you to get it right.

[Sharp Groan]


[Bones Crack]

He-yah.

[Grunting, Groaning]

[Grunting, Groaning
Continue]

Hey-yah.

Christ.
What was that?

He must have walked
in the front door.

He's got nothin'
to lose, that's why.

Trent, you get the boys
and get that son
of a bitch now.

Now!

Nicky, stay down!
Let me get
to him, Pop.

Stay down.
Listen to me.

[Men Clamoring]

[Clamoring Continues]


Get Morgan.
He's coming up.
Okay, boss.



I'm gonna kill
that fuckin' bastard.


[Bones Cracking]

[Running Footsteps]

You take care
of your ma.

I'm gonna take care
of this guy myself.


Come on and get me,
you son of a bitch.


Shit!

You should be goin' for Sloan,
you dumb fuck!


[Bones Cracking]

God! Goddamn it!

Why?

[Bones Crack]





Price is right so...

[Whispering, Indistinct]

You take that way.
Keep...

He's around here
somewhere.


[Bones Crack]

Morgan!

Haven't you realized
you can't win?

You can never win.

I'm gonna kill you,
just like you killed
my brothers.

[Footsteps Receding]

Sloan!

[Screams, Groans]

Jesus. Morgan!

Do it! Do it, Morgan!

[Heavy Breathing]
Do it like I did
your wife and kids!

Do it!

Morgan!

Morgan!
