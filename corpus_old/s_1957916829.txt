[all chanting] Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho!

Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

[customers screaming]

[bank robber] We're here
to make a withdrawal.

fucking ho.

Santa wants
to know who's in charge

of these outrageous
overdraft fees.

Put the money in the bag.

My friends, this bank is
an institution of corruption.

What a good little girl.

Santa won't forget you.

This is what you worship,
your money.

This place only cares
about your money!

You wanna hurt them?

This is how you hurt them.

You take what's precious
to them.

Christmas is coming.

So, I wanna say,
"Merry Christmas, sheep,"

because you will unwrap
a present

which is the great liberation!

And it will destroy
this civilization

just like an earthquake
from the Book of Revelations!

[bank robber] Everybody get up!

Move! Up!

Move! Let's go! Move! Come on!

Go! Go! Go!

Hurry the fuck up!

of my mother.

I liked my mother...
[bank robber] Go!

...but I never forgave her
for bringing me in
to this horrible world.

Because you have been
such good boys and girls,

you can unwrap one gift early.

Merry Christmas.

[hostages chattering]

[hostages shouting, screaming]

[bank robbers chanting]
Ho! Ho! Ho!

[chanting continues]


men of law enforcement

have imprisoned the people of
this country for far too long.

It's time you learn
the true meaning of Christmas.

[car alarm blaring]

Kill them all.

[police chief sighs]

Our main priority
is IDing suspects.

We'll give the FBI
and the mayor's office
our full cooperation.

Understood?

Damn, we got hit today.

And we lost.

But as long as we are standing

and-- and we remember
what we're standing for,

we will always win.


They come at you with a knife,
you come at them with a gun.

They come at you with a gun,
I will--

Swear to God I will get you
a fucking tank.


I wanna see whoever did
this shit stand trial.

Are we clear?

Let's get to work.

[door buzzes]

[chattering through PA]

James Edward Knight.

Ex-cop.

Ex-husband.

Ex-military.

That's a lot of exes,
Mr. Knight.

Can appreciate that.

[prison worker] Mail.

<i>followed by stints as a cop</i>
<i>in both Newark and Los Angeles.</i>

<i>As many arrests</i>
<i>as you had citations.</i>

<i>Mr. Knight, you are a guest</i>
<i>in my fine establishment,</i>

<i>awaiting trial.</i>


There will be no
special privileges.

<i>You will be alone at night,</i>

<i>but during the day you will be</i>
<i>with general population.</i>

<i>There'll be no bullshit.</i>

<i>There'll be no gambling.</i>

<i>There will be no fighting.</i>

<i>I expect you to see</i>
<i>the preacher once a day.</i>

We are all God's children,
Mr. Knight,

but this is my house.

<i>Welcome home.</i>

Think you're gonna fit right in.

[prison worker] Mail.

District Attorney.

"Casey Rhodes, on behalf

of the public defenders office
we hereby

ask that you consider
the plea agreement set forth..."

[breathing heavily]

"Twenty-five years
incarceration."

[siren blares]


<i>has blessed us with Jaden.</i>

But now he has to go and walk
in the light.

And we offer
our congratulations.

Stand up, Jaden.
Come on. Get up.

Thanks, guys.

Hey,

you became a man in here, okay?

[grunting, groaning]

Fuck.

[prisoners chattering]

[line ringing]

Hello, this is Casey Rhodes

from the department
of absentee fathers.

No, no, no, babe, I'm so--

I'm sorry. I was trying
to be funny.

No wait.
Hey, come on. Gimme a sec.

Can-- Just put--

Do me a-- Just put Clara on
for a second. Put--

Babe, put Clara
on the fucking phone.

Put--

Darling, I get one--
two minutes here.

Come on.

All right, finally.



Here we go.

All right. Start here,
nighty-night.

[clears throat] Mmm, okay.


All right, I'll see you.
I raise you one.

The flippity floppity.



Well said. Good, good.
Can I join you guys?

Fuck off.


You wanna know what tough is?

Change.

Because change takes sacrifice.

Yeah.

You have to be free
in here first

before you can be free
out there.

Yeah, says the guy
peddling religion.

a religious man,

but I'm not selling religion.

I'm selling freedom.

Brother Rhodes,

what are you willing to do

to see your family
and be free again?

Anything.

I'd do anything.

You're a fucking drug addict,
Casey.



You're in hell right now,
brother.


I've been right where you are.

They tossed me in jail
and threw away the key.

All that pain.

All that rage.

Don't you waste it.

Let it purify you, brother.

Let it become your guiding star.

Think about your family.

Think about all the good
you can do for them.

And I promise you'll
rise again like a phoenix.

Greater than you've ever been.

I believe in you, Casey Rhodes.

Do you believe in yourself?


[breathing heavily]

<i>calling themselves</i>

<i>the real saints of Christmas</i>
<i>have claimed responsibility</i>

<i>for the spate of bombings</i>
<i>across New York City.</i>


[voices chanting] <i>Ho! Ho! Ho!</i>

[chanting continues]


Get on the ground!

Get on the ground and pray
to your favorite god.

You're gonna all be famous.

This is my present to you.

Merry fucking Christmas.

The great liberation is at hand,
and you are a part of it.

We're going--

[customers scream, gasp]

Get them up.
Get them in the vault.

Someone blast a hole
in those security cameras.

Get them in there.


But I'm not selling religion.

I'm selling freedom.


Stand up, Jaden.
Come on. Get up.


Brother, med, please.

My vision is clear...

[bank robber] Get in there.
Move! Move!

Get into the vault.

...because of your heroism
and your loyalty, brother.

But I've got no room
for dead weight.

What-- What happened
to no man left behind?

They left us all behind.

[hostages screaming]

[muffled screaming]



[police radio chatter]

[siren wailing in distance]
[nurse over PA] <i>Dr. Kravitz,</i>

<i>you have a visitor</i>
<i>in the main hall.</i>

[Fitzgerald sighs]

[phone vibrating]

[clears throat] What,
you in the Christmas spirit?

<i>You're gonna drop the charges</i>
<i>on my partner?</i>

'Tis the season.

<i>He did the right thing, Cap.</i>

Look,
I try and write him letters.

I try and call him.
He won't speak to me.

He won't let me tell him that--

He did what every partner
should do and had my back.

He ignored due process.

He desecrated
the oath he took.

<i>Yeah, Knight would call that</i>
<i>a good day's work.</i>

You following
the Christmas bomber?

What, you're gonna pin
all that shit on him too?

<i>I'm out of cards to play.</i>

FBI, CIA...


...nobody has any leads.

<i>We ran a gait analysis,</i>

<i>ran every shell fired</i>
<i>through IBIS.</i>

<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>This guy's a ghost.</i>

<i>But Knight has done more</i>
<i>with less.</i>

You and I both know

Knight would say yes
to joining the hunt.
<i>No, no, no.</i>

Knight has dedicated his life
to this job.

<i>He lost his wife,</i>
<i>his relationship with his kid,</i>

and his freedom.

And if he catches the bomber,

maybe he gets
one of those three back.

Don't turn him into a monster
just to catch a monster.

I got a city too scared
to leave their houses.

I got a madman blowing up banks
on Christmas.

<i>And I got a mayor that--</i>


No, no, no.
Finish that sentence.

What-- What about the mayor?

<i>Forget what I said</i>
<i>about the mayor.</i>

And don't you even think
about coming to New York.

Padre... [chuckles]
...what brings you down here?

Hi, Warden.
How's your night going?
Terrible.

Seems like it's a damn sight
better than yours?

You're very intuitive.
Yeah.

I don't know
what I'm doing out here
this time of night.

I know it's a mistake.


I had a dream.

Yeah, about the guys.

About some of the men
in prison. I was--

I just wanna check on them,
make sure they're okay.

You had a dream?
Like a-- Like a premonition?

Like a-- Like a vision.

So, what prisoner
are we dreaming about?

All of 'em.

All of them?
Yeah.

Yeah,
I know this was a mistake. I--

If they see me out here,
they're gonna think
something's amiss.

That's gonna create
all kinds of drama.
I didn't want that.

I think you're right there.
I think you're right.

Yeah. No.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

The security center.

I could look
through the monitors.

They wouldn't see me.
It would set my mind at ease.

I would feel so much better.

No.

Yeah, yeah. You're right.


Yeah?
Come on. It's Christmas.

Let's take a look, shall we?

Okay. [chuckles]

Yeah.
Let's take a look.

You're a good man.
I know.

All present
and accounted for.

Of course they are.

I run a tighter ship
than Lord Nelson ever did.

Now, Father Conlan,
what was your vision?

Oh,

I envisioned your death.


[PA squeaks]

[Conlan on PA]
<i>Can I have your attention,</i>
<i>my brothers?</i>

I bring you
great Christmas tidings.

[gate buzzes]

[prisoners cheering]

[Conlan on PA] <i>Today is</i>
<i>the beginning of the liberation.</i>

<i>So prepare yourselves.</i>

Hmm. [chuckles]


Let it begin.

[prisoners chattering]

[prisoners chattering, shouting]

[prisoner grunting]

Brother Rhodes?


Hey, man.

[both grunt]

You all right?

Yeah, yeah. [grunting]
Yeah.

[all grunting]

And unto you,
this day was born a savior.

And the wages of sin is death.

And freedom is a gift.

You have incarcerated
your brothers

which is not abided by--
by any other species.

So today,

I give the gift of freedom
to my brothers.

Because freedom is
their birthright.

Freedom is what we will take.

Merry Christmas, motherfuckers!

[prisoners chanting] Ho! Ho! Ho!

[chanting continues]

[chanting stops]

<i>Five guards are confirmed dead</i>

<i>and 42 convicts escaped</i>
<i>from New York's Rikers</i>
<i>maximum security prison tonight.</i>

<i>The police have released</i>
<i>a description of</i>
<i>one of the suspects.</i>

<i>Ricky Conlan, a former marine</i>
<i>turned prison chaplain,</i>

<i>who is also now being</i>
<i>sought for questioning</i>

<i>regarding the Christmas</i>
<i>bombing attacks</i>
<i>on the city's banks.</i>

<i>US marshals</i>
<i>have been dispatched...</i>

You can leave.

I thought you'd split
with the rest of 'em. [sighs]

A good bed is, uh--
is hard to find.

I need your read on a suspect.

Tell me what every cop
and profiler from Quantico
to Camp Perry isn't seeing.

His real name is
Richard Ricky Conlan.

Conlan was Special Ops.

Then he went rogue.

<i>He fought with his CO,</i>
<i>got court-martialed,</i>

<i>sentenced to seven years</i>
<i>in supermax.</i>

<i>While inside,</i>
<i>Conlan's son was killed</i>
<i>in action</i>

<i>and he was refused permission</i>
<i>to attend the funeral.</i>

Somewhere in there,
he discovered
his spiritual side.

Got out ten years ago.

Ever since,
Conlan's been working
as a prison counselor.

<i>Everyone we speak to says</i>
<i>he's a pillar of the community.</i>

Best thing since Mr. Rogers.

Now that he's been ID'ed,
FBI link him for 21 homicides,

eight armed bank robberies.

Never showed his face
before last night,

when he busted out your bestie,
Casey Rhodes,

and other hard-core degenerates.

Why didn't you break out?

I'm wasting my time here.

Whenever I had a tough case,
I remind myself one thing.

What?

Everyone bleeds.
You can't be saying
shit like that.

You are about to stand trial
for the murder of two suspects.

I killed more than two.

Okay, that is not something
to be proud of.

I killed some bad guys.

It was a good day.

Everyone has a right
to due process.

You swore an oath
to serve and protect.

I own what I did.

You're a disgrace.
You're a vigilante.

Why didn't you break out?

I'm a cop.

It's how I'm wired.

I believe in the rule
of the law.

You are not a cop.

You are a criminal
who had a badge

and thought it gave him
the right to do
whatever the hell he wanted.

I need your help.

I need you to pretend
to be a cop one more time.

I don't like you.

I don't respect you.

But you can do things
I cannot do.

In another life,

Conlan is you.

The drive,
the self-righteousness.


Stop Ricky Conlan

and the DA will drop
all charges against you.

Why me?

'Cause you could have broke out
with the rest of the guys
in your cell block

and you chose not to.

You chose to do the right thing.

You're no better
than the guys you killed
or locked up,

but there's still good in you.

And because you're
the only guy I know

who might be crazier
than Ricky is.

I am flattered.

But understand this.

He's not robbing banks.
He's putting on a show.

How do you know that?

Think like a criminal.

It tracks.

Any leads?

Wanna hear a bad joke?

Always.

When the last bank was hit
in Midtown,

someone had an appointment
with the manager

at the same time
and didn't show.

Guess who it was.
The pope?

Close.

Vassetti.
The mayor.

One and only.

Someone tipped him off.

Yeah.


Tell me I'm not
making the worst decision
of my life.

I wanna catch this guy.

Give me my gun,
and I'll do the rest.

Conlan comes to me alive.
Got it?

James Knight
versus a psychotic bank robber.

Let's hope
the city's still standing
come Christmas morning.

[piano playing]
[horn honks in distance]

like a lot of fun.

He's probably a Jets fan.


Look, I'm not really
into this cult shit.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

[Conlan laughs]
[piano stops]

How are the libations,
my brothers?

[Mercer whispers] Let's go.

Hear what he has to say
and leave?

When that man speaks,
you listen.

Dajon barks like a dog,
but he's a loyal one.

My brothers...

the time is upon us
for the great liberation.

But I ask you one small favor.

I ask you to trust.

Trust that together
we can change the world.

Trust that when we move as one,

that those sheep out there
will tremble in fear
at the sight of us.

There are more people
in prison in this country

than any other nation
on the planet.

74% of souls in cages
haven't even been convicted

of a crime.

They're in there
because they can't afford
to pay bail.

They can't even
pay their mortgage, their rent,

while their brothers
in their mansions laugh at them.

We're persecuting the poor.

It makes my blood boil.

And I was a soldier
for this country.

I spilled blood in countries
you can't even find on a map.

They asked me to execute people
who did not deserve to die.

And when I stood against them,
they threw me in a cage too.

Yes, they did.

And then when my son died
in combat...

[sniffles, sobs]

...I couldn't even see
my own son's body
be lowered into the ground.

Tell me that's not cruel.

Tell me that's not torture.

The corruption of this sick
and diseased civilization,

we have to wipe it out.

We have to burn their sick egos
to the ground

and raise this whole country
and start fresh and anew.

Look at this holiday.

Christmas. [laughs]

They've perverted
this holiday.

They've turned it into
a giant mall of consumerism.

We have to take it back.
We have to make it ours.

This blessed day
will no longer be corrupted
by their ugliness.

We will bring that change.

Because this is war.

And there will be no prisoners.

And when they think
of Christmas...

...they will think of us.

But those of you
who do not want to be here
for this great liberation...

...there's the door.

No offense, no disrespect,
but, uh, yeah, fellas, I'm out.
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

Pussy.

No, no, no. No, Dajon.
[door opens]

That man wants to be free.
[door closes]

And our gift to him
is his freedom.

Just make sure he finds
the right way out.

[door opens]
[footsteps recede]

Celebrate tonight, my brothers.

Tomorrow, we begin.

Brother Rhodes.

You're not drinking.

No. No, I'm, uh--

You know, I'm not thirsty, so...

Don't lie to me.

Don't lie to me
and don't ever cover for anyone.

Uh, Father, uh...

[clears throat]
A favor to ask you.
No.

Don't even know
what I'm gonna ask you.

You wanna call your family
and tell them you're okay.

No.

What if I make a trade with you?
[packet crinkles]

[Conlan laughs]

You've realized you're more
than your addiction.

Very good.

Make it quick.

Nice speech.

You'll have a nice day
on the swings.
It's gonna be so fun.

Yeah.

God.

Look,
stop following us, okay?

I don't know where Casey is.

Ugh. I'm sorry, honey.

It's okay.


Yeah.
Yeah?

Well, I had a nightmare.

Yeah?

Daddy never came home
because he was drowning.

I tried to save him,
but I couldn't.


I'm sorry, sweetheart.

Can I call him?

Not today.

There's gonna be no crying
in this household

over Daddy, okay?
[phone vibrating]

Okay.
Okay?

Mommy is getting a phone call.
But go-- go play.

Okay.


Hello?
<i>department of absentee fathers.</i>

Calling again.

Hi, Mom.

<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

How are you holding up?

Not great.

How is she doing?


<i>More questions every day,</i>
<i>wondering where her dad is,</i>

<i>and why I don't let her</i>
<i>watch the TV.</i>

Look, please don't tell me
that you're--

you're part of the jailbreak.

[Rhodes sighs]

I, uh, kind of got mixed up
in it, darling.

<i>I don't know how it happened,</i>
<i>but...</i>

...I couldn't spend
another day in that cell.

How could you be so stupid?

Pretty much used up
all the stupid
getting this far, huh?

They say the guy
who orchestrated the jailbreak
is-- is the Christmas bomber.

<i>Honestly, I'd rather you be</i>
<i>inside and alive than--</i>

Instead of what?

Dead?
Inside is pretty much
the same exact thing.

Ugh, God.

I just feel like you don't--
you don't think.

You don't think at all.
You don't fucking think.

No, I can fix this, darling.
<i>No, you can't.</i>

You can't fucking fix this.

You sound like an addict.
<i>I'm with Conlan right now, okay?</i>
<i>I can maybe cut a deal.</i>

I need you to call the police,
tell them what
I just told you, okay?

<i>I'm gonna text you</i>
<i>the address right now.</i>

<i>Don't give up on me, okay?</i>

I love you.

Prove it.

[cell phone beeps]

Casey Rhodes.

We had such high hopes for you.

What?

Put her through.

Mrs. Rhodes,
what can I do for you?

<i>Casey called me.</i>
<i>He's with the bomber.</i>

When did you talk to him?

<i>Just now.</i>
Did he give you an address?

<i>Look, I need your word</i>
<i>that all the charges</i>
<i>against Casey will be dropped.</i>

<i>Full immunity.</i>
I can say with confidence

that the mayor
and the DA's office
would be willing to cut a deal.

<i>Send me something in writing,</i>
<i>and I'll send you the address.</i>

[engine starts]

[people clamoring]


Oh, God. [groans]

[both grunt]

Hold it right there!


[handcuffs crank]

[helicopter whirring]


Conlan left 20 minutes
before we showed up.

He might have been tipped off.

<i>on the line for you.</i>

I got you out to get results.

His team prepped here.
They paid cash.

The landlord has no idea. None.

<i>They don't know where he is.</i>

Conlan is always one step ahead.

Do the Feds have anything?

<i>They know less than we do.</i>

<i>There's only one witness</i>
<i>that we haven't questioned.</i>

We cannot get
the mayor involved.

You said to do
whatever it takes.

This is what it takes.


All right, I'll--
I'll meet with him, okay?

You're a good one, Captain.

Don't I know it.

[cello playing "Deck the Halls"]

Hey, my son plays the cello.

Yeah, you're pretty good at it.
[cello stops]

No, no, don't--
don't stop, please.

You try playing for four hours.

Uh, that'll be a hard pass.

Exactly.

You a cop?

Why?

Fuck the police.

Charming.

[car horn honks]

we need to discuss
where you were last night.

We're gonna have
to have a conversation.

["Deck the Halls" continues]

[clears throat]

Welcome to my home, sir.

[clears throat]

Anyone thinking of donating
to the city,

well, is a friend of mine.

Ah, yeah.

Yeah, that was just a lie

so I was able to get
an appointment with you
on shorter notice.

I'm not even a constituent.

And I definitely wouldn't
vote for you.

But I do have this.

Los Angeles.

You're out of your jurisdiction.

And you're wasting my time.

And you're letting
a madman blow up banks.

So I guess you and I
have a lot to talk about.

[clears throat]

Man, I wish I had a seat
at your weekly poker game,

because you lie for shit.

Now, why did you miss
your appointment at the bank

the day that it was blowing up?

Midtown traffic.

What was the appointment for?

Hmm? What, you need a loan?

I was, uh,
looking to close out
my safety deposit box.

And Ricky Conlan beat you to it.

Hmm.
What was in it?

Nothing of importance.
Come on.

No blood diamonds?

No photos of you
in a little white robe
with a little pointy hat?

No.

Come on. What does Conlan have
on you, huh?

Video of you fucking the maid?

[cello stops]

Arthur?

Again, please.

Really sweet kid.

[cello playing resumes]

Well, I need to prepare
for my press conference.

Of course.
You gotta rehearse
all that bullshit.

Thank you
for your service, Officer.

Actually, that's "Detective."

I'm sorry
I couldn't be more help.

Oh, don't be sorry.

No, you were
a great deal of help.

After you.

[clears throat]
Oh, you know what?

No, ah,
there's just, um--

I just have one more thing.

Mm-hmm.
Do you still have
safety deposit boxes?

Now, why would you
want to know that?

Ah, just after Conlan's heist,
where did you move them to?

I consolidated them
into one location.

And where would that be?

An impenetrable bank.

Few know the actual location.

Consider it a Fort Knox
for the 1%.

Ah. Well, Mr. Mayor,

I think that you and I are
gonna be seeing
a lot of each other.

I look forward to it.

Good.


Oh, and, uh,

what's your wrist size,
Mr. Mayor?

I'd love to send you a nice
little fuzzy pair of handcuffs
for Christmas.

You can keep the itinerary.

Blow me.

[police radio chatter]

What the--

How'd you get in here?

Well, that's between me
and the door.

Get out from behind my desk.
I asked you a ques-- Oh.

You're in a wheelchair.

Bullets didn't hit my spine,
so if I stay off my feet,

I'll be up and running
by Memorial Day.

get in here?

Yeah, well, you're a detective.
You figure it out.

You flew all the way
from LA to New York
to bust into my office?

Oh, and I might as well
tell you now,

because you will find out.

I paid a visit to the mayor.

Man, I can't believe...
[cell phone pings]

...he's such a bad liar.
He's made it so far in politics.

Now he's messaging me,

asking me why some LA cop
is asking him questions.

Because he's involved.


This could be
the biggest scandal
in the history of the city.

I know Conlan's got
something on the mayor.

Let's just hope if
Knight finds out what it is,
he'll do the right thing.

Yeah, Knight will play
by the book.

I have a feeling his
definition of "by the book"

is to beat a guy to death
with a book.

Find anything on Conlan?

No.

He wants to rid the world
of money,

yet he is playing Santa Claus.

He does one thing, says another.

I think that he wants the world
to believe he's an animal.

So find out
who's holding the leash.

Yes, ma'am.

The first question is,
where is my partner?

You're a detective.
Figure it out.


Thank you all for coming.

I am putting Ricky Conlan
on notice.

We will apprehend you.

I am also putting
the police department

<i>and Captain Anna Shea</i>
<i>on notice.</i>

<i>I will come after you</i>
<i>if you fail in your directive.</i>

[voices chanting, echoing]
<i>Ho! Ho!</i>

<i>some sort of Robin Hood.</i>


[all scream]

Merry fucking Christmas!


You understand the problem?

You wanna see my face?
Look at me, motherfucker!

Don't move!


He's a criminal
of the lowest kind.

I am here to save you!

Look at this god
you worship. Stand up.


You wanna worship money
your whole life?

You see how well it spends
when you're in hell.

Wait, no. I have a family.
[hostages scream, gasp]

Let's go.
[hostage crying]

<i>into his call to arms,</i>

and see it as nothing
but a smoke screen
to hide his criminal activity.

<i>He is recruiting ex-convicts.</i>

<i>He is attempting</i>
<i>to brainwash them...</i>
Merry Christmas.

<i>...so they can join his cause.</i>
[grenade clatters on floor]

If there is anyone found
aiding Ricky Conlan,

<i>you will feel the full force</i>
<i>of this city</i>

<i>brought to bear upon your heads.</i>

<i>Now, if you have any questions,</i>

<i>ask Captain Anna Shea</i>

<i>and see what answers</i>
<i>she gives you. Thank you.</i>

-Motherfucker!
-[grunts]

You wanna sell us out?

Sell out a great man
like Conlan?

I heard you call
your ball and chain,
motherfucker.

The fuck is wrong with you?

Oh, it's a long list, brother.

He could have done for you
what he did for me.

He took me from the streets
and gave me purpose,

made me real.

Disappointment is
a hell of a thing.

Do unto others...

...as you would have them
do unto you.

[Conlan chuckles]

You wanted them
to shoot me down like a dog.

No.

Why did you try
to cut a deal?

Come on,
you were gonna burn my ass

to save yours, weren't you?

No, no, no. That's not what--

-Don't you lie to me.
-Okay.

Yeah, okay. I may be a liar,
but I'm not fucking crazy.

[Rhodes groaning]

Well, in a society like this,

being crazy could be
a beautiful thing.

You know?

So let me ask you one more time.

Did you try to cut a deal

with the New York
pig department?
[groans, pants] F--

is the truth.

All I want,
just the truth, son.

Just fucking kill me, man.
Let's get it over with.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

You don't under--
This is not your fault.

No, no. Th--

This is part of
the great deception
of the liars.

They used you
just like they used me.

Don't you see?

They distracted us
with all the-- the splendor,

and the gold, and the--
and the-- and the--

and the pageantry
and the theatrics. Right?

"You're doing
such a good job, son.

<i>Well done</i>
<i>servicing your country."</i>

[people clamor]
<i>xenophobia.</i>

This jingoism
they filled in our heads,
and they walked us out there.

And they gave you--

They gave you a pigskin.

And they said, "You carry it
from one end of the battlefield
to the other."

And they handed me a rifle,
and they taught me how to kill.

He knows things, man.
He's a truth teller.

Hey, fuck you.

don't be angry at him.

Come on. You're angry at the
system that left you deserted

on the shores of poverty
and dissolution

without a cause to believe in.

But I've got that fixed.

'Cause you and I are the same.

We're both from
the same society.

We didn't do anything
wrong here. We're not criminals.

We're protagonists
in our own story.


I get it, that makes sense.
That makes sense, sure.

I want the truth.

I want the truth.


Your faith isn't strong enough
to get you to the next chapter,

my son.

to make you make a choice.

I really hate doing this,

but I have to
show you something.

It's good. It's kind of bad.

But one day, I promise,
you're gonna thank me for it.

No. No, no, no! Fuck you!


No, no, I tried--
I tried to fuck you, okay?

I'm a piece of shit, okay?

I'm-- I'm a drug addict.

Just let them go.

Fuck you! Let them go!

Fuck you! Let them go!

Shh.

There you go.

There you go. Look at me.

Look at me. Look at me.

Okay, okay, okay.

[Conlan laughs]

That's the spirit.

But you shoot me, they all die.

Okay? You shoot yourself,
they all die.

Okay, you have to
make a choice now.

You have to make a choice
so you can be free.

What's the choice?

Bring him in.
What?

and set yourself free.

Ah, fuck.

Oh, it's your brother.

This is me.

that gives you your freedom.

or your brother?

Okay, we already know
what you're gonna choose.

Right? Look what he's done
to you.

He brought you to the bookie
that you had to kill.

He-- He got you to--
to rob banks.

He taught you how to shoot
a gun. That's the guy.

Hurry it up. We got
a world to save.

Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

Him or your family.

One has to die.

Come on, Casey. You've already
made your fucking decision.

Come on.

Just do it.

I'm sorry, man.

Fuck, I'm sorry, brother.
No, no.

-I'm so sorry.
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

[gun clicks]


Fuck.

I'm sorry, but I had to see.


You sick fuck.

You actually pulled the trigger?


You are a true believer.

I knew you had it in you.

I am so goddamn proud of you.

Oh, Casey.

My man.

What's wrong with you
fucking people?

Look, I woke up this morning

and I thought, my God,
I have everything

I need in my life
except one thing.


Your fucking sanity?

You.

-[gunshot]
-Oh, fuck.

When was the last time
you slept?

I caught an hour
in the break room.

We get any word from Knight?

He's probably halfway
to Argentina by now.

Nah, he wouldn't run
from a fight.

Nah, you wanna think
the worst of him,

but he'll be there
when the time comes.
No.

You know, just because you
don't want something to happen

doesn't mean it won't.

I'm a single mother, Fitz.

I'm well aware of making plans
and having God interfere.

Seeing as how
you're already pissed off

and messing around
in my city without authority...

What?

Casey Rhodes.

What about him?

He busted out with Conlan
during the jailbreak.

Called his wife.
She cut a deal with us.

You cut a deal with the man who
put me in this fucking chair?

I want my city to be safe.

It's a means to an end.

You find anything on Conlan?

like he's about to pull off

the biggest heist in history.

Look, I've been doing some
research on potential targets.

Okay? And right now, the record
is the Cali truck job in '97.

The take was over 30 mil.

Mm-mmm.

Biggest heist was in '75.

Eight guys hit a secret bank
owned by the mob.

A secret bank?

Conlan may be crazy,
but he knows better than
to mess with the families.

Look, get some rest.

Knight will be back
at some point.

Yeah.

Speak of the devil.

They wanna put me on desk duty.
Can you believe that?

Probably for the best.
Excuse me?

Why, do you think if a guy
runs up a flight of stairs,

I can't catch him?

full of Christmas spirit,

aren't you, huh?

You old bastard.

See, the games have changed,
my brother.

There's no more rules.
There's no more codes.

The game has changed.

Yeah, Conlan isn't human.

Look, the captain spoke
to the mayor.

I spoke to the mayor.

He-- He had this itinerary
on his desk.

Some kind of meeting set up at,
I don't know,

Wooddrake Antiques
or something.

Can you believe that shit?

That guy is out shopping
while his city is under siege

from a madman.

You wanna hear
something else crazy?

Rhodes is cutting a deal
with the captain.

And the DA is gonna go for it.

Desperate times.

Christ, if I get
my fucking hands on Rhodes,

I'm gonna put my gun up his
ass, pull the trigger.

Jesus Christ.

You can't stop thinking
about him, can you?

Just forget about this
and come back to LA.

They have zero physical evidence
to lock you up.

Your daughter misses you.

Christ, I miss you.

Do you know how much shit
Macey is giving me
for even being here?

I'll be lucky if I'm not
divorced before New Year's.

I am who I am.

Okay, fine. You know what?
Don't listen to me.

But Conlan isn't like
any other criminal.

Don't let Conlan get
to you like Winna.

You'll never come back.

Well, you're wrong.

No, I'm your friend.

You've saved my life more times
than I've had hot meals,

and I feel like it's time
for me to repay the debt.

Well, if Conlan kills me,
then so be it.

Knight, I...

And you know what?

Fuck you for making me
all sentimental.

Just come home.

Don't-- Don't turn
into a monster

by chasing a monster.

Okay? That's all I ask.

Just say grace
and I'll be there soon.

Don't be so dramatic.

The kids aren't gonna care
that I missed dinner

when they see the presents
I got them.

[voices chanting] <i>Ho.</i>
Okay.

Jerome, drive.

Oh, shit.

Conlan said I would be spared.

-He looked me right in the eye--
-Really?

'Cause he told me
to eat the rich.

Wondering if he was
meaning that literally.

I told Conlan where every bank
in this city

was consolidating its valuables.

We made a deal.
Mmm.

Well, he sent me to renegotiate.

Have you seen my son?
Where's my son?

Have you seen...

[engine starts]

[store bell dings]

Boy, get your ass over here.

Gonna miss my TED Talk.

Now, I know Conlan is
a mad son of a bitch.

But all the great ones are.

That man has
shown me the truth.

Every one of us has been
abused, used by the system.

They have taken our time,
our life.

They have put us in cages
for crimes that the 1%

commit every day.

This city belongs to us.

It is ours.
And it always has been ours!

And now it's time to make
everybody see the light.


Thanks to our new brother here,
the mayor will let us in.

And we'll take it from there.

No prisoners, no survivors.

Some of you won't make it out.

But upon your fallen bodies,

we will build the foundation
of this great movement.

One day, many years from now
when you're old,

lying in your deathbed,

you'll look up
at your loved ones

and one moment

will flash before your memory.

This day.

This moment of greatness.

You're my brothers,
and I'm proud of you.

Hey.

You came to me, remember?

You said your father
held you down.

He put his foot on you

and pushed you to the ground,

so he could rise up.

And now what?

Now you're alone?
No, you're one of us.

You're part of our family.
You're in a real family now.

I'm proud of you.

You made the right choice.

'Cause we will always
be there for you.

Treat him the way you
treat each other.

He's one of us now.

You got this.

You're with us now.

And you will do exactly
as we say.

You speak when I tell you.

You jump when I tell you.

You shoot when I tell you.

Now get dressed, bitch.

I hear you've been chasing me.


<i>Why haven't you caught me yet?</i>
<i>You growing old?</i>

<i>Slowing down?</i>

Yeah. Traffic.

<i>Traffic, oh!</i>

Liar.

God, how I hate liars.

This city is full of liars,
hypocrites and thieves.

<i>Rhodes?</i>

Oh, yeah.

He sees the big picture.

The great liberation.

<i>He's a part of it now.</i>

I'm like the North Star,

guiding the way through
this cold Christmas night.

And he's riding alongside
of me like Pegasus.

And all he wants--

All he wants is to be
with his family.

He's becoming one of us.

<i>He's like Saul</i>
<i>when he became Paul.</i>

Evolving into something
bigger and better.


I never said he was smart.

[Conlan laughs]

<i>I miss you, James.</i>

I do. I miss us.

Oh, we would have been
great together.

It's too bad.

There are no more cowboy cops,

and they've killed
all our heroes.

It's just us.

[Conlan sighs]

<i>You think I'm just robbing banks</i>
<i>and blowing up banks?</i>

So much more than that.

You don't see the big picture.

Christmas is about togetherness.

It's not all this material shit.
Who cares?

Toys and gadgets,
they don't mean anything.

Hope.

Hope is all that matters.

And hope is a dangerous thing.

<i>One last time, James.</i>

<i>Join me.</i>

Got any booze?

<i>Yeah.</i> [laughs]

<i>The mayor just told me where</i>
<i>he's keeping the good stuff.</i>

After tonight, I'm gonna stay
drunk until Valentine's Day.

It's gonna be like Fort Knox
for alcoholics over here.

[Conlan laughs, sighs]

Join me.

Last chance before
I change the world.

This only ends
when one of us is dead.

If you insist.

Let's move!

Brother Knight,
change takes sacrifice.


<i>where he's keeping</i>
<i>the good stuff.</i>

Some kind of meeting set up at,
I don't know,

<i>Wooddrake Antiques</i>
<i>or something.</i>

[phone line ringing]


Thank you for being here
on Christmas Day.

[cell phone vibrating]

Well, it's nice to know
you remembered my number.

<i>where he's gonna hit.</i>

Wooddrake Antiques.

It's a front for the 1%.

<i>He wasn't robbing banks.</i>

<i>He was creating fear.</i>

<i>He made everyone put their</i>
<i>valuables in one place.</i>

There's no reason
to rob a hundred banks

when you can just, you know,
rob one.

Well, that's some damn
fine work, Detective.

<i>Don't move. Let me tell Shea.</i>

<i>You can't catch Conlan alone.</i>
<i>He's got nothing to lose.</i>

<i>If I can save just one person,</i>
<i>it's worth it.</i>

That's what I do.

Hey, Knight, don't go
in there alone.

Kni-- Knight!

Shit.



He has my son.

They brainwashed my son.

He came willingly.

your promise, Conlan.


Listen to the politician

give us lectures
on broken promises.


The only promise I made was
to the Almighty himself.

I promised him to keep
heaven full of fresh souls.

So Rhodes here better be
enthusiastic in his support,

or his beautiful wife, Lily,
and that sweet daughter, Clara,

are never gonna wake up
to open their presents on--

Please, Conlan.

We had a deal.

I can give you
anything you want.

I can give you
the keys to the city.

The keys to the city?

Really? You can give me
the keys to the city?

I don't need
the keys to the city

when I have the keeper of
the keys right here in my van.

Not like this.

This is too far.

You're gonna set
the city back 50 years.

No, no, no, my brother.

I'm going to propel
the city into the future.

We're gonna expose
the dark secrets of the elite.

So lock and load, brothers.

We got a job to do.

Smile, Mayor.

It's Christmas.


Let the games begin.

Gonna deck the halls
with blood, motherfuckers.

Let's go.

The other guys are in position.

I need to make a withdrawal.

[button beeps]

[door buzzes]

How's it going?

Hi.

[button buzzes]

You can come in now.


Let them have everything!

Just give them what they want!

We don't have
to be given anything.

We're gonna take everything.

Let's get this party started.

[bank robbers chanting]
<i>Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.</i>

<i>Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.</i>

<i>Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.</i>

<i>Ho. Ho. Ho.</i>

Jingle on this, bitches.

[chanting continues]

[chanting stops]

Please, don't shoot.
I'm just the lookout.

[Arthur sobbing]

It was never supposed
to be like this.

Conlan said we were
starting a revolution.

How many in there?

Ten, 15.

I don't know.

But they're all cons.

Hard-core.

I just wanted to be tough.

I bet you're tough now.

Fuck off.

[bank robbers chanting]
<i>Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.</i>

Don't move.

[chanting continues]

Move it.

Stay frosty, Santas.

Open the vault.

Move!

[chanting continues]

Oh. Merry Christmas,
my brothers.

Time to reap the rewards
of your loyalty.

All this just
to steal some shit?


This is about
rebooting the system.

Oh, bullshit.

Bullshit, man.
You're nothing but a thief.

No.

I'm no thief.

I'm just a man who played
the system that made me.

Shit.

Part of you believes
in this mission.

I can see it in your eyes
right there.

Look at this.

Look at these riches.

We can overthrow
governments with this.

We can bring about
the great liberation.

This is the beginning
of the unbreaking of humanity.

My father taught me
to fix what's broken.

Your father was a cuck.

With the deep state's balls...

[clicking tongue]

...tickling his tonsils.


My father taught me that
if you can't change the world,

bring it to its knees.

We are so close.

So close.

Don't you understand?

They killed my son
with their fake wars.

I will end them before
they do that to your child.

I'm doing this for you.

Help me, I beg you.

Listen to me. Listen to me.

Listen to me.

Christmas is about togetherness.

I need you.

I need you to help these men
bring out that loot.

Do that, and I swear
on the baby in the manger,

I will let your family go.

We're out of here
in four minutes, Santas.

You did good.

[sirens wailing in distance]

Stupid-ass elites think
they can hide their pearls

in a closed-down bank.

Yeah, this shit got to be
at least nine figures
once it's fenced.

Money is just a way
of keeping score.

We'll redistribute the wealth
of the world.

We did it, Dajon. [laughs]

Okay, I'm done.

You're done
when I say you're done.
No, no, no, no.

I helped you get your little
fucking war chest thing, okay--

This is not a negotiation.
I'm fucking done.

Get your fucking hands
off me.

I have your wife.

I have your daughter.

You're one of us now.

Act like it.

Hey! Who are you?

What the-- Oh, fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

What the fuck is that?
Is that a grenade?

Fuck, fuck, fuck! Where
did it go? Where did it go?


Hurry the fuck up. He's here.

Come on, go! Come on, go!

[gunfire in distance]

The fuck is all that?

[gunfire continues]

Fuck is all that?

You tip 'em off?

He's here.

Where are you hiding, Detective?

I can smell you.

Fear everywhere, buddy.

You handsome bald devil,
come out and play.



Nothing better to do
on Christmas Eve?

This is as good
as it gets for me.

Well, with friends like us,
who needs family?

[Rhodes groans]

Am I right?

This is how it's gonna go.

I'll tell you how.

I'm gonna shove a Christmas tree
up your ass...

...and set it on fire.

A Christmas tree up my ass?

All the way.

Okay, okay.

You're even kinkier
than I thought, Detective.

But I like that.

No foreplay, okay?

You're gonna make sure
we walk out of here
free and clear.

a gun to his head?

The fuck do I care?

Shoot him.

What?

You shot my partner.

See what I'm dealing with here?

He sold you up the river,
Rhodes.

You mean nothing to him.

Less than nothing.

Less than nothing. Wow.

You're cold, Detective.

Wow.

Dajon, you forgot to
get me a Christmas present.

I would like this motherfucker's
head in my stocking, please.

just kill him?

Where is your Christmas spirit,
Detective Knight?


Dajon, quit fucking around.

You let that pretty boy
kick your ass?

I trained you better than that,
you little pussy.

[both grunting]


[grunting, groaning]

-[gun clicks]
-[Knight] Fuck.


[grunting, groaning]

Sounds like Santa Claus didn't
give you enough ammunition

for this party.

Don't you worry.

Father Conlan has
more than enough bullets

to share with you.


You were right again, Knight.

This only ends
with one of us dead.

Merry Christmas, motherfucker.




How you doing, brother?

[grunting, groaning]

You f-- Oh.


Didn't see that coming.


Are we good?

I mean, not, you know,
good good.

But good enough?

I'm gonna give you five seconds
before I lube up my gun.

What the fuck does that mean?

Well, I guess you're gonna
find out in four.

One.

Two.

Three.


[sirens wailing]

Mom!

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

be okay. It's okay.

Thank you.

Thank you, thank you.


Arthur, where are you?

[police officer] Freeze! NYPD!

Put it down! Hands
where we can see them.

I'm looking for my son.

Arthur Vassetti.

Please, help me find my son.

Where is my son?

My son's name
is Arthur Vassetti.

Ricky Conlan took my son!

your son at church?
Where's my son, Arthur?

you working for Conlan?

[crowd chanting] Lock him up!
Lock him up!

Ricky Conlan has my son.

Find my son!

[no audible dialogue]

You're the gift that keeps
on giving.

You win.


Don't let them put me in a cage.

I'm not going back.

Kill me.


Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

[voices chant] <i>Ho!</i>

[court official]
The State calls to the stand
Detective Fitzgerald.

on your feet again, Fitz.

Anything to make you happy,
Mason.

How about you save us all
a bunch of time

and tell us the real truth
about your partner?

Oh, where do I begin?

Knight was cleared
for the extraordinary events

in New York City
and the prosecutor lacks

the evidence he needs
to charge him for the murder

of one Jerry Leach
which, ipso facto,

does not make that guy innocent.


Who gives a fuck?

No one's crying for Jerry Leach.

The man was a convicted murderer
who got off on a technicality.

If Knight killed him,

it was only to stop him
before he hurt someone else.

Detective,
is the world a safer place

with Knight behind bars
or behind a badge?

Honestly, where do I begin?

He's moody, disorganized,
he drives fast,

talks shit all day.

He's a workaholic.

I once caught him teaching
my eldest son

to do e-brake turns
in a parking lot.

Okay, my son Sam is nine.
Nine years old.

And he didn't think that
he was doing anything wrong.

He has yet to pick up a check,
not once in the eight years

that we've been partners.

Let's just say
this guy is an asshole.

But it's not his job
to be liked.

This man has more experience
than the rest of the guys

in the department combined.

He's the first man on the
scene. He's the first man
through the door.

This guy is a cop.

And we are all much safer

with James Knight
behind the badge.

[department representative]
<i>After hearing</i>
<i>two dozen testimonies</i>

<i>assessing victim</i>
<i>impact statements</i>

<i>and his past cases,</i>
<i>the department recommends that</i>

<i>James Knight be reinstated</i>
<i>effective immediately.</i>

<i>Congratulations, Detective.</i>
