The silence of God

drove me crazy.

Until one day he spoke to me.

And God said, "I've seen Mort...

And if I were you

I'd definitely cheat on him."

I am lost and confused.

I believe that God
punishes us for our sins...

But Sue and myself have no sins.

And Mort's only sin is -

that he likes movies with subtitles.
