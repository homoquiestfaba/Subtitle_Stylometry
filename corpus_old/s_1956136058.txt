to interview a patient

has not uttered a word.

Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

I'm Dr. Ranbir Sartain.

Great to finally meet you.
<font color="#FFA500">(DOOR CLOSES)</font>

Thank you so much for taking
the time to meet with us today.

We were hoping to have
this opportunity

before he's transferred
to the new facility.

Glass Hill
is far less accommodating.

Glass Hill is the pit of hell.

For years, he's been kept here
to be studied.

I suppose the state
has lost interest

in discovering
anything further.

Well, that's why we're here.

<font color="#00FF00">SARTAIN:</font> Michael has been
my life's obsession.

I've examined every single
case file written on him.

I was a student of Dr. Loomis
before he passed away.

And then I lobbied
the University of Illinois

to be assigned
to Michael myself.

Any progress?

Well, he's been seen by
over 50 clinical psychiatrists,

and with each,
many different opinions.

Dr. Loomis was the only one
to see him in the wild.

And he concluded he was
nothing more than pure evil.

Our patients get fresh air,
sunshine,

a view, proper exercise,
healthy diet.

It pains me
to see him transferred

to that less-than-desirable
facility.

And there he is.

He can speak.

He just chooses not to.

I'd love to stand
closer to him, if I may.

Get a sense of his awareness,
or lack of awareness.

Oh, make no mistake,
he's aware.

He was watching you
as you arrived.

Perhaps you'd like to tie
your left shoelace?

Mr. Tovoli here, the gentleman
with the umbrella,

has a fixation for such things.

Underestimate no one.

Of course.

And now step up
to the yellow line.

And no further.

Do not cross the line
under any circumstances.

Michael.

Michael.

I've got some people
who'd like to meet you.

Hello, Michael.

My name is Aaron Korey.

I've been following your case
for years

and still know
very little about you.

I'd like to know more.

About that night.

About those involved.

Do you ever think about them,
Michael?

Feel guilt about their fate?

I borrowed something
from a friend

at the attorney general's
office, Michael.

So...

Aaron and I have made several

award-winning
public radio exposÃ©s.

Our last project shed new light

on a murder case
from 20 years ago.

We like to reexamine incidents
with an unbiased lens.

I believe there's
a lot to learn

from the horrors
you experienced.

There's nothing to learn.

There are no new insights

or discoveries.

So, is he real?

Who?

The Boogeyman.

I read you quoted...

You don't believe
in the Boogeyman?

I believe in Michael Myers,
deranged serial killer, but...

the Boogeyman, no.

Well, you should.

Okay.

Michael Myers is a human being

who killed his sister
when he was six years old.

Then he came after you.

We just want to know why.

We want a glimpse
inside his mind.

That's why your story
is so important.

My story?

<font color="#00FF00">AARON:</font> Two failed marriages.

Rocky relationship with your
daughter and granddaughter.

Michael Myers
murdered five people.

And he's a human being
we need to understand?

I'm twice divorced.

And I'm a basket case.

They're transferring him.

Tomorrow, 7:00.

He'll-he'll be locked away
until the end of his days.

That's the idea.

Let's talk about
when the state came

to take your daughter away.

She was 12 years old.

They said you were
an unfit mother.

How long until
you regained custody?

I didn't.

But you already knew that.

Laurie, we saw him.

We met with Michael.

I showed him the mask.

There was nothing.

No response. Nothing.

He won't talk to anyone.

Never has, but...

I think he might speak
with you.

So, why don't you sit down
with him

and say all the things
you must be longing to say.

Come with us,

and let us help you
free yourself.

Please.

<font color="#00FF00">LAURIE:</font> Time's up.

I'll accept my payment.

Get out.

You want to shit under my sink?

I will murder you
and your whole family.

so I can make it tonight.

You really didn't
have to do that, Mom.

It's not a big deal.

<font color="#00FF00">RAY:</font> You made it into
the National Honor Society.

<font color="#00FF00">KAREN:</font> Yeah.

Cameron is a good guy.
He's nothing like that.

You're gonna see
when you meet him tonight.

They're all nice guys
until they get you pregnant,

and then you gotta drive
in their pickup trucks,

and you clean their guns,
and you got children,

and you clean guns, and you
like to get high with them,

and then y'all get fat.

Hey, Dad?

What?
Can you stop?

I gotta clean
this peanut butter off my hand.

Did you invite Grandmother

About tonight.
You said that you'd...

Oh.

Right. I did.

You did?
Yeah.

I talked to her yesterday.

She's not gonna be able
to come, honey. I'm sorry.

my grandmother tonight,
but she didn't.

I mean, she never even
contacted her.

How do you know?
Because I called her myself.

That's bullshit.
Yeah.

Dude, what's your mom's deal?
Why would she say that?

I don't know. She just tries
to keep me away from her.

Everyone in my family, like,

turns into a total nutcase
this time of year.

If I were you guys,
I wouldn't celebrate, either.

I would just put up
a Christmas tree instead.

Just skip all over the
creepy Halloween shit, right?

Does your grandma
ever talk about it?

Yeah, it's pretty much
all she talks about.

It defines her life.

She's been traumatized
ever since.

Wasn't it her brother
who, like,

cold-blooded murdilated
all those teenagers?

No.

That's just a bit
that some people made up

to make them feel better,
I think.

I mean, that is scary to have
a bunch of your friends

get butchered
by some random crazy person.

Is it, though?
Because, all things considered,

there's a lot worse stuff
that's happening today.

And, like, I mean, what,
a couple people getting killed

by one guy with a knife
is not that big of a deal.

Dude, her grandmother
was almost fucking murdered.

And she escaped,
and they caught him,

and now he's incarcerated.

I-I'm just saying, like,
by today's standards...

Just shut the fuck up, Dave.

Doctor, would you say
that Laurie Strode

There are many ways
for tragedy and violence

to change a victim.

They can grow accustomed
to always being afraid,

in constant fear.

They can grow weak,
they can grow strong.

But there's also
the other side.

What other side is that?

The effect on the victimizer.

You see, this is
what has intrigued me

through my studies.

How does a crime
like Michael's affect him?

Is he on a random path,

imprinted on his very being.

I want to know what pleasure
he gets out of killing.

We gotta find him.

These people want
to kill this man

for the crimes you observed.

The most important opportunity

to understand the mind
of evil, you see.

So, when he awakes,
we'll be ready.

Ready for what?

The reunion.

Michael's pursuit
of Laurie Strode

could be what keeps him alive.

I would suspect
the notion of being a predator

or the fear of becoming prey
keeps both of them alive.

You're so predictable.

<font color="#00FF00">FRANCIS:</font> Oh, here we go.

No, a banh mi sandwich.

Banh mi is essentially just

the Vietnamese version
of a French baguette.

Mm-hmm.
And the term actually refers

to the bread and not so much
the contents therein.

Mm.
But your partner,

the greatest partner in the world...
Oh.

...made an arrangement
with the Vietnamese folks

at the restaurant...
Mm.

...and had them make you
your very own

peanut butter and jelly
banh mi sandwich.

That sounds disgusting.

I'm not gonna try that.
I brought my own food.

I'm very happy with my...
What did you bring?

You want to see what I brought?

Yeah, I do want to see
what you brought.

Why don't you look at this?

Look at that.
Oh.

Fresh brownie.
Okay.

Chocolaty homemade brownie.
I made that myself.

That's-that's, like,
what a five-year-old would eat

their own lunch.

<font color="#00FF00">SARTAIN:</font> I worked

I've never heard him speak,

In spite of my encouragements,
he remains unresponsive.

But tonight,
so many possibilities exist.

He spoke to me.

He spoke to you?
Yeah.

Um, uh,
when he murdered my friend,

he saw me,
and-and he spoke to me.

What did he say?

One word.
What?

Let me go, and I will tell you
what he said.

You must tell me.
I must know. You must tell me.
