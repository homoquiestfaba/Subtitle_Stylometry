[Walt exhales]
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

Hi, I'm Walt and this is
my official application

for the Kovi Industries
Student Mars Program.

Not that the last 36
applications weren't official,

it's just this is
my final one.

because they are actually
making me graduate
after this semester,

so... Okay.

<i>I was raised by a single mom.</i>
<i>She had, like, 100 careers.</i>

<i>We moved around like crazy,</i>
<i>so I never really had</i>
<i>a home base.</i>

<i>But one time</i>
<i>when I was, like, six,</i>

<i>she took me to see</i>
<i>this solar eclipse</i>

and from that moment on
all I wanted to do
was go to the Sun.

And I know that you can't
actually go to the Sun.

My mom would try to tell me
that, but I would
just stare at it.

Uh, and I was obsessed.

<i>Because there was more</i>
<i>out there than the new town,</i>

<i>or the new school which always</i>
<i>felt like the same town</i>
<i>and the same school</i>

and I think if I could've
gotten the chance to just

go up there and look back
I would've seen...

where I fit in,
in this crazy universe.

<i>Exploration is the way</i>
<i>that we discover where</i>
<i>we truly belong</i>

and I just...
I don't belong here.

Which is all to say
that I think I would be
a perfect fit

for the Geological Survey Team,
or Propulsions Analysis
Department.

Botany and Terraformation Crew,
Security Detail, Rover Repair.

Look, if you need someone
to make you coffees,
I'm your guy.

I am your guy.

That's it.

Um... Okay.

Well, with any luck,

the next time you see me

uh, I will be on Mars.

<i>This planet isn't</i>
<i>cutting it anymore.</i>

<i>I'm self-made billionaire,</i>
<i>Leon Kovi</i>

<i>and I cannot wait</i>
<i>to meet you on Mars.</i>

Light foam.

Oat milk latte. Light foam.

is borderline unhealthy

and you are on the wrong side
of that border.

Exactly.

Should I fire you,
so you can go there?

Let's do it, Walt.
I'll fire you.
It truly would be my pleasure.

No, Gary. I love it here.


-[woman] Oat milk latte?
-Light... foam?

-Gary?
-[Gary] Yes, Walt?

Did she just smile at me?

she smiled past you.

-Analysis.
-There is a 52% chance

of romantic interest.

But a 48% chance she pities you
due to your low status position

as an assistant barista

to a robot
on a university campus.

Shall I continue?

I honestly feel like I'm gonna
get accepted this time.

You're projecting.

So what?

Leon Kovi was 25 when he became
the very first man
to set foot on Mars.

And here we are, just settling

for the same classes and jobs
and parties that our parents
went to,

and their parents went to
before them and their parents
went to before them--

So you're not coming to
the party?

-Of course,
I'm coming to the party.
-Great. Come on.

-You're carrying the booze.
-[Walt] No, come on.

-We're gonna forget about it
and I'm gonna take it to work.
-Walt,

I'm gonna need you to
keep the whole

Walt-ing thing
in check tonight.

-"Walt-ing"?
-Bummer monologues.

-Leon Kovi hero worship.
-It's not hero worship.

-That came with
the application packet.
-Not the frame.

Don't you wanna be
part of something special?

Walt.

You're not special.

I'm not special.

Most people, not special.

Listen, someday,
you're gonna meet someone

and make something special
with them.

Like a memory.

Or a weird, well, baby thing.

But until then,

drink this and for the love
of God do not bring up Mars.

-[club music playing]
-This place is nuts.

Do you live here?

Oh, no. Some trust fund girl.


You know, when I was little,
I had this fantasy
that my mom--

Ooh, let's not.

Yeah.

Bathroom?

It's beautiful.


Okay, show me yours.


<i>Hi, human Sophie.</i>

<i>Nine months.</i>

<i>Nine months until</i>
<i>my parents' contract is up</i>

<i>and we return to Earth.</i>

<i>Nine more months</i>
<i>without touching you.</i>

<i>At least this way, you will</i>
<i>know when I want to touch you</i>

<i>and vice versa.</i>

Well, I hope touching me
is a lot more fun than touching
one of these.

<i>No, no, no, it is.</i>
<i>The texture's for, like...</i>

<i>Can you guys please stop</i>
<i>talking about touching</i>
<i>each other in here?</i>

-Hi, Brandon.
-[Brandon]<i> Hi, Sophie.</i>

<i>Jan, can you get Brandon</i>
<i>out of here?</i>

-[Brandon]<i> Will you stop</i>
<i>calling her Jan? It's "Mom."</i>
<i>-Jan, get your idiot son out!</i>

<i>my butt? Now the hole.</i>

<i>way too much, dawg!</i>
<i>Get out of here.</i>

-Is that on Mars?
-Oh! What are you doing?
Get out!

Just looking for the bathroom.

Who walks into bathrooms
without knocking?

Walt. Is this live?

How did they solve
for the time delay?

<i>It's called quantum splicing.</i>

Don't talk to him.
I don't know this man.

-Could we exchange emails
or something?
-[Sophie] No!

-Mine's just "Walt"
five times at...
-[gasps]

I'm sorry. I can replace it.

Unless it's expensive.

-Get out.
-Right now?


Sorry. Jules tricked me
into throwing a party.

-[Jan]<i> And yet</i>
<i>you're in your room.</i>
-Uh, nope.

It's not really a party.
It's more of a soiree.


<i>I'm late for work. Love you.</i>

-Love you.
-[Calvin]<i> Love you, Mom.</i>

<i>Go. Mingle. We'll be back soon.</i>

<i>And in the meantime, it might</i>
<i>be good for you to have</i>
<i>some new experiences.</i>

Nothing's more overrated
than new.

<i>There's a title</i>
<i>for your thesis.</i>

<i>Sophie,</i>

<i>go.</i>

<i>I'll make sure Calvin</i>
<i>calls you tomorrow.</i>

-Night, Jan.
<i>-Goodnight.</i>

You know, I've been at this
school for three years.

Always said that I'd explore
these woods.

Never have. Guess I thought
that I would just...

to this school
for five years.

-Oh, five years, okay.
-[burps]

And I always said I'd explore
these woods too.

But know what?
Somebody already did.

A long, long time ago.

It's over.

There's nothing left
to discover.

You're okay, man.

You're a good listener.

[Ginny laughs]

I'm sorry.

I've never seen light flirting
take such a dark turn.

Basically my superpower.

Just one brief conversation
with me will

really leave you
questioning everything.

Not the hero we need, but maybe
the one we deserve.

You know, in about 14 seconds
you're going to get
the sudden urge to jump.

Oh, no. You're safe.

I'm already in the midst
of an existential crisis.

Oh, well. In that case,

Walt, at your service.

-Ginny.
-Ginny?

Yeah, the, uh,

astrophysics major?

How did you know that?

I was in your Intro to
Fluid Dynamics class.

Freshmen year.

This is the part where
you at least pretend
to remember me.

-Oh, my God! Walt! Wow.
-Yeah, thank you. Thank you.

Changed your major?

Sixteen times.

Only for
personal reasons like...

I have no idea what physics is.

But enough about me.
Tell me about your crisis.
What's going on?

Well, I'm

supposed to move tomorrow.

Big move, actually in, uh,

seven hours and...

Let's just say
it's a big commitment

and I'm not
a big commitment kinda gal.

Are you saying we're in
one of those

classic "we-only-
have-tonight" scenarios?

Will spending it with you
make me wanna stay?

the thing about here,

is that it's mostly garbage.

As you can see, to your left
and to your right

there's literal garbage
overflowing from

these receptacles at all times.

-Yeah.
-And it might magically
seem to disappear

but it's really just added
to that big floating pile
of garbage

in the Pacific Ocean.

Currently the size of Texas
and visible from space.

How scenic.

Now, the one great thing

about this particular
garbage factory

is its connection to
the last best chance

any of us have
at a real adventure.

The Kovi Industries
Mars Program.

So that's how
they got you here.

Yeah. But tomorrow another ship
will leave for Mars without me.

You could always rob a bank
and buy a ticket.

-Yeah, I'd have to rob,
like, nine banks.
-Hmm.

I have considered
the old air ducts plan.

You know, hide in the air ducts
survive on stolen food.

Pee in bottles that you dump
into other people's toilets
while they sleep.

so impressed when I arrive
that they just let me stay.

[Ginny laughs]

Curious how you spin garbage
into this spot.

a garbage-free zone.

It's like Mars.

Did you know that they send
all of their trash

back to Earth
on the return flights?

Okay, I gotta know.

Why Mars?

I feel like if I had been born
like 600 years ago

I would've stolen a boat
and just set sail by now.

And I probably would've died.

Oh, definitely would've died.

But it would've been
an adventure.

You know?

And now there's Mars
and I keep applying,

but 36 rejections later

and I'm starting to get
the feeling that...

They don't need
extraordinary mediocrity?

Yeah. That's funny.

No, I get it.

"Mars has been our mirror

our foil.

A telltale reflection of what
has been deepest in our hearts.

We've seen in Mars the utopia,

a wilderness, a sanctuary.

With so few landmarks,
guideposts, or constraints

all is possible.

Mars has been a blank canvas

and tenderly

our human seeking
has rushed to fill it."

Did you come up with that?

No.

Oh.

Sarah Stewart Johnson.
Astronomer.

-Smart.
-Hmm.

I think

when you look at something
from this distance,

it's all possibility.

Then every step you take
toward that

strips it away until

it is what it is.

And what it always has been.

[device beeping]

I'll miss you.

-Walt, from Earth.
-Okay.

If you ever make it up there,
give me a call.

Up where?

Mars.

You convinced me.

Wait.

What?

â™ª<i> Something's got</i>
<i>A hold on me â™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Right before my eyes</i>
<i>But I just couldn't see it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Magic's going to</i>

<i>â™ª You told me before</i>
<i>But, baby, now I believe â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ooh such a feeling â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You got to hold on</i>

<i>-Would you like to apply</i>
<i>for next year's mission?</i>
-[Walt]<i> No.</i>

I need you to check
an existing application.

Applicant ID 781-2439.

<i>Thirty-seven</i>
<i>applications found.</i>

<i>Application one, rejected.</i>

<i>-Application two, rejected.</i>
-Stop, stop. Please stop.

Application 37
is pending review

and I need you to approve it.

I need to be
on that ship tomorrow.

To be with the girl
of my dreams

who has slowly stopped
responding to my texts.

My chance at a relationship
is imploding

like a dying star.

-Do you understand?
<i>-I do, Walt.</i>

<i>And I sincerely hope</i>
<i>you can ask her out</i>

<i>in 412 days,</i>

<i>-after next year's mission.</i>
-Okay.

Angie. Angie.

I hate to say these words.

I really do.

-I need to speak
with your supervisor.
<i>-Of course.</i>

<i>-One moment.</i>
-Yes, Angie!

[same voice]<i> I am Alan,</i>
<i>Angie's supervisor.</i>

-Yes, Alan! Go, Alan!
<i>-Reviewing now.</i>

<i>-Application rejected.</i>
-No!

-Alan!
<i>-Commercial tickets</i>
<i>are still available</i>

<i>for the discounted price</i>
<i>of $937,000.</i>

<i>Wow, wow, wow!</i>

Who could afford that?

-[Gary] Greetings, Walt.
-Sorry I'm late, Gary.

Do not worry.
I have already docked your pay.

The lonely human at table 7B
has not moved for five hours
and 11 minutes.

Shit. I know her.
I broke her orb.

a beverage or leave.

Oh, come on, Gary.

Oh, come on, Walt.

Hey! You probably
don't remember me.

You broke my orb.

Good memory.

Is that supposed to
make us even?

No. But if you don't
order anything,
you can't use the Wi-Fi

and sit here
like a black hole of sadness.

-Company policy. It is.
-Stupid policy.

And you're gonna
have to pay for that.

Because if I do,
Gary will just
ask you to leave.

Are you serious?

Rarely. But right now, yes.

Yay.

How's the Mars boyfriend?

He's great.

-Yeah, he got
his Martian dream job, so...
-Wow.

...one year of long distance
just became indefinite.

And then my Wi-Fi cut out.

Probably because of all
the calls with him
trying to make it work.

And now I'm sitting here,
suffering in public

and paying for drinks
that I didn't order.

So you tell Gary,

I hope he gets malware.

long-term companionship

and learns the pain
of a solitary life.

[blowing nose]

for that one.

Believe it or not,

I might be the only person here

who knows exactly
what you're going through.

Because you're causing it?

No. Because my girlfriend

left for Mars a month ago

and hasn't texted me back
in three days.

How long have you guys
been together?

Since ninth grade.
So, eight years.

Eight years?

-How did you manage that?
-We had a plan.

One year, long distance
and then

he comes back to Earth
and I graduate

and we use his terraforming
expertise and my focus

on eco reconstruction
to jump-start an algae-based
waste reduction technology.

-What?
-Plants that eat garbage, okay?

It's how we're gonna save
the world.

-You're smart. [laughs]
-I know.

And what about you guys?

Ginny?

We've been dating since
freshman year-ish.

It got serious recently.

What does this Mars genius have

that I don't?

-Everything. Yeah.
-Everything?

Could you actually be
more specific?

I'm trying to figure out why
they keep rejecting
my applications.

all the boxes.

Oh. You mean, literally.

Okay, let's see.

"Quiet. Strong jaw.

Mental fortitude. Six-pack.

Good family, cool mom."
I have a cool mom.

Yeah? You guys close?

No. I mean "cool," like when
she was going
through the divorce

I was able to just do whatever
I wanted from 12 on.

Anyhow. "Hates video games.

Pragmatic and high-earning
potential."

-It's interesting.
-What?

That's an impossible checklist.

-That's my cue.
-You know,
if you really love this guy

I do know a way that you can
get on that ship tomorrow.

Two words.

Air ducts.

-Or I could just buy a ticket.
-Yeah, for like
a million dollars.

Do you have a million dollars?

-My finances are personal.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

That means you have
at least two million dollars.

What are you doing here?

Buy a ticket!

-It's your last chance
for a year.
-I can't.

You have the money.

I have aerophobia.

Well, we're all afraid
of arrows.

Oh, my God!
I'm afraid of flying.

[door buzzes]

-And now I'm trapped.
-You're trapped? I'm trapped.

-[Sophie] Gary, door!
-I can't even
get through security

to see
a shuttle launch up-close.

-Unlock the door, Gary.
-I'm afraid I can't do that.
Perhaps it's malware.

You can transcend
time and space.

In the name of love.
The ultimate adventure.

I'm filing a complaint
to corporate right now.
Open the door.

to call corporate.

A simple misunderstanding.

Walk away. Just like
I knew you would.

-You don't know anything
about me.
-I know everything about you.

No!

The only people who know me
are 55 million miles away!

The only people who know me
are 55 million miles away.

The only people
that know me are...

Gary?

Oh, God, that's sad.

No, no. No. Please, please.

Don't call corporate on Gary.
He's just gonna take it
out on me.

Calvin is on Mars.

Jan, Brandon, Jim,
they're all there.

How many boyfriends
do you have?

It's really that simple.

Goodbye, Walt.

<i>I know I went radio silent</i>
<i>for a hot minute,</i>

-Breathe on my face.
-[Walt] Bye, Gary.

-I'll miss you.
-[Gary] Goodbye, Walt.

I have already forgotten you.

You can do this. You're okay.

[over speakers]<i> I'm billionaire</i>
<i>astronaut Leon Kovi</i>

<i>and it's my pleasure to welcome</i>
<i>you to the Kovi Industries</i>
<i>International Spaceport.</i>

<i>Together, we can build</i>
<i>a better world</i>

<i>on a different world.</i>

-Hey!
-Oh, my God.

What are you doing here?

And what are you wearing?

I just came to see the launch.
And I got all this duty-free.

Wore it right out of the store.

Duty-free doesn't mean free.
You just robbed a gift shop.

What? No.

Wait, really?

Look, I just came to apologize.
I was a dick.
Also, I need a favor.

You are the ingrown toenail
of humanity.

-Leave me alone.
-Just hear me out
for one minute.

All I need is for you to tell
security I'm your family

-so I can accompany you
to the gate.
-What?

No. God! I'm leaving this
planet largely because of you.

And I totally understand.
Again, so, so sorry.

-It's just...
-It's just, "Go away."

You had a plan, right?

So you know what it feels like
when that plan
gets taken from you.

How it just kills you?

I barely got in this school.
I took out 100 loans

and I worked a dozen crappy
jobs because this was my plan.

To go to Mars.

And now Ginny is there
and I have to be with her.

I have to adventure with her.
Just like you.

-Just like Kelvin.
-Calvin.

Just like Calvin.

But now Ginny is gone.

And all I have left is
one last chance to see
a rocket launch up close

which I have dreamt about
for as long as I can remember.

Sophie...

you can keep my dream alive,

if only for
a couple more hours.

Please. Please help me.

You are not allowed to talk.

colonial mission
the ship's hull was damaged.

Kovi had to survive
in the air ducts.

Now, he almost died,

but his lung capacity
is unparalleled.

My lung capacity is also
kind of unparalleled.

When I was a kid, I actually
went under in the wave pool.

I was down there for, like,
three minutes

before anyone could
even pull me back up.

They all thought I drowned,
but I really just passed out.

That's why I never go to
the bathroom in the wave pool.

Did you know that this whole
building is triple-reinforced
with concrete?

Space concrete. In case
the shuttle explodes
on the launchpad.

Which has only happened twice.

-[Walt] What's happening?
-[Sophie] Shut up.

It's something I have to do
when I'm nervous.

-I dance to relieve tension.
-No, no, no. I'm into it.

-Don't make fun of me.
-I'm not.

This is the first

I've seen you do.

Oh, I actually

Don't worry,
I paid for it this time.

-Wait, wait, wait.
-You used me.

No. A little. I can explain.

I'm gonna hide
in that air duct. You're never
gonna see me again.

Until you get caught. Or die.

I'm not gonna get caught.

-I already caught you.
-Exactly. What are the chances

-You're so strong.
-Shut up.

they will link you to me.

-Yeah, but you didn't know.

us back in escape pods.

No, I can't get back

and just rip his jumpsuit off?

-Yeah?
-[chuckles] This is Sophie,
my girlfriend.

Long-term girlfriend.

I don't believe it.

I'm gonna have to rename
this corridor Lovers' Lane.

Tabby! Celeste!

Come meet your new neighbors.

Hello. I'm Tabby.

-This is Celeste.
-Hi. I'm Celeste.

-Sophie.
-Calvin.

-I'm a scientist.
-Engineer.

-Double threat.
-Enough shoptalk.

Tabby and Celeste over here,
or can I call you
Taboo and Celery?

They've been engaged
for nine years.

We are actually not engaged.

Yet. It's just when we were
talking earlier

I was saying,
"We'll probably get engaged

once we get to Mars."

-Congratulations?
-You know, as captain,

I could marry all of you guys.

I mean, not like
a four-way thing.

-Two weddings.
-We should do this.

-No.
-Full disclosure. I just need
to have a party on this ship.

Honestly. I can pilot
a four-billion-dollar spaceship

through an asteroid belt,
but I can't get one of you guys
to let loose.

You know what
I'm talking about?

You don't.

Well, it was nice to meet you.

Yeah.

Okay.

All right, you guys.
Just need to see your ID
so I can check you in,

and I'll be out
of your love nest.

I don't seem to have
my ID on me. I don't wanna
hold you up.

I can run it by
the bridge later.

I knew it.

You're the looks,
she's the brains.

Yeah.

Listen, when you find it,
just scan it on the wall
and Cornelia will log you in.

'Kay? Awesome.

Ooh, happy early birthday.

How old is she gonna be?

Trick question.
You never say a woman's age.

-[chuckles]
-How old do I look?

-[both] Trick question.
-[laughs nervously]

A-hole.

-[Walt] It's your birthday?
-In two weeks.

-Listen, I gotta...
-We should throw a party!

I don't do birthdays.

Jehovah's Witness?

No. They're arbitrary,
and we don't need
any extra attention.

Well, extra attention
is kinda the point.

Oh, no, I see what you mean.

All onboard data flows through
the manifest, which is
controlled by the ship's log.

So if anyone knows
how to print you an ID,
it's them.

How do you know all this stuff?

Do you think I would let
the love of my life

take one of these ships
across the solar system

without knowing exactly
how it's made?

Don't say that
like it's normal.

Hello?

R-I-G... G?


Huh.

Says here you were already on
the Olarun Two.

Oh, there...

Earl, this is a clerical error.

You know how computers
just get buggy sometimes?

Why are you two standing
so far apart?

Most young couples are all over
each other, kissing...

at an alarming frequency.

Yeah.

That makes sense.

Right, sweetie?

[groans softly]

Ah!

Say, Earl... what's this?

Space wine.

Cool.

I usually drink alone.

I gave Carla a glass...

but she can't hold her liquor.

Carla?

Oh. Carla, the computer.

your liquor.


Uh...

Earl...

-[slow music playing]
-[sizzling]

-[electricity crackling]
-Oh!

All right.

Soft reboot, Earl.

How do you know
how to do all this?

My thesis is on eliminating
planned obsolescence

and universal
mechanical literacy

as key tools to promote
biospheric sustainability.

It'd be kind of ironic
if I didn't know how to fix it,
you know?

Yeah. Yeah,
I know, I know. I do know...

It's ironic.


I had the most terrible dream.



Hello, Calvin.

Hello, Calvin.

Your photo will show up
in all the system reports

so as long as no one does
a deep search,
you should be fine.

Calvin hates social media.

Okay. Amazing.
Wow. My heart is racing.
What are we doing next?

Next? We lay low.

What? No.
Oh, my heart.

-Gary?
-Cornelia.

Cornelia, is my heart normal?

are elevated.

You may be experiencing
cardiac arrest...

or sexual reproduction.

Oh, it's definitely not
sexual reproduction.

Okay. We need a routine.

Be seen enough
not to draw attention.

Oh, here we go.

A lecture series by a few
of the Mars specialists
on board.


-Bathing in zero G...
-Soft maybe.

Food tube cooking, spacewalk...

Spacewalk?

No. You need a partner for that

and there's no way I'm getting
off the ship until it lands.

Come on, Sophie.
We are in the clear.

Let's go have some fun.

We're not gonna get caught.

They're not gonna kick us off.

Check it. Cornelia?

Greetings, Calvin-Walt.

Nope. Just Calvin.

Cornelia, wasn't there
a stowaway on the Olarun Three?

A feline was discovered.

And isn't that cat
now the very first cat on Mars?

<i>-No.</i>
-See?

What?

trial for her crimes against
the company.

Ripley.

And that's why we stick
to the plan.

-What's this?
-Calvin's practice interviews.

If you're going to be him,
you have to get to know him.

You filmed them?

I will download
his thesis for you
and explain it to you,

and show you
some of the messages
he sent me.

The PG ones.

You mean the boring ones.

Cornelia,
please dim the lights.

This is gonna suck, isn't it?


[upbeat music playing]

We can do quizzes
at 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.

-Two a day?
-Yes!

What about...

personal intimacy time?

We share that room.

Exercise some self-control.


<i>-Sorry, do we have</i>
<i>a call scheduled?</i>
-No, no, we didn't.

I just thought that you might
be in the mood.

Got to shit.

Wrong room! Wrong room!

Whoa! Whoa! Hypocrite!
Hypocrite! Hypocrite!

<i>Sophie! Sophie?</i>

-You get 10 minutes a day.
-15.

-Twelve.
-Fine.

Humans. AI. A crucial
relationship that should
always remain professional.

Even I struggle to follow.

We would love it if you would
do a lecture on terraforming.

-No.
-Since you are the expert.

He had a traumatic accident
on stage last year

and he's recovering still.

Did you get an erection?

-What?
-Yes.

-Oh, my God.
-Wow.

-You have to keep
a low profile.
-I am.

People wanna hang out with me
even after the erection rumors.

It's weird, I know. It's never
happened to me before.

It's because
they wanna hang out
with Calvin.

Ginny doesn't care
if I work out.

She does.

No, she doesn't.

She does.

Hey. No.

Pick it up.

I'm just trying to get

<i>-82%.</i>
-Yeah!

-Who was that?
-[Gary]<i> I am Gary.</i>

That's Cornelia. I reprogrammed
her name and voice to Gary.
After Gary.

You can't do that.

I'm lonely.
And you don't let me
talk to anyone.

No. You can't change things
without telling me, okay?

There's a plan
and we stick to the plan.

If we don't, we go to jail,
or we get ejected into the sun.

You can't just unilaterally
change things

because you're insecure
about your relationship.

Oh, I'm sorry. Are you talking
to me or are you talking to
Calvin right now?

What's that supposed to mean?

I didn't change your plans.
Calvin did.

I didn't ditch you
to go to Mars
for a job, Calvin did.

-I didn't refuse
to send you nudes.
-[gasps]

Those texts were off-limits.

I saw them by accident.

Where are you going?

I saw Earl eating ice cream,
but they don't serve it
in the cafeteria,

which means he's got his own
little supply that I'm gonna
steal from

because I am stressed.
And when I'm stressed,
I need sugar.

No!

I work here!

Does that ever really work?

Most of the time, yeah.

We have to get out of here.

We are going to get caught.

You are the only person that
ever catches me.

Okay. Okay.

If you're gonna be here,
you gotta pull your weight.

I know you're not used to this
sort of sneaking around,
espionage thing.

I am. I'm the expert here,

so I'm gonna be looking
for the refrigeration unit.

The cooling kind.

Like that one?

Okay. Come on.

Guess this means
I'm kinda grounded
for the rest of the flight?

-Kinda.
-Copy that.

And can you please keep
your opinions about
my relationship to yourself?

You've no idea what
we've been through.



control activated.

Sorry.

Okay. Apology accepted.

You know,
you're almost always right.

Even in those last three
arguments with Calvin.

And I know I shouldn't
have read them...

but you were right.

It's honestly creepy
and kind of annoying
how right you are all the time.

Especially as someone
who is wrong almost
all the time. Never right.

Well, except right now.

Me saying that you're right--

Okay. I got it. Thanks.
Now, let's go.

And you're totally right
to lock me in here
for the rest of the trip.


But can we please start
my house arrest tomorrow?

Why?

This is made out of algae?

Smells like it.

This is pretty bad.

It's awful.

Calvin would love it.

Okay, that's...

probably true.

I don't know how he does it.

Does what?

Super focused,
algae genius thing.

Like it's all he thinks about.

It's not all he thinks about.

Okay, well...

the great thing
about being Walt,

is that he's not smart enough
to think about any one thing
for too long.

I miss Walt. Good guy.

Handsome.

So, what about you and Ginny?

What about us?

You're flying to Mars
for her. You must
have some sort of plan.

I don't know.

I steal the spaceship...

travel the stars...

adventure.

What?

You've been on a spaceship,
traveling through the stars
your entire life.

Earth.

In a billion years...

we will never build
or find anything quite like it.

It's our only spaceship.

What could we possibly
do out here that
we couldn't do there?

You ever worry the wrong person
is headed to the wrong planet?

Me and Calvin?

No.

We'll be back.

Once his contract
is up... [sighs]

First his turn, then my turn.

Right. The plan.

We're building a life together.

And when you find
something extraordinary,
you fight for it.

Sacrifice for it. Protect it.

Yes.

Because what most of us
fail to appreciate...

when presented with something
truly unique, is that it will
only ever exist once.

You read my thesis.

I may have even understood it.

That is weirdly touching.

That algae really
isn't sitting well.

Don't mention algae.


Unfortunately,
I've just learned
that our scheduled speaker,

Doctor Franklin Dearborn...

has come down with a mild case
of "space madness."

-Awesome.
-And his scheduled presentation

on the theoretical limits
of quantum propulsion
is being rescheduled.

However, I was
logging on to one of
the community terminals

and I came across
this fascinating
thesis presentation.

There it is.

Calvin Riggins...

-Oh, shit.
-Oh, my God.

...is our very modest but very
accomplished expert in
terraformation.

And I'm hoping
he'll save the day

by coming up here
and teaching us a bit

about how Mars will someday
be as green as Earth.

Hopefully, greener,
as Earth is dying.

Come on up here, Calvin.


-What do I do?
-I don't know. Maybe just riff.

Isn't, like, talking
your superpower?

Calvin!

One second.

Calvin! Calvin!


Give me one of your earbuds.
We'll use it like a
walkie-talkie.

You can just tell me
what to say.

I left them in the room.


Have them eject me
towards the sun.

here he comes!

He's coming up!

Don't worry.
If you get an erection,
keep going.

[mic feedback buzzes]

Uh, hi.

I'm Calvin.
I'm a terraformologist.

[audience chuckles softly]


Let's start with the basics.

Terraforming...

which comes from
the Latin term "Terra..."

-Oh, God.
-...meaning "Earth..."

and forming...

That's forming.

"Changing Mars for us."

Changing for us.

Changing...

Someone a lot smarter than me
once said that Mars
is like our mirror.

The reflection of
what is deepest in our hearts.

Calvin, that's so true.

After traveling with you guys
for the last few weeks,

I don't really know
if that's true anymore.

When I look at you,
I see the smartest people
on the planet.

And you've spent
your entire lives

trying to check an impossible
set of boxes...

for Mars.

And I get it.

Mars is awesome. I applied to
this program, like, 37 times.

[all chuckling]

But maybe
when you find that thing

that you're willing
to cross the entire universe
to be with...

just make sure it's ready
to do the same for you.

Don't terraform yourself.

It's your life, too.

<i>Thanks for listening!</i>

I'm done.

That was it? A little short.

Tabby...

let's get married.

What?

I mean engaged to get married.

Calvin's presentation,
it was useless from
a technical perspective...

but he's right.

I should have
never put Mars before us.

Before you.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

What say you, woman?

Yes!

Yes!

[all cheering]

Listen up, everybody.

Mandatory engagement party
in T-minus 30 minutes.

[upbeat music playing]

It's finally happening!

A real dance party!

It's time to shine, bitch.


Hey!

Hey.

Did you make this?

I didn't pack a dress.

You are so annoyingly
good at things.

Coming from a guy that just
inspired an engagement party

with a speech pulled from
the deepest recesses
of his own ass.

Oh, this isn't
an engagement party.

What are you talking about?

It's a birthday party.

I don't do birthdays.

You also
don't fly on rockets

or conspire with stowaways.

I think you just gotta face it.

You're a space criminal now.


Now make a wish. And don't wish
to go on a spacewalk with me

because that's, kind of,
an open-door policy.

Any time. Any time.

Please.

Spacewalk.


You got it.

Do you wanna get your parents
on a video call?

My parents died when I was 14.

What?

I'm so sorry.

I had no idea.

Calvin's family took me in.

Well, Jan, actually.

She didn't even hesitate.
It was just,
"Here's your room."

"What are your favorite meals?"

and "I'm ready to go shopping
whenever you are."

You know,
Calvin probably wouldn't
go to a party like this.

Okay. I'll go peacefully.

Just let me have one more song.

No, I mean...
you should be Walt tonight.

'Cause you miss him so much.

Come on, Tsukino.

Yeah!

-Oh, my God, it's our room.
-Here we go.

sound control activated.

I should really go
hang up this dress.

Yeah, let's keep it on.

Think of it like
a really big bib.

That space wine hits extra hard
with this altitude.

Oh, my God, Walt.

We are in space,
not high in the sky.

Do you have any idea
how space works?

I'm sorry.

Sometimes you're just so dumb
and it makes me so angry.

I know.

Makes me angry too.


Gary, can you please
dim the lights?

I feel like a Hot Pocket.

Hey.

What should we do for
my birthday?

Something
old Sophie couldn't...

but new Sophie can.

[dramatic music playing]



-We're gonna die.
-Eventually.

In glorious battle.

-Let's go back inside.
-No.

Look at me.

On three.

What? What on three?

You know what on three.

Seriously?

One.

One.

-Two.
-Two.

-Three.
-Three.

Listen up, everybody.
Roughly 11 minutes ago,

our hull was breached by an
unidentified piece of debris.

Our O2 reserves
have been pierced,

so we'll be docking
at the Mars orbital station,

and we'll take
a freight shuttle
to the surface.

Come with me.


They're checking IDs at
the Mars database, which is
basically space customs.

So the moment they scan yours,
they're gonna see that Calvin
is already on Mars.

Oh, shit.

Question.

Do you think you can fit
in my suitcase?

That feels like
a first draft idea.

Okay. Well, if you weren't so
gangly then it might work.

What if we say there
are two Calvins?

The one on Mars
is already the imposter.

I could sleep with
Captain Tarter.
I know that I'm her type.

It's like a honeypot scheme.

We know that she's indebted
to me after that point,

and not because I want to
or anything, but because it,

-you know, would help us--
-Okay, stop.

How do you feel
about air ducts?

Of course.

You picked the wrong shaft.

You idiot. You moron.

I'm here.

Why wouldn't you say so?

I thought you were gonna
do the whole

"She thought he was dead
and then she revealed

"that she actually thought
he was a great guy" thing.

You need to get upstairs with
everyone else.

I'm gonna be
totally fine down here.

It's pretty cramped up there,
and they already checked
my ID so...

[slow music playing]

Is that a tent?

Mmm-hmm.

This feels wrong.

Sophie. We're camping.

Think of it like foraging.

This is camping-adjacent
at best.

Come on. Use your imagination.

Smells bad. It's uncomfortable.

You can go to the bathroom
anywhere you want.

Just like camping.

I think we need a view.

Titan.

Good choice.

Try Europa.

Then look away.

No.

That's exactly what it wants.

I can tell this is getting
painful for you.

Yeah.

Did you just break it?

No. Just wait.

It's the beginning.

Invisible strings just
pulling everything into place.

And celestial bodies just...

follow.

I think
the universe just ended.

-We should...
-I just...

You...

We should probably
get some sleep.

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

"Buy a small country."

"Kidnap Gary from
the coffee shop."

He never leaves.

"Get brain augmenting
chip installed."

Yeah. I wanna read other
people's minds.

This is
an impossible checklist.

-I deserve that.
-[chuckles]

Where are we?

We are about five minutes
from where I grew up.

It's basically
an illegal dump site.

My dad used to
bring me out here.

Cool.

It was so dangerous.

Like, exposed wires everywhere,
and broken glass,

and I got electrocuted,
like, 100 times.

-That's awesome.
-Yeah.

And it smelled terrible.

Like, so bad.

We were gonna save the world,
one broken thing at a time.

I loved it.

<i>You said you wanted</i>

No.

I'll see you soon.

<i>I'll see you when you land.</i>

Walt.

Huh?

Tell me what you think.

I'm gonna hide
in one of these storage boxes
with this O2 canister.

When you find me,
in one of the storage units...

in about...

two-and-a-half...

Let's say two hours,
just to be safe.

I can't.

Are you afraid that
I'm gonna be dead?

No. Walt.

Look, if the box smells like
a dead body...

just keep walking.

I can't help you anymore.

I'm sorry.

But this is my life.

I can't risk it.

Calvin...

is here.

His family...

My family is here.

And Ginny is here.

Stop acting like our situations
are even remotely the same.

Right.

You're not supposed to be here.

And you are?
'Cause you can buy a ticket.

That's not fair.

You know what's not fair?

Try getting this close
to your dreams

and having someone tell you

you're not good enough
37 times.

Or meeting the girl
of your dreams

the night before she goes
to another planet,
or having to work...

Wait.

What?

How long have you
and Ginny been together?

Since freshmen year-ish.

How "ish"?

The night before she left
for Mars-ish.

[breathing heavily]

I'm gonna throw up.

No, don't do that,
'cause then I'm gonna throw up.

I can't believe
how selfish you are.

You are so obsessed

with escaping
your average existence

that you would blow up my life,
her life, for what?

For some sort of adventure?

For some stupid journal entry?

Sophie, I couldn't blow up
your life if I tried.

You're living his life.


Do you think
he's gonna move for you?

Do you think he's gonna go back
to Earth for you?

That he's not going to get
offered a better job,

and you're gonna go along
with it, like you always do?

You don't know
anything about him.

I actually do.

I've had to be him.

He's never gonna
meet you halfway.

He's never going to follow you.

You're a coward, Sophie.

Someday...

when that stupid journal
is filled...

you're gonna flip through it
and realize

just how pointless it all was.

Sophie...

I'm here because
I am wanted here.

You are here because no one
cares where you are.

<i>You will be kept here</i>
<i>until the return launch.</i>

<i>If you cannot afford</i>
<i>an attorney,</i>

<i>one will be provided for you.</i>

<i>There are currently</i>
<i>no human attorneys on Mars.</i>

If you're not here
to rescue me,

can you just leave?


What? How are you here?

I know a guy.

You know a guy?

This is Edgar.

'Sup?

Hey, guy. [chuckles]

Two minutes?

He's awesome.

You know what?

He is awesome.

Wow. [chuckles]

He is also my boyfriend.

My new boyfriend.

Oh.

You're dating my guard?

You followed me to Mars
after one night.

Kind of needed to start dating
a security guard.

Just to be clear...

you're not here to rescue me?

No.

But I did bring you
some company.

Ripley?

Oh, my God. Hi.

What are you doing here?
I thought you were arrested.

[knocking at door]

Time to go.

You'll be okay, Walt.

I mean, we both know
who you're really in love with.

Mars.

Mars.

And you made it.

More or less.

It says his application
was rejected like
100 times.

-Wow, 100 times?
-37.

I don't understand why someone
would wanna be somewhere
they do not belong.

-Yeah, you've got a point.
-Well, I think it's exciting.

Did you and the stowaway
cross paths, Sophie?

-No.
-No?

He must've been hiding.

-Really?
-In the air ducts or something.

-Wow. Can you just imagine?
-That is so stupid.

So, any idea what
you're gonna do

now that you're here?

I recommended her for a spot
on my team.

What?

Well, they love you for it.

You're totally qualified
and they're always looking
for young candidates

who can carry out
the next phase.

The next phase?

Yeah, the 12-year
life-cycle trials.



Did you just talk?

It's time to go.

Gary?

Is that you?

I didn't really think
the cat could talk.

Clear?


Copy.


Hello?


Okay.

Ripley.


Holy shit. It's you.

Leon Kovi.

I have that same picture
right by my bed.

That sounded weird.

I've thought about meeting you
for a really, really long time.

As have I.

What?

I have been monitoring
your progress

since you first entered
that escape pod back on Earth.

Oh, shit.

[man 1]<i> Bob,</i>
<i>you seeing this kid?</i>

[man 2]<i> Yep,</i>
<i>kid thinks he's invisible.</i>

You have cameras everywhere?

[man 1]<i> Bob says,</i>
<i>everybody just act like</i>
<i>you don't see him.</i>

you arrest me?

Well, I ran a profile
and the risk of you impacting
the journey

in a meaningful way
was below zero

which I didn't even think
was mathematically possible,

but it was,
it was a negative number, Walt.

There was some concern
that you would die
in the air ducts.

And the smell
of your rotting carcass

might disturb
some of the paying guests.

Bets were made.

I won.

That girl had nothing
to do with it.

-Walt!
-She did. But I forced her.
Not, like, forced her.

Blackmail. Light blackmail.

There is no such thing
as "light blackmail," okay?

There's no diet blackmail.
You blackmailed her, it's fine.

So, what happens now?

Well, the board has voted
to write this off
as a security systems test.

Ship you back to Earth

and tie you up
in so much legal trouble

that the world at large
will never hear from you again.

my own escape pod?

Walt, I hate the board.

So, I leaked
the security footage.

I shared your whole journey
with the world.

Oh. You what?


Look how happy it makes people.

I'm told it's called
"Walt-ing."

She's Walt-ing. He's Walt-ing.
They're all Walt-ing.

Walt-ing?

I, myself, can't Walt.
I have a bad back.

But Alan here has Walted.
Haven't you, Alan?

I am hiding. I am a sneaky,
sneaky human boy.

It's very, very fresh.

And now the board
is terrified of a PR backlash.

Please, sit.

You remind me
of a young me, Walt.

Emotionally, that is.

Intellectually,
it's more of an apples to...

whatever a much
smarter fruit is.

What's a smarter fruit, Walt?

Papaya?

Papaya! Yes.

I'm the papaya.

Do you know why the papaya
came to Mars, Walt?

Taxes?

No, I'm a billionaire, Walt,
I don't pay taxes.

I bet the papaya came
for the exact same reason
as the simple little apple.

Love?

Love? How old are you?

No.

You wouldn't settle
for the relentless

onslaught of the quotidian
that is life on Earth,

so you came here...

-[scoffs]
-to Mars.

This is not just a playground
for the wealthy, Walt.

It's a continuation
of our species' rich history

of curiosity and exploration.

Now, we need the public
and our investors
to understand that.

I think that you and I

could help each other.

You, a barista.

Assistant barista.

A barista's assistant.

Unremarkable in every way.

Truly middle of-the-road,
by all metrics.

Okay, I got it.

Stowing away
for an historic journey

against impossible odds,

secretly facilitated by me,
of course,

to discover something
that just might make
his meaningless little life

just a smidgeon,
just a tickle more meaningful.

Now, that is a story
people wanna hear, Walt.

Oh, what's this?

Walt, this has your name on it.

-This is a contract.
-Contract?

Ceding control of your likeness

to Kovi Industries
for exclusive use

in promotional materials

in perpetuity across
all universes,
known and unknown.

And in exchange...

you may stay here.

Are you serious?

Welcome to Mars, Walt.

â™ª<i> When I see the signs</i>
<i>Of pastâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Along my wayâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> I sometimes think of youâ™ª</i>

<i>â™ª While I'm wondering â™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Which mountains</i>
<i>I should climbâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> You're in everything I doâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> And we don't knowâ™ª</i>

Gary!

Gary!

â™ª<i> About tomorrowâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> In your eyesâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> A light is showingâ™ª</i>

solved world hunger
with my money, Walt?

Sure. Dozens of times over.

But don't you think it's better
that I came to Mars

to inspire the next generation
of young people

-to solve world hunger?
-[Alan] Looking good, guys.

How handsome.

-Sure.
-Yes, I agree.


â™ª<i> When I was youngâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> I let the darkness</i>
<i>Drag me downâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> But I'm not afraid</i>
<i>These daysâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> And we don't knowâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Where we're goingâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> You're with me nowâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Broken shadowâ™ª</i>


What are they doing down there?

Preparing the return vessel
for launch.

At the conclusion
of each orbital cycle,

the humans celebrate
their domination
of this lifeless planet.

After the festivities,

broken objects of little value
are sent back to Earth

for long-term storage.

You mean, garbage?

Yes.

Like sexual reproduction,

making garbage brings humans
great happiness.

But looking at it
causes deep shame.

It must be hidden.

Are we supposed to be here?

No.

I have asked you to return
to the habitat 11 times.

All right, Gary.

You win.

I am Victor.

[chuckles softly]

Hey, Ga... Victor?

Yes, Walt?

I'm gonna need some tools.

I don't even understand
why you wanna go to this thing.

It's the return party.

It's gonna be fun.

Plus, you can't work
all the time.

Which reminds me,

when can I tell them
you can start?

Start what?

The job.

With my team.

I don't know
if it's the right fit.

Um...

It's the perfect fit.

I mean, it's the same schedule.

I still have to finish
my thesis anyway so...

Yes, I know,

but, well,
you don't need it anymore.

You're here.

You have a job offer.

You can graduate without it.
You know, it's the past.

It's not the past.

It's supposed to be the future.

My future.

[upbeat music playing]

Yeah, no.

Good stuff, guys.

Shoot me in the face.
That is getting old.

Oh! It almost came
to that, honey, trust.

I voted to eject you,
but Kovi, he's a softy.

You knew the whole time too?

Walt, I have an IQ of 165

and I can pilot
a four billion-dollar
spaceship--

Through an asteroid belt. Yeah.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

So, how you enjoying Mars?

Honestly, I thought
it would be different.

I thought that I would get here

and I would be changed
or something.

But now I'm here
and it's exactly the same.

Walt, it doesn't matter
how far you travel,

you can never escape yourself.

Did you just come up with that?

No, bitch.
That is a very common phrase.

-How have you not heard
that before?
-Never heard it.

Thank God you pretty,
'cause you dumb.

You pretty, but you dumb.

I'm gonna talk
to somebody smarter.

â™ª<i> I love you because you have</i>
<i>Those Polaroids of meâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Inside your nightstand â™ª</i>

I should go say hi to the team.

Oh. Okay.

â™ª<i> You're understanding</i>
<i>When I'm too shyâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> To show my skinâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> You still la-love me anywayâ™ª</i>

Hey.

Is that supposed
to make us even?

No.

You gotta pay for that.

So, where is the amazing Ginny?

She is with the amazing Edgar.

Her new boyfriend.

You were right, though.

She was just an excuse.


I'm sorry.

For everything.

So, um, you sticking around
for a while?

Uh, yeah, looks like it. You?

Yeah, looks like it.

That's too bad.

â™ª<i> You were right â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can we take more Polaroids â™ª</i>

â™ª<i> For you to hide?â™ª</i>


Oh.

<i>â™ª Goodbye, earthling</i>
<i>Say hello to the Moon â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'll miss you lots.</i>
<i>We'll miss your thoughts â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But not your C02 â™ª</i>


Nothing.

Just something silly
someone gave me.

Sophie.

You know...

nothing could ever change

how much we care for you.

No matter what happens
between you and Calvin.

Nothing's gonna happen.

Well...

if it did,

we're your family,

your constant.

You're allowed to change.

Wouldn't it be, like,
crazy awkward?

I think I know my son
better than anyone.

He's already crazy awkward.


Sophie,

go, wander.

Figure out what you want.

We're not going anywhere.

Hey.

Hey.

Can we talk?

I'm so sorry.

Launch logistics,
everyone's yapping in my ear.

Where were we?

Ad campaign.

Right.

Walt,

do you remember how I told you,
you could stay?

Yeah?

Well, we just finished
the first run

of our new campaign
and there's been
a change of plans.

Seriously?

Can I please just have
my own escape pod?

How about
your very own spaceship?

What?

We're sending you to Ceres.

It's a tiny,
little dwarf planet

in the main asteroid belt
between us and Jupiter.

And you are gonna be
the very first person

to ever set foot on her.

Again, what?

We've set up an outpost.

And it's time
for a ribbon cutting.

You're gonna set up the ribbon,
you're gonna cut the ribbon.

It's gonna be very exciting.
We want you there.

That's... That's amazing.
Thank you.

Hmm.

But, why me?

-Can I be honest with you?
-Yeah.

People cannot get over
how average you are.

It's like a superpower
or something, [chuckles]

I don't know what it is.

They look at you,
and they think,

"If this guy can do it,

then I can do
literally anything."

I'll take it.

Great. Good choice.

Listen, you should
probably get in touch
with your family, friends

or anyone
who's important to you,

'cause you're not gonna
see them for a few years.

[phone ringing]

I gotta take this. Sorry, Walt.

Hello.

Yeah, I just ran it by him.

Yeah, he's happy.
He's super happy.

It'll be an adventure.

He's gonna be like
the Little Prince.
He'll be great.

Hey, Alan?

Yes, Walt.

Could you place a call
for me, please?

Of course.
Who would you like me to call?

Sophie Tsukino.

I'm sorry.

Sophie Tsukino is no longer
registered as a resident.

What?

She is the sole passenger
on today's return shuttle
to Earth.

My records indicate
she has already boarded
the ship.

[sighs softly]


This ship smells so bad.

Walt.

Actually it makes sense.
It's literally filled
with garbage.

Sir, that seat is for
authorized personnel only.

I know, I'm sorry. Okay.

Wait, how do I...

-It's the button directly--
-I can't see.

-Sorry.
-Just hold the button.
No, no, no.

Just hold the down button.
The same thing you did
to get here.

I got it. Sorry. I got it.

Expect a fine.

Really?

Walt?

Sophie?

What are you doing here?

I'm following you.

Back to Earth.

Even though
I didn't invite you,

or even tell you I was leaving.

Making it
all the more romantic?

You literally did
the exact same thing
for another girl last month.

Okay, yes.

I did recently travel across
the universe for love.

No, no, not love.

You barely knew that girl.

Correct.

But I do know you.

You're the most
frustratingly, brilliantly,

-contradictorily...
-Not a word.

...annoyingly talented person
I've ever met.

Every time I'm with you,
you make me feel so dumb.


In the best way possible.

I'd rather be Mars's garbage
flying back to Earth

than boring old Walt,

flipping rocks on Mars alone.

So you're really gonna
give up this whole
Mars adventure thing?

I'm not giving up anything.

You're the adventure.

Ah! Goddammit.

What?

You come in here
with no plan at all

just expecting everything
to magically work out

and then somehow,

you pull that line
out of your ass?

Yeah.

You are so annoying.

I know.

â™ª<i> Every once in a whileâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Well, you just gotta smileâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> At the way the stars alignâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Don't look down</i>
<i>'Cause your dreamsâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Aren't as far as they seemâ™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Now they're lighting up</i>
<i>The night for you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's some kind of magic â™ª</i>

â™ª<i> What love can doâ™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't you know it's strange</i>
<i>But it's true â™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Now everything's looking upâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Just like I told you</i>
<i>It wouldâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> And the birds are singingâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Come take my handâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> 'Cause there's no limit</i>
<i>To what we can doâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> I could be the sunshineâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> You could be my</i>
<i>Wild wild blueâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> You could be my</i>
<i>Wild wild blueâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> When your eyes</i>
<i>Catch the lightâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> As your dreams are in sight â™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Don't hide yourself from</i>
<i>Your true loveâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> Come take my handâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> 'Cause there's no limit</i>
<i>To what we can doâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> I could be the sunshineâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> You could be my</i>
<i>Wild wild blueâ™ª</i>

â™ª<i> You could be my</i>
<i>Wild wild blueâ™ª</i>
