BASIS OF RESEARCH OF THE U.S. ARMY
CODE NAME: THE SAND TRAP

LOCATION: IRAQ

This all sucks.

Can not wait to go back
to Arizona, my,

which is cool.
Jesus, but what the heck?

What was that?

It came from inside?

Can not see, and you,
can you see anything?

Let me check your windows.
What ...?!

What is he doing?

Something is not right, man.
I'm not like this.

SUBSTANCE CONTAGIOUS

Stop the vehicle!

Captain Hall?
Captain Hall!

Calm down, sir.

What's he got?

We must leave here now.

What we have here, Stanf?

Some kind of medicine.

I told them that my research was not
completed. You do not do a thing like this ...

and hopes to have good results.

Is marked "Biohazard."
We have a security breach.

I'll just say once Captain Hall,
turn off the vehicle and exit.

Shit!

E V I L U T I O N

Home sweet home.

RENT-SE.
TALK with the landlord.

Darren Tyler. Welcome
to Nekropoliten. This way.

How old is this building?

Nobody really knows. Documents
originals have been lost for many years.

Some say this building
just appeared one day ...

at some time near the
World War II.

Someone had to build it.

You think?

Oh, just one floor to sink.

40th
Beware of the bodies.
I'm not kidding.

Yes I am.

Good night, Madeline.

Sorry.
Sorry.

Let me introduce you to Darren Tyler.
A new tenant.

I'm Maddie.

Nice to meet you.

And by the way, the machine
Washing is spoiled another see.

As the elevator.

What a novelty.
Welcome to the neighborhood, Mr. Tyler.

Good woman.
Having problems with men.

If you do not mind me asking,
what to do in life, Mr. Tyler?

I'ma science teacher.
The school of "Layden.

This explains the need
of affordable housing.

Children ... What can you do?

That does not make them evil?

You're funny.
You'll adjust you right here.

We are near the laundry?

Actually, no. Ah, thou
referes to the smell? It is chlorine.

This part of the building was built
within a pool.

Obviously left chemicals
back. As the wall of your apartment.

Fantastic.

The smell is stronger on some days than
in others. You will get used.

Sorry for that. I know it is
hard to believe but ...

we are having some problems
with electricity.

Probably not what
you're accustomed to.

No, it's bigger than I thought.

Then it will just be you? Neither Mrs. Tyler,
do not mind if I ask?

No, just me. I think it's
my fate to live alone.

As the poem
old sailor.

What did you say?

You know the poem about a sailor,
kills an albatross a bird of prophecy.

And it is cursed and forced to
use the bird around the neck,

as a reminder of what he did.

"There will come a day when Mal
look in the eyes ...

young and old.

Instead of a cross, the albatross that
is hanging on my chest. "

I do not understand.

Everyone on the ship die except him.
It is his curse.

Being the master of the "ship of death".
It must be awful to live with such a burden.

80th
Hiding from humanity because
a mistake in the past.

I'll have to read this poem
one day.

Well, I'm not going to do
lose more time.

The rent is charged on the first
day of the month. Cash.

Closing the doors at sunset
to keep out unwanted ...

So, are you sure you do not
forget to use the keys.

And our other problems?

You have one lock.
I suggest that the uses.

Good to have you with us, Mr. Tyler.

Lamps replaced.
LOCK YOUR DOOR!

Do you want to kiss or something
similar. What's that?

Stop it, I do not
like to share.

Do not you like to share?

They all share something!

It's the first thing you learn in the garden
childhood. Share the toys.

Can lower a bit?

Hey, whitey, what you think
are you doing playing on my radio?

Sorry, man, but it's late
too much and was trying to sleep.

Really? This is a beautiful story,
but why not increase the radio?

What a beautiful girl.
Now get out of here.

Let not this the
prevents them from dancing.

Delivery to Darren Tyler!

Wait! Shit!
Coming!

Hey, wait, I'm here!

As if he had any day.

Thanks for waiting.

Have a nice day.

107th
Who was that
commissioned the honky naked?

Yes .. Hello!
We know each other last night ...

Who are you talking about,
vanilla pudding?

Hey, man. He is calm.

Just swallow.
We had this block.

And since we do not like you, bitch.

Sorry.

Just so you remember, man.

This is the "Random", it is
one killer in the street.

Call me "Killer Bee" because
my heart is wrapped in poison.

And that crazy shit there
is the "Mark Asia."

He shat in the body of an enemy in
his funeral. Just because it is crazy.

He kills you and then kills again
just so we can watch.

Understand:
Matador, Poisonous, Crazy.

Hey, what's going on? Curtis, Steve, Ben?
They are bothering you?

Stay out, sister.

Wow, talk about bad for a
type who cried ...

watch a movie with me
last week.

Why do you have to do that, man?

You can not decide the
color of your pants?

It's true ...

Let's get outta here.

Bitch!
Hey, hey, hey!

Sorry.

Thanks, Maddie.

Anything ...

Darren.

Darren, ok.

Thank you.

Smell of cleanliness.

What?

The chlorine.

I've got used to it.
Well, thanks for the help.

I can not believe someone
going to live down here.

This place really chills me.

Not so bad.

Transmits some vibration ... of the past.
Many bad things happened here.

You will be the committee
welcome.

Look, sorry. Obviously you and
mice have been working here ...

then why not follow me
a dinner tonight.

E. ..
whether you want you can wear pants.

You are very kind but ...
Ok See you at 6:00.

Coming!
Wait a minute!

Oh, shit!

Hello

Hello

Dressed to impress.
Seem desperate ...

Yes.

You came empty handed?

Hmm .. excuse.

I'm kidding.

RESEARCH BASE OF USA # 1809
CODE: "FIRE STAR"

LOCATION: NEW MEXICO

Good morning, sir!
Sgt Kollins, at your service.

At ease, sergeant.

Yes, sir.

Sit.

Drink?
No, thank you, sir.

You can change your mind
after seeing this.

THE U.S. MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OPERATION
"Sand Storm" ULTRA SECRET.

What are you doing here still?
We have to evacuate the area immediately.

Ah, now I understand. You are here to document
our failure. This is your job, son?

Of course it is. And you liked
our "army of the dead"?

What? All you dreamed?
Son of a bitch.

Let me tell you this.
They are learning, adapting.

Can never be controlled. Are
recreate themselves, from bottom to top.

Soon they will be like us or
we will become like them.

Anyway, this is the next
step in the evolution of the human race.

Not the end, son.
Not even close.

This is a good beginning
for all humanity.

Can not be held. They live.
Are you listening? Live!

It's no suicide bomber who
was communicated to the media, do you?

All history has
both sides, Gabriel.

Always two sides, sir.

This scientist ...
a crazy motherfucker.

This nigga could well have started
hell on earth. Take a look.

Yes, sir.

The report says that everything was destroyed.
It was what we thought.

Until we receive the report,
identifying what is left.

Were all arrested, except
Captain Darren Hall.

Tyler would be the assistant?

Exactly.

Any clues?

Last page. Recently took
money from an electronic box.

I do not understand. By simply
do not hold this kind?

We do not know the purpose of it.
And do not scare him now.

The result could be catastrophic.

He's just a man.

Not the man who worries me.
It is what it has.

Gabriel?

Yes, sir?

I need a man with skills
Special to complete this mission.

Cirurgicalmente accurate
if you will.

Are you saying what I
I think you're saying?

This is serious business,
thou understand?

I understand.
Never disappoint you, sir.

Good man. Has already received orders.
Will leave tomorrow morning. I suggest you start reading.

I'll be in touch.
Yes, sir!

Sgt.

Yes, Colonel?

Fast and strong.
Nothing can bazaar.

So do we
work, is not you?

You're probably asking yourself what a
nice girl like me doing in a place like this.

Actually, he was asking me how
you handle those wacky gangsters.

Who? Those types of before? They
arm themselves in strong, but ... are not.

Cook for them and they protect me.
My mother always said:

"The way to win the heart of a
man is through the stomach. "

Why are you in such a place?

Am I hide.

Of what?

Of life. I got tired of the vicious circle.
After my divorce ...

218th
I decided see what was "out there"
and did not like what I found.

And here I am ... to expect the
prince charming to call me.

They still meet at home?

All my friends say:
"Madi, forget television,

and dating back ... but for some
reason, my TV ...

seems to be much more reliable.

A toast to that.

Then science teacher ...
What made you choose this path?

When I was 15, was
late back to school

And storm fell.
He was crossing a field ...

And that lightning came, it was amazing.
I was struck with such power and beauty.

From that moment I knew
should there be a God watching over us.

So when was that
lost his faith in God?

And who was it who said
that I lost faith?

When my mother died.
She was well e. ..

suddenly died.

My father said it was a heart attack,
but I looked at his autopsy ...

and found that it was a suicide ...

And then you came to
medical university?

Actually, I was fortunate to work
with research for the Army.

Was in the army?

What a fascinating life had
in such a short time.

Oh, come on, we almost
the same age.

But my greatest achievement
is to program the television.

And that's something.

Program it herself.

I'm kidding.
It was a joke.

Very funny ...
It even has sad eyes.

You know, I have an apartment to clean up.
I really gotta go.

Okay.

Thank you.
I had fun.

Hey, maybe we can mix our
clothes in the laundry one day.

If the smell of chlorine does not get you.

This was very good, Madeleine.

Bitches love men in uniform.
I'll get some real pussy.

253rd
That's right, man. And here
will render us good money.

Hey, man. Perhaps it is better not to sell.
We need this.

No, man. Do not want to be caught
with no gun stolen.

We have to sell that shit fast.

Okay, guys, it was very funny.
Give me back.

Return what?

The uniform he is wearing and the weapon.

We find that here.

Yes, in my apartment.

And then? There used to be our
place before you come and take.

You not staying in the building?

264th
That means nothing.

I do not mind the uniforms, just give me
the weapon before anyone gets hurt.

I told you not
We have no weapons.

Why don
of our front, soldier?

I'm not leaving without the gun.

So, I guess you are not going to leave.

How about, man? We have a problem?
You ripped off his uniform or not?

A gun also.

Really? He stole your gun?
Really? Stole or not?

I do not know what he is talking about, random.
The guy is crazy in the head or something.

Ok ok.

Give me the damn gun!

Hey, better cool it, whitey. This is the
wrong thing to do here. Understand?

Mess with my staff is
mess with my family.

And you will not want to mess with my
family, ok? I kill you, man.

Did you hear?

Hey, Entrages him the uniform!

Sorry, man.

Stop playing.
And you stand there with a bad guy.

Here's your fantasy, soldier.

Toma and leaves.
Fast.

That's right.

People like that are
ruining the neighborhood.

Hey, man, enough!
What's your problem, man?

What you took?
That's what I'm talking about, man.

My soldiers,
my soldiers.

Those idiots are
causing problems?

They just broke into my apartment
and stole some things.

You can not invade this place.
You must let him open again.

Must be aware of this, Mr. Tyler.

It seems to be an intelligent man.

Why not put your brain to work this
from time to time and remember to lock the door?

It is good sometimes encourages it.
That's your uniform?

No, it's a friend of mine. He died in Iraq.
I keep it as souvenir.

You served in Iraq?

There were many souls who have managed
back there. She was lucky.

I think so.
Good night.

Sold?

That's right.

I'll say this. Why
girls do not divide it among themselves?

That's right, girl.

What is the Random, man?

Caught it.
We use two weapons.

I have no gun, man!

As if giving a gun to
a crazy shit like you ...

Who needs guns
when you have it here?

Hey, man, you got some change?
Sorry, no.

No matter.
I'll get something to eat.

What these bags have?
Apples?

They make me ill.

Is someone after you?

Me too.
I worked at Area 51.

It's all true. Very strange things.
Maybe some broccoli.

Fruit pies. And a bunch of support
athletic male. I'll eat this here.

It's always good to accommodate tomatoes
when trying to sleep.

Good And you can go,
the type is all gone.

Nobody loves you, does it?

No, but it is not news
signal that all is well.

Hmm .. is over my
Stock of cliches.

Yes, mine too ...

Shit, Curtis! You're bleeding!
Darren, help me!

Can I help?

Yes Take me to the shit
my room, my!

You need not go
to room

precise point, I can
give them in my apartment.

Let me help you.

Get away from me, shit!

Fuck off, fuck!
It's okay, do I resolve this.

What do you want?
You are some kind of crazy?

I am a doctor, come on
I can heal.

Get off of me ...

I assume that they are not
good news, Sgt.

The liquidator says that he
is not to live there.

Probably trying to protect him.
But are you sure he's there, right?

No, he's here. The number of
weapon that police officers brought ...

coincides with what
was used in Iraq.

This is taking too long, Collins.

So I find it to
situation will be resolved.

Do we need another event
terrorist fix this?

Not required.

Ok But I want it resolved
tonight. Understand?

Yes, sir.

Tonight.

Yes, sir.

Soldier!
Get this bush here!

Hey, Doc. I noticed that has many
junk in the apartment.

This is really happening?
Crack are you doing? Stone?

Research.

Search? Ok You know, I am
the branch of pharmacy of street ...

why do not you let me help
with distribution ...

At the end of the day is it
that counts, right?

You have many scars.

Yes Let's say people do not always
agree with me when I'm right.

It's your shirt? I'll have to use that shit up there?
Well, I think that should serve as yet.

Not my brand
unique, but realize it.

Sorry.

You are very good, man.
Okay.

Random, I need to ask a question.
Why this gangster life?

We all want to fit in, okay?

There can be a form of fraternal?

Let me explain something, man.

Everything revolves because of money.
If you had money ...

you would not be in this place, do you?

So, all major
achievements of humanity ...

can be summarized as
who has more money?

That's right. The money was before
and we will continue to exist after us.

I'll tell you one thing, Doctor.
The money keeps the world turning.

Money is the true
meaning of life.

This is not true.

Let me decide what is
true or not.

But I'll tell you this, the
I consider this the points ...

forget our past.
That's right.

I like you, doctor.
Beats here. Bate, my.

Not mine, it hits harder!
You are a man or a bitch?

That, girl.

Around here some days for
to take a look at these points.

No, Random. The meaning of life
is the answer to death.

If I could explain the
difference between friendship and grief.

This will hurt a bit.

That's right, buddy.

If only you could speak ...

I am! I am! Easy!

Random! Your body is
to adapt, right? Relax!

I'm with you, okay? Relax!
Lie down. Rests.

I'm with you, Random.
Lie down.

I'm with you.

Come on, Random! Stay with me!

Come, relax.
Relaxes. Relax.

Anyway. Stay with me, man.
Ok? Stay with me.

Stay with me, stay with me.
Come on. Come on.

As a man, ok?
As a man.

Rest.
I'll get water, okay?

Hello, Darren.

Hey, I was thinking it could be due ...
a bit ... a bottle of water.

Sorry, was doing a cleaning.
But usually do it naked.

Huh?

I'm kidding.
Go in, go to fetch water.

No one has anything
interesting in this neighborhood?

That's what I mean.

Do not touch the blue. Hold still!
Or you'll drown in there peeing.

You, my beautiful.
Ah, yes.

That thing you down?
Must be good!

Let's party!

Skip and his
gangster shit.

You are in a hurry?

More or less ... but I think
I have a minute.

Something is bothering you?

411th
You heard those shots earlier?

In this neighborhood scares me
if I did not listen.

Something happened?

This is a .... long history.

I have more wine.

Ah, yes.

Come on.

Who would want a digital clock from the 80s?
Nor has either a calculator, my.

And it was there, man?
You got your money?

Here is my part of the weapon.

The Random got that money.
I need 300 bucks from you.

How do I get this
amount of money, man?

I know. With gay porn.

No, man. I'm a mess.
Where is random anyway?

Is probably a few "Chicas"
hot babes out there, right?

Is probably in the basement with
those cunty now.

"Cunty?
Yes!

You're weird, man.

You know what really is?
When that soldier moved ...

there lost
our hiding place, you know?

Where should we take the
Our whores now?

We have to have a conversation
very serious with the soldier.

He has to go!

I agree, man!

What did you say? He is making me
put the hat. What did I say?

Oh, no, they made you
put the hat now.

A game with a ball.

Hey aberration!
Get the fuck out!

Soldier!
Come out to play!

Stop it!

Soldier, we need to talk.

The Random is the largest travel.
That's what I'm talking about.

And then, Random?

I knew it. He manufactures stone.
He better get us.

This is crazy.

Using it to test on animals.
It's sickening.

Look at Random.
What's wrong with him?

Have you been smoking the shit home
the soldier? He did this to you?

He looks all fucked up. Hey, man, you okay?
You still have most of this shit?

Stop it, man.
Let's get him here.

Come on, Random. Arise.
It is not right.

Oh, shit.

Gotcha, Random.

But what the heck the
soldier did to him?

And even in front of the television.
Sorry, television.

Really did not want to go but
I have something I need to do.

You need company?

It's okay. Just someone
I need to see.

Is everything okay?

Remember those shots before?
Random was the ... he was hit ...

I had to give him points.
What are you doing?

I need to see it, okay?

Him .. resting, had a bit
fever but has improved. He's fine.

He needs to go
a hospital, Daren.

Maddie!

Where's Curtis?

He must have improved and gone.
I told you, everything is fine.

Maddie, please, can explain.

Ridden it here. So what are you
to get extra money?

A sell drugs to kids?

Do not be ridiculous!
This is for my classes!

This is very prepared for the kids
sixth grade. Tell me the truth!

This is not a meth lab.
This is all for scientific research!

've Seen many bad things in this neighborhood,
but always did a blind eye.

475th
If you're doing anything
for our kids ... I swear

You are exaggerating too much!

You have not seen anything.

That was not necessary.

Keep your camera, Darren.

Damn! Where is it?
Where is it?

Mr. Tyler, an interesting choice.

Use the name of his mentor,
Captain Hall?

Of his mentor dead. Sure, you thought
would be long to find out, right?

Ok, so you found me.

Can I join?

I have an alternative?

No, you have no alternative.
It seems we are having a party, huh?

Stop with the psychological drama.
Take what she came for.

Oh, we have a conversation.

Oh, Maddie, sorry. That's crap
elevator is out of service again.

I have more bad news.
The washing machine is also.

What a novelty.
Honey, you okay?

Men. What else?

Men? Who needs them? They go to
zoo toss peanuts to their parents.

Did you know that it is
better without them, dear?

Maybe you're right Mrs. Harris.
But I have to go. Good day.

Okay, honey. If you know where you need
find me. Here at the end of the corridor.

Okay.

Damn kids and their
horror movies! Jesus!

Mr. Stencil?
It's okay in there?

Oh, that sucks.

You puxaste much the pipe,
Random huh?

Are you still there, man?
Can you hear me?

Look if you are with the gun.

This is totally fucked up, man.

Hey, you saw that?
He tried to bite me!

What has given you?

Hey, I just calm down!

If you do that again I will have to
bursting with thy head, man!

No matter the past
we had together.

What did fumaste, man?

Grab that phone cord, man!

This is crazy!

Give me that.
The other side.

Stop, Random.
Roll Fast!

What is this shit he smoked?
You are all crazy! We'll get you more, man!

Shut up, Random!
I'm trying to think!

That's right, man.

We're fine.
Are not we?

I see that you were doing
homework.

Why do not you sit?

I suppose you are asking what
what happened after you left.

Actually, no.
I saw the explosion.

411 people lost
their lives that day.

Thou shouldst be the 412.

Is not there.

For what appears nothing could
survive in this refrigerator.

She is on vacation.

What? Very funny.

Since I will die anyway
I know why ...

still has one so
interested in this project?

We know that the way of life
can not be controlled.

Someone seems to believe that you
found out something else.

I believe that Tyler left you a specimen
thus thou mightest continue the work.

I'll tell you what we found,
a form of extraterrestrial life ...

who simply want to learn.

Took account of the mind and body
American citizens ...

and used them as a
weapon against us.

I do not care if they come from
Middle East or the Moon!

Terrorism is terrorism.
Must be arrested, quickly and cleanly.

Why is the government asked Tyler to turn them
weapons instead of just destroying them, huh?

Now who's the terrorist?

You threaten our
way of life!

Only defends himself!

Are you aware that if
this specimen is spread ...

will possess victim after victim, until
all humanity is destroyed?

Not if we win back their trust.
Can not understand this?

Can understand this: You say where
or is gonna blow your mind!

We search, brick by brick
until we find. Choose.

Anyway I will be
a dead man.

551st
Consider me as Gabriel
front doors of Paradise.

You can choose Heaven
or hell.

Soldier moves on to something
Random. He is sick.

Oh, that smell ...
Shit!

What's happening?
You're the police or what?

No, man, it's not the police.
Look at him, is the Army.

Cold as ice ...

Where is he now?

In our room upstairs.

Do not tell a military where it is
our apartment. You're an idiot?

Sorry, man.

Hey, hey, hey! I think we should go there
over to see your friend ...

No, my ...

We ourselves take care of
our comrades.

This plumb!

We can help you!

Or prefer to stay and we
shoot each other?

Which one?

Ok need not be
so angry with us.

Yeah, man. By that point the gun?
Just come talk! What the fuck!

Come on.

Move!

My God, Curtis!
You scared me!

Are you okay?

You are under the effect of what? Curtis,
why are you doing this to yourself?

What are you doing?

Nicky, what happens?

I do not know. My God, what is
your problem?

They can come!

No! Get off me!

Help me! Oh, my God!

My God ...

In God's name ...

He was here.
Was tied.

Shit, man! Everything went wrong
and now he is on the loose!

What was happening to him?

He was high, my!
It was crazy!

There was a release of
some black substance?

He is talking about that black goo.

Yes, he was drooling
a nasty black shit.

How do you know this, man?

We must get rid of these two.
Find that person and take care of it.

Nobody will get rid of anyone.
Let's you.

This is becoming annoying.

We can be helpful.

Why can not it go welts,
before they hurt someone?

Hey, man. Why do not we
for the upstairs?

I bet he went to the house
Maddie's. A hot babe ...

Or!

What do you, Darren? Are you selling
crack from door to door now?

Good night.

Who is that? Your bodyguard?
Impressive.

You know, I'm so busy, I ...

What happened to your hand?

I cut myself trying to get the knife
stuck in my back.

As I said, I'm busy.

Not to call him, Princess.
We are looking for Random. Him ..

You are not you feeling well.

I met him in the corridor,
an hour ago. One goes something?

I'ma doctor, and he may be suffering
of a fatal and contagious.

Contagious and fatal disease?

Yes.

This is the new slang
streets to Drugs?

We have to find it.

Can not make it.

616th
One more question. Hast release
some kind of substance than ...

something like a ...

It was dark.
I do not know, okay?

Sucks that he struck disgust ...

She slammed the door in my face ...
I'll show you ...

Take it easy, boy.

She is lying.

Do you have any idea where
your friend may have gone?

It was madness, it was there that he was.
He tried to bite me.

Perhaps the terrace.
We sometimes went there to enjoy.

Come on.

Your hand knows the popcorn
tail, man.

And as you know the Rays
like the tail of popcorn?

I'm just saying, man!

Come on, you two!

Hey, Random!

Shit, man, he is not here.
Maybe he was somewhere else.

633rd
He was very polished for
have gone anywhere else.

The reason it is so screwed
is what I want to know.

Done something
with it, soldier?

Yes, you did something with it,
sick son of a bitch?

Random contracted a virus
highly contagious.

I do not know how he contracted,
but he came to help me lose.

Wait a bit. The Random is sick and
was behind the soldier? Something is not right.

Give me your weapon now!

You talk seriously, man.
Again?

This is wrong.

What are you doing?
Wait!

Do not shoot! He is trying to communicate!
That was what I was saying! Trying to understand!

Random! Random!

Viste, Collins? It is a non-hostile environment
we are able to communicate with him ....

What the hell, man!

That's right, my,
now you ass out!

The son of a bitch shot me!

You have no more bullets, you idiot.

Come on! Had to do it!
I had no alternative!

He was the only one?
Yes.

What do you mean "The only ', man?
What have you done with the Random?

I told you I was sick!

The disease spread rapidly,
there was nothing they could do!

No chance, man!
Seriously!

He looked like those
things from the movies ...

Those who eat people, man!

As a zombie!
It's zombie!

He was not a zombie!

He was infected by a disease.

Whatever, man! We need a
ambulance to his body.

We do not need an ambulance.

We have much bigger problems.

Of course we have bigger problems!
Put a bullet in my leg, you idiot!

I need an ambulance!
What the fuck, man!

The shot was grazed. Just a few points.
Can I make it down there.

Ok
Fast.

After that me and you have a
transaction to complete.

You will not be giving orders.
Me end up with you ...

Of course I will!

And if you want to get out of this mess I suggest
you to do exactly what I say!

Mimimimimi ...
Fuck you, man!

I got you, man.

I hate this guy!

And then?
You work for the CDC?

We had a problem with insects once
this place was full of people from the CDC.

Do not move!
Listen!

You heard me, folks?
Insects!

You want to stop and listen?!
What?

I do not hear anything.

That's the problem.
Can not hear well.

Nor talk, nor fights, nor cries.

How is this place
dead.

Get out there! Get out now!

Jeff is the man!

Jeff is cool, man.
One of the friends of Random.

What is it, man?

Let him in!

What, mine?
Are you crazy fuck?

I'll count to three!
One, two, THREE!

What the hell, man!

What was that?

694th
Actually it was for you. If that one of
"The doctor and the monster" at us.

It turns out that a mixture of chlorine and
Ammonia can finish them off.

You hear that, folks?
Where is Mark? Where are you, man?

Who knows how many people
your friend has infected.

Hey, we have a missing man.

What?
Why you did not keep an eye on him?

Do not bother me, man.

Probably got scared
and returned to the apartment.

Great!
Hey, where are you going?

Hey, that does not look good.
We need go to the streets.

We came back from Asia Mark,
let's go with Mark Asia.

Do not have time for this shit.

I suggest you go open the door ...
Open it NOW!

I'm trying, man!

Get out, Hall!
This place is taken!

I go to the basement!
Chlorine has down there! And much!

When you want!

Want to trade places?

No! Shut up, man!
You are making me nervous!

Shit!
Where the hell is the Asia?!

Forget it.

No, man, we must look for it!

Are you sure
you wish to go back?

I do not care, man!
He would not let me back!

It's him!

Is not it.

It hit him!

He is infected.
You do not know, man!

Just think, he's out there with them, okay?
And they're not attacking. Why?

What do we do?

You have a gun?

SINDICER

Good evening, Mr. Tyler.
How can I help you?

There has been an accident. A worker
City asked me to warn you ...

a biochemical agent that malignant
was released in the building ...

and that no one should exit
until it is contained.

Wow, biochemical agent malignant?

Doubt that one of the city
can pronounce it.

Why not contact me?
Why go for you?

You are to participate
some prank?

The truth is that a way of life
extraterrestrial was dropped in your building.

It kills the host and has
body, reviving.

Like in that movie
"Kindred Souls"?

Ok, we'll try next. We
to be sure that no one ...

exit the building by destroying
all those infected.

I told you, dude. No one enters or
leaves this building without the keys.

Now the dead can
handle keys, Mr. Tyler?

This is a serious thing.

Ok I'll join the fun. If this
form of extraterrestrial life is very ...

smart to bring back the dead ...

You do not think she'll find a
way out of here no matter how?

Unless ...

that you find a way to
kill all at once.

Please you gotta help me.

The more you look
to darkness, Mr. Tyler,

more likely to
something to see you back.

That's it?
No gun?

Knives are for combat,
weapons to sell.

That will not work.

What's happening?
What are these? They are zombies, right?

Technically this can they
by an extraterrestrial intelligence.

But they are
eat people, right?

That's right! They are eating people!
Did you find out!

So let's burn this
crap, man!

Most is not worth anything anyway.

Yes! They hate this thing!

Let's take it to the basement.
Do you have any thing to put it in?

Look at the garbage.

Begins to fill these things. One by one.
You have some effervescent tablet?

In the bathroom.

I still do not understand
What are you doing.

Just do what you have.

Whatever you are doing,
do it faster.

This will work, he believes.

They're right there, man.

Ok! Puts his hand on the neck
and begins to shake like that.

It's like a fire extinguisher.

That's right.
Come on!

Ready?

Mark, turn you
into zombie, man!

I'm in trouble, man.

Give me the knife.
Give me the knife!

Why, man?
Let's go!

Give me the knife.
This will delay them.

778th
How long, man?

Enough time.

Hall, opens the door!

Open the door, man!
Come on! Hurry!

Do not have much time.
What happened?

The entire building was destroyed, my!

They caught the Asia Mark!

Come on, get it.

Not going to get it, man!

No! Wait! The liquidator told me
that part was built ...

over an old swimming pool.

We can use the chlorine
have here, behind this wall!

This place has central ventilation?

Yes, when it works.

That's good. We have to get to
exhaust system, roof ...

and pour this mixture of ammonia and chlorine
ourselves and stop with all infected.

And not infected?

Collateral damage.
This place is gone.

A better question: How do we get
the roof with these things everywhere?

Help me with this table.

Earlier when he said that syringe
was the case for me to give one of ...

"The doctor and the Beast" the
did you mean by that?

In one experiment
there was a change.

The alien could form
successfully merge with the human.

So he was able to communicate?

Yes, but regressed in a few hours.

I know!
These things want to learn.

And in the end had to be destroyed.

Typical.
Welcome to the world of white!

I give blood by
my brothers extraterrestrials!

Shut up.

Why?
He could not be stopped?

It became clear that it was a
threat to anyone.

Hatred for the human race was
beyond perverse.

Authorities feared that thou
wert possessed, or even worse ...

loosened so that
in the population.

Time of change.

Sorry, they had reason.

We got company.

And now, Frankenstein?

Let's find something
to put it inside.

Hey, soldier.

You gotta be kidding ...
This can result.

Let's start filling these things
that we can get to the roof.

Here they come. Stick around.
Not aspire.

Come on! Move!

Come on, man!
Move!

Come on, man!
Put the mask.

He's dead!

Continues to rise!

Where are you going?

I have to see Maddie.
It may still be alive.

Do not be silly.

I have to be sure.

Hell, Hall! This is no time!
We have to get to the roof!

We do not have time for this!

My God, Hall!
Maddie!

Are you listening?

Maddie, please, not you. You're the last
person I wanted to hurt you.

Mr. Romance?
We have work to finish!

Maddie, sorry.
Are you okay?

Come quickly!
She goes with us!

You know that!

But I will not wait
whether it be late!

You are boring!

This place is full of them.

Let's continue.

Continues. I think they
have not seen us. That's right.

That's good. Continue.
It's okay.

Shit. I catch.
Go!

Just a few more steps.

Take that, grandpa!

Hall! One managed to escape!

Are you okay?

Begin to put there.
I'll turn on the fan.

I remember you.

She was infected.
Do not stop, I treat it.

Maddie! Maddie!
Do not do it!

No, no! Finish the job!
Do not stop!

ALL DOOR LOCK
THE SUNSET. Without exception.

Darren.
Darren.

Oh, my God.

Stay with me. Stay with us.
Do not fight.

Then you made a mistake. We
why we fight possessed free will.

We live as individuals!

Only the whole is perfect.
When you humans will accept that!

Not on your life.

DO NOT litter.
DRAIN THAT LEADS TO MAR.

SUBSTANCE CONTAGIOUS.

FOR RENT
Furnished Apartments - Talk to the liquidator.

"But even so, the fallen angel
becomes a malignant devil.

Yet even that enemy of God and men
had friends and associates in his desolation;

I'm alone. "
