This is 911, what is your emergency?

I need help.

My brother disappeared.

His name is Jacob Taylor, please...

Please help us!

Sir, can you tell me exactly what happened?

I shot him.

I shot a man and my brother just ran away.

And he said someone was
waiting for him in the woods.

Sir, I need you to calm down.

I need to know what happened exactly.

I don't know what's going on.

Please!

Send somebody!

Could you tell me the
address you're calling from?

Can you hear me?

Sir, can you hear me?

Sir, are you there?

Uncertainty pollutes everything.

It comes with a clockwork precision and

works without compassion.

And in the end we can't
do anything apart from

staring at the walls, or

wandering through the rooms

looking at the photos
that once meant so much.

But now

they only remind us of pain and

uncertainty.

I visited him on the 22nd of
November for the first time.

I mean my brother, Jacob.

Jacob Taylor.

Or JT as his friends call him.

Although...

as I think back

he barely had any friends.

At least I believe he lost
all of them by the end.

By the 24th of November.

The day when he disappeared
without a trace.

Jacob never enjoyed being in
the city, though it didn't show.

He tried to fit in and
put on a happy face, but

I often felt that something wasn't right.

We had already been
together for a while then

and he couldn't keep a secret.

You could easily see when he had problems.

What did you say when he came up with the idea of moving
to that godforsaken place and leaving everything behind?

At first I didn't like the idea of course.

I couldn't imagine myself being there.

I only agreed to move when his mother
was taken to the hospital.

I realized that he needed this whole thing.

And so that

perhaps

this could save our relationship.

It's been nearly four months
since our mother was hospitalized.

Sadly our dad had already passed away and

at the beginning we visited
mom nearly every weekend.

And one day one of these
sundays Mom got cerebral edema.

The neighbour found her and
called us immediately, but

we only saw her again on life support

lying in an induced coma.

JT didn't talk much.

Still I can say we became
some kind of friends.

He often helped me with my daughter,
sometimes he drove us around

sometimes we drove him around and

they also developed some kind of bond.

I knew about his mother

and all that shit he went through

and I dare say not many could
have had better than he did.

After a while he chose not
to work by car anymore.

He said he didn't want to cause an accident

by not being able to pay
attention to the road.

So I often waited for him after work
and took him to the hospital.

I often asked whether
I should go in with him

but he refused every time.

He said

he wanted to spend that time with
his mother, just the two of them.

And they needed privacy for that.

I was

shocked

when he told me he wouldn't
be coming to work anymore.

It's

as if everything that happened was tied
to that particular house and place.

As I've said I visited him on the 22nd

but Jacob had been already
there for a few days by then.

The price was really low, just
the fragment of the average price.

However it is also true that Jacob...

Jacob didn't have much
more money than that.

I had the feeling

he would have chosen the very same house even if he
hadn't had a cent more money than the exact price.

As he said

when he viewed the house

he instantly found peace.

He loved it immediately because as he said

he would be able to create
and relax there again.

I don't believe he saw what
was waiting for him there.

I could hardly name another
student who was like Jacob.

I'm not exaggerating when I say he was

interested in everything
and open to anything.

I taught him in more than one class.

I taught him creative writing,

stylistics,

dramatic and literary theory, among others.

He took photographs and made films, too.

Mainly experimental films

but he challenged himself in the
university's theatre company, too.

He was definitely talented.

Everything he made had a unique tone.

All of his works revolved
around life and death

and the incomprehensible between the two.

He was afraid

that he wouldn't leave
a mark in this world.

So he was writing all the time.

Or at least he always
had something in mind.

I always listened to his stories.

But when he got stuck and
suffered from writer's block

he never asked for advice.

Sometimes he was completely
exhaused at the end of the evening

leaving his notes and
thoughts open on his computer.

Sometimes I go into the room

and imagine him

sitting there

in front of the screen,
in his typical posture.

Looking at me and

smiling.

The way he smiled at me when
we first met each other.

The reason I fell in love with him.

Before moving

Jacob made up his mind that
he would send messages to mom.

More precisely he would
prepare videos for her.

About him leaving the city, the new house,
moving away, pretty much about everything.

I had no idea where all this would lead.

The case which I agreed to
take got its name quickly.

The Taylor-case.

It already had that
name when I received it.

Six of my colleagues had worked on it, but
none of them wanted to dig deeper into it.

Me neither, to tell you the truth.

But in the end the pandemic
decided instead of me.

I had to travel to England and
things started to escalate.

And I knew I need someone
to deal with this mystery.

People say that Jacob Taylor just
staged his own disappearance.

That was only the surface.

To say that this case is weird
would be an understatement.

But I knew immediately who I
should ask to deal with it.

He wanted to begin a new life and he became fed up with
carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.

The state of his mother, his
derailed life, his bankruptcy.

Was he bankrupt?

Well, on the day he disappeared
he had only $104 in his account.

According to the purchase agreement made
available to us by the real estate agent

he acquired the house at a bargain price,
but still spent almost all of his money.

You don't usually try to begin a new life
with $104 in your account, do you?

I quickly understood why no one
wanted to work on this case.

As one takes a look into the
files and gets to know the details

it gets more and more confusing
and it just doesn't make sense.

Why didn't you leave the
case to someone else?

I didn't leave it to
anyone else, because...

I couldn't leave it to anyone else, because I knew exactly
how his brother, his fiancÃ©e and all his loved ones felt.

My only unsolved case.

My wife.

What happened?

The same as with Jacob Taylor.

She disappeared four years ago.

We had a fight, she packed
her suitcase and left.

As far as I knew, she wanted to go to his
best friend's house to Indianapolis.

She never arrived.

Good morning, Jacob!

It's Mr. Brozniak, your friend, Dane!

Er, the broker's commission came
through today, thank you very much!

So, I'll send you the rest of
the invoice tomorrow and um...

You know I would have liked to give you
the keys myself, but something came up and

I asked my assistant to do it.

And if she weren't able to reach
you, she will put the key in the nook

about the door, so you can find it there.

Anyway it's no so often that I can sell

a special house

so um, yeah, by the way

there's a door and it's upstairs

and it's locked and we couldn't
find a key and open it.

And the former owner
you know, he's deceased.

And his son, who commissioned
the sale, he lives in Japan.

We tried to email him, we
tried to phone him, but

yeah, we didn't get in touch with him, so you'll have
to get a locksmith if you want to open that door.

But anyway, have a good time there.

I'm sure it's going to be unforgettable.

Yeah, bye.

Okay, so here we are.

This is the kitchen.

Sort of.

Great.

Nice.

Ah, come on!

Okay, let's see.

Strange.

It's on.

It's supposed to be on!

Oh, God, I need to find an electrician.

I brought this.

See? I'm prepared!

Okay, so to the right

the bathroom!

How charming.

Thank God I can close it.

Behind door number one.

The living room!

I thought it would be somewhat bigger.

Or cleaner.

Nevermind.

Okay, going up the upstairs.

It's great that all the
windows are boarded down.

The most important room.

Yeah, the bedroom.

And two more rooms.

Behind door number three.

Eh, the toilet.

And behind door number...

It's closed.

Well, this is it.

We'll make it cozier, you'll like it.

You'll see it soon.

I've been telling you since I was a kid
that one day I'll have a two-storey house.

Well...

Here it is.

Great.

Shit.

The door that hands can't open.

I thought it would be somewhat easier.

The hell with you then!

I can't see anything.

Why would it be locked if
there's nothing inside.

Ah, mom, I don't even want to know
how much this is going to cost.

I just need to find the key to it.

Let's find out if I can do something with the heating or
whether I'm going to need two blankets for the night.

Great!

I won't feel cold.

I'm just dying from smoke inhalation.

It's unbelievable that we are literally
just a few steps away from the forest.

If anyone should ask why I moved here.

This is exactly why.

I was fed up with the
superfluous chit-chats.

The questions.

The people.

The traffic.

The noise.

The grey breath of the city.

Not to mention that the
mornings were always the same.

It'll be so great to have lunch together.

We're cooking in the garden, but we might have
to wait a bit, until the weather gets better.

How much we'll walk when we'll be here.

This isn't exactly what you're
supposed to wear in the forest.

That's strange.

I still smell the perfume on it.

Hey JT, this is John.

Ah, yeah, you can see me.

I don't do video messages too often.

I hope you get this one.

A few days ago

Ben told me there might be no
signal where you moved, so...

Look, I know things didn't turn out like
we expected at least as far as I see it.

I know I made some serious mistakes, I wasn't there
for your mother when she needed me and I wasn't...

the best stepfather
either, I'm sorry for that.

So many times in my life I screwed up,
I hoped I wouldn't do the same with you.

I used to be selfish and didn't pay
enough attention to what you

really needed.

I ended up with a great new family, but...

I wasn't there for you.

I know you wanted to find a
place you can truly call home.

Told me once about these plans of yours.

Most of us spend our entire lives
in hiding, don't be one of them.

There are people who need you.

Look, I'm gonna visit your mother tomorrow,
I thought maybe I could pick you up and...

We could go together.

I hope we can reconnect soon.

I heard something again.

Near the front door.

Like somebody was rummaging around.

If all goes well

Ben will stop by today.

I want to take some nice
pictures in the weekend.

I'll show you when I see you next.

I just need to grab my bag.

And my camera.

What the hell?

This isn't funny.

The same scent.

Lost scarf is available for pick up!

Hey JT, I hope you get this message.

I just want to say thank you for
helping me in work these past two years.

Your kind words are always appreciated and
your words of advice were very beneficial.

Look, um...

The atmosphere at work has changed a bit.

This may sound stupid, but I miss you.

We all miss you.

Look...

I saw you left some documents on your desk.

I put them in your drawer.

That's when I found it.

JT, um...

I'm so sorry.

I wish you had told me.

I probably could've helped you.

I haven't told anyone.

And I won't.

I promise.

I mean I made sure your drawer
is locked, I have the key.

When you come in and
sign your two-week notice

we need to talk.

Please.

Take care.

I just found this on my door.

Now I know why I got the house so cheap.

Pull over five times to check
if I'm still in the same state

and I kept on looking behind to make sure some fucking yeti
wasn't about to drag me into the shrubs for a buttfuck!

I'm happy to see you too, bro!

What's going on, bro?

Test shots for the newest installment
of the Blair Witch Project?

Hi, Heather!

I'm scared!

It's quite dark, isn't it?

Yeah, I know.

You wanted to disappear and by the looks of
things, you finally accomplished it.

Yeah, but...

Great place, huh?

I prefer the hustle and the
bustle of the city you know.

Ah, I know.

Come on, take a look around!

Say hello to mom.

Seriously?
Mhm.

Hi, Mom!

One round?

I'll drive, man!

There're crazy curves here.

My car nearly skidded
off the road three times.

But you don't leave immediately, so
I guess one won't do any harm.

Okay, let's smash it then.

By the way, did you see anyone
while you were coming here?

I haven't seen a goddamn soul for hours.

No cars, no one, why?

You've made some new friends already!

This dude must have read
too much Agatha Christie.

A love letter would have been nicer.

By the way, what's up with Miss Four Eyes?

Katie!

Whatever, she's still gross.

If she took away her glasses and glued a fake mustache
on your dick, she'd totally believe it was Magnum.

You're a jerk!

Besides, the new guy
doesn't have a moustache.

How would I know, I
never watched that shit.

Anyway...

She dumped me.

So, from now on, you'll only date girls who
can actually see who they are going out with.

Let's drink to that!

Only half!

Alright, lightweight.

Let's take a walk!

I'm pretty sure you have to spend
an absurd amount of money on it.

Yeah, but at least I bought this
little palace next to nothing.

How much?

40k.

Holy fuck!

I couldn't even buy a decent
apartment for that in the city.

Yeah, that's all I had.

Twenty miles further a house like
this would've cost twice as much.

I can't even imagine
why you got it so cheap.

Well, I'll definitely need to
spend some cash to fix it up.

An on the garden, too.

There's only a shovel in the shed.

Which I can use to bash the heads of idiots
who want to send me notes.

It sucks that you've already pissed off
somebody after only a day.

What the hell did they want from you?

Well, to leave, just like the note said.

But to their loss, because
I'm not going anywhere!

Miles and miles without a soul in sight...

Well worth the money.

Like the hermit from Maine.

Christopher whatever, I
don't remember his last name.

He lived alone in the
forest for 27 years, huh?

In harsh winters and frost.

I doubt I have that much time left.

You're an idiot.

Your nose is bleeding.

What?

Your nose is starting its period, wipe it!

Ah, thanks, it happens now and then.

Whoa!

This is so hypnotic.

You and the forest behind
you and this gloomy weather.

What do you want?

I don't know.

I'm just...

trying to talk...

I mean...

I mean, the way...

we haven't talked to each
other in a long time.

Fine.

Let's do it, I don't mind.

I want to know

what this whole thing is about?

I mean...

what's going on with you, bro?

It's really hard to say you know.

I guess, I...

never wanted to bother anyone about it.

Because I'm the one who
has to face these things.

Things?

Our decisions.

Everything that makes us who we are.

Because in the end...

it's just us.

Alone.

Full of...

questions and regrets.

You see?

I think I do, yes.

I was fed up with being how to feel.

How I should feel.

They wanted me to laugh when I...

wanted to cry.

They wanted me to cry when I just couldn't.

They told me everything
would be alright, but

they were only words.

And I heard it from everyone.

Friends, colleagues, you.

Even from the girl next door who
never said hello, but somehow

she just found out what happened.

I often talk to mom, when I visit her.

But I never tell her
everything would be alright.

Never.

Because I know it won't be.

And I'm sure she knows it.

Somewhere deep inside.

Even if she's

not able to express it.

Don't say that.

But maybe this is the place
I need to write it down.

To put all I'm feeling into words.

I've never seen him so
sad and lonely before.

But I only realized that
on my way back home.

I was driving slowly and was thinking about
those few hours I spent there.

Fuck you, Ben!

What should I do with it, bro?

What the fuck?

Who's there?

I'm coming up!

Maybe I'm going mad.

Hey, Kim, little sis' here!

Again.

So I just wanted to drop you this VM to let you know that
I've got the tickets for the weekend Madness concert.

Third row.

I know.

I'm so cool.

Ah, I'm really not good at this, okay.

So that was not the reason
I was messaging you today.

I've actually had the
tickets for like a week.

But I just didn't tell you,
I wanted it to be a surprise.

And now I've just fucked it up as well.

Dammit, I um...

So you know I've got this friend, Mandy.

We call her the Nun as she totally
looks like the one in that horror movie.

Whatever.

So she works in the hospital and we
were having a chat the other day.

About Jacob.

She was saying that after a
while he was spending like

eight to ten hours there a day.

He was eating lunch and
dinner in the coffee-shop

and some days he even
slept in the waiting area.

And the strangest thing

is that he was even there when
her mother was also there.

Like just a few hours earlier.

I really hope you get
this before you set off.

And I'm not trying to tell you what
to do, I just want you to be careful.

And I'm not trying to tell you
some dumb shit either about

like how you could do so much
better or why you're still with him.

But there's something really
really strange about him like

he's secretive and he's just not
the same person we knew before.

And this whole case with his
mother is really strange.

Strange things have happened
in the past few days mom.

Maybe the strangest was last night.

There were people around the house.

Fortunately everything is calm now, but

I'm thinking about exploring
the local neighborhood

asking them about troublemakers.

"Neighborhood".

What the fuck?

Six lanterns.

Six crosses.

Nobody told me there's a
graveyard in the forest.

Fuck.

Hi Jacob, it's me.

I was about to visit you, but

um...

I thought

that I made the right decision

by leaving this whole moving thing to you.

By letting you go to that place.

And after a while you'd realize that
maybe it was better to be with me.

But I never saw any sign you
wanted to come back with me.

Both of us made mistakes.

Mine was letting you go.

You know where the keys are.

Front door, upper lock, gate, everything.

I'll see you at home.

Is anyone here?

What?

My god!

It opens.

By itself.

What the fuck?

Don't ever come to life for fuck's sake.

Alright, JT!

This is the moment your brain must
alarm you to get the hell out of here.

You know where the car key is.

You can always go to Kim or Ben.

The same scent.

Fuck!

Early signs of mental illness or
you're preparing for a garage sale?

Go fuck yourself!

How could you come in at all?

The door was open.

I came to see you and maybe to
get drunk later if it's okay.

By the way...

what's up with Kim?

She never came here.

Sorry to say so, but it's no surprise.

Don't fuck with me I'm
not in the mood for it.

Just help me look around!

Have you found anything interesting?

Look at them.

It's not by chance someone kept them.

They're looking at the same direction.

What?

The mannequin and the toys.

They're looking at the same direction.

Let's take a closer look.

It's hollow.

Okay.

What?

My bad!

Fuck you, Ben!

Yeah!

Yeah, yeah!

Go, go, go, go, go!

Look at that!

It's a book.

Wait a second.

Yesterday

I found a drawing.

It was in the attic.

Look at that.

It matches.

It's not a book, it's a box!

We need to play it with something.

It's getting more and more creepy.

Just look around, look
for a camera or a player.

Anything it fits into.

Shit, shit, shit!

What the fuck?!

I've just found it in this shit.

What?

It was in this fucking table,
a gun, I guess it's loaded!

Let me see.

I'm fed up, that's all!

Hey!

Don't you want to see what is on the tape?

I don't give a shit!

Ben!

Just show it to me.

No fucking way!

I don't want you to start shooting wearing
only your fucking underpants for fuck's sake!

Where are you going?

Where are we going?!

Because you can't stay
here, you better understand!

You bring your stuff to me.

There is a couch.

I wouldn't say it so comfy, but
you have to stop this right now!

It's not that simple, you don't know the
things I've been and am going through.

She's my mother, too!

My mother is also in that fucking hospital!

While you're acting like
a fucking complete idiot

like a fucking lunatic hermit

mom's condition's getting worse!

She's getting worse?

Yes, welcome back, bro!

I can't go back, you understand?

Here, I can talk to mom.

It's almost like she's here with me.

I know it sounds crazy and I
want to see her one day, but...

See her while you still can!

You have to let me go now Ben.

Jacob.

Just...

Go, please.

Everything will be alright, believe me.

Just go now.

And leave the gun here.

No fucking way!

I heard something again.

I'm getting sick of it.

It sounded like...

Is anybody here?

What do you want from me?

Do you want to hurt me?

Do you want me to...

To leave?

Do you live here?

I mean, did you leave here?

Okay.

Okay, okay.

Are you alone?

Fucking hell!

How many are you?

Six.

Six crosses.

Six lanterns.

What do you want from me?

Why me?

Do you want me to

help you?

How can I help you?

Do you want me to

find something?

In the room.

It's in the room, right?

The tape.

There's something on the tape.

Let's see if there's anything here.

My dear god.

The scarf.

It's yours, right?

I'm really sorry for what happened.

I am.

I'm just...

I don't think I'm the one who can help.

I'll bring the tape to the police.

I'll show it to them.

I'm sorry.

That's impossible.

Who's there?

What's happening here?

Shit!

What?

Jacob!

Stop!

What the fuck is going on?

What the fuck is going on?!

You'll be waited in the woods.

Are you alright?

For fuck's sake, are you alright?

Let me go!

Jacob!

Jacob!

Say something!

This is 911, what is your emergency?

I need help.

My brother disappeared.

His name is Jacob Taylor, please...

Please, help us.

Sir, can you tell me exactly what happened?

I shot him.

I shot a man and my brother just ran away.

And said someone was waiting
for him in the woods.

Could you tell me the
address you're calling from?

Can you hear me?

Sir, can you hear me?

I'll see you at home.

That was the last thing I told him.

He knew

we wouldn't see each other again.

After the police had searched the house

things began to make more sense,
when they found Jacob's lab results.

He only had two or three months left.

But as it turned out

he refused any kind of treatment.

I always thought he went to the hospital
so frequently because of his mother.

But everything became clear
after his brother called me.

He barely ever said anything
in the car during those trips

but as I drive along that route

I miss him every single day.

I don't sleep well since that night.

I watch the TV or read something.

Then I find myself recalling a memory.

He stood up as if nothing had happened.

He looked at me for a few seconds

and left the house.

I thought he had started to panic

and needed some fresh air

but when I...

when I went after him later

I couldn't find him anywhere.

That was the point when you
called the police, right?

Yes.

During the investigation, six
bodies were found in the graves.

The remains of four women and two infants
who disappeared between 1995 and 2006.

In each case, the murderer was Randy Black,
the former owner of the house.

During the search of the
house we found several diaries

in which Black had described
everything in detail

as if it had been some
kind of a confession.

One of the women was his wife, but she was
the only one who had come there voluntarily.

They had a daughter, but
according to Black's writings

his wife cheated on him, so he
killed her and their daughter, too.

He became obsessed with the idea of living
here in perfect harmony with his new family.

Almost every line he wrote revealed that he
felt immense guilt about the murders.

In the meantime he went bankrupt

and eventually he was
forced to leave the house.

We interviewed several people in the
surrounding area and many thought

they had seen Black in the past few years

but only a few remembered
him or knew much about him.

A few days later I received
a package from Trott.

A flashdrive with video
taken with Jacob's phone.

His phone recorded almost two minutes of
footage right after he left the house.

I wanted to believe that somebody had
intended this whole thing as a joke.

But as the other recordings were viewed,
I realised that everything we saw

were most likely true.

He was never alone.

But I can't exactly tell who
or what I saw on that footage.

In the past few days I was
rummaging through old papers

when I found one of Jacob's works.

It was about a man

who meets himself and...

and witnesses his own death.

It's kind of strange,
because he didn't complete it

but its title is very expressive.

Deep inside

I sense that Jacob wasn't led
to that place by his decisions.

It was something else.

And it wasn't by chance that

he sensed and provoked the
things we saw on the footage.

Maybe it was due to his
condition and that they

thought he could help them.

I know it sounds crazy.

I don't know if Jacob saw or
felt his own death approaching

but I don't want to

and I cannot accept the unacceptable yet.

We always strive for the better.

This is who we are as humans.

But in the end

we only left alone with the
choices we blame ourselves for.

I really want him to come home to me.

I loved my brother.

And he loved me.

He loved Kim as well.

If he was still alive

he would be here with us.

There's only one thing left
that I don't understand.

How did you know that particular
night that Jacob needed help?

I received a...

text message

telling me to help him immediately

that he needed his brother.

Who sent the message?

The message arrived at 12:26 AM

from my mother's phone.

But she was lying in come
in the hospital, wasn't she?

The doctor's report lists

time of death at 12:15 AM.

How is it possible?

Will you excuse me for a minute?

Even though we have the recordings and the investigative
materials, we can't say anything for certain

nor can we give a reasonable
explanation for all that happened.

This whole case is surreal.

That includes the disappearance of Jacob
Taylor and the death of his mother.

The events are there for everyone to see,
but we don't know what they mean.

But that doesn't make them any less real.

And they are waiting to be solved.

But first we need to clarify
a very important question.

Where is Jacob Taylor?
