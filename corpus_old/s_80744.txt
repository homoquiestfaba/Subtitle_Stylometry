<i>deathtrap from Tennessee to California ?</i>

<i>- You're sayin'I'm not ?</i>
<i>- I'm sayin'you won't</i>
<i>make it past that tree.</i>

Hey, Novalee, you plannin'
on leavin' today ?
In the bathroom, WillyJack.

Why don't she just move in
to the damn bathroom ?

<i>- Get all those pictures</i>
<i>and knickknacks.</i>
I'm ready.

<i>- I'm ready to go.</i>
Now, hold on, hold on.

Now <i>I</i> gotta go.

We'll miss you, Novalee.
You know the floor's missin'.

WillyJack got the whole car for 80
bucks. He had to fix everything on it.

And here's the best part.
No fives.

You and your fives.
What fives ?

On my fifth birthday, my mama
ran off with a baseball umpire
named Fred and never came back.

<i>After I dropped out of school</i>
<i>and was waitin'tables at Red's,</i>

one of the regulars there
named Gladys went crazy.

<i>When I tried to calm her down</i>
<i>she jumped at me with a steak knife...</i>

and cut me from my wrist
to my elbow.

And what's that
got to do with fives ?

It took 5 stitches
to close her up.

I don't like fives.

That's it. Let's hit it.
Let's go, let's go !
Hon,

will you take a picture of us
with my new camera ?

Wait !
All around, let's go.
Come on, come on !

I'm gonna miss you. Call me, okay ?
All right. Bye.

All right. Bye.

-Jesus, finally. It's already 5:00.
5:00 ?

I hope we can a place to live
that overlooks the ocean.

Hell, Novalee, you can't see
the ocean from Bakersfield.

Well-- well,
maybe a pond then.

I wanna get one of those patio tables
with an umbrella over it...

where we can sit with the baby
and drink chocolate milk
and watch the sun go down.

I've never lived anyplace
that didn't have wheels under it.

Hey. Hey !

Hey !

Hey, Novalee, wake up !
You sound like a damn pig.

Jesus. What the hell's

And where are your shoes ?

That's just great.
That's great.

My feet are swollen.
I had to take'em off.

<i>Ooh!</i>

Wanna feel the baby ?

Here.

Feel that ?
No.

He'll pick me up.

Well, have a nice day.

Well, Ruth Ann Mott.

Why, honey,just look at you !
Little Ruth Ann Mott.

Honey, I haven't seen you
since your mama passed.
What's that-- 1 0, 1 1 years ?

I'm not--
Don't you remember me ?
I'm Sister Husband.

<i>Oh,you remember me. You used to call me</i>
<i>''Telma''because you couldn't say Thelma.</i>

<i>[ Laughs ]</i>
<i>Can you say ''Thelma''?</i>

Thelma.
Good !

Oh, Lord, look at you--
havin' a baby.

So, you just move back home, Ruth Ann?
See, I'm not who--

Oh, you know what they say:
'' Home is where your history begins.

Home is where they catch you
when you fall.''

That's what the late
Brother Husband used to say.

Brother Husband--
was he your husband ?

No, he was my brother,
a real man of God.

You read the Bible, Ruthie ?
Not as much as I should.

Good.
I think that's good.

Folks read too much of it.
They just get confused.

<i>That's why I like to hand out</i>
<i>just one chapter at a time.</i>

That way, folks can deal with
their confusion as it comes.

Come on. Come on.
You're comin' with me. Come on.

I'm not gonna let you
get away empty-handed.

Now, on behalf of the Merchants
and Businessmen's Association...

of the city
of Sequoyah, Oklahoma,

I do present you with this
basket of gifts and merchandise.

Thank you.
Looky here, Ruth Ann,
you got, um, discount coupons...

and matches, a map of the city,
emery boards-- oh, oh, yeah.

Now, you see this little appointment
book? I ran out of these last week,

so I had to put two or three
of my own appointments in this one,

but if you're not an alcoholic, you'll
know those meetin's aren't for you.

No, ma'am, I'm not.
Good. I think that's good.

Oh, yeah, one more thing.

What is that ?
This is a buckeye tree.
Brings you good luck.

Here, take it.
There.

Well, good-bye, Ruth Ann.

You know it was real nice to see you
again. Hmm. And welcome home !

I'm in the phone book.
You come and see me anytime you want.

And bring that baby.

[ Engine Starts, Backfires ]

Excuse me.

Would you like a picture of your baby?
Hmm?

I'm not-- I mean, I'm still--
Oh, well, I mean, after.

Oh !
[ Chuckling ] Of course.

Wow ! What kind
of camera is that ?

This is a Rollei.

There aren't many made like this here.
It's a beauty.

My name is Moses--
Moses Whitecotton.

Novalee Nation.

Novalee Nation--
that's a good strong name.

You know,
a name's important.

Have you picked out a name
for your baby yet ?

Well, I was thinkin' about
''Wendi'' with an ''I''

Oh, don't you dare.

Give that baby a name that means
somethin', a good, sturdy name.

Here.

I'm here the first Friday of every
month, 1 2:00 to 6:00. Take care.

And remember: Give that baby a name
that means somethin', you hear ?

I will, I promise.

<i>What kind of book ?</i>

About-- about trees.

<i>Trees ?</i>

Yeah.

You know.

<i>Forestry? Environment ?</i>
<i>Agriculture ? Botany?</i>
<i>What do you want to know about trees ?</i>

<i>Well, a few weeks ago</i>
<i>somebody gave me a buckeye tree.</i>

<i>Buckeye--horse chestnut--</i>

belongs to the genus <i>Aesculus,</i>
of the family <i>Hippocastanaccae.</i>

I-I think it's dyin'-- my tree. I could
show it to the people who gave it to me,

but I'm embarrassed to let them
see how sick I let it get.

There. Look up ''buckeye'' in the index.
The what ?

I'll start slower.
These are called ''books.''

Are you still with me ? Here.
Hey.

Uh, there. See ? Read.

'' Leaf rot. Root damage.

It's good to see you again, darlin'.
You come right on in.

I want you to meet
my gentleman, Mr. Sprock.

Mr. Sprock ? Mr. Sprock.
Hmm ?

Oh, how do you do ?
Buttermilk ?

Dear Lord, we pray
that You will bless this food...

to the nourishment
of our bodies,

and we pray, Lord, for a safe delivery
and a healthy child...

for our new friend.

And we ask forgiveness, Lord, for the
fornication that Mr. Sprock and me...

have committed again
this afternoon.

Amen.

Amen.
Amen.

<i>I'll come by every day to take care</i>

Oh, good.
Now, if it's any kind
of bother, I could--

Oh, no, no, darlin'. I meant
it's good that you'll be by every day.

Why, we'd sure be glad to see you.
Oh.

Although, you know,
I have to say,

I don't know what kind
of people you're staying with
that won't let you plant a tree.

Well, they're--
And what's gonna happen
when you have your baby ?

I-- I'm not sure.

Let me help you there,
Mr. Sprock.

Hey, Rosita ! How you doin' today ?
Good !

[ Sighs ]

You know, the book in the ''libary''
said the highest spot in the yard...

is the best place to plant the tree.
Oh, you must have met Forney.

Who ?
<i>- [ Wheezing ]</i>

[ Continues Wheezing ]

You all right, Mr. Sprock ?
Oh, I'm fine. A little emphysema.

<i>- It's nothin'serious.</i>
You know, he makes that noise
whenever he exerts himself?

Who's ''Thorny'' ?
Forney.

Forney Hull-- brilliant man,
lives in the ''libary.''

Brilliant.
There's no tellin' what he might
have done in this world...

You're a big celebrity.

They're reporters here.
Lean up.

See ?

TV ! They've been here all night.
What for ?

For you !
They wanna talk to you.

Me ?
Of course.

Everybody wants to talk
to the mother of the Wal-Mart baby.

Am I in trouble ?
Are they gonna arrest me ?
What for ?

For livin' in the Wal-Mart.
Arrest you ?

Is the hospital gonna keep my baby ?
Where is she ?

<i>- Why would the hospital keep your baby?</i>
Because I can't pay.

It's like-- it's like
a restaurant-- when you can't
pay, they make you wash dishes.

I don't know what
they're gonna make me do.

No. No.
I'm broke. I got nothin'.

I have no family, no job,
and I got a baby.

I know what you need.

[ Gurgling ]
Yes, you're okay.
Look who we're going to see.

[ Gasps ]
Say, ''It's about time.''

Does that help ?
[ Gurgling ]

Oh, oh, yeah.

How can you love someone
so much you just met ?

Forney's okay too. Doctor stitched
him up and sent him on home.

Forney ? The ''libary'' guy ?
Mm-hmm.

Yeah.
Why ? What happened to him ?

He jumped through a plate-glass window
to deliver your baby.

Don't you remember ?
That was <i>him</i> ?

[ Fussing ]
Oh.

So, what are you
gonna name her ?

Oh, that's right.

<i>[ Lexie ] ''Americus''? How the hell'd</i>
<i>you come up with a name like Americus ?</i>

<i>[ Novalee ] I wanted her</i>
<i>to have a strong name,</i>

Ooh. Aw.
[ Baby Crying ]

Well, I guess I should talk.
I call my kids after snack foods:

Brownie, Praline,
Cherry and Baby Ruth.

You got four ?
You don't look old enough.
Yep.

Well, I started when I was 1 5,
and I just couldn't stop.

I wanted to find the first one
a daddy, but all I got
out of that was another baby.

So, I wanted to find 'em both
a daddy, and so on, and so on.

I think I'm goin' about this
the wrong way.
[ Chuckles ]

Hey ! There she is !
That's the Wal-Mart mommy !

Now, how long were you
living in the Wal-Mart ?

Uh, uh,

six weeks.
And what was it like ?

You know.

[ Giggles ]

<i>Have you spoken</i>
<i>to the father?</i>

Novalee, if I was you,
I'd rule out a career in broadcastin'.

Why would anyone
write anything so hurtful ?
What's it say ?

''A baby born out of holy wedlock
is an abomination in the eyes of God.''

[ Sighs ]
My baby is not an abomination.

Screw 'em.
Midnight, Mississippi.

Oh, my.
This one's sad.

''I gave birth to a baby in a V.W. van
where I lived for nearly a year.''

[ Sighs ] '' My baby didn't make it.
I hope yours does.

I don't have much else to offer you,
but I know that some money might help,

so I enclose $1 0.''

Can you believe that ?

'' Duda,'' Texas.
[ Chuckles ]

''I wish I could send you some
money, but I don't have any.

What I can offer you is
a good home.''

Send her the $1 0.

Lexie, one of your kids is
on the phone.

Which one ?

I don't know.
Pez, Twinkie-- one of'em.

[ Scoffs ] I'll be right back.
[ Giggles ]

<i>- [ Woman ] Is Novalee in there ?</i>
<i>- [ Lexie ] Yes, ma'am.</i>

Well,

I hope you don't think
this kid's gonna call me ''Grandma.''

I'm sorry, ma'am, but visiting hours
are not until-- [ Gasps ]

Are when ?
Right now.

Yes. Thank you.

Mama ?
I thought you'd be surprised.

How'd you know I was here ?
There ya are.

I saw your fabulous interview

and I hopped right in the car,

Oh, I must have been in that damn car,

From where ?

New Orleans.

I been livin' there
about, um--

about two, three years now.

With Fred ?
Who ?

Fred, the umpire.

[ Scoffs ]

That shithead ?
Oh, my God !

<i>[ Laughing ]</i>
<i>Jesus!</i>

What in God's name
made you think of him ?

Because he was
the reason you left.

Left what ?
Me.

Oh, geez. Now,

sweetie, look.

[ Scoffs ] That is all
water under the bridge.

I didn't drive here for ten hours
to reminisce with you, all right ?

Well, then why did you come ?
Well, I thought
you could use some help.

You didn't look too good
up there. You--

Livin' in the Wal-Mart is
not my idea of a big success.

How are <i>you</i> gonna help ?
I don't know.

You got a man ?
No.

It's not one of those
artificial ''spermination'' things is it ?

No.

Then where <i>is</i> the prick
who put you in this mess ?

California.

[ Laughs ]
Well, that figures.

All the pricks--
they move to California.

They ought to call it
'' Prick-ifornia.''

Got a place to live ?

Sweetie, look. You are going to need
a place to take this baby.

Maybe you should think about movin'
into Sears. I hear Kmart is really nice.

Did you come all this way
just to make fun of me ?

God, no.

Jesus.

<i>- [ Stamping Out Ash ]</i>
I didn't. I wanted...

[ Laughing Nervously ]
to help my child with her child, is all.

You want me to go ?
No.

All right then.
[ Chuckles ]

When are they lettin' you out ?
Tomorrow.

Hmm.

Well, I'm not
in any hurry to move on.

Maybe I could find a place--
you and me and the baby.

You mean like--
like a home ?

Uh--

home, apartment, whatever--
till you get on your feet.

I got me a little money.
[ Chuckles ]

Oh, I got money.
The president of Wal-Mart sent me $500.

Why ?

He's not the father of the child,
is he ?
No.

Aw, shit.
No, he just wanted to be nice.

They offered me any job
in any Wal-Mart in the country.

<i>Wow.</i>
<i>[ Chuckles ]</i>

So.

<i>I'm thinkin</i>:

what with your money
and my money together,

we might be able to find us
a real decent place,

<i>so I don't want you</i>
<i>to worry about anything anymore,</i>

'cause Mama Lil is here now.

Why don't you come by and pick us up
tomorrow-- me and Americus-- 9:00 a.m. ?

On the dot.
[ Chuckles ]

So, I got me a lot of stuff to do.
We gotta get diapers and blankets...

and a cradle.

Mama ?
Yeah ?

Thank you for comin'.

You bet.

<i>[ Baby Fussing ]</i>

It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

You're okay.

<i>Maybe you should try to call</i>
<i>whoever's pickin'you up.</i>

I don't know
where she's stayin'.

I could call a cab for you.
Where you goin' ?

[ Baby Crying ]

Five hundred dollars--
I should have known.

[ Horn Honking ]

Hey.

[ Sighs ]

Well, look at all this.

[ Chuckles ]
And look at <i>you.</i>

Oh, yes, you're just as cute
today as you were yesterday,

maybe cuter.
Yeah.

Well, you know that tree--

your tree that you planted
in my yard ?

I've been tryin' to take care of it,
and I just don't have the feel for it.

I don't have the time either.

So, I thought maybe if you and the baby
came to stay with me for a while...

<i>that you could</i>
<i>take care of it for me.</i>

Sure help me out a lot.

Okay.

<i>- [ Woman ] Forney!</i>
What ?

Hi.

Can I come in ?

Uh, yeah.

<i>- I need a towel!</i>
They're in the bathroom !

Is this a bad time ?
Uh, yeah. No. [ Chuckles Nervously ]

I just-- I just wanted
to thank you for--

<i>- I can't reach them !</i>
Give me two minutes !

I'll be right there.

Sorry, I--
That's okay, I--

I just wanted to thank you for--
Well, I guess you saved our lives--

me and Americus.
''Americus'' ?

You wanna hold her ?

Oh--
It's okay.

Oh, oh, oh.
[ Gasps ]

Moses Whitecotton gave me
this as a baby gift.

Uh-huh.
Oh.

Hat.

think of that ?

[ Chuckles ]
Breakfast ?

No. Before work I'm gonna take your

I'm payin'. Don't argue.

Sister, there's people at the door.
Oh, here. Come on.

Come on. There ya go.
Hello.

There ya go. Who's a good girl ?
Yes.

I got her.

Yes ?
Ma'am,

we have come here today to bring
the Word of God to the Wal-Mart baby...

and to her young,
unmarried mama.

We drove all the way up
from Midnight, Mississippi.

Well, you folks could have
saved yourself a trip,

'cause the Word of God's been
in this house a long time.

[ Sighs ] I thought that was
all over and done with--

people wantin' to see
the Wal-Mart baby.

Bye, sweetie. Mama will be back.
[ Gurgles ]

Bye, Mr. Sprock.
I made links !

Thank you.

[ Sighs ]
Dear Lord, we pray...

that you will bless this food
for the nourishment of our bodies,

and we ask forgiveness, Lord, for the
fornication that Mr. Sprock and me...

committed this morning
on this very table.

Amen.
Amen.

<i>[ Radio ]</i> <i>Only you</i> 

<i>Can make this world</i>

Yeah, the good-lookin' mechanic.
Honey--
Yeah.

I don't know what's wrong with me.
I didn't even want to be with him.

Well, didn't he use anything ?
-Just me.

<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do.</i>

Well, this old Gypsy woman once told me
that if you jump backwards nine times...

before the sun come up,
you won't be pregnant.

So I jumped so far I had to take a bus
to get back home, and then I had twins.

[ Chuckles ]
Which is why the guy
I'm seein' now is pretty perfect.

Why's that ?
Well,

he's sterile
as a cotton ball.

So it's permanent ?
Oh, yeah.
He had mumps when he was 1 5...

and they went down on him.
Down where ?

To his manly areas.

So they're--
Oh, God, Novalee, no.

He's just shootin' blanks,
is all.

Well, let's face it: Girls like us
don't get the pick of the litter.

I don't think you're pregnant,
but you'll have to wait it out.

I'll see ya. Bye-bye.
Bye.

Bye.
You ready to go home ?

<i>[ Grunting ]</i>

Are you finding what you want ?

I don't know what
they're talkin' about.

I have to look up every other word
in the dictionary,

then I have to look up those words
in the children's dictionary.

Takes me a half-hour
to read a page.

Well, maybe this is something
that's hard to learn from books.

I mean, it's photography.
Hard for <i>me</i> anyway.

Uh--
Is something wrong ?

Is there a ladies' room ?
Yeah.

<i>[ Novalee Shouting ] Yes!</i>
<i>Thank you, Lord! Thank you so much.</i>

Things went well ?
You bet.

Oh, I-I gotta go.

Oh, you've got a big date
or something ?
No.

Oh, because I thought you were
sort of seeing somebody, or--

No, that's done. That's finished.
I am done with guys like that.

Like what ?
You know-- good-lookin', cocky,

look great in tight jeans
and a white t-shirt.

Those guys are
all wrong for me, Forney.

I don't want that anymore.
I want a change.

No more men at all.
Oh.

<i>[ Crashing ]</i>

<i>Forney, help me.</i>

[ Sighs ]
All right. Here.

Okay.

Who's that ?

Novalee, I'd like you
to meet my sister.

This is
Mary Elizabeth Hull.

She's the librarian.

<i>Mary Elizabeth's</i>
<i>a lot older than I am.</i>

I was still just a kid
when she started drinking.

Oh, you're underselling that.
[ Chuckles ]

I was about ten, I guess,
the first time my father put her away.

Away ? Where ?
In a sanitorium back east.

So, what exactly
are you looking for ?

Well, I'm lookin' for a gift
for Sister and Mr. Sprock.

It's their anniversary.
Anniversary ?

Yeah, they've been...
close for six years.

So anyway, I was back east
at college, and--

College ?
Yeah, I was studying
to be a history teacher,

but my dad died and my sister
couldn't be left alone here.

She begged me
never to send her away again.
Told me she'd kill herself if I did.

That was nine years ago.

So what are you thinking ?
Candlestick holders ?

Picture frame ?

Good God. Who would buy
somebody else's toupee ?

[ Laughs ]
Oh, my gosh. Look at this.

[ Blows ]

It just needs
a little cleanin' is all.

Hey, Moses, you want
to hear somethin' funny ?

I wouldn't mind.

Well, I was thinkin' that...

someday-- I mean, I mean
a long time from now--

I could, you know,
maybe be a photographer.

That's not funny.

It's not ?
You don't hear me laughin'.

I never had
a Christmas tree before.

Not a live one.

You have one of those
aluminum ones ?

No.

Those cost money.

No, when I was eight,

I was livin' with this--
this old lady.

<i>She promised me</i>
<i>we'd have a Christmas tree.</i>

And then she went
and spent all her money...

on a set of bagpipes...

because, well, I guess
she was just insane, but--

[ Chuckles ]
She, she felt bad.

So, on Christmas morning,
she found some green paint,

and she painted
a Christmas tree...

on her living room wall,
floor to ceilin'.

<i>And that was my only tree</i>
<i>till now.</i>

<i>- Hey.</i>
Hey, Lexie.

Hi.
Hi.

Hey, Lex. Hi, kids.
<i>- [ Lexie ] Hi.</i>

Hi.
Everybody say ''hi.''

How do you feel ?
Ha ! Mumps ?

I got his mumps right here.

All right, babies. Go find us
a good-lookin' Christmas tree.

One that doesn't cost
more than $40.

-So have you heard from him ?
-Oh, you mean, since he stole...

my brand new Dutch oven,
king-size pillows and rode
out of town on his Harley ?

I guess that's what I meant.

You want us to wait around,
give you a ride ?

Nah. You never know.

Maybe I can get knocked up again
on the way home.

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

Why would a man on a Harley
steal a woman's pillows ?

Just because he could,
I guess.

You know, I cannot wait
till Americus sees this tree.

Well, don't expect too much
of a reaction.

After all,
Americus is only--

Hey, you know what ?
What ?

Americus is exactly
five months old today.

What ?
Yeah, she was born July 5.

<i>[ Tires Screeching ]</i>

<i>- [ Sister ] Novalee!</i>
What happened ?

<i>I'm sorry. I no more than</i>
<i>turned around and she was gone.</i>

What happened ?
She's gone. Americus is gone.

You say the front door
was unlocked.

I went to the shed for more Christmas
decorations. I wasn't gone two minutes.

Was anything else missing ?
Money,jewelry ?

Is there anyone you can think of? Anyone
mad at you, has a score to settle?

There's a woman at work
doesn't like me much.

She says I park in her space even though
we don't have regular spaces,

but I don't think
she'd take Americus.

What about you, Sister ?

Anyone have a grudge against you ?
Like who ?

Someone at the A.A. Anyone there
might wanna hurt you for some reason ?

Harry, we're alcoholics.

We're generally satisfied
just to hurt ourselves.

Yeah.

Anyone could have her,
and I don't know if she's scared
or if she's sick or if she's hurt.

I don't know
if she's hungry or cold.

I know, honey. I know.
I don't even--

Excuse me. Is this always
in the baby's crib ?

No, that's not my Bible.

Oh, Lord.

Lord, I know who took her.
I know who took Americus.

What ?

Yesterday,

this woman came to the door.

<i>She was here once before.</i>
<i>She had a man with her,</i>

and they said that they wanted
to give you the Word of God.

I smart-mouthed 'em,

and they had Bibles with 'em,

like that one.

They came from Mississippi--

<i>Midnight, Mississippi.</i>

They said my baby
was an abomination ?

Am I bein' punished, Forney ?

For what ?

Things I did.

I wasn't married
when I had my baby.

Do you really think
this is what you deserve ?

<i>Let me tell you about</i>
<i>what you deserve, Novalee.</i>

If it were up to me--

<i>- [ Truck Doors Close ]</i>
<i>- [ Engine Starts ]</i>

<i>[ Dispatcher, Indistinct ]</i>

Sorry, folks. We got a classical
crime scene across the street.

Oh, my God !
You can't--
Let her go !

Hey, hey, hey !
Get down !

Hey !

A highway patrol had spotted
a Mississippi plate and stopped 'em.

They admitted they took her and
said we'd find her right here.

[ Continues Crying ]

Jesus Christ. Another guitar player.
What's your name ?

WillyJack Pickens.

You didn't even
have to make that up did you ?

What ?

Well, you just carry that guitar
around to keep your balance ?

You want me to play ?

What the fuck do you think
I want you to do, call bingo ?

One, two. You're best shot.

All right.
Well, I wrote this one myself.

I have goose bumps already.
-Jesus Christ.
