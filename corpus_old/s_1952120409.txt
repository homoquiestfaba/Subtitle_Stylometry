"Dearest Meg,
I'm having a glorious time.

I like them all.

They are the happiest,
jolliest family you can imagine.

The fun of it is,
they think me a noodle.

And say so.
At least Mr. Wilcox does.

Oh, Meg, shall we ever learn
to talk less.

But dearest Meg...

I don't know what to say
or what you will say.

Paul Wilcox and I are in love.

We are engaged."

Well, you Schlegel girls!
Tibby, look.

Margaret, if I may interfere.

What is going on?

I can tell you nothing, aunt Juley.
I know no more than you do.

We only met the Wilcoxes last spring
while we were hiking in Germany.

Oh, dear.

Someone must go down to Howards House
to make inquiries.

Howards End.
Inquiries are necessary.

What do we know about these Wilcoxes?
Are they our sort? Likely people?

But aunt Juley, what does it matter?

Helen's in love.
That's all I need to know.

Please get me a train timetable, dear.

Good morning.
Good morning.

Paul?

I'm afraid Crane
has reported sick again.

He was to take me to the Worrington's
today for tennis. I told them.

He's standing, of course.

Get rid of him, father,
hire a new chauffeur.

Mother, we're off. Good-bye.

Charlie, wait.

What?
Is papa there?

Wait a minute.
I've got some cherries.

About last night.
Nothing happened.

I'm afraid I lost my head.
Yes, we both did.

Must've been the moonlight,
except there was no moon.

Well, that's quite all right.

Do you mind?
No.

I have no money of my own...

and I have to make my way
in Nigeria.

It's beastly there for a white woman,
with the climate, natives and all that.

I think you're a ripping girl.
It's quite all right.

No one knows about it.

Meg! I wrote to my sister.
You didn't!

Yes, I'm sorry.
She's sure to come down. We must stop her.

We'll send a telegram.
Crane's off sick.

Isn't there a bicycle?
Yes, there is somewhere.

That'll be one and threepence 70,
sir.

M.J. Schlegel.
6 Wickham Place.

London, West.

"Dear Meg. All over.

Wish I'd never written.
Tell no one. Helen."

Excuse me. I'm looking for somewhere
called Howards House.

Mr. Wilcox, this lady
wants Howards End.

Forgive my asking. Are you
the younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder?

The younger.

The station's unorganized. If I had
my way, the whole lot would be sacked.

Thank you, Bernard.
Thank you, sir.

I should introduce myself.
I am miss Schlegel's aunt.

Rather. Yes, miss Schlegel's
stopping with us.

Do you want to see her?
That would be very nice.

I could run you up in the motor.

All the Schlegels are exceptional.

They are British to the backbone...

but their father was German...

and that is why they care for
literature and art.

Just one minute.

Wilcox, Howards End!

Know that I come
in no spirit of interference.

I'm here to represent the family...

and to talk to you about Helen, mr Wilcox,

my niece, and you.

Miss Schlegel and myself?

I trust there's no misunderstanding.

It's true I'm engaged to be married...

but to another young lady,
not to miss Schlegel.

Helen wrote to us.
She has told us everything.

Good god!
It's some foolery of Paul's!

But you are Paul.
No, I'm not.

Why did you say so?
I said nothing of the sort.

You did.
I did not. My name is Charles.

You mean to tell me that Paul
and your niece have... the idiot!

Damn fool!

Look, I warn you.

It's useless.
Paul hasn't a penny.

No need to warn us.
The warning is all the other way.

He hasn't told us, but your niece
lost no time in publishing the news.

If I were a man, for that last remark
I'd box your ears.

You're not fit to sit in the same room
as my niece.

She spread the news, he hasn't.
Or to clean her boots.

Might I finish my sentence?
No! I won't argue with such a person.

Let me out of this car this instant.

Don't stand up.
Sit down! Sit down!

Just sit down!
Goodness sakes!

It will, I think,
be generally admitted...

that Beethoven's fifth symphony...

is the most sublime noise...

ever to have penetrated
the ear of man.

But what does it mean?

You can hardly fail to recognize
in this music...

a mighty drama.

The struggle of a hero
beset by perils...

riding to magnificent victory
and ultimate triumph...

as described in the development section
of the first movement.

I want to draw your attention now
to the third movement.

We no longer hear the hero,
but a goblin.

Thank you, mother.

Single, solitary goblin...

walking across the universe...

from beginning to end.

Why a goblin?

I beg your pardon?
Why a goblin?

It's obvious.

The goblin signifies
the spirit of negation.

But why specifically a goblin?

Panic and emptiness.
That is what...

a goblin signifies.

Miss!

Excuse me, miss,
but my umbrella.

Miss!

Miss?

Mrs. Wilcox never got
her wedding dress wet.

Hurry up, Charles.

In you go.

Good-bye. See you there.

Astonishing bad luck...

that in the whole of London
they could find no flat to rent...

except the one bottled right up
against our library window.

Who could find no flat?

Tibby, the Wilcoxes.

Surely you remember that business
last summer...

with Helen and Paul Wilcox.

Paul Wilcox?

The one I was expected to thrash
within an inch of his life?

Oh, miss!

What is it?
Is Tibby ill?

Tibby's making tea.

Well, there's nothing worse than that.

Now, Helen...

something odd has happened.

Promise me you won't mind.

It's the Wilcoxes.

They've taken the flat opposite
for the wedding of their son.

The other son.

You do mind.

Will Paul Wilcox point and say "There
lives the girl who tried to catch me"?

Ridiculous.

They've only taken the flat
for a few weeks, the porter said.

Do we bow or cut them dead?

Darling, why don't you take up
cousin Frieda's invitation...

and go to Hamburg
for those few weeks?

Yes, I think I shall.

Not that it matters, but...

one wouldn't want
to keep bumping into Wilcoxes.

Don't hog all those scones, Tibby.

Is that young man for us,
do you suppose?

He is for us.

If you'll pardon me, miss.
You took my umbrella.

Inadvertently, I'm sure.

At the ethical hall.
"Music and meaning."

I'm so sorry.

I do nothing but steal umbrellas.
Come in and choose one.

Let's see.
Is yours a hooky or a knobbly?

I think mine's a knobbly.

That's Tibby's. How about this one?
You shouldn't open these indoors.

It's gone along the seams.

This is an appalling umbrella.
It must be mine.

I'm sorry.

Has my sister stolen your umbrella?

Not again, Helen. She is
an incorrigible thief. I am so sorry.

Do stay for tea, Mr...

Bast.
Won't you stay for tea?

Do stay for tea.

It's the least we can do,
having made you all wet.

Our brother's upstairs
to chaperone.

He's soaked, Meg. Please come up.
Bring him upstairs.

What did you think of the lecture?
I don't agree about goblins.

But I do about the heroes
and shipwreck.

I'd always imagined a trail of elephants
dancing at that point.

He obviously didn't.
"Music and meaning", Margaret.

Does music have meaning,
of the literary kind, I mean?

That's pure slush.
We've a guest.

Mr. Bast, take off your coat.
Trust us with your umbrella.

Sit down.
Have some tea.

How boring it would be
if it were only the score.

China tea? Only the score?
What an insidious omen.

We have other tea if you prefer.

Thank you.

Here's some scones
that Tibby hasn't yet consumed.

We're sorry to have inconvenienced you.
I hope you will come another day.

Would you?

We should be so glad.
Do take our card.

Thank you.

If you'll excuse me,
i must be going.

I'll see you out. Are you sure
you don't want a spot for the journey?

No, thank you.
I must be going. Good-bye.

Why didn't you make
that young man welcome, Tibby?

You must do the host a little,
you know.

You could've coaxed him into stopping...

instead of letting him be swamped
by screaming women.

Get your hot soup here!

Hot soup! Lovely and warm.

That you, Len?

Where have you been?

I'm off my head with worrying.
About what?

About you.
Let go, Jacky.

Every time I'm five minutes late,
you see me lying dead in the road...

crushed and killed
in a gruesome accident.

People do get killed in accidents
and don't come home no more.

Anymore, Jacky.

I told you I was going to a lecture
on "Music and meaning".

I lost my umbrella.

It's all right.
I got it back.

Have you had your tea?

I've cut you a bit
of tongue and jelly.

Sure?

I'll have it, then.

Funny, isn't it?

Every time I worry,
i get starving hungry.

Thoughts that go through my head!

You'd laugh.

You listening, Len?

Not only accidents...

but you'll get wet in the rain.

Did you?
No.

You said you lost your umbrella.

I thought, "Lord, he'll catch cold.
It'll go to his chest.

Where's the money to come from
for the doctor?

And what if he is in an accident...

and they take him to the hospital
in the ambulance?

And him with holes in his socks."
Hey, Jacky!

I want to see.
What?

If there's holes in your socks.
Stop it, Jacky!

Len...

come to bed.

I'll finish this chapter.

You love your Jacky?
Let me read.

Len, are you going to make it all right?

You're not starting on that again.

I've told you a hundred times,
we'll get married the day I'm 21.

I'd do it before if my brother
wouldn't come and put a stop to it.

What's it to him?
What's he ever done for me?

That's right.
What's anyone ever done?

It's just you and me.

If you was to leave me,
I don't know what i'd do.

I truly don't.

Now go to bed.

You come, too.

Come on.

Bookmarker.

"Margaret Schlegel."

And who is Margaret Schlegel?

A lady I met.

A lady. La-di-da.

Come off it.
She's 100 years old.

Says you.
So that's where you had your tea.

Nice cucumber sandwiches
cut ever so thin.

"Ankle deep, he waded
through the bluebells.

His spirit rose and exalted...

as he breathed in
the sun-drenched air.

The glorious day
was in its last decline.

Long shadows lay on the sward...

and from above the leaves dripped their
shimmering drops of gold-green light.

Moths and butterflies
swarmed in merry hosts...

flittering here,
glimmering there.

But, hush!
Could that be a deer?"

Oh, please, show her in.

So sorry.

Why, miss Schlegel.

How kind of you to call.

I wanted to for ever so long.

But we haven't been here
for ever so long.

Mrs. Wilcox...

May I?

All that business last summer
at Howards End...

No, it goes further than that.

Since we met at Speyer.
Do you remember?

That restored cathedral
that we all hated so.

What I remember principally
about Speyer...

was the great pleasure
of meeting you, miss Schlegel.

Helen's gone to Germany.

And Paul's gone to Nigeria.

Now we can meet
because they can't.

It's no use beating about the bush.
What happened in the summer...

was unfortunate for both of them,
don't you feel?

I'm sure you think the same way.
Because they should not meet.

Yes, I feel that.

They belong to types that can fall
in love but can't live together.

I'm afraid that in 9 cases out of 10...

nature pulls one way
and human nature the other.

I do rattle on.
I shall tire you out in no time.

It is true, I am not
particularly well just today.

But I'm so grateful for your visit, miss Schlegel.

You see, I'm quite alone.

My husband and daughter have gone off
on a motoring tour in Yorkshire.

And the young couple are on
their honeymoon. Charles and Dolly.

May I see? How lovely.

They've gone to Naples.

I can hardly imagine Charles in Naples.
Doesn't he like traveling?

Yes, he likes travel.

But he does see through foreigners.

What he would enjoy most
is a motor tour through England.

Charles takes after me, miss Schlegel.

He truly loves England.

Not, of course, London.
None of us love London.

It's so...

it makes one feel so unstable,
impermanent...

with the houses being torn down
on all sides.

Including,
in the foreseeable future, ours.

Are you having to leave Wickham Place?
Yes.

In 18 months when the lease expires.

Have you been there long?
All our lives. We were born there.

That is monstrous!

I do pity you from
the bottom of my heart.

I had no idea this thing
was hanging over you.

How dreadful!

You poor, poor girls.

Of course, we are fond of the house...

but it is an ordinary London house.

We shall easily find another.

No, not in this world.

Not the house that you were born in.

You'll never find that again.
Poor, poor girls.

Howards End was almost pulled down once.

It would've killed me.

It's my house, you know. It was left to me
by my brother who died out in India.

I love it so.

I even resisted when Henry,
my husband...

wanted to make changes
to improve the property.

He knew best of course.

We even have a garage...

to the west of the house...

just beyond the chestnut tree...

in the paddock...

where the pony used to be.

Where's the pony gone?

The pony? Dead, ever so long ago.

The vice of the pan-german mind is that
it only cares for what it can use.

That is the vice of the imperial mind.
The vice of the vulgar mind.

But... and this is a tremendous "but"...
they take poetry seriously.

They take poetry seriously.
Is anything gained by that?

Yes! The Germans
are always striving for beauty.

Mrs. Wilcox, my father
was a German of the old school.

A philosopher, an idealist.

The countryman of Hegel and Kant.

Isn't that your father's sword
upstairs in the drawing room?

Yes. He was a soldier, too,
when he had to be.

He was so uncomfortable
about being on the winning side...

he just hung up his sword
and never used it again.

My idea has always been...

if we could bring the mothers...

of the various nations together...

then there would be no more war.

Indeed, yes.
Absolutely.

If the mothers went to war,
there'd be no one left to defend.

Have another cutlet.
Thank you.

You are fortunate
in your cook.

We have found it difficult to get
reliable servants in london.

Servants have become
as unreliable as we are.

And we can hardly expect them to listen
to radical discussions at the table.

Annie does very well, don't you Annie?
You're very patient with us.

We never discuss at Howards End...

except, perhaps, sport.

But you should.
Discussion keeps a house alive.

You will laugh
at my old-fashioned ideas.

I will not.

I sometimes think...

it would be wiser to leave action
and discussion to men.

Then where would we be
with the suffrage?

I am only too thankful
not to have the vote myself.

Shall we go up for coffee?

Will you lead the way?
Thank you.

What interesting lives you all lead.

No, we don't.

It's no use you pretending
you enjoyed lunch. You loathed it.

But I hope you will forgive me...

by coming again alone,
or by asking me to you.

I enjoyed my lunch very much.

Truly I did. I only wish
I could've joined in more.

You're so clever, and yet so good.

It's kind of you,
but I'm neither, I'm afraid.

You've been very good to me.
You've kept me from brooding.

I'm too apt to brood.

About what?

I really don't know.

I think about my house a great deal.

You've never seen Howards End.
I want to show it to you.

Now, this is the scientific approach
to christmas shopping: A list.

A list? What a good idea.

Why don't you put your own name
at the top of the list?

Hooray!

How very kind of you
to start with me. Schlegel.

Now next. Shall I put Mr. Wilcox?

I know, these.

What do you think of that?

Oh, yes. Thank you very much.

Good, I'm glad.
You are wonderfully efficient.

Wrap that with a nice paper.
Certainly.

But your name still remains
at the top of the list.

Yes. So, Dolly.

I would like to give you something
worth your friendship.

Couldn't you get it renewed?

I beg your pardon?
The lease on your house.

Have you been thinking of that?
How kind of you.

Surely something could be done.
No, values have risen enormously.

They mean to pull down Wickham Place
and build flats like yours.

But they're horrible.
Landlords are horrible.

And so are the flats they build.

I fail to understand how people...

can actually choose to live in them.

There we are.

There we are. Thank you.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Thank you.

I sorry. We shouldn't
have done this today.

No, no.
We had to do it before.

Before?

Before my operation.

I still haven't told my family yet.
Everyone hates illnesses.

That's as it should be.

There's a chestnut tree
at Howards End...

that has pig's teeth
stuck into the trunk...

about four feet from the ground.

Yes, the teeth of a pig.

The country people put them there
long ago...

and they think that if they chew
a piece of the bark...

it will cure the toothache.

I love folklore...

and the old superstitions.

Isn't it curious, though,
that unlike Greece...

England has no true mythology?

All we have
are witches and fairies.

Will you come with me to Howards End?

I would so much like to.
Come with me now.

Now? It's too late...
there's a train at 5:00 if we hurry.

I want you to see it.
And I want to see it.

It sounds such a glorious place,
so redolent.

Yes. I lived there long before
i was married.

I was born there.

Might I come some other day?

Yes.

Some other day.

Well, a thousand thanks, miss Schlegel,
for your help.

It is a comfort to have the presents
off my mind.

The christmas cards especially.

I do admire your choice.

Mrs. Wilcox.

I will come, if I still may.
Return to Hilton, please.

You must stop the night, my dear.

It's in the morning
my house looks most beautiful.

Two returns, please.

Thank you.

This is yours?

I can't show you my meadow properly
except in sunlight.

It was so romantic.
It was in Italy.

Yes, and the two trains stopped
on either side.

I opened the window and this man
handed a rose across.

I don't know where he got it.

Was he Italian?
Yes, I think so. Italian.

He'd have to be Italian,
wouldn't he?

Mother!
Evie!

You never wrote. Look who I found.
What are you doing here?

We crashed the car. Are you going
to Howards End? Why? How are you?

It's such a lovely surprise
I'm fit as a fiddle.

Do you remember miss Schlegel?
Yes. How are you?

We crashed the car in Yorkshire.

We must go home. You can't go
to Howards End. It's 10 to 5:00.

Miss Schlegel, I'm afraid our outing
will have to be another day.

Before I forget.
There's a German expression with that.

Yes. Not canceled but postponed.
Come home with us.

No, no. Please. Good-bye.

Till later.

How lovely to see you.

I've been thinking of you.

And of our meadow.

Here.

The day you are strong enough...

i shall hold you to your promise.

Oh, miss Schlegel.

So, to repeat.
We have here...

forwarded by the matron
of that nursing home...

sealed and addressed to me...

a note purporting
to be in your mother's handwriting.

And it says...

"I would like miss Schlegel,
Margaret...

to have Howards End."

Mother never wrote that.

No date.

No signature.

Of course.
It's a forgery.

Not now, please, later. Thank you.

The house was of course your mother's
to leave to whom she wished.

Let me see it.

Why, it's only in pencil.
Pencil never counts.

Yes, we know it is not legally binding,
Dolly. We are aware of that.

Of course, my dear, we consider you
as one of the family.

But it is better if you don't interfere
with what you don't understand.

The question is...

whether, during the time miss Schlegel
managed to befriend my mother...

I don't think this is a case
of undue influence.

To my mind the question is...

the invalid's condition
when the note was written.

My dear father,
consult an expert if you wish...

but I don't admit
it is my mother's handwriting.

You just said it was.

Never mind if I did.

So we're all agreed then that I would be
legally justified in tearing this up.

And all else aside...

how is this gift to be conveyed
to miss Schlegel?

Is she to have a life interest in it
or is she to own it absolutely?

She may be on her way down
this very minute to turn us all out.

I don't believe miss Schlegel
knows anything about this...

this whim of your mother's.

Mother believed so in ancestors.

She would never have left anything
to an outsider.

If miss Schlegel had been poor,
if she'd wanted a house...

but she has a house.
Why should she want another?

She wouldn't have wanted us
to even see this thing.

Your poor mother
would not have wanted it.

Len, you coming in?

In a minute.

Right.

What are you looking at?

See that big one up there?
That's Ursa Major.

Great bear.

You follow those two down
about four times...

and that one there is the Pole star,
I'm fairly certain.

They're just stars.

Jacky, stop it.
It's important.

You'll catch your death.

Excuse me, sir.
The policy.

Yes, yes.
That's all signed.

Would you read that?

Yes, of course.

"The trees reared
in mighty columns...

their tops still radiant
in sunlight...

which, spilling down,
went through the wealth of leaves...

dissolved at last
in the darkness of the mossy earth.

Their color slowly faded
from out of the flowers.

But their scent lingered
to honey the air he breathed."

There's a woman to see you, ma'am.

A woman and not a lady, Annie?

She won't give her name.
Ask her to come up.

She says she won't come up.

Then we shall have to go down.

Good afternoon.

I'm looking for my husband.
Here?

Thank you, Annie.

I have my reasons
to believe that he is here.

You're welcome to search for him.
I'm so sorry.

Your husband's name.
Leonard Bast, as I'm sure you're aware of.

Margaret, are we concealing
a Mr. Leonard Bast?

There appears to have been some mistake, mrs Bast.

I do not think we are acquainted
with your husband.

No, there's no mistake.

I know for a fact he has visited
in this house.

He had his tea here.
That is a grave allegation.

Yes, to have corrupted a married man
with giving him tea.

I wish we could help you, mrs Bast.

It seems you can't...

or won't...

except to have a laugh
at my expense.

So I'm very sorry to have troubled you,
and wish you a good afternoon.

Do what you can for the house.
The drawing room reeks of smoke.

With Rita smoking, too,
the house might be more mousier.

I doubt it.

This is lovely.

There's a Mr. Leonard Bast.

It must be him.
The one you corrupted with tea.

I'll do the host.
Thank you.

Mr. Bast, come this way.

Do come in, Mr. Bast. Good evening.

Do come in and have pudding with us.
Or would you prefer some dinner?

I've had my tea, thank you.
Have a chair.

Glass of wine? Port?

No, thank you.

Do take a seat, and let us know
how we can help you.

You wouldn't remember giving me this?

Not at the time.
That was how it happened, you see.

How what happened?
Where did we meet, Mr. Bast?

I don't remember.

It was more than a year ago
at The ethical society.

The lecture was on "Music and meaning".

I see. The mistake arose
out of my card, did it?

The lady who called here yesterday thought
you were calling as well and would find you here.

In the afternoon, I said to my wife...

I said to mrs. Bast,
"I have to pay a call on some friends."

Mrs. Bast said to me, "Do go".

But while I was gone,
she wanted me on important business...

and thought I had come here,
owing to the card.

I tender my apologies, and hers...

for any inconvenience
we may have caused you.

None at all.
I still don't understand.

When did you say you paid
this afternoon call?

In the afternoon, of course.

Saturday afternoon or Sunday?

Saturday.
Really?

And you were still calling on Sunday
when your wife came here?

A long visit.

It was good of you to come and explain, mr Bast.

The rest is no concern of ours.

We are going upstairs for coffee.
I do hope you will join us.

Annie, pour the coffee.
It's not what you think.

I was...

i left my office and walked.

Right out of London.

I was walking all Saturday night.

All night? In the dark?

So dark I couldn't see my own hand.

Mr. Bast, you must be
a born explorer.

I tried to steer by Pole star, but
everything gets mixed and I lost it.

Don't tell me about Pole star.

It goes round and round,
and you go round with it.

Yes, but why?
Why did you do it?

I wanted to just walk.

Just get out.

I've been reading The Ordeal
of Richard Feverel.

I remember. There's that chapter
where Richard walks all night.

In a forest by moonlight.
What was that wonderful...

i know exactly what you mean.

"The forest drooped glimmeringly."

Wait, I'll get it.

The chapter's called "Nature speaks".

Where do your people come from?
London.

Yes, I know. I mean before that.

They didn't always live in a town.

No. They came
from around Shropshire.

They worked on the land.

They were agricultural laborers.

There. You see?
It was ancestral voices calling you.

Here it is.

"Richard was walking hurriedly.

A pale gray light on the skirts of
the flying tempest displayed the dawn."

Did you see the dawn?
Yes, suddenly it got light.

Was it wonderful?
No.

It was only gray. Anyway, by that time
i was so tired and hungry...

i didn't know when you're walking,
you want breakfast, lunch and tea.

All I had was a packet of Woodbines.

Give Mr. Bast money!

We really must go.

Meg, come on.

Mr. Bast wouldn't know what to do
if you gave him money.

Nonsense. Money is educational,
more than the things it buys.

Such crass materialism
out of your mouth.

Give him money.
Let us give Mr. Bast money.

What would it profit him if he gained
the whole world and lost his own soul?

He won't gain his soul until he has
enough money. Give Mr. Bast money.

Good-bye.

Thank you.

What do you think is
the most important thing in the world?

I suppose it is whatever matters
to you most.

Like love, for instance?
Like love or Oxford, if you're Tibby.

Henry Wilcox.
Oh, hello!

Good evening.
How nice to see you.

Wonderful surprise.
I heard two ladies talking of love.

We were continuing
a serious discussion.

Yes. We belong to a club which meets
once a week to discuss subjects.

How are you? I would have thought
you'd be down at Howards End.

Howards End is let.
We've bought a house in Mayfair.

Supposing you were a millionaire.

But I expect you are one.

We have met a young man who is poor,
sensitive and intelligent.

We wondered, if one was a millionaire,
how one could help him.

What's his profession?
He's a clerk in...

The Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company.

Porphyrion?
Yes.

Then, miss Schlegel,
if I were to help your young clerk...

i'd advise him to clear out of
The Porphyrion with all possible speed.

Why?
This is between friends, understand.

The Porphyrion will be in
the receivers' hands before christmas.

In other words, it'll smash.

Do you hear?
Helen, The Porphyrion will smash!

We must warn Mr. Bast
to get another place.

I hope quickly.

But rather than wait to make sure?
Decidedly.

The man already in a situation
when he applies for work...

stands a much better chance.

This is letting you
into state secrets...

but it does affect an employer greatly.

Human nature, I'm afraid.

Our human nature
appears to be the other way.

We employ people because
they're unemployed. The boot man.

How does he clean the boots?
Not well.

There you are.

Is it difficult for a clerk
to get a situation?

Yes, extremely.
I'm so sorry about Howards End.

That you're not living there.

I have some idea how much
her house meant to mrs. Wilcox.

Yes, but to us, the family,
it has certain drawbacks.

Would you be able to help our friend
to a new situation?

Well, unfortunately we have
very few positions and vacancies.

When there is one,
there's always hundreds of applicants.

Of course.

It has been a pleasure.
Yes, indeed.

I hope your young clerk
finds success.

Thank you. Good night.

He was in a hurry to get away.

Mr. Bast, I fear you may have thought
our letter a little odd.

We're not odd,
just over expressive.

The more a lady has to say, the better.
Ladies brighten every conversation.

I know, the darlings
are regular sunbeams.

Your company is The Porphyrion,
isn't it?

Would you call it a solid concern?

Cake? This big one
or one of these little deadlies?

It depends what you mean by solid.

We were told
The Porphyrion's a no-go.

A friend of ours did think
that it's insufficiently reinsured.

And advised you to clear out.
You can tell your friend he's wrong.

Oh, good!

Wrong, so to speak.

How, so to speak?

I wouldn't say he was right altogether.

Then he is right partly?

Tell your friend
to mind his own business.

Mr. Wilcox, miss Wilcox.

What a surprise!

Pardon the intrusion.
Mr. Wilcox, do come in.

Please forgive us
for this unexpected visit.

Mr. Bast, come play
with the puppies.

This is Mr. Bast.

I must be going.

Must you really?
Oh, come again.

No, I shan't come again.

I call that a very rude remark.
What do you want to turn on me for?

I thought you invited me here
for a friendly chat.

Instead you want to pick my brains
about my place of business.

Oh, yes, cross-question him,
pick his brains?

Are we intruding?
Shall we go?

Helen, go after him. Explain.

What was all that about?

I shouldn't have come. Before was all
right, but things like that get spoiled.

Things do, but people don't!

Don't you understand? We really did
want to warn you about The Porphyrion.

We were worried about you.

Why should you worry about me?

Because we like you!
That's why!

You noodle.
No cause to call a person names.

There is when a person
is being tremendously stupid.

Listen, this is serious.

Our friend said you should look for
another post before anything happens.

Will you?
I'll think about it.

You must do more. You must search for
another place while you still have one.

Promise you'll do that at least?
Please!

Ali right.

Thank you, miss Schlegel.

Come and tell us when you've found
another place. Or just come anyway.

Don't say no.
Don't dare to say no!

And don't forget your umbrella
or you'll say we pinched it.

You ought to be more careful. Your
servants should not let such people in.

But we invited him in.

We wanted to see him again,
talk to him and maybe help him.

Not only in a practical way.

You're too kind. You behave too well
to people, and then they impose on you.

I know the world and that type of man.

But he is not a type.

No. He is a quite unusual young man.
And he has something in him.

I don't know what it is except he wants
something better than he's got.

Oh.
Yes.

He has romantic ambition.

It is your view of him
that is romantic.

We wish you to have something
to remember mrs. Wilcox by...

in return for your kindness.

Oh, thank you so much.

What a lovely thought.
Thank you.

She would want you to have it.
She spoke very fondly of you.

It's beautifull
are you sure?

Is it 18th century?
Must be crystal.

Thank you.
Thank you, Evie.

What's she look like?

An old maid type. Goodness knows
why father wanted me to ask her.

She talks and talks...
here she is.

Miss Schlegel.
Miss Wilcox.

How do you do?
This is my fiance Percy Cahill.

How do you do?

Ah, good afternoon!
Hello. I didn't expect to see you.

Evie told me of her little plot,
so I secured a table. Evie, sit there.

Miss Schlegel, if you please here.

Mr. Cahill, there.

Are you still worrying around
after your young clerks?

I hope you're hungry.
Famished. I want to eat heaps.

Good. What will you have?

Fish pie.

Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson's.
It's not a fit thing to go for here.

Go for something for me then.
Right.

Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding
and cider to drink.

That's the type of thing to go for.

I like this place. It's so thoroughly
old english. Don't you agree?

I began an inventory of our possessions.

There are over 300 things
in the drawing room alone. Thank you.

And that's not counting the books!
Whatever shall I do?

The modern ownership of movables
is reducing us again to a nomadic horde.

We are averting
to a civilization of luggage, mr Wilcox.

Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

Always tip the carver.
"Tip everybody" is my motto.

Perhaps it does make life more human.
And these fellows remember one again.

Especially in the east. If you tip,
they'll remember you from year to year.

Have you been in the east?
Yes. Greece, Livanatai.

I used to go for sport
and business to Cyprus.

A few piastres help
to keep one's memory green.

How shockingly cynical.

Not a bit.
Simply realistic.

How would you like your meat?
Well-done.

You don't like cheese.
You never take cheese.

I adore cheese.
You said you didn't.

That's the most despicable lie.
You've grown quite pink.

I haven't.
Your ears are pink about the tips.

I like that.

Miss Schlegel expects me to act
as house agent for her.

I want a new home in September,
and someone must find it. I can't.

Do you know of anything, Percy?

Can't say I do.

I wish you would give us
Howards End.

I'm afraid it's let.

Can't you turn out your tenant,
let it to us?

We're nearly demented.

Mr. Wilcox, I am demented.

One bit of advice.

Fix your district, fix your price,
then don't budge.

That's how I got Ducie Street
and Oniton.

I shall...

I shall look around for you.

Would you?
Yes.

Would you really?
How kind!

I warn you, the house has not been built
that would suit the Schlegel family.

It's no fun trying to help us.

Fun? No, but a pleasure
and a privilege...

to do whatever I can
for miss Margaret Schlegel.

Thank you very much.

"Dear miss Schlegel...

dare I intrude on your holiday in Devon
and request you to come up to London?

Where, I may add,
you are greatly missed.

Matter is of some urgency."

But to interrupt your holiday!

And before we have undertaken
any of our excursions.

You haven't even been
to Nine Barrows Down.

I know, but I shall be back
before long.

Let me go up to town today,
and take the house if it's possible.

Whose house is this?

Mr. Wilcox's.
Are you being obtuse on purpose?

Look. "Owing to changed circumstances..."

he means that Evie's getting married.
That's his daughter.

"I no longer have need
for a London house of this size...

and am willing to let it
on a yearly tenancy."

It's perfect.

Out of all our acquaintances,
Mr. Wilcox is the only one who stuck...

and yet we've met
far more interesting people.

Interesting people
don't get one houses.

I shall never forget that dreadful
motor drive with that dreadful Charles.

My one consolation is that I was able
to be useful to you girls.

Thank you, aunt Juley.

And now it is my turn to be useful.

This is the ballroom.

Goodness!

Like it?
Rather!

Even I know a good thing
when I see it.

Yes, but nowadays with
Evie always out with her fiance...

when I get home in the evenings,
I can't stand the place.

It would be very lonely for you.
Yes.

Do you ever get lonely?

I soon shall horribly.

It's heartbreaking to leave
one's old home.

Goodness! How high
this ceiling must be.

Yes, it must be over 30 feet.
No, maybe 40, I should think.

Perhaps even more.

I've had you up here
on false pretenses.

I want to speak on a much more
serious matter than the house.

Do you think you could
be induced to share...

I mean, is it at all probable...

Oh, yes, I see.

Miss Schlegel...

Margaret, I don't think
you quite understand.

Oh, yes, indeed yes.

I'm asking you to be my wife.
Yes, I know. I know.

Are you offended?
How could I be?

Perhaps I should have written first.

No! Rather you will receive
a letter from me.

Thank you.
Not at all. And it's you I thank.

Should I order the motor around now?

That would be most kind.

I am warning you, Evie,
she will never set foot in this house.

It's not my fault!
Of course it's your fault.

Going around hobnobbing
with those Schlegel girls.

They're hardly girls.

I never dreamt of such a thing.

Dad took me to call,
and made me ask her to Simpson's.

I'm altogether off dad.

You've woken diddums.
I knew you would.

Well, miss Schlegel's fairly
got us on toast.

She always meant to get hold
of Howards End.

Now, thanks to you,
she's got it.

I call that most unfair.

Evie, why don't you pretend
to break off your engagement?

Then perhaps your father
will also quarrel with miss Schlegel.

Stop talking nonsense.

I'll get married as soon as possible,
and dad can do what he likes.

Taking mother's place.
The idea!

I could scratch
that woman's eyes out.

Tootle, tootle.

Come on, Dolly, I'll have a try.

It's no use talking.

We're in a bad hole,
and must make the best of it.

But I'll keep my eye
on those Schlegels.

And if I find them putting on airs
with their artistic beastliness...

i intend to put my foot down.

Yes. Firmly.

I've had a letter, too. Not a nice one.
I want to talk it over with you.

My letter's about Howards End.
The tenants have decamped.

What is worse,
he's trying to sublet the house.

What are you laughing at?

You haven't had a chance to talk
with Helen yet, have you?

A talk with her?
Well, do before you go.

What's the matter?
I'm anxious you two should be friends.

We've always hit it off together.
We do.

There's no clause in the agreement
to allow subletting. Read it yourself.

That's awfully jolly.
Thank you.

Yes, especially that.

Foxgloves.
Yes, dear old digitalis.

Digitalis.
Sounds like a sneeze.

Margaret, such nice news from Mr. Bast!
Really?

Good. Here we all are, then.

Mr. Bast is now with Dempster's bank.
That's his news.

Thanks to your hint,
he cleared out of The Porphyrion.

Not a bad business, the porphyrion.

I shall have to go to Howards End
and take charge. I'd like you to come.

Not a bad business?
I would like that very much.

Good. What about tomorrow?
Tomorrow? I couldn't well do that.

You told us The Porphyrion
would smash before christmas.

Did i? Yes, it was outside
the tariff ring at the time.

Took some rather bad policies.

Lately it came in. Safe as houses now.
What's wrong with tomorrow?

Aunt Juley would be so disappointed
if I left now.

Didn't Mr. Wilcox clearly tell us...
Yes. Let's talk about it later.

Aunt Juley regards this...

now it turns out it's safe as houses,
and Mr. Bast should never have left...

at a greatly reduced salary.

My dear Helen, I grieve
for your clerk. I really do.

But it is part of the battle of life.

Battle of life? A man who had
little money has less, owing to us.

Come, come. You're not to blame.
No one is to blame.

Is no one to blame for anything?
I didn't say that.

You take things far too seriously.

There's your aunt.
I'll have a word with her.

Helen, word of advice...
I require no more advice!

Don't take up a sentimental attitude
over the poor.

See that she doesn't, Margaret.

The poor are poor.
One is sorry for them, but there it is.

I'll talk to aunt Juley about tomorrow.
Don't you bother.

Girls, aren't you cold?

I am very sorry about Mr. Bast,
but you must be civil to Henry.

You, yourself, are a witness.
There may be another side to this question.

Henry is my future husband...

and I must be on his side.

Why are you so bitter?

Because I'm an old maid.

Oh, Helen!

Oh, darling!

Margaret will explain.

It isn't true what Mr. Wilcox says,
that you want to go away tomorrow?

We must leave tomorrow.

I have business at Howards End...

and my business is now, fortunately,
my Margaret's.

That's it.
So this is the famous office.

I had expected something
more African.

Heavens no!

Spears, animal skins,
and that sort of thing.

I expect this is the imperial part of
the Imperial and West African Company.

We haven't settled the question
of the London house.

That all depends.
On what?

When do you want to marry me?
My head's in a whirl!

I hope that my wife...
Oh. How do you do?

Will give you a decent lunch
after you've looked at Howards End.

I can hardly wait to see it,
although I almost feel I have.

I don't know in what state
you'll find it.

The tenant decamped without arranging
for a charwoman to clear up after him.

Yes. I've more than a little bone
to pick with the tenant.

Margaret, here's an idea.

Why don't we use Howards End to store
your furniture from Wickham Place...

until you decide
what to do with it?

Would you really?
Good idea?

How kind.

Only until Helen and Tibby
are settled, of course, Charles.

I hope you won't be disappointed.

It's quite a measly little place.
It never really suited us.

Heavens no.

Good. It's lovely!

Oh dear.
What?

I seem to have forgotten the keys.
I've lost the keys.

We'll have to go back.
Won't you leave me here?

Sure?
I'll wait for you.

Have a glass of milk at the farmer's.
Henry, see she gets some milk.

Good-bye.

Why did you forget the key?
Sorry.

Where did you leave it?
It could be with diddums.

Hello.

I took you for Ruth Wilcox!

I, like mrs. Wilcox?

You have her way of walking...

'round the house.

Henry, I found the teeth!
The pig's teeth.

Where?
The pig's teeth in the bark.

Look. Here. You see?

Four feet up.
How extraordinary.

Yes, and you chew the bark
to kill the toothache.

What a rum notion.
Surely you knew that.

Did silly miss Avery
give you a fright?

None of you girls
has any nerve.

Did you take her for a spook?
She's very odd.

She carries on as if she owned
Howards End.

Miss Avery has always lived there?

Yes, she grew up on the farm
like mrs. Wilcox.

Weren't she and mrs. Wilcox friends
when Howards End, too, was a farm?

They say that mrs. Wilcox had a brother.
Or was it an uncle?

Anyhow, he popped the question,
and miss Avery said "no."

If she'd said "Yes",
she'd have been Charles' aunt.

That's rather good!
Charlie's aunt!

I must chaff him about that.

She's mad about Howards End.

Goodness knows what she'll do
when your furniture arrives.

She might fling it all out!

Or she might simply adopt it
for Howards End.

Excuse me, sir. Where would I go
to inquire about a position?

What position would that be, sir?

I heard there was one.
Not at this time.

I thought it was you.
How do you do?

Why did you never come
to see us again? You promised.

This isn't your bank.
You took a situation with Dempster's.

Lost it.
Sorry?

I lost the situation.
They cut back on their staff.

The last to join, like me,
were the first to be let go.

I've been inquiring
for another place here.

The way they look at you
when you come to ask.

They're sure you've stolen something.
A decent person wouldn't be out of work.

It's our fault.

We made you leave The Porphyrion.
I and my sister and Mr. Wilcox.

Who is at this very moment celebrating
his daughter's wedding at his castle in Shropshire.

With the maximum of expense
and ostentation. I could murder him!

"Murder without is most foul."

How have you been?
Any interesting lectures?

He jolly well owes you a situation.

What nice houses you have all over the place.

I like this one, too.
Oniton Grange.

I'm waiting to get it off my hands.
Why?

What is one to do? The shooting is bad,
and the fishing is even worse.

Anyway, it's in the wrong part
of Shropshire.

Are these all Wilcoxes?

Heavens no! I bought the place
lock, stock and barrel.

The fellow just took the money,
and cleared off. To Italy, I think.

Some of these are rather good.
What do you think?

They're lovely.
Rather good, isn't it?

Which?
Top one.

Yes, it's very grand.
Rather like you.

So, I'll show you the cellar.

It's very damp.

Do you have enough ice?
Yes, sir.

Second orders? Good.

All right, this way.

It is difficult to decide
what to do about the children.

Charles, as the eldest,
will have Howards End.

I'm anxious not to be unjust
to the others.

Of course not. You mean money?
Yes money, since you put it so frankly.

Goodness! We'll never get through
all this wine.

How much have you got?
What?

How much have you got per year?
I have 600.

My income?

Don't you know your income?
Of course I do.

Or don't you want to tell me?

Do it this way. If you were to divide
your income into ten parts...

how many parts would you give
to Charles, to Evie and to Paul?

Go ahead, give away all you can.
Be generous.

Divide yours, too.

She'll get her hands on this place
as well as Howards End.

It's only her furniture
that's gone there.

That's the thin edge of the wedge.

What's to happen to us?
Two children to bring up.

Charles, you're pleased
about the baby, aren't you?

What? Oh!
Pleased as punch!

But it's not going to be easy.

The pater wants to be fair,
but money isn't elastic.

What if Evie has a family?

Or the pater himself?

What?

Who's there?

Saxon or celt?

It went like clockwork.

"Quite like a durbar",
lady Edser said.

You did awfully well.

I'm very proud of you.
Thank you.

It was very successful.

Who are those people?

Perhaps townspeople
come to see the wedding presents.

If you'll gracefully vanish,
I'll deal with them.

What is it? What's wrong?
Is Tibby ill?

I found them starving!

Who?
The Basts!

He lost his place.

They reduced their staff,
and he was the first to go!

Yes, thanks to us. We've ruined him!
Are you mad?

If you like,
but I'll stand for this no longer.

Two people starving,
and all this vulgar show!

Have you actually brought two starving
people from London to Shropshire?

There was a restaurant car
on the train.

Don't be absurd! I won't have
such theatrical nonsense!

Yes, how dare you?
Bursting into Evie's wedding.

My goodness! You've a perverted notion
of philanthropy. Look at them.

They think it's some vulgar scandal...

and I must explain,
"No, it's only my sister screaming...

and only two hangers-on of ours
she has brought here for no reason."

We want to see Mr. Wilcox.

Mr. Bast, this is an odd business.
What view do you take of it?

There is mrs. Bast, too.
Yes. How do you do?

She's unwell. She fainted on the train.
I'm so sorry. Won't you sit down?

We don't wish to intrude, but you and
your sister have been kind in the past.

My sister has put you
in a false position.

Helen, offer them something. Mrs. Bast,
won't you have something to eat?

Please.

I would like to do something
for them.

We are, in some way, responsible.
Via Mr. Wilcox.

If you take up that attitude,
I'll do nothing. So choose.

If you promise to take them
to the hotel, quietly, as my guests...

then I will speak to Henry
about finding work for Mr. Bast.

There is to be no more
of this absurd screaming.

Well?

All right. I promise.

Very well. Take them to The George,
and I'll try.

But, Helen...

you have been most self-indulgent.

You have less restraint rather than more
as you get older.

Think it over...

and alter yourself.

Or we shant have happy lives.

Let's eat some cake, shall we?

You want some strawberries?

Sorry. Excuse me.

I must see to getting some rooms.

We don't want to be any trouble.
We shall come with you.

Perhaps you'd like to stay?
There's all this pudding.

Mrs. Bast is extremely tired.
I'm hungry!

Perhaps you should come back for her?

Will you be all right?
I'll be all right!

Charles, look.

Whoever's that? Pink scarf.

Charles Wilcox.
How do you do?

Bride or groom?

Pleased to have made your acquaintance.

Champagne, madam?

Helen? Here?

But she refused the invitation.
I thought she despised weddings.

Where is she now?
Gone. I've bundled her to The George.

George hotel?
You shouldn't have done that.

She has two of her proteges with her.

Yes, her protege.
Well, let them all come.

No, but...

Later on I would like
to talk to you about them.

Why not now?
No time like the present.

Shall I?

Yes, if it isn't too long a story.

It's not five minutes.

But there's a sting at the end of it.

For I want you to find the man
some work in your office.

What are his qualifications?

He's a clerk, I think.

Where was he before?
Dempster's bank.

Dempster's.
Why did he leave?

They reduced their staff.

Yes.

I'll see what I can do.

Margaret, this cannot be taken
as a precedent.

I can't fit in your proteges
or Helen's every day. You do understand?

Of course. Of course not.

But he's rather a special case.

Proteges always are, aren't they?

Why, if it isn't Henry!

Hello, Henry.

Fancy seeing you here.

This is mrs. Bast.
I'm sorry, she's a little overtired.

She's drunk.
Don't you remember Jacky?

Henry, aren't you going
to say "Hello"?

Do you know mrs. Bast?
No, I don't!

Know Henry?

Who doesn't know Henry?
We've had some gay old times...

You're drunk!

Are you satisfied? I can now understand
your keen interest in the Basts.

I congratulate you
on your little plan to trap me.

I release you from your engagement.
Thank you.

Here we are.
Please don't bother, my dear.

I'm sure I can manage.

That's all right. I'll do that.
I'll do it.

So that's it.
That is what?

Thank you, dear chap.
You were saying?

Henry and I were having the fiercest
argument, but I think he's forgiven me.

I don't expect there's much
to forgive.

I really must be going,
or we should be late.

Thank you so much
for the loveliest time.

And hasn't the weather
been kind to us?

A lovely day.
Thank you very much.

Have a safe journey.

Bye-bye, Dolly.
You take care of yourself.

I shall.

Oh, I've forgotten my hat.
It's here, father.

Thank you.

Are the women folk all right?

Shut the doors and we're ready.

Well, thank you...

Oh, oh. Drive on.

What's the matter, Jacky?

It was a jolt seeing him.

Him? Seeing who?

I don't want to talk about it.

What do you think you're looking at?

Henry, look at me.

So, you were that woman's lover?

Put with your usual delicacy.
Yes, I was.

When? When, please?

Ten years ago!

I'm sorry. Ten years ago.

Henry dear,
it's not going to trouble us.

Yes, we fellows all fall from grace
once in our time.

You believe that, Margaret?
Yes, I do believe it.

You with your refined pursuits
and your books...

what can you guess of any man's life,
his temptations?

Temptations.

Well, that's enough.
I've spoken too much already.

Yes, that's enough, dear.

It was in Cyprus.
I was very lonely.

You can never forgive me, can you?
I have forgiven you.

I could find an excuse,
but I won't.

Let us speak no more about it, dear.
It is all behind us.

Really?

You can really bring yourself
to forgive me?

You've learned
that I'm far from a saint.

In fact, the reverse.
No, no, no. The reverse.

Where are those people now?
Helen took them to The George.

Oh. Then let them leave
first thing in the morning.

There must be no gossip
at The George.

And anyway,
Helen should be here with us...

not stopping at a hotel
with some ragtags.

Why don't you kindly write a note
to that effect?

I'll have Burton send it over
to Helen straightaway.

Yes, sir?

I want you to take a note
to The George hotel straightaway.

There's far too much noise
out there.

"I'm sorry to tell you that Henry
can do nothing for Mr. Bast.

He feels the Basts are not at all
the type we should trouble about.

We found the woman drunk
on the lawn.

Please see that they leave
first thing in the morning...

and come here yourself."

He made her write it.
This isn't Margaret.

Would you put it in the fire?

You better let us be.
You don't want to get mixed up in this.

In what?

What is it?

You must trust me that far
at least!

Mr. Wilcox met Jacky before.

Out in Cyprus when she was 16.

I told you you didn't want
to hear about it.

Go on.
Why was she in Cyprus?

Her father was a clerk
in an export business.

After her mother died,
she'd gone out to be with him.

Then he died.

Accidentally drowned
because he couldn't swim.

Jacky was left having to fend
for herself...

till she managed to get back home.

I didn't have to marry her,
but I did.

My family tried to stop me.

But I married her all the same,
because I promised.

If I hadn't, where would she be after
the Mr. Wilcoxes had finished with her?

It would never,
not in a thousand years...

enter that man's mind
he'd done anything wrong.

Because there's nothing here,
and nothing here!

And you're the opposite. You believe
in personal responsibility...

and personal everything.

Very nice. What good am I
to myself or to Jacky?

Marrying her, only to pull her down
with me so we can starve together.

Surely you'll find
another position somewhere.

You don't know
what you're talking about.

If rich people fail at one position,
they can try another.

But with us...

once a man over 20 loses
his own particular job, he's done for.

I'd do anything in the world
to help you.

Help me row, then.
I'm tired.

You're the one person
who ever has helped me.

You mean by passing on false information
to make you give up your job?

I mean by being
the sort of person you are.

I didn't think people like you existed
except in books.

And books aren't real.
They're more real than anything!

When people fail you,
there's still "Music and meaning".

That's for rich people to make them
feel good after their dinner.

Everything's got spoiled for you,
hasn't it?

L don't know what's to be done, Tibby,
or what to say to Meg.

I don't want to face her
or even go back to Wickham Place.

You mean, because of Mr. Wilcox...

and the woman you say
he seduced in Cyprus?

I want you to give Meg my love,
and tell her...

tell her I'm going away to Germany,
to Munich.

Or else Bonn.
Such a message is easily given.

God, I wish I could escape
from Meg's wedding, too.

Is she really going through with it?
How can our Meg be a Wilcox?

And now, after all this?

You better go to Germany.

It's Martlett with the apple charlotte.
Mind if I take it? It spoils.

Shall I clear now, sir?
Not now. Later.

Very good.

I feel... no, I know,
we owe the Basts some compensation.

Those people again?
Yes, those people again.

I don't see who is to pay
if I don't.

I'm placing what I consider
is a minimum amount to your account.

When I'm in Germany,
you'll pay it to the Basts for me.

I shall never forget your kindness
if you do this.

What's the sum?

Five thousand.
Good god!

It's useless giving out driblets
of charity, just shillings and blankets.

No doubt people will think me mad.

I don't give a damn what people think!

But I do mind if you ruin yourself
for some quixotic reason of your own.

I didn't expect you to understand me.

I understand nobody.
But you'll do it?

Apparently.

Are you writing to your brother?
He could send us another ten.

Yes, and a long lecture with it.

Your sister could afford a fiver.
Leave me alone!

Why are you taking it out on me?

You can see I'm busy, can't you?

"Dear Mr. Schlegel...

I acknowledge receipt of your letter
enclosing a check for 5,000 pounds.

I am very grateful for your concern,
but having no immediate necessity...

i have the honor to return
your check herewith.

Yours sincerely, Leonard Bast."

Excuse me, sir.

Sorry to bother you.
I worked in this office for four years.

I was wondering
if there were any vacancies.

No, I'm sorry.
I've nothing.

Nothing at all?
Nothing at this time.

The servants will have benefit of the
central heating if we keep them here...

instead of at the back of the house,
which the architect prefers.

If only it would hurry up
and get itself built.

All in good time.

I'm getting tired of living in London.
I can't be as young as I was.

I'm perfectly happy to do without
the new plays and discussion societies.

Mr. Shaw, Mr. Wells
and all the other utopias.

What I miss are trees
and mountains and meadows.

I also miss my own things.

They're safe now at Howards End.

I'm grateful to have them there.

But I would like to see them
in our own home.

My share at least. Goodness only knows
what Tibby intends to do with his.

Or Helen.

There's been another postcard
from her.

Still the same poste restante address
in Bavaria...

but now she speaks
of going to Italy.

She's never coming back to England.

She's been away now...

how long has it been?
Four months, three weeks on Tuesday.

Your sister is odd. She always has been.
No getting away from it.

What's this?

What've you been reading now?

Theo...

Theosophy.
Yes.

Madam Blavatsky.

What a clever little woman it is.

That's what I mean about Helen.

She reads these things,
and her mind gets addled.

My Margaret keeps her facts straight.

What facts are those, dear?
About men and women.

All that sort of thing.
Who is who and what is what.

Yes. What is that?

Mr. Schlegel, sir,
you've forgotten this.

Thank you.

Oh, dear, Annie.
Look, it's another one.

But no letter.

I just can't feel
that Helen's really alive.

These postcards and telegrams
don't seem to have come from her.

That's not her!

I know what you mean. You'll break that
if you keep fiddling with it.

Put it on.

"M.J. Schlegel, The Rise,
Straight Fleming, Devon.

Dearest Meg,
arriving London thursday.

Please telegraph care my bank...

whether aunt Juley is better
or likely to become worse.

Give my love to the invalid,
and keep some for yourselves. Helen."

If only you had a companion
to take your walks with.

I have Tibby, dear aunt Juley.

And it won't be long... thank you.
Before you'll be up and about.

When is Helen coming?

Very soon. She will already
have reached London.

She's got to London.

But?

She says to telegraph
if aunt Juley is better.

Obviously if we want to see her,
we must telegraph that she is not.

We can't start lying to each other.
Helen wouldn't...

she couldn't stay away
at such a time.

"Dearest Helen...

aunt Juley better and eagerly
expecting you as am I.

Your Meg."

"Must return Germany at once.

Telegraph to bank whereabouts
are books and furniture. Helen."

Why did she have to go back
to Germany?

I'll explain it all after your nap.

She might have come to see her aunt.
I haven't been well.

Is cook doing the mackerel
the way Tibby likes them?

I know his whole day is spoiled
if his breakfast isn't right.

The mackerel were perfect.
Tibby mentioned them this morning.

Don't tell me
it is still that business...

over Henry and that woman mrs. Bast.

Goodness me! How morbid!

His wife forgives him, and his
sister-in-law can't bear to look at him.

I don't believe it,
not even of Helen.

We all know to what extremes Helen goes.
We've suffered under her temperament.

This is different,
this is not temperament...

but a kind of madness...

as if she were mad.

Margaret, you've got black marks again
under your eyes.

You know that's strictly forbidden.

Can't have my girl looking
as old as her husband.

You haven't quite seen our point.

I don't suppose I ever shall.
Our point is this.

Our sister may be mad.

Charles, do come in.

We are again in trouble.
Can you help us at all?

No, I'm afraid I cannot.
What were the facts?

We're all mad,
more or less, these days.

The facts are that our sister
has been in England and won't see us.

She's forbidden the bankers
to give us her address.

She refuses to answer any questions.
Ail we have are these telegrams.

And you want to get hold of her?

Well... yes.

Perfectly easy, Margaret.

She wants her books, yes?
Send her after them to Howards End.

When she's there,
you just stroll in.

If there's nothing wrong with her,
so much the better.

But remember the motor
will be around the corner.

We can run her to a specialist
in no time.

But that's impossible!
Why is it impossible?

Because Helen and I, we...

don't speak
that particular language...

if you see my meaning.

Yes, because you have scruples.
It's all very well and I understand.

I am as scrupulous as any man alive,
I hope.

But when it is a case like this,
when it is a question of madness...

I deny it's madness!

You said so yourself.
It's madness when I say it, not you.

Pater, we may as well
keep Howards End out of it.

Why?

The whole house is at sixes and sevens.
We don't want any more mess.

And who is we?

Pray, Charles, who is we?

I beg your pardon I'm sure.

I seem always to be intruding.

Let's send the telegram.

Come along. Let's do it.

I really can't have this sort of behavior.

What?
Margaret.

She's far too sweet natured to mind.
But I mind for her.

"All your books now at Howards End.

Miss Avery will let you in
3:00 p.m. Monday. Meg."

Our main object is not to frighten
miss Schlegel. You understand?

The trouble seems to be nervous.
Wouldn't you say so, Margaret?

Would you say she was normal?

She's always been highly strung.

Musical, literary, artistic.

But quite normal.
Quite a charming girl really.

Would you say
there was anything congenital?

Anything hereditary?

Margaret?
Henry, just wait here for a second.

Oh, darling! Quickly!
Just get inside, please!

Miss Schlegel is managing.

You can go back to the motor.
Margaret?

I shall surely need your advice later,
but now I must be alone with Helen.

You're certain?
Yes. Please, my dear, kind Henry.

Thank you.

Why all our furniture?
There's been a mistake.

How well the carpet fits.

I'll be sending some milk 'round,
and we should be ordering coals.

There's been a mistake.
You've been very kind.

But we are not going to live
at Howards End. This is not our house.

I think she may be a little touched.

I'm sorry, Helen.
I ought not to have...

no, you ought not
to have tricked me this way.

We thought you were ill!

As you see, I'm not ill,
but I'm expecting a child in June.

Is the coast clear?
I must leave.

I'm going back to Germany
in the morning.

My love to aunt Juley and Tibby.

Let me carry that.

It's curious, isn't it,
that our carpet fits?

Yes, the sword looks right, too.

Yes, doesn't it?

Someone's polished it.

Yes.

I'll carry this.

If you didn't want to tell me
because of Henry, I'd understand that.

I thought I had to be by myself.
That's why I hid away in Germany.

What about Tibby?

Really, I alone must be responsible
for myself and this child.

And I want to be.

Of course Leonard doesn't know.

Leonard?

Leonard Bast?

Yes.

Did you ever hear from him again?

I have no idea
what he's doing now...

or what's happened
to either of them.

My dear, I must ask you.

Was your sister wearing
a wedding ring?

No.
What?

I really came just to ask a favor
about Howards End.

Yes. One point at a time.
Please, sit down.

I must now ask you
the name of her seducer.

You may have some inkling,
and the slightest hint would help us.

Who is us?

I thought it best to ring Charles.

That was unnecessary.

My dear...

Charles and I wish to act
in your sister's best interests.

It is still not too late
to clear her name.

Are we to make her seducer
marry her?

Suppose he turned out to be married?
One has heard of such cases.

Then he must pay heavily
for his misconduct, mustn't he?

Stay calm.

I want to talk to you.

Listen to me.

Come here.

Look at me.

What's the matter?

May I ask you my question now?
Certainly.

Tomorrow Helen goes to Germany.
I'm fine.

Tonight, with your permission,
she would like to sleep at Howards End.

Why at Howards End?

It is an odd request, but you know
what women in her state are.

I could understand
if it were her own home.

Associations and so on, but Helen has
no associations with Howards End.

I don't see why she wants to stay there.
She'll only catch cold.

Call it fancy, but she wants to.
I don't understand.

She'll then want to sleep two nights,
and never get out of the house.

Would that matter?
Of course.

We will only trouble Howards End
for this one night. I'll stay with her.

That's quite impossible.
I want you here to meet Charles.

What has Charles to do with this?
He's the future owner of Howards End.

It has everything to do with Charles.
In what way?

Please answer me.

You're forgetting yourself.
There's Dolly and the servants.

Would Helen's condition
depreciate the property?

I shall do what I can, but I can't treat
your sister as if nothing has happened.

I shall be false to my position
in society if I did.

Tomorrow she will go to Germany,
and trouble society no longer.

Tonight she asks to sleep
in your empty house.

May she?
Will you give my sister leave?

Will you forgive her...

as you, yourself,
have been forgiven?

As I have been...
please answer my question!

Your sister can sleep at the hotel.

I have my children and the memory
of my dear wife to consider.

You have mentioned mrs. Wilcox.

In reply, may I mention mrs. Bast?

You have not been yourself all day.
You had a mistress, I forgave you.

My sister has a lover,
you drive her from the house!

Why can you not be honest for once
and say to yourself...

"What Helen has done, I have done"?

I repeat what I said before.

I do not give your sister leave
to sleep at Howards End.

Do you understand?

If a man played about with my sister,
I'd send a bullet through him.

But I suppose
you're sunk too deep in books...

and rubbish
to mind what happens to your sister.

I mind very much
what happens to my sister.

But I have a different way
of expressing it from yours...

not to speak of different manners.

By jove, I'm glad of my way!

I'm glad my father never sent me to
university if this is what they teach.

Look, you must know something
of your sister's life.

Do you know of anyone?
No.

Whom do you suspect?

Did she mention anyone by name?

Come on, yes or no?
You're hiding something. Speak up.

She did mention some friend
called Leonard Bast.

Leonard Bast?

Do you know him?

Have you had any dealings with him?

What a family. What a family!
God help the poor pater.

God help my poor sisters.

They were ordered on approval!
Excuse me. Excuse me!

Wait.

Excuse me.
I was looking for miss Schlegel.

Leonard Bast. I used to call
at Wickham Place. Is miss Schlegel in?

Or mrs. Wilcox?
They're down at Howards End.

Where would that be, Howards End?

It's at Hilton.
Near Hilton Junction.

Are you all right?

Let me get you a drink of water.
No, thank you.

Please take them, ma'am.
Come on, off you go!

I don't want you to conclude...

that my wife and I have had
anything like a quarrel.

She is overwrought, naturally.

Naturally.

The question to my mind is connected
to something far greater:

The rights of property itself.

Absolutely.

The house is mine,
and will one day be yours, Charles.

When I say I don't want anyone
living at Howards End...

I mean that no one
is to live at Howards End.

Then tomorrow morning
I may go up in the motor?

Yes. Say that you're acting
as my representative...

and that they must clear out at once.

Go to bed now.
I've kept you up far too late.

Can I do anything for you, sir?

No, nothing.

Thank you, my boy.
Good night.

Good night, sir.

It's only the train.

Len, have you got
that pain again?

You're all dressed.
I'm going out for a bit.

What ho, Len.

What ho, Jacky.
See you again later.

Excuse me. Howards End.

Did you see the dawn?

And was it wonderful?
No.

It was only gray.

Excuse me.
Could you direct me to Howards End?

This is Howards End.

Thank you very much, Charles.

There are two boxes of books in...

miss Schlegel... mrs. Wilcox,
you will have forgotten me.

No, Mr. Bast,
I have not forgotten you.

I want to know
where your sister is.

Where Helen is.
Who is it?

So this is Leonard Bast.

This is for insulting a woman.

Get me a stick!
We are capable of dealing with this.

What are you doing?
Stand back!

Stand up!

It is your opinion that he was in
the last stages of heart disease.

It would not be professional
to say so before an autopsy but...

in private...

that could well be my diagnosis.

Obviously he was in
the last stage because...

the moment I touched him with the sword
he crumpled up.

Excuse me.
What sword would that have been?

It's inside.
You better follow me.

It's their father's old German sword.

Of course, I only touched him
with the flat of it.

Once?

Yes, once.
Perhaps twice.

I presume you will be staying
in Hilton, Mr. Wilcox.

Yes. I'll be available
as long as it's necessary.

And Mr. Charles Wilcox...

we shall be requesting your presence
at the inquest, sir.

Yes, I did expect that. I shall
naturally be the most important witness.

Margaret?

Good, Henry. I was going to come out
to Hilton to give you these.

I have something to tell you.

Never mind. I don't need to hear it.
I'm leaving you.

My life is with Helen now.
Yes.

I'm extremely tired.

Come and sit down for a moment.

Yes, for a moment.
We'll have to sit here on the grass.

Yes.

Here are your keys.

We shall be staying with miss Avery
at the farm till we can leave.

Yes.
Where are you going?

To Germany. We'll start as soon
as possible after the inquest.

After the inquest?
If Helen is well enough.

You realize what the verdict
of the inquest will be?

Yes.

Heart disease.

No, manslaughter...

if not worse.

Charles may go to prison.

I dare not tell him.

I don't know what to do.

I don't know what to do.

I'm sorry.

Is this going to suit everyone?

I don't want you all coming here later
complaining that I've been unfair. Paul?

Apparently it's got to suit us.

You've only to speak, my boy, and
I'll leave the house to you entirely.

Since I have to be at the business all
week, I'll find something more suitable.

This place is not really the country...

and it's certainly not the town.

Does my arrangement suit you, Evie?

Of course, father.
You, Dolly?

I thought Charles wanted it
for the boys.

But last time I saw him, he said no...

because we can't possibly live
in this part of England again.

Charles says we ought
to change our name.

But I can't think what to.

Wilcox just suits Charles and me.

I can't think of any other name.

Yes.

Then I leave Howards End
to my wife absolutely.

Let everyone understand that.

And after I'm dead,
there's to be no jealousy...

and no surprise.

In consequence, I leave my wife
no money. That is her own wish.

All my other assets
are to be divided among you.

This house, Howards End, she intends
at her death to leave to her nephew.

It does seem curious. Mrs. Wilcox
wanted Margaret to have Howards...

now she gets it after all.

Have I put my foot in it?

Tom, take baby's hand.

Look. What's over there?

I wonder what it is.

Oh, it's a sweet child.
Rather like diddums was at that age.

Come along, Dolly.

Look who's there! Look!

What did Dolly mean about Howards End?

My poor Ruth,
during her last days...

scribbled your name
on a piece of paper.

Knowing her not to be herself,
I set it aside.

I didn't do wrong, did i?

They're off.
There they go.
