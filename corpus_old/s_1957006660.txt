[sighs softly]

[exhales, in English]
We had some good timesâ€¦

[inhales sharply]
â€¦until you ruined everything.


You were the first humans I ever trustedâ€¦

And the last.

[elf grunting]

{\an8}[in Elvish]

[gasps, clears throat]

[in English] Speck.

Don't sneak up on someone like that.

{\an8}[Speck, in Elvish]

[in English] What took you so long?
[grunts]

{\an8}[shakily, in Elvish]

[in English] She better be, for your sake.

[Speck mumbles]
[Belsnickel sighs]

There's only five days left
until Christmas.

[elves and Kate giggling]
[player clicks, beeps]

Ugh.

An honest-to-God True Believer.

{\an8}Wellâ€¦ I'm about to change all of that.

[menacing music plays]
Track her down.

{\an8}[Speck, in Elvish]

[exhales]
[in English] She's perfect.

[Claire and man 1 laughing]

[man 2 whistles]


<i>â™ª Feliz Navidadâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Lamest Christmas ever.

Really?
Yeah.

What kind of person would wanna spend
the best holiday of the year

sitting on the hot beach
with fruity umbrella drinks?

Gonna go with just about everybody.

Well, not me.

Not when I could be at home baking cookies

and building snowmen with real snow.

And worst of all,
all my friends are having parties

and shopping, sledding.


you can do about it, okay?

So you might as well
just relax and try to have fun.

Think I liked you better
when you were a car thief.

I liked you better
when you weren't such a buzzkill.

Ugh, how embarrassing.
[Claire and man laughing]

[Claire exclaims]

[both continue laughing]

Hey, come on!
Hey!

[Claire] Ah!
[man 1 laughs]

Oh, so that's what this is about. Bob.

No, this is not about Bob.
I could care less about Bob.

He just brought us here
so he could kiss up to Mom.

Give him a break, Kate.
It means he really likes her.

It's too soon.
They've only been dating for ten months.

And they've known each other
a lot longer than that.

Besidesâ€¦ he makes Mom happy.

Yeah, well, he's not Dad.

[Kate sighs]
<i>CÃ³mo estÃ¡s,</i> party people?Â [chuckles]

What are we looking at?

[Claire and Bob giggling]
[Bob] Hey!

[Claire chuckles, kisses]

[Bob sings in Spanish]

Ugh! Now,
there's something you can't unsee.

Am I right?

What are the odds
my dad proposes on this trip?

Or maybe she does.

I mean,
your mom is a pretty progressive woman.

Teddy! I heard they have snorkeling.
You wanna go?

Yeah, one sec.

You two want to come?
Nope.

Yeah. Thanks for asking, Teddy,
but I've got horrible anxiety,

asthma, and about 11 different allergies.

All right. Um, well, suit yourselves.

Hey, cheer up, Grinch.

For a True Believer,
you're forgetting the number one rule.

"Better not pout."
[band continues singing]

[Bob's son] Hey, Kate! Wait up!
Another chocolate smoothie, please.

Make that two.
Can you prepare mine lactose-free?

Okay.
Thank you.


So what should we do?
"We"?

Oh, I'm gonna hang out by myself,
but why don't you try the waterslide?

Looks pretty fun.
And risk breaking my nose?

It's one of my best features.
[Claire sighs] Hey, guys.

They're having a caroling party
on the beach. You wanna join?

Yeah.
No, thanks.

Come on, Kate.
I heard you love singing Christmas carols.

Kate has a great singing voice.
She was lead vocalist in the school choir.

In fifth grade.

Really? So was I.

Really?
Yeah.

You know, nothing raises
the Christmas Spirit like music.

Come on. Music?
[chuckles] Yeah.

<i>â™ª O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How lovely are your branches â™ª</i>

[somber music plays]
[Bob clears throat]

[Claire sighs]
Did Iâ€¦ Did I do something wrong?

No, it's justâ€¦

That was her dad's favorite song.

I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
No, of course not. How could you?

[Bob sighs]

She's just being a teenager.

[bell ringing]
[seagulls crying]

Santa, I know it's probably too late
to write a letter,

and the Wi-Fi here stinks,

but if you're listening,
I want to amend my Christmas wish.

I mean,
the electric scooter would be really cool,

but I need something
more important than that right now.

I need to get out of this place.

Mom's basically ditching us
for this new guy and his scaredy-cat son.

["O Christmas Tree" playing]
It's so depressing.

And in a few weeks,
it's gonna be like Dad never even existed.

So, please, Santa,
help out a True Believerâ€¦

Or I swearâ€¦

I'm gonna run away.

[tense orchestral music playing]

So, you want to run away, eh?

I think we can make that happen.


I woke up this morning
with a little magic under the door.

We got some surprises,
compliments of the hotel.

What?

First up,

how would you like to mix it up
with manta rays

and tussle with turtles
on a snorkel adventure for two?

Whoa, sounds dope. I know somebody
who would love to go snorkeling.


Two lucky people get an opportunity
to have an overnight stay at Tulum

with a private tour of the Mayan ruins.

Are you serious?

and bring a sense of adventure.

An overnight in Tulum?
That sounds amazing.


Listen, the kids are gonna
have the time of their life

because,
while your family is off the resort,

why not stuff your bellies
with free ice cream

and choose
from dozens of fun-filled activities

at the Kids Club at a slumber party?

Slumber party?

Kate, we're gonna have so much fun.

Wait, but I'm too old
for Kids Club, right?


Actually, Kate, you just made the cut.

You're good.

Lucky you. [chuckles softly]
[Kate scoffs]

Wait. This isn't some trick
just to get us out of the way

so you can propose to Mom, is it?

Kate! Sorry.

Okay, first, you make us spend Christmas
on the freaking equator,

and now you don't even
wanna spend it together?

Okay. Excuse us.

Come on.
[Kate huffs]

Why are you acting so rude to Bob?

He's treating us to this incredible trip.
You should try not to forget that.

And you should try not to forget Dad.

["O Christmas Tree" playing]


andâ€¦ and I do.

Iâ€¦ I care about him very muchâ€¦

That doesn't mean
I love your father any less.

Yeah, well,
I just don't see how that's possible.

[Claire sighs, clicks tongue]

All right. [scoffs]
[horn honks]

Look, I'm just gonna tell Bob
we can't go to Tulum.

We'll justâ€¦ We'll stay here with you guys.

[passengers chattering]
Um, no. Um, actually, um, you should go.

But I can't. I'm notâ€¦

I'm not gonna just
leave you here like this.

It's okay, Mom.

I was being a brat.
I don't know what came over me.

You and Bob deserve to have some fun.

And I know how much you've been dying
to see those Mayan ruins.

You honestly feel that way?

I do.

And I promise, you won't have to worry
about me for the rest of the trip.

[tense orchestral music plays]

Yeah, hi.

I was wondering if you had any more room
on today's flight back to Boston.

Yeah,
I was thinking about ending my trip early.

I can change it at the airport?

Great. Thanks.
[cell phone locks]

All right, we'll be back
by late afternoon tomorrow.

I know I was talking a big game
this morning, Dad,

but I'm starting to have
second thoughts about this.

to be away for a whole day?

[Bob sighs, clears throat]

[clicks tongue] Uhâ€¦ Look, man, all right?

I know it's been rough
ever since your mom died.

But we have to keep moving.
We have to keep moving ahead.

[gentle music playing]

Plus, I think a little independence
might be good for you.

I just wish we could be independent
in closer proximity.

[chuckles softly, clicks tongue]
You got this. Bring it in.

You got this, all right?

[Claire] Good?
Yeah, he's good.

I need your tickets, please.

Oh, all right. You guys, take care.

Teddy...
I know, Mom. No alcohol.

Yes, and I was hoping
you could check in on them, please?

Yeah, Iâ€¦ I got it covered. Okay?

Okay, uh, love you.
[Kate] Love you.

[inhales sharply] All right. Have fun.
Okay, guys. See you soon.

[Teddy exhales]

You know,
you really don't have to check in on us.

Yeah, I wasn't planning on it.
[girl] Teddy!

See you tomorrow.

Hey, um, Kate! Where are you going?
Kids Club is this way.

Right. Um, yeah.

I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

but why don't you go ahead
and head over there,

and I'll meet you in a few?

I'll wait for you.

Go to the Kids Club, Jack.
That is a direct babysitter's order.

You're only three years older than me.

But I believe in a chain of command,

so I'll save you a spot
at the slime-making station.

[tense orchestral music playing]

[children chattering and laughing]

[Jack exhales]

Hello.
Are you waiting for the airport shuttle?

Yeah.

Driver just popped a tire,
so I'm taking people over in the meantime.

Okay, cool.

I'm gonna take a little shortcut.
Should get us there in half the time.

Sounds great.
[golf cart engine revs]

[birds calling]

So, I take it by the early checkout,
your vacation isn't going so well.

Ugh, it's complicated. My mom and...

Say no more.

My family was a real drag, too.

Ran away from that nightmare
a couple years ago.

Right around your age.

I just thought it was best for everybody
if I wasn't even here.

They can have their new little family
without me.

Kate!

Are you running away?

You're supposed to be watching me.
[device beeping]

don't take this personally or anythingâ€¦

[wormhole whooshing]
[suspenseful orchestral music playing]

What is that?

Looks like a wor...

Have a nice trip.

[tires screech]

[Jack and Kate screaming]

[wormhole whooshing]
[Jack and Kate continue screaming]

[both grunt]

[wind whipping]
[Kate gasps]

Ah.


I don't think we're in Mexico anymore.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure
there aren't any glaciers

in a 10,000-mile radius
of theÂ YucatÃ¡n Peninsula. [sighs]

[Kate exhales]

[majestic orchestral music playing]


He heard me.

I should've brought my puffy jacket.

We're gonna freeze to death out here.

Don't worry, Jack. It's gonna be okay.

He'll come for usâ€¦ I hope.

As you can see,

[in English] What in the world?

[elves chattering in Elvish]

[elves grunt]

{\an8}[in Elvish]

[in English] What's happening?
[Santa] Outside the veil, the ice pack.


Oh, dear.

Jojo, start up some hot chocolate.
[Jojo] Uh-huh.

And, Hugg, put in some thistle berry,
jitterbug juice,

and Cornish pixie dandruff.

[elves grunt]

[bottle pops open]

[Mrs. Claus sighs]
[Santa exhales]

[both grunting]

{\an8}[in Elvish]

Mm!
[Hugg grunts]

Mm-mm!

[speaking Elvish]

[in English] Good, good. Enjoy.

Drink.
[Kate sips]

[inhales sharply]

[Santa clicks tongue]
[chimes jingle]

There you go. [sighs]

You're gonna be all right, Kate.

How do you know who I am?

Oh, everyone knows
who you are around here.

We've all watched the tape
of your little Christmas adventures

from two years ago.

Are you Mrs. Claus?

That's me.

So, does that meanâ€¦?

[bright orchestral music plays]

Santa!


You feeling all right?
Yeah, I feel fine, butâ€¦

Did we just crash through a kaleidoscope?
There were so many different colors.

Oh, no. That was just us
coming back through the Veil of Borealis.

You see, we live under its shield here.

Uh, it keeps us hidden and protected
from the outside world.

how in the name of all things sacred

did you end up
in the middle of the North Pole?

Wait, you didn't bring me here?
No, I didn't bring you here.

You're supposed to be in Cancun,
if I'm not mistaken.

[Mrs. Claus] Drink.

[Jack sips]
[chimes jingle]

There you go,Â sweetie. Do you feel better?

Yeah. I feelâ€¦ really good.

That's some hot chocolate.

My special recipe.

You're just lucky
I was out there hunting Jola the Yule Cat.

Otherwise, I never would have seen you.

But I thought this was,
like, part of your plan.

You know, to grant my Christmas wish.

Umâ€¦

[quietly] The electric scooter?
No, not the... [scoffs]

I'm talking about the wish. You knowâ€¦


Yes. Wow, the other wish. Mm-hmm.

Yeah. Well, I figured it was a stretch,
so I took matters into my own hands,

and I was on my way to the airport
when our shuttle fell into this wormhole.

Wormhole?

Hmm.

Mina.
[Mina] Yeah?

{\an8}[in Elvish]


[Mrs. Claus chuckles]
[Jack sighs]

[in English]
This doesn't look like Kids Club.


[Hugg screams]

[grumbles]
What is that thing?

His name is Hugg, and he's an elf.

An elf?
An elf.

[bells ring]
[reindeer snorts]


So, are thoseâ€¦?
[Mrs. Claus] Mm-hmm.

And are youâ€¦?

Uh-huh.

Then where'sâ€¦?

[bright orchestral music plays]

Welcome to the North Pole, Jack.

Are you reallyâ€¦?
I am.

Uh-uh. No way. I must be dreaming.

Oh, you're not dreaming, Jack.
You're in Santa's Village.

The real one.

[bright orchestral music swells]

Nick,
I bet the children would like a tour.

Of the village? A tour?
Of course! Would you?

Are you kidding?
I mean, that would be amazing.

Yeah.

Well, then, we'll have to get you
into some warm clothes first.

[chimes jingle]
[whooshing]

Wow! Oh.

This is so cool.
[chuckles] Yeah.

[bright orchestral music continues]
[train whistle blows]

[elves chattering and laughing]

[choir singing]
<i>â™ª 'Tis the season to be jolly â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fa-la-la-la-laâ€¦ â™ª</i>

over a million elves.

Now, if you combine Amazon,
FedEx, the postal service, and UPS

with every manufacturing company
in the world,

and they quadrupled their output
for an entire year,

well, you just might be getting close
to what we can accomplish

here in Santa's Village in a single day.

So, where's your workshop?


Really?
[laughs] Yes.

Well, we have over 300,000 shops
here in the village.

And each and every one
designed by Mrs. Claus.

Wellâ€¦

{\an8}[gasps, in Elvish]

[in English] If she designed this place,

I think it should be called
"Mrs. Claus's Village."

Me too.
Why, Iâ€¦ I never thought of that.

Of course he didn't.
[Santa] Uhâ€¦

Ah, I mean, I did discover it,
and the elves built it,

but, I don't know,

it's been called Santa's Village
for over 1,000 years,

itâ€¦ it might be time for a change.

{\an8}[elf, in Elvish]

{\an8}- [in English] Look who's a movie star.
[elf, in Elvish]

[in English] Come on. Let's go.
I wanna show you something.

You're gonna love it.
Aha! [cackles]

[gasps] Whoa!
[chuckles]

[toy train whistle blows]
[chuckling] Kate! Hello!

[elves laughing and chattering]

[machinery whirring]
[elf 1 exclaims]


{\an8}[in Elvish]

[chime dings]

[elves clamoring wildly]
[pieces clattering]

[Santa chuckles]

[elves continue clamoring]
[pieces clicking into place]

[elves exclaim, laugh]

[in English] That's us.
That's awesome!

Katie Cat, Jack, check this out.


[elves chattering in Elvish]


I've been known to code a few in my time.

[laser blasts]
[game sound effects overlapping]

[dance music playing on speakers]

[singing to beat]
[game console chiming]

Nick.
[Santa] Hmm?

What should we show them next?

[both] Candy canes!
Kids!

[elves chattering in Elvish]

[Santa chuckles]

[elves laughing]

[bell chimes]

Whoa!

[majestic orchestral music playing]

[Jack sighs]
Look up there.

[elf 2 speaking Elvish]
[elf 3 chuckles, grunts]


[elves chattering]

[elf 4] Mm.
[machinery squeaking]

[elf 4 smacks lips] Mm!

[elf 5] Ah.

[elf 6] Hmm?
[elf 7] Ah?

[Bjorn munching] Mm-mm!


Enough to stuff billions
of stockings every year.

[Jack chuckles softly]

[elf 6] Mm.
[Bjorn munches]

[Mrs. Claus] Bjorn!
[gasps]

{\an8}[in Elvish]


[belches]
Ugh!

[elf 8 and elf 9] Bjorn!

[elves chattering]

[Santa, in English] Oh, now, Kate,
I think you might recognize this place.

[Kate] Is that the Hall of Letters?
[Santa] Uh-huh.

You've been here before?

but never out here.


There's a lot of things
I haven't told you, Jack.

[Jack sighs]
[Kate chuckles]

What is that?

That is the Christmas Star.

[majestic music playing]

[Mrs. Claus]
It powers up the entire village.

I devised a way to connect
the light from the Star of Bethlehem

to the borealis,
and that's what creates the veil.

And Santa is the only one who knows
how to get in and out of the veil safely.

Wait. The light inside the star is
from the real Star of Bethlehem?

Tiny sliver of it.

Just as bright and powerful
as the day the elves gave it to me

almost 1,700 years ago.

1,700 years ago?
[Santa] Mm-hmm.

You're that old?

Mm-hmm. You see, time stands still
here in the North Pole, Jack.

That's why you don't age.

[blasting]
What was that?

[laughs]
That's the cannons.

Cannons?
Yeah, it's okay, Jack.

[cannons blast]

[Mrs. Claus] The veil keeps everyone
and everything

from getting into the North Pole,
including snow,

so the elves have to pipe it in
from the outside. Look.

[elves chattering]
[majestic music continues playing]

[Santa chuckles]
[Jack] Wow.

It looks like we're in a giant snow globe.

Yeah.

{\an8}[in Elvish]

[in English] What?
Come on, Jack.

[elves laughing and cheering]

Ah, Nick, look at them.
They're having the time of their lives.

[chuckles] Yes, they are.Â And so are you.
[chuckles, sighs]

Real children.

[inhales sharply] It's just been so long.


[sighs] I'll be sad to see them leave.
[Santa] Mm.

[clicks tongue]
Well, we can't send them home

on an empty stomach.

Certainly not.
That would be rude.

Oh, very unthoughtful.
We can't have that.

No. No. Well, then it's decided.

They'll come for dinner,
and then you'll take them back.

Exactly what I was thinking.

And I have to prepare.
Oh, I have to prepare.

Jojo.
[Jojo] Uh-huh?

I need corn for popping.
[Jojo repeats]

Uh, three French hens,

a partridge, a pear, and figgy pudding!

[elf] Ooh, figgy pudding.
[elves chatter]

[fire crackling]
[elf] Ah.

[Santa] All right.
[elf squeaks, grunts]


Wow!

This is dinner?
Uh-huh.

executive chef, Mrs. Claus.

Well, a little something
I whipped up last minute.

[both chuckle]
Okay, let's sit down.

You're over here, Kate. [clears throat]
[Jack] I don't know, Mrs. Claus.

My dad's really strict

about me eating my protein and vegetables
before I have dessert.

Well, as he should be,
but this isn't dessert.

It's not?

No, everything on this table
is super healthy for you.

How is that possible?

Well, I've created some new recipes.

Recipes that make all the food you hate

look and taste like all the food you love.

[Santa chuckles]
Wow.

Would you like some broccoli?

[Jack gasps]

[clock chiming]

[Jack exhales]

This is the most delicious thing
I've ever tasted!

All right!
[Santa laughs]

Well, now, don't miss
the lima beans and carrots.

Wow!

Soâ€¦


About how you got here.

All this business
about coming through a wormhole.

It's true.
It was just like on your sleigh.

Only, instead of a sleigh,
it was a golf cart.


[Mrs. Claus] Nick?
Hmm?

I have a feeling this has something to do
with Kate being a True Believer.


Yeah. What if it means
that I'm supposed to live here

with you guys in the North Pole?

[spits, coughs] Excuse me?

Come on, Santa. I already speak Elvish,
I've been on the big ride,

and I could bring a fresh perspective
to the whole operation.

When did this turn into a job interview?


Anything would be better than going home
to my mom and her boyfriend.

I'm sitting right here, you know.

[Kate sighs]

I'm sure your mother loves you very much.

More than you can ever imagine.

I don't know, Mrs. Claus.

You should've seen how fast she ditched me
for those stupid Mayan ruins.


And besides, our parents
aren't even gonna get back to the resort

until tomorrow afternoon.


Come on, Santa, let us stay.
Even just for a little bit?

Hmm. Umâ€¦ [smacks lips]

Mrs. Claus?

[takes a deep breath] Well, it would be
so nice having children hereâ€¦

If only just for one night. [sighs]

[gentle orchestral music playing]

Please, Santa. Let us stay.
We'll be good. I promise.

Just for one night. Please?
[Jack] Come on.

Well, I don'tâ€¦
I don't see the harm in it, but, uhâ€¦

Oh, why not? Absolutely.
[Kate and Jack] Yes!

Thank you, Santa.
[sighs]

But then first thing in the morning,
it's right back to Cancun, huh?

Mrs. Claus's Village
is the best place on earth!

Oh! [laughs]

[chuckles, grunts]

[Mina grunting and straining]

this is what you get for spying on me.

bring me the rest of my toys.

[Speck straining]

[grunts, panting]


You know what to do.

[robot beeps]
[Belsnickel chuckles softly]

[robot whirring]

In a few hours, this entire village
will be nothing but a distant memory.

[menacing orchestral music plays]

[Mrs. Claus] Good night, sweet Jack.

[kisses]
Good night, Mrs. Claus.

Sleep tight.

Oh!

Sweetheart, sleep tight. [kisses]


<i>The Christmas Chronicles</i>?

Jack!
[gasps]

I wouldn't touch those if I were you.
They look pretty rare.

[Mrs. Claus] Yes, they are very rare.
Oh, they're one of a kind, actually.

[chuckles softly, sighs]
Would you like to hear a bedtime story?

Man, that would be awesome!
That'd be amazing.

Oh, okay.
[Santa chuckles]

[gentle orchestral music plays]
Well, here. Come on, follow me.

Well, have a cozy winter's nap, children.

Good night, Santa.

Sweet dreams.

Good night, Santa Claus.
You know, you can just call him Santa.

[all chuckle]

[Mrs. Claus sighs]
All right, now. Here we go.

[pages rustle]

[Mrs. Claus] So, yeah. Okay.


Very,

very closely.

[wind blows]
[Mrs. Claus] This is where it all began.

<i>- Back in 312 AD.</i>
[gentle flute music playing]

[Mrs. Claus] <i>Santa was living</i>
<i>in Asia Minor. Today, it's called Turkey.</i>

[coins jingling]

[Mrs. Claus]
<i>Santa was known as Saint Nicholas.</i>

[Santa chuckles]

[Mrs. Claus]Â <i>He was a bishop</i>
<i>who discovered the joy of giving.</i>

[crickets chirping]
[Santa grunts]

[Mrs. Claus]
<i>Became something of a local hero.</i>

<i>And his legend spread far and wide,
eventually reaching theÂ Forest Elves.</i>

Wait, you mean
there are different kinds of elves?

Oh, of course. They're an ancient species
of very magical and wild creatures.

For centuries, they were hunted
for their magical powers,

<i>and then they were captured by humans
to the brink of extinction.</i>

[elves clamoring in Elvish]
[hunters cackling]

{\an8}[in Elvish]

[sighs, in English] That's awful.

Oh, it was.


there was a prophecy

about a man
who would be king of the elves,

who would, one day, lead them to safety.

[wind whistling]

[Mrs. Claus]Â Their leader, Hakan,
knew that Saint Nicholas was the only one

<i>who could channel
the Star of Bethlehem's power.</i>

<i>From that day forward,</i>

<i>they no longer referred to him
as Saint Nicholas.</i>

<i>- They called him Santa Claus.</i>
[elves murmuring]

[Mrs. Claus] <i>And he led the elves</i>
<i>on a mystical journey</i>

<i>to an unknown land,
where Christmas would truly endure.</i>


[Mrs. Claus chuckles] <i>Yes.</i>

[elves chatter]

Weird. That one elf,

he looks kinda familiar.

Yeah.

[Mrs. Claus] Hmm.

Belsnickel.


[chimes jingle]

[book whooshes]

[both chuckle] Whoa!


Nowâ€¦ [sighs]

{\an8}Belsnickel was a precocious
and brilliant elf

who was very popular here in the village.

<i>I taught him the art
of magical potion-making,</i>

<i>and Santa taught him the art of invention.</i>

[speaking Elvish]
[Belsnickel] Ooh.

[electricity pops]
[Belsnickel groans]

[toy clicks]
[chuckles, in English] Hey. Okay.

[piece dings]
[Santa] Uh-huh.

[toy whirring]

[Santa laughs]
Wow.

[Santa sighs]

Oh.

[Mrs. Claus]
<i>We had so many good times together.</i>

<i>Santa and I grew
to love him very, very much.</i>

But, by the time Belsnickel
became a teenager, everything changed.

The spirit of Christmas
had grown around the world.

Santa had less time for Belsnickel,

so Belsnickel became resentful
of Santa, and more rebellious.

Until, one day, he broke the Elves' Code.

What's the Elves' Code?

Ego, lying, viciousness,

envy, and selfishness.

And if an elf commits
every single one of those transgressions,

they become cursed.

[clicks tongue]
And Belsnickel, well, he broke all five.

[wind whistles]

[Mrs. Claus] He became a very naughty boy.

[elves chattering]
[Fleck humming]

[Belsnickel blows]

[chuckles]
[Fleck grunts]

[whoopee cushion blows]

Ew!

{\an8}[in Elvish]

Blech!
[all laughing]

[Belsnickel jeers]
[Fleck whines]

[Mrs. Claus, in English]
<i>And he kept getting naughtierâ€¦</i>

[glass shatters]

[Bjorn hums, laughs]


[grunts, gasps]

[grunts, moans]

<i>â€¦and naughtier.</i>

{\an8}[in Elvish]

[both chuckle]
[Jojo] Mm-hmm.

[in English] Enjoy.
Very nice. Hmm.

Oh.

[scoffs]
[Belsnickel laughs]


Belsnickel! What is this?
[Belsnickel] Ah.

I build all the best toys around here.
It's about time I get some of the credit.

[Santa sighs]

[Mrs. Claus]
<i>And when he broke the final transgression,</i>

<i>Belsnickel was stripped
of the joy of being an elf.</i>

[paint sprays]
Belsnickel!

What are you doing?

[Belsnickel grunts]
[Santa] Why would you do that?

Because you care more
about children all over the world

than you care about me.

[Mrs. Claus] <i>And with that, he transformed</i>
<i>into the thing he despised the most,</i>

<i>a human.</i>

[Belsnickel groans] Ah!


Ah! Oh!

[gasps, groans]

[continues grunting]

[voice grows deeper] Oh, oh! Ah!

[groans, breathing shakily]


[Mrs. Claus]
<i>Clouded by anger and humiliationâ€¦</i>

No, no, no! Wait, wait!
Belsnickel, come back!

<i>â€¦Belsnickel ran away from the villageâ€¦</i>

Never to return.

[Jack sighs]

He was a naughty little elfâ€¦
but I miss him.

Okay.

That's about enough for tonight.

We get up at the crack of dawn
around here.

Good night, Mrs. Claus.

Good night, Mrs. Claus.
Good night, children.

[Jack sighs]

[Speck cackles]
Ah, this is gonna be fun.

Now, only one small scoop
into each cannon.

Nick.

It's him.

[Santa sighs]

The star!

[star continues chiming]
[Belsnickel panting]



Missing something?

You've played a lot of nasty tricks
in your time, Belsnickel,

but sending Jola into the stables?


So, he scared the reindeer,
and they ran off into the forest.

He attacked Dasher!

That wasn't supposed to happen.
[Santa] Well, it did.

Hey, is that him?
[Santa] She's very badly wounded.

[Belsnickel sighs]
Soâ€¦ it <i>was</i> you.

Hello, Mrs. Claus.

My apologies for any inconvenience.

Inconvenience?

Dasher is fighting for her life!

Belsnickel, how could you?

That's Belsnickelâ€¦

From the story.

[Santa] Mm-hmm.
I knew I recognized him.

That's the guy who drove the shuttle
back in Cancun.

[Jack] Yeah.
Yep.

And I gotta thank you, Kate,
because, without you,

I never could have got
back inside Santa's Village.

That's Mrs. Claus's Village to you!

That'sâ€¦ That's not official.

this little family reunion's been sweet,

but it's time for me to leave.

Not until that star is back on the tree.

Agreed, but not this tree.

This star's for my tree
back at the South Pole.

Ooh, it's gonna be the shiz.
I am starting a new village.

I can see it now. "Belsnickel's Village."

There's gonna be another village?
[Belsnickel] You bet there is.

And I'm gonna round up
my own band of elves,

and I'm gonna invent my own stuff,
really cool stuff,

that will make everybody forget
that the North Pole

and Santa Claus ever existed.

Pout, pout, pout!

Whatever.

I am taking the star to the South Pole
so I can stop aging and buy some time

to figure out a way
to break this awful curse.

What's so bad about being human?

Humans suck!

Elves rule.

And I am tired of being a human!

Belsnickel, there's only one way
to break the curse,

and that's for you
to come back home to the village

and embrace your family.

I know that deep down insideâ€¦

It's what you want.

[gentle orchestral music plays]

Bah, humbug!


[chimes jingle]
Hi. Thank you.

[device beeps, whirs]

[star whooshes]

How do you like my new gravity glove?


But it's no match for real magic.
[chimes jingle]

[glove whirs]
Give it up, Bels.


The only thing you ever cared about
was your stupid holiday.

That stupid holiday

makes billions of people
feel love and happiness.

Well, I'm about to change all of that.

Change, ha!

You couldn't handle
any of the little changes

that were going on around here,
so you ran away.

Because you spend every hour of every year
getting ready for one lousy day.

A day that brings joy
to children all over the world,

and that will never change.

[Santa and Belsnickel grunting]

Oh!

Belsnickel, stop!

[Santa exhales]
Belsnickel, what have you done?

[Belsnickel breathing shakily]

[glove beeps]
[drone blades whirring]


This isâ€¦ [gasps]

This is bad.

Without the star,

the North Pole, the village,
Christmas itself is doomed!

Like, for this year?

Like, forever.

You're right. This is bad.

But we can't let that happen.

Christmas must endure.

Elf Bane.
Oh, dear!

The elves have been poisoned by Elf Bane.

It drives them insane.
They become reckless, dangerous maniacs.

[Mrs. Claus] Okay.


[panting] Okay.
[reindeer grunting]

[door closes]

[chimes jingle]

[Dasher bellowing weakly]

[Mrs. Claus sighs]
Oh, Dash.

[Dasher breathing heavily]

Can you heal her?

I'll try my best.

I also have to find a cure for Elf Bane.

And I need to get to Turkey.
Turkey?

I need to find Hakan and the Forest Elves.

They're the ones that can build
a new star for me to reignite.

But, Nick, you've never flown
with only seven reindeer.

I know, I know.
And you can't work on Dasher

and find a cure for Elf Bane by yourself.

Jack will help me.

He will?

Should I stay here, too?

No, no, I need you to come with me.

Why?

Well, with only seven, I'm not even sure
we can get the sleigh off the ground.

I'm gonna need
all the help I can get, Kate.

Hurry back.


[elves yelping]

[reindeer grunting]

all the presents you need to deliver?

Christmas is only three days away.

Without Dasher, how are we...
Like I said, it's a challenge.

But, you see, they'reâ€¦ they're improving.

As long as their Christmas Spirit
stays high, we should be okay. [grunts]

I'm so sorry, Santa.
If I hadn't have just...

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

This is not your fault, Katie Cat.

Believe me, that tricky little elf
was gonna find his way

into the village one way or another.

Well, what's he gonna do now?

Oh, he's probably trying to figure out
some way to beat us to Turkey.

But why?
Well, to stop me from getting a new star.

That's not gonna happen.

Because he's not taking
one thing into consideration.

What's that?

He can't possibly get there
as fast as we can,

no matter what he does.

[shouts in Elvish]
[reins crack]

You underestimate me, old man,
just like you always do. [scoffs]

[wind whipping]
[Belsnickel grunts]

[elves clamoring and laughing wildly]

to get the elves back to normal.


Elf, elf fluâ€¦

Elf-binâ€¦

Here it is, Elf Bane.

Oh, dear.
What?

It only has one known cure.

"Levande Root"?
[Mrs. Claus] It's a rare Arctic flower.

And there's only one place
that it grows around here.

Okay. Now, follow this path

through the forest,
and it will lead you to theÂ Levande Root.

Okay, but you're coming with me, right?

[Dasher bellows, breathing weakly]


No, I need to stay here with Dasher.

But, Mrs. Claus,
isn't it kinda dangerous out there?

It can be, but that's true of any place.

You can do this, Jack.

I won't let anything happen to you.

I'll be watching you the entire time.

And I'm arming youâ€¦

With these.

You're arming me with cookies?

Well, they're not just any old cookies.

Okay, the gingerbread man cookie explodes

when you throw it,

and the snowman cookie gives you courage.


We don't have a moment to lose.

Wait. Hold on.

[sighs] Okay.

[takes a deep breath]
It's pretty cold out there.

What if I get frostbite?

Oh, don't worry about frostbite.

I'm an expert
at reattaching fingers and toes.

[Jack gasps]
Now, hurry.

Jack!

[gentle orchestral music playing]
Be my hero.

My mom used to say
the same thing to me. [sighs]

Okay. It's hero time.

This is not what I expected Turkey
to look like at all.

Ah, you're on hallowed ground here, Kate.

Two, three hundred years old?

They've never seen me. [chuckles]

I haven't been back here in,

maybe 500 years. [chuckles]

Five hundred and twenty-two,

Hakan. [clicks tongue]

You look well and wise.

You as well, Nicholas.

Who's your friend?

{\an8}[in Elvish]

[in English] Hmm.
Your Elvish is impressive.

So is your English.

Thank you.

So, what brings you both here?

Belsnickel.
Oh. What's he done now?

Destroyed the Christmas Star.

Well, we can build a new container.

But only you, Nicholas,

Christmas Eve.

It's not good.

Why not?

Well, during the holidays,

airports have some of the lowest
Christmas Spirit in the world.

Right now, this one's atâ€¦

[watch ticking]

â€¦7% and dropping.

Well, what happens
if Christmas Spirit gets down to zero?

The reindeer won't be able to fly at all.
Now, look at them. They're exhausted.

All right. Hold on tight.
Okay, I'm gonna have to bring her down.

We just opened a tear
in the fabric of time.

Those wormholes won't stay open for long.
How much time do we have?

Uh, 11, 12 minutes, at the most.

Which means
if we don't get Christmas Spirit up soonâ€¦

We're stuck here forever.

[device beeping]

Bingo!
There's the guilty culprit, right here.

What is it?
Ah, some kind of time twister.

Looks like Belsnickel figured out
a rudimentary form of time travel.

[chuckles] You gotta admire his work.

But, as usual, it's also got
his signature shoddy craftsmanship.


You need to find a power source for that.

Now, that's good, that's good.
[man on PA] <i>Oh.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>I have been informed that this flight
has been delayed for an hour.</i>

<i>Sorry about this delay.</i>

I think I found out
what this thing runs on.

Triple-A batteries.

Only Belsnickel could power
a time machine with triple-As.

All right, let's see what I've got here.

[clears throat, sighs] Yeah. There we go.

These are expired.
What?


[Kate sighs]
[Santa grunts]

The gift shop. They'll have some there.
Yeah. Good thinking. All right.

You go get 'em and then meet me
right back here. All right?


Let's see what we have to play with here.

[woman on PA] <i>Attention on the concourse.</i>

<i>A new departure timeâ€¦</i>

Here.

[register whirring]
Three dollars, please.

Here you go. Keep the change.

Is this some kind of joke?
[Kate] Hmm?

Is this Monopolymoney?

No, that's real.

I've ever seen.

It says 2020.
Oh.

I bet they won't even be
using paper money in 30 years.

Um, right. Um, my mistake. Sorry.
Hey, you gotta pay for those batteries.

What's goin' on here, young lady?

Where are your parents?

Oh, they'reâ€¦
they're cool with me traveling alone.

Hmm. Can I see your boarding pass, please?

You know what? I must have dropped it
over there. Uh, I'll go get it.

You know what? Hey!
Why don't you come with me?

What? No, please.
Look, kid, you got no ticket, no parents.

For all I know, you could be a runaway.
But I'm not aâ€¦ Not exactly.

You know what?

Yeah, I'll get right on that.

[chuckles]

[gate agent] I'm sorry, everyone.
I don't have good news.

All flights have been canceled!

What? Five minutes ago,
you said there'd be a 30-minute delay.

And now that flight has been canceled.

So you're telling me
you didn't know five minutes ago

that it was a cancellation
and not a delay?

I <i>am </i>telling you.

Listen, we can offer you
a complimentary hotel room for the night.

I don't want a free hotel room!

I want a flight to Chicago, right now!

Well, what we need is, uhâ€¦

Well, it's real simple.

All we need is, uhâ€¦

Perhaps I should explain a little further.

[crowd cheering]

{\an8}[music continues in distance, fades]

[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
[indistinct chatter]

[chuckles softly] Hey, Grinch.

Don't look so down in the dumps.
Christmas is tomorrow,Â after all.

I wouldn't be so sure of that.

Sometimes, I just don't get people.

A little snag in their plans,
and suddenly, the sky is falling.

Santa will find a way
to make it all work out. He always does.

For good little boys and girls.

I'm starting to wonder
if I fall into the other category.


I know another True Believer
when I see one.

Wait, you know about True Believers?

I come from a long line of them.

That's why I know that,
by this time tomorrow,

I'm gonna be in Miami.

Nothing better than spending Christmas
on the beach,Â if you ask me.

Sounds like you'd get along
with the rest of my family.

Christmas in the tropics
just isn't for me. [sighs]

Oh, don't get me wrong.

I love drinking hot cocoa by the fire,
ice skating, all that good stuff.

But my grandparents live in Florida,
and they're too old to travel.

And who knows how many more Christmases
I'm gonna spend with them, you know?

That's really sweet of you.

It's like my mom always says,

"Christmas isn't about where you are
but who you're with."

What's wrong?
Nothing. It's justâ€¦


Hey, it's okay.
You couldn't have done anything that bad.

Oh, I ran away and probably broke up
my mom's engagement.

Okay, that's bad. [chuckles slightly]

But this guy your mom's with,
he must be pretty horrible.

No, Bob's a really great guy.
And he makes her so happy.

Okay. So now I'm really confused.

It's just, it's only been
a couple years since myâ€¦ my dadâ€¦

And, well, if my mom marries Bob,
then it meansâ€¦

Your dad is really gone.

Yeah. Even though he's not here anymore,

it still feels like he's with us,
you know?

Andâ€¦ I just really wanted
to say goodbye to him.

And I guess I felt so sad about it,

I wanted everyone else
to feel the same way I did.

But the truth is, now,

I'd do anything
to spend Christmas with them.

Mom, Teddy, and, yeah, even Bob.

Well, we'll just have to make that happen,
won't we?

[chuckles]
[Kate chuckles softly]

[Kate] How's it going?
Almost there.

[Kate] Hurry up.

You're all gonna be home for Christmas!

[sighs] That was amazing.
Did you get 'em?

[clears throat]
What?

The batteries.

Oh, yeah.

Ah, attagirl! Way to go, Kate.

Oh, yeah, Santa.
I want you to meet someone.

This isâ€¦ I didn't get your name.

It's Doug.

Pierce.
[device whirs]

[beeping]
[Santa chuckles]

That's right. [chuckles]

Wait. Your name is Doug Pierce?

That's me, but how did you know myâ€¦

[Santa exhales, clears throat]

Is he really Santa?
Just... Wait. Okay.

You're Doug Pierce.

Are you from Lowell, Massachusetts?

Yeah, but I never told you
where I was from.

["O Christmas Tree" playing]
So, you're myâ€¦

You're myâ€¦

Santa, is he myâ€¦ myâ€¦?

I hate to cut this short, kids,
but we need to get going, Kate.

[takes a deep breath] Time to say goodbye.


Excuse me?

I mean, Doug.

Think you need
to let Doug up for some air, Katie Cat.

Thank you for everything.

Yeah, well,
a Pierce always sees it through.

[chuckles softly] Yes, we do.

Spoken like a True Believer.

Kate!

Merry Christmas, Doug.




From now on, always bring
a video camera wherever you go.

[Mrs. Claus] Nowâ€¦

There's only one way
to administer this to every elf.

The cannons.

Exactly. Think you can do it?

I got this, Mrs. C.

Oh, Jack, I can't send you out there
alone without protection.

More cookies?

No cookies are gonna stop
thousands of maniacal elves.

Okay? So, follow me.

something much stronger.

[dramatic orchestral music playing]


[sleigh whooshing]
[reindeer grunt]

[meter whirs, dings]


All right, ladies.
This is our last chance to get back.

But, Santa, when we do get back,

how're we gonna get the star
from Belsnickel?

I mean, he's probably already
at the South Pole.

Well, that's a very good point.
Unless, of course, we set this little baby

to 15 seconds
after Belsnickel sent us into the past.

Ah. Huh?

You'll see.

[device whirs, beeping]

[sleigh whooshes]
[wormhole crackles]

Bon voyage! Whoo-hoo!
[wormhole whooshes]

You feel that, everybody?
That's a world without Santa Claus.

I was just gonna disappear, did you?

I wasâ€¦ I wasâ€¦ I was gonna
veer off, at the very last second.

We were just playing
a little game of chicken.

Exactly! Game of chicken.

[chuckles]
Okay. All right, that's enough.

Nick, sometimes I think you actually enjoy
these little dangerous escapades.


Well, Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ Eh.

Great job with the cannons, Jack.


but you'll never win the war.

[Santa sighs]

I'll find another way
to get back in the village.

I'll come back one day,

and you'll all be in
for the fight of your life.

I don't really think
you mean that, Belsnickel.

But if you do, I'll be ready. [chuckles]

But, uh, until thenâ€¦

There's something I want you to have.

A little gift.
[Belsnickel] Let me guess.

Coal? You're so predictable.

[gentle orchestral music playing]

The first toyâ€¦

That we built together.

[Santa chuckles softly] Mm-hmm.

You kept it?


Helped remind me
of what an amazing elf you are.

You mean, the elf I was.

He's still in there.
You just need to believe it.

[Belsnickel breathing shakily]

[chimes jingle]

[toy whirring]

[Belsnickel panting softly]

[letters chiming]

[sighs, voice breaking]
We had some good times.

But I'll never be that elf again.

Of course you will.


You don't know what this feels like.

Belsnickel, you don't need to be an elf

to realize that running away
doesn't solve all your problems.

And sometimes,

we need to listen
to the ones that we love the most.

Because at the end of the day,

your family are the only ones
in the whole world

who really understand you.

They're the only ones that will always
be there for you, no matter what.

Someone really cool once told me

that Christmas isn't about where you are
but who you're with.

We love you, Belsnickel.

Always have, Bels.


[bells tolling]

[breathing heavily]

I officially declareâ€¦

Order has been restored to the North Pole!

[all cheering]

[elves chattering and laughing]

Now, Dasher,
are you sure you're ready for this trip?

[Dasher grunts]

If you say so.

All right. Last sleigh to Cancun.

All aboard.
[Jack gasps] Oh, my God.

This is probably gonna be
my first and only trip in the sleigh.

Can I sit up front, Santa?
Well, you can't drive from the back.

What?
[laughs] Yeah.

Now, this puppy's got some serious jump.
You think you can handle it?

Well, yeah!
All right. Jump in and get the reins.

There you go. [grunts]

Hey, Santa?
[Santa exhales]

I just wanted to say thank you.

For what?

For letting me say goodbye to my dad.

Now, Kate, that was purely coincidental.


Jump in. [chuckles]

Children! Children!

you get a little peckish on the ride.

What's in these?

Um, eggs, butter, flour, sugar.

No. What kinda magic is in them?

I mean, when I ate one in the forest,
I lost all my fears.

The snowman cookie made me feel stronger.

Well, only the gingerbread man
had magic ingredients.

The snowman didn't have any.

But wait.

So, that meansâ€¦

The hero was always inside you.


Ohâ€¦ you will from time to time,
and that's as it should be.

[Jack sighs]


[both] Merry Christmas, Mrs. Claus.
Merry Christmas.

[grunts] Hey, guys.
[Kate] Yeah?

One last thing.

[Jack] What's that?
Stay away from strangers in golf carts.

[all laugh]
Will do.

{\an8}[in Elvish]

[doors open]
[in English] Nick.

Hurry back.

[blows kiss]

[chuckles softly]
Hit it, Jack!

Here goes. On, Dasher! On, Dancer!
On, Prancer! On, Vixen!

[reins crack]
Goodbye, children!

[dramatic orchestral music playing]


That's it. That's it.
Now, pull 'em back! Pull 'em!

[Jack shouting in Elvish]
Harder!

[shouts in Elvish]
[laughing] Not bad. Not bad at all, Jack!

All right, kids. We're here.

Ready to jump?

Jump?

All the way down there?

[Santa] Mm-hmm.
Trust me, Jack. You'll be fine.

I don't know, Kate.
I fought a village of crazy elves,

but this seems kinda dangerous,
if you ask me.

You'll be okay. I promise.


Yeah?

Will we ever see you again?

Not if he can help it.

We did it again.

Yes, we did.

Uhâ€¦

Just one thing, Katie Cat.

I know, Santa. I'll be good.

[chimes jingle]



[soaring orchestral music playing]

On, Dasher!
[Dasher grunts]


You've gotta be kidding me.

[wormhole whooshes]

[chuckles softly]

Looks like you guys had a visit
from our old friend.

[Kate chuckles]
[chimes jingle]

Was it as good as last time?

Well, let me put it this way.

I met Mrs. Claus,

and I helped save Christmas
with Dad when he was 13.

Areâ€¦ Are you serio... No way.

Yes way.
[chuckles]

Yeah, well, I climbed a glacier
and fought off a Yule cat,

so I'm kind of a big deal
at the North Pole now.

Is that right?
[Jack] Yeah.

Me and Mrs. Claus are like this.

Wow. You guys gotta tell me everything,

but Bob and Mom are actually
waiting for us, so we gotta go.

Come on.

When I last saw you,
you were heading to Kids Club.

How'd you get
from there onto Santa's sleigh?

You know, that was a life-changing trip.

It was.
[Bob] Mm.

[Claire chuckles]
Mm! Ah, there's my little man.

[Jack] Dad!
Come on! What?

I'm so happy to see you, honey!
[Bob] That's my main man!

Ah, I missed you so much!
Yeah!

I missed you, too.
[Claire sighs]

Both of you.

[gentle orchestral music playing]

Really?
Ah.

Yeah.

[Jack sighs]


Kate, I want you to know
I really care for your mother.

And I hope
that me and you can continue to bond.

I know nothing happens overnight.

One day at a time, right?

One day at a time.

You know, guys, I was thinking,
maybe tonightâ€¦

Maybe we should have a caroling party.

[softly] Wow!
Seriously?

Sure.

Iâ€¦ I think that's a great idea.

I love it. I'm in.
[Claire] Let's do it.
