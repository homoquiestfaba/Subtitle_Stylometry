Oh, yeah, from who?

Fuck that noise, Chris.

That shit wouldn't

Hell's yeah, I would

He's at the courts

Yeah, fuck Jason.
I hope he dies.

You wanna smoke or what?

Young wannabe gangster.

<i>Let's go, dawg!</i>

Man, you know that fool crazy.
You know he's crazy, Reg.

<i>Well, we going anyway,</i>

Gotta take a piss test

Nigga, that's why

<i>Yeah, nigga, that's why.</i>

What time is
your interview?

Like a half-hour, man.
That's why we gotta kill

Mikey, huh?

No, man.

You're right, my bad.

Right here, man.

What up, woot?

Auntie!

<i>What y'all</i>
<i>little fuckers want?</i>

<i>Mikey, is that you?</i>
Yeah, it's me.
How are you?

How do I look?

I'm here to see my uncle.
He ain't here.

I kicked
his skinny little ass
out last night.

I'll be god damned
if that coward lay
one more hand on me.

And if you see him,
tell him to come around
here one more time.

I'm gonna cut
his motherfucking
dick off, you heard me?

Damn!
Yes, ma'am.

Something went down
last night.

You think?

Take care of your
mama, Woot.

Woman: <i>Who there?</i>
It's Mikey.

Hi, Mikey.

I haven't seen you
in a while.

Y'all wanna come in?

No, I'm looking for my uncle.
Have you seen him?

Yeah, he tried to come
over last night,

but I wasn't having that.

So where he went?

Probably the Wolf Trap
or something.

Wolf Trap Motel?

<i>Everything all right?</i>

Pretty far
fucking from it.

Mikey, what's up?

Why don't you come in?

Some other time.

Bye.
<i>Yeah.</i>

That's his van.

Now let me
do the talking,
all right?

Whatever, man.

Come on, James.

I ain't going in.

Why not?
I just don't want to.

Go see, go see.

What do you got?

Reggie:
<i>I got $40</i>

And this ring.

It ain't worth shit.

<i>That's my mom's ring.</i>

So you gonna give me
the gun or what?

Why don't you just
sit down?

<i>I don't wanna sit down.</i>
You're making Jim nervous.

Sit down, man,
sit down.

<i>Will you please</i>
<i>sit down?</i>

I said I don't wanna
sit down!

I wanna get the fucking burner
so I can get the fuck
up out of here,

so quit playing games
and hand the shit over.

I hate motherfuckers
like you.

Got no respect
for your elders.

<i>You just make choices</i>

<i>without having</i>
<i>to pay the consequences.</i>

Let me tell you
something, boy.

You're going to pay.

<i>You'll pay!</i>

<i>You done?</i>

Huh?
What?

What?

The sad thing is

this whole motherfucking
beautiful country

being run by motherfucker
who are just like you.

These little...

quick trigger motherfuckers
just like you.

Just like you.

They think they bulletproof.

Huh, huh?
<i>Let him go, man!</i>

Come on, Unc,
let him go, man.

Think you're bulletproof?
You ain't bulletproof.

Ain't none of us
bulletproof.

You wake up
tomorrow morning,

your whole family and your
friends could be out there
on the street.

You could be slaughtered
right in front of you,
like Rwanda.

You know Rwanda?
Who the fuck is Rwanda, man?

Who the fuck is Rwanda?
Who is Rwanda?

You dumb motherfucker!

Mass genocide,
motherfucker!

Some evil motherfuckers
wake up one day

and decide they're just gonna
take out a whole section

of the human race.

Come up in here
wanting a gun.

Shit! No, I don't believe

I'll be giving you
no burner, man.

Hell fucking no.

My karma is already
too fucking gut shot,

butt-fucked bad man.

Ain't that right, Jim?
Get up, man.

What the fuck

this bandit up in here,
Mikey?

Look, Unc, I thought--

You thought wrong.

Does your mama know

<i>Yeah, man.</i>

Let me hold it.

<i>No, it's called</i>

<i>"Girls Gone Wild:</i>

<i>What do you all want</i>

<i>Yo, come on, man,</i>
<i>it ain't like that.</i>

Yeah, fuck it is

Look at me.

I'm tired of you fucking

Always following

I already got a fucking shadow.
You know what I'm saying, huh?

<i>Yo, J, why you</i>

<i>I'm your boy.</i>

Why am I saying this?

Yo, chill, man,

What did you do?
Walk on, that's what
you need to do!

What did I do?
Candace: Just go, Chris.

Sean's coming

So things will be
better tomorrow.

Sean and I have been homeys
since we was real little.

This one time
in kindergarten

I was out
on the playground

and I was kind of being
picked on by this dillweed.

I was kind of
being picked on
out on the playground

and Sean came over
and pushed him down

and kicked him
right in his fat face.

Kicked him right
in his fat fucking face.

He's been my best friend
ever since.

And he's got my back
for reals, you know?

<i>( knocks on window )</i>

Girl: <i>Chris.</i>
Huh?

<i>( beep )</i>
<i>Yo, Sabrina, it's Jason.</i>

<i>Stop calling me, all right?</i>

<i>And another thing,</i>
<i>do not under any circumstance</i>

<i>try to come to my sister's</i>

You'll be back?

Hey, man, I'm gonna

So whose party

Okay.
Thanks, Reggie.

Yeah, he's in the back.

Jason.

What's up, Sabrina?

Hey, Candace.

What's up?

Can I talk to you
for a second?

Yeah.

What the fuck, Sabrina?

You can't be doing this shit
in front of my girl.

I just wanted to talk.
Talk about what?

About us.
There is no us.

But what about what happened?
What about nothing,
nothing happened.

We had sex.
Yeah, we fucked.

You were my first.

That was a mistake,
all right?

We made a mistake,
that's all.

I got a girl.
You already said that.

Yeah, I know,
but this shit can't happen
between us, all right?

So just let it go.

No, Sabrina.
Jason.

No, no.

This shit ain't happening.
Jason!

I'm pregnant.

Jeez!

Nikki:
<i>Okay, I'll see you</i>
<i>in the back.</i>

You okay, 'Brina?

No.
What's going on?

I did something bad, Nikki.
What?

I slept with Jason.

You what?
Candace is gonna
kick your ass.

No, you can't tell her.
You can't tell nobody.

Sabrina,
what were you thinking?

Nikki, I love him.

Sabrina,

You're such
a fucking baby.

Nikki, no,
don't leave.

Jesus!

Oh, hi, Jenny.
God, there's so much drama

Going on right now.
You wouldn't believe it.

What?
I can't hear you.
Hello!

Why is everyone yelling?

They're scrapping out there.
Who?

Mason and your brother.
Well, break it up
or something.

I can't have the cops
come to my house.

<i>Yo, break it up.</i>
<i>Break it up!</i>

He has to be a dumbass
for fighting my idiot brother.

Yeah, I told them.

Fuck this shit, man!

<i>( gunshots )</i>

Jen-- yeah, someone just
shot off a gun.

Yeah.

I'm okay.

You coming over or not?

Well, bring mark.
He's so cute.

Nikki, you should
call the police.

Was anyone hurt?
No, but--

Well, then no police.
Nobody call the police.

Jenny, hold on.

Hold on a second.

Bonnie.

What the hell's
going on back there?

My brother got into a fight,
and Mason shot off a gun.

Is anybody dead?
No.

Good, where can
we spark this?

In the back,
in the shed.

Jenny, I gotta go.
I'm gonna smoke with Bonnie.

But come over soon
and bring Mark.

No, he won't get shot.

God, what a dumb bitch.

( crying )

Fuck that bitch.

What?
I hate that bitch.

I thought
you two were tight.
Were.

Hey, guys.

<i>Speak of the devil.</i>

What do you want?

Nikki, can we go
outside?

Anything you gotta say to me
you can say in front of her.

I'm sorry.

You ain't gotta
apologize.

And we all sisters, right?
Right.

We wouldn't do nothing
to hurt each other, right?

Right, Sabrina?
Right.

I mean, I wouldn't fuck
your brother. I just wouldn't
do that now, would I?

Right, Sabrina?
And you guys wouldn't fuck
my brother either, right?

Well, I might
fuck your brother.

He's kinda fine.

You wouldn't fuck Jason,
would you, Sabrina, huh?

Nikki--
Don't touch me, you slut.

Hey, you guys made me drop
the fucking blunt.

Look, I don't know what's
going on between y'all,

but I wanna get high,
so I'm leaving.

No, don't go.

Let's just all smoke.

But--
Smoke it, bitch.

Yeah.

I just got really
fucking high.

Me too.

We smoked something.

I wanna go home.

Can you call
my brother, please?

Chris.

Jason.

Huh?

Jason, is that you?

No, it's Chris, Jason's--
Chris.

Why does he have
to be such an asshole?

Did he hurt you?

Yeah.

What did he do?

He broke my heart.

He does that
to everybody.

I know how we can
get back at him.

How?

If you and I...

Wait, this is stupid.
No no, this is good.

No, stop.
This is dumb.

No no, this is perfect.
Don't worry.

No, stop!
No, I'm in the fucking zone!

Stop!
No no no, come on here.

( whimpering )

For Jason, huh?

Stop it, stop it!
Stop!

<i>You like that, Jason?</i>

Why'd you miss
the funeral?

Them bullets were meant
for me, man.

I fucked that
little black girl,

Reggie's little sister.

That's why Jason's dead,
right, Sean?

I don't know.
You tell me.

I been home one day
and I had to bury
my best friend.

You tell me why.
He was my best friend too.

<i>They shot him</i>
<i>'cause they thought</i>
<i>he was me.</i>

Why?

Did you rape her?

He punked me out
at that party.

<i>Who?</i>
Jason. He punked
me out, Sean.

<i>So?</i>
I don't know!

So nothing, I guess.

I wish they
would have shot you.

Hey, Sean!

I just don't give a fuck.
