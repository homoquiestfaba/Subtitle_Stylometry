Have you seen my phone?

I left it on that
wall over there.

It's got a gray phone case.

I haven't seen it.

Good luck in finding it.

Thank you.

Pardon me.

Have you seen my phone?

It's got a grey phone case.

No, dear.

I am sorry, I haven't.

What's wrong?

I think someone
stole my phone.

did it look like?

It's got a gray...
(phone dinging)

Want some lemonade?

Hi, two please.

Just a donation.

Oh okay, great!

Wanna put that in the jar?

Okay.

There you go.

What do you say?

Thank you.
Thank you.

Bye.
You too.

Oh!
Oh I'm so sorry!

So sorry!


Hi, how much for one lemonade?


All right, awesome.

There you go.

Have a nice day.

Thank you, bye.

Thank you.

Oh, thank you so much!

That was so thoughtful.

Hey, are you Peyton Hawthorne?


Yeah, your mom and
I volunteer together

at the animal shelter.

(slow music)

(phone dinging)

(traffic whirring)

(phone dinging)

(gentle guitar music)

Hey, sweetie.

How was your day?

It was fine.

(indistinct chatter)

Sophie!
Sophie!

Should we head inside?
Yeah.

Yeah, awesome!

Wait guys!


Happy birthday!

Thank you.

Late as always, I see.

Hey Landon.
Hey there.

Hey Landon, Tyler
just texted me.

He said you were supposed
to be at his house

like an hour ago.

Uh okay.

Tell Tyler I'll
be there in a few.

Bye.
(Landon) See you.

So where should
we put our stuff?

Uh, over there I guess.

Cool, let's go!

ready for some cake?

Sure!
Yeah!

So what's your
wish going to be?

Can't tell you that.

My Instagram photo
is gonna be amazing.

You know, I lost
like 20 followers

when Instagram did its
full like bot sweep.

That's terrible.
Isn't that ridiculous?

I mean I didn't have very
many followers to begin with

so then losing more.

Don't you guys like my cake?

Sure.
Yeah, yeah.

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

â™ª Happy birthday dear Peyton â™ª

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

So perfect!
(gentle guitar music)

Are you done yet?

(knocking on door)

Who's there?

It's Skylar!


Yeah.

Hi.

Happy birthday!

Good to see you.
Hi.

So what are we gonna do?

Well, I was thinking we could
maybe do some board games,

like Sorry, or
Candyland or Monopoly.

Monopoly!

Remember your brother
when we were playing?

He like flipped over the table!


Mom!
(phone ringing)

Is that an iPhone?

Yeah, isn't it cool?

I'm getting one for Christmas.

That's so not fair!

I have to wait til I'm 13.

Let me see that.

I saw the most hilarious
YouTube video the other day.

Let's see if I can find it.

What about Monopoly?

(knocking on door)

That must be Sophie!

Yeah!

(gentle guitar music)

This is a lame
excuse for a party.

What are you talking about?

I mean, look at you.

You're all off in
cyberspace somewhere.

You're on Instagram and
Sophie's on Snapchat.

Courtney's working on her blog.

I might as well have celebrated
my birthday by myself.

I know how you feel, Peyton.

You do?

How so?

I've been thinking
about this a lot lately.

Thanks to social media

I'm more connected
than I've ever been.

And yet I've never
felt so lonely.

I'm glad I'm not the only
one who feels this way.

Yeah, it's pretty
depressing all right.

So what do you
suggest we do about it?

eavesdropping girls,

but it sounds like you
could all use digital detox.

What is she talking about?


we give up our
screens for awhile.

But that would kill me.


Don't be so dramatic.

I'm not being dramatic.

I, I think I have a problem.

Go ahead, fess up.

We're all ears.

Okay, I will then.

Last night I stayed up
until four in the morning

watching YouTube videos.

And the night before that
I didn't sleep at all.

I think I'm like addicted.

There I said it, I'm
addicted to my phone.

Well then I must be too.

I mean, I check mine
like every five minutes.

I even sleep with it
under my pillow at night.

Peyton, you know
that's a fire hazard.

I know but I just
can't help myself.

Want some orange juice?

Orange juice, Courtney.

What does he
even mean by this?

Care to elaborate?

Clearly Andrew
misunderstood my last text.

And if I'm not mistaken,

I think he just
broke up with me.

Was there ever a worse
form of communication?

So about the digital detox.

If we're going to do this,
we should make a pact.

No screens for 24 hours.

What do you say?

But what about my
Instagram followers?

And my Facebook friends?

Come on Sophie.

They aren't your real friends.


Besides you're not gonna
lose all of your followers

in just one day.

Are we talking every screen?

Even my laptop?

Anything with
internet connection.

We can do this guys.

Right, we can help each other.

Okay, so we power off.

Then what, we just sit
around twiddling our thumbs?

Not at all.

We can...

Play board games!
Yes!

You can't be serious.

I'm up for a game of Monopoly.

Me too, I haven't
played it in ages.

Care to join us?

I've got some
business to attend to.

I'll be the cat.

Ooh, I want to be the shoe.


Yeah, I can be the banker.

(pieces rattling)


I mean, I'm not gonna judge.

(upbeat music)

(knocking on door)

Hey babe, you ready to go?

Just one more game.

But I only have an hour.

It'll only be a minute.

(phone dinging)

(Video Game Voice) Game over.

(bowl clattering)

What was that for?

Come on Tyler,
it's just a game.

(door creaking)

(slow music)

Hey.
(Cashier) Hi.

I got that for my birthday,
but it wasn't my size.

Oh okay.

Would you like store
credit or cash back?

Actually, could you
put it on my card?

Sure, no problem.

All right, there you go.

Thanks.
Yeah, of course.

Can I help you?

Yes, thank you.

I have this notebook too.

It's perfect for journaling.

Great, that's what
I'm getting it for.

It actually helped me
break my screen addiction.

You know, I've
been thinking about

cutting back myself recently.

Are you glad you did?

It gave me back my life.

Monopoly, really?

I mean, who wants
to play board games

on their 16th birthday?

How lame is that?

Uh huh.

She could have
flown us to the Azores

with all the money she has.

Oh, and I totally
forgot to tell you,

last night as I was sleeping

my dog got abducted by aliens.

Yeah.

Oh, I have to go.

Sorry we're late.

Got stuck behind
a student driver.

Hey, you're looking at one.

Sorry.

So about the pact.

I've been mulling
something over.

What if we went a week
instead of just a day?

I mean, how much good
can 24 hours really do?

You're crazy.

I agree with Peyton.

I did some research last night,

and it kind of shook me up.

Listen to this.

Teen suicide rates
have nearly tripled

since the introduction
of the smartphone,

the study finds.

MRis revealed that
brains on smartphones

are nearly identical
to brains on drugs.

And researchers say
that the average person

will spent over 34 years of
their life staring at a screen.

Am I the only one that finds
these things disturbing?

It sounds like the
risks of screen use

might outweigh the benefits.

But there are
so many benefits.

I mean, I just Face Timed my
aunt and she lives in Thailand.

And then there are
selfies and GPS.

I mean, where would
I be without GPS?

Why don't we just
reduce our screen time?

It's not that simple, Sophie.

I think we have to break
our addiction first.

I agree with Peyton.

One week.

Well, where do I sign?

Count me out.

I guess it's just
the two of us now.


You're spilling something
all over the floor.

Oh my gosh!

Do forgive me.

I was so busy texting
I didn't even notice.

It's actually, it's actually

a bottle of margarita
mix for my son

that I just picked up.

I must've hit it on
the door on my way in.

I'm so sorry.

I've made such a mess!

(Cashier) It's no problem.
I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Absolutely no problem.

we might have a trio.

Hey!
(gentle music)

Perfect.

No screens for one week.

we'd agreed to 24 hours?

You should probably read
the contract next time.

(gentle guitar music)

(washing machine dinging)

(indistinct chatter)

(speaking in Spanish)

Hey.
(Peyton) Hi.

How's that journaling going?

haven't started yet.

I'm not really sure
where to begin.

Perhaps I could be of help.

(pen clicking)

Oh hey hon.

Why aren't you
working on your blog?

We're fasting from
all screens, mom.

Not just our phones.

You can go to library.

I can't use their
computers either.

They're still screens.

Books, Courtney.

Talking about books.

Right.

You know, I think I
will try the library.

Oh great.

(phone ringing)

(phone ringing)


Why haven't you been
answering my texts?

Pick up your phone already.

Skylar?

Whatever.

Marilyn, I can't
believe teenagers today.

They're literally
glued to their phones.

dreadful, isn't it?

You know the other day I
was on my way to Pilates class

and this girl came
running up to me

and she asked me if
I'd seen her phone.

Poor thing.

She was utterly frantic.

That's how they get when
they lose their phone.

This is a cute shop.

You ate all the cookies!

That was a lot of work!

Mom, Skylar ate all my cookies!

Make her nose bigger.

Hurry up, we don't have all day.

Can't you see I'm trying?

Okay, now give her
skin a green hue,

but make it look realistic.

Oh, and can you mess up
her hair a little bit?

I'll do my best.

Successful trip
to the library?

These are totally antiquated.

(pen clicking)

What are you talking about?

This is from this year.

What?

Like six months ago.

Just as I thought.

I'm going to lose
all of my followers.

I'm so excited it's
almost Spring Break.

Hey!
Hey!

How was the exam?

So, about the digital detox.

You first.

Honestly, it's been great.

I've actually become
reacquainted with the library.

I kind of forgot it existed.

And you, Peyton?

I think I've done pretty well.

Okay, maybe I went
shopping a little too much,

but at least I
stayed off my phone.


Piece of cake, or cookies.

So I did do a little
bit of binge eating,

but it was totally
my sister's fault.

I haven't looked
at a single screen.

Why are you looking
at me that way?

What if we just exchange
one addiction for another?

Does that still count?

I'll have to think about that.

You know what I just realized?

We're actually having a real
uninterrupted conversation.

I could really get used to this.

Me too.
(phone dinging)

Oh, I forgot I have
to babysit today.

Peyton, your phone!

We still have three days left.

It's just for emergencies.

See you!

not an emergency.

(toy trucks rumbling)

(indistinct toddler chatter)

(slow music)

(phone dinging)


One.

(dramatic music)

You must be the
new babysitter.

I found this chicken thief

stealing a chicken
out of my coop.

Is everything okay?

He swallowed my
antidepressants.

911, yes I'm at...

There's a boy here.

He took some pills, I think.

Maybe three or four?

Yes, we're at we're
at 456 North Mason.

Yes, please hurry.

I don't know what's going on.

I don't know if he's okay.

(sirens blaring)

(intensifying music)

(indistinct chatter)
(slow music)

(sirens blaring)

(dramatic music)

(phone cracking)

Honey, why don't you
just wait here, okay?

How's the Reese boy doing?

Is he still in a coma?

Unfortunately yes.

what's his prognosis?

it's too early to tell.

It doesn't look good.

Peyton!

Peyton!

Any news on Dylan?

It's been almost a week.

Well, as far as I know
he hasn't gotten any worse.

I'm sorry you're going
through this, Peyton.

Sure wish you would
have kept that pact.

You're the lamest
brother in the world!

She didn't mean that, son.

But that was really
inappropriate.

You're right.

I shouldn't have said that.

I'm sorry.

You know Peyton, we
can't change the past,

but we can learn
from our mistakes

and do better in the future.

I don't know that I can.

Of course you can, honey.

Not having my phone is
like missing an appendage.

Now I've just replaced
it with my tablet.

get off the grid for awhile.

As if I'm the only
one that has a problem!

have problems all right.

But screen addiction
isn't one of them.

Oh really?

Monday, seven hours
and 33 minutes.

Entertainment, social media and,

Landon!

I didn't kill a kid.

How dare you!
(dramatic music)

(slow piano music)

What are these?

I've been meaning to tell you.

What's that?

Sorry, I should've
told you a long time ago.

You have a half sister.

What?

I was a junior in high school.

My boyfriend got me pregnant.

It wasn't consensual.

But that's horrible.

I had to give the
baby up for adoption.

Her name is...

Chloe.

I know her.

How do you...

(phone ringing)

That's the hospital.

Hello?

This is she.

What?

Oh, that's wonderful news.

Can we come visit him?

Right now?

Oh, thank you so much.

Dylan's awake!

(footsteps stomping)

What are you doing here?

Oh, I volunteer at
the children's ward.

Are you here to see a patient?

Yeah.

Dylan Reese.

Chloe, what happened?

I'm so sorry, Peyton.

I can't tell you.

I signed a
confidentiality agreement.

What I meant to say
was what happened to you?

I got in a car
accident a few years ago.

How did it happen?

I slammed into a
tree while texting.

I'm so sorry.

It's okay, I knew
I had a problem.

I was glued to my
phone back then,

but I never thought
it would lead to this.

That never would have happened

if I didn't break my pact.

What pact?

I was on day four
of a digital detox

when I fell off the
wagon, so to speak.

That's when Dylan
got into my Prozac.

Antidepressants?

The cyber bullying.

It really gets me down.

Chloe.

It's okay, mom.

I already know.

Hey Trish, are you sitting?

You are not going to
believe what I just read.

Hold on a second.

Daniel.

(speaking in Spanish)

I'm sorry, Trish,

but Kristen just married a
famous Hollywood producer.

No, Kristen Bowers.

Chloe's birth mom.

No, they never met.

It's a closed adoption.

Funny, I was thinking
the same thing.

Chandler Hawthorne.

Yeah, talk about a
change in circumstances.

I think I can
help you, Peyton.

Really?

he owns this cabin

on an island off the grid.

I went there to break
my screen addiction.

If you'd like I could
take you there with me.

You'd, you'd do that for me?

Of course.

Besides I've been itching
to get back to the island

since my accident,

but I don't feel
comfortable going alone.

I would really
love your company.

By any chance could I
bring a couple friends along?

They've been struggling
with screen addiction, too.

Absolutely.

can catch some fish.

Bet I can get double
what you can get.

I don't know about that.

(throat clearing)

Who do you think I am?

Some kind of moron?

Come on, Morgan.

She's like a sister to me.

Oh really?

I've seen the way
you look at her,

and I read your texts.

Oh Peyton, happy birthday.

You're such a
beautiful young woman.

And now you're going on a
trip with her behind my back?

Look, Landon and I

are just going on a fishing
trip to get off the grid.

We're just dropping
them off on the way.

Oh, so now you've joined
in on the digital detox too?

Okay, it was your idea for
me to cut back on my gaming.

I swear, Tyler, if
you leave on that boat,

we are finished.

(slow music)

â™ª Waves washing over â™ª

â™ª The sand on our feet â™ª

â™ª Time is an ocean â™ª

â™ª And I'm lost at sea â™ª

â™ª Tomorrow will find us â™ª

â™ª But I still believe â™ª

â™ª Searching for you
is looking for me â™ª

â™ª We are timeless â™ª

â™ª We are timeless â™ª


That's so cool.

(slow piano music)

love this garden.

roses, oh my goodness.

make yourself at home.

Check out this
incredible view.

And this awesome loft.


This is just like summer camp!

Dibs on the top bunk!

Speaking of beds,

would any of you mind
if I put my feet up

for a minute or two?

Of course not.

By all means.

We can make some snacks.

Perfect.

Anyone for pistachios?

Peyton?

Here it goes.

Five straight days
without any screens.

And no way to cheat this time.

What a relief.

Do you really think
things will be any different

when we get back?

Yeah, I think they will.

If we can commit to
making some changes.

are you suggesting?

I think we need to
set some boundaries.

Maybe cut our social
media time in half.

I think that's doable.

And we should probably
keep all screens

out of our bedrooms.

And turn them off at dinner.

Peyton, you're pretty
quiet over there.

It's just,

I've been considering giving
up smartphones altogether.

Hey girls, you guys
wanna go on a hike?

always up for an adventure.

Okay, yeah maybe
grab us some snacks.

Yeah.

I'll tell you where it's at.

So head back down to the dock,

and then about a quarter
mile along the beach

on the right hand side you're
gonna see the trail head.

Great.

Yeah, shouldn't take you
guys more than an hour.

Okay.

Yeah, have fun.

see you later.

Yeah, see you.

Bailey, you gotta
stay here, okay?

No Bailey, come on.

I know.

Have fun!


Don't fall.

You either, please.

I'm doing my best.

There's no hospital
on this island.

(Skylar) Here's the trail.
Awesome.

Come on, Courtney.

Slowpoke!


This is so gorgeous.


I have yet to see a
single mosquito, Skylar.

So what are you swatting at?

I could swear I feel my
phone vibrating in my pocket.

They're called phantom
vibrations, Skylar.

They'll go away eventually.

Did you see that
slug back there?

that was so weird.

It was like, hanging
from the tree.

still on the trail?

It's just a little overgrown.

A little?

I think we should turn back.

Come on, Peyton.

This island can't be that big.

I'm famished.

Okay guys, I think
we're officially lost.

maps when you need it?

Hey, I think I see
the remnants of a trail.

Let's try this way.

What time is it?

I think my blood
sugar is dropping.

Maybe around eight.

I'm sorry, Peyton.

I would have brought more
snacks if I'd known we'd be out

for so long.

It's okay, I'll be fine.

Maybe we should
pick up the pace.

(dramatic music)
(girls screaming)

Peyton!

(slow music)

Bailey.

(dramatic music)
(Peyton crying)


(slow music)

(dog barking)

Wait, one second.

I learned in survival camp

that you can actually
eat sting nettles.

Stop!
Don't touch that!

They're called stinging
nettles for a reason.

Trust me.

I know what I'm doing.

Wait, what's this?

(slow music)

Look, another one.

(footsteps tapping)

Thank God.

What happened to you guys?

We got a little lost.

But then we found these.

(gentle guitar music)

(Skylar That was so
funny when you fell off

the paddleboard yesterday.

I wouldn't exactly
call it funny.

I thought it was funny.

Oh, are these the
marshmallow sticks?

on the fire, Peyton.

Thanks.


I'm so sorry about
the trail girls.

My uncle must've stopped
maintaining it after my accident.

Accident, I thought you
were just born that way.

What happened?

Skylar!

What!

I slammed into
a tree with my car

a couple of years ago

and shattered my pelvis.

That's awful.

Unfortunately, that
wasn't the worst of it.

I got a brain bleed when
my head hit the dashboard.

The doctors didn't
expect me to survive.

Skylar, your marshmallow!

Go on.

So much of it is a blur.

I'm told that I was on the
brink of death for weeks,

but my lowest point came when

my doctor told me that I
would never walk again.

I swear when I heard that

I wanted to curl up and die.

I can't even imagine.

That's when I began
contemplating my mortality.

Something that I'd never done
while plastered to my screen,

Instead of succumbing
to despair,

I found myself overwhelmed with
this intense desire to live

and this rising conviction
that my life had purpose.

And I vowed that if I did live,

I would find out what
that purpose was.

And I did.

Life is precious girls,

and I don't want to waste
another minute of it.

Which is why you
tackled your addiction?

Yes, that's why.

But enough about me.

What's your why?

(gentle guitar music)

â™ª It's not the news â™ª

â™ª That any of us hoped
that we would hear â™ª

â™ª It's not the road we
would have chosen no â™ª

â™ª The only thing
that we can see â™ª

â™ª Is darkness up ahead â™ª

â™ª But you're asking us
to lay our worry down â™ª

â™ª And sing a song instead â™ª

â™ª And I didn't know
I'd find you here â™ª

â™ª In the middle of
my deepest fear â™ª

â™ª But you are drawing near â™ª

â™ª You are overwhelming
me with peace â™ª

â™ª So I lift my voice and sing â™ª

â™ª You're gonna carry
us through everything â™ª

â™ª You are drawing near â™ª

â™ª You're overwhelming
all my fears with peace â™ª

â™ª You say that I
should come to you â™ª

â™ª With everything I need â™ª

â™ª You're asking
me to thank you â™ª

â™ª Even when the pain is deep â™ª

â™ª You promise that
you'll come and meet us â™ª

â™ª On the road ahead â™ª

â™ª And no matter
what the fear says â™ª

â™ª You give me a
reason to be glad â™ª

â™ª And I didn't know
I'd find you here â™ª

â™ª In the middle of
my deepest fear â™ª

â™ª But you are drawing near â™ª

â™ª You are overwhelming
me peace â™ª

â™ª So I lift my voice and sing â™ª

â™ª You're gonna carry
me through everything â™ª

â™ª You are drawing near â™ª

â™ª You're overwhelming
all my fear â™ª

â™ª And here in the middle
of the lonely night â™ª

â™ª Here in the middle
of the losing fight â™ª

â™ª You're here in the
middle of the deep regret â™ª

â™ª Here when the healing
hasn't happened yet â™ª

â™ª Here in the middle
of the desert place â™ª

â™ª Here in the middle â™ª

â™ª When I cannot see your face â™ª

â™ª Here in the middle with
your outstretched arms â™ª

â™ª You can see my pain and
it breaks your heart â™ª

â™ª And I didn't know
I'd find you here â™ª

â™ª In the middle of
my deepest fear â™ª

â™ª But you are drawing near me â™ª

â™ª You are overwhelming
