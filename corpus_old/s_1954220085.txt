Stop! God damn it!

Dumb ass, you pulls up your
crime scene like that you're gonna

contaminate the damn evidence.

Oh my God!

Oh yeah!

Looks like the kid
is ripped ... apart.

It's Casey Gotrea and his daddy.

You know what
did this, don't you?

You don't want to hear
that ignorant shit, Mark.

I mean you and me both of us
know what did this, Sheriff

I'm out .....

When you finished with
what you're doing there,

call the Coroner's office
and get him out here.

I forgot to take, Sheriff.

You still don't believe
how many dead bodies ...

Now!

We're all packed.  Do you want
to know where?  Here we come.

Let's go to my home.
I've got to shower.

Um Jen.
-Yeah.

I have a little confession to make.

What did you do this time?

Remember when I told you my father's
godson was staying with us for a few weeks?

Yeah, Dave or something ...
you said your dad was like

helping him with career planning stuff.

Right.

I invited him to stay with us at
the cabin for a couple of nights.

But only for a couple of nights.

And then the rest of the
week, it'll just be me and you,

and we'll just hang
and do girl's stuff.

You know.
Have fun.

Maya.
This isn't supposed to be a party.

I know.  And I know I
should have asked you first.

But he really needs some time away.

He's been through some shitty stuff.

He's just as confused as you are,

But he doesn't have a mom
like you, to attend to, you know.

He's pretty lost.

You think I can talk to my mom.
Yeah. Why not?

Mom's great, Jen.  I don't
understand why you hate her so much.

Are you mad?
Shit!  You're mad.

Jen.

I'm not mad.
You know I can't be mad at you.

You're going to love him.
He's really cool.

And he's smart like you, not
to mention he's smokin' hot.

Maybe the two of you could,
you know ... hang out.

I don't think so.

Well, he is cute.

If he wasn't in fact my brother,
I'll probably do him.

I'm sure you will, Maya.

Bitch.
Slut.

Hey ya, the way I see it ...
it will be good for you.

You've always been such a loner.

Plus, with me going away
to school next month.

Anyway, being around someone besides me
might help draw you out of your funk.

It's only a couple of days.
Cause you are cute.

Who's that girl?

I have no clue.

Hey sweetie. How you guys doing?
Okay.

Guess we beat you here.
Guess so.

Jen, this is Dave.
Dave, this is Jennifer.

Hey Jen, how are you doing?
Good. Okay.

Nice to meet you.

Yeah, and I brought
my friend, Brook.

Who is she?
You never mentioned a girl.

This is the girl I'm seeing.
You won't even know she is here.

It is okay, right?
Oh, the more the merrier.

So.
What is there to do around here?

Uhh, there's canoeing,
we can rent a bike.

Skinny dip,
You can bake in the sun.

Just saying it's quicker.
Good work.

Want to do it again?
Ok, to the tree and back.

Okay, on your
mark, get set, go.

Same time if you're tired.  We'll do
more once your breath pick up a bit.

Jen, I have to be going.
You want to come say bye to me?

Troy, just still take
good care of her.

Yes, I will.

I'll be back on Sunday, okay?

I want you to call me every night
before you go to sleep, alright sweetie.

Want to give me a hug?

Jen, why don't you want
to give me a hug?  Come here.

You won't forget to call?
No, I won't forget.

Have fun.
I will.

Be seeing you.
I love you, okay.

Daddy!

Yeah.  What was that for?

I just missed you.
I just miss you so much.

Oohh. Princess.

Are you there Jen?
Hello.

Jen, you okay?

Oh, I'm great.
I'm not paying attention. Fine.

Excuse me.

Home sweet home.
Oh, my God.

Oh, Gods.

It's nice.
Very nice.

Is there a hotel around here?

Don't let the door hit
you in the ass, ok, Hon.

She's kidding, right?

Of course, she is ...duh.
Come on, let's go see the bedrooms.

Let's go, pick out our room.

That one is a bedrooms?
Yeah, you guys can have this one.

A twin bed?

I'm sure you guys could figure it out.

Hell, there is always a porch
you can sleep in next.

It is cool, my gal.
How?

God, .. please make daddy and mommy

in case I do make up for dad
to come back home again ...

is that ......

Jen.

If we're staying late, maybe we should
go in town and get some supplies.

I'll make a list for you and
Brenda to take to town.

It's Brook.
What?

You just called me Brenda,
and my name is Brook.

Hey Maya, why don't
you just go with them.

You know I'm going
to stay here with you?

Actually, I'd rather be
alone with me, myself.

Sure.  I mean, you are
okay being here, right?

Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm fine really, sorry just...

Really, it's cool.

Okay.
All right guys, let's go.

Welcome, all you in.
For whatever you want.

You kids just passing through?

No, we're staying at the
cabin on the lake, for a week.

Ma'am I'm sorry but
there's something in this water.

Oh dear!

There you go, Hon.
All gone.

Our dinner special tonight is fried
catfish, french fries and hash browns.

And your choice of large beverage,
orange soda, iced tea and beer.

Of course, if you all ask for beer,
I'm going have to see what I do.

Um, I guess hush
puppies are like fries.

You aren't from around here, are you?
-No, not even close.

Of course they're fried, honey.
Did you ever hear of baked tush puppies?

I'll just have a cheeseburger and fries.
Yeah, me too.

Ahh, make it three
cheeseburgers and fries.

All right.
Coming up.

I mean, is it just me, or just
everyone here seem weird?

No, it's not just you.

Do you think that it's best
that we get out, quietly.

Hello, mum.

Well, we're here

I tried to, but ..here

No, it's dead.

Yeah.

Everything but the phone.

That was supposed to be the idea.

No, you don't.  You want
me to meet you, and I don't.

And I am safe here.

You know what. I have to go.
I'll call you when I get some ......

Hello.
It's okay.

I'm Dustin.  I live in the cabin
next door to where you're staying.

Well, you scared the shit out of me.
That's right.

Sure you don't want anything?
No thank you.

You don't seem like a local.
I'm not.

You live here now, though.
For now.

Did you realise you're over
10 miles from town, right?

Yah, I remember that.
We drove here.

You carry that shotgun
with you, everywhere you go?

If you've seen what I've
seen, you'd understand.

And what have you seen?

Long story.

Well, I got time.
I'm gonna be here all week.

I brought my wife Kay
out here, about a year ago.

Dustin...

That was the last time I saw her.

Oh God.

That's horrible.

Did they ever catch him?
And it wasn't a man that took her.

Well, if it wasn't a human,
then what was it?

Your dad ...
never tell you about this place?

You mean like, any other
American folklore, right?

If you want to call it that.

Well, I mean,
I read up on some of it

when as was trying to
find out more about the place.

You believe in all that, don't you?

Like I said before Jeniffer,
this place isn't safe.

I am really sorry about
what happened to your wife.

I really am.

Don't you think
... I don't know ...

it's the kind of stuff that people make up
in small towns, cut through the bottom ..

monsters and stuff.

Let me put it to you like this.

For about 30 years, people
in this town, pets, wild animals

have been mutilated in these woods.

That's your pattern.

It seems that he mutilates
and kills the males and

females, it seems he abducts.

Every abduction, every
murder has gone unsolved ..

And believe this.

They will continue to go unsolved,
as long as it is still out there.

But why just abduct the females?

The creature is very human like us.

Anatomy is very similar
to that of a male human.

Very similar.

Close enough that it can
breed with the human female.

So yer

maybe this small town
folks could do even this.

But no one's gonna
do anything about that.

There's something in these woods ...

that's pure evil.

How do you even want to say that.

All I'm trying to say is ...
maybe you should leave, Jennifer.

Okay, it's official.  Boggy Creek
is a 10.0 on a Creepy Scale.

This place is weird.

That Dustin guy sounds just as weird
as those freaks we saw in town today.

Who isn't weird, Bud?

He does think there's
something out there in the woods.

Oooohh.
Is he hot?

What?

This mysterious cabin guy, Dustin.

I don't know, I have no idea.

He is.

I knew it.  Oh, Jen.
You have a crush.

He's okay.
He's so, so.

You should hook up with him.

If that ... guys I will march
right out there and do that.

What?
You my pimp?

Jen, I just want you to have some fun.
You know ... smile more.

Alright, you guys
brought the tent, right?

Mmm hmm.

Excellent.

Look, I got a portable stove,
propane, matches. I got everything.

So I think we're good.

You guys aren't going to be all scared
and shit out on the woods, will you.

Please
I'm just saying, you know ...

I don't want to be
the one doing all the work.

We do for an all rough
and rough a bit, right?

I like it scared.

But if were up to me,
I would just stay here,

where there is running water,
bath, nice comfortable bed.

How could driving be so
damn tiring. I'm exhausted.

I hear that.

Well, you'll sleep like a baby tonight.
It is so peaceful out here.

You've got to be kidding me.

You guys mind?
We're trying to sleep in here.

Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, nothing. Just writing.

So is it sad being here?

Ummm ... yeah.

But it's a good sign.

Good sign?

Yeah like ... I don't know.
I missed him so much and

while I'm here eventhough
he is not here anymore

I feel like I'm more near him
than I have been in along time...

like that I could ever be.
I don't know.  It's weird.

Surrounded by his stuff.

I feel like I'm home.

Isn't that crazy?

I feel a little crazy,
do you know?

You're not crazy.

You know Jen, I kind of envy
what you have with your dad.

I mean, I know he died and all, but
you guys were really connected.

That's something I never will
and never have with my parents.

We're just, we're just so different.

Yeah.

You know.
In a way you're lucky.

Yeah.  Maybe.

You know, I don't know how your rotten
parents got such a wonderful daughter.

They are crazy.
I know, that's why I have you.

That's right.
You know that's true.

I love you, girl.
-I love you too, Maya.

Thanks for coming with me.
Of course.

Even if you had to bring a circus.
I'm sorry.

It'll get better, I promise.

You always got to bring a party with you ....

I know right. Hey it's all your ....
Good night.

Good night.

Were you just in the woods?

I don't want you in the woods, ever.
You understand me young lady?

Cause the woods are
very dangerous, sweetie.

No one should go in there.

It's best you don't
... don't go.

What's wrong?
I just ... I thought ...

I thought I heard something.
I guess ...

You didn't hear anything?
No, I didn't hear anything.

Well, I'll just go back to sleep.

Yah ... Just look at their faces.

That was like "Aaahh, Aaahh"

That was a shitty
thing to do, Tommy.

Oh, come on, man.  Hey, we're
on vaca... Remember?  Chill!

Now look, if everything is okay,
we will go back to bed.

Yah, everything's fine. My boyfriend
just has a sick sense of humour.

He is a bit challenged in
the maturity department.

Come on, hey. What?
Oh, come on babe.

Look, it was just a joke,
all right.   That's all it was.

You all, two just make the ...

have some fun, and loosen up
a little bit man, for real.

But you should have seen your faces,
Blehhh, Aaahhh.

Behave!
I'll be right back.

I'm just getting started.  What I need
to do is just live a little bit. That's all.

Come on.

Life's too short.

Jen. I am so sorry he did that.

Why, oh, why is he even here?

I wasn't sure he'd come,
or else I would have told you.

He had a job just a couple of hours
away, and is off work tomorrow,

so he want to come and hang out.

But I promise, he's
gone by Monday morning.

Cross my heart. Hope to die.
Stick a needle in my eye.

Sorry.

Just don't wake me with
anymore of your surprises, Maya.

Okay.
Good night.

Hello?

Somebody there?
Who is it?

If I could see somebody out there,

you think I'll be asking if
there's anybody out there.

Don't talk to me like that.

Like what?
Like an asshole.

Baby...

You know, I didn't
realize that my fantasy

of sleeping with 2 beautiful
women will end up like this.

Shit...

I mean that floor
is hard as hell.

Where's  Jennifer?

She's probably out running.
She does it every morning.

Doesn't she know that leaving
us alone like this is dangerous?

Whatever.

Come here, girl.

Klein, call the coroner.
Tell him you got another one.

When you're done, just get your
pussy ass over here and help me.

Don't be such a scaredy-cat.
Get in.

Hey, hey.
Stop playing.

I'm not getting in there.
Look at it.

Look at all the green
stuff floating around.

Like fish poop or something.

Far as I know it
can be some green,

flesh eating bacterial
disease or something like that.

Like you even know what bacteria is.
It's just dousy, dumb-ass.

Come on.
Jump in.

No, I don't look like I'll ... You can
chill black ass ...You gonna jump.

Fine Tommy. ...get even worse.
Whatever.

Well, I guess I better
just get it over with.

Get it over with.

I can't do it.

I can't. I told you ...
It's nasty, huh.

Yeah ....
Could not do it.

Watch out.

Do you mind?
What's up, baby?

Morning
-Morning

What you guy's doing, man.

Oh, she thought she was about to
get me in that nasty ass water, man.

No, she didn't get it neither, though.

No, it was .....

No, we are not at the beach, guys.
I'm not getting in.

Hey, so did she tell to you about that
interesting experience at the diner?

Yah, yah.
She told me that. That was classic.

Yeah, oh my God.
The people in this town are so spooky.

I mean, we walk in the diner,
from the moment we walked in,

they just stared at
us, the whole time.

Yeah.
Yeah.

And this old guy
was on the porch,

I expected him to take out his banjo
and just go to work when we walked out.

Hey, I can't do this anymore, Troy.

I can't be doing this.

Remember I said
I got to discuss my .....

You made that painfully obvious, girl.

Well, I'm done. I'm finished and
mean at this time, I'm going back.

Do you have anything to say?

Well, goodbye baby.

So Jen is pretty bent out of shape
about us being here, huh?

No, she's fine.

She doesn't seem fine.

Well, it's kind of my fault.
I kind of put her on the spot.

She's just really been a mess
after her father dying and all,

and I didn't realize she
wanted to be here alone.

Now look.
Jen is a sweet girl.

She's just got a lot of things
she's gonna do right now, that's all.

She'll be all right.

Well, maybe but ...

I'm sorry. That doesn't give
you the excuse to be just so bad.

Hey! Watch it girl.  That's my
best friend you're talking about.

Now you know what?

I actually think it's great that she's
actually around people, you know.

I mean, being alone by yourself,
being a hermit like that.

That can't be good for nobody.

What happened to her dad, anyway?

He was found on the side of the
highway up there. In his running clothes.

They think it was a hit-and-run.
Some sort of large vehicle.

When they found him,
he was almost unrecognizable.

Shit, that's awful.

I've heard worse.  I mean,
at least he didn't suffer, right?

What?

All I meant was that
some people suffered.

He was lucky in like
a weird sort of way.

Hey.
Hey.

So you all want to take
the boat out or something?

I'm so hungry.
I'll go make sandwiches.

You know,
actually I'll go with you.

No, no.  Stay here.
It'll only take me a few minutes.

All right.

I got you.
Only landing bush.

Here you go.
Now, work Buddy.

Hey.
So what are you writing about?

Nothing.
Nothing, huh.

Hey look, I'm sorry for
imposing by being out here.

It's okay.

It's a great place.
Yeah, I like it.

Dave .. can you come
here for a second?

Just hold on.
Give me a minute.

So how long did your dad live out here?
11 years.

And this is the first time
that I've been back in a while.

Aren't you guys in a fight or something?
No.

No fight.  My dad he just
had some issues with people.

That sucks.
Yeah.

Dave.

Can you put some
sunscreen on my back?

Oh, damn.

Don't leave me out here.

Nolan, what the hell!
My car!

Don't act like you didn't do that.

How the hell did you
get that on the car?

Dude, why in the heat hell, would
I drive all the way out here

from butt fucked Egypt,
to decapitate piggy

and then sit around and just look
this nasty ass shit on my car, huh?

Why would I do
something like that, Dave?

We should call the cops.

There are cops around here, right?
-No.

Right.  Just hold off
on calling the cops.

You two try not
to kill each other.

I'm going to handle this.
I'll be right back.
Wait. Jen, where are you going?

We'll be right back.

I'm not the only one to
be digging this grave.
You gotta to digging that.

You're gonna be
helping to dig this, too.

Shut up, white boy!

Dustin, it's Jennifer from next door.

If you're in there,
please open up.

I'm not in there.

Someone threw a mutilated hog
on the hood of my friend's car,

and I want to know if it was you.

It wasn't me.

By the way, I'm Maya.

So wait. We're suppose to just
believe that it magically appeared there.

I don't care what you believe.
I told you I didn't do it.

Look, you're in a swamp
surrounded by deep woods,

there are dead
animals everywhere.

Just like I told you last night,
there's something out there.

It's been mutilating
animals for years,

even worse,
sometimes it mutilates people ...

who happen to be in the
wrong place, at the wrong time.

Aw come on, you're not talking
about the bigfoot.  Shit .. again.

I'm really sorry about
what happened to your wife,

and I think that you know that.

But I'm not going to be scared off.

My father, he left me that cabin and
I intend to stay there as long as I want.

Hey look, if you're so convinced
that there is something out here.

Why are you here?

Did you here anything about
these girls getting out of here?

Well. Was that supposed to
be a threat or something?  Huh.

You two, chill.

You I'm just saying,
he's got a gun.

Well I just saying, if he
was a threat or something,

then maybe we should do
something about it, you know.

Well, that's just great!

We've got dead pigs, man with a gun,
Bigfoot.  You 2 morons, in your car.

Hey.
Hey.

Damn. Well, that's done with.

I love Texas thunderstorms.
Yeah, me too.

I love it, like, just like this
white one I saw at the pool.

Where's Brook?

She had to sleep for a little bit.
Said she feels nauseous.

She's pregnant.

She got an IV.

So what was that all about earlier.
What do you mean?

The conversation
with your neighbour.

Think he's the one that
threw the pig on Tommy's car?

I think he really doesn't
want us to be here

and it make sense
that it would be him.

Right, Tommy's afraid of aussie,
I don't see him killing a pig,

dragging it through the woods.
You know what I mean?

I guess you're right.

Like if it's him, our neighbour and us out
here. You know what I'm saying like ...

Yah, I think it's him.

What do you think about this whole
Bigfoot thing? Do you think that's real?

Where are you offing toward that?

I have never been one for fantasy.
No.

Even if I was, I would be a lot more
terrified with some psychotic human being,

like, going after
people with a machete.

You know what I mean, like
not some big scary ape, please.

Hit!

What the hell!
What you doing?

Babe, do this.
Come here and do it.

Let me show you how you do it.
Watch the man how he did...

Ahh, you suck.
Let me show you.

No, no, no.  I was going to do that
...in high school though.

Where's Dave?
He's out on the porch with Jennifer.

Dave!

Can you come inside?
I'm scared.

One second.

No. Now.

Look. Just give me a minute.

You know ....
getting a little sick of this shit.

What shit?
You two flirting.

What the hell!

I get it.  Do you want to
bang her or something?

Do you Dave?
Huh?

What?

Nothing man. Nothing
at all.  I'm just saying.

Hey, you know what?

Why don't you come on over here
by our side. Come here. Come on girl.

Alright.
Let me help you out.

Fine, sorts.

That's a double for ...
you drink it kind of real slow.

That's done it.

Can you help her,
I got something for you ...

I just ...
You know what ...just

You guys are so great.
I love you so much.

It's good.

Maybe I'd better ...

That's fine.
I'll catch you later.

What exactly do you find
so interesting about her?

What?

I see the way you look at her.
What are you talking about, Brook?

I can get any guy I want,
and I chose to be with you.

So don't pull
this shit on me now.

Anyone?
Yeah, anyone.

Okay, then be with anyone.

Thanks, bitch.

Hey, maybe you can
hook up with Dave now.

Guys, I'm sorry.
Don't be. It's not your fault.

Hey, you you not going to ...
chase your girl, man?

No, that's what she expects me to do.
She's not going anywhere.

She's just a little bit
high maintenance, huh?

Uh, no. She thinks...

Yeah, a little.

So how many drinks did
you make for her, anyway?

Oh, I only gave
her two of mine.

Don't.

Then she took the whole bottle.
Oh, shit.

Alright, time I boo-boo.
I know.

I'm pretty tired, lady.

I hear you all.
I'm exhausted myself.

You know, you all can actually
take the bed if you want.

No, Jen. It's alright.

No, seriously.
It's fine.

I don't even have the
energy to get off this couch.

So go right ahead.

Yeah, you sure about that?

I'm sure.
You have to change the sheets.

Thanks, girl.

Sorry about the mess.

Are you sure you don't
want to go after her?

No, she's done this before.
Trust me.

She'll be back once she calms down.

Fucking asshole.

Should have never come
here with him anyway.

I mean, who does
he think he is, right?

What a prick.

Hello?

Hello?

Where am I?
Please, just me.

Shit!

Jesus Christ!

Thanks for looking for me, asshole.
I could have been killed out there.

...tried to pull this crap on me.

... fucking asshole. You think you
can get back at me. I don't think so.

Shit!

Somebody's there.

..enough of this car being shit!

Bloody Jen.
I can't take this lying down.

Jones!

Good morning, sunshine.
How are you?

Damn.
Do you have to be so loud?

Sorry.

I got this.
I got it.

Hey also.
Where's your girl, man?

I don't know.

She up yet?
Is she coming, or?

You see, dude.
She jacked my truck last night.

Went to some motel.

Yeah, stupid.

I guess the way she was acting, she felt,
hey I don't want to show my face again.

Whatever.

I'm gonna check on
her tomorrow afternoon.

Okay guys,
I got the waters.  Here.

Hey, bro.
Are these yours?

Yah, alright man.
Very funny

Why so much food?  You'd think we
won't be coming back or something.

Well, that's because
my girl's on her ass.

You see, when she is on a rag
like that, she gets very hungry.

Ah, asshole.
I'm just saying it.

Did you know that it's not such a good
idea to be out in the woods with a bleeder.

What?
Yeah.

Why?

It just, attracts the wild animals, they can
smell the blood from miles away.

Haaa!

Aw, what's wrong man.
Does this make you miss your girl?

Well, hell no, man. As soon as we
get back, it's over. That was a mistake.

Really. So what do you think she is
doing all alone by herself in the hotel?

Probably sticking little needles in a
Voodoo doll that looks just like me.

Wow.  This is
lovers lane, huh, Jen?

You know what. Your dad can
definitely pick up till midnight..

Listen. I'm going to finish up.
So as I was saying.

So tell us like, this guy
with a hockey mask on, right.

He comes over to the cabin,
he just starts, going at him,

and slashing this guy,
just picking him up

and put him in the back pack
and store him just to choose him,

everything like that.

Dude, we heard that one before.

Fine, why, you got a
better one you can tell?

Campfire stories are lame.

Well, this sucks right, man, whatever.
You got one better?

Okay, baby.
Thank you.

So when you get back, how long
are you going to be staying in .....?

Well, actually, that was
supposed to be a surprise.

What surprise?

In two weeks,
I'm off to boot camp.

Are you serious?
Yup. Time to cut the hair.

Does my dad know?

He's actually the one that got me in.

Now, we don't want to say
anything till we knew for sure.

But I didn't think
I had a chance till now.

If I play my cards right, in a few
years, I can apply to become an officer.

Maybe fly helicopters or shit.
How cool would that be?

That'll be cool man.

Oh, that's great Dave.
I'm so glad of you.

Thanks.

Well, congratulations.

Thanks.

I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
We got a long hike tomorrow.

Yeah, me too.
I'm getting pretty sleepy.

All right.
I'll put out the fire.

You having fun.
I am.

You forgive now for inviting Davies?
I guess I have to ...

I'm glad Tommy and Dave
were here .... not so much Brook.

Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

I'm so happy she didn't come. That
girl has a couple of screws loose.

Are you girls decent?

Aren't you suppose to ask that
question before you poke your head in?

No, what would be the fun in that?

Hey, where's Tommy?
Using the boy's room.

So, where is it going to sleep?

Well I'm here, and the 2
lovebirds are over there,

and you are here.

Cool.

Ten kids. Hey what you
think my battles are doing?

Ten.
Maybe one or two, but ten, no.

Hello?

Come on man,
this shit ain't funny.

What the hell is going on?

I'm tripping man.

It's probably some small ...  animal.

A teenie tiny, squirrel, aren't you?

Come on, Tommy man.

Oh me, a grown man from Texas.
Get it together.

Alright, Okay, I'm scared okay.
You win.

Hey guys, Tommy's
been gone for a while.

I'm going to go see if I could
find him.   I'll be right back.

Tommy!

Tommy!

Tommy, if this is another
one of your jokes, stop now.

I'm not in the mood.

Tommy, I mean it, stop.

Hey guys. He's not answering.
I'm getting really worried.

I'm sure his fine, Maya. It's probably
just another one of his jokey jokes.

And look, we're camping in
this farm under the full moon,

this is perfect material for him.

Yeah, he's right. He's fine.  Just
lay down. He'll be here in a second.

Yeah, you're right.
He surprises being a critic.

Goodnight.
Goodnight.

Sorry.

I don't know why you apologized?

If it was up to me,
I'd be sleeping right here.

Hey, I'm really worried.

Something just
doesn't feel right.

I'm going to see if
I could find him again.

No.., I got him.

I'll find him. Probably
constipating or something.

Tommy!

Come on Tommy, enough
is enough already, man.

You gonna make
me come find you.

That's a long shit, Tommy.

I just wish sometimes he'll grow
the hell up. You know what I mean?

Tommy is Tommy. He is always
been this way. You always love him.

Love him, yes. But love
him right now? Hell no.

Tommy, come on, man.
This is stupid.

I hate you, Tom.

Tommy!

Tommy! Tommy!
Fuck!

What was that?
Was it Dave?

He's been gone now for 20 minutes.

I'm gonna see him.

No. You're not leaving me in
here alone. I'm not going out there.

Well seriously, I'm sure
that everything is fine, I mean,

Tommy probably just talked Dave into
one of his little pranks or something.

No. Something is wrong, Jen.
Very, very wrong.

I'm scared.
Okay, just take a deep breath.

And, I'm sure everything gonna be fine.

And I'll go out there and I'll
check and I'll be right back.

I know. It's no.
Don't go out there. Please.

What are you doing?

Looking for something to use as a weapon.
Shit, we don't have anything.

What is that?

Shhh.

Oh my God!
Shhhh.

Don't move, ......

What do you mean?

I think it's a bear.
We have to stay quite still.

After a while it
would just go away ...

Well, it came looking
for me, remember?

Oh my God!
I'm scared.

Shhhh..
You gotta stay quiet.

Okay.
Shhhh.

Where the hell is the boat?
Where's the boat?

Maya, run.

Run!

Tommy!

Maya, we have to go now.
We can't stay here.

No, I can't leave.

I know.  Listen to me,
you can't help him now.

We can't help him now. We have to go.
We have to save ourselves.

No, I can't.

I'll help you away.
We can't stay here.

Listen .. I need you to stay here.

Whatever happens, you're
gonna be safe here, okay.

We have to fix this ....

Maya, look at me.

Trust me.

Come on Jen!
Help! No, no....

Listen, listen to me.
You can't help her now.

You gotta run to the highway.

Listen. Damn it.
Jen, you run!

Now.
Get moving.

Come on...
Come on ...

I need help, I need
you to call somebody.

I need help. Something ...
Something is chasing me.

Mom?

Mom.

Come on. Come on...
No...
