Hey, shut the fuck up.

[people whimpering]

<i>Check on the west side
of the school.</i>

<i>No activity.</i>

â™ª

[siren wailing]
[people shouting]

Excuse me. Excuse me.

Chief, patching the mayor in.

[Alston] Put it through.
[phone ringing]

This is Alston.
[man] <i>Alston?</i>

<i>This is Mayor Wimbly.</i>

<i>You saved a lot of those kids,
but we need everybody else out</i>

or you're out, understood?

<i>We can't afford any more
casualties. End this.</i>

It's not over.

[people whimpering]


[man 2] It's been
16 fucking hours.

Shannon,
I think the government's

been taking advantage of me.

Let's plan our exit strategy.

[gun clicking]
[people screaming]

Hey, shut the fuck up.

[man 2] Everybody listen up!

Everyone line up in the middle
of the gym, on your knees.

Quiet down!

a comment?

On or off the record?

What'd the mayor say?

Word from the mayor
is my team stands down.

He'll talk as long as it takes.

But we don't have that long.

Yeah, I agree.

And once they realize those
kids were the only leverage,

this shit's going to go south.

So what would you do.
If you were me?

I'm you, I give us the nod,
Let my team clean it up.

We'll fix it. Go back inside,
business as usual.

â™ª

Mason online over. Go for Miller

Studied the plans.

The roof is composed
of steel panels, durable,

will open for us, will not
fall in on the hostages.

<i>And the east wall
is the place for the blast.</i>

Locals won't see it,
they'll be trying to get in

from the front while
we extract from the side.

Mason for Rogers.

In position, guys.
'Bout to light it up.

[mutters indistinctly]

Mason for Connolly.

En route,
less than one mike out.

Confirm when landed.
[Conner] <i>Roger that.</i>

This doesn't feel right.

You gotta do something.
Hey, we got orders.

You wanted to be here.
I fought to have you here.

It's what we do.

Get the fuck out of here.


[Conner] Put your hands up!

Turn around and walk

I'll come towards ya.
But she's coming with me.

You're all coming with me.

You okay?


I'm okay. Shit.

He dead?
Yeah, he's dead.

So you okay? You all right, kid?

You know what he did, right?
Fuck.

Yeah, long time ago.

All right, kid, get out, go.
I can't leave you here.

Joaquin, get the fuck
out of here, now, go, go.

I got this, go!

Ain't no white man never
did me no good like you, man.

Get the fuck out of here!

â™ª

Go ahead, do it.
Do it.

Do it.
You'll be the first to die.

All right, let's do it then.

â™ª

I don't think
you wanna do that Connolly.

Okay. All right,
all right, you got me,

you got me.
All right, all right.

â™ª

Damn. This brother
had value to me.

Blood begets blood.

Tyrone Pettis. You really want
a government body on you?

I got six already.

Smoke this motherfucker.

Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no.

Nah, wait.

Grab Cornell's gun.
We're not gonna kill you.

We're gonna let you explain why
you killed an unarmed Black man.

You really gonna let
this motherfucker pass?

These... are my streets.

I know everything that goes
on in these streets.

Nah. It's not a pass.

I got plans for Conner.

â™ª

You got lucky today.

Bullshit.
I'm telling you like it is.

just because we haven't
made anything stick,

doesn't mean we don't know
how ruthless Tyrone Pettis is.

You take out one of his men.
He takes out you.

Maybe we should get
Chief Alston in here, huh?

Why the fuck would I do that?

Because you guys don't know
what the fuck you're doing.

That kid's out there
right now and he needs help.

He's in danger.
He could back up my story.

Go find the kid.
Look, Conner.

been under stress, late nights,

always taking personal touch
with your parolees.

The best we got.
But even the best slip up.

Find Joaquin.

Right. Joaquin Smith, right?

Yeah.

Found him.

â™ª


Damn it!
What happened, Conner?

Because your parolee
pissed you off.

When you confronted him
and got jumpy.

I tried to save this kid.

If that's the truth
then you're really fucked.

Suspended.

Badge and your piece.


Fuck both of you.

["LA LA LA (Love You Like)"
by Duce Haus]

[children chattering]

Hey, hey, look who's here,
Uncle Pettis.

How you doing today?
[child] Good.

What you looking at?
I see you looking at that money.

How's those grades?
[girl] Good.

Real good?
[girl] Yeah, yeah!

[boy] All A's.
Yeah, you first. All A's?

What about you?

[girl] I got like one B and...
One B and all A's?

Yeah.
And you?

[girl 2] All A's.
All A's?

I'll show you my grades.

Here you go.
[children chattering]

All A's. All A's and one B,
I like that.

You're gonna change that B
to a A, right?

[girl] Yeah.
And you?

[boys chattering]
And you?

Wait, wait, wait.
Who's talking?

I'm talking.
Oh.

Thank you.

And what are your grades?
[indistinct chattering]

this and next time I see you,

you're gonna have
all A's, right?

Just keep doing your best.
That's what I care about.

What you doing, young man?
How you doing?

[teenager] All right, yeah.
Tell me about them grades.

Oh, yes sir, all A's.
All A's? Here you go.

Thank you so much.
Man, thank you, sir.

There you go, no, I'm not
short-changing you, all A's.

I'm hoping that you're
gonna do so well and go to

college that y'all can
loan me some money one day.

Yes sir, we'll be looking out
for you.

All right.

Lucifer's left his lair.

â™ª

See what he wants.

Fuck you wanna do, white boy?

To what do I owe the pleasure?

Love what you've done here.

Despite the rumors.


Speaking of rumors, um,

have you heard what's happening
on the Southside?

They passin' out fentanyl
like suckers.

Any plans on addressing that?

Knowing what battles
to fight and when to fight,

that's critical.
That's why I'm here.

You left a loose end.

No. I don't leave loose ends.


And you did.

No loose ends. It's a strategy.

Know what battles
to fight and when.

It's of critical importance.
I like this.

You like what?

Two intelligent men,
discussing strategy in our city.

Re-election this year.

I'm expecting a large donation.

As always.

This [indistinct]
motherfucker want?

Ride with me.

That one right there.

No gun, no witnesses.

Nope, something doesn't
feel right.

He asked for you.

[barista] Two black coffees.
Thank you.

Thank you, darling.

He shot a Black kid.

I don't know how to help.

I need you to work out
that debt you owe me.

Your little stunt cost
me my job today.

Consider us even.

I get no tangible benefits
from you being fired.

You need to replace my asset.

The supply side
of supply and demand.

Go fuck yourself.

Nah, Big O.

Not here.

talk to Pettis.</i>

And say what?

That if anything
happened to Connolly,

we're gonna bury him.

Well, it's a little overkill.

Why is that every time
it comes to going after Pettis,

you seem scared?

I've never been scared
and Pettis isn't stupid.

[toilet flushes]

â™ª


[Conner] I'm home, baby.
[door opens, closes]

Sorry I'm late.
It was a long day at work.

That's okay, baby.

Did you get the raise?

They're going to tell me.

Need that money, Conner.


[knocks on door]
Can I come in?

Yep.
You okay?

Why are you on the floor?

â™ª

Just give me a moment,
Okay.

Hey, baby?
Yeah, babe?

Oh, we're gonna need that raise.

Yeah, I know, baby, I know.

I mean we.

I know, babe.

I mean we.

You're pregnant?
[horn honking]

[man] Hey!
Baby on board!

[Candace chuckles]

Wow.

I thought you'd be happy.
No, no, I'm happy. I am happy.

You're happy.
Yes. My God.


Are you happy?
Yeah.

Okay.

I can't believe
we're having a baby.

I love you.

Love you, baby.

â™ª

You're going to be
the best mom ever.

[chuckles]
I can't believe

there's a baby in here.

I know.
Hello, baby. Hello.

[laughs]
Hello?

Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
We can't park here.

Seriously,
they're gonna kill us.

Let's get you something
to eat, something healthy.

I know great diner.

Wait, healthy diner?

Bacon and eggs, baby, protein.

Okay, bacon and eggs.

Okay.
Get up slowly, honey.

Nice and easy.
[laughs]

We don't want to take any falls.

Yeah, it's fine.

You hungry?

Yeah, I'm thinking
an avocado, one every day.

It's good for brain health.
Where'd you learn that?

I read about it,
I've read a couple things.

[chuckles]
I heard some things.

[indistinct chattering]

[dog barking]

â™ª

you gonna be okay,

just breathe.

I'm deeply sorry about...
If you don't get your gutter,

fake Brooks Brothers ass
away from me and my family...

Cornell died because of you!

And I told him
to leave your ass alone.

Now! Go!

[dogs barking]

Look at it.

You want me to leave with that?

I didn't think so.

She still mad.

twice as much, baby,

'cause you gotta
feed the baby now

Okay, I ate plenty.

But the thing is
you don't deal with

some of the morning sickness
stuff that I deal with.

So no baby, no say.
Seatbelt.

[Candace chuckles]
you gotta wear a seatbelt.

[Candace] Mm-hmm, okay.
No question about it.

â™ª

[both grunt]

Don't fight it, white boy.

Conner! [panting]

Don't fight it! Don't fight it!

[Candace screaming]

Conner! Conner!

Conner! [sobbing]

<i>Conner!</i>

<i>â™ª</i>



Candace!

Candace! Mother...

What did you do to my wife?
Where is she?

Call me on this when you got it.

When I get what?
My money.

What money?

I tried to discuss it with
you like a gentleman earlier,

but clearly you needed some
additional motivation

to hear what I was saying.

You terminated Cornell.
Cornell was just 25.

He brought me about 250 a year.

He had at least
20 more years of service.

Subtract five years
he might have spent in prison,

so you owe me, what?

Six point two million.

What?

Lost earnings, Connelly.

But to show you that
I'm a reasonable businessman,

I'm going
to discount that amount

for inflation and
other variable reasons,

and we'll just say
you owe me, uh,

even two million.

I don't have 2,000.

I know. City pays you shit.


Southside address, what
am I supposed to do with this?

A treasure map. Find a way
to save your wife, Connolly.

How much time
you think you need?

It's noon.

I give you till midnight.

That's impossible.

Have faith, pull yourself up
by your bootstraps.

Find a way
where there is no way.

That shit sound familiar?

The keys in the glove box.

â™ª

Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

â™ª

Fuck!

[tires squealing]
[horn honking]


[tires squealing]


<i>â™ª</i>

[horn honking]

All right, motherfuckers.

[knocking on door]

[knocking on door]

Shit.


Hey, brother. Long time no see.

Maybe not long enough.

I wouldn't be here
if I had a choice.

[Tim] Move your foot.
I need your help.

I said move your foot.

I can't do that.

You didn't listen to me before.

And you know how that ended.

Do you remember when Dad died?
You were twelve.

You found this gun when
Mom was packing up his stuff.

Yeah. So?

You aimed that gun at me.
And I told you,

"You ever point of gun at me
again, I'll break your face."

â™ª

Yeah, but we're not 12 anymore.

[both grunting]

Get off of me!

[both grunting]


I couldn't carry you forever.

Yeah. I was readjusting.

For how long, Tim?
How long is it supposed to be

till I'm okay with
shooting those people?

I adjusted. You just do.

[grunts]
[glass shatters]

I'm not you.
That's a good thing.

What do you want, Conner?

I need two million dollars
by midnight.

Okay, why didn't you say?
Let me just go get my wallet.

What the fuck man?

Tyrone Pettis. He took Candace.

I killed one of his guys.

Don't you ever learn?

Have you not shot
enough people in this life?

If you walk away, she dies.

She'll die anyway.

You're gonna be an uncle.

[phone vibrating]

Yeah.

Yeah.

If I have to.

Don't fucking wanna. Yeah.

All right.

We don't have
any other family, Timmy.

I hope it's a girl.

[chuckles]
[groans]

What the fuck'd you do that for?

What'd I do that for?

You know why.

Tell me everything.

â™ª

[man on radio] <i>Hey,
all you noon-time rides.</i>

<i>There are reports of a parole
officer shooting in town,</i>

<i>Jackson Police Chief
just announced the seizure</i>

<i>of all security camera footage
in the area.</i>

<i>A bold move.
He's taking questions now.</i>

There are rumors
that this seizure

is being served
without a warrant.

Is that true?
The warrant's on site.

aware of the other rumors

that you provide a haven

for drug dealers in this city?

Who said that?

Are you aware they also say
that the only reason

why you have this job

is 'cause you milked
that hostage situation

or you'd still
be on a desk, Chief?

A lot of people
have died on my watch.

I will always bear
that pain every day.

And that pain drives me

to protect this city.

This city. It's all for you.
So you can print that.

for the record?

are these allegations true?


â™ª

That was beautiful.
I almost believed that bullshit.

Get the fuck out of here,
you're cracking me up.

Your stunts keep
getting bigger and bigger.

You fly too close to the sun,
you're going to burn your wings

and everybody
else's in the process.

What do you care?

You still got your money.

Why are you here?

Well, I had some family
business to take care of and

I heard about
your little fiasco, so

I want to see the show.
Show's over.

We're all watching you, Chief.
We're all watching ya.


There's only one team
I know that can pull this off.

It didn't end
the way it started.

Everything changed for everybody
that night, not just you, Tim.

Everybody.

We all had to disappear
into a city of people.

Even if you're right...
[knocking on door]

Oh, shit.

â™ª

Good to see you, boys.
Cap.

You look like shit, LT.

Tim.
Cap.

How's Jeremy?

He's happy.

He's 20.
Wow.

Say no more.
You all right?

No.
She alive?

Yeah, she's alive.
Where is she?

I don't know.

But Tyrone Pettis has her.

[Candace screams]

If you sit still,
I'll have my guys take

the tape off your mouth.
[Candace sobbing]

Where's Conner?

What are
you going to do with me?

That depends on how
resourceful your husband is.

I need your help, please.
When?

Tonight.

â™ª

All right. Anybody else know?

No one, just us.

All right. We get the crew.
This is family.


Family is overrated.

Not this fucking family.

â™ª

["Howling at the Moon"
by D Fine Us]

Mr. Miller, are you sure
you want to be here?

Yes.

If you want to reach
your full potential in life,

you need to show up.

Understood?

â™ª


Tommy says we need to get
a MacBook 2018.

Nothin' else.

[phone ringing]

Hold on there, darling, hang on.

[phone ringing]
[woman speaking indistinctly]

Excuse me, I need to take this.

Who's this?

Who is it? Damn, girl. Mason?
Man, fuck you.

â™ª

Mr. Miller, what are you doing?

Showing up.

Where is everyone?
You expected a surprise party?

I know you raggedy
sons of bitches weren't

about to
start a party without me.

Boom! Conner, my man.


Good to see you, man,
you're a sight for sore eyes.

Hang in there,
we're gonna get her.


Hi there, Tim.
Long time.

How are you, brother?
Good to see you.

Already started this early, man.

Come on now,
we're gonna need ya.

Cappy.

My motherfucking homies.
[Conner] Yeah. Dwayne.

Things never change. CPT.

Don't make me
bust your ass, Tim.

[speaks indistinctly]

Good to see you, buddy.
Good to see you. Wassup?

Thanks for coming.

Cap.
Did you get we discussed?

[speaks indistinctly]

Let's see it.

â™ª

I pulled city code
blueprints of the property.

Had a permit issued
for the room in the back.

So exactly whose property
are we looking at and why?

Conner. Why don't you tell 'em?

This morning,

I killed a banger who was
beating on one of my parolees.

Turns out he was
one of Pettis's boys.

Shit.

Yeah, tell me about it.
They got Candace.

We need two mil.
Could be a set up.

No, if they wanted me dead,

I'd be dead.

Look, everything we've done
till now has been under

the cover of the flag.

Even when the Corps wasn't.
This ain't that, man.

We got no cover.
This is outside the law.

You gotta know that.
[Miller] I'm all in.

Last time I felt alive, was
the last time we were together.

And no, shit didn't end
like we wanted, but fuck,

when Cap called,

that's all I needed.

Well, I don't give
an aardvark's asshole

why we got back together,

I'm just glad
that we reunited boys.

Okay. So what's the plan?

At dark, DEA, smash and grab.

Back by 2300.

Well, you know what? There's
only one thing missing, then.

We're gonna do all that,
we need guns.

Big fucking guns.
Hell yeah,

that's what I'm talking about.
Lots of 'em.

â™ª

Oh, yeah.

â™ª

[woman sobbing]

Let her go!

End of the line, motherfucker.

Go ahead, D, say it?

You say it.
Man, I'm redneck as fuck,

you know I can't say it.
You say it mother fucker.

Fine. D-E-motherfucking-A,

my nigga.

Fuck you!
Y'all ain't no police! Can't be!

Sure, well you're right.
We ain't.

Do you know
what the fuck we want?

You have no idea
who you're robbing.

All right, let's go. Come on.
The fuck.

â™ª

Got it.

Somebody asked for money?

shit hit the streets.

Motherfuckers.

Hey.

All right, I'll be there in 20.

[siren wailing]

You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

That wasn't fine back there,
man, what the fuck happened?

I'm good bro, I'm good.

Hey, hey. What happened?

â™ª

That night...

Does that ever get to you?
What night?

You know what night.
Yeah.

I had to make a fucking call,
man. I did that.

End of story.

A lot of people died that night.

Yeah, well they would
have fucking killed everybody.

We saved lives.
We saved a lot of fucking lives.

Now we move the fuck on.

I sent my guys in to die,
and now I gotta live with that.

You think I don't
live with that?

You think every day, I don't
fucking think about that?

Let me tell you something.

When everything is on
the fucking line and you gotta

make a decision
between death and death,

there are no wrong choices.
None.

D'you understand?

Yeah.

Let it go, man.

Come on.

â™ª

What the fuck happened here?

Fuckin' Pettis.

You almost fucked everything up.

What did...?

Those cats came in there
looking like DEA.

How many?
Five.

Fuck.

See their faces? Was it Pettis?

I don't know.

He claimed you were ready.

I ain't gonna say nothing
about nothing. You can trust me.

Just shut the fuck up,
you're not gonna say anything.

Sorry, Danny.

â™ª

Hey, I need some help over here.

â™ª

You want a hit?
No.

I'd appreciate it if
you didn't smoke that around me.

You hear her?
Being all prudish and shit?

Actually being all pregnant.
And shit.

Oh yeah?

â™ª

I can respect that.

Boy or girl?

I don't know.
I just found out today.

Put that shit out, nigga.
You heard she's pregnant.

And, aw,

mean old gangster Pettis
spoiled of your perfect day.

I mean, it's not that perfect.
You mean there's cracks?

Behind that white,
perfect picket fence?

I mean nothing is perfect.

We struggle
just like everybody else.

Conner settles for this

low-grade job when
I know he's much more.

How's that for
a role model for my baby?

Do you have kids?

Do you have a family?
Streets of my family.

My so-called mom

left me on a corner
shortly after I was born.

I'm sorry.

[phone ringing]

Yeah?
The fuck did you do?

[Pettis] When?
Don't insult me.

I told you the Southside,
it was off limits.

You did.

And I'm here, in my office,
after hours, mindin' my business

wondering
why the chief of police

is calling me
fucking with my high.

Don't forget why
you're in that office.

<i>I helped you get it.</i>

I could help you lose it,
fucking jerk-off.

[Pettis chuckles]

Well, looks like your man
is coming to get his lady.

And his baby. How's that
for positive role model?

Well, I must say,

was an honor suiting up
with you motherfuckers again.

Don't go getting all sappy
on us now, Cap.

What's the take?

1875, three zeros.

Not enough

That's all right,
that's all right.

Just take your cuts,
all right?

Hey, hey, hey, I'm here for you,
man. Not the money.

â™ª

Start a college fund.
Well, you know, uh,

I could use a new single-wide.

I bet you could.

but tell you what,

we're here for you.
I love you, brother.

You... you missing what's
happening over here?

I quit my job.

We didn't tell you
to quit your job.

Man, you white boys are crazy.
[Conner laughs]

[phone ringing]

â™ª

I thought you might be dead.

Put her on.
What? My word isn't solid?

No, it's not.

If you want your money,
prove she's alive.

As you wish, cowboy.

â™ª

Say hi.

Hello.

Baby? We're comin'
to get you, baby.

Conner.
[Conner] <i>Candace!</i>

Don't you fucking hurt her!

I'll text you the address.
You come with any cops,

I think you know the deal.

Don't you fucking hurt her.

So what we gonna do?

I'ma get my money
and let her go.

So you still trust
these white boys?

One of them.
Man, he's a snake too.

They all snakes
and they gonna bite us

in the ass if we let him go.

We? Us?

Motherfucker,
this is my operation.

And I don't appreciate
you questioning me.

Lemme ask you a question.

You hungry?
No, sir.

Do you want for anything?

No.

Then when I tell you
what the deal is,

I don't wanna hear
the way it might be.

Understood.

That's my bad.

But I've been riding with you
since you started this shit.

And I'm gonna
tell you like this,

if we let these white boys live,
none of this shit gonna matter.

'Cause we gonna be upstate.
Doing life.

And I might not be
around to protect you.

You don't have to do that.
You stop being nosy.

You were right.

Help us.

Let us leave, go somewhere where

we don't have to look over
our shoulder every night.

You want me to help you?

You're not here
because you're stupid.

He's not wrong, leaving
witnesses would be stupid.

But we leave,
and there wouldn't be any.

There's only one way
to guarantee they don't talk.

You sure
I can't change your mind?

No, sir. He has all the leverage
and no reason to escalate.

But what if he does?
He won't.

Doesn't make sense.

Me and Tim got this.

All right, you need me,
I'm at the ready.

All right? Let me know
when you have her.

I will.

Danny Fields is the largest
drug dealer on the Southside.

This hit was done
with power and precision

and the fact that they did
not take the drugs leads me

to believe that
it was not their rival.

We'll interview Danny
when he gets there.

Danny's dead.

Fuckin' heart attack.
[man] What?

You didn't use the 'fibs?
He was loaded with drugs.

OK.

They were dressed as DEA.
Talked to the feds,

they haven't run
anything around here.

They scrubbed the walls
and the buckets,

took a million worth
of dope off the streets.

So my question is,
are we looking to arrest them

or commend them?

Any leads?
Nah, they're ghosts.

We found two dancers,
patrol's bringing them in now.

Oh, Christ.

This is a waste of time.

Get me something real.

[door closes]

Something is wrong with Chief.

He's stressed.

Nah.

He's different.

I said he's stressed.

[announcer speaking indistinctly
on TV]

You hungry?

Get me a fish sandwich, man.

Who.
You, nigga! What you mean who?

All right.

This is that bullshit.

[door closes]

I'm going to relieve myself.

Let you do the same
when I get back.

Thanks.

[announcer continues speaking
indistinctly]

â™ª

Our Father, who art in Heaven,

hallowed be Thy name.


â™ª


Shit.

There's only
one way in and out of here.

Anybody want to get at me,
they better come face to face!

â™ª

This can get ugly.

You thought of any names?

No, not yet.

If it's a boy, I like Tim.

That's not bad.

Conner Junior,
that's not bad either.

Girl?

Millie.

Grandma.
Yeah.

Why didn't you go
to Mom's funeral?

I was in a dark place.

I gotta tell you something,
Conner.

Don't, don't.

Everyone fucks up.
Don't worry about it.

This may end bad, you're right.

But if it does,

there's nobody I'd rather
go out fighting with.

Hey, do you mind stopping
up here? I need to take a piss.

Yeah.

This is Mason.

<i>I need you and your team.</i>

Hey, remember one thing.
No such thing as off the record,

Captain.

[phone beeps]

[Steve] <i>Hello?</i>
En route?

<i>Hell no, I'm not coming!</i>

Becky's here raisin' seven kinds
of hell

all over this shit...
...off the goddamned phone...

What?

[Steve and Becky speaking
indistinctly]

[phone beeps]
Oh, fuck.

Shit.

No!
God damn, I can't hear

myself think.
Hello, Mason, listen.

[Becky speaking indistinctly]

â™ª

All right, come on, let's go.
Let's go, come on.

Better? Let's do this.

See a white girl pass by here?

Everybody pack up and clock out.

[woman] Girl, what's going on?
[woman 2] I don't know.

â™ª

Clock out, now.

Oh, yes sir.

â™ª


[both grunting]

You're fucking pregnant. I don't
want to hurt you, but I will.

This is what a nigga gets for
trying to be nice to a bitch.

â™ª

I'm here to see Tyrone Pettis.

I got his money.

Two clicks out.
Aye, aye.

I didn't want to activate
the tracker on Connolly, but,

I can't leave a soldier behind.

Are you ready?

Let's go get her.
Let's do it.

â™ª

Yo, take their straps, man.

Get the bags. Let's go.
Come on, this way.

â™ª

[announcer speaking indistinctly
on TV]

All right, I'm here.
Where's my wife?

Shh!

[announcer speaking indistinctly
on TV]


Yes! Yes! Yes!

Haiti hasn't beaten
the US in football in 20 years.

But back to business.

Count it.

The deal is
once I get my two million,

you get to see her.

That's after
the count is confirmed.

I wanna see her right now.

You don't make
fucking demands to me!

I will have you both
killed where you stand.

Well, I know you killed Joaquin.

So? That little bastard
stole from me.

I consider that unacceptable.

One point eight-five.

That was fast.
We count millions on millions.

I know the count.
So you're short.

Maybe. We took what was there.

I also took a million dollars
worth of product off the street.

That's gotta
have some value to you.

â™ª

Follow me.

[Conner] Baby. Baby!
[Candace] Conner. Conner.

Did they hurt you?
They're not gonna let us go.


Thank you, thank you kindly.

For what?

Oh shit, somebody here
doesn't know.

Doesn't know what?

How do you think I knew
who you were when I saw you?

How do you think I knew
where you had breakfast

in the morning?

How do you think I knew
you were the perfect person

to knock off my competitor
without it getting back to me?

I don't know
what he's talking about, okay?

I got one, two, three bullets

that say you know exactly
what the fuck I'm talking about.

â™ª

Remember, we had to disappear.

No job, no family.

Jesus, Tim.
[Tim] Look at this shit.

Look at my veins.

Him. He supplied it.
I couldn't pay him. Now I owe.

You owe him?

I'm your fucking brother.

Oh shit, the Brady Bunch
up in this bitch.

Because of you,

I can't fucking sleep at night.

I see his fucking face.

It haunts me every...

You know it wasn't my call!
Every night!

It wasn't my call!
I was taking orders.

Hold on, what?
What fucking orders?

Brownsville Road standoff.

We were taking orders.
[Pettis] Hold up.

You were the ghosts
that killed my people that day?

I thought you was
washed up in Afghanistan.

That's the official story.
Unofficially...

we did the dirty work
for Uncle Sam.

That was my high school
fucking teacher.

My basketball coach. Only people
I cared about the fucking world.

I was the one that triggered
that blast. It was me.

Well maybe it's you who should
take this bullet in the head.

No. No. Right fucking here.
Put it right fucking here.

Just let them go.

Aw. Got some Cain
and Abel shit up in here.

Don't be too sorry. Baby brother
didn't really have a choice.

Some deaths
are played by [indistinct],

and some by skill.

Let them go.

I got my money.

I never want to see them again.

Bro, you going soft?

Use your head.

They just knocked off our
competitors on the Southside.

They're dead on the streets.

We don't need to do this shit.

Bro, I'm not getting bit
by these...

[sound distorting]

Baby. Tim!

Oh, my gosh.

Conner, you good?

Fuck you, Tim, he's bleeding.
[Conner] Get off.

[Tim] Gotta move.
Get the fuck off of him!

Listen!
Pettis just wants his money.

Your debt, my debt, paid.

This was not supposed to happen.

Please, I'm fighting here,
for you, with you.

Okay? We can do this.

Come on, get up, we can do this.
We got this.

[Conner] Come here, baby.
[Candace panting]


Go, go, go.

Everybody aim, when I say shoot,
keep your finger on the trigger.

don't let go
until everyone is dead.

One.

Two.
Go.

Clear! Clear!

Oh shit, y'all know
you're happy to see me.

I told you we got this.
Yeah, I can see that.

Pettis is still alive,
he's in the back.

All right.

You ready?
[Conner and Tim] Yeah.

One, two, go.

â™ª

Move.

[high-pitched ringing]
[muffled yelling]


[Mason shouting indistinctly]


I'm coming out!
Hands, hands, hands!

Let me see your fucking hands!


This is the piece of shit
that's causing all the trouble?

Yeah.
Piece of shit?

I deal not in my worth,
in yours.

Yeah, but you kill your own.

You killed Joaquin.

Don't you fucking preach to me.

This country
is built on fucking crime,

fucking settlers.
Slavery, thieves.

Forbes family got rich
off of trading opium.

You know what
they make with opium? Heroin.

And then they put
politicians in there

to make it illegal
to protect their wealth.

Every day in this country,
they seize drug money.

You think they burn that shit?
Hell fucking no.

You a fucking drug dealer
or a history teacher,

you hypocrite mother fucker?
Why am I hypocrite?

Because I make money
same way white folks do?

And help my community? Huh?
Yeah.

I'll fucking shoot
you in the face man.

Go ahead. Kill me.

I'll put a bullet
right through you.

Yeah. And Alston will come
down on you like hell.

Say what?

I said Alston will come down
on you like hell.

You working with Alston?

The fuck do you know?
I made that motherfucker.

Yeah, he's crooked

but at least he gave a shit
about that school

and them kids
that you fucking killed.

Alston killed those kids
he made the order,

we carried it out.
Bullshit.

Bullshit?

You think a ghost team
is running around,

not taking orders
from the brass?

You think they don't know
what the fuck is happening?

Are you stupid?

soldier boy. Prove it.

"Prove it." I ain't gonna prove
a motherfucking thing to you.

I got the gun, I'm gonna take
him down and probably you too.

You ain't got shit on me.

I don't leave loose ends.

Let me tell you
something about Alston.

He's been
fucking stealing from us.

He's been stealing from you.

Most of all, he's been stealing
from those kids for a long time.

I'm a lot of things.
I ain't a liar.

How the fuck do you think
he got reelected?

With my fucking money
is how he got elected.

Maybe it's time
we steal from him.

We?

There ain't no we.

I'm not with you,
you're not with me...

Captain. I don't trust
this fucking guy.

Connolly, what choice do you
fucking have?

You sound crazy as shit.
That ain't happening.


And we'll go get it.

What the fuck
do I look like to you, huh?

My knowledge, my rules.

How do you know all this?

Been clocking Alston for years.

Always had a Plan B.

He won't move his money
again for another six months.

He'll have his crew there
before the bank opens at 6:30.

That gives us a two-hour
window starting 30 minutes ago.

Without a doubt.
Yeah, why not?

Y'all ain't wearing

I do everything in style.

Why are you the first face
I'm seeing right now?

I've been looking at the chief.

You gotta be fucking kidding me.

Stuff doesn't add up.
What doesn't add up

is you worrying about

Get your head in the game.

Enough, Reynolds.

Do you hear me?
Enough.

I'm gonna put a bullet

Surveillance without us?
Why did you get in my car?

Why is the hearse
sitting at the bank?

And why do you care, Alston?

'Cause I'm the fucking boss,
man.

Why are you sitting
in front of this bank,

the only bank
that's not open yet,

and moving money
at the same time?

I don't like your tone.
I don't like your stealth act.

And I don't like key witnesses
dying under your custody.

And I don't like
feeling like my boss

is more concerned
about himself than justice.
