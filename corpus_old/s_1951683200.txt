You said you saw her die!

I didnt said that.

You did. You said you saw
her die. You did.

But i didnt use those words.

This is.. i dont know..
Its confusing, you know?

Its very hard for you to
imagine you know?

Its too hard to explain.

Try to explain it dad!
Try!

What do you want me to say?
I thought i saw mom.. Die.

I wouldn`t have told you that.
I was sure.

Look guys. Im not sure
whats happening here.

But its good. Ok.
Thats the point. Mom is alive.

I want to see her!

There is no question sir.
She has the virus. she`s infected.

Why isn`t she showing
any symptoms?

I dont know.
Speculate.

Genetic abnormality which access
some sort of natural immunity.

But the virus is still in her blood.
And its still alive.

Technically she is not immun.
She`s a carrier.

Are you saying she has
the ability to infect others?

Yes sir. Absolutely.

If this woman have natural
ammunity she incredibly valuable.

Her blood can contain the key
to a vaccine even a cure.

Alice.

Hey baby.

Im so sorry.

I was scared.

I shouldn`t have ran away.

I was scared.

Please forgive me.

<i>So what do we do?</i>

<i>I mean im not sitting around

<i>If we take one step
out of that door..</i>

<i>If the infected dont get us,
the snipers will.</i>

<i>But you dont have a
choice my friend.</i>

<i>By now its dark out there.</i>

<i>Snipers can see you through
thier night scopes.</i>

<i>At least you have limited
cover from the infected.</i>

But if you wanna wait for sun up.
Then you are good as dead.

Who are you?
