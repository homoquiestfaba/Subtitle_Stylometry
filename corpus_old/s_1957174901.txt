Native language]


The kingdom of bhandar
Yesterday

Detonated its first
Underground nuclear device,

Sending shock waves
Through the middle east.

Bhandar's brash violation

Of the nuclear
Nonproliferation treaty

Drew vehement criticism

From bhandar's avowed
Enemy and neighbor,

The small nation of ayazad.

Ayazad and bhandar have been
Engaged in a 10-year dispute

Over border territory

That has resulted
In numerous clashes

And thousands
Of casualties.

Bhandar's actions,

According to ayazad
Foreign minister ali al-alyaman

Will force ayazad to detonate
A nuclear device of its own

To ensure its sovereignty
And equality in the region.

International peace-keeping
Force security council

Met today
And voted unanimously

To deploy border patrols
To the disputed territories

 To survey the area
 For violations.

This unfortunate deterioration
Of relations in the area

Could not possibly
Benefit anyone.

I beg to differ...

Fool.

Tamil--my son.

Our village
Is not far.

How'd your boy know
We'd cut through here today?

A desert speaks,
Tamil listen.

Mmm. Born tracker,
Right?

Like father, like son.

[speaking
Native language]

You think you could
Swing us around them?

Not in this box.

Right, then...have a go
At budging the beast.

Move the camel,
Please.

Move the camel.

Arrrrr-aah!

Uhh! Aah!

Aah!

Aaaah!

Are you still with me?

Oh, no, don't--

You say don't die,
I promise i'll puke

What's left of my guts
Right over your sandals.

Can you drive us?

I would, but...

The only thing holding
My insides in is my elbows.

Don't worry.

I'll drive.

This weren't our doing...

But we came through it,
And it's done.

So get us back.

Remember your boy.


You wanted
To see me, sir?

James. Yes.
Have a seat.

Sorry to send this
Your way,

But it can't be
Helped, i'm afraid.

Sir?

Like to send a small
Recon party out,

And your name
Came up on rotation.

Seems we've lost contact
With our patrol

Which went out
2 days ago.

Could be anything--
Mechanical breakdown,

Radio failure.

In any event...we need
To fetch 'em home.

Very good, sir.

I'll start
Putting a team together,

And we can be outta here
Before nightfall.

No, james. I have
Got the duty officer

Assembling and briefing
Your crew as we speak.

In your lead patrol

You'll have
A medical officer,

A fine local tracker,

Sergeants nichols
And morton.

Morton?

But, sir, he's--

He's an angry man.

James, i know about your
Difficulties with morton,

But he was
A good soldier once.

Ex-delta force like his
Friend sergeant nichols.

Yes, sir.

The border situation
Is explosive.

One ill-timed
Incident

Can blow us
All to paradise.

I understand, sir.

Of course.

And, uh...

Godspeed, james.

All right. M-16.
You got 12 clips per.

Glocks, .9 mil,
6 clips per.

Det cord, c-4,
Fragmentation,

Smoker, and tear.

Anything else
You need, sir?

Just
Some warm targets.

When do i get
The combination?

You don't.

I'm weapons desk man
On this mission.

Regrettably.

And what happens

If we tangle
With unfriendlies?

If we encounter resistance,
You'll be the first to know.

Captain, i, uh...

Daddy wouldn't give him
The keys to the car.

What's up, sergeant?

You're going in
Without eye in the sky?

That's affirmative.
This is strictly a no-fly zone.

No air recon?

Adapt and improvise.

Isn't that
The delta force motto...

If you can recall?

Start proving it,
Sergeant.

You're a brave man
Turning your back on me.

An old desert trick--
Face away from hot wind.

Captain.

Youssef al'banir,
Your tracker.

You find these devices
Successful?

Stabilizing influence.

Buffer force.
Peace keepers.

 It doesn't matter
 What they call us.

It all comes down
To this--men in cages.

Captain wellford,

Man...build such cages.

Does he not properly
Belong inside?

Huh? Ha ha ha ha.

So you've been
Thoroughly briefed

On the terrain.

It's my country,
Captain.

Well, i'm looking
For my medical officer.

You haven't seen him
By any chance, have you?

Medical officer erickson
Reporting, sir.

Sorry to be late.
I only just arrived.

Diana.

How'd you get here?

Like everybody else,
I suppose by rising

To the level
Of my incompetency.

Few of us
Choose to be here.

I can do the job,

But if you feel
My presence

Compromises your team,
I'll understand.

No, no, not at all.
I think we can manage.

We can keep it
Friendly, can't we?

Yeah, sure.

Besides, we'll always
Have paris, huh?

We never had paris.

It was 2 miserable,

Freezing months
In bucharest.

It's funny.
Felt like paris to me.

Erickson:
Beautiful, isn't it?

This looks like a piece
Of hell if you ask me.

You just don't
Know the desert

Like i do.

I was born here.

Sorry.

I also grew up
In a country like this.

My father was
A mining engineer.

I'm sorry for you,
Too, then.

Wellford: malibu's
More to his liking.

Youssef:
Ha ha ha.

Youssef:
Slowly, captain.

Youssef: slowly.

Nichols: captain!

Wellford: mortar fire!

Soldier, background:
Fire! Fire!

I'm getting the ammo!

No! We make a run
For it.

I'm not running from
No camel jockey!

Wellford:
All right, sergeant!

It's a mine field!

What the hell are we
Doin' in a mine field?!

We've got no choice!

Stand and fight!

Maybe we should take
A vote on this one,

Captain.

No!

Captain?

How well do you
Know this area?

It's a mine field!

That's not what i asked.
You scouted it, right?

If you are asking

If i know
Where the mines are,

Sort of,
But not at night.

Get out.

What?

Get out.
Into the cage!

Come on!

Hurry up, youssef.

Allah
Be merciful.

Go.

Youssef: wait!

Hit the brake!

Wait!

I must walk...

Where i can
Feel my way.


Nichols: they're
Getting closer, sir.

Ah--ah!

Wellford:
Youssef, hurry!

Youssef!
It's too dangerous.

Get back in the jeep!
Come on!

Ok. It's about 100 feet
To the finish line.

Punch it, nichols.

Say again, sir?

Come on, let's go!

Morton: come on, bro!
You been there before!

Morton: whoo!

Saaid.

Is he ok?

It's just
A surface wound,

But i'll monitor it.

How's that radio?

Everyone else
All right?

I prefer
The camel.

I'm sure you do.


You son
Of a bitch!

Aah! Aah!

Why don't you just
Line us up and shoot us?!

The day's young,
Sergeant.

Aah!

We coulda died
Back there!

But you didn't.

Tell that to the guys
You lost in the second jeep!

They were hit
By mortar fire.

Even if they were
Armed to the hilt,

It wouldn't
Have mattered.

It matters to me.

What now, captain?

We've detoured,

But we push on.

Sir?

After all this,
Do you really believe

We're gonna find those
Poor bastards alive?

After all this,

I really believe
We should try.

Youssef:
Go left, captain.

Left, left, left.

Erickson: what is it?

This route,
It takes us too far south.

Any ideas?

We can cut through
The city of aramis.

I don't see
Any city.

Youssef:
Not on the map,

But it is very,
Very old city.

It's a ruins,
Long abandoned.

But don't worry,
Captain.

If i scale
The canyon,

 I can find
 The path.

Don't worry.

Stop here.

Nichols: what do
You think, captain?

Ok, nichols.
Shut her down.

Morton: get down!

Go! Back it up!
Back it up!

Go! Go! Go!
Back! Back!

Back up! Back!

Morton:
They're everywhere!

Go! Go! Go! Go!

Go!

Incoming!

Aaah!

Nichols: they're hit,
Captain, they're hit!

[all shouting]

Go!

Morton: incoming!

Nichols:
We're boxed in, sir!

Nichols:
I'm out! I'm out!

Punch it! Go!

I don't think
We're gonna make it!

This is never
Gonna work!

Aaah!

Morton: whoo!

 Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

Sergeant.
Stop, stop.

There.

Aramis.

It is a secret
Holy city.

A perfect place
To hide out.

I didn't join up to hide out
In some dead city.

You didn't join up.

You're here because your own
Army couldn't control you.

Learn from it,
Sergeant.

Let's go.

I don't get it.

Why would they ambush us?

Maybe we were
Nearing a test site.

Which means we
Could be sitting

At ground zero.

Unarmed.

Nicholas: kinda
Makes you want to check

That expiration date
Stamped on your ass, huh?

This should
Increase your confidence

In your shelf-life a bit.

One clip?

We're under strict orders
Not to engage.

This is still a recon
And rescue operation.

What do you think this is,
Some kind of game?

Hey, come on, bro.
Sergeant morton with one clip?

Armies have surrendered
For less.

Guess i have done
A little damage in my day.

That's precisely why
You'll only fire on my orders.

He is a wild child,
Captain,

But believe me,

When it's time
To rock 'n' roll...

There's nobody you want
More on your team.

I've had a gut full
Of rock 'n' roll...

A lifetime's worth.

I should probably
Go check on him.

Youssef.

Scout anything?

We're alone.

This is a land of ghosts.

Mmm?

No.

The days
Are no different.

The world turns.

The men chase mad dreams
Across its space.

 The view
 Is always the same.

You're strange.

[erickson giggles]

[erickson laughs]

[erickson
And wellford laugh]

Sounds like the captain's
Gettin' some.

Aw, man.

[erickson laughs]

Come trouble tomorrow,
We'll be gettin' ours.

Yeah, well, i wish i was
Gettin' mine right now.

[erickson laughs]

[men chatter]

Alone in the land
Of ghosts, huh?

[men working]

Wellford:
How the bloody hell

Did they slip
Past you, youssef?

Puma has given them
The footsteps of a cat.

That's the biggest
Pile of bullshit

As i've ever heard.

Look out for cats
Next time, all right?

Unh!

[men speaking

[hammer banging]

[hammer banging]

That one.

She will die of fright
At your first satisfaction.

Ivan is waiting.

Ivan:
And welcome as ever.

I prosper
With each visit.

Tell me, loyal friend.

What do you have
For me today?

Oh, allow me
To introduce

Chief customs
Director abu nimer,

A loyal
And devoted servant

Of his native
Ayazad, and yet

A man still
Sensitive enough

To understand
The special needs

Of small
Businessmen.

Speak.

A second
Ipf convoy.

Jabbar has taken steps.

2 attempts,
2 failures.

If jabbar cannot destroy
A peace-keeping convoy,

He must surely fail
In his main objective.

Besides, it is
No concern of mine.

I am but a humble
Businessman.

I supply the wood
And the nails.

It is for jabbar
To build the coffins.


Will you dine?

Uh, my unexplained absence
May arouse suspicion.

It is, perhaps, imprudent,

Given the delicacy
Of our relationship.

Then let's do business...

Before this tender toe

Dries out
Beneath my desert sun.

Ah. Well,
Khalu jabbar.

What a pleasure.

Tell me, will you
Dine with me,

Or a drink, perhaps?

 Oh, oh.

Oh.

Forgive my cultural
Insensitivities.

Alcohol in paradise,
Perhaps.

What is he doing here?
My government

Does not recognize
Or sanction this colonel.

Take care for the way
You use my rank.

It is earned each day.

He is a renegade,
A brigand.

Gentlemen,
Let's put aside

These ideological
Differences

And discuss
Business.

And what is our business
This time?

Surely the colonel
Has guns and bullets enough

To satisfy even
His appetite for slaughter.

You are
A perceptive man.

How would you like
To be a rich one?

How rich?

Delightfully.

Now, the device

Will come across
The caspian sea

From
Turkmenistan.

The device
From turkmenistan...

Sounds more dangerous
Than profitable.

Sharp as the blade
Of muhammad.

For him?

The republic of ayazad
Cannot be implicated

In the smuggling
Of a nuclear device.

But the wrong element
Like this?

Our goals are the same.

Ayazad will again
Have dominance and glory

Before the bhandari
Blasphemers.

I, uh, i don't know
About this.

My dear director,

You are far
Too intelligent a man

To be confined
And shackled

To a bureaucratic post.

You must
Open your mind

To the greater
Possibilities of life.

There are many factors
To consider.

Allow me to add
Another factor. Sonya.

10% down payment.

10%.

As i said,

Delightfully rich.

Now, this
Initial payment

Will be in your
Hands just as soon

As the full
Documentation

Is in ours.

As long as we
Understand each other.

I guarantee entry,
Not safe passage.

Either way,
I get my money.

And now, if you
Would be good enough

To have someone
Return me to the city.

Of course.
Of course.

Travel safely,
My good friend.

Thank you.

Tell me. This insect...

Can he be trusted?

It is not his loyalty
I count on.

Youssef?

Nomads.
Displaced tribesmen,

Or, uh--

Another welcome wagon
Courtesy of jabbar?

Perhaps, for once,
He might just surprise me.

[men shouting
In native language]

Wellford: easy, guys.

Come on.
Let's go earn our pay.

[men shouting
In native language]

Stand down,
Sergeants.

Damn.

All right,
Let's go.

No. We're not here
To fight.

Yeah, don't tell us,
Tell them!

Mark your target.

I'm still in command
Of this truck!

Yeah? We started with 3!

James.

[all shouting
In native language]

I'm not goin' home
In a box! Not for you.

Captain.

No!

[man screams]



[shouting
In native language]

[woman crying]

[woman shouting
In native language]

[shouting
In native language]

She ask, "why is
My husband dead?"

"we need food,
Medicine."

"the fever sweeps
For the children."

[woman cries out
In native language]

"you're not here
To help?"

[woman shouting, sobbing]

[man chanting]

Beautiful.

Huh?

Now, you come for an
Instrument of justice.

Precise, compact,
And remorseless.

Like the young master
Himself.

I offer this moron

A path
Of glorious vengeance

Against mighty enemies,

And he insults me
With trinkets.

You must have 2 times
This and a bit more,

Then it is yours.

We will find a way
To guide the aim

Of the small warrior.

[men chattering
In native language]

[speaking
Native language]

[speaking
Native language]

[speaking
Native language]

[chattering
In native language]


[shouting
In native language]

I have the preliminary
Documentation

And the authenticator
And sequencing codes

So important
To your colonel jabbar.

The money first.

When?

Not until i see
The rest of my money.

In any event,
I will not be able

To take possession of the device
Until the customs office opens

Tomorrow morning at 5:00.

[speaking
Native language]

[speaking
Native language]

[speaking native language]

[speaking
Native language]

Our customs director
Abu nimer.

[speaking
Native language]

Please be seated.

You know who i am?

Al-alyaman,

Minister of defense
Of bhandar.

So you know
It is worth my life

To be discovered here
Up on ayazad soil.

Yes.

General fayad has briefed me
Regarding your communication

Of an offer to re-route

An illicit device
Bound for your country.

This venture
Was outside the range

Of your legitimate authority.

Hence, it is of some interest
To my country

To know the identity
Of your master.

My client is
Colonel khalu jabbar.

You suspect duplicity
From jabbar

Regarding your transaction?

Is this why you seek
A second benefactor?

Not particularly.

Mmm. The duplicity
Begins with you.

So, what would you
Ask of us, peddler?

Simple acknowledgment

Of this humanitarian mission
For world peace on my part

And whatever
Financial considerations

Such a selfless act
Might engender

From the grateful people
Of bhandar, of course.

You would betray
Your country for money?

You control
The device now?

I do.

Triple your present
Arrangements with jabbar,

And, uh...

Safe passage to
The nation of your choice.

Done and done.

Uh...

May i leave now?

Please do.

And, uh...

They took my...

Do not worry.

But barring admonishment,
Director abu nimer,

Do not confuse me
With your rabid dog jabbar.

 I will have this device
 Within 24 hours...

Or i will have your head.

[door closes]




[neck breaking]


Wellford: dead end.

I am sorry, captain.

You're right.

It's a dead end.

We'll just get a map

And find a way down.

It wasn't
Your fault.

Yeah, you're
Bloody right it wasn't.

He's supposed to know
The desert like the--

Stop it.

What?

You gave them
The weapon,

So now it's all on you.
Is that it?


I made a mistake,

And a man's dead
Because of it.

No. You made
A decision.

Sergeant morton
Made the mistake.

Yeah...

But it happened
On my watch.

Captain, captain?

Please, please.

Please!



You took it away.

Just got a little
Heavy for him.

Perhaps it's a miracle.

Well, it's about time.

Nichols: so much for
The engine trouble theory.

Youssef.

What do you make
Of this?

Bhandar nationals

Without question.

Bhandaras?

Now what would they
Be doing in ayazad?

And why ambush
A peace-keeping patrol?

It is
A show of force.

They hungry for war.

From what i've seen,
Both countries share

In that appetite.

They are the enemies
Of my people.

People of ayazad.

I do not pretend
To understand

Their insanity.



[speaking native language]


These now
Are the weapons.

[speaking native language]

Youssef!

That's enough.

I am sorry, captain.

He's a dirty desert child.

You cannot expect--

Youssef,
What's he saying?

It's nonsense.

He claims his father
Was the tracker

Killed on this mission.

It is because of you
My father is dead!

You, you, you!

[youssef speaking
Native language]

He has sworn revenge.

He has included us...

Among the condemned.

Perhaps we are.

Youssef: there are many
Child vipers like him

In the army
Of khalu jabbar.

What's he saying
About jabbar?

[tamil shouting]

He want to give us
The information

Important to jabbar

In trade
For his freedom.

Wellford: what kind
Of information?

This information, captain.

You are fluent in arabic
Now, sergeant nichols?

No, i can't read a word.

You see,
On the back page here,

These 4 double rows
Of numbers.

I may be wrong,
And i hope i am,

But they form
The matrix

For sequencing
And authenticator codes.


Well, you know...

For a nuclear detonation.

I am my father's son!

Ahh, hush!

[speaking
Native language]

I don't know what the hell
You're talkin' about, kid,

But i'd love
To hear about it.



We all make
Mistakes, mike.

Negative, sir.

We're monitoring
All frequencies,

But so far we--

So we sit tight
And keep listening.

Do you think they're
With the first patrol, sir?

I don't know what
To think, corporal.

That team soldiered...

You know what i mean?

I guess what
I'm saying is, sir,

I'd like to put
My name in the hat

When h.q. Authorizes
Another search.

There won't be
Another team, corporal.

Sir?

Headquarters felt
Wellford's team

Was ill-advised.

Whatever
Those poor bastards

Are up against
Out there,

They're up
Against it alone.

Wellford:
If the boy is right,

That means jabbar is
About to take delivery

Or has in his possession
A nuclear device.

It makes sense if you
Think about it, captain.

That massacred
Patrol back there--

Can't have any
Snoopin' around

If you're waitin'
For a hot delivery.

Youssef: why would
The bhandari force

Want to keep
The ipf patrol

From stopping jabbar?
Why?!

You don't believe that
Was a bhandari unit,

Do you, nichols?

Nah, it's too pat.

Bits of i.d.

Transport weapons
Unrecovered--

What kind
Of covert raid

Would be
That sloppy?

Tamil said that
The cave very close,

Maybe 3 hours out.

And we are the only
Ones who know.

No radios. No recon.

 No air support.

Wellford: look, guys.

I know we're a rescue
And relief operation

And our objective
Is peace,

But there's
A big bomb out there.

I say we take care
Of business.

Youssef: insanity.


You are speaking insanity!

We have no other choice.
Besides, i believe what

The kid's saying is true.

Lies! Fabrications!

Why are you
So certain?

In here, i feel it!

Allah, be merciful.

It is a gift.

Morton: funny thing about
That gift of yours.

You take us
Down into a canyon,

Next thing we know
We're face-to-face

With jabbar's rockets.

And the dead city
You took us to--

We wake up
Right in the middle

Of times square.

What?!

Come to think of it,

We've done enough
Doubling back

And rerouting to
Slow us to a crawl.

I'm not listening
To this.

You have been
Selling the kid

As a spy
Pretty hard.

Well, maybe
We do have a spy.

Well, maybe
It's you.

Please.

My friends.

Youssef al'banir...

Is not...

Youssef al'banir...

Is not a spy!

Youssef al'banir...

Youssef al'banir...

Is just...

A terrible tracker.

But i am the worst
Tracker in all ayazad.

Oh, i'm gonna get
Myself killed for you.

He'll be an incentive.

If i'm guiding,

We may never
Find that cave.


[speaking native language]

Aah!

Ahh.

[distant men
Speaking native language]

Unh!

[man speaking
Native language]

[second man speaking
Native language]

Erickson: the device
Isn't a missile.

Well, that certainly
Ups the stakes.

Morton:
If we drop any lower,

We're gonna look like
A pair of cheap chandeliers.

 Where's the captain
 And sergeant morton?

Let's find out.

[intercom
Tapping morse code]

[intercom static
Receiving morse code]

What are you saying?

I'm giving him
Our position,

Asking for theirs.

[intercom static]

[intercom static]
What does he say?

He says...

To look up.

[intercom

[intercom static]

And that?

A new cable.

Withdraw. No doubt.

He says to forget
About them.

Trash the toy.

[intercom

[intercom static code]

Wellford:
He said hang in there.

Very funny.


Can you work that?

What? D.u.c. Sweeper?

14 parallel processors
On a semi-c?

Yeah.

It's just like
Makin' love.

Unh!

Ahh!

Jabbar's tripped
The sequence initiators.

The warhead's activated.

How long
Before it detonates?

24 minutes.

But you can
Shut it down, yes?

Not from this terminal.

It's got
An inhibitor safeguard.

Someone must have
Alternative codes

On another computer
Somewhere.

Sergeant nichols,
You must hurry

If we are to plant
These explosives

And be away!

We're not going anywhere!

I should hope not.

At least not
Until we've talked.

Now you really must tell me
All about yourselves.

[guns dropping]


I get so few visitors
These days.

Aah!

Enough!

Come.

Come, come, come.

[men speaking
Native language]

Cocktails, 6:00 sharp.

Make yourselves at home.

You are almost
Too pathetic to shoot.

Almost.

Answer a dead man's
Question?

No.

No! Aah!

Youssef!


[nearby men shouting]

How peculiar.

You're gonna be ok.

That missile,

It's a short-range haft.

I do not hear any question.

The nearest bhandar target
Of any significance

Is 300 miles from here
At least...

While the haft has a maximum
Range of only 186 miles.

Yes.

So what am i missing?

The missile isn't
Aimed at bhandar.

It's aimed at your
Own country ayazad.

A small price we must pay.

Save your bullets,
Jabbar.

Allow them to live
With their failure

A little longer.

[men speaking
Native language]

That was a bold move,
Youssef.

Oh, no, my friend.

If i die,

Ayazad loses...

Its worst tracker.

But if you die...

My country
Loses...its future.

He's going to bomb
His own country.

It's insane.

Not to jabbar.

He will deceive
The people of ayazad.

And the great powers
Of the world

Will release a call
For jihads.

How is he?
Is he gonna make it?

Before you promise this,

I should tell you,

I have always been lucky
In these matters.

[hammering and
Voices chattering]


[man shouting
In native language]

Youssef.

Captain.

You are a member of

The international peace-keeping
Expeditionary force.

You may not die
Without prior permission

From your officer
In command.

[voices chatter]

I have not given you
Permission.

Do you understand?

Yes, captain.

Sir, we have
Another problem.

Sit tight.
I'll be right back.


[man shouting
In native language]

Let's get
A move on, gang.

This place is going
Off in 15 minutes.

We can't.

The warhead's
Been activated.

We're just gonna
Let that thing blow

And get the hell
Out of here.

No. If the missile
Blows here,

The warhead's
Inhibitor safeguard

Just sets it off
That much sooner.

We've gotta
Get to jabbar.

He's got
Another computer

With the authenticator
Codes i need

To shut that thing down.

So if we get you
To jabbar's computer,

You can deactivate
The warhead?

I can
Turn that thing

Into a $5 million
Paperweight.

Ok, diana, you get
Youssef out of here.

We'll make our way
To jabbar.

No! Look, i don't think
I can manage youssef

On my own without
Getting us caught.

Ok.

Then it's one big
Happy family.

12 minutes
And 30 seconds anyway.

Youssef.

I think
That maybe you--

Captain, i should
Like to remain here...

With your permission.

Permission granted.

You cover our backs,
Friend.

No one shall pass.


[klaxon blares]

Have you really
Thought this through?

[klaxon blares]

System's down.

Diana:
Are we ok?

It'll take a few minutes
To re-initialize.

We'll be ok.

I do not think so.

Ivan: sonya...

My sonya.

You never cease to surprise
And delight me.

Filthy money grubber.

You've served your purpose.

Did you really think i would
Leave you free to operate?

To perhaps deal
With my enemies?

As a student of chess,

I should think such strategy
Would be obvious.

My pawn becomes queen.

Knight takes queen.

[clicks empty]

Aah!


Aah!

[men shouting
In distance]

Nichols: you all right?

I'm ok.

[gunfire, shouting,
Klaxon blaring]

Stay with nichols.

He'll need you
If they get past us.

Youssef: captain!

If we have 5 minutes
Left to live,

Who'd you want
To spend it with?

I don't know.

Ask me again in 6.

Captain,
What if i go out?

Please help me.
The missile will explode!

Youssef!

I did it.
I did it!

 I did it!

I did it.
The warhead's deactivated.


Brothers,
Listen to me--

Our work's
Finished, sir.

Not yet.

The charge i set
Goes off in 2 minutes.

Let's go!


[speaking native language]

Sir, we've monitored
A violent tremor

In the cave region
Of the ayazad desert.

Natural?

It's an explosion,
Sir.

A massive one.

I got a bad feeling
About this, colonel.

I ain't going home in a box!

Not for you.

Well, maybe
We do have a spy.

I supply the wood
And the nails.

It is for jabbar
To build the coffins.

If i'm guiding,
We may never find

That cave.
