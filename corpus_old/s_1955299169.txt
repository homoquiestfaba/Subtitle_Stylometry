Huh!

Hey!

Hey!

Huh!

Right, yeah!

Whoo!

Hey, melea.

Go, girl!

Whoo!

Whoo!

Whoa!

Yeah!

Whoo!

<i>Ow.!</i>

Check her out! Yeah! Yeah!

Ha!

Shake it! Yes!

Ha! Ha!

Come on, shake it!

Whoo!

Yeah!

Yeah.

You and your drama, Nadine.

Do you always have to
make such an entrance?

Lam nothing if not dramatic.

How long have
you known me for?

Well, since our mothers
grew up here together,

I would have to say
before we were born.

Mm-hmm. And that's how
it's gonna stay.

From womb to tomb, baby!

I know that's right.
Got this tonight.

You guys are crazy.

And you love it.
Yeah, I do. I do.

You know, being around them, it makes
me miss being with someone special.

And, baby, you are so on my...

Okay. You...

You need to not touch me. I'm not
trying to hear that. On!

Yo, give it up,lasen
whatever, man.

I'm ready to go, anyway.

Yeah, we should go, too.
We have class in the morning.

You go ahead.

I'm gonna hang outwith Nadine
for a little while.

Come on,
I'll see you tomorrow.

Don't be too late.
I won't.

Bye, ladies.
Bye.

Have fun. Not too much.

Yeah, he's a good one.

Maybe I should come to your fancy
university and snag me a cutie, too.

Been trying to tell you.

Girl, I have a job.

I'm just saying, you have other
talents besides teaching.

You can't let all of this go to waste.

Oh, no, it won't,
'cause, um...

<i>See that guy at the 'oar'? Yeah.</i>

Yeah, well, he's about to pay
for my drinks all night. Oh-ho!

Can I get you something?

I'm not drinking.

You know, meme,
we give the people a show.

The least they can do
is buy our refreshments.

Have fun.

It's time for a real battle.

What?

Come on, guys.
Let's kick some ass.

Yeah!

Yes!

All right.

Who are they?

I have no idea.

Okay, you gotta
take this for me.

Let's do this.

Yeah.

Yeah!

Come on, please.

<i>Not tonight, guys.</i>

<i>Security, security!
Take this out.</i>

Damn. Every time.
This ain't over.

Oh, we're just
getting started.

Yo! Hey, hey!

What are you doing? Stay out of it.
Hey!

Let's go. What are they
even fighting for?

I told you!

It wasn't
that big a deal.

Things just get a little crazy
between cliques there sometimes.

I knew I shouldn't
have left you alone.

I wasn't alone. I was
with Nadine and my crew.

Your crew?
Yeah.

Just 'cause you spent
your summers growing up here,

does not make you from here.

And you need to relax.

Nothing bad happened.

In fact,
i learned some new moves

from this girl that I battled.

She was dope.

I think I might
use some of the moves

in my Romeo and Juliet thesis.

You have such
a one-track mind.

Is it always
about dance with you?

No, occasionally,
it's about you.

Occasionally?
Mm-hmm.

Oh, okay.

Well, you know, I'm busy.
Got a lot of stuff to do.

You're so busy.

Are you too busy for this?

Nope. I'm late for class.

Okay, cool.

Oh, you have some new tracks
for me later, right?

Yes, captain.

Stupid.

<i>Five, six...
Five, six, seven, hit it.</i>

Yes!

Yeah!

Whoo!

Go, go!

Yeah!

Yeah!

Hey!

Hold on. I need to take this.

Yeah?

Yo, melea, that was hot.

And I'm gonna need you
to run it by me again later.

Why? You jealous that
i got some moves you don't?

He is.
Hey.

What?

Melea. Administrator
wants to see you.

So, go.

Okay, guys, let's take it
from the top.

Do I have to tell you twice?

Let's go.

Melea, whatever it is,
we'll figure something out.

There's nothing
to figure out, Erik.

I'm getting kicked
out of school,

and I won't be able to
present my thesis project.

It's our thesis project, and
I'm just as upset as you are.

No, you're not.

Come over,
and we'll talk about it.

Please? I can't.
I'll call you later.

So, what's the problem?

My tuition is overdue, and i
can't return to class until it's paid.

And what about
your scholarships?

Not enough.

And you weren't
going to tell me?

I mean, you already let me stay here.
You put food on the table.

The least l can
do is handle this.

Melea, you know I will do
anything to help you.

But you have to talk to me.

Well, you know I promised mom
that I would get my degree.

Ever since I started doing this
Romeo and Juliet thesis...

Phew.

I thought it was the perfect
way to honor her memory.

I'm pretty sure that giving up is
a lousy way to honor your mother.

You're probably right.

And I'm pretty sure
you're gonna beat this.

What makes you so sure?

I screwed everything
up so much already.

Well, you're a smart young lady.
And that's important.

But mostly, you're very
stubborn and thick-headed.

Gee, thanks.

I think we need to do less
talking and more eating.

<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

I'm gonna get a job,
figure it out.

H ow?

I don't know.
I'll find a space.

I'll mount it myself.

I don't know why it's
so important to you.

'Cause I have
something to say, Erik.

<i>'Cause Romeo and
Juliet hasn't been done</i>

in the way that
i want to do it.

And dance is the way I speak.

I want to be able
to tell this story,

and have it reach
out to people.

It's my mom's favorite play, and
i want to honor her with it.

You will.

Why does it have
to be right now?

I mean, I get it. I'm the
same way with my music,

but I think you need to focus on
money and getting back into school,

and then worry
about your show.

I'm gonna figure
out a way to do both.

And costumes, and sets.
It's not cheap.

How're you gonna
afford all that?

Ticket sales, eventually. Oh!

Um... and you're still gonna
help me with the music, right?

You're serious?

I'm dead serious.

But if you pull this off,
then, yes, I'll do the music.

Great.

Now, all I have
to do is find a job,

so I can afford paper to print tickets.

Wish me luck.
Yeah, you don't need it.

And look, if all else fails, i
mean, at least you got Romeo.

You can
be so corny sometimes.

Yeah, that was corny. All
right, I'm out of here. Bye.

Hello.
My name is melea Martin.

I'm a hip-hop choreographer,

and I'm interested in interviewing
for your open position.

<i>Hip-hop? Oh, no. We only
teach ballet and jazz here.</i>

Okay, I see you. Get it.

Oh, you like what you see?

Come and get some.

Oh, it's like that? Okay.

Whoo!

Oh, crystal, you do not want
to mess with my friend.

Melea is no joke.

Yeah, right.

Okay, everybody,
get back to class now.

I don't want
anyone being late.

Go hit those books
like you hit those moves.

Zam, you, too.

I've seen you before.
You are good.

Thank you.

Wow! You really impressed him.

That was his version of rambling.
He never says anything.

He seems like a cool kid.

Oh, he is.
He's just hard to reach.

Hmm.

What are you doing today?

Oh, just a job search, but
they don't have anything here.

Yeah, budget cuts.

Why the need for
money all of a sudden?

<i>F or school</i>

all my scholarships ran out.
And now they want cash.

Welcome to the real world.
Tell me about it.

Okay, well,
i better get inside

before my students
form a coup. Good luck.

Okay, thank you.
Call me.

All right.
Ooh, give me my phone?

Oh, shoot,
i almost forgot.

Here you are. Bye.
Thanks, girl.

Don't ever give up.

Hey, yo, check it.

What happened?
You playing hooky?

Not that
it's any of your business,

but I'm taking
a break from school.

Oh!

So, now you back in the hood.
Bumped down to our level.

For your information,
i live in this neighborhood.

I don't consider
it a bump-down.

What's your name, girl?

Was gonna ask you
the same thing.

I'm lshani.
Everybody knows me.

I'm melea.

And you should get to know me
before you judge me.

So, what? You want to have me
over for tea or something?

This girl's a trip.

Everything all right, melea?

Yeah, taariq.
We're cool.

If you're looking for friends,
go back to America,

'cause you won't
find them here.

Come on, let's go.
We got better things to do.

Yeah.
She's a waste of time.

Where to?
Bo-kaap.

Bo-kaap.

You know,
i don't need security.

Are you sure about that?

We just came here
to dance, man.

Yo, yo! 'Sup, boys?

Yo, what's up?
Boy!

Yo, what's happening?

What's up?

Yeah, go! Hit it!

Yeah!

I like your style, taariq. It's
pretty dope. I'll catch you later.

Peace,taaflq.
You guys are great.

Thank you.
Yeah! Sweet.

All right, let's do it.

You are making the best decision, Mr.
Wright.

Well, I sure hope so.

Mr. Wright.
Yes?

Oh, my goodness.
It's melea. Isn't it?

Yeah, I can't believe
you remember me.

Well, you look
just like your mother.

How's she doing?
Ls she with you?

Um, no. She passed.
About a year ago.

Oh, lord. Lam sorry.

She was one fine lady.

Yeah, she was.

Hey, I wanted to talk to you
about working here at bijou.

Is there anything i
can do around here?

Melea, you're too late.

The lady who
just left, uh, miss Lee,

she's thinking
of buying the place.

Well, you're gonna sell it?
Like, why?

Because I'm old.

And I ain't made
a dime in years.

Hey, this might sound crazy,
but can I ask you a favor?

Okay, now, close your eyes.

Step.

Don't look yet!

How can I look? Your hands
are covering my eyes.

Oh, wow!

This place is amazing.
I know, right?

Well, it needs
a lot of work, but...

Nothing a mop
and nails won't fix.

That's being optimistic.

So, are you in, for real? Phew.

'Yeah.Yeah, let's do this. Yeah?

Grab the mop.
Okay.

Perfect. And one, and two...

And one. Point your feet.

One more time.

Thank you.
Yeah, you should...

Hey.

Oh, melea,
where have you been?

Hey.

Just because
you're a dropout

doesn't mean you can't hang
with us intellects.

I promise we
won't use big words.

You're an idiot, and I've been busy.
Check this out.

<i>Romeo and Juliet? Yo,
i have to be a part of this.</i>

I was hoping you
would say that,

'cause you could
seriously rock mercutio.

Yeah, you know it.
Which one is that?

It's Romeo's friend.

He gets in between the families
and ends up getting killed.

Well, I don't want to die.

No, dude, it's a tragedy.
Everyone dies.

Oh.

How about lord capulet?

Lord'? Yeah, I'm on it.
Yes.

One more time, please.

Yo, melea!
Hey.

How's it going?
Good, how are you?

Yeah, good. Passing all right?
It's going.

You gotta see some
of these dancers, though.

I mean, look at that guy.
He is dope.

Wow!

You know that guy?
Yeah, dajon.

Whoa!

Mema, he is sick.
He's killing it.

Hey, excuse me.

<i>Damn'?</i>

Yeah, that's me.

Oh, my god. It's taj.
Boy 1; That taj?

Boy 22 hey, it's taj!
Boy 32 is that taj?

Hey, how's it going, taj?

Hey, it's taj.
Hey, man.

<i>Hey, ta},
tay over here.</i>

Erik, I found my Romeo.

His name is dajon bell.
He's from the states, and...

Look, who do you...

Oh!

Shit. Not you again.

Erik, let me
call you back.

What's this?

<i>It's a hip-hop r and j.</i>

A what?

<i>Amp-hop Romeo and Juliet.</i>

Okay, that's not just crazy,
that's stupid crazy.

What's stupid crazy?

Hey, girl. I see you're
still holding it down.

Where you been? Man, you're
all over the charts.

Yeah, good times.

Hey, I'm taj.

Melea. I know who you are.
Everyone knows who you are.

We pretty much grew up in the
same neighborhood, actually.

You're from New York? Yo,
what are you doing out here?

Going to school. Or at least I was.
It's a long story.

Uh, you out here on
tour or something?

Nah, I got a home out here. Visited
once and fell in love with the place.

So, when I'm not touring, I come
and hang out with my people.

Like lshani, here.

She's not your people. Why are
you telling her your business?

Why you throwing shade?

'Cause this crazy-ass
bitch got it in her head

<i>to do a hip-hop
Romeo and Juliet.</i>

Why I gotta be a bitch,
and a crazy-ass one at that?

Yo, don't mind lshani. All right?
She has a short fuse.

<i>But listen, that r and j,
built for hip-hop.</i>

All them rich folks
killing each other.

It's perfect.

Would you think that you
could do some music for us?

Well, I have been looking
to spread my wings a bit.

You know, get into TV, film, whatnot.
But I don't have the time.

Gimme your phone.

Here's my number.
Text me.

Come through, and if you like what
you see, please get involved.

I'll think about it.

Thanks.

Nice to meet you, melea.

Hit me later, all right? Got some
business I gotta take care of.

Just wanted to show
my face real quick.

It's bad enough you guys
hang out at our spots

and steal our moves.

Oh, yeah.

You didn't think we knew why
you college kids were there?

We're not stupid.

And you can have the dances.

But taj is off limits.
Understood?

You like him. Wow!

It's funny, because the way
that he kissed you

is the way a brother
kisses his little sister.

Think about it, lshani.

A rich and
famous guy like that

could have any girl
that he wants.

Why would he want to be
with a bully like you?

Hey,
can I fit two more?

We need
at least one more.

Hey, did you get to check out
those videos I sent you?

Oh, yeah, balcony scene.
All over it.

Okay, let's give it a shot.
Hit it, zam.

Oh, you must be Erik.

Uh, you must be Mr. Wright. You
have a beautiful theater, sir.

Well, she's seen better days.

Butsoon,
it won't be my problem.

That was great.
Okay.

Thanks, thanks.

Erik, finally.
Where have you been?

Sorry.
I got caught up at school.

What's up? I'm Erik.

Dajon. How's it going?

Good, yeah.

He's my boyfriend
and composer.

Act one, fight scene.

It's just the first take.

What's wrong?

I mean, this scene
is just not working.

Yeah.
Yeah.

What's not working?

I mean, I don't know. It's... these
kids are in rival gangs, right?

Right, right, and we should
be playing into that, right?

Well, yeah, because when their parents
find out, they're gonna freak.

Yep.

So, maybe we can
sex it up a little?

It's a love scene.

No, he might be right.
Play into the tension.

Yeah.

So, maybe, we can add something
like this, you know, like...

Like there,
and then, maybe, you know...

Mm-hmm.
Something like that.

Yeah? No, it's supposed
to be romantic.

You should do
something like this.

Okay.

All right, well,
that's not bad.

Yeah. It was...
It was perfect.

Oh, if you say so, Romeo.
Melea, let's take five.

Yeah, good idea.
Yeah, take five.

Thanks.
All right.

Take 10.

What was all that about?

What? I don't like the way
you're dancing with him.

You're jealous?

No, I'm not jealous.

Okay, maybe a little.

I'm not exactly his type.

What are you talking about?
You're everyone's type.

Not the kind of guy
that likes other guys.

Oh, right.

Ah, yes. I... I missed that.

Yeah, that's obvious.
Yeah. Sorry.

Cool. Can we get out of here? Grab
a bite or something? Anything?

I can't. I have to keep
practicing with dajon,

if I want our chemistry
to be believable, you know?

We're new partners.
Mm-hmm.

So we have to
feel each other out.

Right.

Promise after all this is over,
everything will be different.

Cool. All right.

Bye, guys.
Bye.

Ready to hit it again?
Let's do it.

<i>Hey-
hey.-</i>

what are you watching?

The ballet, for inspiration.

You know, when nureyev did
this, they applauded for 40 minutes.

Don't compare yourself. I mean,
you're doing hip-hop, right?

Yeah.

But this is a classic.
It sets the bar.

Yeah, but it
was written, when?

You have to speak
to your audience.

I mean, you got romeos and
juliets all over the flats.

You're right.

Hmm.

Hey, man.
Yo, what's cruisin', man?

Good, man.

What's up?

Why are we
here, again?

Because I want to change the
tone of our Romeo and Juliet.

I want the reality of
this place to inspire us.

We've got company.

Do you know who that is?

Yeah, I know him.
Who invited him?

Who cares?

My view just got 100% better.

Hey, I didn't know
you would make it.

I listened to that
score you sent me.

Oh, you did?

Oh, like that's not what
you wanted me to do.

I mean, I was hoping so.
Yeah, I figured.

I took a shot at that parting
scene, where you and Romeo split.

Yeah. And I came up with this.

Okay.
Yeah?

I feel it.
A'ight.

You want to try it?

Hell, yeah.

Come on.

Meleai Erik.

Erik.

Erik.

Want me to go after him?

No, it must not
have been important.

Hey- hey-

who was that?
Oh, her boyfriend.

Trouble in paradise.

Uh, yeah, I guess so.

Phew!
Nice session, yeah?

Yeah.

All right.

I'll see you tomorrow, melea.

<i>Thank you, dawn.</i>

Thank you.

Bye, guys.

Bye, ta]- .

Thank you so much for the song, taj.
It was perfect.

It's no problem. Just glad
everything worked out.

Listen,
i gotta hit a session,

but I'm having a party Saturday,
if you all wanna stop by.

I'm there.

You can apologize to your
other guests in advance,

'cause you won't be
able to resist me.

Wow, Nadine. Really?

Shush. He has a private jet.
I can come visit you.

I'm flattered,
but I'm kinda seeing someone.

Damn.
All the good ones are taken.

Hey. I'm a good one.

Ew. You're like my brother.
Don't be weird.

You two are funny.

What about you, melea?
See you at the party?

I don't know, I have
a lot to do with the show.

I don't know if I can
make it, but I'll try.

Yo, you might meet some folks
who could help you.

And your girl
lshani will be there.

That's the girl you've been telling
me about? The one we battled?

Yeah.

Now I know
i can't make it.

A'ight, come on.
She's cool.

Talks a lot of trash, but she's
going through some deep shit.

Like what?

Her little brother, Emmanuel,
was killed last year.

Some messed-up gang thing over
a fancy chain he was wearing.

I didn't realize.

Yeah, I know a lot of kids
going through the same thing.

Yeah, it's bad.

So, cut her some slack, maybe.

She could use more
good people in her life.

See ya.

Bye.

I know that look.

That's your "i want to
save the world" look.

I heard that.

It was nice.

Come in.

I had already written
music for that scene.

I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

Babe, you know i
can't do this without you.

You sure seemed like
you were doing fine earlier.

You know what taj
brings to this project.

Yeah, credibility. I know, I get it.
He's an established artist.

Yeah, but that doesn't change
how I feel about you.

It just seems like
the only thing you care about

<i>is this Romeo and Juliet show.</i>

Well, it is important to me.

Especially without school, and
being where my mom grew up,

seeing how it is here,
it makes me feel obligated.

Yeah, so you want
me to play the role

of the understanding
boyfriend?

If you don't mind.
Okay. Yeah.

Love you when you're crazy.

I've had plenty of
practice for that.

So, we should be okay.
Thanks.

Besides, there's one thing I know
i can do way better than taj.

Really? What is that?

Dance.

<i>And five, six, seven, eight.</i>

Bring the energy
up, guys. Ready?

Yes, laser!

Go for it, Nadine.

Okay, break it up,
break it up.

Stop the music.
Stop the music.

Look, I like you guys' attitude,
but let me ask you something.

Do you really know
what this play is about?

No.

That's what I thought.
Sit down.

All right, so I'm gonna
give you the lowdown.

So, the capulets
are Juliet's parents.

They don't get along
with Romeo's parents.

You guys hate each other. It's kind
of like rival gangs in the flats.

<i>Everyone knows
the basic plot of the story.</i>

<i>Boy and girl fall in love,
and die in the end.</i>

<i>But it's so much
more than that.</i>

<i>It's a story of forbidden love surrounded
by violence, revenge, and death.</i>

<i>People died basically for no reason,
just like here in the flats.</i>

<i>And Juliet is in
the middle of it all.</i>

<i>Alone, confused, and afraid.</i>

So, benvolio and mercutio,
they're Romeo's friends.

And they get into it with
tybalt, who is Juliet's cousin.

He's one badass dude.

<i>Our version of the story opens</i>

<i>on a big rumble
between the families.</i>

Everyone's fighting like it's a
Saturday night in the flats.

<i>And these fights are sick.</i>

<i>During one of the fights,
Romeo ends up getting killed</i>

<i>by Juliet's
badass cousin, tybalt.</i>

<i>Eventually,
Romeo gets run out of town</i>

<i>and that makes
things much worse.</i>

<i>But during our
opening fight, this cop,</i>

better known as
the prince of verona,

shows up and
breaks up the fight.

<i>He tells them that
the next guy to start a fight</i>

<i>is gonna be punished
with death.</i>

<i>So, they all scatter.</i>

But let's get back to the
capulets and the montagues.

<i>Juliet's parents are
talking to this guy, Paris.</i>

<i>He's one of their own,</i>

<i>but he's just a rich guy
that's got his eye on Juliet.</i>

<i>And right then and there,</i>

<i>they tell her that she has to marry
the guy, without even asking.</i>

<i>So, they send out
invites for a party</i>

<i>to get the two
of them together,</i>

<i>and it's capulets only.</i>

<i>And my man, Romeo, shows up,
steals the invite,</i>

<i>and has the bright idea
of crashing the party.</i>

<i>That's where he meets Juliet.</i>

<i>And it's love at first sight.</i>

And that, folks,
is just the beginning.

Yeah!

Yes.

<i>L like it.</i>

Bye, melea.
Bye.

Great stuff today.
Yeah, you, too.

Thank you. Thank you.

All right, see you soon.
Bye, see you soon.

Bye, girl.
Bye.

See you later.
Bye.

Melea?

Just wanted to tell you I'm proud of you.
You're doing a great job.

Thank you, Mr. Diego.
You're welcome.

And I think you can
call me Eduardo now.

Especially since you're in charge.

Thanks.

But I just can't shake the feeling
that I'm missing something.

The piece needs more.

Edge.
Yes.

A lot of shows have
more than one choreographer.

You need someone with a fresh set of eyes.
A different flair.

Someone with a raw passion. You
find them, and this show will sing.

Thank you.

Yes, you said it.

Really?
Yeah.

I've been spending time there.

I just think you could find something
better to do with your time.

Ishani, you keep telling me I could
do so much to help the flats,

and now that I'm doing it,
you're still not happy.

How is helping that
American chick helping us?

Whoa!
Forget I'm American, too?

Not like her.

Look, melea's got
a lot of kids dancing for her.

Kids who would usually
be out on the streets

getting into trouble
like your...

I'm... yo, I'm... I'm sorry.

Yeah, you should be.

Rented out a private...

Probably, yes.

Great, right on cue.

Sniffing around
for taj, I guess.

No, I was actually
coming to see you.

Girl, you need to stay out of
my face before I hurt you.

Nadinei meme.

Hey, you made it.

Yeah, I came
to talk to lshani.

Oh. The kind of talk
where I need

to take off my
shoes and earrings?

Wasn't planning on it.
That's on lshani.

You need to leave before
you both get a beatdown.

Okay, girl.

You're not the only one
with friends around here.

Okay, you guys, it's
not going down like that.

Mm.

You need to accept the fact
that I'm not scared of you.

You should be.

Whatever.

Look, I need you
to work on my show.

What?

No, thanks.

Why not?

Do you have
something better to do?

I know your type,
and you're not gonna play me.

You put on a show,
and when it's over,

you take off back to America,
and we're still here.

Nothing changes. No jobs, no
money, no hope, nowhere to go.

Kids getting killed
over a goddamn necklace.

So, what would you suggest?
What would work for you?

What would make you happy?

I don't know.

Maybe a rec center,
or a dance hall.

Some place a kid could go and
do something besides drugs.

Then let's do it.

And there's that
"save the world" shit.

I'm serious.
Let's make a difference.

You don't have to stop
at one night, one show.

I want to help.

Are you in?

There's love in the house!
Yeah, baby!

Hey, heads up, everybody.

This is our new
co-choreographer, lshani mfeke.

She will also be dancing
the role of tybalt,

so if you think
she ain't man enough,

I'd watch my back
if I were you.

Well, melea.
You sure this is a good idea?

No,but l haven't been sure of
anything since I started this.

Okay.

But I'm watching you.

Okay, guys, let's set it off.

And make sure to
hit this hard, okay?

All right, get low.

And five, six, seven, eight.

And one, and two, and three, and
four, and five, six, seven, eight.

And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, and eight.

All right, hit it from the top.
All right.

See, now, that's old school.

Think you have something better?
If they can bring it.

Well, that's what you're here for.
Go out there and show 'em.

No problem.

Follow my lead.

Five, six, seven, eight.

Damn.

She's good.
Hmm.

I'm not gonna tell
her that, though.

It's okay. She already knows.

And five, six, seven, eight.

What's up?
Hi, how are you?

Good.

I see you guys
are hard at it.

It's going well.

You have something
for me?

Not yet, but I listened
to your boyfriend's track,

and I'm gonna
lace it with lyrics.

Might want to tell him to add a
horn, just to kick it up a bit.

I will. Thank you.

Your girl over there is amazing.
Yeah, I know.

She's not my girl.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Hmm.

Hmm?

What was that?

Whoa!

Hey, meme?

What?

Come here. We got a problem.

What's up?

Tickets aren't selling
as fast as we had hoped.

At this rate,
we won't have a full house.

That's not an option.
We have to sell out.

We have to make enough
to pay rent on the rec center.

Melea, this is my mama
and my sister, Kiara.

Pleased to meet you,
Mrs. mfeke. Kiara.

They're both seamstresses,

so mama was thinking
they could help out

with the costumes
we still need.

That would be great.

Let me show you
what I borrowed

from the college's
wardrobe department.

Um...

I truly appreciate you giving
'shani this opportunity.

She's been needing
something like this.

They both have.

I couldn't do it without her,
believe me. Thank you.

I think Juliet's family
should wear red.

Sounds great.

Everyone take five.

Melea, can I talk to you?
What's up?

<i>You know the whole Romeo
and Juliet theme? Hmm.</i>

It's all about the dumb stuff
people pull, beginning to end.

Yeah, but in this scene,
these guys are family.

So, they don't act dumb?

You ever been to a party
and someone wasn't acting out?

Not lately, no.
Exactly.

Even the ladies should be
trying to one-up each other.

Like when we first met.

So, what you're saying is...

Get over here.
Let's show 'em how it's done.

Okay.

Zam, give us something
we can work with.

What you want?

Quit playing around.

Come on, let's bring it.
You ready?

Whoo!

Yes!

That's what I'm talkin' about.

You pushed Juliet, and she pushed back.
L love that

okay. That was hot.

You're okay by me.

Man,
you girls are soft.

You love it.

And five, six, seven, eight.

Cue Romeo.

Really get into it.

Feel it.

Dajon, are you all right?
Mm-mm.

It was an accident.

I'm sorry, man.
It's okay.

Don't... it's okay.

Just need...
Oh, no!

No, it's not okay.

We have to get
you to a hospital.

I'll take him.
My car's out front.

Eduardo, how is he?

It's fractured.

You're definitely
gonna need another Romeo.

I need you.

Whoo!

Yeah.
Yeah.

That was good,
but that song gotta go.

What are you talking about?
I thought it was perfect.

Really? Do you think
that's the best he can do?

Let me guess. You got
something better in mind?

As a matter of fact,
i do, man.

Yeah.

Play it, zam.

Whoo!

Whoo!

Now, that's something new I've
been working on for you, melea.

Because I think
you can do better.

Are you kidding me?

You know,
I'm gettin' really sick

of you running your
mouth all the time.

Shut up, man.
What?

Stop it!

No,no,no.
Stay out of this, lshani.

It's between me and him.

What, I'm stupid?

I'm not.
You're fighting over melea.

What?

We're fighting over the music.

Music? I'm fighting
over my girlfriend.

What... what? No...
Then stop it.

This is insane. Come on, taj is
just trying to help, you guys.

Melea, don't be stupid.

You said it yourself.
He can have any girl he wants.

And he wants you.

Hey, lshani.

Ishani, wait.

Hey, where are you going?

Anywhere.

Away from here, away from him.

Ishani, look at me.
I'm not into taj.

I'm in love with Erik. Besides,
i wouldn't do that to you.

I know how much you like him.

Do you?

Look, I'm not
playing this game with you.

We both know you want taj. You're
always throwing yourself at him.

I'm not gonna be a deooy so you
oan cheat on your boyfriend.

What?

What are you talking about?
Are you crazy?

Yeah. Yeah, I'm crazy.

Crazy for letting
my guard down

with a girl who's used to
getting whatever she wants.

Crazy to get involved
with you, this show.

Good luck with your
fantasy world, melea.

I'm going back
to the real one.

Hey.

Look, I just want to
let you know that I'm done.

I'm done with us,
I'm done with the show.

If I'm not gonna be
your Romeo in real life,

why am I gonna be
him in your musical?

L just need a break,
all right?

I'm gonna focus on myself.
That's what I'm gonna do.

Erik...
No. Bye, melea.

Meme.

Hey.

Hey, girl.

So sorry about all this.

But I think it's a sign.

Erik said he's out.
Tickets are just not moving.

Mm-mm.

Can't make this happen
out of thin air.

So, I think we need to regroup and try
and make this work at another time.

Okay, baby girl?

Wait, Erik didn't bail
on you as well, did he?

Look, I don't want to talk about it.
I'm cool.

Hit me later?

Get in.

I'm not
going anywhere with you.

Girl, I said get in.

What is your problem?

I don't have a problem.

You're the one hung up on a girl
who doesn't care about you.

Strutting around here like a fool,
and she ain't even into you.

You're right. She's not.

I guess being rich and famous
doesn't work on everybody, huh?

Apparently not.

Let me ask you somethin'.

Why'd you get so mad?

Because I'm your friend, and i
was just looking out for you.

Is that all?

Yeah.

Damn, that's too bad,
because, um, you're right.

Lam crazy about this girl and she
acts like I don't even exist.

That's too bad. Maybe you
should give up on her.

I don't think I can do that.

Not when I'm
this close to her.

What?

Ishani, I'm hung up on
somebody, but it's not melea.

It's you.

Taj, don't play with me.
I'm not.

Why do you think I come back
here every chance I get?

Ishani, I come to see you.

I don't believe you.
You've never said anything.

Because I didn't want
to ruin our friendship.

And then, your brother...

Hey, lshani, look at me.

I'm tired of waiting
and playing games.

I bought a house
to impress you.

I got involved
with the community.

Now, I'm just
gonna flat-out say it.

Ishanllloveâ€œ.

Me, too.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Hey, Erik.

We need to talk.

<i>This is zubair khumalo,</i>

<i>and we are live from goodhope
fm studios in cape town.</i>

We got taj in the studio,

and taj has got a brand-new
album coming out this year,

and he's got something
very interesting as well.

Tell us
about it, dawg.

Yeah, man. A hip-hop
performance

<i>of Romeo and Juliet.</i>

Lshani, where have you been?

<i>Shut up.
Put on the radio. 94.0.</i>

What?

Just do it. 94.0.

<i>That is radical, man.</i>

<i>So, musically, what?</i>

<i>All right, are you merging
the two worlds together</i>

<i>like a yin and a Yang?</i>

Yeah, yeah, yeah,

but I can't take
all of the credit.

<i>This is a passion project of melea Martin.
A'ight?</i>

And I got my man here with me,
Erik wildwood,

and we did a collabo' together
to make it super-dope.

Yo, tell 'em, e.

I want everyone to know
that I put my heart and soul

<i>into this music, because melea
is the love of my life.</i>

On, my god.

And also that i
will be dancing

the part of Romeo
to her Juliet

at the big show
at the bijou theater.

Love of my life.

Guys, that's amazing, man.

Can we drop this beat?
Can we, like, hear it guys?

<i>Taj". Yo,
ready when you are, man.</i>

All right, here it is.

A song by taj,
produced by Erik wildwood.

It's the opening scene

<i>in melea Martin's
hip-hop r and j.</i>

<i>Boo-yam!</i>

Uncle Simon,
what are you doing?

It's for my niece's show, man.
With the youngster, taj.

Oh, taj!

Come on, mama. Let's see those moves.

You guys are so whack.

Whoo!

You said they were only
using it for rehearsals.

But there's no rule against the
theater operating, Ms. Lee.

Don't believe me?
Check the contract.

Lam this close
to killing this deal.

If you want
this thing to work,

you had better
start playing ball.

If you want
this thing to work,

best you start considering the
community and what they want.

They don't want you,
or your theater.

They've proved that.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

We'll see.

So, I'm the love
of your life, huh?

Yeah,
i know, it's pretty corny.

No, actually,
it's pretty awesome.

Huh?

Yeah, yeah, that's it.
Thatone.

Now, now, move it a bit to the left.
Yeah. Little more.

Little... that's it. Good.

That's perfect.
Now, this one.

Hey- hey-

I can't believe it.
Neither can l.

Shoot, I can.

Thank you, guys,
for not giving up on me.

Looks like we're gonna need
to add another performance.

So, you get to change
the world after all.

The world? I'll
settle for that dance space.

Me, too.

But we still need
to find a new place.

Wow.

You really know how to suck
the life out of everything.

Right?

I don't know how you've
been her friend for so long.

Yeah, neither do I.

Phew.

Stop, stop, stop.
Why?

He's great. It's the ending.
I don't like it.

Melea...

No, seriously. I mean, we all
end up dead, and that's it?

Hey, you're preaching
to the choir.

You killed me off
in act 3, remember?

I still don't like it.

So,changeil

I can't.
Why not?

Prokofiev wanted to
change the ending, too,

but his investors
wouldn't let him.

So, you're saying
just change the story?

Why not?

You already changed the dance.

Yeah, melea. Haven't we all had
enough tragedy in our lives?

Let's take back control.

Yeah.

You're right.
Yeah.

Okay, everybody.
It's gonna be a long night.

Careful with that, man.

'Shani, come on!
We gotta go!

Yeah, coming!

Wish me luck.

Thank you.
Thank you.

And this must...
This little one. Okay?

Phew.

Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

Right. You do this
all the time, bro.

I feel like I'm gonna
have a heart attack.

Then before you die,
you should know something.

What?

You hit like a girl.

Thanks.

Better?
Better, yes. Thanks.

All right.
Gotta get to my seat.

All right. Enjoy.

Phew.

Then it's like...
Okay, round...

So, you ready to get serious?

Yeah!

Ow!

Thank you, mama.

Yes, thank you,
Mrs. mfeke, so much.

So, any last words
for the troops?

Let's do this.

Ladies and
gentlemen, please take your seats,

turn off your cell phones,
and enjoy the show.

Sit down.

For never was a story
of more woe than this,

of Juliet and her Romeo.

Two young people from
different sides of the track,

two lovers star-crossed.

Now, Romeo, being a montague,
and Juliet, being a capulet,

meant that their love
could never be accurate.

Their families
were sworn enemies,

so them being in love
would just add to it.

The ongoing fights about
who's wrong and right,

but after all these years, still,
two wrongs don't make a right.

Sharing a love strong
enough to die and kill for,

the kind of love that everyone
should try and live for.

So, please, if you will,
open eyes, all attend,

the show must begin, but
I'll be back before it ends.

They gettin' into it already.

Whoa!

Ooh!

Whoo!

Go, Juliet! Mm!

Whoo!

That's what we came to see!

Oh!

Yeah, all right!
Whoo!

Ooh!

It's just a dance, baby.

No, mama. It's so much more.

Guys, can you believe this?

Ifsinsane.

Ishani, you okay, baby?

You want me to get some
revenge on Romeo over there?

Nah, it's cool.

Hey, you okay?

What's wrong? Nothing at all.
I'm fine.

Guess I just can't believe that
this is all finally happening.

I wish my mom
could've seen it.

Um, you lovebirds need to save
all of this for the stage.

The intermission is over.

Okay, people!

It's time to rock.

Yes!

Let's go!

These violent delights
have violent ends,

drawing swords,
spilling blood.

Vicious brawls over grudges.

Vengeance and
rage lead to death,

leaving no room
for discussions.

Banished for his actions,
Romeo has got to leave.

Will they ever be together? We'll
just have to wait and see.

Whoo!

They want her
to marry that guy.

It's not good.

Did she really kill herself?

Nah, she's just faking.

But then she can't be...
Come on, show respect.

Okay.

Whoo!

Things have come full circle
in the state of despair.

Juliet holds the solution in
her hand and just stares.

Slowly dancing
with the potion,

yeah, she's going
through the motions.

A selfless sacrifice, hoping
the gates of love will open.

Ready to die for her love,
ready to rise up above.

Putting an end to all the pain is
all she's hoping that it does.

So, will Romeo oome save his
only love before her time's out?

Will true love prevail?

The time has come
for us to find out.

Whoo-hoo!

Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

You know, when nureyev danced this,
they clapped for 40 minutes.

Ls that right? Mm-hmm.

I don't even know what to say.

Say you did it.
We all did it.

Well, I imagine you
won't have much trouble

selling tickets
from here on out.

I hope not, but we
still don't have a space.

Actually, I don't think
that will be a problem.

How would you like to establish
a permanent dance center,

here at the bijou?

You're serious?

The community
needs this place.

That's great, but what
made you change your mind?

Consider it
a charitable gesture.

Yeah. Her company wants
to have the appearance

of being good people.

Well, whatever the reason,
thank you.

Meleai uh...

Except I'd like to ask
for a favor, please.

Which is?

I'd like to name it after my
mother and 'shani's brother.

All right, yeah.

Done.
Thank you.

You're welcome.

Yeah!

Are you okay?

Thank you.

Melea! 'Shani! Melea! 'Shani!
