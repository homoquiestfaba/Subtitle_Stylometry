It was a storm of judgement.

Foryears we had been hiding
from repression.

Hiding from Napolean's spies.

But now, nature

was washing away the disease.

I always knew, as with

all things built
on the wrong foundations,

the farmwould one day crumble.

At last the wait was over.

The poisonous cement
which held Napolean's

evil dream together
was beingwashed away.

I could taste it in the water.

I was old.

I was almost blind.

But I could still remember.

It startedwith the day
the Pilkingtons returned Mollie.

Old Major, the prize boar,

had had a dream and the other pigs
had called ameeting in the barn.

Now boys. Not too much.
Hush up, woman.

They shouldn't do that.
They're having fun, now hush up.

Yes, we're only playing, Ma.

And one day, the pigs might come
and playwith you.

There you go again,
talking rubbish.

They're only dumb animals, God.

Boxer! Boxer!
Keep straight!

Look where you're going, Boxer!

Keep aline, keep aline.

Fool of ahorse going

the wrongway.

Boxer! Boxer!

What the?

Whoa, Mollie, whoa there.
Whoa...

Whoa, whoa.

Jones, you old drunkard.

Mr. Pilkington.
Mrs... Nice hat.

We've brought your horse back.

Thanks.

All right, was she?
Mollie...

Yes, she did the job.
Where do you want her?

There's ameeting tonight
in the barn.

Okay, Jessie.
I'll be there.

Is kind ofyou to invite us.
Is nothing special.

Just a few neighbors over
for a drink.

Well, we wouldn't want to miss out
on this generosity,

wouldwe?

Look, Mr. P, about your money...
My dear boy.

We'll speak tonight.
Hey, walk on.

Bye bye, Jessie.

I hate him. He smells.
Oh, do be quiet.

Come on, Mollie. Come on!

That man has loserwritten
all over his face.

I don't think
he can take much more.

I thought he was your friend.
My friend?

How verylittle you know
of the world.

Come on, Boxer.
Walk on and keep aline.

Keep aline, damn you.

Go on, step in, Boxer.

Boxer!

Boxer, look what
you've done to me field.

You stupid lump of dog flesh.
You're dog meat.

You're a dead horse, Boxer.

You're for the glue factory.

I'll strangle you
with my own hands.

Whas going on?

Leave him be.

Leave him be.

Thou shalt not kill.

He was hurting Boxer.

No animal can ever
attack ahuman.

No human should ever
hurt an animal.

Jones!

Where are you?

Jessie, Jessie!

Go, quick.

I've got a train to catch.

Quick, she's coming, quick.

Wake up, you drunken pig.

We're now late and the car
probablywon't start anyway.

You saidyou'd get it fixed.
Now please don't get drunk.

There's a clean tablecloth
in the cupboard.

Don't wear those boots. Don't call
me at my sisters, she hates you.

Hey, come on girls.

You're supposed to be
at the meeting.

Come on.

Follow me.

And the sink is blocked

and the butchery's full of flies.

Make sure you get Pilkington
to lendyou more money.

Animals...

The wisest ofus all has words
which must now be spoken.

These words came to Old Major
in a dream

and must now be heard.

My friends...

I do not think I will be with you

for many days more.

I have had along life.

And now it is my duty
to pass on to you

such as I understand

of the nature of our lives.

Animalkind is born to amiserable,

laborious, and short existence.

We are given

only just enough food as will
sustain the breath in our bodies

for the work we do,

andwhen our usefulness
has come to an end,

we are slaughtered

with hideous cruelty.

No!
No!

Yes.

Andwho prayis responsible
for our suffering?

Man!

Man is our enemy.

Mr. P?

Oh, not too much now.

Must be trying
to sweeten me up, eh?

Mr. P, about the moneyl owe you...

My dear boy, we're just having
a friendly drink.

Don't want to spoil the occasion,
do we?

The bank is on me, Mr. P. I don't
know what to do. I'm desperate.

Well...

You can always just sign the farm
over to me and have done with it.

Mr. Frederick.

I'm sure Mr. Pwillwork
something out foryou.

Mrs. Jones not about this evening?

No, she's gone to her sister's
on the train.

Remove man,

and the root cause
ofhunger and overwork

is abolished forever.

Remove man,

and the produce of our labor

will be our own.

Remove man, and overnight

we will become

free and equal.

Free and equal.

Free and equal.

Free and equal.
I thought I was free.

Will it mean no harnesses?
You believe that,

you'll believe anything.

We must never come to resemble man
in anyway.

If there are no humans,
who will brush mymane?

Oh, no.

Andwho will braid it
with ribbons?

Did I hear someone sayribbons?

I can get ribbons,
I can get anything.

What you got to trade?

You shouldn't care about

looking pretty for humans.

But I like looking pretty
for humans.

...or engage in trade!

What? No trade?

Amongst us animals there must be

unity and comradeship.

All animals are friends.

All humans are enemies.

We'll have to

stay over, Mr.J.

Help me up, then.

Oh, beg your pardon.

Second door on the left.

Pilkington, we've got to talk now.

Wake up.

I can't pay you.
You've got to give me more time.

In fact, ifyou could see yourway
to lending me another hundred or so,

just for amonth.
Pilkington.

I needyou help.

Wake up,

you fat money-grabbing pig.

Oh, no.

Mrs. P, you've got the wrong room.

No I haven't, my dear.

Don't worry.

He'll be out for the night.

Now, my friends,

I will tellyou about
the end ofmy dream

and the song that came to me.

Is a song you must learn.

Is a song ofjustice and freedom.

Beasts of the world,
we shall unite.

Rise up and ready for the fight.

Soon or late that daywill be,

when man's defeated
andwe are free.

Soon or late that daywill be,

when man's defeated
andwe are free.

Mr. J...

Our limbs be tired andworn,

our dreams will not be broken.

Our hearts will not be torn,

our dreams will not be broken.

Our hearts will not be torn...

Whas going on now?

Blasted coat.

Getting aman out ofhis sleep.

Damn foxes.

Old Major

had been hit.

Was our revolution over
before it had begun?

No!

No, Major. No.

There are no rewards after death.

There is only the here and now.

We must work to make
this life better.

Friends, we must always remember

that Old Major died
for every one ofus.

And now we each have a duty to him.

Revolution!

Must need feeding again.

Jessie!
Jessie, come on girl!

Come on, girl.
Here.

Take it. Here.

Come on.

Hello?

Whas the matter, girl?

You don't like it?

Lfyou paid attention to the farm,
we wouldn't have money troubles.

Where you going?

The animals need feeding.

Dennis...

Eric... drink?
Yeah, come on.

We haven't fed or milked
them yet, Mr. Jones.

We'll do it later.
I need apint.

We need milking.

Stupid dogwants apint, too.

Well, if she's got anymoney,

she can have one.

I'm veryhungry.

You'lljust have to wait.

At last.

Will he feed us now?

Mr. Jones...
What about the animals?

Ah, let them rot.
Come on, lads. Les get

another drink.

I need food.

Les go.
Is in the food store.

Quiet.
Boxer...

We can help ourselves.

Come on.

Come on, follow me.

Wait.

Do you mind?
I'm trying to have my dinner.

Thas mine.

I was saving that.

Leave now.

Boxer.

Boxer, Boxer.

The humans are coming.

Whas going on in there?

Come on, les get them.

Don't give them time to regroup.

Seize the day.

Get in the car!

Wait for me.

Quick, come on. Get inside.

Move it, come on.

Victoryis ours.

What do we do now?
Wait and see.

This is an outrage.

On my farm,

the animals know their place.

Know their place?
Of course theyknow their place.

They're animals.
What am I going to do?

My dear boy, you're homeless.

You've got no money.
The treatment ofyour animals

has led them to seizing power,

an uprisingwhich could easily
spread to all our farms.

You've done enough.

Shut up!

I'm thinking.

Oh, no.
They've come to kill us.

Do something, Mr. P.

Shoo.

And so at last
the farm belonged to us,

andwe were free.

We now knew we could live
without fear.

And Snowballwould show us the way.

Can you read?

Not yet, but I will learn.

Thas good.

Snowball,
the cows are in great pain.

Theyneed milking.

Well, I could try.

All right now, just hold still.

Oh, Lord. Oh, right.
I just need practice.

Can you see anything?

Of course I can't see.
I don't have the eyesight, do I?

Well, can you smell anything?

What? Other than you?

Hey, get off!

There's Snowball andJessie.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Hello, Jessie.

Whas he doing up there?

Come here, come and look.
See, I have aglorious surprise.

What are you doing?

Well, what does it say?

Thas the farm's name.

And as the farm now belongs to us,

what words have I painted?

Us farm?
Animal Farm.

Animal Farm.

Well...

lfyou can write,
you must be able to read.

Yes, we pigs have taught ourselves
to read andwrite.

What is it?

I think is my time.

You're dying?

No. Puppies.

Puppies...

Puppies. Quick, what do we do?
Steadynow, Boxer.

Les getJessie back to the barn.

Boxer!

Boxer, where are you?
Come on, we're waiting.

Are you sure you're okay?

Boxer, go with the others.
I'll be fine.

Lfyou're sure...

I'm sure.

Here by the house.

Whas that?

Is abox where
humans watch humans.

Keeps them quiet.

Could be useful.

Animals,

I propose that the farmhouse
never be used,

but preserved as amuzeum.

All those in favor?

Carried.

Les see how the humans lived.

They steeped themselves in luxury
while we lived in

squalor.

A horsehair chair.

Animals have to die
for humans to sit in comfort.

And this bed, filledwith
feathers plucked from animals.

Oh, heaven's sake.

We must bury them all.

Compatriots.

Over here.

We must work quickly.

Tell Pincher to meet me
in the harness room.

This might be aproblem.

These...

are Old Major's thoughts,
the principals

of Animalism. We must

always remember
what he taught us.

What is important...

is that we must never

come to resemble man in anyway.

One: Whatever goes upon two legs
is an enemy.

Two:

Whatever goes upon four legs
or has wings

is a friend.

After all, we are animals.

Three:
No animals shallwear clothes.

Four: No animals
shall sleep in abed.

We can no longer stoop
to his level.

Five: No animal

shall drink alcohol.

Or engage in trade.
Six:

No animal shall kill
any other animal.

Fighting each other
is the nature ofman.

Ah, Pincher. Sit down.
And most importantly...

Seven:

Amongst us animals,
there must be unity

and comradeship.

All animals

are equal.

Hurrah!

I swear on the sacred memory
of Old Major

to serve Napolean
before all others.

To serve Napolean
before all others.

Rise up, Pincher,

and take your position as leader
of the Animal Guard.

Bring in the other dogs.

This is the doctrine
of Old Major.

And it is our duty to follow
each and every commandment.

Animals, animals.

We have work to do.

There's been enough discussion.

We have aharvest to bring in.

And let us make it apoint ofhonor
to do it quicker than humankind.

Now, line up to receive
your instructions.

Left abit. Straight

ahead now.
Right abit.

This is harder than it looks.

I must use all my strength.

We allworked together
in the fields andwe were happy.

The pigs stayed inside the barn
and counted the hay.

Only25bales

ofhay today.

We need more effort.

I... I can...

work harder.

While Snowballworked towards
Old Major's ideals,

Napolean made different plans.

Are the puppies weanedyet?

Nearly.
Well, we have milk to feed them.

Take them away.
Give her some explanation.

Animals!

We are now ready to raise
our flag of freedom.

Well done, Boxer.

I give you...

the hoof and horn.

There now.

I toldyou we'd find him
with his neck in abottle.

"All over in 2 weeks"
I think you said two months ago.

This is what happens when aweak
man is allowed to run a farm.

On my farm, there are no weak men.

Obviously the animals are
managing better than we expected.

We'll have to do something.
I'll do something.

I'll ring his drunken throat.

We need information
on whas going on.

Why don't you send a spy?

How can we send...

No.

But we could listen in.

Now, don't make anynoise.

Come on...

So from the beginning?

A...

G, B, C...
No, no, no.

We'll leave that for now and go
back to our discussion on animalism.

I first started to suspect
that allwas not right

when my puppies were

taken.

Do you understand
four legs good two legs bad?

Yes!
Thas animalism.

Napolean,
I want to see my puppies.

No, Jessie.
You can't see your puppies.

But they're mybabies.
Lfyou were thinking

clearly then you would be pleased
at the special

education that
we're going to give them.

You surely don't want
to disadvantage your own puppies,

do you?

No.
Good.

No, I don't.
Well offyou go then.

They still need their mother.

Her sadness will spread
to the other animals.

Not ifwe distract them.
Yeah.

Education is knowledge.

And knowledge is power.

Well, the knowledge I'd like is...

Who keeps stealing
the milk and apples?

Thas what I call knowledge.

Share and share alike,
isn't that animalism.

Well, where's our share?
Animals, please.

Who has the milk and apples?

Who has the milk and apples?

Who has the milk and apples?

Who has the milk and apples?

Who has the milk and apples?
We pigs have them.

We'll let them calm down.

Then Squealer can explain.

Thank you.

Back in the farm yard,
is lunchtime for the chickens.

Chickens are also one of
Goïs wonders on the farm.

This mother hen is showing her
chicks how to look for grain.

God has given them a sharp

bill so theywill have
no trouble

picking up the bits of food.

All of the farm animals
need lots ofwater.

Well, of course we do.

Animals.

Napolean has arranged for this

television to be here for
your enjoyment and relaxation.

This, my friends,
is animalism in practice.

But it is also animalism
for us pigs

to have the milk and apples.

That doesn't sound fair to me.

I love milk and apples.
We all do.

Mindyou Napolean's always right.

I'll talk toJessie.
She'll explain.

...feed the brain,
and ifyour brains are not fed,

then Jones would come back.

Do any ofyou want
to seeJones back?

No, no!

Good.

Then for all our sakes,

we will continue to drink
the milk and eat the apples.

Yey!

You see no grease,

you smell no grease...

You feel no grease with Joy.

Theywon't let me see my puppies.

Where are they?

I don't know.

Boxer, the pigs

always tell us what to do...

what to think.

We must have leaders.

But what if they're wrong?

Napolean's neverwrong.

Dear Boxer...

He totallybelieved in Napolean.

He just wanted to do right.

Whas this rubbish?
Is not rubbish.

I've heard my animals
sound like that.

There's apattern to it.
Like, like they're singing.

Listen!
Yes.

I've heard that sound.

Is a signal. A code.

Is something,
and is spreading.

Four legs good, two legs bad.

We invade.

This is anightmare.

It will onlybe amatter of time
before the humans invade.

You think so?
Yes.

What willwe do?
Defend ourselves, of course.

This is my plan.

Is as I thought. They're
approaching from the top field.

Send the signal.

What if they change directions?

Then we'll make another plan.

Are all the animals in place?

They're in place.

This isn't going to work.
Flying partyhas taken off.

Jessie's marshalling the sheep.

Good.

Give me that!

Les go!

As long as we stay up here,

we're safe.
Let Snowball lead the charge.

Get them!

What was that?

Charge!

Shoot now! Shoot!

Les get out ofhere!
Come on!

Les get out ofhere!
Come on!

Move!

Let me through. Let me through.
Victory.

Glorious victoryis ours!

Well.

We can't beat them.
We might have

to join them.

Is he breathing?

I've killed him.

This is war. The only good human
is a dead one.

I've no wish to take life,
not even human life.

No, he's all right.

He's moving.

Animals...

You were so brave today.

Yes, he was the bravest ofus all.

He's an animal hero first class.
No.

There was no one braver
than Snowball.

Snowball. Snowball.

Snowball. Snowball.

My friends...

We are all heroes.

Andwe will celebrate
this decisive day every

Octoberwith amarch past
our glorious flag

and the firing

of this gun.

Our farm is now truly

Animal Farm.

Napolean, Napolean, Napolean.

Napolean, Napolean, Napolean.

Snowball

continued to try
to improve our lives.

And soon came up with
anew scheme.

We were called to ameeting.

My friends,

surely you can see Snowball's idea
for awindmill is awaste oflabor.

Yeah.
Is not awaste.

Once built,
it will ease our labors.

Yeah.

Our efforts must be directed
at feeding ourselves,

arming ourselves, barricading our
borders and defending animalism.

Yeah.
No, no, no.

For animalism to prosper

we must convert all the animals
on all the farms.

We must send our pigeons out to
spread the message ofrevolution.

Yeah.

We willvote on it.

Yeah.

All those in favor of Napolean.

Yeah.

And all those in favor
of Snowball.

Yeah.

Animals,

think of the benefits
of awindmill.

Yes, it will be
hardwork to build.

But once is built it could
save us so much labor

that we mayhave to work
only three days aweek.

Now, all those in favor.

Yeah.

You pig.

Snowball...

Puppies?

Puppies, leave him,
is Snowball.

Leave him! Puppies!

My puppies had become
Napolean's servants.

Snowballwas banished
and Napolean took control.

Thas Old Major's place.
Friends.

Whas he doing up there?

Snowball is a traitor
and a criminal.

But he was abrave fighter.

Braveryis not enough.
Loyaltyis more important.

You see how clever Napolean
has been, my friends.

Of course, he's not against
the windmill.

In fact, it was his own idea.

He opposed it to flush out
Snowball for the traitor he is.

Tactics, friends.

There will be no more meetings.
No more endless debates.

From now on,

a special committee ofpigs will
decide on all aspects of the farm.

No!

Thas enough.

Now,

I will tellyou of our plan
for the windmill.

So began our toil.

It was a slow,
laborious process

andwe were watched at all times.

It was Boxer's great strength
that reallymade the difference.

But each and every one ofus
played our part.

And slowly,

very slowly the windmill
began to take shape.

And at night we'd return home

weary

and hungry.

Nothing.

Theymust have found
the microphone. But wait. Listen.

...to build the windmill.

My friends...

They can talk.

Long live Animal Farm.

If they can talk,
they can trade.

You can't trade with animals.

Whynot?
Is immoral.

Is business.

Is my farm.

That farm has been in his family
for generations.

Yes, andwhas he done with it?
Ruined it, thas what.

Congratulations.

You've actuallymanaged to turn
your father's prosperous farm

into a debt-ridden,
crumbling piece ofrubbish.

Very clever.

You can't tlak to me like that.

Yes I can.

I can say something else as well.
You're finished around here.

Both ofyou.
Washed up, dead in the water.

Are these words sinking in?

Yes, I think they are.

Thas strange.
There's someone in the house.

This isn't right.

They're behaving like men.

Puppies, stop that.
I'm your mother. Stop it.

Stop it!
Puppies!

Off to bedwith you.

What are you doing here?

This areais out ofbounds.

Nothing. I was just walking
and the dogs came at me.

Have you seen anything ofinterest
in yourwalk?

Nothing.

Get back to the barn.

Things were changing fast

and at night we heard
strange noises

as Squealer altered
the commandments.

...with sheets.

Avery good day to you, Mister...

Napolean.

Pilkington.
Very pleased to meet you.

Splendid.

Splendid.
We will go into the house.

Absolutely, afteryou, dear boy.

Dear boy? Dear boy?

Wonderful.

A porkerwith a sense ofhumor.

Old Major's words no longer

made any sense.

The pigs were now living
in the house.

Napolean was rarely seen

but a statue had been made
in his honor and placed

near the barn.

Todaymarks the beginning of
anew direction for us.

Animal Farm cannot exist
in isolation.

To improve our quality oflife,

to build the windmill,
to feed ourselves,

we need to trade.

Didn't Old Major say
we must never engage in trade?

Is always the same.

What goes around, comes around.

None of this need concern
any ofyou.

As your leader,

I will shoulder the burden
of trade myself.

The pigs dedicated

to his memory the place
where Old Major had fallen.

Our revolution continues,

and all our actions
will now be looked on

by the founder of our beliefs.
Pincher.

Only criminals

would fear Old Major's presence.

Long live Animal Farm.

Long live Animal Farm.

Well, thas a tidyload ofhay,
Mr. Napolean.

Dear boy.

You know,

this could prove to be
a very profitable arrangement

between ourselves, Mr. N.

You know you can trust me.

I mean, I neverwanted to have
anything to do with that invasion.

That was all Frederick

andJones' idea.
Jones is our enemy.

And I am your friend.

Got abottle ofwhisky foryou.

A token ofmy gratitude.

Just try this.

Dear boy.

Now to business.

There's a shortage of eggs
on the market.

They're fetching
a very good price.

Listen. There's something I have to
tellyou all. Is about the pigs.

They are living in the house.
No.

Yes. And they're sleeping
in the beds.

No.

Now is against the commandment.

No animal shall sleep in abed.

Yes, thas right.
Thas the...

My friends, let me

explain.

As you know, we pigs
are the brains of the farm,

andwe must have a quiet place
to work in

for allyour sakes.

Surely you don't want
your glorious leader

to live in a sty.

Of course not. Andyes,

we do sleep

in beds, andwhynot?

There is no ruling against beds,

apile of straw is abed.

Wouldyou rob us of our sleep

so that we're too tired
to carry out our duties?

But there's the commandment.

What commandment?

There was never
a commandment against

beds, read it.

"No animal

shall sleep in abed
with sheets".

You see? Is a commandment
against sheets.

Andwe certainly don't sleep
in sheets.

Oh, no.

Napolean is always right.

Exactly.

I managed to convince
the animals

to buy those rusty old silos
I couldn't get rid of.

Theyhaven't got a clue
what to do with them.

Not only that,
they've built awindmill.

And I'll end up owning that
as well asJones' farm.

What about the hunger,
Mr. Pilkington?

What hunger?

I've seen some of the animals.
Flesh and bones.

Theylook all right to me.

Yes, but you're not seeing straight
with all that trade you're doing.

My dear boy, if the pigs prefer
to dealwith me, should I refuse?

The animals are starving,
and is not to your credit.

Same again all around.

You're still here then?

Pilkington, I'll show him.

Let him try to get his hands
on this now.

Quick!

Ourwindmillwas ruined.

Our spirits

were at their lowest.

But Napolean

seemed triumphant.

Do you know who is
responsible for this?

Do you know who has stolen the truck
and blown up ourwindmill?

Snowball!

The arch-criminal and traitor

has destroyed ourwork
of the last year.

Animals,

I pronounce the death sentence
on Snowball.

We will teach this traitor

that he cannot undo ourwork
so easily.

The windmillwill be rebuilt.

Everydaywe willwork,
rain or shine,

food or none.

Long live the windmill!

Boxer...

So early?

I must get on.
We've got to rebuild

the windmill.

Decree number six:

Our leader pronounces that
"Beasts of the World"

was the song of the revolution

through which we expressed
our longing for abetter society.

But as that society
is now established,

that song no longer
has anymeaning.

Boxer, come on, please.
You'll hurt yourself.

I have to do this.

We have anew song that
gives voice to our gratitude for

allwe have.

Beloved leader Napolean,

fearless faithful guardian,

proud and strong, protect us from

the wrong. You will defend us
with your lofty trotter...

Pigs, our pigs,
there is no beast

thas braver, theywill not
everwaver, they face the fight

for right, with might...

Glorious great and triumphant,

gallant hero resilient,

proud and strong,

protect us from the wrong,
you will defend us

with your lofty trotter...
Pigs are pigs are pigs.

Where is our food?
I'm sorry, Boxer.

I don't think
we're going to get any.

We must have food.
I'm so hungry.

Make way for our leader.

Our valient leader,

animal hero first class
and animal hero second class

will now speak.

My friends, I have found out

that the arch-criminal Snowball
is stillvisiting the farm.

Is he?

I haven't seen him.

He has even blocked drains.

Snowball's sabotage is the reason
for our shortage of food.

But he must have inside help.

Which ofyou

is in league with him?
I will findyou out.

They guiltywill have
nowhere to hide.

Because of this sabotage

the hens will have to surrender
their eggs for sale in the market.

Thas murder.
You hens should

welcome this sacrifice as your own
special contribution to animalism.

Never. Never.

You dare defy
our glorious leader?

We will smash our eggs
before giving them up.

Yeah, dead right.

All hens are criminals.

No hen will be fed.

Any animal seen giving food
to ahen will be punished

by death.

And so in the middle of the night
the hens sacrificed their eggs.

This is so wrong.

What have we done?

Now what?

Go back to sleep, my friend.

We're just moving some ofJones'

camera equipment.

You'll see the films later.

With efficiency and patriotism
the Animal Guard

roots out enemies of the farm.

Come with me.

There's no hiding place for

Snowball's cohorts.

Don't make anoise.
Les go.

And there's no escape from

justice as they go on trial
for crimes against animalism

in front of our impartial leader.

Our commandments say

no animal shall kill
any other animal.

Guilty!

...without cause.

Without cause? Thas...

We have cause.

Guilty!

Guilty!

Guilty!

And now for other news.

Our leader, the glorious
andvaliant Napolean,

was today awarded highest medal
of animalism,

the Leader's Star, first class.

But before we close
our transmission,

les hear some words ofpersonal
thanks for our glorious leader.

Thanks to our beloved Napolean,

I have laid six eggs in five days.

Thanks to the leadership
of our beloved Napolean,

this grass tastes
better than ever.

And until tomorrow,
is good night from me.

Good night.

I like whisky.

The pigs were behaving
more and more

like farmerJones.

What is it?

Glorious

leader Napolean,

glorious leader,

Napolean...

Shut up.

Squealer,

come quick.
Napolean says he's dying.

So am I.

Napolean didn't die,
and neither

did his taste forwhisky.

Life was bleak.

But nothing prepared us
forwhat happened next.

We were on ourwayhome when
a duck brought us the bad news.

Jessie!

Jessie!

Boxer has fallen by the windmill.
He's on his side.

Boxer?

Go! Go and tell Napolean.
Hurry.

Up there, just on the other side
of that cloud,

lies the kingdom in the sky.

Where no animal ever goes hungry.
Say after me.

"I believe in the

sugarcandy that grows on trees".
Boxer!

"I believe in the everlasting..."
Get off ofhim, you... Boxer!

Boxer.

What happened?

I can't breath verywell.

Hush.

Lie still.
It will be all right.

You'll soon feel better.

You have enough stones here

to finish the windmill.

I think I maynow be
allowed to stop.

Yes, of course, you must stop.

I will enjoymyretirement.

If any animal deserves to rest,
is you, Boxer.

Here, try to drink some water.

Yes, yes, I will.

Anyimprovement?

Our leader is going
to make arrangements

to have his most loyalworker

treated in hospital.

Thank you.

Now back to work.

But I don't think
I should leave him.

Boxer, Boxer.

Is time to go.

I'm veryweak.
Listen, Boxer.

You're going to be fine.

You're going to the hospital
and they'll make you better.

Come on, you must use
allyour strength to get up.

Yes. Is difficult.

I know, my friend.

Please, do it for me.

Do it for all ofus.

Yes, yes. I'll try.

Quick, they're taking Boxer away.
Come and say good bye.

Somehow Boxer managed to summon up
the last ofhis strength

andwe watched
as he entered the van.

Something smelledwrong.

It made us nervous.

Lock it up. Les go.

No!

No!
Whas going on?

The words on the van.

S, E, T...

Horse slaughterer.

They're taking him
to the glue factory.

No, Boxer, get out.

Boxer, come on, help me, Benny!
Boxer!

Boxer!

Boxer, get out quick!
Get out!

Kick yourway out!

They're taking you to your death.
Boxer!

Boxer!

Boxer!

We called out

desperately.

But we heard him
give up the struggle.

Well, Mr. N, thas that.

Avery profitable afternoon.
Your share.

Buywhiskywith it.

Is expensive.

Use all the money.

Certainly, my friend.
I like whisky.

I could have saved him.

Nobody can save any ofus.

I could have.

How?

I found aplace
at the edge of the farm.

A good place to hide.

I should have taken him there.
But I did nothing.

I'll never forgive myself.

Well, you could put
the wrong right.

Yeah, yes, you're right.

Murielwill not last much longer.
And there are others.

Then we must save them.

We must leave this place
with as many animals as we can.

Thas it.

Forward,

forward in the name
of the revolution.

Long live Animal Farm.

Long live

our beloved Napolean.

Napolean is always right.

Those were his

last words.

Rumors.

Some ofyou are saying that
the van that took Boxer away

was from the horse slaughterer.

Surely you know our beloved
leader better than that.

The van was from the hospital

but had previouslybeen
the property of

the slaughterer.

So no more rumors.

Mindyour step.

Thas right.
Come on in now.

Delighted to join you for

aneighborly drink,

aren't we, Mrs. P?

We certainly are.
What are they doing here?

Thas right, my dear.
Come around here.

There. You sit here.

Okay, there we are.

Nice and friendly, eh?

I've heard such alot
about you, Mr. N.

So...

All getting on splendidly.
Mayl?

No, you can't.
Quiet!

You're letting him drink
all ourwhisky.

Lfyou're not quiet, I'll stick you
on top of that flagpole forever.

A toast.

Allow me.

Absolutely, dear boy.

Allow me to congratulate you on

keeping your lower

animals in order.

Thank you.
An example to all

farmers.
I mean, les face it.

No animal suffered from
working alittle harder

or eating alittle less,
did they?

Present company excluded,
of course.

Another toast to Animal Farm.

No, not Animal Farm.

I've decidedwe should revert

to our proper name of Manor Farm.

To Manor Farm then.

And our continued prosperity.

Absolutely, dear boy.

I can't tell the difference
between them.

Read it to me.

"All animals are equal, but

some animals are more equal
than others".

More equal than others.

Come on, we should leave
while we still can.

I'll get the others.

And now we go
to our leader's house

where earlier today a spontaneous
demonstration took place.

A grateful duck has written
anew song

for our beloved leader,

and she's here joined by
chorus of the Animal

Guard.

Praise to him,
the font of all ourwisdom...

Long to live the ruler
of our farm, Napolean...

Mightyleader, mightyleader,
watching over us...

Napolean, mightyleader...

Mightyleaderwatching over us.

Shout, shout, shout out loud,
snout, snout, pink and proud...

Friend on high
you guide us with your smile.

Teach us how to be as kind as you,
Napolean, mightyleader.

Mightyleaderwatching over us.

Napolean, mightyleader...

Mightyleaderwatching over us.

Shout, shout, shout out loud,
snout, snout, pink and proud...

Perfect pig you bless us
with your beauty.

Hallowed hog,
how wondrous is your glow...

Napolean, mightyleader...

Mightyleaderwatching over us.

Napolean, mightyleader...

Mightyleaderwatching over us.

Shout, shout, shout out loud,
snout, snout, pink and proud...

Shout, shout, shout out loud,
snout, snout, pink and proud...

Four legs good,
two legs better.

Four legs good,
two legs better.

Four legs good,
two legs better.

Four legs good,
two legs better.

Four legs good,
two legs better.

Animals! Never again willwe be
threatened by our enemies.

I decree this farmwill now devote
itself to the making ofweapons,

to the building ofwalls,

to the protection of ourselves
and ourway oflife.

The revolution is over.

All animals are now free.

Free?

Life had been far from free
in our hideout.

Seasons came andwent.
Andwe waited.

The years passed.

We grew old. But we stillwaited.
Waited for...

what surelymust pass.

Waited for Napolean's
cruelty and greed

to bleed the farm to death.

And now with the coming
of the storm

came the first signs
that ourwait was over.

It was time for us to return
to that place

that had once been
full of such hope.

I wondered if anything

was still alive.
I knew in my

heart that Napolean had fallen

victim ofhis own madness.

But what of

the others?

After allwe had been through,

I needed to believe
that there was still hope.

Could this be the same place

where Old Major had spoken

ofhis dream?

Where we hadworked so hard
for abetter life?

All that was left was

the memory and the pain of the

poor creatures who had suffered.

Myheart sank.

But there are always survivors.

The walls had now fallen.

The skies have healed.

And life goes on.

Andwhat of the

future?

There are new owners.

We will not allow them
to make the same mistakes.

We will rebuild the farm.

And now at last we shall be free.
