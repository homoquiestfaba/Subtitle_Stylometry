[bells jingling]

[calm music]

of life is not death.

For, there's honor in death.

Tragedy of life is what
we let die inside of us

while we live.

This land has nurtured our
people for generations.

This land is our mother.

It has given us life.

It has taught us to
walk, to grow, to hunt,

to love, to fight,

to live and to die.

And when it was time to
pass from this world,

this land cradled our bones
and absorbed our souls.

So many of our dearly
departed are buried here,

right under our feet.

This was our pact with Mother
Earth,

from one generation to the
next, for years and years,

until until the white man came.

He came to this land,

a land vast enough to
accommodate many.

He came with the promise of
friendship.

He came with the promise of
peace.

With this understanding,

must one still welcomed the
uninvited.

Time has passed and the land has
received

many more of the uninvited.

But what the visitors never
understood

is that the bond between mother
and child is unbreakable,

irrespective of the circumstances
of their separation,

mother and child must be
together.

Time has passed, yeah, but for
my people,

time has also stood still.

Listen closely.

Can you hear it?

The trees.

The trees are calling.

Mother Earth is calling

It's time for her children
to come back home.

[mysterious music]

[woman screaming]

[suspenseful music]

[lever squeaking]

[fire crackling]

[hammer banging]

[door creaking]

Hey, how you feeling today?

Not one of my best days.

These medical bills really got
me worried.

I know.

I'm sorry.

I hate that you worry about
that.

You've done such a great
job taking care of me.

Your parents would be so proud
of you.

That means so much to me,
auntie.

I really wish I got a
chance to get to know them.

Hey, don't you be going and
saying goodbyes now, okay?

Okay.

I promise

I'll get us through this.

Okay?

Okay.

I'll be back tomorrow, Auntie.

Okay.

[upbeat pop music]

[tires screeching]

[party crowd yelling and
chattering]

Hey, has anyone seen Ricky?

Him and Laney went to take a
drive.

They said they'd be right back.

A drive, huh?

I guess that's what they're
calling it

after being apart for months.

My big bro has this Firebird in
park

and I bet all you guys

he's with Laney in the back
seat.

[guy laughing]

Oh my God.

Guess that calls for another
beer.

[upbeat music]

It's supposed to be right
here.

Why is it so important to you?

Goddammit!

I said enough.

You know this thing's
nothing but bad luck.

Not sure why you want it so bad.

Oh, technically it isn't for you
right?

It's for those Indians

at the casino on silver lake.

Those damn Cherokees

can't let sleeping dogs lie.

I say, leave the past in the
past.

What's done is done.

What is it with these Indians

and their Hocus Pocus bullshit?

Am I right?


I don't believe in that shit.

Do you really think
the ring is, is cursed?

Sorry, what's your name again?

That was a hell of a rodeo,
cowboy.

I missed you Laney.

I missed you too.

Best early Christmas present
ever.

You like that?

Just you wait until New Year's
Eve.

Hey, where are you going?

I gotta take a leak.

[mysterious music]

Did I tell ya?

What did I tell ya?

Wait 'til you get a load of
this.

It's a pretty sight.


Wait, that's impossible.

Somebody must've taken it.

Nobody saw me down here.

Nobody knew I was down here.

I don't see it anywhere.

I swear it was in that box.

I'll find it.

I'll find it somehow.

I know it's gonna be here.

I know I fucked up, man, please.

Come on, please.

Gimme a chance, gimme a
chance to find it for you.

No, please...

[man's neck snapping]

[Laney screaming]

Ricky!

Ricky!

Shit.

Shit, Ricky, where the fuck are
you?

Ricky.

[Laney crying]

Goddammit!

Ricky, where the fuck are you?

[Laney screaming]


[Ricky screaming]

[Ricky screaming]

[foot smashing]

[Laney sobbing]

[Ricky coughing]

[Laney screaming sharply]

[sinister music]

[Laney gasping]

Trish, you're counting, honey?

Coming. I'm coming.

late.

She's not coming back.

No.

Good.

Good luck, Trish.

Now you boys behave

and don't do anything I wouldn't
do.

Now, Chase, are you sure
you're going to be okay?

Of course.

Why wouldn't it be okay?

It's a big place, John.

It's a big responsibility.

You guys, I'm gonna be fine.

Just enjoy your weekend, okay?

Yeah. Mr and Mrs.
Larson have a great time

and I'll, I'll keep good...

I'll keep close, close,
close eye on Chase.

Chase, can I speak with
you privately for a minute?

Scram.

Now, listen son.

Yeah, dad?

I have no problem with your
friend here spending the night.

His name is Javon.

Right, Javon.

But just remember you're
the one in charge.

I know.

No funny business.

Make sure you lock up
everything before bed.

And then of course, no parties.

Who would I invite to a party?

Javon's pretty much

my entire social life at the
moment.

No one goes into my private
study.

Relax, I'm not gonna let
him in, it's off limits.

Good.

Yeah, have a good weekend.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Have a great time and Hey Mr.
Larson,

don't worry about a thing.

It is on bro.

Party at Liberty Manor!

Damn.

How have you never invited me
here before?

Oh, we should see if Adrianna
and Kayla

wanna come up here.

Yeah.

So which way is your dad's study
anyway?

Is that where he hides
all the good scotch?

In case you haven't heard his
study is totally off limits.

Why?

it's his little museum to this
place?

Liberty Manor was built on
some old Indian grounds.

So he keeps all the artifacts in
there.


Just remember, it's off
limits.

My dad would ground me for like
a month.

[Javon laughing]

Ground you?

Ground you?

You're in college, homie.

Man up.

All right, so let me get this
straight.

So it's you,

your sister,

your parents

in this big ass house?

Pretty much.

We hire a few people
during the peak season,

but the rest of the time, it's
just us.

Oh, and Mr. Jenkins,
he's our groundskeeper.

Or, was our groundskeeper.

What happened to him?

We had to fire him.

He had a bad case of sticky
fingers.

That sucks.

Yeah, just leaves us
and the Indian ghosts.

What, what, what?

The Indian ghosts.

You know, sometimes
you can hear him crying

out in the woods at night.

I'm just kidding.

Truthfully, it just comes
down to what you believe.

The developers of this estate
even found some remains

of an old burial ground right
over there.

Really?

Yeah.
That's fucking dope.

Not sure exactly what happened.

Over the trees though, am I
right?

Sometimes at night they tell the
story.

Cool, cool man.

Sweet, well, I'll, I'll tell
Eddie

to bring you some peyote

and we'll pay some respects.

Pay respects?

This is our land now.

It's been in my family for
generations.

Oh, well...

Guess you're just gonna
have to smoke to that then.

All right, let's get this
started here.

Yo, this place is dope!

Wow, this place is freaking
huge.

Thank you.

Where's the master?

Oh, that's my parent's room.

So, that one's gonna be off
limits.

Oh geez, don't be such a goody
guide.

Kayla, I'm sure there's
plenty of other rooms.

Lay off.

Fine.

Do you want me to bring
you down the hall, Becky?

Huh?

room?


Yo. how many rooms they got?

I call dibs on this one.


Yo, this one's mine.

[cellphone buzzing]

Yeah?

David, I want an update.

Now, Mr. Jenkins didn't honor
his word.

It's just a setback.

Don't let it ruffle your head
dress.

You better find it.

Don't come back without it.

[knocking on door]

Adrianna.

Hey Chase.

This house is amazing.

Finally, now the party can
start.

Let's go put your stuff
away and pour a drink.

Sounds good to me,

But chase, where's the master?

Oh, it's all the way
down the hall to the left.

I'll take you.

Okay.

right around the corner.

[mysterious music]

Here's the master.

Awesome, this worked
perfect, thanks Chase.

I'll be out in a minute, Chase.

Oh, right, sorry.

[upbeat pop music]

Yo, man, this party's off the
hook, dog.

I dunno, you guys are
getting pretty loud.

Hey boys.

Hey girlfriend.

Hello, Kayla.

Well, hello, Mr. Larson.

You need to loosen up a bit,
man.

I am.

Whatever, dog.

You're as uptight as a
camel's ass in a sand storm.

Wow, Chase, this place is
amazing.

I just love the architecture.

The ceiling is mahogany, right?

I guess so.

Great, what were you saying?

One large pepperoni pizza.

Is that cool with everybody?

Hell yeah.

So what do you want from me?

I want you to have
fun at your own party.

Javon, I don't think that's...

Listen, look man, look, look.

You gotta, you gotta talk
to the people, you know?

Look at that vibe.

Socialize, mingle, you know?

Have you said anything to anyone
today?


That's what I'm saying.

What do you think I should do?

Excuse me, excuse me.

Can I get everybody's attention
please?

Real quick, right up here, yo!

Can I just get a quick round
of applause for my man,

Chase Larson for opening up his
house

and for throwing this little
shindig.

Give it up for him, y'all.

[cheering and applause]

Now, I bet a lot of you didn't
notice,

but my man Chase, he's a mad
Magician.

Yeah, nah, shut up, I got you.

Yeah, his routine is dope.

Yeah, he could do anything.

And I mean anything.

Yo, Magic Man, make
Kayla's bra disappear.

You wish.

All right, all right, settle
down, y'all, settle down.

Now, I'm about to introduce
the magician on a mission.

The one and only, Chase Larson.

Give it up for Chase.

Yo, come on man.

Come on, y'all show him some
love guys.

Show him some love.

Come on man, let's go, dog.

Show the people something, man.

Let's go.

Yeah, show him some love, come
on, y'all.

Cheer him on, yeah!

You got this man, you got this,
dog.

Show me some love.

Good evening, my friends.

I really only have one
question for you tonight.

Do you believe in magic?

[all laughing]

Magic is no laughing matter.

The land you're on right now,

the earth beneath your feet,

the Liberty Manor Estate
resides on hallowed ground.

It belonged to an ancient Indian
tribe

that believed in magic.

They believed in the spirit
gods,

that they used magic to rule
the heavens and the earth.

That magic could turn life into
death

as easily as it could turn day
into night.

Oh, shit.

[group chattering]

The Indians also believed

that every soul is a light

and that light will only
continue to burn

as long as you believed
in the power of magic

for belief in magic is a
belief in the sanctity of life.

But if you don't believe in
magic and you lose faith,

well, it's only a matter
of time before the light

in your soul begins to burn up.

[applause and cheering]

That's my boy, I know him, I
know him.

Get over here, man.

That was as cool as football.


Dude, bro, great job.

Thank you.

Great job.

Now it time to get some pussy.

[Chase laughing]

it.

Man, lights back on please.

was that?

there's something outside.


Did you see that?


like,

this isn't cool anymore
dude, like seriously.




Chase, like that was really
not funny.

Yeah, not cool.

Javon, that wasn't me.

I didn't turn them off.

tripping.

Wow, will you look at this?

What?

Well, according to this map,

not only was the manor
built on Indian property,

but right on top of an
Indian burial ground.

So what?

So what?

You don't find that the least
bit odd?

That out of all the property

that they could have built this
manor on,

they built it smack on top of a
graveyard.

Okay, that's creepy.

That's disrespectful is what
that is.

They did it on purpose.

What?

Why would they do that?

To show the Indians that
they're no longer wanted here.

That they no longer matter.

Damn straight.

Eddie.

What?

It's the truth ain't it?

It's just like football.

You don't wanna just win,
you wanna destroy them.

You wanna embarrass them.

That way they never want a
rematch.

And this is why we broke up.

It's the law of the jungle.

Kill or be killed.

God, you're such an asshole.

What?

Yeah, I wouldn't say
you're like a full on asshole

but you're kind of an asshole.

Yeah, you are, you are.

What'd I do?

I'm not the one who turned the
lights off.

Oh, whoa, yo, check this out.

Hey, Javon.

Yo.

Yo.

Yo, guys, look at this,
this is dope as hell.

Javon, we really
shouldn't be in this room.

Yeah, now I know why.

Yo, guys come in here.

Look at this.

Wow, this room is incredible.

tight.

need to get outta here.

This room is off limits.

Guys, take a look at this
ring.


Such a rich history this culture
has.

Yeah and this is all that's
left of it.

Listen to this.

Apparently that ring belonged
to an Indian princess

named Aiyana.

Who gave it to her?

Well, according to this, a
white man

named Samuel Cook.

He was a union soldier and
he wanted to marry Aiyana.

That's really romantic.

Not everybody thought so.

Her father, Chief Dohate,

he forbade the union
saying that the marriage

would bring great shame to his
people.

anyways?

She did.

And her father Chief Dohate

in return declared war on the
locals.

War on the locals, what
does that really even mean?

Well, he cut off Cook's head

and then he scalped several
other soldiers

and then killed his own
daughter.

Cut off her hand and
claimed the ring as his own.


It doesn't end there either.

A lot more of the tribe
was killed after that

by the white men in retaliation,

they had overwhelming firepower.

What was that?

Did you see that?

Something just moved outside the
window.

Ooh, someones scared.

Relax, Kayla, there's nobody
out there.

Anyway, Chief Dohate was
captured

and brought before a
council of union soldiers.

He was charged with the
incitement

of many people in mass murder.

He was hung right here on this
very site.

With the noose fitted around his
neck,

he muttered some words
in an ancient dialect

that apparently cast an
eternal curse on that ring

and all of those who
inhabit this sacred land.

You don't actually believe

this ring is a curse though, do
you?

Well, he was hung on this very
spot

and according to legend his
ghost

and the ghosts of all the
slaughtered

still haunt these very woods.

It's true.


It's true.

Sometimes if you're very quiet,

you can hear the noises of
the woods penetrate the night.

It's probably just the wind

but sometimes it really sounds
like an Indian drum beat.

Soft and low.

It's kind of creepy.

Chief Dohate on the warpath.

All right.

Let's just, let's take a break
from the stories right now.

How about we have some pizza,
right?

Let's have some pizza.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Let's do that, all right.

fuck?

[upbeat music]

Chase, are you checking me
out?

[all laughing]


No, no way.

It's okay, it happens all the
time.

[girls cheering]

All right guys, I think
I'm gonna go check on Eddie

and make sure he didn't
set the forest on fire?

You want me to go with you?

That's okay.

I think you should stay
here and work on your game.

You know what I mean.

I think I'm gonna make sure
Adrianna doesn't get lost.

Bye boys.

See ya.

Did you see that?

Adrianna?

See me make a total ass of
myself?

You totally did not
pick up on the clues, man.

She's into you.


Are you both clueless
like, like that clueless?

Adrianna just likes taunting you
guys.

You don't know anything,
Becky.

Oh really?

Take a look around.

Where are the other girls right
now?

They're both with Eddie.

It doesn't take a genius
to pick up on the,

what did you just call them,
Javon?

Clues?

â™ª Come on baby light my fire â™ª

â™ª Come on baby light my fire â™ª

â™ª Come on baby light my fire â™ª

â™ª Come on baby light my fire â™ª

Oh wait, wrong song.

â™ª Come on baby light my â™ª

â™ª Adrianna light my fire â™ª

Oh, good one, park boy.

â™ª Adrianna â™ª

You really wanna light my fire.

Oh really, is that your thing?

Yeah.

Yeah?

You look beautiful tonight.

Thank you.

As always.

Okay, all right, buddy, easy.

Why?

You're drunk.

No, I'm just having fun.

Yeah?

You're always having fun.

That's the life.

I know.

[suspenseful music]

Come on, baby, it's almost
Christmas.

Why don't you come sit on
Santa's lap?

Come on, get off of me.

Look, I built this beautiful
romantic fire just for you.

Oh yeah?

Yeah.

I also got this sweet peyote
right here.

Peyote?

Yeah, babe, Indian ganja.

Did you hear that?

Hear what?

Either this Peyote is talking
to me

or this place is really haunted.

Here, take a hit.

All right.

Gotta try, baby.

Breathe it in.

[Adrianna coughing]

We gotta honor this land

and break the Indian chief's
curse.

Oh yeah, and how do we do
that?

We have to show Chief Dohate

that no matter how hard you try,

you can't stop real love.

Love, Eddie?

Did you just say love?

Yeah, baby, love.

Yeah?

The Dohate's of the world
can keep those stupid rings.

If that ring was here right now

I would take it and shove it
straight up

his Indian ass

because there's nobody that
can tell me who I can't love.

Adrianna, I missed you so much.

Yeah, Eddie, that ship has
sailed.

Is this because of spring
break?

Are you really still mad about
that?

It was just some random
hookup, it meant nothing.

Yeah, but it did to me, you
meathead?

It was Cancun, babe.

Come on, that's practically
another country.

Okay, so then how
about that skank, Sheree,

from Hooters, you know,
a little closer to home?

What?

Yeah, you didn't think
I knew about that one,

now did you?

Adrianna, we both know that
you

are the only one that I care
about.

You know, Eddie, the truth is

you only care about yourself
and you always have.

You had your chance and you blew
it.


And that speech about love, real
touching.

What a bitch.

Hey, Eddie, you okay?

Yeah, your friend can be a
real bitch sometimes though.

Adrianna's okay.

She just doesn't know how to
handle a real man, but I do.

Oh yeah?

Fucking unbelievable.

Adrianna!

To me, myself and I.

[suspenseful music]

Hello?

Babe, listen, I'm really
sorry.

I'm gonna make this up to you.

Going after good girls now,
huh?

Listen, she came onto me.

Oh yeah?

You know you're the only girl
I want.

Poor guy, Eddie, messing up
every chance he gets, right?

You're really gonna
leave me just like this?

You've had one too many
chances.

Wait, you're just gonna keep
the ring?

Eddie, something is
seriously going on here.

What are you talking about?

I have taken this ring
off my hand multiple times

and it just keeps ending up
right back in the same spot.

That's impossible.

No, I am serious.

Something is seriously going on
here.

Fine.

Let's find out, let's test it.

[upbeat music]

Yo, let's go to that bonfire

and smoke some of that Peyote.

Nah, you guys go ahead.

What?

I'm gonna just work on my game
over here

for a little while.

Get your ass outside when
you're done?

In a little bit.

Did you hear anything I just
said?

Yeah, I heard everything you
just said.

I'm gonna work on my game right
now.

This, this ain't the game
you should be working on.

Very funny.

Why do I even try so hard with
him?

Let's go, Becky.

See, nothing.

I'm gonna to take this
ring back to the study.

These stories are just
going straight to your head.

Where is everybody?

Maybe they went off
exploring the property.

This place is huge after all.

Yeah, we have several acres.

Oh, they might be at the
tennis courts around back.

Wait, wait, hold the fuck up.

You got a bowling alley and
tennis courts?

Yeah, I'll show you.

They probably headed over there.

Are you coming?

I'll meet you guys.

Excuse me?

Hello?

Can I help you?

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
disturb you.

I didn't know there was anybody
here.

Okay, well, it's my job to be
here.

Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

May I ask who you are?

May I ask who you are

and what exactly are you doing
in my room

and on this property?

Well, like I said, I, I didn't
know.

there was anybody here and
I'm a friend of Chase's.

Oh yeah, okay.

Well, Chase is not allowed to
have guests.

Oh.

Really, I didn't know that, I'm
sorry.

Yes.

So, earlier today I saw all of
you arrive.

And I'll have, you know,
the Larson's hired me

to be the new groundskeeper.

Oh, okay.

What exactly are you doing
with this?

Are you doing some type of
research on the property?

I'm just reading about it,
that's all.

Well, you need to know that
this home

was built on sacred tribal
burial grounds.

Well, I did read something
about that,

but where exactly was the burial
ground?

Right here!

You're standing on it.

They built right on top of it?

Yes, that is right.

Of course they did.

For many years, this family
has harmed and humiliated

the heritage of the native
Americans that belong here.

And one day they're going to
pay!

What is that?

What exactly is that, what did
you do?

Who's out there?

We didn't do anything, I don't
know

We didn't do anything, I don't
know.

[siren sounding]

Good evening.

Is there something I can
help you with, Officer?

Well, the Larson's asked me to
come here

and check on Chase.

Is he here?

Well, he probably is
around here somewhere.

I can, I can go look for him.

By the way, Mr. Greene,
the new grounds keeper.

Oh, there's a new grounds
keeper?

Oh yeah.

I didn't realize they had
anybody since Mr. Jenkins.

Oh yeah.

I think he's at the tennis
courts, I can get him.

No that's okay, thanks anyway.

I can see Mr. Greene has
everything under control here.

You guys have a good night.

Yeah, I do.

I'm gonna get going too, yeah.

You kid's behave.

Yeah, okay, we will, we will.

[car engine revving]

Oh, wow.

Put this back.

Oh, no way!

I always wanted to try one of
these on.

Oh goodness, I need a weapon.

Oh, look at this.

Eddie's on a war path.

[Eddie yelling Indian chants]

Oh, gosh.

What's so special about
this damn ring anyways?

I'm Chief Dohate and I curse
this ring.

Anybody that touches it

and I'll cut your damn hand off.

Who was that?

Yo, Chase, was that you?

Yo, Chase.

Man, where is everybody?

[owls hooting]

Dude, this place creeps
me the fuck out, bro.

I told you, you can hear the
crying

out in the woods sometimes.


to get the lights back.

Javon, are you okay?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Let's get the fuck out of here,
man.

[fire crackling]

Hey dudes!

Get your asses over here.

This peyote's not gonna smoke
itself.

Yo, can I please have some of
that?

Of course, bro.

Yo, this place is freaking me
out.

Eddie, where are Adrianna and
Kayla?

We thought they were with you.

They were with me earlier.

You know what I mean?

Such a gentlemen.

Hey, have you guys been Kayla?

I can't find her anywhere.

No.

I didn't think you'd be
wanting to see her for a while.

Okay, asshole.

She's drunk and have you
actually [indistinct] her.

Maybe she's with Becky
somewhere.

No, she's not with me,

but you know, I gotta go
decompress, so

I'll look for her while I'm
gone.

Okay.

Ooh, beer, beer?

Yes.

Yes.

Gotcha.

You don't need to worry about
me.

Yes, leave this here.

Do you think she went
to the tennis court?

I truthfully don't know.

When did you see her last?

I mean, it's been a while.

in the bowling alley.

I haven't seen her
since she was with me.

[Javon whistling]

[suspenseful music]

[Javon whistling]

the devil can come calling.

[Damon laughing]

[Javon choking]

Javon.

Where the hell are you?

So Chase, what's your
favorite type of magic?

Well, my favorite type is card
magic.

But specialty is making
things appear and disappear.

How did you do that?

Let's try something a little
bit harder.

Okay.

So, now you can see

we've got a lot of
different options, right?

A lot of different options.

Uh, huh?

So, I'm gonna have you
pick out two instead of one.

I'm gonna have you pick out two.

Okay.

All I want you to do is
just hold up one finger.


You can just drop it down on any
card.


Got it, okay.

Take that one and take
the one next to it too.

see it?

Sure, which ones do you have?

So, four of diamonds and 7 of
clubs.

Four diamonds and a seven of
clubs.

Now these two cards,
could I use your sleeve?

Sure.

Okay, like that, perfect.

I'm gonna take these two,

and put them right inside there.


Okay, now with your other
hand,

can you take out one and
leave the other one inside?

Let's see which one you got?


Four of diamonds.

So what was the other one?


Seven of clubs.

Watch the four diamonds.

One, two, three.

Looks like the seven of clubs.

What?

Did you just switch those?

Check inside.

insane.

Seriously.

But that's not my specialty.


I said that my specialty

was making things appear and
disappear.

Watch this seven of
clubs, it just disappears.

Like that.

Seven to clubs is gone.

Oh my God.

Not just the seven of clubs.

Also, the entire deck has
disappeared.

All right, that was seriously
amazing.

I don't understand how
you did any of that.

Really crazy.

Remember, if you make a card,

like the seven of clubs
disappear,

you've always got to
make it reappear, right?

Right?

Check back in your sleeve.

I don't even know what to say.

Okay, now you gotta spill all
the beans

and tell me exactly how you did
that.

I can't tell you.

You have to.

Wow, okay then.

That was amazing.

I don't know how you
did any of that stuff.

Seriously, it's crazy.

Hey, you guys, did Javon come
in yet?

No, we haven't seen him.

Weird, he wasn't outside.

That is weird.

Okay, magic man.

Enough with the tricks.

What are you talking about?

Making things disappear and
reappear.

You really had me freaked out at
first.

No matter how many times
I take off this ring,

it just magically keeps
ending up back on my hand.

Adrianna, I swear I didn't do
that.

Right.

I don't even know how
to do something like that.

You're good, I just watched
it.

It's the ring, it's chosen
you.

What the hell are you
talking about, Becky?

Well, according to ancient
legend,

if the ring ever wound up
back with the white men

it would find its way back
through her native bloodstream.

Okay, all of that, that you're
reading,

it's just Hocus Pocus bullshit.

None of that's even true.

Also, I'm only part Native
American.

It just has to be in your
bloodstream.

When you put the ring on you
activated it.

Okay, enough with this
damn book already, seriously.

Adrianna's right.

We're getting ahead of
ourselves.

Let's just try and find Javon
and Kayla.

Yeah, that sounds like a plan
to me.


I didn't turn them off.

[suspenseful music]

Kayla?

[Adrianna screaming]

Get it off me!

Just get it off!

[Adrianna screaming]

Hey, listen.

I'm sure there's an
explanation for all of this.

Oh, like what Eddie?

Where the hell is Kayla and
Javon?

I don't know.

They're probably out
messing around in the woods.

You know Kayla.

Okay, so what's your
explanation for this damn ring

which I can't even get off my
finger now.

All right, everyone,
let's just calm down.

We'll figure this out together.

You know, you seem a little
too calm

if you ask me, Chase.

What are you talking about,
Eddie?

What, you think you can scare
Adrianna

with all your magic bullshit?

So you can just be the
hero that saves her?

You're getting out of line
here.

Am I?

Or do I have it all right?

What are you doing, man?

Eddie, just please calm down.

No, I won't calm down.

If you do anything else to scare
her,

I swear to God.

Okay, Eddie, just stop it.

This is not helping anybody.

I warned you.

All right, you guys look,

I don't know about you,

but I really could just
use a drink right now

just to calm my nerves down.

Come on, babe.

Let's go back by the fire back.

I'm sure Javon and Kayla are
back by now.

[sharp horror music]

Chief Dohate cut off
his own daughter's hand.

What a royal asshole

Hello?

Oh God.

Becky?

Jesus Christ, Chase,
you scared me after that.

Sorry, I didn't wanna disturb
you.

I just wanted to make
sure you had a towel.

Oh, okay, thanks.

Hey, Chase.


Do you believe in ghosts?

Why would you ask that?

Well, you believe in magic.

I mean like what's the
difference really?

Besides, I think the curse of
chief Dohate

does haunt these woods.

I don't think so.

But what about what you said
about,

you know, before, about
hearing the drum beats?

I was just messing around.

I think that this book has
started...

Hey wait, I wasn't finished.

Did you know that in the next
county over,

at the Silver Lake Casino,

the descendants of
Aiyana and Dohate's tribe

live and work there?

Yeah?

Well, they can't be very
happy with you guys, can they?

In their mind, it's the white
bred

Larson family squatting on their
land.

Whoa.

And what about that ring too?

Does that actually belong to you
guys?

Or did you take that too?

Becky, take it easy.

My family's totally cool with
that casino.

They make a lot of money off of
the guests

that stay at Liberty Manor.

As for the ring, I don't know.

My dad's really protective of
it.

He never takes it outta the
case.

It's like an antique.

This is my home you're talking
about.

Sorry.

I mean, there are some Indians

that try to claim this land as
their own

but my family owns this
property fair and square.

To the richest go the spoils I
guess.

Besides, even if there was a
curse

it worked out in your favor.

You know, sometimes I think

maybe there really is a curse.

Anyways, I think we're both
getting a little freaked out

by these stories, so...

You're probably right.

We should just relax,
it is winter break.

You're right.

I'm probably just, you
know, give me 30 minutes.

I just need to detox from
my, my chemistry final.

All right, take your time.

Thanks.

Look, I know you think
I'm crazy right now,

but something is really going on
here.

Fuck that guy.

I don't think Chase had
anything to do with this.

How do you explain it?

I don't know, dude.

How does this ring just
keep getting on my hand.

I took this ring off and
I put it back in the study

and it just keeps ending
up back on my hand

over and over and over again.

I know and I'm telling you

Chase has to be up to this.

There's something else going
on here.

He's the only one that knows
magic.

This has to be magic.

This is not magic.

Magic, doesn't work that way.

Then how does it work?

How do you explain this?

I don't know how to explain
this.

This whole place, this whole
house,

the story, the burial ground,

everything that's
happening to us, around us.

None of it makes sense.

No, it doesn't.

I just wanna go, dude, I just
wanna go.

[mysterious music]

[Becky screaming]

[water splashing]


[Becky screaming]

This water is now your hell.

Do you hear that?

Hear what?

Shh, listen.

What is that?

Eddie, what's going on?

What the hell?

Oh my God.

Stay back!

Don't make me use it!

Stay back!

What's happening?

Oh God, Becky!

Becky?

Oh my God!

Oh my God!

you!

Eddie!

Eddie!

Eddie, oh my God!

Oh my God!


Stop it, just stop!


Not so fast.

[Eddie choking]

[both screaming]

No!

[Chase choking]


[Adrianna breathing heavily]

She has the ring.

What are you doing?

[Adrianna screaming]

Get off me, please.

Please, please!

[Adrianna screaming]

[Adrianna muffled screaming]

Relax and I won't hurt you.

I don't wanna hurt you.

[Adrianna breathing heavily]

Just do as you're told.

Get the fuck off of me!

Relax!

My father has been expecting
you.

I'll take her from here.

Okay.

Have a seat.

Thank you for coming, Adrianna.

I don't think I had much of a
choice.

Is that for me?

What?

Let me see it, please.

See what?

My ring you are wearing.

It won't come off, I've tried.

It will now, try.

Many of my people have died for
this ring.

Many of mine too.

Thanks to you, I'm guessing.

Collateral damage, I'm afraid

Your friends desecrated hallowed
ground.

Our forefathers tilled the soil,

fed our hungry and buried our
slaughtered,

and what they call deep
irony and great disrespect.

Liberty Manor Estate.

The Larson family owned that
land.

Bullshit!

This land was taken from
my people, illegally.

For more than 200 years,
we've been regulated to this.

This God-forsaken casino.

A government handout.

Do you have any idea what this
does

to the collective psyche of a
nation?

A once proud nation of warriors,

leaders, and heroes?

I'm sorry about what happened.

Oh, you're sorry?

Isn't that rich?

Everybody's sorry.

They, they take my land.

They take my heritage.

You know what we get in return?

What?

The jungle room, a guttered
casino,

a lot of hollow apologies.

This ring represents
all that has gone wrong

these last 200 years.

As Chief Tocho, I owe my people

the chance to honor their
dead the proper way.

I'm sorry for what happened
to your people but I...

Our people.

Excuse me?

You see, the ring chose you.

The ring brought you to me.

The only way to break that
curse is with true native blood.

You do know somewhat about
your heritage, don't you?

I was adopted.

Well, the one thing
you should know, child,

man does not own the land

any more than an Eagle owns the
sky.

The land is a hollowed ground.

And while not owned, as
the white man defines it.

It will again be occupied by my
tribe.

How do you plan on doing that?

More bloodshed, more killings?

I hope not.

The only thing that stopped us
until now has been this ring.

For generations it's haunted my
people.

What are you gonna do with it?

This rings domain belongs to
no man.

I don't understand.

Bury the ring, bury the curse.

This ring will no longer reign
supreme,

but be given back to the Earth.

What are you gonna do with me?

Kill me?

No, of course not.

Curse of the ring is broken,
you're to thank for that.

It's time we write a new
chapter.

No more bloodshed, no more
death.

Unless of course you and
Javon care to make trouble.

Javon, he's alive?

The ring carefully chooses

who it needs to pay it's debts.

Didn't want you or Javon.

Now with the ring no
longer in our possession,

the tragic events from last
night

have no ties to me or my people.

I was quite careful about that.

You will take this.

I don't want your hush money.

Let me remind you there
are four dead bodies

at a party that you were at.

The only one missing is you.

And then there's this,
the security footage.

I didn't do any of this.

What kind of fucking sick
game are playing here?

Of course you didn't,
sweetheart.

But how do you plan on
explaining that to the police

that are currently questioning
Javon?

Let me start again.

My guys will bring you back to
the house.

You will come running through
the woods

claiming you were tied up and
beaten

and you just got free.

Damon, the man that was
shot dead in front of you

will take the fall for all the
events that occurred tonight.

Mr. Greene, the new grounds
keeper

will collaborate the story

and take responsibility for
shooting.

The footage of you will be
destroyed.

And I will offer the Larson's
an offer they can't refuse.

To sell their property that's
filled with horrible memories.

[sinister music]

Help!

Help!

Please help.

Who are you?

What is this place?

Who are you?

What do you want from me?

[neck snapping]

[intense music]

What!

You were never gonna pay me my
money.

It seems betrayal is not
only a white man's trait.

[Damon laughing]

I want my money!

Listen carefully, Chief,

when you dance with the devil,

it's the devil that picks the
tune.

Adios!

[soft horror music]

[women screaming]

Who am I?

I am the companion.

The black wind.

I am Damon.

[woman whimpering]

[woman screaming]

[upbeat music]

How are you?

So how have you been?

Where have you been?

I know, I'm sorry.

I think I just needed a
little bit of time, you know?

It just got really hard there
for awhile.

I get that, I, I definitely
understand.

So, we should do something this
weekend.

Not anything that has to
do with any creepy masks

or weirdos or anything like that

but, I don't know, nothing, have
fun.

That actually sounds
like it could be nice,

but there's actually something

I gotta go take care of though
first.

So, I think I'm gonna go head
and do that,

but I'll be here this weekend
for sure.

Okay, yeah, that sounds good.

[mysterious music]

So, here you are.

What took you so long to find
me?

You bastard!

Your hand shakes 'cause you
have doubt.

You ain't gonna pull that
trigger.

Fuck you, I don't have any
doubt.

You killed my friends.

Your friends were standing in
my way.

And you'd kill me too
if given the chance.

You know what, honey,
if I wanted you dead,

we wouldn't be having this
conversation right now, would we?

You liked killing them?

Well, that should make no
difference

because killing comes
easier for some people.

Like me.

It was never supposed to be
like this,

you promised that you
never would've done that.

It was never supposed to be like
this.

The ring had to be secured

and your friends got in the way.

Stop saying that.

Fuck you, stop saying that!

I needed the ring

and I couldn't have gotten it
without your help, Adrianna.

You will be compensated.

I'm not afraid of you, not
anymore.

I don't want your blood money.

Adrianna, put the gun down.

The chief put a bounty on your
head.

I kill you and bring him the
mask

and I'll have all the
money I'll ever need.

You really think the
chief is gonna let you live?

First the ring and now the mask.

An evil wind blows through him.

The curse is not buried
in the sand, my child.

I'll take my chances.

Adrianna, the curse is alive.

An evil wind blows through you
too.

The weakness of the enemy,
creates our strength.

from the strength, we can
thrive in life and in death.

After all, all those before
us are not really dead,

their hearts can beat in the
souls that they leave behind.

There is honor in death.

There is dignity in passing
from this world into the next,

after all the tragedy
of life is not death.

The tragedy of life is what
we let die inside of us

while we live.
