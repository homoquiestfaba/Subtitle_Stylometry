<b>[Wind Howling]</b>

<b>[Laughing]
Ayear younger than I was for my first.</b>

When can I have a stag?
[Scoffs] A stag?

<b>- Come on!
Tell me again what you said last week.</b>

<b>[Wind Howling]</b>

<b>Let that be a reminder to you.

<b>I got it. I got it.</b>


Why would they join
against the Irish?

<b>- Because someone has to stand up to them.
You?</b>

<b>Me, Marke, all the tribes.
We can't resist alone.</b>

<b>- I could.
[Chuckles] My little warrior.</b>

<b>We have to be careful.</b>


<b>Come home without something
for your lady, you'll have hell to pay.</b>

<b>- Can I?
[Man] Of course you can, boy.</b>

<b>- The Angles have arrived, my lord-
[Duck Quacking]</b>

<b>As well as the Celts, my fellow Jutes
and the Saxons.</b>

<b>Good. With Marke...</b>

<b>- we'll all be here.
Yeah. It's a great day.</b>

<b>- Let us hope so.
Yeah.</b>

<b>Thanks.</b>

<b>[Goat Bleating]</b>

<b>We heard the news.
Pray for a son.</b>

<b>- Mother.
[Father] Welcome to Tantallon.</b>

<b>I made this for you.</b>


<b>Friends.</b>

<b>Look at us, the tribes of Britain.</b>

<b>Divided.</b>

<b>Weak.Just as the Irish like us.</b>


But if we were one land- united-

<b>we would outnumber them 2- to- 1.</b>

<b>We could defeat them once and for all.
That's why we're here today.</b>

<b>- To sign this treaty of unification.
Who would be king?</b>

<b>The strongest among us...</b>

<b>- Lord Marke.
[Murmuring]</b>

<b>Look, if you're happy sending
all your gold to Ireland...</b>

<b>living as slaves,
by all means, do nothing.</b>

<b>If we were happy doing that,
we would never have risked coming here.</b>

<b>[Chattering]</b>

<b>Friends, my wife is with child.
My heart tells me it's a boy.</b>

<b>I want him to grow old
in a land where all of us-</b>

<b>all the tribes- Pict...</b>

<b>Celt, Angle, Jute, Saxon-
are at peace.</b>


<b>This island has not known unity
since the Romans left.</b>

<b>That is why I sign this treaty.</b>

<b>- And why should we follow you?
Perhaps, Wictred...</b>

<b>because your last attempt
to form an alliance...</b>

<b>without the knowledge of half
the barons in this room has failed.</b>

<b>- [Laughing]
[Man] Alarm!</b>

<b>- [Man #2] What for?
The Irish are here!</b>

[Screaming]
[Shouting]

<b>- Take all your men, guard the women.
But you won't have enough-</b>

Go!

<b>[Clattering]</b>

<b>Quickly! Tristan!
Back this way. Hurry!</b>

<b>- [Horse Whinnies]
[Man] Move down the ranks!</b>

<b>[Shouting]</b>

<b>- [Pounding]
How did they know?</b>

<b>- [Pounding Continues]
[Shouting]</b>


Tristan!
No!

Let me fight!

<b>[Shouts]</b>

<b>- [Feet Trampling]
[Panting]</b>

Please, don't hurt him!

<b>Father.</b>

<b>[Thuds]</b>

[Screaming]
No!



<b>[Grunting]</b>

<b>Tristan. Tristan.</b>

<b>[Woman]
No!</b>

<b>[Man Speaking
Foreign Language]</b>

## [Drumbeat]

<b>She's with the gods now, Isolde.
You'll see her again someday.</b>

Will I?

<b>Morholt returns.</b>

What news of the treaty?

<b>Good, Morholt.</b>

<b>Good.</b>

<b>[Woman]
Your mother loved you so much, Isolde.</b>

Why did she die, Bragnae? Why?

<b>It was an ill vapor that took her...</b>

<b>a fever.</b>

<b>No. It was her heart.</b>

<b>[Horses Approaching]</b>

<b>[Man]
The Irish have been here.</b>

<b>[Baby Crying]</b>

<b>[Coughing]</b>


Your husband?

<b>Oh. Oh, Sister, I'm so sorry.</b>

<b>[Sister]
The executions lasted a day.</b>

<b>They made sport of us.</b>

<b>A whole generation of men.</b>

Who's this?

<b>[Marke]
Tristan, son of Aragon.</b>

<b>We're his family now.</b>

<b>I have a son about your age.</b>

<b>Melot. Melot?</b>

<b>Melot, this is Tristan.</b>

What shall we do, my lord?

<b>Rebuild.</b>

<b>[Man]
Three, four.</b>

<b>- One, two-
Don't hold back.</b>

Come on!

Come on!

<b>Three, four.</b>

<b>Tristan won't fight me.
Look, he's scared!</b>

<b>[Man]
Three, four.</b>

<b>One, two, three-</b>

<b>- Still won't fight?
He's got the heart of a lion.</b>

<b>Just needs some time.</b>

Why'd you take off your helmet?
You going to cry?

<b>My father died too,
but you don't see me crying.</b>

<b>- Melot.
That's right, run.</b>

<b>Find another trapdoor
to hide under, coward.</b>


<b>Tristan!</b>

<b>Tristan! Tristan.
We found something.</b>

<b>Come on, this way.
Quick, come on.</b>

<b>- You are gonna love it.
You'll love it.</b>

<b>Yeah, l- I found this trapdoor.</b>

Who found a trapdoor?
[Laughs]

<b>All right, Simon.
Well, you tell us how you found it.</b>

<b>Look at that.</b>

Where does this lead?

<b>You'll see.</b>

<b>Well, I like that vase.</b>

<b>Think I'll have that.</b>

<b>We always knew the castle
was built on Roman foundations...</b>

<b>but we didn't think
anything was left.</b>

<b>Must be a burial crypt
or something.</b>

<b>Here we are.
Bottom of the keep.</b>

Who else knows about this?

<b>- Nobody.
Good.</b>

<b>[Man] These savages have rebuilt
the castle in Cornwall...</b>

<b>only now it's made of stone.</b>

For Cornwall's next tribute,
I want slaves-young ones-

<b>their future.</b>

<b>If Marke resists,
have Morholt crush him.</b>

<b>- My king.
Morholt.</b>

<b>I have led your armies
to victories far and near.</b>

<b>I've made you rich and powerful.</b>

<b>Yes, you have.
You have been most loyal.</b>

When I return from Cornwall,
I was hoping-

What would please you?

<b>A wife.</b>

<b>It's dark in an hour.</b>

What do you think
is really out there?

<b>Britannia.</b>

<b>The old Roman lands.</b>

<b>A world full of evil and grief.</b>

<b>I want to see it.</b>

Do you know what the future
looks like, Bragnae?

<b>[Bragnae]
I see the life you were meant for.</b>

<b>Your father will speak with you.</b>

Am I just a chattel
to be traded at your pleasure?

Do I have no say in my own life?

<b>You have a duty to your king.</b>

<b>You are my father.</b>

<b>Then obey me, Daughter.</b>


Your father has given you the news?

<b>- And do you welcome it?
I accept it.</b>

<b>You know, we're more alike
than you might guess.</b>

How so?

<b>I, too, dabble in elixirs.</b>

<b>[Sword Unsheathes]</b>

<b>Poison. It's from
the livers of puffer fish.</b>

<b>Just a taste...
paralyzes all the senses.</b>

So if the blade doesn't kill-

<b>Rendered safe by thistle and bark.</b>

And do you know
the antidote for this?

<b>Yohimbine.</b>

<b>Makes a hard man even harder.</b>

<b>The only cure: Wild abandon.</b>

<b>Till our wedding day.</b>

<b>I'm to Cornwall to deal with rebels.</b>

<b>Release them.</b>

<b>Hey. Around. Around.</b>


Off me!

<b>- Go find Tristan.
Leave her!</b>

<b>Take him there. Get a rope.</b>

<b>Anyone foolish enough
to interfere in any way...</b>

<b>- shall suffer the same fate.
No.</b>

<b>Please don't. Don't.
Take me. No! No!</b>

<b>- [Gags]
[Screaming] Widseth!</b>

<b>Widseth!</b>

<b>If there are any more attacks,
we shall put our guests...</b>

<b>- to death and raze this entire land.
[Sobbing]</b>

<b>Take the horses.</b>

<b>- [Marke] When would you strike?
At once.</b>

<b>- Throw everything we have at them.
They're hoping you'll do that.</b>

<b>On horse they outnumber us 2-to-1 .
You'll lead the men straight to their deaths.</b>

<b>- So we do nothing?
Donnchadh would like that even more...</b>

<b>me to lose face in front
of the other tribes.</b>

<b>No. We must act.</b>

<b>It must be decisive.</b>

<b>But we cannot act alone.</b>

So have the good men of York
come to fight with us?

Hmm? Or the Saxons of Wessex?

<b>My men don't want
to follow a Pict into battle...</b>

<b>let alone one leading
a pack of Angles and Celts.</b>

Then why are you here?

<b>I thought Tristan
should let me command his men.</b>

<b>- I make it my habit to follow no one.
Except Marke?</b>

<b>Marke delivered me from that palace
when I was a boy. You ran.</b>

<b>So you can understand
when I think ofkings, I think ofhim.</b>

<b>- And when I think of cowards-
[Marke] They're one day from
their boats on the Roman road.</b>

Now, who will ride out
with Tristan to fight them?

What is your plan, Tristan?

<b>I need our two fastest runners.</b>

<b>- [Man] There they go! After them!
[Whinnies]</b>

<b>Hold off.</b>

Halt!

Go around!


<b>Morholt! They're back.</b>

<b>- [Laughing]
They've got a head.</b>

[Shouting]
It's a trap!

Kill the slaves!



[Horse Shrieks]

<b>- Simon.
[Grunts]</b>

<b>We're gonna get you home.</b>

<b>Simon.</b>

<b>I don't want to die.</b>


<b>Tristan.</b>

<b>I can't feel my legs or my hands.</b>

<b>Poison.</b>

<b>A second boat.</b>

<b>Tristan.</b>

<b>[Melot]
He shall have a king's service.</b>

<b>Farewell, Tristan of Aragon.</b>

<b>Death to the Irish.</b>

<b>[Wind Howling]</b>

<b>When the Irish came to Cornwall...</b>

<b>and my father surrendered...</b>

<b>you spared a dozen out of a hundred.</b>

<b>I am even less kind.</b>

<b>The leader and three
will take this message home.</b>

As for the rest-

<b>- [Thunderclap]
[Chattering]</b>

<b>Victory.</b>

And Tristan?

<b>Simon too.</b>

<b>Did I love him like a son...</b>

<b>- or did I misuse him for my own purposes?
He knew.</b>

<b>[Sniffles]
He knew.</b>

<b>[Wind Howling]</b>

<b>- [Flapping]
[Gasps]</b>

<b>- Where are we going?
Away.</b>

<b>Are you afflicted, child?
Speak to me.</b>

<b>Your father will find us
and have my head.</b>

<b>You are my charge. Please.</b>

<b>I am no one's charge.</b>

<b>You are.</b>

<b>And you will be Morholt's lady.</b>

And live a loveless life like my mom?

What's that?

Where?

<b>Isolde, wait. Don't.</b>

[Speaking Foreign Language]

<b>Isolde, don't.</b>

<b>- Isolde!
It's a man.</b>

Dead?

Alive! Bragnae, help me!

[Foreign Language]
Help me!

<b>- Isolde.
Quickly!</b>


<b>Start a fire.</b>

<b>- Oh.
Quickly.</b>

<b>His heart falters.</b>

<b>- What are you doing?
He needs heat. Now.</b>

<b>Get your clothes off, quickly.</b>

<b>Hurry.</b>

Quickly! Smell that?
Smell the poison?

<b>When he warms,
we'll need thistle and bark.</b>

<b>I've not been naked
with a man for 15 years.</b>

<b>[Isolde]
Hello.</b>

<b>You've been sleeping a long time.</b>

<b>You're in Ireland.
Did you know that?</b>

<b>Shh.</b>

<b>It's all right.</b>

<b>You're safe here. No one knows.</b>

<b>Don't be scared.Just sleep.</b>

<b>Sleep.</b>

<b>[Hoofbeats Approaching]</b>

<b>Oh.</b>


<b>- No!
It's all right. You don't need that.</b>

<b>I forgot to tell him about you.</b>

<b>I'll wait outside
with the other beasts.</b>

<b>- You said no one else knew.
Sorry.</b>

<b>She's my maid, sworn to silence.</b>

<b>Um, lie down, please.</b>

Please?

<b>It's good you're remembering things.
This might sting.</b>

Do you remember anything else?

The boat I found you in?

How you got this?

<b>Too many questions.
There. Keep that dry.</b>

<b>Here are clothes, bread.</b>

<b>You have water and fire.</b>

<b>The ocean's outside
if you wish a bath.</b>

<b>You won't know where you're going,
so please don't try to leave.</b>

<b>Just trust me.</b>

Why are you doing this?

<b>I'll be back.</b>

<b>This is a dangerous game
you're playing.</b>

<b>- He's English, Isolde.
And we've got him prisoner.</b>

Under no circumstances
tell him your name, you hear me?

<b>I thought you wished
to escape this place.</b>

Did you hear me?

<b>- [Whispering] You'll do no such thing.
He'll need more food tomorrow.</b>

<b>He's not of your concern.</b>

<b>- You've been away.
Oh, you noticed.</b>

<b>- Yes, I have a bit.
Where?</b>

<b>Bragnae and I were spying
the convent at Brittas.</b>

<b>- Seeking sanctuary?
Some women need it.</b>

<b>You'll find no refuge
in the new religion.</b>

<b>Your place is here, with Morholt.</b>

Any word of my betrothed?

<b>Overdue.</b>

<b>But comforted, no doubt,
that you yearn for him.</b>

<b>[Wind Howling]</b>

What's your name?

<b>Oh, I think it's better
we don't bother with names.</b>

How can I thank you
if I don't have your name?

<b>You just did.</b>

<b>If you insist, my name is Bragnae.</b>

<b>If you insist, my name is Bragnae.</b>

<b>I'm a lady-in-waiting at the court.
My parents are dead.</b>

<b>My mother, she's the source
of the kindness you find so puzzling.</b>

<b>My father would have
left you where you fell.</b>

<b>I'm Tristan of Aragon.</b>

<b>Well, Tristan of Aragon...</b>

<b>I'd guess about you too,
but I think I've already seen everything.</b>

<b>Sir, I hope you appreciate the risks...</b>

<b>we are taking and will honor us
by leaving as soon as you are able.</b>

<b>She likes me.</b>

<b>She's right though. You do risk.</b>

<b>Here. And what of your parents?</b>

[Clears Throat]

<b>They also died when I was a child.</b>

Of what?

<b>A different type of Irish kindness.</b>

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

Tomorrow then?

<b>Tomorrow.</b>

<b>[Isolde] "There she who bore you
brought you forth.</b>

<b>"Set me as a seal upon your heart...</b>

<b>"as a seal upon your arm...</b>

<b>for love is as strong as death."</b>

<b>Ridiculous.</b>

<b>I happen to believe what that says.</b>

Don't you think there's more to life?

<b>- [Tristan] Than what?
Something more than duty and death.</b>

Why be capable of feelings
if we're not to have them?

<b>Why long for things
if they're not meant to be ours?</b>

<b>Oh, don't listen to me.</b>

<b>You're so sure of things.</b>

<b>Your certainty, it's-it's like armor.
I wish I had that.</b>

<b>- Why would you need it?
The joy of being a lady.</b>

Wanting something I can't have-

<b>a life of my own.</b>

<b>Time you must leave now.</b>

<b>I'll follow you later.</b>

<b>You need a rest...</b>

<b>in case your betrothed
would want to see you.</b>

<b>[Door Opens, Closes]</b>

You're promised?

<b>Yes.</b>

What's he like?

<b>Dark, tall, nearly twice your size.</b>

<b>An absolute gentleman.</b>

<b>I thought...</b>

earlier when you spoke
of wanting something you can't have-

<b>I didn't know what
I was talking about.</b>

<b>Outside, just past that bluff,
there is a boat.</b>

<b>That's how you should go
when you leave.</b>

<b>You should go soon.</b>


How do you feel?

<b>I don't know.</b>



<b>[Man]
It's Lord Bodkin!</b>


<b>Tristan! They found your boat.</b>

<b>At this very moment,
the king himself is scouring the coasts.</b>

<b>He'll find you. He finds everyone.
The tide is coming. You must go.</b>

<b>Come with me.</b>

<b>- Come with me.
I can't.</b>

<b>Why not? Please.</b>

<b>Tristan, we both know this can't be.
We've known it from the start.</b>

<b>That doesn't mean
it isn't true. It is.</b>

<b>It just cannot be.</b>

<b>I want to know that you're alive somewhere
and thinking of me from time to time.</b>

<b>I want to know that there's more to this life,
and I can't know that if they kill you.</b>

<b>Please.</b>

<b>Go.</b>

<b>A Cornish warrior may be ashore.</b>

<b>Beware. We seek him as I speak.</b>

<b>Hopefully, it's just
his rotted corpse we'll find...</b>

<b>for he has slain your betrothed.</b>

<b>Morholt is dead, fallen in battle.</b>

Isolde?

<b>Bragnae, catch and comfort her.</b>

<b>- She is stunned.
As am I by her grief.</b>

<b>We should, uh-We should assault
the British straightaway.</b>

<b>Crush them with maximum force.</b>

Maximum force?

The one butchered by Marke's tribes?
Would that be the force you speak of?

<b>We'll not confront them again
until our numbers are refreshed.</b>

<b>And until then...</b>

<b>we'll have cunning divide them.</b>

Of what nature?

<b>A prize, perhaps.</b>

<b>What's this about a tournament?</b>

<b>Donnchadh.</b>

<b>He's offered his daughter
and the lands of Lionath...</b>

<b>as dowry to whichever
English tribe wins.</b>

<b>It's a clever way of setting us
against each other.</b>

<b>Well, the other barons
will see through that.</b>

<b>As baron of Wessex...</b>

<b>it's my duty to fight in this tournament
for my people.</b>

<b>- For yourself, you mean.
And what of the support you promised Tristan?</b>

<b>Tristan's dead.</b>

<b>My people have suffered enough.</b>

<b>They see the wealth of Lionath on offer.
That seems more real than any alliance.</b>

<b>- My mind is set.
And ours as well.</b>

<b>So be it.</b>

<b>You're weary. Let me rally our friends.
I'll lead them against Donn-</b>

<b>Melot, Melot, Melot,
Melot, Melot.</b>

<b>You're my blood...</b>

and you're a noble presence, but-

<b>[Man Shouting]</b>

<b>- [Man #2] He's back!
[Woman] He's alive!</b>

<b>- Tristan!
We thought you weren't alive.</b>

He's back! Lord Marke, it's Tristan!

<b>It can't be.</b>

<b>I saw you dead.</b>

<b>I am delivered.</b>

How?

How?

<b>[Chattering, Laughing]</b>

<b>##[Folk]</b>

<b>[Man]
Please, Tristan, tell us more.</b>

<b>Tristan, there must be a story.</b>

<b>A toast to Tristan...</b>

<b>- back from the dead.
[Man] Yeah, back from the dead.</b>

<b>Tristan, the Irish king offers his daughter
in tournament and divides all our tribes.</b>

<b>Whether for the power
or the wealth, half the barons...</b>

<b>- are sending champions to fight at Dunluce.
Tristan.</b>

<b>God knows what happened to him.</b>

<b>[Isolde's Voice]
"My face in thine eyes...</b>

<b>"thine in mine appears.</b>

<b>"And true plain hearts
do in the faces rest.</b>

<b>"Whatever dies was not mixed equally.</b>

<b>"If our two loves be one...</b>

<b>"or thou and I love so alike...</b>

<b>that none can slacken,
none can die. "</b>

<b>- [Marke] What?
It's the only way to keep the alliance alive.</b>

<b>I fail to see how fighting
with our partners keeps us allies.</b>

<b>Well, they're all going
to the tournament anyway.</b>

<b>By announcing you'll share the dowry
with every baron who remains loyal...</b>

<b>while in turn offering support
to whomever prevails...</b>

<b>- the others will be compelled
to follow you when you win it.
If we win.</b>

<b>If we lose, we could end up
following Wictred.</b>

<b>I'd need an infallible champion.</b>

<b>- Me.
[Laughs]</b>

<b>You're not yet healed.</b>

<b>Well, this trip will be my tonic.
I'll be ready.</b>

<b>You know I will.</b>

What's the source of this fervor?

<b>Let me go and win you a wife.</b>

<b>She can make peace
without spilling one drop of blood.</b>

<b>And maybe heal the wound
from which you still ache.</b>


<b>Truce.</b>

<b>You have safe passage.</b>

[Swords Clanging]

<b>You'll all go over there.</b>

How do I look?
How do you look?

Where's this princess?
What's her name, Isolde?

<b>I want to see what she looks like.</b>

<b>[Door Opens]</b>

<b>There. Almost done.</b>

<b>No, not quite.</b>

<b>If I'm a present, I should be fully wrapped.</b>

<b>- Name?
Lebourne of Bracht.</b>

<b>[Man Laughing]
I don't believe you.</b>

<b>- [Man #2] It's true.
[Rattles]</b>

<b>Name?</b>

<b>Ah, see how the bees
come to the honey.</b>

<b>- Name?
Tristan of Aragon.</b>

<b>- So he lives.
For the moment.</b>

Name?

<b>- [Purse Rattles]
Name?</b>

<b>Wictred of Glastonbury.</b>

<b>I fight with no champion in my stead.</b>

<b>Note that.</b>

Why Wictred?

<b>[Donnchadh] Because the barons
will never unite behind him.</b>

<b>- [Horn Blows]
[Cheering, Applause]</b>

You think she's got the pox?


<b>Since the dawn of time...</b>

<b>the knight has gathered
at tournaments.</b>

<b>Here he sharpens his skills,
settles his differences...</b>

<b>and proves his worthiness before God...</b>

<b>for only a true heart
can prevail in battle.</b>

<b>Warriors, begin!</b>

<b>[Cheering, Applause]</b>

<b>He's got him now.</b>

<b>- Make it look real.
What?</b>

I yield!


<b>Real enough, I hope.</b>

<b>- [Swords Clanging]
[Booing]</b>

<b>[Whistling]</b>

<b>Water? You did great.</b>


<b>- Yeah! [Laughs]

No!
