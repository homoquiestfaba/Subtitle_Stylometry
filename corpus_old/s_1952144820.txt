Thank you.

Okay, so I forgot.

Look what they did!

I couldn’t even sell it
to a cheese factory.

Hey, Dooley!
Check this out.

Its a modified M-16.
A company called...

Armaments 2000s
doin´ the retrofit.

Its supposed to be
for military use only.

Where did you hear that?
I saw it in a gun magazine.

Did you pick that up on the street?
Yeah.

Are you supposed to be messin’ with evidence?
No.

Give me that.
Go get me some coffee.

Well, Jerry Lee, so much
for the Brady Bill, huh?

Dooley? What are you doing here?
Hi, Captain.

Sighs
What happened?

Uh, well, there was a,
uh, equipment failure.

Equipment failure?
The bad guy had Air Jordan’s on. It was no contest.

What about Jerry Lee?
He needs four little Air Jordan’s too?

You mean they make those for dogs?
That was a rhetorical question.

You know, Captain, you should let people
know when you plan to be rhetorical,

cause your tone of voice
never changes.

You think you’re funny?
Sometimes.

This isn’t one of those times.
Jerry Lee, he just hit me!

Quit bein’ a smart-ass. Tell
me what happened. - Again!

The bad guy had
a full body armor on.

That should have given you the advantage.
It was that lightweight stuff.

What can I tell you?
The guy had a rocket up his ass.

What the hell is that?
This here?

Uh, this was the shooters.
This is a modified M-16.

A company named Armaments 2000
does the retrofit.

Its apparently
for military use only.

How do you know all that?
I’m trying to better myself by taking night seminars.

Ah, shut up, will you?
You better sit down. You look pale.

Probably because you hit me.
And give that dog there a drink of water.

Jerry Lee is fine,
and so am I.

You don’t look fine.
Sit down before you fall down.

Now. Detective Harris?
Yes.

Its the smog!
Take this to the lab and check it for prints, okay?

You know, Dooley,

every time you go someplace lately,
people try to kill you.

Well, I’m a popular guy.
Look, I’m serious here.

You’ve lost three suspects
in three weeks! - Come-

You are either out of your league...
I am not out of my league.

or you’ve lost a step.
What are you talking about, "lost a step"?

You should have taken
time off after Tracy died.

That has nothing to do with it, Captain.
Oh. Are you sure?

Absolutely sure.

When was the last time
you had a physical?

Physical. Is that the blood pressure,
when they do the-

Laughs, Whimpers

I want you both checked out.
You understand me?

I obviously cant
count on you anymore.

Hey!
What about my car?

Have your detailer look at it.
He can probably rub it out.

Rub it out?

I guess I can drive it at night.
Nobody’ll see it.

Come on, Jerry Lee.
Come on, get in.

My poor car.

Aw, he got my cup holder too.

Ah, you know what? Its my fault.

Woman Devon Lane, this is
my husband, Detective Dooley.

Dooley Nice to meet you. Devon
Oh, the pleasure is all mine.

Devon I’m so excited
Dooley Can we get some drinks over here?

"De

Dooley Devon. Sorry. What’s
with the tape recorder?

Devon I’m a writer. I tape
everything. Tracy Devon,

I just want to say that I see
real potential in your work.

Devon Potential? Really? Tracy Oh, yeah.

He’s been a cop a long time. Maybe he
can help you with some of that cop stuff.

Devon Would you? Dooley Well,
yeah, sure. You okay, honey?

Tracy Ill be fine. I’ll be
back in a few minutes. Excuse me.

Devon
Tracy told me you read my manuscript.

Dooley Yeah, I did. I
didn’t read the whole thing.

I read the first
and the last chapter.

That’s really
all I had time for.

Devon The first and last
chapters? Dooley I gotta tell ya,

uh, its-
it wasn’t really that real.

Devon It wasn’t real? Dooley No, it wasn’t
real. I didn’t believe a lot of the-

all that cop stuff you have in there-
the shootouts and the bank robbery.

That’s not really
how it happens.

Devon It wasn’t real? Dooley That’s all
right. It’s your first attempt, man.

Don’t worry about it.
You’ll get there.

Don’t worry about it.
You’ll get there.

Woman Any loss of appetite?
No, I’m eatin´ pretty well.

Not you, the dog.
Oh, uh-

No, he’s fine.

Okay, I’m gonna increase the speed and incline.
Why?

Thuds
Well, that’s the standard test for canines, Detective.

Oh.

Jerry Lee Whining
What?

I can hold the handrail.
Humans can hold the handrail.

All right,
all right, all right.

Have you noticed
any changes in him?

Yeah, he doesn’t chase the little chuck
wagon across the kitchen floor anymore.

Any loss of hearing
or smell?

Well, that depends on
what you mean by "any. "

Well, that depends on
what you mean by "any. "

Well, maybe sometimes,
a little bit.

Well, there’s nothing wrong with your dog.
Really?

He’s just suffering
from the effects of aging.

You should slow him down a bit.
Why?

Would you send your grandfather out
to try and do your job?

I wouldn’t send my grandfather
to microwave popcorn.

So why would you send out Jerry Lee?
Cause my grandfather’s too old.

So is Jerry Lee.
What do you mean? Look at him. He looks great.

Do you know that dogs are leading
longer and healthier lives these days?

Where did you hear that?
Seminar. At night. I try to better myself.

Oh, you’re trying to better yourself?
Maybe you should get a checkup.

You’ve got high blood pressure.
Your face is bright red.

That is a drinking problem!

Well, what do you know?
You’re a vet.

You both need to be
on special diets.

The same one? - No. You should
be on a low-fat, low-sodium diet.

The dog needs to be on
a senior maintenance meal plan.

Whining
What the hells that?

Lamb and rice
for older dogs.

It might give him some flatulence for a
week or so, but nothing to worry about.

Sighs Nothing for you to worry
about. I gotta live with the damn dog.

You trying to be funny?
No.

I forgot my wallet,
so can I write a check?

Do I get
any free samples?

Hey! Jeez!

Jerry Lee! Come here.
Lie down. Down.

Man
I just saved you 300 calories.

Who is this?
You should be drinking light beer.

Less filling,
and it wont slow you down.

And Dooley, you better pay attention
to the "wont slow you down" part.

I could have beat you
running backwards, old man.

What do you want?
Don’t tell me you haven’t figured it out yet, Detective.

Three times
in three weeks, Dooley.

I could have taken you out
anytime I wanted.

I want you to know how it feels to have
someone else control your destiny.

Jerry, down!
How it feels to have someone else destroy your life.

What do you want?
Its hard to lose a loved one.

Isn’t it, Dooley? But then,
sometimes life just has a way...

of kicking you in the face,
just when you think you’ve got it made.

Hey, why don’t you
come in.

You and I, we can have
a beer, we can chat.

And then
Ill bust your ass.

Took a shot at me.

Hit my beer.
Why didn’t you call it in?

I got another beer. But wait a minute,
he said something weird.

Something really strange. He said, "Its
hard to lose a loved one, isn’t it?"

Is he talkin about Tracy?
I don’t know.

Could be anything. Could be a revenge
act, it could be somebody I know.

I-I-I don’t know.
Harry Stipe. Harry Stipe.

He swore that he would get you

No, Harry Stipes doin´ five to ten.
Not anymore. He got paroled.

Harry Stipe is out?
Yeah, it just came in.

Stipe is out, and nobody told me?
Just came across my desk.

He’s not trained as a canine officer.
He’s a dog with a pet.

Ooh! Aren’t we a little moody?

Growls
Zeus and I can handle this case alone.

I got news for you. Once I get a
parolees address, this case is closed.

Then I got news for you.
A parolee doesn’t even fit the profile.

Profile? What is this,
an Olympic moment?

This is a police investigation here.
Really? I wouldn’t have guessed.

You don’t need a profile
to catch a bad guy.

All you need is a good cop
with good instincts.

I’m glad you said "good cop,"
because so far, your instincts suck!

You two are gonna
get along great.

Dooley, I need to talk to you alone.
No offense, Sergeant.

No offense
taken, Captain.

See you outside,
partner.

Hey! If you’re
gonna ride with me,

get out of that uniform and

All right. Come on, Jerry.

Uh, I got a delivery
for, uh, Detective Dooley.

Sign, please.

Uh, there’s a complementary card in there.
Thank you.

I saw the vet report
today, and uh,

you need to-

Dooley What? Jerry Lee Whines

You better give
some serious th-

You need to give thought to getting a newer dog.
What?

Well, one like Zeus. Yes.
Zeus?

That crazy, psycho dog?
Are you kiddin’ me?

He wouldn’t last five minutes
with me- I’d kill him!

Look, he probably
doesn’t even drink.

I don’t need a new dog. You know what
I need is a bigger gun- one like this.

Will you put that away, you idiot?
Or one like this.

Where did you get this? This-This is
L.A., not Dallas. - How about this one?

Look, I got a guy out there
with an M-16 takin’ shots at me,

and all I got...
is this.

Dooley, firearms, that’s not
the problem. The problem is Jerry Lee.

What?
Well, if he misses a step, you could lose your life.

Don’t you understand? That’s why
I’m giving you both new partners.

I read that vet report.

The vet report said you were in the best
shape you’ve ever been in your life.

Alert. Responsive.

He’s a killer!

You’re a stud dog,
Jerry Lee.

See?

You see that?
You see his sly and uncanny way?

He’s pretending to be

Hey, Dooley. These flowers
were just delivered for you.

Must have been

Who gave you these?
The delivery guy.

What did he look like?
Green pants, black belt.

You saw him from
the waist down, that’s it?

I was sittin’ in- - What are you
doing? Touching evidence again?

Puttin’ your prints
all over this? Listen to me.

You see these gloves? I want you to wear these things. Forever!
Yeah.

Okay.
Take these down to the lab and have them dusted.

Welles Zeus! Come!
Come on. Lets go.

That Welles and that stupid psycho dog
is probably sittin up at the desk.

You and I can go get
the bad guys ourselves.

Hey!
We were just looking for you.

Weren’t we, Jerry?
Check this out.

If you look at the holes,
they actually spell out something.

It says, "Even though
I’m older and slower,

I’m still the same asshole
as I was before. "

I can do that.

All right, look.
I want to get one thing straight...

Now, you have got
to let it go.

I don’t even think
about it anymore.

And neither should you.
Okay?

Okay.
What do you mean, okay?

I mean okay.
Okay, you agree with it,

or okay, you don’t
think about it anymore?

Okay. I don’t think about it.
How can you not think about it?

You said you don’t think about it.
Well, of course not.

I mean, Im-I´mm-I´mm-
But what? What?

What? You’re so irresistible,
how could I not think about it?

Well-
Because, you know, it was one night.

Heat of the moment stuff.
Absolutely right!

Right.
Get in.

Sighing, Swearing

What was that?
What? Nothing.

And you, dog, lets get one thing
straight between you and me, all right?

Number one: No barking,
no drooling, no f-

passing of gas...

or performing any bodily functions
in or about my car.

Number two: You always
sit in the back seat.

Number three:

Welles I’m tellin´ ya, he’s

And how would you know that?
Because he doesn’t fit the profile.

Profile. Clears Throat Welles,

this is a profile.

A profile is only good when
you’re trying to narrow down suspects.

We need a list
of suspects first.

Its not him.
Okay, then. Stay in the car.

And you too. You stay.
Jerry Lee? Lets go. Growling

We are not staying
in the car.

Don’t look at me like that.
Look at you like what?

Not you.

Ill use it.

One of us will stake out the room from across
the hall, the other will go get a warrant.

Jerry Lee and I
do not do warrants.

Or back doors.
What else don’t you do?

We don’t do flavored coffee. We don’t

We don’t do tofu. We don’t do collagen.
We don’t do colonics.

We don’t do e-mail. We don’t do head

No, don’t be sorry. It was nothing to
apologize for. You just weren’t ready.

She ever write you a letter?

You moron!

That letter she wrote you
was a rejection letter!

Rejection?

Aah!
How do you like the ending to my book, Dooley?

Do it!
Ill do it when I’m ready.

Do it!

Go ahead!
Do it!

Shut up!

I’m in control here, Dooley.

This is my story,
not yours!

Where do you want it?

Cause I’m deciding where you
should get the next bullet.

You got any preferences?

Is this real enough for you,
Dooley?

You did it! What took you so long?

I knew you could do it, buddy.

Welles, cuff him.

Jerry Lee Barking

Wait!
You cant have dogs in here.

They’re police officers,
ma´am.

They’re dogs!
Get them out of here.

The California State Health Code,
section 4578, says absolutely...

under no circumstances are dogs
allowed in the hospital.

Come on. Don’t slime me.
Your breath is so bad.

What have you been eating?

Okay. I’m okay.

Don’t do that!

Welles, I wanna thank you
for picking me up.

Are you actually showing me
some gratitude, Dooley?

Well, yeah, I’m trying.
Good boy.

I am not a dog.
Yes, you are.

Dogs get treats.
Treats?

Dinner. What do you want?
Chinese or Italian?

Oh, you pick.
Your choice.

Oh, you’re actually giving me a choice?
Yes, your choice.

Well, then I pick Chinese.
Chinese is fine.

No, that’s what you wanted me to say.
We’re going for Italian.

Well, Italian is fine.
You actually want Italian?

Yes.
Then we are going for Chinese.

Chinese is fine. I don’t care.
Yeah, sure you don’t.

Works every time,
Jerry Lee.
