>> OBSESSIONS SOMETIMES GRAB

HOLD OF A MAN.

HE MAY THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, DAYS

AND NIGHTS OF NOTHING ELSE BUT

THE MOON.

I HAVE SUCH A MOON.

DAYS AND NIGHTS, I'M HELD IN THE

GRIP OF A MEMORY.

IT CONSUMES ME.

AN IDEA FOR A STORY...

>> WHY, THIS COUNTRY IS A

SHINING CITY ON A HILL.

THE STRONG -- THE STRONG, THEY

TELL US, WILL INHERIT THE LAND.

AND I ASK YOU NOW, LADIES AND

GENTLEMEN, BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

FOR THE GOOD OF ALL OF US, FOR

THE LOVE OF THIS GREAT NATION,

FOR THE FAMILY OF AMERICA, FOR

THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE MAKE

THIS NATION REMEMBER HOW FUTURES

ARE BUILT.

THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.

PETER. PETER!

THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

>> DID YOU KNOW THAT, IN KOREA,

JILTED LOVERS COMMIT SUICIDE BY

SEALING THEMSELVES IN A ROOM

FILLED WITH LILIES?

APPARENTLY, THE PERFUME IS

TOXIC.

I WONDER HOW MANY YOU'D NEED TO

KILL EVERYONE ON THIS TRAIN.

>> HE LIKED TRAINS BECAUSE, ON

THEM, COUPLES RARELY FEEL THE

NEED TO SPEAK.

HE MIGHT NOT HAVE TO HEAR THE

REASONS WHY HER SHOW GOT

CANCELED OR DEFEND HIMSELF FOR

NOT CASTING HER IN HIS NEXT

FILM.

HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO ENDURE THE

ENDLESS QUESTIONS ABOUT HER

BROTHER'S ILLNESS.

WHAT COULD HER DOCTOR FRIEND

TELL HER THAT SHE DIDN'T

ALREADY SUSPECT?

HE MIGHT NOT HAVE TO DISCUSS HER

SON'S ARTISTIC ANARCHY OR GOSSIP

ABOUT THE CARETAKER'S DAUGHTER

AND HER MARRIAGE OF NECESSITY.

HE'D MEET ALL OF THEM, SOON

ENOUGH.

THEY WERE OFF TO HER COUNTRY

HOUSE TO CELEBRATE HER BROTHER'S

BIRTHDAY.

IT WAS MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND,

1984.

>> I FEEL LIKE MERYL IN

"SILKWOOD."

>> WHERE IS SHE?

>> OH, GOD.

BRACE YOURSELF.

NO ONE HERE.

OH, OH.

NO ONE HERE.

OH, MY GOD!

I TAGGED A BULL ON THE WAY IN.

YOU KNOW, IT SHOOTS DARTS.

>> JOHAN!

>> WHAT? SORRY.

THAT'S HOW WE MEDICATE NOW THESE

DAYS.

>> LIKE FOOT ROT, BLACKLEG,

CANCER EYE, FOOT AND MOUTH,

LUMPY JAW, WARTS, WOOD TONGUE...

IT'S WHAT'S FOR DINNER.

>> DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

>> SORRY.

>> JOHAN!

THIS IS VERY EXPENSIVE LUGGAGE.

>> PAIN IN THE NECK.

TIE OR A GOLDFISH, LIKE ANY

NORMAL PERSON?

>> I'M NOT A NORMAL PERSON.

>> YOUR MOM IS GONNA HATE IT.

>> OF COURSE SHE'S GONNA HATE

IT -- SHE'S NOT IN IT.

>> IS SHE REALLY BRINGING PETER

THIS TIME?

NO IDEA.

>> I LOVE HIS MOVIES.

>> JUST READ THE LINES.

>> I COULD GET DISCOVERED.

>> HE'S BLIND.

DID YOU KNOW THAT?

>> HE COULD PUT ME IN A MOVIE.

>> AND DEAF.

>> I COULD BE A STAR.

>> GOOD LUCK.

I GOT TO GO.

>> WHAT?

YOU WON'T COME BACK IN TIME.

>> MY DAD DOESN'T EVEN KNOW I'M

HERE.&-I GOT TO GO.

HEY!

>> UH-HUH.

>> SHUT UP, JOHAN.

>> <i>THERE IS A BEAR IN THE WOODS.</i>

<i>FOR SOME PEOPLE, THE BEAR IS</i>

<i>EASY TO SEE.</i>

<i>OTHERS DON'T SEE IT AT ALL.</i>

<i>SOME PEOPLE SAY THE BEAR IS</i>

<i>TAME.</i>

<i>OTHERS SAY IT'S VICIOUS AND</i>

<i>DANGEROUS.</i>

<i>SINCE NO ONE CAN REALLY BE SURE</i>

<i>WHO'S RIGHT, ISN'T IT SMART TO</i>

<i>BE AS STRONG AS THE BEAR...</i>

IT GOES BLAND, BUT THIS IS

PERFECT.

>> ALEX, DOES YOUR FATHER LISTEN

TO ANYONE?

>> A MAN WALKED INTO HIS HOUSE

WITH A SHEEP UNDER HIS ARM.

HE SAYS TO HIS WIFE, "I JUST

WANT YOU TO SEE THE PIG THAT

I'VE BEEN FUCKING WHILE YOU'VE

BEEN AWAY."

AND SHE SAYS, "THAT'S NOT A PIG,

DARLING -- THAT'S A SHEEP."

AND HE SAYS, "I WASN'T TALKING

TO YOU!"

>> YOU GOT IT?

SHE WASN'T A SHEEP.

>> EAGLES, BRISKET, AND SHEEP.

OH, MY.

>> WELCOME HOME, BABY.

>> NO.

>> IS MOM HERE?

>> YEAH.

>> WHERE ARE THEY?

>> FEEDING.

>> IT'S CALLED "THERMAL

CONVECTION."

EAGLES GENERALLY SOAR ON THERMAL

CONVECTION CURRENTS, WHICH MEANS

THAT WE COULD GENERALLY PREDICT

THEIR FLIGHT PATHS.

>> LOOK AT ME, FLAPPING MY

WINGS.

>> UH, BUT R-RECENTLY, THERMAL

CURRENTS HAVE BEEN EXPANDING.

IT'S -- IT'S LIKE AN OVEN, AND

WE'RE JUST -- WE'RE JUST FRYING

OURSELVES.

>> WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

>> SO PREDICTING FLIGHT PATHS

HAS BECOME NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.

HE COULD BE LOST IN

NONDIRECTIONAL WINDS.

DOCK.

NOTHING IS.

WHAT WAS IT?

>> EXCUSE ME.

>> BOREDOM.

YOU GET COOPED UP IN THE COUNTRY

LONG ENOUGH, YOU START DOING

THINGS TO MAKE LIFE INTERESTING.

I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

I GOT MARRIED AND HAD A KID.

THE SHOW IS GONNA BE READY IN

30 MINUTES.

GOBBLE GOBBLE.

OHH, MY FOOT IS ASLEEP.

>> TEA?

>> YES.

>> EXCUSE ME.

>> GIVE ME A KISS.

>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I'M SHAVING.

WE DID THIS ONCE IN OMAN.

WE HAD NO SOAP.

WE USED MASHED POTATOES.

YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

EVA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE

AT 7:30.

HE LOOKS. HE LISTENS.

I THINK HE'S TALENTED.

>> WELL, YOU'RE WRONG.

ASK ANYONE.

>> I'M RIGHT.

>> YOU'RE SICK.

>> WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT

MAKE?

>> ARM.

>> I'M SORRY.

WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN TO...

WHOOPS.

NIGHTGOWN.

>> EXCUSE ME.

>> ERIC'S MUSE.

LIVES DOWNSTREAM.

DOESN'T DO ANYTHING, BUT SHE'S

SWEET.

I HAVE TO PEE.

>> SHE'S WEARING MY NIGHTGOWN.

HE GAVE HER MY NIGHTGOWN.

>> OH, YEAH.

>> HE'S A FRAUD.

>> NO.

>> SHE'S LIKE A DEER.

I THINK I'M GOING TO ASK HER TO

MARRY ME.

SOMEONE SHOULD.

YOU CAN'T LEAVE A GOOD GRAPE ON

THE VINE TOO LONG.

>> I'VE GOT IT COVERED.

>> OH?

HELP PETER?

HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH

THAT ROD OF HIS.

YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU?

>> OF COURSE NOT.

>> I DIDN'T THINK SO.

>> SEE YOU, LOUIS.

>> BON VOYAGE.

>> YOU TAKE A MAN FROM THE CITY,

PUT HIM IN THE COUNTRY --

SUDDENLY, HE'S NOT SO ATTRACTIVE

ANYMORE.

>> YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FIRE.

>> I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

HELP HIM CATCH SOMETHING!

IT WOULD BE LOVELY IF THE DAY

WEREN'T A COMPLETE WASTE!

LITTLE TWIT.

HERB -- HOW IS HE?

I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR CENTURIES.

WE ARE INCAPABLE OF LYING TO ONE

ANOTHER.
