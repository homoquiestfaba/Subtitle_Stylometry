No, please! No! Please!

Davey!

Come running, lad!
Please don't!

Stop it!
Brand you like a damn steer!

Bitch!
No, please!

Hold the bitch! Hold her!

Hold her or I'll cut her tits off!

Go get Skinny! Quick!

Mike, don't!

Skinny!

Think it's funny?

Skinny, get the gun!

Get off of her, cowboy.

They wouldn't let you settle it?
You know Skinny.

He says he'll shoot them.

I says, "You can't."
He says, "Get Little Bill."

I says, "He's sleeping."
But he don't care.

He'll shoot them boys soon.

She dying?

She'll live.

She didn't steal nothing
or touch his poke.

When she seen his
teensy little pecker...

...she giggled.
She didn't know no better.

Hang them, Little Bill.

Go to the office and get the bullwhip.

A whipping's all they
get after what they done?

It ain't no little thing.
But what they done...

Alice!

Shut up!

Whipping won't settle this.
No?

Here's a contract between me and
Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.

I brought her from Boston,
paid her expenses and all.

I got a contract that represents
an investment of capital.

Property.

Damaged property.

Like if I hamstrung one of their ponies.

You think nobody'll fuck her now?

Hell, no!

Leastways, won't pay to do it!

Nobody's going to pay good money
for a cut-up whore!

You boys are off the Bar T.

Got your own ponies?

Yeah, I got four.

Six.

Guess you want no trial, no fuss?

No, sir.

All right.

You did the cutting.

This fall, you bring in
five ponies to Skinny.

Five?

And you...

...bring two.

You give them over, hear?
Yes, sir.

The whip.

Maybe we don't need it now.

I'll tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies...

...I'll come looking for you.
You ain't whipping them?

I fined them instead, Alice.

Skinny gets some ponies and that's it?!

That ain't fair.

That ain't fair!

Haven't you seen enough blood tonight?

Hell, Alice...

...it ain't like they was
tramps or loafers or...

...bad men. They were just...

...hardworking boys that were foolish.

If they was wicked in a regular way-
Like whores?

Tend to Delilah.

Go ahead.

I got $85.

I don't know.

If Delilah doesn't care,
what are we so riled up about?

We let them smelly fools
ride us like horses...

...doesn't mean we must let
them brand us like horses.

Maybe we ain't nothing
but whores, but...

...by God, we ain't horses!

I got $112.

That's everything.

And you, Faith?

200.

240...dollars.

Jesus, what you been doing?

Giving Skinny something special?

She laughs.

With what Kate got, and Silky,
me and Little Sue...

It ain't enough.

Not yet, maybe.

You don't look like no son-of-a-
bitching cold-blooded assassin.

Say what?

You call yourself Mr. William Munny.

You have me confused with
someone else, mister.

Shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?

Hey, Pa!

What, son?

Two more hogs got the fever.

You shot Charlie Pepper.

You killed William Harvey and
robbed that train in Missouri.

Hold on.

Son, get those hogs separated there.

Penny, help your brother.

That one's sick too.

We'll talk inside.

So you're Pete Sothow's nephew?

I thought you'd come to kill me for
something I'd done in the old days.

I could have.

Easy.

I guess maybe so.

You don't look like no meaner-than-hell,
cold-blooded damn killer.

Maybe I ain't.

Uncle Pete says you was the meanest
goddamn son-of-a-bitch alive.

And if I wanted a
partner for a killing...

...you were the worst one.

Meaning the best.

Because you're as cold as snow...

...and don't have no
weak nerve nor fear.

Pete said that?

He did.

I'm a killer myself, but I
haven't killed as many as you...

...because of my youth.

Schofield Kid, they call me.

Why?

You from Schofield?

No, it's on account of my...

...Schofield-Smith & Wesson pistol.

How about it?

How about what?

How about being my partner?

I'm heading north in
through Niobrara to Wyoming.

Kill two no-good cowboys.

For what?

For cutting up a lady.

Her face.

Cut her eyes out, her ears off.

They even cut her teets.

Jesus.

$1,000 reward, Will.

500 each.

I can't move those damn pigs!

Watch your cussing.

Do your best. Go to the
pump and get cleaned up.

Come on.

I ain't like that anymore, Kid.

It was whiskey done it as
much as anything else.

I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.

My wife...

...cured me...

...of drink and...

...wickedness.

You don't look so prosperous.

You could buy her a new
dress with your half.

You could buy your wife a fancy...

She's passed on.

Been gone near three years now.

Don't tell anyone about the reward.
I don't need no one else trying to collect.

Don't see no one.

Change your mind, you could catch me.

I'll ride due west for the
trail headed north into Wyoming.

Let's separate those hogs.

Two others.

I think they got the fever.

Took you boys a while.

A few more days and I was
going to call on the sheriff.

How about that?

The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.

I bet. Get them horses to the livery.

Take that one over around the back.

Now here's a beauty.

You got my two. This one ain't yours.

We'll see about that.

Bastards! Get out of town!

Get out of here!

You are very sick sons-of-bitches!

Don't come back, butcher!

This here pony...

...I brung for the lady my partner cut.

She's the best.

Better than what I gave him.

She can sell her...

...or do what she wants.

A pony?

She ain't got no face left
and you give her a mangy pony?

She ain't mangy!

Get out of here!

We don't need your goddamn charity!

Get out of our town and don't come back!

Get out of our town!

Did Pa use to kill folks?

I could tell your ma liked
those flowers I gave her.

She ain't a saddle horse no more, Pa.
Ain't used to the feel.

Take care of your sister, son.

Kill a few chickens if you must and
keep those hogs with fever separate.

If you have any problem, go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.

Ain't been in the saddle
myself in a while.

She's getting even with me
for the sins of my youth.

In my youth before I met
your dear departed ma...

...I was weak and given
to mistreating animals.

This horse and those hogs over there...

...are getting even for
the cruelty I inflicted.

I used to be able to cuss
and whip a horse like this...

...but your ma showed me
the error of my ways.

I'll be back in 2 weeks.

The spirit of your dear
departed ma watches over you.

Where'd you get the money?
We ain't got any!

You told them cowboys you had!
We was Iying!

Lying?

What if somebody comes to collect?

You going to hump them
a thousand times?

The people come for that thousand
won't tolerate you not having it!

They won't just cut up your face!

You stupid bitches.

Stupid bitches.

Shit!

Damn it! Jesus!

Get your finger?

Hello, Skinny.

You snuck up on me.

Like her?

I heard you done the roof yourself.

Roof?

Jesus, I did practically
the whole damn thing myself.

The Roberts boy carried wood
for me, but that's all.

What's that wood?

I'm building a porch here so I can
sit of an evening and smoke my pipe...

...and drink coffee
and watch the sunset.

Came out here just to
take a look at her?

Them whores...

...been humping all them cowboys been
through town the last two weeks.

Shit.

We got railroad barons
and cattle barons.

You'll be the first billiard baron.

They been humping and telling
every bowlegged one of them...

...they'll pay $1,000 to whoever...

...kills the two boys
that cut up Delilah.

Those cowboys are riding that
beef down to Kansas and Cheyenne?

All week long?

I didn't hear till last night myself.

The word's got all the
way to Texas by now.

Nobody will come clear from Texas.

They got all that money?

Women can lie. Ask where the
money is, they say they got none.

But the five of them could have it.

Maybe.

That much?

You could run off them two cowboys.

I could run off them whores.

They'll just up and
run anyhow, them two.

They'll stay out at the Bar T.

Close to their friends.

Shit, could be nobody won't come at all.

Got to go. I like your house.

It's Will.

Come in out of the sun.

See to Will's horse.

What you doing here?

Just thought I'd drop in on you.

We ain't bad men no more.

We're farmers.

Should be easy killing them, if
they don't go on down to Texas.

How long since you fired a gun
at a man, Will? Ten years?

Eleven.

Easy, huh?

It wasn't all that easy even back then.

And we were young and full of beans.

If you was mad at them...

...over some wrong, I
could see shooting them.

We done stuff for money before.

We thought we did.

What'd these fellows do?

Cheat at cards? Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?

They cut up a woman.

Cut her face, cut her eyes out,
cut her fingers off, cut her tits.

Everything but her cunny, I suppose.

I'll be dogged.

Guess they got it coming.

Of course, Will...

...if Claudia was alive,
you wouldn't do this.

Could you look in on my
youngsters next week?

Got some hogs to separate.

How long will you be gone?

Two weeks, I guess.

What's this Kid like?

Three ways?

I see you still have that Spencer rifle.

And I can still knock the
eye out of a bird flying.

Jesus.

He must be moving right along.

We'll come across him
tomorrow, I reckon.

Got used to my bed.
This ain't going to be like home.

That ain't the only thing I'll miss.

Hell, I'm sorry.

Don't fret it. It ain't nothing.

She don't like it much...

...you riding off with me.

Gave me the evil eye.

You know, Sally's Indian and...

...Indians ain't over-friendly.

I don't blame her.

I won't hold it against her.

She knew me back then.

She knew what a...

...no-good son-of-a-bitch I was.

She ain't allowing that I changed.

She don't realize I
ain't like that no more.

You know women.
I ain't the same, Ned.

Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

Going on this killing...

...don't mean I'll go
back to the way I was.

Just need the money.

Get a new start for them youngsters.

Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth...

...and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

I think about him now and again.

He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

You was one crazy son-of-a-bitch.

No one liked me.

The boys all thought I'd shoot
them out of pure meanness.

You ain't like that no more.

Eagle, he hated my guts.

Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

Quincy neither, I reckon.

Quincy used to just watch all the time.

Scared.

Like I said...

...you ain't like that no more.

That's right.

I'm just a fellow now.

I ain't no different than anyone else.

No more.

What son-of-a-bitch shot him?

Was it one of them John Bulls?

No, sir.

The would-be assassin is a gentleman
of French ancestry. Or so it seems.

I don't wish to give offense, but...

...the French are known to
be a race of assassins...

...who can't shoot worth a damn.

Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

Says here a fellow by
the name of Guiteau.

Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

Again, I don't wish to give offense...

...when I suggest that
this country select...

...a king or even a queen,
rather than a President.

One isn't that quick to
shoot a king or a queen.

The majesty of royalty, you see.

Maybe you don't wish to
give offense, sir...

...but you are giving it pretty thick.

This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

When I heard about queens-
Shut up, Joe.

What's wrong with you? This dude...

Might be this dude here is English Bob.

Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

Might be waiting for some cowboy...

...to touch his pistol
so he can shoot him.

Is that a fact, mister?

You English Bob?

Pheasants.

Let's shoot some pheasants.

Ten shots.

And let's say $1 a pheasant.

I'll shoot for the Queen, and you for...

...whomever.

That's 8 for me and 1 for you.

That comes to 7 American dollars.

Pretty damn good shooting...

...for a John Bull.

No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief...

...over the injury to your President.

It's the climate that does it.
That, and the infernal distances.

Does what?

Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

It's a savage country, really.

That's the second one
they shot in 20 years.

It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

Thank you.

Pardon me, gentlemen.

The law obliges you to
surrender all sidearms...

...to the proper authorities
during your visit.

Proper authority?

I can assure you...

...that neither my companion or
I carry firearms on our person.

We rely upon the goodwill of
our fellow man and the...

...forbearance of reptiles.

Unarmed, my ass.

Christ, it's hot.

If I'm going to get shot, I'd
rather it was hot than cold.

Everything hurts me more when it's cold.

If you hit your thumb-
Shut up, Fatty!

I only said-
Clyde's back.

With Little Bill?
No.

Shit.

You clean my Remington?
Cleaned and loaded.

Where's Little Bill, for chrissake?

Building his damn porch.

Building his porch?

If you got shot, would you want
it to be a hot or cold day?

I ain't going to get shot.

He's coming?

Of course he's coming.

I just loaded that.

I don't trust nobody to load
my guns for a shooting.

What he say?

Little Bill said he
was building his porch.

You seen that thing?

It was all loaded.

You got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

Or the whole house, for that matter!

He is the worst damn carpenter.

He didn't say nothing?

Asked what they looked like.

Maybe he's tough but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

Maybe he ain't so tough.

Seem like he was scared?

Little Bill? Him scared?

We never seen him up
against any like these ones.

Killers.

Little Bill come out of
Kansas and Texas, boys.

He worked them tough towns.

Just wondered.

Anybody could be scared.

He wasn't scared, boys.

He just ain't no carpenter.

There's a dignity in royalty which
precludes the likelihood of assassination.

If you pointed a pistol at a queen...

...your hands would shake as if palsied.

I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

Always a wise policy.

But if you did, I can assure you...

...the sight of royalty would cause you
to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed.

You would stand, how should I put it...

...in awe.

Now, a President...

Well, why not shoot the President?

Keep the change.

This Strawberry Alice
person, tell me again.

Down the street to Greely's Beer
Garden and Billiards Parlor.

Say you want a game of billiards.

Billiards?

Even though I don't wish to play?

No matter. They burned the
table in '78 for firewood.

Right.

Quite right.

Mr. Beauchamp, I think a cup of tea...

Hello, Bob.

Boys, this here is English Bob.

Shit and fried eggs.

Been a long time.

Run out of Chinamen?

I thought that you were dead.

You've shaved your chin whiskers off.

I was tasting the soup
two hours after I ate it.

Actually, what I heard was you...

...fell off your horse.
Drunk, of course.

And that you broke your bloody neck.

I heard that one myself, Bob.

Hell, I even thought I was dead.

Till I found out I was just in Nebraska.

Who's he?

W.W. Beauchamp.

This is Little Bill Daggett.

And friends, of course.

From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?

In person.

You work for the railroads too?

I write.

Letters?

Books, Bill. Books.

Actually...

...he's my biographer.

I wouldn't do that if I were you.

It's only a book.

A book?

That means you boys can read.

That means you saw the signs...

...saying surrender your firearms.

But like you told young Andy...

...you're not armed, are you?

Not really, Bill.

Got a Peacemaker, but that
wouldn't worry you, would it?

If you don't see it.
Or better, if you don't hear it.

I'm afraid so, Bob.

I don't like firearms around.

Be very careful with it, sonny.

See what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing.

Make sure you don't get wet.

No shit.

All he's got is writing
stuff and this book.

"The Duck of Death?"

Duke.

"The Duke."

Good afternoon, gentlemen.

I'll have that.32, Bob.

Now, Little Bill.

You will leave me at
the mercy of my enemies.

Enemies?

You been talking about the Queen again?

On Independence Day?

I guess you think I'm kicking you.

But it ain't so!

What I'm doing is talking!

Hear?!

Talking to all them villains in Kansas!

To all those villains in Missouri!

And those villains...

...down in Cheyenne!

I'm saying there ain't no whore's gold!

Even if there was, they
don't want to come for it...

...anyhow!

What are you looking at?!

Go on!

Mind your own business!

Ever go into town?

On occasion.

To sell a hog, pick up supplies.

I mean, get yourself a woman.

No, I never go into town for that.

A man like me?

Only woman I could get is
one I'd have to pay for.

That ain't right, buying flesh.

Claudia, rest her soul,
wouldn't want me doing that.

Me being a father, and all.

You just use your hand?

I don't miss it all that much.

Goddamn, somebody's shooting at us!

You hit?

I bumped my head falling off my horse.

Ain't shooting at us no more.

Shooting way over yonder.

What the hell's he shooting at?

Beats the hell out of me.

Reckon we in somebody's field?

I didn't see nothing planted.

Shooting at us again.

He's shooting at the whole horizon.

Wait! You'll mark us!

Hey, Kid!

That's the Kid shooting at us?

Kid, it's me! Will Munny!

What the hell's he shooting at us for?

That you?

Yeah, it's me!

Don't go shooting at us
no more! You hear me?

Who the hell you got with you, Will?

It's Ned Logan, my old partner!

Don't go shooting at us, you hear?

We'll get our horses
and come on over there.

You ain't going to shoot, are you?

I ain't!

Chased that horse a damn mile.

What was you shooting at us for?
I thought you was following me.

We was. You said if I changed my mind...

Wasn't nothing said about no partner.

This here's Ned Logan.

He's the Schofield Kid,
nephew to Pete Sothow.

I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is you come to kill me.

We never talked about no other fellow.

There's two cowboys. Better there's
three of us, if they got friends.

I can take care of them two myself.
It don't take three.

Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.

Better than you, anyhow.

You wasn't even coming close.
Hands off!

Thought I'd check it for you.
Maybe something's bent.

It ain't...bent.

You were shooting all over creation!

You'll share your half with him?

I figure three ways.

Wrong.

Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.

You going back with him?

He's my partner.

He don't go, I don't.

What's it come to, three ways?

Shit!

What are you pissing on about?

What are you looking at?

Looking at?

Clouds.

He's looking at them clouds on
account of we got a storm coming.

I seen them.

You was smart to change your mind.

I'm a real good shot with this rifle.

See that hawk?

I could hit it with one shot.

Hell, I could hit it too.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.

There ain't no hawk, Kid.

You can't see for shit, can you?

See your canteen?

How far can you see?

Far enough.

We ain't going to shoot canteens!
How far? 100 yards?

More.

See that scrub oak tree yonder?
Fuck you.

He's blind, Will!
I ain't blind, you asshole!

Hold it!

How far can you see, Kid? 50 yards?

You bet your ass I can
see 50 yards, Will.

I can see well enough to
shoot this son-of-a-bitch.

Hold on.

Hear that, Ned?

Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.

Jesus.

Fifty yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.

They look like real hard cases, Bob.

Did you kill all 7 of them?

Or just wing some of them?

That you here embalmed on the cover?

"The Duck of Death?"

The Duke.

"The Duke of Death."

You always were good with a
pistol, but 7 of them? Boy!

Protecting that woman.
How the hell do you do that?

It's desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain...

...liberty when depicting
the cover scene.

For reasons involving the marketplace.

From what I read, the writing's not
that much different than the picture.

I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...

...that the events described are
taken from eyewitness accounts.

Eyewitnesses?
Yes, sir.

Like the Duck himself, I guess.

The Duke.

Duck, I says.

"'You have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman, Corcoran'...

...said the Duck.

'You must apologize.'

But Two-Gun Corcoran
would none of it.

Cursing, he reached for his
pistols and would have killed him...

...but the Duck was faster and hot
lead blazed from his smoking six-guns."

I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

There is a certain poetry to the
language which I couldn't resist.

I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita...

...the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

I didn't see you there...

...nor no woman...

...nor two-gun shooters.

Nor none of this.

You were there?
Yeah, I was there.

First off...

...Corky never carried two
guns, though he should have.

He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun.

But not because he had two pistols.

He had a dick that was so big...

...it was longer than the
barrel on his Walker Colt.

The only insulting he did
was stick that thing...

...into a French lady
English Bob was sweet on.

The night Corky walked
into the Blue Bottle...

...before he knows what's what,
Bob takes a shot at him!

And misses, he's so damn drunk.

That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky, and he did the wrong thing.

In his hurry, he shot his damn toe off.

Meantime, Bob here...

...aims real good and
squeezes off another...

...but he misses, he's still so drunk!

He hits this thousand-dollar
mirror over the bar.

The Duck of Death is as good as dead...

...because Corky does it right.

He aims real careful.

No hurry...

The Walker Colt blew up in his hand...

...a failing common to that model.

If Corky'd had two guns
instead of just a big dick...

...he'd have defended
himself to the end.

Wait a minute.

English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have...

Bob wasn't going to wait for
Corky to grow a new hand.

No, he just walked over
there real slow...

...'cause he's drunk...

...and shot him through the liver.

I don't like rocks on my dad-gum back.

I sure do miss my bed.
You said that last night.

Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dad-gum bed!

You'll miss your dad-gum
roof next, I suppose.

Will?

That business up in Jackson County...

...that really happen?

The way they say it happened?

What business?

Two deputies up close pointing
their rifles right at you.

Got you dead to rights.

You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

Only took a scratch yourself.

Uncle Pete never seen nothing like you
shooting your way out of that scrape.

Well, I don't recollect.

You don't recollect?

Right.

Ned...

...how many men you killed?

Ain't you going to answer?

What the hell's that to you?

I got to know what kind of fellow I'm
riding with, case we get into a scrape.

How many men you killed, Kid?

Five.

How many?

Five.

I done killed 5 of them.

That's including a Mexican
who come at me with a knife.

Why don't you shut up? Get some rest.

You boys're as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.

Actually...

...Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck...

Than English Bob?

Faster?

Faster was his mistake.

If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't
have shot himself in the toe.

He would've killed old Bob.

Being a good shot and being
quick with a pistol...

...don't do no harm, but it don't
mean much next to being cool-headed.

A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire...

...like as not will kill you.

But if the other fellow is quicker...

Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.

Look.

That's as fast as I can draw, aim and
hit anything more than 10 feet away.

'Less it's a barn.

But if he doesn't miss?

He'll kill you.

That's why there's so few
dangerous men around like Bob.

Like me.

It ain't so easy to shoot a
man if he's shooting back.

That'll flat rattle some folks.

I'll show you something.
Wait.

Look.

Take that.

Take it.

There's the key.

Just shoot me...

...and you and Bob can ride
on out of here free as birds.
