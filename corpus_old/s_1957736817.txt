<i>Okay, this is quarantine,</i>
<i>day 83. Wow.</i>

<i>We in this bitch.</i>

<i>Positivity. What's new?</i>

<i>Um...</i>
<i>My lash kit came in. He-he.</i>

<i>Not sure, uh, why I got it.</i>
<i>I have no one to wear it for.</i>

<i>I haven't left my apartment.</i>

<i>Um, you gotta, like, take</i>
<i>these little lashes out.</i>

<i>Can you even see that?</i>

<i>You know what they call</i>
<i>the little rubber bits</i>

<i>that go on</i>
<i>the little tweezers?</i>

<i>Wandoms.</i>

<i>Swipin'</i>
<i>an awful lot, let's say,</i>

<i>on the various dating apps.</i>

<i>I have been talking</i>
<i>to Reed an awful lot.</i>

<i>I feel like I like him more</i>
<i>every time we talk, kind of.</i>

<i>I love someone who I can...</i>
<i>give shit to,</i>

<i>and they can</i>
<i>give shit back to me.</i>

<i>Like, if I give</i>
<i>you shit and you're like,</i>

<i>"Aw, come on."</i>
<i>It's like, grow up.</i>

<i>Do you know what I mean?</i>
<i>I really miss Sara.</i>

<i>I like-- This is</i>
<i>the longest we've been apart</i>

<i>form each other,</i>
<i>like, since college.</i>

<i>What about the holidays? Fuck.</i>

<i>That's, like, such a big deal</i>

<i>for Sara and I,</i>
<i>like, Halloween.</i>

<i>I was gonna be Lil' Kim</i>
<i>at the '99 VMAs this year.</i>

<i>What if I don't get</i>
<i>to take my titty out?</i>

<i>At a party? That's a shame.</i>

<i>I gotta get off--</i>
<i>Who am I even making this for?</i>

<i>Um, signing off.</i>

<i>See you later,</i>
<i>future me, I guess.</i>

[phone ringing]

<i>Hello...</i>

Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

<i>Hi!</i>

<i>Oh, my God! Hey!</i>

Uh, wait, uh,
best friend says what?

<i>What!</i>

<i>Dab.</i>

<i>How are you? Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I haven't seen your face</i>

<i>-in so long.</i>
-I'm good.

I miss you, how are you?

<i>I miss you so much. You look</i>
<i>so good. You look so pretty.</i>

You're so sweet. Stop it.
Okay.

Full disclosure, I did think
you were going to be Reed

'cause he was
supposed to be FaceTiming me.

<i>Oh, so sorry</i>
<i>to disappoint you.</i>

I think I'll get over it.
I'll get over it.

[both laughing]

How's-- What's new?
What's going on?

<i>Um... Nothing much.</i>
<i>I mean, it's hot.</i>

Yeah--

<i>And it's my parents' house.</i>

<i>And I'm totally reverting</i>

<i>to who I was when I was 17.</i>

<i>It's horrible.</i>

Were you cool when you were 17?

<i>No. I... was depressed</i>
<i>and I listened to,</i>

<i>like, I dunno, like, punk.</i>

<i>And I didn't even listen</i>
<i>to punk 'cause I liked it,</i>

<i>I listened to</i>
<i>it because I thought</i>

<i>that's what</i>
<i>someone hot would do.</i>

-To me, that's cool.
-[Sara] <i>Thank you--</i>

I listened to punk in
high school because I, like,

liked it.

And thi-- I think
that makes me hot,

so I, like,
really appreciate that.

<i>It is hot</i>
<i>and I'm jealous that</i>

<i>that was</i>
<i>your experience with punk.</i>

-[laughs]
<i>-Anyway, okay.</i>

<i>So-- so, what</i>
<i>else is going on?</i>

<i>How's New York?</i>

Um, it's bleak.

<i>Weather-wise?</i>


-- although the AC
still isn't fixed.

I just meant, like, COVID-wise.

Like, nobody's here.

And all the brownstones
on our block,

like, all the rich
people that live here are,

like, totally gone to their,

<i>-Really?</i>
-like, summer homes, I guess?

<i>Like me.</i>

Wait, are you staying
there for the summer?

<i>Um, I think</i>
<i>I might come back, like,</i>

<i>in the next few weeks.</i>

<i>I don't really know...</i>
<i>Is that okay?</i>

Yeah. That sounds amazing.

<i>Okay, cool. Okay, good.</i>

We should do
something when you get back.

<i>Yeah, okay, so, I want</i>
<i>to have a little dinner</i>

<i>where we do a celebration</i>
<i>about our friendship.</i>

<i>Like a welcome ba-- but it's</i>
<i>also about me a little bit.</i>

-[chuckles]
-That tracks--

<i>It's like, "Welcome back,</i>
<i>Sara. Also, we're friends."</i>

Okay, wait. Can I tell
you a secret, speaking of?

<i>Okay, please.</i>

Um, okay,

-so, I was talking to Reed--
-[Sara] <i>Yeah.</i>

-- and we were talking

about potentially
hanging out in person.

Like going on a date.

<i>Really?</i>

Yeah.

<i>Like, during the pan-- But--</i>

<i>Okay, but what about,</i>
<i>like, social distance stuff?</i>

We'll, like-- We'll do
it as safely as possible.

Obviously, like,
we'll go sit at a park

or, like, I dunno, go for a--
go for a walk.

-There's things to do.
<i>-Really? I don't know.</i>

<i>I feel like everything</i>
<i>I've heard, it's like,</i>

<i>"Stay indoors</i>
<i>and, like, don't see</i>

<i>people you don't know."</i>

Yeah, but I kind of know him.

We've been talking for, like,

the better part of four months.

<i>Yeah. I guess. You, like,</i>
<i>know each other, like, online.</i>

Yeah.

<i>wear a mask, I guess. I--</i>

<i>I dunno. If you do, though,</i>
<i>like, don't tell anyone.</i>

<i>That's kind of,</i>
<i>like, not okay.</i>

Yeah. Yeah, things are
pretty open down there, huh?

<i>-Yeah. It's pretty crazy.</i>
-[Naomi] You--

<i>Like, I went to</i>
<i>the beach the other day</i>

<i>and, like, maybe two</i>
<i>people were in a mask?</i>

Yeah, I saw-- I think
it was a couple weeks ago

you posted, um, on
your Instagram, like, a video

and a couple pictures of you
and your hometown friends,

um, at that bar?

<i>Yeah. Yeah, but--</i>

<i>Okay, that was, like,</i>
<i>three people and it was, like,</i>

<i>all these people that</i>
<i>I've known since I was,</i>

<i>like, a kid, basically.</i>

<i>So, it wasn't,</i>
<i>like, strangers.</i>

No, no, no. I'm just bringing--

I just was jealous.
It looked really fun.

<i>No, it was so fun.</i>

<i>I mean, I was almost</i>
<i>blackout at that point,</i>

<i>so I literally don't remember,</i>
<i>but it was really fun.</i>

Um, have you been
reading about the protests?

<i>Yeah, I mean, not-- not,</i>
<i>like, reading, but I've seen,</i>

<i>like, clips and stuff</i>
<i>and it looks so scary.</i>

It's-- I dunno. I went
to one a few weeks back and--

<i>Oh, really? Oh, my God.</i>

Yeah, yeah.

<i>It's kind of crazy, right?</i>
It was a little--

The vibe wasn't crazy.

Like, no one's doing anything
violent, you know what I--

-Like, the ones who are--
<i>-I mean...</i>

-What?
<i>-I don't know.</i>

<i>I'm obviously not there</i>

<i>so I don't, like, have</i>
<i>all the information.</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I feel like the part of it</i>

<i>that's protesting</i>
<i>is really cool.</i>

-[Naomi] Yeah.
<i>-And then part of it that's</i>

<i>destroying stuff...</i>

<i>Like, do you</i>
<i>have to destroy Target</i>

<i>to make a point?</i>

<i>Because I feel like there's</i>

<i>peaceful protesting,</i>

<i>and then</i>
<i>there's, like, rioting.</i>

<i>And like, MLK was--</i>

<i>di-- He did, like,</i>
<i>peaceful protesting.</i>

And he got shot in
the face anyway. So...

I mean, I know that.

Yeah, I-- Yeah.

<i>It's complicated. It's</i>
<i>like, when people are like,</i>

<i>"The cops are being violent."</i>

<i>I'm like, well,</i>
<i>probably not every cop</i>

<i>is being violent.</i>

I mean, not every protester
is being violent either.

Ooh. My hair. Look at this.

<i>It looks good.</i>

-[Naomi] Thank you.
<i>-Look at my hair.</i>

-It looks really good.
-[Sara] <i>Frizzy.</i>

-It looks like--
<i>-It's frizzy from the air.</i>

It must be humid
down there right now.

<i>Yeah, it's so hot.</i>

Um. Yeah. I don't know.
I guess I just, um...

-Protesting gets stuff done--
<i>-I--</i>

-- and sometimes
you gotta be a little violent

to get stuff done, that's all.

That's just what I think.

<i>Totally.</i>

Yeah.

Um, but this dinner
when you get back. Hello?

<i>I'll bring wine from Florida.</i>

Florida wine, what's that like?

<i>You'll hate it.</i>

What's that like?
Is there, like--

<i>So sweet.</i>

It's, like, really
sweet and kind of, like, gross?

<i>Well, I'm just thinking</i>
<i>of the one my mom has.</i>

<i>My mom's wine sucks.</i>

You want to bring me bottles
of your mom's shitty wine?

<i>Well, I just want to</i>
<i>bring bottles of her wine</i>

<i>so that she is confused</i>
<i>as to where they went.</i>

-[Naomi] Sure.
<i>-Because I'm annoyed at her</i>

<i>-right now.</i>
-Wait. Okay, so just to be

clear: you want to feed me
your mom's shitty wine,

um, to inconvenience your mom?

<i>Yeah. It's a perfect</i>
<i>situation where no one wins.</i>

Yeah, I-- Actually,
I really love that.

I actually--
I love being used as a pawn,

um, in that particular way.

So, I want to say
thank you in advance.

-And I can't wait to try this--
<i>-Of course--</i>

-- this, uh, swamp swill is
what I'm gonna call it.

Is that offensive?

<i>No, I-- I don't really know.</i>

<i>I don't really</i>
<i>know what's offensive.</i>

<i>I feel like every day</i>
<i>I learn about something,</i>

<i>like, that's offensive that</i>
<i>I didn't know is offensive.</i>

Yeah. I feel like
sometimes you say something

that's offensive and I'm like,

"I can't
believe Sara said that."

<i>Wait, really?</i>

but, like, not in like a--

<i>You have to tell me.</i>
<i>So embarrassing.</i>

I tell you all the time.
I tell you all the time.

-Yeah.
<i>-No way, dude.</i>

once or twice a month

-you say something that I'm--
-[phone beeping]

Oh, shit.
Ooh! This is Reed. I gotta go.

<i>Oh, okay, okay,</i>
<i>love you, love you.</i>

-Bye, love you.
<i>-Talk later. Bye.</i>

-[beeping]
-Hey!

<i>-Yo!</i>
-[Naomi] How's it goin?

<i>Chillin', chillin'.</i>
<i>What about you?</i>

I'm doing a lot of the same.

Uh... What's new?

<i>You know, I gotta ask.</i>
<i>Every time we chat,</i>

<i>you know I gotta ask.</i>

<i>How's, uh, Mariska</i>
<i>and how's, uh, Elliot?</i>

<i>-I don't know these names--</i>
-[Naomi] Dude. Dude.

Okay. So, first of all,
I'm on a season that Elliot

is no longer on, so,
like, take it--

Take that down,
write that down. Um...

<i>-Okay. Let me find a pen.</i>
-[Naomi laughs]

But Mariska's good.
She's good.

She's kicking ass,
she's taking names.

Do you know who the character--
the person she's based on

is the woman who prosecuted,
uh, the Central Park Five?

<i>Did you know I didn't know</i>

<i>she was based</i>
<i>on anybody at all?</i>

I think
they were more just like,

"Oh, yeah, she's like a,
you know,

strong girlboss feminist.
La la la--"

Which she is in the show,
in many ways.

Um, except in the earlier
seasons where she's pretty

transphobic,
if we're being honest.

But that's not her fault.
She's a fictional character.

It is the writers' fault.
And that's why they need to

diversify writers' rooms, bro.

<i>Okay. And there you go.</i>
<i>You popped off once again.</i>

[Naomi laughs]

I feel like every time
you make fun of me popping off,

Um, I dunno, an angel gets
its wings. I don't know.

I don't know where
I was going with that. Anyway,

<i>-Sure.</i>
-how's frickin'--

-What are you watching again?
<i>Let me tell you.</i>

<i>I was just, uh, FaceTiming</i>
<i>with my buddy, Brandon.</i>

<i>Um, and he was saying</i>
<i>how</i> Saving Silverman

<i>isn't that funny of a movie.</i>

<i>And then we got in this</i>
<i>huge discussion about how he</i>

<i>thinks Steve Zahn is not</i>
<i>a good actor/comedic actor.</i>

What?

<i>It's frickin' Steve Zahn.</i>

<i>He was in</i> Reality Bites.
You've Got Mail.

<i>And of course,</i>
Saving Silverman.

<i>-And that has the guy--</i>
-I--

<i>who fucked the pie in it.</i>

Okay. I actually
do know about that scene

in that particular movie.
But I do want to remind you

that, um, as much as I love
talking to you about films,

I've seen exactly one
film in my entire life.

And I don't even know
if you can call it a film.

It's more of a movie, really.

Um, and it is
the Kenan Thompson vehicle,

uh, 1996's <i>Heavyweights,</i> uh,
about the weight loss scam.

<i>Anytime I bring up</i>
<i>any movie, you either go,</i>

<i>"This is a-- Reminds</i>
<i>me of an episode of</i> SVU,"

<i>or you say, "You know,</i>
<i>this guy actually reminds me</i>

<i>a little bit of Kenan Thompson</i>
<i>in</i> Heavyweights."

I don't know what to tell you.
I've seen one movie.

You-- I can talk about TV
until the cows come home,

especially in a pandemic.

I've been watching-- You know,
there's-- It's kind of all

I do, is, like, cook food
and watch television shows

that I've already seen.

Do you know that they say
that people who watch

the same show, like-- like,
episodes they already seen,

they're doing
it because it, like,

provides a sense
of, like, comfort?

<i>Okay. Because I've</i>
<i>been rewatching</i> Survivor,

<i>and I'm just, like,</i>
<i>over and over watching--</i>

<i>And you know what's fucked up?</i>

<i>Is I know</i>
<i>who wins every season.</i>

<i>And I still watch</i>
<i>it and I'm always like,</i>

<i>"I'm rooting for other</i>
<i>people that are--</i>

<i>that I know</i>
<i>are not gonna win."</i>


I'm always rooting
for, uh, the Black person.

And then once the Black
person gets eliminated,

like, the next Blackest
person.

You know, like,
if there's someone

who even looks
like they could have

like, someone Black
in their past, like--

<i>So, if you got eliminated,</i>
<i>you'd be rooting for me next?</i>

Yes.

<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

-[Naomi] Yes.
<i>-On the scale,</i>

<i>I'm over here.</i>
<i>You're over here.</i>


Um... Wait, are you Black?

<i>-No. No--</i>
-[Naomi] Oh, okay. Okay--

-I just didn't know--
<i>-I'm just saying I'm not</i>

<i>white. Just saying I'm not</i>
<i>white. I'm just not white.</i>

Okay. That is-- That is clear.
I will say that is clear

and I appreciate that a lot
about you.

[both laughing]

Um... Oh, my God.

Can I tell you something
crazy I did this morning?

<i>Tell me the craziest thing</i>
<i>you did ever this morning.</i>

Dude. Are you ready for this?

<i>-Go off.</i>
-I was walking down the street.

I was coming back
from the grocery store.

And someone had put,
like, a box of records

outside their house.

And I was like, "Oh,
my God, should I do this?

Like, should I do this?

Like, is this okay
to do in a pandemic?"

And... I did it.
And I found one.

And it is not a first pressing,

so don't get excited, but
it is <i>Wowee Zowee</i> by Pavement.

-What? Can you believe--
<i>-Whoa! Holy flip flops.</i>

Did you say, "Holy flip flops"?

<i>I'm having fun with it.</i>

Why do I keep
talking to you? Oh, my God.

<i>fucked up. It's endearing.</i>

Yeah. That's part
of your charm. And the hair.

Which way are we parting it?

Which way are
we parting it today?

<i>Today it's this way.</i>

<i>We got a little bit of volume.</i>

<i>But you know what?</i>

<i>Uh, how about, uh, you see</i>

<i>in person how,</i>
<i>uh-- how I part it?</i>

Are we, like, gonna do it?

Feel like we've been talking
about it for a long time.

<i>I mean, you're safer than</i>
<i>anybody I know at this point.</i>

That's a really
nice thing to say.

That's a really,
really nice thing to say.

<i>You know I'm a nice guy.</i>

[both laugh]

Wait. So, okay, are we gonna--

What are we gonna do?
Are we gonna do this? Like--

<i>Yeah, uh, let's think.</i>
<i>Well, we could...</i>

<i>We can get sushi,</i>
<i>take it to the park.</i>

Sit six feet apart?

<i>Yeah. You know what?</i>
<i>We'll sit eight feet apart.</i>

<i>We'll be extra safe.</i>

Whoa. Okay. I actually
really like a guy who,

like, takes my safety
into extra consideration.

-Like, that's great.
<i>-You know what? Safety's sexy.</i>

<i>That's the number one catch</i>
<i>phrase in America right now.</i>

It actually is really hot.
Oh, wait, can I show you?

I've been ordering, like,
a bunch of stupid shit

off the Internet. And I got
the coolest new dress.

-Can I show you?
<i>-Please show me.</i>

Oh, my God. One second.
I'll be right back.


hold it up, so get--

-Are you ready?
<i>-I'm excited beyond belief.</i>

-[gasping] <i>Whoa!</i>
-[Naomi] Isn't that so cool?

<i>I'm going to get boned</i>
<i>out just looking at that.</i>


<i>-That's so cool.</i>
-I mean, the honkers are

a little-- The honkers are
a little bigger than mine,

but a girl can dream, you know?

<i>Hey, you know what?</i>

<i>If you don't have dreams,</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

I agree. I agree.
Especially at a time like this.

<i>Here's an idea.</i>
<i>You wear that on the date.</i>

Oh, my God. People are
gonna think I'm a slut.

<i>Fuck 'em.</i>

Okay, that was a test
and you passed.

Be a slut, do whatever
you want. That's my motto.

Um, I have to do, like,
a happy hour with my cousin.

<i>For sure.</i>

Um, but let's chat tomorrow?

<i>I'm down. Cool.</i>

Word. All right. Uh, talk
to you soon, Reed. Byeee!

<i>See you, Naomi.</i>

[line dropped sound]

[Naomi humming softly]

Hello, cuz...

<i>Hi, darling.</i>
<i>Ah, you look excellent!</i>

I got all zhuzhed up for you.

<i>Stop it.</i>
<i>No, that cleavage. That's--</i>

Mm. Mwah--

Oh, this here?

<i>Excellente.</i>
<i>Give it to them.</i>

<i>Come on. Mm-hmm.</i>

Thank you. I've been
eating a lot of cheese.

Do you like this lip?

<i>Sorry. Cheese?</i>

Cheese makes
your boobs bigger. It's milk.

Anyways. Catch me up.
What's going-- What's new?

<i>Um, I met this</i>
<i>cute, cute woman.</i>

<i>Like, I'm not</i>
<i>trying to jinx it, okay.</i>

<i>I'm not trying to jinx it.</i>

<i>But I think she</i>
<i>could be the one...</i>

Another of the one.

<i>What's your problem?</i>

<i>No, actually, let's talk</i>
<i>about it. What's your problem?</i>

No, I-- that wasn't a hate.

You think every single person
that you meet is the one.

But I actually--
You have such excellent taste

in partners, I see why you
could feel that every single

person that you ever
even mentioned

going on a date with
could be the one.

And it's because
you have excellent taste.

That wasn't a dig. It was
more of an acknowledgment.

<i>That was such...</i>

<i>a roundabout way</i>
<i>to just chat utter shit.</i>

<i>Did you hear the words</i>
<i>as they left your mouth?</i>

<i>Did they make sense</i>
<i>to you as they were leaving?</i>

I haven't seen a person in real
life in, like, four months?

Except for,
you know, at the grocery store

and obviously the liquor store.

<i>Yeah. I mean,</i>
<i>obviously, these all--</i>

<i>These are all Zoom dates.</i>

<i>So, I've been going</i>
<i>on, like, loads of, like,</i>

<i>blind Zoom dates.</i>

I was really jealous. I thought
you were dating in person.

Um, but I'm
glad that we're all--

We're both in the same boat.

Suffering.

Um, but I haven't been on

a date yet, per se.

But I have been
talking to somebody new.

We met on a dating app,
and he's really handsome.

He has really good taste
in music, which I feel

like is pretty rare,
because mine is specific.

But also he's just,
I don't know.

He's really kind and
funny and we've been talking--

Like, ever since
I met him we've been talking,

like, pretty much every day.

<i>-Oh, my God. What's his name?</i>
-Yeah.

His name is Reed.

<i>Hmph. Okay. Is he white?</i>

<i>Why can't you just settle</i>
<i>down with a nice</i>

-Sadie. Sadie.
<i>-Black guy? You know?</i>

I went to school
in Amherst, Massachusetts.

I don't know what
you guys expect for me.

Every single time I talk to
anyone of you, "Is he white?"

And is he most of the time?
Sure. But it's also like,

I had my sexual awakening
in a very white place.

I just assume
that kind of anyone--

Mm, I was going to say
something--

Ooh, you were
gonna make fun of me.

<i>What were you gonna say?</i>

I assume that dudes
who look like they could

be mixed <i>are</i> mixed.

Like, I don't give
them the benefit of the doubt,

until proven otherwise.

<i>Wow. Massachusetts</i>
<i>really fucked you up, huh?</i>

[Naomi laughing]

That's actually not fair,
'cause now that I say that

out loud, like, people assume
that because I'm light-skinned,

that I have a white parent.

And it's like,
"No, I'm just Cape Verdean.

Those are my rapist ancestors."



Anyway... Um, so Sara's
still out of town.

She is not
really taking

the same considerations
that I am.

She just does
things that I'm just like,

"Why are
you doing these things?"

You know, like,
why are you making the choices

that you're making?

Especially during
a pand-- I don't-- What?

Okay, so we're
doing the neck roll now?

<i>Listen, I just--</i>
<i>I have aches--</i>

You're so fucking irritating.

[doorbell buzzing]

Shit. Give me one second.
Doorbell just rang.



Oh, hey. How's it going?
What's up?

Oh, you know, same old.

Just, uh-- just making
my rounds.

delivering today?

Oh, you know, just, uh...

It looks like some groceries.

A few of these discreet ones,

you know what I'm sayin'?

Discreet ones?

a bunch of dildos.

when you're delivering a dildo?

Nothing else shakes.

actually an excellent point.

Anyway, nice to see you.
I know you busy.

You have a good rest
of your day. Take care.

Oh, shoot. Hey!
Hey, hi, um, hi, sorry.

Hey! Hey! How's it going?

Hey. Hey.

Um, how's the--
how's the baby?

She's growing like a weed.

Eight-three-quarters weeks.

Eight and three quarters
weeks. Wow. Parenthood, huh?

How-- How are you?
They never ask about the dad.

How are you doing?
You gettin' any sleep?

[chuckles awkwardly]
Yeah.

This is so weird.

And I'm going to preface
it by just saying

that off the bat.
I apologize in advance.

But can I ask you a question?

I just need a man's
perspective on something,

and I have no one.

Yeah.

So, basically I've
been talking to this guy

-on a dating app--
-[neighbor] Uh-huh--

For, like, the duration
of quarantine, right?

And he's really great.
And it's been months

and this is,
like, the longest time

that I've ever talked
to someone who I intend

to go on a date with,
without actually going

-on a date with them--
-[neighbor] Uh-huh.

And so we have
decided that we want to meet up

in person, right?
Socially distanced, of course.

Very safe, like,
six feet apart,

maybe at a park
somewhere outside.

Like, the whole shebang.

But I know my roommate,
who is not here yet,

but who is gonna
be back sometime soon,

I imagine,
is going to be really,

really pissed about that.

Uh, not only from, like,
a coronavirus perspective.

Like, she's
worried that I'm gonna go,

get the disease,
bring it back home.

We're both gonna have it,
it's gonna be horrible.

We'll get the long
term stuff with the bad lungs

and, like, the weird smell.
But then

also from, like,
a different perspective

that I don't really want
to bore you with that 'cause

it's even so weird that
I'm having this conversation

-with you in the first place--
-[neighbor] Yeah--

--and I'm so sorry again,
but I guess what I'm asking is,

do you think it's fucked up
if I hang out with this dude?


How would she know?

[birds squawking]

That...
That is an excellent point

that I did not consider.

And thank you so much.

And again,
I'm so sorry about this.

This was so weird.
I apologize for everything

and who I am as a person.

Um, have a good
rest of your day.

-Uh-huh. Yeah, you too.
-[Naomi] Take care.

What's your name?

Oh, right. Buh, duh.

Um, I'm Naomi.
Nice to meet you.

[window dragging]

Sorry. Sorry,
sorry. Sorry, sorry.

Don't be like that, Sadie.

It's not like
I did it on purpose.

<i>Yeah, but you took your sweet</i>
<i>time, didn't ya babe?</i>

I was talking to my neighbor.
He's like--

He's like a cool Brooklyn dad.

<i>Okay. But I'm also cool,</i>
<i>and I'm in the UK.</i>

<i>I think</i>
<i>that trumps it, doesn't it?</i>

Don't say Trump around me.

Oh, shit. Sorry.

Anyways. I miss,
like, actual New York.

Remember the last
time you came here?

<i>Ugh!</i>


I actually don't
super remember it.

<i>Obviously.</i>

Do you remember the time--

Okay. Do you remember
going to House of Yes

the last time you were up?

<i>You remember the</i>
<i>woman that stroked my back?</i>

The white woman.

She was on
her way to your hair.

She was on her way to
your hair. And she said,

"You just look so beautiful."

And we said--

<i>Uh, ma'am.</i>
<i>I know. I'm aware. Thank you.</i>

<i>But I didn't even feel it.</i>

<i>It was you being like,</i>
<i>"Excuse me?"</i>

Well, there's certainly one
thing I'm not going to allow.

And it's white shenanigans.
Not on my watch.

<i>Speaking of white shenanigans,</i>

<i>what you gonna</i>
<i>do about Sara?</i>

I don't know.

It feels so bad to be critical
of someone who has, like,

been there for me.

I think that being
alone for so long,

specifically without her,

has really given me the time
to reflect and be like...

do I even miss her that much?

And, like,
of course I miss her.

I love her so much.
But it's never-- I don't know.

It's never anything,
like, malicious or,

like, mean or bad.

Like, I don't
think she's a bad person.

It's just, like,
little things, you know?

<i>Yeah, but those little things,</i>
<i>they add up.</i>

<i>And, I mean,</i>
<i>did you even hear, like,</i>

<i>the way you were just talking?</i>

<i>Like, you say one</i>
<i>little thing about her,</i>

<i>and then you have to follow</i>
<i>it up with, you know,</i>

<i>"I love her so much. Like,</i>
<i>I can't wait 'til she's--"</i>

<i>Like, come on!</i>

<i>It feels like you're policing</i>
<i>and self-checking yourself.</i>

<i>Like, she doesn't</i>
<i>necessarily have to sit</i>

<i>in your mind as a bad person.</i>

<i>It's just,</i>
<i>"Have I outgrown her?</i>

<i>Have I outgrown</i>
<i>this friendship?"</i>

<i>Is it one-sided at the minute?</i>

<i>And are you okay with that?</i>


Yeah, you're right.

I-- It's just hard.

You know? I've been
friends with her for so long.

And yes, I said
you were right. Okay?

Write it down. Report it.
Post it to Facebook.

<i>Mm. Ugh. Delicious.</i>

I actually can't tell
how much of that is just

you speaking confidently
with a British accent, though.

So, don't-- Let's not take it
all the way to the heart.

-Right?
<i>-Okay. Okay.</i>

<i>I'm gonna stop you there.</i>

Sadie, how's auntie?

<i>She's good. She's good.</i>
<i>So, you know,</i>

<i>she's a key worker. So,</i>
<i>I just-- I haven't seen her.</i>

<i>I haven't seen her much</i>
<i>in, like, the last six months?</i>

<i>Every time I've seen her,</i>

<i>she obviously</i>
<i>is bringing up Naomi.</i>

<i>"How's Naomi doing?</i>
<i>What's she up to?"</i>

<i>-Blah, blah, blah.</i>
-I've always been

her favorite niece.

[laughs obnoxiously]

<i>I wish you-- Like, I think</i>

<i>she wishes she could have</i>
<i>you as a daughter,</i>

<i>but she's</i>
<i>already got one, so...</i>

Imagine me with
a British accent. Ugh.

<i>You'd be unbearable.</i>
<i>Unbearable.</i>

You're such a bitch.


Oh, my God.
I have to go make dinner.

But I loved chatting with you.

<i>-I love you.</i>
-Thank you for your advice.

Ugh. Thank you [retches].
Thank you for your advice.

<i>I love you.</i>
<i>I love you so much.</i>

I love you, too.
Same time next week?

<i>Mwah. Yes. Perfect.</i>

Love you so much. Bye.

<i>Quarantine night 83.</i>

<i>Of course</i>
<i>Sara's coming back</i>

<i>the night of my date</i>
<i>with Reed.</i>

<i>Don't we just love that?</i>

<i>I just want</i>
<i>someone to touch my butt.</i>

<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I'm asking for too much.</i>

<i>It's human nature. Also,</i>
<i>maybe we can make it work.</i>

<i>Like, Sara's coming</i>
<i>back for the evening.</i>

<i>We're doing</i>
<i>the dinner at night.</i>

<i>So, maybe I can do something</i>
<i>with Reed during the day.</i>

<i>We can go sit six</i>
<i>feet apart at Prospect Park.</i>

<i>Or, I don't know,</i>
<i>get some takeout and sit</i>

<i>on opposite sides</i>
<i>of the bench and...</i>

<i>I dunno. Not make eye contact.</i>

<i>That was some wild shit she</i>
<i>said, though. The MLK thing?</i>

<i>How do you have a Black</i>
<i>best friend for this long</i>

<i>and still fix</i>
<i>your face to say something</i>

<i>stupid like that?</i>

<i>Especially right now.</i>

<i>Like, you can go on</i>
<i>Twitter for 10 minutes</i>

<i>and find threads and threads</i>
<i>of resources and, like,</i>

<i>things to read</i>
<i>to make you not sound</i>

<i>like such a racist idiot.</i>

<i>And I know she's</i>
<i>on Twitter.</i>

<i>It's-- I mean, it's not</i>
<i>my job to educate her,</i>

<i>but also she could take two</i>
<i>seconds to educate herself.</i>

<i>And you think</i>
<i>that she would want to.</i>

<i>Like, she'd want</i>
<i>to support me.</i>

<i>But instead, she's,</i>
<i>like, partying in Florida</i>

<i>with her friends at</i>
<i>a bar in a literal epicenter</i>

<i>of coronavirus,</i>
<i>while I'm up here,</i>

<i>planning her</i>
<i>welcome back dinner.</i>

<i>Maybe Sadie was right.</i>
<i>Maybe she doesn't deserve it.</i>

<i>Maybe I should just</i>
<i>keep my date the way it is,</i>

<i>and she can just wait.</i>

<i>I don't know. I'm probably</i>
<i>overthinking this.</i>

<i>I should just talk to her.</i>

<i>Anyway. I'm going to bed.</i>
<i>Good night.</i>


[phone ringing]

Good morning.

<i>Oh, did I wake you, baby?</i>

You're all right, Mama.

<i>I woke you up.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

That's okay. I shouldn't be
sleeping this late anyway.

-What's up?
<i>-I just miss you, I miss you.</i>

I miss you, too.
How's it goin' down there?

<i>It's going, you know?</i>

<i>We doin'</i>
<i>our little sanitizing thing,</i>

<i>and wash our hands,</i>
<i>you know we're very safe.</i>

<i>We are collectors of all</i>
<i>things disinfectant, so...</i>

[Naomi laughs]

<i>-We have a routine.</i>
-We're doing the same thing.

And cases are, like,
going down.

So, I don't want
you to worry about me either.

<i>I'm-- I'm trying not to.</i>
<i>I know you're smart.</i>

I'm "smaht." Wicked "smaht."

[both laughing]

Um, what's new? What
do you guys got goin' on?

<i>Nohtin', workin' in my garden.</i>

<i>My garden's lookin' hot.</i>

-Oh, shoot!
<i>-I got this big,</i>

<i>giant Volkswagen bus to put</i>
<i>in the middle of my garden,</i>

<i>for all the flowers to grow</i>
<i>through and stuff.</i>

<i>'Cause, you know I'm a hippie</i>
<i>at heart, right? You know--</i>

-You got--
<i>-I like, I love Volkswagen,</i>

<i>so... And it was from my</i>
<i>friend at the flower shop.</i>

<i>She had it as a display</i>
<i>and I asked her about it.</i>

<i>And she said,</i>
<i>"I'mma let you have that."</i>

<i>So, it was--</i>
<i>it was meant to be.</i>

Guess what, Mumma.

<i>What?</i>

So, I've been talking to a guy.

<i>Really?</i>

-Yeah. I met him--
<i>-Is he white?</i>

<i>I'm sorry. You know</i>
<i>I have to ask.</i>

-No, you--
<i>-You know? I want to know what</i>

<i>my grandchildren</i>
<i>are gonna look like.</i>

Every single time.
Every single time. I--

No. He's not white.
To be clear, he's not.

<i>-Really?</i>
-I'm not sure he is.

And it feels uncouth to ask.

<i>I'm so sorry.</i>


<i>Baby. You know you guys</i>
<i>can bring home anybody.</i>

<i>As long as you love</i>
<i>them and they love you,</i>

<i>then we'll love them.</i>

Well, we're not
there yet, but we'll see.

-[laughter]
-But it's just--

It's just been nice to,
I don't know,

have someone to,
like, talk to since Sa--

I mean, Sara's still gone.
She's down

with her parents still. But...

<i>You have to kind</i>
<i>of understand that</i>

<i>from her perspective</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

I get why she-- I mean,

I know you guys would
kill to have me home right now

but I just didn't-- There's too
much of a risk, you know?

Plus, I want to be
here for the protests.

-Like, everything that's--
<i>-Naomi,</i>

<i>I-- I have to tell you,</i>
<i>I'm so proud</i>

<i>of you young people</i>
<i>right now, I really am.</i>

<i>Especially you young kids of</i>
<i>color 'cause I never thought</i>

<i>that you guys would have</i>
<i>to go through some of the shit</i>

<i>that we went through,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

<i>And it-- it was--</i>
<i>it was awful.</i>

<i>But you guys are</i>
<i>organizing and you're smart.</i>

<i>And I look at you and say,</i>

<i>"God, there is hope</i>
<i>for this world."</i>

<i>Because my mother was</i>
<i>a radical and there was a time</i>

<i>when she took us uptown,</i>
<i>we used to call it,</i>

<i>to sit at the Woolworth's</i>
<i>counter to get some ice cream.</i>

<i>And the white waitress</i>
<i>wouldn't wait on us.</i>

<i>She just kept</i>
<i>walking back and forth.</i>

<i>But my mother insisted.</i>
<i>We didn't say anything.</i>

<i>We were dressed in our Sunday</i>
<i>best and we stood there.</i>

<i>And she finally had no</i>
<i>choice because it was almost</i>

<i>the end of the day,</i>
<i>and she waited on us.</i>

<i>-That was your grandmother--</i>
-I love--

I love that Ma
made you do that.

I'm about to become
a Black Panther. This--

This has
radicalized me all over.

<i>I was a Black Panther once.</i>
<i>I told you that story, right?</i>

No!

<i>I love the face. Yep, when--</i>

What?

<i>You know, historically,</i>
<i>people don't realize</i>

<i>that the Black Panthers</i>
<i>got together</i>

<i>for the protection</i>
<i>of the neighborhoods.</i>

<i>And one of the first</i>
<i>things they did was start</i>

<i>a breakfast program, because</i>
<i>if you don't feed kids,</i>

<i>-they can't learn.</i>
-Mm-hmm.

<i>And their headquarters</i>

<i>was on the way to my school.</i>

<i>So, we used to walk there,</i>
<i>get breakfast.</i>

<i>And then</i>
<i>eventually we got the berets,</i>

<i>the black berets,</i>
<i>and a turtleneck.</i>

<i>-And they took us on guard--</i>
-[Naomi] Mom!

<i>And we trained for the</i>
<i>revolution until my parents--</i>

Why have you never
told me this story before?

<i>I thought I did.</i>

<i>We-- We did that until</i>

<i>your grandmother found out.</i>

<i>And that was the end of</i>
<i>my Black Panther experience.</i>

Oh, I'm sure Ma
was thrilled, huh? Thrilled.

<i>-My God.</i>
-[both laugh]

I was talking to Sara.
And she said some,

like, weird... stuff about--

Like, you know, the old
talking points that like,

"Oh, well, people should
be protesting peacefully,"

you know? Or like,

"Oh, well, riots
never, like, got anything done.

Like, you know,
MLK was a peaceful protester."

-And it's like--
<i>-And he still got killed.</i>

That's what I-- I just
don't-- I don't get it.

And it's like, you think--

I've been friends
with her for so long.

We took the same
classes in college.

She's had me,
a Black best friend for, like,

years and it's so wild
that she still hasn't, like--

-learned any of it.
<i>-Naomi. She's scared--</i>

<i>-She's scared.</i>
-I just don't... I don't know.

It's-- It feels strange to,
like, be so close to someone

and live with someone
and them have those opinions.

You know?

<i>Just because</i>
<i>you live with someone</i>

<i>doesn't mean</i>
<i>you need to like them.</i>

<i>Look at me and your dad.</i>

Oh, please. You guys
are obsessed with each other.


[Naomi's dad] <i>Hey, baby.</i>
<i>Your coffee's ready.</i>

<i>-Thank you, baby.</i>
-[Naomi's dad] You're welcome,

<i>-sweetheart. I love you.</i>
-Oh, Speak of the devil.

-Ugh, gross, gross, gross--
<i>-See, your dad just--</i>

[dad laughing]
<i>There you are.</i>

Hi, Papa, what's up?
I can't see you.

Where's your face?
There you are.

<i>My face is right here.</i>
<i>Here I am. Sorry.</i>

<i>I'm-- I'm still adjusting</i>
<i>to all this, uh,</i>

<i>you know, FaceTiming and--</i>

This technology. What's new?

You got anything new going on?

<i>Oh, absolutely.</i>
<i>Hang on one second.</i>

Oh, shoot, what is that?

<i>Don't know what he's bringing.</i>

<i>Might be a new grilling hat.</i>

You know he loves his big hats.

He do love a-- Have
you guys been cooking out?

<i>-Yes, we have.</i>
<i>-Yeah, you seen</i>

<i>the grillin' hat.</i>

<i>Got some new hot peppers.</i>

<i>I got some</i>
<i>jalapenos out there, too.</i>

-You grew those?
<i>-I did.</i>

I got two green thumb parents.
It's a beautiful thing.

<i>-Isn't it?</i>
<i>-It is.</i>

You guys-- Dad,
an excellent job, Papa.

I'm very proud of you.

<i>Well, thank you, I-- You know,</i>
<i>I-- I live for you to--</i>

<i>for those moments</i>
<i>that you tell me</i>

<i>that you're proud of me.</i>

[Naomi laughs] You're too much.

I'll talk to you guys soon.

I'm gonna go hop in the shower.

Um, but you guys wanna, uh,

Facetime maybe later this week?

<i>-Absolutely.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

All right. Cool.

<i>-Naomi.</i>
-[Naomi] Yeah.

<i>Do you think while</i>
<i>you're in the shower,</i>

<i>you might shave your pits?</i>

-Thank you for your wisdom--
<i>-I love you so much.</i>

-Always love to hear from--
<i>-You're so pretty. You know...</i>

I love you--

<i>-Shave your armpits.</i>
-Bye.

Shave your armpits.
-[Naomi's dad laughs]

[line dropping]


<i>Good morning, me.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

<i>It's, uh, quarantine day...</i>
<i>84?</i>

<i>Ah, I was planning</i>
<i>on calling my mom today.</i>

<i>Apparently we were</i>
<i>right on the same page</i>

<i>because she called me</i>
<i>incredibly early this morning.</i>

<i>You know, this is a woman</i>
<i>who got bussed to school,</i>

<i>who took me</i>
<i>to pro-choice protests for,</i>

<i>when I was like, little, for</i>
<i>as long as I could remember.</i>

<i>She went to college and</i>
<i>became, like, an Angela Davis,</i>

<i>giant Afro,</i>
<i>Black power feminist.</i>

<i>I've seen</i>
<i>the pictures.</i>

<i>And she still has</i>
<i>the nerve to give me shit</i>

<i>about having armpit hair?</i>

<i>Gotta love her.</i>

<i>Oh, as of this morning,</i>

<i>when my</i>
<i>unemployment check cleared,</i>

<i>I officially have 10K</i>
<i>in savings. Can you believe?</i>

<i>I officially have enough to</i>
<i>move in by myself if I want.</i>

<i>I can have my own place,</i>
<i>like a real adult.</i>

<i>I could have</i>
<i>an in-unit washer-dryer.</i>

<i>I could have a dishwasher.</i>
<i>I could have a dishwasher.</i>

<i>I could have plants.</i>

<i>I could have plants</i>
<i>and keep them alive.</i>

<i>I could be a mother.</i>
<i>But it's like...</i>

<i>do I want to move</i>
<i>in to a place by myself?</i>

<i>Or do I want</i>
<i>to just not live here?</i>

<i>-Hello?</i>

<i>Hey! Good to see you.</i>
<i>Are you naked?</i>

<i>-Oh, good.</i>

Um, best friend
says what?

<i>What!</i>

-Wow, I just--
<i>-Oh, my God, I--</i>

-hit myself in the eye--
<i>-Yeah, I--</i>

<i>Mine was so weak.</i>
<i>I'm getting so rusty.</i>

Yeah. What's wrong with us?
Oh, my God.

<i>Well, I haven't seen</i>
<i>you in so long. It's-- I'm--</i>

<i>I'm like-- I'm basically,</i>
<i>like, not a person anymore.</i>

Yeah, I'm like a hull.
I'm more of a hull.


Um, okay, quickest thing.
Um, so--

<i>Are you pregnant?</i>

No. Oh, my God.
You know I wish. Uh! Um--

-[Sara laughs]
-So. Okay.

Right before
you texted me last night,

um, Reed had
texted me and was like,

"Hey, I'm free on Friday.

Do you want to, like,
make actual plans to hang out?"

And so, I was wondering
if there's any chance

that you would be okay
with rescheduling

our welcome back dinner
so I can go on the first date--

ah!-- with this dude in ever.
Um, would that be okay?

<i>Um...</i>

<i>Heh. I don't know.</i>
<i>I feel kind of like...</i>

<i>I'm just surprised.</i>
<i>I guess I was--</i>

<i>My reaction--</i>
<i>I'm realizing that</i>

<i>I really did want to do it.</i>

<i>Like, I wanted to have</i>
<i>a good-- But it's fine.</i>

<i>-I'll just--</i>
-No, no, no. Oh, my God. I--

-[Sara speaking indistinctly]
-Obviously, I want to do it.

I was, like,
really looking forward to it.

I was thinking
that maybe we could literally

just reschedule
it to Saturday night.

Or even, if you want,
like, a brunch on...

on Saturday morning?
That could be fun, right?

<i>Yeah...</i>

<i>Wait, so you were gonna,</i>
<i>like, go on a date with him</i>

<i>and then you'd want to get,</i>
<i>like, brunch the next day.</i>

-Well, we'd make--
<i>-But what about, like, COVID?</i>

Sorry, I-- You cut out.

<i>Just what--</i>
<i>I-- Just-- Sorry.</i>

<i>What about like-- I was</i>
<i>just thinking about COVID.</i>

<i>Like, so you're going</i>
<i>to hang out and then like,</i>

<i>we're just-- we would eat</i>
<i>the next morning to get--</i>

<i>like, I don't know,</i>
<i>I feel like--</i>

<i>That's just, like,</i>
<i>kind of, like, confusing to me</i>

<i>based on the rules</i>
<i>that I'm seeing online.</i>

Yeah. Um, obviously,
we would totally be safe.

And I've been
being safe up here.

-[Sara speaking indistinctly]
-The household is COVID-free.

<i>Yeah, no, sorry.</i>
<i>I just-- I think, like--</i>

<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I just was, like, really--</i>

<i>I've been really</i>
<i>looking forward to it.</i>

<i>Like, I haven't seen</i>
<i>like, a friend in so long.</i>

<i>And I was so looking forward</i>
<i>to, like, I don't know,</i>

<i>making dinner</i>
<i>but it's-- it's totally fine.</i>

<i>And I totally see, like,</i>
<i>that changing it one night</i>

<i>is not going to change</i>
<i>things in the way</i>

<i>that it feels like it's--</i>

<i>It's-- I'm just having</i>
<i>a reaction</i>

<i>and I'm-- It's fine.</i>

Um. Okay. Let's just
have the dinner. I'm sorry.

-I didn't mean to, like--
<i>-No--</i>

-- make it weird-- No, no, no.
I didn't mean

-to make it weird. I'm sorry--
-[crosstalk]

<i>... talking about it nonstop.</i>

<i>You've been talking</i>
<i>about going on the date</i>

<i>non fucking stop</i>
<i>and the dinner won't--</i>

<i>like, literally</i>
<i>won't be fun if you want</i>

<i>to have gone</i>
<i>on a date instead.</i>

No, it's gonna--

<i>So, I don't even</i>
<i>wanna do a dinner</i>

<i>-if it's not gonna be fun.</i>
-It's gonna be-- can-- Okay.

-Sara, realistically--
<i>-What?</i>

--can you picture you and I

not having a good time,
sitting,

stuffing our faces
together and drinking

your mom's shitty wine?

<i>Well, no, I really, really--</i>

<i>That's what I want.</i>

And it's gonna
happen because I--

I'm not even cut up--
This is a-- This is a guy.

Have you ever
known Naomi Parsons

to be caught up over a dude?
Be honest. Like, it's not--

<i>-Once in a while [indistinct].</i>
-Truly not a problem.

<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Reed's not going anywhere.

I'll hang out
with him another time.

We are gonna have
our dinner tomorrow

and I'm so excited. Um...

Also, like, that means
I get to go to the Co-op

and get groceries, which
is like-- you know I love

-that shit.
<i>-Oh, my God, I love the Co-op</i>

<i>-so much.</i>
-I love going to the Co-op.

It's also, like,,
that's kind of, like,

the only human contact
I have in my life right now.

-So, it's like, I can't wait--
<i>-You'r ready.</i>

-- to go get some groceries,

hang out with my--
my Co-op people.

Um, I'm gonna get
some wine too.

<i>Okay, but text me</i>
<i>about what you want to get</i>

<i>because obviously</i>
<i>I want to be a part of, like,</i>

<i>-the cooking and stuff.</i>
-Wait, should we just decide

right now?

<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>
<i>So, get, like, some vegetables</i>

<i>that look really</i>
<i>good or seem special.</i>

<i>And then, cheese!</i>

<i>-Wine.</i>
-We have to do

the cheese plate.
We have to do the cheese plate.

<i>-Yeah, that was so good.</i>
-I'm gonna get--

You-- You're gonna
make me do it.

I'm gonna get
a triple cream brie.

<i>Please! Like, that--</i>
<i>Get that one we got last--</i>

<i>I took a photo of the label.</i>
<i>I'll send it to you.</i>

Yeah, text it to me.

<i>Okay, yay. Okay. I'm excited!</i>

Um, I'm excited too.
I can't wait to see you.

-Um...
<i>-Me too.</i>

Love you so
much and see ya soon. Ah!

<i>Okay. Love you, bye.</i>

Hey, Naomi!

Oh, hey! How's it goin'?

Hey, how are you?

Um, you know, I've been better.

I'm eating macaroni
and cheese, uh, directly out

of the pot so I think
that says a little somethin'

about, uh, where
my head's at right now.

Um, but how are you?

Ah, doin' all right.

Hey, listen. I been
thinkin' a lot about your,

uh, situation.

Uh, I think you should
just be honest with yourself.

No reason to sneak around.

You clearly want to hang
out with this guy, you know?

So, just put your foot down.
Life is short.

Yeah.

You're right. And, like,
I think in an ideal world,

I would have, like,
a best friend and roommate,

who I could be
honest with about things

without expecting
some kind of, like,

passive aggressive backlash.

Um, you're absolutely right.

Everybody's right.

I appreciate
you thinking about it.

Yeah.

Um, thank you. I'm gonna
to go put this into a bowl

and sit on the couch and
eat it, um, to maintain some

semblance of normalcy
and feel like I'm not spiraling

out of control,
but again, thank you so much.

Um, have a good
rest of your day.

Yeah, you too.

All right. Awesome.
Bye, little one!

Hello-- Ooh. Girl.

<i>-Oh! Ah, are we drinkin'?</i>
<i>-Yeah. Oh--</i>

-Oh!
-[laughter]

<i>-Hey. Hoo.</i>
-[Naomi] Cheers, y'all!

-[excited chatter]
<i>-Hey y'all.</i>

Look at us. What's up?

<i>I somehow thought that you--</i>

<i>You were gonna</i>
<i>ignore that we were--</i>

<i>You know,</i>
<i>I sent the Zoom request--</i>

<i>-I was close, but...</i>
<i>-Yeah, I felt you weren't--</i>

<i>'Cause you didn't</i>
<i>respond to the text messages.</i>

<i>I had to put on a shirt!</i>

To respond to texts?

<i>Mentally, yeah.</i>

<i>-It's a state of mind.</i>
-[laughter]

I will say that I am desperate
for human contact right now,

so I am
thrilled that you called--

<i>I'll take what I can get.</i>
<i>Um, I have a reason.</i>

<i>So. Okay, I saw online,</i>
<i>on Twitter, whatever,</i>

<i>that apparently</i>
<i>Carson Wentz is mixed.</i>

<i>You know who he is? So,</i>
<i>he's a Eagles football player.</i>

<i>So, I look into this, right?</i>

<i>The tweet disappears 'cause</i>
<i>you know how Twitter be.</i>

<i>And it turns out</i>
<i>that I had misread</i>

<i>and that wasn't true at all.</i>
<i>Or I just can't read.</i>

<i>Actually, it turns</i>
<i>out Pete Wentz is Black.</i>

<i>Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy!</i>

<i>Did you know this?</i>

He's half-Jamaican.

<i>That story had so many</i>
<i>turns in it.</i>

<i>Are you guys</i>
<i>just being pretentious</i>

<i>or did you actually know this?</i>
<i>'Cause--</i>

<i>Wait.</i>
<i>I have crazy news. Wait.</i>

<i>Did you know that Mariah Carey</i>
<i>is half-Black?</i>

<i>See, Khadijah,</i>
<i>that's why a little bit,</i>

<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"I hope she doesn't answer,"</i>

<i>'cause I knew she's gonna</i>
<i>say some smart-ass shit.</i>

[all laughing]

<i>That's why. That's--</i>

<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to be disrespectful to me.</i>

<i>I just came</i>
<i>here with some words</i>

<i>-to share with my friends--</i>
<i>-I can't-- I cannot.</i>

<i>It was a shocker</i>
<i>because when I thought</i>

<i>about the music</i>
<i>and then him, I said,</i>

<i>"Girl, why didn't</i>
<i>you think that before?"</i>

<i>That's what I'm saying,</i>
<i>so I wanted to share that.</i>

<i>I should've called my white</i>
<i>friends. That's what</i>

<i>I should've done 'cause they</i>
<i>would've been like, "Oh,</i>

<i>you always tell us somethin'</i>
<i>we didn't know."</i>

<i>You just, "I should've</i>

<i>called my white</i>
<i>friends"-ed us.</i>

<i>I oughtta kick you</i>
<i>out the zoo.</i>

I feel like, okay, you have to
take into consideration

the current political climate.
Like,

-are they gonna to be, like,
<i>-Don't bring that in.</i>

actually thrilled to be like,
"Oh, my God, Pete Wentz, yeah,

half-Black." Or are they just,
like, patronizing you?

<i>You know what? How are y'all?</i>

<i>-How are you doing?</i>
-[laughter]

We're doin' okay. I'm okay.
Wait, you guys taking

care of yourselves?
I miss you. This is horrible.

<i>On a scale of, like,</i>
<i>one to 10,</i>

<i>I'd say I'm doing six,</i>
<i>which is good considering--</i>

That's like pandemic good.

<i>Yeah. I think that's really,</i>

<i>really good. It-- It--</i>

What are the protests
like in L.A. right now?

<i>Uh, you know, I went to</i>
<i>one and, um, it is definitely</i>

<i>a mix of people</i>
<i>who are there,</i>

<i>who really care, you know?</i>

<i>People who are really trying</i>
<i>to be a part of the change.</i>

<i>And then you have people</i>
<i>who are definitely</i>

<i>there because they need</i>
<i>to take some pictures.</i>

<i>So, it's really sifting</i>
<i>through that. We actually,</i>

<i>um, you know,</i>
<i>went to one, me and Khadijah,</i>

<i>where it actually wound up</i>

<i>being a music video</i>
<i>instead of just a protest.</i>

<i>So, that was really...</i>

<i>There was a girl</i>
<i>I'll never forget--</i>

<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

<i>She got on the mic,</i>
<i>and I was like,</i>

<i>"All right, here we go. Like--</i>

-[Lyssa] <i>Yeah--</i>
<i>-People are gonna speak from</i>

<i>their heart. And then she</i>
<i>started singing, I think,</i>

<i>"We Are the World"</i>
<i>by Michael Jackson.</i>

<i>And then that folded</i>
<i>into a Whitney Houston song.</i>

<i>And then that folded</i>
<i>into "Fly Like an Eagle."</i>

<i>And then that folded into--</i>
<i>She just wanted to sing!</i>

<i>one girl that wouldn't wear</i>

<i>a mask and she was</i>
<i>over there being cute.</i>

<i>Like, "Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Why do I need to wear a mask?</i>

<i>Um, like, I'm just</i>
<i>at a protest with a bunch</i>

<i>of Black people who are</i>
<i>the most marginalized group</i>

<i>here during this pandemic."</i>

<i>She to me was like,</i>
<i>"Basically, you should just</i>

<i>be happy that I'm out here."</i>

<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"You could go home."</i>

<i>And her and all</i>
<i>her friends were like,</i>

<i>"Put on your mask, it's okay."</i>

<i>And she was like, "Fine."</i>

<i>So, that's the climate in L.A.</i>

<i>What's it like there?</i>

Now I feel like I'm
bragging 'cause I went

to a protest and, like, the
only issue I had with it is,

I mean, obviously, A, the
police were just beatin' people

-up with reckless abandon.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

And B, it was like,
um, I was alone, you know?

Like, my roommate
is still in Florida.

So, I was just, like, by
myself. But also, I don't know.

I was watching
people get, like,

batoned and
pushed over by the cops.

And, like, random people
who didn't even know them

coming and, like, scooping
them up and helping them.

And, like, asking
if they need water

and asking if
they need, like, medical care.

It was really beautiful.

New York comes
together when it has to.

And everyone
was wearing a mask.

<i>I wish you weren't by</i>
<i>yourself. That's scary to me.</i>

Yeah, it's weird.
It's been... Nice.

<i>Oh, that face.</i>

Y'all mind if
I pop off real fast?

Y'all mind if
I pop off real fast?

<i>Honey, welcome</i>
<i>to the Red table.</i>

<i>I can't!</i>


<i>What's on your mind,</i>
<i>girlfriend?</i>

Okay, so, um...

So, she's been gone
and I miss her, obviously.

She's my best
friend in the whole world.

And, like, I've known
her for so long but she--

I've been talking to this guy--

<i>Yeah, you said. You told</i>
<i>us about the other day--</i>

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Reed.
We still are talking.

And he's, like, great.

<i>So, what's the deal?</i>
<i>Are you guys gonna, like,</i>

<i>meet up soon?</i>

We-- Okay.
We talked last night.

And we made kind of a solid
plan to hang out, right?

I was really excited.
Feeling myself.

And then right
before I went to bed,

I got a text from Sara.
"I'm coming back on Friday."

<i>In two days on Friday. She's</i>
<i>giving you two days notice?</i>

Yeah, she told
me this Wednesday.

And, like, Sara
and I had plans to have

this big elaborate,
like, welcome back dinner,

which I assume is going
to take place on Friday night

'cause that's when
she would be coming back.

Do you think I should
reschedule with Reed

and just save
myself the headache

of her being pissed about it?

Or what? What do I do?
Like, I--

<i>Did you just</i>
<i>hear yourself talk!?</i>

<i>I'm not even gon' say nothin'</i>

<i>because let me tell</i>
<i>you something, Naomi.</i>

<i>Like, I know</i>
<i>that's your friend and all</i>

<i>but, like... Like, I don't--</i>
<i>Like, I just feel like...</i>

<i>You know, that girl's</i>
<i>not my type of people.</i>

<i>I'mma just say that. Can I--</i>

<i>'Cause I feel like</i>
<i>I shouldn't say that much</i>

<i>because I...</i>

<i>Lyssa doesn't</i>
<i>want to say that much.</i>

<i>And Lyssa doesn't</i>
<i>have to say that much.</i>

<i>So, I will say it.</i>
<i>She stinks!</i>

<i>Every time you talk about her,</i>
<i>there's some sort of problem.</i>

<i>-Not stinks--</i>
<i>-She stinks, man!</i>

<i>Okay. Okay.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

<i>Well, I'mma-- I'm gonna</i>
<i>piggyback off of what--</i>

It's all in
the open now, let's just--

<i>Yeah, I mean-- I-- 'Cause we--</i>

<i>Me and Khadijah</i>
<i>talked about this--</i>

<i>Popcorn. Pop to Lyssa.</i>

<i>We've talked about</i>
<i>this before, me and Khadijah.</i>

<i>And you are our friend so we</i>
<i>don't want to talk about,</i>

<i>you know, like, your friend.</i>
<i>But I just want to say to you,</i>

<i>you know, you don't have</i>
<i>to stay friends with someone</i>

<i>just because you're</i>
<i>friends with someone.</i>

<i>You don't</i> have <i>to do that.</i>

<i>Oop.</i>

<i>I'm just sayin'--</i>

Why you always
gotta say something

that cuts so deep?

<i>I don't like Sara,</i>
<i>really, if I can be honest.</i>

<i>Like, well,</i>
<i>as a person, it's not--</i>

<i>It's just like, she just--</i>
<i>Every time you bring her up,</i>

<i>it's always stuff like this.</i>

<i>Like, she's so, just</i>
<i>exhausting and time-consuming.</i>

<i>Like, you need</i>
<i>to put rules on some</i>

<i>of your friendships,</i>
<i>too, if that makes sense.</i>

<i>Like, she can't just</i>
<i>keep ruining your schedule</i>

<i>and taking up</i>
<i>your space and your energy</i>

<i>and controlling</i>
<i>your life. Like,</i>

<i>we would talk about</i>
<i>a guy like this</i>

<i>and be like,</i>
<i>"Who does he think he is?"</i>

<i>And you also</i>
<i>should be able to feel safe</i>

<i>telling her that,</i>
<i>"Hey, girl,</i>

<i>um, I'm hanging</i>
<i>out with this guy I just met."</i>

<i>Because if you told one</i>
<i>of us that, we would be like,</i>

<i>"Oh, girl,</i>
<i>go get you some dick."</i>

<i>But she really</i>
<i>wants to consume</i>

<i>all of your time and space.</i>

<i>And those are all</i>
<i>of my words that lead</i>

<i>into Khadijah's</i>
<i>point which is--</i>

[exaggerated Italian accent]
<i>Ah, she a-stink!</i>

I just--

I get where
you guys are coming from.

And how do you let
go of something that has

been so good
to you for so many years?

Or how do you even
come to terms that maybe--

With the fact that,
like, maybe it hasn't been

that good for
you for that many--

I don't--

-[Naomi groaning]
<i>-I think it's the latter.</i>

<i>It's soundin' a lot</i>
<i>more like the latter.</i>

<i>If you keep trying,</i>
<i>trying, trying, right?</i>

<i>It's like you're</i>
<i>two glasses of water--</i>

<i>Follow me-- Right?</i>
<i>And that's friendship, right?</i>

I'm here. I'm here--

<i>You fill-- You help</i>
<i>fill each other up, right?</i>

<i>But if there's</i>
<i>a hole in the other glass</i>

<i>and you keep filling,</i>
<i>filling, filling,</i>

<i>that glass is sucking</i>
<i>everything out.</i>

<i>There's nothing left</i>
<i>to give back to you.</i>

<i>-You know what I mean?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

-[Khadijah, indistinct]
-That was beautiful.

<i>-When you do metaphors--</i>
-That was beautiful--

<i>-- you're like...</i>

<i>I be tryin'.</i>
<i>I be tryin', you know?</i>

Sometimes I'm like,
I know you got a comm degree,

but you could have also
double-minored in philosophy.

-You know what I mean?
<i>-I don't really think</i>

<i>I could have,</i>
<i>'cause all my metaphors,</i>

<i>they start with glasses.</i>
<i>It's just--</i>

<i>-No.</i>
-[laughs]

<i>If you start a metaphor</i>
<i>with a glass or two of water,</i>

<i>you'll find</i>
<i>your way to the end.</i>

<i>I just think that right now,</i>
<i>you can just, like,</i>

<i>cut out the fat</i>
<i>because the fat</i>

<i>is not really helpful</i>
<i>moving forward.</i>

<i>Part of the reason I call</i>
<i>you guys is because I can</i>

<i>trust you guys</i>
<i>and I love you guys.</i>

<i>And I don't</i>
<i>really have too much space</i>

<i>for anything else.</i>

<i>Look at the world right now.</i>

<i>How much space</i>
<i>and time do you have,</i>

<i>for people who are not...</i>

<i>helping you, like--</i>

I get it.
And you know what?

<i>I'm gonna take what</i>
<i>y'all said into consideration.</i>

<i>consideration, what an honor.</i>

Next time. De--
Definitely next time.

Like, this time, I'm
for sure gonna have to just,

bite the bullet
and, like, reschedule my shit

'cause I'm not
mentally prepared to deal--

<i>We spent all this time</i>
<i>for you to not listen to us?</i>

<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>No. I didn't sign up for that.</i>

<i>Naomi!</i>

Listen. Personal growth is--

It's not a marathon.

-Well, it is--
<i>-It is--</i>

Personal growth is a marathon.
It's not a sprint. Okay?

Can you give me
a frickin' break?

<i>You said--</i>
<i>You said the wrong thing</i>

<i>because you know you're wrong!</i>
<i>Sprint it!</i>

<i>Take a performance-enhancing</i>
<i>drug and run, kid!</i>

Maybe this is,
like, the one last time

that I just reschedule so
I don't have to deal with it.

And then in a couple days,
we can have this conversation

and I'll move out, or I'll do
whatever I have to do.

-And we can just--
<i>-No, no, no.</i>

<i>Because it's not</i>
<i>gonna be the last time.</i>

<i>You have to just</i>
<i>rip the Band-Aid off.</i>

<i>You are trying</i>
<i>to peel it off slowly</i>

<i>and you've been</i>
<i>doing that for a really</i>

<i>long time with this girl.</i>
<i>Once again, I don't know her.</i>

<i>But I don't</i>
<i>really like her like that.</i>

<i>So, I would love</i>
<i>to not be stressed out</i>

<i>by the conversation</i>
<i>about her, you know?</i>

-[Lyssa speaking indistinctly]
<i>-Yeah, I wanna</i>

<i>have stressful conversations</i>
<i>about, like, Reed texts.</i>

<i>Let's do that instead.</i>
<i>That seems so much more fun.</i>

<i>I want--</i>
<i>I wanted to talk about how</i>

<i>Pete Wentz was mixed.</i>

<i>And here we are</i>
<i>talking about Sara.</i>

<i>Lyssa, I got one for you.</i>
<i>Vin Diesel's Black.</i>

<i>Is she lyin'?</i>

<i>Lemme look this up.</i>

Lyssa. Lyssa.

[Khadijah laughing]

<i>-Wait, are y'all serious?</i>
-What?

-[Khadijah] <i>Vin Diesel's Black.</i>
-To me, Barney was Black.

And also Arthur
from the TV show, <i>Arthur.</i>

The Brain is also Black.
The Brain celebrates Kwanzaa.

I actually think everyone in--

in the Arthur Universe
is Black,

except for Binky,
who is Dominican.

<i>Binky is Dominican</i>
<i>or Cape Verdean.</i>

Okay, let's take it easy.

<i>I'm sorry,</i>

<i>but Binky is high</i>
<i>yellow Cape Verdean.</i>

<i>That's why he's yellow.</i>
<i>'Cause Binky's high yellow!</i>

Wow!

<i>Did you guys know Kimora</i>
<i>Lee Simmons was half-Black--</i>

<i>I can't really have fun</i>
<i>on my own, can't I?</i>

-Lyssa.
<i>-We gotta let--</i>


I'm gonna duck out before
she realizes that Barack Obama

is Black.
I love you both--

<i>-Hey, what?</i>
-[Naomi] Thank you guys so much

for talking to me.
I will do my best

and I'm not
making any promises.

So, the next time we talk,
don't--

don't come for me.

All right?

<i>Bye.</i>

All right.
I love you both. Bye.

-[smooching]
<i>-Love you. Bye!</i>

Bye. [sighs]

[muffled screaming]

[pieces clattering]

[phone ringing]

[water dripping]

Did you just flush the toilet?

<i>What, you-- you heard that?</i>

Are you-- Yeah.

<i>Oh, fuck. Uh, let's pretend--</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

<i>Let's not even pretend 'cause</i>
<i>I'm just gonna go ahead</i>

<i>and say it:</i>
<i>you got a sÃ©ance going on</i>

<i>in your place right now.</i>

Okay. Okay.

I am in my frickin' feelings.

I think I deserve
to light a candle--

<i>I feel like you--</i>
<i>you're summoning the devil.</i>

That feels
a little like it goes

against my religious roots.

And I don't super appreciate
it, but also if I summon

the devil,
then I guess we'll just chill.

I got a couple bottles of wine.
I'll crack 'em open.

<i>Okay. Now, that's just</i>
<i>hanging out and fun now.</i>

Yeah, chillin'.
What's your night been like?

<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>it's been so fucking boring.</i>

<i>I was, um... So,</i>
<i>you know I've been freelancing</i>

<i>-with that guy I told you--</i>
-Yeah.

<i>about, editing</i>
<i>his video or whatever?</i>

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

<i>Like a Zoom meeting.</i>
<i>And he stood up.</i>

<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>you're expecting me to say</i>

<i>this dude's hog was out.</i>
<i>That's not what happened.</i>

<i>He stands up and he's</i>
<i>in his boxer shorts.</i>

<i>And so, I was like,</i>
<i>"Okay, that's kind of weird,</i>

<i>kind of funny but</i>
<i>at least he's not like--</i>

<i>I'm not seeing</i>
<i>this dude's shwangus."</i>

<i>-And he stands--</i>
-[Naomi] Sure, sure, his meat--

The meat is-- is in the pants.

<i>-The meat is contained.</i>
-Yes.

<i>Um, but he stands up and he</i>
<i>hits the corner of the desk.</i>

-[gasps]
<i>-And he lets out the most</i>

<i>insane yelp I've ever</i>
<i>heard in my life. It's--</i>

-Dude!
<i>-It was so--</i>

He freaking bunned his weiner.
I would do the same thing!

<i>Bunned his wiener.</i>


<i>How's your day been?</i>

<i>I mean...</i>

<i>Can we talk</i>
<i>about something quick?</i>

<i>Go ahead.</i>

Um, literally right after

we made solid plans last night,

Sara texted me
and was like,

she's coming back tomorrow.

And we have
been talking for, like,

a couple of days
about when she gets back,

we were going to do
this whole elaborate

welcome back dinner.
I'm going to go to the Co-op.

I'm going to get groceries.

And let's say...

it seems like the time

that we would be
doing that would be

dinner time tomorrow,
which also seems, like,

maybe the time
that we would be hanging.

<i>-Yeah.</i>
-And I thought like,

"Oh, maybe I could--
We could do, like, a day hang.

And then
I could, like, you know,

have the welcome back
dinner in the evening.

But it's like,
what if our day hang turns

into and evening hang,
you know?

So, I'd rather just hang out
on a day that we have,

like, all the time
in the world.

Um, and I also don't want
to deal with her

being passive
aggressive towards me.

<i>Sure. And she'd</i>
<i>be angry about that?</i>

<i>Like, us hanging out?</i>

No, she's not--
She wouldn't be mad.

Like, mad is the wrong word.
It's just like,

I just don't feel
like dealing with that.

And I also don't
want her to have to deal

with that after,
like, months of being away.

-Like, she deserves a good
<i>-Sure.</i>

Night first night back,
you know?

And I also just-- I don't--

I haven't
walked on eggshells in...

like, since she's been gone.

It's, like, not that I don't
know which eggshells

to step on, you know? Like,
I've been walking on eggshells

for our whole friendship.
And I know where to put

my feet. Right? Like, there's
some quail shells, right?

They're, like, feeble,
they're weak, they shatter.

There is, on the other
hand, like, an emu shell,

an ostrich shell,
like, it's thicker.

And you want to
step there to avoid, like--

-[Reed laughs]
-crushing all these little

egg-- Oh, my God.
This is so stupid.

I can't believe
this came out of my mouth.

<i>You know what?</i>

<i>I'm coming over.</i>

<i>Naomi,</i>
<i>I am coming over tonight.</i>

What are you talking about?

Coming over where?
Coming over here?

<i>I'm going to that sÃ©ance</i>
<i>in your place right now.</i>

<i>-I'm coming over.</i>
-Wait, you're serious?

<i>Yeah! Uh, I mean,</i>
<i>if that's cool with you. Yeah.</i>

Like, you-- You're-- you're
gonna come over here, tonight?

Like, we're going
to hang out tonight?

<i>Uh, and the situation</i>
<i>ideally would be</i>

<i>you would text</i>
<i>me your address.</i>

<i>I would show up at your place,</i>
<i>potentially with food.</i>

<i>And we would hang out.</i>

Uh...

Okay, yeah, absolutely.
Um, fuck.

<i>All right. Cool. Let's do it.</i>

<i>Oh, one-- one-- one--</i>
<i>one-- one request on my part.</i>

-Yes.
<i>-I gotta see that crazy dress.</i>

Oh, dude, that was
already gonna be-- be worn.

It's not a problem.

<i>Just text me your address</i>
<i>and I'll be there.</i>

I gotta clean my
apartment. All right.

I will text right now.

Um, word. I will--

<i>-Cool.</i>
-see you soon, I guess?

<i>Yeah. All right. Awesome.</i>
<i>I'll see you soon, Naomi.</i>

Oh, my God!

[line dropping]


["A Long Stroy Short"
by Betoko]

â™ª

Oh. Hey, how's it goin', Reed?

Oh, hey Reed.

Yo, what's up, Reed?

No. No, no, no.

No, no, no, no, no.

â™ª

[music fades out]


<i>Okay. This is, um,</i>
<i>quarantine night 84.</i>

<i>Reed's coming over. Like,</i>
<i>he's coming here to my house.</i>

<i>over to this house.</i>

<i>I-- I don't even</i>
<i>know how this happened</i>

<i>but he's, like, on his way.</i>

<i>I don't really know the rules.</i>

<i>We're supposed</i>
<i>to stay six feet apart</i>

<i>but he's, like, in my house.</i>

<i>Do we keep the masks on?</i>

<i>What if we hook up?</i>
<i>What if he's the one?</i>

<i>What if it works out?</i>

<i>Like, what if</i>
<i>some random dude I met</i>

<i>on a random dating app</i>
<i>works out for me?</i>

<i>And we get married</i>
<i>and we end up together.</i>

<i>And we get an apartment</i>
<i>and we have little babies.</i>

<i>And of course, they're brown.</i>

<i>And I'm not sure</i>
<i>exactly which kind of brown</i>

<i>because I haven't</i>
<i>really asked.</i>

<i>And it could actually</i>
<i>be, like, a quarter white.</i>

<i>I'm not totally sure</i>
<i>how to broach that topic.</i>

<i>I'm gonna lose my mind.</i>
<i>I'm so excited!</i>

<i>I never get</i>
<i>to do spontaneous shit</i>

<i>like this when Sara's here.</i>

[phone ringing]

<i>Well, look who it is.</i>


-Hey, what's up?
<i>-Hey, nothin'...</i>

How's it going?
Best friend says what?

<i>-What?</i>
-[both laughing]

<i>-You look good.</i>
-Thank you.

I figured I'd zhuzh
myself up for myself tonight,

you know.

<i>Yeah. Well, okay,</i>
<i>so I-- I've been thinking</i>

<i>about it and I feel</i>
<i>really uncomfortable with...</i>

<i>you having</i>
<i>a date in our apartment.</i>

<i>And I'm-- I'm</i>
<i>just, like, panicked. Like--</i>

Sara, I'm-- First of all,

not having
a date at the apartment.

Like, he's not coming here.

If we go on
a date when we reschedule,

it's going to be outside. Like,

I don't want
you to worry about that,

you know, like...

<i>But if you're outside</i>

<i>and then you go inside</i>
<i>and then you, like,</i>

<i>touch our stuff, I feel like</i>
<i>you're not taking</i>

<i>it seriously. And, like,</i>
<i>it feels like you don't even</i>

<i>care that I could</i>
<i>get it from this.</i>

<i>What?</i>

Are you being
serious right now?

<i>Of course I'm being serious.</i>
<i>I'm freaked out.</i>

You just said that I'm
not taking it seriously, Sara?

I stayed in
New York City through, like,

the worst of this pandem--

Like, you weren't here
for the refrigerator trucks

full of dead bodies outside.

You weren't--
Like, the woman at the YMCA

down the street fucking died.

She caught
coronavirus and died.

You know the relationship
I have with that woman.

She's so kind. Like,
to say that I'm not taking

it seriously is, like, pretty
fucked because I'm witnessing

the death and destruction
and just chaos all around me.

And for you
to say that of all people,

someone who was, like,
literally going out in Florida

of all places,
to the bars, not wearing masks

with your friends,
just partying all night,

getting drunk to the point
where you don't even

remember what
you were drinking--

To say that I'm not
taking this pandemic seriously

is like, a little bit rich,
you know what I mean?

Not to be rude,
but, like, come on now.

<i>'Kay, I went</i>
<i>to a bar one fucking time.</i>

<i>And I'm sorry</i>
<i>I haven't been in New York</i>

<i>but I had to be with</i>
<i>my family, it's my family.</i>

<i>-I'm sorry. I do-- I--</i>
-That's not what I'm saying.

And you don't have
to apologize for that.

It's just, like,
I really don't appreciate--

<i>It's not my fault</i>
<i>people are dying.</i>

<i>It's not my fault</i>
<i>that it's so fucking scary.</i>

<i>And I'm sorry</i>
<i>I don't know what it's like</i>

<i>but I'm doing</i>
<i>my own thing here.</i>

<i>Things aren't good here.</i>

They're not good there.

And that's why I don't
understand why you would say

that I'm not taking it
seriously when you're going

out in a place
that you admit is not good.

It doesn't make any sense.

You're being such
a hypocrite right now.

<i>I don't understand,</i>

<i>like, why you're</i>
<i>yelling at me?</i>

<i>I-- This doesn't make</i>
<i>any fucking sense. Like--</i>

I'm not yelling.
It's just like--

<i>You are yelling.</i>
<i>You're yelling at me.</i>

<i>And it's like, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>You're my one fucking friend.</i>

<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

Sara.

<i>-What?</i>
-Sara.

[exhales forcefully]

Have you considered that
this is not about coronavirus?

Like, this is not
about the pandemic, right?

Because you obviously
don't care about the pandemic

if you're gonna go
out raging with your friends

at a bar in one
of the hot spots--

<i>-It was one time!</i>
-Let me finish. Let me finish.

It was more than one time.

And you know that 'cause
I'm on your close friends

on your stories on Instagram.

So, like, why are
you lying to me about this

when you know that I know
what the truth is, right?

Have you considered
that maybe you just don't

like when I do things that
maybe could not involve you?

Have you considered
that maybe the idea

of me dating this guy
means that you're not

going to be up my
ass all the fucking time?

And we're gonna
spend every second

of our lives together?

And that's been
the way that it has been

since we've known each
other for our whole friendship?

And you are terribly
afraid of that happening?

I think you're being kind of
a bitch about this whole thing.

Sorry. I'm not
trying to be mean.

And I realize that saying
the word "bitch" is,

like, mean. And you're my best
friend in the whole world.

But, like, think
a little bit deeper.

I think you're being kind
of fucked up to me about this.

<i>So, you think I'm just</i>
<i>in your shadow all the time?</i>

<i>You think I'm just</i>
<i>trying to hang out with you,</i>

<i>and you don't even</i>
<i>want to hang out with me?</i>

That's not what I said.

It's just, like,
things have changed

and we have evolved
past who we were--

<i>You have evolved!</i>
<i>Sure! You've evolved!</i>

<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>You have a fucking boyfriend.</i>

<i>You have a fucking nice life!</i>

I don't have a boyfriend.
I've never even met this dude.

I want to hang
out with him once, Sara.

<i>Wha-- I-- I don't--</i>

<i>I understand.</i>
<i>Like, okay, fine.</i>

<i>I'm a fucking stunted</i>
<i>or whatever. And I'm like--</i>

<i>Whatever.</i>
<i>But I didn't think that--</i>

<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>that us being friends</i>

<i>was just</i>
<i>you being fucking bummed</i>

<i>that I want to hang out</i>
<i>and talk all the time.</i>

<i>I thought it was, like--</i>

That's literally
not what I said.

Sara, I have not been
out of the house in months.

I've not been out
of the house in months.

All I want to do
is go on one date.

One date, where
we're six feet apart.

And we can't even see
each other's faces,

'cause we're wearing masks.

And I really don't think
that I'm asking that much.

And the fact
that you're harping on this

is, like, so indicative
of how you've been

for our whole friendship,
do you realize that?

Like, I feel like I can't
have anything without you.

<i>So...</i>

<i>What the fuck</i>
<i>am I supposed to do?</i>

I think you're
supposed to get over the fact

that I'm gonna go
hang out with a person once.

I'll wash my hands
when I come home. Okay?

Like, I'll take my
clothes off at the door.

I'll-- Whatever you need me
to do, I'm doing this.

I'm sorry. I'm doing it.
Like...

<i>You're being such a fucking</i>
<i>bitch. Like, this is crazy.</i>

<i>You're just gonna do</i>
<i>something?</i>

I guess it kind of fucking
takes one to know one, right?

We have so much
in common, right?

We spend all
this time together.

I guess we're
both bitches, right?

[door buzzes]

That's-- I ordered
a pizza and it's here--

<i>I was so excited</i>
<i>to come back--</i>

I ordered a pizza and it's
here. I have to go get it.

I'm sorry.
I will talk to you later.

<i>No! You can't fucking go.</i>
<i>This is crazy--</i>

[line dropping]

[door buzzing]

-[Naomi] Hey!
-[Reed] I brought the pizza.

didn't believe you, but here--

-Cool if I come in?
-[Naomi] Whoa, um, come on in!


Uh... Okay, I'll get this.

-[Naomi] Oh, it's the top lock.
-[Reed] Yeah.

Sorry, second to top lock.

-[Reed] Okay. Yeah, okay.
-I-- Yeah.

They really should be universal
at this point. You know, like--

-[Reed] There's-- I'll-- Yeah.
-a-- like a shower.

-[Reed chuckles]
-[Naomi] Anyway, uh...

-[both laugh]
-[Reed] This is crazy, right?

I can't believe. This is-- Wow.

Um, do you want
a glass of wine?

Yes. That would be cool.

Um, I'll grab some glasses.

Do you want
meet me at the couch?

Uh, cool. Whoa, this is nice.

Oh, thank you.

I actually, uh, built
the place myself.

-This is very good pizza.
-Yeah, I'm like, not--

Honestly, there was a lot
of ricott-- and I'm a fan.

And I was like, "Ooh,
is this gonna be too much?

Am I gonna be overwhelmed?"
I'm feeling great.

So, you're happy with
the amount of ricott--

I'm really, really...

Are we dropping the A?
Ricott?

-Ricott.
-[rolls R] Ricott!

-[laughs]
-[rolls R] Ricott!

I knew it. You're Italian.

Uh, yup. Naples.


Should we, like, do something?

Sure. You got
a board game or something?

Do I have
a board game or something?

Did I ask something strange?

No, no, no. I-- I just
thought this was a date,

not a playdate, but, um...

I have cards.
You wanna play some cards?

We can play Go Fish.

-[chuckles]
-[Reed laughs sarcastically]

-No, for real--
-Now, what does Joker mean?

Joker. Ah, they're actually
not supposed to be in there,

but I guess it means, like,
you can just put it down

and then put whatever
you want on top of it. Right?

Cool, uh, this and
then this, and then spit.

-You're such a fucker.
-Okay.

-Eight. Nine, nine--
-Oh!


What the freakin'--

I actually did warn you
that I was good at this game.

It sucked.
It sucked what you just did.

It sucks what I just did.

But also,
you suck at the game of Spit,

so I don't know
what to tell you.

-That's fair. That's fair.
-You wanna play again?

-Let's do it.
-[both chuckle]

I'll tell you what.
I have a game.

You are absolutely
going to love it.

-I am 100% in. I can't wait.
-You don't care what it is?

I'm just gonna
tell you what it is--

Tell me what-- I mean,
it's a game.

It's a movie game and
now we're about to do it.

It is the
Leonard Maltin Movie Game.

Woo-hoo!

Yeah, I'm really--
Hold on. I'm really excited.

[Reed laughing]

I'm going to say
a year from a movie,

-so I'll just pick a year.
-Okay.

I'll give
you a clue for that movie.

-Mm-hmm.
-And then I'm gonna

read the cast from bottom up.

And in that process,
as soon as you know the movie,

just scream the name out.

-The year is the year 2000.
-Ah, excellent year.

-Turn of the millennium.
-Mm-hmm.

-Pre-911. Yeah.
-Y2K.

I knew that you were gonna--

I just knew
that you were gonna be

the one out of us two to bring
up 9/11 on a first date.

-Why is that? Huh?
-You just seem--

Huh, I wonder why that is. Huh.

What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

I wonder why <i>he</i> would
be the one to bring that up.

-[laughter]
-Okay. Okay.

First of all, I was leaning
Latino. See, my thing is,

I bring up the Atlantic
slave trade on a first date.

-Sure.
-And my friends are always,

like, "Why do you do that?"

And I'm like,
"Because it applies."

-I think you do have it.
-No, I definitely do.

-I think you do have it.
-I definitely do.

Um, is it
the film <i>Heavyweights?</i>

Should we move to London?

-Let me think.
-Is this too sudden?

No, actually,
I think it's perfect timing.

-Yeah.
-But I've always felt like

more of a Newcastle guy.

What's--

Uh, ah... Oh, my God.

My cousin, Sadie, would
fucking kill me right now.

[both laughing]

I also-- You know what I love
about, uh, British television

is that you don't
have to be super hot.

You just have
to be a good actor.

-What's this guy's name?
-That's Jeremy.

-Okay.
-And that's Super Hans.

He's tied Super Hans
to a bed because Super Hans

is trying to kick
the drugs that he's on.

-Mm-hmm.
-I'll make you watch this

for the rest of the night.

We won't do anything else.
Don't frickin' tempt me.

Sure. Sure, sure.

We'll watch <i>Peep Show</i> for
the rest of the night. Cool.

[Naomi laughs]

So, I'm staying for
the rest of the night?

I mean, you're already here.

I can't send a poor
drunk man spilling wine

all over himself
out into the night.

-[Naomi laughs]
-I gesture when I speak.

Okay, that's because you're--

A fun guy.

Cheers.

[both laughing]

-Should we make out?
-Yep.

[both laugh]

Your hair is so soft.

Thank you. I've been
practicing to get it softer.

You've been practicing
to get your hair softer?

Yeah. Yeah. For in case
this instance happens--

I need you-- I need you to stop
talking.

You didn't even
call my hair soft.

-I haven't touched it yet.
-Okay, we're good.

I don't want
to be inappropriate.

There's one thing
I know is you don't touch

a Black woman's hair. [laughs]

I'm out of here.

[both laughing loudly]

[horn honks]

Is it morning already?

The sun's blasting.

-Fuck.
-Yeah.

Um, I feel like I should
eat so that I'm not hungover.

-Mm-hmm.
-Are you hungry?

I could eat.

What could I make-- Oh.

Um...

Have you ever had
pizza reheated in a cast iron?

I can't say I have, no.

I'm about to blow your mind.
Watch this.

gonna be fucked up.

Wait. Actually.

I have to do
something really quick.

I'll be right, right back.


<i>Okay, so this</i>
<i>is quarantine day 85.</i>

<i>I have to be really</i>
<i>quiet because Reed</i>

<i>is, like, right there.</i>

<i>Ah!</i>

<i>We did that. And it was fine.</i>

<i>Like, it was perfectly fine.</i>
<i>And he's really sweet.</i>

<i>And is it a little bit</i>
<i>fucked up that I had somebody</i>

<i>who doesn't live here over,</i>
<i>during a pandemic?</i>

<i>Sure. But, like,</i>
<i>he's really smart.</i>

<i>And I feel like he's, like,</i>
<i>respectful, and I trust him.</i>

<i>And I know that I do,</i>
<i>because we have had</i>

<i>to take all this time to,</i>
<i>like, get to know each other</i>

<i>when we literally</i>
<i>couldn't hang out in person.</i>

<i>And I feel like normally,</i>

<i>it's like, you go</i>
<i>from meeting on Tinder</i>

<i>to, like, fucking</i>
<i>and never hearing from them</i>

<i>again in two and a half days?</i>

<i>And we've had,</i>
<i>like, almost four months.</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I guess-- I just trust him.</i>

<i>And I don't think</i>
<i>that he would put either of us</i>

<i>at risk to get this disease.</i>

<i>You know, I've trusted dudes</i>
<i>before with mixed results.</i>

<i>But I feel good</i>
<i>about this one.</i> [laughs]

<i>Yeah, I don't know.</i>
<i>He's so kind.</i>

<i>And, like, his hair</i>
<i>is even softer in person,</i>

<i>if you can believe.</i>

<i>And I'm definitely</i>
<i>going to get a UTI.</i>

<i>Like, for sure.</i>
<i>I know my body.</i>

<i>I-- I should have peed.</i>

<i>Do you have to pee</i>
<i>after you get fingered?</i>

<i>They don't really</i>
<i>teach that in health class.</i>

<i>Do people still say,</i>
<i>"getting fingered"?</i>

<i>Maybe I'm out of touch.</i>

<i>Anyway. Part of me, like,</i>
<i>half-expected this dramatic,</i>

<i>sexy night</i>
<i>with, like, my concubine</i>

<i>forbidden to me</i>
<i>by my evil stepmother.</i>

<i>Probably a little</i>
<i>strange that my brain</i>

<i>immediately assigned Sara</i>
<i>as my evil stepmother, right?</i>

<i>Definitely some Freudian</i>
<i>shit there I gotta work out</i>

<i>but I don't have</i>
<i>time to unpack right now.</i>

<i>Speaking of, I...</i>

<i>hadn't really</i>
<i>thought about Sara at all.</i>

<i>Like, until this</i>
<i>moment since our--</i>

<i>Not argu-- Was it an argument?</i>

<i>I don't know. I don't</i>
<i>feel really good about it.</i>

<i>And like, did</i>
<i>I lie directly to her face</i>

<i>saying that Reed</i>
<i>wasn't going to be here? Sure.</i>

<i>But, like, it was last minute.</i>
<i>Like, I wasn't expecting it.</i>

<i>And I certainly wasn't</i>
<i>expecting that fight</i>

<i>last night. And...</i>

<i>She's never gonna</i>
<i>find out, right? Like...</i>


<i>No. I'm glad</i>
<i>it's out in the open.</i>

<i>I'm glad we're saying</i>
<i>something about it because--</i>

<i>I'm actually-- You know what?</i>
<i>I'm proud of myself,</i>

<i>because I stood up for myself.</i>

<i>And I feel like</i>
<i>normally when we get</i>

<i>into these</i>
<i>conversations, I like,</i>

<i>bring something</i>
<i>that's hard for her</i>

<i>to understand</i>
<i>about herself up.</i>

<i>And I'm met with like--</i>

<i>she brushes it off or she gets</i>
<i>really defensive</i>

<i>and starts crying.</i>

<i>And it-- I turn out</i>
<i>apologizing somehow.</i>

<i>And I'm sick of that,</i>
<i>like, this is something</i>

<i>that has</i>
<i>happened more than once.</i>

<i>And it's not just</i>
<i>about the pandemic.</i>

<i>It's, like, about</i>
<i>our friendship, obviously.</i>

<i>And like, one time</i>
<i>I made a bunch of baked ziti,</i>

<i>and I slaved over that baked</i>
<i>ziti. And it was delicious.</i>

<i>And the next day</i>
<i>there was a whole pan</i>

<i>of leftovers in the fridge.</i>

<i>And I got back</i>
<i>from work and she'd,</i>

<i>like, eaten most of it,</i>
<i>and she said she thought</i>

<i>it was because I was leaving</i>

<i>town that weekend,</i>
<i>but this was a Thursday,</i>

<i>so why would</i>
<i>I leave town on a Thursday?</i>

<i>Like, I was leaving</i>
<i>town that weekend,</i>

<i>but I would leave Friday.</i>

<i>And it turned into, like,</i>

<i>her crying and me saying sorry</i>

<i>for her eating my baked ziti?</i>

<i>That ricotta was expensive.</i>


<i>I did call</i>
<i>her a bitch to her face.</i>

<i>Not that I have any problem</i>
<i>with the word "bitch".</i>

<i>Like, we're taking it back.</i>
<i>That's ours.</i>

<i>And she called</i>
<i>me a bitch, too.</i>

-[sighs]
<i>-I don't know.</i>

<i>I just feel like we need</i>
<i>to, like, talk about things.</i>

<i>Maybe we should go</i>
<i>to, like, couples counseling.</i>

<i>No, that's weird.</i>
<i>Why would I say that?</i>

<i>Like, we don't need</i>
<i>to go to couples counseling.</i>

<i>We're not a fucking couple.</i>
<i>We're just--</i>

<i>She's my friend. And--</i>

<i>Maybe she's not</i>
<i>even my friend.</i>

<i>Like, maybe</i>
<i>that's what this is.</i>

<i>Maybe we've just</i>
<i>outgrown each other.</i>

<i>And I have 10K</i>
<i>in the bank for the first time</i>

<i>ever in my whole life.</i>

<i>I can move out.</i>
<i>I could go on my own.</i>

<i>I could find</i>
<i>an apartment in Brooklyn</i>

<i>for 10K for at</i>
<i>least a couple of months</i>

<i>until I, inevitably,</i>
<i>have to go back home</i>

<i>and live with my</i>
<i>parents because the pandemic</i>

<i>has decimated the economy</i>
<i>and I don't know</i>

<i>if I'm gonna</i>
<i>be able to find a job.</i>

<i>Why am I even-- What am</i>
<i>I spiraling about right now?</i>

<i>I have a whole</i>
<i>ass man on the couch,</i>

<i>who I could make out</i>
<i>with and who I owe pizza.</i>

<i>-I owe him cast iron--</i>
-[doorbell buzzing]

Um, should I answer that?

Yeah, do you mind?
You can just open the window.

It's probably
just the delivery guy.

He can leave it downstairs--

[Sara, distant]
Can you let me in?

I can't find my fucking key.

[window opening]

[Sara, louder]
Who the hell are you?

that's a loaded question.

Why are you in my house?

I'm a friend of Naomi's.

[phone ringing]

Shit.
