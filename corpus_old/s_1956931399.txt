       So, we got               
       the results back.        

            And...?             

       You're on Premium 3.     

  You have an alternative here  

        that most people        
        nowadays do not.        

              Am I dying?       

       -If I am, just--         
       -You're not dying.       

              Yet.              

    Your heart is definitely    
    failing though.             

     You can be saved           
     with the right donor,      

but time is your biggest enemy. 

    And accidents               
    are so rare these days.     

   -What about a clone organ?   
   -When you're dead,           

      you'll be eligible        
      for a total upgrade.      

 Look, there are no short cuts. 

Premium 3                       
is technically there            

to protect your spouse,         
to make sure                    

she's not left alone            
with a burden                   

of raising three kids.          

It's not there                  
to benefit you, per se.         

            [SIGHS]             

      I suppose your wife       

could put in a request for you. 

    It's uncommon,              
    but State might approve     

    under the circumstances.    

    Well, we're                 
    kind of separated, so...    

        It says here...         

      you're still married.     

    We just never completed     
    the paperwork.              

            Got it.             

     Look, my wife insisted     
     on doing                   

     everything virtually.      

  I feel                        
  there are still some things   

 that you have to live through  
 in the real world.             

  Like being told               
  that your heart is failing.   

            [SIGHS]             
            Exactly.            

     You're a clone, aren't you?

  You asked for a day meeting.  

   I'm sure                     
   you can guess the answer.    

    Do you ever go out there    

      and look at the sun       
      with you own eyes?        

     I mean, it doesn't burn    
     your kind, right?          

              [¶¶]              

    It's called                 
    augmented pigmentation.     

   One of the many advantages   

    of the cloning process,     

        but don't envy me.      

  There are limitations         
  beyond the Premium 3 cases.   

  I am going to book you        
  a meeting with a therapist.   

  I think it would do you good  
  in these trying times.

That's what I'm so upset about. 

 Is that a good enough reason?

       to say to me?

   No, don't say sorry.

   What I'm trying to tell you  
   is that what I see in here   

  is that CHIP is taking over.  

   We need to stop investing    
   in VR tech.                  

       We need to focus         
       all our resources        

  and energy

     Are you afraid to die?     

       All normal people        

       are afraid to die.       

You're afraid to die            
because it comes with           

something like a grade          
for your achievements in life,  

  or lack thereof?              

      Yeah, something like that.

You surprised I understand you, 

me being a clone and all?

          Something's missing.  

                   When I look  
                   in your eyes,

     I see reason, wisdom,      

                 but no instinct

Why, you think                  
your boring wife                

can't be as dirty               
as some other whore             
in the room?                    

        It's not what you think.

  Well then,                    
  what is it?

     I'm outside your door--    
     if you don't answer,       

   I'm going to break it down.  

 [SCOFFS]                       
 What the hell                  
 are you doing here?            

I still have                    
a restraining order             
against you.                    

I'll call the cops              
and you're gonna be locked up.  

    -Is that what you want?     
    -No.                        

         I want to talk to you. 

          I need to talk to you.
          Please.               

No.

                  No--          
                  Please, Reena.

          I need to talk to you,
          the real you.         

            Can I-- Can I just  
            come inside for     
            a few minutes?      

 No. The kids are here.         

       Well, but that's great.  
       I'd love to see them too.

Well, they're connected         
and I'd rather                  

they don't know you're here,    
so don't make a scene.          

                   [SIGHS]      

I'll put something on           
and come out.                   

[DOOR CLOSES]                   

All right, I'm here.            

Speak.                          

               So, um...        

                I'm dying.      

    Yeah. You told me.          

             Come on, Reena.    

       What do you want?        

              Look, we're, uh...

              The house is      
              this one and mine.

                 We're in a lot 
                 of debt, Reena.

              We're still paying
              mortgage on both. 

Debt?                           

No, we've been                  
paying it off for years now.    

            I've been paying it.

And I have been raising         
our kids                        

while you've been off           
doing your daytime bullshit,    

so don't treat me               
like I'm worthless.             

            No, I'm just saying,

        if I go,                
        then all these payments,

           who's gonna make 'em?

Well, what about                
your insurance?                 

Plus, we're on Premium 3,       
so your clone                   

is just gonna come in           
and take over your job.         

                Yeah, but see,  
                there's, uh,    

          there's this new thing
          called CHIP.          

         Yeah, I know           
         what CHIP is.          

         Jenny has it.          

  Everyone who's worth a damn   
  has it.                       

    All of our kids' friends    
    at school have it.          

         No, no, don't encourage
         the kids with the shit.

Hey, you don't get              
to decide anymore, okay.        

I don't want to hear it.        

                 My company     
                 might go under.

              The board, they're
              these rich men    

                from Europe,    
                old money.      

            I tried to tell them
            about CHIP, I tried,

         but they don't want    
         to hear it, they're all

            still stuck on VR.  

  What are you trying to say?   

             If we go under,    
             then my job        

          will cease to exist.  

                And equally bad,
                they're won't be
                any company     

            to cover            
            the life insurance. 

      Oh, okay, I get it.       

   All of this is just          
   you trying to renegotiate.   

    [SCOFFS]                    

 That's why                     
 you wouldn't sign the papers.  

    You're a sneaky bastard.    

     I bet you're not even      
     really dying, are you?     

  No, I'm not trying            
  to go back on our agreement.  

  I'm worried about you         
  and the kids, don't you see?  

     I don't have a plan B!     

      When I go,                
      I want to make sure       

                 that you're all
                 taken care of. 

       Yeah, well,              
       you figure it out.       

That's the one fucking thing    
that you're good at.            

              I...              
              I'm trying, but...

          [SIGHS]               
          It would help to have 

             a little more time.

           Look, I was wondering

              if maybe you would
              make a request... 

                Forget it.      

  You know, I just              
  can't follow you sometimes.   

                 What is so hard
                 to follow?     

       If I die,                
       my company will go under.

             If I have          
             a little more time,

          I think I can save it.

              What is even wrong
              with you anyhow?  

They say my heart               
is failing.                     

Like it's slowing down          
or something.                   

I don't feel any pain.          

Heck, I don't feel              
anything at all,                

but that's what they say.       

              [¶¶]              

           That's pretty ironic.

      Why?                      

            Because when we met,

     I thought for sure         
     you were gonna be somebody.

           You know,            
           you had this passion.

     It's like your heart       
     was beating twice as strong

         as anyone I'd ever met.

Can you just                    
take your Lithium X             
like everybody else             

and figure out                  
a solution before you go?       

            Please.             

That way, you won't be          
going out like such a loser.    

              [¶¶]              

         ADAM:                  
         Yeah, I'm looking      
         for "Jerry Fischer"?   

 I know it's a retirement home, 
 I can see it.                  

       No, I understand         
       you're all asleep,       

       I just thought           
       maybe some of them       

 might get up for the sunlight? 

      Good for the bones.       

     No, you wouldn't know,     
     not anymore.               

  Look, I need to talk to him.  
  Can I leave a message?        

   Donald Stein                 
   has a chip on his shoulder   

     and I want to help him     
     remove it.                 

      Okay? Donald Stein.       
      That's it.                

  What happened?                

      Hey, are you crying?      

    I don't think               
    I've ever seen you cry.     

   ADAM: It's--                 
   It's not me you're seeing,   

      even though               
      I wish you could see      
      the real me somehow.      

     What do you look like      
     in the real world?         

    Do you want to tell me?     

    ADAM:                       
    I look exactly the same.    

   -Exactly?                    
   -Down to the last detail.    

    I love the way you look.    

  ADAM: Heh, you're programmed  
  to love the way I look.       

    No, you gave me             
    "AI freedom," remember?     

  I can love whatever I want,   

        whoever I want.         

        And I love you.         

   ADAM [SCOFFS]:               
   What do you love about me?   

    I love your eyes,           
    the way you look at me.     

   I don't think anyone else    
   can look at me this way.     

     ADAM:                      
     How do I look at you?      

      Like how is               
      the sun and the moon      

    the mother and the whore    
    all at once?                

       ADAM:                    
       But not the wife.        

        I know my place.        

     Why wish for something     
     you can't have?            

  ADAM:                         
  Yeah, but why have anything?  

 Why do we need to possess      
 someone in order to love them? 

  We can love three kids,       
  but only one woman? One man?  

      I don't really know       
      what love is.             

    Your dictionary says        
    it's an "intense feeling    

      of deep affection."       

      If that's true then,      

   I think I might love you.    

      ADAM: But in order        
      to feel truly loved,      

       I need to know           
       that you chose me.       

   And in order to choose me,   

     you'd have to be real,     
     to have options.           

      To be more than           
      just my own fantasy.      

      That's a lot              
      of high talk, Adam.       

   How long have you been       
   skipping your medication?    

    ADAM: You know, somehow,    
    you're the only one         

     who can ask me that        
     without upsetting me.      

    'Cause I understand you     
    better than...              

       anyone out there.        

 <i> We're both trapped in a world</i> 

     <i> that doesn't live up</i>

  I want to know what it feels

     Who the fuck are you?      

          How'd you get in here?

 You think that little          
 fingerprint lock can stop me?  


   You don't even know          
   who I am, do you?            

         Donald Stein?          

         Fifteen years          

  Fifteen fucking years         
  I stay out of the limelight,  

     and then I get a call?     

Adam Bird?                      

        How in the fuck         
        did you find me?        

    And what the fuck           
    do you know about CHIP?     

                   Y-y-you don't
                   need that.   

       I'm dying anyway.        

             That's why I looked
             for you.           

          Honestly, you've no...

          [SCOFFS]              
          Get dressed.          

 Let's take this show           
 to the living room, shall we?  

              [¶¶]              

When I said get dressed,        
I was thinking more like PJs.   

     I wanted you               
     to take me seriously.      

 Nothing more serious           
 than this, my friend.          

Well, you better tell me        
a very, very good bedtime story,

because of my time at life,     
sometimes my fingers just--     

       I think you invented it. 
       CHIP.                    

  I don't know why you're hiding
  in some retirement home       

  instead of about to be        
  the richest man alive, but... 

   You with state?              

Ah, fuck,                       
I should've known.              

    I didn't think              
    a daytime person            
    fit the profile,            

     but hey...                 

      [SCOFFS]                  
      I'm not with state.       

     What, is this a test?      

   They watching me?            

 I kept my mouth shut!          

         [WHISPERS]             
         I kept quiet.          

             Honestly, I'm--    
             I'm not with state.

  -Then what the fuck is this?  
  -I just-- I just--            

    -Huh?                       
    -I just need your help.     

  -With what?                   
  -I have to save my company.   

     -For what?                 
     -For-- For my family.      

     See, and it all rests      
     on CHIP.                   

Who told you                    
I invented CHIP?                

               No one, I swear. 

         See, uh-- Uh--         

     I was at my doctor's,      
     and she reminded me        

      about "Premium 3."        
      Now, I didn't think       

 anything of it at the time,    
 but suddenly it dawned on me.  

         Like a sign from above.

        You know,               
        it all clicked.         

   I knew I had to find you.    

 MALE STATE CLERK:              
 Okay, how we all doin' today?  

  Let me first just say,        
  congratulations to you both.  

           Thank you.           

    Your accomplishment         
    is very rare these days.    

            Accomplishment?     

          Three kids.           

I mean, I'm not sure            
that you're aware,              

but we are experiencing         

a massive decline               
in population                   

over the last few decades.      

You know, people                
aren't getting married anymore. 

   They're barely having sex.   

Fewer and fewer                 
want the responsibility         

   or the burden                
   or raising real children.    

      Yeah, well, we know.      

     My-my husband              
     works for Tech Broker,     

 so he's at the very forefront  

      of the technological      
      revolution.               

     I wouldn't expect you,     

   out of all people,           
   to father three children.    

    No, you see, for me,        
    it's the exact opposite.    

    Knowing the risks           
    has made me aim much bigger,

         a proponent            
         for the physical world.

We love the sound               
of that here at State.          

You know, I think               
all those people                
out in the realm,               

they forget that                
they still need                 
their physical bodies           

in order to experience          
everything that they do there.  

       I, for one,              
       am a true believer       

    that nothing can replace    

    the true sense of touch.    

          The warmth.           

     Of another human body.     

                   Okay, Mr....?

       Ryan. Dennis Ryan.       

     With all due respect,      
     what's this about?         

      State is very aware       

 of the many challenges         
 that today's would be parents  

        are facing, and as such,

   State is highly committed    

       to ensuring that         
       our plant survives       
       in good order            

for the many future generations 
to come.                        

    So what, is there           
    some kind of allowance?     

          No. Heh. No.          

 Nothing like that, Mrs. Bird,  

though our name may deceive you.

   We put together a program    

     that will protect          
     the future well being      

     of the modern family.      

    It's called "Premium 3."    

      And it was designed       
      and spearheaded           

    by our very own             
    chief genetic engineer.     

      What, Donald Stein?       

      Him and no other...       

       You invented "Premium 3."

     And even before,           
     you were right there.      

    I mean,                     
    from the very beginning,    

  they called you               
  the father of human cloning.  

I need a drink.                 

   I'm happy to fix you one.    

Do you smoke?                   

         What does it look like?

You know what I mean.           
How?                            

                I've got a guy  
                who's got a guy.

You think we--?                 

            How did you find me?

They pitched me                 
this roam tracker.              

It hacks                        
every listed VR member          

in the Dental Association.      

      Dental record, huh?       
      Clever.                   

Then it looks                   
for virtual X-rays              

that match                      
more than one identity.         

You may be                      
the smartest man alive,         

but Jerry Fischer               
and Donald Stein                

have exactly                    
the same cavities.              

Not to mention,                 
the same dentist.               

           [LAUGHING]           

[ADAM LAUGHING]                 

Yeah...                         

Why did you fall off            
the grid?                       

I mean, they said               
you went mad,                   

but judging                     
by your paranoia,               

I'd say you were pushed         
out the door.                   

    Why don't you file that     

      under none of             
      your damn business,       

      and you tell me what      
      all this has to do        
      with CHIP.                

  So how exactly does it work?  

    Well, you both fill out     
    an application.             

  Now, the application allows   
  for a little bit of leeway,   

       not too much,            
       but the idea being       

 to satisfy                     
 the remaining mournful spouse, 

   there is a little leeway.    

   What do you mean, leeway?    

     You can tailor             
     your insurance spouse,     

      a bit, so that            
      maybe they come back      

      to you just perfect.      

         Perfect, how?          

  Well, I mean,                 
  that's all very subjective,   

      but take Reena here,      
      for example.              

    And I'm not...              
    I'm saying you love her.    

     There's no doubt           
     how much you love her,     

 but maybe aren't there things  

that you might think            
to yourself,                    

"What if...?"                   

                       No.      

         That's great.          

           True love.           
           Very rare.           

      But if there              
      was anything, well,       

    now there's                 
    a little bit of leeway.     

                [REENA CHUCKLES]

    You keep on saying that.    

I do. I do.                     

Now, if you choose              
to proceed,                     

you'll both fill out            
the application                 

in complete confidence--        
no one ever finds out           

what their other spouse         

 may or may not wish to change, 

    but then, again,            
    if the unfortunate event    

          does arrive,          

     you'll have something      
     to look forward to.        

        I-- I don't know        
        about this.             

      Mr. Bird, your clone      

        will still have         
        all of your DNA.        

       your genes,              
       your general look,       

     as well as                 
     most of your memories,     

      your thoughts,            
      your predisposition.      

   We just left a little bit    
   of room for improvement.     

      How long is               
      the eligibility for?      

 Well, the policy will protect  
 your entire household          

 till the last child turns 18.  

      Then, one would hope      
      that your child           

would become                    
less of a burden.               

     Um, what do you mean,      
     the entire household?      

         The kids too?          

   Yeah, until the age of 18.   

Now, of course,                 
we wouldn't have you            

fill out any paperwork          
on them                         

      unless, God forbid,       

     tragedy calls for it.      

    [COMPUTER DEVICE WHIRRS]    

   How does that concern me,    
   or CHIP for that matter?     

       Clones don't burn.       

    It's called                 
    augmented pigmentation.     

 But "augmented                 
 pigmentation"                  

 was not on the sheet.          

All the choices you gave us     

in "Premium 3"                  

were about maximizing           
our human potential,            

things that we could train      
to do better,                   

or else improve                 
through surgery--               

but there's no training,        
no surgery.                     

It can teach my brain           
to increase pigmentation.       

Even if you cloned it,          
it wouldn't work.               

Not unless you added            
something in the process.       

           You mean, like a CHIP
           that would trigger   

             heightened reaction
             in your skin cells?

         Or else pump endorphins
         to your brain...       

         so you wouldn't have   
         to take a pill anymore?

Well, you said it.              

              [¶¶]              

It all started                  
as a military grade             

limb replacement program.       

Sure enough,                    
everything went drone,          

and my department               
became obsolete.                

No more injured soldiers        
to fix.                         

But then,                       
the big heat up happened,       

and it created                  
this sudden desperate need      

for augmented day workers,      

so they just diverted           
the whole program.              

They gave us permission         
to start resurrecting the dead. 

  And human cloning was born.   

          I gotta say,          

        it really does something
        to a man--              

                 creating life, 
                 out of nothing.

You could just have a baby--    

          Yeah, but that leaves 
          everything to chance--

   what we were doing eliminated
   the factor of surprise.      

           We knew exactly      
           who we were getting--

           perfect, trained,    
           and most importantly,

             perfectly satisfied
             state personnel,   

              workers           
              whose sole purpose

           was to work          
           solidly, brilliantly,

          under the blazing sun.

You mean like                   
biological robots?              

                          Mm-mm.

          I mean like           
          enhanced human beings.

     Well, that was a bit funny.

  ADAM:                         
  I can't believe we said yes.  

                     Why?       

        You're the one          
        that's always so worried

             about our survival.

Well, this isn't                
about survival.                 

This is about, deep down,       

you wanting me to be            
slightly different.             

    Why do you always have      
    to look at things like that?

      Look, I wouldn't want     
      to live without you, okay?

     Is that such a bad thought?

So did you ask for me           
to come back                    

   exactly as I am?             

            Did you?            

I asked you first.              

   -You're such a hypocrite.    
   -I'm just--                  

  They said,                    
  "just a little leeway"?       

But then there are all these    
pages and pages and categories. 

      How is that helpful?      

   I thought it was interesting.

    It allowed me               
    to imagine you at your best.

 Do I want to be better? Sure.  

But the person I love,          

I don't want them               

to imagine me                   
any different.                  

I want them to love me          
as I am.                        

           And that is          
           completely relatable,

                of course it is.

                I've been there.

               And what I needed
               to cure that     

       was a smartly constructed
       virtual lover.           

  You had a virtual lover too?  

        It's not what you think.

Well then,                      
what is it?                     

It's just an avatar.            

It's not a real woman.          

She doesn't exist.              

REENA:                          
But she does exist, right?      

                   In your mind,
                   she exists.  

        You think of her        
        when you have a hard-on.

                    Her, not me.

Well, what about you?           

I mean,                         
when was the last time          

    -you even looked at me?     
    -[SCOFFS]                   

                 Have you looked
                 at me lately?  

Yeah! And I see                 
a beautiful 37-year-old woman   

who can easily be               
10 years younger.               

Then I think to myself,         
for all this expensive          

skin care regimen,              
what's it for?!                 

            I mean, you never   
            leave the house.    

                  It's certainly
                  not for me.   

     Oh, my God, you think      
     that I have someone?       

              Is that           
              such a crazy idea?

You're pathetic.                

I'm pathetic?                   

I sacrifice                     

everything for you,             
for us.                         

You didn't sacrifice shit!      
You just gave up.               

      And then you used me      
      and the kids as an excuse.

      What, you think           
      that I didn't have dreams,

 that all I wanted was          
 just to be a stay-at-home mom? 

   Wait, enlighten me, Reena.   

 What was your big dream again? 

        Because I don't         
        really remember.        

     All you ever do            
     is dive on the realm.      

 I don't even know              
 if that counts as being home.  

    That's where                
    your kids are, asshole.     

   You know, they don't want    
   to play soccer or catch.     

 I meet them there              
 and you could've done the same 

        if you wanted           
        to spend time with them,

           instead of wasting it

       on this stupid           
       realm order whore.       

I didn't mean                   
to hurt you, Reena.             

            [SCOFFS]            

I just needed some comfort.     

             So...              

                  Unhappy.      

                 Have you       
                 ever considered

            that by going       
            against the current,

               you're making    
               yourself unhappy?

        Don't you think         
        there's a reason        
        they invented Lithium X?

            You, you say        
            you hate the realm, 

         but you choose to sleep
         through the night      

    when the few people         
    you can actually engage with

                   are awake?   

        Of course you're lonely.

   You'll never be happy        
   until you accept the fact    

   that there is nothing        
   too exceptional about you.   

      You're just average.      

       -[SCOFFS]                
       -But that's okay,        

    'cause I-I like average.    

       Average is stable.       

        You can count on        
        average.                

   Is that what you asked for   
   if I die?                    

The most average version of me? 

  'Cause I have                 
  a hard time believing that.   

      You're fucking impossible,
      do you know that?         

               Look, if you want
               to stay with me, 

               you're gonna have
               to delete her.   

       I want to be on the realm

          and I want            
          to see you delete her.

         Either that, or you get
         yourself a good lawyer.

                  I won't--     
                  I won't do it.

                        I can't.

          I get that you want   
          to make me feel small,

             but I can't let you
             kill our trust.    

             [SOBS]             

        Kill our trust?         

   After what you've done,      
   you want me to trust you?    

      That is a big laugh.      

  Look, if we can't trust       
  each other, then we're doomed.

          It doesn't matter what
          I do, we're doomed.   

How can I trust you             
when you won't even             
delete a stupid avatar          

   -to show me that you care?   
   -It's not about that!        

        It's about the fact that
        you need the validation 

         that you don't trust me
         not to do it again!    

    -I don't trust you.         
    -Then what's the point?!    

You cheated on me!              

              I used a sex doll.
              Hardly cheating!  

There was AI avatar             
at the other end                
of that sex doll.               

I spend five times              
the amount of hours             
on the realm that you do--      

I know how real an avatar       
can feel.                       

You-you felt something          
for this-this thing.            

I mean, what do                 
I even call it?                 

          -Maria.               
          -Oh, what?!           

       -That's her name.        
       -[SCOFFS]                

   Jesus, I don't want          
   to know her fucking name!    

                         [SIGHS]

                    [WHISPERS]  
                    Yeah, right.

REENA:                          
Well, we wanted to talk to you. 

    -We wanted to tell you--    
    -Together.                  

Because we wanted               
to tell you                     

that even though                
you thought                     

your dad was away               
on a long business trip,        

 the truth is that he's actually
 moved out of the house.        

             What?              

       When?                    

Since Mom cracked               
his head open.                  

       Kenny!                   

   -It's gonna be fine, Nate.   
   -[NATE SOBBING QUIETLY]      

          Stop crying.          

    Tell him                    
    it's gonna be fine, Dad.    

    Tell him                    
    you're coming back home.    

     Your father can't          
     tell you that, Joshua,     

because your father             
has found a new woman.          

               [WHISPERING]     
               No, I didn't!    

What are you doing?             
Why are you telling them that?  

       Because it's true.       

Have a new girlfriend?          

                    No, no, I-- 
                    No, I don't.

                     Look, um...

              Your mother and I,
              we just--         

    Just what?                  

     We don't get along anymore,
     not like we used to.       

    You know, like, maybe       
    with your friends in school.

We don't go                     
to an actually school, Dad.     

        But-but you have--      
        You have friends, right?

         You mean               
         realm buddies?         

            Yeah, realm buddies.

       Would you guys every have
       a falling out?           

             You know, like, uh,

                 the guy who's  
                 your best buddy
                 on the realm,  

           but then, you just...

Oh, just what?                  

      [SHARPLY]                 
      You don't connect anymore.

           Not like you used to.

   Look, what your father       
   is trying to say             

is that he would be happier     
living alone                    

with a rubber doll than having  
all of us around him.           

          What the fuck is wrong
          with you?             

Look at your kids, Adam.        

You're about to lose            
your kids.                      

Are they not                    
more important to you           
than some stupid avatar?        

         Do you want me to stay?

               I mean, you don't
               love me anymore--
               it's so obvious  

        that you name the worst.

Can you just                    
get out of here, please?        

        Come here, baby.        

              [¶¶]              

   So then, came the lawyers?   

ADAM [SNIFFS]:                  
Yeah.                           

She told State                  
I was skipping my medication,   

    and she used                
    the rubber doll incident    

   to get a restraining order   
   against me,                  

     which limited my time      
     with the kids              

    to virtual visits only,     

      like I was some kind      
      of fucking pervert        

     who is a risk              
     to their own children.     

         That's heavy.          

             Here.              

                   Have another.

         [POURS LIQUID]         

   So now, you're diagnosed     
   with this heart condition,   

            and you feel        
            like the only way   
            you can die in peace

  is to get your company ahead  
  with some CHIP technology     

so you can save your job        
for your Premium 3 replacement? 

          Pretty much.          

     This may sound strange     

      poor for me, but...       

      I think                   
      we're all connected.      

     Not necessarily            
     in a religious sense.      

               But more in terms
               of some...       

                collective fate.

               Please consider  
               the random nature

                of our creation.

            What if my mom      
            had missed her train

                 the day she met
                 my father?     

     Would somebody else be born
     to create Premium 3,       

          and affect            
          the order of your life

          in the same way       
          that you, say, I have?

      [SIGHS]                   
      Who knows?                

                    I do.       

          You didn't look for me

           to give you          
           some CHIP technology.

I didn't?                       

        You were hoping I'd hear
        your touching story     

                and engineer you
                a new heart.    

            A simple clone organ

        I can build in my garage

        from one hair           
        on the top of your head.

               But... I think...

           there's nothing wrong
           with your heart.     

Really?                         

Because I was lying all along.  
I do feel pain.                 

I feel it all the time,         
right here.                     

  That pain that you're feeling,
  that existential dread,       

         comes from             
         the lack of connection.

                 You're missing 
                 something vital
                 in your life.  

             -What?             
             -Love.             

But why does it seem like       
I'm the only one                

that feels this way?            

    Because you are the only one
    that's still free.          

        Everybody else is hooked
        in Lithium X!           

              Lithium X takes   
              all the pain away,

            but love can't exist
            without pain, Adam. 

So I have to continue           
to suffer?                      

            No, not necessarily.

                    Seems to me,

      you got your heart set    
      on a special virtual girl.

                And now,        
                all of a sudden,

             I know why you came
             to look for me.    

     Even though                
     you couldn't possibly know.

            Adam, just like you,

   I wanted to touch            
   my fantasy in the real world.

              And so I brought  
              my avatar to life,

               using some       
               state resources--

        I should never have used
        for that purpose.       

You created a clone             
out of your virtual lover?      

                [SIGHS]         

      That's why they ousted me.

            And I should've gone
            to jail,            

                 but I purchased
                 my freedom...  

         by giving              
         the right people access

                to all of       
                my CHIP patents,

         and in return,         
         they turned a blind eye

          and they sent me      
          into early retirement.

                      And now...

               I got a guy      
               that's got a guy.

                And if you want,

             if you really want,

         and I believe you do...

                 I can get Maria
                 to come see you
                 in the flesh.  

      Now, isn't that better    
      than some CHIP technology,

                 or else another
                 aching heart?  

              [¶¶]              

             Damn.              

           ADAM:                
           <i> Dial Mom.</i>           

  [DEVICE BEEPS AND WHIRRS ON]  

              Mom?              

   Jesus, what the hell         
   have you done to yourself?   

  I know it's just an avatar,   
  but, I mean, you look 17.     

      And this tank top...      

 You look nice in a disturbing  
 kind of a way.                 

  No, I know you're not dead,   
  but I mean, heh...            

  is this really how you want   
  to experience things now?     

 I get that it was expensive,   
 but what if the kids saw you?  

   I mean,                      
   Kenny might get a hard-on.   

    He thought                  
    you looked nice, did he?    

             Jesus.             

        Yeah, well,             
        it's been tough.        

     You know what I think      
     about Lithium X.           

     It's killing us all,       
     we're all going extinct    

     like expired microbes      
     on a Petri dish.           

      What's a Petri dish?      
      Look it up!               

   Don't worry about me.        
   I'm not worried about me!    

       You don't need           
       to worry about me.       

   I'm worried                  
   about Reena and the kids,    

          but not me.           

   Reena, the kids and Maria,   
   but not me.                  

   Maria is a very nice girl,   

  and maybe I'll introduce you  
  to her sometime,              

 if you ever come out this way. 

   Enough with the medication   
   thing, Mom, all right?!      

      Just enough with it!      

Yeah, but I am special!         
That's what you always told me! 

        I'm scaring you.        

        I'm sorry, Mom.         

       Go back to sleep.        

 I think I just drank too much. 

     Don't worry about me,      
     I'm fine.                  

        I love you, Mom.

              Hey.              

      No, I'm not               
      at the office today.      

 I'm-I'm-I'm a little bit sick. 

   I didn't see the numbers.    

    All VR sectors are down     
    this quarter? Whoa.         

       I-I told you. Heh.       

   No, I can't,                 
   I have a raging headache.    

    Look, I took a very, uh,    

 important meeting last night,  

     and my head is             
     just ready to explode.     

         My medication?         

      Yeah, I'm taking it       
      like clockwork.           

       Can't you hear           
       how happy I sound?       

 Well, maybe                    
 you should pay more attention.

         Can I come in?         

                    Are the kids
                    all right?  

      Yeah. They're fine.       

                    How are you,
                    Adam?       

           You look like a mess.

        Okay, I'm really worried
        about you.              

                        You are?

                   You know,    
                   looking back,

           there's so many times
           that I wish          

        you could just          
        give up on your dreams  

         and live a normal life.

               But now I realize

              that you can exist
              in normalcy.      

            You-you need action.

Excitement.                     
A challenge.                    

                All right, now, 
                I just feel like
                I need a break. 

                  That's all    
                  I really want.

Well, what if I told you        

that that is possible,          
Adam?                           

                That you can get
                that break?     

I don't understand.             

   -Look, your mom called me.   
   -Oh, God.                    

       No, come on, she's sweet.

             Okay, she's worried
             about you.         

You see her new avatar?         
She looks like she's waiting    

for someone                     
to take her to the prom.        

                        [SCOFFS]

           So what,             
           her fantasy is wrong,

        but yours is right, huh?

No, that's--                    
That's not what I meant.        

              Well, Adam,       
              if you really know

             so much better     
             than everyone else,

       shouldn't you be in      
       a better position by now?

           Huh? Shouldn't you be
           more successful?     

              More accomplished?

                Shouldn't you be
                more...         

happy?                          

Listen, the kids,               

surprisingly,                   
they miss their father.         

They've been                    
a little depressed recently.    

And I've been                   
thinking that...                

                        Yeah...?

Look, Jenny's husband           
is this big finance guy.        

He's really successful          
and he has all kinds            
of major connections.           

And he has told me              
that there is a way             

we can unlock Premium 3         

without anyone                  
actually dying for real.        

  -What are you talking about?  
  -Just listen to me            

for one minute, okay?           

It's called                     
Virtual Assassination.          

But it's not as bad             
as it sounds.                   

Essentially, they just cook up  
all this digital paperwork,     

and as far as                   
the State is concerned,         

you are as good as dead.        

They ship your replacement      
in 48 hours.                    

You can save your company.      

You don't even have to worry    
about that anymore, Adam.       

I've-- I made him               
better than you.                

   I made him a better listener,
   I made him calmer.           

         And most of all,       
         I just made him content
         with what he's got.    

And these clones,               
they don't need to take         
their Lithium X, okay?          

They're permanently             
stable.                         

Just-just think about you,      
without all these mood swings.  

Just a calm, cool,              
content Adam Bird.              

                  He can't fail.

What are you talking about?     

      I mean... I mean...       
      what about me?            

            What-what's supposed
            to be left for me?  

        Well, I thought         
        about this too.         

    You can keep this house.    

       We don't need it.        

 I mean, you can refinance it.  

     You don't have             
     that long left anyway,     

     so go to a place           
     that makes you happy.      

    I heard the sun up north    
    isn't that bad.             

     Oh, pick up                
     playing guitar again.      

  Or waste your remaining days  
  with Maria                    

     without feeling guilty     
     about it.                  

I really                        
don't care anymore, Adam.       

Come on, this has to be         
the best solution.              

   Just think about the kids.   

       It doesn't sound like    
       the best solution for me.

                  Don't you see,

          the guy that you      
          once fell in love with

               is that same guy.

     With the mood swings.      

     The guy who sometimes      
     daydreams.                 

                  And has fits  
                  of bad temper!

          It is hard to do well 

          at this thing         
          called life, Reena.   

             It is fucking hard.

    You have to fight through it
    till your last breath,      

        and that's what         
        a real man does.        

 And that's what this guy,      
 who you once fell in love with,

     does each                  
     and every fucking day!     

                Same guy!       
                Who's the father

               of your goddamn  
               fucking children,

                and you just,   
                you wanna, uh...

                  kill him?     

            My God.             

          Look at you.          

 You should have never stopped  
 singing and acting.            

   You're such a drama queen.   

        You think that          
        you're so noble?        

   But all you really are       
   is just a great performer.   

         Underneath             
         this poor act,         

there is nothing                
but a sad                       

and manipulative                
bundle of anxiety.              

You spend your days             
spreading the same technology   

that you are so fearful of.     

Why don't you just man up?      

Put your kids ahead.            

And just be brave,              

for once in your lousy,         
miserable life.                 

                      All right.

                        You win.

           What do I have to do?

There's nothing to do, baby.    

It's already been done.         

       What's already been done?

Well, I notified Tech Broker    
of your accident                

before I came here.             

They actually sounded like      

they've been expecting it.      

              What the fuck     
              did you tell them?

That you overdosed              

on pristine and alcohol.        

            I've never          
            even taken pristine.

Well, Jenny's husband           
suggested Lithium X,            

but I told him                  
no one would buy that.          

Not with your history.          

Anyway, you should know,        
on the realm,                   

you no longer have access       
to your old identity.           

Your passwords                  
have been changed,              

and your death                  
has been reported.              

Jenny's husband has created     
a new identity for you.         

Just log in,                    
it'll guide you through.        

And I've left you               
some money,                     

and the house,                  
of course.                      

     How could you do this      

  without talking to me first?  

   I-I wanted to see the kids   
   one last time.               

And my mom, I only ever talk    
to my mom on the realm.         

          And Maria...          

How can I even log in

Your wife didn't feel           
a thing.                        

You thought she was a cunt.     

      <i> Voilà.</i>                   

In 24 hours,                    
you'll have her back.           

    Version 2.0.                

      I thought it was 48.      


It's progress, man!             

It is...                        
It is all around us.            

So if you...                    

If you guessed right            
on the application,             

then all your problems          
will be gone in no time.        

And nobody's the wiser.         

       You almost               
       make it sound like       

   I planned the whole thing.   

Heh. Did you?                   

                  Yeah.         

       I waited till she crossed
       the street               

          to insult her,        
          knowing that she would

        turn around exactly     
        three feet into the road

       and tell me              
       to fuck off, just as     
       a pristine-induced driver

             went by and crashed
             into her.          

             I'm just that good!

 All right, fair point.         

You don't have to be            
a wise ass now.                 

So are you going                
to the other address?           

Because this one is             
the one listed for delivery.    

             What?              

Her replica                     
is coming here.                 

       Oh, you'll both need     

  to fill out                   
  different return addresses.   

Right there.                    
Maybe one of your parents       

or else                         
a non-nosy neighbor?            

      What, you mean            
      like an emergency address?

In the unfortunate event        

  that your replica does come   
  to replace you,               

  you or your spouse will want  
  to meet said replica          

  prior to bringing them home   
  to the kids.                  

 Well, we have another house... 

            -You do?            
            -Yeah.              

    I mean, Adam's              
    a very hardworking man.     

  Well, that's splendid then.   

 Sir, do you want               
 her replica delivered here--?  

             Yeah.              

        That would be...        

           splendid.            

You sure you don't want me      
to call you a therapist?        

      I can tell you that       
      the last person,          

    clone or avatar that        
    I want to see right now     

    is a goddamn therapist.     

      What I want is to be      
      left alone to mourn       

     for a couple of hours.     

                   is that okay,
                   Officer?     

     What about your kids?      

           They have            
           everything they need.

                 Kenny's 14 now.

           They can survive     
           one night without us.

    You don't think they're     
    gonna be worried sick       
    about their mother?         

                    No, I don't.

                Is that         
                against the law?

Tell you what                   
I'm gonna do.                   

I'm gonna come back             
in a couple days,               

just to check in on you,        
see how you're doing.           

Good night, asshole.            

 What? No, that is my password. 

        No... Fuck you.         

  Fuck you, that-- that is me.  
  That is-- That is me!         

      I have to log in--        
      I have to log in          
      to go and see Maria!      

   I should see a therapist?    

         What the f--?          

Did they give you               
a sense of humor now, because-- 

     Let me tell you,

  Oh, you-- You have            
  a nickname for him already.   

     I have a gift for you.     

        I'm sure you do.        

Let's just take it slowly,      
honey, all right?               

My body's still so sore         

   from all                     
   this operational examination.

    Uh, what                    
    operational examination?    

          With Donnie.          

      He had to test me         
      to see that I work.       

        Test you how...?        

          You know...           

      No, I don't know...       

           My senses.           

        My five senses.

        taste and touch.

                   he raped you.

No. Don't be ridiculous.        

He liberated me.                

He gave me life.                

Why wouldn't I want             
to thank him for it?            

            Well, you could've  
            just said thank you.

Don't be such a prude.          

You're the one who told me      

that I should be able

      Was that me?              

   I look pretty sad            
   in the real world.           

               Not when         
               you put these on.

   In here, you were magical.   

I don't ever want               
to see the realm again.         

  What were you searching for   
  in my bag?                    

          I don't know, I got   
          possessive and jealous

         and I wanted to know   
         what you hide in there.

              I guess           
              I found something.

You're not talking              
about the condoms, I assume?    

           I'm talking about    
           that fat, shiny chip.

That's the gift                 
from Donnie.                    

              I thought         
              you were the gift.

No. This is it.                 

         So what is it?         

It's called                     
Eternal 1.                      

Donald said                     
it's an abandoned program       

that was killed by State        
at its Beta stage.              

It was designed                 
to download the brain           
of the soon to be deceased      

so their relatives              
could meet them later           
in the realm worlds,            

upload that data                
right into their own CHIP.      

You know, like, being able      
to keep another person          

right inside your brain.        

It's pretty neat, right?        

   This one chip...             

   can contain everything       
   I am?                        

               Everything I feel
               and remember?    

Yes, and there will be plenty   
of room to include much more.   

   Adam, even from              
   my limited point of view     

      as a total newcomer       
      to this world,            

I can tell that...              

these are difficult times       
for you people.                 

      You know, when I was      
      on my way over here,      

     I thought about myself     
     transforming               

into flesh and blood,           

and I had                       
this funny question.            

Take you, for example.          

 You were naturally conceived.  

  You're human and you think.   

     You have                   
     consciousness, but...      

    what about the cells        
    that make up your body?     

Are they conscious              
of being part of you?           

   I think they're programmed   
   to scratch an itch,          

and they have no knowledge      
they're part                    

      of this bigger thing      
      called Adam Bird.         

        So... So what is        
        your question?          

       Maybe, just maybe,       

    you're just a cell too,     
    Adam.                       

  Like you think you have       
  this whole meaningful life,   

       but in the end,          
       all you really are       

       is a small cell          
       in God's own body.       

  You would think there's       
  a bigger purpose out there.   

  You're not sure what you're   
  supposed to achieve and why,  

   but you multiply,            
   and fight to survive just,   

      just like cells do.       

        And in the end,         

     after all those cells      
     have died,                 

     this God will die too.     

  But even,                     
  even he is only a small part  

     of another bigger God      

     that controls              
     more than this planet.     

     Look out there, Adam.      

 Look out there and see         
 how many stars are in the sky. 

     It's... It's infinite.     

   You're,                      
   you're just a small cell.    

     And understanding that     

 is what will make you special. 

            Hey, wait a minute, 
            where are you going?

I wanted to meet you            
my whole life                   

in the real world.              

It was my biggest fantasy,      
and you're just leaving?        

        When I was on the realm,

         I was instantly        
         connected to knowledge.

          And I learned about   
          this chemical reaction

            that needs to happen
            for you to feel     

          that you love someone.

                   That's funny.

          It's those            
          same unconscious cells

           deciding for us      
           when we feel in love.

       It's really crazy, right?

Too much for one brain.         

But maybe not enough            
for one CHIP.                   

                 I really       
                 like you, Adam,

           but I don't love you.

                  I want to feel
                  real love.

      [LAUGHS]                  

                What are        
                you laughing at?

Well, what else                 
are you gonna do?               

                Well, uh,       

                do you want     
                to come in?     

        Sure.                   

   [DOOR CLOSES, LOCK BEEPS]    

Do you always                   
walk around naked?              

           No, it's very recent.

                  But I think   
                  I'm liking it,

                I feel free     
                all of a sudden.

  Jesus, is that what           
  you people do on the realm?   

    Heh, is that even legal?    

       That-that was just me,   
       unloading my frustration.

           In-in the real world,
           I mean,              

              nobody            
              actually got hurt.

  Are you gonna shoot her too?  

              I don't know      
              What I'm gonna do.

Well, you should know           
that us replicas                

can only use violence           
in self defense.                

We cannot initiate.             

So, you're not in any sort      
of danger from<i> moi.</i>             

         Still, I feel like     
         I want to hold onto it,

-if it's all the same with you. 
-Sure.                          

You look good with it.          
Very new age.                   

  Naked with a gun.             

Sounds like a rock album.       

         -Do you mind?          
         -No, go ahead.         

It's just,                      
whenever I see a guitar,        

  I feel the need               
  to pick it up.                

       What do you mean,        
       "whenever"?              

     You were just created      
     today, no?                 

Yeah, but I have memories.      

Aren't they                     
your memories too?              

You know, I had this song       
playing in my head              

the whole way over here.

          How did...?           

     I was never                
     that good a musician.      

            Really?             

 All my fondest memories        
 are of music and performance.  

     I assumed you were         
     in the arts yourself.      

      -Are you not?             
      -I'm in technology.       
      I'm a broker.             

 Well, every good broker needs  
 to be a bit of a good actor.   

So you're a bullshit artist.    

       Still art.               

                 So she made you
                 creative?      

           Who would've thought?

        I always figured she was
        the materialistic kind. 

           I guess              
           I underestimated her.

You bet your ass                
you underestimated her.         

Reena is great.                 

But you're so incapable         
of being satisfied,             

you could never see it.         

        [GLASSES CLINK]         

                What else       
                did she ask for?

               Did you come with
               a six-pack too?  

       I-- I think I look       
       just like you.           

            [SIGHS]             

    I-I don't believe this.     

             No, she had to ask 
             for something else.

             She-she's no better
             than me.           

    There-there has to be       
    a shallow touch to all this.

   Would you like me to take    
   all my clothes off?          

                 Yeah, actually.

              If you don't mind.

                 So far so good.

         Well, at least         
         she liked my underwear.

              Oh, fuck her.     

             Come on! Really?   

That's a very small             
difference.                     

      Trust me, that is anything
      but a small difference.   

               That right there,
               is saying more   

               than you can     
               possibly imagine.

So, what now?                   

    I mean, how come            
    you're here, and she's dead?

Well, that's, that's            
a very long story.              

                    I have time.

       Okay. Well, first,       

    my wife caught me           
    having a virtual affair.    

Then she wanted me replaced,    

but when I wanted               
to stick around a little longer,

she ordered                     
my virtual assassination.       

She killed me off on the realm! 
And-and left me this house!     

 I guess she forgot that        
 you would be coming here first 

       and she certainly        
       did not expect           

to get hit by a car.            

 And all of this, all of this,  
 this fucking warped reality    

is because of                   
that Donald fucking Stein.      

Heh, can you believe that?      

  How one person                
  can set something in motion   

   and the rest of the world    
   is never the same again!     

[DRY CHUCKLE]                   

       I feel like              
       getting in my car,       

    and going down              
    to that retirement home     

     and finding                
     that motherfucker who,     

who defiled my fantasy,         

who-who made it possible        
for my wife to make             
a better version of me.         

I feel like going down there    
and ending him!                 

What do you think               
about that?!                    

           I think it reminds me

               of our favorite  
               high school play.

             What?              

           What play?           

             You don't remember?

              You must remember!

              We were promising.

I have no idea                  
what you're talking about.      

          Sure you do.          

Repeat after me.                

I promise, it'll                
all come back to you.           

To be, or not to be.            

That is the question.           

Whether it is nobler            
in the mind...                  

[BOTH RECITING]                 
to suffer the slings and arrows 

of outrageous fortune.          

                But to take arms
                against the sea 
                of troubles.    

Yes, you remember!              

                And by opposing,
                end them.       

Go on!                          

               To die, to sleep.

             To sleep,          
             perchance to dream!

I, there is the rub.            

               For in that sleep
               of death,        

           what dreams may come.

When we have shuffled off       
this mortal coil...             

             Must give us pause.

There's a respect               
that makes calamity             

of so long life.                

              For who would bear

            the whips and scorns
            of time.            

The oppressor's wrong,          
the proud man's contumely...    

               The pangs        
               of despised love,

      the law's delay,          
      the insolence of office...

The spurns that patient merit   
of the unworthy takes...        

         When he himself        
         might his quietus make,

             with a bare bodkin?

Who would fardels bare,         

to grunt and sweat              
under a weary life...           

     But that the dread         
     of something after death...

The undiscovered country!       

          For whose bourn       
          no traveler returns...

Puzzles the will!               

       And makes us rather bare,

           those ills we have...

       BOTH:                    
       Than fly to others       

     that we know not of...     

    Thus conscience does        
    make cowards of us all,     

    And thus the native hue     
    of resolution               

   Is sicklied o'er with        
   the pale cast of thought,    

   And enterprises              
   of great pitch and moment    

    With this regard            
    their currents turn awry    

  And lose the name of action.  

         Soft you now,

      [SOUND OF APPLAUSE]       

        ADAM REPLICA: Adam Bird,
        ladies and gentlemen.   

         To Adam Bird.          

              I'm not Adam Bird.

           You're Adam Bird now.
           I'm...               

                Richard Burbage.

What did she call you?          

                Richard Burbage.

That's hysterical.              

              Why?              

          -Look it up.          
          -No.                  

         Because I'd have log in
         as Richard Burbage     

        to look up              
        Richard Burbage,        

    and I won't do it           
    because that's not who I am!

                       Or is it?

            Maybe that is me.   
            Maybe I'm just a guy

             who secretly wishes
             he was Adam Bird.  

                 But that's you.

        You are everything that 
        I would ever wish to be.

       And Reena somehow        
       figured that out,        

      and she, she knew         
      what I wanted to be       

            better than I did...

There's no shame                
in admitting                    

that Reena's version            
of Adam Bird                    

is a much better one.           

It's holistic,                  
and less egotistical.           

It's a version much more geared 
to please other people.         

Why don't you just embrace      
your new identity, Richard?     

               I-I don't know...

                 I don't think  
                 I can carry on,

       knowing there's a replica
       of me out there.         

          It just,              
          it doesn't seem right.

             There should be    
             only one Adam Bird.

              But you said it   
              yourself, Richard.

You're no longer                
Adam Bird.                      

You're Richard Burbage.         

               I don't know     
               who I am anymore.

       I don't even know        
       what I am!               

            I was told I can fit
            inside a CHIP.      

        Everything I am         
        and ever was            

      can fit inside            
      one tiny microchip.       

  And there'll still be plenty  
  of room left for more.        

     What does it all mean?     

    It means you can live on    
    for eternity.               

   This whole flesh and blood   
   business-- it's near done.   

Even us clones,                 

we're just like BluRays         
to your VHS tapes...            

   Some transitional upgrade    
   that will doubtless          

                    be obsolete 
                    in due time.

      In the end,               
      we're all gonna go virtual

and exist                       
in some cloud of neurons.       

            [GASPS]             

       Only the sand            
       will be left here.       

      Sand and silicon...       

    All the rest will be        
    out there on the realm,     

 and each of us will be         
 their own special virtual god. 

    But I was                   
    virtually assassinated.     

   I can only exist virtually   

      as Richard Burbage.       

      That is                   
      if I let you live...      

   I bet I can                  
   find a way to reverse this   

       if I stick around        
       a little longer.         

      Wait, wait, wait...       

Why did your wife order         
a virtual assassination?        

   You never told me.           

           I'm dying.           

        My heart,               
        it's just not as certain

        it wants to keep beating
        any longer.             

             I need a new heart.

Do you know what I think?       

I think                         
you've been skipping            

your medication                 
for months now.                 

You owe back                    
on all these pills...           

You should take 'em.            

You should                      
take these pills                

and balance yourself out        
so you can think straight       

and find                        
the right solution here.        

    Think about your kids...    

You have to be strong           
for them.                       

You have                        
to sacrifice yourself...        

No.                             

You're just trying              
to kill me.                     

        You're trying to kill me
        and take my place.      
        Isn't that right?!

        is gonna happen?!       

     Because I have             
     a different ending in mind.

   -[ADAM GRUNTS]               
   -I can't let you kill me.    

I'm programmed with             
a self defense mechanism.       

       We just call it survival!

                         Fuck.

              [¶¶]              

       [DOORBELL CHIMES]        

Oh, my God.                     

         I missed you.          

         I missed you too, baby.

Did you?                        

           -What?               
           -Nothing.            

I-I just                        
remember those differently.     

     -[LAUGHS]                  
     -Are you disappointed?     

Just surprised.                 

In a good way.                  

        Well, good. Heh.        

   [DOOR CLOSES, LOCK BEEPS]    

We should get back              
to the house.                   

The kids are there.             
I miss them.                    

                         Really?

          I don't remember you  
          being the homely type.

I've changed.                   

I'm a better man now.           

Oh, boy,                        
you sure are...                 

                I guess we're   
                both better now.

Oh, my God, I don't think       
I've ever felt this good.       

And-and I don't think           
that I have ever                

loved you more than I do        
right now.                      

                         Me too.

          [GASPS]               
          Oh, my God.           

Premium 3 is gonna              
save the world.                 

          Yeah. If only we can  
          just replace everyone.

Well, it's not                  
such a bad idea.                

 -We could start with the kids. 
 -Yeah, right?                  

            Feed 'em an overdose
            of Lithium X,       

                   get 'em back 
                   just perfect.

Well, I mean...                 

I guess Kenny could use         
a bit more compassion.          

And Joshua is                   
a touch too sensitive.          

What about Nate?                

        If we think hard enough,

           I'm sure             
           we can find something

          to improve in him too.

We can be the first family      
of clones.                      

                            Yes.

                    We will win.

Well, until something else      
comes along.
