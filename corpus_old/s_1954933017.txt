 Announcer:
<i> And now for the news.</i>

<i> Three more abandoned vehicles</i>
<i> have been found in</i>

<i> the Pine Barrens region of</i>
<i>Bristol County this past month.</i>

<i> Locals are saying</i>
<i> Ash Pine Road has become</i>

<i> the new Bermuda Triangle</i>
<i> with 31 cars and/or drivers</i>

<i> going missing over</i>
<i> the past 20 years.</i>

<i> Seems the Golden Gears</i>
<i> car races have created</i>

<i> a few more monsters to</i>
<i> watch out for on the road...</i>

              Man:
         <i> Don't worry.</i>
       <i> I'm a paramedic.</i>

<i> ...Automobile accidents</i>
<i> involving teen drivers</i>
<i> have just gone up</i>

<i> 29% in Bristol County over</i>
<i> the past three years.</i>

  <i> Â¶ Given the need to know Â¶</i>

  <i> Â¶ And who would've known Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ Take it away Â¶</i>

Woman: Don't feel bad.
I'm a bad driver.

         Oh, fuck that.

    I won Junior Gold Gears
    two years running.

( giggles )

       Oh, yeah,
       you're funny, huh?

         No. It just sounds like
         a terrible experience.

               It must have been
               really scary.

    You wanna see something
    really scary?

        Um, what is it?

                 Ah, it's better
                 if I show you.

( screams )

        ( revs engine )

Asshole!

That was really scary!

               Well, I told you.

   You could have killed us.

          You'll be fine.
          We do it all the time.

         That's funny.

       Rachel couldn't
       handle it either.

Okay.

              Let's make it fun.

           Please don't kill me.

             I'm never even
             been to California.

( tires squealing )

              ( car horn honks )

          ( crashing )

            Jordan?

       Oh, shit, Jordan!

        ( phone rings )

             Woman:
 <i> 9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

     Hello? We've been in
     a really bad accident.

       Please send help.

    We're on Ash Pine Road.

        ( siren wails )

           Thank God.

        He hasn't moved.

He's trapped.
Please hurry.

Hello?

Can you get him
out of there?

Is he gonna be okay?

Jordan?

( squeals )

                Don't worry.
                I'm a paramedic.

Worry about what?

( screams )

            Help me!

Amy?

             Yeah?

Could you grab
the mail, baby?

Department said that Daddy's
last check was finally sent.

        Yeah, I got it.

It's only been
eight months.

       You working today?

No.

Bill Higgins is supposed
to pop by

with a tomato plant.

             Great.

I have those same boxers.

Thank you, Rachel.

Got new movies.

         God, I love your mouth.

           Let's go.

        Nice underwear.
        Real sexy.

( laughs )

Later, flapjacks.

                  Hey, Jason.
                  Nice day, huh?

         Oh, what's on your lip?
         It's a huge whore.

Did I hear you talking
to somebody out there?

                             No.

               Here's your mail.

        Thank you, baby.

I thought maybe
it was Angel.

         Yeah. I don't think so.

What happened?

            Nothing.

      She's too busy with
      her new friends.

   I have too much going on,
   though, anyway.

Yes, you do.

Have to get your essay
in their hands by the 15th.

           ( sighs )

My ticket out of
this town, thank God.

   Hey, Mom, do you think dad
   would have loved you

if you were like deformed

      or had flapjacks
      or something?

             What?

I don't know.
Never mind.

             What would make you
             ask that, sweetie?

Nothing, nothing.
Just drop it.

          Of course, your father
          would have.

                         He did.

        That's why he married me

              and not that bimbo
              Judy DeZulla.

Okay, Mom, we can't all be
as beautiful as you are.

        Honey, I'm sure whatever
        is going on with you and
        Angel is just a phase.

What's his sudden interest
in you anyway?

I mean, he only likes
skanks like Brooke.

               Well, I guess
               I'm a skank then.

            Because he likes me.
            And I like him.

      Brad?

I mean, come on.

He's such an asshole
'roid head.

               Amy, he's not!
               He's really nice.

          If you would just give
          him a chance...

No, thanks.

I'd rather die than hang out
with those douchebags.

             Everything's always
             about you.

              Why can't you just
              be happy for me?

                            Amy?

What?

Just drop it.

          ( screaming )

           ( laughs )

     - ( tires screeching )
     - ( screaming )

     Such a YouTube queen.

 I guess she is used to having
 her legs open, isn't she?

         Unbelievable.

              Whoo!

          ( shouting )

      - I wanna do it.
      - You wanna do what?

         I wanna ride the space.

            - Yeah?
            - Yeah.

Okay.

      My baby's gonna
      ride the space! Whoo!

          Woo-hoo-hoo!

          Wait. What.?

         Check it out!
         Whoo-hoo!

        - I'm doing it!
        - Whoo!

                            Man!

             Stop.

                           Babe?

    - Come on, baby.
    - Look, stop! Seriously!

      Brooke, I'm driving!

             Guys?

       Easy, easy!

         Angel, Angel!

           Oh, shit!

No, no, no, no!

      No, no, no, no, no,
      no, no, no.

    No, no, no, no, no, no.

   You're okay, you're okay.

<i> 9-1-1.</i>

There's been an accident.

           ( crying )

We're gonna be in
so much trouble!

         Don't worry.
         We'll be fine.

             We? What about her?

                           Shit.

      ( ambulance siren )

About fucking time.

    - Tim, come on, man!
    - What are we gonna say?

What the fuck
are you doing?

        Let's just say she fell.

How'd the fuck would she
fall out of a moving car?

         I don't know!

     She was always just
     goofing off like that.

So she climbed out
without anyone noticing?

And just fell?

                        I swear.

     - Dude, what happened?
     - It was an accident.

You! You!

          ( yelling )

       It wasn't anyone's fault.
       It was an accident!

Cut the crap.

Breathe! Relax!

     What took you guys so
     long to get here?

We got one ambulance
covering 300 square miles.

Do the math.

              Amy:
 In the past couple of months,

 Angel and I had grown apart.

    not because we didn't
    want to see each other.

  But because she wanted
  to try new things and grow.

Your hair looks so good.

             I know, right?

     The guy who does hair
     in Top Model did it.

He's really good.

                 Unreal.

  I'll remember her for
  the free spirit that she was

and how she taught me
the meaning of friendship.

        - Shut up!
        - It's awesome.

             It's a funeral,
             not a fashion show.

I love you, Angel.

I'm gonna miss you so much.

( giggles )

You're so bad.

That was beautiful.

All right now. I'm going
to get you out of here.

But first, a few words about
automobile safety

from Sergeant Higgins.

          I feel sick.

  That's because you're drinking
  at 10:30 in the morning.

                        Shut up!

Thank you,
Principal Stockton.

   Obviously, not my
   favorite part of the job.

      Statistics show
      that vehicle crashes

   are the number one cause
   of death in this country.

   So I know you're out
   there having a good time.

      And you're texting.
      And you're jamming.

       And you're rockin'
       out to the radio.

        But let me tell
        you something,

    by the time I get there,
    the fun is over

       and what I see is
       not so pretty.

    So could you please just
    keep in mind, please,

       that a car is not

             a toy.

Hey, good job in there.

It was really nice.

I'm sorry.

                         Thanks.

Hey, Mary.

Hey, Amy.

I just wanted to personally
give you my condolences.

Those kids friends
of yours too?

                  Not at all.

That's good because I think
Angel would have fared

a little bit better if
she hadn't been friends
with them either.

 Do you suspect that there
 is more to their story than...

Following up on
a couple of things.

We're gonna go.

             Right.

        - See you soon.
        - Yeah.

Oh, and, Amy, you need
anything, don't hesitate
to call day or night, okay?

I always promised your
father I'd watch after you.

He would have done
the same for me.

                 Well, I'm fine.

Okay.

           ( crying )

      <i> Â¶ Keep me inside Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ See you in time Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ Wait by my side Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ Wait for sunshine Â¶</i>

  <i> Â¶ 'Cause it won't take long</i>

 <i> Â¶ If you take it day by day,</i>
 <i> yeah, you take it slow... Â¶</i>

                    God damn it!

           Why does nothing work
           in this office?

What's the problem?

                   Stupid mouse.

            The mouse is stupid.

 Listen, by the way,
 there's this kid, Jordan Banks.

            He went away
            for the weekend

             and didn't check in
             with his mommy yet.

Big surprise there.

  His mom's been up my dick hole
  like a goddamned kangaroo.

Sounds painful.

             It is.

      I just don't get guys.
      I think they're all jerks.

         Some are, kid.

          ( chuckles )

Not all of them.

         You got home late again
         last night.

Mm-hmm.

      You and your new boyfriend
      must be having quite
      the time together.

Archie's not
my boyfriend.

But thank you for asking.

          So do we have step dad
          material here or what?

What are you doing?

          I'm sorry. I'm just...

                     I miss Dad.

I know.

Me too.

And now with Angel,

I can't imagine.

    You know what I was thinking
    about the other day?

What?

              Do you remember
              the July 4th Fair?

Of course.

        - The fireworks?
        - The fireworks.

          ( laughing )

              They were so low
              and I was so lost.

Daddy jumped on you
like you were on fire.

            I just don't get
            what he sees in her.

Who?

                          Jason.

               Okay, if you like
               him so much,

              why don't you just
              ask him to chill?

Chill, Mom?

        What? I can't say chill?

No, you can.

It's just...

I just, um, I wanted
to run something by you.

      - Okay.
      - ( doorbell rings )

              Hold that thought.

I think I want a boob job.

          A boob job?

I thought you were doing so
well with your jazzercise tapes.

It's cardio kickboxing, Mom.
And it's not enough.

      But, baby, you're so
      beautiful the way you are.

Can't we at least
talk to Dr. Monroe?

           We'll talk about this
           in a bit, okay?

       ( doorbell rings )

             Phil?

Hi. Come on in.

                         Thanks.

What brings you by?

    Well, actually, I wanted
    to talk to Amy.

             So what do you know
             about Jordan Banks?

That he's
a walking STD?

              Amy!

                    ( chuckles )
                    All right.

     Any idea where he might be?

    No, not a clue.

        Why do you ask?

     Well, his folks filed
     a missing persons.

      And I didn't know if there
      was any word on the street
      as to his whereabouts.

                Hopefully, well,

      hopefully, there's nothing
      to be concerned about.

We are hardly concerned.

        Amy, what has
        gotten into you?

I can't stop
thinking about Angel.

          Well, stop.

What if somebody
finds out?

We could be in deep shit.

  Oh, the dead don't speak, J.

          Let it die.
          They did.

How do you sleep at night?

             Naked.

What is wrong with you?

    What's wrong with me is
    that you're acting like
    a little bitch.

        Brooke, this is serious.

    I'm sure your little friend,
    Amy, would love to know
    how serious it is.

                Are you kidding?

               You can't
               just threaten me.

            Oh, no?

It's not your place
to tell her anything.

      I can do whatever
      I want to do, okay?

I'm laying here being
all hot and stuff.

And you're over there whining
about all this bullshit!

    No, Brooke. I'm just sick
    of playing this game.

          ( sighs )
          I gotta go.

         I'm gonna have to touch
         myself since you can't
         seem to handle it.

      - You're the Devil.
      - Bye, little bitch!

Is that what
you're gonna wear?

              No.

Maybe just something you just
slip easily on and off, yeah?

 <i> Â¶ This love was never easy Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ But something's faded</i>
    <i> inside of your heart Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ So you're crusading</i>
     <i> to tear us apart. Â¶</i>

Amy, you look to be a
perfect candidate for
breast augmentation.

             Great.

          Thank you, Dr. Monroe.

Now, Mary, you know
you can call me Dennis.

                      Of course.

You can call me
anything you want.

Just don't call me
late for supper.

( chuckles )

So how soon can we schedule?

Oh, let me see.

Looks like I have a
cancellation on the 15th.

Does that work?

                       That's...

       Yes, I'll take it.

                           Soon.

  <i> Â¶ We become everything Â¶</i>

Your hair looks awesome.

       Thanks. Didn't want it to
       be too obvious.

God, no,
it's totally subtle.

What's Jason wearing
to the party?

       Oh, if I even invite him.

Really?

I guess Jordan's not
gonna be there either.

Now that he's missing.

          ( chuckles )

      Ugh, guys are so annoying.

So are their mothers.

She will not stop
calling me.

              Zip it up, chatty.

I am.

I think it's about time
that I hang out with Brad.

I think he's perfection.

               He's kind of gay.

He's not gay.
It was a rumor.

         I started it.

Oh!

He's not gay.

        I'm sure you would know.

Not yet.

             Skank.

          How are you?

                       I'm okay.

              Man:
       What's up, Jason?

                So are you going
                to Brooke's?

Yeah. Something
I gotta take care of.

                       Is there?

Only one way to find out.

Come with me.

Come on.

       <i> Â¶ Feel the strain,</i>
       <i> feel the pain Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ But I'll be okay,</i>
      <i> I'll be safe Â¶</i>

    Â¶ I'm flyin' away
    from a state of decay Â¶

         Â¶ What a mess
         My princess Â¶

      Â¶ Everything we made
      eroded away Â¶

  Â¶ You say had enough,
  you say we're out of love Â¶

    Â¶ But this is something
    that we both thought
    we could rise above Â¶

  Â¶ You say you're missing me
  We're both in agony Â¶

  Â¶ Or is it just the thought
  of someone else having me Â¶

         Have you heard
         from Jordan?

        His mom will not
        stop calling me.

                Yeah, same here.

 I thought she wanted to hook up
 with some of that young meat.

                            Hey!

     I think he took that chick,
     Sam, to the Golden Gears
     Muscle Car Extravaganza!

Wait? That little jailbait slut
from the pizza place?

   - Yeah.
   - She's like 15 years old.

                Oh, but have you
                seen that ass?

      Gross, Spaz, gross.

Excuse me?
She's a nobody.

        She's a nobody.

Ow, why do you
keep doing that?

              See?

       It'll be fine, I promise.

                Let me go get us
                some drinks.

Hey, Red Riding Hood.
You lost?

     I think I'm gonna go.

     - You guys talking
       about me over here?
     - No.

       Oh, this should be
       a train wreck.

            Then maybe you were
            talking about Angel.

             And her "accident".

      - Brooke...
      - Oh, that's right.

               The loser sisters
               were friends.

Yeah. Let's go.

Hey, where you going?

  Yeah, well, not here.
  Later, J.

 What do you mean, "accident"?

    Don't put your fingers
    where they don't belong.

     - You might lose them.
     - What?

Brooke, stop!
You're drunk!

The bitch thing is getting
kind of old, all right?

       It's not the 80s anymore.

    Go drive your scooter
    into a tree and film it!

     Nobody would care,
     especially not Rachel!

     And you, Mr. Innocent.

            Don't act like Angel
            was your first.

     What?

  Tell me you and Jordan didn't
  leave that little old lady
  for dead in the woods.

          ( screams )

Oh, shit!

          Oh, my God!

         What'll we do?

            I'm getting
            the hell outta here.

We have to wait
for the police!

        - Fuck that!
        - We can't just
        leave her here!

 You wanna do five to ten for
 manslaughter, be my guest, pal!

      - Not me!
      - He's right, Jason.

                Look, she's old.

                She probably had
                a good life.

            We can't go to jail!
            Come on, let's go!

Shit!

                     Is it true?

              Baby, you better
              believe it's true.

      He's a real piece of shit.
      Just like the rest of us.

      I can't believe it.

      Why? 'Cause you loved him?

           ( crying )

Hey.

Fuck, Brooke!

            - What?
            - What?

You're gonna get us all
arrested for starters!

What is wrong with you?

                        Anyways.

Brad, it's Tim.

Brooke has lost
her shit, okay?

She's just spewing words
in front of everybody.

Chaos. Call me back.

( cell phone rings )

Are you gonna get that?

                 Just ignore it.

                    You want me?

You know I do.

              You think I'm hot?

Yeah.

                Tell me I'm hot.

You're so fucking hot.

        Am I hotter than Brooke?

Yeah, you're so hot.

         Yeah, but tell me
         I'm hotter than Brooke.

You're hotter than Brooke.

             Yeah?

                  ( clattering )

             Wait!

         What was that?

I don't hear anything.

        Brad, seriously.

What?

           Just look.

I'm looking.

Yeah, I don't
see anything.

Babe, don't worry.

I'll protect you.

She shouldn't have been
running her mouth where
she doesn't belong.

How dare you bring
her here, by the way!

                     She's nice!

    Maybe you'd realize that if
    you could get over yourself!

               No wonder your
               parents hate you.

Get the fuck out
of my house!

And don't come back till
you're ready to treat me

the way I deserve
to be treated!

      I do treat you the way
      you deserve to be treated.

                 It's so fucking
                 hot in here.

            I'm ready to go now.

Okay.

Oh, fuck.

          ( chuckles )

                     ( screams )

            Rachel?

            Rachel?
            Rachel!

          ( yelling )

         - Bitch!
         - ( whirring )

            Rachel!

      Guys?

             Guys?

           Oh, shit.

            Rachel?

             Brad?

             Brad?

( clattering )

            Rachel?

Rachel?

          ( exhaling )

         Damn it, boys.

      What have you gotten
      yourselves into now?

           ( crying )

    I told you not to go messing
    around out there, didn't I?

Please don't!

It's not even that bad!

( crying )

                        Shut up.

     ( muffled screaming )

  You're an animal!

                     Mama's boy.

           ( crying )

     ( gasps ) Oh, my God!

             Shit!

          ( screams )

   - Man:<i> Dispatch for 113. </i>
   - Man #2:<i> Go for 113.</i>

<i> Abandoned vehicle found</i>
<i> on Ash Pine Road by</i>
<i> the scrap yard.</i>

               <i> Yeah. On my way.</i>

          ( banging )

         What's all the banging?
         We're fuckin' closed!

I wanna take a look around.

Got a call about
a missing car

and some missing kids.
You seen anything?

       Once they're behind
       this gate, it's too late.

        For the wrecks, that is.

Yeah, yeah.
Just open up.

              Yes, sir, Officer.

                     Come on in.

       Have any visitors
       last night?

                           Nope.

Pretty early to be
working, isn't it?

          Cars ain't gonna crush
          themselves.

No. No, I guess
they wouldn't.

Place fuckin' stinks.

                Cesspool's full.

You run an ambulance
service out of here?

        The old man was.

       Medic in the war.

             Guess he missed
             the smell of blood.

Yeah, yeah,
what's not to miss?

      What have you done?

I'm a paramedic.

        Not anymore, you're not.

                  We about done
                  here, Officer?

             Yeah.

       Yeah, I think so.

                    ( scraping )

What was that?

           Raccoons.

You know,
we got loads of 'em.

             Jesus!

    You got anybody lurking
    around back there?

             Nah, just me
             and little brother.

                No one here
                but us chickens.

                    ( chuckles )

Isn't that right,
you big dummy?

Let's see the chicken dance.
Come on.

                        Come on.

( laughs )

                   Come on!
                   Let's see it!

         You big fuckin' retard!

           ( laughs )

             Okay. Okay, fellas.

             All right, hold up.

             Let's fix that face
             of yours.

              Bite down on this.

          ( screams )

           Now I'm gonna fix
           those teeth of yours.

                Don't worry.
                I'm a paramedic.

          ( screams )

         <i> Don't worry.</i>
       <i> I'm a paramedic.</i>
       <i> I'm a paramedic.</i>

            Honey, remember what
            the doctor said.

        No food or drink for
        24 hours before surgery.

      Mom, I know,
      but my throat is so dry.

         Just one sip.

                            One.

             God, it's horrible,
             isn't it?

Well, they probably got
what they deserved.

                All righty then.

   Well, tomorrow's the big day.

                    You excited?

Yeah, I guess so.

But I had the worst
nightmare about it last night.

     Honey, if you don't feel
     like going through with it,
     we can always reschedule.

No, I'm ready.

I'm ready.

       I'm a paramedic.

       Give me my phone.

Shh!

         I need to call
         my parents.

Don't worry.
We'll kill your parents.

We'll call your parents.

             they're still sore.

      Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.

           ( laughs )

        ( phone rings )

It's for you.

                  Hello?

        Jason:<i> Hi. Amy?</i>

                      Hi, Jason.

       <i> Just wanted</i>
       <i> to say what's up.</i>

    You haven't been online
    in a while

     and I haven't seen you
     since Brooke's house.

                       Oh, yeah.

              I'm kind of over
              social networking.

               And being social.

                  <i> So what's up?</i>

            <i> Hanging out with</i>
            <i> your loser friends?</i>

All right, before you
say anything else.

I really want
to say I'm sorry.

                  No, it's okay.
                  Me, too.

I should have been able
to think for myself

and not listen to those guys.

 I mean, I shouldn't have judged
 you for having awful friends.

( chuckles )
Yeah, they're awful.

           So how did it go with
           Brooke after I left?

Who now?

Wow, that dress never
loved me

the way it's loving you
right now.

           Thank you.

( chuckles )

                So what time are
                you heading out?

He should be here
in a few minutes.

What?

                   I don't know.

         Don't you think Higgins
         tries too hard?

Be nice.
He's sweet.

                  Well, he does.

         Like get over yourself,
         Dirty Harry.

I'm sorry, but not everybody
can fit into your ideal
mold of cool, Amy.

     Well, all I know is that if
     I could do it, anyone can.

          Before, I had nothing.

      And now I have a
      super cute boyfriend
      who drives an amazing car.

And you didn't remember to
send in your essay, did you?

              No.

Well, I guess some things
are just more important
to different people.

              Why can't you just
              be happy for me?

I am, but I need you to be
able to deal with the fact

that I'm friends
with other men.

      ( knocking on door )

Speak of the devil.

Come on in.

There's somebody
I want you to meet.

So, Amy, this is Darryl.

Darryl, this is my daughter,

Amy, who I've been
telling you so much about.

Hey.

So, where'd you guys meet?

( voice fades )

Mom, what's wrong with him?

              Amy!

      You look awfully familiar.

( car honks )

That's Jason.
I'll see you later.

                        Mom?

              Mom!

Darryl: Jon Roy!

           ( crying )

    <i> ( music over dialogue )</i>

Darryl, where did you go?

      Come on. There's something
      I want to show you.

      So what schools are
      you looking at?

     Um, I was actually thinking
     I was taking a year off.

            Really?

                     Yeah.

                  Yeah, fuck it.

 I mean, I don't want to be tied
 down to school and schedules

          and professors
          telling me what to do.

           You know, I just want
           to drink beer.

          ( chuckles )

            - Whoa!
            - Shit!

     God, these shoes were $300.

           You'd think that
           I could walk in them.

                           What?

Where is Amy?
Is she in there?

                       I'm here.

                I'm just better.

I thought you were
better before.

I mean, you're beautiful.

                       But?

But you're acting
like an ass.

                  What? I mean..

             I thought that this
             is what you wanted.

You thought I cared
how much your shoes cost?

     Okay, I guess I was
     just trying to impress you.

All right. Maybe just
don't try so hard.

And besides,
I'm a sneaker guy.

Come on. Let's go get
you that beer.

Man:
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

Hey, that search warrant
you requested was denied.

                         Really?

Guess the judge
thought better of it.

           We'll see about that.

              Man: You piece
              of shit! Fuck you!

     What's going on here?

    I don't know.
    Hope everything's okay.

                 You big retard!

What is going on in there?

         ( screaming )

        ( Amy shrieks )

         ( screaming )

             Jason!

              Run!

      Hey, let's play
      where's Amy's mommy!

   Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

   Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

          ( tapping )

              Amy?

Nobody's gonna help you, Amy.

Bunch of self-entitled maggots!

No common decency!

       No consideration!

You killed my mother,
you fuckin' bitch!

Look, I just wanna talk.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

You don't have to hide.

Gotta learn respect!

Back in my day, we had manners!

           ( grunts )

              Mom?

              No!

           ( crying )

              Mom.

              Mom.

          ( screams )

          ( shouting )

           Start working on
           those fuckin' floors!

             Why don't you do
            some fuckin' dishes?

               Shut the fuck up!

        All you do is sit around

       and praise fuckin' Jesus!

          ( continues shouting )

              You piece of shit!

                       Fuck you!
                       Fuck you!

        Don't hurt him.

 He was only tryin' to help me.

Wait'll I get my goddamn
