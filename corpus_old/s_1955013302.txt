[ Bicycle Bell Rings ]

[ Bicycle Bell Tinkles ]

Have you ever seen
anything like this,
Frank?

Not in my 23 years
on the force.

What do you think?

Oh, it's your standard
trigger bomb.

You can get everything you need
at your local five and dime.

Sugar alcohol,
saltpeter, gunpowder.

Tie it all up
into a neat
little package.

A trigger bomb?
Yeah, it's nothing fancy.

Twine around the outside...

Tied to a vial
of battery acid
on the inside.

Then,
once it's been triggered,

Depending on how well
it's been constructed,

You've got either...
a couple of seconds or half
a minute before she blows.

Unless, of course,
you can find some way
to dilute the acid.

How do you do that?

Oh, just drop it into
the bucket of water...

You happen
to be carrying with you.

You learn all that
at the Bureau?

Oh, there was no Bureau
when I learned this.
Secret Service.

He's not saying much.
He's scared out of his mind.

What's his name?
Ramo.

Ramo, I'm Mr. Flynn.

You're not in trouble, son.

We just want to catch
the people who did this.

We need you to show us the house
where you got the package.

Can you take us there?

[ Phone Rings ]

Bureau of Investigation.

I'm sure the Washington office
is gonna have an opinion
about this.

Hold off
on that report.
Yes?

No need to ruffle
any feathers just yet.

[ Scoffs ]
A package bomb.

I know what it is.
I'm just hoping it's
an isolated incident.

You can't really think that.
Well, at the moment it is.

We don't need a bunch
of the boys from Washington
up here gummin' up the works.

One moment. That was
a reporter on the phone.

He wanted to talk to you
about the boy who was killed.

Is it true?
Yes, Mattie,
I'm afraid it is.

Will you see what else
you can find out about
Frederic Howe?

What do you want to know?
Ah, the usual.

You know, friends, family,
any organizations
he might belong to.

Clubs, charities,
where he spends
his money.

His hat size,
name of his dog,
that sort of thing.

[ Bell Jingles ]

How are you today,
Mr. Flynn?

Well, some days are
better than others.

But I'm all right,
Firmino. Thanks.
How's yourself?

Hey. The sun is shining.
Life is good.

You want the usual?
I'm afraid so.
You've spoiled me.

[ Chuckles ]

Hey, Pop, can I go now?
Santino.

Hey, Mr. Flynn.
Is the storeroom clean?

Yeah, Pop, it's clean.
Don't worry.

All right.
Go. Go, go, go, go.

They rush everywhere, huh?
But where?

Where do they go?

And look, he forget.
[ Sighs ]

Mr. Flynn, would you mind
dropping this off
at Mrs. Cafiero's for us?

Oh, of course.
I'd be glad to.

Here's a nice pair.
What do you think?

Buongiorno.

Come on in.

Buongiorno.
Ciao, signore.

That's mine.

You shut up.
You're a cheater.

Conchetta?

William?

Hi.
You forgot.

Oh, I did.
Grazie.

Rough day?
Uh, yeah.

A boy was killed today.

He boosted a package
from someone's front stoop,
and it... exploded.

Oh, my God.
[ Footsteps On Stairs ]

Hi, Tony.

Tony.

Are you coming over
for dinner?

I'd love to,
but I don't think I'd be
very good company tonight.

Ah.

Frederic Howe.

Received a Ph.D. from
Johns Hopkins University.

No surprise there.
He had a favorite professor.

A man who retired
from teaching and went on
to pursue a higher office.

Who is that?
President Woodrow Wilson.

He personally
appointed Mr. Howe as
Director of Immigration...

For the Port of New York.

[ Flynn ]
Frederic Howe?

Agent Flynn.
This is Agent Ravarini.
Bureau of Investigation.

Your secretary called
and said you were coming.

I was shocked
when I heard what
happened to that boy.

And then to learn that
the package was stolen
from my doorstep.

Do you have any suspects?

No, sir, not yet.

We're hoping that you might
have some idea who sent it.
No, I don't.

What exactly are
your duties here, sir,

As Director of Immigration
at the Port of New York?

Well, pretty much
what the title implies.

Immigrants are thoroughly
screened, and I sign off
on those who are admitted...

Sometimes thousands every week.

When the next ship comes in,
this building will be
flooded with people.

That's a big
responsibility.
[ Scoffs ]

Bigger than you can imagine.

I wish
I could let everyone in.

But I can't.
It's not possible.

However, only two percent
are turned away.

How do you decide
who gets in
and who doesn't?

Well, it's an intricate process.

Each candidate is given
a medical exam
and an intelligence test,

And we send those reports
to Washington.

Is it possible that
a relative of someone
you denied entrance to...

May wish to seek revenge?

Do you happen to have
a list of immigrants
that weren't let in?

This is a list of
the names of every immigrant...

Who failed his evaluation
in the last 60 days.

Russo, Costa, Moretti.

These are the people
that were turned away,

They got a million relatives
in New York.

It's not the ones
who got turned away
I'm worried about.

It's the ones
who made it through.

[ Man ]
Come to the workers' meeting.
Join the union. Very important.

Here.

Here.

You have to come, eh?

These guys'll know
how to handle this, Father.

Hello, Father.
This way.

[ Frank ] I called as soon as
the pastor told me what we had.

I figured this would be
in your jurisdiction.

Where is it?
Right there,
under the pew.

I'm gonna ask all of you
to wait outside.

Father?

That includes you.
I'm not goin' anywhere.

All right,
let's see what
we've got here.

Take a look at this.

Whoever pulls the hymnal
triggers the whole thing.

You see that?

Have a look on the other side.
Yeah.

What have you got?
There is a piece of twine...

That is running up from the box
into the shelf.

Have you got
your pocketknife?
Sure thing.

All right. Have you
sharpened it recently?
Yup.

Okay.
Now when you cut it,

Cut one strand at a time.

Just easy...
Hey, boss,
I already cut it.

You what?

What?
The box, it's leaking.

[ Grunts ]
No.

Did you notice any strangers
in church this morning?

I see new faces every day,
Mr. Flynn.

My parishioners run the gamut
from the very poor
to the extremely wealthy.

And who in particular might sit
in that front pew?

It's reserved
for Mayor Hylan
and his family.

Thank you.

Thank you, Mattie.

Where we going?
The post office.

Oh.
Thank God you guys are here.

A truck came in yesterday
with a delivery.

I got suspicious.

So I called the police.

Oliver Wendell Holmes.
J.P. Morgan.

Rockefeller.

Is this all of them?
No.

These are the ones
with insufficient postage.

You mean to say
there are others?

A few went out
on the mail truck
this morning.

[ Shouting, Indistinct ]

[ Flynn ]
We have an appointment
with Mr. Rockefeller.

William Flynn, Eugenio Ravarini.

This way, gentlemen.

Your hats?
Thank you.

Gino.
Your hat.

Thank you.

[ Ravarini ]
So how'd you get us in here?

[ Flynn ]
I told Rockefeller's people that
the Bureau wants to know...

Why a package bomb
has his name on it.

That got his attention.
[ Whistles ]
How'd you like to mow that lawn?

I wouldn't.
Your shoes.

Thanks.

You can imagine how unsettling
it must be,

Having radicals camped
on your front lawn.

Never had a front lawn, sir,
so I wouldn't know.

John D. Rockefeller.

Agents Flynn and Ravarini,
I presume?
Pleased to meet you, sir.

Attorney General Palmer
tells me you're two
of the Bureau's best men.

You must feel a great deal
of responsibility.

For what, sir?

For being the lone guns,
so to speak, here in New York.

I think we've done pretty well
by ourselves so far. Thank you.

I have a feeling
that's about to change.

It's Attorney General
Palmer.

William.
Mitchell.

Young man.
Sir.

John, I see
you've met Agent Flynn.
Yes, I have.

He's our bomb expert.
The very best we have.

I want you two gentlemen
to meet someone.

This is John Hoover.
I prefer J. Edgar.

I've heard a great deal
about both of you.

[ Rockefeller ]
Well, come, let us be seated.

[ Flynn ] This is some surprise.
You usually don't get to
leave Washington.

The president is
extremely concerned
about these... packages.

That's why I brought
J. Edgar here with me.

I've appointed him head of
the Justice Department's
Radical Division.

What's that?
Radical Division?

It's a fairly new office.
He's compiled quite a list...

An impressive list of names and
addresses of people suspected
of various radical activities.

And for what purpose?

For the purpose of arresting
and deporting undesirables.

What exactly
is an undesirable?

Individuals and groups of people
whose intent is to overthrow
the United States government.

You think this is a conspiracy
to overthrow the government?

Well, we're not quite sure
of that, but we're not going
to take any chances.

Ah.

How many names
are we talking about?

Over 10,000 so far.

You can't be serious.
You want to deport
10,000 people?

More or less.
What about due process?

How are you gonna
justify the warrants
for that many people?

We are working on that one.
J. Edgar?

These radicals are
targeting powerful men.

That hasn't gone
unnoticed.

Well, it might only be a handful
who are actually
making the bombs.

But until we find out
who's behind this,

We can't afford
to take that risk.

The president wants to send
a strong message...

That American democracy
is impervious.

When the news of those packages
at the post office
hits the papers,

Ordinary citizens
will be afraid
to open their own mail.

[ Clears Throat ]

Uh, Mr. Rockefeller,
if I may?

Uh, who...
Who do you think
is trying to kill you?

I'm the wealthiest man
in America.

Half the people want to be me.

The other half want me dead.

Perhaps we should concentrate
on the second half.
[ Palmer Chuckles ]

Anyone particular in mind?

I'd start with a labor agitator
named Carlo Tresca.

He's the head
of the local I.W.W.

And what about
all those people
on your front lawn?

They seem pretty upset about...
Justice for Ludlow.

What about Ludlow?

Ludlow was a coal mine.
It was a labor dispute?

It was one of your mines,
right, sir?

Several of the miners
under my employ went on strike.

And when an attempt was made
to persuade them
to go back to work,

A riot erupted,
and we were forced to
summon the National Guard.

When several miners
were killed unnecessarily.

That's one side of the story.

But I assure you
there's more to it than that.

Oh, I'm sure there was.
I'm sure there was.

So you think this
Carlo Tresca character might
have something to do...

With why your name
ended up on a package bomb
at the post office?

He went to Ludlow
during the strike and
provoked the situation.

Ah, is that right?

He invades legitimate companies
and gets the workers riled up.

He makes them believe
they deserve
something better.

Well, that is a union
organizer's job after all,
isn't it?

Let me make something
perfectly clear,
Agent Flynn.

The miners
and their families...

Were given a roof over
their heads, food, clothing.

Everything they needed
was provided for them.

Yes, and how exactly
does that work,
the food and clothing?

Aren't the miners paid
in some form of scrip...

So they're forced to shop
at the company store?

At least that's
my understanding of it.

They're not forced to
do anything, Agent Flynn.

They can leave
any time they like.

But, uh, their money's
no good anywhere else.

So essentially they are
forced to get their supplies
at your store,

And the money pretty well
goes directly back
into your pocket.

Are we going to have
a problem here, Mitchell?

[ Chuckles ] No, John.
As I told you before, Agent
Flynn's specialty is bombs.

I'm sure he'll leave
all political matters...

To those
who have a firmer grasp
of what's at stake.

Agent Flynn,
regarding those protestors
on my lawn,

I can assure you
I'm not about to
let myself be intimidated...

By a bunch of unemployed,
discontented immigrants.

No, sir,
I imagine you're not.

William.

William, what is
the matter with you?

You can't talk to
John Rockefeller like that.

Well, if you want me to find out
who's behind these threats,

I need to know why
John Rockefeller's name is
on the list of targets.

You find whoever
is causing this problem.
You bring him to me.

And then we'll reconsider
our approach, all right?

Now, J. Edgar and I
are setting up offices
at this address.

We have one week,
gentlemen.

One week.

[ Man Laughing ]

[ Men Speaking Italian ]

[ Italian Continues ]

[ Man ]
Here he is! Here he is!
Stand back.

Stand back!

What have you got, Frank?

Three dead bodies
and a woman
who isn't talking.

Have you I.D.'d
any of 'em?
Just the woman.

All I got out of her
was her name.
Louise Berger.

She was lucky she was at
the back of the apartment
when the place exploded.

It knocked her over,
but she's okay.

She still here?
Over there.

Mrs. Berger?

Are you all right?
I'll survive.

I'm William Flynn.

What happened here
last night?

The furnace...
must have exploded.

You were burning the furnace
in the middle of July?

It was cold last night.

People who were killed,
were they friends of yours?

I knew them.

Well enough
to know their names?

What were you doing with
dynamite in your apartment,
Mrs. Berger?

[ Exhales ]

It's a problem.

Boss.

I got something
you should see.

What does this say?

"Health is in you."

What is this?

That is
a bomb-making manual
that is so simple...

That anyone
who reads Italian
could figure this out.

I found something else.

Arthur Caron.
Industrial Workers
of the World.

This is a union card.

[ Door Opens ]

Good morning.
Good morning.

Can I help you gentlemen?
We're looking
for Carlo Tresca.

May I ask who's calling?
Department of Justice.

I'm Tresca.

William Flynn.
Eugenio Ravarini.

Ravarini?

Uh, we'd like to talk to you
about the explosion on
Lafayette Street last night.

[ Scoffs,
Mutters In Italian ]

Was Arthur Caron
a member of your union?

[ Ravarini ]
Hey.

Eh, amico. We found
this card in the rubble.

The I.W.W.
has 60,000 members,
Agent Flynn.

It's not my business to keep
track of what they're doing
on their free time.

I'm not a priest.

Do you have any idea
why Mr. Caron might
be making bombs?

Maybe it has something to do
with the massacre at Ludlow.

The man you should be talking to
is John Rockefeller, not Tresca.

We all know
what happened at Ludlow.

No.
You think you know.

But you don't know.

Maybe it's more clear
you see for yourself.
Come.

The miners went on strike.

And they are evicted
from company-owned homes,

Forced to live in tents
at the base of the camp.

These are immigrants...
Italian, German, Russian.

When they refuse to
return to the mine,

The National Guard
is call in...

And they mount a Gatling gun
on the top of an armored car...

That circle the camp
every night and shine a light
into the tent.

But they do not stop there.

Shots are fired into the camp.
[ Automatic Gunfire ]

[ Screaming ]
Families are running
for their lives.

They burn the tents
to the ground,

And in the morning...

A terrible, terrible
discovery is made.

Eleven children and three women
were found in a pit...

They had dug
to escape the gunfire.

They had suffocated
from the smoke.

If you want to know...

What the workers' movement
is really about, Agent Flynn,

You come to the meeting.

[ Speaks Italian ]

You will see.

I have to let you go,
Bartolo.

Don't I do my job well?
It's not that.

I can make better.
Your work is fine.

What's next, Uncle?

It's a family issue.

I understand.

Oh. I forgot the coffee.
I'll get it.

What's the matter with you?
How's work, Tony?

Mr. Flynn
asked you a question.
Answer him.

Ahh, they probably work
the words right out of him.

They spit on me.

What?
Who spit on you?

My crew boss.
My mick crew boss.

I don't understand.
Why would he do this?

Mom, they think that
just because they got here
before we did...

that they own the place.
Who, Tony?

The Irish.

Apologize to Mr. Flynn.

Conchetta,
it's all right.
Why is Mr. Flynn here?

Pop died because of him, and now
he gets to sit in Pop's chair
and eat our food?

[ Bangs Table ]
That's enough, Tony!

[ Knocking ]

Come in, Eugenio.
Thank you, Mrs. Cafiero.

Hey, Tony.
Gino.

You ready to go?
Yeah.

Want a biscotti, hmm?
Yes, please.

[ Man ]
Who's speakin' tonight?
[ Men Chattering ]

[ Young Man ]
So, what goes on
in these meetings?

The union man
comes in once a week
to sign up new members.

I want you to
meet a friend of mine,
Tony Cafiero.

This is Carlo Valdinoci.
You from the neighborhood?

Mulberry Street.
You got a job?

Tony's a laborer.

Come see me
after the meeting, okay?

[ Tresca ]
Thank you for coming!

Is good to see
so many new faces.

I know why you are here.

You have been abused.

You have suffered injustice
no man should suffer.

Right.
And for what?

Because you seek a better wage.

You seek a better life.

And for this,
you are rewarded
with no life at all.

We are not living
in a free society.

This is tyranny!
I say enough!

I say rise up as one union!

Give your voice
to the I.W.W.

And let the I.W.W.
speak as one voice
for you!

How much is this gonna cost?
But a few pennies
from your weekly wage.

[ Shouting ]
A few pennies for the dignity
that has been taken from you.

Tresca's a fool!
No union!

No union!
Galleani!

Galleani! Galleani!

[ Shouting Continues ]

[ Inaudible ]

[ Shouting Quiets ]

When we talk of masters
and governments and laws,

religions, unions...
[ Men Jeering ]

We tell you.
We don't want any of that.

Yeah!
That's right!

You must destroy
those institutions
with your fists.

[ Men Agreeing ]
He's right.

Without bloodshed,
there is no progress.

Anarchy now.

[ Cheering ]
Anarchy!

Anarchy forever!

[ Cheering ]

We should keep an eye on him.

You speak the truth
from in your heart.

I'm really moved
with your message.

What is your name?

Bartolomeo Vanzetti.

Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Vanzetti.

And I wanna
help the workers.

Is one thing to want to help.

Is another to succeed.

Our union is looking for workers
from the big factories.

I'm sorry.

Is there anything else?

I like to write.

You seem a determined man,
Mr. Vanzetti.

Maybe some day your writing
will make a difference.

Well, this is your
so-called workers' meeting?

This is no longer
my meeting.

Looks like a call to arms to me.

He like
to hear himself talk.

My concern, Agent Flynn,

Is that the worker
be treated with dignity.

A proper wage
for the labor.

This is the mission
of the I.W.W.,
not this suicide, violence.

Somebody always build
a bigger gun.

[ Man ]
Here he comes.

[ Muttering In Italian ]

Let's go.

That's Carlo Valdinoci.
He grew up down the street
from me.

Tony.

What are you boys
doing here?

I'll see you tomorrow.

Let's go home.

[ Door Opens ]
Where have you been?

I was, um...
I was with Santino.

And I saw them out
walking and...
I gave them a ride home.

[ Speaks Italian ]

You need to
speak with him.
It's still too early, Conchetta.

It's...

I understand how he feels.

He doesn't want his father
to be forgotten.
You have to try.

William,
he's my son.

And this...
This can't work
without him.

You're right.

We may have a lead, sir.
Someone I think we should
keep an eye on.

Who?
A fellow by the name
of Galleani.

He gave a speech
at a union meeting
we went to last night.

It was a pretty
inflammatory one.

He called for bloodshed.
He called for
a workers' revolt.

We're aware of Galleani.
His name's on my list.

Well, is there anyone else
on your list you want me
to tell you about?

You keep tracking this...

This Louise Berger from that
bombing on Lafayette Street.

And keep an eye
on that Galleani character.

You let me know
what he's up to.

[ Clears Throat ]
Yes, sir.

[ Knocking ]

Miss Goldman.
Agent Flynn.

Sit. I haven't seen you
since you arrested me
at that rally last year.

Water?
No, thank you.

How do you know
Louise Berger,
Miss Goldman?

She's a writer.
She writes.

For you?
Well, for your magazine?

On occasion.
What does
she write about?

Bombs, by any chance?

What is this magazine
all about?
Mother Earth?

Politics, labor issues,
atheism,

Sexuality, feminism.

Our readers are
educated free-thinkers,

All of them interested
in social change.

Is that social change
through discourse
or violence?

Come on, Emma.
I'm not one of your
wide-eyed Village recruits.

A young boy was killed because
there are people out there...

Using your sort of rhetoric
as an excuse.

That is not my rhetoric.

What do you think
anarchism is about?

Well, I don't much care,
if it promotes violence
and destruction.

Now I'd like to talk
about Louise Berger,
if you don't mind.

Talk.

Is she consorting
with bomb makers or not?

Do I look like an agent
of the police department?

No.

No, you don't.

Any luck?
Yeah, the Irish sort.

Everyone talking,
nobody saying a thing.

We will go back to work.
We will get a raise.
No worry. I'll take care of you.

Stay here or go home.
They have no right to do this.

We are one.
What does he care?

You tell these scabs to go home!

Back off, you wop.
[ Italian ]

You son of a...

[ Sirens Wailing ]

Polizia!

Break it up!

Get up.

[ Panting ]

Alfonsina, we have a guest.

Alfonsina.
Nicola.

Sit.
[ Italian ]

To be chased
by the police
makes me feel so alive!

If only it could
happen every day.

Alla vita.
Alla vita.

William.
Conchetta,
go back inside.

What's going on?
Just go inside
your apartment.

Tony, go inside.
Come on.

Come on.
Close the door!

[ Clicks ]

[ Water Running ]

Conchetta, did
you see anyone deliver
a package for me today?

No. No.

Were you here all day?
I was, yeah.

What about you, Tony?
I was at work.

Oh, right, of course.

Mr. Flynn, do you wonder why
these bombs keep showing up
on people's doorsteps?

Is that what that
package was, William?
It's all right, Conchetta.

I've taken care of it.
We're safe.

We're safe.
You think we're safe?

You really don't get it yet.
Well, what do you mean
by that, Tony?

Tony?
I'll do it.

Tony.

Say, I had a thought.

I could've doused that bomb
at the church a good
two seconds before you did.

You took a big risk.

It's just a fact.

You know
Michael Cafiero and I
were partners?

Oh, yeah, I'm aware of that.

Yeah, well,
a couple of years ago,

We were investigating
these two gentlemen...

Who were running a bucket shop
in the financial district.

It was a huge scam,
hundreds of thousands of dollars
were involved.

And we were posing,
or trying to pose,

As a couple of fine gentlemen
from Cleveland
with a lot of money to invest.

And we had pretty much
ingratiated ourselves
to these fellows, uh,

Or so we thought.

On the evening
when we were gonna
make the arrests,

We were at this restaurant
on Broad Street.

It's not very far from here.

And the four of us
were sitting at a table...

Actually there
were five of us.

There was one big fellow
who was not sitting.

And just as I was about
to take possession
of the incriminating evidence,

One of the guys asks us...

Do we know a banker
from Cleveland
by the name of Harris.

And before I could think
of anything clever to say,

Michael decides
that we don't.

Shakes his head. Says no.
"Well, he knows you,"
the guy says.

It's the oldest ploy
in the book.

And whether we knew them or not,
our cover was blown
right then and there.

And then,
for some strange reason,

Mike excuses himself,
stands up and goes
into the men's room.

And I'm left there,
trying to figure out what to do.

Knowing full well
I should've gone in there
after him.

But I didn't.

And then shots ring out.
[ Gunfire ]

Big fellow busts out
into the room, firing away.

I take a slug in the leg.

I dive for the floor,
and the three of 'em run
out of there like rabbits.

And I crawl over
to where Mike is.

And there's nothing to be done,
because he's gone.

That's why I did what
I did at the church.
I wasn't gonna let you down...

The way I let
Tony's father down.

Well, here we go.
[ Clears Throat ]

Is that our boy?
Yeah, that's him.

[ Engine Starts ]

Ready for this?
Yeah.

[ Ravarini Whispers ]
Hey, boss. Over here.

[ Italian ]

[ Flynn ]
Our old friend Galleani.

[ Galleani ]
Is this the entire list?

Yes, sir.
We have a package
for every name.

[ Galleani ]
Very well.
That's good enough.

Come with me.
I want to show you something.
Okay.

You take the little guy.
I'll take Galleani.

Let's go.

[ Grunts, Groaning ]

Come on.
Come on. Hit me.

[ Valdinoci Shouts
In Italian ]
Better run!

[ Grunting ]
Boss! Boss, take my hand.

Almost there, boss.
[ Grunting ]

Thanks.

Where's the other guy?
Don't worry about him.

He's not goin' anywhere.

[ Flynn ]
What's his name?

[ Speaks Italian ]
Andrea Salsedo.

Ask him who
these packages are for.

No? He doesn't know.

Ask him again.

Swears on his mother's grave
that he's telling the truth.

Sit him up.

Let's go.
Wait a second. What if
he's telling the truth?

John Rockefeller.

[ Continues In Italian ]

The packages are for
all the board members
of the People's Institute.

Grazie.

What are you doin'?

Boss, it's...
Hold your horses.

It's 2:00
in the morning.

Just...

[ Mutters ]

Read that.

Read it.

"The People's Institute."

A creedless church
for churchless people.

A self-governed club...

"Whose members consist of
entrepreneurs, clergy,
society's elite."

It's a rich boys' club,
boss. Who cares?

Keep reading.

"The primary purpose is
to assist in the democratic
evolution of society"...

Right.
The democratic evolution...
No.

"To assist
in the democratic
evolution of society..."

And to defeat
the evil forces
of socialism and anarchism...

"By whatever means necessary."

That explains a few things,
but where are you
going with this?

So far, three out of four
members of the board
of this institute...

Have been targeted.

Are you certain?
Yes, sir, and every one
of those bombs...

Was due to go out
in the morning mail.

Good Lord.

Mr. Howe,
can you tell us anything
about the People's Institute?

You are a member
of the board, are you not?
Yes. I'm its president.

It's a unique
educational enterprise.

We offer scholarships
to immigrants who demonstrate...

Exceptional aptitude
for higher learning.

Who were these packages at
that warehouse addressed to?

John Rockefeller,
Mayor Hylan, all of your
fellow board members...

All your fellow board members,
in addition to the one
that was meant for you, sir.

And what about
Attorney General Palmer?

Was there a package
addressed to him?

How long has
the Attorney General been
a member of your board?

Since last year.

And these scholarships...
How long has the institute
been giving them out?

Several years.

Do you have a list
of the recipients
we could take a look at?

I'm sure I can dig one up
if you come by my office.

I'd appreciate that, sir.

What do you
make of that?
I'm not sure.

But we need to get
our hands on that list...

And see who else
might be benefiting
from the rich boys' club.

When you did not
come home last night,

I was very worried.

Who put that package
by your door?

Some anarchists,
Conchetta.

They're trying to hurt
some powerful men.

Not that
I'm one of them,

But I think
I'm making them nervous.

Hmm.

Oh, my God.

Hmm.

What happens, huh,
if I lose you too?

You're not gonna lose me.
I promise.

[ Both Chuckle ]

Mitchell.

What's this?

That is a list of everyone
who's ever received
a scholarship...

From the People's Institute.

Some very interesting names
on that list.

One in particular that
stands out from the others.

Who would that be?

Luigi Galleani.

A promising candidate,
apparently,

And handpicked by yourself
and John Rockefeller.

We offered an education
to an immigrant
who turned against us.

So what?
Mitchell, you've known
all along...

That Luigi Galleani was
the one who was sending out
these package bombs,

And as long as you knew
he was out there
spreading fear,

You could arrest
whoever you wanted.

Mitchell, we know
you've been supporting him
financially.

You know
what your problem is?

You believe that everyone
has the right to freedom.

But freedom
isn't a right.

It's a commodity
whose price fluctuates
according to supply and demand.

And when they start
throwing bombs
into our backyards...

And blowing up
our front porches,

The people
expect their government
to do something about it.

And they don't give a damn
how we do it.

They just want it done.

They just want to
be assured that
their children are safe...

When they tuck them
into bed at night.

And that...

That is what
we give them, William.

Assurance.

[ Mews ]

[ Mewing Continues ]

[ Chuckles ]

Beltrando.

Do you like him?

He's for you.

How cute.

I'm very grateful
to you and Vincenzo.

I've never been treated
like this...

So much kindness.

Never in my life.

Vincenzo likes you.

You know,
he thinks you are a poet.

Vincenzo is the real poet.

Vincenzo cares
for his family...

And struggles
for the rights of the workers,

And this is real poetry to me.

You know, you remind me
of my mother when
she was a girl, Alfonsina.

She was very sweet.

We were kids...

She was really happy.

Grazie.

[ Crowd Applauding, Cheering ]

[ Goldman ]
Anarchism is the teacher
of the unity of life.

[ Applauding, Cheering
Continue ]

To accomplish this unity,

Anarchism must declare war
on the pernicious influences...

That prevent
the harmonious blending...

Of the individual
and society.

[ Crowd Cheering ]

My friends. My friends!

These are the ashes
of the fallen.

But they did not
die in vain.

They died for you.

They died for your right...

To a fair share of what
has been taken from you...

By the machine
of capitalism!

We cannot allow this...
[ Continues, Indistinct ]

You should let these people
have their say.

Can you help me?
Over there.

Here. Here.

You okay?
Look at me. Look at me.

Here.

Grazie.

Are you all right?

Go back to your homes.
It's useless. It's useless.
It's useless.

Go home. Go home.

Attorney General Palmer,
did you arrest the ones
behind the bomb plot today?

Who's your
number one suspect?

A radical by the name
of Luigi Galleani.

G-A-L-L-E-A-N-I.

No one is safe
until that man is shipped
back to where he belongs.

Now if you'll
excuse me, gentlemen,
that'll be all for today.

If I'm gonna catch
that heathen, you have to
let me get back to work.

[ All Chuckling ]
Thank you.

[ Knocking ]

William.

Mitchell,
what are you doin'?

My job.

And what is that exactly?

Beating up
on innocent people?

I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

They weren't harming anybody.
They were holding
a memorial service.

For anarchists,
right in front
of City Hall.

They were making
a mockery out of
our justice system, William.

I will not
stand for that.
I will not!

So you're gonna go through
with all these arrests?

We're not only going to
go through with it,

We're going to
move on them tonight.

Even after you told
the reporters that Galleani
is the man we're after?

Mitchell, what's going on?

[ Scoffs ]

Fine.

"To look for my happiness
in the happiness of others,"

For my worth in the worth
of those around me...

"That is my faith,
the aspiration
of my whole life."

He was a great writer,
Bakunin.

[ Loud Footsteps ]

[ Man ]
You, with the bike!
Stop right there!

[ Man #2 ]
Let's go.

[ Man #3 ]
All right.
Into the wagon with ya.

[ Man ]
Luigi! Next!

[ Italian ]

[ Man ]
Pagano! Pagano!

[ Man #2 ]
I was arrested at work.
How about you?

They pulled me
away from dinner.

Excuse me.
Firmino.

Firmino.

Firmino.

Excuse me.

It's gonna be all right.

What the hell do you think
you're doing?

I know this man.
He's my butcher.
He does not belong here.

His name's on the list.

[ Paper Rustles ]

Screw your damn list.
Let's go home.

You're not goin' anywhere.
Sit down.

Hey.
[ Grunts ]

Mitchell.

Mitchell,
look at these people.

They're not killers.

These are the ordinary citizens
you're supposed
to be protecting.

William,

The face of terror
isn't some monster
you don't recognize.

It's the people
who live next door.

Then you'd better
be prepared to arrest
every immigrant in America.

And that'd be about 60 million.

All right.
We're finished here.

I'm sure there's some...

Desk job in Washington
that's better suited to your...
sensibilities.

William.

Excuse me.

Boss!

6,429.

And that's
just one night.

And Galleani's
still out there.

Hey. What are we
gonna do about it?

What are we
gonna do about it?

Yeah, what am I
gonna do about it?

Mr. Flynn.

The government's
arrested Mr. Gallo.

They're arresting everybody.
We gotta go.

Is this true, William?
I'm afraid so, Conchetta.

So why don't you go
do something about it?
Go get him outta jail.

He's innocent.
I tried, Tony.

You're just gonna
let them get away with it?

[ Door Slams ]
My father would have
done something about it!

Tony!

[ Horn Honks ]

[ Car Approaches ]

Hey, Tony.
Take a ride with me.

There's someone
I want you to meet.

[ Knocking ]
[ Door Opens ]

William. William.
They've taken Tony.

I found this note
on your door.

[ Gasps ]

What? What?

What do I do?
What do we do?

Conchetta, I need you
to stay here.
All right?

William,
you have to find him.

You have to find him,
and you've got
to bring him home.

I'm going to find him.
I'll bring him home.

I promise.

Hello, Miss Berger.

What are you doing here?

I might ask you
the same question.

I live here.
Thought you lived
over on Lafayette Street.

It's currently unlivable.

Miss Berger, I'm in no mood
for playing games with you.

How do you know
this man?

He's an old friend.

Is Luigi Galleani
an old friend too?

Miss Berger,

I know you're no stranger
to violence.

Well, neither am I.

Now I need some answers,
and I need them right now.

Can you tell me
where these men are?

[ Flynn ]
So how do you know
Galleani?

Carlo Valdinoci
introduced us.

And then I met
Emma Goldman.

She taught me that violence
doesn't solve anything.

It just creates
more violence.

Stop the car.

The house is
on the other side
of those trees.

All right. Let's go.

I brought you here.
This is as far as I go.

Go.

[ Tony ]
Mr. Flynn! Mr. Flynn, over here!

Cover me.

Go.

Mr. Flynn! Mr. Flynn!

Tony. I'm right here.

Let's get out of here.
Go! Go, go, go! Let's go!

Step on it.

[ Tires Screech ]

Bartolomeo Vanzetti,
you're under arrest.

[ Vanzetti ]
What do you want?
What do you want?

You must be Sacco.
You're coming too.

Nicola! Nicola! Nicola!

[ Man ]
You know what you did,
you wop.

You murdered
those two payroll guards
in cold blood.

Let me go.
Nicola! Nicola!

[ Rings ]

Hello?
[ Man ]
This is the police department.

We've arrested your tenant,
Bartolomeo Vanzetti, for murder.

Thought you'd want to know.

SÃ¬. SÃ¬, grazie.

[ Man #1 ] There you are.
[ Man #2 ] Thank you, signore.
Enjoy the show.

[ Man #2 Continues
In Italian ]

Thank you, signora.
Enjoy the show.

[ Continues ]

** [ Classical ]

Nicola Sacco,

A jury has found you guilty of
the capital offense of murder.

Have you anything to say
why sentence of death
should not be passed upon you?

I know the sentence
is between two classes.

Always there will be
a collision between
one and the other.

I am here today for being
of the oppressed class,

But it is you
who are the oppressors.

I am never guilty.

Not yesterday,

Not today,

Not forever.

Bartolomeo Vanzetti,

Have you anything to say
why sentence of death
should not be passed upon you?

I'm not only innocent
of these crimes
you say I have committed,

But I struggled all my life
to eliminate the exploitation...

And the oppression
of the man...

By the man.

I've never stolen.

I've never killed.

I've never spilled blood.

Yet you see me before you...

Not ashamed or in fear
because I am innocent.

To all of society I say,

Beware.

You are in a catacomb...

Of the flower
of mankind.

For what?

For what?

All that they promise,
it is a lie.

It is an illusion.

They have
promised you liberty.
Where is liberty?

They have
promised you prosperity.
Where is prosperity?

And I have suffered
because I am an Italian.

And indeed, I am an Italian.

I've suffered
because I am a radical.

And indeed,
I am a radical.

You can
only kill me once,

But if you could
kill me two times,

If I could be reborn,

I would live again...

To do what I've done
already.

[ Vendor ]
Thanks, mister.

Extra! Extra!

Sacco and Vanzetti
get the electric chair.
Read all about it!

[ Door Opens ]

William.
I didn't see you.
Mitchell.

Congratulations
for bringing Galleani in.

We can all breathe a lot easier
now that maniac's
off the streets.

And it's too bad about, um,
Detective Swanson.

He'll be missed.

So now that we've got our man,
you can let everyone else go.

I wish it were that easy,
but unfortunately,
that's not the case.

Mitchell,
it is that easy.
You can do it.

[ Stammers ]
You should do it.

Before it's too late.

I'd like to stay and chat,
but there's some newsmen
waiting for a statement.

Why don't you join me,
Agent Flynn?

I'm sure the reporters
would appreciate a few words
from their local hero.

No, you go ahead, Mitchell.

I've never been much
for giving speeches.

No. I wouldn't think so.

[ Man ]
Attorney General Palmer!
[ Reporters Clamoring ]

Sir! Sir!
Attorney General Palmer!

One question at a time, boys.
One at a time.

Attorney General Palmer,
it's been reported...

You have
over 10,000 people
in custody,

Including Luigi Galleani,
Emma Goldman,

And have issued arrest warrants
for thousands more.

Galleani and Goldman
were deported this morning,
along with dozens of others.

We're taking every precaution
to ensure the safety
of honest, law-abiding citizens.

[ Clamoring Resumes ]

It's been rumored
that the president
won't seek reelection,

And you might have
interest in that office.

Are you going to run?

I will serve my country
in whatever capacity
the public sees fit.

Is that a yes?
What about the others?
They can't all be guilty.

This is a difficult time
that requires
difficult decisions.

Right, William?

Thanks to Agent Flynn here,
we can all sleep better tonight.

He's the one to be commended.

I believe this young man
asked a question
about some others?

All those innocent people
dragged from their homes...

I wonder how
they're sleeping tonight.

Let me remind you...

And all of you...

That these are
dangerous individuals...

Who will stop at nothing
to destroy our way of life.

Many of those individuals
are women and children.
How can you justify that?

Out of the mouths of babes.

Oh, you ungrateful
son of a bitch.

You think this is
all cut-and-dried?

You think making the world
safe for democracy
is an easy business...

Where everybody
keeps his hands clean?

Don't be so damn naive.

There are other Galleanis
out there, waiting...

Waiting to make their move.

And I will do whatever it takes
to prevent that from happening.

As long as you're putting
the right people behind bars.
You're goddamned right.

Because there's
a lot of folks
who put their trust in you...

To do that
and only that, Mitchell.

The Justice Department
never had the authority...

To issue those warrants
in the first place.

It's always been
the jurisdiction
of the Labor Department.

You should have
a look at this.

What the hell is this?
It's a letter,

Signed by
the Secretary of Labor...

And approved by the president
of the United States,

Which invalidates
the arrest warrants...

Of the thousands
of innocent people
you've been locking up,

And it calls for
their immediate release.

[ Clamoring Resumes ]

Extra! Sacco and Vanzetti
sentenced to death.

So what now, Gino?
What's on your plate?

I don't know.
Maybe I'll quit
and become a boxer.

Ah, that'd be putting
your noggin to a good use.

Don't get smart.
What about you?

I don't know. I'm not sure
about that job in Washington
they're offering me.

Director of the Bureau
of Investigation?

I think
you should take it.

You think so? Why?

Because then
I'd have your job,

And we both know
I could do it better
than you.

[ Chuckles ]

You know, you're probably
right about that.

Agent Flynn.

Agent Ravarini.
