(MAN YELLS)


ALL: Huh?

(ALL SCREAMING)


(ALL GASP)

(SCREAMING AND GROANING)



(GUNS COCKING)




(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Huh?


Punisher!

How the hell did you get
all these weapons, Cain?




Your mouth seems to
be working just fine.

You sadistic freak!


PUNISHER: I'm waiting.
Answer me.

(ELECTRONIC BEEPING)


(ENGINE WHIRRING)

Evening, Castle.
What have you got there?

Friend of yours?

PUNISHER: What are you
doing here, Black Widow?

Stay out of my way.

Director Fury says
he'd like to have
a word with you.

Then he should
get on a shuttle
and come down here.

I'm in the middle
of working.

You know this was
a S.H.I.E.L.D. op.
We had our eyes on them.

So did I.

Thanks to you,
this operation
has been compromised.

What you're doing
is going to cause them
to pull back

and make it more difficult
for us to track
and identify the supplier.

You play your games,
I stop these scum.

No court or prison,
just a bullet.

You're so shortsighted,
Castle.
Open your eyes.

Don't you think
you've done enough
for today?

Now hand Cain over.

Forget it.

(WIND WHOOSHES)

Hmm.

I'll say this
for a second time.
So listen, Black Widow.

Stay out of my way.

I won't warn you again.

Last chance,
hand him over.

You get no third warning.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

FURY: Frank!

FURY: Frank...

I only need a minute.
And it's very important.

I presume it's
something important to you.

Is that right, Fury?

Or should I
be addressing you
as Director Fury?


We go back a long way...

Well then, Director Fury,

you should know
that I'll do anything
to get the job done.

Oh, I'm aware of that.

PUNISHER: (SIGHS)
You haven't got a clue.

If you did,
then you would have
brought along more men.

If you really want to talk,
then tell your toy
soldiers to stand down.

(DARTS FIRING)


Widow...

FURY: I know
how his mind works.

And he won't forget that.

Too much talking.
And anyway,
he was threatening you.

Frank had no intention
of hurting me,
you know that.

BLACK WIDOW:
Can't be too safe.


Tie him up and take him
to the holding cell
on the Helicarrier.

As for Cain...

BLACK WIDOW:
Boss, I think

that may present a problem.

So, you're finally up.
How about
a hot cup of coffee?

About time.
Got a headache?

Come on, Frank.
You used to smile more,
back in the old days.


Yeah. A lifetime ago.

Look at what
you've become.

A self-appointed judge,
jury, and executioner.

You think
you're above the law.

You and that damned skull.

No question you're effective,
but there are rules
we have to follow.

It isn't
the wild west out there.

Not even for you.

As long as
you were attacking
low-level thugs,

I had no problem
with your methods,
and let you run free.

But this time,
I can't look the other way.

You've stepped
into my territory.

PUNISHER: I do
what I have to do,
that's all.

Come on!

This is a much
bigger operation than
you could ever imagine!

That's why
you're here in cuffs!

I can't have you
getting in the way
and screwing things up!

It costs too much
time and money!


And just how many people
do you think died

while you wasted
all that time and money?

Beyond that,
how many innocent lives

are you willing
to let be ruined

while you play things
by the book?

Kids died while you were
following the rules
with your operation.

You're not stupid,
Frank, so don't be
so damn shortsighted.

You want to win the battle.
I want to win the whole war.

You S.H.I.E.L.D. suits
are so concerned
with the war,

you forget about
all the people

who get caught
in the crossfire.

Who cares if you win,
if there's no one
left alive to celebrate?

We care that the bad guys
need to be stopped.

We're on the same
page in that regard.


To do that, though,

we have to destroy
the root of the problem,
not the tip of the branch.

If we don't
eliminate the network,

the whole thing is nothing
but an exercise in futility.

And the network is...

Leviathan.

You want to know
who's to blame?
They're the ones.

They're the terrorist
group responsible

for the high-tech
specialized assault weapons
flooding your streets.

Our biggest concern
at the moment

is that somehow
they've acquired

S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
proprietary weapons
technology.

And they've now begun
using it against us.

We know this
because the weapon's
operating system is based

on a unique technology
we've spent years developing.

As you can see,

the high-density laser is
concentrated into plasma,

which energizes the wakefield,
controlling its emission.

Since the technology
was created by S.H.I.E.L.D.,

the truth of the matter is,
you people have blood
on your hands, as well.

What are you gonna do,
Castle, come after
all of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

I'd like to see that.


We have been
a step behind.

We needed to track down
and neutralize
the manufacturer of the guns,

to prevent our technology
from being used for terrorism.

And Cain was going
to lead us to them.

Okay, then,
so what's the problem?

We've run into
an unexpected development.

Cain got away from us.

It happened
when we were busy
dealing with you.

What was it that
Cain told you?

Not a thing.

Yeah, I'm not buying that.

We think he told
you the location
of the guns.

We need that intel.

I have no intention
of becoming your informant,
Nick.

Well, if he did tell
you where to find them,
why not cooperate with us?

Take this thing off first.

FURY: You can't make demands.

If you refuse to
cooperate with us,
we'll lock you up.

I have one condition
before I'll say anything.

Do you really think
you're in a position
to make a deal?

Let me go after them.

Why would I allow that?

Isn't that really why
you brought me in here?

Well, I'm not gonna
play along, unless
you remove these now!

You should just give him
what he wants, Director.

The truth is
we're on a clock here
and there's no time to waste.

Yeah, I know.

HILL: All right,
we met your conditions.

Tell us the location
Cain gave you.


Hmm.

If you provide me
with some weapons,
I'll go in alone.


At first, you only
gave one condition.
To let you go.

Here's my condition.
From now on,
you take orders from me.

It's easier
if you stay out of it.

Unfortunately,
I can't allow that.

You'll have to adjust
to having a new partner.

I hope you can keep up.

PUNISHER: We may
be working together,

but I'm not taking
orders from you.

(COMPUTER BEEPING)

PUNISHER: Tell me what
you know about Leviathan.

BLACK WIDOW:
Didn't you read the brief?
It was all in there.

PUNISHER: It wasn't
very insightful.
Mostly bureaucratic nonsense.

BLACK WIDOW: <i> Leviathan</i>
<i>is a terrorist organization</i>

<i>that was formerly</i>
<i>a secret division</i>

<i>of Russian intelligence.</i>

PUNISHER: <i> Does that mean</i>
<i>you know some of the players?</i>

BLACK WIDOW:
<i>Only by reputation.</i>

<i>When Russia collapsed,</i>
<i>they all went underground</i>

<i>They expanded their power</i>
<i>by basing themselves</i>
<i>in economically poor regions</i>

<i>that had been devastated</i>
<i>by recurring wars.</i>

<i>They're involved</i>
<i>with every evil deed</i>
<i>known to man.</i>

<i>Human trafficking,</i>
<i>assassination, terrorism,</i>
<i>drugs, you name it.</i>

<i>They don't</i>
<i>claim responsibility</i>
<i>for their crimes,</i>

<i>and the objective</i>
<i>of the organization</i>
<i>is unknown.</i>

<i>That makes them</i>
<i>both terrifying</i>
<i>and dangerous.</i>

And with the technology
S.H.I.E.L.D.
has provided them,

they've now become lethal.

The most lethal
crime organization
anywhere in the world.

We didn't
provide it to them.
They stole it from us.

That doesn't
make a difference
to the dead civilians.

BLACK WIDOW:
The site down there
used to be a center

for biological
weapons research.

They had an accident
20 years ago
and shut down.

Their existence
was completely erased
from all records.


Hmm.

We'll make our move
when it gets dark.

The more time we waste,
the more victims
there are going to be.





Huh?

(ROPE RECOILING)


What the hell?

PUNISHER:
Are they all dead?

BLACK WIDOW:
No, they're alive.

At least, I think.


You need to forget
about Cain for now.

We have our orders.

We need to get the info
and then get the hell
out of here.

Not me.

Castle!
What do you think
you're doing here?

Don't forget,
you agreed to cooperate.

I showed you
Cain's location.

Castle!

My cooperation
ends here and now.

I'm not gonna let
you go rogue on us.


Damn it!

I'm not letting
that lowlife thug
get away with this.

He's the one who
provided the guns
that tore up my streets.

And because of that,

there's a whole lot of
innocent people who
didn't make it out alive.

I can't
let you blow this.

(BLACK WIDOW GRUNTING)


This is ridiculous.
We shouldn't be fighting.

Then just back off
and let me do things
my way.

You should know by now,
I don't play by your rules.

You and Fury need to
clean up your own mess.

(DOOR OPENS)


Yeah, right, Frank.


Damn it!




(BLADE UNSHEATHING)


Punisher!

All right then.
Now that you've slept,

you should be able
to think straight.


Who were the humans
in those pods?

Why the hell
are you here?

I'm asking the questions.

Orion will never allow
you to leave here alive!

You'll die a horrible death.

Now that's a shame.

Too bad you won't
be around to see it.

(CAIN GASPING)
Unless, of course,
you answer my questions.

CAIN: Okay, okay!
Just put that thing down!


(DART LAUNCHING)
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)




Tasha.

Elihas!

Is it you?

But how?

<i>You were...</i>

<i>Elihas Starr</i>

should be dead!

I'm sorry, Tasha.

I didn't want
this to be the way...
The way to tell you.


Bastard!

Natasha...

It is you.

You are, or were,
a S.H.I.E.L.D.
agent, Elihas.

But now you're
working for Leviathan?

And worse than that,

you're providing
them with weapons?

You traitor!

Tasha. Listen.

I was given
an opportunity to step up
and be better than I was.

To be more than
a S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist.

I had the chance
to have real power,
to be a warrior!

And why would that
matter in the end?

I'd be someone
who's finally
worthy of your love.

BLACK WIDOW:
<i>Why wouldn't you</i>
<i>think you're worthy?</i>

ELIHAS: <i> You're one of</i>
<i>the greatest spies</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

<i>And you're</i>
<i>a superhero on top of it!</i>

<i>In the end, a normal man</i>
<i>couldn't keep up with you.</i>

<i>You're an Avenger.</i>
<i>You were always running off</i>
<i>to save the world.</i>

You didn't know,
but all that time I
was at S.H.I.E.L.D.,

I was never really sure
where I stood with you.

Because you didn't have power,

you doubted my
feelings for you?

It wasn't so much that
I doubted your feelings.


<i>But when you think about it,</i>
<i>honestly examine it,</i>

<i>you always chose missions</i>

<i>and the Avengers over me.</i>

I just wasn't good enough.

Elihas, you're wrong.

Tasha... Let's work
together again, you and I.

You would be perfect!
Let me talk to Orion!

Is he the one
who's in charge here?

He heads up this cell,
but more than that,

he's very highly placed
in the organization.

You think you can convince him
to take me on?

I'm sure of it.
They trust me.

Natasha...

I want you to stay
and witness the new me.



Before I give you an answer,

tell me about the pods,
the people in them.

ELIHAS: They're the best
spies we could find,
recruited by Orion.

BLACK WIDOW: Recruited?

Don't you really
mean "abducted"?

Some, maybe,
but it's in the service
of a greater good.

They're the vanguard
of a new world!
When they wake up,

they'll be transformed
into living weapons.

They won't fear death.

These men, they will have
super powers of their own,

able to conquer any enemy.

Super-powered soldiers
at your command.
Is that right?

What have you done, Elihas?

I'm the one who
made all this possible.

The serum for
strengthening the body,

the reconditioning
technology...

I developed the whole thing!

All this for Leviathan?

You can see how
effective it is

by looking at me.

To make sure it worked,
I tested it on myself.

Where are these
soldiers to be deployed?

Everywhere.
Anywhere in the world,
anytime they may be needed!

So you're going to
go out and sell them?

We'll sell to
the highest bidder.

If two countries are at war,
we'll sell to both
sides of the conflict!

That just means
there'll be more death
wherever Leviathan goes.

Business is business.

If we don't supply
the weapons,
someone else will.

I just want them to continue
funding my research.

Elihas...

I'm not the boring
lab-drone I was
when I was at S.H.I.E.L.D.

I made use of
advanced technology!

I transcended
artificial boundaries.

I turned myself
into something better,

someone who is finally
worthy to stand by you.

Will you stay with me?




(ALARMS BLARING)



I didn't want to do this.
However, you leave me
no choice

but to take you down!

In reality, S.H.I.E.L.D.
is nothing more

than an organization
that uses fear to
keep people down.

We give people
a chance to fight back!

Is that what your boss says
to justify all of this?

Now is the time to
see that you've made

a big mistake!

Sorry, but you're the one
who needs to see, Natasha!



Did you find what
you were looking for?

I was interrupted.

And, what about you?

Hmm.

(ELECTRONIC BEEPING)

BLACK WIDOW: It's no use.

PUNISHER:
It's Cain's cell phone.

There has to be
something there.

The equipment we're using
isn't powerful enough.

I need this tomorrow. Huh?

What's he doing here?

(ALL GASPING)


You're pretty popular.



Marine Corps, huh?


(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(DOOR CLOSES)


BLACK WIDOW:
Amadeus!


I wasn't aware S.H.I.E.L.D.
allowed pets.

Geniuses tend to
get special treatment.


Wake up. I need you.


Oh, hello there,
Agent Romanoff.

It's been a while.
But you're still
as pretty as ever.

Yeah, save the flattery.

AMADEUS: Why are you
here today? You want to
continue our chess match?

Sure, if you want.

So, knight to F-6.

I'll go queen F-7!
And that's a checkmate!

Well, I guess you win again.


I can't seem to beat you
when it comes to games.

No kidding! I'll give
you some tips, though,

so you can compete
better next time.

I can teach you
how to transmit

my genius brain impulses
to your nerve cells!

It's my current research.

It works by
intercepting the chemical

synapse in the brain
before fusing with the...

A word of advice.
Keep talking like that,

and girls will avoid
you like the plague!

experienced enough
in that department.

I've got an idea!
How about a date to teach me!

I'll think about it.

But really, we should save
the world first.


Darn it!



Agent Romanoff.

Could that man
standing right there
be the Punisher?

Frank Castle,
meet Amadeus Cho.

He's young, but he's
the most talented
scientist at S.H.I.E.L.D.

Young, you say?
This kid looks
like a third-grader.

I have a very important
job for you, Amadeus.

You've got 10 minutes
to decrypt all the data
off this device.


Listen,
I have low blood pressure.

And I don't work well
right after I wake up.

Aw.

Too bad.
I had something special
in mind as a reward...

Hey, I'm feeling
a lot better now!

My blood pressure
and heart rate
are almost normal!

(ELECTRONIC BEEPING)
AMADEUS: Mmm...

It looks like
a regular smartphone,

but there's some
pretty sophisticated
software installed on it.

And there are several
layers of security locks
to keep out the looky-loos.

BLACK WIDOW:
I thought as much.
That's why I came to you.

You can do it, can't you?

That depends.

How long are you giving me?
Ten minutes?

If I go faster,
can I get a kiss?

You're a real smart-ass.

You're the one
getting all the kisses.

Kirby's a kisser,
that's for sure.

Mmm...

That's kind of weird...

What's wrong?

(ALARM BLARING)

(AMADEUS GASPS IN AWE)


(SAD WHINING)

(ALL ALARMS BLARING)

(AMADEUS GASPS)

Hope I didn't cause that.

That doesn't look
very good to me.

Yeah. I think I might have
turned something on.

Really? Like what?

Can you add more
time to the challenge?

I still kind of
want that kiss.

Castle...

Castle! What's wrong?

(AMADEUS YELLS)




Turn that thing off!

(AMADEUS WHIMPERING)


Shut it down, Amadeus!

I think it's gonna...

Oh, no! Oh, no!

It's gonna explode!
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(GUNS COCKING)


Hurry! Or else he's
gonna kill us all!




Oh, brother!
I'll never make it!

Even Tony Stark
couldn't pull this off!

If this lab explodes,

you can forget that kiss!

Don't panic!
I'll figure it out!

Castle, you've gotta
snap out of it!


Time for plan B!

PUNISHER: Did I do all this?

Oh, yeah. Big time.

BLACK WIDOW: I don't know how
Leviathan pulled it off,

but somehow you were being
controlled the whole way.

(GUNS COCKING)


Hold on. I want
everyone to back off
and stand down.

He was being controlled.

But he's fine now.
Let me talk to him.

PUNISHER: There's nothing
to talk about.

Castle...

Sorry.

(DOOR CLOSING)

BLACK WIDOW:
Elihas told me
he had developed

a brainwashing
technology he was using

to control
the Leviathan soldiers.

I think the same
thing was used on Castle.

<i>He didn't know</i>
<i>what he was doing.</i>

FURY: You may be right.

That's to be decided
after the investigation.

But right now,
I'm being pressured
to lock him up for life

<i>and throw away the key.</i>

I admit that what
he did was awful,
but you have to remember,

he wasn't in his right mind.

Just a minute.
Since when did you become
Frank Castle's best friend?


<i>I'm just saying...</i>
<i>He's not all bad.</i>

We broke the code
on that device.
We now have a lead.

And we need to
launch an Alpha strike
as soon as possible.

And we need to do it
before the bio-enhanced
soldiers of Leviathan

get scattered
throughout the world.

FURY: From what we've seen
so far, Leviathan's

brainwashing technology
is very powerful.

It can turn anyone
into a living weapon.

If that's the case,
we can't dispatch
the Avengers.

<i>That's why I decided</i>
<i>to put you in charge</i>
<i>of this mission.</i>

I see. So you knew
about the technology?

That they could
brainwash anyone?

We weren't absolutely
sure of that.

There's the possibility
that some past S.H.I.E.L.D.
projects

could have been compromised.
Some that couldn't
be implemented,

which were then canceled,
apparently fell into
the hands of Leviathan.

Among those projects
was one that centered on
mind-control research.

BLACK WIDOW:
That's why you
assigned me and Punisher,

for the same reason?

That's right.
Even if one or both of you
ended up getting brainwashed,

we'd be able to deal with it.

<i>Unlike the others.</i>

Protecting your ass?

FURY: I can't
really deny that.

<i>Sending people on a mission</i>
<i>without full intel</i>

<i>is just idiotic.</i>

I decide how much
information you need
to carry out the mission.

<i>Like knowing whether or not</i>
<i>you'd cut me loose</i>
<i>if I got brainwashed?</i>

Look, Natasha...

<i>Give me all</i>
<i>the information you have</i>
<i>pertaining to this operation.</i>

<i>If you don't,</i>
<i>some crazy brainwashed</i>

<i>female agent might</i>
<i>just come after you.</i>

<i>I take it you</i>
<i>knew about Elihas?</i>

I know this has
to be hard for you.
But listen...

Never mind.
Among the long list
of unanswered questions,

at least we know
where Leviathan
got our technology.

But there is one mystery...

FURY: Yes. How did he create
the bio-enhanced soldiers?

BLACK WIDOW:
<i>Elihas told me</i>
<i>he came up with a serum</i>

<i>that enhances</i>
<i>physical strength.</i>

That makes sense.
We know he stole

some classified data
before he supposedly died.

That's right.

Since he was dead,

we closed the case
and didn't bother
trying to follow up on it.

But in a later inventory,

we discovered he had taken
some very important
material with him.

And what would that have been?

FURY: <i> We're always trying</i>
<i>to protect our people</i>

<i>from catastrophic injuries.</i>

<i>We have DNA and blood reserves</i>
<i>for every agent,</i>

<i>in case an emergency</i>
<i>occurs during the course</i>
<i>of a mission.</i>

<i>Part of that</i>
<i>stock went missing.</i>

Then that means
those soldiers...

Super-powered soldiers
at your command.
Is that right?

What have you done, Elihas?

ELIHAS: I'm the one who
made all this possible.

The serum for
strengthening the body,

the reconditioning
technology...

I developed the whole thing!

<i>There's no time for</i>
<i>these feelings, Natasha.</i>

<i>I need you to keep</i>
<i>your head in the game.</i>

<i>It's extremely</i>
<i>critical that you remain</i>
<i>focused on your mission.</i>

<i>Continue your operation</i>
<i>to track Leviathan,</i>

<i>decipher</i>
<i>the brainwashing technology,</i>

<i>and destroy</i>
<i>the bio-enhanced soldiers</i>
<i>they've created.</i>

What am I supposed to
do about my partner?

<i>You don't have</i>
<i>a partner anymore.</i>



Elihas, you are on the verge
of bringing us all down.

What have you done?

(GUN FIRING)

(DOOR OPENS)

Did I hurt you?

I'm fine. I can still
spew out insults.

What did Fury say?

People want to put
you away, for life.

PUNISHER:
No less than I deserve.

When my family was
murdered in front of me,

I made myself into a weapon of
single-minded destruction.

I needed revenge,
and I took it!

But look at me now.

I killed three innocent
people in the process.

I can't be trusted
out there on my own.

I could be turned
at any moment.

That makes me
nothing but a liability
to the world at large.

And for that,
I need to be punished.

Before you get your 30 lashes,
scores needs settling.

I'm gonna do this my way!

BLACK WIDOW: That's fine.

Try not to interfere,
as I do things my way.

I've only met Ren once before.

He makes a business
providing information
to people

regarding the ins and
outs of the underworld

for a large sum of money.

<i>I found out about</i>
<i>Cain through him.</i>

BLACK WIDOW:
You paid him, did you?

<i>I guess you'll be paying</i>
<i>for this lead, as well.</i>

How cute.

PUNISHER: He owes me.

So no money will be needed.

BLACK WIDOW:
Owes you for what?

PUNISHER: A while back,
he contacted me.

His daughter had been
kidnapped and murdered.

It took me a while,
but I finally found
the murderer

and got rid of him.

(DOOR CLOSES)

Hello there, Frank!
How nice to see you again!

Almost as pretty as me,
when I was young.

PUNISHER: Ren.

Hello, Frank!

Leviathan, huh?

I didn't know
Cain and his men were

associated with
those traffickers.

Well, they are.

And I figure
the Leviathan auction
will be held anytime.

Tell me where and when.


It's the Leviathan auction.

Come on, don't tell me
you haven't heard of it.

Ren!

It's too risky, Frank.

If they found out I
leaked the information,
my life would be over.

I have to be
careful where I step.

I still have two daughters.

If the weapons
start circulating,
a lot of innocent people,

just like your daughters,
could be killed.


The whole thing is true.

There is going to
be a massive auction
held by Leviathan.

Tell us where.

It'll be in Madripoor.

Madripoor, you say?

My favorite place.

Makes sense,
it's a haven for criminals.

From what I understand,
this auction is
drawing particular attention

because their newest weapon
is rumored to be on the block.

There will be no
shortage of buyers
bidding for it.

When is it?
It's tonight. At 2:00 a.m.

We'll be there.

<i>Heads up, you two.</i>
<i>This piece just</i>
<i>ran on the news.</i>

FEMALE NEWSCASTER:
<i>We have footage of the</i>
<i>shootings and explosions</i>

<i>that took place in</i>
<i>the center of Dubai today...</i>

(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

Leviathan's enhanced soldiers.

<i>They're known as bio-soldiers</i>
<i>within the organization.</i>

<i>This is just in</i>
<i>to our newsroom.</i>

<i>Squads of soldiers</i>
<i>are on the scene...</i>

A little demonstration
of their product, I see.

<i>Get going.</i>
<i>There's no time left.</i>

BLACK WIDOW: We'll be
feet-dry in five minutes.

We should reach
Madripoor soon.

<i>Proceed with extreme caution.</i>

<i>And don't forget,</i>
<i>at some point you'll have</i>

<i>to explain how your</i>
<i>partner got out of the brig.</i>

BLACK WIDOW:
I don't have a partner,
remember?

FURY: <i> There's no way to</i>
<i>break the brainwashing.</i>

Don't worry about it.


Open the tactical link!

We're about to
commence alpha-strike!

HILL: Director.

Call from Tony Stark.

ORION:
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

<i>I hope you're</i>
<i>enjoying the entertainment.</i>
<i>We spared no expense.</i>

<i>Today, I have</i>
<i>the pleasure of welcoming</i>

<i>the most influential men</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

<i>all of whom have</i>
<i>gathered here at my request,</i>

<i>in anticipation</i>
<i>of seeing something</i>
<i>truly unique.</i>

<i>Gentlemen, beneath your feet</i>

<i>stands the pride of</i>
<i>our advanced technology.</i>

<i>Think about it.</i>
<i>You can program</i>
<i>your own super-powered army.</i>

<i>Never fear S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>
<i>or the Avengers again!</i>

<i>Take a look at</i>
<i>the bio-soldiers of Leviathan!</i>

SOLDIER: They're here.

Punisher and Black Widow.

And the Avengers?
Negative, sir.

On your right...

I see what you mean, Natasha.

It looks like
we're the prey here.

You were saying?


Frank! Don't kill them!

I have no choice!

They were all originally

innocent civilians, you know.

Now they're just
killing machines.

Don't forget one thing.

They were all
dragged into this!

The same way your family was!


I'm sorry, Frank.


(RUMBLING CONTINUES)



I invited some of my
friends to the party.

I hope that's okay.



Elihas!

Close your eyes!

What the hell?

Maybe he doesn't
have a brain to wash!

Sorry to make you wait.
I brought you something.

You need to hold it
up against your eyes.

Amadeus!

AMADEUS: I'm telling you,
this guy is harder
to ride than a horse.

Shows you what a guy
will do to get a kiss.

This coats your
pupils with a nano-device

that won't accept
the brainwashing signals
they're broadcasting.

Good work.

Thanks!


Go get him.
He's all yours, Widow.


(BOTH GRUNTING)

So, I see everything's
going well with
your new partner!

I hope you're happy together!



I did this,

all of this, just for you!

And now after all this,
you turn your back on me!

Why?

I sacrificed everything,

everything I'd
worked so hard for.

Just to obtain this power
that we could share together!

That's all I ever wanted.

I wanted to spend
the rest of my life
with you!

But I wanted to spend
that life as an equal,
worthy of your love!

What was wrong with that?
Was it too much to ask?

What was wrong with that?

You're insane!

Oh, Elihas...
You didn't think

I loved you
just the way you were?

Did you really think
so little of me?

Of yourself? Of us?

(BOTH GRUNT)


You did this
all for me?

How dare you?

How dare you
make me responsible
for all your crimes?

Then why?

What did I do
all of this for?


Why did I do this?

I never intended
to hurt you, Tasha.

Elihas...

Can you see that?

I just wanted to be
the kind of man who
deserved your love!

That's all...

That's all I wanted!

You never had to earn my love.
You had it by being yourself.

BLACK WIDOW: How did this
all go so wrong?

I always respected you
for the man you were.

And that was enough.

The Elihas Starr
that I always loved

didn't need
any special powers.

He just needed
to be there,
right by my side.

You were so precious to me.

But I always agonized

that I wasn't
enough for you.

BLACK WIDOW: I never realized
that you were in such pain.

I'm sorry, Elihas.

Have I made
a terrible mistake?

Do you remember
what you told me once,
a long time ago?

That more than anything,
you wanted to
be a hero for me?

It's not about power.

It's about always trying
to do the right thing,

no matter how challenging
that might be at the time.

You know?

And now I've
failed that challenge.

Right?

I still believe
in you, Elihas.

(HEAVY THUDDING)


There's a kill switch
for emergencies.

In case a security
exploit appeared

in the brainwashing program
of the bio-soldiers.

It's there to
prevent third parties
from controlling them.

Or worse, in the event
the buyers decided

to burn all evidence
of the transaction,

and mobilize
the bio-soldier forces
against Leviathan itself.

It was a hidden safety valve.

Orion, who is
in the auction room,
has that switch.

But you can't
just charge in.

All the buyers and
their security teams
are there, as well.

Sounds fun.

Would you be
willing to work with me
for old times' sake?


IRON MAN:
<i>Iron Man has arrived.</i>
<i>Please, hold your applause.</i>

What makes you think
anybody cares, Stark?

IRON MAN: (CHUCKLES)
What an explosive reception.
We must be at the right place.

I hope
we're not overdressed!


Oh, man!
Are we late?



Try not to get
yourself killed,
all right?

Aw! I lost the best
seat in the house!
Whoa!



Hey, Frank.
That makes us even
for Karachi!

Nice to see you're
still as pleasant
as you ever were.

And it's just as nice
to see that you're
still bulletproof, Stark.



Oh, boy.

Phew!


IRON MAN: Yeah,
I thought that might happen.

So I brought
your biggest fan.

Hulk hate Graviton!

IRON MAN: All right,
phase one complete.

Now, why won't
Orion come out to play?

(DISTANT GUNFIRE)

What is the meaning of this,

Elihas?


Really.
Is that the best you can do?

Stop it, Orion!

I am not gonna
let you do this!

Do you hear me?

I'm going to protect

those who are
important to me!

Hmm.

The fact of the matter is,
you're too late.

Our plans are so far advanced,

there's no way
you can stop us.

You are weak.
It is the strong
who will prevail!


The truth is clear!

There are only
winners and losers,
nothing more!

And we, as the winners,
will take back the power!

We will make the rules

and we'll be the ones
who carry out
their enforcement!

What a bunch of nonsense!
You're nothing
more than a terrorist!

A petty thug with
delusions of grandeur!


Let me ask you, Elihas.

What is it that
you're really
fighting for here?

In the long history
of our world,

the oppressors
who had the power
were ruthless!

The oppressed
were at their mercy!

You know what that's like.
You were weak,
and now you're strong!

Don't others deserve
to feel that power?

We can give that
power to the people!

Help us.
With your assistance, Elihas,
we can change the whole world.

Leviathan saved you.

In the end,
Leviathan will save us all

through the exercise
of real power!

ELIHAS: Shut up!

As I said before,

my eyes are open now!



Give up now.
You can't save this world.


So you say.

But I've got
news for you, pal.
We're sure as hell gonna try.

Hmm.

Idiots!






How dare you?

Now, Elihas!

Come on, the party was
just getting started!

(SIGHS HEAVILY)
So disappointing.

(GLASS SHATTERING)


(GUN COCKS)

I'm finally face to face
with the man who
started all this.

(BLASTER FIRING)

Don't do this, Frank!

It's time for you to
face your crimes, Mister.

Because of your weapons
many innocent
people have died!

Frank, don't!


No!

Elihas!


Satisfied with
your heroics now?

You were willing to
go through all this

and put your life
on the line to protect
just one woman?

You fool.

In the end,
you've sacrificed yourself
in vain, for no good reason.

Now you and
your grand gesture

will disappear altogether!

Tasha!

(GUN FIRES)

He was just deluded!


It was you,
you pulled his strings

and caused all this!


And for that,
you deserve to die.

I just wish I could
have been your hero.

I know that.

But in the end, you were.

And always will be.

Ta...

Sha...

FURY: I realize now,
Castle, it was a mistake

to pull you into this.
A big mistake.

We needed both
Orion and Elihas alive.

Their testimony was
critical in our efforts

to uncover everything
that Leviathan was up to.

At the very least,

we could have gotten Orion,

if you hadn't
ignored your orders
and killed him!

I don't work for you
or for S.H.I.E.L.D.

I operate on my own terms,
and I do what needs to
be done when you won't.

And I've got
a newsflash for you.
I really don't give a damn

if you like it or not!

Natasha, arrest him.

Excuse me?

What's wrong?
Didn't you hear me?
I said to arrest him!

You're accused of murder
and you face life in prison.

Director!

Frank!

Just do what you have to do.

That's how your justice works.
Right, Natasha?

Go ahead and
follow your rules.

You know I did
the right thing.

Some people needed to die.
I was just the executioner.

(HANDCUFFS CLICK)

FURY: It's your responsibility
to make sure he's
locked up, Natasha.

(HANDCUFFS CLICK)

You heard him,
it's my responsibility.

I hope you don't
escape by accident.

Sure about this?

Oh, yeah.

And why is that?

You do things your way,

I do things my way.

See you later, Frank.

Huh?

Where's Castle?


I just threw him
in the ocean.


Well, just between you and me,
I hope he never comes up.

It's been a pretty
tough few weeks,
sweetheart.

I tell you,
I'm physically and
mentally drained!

You know what they say,
no rest for the wicked.

But tonight,
nothing stops me
from having a good time.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)


(CAIN SIGHS)


Huh?

What the hell?

(GUN COCKS)
