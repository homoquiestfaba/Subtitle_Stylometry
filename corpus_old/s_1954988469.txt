They say when you stare death

* I can't explain this feeling
that I'm feeling **

'Hey, you've reached Megan's
phone. Please leave a message.'


Hey, Megan,
uh, I'm at the airport.

Um, just wanted to call
you before I go, you know...

I, I just wanted to let you
know that I agree with you.

I think, I think, I think
it's great that we're friends.

I think... I think you're totally

Totally right
and, um, I will see you soon.

Or... or you know, later.

Um, okay. Okay, yeah.
Uh, I gotta go, so, uh... bye.

'Please leave a message.'

If you, if you ever need me,
I, I'm still here.

I-I gotta go, bye.

If-if you don't need me, I...

Yeah, it's fine, you know.
It's all good.

We can still
be friends and I'll be here.

Give me a call.

You know, or-or you can text me.

Um, I-I check
my text messages a lot.

I, I will talk to you soon
or-or-or later.

Um, up to you.
Um, okay, bye.

[Instrumental music]

'Hey bro, what took
you so long?'

I had my grad party,
you know, but...

But things are,
things are okay.

I know. I know.
I'm just teasing you.

Are you sure everything's fine?

Yeah. Yeah.
Everything, everything's fine.

Um, don't worry.

Grace, I told you I'd be at your
wedding and... so I'm here.

Thanks, little bro.
It'll get better, I promise.

Mom and dad said to tell you
they're coming down tonight.

Uh-huh.

Cool.
Anyway, cheer up.

I'll see you soon, okay?
Okay. Love you, sis. Bye.

[Tires screeching]

Aloha, bro. Shaka.

Yeah, uh, Shaka.

I got it right here.
It's in my...

No, no, no. Shaka is Hawaiian
for hang loose, dude.

Oh, okay.
Hang loose, man.

Okay like chak-chakra.

Shaka-shakra.
Never mind.

Out here in Hawaii,
my name is James.

If you're cool, you
can call me Dreadlock James.

My bro can call me Dreadlock.
Don't call me Dreadlock, bro.

Okay.

(Male #1)
'Already got laid.'

(Male #2)
'I don't know,
we got tag teamed.'

Hey, excuse me.

What is this called?
It's a lei.

A lei? They give
that to you for free?

Yeah.
Really?

How much for some hand stuff
and mouth stuff?


'Really?'

What we need to be focusing on
while we're here is Maui Wowie.

Who else is coming out here?
Well, who cares?

Maui Wowie, bro.

That's what we're after.

(Male #2)
I'm with that.
I'm with that too.

'It is a weed. It is a weed.'

What the fuck is your deal?
Um, I'm sorry.

Uh, my bag's really heavy.
Yeah.

Dude, uh, Nikki's been here
for like a couple of now, right?

I don't care...

What?

You smell that?
Do you have pot?

Do you have weed?
'No.'

Who's got weed?

I bet it's the bus driver.

Guarantee he smokes.

Move. I'm trying to get by.

Super rude, dude.

Super rude.

'The fuck, right?'
I agree.

Dude, I'm sorry.
My buddy's a little drunk.

I mean, I am too.
But I'm not an asshole.

It's okay.

It's cool. Cool.

'Put on your seat belts.'

[Instrumental music]

God, my thingie is on fire.

Girl, I'm always on fire.

Tell me about it.
You're gay.

We're here less than 12 hours
and you've already gotten some.

Sometimes I really
wish I was gay. Ow!

What are you talking about?

My thingie!

I should have
gotten waxed in LA.

Could have slapped some
aloe on kitty cat.

Hey, I heard
Benjamin's already here.

Oh, God, I hate him.

I love him.
'Nikki! Augie!'

Hey!
Kevin!

Oh, my goodness gracious.
Oh, it's so good to see you.

Your sister's gonna be
so happy you're here.

Really? Yeah, I'm sorry
I'm late, uh...

I had my graduation
party yesterday.

You get drunk?
You get laid?

No, but I did play Cranium.

We stayed up
really late, till like 4 a.m.

But, um, I won
so it was totally worth it.

'Ooh.'
So smart.

'Yeah.'
'What up, pimp?'

[Instrumental music]

Dante!
Dant!

'Hey!'
'Oh, wow!'

Looking good. Who's this guy?

He's with you? Hey, dude,
what's your deal?

I don't have a deal.
I'm here for the wedding.

My wedding?
'Yeah.'

My wedding? Y-you're here
for my wedding?

Who the fuck invited this guy?

Um, my sister Grace,
she's getting married and, uh...

Grace has a brother?

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Grace never
told me she had a brother.

What the...
'I'm Grace's...

What else has she not told me?

I'm, uh, I don't know.

You know I'm just
fucking with you, right?

[Nikki laughing]

Dirty.
You're horrible.

Well, I, I got scared just now.

So tonight,
you're rollin' with me.

I-I-I can roll with you.
I love to roll. So I can...

No, no, no.
You are not rollin' with them.

You're coming with us,
to meet up with your sister.

You're going with
the girls tonight.

We're gonna do our nails.
Yeah.

Kevin, you're going to
the nails salon with the girls?

I can go...
You don't.

'Cause you're a man.
We'll roll with the boys.

You're rolling with me
and my boys tonight.

Have you met his boys?
'No.'

They are complete
and utter douchebags.

Jerk-faces. They are nimrods.

Dante! Dant...
What's up?

[Indistinct shouting]

Check it out.
The idiot from the bus.

What's up, idiot?
Hey.

Fellas, this is
Grace's brother Kevin.

Oh, hey, man.

Seriously,
it's nice to meet you.

'It's a pleasure.'
Nice to meet you too.

What's up, little brother?
I'm Dion. From the bus.

Hey, uh, you guys
all gonna dance tonight?

You know, get all dance on.

'Go partyin' in the club!'

Say "Chow, chow".

You know, get down
till the break of dawn.

I'm sorry, Ben. She-she
drank a little bit too much.

Come on. Let's go.
Your mom drank too much.

I know what you're saying.
I know what you're saying.

Hey, bro,
we made it to Hawaii.

So what's on the agenda?

It's my last 24 hours
before I get married...

Yes, it is.
Let's go hard!

'Whoo! We going in.'

We going in.
We going in. We going in.

'Kev, come on.
Grab your trunks.'

I'm okay. I gotta
check into my room...

Come on. Let's go!

[Instrumental music]

(Megan on phone)
'Hey, you've reached Megan's
phone. Please leave a message.'

'Hey, you've reached Megan's
phone. Please leave a message.'

Dude, this is awesome.
It is.

Yeah.
Titties.

I'm ahead of you.
What?

They look big from up here.
I know, right.

Welcome to the good life.
What are we talking about?

This is the view I always get.
I'm looking down on the titties.

What?
Yeah.

Y-you don't get this view

'Cause you're short as fuck.

For real? Really?

Ever thought I might be at the
perfect height for motorboating?

Actually I never thought about
that. That's a good point.

One point for the little guy.
One point!

Incoming.
What's this?

Come on. Pop it.

Are you sure?
Yeah.

Ah!

'Oh, man.'
Oh, no. Not the shirt!

I know I just
got this shirt too.

So I hear you got girl problems.

Yeah, well,
I had a girlfriend, but, uh...

But we broke up.

So tell me.
Did you break up with her?

Or did she break up with you?

Well, it was, it was mu...

Um, she broke up with me.

See, that's your first mistake.

You have to always
break up with them first.

Women only want
what they can't have.

Well, why would I break up
with her? I-I really liked her.

Exactly.

I'm confused.

Exactly!

That's how she
should be feeling.

Huh?
Huh?

Oh.
Right?

Right?
Right.

Okay. So, what do I do now?

What's her name?
Megan Richards.

Megan Richards?

Screw Megan Richards!

What?
Man, screw Megan Richards!

You're 18. Single... in Hawaii.

Huh?

Let's celebrate that. Cheers.

Pound it up.
Let's go! Bam! To the bottom.

[Upbeat music]

Hey!

Seriously?

Hey, cut that out, man.

I'm looking right at you.

I'm standing right there.

Uh, what? What?

I was, uh... I was just...

You were
taking pictures of me.

No, no, I was
taking pictures of...

Of the sights
and the, uh, birds.

Hey, it's not polite to take
pictures of other people.

I agree. I'm... I'm sorry. I...

I-I promise I'm not a creep or...

I'm like the opposite
of a creeper.

Oh, what's
the opposite of a creeper?

Uh... me?

Alright, um, what's your name,
opposite of a creeper?

I'm Kevin.

Kevin?

I'm Kat.

I think you owe me.

I owe you?
Yeah, you owe me a shot.

Alright.

Strike a pose. Come on.

Maybe something Hawaiian?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do something
Hawaiian. What's Hawaiian?

You, you tell me.
Uh, Shaka.

Okay, hold that.

That's perfect.

Okay.

Alright, Kevin,
I'll see you around.

I'll see you.
I'll be watching.

Watch where that
camera's pointing.

I'm not a creeper.

[Instrumental music]

So, I see you talking
to that girl on the beach.

No, she wasn't talkin' to me.

No?
'No.'

She was kind of cute.

'Yeah.'
I don't know.

It kinda looked
like you were talking.

What? No. We weren't talking.
We were just, uh...

You weren't talking?

We... we talked
for like a little bit.

That's what I'm talking about,
right there. You get the number?

No, I don't think
she was interested.

Ah, don't worry about it.

Your time will come.

But tonight... we're going in.

We're going in?
We're going in.

We're-we're going in?
We're going in.

We're going...
We're going in where?

You'll figure it out.
I have to check in...

[Indistinct shouting]

What? What the...

We're going in.
Dante! Dante!

Shit. That's kinda high.
It's okay, dude.

Come on. Let's do this.
No, I'm, uh... I'm okay.

No, no, no,
I know it sucks sometimes

But sometimes you just gotta...


[Dion screams]

[Instrumental music]

Kev, come on!

You sure
this is a good idea?

Close your legs,
don't be a pussy.

Like Dion.
What?

Um, I don't know, looks, uh,
looks a little dangerous.

It's not dangerous.

Nothing compared
to Spitting Cave.

'Yeah.'
What?

What's, uh,
what's Spitting Caves?

Don't worry about it. Come on,
Kev. You got to live a little.

Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm gonna
try and live a little...

'Um, up here.'

Just jump! Don't be a queer.
Come on!

Chill out, folks.

Kev, don't worry about it.
Don't jump if you don't wanna.

But tonight you're
gonna party with us.

Yeah, okay.

I'm down to party, I just...

(Ben and Dion)
Party! Party! Party!

Shush! Shush! Shush!

'Party!'

'Party! Party! Party!'

[Upbeat music]

[Music continues]

Oh, what's up, bro?

How's it? Yeah.

Hey, Dreadlock James,
what are you doing here?

Oh, local boys get
plenty of jobs.

Cool.
You know...

Shoots!

[Music continues]

Your boy's gonna
be in here tonight?

Yeah.
Okay, who do I look for?

[Instrumental music]

Look for the dude
with the blue track suit on.

Load up!

[Upbeat music]

Dante, I'm not 21.
I'm not 21.

Don't worry, I got you.

[Music continues]

'Dante.'

So, boys?
Boys night out.

'That's right, doll.'
Alright.

Well, what'll it be then?

I don't know.
Kev, what're you drinking?

I'll get like,
uh, uh, tap water

Or like, maybe some soda.

Bottle of Goose Patron.
All the mixings.

Four Cubans. Make it five.
One for you, doll.

Tonight we're celebrating.
Alright.

Sounds good.
I'll be right back.

* But she's rollin'
with the future *

* Future of the show
Couple of chicks on the sofa *

* One whippin' her hair

So, Kev,
you're having a good time?

Yeah, this is-this is awesome,
man. Thanks for having me.

You know what?
This may sound kinda random.

I think you'll look
really good in a suit.

No, no. I'm not
the suit type of guy.

What? Doesn't matter
what type of guy you are.

Sometimes you just
gotta wear a suit.

Come here. Get up.

Get up.
Okay, let me look at you.

Okay. First thing, you got
to undo your shirt, man.

Who taught you to do that?

My dad.
Okay.

Okay. Now, loosen this up.
Loosen this up.

Let this beautiful chest
breathe. Turn around.

Let the pant sag a little bit.

Dante, no.
There it is.

Feels like
it's falling off my ass...

Ass. Yes.

Nice ass. That's the first
thing girls look at.

That and then your shoes.

I don't think so.
Look at me.

The right cut suit
makes you look your best.

You look good,
you feel good

And when you feel good,
you stand out.

Here.

I don't know man.
There you go.

This is not...
I'm not the suit type of guy.

Ooh! Wow!
You look great.

Suzy.

Benjamin.
Hi.

Tonight's obviously a special
night for my boy over there.

Dante?
Yeah, Dante.

I was hoping that you could
make it a little more special.

You know what?
I don't need this.

I will make it very special.

Alright.
Okay.


[Upbeat music]

Hey. Kev, looking good.


So...

To my last night
of bachelorhood.

I wouldn't wanna spend it
with anyone other than my boys.

That includes you, Kev.

To great sex and paychecks.

(In unison)
Great sex!

Ooh!

Where's your ID?
Uh, my ID?

If you don't have your ID,
I'm kicking you out.

Kev, stop fuckin' around.
Show him your ID.

'Show him your ID, bro?'
'Come on.'

Okay.

[Music continues]

What the fuck
is Clements High School?

Clements High School,
it's uh...

Am I in trouble right now?

Look, kid.

You in trouble.

You know I'm fuckin' with you,
right? Right?

[All laughing]

That was hilarious.

He was just fuckin'...

Yeah we got you again.
How do you do it?

We always got Dion growin' up.
All the time.

No, not the prank.
How're you so cool all the time?

You just got to tell yourself,
I'm the man.

I'm... the man?
I'm the man!

I'm the man.

I'm the man!

I'm the man!

Yeah, we're gonna
work on that. Shots.

[Upbeat music]

[Music continues]

Man, I'm freakin' out.
I mean I love her.

I know I love her.
But I think it's a bad idea.

'No. Brother, no.
You just got cold feet.'

'Yeah.'
'Yeah.'

Put your shoes on. You got
a great girl. I'm jealous.

I'm jealous.
Or. Or.

It could be a bad idea.
Right.

One pussy for
the rest of your life.

That sounds like the worst idea
that ever existed.

That's what I'm saying.
'Okay.'

Have you both gone mental,
right now? Okay.

What'd you think's gonna happen
when you get married?

Think we can
roll there at 4?

We drink beer till we pass out.

I'm around the toilet,
I wake up in the morning.

I cook you blueberry pancakes.

My special Benny
blueberry pancakes.

Grace's not gonna do that.

She doesn't know you
put the blueberry at the end.

Your pancakes suck, dude.
Okay. You got to figure it out.

I do.
You've always been smarter.

I'm proud of you.

Marriage is for life, bro.

It's like herpes.

No! No!
'No.'

The herp dog!

No, it's not like herpes.

It's okay, it's okay.
It's all over.

It's not like herpes.
It's not.

No, he has herpes.
He's scaring me.

He's trying to give everybody
herpes. And it sucks, alright?

Ain't she the one, man?

I'm-I'm a winner.
I'm a winner.

You've always been a winner.
I'm winning.

You're like a rabbit.
You're that lucky rabbit.

Dan Cook over here
doesn't wanna lose his wingmen

Doesn't mean a damn thing.

Hey, Pacquiao.
Bruno Mars, Love Child.

Hey, everybody.
I have fucking herpes.

Yeah, guess why?
'Cause I get pussy.

You do?
Yes.

I do too.
You used to get pussy.

We were a dynamic duo.

We were.
Like Wham.

Like Wham.
"Wake me up before you go go."

Because we used
to spit-roast bitches.

We were bad.
We were awesome.

Dante, all I'm saying is,
there is a rule

That states, "You're allowed
to sleep with one stripper...

Before you throw
your whole life away."

I've read that.
It's not a rule.

That's a rule.
Ask Maria Lopez.

I don't know.
What.

Are you looking
for trouble, Dante?

I don't...
Uh...

I'll take a drink.
The champagne room, huh?

Yes, indeed.
Yeah.

Kev, where've you been?

I was, uh, in the bathroom.

Cool, man. We're going to the
champagne room. I almost forgot.

There'll be a guy here
in blue tracksuit.

Give this to him, okay.
What is this?

It's, uh,
invitation to the wedding.

He's a buddy of ours, okay.
Why don't you give it to him?

Because, Kev, I'm going
to the champagne room

To pick a stripper for Dante,
and I can't do everything.

So help me out
a little bit, pal.

Come here.

Kev.
So, are we done?

No.

How do you feel?
How are you feeling right now?

I'm-I'm a little drunk.

I'm a little drunk.

No way. You're okay.
I'm a little tipsy.

And we also have
two more beers left.

No.
For us.

And it's a race.
To the bottom.

No.
Yes.

We have to do this.

What'd you mean by race?
Are we suppose...

Oh. Go, go, go.

Chug. Chug, chug, chug.

He's beating you,
he's beating you.


Dante. I'm the man!

Yes.
I'm the man.

Whoo!
Whoo.

Yeah!

Watch out.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Watch out.

'Kevin's the man.'
'Shh! Blue tracksuit.'

'What?'
'The guy in the tracksuit.'

'What are you talking about?'

It's the guy
in the blue tracksuit.

I'm inviting him
to your wedding.

I'll be right back, Dante.

Hey.

You're invited.

So mean.
What is that?

It's a invitation
to my sister's wedding.

Why's there money in there?

Why is there money in there?

What the hell?
Hey, this guy is funny.

Give him the package.

'This is for me.'

Is this drugs?
Hey, put that away.


'Hey, this guy's a comedian.'

Hey, this here's
Maui Wowie. Okay.

Now enjoy it and get
the fuck out of here.


I'm not leaving.

I know what you're doing.
Hey. You heard the boss.

You guys are fucking with me.

Hey, Dante, you guys...
Are fucking with me, right?

What?

Yeah, they are.

Hey, look. Drugs.

Hey, what the fuck
is your problem?

I don't have a problem.

What's your problem?
What's your problem?

What's his problem?
He's got a pony tail.

Hey. What the fuck
is your problem?

Hey.
'What is your fucking... '

What is your problem?
Get the fuck out of here.

Dante, these guys
are messing with me.

You guys are...
You guys are...


No, Kev!

Stupid fucking kid.

Run.

[Upbeat music]

Kev, what do we do?

Back off. I'm calling 911.

Oh, yeah/
You're in big trouble man.

[Indistinct chatter]

Oh, shit!
Kev, I got this.

Oh, yeah?
Do we have a problem here?


Dante. Dante.

Dante.
Oh, shit.

Get up.

Get up.
Shut up.

Here you go, boss.

[Instrumental music]

Have you, yourself
ever had a macadamia nut pie?

What?

The macadamia nut
is native to Hawaii.

It only grows in Hawaii.

And it was discovered by
the locals over 300 years ago.

Its healing qualities
have been passed down

From generation to generation.

From the past 80 years
you people have exploited

The macadamia nut.

If I wanna buy
a macadamia nut pie

You know how much
it fucking costs me?

This really,
really pisses me off.

Wh-what do you mean,
you people?

Mainlanders.

You come to our island,
you exploit our nuts...

Now, I'm gonna exploit yours.


[Upbeat music]

Back to back.
This is awesome.

This sucks.
We're gonna die.

Extortion. Extortion.

'Oh, shit. Oh!'

[Firecrackers bursting]

Oh, shit.

Stop. Stop.

What are you doing?

[Upbeat music]

'No, no, no. No!'



My balls.

Hot, hot.
Heat, ouch.

I'm on fire.
I'm on fire.

My balls.
Oh, God.

I think-I think we just
exploded our balls and...

And-and I can never use
my junk again.

I've never used mine before.

I'm never gonna
be able to use it.

I'm getting married tomorrow and
Grace is gonna freakin' kill me.


Hold on. Hold on.

Oh, no. I can't feel anything.

Kev, I can't feel anything.

Look. I can't look.
No.

No.
No, look.

Kev, look for me please,
I need this favor.

No, I'm not looking.

Oh, we got to get
this checked out.

I swear to God, if I see
that guy I'm gonna kill him.


'Stay there, we'll be back.'
I love this place.

I love it.
It's paradise.

I love this country.
Dude.

Kevin and Dante are next.

Where are...
Kevin, Dante.

Yeah, where are they?
I can't see...

Hey, excuse me. Have you seen
a dude that look like me?

And a Asian guy who shouldn't be
here, 'cause he's young as hell?

Two guys were chased out
by two Samoans.

I think they got their
asses kicked outside.

Are you-are you serious?
Oh, shit!

Haole.
Haole, to you too.

'People are so friendly
in Hawaii.'

Okay, guys. Let's see 'em.

I don't know what to say.

Say. Say I can use it.

Say, I can still bear children.

Yeah, doc.
I wanna use mine too.

Oh, I know you do. Which is why
I'm gonna be straight forward.

Dante, you've experienced
a slight castration.

So, there maybe a tiny chance
that you could become sterile.

Oh!

And not just that.
What?

Say it, doc.
Spit it out of your mouth.

Your pubic hair
has been charred off.

Now, Kevin, you know,
luckily you have

A nice healthy set of balls.

And I don't see any evidences
of castration, but there is

Some minor burns around there.

If I were you, I'd get
some ice on those balls.

But, hey, guys.
I wouldn't worry about it.

You know, I mean,
everything is conjoined.

I think you guys
will be able to use 'em.

Great.
Okay.

Thanks.

[Upbeat music]

Suzy.
Dante.

Is my brother here
and the tall guy?

Are you okay?
Kinda.

Well, they just
ran out of here.

What? When?
Five minutes ago.

Ah, gee. Can I talk
to you for a second?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

Yeah. I just...
Sorry for the mess that we made.

You know, way stranger
things have happened

Than that, trust me.

But you know Kev's my-my
little brother-in-law, right.

And I wanna take him out
and show him a good time...

It's like the worst night ever.
Do you have any ideas?

Yeah it's early still. So, why
don't you take him to Bar 35?

You know where that's at?
Yeah. Well, I'm off.

So, I will take you guys.

Kev, we're going to Bar 35.

We were gonna
find the guys and go home.

Don't worry about
the guys.

This is an island,
we'll bump into 'em.

I'm super tired.
You know what?

I'm gonna show you
a good time. Let's go.

Let's go.
Let's go.

Let's go where?

Let's go.
You guys okay.

Yeah. We're alright.

[Upbeat music]

'What're you doing?'
'Try to get you to dance.'

'With you?'
'Yeah.'

'Come on.'
'Boogie a little bit.'

I think you should
dance with Kevin.

'Cause he can get down.
Oh, yeah.

Is it true?
No. It's not true.

Kevin, remember what I told you
about taking compliments?

And I saw you
at the strip club.

Bust a move one time.
Bust a move.

Okay.
Let's see it.

I'm telling you
I can't dance.

Come on.

Oh, yeah.
What is that?

Go, Kev. Go, Kev.

I gotta get him
to teach me that.

Don't hurt him.
Uh-oh.

Whoa! Watch out for that guy.

'There it is. Get sexy.'
'Oh, yeah.'

'Take it down. Down low.'
'Yeah.'

What?
Nothing.

Oh. Oh, the girl
from the beach.

I think she saw me dancing.
I know she did.

She's looking this way and
she's walking over to you now.

What do I do?
You don't do anything.

What?
Just be honest.

Hey, tourist. It's not polite
to stare. Remember?

I know, I know.
I'm-I'm sorry I just...

I just couldn't help myself
from staring.

Ahem, Suzy.
May I buy you a drink?

That sounds super fantastic.
Let's go, doll.

You look different.
You're all dressed up.

Yeah, I, um...
You know as they say.

The uh, the right cut suit
makes you look your best.

And when you look your best,
you feel good.

And then you stand
out more, so...

Well, you look good, tourist.

Thank you.
Yeah, um, my name's Kevin.

And uh, your name is, uh, Kat.

Kat, yeah.
I remember it.

Like a cat.
Like a kitty.

Yeah. Meow.
Like...

Like that.
That's a cat.

Um, you know, like purr.

No, no, no, like...


That's like a spider.
Yeah, I don't know.

That was uh...
Um...

Can I buy you
an alcoholic drink?

Uh, I'm okay.
Okay.

Yeah.
I don't really drink either.

Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

Me neither.
Me neither.

Come with me, Kevin.
I'm gonna show you something.

So, once a month they display
photographer's work here.

And um...
Ta-da.

'Kat, what is this?'
'What?'

Wh-what do you think.
It's my favorite.

I call it "The Tourist."

"The Tourist?"
Yeah, it's you.

Why did you put this here?
What? I like it.

You like it?
'What do you think?'

Look how cheesy I look.

No. I think you look good.

I mean the shirt and like...

I can't believe this is
your first impression of me.

Why? What was your
first impression of me?

Um. Honestly?
Yeah.

You were...

Um...
You were um...

You were the most beautiful
person that I've ever seen.

Uh, what does this...
What does this hand thing mean?

First of all, it's like this.

It's a Shaka.

Shaka?
Shaka. Yeah.

It's a way for
two people to connect.

I, um...

I...
What, Kevin?

I, uh... I need to pee.

I'll be right back.
Yeah.

Hey! Hey,
I'm-I'm taking a piss.

Yeah, and so am I. Scoot over.
I-I can but this is...

[Clears throat]
This is weird.

Yeah, this girl's
diggin' you right now.

I guess.
She's all on your junk now.

Your honesty thing is-is,
uh, is working.

All you've gotta
do is lean in.

Lean in?
Yeah, you...

Well, you've gotta wait for the
right moment and then you just...

Oh...
Lean in, huh?

Yeah, I guess.
Yes. Lean in.

Lean in.

Yo, yo, yo, yo, you just...

You just pissed on me.
I-I didn't...

I'm sorry
I didn't mean to...

Fuck!

You're crazy, man.
Dude, I'm-I'm sorry.

Oh! Whoa!
Oh, there you are.

Come outside with me.
Right now?

Right now. I need to go smoke.
Alright. Do your thing, Kev.

Alright. Hey, nice picture,
by the way, Kev.

It's not that nice.

Hey!
Hey!

So, uh... how was the bathroom?

It was, um, it was fun. I...
Yeah?

I've peed like eight times.
Whoa!

It's...
I've never drank before, so...

You never drank before? No?
No.

Yeah.
It's cool, I don't drink.

Yeah, that's cool. My girlfriend
doesn't drink either.

She's a Mormon, so...
Wait. You have a girlfriend?

Yeah. No-no! Wait, I-I don't
have a girlfriend.

She just broke up
with me, so...

Okay.

So, you-you do, you don't?

I-I don't.

Well, the doctor said that
everything was intact.

More or less.

Except I'm missing
a few pubes.

Well, nobody really
needs pubes.

Well...

Okay, are you at least gonna be
able to use it later?

You're a wild card.
I mean, what about tomorrow?

Tomorrow for your wife.

What?

'What?'

Give me a second.
What? Where are you going?

I know why she broke up.
Why?

Look at me.
You're a great guy, Kevin.

Don't-don't worry about her.

You need to just be in the
moment. Enjoy your time here.

Spent my high school with her.
It's just, maybe she just...

You got out of high school,
maybe she wants to start

A new chapter of her life.

You think? I don't know.
Yeah.

[Upbeat music]

Dant-Dante.

Hey! Yo, man.

Macadamia nuts, my ass!


No!

Get off of me! Get off me.

What are you doing?
Wh-what're you doing, man?

[Tires screeching]

Being single
is not that bad, okay?

Trust me.
What do you mean?

So, are you single?

Yeah, of course. I...
How are you single?

I...
Yeah, I have my reasons.

* I know you can't
come with me *

* You got your life

* He better be
treating you right **

Look!
Oh, God.

I told you.
This is exactly what we want.

Hello. Come on.

'What are you guys doing?'

'We're gonna extort you, brah.'

Wh-what?
Extortion.


Extortion?

Hey, do you wanna come
to this after-party

With me and my brothers?

Uh, no, not really.

Hmm, please?

Dante's supposed to be back.

And we should wait for him.

Come on, Kevin, he's fine.

It's his wedding.
I mean, he's probably gone home.

Yeah, I should
probably go home too.

I mean...
No. No. Just...

Come on. Just come
to this party with me.

No.
Just nod your head.

Nod it that way.
Oh!

Yeah. Yeah.
Okay. I'm nodding my head.

Wooh! Thanks, man.
Uh, hey, bro.

Have you seen
my girl up in here?

My girl?
What are you talking about?

No, I mean, it's like...

It's kinda like this girl that
I like and I think she likes me.

And so I...
Like?

Are you talking about Nikki?

Right now? Seriously?
Yeah, man.

I mean, like she's tall
and she's, like blonde.

And she's like...
Oh, my God!

You like a starfish.

I told you a hundred times
that chick is a starfish.

She lays there
while she takes it.

That's not cool, alright?
I doubt you've even got...

I doubt you even
slept with her, dude.

You doubting
my abilities?

You're doubting my abilities?
Yes, I am.

Hi. Hi!
Oh, hey!

Thank you guys so much
for calling us!

Love his dancing.
Yeah, come on.

Oh, I love his dancing.
Come on, yeah.

[Upbeat music]

[Instrumental music]

This isn't a party.
I know.

I just wanted to stop and show
you my favorite place.

Okay.
Come on.

* Why did it take so long
for me to realize *

* That you were there for me
the way I was for you *

* But those eyes
they captured me...*

What do you think?
It's uh, it's nice.

Yes, so the party we're gonna go
to is, um, it's over there.

'It's by this place
called the Spitting Caves.'

I've always wanted to jump off
the Spitting Caves actually.

Really?
Yeah, I, um...

I'm, uh...
It's pretty scary.

I think people
have really died.

That's why I've always
wanted to jump off it.

'Cause I'm really brave.
Well, I had no idea.

No, I'm kidding.
I'm actually really fragile.

Fragile's cool, too.

[Instrumental music]

Kevin, wait...
Wait.

Whoa!
I just...

I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

No, it's like...
No, I'm more sorry than you.

I should...
No, I...

We don't really know each other
that well and...

Yeah, I-I...
I agree.

I totally rushed it.
What...

I'm so sorry. We don't really
know each other.

You're right.
No, no, it's cool.

I mean, I'm-I'm the one who
brought you up here. Okay?

With, like this view and
everything and I, um...

I... I...

It's just, um, not fair.

What's not fair?

Um, let's just say, like...

Guys are scared
to hit on me.

What?
Here, yeah.

Why would they be scared to hit
on you? You're so nice.

No, I...
My family...

Is scary as shit.

Trust me.
They scare everyone away.

Especially boys.

They can't be that bad.
Yeah, they're pretty bad.

It's annoying.

Well... you should tell them.

Just be like...
"I'm Kat and I like boys."

And...
Just like that?

Just like that. You know, if
they love you, they'll listen.

Maybe you're right.

Maybe I'm...

* Oh oh oh oh oh...

They do love me.
They just...

They have a funny way
of showing it.

* But I'll say these words...

Come on, let's go.

* You're overplayed *


What're you guys doing?
You're hurting me.

What's going on?
Extortion, brah.

What? What you...
Shh.

I see somehow
you kept your nuts. Ha ha ha.

We're gonna
take them from you.

You're planning
to extort my nuts?

[Suzy screams]


'Extortion.'

I don't think
you know what it means.

And why do you keep
taking off my clothes?

Tie 'em before boss comes.
Shh.

Let's tie them up
before boss comes.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

[Both laugh]

You know, Dante,
you have a beautiful legs.


So, is there gonna be more
alcohol at this party?

Oh, yeah, probably.
I mean, yeah.

I'm...
So, we're just friends, right?

Yeah. Um...

Yeah.
Yeah.

'We're just friends.'
Okay, I just, um...

I don't wanna give
people the wrong idea.

Wouldn't want you to do that.
Okay, cool. I just...

Just checking. Come on.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

[Both grunting]

So, this is kinda weird, huh?

Okay. I think you
just need to relax.

Relax? We got kidnapped and
stripped down by a psychopath.

I know, but I think
things could be worse.

Worse? No.
This is the worst scenario.

I-I'm getting married tomorrow
and some...

Crazy dude wants
to take my balls!

Shh. All I'm saying is that
at least we're in this together.

Okay? Why don't we
just make the most of it?

Huh?


Suzy, what're you...
Suzy, what are you doing?

You heard me, I'm getting
married. Heard that, right?

I can tell that
you're getting turned on.

No, I'm not. I just...
I mean, yes, I'm but...

It's just scientific 'cause
it's skin on skin

Rubbing up against
each other.

I love my wife,
I can't wait to get married.

I love my wife,
Can't wait to get married.

'I love my wife!'

* I know this girl...

Uh-uh, uh-uh.

How's it? How's it?
Oh, my God. Hi.

Um... what's up?
Who's that guy?

I'm Kevin.
Nice to meet you.

Motherfucker,
you're wearing a suit?

Um... the, uh...

The right cut suit makes you
look your best, so...

When you look good,
you stand out.

And when you...
Brah, you stay in Hawaii.

You look like
one fucking tourist.

Kat, why did you bring
a tourist to the party for?

Okay, you guys hang out.
I'll be back.

* All the boys like the kid...

* Talk with a rhyme
but she can't, said stop *

* Wonder why she
don't like the attention *

* I know this girl she's so...*

'It's like, uh, okay.'

I mean, that's not really,
in the vein of party time.

But I guess, I don't know,
it was cool, man.

'He was like, a dude with
the flute in the corner.'

'Wait, you were, like, into
musicians for a while.'

Kat...
Oh, my God, Kev, okay.

This is Cassie.
Hi, I'm Cassie.

Hi, Cassie.
Yeah.

I've to get something
from inside the house.

You guys chit chat.
I'll be right back.

No, wait...
Kevin, right?

Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.

I have a puppy named Kevin.
He's so adorable.

Do you have a dog?

No, I don't have a dog.

Um, do you guys
have a phone I can borrow?

Oh, I don't. Sorry.

Thanks. Appreciate it.

[No audio]

Kat?

[Instrumental music]

[Door rattling]

Oh, gosh, uh, I'm sorry.

I did not mean to barge...
Kev!

D-Dante.

Hey, Kev!

Oh, God. Thank God
you're here. Come over.

I need some help.
Give me a hand.

Give you a hand?
No, I'm not giving you a hand.

No. This is not
what it looks like...

What are you...
You...

Calm down. Calm down.
You're a terrible person.

Kev!

Hey, Kev, wait,
where're you going?

I'm leaving.
Wait, what?

Come on. Let's just
hang out a little bit.

Hang-hang out?
You wanna hang out?

Yeah, I mean...
No, I'm a tourist, remember?

I'm leavin' in two days
and you won't have

To pretend you like me.

Kevin, I wasn't pretending.
Whatever, Kat.

Kevin, wait.

[Instrumental music]

Hey! Get your
hands off my sister.

'BJ.'

Kat, what the fuck are you
doing with this guy?

I wasn't thinking.
This guy is your brother?

You mess with me and now
you mess with my sister?

I'm really gonna fuck you up!
No, no.

'No need for that.'
No need for that.

'We're just hanging out.'
We're just hanging out.

This guy was tryin' to buy drugs
from me at the strip club today.

I don't want you hangin' out
with guys like this.

Wait. Kevin, you were tryin'
to buy drugs from him?

No, Kat, I've never
done drugs before.

Yeah? I thought
I blew your nuts off.

Wait...
You want some more?

What? BJ, come on,
the nuts thing? Really?

Kat...
Again?

I'm your brother.
Every time I like...

I'm lookin' out for you.
You're interfering. Why?

I'm lookin' out for you.
No!

Kat, shut the fuck up!
Hey!

You shouldn't talk to
your sister like that.

What'd you say?

I said that if you
love your sister...

Then you should
consider her feelings.

And, you know, she...
Don't tell me what to do.

Hey, okay, come on.
BJ, enough.

Stop.
Kat, get the fuck away!


Now, we're really
gonna have some fun.

[Both grunting]




BJ, let him go.

Kat, you're missing the fun.
Don't leave!

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Look at your boyfriend.
He's so sexy.

I-I didn't mean to do that.

I didn't mean to hurt you.
I didn't punch you that hard.


'You're an animal. Just like
a pig, little roasted pig.'

Now, it's starting to hurt now.

'BJ, I'm sorry.'

Ow! Ah!

'What are you doing?'

Look, I'm sorry, alright?

[Upbeat music]

What are you doing?
Get away from me.

Gettin' you untied.
What'd you think?

Get away from me.
I don't need your help.

[Music continues]

What is this?

Where the hell
did he come from?

Oh, shit.

Boss, we kidnapped them.
Kidnapped them? Why?

Untie me right now. What's
your problem? Untie me.

Why would you kidnap them?
Extortion, boss.

Yeah, extortion.
Extortion?

Yeah.
Do you know what that means?

No.
Extor...

You guys are idiots!

It's him.
Him!

Let's go. Let's go.

I, just...
Okay, okay.

[Music continues]

'Oh, shit! This is high.'
'Way to go, man.'

You got us trapped on the edge
of the Spitting Caves.

Me?
Yes, you!

I just saved you!
I could've run!

I saved your ass!
Surprised you did it.

You know why?
You're a man-whore!

A man-whore? I've been
tryin' to explain to you!

You two little fuckers!

You fuck with my house,
you fuck with my family.

Now, you're both fucked!

BJ.

Man, hold up, I think there's
a misunderstanding here.

I know that, you know...

I'm here with my brother-in-law
and we're having a good time.

And obviously
we pissed you off.

We pissed you off!
It's not our intent.

And I'm gonna be the first to be
the bigger man and apologize...

Shut up.
Don't apologize to this guy.

This guy is an asshole.
Kev-Kevin.

He doesn't deserve
to have a sister like this.

And everyone at this party,
they call me a tourist

And make fun of me.

All you guys are assholes.

This is the least fun
I've ever had at a party.

Kill these dudes.
No! No!

Kill them.

What are we gonna do?

[Dramatic music]

I'm the man.
'Kill them!'

What?

Kev!

Kev!

[Music continues]


'Those guys are crazy.'


Kev!
Fuck that. I wouldn't do that.

Kat, it's for your own good.
Okay?

'You're dead. Go suck on a
sea cucumber. You're dead!'

Kev! Kev!

'Kev!'

'Kev!'

Oh!

Oh, Kevin. Kevin!


Oh, Kev...
God!

Oh, thank God!

Whoo! Thank God!

What happened?
We're still good.

Thank God, you're okay.
Where are we?

You, you just jumped from...

Spitting Caves.
You called BJ an asshole.

Whoo! You're crazy.
You're crazy.

You're crazy.
Ouch! Ow!

You had sex with a stripper.
No...

You had sex with a stripper.
No, no.

I did not have sex with Suzy.

And she's not a stripper,
she's a waitress.

She's a waitress,
it doesn't matter.

Why do you keep
throwing stuff at me?

Why do I? 'Cause I wanna
hurt you. I wanna hurt you.

S-stop it. Stop it.
'Don't throw stuff at me.'

You can't throw stuff at me
'cause you're the man-whore.

I'm not a man-whore.
You're a man-whore.

This whole night was all
a set-up, you take me out.

You take me to strip club,
I almost get my balls blown off.

I almost got my balls
blown off, too.

Oh, your balls.
I don't care about your balls.

I wish they got blown off so you
won't flirt with Suzy all night.

You know what, whatever.
How can you have cold feet?

Yeah, whatever, you don't even
know what you're talking

About right now. You've
everything ass-backwards.

Ass-backwards. Your ass...
'Ow!'

Your ass abandoned me.
I did not abandon you.

I was outside the bar, and I got
kidnapped by the two henchmen.

Yeah, kidnapped.

They threw me in the back
of a van like a terrorist

And then they stripped me
again, me and Suzy.

They tied us in some weird
sexual position.

Alright, so you got kidnapped
outside the bar.

Yes, yes, the two crazy, scary,
Samoan henchmen kidnapped me.

Ah!

So those crazy guys tied you up
and took off your clothes again?

Yes, that's what I've been
trying to tell you.

Why-why do they keep
taking off your clothes?

Be...
I don't know.

I don't have any clue
why those big Samoan dudes

Want to see me
in my underwear, man.


What's that about? God!

I am so sorry,
I just wanted to take you out

And show you a good time,
and I totally screwed up.

Don't be sorry, man.

This whole night...

It's like a,
it's like a sign.

'Like a bad sign
for my wedding.'

A bad sign?

I mean,
maybe Benjamin's right.

Maybe I have cold feet.

I mean,
the whole Suzy thing.

I mean,
I almost got you killed.

Did you sleep with Suzy?
No.

Could you have slept with Suzy?

Yes, definitely.

But you didn't, right?
Right.

And why didn't you sleep
with Suzy?

B-because I...
Be-because...

Oh!

We gotta get back.

[Instrumental music]

[Both grunting]

Oh, my God!


It's too steep.

We gotta find another way.

That way.

Oh, man.


I gotta get back.

I gotta get back.


Is that Dreadlock?

Dreadlock James.

Oh, hey, guys.

What are you doing here?
Yoga.

I'm-I'm so glad
to see you right now.

You know I'm getting
married today, right?

Congratulations, man.
My parents are married.

Awesome, man.

We need to get back
to the hotel right now.

We need to get back
to the wedding.

No worries, brah.
I know a shortcut. We go.

[Dante and Kevin screaming]

[Instrumental music]

Whoo!

Whoo hoo hoo!

We're flying.

We are flying.

We are flying.

We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it.

Oh, I got this.
I got this.

Whoo!

Oh!
No, no, Dante.

'Dante, I don't,
I don't wanna die.'

Don't drop us now.


Whoo!

'Hey, let's land in here.'
'Whoo!'

Let's land.
Dante, let's land.

'Dante?'
'Huh?'

'You're the pi...
Land it.'

Land it?
Yeah, la-land this...

Let's go.
What?

Dante! Aah!
Aah!

Dante! Dante!


[Upbeat music]

Oh, my God! You're okay.

I'm okay. I missed you.

I was so worried about you.
Don't be worried, I...

Wow, why are you wet?
'I, uh, was in the ocean.'

'And we-we went for a swim... '
Your clothes, why-why...

Grace, I'm here.
We made it.

Let's-let's get married.
Let's do this.

Whoo!

Get married?

Where has everyone been, huh?

No, this is not good.

I have been on the verge
of canceling this wedding.

No. Cancel?
Why would you do that?

Dante, I don't know
what's going on.

I don't even know
where you were last night.

Last night...
Yes.

We were at a bar.

We-we had a few drinks.
Drinks.

We-we were, we were partying.
We were partying.

We-we were dancing.
And dancing. It was fun.

Really?
I got a call from Nikki

And she said that you got
in a fight at a strip club.

Why would she tell you that?
You are crazy.

You could have gotten
yourself killed.

I mean, we could have
but, you know...

We didn't.

What?

Dante.
Grace.

You were supposed
to be the responsible one.

No, you can't even take care
of my little baby brother.

Grace, I was...
He did take care of me, Grace.

It's just, we weren't together
the whole night, so when...

Kevin.
What?

Dante, I have been
looking forward

To this day with you
for so long.

And now,
you've completely ruined it.

I don't think
I can do this anymore.

I'm sorry.

Grace.
Wh...

I'm-I'm sorry, man.
I-I messed...

No, no, it's not, no,
it's not, it's not your fault.

It's me.
I...

It's just, Grace doesn't
trust me anymore.

Well, you gotta get her
to trust you again. You have to.

I'm not telling her
about last night. Are you crazy?

Just be honest.
What?

Don't do anything...

But be honest.

Uh, Grace.


Grace, I'm not proud
of what happened last night.

We, I mean,
your brother and I...

We got chased out
of a strip club to the streets

Of China Town
by these gangsters.

I mean, drug dealers.
They were drug dealers.

They did drugs.
We got into a fight with...

Samoan dudes.
Two Samoan dudes.

And we lost.

I got,
I got a goos punched in.

And then, they-they made us
jump off this 80-foot cliff.

And, and we nearly got
our balls blown off.

I, myself ended up
slightly castrated.

What?
Don't worry.

My balls are okay.
'Mine, too.'

We're, they're...

Conjoined.

That's what
the doctor told us.

So, but being that I almost
got my balls blown off

I realize that
I take you for granted, and...

Hold that,
you're telling me

You put Kevin
through all of this...

I know it sounds crazy.

But I was just trying
to show him a good time.

Show Kevin a good time? My God!
You almost got him killed.

What is wrong with you?
I was...

Grace, I...

I did almost get killed.

But I would never
take it back.

Last night was the greatest
night ever. I, I wore suit.

I-I kissed a girl.

I freaking jumped off
Spitting Caves.

It was, it was scary.

But he taught me so much
about myself, and...

Grace, I'm gonna be sad
if you don't marry him, 'cause...

Then I can't call
Dante my brother.

Babe, after last night,
I have no doubt in my mind

That I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

The next time you go out
on an adventure...

You better not leave me out.

"When We Say"]

* Something about the way

* Something about the way
you look in my eyes *

* You make everything
so damn easy *

* So easy that
I don't got to worry *

* About a thing

* And baby when we touch

* All I can see
is the image of us *

* Sitting by the ocean
just before the dusk *

* Sippin' on a juice box
with sand between our toes **

Hey!

Hey.
What are you doing?

I'm, uh, I'm here
for my sister's wedding.

Look, what you did
to my fucking eye?

I'm so sorry, yeah, I was,
it was like in the moment.

Yeah, well,
I got something for you.

Is this a macadamia nut pie?

Yeah, it's the best
fucking macadamia nut pie

In the island.
My tut made it for me.

This is, this is really good.

I respect you, man.

You jumped off
the Spitting Caves.

You punched me
in the fucking face.

It takes some fucking nuts
to do that, man.

I like that.
I'm-I'm glad you like that.

I-I guess it takes nuts
to do that, I appreciate...

Yeah, why don't you get your
fucking hands off my sister?


Why don't you get your
fucking hands off my sister?

Yeah, no, I wasn't,
I wasn't touching her.

Seriously.

[Instrumental music]

He's really confusing, I...
Yeah, he's crazy.

[Both laughing]

Dante, I wanna apologize, man.

I feel like last night
was all my fault.

I also feel like last night
was all your fault.

Look...
It's okay.

We're cavemen.
We come from the same tribe.

Every now and then,
we wild out, but please

Don't ever bring this
upon Grace ever?

Okay.
Ever.

Okay. Hey, I heard you almost
blew your dick off last night.

Ah, true story.
Really?

Dude, you need to respect
that one vagina

For the rest
of your life. Okay?

Also, how do I tell Dion
that he might have herpes?

I'm just trying to be honest.
That's my new thing.

Kev.
'Hey.'

Everyone, can I, um,
can I say toast?

Toast away.
This is Kevin, everybody.

Thank you. I just wanna address
the bride and groom real quick.

Grace, you are the most
considerate, beautiful

Amazing, big sister
that I could ever ask for.

And... I love you.

Awww!

Wait, wait. Dante?
Yes.

You are the most reckless,
egotistical

Irrational individual
that I've ever met.

And, um, cheers.

You know I'm just
fucking with you, right?

Kevin, don't use
that kind of language.

Dad, sorry.
I-I'll watch my language.

'Let me, let me finish.
I'm not done.'

Dante, you're actually
like the cool, older brother

That I've always wished
I had and...

In the spirit of Hawaii,
Shaka.

Shaka!

Cheers!

[Instrumental music]

Kev, you're the man.

Me?
You're the man.

I'm the man.
You're the man.

I'm the man.

I'm the man.

[AJ Rafael singing
"We Could Happen"]

* I'll hold the door
please come in *

* And just sit here
for a while *

* This is my way of telling you
I need you in my life *

* It's so cold
without your touch *

* I've been dreaming
way too much *

* Can we just turn this
into reality *

* 'Cause I've been thinking
about you lately *

* Maybe you could save me

Marker.

I'm sorry, I, I didn't mean
to mess things up.

No, it's not your fault.


'Damn!'
We'll get some penis.

'Yes!'


'Marker.'

You know, I-I would get
some ice on those balls.

But I wouldn't worry too much.

'You know, just keep them
propped up.'

Are the nurses working
at this time of the evening

To help ice my balls?


'That's the one. Sure you'll
get that. And action.'




'Cause you're the only girl
I've ever loved.

And first and, I...

Oh, shut up.

[Both laughing]

Look, I know it sucks
but sometimes

You just gotta
go with it. Aah!

Dion.

I don't wanna calm down
right now.

'You-you treat your sister
like shit.'

You treat the world like shit.

That's why your face
looks like shit.

I'm like,
not that good-looking.

Kevin, stop...
I'm wearing a suit.

Look how dorky I am...
You look awesome.

No, I'm freaking...
Kevin, Kevin...

You know who's cool?
You're awesome...

My brother, Dante, he's cool.
No...

I'm...
No, that guy, no.

You're way cooler than he is.
No, I'm not...

Seriously, no, I...
No, trust me...

Kev!

'Okay, good. One last one
for safety. Ready, and action.'

Kev!

'But your house sucks.
Your party sucks.'

My house is the shit.
Look at it.

It's worth ten million dollars,
you piece of shit.

I love my wife.
I can't wait to get married.

I love my wife. I can't wait
to get married. I love my wife!

Dante!

[Both screaming]

'And cut.
Good, got that.'

* 'Cause I've been thinking
about you lately *

* Maybe you could save me

* From this crazy world
we live in *

* And I know we could happen

* 'Cause you know that
I've been feeling you **
