[crow cawing in distance]

[rooster crowing]


Easy, now.

Take it easy.


Ooh-whee, look at that

horse go.

What you got there, Gordo?

Ho! Look at that time.

Now that is a solid little

so-and-so.

Danny...

What you doing there,

you little track rat?

Nothing, Solly.

Seen my Uncle Eddie anywhere?

I'm willing to bet he's

over there at the barn

doing a little voodoo hoodoo on

that hard-luck horse of yours.

Thanks.

Now, you see your uncle,

you tell him to call me.

I got some business to discuss

with him, some good business.

You got it!

Hi, Danny.

Hi, Beth.

Morning, Danny.

Hi, John.

Gentlemen, and lady,

I present Manifest Wind,

the pride of our

three-year-olds.


Can we get one with y'all

and Manifest Wind?

Certainly.

See?

Right there.

I want to thank all of you

for coming out, and we will

see you this afternoon at

the races.

Mrs. Slauson, could he be

a contender for the

Tucker Stakes?

We'll see.

Harland, is he ready?

And I mean really ready.

I can't afford mistakes

this season.

Mrs. Slauson, I would stake

my career on it.

Oh, Harland, let's hope

it doesn't come to that.

See you in the paddock

this afternoon.

[engine starts, revs]

So, how's he doing, Charlie?

He's still pretty swollen.

Hey, Eddie.

Hey, Danny.

Not off to school yet?

I'm getting there.

Gotta see Mooney first.

Can't that guy do his own

spying around the track?

Big Solly said he needs

to talk to you.

Yeah?

He say what about?

I don't know.

Good business, he said.

Well, good.

We could use some good business.

Think ol' Mr. How Do You Do

has a chance today?

Absolutely.

If it rains.

Great.

What ya got?

Figure it out for yourself.

You sure about these times?

Ever known me to be wrong?

Don't spend it all

in one place, okay?

Say, what do you know about

a horse named Manifest Wind?

Slauson bred, MacVie trained.

Royal blood on both sides

of the family, probably a

contender for the Tucker Stakes.

They were parading him in

front of the press this morning.

Yeah, he's running in the

seventh today, first race ever.

They trained him off track.


race with a ten-foot pole.

He looked pretty good.

Yeah, well, looks ain't

everything.

I guess.

Would you mind?

Give it here.

Five for the #2 horse

to win in the first.

Five for the #4 in the second,

but only if it's over 7/2.

And... and...

And?

And ten for Manifest Wind

in the seventh.

A hunch bet?

A hunch bet?


I thought I taught you better.

Sometimes I--

Well, sometimes is never when

you're betting without stats.

It's your money.

I'll pick the rest up

after school.

Thanks, Mooney.

A hunch bet.

Unbelievable.

 The flag is up...

[gate bell ringing]

 ...and they're off!

 Mud Dog in the lead,

 followed by Wolf Creek.

 Mud Dog and Wolf Creek continue

 to battle for the lead.

 Manifest Wind is just further

 back, then Rambling Rocket.

 Running on hydrosphere

 are the field, and they've run

 to the top of the turn.

[crowd cheering]

 The number two horse,

 Manifest Wind, breaks away

 from the pack,

 down the final stretch

 to take the lead.

 Wolf Creek tries to stay

 with him, but Manifest Wind

 heads for the wire!

 A length down lays the head

 of Wolf Creek.

 Manifest Wind's going to win

 this race by a length.

 Mud Dog and Wolf Creek

 second and third.

Manifest Wind, a fine young

prospect from one of racing's

best-known stables.

 Now in the winner's circle

 is Manifest Wind.

Ha, a hunch bet.

Who'd you have to win here?

Who else? Manifest Wind.

Don't you have all the luck?

I know my horses, Eddie.

Yeah, well, I'll go check

on our horses and clean up.

I'll meet you at home.

Great race, Mrs. Slauson.

Oh, why, thank you, dear.

I had him to win, too.

You did?

He took the first pole

like a champ.

But didn't you think he slowed

down in the last stretch?

Harland, this young girl

wants your job.

Well, from the mouths

of babes...

You got lucky this time, kid.

Mooney.

Just remember, all hunch

players die broke.

I'll see you in the morning.

Gotta be honest, Pop,

this is not the season for

two-year-olds.

Eddie's having a tough time

finding any to condition.

All the big barns seem to be

buying the promising youngsters

at the auctions.

We're trying our best.

What can you do with just

a couple of broken-down horses?

I'm concentrating more on my

handicapping...

which I know you wouldn't

approve of, Mama, but how else

can we make ends meet?

[door creaking]

Hey Danny, loan me a 20, huh?

Sorry, I don't got.

I've seen your winnings.

Empty, see?

What about that one

right there?

Our savings, Eddie?

Come on, just 'til tomorrow.

Look, if we're ever going to

get ahead, we have to follow

our budget--

Yeah, yeah, yeah, just give--

Absolutely, positively not

the savings.

You know what your trouble

is?

You're too old for your age.

Gonna be a late night.

Nah, I got that meeting in

the morning with Cornell Baynes.

The big shot old Solly

trains for?

Yep.

That's what he wanted

to talk about?

Yeah.

And you're going out tonight?

Just a couple of beers

with the guys.

Nothing doing.

A meeting like that, you need

a good night's rest.

Hey, who's the adult here

anyway?

â™ªâ™ª

Don't you worry.

Eddie and me, we're doing okay.

Solly here tells me you've

got the magic touch, Eddie.

That so?

I-- I don't know about magic.

I admired your brother

very much.

One fine horseman.

John was the best.

He trained Wild Wonder,

am I right?

Yes, sir.

Oh, what a horse.

What a horse!

He would've beat 'em all

in the Tucker Stakes

if he'd had the chance.

Oh, terrible tragedy,

that car wreck.

John and Molly, they were

good people.

They had a little girl.

Uh, Danny.

Danielle.

Well, to business.

Eddie, I grabbed a little filly

at auction last summer.

Good price, good blood.

Now, she don't do much

in the morning.

She's a real loafer.

And Solly doesn't have time

to mess with the horse,

so we, uh, you know...

We figure we're gonna take

her out of state, run her in one

of them little tracks,

show she can win.

Then bring her back in,

sell her off real fast.

I told Mr. Baynes Eddie

Fortuna's the man for that job.

Well, I'm-- I'm flattered.

I told Mr. Baynes, "I don't

know how he do it but he do it."


This life is fit to kill

a man.

I've been rubbing horses so long

I forget there's a world

out there.

Why don't you just get

your trainer's license?

Oh, yeah, I can show these

yahoos a few tricks they ain't

dreamed of.

But, I'm just a backstretch

stable bum.

Nothing more, and nobody's

gonna change it.

Besides, you need a horse

before you can train it.

But, I got me this dream, see?

Been saving my money,

get me out of this place.

You know, Florida, California--

somewhere where it doesn't snow.

I'm gonna have my own place

and be my own boss.

And if somebody come into my

place showing me attitude,

well, I just show them the door

with the business end of my

Buster Brown.

I got a dream, too.

I hope so.

What's this world

without dreaming?

I keep dreaming about

this house.

Not a fancy house,

just a house with real plumbing,

fireplace, some wall-to-wall

carpeting.

A little white picket fence

all around.

Well, that sound like a

wonderful house.

Yep.

One horse could do it, Gerald.

One great horse is all Eddie

and I need.

Then we'd own a dozen champions.

People would come from all over

the world, just to bid on a

Fortuna yearling.

Sound like a mighty

reasonable dream.

No reason it can't come true.

Yeah, well, it's not gonna

come true with Mr. How Do You Do

hobbling around the track,

that's for sure.

That bad, huh?

You don't want to know.

Hmm.

Eddie said if things get

any worse I may have to go live

with my old Grandma Temple.

That a bad thing?

I'd rather be boiled in oil.

I'm saving up money and soon

I'll be old enough to get

a real job.

Yeah, things'll work out.

All you need is a little luck

and a little magic.

Magic?

You mean, like all that stuff

in fairy tale books like

wishing on a star?

That's the very thing

I'm talking about.

That stuff's for babies.

Babies, huh?


I can tell I've got some

educating to do.

Now, grab hold of this wood

and say after me:

Rub on wood, sure to come good.

This is silly.

Don't silly me, now.

Just grab hold.

I'm gonna get splinters.

No, you won't either.

Now just grab hold like I said.

Come on.

Now close your eyes, this is

the important part, all right?

Rub on wood, sure to come--

You need to be saying this

with me, okay?

All right.

You ready?

Okay.

Rub on wood,

sure to come good.

Rub on wood, sure to come good.

Yes, there you go, Danny.

You're a natural at rubbing

that wood.

[whip cracks, man groans]

[horse whinnying]

[yelling, indistinct]

They're gonna kill that horse

before he win his first race.

[horse whinnies, whip cracks]

Who's that?

That horse is named

Tom Thumb.


He's beautiful.


Not a big horse.

No, not a big horse.

MacVie training him?

For Slauson Farms over there.

If they don't kill him first.

â™ªâ™ª

[thump; horse neighing]

Hi there, Tom Thumb.

[horse whinnying]

Hello.

Hello.

Hello.

You're not so bad, are you, boy,

hmm?

Hmm?

You're a good boy.


Oh, do you want the piece of

apple in my pocket, hmm?


That's what you wanted.

Hmm? You're a good boy.

What do you want?

What do you want?

You can't eat my jacket.

You're a good boy.

Wow.

You've got some family tree,

Tom.

I got news.

Me too.

Mine's better.

Yeah, well, see that filly

over there tripping over

her own hooves?

Yeah.

We are training that filly

for Cornell Baynes.

What do you think of

them apples?

Not bad.

Yeah? Top me.

I just came across the horse

that'll set us up for life.

Hey, Charlie!

Danny here's got a horse gonna

take us straight to the money.

Never have to worry about

anything again.

What's that, boss?


I'm serious, you.

This horse is perfect for us.

His name's Tom Thumb.

His father was none other than

Keltic Tom.

Keltic Tom?

And this boy got the same

spirit.

And where is this son of

Keltic Tom that's ours

for the asking?

Slauson Farms.

Oh, of course, and Harland

MacVie's just gonna hand him

right over and Mrs. Slauson's

gonna sign the papers.

Just because I'm 11, Eddie,

doesn't mean you have to treat

me like I'm stupid.

I'm telling you.

There's a shot they might try

to dump him.

Says who?

He's got some problems.

They're having a tough time

with him.

Well, if Harland MacVie

can't handle the horse,

I sure don't want him.

I bet we could make them

an offer, I bet--

Wait a second, aren't you

the one who's always lecturing

me about saving money?

This is different.

How is it different?

It's business.

No, this is our business.

I'm gonna take this filly

upstate, win her a race,

bring her back down,

then I'm gonna hand her over

to Big Solly, bing, bang, boom.

Pocket full of change that'll

take care of that stack of

unpaid bills in our closet.

Inside, work her closer.

She don't want to run

this morning, boss.

We could borrow the money.

Well, of course she don't

want to go, she's spoiled

rotten.

He's gotta make her go.

Danny, nobody's gonna loan us

a dime with my credit.

Come on, Sid!

Give her her head.

Yeah, that's better.

[country music playing]

I bet I could win enough

to buy Tom.

If I had a stake.

And if pigs had wings

they could fly.

Next subject.

If you could just take a look

at him.

Oh, come on, Squirt.

You're forgetting one very

important fact--

the horse isn't for sale.

Yeah, but--

Have you heard the horse

is for sale?

No, but you--

I haven't heard the horse

is for sale.

The horse isn't for sale.

Eddie--

And even if the horse was

for sale, I wouldn't buy it.

Because if Slauson Farms is

selling that horse on the open

market it's because its teeth

are falling out or it's blind

in one eye.

People like that don't sell

horses to people like us.

You drive me crazy.

Likewise.

Nice rig.

I'll tell Mr. Baynes

you approve.

She's all set, boss.

Great, thanks.

Now Charlie's gonna be taking

care of the barn.

I talked to the market about

extending our credit till I

get back, so anything you need

you get.

Now, Mrs. Crane's gonna stay

with you, so you listen to her,

all right?

I'll be fine.

All right, and you've got

my number in case you need

to reach me, okay?

All right, Danny, what is it

about this horse?

It was like, I don't know,

magic or something.

Eddie, you know me.

I don't go in for all that

storybook "kiss a frog,

get a prince" kind of thing,

but this was different.

Different?

Real different.

He looked at me.

I mean, really looked at me,

and I knew, just knew,

we were meant to be.

Look, I know it sounds stupid,

you don't have to tell me.

Hey, will you listen?

It doesn't sound stupid.

Really?

Really.

When I get back, maybe we'll

take a look at him, all right?

Yeah.

No promises.

No promises.

It's a deal.

Be good.

Be good.

And don't forget your

homework.

â™ª Rub on wood 

â™ª Sure to come good 

â™ª Rub on wood 

â™ª Sure to come good 

â™ª Rub on wood 

â™ª Sure to come good 

â™ª Rub on... 

Heya, Tom.

Tom?

[horse whinnies]

Come on, you!

Come on, hyah!

Get in the wagon. Hey!

Come on!

Come on in, you little devil.

Come on!

Easy.

Whoa, whoa!

Hyah! Come on, get in there.

Get, get!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Come on!


Switch him out!

Come on!

Watch it, watch it!

Get him out of here.

That's it, go on, get!

Come on, let's get him up

and let's get him out.

Boy, that's one horse I'm glad

to see shipping out of here.

Hard-headed little devil.

â™ªâ™ª

Gillespie Field?

Why would somebody want to ship

a horse there?

Miracles happen at Gillespie

Field.

Horses that couldn't get a

diploma on the fair circuit

magically win a race there.

Gee, maybe it's the weather.

I looked it up.

All they had was claiming races

there.

Only no horses ever get

claimed.

And if they do, they're back in

the original owner's barn

within a week.

Ooh, spooky.

How exactly does a claiming

race work anyway?

Well, simple.

When you're starting a horse out

you want to put him in a

low-level race, like a claiming

race, so it's easier for him

to get a win.

But there is risk involved

because anybody can buy the

horse whether you want to sell

him or not.

Anyone can claim any horse

in the race?

Sure, although there is

risk there, too, because you

have to put the money up for

the horse before the race,

and no matter what happens out

of the gate, you own the horse.

Like if he falls down

and gets hurt?

Even if he breaks a leg.

Of course.

Thanks, Mooney.

You've been a big help.

Sure, anytime.

See you.

Do you know who that is?

Moe White.

Moe White, back in town, huh?

Great.

That is just great.

How does he do it, Mooney?

He's the highest of the high

rollers.

He never seems to lose.

Simple, he's from another

planet.

They beam him down here,

he makes a pile of dough, enough

to balance the budget of

Alpha Centauri, and then zip!

Whoosh! They beam up back up

again.

Seriously, Mooney.

Seriously?

Seriously I haven't got

the slightest idea how he picks

his horses.

All I know is that he seems to

win a lot more than he loses.

He doesn't, like, do any

monkey business or anything?

No, no, he's just a smart

player and I hate him for it.

See, guys like Moe White,

they twist the vibes and tweak

the odds.

Gives me the heebie-jeebies

just thinking about it.

So, uh, we're talking

the 4 horse here, huh?

Mm-hmm.

Well, excuse me, my little

doll.

Sorry, mister.

Mooney, do me a favor.

It's not the best of times,

kid.

Got the scoop from Moe White.

And?

Win.

Place.

No, no, all to win

on the 4 horse.

You're crazy.

I'm telling you.

Win on the 4 horse.

It's your dough.

â™ªâ™ª

 Now here comes Pancho Verde.

 Pancho Verde coming right up

 along with him...

 Pancho Verde!

 A long shot beats to show

 at the wire.

 Pancho Verde.

â™ªâ™ª

Race number three is the first

of the Pick Six races.

 Races three through eight,

 your Pick Six.

Pick Six?

Are you bonkers?

I hope not.

 Around the final turn,

 Outrageous Ollie, Bombay Boomer

 pull away now Wicked comes hot.

 Outrageous Ollie first,

 Bombay Boomer stays with him.

Down the stretch, Outrageous

Ollie, of Bombay Boomer.

It's gonna be Outrageous Ollie.

 [call continues, indistinct]

It's gonna be Middle Child.

From out of it here comes

Certainly May.

Certainly May, come on down

 the stretch moving out,

 now takes the lead by a head,

 now by a full length.

 It's gonna be Certainly May

 right at the wire.

Good riddance.

I could have used a couple

more days like today.

I'm still short.

All right.

I'm glad he's gone.

You be sure to give her

mash tonight, Gerald,

'cause she done good.

Oh, Solly was right, Eddie.

You do have a special way.

Well, she just needed some

attention and proper shoeing.


Isn't he modest?

A little something for your

trouble, Eddie.

Meet me at the Turf Club

someday, I'll buy you a drink.

Baynes is pleased.

I told you this would be

a cinch.

Thanks for the help, Solly.

I owe you one.

Hey, now, all I did was

give you the opportunity.

Just like I'd done with your

brother John.

Little nudge here, little

schmooze there, but Johnny

did the work.

John was the best, wasn't he?

Now, don't you sell

yourself short, Eddie.

You know these horses like

you was one of 'em.

Now I'll tell you something--

Baynes seen what you done

with that hard luck case.

Next time the right opportunity

comes up, Big Solly gonna make

sure you are in.

Thanks, Solly.

Thanks.

Doggone it!

I'm gone one week, I got two

horses: one's got the cough,

the other needs a dentist.

Doc says a lot of that

going around, Eddie.

Oh, great, that's just great.

And the feed guy says

he's not making another delivery

until he gets paid.

Well, easy come, easy go.

What else?

I gotta leave you.

I got an offer I can't

turn down.

From who?

Harland MacVie's barn.

Harland MacVie.

Slauson Farms is a top

outfit; they're having

a great meet.

I got a wife, a new baby boy.

Hey, Charlie, you ever notice

that sometimes you just can't

get ahead for trying?

Hey, Eddie.

Hey, Danny.

Well?

Well, what?

How did it go?

It went.

Did you eat your supper?

Yes.

Did she win?

Did the filly get her win?

Yeah.

No corn dogs?

Uh-uh. Is Baynes happy?

Ecstatic.

Can we go check out

Tom Thumb?

No.

I must be out of my mind,

dragging a little girl around

a race circuit like this.

Eddie!

You should be in a nice

neighborhood in a nice school

and playing with kids your own

age.

Listen, I'm doing--

You're turning into a track

degenerate right before my eyes.

Betting and spying and trying

to buy a horse with no money.

I've got news on that.

Look, we're not gonna take

a look at this horse, okay?

Or any horse, for that matter,

you understand?

You don't have to yell,

you know.

I'm not yelling, but the

thing is we're barely hanging on

here, so no more talk about

Tom Thumb, okay?

You wish I wasn't here,

Eddie, is that it?

Yeah, sometimes.

No, no, that's not what I meant.

Look, hey...

Hey, hey, look here, come here.

You're the best thing in my

whole life.

I wouldn't trade you for

a million dollars.

No kidding?

No kidding.

Two million, maybe.

Oh, no, no, all right,

all right, three million,

not a penny less.

I'm just not sure how good a job

I'm doing sometimes.

You're doing fine.

Yeah, well...

What your papa always used

to say: "If you don't know what

the best thing to do is,

just keep on doing what you know

how to do best."

All we need is a little luck,

that's all.

Mmm.

Luck ain't been much of a

factor around here lately.

That's the thing about luck:

it favors the long shot.

It favors the long shot.

Yeah, maybe it wouldn't hurt

to take just a little peek

at that racehorse.

It wouldn't hurt at all.

It might give us some ideas.

Lots of ideas.

Hey, Eddie, you left

your tack over at Baynes'.

Well, look who just showed up

at the perfect moment.

What?

Gillespie Fields is in Ohio?

Kentucky isn't the only place

they race horses,

just seems that way.

I can't believe we're

doing this.

I don't mind telling you,

anybody catches us in here

we in a pot full of trouble.

Hey, Tom, it's me.

Come on, let's take

a look at you.

His hooves are kind of narrow.

He's a little over

at the knee.

His daddy was just like that.

Keltic Tom was a big horse.

Sixteen-two.

Wish he had a little more

slope to his shoulder.

Barely 16 hands.

But I'd expect his stoutness

makes up for the squareness.

His forelegs look strong

enough, though.

Eddie, I think Danny found

a real horse.

Huh.

Well, he's running tomorrow.

Tomorrow?

What kind of race?

$7,000 claiming race,

first time three-year-olds.

That's pretty cheap.

Does MacVie really think

nobody's gonna claim this horse?

At Gillespie Fields?

The stands are populated with

pet food reps.

Nobody's gonna pay seven bits

for a couple of cans of

dog food.

Then why?

Oh, who knows why these big

barns do anything?

They got all them charts

and fancy guys with calculators

working out things for 'em.


This is crazy.

We don't have $7,000.

Yeah, we have 3,900 saved up.

3,900?

That little girl

knows her horses. [chuckling]

I hit the Pick Six.

Tried to tell you.

Yeah, well, uh...

that still leaves us short.

I only got 1,100.

Feed man took the rest of what

I got from Baynes.

I'm sorry, Danny, I really am

because I'm impressed.

You picked a real good horse

here.

My mom would say, "No sense

waiting for the apple to fall

when it's right there in front

of you, ready for picking."

I've been saving my pennies.

Wait a second, Gerald--

Now I don't have much,

but it's enough to stake you

the difference.

I can't borrow that money

from you.

I wasn't intending on loaning

you money, Eddie.

I want in as a partner.

Unless you got some problem

with that.

I got no problem.

All right! Yes!

Need to see your trainer's

license.

Claim for yourself, Mr., uh...

Fortuna?

Yeah, it's for me.

Uh, for us.

For-- yeah, for me, I guess,

yeah.

[clears throat]

We need a 10% deposit

in cash.

Danny.

One, two, three, four, five,

six, seven.

And here you go.

All right.

Oh, another claim went out

on that horse this morning.

You'll roll the dice

right after the race.

Darn.

I can't roll dice

to save my life.

 Well, it looks like the

 number 8 horse, Tom Thumb,

 seems to be having some

 difficulty joining the other

 horses at the gate.

 There he goes now.

He looks pretty good.

Well, we'll see how he does

on the sloppy track.

 And #8 goes in.

[gate bell rings]

 And away they go!

 Devil's Pride takes the lead.

 #8, Tom Thumb, breaks wide,

 way wide.

 The rest of the pack is

 right behind him...

Jockey's laying into him.

 On the back stretch,

 Devil's Pride leads the pack

 followed by Good Boy Gus.

 Tom Thumb is now dead last.

Just take the ride.

 Followed by Titus

 Andronicus...

 Coming around that far turn

 now, Devil's Pride is still

 in the lead.

 He holds onto the lead to win,

 followed by Titus Andronicus

 and Good Boy Gus, third.

 Tom Thumb trails the pack

 by eight, maybe even

 ten lengths at this point.

We just made a big mistake.

Hey there, Eddie.

Hey, Solly.

What is going on here?


Don't tell me you're the

other claim.

Here I am,

helping you out

every chance I get.

Turns out you're in the

horse-claiming business.

Yeah, but we didn't know

it was...

What is my groom

doing with you all?

He's a friend, and he just

came along for the ride.


There you go.

Gentlemen, shall we?

Four.

I gotta tell you, Solly,

I'm lousy at rolling the dice.

Did you see him out of the

gate there, Eddie?

Oh, no kidding, huh?

Ooh-whee, he was rank,

but old Baynes, he wants him.

Believe me, that's one headache

you're better off without.

Snake eyes.

You did it, Eddie.

Well, Eddie...

hope you know what you're

getting into.

You'll find out soon enough.

Gerald...

we gonna need to talk.

Yeah, I expect we will.

I need the balance

of the money.

[rooster crows]

Harland, perhaps I was

unclear how delicate

our position is this season.

No, ma'am, you have been

perfectly clear.

Then how could something

like this happen?

A mistake.

An accident.

Not an acceptable answer.

I've handled problem horses

like this dozens of times

before, and I had somebody there

to cover the claim.

I'm not interested.

All I know is the son of

Keltic Tom, a horse from one of

our farms, was claimed by a

trainer, his niece,

and a groomer.

Can you imagine what the press

will make of this if-- if this

horse wins just one race?


Unlikely.

I want nothing left

to chance.

What would you like for me

to do?

Fix it.

We need the racing public's

focus on Manifest Wind.

We simply cannot afford

any distractions.

Do we understand each other?

Yes, ma'am.


I just-- I love the fall

weather.

Don't you, Harland?

Ah, yes, ma'am.

Welcome to your new home,

Tom.

Good to have you here.

Now, I don't want you getting

your hopes up here now.

This horse has a lot of work

ahead of him, a lot of

unlearning to do.

I know.

All right, off to school.

Okay, okay.

All right, Tom, come on.

Hiya, Gerald.

Morning, sunshine.

Things didn't go well

with Solly.

Gave me the boot.

I could talk to him.

Oh, it wouldn't do no good.

Enough words said between us to

call it quits.

It's been a long time coming.

I'm sorry, Gerald.

Nobody was holding me

by the foot.

But if it's okay with you,

I'd like to bunk in the tack

room for a while.

Hey, our home is your home,

partner.

Thanks.

Did you see this?

Yeah, I saw it last night.

MacVie wasn't so far off the

mark testing his running legs.

Well, you know, these big

barns ain't got time to work on

something like that.

Time we got.

Come on, Tom, time to go to

school.

â™ªâ™ª

[horse neighing]

Oh, man.

Well?

Not bad.


Not bad, he says.

Come on, what do you think?

What are you looking to start

him in?

Seven furlongs.

There's a small stakes race

next Wednesday.

That's taking a mighty chaw

off a little cigar.

Well, Kent, we don't

expect him to win.

Well, what's in it for me

then?

I don't wanna be passing up

a better horse.

Wait a second, am I missing

something here?

Are you racing under

an assumed name?

You're lucky to get two mounts

a day.

That's all the more reason

to be picky.

Aw, don't get cocky on me

now.

All right, uh... I'll give you

double your fee if he's out of

the money and triple your cut

if he's in.

Double my fee?

And triple your cut.

Well, all right.

You better win.

If I'd known this wishing

stuff worked, I'd have tried it

years ago.

Today's the day you're gonna

show 'em all, aren't you, Tom?

Here we go.

35-to-1 they're giving him.

What kind of an insult is that?


All right, who picked

these out?

Great, huh?

No one will have trouble

finding me in the field.

All right, now, listen.

I want you to touch him on the

shoulder at the stretch to

remind him why he's there,

but don't lay into him.

He hates the whip, all right?

Okay.

All right.

All right.

Let's go get a seat, come on.

 The flag is up...

[bell rings]

 And they're off!

 Tom Thumb breaks well,

 over come the inside position.

Good start.

 Number seven, Diligent

 Purpose runs up to the lead

 as Tom Thumb settles into the

 pack, still in good position.

Come on, Tom!

Come on, Tom.

 As they round the 3/4 pole,

 Tom Thumb in pink colors

 starts to make his move

 up to Diligent Purpose.

 Uncle Verde is just behind.

 And now, Tom Thumb--

You can do it!

Come on, Tom.

Don't use the whip.

 And now, Tom Thumb...

 around the rest of the field

 catches up.

 Number one, Tom Thumb,

 holding back...

No!

He had it!

Boy, a fence post's got more

sense than you do.

What the heck was that

all about?

He was doing it for you.

You didn't have to do anything.

She knows more about racing

than you do.

To heck with all of you.

Mr. Fortuna, do you mind?

Mr. MacVie, please,

sit down.

Don't know what they're doing

to that track out there.

Hard as cement.

I know what you mean.

I got a little filly

picked up a rock this morning.

Ouch.

Mm.

So, how's Tom treating you?


I think you know the story.

Yes, indeed, Mr. Fortuna.

Ah, Eddie.

Eddie.

I've had some experiences

with him, mm.

I gotta say you surprised me

putting in a claim on him.

I guess you had your eye on him.

Actually--

Not many folks drive up

to Gillespie to look

for horses to claim.

Some do.

Mm.

I'm not usually prone to errors

in judgment... but I caught

some grief on that one.

Well, ain't that just

the horse-racing business.

Yeah.

Well, if he gets too much

for you to handle...

a rogue like that can suck you

dry-- run by the barn.

Maybe we can work out something.

Dick! Hold up there a minute.

Nice talking to you, MacVie.

Hey, Eddie.

Kent.

You got a second for me?

I don't know, I'm very

popular this morning.

Listen, Eddie,

about yesterday.

I gave your horse a lousy ride,

and I'm sorry.

Go on.

Tom's a game little guy.

He would've been up there

if I had laid my stick off him.


No kidding.

I know.

I should have listened.

I'd be willing to give it

another try if you're willing.

Well, we're not gonna run him

again till Keeneland.

Then Keeneland it'll be.

In the meantime, you need to do

any schooling with him, I'll be

your bug boy.

What do you say?

He's got it, you know.

I can feel it.

That little horse has got

a heart the size of Kentucky.

Don't you know it.

Thanks.


â™ªâ™ª

This is it, Squirt.

We're headed for the big time--

Keeneland.

You have no idea how many times

your Pop and I dreamed

about this.

I knew he'd be here.

I knew it.

This is just great.

Tom's going to love it here.

It's so beautiful.

Hey, we're chopping in

the tall cotton now,

aren't we, girl?

[overlapping chatter]

Do you know where you are,

Tom?

You're at Keeneland,

land of champions.

And just 'cause you're

different, don't let anybody

tell you you're not a champion.

You're gonna show them all.

When they see you running

your heart out, they'll know.

They'll know.

They'll say, "There goes

Tom Thumb, son of Keltic Tom.

What a champ."

[horse brays]

Oh, I love you too, Tom.

â™ªâ™ª

Don't be loony,

listen to Mooney.

That's what Mooney says.

Only two bucks a pop,

two bucks a crack.

Hey, kid.

Thank you.

 Horses are now being saddled

 in the paddock for the first

 of today's exciting

 ten-race program.

 At this stage, there are

 no late scratchers,

 no late jockey changes,

 and the main track is listed

 as fast.

He look all right?

He look all right to you?

I think so, I think so.

All right, Tom,

let's do it right this time.

[gate bell rings]

 And away they go.

 What a way to come off

 to a good beginning.

 It's Jo Jo Monkey

 the quickest into stride.

 Left Arm is showing

 thunderly speed as well,

 and Tom Thumb is tucked in

 right behind the leader

 down at the rail.

 Into the first turn they go,

 and it's Jo Jo Monkey...


 Tom Thumb is now

 the new leader.

 Jo Jo Monkey is right there

 with Left Arm also right

 in contention.

 As they swing out of this turn,

 it's still Tom Thumb

 who's got the lead to himself.

 Tom Thumb now sets sail

 for home.

 Jo Jo Monkey and Left Arm

 are coming to chase him home,

 but it's Tom Thumb--

There you go!

Come on, Tom!

Come on, Tom!

Here we go!

Come on, Tom!

Come on! Here we go!

[overlapping shouting]

 Tom Thumb has held on--


We did it!

Ha, ha, we did it!

We did it!

Put here there, partner!

Win or place,

that horse ran a good race.

Darn good race, huh?

Come on.

He's a real champion, huh?

I think so, ma'am.

Come on, Eddie.

â™ªâ™ª

 And now, in the winner's

 circle is number four,

 Tom Thumb.

 He's a three-year-old son

 of the great Keltic Tom,

 bred by the Slauson farm,

 and now owned and conditioned

 by Eddie Fortuna.

That's him, you ready?

Hold it right there.

Can we have one more?

Sure.

This is our first.

Okay.

Hold it.

Great, got it.

All right.

Eddie!

Eddie, my boy.

That was wonderful!

Great, little race.

You had Baynes pulling out

his hair.


Did I?

You did good, just like

I knew you would.

I thought you'd be sore

after this?

Sore? Eddie?

We're like family.

I'm here to welcome you

to the club.

You got your jump up in class,

and I'm proud of you.

What's more important-- your

brother'd be proud of you too.

Thanks, Solly.

Thanks.

He did look good, didn't he?

Hey, you're buying dinner.

â™ª Hello, Mooney, hello 

â™ª Hello, Mooney, hello 

â™ª Hello, Mooney 

â™ª Mooney, Mooney 

â™ª Here are my notes 

â™ª Thank you, Mooney 

â™ª Thanks for the money 

Hey, check out the morning

paper, that'll give you

something to sing about.

Gotcha.


"Owned and trained by

Edward S. Fortuna.

Son of the great Keltic Tom,

little Tom Thumb had his first

win yesterday by a nose.

Could another Slauson Farms

progeny be making headlines

this season?"

I know, I'll--

I'll try again.

Eddie, you got a minute?

Oh, a minute I've got,

Harland.

What's up?

If I could come straight

to the point, it's about your

horse.

What horse is that?

Well, Eddie, you only have

one horse, Tom Thumb,

and Mrs. Slauson wants him back.

She's sincere, and she's known

to be quite generous

in sentimental matters.

Sentimental?

Well, she did grow up

with Tom's daddy.

Now, I can't begin to understand

her emotions.

But, the point is, she's willing

to offer a very substantial sum.

Harland, now it's my turn

to be frank.

See, I have very little to say

in the matter.

I'm not sure I understand.

I've only got 10% of the

horse, Gerald's got 20%.

You see, my niece is the

majority owner.

Eddie, I'm trying to be

serious.

Well, me too, especially me.

Look, I'll ask her, but, uh,

you know, she's sentimental too.

â™ªâ™ª

 And it's Tom Thumb coming

 away to win.

 Tom Thumb is gonna win

 another one!

 Tom Thumb wins!

 Eddie Fortuna, again in the

 winner's circle.

â™ªâ™ª

Is that sweet or what?

Huh?

What are you working on there?

Figuring out how Tom would do

in a longer distance.

Distance, like what?

Mile and a quarter.

No way.

Mile, tops.

How come?

'Cause he's just not built

for it, that's how come.

I wouldn't be so sure.

I've been looking at most of the

three-year-olds at the meet,

those that have a chance.

Comparing their quarter times

with Tom's quarter times,

then taking their final quarter

time and comparing them to

Tom's final quarter time--

Hold on there, you're just

number pushing.

Now, if Mooney wants to sell

that kind of junk to the betting

public, fine.

But, it's got nothing to do with

racing horses.

Just listen a second.

Tom takes the back stretch slow,

we know that.

But, in the final stretch,

guess which horse comes closest

to Tom's final quarter time?

I don't know.

Guess.

Don't care.

Manifest Wind.

Yeah.

See, there's lots of early

speed horses--

Early speed wins the race.

Why is Tom winning?

Because he hasn't gone up

against horses with a lot of

speed yet, that's how come.

Mooney says it ain't

how fast--

"Mooney says, Mooney says."

If that guy was so smart,

he'd be living in the south

of France.

But, he's not.

Eat.


Hey, Danny, what you know?

Nice!

Wanna go for a ride in our

new car?

Sure.

It's beautiful.

See ya, Kent.

See ya in the winner's

circle.

Nice looking.

Thank you, sir.

Whose is he?

Excuse me?

Who owns him?

I do.

Nice looking.

â™ªâ™ª

 A familiar face

 in the winner's circle here

 at Stevensons Meet.

 Tom Thumb making a third

 appearance.

 Jockey Kent Rose says his horse

 has the heart the size of

 Kentucky, and we believe him.

 He must be making his trainer

 Eddie Fortuna a very happy man.

And now it's on for the

Tucker Stakes.

[men chuckling]

What?

Well, Danny, there's a big

difference between the races

he's been winning and the

Tucker Stakes.

A win's a win.

Well, not when you're talking

about going nose to nose with

the likes of Manifest Wind or

any of the top-class contenders.

Tom could do it.

He's got the class and the

heart.

And he can run the distance,

you give him a chance.

Well, we'll see.

Well, now, is this here the

Eddie Fortuna private box?

Hey, Solly.

Heya, Solly.

How you doing?

I'm going to look after

Mr. How Do You Do, give the

old man his mineral bath.

Come on, Danny, give me a hand.

Yeah, mm-hmm.

Just thought I'd come by and

congratulate you once again.

Thanks, Solly.

Boy, you keep winning the way

you do, you gonna have owners

coming out of the woodwork.

Well, I can handle that.

You, uh, got some offers in?

Oh, just some talk, you know.

Yeah, I'm sure.

I got a little idea myself.

Yeah, what's that?

Yeah, Baynes is all for it.

"Bring the boy in," he says.

"Give us a little taste of his

magic," he says.

Baynes likes what you're doing

at the meet.

What are you talking about

here?

Wasn't it obvious, Eddie?

I'm asking you to come in

with me.

You're kidding.

I know, I know, I should have

done it years ago,

but I'm doing it now.

Ooh-wee, what we could do with

that little horse of yours,

all Baynes' money behind us.

Well, I'd have to talk it

over with Gerald and Danny.

We're partners.

Eddie...

I'm offering you a solid

opportunity here.

I mean, this is Big Solly

talking to you, we're--

we're like family, I thought--

Well, Solly, wait--

Now, I'm looking for my move

up in class, too.

And I'm gonna have to have a

worthy successor.

Solly, I'm just saying,

give me some time to think

about it.

All right.

Just remember, Eddie,

you're a winning trainer now.

Take advantage of that.

It ain't gonna last forever.

â™ªâ™ª

[horse whinnying]

Hey!

â™ªâ™ª

What did he use?

Penicillin.

Wouldn't have hurt him, but it

would show up in a drug

screening and gotten us

suspended.

Get a good look at this guy?

Oh, yeah, I saw him.

You ever see him before?

No, not from around here.

[music playing]

Hey, Solly, I have to talk

to you a minute.

Sure, Eddie.

Well, fellas, you mind excusing

us for a minute?

I heard about your troubles.

Some sorry state we dropped

into.

Yeah, look, look, I can't

prove it, but I'm pretty sure

it's Harland MacVie.

Pretty sure?

Well, Mrs. Slauson's got him

in hot water by letting that

horse go.

Well, Eddie, if you don't

have any proof, can't do diddly.

And even if you had proof,

against people like that,

pssh, you know the drill.

What are you saying?

I should just, uh, back off?

Take a hint to keep my place,

be a good boy?

Be smart, Eddie.

Look, I got a lousy

nickel and dime public barn

and I know that.

I got one horse, count 'em, one

horse who's finally bringing me

and Danny a little respect.

And if that's not part of their

plan, well, that's too bad.

Don't get your blood in

a boil.

Look, look, I am gonna keep

what little I got.

Now, you can bet on that.

Hey, Eddie.

Hey.

Get cleaned up.

What's cooking?

We're going visiting.

Nobody's gonna mess with us,

not now that we finally got

a chance.

You called her,

just like that?

Just like that, told her

we needed to talk.

She said, "Come right up,"

and bring you, too.

Me?

You.

I suppose she wants to pat you

on the head or give you

a lollipop or something.

Oh, great.

â™ªâ™ª

Wow.

Yeah.

[clears throat]

Well?

Mr. Fortuna.

Ma'am.

I'm so glad you called.

I've been wanting to meet the

gentleman who's having such

splendid success with my little

Tom Thumb.

Harland?

Yes, ma'am?

Take Mr. Fortuna and show him

our barns, and then we'll just

meet later in the rose garden

for some tea.

Danielle.

That's such a lovely name.

Uh--

Eddie.

Come on, you are in

for a real treat.

You know, when I was your

age, you couldn't pry me away

from the barns.

I'd be right out there, wiping

down those horses, feeding those

horses, even playing cards

with the grooms.

Ah, and my mother would just be

horrified.

But, my father would say,

"Now, Martha, you just let

her be, she's a horse woman."

Now, I find that I spend more

time here, in my rose garden.

Strange, how things are as you--

as you get older.

Her great-great-great-

grandfather brought one of the

first Darley colts from Ireland

over here in 1784,

would you believe?

I'm impressed.

We have quite a collection

of 24-karat horse flesh

in this barn, Eddie.

Yeah, uh--

Slauson Farms is probably as

close to heaven as two horsemen

like you and I are liable

to get.

Look, Harland--

We've got doodads and

gadgets in here, most of them

so modern, I don't know what

half of 'em do.

Eddie, the days of liniment and

hot wraps are just about over.

I was impressed to learn that

you actually discovered Tom.

Yes, ma'am.

You even raised the money

to claim him?

I sure did.

You're a precocious young

lady, and I intend to give you

the respect that I would give

any adult.

Manifest Wind is our champion

this season.

We expect for him to be the

winner of the Tucker Stakes.

You're that sure?

Completely.

But, like any good horse player,

I-- I prefer to hedge my bets.

Please.

$50,000.

Eddie, can I come right to

the point?

You always seem to, Harland.

We need a new farm manager--

somebody that can take these

yearlings and school 'em right

before they leave the farm.

I don't wanna take a chance on

another Tom Thumb slipping away,

if you get my meaning.

I think you're the man for

the job.

Salary's fair, you get a chance

to work with the best.

You and your niece would have a

house right here on the grounds.

School bus runs right by

the main gate there.

[horse whinnying]

You're a clever girl.

I don't need to tell you what

that kind of money can buy.

I'll have to think about it.

Well, of course.

That is your decision.

But, in 24 hours, I will put a

stop payment on that check.

Do you know what that means?

That means that in 24 hours

the offer is void

and the matter is closed.

Can I think about it?

Chance of a lifetime, Eddie.

They don't come along often.

Yeah, I've noticed.


Did you give him heck?

You bet I did.

How 'bout you?

Oh, did I.

â™ªâ™ª

He just doesn't wanna go

today.

Yeah, he come up a little

sore on the front end.

Well, we'll work him light.

Maybe he'll be ready for

Saturday.

We'll have him ready.

[horse whinnying]

Hey, Danny, what's going on?

Nothing, just thinking.

Didn't you hear what we said

out there?

Yeah.

You know what Saturday is.

Of course, the Tucker Stakes.

Tucker Stakes, yeah, we

thought you'd be jumping

up and down.

Just, I don't know.

Maybe he's not ready.

Could be he's not.

Oh, he's ready.

We're ready, aren't we, Gerald?

Oh, he's raring to show

his stuff.

Yeah.

Really?

Really.

Really, so, you got that

nominating form?

Yeah, right here in my

notebook.

Danny, what's this?

Nothing.


tell us about this?

I wasn't.

It was made out to me, you know.

Do you understand what a

partnership is?

That's when all of us decide

what's right for us,

not one person.

It's about mutual trust.

So, when were you gonna tell

me about MacVie offering you a

job at Slauson Farms, huh?

How'd you find out about

that?

She told me.

Well, that's different.

How different?

Look, I have no intention of

selling that horse back to

Mrs. Slauson.

Oh, so it's okay for you to

decide why, because you're

older than me?

Well, something like that,

yeah.

If it wasn't for me, you'd

still be dragging Mr. How Do You

Do around the track

every other week--

Now, wait a second--

Hey, you got a lot of nerve.

And if it wasn't for Gerald,

we wouldn't have enough money

to claim him.

Hold on now--

If it weren't for me,

the horse never woulda gotten

out of the gate.

Tom woulda found a way.

Oh yeah, says who?

Stop it, both of you, now!

Come on!

I mean, we're partners, right?

Now, Danny, you should know,

what you got there, that's a lot

of money.

Money we could all use,

but you especially.

I mean, all that talk about

dreams, right there in

that check.

A lot of people got money.

We're the only ones that got

Tom.

So, it seems to me that

there's a vote to be taken

among partners?

Yeah.

Yeah.

All right, then.

We'll give it the old "one for

the money, two for the show,"

okay?

What?

One finger, we keep the

money.

Two fingers, we enter Tom

in the Tucker Stakes and take

our chances.

You ready?

All right, now, on three.

One, two...

Yeah!


I wasn't gonna cash it in

anyway.


[playing "First Call"]

Mooney says, Mooney says,

"Better than a rabbit's foot."

That's what Mooney says.

Mooney says, Mooney says,

"Better than a rabbit's foot."

That's what-- hey, good luck

today, Danny.

Thanks.

You're gonna need it.

 It's a perfect day for the

 120th running of the Tucker

 Stakes.

 The finest thoroughbreds from

 around the country are being

 saddled in the paddock

 by some of the finest trainers.

 Named after that infamous

 horseman,

 Colonel Ronald Fenton Tucker,

 the Tucker Stakes is one of...

All right.

Gonna be a fun one today,

boss.

Yep.

Look, keep him settled around

the turns.

Don't try anything fancy,

all right?

All right.

Good luck today, Danielle.

Same to you, Mrs. Slauson.

 Of chief interest today

 will be the showdown between

 former stablemate Tom Thumb,

 now wearing the pink and blue

 colors of Eddie Fortuna's

 farm, and Manifest Wind,

 in Slauson Farms' famous

 gold and red silk.

Everything's gonna be okay.

It's all right.

Hmm?

â™ªâ™ª

[punching, man grunting]

[overlapping chatter]

â™ªâ™ª

 You can almost feel the

 tension now as they start to

 load in for the big event

 of the afternoon.

 Manifest Wind is one of the

 first ones to take up his place

 towards the inside.

â™ªâ™ª

Come on, they're just getting

to the gate.

â™ªâ™ª

'Kay, partners,

we're all set.

Look.

It's that creepy guy who asked

me about Tom.

Gerald, can you see him?

Is that the guy who was in

our barn?

[gate bell rings]

 And away they go.

 And Tom Thumb is being

 hopelessly left at the gate.

 Tom Thumb, well, has lost about

 seven lengths and is last

 a long way.

 Breaking Barefoot and

 Manifest Wind on the inside,

 and Manifest Wind goes out

 to lead at a fast pace

 with Outrageous Ollie

 showing early speed too, and

 then Our Weekend.

 And a long, long way back

 is Tom Thumb, far behind.

You can't make it all up

at once, come on.

That's it, nice and easy.

 Into the first turn they go,

 and Manifest Wind is getting a

 fast pace on the lead.

 Outrageous Ollie is showing

 some speed as well,

 and we drop back...

Yeah, you can do it, Tom,

come on, now.

 But Tom Thumb is now

 managing to come...

[announcer trailing off]

â™ªâ™ª

Look at that horse run.

â™ªâ™ª

Come on, Tom.

He's making a move now!

He's looking good.

He's making a move!

â™ªâ™ª

That's right, just give him

a tap.

Come on!

Hold him tight.

 ...take the turn for home.

 And Manifest Wind is the horse

 they have to catch.

 It's Manifest Wind,

 he's going for home!

 Tom Thumb has made an

 incredible run!

 And it looks like we're down

 to these two.

Come on, Tom!

 ...and Tom Thumb is flying

 on the outside!

 But Manifest Wind...

Yeah!

Come on!

 What a horse race we have!

 Manifest Wind on the inside.

Manifest!

 Tom Thumb is running

 alongside!

 These two are neck and neck.

 Nose to nose through the lanes!

 Neither one will give an inch!

 Manifest Wind and Tom Thumb's

 gonna run for the wire

 together!

 It's Manifest Wind,

 now it's Tom Thumb!

Come on, Tom!

Come on, Tom!

Come on, boy!

Yes! Yes!

 They run down to the wire,

 Tom Thumb on the outside,

 Manifest Wind on the rail!

 It's so close!

 Maybe Tom Thumb, but Manifest

 Wind is right there!

 We're gonna have to wait for

 the official photo finish

 to determine who's won it!

 Either Tom Thumb or Manifest

 Wind, just a nose separating

 them at the wire.

 It'll be either one of those

 two numbers that'll go into

 the board.

 But, it's so close.

 We should try to call it before

 the official photo finish line

 comes out.

 Number 8, Tom Thumb's number

 is on the board, but still

 a photo, this one could go

 either way.

 It is not official.

 Tom Thumb or Manifest Wind's

 the winner, but please hold on

 to all those tickets.

I told ya we had a chance!

 Taking a look up the track

 now, and oh, my goodness.

 Tom Thumb, possibly something

 wrong with him.

 He's starting to limp back now.

 Tom Thumb, seems to be

 a problem here.

Hey, Doc!

Yeah, Doc, he's bad.

Something's bad wrong.

Doc, is it broken?

No, there are no fractures.

This tendon's severely bowed.

All that straining to win.

Might be best if we just

put him down.

No!

There must be something.

Oh, there's always something,

Eddie.

Eddie, please don't let them

put Tom down.

Do what you have to do.

Eddie, please.

Save him.

Honey.

Please.

Hey, now you can come

with me now--

Eddie, please?

Please?

Come on, let your uncle

take care of this, all right?

I hate him.

Now, who would that be?

Doesn't have to do it.

Dumb old horse did his best,

he did better than best--

I think if you're referring

to your uncle, I think you got

it all wrong.

No, I don't.

Well, then shame on you.

Shame on you for thinking that

your 11 years on this earth

give you the wisdom to...

Oh, Tom.

You think you're the only one

hurting around here?

Don't you have any idea what

this means to Eddie?

To me?

Haven't you got any idea about

anything except yourself?

Hey, look, Danny!

[horse whinnying]

Please, don't let anything

happen to him.

Not to Tom.

He did his best, don't let him

be put down.

Is that too much to ask for?

Ooh-wee, I thought that

little son of a gun gonna take

it away from us.

Gotta admire that little

so-and-so.

Even with you yanking on him, he

pulled right up to the money.

It went all right, but you

coulda done better.

You shoulda stuck to him longer.

Yeah, yeah, coulda,

shoulda, woulda.

You got my money or what?

Yeah, I got your money.

Danny?

Are you all right?

Yeah. Look.

All right, now don't spend

no money in town.

You get out, and get out fast.

That's okay with me.

This place gives me the creeps.

Remember, don't flash this

around.

You know that guy, Solly?

I know that guy.

He just a fella I'm paying

a side bet off to.

Why?

Eddie.

Why would you mess with

my horse?

Why would you mess with Tom?

I asked you a question!

I-- I did it-- I did it

to impress MacVie.

MacVie put you up to this?

It was my idea.

He didn't know nothing about it.

Eddie, I-- I messed up on

claiming the horse.

I-- I had to show him that I--

I still could be a mover.

You and I, we cried over

my brother's grave.

I trusted you, Solly.

I'm thinking, hey, Solly's

watching out for me.

But, you never were.

We all want that move up,

Eddie.

Get out of here.

It's just business, Eddie.

Hey, Solly, how you doing?

I believe these gentlemen in

uniform would like to have

a word with you.

You okay?

Yeah, honey, I'm okay.

Yeah, that railbird is

singing, and I don't think Solly

likes the song.

 The final results of the

 Tucker Stakes are in.

 The judges have declared

 Tom Thumb the official winner.

Well, well.

We won.

 And Keeneland wishes Tom

 Thumb a speedy recovery.

â™ªâ™ª

Hey, Eddie.

Hey, Danny.

Hiya, Tom, how you doing?

Ah, he's getting there.

Be showing them your stuff

in no time.

Well, we'll see.

Maybe.

Hey, Mrs. Slauson called

this morning.

No kidding?

Job's still open if we

want it.

And?

And nothing, I told her

we'd talk it over.

Spending the winter on Slauson

Farm'd be a pretty good deal.

Sure would beat that leaky

old trailer.

Yeah, I guess.

But, we're doing okay,

aren't we?

Yeah, we're doing fine.

Just fine.

Guess luck finally found its

way to the Fortuna barn, hmm?

Luck always favors

a long shot.

Nope, luck always favors

the best horse.

Right, Tom?
