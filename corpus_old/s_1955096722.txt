<i>Blow out your candles,
sweetie.</i>

Can I open presents now,
mommy?

Sweetie,
what do we say?

Please?

All right.

Actually,
Britney and Bella and I

sort of have a special gift
for Sophia, if that's okay?

It's fantastic.

I love surprises.

-Do you wanna go get it?
-Yeah, excuse me.

Sophia, honey, what do you say
to Bella and Britney

for getting you a surprise?

Thank you!

You're welcome.

Mommy!

I'm sorry,
will you take her away?

She's terrified.

It's okay, it's okay, sweetie.
She's gone away.

I am so sorry.

No, it's fine.
She's just sensitive.

What do you think daddy?

Think it's time
for our gift now?

Yeah, that's a good idea.
You hold Winston for a sec?

Yeah.

Sophia, look what
I got for you.

Look at this.

It's so... big.

Open it up.

A puppy!

-Okay!
-He's perfect.

He's so cute!

Is he all mine, daddy?

Yeah, he sure is.

Your mommy and I thought
that we should get Winston

a companion for his last
few years with us,

<i>you know,
make him feel young again.</i>

Well, I better not be the one
cleaning up after him.

<i>I'll help you.</i>

You said that the last time.

Can Winston
meet the new puppy?

Yeah, sure.

Hold on,
let me get my camera.

<i>Okay, honey, be careful.
-Hi, Winston!</i>

What have I got for you?

You got a friend.

Aw.

See?
He likes him, daddy.

Aw.

Do it again!

<i>I got blood in my hair!</i>

<i>I got blood in my eyes!</i>

<i>-Do we have any...
-Woman: Flashlights?</i>

<i>I come prepared.</i>

Yeah.

There's plenty of space
up here for storage.

Moving boxes,
your hideous couch...

I know,
we'll make it your bedroom.

Ha-ha.

Looky here.

It's locked.

20 bucks says
it's full of old porn.

Let me see.

MacGyver taught me this.

Right.

-Creepy.
-Cool.

<i>Hello?</i>

Brian?

<i>Hey where you guys do
wanna put these chairs?</i>

Why did we
ask him to help?

We didn't.
He volunteered.

Dude,
turn on the lights!

God.

New house.

New roommate.

New adventures.

Cheers.

Thanks, Brian, for lifting
all the heavy stuff.

Of course.

Well,
back to unpacking.

Yay.

So...

What's the plan?

Well, my closet's smaller now.

Only problem with this house.

So I'm gonna pick out
some shoes to give away.

I'm only gonna cry a little.

No, I mean what's
the plan for tonight?

Are we doing anything?

Celebrating or anything?

No, I think we're
just gonna unpack, get settled.

Cool.

What the...

Raccoon.

You know, you should probably
get somebody on the...

First night's adventure!
Hey, Kristen!

Um, actually...

I was gonna say you should call
an exterminator, but I mean...

Kristen?

Well,
she'll miss all the fun.

I can go up first.

I ain't afraid
of no raccoons.

Yeah, 'cause rabies
is all the rage nowadays.

God, Kristen.

You scared me.

Dude, the lights!

God.

Guys?

Is this a joke?

Kristen?

Bertrand,
my good fellow.

Can I invite you round
for some tea?

Perhaps a scone?

No, I'm sorry,
old chap,

but I dined
not an hour hence.

I ate at that the new
cultist delicatessen

over on innsmouth terrace.

I've seen the place.

How fares the cuisine?

Fine, fine.

But the eggs
were a strange lot...

The size of my fist,
leathery,

and constantly shifting in
iridescent color.

Well, that's like no egg
I've ever seen,

and I'm an egg-ologist.

They've left my stomach
in somewhat of a tizzy.

I don't feel too well at all.

No!

-No!
-Yes!

-No!
-Yes!

-No!
-Yes!

Hello?!

Help!

Please!

-Time?
-15 minutes 22 seconds.

Ladies and gentlemen,

the young Philly daystar
with a run of 15:22

has taken the lead in her heat.

In second place overall.

<i>-15:22 did you say?
-Yes.</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
15 minutes 22 seconds</i>

is only 36 seconds
under the absolute best run

for a first-time competitor
in this event.

Ladies and gentlemen,
if you look to the competitor

<i>in the right it looks
like spectacular bid</i>

<i>is making his move.</i>

<i>Let's hope he makes it
under the gun.</i>

Wonderful job, my darling.

You did an excellent run
for a first timer

and especially
for your weight class.

You completed my...
Completely

and gave me a pretty bunny,
I don't mind telling you.

Go on, there you go.

There you go.

I just can't wait to see
what you do in round two.

<i>I don't have all day.</i>

<i>I've got a lot
of other deliveries to get to,</i>

<i>and you're holding me up.</i>

<i>Can you please just sign this
so I can leave?</i>

Here's a pen,
here's the page.

Just sign it at the "x."

Hey, sorry, long day.

Can either of you sign this?
Anyone?

What's this?

Mom's stuff.
There's so much.

-Your mom's stuff?
-You kidding me?

Please just sign this.
Are you even listening to me?

Are you gonna leave
all the stuff here?

It's a delivery.
I delivered it. Here it is.

Okay, I got it.

Let us help you.

Come on.
Let's get this sorted.

<i>Holger.</i>

Are you okay?

Did you just say my name?

What?

It sounded like you just said
my name right next to me.

Sorry.

It's okay.
Thank you.

Okay.
Let's keep moving.

Weird.

<i>-It sounded like you were
right next to me. Laura.</i>

Christy?

Did you just say my name?

<i>Laura, Laura come here.</i>

<i>Laura, it's okay.</i>

Okay, it's nothing.

How rude.

After everything today,

the ghost doesn't
even say my name.

That's what I
was about to say.

It wasn't just
that it said my name, it...

-It sounded just like you.
-Exactly like you.

-And you wanted me to.
-I didn't say anything.

The building lights
must be messed up again.

I'm gonna go.

<i>Let's play.</i>

Hey guys, where's Ella?

<i>We should look for her.</i>

Is he serious?

This is insane.

Look, we've already established
this whole thing is insane.

Quick, we only have four
and a half minutes to decide.

Now, wait, the quicker
we gang up on each other,

the quicker
they can kill us...

If we don't choose,
any one of us could die.

Do you wanna be responsible
for someone else's death?

Amber's right.
We can't choose.

Jesus, Ella,
where did you get that?

I nominate Ivy
to be the one who dies.

Me?

I know who
you are now.

I'm not following, El.

They never released
the name to my family

because the driver
was a minor.

She pled guilty.
Did her time, supposedly.

Ivy was the drunk driver
who killed my sister.

Is that true?

It was a
really dark time, okay?

I'm not the same person
I was back then.

You still drink.

You still have fun.
And guess what?

My sister doesn't get to!

El!

You think I don't live
with that every day?

I do!
I've changed.

<i>They tried to drive
us all crazy, one by one.</i>

<i>Some of the girls
think we're a team.</i>

<i>Deep down, we know the truth.
We're all alone.</i>

Wait,
it's not what you think.

<i>Truth is...</i>

<i>I don't give a fuck
about any of them.</i>

<i>If being here
has taught me anything</i>

<i>it's to look out
for number one.</i>

<i>Screw everyone else.</i>

-Is that from the confession room?
-No, no!

I don't even know
how they have that.

You heard it yourself,
girls.

She'd stab anyone of us
in the back if she had the...

Let's just turn it down and
let's just talk about it, okay?

That recording was made
a long time ago.

Please, you guys
have to believe me.

Let's take a vote.
Majority rules.

-I vote we choose Ivy.
-Come on, Ella.

Is that really what
your sister would want?

Don't fucking talk
about my sister!

Stop it, you guys!

This is exactly
what they want us to do.

-We have to vote, Amber.
-No, we don't.

I wholeheartedly agree.

-Lila?
-I vote...

I choose Ivy.

<i>Always look out
for number one, right?</i>

Just think
what you are doing.

That's two for and two against.

You're the tiebreaker, Shelly.
What's your vote?

<i>Shelly!</i>

She said herself
she'd take us all out.

<i>If it has to be one of us...</i>

I choose Ivy.

Get her on the ground.

Ella? Ella. Please.
Please don't do this.

Ella.

Please don't do this.

You took my sister
away from me.

I'm so sorry.

This won't bring her back.

I loved her so much.

<i>Ella, look at me.</i>

How dare you.

Look at me.

You don't want this.

<i>Ivy, no!</i>

Do it.

-I'll do it. I'll do it.
-Do it, you wussy.

-Freaking shut up. Shut up.
-So, it, piece of crap.

-Shut up. Shut up. Shut up, shut up.
-Do it. Do it.

You trust me?

-Do it, you wuss.
-You want me to?

-Yeah. Yeah, come on do it.
-Yeah?

-I'm gonna put this right in your brain.
-Great, do it.

Trust?

Uncle.

Seriously?

Yeah, you're aiming it
right at me.

This isn't even the closest
I've come all day.

I know, you win.

What, you didn't trust me?

<i>Hey, it's Brad.</i>

<i>I'm planning to come by
and get my stuff.</i>

<i>You and I both know
this is for the best.</i>

<i>Please don't be around
when I come by.</i>

<i>Hey, it's Brad.</i>

<i>I'm planning to come by
and get my stuff.</i>

<i>You and I both know
this is for the best...</i>

<i>Hey, it's Brad.</i>

<i>I'm planning to come by
and get my stuff.</i>

<i>You and I both know
this is for the best...</i>

<i>Hey, it's Brad</i>

I can't keep it.

Here's your stuff.

This was yours, too,
isn't it?

I'll put you away later.

What the hell?

Go on,
get out of here, go!

Go! Shoo!

Apple?

Yes, yes,
I'll be right upstairs.

<i>No, no, the last one I was
telling you about.</i>

Yeah, for sure.
Give me a call back later.

<i>Tomato.</i>

Cow.

You fucking kid!

Hey! What are you doing
out here?!

Fish.

People.

Fish.

What the hell are you
doing in my house?!

People. Fish.

Could you just
not do that?

That better be your parents.

Hi, hi, hi, hi!
My name is grace.

I'm your neighbor.
I have an eight-year old son.

<i>And Mr. Schultz said
that he saw him here with you?</i>

<i>Yes, yes,
he's right upstairs...</i>

People.

<i>He knows not to go up there!</i>

I've told him a thousand times
not to go up there!

So the next thing you know,
he's screaming bloody murder.

I run to his room,
and he is completely gone.

No.

You can't possibly imagine.

But he's safe.
Thank god.

Bread. Fish.

Okay, I have to ask.

What is he doing,
and why is he doing that?

Is it like tourette's?

No, it's nothing like that.

<i>-Okay, good.
-It's his psychic ability.</i>

Um, what?

Although it's not
what one might expect.

Trevor's psychic ability

is merely to know
the last things somebody ate.

-Bread.
-Very good.

Fish.

My god, he's right.
I had Sushi for lunch,

-yes.
-It's an interesting ability.

There's a really cute little
diner called shallow fork,

they have really great pastries.
And it's really good coffee.

I owe you a meal at the
least. It's the least I can do.

Not at all.

Thank you again
for everything.

Bread. Fish. People.

Come on.

No, she is not as crazy
as he is.

But get this...

Apparently he has
a psychic ability.

No, I'm serious.

God, no, no,
it's nothing cool.

His psychic ability
is to know

the last thing
that somebody ate.

It's the lamest thing ever.

No, no buddy.

Tonight's dinner
is for me and a guest.

Norman. Norman.

Hi, hi.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

That's okay.

This is Norman.

Hi, Norman.

He's a really,
really sweet boy.

I'm sure he is.

Hi.
Come this way.

Okay.

A little surprise.

Here you go.

How cute.

Yeah, thank you.

I'm gonna go get our food.

Okay.

Norman, stay.
Good boy, good boy.

I did. I did.

-You're a really good cook.
-Thank you.

This is like...
It's impressive.

Well, you're the first
girl I've had over

to try my meat balls.

Did you actually
just say that?

I did, I did.

So I have to work
tomorrow morning.

Okay.

I brought
an overnight bag, though.

Cool.

Sorry. Norman, Norman.

Norman, Norman,
come here, boy, come here.

Stay, stay, stay.

<i>Don't go.</i>

-I have to go at work.
-Okay.

<i>Eva, you still here?</i>

<i>Eva, you still here?</i>

<i>This is Eva.</i>

<i>-If I know you,
leave me a message.</i>

<i>Hey, Eva, it's Jonah.</i>

<i>I just wanted to say I had
a great time the other night...</i>

<i>Again.</i>

I... I hope to hear
from you again soon.

Bye.

I know.
I know, boy, I know.

<i>I'm not good enough
for another one.</i>

<i>Gimme a kiss.
Gimme a kiss.</i>

No, wait, no! No!

<i>No.</i>

<i>Please! Please, no!</i>

<i>Help me! Help me!</i>

<i>Please!
Please, help me!</i>

This shit
is so predictable.

<i>Yeah.
Killer in a goofy mask</i>

<i>stalks helpless teens,
kills them and gets killed.</i>

Or does he?

It's not about the plot.
It's about the execution.

<i>Or executions,
am I right?</i>

Classic.

<i>You can take all of my clothes</i>

<i>and leave me nothing
but a towel to dry with.</i>

<i>I couldn't run away
without clothes.</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>Well, then you could
watch me while I take the bath</i>

<i>to make sure I don't
try anything.</i>

<i>God damn it!</i>

All right, I'm gonna
go drain the python.

I always thought of you
as having

more of the garden variety.

You know you're too good
for him, right?

Hey, hey, hey.

More importantly is he knows.

I think he'd do, like,
anything for me.

He'd give me his left arm
if I asked him to.

-What the hell?
-Paul?

Run!

I'll take my own advice.

God!

Nancy.

Nancy. Nancy.

P-please.

Please.

I'm coming for you, Paul.

My god, please!

You killed my fucking friends,
you asshole!

You stay dead.

Let me go.

Brace yourself.
This can be cold.

You weren't kidding.

I have to say you look
a little bit further along

in this stage of your pregnancy
than you should be.

Could something be wrong?

No, I don't think so.
But we're gonna take a look.

Is it just you today?

Yes, Jeremy, he doesn't
wanna know the sex.

-Well, you know, he could come and...
-it's fine.

Looks like
we're getting some...

What is it?

Doctor, what is it?

<i>Hey, honey, how you doing?</i>

Can you get
me some water?

Yeah, sure.

<i>Howard, I'm gonna show you
these photographs.</i>

<i>I need you to tell me
what you know about them.</i>

<i>Do you recognize
that little boy?</i>

That's me.
Small me.

<i>And the next one.</i>

<i>Where's Francis?
Francis dormyer is missing.</i>

<i>Now when you escaped
from the house...</i>

I wasn't escaping.

<i>What were you doing?</i>

Groceries.

Francis forgot
to feed me again.

He's so busy saving people.
I wasn't escaping.

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>One of the neighbor said
she found you banging</i>

<i>on the barricaded front door,
screaming, "help me.</i>

<i>Help me, I'm trapped.
I'm not a little girl"</i>

yeah, that's one
of Francis' favorite games.

He dresses me like a little girl
and makes me drink his tea.

I hate it.

But he says that the angel
says that I need salvation.

<i>I was right.</i>

<i>Howard, you're safe now.</i>

I was safe before.
Francis takes care of me.

He wants to save me.

You, you and all your people,
you look at him,

what he did,
and you think he's evil.

But he's not.

I once felt like you
that murder is wrong.

I've learned so much.

You... you know what?

You only see things
in one dimension.

Wrong, right, good, evil,
savior, sinner.

I'm sick of it!
What is wrong?

What is evil...

Why is it up to us
to judge good and evil?

We're all of evil origins.

But there is salvation!

If you wanted to understand,
you would, but you won't.

But he knows.
He knows who's righteous.

And he'll come for them
and he will save...

It's my time!

It's finally my turn.

<i>Turn it off.</i>

<i>Are you happy?</i>

-Yes.
-Good.

Rose, there's something
I have to ask.

Really?
What's that?

Rose...

Will you make me...

Make me
the happiest man alive

accept this proposal
and be my wife?

Sorry, I should have
let you do that.

-Maybe you've had enough champagne.
-No...

I'm sorry.
So sorry.

That's okay.

Here.

-Do you love me?
-Yes.

-Say it.
-I love you.

Doctor?

<i>Hello?</i>

Hello?

Doctor?

<i>Rose.</i>

Rose!

Well?
What do you say?

What?

James finds himself
in a room

submerged in
three feet of water.

The water is rising.

Three items are
about to be destroyed...

His pistol,
a picture of his family,

and a deck of cards.

-Which one does he choose?
-His pistol.

Darling.

You don't know
how happy you've made me.

Me, too.

I'm sorry.
I don't feel good.

I just...
I think I need... just...

I can't wait to tell
my parents and your parents.

We should call them.
Who should we call first?

Um, I'm... mine.

How are you feeling?

Very strange.

I can't... did i...
Did i...

Focus!

This is so exciting!

Mom?

Yeah.
I really miss you.

Please tell dad I'm sorry.

I will love you always.

-Ouch.
-Come here.

I love you.

Ever since I saw you
in that little blue dress.

That's the one.

Pay attention.

One, two, three,
one, two, three.

-Do it.
-No.

-One, two, three.
-Please stop.

The father enters his house.
The children are playing a game.

-No!
-What game are they playing?

-Stop!
-Wrong.

Three tools hang
in a doorway.

-A hammer, a saw...
-Stop!

Hi, Mary?

Thinner!

Yes, I'll hold.

Sour!

Bitter!

Filler!

Boner.

The Millers!

You wouldn't.

Liver!

Jiggler!

Hitler!

Uninformed voter!

The thing you have to understand
is that China attacked us first.

Thriller!

What in the name
of Dumbledore...

Mother!

God!

Swiffer!

Grindr!

Hey.

Potter!

Gipper!

Wicker... man.

Okay, fine.

I shouldn't have eaten
your macaroni salad.

I'm sorry.

And I shouldn't have
overreacted.

Here, let me
make it up to you.

Centaur!

Hello, ladies.

Thinner.

Three, two, one.

You should tuck her
back in this time.

I really don't think
she wants me to.

You haven't tried.

She's been acting
super weird

since we get back
from the honeymoon.

Don't call her weird.

I didn't call her...

Sorry.

Hey.
What's up, pumpkin?

The monster's in my closet.

Sweetie, you're okay,
it's just a bad dream.

Galen will check it out
for you, okay?

I don't want galen.

I want you.

Well, we'll go together.

We're gonna check out your
room and you're gonna see

it's free of
the boogeyman, okay?

But he's not
the boogeyman.

<i>He told me his name
was Mr. Hendrix.</i>

What did you say?

He's not the boogeyman,
he's...

It's Mr. Hendrix!

Come here, galen.

See?

See?

But he only comes out
in the dark.

Then we can leave
the lights on.

He told me he wants
my soul.

Did you fill his head
with this crap?

Galen, you have school,
and I have work.

-But...
-No buts!

You leave this room again,
I'm gonna SWAT your bottom.

You could have the lights on,
but you've got to stay in bed.

You understand?

<i>Baby's afraid of the dark?</i>

You okay?

I thought maybe I...

Would stay up
with Jordan for a bit.

Are you okay with that?

Yeah?

All right,
I'll leave you two to it.

He comes out of the closet,
doesn't he?

You believe me?

Nobody believed
me either.

Who did you tell?

My dad.

My mom died before I was
really old enough to remember.

I don't remember my dad.

Yeah, well, mine didn't exactly
stick around long enough

to leave me any memories.

Did Mr. Hendrix
say anything to you?

He told me he was gonna
take my soul.

He told me that.

I am not gonna
let him hurt you.

Do you understand me?
Besides I think you're okay.

It's not really you he wants.
I think it's me.

I know.
He told me that, too.

<i>Bye, galen.</i>

Hello?

Hello?

I see you met Hank.

That's what I call him.
A little less creepy that way.

Yeah.

I'm so sorry about that.

We were in the studio
we couldn't hear a thing.

I'm Karen.
I'm Oscar's camera assistant.

Allie, it's literally okay.
I just got here.

Plus I had Hank
to keep me company.

Yeah, well...

He's collected a lot of
weird stuff over the years.

Let me get your bag.
The studio's out back.

Okay. Thanks.

<i>Allie, this is Henry.
Don't mind Henry.</i>

I'm Henry.
Don't mind me.

<i>-Allie.
-Mr. conley.</i>

Can I just say what...
It is such an honor

-to be working with you...
-No, the honor is mine.

It was those eyes, you have
a wonderful naturalism.

I was thinking you
and I can do some really,

really cool together
for this campaign.

How's that sound?

That sounds amazing.

That sounds amazing.

Yes, it does.

Well, why don't you head over
to hair and makeup,

and I will see you soon?

Okay.

Karen?

<i>Right this way.</i>

As I said...

The honor's mine.

Shall we?

I'm a little nervous.

You know, the native people
used to believe

the camera steals the soul,
but I think the only thing you

have to worry about is keeping
those spaghetti straps on.

Um, do you want me
to just...

No, no, no,
I don't want anything from you.

I mean, rather...
I do but...

It's nothing you should have
on your mind.

Just...

Just be you.

I can do that.

<i>That's nice.</i>

<i>I think we got it.</i>

<i>Really?
Are you happy?</i>

Are you?

My soul
feels enriched.

Good, good.

Well, if you want
to get cleaned up,

Karen can
help you with that.

Just, just come back and
say goodbye before you go.

Thank you.
Thank you so much.

I'll see you in a few.

Allie, um... do...

Do you mind if i...

Do you mind if I snap
one more picture...

<i>For my private collection?</i>

Of course.

Um, same spot?
Do you want me to do anything?

No, don't...

Don't change anything,
yeah, yeah.

Same spot's good.

Wow.

That's an incredible
looking camera.

I've never seen one like it.
Where did you find that?

A,
Friend gave it to me.

<i>It takes a very special
kind of picture.</i>

They don't make them
like this anymore.

Now just...

Be you.
