There is pleasure in the forests without path
There is enchantment in the solitary bank

There is society, where nobody interferes
There is music in the bellow of the sea

Not it is that he/she doesn't love the man, but to
the Nature the master more. Lord Byron.

That it happens?
It was in the river... 

I didn't imagine it, him
I listened, I listened Chris... 

You imagined it sky.
No, I didn't imagine it, I listened to it... 

Wayne, Greetings from Fairbanks!

I arrived here two days ago.

It is very difficult that give you a
aventón in the area of Yukon,

But finally I arrived here.

I bought a new book Preposition
of the flora and fauna locals.

I have prepared and stored all the necessary one for
to live outside of the civilization for some months.

Perhaps pass a long time
before he/she returns to the South.

I only want you to know
that you are a great man.

Closed by the winter.

It seems that we have arrived!
Well, thank you.

That sure it would damage my back.
Yes indeed.

Thank you again.

Hey, waits a moment.

He/she takes this, they will maintain your dry feet, any
problem calls me, the number is inside the boots.

Thank you.

Now I began to walk... 

 ... TOWARD THE WILD THING.

Hello... 

Is somebody here?

That he/she comes from front!

Two years to be here.

Without telephone, neither cars,
neither remain silent, neither cigarettes... 

But that doesn't scare me.

It is another form of life,
the challenge is to be grown.

Old man listen, I won't take that turn.
Be quiet that doesn't let me see for where I go.

Where go?
I already told it to him we don't go anywhere!

And now after two years here,
finally the great adventure arrives.

The romantic battle of killing the reinforcement to be
interior, and to find the revolutionary spirit.

Not more being poisoned for
the thought of escaping.

And while in route to the long thing of
this earth, I get lost in the wild thing.

Alexander Supertramp. May of 1992.

University of Emory, Atlanta Georgia.
Two years before the "Magic" bus... 

We are here for those that honor to
the nation with the merit of the study.

All will be stepping earth more
firm, with the power the knowledge.

Nina Glen Lockwin.

Vanessa Denise Lowrie.

Christopher Jhonson McAndles.

Regina Victoria McNabb.

I can see them to the doors
of their University.

I see my father greeting under the stone arch,
the red potteries as blood are behind their head.

I do my mother with some books in
their hands, in the patio of recesses,

the doors of grills are still open
behind her. They are black as their hair.

They are about to graduate.

They are about to marry.

They are only some boys, they are silly.

All that you/they know is of its
innocence, they will never harm to anybody

I want to run to them
and to tell them: "Give birth to!"

Don't make it.

She is the mistaken woman.

He is the mistaken man.

Van to make things that
they have never imagined.

They will make bad things to their children.

Van to suffer eats they never have
listened before. Van to want to die.

I want to go until them and to tell them
all this, but I don't make it.

I want to live.

The volume like to paper puppets and them together
for the hips, and while I make it, I say:

"Make what you/they have to make"

"And I will say of it. "

Are OK already here?

That foolishness!

Good, it could not be more
that what certain was?

Because he/she has to come managing?

There are big poems in this book.

I have to talk him/her about this.

Forgive. He/she is my son he/she has just graduated.

Hey, hello. We were waiting
and waiting. You had me afraid.

Hello dad.
Congratulations son, this it is a great step.

Thank you dad.

It is not supposed that you manage in Georgia.
Because? I have my permission.

It is illegal that minors manage
in a state that is not his.

He/she didn't know it, I obtained that permission legally,
it should not have any problem.

Do they work here?
No.

It seems that all the one
world is of party today.

That they stay there correct?
If Sr.

It would be grandiose if he/she could
to make a graduate degree of laws.

Chris that is wonderful.

It is a great desición.

Will all cost the entrance?

Exactly 24500.68 dollars.
Good, it is affordable.

Your mother and I would be charmed of contributing with you for it.
It is this way.

I will leave when it finishes here,
I have a lot to pack and to organize.

Your father and I want
to make you a present.

We want that you
undo of that pot.

That pot?
That of there.

We will buy you a new car.

A new car?

Because he/she would want a car
new? That is very well.

I mean to my I love this.

Did they hope he/she gave jumps of happiness?

We only thought that we should give you a beautiful one
car, surer, that thing could explode.

To explode! To explode? They are crazy, it is a great one
car. Not I need a new car. And I don't want it.

Not I want any thing, of
these things and things and things... 

Everything has to be to the difficult thing!
Thank you.

He/she only says that he/she wants their old car, it is not the great thing.
Thank you, alone I said what felt.

Chris was manufactured himself a recubrimiento of
coldness that surrounded it. Good-bye Chris!

He/she was always amid a road
solitary, but it found company in their books.

Of authors like Tolstoy,
Jack London and others.

He/she found in them words
applicable to any occasion.

To Pay Oxfam America.

I forgot to ask him/her that it mentions he/she had chosen
to say in their discruso of graduate.

He/she had a good idea of
which will be their target.

It was a fact that Chris will escape.

And when he/she made it, he/she went him/her
to put their distinctive stamp.

Chapter 1: My own birth.

He/she should not refuse that to be
we are always glad escaping.

When our intention
he/she associates with the escape.

I achieved with the loan
to stuff some forms.

That focused me in my objective.

The road is always the first step.

FLOOD.

Lake Urinates, Arizona Julio 1990.

Wild eatable fruits.

I need a name.

Alexander Supertramp. Julio 1990.

For the end of June the crises
world they were increased. Almost all them.

The Apartheid in the South African society.

The civil confrontations and
the crisis of food in Africa.

Clever boy my brother!

For Julio's end not
we had had news of him.

My parents would become annoying.

Chris was never here, so,
he/she decided to leave to the planet of the surprises.

When they arrived to the apartment the landlord
he/she said that Chris had left at the end of May.

And when they arrived home I found them with
the letters that you/they had sent that summer.

And they had been returned
to the addressee.

Chris had made an arrangement in the mail
so that they retained them up to August 1ro,

and this way to win some time.

Do you know something about this?
He/she didn't tell me anything.

He/she understood what was making.

It lost 4 years with the absurdity and
tedious study in the academy.

And now it was wanted to be left that low world the
it influences the parents and the excess of things materials.

The things that separated Chris
of their true existence.

On the way to the crest of the I pacify,
North of California. August of 1990.

Hey boy, an aventón? Mount you.

I sit down to laugh for that
crazy hat that you take.

Up!

This is Rady, I am Jane.
Hello, I am Alex.

Looking for adventure hey?
If.

So you are a radical.

Am I it?

They are called this way to those
that they decide to go on foot.

For that reason we have this vehicle... 
We go, please.

Good, Alex also had his vehicle,
but he/she decided to burn all their money.

Because you made that?

Not I need money.

He/she makes people to be cautious.

We go Alex, it is always necessary to be cautious,
the books won't be good you for everything.

Not you will be able to stay with the help of bay.

Not I know if I want to depend of more than that.

Where your parents are?

Living their lives in some part.

Your parents love you, you exactly.

That it is exactly?

You taste like what I refer.

They feel love... 

 ... for the money, the
fame, the good things... 

That is the true.

Since Chris and I have reason use,
there were always episodes of fury at home.

Violence that we were
forced to witness.

He/she played us very inside.

But, it was also as theater. In the one
I distribute judges and accused they figured.

Dad was a young genius, he made for crucial NASA
designs in the American radar systems.

That was our answer
for Russian SPUTNIK.

Mom became consultant of campaigns her capacity
inventive he/she transformed into wealth and knowledge.

But for the moment in that "the
company" reached the first million,

the money seemed only
to increase their blindness.

I remember the first family meeting, where
they counted us of their divorce plans.

They wanted us to decide
with which wanted to live.

And little time later... 

 ... the divorce happened.

The fights and those
meetings never finished.

He/she took some time for
that Chris and I said:

"It is necessary to continue ahead,
it is necessary to overcome"

God, is firewood to prepare
I eat lunch and food once and for all.

Where Jane left?

My friend, everything is not well
in the life of the hippies.

Do you know that you are a little jodedor?
Probably.

It is amusing as they pass those
sew in certain moments.

I have loved that woman for a lot of time.

She has always been very reserved.

We have been together...  in silence... 

And when we picked up you yesterday, it was no longer
so silent, he/she wanted to speak of it.

Do you know to that refer?

I believe that if.
That it is what you believe.

Good, some people feel
that they don't deserve to be loved.

They walk quiet to
inclination of empty spaces.

To close the breaches with the past.

As much as feeling! God!

Don't you like God or if?

He/she looks who speaks.
You would not like to walk above the water and all that... 

No, I have always feared to the water.

Something that I will overcome in some moment.

So I will swim and your
you take this to the camp.

Sure, he/she walks and you go.
It is well.

The seas only give a blow to the heart.

And you have an opportunity
of feeling strong.

Now, not you a lot about the sea, but
you that that it is the shape in that it is here.

And also you that it is not in the life so
necessary to be strong, but feeling strong.

To prove you at least once to yourself,
to be at least once yourself,

in the oldest thing of
the human condition.

Facing the fact of being alone, without anything
that he/she helps you, more than your hands and your head.

Here I will reach you.

Not I believe that you can.

 ... and maybe to give way to a basement, without more
possession that the enormous foundations of blocks.

Oh that say!
You would like it, you would like if is still amid the road.

 ...  bothering the travelers.
It sounds me well.

If you come we will make you a space.

I swear him to you.

I liked that boy.
I know it.

Chapter 2: Adolescence.

You are very good. You are better than
any apple that has eaten up before.

I Am Superman Supertramp,
and your you are Supermanzana.

You are flavorful san. You are so organic.

So natural.

You are the apple of my life.

At the beginning of September, they received a call
of the police, when the patrol car of highways

he/she found Chris' abandoned car.

A group of searchers
he/she rushed to the desert.

Not there were indications that Chris has returned
to the car, but neither there were indications of struggle.

The police determined that
Chris had left to will.

That didn't make happy my parents that quickly
they realized that what wanted

Chris was really not to be opposing.

Magic Bus
Week 3

21-alert of rice.

Strong, you won't make anything, not
you will go anywhere. The money... 

The power is an illusion. All this here
up. We can be here. Your and me.

1, 2 ...  no, no, no.

2 ... 

3 ... 

Dakota of the South to the This September
10, 1990. 19 months before... 

It is this way like one makes,
you go right, right... 

Wow this is íncreíble.

It feels super.
Mantén the view to the front, won't leave, it grabs the helm well.

That God blesses you, you
I will see in a while my friend.

Hey makes it very well.

I made it to you again.
Don't whore me more Wayne.

I don't know it for my that you/they were of the same side.
I am tired of the same shit.

They agreed,
they agreed.

We go he/she leaves the man,
and leave me that the lame thing.

You go seriously with this.
We go boys we continue with the game.

The good thing of this is to bet everything and that all go to hence.
Do you want to play?

No.

Do you need 20000 pounds?
Those 20 thousand pounds need them clever.

That you think of all this?

I like all this.

Is there some place where he/she can acquire hunt books?
Any thing that you want knows about hunt and preservation of species

you should speak to it with
Kevin, that he/she is the man.

Which is your fascination
for the bleakness?

I leave to Alaska.
Alaska?

There is a city in Alaska, I have buyers
there, and in that city there are markets.

No, I refer to Alaska, the really.

The whole route toward
up, all that me only.

Without clock, neither you count, neither anything, alone to be there, there out,
the mountains, the river, the sky, to be there, in the wild thing.

In the wild thing... 
If, in the wild thing.

That you will make when you are there? I would not know.
Alone you live, you are in that place, you make it a special moment.

If.
Perhaps to the return he/she can write a book of my trips.

About being outside of
this sick society... 

The society.
The society!

Not I can understand, as each person
it can be so bad with the other one... 

Not he/she has felt so much to judge,
to control, all those things... 

That people are speaking?
You already know... 

Parents, hypocrites,
political, cretin... 

That is an error.

It is an error to go so
deep with those things.

You are a very young boy,
an impish young boy.

But I can tell you, you are a youth,
that you have fire in the blood.

And it is kind of a relief... 

Wayne, that they are speaking?
That?

We are speaking of blood and fire,
of as uniting the fire to the blood.

Not I believe that you can
to give advice to anybody.

Do you believe that I am not able to?
If.

I like in knowing it my name it is Sr. Happy.
Sr. Happy.

And Sr. Happy of time
in when he/she gives advice.

Alex, please.
I sit down it.

Sometimes Sr. Happy...  Because
it is always happy Sr. Happy?

Do you know because this happy one?
It is not always happy.

Because it is happy?
Can you tell me that? We go you tell it to me.

I will tell you for that... 

Sit down before you injure.

A thing in which you should notice is always in
what passed in those episodes of Rosswell.

When they made the revision of taxes it was known that
Chris' funds had donated them to the charity.

My parents decided that it could not delay more.
They hired a private investigator, and they notified

to the forces of the nation,
so that they stopped the search.

I imagine to the beautiful gypsies
far from the eyes of the justice.

Good I will give you the
basic that should know.

Since you want to become
in a rebellious youth.

Well, then when you have your prey, the time
it is everything, you have to make sure of conserving

all that is meat. Alone you will have one hour
to clean it, but if the climate doesn't accompany

you will have less time to make it.

To leave the deer in rooms. To remove those
bowels, liver, kidneys, to remove the heart.

Calm, calm.

This is a rain of black boxes.

Sr. Burke, Scott Baker, FBI,
I believe that he/she knows because we are here.

They have taken of surprise. Him
would it bother to go up my zipper? Thank you.

I sit down it small you go to
to be alone for a while.

Alex can take my
I work when you want.

MAntén everything in order not
I believe that it delays too much.

Alex remembers, nobody can change the one
world, to the South, you have to go to the South.

When Chris graduated of the high school
he/she had their first car. It managed for the whole country.

It was outside almost the whole summer.

The neighbors will be looking at you... 

So soon I listened that there was
returned I ran to speak with him.

In California he/she met with
some friends of the family.

He/she discovered that the history of love and marriage
of our parents, it was calculated to hide

a terrible truth. When they met each other, dad
it was already married. And before Chris was born

dad already had another son,
of their first Marcia handcuffs.

And they were still legally married.

These facts redefined us
as bastard children.

My father's arrogance didn't allow him/her
to accept the whole pain that had caused.

And my mother in their shameful situation
of lover their accomplice was made.

The fragility of the glass is not
a weakness but a resource.

My parents understood that they should manage
the glass carefully or it would break.

It passed this way my brother, they didn't seem
to know or to care him/her the damage that you/they had caused with

their secret actions.

Their old marriage, and the negation of my
father for his other son, was for Chris... 

a murder of truths every day.

He/she spent all their life giving turns, as a
I laugh that changes the address of their flow.

This revelation made jag
in Chris' identity.

It seemed him/her that its
childhood habá fiction.

Chris never told them that he knew it.

And he/she made me promise
that he/she would never tell them to him.

Not I can pay for the 4,
who can pay for that reason?

Can I help him?
If.

If I want to navigate the river which
would the best place be to begin?

To navigate? That level
of experience you do have?

Not a lot.
Some? Are you beginner?

Beginner?, Beginner so that?

Not you can go I laugh below if you are beginner. If you want to go
for one year and to make you of experience puts you on the list.

Is there a list for that?
If.

Will all have to wait?

The next one available
it is for May 17 of 2003.

Twelve years? It can dry off the river.

You could go in a commercial trip with
a guide, but 2000 dollars would cost you.

Thank you.

You are crazy small!

I Am Supertramp!

If we admit that the human life is governed by the
reason, the possibility of the life would be destroyed.

They come, unite to us.

I Am Mess.
Mess?

Mess.
Alex.

I Am Sonia.

Hello Alex.

Do you come up from river?

And over there the rapids are.

Because if.

He/she came navigating for the rapids.
Don't I believe it?

As in the movies?
In it ascends and it lowers. Be crazy!

If, you made it, you are crazy.

My God!

Take away from my, take away from my.

We go, jump of the boat.

I love this. Don't you like it?

This is nature.

Of where you are?
Not I belong to any side.

You will like then this,
it is good to know you.

We went to THE and then to Las Vegas.

He/she has a spirit that city!,
their universe is so good.

You know about what we speak.
If.

It is one of the best cities.

I love their spirit.

Do you know you to arrive in Mexico through the river?
If.

If, you take the kayak and you navigate until that
place of there, and then all rectum to Mexico.

Seriously?
If.

Sonia, show him/her like it is.

Give him/her, give him/her... 

It is sometimes so slow... 
Here the map is.

As I like you!

They will be 230 km, as 200 miles.
2 thousand miles?

That such if I go the whole route to Baja California?
If, undoubtedly you can.

I will go with you, we will exchange ourselves
in the kayak, we will arrive well in Mexico.

Do you know? for that each man takes
in their heart a Mexican lover.

As you dare before my?
I will change you for a Mexican lover.

I have to leave boys,
I sit down it, I have to leave.

There the patrol car of the river comes and they cannot see me,
because I don't have permission and it should not be here.

If they ask them, you. they don't have me
seen, seriously I sit down it a lot.

Good luck, pleasure in
to know you. Good-bye Alex.

Good-bye, greets Mexico for my.

Good-bye Alex.

It will be navidad in a couple of months, and the last
news that we had were when they found their car.

Me dseperté some days ago and I felt that they were not alone my
parents those that were annoying for you don't know about Chris.

Affection, I am me.

I sit down it, things have happened.

Give me another opportunity.

Please, make it for my.

Right now I don't have more
currencies, could you hurry?

We go, don't hang me.

Here he/she has a currency.
Thank you.

A fallen currency has appeared of the one
sky. So here I am again.

I already put the currency...  no, no, not.

Not you because it was not about calling
in case I responded.

He/she knew that it would not hang if I came out.

For that don't send myself one
letter through a friend?

But he/she told me to my same one that was good.

He/she knew that he/she loved him too much
and that he/she would support not knowing.

And that made me remember that there was
more than the anger, behind everything.

Chris was always rash,
lover of the adventure.

When he/she was 4 years old, he/she left to 6 blocks
of the house at three in the morning.

They found it in the kitchen of a neighbor
on a seat, eating up some candies.

Any thing that this
making should be something very sweet.

Wayne

I hate to have to imagine to a
type salvage like your in a cage.

To walk is this way very easy with
all the money that you paid me.

My days were more exitantes
when he/she didn't have a cent.

I have decided that I go to vicir this
life for a long time to come.

The freedom and the beauty of the simple thing
it is too good to allow it to happen.

Sea of Cortez. December 2 of 1990.

Did you live in a cave for 26 days?
If Sr.

As he/she went that you entered to Mexico?
For the road of the river.

Does the river dry off quickly after that certain point?
Sip.

I arrived for a north connection of the river.
I pushed my kayak for the whole desert.

But after a storm
my kayak was buried.
