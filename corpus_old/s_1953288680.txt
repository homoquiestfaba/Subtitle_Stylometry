Hey, frankie,
let's go have a picnic.

No! I don't trust you!

I got your favorite cupcakes.

Are they real this time?

( screams ) mom!

He's your brother!
Your damn brother!

( grunts )

Get over here!

Where did you get those cameras,
you little punk?

Ow!

Where'd you get those cameras?!

Did you steal them?!

Get back here,
you little fucker!

I'm gonna kill you!

â™ª

â™ª livin' on the edge
of the city limit line â™ª

â™ª this is where the boundary
finally ends â™ª

â™ª and I swear that we're
the last livin' souls â™ª

â™ª in a populated ghost town

( phone rings )

â™ª all the billboards
are our best friends â™ª

( phone rings )

â™ª on the outside of memphis
all the building look big â™ª

â™ª and the white picket fences

â™ª all dare to charge
around the lawn â™ª

â™ª and hold their heads
up high â™ª

â™ª when my headlights
find them out â™ª

â™ª they'll be the first
to put their hands in the air â™ª

( phone rings )

â™ª with my radio on

â™ª singin' a country song

â™ª soft and low

( phone rings )

Mom, I can't talk.

Uh-oh. You sound tense.

<i>I'm not tense.</i>
<i>I'm writing.</i>

Can I call you back?

<i>No, no, no,</i>
<i>it'll only take a second.</i>

<i>What are you writing?</i>

What do you think
I'm writing, mom?

Writing books you never finish
is masturbation, frank.

And I mean that with love,

<i>So don't take it</i>
<i>as an insult.</i>

<i>Anyway, there's a party</i>

On Friday
for your brother,

And he wants you to come.

Mom, I don't see bruce.
I don't talk to bruce.

You know it, he knows it.

It's been three years now!

<i>Get over it!</i>
<i>Mom, I'm hanging up.</i>

I'll call you back.

<i>He's off drugs.</i>

<i>He wanted it to be a surprise.</i>

I know you two have your stuff,

<i>And his counselor</i>
<i>said everyone</i>

<i>Has to go through this</i>
<i>on their own time,</i>

But if you can come
to his graduation thing,

I think you should.

Mom...

I just don't think
it's a good idea.

I'm really into this book and...

I just started a garden.

It looks amazing.

<i>But tell bruce</i>

I'm proud of him.

No, you know what?
I'll tell him myself.

I'll write him a letter.

Oh, my god.

Would you really do that?

<i>And when he finds out</i>
<i>you're not coming</i>

And he overdoses
in a crack house,

We can read it
at his funeral!

( phone slams )

( sighs )

Frank: Fuck!

â™ª I don't need
no complications â™ª

â™ª and I don't need no...

â™ª I don't need
no whiskey chasin' â™ª

â™ª you just set me up
and I'll take it down â™ª

â™ª yeah

â™ª and I don't got
nowhere to be, mama â™ª

â™ª you put on that music
so damn low â™ª

â™ª and I will rock you
slow and easy â™ª

â™ª lots of love
to burn your soul â™ª

( door shuts )

Oh, there you are!
Bruce called.

All the other families
are there. I don't wanna
be late. Chris, he's here!

Hi, mom.

Come on,
the "hi" was implied.

Mwah.

A lot of pictures of bruce.

Bonnie hubbard's son
raped a girl

When he got out of rehab.

We want bruce
to feel loved.

Sure.
Chris!

I'm here!
Stop yelling!

Why are you wearing
the burgundy one?

I suggested the blue!
What? You said red!

Tell your son it's time
for him to move back home.

What?
My people are jewish.

Moses led us out of the desert.

It is disrespectful
to go back.

Would you please stop
picking on him?
If what happened to him

At his wedding happened
to you at your wedding,

You'd wanna hide
in the desert, too.

Oh, so now he's guilty?
Is that what you're saying?

Guilty? Who said anything
about him being guilty?

You did! And you said it
in your own words!

Look at that!
That is not a blue sweater!
That's a gray sweater!

We'll have to use your car.

What's wrong with yours?

We don't have cars right now.

Bruce stole them for drugs.

We said we wouldn't tell him!
Who said we wouldn't tell him?

I'm sorry...
Bruce stole your cars
and sold them for drugs?

Why are you so hard
on your brother?

Drug addiction is a disease.

Would you be mad at somebody
because they got cancer?

If they stole my fucking car,
I would.

Just don't mention it tonight.

Besides, the mopeds are fine.

They're all we could afford.

Apparently,
the insurance company

Doesn't consider it theft
if it's family.

( applause )

Hi, my name is bruce,
and I am an addict
and an alcoholic.

( applause )
bruce: Thank you. Thank you.

Today's a big day for me.
I just came out of rehab.

And today
I am 90 days sober.

( applause )

( whispering )
who's that woman?

( applause )
bruce: Thank you. Thank you.

I know her.

( applause )
bruce: Thank you.

( whispering )
be quiet.
Hmm?

Shh.
Yes.

( applause )
thank you.

My disease
had left me in a...

In a drug-induced sleep.

It was rough,

But even then I had a dream.

Just like this guy.

Just like old marty king.

I had a dream.
( chuckles )

My slavery
was not picking cotton

Or eating gumbo
or whatever,

But it was gin
and it was cocaine,

And I have been released.

( applause )

Thank you.

Today I would like
to thank mom...

And dad and frankie.

This is for you.

( applause )
thank you.

Oh!
Bruce: There they are!

There he is!

Ohh...

Mwah.

You look so great today.

There's my leading man!

Say something, frankie!
Would you not do that, please?

Oh, I'm sorry.

I've been waiting three months
to get this puppy back
in my hands.

Bruce put his
directing career on hold
while he was getting better.

They don't allow
cameras in rehab.

( whispering )
is that really jack knoll?

Bruce ( whispering )
oh, yeah, I never told you.

Jack! Jack,
come over and meet my family.

Two seconds!

( whispering ) we might be
doing a picture together.

With you directing?
Uh-huh.

Oh, did you hear that?
Oh, my god!

When did you become
a director, bruce?

Dude, I've been directing
my whole life.

Don't you remember
all those funny movies you used
to make when you were boys?

He tortured him.
Bruce tortured him on film.

That's not true.

( chuckles )
it's good to see you.

I haven't seen you--
I haven't seen you
since the wedding.

Right?
Yep.

You're not still mad
about that, are you?

Let's just
forget about it, bruce.
Right.

You don't wanna talk about it?
No, not really.

It's just that I kinda
wanted to talk about it.

Do you think it would be okay
just to keep this about now?
That's not a problem.

Jack knoll. Isn't he that
actor with all those guns?
Didn't he shoot somebody?

Hey! Bruce, your old man's
fuckin' gossipin' about me,
man.

I'm just kidding, man.
I'm just kidding. I'm jack.

I love you people.

I just grazed him,
didn't really hurt him.

Listen, your son,
this man here...

Saved my life.

If it hadn't been for him,

I would've just ripped my skull,
right from above my eyebrows,

Just ripped it off
and taken my brains
and smashed them out.

This man is a saint.

Those are sweet words.
Thank you, jack.

Bruce,
are these your parents?

Oh, yes. Um...

You must be so proud.

Dharma,
this is my family.

Are you in show business?

Mom, this's dharma d-cup.

She's been in like
a billion porn movies.

Karen: Really?
Yeah, but I'm done
with all that.

I'm gonna try
and get into real acting.

I'm sure you'll be great.

Thanks.

You're a terrific actor.

What?

You...
You have a talent.

You...
The way you played
that comedy.

It's so rare,
so special.

You're a great actor.
Thank you.

What is he talking about?

Your short.
Your short, man. Super.

What--what short?
My short.

The short that I shot
at ucla film school, bro.
Remember?

About the wedding.

Right. You showed them
my wedding video?

You know what?
It's not actually called
"my wedding video" anymore.

It's called
"the wedding video"
for copyright reasons.

Frank. Frank!

Frank, they didn't
know it was real!

They thought that
you were actor!

And come on, it's not
like a million people
haven't seen it already!

It wasn't a million people,
bruce! It was 18 million people!

Okay, I shouldn't
have shown it to jack
without asking you first.

Oh, you think?

And I shouldn't have
put it on the internet.

That was a mistake.

Okay, frank, I'm sorry!

Did you just say
you were sorry?

I shouldn't have put
your wedding tape
on the internet.

I regret it.
It was a long time ago.

I've been a shitty brother,
but I'm a different person now.

I'm sober...

And I would like us
to start again.

( sighs )

All right, fine.

I'm gonna cook you breakfast
before you go tomorrow.

See ya tomorrow.

I love you, frank!

( horn honks )

Hey! Watch it!

( both groan )

Why aren't you in a car?

What?

This is l.A.
Nobody walks here.

Take a little bit of advice
and learn the lay of the land,
flatfoot.

Yeah, well,
let me give you some advice.
There's a rehab back there.

Are you trying to say
I'm an alcoholic?!

Because that is ridiculous!

Alcoholics don't even
ride bicycles, buddy!

They drive in a car!

So you are that!
You are an alcoholic!

( groans )

Lady, are you--are you okay?

Hey.

Great.

Lady...

Lady.

( sighs )

( inhales deeply )

( horn honks )
oh, fuck!

Where am I?

( sighs )
in a parking lot.

Why am I in a parking lot?

You passed out.

So you stayed with me?

Yeah.

Okay, tell me where you live
and I'll take you home.

( crying )

I don't know
where I live anymore.

I went home today and my--
my fiancÃ©...

I dressed like this
to surprise him.

And then I get home
and he was there...

And he was playing tag.

Tag?

Naked tag...

With the guy
who cleans the pool.

The pool boy, I guess.

And he's like, "babe,
what do you mean you haven't
heard of naked tag before?

You haven't heard of it?"

I'm like,
"no, I haven't heard of it,

"because it's not even a game,
and I'm not an idiot,

So stop saying
that it's a game."

He's like,
"babe, I have an erection,

But it's only because
I'm super competitive!"

And I'm like,
"who's competitive in tag?!"

Have you even
ever heard of anybody
that's competitive in tag?!

No, because it's a game that
you play with your friends!

It's a friendly game!

It's usually
pretty friendly.

He gets me drunk
and then he sits me down
and he just tells me...

Everything.

I'm sorry. God.

I have no idea why
I'm laying all of this on you.

I don't even know you.
I'm really sorry.

No, it's okay.

Really.

( sniffles )

I'm sorry.

Um... ( sighs)

( sniffles )

I don't know
what your plans are,

But do you maybe wanna
like go somewhere?

( sighs )

Yeah, you know,
let's go somewhere.

( sniffles )

Sure.

Okay.

( car starts )
great.

( crying )

Would you mind putting
your seat belt on?

It doesn't matter!

It doesn't
matter if I live or die!

Okay.

( whispering )
oh, wait, no. Wait, wait.

My parents
are asleep in there.

There's a--
there's a place in back.

Oh, shit. That's actually
my brother's stuff.

( sighs )

I made this
when I was a kid.

Cool.

So you don't live here?

No. No, um...

I actually live
in death valley.

What do you do in death valley?

I've just been
kind of camping out
and trying to write this novel.

Okay.
Is this all right?

Um...

Yeah, sure.

So what do you write about?

Um...

Revenge, mostly.

Wait, what is your name?

( chuckles )
frank.

Frank, I'm lassie.

Hi.
Hi.

So, frank,
I was just wondering

If perhaps
you could just want me...
Tonight.

You can do, honestly,
whatever you want to me.

Like really
pretty much anything.

Okay, uh, lassie...
Uh-huh.

Could we maybe kiss first?

Yeah. Yeah.

Okay.

What's the matter?
What? What?

You're not hard. What's wrong?
Am I doing something wrong?

No, we--we just started.

Right, but I mean...

Actually, lassie,
you're kind of squeezing.

I am? Sorry.

Is that better?

Uh, I mean,
you're still squeezing.

Really? Fuck.

Okay, how about that?

Um, that's a little better.

Yeah?

Oh, my god.
You can eat my bra.

I'm not just saying that.
It's edible.

I got it at a sex shop.

It's not toxic.
It's a turn-on.

Lassie, I think
I'm okay for now.

Um, maybe later.

I'll just...
I'll keep it on.

So, yeah.

But you're gonna like--

You will eventually get hard
tonight, right?

I'm just asking.
It'll happen?

It's never been
a problem before.

I think--
I think we'll be fine.

Great.

( sighs )

I'm sorry that I'm crying.
It's stupid.

You must feel like
enough of a failure.

( sniffles )

Which you shouldn't.

Lots of guys
can't get erections sometimes.

God damn it!
I just don't understand
why I'm taking care of you!

Because you know what?

This is actually a really
fucking horrible time

For this
to be happening to me!

I just don't--
I don't understand it!

I don't understand
why nobody will fuck me!

Shh!

Your parents.
Right, I'm sorry. Fuck.

( sniffles )

Thank you.

( sighs )

Fucking hell.

I should just go.
So I'll--I'll go.

You don't have to go.

Really, you don't have to go.

All right.

Okay, I literally
never talk about this.

I found out my fiancÃ©e
was cheating at our wedding.

Really?

We were only getting married
because she was pregnant.

Turns out it wasn't my kid.

Wow.

My best man.

No way.

What'd you do?

I hit her in the face.

( chuckles )
what? Sorry.

It wasn't really a hit.
It was more like a slap.

( sighs )

And then I pulled
her hair a little.

And then I got
an upset stomach and I...

I threw up on her.

It was fucking terrible.

I knew...

I knew that I knew you
from somewhere!

I saw that video!
I saw your wedding video
on the internet!

Yeah, well,
a lot of people did.

Why did you put that
on the internet?!

I didn't.
My brother did.

It's so weird.
My friends used to watch
that video all the time.

They thought it was like
the funniest shit ever.

Yeah.

I never did, though.

I thought that
it was just sad.

Like watching someone
get their heart stepped on
right in front of you.

Or something.

Well, you're like the only
person who ever saw that.

( sniffles )

You still hate her? The girl.

No.

Yeah.

She sounds
exactly like peter.

Just a lying, cheating,
whore bitch.

My god.

Go on.

No, I just think that
that's really selfish

And cruel and evil
and whore-like.

Okay, one more time. Slow.

Oh, okay. Um, okay.

She was--
what was her name?

Sandra.

Sandra is a fucking...

Horrible...

Cunt-face...

Bitch.

And she fucked you up.

She fucked you up
and she sent you
to death valley to die.

Holy shit! Holy shit!

Okay, now stop talking!
I can't believe it!

Stop talking!
I can't believe it!

( birds chirping )

( grunts )

( sighs )

( chuckles )

Morning, mom.

Morning, horn-dog.

I saw your
lady friend leaving.

I'm gonna take a shower.

Oh. Hey, bro.
Hey. Sorry.

I didn't know
you had company.

Oh, no, that's okay.
You remember claudia,
right? My editor.

Oh, we weren't--
we're just friends.

I mean, she'll come over
and let me eat her out
sometimes,

But it's not serious.

Hi, frank.

Oh, wait.
Bro, I wanted to talk to you.

Um, I wanted you to know that
I filmed you and that chick
last night.

And I am glad that I did.

When she hit you
with her bike--

It was awesome.
Bang! Fuckin' love happens.

Italian vibe.
Let's see what happens next.

Like very early cassavetes.

But I heard you loud
and clear last night

When you talked about
wanting to be in the loop
and all that shit.

And here's the deal:
I dropped a copy of what
I filmed off at jack's.

Good for you, baby.
All right, get it back.

He asked me to be honest,
and I've just been honest.

It's pathetic.
Bruce...

Oh, shit!
Let me handle this.

What?
Bro...

I'm sorry.

Okay, I didn't film you two
having the sex,

If that's what
you're worried about it.

I mean I watched it.
But I didn't film it.

Okay. Bruce, you're gonna
give me the address,

And I am gonna go pick up
whatever it is you gave him.

Why are you being like this?
We just had a beautiful moment.

We had another
beautiful moment--
give me the fucking address!

Boys, stop fighting!

I finally get my life in order!

I finally find someone
in the business
who believes in me!

And I ask my baby brother
for one little favor

To help me achieve my dream,
and will he help?

How is jack knoll
seeing a movie

Of a drunken woman
hitting me with her bike helping
you get your dream, bruce?!

Stop fighting!

Because it's funny, man!
It's fuckin' funny!

Not as funny as the stuff
in the clubhouse.

What did you say?
Nothing.

Bro, you just swore to me
that you didn't film me
in the clubhouse.

No, I did not. I swore that
I didn't film you having sex.

And that was true.

But we had sex
in the clubhouse!

We had sex almost immediately
in the clubhouse.

I mean, that's what
we did in the clubhouse.

That depends how
you define sex.
( chuckles )

Personally, I think that sex
involves one of the people
having an erection.

Yeah, that's usually the case.
Will you shut up?!

I'm just saying, it took quite
a while for that to occur.

But when you finally,
finally did achieve
that erection--

And good for you, bro--
but when you did, I cut.

Because, as far
as I'm concerned,
sex is a private thing,

A sacred thing
between two people,
even if it takes a while.

Bruce, bruce--
listen to my rationale.

How many movies
have sex in them?

All of them.

How many movies
have impotence?

None of them.

Impotence makes us pop.

Am I wrong?

Wow, wow, wow,
you just hate that I'm making

Something of my life,
don't you?

You just hate the fact
that I'm a director now.

No, I don't.
You know why?

Because you're
not a director!

You're a fucking pervert
and a freak!

Well, listen to this:
Action! Cut! Action! Cut!

Fucking action!

That's directing, my friend.

Come on, man, just let him
watch it once.

Did it even occur to you
there's another person
in your stupid film?

I mean, did you even
think about that?

Mr. Knoll!

Jack!

Jack?

You're just gonna walk in?

Jack?

Hello?

( oinking )

Bruce: Buddy?

Is this his house?

He must be redecorating.

Jackie boy!

Hey, man!

Hey! Almost done!

What's up?
You look amazing!

Where's all your stuff, bro?
Collection agency.

Said they're coming
for my treadmill this morning.

Let 'em try.
Let 'em try!

He's got a gun.
He has a gun.

That's a gun.
He's virile.

Mr. Knoll...
Call me jack, son!

How's my form?!

Uh, pretty good.

So my brother
dropped off a dvd--
haven't seen it yet!

I thought you said that
you were gonna watch it
before your agent came over.

Agent dropped me as a client!

Said no one'll hire me!
Fuck him!

I should've fired him
years ago!

Got me up for grandpa roles now!

Come here! Look at this!
Come here!

Hit my ass!

Frank, hit it!
Really hit it! Hit my ass!

I'm not hitting his ass.
Punch his fucking ass.

Come on! Hit it hard!

Yah! Damn right!
Does that feel like
a grandpa ass to you?

Not at all.
No.

That ass is harder
than a dick on viagra!

But no, I got an agent who says,
"take the grandpa roles.
They die in the end."

He's a lunatic.
He has a gun.

We're gonna get the dvd
and get the fuck out of here.

Bruce, we gotta do movies
where there's lots of fucking!

Don't worry, I can see it
in your eyes, I'm fine.

Watch this, motherfuckers!

Where's my addiction, bruce?!
Way back there, jack!

Can you see it, bruce?!

Fucking way over there!

Fuck you, addiction!
You cannot catch me!

I win! I win!

You win!
I win!

Come on!
Let's watch your movie!

Action!

<i>Hey! Watch it!</i>

<i>( both groan )</i>

Make him turn it off!
I can't. He's enjoying it.

Jack: Frank, you got talent!

He said you're talented.

Isn't the camera work good?

Oh!
Frank?

Hey.
Jack: What are you doing?

Oh, shit! Get out!

What the fuck was that?

You didn't see that spark?
What?!

What are you doing here?

That'll dry right out.

What are you doing here?

Frank...

You know my daughter?
She's your daughter?

Dad, could you maybe
put some clothes on? Maybe?

This is your dad?
Yeah.

Oh. Hi.

How do you know my lassie?

I... I...
Rehab.

From rehab, last night.
I was late.

I was on my way to see you.
Yep. Exactly.

And I ran into him.
Exactly.

How do you know my father?

My brother was his roommate.

Hey. In rehab.
Brother?

The brother...?
Yep. Mm-hmm.
That one.

I'm gonna finish my workout.
Okay.

God, what a coincidence.

He's an amazing man,
your father.

Oh, jack, don't forget
the treadmill's on!

( thud )
jack: Oh, shit!

But I fell.

Frank:
What is wrong with you?

People are not
just wandering around,

Waiting for you to make
movies about them, bruce.

This is a public space,
frankie.

They don't wanna be filmed,
they shouldn't come here.

Jack: Where are we going?!
Where are you taking me?!

We're going home, dad.
Take me back in there!

You heard the doctor!
He's an orderly.

Don't contradict me,
god damn it!

What's wrong?

He wants drugs.
Jack!

Come here, please.
Please, listen to me, man.

I am in deep pain, man.

The doctor said
I needed some painkillers.

No, the doctor said
advil is fine.

Told me oxycontin.
He did not say oxy--

He did not say oxycontin.
<i>He</i> said oxycontin.

You do not
need it, jack.
Shh.

Give me a darvon.
Okay, jack, listen to me.

Drugs are not your friend.
I am your friend.

And what I'm gonna do
as your friend,

I'm gonna take you
to a meeting.

Can I get your car keys?

I'm gonna take him to a meeting.

Make sure you get that dvd.

I've been abducted!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come here!

Jack! Don't do it, jack!

Give me those fucking pills!

Well, it's nice
to see you again.

Yeah, you really don't
have to say that to me.

What are you talking about?
I mean, I knew you
weren't going to call me.

Which is actually
totally fine, so...

Uh, I already did.
Twice.

Check your phone.

I don't...
Look, frank,

I don't do what we did
last night, okay?

And I know that
lots of girls say that,

But I really never, ever,
ever do that stuff.

Okay.

And now it turns out
that you know my father,
who I want to kill,

And anytime I get sucked back
into his whole crazy world,

It ends very, very badly.
So...

Lassie, I actually
don't know your dad,

But I do know what it's like
to want to kill a relative.

But hey, look...

I'm not trying
to suck you into anything.

I'd just really love
to go out on, like,

A regular date with you,
you know?

We could see a movie.

Maybe get something to eat that
isn't part of your underwear.

( both chuckle )

Oh, my god.

( clears throat )

Hi, everyone,
my name is jack.

Uh, I'm an alcoholic
and a drug addict.

All: Hi, jack.

Drugs and alcohol...

Cost me my career
as a movie star.

And I only say that
in case any of you doubt

That this disease
can take away

The things
that you love the most.

That's what happened to me.

Uh, just one more thing...

If any of you ladies
wanted to have sex with me

Back when I was a somebody
and didn't get a chance...

Meet me out back.

I also have a pool.

( applause )

Ever work at a strip club?

Bruce?
Yeah?

Hi, my name's david.
Hi.

This is my wife natalie.
Hello.

We related to everything
you said in the meeting.

We wanted to be
in the movie business
our whole lives.

And when we got sober,
we swore we would finally do
what we were supposed to do.

That's why we
started our company.

Los angeles pictures.

<i>Los angeles.</i>

Angels.

Did you know that
angels are everywhere?

I did not know that, david.

There's one
standing next to you.

Don't be afraid.

That's sonya.
She follows us.

Did you come with jack knoll?

Are you friends?

Jack? Yeah, big time.
Good friend.

No, hit it, hit it, hit it.

Do you think that you and jack
would be interested in

Making movies with us
about angels?

Thanks to dentistry,
we have plenty of money.

Oh. You guys are like
christian tooth fairies.

( all laugh )

That's amazing!
We're ready to go!

Oh!

We're just looking for
like-minded artists to join us.

You know what's weird?

Jack, only yesterday,
was talking about

How much he loves angels.

( gasps )
oh, my god.

It's a miracle.
It's a miracle.

So, how much money
do you guys have?

( both laugh )

We have a lot.
Shh.

Uh-oh. Shh.

Shall we pray?

Let's!
Let's pray!

Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
claudia...

Shh. Shh. Shh.
Be very quiet.

Help! Mom!

Shut the fuck up!

Okay, okay! Just do it!

( gasps )

( door opens )

Hey, bro.
Where you been?

Well, jack and I
went to a meeting.

After which I was
approached by some
very serious film producers.

I need my keys.
I'm late to meet lassie.

Okay, have a good time.

You got the dvd, right?

Weren't you supposed
to get the dvd?

How do you know
he's not home?

He stayed for
another meeting.

So, where you
gonna take lassie?

Just get the dvd
out of the player
and stop talking.

Why are you always
so mean to me?

It's fucking gone!

Shh. He's sleeping.

Frank: Fine.

Where are you going?

I'm going to get it.

What if he has an alarm?

You think he has an alarm?
He has no furniture!

But you think he's
gonna pay for an alarm?

Use your head, frankie!

I'm sorry!
I'm not a god damn criminal!

Yeah, well,
it's just as well,

Because you'd be
a terrible one.

Bruce, the guy has guns!
I know he has guns!

And he will use them on us
if he ever watches that video.

So are you gonna
help me get it back?

Or are you gonna
stand out here all night
and whine like a little bitch?

Oh, I'm a bitch?
I'm a bitch?

Then how come
you're the one

Always sucking
jack knoll's balls?

He's my friend!

( squeals )

The pig is in the pool.
The pig is in the pool?!

Fuck.
He's fine.
He's swimming.

What are you talking about?!
Pigs can't swim!

Jack shouldn't have
kept a pig by the pool.

It's irresponsible.
It's not our fault.

We are not
leaving him in there!

Fine, you go get him.
You get him!

I'm going on a date
after this!

I can't swim!
What?!

I can't swim, frankie!
I never have!

I don't like water!
I can't even drink the stuff!

Fuck!

( gasps )

I think he's dead!
I think he's dead!

Heimlich him!
Heimlich him?!

Do it! Heimlich him!
Squeeze his little belly!

Oh, shit!

( squeals )

Is that a condom?

Yeah, that's definitely
a condom.

Get it off!

Who the fuck is out here?!
Jack! Jack! It's bruce!

Don't shoot, don't shoot!
What are you doing here?

I was worried about you.
Hey, dharma d-cup.

And I thought it would be good
if I could be here when
you got home.

And it's a good thing
that we were, because your pig
fell in the pool, man.

Is he all right?
He's fine.

We saved him.

Mr. Knoll...

Since we're already here,

Would you like us
to get the dvd player fixed?

That's a good idea, frankie.

Jack: Oh, don't worry about it.

My housekeeper
took it home with her.

Her husband fixes 'em.

( latin hip hop playing )

Hey, guys.

We're looking for
ramon and celia.

They just left
right now, bro.

Right. Um, do you know
where they went?

None of your business.

You're done now?

What's up, homes?

Listen, cecilia,
the chiquita who lives here,

She works for a guy
called jack knoll.

You know jack knoll?
He's a big tv actor.

You don't have a tv.
That's okay.

Jack's a really good amigo
of mine,

And he sent me over
to just grab something from--

They just left. If you
wanna come back a little--

Maybe we'll just
have a quick look.

Maybe I'll just
break your fucking legs
if you take another step.

Oh, you're gonna do it?

Okay. You're a lot bigger
standing up.

Frank: Sorry to disturb you.
Just get the fuck out of here.

You see that?

( clattering )

I can see it!
It's just here!

Oh, my god.

You have to do it.

What?
You have to go in.

I swore on my sobriety that
I wouldn't steal anymore, frank.

And besides,
breaking and entering
a stranger's home

Is definitely a felony,
and I've already
got two strikes!

If you think you're going
to manipulate me and get me--

Fine! I'll go. I'll do it.
That's fine.

Bruce! Neither of us
should do it!

But, frank, if I get caught
and go down for 30 years,

Will you do me a favor?

Promise you won't put mom
in a nursing home.

Frank: Wait! Wait!

Stop pushing me!
Okay.

( clattering )
ugh!

You okay?

( tv playing )

( speaking spanish )

( speaking spanish )

( grunting )

( speaking spanish )

Aah!

What are you doing?!
He's attacking me!

Shake him off!
He's really strong!

Frank, frank! Stab him!

What?!
Take this knife and stab him!

I'm not fucking stabbing him,
bruce!

He's a million years old,
it doesn't matter!

Okay, just bring him over here!
I'll stab him!

Aah! He fucking bit me!

Give me the dvd player!

( speaking spanish )

Frank, good luck.

Bruce! Bruce!

What the fuck?!

It really took you
14 hours to get me out?

When bruce gets arrested,
we always let him
spend the night.

Your mother and I decided
we shouldn't play favorites.

Bruce is a fucking criminal!

Ex-criminal.

And you're scarcely
in any position to judge.

Here.

Come on.

Stop sign!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

Ah, there we go.

( phone rings )

Hello.

I am so sorry about last night.

Don't even worry about it.
Bruce called me.

He told me all about
your father's scare.

Are they sure
that it's not a heart attack?

Yeah, he's...

They said he's fine.

Good.

So, you wanna
get together later?

Right. Well...

Frank, I just don't think
that I have the time.

Right. Okay.

The relief organization
that I work for,
they just offered me

This position in china
that I'm thinking about taking.

<i>So, it's just</i>
<i>kinda crazy right now.</i>

But if I'm ever
in death valley,

Then, you know,
I'll absolutely give you a call.

Okay.

Okay. Have a safe trip.

( beeps )

Ow! Fuck. Ow.

Hey, bro. I got it.

All broken up.

I also got all the tape.
That's for you as well.

And don't worry, jack's maid
isn't gonna press charges.

Are you okay, bro?

Did someone
touch you in prison?

Look at me and tell me
you don't have any more copies.

( sighs )

I swear on my sobriety

That I don't have
any more copies.

Now swear that
no one else has any.

Bruce:
Okay, since your impotence

Is apparently
so embarrassing to you,

I had claudia
completely re-edit my movie.

Which means, technically,

I don't even have
to show it to you.

Because as you will soon see,

This movie no longer
has anything to do with you.

But I'm happy
for you to see it,

Because you're my brother
and I love you.

Claudia,
play it for him.

Well, what you're about to see,
in my opinion,

Is a serious step back
from the integrity
of bruce's original work.

Would you just press play,
please.

Okay, will you just
stop yelling at me?
You're being rude.

Just play it.

â™ª

What's wrong?
What's wrong?
<i>What? What?</i>

( sped-up voice )
you're not hard.
What's wrong wrong?

Am I doing something wrong?
<i>No, no, no. We just started.</i>

<i>Um, actually,</i>
<i>you're kind of squeezing.</i>

I originally planned to put
fuzz face on the genitals,

But it's actually a lot funnier
with genitals.

Especially since you were
having so much trouble
with your genitals.

I'm sorry.
Who the fuck are you?!
Bruce: This is arthur.

Arthur, this is frank.
Arthur's a bigwig
in the whole fuzz-face game.

And what exactly did you
plan to do with this?

It's gonna be submitted to
a sex-tape site in the valley.

It's a do-it-yourself
fornication and lighting
emporium

Called choose a lamp
and go fuck each other dot com.

Please get hard!
Please get hard!
Please get hard!

Aah!

Oh, shit!

Claudia: Frank, you ungrateful
little bitch!

We did this so you wouldn't
have to be embarrassed!

Aah!

( frank and bruce grunting )

Hey, idiots, I uploaded it
without the fuzz face.

Now your film is gonna be seen
the way it was meant to be seen.

( grunting )

What?!

<i>Are you into lesbians?</i>

<i>That's a thing</i>
<i>with guys, right?</i>

The girl
is jack knoll's daughter!

Great art hurts, bruce!

Mmm, boobs.
I love your boobs. Mmm.

( tires screech )

( horn honks )
do not honk my horn!

Can you go around him?
Oh! Oh! Oh!

Look who's suddenly nervous
about someone seeing the movie!

Yes, I am nervous
about being killed!

As soon as he sees that video,
you don't think he's
gonna kill you, too?

I am nervous about
being actually shot!

Not about the possibility
of maybe somebody
on the internet

Seeing my embarrassing wiener!

( grunting )

Bruce: Open hand! Open hand!

Hey.
Excuse me?

Kip. Hip.
It's him. It's him.

( laughs )
ah, your video was dope, dog.

I'm the director.

The most original
sex tape ever made, right?

Shut your mouth.
We'd like it back.

I mean,
a sex tape with no sex:

That is just like...
Genius.

Yeah, it was great.

The thing is, it was actually
sent to you by mistake.

So, we're really gonna
need you to destroy it.

I can't do that.
Once it goes up,
it's up for 72 hours.

Wait, wait wait.
You're saying it's on
the internet now?

Come check it out.
You got some great
feedback, dog.

Dad! Cut it
with the welding, man!
Come on!

Is that all for me? Oh, my god.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's you.

Here's the deal:
Either take it
down right now or--

Is five boners good?
Five boners is great.

That's five out of five?
Five out of five boners.

And they're
real stingy with boners.

Yeah, they don't give boners
for anybody.

Dad, we have customers!

Pal, pal,
you wanna negotiate?
No, I don't.

They call me alfred bitchcock.

( laughs )
that's hilarious.
That is funny.

I don't know
what that means, though.

You want a car?
I don't want a car.

I got a '93 honda
right outside.

I have a dui
and I drive a vespa.

Kinky in kuala lumpur
thinks that I'm a visionary.

If other men are on our site
and they see a guy like you,

Having trouble
getting an erection,

Keeping an erection,
forming an erection...
Right.

I think that
they'll feel a lot
better about themselves.

I don't want to be too forward,
but would you like to get some
coffee or something later?

Any time.
Oh, that'd be great.

Oh, wait, did you
mean romantically?

Most certainly romantically.

Bruce, can we leave, please?
Sure.

All right.
Hey, send us more stuff.

Seriously, guys,
you cannot fucking mess with
people's lives like this!

( whispering )
I really appreciate
your support.

You will take this down,
or you will face
the fucking consequences!

( whispering )
I will call you.

Do you think
I didn't just see that?

You heard the guy.
They've only got like
15,000 subscribers, tops,

Mostly in asia, and he's gonna
take it down in 72 hours.

I'm not waiting 72 hours!

Why are you so embarrassed
about your impotency?

I don't have impotency!

I had a brief
one-time-only episode.

It happens to everyone.
I was impotent last night.

I know. I was.
I mean, I had just
watched your video.

So it was probably some kind of
fraternal sympathy softie.

But even so, claudia
had to put three fingers

Up my ass last night
to get me hard.

I understand your pain.
We're family.

Hey. David!

No, this is a good time.
I've just come from church.

Lassie:
<i>Do you want me to hum?</i>
<i>It's just my jaw hurts.</i>

Mother of god...

Okay, dad, that's enough.

Well, that was excruciating.

Just tell me
you can get it down.

This is outside
of our area of expertise,

Although sydney
did just email me
that it is illegal

To film someone
in an unflattering manner
without their knowledge.

And that was
definitely unflattering.

Oh, dad!

What? Sidney, he's my partner.

How am I suppose to help you
if I don't know what's
going on?

I think you should call
judge collins and have him
issue a take-down order.

Oh, here's his number.
Thank you, dear.

Oh, you gotta be kidding me!
You showed the intern?!

Everything here
is confidential.

They're dentists?
That's right,
and they are super rich, mom.

And they wanna make a movie
with jack and I.

That's fantastic.
I know.

I'd love to have you
involved in some way.

Me?
Of course.

It's been too long since you
and I have created art together.

When did you two
ever make art together?

My painting.

Don't you remember
I sat for that?

Ugh. Yes.

Great things are happening.

Sobriety has worked wonders
with your life.

Excuse me. Am I invisible?

Your beautiful sober son
just put me in a porn video
without my permission.

Oh, stop it. There is nothing
in that video that earn it

The title of porn
and you know it.

You watched it?!
You showed it to mom?

You showed it to dad.
To help get it down!

Mom, why would you watch that?

I watch all of bruce's films.

Besides,
there is nothing wrong

With a mother seeing
her son's penis in repose.

Had you gotten aroused,
I would've stopped watching.

Can we stop talking about this?
I am seeing a judge tomorrow.

And all of this
is gonna be behind us.

Stop being
such a drama queen.

Mom, I'm on a web site
where people fuck fruit.

It is not people, it is one man,
and it's very funny.

And don't talk
with your mouth full.

Oh, my god. Please be poison.

When did he become
such a prude?

Yeah, you know,
I hate to say it,

But I think I agree
with her on this one.

I mean, what was the point
of your mother and I having sex

With the door open
if we were raising a puritan?

( all laugh )
dad?

Thank you, my darling.

( phone rings )

May I be excused?

Oh, look who's
finally being polite.

You know, some nights
I really miss the sound
of you guys making love.

Yeah, me, too.

Lassie: I'm so sorry.
I didn't know who else to call.

What is going on?

( gunshot )
I swear to god,

If you fire one more shot,
I'll fucking kill you!

My fiancÃ©!

( gunshots )
my fiancÃ© called him
and told him everything!

I have no idea
what he was thinking!

So of course
my dad just totally flips out
and he goes to grab his gun!

So I just locked him
in there in the shed!

And is this a normal reaction
to a situation like this?

He's freakishly
protective of me
in his own weird way.

Jack!
Hey, buddy, it's bruce!

Jack: Stay out of this!

I'm gonna open the door,
but you have to give me
your gun.

No!
The thing is, jack,
it's really not cool

To shoot people anymore.

It's illegal.

Besides, I've got
really good news.
What news?

I am opening the door.

Oh, my god.

Give me the gun.

What's the news?

I got us producers. Yeah.
Oh, really?! You did?!

Why don't you just take drugs?
Just take drugs again.

Why would you say that?

Because you are just as bad--

You're worse, actually,
when you're sober.

So please, I am begging you
to take drugs, jack.

First of all, I don't think
you should be calling me jack.

I think you call me dad.

Hey.

Hi.

You okay?

You sure you're okay?

Sorry if I'm giving you
mixed messages.

I don't really think
that it takes a genius

To figure out why
I'm a little bit...
Confused.

I think we're all
a little bit confused.

Thanks for being
a good guy.

I'm really not.

No, you really are.

What do you mean, the judge
thinks we should leave it up?

Well, apparently,
these gossip websites
bribe clerks

To alert them when people
get down sex tapes,

In case there's
a celebrity involved.

Anyway, lassie
is a celebrity's kid,

And there's only
48 hours left,

So the judge thinks
it's just not worth the risk.

Okay, you know what?
Fuck it.

Hey, mom. Can I borrow
one of dad's ties?

I got my meeting
with the producers
and I wanna look fancy.

Oh, of course you can.
Where are you going?

I'm doing what
I should've done
from the very beginning.

I'm telling lassie.

Why?
The judge can't
get down the sex tape.

What? No, wait--

I'm not asking your permission.

No, I told you, man.
She's never gonna see it.

I'm telling lassie
and going home.

Can you believe that pussy
came from your pussy?

What about phil?
Maybe he can help.

Who's phil?
Phil...

I love you, mom.

( chuckles )

His cell mate from prison.

The guy who eats rats?

Don't be so negative!

He hacked into a bank
and got 20 million dollars.

He's not just some guy
that eats rats.

Hey, phil, it's bruce.
Long time, man.

I'm actually just calling
'cause I need a favor.

( whispering )
he's talking to his friend,
the ex-con. He eats rats.

Don't tell mother
I told you.

Yeah, is it okay
if I send over my brother?

What?! I'm not going!
He's a computer whiz!

He can get the sex tape
off the internet!

He's a rodent-eating
ex-convict I don't know.

Hey, we're both coming.

Hello?

Hello?

Phil?

Hi.

Um, is phil here?

( deep voice )
hello, bruce.

Phil?

It's phyllis now.

Oh, my god!
That's weird.

I'd like
to introduce you to frankie.

Oh, the brother. Charmed.

Kiss the hand.

Mmm.
Oh.

Come in, boys.

â™ª

( inhaling deeply )

Oh, no.
I am clean as a whistle.

I'm impressed.

( exhales )

( sighs )

Oh. No, thanks.

It's not nice to make
a lady party alone.

Especially when she's
doing you a favor.

Right.

So, uh, phil...
Do you think maybe

We could get this movie
down off the internet?

It's phyllis.

Yes, it is.

I get so horny
when I smoke pot.

You, too?

( exhales )

You know, I hope you don't
take this the wrong way,

But I found your film
very healing.

( sighs ) I've had a lot
of sadness lately.

A lot of new girls do.

Grieving the lost phallus,
it's normal.

It's so normal.

But I have to tell you,

When I saw what happened
to you last night,

Good lord,
I didn't miss my cock one bit.

Would you like to see it?

My phallus.

( chokes )

I asked if I could keep it.

I keep it in a jar.

Well, I mean, not all of it.

Some of it they had to use
to construct my vagina.

It's an amazingly
interesting procedure.

You don't have to go into
all of that for us, phyllis.

You be nice
to your auntie phyllis...

You little shit.

No, no. Frankie didn't...

Frankie would love to hear
all about your penis operation.

It's just we're kind of in
a hurry to get the video down.

( bang )

Why has no one
asked to see them?!

Your tits?

I'd fucking love
to see your tits.

And how about you, frankie?
Fancy a peek?

Um...

Phyllis: I will not help people
who don't support me!

What is your problem?
What did I do?

You hesitated!
When someone offers
to show you their tits,

You don't hesitate, you look!

Bruce, I don't even
know this guy!

Why should I
look at his tits?!

Phyllis:
<i>Her!</i> Motherfucker!

That's it.
I'm done helping you.
Bruce!

I'm not gonna be late
for my meeting to watch you
abuse my lady friends, frank.

Bruce, I'm sorry!

Don't say it to me!

( car door shuts )

( engine starts )

Phyllis?

It's me again.

â™ª

â™ª when you look at me

â™ª or when you think of me

â™ª don't scold me

â™ª but understand

â™ª I don't know everything

You're a very good dancer,
frank. ( chuckles )

â™ª I'm just a man

â™ª when I look at you

Listen, I would
really like to...

But I'm actually seeing
someone right now,

And I'm kind of
old-fashioned that way.

Please don't be mad.

She's a very lucky girl.

So... Do you think you could...
( exhales )

Maybe help with the sex tape?

Well... ( inhales )

Since you
couldn't get it up,

I may as well get it down.

( both laugh )

Let's see what we have here.

I really appreciate it,
phyllis.

You know...

There is something
you could can help me with.

Anything.
I have this date tonight, and I
really, really like this lady.

I think I might be a lesbian.
You don't have any problem
with that, right?

No.

Well, I got waxed
for the very first time.

You know...

Down there.

( gulps ) mm-hmm.

At the end of the day,
I went with the brazilian.

And, god, I hope
I didn't make a mistake.

I just want everything
to be pretty.

Would you like...

Would you like me
to take a look?

Oh...

Would you?

Yep.

Okay.

Natalie: Mmm.

Oh, lord,
again we thank you so much

For jack and for bruce.

In your name we pray. Amen.

All: Amen.

Good, good.

Thank you. Thank you.

And we also wanted to talk
to the two of you about, um...

Sex.
Yeah!

Uh-huh.

Well, you see,
my wife and I, we're celibates.

Shut up.

We've taken
a lifelong vow of chastity.
Oh, my god.

Oh, we don't expect you
to live a similar lifestyle.

Oh.
Oh, dear no.

We could never.
No.

But we do feel very strongly
about our films being sex-free.

Sex-free?

Yes.
( groans )

You want a film
with no sex in it?

Correct.
Yes.

Lots of angels.
Zero sex.

Is that going to be a problem?

Maybe.
No.

Phyllis!

Oh, I love you, phyllis.

Lassie: Look at us.
We're on regular date,
like regular people.

It's nice.
It's a miracle.

When do I get
to read your book?
Because I kinda want to.

Probably never.
I'm pretty sure it sucks.

I'm pretty sure
it sucks, too,

But I still
wanna read it.

I won't judge you.

Maybe the next one.

Excuse me.

Hey, it's you.

Love the video, dude.
Fuckin' hysterical.

Sorry, this happens
all the time.

Seriously, seriously.

It's the funniest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

You know it got
like a million hits
in three hours today?

Awesome. Fuck off.
You know? Thanks.
Yeah, fuck off.

Oh, it's her!
My god.

I do not know how
you handle that shit.

Eat my bra! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
Eat my bra! Yeah!

What did he say?
I don't know.

I don't think
he was talking to us.

What?

Lassie: <i>We could act out</i>
<i>your masturbation fantasies.</i>

<i>Maybe that would get you hard.</i>

Someone must've pirated a copy
off the original site before
I shut it down.

I'll be a cheerleader

And you be the captain
of the football team.

Maybe you just need
some kind of encouragement.

I'll cheer you on.
I'll cheer you on.
I'll cheer you on.

Please get it down, phyllis.
I'll do whatever you want.

We can dance.
I'll look at your penis.

Frank...
Get the jar.
Does it open?

Frank! Frank!
I'll touch it!

Frank, I know how you feel.

You're embarrassed...

And you're ashamed...

And you want to die.

The exact same way
I felt when the guys
on my high school team

Walked into the locker room
and I was dressed
in a cheerleader's uniform.

But it was at that moment
I got a glimpse

For the first time
of my true me.

And that is what
I want for you, darling.

Let your humiliation
set you free.

Come here. Come here.

That's a very nice shampoo
you're wearing.

Oh, now he'll never
work with me.

Jack? Don't be silly.
He adores you.

Mom, he tried to shoot a guy
who cheated on his daughter.

I put her in a sex tape,
which is now being viewed

By eight million people
since breakfast.

It's not a real sex tape.
It's just a funny little movie.

That's it.
What?

It's a movie!

I will just tell jack
that what I shot

In the clubhouse
was a teaser for a larger film.

What's the film?

I'll work that out!
It writes itself!

Hi.
Hey.

I'm so glad that you called.

My dad is at a meeting,
but I ordered us some dinner.

So I hope you're hungry.

Here. Sit.

I actually have
something to tell you.

It's kind of the reason
we're having chinese food.

You're going to china?

The opposite.
I told them no.

It's just kind of
the worst time for me to go.

It might have a tiny
little bit to do with you.

You all right?

You do these?

I was really into knights
when I was a kid.

"a strong, kind man
dipped in metal."

Listen, it's actually
a very normal fantasy

For a girl whose father
has never been in
a relationship, ever.

You can connect the dots
and see why perhaps I was
in need of some chivalry.

So... What did you
want to tell me?

I'll tell you later.

( phone rings )

( grunts )

( phone rings )

( sighs )

Hey.

Thank you
for the date yesterday.

It was really, really nice...
And normal.

Listen, lassie,
can I talk to you
about something?

I'm actually just running
into a meeting right now.

Can I give you a call back
in a little bit?

<i>Oh, and your brother,</i>

<i>He stopped by</i>
<i>and he took your car.</i>

He said he needed to trade it
for a crane or something.

I don't know.
He said you'd understand.

( beeps )

( sighs )

Hey, sorry I'm late.

What's going on?
<i>This is actually a really</i>
<i>fucking horrible time</i>

For this to be happening to me!
What?

<i>I just don't--</i>
<i>I don't understand it!</i>

<i>I don't understand</i>
<i>why nobody will fuck me!</i>

But everyone else has sex,
why can't we?

Bruce: "why can't I?"

Everyone else has sex,
why can't I?

Behold. I am an angel,
sent by god, to make you pure.

Bruce:
Dad! I'm gonna need more wings!

Chris: What?
Bruce: More wings!

Bruce...
Bruce: Cut, cut!

Isn't this fucking amazing?

What is this?
I'm making a movie
of that night.

What night?
The night
in the clubhouse, bro.

Okay, everybody, places.
We're going again.

No, actually not places.

Could everyone just
pack this stuff up and go home?

I'm sorry.
Frankie, stop being such a girl!

Do not disrespect me
in front of my crew, okay?

I will slap you down.
I will fucking slap you down.

All I'm doing here is trying
to make everyone else happy.

The producers want an angel.
Jack won't do the movie
unless dharma is in it.

Jack is in the movie?!
Of course jack's in the movie!
Jack's the money!

But he won't do it
unless dharma's in it,
who can't fucking act!

Stop fighting, both of you!

And I am doing
all of this, bro,

Just to make sure
that you and cassie

Don't get embarrassed.

Bruce...
What?!

Isn't jack
supposed to be in this scene?

Could everybody just stop
talking to me?! Please!

Okay, we're going again!
Last time! Rolling sound!

Bruce!
Action!

Don't listen to the a--
to the angel.

Have sex. Have sex now.

Bruce: Angrier!

Have it all the time!

Oh, fuck!

What are you doing here?
Tell me that you didn't know
that he filmed us that night!

I didn't.
I swear to god, I didn't.

Well, did you know that
it was on the internet?!

Bruce: Cut! Places!
We're going again!

Oh, my god.

Action.
Oh.

Why won't anyone
have sex with me?

Wait...

Is that an angel?

I forbid the blood
to enter your cock.

Rise, pes--
penis, rise!

Bruce, could you have her
say "phallus" instead?

What is all of this?

Fill with blood!
Fill that member!

Bruce is making a movie
so... ( sighs )

So that we won't
have to be embarrassed.

What are you talking about?

Sex out of wedlock is wrong.

Get that member
filled with pleasure!

I forbid the blood
to enter your cock.

Phallus!
I forbid the blood
to enter your phallus.

I'm the devil!
Fuck that pussy!

...To enter your phallus.

You big penis!
Could she say "organ" instead?

Motherfucker!
Come here!

Did you put
my precious daughter
in a porno video?!

You are fucking dead!
Do you hear me?!

Oh, shit!
Time to die, motherfucker!

( gunshot, screams )

Bruce! Bruce!

Fuck! Okay, okay.

Someone call an ambulance!
Call 911! Call 911!

He shot me in my belly.
I know, bro. I know.

Just keep breathing.
Just keep breathing.

( groans )
just keep breathing.

( chuckles )
I knew you loved me, bro.

You! When you grab me
and put me against the wall,
you gotta really hold me!

You wanna go again, jack?
Let's go!

He doesn't know anything.

He just thinks that
he's playing the part
of a father

Who found out his daughter's
in a sex video. It's fine.

You're such a fucking asshole!

What?
What's the matter with you?!

I just want an option
in case we decide to go dark
in the end, bro.

Lassie, I'm sorry.
Leave me alone.

Lassie--
leave me alone!

But it looked
that realistic?

â™ª hold on to hope, love

â™ª I searched high and low
for you â™ª

( phone rings )

â™ª for you

â™ª each day gets closer

â™ª so hold on stronger
to me â™ª

( phone rings )

( grunts )

â™ª someday soon

â™ª I'll find you

( phone rings )

â™ª someday soon

â™ª I'll know you

â™ª someday, ooh

â™ª yeah, oh

( phone rings )

Mom, stop fucking calling!

It's not your mother.

Unfortunately,
I can't bear children.

Whatever.

<i>I saw bruce's movie,</i>
<i>along with,</i>

<i>Oh, I don't know,</i>
<i>a few million other people.</i>

And what the fuck
was he thinking,
not letting me play the angel?

That woman
was absolute dog shit.

So, you still talk to that girl?

<i>She still mad at you?</i>

She won't take my calls.

She hasn't respond
to any of my emails.

Yeah, I heard
through the grapevine
that she's going away.

<i>Poor thing.</i>
<i>Where?</i>

<i>China.</i>

You think you're embarrassed?

Try havin' half the planet
watch some guy

Not be able to fuck you
all night.

That's embarrassing, my friend.

Anyway...

<i>I thought you should know</i>
<i>she's going away...</i>

Just in case one of the people
on this phone call

Wanted to start
acting like a man, darling.

<i>Let your auntie phyllis</i>

<i>Give you a piece of advice,</i>
<i>frankie-baby.</i>

I don't give a shit
how many people

Saw what happened
in that clubhouse that night,

And I don't care
what they thought about it.

They weren't there.
They were just watching.

If you really fell in love
with that girl that night,

Then what the fuck are you
still doing in the desert?

( horn honks )

( horn honks )

Francis...

Hey, bro.

( car door shuts )

Listen, I know
we haven't talked since
the whole angel debacle,

And I just wanted
to say I'm really sorry.

After you left,
I got to thinking...

Maybe I'm incapable of change.

But, look, no camera.

Wow, I'm impressed.
Right?

You proud of me?

What time's her flight?
Uh, 7:00 pm.

We better hit the road
before we lose the light.

Hey, bruce,
can you help me
with something in here?

Sure.

You need a strong guy?
Yeah.

What is it?

Frank! What are you doing?!

You're not filming this, bruce!

What?!

Plenty of food
and water in there!

There's even a mirror
in case you wanna jerk off!

Tv gets channel six!

I swear on mom's tits,
I'm not gonna film you!

Okay, maybe one shot!

Bruce: Maybe two!
A master from far away!

Bro, I just want to give you
a happy ending!

Frank! I love you!

â™ª I know the nervous walking

â™ª I know the dirty beard

â™ª hangs out
by the boxcar waiting â™ª

â™ª take me away
to nowhere plains â™ª

â™ª there is a wait so long

â™ª so long, so long

â™ª never wait so long

Hey!
Dad! Tell us
when people come in!

â™ª here comes your man

Excuse me?

â™ª here comes your man

â™ª here comes your man

I am a strong, kind man
dipped in metal.

Dipped in metal.

And I have come to take you
away from all of this...

And to protect you
and to defend you...

And to apologize
for sucking at it so far.

Lassie, I know
all about embarrassment.

Eighteen million people saw me
throw up on my fiancÃ©e,

And 35 million people
saw my dick not work.

I'm standing in front of you
wearing a car.

Don't go.
It won't help.

Frank...

I really appreciate
all of this effort.
I just...

I can't live here anymore.
I have to go.

I'm sorry.

Come?

Come and visit me.

I could probably
use a knight.

I might have a little trouble
with the metal detector.

â™ª

( cheering and applause )

( record scratches )

( music playing in reverse )

â™ª

( bruce's voice )
wow, I've never had sex
with a knight before.

( bruce's voice )
I'm gonna fuck you
on the round table, bitch.

Bruce: Cut!

â™ª

â™ª

( inhales deeply )

( exhales )

Ahh.

Ahh.

Felt real to me.

Mmm.

â™ª

â™ª picture they took of you
in your cowboy hat â™ª

â™ª makes you look like
you are one of the boys â™ª

â™ª out on a Saturday night

â™ª meanwhile on the outside
of the dance hall â™ª

â™ª I'm a joke
that you'd probably enjoy â™ª

â™ª on the outside of memphis
all the building look big â™ª

â™ª and the white picket fences

â™ª all dare to charge
around the lawn â™ª

â™ª and hold their heads
up high â™ª

â™ª when my headlights
find them out â™ª

â™ª they'll be the first
to put their hands in the air â™ª

â™ª with my radio on

â™ª singing a country song

â™ª soft and low

â™ª living on the edge
of the city limit line â™ª

â™ª this is where the boundary
finally ends â™ª

â™ª and I swear that we're
the last living souls â™ª

â™ª in a populated ghost town

â™ª all the billboards
are our best friends â™ª

â™ª oh, which way
did our last chance go? â™ª

â™ª and can we get out
if we go right now? â™ª

â™ª 'cause it seems
that with the malls â™ª

â™ª and the mega-church stadiums

â™ª we would get out
if we knew just how â™ª

â™ª with the radio on

â™ª singin' a country song

â™ª soft and low

â™ª oh, when I've got
a worried mind

â™ª I know

â™ª I hear the ghost
of patsy cline â™ª

â™ª on the grand old opry show

â™ª standing in line
to get my self-help book â™ª

â™ª signed off on by the reverend
who shouts to the converted â™ª

â™ª have mercy on this boy
he did it all by the book â™ª

â™ª but still kind of
has his doubts â™ª

â™ª yeah, you look pretty good
in that jonquil dress â™ª

â™ª but your smile
is a wooden nickel's pride â™ª

â™ª and I know that
it ain't worth much â™ª

â™ª but it feels good to touch

â™ª and I think that
I could dance if I tried â™ª

â™ª with your radio on

â™ª singin' a country song

â™ª soft and low

â™ª oh, when I've got
a worried mind â™ª

â™ª I know

â™ª I hear the ghost
of patsy cline â™ª

â™ª on the grand old opry show
