[kissing noise]

screech!

Busted.

Catherine the Great
gave birth to a son.

Peter continued
to heap abuse on her

because he was suspicious
of the child's origin.

No one in the contemporary court
really believed the child was his,

but no one really cared,
because the empress finally had an heir.

<i>Any questions?</i>

<i>Any confusion?</i>

Any anything?

[upbeat music]

? ?

Professor Jenkins.

Professor Jenkins.

Oh, hello, Steven.

You dropped this.

Thank you.

You look
really nice today.

[phone ringing]

Hello.

So when are you
coming home this weekend?

<i>I'm not coming.</i>

You're coming.

Julie, l'm not coming.

l just got my car fixed,
theoretically,

<i>I have a student
who's willing</i>

<i>to go above and beyond
the call of duty in getting an A,</i>

and l just can't handle Mother's
high drama this weekend.

<i>It's your parents'</i>

45th wedding anniversary.

You're coming.

l-l'm not coming.

l'm not going.

<i>I'm not going.</i>

Yes, you are.

<i>And, Brad?</i>

Happy birthday.

l'm not going.

Bumpity bumpity bumpity bump.

God, l loved riding
that pony as a kid.

What was it?

1 4 vaginal orgasms

<i>in less than an hour.</i>

Not that Jackson
isn't sufficient,

but at first,
it was a little touch and go.

Honey, not now.

<i>When Jackson and I
first started dating,</i>

<i>he would go down on me.</i>

<i>Afterwards,
he'd always get a cold.</i>

l freaked out.

l thought, ''Oh, my God,
Jackson is allergic

<i>to pussy. ''</i>

Um,

<i>can I get you some wine?</i>

l don't drink,

<i>unfortunately.</i>

Oh, here.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Bumpity bumpity bumpity bump.

Oh, my God.

How can you stand
to work with her?

Nine to five,
uh-uh.

Excuse me?

But l am glad
she set us up,

because you are cute.

l'll be right back.

<i>[muttering]
Ooh, I gotta go.</i>


<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>Ahh.</i>

<i>[toilet flushes]</i>

<i>? La-la,
la-la-la-la-la. ?</i>

<i>? La-la, la-la-la,
la-la-la-la. ?</i>

<i>? La-la, la-la-la,
la-la-la-la. ?</i>

<i>What do you think?</i>

<i>Some people think
I sound like Mandy Patinkin.</i>

<i>I kind of think
it's more like Liza.</i>

<i>You know,
like a male version?</i>

<i>What do you think, huh?</i>

<i>[deep voice]
Hi.</i>

Mount me.

[whispers loudly]
l got poppers.

[thunder booming]

[doorbell rings]

Can we go get some coffee?

What?

Thank you.

You look great.

<i>Steven,
l have to apologize.</i>

For what?

This, having coffee.

You know l'm 40 years old,

a young 40.

That's why
you should meet my dad.

He's gay.

Him and my mom
recently divorced.

l mean, l wasn't sure
if you were gay,

but l knew
you were different.

You didn't think
that l was-

Oh, shit; l'm sorry.
l didn't-

No, no, not at all.

Your father, me,
the same age, common ground.

We probably both owned
a pet rock in '7 3.

l'm sorry.
l-l didn't-

Listen, l-l should call it a night.

My baby.

Hi, Mom.

Hello, son.

Did you hit any elk
along the way?

They escaped from the park.
They're goddamn everywhere.

Hey, Dad.

What's with the sunglasses?

Cataract surgery.

Can't take 'em off

till that little shit Bill Dempson
tells me l can.

Can't see his hand
in front of his face.

That's not true.

That's Louise, dear.

l'm downwind.

Oh, come here
and give me a big hug.

Oh, hey, Mrs. Baker,

<i>Mr. Baker.</i>

Listen to him.

Been best friends with your parents
since before you were born.

Still he says, ''Mrs. Baker.''

<i>(Doris)
Louise, hello.</i>


Well, it's, uh,
good to be home.

<i>(Bob)
Scotch straight up,
right, Charlie?</i>

Please.

<i>(Doris)
Bob, come outside.</i>

l'm making a drink.

<i>Nowl</i>

Happy 45th.

Well, look at that.

<i>How's she run, Terry?</i>

<i>Like a charm, Mr. Jenkins.</i>

<i>Good.
Let's go back to the bar.</i>

<i>Don't you want
to drive it?</i>

After a few drinks.

<i>(man)
Brad?</i>

Bill Dempson.

l'll be damned.

<i>How long has it been?</i>

Honey, this is Brad.

<i>We were best friends
in high school.</i>

l'm loaded.

Hon,

<i>go grab a seat
and cross your legs.</i>

<i>Your dad comes
to see me.</i>

Who would have ever thought
Bill Dempson

<i>would become a doctor?</i>

So are you,
but l'm a real one,

<i>an MD.</i>

<i>[chuckles]</i>

Hello, gentlemen.

Julie, you look great.

Having fun yet?

Working on it.

You two did everything
in school together,

<i>and she ends up
marrying your brother.</i>

How did that happen?

Me and you
stopped talking.

You stopped talking to me.

Well, what happened?

Well, l told you
l was a fag.

Oh, yeah.

[knocks softly]

What?

Where's Farrah?

l bought that hoping

<i>it would make me straight.</i>

Your nephews.

You are correct, sir.

l'll put them in your wallet.

Hey.

Look at this.

<i>Dwayne Twillis.</i>

<i>He was out in high school.</i>

<i>He died of AIDS in the '80s.</i>

l never even told him
l was gay.

Oh, look,
Yolanda Smith.

<i>(Brad)
Roland Davis,</i>

<i>the most handsome,
the most athletic.</i>

Mm, l was always
in love with him.

He never even knew
l existed.

<i>Secret:</i>

l always wanted
Roland Davis

to have taken me
to our Blue Jean Ball.

Blue Jean Ball,
what a rip.

Every other high school
had a prom,

and we had
a Blue Jean Ball.

How embarrassing.

And Keith, home from college,
had to pick you up

because you were too drunk
to drive home.

And he died a year later.

Now, he was the brother
you should have married.

He was the special one.

The day l transferred
to Lincoln,

met you when
l dropped my books,

<i>l knew you
were someone special.</i>

Aww.

Have you been drinking?

Tsk.

Goddamn it, Brad.

You promised.

<i>You always bail
on your promises.</i>

Shit, relax.

What the hell
is wrong with you?

l just turned 40;

l'm gay;
l'm still single.

<i>You do the math.</i>

<i>Oh, Christ, when will you wake up
and realize some straight-guy Republican</i>

<i>who voted for both Bushes</i>

<i>is never gonna
fall in love with you?</i>

When the day comes

<i>and you're attracted
to someone</i>

and you let them know it,

not knowing whether they're gonna
smile or kick your ass,

<i>then we can spar.</i>

What do you know
about my attractions?

What do you know
about my being gay,

living in a world where no one

<i>pays attention to you?</i>

<i>Julie, women bitch
about construction workers</i>

yelling at them.

Jesus, do you know how nice it would be
if just some hard hat would tell me

<i>what a nice ass I had,</i>

<i>which is pretty fucking nice,
I might add?</i>

So l can't fix a car,

but l sure as hell
don't have to dress up

<i>like Judy Garland either.</i>

You lost me
at Judy Garland

<i>fixing a car.</i>

Julie,

<i>I'm always
gonna be different.</i>

l just wish
that l was normal.

Normal? Fine.

You can have my normal life.

<i>You can have my normal job,
my normal husband,</i>

who's having
a perfectly normal affair

with his normal
fucking secretary.

[door slams]

<i>(Bob)
Oh, that's-</i>

Wait a minute;
is it my turn?

l got it;
l got it right here.

<i>(Louise)
Oh, you better not be.</i>

[Bakers laughing]

What?

Show him;
show him.


Shit.

Need some help?

No, no, l was just
helping clean up.

That's what l'm for.

l saw Mrs. Longworth
at the party.

She says Theresa's
doing wonderful.

She's in town.

You should go out.

Mom, l'm gay.

How many times do we have
to have this conversation?

All right, all right.

No, no,
it's not all right.

<i>Do l have to give you a pop quiz
every time l come home?</i>

We will not create a scene
with company in the house.

<i>We are middle-class
white people.</i>

Well.

<i>Well, don't worry, Mom.
I'm not gonna bring home any son-in-law.</i>

All the real cowboys are gone;
haven't you heard?

What are you talking about?

l'm talking-

l'm saying,

<i>you and Dad
raised a great family.</i>

No dysfunction here.

<i>You raised
three great boys.</i>

<i>Hey, one of them was taken
away from you too soon,</i>

but everybody said
Keith and l were just alike.

Keith wasn't that different.

l'm sorry;
l didn't mean that.

Hey, no offense taken.

Where are you going?

<i>Someplace where I'm not
so goddamn different.</i>

Bob, this dishwasher sucks!

[tires squealing]

Okay, boys.

Line forms to the right.

l need a man
who looks fabulous!


[tires squealing]

[loud crash]

[crickets chirping]

Oh, crap.
l got a limp wrist.

<i>Just what I need-
some Blair Witch shit.</i>

[people talking indistinctly]

Well, once you
put that word down,

you completely
messed me up.

That's all l know.

<i>(Louise)
What happened-what?</i>

<i>Nobody cared.</i>

<i>It made me sad.</i>

[voices fade]


Oh, no, no, now,
you all pay attention.

Watch this one;
l think l got it.

<i>(Doris)
Let's see.</i>

<i>What you got?
What you got?</i>

<i>There, see,
I told you I got it.</i>

<i>(Doris)
''Straight. ''</i>


<i>You better not be.</i>


<i>(Halbert)
That was a good one.</i>

<i>Good stuff.</i>

<i>[alarm buzzing]</i>



<i>Moml</i>

Mom.

Mom!

Morning, dear.

Mom, you're so young.

You're sweet.

You better get dressed,
or you'll be late for school.

School?

That's right;
it's time to go to school.

Louise!

Ah, listen to him,
''Louise.''

Mother Baker, hello?

l'll be in meetings all day,

but l shouldn't
be late for supper.

l hope not.

Oh, you're such a hoper.


<i>[Bob knocking]
Morning.</i>

Oh, look, there's your dad
and Daddy Baker.

Now, what would they want
so early in the morning?

Looks like we have
something outside.

Happy senior year.


l wrecked my car.

Wrecked your car?

Well, that's impossible;
you just got it.

<i>(Louise)
And here it is,</i>

just like you always wanted.

<i>(Halbert)
Look at him.</i>

He's so happy,
he can't even talk.

Let's take that boy in
for some cake.

Cake this early?

Hey, why not?

<i>(man)
Hey, step out of that car.
Let me see your ass.</i>

screech!

Holy shit.

[people talking indistinctly]

What are you doing?

Bill?

<i>Bill, guys are with guys.</i>

Girls are with girls.

So?

We're old enough to date.

Yeah, but they're with each other
like they're couples.

Boy, did your parents
bail on you.

Leave it to me
to fill in the blanks.

Guys like guys;
girls like girls.

Get it?

How do we produce?

You're serious,
aren't you?

Your parental partner.

Parental partner?

The woman you decide
to have children with,

your female best friend.

Parental partner, right.

Are we together?

We're practically brothers.

That would be like incest
or something, yuck.

Holy shit.

<i>Brad.</i>

Brad.

Are you all right?

Yeah, l think so.

Thank you.

Brad,

Brad Jenkins.

Am l?

Hi, Roland.

You look
really nice today.

Holy shit.

<i>(coach)
People, people, people,</i>

come on, come on.

Find your opposite partner

<i>and take your showers.</i>

<i>You got five minutes
till the next bell.</i>

Roland Davis thought
you looked nice today.

Wow.

What's the matter?

Jenkins!

<i>Get your ass</i>

into shower seven.

And quit flirtin'.

<i>[woman singing indistinctly]</i>

<i>? ?</i>

Yolanda Smith.

Brad Jenkins?

<i>thudl
Oohl</i>

Are you okay?

Brad Jenkins.

Yes.

You're home.

Yes.

Why?

l live here?

lt's Thursday night.

You're supposed to be

<i>at your father's
and Daddy Baker's tonight.</i>

Now, hop over there
before dinner starts.

<i>Your father thinks
I mother you enough</i>

as it is.

<i>(Louise)
Ooh, that chicken
looks good,</i>

<i>and so do these thighs.</i>

<i>slapl</i>

<i>[Doris laughing]
Stop, I'm cooking.</i>

Son, what's wrong?

Where's my room?

Upstairs.

<i>(Halbert)
Well, you are going to eat it
and like it.</i>

l don't want to hear any complaints.
l've had a long day.

l'm not going to eat
and like iceberg lettuce.

lt's romaine lettuce,
by the way.

And you could have used
real cheese.

l don't want to even hear it;
now, look-

This cheese has never
seen the inside of a cow.

Well, why don't you just

<i>wash it down
with a nice can of Billy Beer?</i>

Could feed it
to the dog.

What's wrong?

My room is exactly the same way
as it is across the street.

That's how
you wanted it.

Did something
happen at school?

Sam?

<i>Sam?
Sam.</i>

Oh, Sam.

lt's okay, Brad.
lt's just Sam.

l haven't seen him
since we had him put to sleep.

Sam hasn't been put to sleep;
he's fine.

He's just waiting for you to come home
from school like always.

What's happening
to me, Sam?

What the fuck
is going on?

[knock at door]

<i>(Bob)
Can I come in?</i>

l'm getting old.

l spoke
with your mother tonight.

<i>She thinks something
might be wrong.</i>

l think l know what it is-

upset about Sam,
other things.

<i>You're growing up.</i>

Soon you're gonna
meet somebody.

You'll settle down with him.

<i>You'll have children with someone
as wonderful as your mother.</i>

You'll all have
wonderful children and be happy.

Dad, this is so odd.

Well, it might
sound silly to you.

l'm sure you know
all this stuff already,

<i>but it's important
that you hear it from me.</i>

Dad.

Yes, son?

<i>I like guys.</i>

l've always wanted

<i>to tell you that.</i>

Chip off the old block.

You wrecked your car?

Not that car,
my other car.

You don't have
another car.

What were you doing
at Overlook Ridge?

That's where straight people

<i>go and. . .you know.</i>

l can't tell you that.

You wouldn't believe me.

<i>I don't believe me.</i>

Let's just go to Overlook Ridge,
and l'll show you the car.

Why me?

Because you've always

<i>helped my family.</i>

And because
you own a tow truck.

Come on, Brad.

l know it was here.

lt's somewhere around here.

You got to believe me.

lt's the city.

They probably, uh, brought
the car back to the city lot.

But l'm not gonna do anything
until you tell me what this is all about.

Come on, Brad.

You don't need
to lie like this.

Are you a bed wetter?

l didn't wet my car.

l wrecked my car.

Listen, l don't have time

to be taken away from work
for some kind of practical joke.

You're a good kid.

You don't need
to do this for attention.

That's just it.
l'm not a kid.

l'm 40 years old,
a young 40.

Look at me;
don't l act it?

l pay bills now.

l get great
retirement benefits.

l took
a real aggressive package.

l could have early retirement
at 55 if l wanted to.

Listen, l'm taking you back.

Let's go.

<i>l know it sounds crazy,
Terry, but l'm not.</i>

You gotta believe me, Terry.
You just gotta.

This is it.

This is my car.

<i>It's junk.</i>

Yeah, but they didn't make cars
like these back in the '7 0s.

Could be a demo.

[techno music plays]
Terry,

<i>now do you believe me?</i>

<i>? ?</i>

l can't believe anybody
would listen to that shit.

What if they listened to it
on this?

Where's the needle?

They're digital.

lt's read by binary code,
bitmaps, something like that.

Jesus.

l hate to sound
like Michael J. Fox,

but l'm from the future.

lt's not me, Terry.

lt's me.

Who's Michael J. Fox?

[hydraulics whirring]

lf you can get it running,
l think l can get back home.

lt doesn't make any sense,

but it makes no sense
me being here in the first place.

So let me get this straight.

ln your world,
men like being with women?

That's what they say,
until they drink a six-pack.

So if l fix it, then what?

We'll take it back to Overlook Ridge
and see if it works.

lf it doesn't,
l'll just wait another 20 years

to get back on the internet.

But if your world
is the way you say it is,

why would you want
to go back?

lt's where l belong.

(Mr. Thompson)
The French Revolution
began in 1 7 99.

lt changed the course
of the country's history,

<i>which still affects it today.</i>

<i>Danton and Robespierre
dominated the new government,</i>

<i>Robespierre gradually
gaining over Danton-</i>

Um.

Yes, Brad.

l think
you're confusing the dates.

You think so?

Actually, l know so.

You're confusing it
with the fall of Robespierre.

<i>The Revolution itself
began in 1 7 93.</i>

<i>At least,
that was the beginning</i>

of the flight of the emigres

and the resurrection
of the lampposts.

You know, Mr. Jenkins,

l haven't always been
just a high school teacher.

l was a professor
before l came here,

and do you know where?

<i>Gilligan's Island?</i>

You have an attitude problem,
young man.

Now, l'm going to have
to call your parents.

You know that, don't you?

Yes, sir.

Good, then.

That's what l want to hear.

<i>Now, what you need
is some more school spirit</i>

and some more class involvement.

<i>I noticed you didn't sign up
to take anybody to the Blue Jean Ball.</i>

Now, l am sure there is some young man
just waiting to ask you,

<i>or you ask him.</i>

<i>Roland,
how's our all-American, huh?</i>

Hi.

Hi, Roland.

<i>(Fock)
Now, about
that basketball scholarship.</i>

<i>I think you should consider
all three. . .</i>

Brad, can you show our
new transfer student to room 24?

<i>This is-
Juliel</i>

You know my name.

You are correct, sir.

So what's this school like?

Oh, a waste of time.

God, l can't get over
how young you look.

l am a senior.

So what are the girls like?

l don't know.

l guess not;
you're a guy.

Oh, here it is,
room 422.

So-
Thanks for the tour.

You should have
seen the look

on Mr. Thompson's face
when you took him down.

Yeah, real mature
on my part.

Hi, Brad.

Hi, Roland.

Hope you didn't
get in trouble

with Mr. Fock.

Nah, great guy.

[all laugh]

See ya.

Look at you.

You've got the best-looking guy
talking to you,

and you're smart.

<i>Fuck you, breeder.</i>

That's Dwayne Twillis.

Fucking hole puncher.

What?

You know, a breeder,
straight.

He likes girls so much,
he even acts like one.

God, it makes me sick.

This Janis lan album
is the coolest.

That is so straight.

<i>(Brad)
You dropped your milk.</i>

<i>Listen, I just-</i>

Busted.

<i>(Bob)
Brad, is that you?</i>

You're home.

l'm at Mom's tonight?

l'm going right now.

No, you've got company.

Roland came by
to see you.

Roland's been telling us
about his plans

<i>to play for the NB A.</i>

l was just wondering

if you'd like to go out with me
for some ice cream.

Go on.

We're at your Mom's tonight-
every goddamned night-

playing Scrabble.

Okay.

Can l change
real quick?

Sure.

<i>(Brad)
He was all alone.</i>

<i>He was just sitting
at the end of the bar.</i>

<i>God, I was so nervous
being in that place.</i>

Something made me go up
and talk to him.

l just went up and asked
if l could sit at his table.

He stood up
just like the perfect gentleman.

He was 34.

34?

Yeah, divorced
with two kids.

<i>Jeez.</i>

Well, we decided to try it.

l don't know;

l thought it was my last chance
to finally have a family.

lt didn't end very well.

lt was too much for him.
lt was too much for me.

The moral of the story is,

don't get in a one-night stand
that ends up lasting two years.

l like you.

You're different
than all the other guys.

<i>[whistle]</i>

<i>(Terry)
It runs.</i>

<i>Overlook Ridge,
tomorrow night.</i>

Excuse me.

[bell clanging]

l don't want
to do it.

Why?

l don't know;
l just don't want to do it.

What about
your life?

Where you belong?

Your retirement benefits?

l'm having fun here.

Why do you want
to take that away from me?

lt wasn't my decision.

Shit.

Shit, all right.

Okay.

<i>1 1 :00 tomorrow night.</i>

Don't tell your parents.

Yeah.

[engine turns]

What's happening
at Overlook Ridge?

Nothing.

Uh, we're test-driving a car.

Guess you like older guys.

No.

Oh, God, no.

You don't know.

<i>You asking me out
for ice cream</i>

is something
l've always dreamed.

lt happened
exactly how l'd hoped.

But it just
can't happen again.

lt's just not in the cards.

Why?

Because you wouldn't like
older guys.

<i>(Bob)
Had a friend
who went to Jordan, and they-</i>

<i>(Halbert)
How would you spell ''fezzes''?</i>

<i>(Louise)
Uh, I think it's double Zs.</i>

What you getting, hon?

l came to say good-bye.

Going back out?

You and Roland

<i>have a good time.</i>

<i>I'm real proud of you.</i>

<i>Is it-
what's the blank?</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>(Louise)
Lover.</i>

You be a good boy.

<i>(Bob)
Liver?</i>

<i>(Halbert)
You just messed up my word.</i>

<i>Now I don't have
a word to use.</i>

Ooh, sweetie.

l, uh, wanted to tell you all
l think what you got going here

<i>really works.</i>

l love you all
very much.

We love you too, hon.

<i>(Bob)
How do you spell ''fezzes''?</i>

<i>(Louise)
Uh, two Zs.</i>

<i>(Doris)
Double Z.</i>

<i>(Bob)
With two Zs.</i>

<i>(Louise)
It's Arabic anyway.</i>

[hydraulics whirring]

l say l got about a half-mile stretch
down the road is where it happened.

What do you plan to do?

lt worked for Michael J. Fox.
lt can work for me.

Who's this guy
from the South?

[engine turns]

<i>Ramming speed.</i>

You're going
to crash this car?

<i>Are you crazy?</i>

Right where
l crashed it before.

l have to.

Don't do this.

l don't have a choice.

<i>I don't belong here.</i>

l got to get home
and grade papers.

[engine revving]

Don't always
work so hard, Terry.

Have some fun sometimes.

[engine revving]

l'm not gonna let you do this.

Being around all straight people
has really fucked you up.

What are you doing?

l'm putting
this damn thing in neutral.

<i>That's not neutrall</i>

lt's first gear!

[Terry screams]

[tires squealing]

[loud crash]


What's up?

<i>Are you crazy?
You could have gotten yourself killed.</i>

What are you doing here?

l followed you.

Why?

Because-

because l like older guys.

Oh, what the fuck
am l doing?

l'm never leaving this place,

ever.

[upbeat music]

? Oh, yeah. ?

This is great.

? For every day of my life
filled with hurt and pain, ?

? l would trade for one night
in the pouring rain with you. ?

? ?

? l was falling apart,
coming out at the seams, ?

? but l know in my heart
this isn't a dream. ?

? lt's true. ?

? This is the day. ?

? Now is the time. ?

? l've waited for you
all of my life. ?

? Now it's all clear. ?

? l found my way ?

? into your arms
and out of the gray. ?

? This is the day. ?

? ?

? Oh, yeah. ?

? ?

? For the rest of my life,
l'll say good-bye to my fears, ?

? bury the past,
and cherish the years with you. ?

? Oh, this is the day. ?

? Now is the time. ?

? l've waited for you
all of my life. ?

[clears throat]

? Now it's all clear. ?

Woof.

<i>(woman)
Okay, thanks for coming, guys.</i>

<i>Basically, what we're

<i>learning another cheer.</i>

You can't be serious.

Good luck.

Wait a minute.

<i>I'm not lighting

Listen, Marine,

We start with two claps
like this.

V-l-C-T-O-R-Y.

Victory, victory, is our cry.

<i>that sounded great.</i>

Okay?

[fireworks exploding]
[girls screaming]

Ooh, shit.

Oh.

My congratulations

<i>(Roland)
Hey.</i>

You should check out

Shit, Roland.

[people talking and laughing]

So did you

Yeah,

no thanks to you.

So how come

l don't know.

Afraid they'll turn out
like me.

What's wrong with you?

Can't fix a car.

Well, l'm gonna have kids,

<i>What if they're boys?</i>

Uh-uh, l'm gonna have girls.

Girls, right.

Brad.

<i>Listen, I want to apologize

Did you hear me?

<i>I said I'm sorry.</i>

Could you turn around, please?

What?

Could you turn around, please?

No problem.

We are the mighty Lincoln team.

We're gonna rock you

[rhythmic clapping]

The game's over.

Why are you still here?

God, if only l could date a jock.


Good job;
that was really great.

Um, l'll see you tomorrow, okay?

Good job.


God, l need a joint.

Good plan.

Afterwards,
you want to have sex?

Hell, yeah.

So when you dropped your books
the first day that we met,

what did you mean
by l was special?

Have you always
been in love with me?

ls that why
you married my brother,

the next best thing?

Come on, come on, come on.

Let's get going here, people.

Come on, come on, come on.

l got your note.

What are you doing?

Somebody could see us.

So what?

Nobody cares.

<i>Only straight people
come here.</i>

No.

You were terrific.

Let's do it again.

No.

We can't.

lt's not right.

l was just experimenting.

l'm not an experiment.

l want to be your boyfriend.

You're nuts.

That's great.

That's my new nickname,
Planters.

So what do we do?

Where do we go?

Hide and sneak
every time we want to meet?

We can't go anywhere
or do anything

without somebody seeing us.

How's it going?

Fine.

What's up?

Nothing.

Nice day.

What do you want?

Nothing, man.

We just wanted
to go somewhere.

You know, like a bar.

We thought you might
know some places.

l-l don't know
what you're talking about.

l think you do.

[funky instrumental music]

? ?

Two Cokes, please.

What?

l got to work
early in the morning.

This is a trip.

Come on, let's dance.

Jesus.


<i>(man)
Fucking breeders.</i>

<i>(man)
Hole-punching prick.</i>

Get off him!

[Dwayne coughing]

Oh, shit.

Shit, come on.

l got you.

Come on.

We got to get him
back inside.

l got ya.
Come on, buddy.

Here, put your arm up.

Breeder.

ls it true?

lt's not that simple.

You promised me.

<i>Getting married,
Wildcat Hills.</i>

How could you
embarrass me like this?

l have a game
tomorrow night.

Oh, what the fuck else
can go wrong?

l feel like a freak.

Julie-

Leave me alone.

Haven't you done enough?


Something wrong?

l talked to Roland's mother
this morning.

<i>She told me some
pretty disturbing things.</i>

Really?
Like what?

l can't get this stain out.

<i>I don't know why
you always make such a mess.</i>

<i>Her name is Julie.</i>

l don't want to know

<i>anything about her.</i>

Her name is Julie,
and l love her.

<i>That's disgustingl</i>

<i>How can you say that?</i>

How can you
even think that?

There's nothing for me

<i>to be ashamed of.</i>

<i>It's wrong.</i>

<i>That's crazy.</i>

Tell that to the neighbors.

<i>Tell that to your father.</i>

Oh, yeah,

<i>the guy who you
had sex with to have me.</i>

<i>It's not the same.</i>

lt's love,
but not like that.

<i>I could never
be with someone</i>

of the opposite sex
in that way.

Good for you,
but l can.

lt's a sin.

Then l go to hell,
but guess what.

<i>You don't.</i>

Mom.

Mom, look at me.

Look at me.

Mama, l'm alone.

l got stuck with this life
l didn't want.

l don't know whether l chose it
or it chose me.

You're just 1 8 years old.

What are you
talking about?

l'm back, Mom.

l've come back
trying to make things right.

lf God had wanted man
and a woman to be together,

he would have made women
like football.

Pretty good.

<i>So what's next?</i>

You graduate
in a couple of weeks.

What are you gonna do?

l don't know.
Head for California.

<i>Start Microsoft.</i>

Hmm, come on.

What's your big wish?

<i>What's the number one thing
you've always wanted to do,</i>

which is a secret?

Secret?

What?

Nah, forget it.

Hey, well,
congratulations.

You fixed a car.

By the way,
found this in your backseat.

You know, maybe it's not
such a good idea

to play Captain Kirk
at your age.

[tap at window]


What are you doing?

l've come
to ask you something.

You can't climb up my house
and come in my room.

Julie, will you go
to the ball with me?

l can't.

You're a boy.

You can do anything
you want to do.

No, l don't want
to be like this.

l feel so different.

There's something
wrong with me.

Julie, hey.

The minute you accept
that you're different

is the moment
you become normal.

Julie.

Here.

Oh, they're beautiful.

They're the most beautiful boys
l've ever seen.

<i>They're your children, Julie.</i>


l've never met anyone
with more love or more understanding

<i>to give than you.</i>

What are you?

Just a normal guy.

Where the hell
are you two going?

To the ball.

And if you don't
get out of our way,

l'm gonna fuck you up.

You were my friend.

Now you make me sick.

Then take some Pepto-Bismol.

<i>(Thompson)
Is there a problem here?</i>

They want to come
to the ball

as a couple.

Well, then get out
of their way

<i>and let them come in.</i>

You can't do that.

l'm the teacher.

<i>I can do
whatever the hell I want.</i>

Thanks, Professor.

[jangly rock music]

? ?

You better remember this.

What, the Blue Jean Ball?

No, coming here
with me.

l am so nervous.

You're nervous?

May l have this dance?

l get to lead.

Not on my clock.

We'll have
none of that.

What are you doing?

[music stops abruptly]

Now, we can't
keep your kind out,

but l can certainly keep you
from doing something as disgusting

<i>as what you're doing.</i>

What are we doing?

What you're doing

<i>is vulgar.</i>

And if you think we're gonna sit around

and be forced to watch
such a disgusting spectacle,

<i>well, you can just
think again.</i>

No, he can't
make us stop.

Yes, he can.

But it doesn't matter.

There's a nice tree outside
we can dance under.

Come on.

No, l want to dance
at my ball.

Julie.

We can spar later.

<i>(Fock)
You better listen to him,
young lady.</i>

<i>You're not welcome.</i>

None of us here wants
you or your kind around.

[jangly rock music]

? ?

Would you like
to have this dance with me?

Hell, yeah.

Roland.

Roland, what are you-

Roland.

Roland, you stop this
this instant.

Roland, you are
an all-American.

l've been waiting 20 years
to ask you this.

May l have this dance?

Oh, l beg your pardon.

Nancy.

[whispers loudly]
Stop it.

Eww!

l've got something
to show you.

There it is.

<i>Brought it here
just like you told me to.</i>

What is it?

lt's a magic carpet.

lt can take us
anywhere we want to go.


<i>[Julie screams]</i>

<i>Helpl
Helpl</i>

You freak.

Somebody help me!

<i>(Bill)
Fucking breeder.</i>

<i>(Julie)
hurry upl</i>

<i>(Bill)
Hole puncher.</i>

You fucking freak.


You're never gonna
hurt me again.

l'm gonna fucking
kill you.

Bill,

<i>shut up.</i>

Nobody's even
listening to you.

l'm straight.

l like women.

There's nothing
you can say or do

that's ever
gonna change that.

And there's nothing
l would do

<i>to ever change that.</i>

Brad?

What's wrong?

lt's my brother Keith.

l've come to take you home, sport.

Oh.

<i>I wanted you
as a friend</i>

and got you as a girlfriend.

l wanted you as a boyfriend. . .

then got you as a friend.

<i>Seems I spent my whole life
always wanting.</i>

And what l want

<i>isn't necessarily
what I need.</i>

l need to go home.

Shotgun.

[engine turns]

Can somebody
take me home?

<i>[buzzing]</i>

l'll have a Nutter Butter
peanut butter sandwich cookie.

l'll get the doctor.

[loud thud]

Oh, shit.

lt's okay, Brad.

You're gonna be fine.

You're going
to be okay, dear.

l love you
so much.

l love you too, Mom.

<i>[woman over P.A. system]
Martha, you have a call on 4-9-5-3-5.</i>

All right, sit.

<i>Sleep;
no more Wizard of Oz dreams.</i>

Mine make Dorothy's
look like the Golf Channel.

<i>Well, there's no place
like home.</i>

l got to go.

So soon?

Well, once l get
the kids settled at Mom's

and talk with your brother,
l'll be back.

What's gonna happen?

l don't know.

He'll have to make a decision,
l'll have to make a decision,

and we'll take it from there.

Tell him you're a lesbian.
That always turns him on.


Tell me again how great
sex with me in the shower was.

Like being with 'NS YNC,
the Backstreet Boys,

<i>and Ricky Martin
all rolled into one.</i>

<i>Thank you for taking me
to my Blue Jean Ball.</i>

l got to go.

<i>[man on television]
And welcome back to Hard News

<i>Tonight: Homosexuals-

director of Queers in Your Face,</i>

<i>based out of San Francisco,
California.</i>

<i>Reverend, as we were</i>

<i>what kind, if any?</i>

<i>(Dent)
These people are sick</i>

and should be without rights.

We need to blow 'em up!

What's next,
the final solution?

Nuke 'em all?

There's nothing you're gonna

so kiss my faggot ass.

<i>(Dent)
God will not honor this method.</i>

[both arguing]

<i>(Lane)
Gentlemen, gentlemen,</i>

<i>we're going to have to ask you

<i>Gentlemen.</i>

<i>Gentlemen-Reverend.</i>

Multiply and replenish the earth.

Reverend,
we're going to have to-

Reverend, we're going
to have to ask you to be quiet,

or we're going
to have to cut you off.

That is not
the way of God.

<i>(Lane)
Reverend, we're going to have to-</i>

Oh, shut up, you frickin' breeder.

We'll be right back
