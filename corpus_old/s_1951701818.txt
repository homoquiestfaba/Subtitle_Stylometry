one of the richest communities
in America

Guyworks so fuckin' hard
to get a house like this

Big fuckin' house

in a split-level ranch

So, you let me in...

No, no

You wait outside,

I'll case the joint,
see what's portable,

meet you later

Well, what am I supposed to do?

Emma, everything with you
has to go back to sex

Well

I wanted to feel
close to someone

A month?

Two months?

Emma

Look, I'm not rationalizing this

It's cheating,
and I feel awful about it

I do

Oh, my God, have I
become that desperate?

Six months?

Maybe more
Oh, my God

And I'm sure it hasn't been
that long for Jerry, though

No, I'm sure it hasn't

So, tell me

When, how, where?

Welll told him

That I would
leave the light on for him

The light?
You know

that Jerry's away and

And he can come in

anywhere in the world,

where would it be?

I took those right out of her fuckin' ears

Mmm

Look what the cat dragged in

Where's your partner?

He's, uh

He's not here

I can see

I thought you were a team

We are

Maybe someone needs
to start looking for a new partner

I think someone needs
to mind their own fucking business

What do you have for me?

Now I'm happy

Very happy

I'll be happy too once I get paid

I'm thinking9,000 for all of it

Ten

Okay

Nine it is

Thank you, very much

You're welcome

Oh, hell yeah!

So

What are we doing?

Takin' a walk

Yeah?

Andwhat about my mom?

Yeah, uh

You gonna tell her?

Tell her what?
I mean there's nothing to tell

<i>What are you gonna tell her?</i>

Nothing for me to tell anymore either

Oh

So

What do you do?

I uh

I steal stuff

And that's it?
Yeah

That and get busted for it

Pretty cool, huh?

Oh, yeah

I stole something once

Got busted for it

ll've been here before

I knowthat bridge

Yeah, it's pretty old

I think itwas built in, like, 1911
by an architect from, uh, Prague

Yeah, I saw a picture once
from when theywere just building it,

you know, and

everything around it looked so

justwild anduntouched

ltwas kind of haunting, really

Nothing looks like that anymore,
you know

It's all developed

Not everywhere

Yeah, I guess

So where'd you grow up?

All over the place

Hmm

I've never been there

You should go

Yeah

Maybe I'll stop by

<i>No!</i>

<i>Up there...</i>

Got a little surprise for you

Ready?

He's cute

Taylor

This is Candice

Hmm All right

I doubt that's her real name

Huh, bro?

Just like old times

That's the Jacuzzi I told you about

Hot!

What do you say, dog?

So

Taylor?

What's up, bro?

We gonna party?

Shut the fuck up

You knowwhat?
Here

Take this fucking money

Pssh!

Yeah, you guys have fun together

Go! Fucking

Dude, what's wrong with you?

Yeah, you'd rather
watch fucking cartoons, dude?

This fucking

moody shit's getting a little old

That cunt's clouding your judgment

How's it going, man?

Hey

Nice barn

What are you doing here?

What are you doing here?

I'm workin'

Working?

Workin' on what?

Your golf swing?

No, I, uh

met Karen's daughter

She's got some rich friends

I thoughtwe could hit them,
too, you know?

I like the way you think

Regular entrepreneur

Taylor?

Ashley But I'm sure my esteemed
colleague has told you all about me

He's told me all about you

Well, I better run

You two lovebirds have a swell time

Been a pleasure meeting you, April

You certainly are
a lovely young woman

Who was that?

Just an old friend

Nobody

Yeah

Wow

This is cool

Yeah
It's my favorite spot

What's so funny?

Nothing

So, uh

What do we do now?

I haven't really
thought that far ahead

Which is funny,
'cause usually that's all I do

Think ahead

I try not to think at all

Well, look where it got me

In the barn,
with my mother's "lovah"

I guess I'm just starting to feel

Stuck, you know?

Why? This

This is great

Look around you

I mean, seriously,
look at everyone

They're slaving away
for houses, cars, stock options

They're completely
dying inside, and for what?

In 30, 40 years,
what's the sun gonna set on?

This

It's... it's like a mundane lockdown

You're startin' to sound like my friend

I don't think I'm
too keen on your friend

Yeah

I don't blame you
I don't really like him sometimes, either

So why you with him?

He's all I got

That's sad

You're sad

So what happened to you?

What happened to me

Let's see

Well, I never knew my dad

Didn't really know my mom

She was a hippie

They fucked, they had me,
and they never gave a shit about me

And she dropped me on my head
when I was six months old

I know, fuckin' ridiculous

I got a dent, right here

It's flat Feel it

And I'm a thief
And I fuck people over

How's thatworkin' out for ya?

Pretty good, I guess

Yeah?

Brought you here?

For what?

Just tryin' to get by

When can I see you again?

I'm sure you'll find me

I don't think she liked me

No, I don't think
she liked you, either

You're gonna fuckin'
blowthis for us, man

What are you...
what are you talkin' about?

Fuckin' show in there

Big fuckin' deal
We gotta get outta here anyway, man

People are gettin' suspicious

This town is fuckin' bullshit

Just drive

Calm down, pal

Let's go up to Westchester County

There's fuckin' rich people
out the ass up there

Or Miami

Whatever, man
Just, can we go?

Jesus Christ

<i>So what's
the deal with Ashley?</i>

He's my best friend We

We grew up together
Went into foster care

People we knew
from the neighborhood

Whatwas that like?

Let's see, eight kids
in a one-bedroom apartment

fighting over scraps

I mean, we lived off
of leftover Greek food

from this diner they owned

That's extraordinarily fucked up

Yeah, that's, uh
that's not the half of it

What's the other half?

Ashley's dad gave him this
German shepherd when he was alive

After his dad died, they let us
keep the dog at the foster home

That dog was so cool
and so smart

He sensed that our new
ma and pop, Frank and Sally,

you know, they
weren't stand-up people

So, after years of the dog

hating them, growling at 'em,
and trying to bite them,

they said enough was enough

So one night at dinner,
good old Frank says, "Hey, Ashley!

What do you think of the stew?"

Ashley said,
"For a chef, it tastes like shit"

Frank said, "Well, it should,
'cause it's dog meat"

Then he threw
the dog collar at Ashley

We beat his ass that night

Put him in the hospital for a month

Ashley crippled his hands

He used the door as a vise

He wanted it to be a constant reminder

Every time he looked at those hands
he would remember what he did

Don't do that

Do what?

Pity him He... he hates it

I wasn't

So, where in NewYork did you live?

Brooklyn

I always wanted to live there

I've always wanted
to move back

You wanna go?

Yeah, okay

Yeah?

J-j, yeah, j-just like that

Yeah, just like that

O-o-okay

Well, uh, give me
a couple days to sort some shit out

You'd better make it fast
I might change my mind

I will

I wanna bring her with us

Who, Pollyanna?

April

You gotta be fuckin' kidding...
Quit fuckin' around

You can't be fuckin' serious

Oh, I'm serious

Oh, I get it

She read about guys like us

in her little beat-poetry
feministworkshop

Huh? The tortured rebel
with the heart of gold?

You done?

How's she gonna react
when she finds outwhat you really do?

What you're really like?

That you steal fuckin' cars,

you rob houses, you do drugs...

She knowss

Really?
Yeah

She doesn't give a shit?

No, she doesn't

Fuck

A bad little rich girl

Shit, fuck it, man

She can come with us

What are you doing?

Just

you know, thinking

Go on

You can say it...
I deserve it

Deserve what?

You were right

You're always right

How did you
get to be so smart, huh?

I'm so sorry, April

It's all right

You got it out of your system

Mm, no

No, for all of it

For everything

I miss Dad

I miss him, too

God, I miss him so much

I tried, you know

ltjust all went by so fast, and

Oh, whatwas I thinking,
trying to replace him

Hey, you did the best you could

You were always so strong

I feel like I'm losing you

You're not losing me
I'm right here

Been here

Okay?

Well, let's go, come on Yeah

One day you're gonna understand
