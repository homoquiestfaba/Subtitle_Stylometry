(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

BOY: "You are about to meet
a strange people

"in a strange enemy country.

"You must keep clear
of the Germans.

"You must not...

"...fraternize."

What does that mean?

It means we shouldn't be
friendly to them.


(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

This house is requisitioned
for British use

by order of
the Control Commission, Germany.

You'll forgive us, <i>Fraulein.</i>

WILKINS: It belongs
to a family Lubert.

He's an architect, sir.

SUSAN: Long.

Quick, let's get home.


Rachael.

Hello, Lewis.

My God. Look at you.

It's freezing.

It is.

Here.

Let me take this.

(ANNOUNCER SPEAKING
IN GERMAN ON RADIO)

Welcome. Please come inside.

Let me show you the house.

Please, come inside.
Let me show you the house.

(CHIMING IN DISTANCE)

LEWIS:
They're still finding bodies.

There's over 25,000 dead
still unaccounted for.

How are you?

Good. Fine. You?

It's...

It's been difficult.

For you, too, I expect.

For all of us.

We dropped more bombs
on Hamburg in one weekend

than fell on London
in the whole of the war.

That's different.

Yeah.

LEWIS: Thank you, Barker.

Colonel Morgan.

Welcome.
<i>Herr</i> Lubert.

Please come inside.
Let me show you the house.

This is my wife, Mrs. Morgan.

LUBERT: How do you do?

After you, Mrs. Morgan.
Thank you.

The finest room of the house.

It's lovely,
isn't it, darling?

RACHAEL:
It's very modern.

LUBERT: Yes, it is.

That's a Steinway.

An excellent instrument.
Yes.

Do you play?

Actually,
I've rather let it slip.

LUBERT: Well, it will be good
to have it played again.

What was up there before?

LUBERT: A painting.
It was damaged.

I haven't replaced it yet.

So the main staircase is
this way.

Our library.

LEWIS:
Herr Lubert's an architect.

LUBERT: Was.

Now I'm a metal press operator.

Shall we?

LUBERT: <i>Die Elbe.</i>

It flows all the way
to the, uh...

I'm sorry,
I don't have the English.

The <i>Deutsche See?</i>

North Sea.
The North Sea, yes.

It's all the same sea
in the end.

LUBERT: Indeed.

It's cold.
Can we go in?

I hope you can be
as happy here as we were.

My daughter and I
will stay out of your way

until we move to the camp.

Thank you.

RACHAEL (MUFFLED): You should
have told me, that's all.

RACHAEL:
What?

Thinking of our honeymoon.

My God.

You look beautiful.

You've still got this.

Of course.

(SIGHS SOFTLY)

You're smoking?

Dr. Mayfield said that it
would help with my nerves.

And has it?

The cabin, you remember?

With its leaky roof.

It rained for two weeks.
It did.

And, my God, that cold.

You burnt my books.

Well, I had to.
I had no choice.

It was Agatha Christie.

You might have waited
until I found out who did it.

The butler.
The butler always did it.

LEWIS:
Mm-hmm.

Happy times.

WILKINS: Good.
The governor's here.

LEWIS: Wilkins.

Sir.

They were hit delivering
food to the camp, sir.

A grenade, I believe.

Two of ours dead.

Bloody looters
are making it worse.

BURNHAM: Back!
Get them back!

BURNHAM: Push them back!
POLICE: Come on, move.

(CROWD CLAMORING)
SOLDIER: Get them off!

BURNHAM: Christ.

The breath on these people.

Yes, well, that's what

900 calories a day
does to you.

Well, at least they're less
trouble when they're hungry.

Keith Burnham,
Divisional Intelligence.

So what have we got?

Is that him?
WILKINS: That's the fella.

Looks like Werwolves. 88s.

Nazi bastards
who won't accept we've won.

LEWIS: Captain, can we have
these two boys taken care of?

WILKINS: Absolutely.

(YELLS IN GERMAN)

(GUNSHOT)
(PEOPLE SCREAM)

LEWIS: A medic!
Wilkins, get a medic.

WILKINS: Yes, sir!


BURNHAM: Thought so. 88.

<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

BURNHAM: Private.
Get our men on the truck.

And somebody bag this one up.


Oh. Hello.

You must be Freda.

Ooh, I see you have coffee.

Yeah, I'd... I'd prefer tea.

They don't really do tea.

I'll rustle some up
from the NAAFI.

Coffee it is, then.
No.

Sleep well?

Actually, I did.

Good.

That's really good.

I'm looking forward
to it being just us.

What?

Uh...

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

What if we let them
stay on?

The staff? Do we need them?

The Luberts.

So you mean...
Live with them?

I mean, they'd be
on the top floor.

Rach, we'd hardly notice
they're here.

Is everyone doing it?
Here.

It's not the same. No one else
has a house like this.

This isn't what we wanted.

The big house, the staff,
the art on the walls.

I know.

I thought we were going
to be together.

We are together.

Alone.

I...

I'm not comfortable with it.

With them.
Not comfortable with them

because they're Germans.

It's chaos out there, Rachael.

There's nowhere to put
these people.

There's nowhere to...

Nothing to feed these people.

There's...


It does... It makes no sense
to throw the Luberts out.

You didn't tell me
what I was walking into.

This isn't how
it was supposed to be.

None of this is how
it is supposed to be.

And yet here we are.


Thank you.

I'm very grateful.
You're very welcome.

Thank you.

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

(HEIKE GRUNTS)

Could, um...

Could one of you
help me, please?

I want to move the plants.

The plants?

They're blocking the light.

(CONVERSING IN GERMAN)

(LAUGHTER IN DISTANCE)

You don't like the chair?

It's a Mies van der Rohe.

"The house
of construction."

It's meant to be one of
the most comfortable chairs

ever invented.

Well, it isn't.

It's ugly.

He was of the Bauhaus school.

Their philosophy was
all about rejecting

unnecessary adornment.

Do you really need
a philosophy

to make something
comfortable?

Well, behind every object,
there is a philosophy,

isn't there?

<i>Herr</i> Lubert, please don't
creep about the house.

I thought we agreed
to keep to our own quarters.

Our "zones."
Yes, of course.

I will try to remember.

And if your daughter
wants anything from her room,

I'll get Heike
to bring it up to her.

This is all very new to her.

All the same.

I will make words with her.
Have words.

Sorry?
In English, you don't

"make" words with someone.

LUBERT: You should have these.
(KEYS JANGLING)

As the lady of the house.

Delicious, Heike.
<i>Danke schon,</i> really.

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

<i>Danke, Frau</i> Morgan.


Look, she's doing it again.
She's smirking.

Because you said
she was delicious.


I was making an effort.
I know.

(CASE OPENS AND CLOSES)

I don't know
how you do it.

What?

You go on like before,
all your little rituals.

Get up, shave.

Have a meal, go to work.

Like nothing had changed.
Please, Rachael.

I don't think it's healthy
to talk this way.

No?
No.

Oh.

No? How... How am I expected
to talk?

You might like
to set an example.

When did you get to be

Lawrence of Hamburg,

The one who went queer

He actually seems

Lew let them stay on.

Is that wise?

There may not be
an outward show of hatred,

but it's there
below the surface.

Be careful, that's all.
They're not like us.

Good afternoon.

(PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

Freda.

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

It's fine.

Please forgive her,

She should have asked

It's all right.
It's not.

She plays well.
She plays very badly.

She never practices.

Claudia despaired of her.

Claudia?

Her mother.

My wife.

Oh.

Is she somewhere

She died in the firestorm.

I'm so sorry.

No, thank you.

Well then. Good night.

LEWIS: Good night.

(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING

LEWIS: Still got it.
Keith won't be long.

We're so glad you could come.
Thank you.

Well, it's good
to finally meet you

and a relief to be
out of the house.

What a house, though.

It's almost worth
living with a German.

It's so funny.

You've got one, too.
A missing painting.

We have one just like it.

Everyone does.

It's where
they would have hung him.

Who?

The <i>Fuhrer.</i>

"The stain
that can't be removed."

They're usually clever enough
to cover them up.

Hmm.

BURNHAM:
Sorry to keep you. Apologies.

Thank you.

BURNHAM: Based on their answers,
we assign them a category

from black to white.

They're clean,

they get their <i>Persilschein,</i>

their laundry ticket.

It's the certificate

allowing them to return
to a normal life.

Does Lubert have
his <i>Persilschein?</i>

Does it matter?

Yes.

I think I have the right

to know if I'm living
with a Nazi.

Yes, I think it does matter.

I don't think
you can judge a person

by his answers
to a questionnaire.

No? How do you judge him?

You look him in the eye.

Lubert was never in uniform.
That's not the point.

Well, there was no blood
on his hands.

SUSAN: There's blood
on all their hands.

RACHAEL: Honestly, Lew,
I sometimes wonder whose side you're on.

Even after everything
that they've done...

LEWIS: The war is over.
We won.

That's the end of it.

Let's have dessert
in the drawing room.

Well, does he or not?

Not yet.

It's a formality.

SUSAN: Shall we?

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

SOLDIER:
Morning, sir.

SOLDIER:
Papers, ma'am.

Papers.

There you are.

Papers, sir.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

So you were building houses
for Nazi officials.

After 1933, we built
what we were told to build.

DONNELL:
Did the bombing affect

the health of you
and your family?

It's a simple question.

It affected the health
of my wife.

She was one
of the 40,000 killed

when British bombers
razed this city to the ground.

July 27th, 1943.

Well, let's talk
about your wife.

The money was hers?

Her family was wealthy, yes.

They owned a number
of shipping yards.

Shipping yards used
to transfer Nazi weapons?

LUBERT:
Among many other things.

You have to understand
that my wife and I

had nothing to do
with her family business.

Yet you claim to never
have joined the Nazi Party?

I was against everything
the Nazis stood for.

That wasn't my question.

No.

I was never a party member.

BURNHAM: Did you know
about the camps?

No.

So you've never seen these?

Here.

Have a look.

DONNELL:
One last question.

During the war, did you ever
hope for a German victory?

You answered,
"I wanted it to end."

I wanted to go back
to how it was.

What, you miss the past?
Is that it?

I miss my wife.

BURNHAM:
All right.

You'll hear from us
in due course.

(DOOR OPENS)

<i>Herr</i> Lubert?

<i>Herr</i> Lubert?

Could you come
in here, please?

Could you explain this?

It's a von Guerard.

I'm not asking what it is.

I'm asking
what it's doing here.

You objected to the stain,
so I covered it.

What's the matter,
don't you like it?

That's not the point.
What's it covering?

Does it offend you?

He was German,
maybe that offends you.

It was a picture of him,
wasn't it?

Of him?
Your <i>Fuhrer.</i>

It's simple for you.

The war ends.

You go home the winner.

Your conscience is clear.
Oh.

Is your conscience
not clear?

I thought you would like
the painting.

I apologize if I was mistaken.

Would you object
to a landscape?

A nice hunting scene perhaps?

I object to your tone.
(SHOUTS) Then throw us out!

<i>Herr</i> Lubert.
Throw us out.

You hate us.

It's what you want.

Throw us out.
Nobody said anything about...

We can leave you alone
to fight with your husband,

when he bothers to be here.

I think you've said enough.

Then throw us out.

Here. I'll give you a reason.

I think you should go.

in the Alps.

Near Oberstdorf.

It's not much now,
just a cabin,

a bit like this one.

Warmer, I hope.

I'm going to build a house.

Something very modern.

Just one floor...

set into the hillside...

with steel beams
and a glass wall

facing the beautiful
pine trees.

You can ski to the front door.

What do you think?

Could you live in it?

I don't know how to ski.

(BOTH LAUGH)

You're smiling.

I smile all the time.
Hardly ever.

Not since you came here.

I like you like this.

I never thought that I could be
happy like this again.

Then come with us.

You don't have your papers.

How will you travel?

They will clear me.

It's just a matter of time.

This is <i>Stunde Null.</i>

The Zero Hour.

Everything can start again.

(FREDA SPEAKING GERMAN)

(SPEAKING GERMAN)


I let him get to me. Leitman.

I shouldn't have.

He murdered children, sir.
Hmm.

If it was me,
I would have loaded the gun.

You would have loaded
the gun?

Yeah.

(BOTH LAUGH)

No, you wouldn't have.

Yeah. No, I wouldn't.

Dad always said I lack
the spine to be a soldier.

Yes.

Then I think your dad
probably gave you a compliment.

It's not the war
that makes men of us.

I've done things
I'm certainly not proud of.

I often wonder, my wife...

if she knew...
how she'd feel about me.

Let's get out of this
bloody cold and go home.

(SINGING INDISTINCTLY)

SUSAN:
Rachael.

Sorry I'm late.

Now, what's all this about?

RACHAEL:
I need a favor.

It's taking a long time
to clear Lubert.

What's your secret?

What?
Something's changed.

Oh, it's my hair.
I had it done.

No. Mmm.

Something else.

It's Christmas.

I've always liked Christmas.

Really?

I can't stand it.

Not Christmas
without children.

Oh, is the teddy bear
for the girl?

Yes.
And...

The cigars?

For my husband.
When he gets back?

Yes. For when he gets back.

Well, I suppose
I could ask Keith

what's taking so long
to clear him.

(PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

If you're going
to spy on a girl,

the least you could do
is pay her a compliment.

Hello, Rach.

(MUSIC STOPS)
LEWIS: I'm home.

Lewis.

Is Lubert around?

Uh...

I think he's in the garden.

Why?
He should join us.

I'm going to clean up.
I have some news.

(CORK POPS)

Oh.

What are we celebrating?

I've been offered a new post.

Ah.

Your trip was successful?

Successful? Well, um...

Let us see, shall we?

<i>Herr</i> Morgan?
Shall I prepare supper?

That won't
be necessary, Greta.

We're going out to
a regimental dinner tonight.

But you can please join us
for a glass of champagne.

Come on. Come in and join us.

A second Christmas.

Shall we say a Russian one.

A post? Where?

The War Office.

London.

We're going home.

So?

I've been cleared.

I knew it.

Congratulations. Burnham
must have pulled some strings.

That's really wonderful.
LEWIS: Yes, it is.

RACHAEL:
I, um... I don't understand.

You haven't finished
your work here.

Well, I put in a request.
I didn't want to tell you.

I didn't want you
to get your hopes up.

But we're going home.

Hmm?

So, from both of us,
I'd like to say thank you,

and to new beginnings.

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

Bertie?

Bertie?

Bertie.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

Right.

Sorry.

This dress, it isn't right.

He's downstairs.

Just tell him.

Tell him you're leaving
with me tonight.

I can't.
Then I will.

No, it has to come from me.

LEWIS: It's the same dress.
What?

Oh.

Yes.

My love.

Sir.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

SUSAN: Rachael!

Lew.
Yes?

We need to talk.

Colonel.

Just a minute.

LEWIS: General.
How are you?

LEWIS: Good, good.
How are you?

(DOOR CLOSES)


BROOK: You know
you'll be wasted in Whitehall.

Well, you're leaving this city

in better shape
than you found it.

Cheers.

Glad to be of service.

Sir.

PAMELA: Rachael.
Oh, Rachael.

PAMELA: Is it true?

What?
You're really leaving?

CELIA: Won't you miss it?

PAMELA:
What will she miss?

PAMELA: The staff?
The people.

Hmm.

I must say,
I'm surprised at you, Morgan.

For what?

I thought you'd prefer
to handle the matter yourself.

I have no idea
what you're talking about.

BURNHAM:
Ah, don't play innocent.

If you're so bloody convinced
Lubert's clean,

don't send your wife
to press his case for you.

(SONG ENDS)

(GUESTS APPLAUDING)

PAMELA: Do you really want
to go back to London rationing?

I'm sure
Lewis would forgive you

if you did choose to stay.

LEWIS: Susan.
Ladies. Excuse me.

Would you mind
if I borrowed my wife?

Please.

Tell me I'm wrong.

What I'm thinking...

Tell me I'm losing my mind.

Lewis...

I'm so sorry.


How long?

No, not here.
I was gone a few days.

How long have you
been fucking him?

Don't do this.
I want to know.

Why? What difference
does it make?

I want to know the moment
our marriage was over.

It's been over for years,
ever since Michael died.

Don't you dare
bring him into this.

Everything changed
when he died.

Why can't you admit it?

You left me.


It's my fault.
No, no.

It's mine.

Why can't you just say it?

Say it.

You blame me
for letting him die.

(GUESTS APPLAUDING)
(WEEPING)

Take me home.

Please, can you take me home?

Just get in. Get in the car.
Get in the car.

Give me the keys.

Give me the keys.
Here they are, sir.

(GUNSHOT)
(RACHAEL SCREAMING)

LEWIS: Rachael, get down.

Rachael, hold on.


Oh, dear God.
Rachael, are you hurt?

Are you hurt?
Lewis.

I'm going after him.

Lewis, Lewis.
It was two shots.

Stay in the car.
Just...

Hey!

(YELLS IN GERMAN)

(YELLS IN GERMAN)

I will fire! Stop!



(LEWIS YELLS IN GERMAN)

Bertie?


LEWIS: Stop or I will fire!
I will shoot!

You have nowhere to go!

(GUN COCKS)

(ICE CRACKING)

(LEWIS SHOUTS IN GERMAN)

(ALBERT SPEAKING IN GERMAN)

FREDA: Albert!


Freda, no.

It's too late.

FREDA: Albert!

Help me! Help me!

(SHOUTS IN GERMAN)
Albert!


Come on.

LEWIS: Just stay with me.
Stay with me.

Take him.

FREDA: Papa!
(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

I should never
have brought you here.

(SIGHS SOFTLY)

Can't blame you...

for wanting to start again.


(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

Huh?

Lewis?

Are you all right?

How is she?

She's sleeping.

He knows.

Good.

We should leave
in the morning.


(DOOR CLOSES)


Just go.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

How did it happen?

Was he in pain?

He was caught in the blast.

It was instant.

Yeah.


You know,
I never wanted to leave you.

I had to.

You know, I see his face...

every time I look at you.

When you laugh, I...

h-h-hear his voice.

I...

When I...

Every time I touch you, I...

I smell him on your skin.

You're the best part
of me, Rachael.

You always will be.



(CONTINUES SOBBING)

LUBERT: Rachael?

Ready?

(INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT
OVER PA SYSTEM)

Rachael?

No, no, no, no, no.

You're coming
with me.

I need you.

We needed each other.

But this is, this is
what you wanted.

To start again.

I do.

I do.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

Forgive me.

Rachael.

Papa!

Papa!
