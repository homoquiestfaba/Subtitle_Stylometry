You are all going to Hell!

Only God Almighty can save you.

Come rise out of
your physical refuge!

Read his holy words
before it's too late!

Satan and his minions
are hungry now.

Even as we speak,
the Devil's whisper is...

diabolical whenever
he's in your ears.

Time is running out!
The end is nigh.

There is evil
all around you.

All you have to do is look.

There is temptation
in every corner of our lives.

Wickedness, abomination,
corruption of the soul!

No one is safe,
especially the unbeliever.

The shadows grow long
on the road of pain...

I had a very difficult procedure
with Esther Anquist the other day.

That goddamned van of yokels
came roaring by, raising hell.

She had an aneurysm.
It just burst open like a ripe melon.

I'm a good doctor. I
did everything I could.

I cross-clamped
the aorta, but we...

...things would
be a lot different.

Yes, sir, you know they would.

First to go, them
pinhead town fathers.

Now Gus says he's gonna sue.

Doctor Fisher, my client
is certainly entitled to compensation...

for pain and suffering.

Pain and suffering, Gus?
The woman is dead.

Nothing but a bunch of old women.
Can't make their minds up about nothing.

If you want to sue someone,
why don't you sue the yokels in that van?

They're just expressing their
First Amendment rights to free speech.

I get it. You
represent them, too.

Tell them to express
it somewhere else.

Old fools.

"Smite with thine hand
and stamp with thy foot."

Watch it!
Look out!

Allburg used to be a quiet town.

Goddamned water-dunking
dunce-head!

Made me spill my wine!

Matty, are you okay? You all right?
Yeah, I guess so.

Come on, let's drag you up.

Wait a minute.

It's dead, man.

You want some?
No, thanks.

I'm a soda-pop girl, myself.

I don't want you
girls quarreling, now.

Grandma, don't worry.
That's when we were young.

'Bye, Mom.

Hi, Mrs. Barrett. I
can't talk right now.

I want to get to town
before the stores close.

Don't let those girls
give you too much trouble.

They won't give me any trouble.

When you get back,
I'll put supper on, if you like.

For the drive home.

No, I'm going to
be back after dark.

Don't you be late, now, Cindy.
Okay, Mom.

Now coming on 6:30
here at our studios...

at Briggs hardware building
in downtown Allburg...

where it's been penny-saver day.

They're open late
tonight, till 8:00.

Don't miss out. I didn't.

And I see outside the window, the mercury
is down to a comfortable 86 degrees.

It's been a typical
north Maine summer.

We've still got June
bugs hanging on...

and some pretty fat mosquitoes...

That's quite a collection of stuff
you've got there, Mrs. Barrett.

What's the one with the
seven heads and 10 horns?

Actually, there's quite a story...

It's getting pretty late. We
should get going before it gets too dark.

Yes, you'd better. You know me.

I can just sit
here and go on and on.

But when you get back, I'll
tell you all about it, if you'd like.

I'd really like
that, Mrs. Barrett.

Don't get Grandma started on
that stuff. She'll never stop.

We should've grabbed one of those bottles.
She never would have noticed.

Way to go.
Can you blow the smoke outside?

She'll have a stroke
if she catches you smoking in here.

Don't worry about it.

You got a flashlight in there?
Flashlight, towels, candles...

cigarettes, salt, and mints.

Mints?

I'm not coming home
with liquor on my breath.

How's your new school
in River Junction?

Fifty miles south,
and the faces look the same.

At least they don't treat me
like Little Orphan Annie.

I'm 17. I'm going
away to college.

I'm not scared of
old empty buildings.

Come on. Let's go.

This place makes me
feel like a little kid.

All small and frightened.

You never came up here
when this place was hopping.

My mom used to come
up here all the time...

without my dad.

I think something was really
bothering her back then.

How's your mom doing?

She's all right, I guess.

My uncle, the priest,
has been hanging around.

It's weird.

I think I like this place
just the way it is.

Why are we doing this?

You know the rules: "Every kid..."

"Who leaves Allburg
has got to swim in the crypt.

"Otherwise you'll never wash
the dirt of this town off you."

That's right. If you
don't, you'll be back.

This place is dirty!

Stop complaining.

This is creepy.

You know there are
dead people in here?

What do you expect in a crypt?
Dead squirrels?

Here, give me the candles.

It's not so bad. It's warm.

Check this out!

God, he was only 15.

Guess he never made
it out of Allburg.

He was probably lucky.

He croaked a couple of years
before all that killing started.

Don't start with
that old story now.

The bodies are still down here,
buried underwater forever.

Come on, cut it out.
It's bad enough in here.

The night before my mom and
I moved to River Junction...

I came down here
with Paul Dugginer.

He's got seven of
them on his legs.

What were you doing
down here with Paul?

I can't believe you waited till your
last night to seduce my old boyfriend.

Thanks, pal.

Besides, you never did anything
with him anyway.

It wasn't the right time.
He wasn't the right guy.

Have you ever met the right guy?
No, I haven't.

It's no big deal, Luce.

It's not that great.

Shit.

What's the matter?
I lost my necklace.

Let me look.

Lucy, help me, please!

There's somebody...
Swim!

Swim to the side!
Oh, my God!

There's somebody down there!

Oh, my God!

Help me, please!

"When the new-risen sun
Looks through the misty air

"Shorn of his beams,
or, from behind the moon

"In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight
sheds fear on half the nations

"Darkened so

"Above them all the Archangel

"Waiting revenge. Cruel
his eye, but cast

"Signs of remorse and
passion, to behold

"The fellows of his
crime, the followers

"condemned For ever now
to have their lot in pain"

So, who do you think
Uncle Milty's talking about?

The werewolf?

Satan?

Yes. Exactly.

And what is he saying...

about Satan?

That he's really mean and evil
and can really hurt people.

But he's a very proud person
who has been dumped on a lot.

But he's strong and can do
whatever he wants to do...

even if it means living in
Hell and hurting others.

Very perceptive. Excellent.

I think we can leave Uncle
Milty now and his lost paradise.

And won't that be a relief?

Mr. Gardner, where do they get these ideas
for the monsters in the books?

I guess they based them
on people of the time...

who did horrible, evil things.

People who tortured and murdered
for the pleasure of it.

Okay, Jesse.

Go get in the car.
I'll be right there.

Very good job, Jesse.

I'm glad I came by early.

Now I know the garbage
you've been teaching my daughter.

Mrs. Blake, when you first
brought your daughter here...

you said she was very slow.

She's not slow.

She's a very smart girl with
an extremely short attention span.

Jesse loves ghost
and monster stories.

She's becoming an
excellent reader.

This type of reading is inappropriate
for a young Christian girl to study.

Mrs. Blake, she's reading!
What difference does it make what?

This is classic literature,
and she's reading.

This is blasphemous literature.

I'd rather Jessica be ignorant
than to have her reading...

about defiant, perverse,
godless souls.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to frighten anyone.

Are you okay?
How do I look? Do I look okay?

You're the one
person I can trust.

I need your help.

Sure, you've always helped me
whenever you could. What is it?

I've fallen in love
with a woman.

And something horrible
is happening.

What the hell is...

Frank, when did you
start drinking?

Last week.

Couldn't even smell this
stuff without gagging.

Now it just barely
calms me down.

Sure you don't want any?
No, thanks.

I keep it handy.

Swiss. The best. I've got it set to the
Navy's laser clock in Bethesda, Maryland.

Accurate to a tenth of
a second every 10 years.

Frank, what the
hell is going on?

Remember when you
were in the seminary?

You came and said
you had fallen in love...

with the most
beautiful woman on Earth.

Yes, it's when I realized
that I wasn't cut out to be a priest.

I tried to talk you out
of leaving the seminary.

It was a good effort.

One of my few, yes.

You remember what I
confessed to you then?

I remember your affair.

Do you know whose
house this is?

This was my brother's house.
You were at his funeral.

I remember you there with
that girl, the new one.

Afterwards I consoled the loved ones.
I took care of things.

Then I started to come
by the house every day.

Help his widow, Karen.

Take her daughter Cindy to school
and just be there if Karen needed someone.

It sounds
compassionate, doesn't it?

That wasn't why I
was hanging around.

It wasn't humane or altruistic.

Do you know what it was, Mark?

I was in love... with
my dead brother's wife.

I was obsessed with her!
I had to be around her all the time!

Frank, these things happen.
You don't understand!

I never told you the worst part.
You have to understand.

The woman that I had that
affair with 10 years ago?

That was Karen Thompson,
my sister-in-law!

God damn me to Hell,
I slept with my brother's wife!

And not just once.
Time and time again!

What in God's name was that?

What is that up there?

I have committed
a terrible sin...

and now it is she
who is paying for it.

One minute and nine seconds.
Then, show-and-tell.

Will you please just tell me
what's going on?

That's when this day ends.
Sunset at 7:21 and 16 seconds exactly.

That's the beginning
of Karen and Cindy's day.

Karen and Cindy?
You mean they're in there?

Look.

Fifty-eight seconds
of daylight left.

Oh, my God, Frank.
There's a girl drowning in there!

No, she's not drowning.
It's how they live now.

When daylight comes,
they hide from the light.

Each seeks their own grave...

Cindy in the tub,
Karen in a cocoon-like coffin.

But when night falls, they feed.

They feed and torment.

Six seconds of daylight left.

Five, four, three, two, one.

Watch!

I know. I was like you...

wondering what
happened to reality.

What happened to them?
What does it look like?

Hiding from the daylight,
biting necks, drinking blood...

They think they're vampires?
Think?

Three days ago I came by
to check on things.

Karen had gone to Allburg to pick
up Cindy, who was visiting a friend.

It was the morning.
Good timing on my part.

Otherwise they
would have killed me.

Here. Listen to this.

What the fuck is this?

The phone number Karen left
when she went to pick up Cindy.

Cindy's friend is a
girl named Lucy Barrett.

She lives with her grandmother, Hillary.
I know Lucy.

This is her number.

I've called the house several times now.
It's always the same.

I don't know what
the hell is going on...

but those two girls have to go
to the hospital right now.

Your brain isn't accepting the facts!
They're vampires, Mark.

You can't take them
to the hospital...

cure it with penicillin or group therapy.
They'd have to destroy them.

I can't let that
happen to Karen.

She's been cursed for my sins.

Now the mother's sins have
been brought down on the daughter.

I went to the library.
I researched this.

"1568. Romanian priest.

"Known to have tortured and
murdered over 200, maybe more.

"Mostly young children.

"He was previously found in
a well, under 20 feet of water.

"When removed,
found to have a pulse.

"Accordingly, head was severed
from body and set on fire."

Come on, Frank.

It says they caught the guy.
They cut off his head.

Do you think there's just one?
Besides, he could have tricked them.

Vampires can change into
animals or wisps of smoke.

Or the townspeople lied.
They didn't want to start a panic.

I don't know what this
has to do with anything.

Those girls up there need help!

We can't take them to the
hospital, the police or anybody.

They'd kill them!
It's that simple.

The only way to help them is to
find the source of the vampirism.

I must stay here and take
care of Karen and Cindy.

I need your help, Mark.
I need you to go to Allburg.

Yes, go to Allburg.

Go to Grandma Barrett's house.
Find out what's going on.

Karen and Cindy were
at that house.

Whatever happened to them
may have happened to the Barretts.

You heard the phone.

I tutored Lucy Barrett.

Then help her. Please.

Go find out what's
going on. Please.

It had better be
important, young man!

Waking up an old gal
like me at this hour!

I'm very sorry.
My name's Mark Gardner.

I'm a good friend of Frank Aldin's.
Father Aldin.

Karen and Cindy's
friend. Of course.

Come on in, young man.
Let me get you something to eat.

Eat as much as you like.
I have plenty more.

A strong young man like you
needs to eat as much as he can.

You can understand how
concerned I am about this.

Of course.

It sounds like Karen and Cindy
need attention right away.

But if you ask me, those
girls just need a lot of good food.

When I feel a cold or
the flu coming on...

I just make myself a
big, juicy hamburger with...

all the fixings.

Would it be possible for
me to talk to Lucy?

Well, to tell the truth,
she's locked herself in her room.

She won't come out.
Not even for dinner.

Why?
I don't know why.

Maybe she's upset about something.
You know how teenage girls can be.

Do you think it's possible
that she knows that...

That what? That Karen
and Cindy are vampires?

Don't be silly, young man.

I'd really feel a lot better
if I could talk to her myself.

If you're going to be
insistent upon it, all right.

But I think that she's really
barricaded herself in pretty good.

What the...

Get off me!

Break the door! Kick it in!

I'm sorry. I killed
her. She's crazy.

She's not crazy,
she's a vampire!

You're a rough young
whippersnapper, aren't you?

Do you want to go
two out of three?

You killed your grandmother!
Yeah, I thought you killed her.

Besides, I thought
you were a teacher.

Right there. Want some more?

It's here, son.

Sir, I guess so.

Where are you from, soldier?

Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sr.

Mother, stop it!

What the fuck is
going on up there?

What the fuck is going on?

Why don't you come up here
and find out for yourself?

Stop!

Leave her alone!

Shut up, Frank!

Think we'll ever get home, sir?
Don't worry, son.

I have some projects...

Come on, men. Put on your
radiation suits. We're going over.

This has gotta be some
kind of joke. A gag.

Oh, God.

All right, stay
calm. Don't panic.

I'm sorry. I guess I didn't
realize how fast I was going.

License and registration.
Yours, too, young lady.

You were going at
least 30 miles an hour...

over the speed limit.

That's felony speeding.
What's the hurry?

It's just that I have
my girlfriend out really late.

Her father's very strict.
He's gonna be pretty pissed at me.

Don't bullshit me, pal.
No, sir.

Ma'am.

I have a runaway report on you
from a Hillary Barrett.

My grandmother?
You're gonna have to come with me.

Where?
Where do you think?

Back to Grandma's. Come on.

I mean, she's with me.

She can do whatever she wants...

I suggest you just keep driving
to River Junction under the speed limit...

and start dating
girls your own age.

'Cause if I ever catch you in my town
again, driving around late at night...

with a minor in your car,
I will haul your butt in.

It's not like that.

Come on. You're going
back to your grandma's...

so the poor old lady
can have her peace of mind back.

Yeah, they love Gran.

Please move your
vehicle along. Go home.

Go to bed.

Let's go!

I don't have all night.

This is the police department.

This is the police department.

We have another family massacre
out at Doug Inn.

All available units...

All these backwater people.

They're born, raised and eventually die
in the same square two miles...

of their dismal little hometowns.

And they love it.

In their minds, there isn't
anything worth doing or seeing...

or reading, that involves getting
off their big old white butts...

for longer than it takes to go
to the fridge and get a beer.

Unless it's blasting small
animals with a.30-06.

I have had it with
these country bumpkins!

They're intolerant and they
don't think for themselves!

They're like sheep!

Why don't you go back
to New York or wherever?

Because I fell in love and married
one of these cow-tipping dimwits!

He's been gone three weeks
on a hunting trip...

probably drunk on beer,
shooting at anything that moves!

Bastard!

So, how about you?

Why would you want to go and
scare your poor old grandma to death?

I've been having
some problems with her.

I think she's senile or something.

She thinks I'm trying to hurt her.
She gets really violent.

She even tried
to bite me once.

It sounds like she really
might need some help.

I'm gonna regret this.

It's all right. You don't
have to talk to her tonight.

She might be confused or upset
if you wake her up.

I'm sure she's up, worrying
and waiting up for you. Come on.

Let's go.

You really don't know her.

Strangers really bother her.

She gets very disoriented,
especially when she's asleep.

Oh, my! I've been so worried.

I was worried that something
horrible had happened to you.

Come in, dear.

She was just down on
Main Street, eating a pizza.

She lost track of the time.
A pizza. That's fine.

I was worried when
you missed dinner.

A young girl has got to
eat to stay healthy.

But never mind about that.

Come in, Lucy. I was just
about to have a late snack.

Officer, would you like
some late dinner?

Thanks, I'd love to, but I'm
on duty. I gotta make my rounds.

You can't leave me!
No, you don't understand!

She's a vampire!

Please don't leave me!
Look under her hat!

She has a golf club
stuck in her head!

Hey, what are you guys...

Come on.

It's party time!

Come on.

Damn it, Frank,
answer the phone.

What happened to the music?

Give me something
I can move to!

I think he's coming.

And he sounds mad!

Are you gonna
save me, Frankie?

Shut up, damn you!
What's the matter, Frank?

Are we bothering you?
Are we making too much noise?

Are we having too much fun?

Shut up. Damn you!

What's the matter, Father Aldin?
You can't hack the graveyard shift?

This isn't a convenience store!

Please. I'm trying to help you.
Help me?

By chaining me to the bed?

You know I can't let you go.
They'll destroy you.

But I'm hungry.

Cin doesn't look so good anymore...

and she's getting pretty sick
of eating leeches!

You're not dealing with any devils!

You're not Karen. You've
been inhabited by something else.

Another spirit is
using your body.

Oh, come on, Frank.

It's you who wants
to use my body.

Now open the door and
let's get on with it!

Stop it!

That indiscretion
has manifested itself...

into this putrid
corruption of the soul!

Feeling regretful, Frank?

I guess that's pretty standard
in your line of work.

I'll never apologize
for the way I am.

I like it.

If I want someone's
blood, I'll take it!

I'll suck it through my teeth
and let it coat my throat.

Thrill my stomach.

And I'm not ashamed
of what I am...

what I want,
and how I want it.

And I want you.

My soul...

my flesh craves you.

Did you see her yet?

She'll be getting ready for
bed about now. She's a fox.

I've seen all
the girls in town...

and this one's got the nicest,
roundest, firm pair of...

Who the hell are you?

You wanna get a good look at her?
Sure.

I know how to see into all the
houses around here. Come on.

It might be Mr. Bubble night.

"...lie down in green pastures:
He leads me beside still waters.

"He restores my soul:

"He leads me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

"Even though I walk through..."
What are you doing that for?

"...fear no evil:
For thou art with me...

"thy rod and thy staff they comfort me."
It's just a waste of time.

"Thou preparest the table
before me in the presence..."

What has prayer ever
done for you, Frank?

What painful secret...

torments and compels you...

to kneel at my door?

"Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

"I fear no evil: For thou art..."
Listen to me.

"Thy rod and thy staff
they comfort me."

I love you.

Yes, it's true.

And you love me.

Check her living room window.

Check her living room window.

Sometimes when her grandma's gone,
she dances to music in her underwear.

What's that old
lady doing in there?

Get out of here.

Get lost. Beat it!

Get out of here!

Do it!

Goddamn it! You're a vampire!

I guess we got her that time.
Untie me!

I'm a teacher. I have a degree.
It's on my wall in River Junction.

I'll show it to you.
Look out!

All right. We'll find another road.
I mean, there's gotta be other roads.

How did he get here?

Go home! Get the
hell out of here, kid!

Jeez, what happened?
Nothing. Now just go home!

But they got the lady cop.

I saw them dragging her into the lodge.
Who?

I don't know. They looked
like some people from town.

Oh, my God! Officer Gates?
We have to help her!

What are you, crazy?
We just can't leave her there.

Why not? She left
you for vampire meat.

She didn't know what was
going on. She was nice to me.

Someone got the word out before
to stop us from leaving town.

Who says it won't happen again?
We need the police on our side.

All right. Get in.

But I'm telling you right now
I think this is a really bad idea.

There, that's the place.
They took her in the hunting lodge?

This isn't good.

Billy, do you know any way we
can get closer without being seen...

so we can see if
she's in there?

I only checked
out the ladies' room.

There's a great peek
through the air vent...

but there's a window, or skylight,
or something up there.

That ought to work.

What is it that you want?

What do you need most of all?

What is it that your
soul needs to live?

Oh, my God! It's Vampire
City down there.

Another fun-filled night in Allburg.

What the hell
is that all about?

The master's appetite
is considerable tonight.

But, of course,
this is comeback night.

He's looking forward
to seeing you again, Lucy.

You want to go inside and get
to know some of the locals?

I've seen them all naked.

Take me, Frank. Make me yours.

Please, God, forgive me.

You little bastard bloodsucker!

What are you, some kind
of vampire gofer boy?

I am the direct manifestation
of my master's desires.

I am known as a familiar...

one who can go amongst
the unknowing mortals...

without causing suspicion
or arousing alarm.

What master? Who are you talking about?
He whom I serve.

He who gives me ethereal life
and saves me from the animal curse.

He is Czakyr.

Goddamn it, leave me alone!
You'll rot in Hell for this, you little punk!

They smell. They know.
What?

That Lucy's been a good girl,
remained pure and unspoiled.

A virgin's blood
enlivens vampires.

The flavor is intoxicating
to a night-feeder.

It sends them
reeling in ecstasy.

You're a little shit,
you little pervert!

Yes, we do.

Let me go, you
sick old bastards!

Let me go, you
sick old bastards!

I'm a cop, for Christ's sake!

That hurts.

You are pissing me off big time.
And it is not a pretty sight.

Ask my husband.

Oh, my God.

Let go!

That's right. Come and
get it, you ugly bastards.

Mayor Horton, Gus
Willman, Doc Fisher?

Look at yourselves!

Oh, my God, I should've known...

you backwater assholes
would follow a dead priest...

slinking around at night,
drinking people's blood.

You have never had any
respect for the law.

Come on, froggy. Jump!

Lucy, come on! Let's go!

Master, the prize!
We lost the prize!

Over here! Master,
I've got them!

You keep going! I'll catch up!

Master, I have them.

I told you I'm not a vampire.

Son of a bitch.

Lucy, where are you?

There is good news, people!

Jesus is your friend.
If you have...

If you feel detested...

unwanted and unable to feel
the goodness all around you...

Jesus understands.

If your cup is empty...

he will fill it
to overflow it.

Enter his world...

Come on!

...with him and
he will love you.

Let's go. Come on, get in!

You're waiting for the old bat
boy to come back and bite you?

Hallelujah, dear friends.
Jesus Christ is your savior...

and his father is the
one and only true God.

He is awesome and
infinite, holy and just...

Ioving and compassionate,
ruling the universe with truth...

and power.

I don't know who hates
this preaching more...

them skunking neck-biters
out there or me!

Where the hell did you come from?
Originally, Detroit.

My mom and dad moved there
during the Depression.

Fled north from...
Matty's a regular around Allburg.

Official town drunk,
to be more precise.

That's not half bad.

I used to think nothing could
beat a pint of Fleischmann's...

but I don't know. There's something
to be said for smoothness.

And you can't beat the price.

The shop owners around here
spend their days in a sack of water.

I'll get you out of
town before first light...

and then get myself back in
before noon for a good day's sleep.

You're gonna come back here?
Of course I'm coming back.

I grew up here. And besides,
I kind of like being...

the only upstanding
citizen in Allburg.

This leads up to the old
lumber mill. This is Mill Road.

What's up there?
Nobody, I hope.

Won't they look for us up there?
I don't know.

But I got to admit, since they been
hanging around the old bat boy...

they've gotten clever.

Maybe he's beaming his brainwaves
at them or something.

I don't think they
take a fancy to me.

Probably too old
and liquored up.

And besides, I am a bit
of a night person myself.

That's when I come alive.

My head is clear, and it
don't get too fogged up...

till near morning.

But the night's for me.

That's when I do my best
thinking, during the night.

And that's when them rascals
are out shopping for a meal.

I'm curious about something.

How did you come to save us
just at the perfect time?

That's all right.

If I was you or your boyfriend,
I wouldn't trust me, either.

Boyfriend?

I heard a racket
down by the lodge...

and I figured they had
finally gotten Officer Gates.

I always liked Gates.

She thought Allburg was a
town of thick-headed hillbillies.

I guess she didn't even notice
a change over these people.

I drove down here
to help her out.

Then I saw her patrol car
parked at the lodge.

I guess they got her.

Do you know anything about the
old church on Cherry Street?

What about it?

I went down there,
in the crypt.

I saw something
come out of the water.

It grabbed my friend Cindy...

and I thought it killed her.

But when I went home to get help,
she was there with her mother...

and my grandmother.

They weren't the same.

This ain't exactly my
favorite story to tell.

If you know something, we'd sure
appreciate it if you'd tell it.

I was a couple of years out of
school, and working at the mill...

when this Father Vlado fella
come in from Europe.

A grown man playing funny games
with the Sunday school kids.

And a priest at
that. Bad business.

No one wanted it talked about.

The local people decided they'd
take care of it themselves.

But Father Vlado thought
he'd beat them to it.

So he went down to the crypt
and killed himself...

and took some of
the kids with him.

An awful sight.

No one wanted to go near him.

They figured they'd flood the
crypt and leave the bodies.

And then nobody went near
that damn place again.

I was in charge of the water
chute at the mill, then.

And I was to see to the
flooding of the crypt.

It wasn't hard.

I just knocked a hole
in the lower part of the wall...

near a natural spring.

Had 40 or 50 gallons...

a minute, flowing.

I'll never forget
some of the things.

Like the pieces of rope...

knotted tight around the necks
of those poor little children.

And the way the steam rose
from their bodies...

when the water hit them.

It was not a particularly
easy day's work.

Do you think that was an animal?
Yeah, a big one with fangs.

Be careful.

It's over here.

That little sucker is
running pretty fast.

Where is it?

Check the windows.

There's nothing over here.

Where the hell did
the damn thing go?

Stick him! Quick!

Damn! You do that real well.

God, I'm getting good at this.

I should have known.

Lawyers. Always
the slipperiest.

Even when they're
the walking dead.

Are you okay?

Let's get that thing out of here.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Too much blood set
around here as it is.

I guess you're right.

You know, they said something
about being able to smell...

Lucy.
Smell Lucy?

Why her?

Apparently, she's been...

a good girl.
A virgin, all right?

Virgin or not, it's
all right with me.

I don't place too much
importance on such matters.

Unfortunately that thing does.
It's crazy for her blood.

I'm sorry.

I think we should all try
to get some sleep.

You go first. Matty
and I'll keep watch.

How long has it been
since you've had some sleep?

Go on, relax. Matty
and I'll keep watch.

Thanks.

Go to sleep.

How are we doing with
that illegal Regal?

She's a tough little
flower, ain't she?

And pretty, too.

She's not my girlfriend.

Well, young fella,
I'd get on the job if I were you.

Gus Willman never had a woman...

that was better-Iooking
than a dead toad.

And now, he's dead.
What do you think of that?

You can't find many good-Iooking women
around these parts, you know.

You know, Matty...

I was studying to be a priest.

Say what?

I always seemed to lose
the calling, though.

Only time I ever
heard singing of angels...

is when I gaze into
a face like that.

God bless you, young fella.

I'm sorry, Mother.

Is that you?

Is your mother okay?

Lucy, it's me.

Don't wake them up.

Are you all right?

This vampire thing's a snap.

All I have to do is lay in a tub of
water all day, and eat live leeches.

I'm sorry I asked.

I'm living in the shadows, Luce.
Everything is in a dull, gray fog.

Nothing is the same.
Nothing is real.

I can't smell things
the way I used to.

I can't feel or even see
things the way I used to.

I tried smoking a cigarette.

My lungs don't even inhale.

Nothing is fun anymore.
Everything's about eating.

Killing and eating. And this
eternal-life thing's a real joke.

How'd you like to live forever with
a bunch of boring, depressing people...

who might as well be dead?

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry
I left you in the crypt.

I just got so scared.
I didn't know what to do.

It's all right. You
couldn't have helped me then.

But you can help me now.

Yes, we'll all help.

Czakyr thirsts for you
more than for them.

We'll be drawing him and the others away
from here. Then your friends will be safe.

It won't do any good
bringing them along.

We're going kamikaze, Luce.

We either do this or we
wander the Earth forever...

searching for bugs
and night crawlers...

and little animals
to stuff our tummies.

I hate him for
what he did to me.

Don't you want to end this?

What do we have to do?

We go back to the church.
We free those children.

We destroy his hiding place
and we kill that asshole.

Then the people of Allburg will
have a chance to return to normal...

so to speak.

Damn it! You let me fall asleep!
I let you?

Shit, she's gone!
They must've got her!

What the fuck are we gonna do?
Get a grip. She left on her own.

What are you talking about,
you dumb drunk? She's gone!

Can't you figure that out,
you dumb fucking wino?

If those fangers had gotten her...

we'd have wound up with two inches
of pointed diggers in our necks.

I'm sorry. I'm
just really scared.

It's all right, son.
I've been called a lot worse in my day.

What do you think happened to her?
Where could she go?

The church. Don't you remember
the story she told us...

about losing her best
friend in that crypt?

She wouldn't go there alone.
Where else would she go?

There's nowhere else to go,
and nothing left to do...

except to go and be a hero
and stick that sucker. Come on.

Matty and the townspeople
of 50 years ago...

only knew part of the story.

Father Vlado Czakyr
was no priest.

He escaped from Europe when
his kind were being killed off.

He's a vampire.
No shit.

And the children are not dead.

They were, and
are, still alive.

So where are the children now?
They're still here.

Trapped in Czakyr's water grave,
so he could feed off them...

like my mother
was feeding off me.

If he needs to,
he'll hide again.

This time he wants to
take you with him.

No, I don't want to be
down there with them.

Let's start fucking
up his plans.

Burn, baby. Burn.

Just wait till old fang-face
gets a load of this.

Let's go.

Come on. We gotta stay on our toes.
We're getting really close.

I'm right there with you, kid. I'm just
trying to loosen up for vampire combat.

Keep an eye on the back for bogies.
Bogies.

Oh, no.
What?

Don't those ugly things got
anything better to do at night?

Not really. We got
some on our tail?

Just a few. Step on it, Matty!

Watch out! Bogies to the
port side. 10 o'clock.

Let's give them a
taste of Sir Lancelot.

Eat wood, you bucktoothed
son of a bat.

I missed him.

Do you think...

Kill it!

For God's sake, a milkman!

This town is a
real embarrassment.

Fuse and arm the warheads!

Holy shit! There must be
half a dozen cars back there!

Fuse and arm the warheads!

I'm doing it!

Help me!

Pilot to bombardier! Target!

Target approaching!
Damn, we're too late!

Looks like they got
the same idea we did.

Help me!

Get out of here! Go!

Hold them off as long as you can!
Piece of cake!

Round them up! Move them out!

Howdy, dear friends. Jesus Christ
died on the cross for our sins.

Now, it's your turn.

He killed Cindy!

We're in deep shit!

Come on.

Get up! Get along there,
little bat boys!

Trust me, I'm a doctor.

I'll hit the vein!

And don't come back,
you stupid hyenas.

Ugly, flightless vultures!

What the hell!

Bingo!

Let her go!

You big, dumb...

ugly fuck!

Bingo!

Beggars can't be choosers.
Get off me, you bloody quack!

I think my drinking days...

have just come to
an abrupt conclusion.

Take it easy.

Look, it's the children.

They're free now.
They're finally free.

What a nightmare!

What's all that blood?
This isn't my operating room.

Nurse, bring me
a cigarette, stat!

Jesus H. Christ, Ed!
It's a catastrophe.

I got half the town lined up
over at my clinic.

Been pulling splinters out
of their chests all day long.

Everyone looks a
bit peaked, too.

Ain't been feeling
too well myself, either.

You know, it could be meningitis.

That's an epidemic, Ed.
What are you gonna do about it?

We got to talk
business here, man.

I see a lot of changes
for this old town.

We gotta start attracting
new blood to Allburg.

People with disposable income.

Allburg used to be a quiet town.
