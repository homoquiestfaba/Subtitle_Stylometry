has decimated a major</i>

<i>hospital today in Istanbul.</i>

<i>10 Americans,
including one US surgeon</i>

<i>and his daughter,
are counted among the dead.</i>

<i>There are more than
100 confirmed casualties</i>

<i>and 79 injured with
the toll expected to rise.</i>

<i>The facility was crowded
at the time of the blast,</i>

<i>having admitted
many patients injured</i>

<i>in a car bombing incident
nearby just three days ago.</i>

<i>This is
the most significant attack</i>

<i>on a medical facility
in years.</i>

<i>And so far no organization
has claimed</i>

<i>responsibility for
the bombing.</i>

[Ryan on phone] <i>Audrey's
been helping the nurses</i>

<i>with their rounds
on the wards.</i>

<i>You're having so much fun
at the hospital, aren't you?</i>

[Audrey on phone]
<i>Mommy, Mommy,</i>

<i>I went to the hospital
again with Daddy.</i>

<i>I got a teddy from
Doctor Hamza.</i>

<i>It's called Medi Bear.</i>
[Ryan laughs]

<i>to feel better.</i>
[both laughing]


<i>Get outta here.</i>
[Audrey gigging] <i>Hey!</i>

I gotta go back to emergency</i>

<i>so I'll be unreachable
for the rest of the day.</i>

<i>I love you, Abby.
See you soon, my love.</i>

the world for my work.</i>

He never complained.

He never cared
where we ended up

as long as he could help

people in need.

But being...

a doctor always...

came second to being a dad.

â™ª â™ª

Audrey. You were a shining light
in a dark world.

I'm sorry for putting you both

in harm's way.

I'm sorry I couldn't save you.

Abby.</i>

Ryan couldn't have known
what he was walking into.

His work was so important.
The agency owes you a debt.

Look, I've read
all your reports.

Everyone at the agency has.

I'm getting a lot of pressure
to keep you here stateside.

Wait, and use secondhand intel?
That's not enough.

Frankly, I have people who are
better suited for this job.

You aren't considering

your personal
connection to this incident.

This is not
like your other postings.

These people are dangerous.

We built this place
to fight terror with terror.

We do things that no one
will ever know about.

Abby, you're
a hell of an analyst.

But burying yourself out there
in the desert chasing ghosts,

it is not going
to change what happened.

I need to be the one
asking the questions

and I need to be looking them
in the eye

when they give the answers.

I said my piece.

You'll be on a transport
to Citadel in 72 hours.

I'll brief you en route.

Oh, and Abby? I know you like
to play things by the book.

These people,
where you're going,

they don't exactly like reading.

Catch my drift?

Drift caught, sir.

Watch your back, Abby.
And keep your focus.


Good luck.

â™ª â™ª

[man on radio]
<i>There's a secret base, Abby,</i>

<i>in the Jordanian desert,
codenamed Citadel.</i>

<i>Its purpose is top secret
intelligence sharing</i>

<i>between five English-speaking
democracies</i>

<i>known as
the Five Eyes Alliance.</i>

<i>The Five Eyes includes
the United States,</i>

<i>United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.</i>

<i>Because of its location,
there's also a representative</i>

<i>from the Israeli
intelligence community,</i>

<i>which you know as Mossad.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>In addition to protecting
its array of servers,</i>

<i>the site is also used to hold</i>

<i>and interrogate suspected
terrorists</i>

<i>from around the world.</i>

<i>Good luck.</i>

[treadmill whirring]



<i>Are you sure
he isn't misleading you?</i>

that backs up his story.</i>

<i>It couldn't have
been a lone bomber, Silas.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>Subject 99423,
interrogation 009.</i>

<i>Let's try this again, Farhan.</i>

<i>Did Hatchet
give you any indication of</i>

<i>who his source was
in Istanbul?</i>

[Farhan chuckling]
<i>I don't know why he was there</i>

<i>and I don't want to know.</i>

<i>You are not different to me.</i>

<i>You don't tell
the CIA what to do with</i>

<i>the information you recover.</i>

<i>Cut the crap, Farhan.</i>

<i>He was looking for someone and
I think you know who.</i>

about the bomb in Istanbul.</i>

<i>I am just going about
my business to feed my family.</i>

<i>My last communication
was to connect him to</i>

<i>a friend of mine at
Kyzaghan Enterprises.</i>

in Ankara?</i>

<i>It was one of your couriers.
Farhan.</i>

<i>I know it wasn't you.</i>

<i>Give me the info I need and
I'll help you get out of here.</i>

in Ankara.</i>

<i>You don't understand.
I am a businessman.</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>Are you responsible
for the people who die</i>

<i>because of what you do? Huh?</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[heavy metal music playing]

[man shouting
in foreign language]

You haven't eaten.

You know, the way we work
here is real simple.

Okay, you stay in your cell,
you shit in your can.

When I say it's time for chow,
you fucking eat.

Eat your fucking food, Farhan.



[music continues]

can't you speak?

Huh?

[both grunting]


Miller!

[Farhan coughing]

Outside.

[music stops]

What the hell
is going on in there?

He's refusing to eat.

I'm encouraging him.

Look, I know that you think that

you're still first battalion,
but you're not, all right?

You're an employee of the CIA,
and as long as

I'm in charge here,
we play by the book.

Oh, we're gonna play
by the book.

Okay. That's cute.

[chuckles darkly]

What the fuck do you want?

Do you want me to write you up
and send your ass home?

Is that what you're after?

No, but what I would
appreciate...

Uh-huh?
...is for once,

while you're up there drinking
your tea and eating your cake,

you try to... try to imagine
what it is we do down here.

You know?

Do you think it's a coincidence

every time you grace us with
your presence,

these motherfuckers start
getting all chatty?

Are you done?

It's because Briggs and I
butter 'em up.

We set the table.

I've never ordered that.

No, but it's expected.

No. I expect better.

[Farhan coughing]


â™ª â™ª

[Farhan coughing]

He looks dehydrated,
get him some water.

[Farhan chuckles] This is how
you live with yourself, huh?

Small acts of mercy
in a torture chamber.

I'm the only friend
you have right now.

That company
you told us about in Ankara,

Kyzaghan Enterprises,

the one you trade with
in fertilizers.

Turns out that they're
a major supplier for

a terrorist organization,

Look, I'm a businessman, okay?

I buy and I sell from
whoever wants to trade with me.

It's been three weeks now

and I told you
everything I know.

No, you haven't, Farhan.

You've given me
a few bread crumbs

mixed in
with a ton of horseshit.

Now, in our last interview,
you mentioned Hatchet.

How do you know Hatchet?

I want you to identify him
for me please.

Is it this guy?

Or is it this one?

[Farhan laughs darkly]

All I know for sure
is you don't want to meet

that sadistic madman
or do business with him.

<i>I just connected him
with my contact</i>

<i>purely for business purposes.</i>

<i>Talk to</i> [indistinct].

He probably has unfinished
business in Ankara. [chuckles]

[Farhan coughing, chuckling]

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

[man on recording] <i>Hey baby,
I found a document</i>

<i>that connects
the fertilizer transaction</i>

<i>to Kyzaghan Enterprises
in Istanbul,</i>

<i>probably worth
checking out.</i>

<i>Oh, and by the way,
I found a restaurant.</i>

<i>It is gonna blow your mind.</i>
[knocking on door]

<i>Don't worry baby,
it's only a few more weeks.</i>

<i>This posting in Istanbul will
be over before you know it.</i>

[Mia] Abby?
[man] <i>Nearly there.</i>

Abby.
[man] <i>Love you.</i>

Hey, sorry. [chuckles]

Rashid wants you in
the rec room, it sounded urgent.

In the rec room?

Yeah, I don't know.
That's just what he said.

For the record, I'm gonna
miss having you around.

I'm gonna miss you too.
Hm.

Don't let those guys
give you a hard time.

those boys.

Yeah, I have a feeling you can.

Any update from Langley
on my drone missile theory?


[indistinct whispering]

I'm coming in with Abby now.


[upbeat music playing]

Right, so, uh,
no actual emergency.

Well, apart from all
the normal emergencies,

safety of the free world,
all that stuff.

[Wesley] Tada!
Whoa.

What is that?
That is a work of art.

It is the Capitol Building
in DC, of course.

Obviously.

Yeah, obviously
it's the Capitol Building.

[men laughing]
Oh-ho-ho!

Hey, hey, cut the guy
some slack.

You put a trained killer
on a baking assignment.,

you get what you pay for.
[all laughing]


Thank you,
it's a very sweet gesture.

Enjoy the cake.

[indistinct chattering]

Did you have something
to do with this?

Hey, the guys wanted to give you
some kind of...

No, I'm talking about
sending me back to Washington.

Hey, of course not.

Come on Abby, you know me
better than that.

You're my right arm.

I tried to get you more time,
there was nothing I could do.

You know I'm not done here yet.

Hey.

I gotcha this.
Oh, my...

Wait, this isn't...

This is the bottle...
Yeah.

...that Ryan and I gave you.
Yeah, it is.

[both laugh]

You know, I'm not much of...
I know, big drinker.

Yeah.

Thank you.

This means a lot.

I'm gonna finish my rounds.

Anyone touches this...

Mia.
Mm-mm.

Be hell to pay.

She say Hatchet?

Get Abby on intercom.

Watchman two,
report to Big Dog's office.

We just got a call
from Special OPS.

They're bringing in Hatchet.

How do you know it's him?

We don't even
know what he looks like.

He fits the profile exactly
and they found him in Ankara,

<i>just like you said they would.
Arriving in two hours.</i>

We got him Abby.

shoot some pool?

Old Testament against New?

You want to get crucified again?

Put 50 bucks on it.
Okay, okay.

A Chaplain, risking
God's wrath by gambling.


let's see if you can

Lord's on my side, brother.
Lord's on my side.

[Uri] Can you move please?
It's cool, I'm just,

you know... it's all right.
[Uri] thank you.


Wow, that was
hard to miss that pocket.

You're shootin' like a grandma.

You okay Abby?

Hatchet's been captured.

They're transferring him here.

â™ª â™ª

Abby, can we talk?

Uri.

Let's me interview Farhan
just once.

He will listen to me.

Uri, you know I can't do that.

to you? You're leaving.

You have to
give me access to him.

I have responsibilities here.
Yeah, well we all do.

Look.

I get it. You want to
take down the people

who have taken so much from you.

I want to protect
those who are still alive.

Farhan Barakat is
up to his neck in this.

Give me the raw intel,
I have people on the ground

who an investigate it.

No.

And to be honest, I don't like
the way Mossad investigates.

though, no?

Let's help each other.

This is a Five Eyes site and
your country is not invited.

You got a problem with that,

take it up with your pal,
Rashid.

He's the head
of operations, not me.

any details</i>

<i>about the hospital bombing.</i>

We've been over this many times.

How many times?

That company you told us about,

Kyzaghan Enterprises in Ankara?

Hatchet's been captured there.

[chuckles darkly]
You better hope it isn't him.


That they are not
bringing him here right now.

You know, the first
time I heard of Hatchet,

these three station agents
turned up dead

in a safe house in Dushanbe.

They all had
their faces peeled back.

And they know it's him?


this particular kind
of fish skinning knife

to erase
the identity of his victims.

Handmade in Sochi.

And supposedly
the blade has a...

signature, you know,
like a gun barrel.

In Mossad we tracked him
for a while

when he was working for
the Revolutionary Guards

in Iran.

Then he switched to the Saudis,
then switched to the Libyans.

He's a disloyal shadow.

Sure knows how to pick
his employers.

You know, in, uh, Hebrew,
we call him the Shedim.

Demon.

They say after
the [indistinct] massacre

there was no running water,
so...

he bathed in the blood
of his victims.

No, this guy sounds like
a fairy tale,

campfire ghost story.

You'd be the expert on
that shit right, Chaplain?

[helicopter blades whirring]

â™ª â™ª

ETA?

[woman on comms]
<i>Touchdown in 10 clicks.</i>

Delta to Citadel,
10 clicks away.

[Hatchet gagging]

you piece of shit.

HQ, I received a directive.

I'll make sure it's done.

â™ª â™ª

Yankee-Juliet-77-Delta,
what is your direction and ETA?

[woman on radio]
<i>Exfil, 32 miles north, 0400.</i>

Drawbridge will be lowered,

<i>Please report to loading dock

<i>I repeat, security team Alpha

Yeah man, I'd love some.

â™ª â™ª

[Mia over speakers]
<i>Attention all personnel.</i>

<i>We have a high priority

we got the guy.

we never know, right?

this time or me?

I dealt with the last one,

you can deal with
this sticky bastard.

[Wesley chuckles] You're scared.
That's okay. We all get scared.

[woman on radio] <i>Package hot.</i>

[woman speaking indistinctly]

Seriously, what are the chances?

Three days before you ship out?

Someone's looking out for you.

Seems like it.

[Mia over speakers]
<i>Asset incoming.</i>

Hey. You got this.

â™ª â™ª


if it isn't Delta.

Hey boys, welcome.

Captain David Palau.

Rashid Nassar, head of
operations.

This is Abby Trent, CIA psyops,

second in command, she'll be
conducting the interrogation.

This is Tessa Harijan,
my translator.

Hi.
How you doing?

[Tessa] Hey, Abby.
[Abby] Tessa.

You know each other?
Yes, CR training at Quantico

a million years ago.

Good job with
the intel on Hatchet.

Actually it was all Abby's work.

Well done.
Thank you.

Can I talk to you for a minute?


You might want
to take a look at that.


What's that about?

No idea, they told me nothing.

Subject for interrogation
could speak Russian,

Arabic or Farsi, so...

What am I looking at here?

Who's authorized this?

These orders are written and
approved by Langley.

This is unbelievable.

I can't approve this.

We're authorized
to handle the asset here.

We have national security...
What is this place anyway?

[Rashid] Direct violation...
Uh, undisclosed, friendly.

Right, well it's three hours by
chopper from Ankara, so Jordan.

international responsibilities.

I like what you've done
with the place.

How long you been here?

10 months.
10 months?

Take your 40 minutes.
Wise choice.

[Rashid] Abby, need a word.
I could not handle that.

I like the simplicity of it.


What's going on?

Captain Palau asked for 45
minutes alone with the prisoner.

No video, no recording.
What, are you kidding me?

You told him no, right?

He has a written order
from Langley. My hands are tied.

That's bullshit, Rashid.

There's nothing I can do.

Bullshit,
there's nothing you can do.

That is the world's most
dangerous man

and no one knows more
about him than I do.

I need to be in that room.

An order is an order.
It's up to the powers that be,

not me.

Fuck the powers that be.

It's out of my hands.

here's your castle.

[AI voice on speaker]
<i>Access interrogation room one.</i>

<i>Security team Alpha.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[Mia whispers] <i>Delta.</i>

Spread 'em. Spread 'em.

Cut sound and video
to the interrogation room

from now until 0045 hours.

No permanent record,
no remote access

by anyone
from anywhere on the base.

But that's breaking protocol.

the order.

Just do it.
Okay.

â™ª â™ª

Hatchet.

Captain's gonna take
real good care of you.

There's a bonus prize
for you, kiddo.

Yeah, you just won the big one.

There you go,
nice and tight, boy.

You want a
face covering, Captain?

This guy's never gonna
see the light of day again.

Hey. You can go now,
we got this.


Right this way, kiddo.

Bye-bye.

What's going on here, huh?

These guys are fucking cowboys.


He's all yours.
[Palau] Okay.

[sucks teeth]

You got a handsome face,
anyone tell you?

The grey just, perfect.
Suits you.

Hey, you know,
you're not what I expected.

But then again,
no one really knows

where you're from or who you
really work for, right?

[Tessa speaking Turkish]

[Palau] FSB.
[Tessa] FSB.

[Palau] The Syrians.
[Tessa speaks Turkish]

[Palau speaks indistinctly]
[Tessa repeats Palau]

you wanna pick a fucking team?

[Palau chuckles]
[Tessa speaks Turkish]

[both grunt]

[Hatchet groaning, coughing]

I buried friends because of you.
So where do you want it?

Huh? You probably think you know
how this is going down, right?

I ask a few questions,
you stonewall.

I finally give up
and hand you back, but

that's not
what's happening here.

I got 40 minutes to
make things nice and personal.

Just you and me. So.

Let's get the party started.

Are you the operative
known as Hatchet? Hm?

Ask him in Farsi.
Or Russian or Arabic.

[Tessa speaking Farsi]


[Tessa speaking Farsi]

I'm finding this
kind of frustrating.

[both grunt]

That hurt a little bit?

It's okay. Who ordered
the bombing in Istanbul?

[Tessa speaking Farsi]


Was it the field agents
in Al-Tanf?

Huh?
[Tessa speaking Farsi]

Come on, Hatchy-Hatch, talk.

A confession would be nice.

But you say nothing,
it's the same thing in my book.

[Tessa speaking Farsi]

Okay.

Your choice. Hang him up.

â™ª â™ª

We brought
our toy bag right, Garcia?



[Hatchet gagging]

Mm-hm?

How's that, Hatchet? Huh?

You like that?

Good.

That's good.

Mm-hm? We talking? Hm, talking?

Okay. Okay, Hatchy.

Good work.

Talk to me.

Who ordered
the bombing of the hospital?

[Tessa speaking Farsi]
[Palau] Come on, talk to me.

No, no, no, no. To me.

I'm the one who decides
whether you live or die.

All right? There's a lot of
sensitive intel,

we're a remote base
in a foreign country.

And you say Mossad
are the hardliners.

You're the ones
taking out your own base.


[indistinct shouting]

back in your cell.

In your fucking hole.


What'd I fucking say, huh?
Stay in your fucking box.

Moving up.
Back up, back up.

[all grunting]


Two secure.


Don't fucking think about it.

Get the fuck back in there!

Get the fuck in there!

Four is clear!

Oh, no, you don't.
Don't you fucking try it.

On the fucking ground!
Stay on the fucking ground!

[electricity buzzing]


Who turned off
the fucking lights?

man. Calm the fuck down.

[Wesley] B side are clear.
[Jordan] Clear, all good.

Don't move.


[speaking foreign language]

motherfucker,

I'll put a hole in you,
I swear to God.

I'll put a fucking hole in you,

I swear to God.
[screams]

[prisoner shouts]

That's right, motherfuckers!

Fuck. Back in your cell!

Get back in your cell,
motherfucker!

[indistinct shouting]



â™ª â™ª

In your cell!

Get back in your cell!
I will shoot! I will shoot!

[both grunting]

what are you doing?

[prisoner] No more, no more!
[Wesley] Look Akim,

I don't wanna hurt you, okay?

Just relax, mate, and stay down!

my friend, no more, no more.

Please, please.

â™ª â™ª

[prisoner 2] Let us out,
hey, hey, hey!

Hey, come on, man,

we can help, let us out!

[prisoner 4] Hey!

Jordan?

Jord... Jordan!
Jordan, hey, hey, Jordan.

Jordan. Jordan!

Ah, fuck. Fuck.

â™ª â™ª

Tessa, level three.

Miller! Wesley!

I'll check Bravo.
Okay.

[prisoner 2] Let us out, man!
[indistinct shouting]


Yeah, don't ask.

Did you see Hatchet with Farhan?

I thought she was dead.

Apparently not.

[man groaning]
[door opens]

Wesley.
[whispers] Jordan.

[yelps]
It's just me.

What does Hatchet want with you?

I'm not giving you
anymore than I have already.

Quit fucking playing games and
tell her what she needs to know.

What will you do to me, huh?

I'm already dead.

I knew we should have
boarded this goat-fucker.


You.

You were held on base
at Al-Tanf for a month.

After your transfer, five dead
field agents turned up in Syria.

Now I know
he is looking for you.

My question is this.

Is he here to save you
or kill you?

Please ask him for
me when you find him.

Or he finds you.



Fuck!

I'm putting you in
charge of Watchtower.

I need eyes and comms.

Where are you going?
Server room.

â™ª â™ª

[AI voice] <i>Countdown,
45 minutes remaining.</i>

<i>Password affirmative,
Officer Uri Wasserman.</i>

Chaplain? What are you doing?


Damn lockdown.

[Uri mutters indistinctly]

Abby. There's no sign of him.
There are lots of blind spots.

<i>This place is a fucking maze.
I'll check the camera logs.</i>


Uri, you got eyes on us yet?

on level four is down.</i>

[Uri speaking indistinctly,
radio breaking up]

Uri.

[Abby speaking indistinctly,
radio breaking up]

I can't. I can't hear you, Abby.

We might lose radio contact,
it's patchy down here.

So this is the server room?

Citadel's black box. It's
where we store all the intel.

Hatchet would try
to target here.

[AI voice] <i>Officer Trent.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Quite the setup you got here.
[Abby] Every backup since

this place was built
10 years ago lives here.

Every part of
the interrogation program.

As well as all of my work
on the hospital bombing.

[computer alarm beeping]
[AI voice] <i>Security breach.</i>

Going through the camera logs.</i>

Oh shit, someone's tried to
access the server from offsite.

â™ª â™ª

Fuck.

Abby, come in. Abby!

[Uri on radio] <i>Abby,
get the fuck out of there!</i>

<i>Tessa killed Mia.
Repeat, Tessa killed Mia.</i>

[gun cocks]

didn't want to have to do this.

[both grunting]

â™ª â™ª


Let me access server
and erase a few files.

I don't want
to have to kill you.

We're still on the same side.


â™ª â™ª



What the fuck
happened to the translator?

We had a falling out.

What are you doing?

She's a traitor.

She killed Mia

and she put a gun to my head.
[Wesley] Jesus.

She working for Hatchet?

Or whoever Hatchet's
working for.

I thought she was your friend.
Yeah, me too.

Well, are you gonna tell us
what really happened down there?

I'm not sure what the fuck
you're implying, Miller.

I'm not implying anything.
I'm asking a question.


Hunker down, wait for
the next supply delivery?

That's not an option.
Why not?

Once we declare security breach,
if HQ can't establish

comms within one hour,
we're deemed compromised

and they hit the kill switch.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck
do you mean by kill switch?

A drone erases this place
and everything in it.

No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, fuck that.

Fuck that!
Okay, I say we cut our losses.

We get rid of the detainees.
We blow the fucking doors.

What, no? And... and Hatchet
goes free?

No, he's mine.

I don't give a fuck
about Hatchet.

You're gonna watch Tessa
and make sure

nothing happens to her.

You are gonna
keep an eye on him.

Wesley and I are gonna arm up.

that's your plan? [chuckles]

Yes, that's my plan, Miller,
and you better stay focused,

'cause if he comes back
for Farhan or Tessa,

you're the best chance we've got
of getting the drop on him.

Oh, I appreciate the show of
confidence, but just a reminder.

The score so far is five dead
on our side, none on his,

and that's 'cause fucking
analysts are calling the shots.

Not active duty servicemen.

Former active duty.

You gave up your army rank

when you joined here
as a private contractor.

Live with it.

I'll be in the armoury.

Come on, Wesley,
let's grab the C4

so we can blow our way
out of here.

[sighs angrily]

Yeah.

â™ª â™ª

[keypad beeping]

[keypad beeping]

[AI voice] <i>Armoury doors

Whoa, whoa, hey!
Jesus, Chaplain.

What are you doing?
I don't... I...

I was in my quarters
when the alarm went off.

We're in lockdown.

Come with us to the armoury.
Okay.

let's grab all the C4

and after we stock up
on weapons,

we're gonna have to
clear every room,

every hallway, together.
[Wesley] Okay.

The hell's going on up there?
Some new clusterfuck.

We need to know
what the translator is hiding.

Officer Trent said...
I don't give fuck

what Officer Trent said, okay?

I got one rule
when it comes to this shit,

that's stay alive, motherfucker.

I don't know about you,
but I didn't sign up

for no suicide mission.

Look, I guarantee you
they've got an exfil plan.

She's got to be in on it.

Okay.

[all coughing]

[Wesley] Fuck.
[Chaplain] God damn it,

he just tried to kill us.


[upbeat music playing
over speakers]

He's fucking with us.

[Chaplain mutters indistinctly]

Fuck. I mean, Jesus. Christ.

Fuck.
[Wesley] You all right there?

[Chaplain groans]


Where am I?

Oh, you're in Hell.

I don't know what Abby told you.

She's lost her mind.

Yeah, you wouldn't be
the first to suggest it but,

I'm gonna have to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

[music continues playing]
[Chaplain] Christ.

Chaplain,
you gotta keep up with us.

What now... now I think I lost
a bit of my hearing, Abby.

Yeah, you'll lose more than that

if you don't
stay on your toes, mate.

Cover us.

[music continues]

[music stops]

[explosion rumbling]


No, no, oh God, please, God, no.

Release him
or I'll show you both!

No, no, no, no. Just wait,
wait one second, wait.

Let him go, let him go now!

[gunshot]
No! No!

[gunshots]
[Chaplain screaming]


â™ª â™ª

[Chaplain screaming in distance]

I can get up.


Abby. Ab... [groans]


Abby. [stammering]

â™ª â™ª

You and me...
[Tessa grunts]

You and me are gonna
play a little game.

Okay? And the game is called

"you tell me
how you'd get out of here,

or I'll break
your fucking hand."

All right? You like games?
It's real simple.

See it goes like this.
[Tessa shouts]

I say, "How would you
get out of here?"

And if you answer correct...
[Tessa whimpers]

...I give you a prize,

and if you answer wrong,
I break your fucking hand.

Mm-mm.
[Miller] Yeah. Just like this.

[bones crack]
[screams]


Should we try little guy? Huh?

[Tessa] No! No! No!
This little pretty one here?

[Tessa] No, no!
[Miller] Should we try

this little pretty one here?
[Tessa] Stop!


is tell me how you'd
get out of here. No?

No?
[Tessa screams]

What's your exit strategy?

What's your fucking
exit strategy? No?

Now we're going for number four!

[bone cracks]
[Tessa screams]

Uri. Hatchet has Chaplain.

<i>Last seen
leaving the rec room.</i>

<i>And Wesley's gone.</i>


They're on level two.
Moving south in your direction.

Shit, just lost them again.

[AI voice]

Oh, no. No, no, no.

Come on, come on.
Where are you, you Shedim?

Crew quarters.

â™ª â™ª

[computer beeps]

<i>Sorry, Abby,
I've lost vision again.</i>

<i>I last saw him
at crew quarters.</i>

<i>I'll try and get system

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Uri. He's not here,
talk to me.

<i>Hatchet's on the move.</i>

<i>No Chaplain.</i>

He's been in my room.

<i>Think it's our best shot.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

Hey, you're falling asleep
on me.

Don't fall asleep, baby,
you're gonna miss the best part.


Now we gotta start
on the other side.

[Tessa screaming]
Okay! Okay, okay.

[Tessa] Stop! I'll talk!
Okay, okay. [shushing]

I'm listening.

You want Hatchet to leave?

Just get him Farhan.

That's all he's here for.

No shit, huh?

I knew that bastard
was withholding.

What does he want with Farhan?

You really have no idea. Do you?

â™ª â™ª

You're just a contractor.

We're pretty similar, you know.

Well.

I hope they paid you up front,

'cause you sure as shit
ain't getting a success B.

[Tessa grunting]

[Tessa screaming]

Fuck.

Any luck on comms?

I'm working on it.

We're going to need to patch
directly into the comms tower.

Might seem dodgy, should work.


<i>I can't figure out how
the hell Hatcher got to Tessa.</i>

Abby.
Miller is in Farhan's cell.

C'mon, buddy.

You and I are going
for a little walk.

Oh, fuck! Miller!
What's going on?


[Farhan grunts]
[Tessa] Abby?

What the hell did you do to her?

[gunshot]
[Abby gasping]

We had a conversation, she told
me everything I need to know.

We don't have time.
I need to take action.

She was a prime asset.

It doesn't matter anymore.
It's us or them.

I'm in charge now.

Give me your weapons.

That's not going to happen.

All we need to do
is deliver Farhan

to Hatchet.

Once he gets
what he came here for,

he's gone.

And I, for one, will be
right behind the motherfucker.

You can't just release him
into the wild.

That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

Briggs, take her sidearm.


This is mutiny.

â™ª â™ª

I'm sorry, Abby.


It's called doing what it takes.

you fuck.

Your intercoms, hand 'em over.

you're going to bargain

with a fucking psychopath?

This is for your own good, okay?

You'll thank me eventually.

â™ª â™ª

You... [grunts]

If all Hatchet wanted was
Farhan, he would've taken him.

This situation is way more

complex than you realize.
You ready?


Let's go.
[Abby] Miller!

Think about it!
Something else is going on here.

Come on, buddy.
[Abby] Miller, stop!

We're off to see the wizard.

with Hatchet!


Fuck!

Hatchet!

It's your lucky day.

I brought your guy.

Look, it's a simple trade, man.

No tricks.

You take Farhan,

we all get the fuck out of here.

â™ª â™ª

Abby, are you there?

I think I have a solution.

Half a solution.

What the fuck?


If you don't want him,

I'm happy to waste him
right now.

We doing this?

Uri?

[keys jingling]

[Uri] Sorry, Abby.
Oh, fuck.

What's happened to you?

Raymond's gone rogue.
He took Farhan..

I'll kill him.

We need comms.
Time's running out.

to hack something together.


â™ª â™ª

with the satellite.

Nice.

But you still need to
wire directly

to the cliff face antenna
before you make the call, okay?

Let's go.

What did you tell 'em about me?


[speaks Arabic]

Good. Good.

That's all I needed to know.

[knife slices]
[Farhan grunts]

[speaks Arabic]

[body thuds]

â™ª â™ª


Oh, fuck.

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. [shouts]

You noticing a pattern here?

He's tying up loose ends.

Yeah, and I think I know why.

I know I said
I wanted him alive.

I'm giving you the okay
to shoot on sight.

â™ª â™ª

Fuck.

Let's get to the loading dock.
It's our only way out.

â™ª â™ª

[keypad beeps]
[Hatchet] Come on, come on.

come on.


Okay, I'll head
for the radio antenna.

Remember, wire
directly to the terminals.

Best [indistinct].
We should get a signal.

What if I can't
call off the strike?

Everything has a price.

And if I go,
I'll take him down with me.

I'll get to the comms.

â™ª â™ª

[elevator whirring]

â™ª â™ª

[muttering prayer]

Shh.

Put this on. Go on.

â™ª â™ª

And this.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Put it on.

Coming up, come on, up.

When that door opens, you run
as if your life depends upon it,

you got that? Okay?

Good luck.

[both grunting]


[gunshot]
[shell clatters]

Hatchet down.

I got him.

You are no, demon, are you?
You're just a man.

Uri.

Uri?

â™ª â™ª

Show me your hands.

Slowly.

Put down the C4 and step away.

Easy...
Put it down!

Easy.

Nice and easy.

Stop moving.
Stop moving.

[gunshot]
[Hatchet groans]

I said stop moving.

The only thing that got me
through this past year

was knowing that I was going
to be the one to find you.

That I would get all the answers

to the questions
that keep gnawing at me.

Farhan, he was set up
so that I'd bring you in here.

It was a drone strike,
wasn't it?

The hospital bombing.

My husband.
My little girl.

186 people died that day

because someone at the CIA
ordered a drone strike.

And I don't know
if it was intentional,

but Silas sent you in
to cover it up.

It was... it was a mistake to
assign you to this case, Abby.

Your report started
the whole fucking thing.

Working out it was a drone
and not a bomb.

You're actually
a very good analyst, Abby.

We clearly didn't fucking
count on you uncovering this.

Is that where you come in?

To take me, my sources,
and all the intel out?

What can I say?

Hey, the agency
assigns you your cases,

they assigned me mine.

You were ordered to murder
a base full of people?

You're fucking out of your mind!

And it's gonna end right here.

Then what?

Huh? You think I'm the only...
the only Hatchet? Huh?

There were others fucking
before me,

there'll be many others after.

And all that evidence
you're gathering,

safely stored downstairs...

Hey, you're old friend Tessa,

she's takin'
care of that right about...

[beeping]
[Hatchet] <i>...now.</i>

<i>It's over, all right?</i>

Yeah? None of it
fucking matters.

So just, I'll get Silas
to go along with our story,

we'll be each others witness.

All right, come on.

You're not a killer.

We're on the same team.
Right.

each other home.

[gunshot]
[Hatchet shouts]

I've spent every hour
of every day wondering

what happened to them
at the end,

and now you're fucking
gonna find out.

You think you can... you think
you can just walk away?

Huh? There's nowhere
you can run,

there's nowhere
you can fucking hide!

They'll find you!

I'm not gonna hide.
[Hatchet] Silas, you, me.

I'm going to find them first.
[Hatchet] We're all the same,

we followed orders!

I won't die today!

I won't fucking die!

I am death, you hear me?
