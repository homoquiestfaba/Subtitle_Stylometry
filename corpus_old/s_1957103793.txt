IT'S COCAINE.
HELL, YEAH.

AN ORGANIZED CRIME HIT.

I MEAN, NOBODY ELSE IS GONNA

SOMEBODY'S MAKING A STATEMENT.

[car engine rumbling]

[screaming]
MOTHERFUCK--

SO WHAT, MOTHERFUCKER?

PICK YOUR FEET?

FRENCH CONNECTION.

I DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT
NO FRENCH FUCKIN' NOTHIN', MAN.

WHAT THE FUCK YOU GOT IN HERE?
HOLD STILL.

OH, FUCK.
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS SHIT?

I CAN'T FUCKIN' TELL YOU THAT,
AND YOU FUCKIN' KNOW IT.

BESIDES, YOU FUCKIN' SHOT ME.
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

YOU TELL ME
WHERE YOU GOT THIS SHIT,

AND YOU GET TO WALK
FUCKIN' FREE.

HE CAN DO THAT?

HE CAN DO
WHATEVER THE FUCK HE WANTS.

YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME
TO THE FUCKIN' DOCTOR FIRST?

AIN'T PART
OF THE FUCKIN' DEAL.

LISTEN TO THE FUCKIN' OLD MAN
BEFORE YOU END UP

IN THE SHOWER
WITH SOME HAIRY MOTHERFUCKER

SOAPIN' YOUR ASS.

LET HIM GO.

HE FUCKING LET HIM GO.

WE'VE BEEN TRACKING THAT FUCK
FOR WEEKS, AND HE LET HIM GO.

CALM DOWN, BRO.
FUCKER HAD A GUN, COFFEY.

MARINO CAUGHT HIM,
AND HE WAS SHITTIN' HIS PANTS.

BESIDES, HE'S GOT
HIS FUCKIN' PINKIE BLOWN OFF.

WHAT THE DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING, ANDRE?

MARINO, WHO WERE YOU
YESTERDAY, HUH?

RAMBO, DIRTY HARRY,
"POPEYE" DOYLE?

YOU WERE THERE, RHODES.
WHICH ONE WAS IT?

JACK, LET IT GO, MAN.
IT WAS A BAD CALL, OLD MAN.

JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE
HIS OWN PEOPLE GET TO HIM.

SAVE THE TAXPAYERS SOME MONEY.

LOOK, I'M A HUNTER,
NOT A FISHERMAN.

THIS CATCH-AND-RELEASE SHIT'S
GOT TO GO.

YOU GUYS WANT TO KEEP--
ENOUGH.

WHAT DO WE GOT?

WELL, THE INITIAL LAB REPORTS
SAY THIS SHIT

MILO'S BEEN PEDDLING'S
THE BEST WE'VE SEEN IN YEARS.

IT'S COMPLETELY UNCUT.

MILO ALSO GAVE US A LUKE
WITHOUT A LAST NAME.

APPARENTLY,
THIS GUY'S A BARTENDER

AT SOME CLUB UP IN HOLLYWOOD.

IT'S CALLED ATTITUDE.

CAT NAMED ERIC CARTER'S
HALF OWNER.

CARTER ALSO PLAYED
MIDDLE LINEBACKER

FOR THE 49ERS
BEFORE HE BLEW OUT HIS KNEE.

HE WAS BORN IN COMPTON
IN 1967.

GOT A COUPLE OF PRIORS
AS A TEENAGER--

YOU KNOW, PETTY THEFT
AND MARIJUANA--

BUT NOTHING SINCE.

HE LIVES ON SUNSET PLAZA
IN LOS ANGELES.

HE WAS DIVORCED TWICE,
WITH TWO GROWN KIDS,

AND DMV SHOWS HE DRIVES
AN '09 BLACK MERCEDES.

DAMN, D.P., YOU EVEN GOT
HIS MATING HABITS DOWN.

THAT'S WHAT I DO.
I LIKE THAT.

SO WE GOT MILO GETTING COKE
FROM A GUY NAMED LUKE

WITH NO LAST NAME?

LET'S TALK TO LUKE.

LIKE GINO SAID,

BEST POWDER WE'VE SEEN IN YEARS,

AND THE OLD MAN
MADE THE RIGHT CALL.

IMAGINE THAT.

YO!

HOW YOU DOIN', MAN?

WHAT'S UP, HOMES?
HOW YOU DOIN', MAN?

GOOD TO SEE YOU, B.

I AIN'T GOT SHIT ON ME.

HEY, HEY, HEY,
SLOW DOWN.

WHERE YOU GOIN'?
COME BACK HERE.

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOIN'?
HAVING A NICE DAY?

GET YOUR ASS
AGAINST THE WALL.

HEY, MAN, I TOLD YOU
I AIN'T GOT SHIT ON ME, MAN.

I'M FUCKIN' CLEAN, DUDE.

OH, YOU'RE CLEAN NOW.

YOU'RE CLEAN.
ARE YOU SURE?

YOU GUYS CAN'T BE DOIN'
THIS KIND OF SHIT.

ENRIQUE MARTINEZ, HUH?
YOU GOT SOME I.D.?

NO.
NO? NO I.D.?

THEY NEVER HAVE I.D., HUH?

HEY, DON'T FUCK WITH ME,
OSCAR.

A'IGHT, A'IGHT, A'IGHT,
FUCK, MAN.

TAKE EVERYTHING
SO FUCKIN' SERIOUS.

WELL, FUCKIN' START TALKING.

CARLOS, IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

IPOD?
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE AN IPOD?

NO.

SO WHEN I GET IT,
Y'ALL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.

A'IGHT?

A'IGHT.

COOL.

A'IGHT, MAN.

MAN, YOU GUYS HAVE
A GOOD DAY, MAN.

THANK YOU, MAN.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

FUCKIN' CROOKED-ASS COP.

YOU HEARD ABOUT MILO?
NO.

NO, YOU DON'T KNOW A MILO,
HUH, GUYS?

PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE CAR.

WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR STUFF?

[electronic dance music]

*

HERE YOU GO.

CAN I GET YOU SOMETHIN'?
I'M GOOD, THANKS.

YOU SURE?
YEAH.

HEY, MAN,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

WHAT'S UP?

MILO SAYS YOU HAVE
THE HOOKUP AROUND HERE.

I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
NAMED MILO.

LOOK, GUYS, YOU KNOW,

I'M A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW,
SO...

I THINK
YOU OUGHT TO STICK AROUND, MAN.

YOU MUST KNOW HIM.
HE DESCRIBED YOU TO A "T."

REALLY?

LIKE I SAID, GUYS,
I'M WORKIN'.

HIS NAME'S ROCKSIE.

BLOOD DRAINED OUT HIS ASS
WHEN I MENTIONED

THAT MILO PIECE OF SHIT.

SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

I SAY LET HIM SWEAT IT OUT,

PAY HIM ANOTHER VISIT
IN A COUPLE DAYS.

THAT'S ERIC CARTER.
HE OWNS THE CLUB.

YOUR MONEY'S NOT GOOD HERE.
I GOT THIS, BABY. I GOT THIS.

HE'S GOT THIS.
PUT YOUR MONEY AWAY.

YOU MAKE THE BIG SPENDER?

I'VE SEEN HIM IN HERE BEFORE.

THE LITTLE SEXY MAMA BESIDE HIM,
THAT'S HIS SISTER.

THE DUDE WITH THE CHICK
IN HIS LAP,

THAT'S THE YOUNGER BROTHER.

BOTH OF 'EM
LIVING THE HIGH LIFE.

HEY, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

[engine rumbling]

[engine revving]

[suspenseful music]

*

[speaking Spanish]

IT'S TOO MANY FOR ME.

[speaking Spanish]

OYE, MAN, YOU SAVING ANY
OF THOSE YOUNG LADIES FOR ME?

I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

I MAY HAVE WORN THEM OUT.

[chuckles]

[both speaking Spanish]

AND WHO IS YOUR FRIEND?

THIS IS JADE.
JADE?

YEAH, SHE HAS
A LOT OF IMPORTANT FRIENDS

FOR YOU TO MEET, SO WE HAVE
SOME BUSINESS TO TAKE CARE OF.

[boat motor revving]

[snorts]


[all speaking Spanish]

DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

YUP.

YOU FUCKIN' TOLD ME.

ARE WE DONE HERE, GENTLEMEN?

WELL, I GOT A DECK
FULL OF LADIES,

AND I'M READY TO POP
SOME PIÃ‘ATAS.

SI, SEÃ‘OR.

LADIES,

COME ON DOWN HERE
AND SAY HI TO MY FRIENDS.

[women laughing]
YOU'RE CUTE.

CHICA, CHICA.
SO FUNNY.

[siren wailing]

HEY, WE GOT A LOCAL RESIDENT
THAT FOUND HIM.

THEY LEFT AT 2:09.

YEAH, BROKOWSKI AND YACONELLI
WERE JUST WITH THEM.

HEY, HOW YOU DOIN'?
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

FRANKIE.

MIKE, IT'S NASTY.

THIS IS MY LAST STIFF.

I'M PUTTIN' IN MY PAPERS.

LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

HIS THROAT WAS SLIT
FROM EAR TO EAR,

AND HE HAS A .45 ROUND
IN HIS FOREHEAD.

THAT'S LUKE ROCKSIE,
ALL RIGHT.

HE HAD A WALLET
IN HIS BACK POCKET,

CREDIT CARDS,
COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS,

AND A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

THIS IS NO ROBBERY.

WELL, YOU GUYS FOUND THE BODY.

YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

WE'LL HANDLE IT.

[doorbell rings]

[knock at door]

[scoffs]

THESE MOTHERFUCKERS.

ERIC CARTER.

YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

YEAH, WE KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS.
CAN WE COME IN?

DO I LOOK LIKE I'M COOKIN'
FUCKIN' OMELETS?

WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
ABOUT LUKE ROCKSIE?

WHO?

YOUR BARTENDER
AT THE ATTITUDE.

WHY YOU ASKIN' ABOUT LUKE?

HOW LONG HE WORK FOR YOU, MAN?

I DON'T KNOW.
TWO YEARS.

TWO YEARS,
THAT'S A LONG TIME.

HE MUST'VE BEEN
A GOOD EMPLOYEE.

YEAH, HE WAS.
WAS?

WAS, IS, SAME SHIT.

KNOW YOUR BOY WAS PUSHING
POWDER ROUND TOWN, RIGHT?

NAH, I WASN'T AWARE.

OH, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT, HUH?

NO, SEE,
I'M JUST A SIMPLE BUSINESSMAN.

YEAH, I USED
TO WATCH YOU PLAY, MAN.

BADDEST RUNNING BACK
IN THE LEAGUE.

YOU WANT A FUCKIN' AUTOGRAPH?
NOW, THAT'S FUNNY.

SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHERE YOUR BOY'S

GETTIN' HIS SHIT FROM,
SMART-ASS?

WHO?
LUKE. WHO DO YOU THINK?

HOW THE HELL
WOULD I KNOW THAT?

YOU KNOW HE'S DEAD, RIGHT?

SHIT, WHO'S DEAD?

YOUR EMPLOYEE LUKE.

DAMN, I KNOW HE DIDN'T COME IN
TO WORK A COUPLE NIGHTS.

EXACTLY, SO TELL ME WHERE YOUR
BOY'S GETTIN' HIS POWDER FROM.

FUCK IF I KNOW.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

HE SAID HE GOT HIS SHIT
FROM YOU, MAN.

WELL, THEN HE'S
A FUCKIN' LIAR.

YOU MIND IF I TAKE
A LOOK AROUND IN HERE?

HELL FUCKIN' YES, I MIND.
THAT'S MY BEDROOM.

CHILL THE FUCK OUT, BOY.

[mysterious music]

*

TELL ME ABOUT THE VEGA FAMILY.

WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?

YOU ARE IN MY SEAT.

YOU FUCKIN' DEAF?

DIEGO, GIVE ME A MOMENT
WITH THIS GENTLEMAN.

DIEGO.

WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK?

NO, I'M FINE.

HOW ABOUT YOU?
ANOTHER?

NO, I'M GOOD, BABE.
THANKS.

RIGHT ABOUT NOW,
I GUESS YOU'RE WONDERING,

"IS THIS GUY A COP?"

NO.

I ALREADY KNOW YOU'RE A COP.

THE QUESTION IS,
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

WELL, LET'S SAY THAT, UH,

I'M GONNA FIND OUT
EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW.

IS THAT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO?

PLAY THIS GAME?

YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.

I, UM--
I READ A DISTURBING STORY

THE OTHER DAY
ABOUT THAT CHIEF OF POLICE

DOWN IN FLORIDA,
THE ONE THAT WAS MURDERED.

I IMAGINE IT'S NOT UNUSUAL
FOR MEN IN YOUR LINE OF WORK

TO MEET THAT TYPE OF FATE,

BUT THE WAY
THEY DISMEMBERED HIM

AND THEN HAD THE HEAD
SENT TO HIS WIFE...

THE MESSAGE THAT THAT SENDS,

IT'S, UH, VERY PROFOUND.

YOU FINISHED?

I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
AN INTERESTING MESSAGE.

SO WHAT SORT OF MESSAGE
YOU TRYING TO SEND ME?

LIFE IS PRECIOUS,
MY FRIEND.

ONE SLIP
IS ALL IT'S GONNA TAKE.

ONE SLIP.

[both speaking Spanish]

[ominous music]

*

THE CONVERSATION WE'RE
ABOUT TO HAVE NEVER HAPPENED.

DO THEY EVER?

WE DO NOT INVOLVE OURSELVES
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

THEY'RE ON ANOTHER LEVEL.

WE'RE ON ANOTHER LEVEL.

WHAT ARE YOU SAYIN'?
THEY'RE PROTECTED?

DIVISION 123 WAS GROUPED
OUTSIDE THE FORCE, MIKE,

SO YOU COULD BEND THE RULES.

EXACTLY.

BUT YOU DON'T
BEND THE RULES, MIKE.

YOU BREAK THEM.
AND WE DON'T EXIST, REMEMBER?

I'VE WORKED DAMN HARD
TO EARN THE TITLE OF COMMANDER,

AND I WON'T PUT THAT ON THE LINE
FOR ANYBODY, MIKE,

INCLUDING YOU.

DOES THIS RING
OF PROTECTION

EXTEND DOWN
INTO THE DEPARTMENT?

I THINK I'M GONNA LET
THAT ONE SLIDE.

WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
I CAN TURN A BLIND EYE,

BUT I CAN ONLY TURN SO FAR.

HAVE YOU THOUGHT
FOR ONE MOMENT

THAT IF THIS THING
GOES AWRY,

YOU'D TAKE DOWN SEVEN GOOD COPS
WITH YOU?

WE DON'T WANT TO BE EXPOSED
LIKE THAT, MIKE.

RIGHT?

[sighs]

[melancholy music]

*

[both speaking Spanish]

DO YOU HAVE TO ASK?

HE HAS BROUGHT US
A LOT OF MONEY, CATALINA.

HE SOLD DRUGS
TO OUR EMPLOYEES.

NOW WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF BUSINESS.

[speaking Spanish]

BROTHER,
LET ME TAKE CARE OF HIM.

HI, BABY.

HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE ME?

OH, I LOVE YOU MADLY.

YOU KNOW I DO.

I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

ANYTHING?

ANYTHING.

[intense music]

*

I GOT THAT SIDE.
YOU GOT THIS SIDE.

YOU PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES.

[muffled speech]

GIVE ME THE WEST SIDE.


[glasses clinking]

[smooth jazz music]

THESE VEGAS ARE DIRTY.

THEY'RE ARROGANT.

THEY'RE INVOLVED.

HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

THIS BROAD AND HER BROTHERS,

THEY HAVE MORE MONEY
THAN DONALD TRUMP.

AND YOU THINK
CARTER'S INVOLVED.

A STRONG HUNCH.

I HAVE A STRONG HUNCH
MY WIFE IS FUCKIN' THE POOL GUY,

BUT I CAN'T DO SHIT
WITH THAT EITHER.

I GOT AN EX-FOOTBALL PLAYER
HOOKED UP WITH A QUEEN BEE.

I'D CALL IT A STRONG HUNCH.

YOU BUY INTO THIS?

INFORMANTS ARE RUNNIN' SCARED.

NOBODY'S TALKIN'.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

A SEARCH WARRANT.

SINCE WHEN DO YOU NEED
A SEARCH WARRANT?

JUST BUY A DISPOSABLE
CELL PHONE,

PUNCH AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER.

PRESTO, YOU HAVE
YOUR SEARCH WARRANT.

WOW, DID I SAY THAT?

YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE?

NOT THAT I EVER
TOLD YOU ABOUT.

[glass clinking]

TO AN EVERLASTING LIFE
TOGETHER.

TAKES ONE HEART
TO KEEP YOU ALIVE,

TWO HEARTS
TO KEEP YOU LIVIN'.

I LOVE YOU TWO
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MINE.

CHEERS.

THERE'S YOUR CHANGE.

THANKS, LADY.

THANKS FOR COMIN' UP,
CASSIDY.

NO PROBLEM.

SO BEFORE YOU,
THERE WAS THIS YOUNG COP

NAMED ERICA YAZ
WHO JOINED THE DIVISION.

SMART COP.

SHE WORKED FOR US
FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS.

WE DECIDED TO INFILTRATE HER

ON THIS BIG CASE
WE WERE WORKIN' ON.

SHE SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS
GETTIN' THIS GUY TO TRUST HER.

SHE EVEN TOLD ME
THAT SHE GOT HIM

TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER.

THEN ONE DAY,
WE GET A PHONE CALL.

THEY FOUND HER
HANGING FROM A FLAGPOLE

IN FRONT OF A SCHOOL.

IF YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT BRINGING ME IN,

I'LL DO IT.

HOW DO I KNOW
YOU CAN HANDLE IT?

I GOT NOTHING ELSE.

[foreboding music]

*

[car engine revving]

YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT
IF YOU WAKE UP EARLY ENOUGH,

YOU CAN SEE THE DOLPHINS
SWIMMING DOWN THE COAST.

REALLY?

REALLY.

DO YOU LIKE DOLPHINS?

COME IN.

HOW YOU DOING?

FINE, THANK YOU.

CAPTAIN MIKE MARINO.

ARI SOFFER.

LIEUTENANT WILSON.

NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

CATALINA VEGA.
SHE IN?

WE'RE HERE TO SPEAK TO YOU
A LITTLE BIT MORE

ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH ERIC CARTER.

THAT'S OVER.

I DON'T DEAL WITH PEOPLE
WHO SELL DRUGS

TO MY EMPLOYEES.

SO YOU TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT IT?

I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

I DON'T NEED ANYBODY IN MY LIFE

HAVING ANYTHING TO DO
WITH ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES,

SO I DUMPED HIM.

THAT'S A PRETTY COOL BAG
RIGHT THERE.

WHAT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT RUN?

10 GRAND,

BUT EVERYTHING'S NEGOTIABLE.

WHAT IS IT WITH YOU PEOPLE?

EVERYTHING'S NEGOTIABLE?

IF WE'RE THROUGH HERE,
GENTLEMEN,

I NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK.

IF YOU NEED INFORMATION,
WHY DON'T YOU ASK ERIC?

I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHERE HE IS?

[seedy music]

*

[siren wailing]

REPORTED THAT FIGHTING
HAS ESCALATED

BETWEEN THE MEXICAN ARMY
AND THE MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS.

MEXICAN OFFICIALS
DIEGO GARCIA AND CESAR CRUZ

HAVE REPORTEDLY STEPPED DOWN
FROM THEIR POSITIONS

AFTER TWO AMERICAN TOURISTS
WERE FOUND DECAPITATED.

THE BEHEADINGS ARE BELIEVED
TO BE CARTEL-RELATED.

GARCIA AND CRUZ
HAVE BOTH REFUSED TO COMMENT.

[ominous music]

BILLIE.

HI.
HI, THIS IS MIKE.

CAPTAIN MIKE MARINO.

OH, WELL,
DO I CALL YOU CAPTAIN,

OR DO I CALL YOU MIKE?

MIKE'S FINE.

WELL, IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU, MIKE.

UH, BODY WAS POSITIVELY I.D.'D
AS ERIC CARTER.

SOME FISHERMEN
CAUGHT HIM IN THEIR NET.

SO WHERE'S THE REST OF HIM?

HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
IN THE WATER.

WE'RE LUCKY WE HAVE THIS MUCH.

YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

I DIDN'T HAVE DINNER.

JUST DON'T GET THAT SHIT
ON MY TABLE.

OKAY, OKAY.

SO WHAT'S THE CAUSE OF DEATH?

A SINGLE ROUND
FROM A .357 MAGNUM

FIRED AT CLOSE RANGE

ENTERED THE OCCIPITAL LOBE

AND EXITED
THE TEMPORAL LOBE HERE.

BIT OF AN OVERKILL.

MIKE.

LOOK,

JEANNIE WAS YOUR WIFE,

BUT SHE WAS ALSO MY SISTER.

AND SHE WAS KILLED,
AND YOU GOT THE GUY THAT DID IT.

I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL YOU
HOW TO LIVE YOUR LIFE.

MAYBE WE JUST GOT TO MOVE ON.

Â¿QUE PASA?

DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU

THAT THE COPS ARE SITTING
OUTSIDE OUR HOUSE?

NO, THEY'VE BEEN OUT THERE
FOR HOURS.

DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD BE WISE

TO SEND A MESSAGE
TO MR. MARINO?


[cell phone ringing]

HELLO.

WHEN?

OKAY.

FUCK.

[eerie music]

IT'S BAD, MIKE.

[suspenseful music]

*

NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

[screaming]

[melancholy piano music]

*

[baby crying]

SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME WE RING
A DOORBELL, SOMEONE DIES.

WELL, SORRY
ABOUT YOUR COLLEAGUE.

THESE FOLKS
YOU'RE MESSING WITH,

THEY DON'T PLAY GAMES.

NO SHIT.
NOBODY'S TALKING.

LOOK, WE NEED SOME INFORMATION--

WELL, IT'S ALL-OUT WAR
WITH THESE DRUG CARTELS.

THERE ARE DEAD BODIES
ALL OVER THE STREETS.

ESTIMATED THAT 50% OF THE COPS
ARE ON THE TAKE.

WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS, WE HAVE
ENOUGH SHIT ON OUR PLATE.

WITHOUT MESSING
WITH YOUR SHIT.

I'LL HAVE A DIET SODA,
PLEASE.

I'LL GET YOU
THAT DIET SODA,

AND YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE
A BLOODY MARY.

YEAH, THANK YOU.

YOU ALONE?

OH, WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

I FEEL SAFE HERE.

THIS IS A COP HANGOUT,
ISN'T IT?

YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK,
DON'T YOU?

I HAVE MY SOURCES.

THAT COP HAD A NAME.

HE HAD A WIFE.

WHO'S PROTECTING YOU?

I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

YOU GOT BALLS COMING IN HERE.

WHAT DO YOU WANT, MICHAEL?

I WANT TO RID THE PLANET
OF SCUM LIKE YOU.

YOU'RE AN IDEALIST,

MICHAEL JOSEPH MARINO.

I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

I ALSO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE A VERY ANGRY MAN.

WELL, TODAY'S WORLD
IS NOT THE SAME WORLD

THAT YOU ONCE KNEW.

DEALS COULD BE MADE.

I COULD GIVE YOU EVERYTHING

THAT YOU COULD EVER WANT.

AS LONG AS IT TAKES,

MISS VEGA, CATALINA,

I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN.

I'M GONNA TAKE
YOUR BROTHERS DOWN.

AND I DON'T CARE
HOW LONG IT TAKES ME

UNTIL THEY PUT ME
SIX FEET UNDER.

YOU SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL

FOR WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

THIS IS FOR YOU.

IT'S A GIFT.

I KNOW YOU LIKED IT.

MAYBE YOU COULD FIND
SOME GOOD USE FOR IT.


GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

[thunder booming]

THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

IT'S ACROSS THE HALL.

THANK YOU.

TAKE A SEAT, MIKE.

I THINK YOU KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

I'M SURE YOU'RE
GONNA TELL ME WHY.

WE SEEM TO HAVE
A PROBLEM DEVELOPING.

YOU'RE BLAMING ME?
SHOULD I?

YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO GET IN YOUR WAY.

THEN DON'T.

LOOK, I KNOW THAT NONE OF US
ARE SUPPOSED TO KNOW

WHAT YOU AND YOUR DIVISION
ARE DOING.

HOW MANY DEAD BODIES
HAVE TO KEEP TURNING UP

BEFORE WE'RE ALLOWED
TO DO OUR JOB?

SO WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE

A FEW CRIMINALS
KILLING EACH OTHER

OR THOUSANDS OF KIDS
HOOKED ON DRUGS,

MURDERING LIQUOR STORE OWNERS
FOR A FIX?

AND THE DEAD COP,

WAS IT WORTH IT?

OTTO, WHAT THE HELL
YOU DOIN' HERE?

WE INVITED HIM.

JUST DOIN' MY JOB, MIKE.

WHAT JOB'S THAT?

[clears throat]

HITS WERE ALL DONE
WITH LARGE-CALIBER HANDGUNS.

ALL THE SHELL CASINGS
AT THE CRIME SCENES

MATCH THE GUN THAT WAS USED.

SO NOW YOU'RE ON THEIR SIDE.

COME ON,
THIS IS NOT ABOUT SIDES.

IT'S ABOUT US DOING OUR JOB
THE WAY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO.

I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.

HATE TO BE
IN YOUR SHOES, LOGAN.

[thunder booming]

[rain pattering]

[ominous music]

*

[enigmatic rock music]

*

[people screaming]

*

[cell phone ringing]

DO YOU MIND?

NOT A PROBLEM.

NO, I'M FINE.

YES, MOTHER.

ARE YOU FUCKIN' CRAZY?

DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME.

I MIGHT BE LATE TONIGHT.

THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT,
CASSIDY.

YOU KNOW IT.

I LOVE YOU.

[snorts]

BYE.

AH.

MY SISTER, CATALINA.

CATALINA, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO THIS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY,

MISS GINA HANSON.

SO VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU, GINA.

HA, MY BROTHER'S
NOT EXAGGERATING.

YOU ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL.

AND SO ARE YOU, CATALINA.

YOU HAVE AN AMAZING HOME.

MUST BE NICE TO LIVE
IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

THANK YOU.

WE ENJOY IT.

VERY NICE TO MEET YOU, GINA.

MY BROTHER
HAS EXCELLENT TASTE.

MY SISTER LIKES YOU.

I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU AND JEANNIE DID IT

ALL THOSE YEARS, MIKE.

SHE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

YEAH.

LOOK, THE GUYS UPSTAIRS
ARE GETTING ANXIOUS.

FUCK THOSE ASSHOLES.

DON'T SHOOT
THE MESSENGER, MIKE.

IT'S ABOUT
DISRUPT, DISMANTLE.

ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS SAID?

LOT OF DEAD BODIES, MIKE,

INCLUDING ONE OF OUR OWN.

I'VE GOT A COP ON THE INSIDE.

HER LIFE'S AT RISK.

I'M NOT WALKIN' AWAY
FROM THIS.

I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

I MEAN, HOW IS CASSIDY?
CAN SHE DO THIS?

LOOK, SHE LOST
HER LITTLE BROTHER

TO A DRUG OVERDOSE.

SHE'LL DO WHAT IT TAKES.

SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE ELSE I KNOW.

WE'RE NOT WALKIN' AWAY.

DID I SAY THAT?

HEY, LOGAN.

ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

JUST GET IT DONE, MIKE.

I NEED YOU TO GATHER
THAT INFORMATION.

YOU COULD DO THAT,
WE'LL BE GOOD.

[speaking indistinctly]

I DON'T KNOW.
YOU GOT THE FILE ON SAN PEDRO?

YEAH, I FOUND ONE.
SO YOUR CONTACT, ENRIQUE.

WE WILL CONTACT ENRIQUE.

MAYBE HE'S GOT SOME...

[bluesy rock music]

CALLED A KNIFE MAKER.

ROBERT LOVELESS?
YO!

ANTONIO VEGA.

YEAH.

OCTOBER 2007,

HE BOUGHT A NEW YORK SPECIAL.

I FINALLY DELIVERED IT TO HIM
AND GOT HIS MONEY.

AND HE WANTED TO ORDER
A COUPLE MORE.

I TOLD HIM NO,
I WOULDN'T TAKE ANY MORE ORDERS.

[airplane engines roaring]

[pulsing music]

* I SEE MY FUTURE

* IN THE EYES OF STRANGERS

* AND I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM

I'D LIKE TO GET ME
SOME OF THAT PUSSY.

[glass clattering]

* I SEE MY FUTURE

* IN THE EYES OF STRANGERS

* AND I DON'T KNOW

I APOLOGIZE.

I'M SORRY I MADE A FOOL
OUT OF MYSELF IN THERE.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
ALL RIGHT.

TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
ALL RIGHT.

WHO'S THE HICK
IN THE FUNNY SHIRT?

I DON'T KNOW,

BUT HOMEBOY'S LOADED.

HE WAS DROPPIN' CASH
LIKE PAC-MAN JONES

TILL HE GOT HIS NOSE
BUSTED OPEN.

YOU GUYS TAKE ROY ROGERS.

I'M GONNA STAY WITH CASSIDY.

[cell phone rings]

YEAH, DJ.

HEY, WE TAILIN'
THIS REDNECK HICK

WE SAW KICKIN' IT

LOOK LIKE THIS FOOL
HEADED TO BURBANK AIRPORT,

BUT, YO, DUDE WAS DROPPIN'
A LOT OF CASH AT THE CLUB.

CASSIDY WAS UP IN THERE TOO,

SWAPPIN' SPIT WITH STRIPPERS
AND SHIT,

AND OUT OF NOWHERE,
PRETTY BOY

JUST KNUCKLES THE HICK
LIKE DE LA HOYA IN THE FIFTH.

MUST'VE BEEN TALKIN' SHIT

ABOUT CASSIDY'S TIGHT ASS
OR SOMETHIN'.

BUT, YO, I WALK OUTSIDE, I SEE
THE SAME TWO CATS CHILLIN',

KICKIN' IT LIKE THEY PALS
AND SHIT.

ANDRE STAY WITH CASSIDY?

MAN, NOW, YOU KNOW ANDRE
STAY WITH CASSIDY.

SHE AIN'T GOING NOWHERE WITHOUT
HIM BREATHIN' UP HER ASS.

WELL, IF YOUR HICK
GETS ON A FLIGHT,

YOU GET YOUR ASS
ON THE SAME FLIGHT,

AND DON'T LET HIM
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

ALL RIGHT.

[both moaning]

FUCK.

WHAT THE FUCK, CATALINA?

[laughs]

OH, ANTONIO.

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU ENJOY MORE,

EITHER MAKING LOVE
TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

OR SLASHING YOUR KNIFE
INTO AN UGLY MAN.

I THINK WE COULD HAVE
SOME PRIVACY.

YOU CAN HAVE WHAT YOU LIKE.

YOU ALWAYS HAVE.

IS THAT RIGHT?

I CAN HAVE WHATEVER I WANT.

[laughs]

I HAVE A QUESTION,
LITTLE ONE.

DID MY BROTHER
MAKE YOU HAPPY?

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

SEX WITHOUT VIOLENCE...

IS MEDIOCRITY.

ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS.

I WILL.

[water pattering]

* YEAH, WE CAME HERE TO FIGHT
FOR ONE REASON *

* AND NOBODY IS LEAVIN'
TILL ONE OF US *

* STOPS SWINGIN'
OR SOMEBODY'S NOT BREATHIN' *

* WE'LL FIGHT JUST LIKE
A COUPLE WILD LIONS *

* IN THE JUNGLE

* SO LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE

* WE'LL FIGHT FOR ONE REASON

* AND NOBODY IS LEAVIN'

YO, COME ON.
HICK'S ON THE MOVE.

* WE'LL FIGHT JUST LIKE
A COUPLE WILD LIONS *

* IN THE JUNGLE

* SO LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE

HEY, MAN, I'M LOOKIN'
FOR SOMEBODY NAMED LOU.

WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

I'M COWBOY.

I'M TOLD MAYBE YOU, UH,

MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HOOK ME UP WITH, LIKE, A--

A MANNEQUIN-LIKE THING.

I'LL GIVE YOU 50 BUCKS
FOR THIS ONE.

50 BUCKS?

YOU CRAZY?
GO FUCK YOURSELF.

COME ON, LOU.
HEY, HEY, ALL RIGHT.

I'LL GIVE YOU 75 BUCKS
FOR THE LITTLE ONE.

NO, GO FUCK YOURSELF.

I'LL GIVE YOU 100 BUCKS.
THAT'S AS FAR AS I CAN GO.

* WE'LL FIGHT JUST LIKE
A COUPLE WILD LIONS *

* IN THE JUNGLE

* SO LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE

[driving rock music]

SO I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
MIGHT WANT TO KNOW

WHAT MY GIRLS OVERHEARD
LAST NIGHT.

I'M ALL EARS.

WELL, CHASTITY,

DANCING FOR A COUPLE OF GUYS,

COUPLE OF HEAVIES
ALL JACKED UP,

BIG DUDES,

SHE SAYS THEY START BRAGGIN',

TALKIN' ABOUT WHACKIN' COPS
AND SHIT.

DID SHE SAY WHICH ONES?

WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER?

SHE'S THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE,

DOIN' SHIT SHE AIN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING.

YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO HAVE ANY TAPE

WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT,
WOULD YOU?

OOH, I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT ASK THAT.

WELL, CHECK THIS OUT.

RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

YOU MIND IF I HAVE A FEW WORDS
WITH MISS CHASTITY?

BE MY GUEST.

SO THE COWBOY'S GOT A NAME.

IT'S RANDY PRICE.
HE'S FROM MEMPHIS.

THEY CALL HIM "THE HICK."

HE WAS PICKED UP ONCE
ON SUSPICION OF ARMED ROBBERY.

HE WAS TRYIN' TO HOLD UP
A COUPLE OF DRUG DEALERS,

BUT THEY LET HIM GO 'CAUSE
HE LED 'EM TO SOME DRUG DEALS

THEY WERE TRYIN' TO TAKE DOWN
FOR MONTHS.

SO WHAT IS
THE GOOD MAYOR ALVAREZ

DOING IN A PHOTO
WITH CATALINA VEGA?

WELL, HE'S GOT GOOD TASTE.

HIS WIFE LEFT HIM
'CAUSE HE WAS FUCKIN'

A 29-YEAR-OLD STRIPPER.

NOW WE KNOW HE WAS FUCKIN'
CATALINA VEGA.

SO THEN I'M WONDERIN'
WHAT THE GOOD MAYOR ALVAREZ

IS DOIN' HANGING
WITH THE VEGA FAMILY.

WHAT ABOUT THESE TWO GENTLEMEN

THAT WERE BRAGGIN'
ABOUT KILLIN' COPS?

BEEN ON THE VEGA PAYROLL
FOR YEARS.

ANTONIO CALLS 'EM
HIS SECURITY PEOPLE.

SO THAT'S WHAT YOU
CALL 'EM NOW, SECURITY PEOPLE,

'CAUSE YOU'RE, LIKE,
IN WITH THE FAMILY?

THEY'RE FUCKIN' SCUMBAGS JUST
LIKE YOUR BOYFRIEND, ANTONIO.

YOU FUCKIN' ASSHOLE.

WHY DON'T YOU DO YOUR JOB
AND LET ME DO MINE?

I AM DOIN' MY JOB.

I'M NOT GETTIN' CAUGHT UP
LIKE SOME PEOPLE.

IS THERE A PROBLEM, ANDRE?

IS THERE A PROBLEM?

THERE IS NO PROBLEM, SIR.

WE HAVE A GOOD GAME PLAN HERE,

AND I DON'T NEED IT
TO BE FUCKED UP

AT THE 12TH HOUR.

I NEED EVERYONE TO BE FOCUSED.

ALL RIGHT, CHECK OUT TENNESSEE.

SEE WHAT THE HELL
HE'S DOIN' IN MANHATTAN.

ANDRE,

MIND HANGIN' TIGHT
IN MY OFFICE FOR A MINUTE?

SO I GOT
TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR YOU

TO BEAT AROUND THE BUSH.

NEVER HAVE.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOIN' ON
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU,

BUT QUITE FRANKLY,
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.

I'M NOT GONNA JEOPARDIZE YOU.
I'M NOT GONNA JEOPARDIZE HER.

I'M NOT GONNA JEOPARDIZE
THIS CASE.

SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU
ONE TIME, MAN.

CAN YOU HANDLE THIS SHIT?

I CAN HANDLE IT.

I THINK YOU
SHOULD BE ASKIN' HER THAT.

IT'S MY BUSINESS.

OKAY.

I'M GOOD.

GOOD.

TALK TO ME.

I SLEPT WITH VEGA.

I KNOW.

HOW DO YOU KNOW?

IT'S MY JOB.

AND YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THAT?

NOW, YOU KNOW
WHAT I SAY, CASSIDY.

FUCK THE RULES
AND THOSE WHO WROTE 'EM.

I HEARD ANTONIO
TALKING TO DIEGO AND CATALINA

LIKE YACONELLI
WAS A TROPHY KILL.

HE SAID HE SQUEALED LIKE A PIG
WHEN HE CUT OFF HIS NIPPLE.

THEN HE LAUGHED,

AND HE SAID HE WANTED TO KEEP IT
AS A SOUVENIR.

I'M GONNA PULL YOU OUT.

YOU DID GOOD.

WE'RE HERE TO SEE MR. VEGA.

DO YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?

DON'T NEED ONE.

MAY I POUR YOU GENTLEMEN
SOMETHING SPECIAL?

YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

WE'RE ON DUTY.
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

I'LL HAVE
WHAT YOU'RE HAVIN'.

PLEASE,
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS VISIT, HUH?

WE'RE JUST HERE
TO INVITE YOU

TO PLAY 18 HOLES OF GOLF
WITH US ON SUNDAY.

YOU AVAILABLE?

I'M SORRY, GENTLEMEN.
I DON'T PLAY GOLF.

NEITHER DO WE.

I SEE.

CATALINA ISLAND.

WHAT IS IT, GENE?

"26 MILES ACROSS THE SEA,

"SANTA CATALINA'S
WAITING FOR ME,

"THE ISLAND OF ROMANCE,

ROMANCE."

YOU LIKE TO FISH?

WHAT?

NEITHER DO I.

I WONDER IF, UH,

ERIC CARTER LIKED TO FISH.

THE NAME STEVE YACONELLI
RING A BELL?

HE'S A COP THAT WORKED FOR US.

DEAD, MISSING PART
OF HIS ANATOMY.

YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?

NAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

HEY, GINO,
THINK STEVE LIKED TO FISH?

YOU SEE, I GET SEASICK,
THE INNER EAR THING.

COULDN'T STAND RIDING
THOSE FUCKIN' TEACUPS

WHEN I WAS A KID.

SAME THING
WITH THE MERRY-GO-ROUNDS.

I THINK I'D LIKE FISHIN', GENE,

IF I DIDN'T GET
SO FUCKIN' SICK.

I HATE PUKING,

BUT I LOVE CATCHIN' SHIT.

ENOUGH WITH THIS BULLSHIT,
GENTLEMEN.

I POUR YOU
A SHOT OF $800 TEQUILA,

AND YOU WANT TO COME IN HERE
AND FUCK WITH ME?

ARE YOU THAT CRAZY?

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

THIS PIECE OF SHIT
JUST CALL ME CRAZY?

YOU CALL ME CRAZY?

MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO TRY
BOWLING SOMETIME.

EVERY MAN NEEDS
SOME FUCKIN' FUN IN HIS LIFE.

I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN, MARINO.

COUNT ON IT.

YOU IDIOT.

[siren wailing]

SO HOW ARE THINGS GOING
WITH, UH--WITH PAM?

DON'T YOU EVER SHUT UP
ABOUT THAT?

YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WOMEN?

LET'S TALK ABOUT SOLEIL.

DID YOU EVER HIT THAT?
NO.

[flashlight clicks]

KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM.

YOU'RE MAKIN'
A BIG MISTAKE, PAL.

[flashlight clicks]

MOVE IT.

GET IN THE BACK.

GET IN THE FUCKIN' CAR.

[both panting]

FUCKER DESERVES TO DIE.

HE'S FUCKIN' DEAD ALREADY.

[siren wailing]

[monitor beeping]

IT'S DONE, SURE.

WHAT'S THE DAMAGE?
WILSON'S GOOD.

HIS WIFE JUST CAME
AND TOOK HIM HOME.

AND MARINO ACTUALLY
DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD

CONSIDERING HE JUST HAD THE CRAP
KICKED OUT OF HIM.

IS HE CONSCIOUS?
HE'S CONSCIOUS.

LIKE ALWAYS,
HE'S NOT SAYIN' SHIT.

HOW ABOUT WILSON?

HE GAVE THE NAME
OF THE DECEASED

AS FLAGMAN.

AND THAT'S IT?
NOPE.

WE GOT A HELL OF A MESS
AT THE CRIME SCENE,

AND THE PRESS IS ALREADY
BREATHING DOWN OUR BACKS.

KEEP THIS AIRTIGHT.

YOU'RE A LUCKY BOY.
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD.

NO BROKEN RIBS.

THE FACIAL LACERATIONS
AND CONTUSIONS ARE NO BIG DEAL.

THE NURSE WILL HELP YOU
FINISH YOUR PAPERWORK,

AND YOU'LL BE GOOD TO GO.

THANK YOU.

THIS SHIT STOPS NOW.

I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE.

I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU END UP
ON AN AUTOPSY TABLE, MIKE.

I CAN HAVE ANTONIO VEGA
PICKED UP RIGHT NOW

FOR SUSPICION OF MURDER
AND END THIS.

I WANT 'EM ALL.

BIG NICK.

YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.

CAN YOU CUT ME SOME SLACK
HERE, JUAN?

CAN'T DO IT, NICK.
IT'S BUSINESS.

HOW MANY TIMES

CATALINA SAYS

DECEASED VEGA FAMILY MEMBERS,

CATALINA VEGA, WAS ARRESTED

AT HER MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR HOME
IN MALIBU.

A PHOTO HAS BEEN RELEASED

OF THE 32-YEAR-OLD
FORMER BEAUTY QUEEN

WITH THE NOW FORMER
MAYOR ALVAREZ.

NO ONE IS COMMENTING
ON THE POSSIBLE CONNECTION

BETWEEN ALVAREZ
AND THE DEATHS AND ARRESTS

INVOLVING THE VEGA FAMILY.

THE ONLY COMMENTS FROM
NEW ACTING MAYOR STEVEN JAMES

ARE KUDOS TO LOS ANGELES
POLICE CHIEF EARL CURTIN

FOR A JOB WELL DONE

BE CONNECTED TO THE NEWS

TWO MEMBERS

ANTONIO AND DIEGO VEGA,

WELL, THAT'S SOME SHIT, MAN.

SPECIAL COMMENDATIONS
TO THE LAPD?

WE DO ALL THE WORK,
AND THEY GET ALL THE CREDIT?

THAT'S FUCKED UP.
LIKE I GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THAT.

I GOT TO SPEND MY TIME OFF
IN THERAPY.

EVERYBODY ELSE AROUND HERE
WALKIN' FINE; I GOT TO LIMP.

IT'S ALL GOOD, THOUGH,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I GET
