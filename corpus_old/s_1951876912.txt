We're here live with
a breaking news story.

Apparently, a local area man
has misplaced his black socks.

Mr. McCormick, would you please tell us
exactly what happened this morning?

Sure. Um, I got up.
It was a normal morning.

The kids are downstairs.
And, uh, my wife's giving 'em breakfast.

And all of a sudden, I noticed
that my good black socks are missing.

[Children Chattering]

Here's your boy, ma'am,
safe and sound.

Oh. Thanks, thanks.

Look, sweetie. Look!

The <i>Onion News</i> van!
Yeah.

In other news, a local
eight-year-old accidentally...

exercised his Second Amendment
rights yesterday...

when he blew off his head
with his father's semiautomatic rifle.

The fatal incident is being hailed
by gun rights activists...

as a victory for America
and the Constitution.

<i>[People Chattering]</i>

Nobody move, unless you want
your head blown off!
[Gasps]

You!
Please. Please don't shoot me.

I'll give you however much you want.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think I want money?

You think that's what this is about?

A big, angry black man
comes walking in waving a gun...

and you assume
he's robbing the place?

I ain't looking for no goddamn handout.
I'm looking for a motherfucking job, bitch!

Excuse me?
You heard me! A motherfucking job!

<i>Don't you see? If you give me money,</i>
<i>that'll just help me in the short term.</i>

But a job, that'll help me develop
valuable job skills and experience.

It's like teaching a man how to fish.
[Cocks Gun]

So quit stalling,
get your bitch ass back there...

and give me a 40-hour week position...

with vacation pay and benefits...

you piece of shit motherfucker.

And don't make me ask twice.

Back that ass up.

<i>Let's go. Let's go. I can help</i>

You in that apricot sweater suit,
get your bitch ass on over here <i>now!</i>

How can I help you today?

I'd like to deposit this check,
please, into my savings account,
and then I need to withdraw-

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just shut the fuck up for a minute.

What the fuck you doin', Liz Anne?
You callin' the cops?

No.
If that's the goddamned cops-

No, no, I swear. I was just on
with an account holder. I was advising him-

I'm gonna kill you, bitch!
[Groans]

Who the fuck's this?
You a cop? Mm-hmm.

<i>Well, what I recommend is that</i>
<i>you keep at least 500 in your checking...</i>

to just avoid
the minimum balance fee...

and put the rest in our money market which
will earn you an additional 2% interest.

<i>Right. You have a nice day, sir.</i>
<i>My pleasure. Uh-</i>

Liz Anne, uh, sorry.

My bad.

That's okay.
Honest mistake.

Armed gunman,
I've been watching you...

Hurry up! Hurry the fuck up!

Load the bag up with money,

You hurry up!
Hurry the fuck up!

Load the bag-


You sicken me.
Asking for a handout...

instead of raising yourself up
out of your situation through hard work.

[Groans]
Why don't you get a job like the rest of us?

According to statistics,
87% of U.S. citizens are obese.

And the surgeon general is taking steps
to address the problem.

As a result of the rampant
spread of obesity in the U. S...
<i>- [Camera Shutters Snapping]</i>

the government has been forced
to raise the definition of obesity...

from 55% body fat to 90%.

<i>[Archer] The move, which reduces</i>
<i>the number of obese Americans...</i>

<i>from 200 million to 185 million...</i>

was widely applauded
from coast to coast.

It's high time the government stepped in
and did something about this problem.

I don't wanna be obese.
Man, that shit is all fucked up.

In other news,
Georgia officials announced...

<i>plans to add a swastika and middle finger</i>
<i>to the Georgia state flag.</i>

Joe's Diner,
an unusual Atlanta area eatery...

was not based around any sports,
music, or movie-based theme-

Have you spoken to Norm about the changes?
<i>- Not yet.</i>

He's not gonna be happy.
<i>- But he's got no choice.</i>

Whatever the new parent
company says... goes.

Melissa Cherry is America's
biggest pop sensation...

selling millions of records
to her legions of teenage fans.

But is this young singer
sending the wrong message?

Kip Kendall reports.

<i>- [Kendall] Her new album,</i> Come With Me...
<i>- ## [Dance Rock]</i>

<i>has gone quadruple platinum</i>
<i>and made her a household name.</i>

# Baby, when we kiss
my heart just skips a beat #

#And when you hold my hand
Oh, I can hardly speak #

# Oh, yeah
I'm down on my knees #

<i>[Kendall] But some concerned parents</i>
<i>think Melissa Cherry's...</i>

<i>image and music are too sexy...</i>

setting an inappropriate
example for their children.

So, what do you say to
all the concerned parents out there?

Well, Kip, I honestly don't understand
what all the fuss is about.

My music isn't about sex.

<i>It's about being a girl</i>
<i>and having fun.</i>

But clearly the song, "Down on my Knees,"
Melissa, is about fellatio, isn't it?

Ew. It's about how...

like, when you have
a big crush on a boy...

<i>sometimes you get down on your knees</i>
<i>and, like, beg for their love.</i>

# Oh, I got so much love
I need to show it #

What about your first big hit,
"Take Me From Behind"?

"Take Me From Behind"
isn't sexual at all.

It's about love sneaking up on you.

You know, like from the behind.

<i>You know, it could be a boyfriend's love</i>
<i>sneaking up on you...</i>

or a friend's or even Jesus Christ.

# But what I really want is for
you to take me from behind #

# Oh, yeah #

# Oh, yeah #

# Oh #

# Oh, oh #

#When you love me right up front
you know that I don't mind #

# But what I really want is for you
to take me from behind #

Let's talk about the song,
"Lollipop Love."

"Lollipop Love" is...

the kind of love
that is just really sweet...

and you just kind of want to lick it,
you know, and suck it.

# Lollipop
Hey, yeah #

# Lollipop #

# Love #

# Lollipop #

<i># Love</i>
<i>Baby, baby #

# Lolly, lolly, lolly
lollipop #

<i># Oh-ho, lollipop love #</i>

Like a lollipop.

What about the song
"Shoot Your Love All Over Me"?

<i>That's about how, like,</i>
<i>when you're in love...</i>

you just wanna be covered in it.

# Shoot your love all over me #

# Oh, drown me in a milky sea #

<i># Love all over me #</i>

But clearly, the video
seems to tell a different story.

What kind is that?

The kind with a... cum shot.
<i>- I'm a virgin.</i>

How would I know what a facial is?

<i>Sometimes I like dressing up</i>
<i>sexy in my videos...</i>

but that's just my way
of celebrating being a woman.

<i>You know, people are always</i>
<i>gonna try to tear you down...</i>

<i>but that's their problem, not mine.</i>

<i>Because I know</i>
<i>who Melissa Cherry is.</i>

<i>She's just a good, old-fashioned country girl</i>
<i>from Monroe, Tennessee.</i>

And joining us to provide just that...

<i>are Nicholas Van Essen</i>
<i>and Raymond Marcus.</i>

<i>Offer us, if you will, your take on</i>
<i>how the film is doing thus far.</i>

I'll have to say, Kenneth,
that I am very impressed.

Sketch after sketch,
we're being treated to...

a brilliantly biting skewering
of contemporary social mores.

Well, Raymond, what do you think?

I must strenuously disagree.
<i>- Ah.</i>

This is nothing but vulgar, low-brow,
potty humor thinly disguised as satire.

<i>It saddens me that</i> the Onion <i>has stooped</i>
<i>to this lowest common denominator...</i>

pandering to the masses.

Well, now for a third opinion...

let's go straight to the source.

We have with us here
in the studio a very special guest.

Welcome, Masses.

So, what do you think of the film?

It's pretty cool so far, I guess.

That Cockpuncher dude is awesome.

Hi.

Pretty cute, huh?
Hi, Julie.

Have a seat. So, I understand this
is your first whodunit party?

Ah, you are gonna
have so much fun! Okay!

With any luck, by the end of the night
we'll figure out which one of us did the dirty deed.

<i>Any one of us could be the rapist!</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>

I'm sorry. Did you say "rapist?"
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

Don't these things usually
revolve around, um, a murder?

<i>Yeah, Julie, see,</i>
<i>we do this every few months...</i>

and frankly, we were getting
a little bored with murder.

So I was like, " Isn't there some other
violent crime we can reenact?"

And I'm in the store the other day...
and I find this.

How fantastic is that?

So, anyway, Julie,
since you are new, luckyJulie...

you get to be the victim.

<i>Okay?</i>

Ooh.
So, I want you to put this on. Hop up.

Okay, so here's what's gonna happen.

The lights are gonna go out.
So, you lie down on the floor.

We're all gonna come running in, but you're
gonna be unconscious, so you stay down there.

Don't you think this is a little... sick?

Oh, sweetie, it's all in fun.
No one's actually raping anyone.


I mean, you wouldn't have a problem with
a murder-mystery game now, would you?

I guess not.
Yeah, so why would you object to a game...

revolving around a lesser crime
where no one even loses their life?

Well, it's just different.
Oh, "it's just, it's just"!

Come on, guys.
Let's play the game.

Get your cards. Okay?

CD in here.
You got that on, sweetie?

Okay, get down on the floor.
Get down on the floor.

Ready for a rapin'?

Oh, no, please don't rape me.

Um, the prisoner

Okay.

Oh, no, no, Julie, you can't stand up.

Hey, Dirk.
Um, my computer...

it's a few years old,
and I feel like I'm ready for a new one.

I got just the thing.

The Bates 4000.
Absolute cutting-edge.

These babies came in on Tuesday.
They're packed, man.

Eighty "G's" of RAM.

We're talking
a quad-port 900 processor...

D.V.K. compatible memory card...

dual-burning DVD drives...

plus a 16,000 C.T.C. combo-drive...

with a plus-four digital
upgrade card.

This will knock the shit
out of your ass.

Well, I'm just looking for your basic,
simple home computer.

I know, your wife has you
by the purse strings. But you know what?

This is the Bates 4000.
It doesn't get any better than this.

It's not going anywhere.
This is the future.

Well, I have the Bates 1000
and that worked-

<i>Oh, excuse me.</i>
<i>You have the Bates 1000.</i>

Oh, that's great!
Fuck, man, wow!

<i>Maybe you should talk to a homeless woman</i>
<i>outside 'cause maybe</i> she'll <i>be impressed.</i>

Those things are barbaric.

I mean, last time I checked,
they didn't even have a delete key on it.

I'm joking, of course. But look,
this is the future. You get my point?

Yeah.
Okay? Let's write you up.

All right, let's do it.
All right, my friend.

Wow, honey. Are you sure
we needed such a fancy one?

You kidding? This thing's got
a quad-port 900 processor...

and a 16,000
C.T.D. combo-drive with-

Dude, you're not still using
the Bates 4000, are you?

That thing's ancient.

<i>- [Man #2] Really?</i>
<i>- Really.</i>

You got to get you one of these:
the Bates 5000.

Absolute cutting-edge.

<i>Wow, that is newer.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

[Clicks Tongue]

[Male Announcer]
The new Bates 5000.

Throw your 4000 away.
It's a piece of shit.

<i>[Man Over Radio]</i>
<i>This is Hard Drive Hal, your computer expert.</i>

<i>My guest today</i>
<i>is Bates C.E.O. Gil Bates.</i>

<i>Now, he's here to talk about perhaps</i>
<i>the most powerful machine ever built:</i>

<i>the Bates 6000,</i>
<i>and it's available in stores right now.</i>

[Tires Screeching]
[Horn Honking]

[Tires Screeching]
[Woman] Asshole!

Hey, I just dropped off
a shipment of the Bates 7000s.

Now, what do you want me
to do with the leftover 6000s?

6000s? Throw 'em in the fucking
garbage where they belong.

<i>That's right. Twice the memory</i>
<i>capacity of the 8000.</i>

[Woman Over Intercom]
Mr. Bates, you have a visitor.
Hang on. Come in.

Hi.

[Groans]
Bates was 42.

In other news, after a six-month
stint at the Betty King Clinic...

actor Bryce Brand
finally returned home today.

That's right, Norm. I'm here outside superstar
Bryce Brand's Hollywood Hills mansion...

where, at any moment, he's due to return
from his stay at the Betty King Clinic.

<i>- [Vehicle Approaching]</i>
Bryce!


Bobby, baby!

Bryce.
Bobby, baby!

Bobby, baby!

I'm back!
You look great.

I cannot tell you how good I feel
now that I'm off the drugs...

and high on life.

<i>Hey, that's what they're saying.</i>

<i>Oh, man, was I a mess.</i>

<i>[Laughs] But all that's changed now</i>
<i>that I'm clean and sober.</i>

You know, I never knew how amazing
life can be without the haze of drugs.

It's just the little things, like...

smelling the flowers-


<i>Or watching the sunset,</i>
<i>or just walking along the beach.</i>

You know, these things get me
way higher than drugs ever could.

<i>- [Laughs]</i>
That's great, um, Bryce.

So, we have got a lot of
catching up to do with your career.

[Sniffing]
<i>- Now I brought a script. It is fantastic.</i>

Actually, your part is comedic.
Uh, sort of a wise-cracking-

Bob, this chamomile is so amazing.

It is blowing my mind, man.
Smell this.

No. Thank you, though.

Um, back to the script.
Again, it took a lot to get this-

Bob, one thing sobriety
has taught me...

is that you have to take time out
to enjoy life's little pleasures.

Can you put the tea down for a sec?

Bryce?
Oh, my God.

<i>- Bryce.</i>
Oh, my God. [Sniffs]

The nation's rapidly growing
prison population...

which recently passed

Don't drop this shit on me, bitch!

What the fuck are you doing? Don't just
stand there! Get your man something to drink!

Damn, it's good to see some women.

Mm-mm-mm.

Mr. Prisoner, my tattoo hurts.

I'm Kenneth Garber.

And I'm joined by Kwame Roberts...

<i>president of the National Coalition</i>
<i>of African Americans...</i>

and James Nakatami, director of
the Asian American Alliance for Equality.

Mr. Roberts, let's start with you.

Your organization is not pleased with
this film's depiction of African Americans.

Oh, that is absolutely correct, Kenneth.

We are just about halfway
through the film...

and we've yet to see a dignified
portrayal of a person of color.

So far, we've only been shown
as vicious criminals or sex fiends.

Just take a look at that last sketch.

So, what specifically
is your group demanding?

The filmmakers put a positive black role model
on that screen in the next 10 minutes...

<i>or we will be organizing a nationwide</i>
<i>walkout of black moviegoers.</i>

That means every single African American
currently watching this film...

will exit the theater.

<i>Mr. Nakatami,</i>
<i>you are equally unhappy?</i>

<i>Thus far, there are maybe one...</i>

<i>or, at the most, two,</i>
<i>three Asian faces in the film.</i>

How do you feel about such
gross underrepresentation?

Me no "rikey."

Excuse me?

Me no "rikey."

And... back to the film.

But the suits at

But Friday is the day

It's also the day that

I mean, this Azmenistani, uh, sloppy

But it's a million miles away.
Nobody gives a fuck about it.

The more important news story

It's now time for our weekly
Inspirational Portrait.

<i>This week, the Brendan Laroux story.</i>

<i>[Kendall]</i>
<i>Brendan Laroux's story is one of dreams.</i>

<i>As a young boy,</i>
<i>he wanted to become a dancer...</i>

<i>but at the age of 12,</i>
<i>he lost his legs.</i>

<i>Now, this would be a setback</i>
<i>for any youngster...</i>

<i>but not Brendan, who set</i>
<i>his eyes on being a surgeon...</i>

<i>until, at age 14,</i>
<i>he lost his wrists.</i>

<i>[Laroux] Without my wrists, there was nothing</i>
<i>to keep my hands attached to my arms.</i>

So, even though my hands were fine,
l- I lost them too.

Now, Brendan may not have had as many
hands and legs as the other boys...

<i>but there was one dream</i>
<i>he didn't let go of-</i>

<i>becoming a professional</i>
<i>hockey player.</i>

<i>At first, the other players</i>
<i>treated him fairly.</i>

<i>But after seeing all the attention that</i>
<i>Brendan was getting, they became jealous.</i>

<i>The special treatment stopped. Brendan</i>
<i>toughed it out in the minors for two brutal years.</i>

<i>But it all paid off when</i>
<i>he finally got the call.</i>

<i>The coach said,</i>
<i>"How would you like to be pro hockey's...</i>

first legless, handless player?"

<i>[Kendall]</i>
<i>It was an inspiring night, full of inspiration.</i>

<i>But then, two days later...</i>

<i>Brendan found out that</i>
<i>his rib cage was backwards...</i>

<i>leaving his spine exposed, and that</i>
<i>he needed a complete muscle transplant.</i>

<i>The risky surgery lasted 720 hours.</i>

<i>Brendan came back better than ever.</i>

<i>[Crowd Groans]</i>

<i>Brendan persevered</i>
<i>and was selected M. V.P.</i>

<i>Just when it seemed like the dark clouds</i>
<i>had finally passed, Brendan contracted scurvy...</i>

<i>went bankrupt,</i>
<i>and his wife was eaten by wolves.</i>

<i>He was also molested</i>
<i>by his Uncle Jerry.</i>

<i>Today, Brendan's journey</i>
<i>has opened the door for many athletes...</i>

<i>who never would have</i>
<i>been given a chance...</i>

<i>if he hadn't broken down</i>
<i>pro sports' physical ability barrier.</i>

Athletes like Emma Heathcoat,
cerebral-palsy sufferer...

<i>and three-time national</i>
<i>equestrian champ.</i>

We're here in Santa Cruz, California today.
Let's listen in.

Stop the violence.

Stop the violence!

<i>Increase the peace!</i>

For the past three years,
Sloravia and Azmenistan...

they've been locked in
a pointless and bloody war.

Their cowardly leaders send
innocent young men into battle to die.

Well, you know what?

Shut up, dude.

We're convinced you are the man who can
finally bring peace to this troubled region.

Will you do it, Chad?
Will you help us increase the peace?

Fuck, yeah! Fuck, yeah, dude. I'm in!
Great.

Would you come with me, please?
Yeah.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.

Guys, chill, chill.
Let's take a chill pill here.

Don't you guys realize that war, no matter

America's finest news source.

Honey, it's about to start.

<i>[Announcer]</i>
<i>Featuring Dana Dobbs...</i>

<i>senior correspondent, Kip Kendall...</i>

and award-winning anchor, Norm Archer.
Good evening.

For the past 27 years,
I've sat at this desk...

dedicating myself to one thing-

delivering the news to you,
the American viewing public...

in the most fair, balanced,
serious way possible.

What's he doing?

Well, things are changing
in the news game...

and I've been under pressure
to change with them.

<i>The powers that be at this network</i>
<i>have done everything they can...</i>

to get me to compromise my values.

So what do they want me to do?

Plug our parent company's movies...

and other products like
a two-bit network news whore.

Motherfucker.

Well, I've been giving this
whole ugly business a lot of thought...

and just a few moments
before going on the air tonight...

I finally came to a conclusion.

And that conclusion is-

<i>Nobody move</i>
<i>or the anchor infidel dies!</i>

The Al-Q'Utaya
terrorist organization...

<i>officially declares war</i>
<i>on the decadent, immoral...</i>

United States of Satan.

We shit on your country!
And piss also!

That was good.
Tonight, on live television...

<i>the American people will watch</i>
<i>this great spreader of Western lies...</i>

get blown to pieces...

unless the United States government
formally apologizes...

for its rotting, immoral culture.

Like that's gonna happen.

Are you listening, Mr. President?

We might be fucked, sir.
We will do it.

We will kill him right here
if you do not meet our demands!

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

I don't think you have the balls.

Cockpuncher!

Ahmed, it is the mighty
puncher of cocks.


<i>I'm hungry.</i>

I could sure go for a sundae
topped with... crushed nuts.

Yummy.
[Yelling]

Cockpuncher!
Fuck him up!

Come on!

I believe you'll be
releasing Norm now.

Not so fast, Cockpuncher.

<i>[People Gasp]</i>

Cock blocked.

<i>[Ahmed Laughs]</i>

They blocked their cocks.

<i>You know that I don't mind #</i>

Come on, Cherry.

# Oh, yeah #

What the fuck is going on?

Ahman, think unsexy thoughts!

Think unsexy thoughts.

Think unsexy thoughts.

Enough! Your immoral Western sexuality
will not work on us.

Mr. President, the time has come to
give in to our demands.

If we do not hear from you in 10 seconds,
we will kill everyone in this studio.

We might be fucked, sir.

seven, six...

<i>[Speaks Spanish]</i>

<i>You know, Ahman,</i>
<i>violence is almost never necessary.</i>

<i>I admit, I've punched thousands</i>
<i>upon thousands of cocks in my life...</i>

but I've never killed anyone.

<i>Because no matter what</i>
<i>your religion might be...</i>

no matter
what your politics might be...

no matter how much
money's involved...

<i>there's never any reason</i>

Human life is the most

You know what?

You are absolutely
right, Cockpuncher.

Violence is not the answer.

<i>Terrorism never solved anything.</i>
<i>To hell with terrorism.</i>

Yeah! Yeah.

I'm sick and tired of
living in a fucking cave.

I'm sick of doing nothing
but cursing the West all day.

Jesus H. Allah!
I like the West!

God bless America.

<i>I like TV! And I like</i>
<i>bacon double cheeseburgers!</i>

Whoo!
And I like the rapping music!


But most of all...

I like this big-budget
blockbuster action hero.

Long live the mighty puncher of cocks!

[Cheering]
<i>- ¡Qué viva!</i>

Yeah! Whoo!

Hey, Norm. Some crazy shit, huh?
[Chuckles]

Look, with all due respect,
we just wanted to ask, um...

what were you gonna say
during your speech?

Yeah, we were wondering what
the conclusion that you came to was.

Well, I was going to say, " I'm mad as hell
and not going to take it anymore."

But after what just happened...
Shh.

I think I've learned a little lesson
I won't soon forget.

As a matter of fact, I think we've all learned
a few things in the past 90 minutes.

We've learned that Irishmen
have huge nipples.

We've learned that film-critic intellectuals
are a bunch of gaywads.

And, most of all, we've learned...

that creeping corporate
influence over the news...

protects us from terrorism.


Hey, everybody, we're all gonna get laid!

<i>## [Peruvian]</i>

Um, I can't help but think...

it must have taken a lot of courage
to make such a provocative film.

And joining us
to discuss just that...

<i>is the man who green-lit the film.</i>

Thanks, Kenneth.
Pleasure to be here.

So, uh, now, while you gave the makers
of this film tremendous leeway, obviously...

still, there was some material
that you simply refused to allow?

That's true.

Basically, as committed as I was to letting
these guys be free to do their thing...

there were simply some images
that I just didn't feel comfortable with.

Mm-hmm. But I understand
you did bring some clips.

That's right. Uh, I would like to show
some special bonus material.

These are scenes that didn't
make it into the movie.

Great. Let's take a look.

<i>[Bells Toll]</i>

<i>[Bubbling]</i>

[Meowing]
So what we do is we get the kitty...

and we put it in
a simple egg batter.

[Yowling]
Careful. Okay. Shh. That's fine.

And then we just simply roll it around...
[Meowing]

making sure we cover
the whole thing.

It's all right, baby. It's okay.
[Meowing]

Get him completely covered in
an her bed bread-crumb batter here.

[Meowing]
I see. Okay. Oh!

Thank you.
And into- Oh- into the canola oil.

You know, I think you have to
draw a line somewhere.
