And then one evening, 
Ladderzat as we are, I say:

Well, do you want to fuck? 

Well ... 

Do you worry if I even go? 
Not at all. 

I am Saturday, I think. 
Is everything okay? 

Damn, I am a nichtenmoeder. 

I am actually off 
Why not all men are like you. 

What am I doing here, Clay? 
What do you mean? 

I think you really fun. 

I think you also fun. You are 
Geweldigste the person that I know. 

No, you do not understand. 

I find fun. 

I could not. 
This may not. 

Why? Because I am gay? 
No. Yes. This is true not. 

It is not fair to you. 
And it is unfair. 

Wait. 

I must tell you something. 
Not. 

I must go. 

Do not pressure. 
That just happens. 

You think that I am a gay am, eh? 

Although it, then that's not a problem. 

Gay is nothing special. 
You stinks even if you poept. 

And we know who you want to fuck. 
Who then? 

You hold anyone for a ride. 

So really is not. 

You are not so bad when you are sober. 
Not nadaljuje. 

Later. 

Serena, you have a moment? 

Give us even, Tanya. 

She has magic fingers. 

Sun. What is there, Amanda? 
Over the freaks Party ... 

My guy is not me. 
You are in love with 'm. 

No, but it is simply nothing. 

My nicht married a gay. 
She knew nothing of his preference ... 

... Until it was him betrapte 
With his best friend. 

They flipte, ran the streets 
And was hit by a truck. 

Today she is not mentally. 

And thus do you mean ... 
I mean, word awake. 

Gay's manipulating women. 
If Clay is not. 

Good. Let's say 
That he is gay-so specify. 

Do you think he can? 
He has snikkel tasted ... 

... And that he would like to again, 
Because gay men are still. 

But why do we use them not yet 
Costs to be offensive. 

Listen. It is part of the Tau. 
In fact you are here for free. 

Stop you study and you vergooi 
Your life for a gay? 

You are such a beautiful, sensitive girl. 

You hear here, with your sisters. 

Okay, I have to college. 
Okay then. Forwards it. 

I see you next week. 

Can I talk about my essay? 

Your vision of Huckleberry Finn 
Left to be desired. 

Huck and Jim as homosexual lovers? 
Please ... 

You wanted something new, 
Something revolutionary? 

You have only the analysis. 
In fact, your essay conventional. 

Revolutionary? I thought not. 

Hey, where did you yourself hidden? 
Somewhere behind the rainbow. 

You can notice that gay, eh? 

I just want to ensure 
That nobody right for me. 

It might be simpler than that 
Intimate with someone who is right for you. 

And who fits there with me? 
Someone who is not gay. 

If I do all doubt, 
I go to the roof of our house. 

I look at the stars, 
Listen to the wind ... 

I smoke a cigarette 
And then it all falls however. 

Then I just had the time needed 
To the forced expulsion nonsense. 

But then that moment passed. 
But there will be another. 

You simply 
Appreciate the small learning. 

Like what? 
Like ... Staren to a cheeseburger. 

Wetend that nothing is 
Like that first bite. 

Or if you stoned hits and you realize: 
Hey, I was stoned. 

Or when a white plastic bag 
See running around in the wind. 

You are really difficult. 
But I can cry like a girl. 

This is such a moment for me. 

Here are with you, thinking: This is 
Why God has created women. 

That I would prefer not want to be. 

That I would want to do nothing more 
Then you kiss. 

Are you trying to save me, Tazwell? 

Let's eindje. 

Amanda, with Clay ... 

We must talk. 
Call me back? 

Damn ... 
You look cute. 

I fear destroy me. 
Few gay-here's me. 

Well, I am different. 
What about a kiss? 

I thought not. 
Plague-nou. You want it. 

God said that you do not really? 

Come on, now. 
Sherman, I said no. 

I want you. 
Word I raped? 

That may not, as the other it wants. 

My God, Clay. 
Hey, stop. Come Back. 

Clay, what is there? 

Help. 
Help still, please. 

How often should I 't repeat? 

I saw dispuutsjongens 
With sticks and chains. 

They attacked Clay and then fled. 
One called it 'billenmaat'. 

'Billenmaat'? 

Clay, you have to continue. 
Everything is okay. What is this? 

Mr. O'Brien says that dispuutsjongens 
You attack. 

What? Brennan. . . 
It was dark and it was fast. 

But I know what I saw. I think. 

But you confuse me. 
Kende-the so-called attackers? 

Why 'supposedly'? 
Kende them, they wanted to get to know you ... 

So he has provoked this? 
He's the victim, homophobic. 

Cessation. 
What is it? 

This is a nightmare. 

Listen, I fell. 
There was no attack. 

Not doing this is not good. 
Go home. 

You hear when 't problem 
Or in the solution. 

Wegwezen. Now. 
Okay then. 

But you hear more from me. 
Definitely. 

What you will. Well, can I go now? 
Case closed? 

You should get out at the sister. 
And do me a lol: 

Run your careful next time? 

Stelletje queers. 

We exhibit If These Walls Could Talk II, 
Followed by a discussion. 

Clay Adams came against potenrammers 
And the campuspolitie silent about it. 

Discrimination. 
Clay? Is everything okay? 

Great, but he should be no indictment. 
He denies' t even. 

How do you know there? 
I was there. 

Here they are not gone. 
Quietly, now. 

You argue too quiet. 
Bessie, now silent.

And the Straight Men For Change. 

This is not just a gay affair. 
Let the dragon loose. 

Do not put in a corner. 
We are fighting back. 

We are fighting back. 

Why you called me back? 

Sorry, I had the pressure. 
I have now hurry, so I can still speak. 

And the party tonight? 

Oh yes, the party ... 

It is not a good idea if you will. 
Because Tazwell also, and ... 

What's going on? 

I can no longer, Clay. 
Please forgive me.

Where's Clay? 
That is over. 

You are klos. 
And? 

Amanda, where is the boy? 
Listen Serena, I ... 

You know what's so gay.

Jackpot. 

Well, I hope he comes soon.

Do you really do that? 

And you, then? 

What are you doing here? 
We should talk, okay? 

Is this a costumed party? 
You need to go. 

Even it. I must tell you something. 
Later, okay? 

It can not wait. 

What is happening? 
Listen ... 

What? What is it then? 

Through you I feel a real man. 

Maybe I am not really gay. 

What are you talking about? 
Come on, what? 

Amanda, I am in love with you. 
What? 

I am in love. 
No, that's not saying. Stop. 

Well done, Amanda. 

What is here on? 

Rah, come back now.

Please forgive me. 

It is hilarious. 

Clay, please ... 

Welcome sister. 

Is everything okay? 

What's wrong? 
I am in love with you. 

Of course not. 

That was bizarre, man. 

Listen, you are just Saturday. 
Doe equally easy ... 

You know what it's like to share a room 
With a hetero ...

That is zaniè. 

It is unfair. 

Why am I so bad? 
Net you seemed pretty good at it. 

I just wanted ...

You know what? 
Get the klere it.

But he wants me, not talk. 
Remember him now. 

You need to find someone you 
Happy. That you earn. 

Someone like Taz. You still 
With him to the inauguratiefeest, eh? 

Let's now that gay loose. 
Perhaps you are right. 

Rah Have you spoken yet? 
Yes, dialed. 

He called me a slut Jewish 
And when he hung on. 

Yes, what does it matter. 

I am here, dear. 
I leave you never loose. 

Okay ... 
Do you have a minute? 

Be proud, my gay brother. 

Marjorie? Stop it. 

I tried to reach you. 
Everything good? 

What is all this? 
You have been attacked, bitch. 

No, that was me zaniè-Sherman tricky. 
O my goddess. 

And I must tell you something. 

I am not really gay. 
I knew it. 

It was me to a girl. 
That is bi-zar, Clay. 

It is a long story. 
Can we stop this? 

You are a bastard. This demonstration 
Takes place. With or without you. 

Wen only. You are Rosa Parks 
Of the gay movement. 

It does not even somewhere. 
This is politics. You do not. 

I have a song about you. 
Lazer-op. 

Greek inauguratiefeest 
Welcome brothers and sisters 

It seems the schoolbal did. 

Do I have my partner fuck 
On a golf course? 

Today is a gay. 

Tomorrow is the one black. 

Or a Latino. 
Or a jew. 

Or that guy in that wheelchair. 

Think of Clay. 
Stop the hate, thinking of Clay. 

Stop the hate, thinking of Clay. 

Got it to you in the mood? 

Yes, it's great. 

View these fine people there agree. 
It looks beautiful, Amanda. 

Could I borrow him? 
I need help for the party. 

Sure. 
Super. 

Taz? 
I would take back. 

Professor Jackson, what are you doing here? 

Do you want a hoisting? 

Sorry, Taz. 
My gums do too much. 

Hey, you can not make. 

You are not really gay, eh? 

How do you know that? 

I work here for six years. 
I recall nephomo's really there. 

You will find me ridiculous. 

If you are nineteen ... 
Who is it not? 

You all want 
Someone else. 

Everything for the inevitable 
To escape justice. 

What is it? 
That your worst fears come true. 

That you really are but who you are. 

That your own identity 
Overtakes you again. 

And before you know it, 
Your life consists of nothing more ... 

... Then unpaid bills, 
Unfilled desires ... 

Children ... you should feed 
And long silences. 

This is the worst 
Thing I have ever heard. 

Sorry, I would not be didactic. 

When I graduated, I 
Dancer. And I was good. 

Tapdansen, ballet, jazz ... 
But I stopped it. 

I came with my fat ass 
Not on Broadway. 

And here I am now. 
On the floor with you. 

Maybe it will be for me ... 
What? 

I do not know ... 

Anders. 

You wanted to be a revolution? 
Proof it. Be brave. 

I have to go. 

Yes, hear. 
End of lesson. 

You are cool, Professor Jackson. 
You too. 

We will see who dispuutslui 
What real power is. 

Bestorm the party. 

Hey, there you are. 
I was looking for you al 

I am an idiot. 

Get the klere. 

I did it for you, Amanda. 
You should know what he is a bag. 

You mean so much to me. 

Let those guys oprotten. 
We have no need for them. 

You know what? If you want me to bed, 
You should simply ask. 

What do you say? That is disgusting. 
I am not a lesbian. 

How can you say that now? 
I am not a lesbian. 

I have to go. 
I am not. I am not. 

No justice, 
No peace. 

The hours of vengeance has come, 
Bastards. 

Hey, stop this. 
What are you doing now? Stop. 

I am Clay Adams. 

This is nonsense. 
There were no potenrammers. 

Sherman Jessup fell to me 
Not when I 'm wanted to play. 

He wanted 't themselves. He flirtte with me. 

If a man or woman 'no' says, 
They mean 'no'. Klootzak. 

Stay of myself. 
Not to my her. 

Listen, I ... 

I am just a sukkel, 
Who did as if he was a gay. 

So that a girl would see me. 

I am in love with her. 

Yes, I love her. 
Because I am not gay. 

I have thought about it. 
But it was nothing for me. 

Do not forget it. 
I love a kamelenboer. 

Okay, let's stop this. 
This is my fault. 

Look around you. 
You do not differ so much. 

Do you see who is next to you? 
Give them a knuffel. 

I believe it. 
We turn it into a massive knuffel. 

Forget it. 
Head-close, pot. 

That I thought not. You dirty ... 

Amanda, wait. 
Can I please explain? 

What? That you lied to me you 
Could sew? I get the picture. 

But this Saturday not. 

Or rather ... Yes. 
But when it became more. 

And you lied. 
Okay, we lied both. Can I leave? 

Let me now thuisbrengen. 
To Pittsburgh? Because there go I go. 

So your flight to your Mommy? 

Well ... 
Zak but in the shit. 

Amanda ... 
Do not behind me. 

Rotjong. 

I did not know you were here. 

Wait. 

Will it ever return to normal between us? 
No idea. 

I am sorry, man. 

What then? 
That you do not want to suck my dick? 

Yes, that I am sorry. 

I should be glad. 

And if they could, 
, I would go for you. 

Because if I would fall on men ... 

... I was the happiest guy 
On earth. 

What are you still a banal male. 

I tried seriously. 

Shall I tell you something? 

You really terribly bad coast. 
Rot on, man. 

Meen you know? 

Come on now, I was Saturday. 

You had to wait outside. 
And if someone sees me? 

Wen only. 

Not yet out of the closet ... 
But with a mouth like a vacuum cleaner. 

You deserve it, measure.

Well ... 

Could I even our room? 

What's happened with you? 
It looks like a pot. 

Can I help you? 
Oops, someone has problems. 

What is there, guy? 

I must tell you something. 
Well ... 

You are the daughter I never had. 
Toe but. 

I am in love with a girl. 

What do you say? 

I lied to you. 
I am not gay. 

Even slowly. Are you straight? 
I am sorry. 

Are you angry now? 
No, I am not angry. 

You do not know what 't for me means 
That a hetero want to be homosexual. 

That is something beautiful. 
Since we already struggling for so long. 

I am so happy, I can get janken. 

But why would you 
Want to be a gay? 

So that Amanda would fall on me. 
The nichtenmoeder? Slim, hear. 

Now they hate me. 
But not when you are gay. 

That does not matter. 
What no-one is gay or straight. 

What counts is whether you are violently. 
And very magnificent. 

Think really after. 

You know who you are. 
That is so valuable. 

I would give my right arm 
To feel that again. 

Because before you know ... 

... Time has gone. 

What should I do? 

Be the guy who you are. 

Intense. 

I thought you had already left. 
M 'n bus is too late. 

How is it with you? 

The Tau have me my scholarship decreased. 
My mother is evil. 

But my aunt arranged work 
At a cosmetics department, so ... 

I referred: How is it with you? 
That I know well. 

I am ruined. 

We both. 

You think, 
Me that you absolutely do not know. 

But believe me: 
That I could be your friend ... 

... This is the best 
What ever overcome me. 

Maybe you think nonsense, 
But I think ... 

... That I am by that gay-stalking 
A decent hetero. 

I miss it really, are you. 

I am the same guy. 
But who is it? 

Just a guy. 
Just another crazy guy. 

That top is great. 

I have no doubt about the colour. 
Really? It fits well with your eyes. 

The bleed is daring ... 
It is a brave choice. 

I see there are good, eh? 
Definitely, girl. 

Now everything is different. 

I hope so but. 

The Palestinians must be free. 
There are children dead. 

That is because the Zionisten. 
Keep your head and fuck me. 

Thank you very much. 

Day, ladies. 
Go now sit, we do not bite. 

Unless you want to. 
Head-close, trut. 

You are quite gay, eh? 
Absolutely. 

What have you done? 
Aanranding. 

Yes, I too. 
Leugenachtige babes ... 

Right. He wanted it yourself. 
What? 

Fern, massaging me. 

Hey, piece. 

You have missed your bus. 

There will still be one.
