(crashing gong)

(haunting eastern flute melody)

(bubbling brook)

(speaking in foreign language)

(breathy yawn)

He'll show.

Yamata can't do business
here without Yakuza approval.

Let's just wrap it up, we've
been watching for three days.

I've been watching,
you've been eating.

I'm not really hungry
you know, I'm horny.

I spend more nights with
you than I do with my wife.

 You better
go call for backup.

Yes Mother, I'll
wait this time.

(speaking in foreign language)

(fearsome grunt)

(pained cry)

(intense grunts)

(anguished shout)

(battle cries)

(hard thud)

(frustrated grunt)

(brawling yells)

(breaking crunch)

(whipping thunks)

(fearful murmur)

(grinding snap)

(painful yowl)

(pained cries)

(pinging gunshot)

(speaking in foreign language)

(somber chanting)

Mitara Hoshino, watch.

Watch and see what I can do.

First the head will swim,

then the sweats and the pain,

then he will die.

There is nothing you can do.

(whipping thump)

(ringing lasers)

(distant sirens)

(speaking in foreign language)

(choking gurgle)

Thomas?

(speaking in foreign language)

(chirping birds)

 Councilman Royce,
do you have anything to say

to those responsible for
the death of Father Munoz?

Congratulations, you have
just made the top of my list,

and we will find you.

Karen, hi.

Another drive by?

You didn't hear?

 Oh my god.

Listen Karen,
I'm really sorry.

I heard he was a
friend of yours.

Mine and about a thousand
kids he saved from the streets.

Father Munoz is the only
reason we don't have

a full-scale gang
war on our hands.

He kept the lid on.

Well the lid's off now.

Eyewitness saw
three black males,

all dressed in purple and black.

Icemen, Jesus.

Mm-Hm, must've wanted
it advertised too.

You wear anything but
orange on Malitos turf,

you might as well have
a target on your back.

Check this out, machine
gun, NATO caliber.

Where the hell did Icemen
get this kind of hardware?

(speaking in foreign language)

Listen to me, when
I ask a question,

you answer you lying spic fuck.

Wait.

My favorite ex-partner.

Let him go.

Sure, hold hands with him.

(speaking in foreign language)

You'll see me again beaner.

Yeah, next time grow
some hair on your head

so I can figure out
which end is your ass.

(assorted chuckling)

Ray, show a little class.

I got somethin' else I
wanna show you, sweetcakes.

Oh really?

You wanna show me
your penis, Ray?

Is that it?

Is that what it's gonna
take to make you happy?

Well go ahead, whip
that bad boy out here.

Just give me a second.

Damn, left my magnifying
glass at home.

Let us handle this Hector.

Sorry detective,
Malitos got rules.

Ten of them for one of us.

The Malitos also have a treaty

with the 72nd street Icemen.

Yeah, well that treaty
just left in a body bag.

You're a leader Hector, think
of the rest of these people.

We can take care of ourselves.

Rita, come with me please.

Please?

Look, what happened
to Father Munoz

want that to happen
a hundred times that?

You told me once that
you wanted a fresh start.

Hector listens to you.

I need you to buy me some time

so I can find out who did this.

Please.

Father Fernando
Munoz lost his life

in a hail of machine gun fire.

The priest gained media
attention when he forged

a truce between the
Malitos and the Icemen,

two of the city's most
violent street gangs.

Last weekend, that
truce was shattered

with the drive-by shooting
that took the life

of James Hobbs, 19.

Ironically, Hobbs funeral
was just held today.

(soft sobs)

(foreboding music)

(low chanting)

(rumbling traffic)

(hysterical screams)

(angry grunt)

 LAPD, right?

$100 even.

For a ride from the airport?

Next time take bus.

 All I got's yen.

What's this? American joke?

My flight was late,

I didn't have time
to exchange my money.

Sure, I haven't heard that
one for almost one week.

C'mon, you pay.

Hey, you pay.

(speaking in foreign language)

C'mon, you pay.

Follow that car,
this is an emergency.

This is emergency.

I'll get you the
money, just go.

You pay, or I'll call cops.

Listen to me
asshole, I am a cop.

Now follow that damn car.

Okay.

(screeching tires)

I'm not scared
of you Godzilla,

I've seen all your movies.

(snarky chuckle)

Right there.

ID, ID.

What is this, I
don't read Martian?

Speak English?

Eng-rish?

Eng-rish is not one of
my favorite languages,

but I speak it reasonably well.

Thomas Hoshino, Kyoto Police.

I'm here to take
Yamata back to Japan.

All by yourself?

Your friend here
just busted up a bar

and three cops in
Japtown last week.

Now the feds want to see him,

your people want
him back in Japan

they can have him
teriyakied for all I care,

but not until tomorrow.

I need to talk to him.

Sorry.

He's one of the men
who killed my partner.

Alright, you can
ride up with us.

But keep your hands off him.

(soft chuckle)

Hey, why is it Japanese
always sounds like

worn-out transmission?

Where's your partner?

The one who does
your killing for you?

Let me propose a
business arrangement.

You talk to me
now, or I set you up.

I'll send you gifts in prison.

You'll receive
special privileges.

Your associates
will be arrested.

Hey, hey, hey-hey.

You have until we leave.

(malicious chuckle)

Sayonara.

Yeah.

Thank you.

(pained groans)

This sucker's dead.

You can't die now
you son-of-a-bitch.

What the hell
did you say to him?

I told him I
would dishonor him.

Well, sure, that's enough
to give anyone a heart attack.

Get in.

C'mon.

You've been much
too kind already.

You should see me when I
really turn on the charm.

Look, the captain says I
have to keep an eye on you

until you leave town.

It's official, so can
I take you to a hotel?

I have to go somewhere
first if you don't mind.

Why not, only other
thing I have to worry about

is gang war.

This car is huge.

It's what God
meant cars to be,

till you guys came along
and screwed it all up.

 Low quality and
lack of reinvestment ruined

the American auto industry.

 Oh yeah?

 Yes.

 Oh yeah?

(squawking brakes)

Not bad.

This is your partner's uncle's?

Yes.

Buntoro Iga was my
teacher for several years.

Now I was just a boy then, but,

I remember him as a
very traditional man.

Don't worry toots,
I'll mind my manners.

You must understand he
spent most of his life

as a Shinto priest.

(bubbly doo-wop music)

(speaking in foreign language)

Thomas!

(joyful shouting)

I'd know you anywhere.

You've grown into
a fine, strong man.

Ooh, and this?

Oh, Ryder, Karen
Ryder, detective.

A detective? A
beautiful detective.

How fascinating.

Don't tell me, let me guess.

English and French.

How did you know?

The eyes,
cheekbones, exquisite.

Hey, how 'bout some drinks,
scotch, rye, bourbon, wine?

I have quite a collection.

I bet.

Thomas?

Perhaps some tea, Igasan.

I've come on a very
serious errand.

Patience, we will
cross at the ford.

Musashi, you read that to me.

Ah yes.

But I was thinking of
John Wayne, Red River?

Wonderful film.

You will stay for
dinner, won't you?

Oh, I have to go back--

Good, good.

You haven't lived till you
have tasted Fettuccine Buntoro.

Excuse me one moment,

Katie? Marico?

Rum punch for our guests.

This is the part where
we cut our stomachs open?

Marico and Katie are
my executive assistants.

I couldn't run
business without them.

Business?

Oh, well Hoshino told me
that you were a priest.

Oh, I was.

I was! Ladies, drinks.

And then, one evening,
I was meditating...

You know what satori is Karen?

Sure, there's a
great little satori bar

down the street
from my apartment.

(boisterous laughter)

Good, good.

But, my satori is the
truth behind all truth.

I sense the pressure
society puts on us to take.

My mission was clear.

Help others fulfill the
universal human need to give.

I decided to help
the wealthy first.

They give $500 and up for
these in Beverly Hills.

Authentic Chinese warrior.

Turn 'em out on a
computerized machine

in Little Tokyo for what,
twelve bucks a piece.

Why you old bandit.

Oh, I love birds.

What's his name?

Rasputin.

Oh.

I think he likes you.

Now.

Igasan,

I have dishonored your family

and myself.

I came here

for the men who killed Yuji,

but I failed.

There is no dishonor
in a true heart, Thomas.

Was Yuji a good policeman?

He was the best, always.

I depended on his strength.

And sometimes, he made me laugh.

(speaking in foreign language)

Kampai.

I will avenge his death.

Was there something strange
about the way Yuji died?

There was a man,

an assassin who
worked for Yamata.

He raised a kind of
power that I could feel.

He barely touched Yuji.

Check it out, check it out.

I misjudged, Yamata didn't
want Yakuza permission.

He meant to take over the
entire local operation.

So what was he doing here?

Maybe hiding, or looking
for money to finance

his move in Japan.

(choking groan)

This man, Yamata,

he simply fell dead
in the hallway?

There was no violence?

None.

I have to see the body.

(heavy breathing)

 You can't just
walk into the morgue.

 Trust me.

(low chanting)

(speaking in foreign language)

Holy shit.

Just let me do the talking.

(key tones)

LAPD could we please
have an attendant

at the records desk.

Right here, shot.

Hi, this is
Detective Karen Ryder,

officer needs assistance.

I'm at the morgue.

He was here.

He is here.

You don't carry a badge,
you don't carry a gun,

stay put Hoshino.

(dark orchestral music)

Icemen.

What?

Their gang colors.

Why would the Icemen do this?

(crashing door)

Hoshino!

Hoshino get down!

(grunting skirmish)

(distant sirens)

Five years on the force and
I never had to shoot anyone.

 Good.

So this character
can resurrect people,

bring them back to life?

No.

Yamata's death
was not a reality,

but an illusion
created by a blow

purposely wide of the mark.

It is said that some
truly gifted healers

can restore life.

But the man you saw tonight

was not a healer.

He is someone who has
surrendered himself

to the dark powers.

Your assassin is a master
of the Death Touch.

I always thought
that was just a myth.

Oh the death touch is real.

It's the opposite of the
ancient healing arts.

An assassin like this one

can apply Chi energy
with a mere touch.

He can cause death,
or illness now,

or weeks in the future.

This is nuts.

I'm gonna put him away.

I've already lost a nephew
to this assassin Thomas,

now I've seen him.

He's your opposite,
your mirror image.

The legends say there is a
creature like him in every age.

The essence of evil.

He's the deadliest man alive.

Of course, I understand.

First your prisoner
dies, then he escapes.

That's easy.

What I don't understand
is how you two could take

a simple extradition and turn it

into Pearl fucking Harbor.

This is my responsibility,
I'll handle the situation.

Wrong Akita, you don't
handle anything in my town.

His name is Hoshino, Captain.

I know what his name is.

Back in Japan they
call him Akita.

You know what that is?

A Japanese dog dives
headfirst into everything,

never knows when to back off.

Your superiors are real
interested in hearing

your version of this story,

back in Kyoto.

Sir, I can't leave until I--

You're out of here tonight.

End of story.

(light knock)

Captain, Decklin,
Treasury Department.

 Sorry
to interrupt, sir.

Ah, you're not interrupting,
we're finished here.

You have a nine o'clock
reservation tonight

into Tokyo.

That's a reservation you're
gonna have to cancel Captain.

Says who?

Got a letter from
your division commander,

should explain
everything right there.

And I cleared this
with your department.

We want Yamata.

What for?

That's classified,
but you are the only one

who's seen his enforcer
up close, Jaho.

Excuse me, but
Jaho is not a name,

it's a kind of
ninja black magic.

(light scoff) Ninja?

You don't mind if we stick
to the 20th century, do you?

I had Interpol send
over their photo books,

I want you to look
at the mugshots,

every single one of 'em.

And, uh, you mind if I
take a minute outside?

Be my guest.

We'll coordinate on this.

Decklin's the fed that
wanted to see Yamata yesterday.

Yes, I know.

Look, what happened last
night was gang related, Captain.

No doubt, they stole
the priest's body.

Father Munoz?

 Yeah.

But why?

All I know, is that they
scrambled up the morgue

so that we couldn't tell
which bodies were missing.

I've gotta know what the
feds are up to with Yamata.

So, he's your baby.

Who?

The Akita.

 Again?

Stay on him.

Oh Captain, you're
gonna have to get somebody

who gets along with Japs.

Japanese.

Do I have crap in my ears,

or did I just hear
racial bigotry

coming from a detective
in my department.

Captain we have two
gangs ready to go to war.

Your gang activities
are on hold.

But why?

Look,

just give him the tour,
show him some mug books,

take him down to the range,

take him down to the goddamned
movies, I don't care.

Just keep him off the street.

And Ryder,

the Kyoto police seem to
think that he might have been

responsible for his
last partner's death.

Thanks.

(quick rapping knock)

 Councilman Royce.

Harry, good to see you.

 Councilman.

Detective Ryder is it?

Mm-Hm.

Have a seat please.

Thank you sir.

 How can I help you?

Well, Harry, I've
got a situation

I'm gonna really
need your help with.

My people finally
set up a meeting

between the Malitos
and the Icemen,

and it's for the
22nd of this month.

Excuse us please.

Excuse me.

I think I can help you.

You can reach
me at this number.

Thank you Hoshino.

Our government
appreciates your help.

Talk to me and nobody else,

we think Yamata's bought
a cop in this division.

Look, I have orders to
give you the grand tour.

Let's hit it.

(clears throat)

On your right is
an office, off-ice.

And on my left, a
sleeping policemen, on duty.

You want perfection,
get a robot.

It's obvious you
don't like my country

and I don't like yours.

Yeah, well I have my reasons.

So do I.

And just where the hell
do you think you're going?

Little Tokyo, I'm
gonna find Jaho.

The hell you are.

Am I your prisoner?

Not yet.

Look, we both have our orders.

It happens to be my job to
keep you out of circulation.

You get in between
me and my job,

and I will find 50
reasons to lock you up.

Don't worry, I'm not
gonna give you the slip.

Might ruin your reputation.

Hey, anyway you
want it Hoshino.

You don't have to
play nice with me

just because I'm
a woman, Hoshino.

As it happens, I had
to be twice as good

as a man to make detective.

And how did you earn
your sterling reputation?

The Akita?

I was 12 years old
when I moved to Japan.

The only half-white
kid at my school.

To survive, I had to become
more Japanese than the Japanese.

A good old-fashioned
banzai charge

saved my tail more than once.

Does it frighten you?

What?

Being alone in the
dark with a mad dog?

I haven't been afraid
of anything in pants

since, I don't know, I was

six years old.

Excuse me.

Mugs looks, never seen
this many mug shots.

S'pose we actually have
to do this right now?

This?

This is the cause of half
the problems in the world.

The watch?

Time, time changes
all the rules.

My dad carried this watch
to work every morning

for 29 years.

He was a foreman
in Flint, Michigan.

GM.

Where they make cars?

Where they used to
make cars, Mr. Hoshino.

One year before his retirement,
the plant closed down.

Japanese imports.

Other auto plants
weren't hiring, so,

he got a job running
a liquor store.

And one night a kid came in,

shot him in the heart with a 22.

That's why you became a cop.

And came out here, I
couldn't stay in Flint anymore.

Look, it's almost four.

Just between you
and me, alright?

I called one of my snitches,

he's an ex-gang member.

He said that the Icemen

meet with some people
from out of town.

You're strictly
along for the ride.

I mean it Hoshino.

Sure you don't want some fries?

No thanks.

How can you eat that mess?

Hey, I don't
need dietary advice

from a guy who probably eats

raw octopus tentacles
for breakfast.

(radio chatter)

Leave the radio alone.

It was modern.

Yeah, before it was
so goddamn modern,

they used to make
them in this country

and they worked just fine.

You Americans are very touchy.

It's probably nothing.

Right.

Is that it?

Yeah.

Then what are we doing
parking way over here?

Because they know my car.

You've been in there?

The Diamond? Sure,
lot's of times.

It's an Iceman hangout.

Is it dark?

Very.

Why?

Maybe one of us ought to
slip inside and take a look.

No.

Yamata's car.

Yes.

But this time let's do it right.

We'll stay with the car,
we'll call for backup.

You're right, someone
should stay out here

in case they come out.

Hoshino!

I'll just blend
in with the crowd.

It won't work.

(heavy gangster rap)

I want associate
guarantees the authorities

won't interrupt us.

And we guarantee
the merchandise.

So all you have to do

is show up with the money.

Ah, shit, that ain't
gonna be no problem.

Good.

I'll have a beer.

Thanks.

(combative hits)

 C'mon man.

C'mon, get him down.

Son of gun is quick.

(pained grunts)

Hit him, hit him, get him man.

Oh man, c'mon homey.

Knock him down.

Ah, here's my man.

(hooting cheers)

Yeah, do it again.

Do it again my brother.

That's right, you got it goin'.

(forceful grunt)

Here's my man, here's my man.

 That's right.

(suspenseful music)

(pained moans)

Game over, game over.

(two gunshots)

Police.

These men are wanted

for conspiracy
charges in connection

with the Ku Klux Klan.

I knew your ass was
too weird to be straight.

You and your pasty-ass
peckerwood friend.

What?

Shut the fuck up
you blue-eyed bitch.

 KKK is
tryin' to set up the Icemen.

These men are in my custody.

Hell yeah, we gonna
take care of these two

the old-fashioned way.

(concussive boom)

Let's go!

(screeching tires)

Shit.

Get in, let's go.

(intense orchestral music)

(squealing tires)

(anguished groans)

(stressed coughs)

Hoshino.

God, I can't take you anywhere.

(squalling tires)

C'mon, let's go.

That policeman has
caused us enough trouble.

He's finished.

I'll take care of the woman.

First things first,

I don't think our black
friends will do business

with us any longer.

So,

our partner will make a deal

let's remind them how much
they need our merchandise.

(heavy knocking)

Oh, let's get him in there.

Has he met the assassin again?

Yes.

Is he gonna be okay?

Marico! Brandy!

Let's get him down here.

It's his back.

Oh, there may
be serious damage.

My acupuncture needles

and incense from
the drawer, quickly.

I hope it's not too
late to save him.

(bass laden doo-wop)

Feelin' better?

Don't mind me Hoshino, I
grew up with three brothers.

Besides, I thought men and
women took baths together

all the time in your country.

That's different.

Really?

Oh, you mean because
of the ice water.

Poor Thomas.

I suppose it is a
belittling experience.

Remember when I asked
you why Yamata was here,

what you said?

Hiding out?

No, no, no.

About financing his
takeover in Japan.

He's here to make money.

I also found out
our friend Decklin

is with the Treasury Department,

Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

So why do you suppose
they want Yamata?

He's selling alcohol
and tobacco to the gangs.

Exactly.

Guns and weapons.

American gangs
already have weapons.

Maybe these are
special weapons.

I'm freezing!

You're a samurai.

Ah,

Now I'm scalded.

I'm a frozen, scalded samurai.

Any permanent damage?

The wells are deep.

I had to use all
the katsu I know,

energy restoration techniques.

I think he'll be alright.

But?

Fate has pitted Thomas
against this assassin.

When day meets night,
only one can survive.

We must complete the training
you began as a child.

We must start it, immediately.

Thanks anyway,

but I remember those torture
sessions you call training.

Train or die, drink.

Oh, gah, what is this stuff.

Herb tea with vitamins.

Drink up.

(light belch)

(ethereal music)

(suspenseful electronica)

(quickening syncopation)

(squealing tires)

(quickened gunshot)

Iceman.

(roaring blast)

So much for sales resistance.

Now we are going to leave
a message for the Malitos,

and I need your help.

You don't mind, do you?

No, of course not.

That's what I like about you,

you keep your mouth shut.

(distant sirens)

(malicious chuckle)

(turbulent flames)

Precision Thomas.

Each pressure point is
smaller than a fingertip.

(forceful grunts)

Muscle power, where is your
focus, where is your chi?

Imagine your arm is a--

Is a high-pressured
hose, I remember Igasan.

But I haven't slept
much the past few days,

so if you don't mind--

I do mind.

(chirping crickets)

Good.

Now,

gather the force of
the waters in your palm

and project it
through your fingers

and try to throw me back.

Rasputin can pee
stronger than that.

How am I supposed to push
you if I can't touch you?

It's impossible.

(haunting flute)

Hit me.

Igasan.

Hit me now.

(pained grunt)

True master can repel or
draw a man 15 feet away.

Teacher is the needle,
the disciple the thread.

Come, come on.

You have a gift, Thomas.

I sensed it when you were a boy.

Unlike your enemy, you
can heal with these hands

as well as destroy.

But first you must tame the
anger that lives in your belly.

Anger? I--

Shh,

meditate.

You have to name the anger
before you can tame it.

Open your mind.

(speaking in foreign language)

No design, no conception.

(mournful chatter)

Get all our homeboys together.

I want every gangster
we got to be in front

of my pad by 10 o'clock.

These putos wanna get crazy,

then we go to war.

If you ain't got a car to get
to my pad, then steal one.

Icemen are gonna pay for this.

 And she didn't
tell you what was going on?

No.

I think I should
go in by myself.

They'll feel less
threatened by a woman.

Are you sure you don't
want them to feel threatened?

I've done a lot of
favors for these people.

It'll be okay.

Not Father Munoz.

Oh God, thank you.

I want everybody strapped,

I want every piece we've
got on the streets.

Hordito, get me empty
bottles, lots of them,

and ten gallons of gasolina.

Hey, we don't need you here.

Don't do this Hector.

Don't do what?

Father Munoz would
be the first to say it,

let the police handle this.

Well maybe you
haven't noticed,

but his way hasn't worked.

You start a war and nobody's
gonna be safe on the street.

Not kids, old people, no one.

We didn't start nothin' lady.

What do you call blowing
up a car on Icemen's turf?

We didn't have
anything to do with that.

They were building a
bomb to blow us up with.

We had enough.

(speaking in foreign language)

Can't down us all homeboy.

I believe the lady was
tryin' to tell you somethin'.

(speaking in foreign language)

All I'm saying is wait,

wait and think.

Councilman Royce said
he set up a meeting

between you and the
Icemen on the 22nd,

that's eight days.

Yeah, we'll wait,

if they wait.

So, have you
started your training?

Don't ask.

Thanks for your call Rita.

I'm not doing this for you.

I know, thanks anyway.

Whatever you're going
to do, you better do

before the 18th of the month.

That's four days.

Hector says we
got some help now,

some people from out of town.

On the 18th he says
the Mal and the Icemen

are gonna find out what
real war is all about.

I gotta go.

(rumbling engine)

You know what I'm thinking?

If Yamata wanted to
sell a lot of weapons--

Heavy weapons, machine
guns, explosives.

If he needed cash fast,

what better way then
to start a gang war.

And sell weapons
to both sides.

It's an ugly thought.

It's ugly.

And the grisly decapitation
murder of Desiree Hobbs

at the graveside of
her brother James,

also a victim of the gang feud.

Looks like one of
your little gangbangers

got all excited and
lost their head.

Welfare check was probably late.

(venomous laugh)

God Ray, did your mother
have any children that lived?

You seen Captain Meisler?

Another lunch
downtown with brass.

I need some help finding
Hoshino's fugitive.

You remember the guy Yamata?

Yeah.

Why the hell can't
Hoe-Shine-Oh find
his own fugitive?

We think Yamata is arming the
gangs with military weapons.

In four days all hell
is gonna break loose.

Oh Jesus.

Councilman Royce
set up a meeting

with the two gang leaders,
but by then it'll be too late.

When he comes back from
Washington Monday morning,

see if he can make
it before the 18th.

If we can convince

Hector and Gamal
they're being used,

they'll help us find Yamata.

(wet hacking cough)

Personally, I think we
oughta let the savages

kill each other off.

(snarky giggle)

Ah Karen, we'll
get the word out.

Thank you.

(intense electronic music)

(clacking wood)

(pained grunts)

(speaking in foreign language)

(whistling swipes)

Feel the energy around you.

Receive those things
which cannot be seen.

Slowly Thomas, slowly.

Kata, moving meditation.

Visualize your opponent.

Feel each strike, better.

See your opponent's move

then float with him.

When he thinks
like the mountains

attack like the seas.

Oh, you mustn't go yet.

Have a drink, a
bath, a massage, huh?

Thanks anyway Boonie,

I just came to see if
you finished him off yet.

Does a killer fight like that?

The Death Touch can
be used with any style.

This is Shorin Ryu.

Don't tell Thomas, but
he was my best student.

It's our secret.

Hey, I gotta meeting
with Councilman Royce,

I'll talk to you later?

Guess you forgot,

Councilman wants to see me too.

Just give me a minute to change.

Into a what?

We have work to do.

Charles Decklin please.

Thanks, I really had
to get out of there.

Good.

Maybe after I talk
to the councilman,

we can look at those mugshots.

We covered all of that
in the last meeting.

I know, I will handle it.

Yes, yes.

(ringing beep)

Dolores, get me some
donuts, coffee, plasma.

Can I help you?

I feel like a tourist.

You don't look like a tourist.

Japanese tourists
wear dark suits,

they walk around in groups,
and they carry little cameras.

Your humor sucks.

Sucks?

That is the right
word, isn't it?

Yes, it's the right word.

Hey, make him?

The morgue.

Thomas!

(startling music)

(whistling hits)

(combustive blows)

(stifling gurgle)

(crushing snap)

(warbling hits)

(crashing blast)

You okay?

(slow grunting)

C'mon.

No!

 Trust me.

 Hoshino!

You okay?

C'mon.
Yeah.

(screeching tires)

Thanks.

He's dead, isn't he?

You oughta know.

Wait a minute, you
don't think that we?

They were pros,

we got here after.

C'mon, Gamal, you know me.

Oh yeah, I know you.

Lyin' white bitch cop.

Ku Klux Klan my ass.

It's you and Kung Fu over here.

The man's neck is broke.

And we got a call about some
trouble, I think we found it.

They're getting away.

Freeze mother fucker.

At first the Malitos
blow our people up.

It wasn't the Malitos.

Oh, that's what you say,

and now you tryin'
to tell somethin'

about some dudes
that ain't here?

C'mon Gamal, don't
go cement-head on me.

Somebody is tryin'
to start a war here.

Yeah, there's gonna
be a war alright.

Drop it!

Get out of here, hit the road.

We're gonna stay here
and chat a little bit.

 Thanks.

Sorry I was late, you
stay in touch, 'kay?

Yeah, enjoy the sunshine.

New Ice Age be comin' soon.

You tell anybody else
we were gonna be here?

 Did you?

What's that supposed to mean?

Just what I said.

Goddamned Beirut down there.

I was doing my job.

Wrong Detective,
your job is Hoshino.

Hoshino and the feds.

There's only one job
in this city right now.

If you'd skip a couple lunches
with the Old Boy Network

downtown, maybe you'd
know what's going on.

You're suspended, 10 days.

Damnit Captain, we
think Yamata is trying

to start a gang war and sell
military weapons to both sides.

A whole squad of
experienced detectives

and you're the only one
that knows about this

grand conspiracy, right?

These people are
not street gangsters,

they're pros, you can't
possibly be that dumb.

20 days.

And I even suspect you
and your Japanese friend

are on the street, I'll
put you in leg irons Ryder.

Now get the hell
out of my office.

Idiot.

30 days.

Trouble?

Yes, certain people don't
want to let me do my job.

Pig.

Good.

Concentrate on what is.

Ignore that which
does not exist.

That is the secret
of defeating ninjas.

Sure I can't get
you something Igasan.

You simply have
to learn to relax.

Just because fate
has put us here

doesn't mean I have
to be uncomfortable.

(light laugh)

I was beginning to think
even with my superior

teaching skills
would not be enough.

You've done well Thomas.

But remember, your
enemy can start fires,

he can crack boulders
with his chi.

I talked with your
father many times.

I know two nations
are at war inside you.

Two halves, to achieve the
power you need to survive,

you will have to make
peace with yourself.

Become whole.

That I cannot teach you.

I'm working on it Igasan.

I promised to meet
Karen, Detective Ryder.

Police believe that the
death of Councilman Royce

was gang related.

The councilman had just
returned from Washington

where he was working
to secure federal loans

for black-owned businesses.

Police are looking
for Hector Flores,

a member of the
Malitos street gang,

In connection with the murder.

Hi.

Hi.

Is anything wrong?

Me, no, I'm on vacation.

Alright, I shot my mouth off,

I got suspended for 30
days, I'm off the case.

You hear anything from Decklin?

He said gang activities
are outside his jurisdiction.

Gang activities?

Those guys were SWAT trained,

they were professional
terrorists.

I told him.

He said terrorists are outside
of his jurisdiction too.

I've had it.

 How bout you?

So what are you gonna do now?

I was hopin' to get
back to those mugshots.

Sweetcakes.

Perfect end to a perfect day.

Hey, 30 days babe, too bad.

I warned you about that mouth.

So what you say Tojo?

How you rike it here in
the land of the big PX.

I laugh nearly all the time.

I can think of something I
can do to lift your spirits.

What, evolve?

Can't make every
case, sweetcakes.

Sometimes you can't
make any of them.

C'mon, throw some darts with me.

All work and no play.

I could show him
how to do that,

but I hate to take
money from amateurs.

Hey my man, I think
you just got called out.

Well, well, Hoe-shine-oh.

Maybe you are good at darts,

police work don't seem
to be your strong suit.

(forced chuckles)

I can throw 10 darts, dead
center, bullseye, blindfolded.

Yee-Haw.

$20 says Hoshino can do it.

It's a Zen thing Ray,
you wouldn't understand.

He goes like into this trance.

What's the big
secret, grasshopper?

Language problem,

he wanted to know how to
say asshole in English.

Your 2O is covered.

Okay, move back, your presence
interferes with the flow.

Farther back.

Keep going.

Farther.

Keep going, to the wall, okay.

Hokkaido, Jujitsu.

Well you were right, he
couldn't do it, you won.

But, he also one.

He bet me he could make
you pee in your pants.

(raucous laughter)

Andy, drinks are on Ray.

Yes!

Let me drive.

Okay, nobody drives
Catherine the Cadillac but me.

C'mon, I've never
driven an American car.

Okay, I'll let you drive,

but stay on the right
side of the road.

Hey, that was such a cool
trick, how did you do it?

Trick? What trick?

How'd you find this place?

Someone dumped a body
here a couple years ago.

Lovely.

Yeah, it is isn't it?

Well, I suppose if you're
a body and have to get dumped

this is a pretty
good place for it.

(bright giggling)

It's pretty up here.

This suspension probably isn't

as serious as you think it is.

I screwed up, I got
personally involved.

I never met a good cop who
didn't get personally involved.

That's not the problem.

What is that supposed to mean?

Your good.

Tough, smart,

and you're beautiful.

You could have
whatever you want,

but you're not happy unless
you have to fight for it,

uphill, all the way.

Okay, you have my number.

Who are you?

Why did you move to Japan?

My mother died, I was 12 then.

Living in Cedar Rapids.

My father took me back to
his family home in Kyoto.

Because I was an (speaking
in foreign language),

half Japanese,

I had to fight almost everyday.

That was until I
met Buntoro Iga.

He taught me how to fight,
taught me how not to fight.

He taught me how to live.

And you haven't
been here since then?

My mother's father
fought in the South Pacific

during World War II.

When my grandparents found out,

she married a Japanese,

they never talked to her again.

Not when I was born, not
even when she was dying.

God,

this explains a lot.

Thomas you've got to
give yourself a break.

You were born an American.

I mean I could understand
you feeling out of place

in this country, but
America's a part of you.

I don't feel out
of place with you.

(romantic flute)

Remember, I'm still
a cop in the morning.

How can I forget?

This car is huge.

(foreboding music)

(bright chirping)

(pained moans)

(dark chanting)

Detective Ryder? Karen?

Yes Rita, I'm here.

I'm right here.

Nothing you can do.

That must've been
some dream, huh?

It was.

Look, um, about
last night, I--

Let's take the day off.

Oh, I might like that.

I might like that too much.

We wouldn't want that.

Men think they own
women after sex, and um,

nobody owns me.

You don't know what I think.

Yeah, well we'll see.

We'll see?

Mm.

Where you going?

See?

So don't tell me.

Okay fine, then I'll tell you.

I think I lost my
dad's pocket watch.

I mean I had it at the
councilman's office,

so I'll check there.

Maybe the bar?

Oh, and here's Rita's number.

She even called, she might
have some information for us.

I'll take care of it.

Okay, thank you.

I'll call you.

Igasan,

I dreamed about him.

It was no dream, he was here.

The assassin was here.

In my home.

The watch.

(light suspenseful music)

Oh Rita, no.

Put it down.

Ray!

I said put it down Karen.

Now!

My watch.

Where did you find it?

In your hand,
where you left it.

You're crazy.

Steve, what the
hell is going on?

I'm sorry Karen.

We got a tip, I can't
believe you're involved

with these gang assholes,

right up to your
pretty little ears.

(two gunshots)

Jesus Christ.

It's really very simple Karen,

your gun killed Ray,

and they're gonna
find you here with it.

Oh Ray, he talked a
great game, didn't he?

But believe it or not

he was just too clean
for his own good.

There's big money in guns Karen.

Gangs kill each other off,

and everybody's happy.

(dark chanting)

(screeching brakes)

(sensual moans)

(pained groan)

Be a good boy, and
I may let her live

a few minutes longer.

Pretty isn't she?

(pained cry)

We just got acquainted.

Kill this psycho
son-of-a-bitch.

Let her go, this is
between you and me.

Oh I could've
finished you last night

while you were asleep.

But first, I want to
take something from you.

Something you love.

Break loose Hoshino, show
me who you really are.

Hurt her, and I'll
rip your heart out.

There is nothing you can do.

No!

No.

Wait.

I'm okay, I'm okay.

Not the captain too.

God, the cops Thomas.

Yamata has the cops
on his payroll.

They killed Rita,
and they killed Ray.

(chiming bell)

Igasan, please,
she's barely breathing.

I have the knowledge,
but not the gift.

You're the only one
who can do this.

I don't know how.

You have always known.

Three fingers only.

They are the focus for the
light that flows through you.

This is the basis
for true magic.

You are a channel for the light.

Charge yourself with
the light and fire it

deep into her body,

into her spirit.

Your battle with
yourself must end now.

Let it go,

accept your own oneness.

Oh Thomas, how long?

Nearly 12 hours.

Shh.

Oh that's long.

And the 18th,

the 18th, we have to stop them.

Shh, relax,
everything's alright now.

We have to stop them.

It's alright.

She okay?

She will be.

The cops think
she killed Rita,

and that puerco Ray.

Don't believe it.

I didn't.

I'm sorry about Rita.

Found this number
in her dressing room.

Rita wanted to stop the war.

She wanted to have my son.

I ain't afraid of dyin',

It's just--

It's just sometimes
it's harder to live.

Those people you're after,

we're supposed to meet
'em at Aztecarte tomorrow.

 I know where it is.

At six a.m., that's
three hours from now.

Thank you Hector.

Hey, if you can't stop them
from selling more weapons

to the Icemen, then we're
gonna have to get some more

weapons of our own.

You hear what I'm saying?

(bleeping key tones)

I'm calling for Agent Decklin.

My people are
close by, what's up?

One of the gangs are supposed

to show up at six to make a buy.

Yamata is selling military
weapons, isn't he?

Heavy stuff.

It's all the stuff
we left in Vietnam.

He's been smuggling
out of the Philippines

and Japan for about a year now.

You coulda told me.

Huh, don't know
who you can trust.

I haven't checked
the building out yet.

(scuffling grumbles)

It's nothing personal.

Get back to loading.

Why for God's sake?

It's the oldest
reason in the world.

We're just your average cops
and feds who like to get paid.

And believe me, prejudice pays.

Black, white, Asian, Chicano.

Doesn't matter, everybody's
killing each other

for a few blocks of
crumby territory.

(racking gun)

Might take this show
on the road, you know?

Detroit, Chicago, New York,
endless possibilities.

I wanted to send
you home, you know?

But my partners, they said
specially to keep you here.

I figure they want to
deal with you personally.

(ringing hit)

Finish him.

The favor, Yamatasan.

I want to take my
time with this one.

When you beg for
death, I will kill you.

Then just for fun, I
will kill the old man.

(booming skirmish)

(resounding gunshot)

(repetitive gunfire)

(rending fabric)

(battle cries)

 Drop
the gun, right now.

Jesus, Meisler.

I was just about to drop
the net on Hoshino--

Shut up, Decklin.

I had you under
surveillance for months,

but I had to use one
of my best detectives

and I was afraid she
was gonna blow it

before I found out how many
cops you had in your pocket.

We just busted 'em
all about an hour ago.

You're the only one left.

Listen jack, if you
think I'm gonna take

this shit from you, you are--

(booming hit)

Oh I hate feds.

Read 'em their rights.

Hoshino,

first the head will swim,

then the hero die.

(hostile smack)

(weary groan)

You are improving Hoshino.

Now watch, watch what I can do.

(dark chanting)

(battle cry)

So, you have learned.

Now you think you can kill me.

But I am you Hoshino.

Wrong, I know
exactly who I am,

and you're a dead man.

(dark chanting)

(scuffling grunts)

(booming hit)

(screaming cries)

(explosive blast)

(cocking gun)

(speaking in foreign language)

(echoing gunshot)

What?

Never seen a ghost before?

He's mine!

(battling groans)

Thomas!

Look out.

(laser ring)

And there is
nothing you can do.

Dangerous, ah, this
was a piece of cake.

You wanna talk about dangerous,

you gotta talk about a
thug named Frank Guy.

Fast Frank could shoot the
eyes out of a field, 20 yards.

He was a real criminal,

but I busted him.

You ladies like a drink?

Hey, captain,
you're lookin' good.

Thomas, if you don't dance
with this woman, I will.

I do have a flight to catch.

That is hours from now.

I never really
learned how to dance.

Yeah, well I'll teach ya.

But first, um,

I think it's time
I let go of this.

I really want you to have it.

I will not forget

my American

partner.

Well, it's a small world.

I wouldn't be surprised

if we bumped into
each other some day.

Neither would I.

* Who's to say

* If the mountains will forever

Relax, dancing is
like moving meditation.

* Who's to say

* As we gaze into
the face of destiny

* There's danger here

* We must endure
this longest night

* Never fear

* Because our love is
like the Red Sun Rising

* And it's older than the ages

* Never endin' never changes

* Red Sun Rising

* Like the ocean and the shore

* We'll be joined forevermore

* I believe

* There are stars just
as far as you can see

* And I believe

* In your heart there's
a secret place for me

* Story goes

* Two ships passing in the night

* But heaven knows

* I will return just like

* The Red Sun Rising

* 'Cause it's
older than the ages

* Never ends and never changes

* Red Sun Rising

* And we will survive this night

* Because our love is like

* Red Sun Rising

* Our love was
always meant to be

* For all eternity

* Red Sun Rising

* Like the ocean and the shore

* We'll be joined forever more

* Red Sun Rising
