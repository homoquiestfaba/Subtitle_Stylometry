<i>Crashed in the south pacific.</i>

<i>48 people survived...</i>

we're all in this together, man.

<i>On a mysterious island...</i>

<i>jack!
Far from home.</i>

You think they would've come by
now. They don't know where to look.

<i>They fought for survival.
This is our island.</i>

<i>And after 108 days...</i>

i'm one of the survivors
of flight 815.

<i>Six people...
so we can go off the island?</i>

<i>Found rescue.</i>

Ladies and gentlemen-
The oceanic six.

<i>But the friends
they left behind...</i>

<i>vanished.</i>

<i>Now...</i>

jin!

<i>No!
Destiny calls.</i>

Some very bad things happened.
He wants us to come back.

<i>And the six who came home</i>

<i>Must find a way...
we have to go back!</i>

<i>To return. The island needs
you. You have to go back.</i>

Captioned by
closed captioning services, inc.

<i>The story of the survivors</i>

<i>Of oceanic flight 815</i>

<i>Has captured the imagination
of audiences around the globe.</i>

<i>And tonight, we explore
the many reasons why.</i>

I think for us
as storytellers,

What's really exciting
about the show is,

When the audience is watching
it, they have this effect of,

"What's gonna happen next
on the show?

What are they gonna do?
How are they gonna surprise us?"

Well, you can watch
"lost" and you can enjoy it.

You realize
there's a bunch of people

That crashed on an island.

They're trying to survive
and make lives for themselves.

There's kind of
an elemental quality to it.

Ultimately, anybody could
crash on an island like this,

And the idea of being
surrounded by strangers

And getting to
reinvent yourself in some way

Is sort of
readily identifiable.

I don't know your name.

I'm kate.

Jack.

Did anybody see that?
Yeah.

E island is a mysterious
place. It is its own world.

It's a polar bear. We don't
know where this island is.

We don't know how it is that they
can't be found. Hey! We've got a bar!

<i>Iteration 7-2-9...
what is that?</i>

<i>It's a distress call.</i>

It's been playing
over and over for 16 years.

Maybe they came for them.

If someone came,
why's it still playing?

The island clearly has a larger
sort of spiritual quality to it.

<i>We have
a mysterious smoke monster...</i>

that comes and goes.
Yeah, i saw it.

You might see someone
from your past that is dead.

Jack has seen his father
on t island...

dad? Christian shephard,
who died in australia.

That's him. The reappearance
of dead characters on the show

Kind of provide guidance
for our characters.

I'm not making any sense, am i? No.

That's probably because
i've been dead for 12 years.

All these characters are
sort of seeking redemption...

you're not here!
For misdeeds of their past.

I'm chasing something.
You see him?

Yes. But he's not there.

Last wk,
most of us were strangers,

But we're all here now,

<i>And god knows
how long we're gonna be here.</i>

Jack shephard is our hero.
He's a doctor.

He's kind of the guy
who most of the other castaways

Have been looking to
to kind of give them

Leadership and guidance.

If we can't live together,
we're gonna die alone.

He's not really
comfortable in this role.

I'm not a leader. And yet,
they all treat you like one.

He grew up with
th sort of tyrannical dad.

What'd i do wrong? Let's
hear it. You might wanna try

Handg out some hope
every once in a while.

And as a result,

Sort of second-Guesses
himself often.

You did a good thing.
You're taking care of everybody

And just giving us
something to count on.

The people on this island have
a second chance at their lives.

You could strip away
every aspect of your life.

If you're a lawyer
or you're a doctor,

Whatever you do
in the real world

Doesn't matter anymore on a desert
island. I wanna tell you what i did.

I don't want to know.

It doesn't matter, kate.

We should all be able
to start over.

Kate was a fugitive

Who was apprehended in australia
by a u.S. Marshal.

Don't run, kate.

So in terms of a character

<i>Who really got a chance
to start a life over,</i>

It would be hard to top kate in that
department. Is kate one of those fugitives

Where she was framed for a crime
she didn't commit?

Katherine, what did you do?
I took care of you, mom.

No. She actually blew up her dad... oh.

In a giant fireball.
So there you go.

Why do you wanna go back, kate?
If you think there's anything

Waiting for you back home
other than handcuffs,

Then you really don't know how
the world works. She is a person

Who's used to running from problems
in her life. I'm going back to e beach.

<i>What, you're leavin'? It's
very hard for her to not revert</i>

To being the person
that she was and just flee.

In about a week,
you'll find some reason

To get pissed at jack
and bounce right back to me.

She finds herself torn
between jack, our doctor,

And sawyer,
who's kind of the bad boy.

Why are you sticking up
for sawyer?

He'd never do it for you.
Because i love you.

Jack is the guy
that she should be with,

And she does
genuinely love him

And she knows that he would
take excellent care of her,

But sawyer is the guy
that she's really drawn to.

Did you tell him about you
and me? No, but he knows.

He saw us on one of those
surveillance monitors.

Well, now that
that's out of the way,

How about a little
afternoon delight?

Come on, freckles, wait!

You need me to make you a mix
tape? Yeah, why don't you do that?

Back in a flash, gorgeous.

Sawyer was a con man
before he got on flight 815.

Are you trying to con me?

And he's a con man on the island, too.
Yeah, he's a con man on the island.

There's a new sheriff in town,
boys!

Yeah.
And he's a rogue, a scalawag.

He's dangerous yet handsome yet charming.
He likes beer. He's like han solo.

He makes a lot of funny jokes. He calls people
nicknames. He has nicknames for everybody.

Hey there, sunshine.

What's your problem, jumbo tron?
Here comes dr. Giggles.

Who are you getting your orders from,
colonel kurtz? He'd call you stripy...

'cause of that shirt
you're wearing.

He'd call you necktie.
Nice.

You do this back home, too?
Steal from the dead?

You're just not lookin'
at the big picture, doc.

You're still back in
civilization. And where are you?

I'm in the wild.
They're basically stuck here

And then they begin
to explore the island...

over here. And they discover that
there's some other mysterious people

Who live on this island. Have you
seen other people on this island?

No, but i hear them...

<i>out there, in the jungle.</i>

Sayid!

Listen to me.

'Re not alone.

The show has
sort of a reputation

For being crazy and wacky
and weird and strange.

But 90% of our day is talking
about the people on the show-

What they would do,
how they would feel,

Who's fighting with who,
who has a crush on who-

And that's the part of it
that's really fulfilling for us.

I think that the reason
people like these characters

Is they e themselves in them. The show
is about the same things that life is.

It's about love.
It's about forgiveness.

It's about redemption.
It's about pain.

It's about excitement. The idea
that they have a chan at redemption

Because of where they are
on this mysterious island,

That allows us to tell,
i think,

Fairly universal stories
about the human condition.

¶

<i>When john locke
arrived on the island,</i>

<i>He finally found the place
where he truly belonged.</i>

Mallomars.
Wake up, hugo.

Huh? Time to get up.
We're gonna get going.

I thought we didn't know where
we were going, dude. We do now.

I run a school for kids

Who are extremely special,

And i have reason to believe
that you might be one of them.

John locke's entire life
has been people telling him

That he is special,
that he's meant for something.

But all that ever got him
was in a wheelchair,

In a dead-End job in a cubical.
He was a guy who was really

At sort of the low nadir
in his life.

Aah! Aah! You survived falling
eight stories out of a building.

That's a miracle, mr. Locke.
Do you believe in miracles

Nope, i don't believe
in miracles.

When he landed on this island,
he discovered he could walk.

You, come on! Get over here
and give me a hand!

Suddenly,
he's walking around,

And he's like, "this is what
everybody was talking about.

This is what i was meant for.
This is what makes me special."

What if everything
that happened here,

Happened for a reason?

Locke basically believes,
"who needs science?"

You know, "who needs
a scientific explanation?"

It's destiny.

I don't believe in destiny.

Yes, you do.
You just don't know it yet.

The island is kind of like

The worst a.A. Meeting
you could possibly imagine,

'Cause it forces you to relive
your past over and over again.

So if you were a torturer,

The island is gonna
present a situation for you

Where you get to choose
whether or not

You're gonna torture again. I served
five years in the republican guard.

Just give me
ten minutes with him.

¶

Sayid was a guy who has
tried on many occasions

To shed this very dark
sort of soul

That he has inside
of himself.

Guess you're lucky you have
a new skill set you can use.

He is carrying the burden
of having tortured people,

And that is
a very heavy burden for him.

This isn't a game, nadia.

Yet you keep playing it,
sayid,

Pretending to be something
i know you're not.

He escaped
his existence in iraq

And was on a quest to find,
uh, this woman nadia

Who he lost track of.

I've been holding on
for the past seven years

To just a thought,

A blind hope, that somewhere
she is still alive.

Is he capable of transcending
the bad guy that he once was?

That's what makes him really
compelling as a character.

I'm willing to give my life
if it means securing rescue.

I'm not giving it up
for nothing.

That idea of redemption

Is really sort of the central
thematic of the show.

He's gonna be all right.

Jack's gonna be all right. We
all are. Well, what a relief.

In a lot of ways,
hurley, i think,

Is kind of the heart
and the soul of the show.

I mean, he's this guy who's
just trying to get along

And make his way here.

And hurley, we discovered
in the first season,

Won the lottery.

But this money made him utterly miserable.
I've kind of had some bad luck, too.

Grandpa tito
died of a heart attack,

And the first house
i bought my mom burnt down.

Going to australia's
not gonna break any curse.

You need a little hope.

I have hope.

There is a dharma bus
on the island.

He decides that
getting this car running

Will really be a manifestation
of the possibility of hope.

Go!
Aah!

Son of a bitch.

The van
actually represents

A little more than just that

Because hurley finds a dead
body in the van. Bottoms up.

That's not cool, dude. That guy
had a mom... oh, and a name.

Not skeletor-
It's roger workman.

<i>It's work man,
you blockhead!</i>

He was a dharma janitor.

<i>I'm a janitor?</i>

I'm sorry, mr. Linus.

Now the dharma
initiative was on the island

Back in the '70s, early 80s.

<i>I'm dr. Edgar halliwax.
This is the orientation film...</i>

what brought
the dharma initiative

To the island,

It depends on whether or not you
believe these orientation films

<i>That our characters keep finding.
For the briefest of the moments,</i>

<i>The animal
will seem to disappear.</i>

All we really know about dharma
is what we see in the films.

The dharma initiative says
that they came to the island

To kind of make the world
a better place.

But when you look a little
closer at these hatches...

it feels like they were
into psychological experiments.

Every one of these hatches
is loaded with guns,

So they seemed to have been

A little bit more militaristic
than we originally surmised.

They set up their own
utopian society and they were

Trying to carry out
these various experiments.

But then they discovered, oh,
there's these indigenous people

On the island called
the others, or the hostiles.

<i>Okay, everyone into your
positions. The so-Called hostiles</i>

<i>Lived on the island long before
the dharma initiative.</i>

<i>And while they were
wary of outsiders,</i>

<i>They did make a few
exceptions. Are you one of them?</i>

One of who?
A hostile.

Do you even know
what that word means?

Benjamin linus has

A very sort of troubled history
with the island.

Hey! Welcome to the island, man!
Namaste. And this must be ben. Yeah.

He was a member
of the dharma initiative.

He lived amongst these people
with his father.

Happy birthday, ben.
Sorry i forgot.

It's kind of hard to celebrate
on the day you killed your mom.

Aah!

You had to come early.
Now she's gone,

<i>And i'm stuck here
on this island... with you.</i>

And that led him

To become a fairly dark
and twisted individual...

good-Bye, dad. Someone
dark and twisted enough

To basically kill his own father
in cold blood.

Ben is, in fact, complicit in
or potentially responsible

For the genocide
of all these people.

He killed
the dharma initiative.

<i>Ben emerged from this incident
as the leader of the others.</i>

You want us to, um,
go get his body?

No. Leave him out there.

<i>And when oceanic 815
crashed on the island...</i>

<i>everything for ben
was about to change,</i>

<i>Though he did everything
he could to maintain his power.</i>

Goodwin! If you run, you can
make that shore in an hour.

Ethan, get up there
to that fuselage.

There may actually
be survivors.

<i>Listen, learn,
don't get involved. Go!</i>

Whenever somebody else
comes to the island,

The others essentially,
sort of like hermit crabs,

Wipe them out
and start to use their stuff.

So they have access
to satellites,

And they live in houses and have
little book club meetings

And this submarine that
used to go between the island

And back to the real world,

So they're able to sort of leave
the island at their own will.

And they're very unhappy about
the fact that these survivors

Landed on their island.

There's an uneasy truce
that exists for a while.

<i>This is our island, and the only
reason you're living on it</i>

<i>Is 'cause we let you
live on it.</i>

But there's also
hostility and conflict.

Aah! Ben is a bad guy,
and ben has basically

Done a lot of horrible things
to further his own power.

You ever wonder what happened
to the dharma initiative, hugo?

Whoa.

There must have been
at least a hundred of 'em

Living on this island.
What happened to 'em?

<i>He did.</i>

E we're taking you to
is special. Special, huh?

You'll see things there
that you never imagined.

<i>And one can only wonder
where it all began.</i>

We know that the island's
been around for a long time

Because occasionally
we will stumble upon

The people who were here before.
Our very own adam and eve.

We find a ship
in the middle of the jungle.

How it got there,
we don't know, but we know

That it's from the 19th century.
We saw this foot of a giant statue

That was by the water
on part of the island.

It has four toes. So the idea
that there have been people

Coming to this island
for many, many years-

Why has the island been drawing
people to it all this time? We're here.

Juliet's a doctor
who lived in miami,

And she got recruited
by the others.

She thought
she was going to work

For a pharmaceutical company
in portland, oregon,

But in fact, she woke up on the
island. My name is benjamin linus.

I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

Juliet was recruited
by the others

Because she was
a fertility expert...

and one of the problems
that the others were having

Is that they couldn't
have kids on this island.

I think it happens
at conception.

There's nothing i can do about it, at
least not here. Juliet, at a certain point,

Really becomes aware
that ben is manipulating her,

And all she wants is to to get off
this is. That's not our agreement.

You need to stay here
until your work is finished.

It's impossible!
The thers keep dying.

<i>So juliet left the others
to join the survivors,</i>

<i>Seeing them
as her best chance to get home.</i>

You want
to get off this island

More than anything else
in the world.

It makes you one of us.

I want to know
about your research.

Sun... what happens to pregnant women?

They all die.

Sun and jin are
from korea. They're married.

And when we first meet them,
we assume that jin

Is this sort of
domineering husband,

And she is
the submissive wife.

But as time goes by, we realize
that sun was having an affair.

She's pregnant, and she doesn't
know, uh, if the baby is

Her husband's or this guy that
she was having the affair with.

The baby was conceived
about eight weeks ago.

You got pregnant
on the island.

It's jin's.

She comes to find out
that it was jin's,

And she eventually comes clean.
She tells him everything.

<i>While many wanted
to leave the island,</i>

<i>One survivor
had reason to stay.</i>

Don't mind them. They're all
just excited you're here.

Excited?

We've been waiting for you.

Locke is really now on
a mission to try to understand

The mysteries of this island.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

No matter how much time
you spend on the island,

You just never
get tired of this view.

We haven't been formerly
introduced. I'm richard.

Richard alpert is
the guy behind the guy.

He is an other,
a very mysterious figure,

And we have seen him
in sort of an advisory role.

There's 40 of them.

What do you think's gonna happen
when you get there?

We saw him visit john locke
when he was a very little kid.

The thing about alpert is that
he always looks the same

In all the different time
periods that we've seen him.

When word
had gotten back here

That there was a man with
a broken spine on the plane

Who could suddenly
walk again,

Well, people here began
to get very excited because that

Could only happen to someone
who was extremely special.

John locke seems to be the guy
that the island wants

To be leading. We're looking
for someone to remind us

That we're here
for more important reasons.

But ben doesn't want anyone
to think you're special, john.

Ben is told that locke
is going to be replacing him

As the leader of the island, and ben is not
happy about this. You'll understand soon enough

That there are consequences
to being chosen...

because destiny, john,

Is a fickle bitch.

<i>With ben now replaced,
locke's mission as leader</i>

<i>Was to protect the island at
all costs. Locke has basically</i>

Destroyed two ways
in which our survivors

Might get themselves
liberated from this island.

He blows up
one of the dharma stations

Which is
a communication station,

And then he blows up
the submarine,

Which is their best chance of getting
off the island. I'm sorry. Jack.

<i>Just when it seemed
all hope for rescue was lost,</i>

<i>The survivors learned
a group on a nearby freighter</i>

<i>Were trying
to reach the island.</i>

Is that like a radio?
Yes.

I've never seen equipment
this sophisticated.

You can still make it
work, right? I hope so.

<i>With rescue
finally a possibility,</i>

<i>Locke once again tried
to prevent anyone from leaving.</i>

What are you doing, john?

Put the phone down
jack is the optimist.

He goes, "oh, here's our chance.
We're gonna get off the island."

You're done keeping me
on this island.

You're not supposed
to do this.

Minkowski.

Hello?

Who is this?

I'm one of the survivors
of oceanic flight 815.

Can you get a fix
on our location?

Hell, yeah, we can!

Sit tight.

We'll be right there.

Oh!

You all right, brother?
Ah! I'm fine.

Does this hurt?

You haven't sprained it then. What
do you know about sprains anyway?

I was almost a doctor once.
Small world.

<i>Among the oceanic survivors,</i>

<i>The degrees of separation
are few.</i>

There have been
a lot of connections

Between the characters as time
has gone by, some of which

They're aware of and some
of which they aren't aware of.

But all their paths
have sort of crossed

In these strange and mysterious ways.
I fell in love with the wrong guy.

He conned me and embarrassed me.
He was a bad guy.

Some people are just
supposed to suffer.

That's why the red sox-
Will never win the series.

What the hell is that supposed to
mean? Something my father used to say.

There is this sort of
weave of life in that

These aracters that are
brought together on this island

All are linked
to each other.

I'm desmond.

Jack.

Well, good luck, brother.

See you in another life,
yeah?

Desmond shipwrecked
on this island

While he was attempting
to sail around the world

To kind of try to prove
his heroism to penny widmore,

The woman that he loves.

Desmond,
what are you running from?

I have to get my honor back.

Penny widmore's father,
charles widmore,

Is this very powerful
and imposing figure,

And he doesn't
like desmond at all.

And what makes you think
i would just run away?

Because you're a coward.

<i>I'm nna win this race, penny-
His race.</i>

And in a year, i'll be back.

The net result of being
shipwrecked on this island

Was that desmond and penny
have been separated,

And penny was searching
for desmond for a long time.

He spent
a significant amount of time

Down in this hatch pushing this button.
And when the button isn't pushed,

Cataclysmic events started
happening. I've gotta go,

And you've gotta get as far
away from here as possible.

So desmond crawled down
in that underground passage.

And when he turns this
failsafe key, all of a sudden,

There's a white flash and there
was this incredibly weird noise.

Obviously, there was
some consequence of that.

One consequence appears to be
that the island was made visible

To the outside world.

Hello? Miss widmore?
I think we found it.

Des, where are you?!

My god, penny.
Is that really you?

Yes, it's me.

I love you, penny.

I've always loved you.

I'll find you, des.
I'll come back to you.

I won't give up.
I promise.

I promise. I love you.
I love you.

The power source went dead.

Th's all we have.

For reasons that we don't quite
know, the island is invisible.

If you fly over it,
you can't see it.

You know, uh, satellites
can't take pictures of it.

So it's very difficult
to find.

<i>And then, essentially, this
freighter shows up. The freighter</i>

<i>Sent a research team
by helicopter to the island,</i>

<i>Where they were discovered
by the survivors.</i>

Who are you?
I'm here to rescue you.

Jack was hoping
that the freighter people

Really were as promised,

And so he basically
saw the freighter

As a way for our guys to get off
the island. Are we really going home?

Yeah,
we're really going home.

And locke is actually
the pessimist.

He goes, "unh-Unh, these peoe
are gonna kill us.

They're gonna wipe us out." If you
wanna live, you need to come with me.

No one's going anywhere
with you, john.

What are you doing?

Same thing
i've always done, kate.

Survivin'.

You should
go with him, kate.

You serious?
I don't trust locke.

Can you get aaron for me?

Yeah, i'm just...
not very good with babies.

Ohh.

You're so good with him.

The last thing i ever thought
i'd be good at is being a mom.

You know, you should
try it sometime.

Hey!

Claire littleton
was eight months pregnant

When the plane crashed

And shortly thereafter
gave birth to her son aaron.

You have a little boy!
Oh!

In her sort of
younger rebellious days,

She was in this rather bad
car accident,

And claire's mother ended up
in a vegetative state.

As a result of that event,
claire finds out

Who her real father is. I came
over because i wanted to help.

And we the audience
realize this man is in fact

Christian shephard, who also
happens to be jack's father.

I don't even know your name.
I want it to stay that way.

And now, essentially,
claire's missing.

We don't know where she is.

She saw christiashephard
in the jungle. Dad?

She left the baby behind,
and that's it.

Where's claire?

We lost her.
You what?

She just walked off
in the middle of the night.

Are you okay?

Lapidus, where's the chopper?
Where did it crash?

Crash? I put her down
safe and sound right over there.

<i>The team from the freighter
and their helicopter</i>

<i>Landed safely on the island,</i>

<i>Leaving jack
and his fellow survivors</i>

<i>To believe they were
one step closer to rescue.</i>

There are two types
of people on the freighter.

There's scientists
and then there's military guys.

And the scientists
are sort of represented

By this guy dan faraday,

A woman named charlotte lewis

And then a guy
named miles straume,

And they come first.
What's this for?

Rescuing you
and your people-

Can't really say
it's our primary objective.

And they're sort of interested
in doing experiments,

Figuring things out
about the island.

In the meantime, the military
guys are sort of moving in

With their guns
and their explosives...

and they are trying to get
benjamin linus off the island.

Get your ass out here
right now,

Or i'm gonna kill your daughter.
I'm not coming out of this house.

So if you want to kill her,
go ahead and do it.

And their mission is not
only to take out benjamin linus,

But to take out everybody else
who's on the island.

I can help you, john.
We have shared interests.

Or, at least, a common enemy. And that
would be our friends on the freighter.

Not them.
The one they work for.

This is charles widmore,

The man whose boat
is parked offshore.

What does he want?

Charles widmore
wants to exploit this island,

<i>And he'll do everything
in his power to possess it.</i>

This guy charles widmore
looms out there,

And what exactly
his relationship is

With this island,
we don't know.

We know that he has
a daughter named penny,

The long-Lost love
of our character desmond.

<i>The wreckage of oceanic flight 815 has
been found. There is this sort of wrinkle.</i>

Oceanic 815
supposedly was disvered

On the bottom of the ocean,
and everybody aboard was dead,

Which is not the truth

Because their plane
crashed on the island.

Wow, who could possibly
be responsible

For staging a conspiracy of this
magnitude? Ben basically says

It was widmore.
"He wanted everyone to think

"You guys were dead so no one
would ever find the island

And he could find it
for his own purposes."

And widmore says,
"benjamin linus is responsible

For putting the plane there, for exactly
the same reasons." I know who youre, boy.

Everything you have, you took
from me. I'm here, charles,

<i>To tell you that i'm going
to kill your daughter.</i>

You'll never find her.

That island's mine, benjamin.

It always was. It will be again.
This scenario is really bad

Because this freighter
has found the island,

And the others have been trying
to protect the island

All this time.
Locke has basically been told

That he is now the chief
of the others. Welcome home.

He's finally,
after all this time,

Ascended to
a leadership position.

So the fact that widmore
now knows where the island is

Creates this problem for them,
which is, even if they're able

To get rid of the people
on the boat,

They still have to make sure

<i>That the island can't be found
again. Locke and ben were determined</i>

<i>To secure the safety
of the island,</i>

<i>So they journeyed to a place
deep in the jungle</i>

<i>To find answers.
Hi, john.</i>

Claire?

Don't worry. I'm fine.
I'm with him.

I'm christian.

You know why i'm here?

Yeah. Do you?

Because i was chosen to be.

That's absolutely right.

How do i save the island?

Did he tell you what
we're supposed to do?

He wants us
to move the island.

Well, if you can move
the island, why didn't you just

Move it before those psychos
with guns got here?

It's a measure of last resort.
Awesome.

Hey, sayid. Listen.

We need to get these people
off this island.

<i>I can start ferrying people now. A window
of opportunity opened, and the science team</i>

<i>Began shuttling survivors
to the freighter.</i>

<i>And in the jungle, ben lured
the mercenary team into a trap.</i>

We know
that ben is a bad guy

Because this boat full
of even worse guys-

<i>They're trying to get him. I
believe you're looking for me?</i>

You send, like, 15 armed guys just to
get this little guy. To extract him.

Yeah. Yeah, but they're unsuccessful.

Thank you for coming,
richard.

He kills 'em all.
Yeah.

What was the arrangement?
They, uh, help us free you,

And we let 'em off the island. Fair
enough. The helicopter is yours.

You have
a safe journey back.

So we can go...
off the island?

That's it?

That's it.

<i>But before they could leave,</i>

<i>Jack and locke
had unfinished business.</i>

<i>You're not supposed to go home.
Then what am i supposed to do?</i>

Locke says, "jack, don't go.
This is our purpose.

It's our reason. It's our destiny," you know?
And he says, "you're nutty. You're crazy.

You've got a screw loose."
Good-Bye, john.

You're gonna have to lie.

Excuse me?

If you have to go,

Then you have to lie
about everything.

It's the only way
to protect it.

<i>It's an island, john.
No one needs to protect it.</i>

It's not an island.

It's alace
where miracles happen.

There's no such thing
as miracles.

Just wait till you see
what i'm about to do.

<i>Locke and ben descended
deep below a dharma station</i>

<i>Called the orchid.</i>

And underneath the orchid
is this mysterious wheel,

And if you turn that wheel,
that will actually

Cause the island to move
in space-Time.

Sayid! Kate!
It's good to see you, dude.

Are you okay?
I am now.

Let's go, freckles.

I've seen enough
of this rock.

<i>The moment they had hoped for
finally arrived.</i>

Let's go for a ride!

<i>They were going home.</i>

<i>But before the survivors
reached the freighter,</i>

<i>They were met
with yet another obstacle.</i>

There is this moment
in the helicopter

When they're heading
for the freighter.

The chopper is running out
of gas. It's not gonna

Make it safely to the boat.
I'd feel a hell of a lot better

If we were a few hundred
pounds lighter! Hey!

(Lindelo sawyer leans over,
he whispers

In kate's ear something-
We don't hear what it is.

And just before she realizes
what he's gonna do,

He jumps out.
Sawyer!

And that's how
he gets left behind.

And ever since that moment,

Jack has wondered,
what did he say to her?

<i>Sawyer's leap allowed his
friends to reach the freighter.</i>

<i>But when they arrived,
they quickly learned</i>

<i>The mercenary team
rigged the boat with explosives</i>

<i>That were about to blow.</i>

It's jin!

<i>Jin!</i>

What are you doing here?
Decided to take a dip.

What you celebratin'?

I'm not celebrating.

The thing about sawyer jumping
is it kind of backfires.

<i>Is that our boat?
It was.</i>

Jumping off
the chopper might just have led

To him saving his own life,
but he now thinks that jack

And kate and hurley and sayid and desmond
and the baby... they could all be dead.

Cod all be completely dead.
Yeah. The helicopter turns around,

Now starts flying towards the
island... yeah, what is that?

And then all of a sudden,
there's a giant white flash...

and the island disappears.

And all that's left are a couple
of ring waves on the water.

Now you have this helicopter
just flying around

In the middle of the ocean
with no place toand,

And the helicopter
crashes into the water.

Get the baby.

Jack? Where's desmond?

Get the baby.
I got him.

And they're screwed. They're out
in the middle of the water.

There's no way that anyone's
ever gonna find them.

Lo and behold,
there's this boat.

God almighty.
There's a boat out there!

Hey!

We're gonna have to lie.
Lie about what?

Every moment since we crashed
on the island.

You said that our plane
was discovered

On the bottom of the ocean.
Well, someone put it there-

Someone who wants everyone
to think that we're dead.

So what do you think's
gonna happen to us

When we tell them that
that wasn't our plane?

What do you think's gonna happen to the people
we left behind? Jack, we can't pull it off.

Just let me do the talking.

Ms. Widmore!

Throw them a rope! Take them
'round to the stern! Penny?

Penny!

I love you, penny,
and i'll never leave you again.

This is penny. This is
kate and-And aaron. Hi.

And jack. Jack, this is penny.
It's nice to meet you, penny.

Hi.

But we need to talk.

Why are we doing this, dude?

Because it's the only way
to keep them safe.

<i>To protect the friends
they left behind,</i>

<i>The survivors agreed to lie.</i>

<i>You sure about this,
brother? Are you sure?</i>

As long as i've got penny,
i'll be fine.

Then i'll see you in
another life, brother. Aye.

<i>And so began
their long journey home,</i>

<i>Where the life
that awaited them</i>

<i>Was not what they'd hoped fo</i>

Six of them came back
to civilization.

They are jack, kate, hurley,

Sayid, sun and baby aaron.

These people who will be known
as the "oceanic six"

Decide to lie. We were in
the water for over a day

Before the current took us in.
By then,

There was only eight of us left.

They wanna
protect everybody

That was left on the island.
So they go along with this lie,

And this becomes a part of their
cover story. Is it poible there are

Any other survivors from the crash
yet to be discoved? No. Absolutely not.

They quickly discover that
they really didn't have much

In the way of lives
back in the real world.

There was this sort of
gnawing feeling

That maybe
they made a mistake,

Maybe they shouldn't have left
the island in the first place.

Hey, how's everybody doing?
What are you talking about?

Building a fire or hunting
boars? They have survivors' guilt,

And that makes them pretty
miserable. She looks just like jin.

Yes, she does.

Sun's in kind of
a tragic place

Because she's back
in the real world,

And she's kind of living in-
With the tragedy of believing

That her husband died
in this freighter explosion.

She has a daughter,
and she's not really that able

To move on with her life because
she's so distraught and angry

Over the circumstances
of his death.

<i>The last time we saw her,</i>

She was actually having
this sort of secret meeting

With charles widmore, who,
last we checked, was a bad guy.

You and i have
common interests.

When you're ready
to discuss them, call me.

As you know, we're not the only
ones who left the island.

We know the only other person
who's le the island,

And that's benjamin linus via
sort of unconventional means.

He basically
pushes this wheel underground

In a cavern somewhere.

He gets bathed in light,
and then suddenly he wakes up

<i>The desert in tunisia
in the middle of nowhere.</i>

<i>I just want
to bury my wife in peace.</i>

Mr. Jarrah?

There's a woman outside.
She says she knows you,

But she wasn't on
the list of family members.

When the oceanic six are finally
rescued and discovered,

The love of his life,
this woman named nadia,

Is there to greet sayid.

And they finally get to pick up
where they left off,

And they're married.

Unfortunately, this marriage
does not last long

Because nadia dies
in an accident.

Benjamin linus comes to sayid
and tells him,

"This was no accident.
Your wife was murdered."

Why would these people
want to murder her?

And he gives sayid
a list of names,

Sort of this vast consortium
of men

Who-Who might or might not
work for charles widmore.

Since that time,

Sayid has spent all of his time
exacting vengeance

By killing anybody who
benjamin linus tells him to.

I have another name for you.

Who's next?
That's acting out.

That's what i would do if i were
feeling guilty. I just killed a man

Who's been perched outside
this facility for the last week.

I want you to come with me.
We're not going back, are we

No, just somewhere safe.

I don't think
we did the right thing, jack.

I think it wants us
to come back. Hurley...

<i>and it's gonna do everythingt can
We're never going back!</i>

There's a strong
moral streak in hurley.

He's not really
very comfortable

With the idea that
they are telling this lie

And they've left these other
people behind on the island.

And since he's gotten
off the island,

He starts to see dead people.
Help!

What the hell
is wrong with you?

And this makes hurley, uh,
basically freak out,

And he gets himself
thrown into the nuthouse

In order to avoid that.

I've been having regular
conversations with dead people.

The last thing i need now
is paranoia.

Don't move!

I
Just don't bring him back, kate.

<i>Don't you dare bring him back!</i>

Kate comes back
to civilization,

And she tries on the role
of bel a responsible person.

She's got this kid, aaron,

Who she's telling everyone
is her child

But, in fact, was actually
claire's child.

So every day, she sort of
sees the gravity... hey.

Of the lie that she's telling.

Maybe you and i could
grab some coffee together.

She starts a relationship up
with jack.

In fact,
they actually get engaged

And look like they're
gonna get married.

Of course i will. Yes.
It works for a while,

But then things
start to unravel.

She's keeping a secret
from jack.

She made a promise to sawyer
before sawyer jumped out

Of the helicopter, and she
won't tell jack what that is.

Why won't you tell me?
Because-Because he wouldn't want me to.

But he's not here, is he?

<i>I'm the one who's here.</i>

I'm the one who sad you.

So there's
this huge mystery

That's hanging over them,
and jack refuses to trust her.

If you have problems,
you need to figure them out,

'Cause i can't have you
like this around my son.

He just won't let it go,
and their relationship explodes.

You're not even related
to him!

About ten months ago,

I wrote what i wanted to say
at my father's funeral

On the back of a cocktail napkin
at the sydney airport.

Once jack left the island,

He finally gets to have
his father's funeral.

This australian woman
comes up to jack afterwards

And introduces herself and says,
"i knew your father.

"In fact, um, i probably
shouldn't tell you this,

But he's the father
of my daughter."

She was one of the ones who died
when your plane hit the water.

Her name was claire.

Jack is now harboring
this incredible secret.

It was emotionally devastating
for him to learn,

<i>After leaving claire behind,
that this was his half-Sister.</i>

Um, jack starts popping pills
and drinking.

He starts seeing ghosts, which is bad.
He-Yeah, which is not- That's not a good thing.

No. And he grows this
really bad beard... yeah.

Which is another sign.
Yeah, he's not a happy guy,

And i think when you see
how getting off the island

Has affected jack, maybe in fact
this reinforces the notion

That they have
a greater destiny,

And that
that destiny is on the island.

<i>Jack finally
came to this realization</i>

<i>Three years
after leaving the island...</i>

<i>when he learned of the death
of one of his fellow survivors.</i>

When he finds out
that locke is dead,

He's so devastated
that he tries to kill himself.

He goes and, like, gets
on a bridge and is gonna jump.

And you go, wow, why is jack
so upset that locke is dead?

I think what
he comes to realize is

They're kind of two sides
of the same coin.

In a way, they kind of
need each other,

And the island needs
both of them in a way that jack

Doesn't really understand
until that point.

He told me
that after i left island,

Some very bad things
happened.

And he told me that it was
my fault for leaving.

And he said
that i had to come back.

<i>All of you have to go back.</i>

We're gonna have
to bring him, too.

The journey for the oceanic six
is gonna be,

How do we actually get back to this
place? This island was very hard to find

Before any shenanigans
were pulled.

Now the island
is completely gone.

So even if you wanted
to get back to it,

It'd be enormously difficult.
Meanwhile, the question is

What hpened to the people
who were left behind?

I mean, the island disappeared
in a big flash of white ght.

Where did they go,
and what are the consequences

Of that flash
of white light?

We've basically spent five years
with these people now.

What's cool to us
about season five

Is that the show's
finding a new gear.

It's starting
to slip into that mode

Of answering more questions
than it's asking.

We really get the sense
that the characters

Are moving toward something. Yeah,
there's a mythology to "lost,"

But each season of the show
is a book,

And this book has its own
particular characteristics.

And there's some really great
adventure storytelling

In this season that the audience
is gonna really love.

We made a mistake.

We... were not supposed
to leave.

Yes, we were.

We have to go back, kate.

We have to go back!
