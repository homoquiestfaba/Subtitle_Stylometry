What do you want?

I want him.

I want him back.

I want him back!

Aah!

Oh!

Oh, no! No! Aah!

Aah!

Oh!

Open the door, Paige.

I know you're in there.

I know you're in there.

Come on, Paige, open the door.

Please open the door!

Open up, Paige!

Open up!

OK, Paige.

I'm gonna come in.

I'm gonna come in.

I'm coming in!

Aaaaaaah!

Hey, Paige.

Paige, it's Janice.

You gonna talk?

Paige?!

Please, please. I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry. Please, please.

Please. I'm so sorry.

Yeah, I'm sorry, Paige.

I'm sorry, too.

Aah!

Paige.

Paige. Paige!

Aaaaaah!

Aah!

What do I do with this?

Ohhh!

No, no!

Aah!

Hello? Hello?

Please help me.

Please help me.

Somebody's in my...in my house,

and she's...

No, she's still here.

I don't know.

Plea...um, uh, at

1134 Fairway Drive.

Please.

I don't know. She shot me.

Please. Please.

I'm gonna...

How you doing?

OK. How are you?

Can't complain.

Something I can help you with?

Well, uh...

I...I don't know.

I'm not sure what I'm looking

for.

Well, I reckon it's a gun or

you wouldn't be here.

Yeah, I guess.

Did you have something in

mind?

No, not really.

Uh, know anything about guns?

No.

Well, let's see.

Ah.

This here is a stainless-steel

.38 special, and it holds six

rounds.

Ooh, it's heavy.

Aw, it's not too bad.

Ever fired a gun before?

No, sir.

Well, this one's just perfect

for you, then.

Not much kick to it, which is

good for a lady.

And it's a revolver, so you

don't have to worry about it

ever jamming.

Hold it up.

How's it feel?

Good, I guess.

<i>You should never buy a gun</i>

unless it feels just right in

your hands.

Yeah, it feels good.

How much does it cost?

Oh, I could do, say...

$150.

OK. Uh...

Don't I have to wait a couple of

days or so?

Nope, not no more.

Just got to do a background

check.

It takes five minutes.

Oh.

Uh, didn't ever kill anyone,

did you?

No.

You just fill out these

forms.

I'll get you rung up down here.

Okey-dokey.

See you later, Janice.

Mrs.Trimble.

Uh, yes.

I was saying I wanted to

thank you and your son for

coming down here today.

Uh-huh.

I think we can all agree we'd

like to put this whole ordeal

behind us as quickly and

painlessly as possible.

After an extensive review of the

police report, as well as

ms. Alexander's deposition, we

have come up with terms that we

feel are both fair and

beneficial for all parties

concerned.

It is clear ms. Alexander has

feelings for your son, despite

his terrible actions, and is

truly concerned for his

well-being.

Therefore, the state would be

willing to drop all criminal

charges on the condition he

undergo a full psychiatric

evaluation at the state

hospital, the result of which

would determine the type of

therapy he requires and,

ultimately, the possible need

for long-term inpatient care.

I will tell you that I have had

a brief discussion with

Dr.Khamis at the state

hospital, and he's informed me

that based on past patients with

your son's condition, most have

required a minimum therapeutic

rehabilitation of three to five years.

Of course, some can take longer.

Others even become permanent residents.

It all just depends on

individual progress.

This is the only offer I will be
presenting to the judge.

I'm confident that he will agree

that your son is a threat to

both himself and others.

Therefore, an evaluation of this

kind is not only recommended,

but it will be deemed mandatory.

We will step out now and give

you a moment to confer with your counsel.

Well?

I will not let them put my
son in a crazy-people hospital.

Is there something else you can say?

Something you can do?

What would you like me to say?

That he didn't do it.

That they're wrong.

That that little...

That girl is lying.

Mrs.Trimble, we have to look
at the facts, and what the facts

are saying is that we can't win this case.

The evidence against Jakob is considerable.

She has his skin underneath her
fingernails, scratch marks on

his chest, bruises, traces of
his semen found inside of her.

Your son has a disability that makes
him prone to random acts of aggression.

Now, it's her word against his,

and he can't speak.

I don't...I don't care.

He didn't do it!

I know my boy would never do that.

And I will not let them put him

in a place with...for people
like that.

No!

Well, it's not your decision.

Your boy is not a minor...he's
an adult.

He can be tried as one.

I am his court-appointed
attorney, not yours.

I have to look out for his best interests.

And it's...it's my professional
opinion that...this is our best

course of action.

Oh, god.

I don't need your permission.

I'm sorry, but I am going to
agree to these terms.

It's OK.

It's OK, Jakob.

It's OK.

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

shh, shh, shh, shh.

Oh, god.

Jakob.

Oh, baby. Jakob!

I love you!

Let him go.

He doesn't like to be touched.

He doesn't like to be touched!

I love you! I love you, Jakob!

I love you.

Oh, no!

Oh, my...

Oh.

Hello?

Janice, it's me.

Oh, Charles.

You're not still at home, are you?

I mean, I have to be in the prosecutor's office in

...in less than an hour.

Yeah. I'm sorry, um, but I

don't think I'm gonna be able to drive you today.

What? Why?

Charles, I don't think I can...

I can do this by myself.

Yeah, uh, I'm sorry.
W-what I'm saying is...I...I

don't think I'm gonna be able to
come around anymore...at all.

Look...I...I know this isn't the
best time.

I've been married twice, and I got my own kids.

They've all grown up one way or

the other, and I'm done with all that.

I just...I can't deal with
another, not at my age.

I don't want to, especially one with so much...

Aw, hell.

You don't mean...you don't

mean that, do you, Charles?

Charles, I can't believe

you're...you're saying this to

me right now.
I mean, you just can't.

Well, there's no difference
if it happened now or later.

I think we both know that this wasn't gonna last.

Let's just be happy we had some
good times together.

Oh, Charles, now, please.

I...I

now, I got to go.

Charles.
You take care there.

Charles.

Charles?!

Charles, wait!

Charles!!

Aah!

Jakob.

Jakob, get away from the window.

Get away from the window, Jake.

We have to...come help me with
the bag.

We have to go.

Jakob, come on.
Help me with the bag.

We have to get going.

It's time to go.

Oh, Jakob.

Come on, Jakob.
Jakob, come on. Let's go.

Come on, son!

Look at mommy. Let's go.

Jakob.

Jakob!

It's your mother calling you.
Come on!

We have to go.

Um...

Can I help you?

It's OK.

It's oh...you're OK.

You'll be fine, Jakob.

Jakob.

Here you go.

Thanks for lunch.
It was really nice.

You're welcome.

Wouldn't you like to come in

for a few minutes?

Um...

You know what?

I better not.
I got a lot of things I got to

get done today.

Mm-hmm.
Well, thanks.

Oh!

Oh! What is it, Paige?
What happened?

Don't touch me!

Oh! Jakob!

Oh, my god! Jakob!

Jakob. Jakob?

Jakob, where are you?

Jakob. Jakob!

Jake! Oh, my baby!

My baby. Oh.

Aah!

Shh. Oh. Oh, my baby.

OK, I'll be right out with

that.

Y'all still working on these?

No, go ahead.

No. Thank you.

So, how was everything?

Well, it was very good.
I just love that chicken salad.

Oh, yeah, it's one of my favorites, too.

Any dessert today?

Well, I was kind of...

No, that's OK.

I was kind of eying that
chocolate cake over there.

Maybe we could share it.

Chocolate cake?

Are you sure nothing for you, hon?

Yeah.

All right.

I'll be right back with that.
Thank you.

You OK?

You've been awful quiet over there today.

Oh, no, I'm - I'm fine.

I just...I was hungry, I guess,

and...well, I...I don't know.

Um...

Eh, never mind.

You sure?

Yeah, yeah.
Nothing to worry about.

OK.

Well, I'd just like to say

thanks again for yet another great meal.

And I was thinking that maybe...

Hold the thought.

I...the little boys' room is
calling.

Here you go.

Enjoy.

Thank you. It looks good.

Mmm.

Mmm. Try some.
Nah.

All right, Janice...

I'm gonna ask you something.

Now, I hope you don't take this the wrong way.

OK. OK.

Have you ever given any
thought...to the idea of maybe

putting Jakob into some kind of...I don't know

...care facility?

Why would you ever ask me something like that?

Well, I know it can't be easy

on you having someone like that around.

"Someone like that"?

He's my son.

Yeah, and before you know it,
he's gonna be 30 years old.

I mean, how long do you think

you can keep it up, taking care of him?

As long as he needs me.

That's exactly what I'm getting at.

He's gonna need you forever.

And I just thought, wouldn't it

be easier to...

It's not about being easier.

I don't think I want to talk

about this anymore.

That's fair enough.

He's your boy.

He's my boy.

Try the cake.
How is it?

It's pretty good.
It's pretty good.

You look really nice, honey.

You're gonna be meeting mommy's
new friend tonight.

So...let's try to have a good

time, OK, Jakob?

OK?

Oh. That's him.

Oh. Oh, come on.

Come on, Jakob.

Shh. It's good.

Sit down over here.

It's mommy's friend. OK.

Just a sec.

Hey, there.

Hi.

Come on in. Come in.

Oh, I finally get to see your

house on the inside.

It's nice.
It's homey.

And this must be Jakob.

How you doing there, buddy?

Did your mom tell you that I got

a boy about your same age?

So, he really doesn't say

anything ever?

No.
Well, what does he...what

does he do?

Does he do anything?

Charles.
Shit, I don't know.

Uh, he's a good boy.

He's just...

He's a - he's a good boy.

Well, regardless, it's...

It's good to finally meet you, Jakob.

He doesn't really like being touched.

Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

Uh, would you like some coffee?

I have some made up in the kitchen.

I'd love some. Black, please.

OK. Just have a seat there.

Um, you two can get better acquainted.

Oh. Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

How are you two getting along?

Oh, just fine.
In fact, I was just getting

ready to tell Jake here about
the time, uh, my buddy Rico

flipped his 18-wheeler on
interstate 80 back in '91.

Oh! That sounds fun.

Yeah, um...I was about 5

miles out from the accident when

I get an alert on my C.B. from

another driver who saw the whole
thing in his rear-view.

Ooh.

So, I get there.
I'm the first on the scene.

And, you know, his trailer was demolished.

His load...about 25 cattle...
Scattered around everywhere,

some of them dead, some of them alive and

wandering off up into the hills.

There was this one poor heifer.
Listen to this.

She got it the worst.

You know, she had four broken
legs, no skin on one side of her

body, and I'm sure all kinds of
damage on the inside.

She's just howling and screaming something awful.

Jake.

Well, this state trooper
shows up, and he's a young guy,

rookie.
He decides he's gonna put the

beast down, you know, put it out of its pain.

So he takes out his gun.

He puts it right between that heifer's eyes.

Pow!

Oh-
yeah.

I'm not shitting you, this

sucker was still alive.

Shh, shh, shh.

So he shoots it again.

Bam! And again...bam!

Charles, Charles.

And the thing's rolling around
on the ground and screaming.

So he shoots it again and again and again.

And the thing is still god damn alive.

So you know what this stupid son

of a bitch does?

He takes this great big fucking...

Jakob! Jakob! Jakob!
Are you OK?!

Where is your bathroom?

Upstairs. Jakob! Oh, baby!

OK, OK!
Come on, honey, let me do that.

Let mommy help you.

Oh, it's OK.
It's...oh, I'm sorry.

Is he gonna be OK?

Um, yeah, it's just a...it's
just a small burn.

I...I just need to get it cleaned
up.

Janice, you've got your hands full here.

We'll just do this another time.
Oh, no, no, no.

The caregiver...she'll be here
any minute now.

Janice, I'm covered in hot coffee,

and he's going fucking ape-shit.

We'll do it another time.

Well, when?

I don't know.
W-we'll do lunch this week.

I'll call you.

OK, call me.

I'm just gonna let myself out.

Call me, Charles!

It's OK! It's OK!

Jakob! Damn it, stop it!

Just stop that!

Can't you see I'm trying to help you?

What is wrong with you?!

Why do you always fuck things up?

Oh, come here.
Get over here. Come over here.

Oh, baby.

Oh, you're hurt.

It's OK, though. It's OK.

Mommy's gonna make it better.

Mommy's gonna make it better,

Jakey.
No, no, no, no, babe.

There, there. It's gonna be OK, Jakob.

Look at mommy.
It's gonna be OK, Jakob.

Look at mommy.
It's gonna be OK.

It's OK.

Oh, Jakob.

I'm so sorry.

I know you...I know it wasn't
your fault.

I just wanted tonight to go better.

Oh.

Give me that.

No.
It's my turn.

Come on.

There you go.

Stop it. Ja...Jakob. Jakob.

Jakob. Jakob.

Quit it. Come on.
Jakob. Wake up.

Jakob, quit it.
Quit it.

Jakob.
Wake up.

Jakob.
Jakob.

Jakob.

Jakob.

Jakob, can you hear anything?

Jakob. Can you hear us?

Jakob.
Keep breathing for me.

Keep breathing.

Jakob, can you hear us?

Keep breathing for me.
Keep breathing, Jakob.

Keep breathing.

Hang in there, Jakob.

Just keep breathing for us, OK?

Keep breathing.

Jakob.

Jakob.

Oh, Jakob.

It...it's your mother.

You're OK.

Jakob!

Somebody! Jakob!

Somebody help! It's...

Jakob?

Jakob, are you with me?

Jakob.

Jakob, it says here that you cannot speak.

Is that correct?

I guess so.

Let me put it in a different way.

Is there any way that you can

convey to me why you think it is

that you cannot speak?

Jakob.

You know, I'm pretty familiar
with your condition, and I'm

fairly certain that you can understand me.

So, look, Jakob, you're here for
an evaluation so that we may

determine the type of care that you require.

Now, in order to do that, I need

you to participate to the best of your abilities.

Jakob. Hey, Jakob. Hey, buddy.

What this means is...I want you
to listen and try to perform a

few tasks to the best of your ability.

We'll just start at the bottom

and we'll work our way up.

Now, what I have here is a
simple puzzle which, when put

together correctly, creates a shape.

What do you think?

Jakob. Pay attention now.

Jakob.

Jakob, you want to try and put
these pieces together?

Jakob, it's OK.

Can you just try?

Jakob, mommy asked you a question.

Jakob. Jakob?

I'm talking to you.

I just need someone to come over
a few days a week, keep him busy

so I can have some time to myself.

Do you think that's something
that you could handle?

Yes, I think so.

Do you mind if I ask what's...

What his condition is?

Um, he fucks things up.

He always fucks things up.

Jakob! Don't you run away
from me, boy!

You hear me?!
Daniel, please.

Don't you fucking go near him, woman!

Daniel, please don't hit him.

You know he can't help himself.

I'm so sick of hearing that shit!

I'm sick of all of this shit!

Not my son.
My son could talk and my son was

normal, not some freakin' mute retard!

Talk, god damn it! Talk!

No, he can't, Daniel.

Daniel, Daniel!

Bullshit he can't! He won't!

Stop it!

Oh, he's gonna talk, all right.

Stop it!

Don't you go near him or I'll
knock your fucking teeth in!

You stop it!

You're gonna say something!

Oh! Oh, my god!

Oh, Jake. Jakey, are you OK?

Come on, sweetheart.
It's...it's OK.

Shh, shh, shh. Don't worry.

Come on. Jakob, it's all right.

Come on, I just need to get
you...wash it off.

Come on, Jake.

It's OK.

It's really good.

Shh.

That's it.
I'm not gonna hurt you, OK?

I'm gonna hurt you.

Hello?

Um, hi. Is this ms.Trimble?

Yes. Who's this?

Hi. My name is, um,
Paige Alexander.

I'm calling about your flier.

Oh, yes. Uh, hi.
Uh, could you hold on a sec?

Uh, OK, hi.

Hi. Is the caregiver position
still available?

Oh, yes. Uh-huh.
Where'd you see the flier?

At the school here.

Paxton?

Yes.

Uh-huh.

Are you a student there?

Uh-huh.

OK, well...

...do you want to come over for
an interview?

Sure. Now?

Yes. Is that a problem?

No. No, it isn't.

Let me get your address.
Hold on.

Hi.

Hi.

You Paige?

Yes. Hello.

OK.

Um, come on in.

Thanks.

Just come on in here and, oh,

have a seat.

Hello.

Uh, this is my son, Jakob.

Hello, Jakob. I'm Paige.

Um...Jake doesn't speak.

Oh, is this...this is who

you have, um, the flier up for.

Yes. Is that OK?

Yeah, absolutely.

I...I just...

...I think I just expected
someone a lot younger or older.

Well, disability has nothing to do with age.

Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

How old is he?

26. How old are you?

21.

Mm-hmm.

And you say you go to Paxton.

Yes, I do.
I'm a senior there, and I am a

sociology major.

Uh-huh. Our last caregiver
went to Paxton.

Oh, did they...they
graduate?

Mnh...mnh.

Just didn't work out.

Oh.

Do you have any experience in
in-home care?

Actually, no, not with
in-home care, but I do have my

CNA license.
I do that in the summers.

OK. And why are you
interested in this job now?

Um...

I, uh...I would like to be a

social worker fora
senior-living facility or

possibly a hospital.

And I'm also applying to grad
school, and I think that this

experience could be very valuable for me.

Uh-huh. Well, what I'm

looking for is for someone to

come in a few days a week, three
or four hours at a time.

I work part time, and I just
have some things I have to do.

I just need someone to be here
with him, feed him, if it's

nice out, take him outside, if it
gets late, put him to bed,

basically just be here with him

so I can have some time to myself.

OK.

So, do you think this is
something you could handle?

Yes.

Um...does anyone else take care
of him?

My sister sometimes, but it's
starting to be too much for her.

Plus, her husband just got laid
off, and they might be moving

to, uh, fort Wayne for more work.

OK.

Do you mind if I ask what is his disability?

He has anoxic brain injury.

It occurs when there's a severe

lack of oxygen to the brain.

Mm.

Jakob had an accident when he was 12.

Hit his head.
He was in a coma for a month.

When he came out, he slowly started to fade away.

I'm sorry. That's terrible.

Anyway, I don't think he'll be any trouble.

Like I said, he doesn't speak,

but he seems to understand most things.

Uh-huh, uh-huh.

See?
Mostly, he just sits there, and

he'll do what you tell him.

Just take him out once in a while.

He seems to like it outside.

Um, OK, great.

When would you like me to start?

Tomorrow.

If that's OK.

I'm pretty ready fora break.

OK.

Well, that sounds great.

I can definitely do that.

OK. Thank you, Paige.

Thank you so much.

Bye, Jakob.
I'll see you tomorrow.

OK, I'll take...

Do you need anything else?

No, I'm fine, thank you.

I could use some more coffee, please.

So, what do you know about these people?

What people?

People you're gonna be working for.

Mm...not much.

I just met them yesterday.

Well, what's he like?

He has a brain injury, so he can't talk.

Just seems really innocent.

I don't know, Paige.

I don't understand why you feel
like you have to do this.

Well, I'm gonna have to do it
at some point, considering

that's what I'm going to school for.

And, plus, it'll look really good
on my grad-school application.

I know. It's just...not the best neighborhood.

Mom.

All right, I am off.

And what do you think about all this?

She's right.
It'll be a good learning

experience, and, well, it can't
hurt her to make a little money

for next year.
Just be careful.

Don't get too involved, you
know, keep it professional.

Believe it or not, you guys,

I kind of know what I'm doing.

All right.

She knows what she's doing.
We'll see you tonight.

Bye.

Oh, hi. Come on in.

Have to finish getting ready.

Well, you look nice.
Big plans?

Actually, I have a date.

Uh, first date.

Oh, wow. Who's the lucky guy?

Oh, his name is Charles.

I met him in the parking lot where I work.

I backed my car into his shopping cart.

And I guess he liked what he
saw, and he asked me out.

Well, that's great.

I hope you guys have a really good time.

Oh. I hope so, too.

I haven't been out in such a long time.

Is he picking you up?

Yes, any minute now.
Why?

I thought I saw someone parked outside.

What?!

Why didn't you say something?

Oh.

Oh, shit! That's him!

Ooh!

Well, don't worry about anything here.

I'm sure we'll be fine.

OK, uh, he's, um, upstairs

in his bedroom.

I, uh...

OK. Do I look all right?

Good, really good.

OK. Night.

Good luck.

Hi, Jakob.

Are you hungry?

Guess I should have asked your

mom if you like pizza, huh?

Do you want some?

<i>Maybe we should play a game.</i>

<i>Yeah, let's go play a game.</i>

All right.

You want to be yellow?

And then I'll be red, OK?

Let's see.

Did you get all yellow?

Let me see.

Oh, very good.

Here you go.

All right.

All right, so, I'm gonna put in one piece.

No, you're yellow.
I'm red, Jakob, see?

All right, now I'm gonna put in

one piece, and then you're gonna
put in one piece.

OK.

Now, don't let me get four in a row.

I don't want to have four reds

next to each other.

Nice strategy there.

That's pretty good.

All right, well, let's play another round.

You know how? Here.

No. For you.

That's probably way too much.

Done?

All right. There we go.

Sorry.

OK, arms up.

Oh, my god.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Where'd you get that?

That looks like it hurts.

Here, here. Sorry.

There.

Sorry.

OK.

OK. OK.

Hi.

Hey.

How'd it go?

Great. Just great.

Ah, I really needed that.

Good.

Is he in bed?

Yeah.

Yeah, we actually had a really good night.

I ordered pizza, but he didn't
really seem to like it much.

Yeah, he doesn't like pizza real well.

Didn't you use his pecs book?

His what?

This.

You just have him put a picture
of what he wants on the cover so

you know what it is. You
didn't use this at all tonight?

No, I didn't know you had it.

Well, he doesn't speak, honey.

What'd you think we used?

Um, I don't know. But I'll
definitely use it from now on.

Um, also, I wanted to let you
know that when I was putting him

to bed, I saw a huge bruise on his side.

Yeah, that boy's always getting banged up.

He doesn't mean to be so
self-destructive.

He just can't help himself.

Nothing to get all worked up about.

All right, well, just wanted
to make sure you were aware.

Well, thank you.

Uh...good night.

See you soon.

Uh-huh.

Good night.

Hey, you are here.

Hey.

I thought you had class today.

Um, it was canceled.

Oh, well, that's nice.

What you working on?

Nothing.
Just some school stuff.

Have you eaten yet?

No, but I have to be at the

Trimbles' in about two hours, so...

Oh, well, it won't take that long.

Let's go have some lunch.

All right, I'll be right down.

OK.

This OK for you?

It's fine.

Jimmy's going to be taking care of you today.

Can I get some drinks to start with for you?

I'll have an iced tea.

Iced tea.

Did you want a sweetener?

No.

And you?

Um...diet coke.

Is Pepsi OK?

Sure.

OK.

I'll get those right out.

Thank you.

Well, this is nice. I feel
like I never see you anymore.

Mom, I see you every day.

Well, five minutes in the
morning, five minutes at night.

That's not really seeing each other.

Well, I have school and, um,

a job, so...
I know, I know.

It's just...next thing you know, you'll be

off to grad school.

We gonna talk about this now?

No. No, we're not.

We'll talk about something else.

So, how are things going with, uh, Jakob?

Really good.
Um...it's kind of hard working

with him sometimes because he can't talk.

Sometimes, it's really frustrating.

But I really feel like I'm kind
of connecting with him.

I think it's going really well.

I don't know how you do that.

It takes a special kind of person.

I think you just need patience.

So, what's she like, the mom?

She's really nice.

She's kind of strict, but I

guess you have to be?

She's kind of wrapped up with
this guy that she's seeing right now.

Really?

Is the father around at all?

No.

She hasn't really mentioned it,
either, so I can't ask her about it.

No.

Kind of feel like...

It must be...really hard not

being able to talk to people and
communicate with them.

He must feel really alone.

And he's so vulnerable.

Sometimes, I feel like I'm just
working with a 5-year-old.

And his mom is really nice.

I just feel like...if she was

more patient with him that he would understand.

Sometimes...I probably
shouldn't say anything.

She's so strict with him, you know?

I don't know.

I just wish I could be there
more or do more to help.

Here you go.
Iced tea and a diet Pepsi.

Jimmy should be right with you.

Thank you.

Honey...

This is their lives.

I know you feel like you've
spent some time with them, but

it's only been a few months. You
don't really know these people.

Now, I think your father was right.

I don't think you should get too involved.

Just do your job, get the
experience you need, and then

you'll just move on.

How are you ladies doing today?

Fine.

Sorry to keep you waiting.
Are you ready to order?

Yes.

Yes, I think so.
What can I get for you?

I will have the bolognese.

OK.

And what...what is...

Jakob. Jakob, stop it!
Just stop that!

Can't you see I'm trying to help?!

What is wrong with you?!

Why do you always have to fuck things up?!

Jakob, get over here!

Jakob, get over here!

Get over here!

You're late.
I'm sorry. My class ran over.

OK.
I have to go out for a while.

Get the door, please.

Jakob. Jakob, are you OK?

Jakob, it's me...Paige.

Jakob, it's OK.

It's OK. Shh, shh.

It's me...Paige.

It's me, OK?

It's OK. It's OK.

Come on, let's get up off the

floor, OK?
OK? Come on.

It's OK.

There you go.
You look very handsome.

Jakob...

Jakob, I need you to focus on me, OK?

Is your mom hitting you, Jakob?

Jakob, I need you to look at me,

OK?

I need to know.

Does your mom hurt you, Jakob?

Does your mom hurt you? Huh?

You can tell me.

OK.

Thank you.

OK.

All right, let's get to bed.

Come on.

OK. Good night.

I'm home now, Paige.
You can leave.

Um...I just wanted to talk

to you about something.

Yeah? What's that?

Um, it just seems like most
of the time that I take care of

Jakob, I find some kind of...bruises
or marks on him somewhere.

And tonight, on his arm, he had...

Paige, honey, I've already
told you that people with his

condition have these random fits of aggression.

Those fits, most of the time,
result in him getting banged up,

and there's really nothing you
or I or anyone can do about it,

aside from chaining the boy to a wall.

Every time I've ever watched
him, I've never once seen him

hurt himself in any way.

Just because you spend a few
hours a week with him doesn't

mean you understand everything
about his condition.

I have been living with this
shit for 15 years, and believe

me...you have no idea what it
can be like.

I understand that.
But I just...

Paige, I don't like where you're going with this.

Is there something you want to ask me?

No.

No, I...no.

I just...I really care about

him, and I hate to see him in

any kind of pain.

Well, that makes two of us.

OK.

Good night.

Adult protective services.
How can I help you?

Hi.

Um, I..I'd like to report a
possible abuse.

OK. What is your name?

Do I have to say?

No, not at this time, but we
may eventually need to know.

OK.

What can you tell me about the alleged victim?

Um...he has a condition, so

I'm not...I'm not totally sure

that he's being abused.

That's OK. I understand.
If you have a suspicion, then

you are doing the right thing by calling.

Now, what makes you think this
person is being abused?

Well, I've seen marks on them

...bruises, um, scratches
around their wrist.

OK. Have you ever actually

seen this person being physically abused?

No, not really.

OK, is there anyone else that
might have seen this happening?

I don't...I don't know.

I don't...I really don't think
so.

Do you have any idea who may
be causing the abuse?

Um...

Ma'am, I'm sorry, but these
are questions I have to ask.

I know this is scary, but I have to get
some kind of information from you.

Now, can you at least tell me the name of the person

that you believe is being abused?

Ma'am?

Hello?

Oh, hi, Paige. It's Janice.

Hey.

Look, um, the other night...

I hope you didn't take anything
I said the wrong way.

I really do appreciate all the
help you've given us.

It's just when it comes to my
Jakob, I can be real protective.

No, no. I...I understand.

Good, good.

Now, the...the reason I'm
calling, and I know it's short

notice, but Charles wants to take
me out to lunch this afternoon.

Um, is there any way you could
be here in, say, uh, an hour?

Um...

Yeah, sure.
That's fine, no problem.

Oh, OK.

Well, I need to start getting ready, then.

OK, ms. Trim...

he's in his bedroom.

That looks really nice.

Can we put this away now?

Come on.

OK. Jakob...

Jakob...look at me.

I'm gonna...

It's gonna be OK, all right?

It's gonna be OK.

I'm just gonna...

Gonna be safe now, OK?

It'll be OK now.

It's gonna be OK, OK?

It's gonna be OK.

It's OK.

It's gonna be OK.

It's gonna be OK.

Shh, shh.

Look at me, Jakob.

It's gonna be OK.
You're OK. Shh.

That's good, that's good.

It's OK. You're OK.

You're doing really well.

You're doing really well.

OK.
That's good, that's good.

I'm so sorry about this.

Just stand up with me, OK?

Come here. Come here. Come here.

OK. You're really good.
I'm so sorry.

Just one more thing, OK?
Just one more thing, and you're

gonna be safe.
Come on.

It's OK. It's OK.
Just one more thing.

I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

What is it?

Don't fucking touch me!

Where's Jakob?!

Take your bra off, please.

Arms straight out.

Turn your face to the right.

Not your body, just your head.

OK, scoot all the way down to the end of the bed.

Just try to relax, OK?

You're gonna feel my hands.
Just try and relax. Good.

All right. Hard speculum, OK?

And you're gonna feel some pressure.

Just try to relax. OK.

OK, just relax.

And I'm gonna take some samples.

You'll feel some cramping.

There's some. Just relax.

There we go.

You can come in now.

You OK? Comfortable?

Do you need anything?

OK. It's been a long day.

We'll be right downstairs, honey.

Try to get some rest.

Paige.

How's it going?

Hey. Good. Good. I'm good.

We didn't know you were back.

Yeah, I just...I just got
back.

Are you OK?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Yeah?

When we heard about what
happened, I mean...I just...

We were just wondering if you

would do another girls' night out?

It'd be a good distraction from everything.

Yeah. No, that would be...
It'd be fine.

OK.

All right.

We'll call you.

Uh, yeah, I'll call you.

Bye.

OK, well, see you later,
then...I guess.

Richmond police de...

I know you're in there.

Come on, Paige, open the door.

Open up, Paige! Open up!

Hey, look what I did.

Open the door!

Open it up!

Come on, Paige!

I'm coming in there!

I'm coming in for you!

Janice, Janice, please, I'm so sorry.

Please. I'm so sorry.

I don't care.
Janice, please.

I don't care.
I'm so sorry.

Aaaah!

Oh, my god!

This is what you deserve.

What?!

No, you stay back. Stay back!

Get away from me!

Aah!

Hello? Hello? Yes.

Yes, I...need...I need someone.

I need help.
There's somebody in my house,

and she...
No, she's still here.

No, I don't think so.

I don't think so.
Can you please help me? Please?

Um...OK.

I'm at 1134 Fairway Drive.

OK. Thank you so much.

Please hurry.
