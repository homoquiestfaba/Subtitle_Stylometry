             -Hey.              

    -What do you want, Rob?     
 -Connor wants to talk to you.  

      -Yeah, I don't think      
    that's going to happen.     

        -Everybody knows        
you're gonna come crawling back.

             <i> Slut.</i>             

       What do you want?        
         -Nothing, man.

             -Yeah.             

       -Hey, did you see        
  what I wrote on her locker?   

           -No, man..           
       -It's right here.        

           -Oh, fuck!           

         Ah! Oh, shit!

       -Go to the nurse.        

    <i> You, in my office. Now.</i>    

      Come on. Quick time.      

       -Sorry about that.       

    -Don't be. Kid's a jerk.    

 I told you if you just focused 

  you'd be in and out of here   
    by the end of the month.    

           <i> Any plans?</i>          

     -I'm leaving for Omaha     
           tomorrow.            

     My uncle owns a motel.     

    Said I could have a job     

         if I had this.         

         -Well, listen,         
      before you take off       

   I'd like to have a little    
         chat with you.         

I know this has been a difficult
   time for you and your mom.   

      But, Caleb, when you      
       walk out that door       

      there's nothing else      
       I can do for you.        

  -I wasn't expecting you to.   

   -That's not what I meant,    
             Caleb.             

   I know you're a smart kid.   

 But life is about the choices  
            we make.            

   And we have to do our best   
     to make the good ones.     

    Otherwise, we get stuck     
    living in the bad ones.     

     [police siren blaring]     

             Okay.              

    <i> Let me know how it goes</i>    
           <i> in Omaha.</i>           

        [camera chimes]         

          -Hey, guys.           

      So today's a pretty       
      exciting day for me.      

      For the final outing      

        of the Maryville        
      Paranormal Institute      

  we will be visiting the boss  
     fight of ghost houses      

           Villisca.            

  <i> As always, I will be joined</i>  

  <i> by my best friend and fellow</i> 
      <i> ghost hunter, Caleb.</i>     

     Countdown begins now.      

            Tonight.            

 The Villisca axe murder house. 

         Love you, mom.         

   -<i> You've gotta know, Jess,</i>   
     <i> in a couple of months</i>     

 <i> all this shit's gonna go away.</i>

       -It's already been       
   a couple of months, Ellie.   

          And, today,           
     while I was at school      

    two girls were watching     
           it again.            

    God, I hate this place.     

I miss you guys. I miss Chicago.

 -Well, get your ass back here  

      and stop hanging out      
         with farmers.          

        [Jess chuckles]         

    -Uh, you know, actually     

    this kind of cool thing     
  did happen today at school.   

             -Yeah?             

  -So Rob came up to me today   
          and was like          

 "Connor wants to talk to you." 

     And I just walked away     

  and he was yelling all this   
        mean shit at me.        

    And then this other kid,    
   I think his name is Caleb    

   he went up to Rob and just   

        slammed his face        
        into the locker.        

             -What?             
             -Yeah.             

        It was awesome.         

             -Yeah.             

Okay, uh, what's his last name? 

             -Um..              

           -Hirsche?            
           -Hirsche.            

      What? How did you --      

 -Facebook. Geographic search.  

     Perfect for stalking.      
  -Oh, my God, you're creepy.   

        -Wait a minute.         
             -What?             

     -He's got his address      
          on Facebook.          

             -And?              
              -<i> Go!</i>             

            [laughs]            

          -No, Ellie.           

  -Look, at least go tell him   

  to take his fucking address   
         off Facebook!          

 Jess, you're a Chicago woman.  

        Do this, bitch!         

            Come on!            

    -Okay, okay, okay, fine.    
           Whatever.            

    I'll go...to his house.     

     But if I get murdered,     
    it's totally your fault.    

     Girl, please, nothing      
     ever happens in Iowa.      

         -Give me that.         
       You can take that.       

       -Brooks Brothers?        

        Where'd you get         
    a Brooks Brothers shirt?    

         -Not this one.         

              -No.              

     Now, what time are you     
       leaving tomorrow?        

    -Around noon. Greyhound.    

           -Awesome.            

      -What, riding a bus?      

        -No, seriously.         

     Going someplace else,      
     getting out of here..      

         <i> It's awesome.</i>         

          -What's up?           

           -Nothing.

   -Oh, shit. We gotta move.    

           -For what?           
           -The tour.

 -You promised to help me pack

       -Well, me and your

This isn't even a real diploma. 

        -What are you..

    -Denny, they're not even    
       gonna give a shit        

  if we bring one more person.  

        Use your brain.

       -They're all dead.       

         [Jess scoffs]          

  Oh, I'm kind of not joking.   

   <i> Back in the day, there was</i>  
     <i> this Indian tribe here</i>    

   <i> and they called this area</i>   
          <i> "Wallisca."</i>          

    <i> They used to bury their</i>    
   <i> outcasts and their insane</i>   

     in shallow graves here     
   so they couldn't move on.

    8 people, 6 of them kids    

   got their heads smashed in   
            in 1912.            

         [eerie music]          

        -You scared yet?

        -Are you Denny?         
           -Yes, sir.           

        -Hah. I was just        
    about to give up and go.    

 -Well, I'm so glad you didn't. 

   We -- we drove all the way   
        from Maryville.         

          -Nice house.          

           -Alright.            

  Welcome to the Villisca axe   
         murder house.          

Alright. This is the, uh, foyer.

Okay, so, the murder took place 
on the night of June 9th, 1912. 

  There'd been a big gathering  

   at the Presbyterian church   
            in town.            

They called it "Children's Day".

  <i> Ever since then, this house</i>  
   <i> has been marked by an evil</i>  

 <i> greater than you can imagine.</i> 

 People just like you have seen 
          and heard..           

   Um, young lady, this way.    

Everything will make more sense 

      if we start the tour      
   from upstairs. Come along.   

    <i> It's believed the killer</i>   
       <i> entered the house</i>       

        <i> around midnight</i>        

  <i> climbed these very stairs..</i>  

         [dog barking]          

         [eerie music]          

        <i> Right. This way.</i>       

         [Greg coughs]          

    J.B. Moore was the first    
           to get it.           

          [screaming]           

   And then his wife, Sarah.    

  -Mrs. Moore was hit 35 times  
     on the top of her head     

with the blunt side of the axe. 

        <i> Totes crayballs.</i>       

     -Uh, beg your pardon?      

         Let's, uh, go          
    to the children's room.     

   It's right down this way.    

            <i> Come on.</i>           

           Follow me.           

  Herman was the oldest child,  
           he was 11.           

     Paul was the youngest,     
         he was only 4.         

    And Boyd was the middle.    

 Little Katherine Moore's room  
      was right over here.      

   All but one of the victims   

        were found flat         
       against their bed.       

  -<i> Why is the mirror covered?</i>  

       -Well, they found        
        all the mirrors         

 covered that way the next day. 

      <i> The thought is that</i>      
          <i> the murderer</i>         

     wanted to cover 'em up     
    before he began to kill.    

 -Hey. They caught the killer,  
             right?             

              -No.              

   But there was this one guy   

    a traveling Presbyterian    
           minister.            

 He confessed but was never --  

      -Reverend Lyn George      
         Jacklin Kelly.         

       I did my research.       

  We come to places like this   
         all the time.          

       <i> In his confession</i>       

  Kelly stated that he woke up  
   in the middle of the night   

 hearing windmills in his head. 

  And then he went for a walk   

       and ended up here.       

         -Okay. Thanks.         
    I'll just put this back.    

     -What happened to him?     

         -No one knows.         

    But, you guys wanna see     
  something supercool? Ha-ha.   

   We have the murder weapon.   

      Right here. Come on.      

       That, my friends,        
   is the actual axe itself.    

     A one-of-a-kind piece      
    of bloody Iowan history     

      and genuine American      
         craftsmanship.         

           -Genuine.            

     -Okay. Right this way.     

            -Caleb.             

     <i> Let me see your teeth.</i>    

             -Aah!              

         [Denny laughs]         

         -Murder boner.         

         -This is where         
 Lena and Ina Stillinger died.  

      They had been guests      
   of the Moore's that night    

      <i> due to what happened</i>     
         <i> to the power.</i>         

          -The power?           
             -<i> Yeah.</i>            

        The electricity         
       in the whole town        

       went out the night       
        of the murders.         

          -<i> True story.</i>         

That's how the Stillinger girls 
         ended up here.         

         She was found          

   in the center of the room.   

 Her underwear had been removed 

      <i> and very bad things</i>      
     <i> had been done to her.</i>     

  Let's go back to the foyer.   

        You guys excited        
        about Halloween?        

    We have a big event here    
  this year. Real moneymaker.

        -Let go off me!         

   -Didn't you see the ropes?   
         Are you blind?         

    This room is off limits!    
   -Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!    

   Hey, what's your problem?    

    -Did you touch anything?    
       -Are you serious?        

Al -- al -- alright, look, guys,
        the show's over.        

       Let's go, please.        
          -<i> Okay, okay.</i>         

  -That's the end of the tour.  

             -Okay.             

       Alright, let's go.       

         [eerie music]          

   [dog barking in distance]    

             -Fuck.             

      -Denny, the tour was      
         kind of lame.          

     You know, these things     
     are all hype anyways.      

    -<i> No, we just didn't see</i>    
        <i> the whole thing.</i>       

We didn't see the bloody clothes

         we didn't see          
    the Children's Day mask.    

    We didn't even get to go    
         in the cellar.         

       Which, apparently,       
    they take you down there    

        and, apparently,        
     it's fuckin' awesome.      

      Probably a shitload       
      of other stuff, too.      

 -Look, Denny, we can come back 
        some other time.        

 -Did you really just say that? 

   Why'd you jump the ropes?    

      -I heard something.       

            -Really?            
             -Yeah.             

It was like the sound of an old 
  record player or something.   

   -Are you fucking with me?    

      That sounds awesome.      

 Yeah, well, then grandma death 
           popped out           

 and scared the shit out of me, 
              so..              

 -She gave you like lazy eyes.  
  -It was fuckin' scary, man.   

 -Yeah. Well, I guess we should 
     get back to Maryville.     

        Finish packing.         

      Well, maybe we could      
       take our own tour.       

         Later tonight?         

             -What?             

     -Yeah, we can fucking      
           break in.            

    I mean, I didn't see any    
     alarm system. Did you?     

              -No.              
      -It's not that hard.      

 My friends and I used to break 
       into empty houses        

 and have parties all the time. 

            -Really?            
             -Yeah.             

  Most places are pretty easy   
         to break into.         

  And I bet these two fucking   
     whackos aren't coming      
       back here tonight.       

I mean, where would they sleep, 
      with the mannequins?      

         -I mean, it is         
        kind of the tour        

   you always wanted, Denny.    

             -Yes.              

  -Now we'll just have to wait  
      until it gets dark.       

      [train horn blowing]      

      [footsteps plodding]      

         [dog barking]          

       -Well, holy shit.        

             -Cool.             

         Ladies first.          

         [eerie music]          

        Okay, follow me.        

           -<i> Oh, shit.</i>          

     -<i> Oh, gosh. Watch out.</i>     

      [Jess clears throat]      

      -I'm going upstairs.      
             -Okay.             

            -<i> Weird.</i>            

          [clattering]          

 -"I survived the Villisca Axe  
     Murder House." Hm-hm.      

      -How do they come up      
        with this shit?         

              Oh.               

          -Oh, thanks.          

      -And to the Republic      

      for which it stands       

     one nation under God.      

   -You know, they added that   
         part in 1954.          

          -Which part?          

         -"Under God."          

   -Oh. And who were we under   
          before that?          

         -I don't know.         

Maybe we should ask the Moores. 

             -Ooh.              

          [clattering]          

             -Nice.             

           Oh. Geez!

  -Oh, yeah? What kind of pic?  

   Kind of like one of those    
  videos I put up.. Oh, shit!   

       <i> She's with Caleb.</i>       

     They're at that house      
          in Villisca.          

 -What, she's on a ghost tour?  
           Sad, man.            

  -You wanna go check it out?   

          -Not really.          

           -Shut up.            

           -Ow! Fuck!           

  -You got unfinished business  
    with that piece of shit.    

     -Hey, all you freakers     
           out there.           

         I'm Denny Shea         

    inside the world-famous     
   Villisca Axe Murder House    

         investigating          
      into the possibility      

       of, yeah, ghosts.        

     Of course, I'm joined      

    by Maryville Paranormal     
      Institute co-founder      

         Caleb Hirsche          

    and our newest...friend.    

        As you can see,         
 Jess is extremely overwhelmed  

by the intense spectral energies
  flowing through this house.   

    Let's cut to the chase.     

     Dowsing rods, candles      

   everything you might need    
    to light this place up.     

         [eerie music]          

   [dog barking in distance]    

   Notice the concentration,    
        intensity on her        

     beautiful young face.      

       She wants to know        
        what we all do.         

    Where are the children?     

   You should ask something.    

            Come on.            

             -Okay.             

         Ghost people..         

  ...you wanna pull my finger?  

         [Jess laughs]          

      -Dude, it's supposed      
         to be serious.         

 -No, it's supposed to be fun.  

             Denny.             
             -Oh..              

    Okay, let me try. Okay.     

          -You ask it           
     a yes or no question.      

  For these to work, you have   
   to hold these very still.    

          -I'm trying.          
   -I know. So get it right.    

             -Okay.             

             Okay.              

     Let's try to talk to..     

            ...Lena.            

    Lena, my name's Jessica.    

        Don't be afraid.        

  <i> We know something really bad</i> 
      <i> happened to you here</i>     

 <i> but we're not gonna hurt you.</i> 

    [indistinct whispering]     

         Are you there?         

    [indistinct whispering]     

How much did you pay for these? 
      -The rods are fine.       

     You're doing it wrong.     
         -No, I'm not.          

 -Don't blame her because your  
 little ghost toys are broken.  

           -<i> Fuck you.</i>          
           -Fuck you.           

       -Okay, you just --       
   -You stay out of it, okay?   

    You're not even supposed    
      to be here tonight.       

  -Sorry, I crashed your date.  

           -Fuck you.           

        At least I know         
    how to keep my pants on.    

          -Excuse me?           
        -Denny. Enough.         

             -What?             

Why are you being so protective 
  of sticky fingers over here?  

    Was your bullshit video     
          so special?           

      Yeah, even the homos      
          of Maryville          

    know all about your sad,    
         tragic story.          

       -Fuckin' asshole!        

I haven't even told my parents. 

  -Are you worried about what   
      your parents think?       

          -Of course.           
        -Mine are dead.         

             Yeah.              

  Diesel jack-knifed on I-80,   
      hit us in the back.       

       Car flipped over,        
        caught on fire.         

     My mom had to push me      
      out the back window.      

       Lucky fucking me.        

   -Yeah, she gets the story,   
    Denny. We get the story.    

 Your parents are fuckin' dead. 

             What?              

     -It wasn't your fault.     
           -Shut up.            

 -Denny! Open the door, please. 

 -What the fuck happened, man?  

   He got all fucked up, man.   

   -He made you go with him.    

           [gunshot]            

             Caleb.             
        -Shut up, Denny.        

    -You gotta listen to me.    

            -Get up!            

    -<i> Your dad was messed up.</i>   

   -Shut the fuck up, Denny!    

  You think you know anything   
      about my fuckin' dad      

    you're fuckin' clueless!    

            He was..            

       This is bullshit.        

             Fuck!              

 Fuck, it's the owners! Get up!

      -Shit, what is that?      

       -It's a mannequin.

     -Pull it out! Connor,

  -I'm sorry! I'm sorry, man!   
           You okay?            

         -Pull it out.

          -Okay. Okay.
