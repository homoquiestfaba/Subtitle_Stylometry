BILLIE: Morning. KIM
[over phone]: Hey.

Calling to check
in. How are you?

Um... well, I hooked up
with Christine last night,

and empty bed in the morning.

You know you deserve
better than this, right?

You know how much she hurt you.

Yeah, I don't know. Maybe...

Maybe something imperfect
beats being alone.

I'm not exactly flawless myself.

KIM: What is that
supposed to mean?

Um, there's not a lot of
buyers for damaged goods.

Cut that shit out
right now, alright?

Are you still doing your
memory exercises every day?

You know, just because your
mom's decline came on fast

doesn't mean the same is
gonna happen to you, right?

Yeah. I know, I know.

JAKE: Hey, you throw it back.
You sound sad.

Mommy, she won't
give me my ball.

And you sound busy.
I should let you go.

Oh, okay. I gotta go. Love you.
[Jake screaming]

I love you.

SERVER: Miss?

Sorry?

Would you like another glass?

BILLIE: No, sorry.

I'm fine for now. Thank you.

Thank you, though.

â™ª Take my time â™ª

SERVER: Hello, welcome.

ALEX: Hi.

I don't need the
menu, that's okay.

Um, could I get two glasses
of Tempranillo, please?

SERVER: Mm-hmm.
One's for me, and then one's for her.

Alright, you got it.

Thank you.

â™ª

BILLIE: Thank you.
SERVER: You're welcome.

â™ª

BILLIE: Hmm.

So do you do this a lot?

Do what?

I don't know, pick up
sad and confused women

in the farthest reaches
of Little Haiti?

Only ones as gorgeous
and interesting as you.

Oh.

Well that is... [chuckles]

It's very sweet of you.

But you don't even know me.

ALEX: I don't know you yet.


Should we go somewhere else?

For your own personal safety.

And then you can disappear.

Hey, hey.

Are you okay?

â™ª

Um, sorry.

Yeah, I-I just, I've got a lot
of... some things going on.

What do you mean? Like what?

Okay, look, I know
what you're thinking.

You're like, "What is this white
girl doing in Little Haiti,

asking me all these
personal questions?"

You know, that thought had
actually crossed my mind, yeah.

ALEX: I just... I just
wanna get to know you.

That's it.

Um...

Okay.

Well, I've been getting these
blackouts... occasionally,

and I'm starting to think

that they're becoming a
little bit more frequent.

And then when they come, I just
lose all sense of place and time,

and, uh, yeah, when
I come to, I just...

I'm left with this really
strange sense of deja vu.

â™ª

It might be hereditary.

â™ª

My mom had dementia, so, yeah.

Well, you know, I'm just, I'm
just taking all the steps I can

just to try and manage it till
we can find out some more.

â™ª

Hey.

â™ª

Thanks for telling me.

â™ª

[cell phone buzzes]


â™ª

Hey.

Should we go somewhere else?

Look, this has been
a really nice surprise,

but I do kind of have
a work thing, and...

ALEX: Okay.

I just, I-I do have
to tell you something.

[Billie chuckles]

It is very, very bad luck

to open a bottle of
wine and not finish it.

And I'm just only telling you
this for your own personal safety.

BILLIE: Really? ALEX: Mm-hmm.

Well, I'm already
feeling pretty lucky, so...

Okay, if I make it through the
night, will you call me tomorrow?

ALEX: Mm-hmm.

See you next time.

BILLIE: Okay.

â™ª

CHRISTINE: And now what
you've all been waiting for.

So, uh, Melissa?

The self-portrait of
Haitian artist, Rose Porter.


[giggles] I know, I know.

[applause continues]

Anyway, that's enough of me.

Thank you so much.

Um, eat and drink things
and, uh, look at some art.

Thank you.


Thank you.

Look at things.

[applause continues]

BILLIE: Chris.

Well, that was a
really great speech.

Bullshit. You barely
caught the end of it.

But it was incredible,
thank you so much.

BILLIE: Yeah?
Sucks to be you, yep.

Um, so, you know, I've decided that
I think schmoozing British people

might be my favorite
part of this show.

Okay, yeah, but
remember, we...

Do it for the culture.
Thank you.

Alright. Come on, go be
cute. Sell some paintings.

â™ª

Hey, I'll see you
at the after-party?

BILLIE: Yeah, I'll be there.

Hey, stop.

I know. It's...

It's a real shocker, right?

â™ª

[Billie sighs]

Chris?

CHRISTINE: Mm-hmm?

I thought we weren't
doing this anymore.

Why wouldn't we
wanna have fun anymore?

I'm Alex.

Billie.

â™ª

â™ª Take my time â™ª

Bad date?

Yeah. A no-show.

[sharp inhale] Ouch.

Yeah, never trust the Internet.

Yeah, that is what
I'm starting to think.

ALEX: Mm-hmm.

It's so much better to
meet someone in person.

â™ª

Mm, this is not
what I had before.

It's a reserve Tempranillo.

I hope you like it.

[Billie chuckles softly]

Well, thank you.

But I do have to get going.

It's just one drink, and
then you can disappear on me.

Hmm?

I guess one more
won't kill me.

â™ª

BILLIE: I'll be back.

What?

â™ª

Excuse me, Rose, it's Billie.

Hey.

Congratulations on your opening.

It was such an honor
to present your work.

Thank you so much.

That's very sweet of you to say.

Uh, but actually, I
have to be going now,

so, um, thank-thank you again.

Nice meeting you.
Um, wait, is everything okay?

ROSE: Yeah, yeah.

Can we, um...

The blackouts, the headaches,
they're only getting worse, right?

You know about my...

How-how can you know about
my illness? ROSE: Listen.

â™ª

Just try to remember.

Just try.

Rose, hi. I'm so sorry,
I've been neglecting you.

Can I get you something
to eat or drink or...

ROSE: No. Uh...
CHRISTINE: Are you sure?

ROSE: I was actually
just leaving.

CHRISTINE: Are you sure?
Thank you so much, yes.

CHRISTINE: It was lovely to see you.
Thank you.

What the fuck was that?

â™ª


â™ª

â™ª

You know what's crazy?

Like, I know we just met,
but I feel like I know you.

Maybe we knew each
other in a past life.

BILLIE: Oh.

Okay.

I like that.

I think that means that we can skip
past all of this bullshit small talk

and just get straight
to the good stuff.

ALEX: Hmm.

I'm sorry, this
is... Is this too much?

No, - It's just
like, we just met

and I'm already unpacking
all of my baggage.

It's...
No, no, it's good.

I like it.

Really?
Yes, I wanna know you.

Good.

Okay. Well, in that case,

it's your turn to overshare.

ALEX: Oof, okay. [chuckles]

What do you wanna know?

Ooh, I know.

What was your childhood like?

My childhood
was... complicated.

Um...

My parents wanted me to
be perfect. [chuckles]

Like, if I didn't get straight
A's, I didn't get dinner,

or if my room was messy,

my parents would lock me in
my room until it was spotless.

Damn, I'm so sorry that your
parents wouldn't let you mess up.

[Alex chuckles]

You know what?

I happen to think that
messy is pretty sexy.

â™ª Slow ambient music playing â™ª

â™ª

Shit.

Um...

This has been really,
really incredible,

but I'm-I'm late for this thing,
and it's pretty important.

I'm sorry.

â™ª

Yeah, that's fine.

See you next time.

Wait, do you wanna come
to this work party with me?

Like, I don't know if you like
art at all, but if you do,

I can promise you're gonna see
some really stunning pieces.

â™ª

Oh, God.

Impromptu plus-one
invite's too much, right?

No. Yes, I wanna come.

I wanna come. I didn't
think you were gonna ask me.

Okay. Great.

Um, hey, can we get the check?

These are all by Rose Porter.

I really love her work.

She splits her time between
Little Haiti and Haiti.

Oh, wow.

It's great perspective, I think.
It's beautiful.

Hey.

Hey.

Hi.

Um, have you heard
from Christine today?

No. Why?

She didn't show up tonight.

I've been calling and
texting, and no response.

That's really strange.

She's never missed an opening.

Yeah, well, if
you talk to her,

let her know she
owes me a round.

Yeah, sure.


That was intense.

Hey. You okay? [Billie sighs]

Yeah, it's just someone MIA

who's usually pretty
responsible, so it's strange.

It's gonna be fine.

Yeah, sorry.

Show me around.

Um, yes, I would absolutely
love to show you around.

So... you put all of
this together yourself?

Well, it's a team effort.

I'm more or less the
curator role. ALEX: Mm-hmm.

So I'm the one who goes
out into the community.

Mm-hmm.
And I find rising talent.

Believe it or not,

the fine art world can
be a pretty exclusionary.

Hmm.
Surprise, surprise, so...

You know, we're just
really trying to pull up

some more seats at the table.

It's amazing.

I mean, you're amazing.

BILLIE: Come here.

â™ª Slow foreboding

ALEX: Wow.

BILLIE: Isn't it beautiful?

I wanna go home.

a couple times

when I was younger.

You okay?

Your heart is, like, racing.

Yeah.

I just, I've been
having these nightmares.

I keep seeing myself
die over and over.

just, It's just my subconscious

freaking out about the
future or something.

ALEX: Hey.

You're fine.

You're safe.

You're here with me.

[Alex chuckles]

So I'm gonna make us
breakfast. [Billie gasps]

Oh, she cooks, too?

Oh, she cooks, and
she's very good at it.

[Alex chuckles]

Is there anything
that you're not good at?

Mm, I haven't found it yet.

[cutlery scraping]

Hey.

ALEX: Okay.

Oh, wow. Okay.

ALEX: Bon appetit.

[Alex and Billie chuckling]

[sighs] You know, I
just don't understand

how you're single, I gotta say.

[Alex scoffs]

Well, actually, I-I
was engaged for a while.

Oh, really?

ALEX: Mm-hmm.

BILLIE: Hmm.

What happened?

Well, she thought we
weren't right for each other.

BILLIE: Mm.

And then she cheated on me.

Wow.

And then I met
someone... smart

and funny and beautiful

and sweet in a way that
I really wish I could be.

Mm.

Let's just take this slow.

Oh.

I mean, I can do slow.

Good.

You know I'm only in it
for the breakfast, right?

Just wait till you
try my pancakes then.

Billie. Billie, calm down.

It's Dr. Ortiz.

You're alright.

I'm powering the machine down.

[Billie exhales]

DR. ORTIZ: It's okay. Thanks.

You suffered a concussion.

Your X-rays are fine, no
fractures or damage to the skull,

but these results,

they aren't like anything
I've observed before.

When it comes to your blackouts,

to me, it doesn't look like
typical early-onset Alzheimer's

or any obvious signs
of pre-dementia,

but it is clearly affecting
the area of your brain

involved in the experience
and perception of time.

â™ª

â™ª

Open 'em.

[Billie gasps]

Wow.

Babe.

What are these?

Ohh.

â™ª

Thank you. [chuckles]

What is this for?

I just want you to know
that, no matter what,

I'll keep your
memories safe for you,

and I'll always be here.

So what do you say?

You wanna make this official?

[Billie chuckles]

Yes.

Yeah?

BILLIE: Yes.

Cheers.

some of the night.

make it official.

Hi, baby.

Happy six months.

I am so sorry that I'm late.

It just took forever
to get our check.

ALEX: Yeah, no worries.

Looked like you guys
were having a good time.

Yes.

Well, you know, she doesn't
get to get out much,

so when she does, she
definitely turns up.

Well, must be brutal

having a hangover with a kid.


Do you have a
problem with Kim?

Why would I have
a problem with Kim?

I don't even know Kim.

I know, but it's just...

You know, I've been trying
to get you to meet her,

and you always seem to have some
kind of an attitude around it.

Sorry, you think I have
an attitude around it?

A little.

ALEX: Around what?

Around my girlfriend going out

and getting fucking
wasted with another woman,

acting like a fucking...

Sweetie?

[ringing continues]

ALEX: Hey.

[ringing fades]

BILLIE: Um...

Sorry.

I had another... moment.

It's okay, sweetie. We
were just talking about Kim.

I was saying I wanna meet her.

Oh, Kim. Yeah. Yeah, that...

I would, I would love that.

ALEX: Yeah?

Maybe this weekend.

Sure.

[Billie chuckles]

BILLIE: Don't be nervous.

ALEX: Honestly,
I'm not nervous.

BILLIE: Oh, really?

Then why did you
change three times?

I don't know. I just, I
think I'm just not like you.

You know, I'm not
good with kids.

They just like to leak
and spill and smear on me.

BILLIE: Oh. Do you
not wanna have kids?

ALEX: I-I don't
want dirt. [laughs]

KIM: Oh, thank
God you are here.

BILLIE: Hey.

Debbie from the PTA wants to get into
that whole field trip budget thing again.

No, again?

Yeah, dude.

What is this?

Oh, I have no idea.

I don't know, I must have just
scraped it and didn't notice.

This is for Jake.

Ooh, and this is for us.

You must be Alex,
and, uh, I love you.

Let me, uh, go find some cups.

I'll be right back.
Okay.

See, I told you.
[Alex chuckles]

JAKE: Billie!

BILLIE: Hey, Jakey.

[Jake laughs]
[Billie chuckles]

Ooh.
[Jake gasps, thuds]

Oh. Aw, you're okay.
[Jake crying]

BILLIE: You got chocolate
all over your hand.

KIM: What happened?

Sorry, he just...

Poor thing, he
just kind of fell.

You're gonna be fine.

Come here. [Jake
continues crying]

He's fine. He just got
a little scared, right?

I'm gonna go and
get him cleaned up.

You two talk, alright?

There's, uh, wipes on the...

BILLIE: I got him, I got him.

Come on, Jakey, this way. JAKE

BILLIE: Let's sit this side.

So what's your secret?

Sorry?

Our girl over there is the
happiest I've ever seen her.

Oh. [laughs]

Uh, really good sex.

Huh. [chuckles]

And also, you know, I'm just,

I'm kinda looking
out for her, so...

KIM: Looking out for her how?

Well, you know, I
think she's been having

a really hard time at work,

and, you know, she's really
worried about you and Jake.

I think the stress is making
her memory a little bit worse,

so I'm just trying to
help her decompress.

Wait, worried about us how?

Uh...

Well, she said you guys are
having some money trouble.

Oh, uh, that's, uh...


Honestly, she-she
did mention that

she was thinking maybe
it'd be a good idea to

slow down your girls'
nights a little bit,

maybe so you can
save some money.

She didn't mention that to me.

ALEX: Yeah, I think
she's a little afraid

of hurting your feelings.

[chuckles] Hey.

Listen, if you
need anything at all,

please feel free to ask, okay?

You know, it's really
nice to meet you, Alex,

but, uh, excuse me, I-I
better get back to Jake.

Okay. BILLIE: High five?

Yeah. Down low?

Ooh. [laughs]

I love you.

KIM: I'll take it from here.

Oh, are you sure?

KIM: Yep.

Okay.

[kids chattering]

Is he gonna live?

Sure.

You good?

Yeah, it's...

What did you two talk about?

Uh...

Actually, she said something
really weird to me.

Oh, really? Weird how?

Well, you know, she
said she was worried

that you were getting a
little more forgetful and...

And then she said she was worried
about leaving you alone with Jake.

What?

ALEX; And then she said
something about an aide,

which I said was
completely unnecessary.

An aide?

Why would she say that?

That's-that's crazy.

I don't know, I think maybe she
just had a lot of wine or something.

I think she's just trying
to help, sweetheart.

Yeah. Um, do you wanna...

Should we go and get some cake?

Yeah, sure. Whatever you want.

Let's go.
Okay.

â™ª

â™ª

BILLIE: I used to come here
all the time with my mom.

ALEX: Really? BILLIE: Yep.

Okay, you get us
some grownup drinks.

SERVER: Ma'am, your drink.
Thank you.

Thank you. SERVER: Mm-hmm.

â™ª And when it does â™ª

Cheers.

[glasses clink]

Cheers.

â™ª Then I'll be spending â™ª

â™ª Only one lifetime â™ª

What?

It just, I don't know,
sometimes it feels like

I'm not seeing all of you.

You know everything about me.

Do I?
[softly] Trust me.

[softly] I do.

ALEX: Really?
Yeah.

â™ª Only one thing â™ª

Move in with me.

What?

I mean, we've been
dating six months.

It's practically a lifetime.

Let me think about it, okay?

Okay.

Hey, let's go
and take a photo.

Come on.
Okay.

BILLIE: Come on.
Okay.

â™ª And say we two â™ª

KIM [echoing]: Billie?


[Billie exhales]

[softly] Hey.

Where-where's Alex?

Getting coffee.

She's, uh...

DR. ORTIZ: Billie.

So you got any idea
what's going on this time?

DR. ORTIZ: I wish
I had better news.

We're definitely seeing an
acceleration of memory loss,

and the odds are that your case

is in line with your
maternal history.

However, none of your tests have
given us conclusive results.

We're doing everything we can.

ALEX: Hey.

Hey.

ALEX: What'd I miss?

BILLIE: The deterioration's
got a lot worse.

Billie, I'll come and
check in on you later.

BILLIE: Thanks.

Love you.

[Billie sighs]

[door closes]

ALEX: This isn't right.

Like, you shouldn't be here.

You should be home with me.

Like, I can take care of you.

Baby, I promise you,

if you move in with me,

everything is gonna be fine.

This... [scoffs]

I ju... I-I just need a little
bit more time to think about it.

What the fuck is
there to think about?

Sorry, I... [sighs]

[Billie sighs]

What if things
could be better?

BILLIE: Babe.

I love you, but
you can't fix this.

ALEX: But what if
I could fix it?

What if I could give you the
perfect life that you always wanted?

Wouldn't you want that?

Perfection? ALEX: Yeah.

No.

No, actually, I really
wouldn't want that.

That's not...

For me, the tough stuff,

that is what makes
a relationship real.

You know, sometimes I actually
just wish that we would fight more.

You want me to fight with you?

To what? To prove
that I love you?

No, I want you to
show me who you are.

Like, the real you.

This is who I really am.

Sometimes it feels
like you're holding back.

I'm just trying to make
things better for you.

[sighs] Could you, could
you just hand me my purse?

I have to tell work I'm
not gonna... ALEX: Yeah.

[Alex sighs]

Here.

Thanks.

[indistinct PA announcement]

What's this?

â™ª Ominous music playing â™ª

ALEX: Um...

â™ª

I'm sorry, I have to go.

Sorry, it's just, it's work.

Really? What, right now?
Yeah.

â™ª

Okay.

No, that's cool. I'll see,
maybe Kim can take me home.

Okay, great.

Hey, babe, are you sure
that everything's okay?

Yeah, it's fine, I just,
I just really have to go.

I'll call you in a bit, okay?

Okay.

[door opens]

â™ª

[door closes]

â™ª

Um, hi, can I
check out please?

Billie Jackson.

RECEPTIONIST: Yes, of course.

Here you go.

Do you wanna talk about it?

I can give you a ride,
we can grab a bite.

What were you talking about
earlier, when you mentioned Alex?

Hey, you've had a long day.

Sure we wanna go down that road?

Thank you.

Kim, don't talk to me
like a fucking child.

Talk to me like an adult.

Okay, fine.

I don't like that you're
telling Alex my business.

What? She's my partner.

Of course I'm gonna fucking
talk to her about you.

About how poor we are?

What?

KIM: Listen, I-I just
don't like that you

and your rich girlfriend are
sitting there pitying me.

Oh, my God, what are
you even talking about?

She told me what you said about not
wanting to hang out to save money.

I never said that.

[scoffs] Yeah, well, maybe
you just don't remember.

Why, what's up?
I just...

I feel like I'm losing my mind.

[sighs] Baby, it's
gonna be okay, I promise.

BILLIE: No, it's... It's not.

It's not just my memory.

It's, like, I just feel like

everything is
crumbling around me,

and... I just, I feel so alone.

ALEX: Sweetie,
I'm here for you.

I swear I'm gonna
take care of you.

I just really think that
everything would be a lot better

if we just got our own place.

What? Alex, I'm not even
calling you about that.

I don't like this pressure
that you're putting on me.

ALEX: I just think I
can really help you

through this
transition, sweetheart.

Alex, I don't need a nurse.

ALEX: I'm-I'm not
suggesting that.

I just think that you need
someone who loves you,

who can take care of you.

I need some time
to think, okay?

This is my shit, and I don't
wanna drag you into it.

Okay, well, I just hope you
figure it out before it's too late.

BILLIE: What is that
supposed to mean?

I just mean that, in your
condition, who is gonna love you?

You know, I just... This
is what girlfriends do.

Sorry, I was just worried.

I hadn't heard from you, so I just
wanted to make sure you were okay.

â™ª

Yeah, no, I'm-I'm
doing a lot better now.

Yeah? Are you sure?

â™ª

Yeah.

â™ª

Um, you know what?

Actually, I-I had
a question for you.

ALEX: Oh, yeah? What's that?

Do you know an artist
named Rose Porter?

â™ª

Wait, she's a
photographer, right?

BILLIE: Yeah, one
of our artists.

We were at her show
the night we met.

Yeah, no, I think, uh...

Yeah, I think we shot
together maybe once or twice

back when I was still modeling.

Why?

She killed herself today.

Oh, that's terrible.
BILLIE: Yeah.

Oh, sweetheart, you
know, she's an artist.

They're so unpredictable.

Alex, she didn't change
her fucking hair color.

She's dead.

â™ª

Did you know her?

I-I just said, "I think we
shot together once or twice."

Mm, sure.

What does that mean?

It means that I think
that you knew Rose Porter

better than you're saying,

and I don't understand why
you're not being honest about it.

What makes you think that?

There are pictures of
you on the Internet, Alex.

Yes, because I was in
her show, I went to it.

There's photos of
you two together.

[Alex sighs]

BILLIE: What happened
between you and Rose?

Look, I just...

I didn't wanna make it weird.

I didn't want you to get mad.

Well, now I'm fucking mad.

Just tell me, who was she?

She was my ex.

And?
And what? And nothing.

We dated, we broke up.

Look, she was in therapy, and
then she wasn't in therapy. I...

I don't know, she probably
went off her meds or something

if she slit her wrists.

She was always threatening
to hurt herself.

It was hard.

What?

â™ª

What did you just say?

Which part?

About s...
slitting her wrists.

I never... I never said that.

Yes, you did.
You just said that.

No, Alex, I didn't.

[chuckling scoff] Billie...
between the two of us,

which one of us do you
think has the better memory?

Oh, fuck you, Alex.

[Alex grunts] [Billie gasps]

Don't you ever talk
to me like that, ever.

You have no idea
what I do for you.

I swear to God, sometimes
I wish you could remember.

â™ª

Get the fuck outta my
apartment, Alex, now.

Now, get the fuck out.

â™ª

Get the fuck out.

Wait, what are you doing?

Why are you recording this?

So that this time,
we can remember.

Remember what?
The truth.

[speaking Creole]

[Rose speaking Creole]

BILLIE: Okay, okay, can
someone just tell me

what the fuck is going on?

â™ª

Have you been
having weird dreams,

flashes of memories
that feel so real,

but you-you-you can't
remember having them?

Um...
They happened.

Alex has been erasing them,

resetting the days
over and over and over.

BILLIE: What?

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª

ROSE: Have you ever
loved someone so much

you'd do anything to keep them?

Is that, is that
what this is about?

Are-are you still in
love with Alex or...

Alex left me.

I was alone, and
desperate to get her back.

I had so much heartache
and disappointment

that I fell into a dark place,
which led me to the crystal.

This crystal has the
power to reset any moment

in a person's lifetime.

[speaking Creole]

Alright, this is really crazy.

[speaking Creole]

Okay, the cuts on your
body that you can't explain,

your blood is
fueling the crystal,

and her obsession
is making it worse.

Why are you telling
me all of this?

Because I started this,
and I need to fix it.

When Alex figured out
the power in the crystal,

she almost killed me to take it.

The crystal changes you.

I did things that
I'm not proud of.

I hurt people.

And so, I know that she'll
do anything to keep you.

â™ª

â™ª

BILLIE [over laptop]: Say
that I believe any of this,

which I don't,

what can I do to stop her from
just resetting everything again?

[speaking Creole]

He said that he tried to
help you, but you ran away.

He's been trying
to watch over you.

"Sonje," it means "remember."

I mean, I didn't
understand, I didn't know.

When Alex stole the
crystal, I came to Papa Juste.

He's been helping me ever since.

[speaking Creole]

ROSE: He says I
brought in a curse.

[Papa Juste speaking Creole]

ROSE: That energy
is not Haitian.

[Papa Juste speaking Creole]

ROSE: It's blood magic.

[Papa Juste speaking Creole]

Anything you put in this box

will be protected from the
reversal of the crystal.

I began writing myself notes
every day with the dates on them.

And when the dates started
repeating, I knew she started.

I tried following
Alex, but she warned me

that if I kept interfering
in her life, she'd kill me.

[chanting spell in
foreign language]

ROSE [over laptop]: You
should be writing this down

and putting it in the box in case
she's resetting it as we speak.

You have to hurry, Billie.

Your brain can't take much more.

Too many time loops
will kill you.

Oh, my God, come

ALEX: What did I do?

You cheated on me with her.

BILLIE: No.
Yes.

No, I...

ALEX: You did.

I would, I would never do...

ALEX: Yeah.

And it turns out your weakness
is just specifically for her.

So I didn't really
have a choice.

Uh, it was the easiest thing, was
just to remove her from the equation.

No, you didn't.

I do have to admit, I
think killing that bitch

might be the only thing that I
really enjoyed about all this.

[cries] Why? Why would
you do all of this?

ALEX: Why?

[Billie sobs]

Because we're
meant to be together.

[Billie gasps]

you tell me that we're
not right for each other.

And you're wrong.

I just wanna make you happy.

I know, I know.

I just, I would make sure
I pick up one of her pieces

before she's selling out
exhibitions at the MoMA, that's all.


Anyway, that's enough from me.

Um, eat things and drink
and have a look at some art.

Enjoy yourselves.


Thank you.

[applause continues]

Hi.

Great speech.
Thank you.

That is a great dress.

New look?

BILLIE: You know,
things change.

Not everything.

But definitely this.

We're done, Christine,

and I mean it.

BILLIE [over
phone]: Don't worry.

I've moved on from all of that.

KIM [over phone]: Great, 'cause
I've got someone perfect for you.

BILLIE: Oh.

Well, thank you, but I'm good.

KIM: Wait, are you
seeing someone?

BILLIE: No, nothing serious.

I'm just keeping
my options open.
