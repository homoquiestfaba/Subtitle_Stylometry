[distant gunshot]




Jasper!

That was five bullets.

[cocks gun]

You better make
the next one count.


Son of a bitch.

Son of a bitch.

I got you pinned, boy.

Come on out.


That was your sixth bullet, son.

You're done, boy.

Yes, sir.

There was only two ways
this was gonna end,

and you choose the wrong way.

Now, turn over...

so I don't have to shoot you
in the back twice.

Who'd you cross, hmm?


I think so too.

[horse snorts]

[coyote howls]



[horse neighs]

[horse neighs]











Tick tock, tick tock.



[wind howls]


[horse snorts]

Unlucky.

[man screams]




Can I speak to
the man of the house?

Why don't you put your hands
where I can see 'em?

Both hands!

Uh, I would if I could, ma'am.

You get shot?

Ma'am, I'm a U.S. Marshal.

I'm asking you for assistance.


Marshal young as you
would get shot in the back.


[door opens]

[door closes]

You can sleep in the yard

till you're well enough
to git along.

Thank you, ma'am.
Uh-huh.

I ain't gonna try
anything funny, ma'am.

Who did that to your shoulder?

Are they still alive?

Can I trouble you
for a cup of coffee, ma'am?

Thank you, ma'am.

What are you even doing way out
here without a horse or nothin'?

Ma'am...
You can tell me or get out.

I have a right to know
who sleeps on my property.

I was taking a prisoner down
from Tanner City to Morlansburg.

He was a leader of a band of
outlaws out near Chapton ways.

He just got the drop on me
real good.

Scared my horse away.

Stole a pistol.

Shot me in the back.
I had to kill him.

Shame I had to leave his body
there though.

Man's got $5,000 on his head
and...

now he's just rotting
in the middle of the desert.

Five thousand dollars.

That's a lot of money.

That must be a real bad man
to have that much put on him.

Nah.

Just means he stole a lot of
money from the wrong person.

[door opens]

What can I get ya?

A horse and a rifle.

Sorry to be
an inconvenience, ma'am.

Should be out of here tomorrow.

Know where you're headed?

I was hoping you could
point me in the direction

of the nearest town,
if you wouldn't mind.

Just keep heading that way.

You'll hit Carsonville
in two or three days.

Is that where your husband's at?

Mm-hmm.

Well...

I can stay till your husband
gets back, if you like.

You should go
as soon as you're able.

Thank you, ma'am.

Mm-hmm. Dinner's at dusk.

Hola, compadre.

Could you help me with a drink
of water, maybe some food?

Tengo hambre.

No.

[cocks gun]

I'm not really asking.

May I?

Que Bonita pistola.

I'm gonna need that too.

You should move along.

Tell that to my friends.

Que lastima.


[cocks gun]


Survival is restraint.


I'm... I'm sorry, ma'am.

My name's Annabell,
and I'd like it if you used it.

Don't be so shy, Marshal.

I'll see you inside for coffee
in a minute.

Thank you, ma'am.

[door opens]

Good morning, Mr. Jefferies.

Your wife has been very
hospitable to me this morning.

I didn't see you when I rode in.

How was my oatmeal?

Excuse me?

You my cousin?

No, sir, I am not.

Hmm.

So we aren't related.

I just can't understand
why the hell you're in my house,

at my table, in my chair,
eating my oatmeal.

Thank you, ma'am.

It was delicious.

So what kinda badge is that?

Special Detective.

Well.

What is it exactly you,
uh, specially detect?

How did you hurt your arm,
Mr. Jefferies?

He, uh, fell
while he was working.

And the lacerations
on your wrist?

That's an awful big word,
partner.

How did you hurt your wrist?

I know what it means.

On my last drive,
a steer bolted,

dragged me clean off my horse.

Messed me up real good.

It's part of the job.

Well, I do hope
you recover soon.

Thank you.

Ma'am, do you mind if I ask you
a few questions before I go?

Like...

Like what?

[taps chair]

Have you seen any men
pass through here recently?

Talkin' 'bout the man who came
by yesterday and stole my horse?

What are you gonna
do about that, lawman?

Gonna help me get
my stolen property back?

I'd be much obliged.

Ma'am...

what did this man look like?

I don't know.
Pretty normal, I guess.

Average.

Yeah, I didn't really
get a good look at him.

What exactly did he do?

Stole a lot of money
that didn't belong to him.

That's all?

He's also killed just about
everyone who got in his way,

but that's not my concern.

So you're just trying
to get that money back then.

How much did they
get away with anyway?

Now, that's privileged
information, Mr. Jeffries.

Sent you out here.

Must've been enough to share.

That and a noose.

Rest assured,
the outlaws will hang.

Was he wounded
when he came through?

I don't know. He looked
pretty able and dangerous to me.

It's really too bad
about your injury.

Must have been hard to watch
$5,000 just ride away.

You looking for something in
that little Bible you got there?

No, I found it.

Now, that is a nice suit.

They uniform all you Pinkertons
that way?

That makes you
a special detective.

How long have you two
been married?

I think you've asked
enough questions.

How long have you two
been married?

Eight years.

Eight years,
since I was sixteen.

Eight years.

You have been married
to this man for eight years.

Yes, sir.

Look at me.

Now, just the two of you
live here?

Yes, sir.

Can you play that banjo?

No. That's my husband's.

Play it.

[cocks gun]

Play it.

I gotta tune it first.

I haven't played in a spell.


What you wanna hear?

Music.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª It takes a worried man â™ª

â™ª To sing a worried song â™ª

â™ª It takes a worried man â™ª

â™ª To sing a worried song â™ª

â™ª It takes a worried man â™ª

â™ª To sing a worried song â™ª

â™ª I'm worried now â™ª

â™ª But I won't be worried long â™ª


What direction was he riding?

He rode out into the valley.

No way to know what way
he was headed after that.

Thank you for welcoming me
into your...

modest home.

It's been most useful.

It'd be all right if you want
to stay another night.

That's mighty
kind of you, ma'am.

[crow cawing]


Should've been back by now.

Figure something
happened to him?

Well, there's room
inside for you

if you'd like to get out
of the dirt for a spell.

[floorboard creaks]

[gunshot echoes]

[cocks gun]

Who the hell are you?


Where's my wife?

Dead in your bedroom.


[watch ticking]




Goddammit.


â™ªâ™ª [harmonica]


â™ªâ™ª [harmonica]

â™ªâ™ª [harmonica]

â™ªâ™ª

Hey, mister.

Now what's that you think
you're doing with my horse?

I said... what's that you think
you're doing with my horse?

I heard what you said
the first time.

You and I both know
whose property this is,

so I'm just gonna
go on about my business

and be on my way.

Is that so?

Yup.

You're outnumbered.

Yeah? Where you learn
how to count?

I said you're outnumbered!

Killian!

What?

The man's back for his horse.

What do you want me
to do about it?

I'm already making supper!

Help?

Just shoot the man!

All right, now you just
lay that in the dirt,

and you walk on outta here,
Marshal.

Go!

Goddamn son of a bitch!
He winged me!

You just signed
your death warrant, Marshal!


Goddamn marshal.

Is that all you got?

Your buckshots just itch.

What you been hunting, rabbits?

Yeah, we saw them papers
in that saddlebag.

You got posters of us,

and you ain't getting
out of here alive.

You got a poster of my face too?

Name's Jasper Mudd.

Runnin' without
my brother's gang.

Bullshit!

I ain't a marshal, boys.

I ain't looking
to turn you in either.

And that document
says I'm a marshal?

I got it off a dead man.

I got his badge too.

You sayin' you killed a marshal?

Look, my arm's shot up
real bad here.

My ankle's sprained
from running away.

I'm gonna toss you this badge
so you can see it.

Take a look at that.

Go on. Check it out.

Now, I ain't falling
for no tricks now, ya hear?

It's God's honest truth, boys.
Ain't lying.

He's lying about somethin'.

I don't care what he says.

I'm gonna keep me that horse.
All right.

Good. We can just
go our separate ways.

Just give me my horse back.

Nobody's gotta get hurt.

It's too late for that.

What the hell, Killian?

I'm sorry!
I thought you was him!

Well, open your eyes!
You gotta pay attention!

Tricky!

He's got my gun.
What?

He's got my gun.






Aah!


You got any tobacco?

I can spare a cigarette.

Was all that you said true?

Every word.

So you ain't a marshal then.

Nah, I got a bounty
on my head too.

Never did this well.

Can't expect me to start now.

What were them lawmen
after you for anyhow?

Robbed a train with my brothers.

Petty theft?

Nah. We hit an unmarked
bank car.

Ran straight into
a posse of armed guards.

It was us or them.

And they nabbed you alive?

No.

But they came lookin'.

You got any drink?

I got a sip or two left,
I reckon.

[opens flask]

It's all yours.

I can spare a bullet
if you like.

Nah.

Just let me lie here.

I'm gonna need my knife back.

I know.

Just let me finish my cigarette.

Reckon that'll be fine.

[pulls knife out]


[heavy footstep]


[cocks shotgun]

Hello, Jasper.

Kane.

Wanna turn right back around

and deal with that
furry friend of ours?

No, I'd rather do not.

Why don't you turn around?

How long you been here?
Long enough.

You kill our baby brother?

Turn...

You killed all the boys
in cold blood, Kane.

Special place in hell
for people like that.

Yeah, I'll see you there,
friend.

[cocks shotgun]

[bear growls]




Jasper!

I get you?

All right, Jasper,
come on out now!

All I want is that gold now.

And your horse.
I'm gonna take that too.

And I'll be on my way.

Look, I'm sorry about the boys.

If it makes you feel any better,

they was gonna just gonna divvy
it up and cut you out anyway.

Aw, hell.

Welcome, stranger!

Why don't you set by my fire
a minute?

I'll just be right there.

Take your time, sir.

You look pretty tough-lookin'.

I bet you got a badge on.

U.S. Marshal.
Just passin' through.

Can I buy some dinner from ya?

Shoot, I'll just give ya dinner.

Ain't takin' no more for free
in this lifetime, sir.

Oh, ho-ho-ho.

I know there's gold.

I know there's gold
right down there,

and I've been dreaming about it.

Been been dreaming about it
for a couple of weeks,

but I ain't found any.

And then you show up.

Sure this here's gold country?


Lookee here!
What do you think?

The Lord moves
in mysterious ways,

but He is never wrong.

What's a decent man
like yourself

doing out here looking for gold?

Well, you know, son,

a man's gotta do somethin'
important in his life.

You know that.

I figure the more gold we find,

then the more gold people
will have gold,

then, well, finally nobody
will be short of coin.

Understand what I mean?

So you're helping.

Well, ain't you helping?
You're a marshal.

You keep this free country safe
for us to roam about unafraid.

And I wanna tell ya
I respect the job that you do.

I do respect the job
that you do.

You know, I think maybe we're
a little bit alike, you and me.

I doubt it.

We're both moving this land
into the future.

It's a big country.

Lot of room,
but people are crowding in.

It's gonna be your job
to keep us safe.

Think you can do that, son?

Thanks for the food.
My name's Jasper.

Jasper. I'm Abner.

Abner Wilhelm.
I'm so pleased to meet ya.

[bullet whoosh]

[cocks gun]

[bullet whoosh]

[bullet whoosh]

Goddammit.

I'm done running.


Focus.

Aah!




Jasper Mudd,
you are under arrest

for the robbery
of a Carsonville Bank car,

the murder of U.S. Marshal
Denton J. Cartwright,

and his unlawful impersonation.


You gonna kill me or not?

I'd rather see you hang.

Listen!

Hey, listen to me!

You don't gotta kill me.

Listen!

You just need the gold
that's in my saddlebags.

It's real close.

Real close by.

You just grab it and go.

Nobody's gonna know
the difference.

No, no, no, no, Mr. Mudd!

You must pay for your crimes.

And you will hang by the noose
until dead.

That's not your job.

That's not your job.

I know.

No.

We wouldn't anybody
to cut you down.

Now, what was that song
you sang to me?

Something about a, um...

a worried man.

Tell me.

Are you worried now?

Best say your prayers now,
Jasper,

if you're gonna say them at all.

What?

Hmm?

I oughta kill you...

with my bare hands.

Empty threats.


[cocks gun]



I'm Marshal Denton Cartwright,

and I'm lookin' for
the local authorities.

I got a bounty I gotta turn in.

Office is just
down the road a piece.

Thank you very much.

Ain't I seen you before
somewhere?

No.
