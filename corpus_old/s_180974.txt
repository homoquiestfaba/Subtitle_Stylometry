<i>In June 1863, after more than two years</i>
<i>of bloody conflict...</i>

<i>the Confederate army of Northern</i>
<i>Virginia, Robert E. Lee commanding...</i>

<i>slips across the Potomac</i>
<i>to begin the invasion of the North.</i>

<i>It is an army of 70,000 men.</i>

<i>They move slowly behind the Blue Ridge...</i>

<i>using the mountains</i>
<i>to screen their movements.</i>

<i>Their objective is to draw</i>
<i>the Union army out into the open...</i>

<i>where it can be destroyed.</i>

<i>Late in June, the Union army</i>
<i>of the Potomac, 80,000 men...</i>

<i>turns north from Virginia to begin</i>
<i>the great pursuit up the narrow roads...</i>

<i>across Maryland and into Pennsylvania.</i>

<i>General Lee knows that a letter has been</i>
<i>prepared by the Southern government.</i>

<i>A letter which offers peace.</i>

<i>It is to be placed on the desk</i>
<i>of Abraham Lincoln, President of the U.S...</i>

<i>the day after Lee has destroyed</i>
<i>the Army of the Potomac...</i>

<i>somewhere north of Washington.</i>

Federal cavalry. Two brigades.

-Howdy, friend. Where you headed?
-General Longstreet. I must see him.

Is that a fact?

I know General Lee's headquarters
are up here a little ways.

Wherever he is, Longstreet is nearby.

-Take me that way. This is urgent.
-Let me put it to you like this, stranger.

You're not in a uniform
and you're coming through my picket line.

I'll take you up there,
but if nobody there knows you...

I guess, unfortunately,
you'll have to be hanged.

Sir. General, sir.

I'm sorry, excuse me, sir,
but Harrison is back.

-Harrison?
-Yes, sir.

The scout, Harrison, sir.

I knew you'd want to know that
as soon as possible.

He's right outside here, sir.

Your servant, General.

Didn't expect to see me, did you?

I paid you in gold three weeks ago.
What do you got?

I don't suppose you got
another one of those.

That good southern tobacco.

What do you got?

I got the position of the Yankee army.
They're only a few miles down the road.

The whole Yankee army coming this way.
Seven corps.

A few miles?

Yes. Two brigades of Yankee cavalry
down that road about...

two, four hours away.

Behind that there's seven corps.

I put it all on a map, if you'd like to see it.
About 80,000 men.

All seven corps.

You didn't know any of that, General?

You didn't know they were on the move.

You wouldn't be spread so thin
if you'd known.

How do you know we're spread out?

Listen, General. I'm good at this business.

Sir, I beg your pardon,
but if this man's story is true...

why haven't we heard about it?

General Stuart's cavalry is out there.
He would have reported.

-What do you know about Jeb Stuart?
-He's out there all right.

He's riding up north somewhere
getting his name in the papers.

He hasn't caused anything but a little fuss.

If the federal army was moving that fast,
as close as you say...

-I have to believe General Stuart--
-Now, look here.

I came within an angry mule's kick
of the whole Yankee cavalry.

And all the way through a picket line.

Hazardous, too.

I don't know what Jeb Stuart's doing.

I don't care. I do my job.

Yankee cavalry's down the road,
thick as fleas...

not two hours hard ride
from this here now spot.

And that, by God, is the Lord's truth!

-Major Sorrel.
-Yes, sir.

Will you go to General Lee's headquarters
and notify him about this?

Yes, sir.

-Captain Goree.
-Yes, sir.

Get this man a tent.

And a cigar.

Sir.

He says the lead element is here
with the Third Corps...

the Sixth right behind...

supported by a column of federal cavalry.

Seven corps all together.

The First and Eleventh
are above Taneytown.

And there's more cavalry two hours east.

There may be as many
as 100,000 altogether.

Do you believe the man, this Mr. Harrison?

No choice. You remember him, sir,
the actor from Mississippi?

An actor?
We move on the word of an actor?

Can't afford not to.

There would be some word
from General Stuart.

General Stuart would not leave us blind.

One other thing. Hooker's been replaced.

George Meade's the new commander.
Harrison read it in the Yankee papers.

George Meade, Pennsylvania man.

Meade would be cautious, I think.

Take him some time to get organized.

Perhaps we should move more swiftly.

There may be an opportunity here.

Yes, sir.

No reason to delay.

I think we should concentrate here.

All the roads converge
just east of this gap.

-This junction will be very necessary.
-Yes, sir.

I left my spectacles over there.
What is the name of this town?

Gettysburg.

Very well.

Message for Colonel Chamberlain.

Colonel, darling. Rise up, me bucko.

I'm sorry, darling,
but we got a bit of a problem here.

Would you like to hear about it?

Would you wake up, sir?

We got a whole company coming, sir.

This way. I'll give you time to wake up,
but we've got quite a problem.

Altogether, 120 men are coming.
We're to be having them as guests.

What?

Should be here any minute.

-Who?
-Mutineers.

Mutineers, Colonel, me lad.

120 men from the old Second Maine
which has been disbanded.

120 mutineers?

Yes, sir.

You see, what happened was
the enlistment papers...

on the old Second Maine run out.

They were sent home,
all except these 120 fellows...

who foolishly signed three-year papers.

Three years, that is.

So these poor fellows
got one more year to serve.

Only they thought they were signing
to fight only with the Second Maine...

and the Second Maine only.

So they...

quit.

They resigned, you see. 120 men.

-Colonel, are you all right?
-Yeah.

The point is,
these Maine fellows won't fight no more.

Nobody can send them home
and nobody knows what to do with them.

Until they thought of us...

being as we are the only other
Maine regiment in the Fifth Corps.

So they've been assigned to us.

Yes, sir.

I have a message here
from the new commanding general.

George Meade, sir.

That's right.

Our very own general
of our very own corps...

has been promoted
to command of the whole army.

The latest, if you keep track of them
as they go by.

The message says they'll be arriving
this morning and they are to join us.

"And if they refuse to follow orders,
please feel free to shoot them."

-To shoot them?
-Yes, sir.

These Maine men?

"You are hereby authorized to shoot
any man who refuses to do his duty."

Are these all Maine men?

Yes, sir. And fine big fellows they are, too.

Mutiny. I thought that was
a word for the Navy.

We'll move at sunrise.

It's a good time of the day.

I always do enjoy this time,
just before the dawn.

When all this is over,
I shall miss it very much.

Sir?

I didn't mean the fighting.

It's all in God's hands now.

Good day, sir.

Good day to you.

General, sir.

Should I wake them up, sir? Should I
get them waked up and get going?

No, Moxley.

Let the boys sleep a little longer.
They'll need it.

Yes, sir.

Prisoners, mark file, left!

How many men do we have now
in the 20th Maine?

Somewhere around 250, sir,
counting the officers.

How the heck are we supposed
to take care of 120 men?

Colonel, it's going to be a hot day today.

Seeing as you already been down
with the heat, will you ride the horse...

that the good Lord provided,
instead of marching in the dirty dust?

You walked.

Darling, I've been in the infantry
since you was in books.

After the first few thousand miles,
a man gets limber with his feet.

Morning, Lawrence.

How are you?
You're looking kind of peaked.

Darn it, Tom. Don't call me Lawrence.

It doesn't make sense.

Hold a gun on a man to get him to fight.

Detail, about face.

Attention, detail!

You heard the Captain. Stand at attention!

Guards, get these men back on their feet!

I'm looking for commanding officer,
20th Maine.

You found him.

-That's him, all right.
-You're Chamberlain?

Colonel Chamberlain to you.

Captain Brewer, sir.

118th Pennsylvania.

If you're the commanding officer,
I present you with these prisoners.

You're welcome to them.

Lord knows, I had to use the bayonet
to keep them moving.

You have to sign for them.

Sign it, Lieutenant.

You are relieved, Captain.

You are authorized to use
whatever force necessary.

You want to shoot them...

go right ahead.

Won't nobody say nothing.

I said you are relieved, Captain.

You men can leave now.
We won't be needing any guards.

My name is Chamberlain.
I'm the Colonel of the 20th Maine.

When did you have something to eat?

They're trying to break us
by not feeding us.

We ain't broke yet.

They just told me you were coming
a little while ago.

I'll get the cook going.

The meat may be raw,
but there's no time to cook.

We've got quite a ways to go today.
You'll be coming with us, so eat hearty.

We'll set you up in those trees.
Sergeant Tozier, see to it.

Yes, sir.

You boys go eat, then I'll come over
and hear what you have to say.

Colonel, we've got grievances.

The men elected me to talk for them.

All right. You come along with me.

The rest of you boys go eat.
We're going to get moving in a little bit.

All right, men, on your feet.

-Gosh, Lawrence.
-Smile. Don't call me Lawrence.

-Are they moving?
-Yes, sir.

Forward, march.

What's your name?

I don't feel too kindly, Colonel.

Yes, well, I'm usually not this informal.

I just took command
of this regiment a few days ago.

Somebody ought to welcome you
to my...our outfit.

They tell me they're holding you fellows
because you signed three-year papers.

I'm sorry. Would you like some coffee?

Are you sure?

-Go ahead. Sit down, Mister....
-Bucklin.

Joseph Bucklin.

Listen, Colonel.
I've been in 11 different engagements.

How many have you been in?

Not that many.

It ain't the papers.

I've done my share. We all have.

They are damn good men.
Shouldn't be used this way.

Look here.

It went clean through.

We got a courier coming.

Listen, Colonel. I'm tired.

You know what I mean? I'm tired.

I've had all this army, all these officers....
This damn Hooker, this damn idiot Meade.

All of them. The whole bloody, lousy mess
of sick-brained, potbellied scareheads.

They ain't fit to lead a johnny detail.

They ain't fit to pour pee out of a boot
with instructions written under the heel.

I'm tired.

We're good men
and we had our own good flag.

These damn idiots used us
like we were cows or dogs or worse.

We aren't gonna win this war.

We can't win with these
lame-brained bastards from West Point.

These damn gentlemen! These officers!

The courier, sir.

Don't go away.

Colonel Chamberlain, sir.

Colonel Vincent wishes to inform you
the Fifth Corps is moving out.

You and the 20th Maine Regiment
are instructed to lead.

20th Maine's assigned first position in line.
Send out advanced guards and flankers.

-Flankers?
-Yes, flankers.

Right, yes.
My compliments to the Colonel.

Captain Clark, you heard him.
Get the regiment up.

Sound the assembly. Strike the tents.

You better get something to eat.
Looks like you could use it.

Tell your men I'm coming.

The boys from the Second Maine
are being fed, Lawrence.

Don't call me Lawrence.

Damn it, Lawrence. I'm your brother.

Be careful about the name business
in front of the men.

Because we're brothers,
it looks like favoritism.

General Meade got his own son
as his aide-de-camp.

That's different. Generals can do anything.

Nothing quite so much like God on earth
as a general on battlefield.

What are you going to do with them?
Colonel, sir.

You can't shoot them.
You never go back to Maine if you do.

I know that.

I wonder if they do.

Colonel, sir. You know who this man is?

Dan Burns, from Orono.
I know his daddy, the preacher.

Best cusser I ever heard.

Knows more fine swear words
than any man in Maine.

You men gather around.

I've been talking with Private Bucklin.
He's told me about your problem.

There's nothing I can do today.

We're moving out in a few minutes.
We'll be moving all day.

I've been ordered
to take you men with me.

I'm told that...

if you don't come, I can shoot you.

Well, you know I won't do that.

Maybe somebody else will, but I won't.

So, that's that.

Here's the situation.

The whole reb army is up that road
a ways waiting for us.

This is no time for an argument.

I tell you, we could surely use you fellows.

We're now well below half strength.

Whether you fight or not, that's up to you.

Whether you come along is....
Well, you're coming.

You know who we are, why we're here.

If you fight alongside us,
there's a few things you must know.

This regiment was formed
last summer in Maine.

There were 1,000 of us then.

There are less than 300 of us now.

All of us volunteered to fight
for the Union, just as you did.

Some came mainly because
we were bored at home.

Thought this looked like it might be fun.

Some came because
we were ashamed not to.

Many of us came
because it was the right thing to do.

And all of us have seen men die.

This is a different kind of army.

If you look back through history,
you'll see men fighting for pay...

for women, for some other kind of loot.

They fight for land, power.

Because a king leads them,
or just because they like killing.

We are here for something new.

This has not happened much
in the history of the world.

We are an army out to set other men free.

America should be free ground.

All of it.

Not divided by a line
between slave state and free.

All the way from here to the Pacific Ocean.

No man has to bow.

No man born to royalty.

Here we judge you by what you do,
not by who your father was.

Here you can be something.

Here is the place to build a home.

But it's not the land.

There's always more land.

It's the idea that we all have value.

You and me.

What we're fighting for, in the end...

we're fighting for each other.

Sorry.

I didn't mean to preach.

You go ahead.

You talk for a while.

If you choose to join us and want
your muskets back, you can have them.

Nothing more will be said
by anybody, anywhere.

If you choose not to join us,
you can come along under guard.

When this is over, I'll do what I can...

to see you get a fair treatment,
but for now, we're moving out.

Gentlemen.

I think if we lose this fight...

we lose the war.

So, if you choose to join us,
I'll be personally very grateful.

Colonel, it's a fine morning.

-Captain Spear, are we ready?
-Sir, that we are.

Then let's move out.

20th Maine!

Forward!

March!

That's infantry, all right.

At least a whole brigade.

Any sign of cavalry?

Not a lick, sir.

That's strange.

Infantry moving alone
in enemy country, blind.

Very strange, sir.

What do you make of that?

He's headed this way.

Sir?

Lee's turned. That's the main body.

You think so?

-I thought they were going to Harrisburg.
-He was.

That's too many troops
to be a raiding party.

There's power behind it.

Sir, if you want to fight here,
this is such lovely ground.

It's the best damn ground I've seen all day.

It is that.

We'll move both brigades into town.

That'll make the good citizens happy.

Let's go down and have a look.

-Soldier, your shirt needs mending.
-I thought the war was in Virginia.

What division are you boys with?

Colonel, do you mind?

A good officer doesn't ride all day.
I've been sitting too long anyway.

What do you think?

-What do you think?
-About what?

About the Second Maine boys, what else?

Are any of them going to join us?

Would you believe it? All but six!

What?

I counted by actual vote.
114 voted to pick up the rifle.

-Well, I'll be.
-You did good, brother, real good!

Good. See to it they march together.

Yes. Glazier's got the hardheads in tow.
There are six.

Get the names.
Put them in different companies.

I want them spread out,
not bunched together.

-I'll see about their muskets.
-Colonel, sir.

You know what's happening here
in the morning?

Sir?

The whole damn rebel army
is gonna be here.

They'll move through this town,
occupy the hills on the other side.

When our people arrive, Lee'll have
high ground. There'll be the devil to pay.

The high ground!

Meade will come in slowly, cautiously,
new to command.

They'll be on his back from Washington.

Wires hot with messages. Attack! Attack!

So he will set up a ring around these hills.

And when Lee's army is nicely entrenched
behind fat rocks on the high ground...

Meade will finally attack,
if he can coordinate the army.

Straight up the hillside, out in the open...

in that gorgeous field of fire.

We will charge valiantly
and be butchered valiantly.

And afterward, men in tall hats and
gold watch fobs will thump their chest...

and say what a brave charge it was.

Devin, I've led a soldier's life...

and I've never seen anything
as brutally clear as this.

It's as if I can actually see the blue troops
in one long bloody moment...

going up the long slope to the stony top...

as if it were already done...

and already a memory.

An odd, set...

stony quality to it.

As if tomorrow has already happened
and there's nothing you can do about it.

The way you sometimes feel
before an ill-considered attack...

knowing it will fail...

but you cannot stop it.

You must even take part and help it fail.

We have 2,500 men.

They'll be coming in force.

There could be 20,000
coming down that road in the morning.

If we hold this ridge for a couple of hours,
we can keep them away.

We can block that road
until our main body gets here.

We can deprive the enemy
of the high ground!

The boys are ready for a brawl.
No doubt of that.

We'll force the reb to deploy.

That's a narrow road
they'll be coming down.

If we stack them up, it will take them a
while to get on track to get into position.

Is Calef's battery up yet?

His six guns are deploying now.

How far back is Reynolds
with the main force?

About 10 miles, sir. Not much more.

Sir, you were right.

My scouts report the rebel army
is coming this way for sure.

They're all concentrating in this direction.

We'll hold here in the morning.

Long enough for Reynolds
and the infantry to arrive.

If we hang on to the high ground,
we have a chance...

to win this fight that's coming.

-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

Post the cannon along this road,
the Chambersburg Pike.

The rebels will hit us at dawn.
I think we can hold them at least 2 hours.

Hell, General,
we can hold them all the livelong day.

He's right, sir.

At Thoroughfare Gap,
you held against Longstreet.

-You held for six hours.
-They never came. We held for nothing.

The rebs will hit us just about first light.

Keep a clear eye.

Have the pickets give us a good warning.

All right, gentlemen.

Let's get posted.

<i>General Reynolds,</i>
<i>my troops are deployed on good ground...</i>

<i>west of Gettysburg</i>
<i>on the Chambersburg Pike.</i>

<i>I've sent reconnaissance parties</i>
<i>in every direction...</i>

<i>from which the enemy</i>
<i>might be approaching.</i>

<i>I'm satisfied A.P. Hill's corps</i>
<i>is massed just west of here...</i>

<i>back of Cashtown.</i>

<i>The enemy's pickets</i>
<i>are within four miles of my position.</i>

<i>Rumor says Ewell's coming</i>
<i>over the mountains from Carlisle.</i>

<i>If true, two Confederate corps</i>
<i>will converge upon us in the morning.</i>

<i>One from the west and one from the north.</i>

<i>Do you want me to hold</i>
<i>this position if attacked?</i>

<i>Confirmation requested.</i>

<i>J.N.O. Buford.</i>

<i>"Bow down thy heaven, O Lord.</i>

<i>"Come down and touch the mountains</i>
<i>and they shall smoke.</i>

<i>"Blessed be the Lord, my strength,</i>
<i>which teaches my fingers to fight...</i>

<i>"and my hands to war. Amen. "</i>

Good morning, Lucy.

Traveler, good morning to you, sir.

Good morning, sir.

Good morning, Major Taylor.

-Will the General have some breakfast?
-No, thank you.

We have flapjacks in small mountains.

Fresh butter, bacon, wagons of ham,
apple butter, ripe cherries.

You really ought to pitch in, sir.

Courtesy of our host,
the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Good morning, sir.

General Longstreet, good morning.

Federal forces are concentrating.

Yes, and I've confirmed
some of your man Harrison's information.

Their new commander
is definitely George Meade.

I have reports of Union cavalry
in Gettysburg.

Cavalry?

General Hill reports only militia.

He did?

Well, it's cavalry.

Where there's cavalry,
infantry will be close behind.

Meade's closing fast.

It could be he's thinking
of swinging round behind us.

Behind, in front: direction does not matter.
We'll fight him wherever he is.

Probably got old Abe Lincoln on his back
frantic to throw us out of Pennsylvania.

We may have an opportunity here.

I agree.

Our objective was to get their army
out of Virginia and into the open.

Now they are in the open.

General Meade has been forcing
the march.

The weather has been unusually hot.

He will probably arrive here worn out
and weary, piece by piece.

If we concentrate,
we can hit him as he comes up.

If we can take out a few of his corps,
we can even the odds.

But we must strike hard
and we must strike quickly.

What artillery is that, Major?

I don't know, sir.

General Heth is in front.

-My instructions were clear?
-Yes, sir. To all commanders.

Avoid contact with the enemy
until the army's up and concentrated.

And General Heth?

He has instructions
not to force major action.

I told him this morning.

We should move closer to the front.
Send for General Heth.

-I must know what is going on.
-Yes, sir.

General...

in the fight that is coming,
I want you to stay back from the main line.

This army has lost too many
of its veteran commanders...

and you, sir, have a very bad habit
of moving too far forward.

Can't lead from behind.

May I say it plainly, sir.

I cannot afford to lose you.

Now, General, let's look to this day.
You may bring up your corps.

Major Taylor, have Traveler saddled up.

-I'm going to look around for myself.
-Yes, sir.

They've got a brigade in position
and that's all.

We've got the best damn ground around,
and they're hitting me with one brigade.

Lovely.

Go on down, gentlemen.

Fall back!

They are on the run.

Close crop, General.

-How are your losses?
-Not bad at all, sir.

We got them out in the open.
Really got a twist on them.

They are arrogant people, you know?
They came right at us.

We took some prisoners.
They're from Heth's division of Hill's corps.

That's what I've got in front of me.

A new division. 8,000 men more or less.
All within sound of this.

Just back up that road between here
and Cashtown. A little ways up the road.

It'll take them a little while to get on line.

Yes, sir, but Hill's whole corps is behind.
Maybe 25,000.

Longstreet behind that.
Ewell over there to the north.

I know, Colonel.

When John Reynolds gets here,
he won't have the full army with him.

Only part of it.

The point is, the rebs will be here
this afternoon...

with everything they've got.
I just thought I'd mention it.

What do you want me to do here, sir?

Heth will be back in a bit.

If he's got any brains at all,
and he's not stupid...

he'll know by now he's got at least
a brigade in front of him.

He won't wait
to get his whole division in line.

That would take half the morning.

He don't need his whole division.

That's right.

Does Devin report any activity on his front
over to the right?

-No, sir. Not a lick.
-All right.

I'll have Devin leave his cover
and withdraw his boys...

and have them move in alongside you,
lengthening your line.

When Heth gets back,
he'll run into two brigades.

That ought to hold him
until Reynolds gets here.

Right, sir.

Damn sure glad the rain is gone.
Don't want anything to slow up Reynolds.

Take care of yourself, Colonel.

Don't worry about me, sir.
I'm the soul of caution.

Fire!

Move! Fall back!

That flank.... Hold it!

Keep up your fire!

Gamble's down, sir.

Colonel Gamble, but he's not hurt bad, sir.

I'm all right.

It was close, that's all.

Sir, Colonel Devin's compliments.
No problem on the right.

They came up close,
but we put in the reserve.

We didn't put it all in, sir.

Wishes to know if you have further orders.

Tell Devin all reserve forward, now.

Keep up your fire!

Fire!

Fire!

Sir, it's General Reynolds.

Thank God.

What goes, John?

There's the devil to pay!

-Can you hold?
-I reckon I can.

Heth probably has about 10,000 men
coming down that road, wouldn't you say?

Yes, sir. But there'll be more behind him.

We can put almost 20,000 in the field.
We're in very good shape, I think.

For a while, sir.

I'm sending messages to all commanders
to come here with all possible speed.

It's lovely ground.

I thought so, sir.

Now let's go surprise Harry Heth.

Come on.

-General Heth.
-Sir. I beg to report.

Yes.

Very strange, sir.
The situation is very confused.

What happened?

I moved in this morning, as directed.

I thought it was only a few militia,
but it was dismounted cavalry, sir.

There weren't all that many,
and the boys wouldn't hold back.

I thought we shouldn't be stopped
by a few dismounted cavalry...

but they made a good fight.

They really put up a scrap, sir.

Go on, General.

Well, sir, they wouldn't leave.

My boys got their dander up.

We deployed the whole division
and went after them.

We just about had them running
then all of a sudden...

they got infantry support.

We got pushed back.

Then we re-formed and tried again.
We couldn't just leave it to them, sir.

Now there's more Yankee infantry coming.
I don't know how many.

But I don't know
what else we could've done.

It started as a minor scrap
with a few militia.

The next thing I know,
I'm tangling with half the Union army.

Things will get out of control, Mr. Heth.
That is why we have orders.

-Is it possible you misunderstood them?
-No, sir.

Can you identify those people?

The infantry is the First Corps,
the Black Hats.

There's another corps coming
that we haven't identified.

I must have all possible information
on enemy strength.

Major Taylor, I want you to ride forward
to the highest position and observe.

-And do be careful.
-Yes, sir.

-Sir, shall I attack?
-No, sir.

We are not ready for full engagement.

General Longstreet is not up
with his corps.

Sir, the enemy is disorganized.

If we throw all our forces in the field,
we will have the advantage.

Is that our artillery?

Yes, sir.

I can't imagine what has happened
to General Stuart.

-I've heard nothing. Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

I have no idea of what lies in front of me.
It may be the entire federal army.

Sir, compliments of Colonel Babbit.

Rebels are coming from the north.
Your instructions, sir?

That'll be Ewell's corps.
They're trying to flank us.

We got to meet them
and force them to go on line.

Tell Colonel Devin to get up that way
as quick as he can.

We'll get Gamble's boys back in the saddle
and be there shortly.

General Rodes has encountered
Yankee cavalry, sir.

Buford's brigades.

General Early's right behind him
and will be on the field within the hour.

General Early may be attacked
by half the federal army within the hour.

-Is that Pender's artillery?
-Yes, sir. He's up now, sir.

Four batteries in position
with two more in reserve.

With General Rodes attacking up there
and Pender and I, we have three divisions.

We could sweep them.

General, sir.

I saw only two federal corps.
First and Eleventh.

And, General, I saw Early's lead columns
coming down north of Rodes' lines.

He'll be engaged any minute, sir.

Sir, we got 20,000 infantry coming down
almost behind the Union lines.

It's perfect, sir.

God's will.

Gentlemen, it would appear
the fight is already underway.

General Heth, you may attack, sir.

My orders to all commanders: attack.

Fire!

Forward men, final brigade forward!

Forward! For God's sake, forward!

He's dead.

One thing about this brigade
is we got our own special bugle call.

Ever hear tell of Dan Butterfield?

What, General Butterfield?
What was with Hooker?

That's the same fellow.

-He used to be our brigade commander.
-Yeah, he was a pistol.

-No man like him for having a good time.
-I don't know about that.

But I know he used to like
to write bugle calls.

The problem with this army is,
we got too many calls.

We got a call for artillery, infantry,
get up and eat, retreat.

Anyway, old Butterfield, he wrote
a special call for this here brigade.

Say there is an order for this brigade,
you and me.

He'll be blowing his bugle, we will think
that order's for us when it wasn't.

We'll follow that order anyway,
then we'll be in a world of hurt.

Yeah, that happened to me once.
Us, that is.

Half the regiment charged,
the other half retreated.

You had your choice.

This here brigade got a special call.

You hear that call,
you know the next one is for you.

It goes like this.

Colonel, sir.

Begging the Colonel's pardon.

But would the Colonel please do us a favor
and get back on the damned horse?

I'll tell you, sir,
it's not easy handling these new recruits...

when the officers act
like they ain't got any sense, sir.

Lawrence, sir.

We've gone over 20 miles today.

We've gone over 100 miles
in five days, sir.

There's something going on.

-Colonel Vincent, sir.
-Mister Chamberlain.

Far cry from Bowdoin College,
wouldn't you say?

No farther than Harvard Yard.

Indeed. With luck, we'll both see
our alma maters again.

In the meantime, Colonel, you move
your boys along as best you can.

Two corps have engaged at Gettysburg.

So we'll keep going through dark
and on until we get there.

Yes, sir.

Godspeed.

Fire!

They're running!

General Pender begs to report
that the enemy is falling back.

-They're on the run.
-Very well, Lieutenant.

General Early says the enemy has caved in
on the left flank, going back to Gettysburg.

-They're all running.
-Very well. Thank you, Corporal.

Find General Hill's chief of artillery.

Tell him I want fire placed on that hill.
As much fire as possible.

-Yes, sir.
-Very well.

-Major Taylor.
-Yes, sir.

Deliver this message in person.

Tell General Ewell the federal troops
are withdrawing in confusion.

We must only push those people
in order to gain the heights.

Tell him to take that hill, if practical.
The one beyond the town.

Do you understand?

-Yes, sir.
-Very well.

Congratulations, General.

I want you to see this.

It's like second Manassas all over again.

Couldn't have worked better
if we'd planned it.

If we can take that hill,
I want it occupied by nightfall.

Sir, the federal army has fallen back
through Gettysburg.

They're reforming on the ridges
outside of town.

Very well.

This is almost perfect.
We got them where we want them.

Let's move south and east,
get between them and Lincoln...

find some high ground...

and they'll have to hit us.

Then we have them, General.

You mean disengage?

I've always been under the impression...

that it was our strategy to conduct
a defensive campaign wherever possible...

in order to keep the army intact.

Granted, but the situation has changed.

-In what way?
-We've already pushed them back.

They're on the run, vacating the town.

How can we move off
in the face of the enemy?

-Major Marshall?
-Yes, sir.

I ordered firing on that hill,
but no cannons are firing.

-Send over and find out why.
-I'll see to it, sir.

Thank you.

What are you thinking, General?

Maybe we should not have fought here.

I know that. But we have prevailed.
The men have prevailed.

Yes. They've always done that.

But in the morning,
we may be outnumbered...

and they'll be entrenched
on the high ground.

You know as well as I, we've never been
concerned with being outnumbered.

That is true, sir. You are right.

If we move south to Washington,
they have to pursue us.

Then we can fight on ground
of our choosing.

But the enemy is here.

We did not want the fight,
but the fight is here.

How can I ask this army to retreat
in the face of what they've done this day?

Not retreat, sir. Re-deploy.

Our guns will move them off that hill
or Ewell will push them off.

But if Meade is there tomorrow,
I can't move this army away.

I will attack him.

If Meade is up there tomorrow,
it is because he wants us to attack him.

We pushed back two corps,
but there are five more coming.

General, I will bring up my boys
as soon as I can.

Very well.

-General?
-Sir?

Your man Harrison, the actor,
he was quite correct.

Had it not been for him, this entire army
might have been destroyed in detail.

The federal force might've been here
waiting when we turned around.

I'm deeply grateful to you, sir.

Hello, men.

What outfit are you with?

Archer's brigade, Heth's division.

-Where are you from?
-Tennessee.

How about you?

Maine.

I've never been to Tennessee.

I reckon I've never been to Maine neither.

I don't mean no disrespect
to you fighting men...

but sometimes I can't help but figure,
why are you fighting this war?

Why are you fighting it?

To free the slaves, of course.
And to preserve the Union.

I don't know about other folk,
but I ain't fighting for no darkies.

I'm fighting for my rights.

That's what we're all fighting for.

For your what?

For our rights.

Why is it you folks can't just live
the way you want to live...

and let us live the way we do?

"Live and let live," I hear some folks say.

Be a mite less fuss and bother
if more folks took it to heart.

Where'd you get captured?

Railroad cut just west of Gettysburg town.

It wasn't a pretty sight.

Many a good boy lost
a young and promising life.

Some wore blue, some wore gray.

Seen enough of this war?

I guess I have.

I guess I have, too.

It looks like I'll be sitting out the rest of it.

I appreciate you talking to me.

See you in hell, Billy Yank.

See you in hell, Johnny Reb.

I have found a John Henry, sir.

John who?

A John Henry, sir. A runaway.
I heard him a-groaning.

Is he wounded?

Don't know for sure.

The man's exhausted.

We'll get him something to eat.
The surgeon's on the way.

-Did you get his name?
-He said something I couldn't understand.

I can't understand anyone
south of Mason-Dixon.

Rebs or darkies.

All right, men, as you were.
Surgeon, see to him.

We used to have visitors from the South
before the war.

They were always very polite, academic,
you understand.

We stayed off the question of slavery
out of courtesy.

But toward the end there was
no getting away from it...

and yet I could never understand.
I don't now.

I don't know why.

They fight so well.

Tell me something, Buster...

what do you think of Negroes?

Well, if you mean the race...

I don't really know.

This is not a thing to be ashamed of.

The thing is, you cannot judge a race.

Any man who judges by the group
is a pea-wit.

You take men one at a time.

To me, there was never any difference.

-None at all?
-None at all.

Of course, I haven't known
that many freed men...

but those I knew in Bangor, Portland...

you look in the eye, there was a man.

There was a "divine spark,"
as my mother used to call it.

That is all there is to it.

Races are men.

"What a piece of work is man.

"How infinite in faculties,
in form and moving...

"how express and admirable.

"In action, how like an angel."

Well, if he's an angel, all right then...

but he damn well must be a killer angel.

Colonel, darling, you're a lovely man.

I see a great vast difference between us,
yet I admire you, lad.

You're an idealist, praise be.

The truth is, Colonel...

there is no "divine spark."

There's many a man alive no more of value
than a dead dog. Believe me.

When you've seen them hang each other
the way I have back in the Old Country.

Equality?

What I'm fighting for is the right to prove
I'm a better man than many of them.

Where have you seen this "divine spark"
in operation, Colonel?

Where have you noted
this magnificent equality?

No two things on earth are equal
or have an equal chance.

Not a leaf, not a tree.

There's many a man worse than me
and some better...

but I don't think race or country
matters a damn.

What matters, Colonel...

is justice.

Which is why I'm here.

I'll be treated as I deserve...

not as my father deserved.

I'm Kilrain...

and I damn all gentlemen.

There is only one aristocracy...

and that is right here.

And that's why we've got to win this war.

Howdy.

Howdy, General.

Hello, my boys. Virginia has arrived!

General Pickett presents
his compliments...

and asks to <i>parler</i> with
the commanding general, <i>s'il vous plaît</i>.

Hey, George.

General.

Good Lord, what is that smell?

That's me. Ain't it lovely?

He got it off a dead Frenchman.

-Good evening to you, James.
-Hey, Lo.

I did not get it off a dead Frenchman.

I bought it in a store
in Richmond with Sally.

It did have a French name,
but Miss Corbert likes it.

Excuse me.

Gentlemen? Colonel Fremantle?

Allow me to introduce
Major General George Pickett.

General Pickett,
Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Fremantle...

of Her Majesty's venerable
and elite Cold Stream Guards...

Britain's military attach<i>é</i>
to the Confederacy...

and, you might say,
the eyes and ears of Queen Victoria.

Hardly, sir. I'm merely an observer
and your humble guest.

The fame of your regiment
has preceded you.

General Pickett here
is our ranking strategist.

The First Corps Army of Northern Virginia.
We refer all our deeper questions to him.

They do. They do indeed.

His record at West Point
is still the talk of both armies.

You know I consider it unbecoming
to a soldier, all this book learning.

-Book learning ain't for gentlemen, right?
-Nor that either.

He graduated last in his class. Dead last.

Quite a feat, considering his classmates.

The Yankees got all the smart ones.
Look where it's got them.

Let me present my commanders.

Each one of these chaps, as you might say,
commands a brigade of mine.

Now this fellow here, this is Lo Armistead.

Lo! That's short for Lothario.

The lover!

This here is Richard Brooke Garnett.
You'll pardon his limp.

He got kicked by his horse the other day.

That fellow there....

That's Jim Kemper.

You note the shifty eye,
the hand in the pocket.

He's not even a West Pointer,
so watch him.

He's a politician from Virginia.
Jimmy's only here for the votes.

I was Speaker of the House in Virginia.

As a matter of fact, I'd like to talk to you
about some political matters.

You know the Queen, don't you?

What I need to know
and tell my folks back home is:

When are you going to do something...

about that damn Yankee blockade
out there on the water?

Can you tell me something about that?

Have you heard any news of old Winfield?

Old Winnie boy?

Hancock? Oh, yeah.

Well, how's he doing?

You're going to find out.

He's got the Second Corps.

He's headed this way. Probably run
into him in the next few days.

I wish I could see him again.

I haven't seen him since before the war.

Never thought it would last this long.

Me neither, Lo.

I sure would like to talk
to old Hancock again.

One more time.

Well, why not?

You wouldn't mind?

Hell, no.

I mean, really.

Do you think it would be proper?
You know, ethical?

When the time comes, and he's close...

just send a messenger over
under a flag of truce and go on over.

Ain't nothing to it.

Last time I saw him was in California.

Right when the war was beginning...

the night before we all left
to go fight against each other.

Old friends off to war.

How's your brigade?

I've never seen troops anywhere
so ready for a brawl.

I've got to give the old man credit.
A lot of credit for that.

Who else could've held
this army together for so long?

Remember what they used to say
about him?

When he first took command?
They called him "Old Granny."

Lord, what damn fools we were.

Now when he passes...

the boys hush as if they had seen
an angel of the Lord.

Have you ever seen anything like that?

No. I can't say I have.

It's amazing what one honest man can do.

One honest man and a cause.

I don't think on that too much anymore.

I guess my only cause is victory.

This war comes as a nightmare.
You pick your nightmare side.

Then you put your head down and win.

Old gloomy Pete!

You see, Colonel....

The government derives its power
from the consent of the people.

Every government, everywhere.

Let me make this very plain to you, sir.

We do not consent
and we will never consent.

And what you've got to do is,
you've got to go back over there...

to your Parliament and you've got
to make it very plain to them.

You've got to tell them
that what we're fighting for here...

is the freedom from what we consider
to be the rule of a foreign power.

I mean, that's all we want.
That's what this war is all about.

Now we established this country
in the first place...

with very strong state governments...

just for that very reason.

I mean, let me put it to you this way.

My home is in Virginia.

The government of my home is home.

Virginia would not allow itself
to be ruled...

by some king over there in London.

It's not about to let itself be ruled
by some president in Washington.

Virginia, by God, sir,
is going to be run by Virginians.

Oh, my. The Cause.

Actually, Jimmy, I got a pair of kings.

And it's all for the Yankees.

The damn money-grubbing Yankees.

I mean, those damn fools,
they don't get the message.

Always the darkies.
Nothing but the darkies.

You know, Jim....

Sit down. I think that my idea...

my analogy of a gentlemen's club
is fair enough. It's clear enough.

Colonel, think on it now.

Suppose that we all joined a club,
a gentlemen's club.

After a time, several of the members
began to intrude themselves...

into our private lives, our home lives.

Began telling us
what we could and couldn't do.

Well, then, wouldn't any one of us
have the right to resign?

I mean, just resign.

That's what we did.

That's what I did and now these people
are telling us we don't have that right.

I got to hand it to you.

You certainly do have a talent
for trivializing the momentous...

and complicating the obvious.

Have you ever considered
running for Congress?

No. It's a thought.

What does Colonel Fremantle think?

Will the British come in on our side?

Hell, yeah. They'll come in
when we don't need them no more.

Like some damn bank lending you money
when you're no longer in debt.

-Look here, Mr. Speaker....
-George.

A word?

Goodnight, Colonel.

See you later.

In the next few days, I believe
we're going to have a hell of a fight here.

I want you to do everything necessary
to get your boys ready.

You can start bringing them up
by the first light.

I want you all in Gettysburg
by tomorrow night.

Yes, sir.

Good evening, John.

I'm surprised you could find headquarters
with all that confusion.

There's an old Indian saying:

"Follow the cigar smoke
and find a fat man there."

General Hancock.

How are you, John?

I'm all right.

But the brigades are pretty shot up.
I need to get refitted.

Right. I'll see to it.
We know what you did this morning.

-That was one hell of a piece of soldiering.
-Thank you, sir.

Heard you were with John Reynolds
when he was killed.

I'm sending the body up
to his folks in Lancaster.

They might appreciate a note from you.

I'll send it.

He was a soldier.

And a good friend.

Three of us, Reynolds,
Lo Armistead and I came up together.

Mexican War.

California.

We stayed close.

I wonder how old Lo is doing.
If he's still alive.

Heard he had one of Pickett's brigades.

Under Longstreet.

Remarkable.

Just across the ridge.

I'd like to see him again, but not here.
Not like this.

Well, maybe after the war.

Where do you want me in the morning?

I want you to hold your position
on the extreme left.

Get some rest if you can.

We may need you in the morning.

Jeb Stuart's still on the prowl
out there someplace.

Yes, sir.

Well, General Reynolds...

we held the high ground.

General Trimble is waiting.

-Will you see him now?
-Very well.

Major, I want a scouting party sent out
posthaste to find General Stuart.

-Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
-Thank you.

General Trimble.

Sir, I most respectfully request
another assignment.

Do please go on, General.

The man is a disgrace.

Sir, have you been listening at all
to what the aides have been telling you?

Ask General Gordon or General Ewell.
Ask them.

We could've taken that hill.

God in his wisdom knows
we should've taken it.

There was no one there at all
and it commanded the town.

General Gordon saw it.
I mean, he was with us.

Me and Ewell and Gordon...

all standing in the dark like idiots
with that bloody damned hill empty.

I beg your pardon, General.

That bloody damned hill was bare
as his bloody damned head!

We all saw it, as God is my witness.

We were all there.

I said to him, "General Ewell,
we have got to take that hill."

General Jackson wouldn't have stopped
with them on the run...

and plenty of light
on a hill like that empty.

God help us!

I don't know....

I don't know why....

Do please continue, General.

Yes, sir.

Sir.

I said to General Ewell these words....

I said to him:

"Sir, give me one division
and I will take that hill."

He said nothing.
He just stood there and stared at me.

I said, "General Ewell,
give me one brigade...

"and I will take that hill."

I was becoming disturbed, sir.

And General Ewell put his arms
behind him and blinked.

So I said,
"General, give me one regiment...

"and I will take that hill."

And he said nothing.

He just stood there.

I threw down my sword.
Down on the ground in front of him.

We could have done it, sir.

A blind man should have seen it.

Now they're working up there.

You can hear the axes
of the federal troops.

And so in the morning...

many a good boy will die...

taking that hill.

Sir.

I must request another assignment.

No, sir. That won't be necessary.

You will be of great service.

And I do thank you.

General Meade, sir.

Hancock. It's so damn dark out there
I can't see a thing.

Gentlemen.

I hope to God that this is...

good ground.

Is this good ground, General?

Is this a place to have an army?

Very good ground, sir.

I hope you are right.

Because we are going to have a fight here
sure enough in the morning.

-Will there be anything else, sir?
-No, thank you, Major.

Very well.

<i>In the morning is the great battle.</i>

<i>Tomorrow or the next day</i>
<i>will determine the war.</i>

<i>Virginia is here.</i>

<i>All the South is here.</i>

<i>What will you do tomorrow?</i>

<i>In the morning...</i>

<i>the enemy will be up</i>
<i>in fortified positions on high ground.</i>

<i>Longstreet's corps will be coming up...</i>

<i>and my boys will be ready</i>
<i>to finish the job.</i>

<i>If I tell them to withdraw now? No, sir.</i>

<i>They've been patient for far too long.</i>

<i>With the enemy out there up on the hill...</i>

<i>they'll be ready to finish the job.</i>

<i>But I don't even know</i>
<i>how much is up there.</i>

<i>How many men? How many cannon?</i>

<i>I don't know the ground on the flanks.</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>If I wait in the morning,</i>
<i>the early morning...</i>

<i>maybe Meade, under pressure, will attack.</i>

<i>That would make General Longstreet</i>
<i>very happy.</i>

<i>But I don't think Meade will come down.</i>

<i>And I don't think I can withdraw, so...</i>

<i>God's will, thy will be done.</i>

Major Sorrel, you've met before.

Thank you, General.

The federal position was scouted
during the last several hours.

We've drawn it up here.

Now this is the situation.

The position of the federal army
is in the shape of a fishhook.

It starts here. You see these two hills?

This one and the one with the cemetery.

That is where they have concentrated
their troops.

The hook starts there.

Now it curves around and comes down
this low ridge to the south.

Ending before two round hills
of high elevation.

The federals have no troops
on those two hills.

-Carry on, Major.
-Thank you.

We now know that General Hancock
is in charge of the Union center.

There are now perhaps 60,000
to 70,000 men already in position.

Perhaps as high as 90,000.

I spoke with General Ewell
of your suggestion...

that we move around to the right
to flank the federal army.

And he is of the opinion that
withdrawing from Gettysburg...

and giving it back to the enemy
would be very bad for morale.

It is unnecessary.
It might even be dangerous.

Do you disagree?

We must attack.

I would prefer not to fight
upon this ground...

but every moment we delay
the enemy uses to reinforce himself.

We cannot support ourselves for long
in this country.

We must not allow the federal army
to move around behind...

and cut us off from home. No, sir.

We must strike him now.

We pushed him yesterday
and he will remember it.

The men are ready and they are eager.
I see no useful alternative.

Yes, sir.

Very well.

Gentlemen.

-Good morning, all.
-Good morning, sir.

Longstreet will attack on the right
with the First Corps.

Hill will support...

with Heth in reserve.

Ewell's people on the left
will demonstrate to keep the enemy...

from reinforcing against our right flank.

Yes, sir. But I still don't have Pickett.

He's at the rear of column,
a full day's march.

All I've got is Hood and McLaws.

I do believe that Hood's
and McLaws' divisions will be sufficient.

-With the General's permission.
-General Hood?

Moving in front of those rocky heights,
we'll have enfilade fire...

coming down on us.

Perhaps, but not for long. Your division...

will be up over this unoccupied hill,
the little, rocky one.

From there you will threaten
the enemy flank.

When you're heavily engaged,
General Ewell will strike from the left.

Very well, sir.

-General?
-Let's move out, gentlemen.

General Barksdale,
is Mississippi ready for this day?

-Mississippi is ready.
-Very well.

Let's go to it, Sam.

If he's right, General Lee...

then the war is over by sundown.

We'll see.

I don't like going in without Pickett.

It's like going in with one boot off.

I'll wait as long as I can.

Do you have any idea of the force?

We counted five corps, including
the two involved in yesterday's action.

That don't mean how many might be...

hidden behind those hills there.

And, damn it, with Stuart gone
there ain't no way of knowing for sure.

Take good care of yourself today,
you hear?

You, too, Pete.

With your permission, sir.

I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

That's Major General John Bell Hood,
but we call him Sam.

One of my three division commanders.
Fellows from Texas and Alabama.

You've been to Texas, as I recall.

Yes. Actually that's where I came through.

Courtesy of the Yankee Navy
who denied me any other point of entry.

It's a marvelous place, Texas.

Full of red Indians and Mexicans...

cowboys, bandits and desperados.

Even hotter and more humid
than this place.

If that's possible.

That fellow Hood...

does his performance in battle
match his appearance?

He really does look the part.

He does his job.

Most interesting army, I must say.

Virginia gentlemen fighting
alongside Texas frontiersmen...

and bayou bushwhackers from Louisiana.

Drawn together from across a continent.

Having traveled a good piece of it myself,
I feel a part...

or almost a member of this enterprise.

You call yourselves Americans,
but you're really transplanted Englishmen.

Look at your names, Lee, Hood...

Longstreet, Jackson, Stuart.

My people were Dutch.

And the same for your adversaries.
Meade, Hooker, Hancock, and...

shall I say? Lincoln.

The same God. Same language.
Same culture and history.

The same songs, stories, legends, myths.

But different dreams.

Different dreams.

It's so very sad. Very sad.

You English had your own civil war once,
didn't you?

That was ages ago.
We wouldn't dream of it now.

Cavaliers and Roundheads.

"Off with his head! "

Heads lying everywhere.

One could hardly take a step
without tripping over a fallen crown.

We're much more civilized now.

I assure you.

We have so much in common,
your country and mine.

I earnestly hope
that we shall become allies.

Your government would never ally itself
with a Confederacy...

that had the institution of slavery.
You know that. So do I.

We should have freed the slaves,
then fired on Fort Sumter.

I guess we Southerners and you English
have at least one thing in common.

We'd rather lose the war
than admit to the mistake.

We whupped you British twice
as I recollect.

Your candor is admirable,
if somewhat eccentric.

A little eccentricity is good for a general.

We Southerners like our men religious
and a little bit mad.

I suspect that's why the women
fall in love with preachers.

<i>In nomine pater, et filii, et spiritus sancti.</i>

Amen.

General Longstreet.

Do you mind if I accompany you?

Not at all. I'm very glad
to have you with us, sir.

The heat reminds me of Mexico.

Yes, but there it was very dry.

That was a good outfit.

I remember storming the ramparts
of Chapultapec with old George Pickett.

Reynolds.... My old friend,
Ulysses Sam Grant.

-There was some good men in that army.
-Yes, indeed.

Some of those men are waiting for us now
up ahead on those ridges.

I don't know. I sometimes feel troubled.

Those fellows, those boys in blue,
they never quite seem the enemy.

I know.

I used to command some of those boys.
Swore an oath, too.

I couldn't fight against Georgia
and South Carolina.

Not against my own family.

No, sir. There was always a higher duty
to Virginia.

That was our first duty.

There was never any question about that.

-I guess so.
-Let us not think about that now.

The issue is in God's hands.

We can only do our duty.

General?

Soldiering has one great trap.

To be a good soldier
you must love the army.

To be a good commander,
you must be willing to order the death...

of the thing you love.

We do not fear our own death, you and I.

But there comes a time....

We are never quite prepared
for so many to die.

We do expect the occasional empty chair.
A salute to fallen comrades...

but this war goes on and on
and the men die...

and the price gets ever higher.

We are prepared to lose some of us,
but we are never prepared to lose all of us.

And there is the great trap, General.

When you attack,
you must hold nothing back.

You must commit yourself totally.

We are adrift here in a sea of blood,
and I want it to end.

I want this to be the final battle.

I woke up this morning and I half thought
he'd be gone, George Meade.

That he would not want to fight here.
Yes, sir.

I woke up and I thought,
"Meade will be gone...

"and this war will go on and on and on."

We'll make him sorry he stayed.

God go with you, General.

And with you, General.

That's mostly to the south.

I thought the rebs were all in Gettysburg.
You don't suppose they're flanking again?

Mama's favorite. Let's go.

Lawrence, what's happening?

Sir, Corporal Estabrook reporting back, sir.

-Brook, I thought you were on sick call.
-Yes, sir.

How are you now?

It's my stomach.
I've been throwing up, sir.

It's something you ate.

-Finish up. We're about to move out.
-Yes, sir.

-Colonel Chamberlain.
-Colonel Vincent.

Form your men.
Follow me and prepare to double-quick.

We're going to the top of that hill,
right there.

-You hear that?
-Yes, sir. I'll set it up.

The rebels are stacking up
on our left flank.

And we've got to follow them.

-Make haste.
-Yes, sir.

Sound the assembly!

Follow me.

Powder in! Load!

General.

Look here,
the ground is strewn with boulders.

The soldiers up there are entrenched
all over the ground.

And there are guns in the rocks.

Every move I make is observed.

If I attack as ordered,
I lose half my division.

And they'll be looking down our throats
at us from that hill right there.

We must move around to the right, sir.

And take them from the rear.

The commanding general will not allow
a flanking movement around those hills.

I argued it yesterday.
I argued it all morning.

I've been arguing against any attack at all.

I can't call this one off. You know it.

Let me move up the big round hill
to the south.

Nobody is on that.
If I could get a battery up there....

There ain't enough time.

You'd have to cut down trees
to place your artillery.

It would be dark before you were in action.

One the other hand,
if they get batteries up there...

we'll need buckets to catch the lead.
You've got to take that hill.

They don't even need guns to defend that.

All they need to do
is roll rocks down on you.

Just take it.

General.

I do this under protest.

Sam, you are the best I got.

Now, sir, if you are ready,
why don't you take that hill?

They're overshooting again.

Hey, fellows, you notice how
that reb artillery always overshoots?

-Tom?
-Yes, sir.

Another one a bit closer
and it could be hard day for Mother.

Go back to the rear.
Watch out for stragglers.

Keep your distance from me.

Lawrence, I don't....

The whole damn reb army is down there...

and coming up around our flanks.
They could be here any minute.

We've got to hold this place.
We've got to hold it.

Well, all right. I place you here.

Put your colors here, and set
your regiment to the left of this line.

The rest of the brigade
will form on your right. Understood?

-Yes. Ellis, this is the point.
-Sir.

Your regiment is to the left of this point.

-Colonel, sir. You're the end of the line.
-Yes.

You're the extreme left of the Union army.
Understood?

The line runs from here
back to Cemetery Hill...

-but it ends here.
-Understood.

You can't withdraw under any condition.

If you go, this line will be flanked.

If you go, the enemy will sweep up
over the hillside...

and take this entire army from the rear.

-You must defend this place to the last.
-Yes, sir.

Now we'll see how professors fight.

Ellis, position the regiment.
All company commanders here.

Yes, sir.

Sharpshooters to the left!

Battalion on the right!

Now file into line. March.

Bugler, sound the officer's call.

<i>"Hold to the last. " To the last what?</i>

<i>Exercise in rhetoric.</i>

<i>Last shell? Last man?</i>

<i>Last foot of ground? Last reb?</i>

Advance!

Move out!

Turn those guns around!

The 83rd Pennsylvania, 44th New York,
and 16th Michigan...

will be moving in to our right.
But if you look left, you will see...

that there is no one there.

Because we're the end of the line.
The Union army stops here.

We are the flank.

Do you understand, gentlemen?

We cannot retreat. We cannot withdraw.

We are going to have
to be stubborn today.

Put the boys in position,
tell them to stay down.

Pile the rocks up high
for the best protection you can.

I want the reserve pulled back
about 20 yards.

Sloping ground is good ground.

If you have any breakthroughs,
men wounded, a hole in the line...

plug it with the reserve.
How's our ammunition?

Sir, I think about 60 rounds per man.

That's good. 60 rounds. I think....
Yes, that's adequate.

Any questions?

Colonel.

It seems to me
the fighting is on that side of the hill.

It seems to me that we're the back door.

And everything's going on
at the front door.

That hill is steep and rocky. It's bare.
To come straight up it is impossible.

The reb army is going to swing around it.

It'll come up through that notch
right over there.

It'll move under the cover of trees,
trying to get around the flank.

And gentlemen...

we are the flank.

Gentlemen.

God go with you.

Captain Clark,
take the right side from the 83rd...

over in this direction to the center.

Ellis, take the left but be watchful.
Your flank will be in the air.

-Colonel, sir.
-Corporal Estabrook?

What do I do with these prisoners?
The hardheads of the Second Maine.

Do any of you care to join us?

-The rebs really coming?
-They're really coming.

Well, it's kind of dull
just sitting here watching, sir.

For any man who joins us,
there will be no court martial.

No man will call me a coward.

Why not?

I'll waste no man to guard you.
I expect you to be here when this is over.

-Let's get these fellows some muskets.
-There are no muskets, sir.

Wait here for a bit.

There will be guns available
in a little while.

That's the New York boys.
The rebs must be getting closer.

Must be moving this way.

Private Foss is praying.

-Will you put in a kind word for me?
-Yes, sir.

-You're the Merrill brothers, right?
-Yes, sir.

Boys, why aren't you on the ground?

Sir, I can't shoot worth a darn lying down.

Never could. Bill neither.
We like to fight standing.

I suggest you find a thicker tree.

Here they come!

I want you to stay with me,
but you keep down.

Buster!

I bet the whole damn reb army
is coming this way.

Walk down the line.
Tell the boys to get good cover.

Pile the rocks high and fire carefully.

-Go down and come back.
-Right.

You got to keep an eye on them.

Some of them load but never fire.
They just keep right on loading.

Some come home with
eight bullets rammed up the barrel.

Never fired a shot.

Sir.

Fire!

Keep up your fire, boys!

Keep your head down.

Watch your left side.

Keep up your fire!

They're falling back.

They'll be back in a minute.

-How are we doing?
-We're doing fine.

-Colonel.
-Captain Clark, anybody hurt?

-Head and shoulder wounds.
-They didn't hit the left.

They're moving out that way.
Can you see them, sir?

They're coming again, boys!

Colonel, look here.

A new regiment has arrived
that's moving against the left.

It's out there. Do you see them?

Double-quick!

I don't think we'll be able
to hold another one.

-Get all company commanders up here.
-On the double.

-Sergeant Owen!
-Yes, sir.

Get up to the top of that hill
and report me the situation from up there.

Yes, sir.

We're about to be flanked.
Here's what we'll do.

I want you to keep up
a good hot masking fire.

Keep a tight hold on the 83rd,
on old Pennsylvania over there.

I want no break in the line.

Captain Clark, that's you.
You understand? No breaks.

Right wing will sidestep to the left...

thinning out to twice the present distance.

You see the colors?
They will end up down to the extreme left.

When you reach that point,
we are going to refuse the line.

Understand?

We'll form a new line at right angles.

We'll pull up as much of a reserve
as possible.

We've got to be able to counter-attack
whenever there's a hole.

-Any questions?
-No, sir.

Fine. Move!

Lieutenant. You fellows, on the double.

Come on!

-How are you, Andrew?
-I'm fine, sir. And you?

A bit worn.

-The boys are putting up a hell of a fight.
-They are indeed.

I got me one. I got me a reb.

Buster! Are you all right?

I'll be fine in a minute,
but plays hell with me target practice.

The surgeon will see to it.

No. A little bandage is all I'll be needing.

A few minutes off my feet.
Me brogans are killing me.

Colonel, my men are getting low
on ammunition.

Go over to the 83rd.
Ask them to send what they can.

Lieutenant, go get from the wounded
and from the others anything you can.

-Pick up what you can from anywhere.
-Here they come, sir!

Keep up the fire!
Fill your holes down here!

There they go!

I'll be damned.

They keep coming!
How long are they going to keep coming?

I don't have much left. I got two shots.
That's what I got.

They keep coming on the flanks.
They keep moving to the left more.

They can't send help from the 83rd.
They say they got their own troubles.

-Colonel, sir! We'd like to report.
-What?

Vincent is badly wounded.

He got hit a few minutes
after the fight started.

We've been reinforced at the top of the hill
by Weed's brigade up front.

This is what they tell me.
But Weed is dead.

So they moved Hazlett's
battery of artillery up there.

But Hazlett's dead. Far as I can tell--

Can you can get ammunition
from up there?

I don't know. It's a mess.
But they're holding good.

The rebs are having a hard time climbing.

-It's a steep hill.
-We'll need the ammunition.

Colonel, sir, the better of my men
are wounded.

If the rebs come up that hill any stronger,
we can't stop them.

Send out word to take ammunition
from the wounded.

-Make every round count. Go!
-Here they come again!

Ready, boys!

Come on, keep it coming! Keep it up, lads!

Pour it on, boys!

Keep at them ! Keep up your fire!

Here they come, boys!

Go plug that hole over there!

Sir, half my men are down.

Most of the rest are wounded.
The left is too thin.

-How is our ammunition?
-Almost gone.

Sir, we're running out.
We don't have much left to shoot with.

Some boys got nothing at all.

What do we do for ammunition?

My boys had to pick up reb muskets
and fired back with them.

-We ought to pull out.
-No, we can't do that.

We can't hold them again, sir.

If we don't, they go right over the hill
and the flank caves in.

Here they come.

We can't run away.
If we stay here, we can't shoot.

So let's fix bayonets.

We'll have the advantage
moving down the hill.

They must be tired if we are.
So fix bayonets.

Ellis, you take the left wing.
I'll take the right.

Right wheel forward, the whole regiment.

-You mean charge?
-Yes, but here's what we do.

We're going to charge
swinging down the hill.

Just like we pulled back to the left side...

we'll swing it down like a door.

We'll sweep them down the hill
as they come up. Understand?

-Does everybody understand?
-Yes, sir.

Ellis, take the left wing.

When I command, the whole regiment
goes forward swinging down to the right.

All right, sir. Fine.

Move.

Bayonets!

Come on! Let's go! Move!

Quickly, boys! Quickly!

Let's go!

Bayonets!

Draw!

Bayonets!

Left swing, right wheel.

Right wheel!

Charge!

Charge!

Go!

The pistol.

Your prisoner, sir.

Wait here.

By God, Colonel,
the boys are still advancing.

-You better stop them.
-They're on their way to Richmond.

-Richmond!
-They've done enough for today.

I want you to meet
this fellow from Alabama.

Captain Hawkins, this is my brother,
Colonel Chamberlain.

Sir.

May I have some water?

Yes.

Sure. Tom, get this man a canteen.

Yes, sir. Right this way.

How you doing?

Twice!

Would you believe, for the love of Mary?

Twice.

And how are you, Colonel, darling,
this fine day?

I got it in the armpit.

For the love of God, in the bloody armpit.

How is he?

It's an arm.

Only an arm. You got to lose something.

It might as well be an arm.

I can part with that easier than other
mechanics of nature, and that's the truth.

I could do with a nip right now.

I'll see what I can do.

You do pretty good.

Colonel....

I'm right here, Buster. I'm right here.

The army was blessed.

I want to tell you, just in case...

that I never served....

I've never served with a better man.

Don't worry, sir.

He'll make it. He's a tough old mick.

Colonel, sir. It would so honor me.

Colonel, sir. I've been moving these rebs
with an empty musket.

That's allowed.

You're ordered to go to the top
of the big hill.

-My New Yorkers will take your prisoners.
-Yes, sir.

We watched from our position above.

It's the damnedest thing I ever saw.

May I shake your hand, sir?

Colonel, one thing.
The name of this place, this hill....

Has it got a name, this hill?

This is Little Round Top.
That's the name of the hill you defended.

The big one you're going up to,
that's Big Round Top.

Is that so? I guess I'll remember that.

Ellis, move the men out.
I'm going to go ahead.
