On the northeast tip of North America,
on an island called Newfoundland,

there's a airport.

It used to be
one of the biggest airports in the world.

And next to it is a town called Gander.

There's a two-person police department.
An elementary school.

An SPCA.
A local TV station.

And a hockey rink.

It's a small place
on a giant rock in the ocean.

Everybody knows everybody else.

And everybody in this room has a story
about how they started that day.

Welcome to the rock

If you come from away
Hep!

You'll probably understand
About a half of what we say

Hep!
They say no man's an island

But an island makes a man

'Specially when one comes
From one like Newfoundland

Welcome to the rock

That morning, I'm in the classroom.

It's our first day back,
and the school buses are on strike,

so I'm covering for Annette,
who's running late.

Sorry, Beulah. How's the kids?

Not exactly thrilled to be inside
on such a gorgeous day.

So I told 'em
we'd only have a half-day this morning.

They were quite pleased till I told 'em
we'd have the other half in the afternoon.

Welcome to the wildest weather
That you've ever heard of

Where everyone is nicer
But it's never nice above

Welcome to the farthest place
You'll get from Disneyland

Fish and chips and shipwrecks
This is Newfoundland

Welcome to the rock
I'm an islander

I am an islander

I'm an islander I am an islander

I'm an islander I am an islander

I'm an islander I am an islander

That morning, I'm in my car.

The kids cross Airport Boulevard
to get to school.

And that time of day, people are in
a bit of a rush to get to work and stuff,

so normally I sit there and run my radar.

And if they're speeding, I'll stop 'em
and write out a warning ticket.

I'll write "STFD"... "Slow The â™«â™«â™«â™« Down."

Welcome to the land
Where the winters tried to kill us

And we said
We will not be killed

Welcome to the land
Where the waters tried to drown us

And we said
We will not be drowned

Welcome to the land
Where we lost our loved ones

And we said
We will still go on

Welcome to the land
Where the winds tried to blow

And we said no

That morning, I drop my kids off at school
and head to the SPCA,

where I'm greeted by my other kids,

all barking and meowing
for breakfast and a belly rub.

Not that I'm complaining. I loves 'em.

But by the time feeding is done,
I gotta get back to pick up my human kids.

So I take just one second for myself.
And I'm sitting in my car.

I'm in the staff room.
I'm in the library.

And I turn on the radio.

You are here
At the start of a moment

On the edge of the world

Where the river meets the sea

Here

On the edge of the Atlantic

On an island in between

There and here

I'm an islander, I am an islander
I'm running my radar. Bonnie comes by.

I'm an islander, I am an islanderâ€¦
She pulls up, wavin' at me like mad.

So I roll down my window, and she saysâ€¦
Oz, turn on the radio.

Slow it down, Bonnie.
Jesus H., Oz, turn on your radio.

Where our stories start
It's my first day at the station.

Where we'll end the night
I'm getting coffee for the picket line.

Where we know by heart
Five minutes till my smoke break.

Every single flight
I'm off to work at the airport.

Welcome to the fog
Welcome to the trees

To the ocean and the sky
And whatever's in between

To the ones who've left
You're never truly gone

A candle's in the window
And the kettle's always on

When the sun is coming up
And the world has come ashore

If you're hoping for a harbor
Then you'll find an open door

In the winter, from the water
Through whatever's in the way

To the ones who have come from away
Welcome to the rock

I starts my day at Tim Hortons.

Don't drink coffee, don't drink tea,
and I've no use for donuts.

But I'll grab a Pepsi
and get a lay of the land.

As the mayor, it's how I keep in touch
with the people and such.

Everything starts and ends at Tim Hortons.

Morning, Garth.
Morning, Claude.

Morning, Crystal.
Morning, Mr. Mayor.

Dwight.
Morning, Claude, Garth, Crystal.

Claude, Crystal, Dwight, Garth. Morning.

Morning, boys. Pepsi?
That's right, Crystal.

Yeah.
What's the news?

School bus strike still on?
Yeah. We're working it out.

Well, we're coming to the table.

Well, we're coming to the table too.

They tearing down the airport?
Not today.

I heard Don Burton and his wife
won the Super 7.

You don't say.
Lucky shit.

4.6 million.

Excuse me, I'm looking for the mayor.

Mr. Mayor,
I'm Janice Mosher with Rogers TV.

I'm new to town and new to reporting.

It's my first day.
Where you 'longs to, Janice?

Port aux Basques.

So if you see me running red lights
or anything,

just forgive me because
we don't have stoplights over there.

Well, welcome to Gander, Janice.
Janice.

Janice.
Janice.

Janice.

If you're looking for news, you should
talk to that man running in here.

That's our constable, Oz Fudge.
He's full of stories.

Mr. Mayor, I saw your car in the lot.

Crystal, turn up the radio
so's we all can hear.

Doug, you probably wanna get down
to air traffic control right away.

There's only supposed to be
two air traffic controllers on,

but instead there's 14.

Everyone's heard, and they all shows up
without even being asked.

We're told there'll be over 200 planes
getting diverted across the country.

Lufthansa 414, this is Gander Center,
squawk code 7235.

Due to a recent development, you are
ordered to land at Gander YQX immediately.

Copy that. This is an order.

No, sir, you do not have a choice.

No, sir. This is not a drill.

Yes, sir.
I understand you have VIPs on board.

I'll see your VIPs
and raise you an international emergency.

Land your plane now.

Copy that, Gander Tower.
This is Air France.

Aer Lingus.
Lufthansa.

British Airways.
Emirates.

This is American four niner.
What am I supposed to tell my passengers?

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain.

There's been an incident
in the United States.

We're having trouble with theâ€¦
cabin lighting system.

We're just going to touch down
while we fix the system.

Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seat belts.

Looks like we'll be making an unexpected
landing in Gander, "New-found-land."

Anybody in the business knows when you
set down in Gander, it's for an emergency.

Now, we don't know what's going on,

but the captain tells us
to keep everyone from panicking.

Tray tables up, please.

We will be dimming the lights
in the cabin.

Pushing the light bulb button
will turn your reading light on.

However,
pushing the flight attendant button

will not turn your flight attendant on.

I look out the window
to see if there's something mechanical,

like if we've lost an engine
or something's on fire.

But I don't see anything.

I told head office I need to travel less.

I told them it was doctor's orders.

But they say, "You're going
to the conference," so you go.

My dad's always saying,
"Bob, you got to calm down."

But the flight attendant is
shaking like a leaf,

so I figure I've got permission.

My son sends me on this vacation.

He says,
"Mom, you've never gone anywhere."

And when I get back, I'm telling him,
"This is exactly why."

Suddenly, there's a drop.

A sudden change in direction.

I fly a lot, so I know that's not normal.

Outside the window, all I can see below
are trees and rocks andâ€¦ nothing.

On final approach,
we're coming into runway 22,

and I think,
"Where am I gonna park this thing?"

There are planes lined up like sardines.

And as far as I can see,
there's cars lined up too.

It looks like
everybody in Newfoundland is here.

One plane, then another

And then another

And then another

Is this on? Sorry. I'm new.
And then 13 planes, then another

And then another, and then another
This is Rogers TV Channel 9.

My name is Janice Mosher.
And then 19 planesâ€¦

I'm reporting live from Gander airport,

where the 19th plane
has just touched down.

I'm here withâ€¦

Bonnie Harris.
â€¦and then 26 planesâ€¦

On a normal day,
we get a half dozen flights,

and now we already got three times
that many landing in two hours.

It's a lot of noise.
â€¦and then 29 planesâ€¦

And you can smell the fuel.
You can smell the exhaust.

Jesus, that's a jumbo!
â€¦and then another

There's gotta be 250 or 300 on her.
And then 32 planesâ€¦

That's a fairly large one.
There's gotta be 200 on her.

Now I'm adding this up.
And then another, and then

We got 38 planes.
Thirty-eight, thirty-eightâ€¦

We got two, three hundred people
on the average!

Thirty-eight, thirty-eight planes

Holy shit!

Air Traffic Control says five of the
planes on the ground aren't responding.

Reg says they're probably
just on the wrong frequency.

Thank you, Dwight.

FAA won't give us a timeline
for reopening the airspace.

The airplane crews need to be rested,
or we'll never get them out of here.

American Trans Air flight number 25
is requesting, when they deplaneâ€¦

If they deplane.

â€¦that they be a priority.
Why?

They were headed to Disney World
with 90 Make-A-Wish kids.

Oh, Jesus.
Oh, my gosh.

Even with all the hotels in town,
we've got no room.

We gotta start looking at other towns.

Appleton and Gambo have already offered,
but we can't get them there.

Garth's bus drivers are
still on the picket line.

Without them, no one's going anywhere.

For Jesus's sake,
I'll tell them where to go!

Don't quote me on that.

I've got the SPCA lady on the line again
asking about animals.

Tell Bonnie we've got people to deal with.

Apparently those five planes
that aren't responding,

they're treating 'em as bomb threats!

All right!

The RCMP is gonna handle it.

But we've got almost 7,000 people
that might be spending the night.

Jesus, that's near as many
as we got living here in town.

We need to house them somewhere,
and we need to get them there.

Don't look at me.

Not to mention food and supplies
and anything else that snarls up.

Why are they sending them here?
Why not Toronto or Ottawa?

Because if anything goes wrong,
we have a lot less people to lose.

All right, Janice Mosher,
here's your news.

"Gander Town Council declares
a state of emergency."

11:53 a.m.
Tuesday.

September 11, 2001.

Any available community buildings will be
converted into shelters.

With thousands of passengers arriving
at any minute,

the town is asking for help with...

Well, anything you can do.

Crystal, I saw on the news
That they're looking

For blankets and bedding
And maybe some food

Do you know what they need
And how much?

I need something to do
'Cause I can't watch the news anymore

Can I help? Is there something?
I need to do something

To keep me from thinking
Of all of those scenes on the tube

I need something to do
'Cause I can't watch the news

No, I can't watch the news anymore

In the winter, from the water
Through the wind

If a stranger ends up at your door

You get on the horn

Hello, this is Beulah Davis
down at the academy.

I heard we might be getting someâ€¦ guests.

And I thought I'd see if I could help
whosever in charge of getting the school...

How many passengers can we take?

We fit about 400 students...

Yes, we could probably do 600.

Or, sure, 700 if we really pack 'em in.

When are they coming?
Could be anytime now?

I'm glad I phoned.

I get a call from Beulah,

looking for "anything 700 people
from around the world might need."

So I go down to Shoppers,

and the manager says
to just take what I want off the shelves.

Toothbrushes, floss, mouthwash, deodorant.

And I'm back at the school
when Beulah saysâ€¦

You know, those planes probably got
some babies on 'em.

So I'm back to Shoppers for diapers.

And we're unpacking them
when Annette saysâ€¦

You know,
those babies are probably gonna be hungry.

So I'm back to Shoppers
for formula and baby food.

And when I get back, Beulah saysâ€¦

Hey, you know, those planes are probably
filled with women of childbearing age.

Soâ€¦

So I'm back to Shoppers to pick up
as many pads and tampons as they have.

The Baptist church needs a hand
moving their pews.

Dr. O'Brien down at the pharmacy is ready
to fill any prescriptions.

And the Lions Club is looking for
some toilet paper, if you have any extra.

Medicine
Toothpaste

Underwear
Aspirin

Jackets
Our kids grew out of last summer

Down at the station
We're taking donations

Out by the door
Holy Jesus, there's more

It's better than being at home alone

Wondering what's really happening
Everyone's phoning

We're setting up rooms in the schools

Been crying all afternoon
Wondering what can be done

What do we need?

I made a tray of sandwiches.
We need 50 more.

Sandwiches?
Trays!

What do we need?

200 gym mats. Is that enough?

You tell me and we'll both know.

What do we need?

For the love of God, stop bringing
toilet paper to the Lions Club!

How do you know what you need

When you don't know
How many you're needing to feed?

When you don't know
How many are staying

How long they are staying

We better start praying
The weather stays nice

In the winter, from the water
Through the wind

In the winter, from the water

In the winter, from the water
Through the wind

In the winter, from the water

If a stranger ends up sent by fate

Are we gonna be ready?

Well, we have to be, don't we?

When you include the original flight,

we were on the plane
for probably 12, 13 hours.

We were on there 15 hours.

Twenty hours.

Twenty-eight hours.

We were on the plane
for over an entire day.

Twenty-eight hours

Over an entire day

There was one aisle in the middle

Everyone knew every inch of that plane

We were allowed out of our seatsâ€¦
Twenty-eight hoursâ€¦

â€¦but not off the plane.

You never think about it,
but airplane doors are 20 feet in the air.

And even if you survived the jump,
they probably would've shot you.

Everyone knew every inch of that plane.

You could go up to first class.
You could stretch in the aisles.

Our flight was full.
There were children sleeping on the floor.

It had three seats on each side.

There was only one aisle in the middle.

We had no way to get information.

This was before most people had
mobile phones,

and only a couple people got through.
â€¦every inch of that plane

Hello?
Mom?

Bonjour.
Operator?

Tom?

Thank God I finally got through

I borrowed a passenger's phone
How are you?

Are the kids okay?

No, I'm fine, Tom

I'm fine

Safe and sound on the ground
Here in Newfoundland

We don't know much
Except for the BBC...

Listen, I can't talk long

Can you do something for me?

I'm okay.
I'm fine.

Oui. Bien.
Pick up.

Tell the kids I'm all right

Take them into the kitchen

And show them the map
That we used to put pins in

For each destination
That we flew together

Tell them I'm fine

Put a pin here in Gander

On our plane, someone has a mobile phone.
But then the battery dies.

There are phones in back of the seats.
But they don't work.

Half the passengers on our plane
don't speak English.

Even if we knew what was happening,
we don't speak their language.

On our plane,
we ask the flight attendants.

But the captain says not to say too much,
and that's when rumors start flying.

There was an accident.
An accident?

The US airspace is closed.
For the first time in history.

Why won't she tell us what's happening?

A helicopter crashed in Pennsylvania.
Into a building.

Into the White House!
The White House was bombed!

We need to do something!
Everyone, calm down!

Oh, my God! It's World War III!

Meanwhile on our plane
We didn't have a clue

We were all going insane because
There wasn't squat to do

Then the captain starts apologizing

Says, "On behalf of the airline
I'm giving each and everyone some"â€¦

Complimentary booze

Open the airplane doors
Wave at all the cars

Hello to whoever you are

Wherever we are

The ground crews supplied
whatever we needed.

Nicotine patches.
Medication.

Pampers.
Something to drink!

So the flight attendants brought out
All the mini bottles of liquor

And delivered them to everyone

Soon everyone got friendlier

I took a couple of pictures
Of the view there with my camera

We didn't know where we were
But we knew that we were hammered

Open the airplane doors
Wave at all the locals

Surely there's something
Better to do than park

Wherever we are

We'd been sitting there for 14 hours
when we pull out the Grey Goose.

Kevin and I were kind of hiding it,
because...

'Cause we didn't wanna share it.

Anyway, this woman, this hot mess
behind us, kept completely freaking out.

Yeah, I don't understand
why they can't let us off.

I mean, just to stretch our legs.
I mean, really?

I need to get some air.

Oh, my God. I need to get off this plane!

And my boyfriend, Kevinâ€¦

We're both named Kevin.
It was cute for a while.

Anyway,
Kevin was not dealing with it well.

I'm going to kill her.

Excuse me!
I would like to get off the plane.

I am claustrophobic!

Excuse me. Would you like some Xanax?

Because you're freaking out,
and it is freaking me out,

and we are all freaking the freak out!

Open the airplane doors
Let a little air in here

'Cause I could use a shower or a bar
Or a bar

Open the airplane doors
Look at all the planes out there

There must be a convention
It's bizarre

Wherever we are
Twenty-eight hours

Twenty-eight hours
Out of the windows

Twenty-eight hours
Twenty-eight hours

Nothing but darkness

Twenty-eight hours
Twenty-eight hours

Darkness and headlights

Twenty-eight hours
Twenty-eight hours

Nothing to see

Hello? It's Bonnie Harris
down at the Gander SPCA.

I went down with the rest of the town
to look at all those planes.

Yeah. We are.

Well, I got to wondering
if there weren't any animals on them.

No?

There's no animals on those planes?

Not a one?

Yeah. Okay, then. Thank you for your time.

Doug.

Doug, are there animals on those planes?

Probably?

"Probably"?
Are they "probably" feeding them then?

I'm heading over.
Bonnie, there's armed guards.

The army. Police everywhere.

Well, then they'll have to shoot me.

Bonnie? Bonnie!

Garth. Look.
Claude. Look.

Look at it from my perspective.
Will you look at it from my perspective?

We've been coming to the table!
We've been coming to the table too.

We got the college, the churches,
and we got the hotels for the crews.

But we need your school buses!

We got no effing way to get them there.

Well, why don't you take 'em in your car?

Yeah, I can fit four in my Corolla.

That's a great start.
That's a great start.

Great. Think about it.
Great. No, you.

You think about it.
You think about it!

Jesus!

2:10 p.m. School bus drivers thinking
about leaving the picket lines.

What's the point of an emergency if
no one treats it like an effing emergency?

And you can quote me on that.

The flight attendants keep telling us
nothing's wrong.

But I got kids, and I got grandkids.
I know when someone's hiding something.

And when parents need their kids
to stop asking questions,

they start playing movies.

We ran through every movie we had.

Legally Blonde, Dr. Dolittle 2â€¦

and Titanic.

Near, far, wherever you...

Nothing to do Nothing to see

Thank God we stopped
At the duty-free

Wherever we are

Do you mind if I sit here?

I need to get some work done, and there's
some drunk people at the back of the plane

singing at the top of their lungs.

No, of course.

I'm Diane.
Nick.

How are you doing?

I'm worried about someone.

He was flying today.

I just wish there was some way
to tell him where I am.

Newfoundland.

No, you know that.
You just can't tell him. Right.

I'm hoping you're one of those people

who laughs when English people
say awkward things.

I just wish we knew what was happening.
What's happening?

What's happening?

Somewhere in between

Your life
And your work

When the world may be falling apart

And you think

I'm alone
I'm alone

And I'm so damn helpless

There's nothing left to do but drink

We open the airplane doors
Flash all the cars

I've never done that before

Twenty-eight hours gone

Over an entire day

Running out of things to say

And wondering
If there's someone going to clue us in

Tell us all what's happening

Because the sun is setting
And we're sitting in the dark

Wherever we are

Later that night, I'm up in the cockpit
with some of the other passengers

when the pilot puts the radio on
over the intercom,

and the whole plane goes silent
when the president gives his speech.

I ask the American people to join me
in saying a thanks

for all the folks who have been fighting
hard to rescue our fellow citizens,

and to join me in saying a prayer
for the victims and their families.

The resolve
of our great nation is being tested.

But make no mistake:

We will show the world
that we will pass this test.

God bless.

You got through to the airline

Tom, I'm okay

Tell me what's happening out there

How bad is it? Tell me everything

Tom, who was in the air?

No, no, I wouldn't have known them

No, no one on that airline

Charles? Are you sure?

No, I'm fine, Tom I'm fine

We can see 'em from the plane,

this long line of headlights
coming through the darkness.

Claude, can I have a word?

I don't have time to go in circles
with you anymore.

I got the army delivering
a thousand less cots...

Look, the union just voted.
You got your buses.

Our complaint's with our employer.

Not with the people on those planes.
Thank you.

But we're back on the line
the minute this is over.

Right.

Off of the airplane

Ladies and gentlemen,
take only your carry-on items.

Checked luggage will remain in the hold.

Into the airport

The captain and flight attendants
tell everyone

to take their blankets and pillows
off the plane.

Out of the windows

We grab bottles of water too.

No one has any idea
where they're taking us.

Darkness and trees

As we enter the airport, all those
car lights are still aimed at us.

We're scared. They're probably scared too.

The people here don't know what to expect
off of these planes.

The airport looks like something left over
from the Cold War.

And Kevin's likeâ€¦
Oh, my God. We've gone back in time.

The whole procedure,
the soldiers and all the formality,

just makes me really nervous.

Citizenship?
American.

British.

Purpose of your trip?

Vacation.
A conference.

Destination?

Dallas.
Texas.

Thank you.

Citizenship?

American.
Egyptian.

Purpose of your trip?

Family.

Business, just business.

Destination?

LA.
Dallas, then Washington, DC.

Thank you.
Could you come with me, sir?

There's a giant map
on the wall of the airport,

and someone has written in red marker,
"You are here."

Excuse me. I need to find a phone.
I need to call my son.

Well, the phones are over there.
But it's gonna be a while.

They're all lined up
at the airport pay phones,

so eventually we put
an "out of order" sign on 'em

just so we can get people on the buses.

11:48 p.m.

Buses and drivers are now taking
passengers to shelters.

Not just in Gander, but also to Gambo,
Appleton and farther communities

of Lewisporte, Norris Arm, and Glenwood.

Our bus sits there forever.
While all the others leave.

Finally, this otherâ€¦ passenger gets on.

This guy from the Middle East.

Someone says he got questioned.

Someone says he got searched.

And now he's on our bus.

I try to interview the Red Cross,
the Salvation Army,

but they've got more important things
to do than talk to me.

That's when I see them, the plane people,
through the bus windows.

The terror on their facesâ€¦

They have no idea where they're going.

They take me and my crew
in a separate van.

I'm looking out the window,
trying to see where we are,

but it is pitch-dark.

Now, I have flown over this area
hundreds and hundreds of times,

and it is just darkness,
hardly any lights anywhere.

And now here I am.

Oh, my God. This is just so remote!

Into the darkness
Stars and the moonlight

But all around us
Nothing but darkness

Out of the windows
Into the darkness

Darkness and trees

Every school bus we got
is goin' back and forth all night.

Out to the Salvation Army camp,

we've delivered passengers
from Germany, England and France.

On around 3:00 in the morning,
my bus is designated

to take all these African people
out there.

Into the darkness

My family and I try to see
out the bus windows.

No one tells us where we are going.

Onto a gravel road

Silence comes on the bus.

We get outside of Gander,
and you could hear a pin drop.

And all around us
My wife and daughter are scared.

They ask me what is happening,
and I do not know.

Behind me, this big man comes up to meâ€¦
Darkness and trees

â€¦and he says in this low voiceâ€¦

What?

Ladies and gentlemen,
we need some help translating.

If anyone speaks Mandarin,
can you come to the library?

And if anyone speaks Hindi,
could you please come to the cafeteria?

And if anyone speaks Newfoundlander,

well, Lard tunderin' Jaysus,
God bless ya, b'y.

We've got passengers from
all over the world coming off these buses,

all speaking different languages.
We can't even say hello.

And if anyone knows... We think it's...
Moldovan.

Moldovan, that would also be helpful.

Other passengers help us translate.

Mrs. Noonan, our French teacher,
turns out to know a little Russian.

And Mr. Michaels, our gym teacher...

Apparently he speaks Spanish.

I'm sorry, what was I saying?

I said you got five minutes, Bonnie.

There are hundreds of suitcases.

I can hear barking, but I can't find 'em.

They fast them before flying,
so they are starving,

and they need water.

Sir? Sir! Doug.

You gotta get out of there. We're keeping
all personnel out of the holds until...

Sorry, Dwight. It's the wife.

You know, Bonnie, from the SPCA?

She's feeding some animals inside.
Nothing's coming off.

I found a cat. His name is Lyle.

There's a pill taped to his carrier.

Well, I'm glad I got in here
to give it to him.

It's okay, Lyle.

Bonnie, I need you to get out of there.

Bonnie, you gotta move your arse!

Doug, I have found one cat.
Do you think it's Lyle who's barking?

No.

Here's some crunchy, Lyle.
I'll be back to give you your pill.

Listen to me. FAA sent over new orders.

We're treating all US planes
as bomb threats.

Oh, God. Bonnie!
Doug! Doug!

What? Bonnie? Bonnie, talk to me.
Doug! There are monkeys on this plane.

Climb aboard.
Hop right in.

You look some tired.
Nothing to worry about now.

We'll get you where you're going.

I'm guessing
you never heard of Gander before.

Well, that's it in the rearview mirror.

You'll need to reset your watches.

We've got our own time zone here.

Everything happens half an hour later
in Newfoundland.

You've all seen the airport. Used to be
the biggest airport in North America.

Planes used to stop here
to gas up from everywhere.

Frank Sinatra. Albert Einstein.
Muhammad Ali.

The Queen.

This is where the Beatles first set foot
in North America.

My father once went sledding
with Fidel Castro.

Then they invented jet planes that can
get across the ocean on one tank.

So there's no need to refuel anymore.

Leaving us with this giant airport.

There's talk lately about tearing it down.

Lucky for you,
we haven't got around to it yet.

Now, there's the reason I drive slow.

That there in the middle of the roadâ€¦

Yeah, that's a moose.

She'll move when she's good and ready.

Mind if I sit here?

The drunk people from our plane
are snoring back there.

Hello, Nick. Please do.

I thought we'd lost you.

No. I just needed to get
an emergency prescription filled.

My medication's in my suitcase.

Nothing serious.

Not like, "Oh, my God,
he's off his medication!"

I'll stop talking now.
It's fine.

It's heart medication. I've got
a slight arrhythmia. Nothing serious.

There you go,
everything you need to know about me.

Okay.

Well, I'm allergic to bananas.
And I've never had the chicken pox.

Any news yet about your husband
who was flying today?

My... No.

Do you mind
if we just don't talk about that?

I haven't been able to get to a phone.

I'm sorry.

I'll help you find a phone
as soon as we getâ€¦ wherever we're going.

Finally, out of the darkness,
my bus arrives at the Salvation Army camp.

We pass through a large gate,
and the bus pulls to a stop.

And through the windows,
out there in the darkness,

we see all these people
coming out of the buildings.

Now, we rarely use 'em,

but everyone's dusted off
their Salvation Army uniforms

to welcome these people.

There are soldiers everywhere.

The man at the front opens the door.

I say, "Here you are. Out you go."

But he's not moving. None of 'em are.

But then I notice his wife,
well, she's clutching a Bible.

Now, obviously, I can't read it.

But their Bible, it'll have
the same number system ours does.

So I askâ€¦ to see it.

And I'm searching for something here.

And then, in Philippians 4:6.

I give them their Bible, and I'm pointing,
saying, "Look, Philippians 4:6."

"Be anxious for nothing."

"Be anxious for nothing."

And that's how
we started speaking the same language.

Out of the darkness

Suddenly brightness

Everything changes

Darkness and trees

Out of the darkness

Suddenly light

Welcome to Gander Academy,
nicest hotel on the east coast.

Except for those with actual beds.

My name's Beulah.
Washrooms are just down the hall,

and there's food over there
if you're hungry

and clothes if you'd like to change.

I'll show you now
where you're gonna sleep.

Let us know
if there's anything else you need.

So, what really happened?

What's the last thing you heard?

There was an accident in New York.

Okay. I'm gonna show you now
to your rooms.

And then, if you want, you can come back.

We got two TVs set up in the cafeteria
with the news on,

so you can see what's actually happened
for yourselves.

I didn't even think.

They haven't seen any of it yet.

Lead us out of the darkness

We were all staring at those images.

And we just stand, helpless, watching 'em.

Lead us somewhere to safety

We barely know where we are,
but we know it's not there.

Lead us far from disaster

Charles Burlingame was the captain
of Flight 77

that crashed into the Pentagon.

I just saw him at a pub in London.

You can't imagine.

A pilot will fight to the ends
of the earth to save his airplane.

He just will.

Lead us out of the night

We watch those images for hours.

Until someone finally turns it off.

1:15 a.m.

Wednesday.
September 12th.

Crisis counselors are called
to Gander Academy.

The plane people, they're exhausted,
but they don't wanna sleep.

And we're standing there,
ready with all that food.

But that's not what they wanted.

They wanted phones.

1:45 a.m.

Six phones are put on tables

for the plane people to use
free of charge,

lined up alongside the road
by the NewTel building.

An hour later, they set up 20 more phones.

An hour after that, there's 75 phones
and computers with Internet,

all being used round the clock.

Hello? Yes, it's me.

Dad, I'm okay It's okay

I'm calling from Canada

Safe and sound on the ground
Here in Iceland

No, Newfoundland.
Yeah.

We just saw the news

Have you heard yet from Kev?
Or Celena?

Call Micah
And Lauren

My parents
My aunt

It's Di

No, I'm fine Where's David?

Thank God.

Hello. It's Nick Marson.

My plane's been diverted.

Can you pass on to someone at head office
that I'm fine?

No, no.
I just thought someone should know.

3:45 a.m.

Overnight, the community's population has
gone from approximately 9,000 to 16,000.

I'm sure
barely any of us have slept tonight.

We're hopeful that our visitors will be
back in the air come morning.

I woke up from a dream,
which I can't quite remember,

but there was this music in it
that I had heard somewhere before.

I woke up from a dream that we were stuck
in some backwater Canadian town

and that my air mattress deflated.

I woke up
to the smell of freshly baked bread.

4:00 a.m. in Newfoundland is
breakfast time in Germany,

and we got a lot of passengers here
from Frankfurt,

so breakfast starts at 4:00 a.m.,
and we start scrambling eggs.

Poached eggs, scrambled eggs, omelets.
Fried bologna.

Something called "toutons."

I saw a casserole dish
I don't think I could lift.

They made enough food
to feed 7,000 people.

It's like they never slept.

There's this one man
from the Middle East...

Well, we don't really know.
Hasn't said a word to a soul.

And some of the other passengers are
a little bit wary of him.

So it's a little odd to find him
poking around the kitchen...

Hello.
Hello. Can I help you with something?

Yes. I would like to be of assistance
with the food.

That's not necessary.
But I...

You go out there and sit down.

We've been going all night,
but we can't stop.

I splash some cold water on my face
and just keep going.

We've got 7,000 scared and angry people
who don't wanna be here.

And they're about to wake up.

In a crowded room
Filled with strangers sleeping

An airplane blanket
And pillow on the floor

The sun comes streaming
Through the window

And I can't sleep anymore

Staring at these strangers
Waking up around me

Sitting in a crowd of people
Waiting for the phone

And in a town
That's suddenly doubled population

I feel so alone

It's like any of us
Could have died on Tuesday

And like we're dared
To see things differently today

I'm feeling different
Distant

Strange
Who are these people here?

Where am I?
No one knows me here

Who am I if I don't feel
Like the me from yesterday?

I wake up in a crowded room
full of people sleeping on the floor,

and I see Diane and ask, "Are we leaving?"

Anytime now, yeah.

Is your hair different?

I mean, you look nice. I like it.

Well, thank you.
It's no shampoo for three days.

They start handing out clothes
to anyone who needs 'em.

I haven't changed my clothes in 39 hours.

I wanted to burn my socks.

Kevin puts on this plaid thing.

He says he's incognito and that
he's going to blend in with the locals,

but he just looks like a gay lumberjack.

Changing into
Another woman's donated set of clothes

Looking different
Feeling kinda different too

I can't quite explain
But when I woke

When David wasn't on that plane

It's like I changed into somebody else
But who?

And it's somehow like
We're at a costume party

And for a second you are not yourself

You are not yourself

And you look around
And blink your eyes

And barely even recognize

The person in the mirror
Who's turned into someone else

Hey, little sister.

Yeah, still here
where they eat rainbows for breakfast.

Are you taking care of Mom?

I'm just freaking out. I wish I was home.

No, not LA. Brooklyn.

Shut up. You're such a brat.

I just needed to hear your voice.

Excuse me. Are you Hannah?
Yeah, that's me.

My name's Beulah.
Someone told me your son's a firefighter.

Yeah, mine is too, here in town.

And I know Gander's not New York,
but is there anything I can do?

No. I just need to hear from my son.

I understand.

Praying for a phone call

Praying for a way home

Asking questions

Asking, "Can I get back
On that godforsaken plane?"

And all around me, people chat

And people act like nothing's happened

And I need to hear we're going back
Before I go insane

Good morning. I'm Captain Beverley Bass.

I know this is gonna be hard to hear.

The American airspace remains closed.

I can't tell y'all
how long we'll be on the ground,

but we are gonna be here for some time.

Here for some time
Here for some time

Here for too long
Here for how long?

When will we know?
When will we know?

How much longer?

Beulah, wait.
Can you help me find a Catholic church?

I can't sit here. I need to get some air.

Let's go see where we are.
It'll do you good.

No, what'll do me good is to lie down,
pretend this isn't happening.

Suit yourself.

And it's somehow like we're stuck here
At a messed-up costume party

And there's nothing here familiar

Far away from those you care for

On an isolated island in between

There and here
There and here

By the middle of the day on Wednesday,
I'm coordinating menus for 7,000 people.

Ladies and gentlemen, the Rotary Club
is looking for some fish dishes.

And we have a bunch of German passengers
down at the Moose Club

who would like to try elk.

No, sorry. That's the Elks Club
that's looking for moose.

Sorry. I'm new.

Well, if you won't try cod tongue,
we got cheeseburgers.

Or we got hot dogs too.

There's tuna casserole over there.

Or I could make you up a bologna sandwich.

Are there vegetables in Canada?

We're vegetarians.
I converted him.

Anyway, I notice this other passenger
who hasn't eaten anything at all.

Kevin is suddenly
in everyone else's business.

So I notify our hosts.

No. No, thank you. Please. I'm fine.

Turns out he's an Orthodox Jewish rabbi,
and he only eats kosher food.

Now, we have all kinds of people
living in Newfoundland:

Protestants, Baptists, Catholics,
Salvation Army-ists.

Not a lot of Jewish people.

The next thing I know,
I'm set up in the faculty lounge,

making a kosher kitchen
for any other Jewish passengers,

but also for two Hindu women,
some Muslims.

And a couple of vegetarians.

One of the pilots from Virgin Atlantic,
Captain Bristol,

he's a very strong leader.

He's good to his passengers,
and he's handsome too.

Anyway, he takes me aside and he saysâ€¦

I've been watching you.

You're doing beautiful work.

I'd like you to be my personal liaison
and work closely with me,

helping to handle anything I might need.

Annette!

What are you on about?
He did not say that.

Well, he said something like that.

Miss Beulah. Hello.

Hello, Ali.

May I ask, this food, what is it?

That's called cod au gratin.
"Cod oh grat"...

Fish with cheese.

It's fishâ€¦ with cheese.

Are you sure I cannot help you
with the food?

People start taking passengers
back to their houses to get cleaned up

and then inviting 'em to dinner,
then putting 'em up in their guest room.

Look, missus, I'm just 20 weeks along.

My Terry has already set up the nursery.

You and your little one'd be
much more comfortable there.

Thank you for shopping at Walmart.

Would you like to come back to my house
for a shower?

People are saying,
"We want you to come to our house."

And I think, what's up with this?

I mean, are they charging
for these "free" showers?

Or are they gonna go all Norman Bates?

Anyway, I wasn't falling for it.

But, finally, I'm invited back
to the mayor of Appleton's house.

That sounds fancy. But it's not.

There is a mayor for every town
of a thousand people in Newfoundland.

There's the mayor of Gander.
There's the mayor of Lewisporte.

There's the mayor of Gambo.

Anyway, I'm staying
with the mayor of Appleton.

Come on in, son.
The Irish whiskey's in the bar downstairs.

His wife shows me where my bedroom is
and where the shower is,

and through it all, I keep thinking,
"Where am I gonna leave my wallet?

Somebody's gonna steal my wallet."

Someone says there's a way out of here.
They say there might be a boat.

Kevin, we're on the other side
of the continent.

We're not taking a boat.

So I stop an officer and ask him.

How do I get back home?
Yeah, how do we get out of here?

Wellâ€¦ you take a taxi to the Goose.

There's a bus there to Port aux Basques,
leaves once a day. That's about six hours.

Once you're there,
you take the ferry across the gulf, right?

That's eight hours or so.

Then you catch another bus.

Not sure how often they leave,
but it's another eight hours to Yarmouth,

where you can get another ferry
to the US border.

That's another four hours or so.

And from Bar Harbor
you should be able to grab a Greyhound

to wherever you need to go.

It's about two or three days' travel,
but it's sure a nice view.

I don't leave the hotel.
I wait by the phone,

wait for someone to tell me
we can fly again.

Planes aren't made
to just sit on the tarmac.

Planes are made to be in constant motion.

They arrive, you switch crew,
you switch passengers,

you empty the Honey Buckets,
and the plane keeps going.

When they sit still for too long,
well, it's not good for 'em.

They start to break down.

Our pilot says we're not leaving
anytime soon. And Nick saysâ€¦

I might take a picture or two
before we go.

I finally convince Kevin to go for a walk.

There's four of us to begin with,

this Texan woman and this English guy

with a disposable camera
and a huge stick up his ass.

They're nice enough. Kevin and I are wary
of telling people we're together.

I mean, you just don't know
how redneck people can be.

This nice gay couple come along with us.

And we kind of make small talk.
They ask me what I do.

He works for this oil company in England,
and she was there visiting with her son.

Wait. You've got a son?

Yes. David,
the one who was flying on Tuesday.

She's going on and on about England

and how she didn't get to travel much
when she was married.

Wait. You're divorced?
Yes.

For a long time now.

What about you?
No, not divorced.

I mean, not that I'm married. I'm neither.

I travel a lot for work.

Kevin and I work
for an environmental energy company.

Well, it's my company.
Kevin's my secretary.

I'm his sexy-tary.

Anyway, we do a lot of green work,

so we generally hate people
who work in oil.

I just got the feeling that they hated me.

Then they wanna go into some old building
that looked like a shed.

Now, they'd heard it was a bar,

but I wasn't going into a bar
in the middle of the afternoon

with three men I just met.

And I think I'll stay with Diane.

You know,
instead of the gay men who hate me.

Doug is helping me feed the animals.

And after Security checks each plane,
slow as cold molasses,

we finally find eight dogs, nine cats,
one of whom is epileptic,

not to mention
two rare bonobo chimpanzees.

And the female bonobo is pregnant.

We have got to get them off these planes.

Yeah, hello? Is the mayor there?

It's Bonnie Harris again. Yes, I'll hold.

Airport Authority was pretty clear

about "no rare bonobo chimpanzees
on Canadian soil."

Doug, take that.
What is that?

It's rare chimpanzee shit.

What do you think it is?
Jeez.

Yes, the mayor... Yes, I'll hold.
I gotta get back to air traffic control!

Doug, look up.

Do you see anything flying?

I can't see across the friggin' Atlantic!
Just get more litter from the truck.

Get your own litter.
Fine, then goodbye.

No! No, no, no, not you. Hello? Hello!

Health Canada says
all this food needs refrigeration,

but we got nowhere to store it. None of
the shelters are equipped for this.

We're getting three more truckloads
of food tonight.

Stop 'em. We got nowhere to put it.
Then what do we feed people?

We also need that girl
at Rogers to announce

that Rotary, hockey, Boys and Girls Club...

Canceled until further notice.

Hold on!
Did you just say that hockey's canceled?

3:47 p.m. The town is asking
all bulk food deliveries be taken

to the Gander Community Center
hockey rink.

Since hockey's canceled,
the mayor is now calling itâ€¦

The world's largest walk-in refrigerator.

It's hot outside.

So we stay in the bar
and make small talk with Matty, the owner,

and his wife, Brenda.

But we're not sure how much to say.

You just don't know
where the red states are

in a foreign country, right?

But we had been drinking all afternoon,
and I accidentally say something likeâ€¦

Kevin and I have been together
for almost five years.

In business.
We've been together in business.

I'm his sexy-tary. Secretary.

It feels like the entire bar goes silent.
I'm like, "Oh, God."

And then Matty saysâ€¦
You'reâ€¦ gay.

I'm about to pass out.
But then Matty saysâ€¦

Well, praise be to God. My daughter's gay.

And then Brenda saysâ€¦

Sure, my sister's gay.

And the woman across the road just ran off
with her best friend.

And then Brenda's brother saysâ€¦

Our uncle is 68 years old,

and he just told us he's a bisexual.

We somehow ended up
in the gayest town in Newfoundland.

Kevin and I look at each other.

I think I say,
"There must be something in the water."

And then Brenda's brother saysâ€¦
That's why I only drink the beer.

Watching the news all day,
some of us are starting to lose it.

So these people here, they decide to have
a big cookout for the whole community,

just trying
to get our minds off of everything.

And Derm, the mayor of Appleton,
says to meâ€¦

Right, my son, do me a favor
and start to round up some grills.

Round up some grills?
Yeah.

Just go to people's yards
and take their grill.

Take their grill?
Someone's gonna shoot me.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Just go to people's yards
and grab their grill.

So I'm going from yard to yardâ€¦

and the whole time I keep thinking,
"Someone's gonna shoot me in the back."

Hello there.

Are you taking my barbecue?

This is your barbecue?
Yeah, buddy.

Listen, I'm so sorry...

The wife's got the kettle on,
if you want a cuppa.

I get offered a cup of tea
in every single backyard.

And most of 'em offer to help me
steal their own barbecues.

We bring 'em all over
to the community center, no names on 'em.

I don't know how they ever get 'em back.

But that's how we have a big cookout,
completely free.

After that, I stop worrying so much
about my wallet.

8:45 a.m.

Thursday.
September 13th.

We've got aâ€¦ situation
down at Gander Academy.

Ladies and gentlemen,
we have an indelicate request.

We need volunteers
to help clean the bathrooms.

As you can imagine,
with 700 adults in a primary school...

Health Canada needs us
to clean them everyâ€¦ hour and a half.

We just don't have the people.
So we're asking for your help.

But no one volunteers.

No one comes. And we're run off our feet
with everything else.

And thenâ€¦
Sweet Jesus in the garden!

This line of men comes walking
down the hall.

The top six cardiologists
from all over the world,

on their way to a conference.

Highly qualified cardiologists.

And they know about
the importance of cleanliness.

If we don't get these bathrooms clean,
we're going to haveâ€¦

bigger problems.

Anyway, I get lunch set up,

labeling anything that'll go bad
with the date and time.

I let the pants out for one of the pilots
who's been enjoying our cooking,

make a balloon animal
for a crying toddler,

and then I check on Hannah,
talking to anyone she can reach.

I am here

I am here on an island

Hello? Hello. It's me again.

Yeah, my son. He's with Rescue 2.

Any news?

I am his mother
I'm far away, stuck here

I'm trying to find out if...

Fine, I'll hold again.

I should be down there
And checking the hospitals

Putting up signs, doing something

Instead, I am here

I am here in Canada

I am telling you, listen
My son, he takes risks

He's not missing
He's helping or hurt

He'll get out of this

Yes, I'll keep trying
And, yes, here's the number

And, yes
At the grade school in Gander

I'll be here

I should be there
When it's over and done

When he comes through the door
And says, "I'm home, Mom"

I should be there for my son

But instead I am here

I am here

She leaves message after message
for her son

until there's no more room
on his answering machine.

All I know

Is you are there

You are there

And I am here

She finally got some news.

They said it was Kev's day off.

But someone else said there were more men
down there than were scheduled.

I should be looking for him.

He's always there for me,
trying to make me laugh.

Tells me stupid jokes. He loves jokes.

Tells 'em to the kids at the firehouse
as he fixes their bikes.

I should be there.

I know there's nothing I can do to help.

But I do know a few jokes.

There was this sailor
who was stationed in the South Pacific,

far away from his wife,
who he'd just married.

And when he was away,
he wrote her a letter.

He said,
"We're gonna be apart for a long time,

and this island is full of young,
attractive local girls.

I need something to take me mind off 'em."

So his wife sends him an accordion

and says,
"Why don't you learn to play this then?"

So finally he comes home
from his tour of duty

and he says to his wife,
"I can't wait to get you into bed."

And she says, "First, let's see
how well you play that accordion."

That was a really stupid joke.

Tell me another one.

Everywhere you look
there are people from around the globe,

going back and forth
for phones and showers,

grabbing something from Shoppers.

I'm getting a coffee
at a gas station on the main drag,

when suddenly the entire place goes quiet.

And nobody moves.

Even the people outside are still.

And I look up at the TVsâ€¦

and I realize.

It's a national moment of silence
in America.

And all these Newfoundlanders,

these people from another country,
they maintain that moment of silence.

I don't know
if that would happen back home

at a busy gas station on the main drag.

But it happened here.

Beulah walks me to church.

And when we get there,
I light a candle for my son.

And I do too.

I suddenly realize what that music was
from my dream.

It was an old hymn from when I was a kid.

Well, I haven't been to church in years,

but for some reason,
that song was in my head.

Make me a channel of your peace

Where there is hatred
Let me bring your love

Where there is injury
Your pardon, Lord

And where there's doubt
True faith in you

Make me a channel of your peace
Make me a channel of your peace

Where there's despair in life
Let me bring hope

Where there's despair in life
Let me bring hope

Where there is darkness, only light
Where there is darkness, only light

And where there's sadness
Ever joy

There's a man here in town.

He's lived here nearly his entire life.

He heard that
there was a rabbi diverted here,

and he came to find me
and tell me his story.

I was born in Poland, I think.

And my parents, they were Jews.

They sent me here before the war started.

I still remember
some of the prayers they taught me.

As a boy, I was told I should never tell
anyone I was Jewish. Even my wife.

But after what happened on Tuesday,
so many stories gone, just like that,

I needed to tell someone.

During al-fajr,
when most people are asleep,

it is easier to pray.

But at zuhr, I can feel them watching me.

Sometimes I catch them
when they think I'm not looking,

and I can see the fear in their eyes.

Excuse me.
Beulah wanted me to check on you.

The library's open for anyone looking for
some peace and a quiet place to pray.

O Master, grant that I may never seek

So much to be consoled as to console

To be understood as to understand

To be loved
As to love with all my soul

Make me a channel of your peace

Where there's despair in life
Let me bring hope

Where there is darkness, only light

And where there's sadness, ever joy

Health Canada finally lets the animals off
and quarantines them to hangar 1.

It's a big room
of cats and dogs and chimpanzees.

There's barking and meowing,

and then the chimps start
imitating the dogs,

and they're barking too.

The phones are ringing off the hook
with people who wanna see their pet.

But they're not allowed
anywhere near the planes.

And I am worried about Unga,
the pregnant bonobo.

All animals are affected badly by stress,
not just humans.

Some people spend their days
crammed inside, shoulder to shoulder,

with nothing to do but watch the news
and wait for something to happen.

On the edge

We got the TVs going 24-7
in the cafeteria,

and the more they watch,
the more scared and angry they get.

On the edge of the

Some of the plane people haven't slept
in three days.

None of us have either,
and we're jumping at our own shadows.

On the edge of the world

Around suppertime on Thursday,
people are waiting to use the phones,

and there's a fight in the hallway.

Hey. Hey, what the hell are you saying?

I beg your pardon?
You celebrating this?

You praying for your friends?

Why doesn't he speak English?
Excuse me?

Telling your Muslim friends
where to bomb next?

This was not all Muslims. I wasn't...
Go back where you came from!

I'm Muslim, and I was born in Connecticut.

She's an American citizen!
Don't look American!

On the edge of the world
Or wherever we are

We are, we are
We are on the edge

Is there something?
I need to do something

To keep me from thinking
Of all of those scenes on the tube

I need something to do
'Cause I can't watch the news

No, I can't watch the news anymore
On the edge

The FAA keeps delaying
opening the airspace.

And here on the ground we're dealing with
a whole mess of other problems.

On the edge of the

Some of the planes are parked on a runway
where the surface is all torn up.

That debris gets into an engine,
and they'll never leave.

On the edge of the world

One of the big planes, a Triple Seven,
is sinking into the asphalt.

If we don't do something,
she'll be stuck here forever.

On the edge of the world
Or wherever we are

We are, we are, we are on
We are, we are, we are

We are on the edge!

I interview a woman from Queens. A mother.

Her son is a firefighter,
and they still can't account for him.

She starts crying, and I start crying too.

And I can't stop shaking.

I don't know if I can do this anymore.

I check in with Air Traffic Control again,
and it's more bad news.

Not only is the airspace still closed,

but there's a storm
headed for Newfoundland.

Hurricane Erin is making landfall
tomorrow or the day after.

If we don't get these planes
in the air soon, no one's going anywhere.

Claude, people are starting to crack.
Let's get everyone down to the Legion.

Everyone's going to the Legion
for a drink.

Hi, have you seen my boyfriend?
His name's Kevin.

He's about that tall,
and he's lost his mind.

I just wanna go out.
Well, I don't.

Well, I'm not going without you.
Well, I'm notâ€¦

staying for a long time.

One drink.
One drink.

Hannah, everyone's going out tonight.

You go on without me, Beulah.

I need to wait by the phone.

I'll wait with you.

I keep waiting to hear from the airline,
so I'll just be here by the phone, Tom,

if the kids wanna speak with me.

Bonnie?
I know you're not leaving the animals,

so I brought you some chili.

But I really think you should come home
and get some sleep...

Doug! Get in here.

We are about to have the first rare
bonobo chimpanzee born in Newfoundland!

Beulah! They need some food
down at the Legion, if you can spare any.

Miss Beulah,
please let me help with the food.

No, my love. You're a guest.

Please. I am a master chef
for an international hotel chain.

I oversee restaurants around the world.

I would like to help with the food!

Get in there!

Everyone's going out to the bar.
And Nick is going.

I'm going if Diane is going.

And I think, "Nobody here knows me.
I can be whoever I wanna be."

I'm not worried about my wallet.
I'm not worried about getting shot.

I am a little worried
about how much Irish whiskey I'm drinking.

By eight o'clock, the bar is completely
packed with people from around the world.

Everybody's talking about where they're
staying and what they've seen,

and the bar staff keep making runs
for more beer and liquor.

After an hour,
people are swimming in the river out back.

And no, no one brought their swim trunks.

Couple of the local boys get up
with their accordions and fiddles.

And someone brings out an ugly stick.

Yeah!

Farewell to all you pretty ladies
Waving from the dock

Heave away, me jollies
Heave away

And if we do return to you
We'll make your cradles rock

Heave away, me jolly boys
We're all bound away

Farewell, you Newfoundlander boys
You're leaving us alone

Heave away, me jollies
Heave away

And if you find another
We've got lovers of our own

Heave away, me jolly boys
We're all bound away

Then we get the karaoke going.

Near, far

Wherever we are

Then we decide to have
a bit of a ceremony.

Let's make these people
honorary Newfoundlanders!

Now, there's a solemn old tradition
For admission or audition

To transition
From a come from away

To be a Newfoundlander

The only other way, at any rate

Is pass away and pray to fate

And wait to reincarnate

As a Newfoundlander

Hey, hey, come on inside
Nothing ventured, nothing tried

Only a couple of people cried

You'll be a Newfoundlander

Hey, hey, sit down right there
You'll feel better in a year

Try to ignore your doubts and fears

And you'll be a Newfoundlander

Now we needs a couple of volunteers.

Who wants to become a Newfoundlander?

Right here!

Good man! Who else?

I have no idea why I put up my hand.
And Kevin's likeâ€¦

Oh, my God. Are you serious?
Oh, my God. You are serious.

Yes, I'm serious.

Don't do it if you don't want to.
I won't.

Where you from, buddy?
Los Angeles.

LA! Who else?

Us! We wanna be Newfoundlanders.

All right. Where you folks from?

Texas...
Texas!

What part of Texas you from, buddy?
No, no. I'm...

I'm from Texas. He's from England.
Well, wait.

Now, how does that work?
What?

How does what work?
How does your marriage work?

With you being in England, her in Texas.

We're not married.

I'm sorry. I assumed you were married.

No, no.
No.

Well, would you like to be?

Well, why not?

Diane had had two beers by then,
so it was probably the alcohol talking.

I've never had more than one beer
at a time before,

so it's probably the alcohol talking.

I went and got us two more beers.

Now, the first part is the easiest
We'll soon get to the queasiest

I'll need you to repeat this mess

When you become a Newfoundlander

'Cause we speaks
A different language, son

We adds some esses and some rum

You'll have to try a good cod tongue

When you become a Newfoundlander

Hey, hey, just do your best
Nothing scary, nothing yet

You'll have to change
The way you're dressed

And you'll be a Newfoundlander

Hey, hey, just sing along
Nothing ventured, just prolonged

There's 30 verses in this song
And you'll be a Newfoundlander

Ladies and gentlemen, this is Screech.

Back in World War II,
an officer was stationed here

and was offered some of this stuff.

All the locals were tossing it back
with nar' a quiver,

so he does too
and lets out an ear-piercingâ€¦

Everybody comes to see what's happened
and saysâ€¦

"What was that ungodly screech?"

And now it's your turn. Are you ready?

No, I'm not ready.

No thank you.

All together now! One!
One!

Two!
Two!

Three!
Three!

Down the hatch!

Screech is basically bad Jamaican rum.

Screech is horrific.

Screech is delicious!

And then they brought the cod.

The cod!

The cod?
The cod!

Now, with every transformation
Comes a tiny bit of risk

You gotta walk the plank

And there'll be blood
Or there'll be bliss

And it's the same to be a Newfoundlander
Every person's wish

So don't be dumb
Just take the plunge

Go on, kiss the fish

I'm an islander, I am an islanderâ€¦

Ladies and gentlemen, this is a genuine
freshly caught Newfoundland cod.

And if you want to become
an honorary Newfoundlander,

you'll have to give her a smooch!

â€¦I'm an islander, I am an islanderâ€¦

If you kiss that,
I will never kiss you again.

I'll risk it!
Two!

I am not kissing a fish!

Come on! I will if you will.

Oh, my God. Fine.

â€¦I am an islanderâ€¦

Three!

I can't do it.

Come on!
What? I just did!

Now, you gotta kiss the cod.
It's a vital part of the ceremony.

I can't do it.

All right, look, I'll make you a deal.

Either you kiss this fish

or else you kiss this Englishman
that you're not married to.

Wait, what?
Okay.

Hey, hey, come on tonight
Take a risk and take a ride

Jump right in with both feet tied

And you'll be a Newfoundlander

Hey, hey, come on once more
Nothing ventured, nothing sore

After it's over, out the door

And you'll be a Newfoundlander

After it's over

You'll remember

That you're a Newfoundlander

Hey! Good job, LA.

Good night, now!

Kevin?

Where did you go?

Kevin?

My parents must have thought
They had a crazy kid

'Cause I was one of those kids
Who always knew what I wanted

They took me down to the airport
To see all the planes departing

Watching them fly
Something inside of me was starting

I was eight when I told 'em
That I'd be a pilot

But I was too young and too short
And there were no female captains

And my dad said, "Be patient"
He said, "Just see what happens"

But I took my first lesson
Came down from the sky

And told my father I'd fly
For the rest of my life

And I got my first job
Flying for a mortician

In a tiny Bonanza
Just a corpse and me

Five dollars an hour
For flying dead bodies

I had to climb over their faces
Just to get to my seat

And suddenly the wheels lift off

The ground is falling backwards

I am suddenly alive

Suddenly I'm in the cockpit

Suddenly everything's changed

Suddenly I'm not
Too young or too short

And the passengers
In the back don't complain

Suddenly I'm flying company charters

Suddenly everything's high

Suddenly there's nothing in between

Me and the sky

American Airlines
Had the prettiest planes

So I applied as a flight engineer

But the World War II pilots
They all complained

They said
"Girls shouldn't be in the cockpit"

"Hey, lady. Hey, baby. Hey!
Why don't you grab us a drink?"

And the flight attendants
Weren't my friends back then

And they said
"Are you better than us, do you think?"

But I kept getting hired

And the World War II crew
They retired

And the girls all thought
Much higher of me

1986, the first female
American captain in history!

Suddenly I'm in the cockpit

Suddenly I've got my wings

Suddenly all of those pilots
Protesting me

Well, they can get their own drinks

Suddenly there's no one saying
"Stay grounded"

Looking down, passing them by

Suddenly there's nothing in between
Me and the sky

Suddenly I've got an all-female crew

The news caught
And made headlines across the world

Suddenly it stopped

No one's saying
"You can't"

Or
"You won't"

Or "You know you're not anything
'Cause you're a girl"

Suddenly I'm getting married

And we're putting pins on a map
Where we've flown

Suddenly I am a mother

And suddenly shocked
At how much they've grown

Suddenly I'm wondering
How my parents would feel

Seeing me teaching men to be pilots

'Cause suddenly I am
A senior instructor

And somehow I'm 51

Suddenly I'm flying Paris to Dallas

Across the Atlantic and feeling calm

When suddenly
Someone on air-to-air traffic says

"At 8:46
There's been a terrorist action"

And the one thing
I loved more than anything

Was used as the bomb

Suddenly I'm in a hotel

Suddenly something has died

Suddenly there's something in between

Me and the...

Hello? I'm on my way.

1:34 a.m.
Friday.

September 14th. Shelters will be alerted
as each plane is cleared to go.

Our pilot says to pack up.

It's sudden notice. Middle of the night,
and we're leaving in an hour.

But these people,
they make these bag lunches

and form a gauntlet handing 'em out.

And we all walk through it,
get our lunches

and say goodbye to all of 'em.

We try to give 'em money,
but they won't take it.

No, m'son. You would've done the same.

I drank all your whiskey.
I would've done the same.

Good morning.

You were snoring.
My head hurts.

You had a couple.

Did I kiss the fish?

What, don't you...

Yes, you did.

Good. Wait...

We're running out of time.
Our plane could be the next one to go.

Our plane could be the next one to go.

Are you still upset that I kissed a fish?
No.

I'm upset because I left the bar
and you didn't even notice.

You left without telling me.
After everything that's happened,

you're out there acting like it's okay,
and it's not okay.

I know!

But I'm not just gonna shut myself inside.

Let's just get back to LA.

While you're in Dallas,
I'd love to have you over.

I tried to change my flight to New York.
They wouldn't do it.

My conference was canceled,
so I head back to London immediately.

I don't understand. Why would...
I just need to be back home.

Back home.
Back home?

Back home?

Well, all good things, right?

As the plane people leave,
they keep stopping us, thanking us,

trying to give us money. But we say...

No, buddy. You would've done the same.

But one guy keeps insisting
until Beulah finally tells himâ€¦

Look, you can slip it
in the suggestion box down at town hall.

But, honestly, we're happy
with a thank-you on your way out.

Captain Bristol,
that pilot from Virgin Atlantic,

he comes to find me
to help him round up his passengers.

Annette, my darling.

Before I leave, I need to thank you
for everything we've shared.

Though I travel home today,
I leave my heart behind.

Annette!
Don't.

Get...

Goodbye! Take care!
Bye now!

Take care now!
Tell us when the baby's born!

Don't be a stranger!

We get down to the airport,
and it's chaos.

Passengers dropped off
from multiple flights.

Every bag has to be emptied.

No scissors, no nail clippers.

If any bags are unidentified,
they'll be blown up.

Then someone says
there's issues with security.

One of my flight attendants comes
to find me, and she saysâ€¦

There's a Muslim man on our flight.

I saw him praying,
and he's been acting suspicious.

He doesn't have a carry-on, and...

I'm not getting back on that plane
with him.

I arrive at the airport
and am pulled out of line.

I am responsible for the safety
of my passengers and my crew.

And Security tells me that any perceived
threats must be taken extremely seriously.

They bring me into a private room,
and he's brought in for questioning.

At first, I do not understand
what the police are asking.

And then I do.

In my culture, there is a word, awrah.

The area between your stomach
and your knees.

It is forbidden in my religion
for anyone to see this but my wife.

To have a woman in the room watching this,
watching meâ€¦

You can't understand.

It is the most thorough body search
I've ever witnessed.

When it's over, I find him and tell himâ€¦

I am so very sorry that happened.

Am I free to go now?

When are we leaving?

Good morning!
We are one of the first flights to leave,

which makes us one of the lucky ones,

as some planes may still be here
for quite some time.

Now, I have no control over this.

You have paid for a flight
from Paris to Dallas,

and if I get clearance,
I'll take you to Dallas.

But if I am not cleared for Dallas,
I have to take you back to France.

But we will make arrangements
as quickly as we can

to get y'all back to the United States

and where you need to be.
No, no. I can't go back.

I just adopted my daughter,
and if I don't...

Hey! Hey! We can vote on this!

We can make 'em go where we wanna go.

Well, who is for Dallas?

Screw that! Who's for Switzerland?

This is not a democracy!

I am the captain, and this is coming
from American Airlines and the FAA.

You are not voting on our destination.

Now, if we have any situation
that needs to be dealt with,

we will be pulled out of line,

and then we will be
the last flight to leave.

Thank you for your cooperation.

After hours of waiting, they tell us
we're not leaving yet after all.

4:18 p.m. There's a 747 with a flat tire
blocking the runway.

All planes are stopped.

No one's taking off.

Welcome back!

We're told by our pilot
to stay close to our shelter

so we're ready to go again.

But Diane wants to take
one last look round.

And I can't let her go by herself.

And we find a gorgeous lookout.

The Dover Fault.

There's about a million stairs.

It's beautiful.

Nick! You gotta see this.

Wow!

I can't believe we're here.

I know.

I can't believe we're leaving.

I don't want to go.

What did you say?

I don't know. I...

I'm going to take a picture or two.

Okay.

Stop the world Take a picture

Try to capture
To ensure this moment lasts

We're still in it
But in a minute

That's the limit
And this present will be past

So here we are
Where the world has come together

So here she'll be
In this picture forever

Look at this.

540 million years ago, the continents
of the world crashed together right here.

And 200 million years ago,
they separated again,

moving apart from each other...

But a little part of them was left behind.

I should move.
You're missing all the scenery.

No, no, no. Stay where you are.

Really?
Really. It's perfect.

Stop the world Seize the moment

But the minute he goes
You're alone and it's through

Pinch yourself

Tell yourself
You're just dreaming

That means he'll forget about you

But here we are

Where the continents
Once crashed together

Before they went
Their separate ways forever

So stop the world
Stop the world

Stop the world
Stop the world

Stop the world
From spinning round

I'm on a lookout

Overlooking something

Worth taking the time
To stop flying by

And look down
Stop the world

Stop being scared
And look round

And look round
Stop the world

Just tell him now
Just tell her now

And look now

Take a picture of the scenery

Of a lookout
Of a moment which is over

Of the ocean, of the river

Of the trees

Stop the world please

9:35 a.m.

Saturday.
September 15th.

Finally, they get the planes going again,

and I go down to tell the Make-A-Wish kids

that they're being sent home
without getting to Disney World after all.

But they're not sad about it.
They're going on hayrides, canoe rides,

and someone dresses up as the town mascot,
Commander Gander.

And it turns out
if they'd made it to Orlando,

they would've had four days of rain.

I am just doing one more litter scoop,
then I'll get them on their planes!

Lyle.

You're a beautiful cat.

I taped your pill bottle to your carrier
and made sure someone will see it.

You did good. You're gonna be fine.

Yeah, Ralph, you're a good cocker spaniel.

I know the night security crew
ran you a bit ragged,

so I want you to get some sleep
on the plane, okay?

Okay.

Unga.

I never met
a rare bonobo chimpanzee before.

We don't get many of 'em
here in Newfoundland.

And since your partner there likes
to throw his own feces,

I'm gonna say you're the nicest
rare bonobo chimpanzee I ever met.

And I want you to know I'm sorry.

I'm sorry you lost your baby.

I got three. Some days
they are more trouble than they are worth.

Anyway, you're gonna be okay.

The winds start to pick up.
50-mile-an-hour winds.

We have been here too long.

We're still on the ground,
there's a hurricane coming,

and I'm thinking,
"We're running out of time."

We have to leave. We have to leave now.

One plane, then another

And then nine planes, then another

And then 13 planes, then another
Nineteen planes, then another

Twenty-two, twenty-four
Twenty-nine, thirty-two

Thirty-eight, thirty-eight
Thirty-eight, thirty-eight

Thirty-eight, thirty-eight
Thirty-eight, thirty-eight

Thirty, thirty, thirty-eight planes

Ladies and gentlemen
If you look out your windows

Underneath all that rain is Maine

We've just crossed the Canadian border

Welcome back to the US of A!

Looking out the window
At the world underneath

And though he's here next to me
In a second, he'll go

Looking out the window
Kevin, talk to me, please

And out the window we see
A place we all know below

Is this on? It's on.

Sorry, everyone... Hi!

Like most everyone
I am sorry saying goodbye

So I wanted to thank them
For all that they did

So I'm doing just that
And I'm passing a hat

For the people who gave up their time

And they gave up their town

So let's give 'em a scholarship
Pass the hat down, 'cause

Somewhere
In the middle of nowhere

In the middle of who-knows-where
Who knows

There you'll find

Something
In the middle of nowhere

In the middle of clear, blue air

You found your heart
But left a part of you behind

Nick and I sit together,
and I just... I wanna say something,

but we're leaving, and it's over.

Then she starts crying.
I don't know what to say.

So I just put my arm round her and go to
kiss her on the forehead to comfort her.

Well, and there was some turbulence,

and, honestly,
I just thought he missed. So Iâ€¦

Ladies and gentlemen
If you look out your windows

You won't wanna miss this
We just entered Texas!

Somewhere
Somewhere

In the middle of nowhere
Nowhere

In the middle of who-knows-where
Who knows

There you'll find
Find something in the middle of

Something
Something

In the middle of nowhere
Nowhere

In the middle of clear, blue air

You found your heart
But left a part of you behind

Everyone's drinking and comparing stories.

Where did you stay? What did you do?

But mostly Nick and I spend the
plane ride home canoodling in the back.

At one point,
a flight attendant comes round sayingâ€¦

Hot towel?

Hot towel?

Cold towel?

Somewhere in between

The pace of life and work
And where you're going

Something makes you stop and notice
And you're finally in the moment

Somewhere
In the middle of nowhere

In the middle of who-knows-where
Who knows

There you'll find

Something
Something

In the middle of nowhere
Nowhere

In the middle of clear, blue air

You found your heart
But left a part of you behind

Ladies and gentlemen
Put your seats back and tray tables up

Right below us is
The city where I grew up

Coming round, past the field
Then the wheels touch the ground

Taxiing
Home, America

We're all cheering, we're down
Home in America

Thanking everyone
Home, America

"Thank you for flying American"
Home in America

Hugging them, hugging my crew
Home, America

'Cause we're home again
Home in America

Past the gate, up the stairs
Home, America

And we're there
Home in America

And he's waiting in line
Home

No, I'm fine, Tom

I'm fine

Soâ€¦
Soâ€¦

So you'll call?

As soon as I get back.

And then she left.
And then he left.

And then I was alone.

Back to the way that things were

Back to the simple and plain

For five days
The weather had been so nice

But as they boarded
It started to rain

At the end of the day
After everyone left

We all tried to go back to normal
Except

The town was more quiet
And somehow far emptier

We all looked the same
But we're different than we were

The gym was a sight
As I stacked the last cot

Thank-yous written everywhere
And things they forgot

The board of health says
"Clean it up, every part"

So we start

7:42 a.m.

Sunday.
September 16th.

After five days, they just ran the Zamboni
over the ice and played hockey.

With the plane people gone,

I tell my staff,
"Go home. Get some sleep."

We were all exhausted, just spent.

Most of us had been up
for five days straight, working.

But somehow I can't sleep.

So I sit down, turn on the television,
and I just start crying.

I hadn't let myself cry the whole time.

Something's gone

Out the airplane window,
I can see Manhattan,

and there's still smoke.

And suddenly I'm afraid all over again.

And there are others afraid too.

Something's over

I know Newark Airport.

You could pull a truck over
on the side of the turnpike

and shoot a grenade launcher
at a plane coming in.

Something's done

But nothing happens.

I drive Kevin back to his place.
We don't say much.

Something's missing

I go straight to his firehouse.

Part of me wondered
if they just weren't telling me.

But they still don't know.

Something's changed

My flat is the same as I left it,
but emptier.

Quieter.

I start to unpack, and I find the camera.

Something's rearranged

On the way to my restaurant,
I drop my daughter at school.

But she won't go in.
She says she's scared.

What do I tell her?

Something's strained

Back at my dad's house,
I look out the window

at this view I've looked at my whole life.

And now a part of itâ€¦ Something's missing.

Something's missing

Kevin breaks up with me.

And then he quits
and moves back home to New York.

And I miss him.

I miss his jokes.

Something's lost

Nick and I call each other when we can,
but it's awful.

The only reason we met was
because this terrible thing happened.

Some things cost

I go down to ground zero, which...

It's like the end of the world.
It's literally still burning!

Something's not

My dad asks, "Were you okay
out where you were stranded?"

How do I tell him I wasn't just okay,
I was so much better?

Something's missing

I phone American and say, "I'm ready to go
wherever you want to send me."

But they say, "Take a few days off."

I phone every day,
and I am back in the airport by Thursdayâ€¦

and it's empty.

Silent. It's just a different place.

And I stop what few passengers there are,
and I say,

"Thank you for still flying."

Hello. You've reached Gander Academy.
This is Beulah Davis.

How can I help you?

He's gone.

It's over.

Oh, no.

I'm so sorry, Hannah.

I'm so sorry.

You are here

At the end of a moment

At the end of the world

You are here

On the edge of the ocean

Where the story ends

Where the river meets the sea

Here
Something's gone

Across the Atlantic
Something's over

At the office
In an airport

In my house

On an island
Something's rearranged

In a classroom
At the station

In my car

And wherever you are
Something's gone

You are here

When Gander Town Council declares
the state of emergency over,

it means everything goes back to normal.

Garth.
Claude!

Look.
Look.

Look at it from my perspective.
Will you look at it from my perspective?

We've been coming to the table.
We've been coming to the table too!

Jesus!

Morning, Crystal.
Morning, Mr. Mayor.

Pepsi? Yeah.
That's right.

Morning, Dwight.
Morning, Claude. Garth, Crystal.

Claude, Crystal, Dwight. Garth. Morning.

Morning, boys.
Morning, Janice.

Janice.
Janice.

Janice.
Janice.

What's the news?
Strike still on?

Well, we're coming to the table.
Well, we're coming to the table too.

They tearing down the airport?
Not today.

Mr. Mayor, I saw your car in the lot.

You might want to get down to town hall.

We just opened the suggestion box.

When the bank finally converted
all the currency from around the world,

people had donated over $60,000.

Every day for months,
passengers sent back chocolates, flowersâ€¦

Donations of all kinds.

Postcards and letters came in
from everywhere.

"Dear Miss Beulah,

When my daughter asks about
what happened to me over those five days,

I tell her about your kindness.

Thank you again. Sincerely, Ali.

Please send me the recipe
for the fish and the cheese."

Ralph the cocker spaniel went on to become
a champion show dog!

And Unga the rare bonobo chimpanzee
arrived safely at the Columbus Zoo.

And soon after, she had a baby,
which they named Gander.

Tom Brokaw phones me. Tom Brokaw.

He's doing a documentary,
and since I was the only reporter in town,

I'm the only one with any footage.

Tom Brokaw.

It was a big break,

but I didn't really like
shoving microphones into people's faces

when they were going through so much,
so I stayed here in Gander.

And I'm still here today
on the tenth anniversary.

I'm reporting live from Newfoundland
for BBC.

CBC.
CTV.

Al Jazeera.

For Rogers TV,
I'm Janice Mosher on September 11th.

2011.

The town is again filled
with come from aways.

On the tenth anniversary,
from all around the world,

we welcome back the plane people.

One, twoâ€¦
One, two, three, four!

Welcome to the friends
Who have come from away

Hep!
Welcome to the locals

Who have always said they'd stay
Hep!

If you're coming from Toledo
Or you're coming from Taipei

Because we come from everywhere
We all come from away

Welcome to the rock
I'm an islander

I am an islander

I'm an islander I am an islander

I'm an islander I am an islander

I'm an islander I am an islander

Welcome to our island
With its inlets and its bays

You could keep on heading east
But there's an ocean in the way

Where everything is meant to be
But nothing goes as planned

And the drunkest fellas in the room
Are playing in the band

Welcome to the rock

With all the new security,

kids aren't even allowed
up to the cockpit anymore.

Of course, on my retirement flight,

I brought my whole family up
to the cockpit on our way back to Gander.

I came back
with the scholarship money we raised,

now worth over a million dollars.

I bring out the Irish whiskey,
and we have ourselves a toast.

Nick and I just couldn't make
the long-distance relationship work.

So I moved to Texas, and then I proposed.

And we honeymooned in Newfoundland.

My new secretary's name is Robin.
What's up?

Every year on September 11th,
I close my office

and give each employee $100 to go and do
random good deeds for strangers.

It's my way of remembering what happened.

Beulah and I still keep in touch.

She even came to visit me in New York.

And I'll still phone her
if I hear a really stupid joke.

Beulah, why are Newfoundlanders terrible
at knock-knock jokes?

I don't know, Hannah.

Well, try it. I'll be a Newfoundlander.

Knock, knock.

Come on in. The door's open.

The donation we are most honored by
just arrived today.

It's about four meters long
and 1,200 kilograms.

Newfoundland is one of the only places
outside of the United States

where we share the steel
from the World Trade Center.

On the northeast tip of North America,
on an island called Newfoundland,

there's a airport.

And next to it is a town called Gander.

Tonight we honor what was lost.

But we also commemorate what we found.

You are here

At the start of a moment

On the edge of the world

Where the river meets the sea

Here

On the edge of the Atlantic

On an island in between

There and here
I'm an islander, I am an islander

I'm an islander, I am an islander
There and here

I'm an islander I am an islander

I'm an islander, I am an islander
There and here

I'm an islander I am an islander

I'm an islander I am an islander

Welcome to the fog

Welcome to the trees

A kiss and a cod
And whatever's in between

To the ones who've left
You're never truly gone

A candle's in the window
And the kettle's always on

To the coves and the caves
And the people from the planes

Five days.
Nineteen animals.

And 7,000 strays.

When the sun is setting
And it's darker than before

If you're hoping for a harbor
Then you'll find an open door

In the winter, from the water
Through whatever's in the way

To the ones who have come from away

We say welcome to the

Welcome to the, welcome to the
Welcome to the, welcome to the

Welcome to the, welcome to the rock!

Welcome to the townies
And the come from aways

Welcome to the locals
Who have always said they'd stay

My father's father's father
Crashed his ship into this rock

Heaven and hell don't matter much
'Cause it's here I'm stuck

Welcome to the rock
Welcome to Newfoundland

It's farther to Manhattan
Than it is to Ireland

They say no man's an island
But an island makes a man

Especially when one comes
From one like Newfoundland

I'm an islander I am an islander

I'm an islander I am an islander

I'm an islander I am an islander

I'm an islander I am an islander

Welcome to the wildest weather
That you've ever heard of

Where everyone is nicer
But it's never nice above

'Cause it's mauzy or it's misky
Or it's muddy or it's scad

And when it's finally sunny
It's a sign it's getting bad

Welcome to the rock
Welcome to Newfoundland

The drunkest fellas in the room
Are playing in the band

Welcome to the farthest place
You'll get from Disneyland

Fish and chips and shipwrecks
This is Newfoundland

Welcome to the land
Where the winters tried to kill us

And we said
We will not be killed

Welcome to the land
Where the waters tried to drown us

And we said
We will not be drowned

Welcome to the land
Where we lost our loved ones

And we said
We will still go on

Welcome to the land
Where the winds tried to blow

And we said no

In the winter, from the water
Through the wind

If a stranger ends up at our door

We welcome them in

We welcome them in

I am an islander

Welcome to the cod
And to the trees and to the fog

And to the ferries and the berries
And the failing fisheries

And to kitchen parties
To the ones departed

In our hearts
We know you'll never

Leave this little bit of heaven
Where we started

To the down
And the out of town on quads

And thanks to God we are the poorest
But the richest where it counts

And to the St. John's girls
With their sails unfurled

To our friends at the end of the world
We say

Welcome to the rock!
