I've lived in this city all my life.

I'm Max. And I am the luckiest dog in New York.

Because of her. That's Katie.

Katie and I, well, we have the perfect relationship.

We met a few years ago.

And, boy, let me tell you, we got along right away.

It's one of those relationships where...  where you just know.

And get this, she was looking for a roommate. And so was I.

So I just moved in that same day.

It was perfect.

We've been together every since.

Katie will do anything for me.

And I'm her loyal protector.

Our love is... Our love is... how do I put this.

Our love is stronger than words.

Or shoes.

It's me and Katie.

Katie and me.

Us against the world.

I'm not going to say that we're soul mates, even though any sane person who saw us would.

There's just one little problem.

Come on, Max.
Pretty much everyday, she leaves. 

I'll see you tonight 
Sometimes I try stuff to get her to stay.

Okay. Sit. Spin.

Speak. Okay. That's a good boy.

But it never works.

Where is she going?

What could she possibly be doing?

Oh, I miss her so much.

Oh, my oh, she's back.

Forgot my phone.

What took so long, why did you? Oh, come on.

Oh, I miss her so much.

Bye, Gidget. Be a good doggy.

Hey, Max.
Hey, Gidget.

Any plans today?

Yes, big big stuff today, Gidget.  I got big plans.  
I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna wait for Katie to come back.

Oh that sounds exciting. Well, I won't interrupt. I've got a very busy day too.

Here you go. See you later, Chloe.

Bye, Pepe.

So long, Mel.

Bye, Sweet Pea.

See you, Gino.

Bye.

I'll miss you, Shelly.

Later, Runty.

Bye everyone.

Bye ..

Oh..

You'll be a good boy, Leonard.

[ROCK MUSIC]

Hey, Max.
Hey, Chloe.

Do you ever wonder where they go during the day?

Do you know what, I just .. I just don't really care.

Maybe that's what its like for you, but Kate and I have a different relationship.

You know, you are a cat. Maybe that's why.

Because no one could ever love a cat they love a dog, just saying.

Maybe that's why.

Whatever you need to tell yourself.

Hey morning, Max.

Hey, guys.

Sup, Sweet Pea.

Hey Mel, where have you been, man?

Oh, get this. Last Sunday, my owner feeds me a small white pill, right.

 I start to feel a little groggy. The next thing I know, I wake up. I'm in the sky.

Wait a minute, the sky? - Yeah, there were suitcase everywhere. 

I'm locked up in a crate. 
Oh, come on. 

They're suitcases in the sky? 
So I pass out from fear.

And when I woke up, I'm in Florida.

Um, this did not happen.

I will never eat a pill like that again.

Unless if its covered in peanut butter.

Because, I mean, come on right .. its peanut butter.

Hey guys .. 
Oh, hey, Norman.

You're still looking for your apartment?

Yeah. Going on three weeks now. Is this the second or the third floor?

I do not know any numbers, but you do not live here.

Oh, pellets. See you guys later.

You know what, you can do it.

He can't do it.

Buddy, there you are .. Did you find it?

You know I did.

Voila.

Ball! - Ball, ball, ball.

Katie's going to be so excited. This is exactly like the one she's been looking for.

 I mean look at it. It's round. It fits in my mouth.

Ball!

There is no other ball in the city like this one the ball.

Guaranteed, this is the ball. 

Hey.

That's a good boy.

Oh yes, I so psyched to see you too buddy.

Okay, boy, calm down. It's okay. Let's all be calm.

Now I have some big news.

He's going to be your brother.

No, no, Max. Okay.

It's going to be alright, Duke.

It's okay.

Aw see, he likes you.

Yeah .. that's it Duke. Take a look around you.

So you and I are going to have to take care of him.

Love you, Maxxie.

Love you, Duke.

Sleep tight boys.

Hey .. little guy.

Maybe we could share.

You know, one night you get the bed.

That kind of thing. 
This is bed is mine.

You, you get an old blanket. That suits you.

You're an old blanket kind of a dog.

Oh, wow .. you are stubborn.

Hey, I get it. I'm stubborn too.

But we gotta learn to get along.

Wait, what are you .. 
I bet we can both fit in this bed if we really try to .. on it there. 

No, wait. 
Perfect.

This is comfy , right? 
No. It is not.

I'm comfy.

Duke is just ruining our lives.. He's ruining..  It's an emergency.

You must get rid of this dog, he stole my...

And he's scary. And he's frightening. And he's the death of all good things.

Oh, you little cutie pie.

Are you trying to get rid of me?

Before I answer that, I'd like to know how much you heard

So that's how its gonna be.

Oh man, you're making me angry.

And when I get angry .. I'm do this.

And I want to do that. I need this place.

And if it's gonna come down to you or me... It's gonna be me.

Good morning, Max. Max, what are you doing?

Chloe .. Chloe, Chloe. I got a bad situation.

Katie has brought home a new dog from the pound.

She said he's my brother, I don't want a brother.

And I don't even have a bed now.

I'm sleeping on the floor. Like a dog. Why would Katie do this to me?

Because she's a dog person, Max.

And dog people do weird and inexplicable things.

Like .. they like dogs instead of cats.

Okay, please don't start now, Chloe. That is not helping.

Max, come on .. I was your friend.

Okay? Because I'm your friend, I'll be honest with you. And I do not care about you and your problems.

But .. if you do not do something about him, and soon ..

Your perfect human life with a stupid ending.

Forever. - Forever?

Forever. Yeah, that's what I .. why it stuck in my nails.

Listen .. if you want to position your back, you have to start acting like the alpha dog.

Correct. Alpha dog. I can do that.

Please do not go. - Okay, okay. This time please do not go.

I'm running late. I have to go. - Wait! Wait..

Fixed look at me. Spinning, I was doing the rounds.

You're okay here. See you again.

Wait, no, no .. - Okay, Max.

But he's crazy.

Now sit down. - Okay. Okay. Okay.

Friends, really, where is Max?

Come down, man, he's .. Uh?

We are pet waste.

Discarded by our owner, and now we want revenge!

It's like a club, but with violence.

Take us with you.

I do not think so, Pets!

Yes, you smell like a pet.

You choose your side, and now you regret it.

No, stop!

Who would you call a pet? I'm not a pet.

You're all wrong, we're just like you.

We hate humans. - Oh, yes!

I hate them. - That's right!

Oh man, do not get me started talking about people.

I was right, Duke? - Yes.

That's why we burn our necklaces, man!

We burn it!

And kill its owner! - Yes! Wait a minute..

Maybe it's too much? - No, they loved it.

Yes, we beat them! - Yes, it is true.

Bang, bang, with a shotgun.

If I got money for every owner that I had killed ..

Oh, yes. - I got one chip,

because I only killed one person.

Oh waw!

You're a cold-blooded!

Ah, you remind me of my friend, Ricky.

But he was already dead. Rest in peace, Ricky!

In fact, this struggle takes more energy.

I'll tell you.

We will expel you both from here, but from now you work for me.

No problem. - Sounds like a fun challenge.

All right, let's do this!

To selokannya! - Selokannya?

What are you waiting for? I do not play!

Looks like you need help.

In the dark this forbidden place.

Uh, halo?

I could see only a few miles.

If you get me out, I'll find your friend.

Waw! Is it true? Oh, you're very good.

You're too sweet. - Oh oh!

Thank you, stranger.

But not too sweet. Also there saltiness.

Yes, that's me. Let's get out of here.

Yes, that is so.

A pile of bones Langkahi.

A pile of bones. OK.

Ah, I hope Max is fine.

You are very wise food.

Food? I did not say that, I told a friend.

I told you, I mean food. Friend..

You know what I mean. - I believe I was lucky to meet you.

Tiberius, and yes, and there is a very good thing for you, whatever you want.

Remove the head cover.

Katie!

You want to eat me? - Sorry.

You must apologize, you deserve in parentheses.

You're a naughty bird! - I can not help it.

I was born with a killer instinct. - It is not an excuse.

You're right, even for a predator I'm selfish.

I'm a selfish predators.

No wonder I do not have friends.

Nothing anyone.

It's useless. - Oh, no, no need to cry.

I'm sorry, you've cried before ..

Please remove these chains, this time I'll help you, I promise.

Tiberius, this is going to sound really scary but,

I do not fully believe in you.

Oh, no .. no .. but, I think all deserve a second chance

and you're just a lonely old bird

and has a strange attitude because you live in a strange cage on the roof.

So I tell you, if you find Max, I'll be your best friend.

A good friend?

You and me?

Yeah, that sounds good.

Let's do this.

Okay.

So what it looks like Max?

Brown and white, she has short hair.

Very handsome, flickering in his eyes .. - It sounds obvious he was not.

You do not know at all, I mean, whatever, silent.

If the lord come to wear headgear and pretending to be me.

Okay, thanks.

Ah, the smell is disgusting ..

Nice, is also remarkable. I love being here.

Leaders who create a password, stupid! Okay, I'll create a new password now.

The new password is not asking the password to the leader!

Follow me.

Welcome to the Brotherhood bladder, homes for the pets.

Brothers and sisters dear ..

As you can see I've been back from the surface along with two new members.

These animals are master assassin.

Hei! Hei! Tenang!

Friends, I want you to tell them how you did it.

Please tell all of them about how you killed your master.

Oh, yes. - Tell us.

True. Okay. Okay, so - Tell them, Max.

Hey, man, I know what the name of that machine, we just do away with the machine.

But it is a blender.

Well, you all hear this?

You know who that looks like this?

Ricky, rest in peace.

Ricky, represented the only soldier I've ever had, which is ready to kill a human in sight.

Everything takes practice.

Not the brothers.

See, we all, had suffered at the hands of humans.

I mean, take me as an example.

I used rabbit magician for children's parties.

But then, the rabbit trick failed.

So what did my master? My Lord, leave me magic and disappear.

Of life.

Uh-huh, I live in a tattoo,

first people who practice I often use as a training tool.

Until they get to the space.

I mean, yes, people say they love us.

But then they turned and threw us out like garbage.

That's right, is not it? Marcus.

Hey, this is not our fault if we do not look like you.

Yes.

Okay, you guys join this fraternity.

This is the time of initiation.

What? - Sorry, what time?

Okay, show him!

I have a cat, I landed with my legs.

It is always the case, because the head looks often landed.

You want me to catch you, because I'll catch it this way ..

Okay, he's too stupid to talk, too bad to eat.

I'm sick of being nice, where Max?

Uh .. - Tell me!

Help me!

Do not look at him, look at me, there is no one who can help you.

There is where the Max!

Okay, okay, he's in the sewers.

Let me go, please ..

Forgive me, beautiful dog.

As proof of your loyalty, you will receive a sting from one canine, rattlesnakes blonde.

as a symbol of anti-human!

Who wants to go first?

Uh, here's the problem, I mean, it's .. well .. - A small dog.

What should I call you little dog? It suits you, more or less so.

Listen, between you and the dog fat ..

I'm more like you. - Why, thank you.

Small dogs will start first, everything, the little dog will start first.

No, no, no small dog wants to go first, take the dog with fat.

No, no .. stop!

Sting sting .. ..

No, no ..

What are you guys doing, initiate a pet?

Pet?

Yeah, just being chased by two dogs in the gang, was killed his master.

No, no, that's not true. You said it was killing the host.

Well, burned, lost, stolen by the cat, it's just a play on words, right?

You do not deserve the mark by a rattlesnake,

Oh no. We will go out alone. - You guys deserve it eaten by rattlesnakes.

Catch a pet it!

You may deserve, accept this, it should have done from the first.

But, it should not happen like this, he's not in my leadership.

Exit!

Max, disappeared. He's out there somewhere.

Lost, frightened, very very handsome ..

We must find and bring it home.

But the outside world was very loud and scary.

What was a hawk?

This is my friend. Tiberius, he will help us.

He will not eat us, we have already discussed.

Come on, we're out there without a rope, we will be caught with a net.

Or worse. - Yes, like a hawk!

We dispose of a waste of time, Max needs us.

Come on, Max did not even know you're alive.

I do not care. I love him. I love her with all my heart.

And I'll find Max, and I do not care who will participate.

So, who will come?

All right, all right.

Oh come on, man, I can not believe it.

When my nails stuck in the blinds, who dropped?

Max is dropped.

Buddy, Mel, when you are treated, who taught you sitting comfortably?

Max! - Max!

Max who taught me. - And when the wild cat tried to eat Sweepy.

Who saved him?

That's not a wild cat, you who want to eat it.

The identity of the cat was not a problem. We talk about who saved him.

Max to save him! - We have to save him.

We have to save Max.

Yes, let's go save Max.

Which Max?

Tiberius .. Do not!

Birds are evil!

Sweet little mouse, little mouse sweet.

I love this bird, mad bird.

Come on.

We have to go to the coast.

I only know YuHan dog, I do not know who else.

Swim small dog, swim.

[Ferries Big Apple]

Duke!

Please!

Max, reach its tires.

I .. I can not.

Keep trying Max. You can..

Well .. You're not very good. But you do not drown, and it was something.

You're almost there.

Thanks Duke.

Do not think about it. - Finally, I'm going home.

Ah is it really?

They went to Brooklyn.

They said everybody went to Brooklyn lately.

Make a back stage action.

I'm not talking about the Trance, I'm talking about revenge.

It will go to Brooklyn. And has teeth, and hairy tail.

Let's go.

[# MUSIC]

Hi, how are you?

Alright.

Drink, drink, drink!

What place is this?

This place Pops, this house is always empty, this is a great gathering place.

Pops knew everybody in this town, if he wants to help, Max would be found.

Cool. - Oh incredible.

Tell me you get the picture.

Of course I got it. - Hello Peanut, what you see Pops?

Yes, she was there.

Marshmelow..
Hai Pops!

Sweet potatoes. - Pops!

Who is that? What?

Oh hei Buddy.

How are you?

Paralyzed.

Nice. Mr. Pops, our friend Max was abducted, the last we heard she was in the gutter.

Buddy said that if possible, you can help us?

You know I did know the people in the gutter. Well, I do not go out anymore.

Disposing waste of time.

Who said that? - Oh, I said it, I did not mean to offend.

I just .. Did you see yourself? - Wah, wah, wah ..

Look what we got here. I want to see it.

Miron, alis!

Oh no..

Oh yes, I like what I see.

All I can see is, a cat charming.

Miss, this is my town, I'll find your friend.

Well, the party is over.

Miron, vakum.

So where are you from my beautiful angel?

Dude I'm a cat. - Well no protest.

I am very hungry.

Ah man, look at the sandwich.

Correct.

Time to work.

No .. no ..

Ok .. All will be fine. We could find their way home.

We are descendants of the mighty wolf.

We have wild instincts.

Which soon will take over, and take us home.

I can not wait, it is!

Anything?

No.

Wait!

There is no.

I do not know Duke, perhaps the legend that dogs originated from wolves was wrong.

I mean, maybe one puppy asks, where we come from.

And his mother said, Wulff, and the boy was like, oh wolf?

And he said, yeah right. - Sausages!

Huh?

You smell that?

Oh man. It is .. - Sausages!

Then what are we waiting for?

We are going toward you dear!

Lower the ladder.

Who are they?

It is a fur ball, and the face of the box.

Wiener dog, yellow birds, and eagles, big rats.

And of course my girlfriend Rhonda.

100 percent wrong.

Quite good.

Come on, let's go.

Every instinct my bird, says do not follow the dog using the wheel.

Uh .. Mr. Pops, do not we need to go into the ditch?

If we take these people will take one day to get there.

You've probably got a lot of lives but to me every breath is a gamble.

So we have to take this secret service.

Okay, these are the secret of death.

Well, that's enough I think.

Come on!

Down here!

Help me?!

Keep moving.

Oh no.

Stop it! Look away!

Come on, I do not have all day.

Come on slow!

What smell is this?

It is a waste disposal site.

The aroma is getting stronger.

Oh my goodness.

Duke, let's eat!

Oh ya!

Oh, the aroma is very tasty!

Oh ya!

Sausage!

Come on, friends!

Ya!

Do you know? I mean it may chatter sausage, but you're okay.

That's right folks!

You know when you first met me like 'oh I do not like it' '.

But now that I've known I was like 'I love her!' '.

You know I've seen this place from the outside.

If I knew what treasures that are here, I'm going to break down the door of her from the first.

What are you talking about?

Pemilikku used to live here.

Dude, wait, you said you used to have an owner?

Well, it's been a long time, I do not want to talk about it.

Yes talk, come on!

I do not know..

but what do you know? He used to be very cool.

Ya?

Yes, he's the best.

And we have fun.

We played catch throwing!

Our streets!

We both slept. We both like to sleep.

I went out one night, chasing butterflies or car.

When I catch it and eat it ..

Then maybe butterflies.

I know I've gone too far from home and I can not go back.

A few days later I was arrested animal control.

My past was great, but ..

I've blown it.

Duke, we have to go to your house!

No. - You know, your master will be pleased.

Really? But he never find me.

Maybe he .. he does not like me.

Of course he likes you, he is your master.

I mean maybe she is very worried.

I do not know. - I know, and we'll find.

Your master will be pleased, I've just loved the thought.

Okay.

Let's do it.

There they are!

Let the dog, come here.

You think you're going where?

Do not!

Rabbit, he and his crazy eyes!

No one knows what's wrong with that thing!

Listen, this is my opinion.

Maybe there's a dog in the neighborhood that are similar Max.

Begin acquainted with them, after a while you will forget him.

We will not give up, we are dedicated, we are loyal, we are the best pets.

We are a dog!

Cat. - Eagle.

Congratulations! Today you are a dog, whether you like it or not.

Nice.

Now let's find the rabbit Max before it.

Let's go!

Hey, this is ...

Damn it.

Well, they're here.

Nice. We're close. It is dasarjahat action, people.

Destruction. - This is it. That.

I know. - Hey. Here, I think ..

Oh, lightweight bombs just melt my brain.

The hare had an idea.

Okay, so, how do I look?

You look great.

How do I smell her? - Like a dog, pal.

Relaxed, buddy.

There it was.

Well, there. Scratching the door.

Remember the sausage factory? It was fun, right?

Are you step-back?

No, why do you think so?

Let's walk to talk about what you think I reverse-reverse?

Friend, you do not have anything to be nervous. They will be glad to see you.

Okay.

A new car.

Can I help you?

No, we're good. thanks.

You're not good, you look gross. I have to ask again, away from my place.

Before I became dumb. You know. What are you already.

This is my house. - Buddy, maybe we should go.

And why, why Fred wanted a cat? He hates cats.

It is one of the things I liked about him.

Fred, the old people? He..

She died.

Duke, maybe I made a mistake here. Come on, let's go.

You are a liar. Cats can lie all the time.

Do not blown it.

Who are they?

Hey, this is my home. Go.

Duke, it's time to go.

Duke, let's go. Come on. It's not your house anymore.

Why did you bring me here, Max? - Wait a minute. It is my fault?

You know, I'm trying to help you. - You're trying to get rid of me.

Yes, you know what, Duke. I do not need this. I .. See you later.

Wow. Wow. Come on, calm down.

Go home, Max.

Hey, help me here. - Hold, here I come.

Time to take you, big fella. Come on. Just it. You.

Duke!

Oh, the house-house-house.

Small dog.

Oh, are you kidding?

You think this is over, the little dog?

Attack karate! - Wait!

You do not! Can you get away from me!

We became a great team, a small dog! Most of whom I do work hard.

But you helped. - Yes, yes, good. Just keep looking over the street.

You're driving like an animal.

What is that? You rammed it intentionally. - Oh, it was a hole.

You do not know me very well, OTD.

I always check.

Did you see Van her?

That is all. We're going to hit.

Relaxed, Snowball, I got you.

There he is!

She caught Snowball.

Yey!

Look, pal. This is not apparently.

Shut up.

You will take the boss.

No, no, no. Snowball and I were in the same time now.

Tell him, Snowball, tell them.

Okay. - Oh, great. You're in love.

All repugnant to everyone. Let's go!
