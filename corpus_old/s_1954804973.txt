He's closer.
Potatoes.

His brother has just come home.

Let it go, okay, Mom.

But do not stay up too late.

Until midnight and
not a minute more.

Well, Dad ...

Thank you. It is for the new CD

We are so proud of you.
I love you.

This is awesome!

Hilltop Mall, Kearney,
Nebraska, 17:30 H

Sorry.

Help!

Help!

Somebody help me!

Somebody help me!

Help!

The vehicle is registered in
name of one Don Slaughty.

Who?
Slut, Slut Don.

And Anne appears as Slut
the major driver.

What? You know?

I open.

No, it was the home of Paige.
It was a few hours ago.

And went to the mall.
She'd buy a CD.

He called for Paige?
Elaine.

Witnesses saw as the
forced to enter into a van.

19:30 H
Kidnapping two hours more

Should not have yelled.

Why did you do that?

Answer me, why he cried?

Because he was grabbing me.

Well, sit down.

Come, sit.

Here.

It's a turkey,
two white occupants.

A 17 year old girl ...

It is believed that it is dangerous.

In most abductions
contact the family.

So let's install here
to trace the call.

Dave, I need it in the fax.

For money? A ransom?

Do not know yet. So we
to prepare ourselves if by chance you call.

So hopefully, nothing else?

You must stay here.
Doing nothing?

In the case of the kidnapper to call.

Splendid!
Tom, let them do their job.

Lord, what is happening?
Where is Anne?

We have to do
some questions.

No problem.
Understand that can be annoying.

Go down.

God, please.

No. ..
Be quiet.

Just stay quiet.
Do not hurt me.

Do not tell anyone.

I promise I will not say,
I will not say anything

Please let me go.

Please do not do it.

I propose a deal.

If you take the tape, let you go.

It's funny.

Time is running out.

Lost.

Could untie my hands?
I think we are still bleeding.

Let me see.

Be quiet.
Do not do it.

There is something in the face.
Do not touch me.

Let me go!

Family home slut, 22:35, Kearney,
Nebraska, 5 hours after the abduction

There are many reporters out there.

The more people come
Anne's face on television,

more options
that will let us know.

And there will be fewer places
this guy can hide.

You have the picture of Anne.
What are we waiting for?

Maybe not
goes as planned.

The gunman may
panic.

And it is a risk that
we have to consider.

Well, the story is already out there or
That is, is all over the news.

Put a photo of Anne help.

We should do that.

Tell us what you do, Mike.

Here it comes.
Detective ...

Lord ...
A question ...

There are approximately 5 hours,
Anne slut 17 years

was kidnapped
Hilltop Mall

by a white man
unidentified.

Anne measures 1.50 m.

Has brown hair
and blue eyes.

And it is with a blouse
Pink and blue jeans.

We ask all people here and
neighboring cities that remain watchful

and inform local police if
see Anne and her abductor.

When they were last seen
were in a dark blue van

with Louisiana plates.

Detective ...
Detective ...

Detective, the FBI is involved
in this investigation?

Well, if there is some indication that
Anne has been taken from the Nebraska

certainly will contact the FBI.

Detective ...
Detective ...

Not sure that almost 5%
of abducted children

are killed in the first
3 hours of the abduction?

That depends on
many circumstances.

And it is true that after
24 hours statistics

that are found alive
are virtually nil?

So we enlisted the help and
cooperation of all in this matter.

That was all. Thanks.

That's all there is?

I'm still here!

I'm still here!

Help!

Help me!

I can not move!

Please, please
I can not hold.

Please help me out.

I can not move!

Please.

My God, please
please help me.

My God, my God.

Please help me.

Please
help me or I'll drown.

I saved his life.

You're mine.

Family House Slut, Day 2

That's it.

Are we ready?
What do I say?

Stay calm and try to keep it
on the line as long as possible.

Very good. Ready?

Hello?

No, do not give interviews.

Imbeciles!

If you see or hear another reporter ...
I'll handle this.

Yes, I'm in the house now.

Lady Slut.
How did you here?

Get out now.

You are making a mistake.
Out of my house!

Get it here.
Tom, all is well.

We changed a little here.

I can see.
She is the Renalds agent, FBI.

FBI?

The plate was from Louisiana and can
be leaving the state with her.

And that translates into a
federal investigation.

So can Anne
be anywhere.

Arthur, Nebraska, Day 2

Come on, keep walking.

Try walking barefoot
with bleeding feet.

Shows character.
The bleeding feet?

Pain.

I am a family friend.
Are waiting for me.

Come on! Come on!

Come on!

Yes!

I really thank you.
It is best to get her out of here.

This will help.

I do not think well leave.

Elaine does not think about it.

You need rest.
Awake 36 hours.

Even a few hours
sleep in my house

away from it all would
very well for you.

Thanks, Diane.

Take care of everything here.

Okay, Mom.

Torrington, Wyoming, near the
Nebraska border, Day 2

Are you hungry?
Yes.

What's your name?

You can grab a cookie, Anne.

What's your name?

They call me Jack.

As the Jack Rabbit.
Fast and strong.

Should do much exercise.

It's always good to find something
do. Help cool the mind.

You're fine.

Very good.

You may eat another.

My grandmother and my sister
were from a Catholic school.

If we confess our sins

then He is faithful and just
and forgive our sins.

Maybe.

You know? There are probably many
people looking for me.

Perhaps I should say
someone I'm fine.

Perhaps there would be less
problems that way.

Want to call home and say:
"Damn, I'm your daughter?"

I can say that was my idea.

Not even have to be my
parents can call a friend.

And say what went on vacation?

Yes, of course.

Closes it.

The sink!

Diane meets.

What do I say?
Say hello, be natural.

Come on, answer.

Hello? Hello?

Hi, Elaine is?

No, not Elaine
it is now.

You know him?
Anne?

Yes.
Anne where are you?

I'm fine. At least
I'm not sore or anything.

How we'll bring you home?
Hopefully soon.

I could say to Elaine
I called?

Are you ...? Anne?

We track?
No, not last long enough.

Holiday, waiting
that said vacation.

Hung up before.
You took too long.

Calls another person,
another friend.

Alive. Anne is alive, we
tell that to Don and Elaine

Sure.

Kate, I want a recording?

Hi, Elaine is?

No, not Elaine
it is now.

You know him?
Hear that?

Looks like highway traffic.
Of course.

Anne where are you?

I'm fine. At least
I'm not sore or anything.

Listen.
How we'll bring you home?

Hopefully, soon.

I could say to Elaine
I called?

They listened carefully to
Elaine said she?

The gunman should be with her.

Why not ask the mother.

I knew we'd be here.

Whatever it is by what is
spending is targeted.

Hello?
Paige?

My God!

My god is alive!
Where are you?

Okay?
I'm fine.

Do not worry.

Just ... want some
Holiday equity.

Good girl.

I think we can now
start our vacation.

She called?
Yes.

Elaine, I could hear well.
What'd she say?

Also called Paige.
We have the tape.

Did you hear his voice?
We know which track to follow?

Did little to track down but we know
who called for a highway phone.

Listen.

Hello?
Paige?

My God!

My god is alive!
Where are you?

Okay?
I'm fine.

Do not worry.

Just ... want some
Holiday equity.

Wait. Listen carefully
the last thing she said.

I'm fine. Do not worry.

Just ... want some
Holiday equity.

Anne did not say vacation
quality but of fairness.

Just ... want some
Holiday equity.

What does it mean?
Equity.

Wyoming is the state of equity.

How is she so smart?

Yes it is.

That the authorities in Wyoming
should be aware of a blue van.

At least we have
where to start.

Somewhere
Wyoming, Day 2

So where do we go on vacation?

The Washington?

With all those trees

or the desert, Nevada?

Or Ukon?

Nobody will find us there.

Always wanted to go to Ukon.

Some boys were gathered

in the canteen.

A song in the Jukebox.

At the bar, in a solitary game,

sat the dangerous
Dan McGroove

and seeing their luck

was his lover

a girl named Lou.

Somehow it
involving the eyes

and held the gaze

like a charm.

As he looked at me and

as a man who
living in hell.

His face covered
practically by the hair

and his look depressing.

I thought my day was over.

He looked at the green liquid
in your cup

and a drop fell, one by one.

And then he was alone

when the moon
terribly light.

I saw mountains and valleys

but silence is the same here.

And then suddenly

the music changed.

So soft that frightened
just listen to it

and feels his life is wiped

of all that once wanted.

They stole it from you.

The woman he loved, his
love was a lie of the devil

that God had forgotten her

and the best for you
was to shrink and die.

The heart cry of despair.

And kills you slowly.

I think not
can remain so.

So the danger is
out there in the world.

Nor have
a black dress.

Livingston, Montana, Day 5

Go down.

And do not slam the door.

Perfect.

I've thought of everything.

Let's live in the mountains.

Work the land.

But stay away.
It is far.

It's the best part of it.

You have to eat the food.

Eat.

Eat!

My grandmother always said,

Tonny, eat or anything
will not eat again.

Probably learned
with his English family.

English?
Yes.

And why are you here?

I'm not that bad.

See.

Thanks for dinner.

Yes

I have a gift for you.

Want me to put?

No, put in another finger.

At the other finger.

Yes

Yes

Beautiful.

I have to urinate.

911, what is your emergency?

We are in Montana?
Yes.

I need help.
They kidnapped me.

Kidnapped me in a
parking Nebraska.

Yes, guns and knives.

Do you know where?
In a cabin in the woods.

Where is he now?

Anne called 911. Are

Yes!
My God!

Livingston, Montana, Day 5

Search in all files

our suspect.

How much time will come
someone to the hut?

Already there. My team
is the surrounding.

Apparently listen
voices inside.

Come get some, right?
Yes, they will.

You have to save it.
We do our best, ma'am.

She left a message.

How are there not?
What?

What was that?
They are not there.

But you said ...
Yes, sorry.

Were there.
Sit far?

Prometheus.
Where were they?

They promised that would bring.
Sorry!

I promised!
But were not there.

They heard voices.
They said it was there.

Was there and left a message
saying they were heading north.

You are in Livingston,
know that, right?

Calm down, Tom
Not so simple.

I do not understand this,
yes it is very simple.

Did you hear, go to the north.
Wait a minute.

You take a long time.

We can not expect
things have resolved themselves, Dad.

Stay calm.
No, wait no more, Dad.

I will go alone!

Mike!
I care.

What are we doing here?

Just expect phone calls.

Anne is out. You are in Livingston
and we know it's there.

We are hoping e. ..
I'll bring it back.

Tom, you have to stay calm.
Me calm down?

We sit here day.
This is crazy!

We must go after her!
What are you doing?

I'll look for my sister.
The police are doing this.

So they are not doing
a good job, huh?

Lord Timbrook,
Please let me go.

That does not help his family.
This is not helping Anne.

You have to stay here with her parents!

Out of my way!

Sorry.
I understand.

Why do it?

Why?
Why call the police?

Just for you!

Eventually, I'll put a bullet
in your head right now.

I know how to think.

Can I help you.

Need to be there.

Who cares?

We have to make some
questions about Tony.

Not deep enough.

Please do not kill me well.

Want to die?

Please do not.
Keep digging.

Does not have to do this!
Yes I am!

I trusted you.

So cava.
Make yourself!

Grab it!
Or what? Kill me?

See that? I am the Jack Rabbit.

He was seen driving a van

Do not shoot. It's a girl.

This is all your fault.
It's your fault.

Caught us.

I have not in sight.

Repeat. Without sight.

Let's call 911

No, do not want to talk!
They want to kill me!

It's okay, we want to live.

Everything will be alright.

Is pointing to the girl.

How far?
Nearly one meter.

Not going back to prison.

I'll talk to them.

I'll call them.

... Surrounded.

Well done, Tony.

Careful what you'll say.

Tony Zappa?
No, I am.

Not the Zappa, is Anne.

It's who's calling.
What?

I know, this is new.

The hostage making the connection.
Let me talk to her.

Mike, this is a case of the FBI.
I know her.

So I brought it, right?

Caution, do not reveal who knows,
if Zappa is listening.

Here is Mike Timbrook.
I'm with the police.

Hello, this is Anne.
Anne, are you okay?

Yes, I'm fine.
Tony wants to see me?

Not sure.
Want to talk to you.

No, do not want to talk to them.

It's a trick, I want
close the window to get hit.

If I approached the bush, I swear!

I'm here.

Anne, we are here to meet
a viable solution for everyone.

Tell Tony that nobody
will shoot from cooperating.

Try, wait.

They want to cooperate.
I will not cooperate.

That was what my grandmother said.

I said: Whatever
tell you, Tony.

What do you think your grandmother
I would say at this point?

Anne, are you there?

Tony wants to talk to his grandmother.

Give us one minute
and pass the link.

What do you think you're doing?

This is not the policy of the FBI.

Every minute that this man should be
the phone, Anne will remain alive.

Hello?
Grandma?

Grandma, I am.

Tony?
Yes.

It's true what they say in
TV about you and that girl?

I'm afraid, grandmother.

Do not be afraid
Jesus, Tony.

I'll kill her.

Then I'll shoot myself.

Put the gun to my chest.

I'll kill myself.
Do not talk nonsense, not listen.

Strike team, get ready.

I'll pray for you.
Ask forgiveness from Jesus.

In the name of Jesus Christ,
our Lord,

prays that brings peace

Tony, nobody will shoot you!

Lower your weapons!
